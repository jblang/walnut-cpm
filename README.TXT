the subdirectories and their description on the disc.  Use the cursor
keys to move the highlight bar up and down the screen, then press
ENTER to change into any of the subdirectories.  The VIEW program
will then display a list of files within that particular

Lookup Program

Usage:   d:lookup.exe <any_word>  (where d: should be your CDROM drive name)

The lookup program looks up any word on the cdrom.  (Only source and text
files are indexed.)  The program is a command line program only for now.
Usage is

	d:lookup.exe <any_word>

The program displays the full path and file name and the text line
from the file.  You may redirect the output to a file if you wish.
