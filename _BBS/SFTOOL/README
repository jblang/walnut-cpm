A directory listing for each directory on the cdrom is in \bbs\sf.
These listings are in spitfire format.

In this directory is a batch file called "all.bat".  You can use this batch
file to create the same kind of bbs sffiles.<x> listings that are in \bbs\sf,
if you don't like the numbers I used for <x>.  Copy the batch file to your hard
disc and edit it.  Change the cdrom letter and where you want the spitfire
index files to go.  Then change the starting number by changing the '1' in the
lines:

%cdrom%\_bbs\each_dir 1    %cdrom%\_bbs\dirs.txt   doit1
%cdrom%\_bbs\each_dir 1    %cdrom%\_bbs\dirs.txt   doit

to the number you want.  Then the batch file will create index files starting
with your number.
