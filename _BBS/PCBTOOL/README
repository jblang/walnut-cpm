A directory listing for each directory on the cdrom is in \_bbs\pcb.
These listings are in pcboard format.  

In this directory is a batch file called "all.bat".  This batch file calls
'dirlst.exe' which outputs the correct format for pcboard's 'dirs.lst' master
index file.  To use this, edit the "all.bat" file.  You have to put the correct
drive and path of the cdrom index file.  This is in 

	<drive letter>:\bbs\pcb

(notice no trailing backslash).

Notice that because I run this batch file to set up the cdrom, i don't have
anything in the directory where i put my index files.  The batch file erases
everything in the directory you specify where it should put the index files.
(Edit the batch file and delete the line "echo y | del *.*" from the batch file
to get rid of this.)

You can also edit the dirs.lst file with a binary editor like
norton's utilities to change drive letters from the letter i used,
'm', to the drive letter of your cdrom.

If you like, you can copy the file descriptions to another drive (such as a
faster hard disk).  You will need to update the dirs.lst to reflect this move.

Make a backup first before you try editing dirs.lst this way.  I'm NOT a
pcboard sysop.  Feedback is welcome.
