This disc has the cumulative efforts of 10 years of CP/M development.
With over 20,000 files in about 500 MB, this is the definative
collection of CP/M software.  Almost every piece of freeware and
shareware ever written for the CP/M computer is here, collected from
around the world.

You'll find almost everything you could want for your 8088 and Z80
CP/M machine, from utilties to games to source code to text files.  A
shell lets you browse the directories and a full word look up program
finds key words anywhere on the disc almost instantly.

The disc is set up for rbbs, opus, pcboard, wildcat, maximus, and
spitfire BBS software.
