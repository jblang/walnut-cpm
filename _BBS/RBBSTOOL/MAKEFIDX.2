
* A filespec will do a "DIR <filespec>" to get a listing of the
* files.   DOS normally puts the directory name near the top in
* the format "Directory of ".   If this is not true, you must
* specify an alternate way for the Directory to be identified.
* NOTE: use the following if you are using 4DOS rather than DOS
* (remove the "*" at the front).

*/DirString=    Directory:

* Note:  Normally you will NOT want to include any FileDir specs.
* This is for loading lists of directories NOT on-line on your
* system.
*
* List as many as you have of text files with file names in
* them.  The file name must be at the beginning of each line.
* It may include a drive/path.  If no drive path, a line with
* "Directory of " following by drive/path should be included at
* the top of the file.   Note: all listed files will be added
* even if they are duplicates.   If you use CMPBBS to manage your
* new files to avoid duplicates and trim down BBS lists to just
* the new files, you should have only one entry here.
