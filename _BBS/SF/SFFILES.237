PUBPTZ10.LBR   52,480  06-08-93  A re-issue of Bridger Mitchell's PUBlic patch for CP/M with an added twist - I have adapted it for use with Echelon's ZRDOS17, replacing the 'public' user-area method. **Not tested extensively, be careful**
ZRDOS-WS.LBR   19,712  06-08-93  ZRDOS documentation formatted for hardcopy for those who prefer it that way. Formatted for WordStar. Contains comprehensive table of contents and documentation on public directory facility.
ZRDPUB10.LBR   13,824  06-08-93  The purpose of this code is to kludge up a solution to the problem of certain programs wiping out ZRDOS public directory definitions. It has been tested with ZCPR 3.3 and ZRDOS 1.7. It may or may not work with other versions of this o/s, though judging by my ZRDOS docs it should work with versions that go as far back as 1.2 (first public ZRDOS?), and I see no good reason why it shouldn't work with other versions of ZCPR.
