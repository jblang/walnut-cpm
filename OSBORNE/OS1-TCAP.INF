Subject: Termcap: Osborne-1

Newsgroups: comp.os.cpm

Someone asked for a termcap entry for Osborne-1. I've lost the name,
but the termcap I sent was a loser.  This one (below) is much better.
It's probably not of wide interest, so I won't go into further details
here.  Email any comments or improvements.

# O1 is Z80 cpu, CP/M, 24r x 52c real screen but w/ 32r x 128c virtual 
# screen. Some machines have an 80col card and suitable 
# monitor.  O1 has 10 programmable function keys. OTERM terminal software 
# by Michael Rubenstein, (available from FOG, SIMTEL etc) permits use of
# these.
#
# Two-letter id's were chosen arbitrarily to put this in the misc category
# and not duplicate. If you're putting this into the big Berkley db you 
# might want grep zo & zq to ensure they don't conflict w/ existing entries.
#
# Note: If using OTERM, the 'line' setting of OTERM must be at least 1 greater
# than co.  Delays appear to be necessary but sombody may be able to tune
# them to better efficiency.
