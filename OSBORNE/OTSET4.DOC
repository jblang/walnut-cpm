OTSETUP  is  used to install extended  function  key 
definitions in OTERM.   See OTERM.DOC for details on 
using extended function keys.

The syntax for OTSETUP is

  otsetup <fkey file> <OTERM input> <OTERM output>

Only  the  fkey file is required.   The OTERM  input 
file defaults to oterm.com as does the output  file.  
Only  those parts of the input or output OTERM  file 
names which differ from the default need be entered.
For example:

  otsetup fkeys b: b:

will use b:oterm.com and create b:oterm.com.

In  all cases,  if a file with the same name as  the 
output  already  exists it will be renamed  with  an 
extenstion of .bak.

The  fkeys  file contains the extended function  key 
definitions in the form:

name /function key value/

The  name  may  be from 1 through  127  alphanumeric 
characters.   Upper  and lower case are  equivalent.  
The "/"s may be any printing character.   The  func-
tion key value may contain any characters except the 
delimiter  specified (including carriage returns and 
line feeds).

Any number of carriage returns,  line feeds,  spaces 
or  control characters may appear between  the  name 
and the delimiter or before the next name.

Commands may be entered in the function key value as 
for  files  by entering esc <digit> for  a  function 
key.

Control  characters may be entered in the  file,  or 
may be entered as esc <char>.   For example,  esc a, 
would generate ^A.  Rubout may be entered as esc ?.

Note: To  enter  a control character with  WordStar, 
      precede it with control p.

Example:

a  /function key a/

verylongfunctionkeynamebutnotevenclosetomax

/line1
line2
line3
/

commands
=^[1log on
xmodem rc file.txt
^[1wait 20
^[1send file.txt
=

In the last definition, ^[ is an escape character.

If   a  function  key  is  defined  with  the   name 
OTERMINIT,   it  will  be  executed  when  OTERM  is 
started.   If one is defined with the name OTERMEND, 
it   will  be  executed  at   program   termination.  
OTERMEND  may not contain a file read  command,  but 
otherwise  these function keys follow the same rules 
as others and may be executed manually.
