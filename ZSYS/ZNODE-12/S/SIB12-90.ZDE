                           October 9, 1990

     The meeting opened with introductions of all present and brief 
reasons why they joined the group.
     Z-Fest: Lee Bradley reminded the group that he offered a $50 
honorarium for each keynote speaker. Bruce Morgen accepted the 
invitation with an additional request that Z-Fest pay for his motel 
room. It was pointed out that there was a $400 budget to pay for 
running Z-Fest and that it would set a precedent if we were to do this 
that would put a strain on the club budget. It was decided that the 
group could not honor this request. A suggestion was made that a 
collection could be taken up from those willing to lend a hand to help 
defray some of these costs. Lee Bradley then brought up the following 
proposals that had been voted on during the Executive meeting: 1. Have 
a two tier membership fee, $10 and $20. The $10 membership would get 
the "Smaller is Better" while the $20 or deluxe will also have a 
subscription to the Lee's "8 Bits & Change."
     Brian was concerned that CCP/M in its goal to become a national 
organization may not be abiding by current bylaws. He stated that "non- 
profit" may turn into "profit," there were arbitrary changes made in 
the by-laws in attempting to achieve a national status and the goals 
of the group should be clearly defined. [President's note: a review of 
the bylaws indicated no such conflict.] He also saw potential problems 
in maintaining a viable treasury, i.e, how monies would be spent or 
prorated when a number of the membership are out of state and cannot 
attend meetings to voice there respective opinions.
     President Jim Taylor voiced his opinion that CCP/M was on track 
and would face any problems if they arose. Other members of the group 
thought these potential problems had the necessary safeguards.
     The dues change schedule was approved by an 8-3 vote.
     It was also noted and accepted that any member who had paid their 
dues at the old rate by December 1, 1990, would be considered a 
"deluxe" member automatically.
     Also pertaining to the above dues, it was voted and unanimously 
accepted that current and future officers of CCP/M will not have to 
pay any dues during their terms of office, the "deluxe" membership 
applies.
     Al Hathway got the fun portion of the program started and the 
computers and modems got into action. [Comments by Lee Bradley: Al 
fired up ZDB (Z-DataBase) and attempted to discuss its features. The 
heavy business emphasis and sometimes heated discussion left us with 
insufficient time to do this software justice. At least three members 
have indicated planned programs and business meetings should be 
scheduled on different nights.]
     Attendance: Lee Bradley, Tom Mannion, Gary Stagliano, Carolyn 
Wyman, Stuart Holden, Bob Bates, Bob Conlon, Jim Taylor, Steve 
Dresser, Stephen Griswold, Reno Franconi, Rick Swenton, Gwen Robinson, 
Brian Nalewajek and two guests from the Seattle, Washington area, Biff 
Bueffel and Ludovic Hemelryck.

Reno Franconi, Secretary
