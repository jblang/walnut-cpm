
                 Future CCP/M Meeting Programs.

November 14, 1989 -- Rick Swenton will demonstrate the X-10 
Powerhouse system CP-280 computer interface and the CP/M program 
he wrote to control it.

The X-10 system permits lights and appliances to be remotely 
controlled by sending signals on the 110 volt household wiring.  
Manual and remote control units are available, including the CP- 
280 computer interface.  The computer interface is programmed by 
a host computer, and once programmed keeps a week long schedule 
of events.  These interfaces are available with IBM and Apple 
software only.  Rick has written a CP/M program that controls the 
interface.  I use the X-10 controller and Rick's program to turn 
on my electric blanket every night, and turn on outside house 
lights every day.

December 11, 1989 --  Z-System Aliases.  Z-System users will 
demonstrate favorite aliases used to automate tasks.  This is a 
repeat of a summer topic, although the aliases discussed will be 
new.

Future topics will include Mailing List Maintenance, a review and 
demonstration of the Z-System compatible BDS C Compiler and 
Public Domain software.
