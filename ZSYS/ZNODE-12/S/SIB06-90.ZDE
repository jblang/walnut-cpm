  The monthly meeting on April 10 found Stephen Griswold working on his DEC 
PDT11 with the help of newcomer Tom Mannion and Al Hathway working on a 
project with his SB180 and an 8" floppy. Lee Bradley opened the discussion 
up to general topics.

  Lee reminded the membership of the upcoming Trenton Computer Festival 
which would feature a CP/M and Z-System conference with notable authors and 
experts conducting various workshops. (Editor's Note: The now bimonthly 
"Pieces Of Eight" will give full coverage of Trenton, with Z-Team 
photographs, product and development news).

  Lee also proposed a change in the monthly newsletter. It was pointed out 
that composing the newsletter requires much time and that currently too few 
members contribute articles on a regular basis. He suggested we publish a 
newsletter every other month and on the off month mail a one page "Smaller 
Is Better" news bulletin (you are reading the premier issue of SIB now!) 
This letter would be a report of the previous CCP/M meeting and would be 
printed on a single 8 1/2 x 11 piece of paper. After discussing and 
explaining the matter, the above change was approved. (Editor's Note: I 
think you will like this change although at first you might feel you are 
getting half your "Pieces" taken away. With two months to collect, edit, 
etc., "Pieces" will become an even better periodical than it is now.  
Contributions continue to be welcome.)

  On another topic, Lee requested help from the membership for a patch 
program to change the default usage of Touch Tone dialing in the IMP we 
distribute. Bob Bates from Gales Ferry was having some difficulty using IMP 
(he currently can only Pulse dial). (Editor's note: IMPATCH.LBR was located 
and Bob is up and running now. It might interest you to hear that Stephen 
Griswold needed about 10 minutes, his Osborne and IMP245.LBR to figure out 
how to patch IMP with DDT ... )

  Tom Griffin joined CCP/M at the meeting. He is working on a robot 
controller. He is in the process of developing software for it and will be 
using what he learns as part of a Masters degree. Tom graduated from East 
Carolina State, North Carolina and is pursuing his graduate work at CCSU, 
New Britain where he is presently living. He is employed by Konica as a 
Technical Writer. Good luck, Tom.

  Tom Mannion also joined CCP/M at the meeting. Tom is employed by Hamilton 
Standard where he helps to develop software and hardware for control 
devices used in commercial and military aircraft. Tom and Al Hathway 
attended the University of Connecticut together in Torrington and enjoyed 
reminiscing about their school days.

  Al is planning to go on an interesting trip. He is going with a group on 
a cross country journey from Virginia all the way to Oregon and back. He is 
not driving, not taking a plane or train. He will travel on his bicycle, 
all the way. All I can say is "Wow!", Al.

  Here's who made it to the April meeting: Bob Bates (Gales Ferry), Jim 
Taylor (Newington), Gary Stagliano (Manchester), Reno Franconi 
(Wethersfield), Al Hathway (Northfield), Thomas Griffin (New Britain), 
Stuart Holden (Huntington), Stephen Griswold (Canton), Tom Mannion 
(Winsted), Lee Bradley (Newington).
