
                     Type 5 Utility Is Here!

     Dream On Associates has recently announced the Type 5 
Utility.

     A natural extension of Type 3 and Type 4 programs, Type 5 
programs are "hyper relocatable", fitting themselves in between 
Type 1, 3 and 4 resident code (which may now therefore be 
considered obsolete).

     Type 5's load into fragmented RAM by scanning the resident 
code to determine free memory.  A Type 5 file uses TSA "damage 
control" code (see below) to compute the CRC of its loaded 
fragments and if it is found to be damaged (by program loads 
following the original invocation) an attempt is made to reload 
into the current environment (after removal of the damaged code). 
If this fails, TSA (Top Secret Algorithm) reallocates resident 
code to make room for the new request.  Eventually, of course, 
TSA decides which Type 5 has to go and loads the new Type 5 into 
the released RAM.

     DRL (Dream On Relocatable) files may be generated with DOA's 
Public Domain Hyper Virtual Assembler.  TSA.ZRL, TSA.Z80 
assembled as a Type 4 program, must be loaded first.

     With Type 5, all Type 1-4 code (save TSA.ZRL) may now be 
considered obsolete.

     For further information, contact DOA directly.
