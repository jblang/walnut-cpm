   The set of Z3HELP libraries as distributed has one problem worth noting:

     I obtained 'memory overflow' messages in trying to read DU3.HLP, VLU.HLP
     and  VMENU.HLP  as  options  under  DU31.HLP,  VLU1.HLP  and VMENU1.HLP, 
     respectively (I only have a 64k system!).   The uncrunching routines  in 
     LBRHLP use up to 22k of buffer space,  leaving only 25k+ for files,  and 
     these files are larger than 25k.  I will have to look later into a work-
     around (file-splitting?) for this.   //12Dec88 -  VLU has now been split 
     into two separate files. -wat//  

  I will try to issue updates to  the LBRs  periodically,  probably  bundling
  them in something like Z3HELP02.LBR, Z3HELP03.LBR, etc.
