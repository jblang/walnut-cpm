
              Minutes of the CCP/M Meeting of August 14, 1990

        Next Meeting: September 11, 1990, Farmington Public Library

A small crowd of 15 attended our mid-summer meeting. The meeting started at 
6:30.

In attendance were: Lee Bradley, Steve Dresser, Stephen Griswold, John 
Kennedy, Tom Mannion, Mark Michelsen, Brian Nalewajek, Eric Palm, Rick 
Swenton, Bob Conlon, Gabor Szikla, Jim Taylor, Jonathan Taylor, Diane Thome 
and Tom Veile. Mark and Eric joined CCP/M. Welcome!

The first topic was the forthcoming Z-Fest. This will take place on October 
27, 1990 at the Hartford Graduate Center in Hartford, Connecticut. 3 rooms 
will be provided, some for exhibits, some for lectures. The estimated cost 
is $400 for mailing and other miscellaneous expenses. A number of Z-System 
experts have agreed to participate and some suppliers are sending exhibit 
material to be managed by local reps such as Lee, Bob, etc. [Editor's Note: 
Currently, we have commitments from Jay Sage of Z-Systems Associates, Ian 
Cottrell (PBBS development), and Don Johnson of Public Domain Software 
Copying Company. We are talking with Bruce Morgen (Z Team) and others.  
Vendor literature is coming in now as a result of a mailing of about 100 
pieces. Another mailing to user groups throughout the US which will contain 
several things including a copy of the Z Fest flier (see attached) is 
scheduled. CCP/M members are encouraged to come to Z Fest '90 (of course!) 
and to promote Z Fest '90 by calling people they think might be interested, 
making copies of the flier and posting it in libraries, computer stores 
etc. A special mailing on October 1 which will contain maps, hotels, 
agenda, and a complimentary and inaugural issue of Eight Bits And Change, 
the new Computer and Humor Magalog from Small Computer Support is in the 
works. End of Note.]

Hardware news: Bob Conlon of Conlon Associates mentioned he has an Altos 75 
Mb hard drive CP/M 86 system for about $500. Also Lee announced the 
availability of a functional Kaypro II for $200. There was some discussion 
by the group about buying the Altos (Tom Mannion has been threatening to 
start a BBS lately and seemed especially intrigued.) The fact that it was 
not an 8-bitter capable of running Z-System seemed to cool the interest 
level down a bit.

Brian Nalewajek suggested that the club should buy a system to support the 
club's data base including members and software. This suggestion was tabled 
to the next meeting.

Software projects: Lee is wrestling with a zip code sorting problem 
associated with a presorted mailing list data base application. Use of a 
Turbo Toolbox demo program as a base program for the mailing list is 
contemplated. The zip code routines are needed to determine if a piece in 
the bulk mailing is a Direct, type 3, State or Miscellaneous piece.  
[Editor's Note: PC File 80 was purchased in place of modifying the Toolbox 
demo and MBASIC programs were written to determine which "Post Office Code" 
to use for each record. The inaugural issue of Eight Bits And Change will 
include an article on the whole project. End of Note.]

Lee presented a suggestion for the club's newsletter. He has worked hard 
for the past two to three years on the club's newsletter. Now he intends to 
issue one on his own to make some money. He offered this bi-monthly 
product for the club's newsletter at a discount per capita charge. The 
final response to this offer was postponed until a copy of it has been 
presented. For now the members voted $50 to be paid to Lee for the 
first copy, whenever it is delivered.

[Final Editorial Note. I (this is Lee talking now) talked to Eric Palm last 
week and he has a video on the Desk Top Publishing software and hardware he 
uses and which will be used to prepare Eight Bits And Change. I will be 
bringing a TV set to the September meeting and we will show it to anyone 
that's interested. And of course, last but not least, Elections will be 
held at the September 11th meeting. Campaigning has been extremely heavy 
for all offices, especially the Treasurer position ... As a reminder, 
President: Jim (The Day Elvis Trashed My PC and Other Equally Outrageously 
Funny Pieces) Taylor, Secretary: Reno Franconi (going for an unprecedented 
2nd term,) Treasurer: Tom Veile, Lee Bradley and Gary Stagliano (Mr. C-128) 
(Tom is a founding member of CCP/M and has served faithfully for several 
years, Lee has just learned how to balance his checkbook and Gary runs Silk 
City Systems Services ... you decide ...,) Program Coordinator: Al (Biker) 
Hathway, Newsletter Editor: (not an elected position but worth mentioning 
anyway,) Diane Thome. See you there. End of Note.]

These notes were prepared by President Gabor Szikla, edited by Lee Bradley 
and shipped by the US Post Office on Thursday, September 6. When did YOU 
get them?
