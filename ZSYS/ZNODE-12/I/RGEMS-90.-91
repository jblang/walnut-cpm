Redactor's Note:

You may wonder what the (sm) stands for. Although it may reflect certain 
tendencies of Mr. Wright, in this case it simply means that the title "Rare 
Gems" is a service mark. As such, David is interested in making sure that 
he is the only one in a position to misuse it. He had his close friend 
Saddam send me a letter politely requesting, under pain of death, to insert 
a disclaimer for all to read and abide by. Now normally this wouldn't have 
much impact on me, but since the letter came attached to a six pack of beer 
and a canister of nerve gas, I decided that it might be worth including. So 
with tears forming in my eyes I humbly present the following for your 
reading ord... er, pleasure:

     Rare Gems (sm)' is a service mark (sm) of Rare Breed
     Noninc. and David Alan Wright.  This collection may be
     distributed freely, as long as this disclaimer is
     retained in its entirety.

Rare Gems(sm) December 1990 by David Wright

This is the December 1990 collection of Rare Gems (sm). It was compiled by

Compiler's Note:

After the last compilation of gems, I told David that I would do this for 
him once in a blue moon. Not thinking anything of it I signed a paper to 
that effect, after which David disappeared in a puff of smoke accompanied 
by the smell of brimstone. You'd think he'd never heard of Dr. Scholl. 
Well, it seems that New Years Eve was a blue moon, being the second full 
moon to occur in a month. So I now find myself in the awkward position of 
having to carry out this munda..., uhh, wonderful task. I'd better hurry as 
David is beginning to twitch his tail nervously. Here's hoping you'll have 
a devil of a good time reading this collection.

Redactor's Note:

This is it. I guess I have to come out of the closet. I'd rather you hear 
it from me than in some sleazy tabloid. Yes, the rumors are true. I am a 
Rare Gems junkie. (There I said it, Dave. So you don't have to send the 
photos to Geraldo.) At first it was a passing fancy, an occasional escape 
from the pressures of daily life. I told myself I wasn't like the others. I 
could control my passions. But soon the fancy turned into a craving even 
stronger than Gilligan's Island reruns. I had to have my daily fix, or I 
couldn't cope.  The days he missed were pure agony. Then the most horrible 
thing happened, they started to make sense. I knew I had hit bottom. I was 
so ashamed. (At this point I am sobbing great tears of shame.) I visited 
several clinics, but I was told my condition is hopeless. There is no known 
cure for what I have.  This has led me to the decision to share my misery 
and spread this awful addiction to others. Here's hoping you'll get hooked.

Redactor's Note:

It's a conspiracy, a conspiracy I tell you. A new religion is subtlety 
making its way into American homes. On the outside it appears harmless, but 
in reality it is a movement that will tear apart the very fabric of our 
society.  No one is safe from its influence. It is so dangerous that it 
makes the Illuminati seem like a fairy tale.

This vile abomination, called RareGemism, is the creation of one David 
Wright.  He has found the key to enslaving our minds and bringing the world 
into an age of chaos. He has discovered that anyone reading the following 
sentence is hopelessly under his nefarious control.

          "Bud is the lite of the world, and David
          Wright is his prophet."

Compiler's Notes:

David has asked me to provide some information about myself. He feels that 
it's important to understand that he has nothing whatsoever to do with this 
introductory note. I hope what is now revealed will satisfy any morbid 
curiosity.

I am a figmant of David's overactive imagination, existing at the very 
fringes of his consciousness. I am the other, the alter ego. Every month I 
emerge from some dark, damp recess of his mind(??) to do my mission of 
mercy. For it is I (yes, I alone) who twists and reforms his chaotic 
expressions into some semblence of order. He knows I exist but can do 
nothing to stop me. I am his personal devil, his worst nightmare come true. 
I exist only to torment him. I am Jeckyll to his Hyde, Schwartzkopf to his 
Hussein, Quayle to his Bush. He lives in dread of that day when I will gain 
a separate existence and reveal the awful secret that David is, in fact, a 
nice guy. For now, I am content to inhabit part of his psyche, the 
netherworld between dream and reality, and bring you this latest insight 
into David's bizarre and twisted mindset.

  Redactor's Note:
I'm shocked. You see, I never thought it could happen to me. I'm a real 
nice guy, and things like this just don't happen to nice guys. Yes, I had 
heard all the warnings, but thought it was only for the other guy. It was 
always someone else's problem, never mine. Yet, it happened, and now I am 
paying price for my reckless lifestyle. All it took was one time. I was 
caught up in the excitement and pleasure. I threw caution to the wind. In a 
matter of moments my life was changed forever. I can never go back to my 
old way of life. My family and friends, if they do not abandon me, will 
have to live with my stigma and shame. The black mark can never be erased. 
What happened? I was GEMmed. I had failed to practice safe computing and 
exposed myself to this insideous danger. Now I find myself in the same 
company as Mark Twain, Dan Quayle, and Unknown. Learn from my example 
before it's too late.  Don't become a victim of your own unbridled 
computing. Be safe, or you may end up like me -- a Rare Gem worthy of David 
Wright.

Redactor's Note:

My time grows short, dear reader. I don't know how much longer I can hold 
out.  It seems the world has turned against me in its attempt to avoid the 
truth.

At first I thought my work was accepted, but then I began to notice the 
furtive looks. People would whisper behind my back. Soon mothers began 
taking their children into the house. Friends would cross the street to 
avoid me.  Answering machines would hang up. But I endured it all for the 
sake of the mission.

I guess it was only a matter of time before the notes came, then the bricks 
and the firecrakers. I thought it was some sick prank, then I realized my 
friends, my so-called friends were racked with jealousy. I had a vision 
denied them, and so I pressed onward with my great task, obliviously to the 
growing sense of hatred for what I do.

As I write this the crowds have gathered again in front of the house as 
they have done so the past several nights. The light of the torches 
illuminate the fear and prejudice in their eyes. I hear the sound of the 
door being shattered, and the voices grow louder as they move through the 
house. I expect very shortly to be carried off and forced to listen to the 
best of Dan Quayle.  My time is short now, so I call upon you to be my 
judge. Is this living hell worth it? Read on and
