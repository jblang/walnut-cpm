        Future CCP/M Meeting Programs
                                              
January 9, 1990 --  No formal topic planned.  
"Free for all" meeting.  Bring your 
questions, answers, computers and friends!

Future topics will include Mailing List 
Maintenance, a review and demonstration of 
the Z-System compatible BDS C Compiler and 
Public Domain software.

The Connecticut CP/M Users' Group meets the 
second Tuesday of every month at the 
Farmington Public Library, Farmington, CT.  
6:30-9:00pm


                Meeting Notes
              December 12, 1989

We had almost as many computers as people at 
the meeting!  I think there were 3 Model 100 
Portables, a Royal, a Kaypro, an Osborne I 
and an SB180.  There was lots of milling 
around before an impromptu talk by Lee 
Bradley on some of his favorite aliases.  Al 
Hathway made a list of his aliases available 
as well as hard copy of ARUNZ documentation.

New member Gary Stagliano handed out a sheet 
on the Silk City BBS (203) 649-9057 which 
appears to be a unique service provided by 
the town of Manchester, CT.  Give it a call!

New member Bill Connolly was soaking in a 
demo of HOST.COM (software mentioned in the 
January issue of POE).  Bill and Lee have 
been teaching each other the ins and outs of 
MOVE-IT and IMP recently.

Brian Nalewajek got Z-Fest 2 on the agenda 
for the Spring of this year.  See elsewhere 
for a message left by him on our Remote 
Access System.  A sub-committee was appointed 
to organize and advertise.  Stay tuned!  Help 
out!

Prospective member Bill Cadiz owns a 
NorthStar Advantage computer and is looking 
for help getting a CP/M system disk for it.  
He doesn't know this yet but after the 
meeting I thought of Drexel Hill NorthStar Z- 
Node # 6 as a place to call.  Any help on 
this would be appreciated.

The aftermeeting drew only Gary Stagliano, 
Stephen Griswold, my wife and I!  Hope your 
holidays were great!  Here's who came:  Brian 
Nalewajek, Stephen Griswold, Gabor Szikla, 
Jim Taylor, Glen Gross, Al Hathway, Bill 
Connolly, Gary Stagliano, Bill Cadiz, Lee 
Bradley

  
               Z-Node List #57
              December 24, 1989
     Sorted by State/Area Code/Exchange

This list includes information about 
accessing the Z-Nodes using the two low-cost 
data services, PC-Pursuit (PCP) and StarLink 
(SL).  For nodes accessible by PCP, the city 
code and maximum data rate are given.  Where 
known, the SL code is given.  An asterisk 
with the code indicates that the call to the 
Z-Node may incur local toll charges.  If you 
know the SL code for any nodes that do not 
have a code listed, I would appreciate it if 
you would send me that information.

An "R" in the left column indicates a node 
that has registered with Z Systems 
Associates.  Report any changes or 
corrections in a message to Jay Sage on Z- 
Node Central (#2) or Z-Node #3 in Boston (or 
by mail to 1435 Centre St., Newton Centre, MA 
02159-2469).

     Mark Twain would surely say that Tim 
Parker's report of the "Death of the Hacker" 
(Computer Language, July 1989) is greatly 
exaggerated!  In fact, "dedicated, infinitely 
curious, talented systems programmers" still 
actively hack at least one operating system -- 
CP/M!  Parker notwithstanding, the emergence 
of the IBM PC did not halt CP/M system 
innovation, which continues at a strong pace, 
and without requiring megabytes of ram.

     Today's well-equipped CP/M system runs 
the "Z-System" -- version 3.4 of the ZCPR 
command processing environment.  It installs 
automatically on any Z-80 CP/M computer 
without assembly-language changes to the BIOS.
     
     The Z-System user interface includes 
command history; an error handler for 
catching abnormal terminations and editing 
previous command lines; a general-purpose 
script language for both command processor 
and application program input; conditional 
command execution; command aliases; named 
directories and password protection; menu and 
help subsystems; full-screen command shells; 
etc.  ZCPR34 adapts dynamically to memory 
requirements of applications.  And the same 
environment runs on both CP/M 2.2 and CP/M 
Plus Z80 systems.
     
     Closely related is a task-switching 
extension to CP/M 2.2 called BackGrounder ii. 
It provides full-screen windows for any two 
active CP/M programs, cut-and-paste 
capability between those tasks, output 
redirection, and pop-up desk accessories.

     The original BDOS from Digital Research 
has long since been overtaken by improved Z80 
versions.  The latest -- ZSDOS -- includes 
integrated datestamping and automatic path- 
searching.  File DateStamping, which has been 
available for five years, provides full UNIX 
capability -- create, modify, and access 
dates and times.
     
     Z-System tools and applications are 
developed by a community of programmers 
driven to share innovations and discoveries.  
This sense of purposeful, good-natured system 
hacking can be readily detected by logging 
into one of the Z-Node remote systems that 
provide their electronic meeting places.

     Perhaps in DOSland the true hacker is a 
dying breed, but CP/M system development 
thrives.  Tim Parker and others longing for 
the old challenge are most welcome to 
(re)join us and push the envelope further!

Subj: BDS C
From: Al Hathway  To: Lee Bradley
The BDS C arrived today ... a very impressive 
package.  Jay Sage is now handling 
distribution and support, and has collected 
the files into crunched libraries to reduce 
disk usage.  Included are the RED editor, and 
CDB, the C DeBugger.  The documentation makes 
no mention of Z-System support, but the third 
( of 3 ) diskettes is entirely Z-System.  ORG 
100 type 1 programs and type 3 programs are 
supported.  This is a very comprehensive 
package, but not for the faint hearted ...  
I've just skimmed the 200+ page manual, and 
am going have to go back and give it some 
detailed examination.  I did not see any 
quick, short descriptions on how to do it ... 
Hopefully, this will come off the project 
stack pretty soon ... I have a couple of C-80 
utilities I wrote,  and I am curious to see 
what BDS C does with them.  I also think I 
have C source code for the computer game 
COREWARS.  Keep you posted, Al.

Subj: Programming
From: Howard Goldstein  To: Lee Bradley
Well, most of the complexity and detail in 
those programs wasn't mine; I just fixed a 
few things.  In LBREXT27, most of what I did 
was to simplify the original.  Talk about 
complexity!  And with all that, a bug has 
shown up in LPUT17 when running under Z3PLUS. 
I've just finished LPUT18 and will upload it 
if somebody else hasn't beaten me to it.

Subj: BTW Lee.
From: Stephen Griswold  To: Lee Bradley
In Jan. POE, add a quick note listing the 
Portable 100 BBS (which Andy mentioned I 
forgot to put in the article), of:  (603)-924- 
9770. (300/1200).  Its name is the Portable 
100 PBBS, though it's running on I think the 
Beta-version of TBBS for the PC.

Subj: bbs: moebius
From: Andy Meyer  To: Jim Taylor
Okay Jim. I ran into Stephen on the Portable 
100 bbs.  I thought there was other stuff 
here, not to worry.  My bbs is called 
"moebius" (like the strip, small "m") and I 
run software called Citadel: 201-968-8235, 
1200 baud, 24 hrs daily.  Cheerio.

Subj: Cuckoo's Egg
From: Brian Nalewajek  To: All
The "Cuckoo's Egg" is the title of a book by 
Clifford Stoll; the subtitle is "Tracking A 
Spy Through The Maze Of Computer Espionage".  
The publisher is Doubleday.  I caught a taped 
interview of the author on CSPAN (yes some 
people do watch CSPAN).  While working at a 
non-classified computer complex in Berkley, 
the author noticed that his accounting for 
computer time expenses were off by $0.75.  He 
said if it had been a bigger discrepancy he 
would not have payed much attention; but why 
would the account be off by 75 cents?  The 
answer was that a computer spy working out of 
West Germany was tapping into the system just 
long enough to plant a tiny program that 
would increase the spy's access to the system 
to a super high level.  Stoll began tracing 
the guy's access and found he was using 
computer links thru TYMNET, a BBS, and a 
university to break into military computer 
nets to sell the goods to the Ruskiis.  He 
called the FBI but they scoffed when he told 
them his accounts were only off by 75 cents.  
Stoll was undaunted and the US and W. German 
governments caught and are prosecuting the 
spy now.  I plan to find a copy of the book 
myself; looks like it will be great reading 
for those interested in what can happen when 
one person pays attention to what's going on. 
The author seems like quite a character: a 
holdover from the Sixties;  not the kind of 
guy you'd expect to be safeguarding the 
nation from hightech espionage.  The book may 
be like the author -a bit out of the 
ordinary, even includes a recipe for 
chocolate chip cookies - but I think it may 
appeal to the out of the ordinary people that 
frequent this system.  BRN..  PS.  Cuckoos 
leave their eggs in other birds' nests for 
them to hatch and raise as their own.

Subj: Z-Fest 2
From: Brian Nalewajek  To: Lee Bradley
I'm sorry I couldn't make it to the 
aftermeeting meeting last night. (Please pass 
along my Holiday wishes to Linda). I had to 
give someone a ride later in the evening, and 
I didn't want to cut it close.  I hope the Z- 
Fest idea catches on.  Your BBS becoming a Z- 
Node should give us a big advantage over the 
last one (as far as contacts in the Z 
community are concerned).  It also adds a 
certain officiality to the affair.  I'll 
leave a msg to all here asking for names of 
people interested in helping to organize the 
event.  I think it would be best to use the 
term 'Spring of 90' as the working date until 
we narrow it down.  That gives us some 
flexability in selecting the exact date later 
on.  Perhaps we should not even mention a 
site location until we've had a chance to 
assess the scale of what we want to cover.  
I'm glad to see that your board has been so 
stable, even interruptions have been fixed 
very quickly.  That will help us alot in 
using the BBS as the clearing house for Z- 
Fest project information.  As soon as we an 
get a few more people in on the early 
planning stages, we can begin the decision 
process for date, site, size, etc.  At least 
this will start the ball rolling.  BRN ...  
PS.  When we get the other people to help 
out, it may help to set up a seperate section 
(folder) of the board just for the Z-Fest.

Subj: PBBS Problems
From: Ian Cottrell  To:  Lee Bradley
Glad that all is working fine now, Lee.  That 
PMNT function 8 can be very useful at times, 
but few sysops seem to understand its use.  
I'm working on a clock for my system, so that 
I don't have to set the time so often (I 
forget sometimes, too!).  The POE arrived 
yesterday.  I read it cover to cover before 
supper and enjoyed it very much.  After 
reading Rick's article about contributing to 
the newsletter, I've been thinking about 
doing a little article on PBBS.  If I can 
find the time, I'll send you a copy as soon 
as it's done.  Thanks again for the 
newsletter;  maybe I can get down your way 
someday and attend a meeting (I go down to 
Trenton, NJ each year for the Computer Faire; 
maybe we can work something out on the way 
through!).  TTYS ... Ian

Subj: Cuckoo's Egg
From: Andy Meyer  To:  Brian Nalewajek
I caught that interview too, and the guy's 
not all that weird if you have friends in the 
Berkeley area.  The reason he went off on 
tangents is because the "interviewer" (not 
much of one, if you ask me) allowed him to, 
and didn't ask any specific questions, 
probably because he didn't understand the 
topic.  It reminded me of the NightLine where 
Ted Koppel had Steve Wozniak on and a couple 
of other guys, and they were talking about 
"viruses".  In true uninformed media fashion, 
Ted asked "Well, suppose I had a virus.  
Could I break into a bank with it?".  Pul- 
eeze.  Ted also had lots of trouble keeping 
everyone on the topic when he didn't 
understand it himself.  The book does sound 
interesting, and I may eventually buy it, 
after I finish "Surely You're Joking, Mr.  
Feynmann!" (about the late Nobel laureate 
Richard Feynmann) and "The Real Frank Zappa 
Book".

Subj: FBI guy
From: Brian Nalewajek  To:  Jim Taylor
That must look real good on his resume'.  
BRN..

Subj: Stoll and Feynmann
From: Brian Nalewajek  To: Andy Meyer
Stoll is weird, and that's not a putdown.  I 
think he'd fit in fine on this BBS.  I agree, 
the interviewer was out of his depth.  I 
don't think that's uncommon either.  A lot of 
the news anchor people show the same grasp of 
subject material.  It's probably expecting 
too much to think that they could have a 
knowledge base as broad as the PR guys would 
like us to believe.  Feynmann was great.  I 
didn't read the title you mentioned but have 
read a couple of books by him.  Was the book 
you mentioned an autobiography or written by 
someone else?   BRN..

Subj: CC Cookies

Subj: Addictions
From: David Wright  To: Jim Taylor
Uno!  Pass!  Reverse!  Draw Two Cards!  Draw 
Four!  Green!  Red!  Yellow!  Blue!  More!  
More!  Hello, I'm Dave, and I'm an Uno 
addict.  I never thought I could get hooked, 
but it happened so slowly, so insidiously ... 
It began with Go Fish.  Go Fish was an ok 
game for ordinary cards, but it got dull 
fast.  Then someone introduced me to Crazy 
Eight.  I couldn't get enough of it!  I wore 
out many decks doing Eight, and the nerves of 
my friends when I kept bothering them to 
play.  They just couldn't understand.  This 
was during the days of generic, over-the- 
counter cards.  Everyone could get them, and 
they were no big thing.  It was inevitable 
that there would one day be a new twist on 
cards:  Designer Decks.  Uno was one of the 
first of the designer decks, and it didn't 
even need any gateway games to hook people.  
It didn't really affect most people, but I 
fell hard, really hard, because of my history 
with Fish and Eight.  I hate myself.  I'm so 
ashamed.  Want to play a game?  --:Dave

Subj: CCPM Newsletter
From: Jay Sage  To: Sysop
I was delighted to receive the newsletter and 
the formal application to be a Z-Node.  
Consider it done.  Congratulations, you are 
now Z-Node #12.  In the message of over a 
month ago to which I am now replying, you ask 
how I find the time for all this.  The answer 
is that I don't -- that is why it has been so 
long since the last call (and why it is now 
close to 2:30 am).  I particularly enjoyed 
reading Dave Barry's column, as I always do.  
My favorite is "The Board".  There is no 
copyright notice but also no statement in the 
newsletter about copying rights.  I would 
like to reprint the piece on electricity in 
the Boston Computer Society KUGEL newsletter. 
Would this be OK?  Do you have a computer- 
readable form of the article here on the 
system (or otherwise available)?  I'll call 
back in a day or two to see if you have an 
answer for me.  Thanks.

Subj: Aha! A Miracle?
From: Daryl Gehlbach  To: Jay Sage
In our last correspondence I had told you 
that I couldn't seem to get ZCPR3 working 
with the Trantor system on the Osborne I.  
You (and FOG) gave the impression that nobody 
else had done so.  I had the same frustration 
with Z2.  I couldn't get a workable CCP that 
Trantor liked. I rechecked the recipe I had 
received.  I realized that I was doing one 
thing different, that is using MLOAD when the 
instructions called for LOAD.  When I 
followed the recipe (this time using LOAD 
from DRI) I got a working Z2 CCP.  Well ... I 
still had the ZCPR3 source files on line, so 
I recompiled ZCPR3 (again using LOAD).  I 
developed what should have been the correct 
CCP for Trantor's purposes.  I reset the 
computer and booted with (a two floppy) 
ZCPR3.  I made sure that I loaded the 
segments into their proper places.  I 
executed WL (Westwind Loader).  To my 
surprise I got the named directory prompt 
(A0:BASE>) logged into the hard drive A.  I 
could do aliases, multiple commands, named 
directories, paths, wheel, etc.  I seem to 
have ZCPR3 and Trantor cooperating.  I spoke 
with Jack (from FOG).  He said that this is 
the furthest anyone to his knowledge has 
progressed.  He advised me to make sure how I 
did it, so I can pass it on.  He also 
suggested that I give the Z-System a real 
workout, put it through its paces.  In this 
way try to expose any hidden bugs.  Do you 
have any suggestions on how to do that?  The 
only files I altered were the Z3BASE and 
Z3HDR to configure the system.  I used MAC 
followed by DRI's LOAD.  Then used the 
proprietary program to make the required bit 
map, and installed the loader file as told to 
do.  I did make sure that my expected 
configuration of ZCPR3 was booted from my 
floppies, that all segments were loaded prior 
to invoking the Westwind Loader. I did not 
diddle with any code in the main file.  I'll 
type up a complete list of my steps and 
forward them to you and FOG.  Due to the 
holidays I probably won't have anything for 
you until after January 1st.  Peace.....

         Multitasking: The CCP/M Way
             by James F. Taylor

There is a lot of talk in the computer world 
these days about multitasking.  Users of the 
"other" systems look down upon devotees of 
small systems as being behind the times.

True multitasking, as described in current 
computer magazines, allows you to do several 
operations simultaneously. (Word processing, 
telecommunications and game playing, for 
instance.) However, the computers that do 
these wondrous things are incredibly 
expensive and quite difficult to justify for 
anything other than business.  Sure, we could 
go out and spend gigabucks on the latest 
technofix that guarantees us electro-nirvana. 
But what's the point?

As I write this, I'm also printing out the 
hardcopy to be used in the January club 
newsletter and playing a game of computer 
backgammon.  The interesting thing is that I 
*don't* own a multitasking computer.

How do I it, sports fans?  Simple.  I'm 
multitasking by using multiple computers.

My trusty Kaypro 4 chugs along happily, 
attached to its daisy wheel printer.  My PC 
patiently waits for my next move (playing 
games *IS* what the PC was invented for) and 
I'm writing this article on my "calculator," 
a Radio Shack Model 100 laptop.

(An aside to those interested, the damn PC 
just beat me in round 1: 32-zip.)  When the 
newsletter finishes printing, I'll transfer 
this article to the Kaypro for additional 
editing and spell checking with WordStar 4.0. 
From there it will go to paper for still more 
editing, and the corrections will be made 
with the Kaypro.

(Round two: score 38-6)

Once I'm satisfied that this piece is as good 
as it's going to get, off it goes, through 
the phone lines, to the Xerox BBS that hums 
ever so gently in a corner of Lee Bradley's 
den.

(Round 3: score 38-10)

If all meets with Lee's approval (and it's 
doubtful you're reading this if it hasn't) 
it'll be packed into a CP/M library file and 
either written to disk for hand delivery or 
sent back over the phone lines into my Kaypro 
and then out to my daisy wheel, which will 
chug along while I fight this infernal clone, 
thus completing the circle.

(Round 4: score 38-12)

Hey, don't get me wrong.  I'd love a 386 
laptop and a 486 desk-top computer to play 
with.  Christmas is coming up and so is my 
birthday.  I'll be happy to send my mailing 
address to any of you who want to play Santa 
for me.

(Round 5: score 38-20)

Let's get real.

(Round 6: score 54-20)

My setup, except for the PC (which you could 
buy cheaply if you didn't get all the bells 
and whistles I did), cost about 500 bucks.  
With it I can "multitask" to my heart's 
content.  I can compute at the park or the 
beach, format disks in any number of sizes 
and shapes and use more software than I can 
afford.  Not to mention doing my own work 
while my son plays "Reader Rabbit".

(Round 7: score 55-20)

So all-in-all, I think I've got the best of 
all possible worlds.  I can have my cake and 
eat it too.  And it hasn't cost me the 
equivalent of the national debt to get it.

Give it some thought.  Do you want to run 
with the pack or follow a different drummer?  
Either buy a multitasking computer or become 
a multitasking computerist.

The choice is yours.

(Round 8: score 61-20, game called because of 
operator aggravation.)
