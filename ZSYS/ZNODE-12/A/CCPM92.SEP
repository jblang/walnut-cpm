                              September 1992
                    By Sigurd Kimpel, Acting Secretary

The meeting was called to order by President Al Hathway at 7:32 PM. The 
following members were present: Al Hathway, Randy Edgett, Tom Veile, Diane 
Thome, Sigurd Kimpel and Stephen Griswold (Stephen arrived late).

We discussed the club's bylaws (did we, or did we not have a quorum?). In 
as much as no one could show otherwise, we assumed that the attendees did 
constitute a quorum and proceded with the main topic of business which was 
the election of officers. The acting Secretary was directed to cast a 
single ballot for the following officers who were nominated at the August 
meeting:

President:  Al Hathway
Treasurer:  Tom Mannion
Secretary:  Gary J. Stagliano

The "Program Planner" office remains open and a search for someone to fill 
that position will continue.

There was no Treasurer's report, but the assumption was that we are nearly 
as solvent now as we were a month or so ago.

General Discussion:

The usual discussion on the "long term future" of the club ensued.  
Actually, the discussion centered around the amount of pizza and beer that 
could be purchased if we liquidated the club. The general consensus was 
that we could buy enough pizza and beer to cause our cholesterol to rise 
significantly and to threaten our safe arrival at home if we tried to 
liquidate the assets in a single session. Assumming that the pizza and beer 
were purchased at multiple "club meetings" (to stay within Connecticut's 
standards for blood/alcohol ratios and public decency), we might go 5 or 6 
months before exhausting the treasury (possibly a lot less when word gets 
out!)

The discussion then degraded to MS-DOS bashing and the club communications 
media (Smaller is Better! and the club BBS run by Lee Bradley). Tom Veile 
discussed the procedures he follows for generation of Smaller is Better!  
and reminded us that the deadline for submittals is about 1 week after the 
monthly meeting.

Technical Stuff:

Al Hathway had a neat laptop that was running the MYZ80 CP/M 2.2 simulation 
and NZCOM. Al received the disk in the mail from Lee Bradley a day or so 
earlier and he did not have time to thoroughly check it out, but his 
initial reaction is that MYZ80 simulation works, is reasonably complete and 
is relatively fast (Al was running a 386SX). The MYZ80 simulation sets up 8 
megabyte virtual disks for drives A, B and C and a 1 megabyte RAMDISK for 
drive D. Al promised to give a more detailed report on the MYZ80 simulation 
next month. If you are thinking of trying MYZ80, you may want to get an 
MS-DOS program that is capable of reading CP/M formatted floppies. The 
program 22DISK is a public domain program that members may download from 
Lee Bradley's board (203) 665-1100.

(Side note:) This writer has tried to run the MYZ80 CPM3 simulation, 
without success. To run the MYZ80 simulation, you must import CCP.COM from 
a licensed system (my CCP.COM came from a C128). If someone out there has 
better luck than I did, please let me know exactly what you did. See me at 
the next club meeting (or call me collect at 413-443-4397).

Tom Veile briefly discussed LORAN, the radio location and ranging system 
that aircraft can use to locate their position. LORAN displays the aircraft 
position (latitude and longitude) based on the differential arrival times 
of signals from multiple fixed ground stations. Tom promised to give us a 
LORAN tutorial at the November meeting.

My thanks to Diane Thome, who brought in the Kaypro 4 which I am using to 
type these minutes.
