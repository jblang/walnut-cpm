          Connecticut CP/M Users' Group
          October/November Meeting Notes

Al Hathway introduced the capabilities of the new 
Z System at our October meeting.  I think a good 
idea would be to follow up with another meeting 
which shows how the new Z System can be packaged 
to provide the non-technical user with a menu 
driven front end to typical applications.  I've 
been asked by the YOU group to talk about NZCOM at 
their next regular meeting.  I went to their last 
meeting which was a very informal help session for 
Royal owners and got a chance to show off a few 
things I've been developing on my Royal under the 
new Z System (NZ-COM).  If you want to learn more 
about what it can do for you, come to the November 
meeting of YOUr Computer Users' Group.  Third 
Tuesday.  Not sure where it'll be so won't mislead 
you with any guess I might make.

Our first newsletter under the leadership of Jim 
Taylor and Mort Fabricant is history.  And despite 
a few problems, the final product was a good one.  
It was on time, interesting and full of 
challenges, news and other interesting material.  
I hear from Bruce Richardson and Mort that a laser 
printer may be used to print future newsletters.  
Bob Conlon, TCC president, has mentioned that his 
company is interested in providing copy services 
and in general in providing meeting space, etc.  
etc.  He mentioned at our meeting (which was more 
like a YOU-TCC-CCP/M joint meeting the more I 
think of it) that his group is planning a 
mega-meeting for Nov. 2 (first Wednesday) at which 
GEnie, CompuServe, Quantum Link and other 
electronic services will be called. Again, 
location was not definite (Red Cross was not 
available).  I expect by the time this goes to 
print, these details will have been worked out.

Tom Veile, CCP/M Treasurer reports that CCP/M's 
coffers hold $874.91.  New President Brian 
Nalewajek moderated the business end of the 
meeting.  The Bylaws were ammended slightly; 
Article 5, Section A is no longer, which simply 
means CCP/M is not obligated to jointly publish a 
newsletter with YOU.  Independent mailings and 
newsletters are now a possibility.

Al Hathway talked briefly about upcoming meeting 
topics.  Spreadsheets, Turbo Pascal, Home 
Controllers, Tutorial Sessions for the 
non-technical, more on the new Z System were some 
of the possibilities.   Glen Gross, our new 
Publicist, plans on contacting CCS and other media 
to begin to let others know what we are planning.  
Let Glen know how you think CCP/M can market 
itself.  Stuart Holden, our harcopy librarian, has 
provided us with two 5 meg hard disks plus an 
Ampro Little Board.  I have given the hard disk 
software to Al for reformatting and will be 
working on bringing up a new BBS on this machine 
in the coming weeks.  I got a note from a friend 
the other day which mentioned his failure to hook 
into my BBS.  I expect many people have been upset 
that 665-1100 is down.  I spent all day last 
Saturday bringing up BYE5, PBBS4 and ZCPR33 on my 
ON!  It ALMOST works but seems to not know what I 
mean when I use the system locally after it has 
answered a remote call.  For example, B: <cr> is 
not understood as a valid command.  Also, 
somewhere along the way, the RCP command CLS gets 
clobbered.  So, there are still some bugs.

For those of you out there waiting for the go 
ahead and official word on how you can order Z 
System software at 25% off, Brian has sent the 
application for CCP/M dealer status to Jay Sage, 
who with Tony Parker has established a new company 
called Z System Associates.  If you have ordered 
NZ-COM from Alpha Systems,  Joe Wright WILL be 
sending it to you.  But Joe is apparently busy 
writing and has been directing requests for Z-Plan 
purchases to Jay and Tony.  As soon as we get the 
paper work from them, we'll let you know how to 
place the order.  Bug Joe if you haven't heard 
about your order.  I know it usually takes me a 
few calls to get a job done.  Speaking of Alpha 
Systems, I got my first complimentary issue of The 
Z-Letter, Alpha Systems Corp.'s newsletter.  It is 
excellent.  Subscription rate is $25/year.  It 
will be a monthly newsletter.  First issue was 31 
pages long.  Editor David A. J. McGlone has 
produced a fine first issue.  The Z-Letter talks 
about Alpha Systems products, the fact that 
Echelon is now gone, article submission, product 
news and many other things.  It comes packaged as 
a pamplet and is obviously the work of a 
professional.  Editor McGlone contributed WRITING 
ABOUT WRITING.  Pages 25 thru 31.  He promises an 
article about the MagicSeries from Computer 
EdiType Systems next issue.

Skip Ferry defined himself as an "Osborne/Actrix 
owner and a seeker of knowledge and old donated 
computers".  Skip heads up an organization that 
helps people in many ways.  I don't know as much 
as I want to about this organization.  I do know 
it provides meals for the needy and computers for 
the curious.  How 'bout an article Skip?

Ray Gentle, FOG librarian of YOU and CCP/M member, 
spoke briefly about the FOG software libraries.  
There are two libraries, one MSDOS, one CP/M.  VDE 
for example has been implemented on MSDOS based 
systems by author Erik Meyer and the software is 
on one of the FOG MSDOS disks.  Check with Ray or 
Mort Fabricant if you would like a copy.  I gave 
Ray one of the power cables Richard Steadman, 
CCP/M software librarian, made to connect Royal F1 
and F2 drives. He will be performing a little 
surgery on it so it will work (Richard made a 
male-male cable, which worked fine when you are 
connecting an F1 and a converted F1 but doesn't 
work when you're connecting an F1 and an F2).  
Since giving him the cable, I have managed to 
avoid the issue of proper Molex connectors by 
cutting off the Molex plug at the drive end, 
cutting the improperly Molexed cable and soldering 
the wires together.  I now have two working F2's.  
And at least three people want F2's.  I have an F1 
which is probably convertable to an F2 (and which 
therefore could probably use the cable I gave to 
Ray, unaltered ...)  Anyway, I'll pull out 
Steadman's article on F1 to F2 conversion see if I 
can create a 3rd F2.  The Royal drive drought 
continues.  Royal Product Support in Manchester 
never answered my calls.  I suppose I should try 
at least one more time.

Howard Goldstein, CCP/M member and close friend of 
Jay Sage, tells me that PCPursuit now has a node 
in Hartford.  CTHAR.  You use some Telenet 800 
number.  I don't know too much about PCPursuit.  
All I know is that it costs $25/month, you can use 
it from 6 PM to 7 AM weekdays and weekends.  It 
doesn't sound like something the average person 
needs but it is a must for serious SYSOPs (like 
Rick Swenton, who subscribes).  Brian Nalewajek 
has mentioned that there is a similar system 
starting up here in Connecticut.  Again, I don't 
know the details but it works like PCPursuit, 
except is cheaper and applies only to Connecticut.  
Somebody out there, get us the details.

Rick Swenton is beta testing PBBS41B I believe.  
Ian Cottrell, who documented PBBS40, has been 
calling in periodically to see how it's going!

Lastly, I hope you all are ready for the cold 
weather, are doing fine and continue to keep in 
touch with the 8-bit world thru our club meetings, 
our newsletter and personal visits and phone 
calls.  There's always SOMETHING new and 
interesting to learn and to develop thru CCP/M.  
See you on the second Tuesday at the Farmington 
Public Library.  November the 8th.  Actually, this 
next meeting I promise I WON'T make;  I'm 
attending a class called "How To Start Your Own 
Business".  It did not meet on our October meeting 
date so I was able to make it after all.  I think 
Al is planning a meeting on Spreadsheets.  Mort 
Fabricant asked me if it would be possible to have 
CCP/M meetings announced 3 months in advance.  
Don't see why not.  Here are the dates anyway.

 CCP/M Meeting Dates and Topics (Very Tentative)

November 8th;  Spreadsheets?  Bookkeeping 
Software?  This topic has been requested and I 
think is what is planned.  Farmington Public 
Library  6:30

December 13th; Possibly a joint meeting on Z80MU 
(runs CP/M on an IBM computer).  Time Place and 
Topic still flexible.

January 10th; Non-Computerized Snowmen, Their 
Construction And Use.  In other words, I have no 
idea what is going to happen or where.  The only 
thing I know with some degree of certainty is that 
we're scheduled for this date to have a meeting.  
Actually, I think it would be great to be buried 
in a great big snowstorm and to all get outside 
and build a huge Snowman.  You know, there is life 
without computers.

Lee Bradley, Secretary, CCP/M, 10/22/88 at 9:20 PM.
