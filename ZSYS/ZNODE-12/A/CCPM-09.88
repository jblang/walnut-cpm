
This is a special mailing from the Connecticut CP/M Users' Group.  It 
contains a fair amount of material!  One of the most important things 
it contains is an application for membership renewal.  Our Group 
cannot survive unless once a year you take the time to dig deep and 
send in your $15 to cover the costs of its operation.  I apologize for 
the lateness of this mailing (if I get this in the mail tomorrow 
morning there's a slight chance you'll get it Tuesday, just in time 
for you to change your plans and come to the monthly second Tuesday 
(September 13th) meeting which will be back at the Farmington Public 
Library - 6:30 PM to 9:00 PM.)

Sorry about that.  This may be late, but it may be worth the wait.  
Last meeting in August was pretty well attended.  Mostly we decided 
upon a slate of officers.  I still have to call one of the 
Presidential nominees to see if he would like to run.  I put things 
off alot these days.  But I will try and reach him and on Tuesday we 
can vote our new leaders in.  Tom Veile has graciously agreed to stay 
on as Treasurer.  Richard Steadman wants to be the new Software 
Librarian.  I'll continue to record monthly meeting notes in the 
Newsletter as Secretary.  Brian Richard Nalewajek has agreed to be 
available as a Presidential nominee.  Glen Gross is the fellow I 
haven't called yet although we have talked a bit in the past about his 
interest in being President.  Hope he can find the time to be our 
President.  I think he would be excellent.  I think Brian would be 
excellent too.  Jim Taylor will be running for Newsletter Editor.  Al 
Hathway will be our (finally someone actually offered to take this 
important position!) Program Co-Ordinator.  1988-89 is shaping up to 
be a very interesting year indeed!

There's an application for NZ-COM (Z3-PLUS) inside.  I am mailing Joe 
Wright the application a User Group may fill out which will allow us 
to become a dealer for his products.  You will save approximately $19 
by buying the new Z-System thru us.  I am running NZCOM on my Royal 
and will be demonstrating it at some future meeting.  This is very 
important software and I strongly urge you to fill out your order and 
send it to Joe.  We still need our User Group Z-PLAN number but I 
think Joe will honor your order now if you send it.  I thought it was 
too important to delay releasing this form.  In fact, you might want 
to read what I've written on our application to him for Dealer status.

Here's an index for what's inside.  Remember, the KEY THING TO DO is 
to FILL OUT YOUR APPLICATION FOR RENEWAL and send it in.  Yes, I hate 
to say it, but this will be YOUR LAST NEWSLETTER unless you renew.  
I've finally entered all our names into my little home grown database 
manager (DATA211B.BAS) and you can find your name on one of the pages 
inside which shows all 66 members.  (We mail to several people on a 
complimentary basis.  Only Karlynn Carrington's name is included on 
the enclosed mailing list label pages (just got a letter from her 
telling us she's moving to Washington state).  Jay Sage, Joe Wright, 
Marc Warren, BPMUG, TCC, Wayne Masters, Steven Greenburg, FOG, TCJ, 
and others will be sent this mailing and will be added to our 
complimentary list.  If you know someone you think would benefit from 
our news, let us know.)

1.  CCP/M Membership Application Form
2.  CCP/M General Information Fact Sheet
3.  CCP/M Member List (ie. Us!)
4.  ZELLER.PAS, a Pascal program which tells you what day any date    
    falls on.
5.  SLR Systems product brochure.  Best assembler/linker around.
6.  The Computer Journal.  The HOW TO magazine.  Order Form enclosed.
7.  Product Announcement from IBM.  (You've probably seen this before 
    but in case you missed it ... )   
8.  The Recursive Universe.  A book about LIFE.  Reprint of book 
    jacket.  (We have several LIFE programs in the library.  Listings 
    available at the meeting.  BDSLIFE.C by Leor Zolman.  FASTLIFE.Z80 by  
    Jim Petersen.
9.  Something Jim Taylor slipped into my hand at the last meeting.  A 
    structured brainstorm on how we might procede with our group.  He I'm 
    sure had no idea I'd publish it and I hope he does not mind.  We need 
    to define ourselves more clearly and this I think is a good start.  
10. IBM-COMPATIBLE definition.  And more.
11. A poem by Robert Frost. 
12. Z-PLAN application forms.  Thanks go to Rick Swenton for sending 
    us hard copy of this User Group dealer opportunity.  
13. Some intriguing mathematical problems.  A CCP/M T-Shirt goes to 
    anyone solving all three problems.  Send your solution to CCP/M at the  
    address given on the CCP/M membership application form.
14. AMPRO Computers, Inc.  Spec sheet of their Little Board/PLUS 
    computer.  (Al Hathway is considering building an inexpensive 
    Z-System based computer and using the Little Board/Plus as its CPU.  I 
    am also considering setting up a BBS which would use the Little Board.  
    Rick Swenton owns one.  Joe Wright built NZCOM on one.  Thought you 
    might want to see something on it.


Well that's about it for now.  I'm off to work.  Then off to the YOU 
Picnic.  It'll be good to see the YOU gang.  Weather looks promising.  
(Unlike last year!!!).  Hope you were there!
