Maximum Leader Al Hathway called the meeting to order and asked for the 
reports from the officers. The Secretary's notes were blessed. The 
Treasurer's report included the bottom line of $750.53. Newsletter Editor 
Tom Veile has been given recently to hoarding bills to CCP/M and when he 
gives them to Treasurer Tom Mannion, the Club may very well go down the 
proverbial Chapter 11 tube, but, as long as he keeps them, we're fiscally 
fine.

Steve Dresser, Al Hathway, M* Dalene, Diane Thome, Tom Mannion, Eric Palm, 
Stephen Griswold, Lee Bradley were present and accounted for.

Trenton '93 will be April 17-18 this year. Al Hathway expressed interest in 
helping organize the CP/M conference(s) and Banquet. Start gathering your 
used equipment, your checkbook and gas up your truck. You've got less than 
two months to T-Day.

David McGlone sent out The Z-Letter #23 recently to subscribers. He has 
moved to Eugene, Oregon. Chris McEwen has indicated interest in publishing 
The Z-Letter and I believe the next issue will be done on his press. The Z- 
Letter costs $18/year and may be ordered from Lamda Software Publishing, 
149 West Hilliard Lane, Eugene, OR 97404-3057. Support David's efforts and 
send him a check. The Z-Letter is excellent.

Al Hathway talked about the great deals you can get at computer shows. He's 
recently picked up an RS-232 switch, some floppies etc. at very low prices. 
Typically, it costs about $7 to get in. Keep your eye out for announcements 
of these shows in the paper.

Stephen Griswold has recently equipped the BBS with ZMODEM protocol 
capability. He tried to demonstrate it but the board was down. The board 
has been failing recently and we have not figured out what the problem is. 
A local operator must be present and must hit R to Retry the disk access 
when the system crashes.

Al Hathway gave a brief history of modem protocols. With packet switched 
networks and their overhead, efficient protocols have become important. The 
original 128 byte packet (Xmodem Christensen) evolved into 1k block 
protocols. Much later, Chuck Forsberg developed the HMODEM program (for 
Heath). This eventually become known as ZMODEM protocol. ZMODEM features 
dynamic data sizing and is 95% efficient. 1k block transfer is 80% 
efficient. This translates to a 1 1/2 minute savings for a 10 minute 
transfer.

Stephen got RZMP and ZMP from Ian Cottrell's board. Hal Bower has written 
an SB180 overlay. RZMP and ZMP were written by Ron Murray. There is a large 
collection of overlays for different CP/M machines.

Among the features making ZMODEM attractive, Tom Mannion and others 
mentioned crash recovery (an aborted transfer can be resumed from cut off 
point on a second call). Also, ZMODEM is well-suited to the latest modems 
which support MNP4 and MNP5. Tom Mannion said MNP5 (the one which does 
compression) and ZMODEM are capable of 280 characters per second (not sure 
what baud rate this applies to.)

Finally, ZMP uses overlays. If you want to get ZMODEM going on your CP/M 
computer, CCP/M has at least 4 people that have experience in preparing the 
software for different machines.

If you are running an IBM type computer, an external protocol which hooks 
into ProComm (and I'm sure other communication programs) and which does 
ZMODEM transfers is available. It's called DSZ and may be found in the 
archive Z-EASY.ZIP.

Lee Bradley, 2/23/93.

These notes were written on a 486DX2/50 under Myz80 and Z-System using ZDE 
version 1.6. Just in case you're interested. The SIEVE12 benchmark on this 
machine takes about 5 seconds. It takes 39 or so on my 4 mHz Royal. I've 
got ZSDOS, DateStamper and NZCOM running. I have 7 megabytes left on my B: 
drive. About the same left on my A: drive. I'm in trouble on my C: drive; 
only 6 megabytes left. Of course, there's always the D: drive for those 
times when you need a few more k. It has 1 meg.

I would like to personally thank Newletter Editor Tom Veile for the job he 
is doing on SIB. Tell him you love him by sending material! He takes 
floppies, hard-copy, crayoned code on business cards, holographic images, 
virtual vaporware. Anything. The only requirement is that it be emulatable 
on a KIM-1 (or compat.). Tom Veile's address is: Tom Veile, 26 Slater Ave., 
Norwich, CT 06360

Speaking of 486's, the first thing I did (well, the 2nd thing, the first 
thing I did was send the hard disk back for a replacement hard disk) was 
remove the line in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file that ran Windows 3.1. The only 
thing I've figured out how to do under Windows is exit from it. This you do 
by typing Alt F X. See elsewhere for Windows Tag Lines that Stephen 
Griswold, Tom Mannion, Howard Goldstein, Daryl Gehlbach and others have 
collected.
