                                 May 1992

     This may be brief, as it is May 30th and I'm reading from notes 
written on the 12th ...

     Al Hathway put the agenda on the white board. Items: Secretary's 
report, Treasurer's report, NY Times windfall and the YASBEC.

     The Secretary's report was accepted as published in the last SIB. The 
Treasurer's report was accepted as well. We have over $500 in the account.  
I did not record the exact amount.

     The article in the NY Times on our group generated a fair amount of 
feedback. Mostly calls from people who wanted to give us their CP/M 
equipment. Arlene Jones gave us a Kaypro, Mac Macarty gave us a North Star 
Horizon, a dual 8" floppy drive, a Kaypro, software and manuals. A 
discussion of CCP/M's policy regarding donations followed. We decided:

     1. members of CCP/M will get first dibs on any donations. Tom Mannion 
later suggested members who take donations should consider donating 
something to CCP/M's treasury.

     2. since equipment donated might need refurbishing, CCP/M should 
compensate the person who works on the equipment.

     3. an inventory of what we have received will be kept. Tom Mannion has 
already started doing this.

     4. letters which thank those people who give us equipment will be sent 
out. No money values will be claimed for any donations.

     5. a flea market or donations of what we get to church groups, inner 
city kids etc. were suggested as possible ways to make what we get 
available to others.

     Gary Stagliano offered to take on the Secretary's position as our 
current Secretary is not making it to meetings.

     Stephen Griswold and Randy Edgett talked about difficulties they were 
having getting parts for the YASBEC. Newark Electronics "lost" Stephen's 
last order. The hardest part to find is the floppy controller (a 1772.)  
National will get back to Randy on this.

Those who came: Sigurd Kimpel, Randy Edgett, Tom Mannion, Diane Thome, Lee 
Bradley, Al Hathway, Ray Brown, Steve Dresser, Nicholas Stagliano and his 
proud father and mother, Gary and Ann Stagliano.

Lee Bradley, acting Secretary
