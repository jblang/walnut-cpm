
      CCP/M Meeting Notes, July-August 1988

The summer is at its mid-point and it's time to 
think about our organization...

I'll be reserving the Newington Public Library for 
the second Tuesday of August, August 9th, from 
6:00 to 9:00 PM.  If you want to be part of this 
general planning meeting, put this date on your 
calendar.

With summer comes a traditionally lower profile 
for computer clubs.  CCP/M skipped a meeting  in 
July.  It was a needed break, giving us a chance 
to enjoy the summer and think about things other 
than computers.

I've been working on a few things these last few 
weeks.  I've read a book called "CHAOS" and  have 
made the first move toward forming a consulting 
business (two hopefully unrelated activities...) 
"CHAOS", by James Gleick, is about "fractals" and 
"self-similar" phenomena and is a fascinating and 
readable book.  Weather, economic systems, 
coastlines and countless other things are shown to 
be governed by common rules.  The business is 
still in a formative stage but will involve 
consulting and training materials (video, 
floppies, manuals, courseware etc.) for small 
computer users (8 bit of course).

Richard Steadman has the CCP/M PD software library 
disks.  He'll be copying them to Royal formatted 
floppies.  Or will be trying to anyway.  The 
Kaypro he's got is failing regularly despite two 
visits to Warren Labs.  Very frustrating indeed.  
Richard's got a couple of ideas on how to track 
down what's wrong.  Will be asking Jeff Moore to 
take a look at it in a week or so if Richard has 
no luck.  We've got MEX running on the Royal.  New 
CCP/M member Dr. Charles Battista of Buffalo, NY 
called me and wanted to know what CCP/M was all 
about.  I sent him a "starter kit" and he sent us 
MEX.  This is Ron Fowler's Modem EXective program 
and is preferred by many over IMP.  The overlay 
used was adapted from M7DA-1.ASM, a MODEM7 overlay 
and as such needs "MEX"ifying.  YOU President 
Daryl Gehlbach will be looking at this.

Daryl visited me recently and we tried to install 
WordStar 4 on the Royal.  We did not succeed but I 
learned quite a few things about WordStar 4 in the 
process.  An ongoing effort will be conducted on 
line on the bulletin board to solve this problem.  
As soon as I get a chance I'll put up the file we 
created called SETTINGS which contains all the 
settings we currently have installed and based on 
them, the PATCH.LST file etc. etc. we'll lick this 
one yet.  As Daryl suggests, a FOG article on this 
would be real nice.  (The Mouse House is limping 
along on a Kaypro II with 2 191k floppies now; 
still adequate for messaging and small file 
transfer, but nothing like the hard disk Z system 
which is down for repairs (that's two computers I 
own that don't boot...))

Daryl and I discussed the Newsletter as well.  He 
indicated to me that Walt will not be co-editing 
in 88-89 by choice.  This leaves the CCP/M YOU 
Newsletter editor(s) position open.  This will be 
one of the many jobs that will need to be filled 
in the near future by our organizations.  Daryl 
and Jim Taylor have both indicated to me that they 
have some interest in helping out in this capacity 
but we need to firm this up.  Daryl mentioned the 
need for a consistent newsletter, one with monthly 
columns you can count on.  As contrasted with 
recent issues which, though interesting perhaps, 
were somewhat unpredictable in content  (for which 
you may thank/blame me in part!)  Timely and 
focused and brief.  I believe that what's needed.

Rick Swenton has offered to speak at a future 
CCP/M meeting on a topic of our chosing.  As has 
Glen Gross.  Let's talk about elected officers, 
the future/demise of CCP/M etc. etc. in August and 
then move on/over after that.

I have indicated I will not run for President in 
88-89.  This is not to say I won't work for the 
group and be quite active.  I would however like 
to take a more supportive role for the coming year 
and see others take the leadership position.  It's 
really not that much work.  Give yourself a chance 
to edit a newsletter, call a meeting, etc.  See 
you at 6:00 August 9th at the planning meeting.

PS.  Royal Product Support has made available to 
CCP/M 3 drives.  They continue to promise 3 to 5 
complete systems for a low price.  They also do 
not return my phone calls.  New members (or soon 
to be) Ruth Gorneault and Evelyn Straub have 
expressed an interest in owning the second drive.  
I will arrange that they get same in the coming 
week.  Richard Steadman did the conversion and 
cable work on these drives and for this CCP/M is 
very grateful.

Lee Bradley, President, CCP/M
