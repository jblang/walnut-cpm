
          CCP/M Meeting Notes - 11/29/87

Only  1 day overdue.  Not too bad.  Z-Fest on  the 
horizon. Let's see. Where to start?

I'm writing this on a Royal. This Royal is running 
CP/M  2.2.  It's showing me yellow letters.  Which 
makes  this the first (and only  ?)  color-capable 
CP/M  machine that I know of.  Isn't it great that 
in  1987,   a  full  12  years  since  the   first 
commercial  version  of  CP/M,  new  products  are 
coming out that run under it?

And let me tell you. This little baby ain't no toy 
computer.  It may not run Z (yet...) but it does a 
few things Kaypro never tried... I'm going to save 
the  details for a future article,  'cause there's 
news  to  tell besides this and  the  deadline  is 
already history.

Here's  my December list.  Not my Christmas  list. 
Speaking of XMAS, check out "Twas the Night Before 
XMAS" elsewhere.  Compliments  of  GEnie  guru  J. 
Taylor,  whose  upload stats at Mouse House belong 
in  Ripley's.  Also,  an original piece  on  GEnie 
itself in "Accessing the Lamp".  Jim even gives me 
GEniegrams to convince me of the GEnie service. We 
are  all  indirectly GEnie users because  probably 
well over 50% of the material he has put up on  my 
system was downloaded from there.

But  I  digress.   The  list.  Z-Festival  on  the 
Horizon,    Making   Boards,    Membership   drops 
(ALOT...),  UNIFORM  on the IBM PC and Royal  etc. 
computers,  ON!ward  and Upward or Waiting for  my 
7th  computer,  No meeting on the second  Tuesday, 
Easter   in   Mouse  and  dBase   etc.,   personal 
WORDprocessor  for the Commodore 64  owner,  CCP/M 
catalog  has  3668  files  on  103  disks,  Recent 
Uploads, and as they say, Much, Much more...

The  last meeting of CCP/M went well  despite  the 
many counts against it.  The weather was bad,  the 
newsletter  was  not  on  time so  some  may  have 
thought  it  was not going to be a  meeting  night 
plus our main speaker fell ill and was not able to 
make it. In way, it was one of our better meetings 
strangely  enough.  Reno Franconi expressed  again 
his interest in a Pascal Programming workshop, and 
it  was  decided to have just  this.  I  have  not 
worked  out the details at all on this but will be 
putting  something together in the  coming  weeks. 
The  more I think about it,  the more I think  the 
course  should  be  on programming  techniques  in 
general  with  Pascal emphasized  only  after  the 
"pseudo code" has been worked out.  Daryl Gehlbach 
brought  WordStar Release 4 and distributed it  to 
those who had bought it.  Reno visited me later in 
the  week and after an initial unsucessful attempt 
to  null modem the Kaypro formatted software  over 
to his Televideo we later got it over over to  his 
format  after using the services of UNIFORM on  an 
IBM PC. This is a non-PD program which understands 
many  formats,  among them,  Royal alphaTronic PC, 
Kaypro II,  4,  10,  Osborne SD and DD, Televideo, 
etc.  etc.  Anyone have an IBM PC they could bring 
to  the  Z  Festival  so we can  use  it  to  copy 
software,  both  that Jay Sage will bring (he  has 
expressed  an  interest  in  having  such  a  copy 
facility) and that I will bring? If so, please let 
me know!

The  CCP/M Public Domain Software Library now  has 
103  volumes.  There are 3668 files  in  it.  This 
represents  a project that I have been working  on 
for several years actually.  Almost all redundancy 
has been removed, a catalogue has been printed and 
will  be  available at a modest cost ($2)  at  the 
Festival.  It's  a  20 page (double  sided  pages) 
document  and  was  generated  using  FATCAT,  the 
FATter but faster CATaloguer.  Almost all squeezed 
files  have  been  unsqueezed and  then  crunched. 
Related files (source, help, doc, object, example, 
etc.)  have been LiBRaried.  I lost track  a  long 
time  ago,  but  if I were to guess,  I would  say 
these  103  Kaypro DD (191k) floppies used  to  be 
about 300 disks!  What a project.  I have not been 
able  yet to put together what is  really  needed, 
namely  a one or two line description of what  the 
files  are for.  But I do know that everything  in 
the  library  has  been  tested,   edited,  fixed, 
compiled,  assembled,  enhanced etc.  etc. I had a 
ball  doing this and am proud of what we  have.  I 
would even venture to say that CCP/M may very well 
have  one of the best CP/M (ZCPR3 etc.)  libraries 
around... Check it out.

Since  the  Z  Fest  is so  close  to  the  second 
Tuesday,  I  have  decided to cancel  the  regular 
meeting  of  CCP/M.  ie.  DON'T  show  up  at  the 
Farmington   Public  Library  on  Tuesday  the   8 
th!!!!!!  Unless  you  need  to take  out  Stephen 
King's "The Eyes of the Dragon" or the like.

In  my PD Software Library project,  I ran  across 
once  again what I find to be one of the  funniest 
pieces of writing I've ever seen. See "How to Make 
a  Board"  elsewhere in this  issue.  Speaking  of 
funny writing, the following definition is part of 
an extensive list of equally amusing ones and  was 
shown to me at work.  We'll print the full list as 
soon as I can type it up:

COPY-PROTECTED:  A  clever  method  of  preventing 
incompetent  pirates  from STEALING  software  and 
legitimate customers from USING the software.

Here's  a brief list of uploads to my RCP/M during 
the  last  few months.  This is not  meant  to  be 
exhaustive. It's meant to show that there's been a 
tremendous  amount of very good software and  text 
uploads  and I encourage you to look into our very 
active collection.

I  have been talking with the folks who  make  the 
ON! computer. They are shipping me a new one! They 
will  be  getting a full write up in  these  pages 
soon I expect. But I just want to say that John C. 
and  Bill E.,  their hard- and software  technical 
team, are terrific. The original ON! suffered from 
what  John  could  only term  "infant  mortality". 
They've  had hardware trouble in only 3  of  those 
they've  shipped.  The new one will have 4 mb  RAM 
disk,  which  is what I wanted in the first place. 
The ON! is a state-of-the-art Z system. I am quite 
confident  it will work fine and will be  bringing 
it,  and my new Royal,  to the  Festival.  Strange 
combo I know. The Royal system cost me $970 (I got 
a  lot  of  software,  the color monitor  and  the 
better  printer).  The ON!  $3700.  And they  both 
appear to be excellent buys.

A  consultant I work with named Rich Zlatkus  gave 
me  a PD full screen editor for the Commodore  64. 
He wrote it.  It appears to be very good.  If  you 
are  interested  in this,  I will be bringing  the 
disk   and  the  hardcopy  documentation  to   the 
Festival.  It was written in Commodore Basic.  And 
compiled.  Rich  is also trying to market a  front 
end to KEDIT, an XEDIT work-a-like for the IBM PC. 
This  guy is very sharp.  Check out  his  Personal 
WORDprocessor  (for this is what he calls his C-64 
editor).  He's looking for feedback on  it.  Don't 
let this pass you by if you have a C-64 (or -128).

I  am  trying to finish this so I can  visit  Mort 
Fabricant.  He  needs an up-to-date list of  CCP/M 
membership.  At Tom Veile's and my last count,  24 
people  have paid up.  This is out of some 45  odd 
members  in  1986-87.  I know a few who  are  just 
absent minded. At least I hope they are. But there 
are  going  to be quite a few people who may  miss 
this  Dec.  news because they did not renew  their 
dues.  We cannot operate without the money to  pay 
for the news. Please send in your $15 to Tom Veile 
if  you  feel membership is something you want  to 
continue having.  We'll miss you if you don't  !!! 
Mort sent me a solution to my First Annual T-Shirt 
Giveaway Programming Contest.  It was not  machine 
readable  and so I asked his to supply same.  Hope 
this all comes together in time.  I've included my 
BASIC solution.  If you don't recall, this problem 
had  to do with automating the evaluation  of  all 
those  worthless lottery tickets we've been buying 
lately. Mort's solution appears at first glance to 
be an interesting example of dBase I  programming. 
Can't  wait  to  try it out.  Thus  the  need  for 
machine  readable copy.  Machine readable copy  is 
ALWAYS   advised.   It   makes  an  editor's   job 
infinitely  easier.  Thanx Mort for  contributing. 
And  also for your ambitious work on the  database 
for the YOU-CCP/M gang. Well done. Now all we have 
to  do is keep people interested in  having  their 
names stay on the roster!

Well,  better  close this.  I look forward to Dec. 
with  some  uneasiness.  I know it's going  to  be 
fantastic.  But  I see lots of work yet to  do  to 
make it so.  I hope everyone that comes has a good 
time. PS. Linda's baking a million cookies and I'm 
bringing  Finast's 100 cupper for coffee.  Bring a 
friend.   Stay  for  a  while.  Ask  Jay  Sage  an 
interesting question.

Keep in touch.
