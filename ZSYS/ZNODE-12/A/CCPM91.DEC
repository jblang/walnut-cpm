At 8:30 PM, Tom Mannion gave a presentation of various 
Compression/De-compression formats for CP/M . (I.E. Squeeze, Crunch, 
.ARK, .ZIP, etc.)

Several flurried jokes of wit followed about files which had 
extensions which already had the used .-?- format. COWS. was used as 
an example, such as crunch would create COWS.ZZZ, which brought out 
the pun of 'Sleeping Cows' which was followed by 'Letting "ZZZ"'ing 
Cows "YYY".'  Available from Lee's BBS, CRLZH20.LBR contains the most 
recent LZH Compression, utility, and the Un-Crunch utility which will 
cover Squeezed, All versions of Crunch, and the last versions of 
LZH-Crunch. Howard Goldstein's LBREXT will also extract/Un-crunch up 
to the latest LZH 2.0.  No, CRLZH20.LBR will Not be Crunched! 
download: 90K. LBREXT is less than 80K, and may or may not be a better 
choice. But is available for either Z-system or CP/M 2.2. Steve 
Dresser noted that versions 2.3, and 2.5 to 2.8 to handled date 
stamping, which 2.4 did not. MS-DOS .ZIP files can be extracted with 
UNZIP 1.5, and can be directory viewed with ZIPDIR 1.2. There is an 
older version of UNZIP,  UNZIP099, which required external overlay 
files, on the disk to received the file. .ARC & .ARK files can be 
extracted and viewed by UNARC 1.6, which comes in UNARC16.ARK, which 
can be downloaded, renamed to UNARC16.COM, Run, and it will 
self-extract into the Doc's, an 8080 and a Z80 version.

George's Pizza. (It's CHOW-TIME!)

Stephen Griswold, Acting Secretary. (Give me a break, It's my 1st time 
as a Secretary!)
