Treasurer's Report: We have $765 in the bank.

Trenton - The annual show for computer hobbyists. Jay Sage is bringing 
things together. It will be scheduled for April 17/18. (See elsewhere for 
the official announcement.)

Gary Stagliano showed us a 4-bit sound sample player on his Commodore 128 
in CP/M mode. Running on a minimal system consisting of the 128, 1 drive 
and a mono monitor.

AutoTog was also demonstrated showing a few PCX pictures. Would have been 
nicer if Gary had brought his color monitor :')

Mike Dalene gave us a lecture on how to FTP from the Internet through 
Delphi.

Then we got our usual threat from the library that they were closing, so 
all but Tom Mannion and Mike met at George's.

In attendance were:

Eric Palm, Michele Dalene, Lee Bradley, Steve Dresser, Tom Veile, Al 
Hathway, Diane Thome, Stephen Griswold, Tom Mannion, and Gary Stagliano.

Eric Palm, acting Secretary.
