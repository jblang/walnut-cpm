                          MEETING NOTES
                 by Ray Brown, Acting Secretary


                          NOVEMBER '91



Steve Dresser convened the meeting.  Lee Bradley read the secre-
tary's notes from the October meeting as printed in "Smaller is 
Better".  The notes were accepted as read without corrections.

Tom Mannion gave the treasurer's report, as best he could.  He 
and Tom Veile have not been able to get together for the changing
of the checkbook ceremony.  Therefore, Tom M.'s best estimate was
"around $310, give or take, with 2 or 3 checks" that he can't 
deposiô becauså oæ thå lacë oæ á checkbook®  (Note to members:  
If you like to get float on your checks then now is the time to 
renew!)  Iî thå Tomó' joint defense, it seems that there is more 
to this than just handing over the pen and checkbook from one to 
the other.  Other complications are that there needs to be a new 
account and a new tax number.   

Lee stated that he had been contacted by Tom Veile and Jim Taylor
prior to the meeting and that both could not attend the meeting.  
Tom could not clear-up a scheduling conflict.  Jim was under the 
weather.


NEW BUSINESS

A question was raised about availability of a membership list.
Lee replied that he would put the list on the board under the
file CCPM.TXT.  The procedure for viewing the file is:

                        ZMD SP CCPM.TEXT

The file will be in user area C15.

Zed-Fest brought together 16 ardent Z'ers.  A working Yasbec
computer made it's debut.  Stephen Griswold and Lee Bradley 
represented CCP/M.  Amoung the rest:  Jay Sage and Ian Cottrell.
Photos are rumoured for the next "Eight Bits & Change".

Stephen Griswold also brought the Connecticut Yasbec to the 
meeting for inspection.  It is amazing that something smaller
than a shoe box top can outperform a venerable Kaypro, et al.
The main question surrounds the whereabouts of Yasbec software.

Glen Gross has donated his CP/M library to the club.  Lee 
brought in 2 large boxes of books, which were reconoitered
by those in attendance with vigor.  There is a lot of great 
stuff here for novice to expert.  Lee has the Dbase II manuals 
plus those not needed by meeting participants.  (This surprise
impromptu bookfare demonstrates the benefits to attending ourŠmeetings in person.)

Reno Franconi brought up the subject of future meeting topics
with his request for a Genie training session.  (Any expert
Genie users who want to do this?)  Tom stated that he would 
like to do a meeting presentation on "The Best of Utilities".
Steve D. assigned him the topic for the December meeting, and
gave the upcoming schedule for the first quarter of 1992:

     January - Packet Radio, by Sigurd Kimpel and Steve Dresser 
    February - Octiport (?), by Al Hathaway
       March - Open, but could be the Genie Seminar, or, 
               "The Best of Utilities, II"
       April - Gambling & Computers, by Ray Brown


MEETING PRESENTATION

                      "The Mandelbrot Set"
                               or
        "How to Print Strange Pictures on Epson Printers"

At first, it seemed that Lee had finally found that patch of 
magic mushrooms that is depicted on the back of his jacket.
He distributed Rorbasch-looking graphic printouts and rifled
through a flipchart of what appeared to be a five page 
equation of imaginary numbers.  Stunning was a good word.
But, little by little, you could see the lights coming back on
as Lee demonstrated that random subsets of this equation 
produced pictures of ferns and animals and ... well, LIFE!
If you missed it, or want to further study these phenomena,
Lee's presentation was drawn from the book:

                             "CHAOS"
                         by James Gleick


The meeting adjourned, as usual, for the friendly confines of
George's Family Restaurant and pizza.  And, for those of you 
that may not know and are asking, there were mushrooms on the
pizzas.

In attendance at the meeting:  Steve Dresser, Tom Manion, 
Lee Bradley, Stephen Griswald, Diane Thome, Sigurd Kimpel,
Reno Franconi, Bob Bates and Ray Brown.

Jim:  Can you check w/Lee on the following points:
   1-There was a new guy at the meeting but I didn't catch 
     his name, can you add him to the list?
   2-Was it Lee and Steve Griswold or Dresser at Zed-Fest?
  
thanks, ray
