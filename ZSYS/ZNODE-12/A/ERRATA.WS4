MODEM ERRATA:

GO PLACIDLY among the line noise and baud rates, and remember ç
what boredom there was before BBSing. As far as possible, do not ç
covet even to the nerds that pester you, for they have something ç
to say even if you can't figure out what it is.

Avoid female impersonators when in chat mode, for they are ç
dangerous to your ego. If you compare yourself with others, you ç
may consider suicide; for there is always someone more proficient ç
in Zmodem than yourself. Label your disks.

Keep interested in your own career, however humble; even after ç
staying up all night downloading. Exercise caution in your ç
business affairs, because you need the money to pay your ç
CompuServe bill. But let this not blind you to what enjoyment ç
there is on your local BBS; many persons strive for the most ç
recent shareware, and uploads get you more time on line.

Be yourself. Especially, do not lie about your age or looks when ç
responding to Email. Do not post messages in all caps. Neither be ç
cynical about donations to the sysop; for in the face of all ç
reality, he needs the money for the phone lines. Beware of ç
viruses.

Take kindly the counsel of Phil Katz and Chuck Forsberg, ç
gracefully admitting that they know more than you will ever ç
learn. Nurture strength of spirit to shield you from sudden hard ç
disk crashes. But do not distress yourself with needless worry. ç
Many fears are born of fatigue from being connected all night to ç
ExecPC. Register your shareware.

You are a child of the universe, you have a right to buy a 9600 ç
V-Series Hayes. And whether or not it is clear to you, the ç
communications program is understandable. Read the docs.

Therefore, be at peace with the sysop, no matter what a jerk he ç
is, and whatever your BBS plans may be, take your wife out to ç
dinner occasionally.

With all its bad documentation, high registration fees, and ç
aborted downloads, it is still better than paying for commercial ç
software. Be cheerful. Strive to pay your phone bill.
