Tom Mannion brought his 386DX/40 with 180Mb HD and Super VGA and Sound 
Blaster Pro sound card. It was packaged in a tower case but the boards and 
drives took up so little space that a mini-tower case would be sufficient.  
The computer was equipped with a high density 5.25 and 3.5 drive and an 
additional 3.5 double density drive. Tom is searching for a controller that 
would control both 5.25 without having to physically unplug one.

Pink Rose: (a BBS) 738-3064 Winsted Ct.

Al brought his 386/SX laptop with MyZ80 installed. MyZ80 gives new life to 
the CP/M users as the old Kaypro and Osborne hardware finally dies.

Sec Report: Accepted as read.

Treas Report: Fair holding our $641.83 not including two mailings. Sold an 
H88 for $10.00 to Mike Dalene

MyZ80 is a Z80 emulator for AT or better machines and it really works. It 
is quite fast!  CPM 3.0 still does not seem to run yet. Jay Sage is 
thinking of taking over support for the software in the USA. Even SuperZap 
the graphic disk editor works.

WordStar had no trouble editing 500K, 1MB and 1.5Mb files under MyZ80.  
Gramatic for DOS seems to corrupt large files. Gramatic for CP/M does not 
show this problem.
