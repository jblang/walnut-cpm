                          November 13, 1990

     The meeting was open to general discussion. Gabor took some 
preliminary notes including a question regarding Robert Bates' status 
as a member. The membership approved to have Bob receive a deluxe 
membership for the $10 dues.

     Gary Stagliano commented on Connecticut's Surplus Sales outlet.  
Connecticut State Surplus is located near the Motor Vehicle Department 
in Wethersfield. Gary said there is a veritable goldmine of computers, 
terminals, printers etc. Check this place out!

     Jim Taylor passed around a tool kit for computer hardware use. He 
got it at a sale for $10.

      Gary Stagliano and Brian Nalewajek made some remarks about 
CCP/M's possible role in developing a good modem terminal program.  
Gary mentioned David Goodenough's work on QTERM. [Editor's Note: David 
is known for his work on QTERM, Rogue, CP/M UseNET software, EXL (a 
library typer,) a ZIP file directory program and no doubt a lot more.  
End Of Note]
     
     A question was raised by Bob Bates who wanted to know what 
"source code" was. After several attempts by the members, Al Hathway 
described source code as any generic input which must be translated 
into binary executable code. Lee Bradley further illustrated this 
definition with an example on the board. It was very informative but 
it showed very clearly how some of us neophytes have to hang on by our 
nails to keep a proper perspective of understanding computer operation.

     The general discussion was completed and various demonstrations 
by Stephen Griswold and Al Hathway took place. [Editor's Note: Al has 
been working with a Z-System utility named EXTEND which he found on a 
ZSUS disk. He has indicated he will have something to present on it at 
a future meeting. Stephen brought his standard truckload of hardware 
and I believe assisted someone who needed some software copied from 
one disk format to another. End Of Note]

     We had an interesting conversation with Al Hathway who described 
his cross country bicycle trip with all the adventures and hardships.  
He could write a story about his experiences.
