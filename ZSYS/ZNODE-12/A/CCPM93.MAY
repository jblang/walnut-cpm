Secretary's Report: The minutes of the last meeting were accepted as 
published.

Treasurer's Report: We now have $795.93 in the treasury with all the 
previous bills paid including the Treasurer's dues ...

Trenton Computer Fest: A number of us attended along with the usual 
collection of Z-system gurus. The Hartford area is known as a hotbed of 
CP/M activity. Small substitute for a losing hockey team. Howard Goldstien 
was the recipient of the floating CP/M award. Banked bios for the newer 
CP/M (Ampro, YASBEC etc.) computers has been released (six systems in all). 
The bios resides in the second bank, increasing the TPA. It is similar to 
CP/M plus and compatable in many ways but is still based on CP/M 2.2. The 
weather was fantastic. The Party was good. Jay beat Lee in the Pizza eating 
contest. Prices for Z-system products have been reduced to about $20.00 
each in Kaypro and MS-DOS format only. Check out the next TCJ!

Stephen Griswold brought a Xerox 820 II computer with dual 8" disk drives 
to the meeting along with the entire SIG/M collection on 8" flippies.

CD ROMs with CP/M software: Streaming Tape Back-up unit was provided to Lee 
to provide the software: Bob Dean, Jay Sage, Bruce Morgen will participate. 
The Royal Oaks collection should be included. Simtel 20 computer has much 
of its software on CD-ROMs. Z-SUS should also be included.

MYZ80: Tom Mannion received the latest version of MyZ80 (1.11) with a very 
nice letter. As a registered user you are entitled to one free upgrade. Tom 
is amazed that he received any upgrades.

MyZ80 handles virtual disk files of up to 8 MB each. How do give those 
virtual disks to others? After you build the file (eg. A.DSK) (up to 5 
megs) one way is to Zip the file with PKZip 2.04G then use SLICE to break 
the files into smaller parts. SLICE makes a SPLICE program that allows you 
to reconstruct the file. Don't use the DOS utility BACKUP because the 
versions of BACKUP are not compatable with each other.

CMD Tour: On June 14th, 7:00pm a guided Tour of CMD will be sponsored by 
the Capital Region Commodore Computing club. CMD markets SCSI hard drives 
for CP/M commodore and IBM/MacIntosh computers. There will be Free grab 
bags of software and hardware. More information and directions will be 
available at our June meeting. Contact Raymond Cruz on Z-node 12 or call 
749-6002 for more information.

If was moved to make Hal Bower (author of z-dos and banked bios) an 
honorary member and give him a Kaypro II from the club's inventory for 
shipping and handling. Club members are entitled to use the various club 
hardware donations upon request subject to approval at the next general 
meeting.

Add David McGlown (Z-Letter publisher/editor) to our list of Honorary 
members. Honorary members are sent to issues of SIB for the remainder of 
their natural lives.

Today is Tom Mannion's birthday. At the Georges Pizza meeting Tom was 
presented with a flaming cake recognizing his 42 years on this planet.  
Steve Dresser was almost set afire before Tom was able to extinguish the 
flames. He must have gotten his wish as all MS-DOS machines ceased 
functioning.
