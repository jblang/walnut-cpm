it to upload a "big" version of MODEM &/or USQ. The only mod's will be the
send/receive masks in line 280 and the addresses for your modem in the same
line.  You need a Z80-8080 processor to use this prog.  BMODEM, when run,
will be a dumb terminal -- ESC key will send a CTRL-C, the tilde a CTRL-S,
and CTRL-E will start receiving from XMODEM... along with a file prompt.
