                    CP/M Users' Group Meeting
                          June 6, 1992

Twelve stalwart members and others attended the meeting, which 
started based on Al Hathway's agenda.

The Secretary's report being in the last newsletter, its reading 
was omitted and it was accepted without corretions.

The Treasurer's report showed a present balance of $649.33.  This 
too was gladly accepted. (Of course $1649.33 too would have been 
gladly accepted.)

In the matter of donated software the club has received from various 
donors,  Tom Mannion has sent letters of acknowledgement to the 
donors.

The call for donations has been heard and has elicited a generous 
response:

a Kaypro-2 ('84)                              by Ray Brown,    

a H-89                                        by Tom Veile,

a Kaypro II and two Hazetine terminals        by Arlene Jones

an Osborne II with printer                    by C. Osborne

a Kaypro IV with printer                      by Adr. Marks

an Osborne II with various software (on loan) by Randy       .

Also, Tom Mannion is offering for sale an Eagle 2 computer.

Steve  Dresser asked for offers of presentations for  the  coming 
months.   Again, Al Hathway stepped into the breach and  offerred 
to  talk  about  the  BDS-Z compiler, about  ZMAC,  and  the  DSD 
debugger.  Lee Bradley also offerred to talk about some topic. 

Gabor Szikla related his concern about safe power.  He had a  new 
computer go belly up for unknown reasons one of which might  have 
been  a  power surge.  He has heard that some of  the  protection 
devices, MOVs, e.g., have consumable protection caapability after 
which  they no longer protect.  Ray Brown told of an  article  in 
T(he) C(omputer) J(ournal) which is a primer on surge protectors.

The business portion of the meeting was adjourned at 8:06 to hear 
Steve Dresser's presentation on the M-Disk he installed.

Program:   Steve (Dresser) and Steve (Griswold) installed the  M-
Disk  (RAM  disk)  extension in Steve's  (Dresser)  AMPRO.   This 
entailed  the  installation of the M-Disk  board  with  extensive 
hardware change instructions.  They "shortcircuited" part of  the 
installation process with success and cut down on the work.  

Next Steve handed out the listing of the NZSTART alias file.   He 
explained the instruction lines and showed the development of the 
file.  He demonstrated the benefits of the RAM drive by running a 
linking task both with the RAM drive and the hard disk.  The  RAM 
drive  showed  a 25% speed-up.  -  It was a  well  organized  and 
effective demonstration; thanks, Steve.
