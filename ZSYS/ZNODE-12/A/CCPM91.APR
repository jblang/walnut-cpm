                            April 9, 1991

Jim Taylor opened the meeting at 6:40 P.M. He asked if there were any 
areas of discussion for the business portion.  Lee Bradley had 
concerns of late payments from CCP/M for services rendered.  However, 
Tom Veile arrived and saved the day with an appropiate check!

Al Hathway had worked on a program developing library files using 
NZ.COM.  Reno suggested that Al demonstrate how such a library can be 
developed as noted. Lee Bradley, after much badgering from Reno 
looking for help, decided to expand on the file program and show in 
detail how to work Al's Demo.Lbr and develop similar files.

After having both computers set up (Lee's Royal and Reno's TeleVideo), 
Lee transferred all his files he developed through a modem using a 
null mode. After the successful transfer, Lee proceeded to explain how 
the Alias.Cmd file had to come into play to establish access and the 
proper root path. One of the keys to jockey files and command datum 
back and forth was the use of Zfiler.  One other important key was to 
set a special location for this program other than A: or B:. Lee 
selected B3: and worked it in through Zfiler to establish the proper 
path. When all this information was in its proper place, all that one 
had to do was to call any of the files or one of the numerous help 
commands found in B3: location. Now if you have followed this 
description to your understanding give me a call and we'll share the 
information.  Actually, much of the intricacies have been omitted 
because of two reasons:

 1. I did not remember all of them.
 2. Some moves went too fast for me to understand.

However, I'm sure this program can be accessed from Lee's BBS and and 
Al Hathway can fill you on some of the finer points of his Demo.Lbr 
NZ.COM program. Lee, of course, may assist with the implementation 
process.

The following attended:

Tom Mannion, Stephen Griswold, Diane Thome, Ray Brown, Al Hathway, Jim 
Taylor, Bob Bates, Sigurd Kimpel, Gary Stagliano, Steve Dresser, Lee 
Bradley, Reno Franconi, Tom Veile.

Since the meeting room was unusually warm (Hot!),  we could hardly 
wait to depart for the nearby watering hole where many of us partook 
with the pizza+ and cooling libations!

Reno Franconi,
Secretary
