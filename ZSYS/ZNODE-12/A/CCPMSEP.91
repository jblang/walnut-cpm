                          September '91

To start things off, we were informed that The Computer Club's 
BBS (TCC: 203 673-8752) is still down. The hard disk was lost.

Tom Veile gave the Treasurer's report. He told us we have 
$377.69. The latest mailing cost $138.33. The report was accepted 
unanimously.

This was the annual business and elections meeting. Nominations 
were open, the election held and the new officers "sworn in." 
Leading the Group for 1991-92 will be: Al Hathway, President, 
Steve Dresser, Program Co-ordinator, Tom Mannion, Treasurer and 
Eric Palm, Secretary. Jim Taylor and Lee Bradley will do the 
newsletter and the software library respectively.

Newsletter dues were brought up. A brief history: About a year 
ago, Lee started publishing "Eight Bits And Change." The Group 
set its dues at $20 a year for a "deluxe" membership, which 
included "Eight Bits And Change" (a bi-monthly,) and "Smaller is 
Better" (SIB,) our monthly news bulletin. "Regular" membership 
included SIB and cost $10.

The members voted unanimously to set the dues at $15. EB&C will 
continue as an independent publication. You may subscribe to EB&C 
for $15 per year by contacting Small Computer Support, 24 East 
Cedar Street, Newington, CT 06111.

Lee announced that he and Walt Wheeler have set the weekend of 
October 18, 19 and 20 as "Zed Fest" 1991 in Albany, NY at Walt's 
place. See attached map and bulletin. Hope you can make it! This 
will be a very informal "gathering of the faithful." Ian 
Cottrell, Jay Sage, Howard Goldstein and others have already 
expressed interest in coming.

The YASBEC (Yet Another Single Board Eight Bit Computer) may be 
purchased now for about $95. Lee proposed that the Group get 
together and create what he called "The YASBEC Group" to generate 
start-up funds and plan the building of a prototype YASBEC.

Stephen Griswold would build the Group's YASBEC. He will be 
remimbursed. Gary Stagliano offered to donate a NEW 3.5" drive, 
Lee offered to donate $100. Al Hathway suggested a design team of 
Lee Bradley, Al Hathway, Gary Stagliano, and Stephen Griswold. 
Lee will order the board.

I would like to formally welcome Dana Peterson (love them smiley 
faces!). Welcome!

In attendance: Lee Bradley, Steve Dresser, Gary Stagiano, Dana 
Peterson, Stephen Griswold, Tom Veile, and Eric Palm.

Late news, Al says Star-Link has raised their fees. It used to be 
$10 a month, plus $1.50 per hour, non-prime, plus 1 cent per 1K 
over the initial limit. I believe it is now $3 per hour, non- 
prime time.

Members wishing to do so adjourned for beer, pizza and soda at 
George's Family Restaurant.

Eric Palm, Secretary
