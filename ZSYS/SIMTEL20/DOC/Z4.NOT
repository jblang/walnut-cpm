PD:<ZSYS.DOC>Z4.NOT

The file Z4.TXT in PD:<ZSYS.DOC> is a copy of some of the
transparencies from my presentation on ZCPR4 at the Trenton
Computer Festival.  Parts of the presentation, particularly
those on Ada and my current computing environment (which includes
a SUN 3/260 with 8M bytes of RAM, 237M bytes of disk, running
4.3 BSD UNIX with SYSTEM V extensions with SUNTOOLS), are not
included in Z4.TXT.
