Howdy..feeling lousy, could not sleep, head splitting, nose plugged, ears
snappy..so I tinkered around..now is 4:15 am...been studying disk drives, call-
ing BBs and found below at CC BB and downloaded that. Studied the TEAC manual
to find out why Elephant disk did not work and think I found out.  The drives
operate on two methods, MF and MFM, whatever they mean. MF is lower or 40 tracks
and MFM is higher or 80 tracks. I compared them with TEAC55B and TEAC55F and
came upon interesting information.

On B, Capacity (Kbytes), FM=163.84, MFM=327.68 and on F, FM=327.68, MFM=655.36.
You can see that 163.84 has shifted from MF to MFM in F. Looks like the two
drives are very different animals and can't talk to each other. With this info,
I am going to try experement with your TEAC45B and my drives and see If I can
arrive at something. Failing this, it means we wont be able to exchange disks
unless we config a disk to KAYPRO II and copy from those.   Cheerios Motty

  Notes:

     1) The DSx entry used throughout signifies the appropriate drive
	select option for the location of the drive in your system.
	Most drives have either DS0,DS1,DS2,DS3 or DS1,DS2,DS3,DS4.
     2) The terminator pack, if present, should be installed on the
	drive physically at the end of the cable only.	It should be
	removed from all other drives on the system.
