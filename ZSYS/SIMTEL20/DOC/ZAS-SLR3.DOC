Subject:  Let's "mellow out" a bit!

Fellow CP/Mers - I have been reading with interest but also with growing
concern the exchange of messages between Jay Sage and Rick Conn concerning
Rick's adoption of the ZAS assembler as a "standard" for his further develop-
ment of ZCPR and related software.  The "discussion" started off a bit on the
"edgy" side, but it is now rapidly approaching nasty.  This is a real shame,
because Jay is generally raising reasonable questions of interest to many of
us, and I for one would like to hear the answers.  But having witnessed one
p___ing contest on this list already (it was about a modem program, a couple
years ago), I definitely don't want to see that happen again.

     In my opinion, Rick Conn DOESN'T OWE US ANYTHING!  He has created and
donated free of cost an ENORMOUS software suite that takes about 5 megabytes
of storage in the archive.  This is the result of several years of work,
and it still boggles me that Rick has GIVEN IT AWAY.  Just reading through the
pounds of well written documentation seems to take forever!  So if Rick wants
to standardize on the ZAS assembler (or COBOL, or SNAFU, or whatever), it's
entirely his business, and I don't think we have any RIGHTS in the matter.
Rick may possibly do some things that will cut off part of the community who
are currently enjoying his efforts, and that will be sad.  I don't think this
has happened yet, but if it does, I hope to see some messages in this forum
seeking a compromise solution.  I also hope such messages will be courteous
and respectful.  After all, even the creator of 5 megabytes of first class
free software can screw up occasionally!

     So let's continue to explore the new directions Rick's efforts are
taking.  If Rick says some things that seem inaccurate or that we don't
understand, let's ask him about them.  But let's also remember that Rick isn't
a one-man benevolent society.  He is not our servant.  Even if we strongly
disagree with what he is saying, let's be graceful about it.

     Let's mellow out a bit, PLEASE!


Dave

Hear, hear! to Dave Towson's comments.  If there are those who
take exception to Rick Conn's choice, then let them blaze the
"road not taken".  They can be tomorrow's heros rather than
today's martyrs.
