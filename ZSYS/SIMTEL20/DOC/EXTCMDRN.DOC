EXTENDED CMDRUN PROCESSING VIA AN ALIAS AND FLOW CONTROL
--------------------------------------------------------
ALIAS, Version 1.1
 Alias Name: CMDRUN  
 Old Alias Command Line:
  1 --> IF EX A0:$1.ZEX;	|I keep ZEX files on A0:       
  2 --> ZEX $*;			|invoke ZEX with full command tail        
  3 --> ELSE;			|no ZEX file?                  
  4 --> LRUN $*;		|try COMMAND.LBR for a COM file
  5 --> FI			|(with full command tail)

The above ALIAS script is an extension of the ZCPR3 CMDRUN
processor.  It allows both ZEX and LRUN (LRUN22 or LRUNZ302)
to act as dual extended command processors through the use 
of parameter passing and ZCPR3 Flow Commands.  When I first
attempted something of this sort, it provoked some strange
responses from some of the COM files in COMMAND.LBR, so I
gave up on the idea.  Then I saw a rather simplified version of
the concept in a note by Dreas Nielsen on Norman Beeler's
Zee-Machine Z-Node.  Dreas said something like "use as many
parameters as you want" and then it hit me: why use
individual parameters at all, except to check for the existence
of a ZEX file?  Apparently, an ALIAS file passes empty
parameters, in some cases, as ASCII spaces (20h) and some
programs are written to respond to any character as a passed
parameter.  By using the ALIAS `$*' parameter (thank you, Rick
Conn!) we can make sure that only existing parameters are passed
and solve the problem.  ZEX is much more tolerant of being
passed `spacey' parameters, but `$*' is more elegant there too.
I'd like to see alternate CMDRUNs implemented in ZCPR3 itself -
this approach is a bit slow for my floppy-based system, but
will have to do for now - you lucky hard disk owners will
probably hardly notice the 25% speed penalty when compared to
LRUN22 or ZEX used alone as CMDRUN.COM.
