                     ABOUT ZCPR3 AND Z3-DOT-COM

Flexibility  is  key to ZCPR3 power.   Productivity results  from 
optimum  organization of human and machine  resources.   You  are 
free  to  create  the thinking and working environment  that  you 
choose!   ZCPR3 permits quick computer system re-organization for 
varying  tasks  and  controls  your  application  programs   from 
integrated  easily  produced and changed  menus.   Generation  of 
aliases  permit many commands and keystrokes to be converted to a 
few.   Aliases may be used from within menus.   One alias may use 
another.   Control is near absolute using the supplied utilities.  
Menu generation determines how the computer is used,  simplifying 
and  speeding operations.   Only single from-menu keystrokes  are 
needed to activate many complex series of commands.

ZCPR3 changes as you change--a system you use,  learn from,  grow 
and live with!

Utilities  provided  permit  file  and  disk   management,   easy 
coordination of many application programs from chained menus with 
full  security  and  password protection.   Online  help  assists 
understanding  details  of each  command  available.   A  summary 
command  reference  card  is  also provided with  a  glossary  of 
computer and ZCPR3 word meanings.   The installation procedure is 
eleven (11) lines at the bottom of the command reference card.

ZCPR3  is available in two versions:  the manual  install  system 
using CP/M MOVCPM,  SYSGEN and DDT,  and the auto-install Z3-Dot-
Com  version.   Both versions have advantages,  depending on your 
understanding  and desires,  whether you are a computer  user  or 
programmer.

Z3-Dot-Com is sold in either a single or 4-disk set.  The single-
disk  package  is for those who have obtained the  manual-install 
ZCPR3  Core  and  Utilities software and want now  to  add  auto-
install  to  their collection.   The 4-disk set is  complete  and 
provides seventy (70) utility files in object form.   The  source 
for the utilities is not supplied,  as it occupies over eight (8) 
additional disks.   The manual-install utilities may be used with 
Z3-Dot-Com  by  using the Z3INS.COM,  ZCPR3.INS and Z3.ENV  files 
supplied or auto-produced during install process.

The #1 disk used for installation has sufficient reserve space to 
permit  creation of four (4) special files  during  installation.  
The  #2 disk has remaining utilities not on disk #1.   Disks #3 & 
#4  have the online help files used from tree-structure  HELP.COM 
central menus.

Z3-Dot-Com installs on all CP/M-80 computers,  those using  8080, 
8085,   NSC-800  and  Z80  microprocessors.    The  install  menu 
presently has over 50 terminals and computers to fully handle CRT 
screen capabilities.  We add to the menus as we gain knowledge of 
additional control and escape sequences.



Future  utilities  planned for the ZCPR3 System can be  installed 
and  used  with  Z3-Dot-Com by adding the  utility  name  to  the 
ZCPR3.INS  file with any CP/M editor and then running Z3INS  with 
Z3.ENV  and  ZCPR3.INS.  Installation then occurs  automatically.  
Files  named in the ZCPR3.INS list not on the present disk  being 
installed are ignored.

Assembly of the ZCPR3 batch and flow control processor ZEX.ASM is 
required after installation of Z3-Dot-Com has  occurred.   Submit 
(batch)  processor  EX.COM and ZEX.ZEX batch file is provided  to 
make the assembly automatic.   The CP/M utility programs required 
to assemble ZEX:  1) MAC, 2) ED, and 3) SID or ZSID.  Other files 
required,  RELS.UTL  and EX,  are public domain and  supplied  by 
Echelon.
