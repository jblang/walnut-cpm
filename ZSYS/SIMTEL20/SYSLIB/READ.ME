	The CRCs for all binary files in this distribution check out.
Due to the nature of the ASCII conversion process for the text files,
however, the CRCs for SYSLIBD.DOC do not match the CRCs given in the
file SYSLIB.CRC.  Not to worry: I believe SYSLIBD.DOC to be correct.
SYSLIBD.DOC was prepared using Word Star and the 8th bits did not
carry over in the conversion process on SIMTEL20.
