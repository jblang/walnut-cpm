Help Needed!   Armon A.  Tippit,  605 Hampton Road,  Bowling Green,  KY 42101, 
502/843-6373,  needs  help sorting out his S-100 CCS 2719 I/O board cabled  to 
Hayes  Smartmodem.   He'd  also  like someone to do some wire-wrapping  on  an 
unusual ROM board he designed.   Here's your chance to be of service (and make 
a bit of money)--go for it!   (Armon is special to Echelon  community;  please 
HELP!)

PUBLIC ZRDOS PLUS.    From  directory  B0:WORK,  let's look at  built-in  help 
contained  within  utility PUBLIC.COM.   A complete Z-style HLP file  is  also 
distributed,  along with new DIR, Version 1.2, for file listing in both normal 
and public directories.

B0:WORK>PUBLIC //<cr>
PUBLIC, Version 1.0
Syntax:  PUBLIC
      or PUBLIC /oooo...
Options: Cc - Clear PUBLIC declarations
          c=A Clear All PUBLIC declarations
          c=D Clear PUBLIC User Area Drive
          c=U Clear PUBLIC User
         Dd - Declare Drive=d, PUBLIC
         Uu - Declare User=u, PUBLIC
B0:WORK>;Example of use:  setup 4 and 8
B0:WORK>;on drive (disk) A as PUBLIC user areas.
B0:WORK>PUBLIC /CA,DA,U4,U8<cr>

First we clear existing settings,  if any,  then declare drive (disk) A,  user 
areas  4 and 8 public.   Very simple!   Next,  we move our special files  into 
these  areas.   We can now access them and their overlays from any  user  area 
with  but  one copy on our system,  the one placed on disk A in area 4  or  8. 
Typing PUBLIC<cr> displays directory public status, i.e., which disks and user 
areas are presently public.
     In  Z-News  304 we stated there were 32 directories possible  for  public 
areas.   Well,  it's  not  that simple.   Drives A through H and user areas  1 
through 8 can be declared, giving potential of actually 64.  But if, e.g., A1: 
is made public and B2:  is also, both A2: and B1: automatically become public; 
so watch it!  Really, we simply can't think of needing more than 3 to 5 public 
areas.  But maybe you can; let us know.
     After getting PUBLIC ZRDOS running,  the thought came to put SYS.ENV in a 
public area;  thus,  new COM utilities are installed without having to declare 
SYS.ENV  location.   We added declarations to our STARTUP.COM alias so  PUBLIC 
areas  are  automatically created during cold boot.   Presently,  we  use  A6: 
directory (paradoxically we call it PRIVATE:, and needs password to enter) for 
all our special files like dBASE and WordStar.   (We also have B6:  public for 
really tough jobs.   We found The WORD Plus requires its UPDICT.CMP file to be 
always  on A0.)  Of course,  user must have WHEEL true (ON) status for  PUBLIC 
utility to function, making PUBLIC safe for RAS usage.
     There are many ways to skin-a-cat, but important thing is that successful 
skinning  occurs.   Case  in point:   under PUBLIC  ZRDOS,  our  WordStar  and 
The WORD Plus  VFILER  CMD lines are really flexible.   Compare with those  in 
DEMO.LBR  (future newsletter explains difference between current  and  default 
disk/user area log-ins):

  1 %d%u:;ws %f    or    1 %u:;get 100 ws.com;poke 392 ff;go %d:%f
  2 a%u:;spell %d:%f $slic;review;markfix %d:%f $m#;%d:;ws %f

     ZRDOS  Plus  with PUBLIC DIRECTORIES is offered for $59.50 plus  shipping 
and handling.   Those owning ZRDOS, ZRDOS Plus, or Z-Com may upgrade for usual 
$20.00 (if Z3-Dot-Com,  $40.95;  see Z-News 202) with return of their original 
disk.  Order now! 

We Get Letters.    From Paul Naitoh,  San Diego, CA, "I really appreciate your 
help,  as  I am but a user of programs."  Paul,  become  more!   Examine  your 
priorities  and adjust accordingly.   What's important in the longer run...you 
already know.
     Jim LaSalle,  51 Bock Lane,  Baden, PA 15005, 412/869-1358, writes, "...I 
purchased  Z3-Dot-Com.   This  solution works;  however,  I  would  prefer  to 
manually  install  ZCPR3.   Do you have any suggestions that would aid  me  in 
ZCPR3's insertion into my [Lobo Max-80] BIOS?"  Jim,  we don't understand your 
computer...any  hackers  out there willing to give him a helping hand  with  a 
Lobo?  Contact Jim directly and let us know your solution to getting a manual-
install  version  running.   Please  upload  your successful  code  to  Z-Node 
Central, so others can benefit from your work.  Makes for good karma!
     "Great newsletter!  Great software!  Keep it coming (down the lines...),"
proclaims Daniel Kelley, San Jose, CA.
     From Owensboro,  KY, David Orrahood asks, "Where can I obtain M80 and L80 
and  are  these  needed  or even recommended by you  with  the  ZAS  universal 
relocating  macro  assembler?"   We don't believe Microsoft is  selling  M/L80 
anymore,  why we offer ZAS.   ZAS can assemble most CP/M 8-bit programs in the 
public domain as well as our source.   We support ZAS and continue to make  it 
better.   All new EI code is written using it,  e.g., LGET, LHELP, LLF, and LX 
described below,  ZRDOS Plus, PUBLIC, DIR12, and overlays to TERM III, as well 
as all code associated with Micromint SB180 computer.

Amateur Z User's Corner.   Before long, after having ZCPR3 available, you take 
it  for granted.   Many have had occasion to return to simple monitor  systems 
(CP/M)  and were shocked to become conscious of what an operating system  (OS) 
is,  compared  to  a  control program/monitor.   We  know  the  feeling--we've 
experienced  such occasions.   Long live Z...and its continued expansion,  and 
support by customers.
     If a new utility does not work, think!  did you install it?  Use Z3INS to 
add  utilities  to  your system:   Z3INS A15:SYS  NEWUTIL<cr>  is  the  normal 
command,  with  Z3INS  along path,  SYS.ENV in A15:  (ROOT:),  and file  being 
installed in current directory.   Using PUBLIC ZRDOS Plus,  you can forget the 
A15: declaration requirement.

Of Cabbages and Kings.   Many have asked why we add philosophy along side  our 
computer discernments--the answer:   we deal mostly with whole people.   Some, 
having  lost (or never found) their humanly way,  rebel at what we do.   So be 
it...but,  you act with all your resources whenever you move; you bring all of 
you  to  each task.   So you are treated as fully human.   We  don't  compart-
mentalize  your various functions.   As they are together in you,  so we  deal 
with them.   It's so easy to not cognize what and who we are, especially since 
our popular studies (school classes,  magazines,  etc.) are divided into  dis-
cipline-areas of economic (concerns activity of wealth,  labor, and commerce), 
social (activity among friends,  of home,  marriage,  and family), legislative 
(activity  of executive rulership),  judicature (enactment and enforcement  of 
legal  authority),  cultural  (aesthetic interpretation of beauty through  the 
medium  of the arts),  and educational (activities  of  logic,  teaching,  and 
scientific inquiry).   They come together (merge) in your head,  in your mind; 
all come together within you.   Thus,  we deal with all--we bind All under one 
roof, Echelon!

Z  TIPS.    Bob Peddicord (Salem,  OR) puts his TALIAS in our stable of  alias 
generators and editors.   His version is very WordStar-like,  beautiful!  Give 
it a try.   It may become your favorite.   (Bob,  you and others, please don't 
slow  such tool design and coding.   Develop along EI suggested  guide  lines, 
debug, then start next one needed.)
     As  you  may  know,  Paul Pomerleau (Chicago,  IL) also  has  produced  a 
beautiful  program,  VERROR,  one that easily and efficiently permits recovery 
from command-line errors.   It's probably our favorite,  over  ERROR23.   Each 
excels,  depends on your temperament.   (Soon, we discuss Paul's VCED, command 
line editor and recall shell.)
     New  library support utilities (from Richard Conn,  author of ZCPR3)  add 
flexibility to task automation involving NULU-type libraries.   All respond to 
the QUIET flag and LX also responds to the WHEEL byte.

COMMAND:   LGET, Version 1.0
Syntax:    LGET dir:library dir:afn1,dir:afn2,... o
Option:    U - Unsqueeze squeezed files
Function:  LGET extracts specified files from indicated library.  If files are 
prefixed   with   a  directory  reference,   they  are  placed  in   indicated
directories.   If  U  option  is present and  files  are  squeezed,  they  are 
unsqueezed during extraction.
Examples of Use:
           LGET a:SYSLIB *.HQP
            -- extract all files of type HQP from the file SYSLIB.LBR on
               disk A, current user
           LGET ROOT:COMMAND B4:L*.COM,B4:L*.HQP U
            -- from library COMMAND.LBR in ROOT: directory, extract L*.COM and
               L*.HQP files and placed them in directory B4:; squeezed files
               (L*.HQP) are unsqueezed and stored under their original names

COMMAND:   LHELP, Version 1.0
Syntax:    LHELP topic
            -- get help on indicated topic in SYSTEM.LBR file
           LHELP topic dir:library
            -- get help on indicated topic in indicated library
           LHELP * library  -or-  LHELP topic *
            -- name of the topic is same as name of library

Function:  LHELP  functions similar to the HELP command (version 5.3 or later; 
see HELPSYS.HLP).   Unlike HELP,  LHELP works from library files.  It searches 
for  the indicated (or implied) library file along command search path and  in 
directory named HELP.  The search path is:
           1) indicated or default directory (dir:library)
           2) command-search path
           3) HELP directory (if any)
     Once the library file has been found,  LHELP locks onto it,  and all help 
files referenced by the indicated help file are pulled from this library file. 
The  file  "topic.HLP"  or  "topic.HQP"  is  pulled  from  the  library  file, 
unsqueezed  if  necessary,  and  processed.   If a  selection  is  made  which 
references another help file,  the indicated help file is also pulled from the 
current library and unsqueezed if necessary.
Examples of Use:
           LHELP SYSLIB *
            -- pull SYSLIB.HLP or SYSLIB.HQP from SYSLIB.LBR once SYSLIB.LBR
               is found via file search path
           LHELP CMD1
            -- pull CMD1.HLP or CMD1.HQP from SYSTEM.LBR once SYSTEM.LBR is
               found via search
           LHELP Z3LIB1 A:Z3LIB
            -- pull Z3LIB1.HLP or Z3LIB1.HQP from Z3LIB.LBR, starting file
               search from disk A, current user

COMMAND:   LLF (List Library Files), Version 1.0
Syntax:    LLF dir:library
            -- list all files in library
           LLF dir:library /o...
            -- list all files in library with options
           LLF dir:library afn1,afn2,...
            -- list selected files in library
           LLF dir:library afn1,afn2,... o...
            -- list selected files in library with options
Options:   C - Print CRCs of each file in listing
           G - Group files by file type and name (default is by file name
               and type)
           I - Print starting indices of files
           P - Send listing to printer as well as console
Function:   LLF displays a directory of declared library file.  Specific files 
may be selected by specifying a list of ambiguous file names.  The listing may 
be sent to console or printer.   File sizes (in terms of records and nearest K 
bytes) are indicated in listing.
Examples of Use:
           LLF a:SYSLIB
            -- list all files in A:SYSLIB.LBR
           LLF root:COMMAND *.COM,*.HQP CPI
            -- list *.COM and *.HQP files from COMMAND.LBR in directory
               ROOT:; include CRCs, starting indices; send output to console
               and printer
           LLF root:COMMAND /P
            -- list all files in COMMAND.LBR in ROOT:; send output to printer

COMMAND:   LX (Library eXecute), Version 1.0
Syntax:    LX command_line
            -- execute command line, extracting command verb from
               ROOT:COMMAND.LBR
           LX -dir:library command_line
            -- execute command line, extracting command verb from the
               indicated (by directory leading dash) library file
Function:  LX  performs a complete parse of the indicated command line as  the 
ZCPR3 command processor would.   Named directory references are resolved, etc, 
and the External FCB (if available), FCB 1 (at 5CH), FCB 2 (at 6CH), and TBUFF 
(at 80H) are loaded as though the ZCPR3 CP had done so.  LX does not perform a 
command  search  for the library.   The library must reside in  the  indicated 
directory, else LX fails.
     For  security,  directory references are ignored if WHEEL byte is not set 
(true).
     The name of the default library (ROOT:COMMAND.LBR) can be easily  changed 
by patching (or reassembly of LX.MAC source code for) LX.COM.
Examples of Use:
           LX XD HELP:*.*
            -- run XD.COM from ROOT:COMMAND.LBR; properly parse and process
               the command tail " HELP:*.*"
           LX -a1:ASM LIB80
            -- run LIB80.COM from ASM.LBR in A1:

Wyse  Technology  continues to do it:    adds two new terminals to  complement 
their existing line, WY50+ and WY30, $699 and $399, respectively.  New 50+ has 
amber  screen,  64-byte programmable functions keys,  more  page  memory,  bi-
directional auxiliary port,  Wyseword as standard, and TVI-950 emulation.  The 
30  is  much the same as the 50 but with fewer features,  though with  similar 
overall  characteristics.   Oh!   Wyse had sales of over $29 million for  last 
three  months,  April through June,  1985,  setting their annual rate at  120-
million.  Last fiscal year their sales were 17-million.  (See Z-News 007, 103, 
201, 203, and 207 for earlier comments about Wyse.)

Where does money fit into our picture?  Let's briefly examine nature of money, 
and  its rightful place in the world.   Although money is vital to welfare  of 
all,  and is handled more frequently,  perhaps,  than any other thing on  this 
earth,  it is surprising how little we know of its true nature.  Money (force, 
energy)  is not the root of all evil or of evil only,  as some would have  you 
believe.   It is used for good as well as evil.   Some say money is the medium 
of  exchange--the  medium  through  which goods and  services  are  exchanged. 
Perfectly true, but there's much more.
     To understand the nature of money,  look at Life;  here 
is  the key:   money is medium through which time and effort 
(labor) are exchanged for time and effort.
     Our coin is energy!   Money is not material  substance.  
A short story:   You need something;  perhaps a house (worth 
more  than gold here in California) in which to  live.   You      sketch 
have  nothing but a few ill-groomed cows (you live  off-the-        of
land).   But who would give you a house for such?  Suddenly,    mad hatter
you get busy and care for these cows.   You clean them, feed       here
them,  milk them.  You breed them, and your herd multiplies.  
It takes effort and time to clean cattle, and to grow enough 
food for them.   You have to work hard at milking; then milk 
must be prepared for market and finally taken there,  all of 
which brings you MONEY.   You have some currency to show for 
all your sweat and work.  You keep taking milk to market and 
continue  to receive currency which you put away in  hidden, 
therefore secure-from-theft, place.
     As  soon as you have enough,  you take it to the man who spends his  time 
making houses.   This man draws plans,  then buys lumber,  tools, nails, etc., 
from  people  who spend their time and effort growing and  processing  lumber, 
mining  metal and planning and manufacturing tools and nails.   He takes  this 
material and puts it together,  making a house.  He trades time and effort for 
currency you gave him that you spent your time and effort acquiring.
     Money,  therefore, is tangible symbol of time spent in growing, creating, 
obtaining,  making,  or directing--effort of some kind.   Money is  solidified 
effort!   Thus,  effort  put forth may be frozen until such time as it becomes 
desirable  to  release  the effort.   Money frees  exchange  of  labor;  makes 
exchange convenient, efficient.  We reciprocate with money, each with time and 
effort  of equal value.   The usurer,  cheater,  robber,  and swindler  commit 
partial  murder  each time money,  merchandise,  or service is  taken  without 
giving part of their own lives in return.  Software rip-off (and other things) 
is suddenly seen in different light when nature of money is understood.

                               We See What Is,
                           Work ever for the Best,
                             Aware of the Worst,
                The while...LIVING each minute to its FULL...
                                Delaying not,
                        For yesterday has vanished and 
                          Tomorrow has yet dawned...
              THIS MINUTE is all of LIFE we ever truly possess.

He who exalts in being Alive for the sheer fun and joy of IT...FOR, his cup is 
full and runneth over!  See you down the lines...
