Anniversary  Price Reductions:  Z-News is one year old,  25 issues written and 
distributed.   To celebrate,  we lower prices on following items and offer new 
economy package situation:

  Item   New_Price      Description
  05.      $119.00      Z-Com (auto-install Z-System, with I/OP's, on
                        five/seven disks)
  20.        69.00      ZAS universal relocating macro assembler
  24.       150.00      Z-Tools (ZAS, ZDM, ITOZ and REVAS3)
  25.       129.95      DSD dynamic screen debugger
  40.        39.95      Input/Output Recorder (I/OR)
  43.        89.95      I/O Package Group (new), consisting of I/OR,
                        BPrinter and PKey
  60.        39.99      Discat ZCPR3 file and disk catalog program

The  cake is cut (see Z-News 205,  pg 3);  get your slice.   We said  we  were 
celebrating!
     Additionally,  ZAS  and ZDM have been upgraded to handle Hitachi  HD64180 
extended  instruction  set;   also  ZAS now has .phase/.dphase  and  many  new 
print/macro pseudo-ops.  (See function tables on pages 3 and 4.   These tables 
could  be  made into quickie HLP files integrated with other ZCPR3/ZRDOS  help 
menus.)   Anyone  wishing to upgrade,  please send your  original  disks,  and 
$20.00  each,  and we'll re-copy disks with new programs.   You  also  receive 
upgraded  manuals  reflecting changes.   For same price we will  upgrade  your 
ZRDOS to ZRDOS Plus--send us your disk.

Milestones!  ZCPR3:  The Manual is off-the-presses and starting to ship.   All 
who  have ordered should have received it by now,  or will within a week or so 
(we are now at mercy of US Postal Service).   The end of one saga and being of 
another.   ZCPR3  can be studied and understood like never before.   For  this 
7.5"  by  9.25" bound paper-back we have long  waited--it's  here!   We  thank 
everyone  for being civil when it would have been so easy not to be.   And the 
book is still only $19.95 plus shipping and handling of  $4.00.   Hurray!   We 
hope  ZCPR3:  The Libraries comes out when we first say it will (no ship  date 
yet, but when we give one it'll be a day we are certain of).
     ZRDOS  Plus is shipping,  in place of ZRDOS2.   Priced at $59.50,  $15.49 
less than ZRDOS2.   What's important:   it is re-entrant, permitting efficient 
I/O Packages to be written, so effective for 64k-byte Z80-based systems.
     Behold!   we add a spectacular utility, from gracious hands (and mind) of 
Dennis Wright,  to ZRDOS Plus utility collection.   Called VTYPE,  it  permits 
full  forward  and backward viewing of text files using screen  attributes  of 
your  terminal  and  efficient RAM-to-disk swap  buffers;  has  built-in,  in-
context,  help screen.   Scroll forward/backward,  line/screen at a  time;  go 
quickly  to beginning/end of file;  find text string;  repeat search;  top-of-
screen status line;  more!   It's one of those utilities, once you use it, you 
can't be without.   We think you too will be addicted after getting your hands 
on VTYPE.
     And,  Term3 (Phase 1) should be shipping during next fortnight!   Our cup
flows  over...we see high ground,  ground of Being!   Program Term3 has to  be
understood  as  same  kind  of departure-from-norm as  ZCPR3  did  from  CP/M.
Horizons  expand as you learn its vast capabilities.   If you assume you  know 
what it does, you learn little.

Z  TIPS:  A useful addition to your microcomputer support utilities  is  MAKE.
Moving  a program from one user area (0 to 31) to another is primary  feature.
Program simply changes file first-byte in directory area,  track two of disk--
doesn't actually copy to another directory.   Used in aliases it's possible to 
"move" a set of program overlays from directory to directory,  as needed,  for 
specific directory useage.   MAKE effectively satisfies requirement for public 
file  capability  (but  does  it  slower) and  makes  use  of  SETDRU  filters 
unnecessary,  in  those  situations where multiple copies of a  program  would 
otherwise  be  required on several directories.   If WS.COM and overlays  (and 
MAKE.COM)  were in user area 0,  disk drive A,  VFILER CMD command line  "MAKE 
WS*.COM  6;MAKE  *.OVR  6;WS %d%u:%f" puts them  in  user  area  6,  including 
MAILMERGE.OVR.  Now you can edit pointer file (%f) in user area 6.  Path finds 
MAKE and WS.COM and they have enough intelligence to find its overlays as long 
as  they  are in same user area and on same drive.   Pointer file could be  on 
default drive other than A.  (Short form for %d%u:%f in CMD files is %$.)
     Flash:  Dennis Wright has donated his personal ZCPR3 I/O debugger package 
to Z-Nodes.  Get IOBUG.LBR to see how Dennis works with I/O problems.

Amateur  Z  User's Corner:  We hope you have been learning  to  create  menus.
DEMO.LBR  is  on Z-Nodes to assist by showing many examples.   After going  to 
ZRDOS area of node, DEMO.LBR is found by entering command "FINDF DEMO.LBR<cr>" 
from  any  directory  you're in.   FINDF searches for file  (may  be  wildcard 
declared,  *.LBR finds all LBRs) in all directories.   When found,  you  enter 
directory  name,  a  colon,  and cursor (carriage) return,  and you're  there.
(Type "PWD<cr>" to determine directory name for Disk/User Area  combinations.)
Download  file  (use Christensen transfer protocol in your modem  program)  by 
entering command "XMODEM S DEMO.LBR<cr>" at Z-Node prompt.
     Set/reset meaning:   make expression (function or line) true,  one;  make 
false,  zero.   Raising a line,  e.g.,  DTR of RS-232 interface cable, sets it 
true,  a one,  turns function on.   True/false,  yes/no,  high/low,  one/zero, 
"1"/"0",  raise/lower, usually mean exactly the same thing.  Lowering a signal 
line sets it false, i.e., function is turned off, operation ceases.  Clear?
     Upload/download:   Up  and down are relative to perspective,  your mental 
perch,  where  you  are standing.   Public access message  and  file  transfer 
systems,  like Z-Nodes, are considered by convention higher in level (echelon) 
than individual computer systems.   So when placing files in such systems, you 
are  said to "upload";  getting files,  you "download."  Public access systems 
are  perceived as top-of-mountain,  we in valley!   We deal with  pure  mental 
gymnastics, but still important for understanding.
     Construction:   those  wishing  to build an SBC or S-100 computer  should 
contact Integrand, 8620 Roosevelt Ave.,  Visalia,  CA 93291, 209/651-1203, for 
their catalog of enclosure,  fan,  power supply,  connector,  and  motherboard 
products.   Integrand  has much advice/hardware for such projects.  Also DISKS 
PLUS (15945 West Pope Blvd.,  Prairie View, IL 60069, 312/537-7888) is another 
excellent source of hard-to-find pieces for a build-a-computer project.  Order 
their catalog to feast on choice morsels.

Floppy  Disk  Format  Standard Proposed!  Suggested standard  for  5.25"  disk 
formats used by 8-bit machines:   single and double-sided,  double-density, 40 
and 80 track formats perfected by Alpha Systems (San Jose,  CA) and first used 
by  Ampro  Computers (Mountain View,  CA),  then by Oneac  (Chicago,  IL)  and 
Micromint  (Vernon,  CT);  and expanded usage now encouraged by  Echelon.   We 
already  have one 8" standard,  IBM  3740,  for  single-sided,  single-density 
disks.   California Computer Systems (CCS) and CompuPro (Viasyn) single-sided, 
double-density, 600k-byte, is suggested as another; and CompuPro double-sided, 
double-density,  1.2  megabyte,  is also.   Micromint BIOS for SB180  supports 
these three 8" formats.  We have no axe-to-grind other than to attempt to stop 
proliferation of additional formats--microcomputer community needs no more!

Z-Node  Corner:  Node operations smooth.   We consolidate,  preparing for full 
data-link satellite relay function.   Bob Finch and Al Hawley,  Z-Node Sysops, 
rush   in   their   labors   of   love   to   complete   design   of    global 
message/communications system.

SB180/MOSART:  Xecom (374 Turquoise St.,  Milpitas,  CA  95035,  408/943-0313) 
XE1201/XE1203  modem components (hybrid module,  using only 2.25 square inches 
of printed circuit board area) open next generation telephone communications--
voice  and data,  over same wireline,  conveniently controlled by  menu-driven 
software.
     The Micromint SB180 single board computer (see Z-News 109/204/206)  using 
its  auxiliary communications board,  called COMM180 (with XE1201/03 element), 
form  basis of turn-key,  stand-alone bulletin board  system  (BBS).   COMM180 
board is approximately 2.75" by 4.5" in area, and designed to sell for $399.00 
with  software.   Term3 is being customized to permit user to take significant 
advantage  of hybrid modem module.   Also,  Z-Msg is being upgraded  to  honor 
entry  into  this new modem/communications epoch.   Hardware and software  are 
completely  integrated;   here  is  plug-in-wall  (AC,   console,   and  phone 
connections),   ready-to-run  package,   for  computer  professionals  wanting 
unattended file and message handling capability, as well as normal computing.
     Echelon  Z-Team  members Richard Conn,  Tim Gary,  and David  McCord  are 
handling software design and integration tasks.   Who could be more qualified?
Complete package sells for $1400.00, in portable metal case, with two 80-track 
5.25"  floppies.   Expansion  to  hard  disk  occurs  with  built-in  parallel 
expansion bus (SCSI interface).
     Call-progress monitoring through switched network telephone systems is  a 
feature beyond standard-Hayes operation.   Dial tone received,  busy, ringing, 
receiver  off-hook,  voice,  ring-back,  timeout,  answer  (connect),  reorder 
(circuit/equipment  not ready/available),  vacant (number  unassigned),  i.e., 
comprehensive  monitoring!   Xecom modem module does what we had hoped defunct 
PMMI 1200 bps modem was to have done.  (Craig Brown, you still around?)  Also, 
software  controlled voice interface,  telephone line  diagnostics,  and  DTMF 
signaling  (using tones to directly receive commands/data) and optional speech 
synthesis are available.
     Four  before-end-of-calendar-year BYTE magazine articles  describe  SB180 
and  its  software,  plus  Xecom  MOSART modem  module  and  COMM180  bulletin 
board/communications package.  Action starts on cover of 10th Anniversary BYTE 
issue.

Ramblings:   Hope  Hitachi calls their HD64180 microprocessor H180 (Z180  name 
also  would be nice).   Chip is cross between Zilog Z80 and Intel  80186;  180 
implies extended 80 in 188/186 vain.  So either Z180 or H180 name seems right, 
appropriate.
     Wyse Technology (3571 N.  First St.,  San Jose,  CA 95134,  408/433-1000) 
lowers WY-50 ternimal retail price to $599.00 from $695.00.  President Bernard 
Tse, stay number one, please.  Quality lives on, after price is forgotten--hot 
tip of the fortnight!
     While  we think Assembly Language is best,  we still promote  C  Language 
here  and there,  especially if optimized (like in Z-Msg).   Thus we  announce 
Computer  Language  magazine (131 Townsend Street,  San Francisco,  CA  94107, 
415/957-9353)  sponsors a workshop on it,  with renown experts conducting  the 
sessions.   Workshop is scheduled for 16,  17, 18 September 1985 in Cambridge, 
MA.  Call CL if you wish to attend.
     Studying  Artificial  Intelligence (AI)  is  scientific,  spiritual,  and 
mystical,  all  at  once.   The  fact back in 1955 such  subject  was  labeled 
"artificial"  and  the name stuck says something about  "Catch-22"  aspect  of 
investigator  investigating  himself--man studying man,  expecting  to  unfold 
something unknowable about himself.  AI reminds us of "a hand drawing itself," 
so skillfully depicted by artist Maurice Escher (of GEB book fame,  written by 
Douglas Hofstader), a spiral of recursion, leaping from one octave to another, 
never  to exactly repeat.   Ignorance in action is frightening to behold (also 
potentially very dangerous)!  Z you down the lines...
