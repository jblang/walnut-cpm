                                  Z-NEWS 406

New  Products  Update.    We run from 6 to 10 weeks behind  our  original  new
product development schedule (Z-News 401), were delayed mainly by graphics and 
Term3,  Release 2, packages--but, now they are finished.  Hurray!  So,  on  to 
the  other  equally important stuff:  ZCPR33, ZCPR/S3, ZCPR/B3,  ZCPR/M3,  and 
ZRDOS3.   Look  for  3.3 by end of April, rest  by,  hopefully,  beginning  of 
summer--June  1st.  B3 and M3 along with ZRDOS3 usher in a new era  for  high-
performance  8-bit systems.  CP/M is dead--long live Z!  Wide and  local  area 
networking  with  E-Mail,  multi-tasking,  graphics,  flexibility,  speed  and 
efficiency, these are features of Z-System.

ZCPR3:  The Libraries.   Robert Blum (Norcross, GA), erstwhile CP/M  columnist 
of Dr. Dobb's Journal and now columnist for Micro/Systems Journal,  graciously 
consents  to  write FOREWORD to next edition of The Libraries.   We  felt  Bob 
ideal, as he so loves to use previous SYSLIB versions.  (Look for FOREWORD  on 
Z-Nodes as file FOREWORD.RB.)
     As  you  may guess, we are proud of The Libraries.  Nothing  we  know  of 
compares to it regarding assembly language programming, that programming we so 
love.   In  addition to explaining programming philosophy, what  each  routine 
does,  and how each routine is used, nine (9) example programs really  promote 
quick  learning, show structure-technique of assembly language program  design 
and  coding using REL libraries.  The Libraries, SYSLIB, Z3LIB, and VLIB,  are 
premier tools to efficiently control microcomputer tasks, and provide much  of 
the abstraction of Pascal and C languages but without poor code density.
     Here's  way  to  learn programming by  trial  and  self-correction.   You 
learned  to  walk that way, not through instruction from  your  parents.   The 
idea:  try, try, try...never think of lack of success as failure...your  self-
worth  is increased by trying, followed by being able to keep up with  change, 
thus  changing yourself, your world.  Book creates environment  for  learning.
It  promotes learning-oriented, in addition to  less-important  goal-oriented, 
programming activity.
      Book,  with  huge Table of Contents and Index--likes of  which  we  have 
never  seen  before--sells for only $29.95 plus $4.00  S&H,  continental  USA.
Contains  310 loose-leaf pages in big and tan, plastic and indestructible,  3-
ring binder.  Need we say more?

Z-Node  Activity.   The beat goes on!  Zee Tall Trees Z-Node is online  and  a 
downloader of our proprietary software.  Sysop Bob Peddicord, Selam OR, is  no 
stranger  to  community,  being author of TALIAS.  Bob is  in  evergreen  tree 
country and becomes node #60 with 503/597-2066 modem phone number.  Welcome to 
the ever growing z-noder group, Bob.  Each willing to provide emotion, feeling 
is welcomed to the list.
     To  cover  western  side of Missouri and eastern  Kansas,  Gregg  Britton 
becomes  Z-Node #61 with 30 megabyte hard disk on Heath H89.   Gregg  operates 
from  Whiteman  Air Force Base, MO 65305, an area with  little  RAS  activity.
With Gregg's enthusiasm that situation soon changes.
     Another down-under Z-Node now online, #62, is run by Sysop Lindsay Allen, 
Perth, Western Australia, 6153, 61-9-364-9924 on a Morrow.  He is also a  ham, 
VK6LJ call letters, and an airline pilot.  Welcome aboard, Lindsay.

     Michael Breaux, Poway (San Diego), CA 92064, 619/486-0735, becomes  Sysop 
of  Z-Node  #63.  He runs a CompuPro 6-mHz Z80 and has  80  megabytes  storage 
online.   Here's  much-needed  addition to assist  Roger  Warren,  Z-Node  #9, 
619/270-3148, with southern California traffic.
     Edward Mecka, Hoboken, NJ 07030, 201/798-0065, Z-Node Node #64, starts to 
handle east coast Z traffic.
     And--that's makes it 7 new nodes for this fortnight--thirty megabytes  of 
storage online comes to us from Laurence Langer and his modified Kaypro.  Node 
is  based  in cowboy country, Cheyenne, WY 82001,  307/635-8366.   Z-Node  #65 
mixes it up for you guys tired of punching doggies.
     From Steve Kitahata, Z-Node #57, Gardena, CA, 213/532-3336, comes, "...by 
becoming  a  Z-Node  and making my own contributions, I hope to  help  you  in 
supporting the most powerful operating system written for microcomputers,  bar 
none!"  Thanks, Steve, for recognizing something we have been telling of for a 
long time.
     Our between Dallas and Fort Worth node (Bedford, TX) signs as  downloader 
of EI proprietary software.  Terry Carroll, Z-Node #56 Sysop, 817/283-9167, is 
ready to sell you what you want.  Give him a try.
     Bob Finch, ham radio packet to Z-Node #21, is soon ready to connect phone 
line to his RAS.  Then the fun begins!

Amateur Z User Corner.   Our communications menu evolves as we gain experience 
using  Term3  software  system, modem wide and RS-232 (and  SCSI)  local  area 
networks.   Single  menu  below  can be expanded  to  control  everything  you 
normally do with your computer.  Many more screens, up to 255, are  controlled 
from  this  single top view.  You can use up to 36  single-keystroke  commands 
from each screen, several on each screen-line, not one or two as we show here. 
We  try  for  menu-display distinctiveness (using ^A and ^B  codes  for  line, 
phrase, word, and character highlighting) and ease of use, clarity along  with 
functionally.   (Can  you imagine boxes and windows applied to a  menu  screen 
like this?)  Setting System File to name of menu permits going back and  forth 
from  editor  to  screen,  interactively  developing  menu--demonstration   of 
recursion!

     Our  system  disk,  disk  A,  named  directories  are:  A0=ROOT,  A8=CAT, 
A12=HELP,  A14=TERM3; and A15=ROOT.  Most work is on disk B and D, backups  go 
to floppy disk C.  Notice we sometimes log-into the directory and other  times 
not,  depending on needs that get job done quickly and efficiently.  From  the 
menu,  we  can  get  to Discat Master Catalog,  use  VFILER,  and  by  setting 
filename,  use  Newword (or any other editor or word processor)  to  edit  any 
filename  known  to be in current directory.  We typically use  a  VFILER  CMD 
macro to go to MAIL directory from any location on disk system.  Macro line is 
simple:

7 MAIL:;ROOT:setfile 1 t3.mnu;ROOT:menu t3.mnu;%d%u:

Here, 1) we log into B7:MAIL> directory, 2) set System File #1 to name of menu 
(we  continue  to  work on communications menu, better  to  serve  our  mutual 
needs),  3)  run  MENU,  then after leaving menu with  ^C  we,  4)  return  to 
directory  from  which we called VFILER macro command.  B7: is used  only  for 
mail and files, received either locally or from Z-Nodes and other RASs.
     You  may wish to use VMENU instead of MENU for your communications  menu.
Each  program  has  its advantages and  disadvantages.   Although  at  present 
program version levels, to have 16 pointer file names displayed with VMENU you 
give  up only six (6) lines (16 total, versus 22 for MENU) that could be  used 
as text and commands in menu screen--not much of a trade-off!  Having  ability 
to  use both System Files and Pointer Files is fun (fulfilling).  Review  file 
S.VMN in DEMO.LBR.  Therein VMENU power shows.
     We use recursion, procedures that repeat (use) themselves indefinitely or 
until  a  specific condition is met, with reverence.   Why?   It's  catalytic, 
stimulates learning.  And that's what Echelon is about and... 

Of  Cabbages  and Kings.   Something-for-nothing!  Where  did  such  misunder-
standing  come  from?   To  become more than what  we  are,  individually  and 
collectively,  requires  effort, work on the physical, the  intellectual,  the 
emotional,  on  the Being.  Anything coming easy, needing little  or  no  work 
doesn't alter the status quo, the balanced forces of stability.  Change  comes 
from conscious effort, resulting in new structure.  Majority of us  understand 
not  the  path,  way  to  fun.  We  WONDER  not,  seem  to  be  insufficiently 
knowledgeable or wise...now back to Zinfandel, and a light head.  See you down 
the lines...
