Z TIPS:  Here we go again!   Howard Cripe has created an alias support program 
that  permits  using your favorite editor to write aliases.   Each  individual 
command  is entered followed by a carriage return;  later processing  converts 
these  returns to semicolons,  the ZCPR3 command separators,  with line  feeds 
ignored.   Then  after  exiting your editor,  file produced  is  processed  by 
Howard's ACREATE.COM using command:  

       ACREATE <editor-created text file name> <to-be alias file name>

An  alias  COM  file is thus produced,  ready to  run.   Another  file  called 
ALIAS.MAS (should be on default drive along with ACRRATE.COM) is automatically 
used  to  make final runnable alias.   But first,  ALIAS.MAS must be  one-time 
installed to your SYS.ENV file using Z3INS, Version 1.2 or later; else use ZDM 
(or  DDT) to patch environment base-page address (found using SHOW  or  Z3LOC) 
into  MAS  location 10A hex (then SAVE 4 ALIAS.MAS).   Thanks for  your  work, 
Howard; Z community is grateful!
     We  suggested awhile ago that someone put a character/command editor into 
ALIAS.COM,  so re-doing the entire alias script wouldn't be required for  each 
little  change.   Howard did the next best thing in developing ACREATE--now we 
wait in diminished pain for that internal editor.  You who complete it, please 
call the program MKALIAS, name goes nicely with MKDIR.
     Author of ZCPR3, Richard Conn, is updating SAK (strike-any-key) to permit 
operator to cancel with ^C while within Zex batch command files.  Presently ^C 
drops you to next Zex command line.   Other than in Zex files,  SAK now  works 
perfectly  in straight commands,  in menus,  and in aliases.   Soon it'll work 
perfectly, period!
     Robert Greenlee recently developed a patch for Z-System ZEX batch program 
to permit running with XtraKey and XScreen.  Those using these programs and Z3 
should get patch documentation from Z-Nodes (file ZEXPTCH2.DQC), or write/call 
Bob at Xpert Systems, 8865 Polland Avenue, San Diego, CA 92123, 619/268-0112.
     Kaypro  and  ZCPR3 user,  Fred Lieberman (Santa Cruz,  CA) thought  of  a 
machine  specific alias we pass to you.   He called it BYE,  the last  command 
given as his computer power is turned off.   CLEANDIR;ECHO TURN OFF MODEM  AND 
PRINTER;SAFTEY.   That's  it.   CLEANDIR keeps the directory tidy for possible 
UNERASE  use;  message is shown to remind to turn off hardware;  SAFTEY  is  a 
Kaypro  program  positioning  hard disk head to safe location  for  physically 
moving computer, intentionally or accidently.

ECHELON  PRODUCT DELIVERY STATUS:   ZCPR3:  The Manual     Mr.  James  Monaco, 
President of New York ZOETROPE,  publisher of the "book," has personally given 
us  a delivery date--21 June,  if no further problems  develop!   Echelon  has 
arranged  to have the manual dropped shipped by publisher to each customer  in 
interest  of  quickest  delivery after  off-the-press  has  occurred.   Delays 
getting  this  book to our customers has caused some ill-will,  we  know;  but 
please hang-in with us--the book is worth it!
     ZRDOS2/Z-Com2     Problems in software design has lead to much delays  in 
project.   Presently  we  change  specification of  these  packages.   Meeting 
original  specification placed program into "too big" category for  Z80's  and 
64k-byte  memory  spaces.   So Version 2 is being reserved for  HD64180's  and 
Z800's,  schedule not yet determined.  For those who ordered ZRDOS2/Z-Com2, we 
will  supply  ZRDOS/Z-Com  Plus,  similar to ZRDOS1 and Z-Com  but  with  full 
single-level  re-entrance.   I/O Packages such as I/OR and BPrinter work  with 
Plus.   Re-entrance results in very compact code for I/O tasks.  It's the best 
we can do for Z80-based 64k-byte machines.
     Term3     Deep in beta testing,  Term3 should be shipping soon, hopefully 
in a month or less!  Program is modular, uses ZCPR3 facilities fully, replaces 
BYE  (public  domain  automatic phone answering program used  by  most  remote 
bulletin  board  systems),  and mates hand-in-glove with  Z-Msg  (Metal).   Of 
course, it handles all your communications needs as well.  Having features and 
possibilities  not  previously found in any such programs,  first  version  is 
shipped  with letter thanking everyone for their extreme patience and offering 
free upgrade to planned second (and final) version.   (DEMO.MNU,  in  DEMO.LBR 
mentioned  above,  contains  a  few  useful Term3 command  macros  in  special 
Communications Menu--a beginning.)

SB-180  Update:  Single board computer using Hitachi HD64180 and  Z-System  is 
physically  sized at 4" by 7" to mount on side of 5.25" and 3.5 floppy drives. 
Shipments start first week of August 1985!  Price:  fully assembled and tested 
board  with ready-to-boot operating system and other software bundled on  four 
double-sided,  double density disks is $499.00.  Price includes SuperBIOS with 
192k-byte auto-RAM disk,  MOVZ,  SYSGEN, CONFIG, FCV, ZCPR3, ZRDOS, EDIT, ZDM, 
and  ZAS.   Same without OS software but with SuperBIOS is  $359.00;  software 
alone is priced at $190.00.   An ancillary board is being developed containing 
a full 300/1200 bps modem plus other functions;  more details in a month.   To 
order  or for more details,  call or write Micromint Inc.,  25 Terrace  Drive, 
Vernon,  CT 06066,  toll-free telephone 1-800-635-3355.   (See Z-News 109  for 
further SB-180 specifications, 105 and 107 for early benchmarks.)

Milestone  Achieved:   Lots of folks haven't worked with Z-System  menus.   To 
assist  getting  started  Echelon  staff has developed  an  extensive  set  of 
coordinated, chained menu scripts (text files) and display screens using MENU, 
VMENU,  and VFILER.  Menu methodology is explained in a lengthy DOC file--much 
caring  went  into menu project.   Since Z is the definitive  8-bit  operating 
system  and so few seem to understand it,  we thought it worth expending  such 
energy.   Stated another way,  we know of no system that permits production of 
menus  and covers range of task automation as easily and as efficiently as  Z. 
(Similar  menus are used to impress OEM's potentially interested in  using  Z-
System, instead of using more expensive, less powerful software.)
     Novice  computer users may be shielded completely from learning  Z-System 
commands;   experienced  user's  find  convenience  and  task  speed  up;  and 
consultants find organizational power important.
     Fruits of our work are in file DEMO.LBR on Z-Nodes; download, study, use; 
then, write us what you think.  Let's see your menu (and alias) examples!  Our 
menu  offering  is for a 3-drive system;  if you do one for two (2) drives  we 
would especially appreciate seeing your work.
     While on subject of menus and screens, one of our customers, Fred Haines, 
in the movie business,  has automated screenplay writing and management  using 
Z-System  menus.   If interested in movie script control,  contact him at  733 
North King's Road #331,  Los Angeles,  CA 90069, 213/658-8664.  Work is called 
Speedball Movie Maker.  Fred uses a Morrow MD3 for computer activities and one 
of  his  beta-tester  software  friends has planned an article  about  it  for 
Writer's Guild newsletter.  Z goes Hollywood!

Amateur_Z_User's_Corner:   ZCPR3 has no direct file move command,  but CP  and 
MCOPY are there for file coping.   (ZRDOS's AC command with trailing E  option 
is an effective file mover.)  Lacking ZRDOS,  a simple alias,  call it MV,  is 
created  to move files from one directory to another:   MCOPY $1=$2 Q;ERASE $2 
R;ECHO FILE(S) MOVED:  $2.   Because versatile transients MCOPY and ERASE  are 
available  and  used  here,  $2 may be wild-card declared,  and  with  several 
filenames  separated  by  commas.   Syntax is similar  to  normal  copying  or 
renaming, except "space" delimiter is used instead of "=" sign:

    B0:WORK1><MV> <directory to move to> [DIR:]<fn.ft>[,fn2.ft2][,*.ft3]<cr>
              mv            $1                   $2

Legend:   < > = required operator entry,  [ ] = optional; fn = filename, up to 
eight  characters;  ft = filetype,  optionally up to 3 characters;  and,  *  = 
matches  any set of characters,  one of two OS file-search wildcards (other is 
"?"  which matches any single character);  $1 = first parameter  passed  after 
command name,  $2 = second;  <cr> = RETURN, ENTER, DO, etc., keypress.  Either 
DIR or DU directory forms may be used.  Conditional testing (using resident IF 
or  transient  IF12)  for  existence of  files  or  directories--canceling  or 
displaying message if not--could be added. 
     Microcomputer technical jargon is no more difficult to learn than that of 
other professions,  e.g.,  medical or botanical.   Jargon develops as means to 
more  efficiently  communicate:   one  word may represent a  complete  concept 
greatly  increasing  speed  and ease  of  human  interactions.   But  everyone 
involved  must  understand language used;  so let's get to meaning  of  seldom 
defined command line tails,  trailing parameters, variables and arguments, and 
expressions like "passing."  We already have an mental image of shells as used 
in  ZCPR3  context  (read Z-News 203,  page  one,  if  you  don't).   Mentally 
differentiate  between  file  scripts entered with editor  and  command  lines 
entered at OS prompt.  Definitions by examples:

  ECHO THIS IS A TEST.   - "THIS IS A TEST." is command tail passed to
                           program ECHO to display on terminal.  Moving
                           data from one memory area to another is called
                           "passing."
  $f, $n, $t, %f, %n, %t - These are script variables used to indicate
                           whether full fn.ft, or fn or ft is to be expanded,
                           passed and further processed.  Used in shells.
  $0, $1, $2, $3         - Script parameters, expanded (resolved) name passed
                           from command line to program, shell, or alias.
                           May be filenames or trailing options (arguments).
  WS fn.ft               - "fn.ft" is command tail for WordStar, file to edit.
  PRINT fn.ft e          - "fn.ft e" is command tail for command PRINT.  "e"
                           is called trailing option of command.

FLASH!   Quadram Corporation (4355 International Blvd.,  Norcross,  GA  30093, 
404/923-6666) soon comes out of beta testing with full-up,  ready-to-boot from 
either 5.25" or 8" disk,  S-100 bus single board computer.  Board uses Hitachi 
super  HD64180 8-bit computer chip,  and contains 512k-bytes of RAM along with 
floppy  and hard disk controllers,  one parallel and two  serial  ports.   Old 
timers  have been waiting for this,  as we have.   Look for it being ready for 
sale  in July or early August!   (Further good news:   Zilog Z800 chip is  not 
dead;  it's coming but we won't say when!   Samples,  with blemishes,  are  in 
hands  of  selected  potential volume-user manufacturers.)  Our faith  in  and 
support for 8-bit processors is slowly being materially justified.

Industry  Brief:  You know what IBM did to PCjr--they stopped  production  and 
it's essentially an orphan.   Well,  PC2 is soon (in six months, more or less) 
to come out. and guess what?  Machine that's sold in millions is now to become 
an orphan!  That's Life?  We write and speak no more of IBM (or DRI).

Fears  Stifle  Our Creativity:  We simply hate to make mistakes,  but also  we 
fear  being  seen a fool,  being criticized by our  peers,  being  mislead  or 
misused  by  others.   We fear standing alone with no one at  our  side,  fear 
disturbing  traditions  or breaking taboos,  not having the security of  habit 
patterns, losing attention and love of our work and social groups; and most of 
all,  we truly fear being an individual.   Yet,  we claim being individual  is 
unique, blessed strength of being human!
