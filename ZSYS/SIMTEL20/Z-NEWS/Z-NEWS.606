Of  Significance.   Interested in studying about Modula-2  computer  language?
Rea   Williams,  Z-Node  #10  Sysop,  recommends  two  books:  "MODULA-2,   An 
Introduction,"  written by Daniel Thalmann and published  by  Springer-Verlag, 
Berlin,  West Germany (publisher used by Pascal and Modula-2  author,  Niklaus 
Wirth).  Also, "MODULA-2, A Seafarer's Guide and Shipyard Manual," written  by 
Edward  J. Joyce, published by Addison-Wesley (Reading, MA).  Along with  552-
page  bound "User's Guide and Reference Manual," written by  Borland,  jointly 
published by Micromint and Echelon, and comes with Z80 Turbo Modula-2 package, 
we have enough documentation to keep us reading for a long time to come.
     Those  who  already  know and use Turbo  Pascal  have  little  difficulty 
switching over to Turbo Modula-2.  Those who have not learned BASIC or  Pascal 
will  find Modula-2 just as easy to learn as either.  And our manual  compares 
features of Turbo Pascal and Turbo Modula-2.  So, knowing Pascal, it's easy to 
understand  the  difference.   Z-News 604 and file  MODULA2.RAS  provide  more 
details.

     Earth's  Winter Solstice and Christmas are near...time for giving,  among 
other things...make giving magical by a gift of DSD, Dynamic Screen  Debugger, 
to  your hacker friend; if you wish you were a hacker, yield to similar  magic 
and  give yourself REVAS.  If you are not into Assembler, then Turbo  Modula-2 
is your way to go.  If you want your Z-System upgraded, give yourself  latest-
release  ZRDOS, Version 1.7.  If you are into ROM real-time code at your  job, 
ask  your  boss  to buy Quick-Task to speed your work.  And,  if  you  haven't 
already, now is the time to renew your subscription to Z-News (don't forget to 
order Z-Index when you do).

From  Our  Mail  Box.   "Does the purchase of Software  Update  Service  [SUS] 
qualify  for a six-month extension of Z-News?  And...finally, I must put in  a 
word  of thanks to all of you 'Z-Folks'!  Computing is much more fun now  than 
before.   VFILER  and VMENU continue to amaze me.  In my spare  moments  I  am 
exploring the power of ZEX and delving into the many useful components of  the 
Z-System.   It  is  exciting because, while there is  a  whole  'universe'  of 
learning ahead, what I am doing now is already useful in my work.  Thanks  for 
all  of  your good work!"  Rev. David Templin,  Pastor,  Trinity  Presbyterian 
Church, West Sacramento, CA, does work of his Lord and finds time to do  more.
Rev.  Templin, our Z-News renewal policy is stated in Z-News 604-4.   Get-you-
started,  six-months gratuity is one-time.  You know, when work is thought  of 
(as  Third Force, Z-News 303-3, 306-5) in broad terms, we are all in the  same 
"business."

Description  of Micromint's new SB180FX single-board computer is contained  in 
file SB180FX.RZS.  MODULA2.RAS is Echelon's advertisement for Turbo  Modula-2; 
we  look for dealers.  Please upload MODULA2.RAS to your local RAS, if  it  is 
not  already  there.   Thanks.   FMANAGER.LBR  and  SETFMANG.LBR  contain  Bob 
Peddicord's  file  and  menu manager system.  See  Z-Node  Corner  below.   By 
invoking tpa<cr> you know size of your Transient Program Area.  VFILER.CMD  is 
our latest general purpose CMD script.  Change it to suit your needs.

Z-User's Corner.   With all the talk and activity concerning file compression, 
we  thought it a good idea to discuss VFILER CMD script lines used  to  handle 
squeezing  and  crunching.   Until such popular utilities,  NULU,  VTYPE,  and 
VFILER  get upgraded to handle compressing/uncompressing both, below lines  do 
(we use patched SYSFCP.ASM as shown in Z-News 508-2):

 s!%d%u:;echo squeeze (y) or crunch (n) file? ;if in;sq %f;else;     <<
   crunch %f;fi;%h:
 u!%d%u:;if %t=?q?;uf %f;else;if %t=?z?;uncr %f;else;                <<
   echo not compressed file ;fi;fi;%h:

Using VFILER, Version 4.1h or 4.2b, and its ability to handle both numbers and 
letters  for  user-defined  macro  commands,  we  have  lots  of  CMD   script 
flexibility.   "S"  for squeezing and crunching--you are prompted  for  which.
You respond with "y" if you wish to squeeze and "n" if crunch is wanted.   "U" 
for unsqueezing and uncrunching, either one automatically, by system  checking 
for either Q or Z as file-type second character.
     Instead  of USQ, we use UF, Version 2.0, for unsqueezing because  of  its 
quickness.   It's on SUS #3.  SQ is Version 1.11 on SUS #2.  CRUNCH  and  UNCR 
are Version 2.2, on SUS #7 and, of course, on Z-Nodes.
     We  walk through "S" macro first.  After entering lead-in <esc>  followed 
by  "s" characters (lead-in is needed if on "Files" side of VFILER,  not  from 
"#"  side),  program logs current drive as default, "%d%u:", and  prompts  you 
with  echo  message.  After responding with either "y" or "n",  file  "%f"  is 
either squeezed or crunched.  Home directory (the directory from which  VFILER 
was  entered)  is  again made default.  Program remembers  not  to  return  to 
VFILER,  a result of the "!" placed after the command letter, until a  key  is 
entered in response to "Strike Any Key" prompt.
     Now "U" macro is traversed.  Logs current as default, tests file type for 
second  character;  if "q", then unsqueezes.  Or if second character  is  "z", 
uncrunching  occurs.   Then shows "Strike Any Key" prompt after  1)  finishing 
uncompression  or  2) showing "not compresed file" error message  if  file  is 
neither squeezed nor crunched.
     Variations  using  extended  features of IF.COM, Version  1.4  (SUS  #2), 
produce  similar execution.  Prompts are handled differently; overall  results 
are the same.  Use one of below lines for compressing files if you are unable, 
or do not want, to patch SYSFCP.ASM as suggested in Z-News 508.

 s!%d%u:;if xn crunch;crunch %f;else;echo;if xn squeeze;sq %f;fi;fi;%h:

 s!%d%u:;if xn crunch (y) or squeeze (n) file (y/n)? ;crunch %f;          <<
   else;sq %f;fi;%h:

     All  utility  files used above are in A15:ROOT  directory  along  command 
search  path.   See  ZCPR3: The Manual, pages 153 through  160,  and  Z-System 
User's  Guide, pages 6-16 through 6-18, for more on using VFILER and  creating 
CMD script.

Z-Node Activity.   Bob Peddicord, Z-Node #60 Sysop, Selma, OR, writes programs 
when  RAS  doesn't  require his attention.  He creates file  and  menu  super-
utility  named FMANAGER (on SUS #7).  Based on Richard Conn's original  VMENU, 
he takes his program in direction he thinks our community wants.  Keep up  the 
good work, Bob.  VMENU remains "simple," as one of our menu handling programs.

Lunch Break.   Dion Vaughn, President of Magnum Digital, manufacturer of  PRO-
180  with  Z-System for S-100 bus machines (Z-News 306-5,  308-1),  writes  an 
article  discussing  several  methods of implementing  32-bit  S-100  systems, 
recommends  one.  Piece is in expanded Vol.1, No.4 of S-100 Journal.   If  you 
want to know more, contact Jay Vilhena, Editor, S-100 Journal, P.O. Box  1914, 
Orem, UT, telephone 801/373-0696.
     Z-News  605-1  provides  names  and  addresses  of  three  CP/M  software 
distributors.  Here is another:  Dynacomp, Inc., P.O. Box 18129, Rochester, NY 
14618.  They claim to have the largest selection of software available for  8-
bit CP/M-compatible machines.  Write for their free 200-page catalog.

In  Other  Words.    We  understand  U.S.  Government  investigates  potential 
ramifications  of  Fujitsu taking over 80% of Fairchild  Semiconductor.   What 
next?   A  second  round of protectionist legislation--the  first  was  "anti-
dumping."   Nothing  but a disaster!  Restraint-of-trade only leads  to  lower 
standard of living for majority of us.
     Does anyone really think bureaucrats in Washington know how to run  free-
enterprise businesses?  We don't.  They spend money, money not belonging to us 
or  them, money they borrow, like drunken sailors on a week-end  binge  before 
shipping  out.   Such people are addicted to reacting without  having  to  pay 
consequences.   Incentives to be responsible don't exist in huge  bureaucratic 
governments and companies...
     Two  years ago we critisized MCC, Microelectronics & Computer  Technology 
Corp., in Austin, TX (Z-News 009-7, 11/12/84).  Now, it seems several  charter 
members are leaving the consortium.  But hold onto to your hats.  To  counter, 
MCC management seeks as members other than U.S. companies, to permit  Japanese 
companies to enter as replacements to U.S. companies vacating.  "...a mass  of 
indirection,  no  willfulness, no leadership! ...Japanese  noble-challenge  to 
U.S.  technology leadership requires our ascending effort, not  descending..."
Will we never learn!  What has the consortium produced in its near three-years 
of existence?  Joining MCC costs a corporation one-million dollars.  "What  is 
bred  in  the  bone comes out in the flesh," advises an old  proverb.   If  we 
cannot  be sufficiently imaginative, productive in our  respective  companies, 
why would a consortium be better?
     Where  is Yankee determination to excel, to be best, to be  champions  of 
open  competition?  How can we allow our economic life-death competitors,  the 
Japanese, into MCC consortium?  Who speaks for us, for Earth's future?
     ====================================================================
Of Angels and Eagles.   The United States of America is now the largest debtor 
nation  in  the world.  We owe more money than either Brazil or  Mexico.   Our 
imbalance of trade is highlighted in year 1986 by us buying $170 billion  more 
imports  than we export.  Our national fiscal budget is not balanced--we  live 
on  borrowed  time--spending  over $200-billion more per  year  than  received 
through taxation.  Debt is our engine!
     Mid-term  elections  are over but we didn't hear one  candidate--no,  not 
one--address U.S. competitiveness, neither the President nor any Congressional 
or  State  candidates.   When do we build a manufacturing base  that  sees  us 
successfully  into  the future?  Manufactured products lead  to  research  and 
development  which  lead  to engineering which  leads  to  manufacturing  more 
products--a neat closed loop.
     Art is triumph over chaos.  When do we celebrate our success over  chaos?
When we put art back into our country, into our psyche.  That is when!

                      Moments in which we are conscious
                                   make It,
                                the struggle,
                                 worthwhile.

     We  are  accused  of being partial, i.e., having bias,  in  our  drinking 
habits.   No,  not  true.  We like Lynchburg Lemonade  (Jack  Daniels  Bourbon 
Whiskey) and Colorado Coolaid (Coors Banquet Beer), in addition to two flavors 
of Zinfandel (native red and white California Wine).  We also like Tea  brewed 
from  hibiscus flowers, roasted chicory root, orange peel, blackberry  leaves, 
and  lemon  grass.  But we don't forget that "los que toman  vino  viven  cien 
anos," or more.  See you down the lines...
