Z  Tips.    Thanks  to you who have subscribed or  have  renewed  to  hardcopy 
version of Z-News.  We appreciate your continuing support.
     Z-Index, massive index to Z-News is shipping.  Those who renew newsletter 
subscription receive it free.  To other we offer it for $8.95.
     Notice  Alias,  Vfiler  and Arunz CMD, Menu MNU, and  Vmenu  VMN  process 
command  lines  after all prompts, if any, have  received  operator  response.
Therein  establishes  major virtue of GETVAR and RESOLVE.   Commands  may  run 
before  prompts are output to operator for responses!  Such  tools  complement
our  others to satisfy needs of "turn-key" menu systems.  GH alias  of  Z-News 
507  and GLF below could only be created using this tool duo.   Neither  Alias 
nor  Arunz have facility to run commands, prompt operator, then run more  com-
mands based upon operator's response.
     Dennis Wright has finished AC, Version 3.9, and hopefully it solves  some 
problems  some  have  had  with archiving files.  We include  it  in  file  of 
aliases, ALIAS#1.LBR, as convenience.
     Don't forget, if you need to add line numbers to a text print-out,  PRINT 
does  this  plus  can add left margin offset, custom file  headers,  and  most 
importantly,  wrap  lines  that are too long to print  whole,  as  one.   With 
utility  somewhere along search path (in ROOT, say), type PRINT //<cr> to  see
its many features.
     Data  compression,  CRUNCH  is more efficient than  SQUEEZE.   Our  8-bit 
community   is  encouraged  to  phase  out  "squeezing"  files  in  favor   of 
"crunching."   Steven  Greenberg  has taken high-level  language  versions  of 
Lempel-Ziv-Welch  algorithm  implemented and described by  Kent  Williams  and 
produced pair called CRUNCH and UNCR(unch).  Written in assembler, occupy  but 
16  and 15 records, respectively.  SQ occupies 42 to 47 records, depending  on 
version;  USQ,  15, and UF (UsqFast), a low 10.   Steven  claims,  "conversion 
speed  'an  order of magnitude' faster than C-Language  equivalents."   He  is 
thoughtful  enough to have made the pair, plus associated  TYPELZ,  understand 
our  DU form, drive/user areas, for effective use of Z-System facilities.   We 
have  tested CRUNCH and SQUEEZE.  We cannot argue against the former's  super-
iority.   Echelon  supports CRUNCH.  CRUNCH11.LBR is  on  Z-Nodes  everywhere.

From Our Mail Box.   Bob Peddicord, Z-Node #60 Sysop, 503/597-2066, Selma, OR, 
upgrades  VMENU, to Version 1.7, with five-column, 20-file screens  and  other 
improvements.   Style  goes with VFILER, Version 4.0 and beyond.  If  no  bugs 
show, source code is released presently.  Download VMENU17.LBR, if  interested 
(it's on an upcoming SUS, Software Update Service, diskette.)
     From Dennis O'Neill, Electra-Find string-search program author, "When you 
time  an Electra-Find search, you're timing a lot more than a  simple  search.
Many  other  things  happen  that add  considerable  overhead  to  the  search 
time...continually  monitoring keyboard for ESCAPE, to permit  interrupting  a 
search...looking for start and end pointer...Boolean searching for more  words 
in  a  search  list...checking  for  special  search  characteristics,   case-
sensitive,  wildcard, phonetic, exclusion, etc...buffering files  larger  than 
memory...and more."  Yes, Dennis, it takes time to handle features.  We under-
stand price paid for each.  But, your product has it all--features plus speed, 
congratulations!   To  accomplish both is a great achievement.   "Thanks  very 
much  for including Electra-Find in your search time  comparisons,"  concludes 
Dennis.  Hopefully we were objective, fair to all concerned, with our  testing 
reported in Z-News 505 and 506.

Z-User's  Corner.    Earlier  this  year,  Steve  Cohen,  Chicago,  IL,  wrote 
interesting  utility called "W".  Dubbed The Wildcard Shell Processor,  offers 
use  of  wildcards,  the  ? and *, to programs  not  usually  accepting  them.
Stimulated  by a suggestion in Z-News 402 about automating file copying  using 
ZRDOS  utility  COMP  with /T option, copy only if files don't  match,  W  was 
produced.  (Now we only need a ZEX 3.2 with required features to complete what 
402 indicated could be done.)  W permits command

                         w comp WORK:*.* BACKUP:<cr>

to compare, file by file, equality of directories WORK and BACKUP, and command

                               w zas *.z80<cr>

to  assemble all Z80 type files on default directory.  Both commands  function 
correctly, even though your better judgement says they do not!  Command

                              w z3ins *.com<cr>

installs  all Z3 COM files on default directory, in a single  line--lots  more 
convenient  than using an install script.  (Use Version 1.3 of Z3INS.)   Down-
load  file (it's coming by SUS, Software Update Service) W20.LBR from  Z-Nodes 
for more.
     Next subject (Hacker's Corner of Z-News 006 Revisited.)  Okay, we  didn't 
tell   enough.   To  get  a  clean  prompt  for  erase  "E"  command  in   the 
"Housekeeping" menu of Z-News 504, WORK-VMN.LBR, you must comment-out,  remove 
four  (4) lines of code from your SYSFCP.ASM file and reassemble.  In  routine 
IFCINPUT  remove  lines  containing CALL NL, CALL PRIF,  CALL  PRINT,  and  DB 
'True?','  '+80H statements.  We have used modified code for sometime  and  it 
works  find  with CMD, menu, and alias command lines.  Here's  what  our  code 
looks like:

;
; Condition: INPUT (from user)
;
	IF	IFOINPUT
IFCINPUT:
	LXI	H,Z3MSG+7	;pt to ZEX message byte
	MVI	M,10B		;suspend ZEX input
	PUSH	H		;save ptr to ZEX message byte
	IF	NOT NOISE
;	CALL	NL
	ENDIF		;NOT NOISE
;	CALL	PRIF
;	CALL	PRINT
;	DB	'True?',' '+80H
	MVI	C,1		;input from console
         .
         .
	ENDIF		;IFOINPUT

Reassemble and use as SYS.FCP loaded at cold boot.  After, always use an "echo 
prompt"  statement ahead of IF IN conditional.  Modified system segment  works 
with all versions of transient IF.COM up to latest, Version 1.4, even if  "IN" 
has been changed to "XN", Jay Sage convention.
     Next  subject.   Dear to Richard Jacobson's heart is CPSEL,  console  and 
printer  selection  utility.  (Richard runs two phone lines  for  Z-Node  #15, 
Chicago,  312/649-1730,  312/664-1730,  and is co-author  of  Z-System  User's 
Guide.)   Well,  long-time  Echelon customer, John Tuksal  (Livonia,  WI)  has 
created two support utilities that change printer parameters on-the-fly.  They 
are  called  PRTDFLT and PRTSET and on-the-fly patch loaded  SYS.ENV.   (CPSEL 
facility selects which one of four printers are active.  Pages 7-5 through 7-8 
of  Z-System's User's Guide clearly describe features of CPSEL  and  SYS.ENV.)
(Both PAGE and PRINT use environment-data for wrapping lines.)  First  utility 
resets printer to default values; second sets printer to that needed for  next 
task.   Both run from aliases, menus, and from ZEX files.  (You  hackers  will 
appreciate  John's liking for long labels.  Notice his  instructive,  easy-to-
follow source code style in PRTDFLT.LBR and PRTSET.LBR libraries.  Reminds  of 
Andy   Johnson-Laird   in  The  Programmer's  CP/M  Handbook,   published   by 
Osborne/McGraw-Hill.)   Here, two more tools to automate tasks!
     Now  we  list parameters that pass from command line script to  ZCPR3,  a 
table by function and utility:

Lots  of  little details to remember while programming  scripts.   Above  data 
sized for CRT screen could be online, as part of Z-System HLP system, as alias 
containing  Z-COM's  VID to "read" text of table, or as COM  file  made  using 
TXT42 program.

          if $1=//;echo $0 - get z-system parameters table;      <<
          echo syntax: $0<cr>;else;ROOT:;vid params.tbl;$d$u:;fi

Yes, an alias tool for script heaven, called GPT, Get Parameters Table.  $0 is 
name  of  alias;  usually  we directly use the name, but  here  we  wanted  to 
remember  one  of the things $0 can do.  You develop  "params.tbl"  from  text 
table  above--please show us finished product!  That done, back to more  alias 
development.
     SEE,  of  Z-News 504, works so well we expanded it to  near  command-line 
buffer capacity.  Adding built-in help and send-to-printer functions we have:


      if $1=//;echo see - display files in command.lbr;echo syntax:  <<
      see [p];else;if $1=p;ROOT:llf ROOT:command /cip;ROOT:echo $$;  <<
      else;ROOT:llf ROOT:command /ci;fi;fi

In SEE, the "$$" simply sends a single CR/LF combination to printer for  blank 
line  between  print-outs,  but use transient ECHO and not  resident.   $$  is 
passed to command processor from alias script as single $, which is ECHO  flag 
to send text to printer.  But in this case, we have no text and only CR/LF  (a 
blank line) is output.  You could output a form-feed, use $$^L instead, if you 
choose.   Three possibilities with updated version: see<cr> displays files  to 
console,  see p<cr> to console and printer, and see //<cr> for built-in  help.
Now, are you ready for another alias?  Okay, here goes...
     We  use  GETVAR and RESOLVE in GLF.  Get Library  Files  initially  shows 
directory  list for declared library file and then prompts operator  for  file 
list to extract.  Neat and very quick.  Has built-in help and error  messages.
We  use  "glf" as our named variable which gets automatically placed  in  ROOT 
file SH.VAR by GETVAR.

      if $1=//;echo syntax: glf [du:]libname;else;if nu $1;echo glf  <<
      libname;else;llf $1 /ci;quiet s;getvar glf files to extract?;  <<
      resolve lget %glf;quiet r;fi;fi

     Aliases, aliases, cornucopia of aliases--many ways to get jobs done.  And 
now...
     We  thought  you might find our  change-to-another-directory  VMENU  (and 
MENU) command line interesting.  Use L or N as command letter.

    l ROOT:quiet s;ROOT:shctrl p;"Log into New Directory (du/dir): ":;  <<
      ROOT:quiet r;ROOT:vmenu *.* default.vmn

Line is in our default VMN file in ROOT directory.  A similar one should be in 
all other VMNs.  Only modification, "default.vmn" is appropriately renamed  to 
directory-specific  VMENU  name.   Entering  colon (:)  for  du/dir  forms  is 
optional.  From any directory containing specific-for-directory VMN file,  you 
move to others, one-by-one, and still have default, multi-purpose VMN found by 
VMENU's auto-search along path.  Super!
                    -------------------------------------
     As  indicated  in Z Tips above, some LZW/Steven Greenberg  CRUNCH  versus 
Dave  Rand  and  Jim Lopushinsky SQUEEZE benchmarks.  Time  in  seconds;  file 
sizes, records (128 bytes).  Many conclusions to draw.  Let's hear yours?

At  compressing 232-record binary file SQUEEZE fares better than  CRUNCH.   In 
all other cases CRUNCH produces higher uncompressed-to-compressed ratio and is 
faster  at  compressing small files.  UF is  hands-down  winner  uncompressing 
files,  much  faster  than USQ or UNCR.  But notice, little  seems  gained  in 
compressing binary files.  Library file contains 11 ASCII files to make total.
Tests  were conducted with electronic timer, on Ampro Bookshelf 4mHz Z80  hard 
disk computer, and from VFILER, Version 4.1g, CMD macro commands.

Lunch Break.   Renewal and first-time subscriptions to Z-News are needed if we 
are to continue expending energy writing.  If you neither renew nor  subscribe 
for  first time we take it as a signal you think Z-News not worth  your  money 
(see  Z-News 305 concerning money).  Each month thousands read it "free"  from 
remote  access systems and electronic bulletin boards.  Is it not  worth  your 
$24.00  per year to continue reading it?  Labors of love go just so  far  when 
bills  come due!  Please, renew now--become an EI customer, subscribe for  the 
first  time--get  bundled  massive index, Z-Index,  as  part  of  subscription 
renewal.   Index  bundling with renewals expires 31 August 1986.  We  dare  to 
knock even if doors don't open.  Help us to continue to help you.  Thanks!

     Editorial.  The menus and alias scripts generated and discussed in recent 
newsletters  point to solid conclusions about "tool style" versus  "integrated 
application" programs.  V-Spell versus The WORD Plus is good case in point  in 
our  world.   (PC DOS world has many examples of integrated  applications  not 
being universally best.)  VS is integrated and from within program most things 
of  a spelling-word nature are performed, and performed well, but you have  to 
be in the program and cannot do anything from OS command line, except load and 
run program.  On the other hand, TWP closely follows tool concept of ZCPR3 and 
ZRDOS.   TWP permits OS to use its various facilities in custom ways.  GS  and 
WF  aliases  are  representative of what a powerful  OS  teamed  with  single-
function tools can achieve.  Integrated application programs, though having  a 
place  on  our  list of priorities (you, we love VFILER and  NULU),  locks  us 
operators  into mold set by program designers.  Our freedom of  expression  is 
taken  away--we  become more a function of the program than  when  under  non-
integrated concepts.  Long live single-function tools!

Of Cabbages and Kings.   Life: to take on substance (to eat), converting it to 
energy  (essence)  for continuation of being.  From life  comes  upper-echelon 
abstractions:  Time and Intelligence.  Time:  measure of displacement  between 
objects, assuming movement is reality, is concrete.  Intelligence:  measure of 
ability to learn, organize, and communicate.  Notice we do not define but only 
tell  how to gauge.  No definitions!  We, we are "high on a mountain top,"  or 
maybe intoxicated on a hill-side?  And now...
     Z-News 309 Ramblings Revisited.  Each species feeds on another.  Birds on 
worms, animals on plants and fish.  But, if we use a species as food to  main-
tain  our  lives we are obliged to insure the survival of that  species,  like 
farming  (we plant, growth occurs, we eat).  If worms eat all  insects,  there 
are  no  insects.  If birds eat all worms, there are no worms.   If  fishermen 
hunt  and  catch all the whales, there are no whales.  We are all part  of  an 
endless  biological string.  Our feet grew simultaneously with our  head  from 
within  our mother's womb.  We were not put together like  automobiles,  parts 
bolted together, but one whole emerged as with all life.  We evolve...we  eat, 
taking  on  food of many types, we live.  (Z-News 309 tells of many  kinds  of 
food.)   Each group feeds on the other in seemingly unending cycles.  But  who 
or what feeds on human beings?  Don't give your life without also giving  your 
word!  See you down the lines...
