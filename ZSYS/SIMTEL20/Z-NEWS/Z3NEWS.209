Double  FLASH:  REVAS4 gets Hitachi HD64180 code disassembly capability--price 
stays at $90.00!  Al Hawley, REVAS (REVerse ASsemlber) author and Sysop for Z-
Node  #2 and ham radio packet to landline network coordinator,  just  finished 
Hitachi  version.   Registered  REVAS3  owners may  upgrade  for  $20.00  plus 
shipping and handling.  Send Echelon your master diskette.
     TERM III is shipping--one year in development,  planned to take only four 
(4)  months.   Program takes advantage of environment created by  ZCPR3.   Has 
what you would expect from full-feature communications package plus much more. 
Term3 represents new thinking about configurability, flexibility, ease-of-use, 
performance, and modularity.

Z  TIPS:  VFILER36,  VMENU15,  and MENU38 trio is released preliminarily.   Al 
Dunsmuir  (Scarborough,  Ontario) did it again;  we thought previous  versions 
were  great  but latest brings a fine tune to assembly  language  programming. 
Forty-four  code enhancements were introduced to the trio for:   1)  increased 
speed  and quickness,  2) reduced screen rewrites,  and 3)  increased  overall 
flexibility.  About the updates, Al said, "A large effort was made to speed up 
the loading of VFILER and VMENU, and both VMENU and MENU now are a lot smarter 
(search for menu file along path, no extraneous returns/checks of Command line 
status).   VMENU  now  knows about the Command echo flag,  and System  menus." 
Read *.INF within respective .LBR files for specific details,  on Z-Nodes now. 
Z community owes Al much gratitude for his extraordinary attention to  detail, 
his  continuing  concern to establish ZCPR3 utilities best.   He next  tackles 
ZEX, making it an improved (and proper) Z-System program!
     Dennis  Wright,  Z-Team  Member and author of  ZRDOS,  has  upgraded  Ted 
Emigh's  FINDERR to handle ZAS assembler errors.   He also created a nifty ZEX 
file  to go with it.   The way Dennis wrote batch file,  ZEX works  without  a 
glitch.   Find  ZASLINK.ZEX  and new FINDERR.MAC--it's Version 1.4--on  Z-Node 
Central and other nodes.  
     Jay  Sage  checked  out ALIAS for  update,  calling  his  screen-oriented 
version VALIAS,  and Richard Conn works on MKALIAS.  Therefore, we soon should 
have two super make-alias programs with internal editors--good times  continue 
to roll!

Rememorandum:   Many computerists remain that haven't purchased Richard Conn's 
ZCPR3:  The  Manual.   What's the matter with you  estimated  60,000  Z-System 
users?   Bound, typeset, 351 pages, 7.5" by 9.25" size, manual still sells for 
only $19.95, plus $4.00 for shipping and handling costs.  Shipping from stock! 
You  need not another source for facts,  information,  knowledge?   Satisfied? 
Please, think again!
     And there's ZCPR3 and IOPs selling for $9.95, plus shipping and handling, 
or  get  the  tutorial  as a series of files (from  Z-Nodes  as  IOP.LBR)  for 
download  phone-time cost.   Fifty-page (50) loose-leaf document,  written  by 
Richard Conn, explains ZCPR3 input/output redirection philosophy, shows how to 
modify your BIOS to include I/OP segments,  and how to use  DEV,  DEVICE,  and 
RECORD Z-System commands.

Comment  Line:   We are encouraged by volume of mail  we  receive,  indicating 
interest  in high-performance 8-bit products,  and perhaps,  commitment.   One 
problem:   we  don't  have the staff to individually respond to most  of  your 
questions.
     Your efforts are appreciated;  we thank you.   Every letter is  carefully 
read  and we react with what is felt appropriate.   If you haven't received  a 
reply,  don't  think we didn't receive and read your  letter.   Consider:   it 
takes, on average, 20 minutes of someone's time to draft a response; that time 
is worth,  with our present corporate overhead,  about $60.00 per hour.   Thus 
each response costs us $20.00,  deeply cutting into profits, profits so dearly 
needed to continue our developments.   (MicroPro, producer of WordStar, offers 
personalized telephone help at $90.00 for first hour,  if prepaid!  After that 
it's $2.50 per minute!)  Information costs money...
     It  may  be severe but printed material should be read  seven  (7)  times 
before concluding lack of understanding.   Seven times is sufficient to obtain 
meat!   It's a law; from such reading technique, you move from echelon (level) 
to echelon, increasing insight naturally.

Z-Node Activity:  Richard Rodeheaver,  C.O.R.E.  Z-Node #14 Sysop,  advises to 
use  password  RAVEN  when  logging  onto  his  Reynoldsburg,   Ohio,  system.
Richard's number is 614/864-2678.   Another Richard, Petersen, but in El Paso, 
TX, has a new node modem number:  915/821-3638.
     New  1,024k-byte  block  transfer YMODEM and KMD programs  and  2400  bps 
modems  exhibit increased through-put,  reduced stay-time on Z-Nodes.   One k-
byte  blocks  instead of 128-byte increase transfer through-put by  about  30% 
with 2400 bps modems,  by 9% with 1200 bps.   Actual results are determined by 
error rate of transmission circuit.   (US Robotics must make their 2400  modem 
less error prone or they will be black-balled.  The Hayes 1200 is poor enough, 
we can't live with further reductions in quality.  You OEMs listening?)
     Echelon recommends temporarily using KMD (renamed to XMODEM, as suggested 
by its author, Irv Hoff) along with BYE5 on all Z-Nodes, until such time Term3 
replaces both.
     While  on  subject of performance,  Jud  Newell,  Z-Node  #16,  Islington 
(Toronto),  Ontario,  CANADA, has all Echelon files and programs online.  Both 
freely  distributed  ones  (non-commercial  use)  and  proprietary  items  are 
handled.   Jud  is  a  popular software downloader (see Z-News  206)  and  has 
special modem number for his node:   416/231-9202.   If you need our products, 
here's a place to download from!

Amateur  Z User's Corner:  Zas is distributed so assembly produces a REL file, 
one  that  can be used for linking with  subroutine  libraries,  like  SYSLIB, 
Z3LIB,  and VLIB.  (Change defaults by running "install" program.)  Of course, 
REL  files  become COM files using ZLINK and default code origin of  100  hex. 
Add trailing "h" to command line to toggle output to HEX.   An alias,  we call 
it ZASH, to create COM files from HEX using Ron Fowler's MLOAD program is:

           ZAS $1 h;SAK /bp6 Errors, cancel load (^C)?;era $1.bak;
           era $1.com;mload $1;echo;echo erase hex file created?;
           if input;era $1.hex;else;fi

Note  conditional  test  of  HEX file erasure,  in case you  wanted  HEX  file 
retained  for later use.   Command line is ZASH <fn><cr>.   File type (ft)  is 
assumed as .Z80 and must not be entered as part of file name (fn).  Such would 
be passed along with name.   "era $1.bak" would expand to "era fn.ft.bak"  and 
that's not wanted!
     Zilog mnemonics are easy--much easier than Intel--to learn, remember, and 
use.   Best  example,  LD operation replaces five (5) Intel ones:   MOV,  MVI, 
PCHL, XCHG, and SPHL.  Additionally, LD handles operations beyond Intel's 8080 
capability.   You quickly learn register,  immediate, and memory operand (data 
to  be  worked  on)  notation.   Source of data to  right  of  operand  comma, 
destination  to left;  memory data in parenthesis but immediate and  register, 
not.   So think not it difficult to learn Zilog/Hitachi mnemonics, think paths 
(no pun intended) to efficiency, performance, and speed.
     Don't  forget  that  one  of the best ways  to  learn  assembly  language 
programming is to disassemble working programs, ones you have source code for! 
And,  we  know  of no better disassembler  than  REVAS.   Furthermore,  REVAS4 
handles   new,    destined-to-change-microcomputer-world,    Hitachi   HD64180 
instructions.   (If this were a perfect world,  Intel's 8086/80286 would  have 
been upward compatible with 8080/Z80 microprocessor; you know it's not, and it 
isn't!)   Unique  REVAS  manual (it's over 80 pages) guides  you  through  all 
phases of disassembly and promotes quick code learning.
     For  those with limited disk space,  David McCord (Z-Node Central  Sysop) 
has advice.   "A good solution is the Z3 CMDRUN facility.   This allows you to 
group  .COM files into a library (.LBR) file,  where you will not be forced to 
dedicate  storage  [either an allocation block or directory  entry]  for  each 
file,  because library files store member files much more efficiently.  To set 
this  up,  get  the LRUNZ3 file in the UTILITY:  directory here.   Rename  the 
LRUNZ3.COM file to CMDRUN.COM and place on A15:.   Then, create a library file 
of the COM files you want named COMMAND.LBR and place in A15:.  You should now 
be  able to invoke any of the COM files in COMMAND.LBR by just  entering  it's 
name (e.g.,  SHOW<cr>) at the system prompt, just as though it were not really 
actually inside a .LBR file.   Again, see the ARCHIVE: directory for some more 
info on the CMDRUN function of ZCPR3."  Please don't install (load) any of the 
four  Z3 error handlers if you have CMDRUN.COM along file search path--there's 
a logical search conflict!

Public_Domain_Status_of_Echelon_Software:   Questions regarding domain  status 
of ZCPR3 and other EI products are coming in again.   Newsletter 103 discussed 
our position and nothing has changed.   Z3NOTE.MSG file on Z-Nodes also  gives 
details of our status.
     We are aware that several mail-order,  for-profit, companies are offering 
packaged  ZCPR3  software for sale.   If these companies don't have a  license 
from EI they are probably unintentionally selling our software illegally.   We 
hope they apply and get on Echelon's team.   You can help!  Let such companies 
know that Echelon would welcome signing them up with a license arrangement  to 
sell ZCPR3 (and ZRDOS) software.

Question  Anything Not Understood:  Computer literacy,  for many,  appears  to 
stifle  thinking,  certainly a step backwards,  not wanted.   Though increased 
quantity of paperwork always results, quality is something else.  It's good to 
do  some things occasionally by hand,  add a column of numbers now  and  then. 
What we don't use,  we lose!  And a brain is a terrible thing to put into such 
category.  Z-News 109, pg 3, and 203, also pg 3, let us have it in the teeth--
question  results,  even  those produced by  computing  machines.   Understand 
spreadsheet model's way-of-thinking.   We say again (though, at times, we feel 
we plant daisies in South Pole ice):  don't simply be an end-user, be elitist, 
be best-of-class!

Business  Management Character:  Subconscious action,  if fundamentals of Life 
are  lacking (never learned),  leads to human fear (non-receptivity to  things 
new), bogus guilt (self-blame), lack of self-determination (simple re-action), 
and  social  detachment  (avoiding  emotional  pain).   American  big-business 
produces few individuals elevated to far-sighted-ness, produces few who expend 
Cosmic Conscious energy.  We fall into trap thinking next-quarter profits more 
important  than  quality of life (if any) our grand children  (when  grown-up) 
will  experience.   Long  live principles of  Silent  Spring  author,  Rachael 
Carson, and Stanford University Prof. Frederick Terman!
     This  Earth is substance more enduring (holy) than all biological  life--
homo sapiens are but a small aspect of this life.   Until each human becomes a 
sphere,  this planet is our MOTHER and FATHER;  the only commandment:   HONOR! 
If we honor,  all falls/rises into place;  else, face survival uncertainty, fi 
(endif).

                 TERM III COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEM

TERM III is a communications system which runs under the Z-System 
(the  ZCPR3 command processor with,  optionally,  the ZRDOS  CP/M 
BDOS  replacement).    Over  twenty  (20)  programs  provide  the 
following capabilities:

     o interactive communications with remote computer systems
     o reliable file transfer between the user's computer (host)
       and a remote computer
     o control of an auto-dial/auto-answer modem
     o access control for remote system applications (the user's
       system can be set up to be dialed into by outside users)
     o rapid and easy reconfiguration of the communications
       environment for different applications

     TERM  III is integrated with ZCPR3 and provides the Z-System 
user with a communications capability adaptable to a wide variety 
of  needs and can be used in conjunction with his other  Z-System 
tools.  The TERM III programs return result codes (which indicate 
the  success or failure of their operation) in a manner which can 
be  examined  using the IF command.   TERM III  programs  can  be 
employed   in  menus  and  aliases  that  provide  commands   and 
applications environments which are tailored to a user's specific 
needs.  TERM III programs rely upon the environment provided by a 
Z-System for support.  Some aspects of this support include:

     o All screen-oriented displays obtain terminal-specific
       information from the ZCPR3 TCAP
     o Many of the programs return result codes (via the Program
       Error Message in most cases) through the ZCPR3
       Environment Descriptor
     o File references can be prefixed with the ZCPR3 directory
       reference forms (DIR or DU)
     o Path searches or direct ROOT accesses are employed
     o Messages and other attributes of the ZCPR3 environment
       are used extensively

     The large number of features built into the TERM III  System 
combine   to  provide  the  user  with  flexibility  of  use  and 
adaptability to different communications requirements.   Ease  of 
use  and  user-friendliness are also key elements of the  design.  
An outline of the features of the TERM III System follows:

     1. Interactive Communications
        o terminal mode - the user "feels" like he is directly
          connected to the remote computer via a terminal
        o conversation mode - the screen is divided, with
          incoming characters printed in the top half and
          outgoing characters printed in the bottom half
        o translation tables - all incoming and outgoing
          characters pass through translation tables,
          supporting parity transmissions, masking of
          selected characters (such as escape sequences),
          and using different character sets (such as EBCDIC)
        o macro tables - ten predefined strings can be
          transmitted at will, using multiple tables
        o printer output - displayed characters can be queued
          to the printer
        o buffer load and dump - displayed characters can be
          stored in a memory buffer and dumped to disk,
          printer, or the remote computer
        o XON/XOFF recording - displayed characters can be
          stored in a disk file, using XON/XOFF handshaking
          to ensure no loss of data
        o dynamic setting and displaying of environment
          variables for ease of selection of features

     2. File Transfer
        o several communications protocols available, including
          XMODEM with Checksum, XMODEM with CRC, and KERMIT
        o batch file transfer (sending lists of files using
          wild cards) available with some protocols
        o communications server - remote system access and
          control from the user's system without the need
          for the user to issue commands to the remote
          system directly

     3. Modem Control
        o answer the telephone and drop into the Z-System
          environment with a result code (phone rang or
          user abort)
        o dial the telephone based on mnemonics or specific
          telephone numbers, built-in editor
        o rotary dialing - dial all numbers in a directory
          file in sequence until one answers
        o multiple telephone number directories

     4. Access Control
        o LOGIN program
        o selecting the attributes of a user's environment
          based on the user's ID; attributes include:
               - command search path
               - ZCPR3 System Segments loaded
               - startup command line
               - various Environment Descriptor data
               - wheel byte and quiet flag
        o loading a TCAP entry based on the user's ID

     5. Environment Configuration
        o use of Comm Sets (Communications Sets) which
          define the aspects of an environment and
          can be quickly loaded as needed
        o screen-oriented editors to create and tailor
          Comm Sets easily
        o automated program installation procedure with
          installation configuration files

TERM  III  was designed to meet the communications needs  of  the 
serious Z-System user,  and knowledge of that operating system is 
required to make effective use of the combination.   Three books, 
ZCPR3: The Manual, ZCPR3 and IOPs, and ZRDOS Programmer's Manual, 
provide detail descriptions of all Z-System functions.  Prices:
