                             ZCPR3 NEWSLETTER 007


Answers  to  Newsletter  004  Generated Questions:  1)  Both  President  Larry 
Boucher and New Business Development Manager,  Jim Kurinsky,  of Adaptec,  580 
Cottonwood, Milpitas, CA 95035, 408/946-8600, are happy to send you literature 
on their company's fast controller boards and on companies that use them.   2) 
Prices  for  hard disks were given as less than $3000 for 10  to  40  megabyte 
packaged units.   A 10 megabyte unit goes now for about $900.  We're presently 
looking  for  80 megabytes for less than $3000!   The up-to-$600  for  quarter 
megabyte of RAM is for a plug-in board, not the price of loose chips!  (Thanks 
to Robert Heckert, Fullerton, California, for highlighting potential misunder-
standing caused by our phraseologies.)
     Our position,  restated, is:  very useful programs need use no  more than 
20  or  30 kilobytes of RAM,  of Transient Program Area.   Using overlays  and 
chaining  permit  programs of any size to run fast,  very  fast,  if  a  fast, 
correctly  installed,  Winchester is used for program-module storage.   Such a 
philosophy means that BIOS or CP/M-system size is not of much importance.
     It seems there is some emotionalism involved in setting up ZCPR3  systems 
with,  say  only  48K TPA.  (We always assume RAM to be full 64K-bytes.)   Our 
experience suggests few CP/M programs need more than a 48K TPA.   We have  run 
both  T/Maker  and WordStar in 44K and,  subjectively,  can see no  chance  in 
operating  speed  caused  by reduced buffer allocation space.   Who  wants  to 
conduct measurements of time taken to scan files, run spreadsheets, etc., with 
various sizes of TPA?  We'll report your findings here.
     Additionally,  someone  (you)  should,  in our opinion,  do  an  in-depth 
article  comparing the Lasting-Value Softwaretm nature of ZCPR3 to PC-DOS  and 
Unix.   Any takers among you writers?   We'll supply our experience, our facts 
to  support  your  trade-study writings;  and surely you'll  have  no  trouble 
getting  such an article published.   Comparisons of this nature are  hard  to 
come by.  We'll help, if need be!

Important 8-Bit Program:  Outline processing is a mind expanding computer aid; 
KAMAS  is just that.   The acronym comes from Knowledge And Mind Amplification 
System,  a  piece  of  software destined to  mark  our  8-bit  world:  outline 
processing,  wordprocessing,  telecommunications, information retrieval, and a 
Forth-like programming language,  all-in-one.  The system is somewhat command-
line-completion  driven.   Sounds like an ideal program for control by VFILER, 
MENU,  and VMENU.   ZCPR3 could make KAMAS turn-key,  from a series of chained 
(up  to 255),  custom,  easy-to-alter menus.   For $175.00 KAMAS  sounds  like 
something  we would like to push.   CP/M-80 software development is alive  and 
well,  thank you.   But no thanks to many others.  KAMAS is produced by Compu-
sophic Systems,  2525 SW 224th Street,  Aloha,  OR 97006.  Write, or give them 
(Adam Trent, President) a call at telephone 503/649-3765.  (Ezra Shapiro has a 
four-page Preview of program in September issue of BYTE, starting page 123.)
     Some think we don't write (and talk) enough about ZCPR3, but our attitude 
is:   we  have  a super operating system and it's a tool to be used  to  solve 
every day problems.   ZCPR3 provides the environment to integrate  application 
programs  that work hard,  provides a user-interface adaptable (through VMENU, 
MENU  and VFILER) to the experience level of the console operator.   We  speak 
and write of those programs and hardware ideal for the ZCPR3 environment, that 
provide a more-than-competitive, cost effective solution to our problems.  But 
it seems our pronouncements cause a stirring in certain intellectual  circles, 
among those who know the truth of these matters, but are not following through 
with  beliefs.   They  squirm  and turn,  sleep comes not...are  we  tools  of 
commercialism and consumption?   Are we part of this syndrome;  a mirror is in 
the bathroom, but only look if you're not a ZCPR3 user.

Z3  TIPS:  Take a look at what XDIR can do.   It's so powerful that most of us 
never  think  of using things it can do,  because we don't  remember  all  its 
power.   The U trailing option enables displaying all files in all User Areas.  
The  ability  to log disk directory files into a file and then  compare  other 
directories  to  that file is extremely useful and a time-saving  feature  for 
scanning  lots  of disks to find differences among them.   The  negate  option 
permitting  display  of all but the listed files is novel in the  CP/M  world.  
Study  of options possible and comparison table below provides information  on 
its  features.   The  table indicates why it is so difficult to describe  with 
mere words all features of directory display programs provided with ZCPR3.

     Command:  XDIR Version 2.0
     Syntax:   XDIR dir:afn ooo...
            or XDIR /ooo...
     Function: XDIR  displays a disk directory on the console or printer
                     and is a file name scanner.
     Options:
          Aa - Indicate attributes of files to be selected
               a=A for All Files (System and Non-System)
               a=N for Non-System Files [default]
               a=S for System Files
          D  - Send Output to Disk File XDIR.DIR
          Ff - Enable a File Scanner Function
               f=L to Log File Names to FNAMES.DIR
               f=P to Print File Names Stored in FNAMES.DIR
               f=S to Scan Disk and Compare to FNAMES.DIR
          I  - Inspect Logged Files (use with FL option only)
          N  - Negate Selection of Files
          Oo - Select Output Features
               o=A to Disable Display of File Attributes (R, S)
               o=F to Form Feed Printer when Display Done
               o=G to Group Files by Name and Type
               o=H to Display Files in Horizontal Format
          P  - Send Display to Printer
          PF - Send Display to Printer with Trailing Form Feed
          U  - Select All User Areas

A  hardcopy printout (assuming you have a printer) of all characteristics  and 
features  of DIRS (as well as any other help HLP file) can be  obtained  using 
the HELPPR program.  Enter:

                     HELPPR <helpname.HLP> <options> <cr>

Options  for HELPPR are obtained by entering the customary double-slash  after 
the command name:  
                     HELPPR // <cr>

     Not to slight other ZCPR3 directory display programs,  let's compare them 
to  XDIR  using  a matrix table of features and  functions.   Z3  DIR  is  the 
intrinsic assembled in the CP, RCP DIR is in the Resident Command Package, and 
DIR, XD and XDIR are transient COM programs.

            Disk Output           No        No     No    No    Yes
            File Scanner          No        No     No    No    Yes

And now to an equally important program:  PRINT.  Convenient printer fomatting 
and extreme flexibility are main features.   (PAGE, for output to console, has 
similar  features;  remember  PAGE and PRINT can replace intrinsic  built-ins, 
TYPE and LIST.)

     Command:  PRINT Version 2.0
     Syntax:   PRINT dir:afn1,dir:afn2,... o...
     Function: Prints a file on the LST: device, like LIST does, but
               offers many more options.  Prints a heading, pages
               file, numbers pages, numbers lines, places date/time
               stamp on output, puts file name on output, and more.
     Options:
          E  - Exact Print (Expand Tabs, Form Feed, No Line or Page
               Numbers, No Heading)
          F  - Toggle default of file name display on page header
               (default is ON, so F turns off name display)
          H<delim>text<delim> - Define Heading text to appear at the top
               of each page (delim = @, for example)
          I  - Inspect Files (user selects files before printing begins)
          L  - Enable numbering of each line
          M  - Disable Multiple Run Flag (if multiple run is ON, then no
               "Set Top of Form" message appears for each file and PRINT
               moves from one file to another unattended) default is
               with Multiple Run ON
          N  - Disable numbering of each page
          On - Offset from left each line n-spaces to the right
          Sn - Start printing on page n
          T  - Toggle date/time stamp in the header of each page (a TIME
               subroutine must be assembled into PRINT to enable stamp)

     GLOSSARY and ZCPR3 COMMANDS reference cards,  presently shipped with  our 
software,  have  been  sent complementary to all Echelon customers.   We  care 
about  your  well being and believe these two items assist every  day  use  of 
ZCPR3  8-bit  CP/M software,  both during initial learning and  for  promoting 
fuller  retention.   These cards at computer-side permit quick operator assist 
to forgotten commands and word meanings.

Z3_Bug_Report:  Two more come from Peter Lyman of Pasadena, California.  FINDF 
and  UNERASE  both will not do their jobs if the files searched  for  are  the 
first four in the directory on track two of the floppy disk.  Also from Peter, 
HELP doesn't expand tabs because of direct use of BIOS calls, instead of using 
BDOS calls.   So text HLP files using TAB for indent and big spaces don't look 
too good!   Quick solution is to not use TAB in HELP text files,  but five (or 
eight) spaces instead.  We're looking for a satisfactory long-term solution.

Magazine Articles:  Page 396 of BYTE,  September 1984,  gives a little history 
of  ZCPR3  and points to where it's going;  stated at article's  end,  "to  be 
continued."   InfoWorld,  17 September,  1984,  starting page 59,  carries  an 
excellent  review  piece  by  Allen Mehr about Ampro  Bookshelftm  Series  100 
Computers,  as well as kind words describing ZCPR3 and Shell Friendlytm.   The 
machine received highest ratings in categories Setup,  Ease of Use,  and, most 
important,  Performance.   (Please don't miss Echelon's full page ads in Issue 
#10 of User's Guide and October Computer Language magazines.)
     Part One of a ZCPR3 article by Richard Conn appears as keystone piece  in 
October  Computer  Language,  November  for the  second  part.   An  in-depth, 
independent review of ZCPR3 also appears in the November '84 issue.
     The  Dr.  Dobb's Journal article on SYSLIB3 by Robert Blum appears in the 
November  1984 issue.   That same issue of DDJ has an interesting write-up  on 
about making files public (global,  from any directory, access of both command 
and  text files) using a licensed DISK7tm program for special displaying   and 
copying  of  PUBlictm files,  as well as normal files.   Bridger  Mitchell  of 
Plu*Perfect  Systems,  Box 1494,  Idyllwild,  CA 92349,  714/659-4432,  has  a 
thoroughly developed approach to public files under CP/M.   We are considering 
implementing  a  feature  like public files under ZCPR3  if  we  can  preserve 
directory password security.

IBM versus AT&T:  Microsoft wins over Digital Research, we must report.  Xenix 
(Unix  System 3) wins over AT&T System 5.   System 3 is the standard now,  and 
IBM has taken Unix development away from the erstwhile monopoly,  bureaucracy-
infested  AT&T.   IBM is competition-tough.   The PC-AT (Advanced  Technology) 
with Local Area Network (LAN) from Sytek,  Mountain View,  California,  is the 
product big-business wants,  and probably needs and deserves.  (IBM has rights 
to  purchase 5% of Sytek,  which in turn is 51% owned by General  Instrument!)  
IBM  appears  to not be going the time-share approach of mainframes and  minis 
using  Unix.   LAN is efficient,  we said this in several  ways  before.   ESD 
(Entry Systems Division) wins over other divisions; Florida leads the struggle 
against  other parts of the IBM world.   AT&T should have established System 5 
as the standard before it came out with computer hardware.   Apple is dead  in 
this market,  good night Lisa,  or is it Irene?   DRI Concurrent DOS is still-
born,  nary  a  movement detected!   Who needs sales to Fortune 500  companies 
anyway?  A huge, savvy marketing staff cuts the mustard.  That's our musings.
     Digital Research,  if any single company can be given such credit, caused 
the microprocessor to become popular with its virtual-machine operating system 
for 8-bit 8080 cpu's.  But just when the going got competitive, got rough, its 
leadership  was  found wanting.   New leadership of late has done  no  better.  
Johnny-come-recentlies  know little of what they need to know.   They miss the 
boat--see  not the patch for the code!   We sorrow,  again and  again.   Blood 
comes from our pores but,  as we all know,  we reap what we sow;  natural  law 
cannot be circumvented.
     Another  IBM move having profound industry consequences is their endorse-
ment  of Graphic Systems Software,  Wilsonville,  Oregon,  graphics  operating 
system.   This move,  similar to the way IBM adopted Microsoft's MS-DOS, means 
good-bye GSX from DRI!   Mindset Corporation,  Sunnyvale,  California, saw the 
wisdom of GSS when taking it on for their super PC clone.   (But we wonder how 
long such clones can be around with the PC-AT priced the way it is.)
Wyse  Technology,  our favorite terminal manufacturer,  located in  San  Jose, 
California,  has done so well (last year's sales of over $17 million) they are 
going  public with an offering of 1.8 million shares of stock at approximately 
$8.00 per share.   A success in Silicon Valley,  coming from customer-insight, 
courage and simple hard work; westcoast good news!  And now for...

Bad  News:   Sadness darkens our faces with the knowledge that  Ziff-Davis  is 
cancelling publication of Microsystems magazine.   We are charter subscribers, 
remember  the first issue produced with a Diablo daisywheel.   The  magazine's 
demise  signals  another bow-wave in  the  microcomputer  industry--publishing 
power  moving from East to West.   Computer Language and Dr.  Dobb's more than 
fills  the gap vacated by Microsystems,  and User's Guide,  so unique  in  our 
industry,  continues  as the journal of new computer users,  and of those  who 
desire  an in-depth understanding of popular computer programs.   Weekly Info-
World  completes  the quadrangle with timely micro-news and  product  reviews.  
Four  influential--thus  powerful--journals westcoast  produced!   (Let's  not 
forget  both Unix magazines,  UnixWorld and Unix Review,  are from  this  same 
coast.)
     Also,  Microcomputing  magazine  is  finished  after  much  twisting  and 
churning.   BYTE more than covers whatever small void created by one less such 
publication.   And furthermore,  BYTE,  seeing the handwriting on the wall, is 
covering CP/M-80 activity with renewed vigor.  Gee, that's good news!
     About two years ago we proclaimed,  while many seemed not to know what we 
we were talking about,  "There's something sick with an industry that requires 
so  much  money  spent in advertising products.   Company  managers  funneling 
stockholder (or vc) equity capital to pay for ads before products succeed,  or 
much  less make money--such paths lead to Chapter Eleven."  Comes time now  to 
pay  for  short  term views,  for so little  soul  exhibited.   We  need  more 
constructive ideas from people, less copy-cats.  Too many clone-magazines, too 
few  impressed  and  inspired  readers,  too many ads  with  mind-numbing  and 
language-altering   wordings!    The   industry  yields  to   natural   karmic 
retribution.   (Maybe magazine subscription prices are too low,  ad prices too 
high,  management decisions lack insight;  something certainly has been and is 
far less than whole.)
     We presently favor four magazines and their editors:

        1. User's Guide                         2. Dr. Dobb's Journal
           POB 5245                                2464 Embarcadero Way
