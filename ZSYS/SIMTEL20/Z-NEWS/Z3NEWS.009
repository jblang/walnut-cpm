                             ZCPR3 NEWSLETTER 009

Z3  TIPS:   CD  and ST haven't been discussed much and presently appear to  be 
little used features of ZCPR3.   But that should change when we understand the 
environmental flexibility attained with them.   CD (change directory) is  used 
to change from one directory to another with password access security.  That's 
useful,  but  another most important task it performs is automatically running 
ST.COM  (if  exists) on entering the requested directory!   ST (start)  is  an 
alias file (a series of commands known by a short name) that is used to change 
from  a  previous environment to another,  one more useful and  efficient  for 
present tasks.  For example, ST loads new SYSn.NDR file as well as new RCP and 
FCP  files!   Then MENU may be auto-entered as we recommend doing with  DISCAT 
and its global alias,  CAT.   (ST is an alias command;  NDR,  RCP, and FCP are 
system segments loaded by LDR.COM and are memory resident.)  Thus the environ-
ment  is  tailored with those tools to perform work efficiently;  we go  to  a 
different area for this reason.   A little thought and planning applied to all 
tasks  envisioned,  convenient  work space set-up  for  each--that's  advanced 
computing!  An environment is:  specifically designed work space.
     Each  named  directory,  SYSn.NDR,  (with  optional password  access)  is 
created using MKDIR.   ALIAS.COM is used to create custom ST.COM's.   Alias ST 
must  always have the name ST (that's the only file CD auto-runs),  but  NDR's 
may  have any name as long as the type is NDR.   If you are careful,  all  can 
have exact same file name,  but don't copy them from directory to  directory--
one  overwrites another!   Though with same name their contents are different; 
they each produce change, creating desired local environment, e.g.:

                          B0:WORK>cd text:<cr>
                          PW? mypass<cr>
                          C7:TEXT>             (ST has been auto-loaded)

     As distributed,  ZCPR3 permits 14 (fourteen is an odd number, but a dozen 
never  seemed enough) named directories simultaneously in memory (though  it's 
easy  to  allocate more memory buffer space if that's desired,  18  bytes  per 
name).   But by running ST a different named directory file can be loaded  for 
each  directory  entered,  permitting up to 448 names per (logical) drive  (14 
names x 32 areas).   Certainly such a limit places few bounds on most planning 
activities and resultant environments!

We've  come up with a version of ZEX not requiring assembly to install on your 
system.   Advantage  to  those  who don't own MAC  and  SID/ZSID  is  obvious. 
Hurrah!  Now installation of all ZCPR3 utilities is identical using Z3INS.COM, 
SYS.ENV (or Z3.ENV if running Z3-Dot-Com),  and ZCPR3.INS.  The program object 
file is on ZCPR3 RCP/M as ZEX.OBJ.   Rename to ZEX.COM before installing  with 
Z3INS.  (DDT-patching at standard location 10AH is single-file quick way.)
     More  programs on the RCP/M:   Ted Emigh (Raleigh,  North Carolina)  dev-
eloped  a  ZCPR3  tool  called FINDERR.   Warning and fatal  errors  from  M80 
assembly sets ZCPR3 registers;  ZEX processing,  and the like,  react  accord-
ingly.   Other transient (application) programs probably can use FINDERR tech-
niques to advantage, trapping error conditions under ZCPR3.  The five files of 
FINDERR  (including  upgraded M80.ZEX) are on the ZCPR3 RCP/M as  FINDERR.LBR. 
Also LDR11 is there!  It's finally fully fixed, we really believe.
     Additionally,  latest version of DU3 can be downloaded as DU3.OBJ.  Seems 
some  CP/M BIOS implementations didn't like the way the internal help text was 
being processed.  Hopefully new version takes care of that problem.

ZCPR3  BBS and RCP/M Comments:  David McCord has been sensational getting  the 
ZCPR3  board up and running,  and with such dispatch.   (Isaac Salzman,  North 
Hollywood, California, 213/615-6410, and his ZCPR3 RCP/M were an inspiration.)  
Tim Gary's METAL message system employed has many bells and whistles;  truly a 
desirable interface that's easy to use.
     When  logging  on  for first time,  record all dialog  (with  your  modem 
program)  so you can later study the transaction offline.   Be sure to  retain 
list of system commands and instructions going into CP/M area.   And remember, 
after entering CP/M area,  to type PWD (print working directories) so you  see 
(and know) names of all available directories.   Here's how you go from one to 
another--you  name them!   The command line prompt appears:   A0:COMMAND>  and 
you   go  to  another  disk/user  area  by  typing  desired  directory   name. 
A0:COMMAND>ZCPR3:  takes you to the ZCPR3 directory area.   It's not too  much 
different than our homebase computer systems!  You can use TCSELECT to install 
your  terminal  on  the system,  and then take  advantage  of  screen-oriented 
utilities (HELP, etc.) found there!
     Dave  intends (with Tim's assistance) to collect a database of BBS users' 
terminals,  characteristics  auto-activated  after  initial  log-on.   Such  a 
feature is a first, to our knowledge, for BBS's.  ZCPR3 sets news standard!
     Here's what you see if H or ? is entered while in METAL message system:

+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                      * * * ZCPR3 BBS HELP * * *                            |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
"B"             =  Display system Login bulletins (important info).
"C"or"CPM"      =  To go to CP/M with extensive help shown before entering.
"E"             =  Enter a new message into the message data base (prompted).
"G" or "BYE"    =  Log off from the system through Metal BBS (comments req.).
"H" or "?"      =  Repeat the display of this message (get help).
"K"             =  Kill a message to you (only) in the data base.
"LIST"          =  Inquire about a user of this system (last login date, etc).
"O"             =  Show a list of other systems near this Metal BBS.
"Q"             =  Show a quick listing (by subject) of current messages.
"R"             =  Retrieve a specific message by number (repeating).
"REPLY"         =  Reply to a message in the data base (fills in 'to' portion).
"RP"            =  Read new messages since last login, in order with prompting.
"RS"            =  Read any messages in order with prompting.
"S"             =  Show a listing of messages with author and date info.
"U"             =  Change your password, or User parameters.
"W"             =  Re-Display the system Login Welcome Message.
"X"             =  Select the expert mode (short prompts) of operation.
"Y" or "CHAT"   =  Call for the System Operator (6:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m.).
"#"             =  Show vital numbers like high msg., caller #, etc.
Control S or S  =  Suspend output for viewing, any key to restart scrolling.
Control K or K  =  Cease current command and return to command mode.

Commands may be separated by a space or a semicolon to have more than one
command on one line.  Example : R;234 would retrieve message 234.

All outputs will pause after 23 lines, type any key to continue when you
see the [more] prompt.
---------
     Entering  C or CPM at the command line takes you to the RCP/M portion  of 
the  system,  where  you upload and download files  using  Ward  Christensen's 
XMODEM  error checking and correcting transmission protocol.   TERM3 has  this 
protocol, plus...that's another story.

New-Users-of-CP/M_Corner:   The quickest and simplest way to get ZCPR3 up  and 
running  (next to having a CP/M Assembly Language guru living with you) is  to 
install  Z3-DOT-COM;  installation  takes  four (4) minutes  or  less.   After 
installing and having become somewhat familiar with the  new environment,  the 
trick setup results from putting the command Z3 in your CP/M CCP command  line 
buffer.   (Use  DDT  to do this.)  Then on cold-boot the machine comes  up  in 
ZCPR3 and not plain vanilla CP/M.
     Here's  how--SYSGEN  your  system disk outer tracks into memory  (use  of 
SYSGEN is described in CP/M documentation received with your  computer),  SAVE 
40  CPM.SYS <cr>.   Then DDT CPM.SYS <cr>,  display hex and ASCII code using D 
<cr> repeatedly 'till Digital Research copyright notice shows:

    -D<cr>    (sixteen lines of hex and ASCII appear for each D<cr> entered.)
    0980 C3 5C DF C3 58 DF 7F 00 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 
    0990 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 43 4F 50 59 52 49 47 48          COPYRIGH
    09A0 54 20 28 43 29 20 31 39 37 39 2C 20 44 49 47 49  T (C) 1979, DIGI
    09B0 54 41 4C 20 ..... etc.                           TAL RESEARCH  ..

The  important task is finding two "C3"'s (JMP instructions) separated by  two 
characters each,  followed by "7F" and "00" in the line ahead of the DR  copy-
right notice.  (Some computers, like Morrow or Radio Shack, use location 1100H
or some other address,  instead of standard DR DDT image address of 986H,  for 
command line buffer address.)  Now using DDT's S (set) command, do this:
(your console keyboard entries are in bold)

     -S986<cr>
     S986 7F <cr>       (carriage return retains present hex value.)
     S987 00 2          (numbers of characters in cmd, <cr> after each entry;
     S988 20 5A           then the command name in hex.  Z3 = 5A 33.)
     S989 20 33
     S98A 20 0          (NULL for end of command sequence,
     S98B 20 .            a period to terminate S command, then last <cr>.)
     ^C                 (ctrl-c to exit DDT.)

Next,  again SAVE 40 CPM.SYS and SYSGEN saved file to system tracks.   You now 
have your "system" both on disk boot tracks and as a disk file:  CPM.SYS.  And 
more importantly you have Z3-Dot-Com up and running!   Now you can  experience 
the  range  permitted  by  this  epic  program  and  environmentally  enhanced 
operating system.
     If  you have problems putting Z3 in your command buffer and haven't  been 
successful after seven (7) tries,  call your nearest good-neighbor helper,  or 
call us and we'll do what we can to talk you through the operation.
     Two  versions  of Z3-Dot-Com are available:   one for  Z80  machines  and 
another  for 8080/8085.   The latter version is ideal for CompuPro/Zenith dual 
operating system computers.

Z3_Bug_Report:   VFILER's CMD-file menu has a problem.   You can't execute  #-
menu commands (user numbered) from the # menu, but only from the directory-of-
files display!  We've located and fixed the bug (undocumented characteristic). 
The code change fix will be distributed within the fortnight.
     Program bugs are getting few and far apart--that's been our goal from the 
beginning of our software design and development activities.   Let us know  if 
you  find anymore of these pesky little things.   We'll be using the ZCPR3 BBS 
to  release  fixed object files and occasionally source.   The  board  is  the 
quickest  way to transmit and receive messages and programs to and from  ZCPR3 
users--we're a tight community on the move.


From Author of ZCPR3, Richard Conn:


                   WHAT MAKES A PROGRAM INTO A ZCPR3 TOOL?


     There  are  many good programs in the public domain,  and  several  ZCPR3 
tools  duplicate  these  programs  in terms of functionality  in  one  way  or 
another.  For example, the PD offers the directory display programs D, SD, DD, 
and  others,  while the ZCPR3 toolset offers the programs DIR,  XD,  and XDIR.  
Why  duplicate the effort in the ZCPR3 toolset--why not simply  use  available 
public domain programs?
     The  programs in the public domain are not consistent in their syntax  or 
method of use,  by and large.  I created the ZCPR3 tools to be consistent in a 
number of ways:

       1.  The public domain tools which were not associated with 
     ZCPR3  did not know how to deal with the ZCPR3  environment.  
     Named directories,  like PASCAL:,  could not be  referenced, 
     and  the  command search path had no meaning  to  them,  for 
     instance.
       2.  A  consistent  syntax was not supported.   Some  tools 
     required  their arguments to be prefixed by "-",  others  by 
     "$",  others by nothing at all or a space,  etc.  All of the 
     ZCPR3  tools  prefix their arguments with a "/"  if  a  file 
     reference  is  not provided,  or a space or a "/" if a  file 
     reference is provided.
       3.  The   built-in  help  feature  was   not   universally 
     supported.   Some  programs told you how to use them if  you 
     typed  in  their  name with no  arguments,  others  did  not 
     provide any internal documentation at all,  etc.   I did not 
     succeed  in making all of the ZCPR3 tools consistent in this 
     sense,  but the attempt was made.   Many, but not all, ZCPR3 
     tools  contain built-in documentation which is  acquired  by 
     typing tool's name followed by two slashes, like "XD //".
       4.  The  tools didn't support lists of files as  arguments 
     when  it  made  functional sense to.   I'm really  a  strong 
     advocate  of  this;  if  I want to  print  five  files,  for 
     instance,  I would rather issue one PRINT command with  five 
     files  named (or one AFN and then perform an inspection) and 
     let  it go than issue one PRINT command with one file  name, 
     and then another PRINT command, etc.

     I encourage everyone to enjoy their ZCPR3 system, write tools for it, and 
contribute them to the user community.  I feel, however, that a program is not 
a ZCPR3 tool unless it abides by the rules specified above as much as possible 
(rules  3 and 4 sometimes don't apply or are simply waived).   SYSLIB,  Z3LIB, 
and VLIB all contribute toward providing the support necessary to make the job 
of tool consistency and adherence to these rules less of a task.





Utility  Update Note from Rick:  The new DPROG (Version 1.1) is  significantly 
different from initial Phase 2 release version,  thanks to one simple  change. 
Instead of simply programming devices from a file using commands like:   DPROG 
ASM to program a terminal (function keys,  user message line, etc.) to support 
the  user  in Assembly Language programming,  the new DPROG also allows  words 
(defined in the indicated file) to be specified on the command line like:

                           DPROG EPSON ELONG FONT2

     Such  capability  greatly extends the utility of  DPROG.   In  the  above 
example,  DPROG  will  read in the file EPSON.DPG,  process it (including  the 
definition of whatever words are contained in this file,  such as ELONG  which 
commands  the  printer to go to elongated print and FONT2 which  selects  some 
character  set/font  numbered 2),  and then pass over the words  (or  strings) 
specified in the command line.  By writing a file which programs your printer, 
whether it is an EPSON,  OKIDATA,  TOSHIBA,  etc,  you can use DPROG to select 
printer output attributes.

     Included  with  the new DPROG is a help file (DPROG.HLP) which  documents 
this new feature and several sample *.DPG files.   The file P1350.DPG programs 
my Toshiba P1350 printer and should serve as an example to users on how to set 
up a DPG file for their own printers.
----------
Echelon ships DPROG,  Version 1.1,  as part of new Core,  Utility, and Phase 2 
orders.  DPROG.HLP and *.DPG files are on the ZCPR3 BBS within the fortnight.

Alarm Bells Ringing...tools,  program fixes and improvements to be  considered 
for  official distribution must come to Echelon first!   We are  configuration 
managers  for  all  ZCPR3  related software.   Please do not  put  fixes  onto 
RCP/M's:  they confuse too many users as to their status and validity.

Another  ZCPR3  Utility  Program:  Xpert Software (8865  Polland  Avenue,  San 
Diego,   CA  92123)  has  announced  that  their  XtraKey  utility  is   ZCPR3 
compatible--most  other  "key"  programs  are not.   Tom  Geldner  and  Robert 
Greenlee (company co-founders) have a most economical,  complete CRT  console, 
printer  function-key  generator;  we  have not seen  better.   The  CP/M  2.2 
universal package goes for $39.95.   Now that's value.  Order (Visa/Mastercard 
accepted)  by  calling them at 619/268-0112 or send check or money order  plus 
$3.00 shipping (California residents add 6% sales tax).   We add this  program 
to our Lasting-Value Software list.
     Coincidently,  a  ZCPR3 user has developed a function-key program running 
as  a  ZCPR3  system segment I/O (input/output)  Package!   We  presently  are 
reviewing this package and probably will license its use to ZCPR3 users for  a 
small fee.

HELP  us correct mistakes if you think we made some.   If you placed an  order 
for DISCAT,  Phase2, etc. and think it should have arrived by now, and hasn't, 
let  us  know.   These computer database systems we use for  order  entry  and 
shipping are not perfect;  especially not perfect are console operators keying 
characters  into them--we admit that's our biggest problem.   So if you  think 
delivery  is taking too long,  write us a note stating your concern.   (ZCPR3: 
The  Manual,  CP/M Apple ][ and Epson QX-10 disk formats,  and TERM3  are  not 
shipping  presently,  so  don't  write of them.   Presently they  receive  our 
highest priority.)

New Disk Operating System (DOS) takes advantage of extended functions of Zilog 
new Z800 chip!  The DOS is called ZRDOS, Z80/800 Replacement DOS.  ZRDOS mates 
with  ZCPR3's  Wheel Byte and is fully compatible with all  CP/M-80  software. 
Dennis  L.  Wright,  (no relation to Joseph W.  Wright,  but they are friends, 
which establishes relationship) author of this striking code, is one who loves 
8-bit economy and efficiency.  Since Digital Research has apparently abandoned 
our  world  (a  reaction  to Microsoft MS-DOS  and  Xenix  capture  of  16-bit 
operating  system  market),  Echelon has decided to fill the  small  generally 
unnoticed  void  presently  existing.   (We  recently  received  DR's  utility 
proposal  and  found it non-responsive to our needs;  Microsoft never took  us 
seriously.)   Therefore,  we  intend to market a full set of  8-bit  operating 
system, development and support software using Echelon-sponsored ZRDOS, macro-
relocating assembler with linker and librarian, translators, and debuggers.
     Now we search for a competent set of programs to replace MAC, RMAC, LINK, 
M80 and L80...end one era,  begin a new.   Much creativity is coming from many 
small, humble companies and from clever individuals; we prepare to explore and 
use this creativity.
     Down  stream  we  plan  to machine translate all  our  released  programs 
presently using Intel mnemonics to Zilog.   Public domain program XLATE may be 
able  to  effectively perform the job;  we're looking into this  program  plus 
other  translators,  like  ITOZ  (Intel to Zilog) and ZTOI  from  RD  Software 
(Founder,  Robert Doolittle,  Pacific Palisades, California).  Furthermore, RD 
Software  ZDM/ZDMZ  should  handle our debugger needs  for  Assembly  Language 
software development work.  As you see, lots of 8-bit activity...
     OEM/VAR's  may  inexpensively obtain directly from  Echelon  licenses  to 
resell  complete  operating and development  system  packages;  Echelon,  your 
single source for ZCPR3 related software.   Remember, both ZCPR3 and ZRDOS are 
downward compatible with CP/M software.   Those interested can obtain a sample 
agreement  and  more technical details by writing us (please don't  telephone, 
thanks).

Lower-than-expected-demand  for  IBM PC's has created a grey/black  market  of 
discounters  for the product.   Such practices turn business-like blue of  Big 
Blue into a grubby, tattered banner--one filled with short-term greed and lack 
of wholeness.   Despite IBM's seemingly good intentions,  the market they took 
control from pioneers is more than a mess, it's a quagmire!
     Real  leadership would demand an immediate stop to contractually  illegal 
selling (dumping) by their big dealers to unlicensed houses;  but,  IBM's over 
production is so great they covet every potential avenue for buyers, no matter 
the status or money willing to be paid.   Of course, the PC-AT has a lot to do 
with present low demand for the vanilla PC's and XT's.   Contrast this  market 
flux with record October 1984 sales by Ampro Computers, Inc. of Mountain View, 
California.
     As an aside, most popular mainframe IBM 4381 computer memory, using their 
256k-bit chips, sells for (get this) $10,000 per megabyte--that's economy?  We 
guess  $9,000  is for service-after-sales,  $1,000 for hardware...there is  no 
free lunch!

Long live 8-bit machines...






What is Echelon's Business?  Microcomputer pioneer,  George  Morrow,  recently 
asked a similar question about his company:  Morrow Designs, Inc.  Well, EI is 
in  the  business of learning,  becoming more conscience of ourselves and  our 
environment (no pun intended).  We experience rewards from study, work, play--
mentally,  to us, all the same. From these experiences, occasionally we try to 
communicate knowledge,  those things found valuable,  hopefully, to all of us. 
But  recently  we've come to realize that knowledge  (especially  its  cousin, 
understanding) cannot be transmitted,  but data and information can.  So we do 
that instead.  These latter act as catalyst to those former, moving from level 
to level, a swirl of intermingling, dynamic energy.  We first give with little 
concern for what is to be received--but lo,  we receive seven-fold.  Reception 
occurs  at  several levels  simultaneously,  mental,  intellectual,  material, 
emotional...
     The  national  economy  and our industry appear reacting to  an  earlier-
caught dose of malaria, which has become chronic, giving us recurring bouts of 
chills and fever--booms and busts--recession and inflation.  Base our business 
on satisfying sound needs of human nature and our business is  sustained.   We 
try to do this.
     Send  your  thoughts concerning these matters;  we'd like to  know  them. 
Without you, our customers, we learn painfully slow!

Artificial  Intelligence  (AI) Research:  directed efforts supposedly to  make 
life  easier.    The  19-company  AI  grouping  (Microelectronics  &  Computer 
Technology  Corp.  in  Austin,  Texas)  is an example  of  what's  lacking  in 
humanity--a mass of indirection,  no willfulness,  no leadership!   How can we 
discuss  such  a  subject (AI being one never defined,  except by  egotism  of 
highest  order)  without knowing what intelligence is,  much  less  its  bogus 
aspects: the artificial!
     The  Japanese  noble-challenge to US technology leadership  requires  our 
ascending effort, not descending; certainly not degenerate as it now appears.
     Easy  comes by opening our consciousness,  never by masking off  reality. 
Remember  we  are biological life and we live,  or at least  we  should.   Who 
claims  to be a Zombie?    Who set making life easy a goal?   Madison  Avenue, 
those not knowing what good-life is about and seemingly trying to make sure we 
don't find it for ourselves?  Always leading us to mindless consumption.
