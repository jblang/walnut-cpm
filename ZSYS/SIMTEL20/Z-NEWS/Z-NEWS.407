Bootable  Disk  Z-System  for  Kaypro.   Yes, Virginia,  they  are  ready  and
shipping,  for all models and versions of Kaypro 8-bit machines,  $69.95  plus 
$4.00 shipping and handling, continental USA.  Place floppy diskette in drive, 
press  reset,  and full Z-System is running.  Three  pre-configured  versions, 
taking 1 to 5k-bytes of TPA over straight CP/M and all containing PUBLIC ZRDOS 
Plus  including  IOPs, are ready to boot as supplied; Item 13 on  Price  List.
Manual  and  code were developed by Richard Jacobson,  Bruce  Morgen,  Richard 
Conn, Dennis Wright, and EI staff.
     Speaking  of manuals, package comes with best written documentation  thus 
far  offered (because of writing skill of Jacobson and Morgen), explaining  Z-
System  and how to use it; 72 pages, loose-leaf offered alone for $20.00  plus 
shipping  and  handling.   (Bootable disk packages for  Morrow  are  next  off 
production  line.)  Registered users of Z-Com may upgrade for $30.00,  of  Z3-
Dot-Com for $45.00, plus $4.00 shipping and handling continental USA.

Amateur  Z  User  Corner.    An odyssey--all who own Apple  and  IBM  PCs,  or 
compatibles, can now upgrade to Micromint SB180 and COMM180 for more speed and 
flexibility,   and   a  Wyse  Technology  WY-50+  for   its   eye-sight-saving 
characteristics.   Here's the trip:  buy an Integrand Model 3820  Laser-styled 
enclosure  with power supply, a Teac 48tpi DSDD floppy drive, a Xebec OWL  10-
megabyte  hard disk (a Seagate with SCSI controller does nicely), some  cables 
and connectors, and you have IT.  Now none of this comes automatically, and by 
the time you have rounded-up all the bits and pieces, and gotten hardware  and 
software  working  together, you will be a different and better  person.   Why 
different?   Your  Being  is altered by work, mental,  physical,  and  little-
understood  emotional  work, to other than what it was before  odyssey  began.
Why  better?  You understand more fully fundamentals of computing;  from  this 
comes  new  sight, insight.  But, work must be conscious.  If you  have  built 
such  things  many  times before and can do it now  without  thinking  (action 
coming from subconscious), little change occurs in Being.  (Curious how  most-
talked-about items these days are all-in-one cards that permit PCs to run CP/M 
programs.)
     Call  Micromint,  800/635-3355,  to place order for  SB180  and  COMM180; 
Integrand,  209/651-1203,  chassis  and power supplies.   Try  Disks  Plus  at 
312/537-7888  for drives and terminals, and loose ends.  Tell'em Echelon  sent 
you!

QUICK-TASK.   The beat goes on...and what rhythm!  Our multitasking,  ROMable, 
real-time  kernel  (executive) is shipping.  One-time license is  $249.00  per 
physical site or corporate division.  No runtime fees.  Use Q-T as many  times 
as  your  jobs  require.   Item  16 on  Price  List  opens  door  to  low-cost 
programming  for all process control design engineers, using HD64180,  NSC800, 
and  Z80  computer  chips.  Mail box,  suspend,  status,  queue,  round-robin, 
synchronize,  schedule, cancel, resume, read-box, fill-box, interrupt,  clock, 
flag, priority (up to 255), task (up to 255), words and phrases that symbolize 
functions of Q-T command set--move over Hunter and Ready, Palo Alto, CA,  your 
time  is up!  Full source is supplied with package along with  70-page  loose-
leaf instruction manual.
     Routines  and manual were written by Z-Team member, Greg Clark  (Research 
Applications, Inc.), lover of control processes.  Another Z-Team member,  John 
Forker  (Pacific Micro Devices), thoroughly beta tested Q-T  using  real-world 
applications.  Quick-Task is a bargain for those needing multi-tasking,  real-
time control of complex commercial and industrial processes.
ŠTerm3, The Libraries and Graphics.   Release 2 of Term3, Item 61 from EI Price 
List  offered  for $99.00, is shipping, as is Item 28, Graphics  and  Windows, 
$49.00.   Item 28 is supplied with 80-page loose-leaf manual.  (All those  who 
purchased  Release 1 of Term3 receive free upgrade.)   ZCPR3:  The  Libraries, 
Item  82,  can be purchased in a money-saver combination, as  Item  29,  which 
includes Items 27, 28 and 82, all for $129.00, a saving of $18.95.  Book, Item 
82  sells  for  only $29.95, plus REL library code  permits  easy  writing  of 
structured Z-System utilities and application programs.
     Graphics  took  more  time than originally planned  but  now  package  is 
complete, sophisticated.  You hackers will love it--your dream comes true.  We 
continue to develop applicable ASCII terminal list with custom TCAPs.
     Term3,  in  addition to being a full-featured modem  program--bar  none--
permits both wide area and local area networking.  Locally, you set up an  RS-
232  cable  between two or more computers for E-Mail, data transfer,  and  for 
other-computer  (server)  control.   For wide area use, say, to  a  Z-Node  by 
modem,  you  have ability to control remote computer as if yours:   a  unique, 
distributed  hardware  concept.  After connecting to remote and  going  to  OS 
command  line  prompt,  T3SERVER  is  automatically  invoked  by  using  local 
(T3MASTER) commands like GET and PUT.  These, and other commands, accept  wild 
card filename declaration, and comma-delimited multiple filenames as well, for 
packet  transfer  with full CRC of files, at RS-232 rates to 38,400  baud  and 
SCSI to 1.5 megabytes per second.
     T3DO  permits complete automation of logging onto and interacting with  a 
remote  service.   Command set is extensive, permitting any normal  series  of 
functions to automatically execute, and be re-used over and over.
     Full implementation of KERMIT protocol, integrated into package,  permits 
easy time-share minicomputer and mainframe communications.
     Manual only is offered for $20.00, applicable later to program  purchase, 
and fully explains Term3's vast capabilities.  We say again:  even if you  own 
other  modem  programs,  public domain or commercial,  you  will  want  Term3, 
Release 2; it's that good, period.  Lasting-Value Software!

Z-Node Activity.   Z-Node #66 comes online with a 10-megabyte Ampro Bookshelf.
From  the land of gorgeous flowers, and swaying palms and sarongs,  David  Van 
Horn,  Honolulu,  HI  96814, 808/527-8668, manages to keep  ends  together  by 
working even though beautiful surroundings distract so.  Just a  hop-skip-and-
jump from here, and we are in Japan, closing our global communications loop.
     Bravo!   Father Richard Driscoll is online, 602/939-6734, Z-Node #20,  in 
Greater Phoenix (Glendale), AZ 85301.  We have been pulling to have this  node 
operational for a long time.  Bravo!  Bravo!  Our prayers are  answered--three 
nodes online in WONDERful state of Arizona.
     Z-Node  #52, Wells Brimhall, Phoenix, AZ 85028, 602/996-8739,  goes  from 
Kaypro  10  to  S-100 ICD XL-M180 and 80 megabyte hard disk.  Such  a  big  Z-
System,  called  Z-Paradise!  (We said Arizona is a  wonderful  state.)   Give 
Wells a call and see what massive storage is all about.

From  Our  Mail  Box.   "EXPRESS 2.0...ability to handle  files  of  unlimited 
length  marks it out at once from such toys as VDO and Jerry Pournelle's  ewe-
lamb,  WRITE (currently listed at $239.00!)."  R.W. Odlin,  Sedro-Wolley,  WA, 
likes  TCI's editor at $29.95.  We own a copy and think of it as  a  candidate 
for being a full Z3 utility.  We write to TCI months ago and have not received 
a reply.  We are investigating many possibilities to obtain a righteous editor 
to call our own.
     From Duncan Chopoorian, Newport, RI, "I would like to be informed of  the 
future availability of a banked ZRDOS.  The overall goal is to keep the TPA at 
60K  or more."  Our newsletters bring information of products to the world  as 
soon as we know facts.  Z-News 401 and 406 tell of banked activities.  Also an Šindex  to  Z-News is soon to be released that should make it  easier  to  find 
subjects of interest.
     "Will  ZRDOS3  and ZCPR3M3/S3 be easily installed on the SB180  or  other 
computer  systems...what  software do you recommend for Z-System  use?"   J.P. 
O'Connor, Cincinnati, OH, wants to know, along with many others, what it  will 
take to install our new multitasking OS.  Well, easy it will be for the SB180, 
PRO-180,  XL-M180,  and DT42 computers, but will require  some  porting,  BIOS 
modifications  for banked-memory Z80 machines.  As new OS nears completion  we 
will pass along in Z-News and on Z-Node RAS details of installation.  Software 
we use and recommend has been discussed in many of previous issues of  Z-News.
Why  not procure 24 back issues for $12.00!  Subscription is $24.00  per  year 
for approximately 25 issues, Item 83 on Price List.
     Many have asked--yes, Wyse Technology WY-30 terminal runs at up to 38,400 
baud  and has WY-50 efficient window and graphics firmware  built-in...such  a 
bargain.   WY-30,  $335.00  is  price from  The  Purchasing  Agent,  2444  Old 
Middlefield  Way, Mountain View, CA 94043, 415/964-8222, FOB  shipping  point.
And, WY-50 goes for $450.00; WY50+, $500.00.  Quality and value, this trio!

Potpourri.    Richard Conn works on FINDS, Find String, as a tool in  set  for 
release  with  ZCPR33.  Hopefully, NULU, Version 3.0, is ready at  same  time; 
Martin  Murray, you listening!  Richard's LX, LLF, LGET, and LHELP  need  your 
NULU as full Z3 utility.
     For those wondering about new HD64180 that handles 1-megabyte of RAM  and 
converting  SB180  over to it:  physically, chip comes in what's  called  PLCC 
package and is about one-inch square, 68 pins, 17 to the side.  The SB180 uses 
the  DIP 64-pin "shrink" package that's totally different, and  larger.   Thus 
it's  possible  to fix up a hardware jumper system to make new  chip  work  in 
place of old, but...
     Our  new DOS, ZRDOS3, makes use of Hitachi onchip memory management  unit 
(MMU),  either old or new HD64180.  We hope to handle memory in 4k-  to  256k-
byte blocks using this hardware standard, as opposed to varied existing banked 
Z80  methods.  Up to 16 megabytes are planned to be callable by DOS  function.
So  main  advantage  of new chip is board-space-saving  size;  and,  hopefully 
higher speed, 9.2 mHz versus 6.1 at 70 degrees Celsius.  New chips should  run 
at 12.28 mHz at normal human-enduring 55 degrees.
     As our software designs firm we pass along details.  At present, you know 
all  that  we are sure of regarding multitasking and  big  memory  management.
Look  at  our graphics demo and you see how windows and pull  down  menus  are 
planned  to  be used.  Get file GRDEMO.LBR from Z-Nodes  everywhere,  even  in 
Europe and Australia.

Of  Cabbages  and  Kings.   The title "wise" is, for the  most  part,  falsely 
applied.  How can one be a wise person, if he does not know any better how  to 
live than other people?  Does Wisdom work on a tread-mill?  Does it troop?  Is 
there any such thing as wisdom not applied directly to life?  Can we think  of 
a  next life knowing so little about the present?  Heaven, hell, karma,  soul, 
Atman,  and all.  So much foolishness?  Well, you know, if you quiet  yourself 
and earnestly contemplate.  
     It  seems, fewer and fewer thoughts visit a growing person each year,  as 
time  goes by, for the grove in our minds is laid waste--we want  nothing  but 
that it's man-made, material.  We sell our resources to feed ancient fires  of 
ease and greed.
     Our  schools, both public and private, do not teach--they, for  the  most 
part,  indoctrinate, act not as catalysis for thinking, for  learning  how-to-
think.   These  schools  have produced our engineers,  doctors,  lawyers,  and 
journalists.
     Most  schools are overloaded with "administrators" who do not teach,  and Šby their example promote greed and laziness.  Surface people, they know little 
of  courage  and spirit.  Some teachers, mostly those  from  private  schools, 
speak  of an after-life reward but know no-thing of it.  Are thoughts  things?
What  are things?  Where do thoughts come from?  Relationship of conscious  to 
subconscious  mind,  to  superconscious mind?  Knowing little  or  nothing  of 
present life, how can they know anything of next.
     The  few  real  teachers go unnoticed and unrewarded  by  the  community.
Their  labors yield profit, though little money.  These are the  angels;  they 
fly  without needing wings.  Under noses of "authority" they troop-not.   They 
have   LIFE-with-principle;  they  live  deeply,  these  chosen  ones!    Both 
recognition  and reward come to them, but from regions and dimensions  unknown 
to such authority.  See you down the lines...
