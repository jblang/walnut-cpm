Of  Significance.    A  wish comes true...M.A.N.  Systems,  323  North  Third, 
Medford,  OK 73759, telephone 405/395-3849, has XLR8 boards ready to ship  for 
enhancing  Ampro  Z80 computers.  Enhance, how?  Co-board turns  Little  Board 
into  a zero-wait state HD64180 computer adding two additional  serial  ports, 
real time clock, and 256k-bytes of extra RAM.  And most importantly, thanks to 
Arleen  Nipper, XLR8 includes an XBUS expansion port to run Micromint's  GT180 
high  resolution  color  graphics board.  Installation  requires  cutting  two 
traces  on  Ampro's  Little Board and adding a short  wire,  plus  two  socket 
jumpers.  Resulting combination provides one Centronics parallel and four  RS-
232  serial ports.  Prices: 6mHz version is $299.95; 9mHz version is  $349.95.
Think,  your Ampro Little Board running at 9mHz with the GT180 color  graphics 
board.

     Echelon negotiates to become a distributor of Plu*Perfect's  BackGrounder 
ii  and  DateStamper,  both programs written by Bridger  Mitchell,  author  of 
string-search speedster, JetFind.  Watch for further details.

From  Our  Mail Box.   "I recently received Z80 Turbo Modula-2 and I  am  very 
pleasantly surprised with its sophistication and ease of use.  The performance 
of  the  edit/compile/debug cycle on my 6-mHz Z80 system with a  one  megabyte 
RAMdisk  is  amazing!"  writes Eric Schuyler, Amherst,  NY.   "Will  technical 
support and/or upgrades be provided by Borland or Echelon?"  By us, Eric.   We 
fully  support TM-2, and its integration with assembly language code  and  our 
libraries.  (Eric sent along some of his benchmark data confirming our testing 
of Z-News 607-2, 608-2.)
     Glenn  Brooke,  Evanston, IL, asks about run-time  package  automatically 
contained  in Turbo Modula-2 COM files.  Yes, there is one, Glenn, and we  are 
working to break it up into many small modules so only the pieces required for 
a particular program need be included.    We are also working on routines that 
let  you  use SYSLIB, VLIB, and Z3LIB from within TM-2.  It's coming real soon 
now.  Watch the Z-Nodes!  Be sure to get Good-Neighbor Helper Steven  Kirsch's 
white  paper (in file TM2NOT10.LBR on Z-Nodes and SUS #9) on  using  assembler 
and  interrupt driven task-switching with TM-2.  Steven has quite a  story  to 
tell, being the first user to develop a complete product using TM-2.
     Lots  of  reports coming in comparing FTL (Workman  and  Associates)  and 
Turbo  Modula-2.  TM-2 has an editor that handles files larger than  available 
TPA, as large as disk space.  FTL has a two-file editor but editor is so  big, 
over 40k-bytes, there is little room in TPA to edit two files; FTL's editor is 
memory  based.  After error correction, FTL compile starts over at the  begin-
ning, Turbo starts where it left off.  FTL produces small COM files, but  they 
run slower than Turbo's files which usually are larger.  FTL compiler is  fast 
but  linker is slow.  Seems FTL (Faster Than Light) has a companion  that  out 
runs  it.  Both must be from another world because nothing can be faster  than 
light in this one.
     "I  have  recently received a copy of your Z-Catalog.  As a user  of  the 
SB180  computer and the Z-System that came with it, I find your approach to  a 
catalog  refreshing in that you not only cover your own products, but  provide 
some coverage on the latest in Z-System compatible hardware,"  writes  William 
Hassard, North Vancouver, B.C., Canada.  Z-News, our fortnighter, covers  just 
about  everything  of interest to the community,  including  product  updates, 
revision levels (Z-News 602-1), and latest in hardware developments.  William, 
thanks for your software order.
     From mile-high Boulder, CO, Don Halford sends magazine article  (Computer 
Design,  January  1, 1987 issue, pages 21 through 29, written by  Ken  Marrin, 
Senior  Editor)  reporting  computer technology  conference,  about  how  many 
vendors feel assembly language should not be allowed to be used!  What we  see 
is a general lack, lack of drive to understand what is necessary to excel.  So 
many  want  instant  results,  or near so, without doing  much  to  get  them.
Article  claims  most  people  see assembly  language  as  "too  challenging."
Solution:  use  high-order language, fully portable from one CPU  to  another, 
forget machine overhead (memory and speed) consequences.  Go for lowest common 
denominator,  that's  the common advice.  Use machines  without  knowing  what 
makes  them tick...disciples of ease, consumption...woe to us...where  are  we 
being lead?
     Now-and-then  we  are asked about floppy disk drives and  "which  one  is 
best."  Well, we have no scientific means to determine longevity,  ruggedness, 
compatibility,  acoustic noise levels, and other characteristics.  But  we  do 
have  a  feel, an opinion, because of using so many for so long.   Hands  down 
winner  are those from Fujitsu.  They seem to be fastest and quietist  of  the 
lot,  more reliable than most.  Second is Canon, reliable and fast but  noisy.
Mitsubishi,  Qume,  Panasonic, Chinon (here's one to  watch),  Teac,  Shugart, 
Tandon, you take it from there.

Z-Node  Activity.   From Winnipeg, Manitoba, Sysop Terry Smythe,  Z-Node  #40, 
204/832-4593,  has developed a standard for submitting public domain  software 
to  Remote  Access  Systems.  "Necessity is  mother  of  invention."   Terry's 
recommendations  are sound; we approach and encourage all to follow them  when 
writing and when documenting programs for release to public domain.  Get  file 
PDGUID02.LBR from Z-Nodes and SUS #9.
     Z-Node #4 Sysop Ken Jones, Salem, OR, 503/370-7655, takes us to task  for 
thinking he is in Selma, as Bob Peddicord is, and for calling his node by less 
than its formal name, "The Time Taker."  Sorry about that, Ken, but we thought 
we  had  correct  information.  Incidentally, Cairn,  Ken's  wife,  is  taking 
computer  classes and may soon join him using the Z-System, making his  Z-Node 
"a  family affair."  Also, let it be known that Ben Grey, Z-Node #4,  503/644-
4621, calls his RAS "Cedar Mill" in Portland, OR 97229.
     ZPATCH.LBR  comes  to  us from Z-Node #15 and ZSIG.   Written  by  Steven 
Cohen,  Chicago, IL, ZPATCH is the best patcher we have seen, by  far!   Takes 
the screen oriented character of DU3 one step further along the path.  It's  a 
full  Z-System shell, runs other programs from within itself,  has  contextual 
help,  and  complete  online ZCPR3-type HLP file.  Here's the  kind  of  user-
developed,  user-friendly program that makes us all feel good, want to  dance.
Z-System  offers  the power to permit great support utilities to  be  created.
Who submits the next one?

Z-User's  Corner.   We look at PRINT, controlling hardcopy documentation,  and 
text  sent and received over remote access systems (Z-Nodes, BBS's, and  other 
electronic message handling systems).
     PRINT  is covered in ZCPR3: The Manual on pages 73 and 74, in  Z-System's 
User's Guide on pages 7-5, 7-7, and 7-8.  Z-News also discusses using PRINT in 
a  number  of  ways, even in CMD and VMN (or MNU) command  lines  that  permit 
control  of printer line-wrap column.  See issues 005-2, 007-3, 504-3  and  4, 
and 607-3.
     PRINT is versatile, we know that...the next point is the form of the text 
sent  over  communication networks.  Most documents we receive from  RASs  are 
pre-formatted,  left  and right margin justified, created by  word  processors 
outputting  text  to a file.  Of course, whole space characters  are  used  as 
padding to line-up right margins.  When we print such documents on our printer 
we find reading difficult, not smooth.
     If document had been formatted and transmitted ragged right, i.e., justi-
fied  left  margin, unjustified right, we could re-form  and  have  microspace 
justification  on our precision dot-matrix, daisy wheel, and  laser  printers.
If  we don't want to re-form we use PRINT to page out the file on any  one  of 
our  printers.  If the document has been pre-formated, the page  breaks  don't 
necessary  line-up to the printer being used.  Here, PRINT's "exact" (E)  mode 
comes in handy.
     If  you  use WordStar or similar word processor to  create  text,  before 
sending  it over to a RAS, we have found Irv Hoff's FILTW  extremely  helpful.
It's on SUS #3, along with TXTTOWS.  FILTW turns WS files into straight  ASCII 
ones.   But if you have left/right justification, all the soft spaces  between 
words get turned into hard spaces.  Hard spaces can only be removed using your 
intelligence to know which should be removed and which should not.
     Hard  carriage  returns are easily converted to soft ones  using  utility 
(Z)TXTTOWS.  Hard spaces created by running left/right justified WordStar-type 
files  through FILTW (WSTOTXT) must be manually removed one by one.  There  is 
nothing  more  distracting than multiple full-space-characters used  to  line-
justify text.  Ragged right is far easier to read.  Studies have shown  ragged 
right  is,  in  general, easier to read than justified  left/right.   Only  if 
microjustification,  white spaces between words incrementally varied  (adjust-
ment  resolutions of 1/60 to 1/120 inch is standard) along with space  between 
characters  of words, and with accurate word hyphenation to control degree  of 
white  space adjustment required, is right/left justification as easy to  read 
as ragged right.
     Files  for  general electronic distribution should be  ragged  right  and 
unpaginated.   If the receiving person wishes to get justified print  out,  he 
can  run file through TXTTOWS and then reform paragraphs  automatically  using 
WordStar  (Newword) ^QB command.  Printing with PRINT, VFILER's P command,  or 
through a word processor handles pagination, with optional page numbering.

From Webster's Dictionary.   "Kern (corner, hinge)--a part of a typeset letter 
[character]  that  projects  beyond  its side  bearings."   In  the  world  of 
typesetting,  kerning  means  to "tighten-up" where it  makes  sense,  keeping 
overall  white  space area visually constant between characters,  as  casually 
observed by scanning eye of reader.
     Kerning  goes beyond proportional spacing and gives "typeset" its  unique 
quality, and easy-to-read character, no pun intended.  Nonetheless, above  all 
else, typeset means sharp images, high-resolution letters on paper.
     Capital letters, J, V, W, Y, followed by a diminutive lower-case  letter, 
are  perfect candidates for kerning.  T followed by a lower-case o,  beginning 
of  a  sentence with word "To", is also perfect.  Move the "o"  to  the  left, 
under the right horizontal overhang of the "T" and you have it.  To becomes To 
when kerned; You goes to You.
     Now go over Z-News looking for examples of kerning--there is plenty here.
Hint--notice  "Ke" and "go" in "Kerning goes" clause opening second  paragraph 
of this section.  (Only in hardcopy version is kerning to be noted.)
     A printer's (either mechanical or human) main responsibility is producing 
pages  as  pleasant  to read as  technically  possible,  to  hardware/software 
limits.   Whenever  the reader is distracted by the typography  (i.e.,  style, 
arrangement,  or appearance of printed matter), the "type" is  not  efficient.  
Many  a  9-wire  dot-matrix printer and worn-out ribbon have  joined  to  make 
reading less than smooth, to make reading a distracting process.  And,  though 
cosmetics are important contents are even more so.  We work on both.

By Another Name.   An alternate alias editor/generator technique is available, 
similar in philosophy to ACREATE developed by Howard Cripe.  Ernest  Stiltner, 
an avid Z-System user living in Boulder, CO, is author of new BA, Build Alias, 
utility.   We intend to make it part of our "Writer's Workbench," but for  now 
we  separately  present BA for $12.95 plus shipping  and  handling.   Includes 
extensive online HLP file, but no hardcopy documentation.  Item 67 on EI Price 
List.   (We  have not established prices yet for Writer's Workbench  of  which 
JetFind is part of, or for previously mentioned "Programmer's Toolbox.")
     Being able to use your editor, any editor, to create and modify  aliases, 
i.e.,  batch  files of more than one command, is BA's  main  attraction.   Our 
present screen-oriented alias editors, BALIAS, TALIAS, and VALIAS, are patter-
ned after WordStar control codes for cursor movement, saving, etc.  BA uses  a 
"skeleton"  ZCPR3 alias file and overlays your editor-created script into  it.
Any  editor you are comfortable with may be used.  Alias COM file  created  is 
always 1k-bytes in length.  Number of bytes to be held by command line  buffer 
(CLB) is given, for maximum expansion of parameters in alias. 
     First time, you create alias script with your editor and use PROTO.COM as 
skeleton.   Forms  acceptable:  1) separate command per line, or  2)  multiple 
commands  per line separated by semicolons.  Lines with a semicolon in  column 
one  are  retained  as comments.  You start up with blank  alias  provided,  a 
skeleton named PROTO.COM.  The flow is: 

                             newalias.CMD
                                         \
                                          BA ==> newalias.COM
                                         /
                             oldalias.COM
Syntax:
   BA<cr>     The command file "newalias.CMD" is requested from the console.
   The skeleton alias is read first time from file PROTO.COM, then each time
   thereafter "oldalias.COM" is read.
   BA commandfile<cr>     Commands are read from commandfile, "newalias.CMD".
   The skeleton alias is read from file PROTO.COM, "oldalias.COM".
   BA commandfile skeletonfile<cr>     Commands are read from "newalias.cmd".
   The skeleton alias is read from skeletonfile, i.e., previous COM version of
   last edited alias script, i.e., "oldalias.CMD".

An  alias  can  be  used to update an  alias:  edit  a15:$1.CMD;BA  a15:$1.CMD 
a15:$1.COM.   "edit" is your editor or wordprocessor, e.g., LZED  or  Express; 
CMD  is  file  type  of  script  created  by  you.   COM  is  runnable  alias.
Distribution  alias  is  named  EA,  Edit  Alias.   Command  line  syntax:  ea 
alias<cr>,  where  "alias"  is name of alias you wish  to  modify.   From  any 
directory  you  can immediately edit aliases in the directory,  A15:  in  this 
example, where you keep all your aliases.  BA features: 

   1. Last two versions of alias are displayed on console screen.
   2. Two character counts are displayed: for new source file (script of
      alias.CMD), and for if "$" parameter fields are expanded to their
      maximums.  Comparing counts with length of your CLB catches possible
      buffer overflow.
   3. The alias script is available to be included in documentation.  In menu
      systems, alias scripts easily converted to command macros.
   4. CRC value displayed for latest version of alias.
   5. CP/M file convention of spaces expanded from tabs correctly handled.
   6. Online ZCPR3-convention HLP file.

     Show  Aliases alias: sa contains ROOT:dir14 ROOT:*.cmd h to  display  all 
CMD aliases in ROOT: directory.  sa<cr> is simple syntax.
     Those  who  create,  edit,  and manage text on  a  regular  basis,  using 
Z80/HD64180-based  computers  to develop magazine  articles,  reports,  books, 
etc.,  appreciate  ability  to use same wordprocessor  or  editor  to  create, 
modify, and manage ZCPR3 aliases.  Give BA a try and see what you think.

In Other Words.   Twelve points to a pica, 12 inches to a foot, 12 months to a 
year, 12 Constellations in the Zodiac.  Twelve, a dozen, of what  significance 
is such a number?  Is there more to numbers than meets the eye.
     Chaos, mentioned in Z-News 606-3, is not all bad...its teaches things  we 
need to know...using non-linear computer models we learn even the most  random 
of  things  can have a pattern, a design  plan...geometric  structures  called 
fractals  come to mind, elegant example shown in sidebar.  Maybe there  is  no 
random behavior in our universe...

            "I have but one lamp by which my feet are guided, and
   that is the lamp of experience.  I know of no way of judging the future
       but by the past."--Patrick Henry, 1736-1799, American statesman.

We thought of a joke symbolizing so many North Americans.  Two joggers are  in 
the  woods, relaxing after a hard run, when suddenly, a big black  bear  comes 
charging  towards them.  One starts putting on his jogging shoes as the  other 
says,  "You know you can't outrun a black bear!"  "I know I can't, but I  only 
have  to outrun you."  Long term goals aren't important, just what I can  make 
on  the  next  deal.   That's it!  That's the majority  of  people  making  up 
corporate-America leadership--ignorant, self-centered, thus non-whole.
     On  the other hand, orchids, champagne, and congratulations go to  Dennis 
Connor,  to  his crew and supporters (San Diego Yacht Club  plus  others)  for 
winning  back America's Cup.  "Stars and Stripes" swells our chest by  winning 
over  our Down Under friends.  Aussies have nothing to be ashamed  of  either.
Jobs well done!
==============================================================================
Of  Angels and Eagles.   So many just want to use, and not to  learn...surface 
actions,  thoughts.  Power comes from understanding, not simply  from  blindly 
using  and  producing...mental attitude is everything...one person's  work  is 
another's  play,  fulfillment...truck  not in  slothfulness.   When  we  learn 
fundamentals  of  a process, we...we learn of Life!  Now to  our  Patsy  Cline 
records.  See you down the lines...
