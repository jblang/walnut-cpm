Benchmarking.    DT42  single-board  computer  combined  with  co-board,   The 
SemiDisk, both from SemiDisk Systems of Beaverton/Aloha, OR, transfers data at 
peak  (burst) rates between 0.8 and 1.6 megabytes per second, for  CPU  clocks 
from  6.144  to  12.288 mHz.  (Micromint's SB180FX  with  RAM  extension-board 
provides  similar performance.)  Such rates are blindingly quick, compared  to 
typical  rotary  machinery.  Transferring from one partition  to  another,  20 
files  occupying 400k-bytes, takes from 11 to 22 seconds, depending  on  clock 
rate,  using  ZRDOS AC copy utility.  (Using CRC  verification  about  doubles 
time.   Some time is taken outputting messages to screen, setting  up  extents 
and other operating system overhead, and then finding next file to copy--real-
world  situation.)   Here, effective transfer rate is 36k to 72k  per  second, 
which  is 6 to 15 times faster than typical hard disk  installations.   During 
multi-file copying, Z80 Ampro hard disk transfers about 5k-bytes per second.
     Some  measurements  obtained copying a single 160k-byte file  using  High 
Tech K-20, Morrow MD3 with Advanced Concepts Mini-Winnie (Z-News 408-2), Ampro 
4mHz  Z80 Bookshelf with Seagate 225N SCSI hard disk, and SemiDisk  DT42  with 
6.144mHz HD64180 and 8-megabyte RAMdisk (Z-News 502) computers:

DT42, with 6.144 clock, formats (initializes) its 8-megabyte RAMdisk in  about 
10 seconds.
     Thanks to Ted Silveira, Santa Cruz, CA, for Morrow computer  measurements 
(he  used  CP/M PIP, we used AC).  Results vary significantly, 3 to  1  range, 
depending  on  physical allocation block proximity for either floppy  or  hard 
drives.  RAMdisks are not affected by where fragments of a file get allocated.
Z-News  502 covers advantages of RAMdisk over rotating media,  elimination  of 
spindle  acoustic noise, smaller physical size, better long-term  reliability, 
and  greatly  increased access quickness.  (We welcome benchmarks  from  other 
than our own computers--send them in so we can compare.)

From  Our  Mail Box.   "The Modula-2 software sounds great and, as soon  as  I 
can, I plan to order it from you.  Your comments about it and the graphics  of 
the  Micromint SB180+ has my 'mouth watering.'  When my pocketbook catches  up 
with  my  appetite, I would like to purchase the SB180FX and GT180  with  ZCPR 
3.3.  That ought to be a dynamite system!"  Albert Bjorling, Circleville,  NY, 
thinks as we do, and he renews subscription to the newsletter.
     We  forgot to tell (Z-News 607-4)... Konica Technology is located in  San 
Jose,  CA, telephone 408/263-8210.  Their KT-510 10-megabyte floppy  drive  is 
due  to  be  shipped  mid-1987.  It reads normal  5-1/4"  diskettes,  as  does 
Kodak's.   To our knowledge, Kodak is already shipping theirs, and  with  SCSI 
controller (Z-News 404-4, 502-1).

     "Philosophically  I see Echelon at a crossroad,"  Wil  Schuemann,  Carson 
City, NV, writes.  "As hardware and software get more sophisticated, you  will 
have to decide to what degree you will support people coming into the 'hobby', 
whose  ability  to understand what is happening inside the  computer  will  be 
increasingly inhibited by the vast gulf between their knowledge level and  the 
level of the hardware and software.  If Echelon does not serve these people it 
will  evolve  towards serving the group who are substantially  only  users  of 
computers  motivated  by the natural attraction to more  power  and  features.
This  will  set the stage and Echelon may repeat the recent history  of  other 
firms who evolved into serving groups they really didn't understand.  I'm sure 
you  don't intend that to happen."  Thanks, Wil, for your perception.   Aware-
ness is first step towards more understanding.  Our attitude,  coincidentally, 
is stated below in The Fit Survive.  We do what we can, hopefully learning  as 
we  move  along  the Path, no pun intended.   Additionally,  Wil  relates  his 
interest in writing CBIOSs and needing more information into  operating-system 
workings.  The Programmer's CP/M Handbook, by Andy Johnson-Laird (Z-News  508-
2),  published  1983 by Osborne/McGraw-Hill, 2600 Tenth Street,  Berkeley,  CA 
94710, 415/548-2805, trade paperback of 500+ pages, contains just about every-
thing  one needs to create BIOSs for CP/M-compatible computers.  And it's  our 
favorite  for  learning  ins-and-outs of CP/M.   And  our  ZRDOS  Programmer's 
Manual, tells about ZRDOS functions and how to use its reentrance.  It's  Item 
85  on our Price List, only $8.95, plus shipping and handling.  Be sure,  Wil, 
to let us see your CBIOS creation when you finish.

Z-User's Corner.   Term3 (TERM III) is communications suite and tool box of Z-
System, created by ZCPR3 author Richard Conn.  Our amazement never ceases when 
using its batch (YMODEM) file transfer mode.  It's great to use when on a  RAS 
and you wish to download more than one file, especially lots of files.  At RAS 
prompt  enter: "xmodem sb fn.ft fn2.ft filn.*<cr>" and then after  seeing  KMD 
(most KMDs are renamed to traditional name of XMODEM) calculate statistics  of 
transfer,  enter  "ctrl-\"  to place Term3 in command mode.  If  you  are  not 
already in "batch" then type <cr> followed by "f" to go to File Transfer menu.
There,  type  "b" for batch, followed by "r" which puts you  immediately  into 
Receive  mode.  Now, enter "*.*<cr>" and watch the screen come alive.   Screen 
is  File  Transfer display.  "Function:" starts with "Menu Display"  and  then 
indicates  "Receive  File".   "Activity:" goes from  "Set  Options"  to  "File 
Identity"  to "Synchronization" to "File Transfer", and finally  to  "Transfer 
Done" for each file in batch transfer process.
     During transfer, a section of screen indicates in which directory file is 
being received, its name, amount sent, and last packet sent.  Also full  error 
reports  are  maintained  throughout transfer for each  file.   Automatic  and 
dynamic,  you don't even type in the filename to be received; the "*.*"  entry 
does it for you.
     The  "b"  toggle  leaves you in batch mode until you use  "b"  again,  or 
reload  T3FILER,  the file transfer module, one of 29 such modules  of  Term3.
Here's the screen:
                            FILE TRANSFER

     Change  of  pace.  CRC, Version 2.2, has lots of interesting  and  useful 
features.  Its built-in help screen looks like this:
  
CRC, Version 2.2
 CRC dir:afn1,dir:afn2,... o...
Options:
 C -- Comment Mode (Allow user to comment each entry on disk - wheel only)
 D -- Disk Output (Send Output to Disk in file CRC.CRC - wheel only)
 I -- Inspect Mode (Give user approval option)
 L -- Count Lines of Code
 N -- Do not Number files
 P -- Printer Output (wheel only)
        
Uses Keith Peterson's original CRCK routine to produce 2-byte number.   Useful 
in  determining  if  two or more files are identical.  CRC  permits  adding  a 
comment  to each file, and it counts number of files in list, number of  lines 
in  each  file,  outputs results to screen, and optionally to  disk  file  and 
printer.   Here's screen display we obtained with command crc *.* cdl<cr>  and 
by putting file created here:

Number  of  "Lines"  has  no significance  except  for  straight  text  files.
Comments can be as long as you wish, wrapping CRT screen.  During checking, ^C 
safely cancels process.  CRC22.LBR is on Z-Nodes and on SUS #9.
     Of course, with I/O Package installed and I/O Recorder loaded, we  handle 
displays you see in the newsletters without much effort.  Output going to  CRT 
screen  can  always  be sent, verbatim, appending as we go,  to  default  file 
CONSOLE.FIL.  This file is then read into our text by Newword to show, edited-
to-please,  displays.  We use RC, Record Console, alias  script  (RECORDER.IOP 
loaded at cold boot) to reduce keystrokes to minimum.

      if $1=//;echo rc <cmd string><cr>;else;record on;$*;record off;fi

Command for help display above was rc crc //<cr>, putting CRC's built-in  help 
text  into  file  CONSOLE.FIL.  Read into Newword newsletter  file,  edited  a 
little,  you  see result above.  Whole process took less than a  minute.   You 
take it from here.  More on NUKey and B/Printer in upcoming issues.  The three 
IOPs  are offered for $89.00, Item 45 on Price List; see Z-Catalog,  pages  17 
and 18, Input/Output Packages, for tutorial on the trio and on spectacular BP, 
Background Printer, alias.  Also see Z-News 602-3 for more on BP.

Z-Node  Activity.    Ron McCallister, Seattle, WA, becomes Z-Node  #75  Sysop.
RAS  called "The Widow Maker," Ron runs full Z-System like other  Z-Nodes  and 
gets  into Turbo Modula-2 programming.  Give him a call, 206/588-0643.   "Time 
Taker"  Node  (Ben Grey, Z-News 602-4, 503-644-4621) must be  related  to  TWM 
Node.  What do you think?
     Z-Node #65, managed by Sysop Barron McIntire, gets new telephone  number, 
307-638-1917.   Computer  is now Kaypro 2X with Advent  TurboROM,  20-megabyte 
Seagate  hard  drive,  and  Advent 1-megabyte  RAMdisk.   Message  center  and 
bulletins run from the RAMdisk--sounds like a fast system.  Give Byron a  call 
to see if it is.

Good  Points.    John  H. Adams's first installment of four  for  "An  HD64180 
System" appears in Computer Smyth magazine, Vol.2 No.4, as reported in  Z-News 
605-5.  Before series is over, John will show us how to use material, data and 
text,  from other computers, e.g. IBM PCs, on his Hitachi  Euro-card  computer 
board.
     In same Computer Smyth magazine issue, a short article by Cortney  Smith, 
Tuba  City,  AZ, discusses how to drive an Apple Imagewriter  printer  from  a 
Micromint SB180 computer.  Shows how to build a cable that works.   Interested 
in either?  Subscribe to CS magazine by calling 603/924-9464.  Only $15.00 per 
year, four issues.

Now  For  Something  Completely  Different.    We  notice  many  getting  into 
publishing  using desktop computers.  From our several previous  comments  you 
know  we  are usually more interested in content than form, words  being  more 
important  than  decorative  graphics.  Though  cosmetics  are  important,  we 
emphasize  content,  substance.  Feelings and much information about  what  it 
takes  to  be  in "publishing" can be obtained by  reading  Small  Press,  the 
magazine  for  independent,  in-house, and desktop  publishing.   Small  Press 
magazine  is so eloquently produced we think of the good life, a life of  art, 
music,  literature, beauty, and grace, as we read it.  We are inspired by  the 
magazine.   Here  we  see meaning of content and style,  learn  of  techniques 
working  for "small presses."  Alan Meckler, Publisher, has pulled together  a 
staff  to  cover  quality of presentation,  history  of  low-volume  printing, 
computer  usage,  and  details of getting the work out.   If  interested  call 
203/226-6967, or write Eleven Ferry Lane West, Westport, CT 06880.  Subscript-
ion is $23.95 per year, six issues.  The good life--will you participate?

20/20 Hindsight.   It is not a perfect world!  We goofed with telephone number 
of Z-System distributor Dean Microsystems.  Correct number in Great Britain is 
07357  5155.  Hope this correction causes Gary Maguire to get more  calls,  to 
remain busy.


                               The Fit Survive

We take this space to review briefly our "situation."  Hopefully, our  message 
is received in same spirit as it is sent.
     If  Echelon does not do things in a manner that warrants  your  continued 
support,  we  will go out of business.  We are a small  company  with  limited 
resources,  resources  that  must  be used to  create  revenues.   We  support 
customers  with all our might, but still in many cases it is not  enough.   So 
many  want  something  for nothing, want us to educate them  from  their  non-
technical base.  And then there are those, some few, who want everything free.
These  are the people who use our Z-Nodes to obtain latest-release  files,  Z-
News,  and  documentation, but who never buy anything from us.  We  are  on  a 
knife edge financially.  Our products are low-priced, high-value.  However, to 
support many in the style they require or desire, we should charge many  times 
over  what  we do.  Using hindsight, did we make a mistake  initially  in  our 
product  pricing?   We  don't think so.  But what we do need is  for  more  to 
understand  the  business end of what we are doing.  We  offer  an  attractive 
alternative within the microcomputing arena, one coming from the public domain 
of  yesteryear,  one  existing before present  mainstream  existed,  one  that 
created market now completely dominated by corporate America.
     Echelon's  overhead  is such that every minute of a staff  member's  time 
costs us an average of $1.00.  Such cost is made up of office rental,  postal, 
telephone  and  Telex charges, advertising, brochure and  sales-aid  printing, 
support  for  Z-Team  members,  and  staff  salaries--all  these  declared  as 
overhead.  Direct costs consist of diskettes, media copying labor,  envelopes, 
labels,  manuals  and books, shipping containers, and  royalties  to  authors.
When  dealing  with us, either in writing or over the telephone,  please  keep 
cost-of-time  in mind.  We intend to survive, but only through your  conscious 
help;  we  are  fit  but  we live not in  a  vacuum.   Without  you  and  your 
understanding we are as beach sand.
     Finally,  please observe we are a mail-order company, not store-front  or 
walk-in.  Our new catalog is so detailed, written to educate, few should  have 
questions  about what we offer.  Now, let us all get on with primary  task  of 
learning.  Thank you...

Lunch Break.   Price reduction announced for Micromint's SB180 makes  original 
HD64180 board even more attractive.  Board alone is only $299, full package is 
now  $399.  FX version is about $100 more.  SB180 drives GT180 color  graphics 
co-board.   Both  support 40-pin XBUS expansion.  XBUS should, must  become  a 
standard, mainly because it provides access to high-resolution color  graphics 
of GT180 and allows use of Graphix Toolbox written in Turbo Modula-2.  If  not 
overly  concerned with ultimate speed, original SB180 is a cost-effective  way 
to obtain beyond-conventional, beyond IBM, Atari, Apple, Commodore,  graphics.
Else, SB180FX with GT180 is ticket to warp drive and hyper-space.  Fi.
     Vrooman   Chan  Communications  (VCC)  of  Toronto  offers   single-board 
computer,  VCC180,  using Hitachi HD64180 integrated chip.  Board is  6.5"  by 
4.0" and fits on side of soon-to-be-popular 3.5" microfloppy drives.  Features 
include 512k-bytes of DRAM, Western Digital 1773 floppy controller, two serial 
RS-232 channels, two 28-pin sockets for EPROMs, and 10-pin connector for their 
PennyLAN 500k-baud local area network.  EPROMs can be used to operate  system.
Expansion  bus,  50-pins,  allows adding hard  disk  controllers,  RAM  disks, 
modems,  graphics  cards,  analog interfaces, voice  synthesizers,  and  more.

Of  Angels and Eagles.   South Korea, a country one-quarter California's  size 
but  with  nearly  twice the population (1070 people per square  mile),  is  a 
debtor  nation.   (Japan has 140 million people in an area about the  size  of 
California,  954  people per square mile versus California's 151,  USA's  60.)
South  Korea's  Gross  National Product is about twice its  debt.   They  have 
always been timely with installment payments covering their debt.  Many  other 
nations  have not and is reason some big USA banks are in  financial  trouble.
Well,  we  see their industry by imports from Hyundai, Samsung,  Daewoo,  Gold 
Star, and others.  The people have found a market for their wares.  Overnight, 
it  happened  not.   They  study us for 20 years.   They  understand  what  we 
perceive  as value.  We are known as totally materialistic, no matter what  we 
say,  because of our actions.  Driven by the "Joneses,"  Catch-22  flat-spiral 
style--this  they  know.  South Korea is example of modern people  doing  what 
must be done, each at their level, to improve "quality" of their living.
     General  Motors  slowly  reacts  to  import-automobile  plight  and   its 
increasing  loss  of  market  share, by getting rid of  H.  Ross  Perot,  only 
dissenting  member  of huge Board of Directors.  We say: truly, GM  needs  new 
leadership not coming from within their own ranks.  We have found the  enemy--
it is us!  It is not manufacturing labor unions, it is not engineering, it  is 
not top management.  It is all these elements combined.
     "Now  to break-fast on...Zydeco tacos and... ."  You ask, "What the  heck 
is  a Zydeco taco?"  Well, as far as we know, recipe was created by Queen  Ida 
(aka  Ida Guillory) of Zydeco music fame (Z-News 306-5).  Goes something  like 
this:   1)  deep-fry a corn tortilla formed into a taco shell,  2)  place  ten 
boiled-and-shelled medium crawfish at bottom of shell, 3) splash crawfish with 
Louisiana hot sauce, 4) fill shell to overflowing with shredded lettuce, diced 
near-green  tomatoes, and grated cheese, and then 5) top with  Sauce  Piquant.
Goes good with white Zinfandel or banquet beer, either at a sit-down fancy  or 
drive-in.  See you down the lines...
