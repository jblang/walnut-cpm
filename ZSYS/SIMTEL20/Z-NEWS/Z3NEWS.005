                             ZCPR3 NEWSLETTER 005

First,  we  sense disappointment within the 8-bit CP/M community with  Madison 
Avenue media jumping on IBM,  and now AT & T,  bandwagons -- media acting like 
Pavlov pooches.   You,  as a ZCPR3 user,  are a Quiet Storm representing those 
who  want value and a path to efficient computing systems.   Echelon,  as  you 
know, is aligned with you 100% with our Lasting-Value Softwaretm offerings.

Second,  we started shipping DISCAT during the fortnight.   It has distinction 
being the first application program written specifically for ZCPR3 and  taking 
full advantages of the available environment.  The program is a series of nine 
(9)  modules controlled by either MENU or VMENU.   A complete and unique  disk 
catalog  system results,  easy to change to more or less  features.   Multiple 
catalogs are managed;  working catalogs are merged into the master catalog, as 
desired.   Full  file search scans and space remaining on disks are additional 
features.  New disks are named and disks deleted simply, from the menu.  Speed 
and  database compactness are impressive.   Each action occurs from  a  single 
menu keystroke, or each module can be used from the Z3 command line.  (Tip for 
users:  it's recommended that all catalog files be placed in area A8: and this 
DIR be named CAT; then global Alias, CAT, as shown in the manual, works.) 
     DISCAT sells for only $49.00 and comes with a handsome, 67-page, Operator 
Manual.   In  addition  to  providing complete information on how to  use  the 
catalog system,  an excellent demonstration is included showing how menus  are 
created using ZCPR3 MENU and VMENU Shells.  Copies of both these menu programs 
are  on the catalog program distribution disk.   Coincidentally,  both program 
and manual were written by Richard L. Conn.
     We  search for applications written to take full advantage of Z3's envir-
onmental power.   The next such application program to be out is TERM3tm  fol-
lowed  by a document change-control manager,  being developed by  David Lucky, 
Crescendo  Systems,  Pleasant  Hill,  California.   Let's hear from you  super 
program  designers,  developers  and coders -- become  part  of  Lasting-Value 
Software.

New  Product  Price:   Cutdown version of Z3-Dot-Comtm package for  those  who 
don't  want to buy the full Z3 collection,  or already have it,  is priced  at 
$49.95!   That's  right.   What you get is the auto-install  system  (created, 
designed  and coded by Joseph W. Wright),  plus the 58 utility object files of 
Phase 1 Release,  all on one disk;  two disks if 5 inch.  A user's instruction 
sheet  is  also supplied but utility source code is not.   As  announced  pre-
viously,  the  full-up Z3-Dot-Com package of 4 disks (5 if 5 inch)  sells  for 
$149.00,  including  complete help system and source for more important  util-
ities.   We  recommend  Z3-Dot-Com for the computer user who wants to  install 
ZCPR3  but  knows little or nothing about programming or CP/M  BIOS.   If  you 
grasp some coding,  or want to learn, then the manual-install Core starter-kit 
with the Utilities package is a better deal for $128.00  (Core,  $39.00,  plus 
Utilities, $89.00).  ZCPR3: The Manual is a recommended purchase in all cases.

FLASH:  Richard Conn is negotiating a publishing contract to write his  second 
book.  It's to be called

                            ZCPR3:  The Libraries









ZCPR3 Newsletter 005                                                   Z3 TIPS


and  covers the three subroutine libraries (most important SYSLIB3,  and  VLIB 
and  Z3LIB)  used  to write ZCPR3 and the System Utilities.   A book  of  this 
nature  long has been needed to popularize structured Assembly  Language  pro-
gramming.   Some of us have chosen easy,  go-with-the-flow, paths using medium 
and high-level languages,  and some of us produce loose,  inefficient Assembly 
Language code.   But with such a book to teach, all of us can quickly learn to 
write  super fast and compact code.   (Sorry to announce but Rick's first book 
ZCPR3:  The  Manual presently is estimated to come off the press  around  mid-
October, three to four weeks later than we have been reporting.  It's tough to 
plan these kind of things down to the week.   We sorrow, but what's a few more 
weeks  in  the larger view of things,  especially when we are dealing with  an 
epic like ZCPR3!)

Interesting_Pronouncements:  Mr. Frank DeWeeger,  President of Zilog,  has in-
formed  us the Z800 is scheduled for shipping mid-February 1985.   Wonder  how 
many  hardware  manufacturers are designing to take advantage of  this  upward 
8080/Z80  compatible chip.   It has performance comparable to the Intel  80286 
and  it's  only 8-bit!   CP/M-80 under Z800 control will have 5  to  10  times 
quicker throughput than a 4mHz Z80!  In many ways the Zilog Z800 has bells and 
whistles of both the Intel 80186 and 80286,  but the Z800 is upward compatible 
with  all  that  8-bit software we know and have come to love.   We  hope  you 
noticed 2500AD Software Inc. of Aurora,  Colorado,  in their latest ads, lists 
Z800 XASM Cross Assemblers as "coming soon."

Z3 TIPS:  The PRINT and PAGE utilities have wordwrap features keyed to printer 
and console selected by CPSEL.   The line length of each of four printers  and 
two  CRT's  is  established in the first 128 bytes of  your  SYSENV.LIB  file.  
Wordwrap automatically introduces a CR,  LF to the machine to avoid truncation 
of lines longer than page or screen width.  Wrapped lines are indicated with a 
pair of left pointing brackets,  <<, with paging line-count staying in correct 
order.   Printing  wide  spread or data sheets,  and the like,  on  80  column 
printers  is  possible  without running off the page and losing any  lines  or 
characters.   Setting screen and printer widths to the various maximum machine 
or device column counts avoids untidy viewing or printing.
     PAGE has many desirable features:  scrolling delay speed, skip to specif-
ied page, toggle paging, suspend output, skip to next page.  PRINT is really a 
formatter with:  optional headers, page and line numbering, inspect and select 
files  to be printed first,  sequential multiple file printing,  skip to  next 
file in list, etc.  Both of these utilities provide complete online help using 
the customary double forward slash, //, after a space and the command name.
     Some  users  rename PAGE and PRINT to TYPE and  LIST,  respectively,  and 
don't use the more limited intrinsics or residents.   Most use transients DIR, 
XD and XDIR in place of intrinsic or resident DIR.   These are ways,  but  you 
decide. 
     SHOW  is a utility of extreme usefulness.   After Z3 is  installed,  this 
command shows complete status of operating system environment from a menu with 
eleven (11) sub-screens of information.   Additionally,  SHOW can be installed 
as  an error recovery handler.   The base addresses of each installed  buffer, 
resident  and flow control commands available,  console and printer  presently 
selected,  shells  active,  and system file names are but a few of the  things 
instantly available to refresh fallible console operator memory.  SHOW has but 
one trailing attribute:   E.   SHOW E installs the utility as an error handler 
and  commands  unable to be executed by the operating system are  trapped  and 
shown  as an error message to the operator.   (If SHOW indicates  your  system 
accurately, you know ZCPR3 is correctly installed.)

Z3_Bug_Report:  LDR.COM,  as initially distributed, has a bug in it.  However, 
source file LDR.MAC,  if assembled and loaded, produces the intended COM file.  
We inadvertently included in our release a wrong version as the COM code.  (We 
are  handling  over 2 megabytes of source code and we seem to  make  mistakes, 
here  and  there!)  Thanks to all users,  especially Robert Camner  of  Silver 
Spring,  Maryland,  who have highlighted this LDR bug and its Catch-22 aspect.   
The  BBS  has the intended LDR object file on it.   Present  and  future  disk 
distributions also have the correct object code.

Keystrokes From Z3 Users:  "Thank you for your promptness...  keep up the good 
work  in supporting us ZCPR fans." -- Art  Welsh,  Anchorage,  Alaska.   "This 
software  promotes  learning  computers so quickly;  how can I become  a  beta 
tester for Phase 2 and beyond?  -- Jack Minns,  Sunnyvale,  California.  "Rick 
has done it again;  ZCPR3 is fantastic!" -- John Christensen, Sumner, Washing-
ton.   "ZCPR3  appears to be more than competitive with PC-DOS  2.2."  -- John 
Gliedman,  New York City.   "More people should know of SYSLIB3... " -- Robert 
Blum,  Norcross,  Georgia.   "I  don't know how you can make a profit with the 
prices you charge for all those disks." -- John Marler,  San Jose, California.  
"Tell me,  how do you install it!" -- Edward Kirkham,  Brookfield,  Wisconsin.  
"I must say, this is what I've been waiting for." -- Charles Sanborn, Cypress, 
Texas.
     From  Dr. Neal Koss of Torrance,  California comes this comment re  DRI's 
MAC assembler:

        "There  is an interesting problem with MAC,  which  you  might 
        wish  to tuck away somewhere in the Newsletter.   Suppose  you 
        have a statement somewhere in your program  X EQU Y,  and then 
        somewhere after this statement you have an IF followed by some 
        conditional, followed by some code and then an ENDIF, which is 
        not  an  uncommon thing to do.   If the Y were  actually  some 
        address located further along in the program,  and you at some 
        point in the program also had a jump statement to X,  then the 
        assembler gives a P [phasing] error,  on the EQU,  although it 
        actually  assigns the correct value.   In addition,  the  jump 
        statement assembles a zero value for X.  This implies that you 
        better put the EQU after the actual address Y."

Last,  we're developing a Z3 good-neighbor Helper list.   Those interested  in 
assisting others,  in similar geographical locations,  with ZCPR3 installation 
or modification, please make known your expertise, e.g., Kaypro 2, Osborne, S-
100, Apple with Z80 Softcard, etc.  Additionally, we need your mailing address 
and telephone number(s).   Our biggest lack, presently, is help in areas other 
than S-100 and 8-inch disk drive machines.   Thanks to Dr. Koss for the helper 
idea.  And thanks to the others who have sent or called in useful suggestions.  
Keep it up!   ZCPR3 and The System is living and forever improving; you assist 
in making this so.   We don't want to operate in a vacuum -- your letters  are 
greatly appreciated.  Thanks again.
