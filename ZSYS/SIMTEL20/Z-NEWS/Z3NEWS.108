Z  TIPS:  Robert Doolittle,  author of ZDM/ZDMZ and ITOZ and is Z-Team Member 
(Pacific Palisades,  California),  shows way to reduce BIOS size by over  100 
bytes.   Always, we suggested full environment descriptor storage be included 
in  your BIOS implementation.   No,  only a pointer to the descriptor need be 
implemented!   Bob  has  rightly pointed out that  Newsletter  003,  page  3, 
listing of buffer space can be changed to indicate two address pointers,  and 
not include 128-byte environment data.   He reduced existing 14 lines to only 
7 and completely removed subroutine DEFENV code:

             |   IF    Z3ENV NE 0
             |   IF    INITENV                     
             |  LXI    D,DEFENV                   
             |  LXI    H,Z3ENV                  |   IF     Z3ENV NE 0 
             |  MVI    B,128                    |  LXI     H,Z3ENV  
             |  CALL   MOVLOP                   |  MVI     B,128+32
    from:    |  MVI    B,32              to:    |  CALL    ZEROM 
             |  CALL   ZEROM                    |  LXI     H,Z3CL
             |   ELSE                           |  SHLD    Z3ENV+24
             |  LXI    H,Z3ENV                  |   ENDIF
             |  MVI    B,128+32
             |  CALL   ZEROM
             |   ENDIF
             |   ENDIF

     Z3 command line buffer pointer is stored 24 bytes higher than Z3ENV base 
address.   The first command executed after cold boot should be LDR SYS.ENV--
either  manually or by STARTUP alias--followed by others necessary to set  up 
computer system for desired initial environment.

VFILER  Update:  Jay Sage and Al Dunsmuir independently upgraded Vfiler  into 
version 3.3;  yes,  two of them!  Pandora's Box was nearly opened--thankfully 
not,  though  we are certain Pandora had a nice box,  among other  things--by 
allowing  more than one programmer to work on a program in parallel.   Al has 
volunteered to incorporate Jay's changes into version 3.5.  Oh!  we forget to 
tell  of  Al's  version 3.4--it's  fantastic--presently  on  Z-Node  Central.  
Features added from 3.2, last version with released source, include wild card 
tag/untag commands; unsqueeze files, individually sending to file or by group 
command;  viewing  and  printing squeezed files,  without  unsqueezing;  view 
command last screen bug fixed; and many suave program improvements.
     Jay's 3.3 extends screen highlighting,  permits file-mask when  changing 
directories,  and  most importantly,  is nearly twice as quick when it loads.  
Last item is accomplished by technique of loading a shell,  which Vfiler  is, 
only once.  If nothing else, Al must include this feature in 3.5.

New Policy:  Files for enhancement or bug fixing must be "checked out" before 
changes  can  be considered for acceptance and distribution.   We will  allow 
only  one  person to be working on a program at any  one  time.   The  effort 
required  to  merge two versions of same program is significant,  as Al  will 
find  out  in combining two 3.3's and 3.4 into 3.5.   We can't  do  the  work 
ourselves:  too extensive for our limited resources!
     A  procedure is being prepared and should be up on Z-Node Central as you 
read this.  Simply stated:  you check out file you wish to work on; while you 
have it,  no one else is permitted to update it.   A log will be kept to show 
which files are out and ones available for updating.   List consists of about 
seventy (70) source and twenty (20) support help files.  Obtain "checking out 
and returning file" procedure from Z-Nodes.   File check out must occur  from 
Z-Node Central!

PKey is super keyboard enhancer and is shipped with  source  code!   You edit 
source  for your cpu and terminal speed and maximum number of keys and  their 
lengths,  assemble using Zas or Mac, load with Mload, then rename object file 
to  filetype  IOP.   Here's  a good segment from which to  learn  IOP  coding 
techniques.   Twelve keys of 24-characters each are possible, cleanly fitting 
standard ZCPR3 IOP 1.5k-byte memory space.
     Many  such  segments may be created and saved with different file  names 
and  auto loaded as appropriate within directory being worked;  as Rick  Conn 
would  say,  "Little  CD (Change Directory) and ST (Start) does  the  trick."  
(See Newsletter 009, dated 12 November 1984.)
     Programable  Key  allows creating and saving as many  sets  of  loadable 
segments as desired.  One for word processor, another for communications, for 
spreadsheet,  database management,  programming,  you name it.  PKey displays 
each  key  and  its conversion string,  and prompts for easy  string  change, 
without  ever  affecting  program in  TPA--an  exceptional  value.   Although 
designed  to work with ZRDOS and Z-Com,  PKey (along with I/OR and  BPrinter) 
works perfectly with ZRDOS2 and Z-Com2.

Z-Nodes  swing!  From all over globe come interest in  our  nodes.   Gaffers, 
gripes,  and gophers make it possible,  make it delightful.  We wait day when 
sending a message to France is accomplished without direct cost.   Nodes grow 
until Earth's people fully communicate; add these to list:

ZAS is the Z80 macro assembler being used to support all Z System programming 
activities.   Zas  creates  Intel HEX or Microsoft REL files  permitting  its 
usage in place of Asm,  Mac, Rmac, and Macro-80.  Supporting program provided 
(Zcon)  converts  Intel 8080 mnemonics to Zas Zilog format.   Another  (Zlib) 
permits  creation of binary REL subroutine libraries;  adding,  deleting  and 
replacing  modules,  and  printing  module names and public  symbols  from  a 
library are features.
     Others (Zlink and Zref) permit COM file generation from REL modules  and 
symbol-label  cross reference to numbered source code lines.   Either Zas  or 
Zlink optionally produces DRI compatible SYM files for use with DSD,  Sid, or 
Zsid.
     By the way, DSD (with 55 commands!) ships in two versions along with in-
context  (individual-command) online help.   These versions run automatically 
with  Z  (ZCPR3 and ZRDOS) after installing  using  Z3INS.COM.   One  handles 
extended Intel (similar to TDL/Xitan) mnemonics;  the other, Zilog.  Both run 
with either 8080 or Z80 microprocessors.   Under CP/M-80, both require patch-
file  editing  for your terminal and use of debugger ZDM (or DDT) to  overlay 
main DSD object file.  Source provided permits editing for your terminal code 
and after assembling into hex file,  overlaying both Intel and Zilog versions 
of DSD.COM.

Prices  reduced  for  three Echelon products.   We  seek  wisdom,  not  money 
(really?), so we have reduced prices for these EI software packages:  DSD and 
both  versions of Z-Com2,  Items 07,  08,  and 25 (see attached List  Prices, 
dated 15 March 1985).   We wish we could cut more prices but expenses must be 
covered.   (Notice addition to list of off-shelf Z-Msg--Metal message program 
for Z System--bulletin board, file and mail system!  Also, all versions of Z-
Com and Z-Com2 are supplied with I/O Package buffer space allocated,  so PKey 
and other segments are ready to load.)

Amateur Z-User Corner:  ZDM (or DSD and DDT) makes neat emergency HEX to  COM 
file  converter.   Load your HEX file (note last used address displayed under 
PC  NEXT message) using I<filename.HEX><cr> and R<cr>.   Then exit  and  save 
number  of  hex  pages (xxh) to <filename.COM>.   Number of pages  (each  two 
records,  256  bytes)  to save is determined by dropping the  two  right-hand 
digits  from PC NEXT address.   For example,  if address is 124F,  round  off 
right two digits and use SAVE 12H <filename.COM> as your command  line.   But 
if address is 1200 (on whole page boundary), round down one and save only 11H 
pages.
     Z-Node Central has a number of popular pre-configured ZCPR3 installation 
files:   ready to install for Kaypro,  Osborne,  Morrow, Epson, Xerox, Apple, 
Heath, iBex, and Jade.  Look for them in ARCHIVE directory of node.  Shortly, 
all  Z-Nodes will have these files.   If you are having trouble installing Z3 
on  one  of these machines,  study files to  obtain  get-over-stumbling-block 
ideas.

Computers and Electronics magazine publication termination announced by owner 
Ziff-Davis  (they  cancelled  Microsystems  last  October).   Circulation  is 
600,000!   Now we ask:   on what list should Z-D be placed?   Do colors exist 
darker than black?   Ceasing publication of one magazine in favor (to prop up 
sales)  of  another  (un-named  magazine  owned  by  Z-D,  actually  Creative 
Computing)  should produce a few subscriber reactions,  cancelations  without 
further  regard  for any Z-D publication.   We move away from  such  business 
logic--such decision makers have no feeling for what they are  about--leading 
to  these actions.   Managers and owners have every right to do as they think 
best;  we  have a right to contemplate Z-D going out of business  altogether.  
The  planet  and  cosmos,  in our opinion,  need neither  their  outlook  nor 
expertise.

Microcomputer  boom  continues!   Substantial  1985  gains  (20%  over  1984) 
predicted  in all areas,  best likely is portables (their sales could  double 
over '84,  especially if flat panel displays get easy to read).  Next is home 
and  then office desktops.   Sales to hobbyist and tinker,  being neither  of 
majorities nor mainstreams, are down in noise.
     And still,  many vital niches exist for small companies;  Echelon caters 
to those wishing to learn no matter where (home, office, shop, or laboratory) 
they use computers.  We work on LAN (local area networks permitting computers 
to talk to one another) concepts, AI (artificial intelligence) usefulness and 
what can be done with more powerful (5th generation) software and  databases, 
one  computer/one  user,  and  GSS graphics,  but learning  (expanding  one's 
awareness) is above all else.  You hobbyists and tinkers, you remanence, come 
join and learn as we learn!

Why we do what we do!  Sometimes we think with words that are unwritedownable 
and  notsotalkaboutable.   But clarity notwithstanding,  you know we  support 
high  performance Z80 instruction set compatible  microcomputers.   Eight-bit 
systems  are (to us) symbols of neatness (simplicity) and efficiency (only if 
assembly  language  is  used) and mental challenge (must be  creative  to  be 
competitive with 16/32-bit micros).   Remember, each letter and number in our 
alphabet is represented by 8 bits (a byte) in each machine.
     We provide screen upon which light shines.   You are our light, you fire 
us  up  to jet speeds,  passing eagle and humming bird.   Those who  jump  on 
bandwagons thinking there is no viable alternative:  not figuring things  out 
for themselves, not continuing to learn, not becoming willful, not alive, are 
our light too.
     Capacity  for enjoyment increases as we learn--that's why we do what  we 
do.   Joy  comes from simplest of accomplishments:   a buffer  loads,  screen 
fills  with text,  data viewed,  a beginner overcomes a hurdle.   Our  bird--
though caged--sings!  See you down the lines...

                    Z-Msg Message Handling Program


The  Z-Msg  Message  Handling  Program is used for  local  and  remote 
electronic  mail,  as  public and private access  electronic  bulletin 
boards  (BBS),  inter-office memo tool and product support  aid  using 
available communication channels.   Written in C Language (optimized), 
Z-Msg  is  configurable without need for recompilation,  using  multi-
function menu for quick and easy installation.   Remote communications 
requires use of public domain program BYE.

Ease of use and state-of-art software functionality are designed  into 
Z-Msg.   Message editing by word,  phrase and line,  string searching, 
collecting usage statistics,  configurability,  and security of access 
are engineered into the program.

From the user's perspective, major features include:

     o  Commands to selectively read messages deposited since
        last access of system.

     o  Simple method of replying to and deleting messages being
	read and addressed to user and also replying to other
        messages on system.

     o  Ability to enter up to 100-line messages containing up to
        80 characters per line.  Values are set by the System
        Operator (Sysop) and depend on memory limitations of the
        computer system.

     o  At login, messages addressed to caller/user are announced.
	Information includes sender's name, status of message
        (private or public), and if new since last access.

     o  Articles and Notes commands allow user to read selected
        text files placed by Sysop.  Extensive system information
        usually is found in these areas.

     o  Ability to search within "fields" of message headers, e. g.,
        find and read messages addressed to all users, those of date
        1/23/85, or those having word ZCPR3 within message text.

     o  Commands to read messages in reverse order, most recent first.

     o  Command to only read or to restore deleted (killed)
        messages to active state, provided Sysop has not
        performed a message purge since message were deleted.

     o  Automatic screen page pause, optionally turned off.


Major operational features available to Sysop:

     o  Commands to add, delete, and edit user database, list
        of subscribers to system.

     o  Save messages to disk and output to a printer.

     o  Read standard text files from disk into messages
        being entering.

     o  Flexible purge command permits convenient message database
        maintenance.  Database may be saved to any disk/user area
        (directory) with automatic creation of backup file.


Matrix  and  modular  design promote high  security  and  access-level 
flexibility.   Eight  (8) user access categories are controlled within 
six (6) major functions:

     o  Operating System (OS), Z or CP/M, accessiblility.

     o  Access of user areas within OS (assuming OS access and
	system is running remotely under BYE program).

     o  Length of time system waits for input from user before
	automatically disconnecting, BYE operation assumed.

     o  Ability to enter messages.  All users may leave private
	messages to the System Operator with special commands.

     o  Ability to read and delete private and public messages 
        not addressed to user.

     o  Special OS access if system uses ZCPR Console Command
        Processor Replacement in secure mode (WHEEL byte).
        Manages OS functions ERA, REN, COPY, PATH, PEEK, POKE,
        and other commands.

Price for object file package is $99.95.  Source code is an additional 
$100.  The Z-Msg manual may be purchased separately for $20.00.  $3.00 
covers  shipping  and  handling.   If you  purchase  source  and  make 
changes, Manx Aztec C (v1.05g) is required for compilation.
