Fortnight Flashs.   Hitachi's HD63484 ACRTC (Advanced CRT Controller) makes it 
possible--low  cost,  fast graphics.  Steve Ciarcia writing  in  January  1987 
issue of BYTE, "A complete screen (640 by 480) DMA transfer between SB180  RAM 
and the frame buffer takes only a fraction of a second...it is quite  possible 
to  convert other machines' bit maps (like Macintosh, Amiga, and Atari  520ST) 
for use on the GT180... Now that high-performance, low-cost graphics  hardware 
is  available,  the SB180 and 8-bit software can evolve  to  include  graphics 
applications."  Amen.
     Informative Modula-2 article in Micro/Systems Journal, Jan/Feb '87 issue.
Written  by  Charlie Foster, "Any language is only as good as  the  extent  to 
which  it  helps  the programmer.  As an ex-Pascal advocate, I  can  say  that 
Modula-2 fits the bill.  I don't want to beat the drum about all of its power, 
but I do want to share with you one aspect that I have found outstanding."  He 
speaks  of  creating  modules  and of not having  to  "reinvent  wheels."   If 
interested, get Vol.3, No.1, of MS/J--starts on page 57. 
     Ed Dell, Editor of Computer Symth magazine, Vol.2, No.3, delivers  second 
installment  of  his  "Building  the  Ampro  Little  Board/Plus"  construction 
article.   Over  six  pages, with photos, shows how  to  install  SBC,  floppy 
drives,  and cables into Integrand four-drive enclosure, with  built-in  power 
supplies.  (Earlier reported in Z-News 604-4.)

20/20  Hindsight.    Our  oversight has been advantage  to  other  than  North 
Americans.   Overseas,  Japan, Europe, Australia, South and  Central  America, 
etc., Z-News subscriptions...we must increase subscription price to $38.00 per 
year.   Costs of postage (4-times that of USA and Canada) is major expense  to 
us--you  understand.   North  American subscription price  remains  at  $24.00 
annually.

Good Book.   Z80 assembly language programming is greatly simplified by  using 
SYSLIB,  VLIB and Z3LIB, described in ZCPR3: The Libraries.  Book, written  by 
Richard Conn and published by Echelon, uses practical, detailed examples, nine 
of  them,  with  commentary  paragraphs, plus  assemble,  link  and  execution 
displays.  Forty-three pages of instruction by example.  Book defines over 300 
callable  functions, is the most extensively cross-indexed volume  (done  with 
StarIndex) we have ever seen.   Item 82 on Price List, 310 pages in an Echelon 
plastic binder, $29.95 plus shipping and handling.
     Coincidentally,  North American One-Eighty Group's newsletter,  The  One-
Eighty  File, vol. 1, #9, 9/86, has an excellent Programmer's Corner,  written 
by Bruce Morgen, showing use of SYSLIB.  Ask Bruce his thoughts on  usefulness 
of ZCPR3: The Libraries.  NAOG's address: P.O. Box 2781, Warminster, PA 18974; 
telephone is 215/443-9031.

More  on  JetFind.   We benchmarked JetFind (aka ZGREP),  created  by  Bridger 
Mitchell,  in  Z-News  604-2 and 607-1; we discussed JetFind  and  showed  its 
syntax,  modes,  and string search features in Z-News 608-3;  but,  we  didn't 
point  out  just how useful and versatile it is in Z-System  environment.   It 
types and extracts crunched, squeezed, and straight text members (files)  from 
libraries.  JetFind types them to your screen, and optionally sends to printer 
and a file.  We renamed ours to JF for shorter command-line entry.  Here's  an 
alias  line, "t" for type, for your VFILER CMD script: t!jf -t %$  *.*.   Each 
non-binary  member  in library file pointed to (%$), squeezed,  crunched,  and 
plain text, including WordStar-type files, is paged to your terminal; ^x moves 
you to next file, ^c cancels, any other key to next screen.  JetFind automati-
cally  ignores C?M and R?L files, and six more file-excludes can be added,  to 
avoid  typing COM, CQM, CZM, REL, etc., files doesn't occur.   Here's  another 
menu command line (or it could be an alias) we call "e" for extract:

      e!if %t=lbr;jf -fm .* %$ *.* >>%n.jf;else;echo file not library;fi

Here,  all  files  in %$, library file you are pointing to  with  VFILER,  are 
unsqueezed and uncrunched as necessary, and appended into file named  "%n.jf".
File  has  type of JF with name of pointed-to library file.   The  two  right-
arrows cause appending, make it happen.
     Now,  say  file  ADDRESS.LST is a list of  names,  addresses,  and  phone 
numbers in, e.g., A4:, in a database with format, structure like this:

                               name
                               street
                               city and state
                               telephone number

To  find the entry for Davy Jones, use JetFind, setting the mode to r03 (a  4-
line   display,   starting  at  the  matching  line)  and  the   filelist   to 
A4:ADDRESS.LST.   Now if you, e.g., "save 47h address.com" just after  exiting 
JetFind, you can thereafter invoke clone with a minimum command such as

                           ADDRESS "DAVY JONES"<cr>

to find Davy Jones's address and phone number, or

                              ADDRESS JONES<cr>

to  find all the Joneses--we said JF makes us think it a database manager,  Z-
News 607-1.

        Of  course--to save disk space--aliases instead of  JF  clones 
        can be created to do database management things using just one 
        copy   of  default  JetFind  program.   Quantity  of   JetFind 
        parameter options permit near-infinite alias possibilities.

you can use JF for all kinds of interesting searches.  To find all five vowels 
in one line, i.e., in one word, in a-e-i-o-u order, use search expression:

              [^aeiou]*a[^aeiou]*e[^aeiou]*i[^aeiou]*o[^aeiou]*u

The  first component, "[^aeiou]*a", matches any non-vowel zero or more  times, 
and then matches the letter "a".  Remaining components do same for other  four 
vowels.   Above  expression  works for word lists, one word  per  line.    For 
searching  general,  more  than  one word per line  text  files,  start  above 
expression with "\<" and end it with "\>".
     And,  think of placing all your short text files into a library,  to  get 
them  out of the way and to save disk space.  Then use JetFind to locate,  and 
extract,  what  you need as you need it.  JF searches libraries as  easily  as 
regular  files.  And zip/area-code lists, think JetFind.  JF finds!   JetFind, 
Item 66 on our Price List, is but $39.95 plus S&H.

From  Our Mail Box.   "Thank you for a useful, informative, and  well-prepared 
newsletter.   I can read the type, the margins are excellent,  it  photocopies 
well--it  is  properly  done.  I appreciate it."  Kind  words  come  from  Don 
Halford, Boulder, CO, as he renewed his Z-News subscription.  Thanks, Don--you 
make our day!  As we say so often: we do what we can with resources at hand.
     Dr.  Joel  Tobias, Medford, OR, pokes us, "...recent  note  on  alcoholic 
preference...I  don't  know how anything useful is ever  accomplished  without 
Henry Winehart's Irish Ale."  Yea, that amber nectar, but don't forget the Tea 
brew,  roasted chicory root and crushed blackberry leaves!  Continuing, "I  am 
interested in banked ZRDOS when it becomes available...can finally get rid  of 
my Z80B and get an Hitachi...what S-100 SBC will be supported?"  We intend  to 
support all boards/computers using Hitachi HD64180 chip.
     "...pass along this letter to the writer of 'Of Angels and  Eagles'...the 
section  intrigues  me very much and it is also read by  the  complainers...it 
should always be remembered that the ONE who walked on water had his opponents 
but  he  persisted  and continued to... ," writes Lenn  Hunt,  Goodfield,  IL.
"Whatever a person's role is in the scheme of things, it seems to me that  the 
contentious are usually ill-informed about the situation or striving to offset 
some  effort for their own purposes.  Keep up your effort and vision  for  the 
future."   Lenn, we are neither mystic nor magician, jump through no rings  of 
fire--just concerned observers of our species.
     Rick Charnes, San Francisco, CA, writes ZCPR3/Z-System column for  Morrow 
Owner's  Review.  MOR is an all-CP/M publication addressing more  than  Morrow 
computers, but others as well.  Rick, as some of you know (TLF, TLIB, and  HD-
ARC2  author), is an avid Z-System user and a fast learner.   Subscription  to 
MOR is $18.00 per year, six issues.  Write P.O. Box 5487, Berkeley, CA  94705, 
or call 415/644-2638, to place order.
     Mike Richardson, Capitola, CA, writes to suggest we publish and  maintain 
a  catalog  of CP/M-compatible software from various vendors.  You,  write  us 
your thoughts about this.
     Many  letters  are received each fortnight, too many for  us  to  provide 
individual  replies.   We  use those (fragments)  of  general  interest  here.
Letters  coming into Echelon are read by several members of our staff  and  we 
respond  accordingly.   Even  though we don't respond  directly,  please  keep 
sending  us your thoughts, either by letter or as messages on Z-Node  Central.
We respond one way or another.

Z-User's  Corner.   For those with many COM files and aliases, and wishing  to 
conserve  disk space, using Jay Sage's ARUNZ is hard to beat.  Here is how  to 
do it with COMMAND.LBR and renaming ARUNZ.COM to CMDRUN.COM (Z-News  203-2,3), 
latter  being  default ZCPR3 extended command processor.   Create,  or  modify 
existing,  ALIAS.CMD  file  to  have a line for every COM  file  you  have  in 
COMMAND.LBR,  one alias-line per command.  For example, if your LBR  file  has 
these files in it, AN.COM, ASCII.COM, CPSEL.COM, DFA.COM, DUMP.COM, etc.,  fix 
ALIAS.CMD to have a line per command, script section that looks like this:

                        an ROOT:lx an $*
                        ascii ROOT:lx ascii
                        cpsel ROOT:lx cpsel $*
                        dfa ROOT:lx dfa $*
                        dump ROOT:lx dump $*
                           ....
                        z3loc ROOT:lx z3loc $*
                        : echo command "$0" not found;echo

LX runs COM files in COMMAND.LBR file.  LX, conventionally in directory ROOT:, 
is  used by ARUNZ (CMDRUN) to quickly execute command in COMMAND.LBR, also  in 
ROOT: directory.  If you enter dfa d3:*.*<cr> all file names in directory  D3: 
will  be  shown with current attributes.  "$*" gets expanded as  the  complete 
command  tail,  "$0"  is name of alias itself, both features  of  ZCPR3  alias 
parameter  passing.  ":" line is error handler, unique feature of  ARUNZ.   If 
command  needs  no tail, trailing attributes, then leave "$*" as we  did  with 
"ascii"   above.   (See  Z-News  508-2  for  summary  of   parameter   passing 
capabilities of Z-System utilities.)
     At EI, one computer presently has 62 COM files in COMMAND.LBR which  also 
has  alias  lines  to  cover each, along with  an  additional  20  independent 
aliases, in one 4k-byte ALIAS.CMD file in ROOT: directory.  On this particular 
4k  allocation  block  hard disk system these files  would  occupy  432k-bytes 
total.   But files actually occupy only 212k, for big savings.  Yes,  in  this 
real-world  example,  220k-bytes of disk space conserved  by  using  LX-ARUNZ-
CMDRUN-COMMAND.LBR  combination.  It is a way to organize your  computer...but 
there are many other ways, because of extreme flexibility provided by Z-System 
tools.  And more tools are in developmental pipeline.
     Here's  VFILER  CMD script line we use when we know  we  will  background 
print a file from Newword.  Command is <esc> followed by "b".

  b %d%u:;ROOT:ldr recorder.iop;record on p;BASE:nw %f;record off p;  <<
    ROOT:ldr bprinter.iop;bprint v printer.fil

Not  knowing if RECORDER.IOP is still loaded from cold-boot, alias  loads  it.
Newword  loads file pointed-to.  We edit, and then "^kd"; but before exit,  we 
enter  "p" followed by "^r" and "<esc>", for name of file we were pointing  to 
and  then  "print".  NW quickly "prints" to file PRINTER.FIL.  On  exit,  "x", 
from NW, B/Printer starts printing file to the printer.  We are now free to do 
as we will, reenter NW or use our computer in other ways.

                         Hot Tip For Users Of Newword
     NW  underlines white space between words with its ".ul  o"  command.  
     But underlining two or more words only works in right-margin  micro-
     justified  text  if  you use ^PO (fixed space  character,  see  NW's 
     built-in  ^P  help screen) as the space between words to  be  under-
     lined.  Else, fixed width spaces, as seen on CRT screen, are used by 
     NW as padding to achieve justification, instead of building  custom, 
     line by line, space character pad lengths as it normally does.

Another  Good  Book.   Early reports indicate  Addison-Wesley's  "MODULA-2:  A 
Seafarer's Manual and Shipyard Guide," by Edward J. Joyce, a seasoned salt and 
Modula-2  skipper,  is best choice for learning  high-level  languages.   Book 
costs  $16.95,  trade  paperback.   You can  order  directly  from  publisher.
Contact  Lynne Bolduc, 617/944-3700, extension 2614.  Please say Echelon  sent 
you.

Hot  Stuff.    Turbo Modula-2 is truly a sizzling dish, or is it  disk?.   For 
$69.95  you  receive a complete package for really quick,  compared  to  other 
high-level    language   environments,   application   program    development.
Interactive  two-way editor/compiler is a marvel to behold.  Edit your  source 
code,  compile,  and  at  first error, editor enters  source  code  at  flawed 
statement.   After fixing error, exit editor, and compiler continues where  it 
left off.  All automatically!
     Wow!   Here is way to quickly develop application programs using a  high-
level  language,  leaving C, BASIC, and Pascal behind.  Only full  Ada,  which 
executes slowly even on an Intel 80286-based machine, has "power" greater than 
Turbo  Modula-2.  Notice Telesoft Ada on a DEC VAX 11/780 runs BYTE  Sieve  of 
Eratosthenes,  Z-News  607-2  and 608-2, no faster than Turbo  Modula-2  on  a 
Micromint SB180FX.  See Z-News 604 for more Turbo language details.  Or  order 
552-page  User's Guide with 16-page Index and Table of Contents,  for  $19.95, 
plus $6.00 shipping and handling.
     Incidentally,  User's Guide editing, page makeup, laser typesetting,  and 
multi-color  cover design was done by Echelon staff in less than three  weeks.
Photo-reduction,  printing,  and bookbinding took an additional  four  weeks--
seven weeks total!
     Book  price  is  applicable  to  program  price  when  program  is  later 
purchased.   But  why not take-a-risk and order complete  program  now.   Call

Software Beat.   British company, Wordsmiths Typsetting Limited, Z-News 605-5, 
nears  completion (of new versions) of TypeFit along with TypeSet,  the  CP/M-
compatible programs connecting our wordprocessors to laser printers and  photo 
typesetters.   Handles  WordStar/Newword-type files.  Page makeup  drafts  and 
proofs can go to inexpensive, Epson-convention, dot matrix printers; when  you 
are satisfied with copy, send it to laser or typesetter.  TypeFit is  probably 
the  only  full-function copyfitting/typesetting package available  for  CP/M-
compatible  computers.   "We  believe that TypeFit offers a  real  and  proven 
alternative to the over-marketed and often unusable 'what-you-see-is-what-you-
get' approach," says Tom Graves, Wordsmiths' Technical Director.  "Because  it 
separates typography from text, it allows more freedom in structured  designs, 
making  it  more valuable in the editorial arena."  We are  reminded  of  text 
formatting  programs  (e.g.,  TROFF from Unix) as we learn  to  place  TypeSet 
commands  into files and use TypeFit to print.  Full control,  even  character 
kerning, of modern precision printers and typesetters is here.

In  Other  Words.    Japan is world's largest creditor  nation;  USA,  largest 
debtor nation.  One has the most money to lean, the other owes the most.  Will 
we  ever  learn  what brings happiness, fulfillment.  We spend  more  than  we 
possess;  we  buy on credit and become debtors; we live on  borrowed  time  of 
which  we  have  little  idea  of how  to  return  or  replace.   Consumption, 
materialism is near Pit's bottom.  Let us stand tall knowing of our deeds  and 
thoughts, not bent over chewing our shoes.
     We  spend, spend, spend...the Japanese save, save, save.  Saving,  leaves 
are  always  green on this tree.  When we owe we become slaves of the  God  of 
Repayment.

America.  Congratulations! 
==============================================================================
Of  Angels and Eagles.   Freedom is what we are all about.   Unrestrained,  we 
move  in directions of becoming more or becoming less than what  we  presently 
are.  We move to individual greatness or to individual shame--we choose  based 
on  our  vision.  But sickening it is to watch scandals of Wall  Street  (junk 
bonds  from junk people), governmental betrayals of trust, duplicity (we  bomb 
Libya,  sell  arms  to Iran), greed, greed, and more  greed,  indifference  to 
plight  of many, to watch lack of justice, too much violence, seeming lack  of 
learning  and understanding...same unacceptable level of man's  inhumanity  to 
man on so many places of our globe; but still, opportunities abound for  those 
few who appreciate high morality, have integrity to overcome temptations  that 
short-circuit  individual growth, to become more satisfied with their  lot  as 
Homo sapiens, to become thrice-sapient--so be it!  Victory over chaos, in  our 
time?  It is up to each of us.
     No snowflake in an avalanche admits causing it...no rain drop in a  flood 
claims  responsibility...what  we do is infinitesimal, but  it  is  infinitely 
important  that  we  do  it (Z-News 105-2,  506-5,  603-3).   People  who  are 
convinced  they  cannot  get control of their lives, cannot  control  how  the 
fruits  of  their  labors are employed, suffer from  what  Joseph  Weizenbaum, 
Massachusetts  Institute of Technology professor and  Artificial  Intelligence 
pioneer,  calls the "most pandemic mental illness of our time,"  i.e.,  belief 
that you are powerless.  What do you believe?
     We  do  it  again: use an expression and not give  its  meaning.   "Sauce 
Piquant."    Pray tell, what is it and how do you make it?  First, it is  used 
to  top-off tacos, to pour over boiled shrimp/crawfish, steamed  lobster,  and 
similar dishes.  Recipe:  mix 1/4 cup chopped onion and 1/4 cup chopped  green 
pepper;  add 1-1/2 cups diced ripe tomatoes, 2 tablespoons  chopped  pimiento, 
and  1/3  teaspoon powdered red pepper.  Stir thoroughly.  Makes  1-2/3  cups, 
enough for 10 Zydeco tacos.  Hint: most white Zinfandels have a little  citric 
acid  in them.  Such acid induces saliva to flow, producing a natural  cleaner 
and  cooling agent in the mouth.  Now, we listen to a Vera Lynn  record.   See 
you down the lines...
