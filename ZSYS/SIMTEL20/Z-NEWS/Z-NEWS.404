Z  TIPS.   Description of VMENU (and MENU) in Chapter 5 of ZCPR3:  The  Manual 
covers  most aspects of the program.  One thing not made clear is the  use  of 
SHCTRL  in connection with changing directories and file displays.   A  useful 
command  line  within VMN script is:  SHCTRL P;DU:;VMENU  *.*  fn.VMN.   Shell 
stack  is  popped;  next, log-in to pre-established directory  with  new  menu 
screen  with wild card file display of area.  Of course, put in  your  desired 
DU:, file mask for other than all files, and name of your VMN file.  Give menu 
line a one character (letter or digit, alphanumeric) name.
     Anyone  using  ZDMH debugger in interrupt-driven  systems,  e.g.,  SB180, 
should  make sure three locations: 0CB1H, 0CCAH, and 0E11H have  0FBH  values, 
not  standard  non-interrupt  0F3H.   Echelon  ZDM/ZDMZ/ZDMH  debugger  manual 
implies  these  changes have already been made--they have  not!   Simply  load 
ZDMH.COM  into  memory using ZDM.COM (or DDT.COM).  Using D  command,  display 
values.  If not 0FBH, change using S command.  Tip comes from ZDM author,  Bob 
Doolittle.   "Changes  keep interrupts enabled at all times.   You  can  still 
disable  interrupts with the DI command when entering the target  program  but 
they  will  be  enabled again when ZDMH regains  control."   Bob,  thanks  for 
information.

More  Graphics.  Untouched film-strip photographs of a Wyse 50+  amber  screen 
clearly  show straight lines, boxes, windows, and pull down menus provided  by 
Echelon  graphics routines.  Graphics package is offered for $49.00 with  how-
to-use  documentation,  Item 28 on EI Price List.  Don't  forget  to  download 
graphics demo from your local Z-Node.  Look for file GRDEMO.LBR.  Enjoy.


"Five CRT screen photos showing graphics and windows."


Incidentally,  file  ZL.ZEX in GRDEMO.LBR is a good example by  ZRDOS  author, 
Dennis  Wright, of a "quiet" ZEX batch processing file.  Many of you have  had 
trouble getting ZEX to do what you wished; ZL.ZEX may be of assistance in your 
search for quiet.

Z-Node  Activity.   More nodes going online.  Clinton Cook, Merced, CA  95348, 
converts  his  existing  RAS (remote access system) to become  Node  #54  with 
209/383-6417  modem number.  Clinton runs an Ampro with 10 megabytes  of  hard 
disk storage.
     Roger  Warren,  San Diego, CA 92109, takes over Z-Node #9  with  619/270-
3148,  assisting  coverage of vast state of California.  Roger  also  runs  an 
Ampro.   (What  would  our  world  be  like  without  Little  Board  computing 
machines!)
     Ron  Stone,  Z-Node  #5, Lisle, IL, puts  40  megabytes  online.   Z-Node 
Central  goes  to 20 megabytes.  More files and data, data and  files.   Where 
does it lead; to increased understanding, to wisdom?  We WONDER.
     Speaking  of more, ZCPRM3/B3 and ZRDOS3 (Z-News 401) will permit  several 
callers to simultaneously communicate with a single-computer RAS.  Of  course, 
RAS must employ multiple phone lines--new era for Z-Nodes and 8-bit BBSs  soon 
begins.

Amateur  Z  User's  Corner.   ASCII (American Standard  Code  for  Information 
Interchange)  can  be either 7 or 8 bits for data.  The rest  of  transmission 
byte  (word in this case) consists of start, stop (could be two),  and  parity 
bits.  Start and stop bits are used to establish beginning and ending of  each 
word.   That's  simple  enough  but the parity bit  is  usually  a  source  of 
confusion, to anyone not already having an understanding.
     The parity bit may be used simply to make the word length correct for the 
transmission protocol.  Then it's fixed, included as "mark" or "space."  Terms 
mark  and space are carry-overs from the days of teletypewriters (TTY).   Mark 
is high or true bit state, loop current flowing, i.e., a one; space, a zero or 
false  state.   Parity, when actively used, tells of a  possible  transmission 
error at the receiving terminal.  Value of parity bit is determined by sum  of 
bits  in  particular  byte,  and  may be either  odd  or  even,  depending  on 
convention selected.
     Even  parity tells receiving computer that data bits in transmitted  word 
add  up to an even number, i.e, number of ones and number of zeros sum  to  an 
even  number, 2, 4, or 6.  On receive, if sum is not even, an  error  probably 
occurred.   The parity bit on transmit is made either a one or a zero to  make 
the sum even.  The letter "A" would be sent as 01000001 and the letter "C"  as 
11000011.   Without  even parity, it would be 01000011, standard  ASCII  8-bit 
value.
     Most  microcomputing  systems  don't use  parity  to  catch  transmission 
errors,  but  instead use a block (a group of bytes, usually 128 bytes  up  to 
packets  of  16k-bytes) error detection method called CRC,  cyclic  redundancy 
check.  CRC provides more reliable indication of errors existing in a block of 
bytes than possible with parity checking.  Presently, CRC methods are used for 
disk  data recording and telephone communication checking and  co-exists  with 
parity-bit testing, latter mainly for solid state memory (RAM) checking.

From  Our  Mail  Box.    Ron Crain (32881  Robinhood,  Birmingham,  MI  48010, 
313/646-5159)  has  installed ZCPR3 on both a CompuPro 85/88  and  an  Otrona.
"Even though Otrona is out of business, an Attache with the Z-System is  about 
the  most  effective portable around."  Ron, please  make  both  installations 
available  by  placing  instructions and necessary programs in  LBR  file  and 
uploading  to  Z-Node  Central.  Of course, leave ZRDOS out of  upload,  as  a 
license  is required for its use.  We encourage free distribution among  users 
of  ZCPR3  installations  to  promote having it run on  as  many  machines  as 
possible.   Also, Ron is looking for WordStar/LaserJet page printer  software.
We suggest Newword; see Z-News 402 and 403 for more details.
     "I  gather that some people are unaware that Rick Conn's  original  ALIAS
(requiring custom assembly for each system) is the only one (as far as I know) 
which  does not require an initialized environment, therefore is  most  useful 
for  creating STARTUP.COM without having to initialize ENV in BIOS.  Might  be 
worth  a mention."  Note comes from Dreas Nielsen, Corvallis, OR.   Yes,  this 
clears up a mystery that many have wondered about.
     "What  terminals  can your graphics package be used with?"  asks  Malcolm 
Aukerman (Newport, IN).  We are compiling a list of terminals that work, first 
with  graphics  and second, handle windows.  Task is not  trivial  because  we 
haven't   been  able  to  find  an  up-to-date  single-source   for   terminal 
information.   (We  own two copies of "A Programmer's Guide to  Video  Display 
Terminals," by David Stephens, but more details are required than these  books 
contain.)  We are working with terminal vendors now and hopefully will receive 
sufficient  information from them to develop a comprehensive,  accurate  list.
Stay with us.
     "The  May/June issue of Micro/Systems Journal will carry  a  construction 
article  on  how to build an HD64180 S-100 CPU card the easy way.   You  might 
want  to tell your newsletter readers to look for it."  Sol Libes, Editor  and 
Co-Publisher  writes.   "We would be interested in doing a review  of  the  Z-
System.   Let  me  know  if you are  interested."   Yes,  we  are  interested.
Certainly someone will volunteer to write.
     Many  have  asked, "Why get Discat when NCAT is in  the  public  domain?"
Several reasons: 1) Discat is much faster in handling catalogs with more  than 
about  50  diskettes, because of efficient database technique and the  use  of 
working  catalog concept.  Really quick updates are made to  working  catalog.
When computer has nothing more pressing to do, working catalog is merged  with 
one  or more master catalogs.  Yes, more than one master catalog is  possible.
2)  Discat software modules work together like other Z-System  utilities,  are 
screen-oriented  and  installed  with Z3INS.  Menus, either  MENU,  VMENU,  or 
VFILER  CMD,  are used to control all functions, from putting names  on  disk, 
updating  catalogs,  to removing names.  Every operation may be  from  command 
line  or  performed from a menu, one you can easily change.   3)  You  support 
Echelon,  the company that continues to support 8-bit  upward-compatible  CP/M 
world.  (Review Z-News 401 for our plans.)  Most others have abandoned origins 
of  microcomputing to pursue simply making money; they troop  (Zeffirelli,  Z-
News  304).  We strive to achieve something higher, with making money a  fall-
out; we believe you agree with our philosophy.
     From  Charlotte, NC, Mr. Carey Dowd writes, "Please ask Echelon staff  to 
take  it easy on the Zinfandel--my local merchant is out!"  We are told  staff 
uses only as much Zinfandel as they need to get through the day, to make rough 
places plain.

Potpourri.   Idea-processing program, called Out-Think, offered in streamlined 
version  for only $49.95 (Z-News 007).  Runs on any ZCPR3, Z-System,  or  CP/M 
2.2  system that has at least 48k-bytes of TPA memory, and 200k-bytes of  disk 
storage.   Now  here's  a bargain--greatly  assists  organizing  thoughts  and 
textual material.  New version is more memory-based than original, much faster 
and easier to both understand and use.  Call or write Kamasoft, Inc. (formerly 
Compusophic  Systems),  2525 S.W. 224th Ave., Aloha, OR  97006,  503/649-3765.
They accept credit card orders.
     Those  wishing to obtain literature on Kodak flexible disk  drives,  2.8, 
5.2,  and 10.0 megabytes of formatted storage mentioned in Z-News 309,  should

Comment  Line.    When  we  started Z-News nearly  two  years  ago  many  said 
supplying  information to customers every two weeks was over-doing  it.   Most 
companies have newsletters that come out every three months, some not at  all.
We  thought  our  community  deserved something  more--so  a  fortnighter  was 
conceived  and born.  We regret not that moment our spirit was driven to  such 
lengths:  a fortnighter.  It sounded good to us then, and still does now.
     Our  culture is undergoing a radical change and many see it  not.   Those 
that  have  lost their jobs, jobs no longer necessary because  of  changes  in 
technology, they know of what we speak.  Labor is so cheap "off-shore" we  can 
not  use  USAians  in many tasks that Orientals can do.  Our  world  is  small 
because  of  jet airplane travel and satellite communications,  goods  can  be 
produced and shipped here at lower cost than we can make them ourselves.   Our 
work  ethic  is  such we have trouble striving for improved  ways  to  produce 
higher  and higher quality.  Orientals are just becoming materialistic, as  we 
have  been for 50 or more years--we are jaded, but still appreciate value  and 
quality.  As we stated in Z-News 308, "Reason we buy Japanese imports is  same 
reason  they  wouldn't  buy  ours, no matter how fair  and  easy  the  marking 
channels.   Ignore scape-goats, increase value."  We investigate same  subject 
from  many angles in other newsletters, always with one view:  it's up to  you 
and me.  We are IT.  
     We  have  come  far  without  much  understanding  primarily  because  of 
blessings of heritage, our natural location with resources of water, land, and 
weather.  We are rich because of them and much inefficiency could, until  now, 
be  tolerated and still we were superior.  But no more.  New thinking and  new 
ways  are  needed if we are to stay superior.  We welcome  thoughts  on  these 
matters.  See you down the lines...
