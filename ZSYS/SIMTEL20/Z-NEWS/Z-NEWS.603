Z Tips.   Softaid, Inc., 8930 Route 108, Columbia, MD 21045, 800-433-8812  (in 
Maryland,  301/964-8455),  offers "64180 Basic" compiler for  computers  using 
Hitachi HD64180 high-integration microprocessor chip.  (Softaid is famous  for 
their MTBasic multitasking compiler and Z80 "I.C.E. Box" tester.)  64180 Basic 
permits   running   32  programs  of  up  to   32k-bytes   each   concurrently 
(multitasking),  using  up  to one megabyte of physical  memory  space.   (New 
Hitachi  HD64180  chip manages this much memory from  on-chip.)   All  context 
switching  is  performed by compiler, no special hardware  or  other  software 
needed.  Up to ten windows can be on screen simultaneously.  One window can be 
overlayed by another, and overlayed windows can later be restored, making  pop 
up and pop down menus a breeze to implement.  Each window can be assigned to a 
different  task (program), or multiple windows can be assigned to  each  task.
For  real-time  applications, has built-in interrupt handling.   Compiler  has 
emulating debugger built-in and optionally produces ROMable code.  BYTE  maga-
zine  Sieve  benchmark  runs in 32 seconds (ten iterations)  using  6.144  mHz 
clock,  16  seconds with 12.288 mHz.  (MBasic tests at 1008 and  504  seconds, 
Assembler  at 4.7 and 2.4 seconds, respectively, using SemiDisk  DT42  HD64180 
single  board computer, description in Z-News 502, benchmarks in 409 and  501.
See Z-News 601-3 for description of Zedcor's ZBasic compiler.)  Compiles  over 
100  statements  per second.  Sounds wonderful and it is--sells  for  $450.00.

SUS  Update.    Here's how directory of Software Update  Service  diskette  #6 
looked at shipping time:

See Z-User's Corner below for FF and FINDF26A discussion, Z-News 602 for  more 
on contents of SUS #6.  Alias SAP/SYS.COM is CLEANDIR used sequentially on all 
drives  of your system.  You should customize the alias script to  match  your 
hardware  and desires.  Above DEFAULT.VZN is new, small changes from  original 
reflect reaction to additional features of new VMENU.  (We keep both VMENU.COM 
and DEFAULT.VMN in A15:ROOT directory.)  AC44 has only reported bug fixed, and 
also has a misleading message recast.  ZLBR is a library and command interface 
shell  by  Terry Carroll (Bedford, TX, Z-Node #56), based  on  John  Poplett's 
ZLUX.   (More  on ZLBR and ZLUX in a future Z-News.)  MCOPY45 has a  few  bugs 
removed and a little better logic applied.  Both Michael Bate (Cambridge,  MA) 
and Terry Carroll had a hand in these changes.

From Our Mail Box.   "I don't want to miss an issue of your newsletter.   Keep 
up the good work!" writes Tim Kondek, Diamond Bar, CA.  We do the best we can, 
Tim.   Only  wish more people would subscribe to it.  But we are  thankful  to 
those  who  have.   We need more support than we have  been  receiving.   "The 
fields are white unto the harvest, but the workers are few."

Z-Node Activity.   Lots of VMENU, VFILER activity indicated by program changes 
appearing on Z-Nodes.  Michael Bate, Terry Carroll, Bob Peddicord (Z-Node #60, 
Selma  OR),  and Jay Sage (Z-Node #3, Newton Centre, MA) continue  to  enhance 
these  major ZCPR3 utilities.  Both programs have so many new features we  let 
you  discover them by reading their respective DOC and HLP files, from SUS  #6 
or downloading from Z-Nodes.  (We have two versions of VMENU because they were 
not checked out of Z-Node Central as requested in Z-News 301-3.  Believe VMENU 
v2.2b is going far-afield from tool concept we originally had in mind for  it. 
Remember,  VFILER can be used from VMENU (and MENU).  Perhaps we  should  name 
versions  from 1.9 and beyond, e.g., VMMGR, for Video Menu Manager,  and  keep 
VMENU simple.)

Z-User's  Corner.   FF.COM, Find File alias using FIND26A, pokes your  SYS.ENV 
segment  that resides in high memory for maximum drive to search.  Address  to 
change, i.e., poke, is xx2c, where xx is your environmental base page in  hex, 
and  2c is offset from base.  Common base is FE, e.g., for SB180,  Ampro,  and 
CCS  machines.   Maximum drive translation is A=1, B=2, C=3,  ...,  P=16.   FF 
alias  is used where file search is desired of less than every  online  drive.
As an example, we search only A through D, but E and F are also online.

        if nul $1;echo syntax: ff [d:]afn,afn,... [p[s]]<cr>;else;  <<
        poke fe2c 4;ROOT:findf26a $*;poke fe2c 6;fi

Syntax is verb followed by optional drive, required file name or names (search 
mask,  wild  cards permitted), and optional no-paging and show  system  files, 
e.g.:  ff a:*.var,dir.com ps<cr>.  Here drive A is searched for all  files  of 
type  VAR  and  for location of file DIR.COM.  All user  areas  are  searched.
Paging  is  turned  off and system files are displayed if  they  match  search 
names.   A  more normal search would simply be, e.g., ff  z*.*<cr>  where  all 
files  starting  with letter z would be found on all drives and in  all  users 
areas, i.e., in all directories.  If only "ff<cr>" is entered, syntax  message 
from  within alias is displayed.  "ff //<cr>" produces built-in help  directly 
from FINDF26A.COM.  Wow!  Such friendliness.

FINDF, Version 2.6
 Find files on all drives or on a specific drive
  Syntax: FINDF [D: or DIR:]afn,afn,afn,... o..
  Options: P - Paging Option Off
           S - Include System Files

     FINDF26A is slick--adds lots of features to make our lives more pleasant, 
thanks  to  Howard Goldstein and Jay Sage, and of course to Richard  Conn  who 
created  the  search  technique  to begin with.  1)  Found  files  display  in 
standard  prompt format using two columns, showing up to 40 names per  screen; 
2)  pages,  trailing p turns it off, to handle situations that  overflow  onto 
next screen; 3) finds "system" files, if trailing s is used and if WHEEL  byte 
is  set;  4) ^C aborts drive search then goes to the next (if  one);  and,  5) 
single-drive  search  (thanks to Joe Wright for this).  All  useful  features.
Also  v2.6a  displays  found-files correctly even if named  directory  is  not 
present.
     To  a  lighter side.  Most of us have studied long and hard to  learn  Z-
System  and these days many have a warm feeling about Z-System  documentation.
"The  reference manual, although comprehensive and authoritative,  is  totally 
incomprehensible  to  any one who does not already have some  experience  with 
operating systems.  The user's guide is an insult to the average user's intel-
ligence and does not cover nearly enough of the useful operations."  From  Ted 
Mirecki,  reviewing  IBM-produced PC DOS documentation, in  PC  Tech  Journal, 
October  1986  issue, starting page 100.  Ted goes on to say that  EDLIN,  the 
editor  supplied  with PC DOS, is a total "embarrassment" and is used  by  few 
users.  Just maybe our community is better than IBM at writing about operating 
systems  and creating quality editors.  Pray, who is embarrassed by LZED,  the 
full-screen  Z-System  editor?  (PC DOS, latest Version 3.2, appears  to  have 
only 37 external utilities, Z-System has over 100.)

Lunch  Break.    We  are  excited to announce Echelon  has  been  selected  as 
exclusive  agents  for Borland International's Turbo Modula-2 for  Z-80  CP/M-
compatible  microcomputers.   Price  is  $69.95  with  near  500-page  manual.
Program  has  all  the features of Turbo Pascal and extended  worth  of  being 
Modula-2.  Like other Turbo products, tremendous price to performance  ratio--
go  for  it!  Micromint will be sole source for a special version  running  on 
their SB180.  More about Turbo Modula-2 features and the shipping date next Z-
News.
     It's  not the years, it's the mileage.  You have heard  such  expressions 
most of your life...mileage refers to "deep" living.  Deep...yes, meaning more 
conscious  living; less habit-induced, instinctive habit-reaction;  and,  more 
intuitive, thoughtful action.  Quality living, not simply putting in time.  So 
many seem to have as goal "the easy life."  But what is such a life?   Staying 
in  bed all day, not confronting problems?  Turning off our brains with  drugs 
and  slothfulness and being more vegetable than human?  Or is the easy  (good) 
life a psychological transformation to self-knowledge?  You tell us.
     "Supply creates demand."--a famous quotation, and generally held true  in 
economic,  financial  circles.  But if such were universally true,  would  not 
computers other than IBM be dominant?  Though "clones" are now outselling  Big 
Blue, how long does this continue as the "closed" 80386 PC enters  production?
Nonetheless, Apple does reasonably well (making money) with Macintosh (tm) and 
their  new  IIgs  machines.  Certainly these are computers  in  great  supply, 
manufactured  using  latest robotic and "slave-labor"  production  techniques.
Supply is abundant, demand only moderate.  Why?
     Everyone likes surprises, and many surprises are pleasant.  But few  like 
unpleasant  surprises,  especially desktop computer users.   We  want  instant 
knowledge, instant success, and everything, software and hardware,  performing 
as we think it should.  Else, we fret!  Blame goes to everyone and  everything 
except  ourselves.   We  want  benefits  without  paying  appropriate  price--
something  for nothing!  When it comes to learning, many seem to  need  spoon-
feeding.   And,  like  babies, when not getting what is  expected,  a  tantrum 
follows.   What  has  happened to pioneering spirit, that  spirit  of  experi-
mentation  majority of us still possess.  We use it not?  Even if actions  are 
later determined to be wrong or less than optimum, much comes from  attempting 
to do.  Doing, attempting to do, sure way to learning.  From our mistakes,  we 
henceforth know what not to do.  Experiment!  See what happens...especially if 
actions  have  no  irreversible consequences, as is true  with  most  computer 
commands.  But, make not the same mistake twice.  But, on the other hand...
     ====================================================================
Of  Angels and Eagles.   Managers and executives are taught, usually by  word-
of-mouth,  "It's better to do something, even if wrong, than to  do  nothing."
Action is more important than inaction.  Lack of action is viewed as error, or 
incompetence.   Wrong, wrong...wrong!  What we do, especially if  wrong,  does 
little good, but infinitely important that we do it none the less, and  indeed 
may  have  short-term  harmful  effects in  many  business  situations.   Know 
consequences  of  all actions, good and bad, right and wrong, short  term  and 
long. Investigate thoroughly before doing, acting or reacting.
     Conscious  of time and place, seeing...Silicon Valley, '78 to  '84,  egos 
and self ran wild!  Then, shortsightedness controlled, for the most part,  and 
still does.  Everything was to be done now, forget doing it right, just get it 
done  now.  But...a new maturity, one based on long-range survival  instincts, 
surfaces.   Value  of intuition starts to surface, becomes  important!   Short 
views start to fall from grace--long-range planning takes on new statue.

       We fear not Tomorrow...for we know Yesterday and cherish Today.
              We give Thanks...for the Beauty of this Moment.

Now, the Zinfandel, but just a taste--no more!  See you down the lines...
