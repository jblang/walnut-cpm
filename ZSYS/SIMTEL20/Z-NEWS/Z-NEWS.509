Z  Tips.    LX versus LRUNZ.  Renaming either to CMDRUN  permits  running  COM 
files  from within COMMAND.LBR without declaring their LX or LRUNZ name.   But 
LX  has  extended  capability to run files contained in  any  library  on  any 
directory  accessed from any directory.  For example: lx xdir  HELP:*.h?p<cr>.
From any directory at command line, LX runs XDIR.COM contained in  COMMAND.LDR 
in  A15:ROOT.   Here XDIR lists all HLP type files found in  HELP:  directory, 
which  by  convention is A12:.  (If LX.COM is renamed to CMDRUN.COM,  LX  verb 
need not be declared.)  Using LX, access to libraries other than  conventional 
default  COMMAND.LBR  is  obtained  by a  dash  placed  immediately  ahead  of 
directory  and  library name.  lx -b9:asm libzas<cr>  command  causes  program 
LIBZAS  to  run from ASM.LBR in directory B9:.  Caveat: you must  declare  the 
directory, either du or dir form, even if library is on logged-in directory.

     Those  interested in assembling a computer using a Single-Board  Computer 
are encouraged to study Volume 2, Issue 2 of Computer Smyth Magazine, pages 26 
through  29.  Editor, Edward Dell finds Ampro's Z80 Little Boards ideal  mates 
to  Integrand's cabinets and power supplies.   Easy-to-put-together  Integrand 
Laser  Series  cabinets,  attractively styled and finished,  are  perfect  for 
office,  lab,  and home.  We have long recommended both  Ampro  and  Integrand 
products  to  those  wanting  to learn about  hardware,  how  to  construct  a 
computer.   Four  Integrand-based machines work at Echelon  offices--each  put 
together  in  a  couple of hours once we had all piece  parts  in  hand,  disk 
drives, cables, connectors, nuts, screws, and washers.  We are more than happy 
with  results.   See  Z-News 207 and 502 for more on  Integrand  and  Computer 
Smyth.  Ampro is reached at P.O. Box 390427, Mountain View, CA 94039, 415/962-

     Version  1.3 of Term3, our Z-System communications package, is  shipping.
Many  small  enhancements (and bugs found, removed)  have  been  incorporated.
Updates cost $20.00 plus $4.00 shipping and handling, continental USA--no need 
to send in your diskette masters, just your money.
     AC, Version 4.3, is released.  It's on upcoming SUS #5 diskette.   Dennis 
Wright makes tool ideal for copying and archiving files.  Look at the  options 
for partial or complete backup of disk and partition.  AC //<cr> produces:

 AC - Archive Copy Utility, Version 4.3
  Syntax:
        AC [dir:]new.typ=[dir:]old.typ /ooo...
   or   AC [dir:]old.typ [dir:]new.typ /ooo...
  Options:
        A - Archive option.  Only non-archived files are copied.
            Upon completion, source is archived.
        B - Backup complete disk.  Same as using options A and G.
        E - Erase source option.  Upon copy completion, source file
            is deleted (move option).
        G - Global selects all user areas on source and destination.
        N - No verify option.  Copied files are not verified.
        O - Overwrite any duplicate files in destination directory
            without asking.
        Q - Query option.  User is queried before each copy.
        R - Reset before copy option.  User is prompted following disk
            changes before copy operation begins.  After user response,
            disk system is reset.

On copying files, AC sets "archive" bit in each file's name.  (PROTECT and SFA 
can  also set this bit.  DFA displays file attributes.)  When AC is used  with 
"A"  or  "B" option, files that have not been archived or  have  been  changed 
since  last  AC  archive operation are copied  automatically  from  source  to 
destination.  Think of neat aliases we can create!

SUS  Report.    First  four Software Update  Service  diskettes  contain  many 
significant offerings, programs talked about in previous newsletters.   (Guess 
the utility used to print below directories, print-out here slightly edited.)

Z-News 507 (and 506) contains full details of SUS principles.  We urge you  to 
subscribe  if you cannot economically download from Z-Node RASs--it's the  way 
to  stay current, so important considering present quantity of changes  in  Z-
System software and community.
     Caveat: TXTTWS, Text to WordStar translation program, requires file to be 
converted fit completely in memory.  Files longer than about 36k-bytes  should 
be divided before conversion is attempted.  (TXTTWS, in general, needs  better 
error trapping and reporting.)

From  Our Mail Box.   John Linnell, Etobicoke, Ontario, writes,  "Al  Dunsmuir 
has been out of circulation for the last few months but said the other evening 
that  he  was  going to get back at it [programming on  ZEX32?].   ...and  how 
about,  say  monthly, using a middle page for latest price lists.   Be  a  big 
help."   We  respond by inserting our Price List #11.  Place your  next  order 
today,  John.  PRICESnn.EI are on Z-Nodes everywhere for downloading and  show 
our  current  prices, terms and conditions.  "nn" reflects  version  level  of 
file.
     From  downunder,  John  Foat, Melbourne, Australia, asks  us  to  seek  a 
"gofer"  to gather files, put on disks, and mail to him and Mick Stock,  Sysop 
of  Mitcham  RCP/M.  Seems our two Australian Z-Nodes are long  distance  from 
Melbourne.  And, long distance phone charges are $2.00 per minute, $120.00 per 
hour.  Wow!  We think we have problems.  Solution, John, is a subscription  to 
EI Software Update Service.  All the latest material is placed on diskette and 
mailed  out  once a month, or so.  (See above and Z-News 506  and  507.)   SUS 
should  greatly  improve  distribution  of  Z-System  software  to  those   in 
geographical areas neither immediate nor convenient to a Z-Node.
    Fred  Haines,  Los Angeles, CA, points out that Irv Hoff's  FIND,  Version 
5.4,  finds  text  strings fast.  We remember it as a program  to  search  for 
entries  in  NEWCAT, the public domain disk catalog program.  Well,  we  down-
loaded  the  version  and noticed it was copyrighted by Irv.   FIND54  is  not 
"public  domain."  We tested it on one of our Ampro Bookshelf  computers,  one 
with 20 megabyte Seagate 225N hard disk and Fujitsu (not Canon) 6ms  step-rate 
48tpi  DSDD  floppy.   On  our two-file  15-character  benchmark,  search  was 
completed in 9.56 seconds on the HD and 17.38 seconds on the floppy.  Or about 
three  times faster than the commercial C Language search programs  of  Z-News 
303,  505, and 506.  What we have previously said, "Assembler is  three  times 
faster  than  C."   Code density: SIFT, with  similar  capability  to  FIND54, 
occupies 148 records versus 22 of FIND54.  Another example of density: our WC, 
Word Count, in C is 38 records long, the one in Assembler by Oasis Systems  is 
8.   But  still,  there  are places for  a  high-level  programs  like  Dennis 
O'Neill's  Electra-Find--we  shudder to think what it takes to write  such  an 
elegant  utility in Assembler.  (Eric Gans' find-and-replace FINREP tested  at 
10.31 and 25.70 seconds; Sigi Kluger's find-and-unsqueeze FINDU, at 24.02  and 
33.31.)  We linger until Richard Conn finishes FINDStm before making  conclud-
ing search-program statements.  Thanks, Fred, for making our day.

Z-User's  Corner.    ZEX,  Z-System EXecutive, has  power  to  automate  tasks 
requiring  application program character input, normally supplied by  operator 
from keyboard.  With ZEX, inputs and prompts supplied by specifics of  script, 
extremely complex procedures, ones requiring many keystrokes to implement, are 
developed and then used over and over.  Script: scene, view of things  happen-
ing,  to  come, or caused to happen.  Script is usually text processed  by  an 
executive, a program understanding specific script language.  VFILER  executes 
VFILER.CMD  script;  ARUNZ, ALIAS.CMD; and ZCPR3's  command  processor,  ALIAS 
script  (here, script has been converted into executable object code,  into  a 
COM  file, by alias editor ALIAS, BALIAS, TALIAS, or VALIAS).   ZEX  processes 
and recognizes many control functions (all show from built-in help using  con-
ventional double forward slash after verb, ending with carriage return).   ZEX 
script  can direct your computer to perform desired tasks.  Using ZEX  from  a 
controlling  alias completes automation process, as we did with PR  multi-copy 
print routine in Z-News 109.
                     -----------------------------------
     We goofed in our WF, Word Frequency, alias under ARUNZ, Z-News 507-1.  We 
believe  we now have one without blemish.  The previous WF  required  file-to-
process be on default drive, because Oasis Systems's WORDFREQ does not  under-
stand user areas and our script was deficient in handling situation correctly.
ALIAS.CMD line reads:

wf if $1=//;echo $0 - word frequency;echo syntax: $0 [du:]<fn.ft><cr>;  <<
else;$d1$u1:;ROOT:lx wordfreq $:1.$.1;ROOT:sak strike any key;          <<
ROOT:vtype $:1.frq;era $:1.frq;$d0$u0:;fi

Power of ARUNZ's parameter passing shows; thank Jay Sage for fine tool  design 
and coding.  Study ARUNZ.HQP for details of features of ARUNZ.COM.   "$:1.$.1" 
is fn.ft, used to get around optional passing of DU: in $1 to WORDFREQ.  "$d1" 
and "$u1" are drive/user area optionally declared, i.e., declared if needed to 
access  file,  with its name and type.  "$d0$u0:" is default  drive/user  area 
from  which  alias was called.  Notice we logged  into  directory  file-to-be-
processed  is in with "$d1$u1:" statement.  What a flexible, complete  set  of 
parameters!   We execute ARUNZ alias by calling normal alias, also  named  WF, 
containing:  ROOT:arunz wf $1.  Couldn't be much simpler.  Typing WF fn.ft<cr> 
does the job, if fn.ft is in default directory.  Else declare drive/user  area 
in front of fn.ft.
     Now, who in Z-Community writes a Z-Tool to replace WORDFREQ, one that has 
built-in help and recognizes user areas and named directories?  We need such a 
program  for our soon-to-be-offered Writer's Tool Box Package.  Program  needs 
to 1) count number of words in selected file, 2) determine vocabulary of file, 
i.e.,  count number of unique words, 3) count number of words used only  once, 
4)  place  above three in table and show on CRT screen, and 5)  create  sorted 
file  of  words in single column with count of how many times  each  different 
word is used.  Here, straight coding in Modula II or C Language does not  do--
too slow for what is needed, compared to Assembler.
     What  do you do when both resident and transient of same name are  needed 
in  an alias, menu, or ZEX script...well, notice ECHO in SEE alias  of  Z-News 
508.   By declaring where transient is, no path search is made;  moreover,  no 
check for resident command in CCP or RCP/FCP is performed by ZCPR3.  For  some 
time we successfully used IF12.COM in conjunction with FCP-resident IF.  Using 
different  names  is  a solution, though we prefer using du/dir  in  front  of 
program  name,  mainly for increased access speed.  SYSFCP, Version  1.4,  has 
enough intelligence to check if transient function is available when requested 
internal,  resident  flow  function is not found.   Another  point:  transient 
commands have built-in help.  If directory is declared, CCP by-passes resident 
function and goes directly to indicated transient.  Thus du:<cmd> //<cr>  gets 
transient help instead of, without du/dir, trying to get non-existent resident 
help.
     Bob  Peddicord, Selma, OR, Z-Node #60 Sysop, finishes VMENU, Version  18.
Nearly  finished.   All we need now is a way to have program pop  shell  stack 
when  moving  from  one directory to another and not have  to  use  disk-based 
SHCTRL.   A couple of seconds or so would be saved in the moving.  Also,  with 
this  version, you use the same VMN name for all Vmenu files, ones you  intend 
to  move  among,  on your disk system.  The name used  on  entering  VMENU  is 
retained as you manually move, by using L command, or equivalent, shown in  Z-
News 508-4, from directory to directory.  Concept is similar to VFILER and its 
CMD--one  per  directory,  all having the same name.  But in  case  of  VMENU, 
Version 18, the name is to your choosing and you can start from different menu 
VMN names--lots of flexibility here.
     SH, GETVAR, RESOLVE, ARUNZ, VFILER, MENU, and VMENU pass variables,  lots 
of them.  Variables are symbols whose values are determined by context  (their 
scope)  in  which they are used.  Things (objects) represented,  replaced  by, 
resolved  into  other things, these are variables.  Relationship  of  variable 
names to their meanings is determined by binding processes.  SHDEFINE produces 
a  list  of variables and what they are replaced with, what they  mean,  i.e., 
their bindings.  Matching parameters to bindings is called unification, usual-
ly  performed by applying some form of logic.  As you use GH alias, of  Z-News 
507-3,  variable  "ghelp" takes on the name of the help  file  you  requested.
RESOLVE  (and  SH)  gets a variable, determines current  meaning  by  checking 
SH.VAR  file,  and  passes meaning to calling executive,  usually  a  multiple 
command  line of an alias, a menu, or a shell of one form or  another.   Vari-
ables  bridge (bind) shells.  See Z-News 204-3 for more details  about  varia-
bles, arguments, and parameters.
     Our  language reflects our knowledge, our understanding, and finally  our 
wisdom.   We search, yearn for ultimates and absolutes...they must exist  else 
we would have not words, a vocabulary describing them...time for lunch.

Lunch Break.   Z-System aliases and other script are generally unknown to  the 
public  at large but nonetheless comprise an important and newsworthy part  of 
our  computer culture.  Most magazine editors consider what we do  a  dead-end 
street.  If you don't, submit an article or a letter to a selected one.   Give 
details  of impressive features of Z-System and make comparisons to  Unix,  PC 
DOS, and to your ideal operating system.  We wish you to share your ideas with 
others,  with  us.  If you have better solutions to task  automation  than  we 
present, alias, menu, or ZEX file, please send them along.  Also, if you  have 
a  problem  looking  for a solution, by all means send it in.   We  thrive  on 
problems.
     SemiDisk DT42 update.  Both boards near production state.  First  version 
of  BIOS  controls primary functions of board-pair, is  essentially  finished.
Contact SemiDisk Systems (Z-News 502-2) for current status and other details.
     Matsushita,  Japan's  fifth largest  semiconductor  manufacturer,  claims 
their  4-megabit DRAM chips should be available for sampling in less  than  18 
months.   Seems they are letting Toshiba, another Japanese chip  manufacturer, 
have  the 1-meg market in hopes of being first with even more  dense  devices.
We  understand their 4-megabit design (0.8 micron CMOS technology) is  capable 
of  expanding to 16 (0.5 micron).  Such densities permit SemiDisk's  DT42  RAM 
board  to hold half gigabyte (500,000,000 bytes--500 million) of fast  memory.
What a bright future!
     Having  instructional material online is one thing, but having  the  same 
material  printed and available in full-sized loose-leaf note books  is  quite 
another.  Information converted to knowledge, our immediate goal.  Understand-
ing  comes later.  Big loose-leaf binders are just-the-ticket to learn  effic-
iently  while working the computer.  Pull-down windows don't compare  ergonom-
ically.  For same reason, small-paged manuals don't either.  And, at any  time 
you  wish to study (read 7-times per Z-News 302, page 3), you have  carry-away 
book to take to your easy-chair.  For efficient study, little books are  three 
feet  short of a yard, significantly lacking.  When, Oh! When do we think  for 
ourselves, think as individuals, stop trooping, and become spheres (planets).
     "The  imagination  is  the power of the mind over  the  possibilities  of 
things."--Wallace  Stevens.   But are not thoughts things?  If not,  what  are 
thoughts?   Seems we cross into another dimension when comparing thoughts  and 
things,  do we not?  Literal versus abstract; vertical,  horizontal;  surface, 
and  beneath;  contrasts,  perspectives, illusions, and how  we  react  to  an 
unexpected event scientifically predict what we are.  To be or not to be!  Can 
we wish other?  But, which do we choose?
     ====================================================================
Of  Cabbages  and Kings.   Though having many  clerical  advantages,  "expert" 
systems using Artificial Intelligence techniques represent risks that  potent-
ially  reduce possibilities, reduce diversity.  Do these systems  promote  our 
thinking, do they allow us to learn more efficiently, or do they make us  more 
dependent  on  the thinking of others?  Think!  Here society is  at  a  brink, 
ready  to use another tool; but will we use it wisely?  History says  we  will 
not.   Look  at  what spreadsheets have done to  progressive  thinking.   Wall 
Street money changers are out in force.
     Recent  actions  of  US government, invasion of Granada  and  bombing  of 
Libya, no matter what the reason, make our hearts burn.  Troubles in  Bolivia, 
El  Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, etc., are result of general disrespect  for 
people  and their life, past inaction, slothfulness of ambassadors  and  their 
aides, and lack of wisdom at our grass roots.  Solution is simple: we  suggest 
getting on the side of angels and eagles--support the country's peasants,  the 
depressed, those desiring freedom, those looking for possibilities.  Would not 
this totally take wind out of sails of Communist, Marxist?  We seem to support 
those who hold only material power and not moral power--moral power,  foundat-
ion  of our nation's earlier successes.  What does Lady Liberty say about  our 
present  lack  of support for people seeking deliverance  from  bondage,  from 
arbitrary  and despotic government?  Government, those in power, wherein  each 
bureaucrat  has  a vested interest in maintaining the status quo,  in  general 
lacks  sufficient  soul.  We manage our foreign policy the way we  manage  our 
industries, too often taking narrow and short views, seldom seeing.
