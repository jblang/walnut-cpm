                          ZCPR3 Newsletter 001


Thanks for joining in our support for CP/M-80 systems.  As we present
this premier issue of the Newsletter, we look forward with a positive
and confident feeling that our new software fills an important niche in
your world.  The microcomputer industry was started, nurtured, made
viable, by 8-bit machines and Echelon doesn't intend to abandon them,
as many have been so quick to do!  We believe 8-bit machines are most
practical and cost effective for jobs you desire to perform.

You will find ZCPR3 provides a powerful set of tools to manage both your
present and future computing tasks.  Furthermore, the overall software
system represented by ZCPR3 is expanding with new application packages
to solve new business and personal problems, to integrate existing
programs in your library using concise and crisp menus, and to handle
day-to-day computer disk file maintenance.

WordStar (or WordMaster), SuperCalc, and dBase II are ideal candidates to
run from one menu under ZCPR3, because of their similar command structures.
TERM III and DISCAT work nicely with these, too.  The upgraded VFILER and
new VMENU utilities with ZEX batch processing will supply modern screen-
oriented, user-convenient control of all work normally performed by your
computer.  (VFILER and VMENU are contained in ZCPR3, Phase 2, out in a few
months.)  You quickly learn to write your custom menus from text material
supplied with ZCPR3 source and documentation files.

Echelon plans to operate a ZCPR3-related computer bulletin board.  But until
that time arrives, the 300/1200 bps AMPRO Computers, Inc. BBS (run by
Jerry Haigwood) may be used to carry ZCPR3 news items.  Your questions or
statements can be handled by Jerry's board.  The number is: 408/258-8128.
Questions we can't answer are referred to either Rick Conn or Joe Wright.

Joe is nearing completion of a universal auto-installing version of ZCPR3.
After beta testing, this version of ZCPR will be offered to those who believe
they can't install ZCPR3 by MOVING their system down, modifying their BIOS,
and using DDT to overlay the original code.  The price is expected to be
$149.00.  Both Alpha Systems Corporation and Echelon will offer the program
to the public.  More on its features as the program matures.

We enjoy hearing from you, about ideas you have relative to your experience
with ZCPR3, thoughts about features you'd like Rick to add, gripes and the
reverse -- let's hear from you.
