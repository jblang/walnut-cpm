Z TIPS.   Let's talk about shells, command history shells.  Michael Rubenstein 
(Galveston,  TX) updates his HSH with Version 1.3.  As far as we can see,  the 
program is perfect for RAM disk based systems, near perfect for fast hard disk 
systems, but not so good for slow floppies.  Program is written in C/80  using 
special  run-time  library.   Wonder what it would take to  write  program  in 
assembler.
     What is HSH?  It's a ZCPR3 shell that permits full command-line  editing, 
using  WordStar  commands, and has ability to recall up to last  100  commands 
entered.   Such  power  aids in re-running commands over  and  over,  even  if 
changes  are  needed  each time command is run,  greatly  reducing  keystrokes 
needed to control computer operations.  
     You  get  started by typing HSH<cr> or HSH 50<cr>.  Latter  declares  how 
many commands VAR file, file where previous commands are automatically stored, 
allows  before wrap-around occurs.  If first is entered, last  declaration  is 
used, or 10 is default if none ever declared.  Default seems best, as contents 
of VAR file is retained from cold-boot to cold-boot.  ^E goes to last  command 
executed,  that  command may have been a long alias.  As  you  recall  command 
after command, ^X is used to get back to current, last.  Character changes are 
made  easily.   ^S  and  ^D move cursor left and  right  along  command  line, 
character  by character; ^Q and ^R, by command in multi-command line;  and  ^A 
and  ^F,  word  by word within a command.  ^J brings to  screen  a  matrix  of 
editing  commands  available.   Find  text-string  is  also  provided.   <esc> 
instantly exits HSH, if entered as first character at command-line prompt.   A 
short  online help file provides sufficient documentation.  Michael thinks  of 
everything.
     Next subject.  XDIR is useful sending directory listings to your printer.
Entering  command XDIR /up<cr> sends all files in all user areas, for  archive 
record.   After you have your disk system organized you print directories  for 
permanent  record, to quickly re-create if necessary.  Z-News 007 covers  some 
aspects  of versatile XDIR.  ZCPR3: The Manual has over 4 pages, 107  to  111, 
describing  how to use all its capability.  Furthermore, directories  declared 
PUBLIC  show  when accessing with XDIR, as with DIR, Version  1.2.   Directory 
comparing, sending directory to a file, are XDIR features worth exploring.

PRODUCT  REVIEW.    Eight-bit, now-generation document  spelling  checker  and 
correction  program  is  V-SPELL, with initial  60-thousand  word  dictionary. 
Using  best techniques of The Word Plus (TWP), CompuView (1955 Pauline  Blvd., 
Ann Arbor, MI 48103, phone 313/996-1299) integrated functions for  convenience 
and  quickest.  Top level of screen-oriented multi-menu offers CHECK,  REVISE, 
DICTIONARY, SETTINGS, EXIT, and HELP command options.
     CHECK  creates  file  of  words  not  found  in  dictionaries,  main   or 
supplemental.
     During correction in REVISE mode, many lines, default is 10, show unfound 
(no-match  in dictionaries) word in context.  (We changed our context  default 
to  5 lines, for maximum speed.)  Options in REVISE are CORRECT, LOOKUP,  ADD, 
IGNORE,  MARK, RETURN, and HELP.  LOOKUP shows 12 words with similar  spelling 
to  one un-matched.  A word may be typed-in while in LOOKUP to see if it's  in 
dictionary.   Unfound words are markable with "%%" to make finding them  quick 
and  easy;  also,  lines  are numbered if you need to know  where  to  go  for 
paragraph  re-form.  Most defaults are changed quickly with SETTINGS  command.
RETURN brings you back to main (top) menu, EXIT to OS.
     Ergonomics of menus permit either single letter commands (first letter of 
command  name)  or cursor movement to command name followed by <cr>.   TWP  is 
about  as quick but its main menu screen certainly is not as pretty,  uses  no 
highlighting.
     DICTIONARY  functions include LOOKUP, COMPRESS, HYPHENATION, RETURN,  and 
HELP.  Hyphenation function creates a duplicate file, of the one under  check-
and-correct, with hyphens placed in words known to the dictionary.   Compress, 
merge  one  dictionary with another--super feature!  One thing we  longed  for 
with  TWP  was  dictionary merging  capability.   Without,  draw-back:  update 
dictionary is not searched when looking up words.  Your custom words are  used 
only  to compare for match from one or more dictionaries; that's not bad,  but 
could be better with merging-dictionary feature, as with V-SPELL.
     SETTINGS  command  permit changing, temporarily or  permanently,  default 
options from within program.  Nice!
     Overall subjective comparison between V-SPELL and TWP give the former  an 
edge in speed, dictionary thoroughness, and crispness of user interface.
     Next  generation  spelling checker should be within  word  processor,  so 
errors are optionally detected as they are made!  With soon-to-come banked  Z-
System,  and multitasking, we trust someone comes up with such a  combination, 
as  well  as  with  an integrated  thesaurus.   We  certainly  encourage  such 
happening.

More  on Newword.   Last fortnight we simply had too much news  to  completely 
cover  all the improvements that Newword, Version 2.17, offers over  WordStar, 
Version 3.0.
     Printer control is near absolute with the use of dot commands that permit 
sending  any control or sequence codes to handle font type, character  height, 
and  other functions to format printed page.  Even a null (^@, 00 hex) can  be 
sent.   Form  is:  .xq nn nn nn nn, where .x is the dot lead-in,  q  is  print 
command  (remaining  5  user-functions  w, e, r, [,  and  ]  may  be  declared 
simultaneously), nn is any hex value.
     After  declaring  dot value in file, use ^PQ to activate.   Dot  commands 
temporarily override default, built-in printer user functions.


"Sketch from Alice in Wonderland" with quote "Yes, my Queen, I have found IT."


     After an .LH dot command is used for line height declaration, page  break 
displays correctly no matter where LH statements are placed in document.  Such 
feature  makes  for  easy  inclusion of several  line  spacings  in  the  same 
document, and even on the same page.  Watch for our 6, 7, and 8 lines per inch 
on same page 4 below, with no change in header or footer spacing.
     One  thing  lacking  is  ability  to  right-margin  justify  when   using 
proportionally  spaced  font;  but, microjustification routine  used  is  best 
possible  for fixed-width characters.  (PropStar, see Z-News 304 for  details, 
handles proportional printing tasks for us.)
     Recall-filename,  using  ^R  at N, D, or P command,  has  cursor  editing 
facility,  ^D for forward, ^S for backward, and ^G to delete  character  under 
cursor.   A character within name can be changed without changing whole  name.
And there's a type-ahead buffer, so disk access and fast screen scans work  as 
they  should--no  WAIT appears on status line as you quickly  scan,  with  as-
necessary disk-accesses occurring.
     String  find  and replace (^QF and ^QA) functions permit use  of  "?"  to 
match  any character, CP/M filename style, superior to the ^A required by  WS.
And ^U, in addition to unerasing a deleted word, line, or block, stops  safely 
any  command in progress, without any other keystrokes required to  return  to 
normal editing.
     For  high-level-language programmers, auto-indent after tab for  C,  PAS, 
and  PLI  file types is provided in non-document  mode.   Easy-to-patch  space 
exists  for up to 5 more special tab/indent situations.  (As we use  NW,  more 
features show up.)
     There's  a utility to strip your printer drivers from massive (over  42k-
byte)  OVR file to save disk space--nice touch.  Diablo driver we use is  only 
6k-bytes long.
     For us, icing-on-cake is ability to freely log into any drive, user  area 
(like  we  do  with  VFILER) and edit files there,  without  leaving  NW  word 
processor.  Z-System directories really come-alive for text editing tasks.
     Instructional material, typeset and bound, provides information in  three 
sections:   1)  Do  It Yourself--A Tutorial, 2)  Nuts  &  Bolts--Customization 
Guide, and 3) Encyclopedia--Reference Manual.  Complete information on how  to 
patch  and poke (Get-Poke-Go style, see Z-News 107 and 109) functions is  also 
provided.   Every software package should have such complete and well  written 
documentation.
     Newword  need not be placed in a public directory area.  Since  it  knows 
how to find its OVR files it's not necessary, a conflict could exist:  similar 
user-area file mask technique used as PUBLIC ZRDOS Plus.  NW is used from  any 
directory  simply  by placing all its files in A0:, or any other  drive,  user 
area declared during initial program installation.
     At  $125.00, we feel NW a super bargain--Lasting-Value  Software  exists, 
has meaning--order from Newstar Software, Inc., 1601 Oak Park Blvd.,  Pleasant 
Hill, CA 94523, 415/932-2278.  Tell them you read about Newword in EI Z-News.  

Graphics  and Windows.   WOW!  Look at 'em...new 8-bit world!  A first as  far 
as we know--REL libraries GRXLIB, GRWLIB, and PDMLIB (Item 28 from Price List) 
permit doing just about anything you wish, producing attractive, modern  (non-
TTY) screen menus and displays.  Notice pull down menu and bar charts enclosed 
in  box  in left photo, and three overlapping windows overlaying  main  screen 
text in right.  Reproduction doesn't do justice to original screens.
     Highlighted  "SETPDM Routine" is sample command.  Moving cursor down  one 
or  two  permits, by pressing <cr>, executing desired one.   At  right,  three 
windows  are  opened,  one after the other overlapping.  Active  one  is  last 
opened, first to be closed.  These examples, and more, are in file GRDEMO.LBR, 
found on Z-Nodes everywhere.


                   "Photos of screen graphics and windows."


     Caveats:   (1)  Windows are only memory-efficient if a terminal  is  used 
that returns character under cursor, in addition to having cursor  addressing. 
(2)  Some terminals may not be able to use windows--we study where our  common 
denominator should be when applying them to utility and application  programs. 
And, (3) Terminals without graphic characters built-in will use standard ASCII 
symbols  instead.  We're in transition.  Stay with us as we discover best  way 
to handle features of newer terminals, but still allow use of older ones.

Amateur Z User's Corner.  Multiple commands per line, i.e., automatic  command 
chaining,  is  a major feature of Z-System.  Combined with ability  to  easily 
create  aliases (alias:  multiple commands known, executed by  single  one-to-
eight character name) makes for power at the toolset, operating system  level.
Parameter  passing--trailing names typed after command name in command  line--
adds more power.  Placing $d:, $u:, or $d$u in alias declares current disk and 
user area; if a command, declaration immediately followed by semicolon,  e.g., 
<cmd>;$d$u:;<cmd>, current DU: becomes default DU:.
     First alias normally created, optimized is STARTUP (Z3-Dot-Com and  Z-Com 
users,  it's called STRT), the one used during cold-boot and  reset.   Typical 
starting alias we use here at EI:

  LDR SYS.ENV,SYS.RCP,SYS.FCP,SYS.NDR,MYTERM.Z3T;PATH A15 A0;  <<
      PUBLIC /DA,U6;HSH;VERROR;B0:;VFILER

The "<<" mark indicates line wrap; line is continuous in actual macro.
     Interactive  program development is easy using tools of Z.   For  budding 
hackers,  here's a VFILER CMD user-function (#) macro command line that  makes 
going  from  program under development to editor easy, quick,  and  efficient. 
Notice return to editor (Newword in this case, poke addresses set non-document 
mode and reverse normal document mode screen highlighting) if errors occur  in 
assembly.   If  no errors, program is simply run automatically  as  executable 
file:  %n,  expands to file name.  Changes continue (point at file  and  press 
numeral  representing  macro  command line, 8 in our example)  until  you  are 
satisfied with results.

8 %d%u:;zas %n;if er;sak /p3 errors--link cancelled;get 100 nw.com;
  poke 74e ff;poke 787 ff;go %f;else;zlink %d:%n,a:vlib/,a:z3lib/,
  a:syslib/;era %n.rel;%n;fi

Long macros (aliases, too) push limits of normal command-line buffer  lengths. 
Remember  expanded  line  is what goes into buffer,  e.g.,  %n  above  becomes 
filename  of  program to assemble and link.  Filetype (%t), not used  in  this 
case, would be Z80.
     More macros!  Starting point for word processing CMD menu might look like 
this:

Z-Node  Activity.    To be current with Z-System special  utilities  you  need 
VERROR,  Version 1.6 or later; BALAIS, Version 1.3; ARUNZ, Version  0.8;  HSH, 
Version  1.3; and VCED, Version 1.3.  On Z-Nodes everywhere,  these  programs, 
produced  by  Z-System  users,  and  what  a  community,  provide  significant 
enhancements to normal Z-System operations.
     We  have  many  customers not yet online.  Our node system  is  the  only 
economical  method to get file-updates to everyone.  The rate and quantity  of 
changes  make it impossible for a company of our resources to do it any  other 
way.   Our Z-Nodes are important channels, linking Z-Community.  We  encourage 
everyone to have a modem, have modem software, and be online.  It's 1986!
     ZWORD.TXT,  document  written by Richard Conn, addresses four  (4)  often 
asked questions about Z-System.  1) Is ZCPR3 hard to bring up on my  computer?
2)  How much memory does Z-System take?  3) Do I have to have a hard  disk  to 
run Z-System?  And, 4) How can I find out more about Z-System?  If  interested 
in answers, download file from a Z-Node and print formatted using WordStar  or 
Newword, else use ZCPR3 PRINT for unformatted text printing.

From  Our Mail Box.   Ellwood Douglas (Orinda, CA), "I've been  in  electrical 
engineering  and computers for 30 years, and I have never brought up  so  much 
code  with  so few bugs in it.  My complements and gratitude to  everyone  who 
took  part in this."  Richard Conn is responsible for monument  called  ZCPR3, 
Dennis Wright for ZRDOS, and Patrick O'Connell for ZAS and ZLINK.
     Marc Rubin (Long Beach, CA) writes, "Avoid hinting at the things that can 
be  accomplished.   Give  detailed  specific,  explicit,  lengthy,   redundant 
examples.  You will find it boring, we who wish to use the Z-System will not."
Marc,  from where you are coming from, and from where we are coming  from,  we 
each do what we can.  What other (software) company products a newsletter that 
comes  out  every  fortnight?  Our audience is extremely  diverse--we  try  to 
satisfy all at once.
     "Stop!   Don't  replace your S-100 system yet.  Mainly because  there  is 
nothing in the market that can measure up to your S-100 in versatility, power,

Potpourri.    We  hear through the grapevine (we work in California,  lots  of 
vines,  real wine country) of new HD64180 single-board computer with  big  and 
fast  RAM,  said to transfer over a megabyte per second.  That's  much  faster 
than any micro we know of.  After permission is obtained to tell, we think you 
will find this 4.5" by 8.0" SBC machine interesting, unique, as we do.
     Magnum  Digital porting their S-100 boards to work with Z-System (see  Z-
News 306/308).  New dual-purpose floppy/hard disk controller board is the  one 
getting the port.  CPU and extended memory boards mate with controller board--
what a combo!
     Thanks for being patient during our facility and phone-system expansions.
Changes  recently made should make for better customer and  potential-customer 
service,  the kind we truly wish to provide but lately haven't been  able  to.
We  now,  finally,  are positioned to handle expected  growth  in  an  orderly 
manner.  Whopee!
     We  thank  John Tenniel and his memory (psychic emanation)  for  drawings 
depicting Alice and her kingdom.  His sketches are used appreciating spirit in 
which  they were originally drawn.  And, hopefully, we assist continuation  of 
vital Lewis Carroll tradition.
     Response  to Z-News 307 offering WONDER: Lesson Learning for $100.00  has
