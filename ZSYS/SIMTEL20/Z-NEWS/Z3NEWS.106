Z TIPS:  VMENU, a powerful shell under Z, has features somewhat different, and 
perhaps  at times more useful,  than MENU.    Significant differences  between 
these  two and another Z shell,  VFILER,  indicate blending all three as  most 
useful:

         Feature                           VMENU      MENU     VFILER
         1. Show directory of files
            along with menu                  yes        no        yes
         2. Optionally lock user into
            menu system                      yes       yes         no
         3. Show macro commands to
            be executed                       no       yes         no
         4. Use macro commands from single
            keystrokes shown on menu         yes       yes        yes
         5. Programmer speed mode
            (no menu shown)                   no       yes        yes
         6. Operate on file currently
            pointed to                       yes        no        yes
         7. Either page-out or scroll
            menus                             no       yes         no
         8. User-generated menu syntax
            checker for quick debugging      yes       yes         no
         9. General disk system house-
            keeping                         good      fair       best

An argument for universal use can be made for these Z shells.   Your directory 
system could contain each,  in turn, depending upon dominant task for a parti-
cular  directory  environment.   Environment  is created by  ST  (alias-script 
containing  segments and commands) being loaded automatically by CD,  used  to 
exit previous environment and arrive at present.
     A  fully secure system (one requiring password access to directories  and 
protected  ERA,  REN,  etc.  utilities) could use MENU as main  user-interface 
driver;  other two,  VMENU and VFILER,  used to speed general computer activi-
ties:  word processing, spread-sheet, telecommunications, database management, 
accounting, programming--you name it.  Secure systems are ideal in office (and 
home  child-occupied)  areas  where  many people  have  access  to  unattended 
machines.
     Some Z users have not realized that Richard Conn has greatly extended our 
library  functions by adding Vlib and Z3lib to complement  Syslib3.   Six-disk 
package, with full source code for each subroutine, sells for only $45.00: our 
free-will donation to structured Assembly Language advancements.   Package  is 
Item 27 on EI new price sheet effective 28 February.  Syslib3 (Item 26) alone, 
still only $29.00 on 4 disks!

Z-Tools (tm) Featured:   Zas, Z80 macro relocating assembler with Zlink, Zlib, 
Zcon,  and Zref,  does it all.  Well, not all but nearly!  Center-piece of our 
tool  collection,  Zas  forms  basis  for  structured,  maintainable  Assembly 
Language  program  generation.  Use  Syslib3,  Vlib and Z3lib  as  source  for 
hundreds of linkable,  efficient and proven subroutines.   We combined popular 
features to make Assembly Language program writing easier.   A macro expanding 
assembler using Intel,  Zilog,  DRI, TDL, and Microsoft syntax, mnemonics, and 
pseudo-ops  creating  at  command-line option either Digital Research  HEX  or 
Microsoft REL object code.   HEX files are converted to executable files  with 
Mload or with DRI Load;  REL files are linked with modular library subroutines 
and loaded with Echelon Zlink,  DRI Link or Microsoft L80 (Link-80).  Standard 
DRI  sorted symbol table is optionally produced for use by EI DSD and DRI  SID 
and  ZSID debuggers.   Zas works faster than conventional assemblers,  as does 
Zlink.
     Zas  comes  with a librarian,  Zlib,  to build and  manage  linkable  REL 
libraries,  and  Zcon.   The latter converts extended Intel (TDL) mnemonics to 
Zilog.   Symbol and label table cross referenced,  with statistics,  to source 
line npseudo-ops are also 
correctly converted, translated.  (Zas is Item 10 on our price sheet:  $95.00, 
complete.)
     We  can now all convert our 8080 coded programs to Z80 and assemble  them 
with Zas!   Bravo!   Patrick O'Connell, our faith in you has been fully justi-
fied!   (Being not a perfect world,  we're sure minor changes to some programs 
will be required because of syntax inequalities.  So be it!)
     DSD,  Dynamic Screen Debugger,  provides features previously not seen  on 
microcomputers.   Version we ship works with both extended Intel (set produced 
using  DRI Z80.LIB and MAC,  essentially TDL) and Zilog mnemonics.   DSD  uses 
ZCPR3 environmental descriptor for automatic program installation,  as other Z 
utilities  are  installed with Z3INS and your SYS.ENV (or Z3.ENV if using  Z3-
Dot-Com) file.
     DSD  Software In-Circuit-Emulator provides many expensive hardware  I.C.E 
features but it doesn't require attaching any wires.   Single step and  break-
point in ROM, write protect RAM, set code execute only, protect the stack from 
overflowing,  catch  illegal  instructions and watch memory locations and  cpu 
registers.   The  emulator can breakpoint on arbitrary conditions or  identify 
when  a  LDIR instruction is going to write over  protected  locations  before 
writing occurs!  Not even hardware I.C.E. can provide such capability.
     Full  support provided for symbol files as generated by Zas,  Mac,  Rmac, 
M80  (Macro-80),  and other popular language  translators--complete  symbolic, 
full-screen  editor  debugging!   DSD  runs on  8080,  8085,  NSC800  and  Z80 
computers--soon  will  take  full  advantage of  Hitachi  HD64180,  and  when-
available Zilog Z800, super 8-bit microprocessors.
     Other DSD features include:   in-context online help,  save memory into a 
file, single step over subroutines, string searching, port I/O, viewing files. 
And it only takes 16k-bytes of memory!   (You C-Language programmers eat-your-
hearts-out.)   It's Item 25 on our current price list.
     By the way,  each EI software line Item retains its number as price lists 
are updated, acting as excellent double-check when orders are received.  If we 
need numbers for more than 99 items,  heaven forbid, we'll use over-100 number 
categories.

FLASH!  Richard Conn featured as speaker at upcoming Trenton, NJ Faire, 20-217 
April!   Rick speaks on software development system environments:   ZCPR3 (Z), 
Unix and Ada.

New  Computer  Magazine Appearing:  Sol Libes  produces  an  every-other-month 
magazine called Micro/Systems Journal,  first issue is dated March/April 1985! 
Dave   Hardy   has joined him but continues his column with Micro  Cornucopia. 
Randy  Reitz  has written a review of ZCPR3 features and we should see  it  in 
Sol's May/June issue.   (Mail M/SJ subscription orders to Box 1192,  Mountain-
side,  NJ  07092;  $18.00 per year, six issues; $32.00 for two years.)  Wonder 
where  Chris Terry,  erstwhile writer,  as are above,  of  defunct  Ziff-David 
Microsystems magazine, will show up next.


About  EI Manuals:  Echelon documentation is intended to be placed in  3-ring, 
loose-leaf binders (ZCPR3:  The Manual is exception).  We don't already supply 
such holders because of shipping weight and bulk.  Good quality binders are so 
dense,  postage  would exceed their down-at-your-local-stationery-store price. 
On  the other hand,  many have asked us to produce a special binder  with  "Z" 
printed  on its front along with program- and tool-name page dividers--we  may 
do  this,  if  we  can  get a wholesale deal that's  attractive  to  you,  our 
customers.
     Standard size, 8 1/2" by 11", loose-leaf folders are most efficient, best 
for reading,  studying,  learning from.   IBM-standard (5 1/2" by 8 1/2")  are 
simply  too small (a backward way to do things);  and holders of these  little 
folders  make access from desk-top a two-handed procedure.   Only one hand  is 
needed with conventional,  large,  without-being-in-a-box, loose-leaf binders. 
But,  Oh!  how  the herd has gotten into line:   each one following the other, 
waiting for a turn to sip nourishment from a much-used trough.

Z-News  Numbering  System  consists of  trailing  three  digits;  first  digit 
representing  Volume number and last,  the Issue.   Middle digit is inert  and 
used  only  because  file  is sent "squeezed" to various  message  systems  in 
middle-digit-always-Q  form.   So  this Z-News 106 (1Q6) is  Volume  1,  Issue 
Number 6.  (We started with Volume 0; zero is a useful number sometimes, isn't 
it?)  Each Volume consists of nine (9) Issues,  decimal modulo before cycle is 
repeated, except there's never an Issue 0.  We felt no necessity to key issues 
to earthly months since it's published fortnightly.   When we've published  90 
issues,  we'll change the numbering system (we may go to hexidecimal--no, just 
kidding).   Some  of  you asked about numbering;  you now have our  considered 
answer.

An  ancient  once  said,  "A picture is worth a thousand  words."   Icons  are 
special pictures,  two-dimensional symbols,  presently in vogue.  Icons permit 
humans and computers to communicate.  Long, long time ago, we used hieroglyphs 
and  then  cuneiform to communicate among ourselves,  we early  homo  sapiens. 
Then  after  struggle,  an alphabet developed.   Now we go back  to  pictures, 
icons.   How many glyphs can we remember;  50,  100,  5,000!  Echelon predicts 
English  words  and phrases will be found best interface  between  humans  and 
machines.  We recognize symbols as powerful, but we still must learn what each 
symbol  stands  for!   Icons presently are produced  using  common,  every-day 
symbols easily associated with common computer functions.   But day draws near 
when  the number of functions gets so large,  new non-everyday symbols have to 
be  created--a whole new language learning would then be  necessary--which  is 
something we don't think appropriate!   It's up to us to generate phrases that 
permit  quick learning,  association with that known,  to what is  momentarily 
desired.
     Computing  machines using icons,  Star,  Lisa,  Macintosh (name of a rain 
coat,  not a variety of apple, providing insight to mentality of founders of a 
certain company) are so easy to learn--pray tell,  but what have you  learned? 
Such  machines are fading even now.   Touch screens,  dead (sorry  HP);  mouse 
pointers (and track balls,  joy sticks, digitizing pads) have a place if heavy 
graphics are necessary;  high-resolution light pens (painter's brush) could be 
next  big  fade.   No  universal solution to  user/machine  communications  is 
possible;  each of us have our needs of the moment.   Remember,  we can't even 
reliably talk to opposite gender (sex), how our computing machines!
     Four-year  programmers wish only command-line completion  features;  one-
week interested users,  Macintosh's;  two months,  IBM PC's; ten year, protect 
your you-know-what big-company managers, IBM PC, XT and AT's.  As we see more, 
as  we learn more,  our needs move from plateau to plateau.   "There's no free 
lunch!"   It's only through work (intentional  doing,  conscious  thought--not 
mindless, repetitive action) that our being is altered to see, to know more of 
what's going on.   Get knowledge, get a friend or two (compadres, we call them 
here  on the west coast),  get money (and power over others);  but whatever is 
done, get understanding, get wisdom!
     Appreciate,  accept, our Universe is about releasing energy from matter--
you  are  its  center (did you think it was about matter  being  created  from 
energy, you silly savage).  Let no one push you aside!  Ask questions--answers 
are  not too important,  asking questions is!   From your questioning  develop 
your own answers; become a sphere of power--a sphere of action, not reaction!

See you down the lines...
