Z  TIPS:  From ZRDOS author,  Dennis Wright (Joseph Wright wrote ZRDINS  semi-
auto installation program): "Several apparent problems and questions regarding 
ZRDOS Version 1.0 have come up.  I hope the following information will help to 
clarify these questions.
     "It has been found that at least one system (CCS 300, 400) uses part (the 
last  16  bytes)  of  the BDOS image area in the SYSGEN image  for  cold  boot 
configuration  information.   Installation of ZRDOS overlays this  area.   The 
solution  is to first install ZRDOS into the sysgen image and  then  reinstall 
the BIOS hex file.   This will cause no problem for ZRDOS as the last 48 bytes 
of  the  image is stack area.   The CCS system uses the information  contained 
there to configure the system during cold boot. Once the cold boot occurs this 
information is no longer needed and will be overlaid by ZRDOS.
     "The  ZRDOS  installation instructions contain an  example  SYSGEN  image 
installation  based on a standard CP/M SYSGEN image (ORG 980H).   Some systems 
use  a  different image base address.   So be sure to  calculate  the  correct 
offset when installing the ZRDOS.BIN file.
     "ZRDOS  is  the replacement for a standard CP/M 2.2  BDOS.   Non-standard 
BDOS implementations are not [and cannot be] supported.
     "Some  public  domain utilities have been found to  function  incorrectly 
under  ZRDOS.   In all cases reported so far the utilities were  using  undoc-
umented  internal features of CP/M 2.2 BDOS.   ZRDOS supports only the Digital 
Research documented features.   The utilities reported so far are  ARCHIVE.COM 
by  Kelly  Smith which requires a patch to BDOS,  and SDIR.COM which  modifies 
BDOS  error  vectors.   ARCHIVE  is not needed  under  ZRDOS;  AC.COM  [called 
COPY.COM in the early issues] does the same job.   SDIR should be modified  to 
use  the  ZRDOS set and reset cold boot trap functions (Functions 50  and  52) 
that  are  provided  to  handle these needs.   [Joseph  Wright  updated  Super 
Directory  (SD97):   it  works  with  ZRDOS;  it's  been  distributed  to  BBS 
network.]"
     Jay  Sage (Newton Centre,  Massachusetts) has corrected ERROR1/2  to  run 
under  ZEX command-failure conditions.   He also made the single-command error 
display more meaningful.  At same time he worked over DU3.  His updates are in 
file Z3SAGE.LBR.  This file plus ZRDOS HLP and six utility files are presently 
on  our  Z-Nodes.    (ZRDOS  utilities  only  run  if  you're  using   ZRDOS.) 
Incidentally,  Jay is becoming, along with Al Hawley, full Z-Node.  You Boston 
locals  try  Jay's  system  at 617/965-7259;  Los Angeles folks  try  Al's  at 
213/670-9465.   (Many  more Sysops are signing up to  become  Z-Nodes.   Their 
access numbers will be given as the relationships firm.)

While Zilog moves slowly to production with advanced Z800 8-bit chip,  Hitachi 
America  (2210 O'Toole Avenue,  San Jose,  CA 95131,  telephone  408/942-1500) 
announces  volume March 1985 shipments of their new HD64180 (sampled last year 
as  piece-part HD62801).  We are investigating its instruction set  and  other 
features:   512k-byte RAM control, dual UART, CTC, and DMA controller, plus 8-
bit multiply and block memory move,  on chip.  Additionally, a two-way clocked 
high  speed  serial  port (CSI/O) provided makes for  interesting  Local  Area 
Networking (LAN) possibilities, direct 400k-baud communications at 8 mHz clock 
rate.  (We presently finish our Z port to it, should be complete when you read 
this newsletter!)
     Specifications point to not one,  but two super 8-bitters being available 
to  run Z-based software!   (Though these newer chips run 8080/Z80 instruction 
sets,  and even more,  neither is physically pin-for-pin compatible with older 
chips--you  can't simply unplug one and replace with other.   Printed  circuit 
board redesign is necessary.)
     Hitachi's HD64180 is 80186 of eight-bit world, as Z800 is the 80286 (chip 
used by IBM AT).   Tony Moroyan (Strategic Marketing Manager,  Hitachi)  said, 
"Many  would  prefer  better performance in eight-bit,  and  compatibility  to 
present software."  His colleague, Sarv Thakur (Microprocessor Group Marketing 
Manager),  indicated  present high 8-bit demand by stating,  "We  expect  this 
market to remain for many years to come."  Remember,  Echelon is here now with 
advanced  Z  Operating  System (ZCPR3 combined with ZRDOS3) ready  to  support 
high-technology microprocessor architecture.
     These  new  high-integration  chips are superior in many  ways  to  their 
16/32-bit counterparts,  and can be used without sacrificing incredibly  large 
base  of  existing  8080/Z80 software and  programming  know-how!   The  Z800, 
because of high clock rate capability and superior design,  should run circles 
around Intel 80286.  This not withstanding, Hitachi's chip sets_a_standard for 
cost  effective,  high  performance computer designs.    Here are bench  marks 
running BYTE Magazine "Sieve" under MBasic (HD64180 clock at 6.144 mHz and one 
wait state; other computers, as delivered):

                          Apple IIe -- 2806 seconds    (6502)
                          TRS-80/II -- 2250    "        (Z80)
                             IBM PC -- 1950    "       (8088)
               Unannounced Computer -- 1322    "    (HD64180)
                    Apple Macintosh -- 1214    "      (68010)

     Over  twice as fast as Apple II,  nearly as fast as Macintosh  (32-bit?), 
and much faster than IBM PC (16-bit?)!   The production HD64180 units are said 
to run at 10 mHz clock speed increasing above performance by more than 50%  to 
806  seconds,  leaving Macintosh in road dust!   Just guessing,  IBM AT likely 
does  Sieve  in  600  or so seconds.   We understand  Hitachi  is  offering  a 
companion,  high thru-put graphics processor:   2 mega-pixels per second, both 
for full-color and monochrome.  Now that's more than state-of-the-art (NEC eat 
your heart out)!   S-100 and single-board computer manufacturers, which of you 
are first with a board using one of these great new chips?
     Eight-bit microprocessors continue to be designed into new  systems,  and 
in  accelerating amounts,  with little notice from popular press.   We predict 
such systems will be around as long as they serve well so many  applications--
they  provide unusually high overall performance because it's so easy to  stay 
with  Assembly Language,  instead of having to move to inefficient  high-level 
languages.  (Something is never received for nothing...learn a little each day 
and  reduce  a little anxiety and frustration.)  Using Richard Conn's  Syslib3 
for  standard subroutine functions makes program writing efficient  and  fast, 
both in-doing and in-results.
     It's  now  so clear that IBM's selection of pseudo 16-bit Intel 8088  for 
their PC has distorted normal development progress of microcomputers.   What a 
waste!   We also sense a small backlash from deception and lack  of  editorial 
leadership  of popular press.   Who likes to feel duped!   But who takes blame 
for  poor  leadership?   Leader or followers?   Let us (and  them)  know  your 
feelings.   What  you do is infinitesimal,  but it's infinitely important that 
you do it!

Z-Tools are shipping!    Some highlights of Z80 ZDM/ZDMZ  debuggers:   twenty-
one  (21) commands versus DDT's 12.   One of these commands (B) permit  string 
searches  (in both hex and ASCII) over a specific memory block range.   Others 
enable  monitor  and complete  debugger,  patcher  operations.   Command  line 
prompts ease operator mental overhead.
     ZDM  P  (print) command is toggle expecting no trailing  arguments.   The 
effect is to send all output to printer as well as to console.   It is  turned 
off  by  a  subsequent P command.   Whenever P toggle is on,  a  'P'  will  be 
displayed  as  part  of X (examine and alter current cpu state) or  T  (trace) 
display.   Jump (J) command is also toggle without arguments.  It only affects 
subsequent T or U (untrace) commands.   If J has been executed then T  command 
displays only conditional and unconditional CALLS,  JUMPS,  RETURNS, RESTARTS, 
PCHL  (IX  or IY) and relative JUMPS.   The Tn form of trace is  usually  used 
where n represents actual number of instructions to be traced.  Whenever the J 
toggle is on,  a 'J' will be displayed as part of the X or T display.   QI and 
QO  permit input and output of byte value to selected I/O port while DI and EI 
permit interrupt disable and enable.
     Any ZDM command may be cancelled by pressing the rubout (DEL) key.  Works 
with  both extended Intel and Zilog mnemonics.   ZDM,  a super-value tool  for 
$50.00 plus S&H.
     REVAS3:   superb  documentation  is monument  to  understanding  Assembly 
Language  and disassembly of object code to source listing.   Enough here  for 
everyone to learn something from,  enough for you advanced hackers and program 
designers.   Major  features include interactively assisting you analyze  your 
software  for  modification,   disassembling  files  as  large  as  64k-bytes, 
assigning real labels to subroutines, inserting comments to disassembled code, 
and generation of cross reference listings.   A tool of great prize at  $90.00 
plus S&H!
     ITOZ-ZTOI-TTOI-ITOT:  these four (4) Zilog/Intel/TDL (Xitan) mnemonic and 
pseudo-op  code  translators make source code conversions so easy compared  to 
hand  translating with a text or program editor--night versus  day.   A  tool-
value similar to ones above:  $51.00 plus normal S&H.
     (Z-News  next  highlights our Cadillac, DSD, Dynamic Screen Debugger sel-
ling for $195.00 plus S&H.   Also keystone of our software development system,
versatile and fast Zas, with Zlink, is featured.)

Amateur  Computerist  Corner:  The joy of learning is enhanced when  using  Z-
System--everywhere you turn is another surprise; another useful, but until the 
moment,  unknown welcomed feature!  You go for months like this, thinking each 
new  discovery is the last;  but surprise,  it seems to never stop...beat goes 
on!
     Alternate  telephone services seem to be giving lots of us  trouble  when 
attempting to access Z-Nodes and other BBS's.   Apparently the signal level is 
too  low  to  permit  carrier detection circuits  to  work  correctly.   Under 
conditions  where  you get an indication of connection followed  by  immediate 
lost of remote carrier,  try the conventional, high-priced long-distance tele-
phone service:   AT&T!   No entity (search the Cosmos,  if you will)  provides 
quality telephone service like erstwhile Ma-Bell.

AT&T profits not too bad!  Divestiture company earned $1.4 billion last fiscal 
year  (ending  31  December 1984),  versus projected $2.1,  on  sales  of  $33 
billion.  For a company having $40 billion assets, return on investment should 
be much better,  but could be worse.   Present calendar year should see battle 
lines fully drawn between them and IBM.   (AT&T's personal computer is said to 
be  twice  as  fast as IBM's;  that makes it as quick as our  S-100  4mHz  Z80 
systems.)  What will the future hold?  Lo!  Behold!  the future is now!
