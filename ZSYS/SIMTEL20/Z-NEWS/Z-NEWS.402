Comment Line.   Time invested in learning software and money spent on hardware 
makes us all want  to continue  pushing 8-bit computing.   We don't quickly or
easily discard what has  served  so  well, provided base to think freely, open
our minds, learn.  It's fact!  
     You  notice  we  go against grain,  don't troop (Z-News  304),  offer  an 
alternative that's upward-compatible with CP/M,  similar to UNIX, but fast and 
efficient:   Z-System,  an 8-bit OS soon to have multitasking capability added 
to its other present big-system features.
     By summer we should have new elements in place (Z-News 401), debugged, to 
permit  8-bit systems to communicate over local area networks and  to  control 
and be controlled by 16/32/64-bit machines running other OSs.  And coming from 
others,  industry-standard  bit-mapped  graphics interface  packages  will  be 
available.
     Z-System  multitasking means low-priority tasks get processed  when  main 
processor  unit has time to work with them.  Top priority is always  given  to 
task the console (keyboard and CRT) is associated with.  Nonetheless, operator 
is alerted through screen status window when background tasks need  attention, 
i.e., input from keyboard. 

FLASH.   Ready now!  We have ZCPR3 extended TCAP business-graphics  (straight-
lines,  squared  corners,  intersects, and boxes)  provided  by  modern  ASCII 
terminals,  e.g.,  TeleVideo 950/955, Wyse 50, Qume 108, etc.,  in  GRXLIB.REL 
library,  written by Z-Team member, Dennis Wright.  Plus windows!  Yes, up  to 
16 of them using new GRWLIB.REL library, also from Dennis.  (Small windows are 
used to monitor concurrent task status in multitasking OS.)
     Primitives handle everything for you, make job intuitive.  Simple syntax:
function  call followed by (in decimal notation) row, column, length,  height, 
direction, etc., as appropriate for particular drawing.  Next newsletter shows 
what  our kind of graphics and windows look like--beautiful.  Price is  $49.00 
for the two REL libraries on disk and online and printed documentation.
     We  ponder impact of graphics and windows on our tools and utilities,  on 
8-bit application programs in general.  Z-Nodes presently have a demonstration 
file (GRXDEMO.LBR) to show what can be accomplished with graphics and windows.
     Presently  over 32 subroutines exist to handle new functions.   Functions 
like DRVERT, DRHORZ, DRBOX, OPENW, WXYMSG, and CLEARW for draw vertical  line, 
draw horizontal line, draw box, open window, write text at window row, column, 
and clear contents of an open window, respectively.  Windows are numbered from 
1  to 16.  Windows may overlap on screen, be used as panels and tiles,  or  be 
pop-up style.
     Example (sample code fragment placed in utility or application program):

    ext    wxymsg     ;reference routines to fetch at link time..
    ext    drbox      ;..from GRXLIB and GRWLIB libraries
           ...
    call   drbox      ;draw a box using graphics characters
    db     2,3,6,34   ;box upper left row, column, box height, width
           ...
    call   wxymsg     ;print message at window row and column
    db     5,2,4      ;window number, window row and column
    db     'After selecting options, please'   ;msg first line
    db     'Strike Any Key to continue... ',0  ;msg ending

DOUBLE FLASH!   No later than 15 February ZCPR3: The Libraries ships.   Loose-Šleaf,  3-M  ring plastic binding, 8.5" by 11.0", 300+  pages,  comprehensively 
cross  indexed  by  subroutine  name,  chapter-named  logical  function,   and 
relocatable library name.  Extensive Table of Contents (TOC), 5 pages.  Dozens 
of  examples  make  learning easy.  Now there's no excuse  to  not  learn  the 
advantages of structured assembly language programming.  Author, Richard Conn, 
using both Reference Manual and User's Guide sections of The Libraries,  takes 
reader  by the hand, and together, walk the path of learning efficient  design 
and coding techniques.  We are taking orders now for The Libraries.  Price  is 
$29.95, plus $4.00 shipping and handling if within USA.
     Incidentally,   manual  covers  Rick's  recently   completed   subroutine 
expansions,  SYSLIB  Version  3.6, Z3LIB Version 1.3, and  VLIB  Version  1.1.
Loose-leaf book makes it easy to keep up with changes--simply add and  replace 
pages as changes occur.  New price for 9 to 12 diskette set (number depends on 
computer   disk   size  and  format),  including  source   code   and   online 
documentation, is $69.00.
     Entire  libraries package, book, graphics documentation,  SYSLIB,  Z3LIB, 
VLIB,  GRXLIB, and GRWLIB, is discount priced at $129.00, a saving  of  $18.95 
from individual package purchases.  Order now.

Z TIPS.   ZRDOS COMP utility, Version 2.8, with trailing T option for  setting 
Register 9 (of ZCPR3 REG utility) with codes 0 to 3, indicating files  (source 
and destination) not found, and files are either identical or different, makes 
for some interesting possibilities.  Updating backup-disks from RAM disk,  and 
loading or re-loading RAM disk from hard or floppy disk, come to mind.   Using 
GOTO  loop,  AC36  archive-bit file copy, and IF13  wild  card  file  matching 
capabilities, it should be possible to create a ZEX file completely automating 
all-important disk backup chores.
     Single file copy offering (COPYIF.ZEX, on Z-Nodes) from Dennis Wright:

COMP $1 $2 /T  ;note compare two files with test-only option
IF 9 1         ;note if source not found
  ECHO -- $1 NOT FOUND
ELSE
  IF 9 2       ;note if destination not found
    ECHO -- DESTINATION FILE DOES NOT EXIST, COPYING $1 TO DESTINATION
    AC $2=$1
  ELSE
    IF 9 3     ;note if difference found
      ECHO -- FILES ARE DIFFERENT, UPDATING $2 WITH $1
      AC $2=$1
    ELSE
      ECHO -- FILES ARE IDENTICAL, UPDATE NOT REQUIRED
    FI         ;note if 9 3
  FI           ;note if 9 2
FI             ;note if 9 1

Syntax  is COPYIF <du:source filename> <du:destination filename><cr>.   Script 
works  as  alias  or, as Dennis suggested, ZEX file.  Now,  think  of  another 
level,  that  uses  above script to process one file, that  allows  wild  card 
declared  files, each file handled by Dennis's script as nested alias in  GOTO 
loop.  Okay, we think!
     New  subject.   A neat CMD command line we use under VFILER to  edit  and 
auto  back-up files you might wish to experiment with (also try in a  MENU  or 
VMENU  command line, but don't forget to alter for syntax differences  between 
VFILER and menus):

1 %d%u:;nw %f;if12 %f=z.?0?;ac BACKUP:=%f /a;fiŠ
Pointer  file (%f is full file name) is called to load under Newword  (or  any 
other word processor or editor).  After edit session, if file matches wildcard 
name  (using  IF12 or later version to determine), it is  auto  copied  (using 
ZRDOS  AC)  to  BACKUP directory disk, but only if file has  been  altered  by 
editing.   Notice  how we hard log into current  directory--make  current  the 
default--before  calling  editor.  Such allows moving from user area  to  user 
area, finding pointer file, with BAK file created by edit process placed where 
it  logically should go:  on current drive in current user area.  (See page  4 
below for another assembly automation script.)

PRODUCT REVIEW.   Newword word processor (Version 2.17 sells for $125.00  plus 
$4.00 S&H) from Newstar Software, Inc., 1601 Oak Park Blvd., Pleasant Hill, CA 
94523,  telephone 415/932-2526, looks good to us because, among other  things, 
it tells of useò areas.  And has lots of printer support, 
including  HP LaserJet (though not  with 
justified,  proportional  spacing)   and 
late-model dot matrix types.  And  after 
using WordStar for years, to use Newword        Sketch of White Knight and
is like coming home to a freshly painted               Queen Alice.
house,  like  finding  a  little  of  El 
Dorado.    NW  is  a  superset  of   WS.  
Newstar supports 8-bit computing; Sorcim 
is  another!  (Ashton-Tate and  MicroPro 
go way of DRI, forget their origins?)
     In   this   one   package   there's 
Mergeprint,  like  WordStar's  MailMerge 
but  more  conditional  IF,  THEN,  ELSE 
testing  possibilities available, up  to 
three lines for header and footer  text, 
and   most  importantly,   an   undelete 
command.   The  latter (command  is  ^U) 
lets you recover a word, line, or  block 
of text accidently erased, something  WS 
has  needed from its beginning.   And  a 
^QS  save  quickly brings  you  back  to 
exactly where you were in the file.  You 
don't end at beginning of file and  have 
to enter ^QP to return to where you were 
before save.
     Another feature is automatic whole-
document   reform,   in   addition    to 
paragraph-at-a-time,  with ^QB  command.  
In  find (search) and  replace  function 
there's   an  option  R  for  "rest   of 
document," in addition to global; latter 
starts  at beginning of file and is  not 
always  desired.   Command ^QP  finds  a 
numbered page.  The column replace  (^KI 
in  addition to ^KN, WS's  column  mode) 
command  requires no  reformatting  when 
moving columns around.  And there's six, 
instead of four, user functions (^PQ,^PW,^PE,^PR,^P[, and ^P]) to control  the 
printer.
     If you are in a user area other than zero, sorted file directory and main 
menus  (but  not status line) show both area and drive.  Main menu  L  command 
permits logging into any user area.  And PUBLIC ZRDOS Plus makes using NW from Šany  directory,  as  with WS, a snap, with but one copy of  main  program  and 
overlays  on disk system.  Incidentally, NW can be installed to have  internal 
directory  not display COM, REL, OVR, and other files a text editor  shouldn't 
be  used on.  WS directory function seems to fall apart after about  70  files 
are included, shows all files in strange sort.
     A  feature hard to describe, must see to appreciate fully:  the  .RM  and 
once, WS only one.  These two commands permit many indents and different right 
margins to exist in a single file.  The below-status-line ruler showing  left, 
right  margins and tab stops in effect automatically change as you,  within  a 
file, cross over an RM or LM dot statement--real video magic!
     Number of copies to print is built-in and selected as response to  prompt 
(default  is one copy).  Multiple printer drivers are also built-in,  so  only 
one copy of installed program need be resident to control several printers you 
use.   One  thing  lacking is ability to print a file  from  within  the  edit 
session--that  we miss!  (Feature in not included because of concern for  data 
security;  NSI  is  a conservative company.)  And also the  tight  spacing  of 
punctuation  provided by WS is not performed by NW; that too we miss.  But  NW 
microjustify algorithm more closely follows classical typographical  standards 
than  does  WS.  To justify right margin, white space is added  between  words 
rather  than between characters of words.  Overall effect is more pleasing  to 
the  eye in former case; WS uses latter.  Compare printing of Z-News 402  with 
401.
     Newword impresses as refined product, developed by people who knew how to 
design  a  super word processor.  Though NW and WS  operations  are  similar--
commands  are  near identical--we know NW to be an original work  of  art  and 
recommend  it  to anyone wishing a full-feature word processing  program.   We 
have seen none better, few as good.  (Next, we review a super spelling checker 
from CompuView.)

From Our Mail Box.   Mike Lambert, 1153 Dublin Place, Herndon, VA 22070, signs 
up  as Good-Neighbor Helper.  He runs an Eagle IIE and has full  knowledge  of 
what  it  takes  to install ZCPR3.  Give Mike a call if  you  need  assistance 
getting Z3 installed.  His voice telephone is 703/471-0429.
     Mark  Little, Z-Node #50, also signs up as Good-Neighbor Helper.   Mark's 
new  address  and  home voice phone is 1 Waving Court,  Alice  Springs,  N.T., 
Australia   5750,  (089)  528  230.   Down-under  folks  needing   help   with 
understanding  Z-System should give him a call, especially if using Big  Board 
I.
     "ZCPR3 is great and I don't know how I ever lived without it this  long!" 
from Art Carlson, publisher of The Computer Journal.  Art, if more writers and 
editors took the time, as you have, to get Z-System running on their machines, 
they too would understand what we have been reporting for so long.  Alas, such 
people are too busy with bigger and more important things than 8-bit software.
     "I  am glad you are still in business and supporting the  non-IBM  world.
You  have  spent  a lot of money on newsletters to me and  I  am  enclosing  a 
check...  " comes from Bob Chappelear, Cincinnati, OH.  Thanks for  money  and 
words of encouragement, Bob; we could use a little more of both.
     Another  writes  to add his name to Good-Neighbor  Helper  Roster:   Mike 
Blackwell,  for  Otrona assistance, One South 135 Eliot Lane, Villa  Park,  IL 
60181,  312/882-4673.   Thanks,  Mike, for joining list  of  helpers--we  need 
assistance from all corners.

Amateur Z User's Corner.   Lots of you are getting your feet wet with assembly 
language programming using Z-System source code as a base.  A neat CMD command 
line  we  use  here,  instead of a ZEX file, you may wish  to  try  when  next 
developing  a  changed  program.   It's our number 2  macro  command  used  by 
VFILER.CMD in ASM directory:Š
2 %d%u:;if12 %f=*.z80;zas %n;if ~er;zlink %d:%n,a:z3lib/,a:vlib/,
  a:syslib/;era %n.rel;era %n.bak;echo done;else;echo errors - link
  cancelled;fi;else;echo file not z80 type;fi

We  use  Version  2.2a of ZAS which sets the ZCPR3 error message  flag  if  an 
assembly error occurs.  (Any who bought or upgraded to 2.2 may receive a  free 
update,  if original diskette is returned along with $4.00 to  cover  shipping 
and handling.)
     Simply  point to the file to be assembled and linked from REL to COM  and 
VFILER  does  the  rest.   If you point to a file not of  type  Z80,  you  are 
informed;  general  housekeeping is automatic, erasing BAK and REL  files  not 
normally  required.  Of course similar command script can be used to  do  just 
about  anything  you  need  to do, greatly reducing  the  number  of  required 
keystrokes (and inevitable typing errors) from you.
     Notice  we  log into current directory as script is  executed.   We  have 
found  this  generally better than staying with the default being  other  than 
current.   Using many directory areas, moving freely from one to another,  and 
still  have  CMD  script work correctly with a  wide  variety  of  application 
situations is what we seek.
     Don't  forget  command line (CL) length limitation  (SHOW  utility  tells 
length  available;  use  #1 menu.) of  approximately  200  characters.   Also, 
remember  alias parameters are expanded and actual command stings usually  are 
longer than script character count.

Z-Node  Activity.   Another node online--Peter Glaskowsky, 13421 SW 69  Court, 
Miami,  FL  33156, signs as Z-Node #53.  Remember from Z-News 309, Pete  is  a 
Lobo  MAX-80  expert.  Dial, hopefully using Term3  *.TXD  telephone  library, 
305/235-1645 to reach him.
     Jim  Altman, Z-Node #46, with his 200 megabyte hard disk system  (see  Z-
News  309), signs up as downloader of EI proprietary software.   Atlanta  area 
computerists  wishing  to  buy Z-System packages, and also  those  wishing  to 
check-out such a big system, should give Jim's node a call: 404/627-7127.
     And,  Sysop  Richard Jacobson adds another telephone line to  his  Z-Node 
#15,  has two RAS numbers.  New, second line is devoted to Z-System  software; 
original line is more general.  Try 312/664-1730 for pure Z, 312/649-1730  for 
normal node.

Announcement.    Trenton Computer Festival (conference and  swap-meet)  occurs 
19, 20 April this year.  Richard Conn is a featured speaker with two  subjects 
scheduled: (1) Ada Language and (2) Z-System Evolution.  Trenton, in its  11th 
year,  is the oldest of such microcomputer gatherings.  Plan to  attend.   Who 
knows,  you may see Dennis Wright, Dave McCord, or other members of  Echelon's 
team  there, along with, for sure, Steve Ciarcia, Steve Leon, and  Sol  Libes, 
and maybe, Irv Hoff.

Doings.    High  level  language,  Modula 2,  being  developed  to  take  full 
advantage of Micromint SB180 computer and Hitachi HD64180 processor  features, 
includes  use  of  large  memory address  space  and  hardware  multiply  (MLT 
instruction,  see Z-News 208).  In beat test now, designed by none other  than 
Borland  International, Scotts Valley, CA, 408/438-8400.  If  consistent  with 
Borland's  normal  pricing,  should  be economical  to  buy.   (Early  testing 
indicates it's much faster than Tubro Pascal on a Z80.)
     Mr.  Robert Andrews, Zilog marketing manager for new  products,  recently 
told  us of progress made with their Z800 chip, the one  code-compatible  with 
Z80.   He reports giving up design of NMOS product because of internal  micro-
thermal  hot  spots,  have converted the product to  low  power  CMOS.   First Šversion  will  run at 10 mHz with execution through-puts of from  1.1  to  5.2 
MIPS,  depending  on  instruction mix (sounds like a 5  or  6  stage  pipeline 
design).   Chip has on-board MMU, DMA, cache memory, UART, and CTCs.   Perhaps 
Hitachi  HD64180  will have competition in third quarter of  1986,  when  Z800 
full-production is scheduled.  What a wait this is!

One  More Time.   Many computer magazine editors have little or no  investment 
in  or emotion for our industry or its hardware.  But they  heavily  influence 
the  reading  majority.   Yet  these same editors  seem  to  realize  not  the 
importance  of their leadership positions, seem to take the easy, shallow  way 
to  living.  They sense not the opening available to each of them; they  don't 
go  for IT!  They tread, they grind; but what a drag!  You notice they  seldom 
say anything that offends anyone; you notice they remind melba toast.  If  you 
follow  their recommendations and you happen to come up short, what have  they 
lost?   They simply recommend another of the many similar products  available.
They show little love!  Remember, their revenue comes mainly from advertisers, 
not  from  you  their readers.  But increasingly, anything  that  is  not  IBM 
compatible  won't  fly well in corporate America, or with  these  editors  and 
their
reporting staff.  What do estimated over-2-million CP/M users read?  Not much!
     What  grade are we in?  Do we troop, live deeply; are we less than  high-
grade?  See you down the lines...
