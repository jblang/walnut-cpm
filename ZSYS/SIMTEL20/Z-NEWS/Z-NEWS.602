Version  3.0  of ZCPR is released, with 3.3 pending; latest ZRDOS is  1.7  and 
remains priced at $59.50.  Upgrades are only $20.00, for those using Z-COM  or 
earlier versions of ZRDOS.  Item 12 on Price List.
  
Z  Tips.    Notice Version 1.4e of DSD is shipping.   Screen-oriented,  multi-
window utility is best debugger/simulator available for high-performance 8-bit 
systems,  bar none.  Author, John Otken, intends to keep it that way.   REALLY 
SPEEDS  DEBUGGING  CODE!  New release supports Hitachi  HD64180  extended  Z80 
instruction  set, and has backtrace facilities similar to a  word  processor's 
"undo"  key.   Auto-installs  to ZCPR3 TCAP environment.   Over  60  commands.
Elegant.  Still only $129.95, Item 23 on Price List.  Because of new,  easier-
to-use  135-page  manual,  upgrade price to those  with  previous  version  is 
$30.00, instead of usual $20.00, plus S&H.
     --------------------------------------------------------------------
     BPrinter, Version 1.1, adds a new mode of operation useful for situations 
where  complex  ESCape  character  sequences are  contained  in  files  to  be 
"background"  printed.  Mode needed when using, e.g., I/O Recorder to  capture 
Newword  or  WordStar  output  for proportional  spacing  printers.   Now  new 
"verbatim"  mode is used for these situations but v1.1 retains  "normal"  mode 
for  expanding tabs in "straight" text files.  (See Z-User's Corner below  for 
alias  using  I/OR and BPrinter.)  Offered for $39.95 plus S&H.   Upgrade  for 
$20.00.  Requires ZRDOS 1.1 or later and IOP installed.
     Lots of magazine pieces published about things of interest.  The Computer 
Journal, Issue #25, has three; one by Jay Sage (Z-Node #3) detailing ZSIG/NAOG 
purposes;  one by Morris Simon (Consultant, Tuscaloosa, AL)  comparing  manual 
versus auto install ZCPR3 and Z-System, with much supportive background.   And 
one  by  Rick  Lehrbaum (Ampro Computers) showing how to  build  an  SCSI  bus 
adapter.  Micro/Systems Journal, Sept/Oct 1986, Vol.2/No.5, has one by Richard 
Conn  (ZCPR3  author) on advantages of designing and  writing  programs  using 
SYSLIB, Z3LIB, and VLIB in Z80 and HD64180 computer environments.
     Hurray!   Now  The Word Plus, spelling check and  correction  system,  is 
bundled  with Newword from Newstar Software, Z-News 402/403.  Price  is  still 
only $125.00.  Such a deal!
     Just  released ZRDOS v1.7 is fast, as announced in Z-News  601-1.   Going 
from one drive to another is near instant.  Warm boot occurs fast, much faster 
than  under  CP/M 2.2, and does not change R/O status of files or  disk,  hard 
disk  partition  or  floppy  drive.   But,  programs  directly  altering  disk 
directory  tracks  require running DISKRST immediately after exit,  to  update 
changed  disk parameters.  We speak of programs classified as "disk  editors."
UNERASE  and DU3 are examples.  Remember alias UNERA of Z-News 507-2?   Here's 
one  just as simple but for DU3 sessions:  du312;diskrst.  We call alias  DU3.
It  uses  latest version of DU3, 3.12.  Type DU3<cr> and DISKRST,  ZRDOS  v1.7 
utility, is automatically run on exit from DU312.
     No  grass  growing  under  compression-expert  Steven  Greenberg's  feet.
Designs  and  codes  a greatly improved, faster,  more  flexible,  and  better 
compression ratios, releases Version 2.0 of CRUNCH.  Our "library"  423-record 
test  file  of Z-News 508-4 compressed to 225 records versus 266  for  SQUEEZE 
v1.11, 246 for CRUNCH v1.1.  Complete package (with support TYPE and UNCR, and 
REL code ready to be used by other written-in-linkable-MicroSoft-format tools) 
is on Z-Nodes everywhere and on SUS diskette #6.  We must get to putting  UNCR 
into NULU, VTYPE, and VFILER.  Advantages of CRUNCH are so great, SQUEEZE  now 
seems  very inadequate.  Caveat: Versions 1.x of CRUNCH are incompatible  with 
2.0 and later.  So keep both 1.x and 2.x to be able to UNCR any crunched  file 
that comes along.
     Richard  Charnes,  Berkeley, CA, has taken shells and  aliases  under  Z-
System to heart.  Library file TLF.LBR is recent result.  TLF is a  type-file-
in-library utility.  File may be uncompressed, squeezed, or crunched.  Similar 
in concept to GLF, extract library files alias of Z-News 508, but uses  TYPELZ 
instead of LGET.  Thanks, Richard, for thinking about how to use tools of Z to 
your advantage, and ours.  TLF is on SUS #6 diskette and on many Z-Nodes.
     Echelon  bootable  disk  Z-System  for Kaypro  with  Advent  TurboROM  is 
shipping.   Offered for $69.95, is Item 13 on Price List.  Comes with  special 
70-page  tutorial-style manual written by Richard Jacobson and  Bruce  Morgen.
Those wanting to improve their Kaypros, any model or version, bootable disk Z-
System  is  your  opportunity,  with or  without  TurboROM.   No  installation 
hassles--three sizes of Z, ready to go to work for you.

String Searching, Continued.   Charles Kestner points out FYNDE is fastest  of 
"public domain" string searching utilities.  Program displays built-in help if 
only  verb  is  entered at command line.  We tested it on  our  two-file,  15-
character  string benchmark, Z-News 508-3, and was unable to get  better  than 
12.82  seconds  on  4mHz Z80 Ampro hard disk, 18.44 on 3ms  step-rate  96  tpi 
floppy.  (Remember, FIND54 took 9.56 and 17.38, respectively; FINDU, 24.02 and 
33.31.)   Since  FYNDE,  like FINDU, can search squeezed  files,  we  wouldn't 
expect it to be the fastest.  Definitely, FYNDE is faster than FINDU.  On  the 
other  hand,  FIND54 can output found-text-lines into a declared  file;  FYNDE 
cannot.
     We can tell that Bridger Mitchell, of Plu*Perfect Systems, is working  on 
a string-search program.  Knowing him, he will come up with something  unique, 
and desirable.  What have we started with this string search?  Well, interest!
In  finding  text  in  the most efficient manner, and  that's  good.   We  are 
benchmark and beta test site for Bridger, if he comes up with something faster 
than FIND54.  Good luck, one and all.

SUS  Report.   System Software Support diskette #6 fills but has a ways to  go 
to be full.

ZL2.ZEX  is a conditional batch file for programming assembly  language  using 
ZAS v2.4 and ZLINK v2.3, and Z3INS to auto-install a Z3 utility you worked on.
Similar to original ZL.ZEX by Dennis Wright, author of ZRDOS, but using  ZAS's 
error  detection ability instead of FINDERR.  ZNODES37.LZT requires UNCR  v2.0 
to  uncompress.   Of course, it's in CRUNCH20.LBR on #6 diskette.  If  any  of 
these  files are of interest, join our SUS ranks.  Z-News 507-1 contains  full 
details.

Z-User's  Corner.    The  alias mentioned above, BP,  Background  Print,  uses 
BPrinter  and  I/O Recorder.  But first some background.   Our  favorite  word 
processor  is Newword.  Compatible with WordStar, but with more  speed,  "dot" 
commands,  and control over printers.  Alas, Newword cannot print files  while 
editing like WordStar can.  However, with I/OR and BPrinter, Newword takes  on 
background  printing  power  superior to that  of  WordStar.   BP<cr>  command 
syntax.  BP.COM consists of

      ldr recorder.iop;record on p;nw;record off p;ldr bprinter.iop;  <<
      bprint v printer.fil;nw

RECORDER.IOP loads followed by RECORD diverting output from printer to default 
file, PRINTER.FIL.  Next Newword loads.  Then from main menu, you now  declare 
file to print using P command.  After Newword quickly completes "printing"  to 
file  PRINTER.FIL, you exit using X command.  Alias turns RECORD off and  runs 
BPRINT, using verbatim "V" option printing of PRINTER.FIL starts.  Returns you 
to  Newword  after printing starts, for simultaneous editing  while  printing.
Variations:  remove  "nw" command at end of alias returning  to  command  line 
prompt  after printing starts; use WordStar instead of Newword.   Other  vari-
ations of BP alias are equally possible to satisfy your needs.
     We use BPrinter, Version 1.1 and I/O Recorder, Version 1.7.  If you don't 
have  IOP  segment installed in your BIOS, now's the time to do it.   Wait  no 
longer.  Input/Output redirection opens doors to task automation.  Price  List 
Item 84, ZCPR3 and IOPs, by Richard Conn, explains step-by-step how to  modify 
your  BIOS  for  redirection.  Book assumes assembly  language  knowledge  for 
understanding.   Covers using DEV, DEVICE, and RECORD utilities.   Still  only 
$9.95 plus S&H.

From  Our  Mail  Box.    "Enclosed  is my  check  for  $24.00  for  my  Z-News 
subscription. ...and I'm not saying that I now know everything on my  computer 
but the challenge of your entire system drives me on.  Thanks for your support 
and Z-System."  writes William Fassnacht, McKinleyville, CA.
     Rick Swenton, Bristol, CT, reminds of, "...my latest work on 'Z' recently 
published  in the Heath/Zenith magazine, REMark."  That makes it three!   Rick 
has articles in Nov '85, Jan and Sept '86 issues of that magazine.  First  one 
was  on  characteristics of ZCPR3; second, on Z-System in  general;  and  now, 
bootable  disk  version of Z-System created and sold by  Analytical  Products, 
Woodlake,  CA,  under license from Echelon.  In his letter,  Rick  gives  high 
praise--we do too--to "master" Richard Conn, Dennis Wright, and Peter Shkabara 
for  their work (Z-News 309-1/2, 501-3, and 502-5).  Now maybe, Rick, you  are 
ready to do a book review of Z-System User's Guide.  Just maybe...and we  need 
articles  showing  what aliases combined with Z-System facilities can  do  for 
computer users.

Z-Node  Activity.   Bob Peddicord, back online with Z-Node #60 after  a  move.

     Robert  Hootman  assists  Richard  Peterson, Z-Node  #31,  El  Paso,  TX, 
915/821-3638,  handling  "The  Pass" sysop duties.  They  have  100  megabytes 
online using Heath H89 and Ampro "Little Board" Z80 computers.
     Four new Z-Nodes come online, while nine inactives have been dropped from 
roster.  File ZNODES37.LQT has latest information on Z-Nodes.
     Carol  Miller,  Enid, OK 73702, 405/237-9890, becomes  Z-Node  #33,  "EDP 
Consultants" node.  Carol is into data processing, you see!
     Ben Grey fills big, long-time void in Portland, OR, area managing  Z-Node 
#24,  503/644-4621;  and also in Oregon, Ken Jones, Z-Node  #4,  503/370-7655, 
complements  Bob  Peddicord,  both in Selma, OR.  Ken  calls  his  node  "Time 
Taker."  We guess "time" refers to his, ours, and yours.
     Finally,  Mississauga,  Ontario, Canada, gets Z-Node  #18.   Bruce  Smith 
handles sysop chores from 416/823-4521.

Add  these  measurements  to those of Z-News 409 and 501  and  a  full-picture 
emerges.   Sieve tests here were run using only one iteration, instead of  10, 
as  has been done in past times.  One iteration seems to be  more  appropriate 
for relative slow micros, to speed comparative testing.

Lunch  Break.    Week  of 8 September 1986 saw record sell-off  of  stocks  by 
institutional buyers, selling based mainly on advice of computer programs.  We 
wonder  if  many  sellers  understand principles  used  for  their  computer's 
decision  to  output  such  advice.  Same holds  for  users  of  spread  sheet 
equations  developed by someone else.  Seems end users are now pawns of  those 
who develop programs that make decisions.  Think!  Most of these programs  are 
static, have old data, not updated by day-to-day thinking of human beings.
     It's  up to 150 now, and count continues...we see yen rising  to  120-to-
the-dollar in a year or two.  Remember ratio, not too long ago, was 240 or so.
Dollar and zen value are covered in Z-News 502-2.  Oh! What webs we weave...
     Sol  Libes  does  it again--sells magazine he  founded,  but  remains  as 
editor.   Yes, M&T Publishing, publisher of Dr. Dobb's Journal has taken  over 
Micro/Systems  Journal...hopefully, and we believe it, good things  will  come 
from  such  a  relationship.  Both DDJ and MS/J, over  the  years,  have  been 
significant  sources for news and technical information  about  microcomputers 
and  its industry doings.  We wish Sol, Lennie, Don, and Susan good  luck  and 
happiness in their new business relationship.
     We usually view Z-News equally as art-form and newsletter, much like folk 
music  with hard social-issue lyrics.  We go from sea-shore through desert  to 
mountain-top generating technical descriptions, industry coverage, and  cross-
grain  philosophy.   Span far and wide, provoke.  All to break  molds,  change 
ruts into groves, generate new thought.  (In fact, we write this Z-News  issue 
on-the-move  within  California's  Sierra  Nevada/Madre--snow-covered,  mother 
range--with  elevations over 10,000 feet.  Easy mentally to get aloft at  such 
altitudes.  It's not the end of the world, but you can see it from here.)
    Work  should  be for more than money, for more than a pay check,  but  for 
learning, for purpose.  Then, life takes on meaning.  Purpose has value of and 
within  itself, like colors.  Sure, colors--red, green, blue,  and  mixtures--
have purpose.  Here we go again, provoking...lunch is over.
     ====================================================================
Of Angels and Eagles.    We grope, as in darkness, trying to make sense of our 
surroundings.  We started as wanderers and we remain so.  The meanest among us 
can  be as big as our continent, we homo sapients striving to  become  thrice-
sapient.  We must go where we have not been, we wanderers, but...
     Morality  plays  such a small part in what we do.  (Yet a  golden  thread 
still  runs among us, bonds us...usually pull for underdog  in  competitions.)
Economics subconsciously top our priority list, both individually and collect-
ively, nationally.  No matter what we say, actions speak louder.  What we  are 
totally masks any words we use to describe ourselves.
     Actions proclaim, manifest being.  We promote liberty within our borders, 
shout  its  merits wide and far.  But abroad, economic issues  take  priority, 
rule  what  we  do,  how we behave.  We seem to care not  with  what  form  of 
government  we deal, so long as we benefit financially from our  relationship.
Liberty at home, bondage abroad.  Latin America is best case in point, covered 
by  the  Monroe Doctrine.  We "own" South American people, to do  with  as  we 
please.   And  our  pleasure is to use their natural and  human  resources  to 
"ease"  our  lives  in  USA.  We forget  these  Latins,  these  Hispanics  are 
Americans  and co-inhabitants of the planet.  But, our policies drive them  to 
take  sides.  With Communist help, new unions are being formed against us,  in 
West  versus East struggle.  Why has this happened?  No one to blame?   Simply 
human nature unfolding: history, as is being made in South Africa today?   But 
window  for action, for leadership is closing.  (Please read again  definition 
of  money, Z-News 305-5; levels of morality, 408-3; and, whole being,  305-2.)
We  should  encourage  same swiftness, same quality  of  leadership  shown  by 
Afrikaners  in  pointing  way  to  end  British  colonialism  (a   colonialism 
essentially  economic  in character) at beginning of 20th century  (Boer  War, 
1899-1902).  Leadership, we need it now!  If Western world doesn't provide it, 
who will?  See you down the lines...
