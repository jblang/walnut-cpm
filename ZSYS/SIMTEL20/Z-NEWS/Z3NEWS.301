Z TIPS:  From Jim Whorton (Wichita,  KS), VDO editor author, comes an alias to 
create flavors of VDO, Version 2.5a, having different defaults.  Using POKE&GO 
technique suggested by Bruce Morgen (Warminster,  PA), two or more versions of 
editor  are  available with single copy on disk!   See Z-News 107 and 109  for 
WordStar pokes.  Alias, call it VDN, in sample command line:  VDN [fn.ft]<cr>. 
Command elements of alias:

 1 --> GET 100 A0:VDO.COM    |Load VDO.COM into memory from declared drive
 2 --> POKE 1B17 03;         |Set help level, 01=expert, 02=regular, 03=novice
 3 --> POKE 1A5C 00;         |Set insert toggle, 00=OFF, 80=ON
 4 --> GO $1                 |Run VDO with any supplied arguments

Jim finishes a version of VDO that uses ZCPR3 Environment Descriptor (SYS.ENV, 
Z3.ENV,  and ZC.ENV) for terminal and system definition.   Hope he includes DU 
and DIR directory reference forms, as well as knowledge of system environment. 
Coding with VLIB,  Z3LIB,  and SYSLIB subroutines makes these additions  easy. 
We welcome his fast, memory-oriented editor as a proper Z-System utility.
     Jay  Sage's VALIAS is big hit--breaks alias-creation/modification bottle-
neck!   Jay's program permits changing, or adding, individual commands without 
retyping the whole alias.   And it's screen oriented with built-in, in-context 
help--so easy to use.   Rumor has it that Bruce Morgen is tightening the  code 
using ZAS and full Z-80 mnemonics.   Meanwhile, Richard Conn's MKALIAS takes a 
different but just as fruitful path.  More about it as it matures.  Can't wait 
to release both alias utilities!
     During the same period,  Richard has produced a virtual cornucopia of new 
Z-System programs and updates.   Look for just-out LRUN,  LDIR,  LHELP library 
utilities using automatic unsqueeze techniques,  updates to XD, CRC, DIFF, and 
more.   Also a new set of routines,  LULIB, is being added to REL library trio 
SYSLIB, Z3LIB, and VLIB.  Find foursome source code on some Z-Nodes!  
     Simultaneously,  he  finished  new SYSLIB,  Version  3.3,  offering  many 
additional  routines.   Stimulated by suggestions from Don Delwood  (Columbia, 
MO),  quick  Richard developed eighteen (18) computed-GOTO and CASE  routines. 
While at it, he added a Unix-style (ARGV) string parser and several arithmetic 
IF routines.   New routines in Version 3.2 and 3.3 greatly assisted in writing 
Term3.   SYSLIB grows in strength, more to come (Richard still has "libraries" 
checked-out)!
     On subject of libraries, Martin Murray (Austin, TX), author of NULU super 
library file manager,  is said to be making his program a full ZCPR3 utility--
hurray!
     Be sure to get and try Paul Pomerleau's new VERROR handler.  Has built-in 
WordStar-like  editor to alter unexecutable commands on the spot.   Similar to 
ERROR23, but with different taste.
     So  many new utilities support Z-System!   It's worthwhile to  read  what 
Richard  Conn  had to say about creating utilities,  "I encourage everyone  to 
enjoy their ZCPR3 system,  write tools for it, and contribute them to the user 
community."   Read his full commentary in 12 November 1984 Newsletter 009,  on 
page 4.

Z-Node Activity:  Three new nodes started operation during fortnight.  Chicago 
suburb  (Lisle) Sysop,  Ron Stone,  Node #5,  has 40-megabytes  online.   Such 
capacity shares call-traffic with Node #15, Richard Jacobson, in greater Windy 
City area.  Contact Ron (and Z-Msg) by dialing 312/420-1722.  Richard's number 
remains 312/649-1730.
     Z-Node  #28  Sysop,  Stanley London,  informs us he is up and running  in 
Aurora (Denver), CO.  His mile-high number is 303/680-9825.
     Welcome!   Marvin Eyre, Z-Node #37 Sysop, is up...plans to expand soon to 
hard disk operation.  Call his Robards, KY, node at 502/521-7011.
     You  asked for it!   You now have it--a compiled list of current  Z-Nodes 
(file Z-NODES.LST)!   Sysop name,  city, state, zip code, and telephone number 
will  be kept up-to-date.   As RAS (remote access system,  more  accurate  and 
descriptive  than  BBS expression;  a Z-Node is a RAS)  changes  occur,  we'll 
update in timely fashion.  You help by leaving message if you see inaccuracies 
in file.
     Also don't forget, especially if you use Tandy machines, Jon Schneider in 
El Paso, TX.  Jon joins Richard Peterson (The Pass Sysop) to handle traffic in 
southwest Texas area.  His number is 915/592-4976; Richard's, 915/821-3638.

Notice to DISCAT Owners:  We found and fixed output-to-printer bug in CATSCAN. 
If  you return your original,  disk we update free!   This we feel we owe you; 
it's not an upgrade, simply a fix.

Amateur  Z  User's  Corner:  New comers to computers  expect  much  more  than 
received,  at  least  on-surface,  from  their  systems.   Most  want  instant 
productivity increase, gratification, to learn little from potential perpetual 
experience.    Let  it  be  proclaimed:   gratification  comes  from  personal 
accomplishment   through  work--work  that  changes,   adds  to  your   Being. 
Frustration  over-come  gracefully develops extended  character,  a  character 
tender  as  a  Lotus,  tough as a stone.   Happiness  is  path  followed,  not 
destination  to arrive at!   It comes from each achievement being perceived as 
higher (greater, of more importance) than any previous.  So, when things don't 
go  as  planned,  computer acts against your  intentions,  relax--study  again 
available material--try again.  From such efforts we learn what we don't know, 
what we are,  how computer works,  how we fit in!  Z-System users are destined 
to be golden boys and girls of this marvelous decade.
    We wait for early Spring (of Life), when flowers bloom and robins sing!
Now,  disk drives and their number.   A     one-disk system is not easy to use 
because  of difficulty making backups.   There are single-drive copy  programs 
that  make  operations as convenient as possible,  but still process  is  time 
consuming  and distracting.   A two-drive system has been standard  with  most 
desktop  computers.   Here,  disk swapping is greatly reduced,  but still much 
removing  of  system   disk (boot disk) with data  disks  occurs.   The  ideal 
minimum  for  maximum  ease of use is three  (3)!   Drive  A  contains  system 
utilities and often-used application programs; Drive B holds working data disk 
with Drive C used for automatic Drive B backup.
     More  than  three  drives  (logical and physical) simply  are  needed  as 
storage requirements increase,  otherwise making number of files per directory 
too large (Z supports 32 directories per logical drive).  We personally prefer 
less than 100 entries per user area (directory,  DU or DIR reference).  VFILER 
handles up to 72 files per screen display;  more than 144 on a directory slows 
down  operations having to switch through three or more screens to  cover  all 
files.
     Notice  the situation represented by menus of MENU.LBR (128k-byte file on 
Z-Nodes).   AC  of  ZRDOS  archives certain files after  they  chance  without 
operator concern.   Of course,  Drives A and B are normally logicals of single 
physical hard disk; and C, high-capacity (greater than 360k-byte) floppy.
     From Steven Hirsch (Burlington, VT):  those needing help in understanding 
aspects  of  ZCPR3 and Z-System should feel free to contact one of  our  good-
neighbor helpers. These volunteers are listed in file Z-HELPR8.BBS on Z-Nodes. 
All are ready to assist pushing you over some hurdle.   Steven is an Apple and 
Z3  expert.   His  number is 802/658-4793.   Try him (and Doug Thom  or  Kevin 
McDonald,   both  Apple  experts,   at  408/253-1306  and  new   408/462-3731, 
respectively)  and other good-neighbor helpers before calling us!   They  want 
your calls and letters.

Software  Bug  Reporting:  We request that our "Software Update Form" be  used 
for all bug reporting plus suggestions relative to products or  services.   We 
simply  cannot efficiently comprehend from verbal inputs your  requests.   The 
form  suggests the information we need to act on your problems and enhancement 
suggestions.  Please!

One   More  Time:   ZCPR3  and  ZRDOS  programs  (Z-System)  are  not   public 
domain...copyrighted by Richard Conn and Dennis Wright,  assigned to  Echelon. 
While  we welcome users enhancing ZCPR3 programs (we fix ZRDOS),  we are final 
authority as to acceptability of changes.  Procedure for updating:  1) from Z-
Node  Central  (either  from  direct chat with David  McCord  or  with  posted 
message) obtain permission to work on file,  2) then obtain latest version  of 
program from official area (ZCPR3) of Z-Node Central,  and 3) finally,  return 
your  updated  version  within agreed upon period of  time,  or  determine  if 
extension  is  possible.   So much extra work has been caused by some few  who 
have used other than latest versions,  or didn't check file out  first.   Only 
one  version  may be active at once!   If your ideas deserve a new name for  a 
program  then proceed that way.   Understand Echelon supports  these  programs 
with  OEM's  and  VAR's  (without which we cannot be  in  business)  and  must 
maintain absolute control.  So be it!

From  Page One of ZCPR3:_The_Manual:  "In the development of our understanding 
of complex phenomena,  the most powerful tool available to the human intellect 
is abstraction.  Abstraction arises from a recognition of similarities between 
certain objects,  situations, or processes in the real world, and the decision 
to  concentrate on these similarities,  and to ignore for the time  being  the 
differences."
     In  addition to explaining over 90 commands,  both resident and  utility, 
manual has individual chapters covering online HELP,  MENU and VMENU,  Shells, 
VFILER, and DU3.  Using ZEX is make clear as well as how to use the four error 
handlers.   Also  packed with details on how to install and use Z3...get  your 
personal copy now!  Still only $19.95, plus shipping and handling.  We offer a 
25% discount to those buying 5-49, 33% for 50-249, and 40% over 249.  Shipping 
from stock!   Call 415/948-3820 to order with Visa or Mastercard,  or for UPS-
COD.

Paradox?    Farsightedness  and  living  in  the-now  go  together,   is   not 
paradoxical.   Planning  is a now (present) function.   Using what's available 
presently  (created by past thoughts and doings) produces future  environment. 
Detroit  auto-industry  started with fuel-efficient four-cylinder  engines  to 
power their cars,  moved to V-8's,  and now has returned to four's.   Are  you 
going  along with crowds and popular movements?   Are you  learning,  becoming 
what  you could be?   Are you creating your efficient environment in spite  of 
contrary  trends?   (Tried  California white Zinfandel?)  When will  resource-
conserving  8-bit  systems  using assembly language  coding  gain  popularity? 
IT'S_UP_TO_YOU!   Turbo-four  or V-8,  the same job gets  done;  but,  one  is 
substantially  more  efficient,  less brutish,  more sapient.   Homo  sapiens, 
become thrice sapient!  See you down the lines...
