   EXTENDED CMDRUN PROCESSING VIA AN ALIAS AND FLOW CONTROL--5/14/85
   -----------------------------------------------------------------
   ALIAS, Version 1.1
    Alias Name: CMDRUN
    Old Alias Command Line:
     1 --> IF EX A0:$1.ZEX;      |I keep ZEX files on A0:       
     2 --> ZEX $*;               |invoke ZEX with full command tail        
     3 --> ELSE;                 |no ZEX file?                  
     4 --> LRUN $*;              |try COMMAND.LBR for a COM file..
     5 --> FI                    | ..with full command tail.
   -----------------------------------------------------------------

"Above ALIAS script is an extension of the ZCPR3 CMDRUN processor.   It allows 
both  ZEX  and  LRUN  (LRUN22 or LRUNZ302) to act  as  dual  extended  command 
processors through the use of parameter passing and ZCPR3 Flow Commands.  When 
I  first attempted something of this sort,  it provoked some strange responses 
from some of the COM files in COMMAND.LBR,  so I gave up on the idea.   Then I 
saw  a  rather simplified version of the concept in a note  by  Dreas  Nielsen 
(Corvallis,  OR)  on  Norman Beeler's Zee-Machine (Sunnyvale,  CA) Z-Node  35, 
408/245-1420.   Dreas said something like 'use as many parameters as you want' 
and then it hit me:  why use individual parameters at all, except to check for 
the  existence  of  a  ZEX file?   Apparently,  an  ALIAS  file  passes  empty 
parameters, in some cases, as ASCII spaces (20h) and some programs are written 
to  respond to any character as a passed parameter.   By using the ALIAS  '$*' 
parameter  (thank  you,  Rick  Conn!)  we can make  sure  that  only  existing 
parameters  are passed and solve the problem.   ZEX is much more  tolerant  of 
being  passed 'spacey' parameters,  but '$*' is more elegant there  too.   I'd 
like  to see alternate CMDRUNs implemented in ZCPR3 itself--this approach is a 
bit  slow for my floppy-based system,  but will have to do for now--you  lucky 
hard  disk  owners  will probably hardly notice the  25%  speed  penalty  when 
compared to LRUN22 or ZEX used alone as CMDRUN.COM."
     For  your information,  Bruce conducts an advanced-user column in  User's 
Guide  magazine,  started Issue #15.   Writings come from one who  understands 
what  he writes about.   What an oddity!   Half #15 article is ZCPR3  related, 
about Get-Poke-Go,  other aliases,  etc.   Subscriptions to UG are obtained by

     Al Dunsmuir presently updates VMENU--we can't wait,  just as we  couldn't 
for his update of VFILER.   Next he works on MENU, VMENU, MENUCK, VMENUCK, and 
again VFILER.
     Jay Sage,  Joe Wright,  et al, have already worked over MENU into Version 
3.7.  New version loads only once as a shell (like VFILER 3.5), doesn't reload 
going from menu-display to menu-display (all for greatly increased operational 
quickness),  recognizes  QUIET flag and has all reported bugs removed.   Using 
MENU37 with DEMO.MNU is a joy.
     Rick Conn has checked out (from Z-Node Central) SYSLIB3,  VLIB, and Z3LIB 
to  expand their capabilities;  should finish in a month.   But what with  him 
also  working  simultaneously on Term3 cleanup and on  ZCPR3:   The  Libraries 
book,  we wonder;  a month?.  By the way, Rick's new SAK, the one that cancels 
ZEX with ^C, is out.  Look for it on Z-Nodes.

More on Quadram S-100 Boards:  Set consists of two IEEE /696 boards, 1) single 
board computer and 2) graphics board--Valiant is name to be given  board-pair! 
Very  appropriate,  "courageous"  and "valuable."  SBC contains new  AMD  9580 
combined  hard  and floppy (auto-select between 5.25" and 8") disk  controller 
chip  along  with AMD 9581 data separator,  and  of  course,  Hitachi  HD64180 
microprocessor.   From  what we've seen,  HD64180 makes Intel 80186 chip  look 
weak.   Furthermore,  we  understand HD64180 has built-in (hidden) circuits to 
on-chip  manage  RAM to one megabyte,  same as 8088,  8086  and  80186!   Such 
circuits will likely be made operative if demand requires it.
     Get  ready for real graphics quality from this Quadram  duo.   Initially, 
resolution  offered  is  up to 2,048 horizontal (columns)  by  1,024  vertical 
(rows,  scan  lines)  pixels,  with 256-color palette out  of  possible  1,024 
palettes:   262,144  total color possibilities!   Graphics board uses Motorola 
68020 as co-processor,  Hitachi HD63484 CRT graphics controller,  and up to  2 
megabytes of RAM (using 8419 DRAM controller), all dedicated to graphics.  NEC 
7220 GDC chip simply can't compare in performance to later-design HD63484.
     Time-of-day stamp is built into SBC hardware and BIOS.  OS runs near top-
of-RAM using less than 20k-bytes, with applications allowed remainder of 512k-
bytes.  Z-News 204 has more about these S-100 boards.

Z-Node 11 of Voorhees,  NJ needs more callers.  Mike Ward, Sysop, is "dying on 
the vine" for lack of callers who want ZCPR3 information.  His system has been 
fully  operational  for  two  months--he's ready to  handle  your  calls.   We 
recently scanned his system and thought it super!   Mike's 300/1200 bps  modem 
auto-answers,  followed  by friendly prompts;  it all happens only if you dial 
609/428-8864.
     Mid-Floridian's are proud of Z-Node 29 run by Sysop Ed  Unrein.   Compare 
his  board to Apple and IBM boards in geographical area.   We think 8-bit  has 
edge using Z-System with Z-Msg software.  Ed's number is 305/295-0844.  Let us 
know what you think!
     Please note Z-Node 10's location:   El Toro,  CA 92630, in Orange County. 
Sysop  Rea Williams has had too many calls from the north thinking he was  Los 
Angeles County.  His node number hasn't changed, is still 714/855-0672.
     Coming online soon:  Z-Node 37.  Marvin Eyre - Robards, KY 42452.

Amateur Z User's Corner:  Some utility programs permit use of ^P (send console 
to  printer,  both  from keyboard and going to screen) and some  don't.   Only 
those  that  use  BDOS function calls 1 and 2,  for  characters  to  and  from 
console,  do.   Many  Z3 utilities use direct BIOS jump table calls to by-pass 
console  ^S  and  ^C  intercept  functions,  automatically  provided  by  BDOS 
functions 1 and 2.   Many times these intercepts are not desired for  security 
reasons.
     Speed Tip Reminder:  It's worthwhile to specially prepare a "system" disk 
from  which  you normally cold boot.   Newsletter 008,  page 1,  paragraph  2, 
outlines  a technique for placing first used files near outer tracks of  disks 
for quick boot time access:   copy STARTUP,  LDR,  SYS.*,  QUIET, WHEEL, PATH, 
VFILER,  MENU,  your  editor/wordprocessor,  in  that  order  onto  a  freshly
formatted  diskette.   Thus  disk  drive  doesn't  go  through  time-consuming 
read/write head seeks to get to tracks containing needed data.  Cold boot time 
can be cut in half from randomly constructed system disks.
     After you've downloaded a typical Z-Node squeezed library file, suggested 
procedure:   use NULU placed along search path with LBR file on default  disk. 
The  command line to use is "NULU -o fn -e *.*" which extracts all files  from 
library file named "fn."  Use VFILER35 to unsqueeze all squeezed files.  Files 
that  have type OBJ should then be renamed to COM.   Next install the new  COM 
files  to your Z3 environment using "Z3INS A15:SYS fn.COM" command where fn is 
name of com file to be installed.   A VFILER CMD file with a numbered  command 
might  be "8z3ins a15:sys %n.com" to auto-install any Z utility with a  single 
keystroke (use Z3INS Version 1.3 only).   Move VFILER file pointer to COM file 
to  install  and  then press numbered command used by CMD  file,  8  for  this 
example.   Bingo!   COM  file  is  installed to your SYS.ENV file  located  in 
directory A15:ROOT.   (Z3INS uses information in SYS.EMV and places it in  COM 
file  being installed.)  COM file is on default disk,  VFILER is in A15:,  you 
work from, say B0:WORK1 directory.
    Program HELP is not a shell,  but can be made into one by using SHSET.COM. 
SHSET  makes a shell of any application program,  including aliases.   A  neat 
alias  might  be  "SHSET  HLP" with HLP being renamed from  HELP  for  use  as 
discussed  in Z-News 109 and used in DEMO.LBR.   Making renamed HELP  a  shell 
stops  it from returning to Z3 command line if a requested file of type HLP is 
not found.
     Using  ZAS  with ZCON to convert and assemble ZCPR3 source code  is  easy 
once  techniques to recover from minor syntax problems  are  discovered.   Run 
"ZCON fn.ft" to convert from Intel mnemonics to Zilog.   File generated is Z80 
file  type,  which is default for ZAS.   Run "ZAS fn" and notice any  assembly 
errors.   Write  down the first error code line and study what could be wrong. 
From  detailed knowledge of the ZAS manual,  any unacceptable form  or  syntax 
should  be  changed with your editor.   Change the Z80 converted source  file. 
Re-assembly,  re-edit,  until there are no assembly errors.  Then link or load 
to create COM type file, ready to execute.
     Only problems we are aware of are the .8080 and .z80 pseudo-op lines in a 
few  files that permit either Intel or Zilog processors to be  used.   Comment 
these  out,  putting a semicolon in column one of lines containing  them.   As 
time  goes  by,  we  will change all programs on  our  distribution  disks  to 
Zilog/Hitachi   mnemonics,   as  we  move  away  from  8080's  into  full  Z80 
instructions, plus extensions used by HD64180/Z800 high-integration chips.

Z-News  Anniversary Nears!  We wish there were a birthday cake big  enough  to 
offer a slice to each Echelon customer, those in every state of the Union, all 
Canadian provinces,  and a dozen countries abroad;  but there isn't!   So what 
about  a  gift  of "price reduction" on some software  products?   You'll  see 
reductions soon--before 23 July, mast-head date of first issue of newsletter.
     Our  minds  leap laughingly ahead of our  software  project  completions, 
knowing we do what we do not for money but for the sheer love of it!

Thoughts  on  Artificial Intelligence:  While many expect intelligent  systems 
just around corner, we thought of programming one of our machines with ability 
to handle selectively these simple business management requirements:   1) take 
action,  don't tell us what was done;  2) take action but do tell;  3) explore 
possibilities  of  the situation and tell us what is planned to  be  done,  if 
anything;  4) look into situation and outline tactics, strategies to deal with 
it and recommend one for our approval;  and finally, 5) research the condition 
or  problem,  give  us all pertinent facts and wait for us to take  action  or 
until  we state (by keyboard entry) what should be done.   Remember,  we  deal 
with conditions, but solve problems.  Think of the inference!
     Oh! Mighty Man, we have much stone to lift before magically turning water 
into wine,  before understanding power,  before designing our aggregate wisdom 
into our machines.  We humans have power to act, write, speak without thought, 
being no more than 20% conscious of what we're doing (most animation caused by 
subconscious energy)!   Presently,  our machine designs are not too  different 
from  what we imagine ourselves to be.   Soon they get better,  but only as we 
get better.  Now that's Life!
