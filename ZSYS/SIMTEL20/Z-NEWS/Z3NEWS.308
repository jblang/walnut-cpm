     Bruce Morgen,  erstwhile computer editor for Electronic Products magazine 
and  present  User's Guide Advanced User  columnist,  places  newsletter  yoke 
around  neck...his  NAOG  (North American One-Eighty Group)  signals  bend  in 
road...eight-bit computing systems shall never die!   Those of bigger/more-is-
better mentality cannot not stop us...deep-living alone wares well.  (No-think 
leads  to vegetable-like sleep,  plight of some popular magazine editors  with 
neither   focus  nor  long-sightedness.)   Whoopee!    Subscription  to   NAOG 
newsletter costs $15.00 per year,  12 issues.  To order:  write NAOG, P.O. Box 
2781,  Warminster,  PA  18974,  or call 215/443-9031.   It's a must if you own 
Hitachi HD64180 8-bit computer,  either S-100 or SBC.   Others, especially PC-
DOS  users,  wouldn't  find  NAOG  interesting unless  they  are  thinking  of 
upgrading...

ZCPR3  Game.    The first game available,  to our  knowledge,  using  full  Z3 
environment  (doesn't  run under CP/M) is called THELLO,  is being offered  by 
Tiger Computing,  8372 Morris Road,  Hilliard,  OH 43026.   It's  interactive, 
between one player and computer or between two players, with goal of acquiring 
more  blocks  of  space  (pieces) than  opponent.   Three  levels-of-play  are 
selectively  provided.   You gain as opponent loses--lots of dramatic  who-is-
ahead  reversals  as  game progresses.   Program makes  use  of  screen  half-
intensity, cursor positioning, and 8-bit computer speed.  Very impressive!
     Demonstration  of  game  playing  against itself is on  Z-Nodes  in  file 
THELLDEM.LBR.   Simply download,  install as Z3 utility using Z3INS, and enjoy 
some of what can be--then, for fun, order your fully playable copy.  Presently 
supplied only on 8" SSSD disk,  THELLO costs a mere $10.00 plus $3.00 shipping 
and handling from TC.

Z  TIPS.    Creating a complex,  long macro (multiple) command-line  alias  is 
quick  and  easy if correct tools are available.   Z-System  has  such  tools. 
First, load VERROR (or ERROR23) followed by HSH (or VCED), then run BALIAS (or 
VALIAS)  under HSH.   Next,  key-in your long set of commands,  editing as you 
observe  typos.   Execute  the  alias from  within  HSH;  VERROR  notifies  of 
unexecutable  commands.   Alter  command  text on-the-fly from  within  VERROR 
noting changes that work.  Last, re-execute, modify until each command, entire 
alias,  runs  as intended.   Wow!   Of course,  same technique may be used  to 
develop ZEX batch command files,  or ARUNZ ALIAS.CMD files.   We challenge PC-
DOS and Unix users to compete in such interactive automation feats.
     Command  error handling,  full-screen multiple command-line editing  with 
present  and  previous  command  recalling  (up  to  the  last  100   commands 
executed!),  full-screen  creation  of  aliases consisting of  alias  nesting, 
multiple   commands  with  extensive  variable  passing,   including   current 
directory.   Again,  wow!  Yet, many magazine editors claim, fugue-like, there 
is  nothing new to report from 8-bit microcomputing world--we WONDER why  they 
think such non-sense.
     Our  Z-Node network is estimated to be handling over 35,000  callers  per 
month.   We  get words out about what we are doing,  notwithstanding a popular 
press inclined to ignore our community.   Day soon comes when high-performance 
8-bit systems are publicly proclaimed for usefulness, speed, and efficiency.

We_Get_Letters.   Newsletters 006 and 301 discussed machine resources required 
to support Z-System.   Some few of you seem to think we think Z cannot be used 
on systems smaller than a pair of 360k-byte floppy drives.   Not  true!   More 
power to those who arrange their resources to use but two 191k-byte drives and 
still get their work done.  Bravo!  We are fully aware of performance provided 
by  big RAM and fast hard disk drives;  but these devices are not necessary to 
gain  substantial increased-productivity benefits from using  Z-System.   Many 
ways to open oysters...we salute diversity of thought,  which always leads  to 
improved  technique.   You  know we stand against trooping (see Zeffirelli  in 
304).   Daniel  Brogan,  a professional writer,  tells how he  uses  191k-byte 
drives, in file Z-ON-A-2.TXT on Z-Nodes everywhere.

Z-Node Activity.   Welcome to Z-Node #45 and its sysop, Richard "Ken" Reid, in 
Houston, TX.  Dick's Altos computer modem number is 713/937-8886.  He fills Z-
System need in the great southwestern section of USA,  reducing load on our El 
Paso nodes.
     Z-node #41's modem number is 301/254-6277.   Its sysop,  Larry Mansfield, 
in Baltimore,  handles traffic at one end of Maryland, while John D'Ausilio in 
Bladensburg handles other end, 301/779-7986.  State is covered! 

Amateur  Z User's Corner.   Object code and source (ASCII) code are  different 
according to purpose.   Object code uses the full 8-bits of a byte,  needed to 
control  computer's processing unit registers.   Assembler mnemonics (ASCII 7-
                  bit)  are converted (language translated) to machine  opera-
                  tion code for register manipulation, getting the work done.
                       A  word  processor or editor program  usually  produces 
                  ASCII  7-bit code,  except for programs like  WordStar  that 
                  uses  the  8th  bit (MSB,  most significant bit)  for  soft-
                  hyphen, etc., indication.
                       A  runnable program is one that's been  converted  from 
                  lines  of text (statements) produced by you and your  editor 
                  to object code by an assembler or compiler.
                       Programs MENU,  VMENU,  ARUNZ,  and VFILER process text 
                  files  for computer task automation.   You create MNU,  VMN, 
                  and CMD files with your editor.   Chapters 5 and 7 of ZCPR3: 
                  The  Manual describes the elements necessary to  learn  menu 
                  and command file creation.
                                            The   Manual   has  an   excellent 
                                       Appendix   with  a  glossary  of   word 
                                       meanings.   Learning from this glossary 
Lewis Carroll sketch                   increases  your  understanding.    Word 
   "Pray, your Majesty, let our        meaning is important--it's the only way 
     teacher quickly appear as         we have to communicate with you.   Word 
      as we need him."                 clarity   leads  to  phrase  and   idea 
                                       clarity.  Clarity leads to abstraction.  
                                       For  without abstraction we are  unable 
                                       to  understand things  and  communicate 
                                       complex thoughts.
                       Now to the SHOW utility...it shows important  addresses 
                  and status of your system.   Page 86 of The Manual describes 
                  much  of  what  you  need to  know  about  SHOW.   The  base 
                  addresses of all segment packages (RCP, FCP, ENV, NDR, etc.) 
                  and  buffers  are displayed.   Completely  menu  driven,  11 
                  screens  tell of message status (error,  ZEX,  etc.),  shell 
                  stack  condition,   named  directories,  paths,  full-screen 
                  memory content reporting, system file names, CRT and printer 
                  data.   Everything you wish to know about your running ZCPR3 
                  system is available from one of SHOW's menus.   A  correctly 
                  running SHOW is a good indication,  in addition to providing 
                  so much information,  that your entire Z-System is installed 
                  correctly.   Don't forget, SHOW can be installed as an error 
                  handler, useful during system debugging.

Z-MSG Message Handling Program greatly expanded by author, Tim Gary, but keeps 
compact size (only 26k-bytes).  Newsletter 009 has our last words about Z-Msg. 
Version 1.31a handles all popular real-time clocks and does more; for example: 
   o  A  special  ZCPR3  ONLY addition allows the sysop of a ZCPR3  system  an 
extremely  flexible method of running other programs from Z-Msg command  mode. 
Any number of commands,  including parameters,  may be used for various  user-
type access setups.
   o  An  advanced  user  edit  command facility has  been  added  with  these 
features:
      . "Sweep/Disk7-like" operation allows System Operator (sysop) to quickly
        step through the users file, and edit, delete, or restore users.
      . Direct seek to specified user number, and search for user name.
      . Mass purge operation to delete users by selected criteria (times user
        has called, date last logged on, and user status).
      . Displaying and restoring users that have been deleted, as long as a
        new user hasn't taken the previous users "slot" in the users file.
   o  From  within  Z-Msg  and  with  sysop-status,   Control-P  (^P)  toggles 
operator's printer on and off.
   o  A  temporary  simulation  of half-duplex operation may be  performed  by 
using ^E (Control-E) to toggle the echoing of characters.   Normally,  message 
system  echos  characters  back as they are  typed;  this  control  turns  off 
automatic echo characteristic.   Feature offers long distance callers a method 
to  avoid most of the delay caused by time taken for characters to be sent and 
returned to their terminal.
   o  The APply command now automatically sets subject of message to something 
resembling "*** New User Application ***".
   o  Z-Msg  may execute a program before the user logs out from  the  message 
system.  Normally  control  is  passed to telephone  answer  program  (Term3's 
T3ANSWER  and  IOP or BYE) which disconnects to modem,  and prepares for  next 
call.
   o  When  editing a line of text while entering a message,  you may  specify 
rest-of-line  as deleted in replacement text by appending a "#" to  new  text. 
For example:   line 5 text is "Mary had a little lamb"; if line is edited with 
search string "little" and replacement string "big elephant#",  resulting line 
becomes "Mary had a big elephant".
   o  Greater  ability  to upload text,  like WordStar files,  exists  because 
message  system now strips (zeros) high-bit (bit 8) of byte  (character)  from 
typed  text  in more places than in previous  versions.   Also,  any  linefeed 
character  received is translated  into a space character.   Thus uploading  a 
message with embedded Carriage Return/Linefeed characters, in that order, need 
not have the first character in each blank line be a space.
   o  If a clock is installed,  the sysop may set a separate timeout value for 
each user type.  Value determines time duration a user stays on system, before 
being  auto-logged-off,  at Z-Msg command prompt.   The following  object-code 
routines are supplied and installed from a Z-Msg menu:

 MEC-5832.CLK - 5832 homebrew clock   MEC-LG2.CLK  - Kaypro 2 and Legacy clock 
 MEC-BBII.CLK - Big Board II          MEC-KPRO.CLK - Kaypro 2 and ProClock
 MEC-CW.CLK   - CompuTime/QT clock    MEC-QX10.CLK - Epson QX10
 MEC-KP4.CLK  - Kaypro 4 clock        MEC-XERO.CLK - Xerox 820-II clock
 MEC-LG10.CLK - Kaypro 10 and Legacy clock
 MEC-SS1.CLK  - CompuPro System Support 1 clock 
 MEC-KCT.CLK  - Kenmore Computer Technologies clock

Additional routines are possible using MECLKHDR.ASM file supplied, or with BYE 
3/5 clock insert files.
     Z-Msg  has become so significant in our software stable we cancelled EMSG 
development.   Z-Msg  takes  us through the 1980's to  Earth  satellite  relay 
packet networks.
     Z-Msg,  with  80-page  loose-leaf,  is  offered for  $99.95,  plus  $4.00 
shipping and handling.  Source code is an additional $100.00.  Manual alone is 
$20.00, refundable if program ordered later.



                                  Use of DRUGS

Learn,  know  physiological  results from taking hallucinogenic  and  narcotic 
drugs.   Drug abuse bares bitter fruits.   Any who want to argue about the so-
called beauty or harmlessness must awake and start thinking.  If drugs control 
you now, the habit pattern may be so powerful you will need outside assistance 
to break it, to find another way to get through the day.

How Hallucinogenic Drugs Work in the Brain
     Diagrams  below  are accurate representation of facts  disclosed  through 
micro-photography  within  a living human brain.   Photos  were  taken  during 
brain-cell  process  of transferring a sensory message from one brain cell  to 
another.   Cells  are directly related in chain from input to senses to  final 
action, thought, or decision made as a result of that input.

Diagram I
     In normal transfer of sensory signal from cell to cell,  after an initial 
electrical  impulse,  the brain cells do not actually touch;  transmission  is 
accomplished by tiny,  tiny grains of protein,  called "transmitter granules", 
which cross tiny gap between the two nerve cell endings.   If,  for  instance, 
this particular signal is part of a shade of green (hundreds or even thousands 
of cells would be involved in ascertaining a tree's shades of leaf color), the 
granules  cross gap between correct nerve endings and transmit that  specific, 
correct  shade  of  green  for  which  they  were  biologically,   genetically 
programmed (through heritage).

Diagram II
     Under  influence  of hallucinogenic or  "mind-manifesting"  drugs,  these 
transmitter  granules  are physically disrupted,  broken up into  hundreds  or 
thousands  of  bits  and  pieces.   They  then scatter  all  over  the  brain, 
indiscriminately  hitting unrelated brain cells.   Sensation of green  may  be 
mixed with some red.  Bits may hit a cell end transferring impulses of "up" or 
"down" or danger,  joy,  pain, guilt, anger, and may hit possible subconscious 
fantasies of murder, great powers, suicide, and so on.

What seems to the drug-user as a "high" is really an all-time low, in terms of 
correct,  reality-oriented,  significant  information.   And that can lead  to 
incorrect  thoughts,   feelings,   judgments,  and  irrational  decisions  and 
actions--and non-action when action is indicated.

This  is  the  danger  of drug-abuse:  FEELING AND  REACTING  TO  NON-REALITY!
Love and relationships cannot grow and mature between/among people  influenced 
by drugs.   Alcohol, marijuana, cocaine, LSD, PCP, and heroin.  Drugs, a cause 
for battering among family members,  marital divorces, and broken friendships. 
Think straight.  Rise up!  and become what you are capable of becoming.

Industry  Brief.   Toshiba produces CMOS exact-replacement for NMOS Z80  chip. 
Dissipates  but 60 milliwatts at 4 megaHertz clock rate,  compared to  over-a-
watt for conventional Z80.   Mostek,  Z80 supplier owned by United Technology, 
doors closed.   Z80 without Mostek and its superior documentation and customer 
support would never have become so popular;  but now it's gone.   Can  western 
companies compete with Oriental?
     Japan's  industry  (attention  to detail)  fast  overtakes  USA's.   Such 
industry  forces Detroit to improve their offerings--Detroit has some ways  to 
go!   Reason we buy Japanese imports is same reason they wouldn't buy ours, no 
matter how fair and easy the marketing channels.  Ignore scape-goats, increase 
value.

Ramblings.    (Still  camped  on mountain top,  positioned  among  plants  and 
animals, co-inhabitants of Earth.)  Creatures of habit, appetite, consumption, 
re-action,  we continue to be;  business as usual, as we lose our economy, our 
mental  and  moral advantages.  Take a longer view,  or become a second  class 
culture or perhaps worse,  extinct.   Our enormous abdomens betray us--tell of 
our true worship.  Or are we addicted to generating internal endorphins?
     There's  an  infinite number of levels of drunkenness,  ranging  from  an 
overdose of beauty to an overdose of alcohol or heroin.   (Yes,  beauty causes 
us to linger,  is a major stumbling block to learning,  to becoming.)  We  are 
without  much  fancy  or imagination--we lust  for  satisfaction,  fulfillment 
without working for it.
     Listen,  there  is no second-party salvation;  it's up to you to make  of 
what's available,  to turn substance into finer essence.   There is no  heaven 
but  what's in your mind.   Heaven is not a place;  it's a dimension added  to 
your  understanding  (see end of Z-News 304).   The shell game  is  over--life 
starts and stops with you and me.
     You may have heard it said "plagiarism is basic to culture, any culture." 
We  each  use  to advantage things past.   But,  we must pay for such  use  by 
creating things of equal value others can use.   Such accounting adds to  Life 
instead of death, promotes local Construction (that echoes throughout Cosmos), 
not destruction.
     What  constitutes the Whole (question asked in 307,  pg  5)?   Integrity. 
How  can any one be weak,  false who dares to_be at all?   Even tender  plants 
force their way up through hard soil, and crevices of highway asphalt; surely, 
a human being, no material substance can resist.  What a wedge, a force, Third 
Force,  is an earnest person!  Can he be resisted?  The heavens are as deep as 
our aspirations are high.  So high as a tree aspires to grow, so high it finds 
an  environment  to nurture,  to nourish it.   Is there one who dares not  see 
clearly beyond, though only a hair's breadth beyond where he currently stands? 
Z-System users, dare!
