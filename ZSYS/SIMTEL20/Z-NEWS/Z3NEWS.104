Z  TIPS:   VFILER is an important ZCPR3 shell.   Running your entire  computer 
system from its CMD files is easy.  At cold boot your startup alias is used to 
load  VFILER as the last operation,  turning control over to  you,  ending  in 
splendid DIRectory screen of VFILER.   From there you have access to ten macro 
commands  for further operations.   If you move to another directory,  another 
ten could be available.
     Housekeeping is VFILER's strength.   Fully screen oriented,  can point to 
files to further process them:   tag for group copy to another directory,  for 
deletion  as  a  group,  with or without  individual  verification  prompting; 
rename,  size,  view (if text file) or send to printer.  You may organize your 
system from CMD macro menus,  VFILER's secondary strength.   Housekeeping plus 
command menus tie your activities together.   If you design CMD's to  automate 
normal  tasks,  your overall efficiency is greatly improved:  through  reduced 
keyboard  inputs,  less typing,  thus fewer typing errors;  and reduced mental 
(mnemonic) overhead!
     An example CMD command and menu file:

  ! Vfiler CMD File for Word Processing, Database and Communicatins
  !reminder --> %d=current disk  %u=current user  %f=current file
  !         --> %$=%d%u:%f

     Note leading ! starts comment line (any character other than a number  or 
#  can also);  the # means end-of-commands,  start of menu displayed when # is 
pressed  by  console operator.   Looking at Command  6:   T/MAKER3  integrated 
multi-purpose  program  loads  which  then  loads  (get)  special  text   file 
FINANCE.TMK  and goes into edit mode (e);  after editing is complete and  exit 
occurs,  ZRDOS  COPY  program  loads and automatically archives text  file  to 
directory BACKUP,  normally disk C0 on Echelon's corporate computer.   BASE is 
always A0;  B0,  WORK1;  and A8 is CAT (A8 is not along COM file path  seach). 
Commands 2,  3 and 4 use Wayne Holder's (Oasis Systems, San Diego, California) 
The WORD Plus and Punctuation and Style.

     Command  structure and syntax come from VFILER online help at menu  entry 
(creating)  User Functions (0-9 and #).   You learn to use VFILER from  within 
itself.   VFILER  has  full  CRT screen of instant,  built-in  help  (menu  of 
available commands) obtained by typing ? (or /) at command prompt, but it also 
has  H  for  chaining to VFILER.HLP  A search is first make to  find  HELP.COM 
along the path; if not found, running HLP is not attempted.  Don't forget that 
aliases  (created  with  ALIAS.COM)  can  be  nested  in  CMD  command  lines.  
Extensive  ALIAS variables are sometimes convenient (and fun)  to  use.   Also 
MENU and VMENU may be an entry in a CMD command line!  If you don't use VFILER 
you  are  missing advantages of a powerful shell--Unix (and  PC/MS-DOS)  users 
wished they had it so good!

Two  neat  files  on our Z-Nodes are WMPATCH and WSPATCH,  written  by  Dennis 
Wright,  used  to permit WordMaster and WordStar to know about ZCPR3  and  its 
TCAP  evironment.   Give  them a try from either 213/670-9465 or  415/489-9005 
message systems.

Good_News:  Crescendo Systems (Dave Lucky,  1030 Santa Lucia  Drive,  Pleasant 
Hill,   CA  94523,  415/827-9339)  is  shipping  ready-to-run  ZCPR3  for  SWP 
Microcomputer  Products'  ATR8000 series.   Implementation comes with  30-page 
COOKBOOK  telling of ZCPR3 virtures and ways to arrange your disk  system  for 
best efficiency.  If you own an ATR8000, or want to buy one, and want ZCPR3 on 
it, Crescendo is the way to upgrade for only $124.95, complete.
     ZCPR3:  The Manual is going to be shipped.  We can't say for sure but the 
rumor  is in early March all orders go out!   What a relief and a blessing  it 
will be to have it out!  Into hands of all those who want it!  Richard Conn is 
reviewing  final  page  proofs now.   Those having placed  orders  receive  it 
through  the  mail,  without further contact.   Once we get our hands on  this 
beautiful document we will forget all the delays and be happy.
     ZRDOS2  appears on schedule,  and if nothing unplanned occurs will  start 
delivery at end of February.  Our flyer on it and ZRDOS is informative.
     Ampro Computers (67 E.  Evelyn Avenue,  Mountain View, CA 94041, 915/962-
0230)  is  shipping  their  SCSI  (Small  Computer  Systems  Interface  - ANSI 
Standard)  add-on board to Little Boardtm and costs $99.00 plus S&H.   We  use 
this interface on Dave McCord's Z-Node at 415/489-9005.   If you haven't  been 
accessing  our  node you've been missing use of a unique set of fast  hardware 
and software.
     An aside:  the Echelon team is working presently to complete our  planned 
nodal  activity,  hopefully by September 1985.   Z-Node runs secure ZCPR3  and 
ZRDOS  (or Z-Com) with Term3 and Emsg.   All tie together through use of Term3 
to form automatic global (Earthly) message handling system.  Sysops wishing to 
convert to such a communications system please write for further details.

Sort_of_Bad_News:   Zilog  has  slipped first deliveries  of  Z800  into  next 
quarter missing promised Valentine's Day introduction--as declared some months 
back--being  the tenth anniversary of their founding.   The only good side  of 
this announcement is they also delayed introduction of top-of-the-line Z80,000 
the same amount.   When or how will fire be put under them is unknown.   So we 
wait  for  this  beautiful  Z80 upward compatible chip,  and  wait  and  wait!
Remember  it  will run our software without change.   And do it with 3  to  10 
times  speed  of  a 4-mHz Z80!   Its instruction set  contains  8080  and  Z80 
operation  codes,  plus many more for hardware arithmetic and 16-megabyte  RAM 
control   for   efficient  multitasking,   running  more  than   one   program 
simultaneously.

REACTIONS:   We  opened  a  hornets' nest when  we  didn't  indicate  expected 
delivery dates for our new prdoucts,  as included on List Prices sheet dated 7 
January 1985.   Our new sheet (being printed now) indicate status of each line 
item.   A  general  summary  indicates all new items are shipping or  will  be 
within  60 days or less.   The exceptions are  ZRDOS3,  Emsg,  Change  Control 
Manager (MaintMan) and ZCPR3:  The Libraries.  More dates when they firm.
     Question regarding our Lasting-Value Software has been received.  What is 
it?   We've  never been too clear about the label...the line consists only  of 
those  application  programs that either impress or take full advantage of  Z-
System environment.  Presently we consider these few under our definition:

                    Discat -- File and Disk Catalog Manager
                 XtraKey -- Stand-alone Function-key Generator
                  KAMAS -- Integrated Idea/Outline Processor
               Term3 -- Terminal/Computer Communications Program
                   MaintMan -- Document Maintenance Manager
                  Emsg -- Electronic Message and Mail Handler

KAMAS  and  XtraKey are provided by Compusophic Systems  and  Xpert  Software, 
respectively (see newsletters 007 and 009); the rest, Echelon.  All other than 
these  programs provided by Echelon are considered "core" packages--those that 
put you into high-technology computing with ZCPR3 and its utilities and  ZRDOS 
modules (Z-System)!  Remaining software, not part of core or applications, are 
program  development  tools (Z-Toolstm) consisting of  assemblers,  debuggers, 
translators,  disassembler,  and  Syslib3.   These aid in quickly writing  and 
debugging assembly language programs, even without source code.
     Z-Tools,  along with ZCPR3 utilities,  permit efficient creation of  end-
user  solutions...end-users are those who don't buy tools;  they buy solutions 
to their problems.   Syslib3,  VFILER,  MENU,  VMENU,  ALIAS,  PWD, SAK, Named 
Directories,  all real turn-key system producers!   Programmers, learn and not 
forget:   end-users are wind in our sails--they blow,  we go!   End-users  are 
everywhere; one could be you.
     Why Z?   What a name for an operating system and its environment!   Well, 
it's  the last letter in the alphabet;  it's associated with Zilog,  source of 
our chips.   And it's fresh and easy to remember,  compared to cob-webbed Unix 
and the like.

Amateur's Corner:    Learning   assembly  language  programming   is   greatly 
simplified  with debuggers and disassemblers of quality  we  offer.   Example: 
disassemble  a COM file for a program you have source code to and then compare 
source listings.   Re-assemble disassembled source, modify by editing until no 
assembly errors occur--learning by doing!   Our ASM and MAC (with  subroutines 
coming from Syslib3) files are ideal to use as source.   See how the REL files 
were  linked  into contiguous binary code groupings and then from whence  they 
came.  Disassembling code is fun and informative and teaches programming fast.
We encourge all to consider value of our Z-Tools package,  both as  production 
software and as information bearers!

You've  probably  noticed bias in ways we approach computer usage:   we  don't 
patronize  the naive user;  he is given a chance to grow,  to learn to  be  an 
elitist!  We prod and push ourselves to learn, as we do with you.
     Some  say you don't need to know how something works to use it,  but such 
concepts result in parallel philosophy:   one doesn't need to understand  life 
to live--not true!   To live (and not be simply a product of reaction, to have 
a personal will) requires deep understanding of life.  Using a computer is one 
thing--understanding  its  logical  operations is something  quite  different.
That difference makes difference.   Both sheep and wolf within us must  remain 
intact!

See you down the lines...

                ==============================================


                                                                   [zrdos2.ei]

                               Z  R  D  O  S  2

ZRDOS2 is extended over ZRDOS for enhanced buffered command line editing,  big 
hard disk usage and improved ZCPR3 I/O Package interfaces.   Planned shipments 
start 28 February 1985.   Those who would like to upgrade to a super Z80 coded 
BDOS  and no longer be dependent upon Digital Research can now be fully  free.
(Requires BIOS buffer space of 304 bytes.)  ZCPR3 combined with ZRDOS2  create 
super system.
     Additionally,  we offer a complete set of software development system (Z-
Tooltm) utilities:   relocating Z80 macro assembler,  linker, library manager,
two  debuggers,  five  trans-lators  (to  and  from  Intel/Zilog/TDL/CDL)  and
8080/Z80 disassemblers.  Some important ZRDOS2 features:

          Downward compatible with CP/M-80, full ZCPR3 compatibility    
     Takes advantage of Z80 Instruction Set with single-level re-entrance
  ZCPR3 Wheel Byte used to write-protect selected files from non-Wheel users
                   Handles files and disks to 512 megabytes
                 Changed floppy disks automatically logged in
               Read/Only Disk status maintained after warm boot
  Read Console Buffer Function (10) has full edit and recall capability plus
                    treats rubout (DEL) same as backspace      
File Archive Attribute Bit set by Function 30, compatible with MP/M and CP/M 3
 Support Utilities include A(rchive)C(opy), useful for archiving and backup, 
plus Set/Display File Attribute, View, Compare, and Dump programs
     Enhanced Error Messages with non-cryptic announcements          
Extended Functions (47, 50 & 52) get DMA and set/reset warm boot trap
Z800 version (ZRDOS3) has over 47 non-CP/M Functions added to achieve
                  easy MS-DOS program migration       
 Z80 version in hex code to patch existing CP/M system @ $74.99
            Z800 version pricing not yet established            

Function  10  enhanced with full insert edit capability,  plus command  recall 
from buffer area,   add new convenience with ZCPR3 multiple commands per line. 
Documentation is 45 pages of tight,  unambiguous language describing each  DOS 
function.   We are only handling ZRDOS2 on 8" SSSD disks at present; if demand 
is high for other formats we will download.
   The  Z80 development system Z-Tool Package is $200.00 complete;  the  super 
mainframe-featured  screen  oriented dynamic assembly language  debugger  adds 
$195.00.   Again, Z800 version pricing not yet established.
