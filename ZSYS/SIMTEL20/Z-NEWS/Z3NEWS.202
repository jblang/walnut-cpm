Z  TIPS:   Eagerly awaiting completion of VFILER Version 3.5,  upgrade  by  Al 
Dunsmuir  (Scarborough,  Ontario,  Canada),  we submit here what we think  are 
useful  VFILER  notes.   But  first,  we show VFILER built-in  help  (menu  of 
commands using screen highlighting),  obtained by typing "?" or "/" (unshifted 
?)  toggle at VFILER Files display command prompt.   Last of three displays is 
Macro Menu (VFILER.CMD file).

 Command (? = Files): X

When  in Files display,  command line shows as:   Command (?  =  Help):.   The 
drive/user  area (directory name) is shown in upper left corner;  current-file 
cursor  points to,  at upper right.   Commands may be executed from three  (3) 
user interface displays:   files, built-in help and macro menus.  Current File 
shows from all displays, even Macro Menu.
     Instead of 6 or 7 seconds, VFILER 3.5 loads in about 3 seconds (thanks to 
Z-Noder  Jay Sage,  Newton Centre,  MA),  using 8" DSDD drives,  indicating  a 
really useful,  little noticed utility.   Observe internal macro command  menu 
(User  Functions) is obtained by typing "#",  fully releaving any necessity to 
remember the ten (10) custom commands.
     VFILER  does  things  you want it to do:   unsqueeze  files  to  printer, 
console  or  to  another file,  or unsqueeze on a wildcard  and  group  basis. 
Single or group tagging/untagging,  copying,  renaming, deleting, viewing, and 
paginated with-header printing.   Also wildcard tagging/untagging of files for 
further  processing--nothing is as quick and as simple as VFILER  for  general 
disk  and  file housekeeping,  and as macro-command main entry  into  turn-key 
menu/command-line drive computer system!
     Now  we  design  an example CMD macro command file (with Macro  Menu)  to 
manage  ZCPR3 source files,  by keeping them in a squeezed library called  (by 
Charles  McManis,  Sunnyvale,  CA)  SOURCES.   Z-News 201 showed  how  library 
automation is realized from ZCPR3 command line using aliases PUT,  GET, INSERT 
and EXRACT.  We use two of these in our design and VFILER current-file pointer 
to  insert/extract  files  into/from  SOURCES,  plus  additional  aliases  and 
commands assisting other activities.
     Remember, several CMD files may be used in your system by placing each in 
a  different  directory,  using current directory and search  path  to  access 
desired  one.   The command lines of CMD are separated from Macro Menu by  the 
"#"  symbol,  the  same  symbol used to  display  menu.   VFILER.HLP  contains 
information necessary to write custom CMD files.   While in VFILER,  type H to 
access  this  documentation;  outside,  use command HELP ZCPR3 with HLP  files 
along your path.

  ------------------------------------------------------------------
   0 - Directory of Current Disk                         (XDIR) - 0
   1 - EDIT Current File (non-document mode)         (WordStar) - 1

XDIR  is  set  here to give a display horizontally sorted by  file  name  (not 
vertically by file type,  the defaults for XDIR) of all files on current disk. 
Notice how trailing command attributes are easily added to CMD command text to 
bring out features desired.  Text between apostrophes (prompts to user) may be 
nested, to be answered by user, one following another!
     WordStar 3.0 is poked at location 392H (a byte altered) to make sure non-
document  mode is used for program source code editing function (no high  bit-
7's  set  that  way).   GO executes WS at standard  Z  (CP/M)  location  100H. 
Program file is pointed to with VFILER cursor arrow,  passed to WS as %f file. 
Your ZCPR3 CCP must be assembled to have GET and GO active.
     Library  program NULU (Martin Murray's replacement for LU and LSWEEP) has 
been renamed to LU.   PUTIT alias is:   sq $1;era $1;insert *.mqc.  INSERT and 
EXTRACT aliases are from Z-News 201;  sq is SQUEEZE program.   (We learned GET 
alias name conflicts with ZCPR3 resident,  intrinsic GET,  which loads a  file 
without   execution  at  a  specified  memory  location--JUMP  intrinsic  runs 
program.)
     Using 3 to extract a file from SOURCES library results in prompt for file 
name of MAC file desired.   Only file name is entered without file type.  File 
copy is automatically unsqueezed exiting SOURCES library,  details in  EXTRACT 
alias.
     Master disk and file catalog is scanned using Rick Conn's DISCAT (Echelon 
proprietary)  program (see Newsletter 008,  page 2).   Here's a case of shell-
menu controlled directory (CAT) being entered from shell VFILER.   The  DISCAT 
menu permits running VFILER and chaining back when finished.  Of course, going 
to  HELP directory from VFILER results in nested shells also.   Where does  it 
end--it doesn't!  Disk B0: is directory WORK1 (see Newsletter 104, page 1).
     Study  the newsletters and HLP files and your ability to create macro CMD 
files  increases quickly.   Try some--start slow and debug each  command  line 
before  going to the next--learn a little,  do,  learn more.   Aliases and Zex 
file  in  Z-News  109 and 201 set the mood!   (Next  newsletter  covers  Files 
display and adds more notes.)

Z-COM is big success!  Now you can install Z-System on your computer in a  few 
minutes, with I/O Package Segment ready to use PKey and other I/O packages you 
or we develop.  You have all the functions of full-up Z without modifying your 
BIOS.   Z-Com  cold  boots  as your operating system by using CP/M  CCP  patch 
technique  described in Newsletter 009,  but ZC is used as command instead  of 
Z3.
     Licensed users of Z3-Dot-Com may upgrade to Z-Com (with I/OP) for  $40.95 
plus  tax  (if  any)  and shipping and handling of  $3.00  (a  $99.00  value). 
Included  is rose-pink two-sided command and installation card,  two disks  of 
latest  ZCPR3 utilities,  along with six (6) special ZRDOS utilities and  full 
online  HLP  documentation.   Notice command 6 in above CMD  file,  how  auto-
archiving  (backup)  of edited (changed) file occurs using ZRDOS Archive  Copy 
utility!

Z-Node Network nears completion in United States--need several nodes in Europe 
and Asia.   These apparently won't come automatically to us, so we will search 
them out!

Z-Node #15 needs more callers!   Those  in  Chicago  area can have access to a
super Kaypro BBS and Z-Node run by Sysop Richard Jacobson.   Try it--dial 312/
649-1730 and behold treasures offered your modem port.

Amateur_Z_User's_Corner:   Where to go to efficiently obtain  more  knowledge, 
understanding  of computer operations and usage--try your public library!   We 
know our writings don't completely cover your needs, but there's lots of books 
and magazines we recommend reading and studying that will:

1. Soul of CP/M:  Using and Modifying CP/M's Internal Features, Mitchell Waite
2. The Programmer's CP/M Handbook, Andy Johnson-Laird, Osborne/McGraw-Hill
3. Inside CP/M, Dave Cortesi of Dr. Dobb's Journal
4. User's Guide, P.O. Box 5245, Redwood City, CA  94063, 415/364-0108
5. The Computer Journal, P.O. Box 1697, Kalispell, MT  59903, 406/257-9119
6. Micro Cornucopia, P.O. Box 223, Bend, OR,  97709, 503/382-5060
7. Micro/Systems Journal, P.O. Box 1192, Mountainside, NJ  07092, 201/522-9347

     First seven issues of User's Guide are great for learning CP/M, WordStar, 
MailMerge,  SuperCalc,  Modem7,  dBASE II, T/Maker III and other popular 8-bit 
programs.   These back issues are sold for $6.00 each.   Exorbitant,  you say; 
yes, but worth it!
     It'll take approximately two (2) years of study and computer operation to 
feel  you know what's happening.   After 1000 hours of activity you are  above 
average in capability to understand the new and to do,  way ahead of  majority 
in these days of computer literacy--you know-you-know what's going on.  Wonder 
what a "power user" feels?   Study no more than two (2) hours per day.   Facts 
need  to  settle into your bones,  soul before more is laid on,  a basic  homo 
sapient learning characteristic.

Digital Research (Pacific Grove,  CA) continues to demonstrate truth of  harsh 
words  used  (see  15  October 1984 Newsletter  007,  page  4,  next  to  last 
paragraph) to describe their understanding of customers, of business, of life. 
(Yuppies and MBA's do not make a business.)  Their Unix activity is dissolved, 
as  is their languages division;  neither 8 nor 16-bit CP/M activity  remains. 
All  eggs  are in GEM (Graphics Environment Manager) basket...but  will  Apple 
Computers  sue?   We  expect  them to see really hard times in less  than  six 
months (DRI founder Gary Kildall deserves better;  Gordon Eubanks,  author  of 
EBasic and CBasic,  would agree),  unless a miracle!  May their new Concurrent 
DOS-286 take off.  See you down the lines...
