                             ZCPR3 NEWSLETTER 102

Z3 TIPS:  Latest updates to programs are on the ZCPR3 BBS:   CLEANDIR,  DPROG, 
DU3, FINDF, HELP, LDR, MCOPY, MENU, MKDIR, MU3, VFILER, VMENU, ZEX.  If having 
bug  troubles with any of these utilities,  you may wish to download them from 
415/489-9005.

ZCPR3 Super Shell:  Those who own Ampro Bookshelf Series of Z80 computers  are 
using  Friendly,  a  polished file manipulation  shell  running  under  ZCPR3.
Friendly  is a refined VFILER with extended menu-driven macro command ability.
It  comes with a comprehensive User Manual,  better than anything you've  seen
from Echelon.  Those running ZCPR3 on other computers who would like to obtain
the program,  please contact Ampro Computers,  P.O. Box 390427, Mountain View,
CA  94039,  telephone 415/962-0230.   Order from them with your  check,  money
order, Visa or Mastercard.  Price is $49.00 plus shipping and handling.

ZRDOS shipping date set!  Planned shipments start 14 January 1984.   Those who 
would like to upgrade to a super BDOS and no longer be dependent upon  Digital 
Research  can  now be fully free.   ZCPR3 combined with ZRDOS does it all  and 
with  complete  development system  utilities:   super-fast  macro  assembler, 
linker  and librarian,  with simple or full-screen debuggers,  and translators 
(Intel/Zilog/TDL/CDL) and disassemblers.  Some ZRDOS features:

          Downward compatible with CP/M-80, ZCPR3 full-compatibility
  Takes advantage of Z80 and Z800 Instruction Sets and Memory Address Space
  Uses ZCPR3 Wheel Byte to write-protect selected files from non-Wheel users
                    Changed Disks automatically logged in
               Read/Only Disk status maintained after warm boot
   Read Console Buffer Function (10) treats rubout (DEL) same as backspace
File Archive Attribute Bit set by Function 30, compatible with MP/M and CP/M 3
        Support Utilities Copy (useful for archiving and backup) plus
               Set and Display File Attribute programs included
            Enhanced Error Messages with non-cryptic announcements
             Extended Functions include set/reset warm boot trap
      Z800 version has over 47 non-CP/M Functions added to achieve easy
                           MS-DOS program migration
        Z80 version in hex code to patch existing CP/M system @ $49.50
                   Z800 version pricing not yet established

     Your  eyes  wet...and  bugs  of  CP/M  eliminated,   even  Function   37.
Documentation  is 35 pages of tight,  unambiguous language describing each DOS
function.   We are only handling ZRDOS on 8" SSSD disks at present;  if demand
is  high for other formats,  we will download.   The Z80 software  development
system  package  is $200.00 complete;  again,  Z800 version  pricing  not  yet
established.   Write  (please  don't  call) if you have questions  about  this
Lasting-Value Software.

No one wants to bring out or hear this kind of news but ZCPR3:   The Manual is 
scheduled  for delivery second week of January 1985.   Book-production  delays 
has  caused  this  greater-than-expected  additional  delivery  delay.    More 
patience from us indicated here!   We need this book badly;  and from what  we 
know, it's worth the waiting.

New-Users-of-SYSLIB3_(S3)_Corner:   Our ZCPR3 utility MAC files are  excellent 
examples  of  S3 usage.   No need to create new wheels when there are so  many 
there for the rolling (S3 is so inexpensive,  on four disks for  $29.00,  plus 
S&H).   With S3 you raise your level of programming abstraction, think of user 
functionality  instead of so much time spent bit fiddling.   And produce dense 
and fast running code,  much faster than similar C language programs.   A neat 
submit  file  (M80.SUB) that automates assembly and link processes  and  works 
under both CP/M SUBMIT and ZCPR3 ZEX:

;
;  M80.SUB -- Microsoft MACRO-80 Assembler and L80 Linker
;
M80 =$1
ERA $1.BAK
ERA $1.COM
L80 /P:100,$1,A:VLIB/S,A:Z3LIB/S,A:SYSLIB/S,$1/N,/U,/E
ERA $1.REL
;
;  Assembly Complete
;

     Your  assembly command line would be:   SUBMIT M80  <filename><cr>.   The 
filename  is passed to the command processor through $1  variable.   VLIB  and 
Z3LIB  is  included  in case you use their features;  no harm is done  if  you 
don't.   Understanding M80/L80 command-line syntax comes from Microsoft MACRO-
80 User's Manual.
     A similar,  but extended for ZEX,  file (M80.ZEX using FINDERR,  on ZCPR3 
BBS) that is more console operator interactive:

;
;   M80.ZEX -- MACRO-80 Assembler and Linker
;              with M80 Error Checking
;
;      ^& Suppress FALSE IF Printout
;
if nul $1 ;note Print Error Message
echo	^G**** No Parameter Specified ****
else	;note Perform Assembly
if ~exist $1.MAC ;note Print File Not Found
echo	**** File Not Found ****
else
M80 =$1
FINDERR
if 0    ;note No errors found, link file
ERA $1.BAK
ERA $1.COM
L80 /P:100,$1,A:VLIB/S,A:Z3LIB/S,A:SYSLIB/S,$1/N,/U,/E
else
if 0 2  ;note see if the errors are warnings
echo    ^G***WARNING ERROR***
if input Type T to Continue or F to Abort (Warning Errors)
ERA $1.BAK
ERA $1.COM
L80 /P:100,$1,A:VLIB/S,A:Z3LIB/S,A:SYSLIB/S,$1/N,/U,/E
fi      ;note on IF INPUT
else    ;note error is fatal
echo    ^G***FATAL ERROR IN ASSEMBLY***
fi;fi      ;note IF REG 0 and IF REG 0 2
ERA $1.REL
fi;fi   ;note on IF NUL and IF ~EXIST

     Richard Conn is presently finishing up a draft of ZCPR3:   The  Libraries 
and we intend to make it available (all 300 to 400 pages) to those interested. 
Price should be about $40.00.   We are self-publishing it as loose-leaf.   Buy 
yourself a three-ring binder and be ready to read.  Or use same binder holding 
SAMPLER and Discat manual.

Term3  is  going into beta testing this week.   Won't be long now before  this 
program  is shipping.   Some bells and whistles are:  1)  Auto-answering  your 
phone  allowing the caller to access your computer files,  no BYE  needed;  2) 
dual  windows for simultaneous sending and receiving in the Conversation Mode, 
without interference;  3) main-frame protocol,  KERMIT,  plus TERM, CompuServe 
CIS  and XMODEM;  4) ZCPR3 menu control;  5) four online editors to create and 
alter  multiple  telephone-number  tables,   communication  sets,  translation 
tables,  macro text and command generation with Z3-type IF-ELSE-FI conditional 
testing,  wild-card sequential telephone number dialings;  6) hooks to EMSG, a 
new message and electronic mail system; 7) and more!
     Operations and procedures are truly fantastic!  Even if you presently use 
Modem7,  Mdm7,  MEX or a commercial program, you'll want to own Term3--a truly 
elegant  communications  package from brilliant,  thoughtful mind  of  Richard 
Conn.   So  those  of you who have placed orders,  on faith,  will  have  your 
desires fully satisfied soon.  We thank you for patience!

Staying abreast of the fast moving hardware field is no easy task,  especially 
if interested in high-resolution graphics and the like.   (We notice  advances 
in  the S-100 bus microcomputer field are impressive.   Dual processor  cards, 
dense  RAM,  high clock rates.)  One interesting card produced by  Illuminated 
Technologies (P.O. Box 83348, Oklahoma City, OK 73148, telephone 405/943-8086) 
provides  3 million pixel display at a rate of 1.3 million pixels per  second! 
Complete  re-writing of console screen in less than 3 seconds;  that's  really 
good  for only an 8-bit bus computer!   The S-100 board sells for from $895 to 
$1195,  monochrome/single plane to 8 color/3 plane,  respectively.   If you're 
interested in single-board graphics, contact them.

Industry  Brief:   Dealers of IBM PC's,  XT's and PCjr's  are  discounting  so 
deeply,  it's  hard  to  project how smaller companies can stay in  the  hunt.  
Tandy  has taken up the search with their Model 1100.   Apple will have to  do 
even  more  to  advance  in business circles.   The new  year  will  see  many 
companies  going belly-up.   We encourage extreme energy expenditure  to  stay 
alive...little  companies'  activities are life-blood to commerce  muscle  and 
tissue.

Something  about  the  Season  (Winter Solstice):  The planet  Earth  and  its 
biological  life  universally acknowledge this season above the  other  three.  
New beginnings are possible;  time to eliminate undesirable habit patterns  in 
our lives;  time to sense the moment for potential change and make change part 
of  our life.   Will it to happen...there's only a few moments in any  earthly 
cycle for our will to truly express itself, or to even have one!
     To  each season its will;  give me no roses in winter or snow in  summer, 
each  season  has  its  place,   power,  and  influence.   But  believe,  know 
opportunity  for useful change is now!   Consistency is the last refuge of the 
unimaginative.   Please use imagination!  (Next newsletter is dated 14 January 
1985, missing a fortnight, a beat, our window for change.)
