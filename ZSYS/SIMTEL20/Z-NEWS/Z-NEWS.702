==============================================================================
NUKEY.    Z-Com  author and Good-Neighbor Helper, Joe Wright,  San  Jose,  CA, 
produces  NuKey, a greatly enhanced ZCPR3 keyboard redefiner package, Item  44 
on  our Price List.  Loaded with LDR, like other segments,  SYS.RCP,  SYS.NDR, 
RECORDER.IOP,  etc.,  a  total of six types, we have a valuable  new  tool  to 
automate our operations.  Using I/O Package space of 1.5k-bytes, Z-Com, SB180, 
and bootable-disk Kaypro and Morrow standard, NuKey doesn't use TPA space like 
normal  key redefiners do, permits CCP to be overwritten, and thus  gains  2k-
bytes of TPA space.  And NuKey has an extender key capability, i.e., a  single 
character is defined as an extender key, with any keypress following usable as 
a  "string" entry key.  Therefore, entire keyboard may be used for stings  and 
commands  you  define.   A redefined key can take on a length  of  up  to  550 
characters, or eleven keys of average 50 characters, 50 of average 11...
     NuKey handles one, two, three, or more characters generated by  function, 
numeric  pad,  and  editing keys; you can redefine them  just  like  a  single 
character  key.  Mix the different types together, NuKey handles them all,  up 
to 15 characters each.  Unique in the world of keyboard redefiners, we know of 
no other key definition program that handles such function keys correctly.
     At any time, a display of key values is available, keys can be  redefined 
and  deleted,  even from within an application or utility  program,  WordStar, 
Vfiler,  Term3, etc.  New definitions are saved in a file which you name  when 
returning to ZCPR3/Z-System command line.  nukey s fn.iop<cr> puts definitions 
into file "fn.iop".  ldr fn.iop<cr> puts IOP into memory.
     Definition files are created, as many as you need, for each of your major 
operations.   As  you  move  from  directory  to  directory  with  CD,  Change 
Directory,  utility,  standard ST alias loads the appropriate NuKey  IOP,  and 
optionally  a new NDR segment and other commands to set-up directory  environ-
ment.   Of course, you can load NuKey IOP's from any command line,  e.g.,  ldr 
nukey.iop<cr> does it for default IOP.
     We  use  back-apostrophe, "`", for our EXTend character,  and  backslash, 
"\", for our DEFine key.  Neither character is used by programs we use.   (But 
such  is  not necessarily true for you.)  These two keys must be  defined  for 
NuKey to perform its many tricks.  Select any two from your CRT keyboard.
     NuKey auto-installs and comes with a ZCPR3 structured 19k-byte online HLP 
file.   Works  from  command line, from within WordStar,  Newword,  and  other 
programs.
     NuKey,  priced $39.95 alone, bundled with similarly priced B/Printer  and 
I/O  Recorder  is effectively only $29.98, package total of $89.95.   Item  45 
trio  saves  $29.90  over getting each program singularly.   More  good  news: 
existing users of PKey can upgrade to NuKey for customary $20.00 plus shipping 
and handling costs.

From Our Mail Box.   "Zinfandel and Zydeco tacos for breakfast!  I've got  the 
Z-System  in my blood too--but not that much," writes Ed Dowdell,  Massapequa, 
NY.  Ed, we admit to having abnormal break-fast habits, but after working  all 
night there's nothing like a sit-down fancy, something different, shared  with 
someone.   President  of  1200-member Long  Island  Computer  Association,  Ed 
describes  his computing system, SDS SBC-100 and SB180 with Chinon drives,  as 
he  renews  his  newsletter subscription and orders Z80  Turbo  Modula-2.   If 
interested  in joining LICA or in Ed's hardware, call 516/249-9308  between  7 
and 10 PM Eastern time.  Have a good year, Ed.
     "I am impressed by Z-Catalog which is well written and attractive in  its 
emphasis  to a non-hacker like myself...[it is] an  eye-opener...and  Z-System 
User's Guide is a gem for power users," declares Paul Naitoh, San Diego, CA.
     James Bottom, Salem, OR, writes, "I just finished reading the new catalog 
cover  to  cover.  I know of no other mail order piece I've  done  that  with!
It's  as  much a tutorial as a sales piece, and I think that's  what  held  my 
interest.  Congratulations."
     Lester  Welch, Hinsdale, IL, thought Turbo Modula-2 package had a bug  in 
it because it wouldn't correctly compile TICKTOCK.MOD as shown on page 455  of 
User's Guide.  Well, it turns out the program listing is in error (ole bug-in-
the-book  syndrome).   Corrected program (TickTock, basis for  program  multi-
tasking) is below and on Z-Nodes.  Thanks go to .lh 6
Lester for pointing to something wrong--it's fixed now.

     "The  last couple of years has been hard on many software  companies.   I 
believe that this shakeout, though difficult, is good for the industry in  the 
long run.  Our own strategy in this period has been: be cautious about  trying 
new  advertising,  and  provide good service and  new  products  for  existing 
customers.   That  is the strategy that we will continue to follow.   We  will 
concentrate  our efforts on developing new products and selling them  to  you, 
our  existing customers.  I thank you for your support this year.  I wish  you 
happy holidays."  Sincerely, James River, Minneapolis, MN (Z-News 608-1).  You 
know, that's also our business policy...always has been.  Customers,  service, 
quality.
     Stan  Bercovitch,  North  Fort Myers, FL, sends us  his  four  perception 
levels  of computer people.  "1) hacker, definition as given in Z-News  006-3.
2)  Mayvin,  now accepted in English, but really a Yiddish word  derived  from 
Hebrew.   The  Hebrew word Mayvin means 'someone  who  understands.'   Yiddish 
expanded on that to include an expert, but even more than an expert, 'one  who 
knows  and  understands  almost  instinctively' (the word  can  also  be  used 
sarcastically 'What makes you a mayvin?').  To me, the computer mayvin is  the 
one  who  loads a new piece of software and without benefit  of  documentation 
knows  instinctively  what the program does and how to use  it.   3)  Chipper, 
partial  definition in Z-News 605-1, has enough interest and  perseverance  to 
really  try  to  learn  a  program, is  willing  to  experiment  [not  fearing 
mistakes],  has  the tenacity to interpret and  translate  documentation  into 
English, and [one] who attempts to make software and operating systems do  all 
the things they are supposed to do (or even things no one has thought of yet).
He does not have the talent or genius to be a hacker.  And 4) average computer 
user.   This  latter  is  the  person who 'uses  a  computer'  for  speed  and 
convenience.   He  learns and gets help in learning the basics of one  or  two 
programs and sees no need to go much farther than that.  Some (make that many) 
would  like to know more (hence computer user groups) but need to be led,  and 
shown each step of anything new, one item at a time."  That's it.  And here we 
see why we have such trouble dealing with each other--we are not the same, but 
are from different levels of knowledge and understanding, even from  different 
levels  of being.  So be it!  Communications--let's work on freely being  able 
to move from one level to another--that's what it's all about.  So be it!

Z-User's  Corner.    John  T.  Brown's  JB-VFCMD.LBR  package  (Z-News  608-1) 
contains many useful automation examples applicable to your computer  environ-
ment.  Print-out the documentation, CMD, and VMN files.  Spend about two hours 
studying what John has done.  Then think of ways they apply to your particular 
situation.   He takes time and writes explanations for his CMD and  VMN  files 
and  how they tie-in with custom aliases and ARUNZ.  Let's go through  one  of 
his  more  interesting  nested command macros.  On VFILER  CMD  menu  we  find 
command F for Finding Files.  VFILER CMD line is simple: "f!run findf".  "run" 
is ARUNZ renamed and "findf" is alias line in ALIAS.CMD script file.  Line  is 
long:

  findf cls;getvar fif file(s) to look for (e.g., *.doc):;              <<
  if xn find file(s) on specific drive;getvar gd which drive:;          <<
  resolve findf26 %gd:%fif;else;resolve findf26 %fif;fi;era ROOT:sh.var

"findf"  is alias name in ALIAS.CMD and alias uses FINDF v2.6  utility,  "cls" 
clears  display screen, "fif" is shell variable holding file mask you  entered 
to  control search, and in same vein, "gd" for specific drive, if not all,  to 
search--both  variables held in standard, auto-created ZCPR3 "sh.var" file  in 
ROOT:  directory.   "if"  should be v1.3 or 1.4.  "xn"  is  extended  "input."
Dialog prompts:

        FILE(S) TO LOOK FOR (E.G., *.DOC):        you enter file mask
        FIND FILE(S) ON SPECIFIC DRIVE (Y/N)?     answer y or n
        WHICH DRIVE:                              if y, state drive

ARUNZ,  accessing  ALIAS.CMD  script,  reduces disk  space  required  to  hold 
aliases.  John's CMD script contains 28 macros, used for task automation.  Ten 
aliases  are  in ALIAS.CMD and two VMENU VMNs are used, i.e.,  called.   These 
scripts  provide  much  food for further thought  to  nourish  our  community.
Complete  documentation associated with John's system, plus all public  domain 
files, are in JB-VFCMD.LBR on SUS #8 and on Z-Nodes.
     If  command  line buffer overflows with too-lengthy alias  script,  three 
things can be done.  1) shorten text prompts, 2) rename utility files to  two-
letters,  e.g., FINDF becomes FF, GETVAR goes to GV, etc., and 3) break  alias 
into  parts by one alias calling another, e.g., "findf" above can  have  first 
line as an alias calling next two lines as a nested alias.  (A fourth  option, 
for  chippers  and  hackers  only, increases CLB  to  250  characters  by  re-
generating ZCPR3 buffer allocation in your BIOS.)
     Documentation  and wonderful tutorial in VLIB.LBR (also on SUS #8 and  on 
Z-Nodes)  shows  how  to create nested, recursive  aliases  using  Jay  Sage's 
VALIAS.
                         Hot Tip for Users of Newword
                         ----------------------------
        Many  state "Newword cannot output formatted text to  a  file, 
        like  WordStar  can."  But NW can!  Using the  PRVIEW  printer 
        driver,  formatted  text is sent to default  file  PREVIEW.NW.  
        Control codes are retained to control printer if file is later 
        printed.  Correctly handles paging.  Install NW for your prin-
        ter but keep the PRVIEW driver, using NWPRMAKE.COM, as one  of 
        the "printers" you use.  Then when at "Opening Menu", enter  P 
        followed by file name to "print", or ^R if file is the one you 
        were editing.  Enter five (5) more <cr>'s at NW prompts to get 
        to  "Name  of printer?" prompt.  NW  shows  available  printer 
        drivers at bottom of screen.  Now, type-in PRVIEW<cr> to  send 
        file  fully formatted to PREVIEW.NW file that is  auto-created 
        by NW.  After transfer, appropriately rename this file.
                     -----------------------------------
     An  aside.  Using Z80 CRUNCH (GEL 2.3) takes 21 seconds to crunch a  195-
record  file,  8080-coded  FCRUNCH takes 32 seconds.   Quickness  may  not  be 
entirely  due to Z80 versus 8080 assembly language code--we don't know;  none-
theless, Z80 version is over 30% faster.
     In  Santa  Monica, CA, Bridger Mitchell, author of JetFind,  spends  time 
developing  fastest  Sieve  of Eratosthenes  assembly  language  routine  yet.
Called JetPrime, it finds prime numbers faster than anything we have yet seen.
On  our  Z80  Ampro, run time is 4.1 seconds.  Best mark  previously  was  6.6 
seconds  from SIEVEZ80.COM.  Find Z80 ZAS version of JetPrime source  and  COM 
files in JPRIME.LBR on Z-Nodes everywhere (and on SUS #9).

Word  Counting Utilities.   WC is the utility distributed with The  Word  Plus 
spelling  check and correction program.  ZWC is on disk #1 from  ZSIG,  NAOG's 
public  domain  library (Z-News 701-1).  And WCLCCC is on SUS  #2  as  WC.COM.
Benchmarking these three "word counting" programs on a short, 24k-bytes,  174-
record text file produced this result:

             Program                   Time, seconds   Word Count
             WC, Oasis Systems             10.96         3,024
             ZWC, ZSIG Disk #1              9.77         3,067
             WCLCCC, C/80 C Program        18.01         3,060

Both  WC and ZWC quickly count words in but a single file.  WCLCCC does  more, 
but not as quickly.  Here's a command line followed by the screen display:

                   C0:LETTERS>wclccc file.ft file2.ft<cr>

                                  Chars   Words   Lines
                   FILE.FT:       2432    406     63
                   FILE2.FT:      23188   3491    399
                   Totals:        25620   3897    462
   
     The C/80 WCLCCC not only counts words, but also lines and characters, and 
does it for filelists, using spaces as file name delimiters instead of commas, 
and  wild card (* and ?) file names.  It puts resultant data in a neat  sorted 
table.   It  is also slow, but not that slow, C/80 being overall  the  fastest 
high-level language we have tested.
     Each  program  has a slightly different criteria for defining  a  "word."
That's  why  count ranged from 3,024 to 3,067.  Our WCLCCC  counts  hyphenated 
words  appearing  at  end  of lines as two  words,  i.e.,  newlines  are  word 
demarcations,  along with spaces and tabs.       Measurements were made  using 
an  electronic timer, all files called from Z-System command line.  Text  file 
was on default directory, but word-count programs were in COMMAND.LBR   called 
as aliases from  ALIAS.CMD  with  ARUNZ  renamed to  CMDRUN  (technique of  Z-
News  701-3).   For  test, we used one of our Ampro SCSI hard  disk  4mHz  Z80 
machines.
     Those  using C/80 compiler from Software Toolworks,  Z-News  605-1/306-1, 
should  look  into video screen handling routines produced by  Edward  Schram, 
Norfolk,  VA.  Library file CVIDLIB.LBR contains them all.  On Z-Nodes and  on 
upcoming  SUS #9.  Hope someone does the same thing for Turbo  Modula-2.   And 
who  is first to write WC in Turbo Modula-2?  (Steve Cohen, Glenn Brooke,  are 
you  ready  to  go  to work?  If so, while at it, please  add  a  4th  column, 
Records, and include an internal exclude table to ignore binary files.) 

SUS  Report.    We  are overrunning ourselves  with  Software  Update  Service 
diskettes.   We promised an average of nine (9) per year.  Well, in less  than 
five  months we have had seven (7).  (SUS #9 has already begun  filling.   New 
submissions by Rick Charnes, Edward Schram, and Terry Smythe are welcomed  and 
worthwhile.)   Here's  what  #8  looks like as we get  ready  to  ship  it  to 
subscribers.

COM file we used for benchmarking, as reported in Z-News 607 and 608.  TLIB is 
greatly  enhanced  "type library files," with TLF2 a variation.   CRUNCH23  is 
latest released CRUNCH and UNCR from Steven Greenberg.  VMENU25 is an official 
update.  TCVIEW, created by Jay Roumman, is new Z-System utility to show  TCAP 
data,  either  in memory (loaded as part of SYS.ENV) or from  Z3T  files.   We 
fully  support  this utility and thank Jay for thinking of and  providing  it.
     Now, here's where we stand with Software Update Service diskette #9.

for table of services).

Software  Beat.   Newword, v2.18, the latest for Z80s, plus The Word Plus,  is 
available  from Analytical Products, our bootable-disk Z-System  supplier  for 
Heath/Zenith H/Z89/90 machines, even hard sector.  Wordprocessor and  spelling 
check/correction  combination is only $145.00.  To place order, contact  Peter 
Shkabara,  213 Teri Sue Lane, Buellton, CA 93427, telephone 805/688-0826.   He 
takes checks, Visa/MC credit cards, and CODs.
     Presently  we  use  PropStar from Civil Computing  Corp.,  2111  Research 
Drive, Suite #1, Livermore, CA 94550, 415/455-8086 (Z-News 304-2), for  print-
ing proportionally spaced fonts and flush-left/right line margins, and numbers 
in columns (see "Word Counting Utilities" paragraph above).  Directly  handles 
all  WordStar  "dot"  commands except headers, footers,  and  page  numbering.
Version 2.0d is priced $79.95, upgrade from earlier versions is $30.00.  Other 
options  soon become available for controlling modern precision  printers  and 
typesetters.   These  include TypeFit and PrintStar (aka Headliner  and  other 
names).   Both  produce  good-looking text.  More from us  as  software  nears 
completion, exits beta testing.
     Managing  many  text files on big disk systems where you  can't  remember 
where  something  is  is  make easy by text  search  software.   Here's  where 
JetFind, written by Bridger Mitchell, can be a big help, in first finding what 
you  want  and then, optionally, automatically placing it in a  file,  telling 
where  it came from.  File is used to hold text later read-into  wordprocessor 
documents.  JetFind locates text, 2 to 6 times faster than other string search 
programs,  in multiple filelists crossing directories.  JetFind  is  available 
from Echelon for Z80/HD64180 CP/M and Z-System machines for $39.95, plus $4.00 
shipping and handling, continental USA and Canada.

In  Other  Words.   USA collectively is personified by dear  President  Ronald 
Reagan.   But what is he, what are we?  Do we see through surface, past  skin, 
to  bone?  Or are we a land of "surface" people!  Global leaders we  are,  but 
how  long  is it so?  Where is discipline, our yoke for truth, at  any  price?
Truth IS!  Only it washes.  Try it and SEE.
     There's  no scarcity of the good things if we live in the  present--waste 
not mental energy.  Past and future are pure abstraction, now is whole!
==============================================================================
Of  Angels and Eagles.   The junction, i.e., the tension-point of past  mental 
energy  and  future mental energy, is the present.  One  energy  cannot  exist 
without the other two.  Reality of the present comes from essence of both  the 
past  and  the  future.  Present is substance concrete, other  two  much  more 
abstract.   Clearly we deal with gossamer principles, very light  and  quick--
ones governed by few laws--that are free!  See you down the lines...
