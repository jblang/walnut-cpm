Of Significance.   Steve Ciarcia's Circuit Cellar column, in January 1987 BYTE 
magazine,  provides details of Turbo Modula-2 and Graphix Toolbox  for  GT180.
Now  SB180 owners have easy path to high-resolution graphics beyond color  IBM 
EGA,  Commodore Amiga, and Atari 520ST, and monochrome Apple  Macintosh.   Our 
cup fills, runs over!  See November and December 1986 BYTE.  Order your  GT180 
color graphics co-board, from Micromint Inc., 4 Park Street, Vernon, CT 06066, 
800/635-3355,  203/871-6170,  Telex:  643331.  While at it, you  may  wish  to 
upgrade  to new SB180FX, single-board computer enhancement of original  SB180.
You owe it to yourself.  Christmas is coming...
     M.A.N. Systems, 323 N. 3rd, Medford, OK 73759, telephone 405/395-3849 (Z-
News 505-5, 507-4), the folks with TR-XL180, HD64180 add-on for TRS-80 Model 4 
machines,  now has add-on, with 256k-byte RAM disk, for Ampro  Z80  computers.
And the real good news: M.A.N./Ampro combination permits using Micromint GT180 
color  graphics board with Graphix Toolbox software.  (M.A.N. has adopted,  as 
we hope others will, the SB180 expansion bus.)  Who said CP/M-compatible 8-bit 
computing is dead-end street?
     --------------------------------------------------------------------
From Our Mail Box.   Many have asked us to recommend sources of CP/M software, 
i.e., where to buy.  Three major companies come to mind:

 The Software Toolworks        Spite Software        Central Computer Products
 9713 Santa Monica Blvd. #204  4875 S.W. 19th Drive  330 Central Avenue
 Beverly Hills, CA  90210      Portland, OR  97201   Fillmore, CA  93015
 800/223-8665                  800/237-9111          800/624-5628

Write  or  call  for  their catalogs.  You may be  surprised  by  quantity  of 
software packages available for CP/M-compatible computers.
     Lloyd  Hogan, South Hadley, MA, writes that "our concept of  'money'  and 
'life' is a little jaundiced," Z-News 305-5 and 508-5.  Lloyd, please give  us 
benefit of your thinking on where, how, and why we are off-base, wrong.
     Some  of  you write expressing opinion that we should give  more  ink  to 
describing value of Z-Index.  Well, we announced and discussed Z-Index in 506-
2 and clarified our offering in 507-5.  Thirty-five pages reference over  1700 
topics,  contain cross-references, permit easy access to subjects  covered  in 
Issues  001  through 508 of Z-News.  Planned periodic updates should  keep  Z-
Index reasonably current.  Buy it!  Z-Index is $8.95, Item 89 on Echelon Price 
List; Z-News is $24.00 per year, Item 83.  We need your subscription!
     Stan Bercovitch, North Fort Myers, FL, writes and wishes LX, LGET,  NULU, 
and  VFILER  had  uncrunch capability.  He goes on to  wonder  if  COM,  i.e., 
binary, files are worth either squeezing or crunching.  Well, we feel  because 
of  the nature of COM files not much is gained by compressing.  But  there  is 
nothing  wrong  with compressing them, we just don't save much disk  space  by 
doing  so.   In fact, depending on program content, there are  times  we  lose 
space.   Thus  LX  does  not  have ability to  run  squeezed  COM  files  from 
libraries.   LGET  can unsqueeze on extraction.  Notice benchmarks  in  Z-News 
508-4  showing  results  from compressing  "binary"  files--not  much  gained.
Hopefully, as stated in Z-News 602-2, "We must get to putting UNCR into  NULU, 
VTYPE, and VFILER."  As a seeming afterthought, Stan declares himself to be  a 
"chipper," which he defines as one who makes a program patch now-and-then, and 
not  a  "hacker."  Z-News 006-3 has our definition of  hacker:  "an  intensely 
caring human being who loves to design, write and modify computer programs."
     "Echelon  has helped make the business of business a lot more  fun  these 
days and we want you to know it."  Thanks Virgil Cooper, Carpinteria, CA,  for 
kind  words.   When  we are learning we are having fun.  Virgil  is  about  to 
purchase  "a  180 computer" but can't decide between SB180 and DT42.   What  a 
decision to have to make!  (We could not be without both.)
     "I  am happy to renew [my subscription to] the newsletter...keep  up  the 
good  work!  I learn much from your model menus displaying the use of  various 
utilities.  Can you feature your Archive Copy utility in some future issue [of 
Z-News]?" asks Larry Owens, Amherst, MA.  Larry, your request is a command...

Z-User's  Corner.    Archive Copy, AC.COM Version 4.4 on SUS  #6,  is  mature, 
fast, versatile, general purpose file copy and archiving program.  Written  by 
ZRDOS author, Dennis Wright, AC has many useful features to automate our  day-
to-day computer operations, either from menu command lines or in aliases.
     Z-News  509-1  shows help screen available from within  AC,  command:  ac 
//<cr>.   Though  shown  for  v4.3, it still applies  since  no  changes  have 
occurred going to v4.4.  AC has eight trailing command line options (A, B,  E, 
G,  N, O, Q, and R) changing program's default copy characteristics.   Several 
options  may  be used simultaneously.  Also, AC permits declaring a  new  file 
name  on copying.  Dual syntax permits copying CP/M, DEC "to/from" style,  and 
Microsoft MS-DOS "from/to" style.
     Using "E" option turns AC into a "move" utility.  Copying a file from one 
directory  to another leaves original or source file in place;  moving  erases 
original  leaving only destination file, the copy, in place.  Using  "to/from" 
syntax, command: ac a0:=fn.ft /e<cr> copies file fn.ft to drive drive A,  user 
0 from current (default) directory, then erases fn.ft from current  directory.
Or,  simultaneously changing file name while moving: ac  a0:newf=fn.ft  /e<cr> 
where  "newf" is new name of fn.ft.  A common command: ac a12:=*.*<cr>  copies 
to, e.g., a12: directory all files from current directory.
     Control-C terminates process immediately, if multi-file copy, after  file 
presently being copied has completed.
     Before going into archiving usage of AC, we review backup requirements of 
floppy  and  hard  disks.  First, for floppy-based systems.   After  years  of 
experience,  we  conclude every disk should have a duplicate, i.e.,  an  exact 
copy  of itself.  We call this copy a "backup."  For extremely  critical  data 
two,  or  even  three, backup copies are recommended.  If data  is  lost  from 
"working"  disk,  backup  disk data can be used to  recover  to  near-current, 
depending on status of copies versus working disk.
     Acknowledging as valid above computer backup philosophy, a simple  alias, 
we  call it BAK, ac backup:=*.* /b copies all changed and  un-archived.  i.e., 
new, files to disk drive called "backup" from current drive.  An exact copy is 
made,  using "B" option, source directory by source directory  to  destination 
directory by destination directory.  Floppy backup drive user area 0 is  named 
"backup."  Or you could use your drive/user area designation instead of  named 
directory.  We assume two or more physical drives in your system.  (See Z-News 
301-2 for discussion of number of drives in system.)  Every time a session  is 
complete,  with  backup  diskette  in "backup" drive,  enter  bak<cr>  and  AC 
automatically  copies  all  changed  files to  backup  diskette.   Our  normal 
procedure  is to have two diskettes in one storage, protective envelop.   Both 
come  out and are placed into their respective drives when we wish to work  on 
one.   Backing-up becomes second nature to our operations.  You only  have  to 
lose,  e.g.,  8  hours  of  work and it too  becomes  second  nature  to  your 
operations.
     Hard disk systems are not much different operationally from  floppy-based 
systems,  except there is less changing-out of diskettes.  Only  the  "backup" 
diskette is changed-out to provide orderly duplication, as needed, to  protect 
your  current work.  Pairing of diskettes do not apply.  But a  new  strategy, 
using  an  intermediary backup disk separate from archive  library  diskettes, 
comes  into play to minimize data lost if an electrical power-outage or  drive 
read/write  head  crush should occur.  We constantly backup working  files  to 
this  scratch  diskette, from any directory.  At day's end, we backup  to  our 
archive diskettes which are arranged by hard-disk directory.
     DISCAT  is used to catalog all files.  Our diskette labeling system  uses 
drive/user  area as disk name followed by sequential numbering as  disk  type.
Examples: A6.007 is archive diskette for drive A, user 6, seventh diskette  of 
our physical library; D9.044, directory D9: on 44th diskette.  Of course, many 
files in this library are not online (we have over 100 megabytes on floppies), 
thus  we  need  DISCAT  to determine quickly diskette  number  where  file  of 
interest  is found.  You can use directory names, up to 8 characters for  disk 
name, instead of letter and number--it is up to you.  You choose!  We have 128 
directories on our main Z-System computer in four partitions, only 28 of  them 
have names.  So we use letter/number to catalog them.
     By the way, scratch diskette, since it is in constant use, is of  highest 
quality we can buy.  It's our first line of defense against lost data,  either 
from hard or RAM disk.  Our archive diskettes are usually run-of-the-mill.
     Again,  we keep in backup drive a scratch diskette to  constantly  backup 
newly  created text, as we generate it.  We save to this disk every 5  minutes 
or  so,  to  be on safe side.  (One reason Oneac Systems's  ON!  computer  was 
created by Nick DeWolf was to protect lines deep absolutely against data  loss 
under  any condition, period--and that it does!  See Z-News 408-1 or write  to 
them  for  literature: ON! Systems, 27944 N. Bradley  Road,  Libertyville,  IL 
60048, telephone 312/680-4680.)
     More  philosophy...each directory of a hard disk system requires  one  or 
more  associated  backup  diskettes (we don't particularly  like  tape  backup 
machines  because of their serial nature, thus their slowness).  Depending  on 
storage capacity of your floppy drive (removable media storage), one, two,  or 
three  diskettes may be needed.  On one of our Ampro Z-System  20-megabyte  HD 
machines,  we  use 782k-byte 96tpi floppies.  We use same on  our  10-megabyte 
SB180  computer.  We (try to) keep storage space used on each directory  below 
floppy capacity, thus one diskette is needed per directory.
     Here,  for  hard disk systems, and for big RAM disks,  our  backup  alias 
copies   only  changed  and  non-archived  files  in  current  directory;   ac 
backup:=*.*  /a  does the job, for both hard and RAM disks.  On  our  SemiDisk 
DT42  with  2.7-megabyte Kodak floppy, we use but three diskettes  to  archive 
backup  entire  8 megabytes of RAM main storage.   Remember,  once  first-time 
backup  is completed, only newly created and changed files get  copied  during 
subsequent  backup operations.  Backup is fast and simple because  AC,  ZCPR3, 
and ZRDOS work together.  When we upgrade RAM to 32 megabytes, takes 12  Kodak 
floppies for complete backup--not an unreasonably large number.
     A  menu command line that loads your wordprocessor, Newword in  our  case 
here, with file pointed to under VMENU or VFILER is:

                          1 nw $pf;ac BACKUP:=*.* /a

The  leading "1" is key character you gently strike to activate  command;  its 
choice, letter or number from 36 available, A through Z, 0 through 9, in ASCII 
set,  is part of your menu design.  (Use appropriate parameter for file  name, 
$pf  for  VMENU, %f for VFILER.)  After finishing edit/print  session,  AC  is 
loaded,  then  copies  to backup disk drive all new  and  changed  files  from 
current-directory, automatically.  You don't think about it, it just happens.
     Variations  possible  allow  fine,  custom  control  of  your  particular 
computing   environment.   Using  "B"  option,  instead  of  "A"  above,   all 
directories of disk are copied.  Adding "Q" option causes AC to prompt you  if 
copy is desired or not, (y/n).  If your disk system is stable, i.e., reliable, 
you may wish to add "N" option to cut copy-time in half, by eliminating  "CRC" 
verification,  popular and positive data-checking technique used to make  sure 
one file is identical to another.
     Of  course,  different  BAK scripts may be used  in  different  directory 
areas.   Use Dennis Wright's DFA, Display File Attributes, utility to  display 
status  of  files  in  directory, archived or not.   SFA,  PROT,  and  PROTECT 
complement  file attribute management.  Also VFILER, v4.0 and later,  contains 
group  archive  of files.  Again, our cup runneth over!  Study  AC's  built-in 
help menu and HLP file.  Then optimize commands for your computing situations.

Z-User's Corner, Continued.   We have discussed protecting data by copying  it 
to  removable "backup" media.  What about copying often-used utility  programs 
to  RAM  for  quickening execution?  Richard Conn's MCOPY,  upgraded  by  many 
(Terry Carroll, Michael Bate, Steven Cohen, Jay Sage, etc.) to Version 4.5A/B, 
on  SUS #7, with its "N" opinion is ideal here.  If file already exist on  RAM 
disk,  copy  does  not occur.  (Many of us have  battery  protected  RAM  that 
retains  storage even when power is off.)  For example: you use one  directory 
for  system utilities and another for application programs that  benefit  from 
being  in RAM, like your disk-based wordprocessor (WordStar,  Newword,  etc.), 
MCOPY can be used to load, from disk to RAM, these files at computer cold boot 
time.
     Into your startup alias, the one that loads system segments and puts your 
system  in desired form, add, e.g., below line at place  after  initialization 
has  occurred (you could make it an alias to use external from and  nested  in 
your startup):

                      mcopy RAM:=ROOT:*.com,BASE:nw.* /n

Use  of  "/" is optional here, though we always do (use it) to  be  consistent 
with Z-System utilities that require it before options.  RAM is name given RAM 
drive, usually the M: directory (for memory) of less than 512k-byte RAM disks.
ROOT is conventional name given directory where utilities are stored.  BASE is 
used  for  application programs.  Use Richard  Conn's  named-directory  editor 
MKDIR  to do this.  For more on MKDIR, see Z-News 307-2, then read pages  3-12 
through 3-16 of Z-System User's Guide.   Use file list (see  Z-News 601-2  for 
definition) to copy exactly files wanted.  MCOPY has sufficient built-in  help 
to use without further documentation.  Entering mcopy //<cr> produces:

 MCOPY, Version 4.5
  Syntax:
    MCOPY du/dir:=[du/dir:]filename.typ,... o...
  Options:
    E -- No Existence Test
    I -- Inspect Files
    M -- Multiple Copy
    N -- No Replace
    Q -- Toggle Quiet
    V -- No Verify

"du/dir" indicates DU, drive/user area, or DIR, named directory mnemonic, form 
permitted.  "[du/dir:]" indicates either form is optional, as needed to get to 
files of interest from current, default directory.  "filename.typ,... "  means 
file list permitted.
     Combination of AC and MCOPY permits automatically handling files in  just 
about any file move or copy situation.  Write us showing how you use these two 
programs.  Thanks.

     In language capability, Turbo Modula-2 is midway between Ada and  Pascal.
It's best high-level language, in our opinion, yet devised for small computers 
(see  Z-News  604 for details, or file MODULA2.RAS found on  Z-Nodes  and  up-
coming SUS #7).  Turbo Modula-2 provides a far more efficient  production-code 
development  environment  than  does Turbo Pascal,  or  any  other  high-level 
language  we know of, mainly because of Borland's two-way  interactive  editor 
and  compiler, and because of "modular" character of Modula-2.  Runs  on  Z80- 
and  CP/M-compatible computers.  Priced presently at only $69.95,  comes  with 
huge,  552-page,  bound instruction book, published jointly by  Micromint  and 
Echelon.   Item  30  on  Echelon's latest Price  List.   Because  of  heft  of 
instruction  and  reference book, we charge $6.00 shipping  and  handling  for 
continental  USA;  elsewhere,  actual  postal  charges  plus  $2.00  handling.
Shipping date stands at 5 December 1986.  Order now, upgrade from your  Pascal
