==============================================================================
Of  Significance.    Bridger  Mitchell, Santa Monica,  CA,  has  been  quietly 
working  on  a Z-System compatible command processor for nearly the  last  two 
years.  Called BackGrounder II, it fills a gap in our system capability dearly 
needed.  Here's how Bridger describes what BGii can do for ZCPR3 and  Z-System 
users:

 o Compose  a  message with your full-screen editor while online  with  your
   telecom munications package.
 o Export  data  from one program into another by cutting  and  pasting  the
   screen,  e.g., from spreadsheet or string-search result to editor,  while 
   both tasks are active, if desired.
 o Use the Z-System structured HLP files while in the midst of a program.
 o Calculate  in  decimal or hex while in a program, and export  the  result 
   with one   keystroke to the program. 
 o Bi-directionally  type an ASCII (or a squeezed, forward only) file  while 
   in a program.
 o Save the console screen to the printer or to a file.
 o Write notes into a notepad while in the midst of a program.
 o Redirect  printer output to a file while macro key definitions are  still  
   available.
 o Print  any number of files, in priority order, in background  mode  while 
   regular   programs  proceed  and while key macro  definitions  are  still 
   available.
 o Add  customized  foreground and background commands to the  BGii  command  
   processor.
 o Customize the macro key definitions for individual programs and load that 
   key environment automatically or from within a program.

All  these things are possible with full compatibility with Z-System  environ-
ments, including ZRDOS v1.7 and beyond, and ZCPR v3.3 soon to be released.  We 
consider  BGii  a  major extension to Z-System.  Richard  Conn's  ZCPR3  added 
another dimension to CP/M, communications between successive tasks; BGii  adds 
communication  between  co-active tasks plus the  availability  of  background 
operating system commands.
     BGii is a virtual-memory extension (requiring about 100k-bytes of RAM  or 
hard disk) that works with straight CP/M systems, giving such systems all  the 
benefits  of  task  suspension,  context  switching,  and  use  of  over   100 
standardized Z-System utilities.  (Virtual memory techniques, like those  used 
by  WordStar  and Newword, extend available active program memory  into  disk-
based  storage.)  Occupies 4.75k-bytes of TPA in a conventional  CP/M  system, 
2.25k  in  a ZCPR3 one.  Installation is straight forward, in four  (4)  quick 
menu-driven  steps,  requiring no assembly or coding  knowledge.   Comes  with 
easy-to-read/understand loose-leaf, 140-pages, laser-typeset manual in beauti-
ful 3-ring binder.
     Putting it another way,  we like BGii's task-to-task data transfer,  task 
switching,  background commands and multifile background printing.  These  are 
the things that enhance the Z-System!  Additional details in coming issues...
     With  BGii  we  now  have more ways to do things  than  ever  before,  to 
personalize  environments  that work our way.  That's more than  can  be  said 
about most operating systems.  Bravo, Bridger!
     A  demo  version  of  BGii is on Z-Nodes and on  SUS  #10,  as  files  in 
BGIIDEM3.LBR,  with  complete  installation  instructions  for  use  on   your 
computer's  Drive A.  Echelon offers full-use BackGrounder II for $75.00  plus 
$4.00 shipping and handling, continental USA.  It's Item 10 on our Price List.

Kref's  TASK-MASTER Announced.   British OEM, Kref Computer Services,  Caerau, 
Llansadwrn, Menai Bridge, Gwynedd LL59 5SN, telephone 0248 810748, offers CMOS 
6mHz  Z80 processor compatible with all versions of the  British  Broadcasting 
Computer  computer supporting the Acorn TUBE interface.   Expansion  interface 
provides  one-megabyte of paged memory.  Keith France, one of Kref's  business 
partners  tells  us, "A one-megabyte RAM card and HD64180 version are  on  the 
drawing  boards."   Task-Master  package includes Z-System,  ZAS,  ZDM,  Turbo 
Pascal,  and several custom utilities to handle European disk  formatting  and 
file transfers.  Priced at #325.00, complete; software only, #130.00; post and 
packing  charge (S & H) is #6 and #4, respectively; VAT (Value Added  Tax)  is 
15%.   The  BBC  computer is used by Department of Education  schools  and  in 
universities as laboratory engines and has been a primary tool for eliminating 
computer illiteracy in the UK.  A substantial number are in homes also.   Here 
now, the power of Z on BBC computers!
     If  in  United  Kingdom, those interested in Z80  Turbo  Modula-2  should 
contact  Mr.  Ian Rangely, Grey Matter, Ltd., Prigg Meadow,  Ashburton,  Devon 
TQ13 7DF, telephone 0364 53499 for quick, economical delivery.  GM  advertises 
in International version of BYTE magazine.

From  Our  Mail  Box.   "Now that I have had time to sit down  and  play  with 
things  for a while, you might as well get your score card..."  writes  Daniel 
Brooks, Duluth, MN, about Z-System and SB180 documentation.  "Yes, you're  one 
of the few people that I swear by, not at.  You have done an excellent job  on 
your  [Micromint and EI] products.  This has made things quite a  pleasure  to 
work  with.  You will get first consideration when I start looking  at  future 
purchases."
     Gary  Marc  Remson, Sherman Oaks, CA, asks us to include a  command  line 
editor  in our next version of Z-System.  Gary, we feel HSH (SUS #2) and  VCED 
(SUS  #3) shells do all that most want command line editors,  re-call  history 
shells, to do.  Give them a try and let us know if anything more is needed.
     Answering  John  Waterman, Troy, NY--yes, XtraKey works  with  ZCPR3  and 
ZRDOS.   We are not so sure SmartKey does.  Our NuKey is best if you have  IOP 
installed,  like SB180 does.  And Z-Com presently does not have  PUBLIC  ZRDOS 
Plus installed in it.  Item 12 is used to overlay, semi-automatically, the  Z-
Com package to obtain public directory capability.

ingenious  hard  disk backup technique of Rick Charnes.  JETPRIME  is  Bridger 
Mitchell's fast assembly language routine for running BYTE's sieve  benchmark.
PDGUID02  covers Terry Smythe's much-needed recommendations for public  domain

     RESTORE2  is  a desirable utility that makes your disk,  especially  hard 
disk,  "new"  by eliminating file allocation-block fragmentation,  from  Steve 
Dirickson,  Poulsbo, WA.  Please carefully read the DOC file  associated  with 
RESTORE.  If your computer hardware is not absolutely stable, reliable, do not 
use RESTORE.
     SHUTILS2  and Z3VARS are Dreas Nielsen's updates for his  powerful  shell 
utilities  and a new REL library.  TM2NOT10 is Steven Hirsch's white paper  on 
his  experiences using FTL and Turbo Modula-2 with a big software project  for 
his company.
     ZPATCH10  is  sophisticated screen-oriented file-patcher,  best  we  have 
seen,  from Steven Cohen, Chicago, IL.  Its a full Z-System shell (returns  to 
itself after executing external commands) with edit and string-search capabil-
ity  and ease of use, in our opinion, without equal.  Has full HLP  file  with 
internal  chaining  as an option.  But put it in your ROOT, i.e., last  to  be 
searched, directory to start with.  Online HLP file tells how to patch  ZPATCH 
using itself, if you want other than as distributed, default options.  ZPATCH, 
programming at its finest, is state-of-the-art.

More  Modula-2  Benchmarks.   Dr. Mark Boyd, Asheville,  NC,  benchmarks  some 
Modula-2  packages  using his 5mHz Kaypro and Atari 1040ST  (full  comparative 
article  appears  in  upcoming  issue,  hopefully  April/May  '87,  of   Micro 
Cornucopia magazine):

                         Compiler         Code Size   Compile & Link   Run
            Sieve of Eratosthenes:
                         Turbo Modula-2      9984          11.2        6.9
                         FTL Modula-2        2367           9.0       12.0
                         Turbo Pascal        8498           1.5       18.9
                         TDI on 1040ST       3166          28.0        5.7
  File I/O and Copy 24k-byte file:
                         Turbo Modula-2       18k           51         80
                         FTL Modula-2         12k           80         99

Code  size  is  in bytes or k-bytes.  Compile & Link and  Run  (time)  are  in 
seconds.  TDI is a Modula-2 compiler for Atari 68000 (16/32-bit) machines.
     Sieve  is  classic BYTE benchmark.  File I/O and Copy  is  file  transfer 
program written in respective compilers' language and then timed for copying a 
24k  file.   Note Turbo Modula-2 on a Z80 is nearly as  quick  running  BYTE's 
sieve as TDI is on an Atari 68000.
     More  testing  with  Modula-2  by Phil  Hess,  Lafayette,  IN,  indicates 
superior performance from 8-bit systems.  Phil uses a 4mHz Z80 Morrow MD5  for 
his  benching  of Reinhold P. Weicker's Dhrystone as reported in  January  '87 
BYTE.   William  Miller provided the Modula-2 version of the  benchmark.   The 
Dhrystone standard "represents as closely as possible the actual mix of state-
ment  types and data accesses found in real programs, except I/O  statements."
Phil  obtained the source from BYTE, but had to debug it, "which was quite  an 
ordeal," of obvious and not so obvious typographical errors.  "The FTL compil-
er does not appear to be as sound as its version number would suggest.  In the 
course  of working with it on this benchmark alone, I discovered what  appears 
to  be two rather serious bugs as well as some odd linking problems."   Steven 
Hirsch  (in  TM2NOT10)  has similar things to say about  FTL,  the  reason  he 
switched to Turbo.

                Compiler            Code Size   Compile & Link   Speed
         Dhrystone:
                Turbo Modula-2 v1.0   19,968           62         188
                FTL Modula-2 v1.18    20,480           71         172

Code  Size  in bytes, Compile & Link in seconds, and Speed is  Dhrystones  per 
second  (D/s,  the higher the better).  Here Turbo shows its  compactness  and 
overall  speed.  As programs get large Turbo shines.  Source code for FTL  and 
Turbo versions, as developed by Phil, is on Z-Nodes as file DHRYS.LBR.
     Three  Modula-2  compilers for standard IBM PC's ranged  from  44,000  to 
74,000 bytes for Code Size, 35 to 114 seconds for Compile & Link to EXE  (COM) 
file, and 55 to 232 Dhrystones per second for Speed.  The slowest compile  and 
link was for the compiler producing the speediest code, but also produced  the 
most compact (see Jan '87 BYTE, pages 333-336, for more details).  A 5mHz  Z80 
produces 235 D/s; a 9.2mHz DT42 or SB180FX, over 500 D/s.
     Incidentally, introductory period for Turbo Modula-2 ends this month,  31 
March.   After that date price of TM-2 goes to $89.95 plus $6.00 S&H.   Orders 
received before then are processed for original $69.95 plus $6.00 S&H.  So  if 
you are planning to get TM-2, now is the time before price goes up.

Z-Node Activity.   Two Z-Node Sysops stay busy writing magazine articles.  Jay 
Sage,  Z-Node #3, Newton Centre, MA, 617/965-7259, has his informative  column 
in  The Computer Journal this month, Issue #27, starting page 28, about  ZSIG, 
command  line  generators,  and aliases under Z-System.   TCJ  is  reached  at 
406/257-9119.   Jay goes into more detail about latter two subjects than  pre-
viously  has been seen in print--excellent column!  (As an aside, don't  over-
look  ZSIG  as source for Z-System support and user-created  programs.   Bruce 
Morgen  is Chief with Jay Sage as Software Librarian.  Write  NAOG/ZSIG,  P.O. 
Box  2781,  Warminster, PA 18974, if interested.)  And do read  Art  Carlson's 
editorial on micromarket development, company success and failure, source code 
availability, hard drives versus RAM disks, and general 8-bit developments.
     In same TCJ issue, Jon Schneider, Z-Node #39, El Paso, TX,  915/592-4976, 
has  enlightening  piece  on using Hitachi HD64180 chip and  its  DMA  (Direct 
Memory  Access)  and  linear memory of 512k-bytes.  Starts on  page  23,  with 
tables  and diagrams to make features and operations clear.  Shows HD64180  to 
be better than Intel 8088/8086 in managing memory.  (See also EI's  HD64180.WZ 
file  written by Richard Conn on using Hitachi's HD64180, on  Z-Nodes  every-
where.)   Jon  runs an XLR8 (Z-News 703-1) board to give his  TRS-80  Model  4 
computer advanced performance.

Z-User's Corner.   Scanning crunched files has turned out to be more difficult 
than  first  thought.  Code to uncrunch a file is extensive,  much  more  than 
required to unsqueeze, and it's nearly impossible to back up through the text, 
bi-directionally.   Utilities  like VTYPE will never be able to  uncrunch  and 
scan  text  in  both directions, the way it presently  does  for  uncompressed 
files.  So, we have to get used to price paid for disk space saved by compres-
sing files.  JetFind, the string-search utility, does the best job we know of, 
because  of programming excellence of its author, Bridger Mitchell, of  typing 
compressed  text files, individual files and files from within  libraries,  to 
screen, file, and printer.  We use JetFind for most crunched file  management.
Aliases,  TLF2 and TLIB (SUS #8), are other lines of defense scanning text  in 
libraries containing crunched files.

    We  tripped  over  ourselves the other day.  You  may  find  situation 
    interesting as it shows how easy it is to go astray:  we changed ZCPR3 
    on  one of our office computers from always checking current disk  and 
    current user, i.e., current directory, for COM file search to one that 
    does  not.  Then we used PATH in our STARTUP alias to  initialize  our 
    computer environment and used, declared "$$" to indicate "current disk 
    and  current user".  After alias ran some of our CMD marcos and  other 
    aliases  did  not work correctly.  (Many of them  cause  logging  into 
    current  directory and from there execute commands.)  Well, to make  a 
    long  story  shorter,  we forgot something we  normally  do  so  well: 
    declare  the  "$" correctly.  ALIAS, MENU, and VMENU use the  $  as  a 
    trigger  (flag,  indicator)  for  passing  parameters.   (VFILER  uses 
    percent  sign,  "%".)   Now, PATH uses dollar  sign,  $,  to  indicate 
    current  disk/user.   In alias or menu lines, to pass  a  $  character 
    requires  entering  two, not one.  So our PATH command  expression  in 
    STARTUP  alias should be $$$$ for current disk and current user is  to 
    be searched.  The complete command we use is "PATH $$$$ A0 A15".   All 
    our aliases now work correctly again.

     We  are  always mentioning files that are available from  Z-Nodes.   Most 
nodes have such large disks and so many directory areas its time consuming  to 
find  the  files  of  interest.  Here's how we do  it  when  accessing  Z-Node 
Central.   After  logging in, we are in Z-Msg area.  We enter "J"  command  at 
message prompt which takes us immediately into files side (ZRDOS) of RAS node.
Typing "K" cancels introduction message and puts us at Z-System prompt.  Then, 
we  use  FIND  command to location the files we seek to  download.   FIND  has 
filelist  and wildcard capability, meaning in one command we can find all  the 
files we logged-on to get, if they are physically available.  An example:

              D1:UPLOADS>find hd1*.*,restor*.*,dhry*.*,bg*.*<cr>

What  you  type  is in lower-case light print; RAS  prompt,  upper-case  bold.
Notice  the use of commas to separate files, and the use of the "*" to  define 
the tail of the name and type.  Using * means a match is found even if you are 
not sure of, e.g., the version number or exact spelling of a file.  Just enter 
enough  of the leading portion of a name to be reasonable certain  of  finding 
what  you are looking for.  Then when FIND (FINDF, Richard Conn's super  quick 
file  search program) lists all the locations of the requested files  to  your 
screen,  write  the directories down, or better yet have your  printer  on  to 
auto-record  the response.  Now you can sequentially log into  each  directory 
and  use XMODEM to download to your computer the sought-after  treasures.   Or 
use  KMD/Term3  batch (Z-News 609-2) to transfer all files  with  one  command 
line.  The old MODEM7 batch is not quite the same as KMD batch and it does not 
work with Term3.
     While on a Z-Node's file side, do type PWD<cr> at command-line prompt  to 
see  all the name directories.  Don't forget and have your printer on  so  you 
get a hardcopy for future reference.

In  Other  Words.   Acceptance of the artificial over the real.   What  do  we 
learn  of a tree from looking at its photograph?  Can we gain from other  than 
first-hand experience?  Patrick Henry thought not, Z-News 703-5...but you say, 
he didn't live in our high technology world.  Does technology have anything to 
do  with  reality?  We think not!  Remember, technology comes from  root  word 
technique,  meaning "way of doing things"--crude oil to gasoline  engines  to, 
e.g.,  motor  cars, that move people from point A to B.  Technology  has  such 
emotional connotations these days, a mystique as it were, it has very  little, 
no certain meaning!
     The power of not defending your position...consider what we have here. We 
defend  because we are not sure of our stance, uncertain of what  comes  next! 
Defend  and  insecurity increases?  Not necessarily...as we defend  we  become 
aware of weakness in our position, learning from our opponent's argument. Next 
time we defend, our position is different, and we get closer to not needing  a 
defense.   Friendly,  non-combative debate--helpful for  personal  and  global 
development.
