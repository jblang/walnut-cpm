Z  TIPS.    There's over a million ways (literally) to configure and  assemble 
ZCPR3!   Standard ZCPR3 implementation (which we use here at EI) contains only 
SAVE,  GO,  GET,  and JUMP as intrinsic CP (command processor) commands; other 
resident (in-memory) commands TYPE,  LIST,  ERA,  REN, C(o)P(y), POKE, P(eek), 
ECHO, IF, ELSE, FI (endif) are in dynamically loadable RCPs and FCPs.  Normal-
ly,  DIR is a transient,  i.e., from disk.  CCP (console command processor, CP 
for short) occupies fixed 2k-bytes;  but resident packages,  each of 2k-bytes, 
can  be loaded when functional requirements demand different  commands,  e.g., 
DEBUG.RCP (MU3 as segment) for debugging programs versus more common  SYS.RCP. 
A sysop's RCP is different from RCP loaded for public callers.

Of  Cabbages  and  Kings.    Harvest being in  barn,  November  is  season  of 
thanksgiving  in USA culture.   We wish here to reflect on things for which we 
are  grateful.   Our life with continuous good health is one;  but  mainly  we 
focus on you, especially you who are learning while supporting what we do.  By 
name,   Marvin  Eyre,  Dennis  Wright,  Dave  McCord,  Kathy  Stough,  Patrick 
O'Connell,  Robert  Doolittle,  Al  Hawley,  Jay Sage,  Al  Dunsmuir,  Charles 
McMannis, Robert Peddicord, Richard Mead, and Bruce Aschenbrenner.
     And  Dreas Nielsen,  Bruce Morgen,  Ted  Silveira,  Paul  Pomerleau,  Tim 
Linehan,  Robert Tate,  Rea Williams,  Doug Thom, Norman Beeler, Norm Gregory, 
Marilyn Bailey,  Richard Jacobson,  Terry Smythe,  Ed Unrein, Charles Hoffman, 
Michael Ward, Jud Newell, Armon Tippitt, and finally, Richard Conn.
     More  could  be  added,  but these few we consciously believe  have  made 
possible what we do.   Those others get our thanks nonetheless,  those workers 
who  do in silence without notice.   We know they need not their names  listed 
here.  But without them, our species would have long ago perished.  We applaud 
our continued, but certainly uncertain, survival!
     Some few WONDER where our drive,  courage (?),  enthusiasm,  comes  from. 
WONDER  no  more...we work from natural forces...forces flowing  through  you, 
from  Eternity...  forces beyond TIME and space,  beyond Mother Earth,  Father 
Time of E.B. White's classic Charlotte's Web...forces of LAW, law which cannot 
be broken but which regulates All...we were vague and general,  now vivid  and 
particular because of your energy.

We Get Letters.   " ...[disk format] standardization is indeed much needed for 
8-bit  world.   However,  no details on formats were given...  " declares Mark 
Sihlanick,  Forest,  VA.   Sorry Mark,  we are working on a standards document 
now,  to be published as soon as finished.   Z-News 207 wanted to let everyone 
know  we  were  fostering  a few disk formats  we  feel  are  best.   Hardware 
manufacturers designing new 8-bit computers should use existing  formats,  the 
ones that are best for speed and capacity.
     Dale Updegrove writes from Phoenixville,  PA,  "I find myself looking for 
your  latest Z-News before the two weeks are up...Echelon is more like a  club 
than  a  business...is  interested in supplying more support rather  than  [in 
making] more profit."  Thanks!  we needed that.   Dale,  our major  short-term 
task  is  getting  you  to  regard  Z-System  as  we  do;  profits  come  from 
aspirations,  attitude  (see newsletter 009,  pg 7,  to know an aspect of  our 
business).

Z-Node  Activity.    A warm welcome to new Z-Node #44 and Sysop  Robert  Gear. 
Bob's  Phoenix,  AZ,  number is 602/279-2762 and is a first for us in Arizona. 
He is interested in ham radio packet networks,  as are other noders Bob  Finch 
and  John  D'Ausilio.   Also,  Bob's  "Doktur's" node serves  as  central  for 
despending medical information.
     Ed  Unrein  wants more non-local callers.   His RAS in beautiful  central 
Florida is a wonderland in itself:   305/295-0844.  If you can't travel there, 
you still can telecommunicate (one-day, teleport!).

Amateur Z User's Corner.   Logging into a directory may be done two ways.   1) 
Default log-in occurs when performed from command line,  and 2) current log-in 
occurs  when  performed  from within application  programs;  on  returning  to 
                       command  line,  default disk/user area is returned  to, 
                       shows.   Current  can  be made default by  declaration, 
                       e.g.,  in VFILER CMD scripts,  command clause  "%d%u:;" 
                       makes  current  directory the  default.   While  within 
   sketch of           VFILER,  default  is  shown when "Z" letter-command  is 
 mad hatter with       given  and command line prompt shows at lower  left  of 
    quote:             screen.   Current  always shows at upper  left,  either 
                       from  Files  or  built-in  Help  screens.   Of  course, 
 "And my current       current   and   default  simultaneously  may  be   same 
     became            directory.
     default."              When dealing with other than Z-System  application 
                       programs,  determine  if application uses current (most 
                       don't) or only default directories.   Then,  write your 
                       macro command lines accordingly.
                            Notice,  in Z-News 305,  bottom of pg 1, selective 
                       use of current disk/user "%d" and "%u" and actual drive 
                       letter ("a" therein) designation was required to freely 
                       move from directory to directory from within VFILER, to 
                       have  WordStar  and The WORD Plus  function  correctly. 
                       When  using with such  application  programs,  advanced 
                       features  of Z-System are absolutely required for  full 
                       automation  and resource-utilization efficiency.   Unix 
                       and PC-DOS do not have these features.
     Technically,  for you budding hackers,  default directory is contained as 
two  nibbles  at location 04 of Z-System Page 0,  memory space 00 to  FF  hex. 
Current is stored locally within ZRDOS buffer area.
     Our  shells  with  their  powerful user interface have  made  concept  of 
current  versus default important.   Principle under vanilla CP/M  was  little 
developed,  not  much thought of.   Remember what user areas were like  before 
SWEEP--they were simply not used!   SWEEP,  DISK7 started the ball rolling for 
FILER,  VFILER,  MENU,  FRIENDLYtm, and VMENU.  We now have better flexibility 
than PC-DOS or Unix!
     Recap:   default  (some  call  it  home) directory is the  one  shown  by 
operating  system prompt.   Application programs and utilities may  move  from 
default  by  internal command (log-in to new directory,  called  current)  but 
default  is  not  changed,  unless  changed at  command  line  prompt,  or  by 
declaration in a macro command.



                              Z-System  C O M M A N D S 

Frequently  used  commands are briefly described here.   Online HELP  facility 
gives  full  details  of these and remaining commands.   At  Z  command  line, 
immediate  usage and syntax help is available (if information is  appropriate) 
by typing <command> //<cr>.

AC        Archive  Copy  copies  files  from  one  location  to  another  with 
verification option, while setting file archive attribute.  Only changed files 
need be copied.
(V)ALIAS  The (V)ALIAS utility is used to create an Alias file and to  display 
its  contents.   An Alias is essentially a text script,  expanded and resolved 
(with parameter passing) when the Alias program is run.   Very complex command 
lines, complete with Flow Control (IF), can be included within an Alias.
ARUNZ     Extended command processor used to execute aliases within  ALIAS.CMD 
files.
CD        CD  permits  going  from one directory  to  another,  simultaneously 
running  environmental file (ST.COM) to establish the desired conditions in  a 
directory.  CD may require password to move to new directory.
CLEANDIR  Removes de-allocated references to files in the disk directory track 
area,  sorts  the  existing files in ascending or descending alpha  order  and 
packs the names together.  Used often nearly guarantees successful UNERASE.
CMDRUN    Default name for extended command processor used,  e.g.,  to execute 
COM files from COMMAND.LBR file.
COMMENT   Once  entered  all text typed at keyboard is  ignored  by  operating 
system.   Useful  to  output  text to printer while not  having  the  computer 
attempt to act on it,   and in local area networks (LANs).  Special "COMMENT>" 
prompt provided.
COMP      Compare  two  files displaying byte-for-byte match  and  difference. 
Split-screen display, showing match, differences, in both hex and ASCII, eases 
comparison.
CPSEL     Selects  one  of  two  consoles and one of four  printers  known  to 
system,  and line and page length, and whether form-feeds are available.  Used 
by PAGE and PRINT.
CRC       Runs  a  Cyclic  Redundancy Check  on  specified  files,  optionally 
creating a file of the values.  Useful to make sure files are identical.
DIR       Sorted default or declared directory files with sizes (lengths)  and 
disk  space used and remaining are displayed on console with this command,  by 
file  name or type.   Displays directory name,  if one,  and PUBLIC  files  in 
directories.
DFA       Display file attributes:  read-only, read-write, archive, wheel byte 
write-protected, etc.  Wild card file declaration permitted.
DU3       Disk  Utility  provides  full  screen-oriented  direct  disk  editor 
features.   Four  screens  of command information are internally available  by 
typing "?".
ECHO      Text  entered  at the command line is typed to  screen  without  the 
operating  system acting on it.   Useful to display messages from Aliases  and 
between commands of a multiple command line.
ELSE      The ELSE command is FCP-resident and toggles the Flow State.  If the 
current IF condition is TRUE, ELSE toggles it to FALSE, and vice-versa.
ERA       The  ERA  utility is used to remove (de-allocate) files from  disks. 
It is resident in either the RCP segment or in the ZCPR3 CCP module.
ERASE     The ERASE utility is the transient counterpart of ERA.   It is  more 
powerful than ERA, containing many more options and features.
(V)ERRORn Five  error handlers dynamically installed by entering their command 
name.   VERROR and ERROR2 are screen oriented;  recovery from a non-executable 
command in multiple command lines is handled gracefully and quickly.
ERRORX    The current error handler is disengaged with this command.
FI        FI is an FCP-resident command which terminates the current  IF.   FI 
is the same as ENDIF in concept (there is no ENDIF command in Z-System).
FINDF     Searches  for declared files in all user areas and disks in  system. 
Wild card (? and *) and multiple file names permitted.
GOTO      Unconditional branch in ZEX files; used in flow-controlled loops.
HELP      The  HELP command provides online documentation.   Typing HELP ZCPR3 
or ZRDOS1<cr> brings a menu of commands to peruse,  covering all aspects of Z-
System  operation.   ZRDOS:  and  ZCPR3:  The  Manual  are  used  for  further 
information.
IF        IF  is an FCP-resident command which tests a condition and sets  the 
Flow Control State to True or False.  If the Flow Control State is False, only 
FCP-resident commands are executed with all other commands skipped.
LX        Run  executable files from within library of files.   Other  library 
support utilities:  LGET, LHELP, and LLF.
MCOPY     MCOPY copies files to and from directories.  It provides an easy way 
to back-up files.  (CP from an RCP also copies and optionally renames files.)
(V)MENU   These  are  menu  subsystems under ZCPR3.   MNU and  VMN  menus  are 
created with your editor following rules detailed in HELP file system.
MKDIR     Named directories are created with MKDIR.  Any Disk or User Area can 
be  given  an up-to-eight-character name.   An access password  is  optionally 
permitted with each named directory.     
MU3       Memory Utility provides direct local memory (RAM)  editing.   Useful 
to observe immediate changes to selected areas of memory.
NOTE      Similar  to COMMENT,  but without special prompt and active for only 
one line.  Text typed is not acted upon by computer.
PAGE      The PAGE command sends text files to CRT console screen for operator 
viewing.   More than one file may be viewed sequentially, skipped, with screen 
wordwrap if line length exceeds screen width.
PATH      Allows display and dynamic change of command-file search path.
PRINT     The  PRINT command provides full page printing of text files on  the 
printer.   CPSEL  selects  the  printer  characteristics.   Page  heading  and 
numbering, and sequential file printing, with wordwrap, are available.
PROTECT   Files are declared Read-Only,  System,  or Read-Write, singularly or 
in wild-card file groups, with PROTECT.
PUBLIC    Utility  to declare directories global,  files accessible  from  any 
directory.
PWD       The PWD command Prints the names of available Working Directories.
QUIET     Entering  QUIET  reduces  text output from certain  crucial  utility 
programs, CD, LDR, LX, PATH, REG.
REN       Renaming  files  is  performed with resident REN or  with  the  more 
powerful transient RENAME.
SAK       Strike Any Key is interactive glue, used in command lines to suspend 
execution for a specified time or cancel next operation,  alert operator  with 
console bell, cancel, or if operator not available, proceed after delay.
SFA       Set file attributes:   read-write,  read-only,  archive,  wheel byte 
write-protected, etc.  Wild card file declaration permitted.
SETFILE   Allows  declaring up to four system file names to be used with shell 
programs, MENU, VMENU, SAK, ALIAS, etc.  SHOW indicates system files active.
SH        Model  shell program ready-to-use;  internal commands  are:   ?  for 
help,  SHCMT for comment entry,  SHECHO for message text echo,  and SHEXIT for 
exiting the shell.
SHCTRL    Shell  Control permits getting out of a  shell,  i.e.,  popping  the 
stack.
SHOW      SHOW  prints a menu of options to permit recalling the status of the 
ZCPR3 environment.   Buffer address locations, command line length, system cpu 
speed,  maximum  drive  and  user  areas  permitted,  all  on  11  screens  of 
information.  SHOW E<cr> installs Show as an error handler.
SHSET     Makes  any  program  into a shell;  useful  to  control  application 
program usage.
UNERASE   The  UNERASE command permits recovering accidentally  erased  files. 
Recovery must be made before starting any further disk drive activities.
VFILER    VFILER   is  Z-System  screen-oriented  file  manipulation  utility.
Permits  pointing  to files in directory and performing  operations  on  them: 
compute lengths,  view,  print,  copy,  delete,  unsqueeze, or tag (wild cards 
allowed)  for  group (mass) processing.   Ten macro commands from  custom  CMD 
menu, new CMD per directory possible.
VTYPE     File  scanning utility permits forward and reverse text viewing with 
controlled scrolling rate,  string searches, quick goto bottom and top of file 
movements, etc.  Fully screen oriented with built-in in-context command help.
WHEEL     WHEEL  permits  changing the system from  secure  to  unsecure.   If 
secure,  passwords  are  needed to access established directories and  certain 
utilities may not be used:  ALIAS, MKDIR, PUBLIC, etc.  The preset password is 
SYSTEM.
XDIR      The  XDIR command is most powerful of three supplied file  directory 
listing programs (transients).   Optionally shows all files in all directories 
(normal and public),  vertically or horizontally sorted by file name or  type, 
to console,  printer, or file.  Negate wild-card search and directory-to-file-
buffer for directory comparisons are unique features.
XIF       Exit  (terminate)  all  pending conditionals (IFs) in  flow  command 
testing.  Useful in ZEX GOTO loops.
ZEX       Extended command processor for versatile multi-command/program batch 
processing; interactive, user-prompts and message displays.

Quack  Separated From Duck.   We WONDER who will be first to use  Wyse  WY-350 
color  ASCII  terminal to upgrade WordStar into a multi-hued  word  processor. 
With  a little software modifications to the program buffer area,  color could 
be  used  to indicate status of text entries and  changes.   Different  shades 
could represent 1) original text,  2) moved text,  3) newly inserted or added, 
4) bolded or shadowed,  5) underlined,  6) font style changed,  7) text copied 
from or written to another file.  We can think of many other enhancements that 
would  be  valuable to console operators using PropStar (see  Z-News  304)  to 
post-process WordStar files into a laser marking machine.
     How do we overcome, justify cost of color terminal?
     Straight-line  drawing ability of modern ASCII terminals,  monochrome  or 
multi-color,  permits  sharp,  graceful menus to be formed--we simply  haven't 
taken advantage of graphics,  yet.   And sadly, vast crowds these days go only 
for bit-mapped monitors.  We WONDER why!

MOSART.    November BYTE MOSART (modem  synchronous,  asynchronous,  receiver,

FLASH.    S-100 board using Hitachi HD64180 high-integration chip announced by 
Magnum Digital,  Inc.,  Route #2,  Box 223,  Stover,  MO 65078,  314/377-4419. 
Unusual  (perhaps  unique) CPU board may be either master or slave  in  multi-
user/processor system.   On-board are two serial ports,  64k to 256k-bytes  of 
static CMOS RAM,  but co-board extends to 2 megabytes, I/O port drop-out timer 
for  fail-safe operation,  bus controller for multi-processing,  and many more 
features.   Priced at $469.00 with support software;  call Mr. Dion Vaugh, MDI 
President, for additional details.

Industry  Brief.    Five (5) Japanese companies are  currently  sampling  one-
megabit DRAMs; Hitachi, Toshiba, NEC, Fujitsu, and Mitsubishi.  The sixth, Oki 
Electric,  starts next month.   Toshiba has licensed Siemens (Regensburg, West 
Germany) to produce their design.   (Remember,  you read it here first.)  Many 
British  people  say,  "We  will  not change our life style  to  compete  with 
Japanese industry."  We say to these,  "Your life style can only be maintained 
if you adapt to your changing environment.   World is effectively smaller  and 
more  accessible  now then when you were philosophically (politically)  Number 
One."  What do USAians say?   Let's hear from matter releasing energy, from s-
u-b-s-t-a-n-c-e moving towards e-s-s-e-n-c-e!
     By  the Way,  third force of triad active in Cosmos,  in case  you  still 
WONDER,  is represented by instability.  This force is like a wedge applied at 
a tangent,  never orthogonally,  near an object's base.   Such directed energy 
permits,  causes  local and Cosmic change (see logo/eagle discussion in Z-News 
303,  pg 5.)  Anyone care to label this particular force?   Historically, it's 
been called by many names!
     Now we taste Zinfandel wine and hear zydeco music, that marvelous mixture 
of French,  Cajun,  Creole,  Celtic,  and African rhythms.  Real people-music, 
this zydeco! Brought to our attention long ago, we believe in 1953, by Clifton 
Chenier  (king of the music),  but made popular by Ida Guillory  (Queen  Ida). 
Chris Strachwitz,  of Berkeley radio station KPFA fame and founder of Arhoolie 
Records of El Cerrito, CA, 415/525-7471, records and produces zydeco pressings
