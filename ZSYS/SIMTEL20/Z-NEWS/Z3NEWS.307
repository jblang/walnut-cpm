Z  TIPS.   PUBLIC ZRDOS Plus,  the only DOS,  Version 1.2 (Item 12 on EI price 
list), we currently offer, comes with many useful utilities; DUMP and MOVE are 
two.   DUMP is a screen oriented file display program showing both in hex  and 
ASCII.   Trailing  options permit line addresses relative to 100 hex,  sending 
display  to printer,  pause after declared number of sectors are  shown.   Any 
keypress continues the display for next set of sectors.   Ideal for us is DUMP 
fn.ft  /p2m<cr>  which  displays  two sectors  (a  screen  full)  showing  the 
addresses starting at 100h.   DUMP is a modern utility in line with rest of Z-
System tools, in vain of COMP, our file comparator.
     MOVE,  Z-System utility written by ZRDOS author,  Dennis Wright,  as were 
DUMP,  VTYPE,  COMP,  and others,  is handy even though PUBLIC directories are 
available.   Files  are moved from area to area on the same drive,  and  moved 
quickly!   MOVE  permits wildcard filename declarations and also directory  DU 
and DIR forms.
     ZRDOS Plus comes with above four utilities plus VTYPE,  the absolute best 
file scanner we've seen (see Z-News 207,  middle of pg 1); PUBLIC described in 
Z-News 305;  VIEW, earlier file scanner; and DFA and SFA, display and set file 
attributes,  covering all available bits,  archive,  wheel-byte write-protect, 
read-only, etc.
     Two  screen-oriented command-line editors are currently available.   VCED 
(video command  editor),  Version  1.1,  written by Paul  Pomerleau  (Chicago, 
IL),   permits  editing,   executing,   and  recalling commands  lines,   both 
present and previous.    Uses subset of WordStar cursor commands (like  VERROR 
and TALIAS),   plus many more,   to move from command to command,  undo erased 
commands,   recall  previous  command,  etc.   Screen oriented and a  Z-System 
utility,  it knows about paths,  DIRs and DUs,  and ENV files.   A neat   VCED 
support   program,   WAIT,   toggles "Strike Any Key" prompt to  hold   screen 
display, as desired, before returning to editor.
     Paul has also finished his version of ALIAS, called BALIAS, to join other 
alias generators and editors (VALIAS and TALIAS) in the stable.
                        HSH (command line History SHell),  Version 1.1,  comes 
                   from  Michael  Rubenstein,   Galveston,   TX,  and  carries 
                   command-line editing to elegant heights.   Similar to  VCED 
     sketch        but with a different flavor.  Designed to be used primarily 
       of          with RAM or fast hard disks and written in C Language, HSH, 
   mad hatter      is 8k-bytes long.   Comes with Z-System HLP file;  it's one 
   with quote      nice tool!  On Z-Nodes, everywhere.
                        Wilson  Bent (Fair Haven,  NJ) has made an interesting 
"...never be       contribution  with his LDSK  named-directory  program.   By 
without your       using  leading  dash in a file name the  directory  becomes 
tools."            that  name.   Try  it--you  may find LDSK to  your  liking, 
                   especially  if  you're floppy-based.   Compare  with  MKDIR 
                   described below...many ways to de-scale fish!
     Our  cup  overflows,  cornucopia!   Thanks,  all,  for  your  programming 
activities.

We_Get_Letters.   Yes, we erred in Z-News 304; WSPATCH is still useful even if 
running  PUBLIC  ZRDOS.   It's quicker to use WSPATCH for  numerous  different 
terminals  than  to  re-install using MicroPro INSTALL.   Thanks  to  all  for 
pointing this out.
     "Your  Newsletters  and  the BYTE articles on  the  HD64180  rekindle  my 
interest in expanding my knowledge of Assembly,  ZCPR3,  etc.--even though all 
this is likely to be of little practical use to me."  Edward W.  King, Ithaca, 
NY,  writes of his stimulation and doubt.   Ed,  any knowledge can be put into 
practice.   Knowledge acquired from ZCPR3 activities goes a long way to making 
one feel fulfilled.  Such work always pays coin.
     From  James Couts,  Sunnyvale,  CA,  "I am running CP/M and am trying  to 
resist MS-DOS."  What's to resist?   There's so much to be learned, if you get 
past surface barrier, from capabilities of 8-bit machines.  Using and studying 
Z-System opens learning portals wide.

Z-Node Activity.   Central had first birthday (10 October)!   One year old, Z-
Node #1 Sysop,  David McCord,  has enlivened high-performance 8-bit computing. 
His substantial leadership produces light when there is near darkness.   Dave, 
keep your beacon on.
     All  Z-Nodes  carry  tremendous traffic loads--we thank  each  sysop  for 
extraordinary  efforts  on  Z-System community's behalf--what  a  constructive 
team!   Individually  each of us receive as we  give,  occasionally  receiving 
seven (7) fold.  Coming year holds much opportunity for hard-working teams!

Amateur  Z  User's  Corner.    MKDIR  is  used  to  create  and  modify  named 
directories.   Though ZCPR3: The Manual (pages 65, 244, 299) is somewhat vague 
about  doing this,  MKDIR's complete built-in menus and prompts make using  it 
easy and fast.  After typing MKDIR<cr> at command line, enter ? (or /) at tool 
command prompt to obtain main menu:

      MKDIR Command (? for Help)? []
      MKDIR Commands are --
               C - Change Directory (Add/Rename/Delete Entries)
               I - Initialize Directory
               P - Print Directory
               R - Read Directory
               S - Status of MKDIR Environment
               W - Write Directory File
               X - Exit Program
      MKDIR Command (? for Help)? []

First thing to do,  if modifying an existing NDR file, is read file into auto-
allocated  buffer  space provided and then display contents,  R followed by  P 
command.  After entering R, choose name of NDR to edit or create.  The default 
is  NAMES.NDR.   We  distribute a sample NDR file with name  of  SYS.NDR.   If 
updating  this  file and if it's located in  A15:ROOT  directory,  then  enter 
A15:SYS.NDR<cr> as requested name at R command prompt.
     After  entering  P and seeing what you already have as  names  associated 
with disk/user areas, enter C to alter.  And press ? (or /) for this screen:

      MKDIR Change Mode --
            You may issue the following commands at this point:
                    DU:dirname     <--- Create/Rename DIR Entry
                    DU:            <--- Delete DIR Entry
                    <RETURN>       <--- Print Directory
                    X              <--- Exit [leave Change Mode]
                    ?              <--- Print this Help
      Directory Entry (?<RETURN> for Help)? []

Establish  disk  A,   user  area  6,  with  name  of  "private"  by  entering: 
A6:PRIVATE<cr>.   Next, prompt asks for optional password, up to 8 characters, 
to access directory.
     You take it from here...create and load (using LDR.COM) several trial NDR 
files to gain experience (and confidence) using named directories.  After, you 
are ready to write ST alias files used by CD (please,  read pages 23 and 24 of 
Z3 Manual).   Are you ready?   Can you sense this long-expected moment, never-
to-be-repeated opportunity?

Ramblings.    (We  don't  do what we think we must,  but what  we  must;  that 
written is less important than that not.)
     You've  read and heard of robots (maybe seen or even used  one),  drones, 
and  cyborgs  (cybernetic organisms).   It would be surprise to find  we  were 
actually one of these.   But think, what makes us what we are?  It's not flesh 
and blood, bone and skin, or overall form.  Sure, these are aspects of what we 
are, but there's more.  What constitutes the Whole?
     Ponder mass of data and information we presently have access to.   If you 
live in a large city,  your local public library has more books than you could 
read in a hundred lifetimes.   One of these days soon, all this printed matter 
could  be  in  computer  memories,  perhaps be  readable  with  your  personal 
computer.   But neither data nor facts count for much unless you have means to 
interpret  into knowledge and understanding,  get to the  whole.   We  predict 
"desktop  publishing"  mostly  adds quantity to  printed-text  equation,  does 
little for quality,  depth and breadth, does little for substance.  Unless we, 
individually and as a species, take a longer view of existence we simply march 
in-place;  each octave overlays exactly the previous.  You know Being, living, 
and learning rests squarely with you and me.  Manikins we be not!
     Is  not the same alphabet used to form words,  sentences that  praise  as 
well  as damn?   The octave-oriented musical scale provides for production  of 
sound-combinations to make us both rejoice and weep.  For every good there's a 
countering evil--yin,  yang; substantial universal stability in Cosmos.  Third 
Force,  neither female nor male, we think of...for every student there already 
exists a teacher.  From knowledge, let's rise to next level of understanding.
     You,  think quality not quantity...each action, each thought has profound 
local  and Cosmic consequences.   Waste not a moment with thoughts of greed or 
hurtfulness.   We  humans  are still quite coarse,  with much to  be  refined. 
Let's get on with our mutual task of learning!   Be not paralyzed,  but be  on 
the Way to deep living, a norm of all Life; this alone wears well.
     We  camp currently on a mountain top to pen these ramblings.   We live at 
home,  though  like  a traveler on the road...find many things that  each  day 
teach  us.   Fools there are that think their El Dorado is anywhere but  where 
they live.   But who keeps book on such folly.   We're here searching for that 
seemingly lost,  to change our mood,  to taste of water turned into wine  from 
stone...

From  light and darkness,  strength and weakness;  heaven and hell,  truth and 
falseness,  real  and unreal;  from the crown of thorns and the bed of  roses, 
from  the  depths of agony and the heights of sublime  joy;  from  hate  (both 
positive and negative), destitution, despair, and destruction and love, faith, 
hope,  and construction:   we_offer a document we want you to own.   We cannot 
give it to you (though we wish we could);  you must have worked for it.   Thus 
we  charge money,  money which represents (see Z-News 305,  all of pg 5)  your 
past time and effort (labor,  energy).   The document, a pearl of great prize, 
is economy-priced at exactly $100.00.  But we return half your money if, after 
reading  it seven (7) times as detailed in Z-News 302,  top three-fifths of pg 
3,  you  feel it not worth amount paid.   Make no judgments,  simply  read  as 
detailed in 302.   Think!   can you do these two things:  read seven times and 
not  judge.   If so,  order WONDER:   Lesson Learning to receive something  we 
trust you absorb and retain.
     WONDER is not for everyone--only for those who are dissatisfied with pre-
sent ways of looking at,  seeing things--is for those who are anxious to learn 
new Ways,  to discard unsatisfactory.   Please, do not order WONDER unless you 
expect  the  unexpected...think  thrice before ordering.   See  you  down  the 
lines...
