Z  TIPS:   Members of Florida's Tampa Bay Computer  User's  Group 
(Ron Schwabel,  Charlie Hoffman,  Joe Griffith,  David Hunt,  and 
Steve Kapplin) have made an improvement to Z3INS.   They modified 
Z3INS  by  adding the ability to install one COM file  simply  by 
using  its full name (fn.COM) as trailing parameter,  instead  of 
the fn.INS file name, usually ZCPR3.INS.  What a nice convenience 
feature  being  able  to  add only one file at  a  time  to  your 
environment!   Of  course ZCPR3.INS could be edited and new  file 
added to the list, or a new one-file list created, but just using 
Z3INS11 is so quick, simple, if but one file is being installed.
     Joe  Wright  (EI  team member,  San  Jose,  California)  has 
extended  the  features  of  DIR to  include  both  vertical  and 
horizontal  sorted file listings and increased the  maximum  file 
sizes  accurately displayed from 512k-bytes to full  8-megabytes.  
Also  he  has added screen highlighting to separate file  columns 
and disk statistics.   Its capability fits in-between the present 
transients DIR and XD.  You find it your favorite--give it a try.
     Dave Lucky (Crescendo Systems, Pleasant Hill, California) is 
latest  programmer to fix LDR.COM (we thought it was fully  fixed 
months  ago,  but we were wrong).   LDR12 moves us one more  step 
towards perfection.  Thanks Dave for getting us up a ladder-rung.  
(These heights can dizzy!)
     Peter  Lyman (of JPL,  Pasadena,  California) has  indicated 
troubles  with  CLEANDIR when using really big  disks  with  huge 
directories.   The  problem  occurs when there is not enough  RAM 
space to hold all the disk directory file names at once;  problem 
usually  starts at over 1024 names (32 bytes per  name),  48k-TPA 
permits  about  1500 directory files  before  trouble.   His  fix 
allows  user to realize situation and not proceed unless desired.  
Upgraded  program  is called CLNDR11P;  it  and  extended  DIR11, 
LDR12, and Z3INS11 are on ZCPR3 bulletin board at 415/489-9005.

Good News:   Corporations,  OEM's  and VAR's are signing  up  for 
volume  usage  of  Echelon software.   Thanks to  William  Dollar 
(Ampro  Computers),   Allan  Levy  and  Keith   Milligan,   Hetra 
Corporation),  David  Lucky  (Crescendo Systems),  Terry  Stanley 
(DataCom Systems),  Graham Campbell (Innovative  Networks),  Paul 
Jones  (National Public Domain Software Rental  Center),  Bridger 
Mitchell  (PluPerfect  Systems),  J.D.  Wasson (Ford  Aerospace), 
Robert  Richard (Systems Peripherals Consultants)  for  obtaining 
licenses  from us.   We see vibrant life entering 8-bit  hardware 
because of new features,  economy,  efficiency,  and ease of  use 
provided by Echelon Lasting-Value Software offerings.
     More  good news:   Sol Libes and Dave Hardy,  from erstwhile 
Microsystems  magazine,  are doing columns for  Micro  Cornucopia 
magazine  (P.O.  Box 223,  Bend,  OR 97709,  503/382-8048).   Sol 
writes  about public domain software and Dave continues with  his 
S-100  bus column.   More journalistic power moving from east  to 
west!   We eagerly wait for Micro C's arrival, now that these two 
have joined David Thompson, journal's Editor and Publisher.
     More:   ZRDOS  (BDOS  replacement)  is  shipping,  ahead  of 
schedule!   Presently  being added to Z3-Dot-Com, becoming Z-Com, 
is  available for an additional $49.50 to those who have  already 
obtained Z3-Dot-Com from us.  (See price list of 7 January 1985.)

Echelon   announces   complete  operating  system   and   support 
utilities.   Combining ZCPR3 and ZRDOS produces powerful computer 
software called Z-System.   Z is uniquely competent collection of 
programs  developed by individuals who care about  resource  (RAM 
and disk space, processor throughout) management, efficiency, and 
economy.   We  are concerned with aesthetic as well as  pragmatic 
solutions to coding:   functional routines,  yes!   But also keep 
track  of  everything  in  easy,  elegant  ways--a  leap  towards 
creative  stimulation.   We  break that conventional  set,  avoid 
time-worn  and  obvious  answers  that are  so  boring  and  non-
stimulating.

Z-SYSTEM SUPPORT UTILITIES:  Echelon software development  system 
(complementing   operating   system)   utilities  (Z-Tools)  were 
authored by a special group of people we wish you to  know.   All 
encourage  writing efficient (non-high level language) structured 
code for 8-bit microprocessors.   (This group is welcomed by  our 
corporate  staff,  as  well as by now-famous triad of Joseph  and 
Dennis Wright and Richard Conn--we work with purpose,  in harmony 
for high productivity!  (SDS tools make for efficient application 
program writing, re-writing, with or without source code.)
     1.  Patrick  O'Connell  - relocating  Z80  macro  assembler, 
generates Microsoft compatible REL files or Intel compatible  HEX 
files,  compatible  with  DRI  macro  assemblers  MAC  and  RMAC, 
generates  DRI  compatible  SYM  files,  handles  complete  Zilog 
mnemonics,   INCLUDE  and  MACLIB  files,  conditional  assembly, 
separate  data,   program,   common  and  absolute  memory  space 
allocation,  with  linker and library manager for REL files;  and 
over  three  times faster than Macro-80  (M80).   Delivered  with 
8080-to-Z80 mnemonic converter and 55-page loose leaf instruction 
manual.  All for $95.00!
     2.  Robert  Doolittle - debugging and translation of  Intel, 
Zilog,  and CDL/TDL mnemonics;  debugger sells for $50.00, set of 
four translators for $40.00.   Single break-point, patching, etc.  
Intel to Zilog, Zilog to Intel, Intel to TDL, TDL to Intel covers 
full range of possibilities.  (Additional pseudo-ops easily added 
by  user.)   Write code  using  Intel  mnemonics,  convert,  then 
assemble   with   Patrick's  super  fast  Z80  relocating   macro 
assembler.
     3.  Al  Hawley - program disassembling for  $90.00;  easily, 
easiest-to-use  disassembler available on  the  planet.   Handles 
byte (DB) and word (DW) data, disassembles object code up to 64k-
bytes long,  comments may be inserted during disassembly. Command 
set provides interactive disassembly, command strings and macros, 
online help,  calculations in any number base,  flexible file and 
I/O  control.   Remember  when you didn't have source code for  a 
file:   Resource was used to disassemble,  first to come out  and 
was good;  Dasm,  came next and was better; but today Al's REVAS3 
is best!
     4. John Otken - screen oriented symbolic debugging sells for 
$195.00.   Operates  with four major and two minor windows,  each 
independent of the other.  Instruction, cpu registers, stack, and 
memory are displayed in major windows;  command line and  message 
echo  area  occupy  minor.   Two  additional  temporary  displays 
contain help and the breakpoints. Utility provides both real time 
and  simulation  (control  never passed  to  program)  debugging!  
Comes with carefully written 53-page loose leaf manual.
     Our 8-bit seriousness is fully indicated by breath and depth 
of activities.   Counter-revolutions are fun to observe, but even 
more so if you take part; will you?

Bulletin  Board System becomes Z-Node:  West coast tied  together 
with  Z-System  electronic  bulletin  boards.    Al  Hawley  (Los 
Angeles)  and David McCord (Fremont) join operations and transfer 
data  from north California (NOCAL) to south  (SOCAL),  and  vice 
versa!   Al's  modem number is 213/670-9465.   Much is planned to 
expand  Z-Node  national,  international,  coverage.   Sysops  of 
presently  functioning RCP/M's wishing to become a Z-Node  please 
let us know; full details promptly supplied.

Software  Domain  Status  Explained:   There  is  some  confusion 
relative to the status of programs Discat, Z3-Dot-Com, and ZRDOS.  
We  have  been informed of some of these files being  put  up  on 
RCP/M  systems.   Such action is illegal!   We wish to make clear 
meaning of public domain,  copyrighted,  and limited distribution 
programs.
     ZCPR3  and  its utilities are released for  private  use  by 
individuals  in  non-commercial  environments.   This  is  called 
limited or restricted distribution.  You cannot sell ZCPR3 or any 
of  the utilities without first obtaining a license from Echelon.  
All are copyrighted;  copyrights have been assigned to Echelon by 
Richard  Conn.    Owner  of program copyright  determines  domain 
status by whatever restrictions are placed at release.
   The  legal  definition  of "public  domain"  is:  you  may  do 
anything you wish--sell,  give away, modify, do anything.   ZCPR3 
is  not  in  the  public domain;  you cannot sell  it  without  a 
license.   Presently  three  programs (with many  more  to  come, 
Term3, Emsg, Change Control Manager, etc.) are not to be uploaded 
to the RCP/M network or traded among individual users,  are under 
strict  license agreement:  Discat,  Z3-Dot-Com and ZRDOS.  These 
programs  may be purchased only from Echelon.  The COM files  are 
named:  CATCHECK,  CATERASE, CATFREE, CATMAKE, CATMERGE, CATNAME, 
CATRMDSK,  CATSCAN,  CATUPD,  Z3L, AC (archive copy), VIEW, COMP, 
DUMP,   SFA,   and  DFA;  and  the  special  files  are  ENV.SPR, 
SYSFCP.SPR,   Z3BIO.SPR,  Z3CPR.SPR,  Z3MOV.BIN,  and  ZRDOS.HEX.  
These will never be released to SIG/M or public message networks.  
These are programs to keep Echelon alive, making money, with some 
of  that  money going to  Richard  Conn,  Joseph  Wright,  Dennis 
Wright, and others to follow.
     Please guard our rights...if we don't stay in business there 
will   be   no  more  ZCPR3's  or  enhancements  or  ZRDOS's   or 
applications taking special advantage of Z- System capability. We 
are practically giving the software away now, not making much off 
each package. Come and join in our deep-support of 8-bit computer 
(downward compatible with CP/M-80) world,  an important,  furtile 
world many so quickly abandoned!

           Now, we ask all those who have obtained ZCPR3
            and its utilities from RCP/M's, or SIG/M,
  (estimated, over 10,000) and have found the collection to be
       useful, helpful in learning structured programming,
                   in improving and automating
   microcomputer operations, please financially support us by
       sending $35.00 (user-supported free-ware concept).  
      You will receive one-year subscription to fortnighter
     newsletter (Z-News) and written or telephone assistance
         we can provide.  If you like what we are doing
 compensate labor and material we have directly (or indirectly)
             given you--monetarily keep us healthy!
       As Hindus would say, "It's good Karma."  Thank you.

Wyse Technology (San Jose,  California) adds WY-85:  New terminal 
is  DEC VT-220 compatible,  and emulates VT-100 along with  VT-52 
and  ANSI  Z3.64 codes;  sells for only $799.00 and  has  similar 
mechanical  features of WY-50 (TVI 920/925 compatible) and  WY-75 
(VT-100 compatible):  80/132-column display,  solid keyboard  and 
14" green screen.  Wyse continues to impress!

Running  a business with IBM your competitor is on road to  near-
certain bankruptcy.   IBM has shown their desire to not only be a 
part  of  microcomputers  but  to dominate  all  aspects  of  the 
marketplace!    Remember,   this   is  the  company  that  fought 
distributed  processing tooth-and-nail in favor of one  mainframe 
computer.   Our approach to such monoliths (modern-day  Goliaths) 
is  to simply not approach;  move away,  do something  different; 
find  a  path,  a way to our place of usefulness--that's what  we 
presently do.
     Any  entity  having status to set  de  facto  standards,  no 
matter  what  it  offers,  also possesses mind-numbing  power  to 
stifle imagination,  reduce available product diversity, suppress 
innovation  and creativity!   Permission for and access  to  such 
power comes from their customers--what does that tell us? We deal 
with cosmic,  race-heritage forces.  (Besides, we felt dreadfully 
common  when  last we used an IBM PC,  but perhaps we  think  too 
much.  Better be robotic, not think at all?  What do you think?)

                  What are we, Oh! mighty man,
                We who fall even while we stand?
            We who, if we can, grab an Infinite hand.
                 And with help, again we stand.

See you down the lines...
