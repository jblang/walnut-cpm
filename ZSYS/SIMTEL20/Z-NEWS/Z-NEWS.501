BPrinter.    Long  wait is over--BPrinter ships, EI Price List  Item  41,  our 
print despooler.  It prints even during heavy disk accesses--other  despoolers 
don't.  BPrinter is ideal for RAM and hard disk based systems.  It is easy  to 
use  and adheres to Z-System segment and tool philosophy.  But you  must  have 
I/O Package installed in your BIOS (Micromint's SB180 does) or be using Z-Com, 
Price  List  Items 5 and 6.  All who ordered should have received it  by  now.
(Item  84,  ZCPR3 and IOPs tutorial written by Richard Conn,  sells  for  only 
$9.95, shows how to modify your BIOS for Z-style I/O redirection.)

More  Benchmarks  and the Future.   Programs Bench 1, 2, and 3  from  Micro  C 
magazine  (Z-News 409) compiled with Software Toolworks C/80  produce  quicker 
running  code than does Manx Aztec C.  But clearly these programs are  more  a 
test  of  compiler design than of computer throughput.  Furthermore,  it  also 
should be clear programs for high-performance 8-bit systems should be coded in 
Assembly Language--ZCPR3: The Libraries, Item 82 at $29.95 from EI Price List, 
shows  how  easy  it is.   Aztec is acceptable if custom  link  libraries  are 
written  for it, as Tim Gary did for Z-Msg.  Assembler loop, compare, and  I/O 
functions run two to six times quicker; math routines have not been worked out 
yet.    
     With 38,400 baud ASCII terminals, 5.2 seconds is lower limit for Bench 3.
(First  76,800  baud terminal appears soon?)  Notice  only  Assembler  permits 
achieving  it.  C/80 comes close.  Screen painting, updating is  important  if 
doing word and text processing.  Also essential, good quality screen  display, 
e.g., quality offered by Wyse 50+ and TeleVideo 955.  (Benchmark programs  are 
on Z-Nodes as file BENCH01.LBR.)

Š     Using WordStar 3.0 (vi if Unix machine), "Save" benchmark is obtained  by 
adding time-to-save to disk value, in seconds, 68k-byte SCAN.EI text file  (Z-

Divide by two to obtain average.
     A  C Language compiler written especially for Hitachi HD64180  would  put 
results  for this chip in truly superior class.  Enhancements planned for  ZAS 
assembler makes 64180 even better than it is now.
     RAM  disk  versus  program  memory  space  (TPA)  philosophy--many  small 
coordinated files allocated memory, i.e., loaded, versus single large program.
Quickly  locating  files  through OS file structure versus  code  segments  by 
vector?  Speed and flexibility of each approach, that's the trade.  When we no 
longer  have to consider sluggish magnetic disk accesses, our software  design 
procedures change.  (Term3 and Discat designs are fully justified, because  of 
increased flexibility offered, even without RAM disks.)
     Operating  systems generally were not designed with abundant fast  memory 
in  mind.  Unix and later, CP/M 1.4, considered 16k-bytes of "core"  as  their 
starting  points; CP/M 2.2, 20k-bytes.  Now, these limited  memory  structures 
don't  seem  appropriate  when megabytes of inexpensive and  fast  memory  are 
available and online.
     After  using RAM-disk machines for sometime now, conscious of  costs  and 
reliability  factors, we suggest getting hard disks out of our  small  desktop 
super  microcomputers--like  Oneac did--and using only RAM  main  memory  with 
battery  and removable floppy disks (Kodak) for back-up.  Think--it  means  no 
more cold booting.  Big ROMs and PROMs go away.  One-time boot, load Z-System, 
load  utilities, and one-time load application programs--that's it.   Save  to 
high-density floppy--forget hard disks of less than 30-megabytes.  (Z-News 502 
tells  of  DT42--it handles 76,800 baud terminals, even  153,600  and  beyond; 
future  is now!)  Leave AC power on at all times, auto-turnoff of  CRT  screen 
after  20 minutes of non-use, no moving parts except for floppy  drive  during 
actual  back-up  operations.  Such machines are always ready, ready  when  you 
are.  Ideal!

Z-System  Site  License Policy.   Simple policy which we think  fair  and 
     reasonable.   No  big deal many companies make it.  You  pay  retail 
     price  for  the  first copy of program and 20% of  retail  for  each 
     additional copy you wish to use on-site, up to 15 copies.  Above  15 
     copies, price drops to 15% of retail, 85% discount.  You do  program 
     disk  copying.   You receive one set  of  applicable  documentation.  
     More  sets  are  purchased at volume discount  rates  shown  on  our 
     current  Price List.  Example: six copies of program are  twice  the 
     price  of one.  Five sets of additional documentation are  purchased 
     at  25% discount, i.e., 75% of retail; 50 sets, 33%; 250,  40%.   So 
     what's the big deal?  (No site license or runtime fees required  for 
     Quick-Task (tm), use it on as many computers and for as many jobs as 
     you  choose.  But each physical site or corporate division  requires 
     one master license costing only $249.00.)

     Zilog becomes second source for Hitachi HD64180 high-integration super 8-
bit   chip.    Slightly  modified  design--Z180   it's   called--offers   full 
compatibility  with  all  Z80 support peripherals.   It  provides  "an  upward 
migration path to the Z800" scheduled for shipping this calendar quarter.  Can 
you believe it?  Zilog's Alan Hamilton, Director of Component Marketing, tells 
us  to.  The Z180, we believe; Z800, we believe when we have one in hand.   In 
Z-News 207, page 5, we hoped HD64180 is called either H180 or Z180.
     ON!  computer  from  Oneac (Z-News 408) is one  outstanding  machine,  an

Styling:  so  good-looking, engaging.  And machine doesn't  waste  your  time.
Never  have to cold-boot, it's always ready to be used and it's here,  so  get 
it--you  don't  have  to buy IBM or Apple to run  your  small-to-medium  sized 
business--your  secretary  will respect you more; your bottom-line  will  show 
better, because of increased productivity, hers and others of your staff.  And 
why use a DEC VAX or an IBM PC host to develop target 8080/8085, Z80,  NSC800, 
or HD64180 code when ON! using Quick-Task, ZAS and ZLINK is so much faster and 
more  efficient?   Office or lab, it's up to you!  Others have  wrought,  have

Common Ground.   Many feel offended--you know who you are--by being  requested 
to  read  everything  seven  (7) times (Z-News 302,  page  3).   Technique  as 
explained  is  basis  for Western concept of study.   Without  study  learning 
occurs slowly.  Why are we as we are?  We learn so slowly, if at all.  Most of 
us  are  born, spend years on planet, die, and: so what!  We die  as  we  were 
born--no  soul  developed  beyond that passed  genetically  to  us.   LEARNING 
REQUIRES  GREAT  EFFORT!  Work (study) concerns, is about learning.   We  only 
think we learn if we but go through the motion.  (We speak now on non-physical 
level.)   Give  it a try...read, study something thoroughly,  completely,  and 
feel new understanding.  Do it!  What can we lose?

Of  Cabbages and Kings.   Words have power.  Many have questioned our  use  of 
data, information, knowledge, and understanding, a virtual word pyramid.   And 
grasped not notion of reality and dimensions.  (If shoe fits, wear it even  if 
pinching!  Truth, sweet to the taste, is bitter in the stomach.)
     Move from one word to another and feel mental and emotional change as you

     Reality  is  relative; to think we capable of imagining  it  absolute  is 
illusion.   (Any  concept  we  have of God, infinity,  is  also  relative  and 
subjective,  thus fickled.  If the majority agrees with us it  becomes  solid-
fact, but majorities do not determine reality.)  Reality changes to new levels 
as  our subjective position changes; changes occur as we more fully  integrate 
experience  with  data, information,  knowledge,  understanding.   Integration 
involves perceiving, adapting, assimilating, blending, extending dimensions to 
higher  levels,  to  higher limits.  Levels and limits change,  expand  as  we 
learn,  as  we  grow, as we live; integration  (integrity)  further  involves, 
requires getting control, Control, and finally CONTROL. 
     Reality  is something neither derivative nor dependent but exists of  and 
by itself--is fundamental and essential existence.  Dimensions give measure to 
existence,  spatial extensions starting with thought, moving into less  mobile 
substances.   As  more  dimensions are  perceived,  approaching  infinity  but 
simultaneously curving back to zero, freedom increases, fewer laws are active-
-reality  less relative, approaches Absolute.  Then human thought soars as  if 
equipped with gossamer wings of magic eagles!  Another outpouring:

                   Dimensions:  extent     size        measurements
                                height     length      width
                                aspect     scope       magnitude
                   Reality:     firm       solid       having existence
                                original   true        state of being
                                genuine    authentic   state of thinking
                                material   corporeal   substantial   absolute

     (Above  and  below were composed in response to  Byron  McBride,  Michael 
Durant,  among  a dozen others.  Though these words fall as  water  on  desert 
plants,  soon  evaporating, some computerists find them useful, just  as  such 
plants need little water for growth and flowering.) 
     Our reality, altered as our perception, as our being moves from level  to 
level,  is  wholly subjective.  The word objective, applied at  times  to  the 
absolute  we think we achieve or understand, means an absolute;  striving  for 
such is a perpetual goal, seemingly .rm 42
never  achieved.   Show  us  an  objective 
human  being!  If a single one  cannot  be 
found, how can groups or organizations  of 
them exist!  We see far but not beyond the 
macro  (infinity)  frontier;  exact   same 
boundaries mark limits of the micro (zero) 
frontier.   Much  stone is  lifted  before                   SKETCH

potential   dimensions.   Our   perceptioî
point,   our  perch,  our  platform,   our 
ground, is somewhere in the middle between 
zero and infinity.  (From Z-News 304, zero 
equals    eight    equals     infinity...a 
paraphrasing  of  the Law  of  Octaves  on 
which  our  musical scale is  based.   Two 
zeros,  one  on top of the  other  is  the Šeight;  two zeros side by side,  infinity.  
Numbers  exist  without  mathematics   and 
arithmetic.)
     Build  a mental pyramid!  Start  with 
highest  level of symbolism, our  imaging: 
1)  Absolute  (All, God, Law,  unity,  the 
gods,  infinity, principle), 2)  love,  3) 
truth (wisdom), 4) ideas (mind), 5) books, 
6)  words, 7) letters of the alphabet,  8) 
neocortex  (recently  evolved  brain),  9) 
rhombencephalon  (animal or ancient brain), 10) nucleic acids,  11)  synapses, 
and  finally, 12) neurons of the brain (inviolable, sacred hardware  level)--a 
few  levels  of  comprehension  from viewpoint  of  a  newsletter  writer  and 
computerist.   Other levels could be developed representing more points  along 
the Path.
     Attempt  comprehending  a  book's  meaning  from  letters-of-the-alphabet 
level.  Concept of levels then quickly come into sharp focus.
     Remarkably, reality is a combination of perception levels containing many 
dimensions  concurrently  active  to  transmit,  communicate  harmony.   (It's 
impossible  to  pluck  a flower without affecting a galactic  star,  a  sneeze 
ricochets  amongst  the planets.)  In the world of  "hard-reality"  only  four 
dimensions exist: width, length, height, time.  In our reality, time takes  on
