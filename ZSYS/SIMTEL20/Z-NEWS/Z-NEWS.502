New   8-Bit  Computer  Boards.    New  era...super  microcomputer   board-pair 
developed by SemiDisk Systems, Inc., of Beaverton (Portland), OR.  Each  board 
is  5.75" by 8.0".  CPU board sports Hitachi HD64180 (what else?)  with  512k-
bytes of dynamic random access memory (DRAM), four RS-232 serial channels, and 
floppy disk controller (Western Digital WD2793 chip) to handle up to 8  floppy 
drives  simultaneously,  including hi-density Kodak, Mitsubishi,  and  Toshiba 
types, 8", 5.25", and 3.5".  Also included are RS-170 video monitor  interface 
(National NS455) with 80 columns by 25 lines for text and status plus keyboard 
parallel  interface, SASI channel for high speed devices, Centronics  parallel 
printer interface, and two spare 28-pin EPROM sockets (one socket can be  used 
for  realtime clock/calender, e.g., Dallas Semiconductor's SmartWatch  DS1216, 
see  Circuit Cellar, BYTE, March 1986; other for monitor personality).   Three 
serial  channels  (WD2123 Deuce chip on CPU-independent clock  and  one  64180 
channel)  run  at up to 38,400 baud with two of these capable of  153,600  and 
beyond; fourth to 19,200 (slower 64180 channel).
     Inspiration from Douglas Adams's popular book, Hitchhiker's Guide to  the 
Galaxy,  main  board  is called "Deep Thought 42."  And DT42  runs  at  up  to 
12.288mHz  clock  rates.   Uses  four-layer  printed  circuit   board--densest 
component layout we have ever seen.  Wow!
     Best and most radical news of all:  second board of board-pair,  co-board 
named "The SemiDisk", has 8 megabytes of parity-checked DRAM using 32  single-
inline-packages  (SIP  as  opposed to DIP, dual inline) made  up  of  256k-bit 
memory  chips.   Understand  this semiconductor memory  as  main  drive,  main 
storage!   Auto-backup  power comes from an  off-board  battery.   Recommended 
battery lasts 8 hours or more to keep memory refreshed if 110-volt AC power is 
not available, as in weather storm power black-outs, or for transporting  from 
one  location  to another.  Battery is always on-charge if plug  is  in  wall-
socket.  Using just becoming available 1-megabit chips (Toshiba, etc.), up  to 
32  megabytes  are  offered onboard.  Co-board  contains  full  SCSI  parallel 
channel  for  high speed communications to other devices, and  optionally,  an 
onboard  1200 bps modem for data is available.  Using improved  MOSART  module 
(Z-News  207) and CODEC chip, companding A/D and D/A in single package,  board 
additionally  provides  high-quality voice record/reply  telephone  answering-
machine service, at 5 minutes per megabyte of DRAM used!
     File transfer measures 1.6 megabytes per second, RAM to RAM!  That's over 
4  times faster than fastest small hard drives, 12 times faster  than  typical 
implementation!  From Mr. James Bell, President, "The SemiDisk offers no  time 
penalty for files which are not stored as sequential blocks, a situation which 
slows  hard  disks to a DT42 Board crawl."  What an alternative to 5-  to  30-
megabyte  hard drives!  (See Z-News 309 where we proclaimed  30-megabyte,  and 
less, hard disk drives soon to be obsolete.)

                  "PHOTO of DT42 Printed Circuit Board here
                              in printed editon"

     With  clock/calendar  option and Integrand Model 3820  cabinet,  a  Kodak 
floppy  drive  for  RAM  disk file  backup--2.7  to  10  megabytes  formatted, 
depending  on model (see Z-News 309 and 404 for more  on  embedded-servo-track 
Kodak  drives, 408 for more on RAM-disk based Oneac ON! computer), and with  a 
Teac  55B floppy drive for software transportability, SemiDisk  board-pair  is 
all we want or need for a long time to come.  And Term3 with T3SERVER/T3MASTER 
can  tie  two or more together for distributed processing, for both  wide  and 
local  area  networking.  Wow!  New era for desktop computing,  with  business Šgraphics.
     Boards  connect together either direct piggyback style (plug and  socket, 
stacked)  or  with  60-pin connectors and  cable,  for  side-by-side  layouts.
Boards  are offered with Z-System, have I/O redirection through use  of  IOPs.
Fully populated DT42 CPU board sells for $599.00 with system software ready to 
boot.   Prices  for expansion board, presently about $200.00 per  megabyte  of 
memory, soon to be $50.00, is determined by DRAM-chip density and  population, 
voice and other options.  Both boards near production status, are scheduled to 
be shipped this July.  Can you wait!  Where there is will there are ways.
     Good-bye  hard  drives  with their  noise,  unreliability,  and  relative 
slowness;  hello silicon main storage.  We always believed mechanical  devices 
should  be replaced by electronic ones whenever and wherever  possible--that's 
been history of our industry.
     But  before we float off on Cloud-9, get too carried away, let's look  at 
cost  picture,  now and future.  Optical disks, soon to  be  available,  offer 
price/storage  advantage  over hard drives and solid-state  ones.   But  don't 
forget  4-  and  16-megabit chips are only a few years away, two  to  four  if 
history  has  meaning.   They  will provide  128-  and  512-megabytes  on  our 
expansion board.  Presently, wholesale prices for 64k-bit chips are from $0.80 
to $1.20 each, and stable; 256k-bit chips, $2 to $3, with 1-megabit going  for 
over $30.00.  If trend continues, and we have every reason to believe it will, 
1-megabit chip prices fall to what 256k-bit are now.  Then our expansion board 
costs  about  $20.00 a megabyte at chip level, excluding  board  manufacturing 
cost,  or about 1/4 present price of $200.00, i.e., $50.00 per megabyte to  us 
end-users.   Certainly hard drives are being sold, as are floppies,  at  fire-
sale  prices because of over-supply, low demand.  But, in fact 96tpi  floppies 
now  are  $135.00 each, up from $89.00 of a couple of months ago.   Market  is 
simply getting in line with demand and adjusting for rising yen, 165 down from 
240 to the dollar.
     Please  notice trend.  Semiconductor RAM chip prices continually go  down 
as  density  goes up: price-per-bit is less each year.  We believe  impact  of 
recent  DRAM  dumping  penalties on Japanese  semiconductor  houses  is  short 
lived...value  is  value, product will get to us no matter  what.   Winchester 
prices   seem  bottomed-out,  unless  vertical  recording  technique   becomes 
practical.   If  that  happens, hard disks will stay  in-the-hunt  along  with 
optical  and semiconductor storage.  Optical for mass storage, Winchester  for 
intermediate,  "big"  floppy  or tape for file back-up,  RAM  for  main,  fast 
memory--no matter what storage configuration--SemiDisk board-pair handles  it.
Board-pair is that flexible!
     What  are your priorities?  It comes down to needs, wants,  price  versus 
performance:   access  speed (time is money!), acoustic noise  (who  likes  to 
listen to 3,000-rpm spindle whine all day!), space efficiency (bytes per cubic 
inch),  and most important of all, long-term reliability (who can  stand  head 
crashes every year or so!).
     SemiDisk Systems, company that invented and produced first RAM disk-drive 
emulator  for  microcomputers,  produces  fastest  (see  Z-News  409  and  501 
benchmarks)  and  most  compact  hardware we presently  know  of  for  desktop 
computers.   More information can be obtained by accessing  Oregon  CBBS/Aloha 
RAS  at  503/649-8327, password PUEBLO.  Look for message  directing  to  DT42 
file.  Or if you prefer, call SemiDisk directly, 503/626-3104, voice.
     High-performance  8-bit  microcomputer systems continue to  be  designed.
(Look  for  HD64180  replacement  board, V-Max,  for  Epson  QX-10  machines.)
Existing ones seem to never die!  On desktops, in offices, shops, and labs, in 
the fields, they are everywhere.  They spread...they, they never die!
     --------------------------------------------------------------------
Z  Tips.    VTYPE permits quick file review from your CRT,  much  faster  than 
using  an  editor or wordprocessor for scanning up and down  a  file.   Dennis ŠWright,  author  of the ZRDOS utility, used sophisticated routines  to  permit 
getting back to top of file or going to bottom of file in less than 2 seconds, 
independent of file size!  Using WordStar-like commands, you can scroll a line 
or  screen at a time in either direction.  We never use TYPE because it  can't 
reverse the scan--it's relatively primitive, non-screen oriented.
     Built-in  help  screen  can be used while scanning  a  file.   Operations 
couldn't  be simpler.  Use "/" (or "?") to be reminded of  options  available, 
during  scan  session.   As with other Z-System utilities,  VTYPE  uses  ZCPR3 
environmental  and  Z3TCAP  data  to determine  the  characteristics  of  your 
terminal.   Lines exceeding display length of your terminal are truncated.   A 
highlighted "+" is displayed at end of line to indicate this condition, as  WS 
and NW do.  The built-in menu:

                   <<<<< VTYPE, Version 2.0 >>>>>

                       Command Menu

              SCREEN COMMANDS               FIND COMMANDS

        ^T -- Go to top of file
        ^B -- Go to bottom of file     X -- Exit

Toggles permit showing WordStar embedded control codes, or alternately, the ^A 
and ^B highlighting codes of Z3.  Notice auto-scrolling, selective send text--
screen at a time and as you scroll--to printer, and locate (find)  text-string 
features.   Status line, at top of screen, tells file name and what  mode  you 
are in.  You exit VTYPE using an "X" command as with VFILER and other Z-System 
utilities.
     Next  subject.   VFILER, Version 4.0, produced  by  Good-Neighbor  Helper 
Joseph Wright, provides many new features to Richard Conn's file  manipulation 
creation  while retaining object code size of 14k-bytes.  1) Display  of  five 
columns,  18  lines, for total of 90 files per screen,  2)  highlighted  drama 
during group file copy and delete, 3) optional CRC-verify coping for  security 
or  increased speed, no-verify used if disk system is known stable,  4)  group 
file copy cancellation after commencing, 5) improved prompts and built-in help 
screen,  6)  group archiving of files, 7) file move, in addition to  copy,  8) 
continuation, on fresh disk, of file copying if destination disk fills, and 9) 
handles "public" directory files.  These added features place utility at head-
of-class.   VFILER takes not a back-seat to other file and  disk  manipulation 
programs,  bar  none.  Online help file has been updated to  reflect  changes.
Built-in help menu, obtained by typing "/" (or "?") once inside program, looks 
like this:

     Those  who read VFILER's HLP file know "next screen" is obtained  by  not 
only  "+",  but also with ">" and ".", as well as "<" and  ","  for  "previous 
screen."   VMENU  and MENU style.  These little touches abound  throughout  Z-
System and its utilities.
     VFILER characteristics make it leader of modern-world file  manipulators.  
Screen-oriented  features make utility fun, easy, and quick to use.  With  its 
CMD  macro command user functions, you gain full control of your computer,  to 
access other menus on your system, and automatically return to VFILER, as each 
task completes.
     At the same time, Joe enhanced MENU as Version 4.0.  Major new feature is 
ability  to  optionally run an initial command line without  overwriting  menu 
display.   Additionally, you can change default drive/user from  MENU  command 
line,  and have DU/DIR correctly be shown from that line.  Both  new  versions 
are on Z-Nodes.  Thanks, Joe!

Z-Node  Activity.   Marvin Eyre, Robards, KY, Z-Node #37 Sysop, tells  us  his 
new  20-megabyte hard disk handles all the Z-System non-proprietary files  for 
his  callers.  His node number, 502/521-7011.  Call, see what gives  in  great 
state of Kentucky.
     Kevin  Dodd,  "The Rogue Node," continues working on his node.   Soon  he 
will have it running.  If you can help, give him a call in Medford, OR,  voice 
503/779-0308.
     Sysop Byron Smith, Z-Node #71, comes online with his Tulare, CA 93274, S-
100,  Z80, 20-megabyte machine.  Has US Robotics Courier 2400 for  fast  modem 
transfers.  Byron's number is 209/685-0306, central California, and he's ready 
for packet radio relay!
     Richard  Jacobson, Z-Node #15 Sysop, 312/649-1730 and  312/664-1730,  two 
numbers,  offers  new  full-screen  Z-System  editor  for  sale.   Uses  ZCPR3 
environmental descriptor, knows DU and DIR drive/user (directory) forms.  LZED 
uses  WordStar command set and sells for only $19.95, with instruction  manual 
supplied  on  disk.  Program was written by Paul Pomerleau, no stranger  to  Z 
community.   Give  it a try...a fast alternative to WordStar  or  Newword  for 
quick  file  editing.   Comes with Sigi  Kluger's  TXTTOWS,  Text-to-WordStar, 
program converting LZED's straight ASCII for WordStar or Newword reformatting, 
i.e.,  hard  carriage returns are converted to soft for  subsequent  paragraph 
wrapping and justification...you can download-purchase directly from Richard's 
boards,  central  point for NAOG (Z-News 408) operations.  Give  him  a  call, 
place an order.

From Our Mail Box.   Many have asked many questions about Release 2 of  Term3.ŠModular  design consisting of over 20 separate programs, Term3 runs only  with 
ZCPR3  and  Z-System.   Versatile T3FILER  handles  file  transfer  protocols, 
MODEM7,  full  KERMIT,  and  XON/XOFF  from  internal  menus,  auto-chains  to 
telephone  dial libraries.  T3HANGUP, T3INIT, T3DIAL do other obvious  chores.
Five  built-in editors to create, modify telephone  libraries,  communications 
sets  (default  conditions), character translation tables, macro  tables,  and 
user  database  entries.   As  many libraries and tables  may  be  created  as 
permitted  by available disk storage capacity, all dynamically  loadable  from 
supplied  menus.   Term3 may be used stand alone for both calling out  and  as 
message  handling system, auto-answering phone calls.  Special  T3KMD  handles 
caller  128- and 1024-byte file transfers.  We supply an example menu  to  run 
complete  system,  easily  modified to your taste  and  requirements.   Unique 
T3MASTER/T3SERVER (with up to 4,096-byte block transfers at serial 38,400 bps, 
and beyond) give Term3 both wide and local area network capabilities.  We have 
used  the  feature since early December and couldn't be without  it.   Z-Nodes 
soon  will have T3SERVER capability as part of Echelon wide area  network.   A 
node becomes an extension of your computer!  Term3 is massive, more total code 
than ZCPR3.  Offered for only $99.00.  But if you have further questions about 
details  of Term3, please purchase 180-page manual for $20.00,  applicable  if 
you  later order the program, which by the way comes on six (6) disks.  As  we 
have  stated twice before: even if you own other modem programs you will  want 
to procure Term3, it's that good!
     "...I like progress, so ZCPR3 is good.  It would be good to realize  that 
the  BIOS  interface as we know it, is based on a floppy disk.  It's  time  to 
change that to a device independent interface like the SCSI bus."  writes H.C. 
Fijnvandraat, Enschede, Holland.  Yes, we agree.  We are moving things in that 
general  direction  with any new BIOS we write.  We try to make  our  software 
less hardware specific, a major shortcoming of CP/M.

Of  Cabbages  and Kings.   Learning is evidence of biological  life,  of  deep 
living.   The  greatest  principle  of learning  is  human  conscious  choice, 
thoughts followed by actions.  Only through change (of being) comes  learning, 
but change is not necessarily progress.
     What with all our speedy machinery, and it seemly gets faster by the day, 
we  sometimes forget about substance.  Writing and cataloging has  never  been 
faster,  but what about content?  Every database is loaded with typing  errors 
of  carelessness, editorial materials of from shallow, surface-only  thoughts.  
Where can depth be found?  New desktop publishing craze leads where we're been 
before.   There  seems to be no end to the blindness  of  short-sighted  self-
interest  and  habit.  Face it.  That we do not do--face the  truth.   Yet  it 
stares  at  us night and day.  We take our pills and use every form  of  other 
crutch  to avoid having to see, having to learn.  We allude to  unwaged  work, 
but  any  type of work done consciously does the job, gets  to  truth,  alters 
habit patterns.
     We  are impatient catering to an ever increasing monolith; it used to  be 
called  laziness,  now  "power-using."  We take off our  shoes,  role  up  our 
sleeves  and trouser bottoms, and enter stream of Life.  Who joins  us?   Come 
and let's rally for change, increased human understanding.  Possibilities  are 
in  our  hands, we control!  Oops!  Knocked over another glass  of  Zinfandel.
See you down the lines...
