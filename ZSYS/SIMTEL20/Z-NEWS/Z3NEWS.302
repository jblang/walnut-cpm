Z TIPS:  An obscure and probably little understood feature of ZCPR3 is that of 
using CMD and SHSET commands.   Any program is converted into a shell by using 
SHSET  on it.   Command (verb) is used to permit application programs to  know 
how  to return to themselves (in addition to being user interfaces,  accepting 
inputs,  and executing commands).   For example,  SHSET WS<cr> makes  WordStar 
into  a shell and there's no way to get out of it,  short of cold booting your 
machine!   Suddenly,  CMD walks on stage, lends a hand, and allows you to have 
your  way with computer.   Use SHSET WS;CMD<cr> as command or alias,  then  on 
existing  WordStar,  CMD runs.   Typing <cr> at this point exits  shell  (with 
ERROR  message set,  permitting directional flow changes to occur if more com-
mands are on line).  Try them, experiment, and see possibilities for improving 
your environment.
     VALIAS is out!  Get it from our nodes...Jay Sage did truly remarkable job 
of  making  aliases  under  Z-System easier to create  and  modify  with  this 
utility.   His TESTERR program, an alternate to FINDERR, is another for us who 
use ZAS and the like. It too presently is on many Z-Nodes.
     Along the way,  Richard Conn has finished (at least for now) our  library 
support tools.   New era begins--they run only on Z80/NSC800/HD64180 computers 
using ZCPR3 or Z-System!   LGET extracts files,  LHELP processes HLP/HQP files 
from within library files;  LLF lists all files, and LX executes specified COM 
files in libraries.   Tools,  on most Z-Nodes,  are in file LUZ3.LBR.  Richard 
and Martin Murray (Dallas, TX) work together to make NULU a full Z3 tool!
     What  makes  a ZCPR3 utility (tool) is described clearly on pages of  229 
and 230 of the ZCPR3 Manual.   Routines in Z3LIB reduce task essentially to  a 
few  subroutine calls!   Let's get Ashton-Tate (dBASE II),  MicroPro (WordStar 
3.0 and 3.3),  Sorcim/IUS (SuperCalc II), T/Maker (T/Maker III), and Microsoft 
(Multiplan) to enhance their 8-bit programs to full ZCPR3 tool status!   Would 
you buy them as upgrades to your presently owned versions?   We would!  Enough 
said?

WOW!  Article describing SB180 and Z-System in September BYTE Magazine hit the 
spot!   Thanks to all who contributed to make commentary possible,  especially 
Mr. Steve Ciarcia of "Circuit Cellar."  (Eight-bit lives--move over 16-bitters 
and make space for us!)  But wait,  there's much more to come; watch remaining 
from-now-to-end-of-year  issues of not only BYTE but many other magazines  and 
newspapers.

We Get Letters:  From William A. Dunn, Springfield, OR, "I am pleased with the 
software but was frustrated with your documentation.   I am looking forward to 
the  manual  which  I ordered last week."  (Manual was  shipped  same  day  we 
received order.)  "Keep up the GREAT work!" commands Alan,  Cathy, and Cynthia 
Foust,  Leonia,  NJ.   And Virgil Cooper, Carpinteria, CA writes, "Gracious Al 
Hawley  responded to my message by phoning this evening...  ."  Larry  Geller, 
Tokyo,  JAPAN,  observes:  "I noticed that each issue of Z-News is costing you 
about  one dollar to mail...enclosed find check for $24.00 to help cover those 
mailings... ."  Thanks, Larry, wish more people understood as you!
     Paul Naitoh,  San Diego,  CA,  asks, "Do I need a hard disk to enjoy Z3?" 
No,  Paul,  as you now know two drives, each with 360k-bytes or more capacity, 
are needed!  Lots of Kaypro 4 folks are enthusiastic users; magazine/newspaper 
columnists/editors Bruce Morgen (Warminster, PA) and Ted Silveira (Santa Cruz, 
CA) are two such!

New  Policy:  You who receive hardcopy version of Z-News and also download  it 
from  a  Z-Node may notice that download version is available only  after  you 
have  received  mailed edition.   Thanks to Rea Williams  (El  Toro,  CA)  for 
instructing  us  about fairness:  those who pay for Z-News should  receive  it 
first!   Those who obtain it only from Z-Nodes,  essentially for cost of phone 
call, get it later.  Phasing set:  Z-News node file is behind mailers by up to 
a fortnight (two weeks)!

Report Card:  All books and copies of Term3 ordered have been shipped.   These 
two items were back-ordered for so long...if you have had an order with us for 
more than three weeks,  and haven't received it,  please drop us a note.   Our 
records are not perfect, neither are we.  Write us if you should have received 
an order and haven't.
     Again we thank you for being patient--the ordeal is over for us,  and for 
you.   Never  again will we get ourselves into such a helpless position of not 
being   able   to   control   what   we   were   responsible   for    creating 
(Frankenstein/monster syndrome).

Amateur Z User's Corner:  We repeat Lewis Carroll
(Rev. Charles Lutwidge Dodgson, 1832-1898) frag-
ment, from his Alice in Wonderland and Through
the Looking Glass series, because it repre-
sents so closely what we do:  many discus-           (Walrus and quote from
sion levels, abruptly shifting from para-            Lewis Carroll's works;
graph to paragraph; but within each, con-          In subcription edition.)
sistency is maintained.   These shifts        
always  produce  movement  leading  to  "The time has come," the Walrus said,
creation   of   mental   spiral--never   "To speak of many things,
linear,  never to be understood as ups    Of shoes and ships and sealing wax,
and  downs,  higher or  lower,  as  if    Of cabbages and kings."
climbing  or descending a ladder,  but 
rather  like soaring over vast  multi-
dimensional  (more than  four)  terri-
tory--observing, feeling, and doing.  You are center of attention and producer 
of motion!   Please don't forget what and who you (and we) could be.  Act (not 
react) while re-acting (feeling)!
     We  wish mad hatter (hacker) would convince his editor to send us samples 
of (subscription to) their slick Canadian magazine (Computek).  We may want to 
                        place an ad,  among other things.  Magazine contains a 
                        wonderful  8-bit  column  written by  one  who  cares, 
                        feels.  Our kind of folk!

                        Z-Node  Activity:   Welcome to mid-state  Z-Node  #34!
                        Sysop Rod Blackman,  Visalia,  CA, needs callers.  You

                             While at it,  we might look into Thomas Hill, 200 
                        Oklahoma  Street,   Anchorage,   AK   99504;   Richard 
                        Driscoll,  400 North 30th Street,  Phoenix,  AZ 85008,

                        nodes may need assistance getting up.
                             Bob Finch, Node #21, our ham radio packet network 
                        expert,   should have a dial-in line soon; until then, 
                        you Los Angeles area hams can contact him by radio for 
                        transfers.   His  call  is N5CXB-1,  on  2-meter  band 
frequency of 146.745 mHz OUT/DOWN 600 kHz;  IN N5CXB, Bob Finch.  Other metro-
politan  area  hams,  who presently operate packet networks,  wanting  to  tie 
landlines to radios using Z-Node concept should contact us,  or Z-Node #2,  Al 
Hawley, voice: 213/649-3575.  One day, when satellite repeaters are available, 
all Earth will be tied together through Z-Nodes!
     Wanting  more  traffic,  Jay  Sage installed a 2400 bps  modem...try  his 
Boston-suburb Z-Node #3 for Z-System information and to get  files:   617/965-
7259.  Remember, Jay's a full downloader of EI proprietary programs.

WOW! again:   Foot put into mouth!   Suggesting (in Z-News 209,  pg  2,  first 
line)  that  everyone read material seven (7)  times,  without  simultaneously 
giving full explanation of why,  has been big stumbling block for many.  So we 
deliver  details  to  remove those (mental)  blocks;  remember,  read  through 
explanation (and everything else) seven times:
     Readings 1 and 2.   Skim material twice,  quite rapidly.  Use your finger 
to  help your eyes play over words,  lines,  and paragraphs.   Key  words  and 
phrases,  ideas,  and concepts begin to take from.   You gain a feeling of the 
thought-flow, a framework making next step more powerful.
     Reading 3.   Read material now from beginning, much more slowly and care-
fully.  Pause to re-read and ponder new ideas and deep thoughts.  Use diction-
ary for unfamiliar words.
     Readings  4  and 5.   Skim over material twice again,  but not  quite  so 
rapidly as first two times.   Let key concepts sink in even deeper.  This is a 
more leisurely skim.   Pause at any word looked up in dictionary and make sure 
you  know  both  basic meaning of word,  and its meaning in  present  context.
Sometimes the thought expressed by a particular word or phrase is so new  that 
it's difficult to grasp at once,  even with dictionary help!   Do not worry at 
this point.  Future readings add clarity.
     Reading  6.   Now,  read material from beginning again with extreme care.
Now is the time to really pause, to ponder, to digest, to impress deeply.  Try 
to obtain essential, inner feeling of messages, even though you may not under-
stand them fully or grasp completely at this stage.  Try at this point to read 
material aloud!
     Reading 7.   It's a slow skim.  Somewhere between your leisurely skim and 
your first careful reading, #3.  It is time to enjoy, to bathe yourself in new 
insights  and viewpoints opening up to you...new understanding comes (in  next 
octave)!
     There you have it--we do our best to explain.   Never think that learning 
something new, really new, comes quickly or easily.  GREAT EFFORT IS INVOLVED!
But  keep  reading even if you think you don't  understand--what  comes  later 
(down  the lines) explains what came before,  following natural  back-and-fill 
(smoothing) concept.

Leadership!  Who leads and who follows?   Bottom of page 5, Newsletter 007, 15 
October 1984,  we addressed clone-magazines, copy-cats, people with less-than-
constructive  ideas.   Our present observation is:   too many editors put  out 
cookie-cutter  editions of their publication.   The mold is supplied by adver-
tisers,  and journal after journal use it!  As we scan 30 to 40 publications a 
month we notice a thread, one of indoctrination rather than education.  So few 
magazines  have  the staff to even edit a news release much  less  investigate 
news  and write their own reports.   If the release wasn't styled by  producer 
for individual magazine format,  it simply isn't run...sad!   Oh!  how sad!  A 
free press?  We wonder what is free in what they generally do...freely leading 
or freely following?
     Clearly our trade journals show little leadership; so many seem detached, 
unemotional,  have little PURPOSE of their own (other than make money as prime 
goal).   They  use  pre-formed mold to produce their offerings.   We  are  the 
losers for it, but it's us who allow situation to exist.
     Most magazines (but not all) follow standard Madison Avenue criterion for 
ad  space cost,  keyed to numbers of  paid  subscribers.   Consequently,  sub-
scription  prices are low--this results in main source of revenues coming from 
advertisers!   Any wonder who controls magazine contents?  Roses don't grow on 
stalks of clover.   When corn seed is planted,  peach trees don't come up!  Is 
this observation faulty?
     Time  to  take a stroll,  feel cool breeze coming in  from  the  Pacific.
Listen  to swaying palms and pines in coast town of Pescadero,  and there  sip 
some  white Zinfandel at Mrs.  Duarte's restaurant and bar.   See you down the 
lines...
