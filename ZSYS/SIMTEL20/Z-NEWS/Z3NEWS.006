                      ZCPR3 NEWSLETTER 006

Source  File  Control:   Echelon controls all releases  to  ZCPR3 
software.   If  you fix a bug please send fix to the single point 
of  distribution correction:  Echelon.   We give full  credit  to 
authors  of  corrections and upgrades.   Please consider us  your 
only point for authorized fixes and changes.   Also, please don't 
put fixes on RCP/M's -- we simply can't keep track of programs we 
don't absolutely control.   We certainly appreciate your  concern 
and consideration for ZCPR3 improvements and problems.

There's  a rumor circulating stating ZCPR3 is only useful on  big 
systems,  those with double-sided 8" or hard disks.  We tabulated 
the file sizes and came up with these approximate figures:

          Programs                      Kilobytes
          Phase 1, 58 COM Files              161
          Beta Test Phase 2 COM Files         48
          Complete online HELP Phase 1       285
          Additional HELP Phase 2            120

     A   small   disk   system  could  not  have   all   programs 
simultaneously  online.   Certainly  all the features of  Z3  are 
available using double-sided 5 1/4" disks with over 350K storage.  
(Our  AMPRO BOOKSHELFtm Model 122 with dsdd drives works  nicely, 
386K storage on each disk.)  A newcomer would have the help files 
available until the system is learned,  then that space would  be 
given up to applications and data.   Not suited to small systems? 
On the contrary,  we cater to Kaypro,  Osborne,  Apple CP/M,  and 
Epson QX-10 users;  Z3 is a major enhancement for these computers 
and their present operating systems.   ZCPR3 puts Unix-like power 
in machines of the 8-bit world.  And so easy to install using Z3-
Dot-Com(tm).

     Speaking  of Z3-Dot-Com,  we are shipping!   The program has 
turned out even better than first hoped.  All the normal features 
of standard ZCPR3 are contained.  Marketing this program conforms 
to  our  company  philosophy:   bringing  useful,  cost-effective 
solutions to the console operator,  matter not what his/her level 
of  expertise  is.   With Z3-Dot-Com,  you need know  nothing  of 
programming  to  get  ZCPR3 up and running on  any  type  CP/M-80 
machine.    It  takes  about  a  dozen  keystrokes,  eact  number 
determined by your terminal being on the first or second install-
menu!   Simple, for example, our mothers could install it, though 
they have never used computers.

Z3  Bug Report:  MCOPY doesn't correctly indicate a  target  disk 
directory-full status during copying.   So be careful at how many 
files are transferred to a disk to avoid crashing the disk.  And, 
MKDIR,  when  writing a new or updated directory to disk,  25% of 
the time erroneously reports a disk write error message.  If this 
happens,  you must manually re-enter the entire SYS.NDR.   Thanks 
to Joe Wright of San Jose, California, for pointing these two out 
to us.   Another,  MENU may crashi if a letter or number command, 
followed by a carriage return,  is entered that is not on current 
menu  screen;   this,   first  from  Chris  Hays  of  La  Canada, 
California.   There's  more.   Lots of minor operational ZEX  and 
Shell problems pointed out by Jay Sage, Lexington, Massachusetts.  
Thanks to all!   These bugs have been verified and presently  are 
being studied.   Finally,  we are planning an on-one-disk release 
of bug-fixed programs,  hopefully before end of the year.  Now to 
paper bugs.

     In   three   places  on  page  91  of   SAMPLER,   the   L80 
$1,Z3LIB/S,... batch statement should read:

          L80 /p:100,$1,Z3LIB/S,...

Without  the  /p:100 declaration,  L80 linker adds an  unrequired 
jump  instruction to the object code.   Special thanks go  to  Al 
Dunsmuir of Scarborough, Ontario, CANADA, for first bringing this 
typo-error to our attention.   Trust our negligence hasn't caused 
too  much  pain  to  those attempting  to  link  utilities  after 
assembly.  (By the way, we recommend using the latest L80 Version 
3.44,  December  1981.   The  earlier versions,  even 3.42  dated 
February  1981,  seem  to  have too many problems  with  our  REL 
files.)

     While installing ZCPR3,  for the first time,  the user can't 
use ZEX batch processing as indicated in SAMPLER, pages 60 to 62.  
Use  EX.COM  (for Executive) instead,  and rename all  the  *.ZEX 
files  to *.SUB.   Replace all ZEX commands with EX <SUBFN>  <FN> 
commands.   After  the system is fully installed,  and  you  have 
assembled ZEX.MAC for your environment, of course it is better to 
use ZEX for all further batch processing.

Z3 TIPS: The MCOPY utility and the RCP-resident CP (for copy, not 
for  command processor) are tailored for different  applications; 
CP  for quick,  short file copying from or to different disk/user 
areas  without concern for copy verification,  but with  optional 
renaming.   On  the  other hand MCOPY is best used  for  lengthy, 
multiple file movements with default automatic verification, file 
existence  testing and inspection,  multiple  disk  copying,  and 
optionally,  no-verification.  With either utility you can copy a 
file from (or to) an area you aren't logged into!  The DIR and DU 
forms  consistently apply.   Remember Z3  "fn.ft,fn2.ft2,fnn.ftn" 
multiple file syntax,  in addition to normal wild card (?  and *) 
naming,  makes  utilities like CP and MCOPY extremely  effective.  
Don't  forget,  this  naming syntax convention is near  universal 
throughout the ZCPR3 Utility System.

     Try  using  ALIAS  to create fast  flow  controlled  command 
files:  an example used for global command with DISCAT.   ZCPR3's 
File and Disk Catalog Subsystem.

          IF NUL $1;CAT:;MENU DISCAT.MNU;ELSE;A8:CATSCAN $*;FI

If parametes (file and disk search specifications) are  specified 
at  the  command  line,  the  CP  (here  CP  stands  for  command 
processor)  runs  CATSCAN in A8:  using the full Alias tail  (the 
parameters).   If only the Alias command is entered, the CP moves 
the machine to directory named CAT:  and runs MENU automatically!  
This  approach can be used in many places to streamline  computer 
operations,  especially  with MENU MNU or from VFILER CMD  files.  
Different   MNU  and  CMD  files  may  be  placed  in   different 
directories for extreme flexibility -- UNIX and PC-DOS, move over 
and breathe our dust.

     Additionally,  comes  a thought from Rick Conn:  to  prevent 
HELP  from  returning  to the system command  line  prompt  if  a 
requested  HLP  file is not found,  consider making HELP a  Shell 
using  the SHSET command of Phase 2.   The way HELP performs  now 
was intentional -- if a file is not found,  take time,  find  the 
file,  and place it in the HELP directory.  Perhaps HELP could be 
managed  by an Alias,  searches made for HLP's not in the current 
HELP directory.  Experiment and announce your findings on AMPRO's 
BBS.

Hacker's Corner:  A few of you notice minor problems with various 
early version of Microsoft L80 -- so do we.  What to do about it?  
Let Microsoft know your feelings;  we have.   They don't seem too 
interested ...  we wonder why!   (By the way, we refuse to accept 
the distortions in the popular press regarding the meaning of the 
word:  hacker.   It  has  meant,  until the ill  or  non-informed 
popular press arrived,  and will continue to mean,  "an intensely 
caring  human  being  who loves  to  design,  write,  and  modify 
computer  programs."   Perhaps this press should learn  a  little 
more  before  it puts pen-to-paper,  especially if they  think  a 
hacker is one who electronically breaks into computers.)  Echelon 
is  considering  negotiating  for  rights  to  sell   inexpensive 
upgrades  to M80 and L80,  and also to sell skeleton packages  of 
MAC.  Certainly present sales of these programs must be near non-
existent  and the two respective companies should welcome someone 
pushing such products, you would think!

As we become accustomed to a particular computer environment,  we 
expect  familiar  tasks to take approximately the  same  time  to 
accomplish.   Such is not the case on a timeshare system.  As the 
system load changes, it takes different amounts of time to do the 
same  task!   With  one user,  if it takes 5 minutes duration  to 
compile and link a program,  then with 2 doing similar  compiles, 
it takes 10 minutes for each.   Or if it took 10 seconds to scan, 
with  your editor from top to bottom of a file,  now the duration 
is  different.   What an unnatural thing to have  to  experience.  
Can  you imagine a four user 80286 or 68000 running under Unix as 
each   user  loads  the  CPU  with  text   scanning,   accounting 
calculations,  or compiles.   Thus we say,  to each his own  CPU, 
connected  through  a local area network (LAN) to other  machines 
and  resources,  eg,  expensive typesetters,  mass  storage,  and 
central mainframe processor.

     Also think of hardware reliability through  redundancy.   If 
the  timeshare goes down,  all users must do something else until 
it's  fixed.   With  a  CPU per user,  many  parallel  units  are 
available  if  one of them fails.   If the  LAN  goes  down,  the 
peripheral units are not available to serve the net.   We believe 
a  machine should have a consistency about it as perceived by the 
operator.   The machine is the tool,  not the operator.  Or do we 
have  something  wrong?   We discuss next  the  techniques'  cost 
differentials, both human and hardware.

We  at  Echelon  feel  blessed  because of  the  quality  of  our 
customers.   You don't seem to have the disease of modern  social 
Western  man:   expectation  of  instant  gratification  for  his 
actions.   For if you did,  you would never have gone through the 
learning  of  ZCPR3  and  what  that learning  can  do  for  your 
computing perspective,  and your understanding of mind and breain 
theory.   You who have studied to appreciate principles of  ZCPR3 
-- studied  long  and hard -- aren't the same as you were  before 
getting involved!   You are now with expanded vision of computing 
and how humans fit into the scheme.  So be it ...

Non-customers  of  Echelon who read the  Newsletter  from  BBS's, 
ARPAnet,  Compuserve,  etc,  are  missing  thrills of seeing  the 
printed letter's fine character formation,  underlining,  bolding 
and  highlighting,  and  superscripting  on  multicolored  paper.  
Moreover,  our  clear  address labels are  something  all  should 
investigate.  Buy from us (ZCPR3: The Manual, perhaps, or DISCAT) 
and  you automatically receive the fortnighter,  delivered first-
class  by the (heaven should forbid) US  Postal  System.   Peace!  
See you down the lines ...
