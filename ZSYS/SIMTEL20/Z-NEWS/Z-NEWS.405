Z  TIPS.   Our description of PUBLIC usage leaves a little confusion in  minds 
of  some of you.  Z-News 303, 304, and 305 went into detail but  disk  (drive) 
versus user area needs more discussion.  Most problems occur because COM  file 
to  be  executed  doesn't  know  of paths and  can't  find  it  trailing  file 
(argument) because it's in other than default directory.  LDR.COM looking  for 
SYS.ENV is good case in point.
     If   disk   A  and  B,  user  area  6,  are   declared   public   (PUBLIC 
/ca,da,db,u6<cr>),  and  SYS.ENV is in B6: with LDR.COM in A15:  (or  anywhere 
along the path), we can issue command LDR SYS.ENV<cr> from, say B0:, and  have 
correct execution.  If LDR understood paths (for its file arguments) we  could 
place SYS.ENV in A6:, without disk B public, and still have the command  work; 
but,  LDR  doesn't, and thus it won't.  Of course most Z-System  utilities  do 
understand  paths  so  PUBLIC works beautiful with them  and  but  one  public 
directory  declared.  To guarantee only one copy of a program is  required  on 
the disk system, a directory for each disk needs to be declared public.
     Directories  are  fully public among areas of the same disk,  and  global 
(from disk to disk) for COM files through path search capability created by Z3 
environment.
     We use area 6 here at Echelon as public (other areas from 1 thru 8  would 
be  just  as  valid) for all disks (drives).  We seem to never  get  into  any 
trouble  with  files not finding each other.  Frankly, our main  computer  (an 
Ampro  Model 1210 Bookshelf) uses only A6: as public.  There we have  V-SPELL, 
WordStar, StarIndex, MailMerge, The Word Plus, along with SYSLIB, Z3LIB, VLIB, 
GRXLIB, GRWLIB, and PDMLIB REL files.  We do wordprocessing in B0:, B1:,  B2:, 
B4:  and  D0:  areas;  computer communications from  B7:;  and,  our  assembly 
language  program development from B10:.  Term3 executable modules,   ZAS  and 
ZLINK,  and  Newword  and  its overlays, are  on  A0:.   A14:  contains  Term3 
overlays,   i.e.,  Comm  Sets,  telephone  libraries,  macro  and   character-
translation tables, etc.  Squeezed HLP files are in A12:.  We use Discat  from 
A8: and not in a public area simply because the modules were written, as  were 
Term3,  to take advantage of Z3 environment.  We use A1: thru A5:  as  scratch 
areas (temporary work space) for formatting (organizing), transferring data to 
and  from  floppies.  By convention, A12: is reserved for HLP  files.   Floppy 
drive C: is for backup.
      Remember, if you declare two drives public, any user area that is public 
for  one  will be public for the other.  However, there is no  reason  we  can 
think  of  for having more than one area public per  drive  (disk  partition).
Also  remember, if files of same name are in both public and non-public  areas 
and  you  erase them in non-public area, they also will be  erased  in  public 
areas.  Watch it!

Of Manuals and Binders.   Our loose-leaf manuals are available for from  $2.00 
to  $20.00,  may  be applied to price of  later  purchased  matching  program.
Manual  for Term3 is example of what's on our mind.  Many good modem  programs 
exist,  some public domain, some commercial.  Buy Term manual to determine  if 
program   is  one  you  want  to  own.   (We  know  Term3  as  most   advanced 
communications  and  modem package ever created.)  Manual describes  its  many 
features in 150 pages, in more detail than an ad or paragraph here.  Comes  in 
standard  8.5 by 11 inch loose-leaf dimensions, and fits into big  plastic  3-
ring binder supplied with ZCPR3: The Libraries, Item 27 on Price List.  Binder 
was made large enough--it's 1.5 inches thick--to hold several Echelon  manuals 
simultaneously, Discat, Zas, ZDM, Libraries, Term3, etc.  Two of these binders 
hold all our manuals and other literature, plus room to expand.  Binders  have 
our  name  and logo (Z-News 303 explains essence of logo) on front  cover  and 
spine, are colored tan with blue lettering.  We offer them for $5.00 each,  if 
ordered  along with software purchase.  Shipping and handling remain at  $4.00 
per  order, continental USA.  Consider buying manual first to study, then  get 
program.  WONDERful idea!  Manual-alone prices:

   Zas - $12.00     ZDM   - $ 4.00     ITOZ  - $ 2.00     Revas3/4 - $20.00
   DSD - $20.00     Term3 - $20.00     Z-Msg - $20.00     Discat   - $ 8.00

Amateur  Z User Corner.   Here's three VFILER CMD lines found  useful  (Z-News 
403  has  more).  CATSCAN is from Discat and permits finding any file  on  any 
disk  in  MASTER.CAT just by entering numeral 5.  All  files  associated  with 
Discat are in, by convention, directory A8:, named CAT:.  T3.MNU is our  Term3 
menu  used to completely control telephone dialing and communications.  And  9 
is  used  to quickly enter pointed-to-library.  Transient  (disk-resident  COM 
file)  IF,  Version 1.2 or later, is used for fcb  conditional  testing;  show 
error  if  not  an LBR file, else run NULU on library.  Notice  we  log-in  to 
particular  directory at beginning and return to current when  through.   From 
home-base directory you access other directories, always returning home  after 
commands are exhausted.  Furthermore, as in command 9 below, current directory 
becomes default automatically, reducing potential confusion, i.e., default  is 
known  and  not mistaken for current once inside, in this case,  NULU  library 
manager program.

Declaring location of IF12.COM avoids time computer takes searching along path 
(especially  if  using 1024 or more directory entries on disk).  It's  a  good 
idea to always indicate in command lines where a file is, if location is known 
and  fixed. By convention, most utilities are placed in ROOT: directory,  most 
applications in BASE:.

Z-Node  Activity.   Five nodes sign-up during fortnight.  First,  Brian  King, 
Castle  AFB, CA 95339, becomes Node #55 sysop.  Will report his RAS  telephone 
number when he is operational.
     Z-Node #56 is online, 817/283-9167, run by Sysop Terry Carroll,  Bedford, 
TX 76021.  Terry covers Dallas and Fort Worth areas which have been unattended 
for so long.  "The system's handle is 'The Poor Man's Z-Node' because I choose 
to  have the best available to everyone, and because I stay broke keeping  the 
system free!"  Thanks, Terry, for seeing our problem and solving it with  your 
online Kaypro 10.
     Steve Kitahata, Gardena, CA 90247, 213/532-3336, becomes sysop for Z-Node 
#57  with CompuPro (Viasyn) 20-megabyte hard-disk 6-mHz Z80 S-100 machine  and 
Prometheus ProModem 1200.  Lots of storage and speed here!
     Kent  Mason,  Oklahoma,  OK 73107, becomes Z-Node  #58  with  a  modified 
Kaypro.   His RAS number is 405/943-8638, but soon changes to  another  number 
when  he  goes to 24-hour per day operation.  Z-Node  #59,  running  Micromint 
TKBBS, is managed by Sysop Michael Hofer in Hicksville, IL 11802.  Stay tuned!
     Ed  Unrein, Orlando, FL, has two telephone numbers for his  two  Z-Nodes:
1) 305/774-2591 for #29, exclusive Z-System software RAS, and 2)  305/295-0844 
for #51, general software.

Menus,  Menus, and More Menus.   A dream come true:  John T.  Brown,  Sterling 
Heights,  MI, produces a definitive set of menus, ready-to-run, for Kaypro  10 
machines using Michael Rubinstein's MMR BIOS.  Based on Echelon DEMO.LBR  file 
material,  but adding significant, first-time-thought-of ideas  and  routines, 
and combining many aliases with MENU and VMENU, he shows what can be done in a 
real-world situation.  Truly impressive!  Even if you don't have a Kaypro  10, 
much comes from studying and applying his techniques. These extended  turn-key 
menus  attain new heights in software/hardware integration.  Bravo!  And  keep 
up  the good work, John.  If interested, download files  MENUS-JB.LBR,  ALIAS-
JB.LBR, HLP-JB.LBR, and ZSYS/MMR.LBR from your local Z-Node.

Potpourri.   Martin Murray, Dallas, TX, author of NULU libraries file manager, 
grants  permission  to bundle his program with our Z-System  software.   Thank 
you,  Martin,  for your generosity and graciousness.  You make  a  significant 
contribution to 8-bit computing community.  Martin officially joins our Z-Team 
of  software developers and tells us that he presently is using The  Libraries 
(SYSLIB36,  Z3LIB13, VLIB11) to convert NULU to a full ZCPR3 utility  (see  Z-
News 009, page 4, for definition of Z3 utility).  As an aside, last known  bug 
in  NULU  has  been fixed.  Get Version 1.51.  Whoopee!   Also,  after  Martin 
finishes  NULU  as a Z3 utility, he may start work  on  long-delayed  Document 
Maintenance Manager (DMM) development, the program that keeps track of changes 
in  a  source listing or in a text file.  (Richard Conn will  probably  add  a 
string-search utility, something like SIFT or GREP, to next release of ZCPR3.)
     Incidentally,  Echelon  actively seeks to market programs  fostering  our 
philosophy, programs that take full advantage of ZCPR3 and ZRDOS  environment, 
that use modern ASCII terminals and business graphics.  Send us your ideas; we 
will let you know if we think your product could be commercially successful.
     Second   issue   of  S-100  Journal  is  on   streets--very   impressive!
Information  about  advances in S-100 technology and new  S-100  International 
Trade  Association  (SITA) lets us know there are alternates to  blue  plague.
"...a  symbol  of  quality, performance, modularity,  wide  support,  infinite 
upgrading possibilities, and non-obsolescence."  That's S-100.  Please, if you 
own  or are planning to buy an S-100 system, subscribe to this magazine.   You 
won't  be  sorry.  Call or write, S-100 Journal, P.O. Box 12881,  Raleigh,  NC

     Fortnight's next-to-best news:  ZCPR3: The Libraries shipped.  All  back-
orders  have  been  mailed, USPS Priority (1st Class).  So if  you  have  been 
waiting  to make sure this book came out when we said it would, wait is  over, 
and  it did--order now!  It's Item 82 on Price List, ended up  containing  310 
pages,  comes  in  plastic  3-ring binder, and sells  for  $29.95  plus  $4.00 
shipping and handling.
     Fortnight's  best news:  David McCord has joined Echelon  as  corporation 
Vice  President.  He adds his significant technical experience and  managerial 
talent  to  our growing staff.  You know Dave as sysop of Z-Node  Central  (in 
Fremont,  CA,  20  miles east of Los Altos) and coordinator  of  other  Z-Node 
Sysops.   These  have been, are labors of love, performed without  pay,  part-
time.   He  continues  with these tasks, but now as  full-time  employee,  his 
efforts  are  expected to enhance other Echelon operations.   Welcome  aboard, 
Dave.   Good  fortune  in  your  new,  exciting,  full-of-potential,  full-of-
challenge position.

Of  Cabbages  and  Kings.   While PC and MS-DOS machines,  along  with  Apple, 
Atari,  and  Commodore  dominate reported microcomputer  news,  we  push  into 
uncharted   and  un-reported  frontiers,  diminish  docility,   and   increase 
understanding.  There can be diversity, you don't have to troop or be a clone.
You  have  access  to data and information; you have a mind to  tell  of  your 
needs.  You can make a difference.  You are the difference!
     We promote something not along main stream, something more rewarding than 
illusion  of  instant gratification, something that thrills, that  comes  from 
reward  of  efforts expended, from learning.  Realize that if you  are  always 
seeking  something  for nothing, you eventually end  up  with  nothing--that's 
ethical state of majority USA presently.  Oh!  We miss the mark!  Filled  with 
material plenty, we are very unhappy with ourselves and our lives,  continuing 
to  expect El Dorado without working for it.  And without knowing work  is  of 
and on ourselves, individually and collectively.
     You  hundreds  of  thousands  of Kaypro,  Ampro,  Morrow,  S-100,  SB180, 
Osborne, Heath-Zenith 89/90 users, don't despair.  We continue to support your 
machines and its software.   See you down the lines...
