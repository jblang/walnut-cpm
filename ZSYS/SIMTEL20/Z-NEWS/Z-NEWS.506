                                  Z-NEWS 506

Z-News  Second  Birthday  Celebrated...with  announcements  of  upcoming   new 
products taking advantage of Hitachi HD64180 8-bit superchip.

    * Micromint develops high-resolution graphics add-on to SB180 single board 
      computer, using existing expansion bus--late October shipping date  set.
      And  Steve Ciarcia writes articles for Nov/Dec BYTE  magazine  detailing 
      new product.  Board includes Hitachi HD63484, graphics chip we have said 
      good things about, to provide 640 x 480 pixel resolution, with 16 colors 
      from  a  palette  of 4096 total (IBM PGA).   Board  comes  with  "Grafix 
      Toolbox"  (GT180 written in Turbo Modula-II) from Borland  International 
      (see  Z-News  306 and 504 for more on Borland and benchmarks  for  their 
      beta-test  Modula).  IBM-style keyboard and RGB monitor  interfaces  are 
      provided.  Sounds good so far...more comes from BYTE and Micromint.

    * Packaged desktop HD64180 microcomputer featuring 256k bytes memory,  one 
      serial port (for modem and printer), 2-96tpi floppies, 640 x 400  pixels 
      using  IBM  standard Motorola/Hitachi 6845 CRT  controller  chip.   Open 
      architecture,  expandable.   Selling complete for  less  than  $1600.00.
      Available in November.  Source of supply will be reported soon.

    * C  Language  Compiler, Database  Manager,  and  Spreadsheet  Program... 
      Compiler  uses HD64180 instruction set to increase compiled  code  speed 
      and  density.  Full Kernighan & Ritchie and Unix v7 functionality,  plus 
      has co-assembler (like Forth, but without Reverse Polish Notation)  that 
      permits  easy  placement  of assembly language  code  within  C  program 
      (available mid August).  Spreadsheet (similar to Lotus 1-2-3) and  Data-
      base  Manager (similar to dBase II) use up to 256k-bytes of main  memory 
      (both  available  late October).  This modern Z-Tools  trio  soon  joins 
      other Lasting-Value Software!

Much to celebrate as these offerings become available.  Programs should flesh-
out skinny frame of 8-bit world.  Stay tuned-in with patience, no scarcity  of 
good things coming.
     --------------------------------------------------------------------
More  on  Searching.   C Language search and extract programs  of  Z-News  505 
produced similar results.  We became curious about where bottle necks were, if 
CPU  (compute)  bound  or  disk I/O bound.   So  we  re-ran  benchmarks  using 
electronic  timer, instead of sweep second-hand of wrist watch;  additionally, 
we  tested from 1) both Ampro's floppy and hard disk (HD), and 2) from a  DT42 
(prototype, see Z-News 502) using big RAMdisk and a floppy.  Both programs and 
text files to be searched were stored on a freshly formatted diskette and used 
alternately  with each computer.  Programs and files were in RAMdisk  for  RAM 
test.  Hard disk had programs in one partition and text files in another.

                             Find 2nd Occurrence of String, seconds
           Program           Ampro-Floppy   -HD   DT42-Floppy  -RAM
           SEARCH v1.25              57.7  38.9          26.7  21.0
           SIFT v2.2b                43.1  38.5          29.3  21.6
           Electa-Find v3.2a         46.8  33.4          23.6  19.3

Search  time  ranged from low of 19.3 seconds to high of 57.7, 3 to  1  ratio, 
controlled by, unsurprisingly, computer chip, memory media, and program.
     Ampro Model 1220 Bookshelftm computer, 4mHz Z80 with 20-megabyte  Seagate 
225N  SCSI hard disk, has 48tpi Cannon floppy with standard 6ms  (millisecond) Šstep  rate.  SemiDisk DT42 was running at 6.144mHz (no wait states) using  big 
RAMdisk and fast 48tpi Fujitsu floppy, 3ms step rate.
     SEARCH and SIFT are essentially of equal speed on Ampro HD and DT42  RAM-
disk;  but,  SEARCH's work buffer is not optimum for Cannon  which  times  out 
almost continually during search.  SIFT appears to have "best" buffer of three 
programs, drives never timing out, making it fastest on relatively slow Cannon 
floppy  drive.  Electra-Find is somewhere in between, with Cannon  timing  out 
about  half as often as with SEARCH.  If design is optimized for  slow  floppy 
you  may  give something up on fast RAMdisk; nonetheless, all  three  programs 
were about equal in RAM tests.
     We  conclude that our benchmark (two-files of combined  32k-bytes  total, 
15-character  search string) is determined by CPU throughput but only if  disk 
I/O  speed  is  sufficient to support CPU  compare-byte  needs.   Study  above 
table...lots of interesting conclusions to be drawn.  Yet mysteries remain.
     DT42  transfers  data from one section of RAM to  another  using  HD64180 
onchip  DMAC/MMU (Direct Memory Access Controller/Memory Management  Unit)  at 
rate  of 800k-bytes per second with 6.144mHz CPU clock frequency (SB180 is  as 
fast, if wait states are removed); 1.6 megabytes per second at 12.288 mHz,  Z-
News  409  and 501 bench testing frequency.  Z80 at 4mHz has  about  half  the 
throughput of HD64180 at 6.144mHz, has no DMAC.  CPU string compare (actually, 
byte compare) capability seems less than 2 to 1 in favor of HD64180;  Electra-
Find's  33.4 and 19.3 second measurements are a tip.   Interesting!   Mystery: 
SEARCH should be faster (we use Version 1.25, the latest, which is faster than 
1.22 used in tests of 505) than other two programs.  It is not; may not be  as 
mature  (old) as the others, less revision has occurred.  Though  written  for 
C/80  compiler, which produced compare-and-loop Bench2 measurements 2.6  times 
faster  than BDS-C used by other two programs (see Z-News 501), SEARCH is  not 
as  fast  as  Electra-Find and no faster overall than  SIFT.   (Speed  mystery 
solved  if  programs  have assembly language subroutines  placed  at  critical 
points in C code, making specific compiler less or not important.)
     After living with these three text search and extraction programs, if  we 
were  to  own only one we would settle for Electra-Find (EF).   More  flexible 
than  other  two, EF is fully menu-driven with  extensive,  clear,  in-context 
online  help along the way.  It is fastest, but not by much.  If needing  only 
simple  searching SIFT is good value.  SEARCH is mid-way between SIFT and  EF.
So  inexpensive,  any  one is considered "a buy" and  candidate  for  WRITER'S 
WORKBENCH  menu  of Z-News 504.  Defaults and menu prompts could  make  search 
set-up  process exactly to your liking.  But let's see how Richard's FINDS  in 
assembler (Syslib) compares...only four little measurements away.

  Flash!   Version  1.6  of  BDS-C is in beta test.   Update  has  lots  of 
   improvements...error detection and diagnosis refined, K&R buffered  I/O, 
   BCD floating point package, standard header file now STDIO.H, and  more.  
   Plus,  RED  editor, written by microcomputer pioneer Ed  Ream,  included 
   with its source code, knows about errors in compilation and goes to line 
   of  first  error--we seek this for assembler.  Still  8080  based...more 
   reported  as  we use v1.6.  Maybe this version is faster than  v1.5a  we 
   have  used for four years.  For immediate additional information,  write 
   or  call Leor Zolman, BD Software, P.O. Box 2368, Cambridge,  MA  02238, 
   617/576-3828.

Another  Announcement.    Massive Index to Z-News, produced by  Z-System  user 
Lorraine  McCord,  now  supplied with $24.00  per  year  newsletter  renewals.
Working with MicroPro's StarIndex, best indexing and table of contents program 
for 8-bit systems we know of, she produced multi-level references to not  only 
Z-News  issue numbers but also to page numbers where material is located.   If 
you haven't renewed your subscription yet, here's sufficient reason to do  so.ŠIndex  is not found on RASs.  Index is not public domain, is copyrighted,  but 
comes bundled in printed-form with subscription renewals to Z-News.  As  added 
bonus,  you who renew subscription to every-two-week  (fortnight)  publication 
are provided latest Z-Node RAS (Remote Access System) listing printed on heavy 
tan parchment.

Z-User's  Corner.    VMENU  and CMD (VFILER)  menus  plus  support  utilities, 
including C source and object for AN, PCC, and WC, described in Z-News 504 and 
505  are all in file called WORK-VMN.LBR (50k-bytes, 400 128-byte records)  on 
Z-Nodes.   From  these files much can be gleaned to assist  in  computer  task 
automation.   Study Z-System User's Guide, pages 5-1 thru 5-6, 6-1 thru  6-18, 
and  ZCPR3:  The Manual, Chapters 5 and 7, as you read a  menu  command  line.
Understand  meaning  of  each  string  between  semicolons,  ";",  Z3  command 
separator.   From  there  you can change, shrink or  stretch,  menus  to  your 
specific needs.  Incidentally, WC, Word Count, counts lines and characters  in 
addition  to words, and handles wild card file name declarations--a  must  for 
writers who measure their writing.
     Need technical help and Echelon phones are busy--try calling one or  more 
of  our thirty or so Good-Neighbor Helpers.  Each volunteered to  help  backup 
Echelon  in any way he can, to promote and increase high-performance,  upward-
compatible  to CP/M, microcomputer use and understanding.  Helpers are  listed 
in  file  ZHELPRnn.RAS found on Z-Nodes.  Quiet and diverse  group,  some  may 
"speak your language" better than we do.  Give GNHs a try!
     Now, let's review a little alias we find useful.  Main purpose is gaining 
flexibility  using  transient  DIR13 (our alias is  called  DIR)  without  re-
assembling its source.  You may gather we prefer horizontal sorts.

              if nul $1;ROOT:dir13 *.* h;else;ROOT:dir13 $* h;fi

Works  like  this:  if no trailing parameter is keyed in  after  command  name 
(verb)  first  command  string of alias is run, showing  all  directory  files 
because of *.* in alias.  Command entered is dir<cr>.  Second string of  alias 
runs  if  file  mask is entered, which selects files to  be  displayed,  e.g., 
*.doc.   Command  entered is dir *.doc<cr>.   In any event, files  show  hori-
zontally sorted because of trailing "h" placed in alias script.
     Recall,  a  reminder of transient-command options  available  is  usually 
obtained by typing transient name followed by a space and two forward slashes: 
command //<cr>.  If you type DIR //<cr> you see:

DIR ver 1.3
 Syntax: DIR dir:afn o
 Options: A=All, S=Sys, H=Horiz, V=Vert, T=File Type/Name Sort

     Alias  (and  menu) script design tip: declaring location  (directory)  of 
command file bypasses path search and speeds command execution.
     Next.   In keeping with our string searching benchmark activities  above, 
we explore an alias useful to those owning The WORD Plus.  TWP's FIND  utility 
determines  spelling  of  words, from any directory if PUBLIC  ZRDOS  Plus  is 
available.  Here's how.  Create alias, we call it Get Spelling, GS, containing 
conditional script (remember "<<" convention, from PAGE and PRINT, means line-
continuation, indicates unbroken line): 

  if nul $1;echo word not specified;echo syntax:gs <word><cr>;else;    <<
  if $1=//;echo syntax: gs <word><cr>;else;a$u:;ROOT:find $*;$d:;fi;fi
 
Using  correct  syntax  and "//" help not requested,  messages  are  bypassed.
Next,  alias  logs into Disk (drive) A but stays in current user  area;  then, Šruns  FIND  (with arguments, if any) on word or words to  locate  (wild  cards 
permitted).  And finally logs back into directory from where we called  alias.
Main dictionary, MAINDICT.CMP, is in public directory declared as  A6:PRIVATE.
FIND.COM  is  in A15:ROOT.  Example command lines (<cr>  means  gently  strike 
RETURN key):

gs ??ing<cr>       display five-letter words in dictionary ending in "ing"  1)
gs cal*<cr>        display dictionary words starting with "cal"             2)
gs cal???<cr>      display all six-letter words starting with "cal"         3)
gs s?t?r<cr>       display five-letter word or words starting with s,       4)
                   having t for middle letter, and ending with r
gs california<cr>  determine if spelling of word is correct                 5)

Words in MAINDICT.CMP are up to 19 characters in length.  Technique of Line 1) 
is  great  for finding word rhymes.  For finding correct spelling of  a  word, 
it's hard to beat line 2).  Simply indicate beginning of word, then a list  of 
words  from main dictionary is displayed to show what might be  desired  word.
Line  4) makes discovering unknown words, e.g., of crossword puzzles, a  snap.
Think  of ways to add as command lines this alias and other word  manipulation 
programs to WRITER'S WORKBENCH menu of Z-News 504.
     Okay!    Here  goes...TWP's  WORDFREQ.COM  easily,   quickly   determines 
vocabulary  of  a document file, how many unique, different words  there  are.
Completing  file profile, WORDFREQ counts total number of words and number  of 
words  used  once.  Additionally, a sorted file of type FRQ  is  automatically 
created  on  default  drive containing all words in document  with  number  of 
times, frequency, each appears.  And finally...
     Our VMENU WRITING.VMN script line, d, using WORDFREQ to create and  VTYPE 
to  scan,  and optionally print selected portions, temporary  word  statistics 
file:

       d $d$u:;ROOT:wordfreq $pf;sak strike any key to continue;  <<
         ROOT:vtype $pn.frq;era $pn.frq

     Many  aliases,  companions to GS and DIR above, can be created  to  speed 
routine  computer operations.  Help us!  Send in ones you find  useful.   Help 
yourself!   Study (read seven times, per Z-News 302, page 3)  Z-System  User's

Lunch  Break.    An  engineering  and  graphics  workstation  (Computer  Aided 
Design/Engineering,  CAD/E) leader, Intergraph, Huntsville, AL, has  committed 
to  Fairchild CLIPPER, 30 nanoseconds instruction cycle time, average 5  mips, 
32-bit microprocessor chip set...certainly a beginning for Fairchild, to  have 
such  a  large OEM sign up for their high-performance  processor  and  number-
cruncher (one mflops, million floating point operations per second).  CLIPPER, 
a  three  or four chip set consisting of main processor with  floating  point, 
memory management and I/O units, seems presently to lead pack in microcomputer 
throughput.   Designed by Howard Sachs, formally of Cray  Research,  CLIPPER's 
basic  lay-out  can  be  carried to 25  mips,  beyond  contemporary  mainframe 
throughput  territory.  Wonder who will be second source for these chips,  and 
who is writing an Ada Language compiler.  Assembler and C, FORTRAN, and Pascal 
compilers are available now!  We understand CLIPPER sells for about  $1,100.00 
each  in  small  quantities, price soon goes down  to  $500.00  as  production 
increases.   National's  32032 6mHz set goes for $84.95.  Oh!   Well...   More

Of  Cabbages  and Kings.   Information gathering and processing  tools:  Term3 
under  Z-System  collect  and  prepare data from A to  Z,  for  subjects  from 
Astrology  to Zoology.  All obtained from places like The Source,  CompuServe, 
and  over  2,000 other remote access systems.  Data about finance,  law,  real 
estate, farming, health, sports, engineering, auto repair, politics--words and 
numbers, facts resolved into information we individually turn into  knowledge, 
and  finally,  with more work, into understanding to improve our  life.   Last 
year, for the first time in history, money spent supporting office workers ex-
ceeded  that  spent for factory workers.  "Information" as an  industry  grows 
faster than any other segment of modern life.  Yet what do we communicate?  Do 
we even know meaning of word communicate?  Lo!  Knowledge never seems to be  a 
match for that called ignorance.
     Laser  printers,  typesetters, are dazzling additions to  desktop  micro-
computers, but a 24-wire-head dot matrix still is cost effective, does a  good 
job,  for  both text and graphics.  We use Epson's new  LQ-800  and  Fujitsu's 
mature DPL24 for most of our work.  You have seen their output; latter is used 
for  Z-News.   A  laser could be added but we spend  our  energy  on  document 
content  instead  of form.  Substance over appearances,  depth  over  surface, 
these are our priorities.  Others join us with quickness of arthritic turtles.
But  we  continue thinking what we do is necessary, more  necessary  now  than 
ever,  at  least  for  us; sheep recognized from goat,  wolf  from  lamb.   An 
individual's attitude is incisive, makes the difference...institutions are not 
as  important as individuals...endless repetition from habit, or move to  next 
plateau, into next octave of consciousness...it's up to you and me.  We affect 
outcomes!  What we each do is infinitesimal, but what we each do is infinitely 
important in determining kind of world we live in.
     Rise up!  Pray, free us from invalid thinking, superstition.  Into  trash 
can  with these.  Permit us to have new thoughts, to break negative ties  that 
bind,  that  inslave.   Our goal is freedom, freedom to  become  what  we  are 
capable of becoming, free to BE.
