Z3  TIPS:   CLEANDIR and UNERASE go together like a hand and  custom  tailored 
glove.   Running CLEANDIR does principally two things:  sorts the directory of 
a  disk,  making for faster other-program usage;  and cleans out  de-allocated 
CP/M file block data from previously valid, but now removed files.  If UNERASE 
finds  blocks with names the same as the file to be unerased,  there is little 
hope of a successful unerase.  CLEANDIR removes all de-allocated names as well 
as  compacts the entire directory area,  leaving only presently  active  data.  
The  problem  with  attempting to recover accidentally deleted files  is  with 
potential  previous disk/edit operations;  many de-allocated disk data  blocks 
with the same name creates the impossible task of reclaiming the desired  ones 
of the present file.  If you have run CLEANDIR and then accidentally erase and 
attempt to recover, odds are near 100% the attempt will be successful.
     Floppy Disk File Access Speed Increase Tip:   Copy to a freshly formatted 
system disk,  one with CP/M on it,  the files you most often use.  The copy to 
be  singularly  performed,  one  file at a time in the exact  order  they  are 
normally used.   A boot disk for ZCPR3 might be ordered:   STARTUP.COM  first, 
then  LDR.COM,   SYS.*,  MYTERM.Z3T,  followed  by  application  MENU.COM  and 
MENU.MNU.   Then your editor/wordprocessor, etc.  Such system-disk preparation 
may  greatly  increase access speed--files are all grouped close  together  on 
disk tracks, eliminating need for lengthy disk-drive read/write head seeks.
     Change  of  pace...we are looking at an excellent example  of  aggressive 
ZCPR3 menus,  from user John Gliedman,  New York City, containing long command 
lines.   They appear especially useful in automating magazine-article and book 
writing.   The  concepts  are applied to a dual-drive Osborne with  RAM  disk, 
using two versions of WordStar,  MENU,  IF,  ELSE, GOTO, FI, REG, ECHO, ALIAS, 
SAK,  ZEX,  etc.   We  plan to devote an entire newsletter to describing  such 
techniques,  but  for  now just a little tickle showing the ramdisk  load  and 
status commands, L and R, entered from the main menu.

        Lif ex a:-diskname.001;b:user b:ws.com 1;b1:ramdisk c,y,df00;
        b:mcopy b:ws*.* q;b:user b1:ws.com 0;else;a:user a:ws.com 1;
        a1:ramdisk c,y,df00;mcopy a:ws*.* q;a:user a1:ws.com 0;fi

        Rif 9 9;if 8 8;echo ramdisk active and wordstar loaded;sak /p1;
        else;echo ramdisk active but wordstar not loaded;sak /p1;fi;fi;
        if ~9 9;echo ram disk inactive;sak /p1;else;fi

USER  is a set-to-user-area program written by  Michael  Rubenstein.   Ramdisk 
activates  ram  storage,  starting  from DF00 and names it  C:.  MCOPY  copies 
quietly with trailing q.   Registers are set using REG in several  conditional 
STARTUP files, for example:

        STARTUP:  ldr sys.env,sys.fcp,sys.ndr,myterm.z3t;reg s7 1;
                  if ex a:-diskname.001;reg s7;else;fi;fi;start2

        START2:   if 8 8;mcopy menu.mnu;c:;else;fi;fi;menu

Drive C0: is defined as BACKUP so MCOPY default directory search works.
     Almost any computer task you think of is automatable using menu and alias 
generation,  and  multiple commands per line capability of ZCPR3,  and such is 
accomplishable  so swiftly.   The tools are there--a little thought puts  them 
into action and to work.

A Note from Richard Conn -- "The BOOK:   ZCPR3:  The Manual is almost done, at 
long  last.   To brief you on what has been going on,  three editors have been 
working on the book.   Two are literary editors,  and their job was  completed 
some time ago.   The third editor is a technical editor, Chris Terry, formerly 
of  Microsystems  magazine,  has agreed to act as a technical editor  for  the 
book,  and I think he has done a marvelous job.  He is currently reviewing Z3-
Dot-Com  and  is  placing a section into the book on it.   He  has  helped  to 
clarify  several  of the points stressed in the book and has really devoted  a 
lot of time and attention to it.   I really appreciate what Chris has done and 
feel that the book will be much better for it.
     "Chris should complete his final review very soon.  At this time, he will 
send  the book back to me on floppies,  and I will run Star Index over it  one 
last  time and perform a last-minute review.   I will then send the Star Index 
output  back to Chris,  who will print it out for the publisher [Zoetrope]  to 
typeset.   We  are running approximately one week later than the  last  posted 
schedule,  so the book is still set to go out around the end of October, first 
of November."
     Be assured, Echelon ships as soon as books come from printing presses!

DISCAT  Reminders:   Things  DISCAT users may find useful:   1)  Put  all  CAT 
programs in A8: and using MKDIR name that directory CAT.  2) Again using MKDIR 
create a directory called BACKUP for auto Master Catalog copying (para.  3.1.3 
of  DISCAT manual),  as a second file,  to another disk--good protection  from 
Master  Catalog  lose.  Command  #3 from the DISCAT menu erases  the  temorary 
backup created on A8:CAT>.  CATUPD also defaults to updating disks to selected 
catalog from directory BACKUP (para. 4.2.8).  So please make a named directory 
with  that  name.  If you don't,  the default drive is B:  as it is  for  disk 
copying.   3)  If  you  wish  to change the directroy  (disk/user  area)  that 
receives  disk names,  change "catname" menu command line to  that  directory. 
The  DISCAT  menu  command line ncatname C31:"Name of Disk -- "  (page  60  of 
manual)  controls these things.   You may want to change the C31:  to BACKUP:. 
     Notice  that MCOPY has a default search for directory BACKUP,  convenient 
to use as backup copying for any file.   That's why command lines like "bmcopy 
master.cat m" work.   By using MKDIR to establish a directory named BACKUP,  a 
disk/user area is defined for all your backup files.
     If you have a hard disk occuping A:  and B:, then you may find it cleaner 
to keep all catalogs on B8:  and the DISCAT utilities on A8:.   Then B8: would 
be named CAT, as in the DISCAT manual.

Good News:  Phase 2 is shipping.   Programs contained in this release catapult 
the  ZCPR3  System into new domains of  elegance.  Screen-oriented  utilities, 
easy-to-live-with computer resource control,  each makes life pleasant for the 
console operator.  The release is in two groups and purchased from Echelon for 
$8.00 per disk plus $3.00 shipping and handling.  (California customers please 
add 6.5% sales tax.)
     The first_group, and probably more popular, is a two-disk set for $19.00, 
complete, contains:

	  VFILER -- a screen-oriented file and disk housekeeping
                    manager, with marco-command menu (CMD files)
                    ability; a major tool to create streamlined,
                    menu-controlled turn-key systems
           VMENU -- enhanced MENU with cursor addressing and partial
	            DIR display capability (VMENUCK locates menu
		    command lines containing syntax errors)
 	     DU3 -- video version of famous DU, Disk Utility; full
                    disk editor with built-in help system
	     MU3 -- Memory Utility allowing RAM changes on-the-fly,
	            using screen cursor pointing to addresses be
		    changed, in either ASCII or HEX; has built-
                    in HEX calculator, a menu of commands, etc.
	     CMD -- places a multiple command line into the command
		    line buffer and executes
	   SHSET -- makes a Shell of any application program, even 
		    WordStar or dBASE II
        CLEANDIR -- clears out de-allocated disk data from directory
                    area, like public domain SAP but much faster; used
		    often, permits UNERASE to work nearly every time
       DPROG.ASM -- device programmer, a tool file to initialize and setup 
                    CRT terminal, printer, or other device parameters;
                    several may be used, each for different desired
		    environments (for each DIRectory, using CD and ST)
    DEBUGRCP.ASM -- Resident Command Package (RCP) addition, useful during
                    program development sessions; a cut-down version of
                    MU3 but memory resident

     Screen-oriented  features of above commands should impress.   Each  comes 
with  an online help file consistent with ZCPR3 HELP System.   These nine  (9) 
utility programs round out ZCPR3's capability to create the computing environ-
ment we dream about.
     The  second_group  of Phase 2 consists of the above two disks  plus  four 
more  for $51.00,  including S&H.   If ordering from California,  don't forget 
6.5% state tax.  The additional disks contain:

          Source Code -- for all object files on disks #1 & 2
                         of group one, on two disks
                VLIB  -- library subroutine support for modern
                         CRT screen manipulation, cursor motion,
                         erase to end of line, clear screen, half-
                         intensity, etc., occupies 1/2 disk
                Z3LIB -- subroutine library provides access to
                         ZCPR3-specific features, environment
                         descriptors, flow control, messages, and
                         utilities, on 1 1/2 disks

     For those who ordered only the first group and now want the  second,  the 
price is $35.00, S&H included.
     These programs are of extreme value considering their usefulness, person-
hours  required to write and debug,  and ease of extension using SYSLIB,  VLIB 
and  Z3LIB--that's  quality,  another example of Lasting-Value  Software  from 
Echelon.   They,  separately  a  series  of small  gains,  combined  create  a 
revolutionary environment permitting modular application program development.
     Stay tuned for description of upcoming TERM3 communications program.   If 
you  like  DISCAT and its blending with the ZCPR3 environment,  you will  love 
TERM3.   (We start shipping TERM3 soon, hopefully within a month or so.)  This 
application program,  plus DISCAT,  signals menu-driven, completely harmonious 
systems  are now within your grasp,  if ZCPR3 is used.   And you  control  the 
menus, aliases, and macro command CMD files: you are free!

Very  Bad News:  IBM pulls an Osborne-style blunder in announcing and  pricing 
their new PC-AT (Advanced Technology) computer.  In effort to cut AT&T off-at-
the-pass  and  dominate the PC market,  as it has so competently done  in  the 
mainframe  business,  the  AT has been priced so low that sales  of  both  the 
standard  PC  and the PC-XT are being dramatically  curtained.   Additionally, 
manufacturers of PC clones,  super clones and supermicros just don't have  the 
volume  production  or buying power to price down in the AT range--hard  times 
ahead  for them.   But unplanned side effect is IBM being greatly impacted  in 
short term because they can't meet demand caused by shortages (that will  last 
for  9  months)  of Intel 80286 chip used in the machine.   Slow  delivery  of 
product  has caused a wait-and-see attitude in perspective buyers  of  full-up 
PC's,  IBM brand or otherwise.  Potential customers presently inert waiting to 
see what happens with IBM-Xenix, Unix System III and System V, and wonder if a 
PC-DOS 4.0 with windows is soon coming to obsolete popular Xenix.
     IBM  can  weather a storm they (in error?) created,  but  many  small- to 
medium-size  companies are going to go under because of it.   Unix  future  is 
still quite unclear,  especially System V.   If AT&T starts losing money,  and 
there  is chance it will,  IBM big-victory is near.   Next from IBM-ROLM  come 
power  moves  in  integrated telephone data/voice switch (PBX)  market  toward 
dominance.   Can AT&T effectively, efficiently counter and be competitive?  In 
straight voice switches they aren't well, 8% of market versus ROLM's 35%.
     In  this pending calamity,  an 8-bit Z800/ZRDOS/ZCPR3  combination  could 
gain a small minority foothold in personal LAN computing.   Zilog could take a 
path  away from its present position of being fourth in a field of four in the 
16/32  bit  marketplace  and make a real mark with a  super  performing  8-bit 
machine.   The Z800 has the architecture to be that machine.   OEM's,  are you 
listening?
     The difference between predicting (foretelling) versus dictating  (deter-
mining)  the  future is interesting to ponder.   The present is determined  by 
history (the past):   the future is determined by what is past and what we  do 
now, the present.  To dictate the future requires changing the past (present)!
Very interesting considerings.   Can IBM change history,  the past or present?
The thought chills.

New-Users-of-CP/M_Corner:   Lots  of  first-time computer  users  are  getting 
acquainted  with both CP/M and ZCPR3.   The understanding to fully  appreciate 
how computers work takes time to acquire.   And study and work and study.  But 
nothing of value is obtained unless we have been changed by the experience and 
work changes us.   Learning to use computers and their software is a life-time 
adventure--one full of thrills and heart aches.  But consider that solution to 
any  problem  we  face  is simply to relax,  observe  characteristics  of  the 
problem, think about it lightly, study more; the solution comes when we aren't 
thinking about it!  Relax, and  learn what learning is all about.  Getting up-
tight  doesn't help--just wastes precious energy,  energy to which  access  is 
limited.  Relaxation opens channels to more energy, knowing, understanding.

                     A human has untapped, strange powers
                never used in normal circumstances.  Glimpses
                        are recognizable during times
               of eminent adversity, tragedy or extreme danger.
    Necessity of survival drives forth to our consciousnesses the marvels
              lingering beneath the surface.  Break the covering
                 (through relaxation) and be surprised at the
   wonderments contained inside us.  Truly the Infinite is already locked,
           vested profoundly internal and most of us sense it not.

The  next  paragraph was prompted by many new users of CP/M,  and  potentially 
ZCPR.  (Who said CP/M is dead!)

What  it  takes to handle installation of ZCPR3:  Command files  required  are 
MOVECPM,  SYSGEN,  DDT,  MAC,  ED,  SID/ZSID,  MLOAD,  RELS.UTL,  and EX.   In 
addition,  if  alteration of utilities is desired,  M80 and L80 are necessary.
The  public  domain  programs of the group (the last three in  the  list)  are 
supplied,  courtesy, their authors and Echelon.  As reported previously, we're 
trying to negotiate a bargain deal to supply,  with our documentation, MAC and 
SID/ZSID, and M80/L80, from Digital Research and Microsoft, respectively.
     Manual  ZCPR3  installation (using DDT and MOVCPM) is easily  handled  by 
programmers  with  two  years  experience with  Assembly  Language  and  CP/M; 
the task is usually completed in four (4) hours.   New computer users find the 
chore  difficult,  but  possible if time is taken to learn what's  not  known.
Echelon helps in this process whenever possible.  Remember we are dealing with 
an epic,  a package of software that is equivalent to Unix.   You can't expect 
to understand it instantly (though Z3-Dot-Com installs almost instantly)!   At 
any point in time,  we doubt if anyone fully understands the complete system--
it's  simply too massive for a human to remember.   The ZCPR3 online  HELP  is 
competent  aid to fallible organic memory.   We are developing further aids to 
assist the console operator;  the GLOSSARY and ZCPR3 COMMANDS cards are  early 
products, already supplied to all our customers...it's a beginning.

Shipping  and  Handling  (S&H) Explained:  We control overhead  in  every  way 
possible.   Minimizing paper work is one.  We charge a nominal average for our 
shipping and handling.   Thus a customer who orders a single disk is partially 
paying  for the one who orders a large amount of documentation and  multi-disk 
software.   The  large package is charged the same as the small.   We feel the 
average  is treated fairly with the extremes getting a better or  worse  deal. 
But our overall costs are lower with the reduced clerical and paper work.  Our 
software,  we surely suspect, is already a bargain so we hope few get upset at 
the  sometimes  high  postage charged for a one-disk  shipment.   It's  not  a 
perfect world; many stumble along the path thinking it is!

FLASH:  New BBS and RCP/M now operates.   This station is central, prime board 
for ZCPR3 news.   David McCord,  Fremont,  California, is SYSOP.  Computer was 
thoughtfully  donated by Ampro Computers of Mountain  View,  California.   The 
METAL message system used (the best in the business, we think) was provided by 
Tim  Gary  and  Byron McKay of Delphi Data Systems,  also  of  Mountain  View. 
Dave's  joining the ZCPR3 team speeds both reaction to customer questions  and 
interchange of data and information, quickening knowledge and understanding of 
ZCPR3  and the ZCPR3 System.   We welcome his vital assistance!   Please  make
