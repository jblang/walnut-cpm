Z  TIPS:  The making and using of aliases is so easy,  now that Jay Sage's two 
tools are available:   VALIAS and ARUNZ.  We can have our cake and eat it too, 
have our way with computing machine we're learning to use!
     Our four new library tools (in LUZ3.LBR,  see Z-News 302),  LGET,  LHELP, 
LLF,  and LX, are meant to complement NULU, flexible library manager.  Used in 
alias script files, extended features--to automate library operations--are now 
available.   LUZ3.HQP tells all, but use HELP, Version 5.3, to read it.  Don't 
forget:   all Z-System HLP files can be file-typed as HQP (squeezed), but only 
if using 5.3, saving about 30% disk space from that required earlier.
     LX (Library eXecute) is particularly useful running COM files from libra-
ries  other  than COMMAND.LBR.   Here,  IF12.COM upgrade  of  Charles  McManis 
(Sunnyvale, CA) really shines in aliases requiring wildcard file name testing! 
Use  VALIAS to create and modify scripts,  or your editor to add to  prototype 
text file ALIAS.CMD, and then execute with command:  ARUNZ <alias name> [para-
meters]<cr>.  Individual ALIAS.CMD files may be placed in various directories, 
like  VFILER.CMDs,  along  search  path  for  security  control  and  enhanced 
versatility.
     In  case your implementation of ZCPR3 doesn't include the GO command  but 
does have GET and JUMP,  don't fret!   JUMP 100 is similar to GO.   Using JUMP 
100  is  like calling location 100 hex;  computer's program  counter  (PC)  is 
indexed  to location 100 and op(eration) codes there are executed.   So if you 
load  (GET 100 fn.ft) a program,  you can run it by issuing command JUMP  100. 
(GET  uses  absolute addresses,  not pages as indicated in  the  MANUAL;  also 
there's no CP-resident ECHO.)

New ZRDOS Plus:  Dennis Wright's stroke of brilliance makes programs  WSPATCH, 
MAKE,  SETDRU, and PUBlictm Patch no longer necessary.  ZRDOS with public DIRs 
and  DUs  open new possibilities for Z-System users.   With utility  supplied, 
disks and user areas are declared global,  PUBLIC.   There,  place overlays of 
special programs like WordStar, T/Maker, dBASE, The WORD Plus, Multiplan, even 
MBasic  (BAS and ASC) files!   Then use these programs from any drive or  user 
area,  with but one copy of each on your system!   So quick and easy:   PUBLIC 
can be handled automatically with your STARTUP alias!
     For  $20.00  you can go from original ZRDOSs to ZRDOS  Plus  with  public 
directories.   Send in your original ZRDOS or Z-COM disk.   New Plus sells for 
what old did, $59.50 plus shipping and handling. 

We_Get_Letters:  "Thanks for sending my copy of ZCPR3: The Manual so quickly!" 
writes R. Glenn Brooke,  Evanston,  IL.   Glenn,  our shipments haven't always 
been prompt!   Ask thousands who waited long for book you received so quickly, 
but  that's  another  story,   one  about  evolving  towards  concordancy...we 
presently bask in radiant abundance.
     From Jerry Nelson, Marburg, GERMANY, "Teach us about obtaining libraries, 
using  linkers,  and  advanced  library  management  techniques.   (Where  are 
potentially useful modules?  Which revision is current?  How do we standardize 
the  environment  for system calls,  terminal configuration disks,  amount  of 
RAM... .)"  In his three-page letter lots of probing questions are asked about 
real-time,  multi-tasking,  and  support for high level  languages.   Briefly, 
Jerry, our presently available SYSLIB3, Z3LIB, and VLIB--all in Assembler--are 
main source for over 400 tested and often-needed routines.
     A thick document (over 400 pages,  written by Richard Conn),  soon to  be 
published,  tells how to design and code using REL libraries.  Manual contains 
sufficient  information making other than Assembler for Z80/NSC800/HD64180  8-
bit  systems  un-necessary,  and undesirable,  considering  computer  run-time 
resources usually available.  High level languages may be okay for some 32/64-
bit machines,  but generally not for 8-bit.  Program design and coding must be 
fitting for end-user,  programmer's conveniences secondary--to be Master,  one 
must  be Servant to All!   Dreams can become reality...our  real-time,  multi-
tasking OS is in the works!

PropStar Program Review:  We've been using,  off-and-on for about nine months, 
a  print  utility  that works with WordStar files.   Utility's  major  feature 
provides  true proportional character spacing on daisy  wheel  printers,  with 
right-margin  justification that follows typesetting rules.   Other  features: 
continuous  underlining  with  new .cu dot command  and  extra  intercharacter 
spacing when boldface (shadow) is activated.
     We  don't use daisy wheels,  but a 24-wire dot matrix software compatible 
with Diablo 630.   Civil Computing Corporation (2111 Research Drive, Suite #1, 
Livermore,  CA 94550,  415/455-8086) wrote program to take advantage of market 
represented  by millions of WordStar users,  which includes most of  Echelon's 
staff.   Program,  though  written in Fortran and Assembler  (26k-byte  length 
takes  a  few  seconds to load,  but program keeps up with  our  fast  printer 
needs), is great for post-processing WordStar text into proportionally-spaced, 
right-justified  output to printers.   PropStar,  Version 2.0,  Release D,  is 
priced $79.95--worth more!
     Other  so-called  proportional printing programs for WordStar  have  been 
used here at EI--none tried is as valuable as PropStar.   They, the rest, fake 
the process by using internal table and algorithm of WordStar that don't work; 
that's why MicroPro wouldn't support proportional printing.   They knew  their 
program  wasn't  right and talent that could make it right were no  longer  in 
their employ.   MicroPro hasn't been motivated to make it right,  at least not 
for 8-bit versions 2.5, 3.0 or 3.3.
     CCC is thinking of offering a generic laser printer (Cannon) with special 
PropStar.   It'll sell at low price--compared to Hewlett-Packard,  Apple, QMS, 
Imagen,  and CTI laser marking machines--such combination we are interested in 
testing (and buying if it suits our high-performance needs)!

Amateur Z User's Corner:  When studying ZCPR3:  The MANUAL, or reading Z-News, 
do  not  allow doubt as to meanings of words muffle,  muzzle,  or muddle  your 
                        thought.   Use  your regular and technical  dictionary 
                        often.   It  is  amazing how definitions  can  clarify 
                        thought.   Dictionaries are like arms of our mind,  so 
                        important is lexicology to our mental body.
                             You  know  time and effort is required  to  learn 
                        ins-and-outs   of  ZCPR3  and  Z-System--learning   in 
                        proportion to giving (your energy).  For us who have a 
                        lazy  streak  we  wrote in  Z-News  106,  "Appreciate, 
                        accept,  our  Universe is about releasing energy  from 
                        matter--you are its center (did you think it was about 
                        matter being created from energy,  you silly savage)." 
                        Enough said?   How's your progress learning  DU3,  the 
                        far- ranging disk editing utility?
sketch of a member           The  MANUAL  isn't completely clear  about  tools 
  of royality           responding  to  WHEEL and QUIET  commands.   Utilities 
     with               presently wheel-byte protectable:  ALIAS, MKDIR, PATH, 
  below quote:          PUBLIC,  VALIAS,  VFILER's copy,  rename,  and  delete 
                        functions,  PWD's  table of passwords associated  with 
 "If they find Unix     name  directories,  and WHEEL itself cannot be set  or 
 harsh, inefficient,    reset without operator knowing correct password.
      and slow,              Certain  crucial  programs respond to  the  QUIET 
 let them use Z... "    flag,  cancelling  most messages to console  operator: 
                        CD,  LDR,  MCOPY,  PATH,  and  REG  (plus LUZ3 and  25 
                        command modules of Term3).
     Such  tool  flexibility  is  ideal for  setting  up  turn-key     systems 
tailored exactly to your requirements.   Their use with remote access  systems 
(RAS)--like  electronic  bulletin boards and local area mail networks--adds  a 
touch of class, compared to what is possible with Unix and PC-DOS.  But first, 
MENU,  VMENU,  and VFILER usage must be mastered.  Re-read 101, 104, 106, 202, 
and  203 and Chapters 5 and 7 of the MANUAL.   Sample menus contained in  file 
DEMO.LBR are good place to see many working examples.   Menus cover  automated 
tasks  for  word processing,  database and  spreadsheet  management,  communi-
cations, assembly language program development and modification, disk and file 
housekeeping, and system maintenance.

                  BEAUTY  IS  JUST  THE  FRAME

All beauty inspires most.   I am a country boy,  born and brought 
up in the town of Vinci,  in Tuscany [Italy].   I love nature and 
have  a constant dialogue with it.   Not exactly like those sweet 
old ladies who talk to cactus flowers, but in the sense of loving 
it and letting it help me.  I have never had such an exhilarating 
experience  as  with the  nature  scenes,  the  backgrounds,  for 
BROTHER   SUN,   SISTER   MOON.    I understood Saint Francis  of 
Assisi through those scenes.   He was  stunned,  bewildered,  and 
driven  almost  berserk  by the beauty that  surrounded  him.   I 
believe,  as he must have,  that God expresses Himself most  elo-
quently through the beauty of His creation.
     Nature  is  very generous.   Man-made material is  not.   It 
resists you.   You must think about it,  plan for it, by it.  You 
buy  acrylic or whatever you need for a scene or a set,  and  you 
have it made.   You paint it.  You move it around.  You work with 
it,  and still it resists you.   It is hard to conquer;  hard  to 
bend  to  your  will and to your  experience.   But  nature  just 
happens.    And  unlike  the rest of our world,  it is  not  con-
formist.   Nowadays the whole world is plagued by conformity, and 
I hate it.   What has happened to the freedom that was so evident 
in classical times and in early America?
     Today,  free spirits are becoming pathetic relics.  And I am 
one of them.   I simply cannot conform,  or line up with a multi-
tude  of people who profess the same ideas.   Every man,  however 
many  billions of us there are now,  is a planet [sphere] of  his 
own.   If there is a harmony in the universe, then each one of us 
is somebody;  that's the dignity of life.   Instead,  we throw it 
away by trooping.  Even by trooping in good causes.
     Many  people seem surprised that I can continue to have  two 
or three careers at the same time.   That is because  conformists 
tend to assign themselves,  and others, a specific role:  you are 
a writer,  I am a director,  that dog is a dog.   Period.  People 
with more that one career confuse them.   It is, I admit, perhaps 
a  bit like having three lovers.    And that is not very ethical.  
One is supposed to say,  "This is it," but often it isn't.   With 
one lover,  for example,  you go to the theater and opera.   With 
another you discuss books.  With a third you don't talk, you make 
love.
     The  aim  in my profession is to create beauty and  to  make 
dreams come true.   I am fed up, however, with the label "creator 
of beauty."  Beauty is just the frame.   Inside the frame must be 
the  picture.   I don't think people cried and suffered  with  my 
ROMEO  AND  JULIET  just  because  the  costumes  and  sets  were 
beautiful.   They  cried because I really grasped the essence  of 
this love story, the reality and the vitality of the characters.

Z-Node Activity:  Welcome to northern neighbor Sysop Terry Smythe, Z-Node #40, 
204/452-5529.   Terry runs a club node for iBEX and Osborne computer users  in 
Winnipeg,  Manitoba,  CANADA.   Locals are having one-good-time downloading Z-
stuff.   If you have a few extra coins this month,  give his out-of-the-States 
node a call for one of those changes of pace we all need now and then.
     To  get  really out-of-sight,  contact our European  distributor,  Robert 
Kuhmann,  in  FRANCE.   Bob is Z-Node #26 Sysop.   He carries full-load of  Z-
System  software and is in regular contact with Philippe  Billotte,  Northstar 
ZCPR3  expert (see Z-News 303).   Call Bob at 011-33-90-77-61-36  (from  USA); 
write Philippe at 47 Rue Abou Dabi,  Quartier Oasis, Casablanca, MOROCCO.  Let 
them know how small this planet is!
     Digitec  Z-Node  #5  (Lisle,  IL) on a roll...Sysop Ron  Stone  tells  of 
activity on his node.  Much comes from pioneers of microcomputer world:  CACHE 
(Chicago  Area  Computer Hobbyist Exchange) founders and members,  Jim  Mills, 
Ward Christenson, etc.  Need we say more!  Ron's number is 312/420-1722.
     Sysop Mike Ward,  Z-Node #11,  Voorhees,  NJ, 609/428-8864 found a go-for 
that  keeps his RAS current with Dave McCord,  Z-Node  Central--hurray!   Many 
callers  have found Mike's system just what they've been looking for in  south 
New Jersey,  Pennsylvania, and Delaware areas...Z-System activity continues to 
grow  as  more  people  understand the power of  ZCPR3  combined  with  ZRDOS. 
Assistance  for continued learning comes from Z-Nodes and their  Sysops.   All 
RAS  operators share a deep emotional interest in assisting those who ask  for 
help.

October  issue  of BYTE magazine clearly describes many,  but  far  from  all, 
features of Z-System.   Those not familiar with Z have much to compare:  8-bit 
with 16/32-bit;  Z with CP/M and PC-DOS,  and appropriately with Unix.  Z sets 
the pace...combined with Term3, there is none that matches flexibility, grace, 
and efficiency.  Order Term3 now and get in on free future upgrade.

                        RELAX!   The  race  is neither to the  swift  nor  the 
                        cunning,  but  to  those who use work as  a  conscious 
                        means to learn,  become,  and realize.  The RACE is to 
     racing             those learning!
  motorcyclist               Musings  from  keyboard  about  Cosmic  geometry: 
      here              first  infinity  (zero) is of position  only,  without 
                        dimension  or  form;   next,  is  linear  displacement 
                        followed by planes (2-D);  then substance,  full  3-D, 
                        followed   by  substance  displaced  in  time   (4-D). 
                        Entering  extremely oneiric domains,  we add  all-time 
                        (past,  present,  and future),  the fifth-dimension or 
sixth-level!   Last,  we displace all-time to receive the unknowable  (Western 
concept of GOD), the seventh-level (heaven).  (Notice how we went from zero to 
six  dimensions,  the  way Assembler level programmers normally  count.)   The 
remaining  eighth  (?) level is "nothing-going-nowhere," Eastern idea of  VOID 
(zero, no-thing).
     You  cross  a  psychological  INFINITY as you  add  a  dimension  (either 
horizontal or vertical,  really orthogonal and beyond) to your  understanding, 
to your being.   Eight is more (?) than there is,  having moved back (forward) 
into  the previous (next) octave,  appearances notwithstanding!   Words Gnosis 
(Greek) and Veda (Sanskrit) both mean "The Knowing."
     Now  we ponder zero,  infinity (two zeros  side-by-side,  touching),  and 
eight (two zeros,  one on top the other).   Seems East and West meet...soon to 
follow, North and South!  You think we drink too much Zinfandel?  See you down 
the lines...
