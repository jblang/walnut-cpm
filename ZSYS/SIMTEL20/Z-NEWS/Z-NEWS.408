Milestone!   You are great, why procrastinate?  Learn Z!  Richard Jacobson and 
Bruce  Morgen  edited  Kaypro  Z-System Manual (Z-News  407)  into  a  generic 
tutorial,  one  applicable to any computer running ZCPR3 and ZRDOS.   You  who 
have found our reading material difficult, this is your book.  It is a fitting 
addition  to  lonely  ZCPR3:  The Manual by  Richard  Conn  and  adds  another 
dimension (level) to Echelon documentation.  Titled Z-System User's Guide,  we 
offer  it for $14.95, plus $4.00 shipping and handling, continental  USA--Item 
88  on Price List.   Additionally, Californians must include 7.0% state  sales 
tax.
     Though  an  efficient  learning tool  for  beginners  and  intermediates, 
advanced  users  also  are expected to learn much from  the  Guide.   Creating 
aliases  and  menus, producing ZEX batch files, making VFILER  CMD  files--all 
explained   using  tutorial  style.   Many,  many  how-to-create,   how-to-use 
examples: just what we have needed for so long.

Unique New Computer.   Always ready, no loss of data--ever!  Office automation 
and   development  system  computer  ready.   Oneac  Corporation  of   Chicago 
(Libertyville)  shipping  Z80  RAM-disk  based,  power-conditioned,   packaged 
machine,  with  industry-standard  ASCII terminal.  No  loss  of  data,  ever!
That's main feature, plus speed--four to six times faster than best hard disk.
Uses a floppy drive for backup storage to battery-protected dynamic RAM.  Pull 
plug out of wall, data in RAM is safe.  No loss of data, with blinding  speed!
That's what Oneac "ON!" computer is about--it's always on, always ready, never 
switched off, never quits.  No booting, everything is always loaded!   Indeed, 
there's  nothing  like  it  on the market...and you can't  get  it  by  adding 
hardware to existing computers.  Security and speed is obtained by  ingenious, 
integrated  hardware/software  design.   And  it's dead  quiet,  no  fans,  no 
acoustic  noise.  Efficient and attractive office-place styling!   Nothing  we 
have  seen  matches it.  Machine comes in two versions:  2 or 4  megabytes  of 
DRAM with 5.25" DSDD 96tpi floppy for backup.
     Programmers  developing  software and  business  professionals,  writers, 
authors,  lawyers,  engineers,  journalists, love ON! machine  for  its  mind-
altering speed and for data safety.  Office managers and secretaries love  ON! 
for ease of use and ten times faster operations compared to IBM and Apple.  No 
one  likes  to  wait, and wait, for computers to finish  simple  tasks.  Human 
creativity at-its-peak produced ON! computer.

      "For  the work you have to do.  If you have tried using a  computer 
      to  get  your  important work done you already  know  the  problem.  
      Getting  started is, at best, painful and very time consuming.   If 
      you are among the minority that has taken the time to overcome  the 
      problems of getting started, you have found that, as an experienced 
      user,  your time is being eroded by inefficient system  operations, 
      slow  execution times, occasional disasters, and  ongoing  software 
      difficulties...  ON! is the only computer specifically designed  to 
      get the work you have to do done without wasting your time."

     ON! computer, conceived and designed by Nick DeWolf, Aspen, CO, sells for 
$2,000.00  or  so.   That's  less  than you  would  think  for  such  quality, 
reliability,  and speed.  Remember, it's shipping.  Call or write Oneac's  Mr. 
Byron  Brooks,  VP Marketing, 27944 N. Bradley Road, Libertyville,  IL  60048, 
312/680-5999,  for literature with complete details.  Oh!  ON!  runs  Z-System 
with  fully  developed menus and suspended program operations.   Has  internal 
clock   to  activate  preset  commands,  auto-date/time  stamp   files,   turn 
peripherals  on/off.  Comes with Newword, V-Spell, and SuperCalc, and over  50 
utilities--all come-alive with quick menu drive!  Everything is ready to run--
preconfigured--no installation.

Z  TIPS.   Though recently moved to Bellevue, WA, Dreas Nielsen finds time  to 
develop  code,  to  make significant ZCPR3 shell  utility  contributions.   1) 
GETVAR  prints a user-defined prompt, accepts a response, and assigns it to  a 
user-defined  shell  variable,  and 2) RESOLVE resolves  references  to  shell 
variables,  System Files, register values, and other quantities from  aliases, 
ZEX  files,  etc.  Standard Z3 HLP file is supplied.  Shell utilities  are  in 
SHUTILS.LBR on Z-Nodes.  Thanks, Dreas, we needed these!                 
     Steve Kitahata, Z-Node #57 Sysop, Gardena, CA, locates and removes  long-
standing  bug in LDR13.COM.  Seems that especially for short  segments,  e.g., 
128-byte  TCAP,  1.3 can overlap into next buffer area if  load  error  occurs 
because  segment code is either too lengthy for space allocated or  defective.
One  less bug to worry about...thanks, Steve, for your efforts--keep  'em  up!
Get file LDR14.LBR for update.                            
     Rea  Williams,  Z-Node  #10 Sysop, is first to create  Index  to  Z-News.
Others,  including EI staff, are working on similar things.  So, soon we  will 
have  a  good set of indices, long needed, to assist finding subjects  in  the 
newsletters.  Our cup runs over.  Rea's Index is file ZNEWS01.IDX on Z-Nodes.
     Anyone  looking for the best in hard-disk add-ons (semiconductor  RAM  is 
not for everyone, yet) should write or call Advanced Concepts Engineering  and 
Consulting,  8926 S.W. 17 Street, Boca Raton, FL 33433, 305/482-7302.   ACEC's 
install  program  permits  configuring hard drive to your  computer,  to  your 
liking.   We  are  told  installations are  Z-System  compatible!   They  have 
versions  for many popular CP/M machines, e.g, Kaypro, Osborne, Xerox,  Eagle, 
Sanyo, Zorba, etc.  Tell'em Echelon sent you.                               

From Our Mail Box.   "The knowledge I have gained personally from  ZCPR3-ZRDOS 
use cannot be overstated.  Thanks a million...I shall be waiting anxiously for 
your coming goodies.  The best of success to the entire Echelon team in  their 
future  efforts."  Art Welsh writes from Anchorage, Alaska.  Thanks, Art,  for 
the  kind  words;  we move on the goodies as fast  as  our  resources  permit.
Remember though, it is you driving us and controlling what we do--without  you 
we are nothing.
     From Joseph Hance, Miamisburg, OH, "...purchased... ZCPR3 and  SYSLIB3... 
what is your update procedure to receive latest versions of your products?"  A 
question  asked  by  many:  we replied in Z-News 403 to get a  modem  and  get 
online,  it's 1986.  Well, here's a more considered answer.  Upgrades  to  any 
single  or  two-disk  program  is $20.00 plus  $4.00  shipping  and  handling, 
continental  USA.   Each  additional disk, if in same  shipment  and  of  same 
program, is $10.00.
     Take  our situation, Joseph, into full account: we have a master  set  of 
over  50  disks containing our products.  We handle 10 or so  floppy  formats.
Tools and programs are constantly being improved, bugs fixed.  Price of  basic 
Z-System, $192.50, is low considering how many disks, thirteen (13) SSDD  5.25 
inchers,  and how much software customer receives.  The Libraries  package  is 
shipped on 8 disks and sells for only $69.00.  Clerical problem of maintaining 
records  of  exactly what version of each utility and  program  each  customer 
received  exceeds  our  corporate capability.  Z-Nodes  are  main  source  for 
updates  to software we release to SIG/M of ACGNJ (Amateur Computer  Group  of 
New Jersey), the software for private use and not to be sold without a license 
from  Echelon.  We deal with, handle more source code than  any  microcomputer 
software  house we know of; perhaps AT&T and IBM are exceptions.   Suggestions 
to improve our service are welcomed.

Z-Node  Activity.    Calls to Z-Node system are estimated at near  40,000  per 
month--many magazines wish for such coverage!  Twenty-six (26) callers per day 
per telephone line installed--26, magic number!  Many days, up to 45 calls are 
received;  but, on a monthly average, a Z-Node line can sustain 26  calls  per 
day.   That seems to be it!  And all nodes are not operating at capacity.   If 
they were, we would be getting close to 55,000 calls per month.  Lots of  open 
time, so give your local node a call.
     George  Reeves becomes Z-Node #67, Decatur, GA 30030, complements  Z-Node 
#46  Sysop Jim Altman in nearby Atlanta.  George uses both CCS  and  TeleVideo 
microcomputers  and will use one of them as his node covering ZRDOS and  ZCPR3 
software.  His number will be passed on as soon as he is up and running.
     Z-Nodes  58,  63, and 65 become downloaders of EI  proprietary  software.
Support  your  local  downloader.   He  is  your  best  source  for   Z-System 
information.

Potpourri.    Z-Team member, John Forker, has finished his upgrade  of  SB180.
We documented changes, have given them to Micromint and NAOG (see Z-News 308), 
and  have placed changes-only into the public domain.  Upgrade consists of  1) 
removing  wait-states from hardware speeding machine by 30%, 2)  adding  256k-
bytes  of  DRAM  on-board using piggy-back chips, and 3)  modifying  BIOS  and 
system  support utilities to automatically use extra memory as  416k-byte  RAM 
disk.   New  software works with or without memory-chip addition.   John  made 
many  changes  to his liking to ROM monitor, BIOS, and  other  utilities.   We 
don't  recommend  trying  to make John's suggested changes unless  you  are  a 
qualified electronics technician.  If you feel unqualified but still want  the 
changes,   obtain  NAOG's  advice  (215/443-9031)  on  getting  complete   job 
performed--please, don't call Echelon.                               
     It's  no wonder computer users, once seeing performance of certain  8-bit 
systems,  are  migrating  from Apple and IBM PCs to S-100  and  SBCs:   Ampro, 
Micromint,  Intelligent Computer Designs, Zicomp, Dean Micro  Systems,  Magnum 
Digital,  etc.   Old timers are returning home, too!  Speed  and  quality  are 
common  denominators.   Let's  face it--those who write code  for  other  than 
certain 8-bit machines, it seems, have little or no love for their work.  Thus 
we  see  what we have been getting--software needing more  and  more  hardware 
resources, software encouraging no-think, consumption-only mentality!

Of Cabbage and Kings.   We discussed            
money's nature in Z-News 305, pg 5.  Many       
did not understand what we were getting         
at: what is money and what is stealing!         
Let's move to another level and approach        
subject from different angle.  People           
morally (what's right, what's wrong)            
develop from birth--it's predictable--by        
degrees!  We don't necessarily all start        
from same point either.  1) Right is blind      
obedience to rules and authority, based on      
fear of punishment.  Stealing is wrong          
only if we might get caught.  2) Right is       
serving one's own or one's group needs and      
making fair deals.  3) Right is playing         
the good (don't rock-the-boat) role, being      
loyal, and being motivated to follow rules      
and expectations.  4) Right is doing one's      
duty to society (the majority understand        
ing) and to one's own group.  5) Right is       
upholding the values of society, even when      
they conflict with one's group rules.  6)       
Right is defined by one's own ethical           
principles, and 7) Right is beholding           
what's good for the Cosmos and acting           
accordingly.  Thus, concern for self            
moves, as we grow, to concern for society,      
the greater good for the greater number,        
from individual instances to general            
rules.  Only a minority of adults reach         
mentality and understanding of 5) and 6),       
and during any period (epoch), less than        
100 people, world-wide, reach 7).               
   Moral development determines how a           
person (re)acts in practical situations,        
every situation.  We all steal one way or       
the other, but do we give back in kind or       
not?  Do we promote Life or do we assist        
killing it?  We know the answer if we but       
still ourselves...we don't always have to 
react, to be like fleas on a hot tin roof, 
reacting to stimulation--act, we can with  
will and understanding.                    
   What constitutes the Whole?  Integrity, 
Z-News 307 and 308 replied, is the answer. 
Z-News 308 spoke of plagiarism as basic to 
culture and what it morally means.  Philo- 
sophically, psychologically, Z-News 302    
through 305, and 308, hit us squarely in-  
the-teeth.  Our armor plate buckled, darts 
pierced bare flesh.  Now what do we do,    
how do we (re)act?                         
   Days grow long, Spring is here; but, we
don't get smarter--we are attached to our  
tread-mill life.  We treasure not colors   
of Autumn; aromas of last Summer go unre-  
membered in our haste to "make a living."  
But we live not!  We are not much more     
than automatons or cyborgs.  But why not   
choose to live and do it deeply, with      
making-a-living the fall-out.  Everything  
is available: facts, data, information,    
knowledge for the asking, and for the      
experience.  Let us turn-on our brains, so 
long on auto-pilot (our subconscious mind, 
the autonomous nervous system), and choose 
consciously.  Question everything!  Stop,  
observe, listen.  Wait, accept not first   
answers, argue with yourself--a sure way   
to receive answers that last, really last, 
ones we know are correct for us.  Let us   
BEcome more than what we presently are!
