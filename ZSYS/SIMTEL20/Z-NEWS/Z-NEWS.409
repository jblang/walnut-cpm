HD64180-Based  Development  System.   Now offered:  a  high-performance  8-bit 
software/hardware  development  station, plus graphics  with  Hitachi  HD63484 
display controller chip (see Z-News 105 and 205).  System uses STE P2 bus  and 
cards (IEEE P1000).  Graphics firmware within-chip contains easy-to-use  high-
level command set.  RS-170 video interface with horizontal/vertical scrolling, 
and 0-15 zoom factors.  Full bit-mapped characters stored in onboard 128k-word 
frame  buffer,  expandable  as  necessary,  with  many  rotation  orientations 
permitted  and  totally  flexible fonts.  Screen refresh rates are  up  to  2-
megapixels per second, full-color and monochrome, at 1,024-by-1,024 pixel res-
olution.
     Quantity one pricing: CPU board is $595; graphics, $995.  (Wonder what  a 
good  monitor costs.)  Plug-in board-based computing machines, from boards  to 
fully packaged development stations, are offered by Performance  Interconnect, 
Inc., 8950 Villa La Jolla, Suite 2144, La Jolla, CA 92037, 619/457-0665.   PII 
has  as  much enthusiasm for Hitachi chip-pair as Echelon,  because  chip-pair 
makes  for really low-cost workstations with hi-res graphics.  Move over  Sun, 
DEC,  and  Apollo; your time is up.  As bonus, STE computer  system  is  ideal 
(efficient,  economical)  for  developing ROMable  code  for  process  control 
applications  using  Quick-Task realtime kernel (Z-News 407, Price  List  Item 
16).
     You  know  European-fostered  STD  and VME  busses  and  American  S-100, 
Multibus,  Q-bus, plus others.  Now, again from Europe, we get STE  bus  (STA, 
STB...STD  came  earlier); Dean Micro Systems of England supports  STE,  along 
with  other common-market companies.  STE is physically usually  one-half  VME 
bus card size, using a DIN 41612 Euroconnector--only one, not two as VME does.
One  CPU  card controlling one graphics card, for this  we  waited.   (Quadram 
Corporation  went  another way and missed a huge market.  Z-News 204  and  205 
tells of their being ready-for-production, but they took not that next  step.)
Thanks  to  Mr.  Harry  White, PII President,  and  Colin  Hirayama,  Software 
Development  Chief,  for appreciating power of Z-System (ZRDOS  combined  with 
ZCPR3) over CP/M, MS-DOS, and Unix.
     Mr. Brooks Morck, Director of Sales, has more details and some  beautiful 
literature.  Write or give him a call.  Be sure to tell PII Echelon sent you.

Z  TIPS.    Release of ZCPR Version 3.3 should end confusion caused  by  error 
message flag phasing.  ZCPR3: The Manual states phasing, and later versions of 
the FCPs handle it, correctly.  Early FCPs, before 1.2, and Term3 1.0 and  1.1 
handle  flag incorrectly.  In any event, if ER doesn't work in a command  line 
for you, try adding or deleting the negating tilde, "~", in front of the "ER."
That  should  solve  the problem.  All our programs and  utilities  have  been 
converted  to work way book says they should--well, almost...there are  a  few 
errors in the book.  ZCPR33 first forms foundation for B3 and S3; then, B3 for 
M3 (Z-News 401).
     Echelon  pays  top  royalties (10% to 40% of  sales  price)  to  software 
authors  and  companies for exclusive rights to market their  products  taking 
full  advantage of Z-System operating environment.  If you have such  programs 
or  have some good ideas for one or more, please contact us.  We will let  you 
know the prospects.  (We seek an assembler-editor combination that  "on-error" 
enters  the  editor at source code line of first error, that  knows  assembler 
syntax!)
     Dave McCord has finished first Echelon Application Note--"ZCPR3 Shells"--
extends  information  contained in our other documentation.   In  addition  to 
explaining what a shell is, it shows how to use them.  It's file ZAPN#1.LBR on 
Z-Nodes.

Computers,  computers.   Benchmarks for many popular computers  produced  with 
"Scan," to measure file handling times using an editor or wordprocessor.  File 
is  68k-bytes of ASCII text.  Test shows how long, in seconds, it takes to  go 
from top of file to bottom and back, WordStar ^QC followed by ^QR--a real  I/O 
and  data block handling test.  Hard disk, RAM or floppy disk and  quality  of 
BIOS tell here.  We consider this test more important than others because text 
is  managed by more people, word workers, than is number crunching.  Sieve  is 
standard,  ever-popular  benchmark  here run under GW and  MBASIC,  from  BYTE 
magazine  January 1983, pages 283-326.  Additionally, we  included  benchmarks 
from Micro Cornucopia's three Aztec C programs listed in Issue #29,  April-May 
1986, pages 32 and 33.  Thanks Micro C!  Bench 1 concentrates on simple  math, 
Bench  2  on  CPU loop-and-compare operations, and most  important,  Bench  3, 
character Input/Output to console.

Analyze meaning of numbers--draw your conclusions.  Some numbers come from  Z-
News  004, 105, 107, and 208.  We sorted on Scan and secondarily on  Bench  3, 
believing  text processing and screen scrolling more important to most  of  us 
than  number  crunching.   We trust you realize  you  can  have-your-way  with 
benchmark results, depending on your perspective and motives.  "When in doubt, 
tell the truth... ", Mark Twain.  Except as noted all machines ran hard disks.
     Blue  Lightin'  and RPM2 are IBM clones running CP/M-80.   Symmetric  375 
costs  approximately  $10,000.00 but comes with 50-megabyte hard drive  and  2 
megabytes  of DRAM.  And it's a portable weighing but 20 pounds.   Interested?

Jose, CA 95131, 408/279-0700.
     We used WordStar, Version 3.0, for Scan with Z-System and CP/M  machines.
Aztec C is used because it is Unix V7 compatible, making comparison easy  with 
non-CP/M machines.  BDS-C and C/80 produce quicker executing code (see  Z-News 
306  for comparison).  Our world needs a C compiler to handle  64180  multiply 
instruction directly--Leor Zolman, you ready?  Since 16-bit multiply with  32-
bit  result is as fast as an 8086 it would show well in Bench 1  results.   We 
are  certain Borland's Modula-2 uses MLT.  Bench 1, 2, and 3 clearly  indicate 
Aztec  C as inefficient compiler for 8-bit machines, far more than  BDS-C  and 
C/80  are.   When you have resources and time to spare C,  Pascal,  and  BASIC 
programs  are okay for quick-and-dirty tasks--but for  high-performance  8-bit 
programs, let's do our programming using Assembler and SYSLIB3 (The Libraries) 
and then compare with 16/32-bit machines.  If you have hardware to fill blanks 
in above table we would like receiving your test results.
     For more IBM PC versus Z80 Kaypro comparisons, read Ted Silveira's  "Flea 
Market:  Why Bother with CP/M?" column in Profiles, January 1986 issue.   It's 
eye-opening.   As  time  and  circumstances  permit,  several  more  important 
benchmarks,  e.g.,  file save, will be collected.  That's where  IBM  PCs  and 
Apple "raincoats" really seem to fall apart.
     Finally, thanks to Ivan Strand, Berkeley, and John Forker, Los Altos, for 
their assistance in developing these comparisons.

From  Our Mail Box.   Yes, Micro Cornucopia magazine moves in many  directions 
at  once.   Tony  Bove  of erstwhile User's Guide  magazine  and  defunct  TUG 
publishing "empire" walked same path...we predict--we hope we are wrong--Micro 
C  soon  goes  "slick" with Madison Avenue  style  coated-paper  pages.   Tony 
couldn't be satisfied with 22,000 paid subscribers, as couldn't Ziff-Davis (Z-
News  108  tells  what we think Z-D people) with 60,000  to  Microsystems  and 
600,000  to  Computers and Electronics...these individuals and  companies,  it 
seems,  have little or no soul, only want to make money as primary goal,  only 
goal.  They promote status quo or they kill Life, take your choice.  Each,  of 
course, claimed they patronize leading-edge technology developments.  Baloney, 
they  champion  majority mediocrity...think of weeping and gnashing  of  teeth 
caused  by  Z-D and Tug.  We pray Micro C strikes a proper balance.   Now  The 
Computer  Journal  and its publisher, Art Carlson (mentioned in  Z-News  401), 
seem  substance for Life--Art thinks long thoughts--and we like that.   Z-News 
007  declared  support for several magazines; only one remain  of  that  early 
group.   Presently, we encourage The Computer Journal, Micro/Systems  Journal, 
and BYTE magazines.  Dr. Dobb's Journal, because of Lisa Boudreau, soon should 
return to our list.  All you silent CP/Mers and high-performance 8-bit  micro-
computer  users, speak up!  Let these and other publishers know your  feelings 
about what they do. 

Potpourri.   Z-News 403 reviews V-Spell spelling checker and corrector program 
from  CompuView Products, Inc., 1955 Pauline Blvd., Suite 300, Ann Arbor,  MI, 
48103,  313/996-1299.  We say we like it but give no price.  It's  $79.00  and 
overall  the  best,  presently.   (CommpView  is  famous  for  Vedit  Plus,  " 
systems."   writes Dreas Nielsen, Bellevue, WA.  Vedit Plus is  pricey,  sells 
for  $225.00  but  comes bundled with V-Print, a super  text  formatter  which 
recently sold for $120.00.)  Much quality 8-bit software on and for sale!
     Incidentally,  Newstar  Software,  Inc.,  moves  to  3351  Vincent  Road, 
Pleasant  Hill, CA 94523.  We reviewed their wordprocessor in Z-News  402  and 
403.  They offer, to those buying Newword (price is only $125.00), competitive 
spelling checker for $49.00, The WORD Plus from Oasis Systems, Wayne  Holder's 
company.   Both  sure bargains!  Remember, Newword  controls  laser  printers.

     Toshiba shipping 1-megabit dynamic CMOS DRAM chips (1Mb x 1) with  access 
speeds  of either 100 or 120 nanoseconds.  Also shipping 256k-bit static  CMOS 
(32Kb x 8) at same access speeds.  Next generation of memory densities  firmly 
established--Wow!.
     Thanks  to SCSI supporter, streaming tape drive people, especially  Danny 
Lamb, of Cipher Data Products, San Diego, CA, for signing up for Z-System site 
license.   We  appreciate your business.  Hope you like our ZCPR3/S3  when  it 
comes out.
     And ZRDOS, Version 1.4, is released.  Version eliminates drive select and 
data  allocation problems that occur with some computer BIOS  implementations.
Also adds hard disk feature of not logging in directory on warm boot--quickens 
transition  from application programs that re-boot on exit, return to menu  or 
to Z-System prompt.  Several other small enhancements have been  incorporated.
Thanks  go to Dennis Wright for improvements.  Anyone wishing upgrade,  please 
send  your original ZRDOS program disk, Version 1.0, 1.1, or 1.2, and  $20.00, 
plus  applicable  tax (if California) and shipping and handling  fees.   Those 
with 1.3 receive update for only shipping and handling fee.

Of  Cabbages and Kings.   Some of us, noticeably those with  advanced  college 
degrees,  seem  to  think  we  know-it-all.  Let it  be  asked:   why  are  we 
discontent with our lives if we know?  Some people live and die happy;  others 
are  happy to die!  Let's face it--we know little of Value.  We know  not  one 
thing with absolute certainty.  We make not friends; we know not ourselves  as 
friends.   We,  of  all,  are in-the-bind because we  spent  time  and  energy 
"learning"  and know so little.  Result: as product of system, we are part  of 
problem  (we believe we know), not a solution.  Think--yesterday caused  today 
and  tomorrow is nothing more than today psychologically re-played,  unless...
Face it!  See you down the lines...
