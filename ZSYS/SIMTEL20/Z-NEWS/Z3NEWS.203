Z  TIPS:  VFILER Files display!   A  somewhat three-dimensional-display effect
is achieved as  current-file  pointer  moves up/down/right/left,  because file
name  in  upper  right  screen corner simultaneously changes.  If more than 72
files are in a directory, simply pressing + or ^A  and  - or ^F moves  display
up/down to next screen,  respectively.   (Newsletters 104 and 202 have more on
VFILER operations.)

  Command (? = Help): XHZWMTYS


VFILER  sample  display is shortened for space sake...actual is up to 18  file 
rows of four columns (72 files per screen).  (Yes, Version 3.5 is on Z-Nodes.)
     VFILER  is  a ZCPR3 shell.   Shells are soft(ware)  covers  that  provide 
different  interfaces from standard.   Additionally,  shells perform functions 
and  execute  commands always knowing how to return  to  their  origins.   For 
example, VFILER uses a set of single or double keystrokes to automate file and 
disk housekeeping operations.  Also a macro language permits complex series of 
events  to  occur  from  but  a single keystroke  entered  by  the  user--yes, 
drastically  changed interface from that available at Z-System  command  line!
Other important shells are MENU,  VMENU,  ALIAS,  SH and HELP.  Each provide a 
special  interface  to  quicken and ease tasks to  be  performed.   We've  not 
discussed SH and HELP but they soon get their turn in Z-News.
     The Z command line is always just a keystroke away while using VFILER (or 
VMENU and MENU).  Type Z and you are there!  When your commands have executed, 
you   return  automatically  to  VFILER  Files  display,   ready  to  continue 
processing.
     Next  tip:   Dreas Nielsen (Corvallis,  OR) has used his imagination  and 
created a menu driven environment using aliases,  Zex and Vmenu.  His concepts 
demonstrate latent power of ZCPR3,  using GET,  GO, REG, SH, SHDEFINE, SHCTRL, 
SHSET  (makes  a program or alias  into  a  shell),  SHVAR,  SHEXIT,  SETFILE, 
IF/ELSE/FI/XIF,  GOTO,  and ECHO.   WOW!.  Here's complete VMN menu used (four 
rows of four files per row display at top):

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
Arrow keys move current file pointer

                            FILE QUEUE MANAGER
Š      Q  Add file to queue       R  Run      all files in queue
      V  View queue              T  Type      "    "    "   "
      E  Empty queue             A  Assemble  "    "    "    "
      X  Exit                    S  Specially process queued files

  Command (CR=Menu) - XHZWMTYS

Q.COM  starts menu display of MENU.VMN on your current disk with VMENU.COM and 
rest of ZCPR3 utilities along your search path.   We suggest putting them out-
of-the-way  in  A15:ROOT directory.   A file is placed in queue  (tagged)  for 
processing using Q,  the current file pointed to;  pressing E removes all such 
files from queue.
     VMENU  shows sixteen files at once,  with "+" and "-" used to  get  more.
You  can log into VMENU using wild card file declaration to select only  those 
pertinent.   Bottom  two-thirds  of screen is for single-stroke menu  display; 
last is command line.   (See Z-News 106 for VMENU,  MENU,  and VFILER features 
comparison.)
     After  queuing-up each file by moving pointer and pressing Q,  files  are 
"processed" by pressing R,  T,  A,  or S.   If S, you are prompted for command 
name,  e.g.,  PRINT.COM and trailing options (parameters).  Of course, you may 
add  other processes and commands may be added to the VMENU command  list  for 
your special needs.
     Bravo!    QUEUE   takes  Z  users  to  another  level  of  task/interface 
abstraction.  Concept works best using RAM or fast hard disk!  The Z community 
has much to ponder, learn from contributions of Dreas Nielson.
     Look for file QUEUE.LBR on Z-Nodes; Dreas' complete works are there.  His 
aliases  may be used as-are by installing to your system using Z3INS and  your 
ENV descriptor.

Z-Node #15 needs more callers!  Chicago area computerists have local access to

offered your modem port.

Software  Support:   If you have ZCPR3 configured for your  machine  and  your 
machine  is  special and not in our ARCHIVE library of  pre-configured  files, 
please  put  collection  into LBR file (using LU or NULU) and  upload  to  the 
nearest  Z-Node.   (See Z-News 108,  page 3,  for what we already have.)  We'd 
like others to benefit from your work!
     Programs  and utilities for which we supply source code  we  welcome,  we 
invite   users  to  upgrade...we  don't  expect  fixes  or  upgrades  to   our 
proprietary  programs,  programs for which we supply only  object  code,  like 
Discat,  Z-Com,  Zas,  etc.   (We  are fully responsible for fixing bugs in  a 
timely fashion and for improving these.)
     We request you notify Z-Node Central (Dave McCord,  Sysop) of your desire 
to  change a Z-System program;  only one person at a time works on each  file.
You  "check-out"  a file for up to a month,  return it for  approval,  and  if 
accepted, changes you made become official distribution.
     Features  you would like added to upcoming revisions of Core,  Utilities, 
and  Tools,  should be jotted down and sent to us.   We'll  analyze  universal 
desirability of suggestions and act accordingly.   Thus,  Z expands as we grow 
together  in understanding,  creating a computing environment paralleling  our 
mental, intellectual capacity.  What other software company acts like Echelon?
And what other company handles the quantity of program code that we do?Š
Amateur_Z_User's_Corner:   Automating your routine computer tasks is  exciting 
and saves much time in the long run.   Remember when setting up,  writing CMD, 
MENU,  VMENU files to always declare files as current directory,  using $D$U:, 
or  have  the files along your search path.   Also get a feel  for  difference 
between current and default drive.   Notice Z command line default versus what 
shows  on VFILER Files display,  upper left screen corner.   Change default by 
logging in drive,  e.g.,  A0>B:<cr> or A0:BASE>B:<cr>.   It's never been  made 
clear  the  difference  between default (logged in)  and  current  drive.   At 
operating system command line the default disk is determined; from application 
programs, current.
     If  you  haven't yet invested in an expensive text processor/editor  like 
Vedit,  PMate,  or WordStar,  you may want to look into VDO,  Version 2.5,  by 
James H.  Whorton.  It is full-screen, fast, memory-based, and has nearly same 
editing  commands  as WordStar.   Though not a word  processor,  it  makes  an 
efficient program editor.  Enhancements are presently on James' drawing board, 
so  we  can expect an even more powerful editor soon.   Complete  VDO  package 
(terminal  install,  documentation,  and  object  files)  is  on  Z-Nodes  for 
downloading as file VDO25.LBR, and is highly recommended by Echelon.  (We also 
like  split-screen,  two-files-at-a-time MIX editor,  from MIX Software,  2116 
East Arapaho,  Suite 363,  Richardson, TX 75081, toll free 1-800-622-4070, for 
$29.95 plus $5.00 shipping costs.)

FLASH:  Wyse Technology (3040 N.  First Street,  San Jose,  CA 95134, 408/946-
3075) continues to delightfully surprise us.   Their new WY-350, 64-color, 15" 
screen terminal, is fully upward compatible with the WY-50.  The monochromatic 
attributes  of the 50 are automatically converted to one of 16  default  color 
combinations.   Defaults are under operator control through palette selection. 
Thus,  software that runs with popular mono-color terminals also work with the 
350!  These Wyse terminals operate at 38,400 baud (complete screen re-write in 
half  second) with line drawing graphics.   Certainly here is an alternate  to 
slow  bit-mapped monitors.   (Wyse has been shipping 20,000 terminals a month, 
independent manufacturer leader.)

Spreadsheets,  blessing and plague:  In many cases,  because of certain innate 
human  feelings (based usually on non-understanding) that computers  can't  be 
wrong,  their output is regarded far more authoritative,  dependable (at least 
in  our minds) than actual results should warrant.   Many seem to take results 
at  face  value,  caring  not how they were  obtained.   (See  Z-News  201  re 
judgement:   of  what  value results if we don't understand how  results  were 
attained!)   Who set-up the spreadsheet template?   On what principles was  it 
formed?   Where is description of design criteria?   What numerical ranges are 
valid for calculations, zero to plus/minus infinity?  Who checked results with 
real-world, known-to-be-correct situations?
     Do  we  want  to be users of tools without enjoying the  fruits  of  more 
understanding, want to be mechanical drones?  We think not and we will not, if 
we are mindful of what's happening!

Digital Research (Pacific Grove,  CA) acts like drunken sailors returning from 
leave,  back  on  ship remembering when pockets were full,  girls across  lap, 
beers on table.   Their expenditures for fancy buildings and networks are  not 
stopping  them from laying off hundreds of employees or stopping revenue loss. 
What has happened to them?   They crusaded without principle,  worked to  just 
make money?   They cared not for the well being of their thousands of existing 
customers?   What  business  principle has DRI followed since coming out  with 
CP/M-86 and Microsoft with MS-DOS?   They position Concurrent DOS-286  against ŠUNIX System V?  Lots-a luck!

                     How we thrilled to see micros push and pull,
                                Flipping and flopping,
                    While IBM caved-in to distributed processing.
                         Yes, we love those days so splendid,
                      Full of unexpected and delightful treats,
                          When CP/M reigned tall and candid,
                         But now Z-System walks the streets!

We write Z-News from beautiful hills of Los Altos...these hills are alive with 
sounds of wonderment...we tread paths of new knowledge--join us!

See you down the lines...
