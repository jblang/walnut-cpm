Z TIPS:  Directly from Richard Conn comes advice:  "Both MENU/VMENU tools lock 
onto the current directory when they run.  To switch DIRs under them, you have 
to  issue  a command like:   SHCTRL POP;DU:;VMENU *.* fn.VMN<cr> so  that  old 
VMENU shell (in this case) is popped off the stack, DU switch is done, and new 
VMENU is run.  It has always been this way.  The Manual discusses this topic." 
Lots of users are pushing menus under Z-System to upper limits.  Still, built-
in  fundamental flexibility of ZCPR3 permits you to do what you want,  if  you 
know how.  Manual has many answers, a top source for understanding.
     You  use IFs and GOTOs in loops:   chances are you'll need XIF.   Testing 
within a loop may leave many pending IFs.   But XIF cancels all IFs,  allowing 
fresh loop start.
     Program  DEBUGRCP.ASM  is  available on  Z-Nodes  for  downloading.   For 
assembly  language  programmers...get,  assemble,  and  use  as  a  temporary, 
dynamically loaded,   RCP to debug your programs...it's MU3, but resident!  T-
h-i-n-k of all the ZCPR3 alias possibilities!   Also,  VERROR, now in style of 
VMENU,  VTYPE, and VALIAS, is also up.  And Jay Sage (Z-Node #3) has his first 
issue  (not yet official) of ARUNZ out--like LRUNZ is to COM  files,  but  for 
aliases under Z-System!

PUBLIC  Issue:   After much soul searching,  we decided to implement a  public 
facility  in  ZRDOS.   But instead of making files public,  we chose  to  make 
public  operator-specified  DIRECTORIES (disk/user areas)!  We felt  this  new 
approach better and with less hassle than any other.  No special utilities are 
needed to manage the facility--only one new tool that make DUs and DIRs public 
at the user's direction.  You simply place all your programs that use overlays 
and special (CMD) files, e.g., dBASE, Word Plus, WordStar, etc., into selected 
public  DIRs--there's  up to 32 available--along search  path.   The  rest  is 
automatic,  ZCPR3 style.   COM files and associated overlays don't necessarily 
have to be in same DIR.  COM files may be in any DIR along path.  Overlays and 
special command files are placed in DIRs that were specified as public.
     We  depart  from intentions expressed earlier because we  believe  course 
taken  now is best,  with continued full wheel-byte security (see Z-News 206).
Both  ZRDOS and ZRDOS Plus have new (never previously implemented  by  anyone) 
public  directory capability--shipping from stock at previous prices of $49.50 
and $59.50,  respectively.   Updates at usual $20.00 price, with your original 
program disk.

We_Get_Letters:  From Joe Silvia,  Lawndale,  CA, "Having just returned to the 
real world of CP/M...implementation of ZCPR3...mind boggling experience...  ."
Proclaims D.  Boone,  Valley Mills,  TX, "I'm mostly interested in the news of 
Z800  [and  HD64180]  and  transfer  of  MS-DOS/PC-DOS  software  to   ZCPR3." 
Capability is coming Mr. D!
     David  Orrahood,  Owensboro,  KY,  asks,  "Will  I be able to obtain  the 
complete 'dream' CP/M computer from you and when will it be available and what 
will it cost?"  Depends on your dreams, David; we don't sell hardware, only OS 
software  upward  compatible  with CP/M-80  and  application  programs  taking 
advantage of Z-System capabilities.   The SB180 (single board computer running 
full Z-System),  available from Micromint,  Inc. (25 Terrace Drive, Vernon, CT 
06066,  1-800/635-3355),  satisfies  lots of dreamers.   It's shipping now and 
sells for from $369.00 to $499.00, depending on software option specified.  Of 
course, you need disk drives, power supply, cables, case, and terminal to make 
complete computer system.
     "ZCPR3  is  really  a must for anyone running  under  CPM-80."   This  we 
received  from  Philippe Billotte,  Casablanca,  Morocco!   Philippe  manually 
installed Z3 on a Northstar and has become a good-neighbor helper. 
     Cry for HELP!  Lee McTaggart, 212 Beecher Drive, Southbury, CT 06488, has 
a  Cache-BIOS Ithaca Intersystems S-100 computer.   Can anyone help him get  a 
manual-install version of Z-System up and running?  Here's your chance to show 
your  stuff!   A neighbor needs you to assist pushing his 8-bit system into  Z 
modern world.  HELP!
Z-Node Activity:  We now have Z-Node #41 in mid-Atlantic area (Baltimore,  MD) 
readying to serve.   Fresh Sysop,  Larry Mansfield,  should be up and  running 
soon.
     Gosh!   we  goofed!   Sysop  Charles Boghosian's correct node  number  is 
919/383-6595 in Durham, NC; Richard Rodeheaver's, 614/864-2673.
     Richard Peterson,  El Paso,  TX, Z-Node #31, now has 24 megabytes and new 
2400 bps modem online;  915/821-3638.   Ed Unrein, Z-Node #29, has a few bytes 
more,  at 30 megs,  and too has new 2400 bps modem;  305/295-0844.   These two 
nodes  are  current,  with  latest of everything coming directly  from  Z-Node 
Central; use them instead of Central, wil' ya, please!
     Convention  established:   RAS  modem/computer phone numbers  are  always 
underlined; straight voice numbers are not.

Amateur  Z User's Corner:  Disk Editor,  DU3,  is so easy to use once you  get 
over  fear of complexity.   Start first by using MU3,  the Memory  Utility  of 
ZCPR3.   The editor within DU3 is near identical to MU3, full screen oriented, 
with high-lighting and cursor arrow keys to point to byte to change.   Richard 
Conn's editor arrangement has made altering data in memory or on disk so easy, 
compared with ways of the recent past.  Gain confidence with MU3 then go on to 
learn DU3.   Use the "E" command of DU3 and notice familiarity!  Run DU3 using 
a  "scratch"  disk (one you don't mind losing data from) just in case  you  do 
things not intended!  On entering DU3, at command line, type t2;d<cr>, and you 
will  be  observing first eight lines,  16-bytes per line,  of disk  directory 
area.   Type s2;d<cr> and see next Sector!  Directory starts a Track 2, Sector 
1.   (For further information on disk track/sector organization,  read one  or 
two of many books written about CP/M systems.  We recommend "The Programmers's 
CP/M  Handbook"  written by Andy Johnson-Laird,  published by  Osborne/McGraw-
Hill.)  Just remember,  you can't hurt anything; any changes you make by using 
the editor are not put to disk until you use the "write" command, CTRL-W.

Quote under drawing, "Let us learn of Z... "

     Study  ZCPR3:  The  Manual  from pages 161 through 180 to learn  of  vast 
capabilities of disk editor.   Online help (DU3.HLP) also is useful to quickly 
remind  of commands and syntax forgotten.   Manual is best to  beginning-learn 
from;  that's why it was written,  to complement extensive,  existing,  online 
help system (more than 700 screens!) that keeps you and me learning.
     IF  and ELSE conditional testing is easily understood once (if)  idea  of 
statements  being true and false is clearly understood (see Z-News 207,  pg 2, 
discussing  true/false  situations).   If the IF  statement  (conditional)  is 
false, the ELSE verb (command) converts stored false condition to true.  Then, 
statements  containing commands-to-be-run after the ELSE are executed by  your 
computer.
    Now  tell  us,  is  walrus or is old man teaching...who  among  you  dares 
speculate?

Search  Program Review:  Needing a way to find files that contained a specific 
character string, we procured SIFT from Siftsoft, 100 Valencia, San Francisco, 
CA  94103,  415/864-8205.  Thinking it had power and flexibility we needed, we 
tried  SIFT on some complex string searches with wildcard  file  declarations. 
The  user  interface  was near perfect,  built-in syntax help  (shades  of  Z-
System),  and plenty of options--wonderful,  but for two things!   Program was 
written in BDS-C and takes 20k-bytes of memory and disk space and is slow--fat 
and  porky.   (We  suddenly  remembered  why  we  stopped,  after  18  months, 
programming  in  C.)  SIFT does things one would want a search program to  do; 
unfortunately,  doesn't do them quickly!  At $26.36 many may find it of value, 
but  our time is worth enough for us to seek an assembly language program  for 
these functions, one that makes us feel our computer isn't being abused.
     Well-meaning  producers  of  SIFT wrote a detailed  manual  telling  all, 
though  extremely  small typeface made for  laborious  reading.   In  general, 
Sifsoft  remind  us  of  those who don't bench-mark  to  find  relative  speed 
position of their product.   They likely thought since BDS-C is the fastest 8-
bit C compiler, their program would be as fast as it could be!  C programs can 
be  competitive;  but for time and mental energy it takes,  you might as  well 
have  written  it  in Assembler from the start.   That's the way  we  go  (and 
recommend)  for  other than 32/64-bit mainframe programs.   Use  SYSLIB  (con-
taining LULIB), Z3LIB, and VLIB for generating desktop application programs!

Our  Logo:   Some number of EI customers have asked what our  logo  means,  if 
anything,  and  is there any connection with eagles?   Well,  since logos  and 
eagles are dear to our hearts (and heads), we thought we'd respond publicly.
    Logo's  three  (3) horizontal lines form an abstract "E" of first  letter, 
followed  by  "i"  to  complete  initials,   of  legal  corporate  name.   The 
abstraction symbolizes triad (3) of forces working in Cosmos,  source and use, 
both  constructive  and destructive.   One echelon supports another  for  sub-
stantial  stability,  pointing  to possible  perfection.   (Stability  is  not 
absolute,  else there would be no change--no change implies perfection, truth. 
What is truth?  It's that which does not change:  truth is!)
     Smoothed  cornered,  near square border around EI letters symbolizes non-
perfect world we're in.   (A circle would imply perfection exists now!)   And, 
border is closed, reminding us that Cosmos's rate-of-change towards perfection 
is constant.
     Eagles  fly  level-to-level  stimulating graceful  change  and  interplay 
between biological and non-biological life, influence ranging from our Moon to 
our  Sun.   Few  eagles  need exist to have the  work  effective,  to  satisfy 
existing Law.   Believe it or not!   If you're between belief and no,  perhaps 
you WONDER!

Industry  Brief:   All  evidence points to Unix being a failure  for  economy, 
speed,  efficiency,  and user interface.   But that doesn't stop  you-know-who 
from continuing to push it with all their might.   The supermirco houses using 
68xxx  chips  have  been patching every port with preprocessors in  effort  to 
improve user keyboard response.   Back in Newsletter 004 we said,  "Time-share 
CPU methods used by Unix,  and the like, will not survive!  Each user with his 
own  CPU--that's the long term future."  We still believe  time-share  systems 
far-less-than-optimum,   real  losers!    A  good  local  area  network  (LAN) 
essentially  provides  parallel processing,  with throughput  proportional  to 
number of users!  You want, need more?  Mainframe (priest) mentally is hard to 
shake.  As is our general attitude toward customers and making money.
     A  business  requires  making a profit to survive--but  financial  profit 
should  not be primary goal (many other types of  profit  exist).   Certainly, 
first  goal  is  satisfying customers,  and from there certain  profits  come. 
Satisfied  customers  create  business climate that guarantees  all  kinds  of 
profits.   So what do we see in most high-technology  industries?   Technology 
for  its own sake?   Customers being duped into thinking this product or  that 
will do something to make-their-day!   Let's face it:   desktop computers have 
been oversold by those in the trade,  with customers' expectations (see Z-News 
201,  pg 3, for what earlier was said about expectations) not being fulfilled. 
Word is around,  customers have dried up!  Computers don't do what majority of 
customers thought they would.   Long live customers (and computers)!   See you 
down the lines...
