Z  Tips.    Just  a reminder to Term3,  Release  2,  users...T3MASTER/T3SERVER 
requires  an  8-bit data path to permit binary file transfers.  Such  path  is 
easily  provided  in typical BIOSs by commenting-out  the  usual  CONIN/CONOUT 
subroutine  mask that makes data 7-bit.  Scan, using your editor, for an  "ANI 
7FH" in these two routines, place a ";" to comment the lines or remove them by 
deleting entire lines.  Re-assemble your BIOS and re-install.  Or you may wish 
to  use  ZDM on an memory image of your "system" to find string  "E6  7F"  and 
replace  with two NOPs.  "E6" is op-code value for ANI.  Make sure  string  is 
near RS-232 port address, port used by computer-to-computer  connection--it'll 
be  the one we want to fix.  Then SYSGEN saved image back to outer  tracks  of 
your   boot   disk.   That's  it,  ready  to  transfer   files   over   RS-232 
console/printer-type serial ports.
     Screen  dynamics using Term3 in batch file transfer mode are  impressive.
Complete reporting, i.e., what is happening, fully screen-oriented, from  file 
synchronization  to block transfer status, file name, and cumulative and  each 
type and occurrence error-count.  KMD and Term3 work perfectly together, using 
either  128- or 1k-byte packets.  Be sure to declare batch mode  from  T3FILER 
transfer menu, or from your command line, after you make multiple-file request 
at RAS command line.

From  Our Mail Box.   Professor Leslie Clark (Edgewater, NJ), in a  thoughtful 
four-page  letter, gives sound advise on how to communicate with our vast  and 
diverse audience of Z users.  Parenthetically, "I know that I am not  stupid--
though  I  cannot  say that all professors are at all above  average  in  this 
respect,  so I make no special claims for myself...and I know my students  are 
far  smarter  than I am."  What is smart?  Understand concept  of  "levels  of 
understanding"  and  you  understand  difficulty  of  teaching  or  explaining 
anything  not already understood.  Who teaches and who learns?  Hand  holding, 
we think of.  We believe Z-System User's Guide has tutorial style Prof.  Clark 
declares  desirable.   Book  makes less assumptions  about  knowledge-base  of 
reader  than  does usual EI documentation.  Our challenge is scope  of  effort 
necessary  to  explain  everything we do from "the  beginning."   Our  English 
grammar  and style can be improved but barrier remains: scarcity of  time  and 
space in which to thoroughly explain.  We act as we do based on priorities  of 
running a business, keeping customer support reasonable, all within bounds  of 
our monetary means.  Please tell us what we should do next, over that done  by 
Z-System  User's  Guide, Price List Item 88, $14.95 plus  $4.00  shipping  and 
handling.
     We  have been asked: Yes, we like National 32332 32-bit  pipelined  chip, 
but only if it lives up to its specification.  (NS32016 is impressive  running 
Berkeley  4.2bsd Unix, see Symmetric benchmarks versus 68000 machines,  Z-News 
409  and  501.)  Might just be what we need for desktop Ada  Language  program 
development  if a compiler ever becomes available for NS32332.  Could  Richard 
and Dennis convert Z-System to run with it?  Yes, we think they could.
     On the other hand, Fairchild's 32-bit CLIPPER chip set looks interesting, 
but pricey.  Running at 33mHz, set achieves throughput of DEC VAX 8600 (equals 
five  11/780s, fifty IBM PCs with 8087), similar to out-of-production  11/785.
Floating-point  performance  exceeds one megaflop, a  million  floating  point 
calculations per second.  Uses tight 1.2 micron CMOS technology (HD64180  uses 
2.0) to achieve such high clock rates.  Certainly a next-generation  superchip 
combination.  
Š            "The best prophet for the future is the present."--Chinese Proverb

     While  on subject, let's not fail to mention, though only  having  16-bit 
bus, Performance Semiconductor Corporation's MIL-STD-1750A computer chip using 
0.8  micron  technology with metal pitch of 2.75 microns, closest  ever!   Has 
over  200,000 transistors integrated, with 0.6 microsecond  integer  multiply, 
1.1 microsecond 32-bit floating point multiply--all onchip in low-power  CMOS.
Runs  at 40mHz clock rate!  Now that's fast...for more information,  including 
prices,  call  or  write  them, 610 E. Weddell  Drive,  Sunnyvale,  CA  94089, 
408/734-9000.  Silicon-chip pioneer Tom Longo, President, wants your business. 
Company's technology is on cutting edge of microcomputer's future.  Only those 
with deep pockets need apply.
     Do  we  personally need performance offered by such  technology;  can  we 
afford it?  Again, a variation of that price versus performance question.   If 
you need it you somehow get the money to buy it.  Little life appears left for 
traditional (1966-1985) minicomputers--they get replaced by micros and  super-
micros.   But,  for up-to-medium-size activities, we feel  Z-System  supported 
computers do jobs best, with Term3 connecting to outside-world machines.
     Your  letters  are  a major source of inspiration, telling  us  what  you 
think.   Please  keep writing and sending them...you hear?  Also  write  other 
publications telling your thoughts.  Thank you!

Z-Node Activity.   Larry Mansfield, after being down for 5 months, is up  with 
his new S-100 bus Zenith Z100.  Z-Node #41, back with 10 megabytes of storage, 
supports traffic from Baltimore, MD.  Locals (and others who wish to know  how 
he  installed ZCPR3 on an 8085-based computer) should call, 301/254-6277,  and 
welcome him back.  Better luck this time (his original H89 caught fire!)  with 
your equipment, Larry.
     Coincidentally, Jay Denebeim's Z-Node #42 is called "Deep Thought 42"  as 
is super microcomputer detailed in Z-News 502.  (Recall, Jay wrote imaginative 
ZBYE,  an RCP running as BYE, a system segment answering telephone of  a  RAS, 
remote  access  bulletin  board and file-transfer  system).   Douglas  Adams's 
science  fiction  book,  Hitchhiker's  Guide to the  Galaxy,  from  merry  old 
England,  has had big impact on citizens of USA.  Surely Jay will want to  run 
his  node from a SemiDisk Systems DT42 computer!  Oh!  Wow!  What a trip  that 
would be.

Common Cause.   Let's recap where Z-System stands with hardware  manufacturers 
(OEMs) and how these companies fit into our computing marketplace.

SBC        S100                          STE                       Packaged
Ampro      Intelligent Computer Designs  Dean Micro Systems        Ampro
Micromint  Magnum Digital                Performance Interconnect  Heath/Zenith 89/90
SemiDisk                                                           Kaypro
                                                                   Oneac       Zicomp

Starting  with  Ampro.   They have a dual role,  providing  complete  computer 
systems  and  single boards from which complete systems  can  be  constructed.
Ampro is stable and conservative, providing sound, reliable hardware with full 
customer  support.   They fix what is not right, both software  and  hardware, 
with  many dealers world-wide handling their product.  You can't do better  if 
you need what their hardware provides.
     Oneac's  Z80 machines are first of RAM-based microcomputers  (Z-News  408 
and  501).  Using latest techniques, totally menu-driven system is so fast  it 
makes  so-called 16-bit machines feel harsh and seem slow.  Uniquely  designed 
for personal, small office, and programming efficiency.  It does not make  you Šwait, doesn't waste your time...it's ready when you are!
     Z80-based Kaypro becomes a modern computer with Echelon-produced bootable 
disk Z-System.  Package comes with easy to understand beginner's manual.  Keep 
your Kaypro; update with Z!
     Heath  and  Zenith  Model  H/Z89  and  H/Z90  machines  stay  young  with 
Analytical  Products  (Z-News 405 and 502) bootable disks and  enhanced  BIOS.
Acquire  Peter Shkabara's implementation to bring 89/90s into world of  second 
half of 1980s.
     Zicomp  makes an interesting multi-user Z80-based machine using Z.   More 
information can be obtained by calling or writing them, 59 Mount Hermon  Road, 
Scotts Valley, CA 95066, 408/438-1624, Mr. Sylvan Stephani, President.
     Long-of-tooth,  nonetheless  Z80s  serve well  in  cost-conscious  appli-
cations.  Most new applications use HD64180/Z180 if chip-integration functions 
are  required, results in lower overall cost--usually does, just from  printed 
circuit board space saved.  Increased performance from chip is bonus.
     Now HD64180-based single board and S-100 computers.  Hitachi chip  offers 
significant increase in performance over a Z80.  Software is just being  writ-
ten to take full advantage of its hardware features.  ZAS, ZCPR/B3 and /M3 (Z-
News  401  and  406) presently are being redesigned to  take  such  advantage.
Micromint's  SB180 has shown what a fully bundled modern OS and this chip  can 
do.  A satisfying project!  But SemiDisk's DT42 takes it to next logical step: 
high  clock rates and large amounts of fast RAM.  Just as Oneac computer  sets 
trend,  a  new way of thinking about personal computers, DT42 moves  to  other 
levels  of functionality and versatility (notice benchmarks in Z-News 409  and 
501, description in 502).
     Magnum Digital and ICD both have super S-100 boards, each with  different 
personality,  running  Z-System.  Each have advantages,  running  at  9.216mHz 
clock rates, in upgrading existing S-100 card cages.  These boards bring  new-
life, speed and flexibility, to S-100 market.
     PII  (Performance Interconnect, Inc., Z-News 409) puts the 64180  solidly 
in  the  software development, graphics work station, and  industrial  ROMable 
code  worlds.   Dean  essentially does in England what PII is  doing  in  USA, 
supporting STE and VME bus markets with 8-bit hardware and software.
     Great  flame sprang from brilliant spark, Richard Conn's  ZCPR3,  blazing 
into Z-System fueled by Dennis Wright's ZRDOS--now a roaring fire!

             "Thou hast planted them, yea, They have taken root:
                   they grow, yea, they bring forth fruit:
                        thou are near in their mouth,
                  and far from their reins."--Jeremiah 12:2

     We  come  to the decision--many have already made it  without  trying  Z-
System and experiencing its power on their machines--to be or not to be!  Most 
have  simply  presumed Z-System not as good as claimed and leaped  onto  IBM's 
band  wagon: drone using clone is order of the day, similar to situation  with 
prime-time  network  television viewing.  Such we grieve to tell  you  is  the 
case.  But we do what we can to show what Z can do, to get users involved  and 
not  simply  be  consumers.   Continue to  work  with  high-performance  8-bit 
machines--there  is  much unexplored potential in them--or go with  crowd,  go 
with IBM, decision crisis point, your moment of truth!
     Digressing,  we  were  recently asked if one should  go  beyond  using  a 
computer,  to  learn how a computer works, then how the parts  are  make,  and 
finally  into  the physics of metals and semiconductors (of  materials).   Our 
answer was "learn as much as you can, at all levels."  Therein, understanding!
Become your own expert across-the-board.
     Wondering a little.  The DT42 is a wonderful non-biological machine,  one Šfully  exploiting advantages of high-performance 8-bit software.  And  because 
it's  so  flexible you have lots of learning to go through to use it  to  full 
capability.   Many  of  us have two or more  computers  assisting  our  living 
activities.  DT42 has video monitor channel plus three (3) serial and two  (2) 
parallel ports, one a SASI; co-board has a fully implemented SCSI port.  Think 
of  the I/O Redirection opportunities and local and wide area networks  to  be 
set  up--data  and control in our hands.  You can do it with a  little  study, 
some change of attitude.
     Decisions, decisions: 1) be a consumer or 2) be a learner of what you are 
about:  completely up to you, path chosen.  "To be or not to be!"
     In  summary,  many  boards and systems exist, from Ampro  to  Zicomp,  as 
alternatives  to  "you know what."  Sadly, vast majority have  already  chosen 
without consciously understanding result of their actions.  You who stay  with 
8-bit, upward compatible to CP/M-80 systems, have lots of adventure ahead.  In 
addition to getting your work efficiently done using vast amount of  available 
software,  think  of mental trip you'll be on--truly outstanding!  We  say  no 
more...

Lunch Break.   Really good news!  High Tech Research, Bill Nesting, President, 
produces  K-20  computers.  Taking over stock of Kaypro 10s (cases  and  other 
mechanical  hardware), company manufactures 20-megabyte, TurboROM-based  8-bit 
machines   and  sells  them  for  $1,595.00.   Call  800-446-3220  (-3223   in 
California)  for more details, or write HTR, 1135 Pine Street, #103,  Redding, 
CA 96001.  We use a Seagate 225N, same as in K-20, on our Ampro and can attest 
to  the hard drive's quickness, faster than an Xebec Owl.   Nesting's  company 
also  produces Kaypro "Handyman" desktop accessory  hardware/software  package 
with  calculator,  notepad, phone auto-dialer,  appointment  calendar,  screen 
dump,  etc.   Handyman, Version 1.3, sells for $129.95 and gives  your  Kaypro 
full "Sidekick" capability.
     Potentially good news.  User's Guide magazine may be published again.  We 
did Tony Bove an injustice thinking he had abandoned our market for money  (Z-
News 409).  He relates working hard to find someone to take over the magazine.
Lo!  A potential publisher has appeared in the wings and if everything goes as 
indicated, magazine is expected off the presses soon.  Tony readily admits  to 
being neither businessman nor publisher, so hopefully, with someone to  handle 
management and finances, new magazine could be successful and stay around  for 
a long time, supporting high-performance 8-bit systems.

             "The way to show a stick is crooked is not to argue 
              about it, or spend time denouncing it, but to lay a 
                   straight stick beside it."--Dwight Moody

     May/June  1986, BYTE magazine, "Ciarcia's Circuit Cellar"  articles  tell 
just  about  everything  you ever wanted to know about  SCSI  (Small  Computer 
Systems  Interface)  bus--show  how  SB180/COMM180 uses  SCSI  for  hard  disk 
applications.   Of  course,  SCSI can be used with  devices  other  than  disk 
drives.  Also, Rick Lehrbaum, Ampro Computers, has an excellent series on SCSI 
running  in  The Computer Journal.  Started two issues back,  from  Issue  #22 
onward.   SCSI  seems to be the bus of choice these days of just  about  every 
peripheral  manufacturer.  Ampro Little Board has one, DT42 from SemiDisk  has 
one on co-board, The SemiDisk.  Most newer hard disk drives interface to SCSI, 
as do some LASER printers.  SCSI, element of high-performance 8-bit  computing 
future, we plan for it!
     A  group "specifically for ZCPR/Z-System/HD64180" users in  Colorado  has 
been  organized  by Dr. Donald Halford, a staff member of National  Bureau  of 
Standards  in Boulder.  New user's group should complement activities  of  Don ŠRoth  and CP/M SIG in Broomfield (Denver).  If interested in  joining,  please 
write or call Ronald Halford, 2840 Kenyon Circle, Boulder, CO 80303,  303/499-
7098, evenings.  Good teaching and luck to both Colorado Don's.
     Borland International, Scotts Valley, CA, nears completion of their Turbo 
Modula-2  for Z80 and HD64180 (we are a beta-test site).  Hopefully, it is  as 
good  as, if not better than, their popular Turbo Pascal (see Z-News  306  for 
more on Borland).  Such languages (and Janus Ada or FTL Modula-II for Z80 from 
Workman  &  Associates, Pasadena, CA 91106, 818/796-4401)  on  8-bit  machines 
should  satisfy  those  who  want to write programs  but  prefer  not  to  use 
Assembler or C Language.

          Speaking  of Pascal, and remembering our constant search  for 
      programs that control LASER printers, Rogers Marketing Co., 12046 
      Willowood  Drive, Woodbridge, VA 22192,  telephone  703/494-2633, 
      has  two  (in Pascal) for Cannon LBP-8 and -A2  machines  running 
      under  Z-System or CP/M.  "FontR" permits editing fonts  for  the 
      Cannon,  "PrintR" does the printing from Newword-  and  WordStar-
      created  files.   Price,  $250.00.  Desk top  publishing  is  not 
      inexpensive.   Caveat: programs work only with -8 and -A2  Cannon 
      models using Cannon Garland proportional font cartridge.   (Civil 
      Computing's "PropStar", see Z-News 304 for details, if used  with 
      Newword, does a nice job with LASER printers, and sells for  only 
      $49.95.  Yes, a lower price now than quoted in 304.)

     Sometime ago we converted our business management data to the James River 
Group  software  system  for micros.   Accounting,  general  ledger,  accounts 
receivable,  inventory,  accounts  payable, payroll, mailing  lists,  all  for 
$465.00.  We couldn't be more pleased.  Fully integrated, meeting professional 
standards,  superb  documentation,  easy to learn and  use.   JRG's  telephone 
technical support isn't lacking either--each time we've called they had  quick 
and  correct answers to our questions.  A demonstration package  is  available 
for only $18.00.  So if you are setting up a small- to medium-sized  business, 
investigate their offerings.  Write or call James River Group, 125 North First 
Street, Minneapolis, MN 55401, 612/339-2521.
     ====================================================================
Of Cabbages and Kings.   The house that learning builds gets built slowly, but 
results in a house that's solid and true.  Stacks, tagged memory, pipe  lines, 
RISC,  these  are not sufficient for Artificial Intelligence  systems  (Z-News 
205).  (Human curiosity is paramount evolutionary for-learning force--produces 
change!)  Parallel processing is useful in improving computational  efficiency 
but not in extending the solvable problem size, and that block is in our human 
minds.   We need better heuristic searching routines, reduced search  cost  in 
terms  of  computer  time  and memory--we at Echelon  push  Assembler  over  C 
Language  (and  other  high-level languages), though we like  C,  to  conserve 
hardware  resources, local memory, disk storage, and computing  duration.   Do 
the job, do it well, with minimum resources in play; that's our motto!  Prolog 
and LISP computer languages overwhelm hardware.
     More  knowledge  results in less search; but, wisdom  reduces  search  to 
zero!
     Generally,  we don't understand how it is we think, what it is to  think; 
thus, how can we built a "thinking" machine?  We watch the AI community, as we 
watch  microsystems  under the drag of IBM "leadership."  Gosh,  we  weep  for 
majority-mankind.   When will we each begin to think for ourselves,  begin  to 
stop trooping.  Japanese are ahead of us because of attention to detail in the 
mechanical  realm,  such detail as observed through their  mental  world.   We 
still  treasure things made by our human hand, but their  machine-made  things Šare  more  uniform,  fit  better, and in the long run  are  of  higher  value.
Western  emotion  plays  big part in western  problem...Japanese  have  taken, 
borrowed much from us (Z-News 305 and 408, money, stealing, and morality), but 
have  returned  much  in-kind, both of quality and  value.   Husky  levels  of 
fundamental  change  must go into our thinking, into our doings for us  to  be 
fully competitive, superior.  See you down the lines...
