EI                            Z-NEWS 706                         20 April 1987

Of Significance.   Graphics, graphics...GT180 can produce pretty pictures. See 
the  ones on page 3 of the hardcopy edition of Z-News; but reproduction  being 
still and in shades of grey, full-justice is not done to original  fast-moving 
color  pictures.   GT180 works on the XBUS of SB180 and  SB180FX  single-board 
computers  from Micromint, and XLR8 add-ons from M.A.N. Systems.   By  GT180's 
use  of  Hitachi HD63484 graphics controller chip, speed of drawing  a  multi-
color screen exceeds all the popular microcomputers, including IBM PC,  Apple, 
Atari, and Commodore.

     J.B.  Designs and Technology Ltd., 15, Market Street, Cirencester,  Glos. 
GL7  2PB, telephone 0285 68122, Telex 341374, produces a 2-card set, STE  IEE-
P1000  standard  bus  (that's a half-width VME-bus  card),  Eurocard  physical 
layout,  using  Z-System.  One card contains 6 or 8mHz HD64180  CPU,  STE  bus 
interface  with full arbitration, 16mHz STE bus clock signal, 3 byte-wide  ROM 
sockets,  realtime  clock circuit, and math processor  socket.   Second  card, 
combination called Saturn, rides piggy-back on the first, adds hard and floppy 
disk interfaces, printer interface, and 256k to one megabyte of dynamic RAM.
     Called Titan STEngine for single-card embedded applications, is a totally 
compatible  member  of  the STEngine range, an assortment  of  STE  cards  for 
realtime  applications.   Two-card combo, Saturn, is ideal  as  a  development 
system.   Both  configurations  support JBD's Industrial  BASIC  language,  an 
enhanced floating-point BASIC tailored for STE-bus products.  And  Quick-Task, 
Item 16 on our Price List, is ideal for creating multitasking ROMable code.
     Titan and Saturn are shipping now.  If interested, contact Director David 
Collier at J.B. Designs in United Kingdom.

From  Our Mail Box.   In Europe, activity is brisk for our kind of  computing.
Writes  Klas  Fagerberg, Munchen, W. Germany, "I received  the  Z-Catalog  the 
other day...I read it through without a halt...I will surely be back for  more 
software, like libraries, IOPs, disassembler, etc."  Thanks, Klas, for  order-
ing  DSD and Z-System OS documentation for your SB180.  The IOP package  is  a 
good deal for users of SB180 computers, Item 45 on Price List.  Notice aliases 
in  Z-News  609-3 and 701-3 using I/O Recorder and B/Printer, way  we  include 
console output into Z-News and background print while editing another file  or 
while doing other things.  Also NuKey comes in the package, our unique,  full-
featured  keyboard redefiner IOP segment created by Good-Neighbor Helper,  Joe 
Wright, San Jose, CA; Z-News 702-1 contains more about NuKey.  And, the  news-
letter  coming free for 6 months the first time a $49 order is  placed,  keeps 
you  informed  of happenings in our inner and outer worlds.  Back  copies  are 
available  for $12.00 per 24 different issues, plus $4.00 shipping and  handl-
ing, continental USA, actual mailing costs for rest of world.
     David  Trawick, Iowa City, IA, renewing newsletter  subscription  writes, 
"...my other comment is due to the emphasis of-late on hard disks.  All  small 
systems  are  getting them!  Why not put some of the effort and  dollars  into 
battery-backed RAM disks?"  Yes, why not!  SemiDisk and the DT42 have it.  RAM 
prices  are not coming down as fast as we expected but still 2-megabytes as  a 
RAMdisk  with  battery-backup makes for a fast and  economical  computer,  one 
which  you  don't  have to load the RAM with files each  time  you  turn  your 
machine on.  Thanks, David, for your renewal.

   In Requiem.   With deep sorrow we announce the death of Tim Linehan,  Z-
   Node #7 Sysop.  Tim was a loyal servant, a good citizen, and a concerned 
   person  of  the  highest  order.  He shall be  missed  in  the  Olympia, 
   Washington area.  We shall miss him from here in California.  He died of 
   natural  causes  at age 44.  Tim is survived, in Olympia, by  his  wife, 
   seven children, and mother, and in California by his sister and brother.

Z-Node  Activity.   After much struggle, Gregg Britton, Sysop of  Z-Node  #61, 
Whiteman  AFB, MO 65305, has his hard-disk RAS up and running correctly,  "now 
with no problems."  For those in the Missouri area, here's your ticket to save 
money by reducing long-distance charges.  Give Gregg a call, 816/563-4991, and 
let  him  assist you in further understanding the Z-System.   He's  become  an 
expert after going through the rigors of getting his Z-Node reliable.
     We intend to publish the latest Z-Node Roster in an upcoming issue of  Z-
News, for ready reference in making calls.

Software  Update Service Report.   Here's what SUS #9 looks like  at  shipping 
time.  All registered subscribers to the service should have it in their hands 
by end of this month.

Z-News  704-2, i.e., Z-News Volume 7, Issue 4, page 2, describes programs  not 
mentioned  here.   1) PRNTXT10, written by Terry Hazen, Los Gatos,  CA,  is  a 
greatly improved version of TXT, a utility that permits you to use your editor 
on a default COM file to create instant messages to screen and printer.   Con-
trol codes can be sent to the printer to control formatting.  Great for use in 
Z-System  aliases.   2)  From songster  Tony  Bennett's  City-by-the-Bay,  San 
Francisco, comes Rick Charnes's RCOM10, Repeat Command, CMD alias and tutorial 
for processing multiple files, even vanilla CP/M files,  from a single command 
line.   Uses  Jay  Sage's ARUNZ and its  parameter  passing  capability.   RC, 
similar  to  Steve Cohen's W (Z-News 508-1), handles file lists but  not  wild 
card file names.  RC and W complement each other.

     SUS  #10  is  already  nearly  filled  because  of  space  taken  up   by 
Backgrounder II demo library.  We put our new prices list and order form on it 
and  a neat send-file-to-printer ZEX script using WordStar.  That's likely  it 
for #10.  One or two small files to go.  We will ship it in a month or two.

Z-User's  Corner.   This fortnight we look at pictures created by  Micromint's 
GT180 graphics controller board.  Photos on next page were taken directly from 
a NEC Multisync monitor with a 35mm camera.  Only pictures that were still  on 
the  screen did we take.  Board is so fast that it re-writes,  i.e.,  redraws, 
complete  screen with 640 by 480 by 16-color pixel resolution in less  than  1 
second, much faster than those other popular computers.  Shown are just a  few 
photos  from our camera.  The bee, to the unaided eye, has high resolution  on 
the monitor, but its true details don't show here.
     The  Turbo Modula-2 Graphics Toolbox, an optional software  accessory  to 
the  board,  is a natural jumping-off point for custom designing  screens  for 
your applications.  It turns out TM-2 is an ideal high level graphics language 
once the primitives have been written to control the hardware--and that's  the 
case here.  All hardware driver primitives are already written.  What  remains 
is the design and artistic part, the actual drawing of the picture.
     Pascal users have no difficulty converting to TM-2.  From there the field 
is  wide open to produce outstanding application programs that take  advantage 
of Z-System features plus features of SB180 and GT180 combination.  GO FOR IT!
     As Z-News 701-1 states, more details about the GT180 are in Nov/Dec 1986, 
and  Jan  1987  BYTE  magazine.  There, see Circuit  Cellar  column  of  Steve 
Ciarcia.


     A huge montage of six photos of graphics produced by GT180--only seen
     in hardcopy edition of Z-News.


Hardware  Beat.   "Unprecedented value in 8-bit computing power."  That's  the 
way  Mr.  Don  Castella, President of Disks Plus, Inc.,  describes  his  near-
giveaway of Ampro Little Board/Plus Z80 computers.  Being priced at only  $199 
each  we agree the offer is a super bargain.  Normal list price has been  $329 
for  this popular single board computer.  Comes with ZCPR3  (ZRDOS  optional), 
Friendly  MENU shell, LZED text editor, and up-to-60-megabyte  SCSI  hard-disk 
support.  See ad in May 1987 Computer Shopper newspaper.  If interested,  call 
or  write Mr. Castella at 356 Lexington Drive, Buffalo Grove,  IL  60089-2312, 
telephone 312/537-7888, Telex 650 2139 MCI UW.
     We  are told second generation 8-page per minute laser-technology  (xero-
graphic)  Canon print engine, one used in HP's new Series II printers  (Z-News 
705-3),  has  essentially an indeterminately long life, if not abused  and  if 
normal maintenance operations are performed.  That's judged by us to be a long 
time!   Ricoh  claims major overall required at 180,000 pages--that too  is  a 
long  time, 7 or 8 years of normal small-business use, average 2000  sheets  a 
month--for  their  second  generation 6-ppm engine, used  in  Epson's  GQ-3500 
Laser,  Okidata's Laserline 6, IBM's new PS/2 laser, and Ricoh's own PC  Laser 
6000.   Each  have their unique combination of features that try to  put  dot-
matrix  and daisy-wheel impact printers and phototypesetters out of  business.
(Having one narrow- and two wide-carriage, i.e., being able to print sheets 11 
by  17 inches, 24-wire dot-matrix printers, we long for an  affordable  "wide-
carriage"  laser printer.  The only one we know of sells for $18,000,  offered 
by OEM Dataproducts.  We think Ricoh's 6-ppm engine is capable of being  rede-
signed  economically to print 11" by 17" pages.  We presently own one  narrow-
carriage laser, handles 8.5" by 14" sheets, and lease another.)
     Speaking of getting what we want: a WY-60 terminal with adjustable height 
arm.   Now  this is a good combination, the best ASCII terminal we  have  ever 
used.  Has many advanced features...WyseWorks, accessible from any program you 
are  running, contains clock with two alarm set points to alert operator  with 
on-screen  messages; calendar that shows days of week, months, and  years;  an 
ASCII table that shows hex, octal, binary, and decimal for the terminal's  255 
native-mode  primary  character set; and a four function,  14-digit  accuracy, 
calculator.   Terminal features split screens with pages of memory;  extensive 
line-drawing  graphics; download font capability; a flat 14" screen in  amber, 
white,  or green, your choice at purchase time; plus just about  anything  one 
would  want  an ASCII terminal to do or be.  Keyboard and character  cell  are 
somewhat  improved  over the WY-50+; but in any event, you couldn't  get  much 
better  than the amber-screened 50+ we used for last couple of years.   Price: 
about  $695 with arm. Wyse Technology has been setting the pace for  value  in 
computer  terminals  and  they  don't seem to be letting  up.   We  wish  them 
continued success.
     On  the  other hand, Televideo's Model 955 is liked by an  equally  large 
group of us.  Give both the 60 and 955 (and the just released WY-99GT) a look-
see, if you are ready to buy a terminal.

Software Beat.   We report Macintosh Plus 40k-byte file copy time, detailed in 
April 1987 BYTE, page 226, as 8.1 seconds; Apple IIGS, as 44 seconds.   That's 
speed?   SemiDisk's DT42, 9.2mHz clock rate, does it in less than  8  seconds, 
floppy to floppy.
     While  into  April  issue of BYTE magazine,  you  might  enjoy  exploring 
Fairchild's  Clipper with its 5 to 33 mips throughput (Z-News  503-2,  506-4).
Article  starts  on page 161.  Stated to have a good  C  compiler,  assembler, 
debugger and simulator, and CLIX, based on Unix System V Release 3.0 operating 
system.  Would we port Z-System to such a chip set?  No, not unless our  lives 
depended on it.
     U.S/Disk,  Inc., 511-104 Encinitas Blvd., Encinitas, CA  92024,  800/992-
1992, 800/992-1993 if California, has lots of public domain software on Kaypro 
single sided disks.  Editors, games, assemblers, compilers, printer utilities, 
you  name  it.  Call for their free catalog.  Tell 'em Echelon,  the  Z-System 
folks from Los Altos sent you.
     Lotus 1-2-3 lawsuit against Mosaic and Paperback Software over  infringe-
ment  of copyright hits a snag, stalls--"look and feel" has been judged to  be 
just  text  and uncopyrightable by the Copyright  Office.   Seems  reasonable.
Should  Ford Motors be able to win a suit against other  automobile  manufact-
urers  because of clutch-brake-accelerator pedal arrangement?  Of course  not,
even though Ford was first to use present arrangement.
     Peter  Shkabara, Analytical Products, Woodland, CA, 805/688-0826,  Z-News 
702-5,  has  CP/M  versions  of  Newword, latest  release  v2.17.   He  is  an 
authorized  MicroPro dealer--$145, with The Word Plus bundled.  Such  a  deal!
Give Peter a call if interested in upgrading from WordStar v3.0 or v3.3.

What  Business?    What business are we in (Z-News 009-7 revisited)?   We  are 
forced  constantly  to  ask  ourselves  this  question.   Most  would  answer, 
"Echelon's in the computer software business, specifically in  CP/M-compatible 
software marketing."  Software is to computers what printing is to paper.  The 
printing,  the character on the page, produced by a "press," is the  informat-
ion; the paper page is the hardware.  Computer, software; page, printed  char-
acter--makes  an appropriate analogy.  But information?  Assessing  characters 
grouped, i.e., connected bytes, as data and words converts, in our brains, the 
groups  into information, a low level of knowledge, knowledge  being  somewhat 
below understanding.
     Learning!   That's  our  business--from raw data  to  being  informed  to 
knowing  something  to understanding much.  Many do not  see...   Learn  what?
Making  money, a living, forces a focus along Sufi ethereal lines to see  this 
multi-dimensional  picture.  Yes, but you still ask: learning what?   Learning 
those  things  necessary  to live deeply, contrasted  with  surface,  wine  to 
vinegar,  to  live  a life of purpose, useful to ourselves  and  others,  even 
useful  to  the  planet and Universe.  More than  computers...more  than  that 
visible from the surface...Echelon's business, your business...Gee!

In Other Words.   Presently, U.S. Dollar buys 147 Japanese Yen!  Last year  it 
was  240 (Z-News 502-2).  Where does it stop?  Command given  during  critical 
periods, "Put none but Americans on guard tonight."--George Washington,  1732-
1799,  1st  President  of  U.S.A.  Pray,  let  us  understand  meaning  behind 
reality...
     "It  is  not the critic who counts, not the man who points  out  how  the 
strong man stumbled or where the doer of deeds could have done better.
     "The  credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena: whose  face 
is  marred  by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who  errs  and 
comes  short  again  and again; who knows the  great  enthusiasms,  the  great 
devotions,  and spends himself in a worthy cause; who, at the best,  knows  in 
the  end the triumph of high achievement; and who, at the worst, if he  fails, 
at  least  fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never  be  with 
those  cold  and timid souls who know neither victory  nor  defeat."--Theodore 
Roosevelt, 1858-1919, 26th President of the U.S.
==============================================================================
Of Angels and Eagles.   "No man is an island."  Yet too many of us still  fear 
the loss of self that comes when serving others.  Actually, it's the only  way 
to  find yourself, to come to grips with what life is all about.  If fault  is 
found  with  present conditions it is with the me-first attitude  of  so  many 
business  managers  and leaders.  Self-serving seems to be  majority  symptom, 
disposition.   We welcome your thoughts along these and other lines...see  you 
down the lines...
