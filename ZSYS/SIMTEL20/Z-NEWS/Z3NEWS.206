Z  TIPS:   Many  have  asked to have AC,  archive copy  program  of  Z-System, 
automatically  erase file if already exists on destination  directory.   Well, 
Dennis Wright, author of ZRDOS, says to simply add "N" trailing parameter with 
"A" to have this feature:

                               AC C:=B:*.* /AN

automatically copies all changed files to C from B disk, without prompts.
     If troubles are experienced running a commercial application program with 
Z-System  because  of insufficient memory,  write the publisher.   Ask him  to 
please  upgrade his program to work in 48k-byte TPA (Transient  Program  Area) 
systems.   Ask that he organize the program to use available TPA,  using disk-
to-RAM  swap  buffers,  or modular overlays.   When Digital Research  (Pacific 
Grove,  CA)  produced  MP/M,  which allocated  48k-byte  TPA,  standard  8-bit 
software design practice became:   design applications requiring only 48k.  We 
think it was good idea then,  still do,  to promote efficient code writing for 
our computing machines; we use few appliances for work, learning!
     We  are doing our best to convince Jim Whorton to make full-screen editor 
VDO a ZCPR3 utility,  one that keys terminal video requirements to the  system 
environment as other Z3 utilities do.  Keep your fingers crossed.
     GOTO,  Version 1.2, has been updated (operates from a ZEX line) to assure 
multiple  commands are cancelled,  if on same line.   Update by ZCPR3 creator, 
Richard Conn,  now on Z-Nodes.   Also don't forget to get Rick's SAK,  Version 
2.1, that cancels ZEX processing with a ^C.  Here's how he describes these two 
utilities:

;	GOTO is a program designed to be run under ZEX which permits
; branching within a ZEX file.  It accepts only one argument, a label,
; defined within the ZEX file as a special comment of the form:
;	;=label anytext
; The syntax of GOTO is:
;	GOTO label
;
;	GOTO always aborts the rest of a multiple command line when it
; executes; if it did not do this, commands following the GOTO would
; be executed before the GOTO is performed (control returned to ZEX).

;	SAK (Strike Any Key) is used for the following purposes:
;		1) to wait for user interaction before continuing
;			and to allow the user to abort a Multiple
;			Command Line
;		2) to command the user's attention by ringing the
;			bell at his console
;		3) cancel ZEX command file in execution (2.1 - rlc)
;
;	The SAK command line is:
;		SAK /o...  or  SAK /o... text  or  SAK text
;	SAK is invoked with following options:
;		A     -- DO NOT Allow User to Cancel MCL
;		B     -- Ring Bell
;		Pnnnn -- Pause nnnn seconds and continue if no
;			 response by that time
;		Z     -- Allow User to Cancel ZEX

In original assemble/link M80.ZEX (or in ZAS.ZEX) file there's a line:

                  ;  Please Type $^C if Error(s) Exist  - ^?

possible by using ZEX's built-in prompt capability.   Line now can be replaced 
with a SAK statement:

                     SAK /P6Z Errors,  cancel link (^C)?

Advantage  here,  link  automatically  commences  if a ^C is  not  entered  by 
operator   within  6  seconds.    But  any  keypress  starts  link   operation 
immediately,  without  waiting for default pause limit.   Change to 20  second 
pause  and  add  repeating  bell alert if  you  aren't  attentive  to  console 
screen/keyboard  after  starting ZEX process;  /BP20Z  provides  difficult-to-
ignore prompt if assembly errors occur.

MORE  Z TIPS:  Setting up command lines for VFILER CMD and VMENU files is fun. 
Both programs have ability to point to a file,  called Pointer File (PF),  for 
further  processing.   Normally,  the name Current File is reserved for  files 
established by SETFILE or in SH.VAR,  i.e.,  system files.  (And don't confuse 
these  with  Current Disk or User.)  A neat command line  useful  for  editing 
files might be:

             ECHO Use Pointer File (Y, T, <sp>, or CR=yes)?
             IF INPUT
             VDO $pf
             ELSE
             VDO "Filename to Edit? "
             FI

which automatically prompts for file name to edit if pointer file is not to be 
used.   Responding  to  first prompt with Y (yes),  T (true),  space  bar,  or 
carriage return,  causes pointer file ($pf,  %f for VFILER CMD) to be used  by 
(passed to) editor.  Tip comes directly from Z-Node Central:  was a message to 
Z user, Wally Ottersbach, from Sysop Dave McCord.

Z-System  Going  Public:   ZRDOS is getting modified to be controlled by  a  Z 
utility  to  permit (optionally) public files to be  created  and  recognized. 
Fully  compatible  with  Andy Johnson-Laird (Control-C Software)  and  Bridger 
Mitchell  (Plu*Perfect  Systems) approach,  Z soon permits  any  directory  to 
access  a  command  file that uses overlays  in  another  directory.   Without 
individual patching, programs that use overlays like WordStar, dBASE, T/Maker, 
MultiPlan,  and The Word Plus,  would be placed in,  say,  A15:ROOT directory, 
with  text  and data files in other directories,  e.g.,  B0 to B15.   More  as 
features mature.
     But  until Z has public file capability we make do using SETDRU (and  WS-
FIX  or WSPAT-DM).   Awhile ago Michael Rubenstein wrote this  filter  program 
permitting  an  application program to find its associated overlays  in  other 
than current/default directory.   It gets the job done for WordStar,  The Word 
Plus,  Perfect Writer,  and other applications.  (We first mentioned SETDRU in 
Newsletter 008,  there and then called USER.)  SETDRU13.LBR is presently on Z-
Nodes and other remote access systems.

SB180  Song:  The Micromint SBC continues as top-of-list,  must-get item,  for 
dyed-in-wool 8-bitters.  SCSI hard-disk expansion interface, autostart aliases 
for  RAM  disk  make  it so  flexible.   File-load  and  auto-archive  aliases 
individually generated for wordprocessing,  database management,  spreadsheet, 
communications   activities  make  for  unbelievably  quick   and   convenient 
processing.   Z-System  custom  menus tie it (what you want to  do)  together. 
Order  yours now for early delivery (1st week of August) by calling  Micromint 
toll-free  800/635-3355;  phone number is good also for requesting  literature 
and complete pricing information on SB180.
     Build one (buy fully assembled and tested SBC with ready to boot software 
for $418.00;  add case with power supplies,  about $220.00;  three half-height 
floppies--both 5.25" and 8"--and one fast 8" or 5.25" hard disk,   $1000.00 or 
so;  connectors and cables,  $100.00;  and Wyse WY-350 color terminal) as your 
second computer,  and it quickly becomes your prime because of bright, shining 
performance!   WY-350 retails for $1195.00; ouch! multi-hue costs money.  Some 
may  feel it's not worth it and use WY-50 for $695.00.   Of course,  these are 
retail prices and few pay that these days.   Also,  lots of readily  available 
used  equipment (flea-market purchases) greatly reduce final costs of any such 
project.   (We noticed WY-100 terminals for $195.00 from WW  Components,  1771 
Junction Avenue, San Jose, CA 95112, 408/295-7171.)
     Micromint  plans to produce a stand-alone,  ready-to-run,  remote  access 
system  using SB180 and a modem board they presently finish designing.   Modem 
board uses new Xecom (374 Turquoise St.,  Milpitas,  CA  95035,  408/943-0313) 
MOSART  module  to handle telephone/computer interface  functions.   Z-System, 
Term3 and Z-Msg will be bundled with package.  More in next newsletter.
     We  trust Dave Thompson (Micro Cornucopia Magazine) and Art Carlson  (The 
Computer  Journal)  publish articles that assist learning to build  (and  use) 
Hitachi HD64180-based computers--the future is now!
