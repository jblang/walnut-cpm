 Notice the ZCPR3 System uses a consistent command and utility program syntax.
 Programmers writing new support utilities or application programs should know
 and please remember established syntax for Z3 commands.  Recognize uniform
 syntax is of great benefit to end users.  Conversely, Unix doesn't have
 uniformity in its command language structure, this being one of many reasons
 for its reputation, even among programmers, of user-unfriendliness.  Thus,
 let's keep our advantage as it is presently and show overall concordancy within
 our community, while sustaining a system of extreme versatility, power, and
 ease of use.  Maintain existing syntax.  Amen!

 EDITORIAL

 Our point of view:  RAM is and will remain more expensive than physically small
 Winchester hard disk drives, drives so popular with small computer users.  The 
 Winchester's price advantage, byte for byte, is tens to one over RAM.  A 10 to
 40 megabyte packaged disk unit (e.g., using Seagate, Ampex, MicroSciences, etc.
 drives) goes for less than $3,000.  RAM costs up to $600 per quarter megabyte.

 What we are leading up to is:  an 8-bit, 64K byte system using disk memory
 overlays (like WordStar does so effectively) is all we need for a really fast
 personal, desktop, portable or lap computer.  Why?  Those little Winchesters
 can load 50K of files in less than two (2) seconds!  WordStar loading with any
 size text file takes about 1 1/2 seconds.  A demonstration we recently gave:
 loaded WordStar and a 68K source listing in less than 2 seconds, then scanned
 from the top of file to bottom in 10 seconds using ^Q^C; scanned the same file,
 using ^Q^R, from bottom back to top in 11 seconds!  (See footnote.)  Who needs
 a RAM disk?  What with all the hassle of loading to volatile memory and making
 sure saves are performed, a fast Winchester appears a better way to go.  Who
 needs 16-bit machine and big RAM capacity expense?  Users of ZCPR3 don't! 

 We have the definitive operating system with all the features to do the things
 we want to do.  But a good Winchester makes the floppy appear really slow, by a
 factor of over ten to one.  That 10-to-1 is enough to make the difference in
 success of overlays (or chaining) or not.  Application programs using overlays
 can be any size required, using callable disk files.  T/Maker III uses this
 technique with its many support files resulting in a fully integrated program
 for word processing, list and database management, and a fast spreadsheet.
 Such programs are a wonder to behold when run from a Winchester using an
 Adaptec-type of controller.  (Adaptec of Milpitas, CA makes controller borads
 that appear to have the fastest hard-disk date transfer techniques.)

 Additionally, it seems because of human nature being what it is, less efficient
 (looser) code is written when more RAM is known to be available.  Eight-bit
 programs require Assembly Language for speed and code efficiency; C Language is
 simply not good enough here for high performance operations.  C programs run-
 ning on 16-bit machines are not any better than Assembler running on 8-bit
 machines.  Portability... so write application programs in structured Assembler
 (SYSLIB3, of course) for Z-80's and in C for 8086's.  The rest of the cpu's
 don't presently count for much in the commercial world.  (Sorry 68000's,
 8000's, 16000's and 6502's, but here at Echelon we're CP/M-80 folks.)

 We challenge 16-bit machines running portable software to match ZCPR3 CP/M's
 flexibility, speed, ease of use, and total environmental control, along with
 total system price.

 The ZCPR3 System consists of 70, or so, utilities controlled by the ZCPR3
 Command Processor (CP), the console module functional after complete system
 installation.  Complementing this array of support utilities are these
 recommended application programs:

                 1. WordStar for general wordprocessing
                 2. The WORD Plus for spelling check and correction
                 3. Punctuation & Style for punctuation and grammar
                 4. WordMaster for Assembly Language program development
                 5. dBASE II for relational database management
                 6. SuperCalc II for spreadsheet calculations
                 7. T/Maker III for an integrated environment of wordprocessing,
                    spreadsheet, accounting, file and data management, and full
                    online HELP documentation (editor set to WordStar commands
                    as noted in User's Guide Magazine Issue #7, Feb 1984)
                 8. MODEM7, MDM7, MEX, COMM7, or TERM III for communications

 Such programs combine with MENU and VMENU to produce a super powerful (and
 useful) turnkey computer software set.  Don't be mislead by hype ads; 8-bit
 software does the job at lowest cost and with minimum expenditure of your
 time.  Single-user, networked workstations is the efficient method of resource
 management and communications of the future.  Time-share CPU methods used by
 Unix, and the like, will not survive!  Each user with his own CPU -- that's
 the long-term future.  Let's quietly wait 'til Zilog's Z-800 is available; then
 we'll see what happens to time-share concepts and systems.  Central processing,
 as an efficient multiuser concept, is dead!  With ZCPR3, we have moved to high
 efficiency, as well as resource economy and high individual console operator
 productivity.  That's the route to winner-circles!  (End of Editorial.)

 Z3 TIPS:  Notice XDIR.COM displays files in all User Areas if the "U" trailing
 parameter is entered at the command line, e.g., XDIR *.* U  or  XDIR /U.
 Entering  XDIR //  recalls full range of options for the command.

 ALIAS can call another alias.  STARTUP.COM could call STLDR.COM, where the
 latter is a loader that doesn't change often.  So it is used in an alias where
 the rest changes often.  The nesting saves frequent retyping the constant.
 STARTUP.COM could consist of:

                       STLDR;SHOW E;VFILER;B0:

 where STLDR (for startup loading) is an alias made up of:

                LDR SYS.RCP,SYS.FCP,SYS.NDR,MYTERM.Z3T

 SHOW was entered as an Error Handler with "E" trailing the command name.
 ERROR2 could have been used instead and is another handler that's spectacular
 in performance and flexibility.  Try both, and the other error handlers too,
 before deciding which recovery program is best used in a specific activity.

 A chain of three sample menus are on the AMPRO BBS, as MENU.MNU.  These can
 be customized for your specific needs, but show some of the techniques getting
 you started.  The ability to use the current directory ($D) and user ($U) to
 return from a firm login is not shown but could be used wherever a hard B:
 drive is declared.  When you get some general interest menus working, please
 put them up on the BBS so others can see your handy work!  The community will
 certainly give you its appreciation.

 SAK (strike any key) adds the key missing link to making complex command lines
 and aliases really work.  Typing  SAK //  gives the customary reminder of what
 the command does and its syntax.  As an example, SAK placed after an assembly
 command and before the load command permits the operator to abort if errors
 occurred in assembly, if operator is present at CRT screen to notice.  But the
 load command may be auto executed, if after a preset time operator has not
 pressed a key to abort.  The alias could look like:

              ASM $1;SAK /P10 Enter ^C if Errors Occurred;LOAD $1

 If the operator hasn't struck ^C within ten seconds after the assembly has
 occurred, the program executes LOAD.  Add a B before the P and the console
 bell rings to alert.  (P has a range of 1 to 9999!)  Try it and see the ways
 to simply command-line programming.  $1 is filename to be assembled.  At 
 command line, enter ALIASNAME <filename>.  Remember, ALIAS passes parameters
 similar to ZEX and SUB plus has the ability to know the home directory with $D
 for disk and $U for user.  $* passes the entire command line tail and $0, the
 alias filename itself.  See ALIAS HELP for complete details.

 CLEANDIR (similar to public domain SAP -- so dear to our hearts -- but much
 faster acting) of Phase 2 Distribution is more than handy to have around and
 use on a regular basis.  Used often on all your disks, when the time comes to
 use UNERASE to recover an accidentally erased file, chances are near 100% for
 recovery being successful.  Remember we told you so.

 A note about VALUE:  Some realize the true-value nature of ZCPR3 and the ZCPR3
 System, others do not.  Look at it this way.  Unix is about 8 megabytes of
 software costing $40,000.00 for the source; object code goes for $750.00 for
 single-user systems.  ZCPR3 consists of about 3 megabytes of object, source,
 and online documentation on 16 disks -- the collection costs $173.00!  The
 value represented here is 300 to 1 in favor of ZCPR3 over Unix.

 AXIOM:  Sustained success depends on meeting continuing needs of you, our
 customers, and spending less than we take in; it's that simple, or that
 complicated without individual discipline.  When David goes up against Goliath,
 his sling shot must be in good repair!  "Sept d'un coup" -- seven in one blow;
 that's the number of Goliaths out there.  Waste no blows.  Our motto:  Echelon
 earns before it spends.  Adhering to sucg a motto means no financial debt; thus
 we will never be a candidate for Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Act.
 Certainly we don't need another company producing what everybody else produces,
 and we do our best to be different while being useful to you.

 Footnote:  Equipment used was AMPRO BOOKSHELF Series 122 computer, Media
 Distributing Ampex Hard Disk Add-on with Adaptec controlle, and Wyse Technology
 WY-50 CRT terminal.  We believe the Wyse terminal to be of highest value.  The
 Wyseword function key overlay strip makes using WordStar (and T/Maker) a joy.
 Feel and quality of the unit is super, as is its $695 retail price.  And it
 runs at 38,400 baud!  So does the AMPRO -- the two combine to make an
 attractive combination.
