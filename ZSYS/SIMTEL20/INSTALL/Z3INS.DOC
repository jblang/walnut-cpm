A minor improvement for the ZCPR3 install program.

How many times have you gotten a new ZCPR3 utility and had to 
create the simple, one line install file just to install it.  
I'll admit that it isn't too difficult to use PIP to give:

PIP xxx.INS=CON:
xxx.COM
^Z

But PIP is not at all forgiving if you make a typing mistake.
And you will usually erase the file after the installation is
completed.

Several of our club members have purchased the Ampro Little
Board computers as their second (or third or more) system,
and are busy building up system disks for a new machine.  Since
all the utilities wouldn't normally be needed on a small system
like the Little Board, they tend to get moved over to the
new machine one or two at a time, as a need is discovered for them.

To help with this situation, several of us got together one evening 
and came up with this small modification to Z3INS.

If the second argument to Z3INS has a file type of COM, that
program (only) will be installed without the bother of creating
an install file.

	Z3INS SYS.ENV DU3.COM

The program works as before if the file type of the second argument
is INS (or is omitted).

	Z3INS SYS.ENV PROGLIST.INS
