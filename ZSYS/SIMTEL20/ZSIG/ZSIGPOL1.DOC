                  ZSIG Software Submission Procedures


The following procedures will be used by ZSIG to govern

	(a)  submission of software by authors and
	(b) evaluation of such  submissions.

Please  keep  in mind that one of the purposes of ZSIG is  to  encourage
interactive  "cross-fertilization" between Z-System programmers on every
level of expertise and between users and program contributors.   If  the
guidelines  below  seem a bit formal compared to the  typically  chaotic
state  of  the CP/M-compatible Public Domain in general,  it is  because
ZSIG wants to avoid the bane of multiple versions with the same revision
level,  trivial upgrades,  non-upgrades resulting from a person's desire
to  spread  his or her name around in someone else's  source  code,  and
outright copyright theft.   It has happened.  It will not happen here if
humanly and legally preventable.

That said,  let's state for the record that we WANT your  participation,
we DON'T mandate that you join NAOG/ZSIG in order to be "published," and
we  think we will be able to help improve and focus the state of  Public
Domain Z-System software.  We also expect to learn from our contributors
and  have  the  means  to  spread new  and  significant  ideas  to  user
community.   The  people  behind  ZSIG are  software  and  documentation
professionals  with enormous respect for the creativity of amateurs  and
their  fellow professionals.  Let's work together to advance the already
fine state of the 8-bit software art.


                         Submission Of Software

1. Software  shall be submitted either by modem upload or by  sending  a
   diskette.   Modem uploads should be made,  if possible, to the Newton
   Centre  Z-Node  (#3) in Massachusetts at  617-965-7259.   Alternative
   submission  nodes are the Lillipute Z-Node (#15) in Chicago  at  312-
   649-1730  or  the Ladera Z-Node (#2) in Los Angeles at  213-670-9465.
   Non-NAOG/ZSIG-members  who  wish  to  upload  to  the  limited-access
   Lillipute  Z-Node  should  make a special arrangement  by  leaving  a
   private message to the sysop or by calling NAOG/ZSIG at  215-443-9031
   for  a modem appointment.   Software submitted on diskettes should be
   sent to the Software Librarian at the following address:

		Jay P. Sage
		1435 Centre Street
		Newton Centre, MA 02159

   IBM  8" standard SSSD or any 5" format that can be read by the  Ampro
   MULTIDSK  program  or by the MediaMaster program on an  IBM-PC/AT  is
   acceptable.  The 5" formats include the following and dozens more:

	Ampro (48- and 96-tpi)		Kaypro (all)
	Morrow (all)			Osborne (all)
	VT-180				Xerox (all)

2. Submissions should include source code,  an object file,  a DOC file,
   and  a ZCPR3-format help file.   In the event the author  desires  to
   treat  the source code as proprietary,  a special arrangement must be
   made  with  the ZSIG Sofware Librarian.   This practice  is  strongly
   discouraged  but will be permitted at the discretion of the  Software
   Librarian under special circumstances.  Also, should you be unable to
   include  a  ZCPR3-format help file,  we have some  members  who  have
   volunteered  to  prepare these files for programs  submitted  without
   them.

3. Authors shall provide their address and voice phone number for use by
   NAOG/ZSIG.   This  information  will  not be made public  unless  you
   indicate that you wish it to be released.

4. The  Software Librarian,  with the advice of the ZSIG  Director,  RAS
   Coordinator,  and  members of the Software Committee as it may  exist
   from  time  to  time,  will  render a  decision  within  3  weeks  of
   submission.   The  decision shall be either to accept the  submission
   for  inclusion in a ZSIG library,  to conditionally accept it,  or to
   reject  it.   A conditional acceptance shall be granted when  it  has
   been  determined  that  the program has substantial merit  but  needs
   additional  work.   A  conditional acceptance will be changed  to  an
   acceptance  only when the author provides a satisfactory response  to
   the  suggestions of the Software Librarian or the  assigned  Software
   Committee member.

5. Each submission shall bear a copyright notice of the form: "Copyright
   [current  year]  by [name of author]".   While  ZSIG  encourages  and
   promotes the distribution of free software,  it is desirable that the
   author  and  ZSIG  retain some control over modifications to  a  ZSIG
   Library  program.  Therefore,  a check-out system will  be  employed,
   wherein  any  person  suggesting a  program  improvement,  whether  a
   NAOG/ZSIG  member or not,  will be given a set period of time at  the
   discretion  of  the ZSIG Software Librarian,  who will  undertake  to
   obtain the permission of the original author to modify the program in
   question.   Updates  are subject to the same evaluation procedures as
   new submissions.


                         Evaluation Of Software

1. All  ZSIG submissions must be ZCPR3- and/or Z-System-oriented.   ZSIG
   defines such submissions as Z-System applications and tools.

2. A  Z-System application or tool is a program that "knows"  about  the
   ZCPR3  environment,  at  a minimum.   It should be  installable  with
   Z3INS.COM   or  have  equivalent  access  to  the  ZCPR3  Environment
   Descriptor  as appropriate,  and it must be able to deal  with  named
   directory and DU: forms where disk file access is required.  If it is
   screen oriented, it must derive its terminal interface from the ZCPR3
   TCAP.  Wherever possible, syntax help should be available to the user
   with the standard ZCPR3 command line help parameter "//".


3. While Intel mnemonics are acceptable,  ZSIG encourages all authors to
   submit programs in Zilog mnemonics.   Although the Software Librarian
   is  well  equipped  with development tools,  the  use  of  assembler-
   exclusive psuedo-ops is strongly discouraged.   It is simply not that
   difficult to generate a source file that will assemble with M80, ZAS,
   ZASM  or  Z80ASM  with at most MINOR revisions,  and ZSIG  wishes  to
   encourage such a "universal" coding style.


                      Short Statement Of Philosopy

ZSIG's  charter is to support the ZCPR3 and Z-System user  community  in
the  effort  to find,  catalog,  and distribute efficient  and  bug-free
Public Domain ZCPR3 tools and applications.

In  furtherance  of its charter,  ZSIG will create libraries of such  Z-
Tools and applications for distribution to the user community.
