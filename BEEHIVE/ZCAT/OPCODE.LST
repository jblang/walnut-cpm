Subject: Definitive Opcode List - (nf)
Date: Thu, 15-Mar-84 23:53:25 EST

One collection of new opcodes was one that I collected for
the Michigan Technic (at Univ. of Michigan) several years
ago (which is probably where the person from U of M copied
it from...)  "The Technic Guide to Assembler Language"
appeared in two parts and was the "best" of some 250 opcodes 
that I invented, got from friends, or found in various locations 
(from the library to East Engineering Bldg bathrooms) at the 
school.  The list that follows contains most of them, and a 
few more that people here (at Intermetrics) have added to 
the list.  Enjoy.
