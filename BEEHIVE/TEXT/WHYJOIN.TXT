             Why become a member to The BeeHive BeeBS???
             -------------------------------------------

By becoming a member to The BeeHive BeeBS you will not only increase
your access to the available facilities of this board threefold, you
will also be helping to subsidise the boards' running costs and to
provide badly needed new equipment. So you benefit in two ways!

1. What exactly am I entitled to as a member?
   ------------------------------------------

As a registered user here's what you are currently entitled to;

30 minutes of time online per day.
Download 100 kilobytes of files per day.
Access to all echomail and worldwide netmail.
Free use of the BBS.

If you become a member however, you are entitled to;

90 minutes of time online per day.
Download 500 kilobytes of files per day.
Optional download access to the Rude EP/Macpaint picture files (if > 18).
Access to all echomail and worldwide netmail.
Helping to keep the BBS running and pay for new equipment.

2. How much does it cost?
   ----------------------

Not Much. It depends on what type of membership you want. There are two
types available;

(i) Yearly Membership. Valid for 12 calendar months. Cost: $25.00/year.

(ii) LIFE Membership. Valid for the life of the BBS or the user,
     (Whichever comes first). Cost: Once-only payment of $50.00.

3. How do I join?
   --------------

Simply download the file MEMBER.TXT (available from file area 1). Print
it, fill it in, and then post it along with your cheque/money order to
P.O. BOX 496, Forestville, Sydney, N.S.W. 2087. Please make all
cheques/money orders out to Alan Sanders.

* Please note:- for those people who don't have a printer I will accept
  completed application forms on floppy disk (so long as you tell me
  what format the disk is. Ie. Microbee, Kaypro II, etc). I will also
  accept neatly handwritten completed application forms as well.

Please be patient when applying for membership, as I only check my
post office box about twice a week. I will upgrade your access as soon
as I recive your application.

     -------------------====================------------------

I hope I have convinced you to become a member of The BeeHive BeeBS and
that you will soon join the ranks of many other happy members here.
