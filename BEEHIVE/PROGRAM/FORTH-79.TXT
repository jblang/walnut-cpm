                         A PUBLICATION OF
                     THE FORTH STANDARDS TEAM

The  existence of a FORTH Standard does not in any respect preclude
anyone,  whether the individual has approved this Standard or  not,
from  implementing,   marketing,   purchasing  or  using  products,
processes,  or  procedures not conforming to the  Standard.   FORTH
Standards are subject to periodic review and users are cautioned to
obtain the latest editions.


                         0.  FOREWORD

The computer language FORTH was created by Mr.  Charles Moore as an
extensible,    multi-level   environment  containing elements of an
operating  system,  a machine monitor,  and facilities for  program
development and testing.

This  Standard  is a direct descendant of FORTH-77,  a work of  the
FORTH Users Group (Europe).

                         1.  PURPOSE

The purpose of this FORTH Standard is to allow transportability  of
standard  FORTH  programs  in  source  form  among  standard  FORTH
systems.   A  standard  program shall execute equivalently  on  all
standard FORTH systems.

                         2.  SCOPE

This  standard shall apply to any Standard FORTH program  executing
on  any  Standard  FORTH  system,   providing  sufficient  computer
resources (memory, mass storage) are available.


                         9.  GLOSSARY NOTATION

Order

     The  Glossary  definitions are listed  in  ASCII  alphabetical
     order.

Stack Notation

     The  first  line of each entry describes the execution of  the
     definition:

          i.e., before -- after

     In  this  notation,   the top of the stack is  to  the  right.
     Words may also be shown in context when appropriate.

Attributes

     Capitalized symbols indicate attributes of the defined words:

     C    The  word may only be used during compilation of a  colon
          definition.

     I    Indicates  that  the word is IMMEDIATE and  will  execute
          during compilation, unless special action is taken.

     U    A user variable.

Capitalization

     Word  names  as  used within the dictionary  are  conveniently
     written in upper case characters.   Within this Standard lower
     case  will  be  used when reference is made  to  the  run-time
     machine code, not directly accessible.

Pronunciation

     The  natural language pronunciation of word names is given  in
     double quotes (").

Stack Parameters

     Unless otherwise stated, all reference to numbers apply to 16-
     bit signed integers.   The implied range of values is shown as
     {from..to}.   The  content  of an address is shown  by  double
     curly  brackets,  particularly for the contents of  variables,
     i.e.,  BASE {{2..70}}.

addr                                                   {0..65,535}

     A value representing the address of a byte,  within the  FORTH
     standard memory space.   This addressed byte may represent the
     first byte of a larger data field in memory.

byte                                                   {0..255}

     A  value representing an 8 bit byte.   When in a larger field,
     the higher bits are zero.

char                                                   {0..127}

     A value representing a 7 bit ASCII character code.   When in a
     larger field, the higher bits are zero.

d                                  {-2,147,483,648..2,147,483,647}

     32 bit signed 'double' number.   The most significant 16-bits,
     with sign, is most accessible on the stack.

flag

     A numerical value with two logical states;   0 = false,   non-
     zero = true.

n                                                 {-32,768..32,767}

     16 bit signed integer number.

     Any other symbol refers to an arbitrary signed 16-bit  integer
     in the range {-32,768..32,767}, unless otherwise noted.

Input Text

     <name>

     An arbitrary FORTH word accepted from the input stream.   This
     notation refers to text from the input stream,  not to  values
     on  the data stack.   If the input stream is exhausted  before
     encountering <name>, an error condition exists.


                         10.  REQUIRED WORD SET


The  words  of  the  Required Word Set are  grouped  to  show  like
characteristics.  No implementation requirements should be inferred
from this grouping.

!              n addr --                     112            "store"
     Store n at addr.

#              ud1 -- ud2                    158            "sharp"
     Generate  from  an unsigned double number d1,  the next  ASCII
     character which is placed in an output string.   Result d2  is
     the  quotient after division by BASE is maintained for further
     processing.  Used between <# and #> .

#>             d -- addr n                   190    "sharp-greater"
     End pictured numeric output conversion.   Drop d,  leaving the
     text address, and character count, suitable for TYPE.

#S             ud -- 0 0                     209          "sharp-s"
     Convert  all digits of an unsigned 32-bit  number  ud,  adding
     each  to the pictured numeric output text,  until remainder is
     zero.   A  single  zero is added to the output string  if  the
     number was initially zero.  Use only between <# and #>.

'              -- addr                       I,171           "tick"
     Used in the form:
          '  <name>
     If  executing,  leave the parameter field address of the  next
     word accepted from the input stream.   If  compiling,  compile
     this  address  as a literal;  later execution will place  this
     value  on the stack.   An error condition exists if not  found
     after a search of the CONTEXT and FORTH vocabularies.   Within
     a  colon-definition  '  <name> is identical to [  '  <name>  ]
     LITERAL.

(              --                            I,122          "paren"
     Used in the form:
          ( ccc)
     Accept  and ignore comment characters from the  input  stream,
     until  the  next  right parenthesis.   As  a  word,  the  left
     parenthesis  must be followed by one blank.   It may freely be
     used while executing or compiling.   An error condition exists
     if the input stream is exhausted before the right parenthesis.

*              n1 n2 -- n3                   138            "times"
     Leave the arithmetic product of n1 times n2.

*/             n1 n2 n3 -- n4                220     "times-divide"
     Multiply  n1  by  n2,  divide the result by n3 and  leave  the
     quotient n4.   n4 is rounded toward zero.   The product of  n1
     times  n2  is maintained as an intermediate 32-bit  value  for
     greater precision than the otherwise equivalent  sequence:  n1
     n2 * n3 /

*/MOD          n1 n2 n3 -- n4 n5             192 "times-divide-mod"
     Multiply  n1  by  n2,  divide the result by n3 and  leave  the
     remainder n4 and quotient n5.   A 32-bit intermediate  product
     is used as for */ .  The remainder has the same sign as n1.

+              n1 n2 -- n3                   121             "plus"
     Leave the arithmetic sum of n1 plus n2.

+!             n addr --                     157       "plus-store"
     Add  n to the 16-bit value at the address,  by the  convention
     given for + .

+LOOP          n --                          I,C,141    "plus-loop"
     Add  the  signed  increment  n to the  loop  index  using  the
     convention for +,  and compare the total to the limit.  Return
     execution to the corresponding DO until the new index is equal
     to or greater than the limit (n>0),  or until the new index is
     less  than the limit (n<0).   Upon the exiting from the  loop,
     discard  the  loop control  parameters,  continuing  execution
     ahead.   Index and  limit are  signed  integers in  the  range
     {-32,768..32,767}.

     (Comment:  It is a historical precedent that the limit for n<0
     is irregular.   Further consideration of the characteristic is
     unlikely.)

,              n --                          143            "comma"
     Allot two bytes in the dictionary, storing n there.

-              n1 n2 -- n3                   134            "minus"
     Subtract n2 from n1 and leave the difference n3.

-TRAILING      addr n1 -- addr n2            148    "dash-trailing"
     Adjust  the character count n1 of a text string  beginning  at
     addr  to  exclude trailing blanks,  i.e.,  the  characters  at
     addr+n2 to addr+n1-1 are blanks.  An error condition exists if
     n1 is negative.

.              n --                          193              "dot"
     Display  n converted according to BASE in a free field  format
     with one trailing blank.  Display only a negative sign.

."                                           I,133      "dot-quote"
     Interpreted or used in a colon definition in the form:
          ." ccc"
     Accept the following text from the input stream, terminated by
     "  (double-quote).   If executing,  transmit this text to  the
     selected output device.   If compiling,  compile so that later
     execution  will  transmit  the  text to  the  selected  output
     device.   At least 127 characters are allowed in the text.  If
     the  input stream is exhausted before the terminating  double-
     quote, an error condition exists.

/              n1 n2 -- n3                   178           "divide"
     Divide  n1  by n2 and leave the quotient n3.   n3  is  rounded
     toward zero.

/MOD           n1 n2 -- n3 n4                198       "divide-mod"
     Divide  n1 by n2 and leave the remainder n3 and  quotient  n4.
     n3 has the same sign as n1.

0<             n -- flag                     144        "zero-less"
     True if n is less than zero (negative)

0=             n -- flag                     180      "zero-equals"
     True if n is zero.

     True if n is greater than zero.

1+             n -- n+1                      107         "one-plus"
     Increment n by one, according to the operation of + .

1-             n -- n-1                      105        "one-minus"
     Decrement n by one, according to the operation of - .

     Decrement n by two, according to the operation of - .

79-STANDARD                                  119
     Execute assuring that a FORTH-79 Standard system is available,
     otherwise an error condition exists.

     A defining word executed in the form:
          :  <name>  ...  ;
     Select  the  CONTEXT  vocabulary to be identical  to  CURRENT.
     Create  a  dictionary entry for <name>  in  CURRENT,  and  set
     compile   mode.    Words  thus  defined  are  called   'colon-
     definitions'.   The  compilation addresses of subsequent words
     from the input stream which are not immediate words are stored
     in  the  dictionary  to  be  executed  when  <name>  is  later
     executed.  IMMEDIATE words are executed as encountered.

     If a word is not found after a search of the CONTEXT and FORTH
     vocabularies,  conversion and compilation of a literal  number
     is attempted,  with regard to the current BASE;  that failing,
     an error condition exists .

;                                            I,C,196   "semi-colon"
     Terminate  a  colon  definition  and  stop  compilation.    If
     compiling  from mass storage and the input stream is exhausted
     before encountering ; an error condition exists.

     Initialize pictured numeric output.  The words:
          #  #>  #S  <#  HOLD  SIGN
     can   be used to specify the conversion of a  double-precision
     number into an ASCII character string stored in  right-to-left
     order.

     Transfer n to the return stack.   Every >R must be balanced by
     a  R> in the same control structure nesting level of a  colon-
     definition.

?              addr --                       194    "question-mark"
     Display the number at address, using the format of "." .

     Add  n  bytes  to the parameter field  of  the  most  recently
     defined word.

AND            n1 n2 -- n3                   183
     Leave the bitwise logical 'and' of n1 and n2.

BASE           -- addr                       U,115
     Leave  the address of a variable containing the current input-
     output numeric conversion base.  {{2..70}}

BEGIN                                        I,C,147
     Used in a colon-definition in the form:
          BEGIN ... flag UNTIL   or
          BEGIN ... flag WHILE ... REPEAT
     BEGIN  marks  the  start of a  word  sequence  for  repetitive
     execution.   A BEGIN-UNTIL loop will be repeated until flag is
     true.   A  BEGIN-WHILE-REPEAT loop will be repeated until flag
     is  false.   The words after UNTIL or REPEAT will be  executed
     when  either loop is finished.   flag is always dropped  after
     being tested.

BLK            -- addr                       U,132          "b-l-k"
     Leave  the address of a variable containing the number of  the
     mass storage block being interpreted as the input stream.   If
     the  content  is  zero,  the input stream is  taken  from  the
     terminal.

BLOCK          n -- addr                     191
     Leave the address of the first byte in block n.   If the block
     is not already in memory,  it is transferred from mass storage
     into whichever memory buffer has been least recently accessed.
     If  the  block occupying that buffer has  been  UPDATEd  (i.e.
     modified), it is rewritten onto mass storage before block n is
     read  into the buffer.   n is an unsigned number.   If correct
     mass storage read or write is not possible, an error condition
     exists.  Only data within the latest block referenced by BLOCK
     is valid by byte address, due to sharing of the block buffers.

BUFFER         n -- addr                     130
     Obtain the next block buffer,  assigning it to block  n.   The
     block  is  not  read  from  mass  storage.   If  the  previous
     contents  of  the  buffer has been marked as  UPDATEd,  it  is
     written to mass storage.   If correct writing to mass  storage
     is not possible,  an error condition exists.  The address left
     is the first byte within the buffer for data storage.  n is an
     unsigned number.

     Leave  on  the stack the contents of the byte  at  addr  (with
     higher bits zero, in a 16-bit field).

CMOVE          addr1 addr2 n --              153           "c-move"
     Move  n  bytes  beginning  at address  addr1  to  addr2.   The
     contents  of  addr1  is moved  first  proceeding  toward  high
     memory.  If n is zero nothing is moved.

COMPILE                                      C,146
     When  a  word containing COMPILE executes,  the  16-bit  value
     following   the  compilation  address  of  COMPILE  is  copied
     (compiled) into the dictionary.   i.e.,  COMPILE DUP will copy
     the compilation address of DUP.
          COMPILE  [ 0 , ]   will copy zero.

     Convert  to the equivalent stack number the text beginning  at
     addr1+1  with regard to BASE.   The new value  is  accumulated
     into double number d1, being left as d2.  addr2 is the address
     of the first non-convertible character.

COUNT          addr -- addr+1 n              159
     Leave  the  address  addr+1 and the character  count  of  text
     beginning  at addr.   The first byte at addr must contain  the

     field is left on the stack.

CURRENT        -- addr                       U,137
     Leave the address of a variable specifying the vocabulary into
     which new word definitions are to be entered.

          DO ... LOOP   or
          DO ... +LOOP
     Begin a loop which will terminate based on control parameters.
     The loop index begins at n2, and terminates based on the limit
     n1.   At LOOP or +LOOP, the index is modified by a positive or
     negative  value.   The range of a DO-LOOP is determined by the
     terminating word.   DO-LOOP may be nested.  Capacity for three
     levels  of  nesting  is specified as a  minimum  for  standard
     systems.

          and then   <namex>  <name>
     Marks  the  termination of the defining part of  the  defining
     word <name> and begins the defining of the run-time action for

ELSE           --                            I,C,167
     Used in a colon-definition in the form:
          IF ... ELSE ... THEN
     ELSE executes after the true part following IF.   ELSE  forces
     execution  to skip till just after THEN.   It has no effect on
     the stack.  (see IF)

     Delete  from  the dictionary <name> (which is in  the  CURRENT
     vocabulary)  and  all  words added  to  the  dictionary  after
     <name>,  regardless  of  their vocabulary.   Failure  to  find
     <name> in CURRENT or FORTH is an error condition.

FORTH                                        I,187
     The name of the primary vocabulary.  Execution makes FORTH the
     CONTEXT  vocabulary.   New  definitions become a part  of  the
     FORTH  until  a differing CURRENT vocabulary  is  established.
     User  vocabularies  conclude by 'chaining'  to  FORTH,  so  it
     should  be  considered that FORTH is 'contained'  within  each
     user's vocabulary.

          flag  IF ... ELSE ... THEN   or
          flag  IF ... THEN
     If  flag is true,  the words following IF are executed and the
     words following ELSE are skipped.   The ELSE part is optional.
     If flag is false, words between IF and ELSE, or between IF and
     THEN  (when  no  ELSE is  used),  are  skipped.   IF-ELSE-THEN
     conditionals may be nested.

     stream;  preserve  the  locators of the present  input  stream
     (from  >IN  and  BLK).   If interpretation is  not  terminated
     explicitly  it  will be terminated when the  input  stream  is
     exhausted.    Control   then  returns  to  the  input   stream
     containing  LOAD,  determined by the input stream locators >IN
     and BLK.

     Extract  the  n-th stack value to the top of  the  stack,  not
     counting  n  itself,  moving  the remaining  values  into  the
     vacated position.   An error condition results for n less than
     one.  {1..n}
          3  ROLL  =  ROT
          1  ROLL  =  null operation

VARIABLE                                     227
     A defining word executed in the form:
          VARIABLE  <name>
     to  create a dictionary entry for <name> and allot  two  bytes
     for  storage  in the parameter field.   The  application  must
     initialize  the stored value.   When <name> is later executed,
     it will place the storage address on the stack.

VOCABULARY                                   208
     A defining word executed in the form:
          VOCABULARY  <name>
     to  create (in the CURRENT vocabulary) a dictionary entry  for
     <name>,   which   specifies  a  new  ordered  list   of   word
     definitions.   Subsequent execution of <name> will make it the
     CONTEXT   vocabulary.    When   <name>  becomes  the   CURRENT
     vocabulary (see DEFINITIONS), new definitions will be  created
     in that list.

     In lieu of any further specification, new vocabularies 'chain'
     to  FORTH.   That  is,  when  a dictionary  search  through  a
     vocabulary is exhausted, FORTH will be searched.

WHILE          flag --                       I,C,149
     Used in the form:
          BEGIN ... flag WHILE ... REPEAT
     Select conditional execution based on flag.   On a true  flag,
     continue execution through to REPEAT,  which then returns back
     to just after BEGIN.   On a false flag, skip execution to just
     after REPEAT, exiting the structure.

WORD           char -- addr                  181
     Receive  characters  from the input stream until the  non-zero
     delimiting  character  is encountered or the input  stream  is
     exhausted,  ignoring leading delimiters.   The characters  are
     stored  as  a  packed string with the character count  in  the
     first  character position.   The actual delimiter  encountered
     (char  or  null)  is stored at the end of  the  text  but  not
     included  in the count.   If the input stream was exhausted as
     WORD is called,  then a zero length will result.   The address
     of the beginning of this packed string is left on the stack.

XOR            n1 n2 -- n3                   174             "x-or"
     Leave the bitwise exclusive-or of two numbers.

[                                            I,125   "left-bracket"
     End the compilation mode.   The text from the input stream  is
     subsequently executed.  See ]

[COMPILE]                                I,C,179  "bracket-compile"
     Used in a colon-definition in the form:
          [COMPILE] <name>
     Forces  compilation  of  the  following  word.    This  allows
     compilation  of  an IMMEDIATE word when it would otherwise  be
     executed.

]                                            126    "right-bracket"
     Sets the compilation mode.   The text from the input stream is
     subsequently compiled.  See [

uncontrolled word definitions.

Uncontrolled definitions are included for public reference of words
that   have   present  usage  and/or  are  candidates  for   future
standardization.

No   restrictions  are  placed  on  the  definition  or  usage   of
uncontrolled  words.   However,  use of these names for  procedures
differing from the given definitions is discouraged.

     A DO-LOOP terminating word.   The loop index is decremented by
     n  and  the loop terminated when the resultant  index  becomes
     equal to or less than the limit.  Magnitude logic is used, and
     n must be positive.
