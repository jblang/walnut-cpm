                     The INFO H/Z-100 Public Domain Library



This  collection  contains  program  and  information files for the Zenith Z-100
(Heath H-100) series computer system as provided by the INFO-HZ100 Public Domain
Library.

INFO-HZ100  is one of several major electronic mailing list interest groups that
are available worldwide over The Internet (TCP/IP based interconnected  computer
networks:  DRI,  NSFnet, MILnet, etc.)  and gatewayed into several mail networks
(BITnet, USEnet, UUCP, etc.).

INFO-HZ100  is a forum for  discussion concerning  topics related to  the Zenith
Z-100 (Heath H-100) family  of  professional  desktop  computers.   Messages are
forwarded  for  immediate  redistribution  to  the  main  list.  Distribution is
limited to one central mailbox per site.

Periodically,  useful  knowledge  and  items  generated  from the list and other
random sources are edited into a newsletter for distribution to both network and
non-network interested groups.   Any  comments,  suggestions,  help,  knowledge,
software, ideas, etc., would be greatly appreciated.

A  Public  Domain  library  of  H/Z-100 software, newsletters, and other related
items is available on The Internet by anonymous FTP from WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL.
The Public Domain Library is also available on disks by USnail for  non-Internet
users.  Public Domain software donations are gladly accepted!

These  Public  Domain  programs are designed to run under MS-DOS V2 or higher on
the Zenith Z-100.  Zenith does not support Z-DOS and most of these programs  may
be  damaging  to  run  under  Z-DOS.  If you don't have MS-DOS V2 or higher, you
better get it.  The BASIC programs are designed to run under the  Z-100  version
of  GW-BASIC  V2,  which  is greatly enhanced and uses different graphics aspect
ratios than the obsolete ZBASIC.

The  Z-100 GW-BASIC programs are saved in ASCII format for ease of conversion to
ZBASIC and other systems.  It is recommended to SAVE each  program  without  the
',A' option to save the BASIC program in the proper tokenized format.  This will
also decrease future loading time.

All  of the INFO-HZ100 Public Domain Library files except this 0HZPDLIB.DOC file
are in ZIP archive format.  The files were ZIPed using PKWARE's PKZIP  V1.1  and
may be extracted ('unZIPed') with PKWARE's PKUNZIP.

These programs have been carefully screened as "Public Domain" and may be freely
copied  but  not sold.  No warranty, expressed or implied, with respect to these
programs as to the quality, performance, or fitness  for  use  is  made.   Enjoy
them!!!
