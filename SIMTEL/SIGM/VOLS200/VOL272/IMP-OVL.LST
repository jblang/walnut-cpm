SUBJECT :  IMP overlay list

FROM	:  Irv Hoff

	IMP is the first (and currently the only) modem program that
takes advantage of the automatic 1k protocol offered by XMODEM 112 and
higher, and any KMD program (a replacement for XMODEM).  It also is one
of the few programs to use the automatic stepdown feature of the new
2400 bps modems to adjust the computer speed to match that of the an-
swering system.  (The US Robotics only steps down from 2400 to 1200,
not to 300.  The Paradyne ARK, Racal-Vadic 2400, Hayes 2400 and others
automatically stepdwon from 2400 to 1200 to 300.  IMP takes full advan-
tage of this feature.)

	At the bottom of this note is a list of the overlays that are
currently available for the IMP modem program.

	There are a number of options which the user may select to cus-
tomize IMP to suit his needs.  As with nearly any program, there may be
things you "wish you could do".  We tried to cover many of those, while
still keeping the overlays as short and simple as possible for "most of
the users".  An attempt was made to include enough features to allow
the sophisticated user enough tools to write his own routines if/where
appropriate, in the overlay.

	Read the IMP.CUS file for notes on how to select/use some of the
features offered in each IMP overlay.  (Such as changing the lead-in
character for the local commands while in the terminal mode to something
other than ESC, etc.)

	Others will be added as they are developed.  If you have a
	computer not already mentioned, you can perhaps use one of
	the above that matches your I/O (such as Dart, SIO, 8251,
	etc.) by selecting the correct ports, etc.  Otherwise you
	can try calling me at the below voice number from 10 am to
	midnight Pacific, and perhaps we can get something for you
	to use (then add it to this list for others).
