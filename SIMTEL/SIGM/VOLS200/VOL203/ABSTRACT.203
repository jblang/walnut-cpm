;	This disk contains an additional CNVRT HELP file, a variant of FYNDE
;	which will generate crossreference listings, and a library collection
;	of programs to translate Intel 8080 machine language to Intel 8086
;	assembly language. Given that 80T86.CNV (SIG/M 173.04) requires more
;	memory than available for the Intel 8080, machine language versions
;	are offered which are shorter and faster. All the programs are offered
;	in both Intel 8080 and Intel 8086 versions.
;
;	There are several auxiliary files, to unpack the library, unsqueeze
;	the squeezed programs, and verify checksums for the disk. All these
;	are regular SIG/M programs.

;	This disk was closed on September 12, 1984. It is submitted to the
;	Amateur Computer Group of New Jersey, Inc. under their condition:
;	"Permission is hereby granted to SIG/M to distribute the files
;	freely for non-commercial personal use."
