CHURCH.LBR   Library with 24 files 
This CHURCH MANAGEMENT SYSTEM was donated to CapOUG 
by Ralph Shipp. This is quite a sophisticated program
and could be used for any group or business.  You 
really need at least 160K capacity on each drive for 
this program.  All the files on this disk should be 
put on a single disk along with the DBASE.COM & OVR 
file. The disk should be SYSGENNED. The disk is then 
put on DRIVE A:.  On DRIVE B: put a cleanly formatted
disk with the file FILE/5.DBF.  Type: DBASE<cr>.  
When dBASE comes up, type: DO LOVE<cr>.  This command 
file will bring up this set of programs and menus. 
It is easy for a non-computer person to be able to 
use it in a few minutes.  The file on drive B has 
demonstration data and should be replaced by your 
actual data.  I think it is a very useful system.  
Use it as a model for other programs such as inventory
and card file databases.

GENEALGY.LBR  Library with 32 files
This GENEALOGY SYSTEM was obtained from the OUF 
(Paris France Osborne Users Group) and written by 
Sam Washburn, an American in Paris.  The DOC file is 
is rather extensive and very well written.  It is 
extremely easy for the novice to use. Put dBASE in 
drive A: put this disk in Drive B:. After you enter 
dBASE then set default to B: and type the command DO 
EXPLORE. You will now get a screen enter: R and then 
enter 1100.  You should now see the family tree of 
William the Conqueror.  
The genealogical data base program "EXPLORE" allows 
you to maintain a data base of people who are 
related to each other. You can add new people to the 
database and then link them together by indicating 
the direct relationships between the people. 
There are commands in the EXPLORE program that allow 
you to add and edit the people in your genealogy and 
their biographies.  These commands use certain of the 
dBASE II functions (edit, browse, append) so you will 
need to know the control keys that are used in these 
commands ^Y,^Q,^W, etc.  Otherwise the program is 
designed for a novice computer user.  There are four 
help-screens. 
When you first start up it is useful to page through 
the help-screens as they contain information that is 
worth knowing right away.

CHEKBOOK.LBR   Library with 22 files
This is a dBASE II CHECK MANAGEMENT SYSTEM.  It was 
revised and resubmitted by John J. Griffin 
(President of the Baltimore Osborne Users Group) and 
Steve Meginnis.  They modified and extended the 
personal finance system on an earlier CapOUG disk.   
The following is a description of the system:
          *  one keystroke command execution;
          *  additional functions:  VOID, REPORT, 
             and EXIT;
          *  check printing capabilities (user may
             have to modify to suit individual printers);
          *  user menu ('MNU') files  for easy
             individualization of the program;
          *  error trapping functions;
          *  current account balance information display;
          *  built-in upper/lower case insensitivity;
          *  quick payee and category entry for 
             frequently used payees;
          *  a database for your categories and 
             category codes.
GETTING STARTED:  With dBASE in the A drive and 
this disk in drive B, at the dBASE "." type "DO 
B:$MENU".  This causes the program to ask some 
preliminary questions and in time up comes the Main 
Menu.  From here, select "A" to practice entering a 
few checks.  I do not suggest trying the check 
printing until you have set up the program for your 
printer.  Read the DOC file, which is well written 
and has many suggestions for setting up your accounts.
(NOTE by John Weske, 11/30/84:  John Griffin tells me 
these programs run fine under dBASE II v2.3x and v2.4, 
but that they hang up in v2.41.  He says that all 
they need are a few CLEAR commands that he has not 
yet had a chance to put in.)

All three programs are set up for CP/M 80.  To use them
under CP/M 86 merely change the .CMD files to .PRG.
