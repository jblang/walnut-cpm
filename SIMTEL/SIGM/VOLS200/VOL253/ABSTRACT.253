   This package contains an experimental implementation of the IEEE 855 
(MOSI) standard interface for CP/M-80, together with a language 
interface for Pascal MT+.  MOSI stands for "Microprocessor Operating 
System Interface".  The purpose of the MOSI Standard is to define a 
set of standard "system calls" to access various operating systems in 
a uniform way.  This implementation is intended as a model for MOSI 
operating system interfaces and language interfaces, as well as a 
useful set of enhancements for CP/M in its own right.

   Many of the files in this distribution are compacted by the public 
domain SQUEEZE program.  These files are identified by a Q as the 
second character in the filename extension.  To recover the original 
source, run the USQ (UNSQUEEZE) program which is included. For 
example:

	USQ C: MOSICPM.DQC

   This will produce MOSICPM.DOC, which is the primary documentation
for this package. The drive specification, which is optional, will
route the result to a different disk which should have sufficient room.

   Some of the source files on this disk are Copyright 1985 by

modify these files for any purpose whatsoever, provided that the
