MEX and its documentation are Copyright (C) 1984 by Ronald G. Fowler.  A
license is extended to users to copy and exchange the program and documentation
with the sole restriction that such distribution must be non-commerical in
nature (this is not to imply that charges for such things as diskettes and
modest copying and mailing fees are of themselves commercial in nature). Re-
sale for profit may be done only with the express written consent of the
author, Ronald G. Fowler.

The US Copyright Act of 1978 provides for severe penalties for infringement,
including actual and punitive damages on a per-occurance basis.  The value I
attach to MEX is in circulation of my name as a consultant and contract pro-
grammer; this circulation-of-name will be used as a basis for actual damages
in any infringement suit.

Legitimate commercial interests interested in custom versions of MEX, for
distribution as a for-profit product, should contact the author for rates,
royalty information and sample contracts.
