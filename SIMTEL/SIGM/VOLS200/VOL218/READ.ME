MEX is a new modem program for CP/M and derivative operating systems.  It
is a superset of such programs as MODEM7 and MDM ... new features include:

	o Compatible with MDM7 overlays
	o PHONE command allows phone numbers to be dynamically entered
	  into and removed from the phone library ... phone numbers are
	  associated with mnemonics that may be up to 12 characters long,
	  and may optionally specify the baudrate for each site in the list.
	o KEY command supports multiple-character keystring creation and
	  deletion, for use as dedicated function keys in terminal-mode
	o LOAD and SAVE commands allow keystring definitions and phone
	  number libraries to be saved to and loaded from disk files
	o READ command supports unattended sessions, under control of a
	  disk file created with an editor (similar in concept to CP/M's
	  SUBMIT, with enhancements)
	o Greatly enhanced terminal mode
	o SENDOUT command to send strings to the modem (usually under con-
	  trol of a READ file).
	o CALL command allows multiple sites lists to be specified, and each
	  number to be repetitvely re-dialed any number of times.
	o STAT command allows the inspection and modification of a large
	  number of system variables
	o HELP command random-accesses a disk file to provide an on-line
	  documentation facility that completely explains the program
	o CLONE command allows MEX to be saved to disk, with the current
	  state intact (including any defined phone numbers and keystrings).
	o Special features to enhance MEX-to-MEX connections
	o Support for all CCP commands (rename, erase, type ...) extended
	  to include ZCPR2-style drive/user specifications
	o Patch file allows many default options to be modified
