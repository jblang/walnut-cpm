		"zdir" is a directory display program with a few additional
	features.


		The command line is

				zdir

	and the rest of the action is interactive.


		It displays the directory in four columns with the names
	sorted alphabetically by column together with length of each file.


		It provides, within the directory program the potential to

			rename a file,
		
			delete a file,

			display the directory of a disc on any connected drive,
  
			to assign to a disc a volume name.


		The volume name is that of the first directory entry and when
	a volume name is changed the directory entry is marked as a system
	file so that it is not displayed in the directory itself.

		To name a volume, create a zero length file on the disc so that
	it is the first in the directory and then use the "name" facility.

		WARNING!  Do not name a disc unless its' name is that of a file
	which is not important.  The file name will be be changed and its
	status will be changed to a "SYS" file.
