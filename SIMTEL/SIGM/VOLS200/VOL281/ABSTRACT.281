	The Snoopy calendar came from Phil Conrad who delivered it
to us at the 1986 Trenton Computer Festival.  It prints a neat little
12 month calendar.  We warn you, however, that it does not put a
message on screen while it is outputting to a .PRN file - so before
you reboot because the machine seems to be locked up - check to see
if the disks are not busy at work.
