				"zload"
	
			  (C) P.F.Ridler 1986


		"zload" is a program loader which takes an Intel hex file
	and loads it at a given address.


		The command line is:

			zload d:name [offset]

	where the optional parameter <offset> is a hexadecimal number
	which is to be added to the addresses at which the program was
	assembled.  The default value of <offset> is zero.

		Any areas of memory between the start of the program
	and its end which do not hold code will be filled with <nul>
	characters.

		Apart from this latter feature "zload" is the same
	as the CP/M "load".  Yes, I know that the book says that "load"
	uses a <nul> fill, but try it and see!
