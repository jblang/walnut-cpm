				"cmpcode"

			   (C) P.F.Ridler 1985


		This program compares two object code files and reprots
	the first 20 differences between them together with the addresses
	at which the differences occur.

		The command line is:

			cmpcode  d1:name1.ext1  d2:name2.ext2	


		The program will then read each file, compare the two, and
	if they are identical display the message

			Files are identical

		If one file is of a different length from the other then
	this fact will be reported.

		If there are differences between the files then the first
	twenty differences will be reported together with the addresses at
	which these differences occur.

		The main use of the program is to ensure that the same code
	is produced by two versions of an assembler or compiler.
