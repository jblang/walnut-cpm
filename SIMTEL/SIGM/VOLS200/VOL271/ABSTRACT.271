1. FP-MATH         
     This floating point math package uses an omnibus routine written for
the BDS C's CASM preprocessor.  In addition to arithmetic computations, 
it provides trigonometric (sin, cos, atan), logarithmic, and exponential
functions in 64-, 128-bit versions.  See DOC file in .LBR               


2. CROSSFUNC
	This program allows you to make a cross-reference of a C source
program.  It is invoked by the following command:

	A>crossfunc C-source [cr-symbol] [-L/-S]

	The program scans the specified C-source file, and extract 
functions from it, then sort in alphabetical order.  Finally, two tables,
the reference of line numbers and functions, are created.  Option -L is to
format the table for a 15-inch wide printer.  The default is -S which means
10-inch width.
	Please note that the cross-refernce symbol file has not yet been
supported in the current version (V2.12).

3. NAMECONT
	This is to display the tree structure of the status of variables 
used in a C program.
