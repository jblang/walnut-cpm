	Mark Aldon Weiss, a graduate student at Syracuse, sent SIG/M
a letter asking if we would be interested in some of his TURBO Pascal
programs.  We said we would and a minor scrape with with Postal Service
Mauling system, we got back two disks of programs, a six page letter
filled with various formulas and an assortment of data sheets.

	Much of what Mark was doing related to random number generation.
We therefore asked Paul Gans at the Chemistry Department of NYU (who 
lives and breathes random number generation) to take a look at what
Mark had done.  Paul came back with the conclusion that it was some
of the best material he had seen.  He promised to 'clean up' the
documentation (which he has not yet done), so this release includes
only the original documentation.

	All of the programs (except one in Microsoft Basic) are written
in Turbo Pascal Verson 2.0. The Turbo compiler produces Z-80 code. They
are installed for a Televideo 910 and an Expson MX-80 printer.

	Mark's address is 1011 East Adams Street Apt 53, Syracuse,
NY 13210. His phone is (315)474-2565.
