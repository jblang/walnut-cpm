INTRODUCTION

   PERCOMP.CAL is a sample template for determining chemical
percent compositions in Supercalc 2. It contains the worksheet
for a sample molecule already, but you can fill in the data
for the molecule you are looking for. All of the elements are
not listed merely for convenience, because, a template of over 100
elements is a bit impractical to solve a percent composition
problem for a molecule with only 3 or 4 elements.

   PERCOMP.CAL was created by Stephen Cebula as an exercise from
his chemistry 101 class. It serves as a useful example of how the
computer can be used by a student other than for word processing.


FORMULAS

   When you insert new elements in this template, pay close
attention to the formula used to determine the individual percent
composition for an element. It is the net mass of that element in the
molecule, divided by the total mass of the molecule, times 100 to
get a percentage. A sample formula for column E which represents the
individual percent composition would look like this for the element in
row 20:

        D20/D25*100

where D25 represents the total molar mass of the molecule and D20 is
the net mass of the element. Here, oxygen (O), has two atoms (from data in
column C) and an atomic mass of 15.994 (for each oxygen atom). Therefore,
the net mass equals 2 times 15.994 or B20*C20 in Supercalc notation. A little
reminder, when you insert or delete atoms in this list, you should also make sure
that the equations are in the same form as the original ones, Also, you must
make sure that the cell representing the total molar mass (D25 in this case) is
the sum of all net masses. It is SUM(D8:D23) in the original version.

OTHER VERSIONS

   Enjoy this Supercalc template. It serves as a example of how the computer
can be of use to non-Computer Science majors in an educational setting other
than just word processing. The same technique can be used with other spreadsheets
to solve the percent composition problem. 

   A version of this template exists for  Multiplan(tm) in CP/M(tm) and Apple
Macintosh(tm) form. If you are interested in such items, just contact me in one of
the forementioned ways.
