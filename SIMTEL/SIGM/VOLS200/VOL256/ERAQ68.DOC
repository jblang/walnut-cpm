ERAQ68  can be invoked with both ambiguous and unambiguous filenames, even
        though the latter form would be no real improvement over CCP's ERA.
        When called with an ambiguous file specification as the CCP command
        line parameter, ERAQ68 asks you to confirm the erase request for
        every filename match. You can answer either Y or N (upper or lower
        case) to erase or to skip to the next file name match respectively.
        Use ^C to return to the CCP.
