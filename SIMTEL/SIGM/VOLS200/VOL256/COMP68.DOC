COMP68 performs a byte by byte compare on any two files whose unambiguous
       filenames have been supplied as CCP command line parameters.
       Differences are displayed on the CON: device in hex and, if the hex
       value represents a printing ASCII character, also in ASCII.
       Scrolling can be stopped with ^S and continued with ^Q. ^C aborts.
