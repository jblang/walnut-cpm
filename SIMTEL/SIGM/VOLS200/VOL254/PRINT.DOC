PRINT.LBR is a substantial extension to ENCOL.LBR, contained in SIG/M
volume 206. ENCOL contained programs which would fold a file onto itself,
so that it could be listed in two (TWCOL), three (THCOL) or four (FOCOL)
columns. Many files, particularly assembly listings or tables of data,
occupy only a few lefthand columns on each page, which means that a two-,
three-, or four-fold saving of paper would result from a multiple column
listing. Additionally, more compact listings are easier to consult for
reference or cross checking.

ENCOL also contained a program for listing on both sides of the paper,
resulting is a further saving in paper, and convenience for consulting
bound listings. Basically it counted out the number of lines per page as
it sent them to the printer, withholding the even-numbered pages for a
second run after the paper had been turned over.

All of these programs were presented in two versions, one for the Intel
8080 and one for the Intel 8086, using the corresponding CP/M operating
systems. PRINT also contains two versions, one for each of these CPU's.

PRINT introduces a new type of listing, in which multiple files may be
listed side by side for purposes of comparison. Two (TWFIL), three (THFIL),
or four (FOFIL) files may be shown as parallel strips on the same sheet
of paper.

Experience has shown that assembly listings can be doubled up, and still
retain a significant portion of their comments, if the compressed mode
of 16.5 characters per inch which is available on many printers is used.
This is particularly convenient when the listings are prepared for archival
purposes. If the comments can be sacrificed, Intel 8086 assembly listings
can be reproduced in three columns, while Intel 8080 assembly listings
are still intelligible in the four column format.

Further space saving is possible - 25% more - if the listings are prepared
at eight lines per inch rather than the customary six lines per inch. For
the programs TWFIL, THFIL, or FOFIL this does not matter, but TWCOL, THCOL,
and FOCOL must take account of the number of lines which will be printed
on each page in order to do their folding correctly. Consequently a switch
has been incorporated in this new version of these programs to choose
between the two different line densities.

Finally, the page printing program, formerly PRINTDO, has been thoroughly
reorganized. It, too, admits a switch to choose between six or eight lines
per inch, so that either format can be handled by the same program. It is
now called simply PRINT, and through another switch setting can be made to
handle either single sided printing or double sided printing. Many times
a two-sided printing was ruined when an interruption occurred when the job
was half done, so another switch has been included which allows printing
only front sides, or only back sides.

With the advent of squeezed programs and libraries of programs whose
members might plausibly also be squeezed, there is a tendency to endow
programs with the capability to work directly with these alternative
formats. In common with some other contributions to SIG/M, we have used
parentheses to indicate indirect references, and as a sort of "area code"
when referring to libraries. Thus, if a somewhat intricate print job is
contemplated, a Command Line File (extension CLF) may be built up, and
then executed by indirect reference.

Let us suppose that some assembly listings are present, both squeezed
and unsqueezed, with some of them in a library X.LBR, and some of them
regular files on the disk. Suppose also that the file Y.CLF contains
the following two lines:

	A.ASM,B.ASM,C.ASM
	((X) G.AQM),((X) H.AQM)

Then, the following lines give some examples of the use of PRINT:

	PRINT A.ASM			- A.ASM at 6 lines, 2 sides
	PRINT A.AQM			- supposing A was squeezed
	PRINT [8] *.ASM			- all ASM files at 8 lines, 2 sides
	PRINT [8S] A.ASM,B.ASM		- A.ASM and B.ASM, 8 lines, 1 side
	PRINT [B] ((X) *.AQM)		- backsides of all squeezed ASM's
					  in the library X.LBR, 8 lines/inch
	PRINT [B] ((B:X) *.AQM)		- but library is on disk B
	PRINT [8] (Y)			- assemblies A,B,C, and squeezed
					  A and B in X.LBR   [see Y.CLF]
	PRINT (X),D.ASM			- as above, plus D.ASM, at 6 lines
	PRINT (B:Y)			- command line file is on disk B
	PRINT B:*.*			- everthing <except> .COM, .CMD,
					  or .LBR on disk B at 6 lines/inch
					  [hopefully no other binary files]
	PRINT				- print a tutorial message

Further information about the programs comprising PRINT.LBR can be found
in the assembly programs comprising the individual members. Generally
speaking, each program will present sufficient information for its use
by giving it a null command line. This feature is particularly useful if
one is not just sure about the form of the correct command line, or if one
has forgotten the switches.

To prepare the lines that follow, this much of PRINT.DOC has been subjected
to each of the six programs TWCOL, THCOL, FOCOL, TWFIL, THFIL, FOFIL. Of
course, the last three programs would normally be used on distinct files
and not on the same repeated file. In each case a few lines of the composite
file is shown to illustrate the corresponding program.

PRINT.COM and PRINT.CMD <are> specialized for ports 0FAH and 0FBH, of the
Godbout System Support, or equivalent ports on an Interfacer card. The
port assignments are assembly parameters - <data> and <status>. The
subroutine <lpw> in each program can be replaced by a BDOS call in a system
for which a satisfactory printer BIOS is installed.
