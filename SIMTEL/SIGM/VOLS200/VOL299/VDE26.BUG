Re:   VDE26

   I just downloaded VDE26.LBR a little while ago, and I'm trying to 
use it.  Seems okay, but it has three rather annoying bugs:

   1)  The "Un-delete" function doesn't know when to quit.  Try un- 
deleting without deleting something first, and it "recalls" any random 
garbage sitting in memory.  Same thing happens if you try to recall 
past the first deleted character.

   2)  When reformatting, VDE sometimes loses the last characters on a 
line.  They just dissappear, and have to be re-entered.

   3)  No matter how it's installed, VDE will NOT start up in INSert 
mode -- at least not on my Kaypro 1.

   Apart from these bugs, I like the program.  I'm curious though 
about something I noticed in the install program -- apparently VDM 
(memory-mapped version) is installable on older Kaypro II/IV models. 
Why not on newer 2/4/10s?  VDE is fast now, but a memory mapped 
version would really fly.
