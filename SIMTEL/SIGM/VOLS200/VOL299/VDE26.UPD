     Added fourth printer toggle
     Case insensitive search option
     Blank filename, 0K files now allowed
     Improved header has flags for double spacing, margin release
     Hard CR action & margins removed from "N" mode
     Control codes no longer throw off text formatting
     ^B no longer gives annoying error message at EOF

VDE only:
     Installs for ANY terminal, even without cursor addressing
     More free RAM (several K) for editing
