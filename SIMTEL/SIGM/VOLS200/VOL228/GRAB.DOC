	GRAB is a program to find and grab paragraphs from a WordStar
	file and is a slight modification of FFYNDE which is a program by
	Harold McIntosh that searchs a family of files for many different
	keyword expressions that are taken from an input file. See the 
	source code files for author credits and more information.

	GRAB ability to process whole paragraphs depends upon how the lines
	in WordStar are ended with a "soft" carrage return, (08D hex). If
	the file has "hard" carrage returns, (0D hex) then GRAB will work
	same as FFYNDE and just find lines rather than whole paragraphs.

	If GRAB finds a keyword in a paragraph, it will first list the line
	number on which the match was made and then the whole paragraph,
	both to the console and to a results file. All of WordStar's high
	bits are stripped both for the matching of keywords and for output
	to the console and the results file.
