    the cursol reaches the left edge of the screen, it stops.
^D :character right
    Moves the cursor one character to the right non-destructively, i.e.
    without affecting the character there.  This command does not work
    across line breaks, i.e. when the cursol reaches the right edge of
    the screen, it stops.
^A :word left

    is defined as a sequence of alphabets and numbers.  This command
    works across line breaks.

-- insert and delete commands --

^V :insert mode on/off
    When you enter text, you may choose between two entry modes:
    Insert and Overwrite.  Insert mode is the default value
    when the editor is invoked, and it lets you insert new text
    into an existing text.  The existing text to the right of
    the cursor simply moves to the right while you enter the new
    text.
      Overwrite mode may be chosen if you wish to replace old
    text with new text.  Chracters entered then replace existing
    characters under the cursor.
      You switch between these modes with the insert mode on/off
    commands ^V, and the current mode is displayed in the command
    line at the top of the screen.
<RUBOUT>:delete left character
    Moves one character to the left and deletes the character there.
    Any characters to the right of the cursor move one position
    to the left.  This command does not work across line breaks,
    i.e. when the cursor reaches the left edge of the screen,
    it stops.
^G :delete character under cursor
    Deletes the character under the cursor and moves any characters
    to the right of the cursor one position to the left.  This
    command does not work across line breaks.
^T :delete right word
    Deletes the word to the right of the cursor.  A word is defined
    as a sequence of alphabets and number. This command works
    across line breaks, i.e. it may be used to remove line breaks.
^B :insert empty line above
    Insert an empty line above the cursor.
^N :insert line
    Insert a line break at the cursor position.  The cursor dose not
    move.

    Delete the line containing the cursor and moves any lines below
    one line up.
^Q^Y :delete to the end of line
    Deletes all text from the cursor position to the end of the line.
