Changes for RBBS 3.1:

1.  User now receives the message ">>>ACCESS DENIED<<<" if he attempts
to enter CP/M and there is an asterisk next to his entry in USERS.

2.  The Kill Command reprompts for another message to kill in the same
fashion as the Read command.

3.  A ^K during a forward sequential Read just skips the rest of the
current message being displayed and goes on to the next one.

                  RBBS 3.0 Preliminary Documentation

RBBS Version 3.0 is based on RBBS 2.4 and incorporates several mods
from RBBS-RTN.001.  However, it goes far beyond those mods to fix many
longstanding bugs as well as add many new features.

The major new feature is a working user password scheme which
minimally impacts present systems running older versions of RBBS.

The first version of this program has been in use for about a month on
three RCP/M systems in the El Paso, TX area and has received a
thorough debugging which led directly to this first public release.

To run this version, you will also need MENURBBS and NEWCOM text
files, as well as making up your own versions of PWDS, BULLETIN, INFO,
and ENTERCPM text files.  Only MENURBBS and ENTERCPM are new, and
ENTERCPM may be extracted from your existing RBBS source file to use.

Users running older versions of RBBS will have to edit their USERS
file to replace the blanks between fields with semicolons and add a
new field for the initial default password as follows:

JOE USER;ANYCITY, USA;DEFAULT

Be sure to us overwrite rather than insert mode to make these changes.

The only major drawback to bringing this program up in .COM file
format is that you will not only need BASCOM and L80, but also a TPA
of at least 54K to run L80.  Alternately, if you have access to
PLINKII, you will not have a problem with linking this program.

You will also have to make some trivial mods to the source to
customize it for you local implementation:

1.  Change VERS1$ in line 190 to be your own system name.

2.  Change SYS1$ and SYS2$ in line 200 to your (the SYSOP's) first and
last name, respectively.

3.  Change DSK$ in line 220 to the drive containing all the files read
or used by RBBS.

4.  Remove the REM in lines 890 and 7140 if you want RBBS to store the
first four characters of the caller's last name beginning at 40H.
This information may then be used by other programs, such as special
versions of XMODEM, to log the caller's name in some file.

5.  Change the value for the OUT statement in line 4290.  It is
presently set up to output a zero in port 82H for a DCHayes modem
addressed at 80H.

6.  Change your PWDS file to add two new fields, ending up looking
like the following format:

field1,field2,field3,field4

where:

field1 is the "first name" for direct entry to CP/M

field2 is the "last name" used for the SYSOP login

field3 is the "password" or answer to the prompt in field4 (or NOPASS,
in which case no password is required of the user)

field4 is the prompt string that the user must answer to match field3.

Enjoy!
