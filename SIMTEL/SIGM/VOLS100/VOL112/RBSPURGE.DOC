      RBSPURGE is a bastardized version of Ron Fowler's RBSUTL22.BAS.
Since I use the PURGE feature 90% of the time, and do it in a SUBMIT
file, I took out all of the extraneous code, and 'hardwired' the
options to purge with no renumber capability.  I have released the
new program as PURGE.BAS.  On my system, the BBS program and utility
files are on a floppy in the A: drive.  When purging, I move that
disk to B: and insert a special disk in A.  That disk has the compiled
version of RBSPURGE renamed to PURGE.COM.  I have included the submit
file I use as an example.  Needles to say, this won't work the same if
you are using it under the MBASIC interpreter. Feel free to change it
to suit your needs.  The command syntax used here is:

                     A>SUBMIT PURGE {today's date}

in other words:

                     A>SUBMIT PURGE 3/28/82

      Since I use SD.COM to monitor the progress, (when I'm not away
at the fridge) and XSUB hates SD (or vice versa), I did not use XSUB
for the multiple PIPs. The reminders to 'SAVE' the 0K files on the B
drive are optional.  If you leave the CALLERS, COMMENTS, AND SURVEY
files out in the open, or you have them up on high non-public user
areas,  just delete that garbage.

      I pass this on to whomever wants it, it saves me from some VERY
boring chores.
