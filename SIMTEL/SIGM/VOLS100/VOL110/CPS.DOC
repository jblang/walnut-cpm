The dBASE command file, CPS.CMD is designed to set the dBASE date to the 
current date stored in a Mountain Hardware CPS card.  This routine 
assumes the standard CPS clock driver has been loaded at address F300H
as documented in the CPS CP/M manual.   Comments in the command
file describe the functioning of the command.  The only tricky part
deals with the fact that dBASE uses a different format for strings
than the CPS driver (which was written to handle MBASIC strings).
The conversion is done by a small machine-language routine which
is POKEd into memory.
