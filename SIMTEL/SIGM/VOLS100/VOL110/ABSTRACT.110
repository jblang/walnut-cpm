	The Club has received a number of requests for dBASEII and
Super Calc programs. On this volume we present what we have thus far
obtained and urge the rest of you to submit your application programs
for distrubution.

	The sample data base was adopted from one I am making extensive
use of in the office on Displaywriters. Three indexes have been included
for demo purposes, but the program does run slow when a lot of data has
been added. The field size should be cut from the demo to suit your needs.
Note how we go in and out of indexing to speed things up.

	This program is ready to run (note, there is room on this disk 
for the .MEM files it will create. However, do not try to transfer .MEM
files between CP/M80 and CP/M86 machines.

	The rest of the dBASE programs came from a dBASE bulletin board 
run by Computer Systems Design of 454 Kenneth Ave., Campbell, CA 95008.
Their board phone is (408)378-8733. 

	Harry Van Tassel provided the Super Calc programs. His regular
Super Calc programs are highly user specific, but these two (one of which 
he wrote, one of which is source attributed) should be of general interest.
Harry also did the finishing touches on some of the problems in the sample
data base, and we are most appreciate of that.

	We had some room on the disk and therefore also added updated
versions of SAP (sort and pack) and SWEEP.
