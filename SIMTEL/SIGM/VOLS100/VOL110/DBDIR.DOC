	The DBDIR routines demonstrate how to call an
assembler subroutine from dBASEII.  There are a number of
restrictions!  Briefly, you can load an assembler routine
above location A400 hex, as long as you don't do any sorts!
You have available to you the memory space from A400 hex to
the top of your TPA (on mine it is E400 hex, on a 64K
system).

	The following files are required:
		- dbdir.cmd
		- asciidec.cmd
		- dbdir.asm

	The .asm file is Z80 code which was assembled using
M80/L80, and does a not very efficient method of getting the
directory entries, but it works.

	Hope this helps explain a not too well documented
command in dBASE.  Any comments concerning these routines
can be left on this BBS, and if you make any wonderous
enhancements, and would like to share them, please leave them
on this BBS also.
