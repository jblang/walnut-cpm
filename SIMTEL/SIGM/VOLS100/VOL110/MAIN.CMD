* main command program of database
* this is a dBASEII database we use in a number of applications
* it has been adopted to a sample ACGNJ database, and you can
* modify it further to suit your particular application. note that
* the link files has not yet been included in the menu structure.
* also note that we have not implemented all of the features
* we contemplate, so that some program features are not yet
* available. lastly, the starting point on this program was
* Adam Green 's "dBASE II User' s guide " published by Software
* Bank, 1 Faneuil Hall Marketplace, Boston, MA 02109. We highly 
* recommend that book as the best thing around to get started in
* dBASEii and suggest you may even want to start off with
* a Software Bank seminar.
*
*
* this program runs well under both cp/m and cp/m 86. to run
* under cp/m 86 just change the name of this files to main.prg.
* 
* one known bug, if you edit on the duprec format you
* will not see the changes until second viewing. We
* think it relates to too many memory variables.

* comments, suggestions and improvements are welcome.
*
