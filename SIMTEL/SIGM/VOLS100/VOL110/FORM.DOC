The dBASE FORM command will print the field name, type, width
and dec information about a dBASE file.  This neatly printed
matrix may be used for documentation purposes.

The command uses the expanded print feature of the Okidata
printer.  Two documented lines in the command file should
be modified for your printer's expanded print feature
or removed if your printer doesn't have the expanded print
feature.
