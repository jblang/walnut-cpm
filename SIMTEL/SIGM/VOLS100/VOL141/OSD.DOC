OSD-41.DOC  Documentation for OSD-41.COM.

	    OSD-41 is the SD-41 Sorted Directory
	    program implemented to fit 3-up on
	    the Osborne-1 52 character-wide screen.
	    This is a better directory program than
	    the XDIR supplied with your system.

	    See SD-41.DOC for complete details
	    about all the command options.

	    Program originally by Keith Petersen.
	    Modified by Ted Shapin.

	    This version by Tom McCormick 6/11/82
	    was done by:
		1. Removing the "|" fence character.
		2. Removing the period between the
		   filename and filetype.
		3. Removing the user number heading
		   at the left side of each line.
	    These changes allowed a 3-up listing
	    to just barely fit on the Osborne-1 CRT.

	    One final note: if your OS-1 screen width
	    is 52, the listing is double-spaced. If it
	    is wider, (ie. 128), then it is
	    single-spaced.

	    OS-1 owners should also consider placing
	    WASH on their disks in place of PIP.  It
	    uses only 4k compared to PIP's 8k. While
	    you still need PIP to verify or
	    concatenate, WASH is easier to use.
