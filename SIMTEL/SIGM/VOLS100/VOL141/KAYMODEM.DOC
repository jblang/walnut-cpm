A QUICK NOTE ABOUT KAYMODEM

     THIS IS A KLUDGY, BUT ADEQUATE ADOPTATION OF SMODEM37 FOR
THE KAYPRO, IT CORRECTLY INITIALIZES THE SIO, AND ASKS YOU TO
SET THE BAUD RATE BEFORE ENTERING SMODEM.

     WOULD HAVE DONE A CLEANER JOB, BUT WE LOST THE SOURCE
FOR SMODEM IN A MAJOR DISASTER (DO NOT SET AN OLD-STYLE BELL
TELEPHONE SET ON YOUR FILE OF 200 MASTER DISKETTES!!!!!!!)

     HOPE THAT THIS WILL BE OF SOME USE TO SOMEBODY.

     QUESTIONS???
