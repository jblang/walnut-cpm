RELOC FILES ON THIS DISK
========================

The files on this diskette comprise a complete system for the generation
of self-relocating programs, i.e. programs which move themselves up to
the top of the TPA.  Source and object code is provided along with
documentation and some sample programs.

RELOC.DQC	A writeup on the general principles of constructing self-
		relocating programs, a description of one of the standard
		methods and a description of the H-B method. (Squeezed)      

RELOC.REL	Relocator module which moves the useful bit of a program
		up to the top of the TPA.

RELOC.MQC	Z80 assembly-language source of the above. (Squeezed)

RELOC.OBJ	SRP generator program.  Matches two .COM files and tacks
		a relocation bitmap onto one of them. Rename to COM file 
                before using.

RELOC.CQ	BDS-C source code of the SRP generator. (Squeezed)

RELOC.SUB	A SUBMIT file to automate the whole process.

TEST1.MQC	A program to test the RELOC system. (Squeezed)

SRP1.OBJ	Self-relocating version of the above produced by renaming
		the output of SUBMIT RELOC TEST1. Rename to COM file

TEST2.MQC       Another test program in the various forms corresponding to
SRP2.OBJ        those for TEST1 above.

TEST.SUB	A submit file to run the tests.  Just say

			SUBMIT TEST 1

		and lots of things will happen.  Similarly for test 2.
