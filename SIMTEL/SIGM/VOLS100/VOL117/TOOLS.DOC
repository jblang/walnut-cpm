Herewith source and .REL files for a tool package similar to
(but considerably less exhaustive than) Richard Conn's Syslib.
This one supports command-line redirection and implicit (via
STDIN and STDOUT) or explicit I/O to any one of 16 channels.
There are routines to make use of the AMD 9511 chip, and
anyone who hasn't got one will need to (a) avoid the double-
integer and floating-point routines, and (b) rewrite one
routine, ITOC, to do its conversion in software.  This will
be easy if Digital Research's 'Lib' manager is available.
Three files (other than this one) are provided on this disk:
	Tools.Arc is a text file containing M80 source for
		all of the tools described in ToolIntf.Doc,
		plus a set of archive-maintenance macros for
		use with Pmate 3.x.
	ToolIntf.Doc is a text file containing "black-box"
		descriptions of the routines and their
		functions - very terse!
	Tools.Rel is a Microsoft-format .Rel file containing
		all of the tools, assembled with LYNX set
		TRUE so that the address of the first free
		byte after the .COM file is expected at 108h.
		If you don't have Lynx you can (a) reassemble
		all modules that INCLUDE LINKEQU with LYNX set
		FALSE, or (b) kludge in a patch into each of
		your .COM files so you can enter the address
		manually with DDT, or (c) get Lynx - Westico
		sells it and it's a very nice linking loader
		that supports overlays and makes human-
		readable dumps of .REL files, in addition to
		many other useful features.
Please DON'T phone me for help with this stuff unless your name
is Jud Newell - anyone else please leave a message on Jud's
System One and I will someday get back to you.  I am swamped
with work at present.  Good Luck -- Greg Louis.
