          Conversational  mode  with  optional  capture  to  file  and
          multiple page review of past output.  File capture  of  long
          files  works  with  any system which responds to XOFF within
          400 characters.  
          
          Flexible uploading of suitable files to many types of remote 
          systems,  even  Bulletin  Boards  without  normal  uploading
          capability.  
          
          Error  checking  file  exchange  with  programs  using  Ward
          Christensen's  protocol  with  optional  Cyclic   Redundancy
          Check.  Enhanced error recovery and transfer abort logic.  
          
          Batch transmission of files with compatible programs.  
          
          High   speed   operation;   9600   baud  file  transfer  and
          conversational terminal   operation.      Buffered   printer
          operation at >>1200 baud.  Full printer buffering allows use 
          of  slow  printers,  or  printers with burst transfers (line
          printer, MX80, etc.).  Function key escape sequences can  be
          buffered,  wllowing  proper operation when keyboard baudrate
          exceeds host baud rate.  
          
          Disk utility functions including directory  listing,  change
          disk  and/or  user  number,  erase  files,  disk  free space
          calculation,  file  transfer  time  calculation,  CRCK  file
          check, and local listing of files.  
          
          
          Great flexibility  in specifying filenames.  New data may be
          appended to existing  ASCII  files.    Optionally,  YAM  can
          maintain  log  of  files  sent  and/or  received  with disk,
          filename, baud rate, and the name of the remote system.  
          
          Able to send files to TWX type machines.  
          
          Matching program (XYAM) for use by remote systems as  XMODEM
          replacement  obtained  from  same source files, allows batch
          transfer of files with full CRC checking.  Matching programs 
          (sb.c and rb.c) are available for Version 7 and  System  III
          Unix(tm).

          autodial operation  may  vary  with  the implementation.  If
          autodial  is  not  supported,  the   telephone   number   is
          displayed.   It  is not necessary to type the entire name as
          it appears in the file, as YAM will  find  the  first  entry

          Chat keyboard to  keyboard.    Characters  typed  by  either
          keyboard  are  echoed  to  both  ends,  and  RETURNS echo as
          RETURN/LINEFEED.  Chat will become hostile if the other  end

          3 10 chek  pattern                 3.10 chek [pattern ...] 
          Print  the  "chek"  chesksum  and  character  count  for the
          specified files.  The checksum is calculated with  the  same
          alogrithim as  the  CP/M  CHEK.COM program.  This command is
          slower but possibly more accurate than the crck command.  
          

          3 11 crck  pattern                 3.11 crck [pattern ...] 
          Print the "crck" chesksum and sector count for the specified 
          files.  The "crck" algorithm  is  stolen  from  version  4.3
          CRCK.ASM.  
          

          3 12 dir  pattern                 3.12 dir [pattern ...] 
          Display  pathnames  matching pattern alphabetized across the
          page.  The usual ambiguous filenames are allowed.  Since dir 
          or any  other  commands  which  accept  a  pattern  use  the
          circular buffer for filename expansion, be sure to write out 
          any captured  data  first!    Example:  "dir" "dir *.c" "dir
          yam*.c" "dir *.c *.h" 
          

          3 13 dirr  pattern                 3.13 dirr [pattern ...] 
          Displays the directory with the number of  sectors  in  each
          file.  The number of files matched, number of blocks, number 
          of  kb  allocated to those files, and estimated transmission
          time at the  current  baudrate  for  all  files  listed  are
          displayed.   Transmission  time  estimate  is based on batch
          transmission from a  Z89  with  700kb  Tandon  drives  to  a
          Cromemco 4mHz  4fdc  system  with  Persci  277  drive.  Time
          includes file i/o but not error correction.

          Erase the named files.  For each matched pathname, the  user
          is prompted  for  Y, N, or Q.  Y erases the file, N skips to
          the next file, and Q or anything else  aborts  the  command.

          the  modem  sends a DELETE or ETX (0177 or 003) to the host,
          the buffler is cleared.   If  a  break  from  the  modem  is
          detected,  the  buffer is cleared and a break is sent to the
          local host.  Keyboard characters from the local terminal are 
          sent to the local host.  Operation assumes  that  the  modem
          port  is the slower of the two, and that the local host will
          not overflow the circular buffer before giving the remote  a
          chance to  respond.   This last requirement means that files
          longer  than  the  size  of  the  circular  buffer  must  be
          displayed with a pager such as more(1).  Exit from this term 
          - like function is with control E from the local keyboard.  
          

          3 24 list pattern                  3.24 list pattern [...] 
          List the file(s) specified by one or more possibly ambiguous 
          pattern(s).  This command closes any open send file.  Yam or 
          Xyam  compiled  with  USQ  defined will automatically detect
          squeezed files and print them in ASCII.  List  stops/resumes
          printing with  ^S.   Keyboarding ^X cancels, and ^K skips to
          the next file (it might take a few whacks of the keyboard to 
          get YAM to hear it.) XYAM prefaces each  file  with  ^R  and
          suffixes it  with  ^T.    The standard putchar() is used, so
          tabs and newlines are expanded.  The printer can be  enabled
          with ^P  on  the  command  line.  Because tabs are expanded,
          files containing tabs will get larger if downloaded with the 
          list command; if you can't use the s command, at  least  use
          type.   Likewise,  because  newlines  are expanded to cr/lf,
          there will usually be two carriage returns per line.  
          

          3 25 mn            3.25 mn 
          Change data port to (decimal) n.  Example: "m224" The domain 
          of  correct  port  numbers  and  consequences  arising  from
          incorrect port numbers vary with the implementation.

          3 29 reset  size             3.29 reset [size] 
          Dump the capture buffer; if a file is open, close all files, 
          and reset   CP/M's   disk  system.    This  allows  swapping
          diskettes.  The optional argument size becomes the  size  of
          the circular capture buffer, useful for debugging.

          3 30 replot  m             3.30 replot [m] 
          Redisplay  the last m lines and/or escape sequences received
          from the host.  If m is 0 or absent, redisplay starting with 
          the earliest data.  A screenful is displayed at a time.  The 
          commands accepted in replot mode are listed below.  
          

          3 31 rewind            3.31 rewind 
          Rewind the buffer pointers for  the  display,  printer,  and
          file dump  from  the  term  function.    The  effect of this
          command is the same as if the data  had  been  sent  another
          time.  
          

          3 32 r options   file                 3.32 r[options] [file ...] 
          Receive  with  options  1  or  more  files  using  the  Ward
          Christensen protocol.  If no filename is given,  batch  mode
          is assumed.    (Note:  batch  mode  is  not  compatible with
          MODEM7.) If more than one filename is given, a  single  file
          transfer will be made for each.  If the RESTRICTED option is 
          defined,   a   file  received  in  error  will  be  unlinked
          (erased).

          3 34 sum pattern                 3.34 sum pattern ...  
          Sums the named source files  with  an  alogritim  compatible
          with  sum(1)  on  Version  7  Unix  (sum  -r on System III).
          Carriage returns, and all characters  starting  with  CPMEOF
          are excluded  from  the calculation.  This processing allows
          comparision of source files stored on different systems  but
          not ``binary'' files.  
          

          3 35 s options  pattern                 3.35 s[options] pattern ...  
          If  batch  mode  is  specified  with the b option, 0 or more
          files are sent according to the ambiguous pathname(s).    If
          batch  mode  is not specified, the named unambiguous file(s)
          are sent each in single file mode.  
          

          3 36 type pattern                  3.36 type pattern [...] 
          Type the file(s) specified by one or more possibly ambiguous 
          pattern(s).  This command closes any open send file.  Yam or 
          Xyam compiled with USQ  defined  will  automatically  detect
          squeezed files  and print them in ASCII.  Type stops/resumes
          printing with ^S.  Keyboarding ^X cancels, and ^K  skips  to
          the next file.  XYAM prefaces each file with ^R and suffixes 
          it with ^T.  Direct console output (bios(4, ...) is used.  
          

          3 37 t c  mode   file             3.37 t[c][mode] [file] 
          The term  function with optional capture to file.  0 or more
          modes may be enabled.  The c (close) mode causes data in the 
          capture  buffer  to  be   written   to   file   and   closed

          immediately.   View mode causes the term function to display
          control characters  by  prefixing  ^  to  the  corresponding
          letter.   If the free buffer space becomes low, yam attempts
          an xoff-dump-xon sequence.  A receive file previously opened 
          by 't file' will not be closed by a 't'command.  
          
          In XYAM, t file begins data capture, and received characters 
          are not echoed.  If the remote sends Control-Z, the file  is
          closed.  
          
          Keyboarded  characters  are  treated  in  either of two ways
          depending on the value of Exitchar (see parameters,  below).
          If  Exitchar  is non zero, term will return when a character
          matching Exitchar is keyboarded, and all others  are  passed
          without any   special  action.    Otherwise,  the  following
          subcommands are available: 

          _ __ _               3.37.1 ^@ 
          Break. Sends a break signal to the remote.  The break key on 
          your terminal will probably generate a ^@ (NULL)  character.
          After  the  break  is  sent,  any  remaining  keyboard input
          (usually garbage from a break character) is discarded.  
          

          _ __ _  _            3.37.2 ^E 
          Exits from the term function back  to  main  command  level.
          Rapidly  typing  ^E^E  will  instead  cause  one  ^E  to  be
          transmitted.  
          

          _ __ _  _            3.37.3 ^F 
          Iff Q (TWX) mode is in effect, transmit  ANSWERBACK  to  the
          remote.    This  is  equivalent  to  HEREIS  on  a  Teletype
          machine.  
          

          _ __ _  _            3.37.4 ^Q 
          Iff a send file  is  open  and  its  transmission  has  been
          stopped by  a  XOFF,  transmission is resumed.  Otherwise no
          special treatment.  
          

          _ __ _  _            3.37.5 ^S 
          Iff a send  file  is  open  and  it  is  being  transmitted,
          transmission is stopped.  Otherwise no special treatment.  
          

          _ __ _  _            3.37.6 ^V 
          Replots  up  to  24  lines  starting  with  either the first
          character received after the last character  keyboarded,  or
          about  48  lines  back if less than 400 characters have been
          received since the last character sent.    This  allows  the
          output  from  the  last command to be conveniently reviewed.
          Replot then awaits next replot command (see  below).    ^V^V
          typed quickly sends one ^V instead.

          Some versions of YAM expand tab characters to spaces on  the
          display.   BUG:  Since YAM does not decode cursor addressing
          commands, these commands should not be intermixed with  tabs
          on the same line.

          and all text characters for the  given  files.    Characters
          beginning with  CPMEOF  are  excluded.    On 8 bit versions,
          counts are modulo 64k.

          boot.  Any letters after x will  cause  the  command  to  be

          Semicolon is an optional command delimiter which may be used 
          in place of RETURN in order to place multiple commands on  a
          line.  Since commands such as "sb" have an indefinite number 
          of  operands,  the semicolon must be used to string commands
          together.  Example: "sb *.c;off"  batch  transmits  all  *.c
          files, then disconnects.  Unfortunately, CP/M's CCP clobbers 
          ;  and  everything  past  it  in  the  command  line, so use
          backslash instead.  
          
          

          3 45 NATHAN            3.45 NATHAN 
          The NATHAN command sends the rest of  the  physical  command
          line  to  the  host,  starting with the very next character.
          This command works with SUBMIT and XSUB (if lowercase  isn't
          needed).   Normally a cr/lf is sent as the end of each line,
          but this may be changed by relevant mode(s).

                N.B. Non-ASCII files or files  without  CR's  must  be

                See "propagating yam" below.  Often it is fairly  easy
                to  write  a simple receive routine which synchronizes
                with the sender by the simple expedient of echoing the

                bulletin board programs require a very long pause when

          Replot  maps  uppercase,  lowercase,  and control characters
          together in decoding commands.  


            b                                            b Display beginning of buffer.  

            k                                                       k Kill entire buffer contents and return.  

            v BS                                                                 v,BS Display previous page (some overlap is provided).  

            SP                                      SP Display the next page.  

            / Accept a search string, terminated by  return.    Search
                through  the  buffer  starting at the current location
                for the first (next) instance of that string  (matches
                either case).  Display page starts with that line.  If 
                the  search is unsuccessful, ring bell and jump to the
                beginning of the buffer.  

            n                                                                      n Search for next occurrence  of  the  previously  entered
                search string.  

            p                                              p Backup one line and redisplay.  

            LF                                 LF Advance one line.

                This restores the screen  and  keyboard  to  the  same
                state they  were  in  before  replot  was  entered.  X
                allows you to see where you were if you  were  in  the
                midst of  keyboarding  a  command  to the remote.  For
                example, suppose you are typing in a line of  commands

     9  Notes       9. Notes 

          
          When operating with  a  timesharing  system  and/or  through
          network   or   satellite   links,   considerable  delays  in
          transmission and responce  to  blocks  may  severely  reduce
          throughput of an FTP (file transfer protocol).  The k option 
          causes  the  s  command to use 1024 byte blocks, rather than
          the standard 128.  At high  baud  rates,  this  reduces  the
          protocol  related  overhead  up to 87 per cent, depending on
          file length, by reducing the number of blocks which must  be
          sent and  acknowledged  by  a factor of 8.  1024 byte blocks
          are selected by the sender.  An STX at the beginning of each 
          block (otherwise SOH for 128 bytes) inicates this  block  is
          1k long.    Pathnames  are always sent with 128 byte blocks.
          Buffering problems on some timesharing systems may  mitigate
          againgst use of 1k blocks at high baudrates.  
          
          Files  transmitted  from Unix to CP/M will be padded with ^Z
          characters as necessary to reach a length divisable by 128.  
          
          CP/M files sent with 1k blocks may not  compare  identically
          with  their  originals  due  to  the addition of up to seven
          extra 128 byte sectors (padded with CPMEOF).  
          
          Readiness to receive sectors with Cyclic Redundancy Check (2 
          bytes) instead of the usual additive checksum  is  indicated
          by  a  0103  (ASCII  "C") for initial "naks" instead of 025.
          CRC option is highly recommended.  It is  the  default  when
          using  batch  mode and/or 1k blocks, unless the 7 bit option
          is also in effect.  
          
          File transmission is compatible with MODEM7 in single  file,
          standard block  length  mode.    File  transmission  may  be
          aborted by sending a SEQUENCE of CAN (^X) characters.   Each
          character  keyboarded  will  cause  readline()  to  return a
          TIMEOUT error, thus regaining  keyboard  control  relatively
          easily.  
          
          Maximum  baudrate  possible  without errors using the t(erm)
          function  depends  on  the  computer  and   particular   yam
          implementation, but usually is 9600 baud.  
          
          
          Use these  numbers  for  comparison.  Your mileage and range
          may differ depending on clock speed,  circuit  distance  and
          RFI/EMI.  California estimate lower.  
          
          
          Quiet  mode  is  not necessary for proper operation at 19kb,
          although it does increase throughput slightly.  View  option

          (S  and  R  commands)  does  not decrease maximum baud rate,
          although throughput is obviously affected according  to  the
          ratio of terminal speed to communications rate.  
          
          Printer operation with bios calls or view mode substantially 
          reduces the highest baudrate possible with the term function 
          without  losing  characters  (independent  of actual printer
          speed).  The term function will send XOFF to prevent  buffer
          overflow  if  the  printer is on, or if a receive file is in
          use.  Term function on the Cromemco with a 300 baud  printer
          works fine at 4800 baud.  
          
          In  the  term  function, use of the circular buffer provides
          some advantages.  
          
               Incoming data may come in at a  rate  higher  than
               the display and/or printer.  Tab expansion for the 
               display does not compromise this ability.  
               
               The  user may decide to save a timesharing session
               on the disk AFTER it has started (or possibly even 
               finished) as long as the buffer pointers have  not
               wrapped around.  
               
               The same ability also applies to the printer.  The 
               printer need not be as fast as the host as long as 
               the Tortoise is allowed to catch up.  
               
               Received data may be redisplayed (rep command).  
               
          At  high  speeds,  the display will fall behind the incoming
          data, as storing of raw host  data  into  the  buffer  takes
          precedence over  all  else.    As  a  result, a defective or
          incorrectly programmed port which sources data at high speed 
          can lockout the keyboard.  If yam "goes away" when  entering
          the term function, this may be the cause.  
          
          If insufficient stack space is provided above the end of the 
          circular  buffer,  yam may sulk when attempting to exit from
          the term function.  The amount of stack space is  determined
          in   the   init   function   (in  yam1.c)  where  bufend  is
          initialized.  
          
          The t and z modes affecting dumping of  captured  data  take
          effect  when  the  circular buffer is written to the receive
          file, not as the characters are first received from the data 
          port.  
          
          The append option (available  if  receiving  filename  where
          filename  exists)  operates by calculating the length of the
          file,  searching  the  last  NSECTS  records  for  ^Z,   and
          positioning the pointers appropriately.  Since YAM fills the 
          rest  of  the entire last record with ^Z, the last record of
          an existing file may be "cleaned up" by the command sequence 
          "kill tc filename" which clears the  capture  buffer,  opens
          filename  for  append, and then closes it without adding any
          text.

     10  Communicating with TWX Machines       10. Communicating with TWX Machines 

          
          YAM has certain features which facilitate sending  files  to
          TWX machines.    Files  for  transmission  to  TWX  machines
          conventionally begin with the local answerback, which may be 
          triggered by a ^F in the file.  After the test of the  file,
          add an ENQ (^E) which releases the TWX machine's answerback, 
          another  ^F  to  send  your  answerback, and finally a ^D to
          allow the TWX machine to disconnect.  
          
          To send a file, the following sequence is recommended: 
          
          yam call name fq sendfile thqx logfile close off 
          
          Both sendfile  and  logfile  should  be  open  by  the  time
          connection  is made, or the called TWX machine may not get a
          timely response to its ENQ (^E).  Since YAM  uses  the  same
          file  descriptor  for  looking  up phone numbers and receive
          files, you cannot open the receive  file  before  using  the
          call command.  
          
          If printer operation is desired, change the thqx to thqxl.  
          


     11  Downloading Files from Unix TM  Systems       11. Downloading Files from Unix(TM) Systems 

          
          To download files from Unix systems with sb, invoke sb(1) to 
          send  the  desired  files  and  then  use  the yam ``r[yt]''
          command.  On Unix type: 
          
          sb file ...  
          
          Then exit term with ^E and give 
          
          ry 
          
          and file transfers will commence.  
          
          If the files are long, and/or if the  baudrate  is  limited,
          you can save time by squeezing them first with sq(1).  
          
          Versions  of  the  BDS  C  programs  SQ,  TYPE,  and USQ are
          available for  Unix  systems.    The  CP/M  version  of  USQ
          supports  a  -n option which will expand Unix NL's to CR/LF.
          The Unix version -n flag suppresses carriage returns.  
          
          If a file or set of files are to be transported between Unix 
          systems with yam, it is helpful to place them  in  a  tar(1)
          archive   (and   possibly   squeeze   the   archive)  before
          transmission.    This   proecedure   will    preserve    the
          modification  times  and  avoid  adding ^Z characters to the
          ends of files.  
          
          The -k option of sb will select 1  kb  block  length  rather
          than  the standard 128 bytes for improved throughput at high

          If  the  host  system  has YAM, XYAM, MODEM, XMODEM, tmodem,
          umodem, or something compatible, you can upload  files  with
          the  s  command  on  your  computer  and the corresponding r
          command on the remote.  Newer  versions  of  some  of  these
          programs  support  Cyclic Redundancy Check as an alternative
          to the simple checksum used by the original Ward Christensen 
          protocol.  CRC is much better  at  detecting  errors  and  I
          recommend its use where available.  
          
          Unfortunately,  this  protocol  is  not  implemented  on the
          popular timesharing services The Source and Compuserve.   It
          is  often  possible  to  upload  files  using the F command,
          perhaps with one or more modes.   Your  chances  of  success
          improve  if  you set "enab flow" when connecting to Telenet.
          If using Tymnet, type ^R^X just  before  the  host  computer
          name to  enable  flow  control  with XOFF and XON.  It often
          helps to use "half duplex" when connecting to the computer.  
          
          Yam4 implements the Compuserve `A' protocol which is  usable
          only on Compuserve's own network.  
          
          The  determined  hacker  will  divine  alternative  ways  to

          ``warp-drive''  term function to operate at the highest baud
          rates.  This may cause  confusion  as  some  of  the  subtle
          amenities of the regular term function are missing.

          Not all commands are implemented on all versuions.  
          
          When  YAM  is  used  with a terminal (or terminal emulation)
          which accepts commands to transmit information to  the  host
          (screen  dump, cursor position, ident, etc.), the characters
          so generated may cause YAM to do strange things.   The  most
          common  manifestation  of  this is in replot mode, where the
          automatically generated characters may  cause  YAM  to  exit
          replot.  
          

          14 1 Z 89            14.1 Z-89 
          Older  vintage  Z-89's  may  not operate properly at 9600 or
          19200 baud, most notably  with  the  Berkeley  Editor  which
          makes considerable  use of terminal capabilities.  Sometimes
          the CRT firmware gets so flustered that  it  must  be  reset
          with a ESC z.  This problem may be due to the Z-89 CPU board 
          baud rate clock being slightly slower than the incoming data 
          rate.  Selecting two stop bits on the host machine may solve 
          this problem.    Setting the CRT port to 19200 baud may also
          help.  This problem may show up with other  computers  using
          outboard CRT's.  a bad assumption for the ROM video software 
          on the  PC.   Yam versions ``yam and yamb'' will not operate
          with BIOSes that use keyboard interrupts,  but  ``yammcom'',
          which   uses   bios   calls   for   keyboard   input,  will.
          Unfortunately, BIOS keyboard input on the Z89  is  too  slow
          for yammcom to work properly at 9600 baud.  

          14 2 Z 100 CP M 85            14.2 Z-100 CP/M-85 
          Scrolling  speed  problems  appear at high baud rates (>1200
          baud).  However, the r function does work at 9600 baud  even
          if 1k blocks are being used.  

          14 3 HP 125            14.3 HP-125 
          The HP 125 computer consists of an intelligent terminal with 
          a number of peripherals, one of which happens to be an 8 bit 
          CP/M computer.    Porting yam to this contraption poses some
          difficulties as the computer running  yam  must  communicate
          ___  ___________ ________ __ ___ _____ _____ ____ __________           the  intelligent terminal to the modem while also displaying
          __ ____ ____                       on that same terminal.  
          
          When yam comes up on the 125, serial  port  1  is  selected.
          Yam  issues  a special HP function call to set serial port 1
          to 8 bit pass through mode.    Port  1  or  port  2  may  be
          selected with  the  mN  command.  Unfortunately, HP does not
          provide  a  function  to  make  the  second  port  similarly
          transparent.  
          
          Other  ports  may be selected by magical escape incantations
          entered (without spaces).  These map the desired serial port 
          to the CP/M reader and punch devices.  (See  Chapter  11  of
          the  HP  125  System  Refrence  Manual.) The first two lines
          select serial port 1.  The last two lines select serial port 
          2.  Refer to the manual for others.

          The aids key should then  be  pressed,  then  the  congifure
          function  to  set  the baud rate and other parameters on the
          desired port.  
          
          YAM on the 125 works marginally at  1200-9600  baud  in  the
          term function,  depending  on the situation (?).  The remote
          must be prepared to respond to XOFF and XON  at  all  times.
          When  using  the t function, there is a problem sending long
          files (longer than the  yam  buffer  size)  to  the  HP  125
          because  of  interference  betweent  flow control characters
          generated by the terminal firmware and yam itself.  
          
          Protocol file transfer (thru port #1) usually works at  9600
          baud but sometimes gets out of sync.  
          
          HP  has  not  documented  any  way for CP/M programs to send
          breaks and/or change baud rate.  
          
          The  HP-125  has  a  somewhat  non-standard  CP/M  operating
          system.  The undocumented bdos function 6 with 0xFE does not 
          work on the HP.  An ESC E sequence will cold boot CP/M.  
          
          If  an  asterisk appears in the AUTO LF function window, the
          HP-125 CP/M operates very strangely.  For example,  the  dir
          command suddenly forgets about most disk files.  In general, 
          CP/M  is  somewhat  fubar  in this mode; nothing works quite
          right.  That is not the only undesireable mode the hp125 can 
          get into.  
          
          Files may also be downloaded to the HP 125 using pip reading 
          from the RDR: device  (mapped  as  indicated  above).    The
          sender (such as yam) must respond to XOFF and XON.  Only hex 
          files  can  be  transferred this way as the terminal portion
          munges anything more exotic.  
          
          In fairness to the HP 125's designers, it  should  be  noted
          that  the  HP  125  terminal  section  sports  some of yam's
          features without need for a CP/M computer.  
          

          14 4 Televideo 820H            14.4 Televideo 820H 
          Yam for the Televideo 820H defaults to the rs232 port.   The
          baud  rate  should  always be set using the b command as yam
          cannot determine what baud rate was set before running  yam.
          To  select  the  printer port, give ``m33''. ``m32'' selects
          the rs232 port.
