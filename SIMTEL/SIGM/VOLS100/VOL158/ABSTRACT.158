1.  This incarnation of YAM: YAMC86, is **BASED ON** YAM by Chuck
    Forsberg.  The conversion to C86 syntax was performed by
    Paul Homchick, and consequently, support for this version is
    NOT available from Mr. Forsberg.

2.  This conversion is based on the 8-bit BDS C version (4.26).
    Syntax and certain sections of code have been changed so that
    it will now compile with the Computer Innovations C86 8086
    Compiler for use under CP/M 86.  The program will also work
    under CP/M 86 PLUS.  Version 1.33c of the C86 compiler was used
    during development of these files.

3.  This version has not been tested above 1200 baud.  Terminal emulation
    at 19.2K baud is probably beyond its capabilities.

3a. The YTERM() function was not translated to the 16-bit environment.

4.  An entry in the phones.t file that begins with the three letters:
    'cis' will cause yamc86 to enter t2 (cis 'a' protocol) mode instead
    of t mode, upon successful completion of a call.

5.  Since the files represent a direct translation from the 8-bit BDS C
    version, references in the documentation referring to the features
    of 16-bit versions may, or may not, be valid.

6.  Two yam5 / yamsys file combinations are provided.

	A.  PMMI MM-103 s-100 modem.

	B.  Hayes Smartmodem 1200 interfaced through a
	    CompuPro Interfacer 3/4 serial i/o board.

    These installations have been tested, and are known to work.
    Installation on other hardware will require writing your own
    yamsys.h and yam5.c (or modifying the supplied files).

7.  The XMODEM define has not been tested, so don't expect anything
    from it.

8.  The only defines that HAVE been tested are those defined in yampmmi.h
    and yamsmi4.h.

9.  The updcrc() and crck() fuctions which, in the 8-bit version, lived in
    yam8.csm and yam9.csm, are supplied as .a86 files suitable for use with
    the CI cvth86 program.  Use asm86.cmd to assemble updcrc.a86 and crck.a86.
    Use cvth86.cmd to transform the .h86 files from the assembler into .o
    files for use with the CI cl linker.

10. The manuals are supplied as Greenlaw-type squeezed files (YAMMAN.LQT &
    YAMIMPL.LQT).  A cp/m-86 version of the unsqeeze program (usq.cmd) is
    included with the distribution to expand the .LQT files.  Use the
    following syntax:

			usq x: y:*.lqt
                            |   \
                            |    - drive the distribution files are on
                            |
			    +----- drive you want the unsqeezed files on

    Make sure the destination drive (x:, above) has sufficient room.
    YAMIMPL.LST is a 44K file, and YAMMAN.LST is a 68K file.
 
11. YAM is for 'C' and communications wizards, or VERY ambitious beginners.
    To install YAM, you have to be proficient in interfacing to hardware
    using the 'C' language.  Like most (all?) Public Domain Software,
    handholding, support, and tutoring is available (if at all) only on an
    ad-hoc basis.
