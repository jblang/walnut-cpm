The "SIGNON" system consists of a variety of files intended for a variety of
purposes and uses, both by users calling the RCP/M system, and by the SYSOP
himself.  Included are the following:

*.BAS source code files for the main body of programs.
*.SSB more source code, subroutines.
*.MAC subroutines to allow things that MBASIC normally won't do.
*.SUB submit files as guides for various compilations.
*.DOC documentation on all of the above.

These programs are written for the Microsoft BASIC80 Compiler.  They will not
easily convert to run under the interpreter, but they have been pretty well
debugged and should give you little trouble.  (I have been using them on my
RCP/M for over a year (312-469-2597 at 300/600/1200 baud) and have been quite
satisfied with the performance).  If you do not have the MBASIC Compiler,
the recent version with the BRUN.COM module, then you'd better get it,
or get a friend to compile these programs for you.  You can't run without it.
The disadvantage of this system (the only one so far as I can determine) is
that it is programmed in BASIC.  This results in large .COM files that take
up a lot of disk space.  Maybe we can persuade Dick to rewrite it in "C"?

Other prerequisites: You must use a BYE program that will run a specified
.COM file on carrier loss (I use BYE 8.1).  (BYE version 2 might be made to
work, but I think some serious modifications and assembly language programming
may be required).  This is how the caller is logged off, his time-on-system
calculated and recorded.  XMODEM and other RCP/M utilities are assumed
(If you don't have them, check earlier SIG/M releases).

DESCRIPTION: SIGNON Version 1.2		9/29/82

Note, not all of the files are in the distribution package.  Those
in the standard distribution version are marked with a -.

Assuming you are prepared with the necessary prerequisites, what can this
system of programs do for you?  There are certainly other systems that
perform similar functions.  SIGNON serves as entry and exit for logging
a caller onto and off of the RCP/M, keeping track of time-on-system and
other data.  Other programs do the same, but I personally think that the
SIGNON system has its advantages.  Check out the DOC files and judge for
yourself.
