notes by Jim Mills regarding implementation of the SIGNON system.

The following three files were written for use with SIGNON under the
following conditions:

1. Use SIGNZCPR if you use ZCPR with the drive/user select/limit
mode -- ie: if you allow "A0>B: 5" to go to drive B user 5.  This
module will poke the appropriate values into lower memory for ZCPR
to limit drive and user# select properly.  Make sure the memory
locations poked match the memory locations specified when you
assembled ZCPR.  This version of SIGNON tested with NZCPR 1.6

2. Use SIGNCBBS if you use CBBS or MINICBBS instead of RBBS or
MINIRBBS.  This module changes the routines at line 4900 which
read the summary file and report any messages addressed to the user.
Tested with CBBS version 3.5

3. Use SIGNFALC if you use the Falco TS-1 Terminal and you want
the caller's first initial plus last name to appear on the status
line (convenient for telling at a glance who's online).  The
output is hardcoded to my CRT output ports so the user won't see
the escape sequences, etc.  Make appropriate changes to match your
hardware.  If you customize this routine for use with the status
line on a different terminal, please send a copy of the routine to
Dick Lieber or Jim Mills for incorporation into the "standard"
package.  Thanks.

The easiest way to implement the desired changes is to run MBASIC,
load SIGNON, then MERGE the appropriate sub-file (one of the above
files).  Be sure to delete any excess line numbers in the 4900
routine before you merge SIGNCBBS.BAS (if you use this option).
Failing to do so shouldn't hurt the operation, but it may save some
space in the compiled .COM file.
