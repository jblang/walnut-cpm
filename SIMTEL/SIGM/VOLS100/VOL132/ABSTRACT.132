1. It is always a pleasure to get new software, which this disk has, but
   it is even better to get old software that has been improved. Which is
   what John A McCulloch has sent us. He gave the program CheckBk
   (alias NOW) from Disk #15 to a friend. He added on-line changes in
   code assignments and the ability to edit and reconform the data stored
   in the file. So look this up-grade over and add to it.

	CHECKS.PAS		EXAMPL.DOC
	EXAMPL.CHK		EXAMPL.NAM

   John also sent these:

	BIOMO.PAS	John's first pascal program-a monthly bio-graf(tm)
			program. It has some commands specfic for the
			Epson MX-80 printer.Slow but interesting.
	EPSON.PAS/COM	Speaking of the Epson, John has up-dated some info
			on the Epson.
	ROTATE.BAS/COM  NO,that isn't a mistake. It's BAS. John just threw
			it in to give you something to do. Its a game that he
			tried to convert to Pascal but didn't finish. It 
			has sixteen factorial variations.
	QUIZ.TXT	How about something even simpler. Just read it
	QUIZANS.TXT	and see if you can answer the questions. For you
			smart ones, there are two answers in the Quizans
			file missing.
	WRITNUM.PAS/COM John improved a program from Disk #16 and it now
			handles up to $9,999.99. By adding a fixed point
			package or convert the data to strings this will
			work in a computational package.	

2.  Bob Longoria writes in several languages so when he sent me this bunch
    it included three different examples of his programing.

	LS.C/DOC/COM	This is a rather nice program to list your directory
			in that it gives you options as to how you want to
			do it. Uses c points.
	DEL.COM		Bob is commercial involved with this program at this
			time so he does not want to give out the source.
			Maybe later. However, you can use this as is o.k.
			It will allow you to delete files easily and safely.
			Try *.* to get you going. Nice way to clean a disk.
	ZDUMP.PAS/COM	Even tho this is yet another Dump program, it is
			in source and has lots of options to make it versitile.
			
3.  Clif Kinne's contributions will enhance any program. Read the DOC to
    get the details.

	READCMD.P/DOC/REL	This will handle arguments in a command tail.
	TESTCMD.P/COM		A demo for ReadCmd.
	GETNUMS.P/REL		An accessory to ReadCmd. It changes arguments
				that start with a number to an integer returns
				it as an array.
	CTOI.REL		A subsidary Function for ReadCmd.

4.  RAY PENLEY will make teachers happy with this one. It is an up-graded
    students program that has been cleaned up by an expert and the program
    does many things. It also is a good tutorial. The doc file is in the
    remarks heading of the PAS source. Look at it for sure.

	STUDENT.PAS/COM

5.  David Thorn sent this in as a informational item, it requires special
    equipment and some program modification to use, but it does illustrate
    just how a PROM BURNER handles itself. It is heavily commented so it
    is interesting to look at anyway.

	PROM.FIL

6.  When I reviewed what I had I saw that I needed at least one more
    program to fill it up.  I had more programs but they were all to
    big so I started to scratch around in my old files. I ran across
    an old BIOS that I had done many years ago, when I first started,
    so I thought why not! I paid a programer to do it for me so its
    mine. So if you need a SD Sales BIOS with Centronics parallel 
    driver using a VersFloppy I controller (formated for the 1771 and
    1791)you got it. I view it as a curiosity now and keep it because
    it is commented and that makes it a tutorial in my book.

	DBIOS.Z80


NOTE: Item 6 has been deleted from the SIG/M release and replace with
      TRACER, a monitor program from an earlier PASCAL Z volume. The
      documentation indicates a .COM file is also included and did not
      release it with rest of the volume it was on because we never
      received the .COM file and could not get it to assemble. Charlie
      Foster advises that PASCAL Z did not have a .COM file for it and
      sent us a new copy to include in the library.
