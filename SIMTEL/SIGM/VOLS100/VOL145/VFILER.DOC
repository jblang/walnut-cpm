			VFILER 1.7 by Richard Conn

	VFILER is a screen-oriented file manipulation utility.  Following
in the footsteps of SWEEP, CLEAN, and DISK, VFILER performs the same
fundamental functions, but adds screen-oriented displays and manipulation
to it, giving a more user-friendly interface in my opinion.

	VFILER must be installed for a user's terminal.  To do this, edit
VFILERSC.ASM, follow the directions contained therein, and set up this
file to support your CRT's clear screen, goto xy, and clear to end of line
functions.  Once done, assemble VFILERSC, patch it into VFILER by using
DDT (I and R commands, with no offset for R), and then save the result.
VFILER now is installed to run under CP/M.

	If the user is running ZCPR2, he should now run GENINS on VFILER,
do a normal installation, and write out the result.  VFILER will take advantage
of the special features of ZCPR2 if so installed.

	When VFILER is invoked, it displays a screen (up to 64) files to the
user with an arrow.  The user may use the Word Star cursor movement keys
(^E for up, ^X for down, ^D for right, ^S for left) to move the cursor
to point to a desired file.  Typing V will view the file on the CRT, P
will print it on the printer, C will copy it, D will delete it, etc.
See the command summary built into VFILER.

	VFILER knows all about the DU and DIR (if installed for ZCPR2) forms.
Under CP/M or ZCPR2, the DU form may be used.  For example, in response to
the Login command (L), the user may type any of the following:

		A	<-- log into Disk A, Current User
		5	<-- log into Current Disk, User 5
		A5	<-- log into Disk A, User 5
		wordst	<-- log into named dir (under ZCPR2)

The entries may or may not be followed by a colon, as the user desired
(i.e., 'A' and 'A:' mean the same thing).
