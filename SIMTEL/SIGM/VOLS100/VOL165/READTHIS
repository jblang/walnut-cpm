     REC - or Regular Expression Compiler - has been used in 
Mexico for some 20 years.  Through the kind assistance of Dr. 
Harold V. McIntosh of the Microcomputer Applications Group at the 
Universidad Autonoma de Puebla in Puebla, Mexico, SIG/M has 
obtained a copy of REC. It is being released on four volumes.

     Volume 1 (SIG/M 164) contains the Source Code for CP/M 80 
and CP/M 86 versions of REC. Volume 2 (SIG/M 165) contains the 
source code and compiled CP/M 80 and 86 utilities written with 
REC. Your editor has some difficulty compiling REC80 and 
Professor McIntosh provided on Volume 3 (SIG/M 166) a compiled 
version of REC80 and 86. (If you compile REC80 with M80 you will 
get an error because RECLIB allows linking into REC of FORTRAN, 
BASIC, PLM or other programs - a feature no longer used - but 
which does produce an error message which can be disregarded.)

     On Volume 3 we also have a 29K explanation of HOW TO USE 
REC.

     When we pointed out to the good doctor that most people
use ASM86 and not ACT86, he came up with a program that converts
ACT86 code into ASM86 code. This code is on Volume 4 (SIG/M 166)
as well as an assembly listing for REC86 in Digital Research ASM86
source code. In addition we have been provided with some video
graphics control programs and further applications of REC and CNVRT.

     This is indeed a monumental contribution to SIG/M and one that
we sincerely appreciate. Your comments and application programs are
also sought.
