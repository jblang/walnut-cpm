			MODEM901.FIX

	There is an error in the routine in CONSOLE.ASM which emulates
BDOS function 10. The error causes the program to restart itself when
ctrl-U (remove current line) is entered.

	To fix the COM file with DDT change location 265FH from JMP 0AD0H
to JMP 25D3H.

	The source code should read:

	.
	.
	.
;
INBUFO:	MVI	A,'#'
	CALL	CONOUT
	MVI	A,0DH
	CALL	CONOUT
	MVI	A,0AH
