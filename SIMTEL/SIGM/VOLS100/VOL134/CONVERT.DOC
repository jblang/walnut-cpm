HOW TO USE THE INTEGER AND REAL-NUMBER CONVERSION ROUTINES

I.  REAL NUMBERS

    GLOBALS.RN$ contains the required global CONST, TYPE, VAR, and
    PROCEDURE definitions;  PASZCODE.RN$ contains the executable code.

    Execute procedure RNSETUP at the start of your run, to initialize
    a table that is used for converting.  From then on, call function
    INTTOSTR to convert the string representation of a number to a
    real (flag GRERROR=TRUE if the string is not valid);  call RN$
    to convert a real to a ready-to-print string.  RN$ is capable of
    inserting punctuation (as for dollar-and-cents amounts), at your
    option.  See the comments to these routines for details.


II.  INTEGERS

    GLOBALS.INT contains the required global CONST and TYPE definitions;
    PASZCODE.INT contains the executable code.

    Call INTTOSTR to convert an integer to a string, ready for display;
    can be returned as a fixed-length field or with left padding
    omitted, at your option.  See the comments to the routine for details.
