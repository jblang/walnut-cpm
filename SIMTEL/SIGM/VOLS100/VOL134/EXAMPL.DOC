      EXAMPL.CHK  AND EXAMPL.NAM ARE DUMMY CHECK FILES CREATED  SO 
 YOU  CAN PLAY WITH THE VARIOUS CHECKING ROUTINE COMMANDS.   THERE 
 ARE TWO WAYS THAT YOU CAN CALL UP THIS FILE TO PLAY WITH.

 THE IMMEDIATE MODE:
 A>CHECKS EXAMPLE
 OR
 A>CHECKS
 AND  AFTER THE SIGN-ON MESSAGE USE THE G COMMAND AND SPECIFY  THE 
 FILENAME EXAMPL WHEN PROMPTED FOR INPUT.

      NOW YOU CAN PLAY WITH THE VARIOUS COMMANDS.   FOR EXAMPLE DO 
 THE FOLLOWING:
 O-----DISPLAYS OUTSTANDING CHECKS
 B-----SHOWS THE BALANCE IN THE ACCOUNT
 V-----SHOWS THE AMOUNT THE BANK THINKS YOU HAVE

      NOW TRY TO SEARCH THE FILE BY FLAGS USING THE I COMMAND  AND 
 USE THE FOLLOWING FLAG CHARACTERS.

 I--R--SHOWS RETURNED CHECKS
 I--W--SHOWS CHECKS WRITTEN BY MY WIFE
 I--G--SHOWS CHECKS WRITTEN FOR GASOLINE
 I--D--SHOWS DOCTOR BILLS
 I--C--SHOWS CAR EXPENSES
 I--U--SHOWS CHECKS WRITTEN FOR UTILITIES
 I--I--SHOWS INCOME TAX DEDUCTIBLE CHECKS (NONE YET)
      
      NOW  TRY  TO GET A LIST OF THE MNEMONIC NAMES USED  IN  THIS 
 FILE.  TO DO THIS HIT L AND SPECIFY N FOR THE ARGUMENT.  THEN HIT 
 AN   IMMEDIATE  CARRIAGE  RETURN  WHEN  ASKED  FOR  THE  MATCHING 
 CHARACTERS.   NOW  TRY  TO  GET A  LIST  OF  MNEMONIC  CHARACTERS 
 STARTING WITH THE CHARACTER A.  HOW ABOUT MNEMONICS STARTING WITH 
 CA?  

      NOW USE THE M COMMAND AND LIST ALL CHECKS WRITTEN TO TEXACO.
 YOU  DID IT RIGHT IF YOU TYPED M AND USED THE MNEMONIC TEX.   HOW 
 ABOUT GETTING THE CHECKS I WROTE FOR MY POWER  BILLS.   NOW,  YOU 
 PROBABLY  DON'T REMEMBER THE MNEMONIC...SO HOW DO YOU FIND  THEM.  
 WELL  THE  ELECTRIC POWER BILL IS A UTILITY SO YOU CAN USE THE  I 
 COMMAND  AND LIST ALL THE UTILITIES AND HUNT FOR THE  MNEMONIC  I 
 USED THAT WAY.   OR YOU COULD USE THE L COMMAND TO LIST NAMES AND 
 FIND IT THAT WAY ALSO.  EITHER WAY, YOU CAN FIND THE MNEMONIC AEP 
 FOR APPALACHIAN POWER COMPANY.

      NOW,  TRY RETURNING A FEW CHECKS.  YOU CAN USE THE O COMMAND 
 TO  LIST THOSE OUTSTANDING CHECKS AND USE THE R COMMAND  FOLLOWED 
 BY A CHECK NUMBER WHICH IS OUTSTANDING.   NOTICE THAT THE PROGRAM 
 WILL  DISPLAY THE CHECK AS IT IS RETURNED SO YOU CAN COMPARE  THE 
 AMOUNT OF THE RETURNED CHECK WITH THE AMOUNT IN THE PROGRAM..THIS 
 HELPS  YOU FIND SOME OF THOSE TYPING MISTAKES.   IF THE VALUES DO 
 NOT AGREE, YOU CAN USE THE F COMMAND TO FIX THE CHECK.  YOU MIGHT 
 TRY MODIFYING A FEW CHECKS...FOR EXAMPLE...CHANGE THE AMOUNTS AND 
 HIT  THE B COMMAND TO SHOW YOU THE BALANCE BEFORE AND AFTER  YOUR 
 CHANGE.   TRY  MODIFYING  A  FEW  DATES..OR  EVEN  ADDING  A  FEW 


 THE W FLAG IN THE FLAG COLUMN.  USE THE I COMMAND FOLLOWED BY THE 
 FLAG W BEFORE AND AFTER YOU MAKE THIS CHANGE TO BE SURE IT WORKS.

      NOW PRINT OUT A TALLY SHEET FOR JANUARY.   DO THIS BY  USING 
 THE T COMMAND AND SPECIFYING THE MONTH 1.   HOW ABOUT GETTING THE 
 LISTING  ON  THE PRINTER.   USE THE P COMMAND FOLLOWED BY  THE  T 
 COMMAND AND SPECIFY MONTH 1.  TRY PRINTING OUT ALL THOSE GASOLINE 
 BILLS ON THE PRINTER.   YES,  ITS THE P COMMAND FOLLOWED BY THE I 
 COMMAND USING THE FLAG G.  

      NOW  ENTER A FEW CHECKS OF YOUR OWN.   HIT THE O COMMAND  TO 
 FIND MY LAST OUTSTANDING CHECK NUMBER.   NOW USE THE A COMMAND TO 
 SET  THE AUTONUMBER MODE AND SPECIFY THE NEXT CHECK NUMBER.   HIT 
 THE  C COMMAND AND FILL IN THE BLANKS USING THE SPACE BAR TO  TAB 
 YOU  TO THE NEXT ENTRY FIELD.   TRY DREAMING UP SOME OF YOUR  OWN 
 CHECK MNEMONICS.   WHENEVER THE PROGRAM ASKS YOU IF THIS IS A NEW 
 NAME, IT DID NOT FIND A MATCH WITH THE MNEMONIC YOU USED WITH ANY 
 ALREADY IN THE NAME FILE.

      HIT THE S COMMAND TO SAVE THE FILE AWAY.   THE PROGRAM  WILL 
 SHOW  YOU THE FILE NAMES UNDER WHICH THE DATA WILL BE SAVED AWAY.  
 YOU CAN OVERWRITE THE EXISTING FILE BY HITTING Y OR USE N IF  YOU 
 WANT  TO SAVE THE DATA UNDER A NEW NAME.   NOTICE THAT AFTER  THE 
 DATA  IS  SAVED AWAY,  YOU ARE STILL IN THE PROGRAM WITH ALL  THE 
 DATA STILL THERE.   IT IS WISE TO OCCASIONALLY USE THE S  COMMAND 
 DURING   LONG   EDITING  SESSIONS  TO  SAVE  AWAY   THE   CURRENT 
 FILE..ESPECIALLY  IF IT IS THUNDERING AND LIGHTNING OUTSIDE BECUZ 
 ANY  POWER GLITCH WILL THROW ALL THAT TYPING AWAY.   IN  CASE  IT 
 SHOULD ,  THE OLD FILE IS STILL ON THE DISK IN THE SAME CONDITION 
 IT  WAS  WHEN  YOU LAST CALLED IT UP OR AS IT WAS WHEN  YOU  LAST 
 SAVED IT AWAY.  

      TRY  MAKING  A  FEW DEPOSITS---D  COMMAND-- OR  MAKE  A  FEW 
 WITHDRAWALS  FROM  THE  ACCOUNT WITH THE W COMMAND.   USE  THE  V 
 COMMAND  TO  GET  THE  BANK BALANCE BEFORE  AND  AFTER  MAKING  A 
 WITHDRAWAL.   WITHDRAWALS ARE IMMEDIATLEY DEDUCTED FROM THE  BANK 
 BALANCE.  

      HIT THE ? COMMAND.  PLAY WITH THE PROGRAM AND GET A FEEL FOR 
 IT.  WHEN YOU ARE COMFORTABLE WITH IT, HIT THE Q COMMAND AND EXIT 
 BACK  TO CP/M.   IT'S NOW TIME TO OPEN UP YOUR OWN FILE FOR  REAL 
 AND HAVE A BALL....
