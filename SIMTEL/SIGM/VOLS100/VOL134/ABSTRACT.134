	TSTAN2.COM/PAS	Inputs a regression coefficient to be
			converted to the correspnding slope angle.
	TRIGLIB.PAS	Contains seven (7) Functions dealing
			with trig.
	PROFILE.SRC	A PASCAL/Z external routine to fill arrays X
			and Y using a Houston HIPAD Digitizer for
			input.
	TP.PAS		This program uses PROFILE.
	MACRO.SRC	Some macro's Greg has collected.
	DRVCHK.PAS	A procedure to ensure that a character to be
			used as a filename prefix refers to a legal 
			drive.

2.  Harry Muttart, of Cupertino Ca, has submitted some nice routines.

	CLEAN.PAS
	CLEANPRT.PAS	These two were used to filter characters 
			that upset his printer.
	BINTOHEX.PAS	This converts each character of a binary
			file to two ASCII hex digits. 
	HEXTOBIN.PAS	This converts the other way, hex to binary.
	GETFILES.PAS	Harry didn't say anything about this procedure
			but it looked interesting so I threw it in
			anyway. It may be a duplicate but only 2K made
			it a cheap gamble.

3.  Roy Allen, of Mill Valley CA, has done some updating and submitted
    some new stuff.

	ANIMALS.COM/PAS	This is a simple game that Roy submitted 
			before. He found two bugs so he is re-submiting 
			it. 

	CONVERT.DOC	This is the DOC for the rest of his submissions.

	GLOBALS.RN$	This converts numbers between STRING and REAL
	PASZCODE.RN$	representation.

	GLOBALS.INT	This converts integers to STRING representation.
	PASZCODE.INT

4.  This Z80 program fascinated me because I had written a check 
    program in Pascal and also in DBase II. It is interesting how
    Ralph Sherman, of Forest Va, handled everything. I got this through
    the BigBoard Users Group (one of our members is a member) and hope
    they continue to expand and grow. Anyway, here is a example to
    examine on how to write an applications program in assembly.

	CHECKS.COM/Z80/DOC	A check program in assembly.
	EXAMPL.CHK/.NAM/DOC	The check demo to practice upon.
