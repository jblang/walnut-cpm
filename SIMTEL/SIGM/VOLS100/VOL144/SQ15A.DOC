SQ version 1.5a is an experimental outgrowth of Richard
Greenlaw's file compression utility.  Note that it was
developed by modifying SQ 1.5, not 1.6 which has been in
the public domain for a year or so.

1.5a changes:

a)	Directed I/O support was removed.

b)	Leor Zolman's WILDEXP command-line interface was
	added.  All file and output drive specifications
	are taken from the command line.

c)	Output file sizes are checked against input file
	sizes.  If SQ finds a file which doesn't compress
	very well then it discards the output file, and,
	if the output was on a different disk from the
	input file then the input file is simply copied
	to the destination disk.

d)	A command-line option consisting of a single plus
	sign (+) causes SQ to ask whether or not to
	discard a poorly-compressed file.

e)	Files of 8 sectors or less are never squeezed.
	Even on single-density standard CP/M interchange
	disks no space saving would be realised and, when
	transferring such files by modem the saving in
	transmission time is not significant.

Examples:

1	A>sq *.c *.asm

	squeezes all .C and .ASM files on the logged-in
	disk.

2	A>sq b: *.c *.asm

	same as above except that the squeezed files are
	written to the B: disk.

3	A>sq b: *.c + *.asm

	same again except that if a .ASM file is found not
	to compress well then SQ will ask whether or not to
	discard the output file and copy the original.

4	A>sq b: *.* !*.com

	squeeze all except .COM files and write the output
	files to the B: disk.

Note that this IS a pre-release version of SQ.  PLEASE USE
IT AND REPORT ANY BUGS OR SUBMIT ANY SUGGESTIONS via this
system or to
