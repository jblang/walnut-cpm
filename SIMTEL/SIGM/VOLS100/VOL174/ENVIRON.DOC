	ROFF4, version 1.60 was developed with the BDS C
compiler, version 1.44 and the Mark of the Unicorn L2 linker
version 2.2 on an Exidy Sorcerer personal Computer with the
S-100 expansion box. The Thinker Toys 2D dual 8" disk sub-
system was used and total contiguous ram was 52K.
Statistics from the BDS compiler indicated at least 12K left
over at every stage. Thus it may be possible to recompile
this in a 40K system.  Tthe linkage statistics are that we
have 131 functions, code ends at 7886H, and that externals
are from 7900H-92F6H.

	I released version 1.50 last summer to the BDS C Users'
Group and to SIG/M (volume 126).  In addition to a description
that appeared in the BDSCUG newsletter, it has been briefly
reviewed by Chris Terry's column, "In the Public Domain" that
was in the January 1984 issue of MICROSYSTEMS.

	To run ROFF4.COM I believe the TPA should be 44K or
more because the alloc() function must allocate slightly
more than 1K for each simultaneously open file and I have
reserved (quite conservatively) 2K for the stack.

	I/O requirements are minimal.  A dumb terminal (video
or printing) and the CP/M disk interface are sufficient.
Although a list device seems like a practical necessity (do
you want to format only to a glass terminal?)

	By all means, read the file, ROFF4.DOC ("when all
else fails, read the manual!")  Try out the sample input
files, they are probably better illustration of points where
my writing isn't clear.

	Enjoy... (leave the debugging to us).
