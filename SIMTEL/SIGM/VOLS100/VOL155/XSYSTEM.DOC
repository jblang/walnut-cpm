How to Use this Program

     1.   Establish the Start of the File

          To  start  the system a starting balance must exist  in 
          the ABUSBANK.DBF file.   Use the file through dBase  II 
          in  the manual mode to enter a starting balance.   This 
          is done by the following commands:
               1.   . USE ABUSBANK
               2.   . APPEND
          Add the Beginning Balance with 0 in the "NUMBER" field, 
          BEGINNING  BALANCE  in the "TO" field and  the  balance 
          amount  in  the  "AMOUNT"  field.   Place a  T  in  the 
          "CANCEL" and in the "PRINTED" fields.

          To exit the append mode depress carriage return at  the 
          first field of the second record.

     2.   Initialize the Main Index

          To  initialize the Main index (CKNUM.NDX),  at the  "." 
          type  USE  ABUSBANK.   Follow with INDEX ON  NUMBER  TO 
          CKNUM.   This  will establish the index with the record 
          just added to the main records.

     3.   Entering data

          Enter checks just as you would do on the check  itself.  
          The  system  will  prompt you for  the  data  required.  
          Cancel only those checks that have cleared the bank and 
          have  been  returned  to you.   A cancelled  check  and 
          deposit is one that has been recorded by the bank.  You 
          will  be  prompted  to make sure you want  to  add  the 
          record  so recheck your data to be sure it is  correct.  
          The  decimal check number is to be used to  enter  bank 
          charges and money machine transactions.   Use the check 
          number  nearest the bank transaction in non-check  form 
          and  enter with a decimal digit.   Thus,  if  the  last 
          check written is number 456 and you want to use a money 
          machine the check number for that transaction should be 
          456.1  and a subsequent bank charge would be 456.2  and 
          so  forth.   It would be wise to enter these numbers in 
          the  checkbook  to keep track of which decimal  to  use 
          next.

     4.   Cancelling Checks and Deposits

          When  checks are returned and the bank statement  gives 
          the deposits recorded by the bank it is time to  cancel 
          the checks and deposits on file.   Checks are cancelled 
          by  check number and deposits are cancelled by  looking 
          up those deposits not yet cancelled.   Recheck the data 
          and  use  the mofify checks or deposits options on  the 
          main menu to correct mistakes.

     5.   Getting Balances and Reconcillations

          Select the Balance Option on the Main Menu.   This will 
          yield both the balance on the bank statement and in the 
          checkbook.   Outstanding  checks and deposits  will  be 
          totaled  and itemized if the selection is made to get a 
          Reconcillation.   Reconcillations  go  to  the  printer 
          automatically so be sure it is on.

     6.   Getting Printed Data

          Select  the  Print Data Option at the main  menu  AFTER 
          getting  all indexes produced.   You will be unable  to 
          get printed results without indexes being available.

Note:   These  programs  assume an Epson Dot Matrix  Printer  for 
printing.  If the printer is not an Epson or doesn't use the same 
control codes for Double Width and Condensed type these will have 
to  be  changed in both the file XBALANCE.CMD  and  XPRNTCKS.CMD.
