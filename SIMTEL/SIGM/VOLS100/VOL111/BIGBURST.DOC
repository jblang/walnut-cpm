    The purpose of this program is to backup and restore files from
a hard disk to floppy disks where the file is too big to fit on one
floppy.  The program works by copying the big file to multiple files
where each file has a sequence number for the file type.  The last
record of the last file has an indicator that there are no more files
to load.
    To backup a large file, enter
         A>BIGBURST TESTFILE.ASM/B
Where TESTFILE.ASM is the large file on the hard disk and the "/B"
tells the program that this is a BACKUP operation.  The program
will make sure the file exists on the hard disk, and as you to
mount a floppy.  It will name the file on floppy 1 as TESTFILE.001,
file on floppy 2 as TESTFILE.002, etc until the entire file is copied.
    To restore the large file, enter
         A>BIGBURST TESTFILE.ASM/R
Where TESTFILE.ASM is the large file on the hard disk and the "/R"
tells the program that this is a RESTORE operation.  The program
will then tell you to mount the diskette containing TESTFILE.001.
If you enter the wrong diskette, it will tell you to mount the
right one.  The pogram creates TESTFILE.$$$ until the entire
process is complete.  If TESTFILE.ASM already exists on the hard
disk, it will be renamed TESTFILE.BAK and any other copies of
TESTFILE.BAK will be deleted.  When the restore is successful,
it will rename TESTFILE.$$$ as TESTFILE.ASM, but you will still
have the original file as a backup if neccessary.
    The only program modification required is to set the floppy disk
drive and reassemble.  It is currently set for drive D: as indicated
in the line 'FLOPPY  EQU 4'.  If your floppy is on F: set that to 5,
G: = 6, ...A:=1, B:=2, C:=3 etc.  The program uses all of available
memory as the copy buffer.  For diagnostic purposes, the program prints
out the record number just copied after copying each buffer.  This
can be removed be deleting all references to DEBUG.
