Description.

CISTRN looks and acts in most respects
like the standard TELCOM program
included in the Model 100 ROM.  In
fact, for the most part it is the
TELCOM program.  In a few places
actions of TELCOM are intercepted to
provide additional functions.

CISTRN allows error free uploading and
downloading using the CIS A protocol.
This protocol is available on
CompuServe for uploading to your own
file space or downloading from your
file space, public access or sig
access.  Programs are also available
which allow uploading and downloading
to CP/M based systems (and perhaps to
others).

To upload or download you must be using
an 8 bit setting (e.g. m8n1e).

To upload or download to your file
area, go to programming (the OK prompt)
and type

	r xftran

You will be prompted for additional
information.

To download from public or sig access
type

	dow <filename>

where <filename> is the name of the
file on CompuServe you wish to
download.  You will be prompted for the
name on the Model 100.

Only ascii files can be transfered.
The extension on the model 100 is
always .DO which need not be entered.

All facilities of TELCOM may be used
except the standard uploading and
downloading of files.  These do still
appear on the label line, but will be
ignored.

The auto power off facility will not
work in CISTRN, so be sure to exit
and turn the machine off when you are
finished.  NEVER TURN OFF THE MACHINE
WHILE IN CISTRN.  This may hang the
Model 100.


Installation.

You will need CISTRN.100 (CISTRN.BA on
the Model 100), CISTRN.HEX (CISTRN.DO
on the Model 100) and HEXLDR.BA.  Run
HEXLDR.BA.  In response to the file
name prompt, type

	CISTRN

Loading will take a little while.  At
the end, you will have CISTRN.CO.  You
may then delete CISTRN.DO and
HEXLDR.BA (keep copies on cassette for
backup).  To execute CISTRN just run
CISTRN.BA.


Known Deficiencies

-  ASCII capture and send (standard
   TELCOM up and down) are not
   available.

-  The Model 100 may hang if power is
   turned off in CISTRN.

-  It is not possible to leave CISTRN
   without disconnecting the built in
   modem.
