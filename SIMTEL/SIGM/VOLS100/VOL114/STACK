<R	S: TOS -->
	R:     --> TOS
	{pushes TOS onto Return Stack.}

>	Pops (discards) top (most recent) entry from
	Vocabulary Stack.  Changes search path for 
	stored definitions.

CASE@	TOS --> CASESTACK[CASESTACKPOINTER-TOS]

CHKLMT	Constant that specifies the maximum size of the
	Check stack (that is used to check syntax and
	which appears as part of the prompt).

DDUP	NTT TOS --> NTT TOS NTT TOS

DUP	TOS --> TOS TOS

L@	TOS --> LOOPSTACK[LOOPSTACKPOINTER-TOS]

LSIZE	Constant that specifies the size of the LOOPSTACK.
	{a DO-LOOP takes three levels}.

PISTOL<	Pushes the PISTOL vocabulary on the top of the
	Vocabulary Stack.  Thus the first set of definitions
	in the search path will then be the "standard PISTOL"
	definitions.

R@	TOS --> RETURNSTACK[RETURNSTACKPOINTER-TOS]

R>	Transfers the top of the Return Stack onto the top
	of the (Parameter) Stack.

RP	--> (current number of items on Return Stack)
	{"Return Stack Pointer"}.

RSIZE	Constant indicating the maximum capacity of the
	Return Stack.

RSTACK	Displays the current size and contents of the
	Return Stack. {No side effects other than i/o}.

S@	TOS --> STACK[STACKPOINTER-TOS]
	{ "0 S@" produces the same result as "DUP" }.

SP	--> (number of items on Parameter Stack)
	{"Stack Pointer".}

SSIZE	Constant indicating the maximum size of the
	(Parameter) Stack.

STACK	Displays the current size and contents of the
	(Parameter) Stack. {No side effects other than i/o}.

SYNTAXBASE
	Provides pointer to string area where the Syntax
	Checking Stackpointer resides; immediately above
	the contents of the Check Stack are located.
	{"SYNTAXBASE MSG" would produce a display of the
	 part of the prompt that shows which structures
	 have been entered, but not yet exited during
	 compilation.}

UNDER	NTT TOS --> TOS

UNLINKED<
	Places on top of the Vocabulary Stack the "Unlinked"
	Vocabulary.  This vocabulary contains definitions
	that have subsequently been UNLINKed (probably because
	of their obscurity or danger).

VSIZE	Constant indicating the maximum capacity of the
	Vocabulary Stack.

:

	TOS - "Top Of Stack"

	NTT - "Next To Top" of stack

	TFT - "Third From Top" of stack

	FFT - "Fourth From Top" of stack
