[reverse a binary string]

[a catalytic * appears in front of the string]
[it turns zeroes into a's, ones into b's]
[a's and b's have high priority to drift right across 0's and 1's]
[when there are no more 0's or 1's to turn into a's and b's, the
 * drifts right, restoring a's and b's to their binary equivalents]
[when there are no more a's and b's to restore, * vanishes, process stops]

[In a Markov algorithm, only consecutive symbols can be transformed. Thus
 it is very common to find a catalyst, or escort symbol being created at
 the very lowest level of priority. It seeks out certain configurations
 to which it is attuned, often casting them into an alternative alphabet.
 The activated symbols then have a high priority mobility, which allows
 them to pair themselves up with selected counterparts. Once the proper
 pairs or other groupings are in contact, another set of rules can carry
 out the real computation which is the objective of the rule set.]

[When a Markov algorithm gets to be quite complicated, several catalysts,
 or cursors, can be active. Alternative alphabets provide the equivalent
 of subroutines, since a group of rules will only respond to letters from
 its own alphabet. Likewise the ordering of the rules, by giving each of
 them its own relative priority, has an important bearing on the way in
 which the algorithm is executed.]

[[This algorithm will reverse a binary string. Type a
sequence of 0`s or 1`s, followed by a carriage return.

With each successive keystroke, an additional step in
the execution of the algorithm will be shown.
