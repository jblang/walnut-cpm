	This is the first of several disks donated by Greg Acland.
They are different in that most of the programs are Procedures or
Functions. There are some programs but the emphasis is on building
up a library. Greg has also adapted some algorithms from the 
collected algorithms of ACM so they are heavy in MATH. Many of these
call each other so I have tried to keep them togeather. They all came
with REL files but I did not include them to save space although they
did prove they could be compiled and assembled. All adapted to Pascal/Z.


ALPH2INT.PAS	Function that takes a Pascal/Z string and if accepted
		returns the integer value equivalent.
CASELIB.PAS	Function that accepts any char, if lower case,returns
		upper case otherwise returns input.
CLOCK.SRC	Calender clock master program,has menu.
CONFINE.PAS	Procedure that returns standard deviation.No Comments
DATE.SRC	Uses clock board.
DATENTIM.PAS	Procedure to print Date/Time from clock chip OKI MSM
		5832 on the GODBOUT SSI board.(easily modified for others)
DECOMPOS.PAS	Matrix function translated into Pascal/Z from algorithm
		423 of collected Alg. of ACM.
INITSEED.	Procedure for getting a seed by calling "Time". 
LEVEL.PAS	Procedure to use "HIPAD" to print oversize.
LITEPEN.SRC	Function to read port of light pen.
MEDIAN.PAS	Procedure to determine median value of the array "List".
NAMEDATE.PAS	Procedure to change date as integers to month and day
		of week as strings.
POPSTATS.PAS	Large Procedure to calculate an array of "a"(real numbers)
		via mean, mode,median,etc,etc.
QQSORTR.PAS	Updated QQSORT by Ray Penley.
SOLVE.PAS	Procedure to work on vectors, algorithm 423 from ACM.
READREAL.PAS 	Procedure to allow a real variable to be input from the
		console in a more forgiving and flexible manner.
RNDKNUTH.LIB	The Knuth random Gen substractive method.
SELECT.PAS	Function to partially sort array, can be used to find Median.
SMOOTH9.PAS	Function to perform a 9 point digital smoothing on the
		data in an input array.
TIME.SRC	Subroutine to read a digit from the clock, put in string.
WEEKDAY.PAS	Function to change date to number from 0 to 6.
ZELLER.PAS	Procedure that given a date will return the number of days
		since 0 A.D.
BEEP.SRC	Procedure to ring bell.
BLNKSCRN.SRC 	Procedure to blink.
CHARIN.SRC	Procedure to input char.
CHAROUT.SRC 	Procedure to output char.
CLRHOM.SRC	Procedure to clear screen and homes cursor.
CMPTXT.SRC	Procedure to compare two ASCII strings of any length.
DRVLOG.SRC	Routine to determine which drive is logged.
GETEXT.SRC	Routine to get text from console.
HEXOUT.SRC	Hex print to console from calling program.
KARET.SRC	Outputs CR/LF to console.
KBDIN.SRC	Checks keybourd, returns with ASCII in A.
MESIJ.SRC	Prints the message to console.
MNANDVAR.PAS	Procedure to get mean/variance.
PLOT.PAS	Modified from Miller, plots Y and calculates as functions
		of X for M points.
POINT.SRC	Reads Hipad via mid-port for X,Y cordinates.
READQ.SRC	Reads console but does not wait for CR.
STREAM.SRC	Reads a stream from Hi-Pad.
USEPLOT.PAS	Used as shell to Plot.
USEWLREG.PAS	Program to test plot procedures.
WAVE.SRC	Fill array from Hi-Pad in stream mode.
		
End.
