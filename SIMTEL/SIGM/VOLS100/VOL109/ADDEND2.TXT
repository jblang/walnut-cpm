To get theL1130   second occurrance of a character, enter control-d and the characterI1140   a second time.  You do not have to enter the character itself to&1150   fill in the first occurrance.1160 N11702) The @ character can be used as a valid input character.  It no longer21180   will be accepted as an editing character.1190 L12003) BOOT has been changed to always jump to E800.  This is because bothG1210   new single and double density boards have the prom at E800 andF1220   only the very old single density boards use the prom at E900.1230 K12404) The question about memory size has been deleted from the configureG1250   procedure.  Instead the program will determine the memory sizeK1260   itself.  This is done by writing zeroes throughout memory and thenN1270   reading them back.  When it does not get a zero back, it assumes thatL1280   is the top of memory.  If this top does not fall on a page boundry,J1290   the message "MEMORY ERROR AT XXXX" will be printed warning you ofK1300   a possible memory problem.  If you want to force the top of memoryJ1310   to be something other than the true top, change the top-of-memory1320   variable at 2D41H.1330 I13405) The word PAGE has been eliminated from the first line during theB1350   PRINT command.  Page numbers will still appear as before.1360 H13706) When you edit a line using the EDIT command, a right arrow willJ1380   appear on the line ahead of the edited line.  The purpose of thisF1390   is to indicate that what comes next is the edited line and toJ1400   shift the line over one character to line up with any lines above/1410   it that you may want to pattern after.1420 M14307) Bugs in BSAVE/BLOAD, comment lines, and NSAVE have been checked out.K1440   Since many double density users are also using quad density, NSAVEH1450   does not check for room on a disk.  This is because a file thatK1460   would not fit on a double density disk would fit on a quad densityK1470   disk by writing on the second side.  Someone with a double densityM1480   disk, however, may get a disk error trying to write to a nonexistantK1490   track in the last file on the disk.  This is not a bug, but ratherH1500   a lack of intelligence by the program.  If you get a disk errorG1510   trying to NSAVE the last file on a disk, simply put in anotherH1520   disk with more space.  Also remember that the file size createdL1530   during NSAVE is four blocks larger than the size displayed with theD1540   FREE command.  The line number bug in BSAVE has been fixed.1550 +15608) The data area now begins at 6100H.1570 I15809) The default system, prior to using CONFIGURE, is now set for 24KI1590   of memory starting at 2000H, a 24 line CRT, a 78 character inputF1600   line, continuous forms printer, and line wrap around enabled.1610 G162010) When using the insert feature in EDIT, the line length may goA1630   beyond the screen length to a maximum of 138 characters.
