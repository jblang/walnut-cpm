1000#COMMENT USERMAN41020\1040<EDITING A LINE OF TEXT1060  B1080    [By entering the command EDIT LN1, LN1 is used to create@1100a new line.  This new line is the old line LN1 modified byA1120certain control characters.  For a full discussion of this ?1140capability, see the North Star BASIC manual.  The editing)1160control characters are as follows:]1180  E1200CONTROL-G Copy the remaining portion of the old line to the end 1220          of the new line.H1240CONTROL-D Copy up to a specific character.  This control characterJ1260          requires a second character to be entered.  SECRETARY willI1280          scan the old line for this second character, and if it isF1300          found, copy all the characters up to but not including51320          the second character to the new line.G1340CONTROL-Z Delete one character from the old line.  A percent signH1360          is echoed back to indicate a character has been deleted."1380CONTROL-A Copy one character'1400CONTROL-Q Backspace one characterI1420          You can also use the character that you defined to be the91440          backspace character to backspace in EDIT.I1460CONTROL-Y Toggle insert mode.  The first time control-Y is entered,I1480          the new line is "opened up" and all subsequent charactersH1500          are added to the new line.  The second time control-Y isI1520          entered, the new line is "closed" so  that characters are#1540          no longer inserted.#1560CONTROL-N Reedit the new line#1580CONTROL-P Reedit the old lineF1600CONTROL-C Exit this command and leave the line as it was before.1620\1640<WORD PROCESSING FEATURES1660  J1680    [Two of the primary features of word processing are line fillingH1700and justification.  Line filling is the process of adding words toA1720a line until the addition of one more word would exceed the%1740maximum specified line length.]D1760    [After the line is filled, spaces are added to the line soH1780that the right margins are aligned.  This is called justification.A1800Justification is done by first adding a blank at each point1820where thereG1840are two or more blanks.  Then if the line is still not justified,?1860add a blank at each point where there is only one blank.]A1880    [Not all text should be line filled and justified sinceE1900paragraphs would be run together if they were.  Groups of linesG1920to be filled must be enclosed in brackets to use this function.  /1940A left bracket precedes those lines to be91960line filled and justified;  a right bracket followsA1980those lines to be line filled and justified.  In addition, 22000justifying will not occur unless the justifyH2020switch was turned on by using the JUSTIFY command when you print.]G2040     [The size of a page may vary with the paper used. 8 1/2 X 11>2060inch paper contains 66 lines (6 lines to an inch).  WithD2080a one inch margin at the top and bottom, there are 54 lines of>2100print and the first line begins on line 7.  These valuesI2120can be changed with the PAGE command and SECRETARY will advance the%2140page as needed.  Secretary willF2160print the title starting at the left margin, and the word "PAGE"12180and page number ending at the right margin.F2200The starting page number can be changed using the PNUM command.]D2220    [Certain text may need to start on the top of a page.  In L2240this case the backslash (shift-L on ASR-33 or 5CH) should be the firstC2260character of the line.  Upon encountering this character, the92280paper will be advanced to the top of the next page.;2300If the backslash is followed immediately by a number,@2320the page will only be ejected if that number of lines will 2340not fit on the same page.]?2360    [Text may be centered on a line by preceding the text?2380with a "less than" character, 03CH.  All text between theA2400"less than" character and the next carriage return will be A2420centered on the line.  This text should not be enclosed in C2440line-fill brackets.  The actual starting position of the textB2460will change depending on the line length.  The length of the>2480centered text must be less than the length of the line.]H2500    [If multiple copies of a text are required, the REPEAT commandD2520can be used to automatically print more than one copy.  At theK2540end of the printing, however, the repeat count will be reset to zero.<2560A zero or one repeat count will still print one copy.]?2580    [Spacing can be changed to single, double, or triple *2600spacing by using the SPACE command.]A2620    [After the print line has been linefilled and justifiedC2640(if these features were used) and before the line is printed,J2660the line is scanned for the character specified in the CALL command.E2680If the character is found, the user's routine is called.  This ?2700allows the user to modify the line before it is printed.]2710\G2720    [Tabs may be used to force the data to be printed in columns.L2740To use this feature, first use the TABSET command to define the columnR2760locations of the tabs.  Then as you enter the data, use the tab key (hex 09)K2780just as you would on a typewriter.  The tab character will echo as anP2800at sign, @, when inputting the line.  The tabs will be expanded during the<2820PRINT command only -- not during the LIST or on input.2840Do not use tabs withinI2860brackets used for line filling or justification since spaces may beG2880added to justify the line and lose the columns.  If more tabs areN2900entered than were defined in TABSET, the extra tabs will be ignored.  IfK2920the current character position is beyond a tab and a tab character isH2940encountered, the line will advance to the next tab if it exists or/2960will ignore it if no more have been set.]?2980    [Data can be MERGEd into your text from a BASIC file.C3000The text just needs an up-arrow ^ at each place data is to be?3020inserted.  The BASIC data file must be  a type 3 file, it@3040must contain only string records less than 256 bytes long,93060and the substrings to be inserted at each ^ must be=3080separated by plus signs.  See Section 1 Part 6 for more3100details.]Q3120    [The normal margins begin in column 1 and end in the column defined by 73140the line length or the LINE command (default 70).E3160The entire page can be shifted to the right by using the OFFSETJ3180command.  This can also be done by using the MARGIN command.  It is 3200sometimesR3220desirable to have an entire paragraph indented on the right and/or the left.Q3240This is the variable margin feature and is activated by a special characterM3260-- the right arrow -- within the text.  The feature should be on a lineQ3280by itself and not contain any other text to be printed.  The formats are as3300follows:]3320>10,603340 H3360[LINE NUMBER, RIGHT ARROW, LEFT COLUMN NUMBER, COMMA, RIGHT COLUMNO3380NUMBER, CARRIAGE RETURN -- set the left and right margins from this pointH3400on.  The right margin should not be greater than the line length.]	3420>153440 G3460[LINE NUMBER, RIGHT ARROW, LEFT COLUMN NUMBER, CARRIAGE RETURN --I3480set the left margin only and leave the right margin set to the line3500length.]
3520>,553540 O3560[LINE NUMBER, RIGHT ARROW, COMMA, RIGHT COLUMN NUMBER, CARRIAGE RETURN --F3580set the right margin and leave the left margin set to column 1.]3600>3620 M3640[LINE NUMBER, RIGHT ARROW, CARRIAGE RETURN -- reset the margins back to?3660their original position of column 1 and the line length.]3680\G3700    [Many of the commands will be the same every time you print aG3720particular file and it is inconvenient to reenter them each time.I3740To make this process more automatic,  the following commands may beE3760entered in the text file preceded by a #: LINE, OFFSET, MARGIN,93780JUSTIFY, TITLE, TABSET, PAGE, PNUM, UNIT, and NULL.G3800These commands must be the first lines in the file.  In addition,N3820SPACE, COMMENT, and CHAIN may occur within the text but are not required,3840to be in the first lines of the file.]=3860    [These features are only recognized under the PRINTE3880command.  After typing in the command PRINT, be sure the paper 93900is positioned before entering the carriage return.]R3920    [NOTE: SECRETARY does not edit the input text  for printable characters.M3940Nonprintable and control characters (such as bell, delete, EOD) will beL3960accepted and placed in the data area.  When the data area is listed orO3980printed, the characters may ring the bell, clear the screen etc dependingJ4000on the character.  When justifying a line containing a nonprintable Q4020character, SECRETARY will think the line is justified, but the printed line04040may not actually end in the right margin.]4060\4080<MESSAGES4100  4120BASIC FILE DELETEDE4140    The MERGE command without a file name was entered to remove@4160    the BASIC data file from being inserted into the text.4180BASIC FILE ALREADY EXISTSG4200    The MERGE command was already used once to set up a data fileI4220    for insertion into the text.
