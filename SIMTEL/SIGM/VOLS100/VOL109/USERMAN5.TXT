#0010#title CP/M SECRTARY ADDENDUM/1000<CP/M SECRTARY WORD PROCESSOR DIFFERENCES1020 H1040[The following differences occur between the North Star version ofJ1060SECRTARY and the CP/M version of SECRTARY.  CP/M is the trademark ofE1080Digital Research.  SECRTARY is not a Digital Research product.]1100 K11201) To execute under CP/M, enter SECRTARY, not GO SECRTARY as required1140   for North Star DOS.1160 E11802) The CONFIGURE question about disk density will not be asked.1200 I12203) The amount of memory will be determined by CP/M so that question1240   will not be asked.1260 M12804) CP/M SECRTARY does not have automatic self-saving capability.  AfterK1300   you have run the CONFIGURE command or respond "Y" to the configureL1320   question, SECRTARY will not save a copy of itself on disk.  To saveL1340   a copy with all the specific options determined in CONFIGURE, enter<1360   QUIT to return to CP/M, then enter the CP/M command#1380         SAVE 40 SECRTARY.COM1400 L14205) The CALL and EXPAND commands have not been implemented.  EXPAND was;1440   not needed since the CP/M version is much smaller.1460 1480 L1500   Because CP/M users may be familiar with terms that North Star usersK1520   would not be familiar with, and some common North Star terms wouldF1540   be unfamiliar to CP/M users, a few commands have been changed1560   slightly.1580 1600 G16206) The UNIT command has been changed to DEVICE.  The parameter isB1640   either L for the list device or C for the console device.1660   EXAMPLE:  DEVICE L1680             DEVICE C1700 A17207) To delete a file from the disk, you can enter DESTROY as11740   documented, or ERA as you do under CP/M.1760 C17808) To list the disk directory, enter only the three characterH1800   DIR as you do under CP/M.  With no parameters, it will list the?1820   default disk device.  Otherwise enter the disk letter.1840   EXAMPLE:   DIR B:1860  J18809) To allow the use of ERA and DIR, all of the commands require onlyH1900   three characters instead of the four as documented earlier.  ToI1920   avoid confusion between CHAin and CHAll (change all), the change.1940   all command has been changed to CHLL.1960\C198010) The file naming conventions are same as used with CP/M ie12000      disk letter : 8 char name . file type;2020    The file type will default to TXT if not entered.!2040   EXAMPLE: LOAD B:DEMOFILE#2060            SAVE SAMPLTTR.TXT&2080            BSAVE C:BASICPGM.BAS2100  I212011) The NSAVE and SAVE commands do the exact same function.  If theG2140   file already exists, it will be renamed with the file type BAKJ2160   for backup.  If a backup file already exists, this earlier backupI2180   will be deleted.  Then the file will be copied to disk under the52200   name entered.  The default type will be TXT.#2220   EXAMPLE: SAVE B:SAMPLE.TXT2240 G226012) BLOAD takes a file in CP/M standard format and converts it itG2280   SECRTARY format; (optional line number) text, carriage return,H2300   line feed to character count, four character ASCII line number,E2320   text, carriage return.  The program will ask if the optionalF2340   line number already exists in the source program.  If it does@2360   exist, enter "Y" so SECRTARY will not generate new lineE2380   numbers, otherwise enter "N".  The line numbers must be four*2400   characters between 0000 and 9999.2420 F244013) BSAVE converts a SECRTARY file to standard CP/M format.  TheG2460   program will ask if you want the line numbers retained.  EnterG2480   "Y" if you want them retained or "N" if you want them stripped-2500   off the record before it is written.2520 I254014) If you exit to CP/M and want to return to SECRTARY and continueD2560   working with the existing file in memory, use the followingG2580   restart procedure.  Theis may happen if you wanted to rename aH2600   file, for instance.  Enter QUIT to leave SECRTARY and return toC2620   CP/M, enter REN or any other command, then enter the dummyE2640   command RESTART.  This will return you to SECRTARY, but willG2660   initialize the data area.  To restore the data area, enter theI2680   command RECOVER.  If you use a command that destroys part of theI2700   TPA such as STAT, this may not work.  If only part of the TPA isF2720   destroyed, enter SECRTARY to CP/M to bring in a fresh copy ofJ2740   SECRTARY, then try entering RECOVER to salvage the file in memory(2760   if it has not been overwritten.2780 M280015) SECRTARY does not use the CP/M read buffer routine, but does directH2820   I/O from the console to properly implement EDIT, control-C etc.K2840   Consequently, the backspace character must be defined to SECRTARY,M2860   control-C returns to SECRTARY not CP/M, and other control charactersA2880   such as control-P do not function as they do under CP/M.2900 M292016) The MERGE command is under development and has not been implementedD2940   with release 9.4.  It will be available in the near future.3000\3010<NEW ERROR MESSAGES&3020FOR CP/M VERSION, USE DEVICE L/CH3030    Do not use the UNIT command with the CP/M version of SECRTARY.I3040    Use the DEVICE command with L for the list device and C for the3050    console device.3060BAD CLOSE -- NOT SAVED/3070    The disk directory was probably full.3080DISK FULL -- NOT SAVEDH3090    There was not enough room on the disk to hold the entire file.3100CANNOT RENAME BACKUPG3110    An invalid return code was received from CP/M while trying to73120    rename the destination file to a backup name. 3130EXPECTED LINE FEED MISSINGD3140    the line feed character at the end of input lines during aF3150    BLOAD command was missing.
