It=1120uses sutstitute words that programmers call PARAMETERS.;1140The parameters are &not& to be taken literally.  They?1160should be replaced by real values and words that apply to<1180the work that you are doing.  Each paragraph explaines:1200what kinds of parameters the command is expecting.)]1220 1240  -1260APPEND FILENAME(,OPTIONAL DRIVE NUMBER)1280>5@1300[This command will load a file named "FILENAME" from disk.:1320The optional disk drive number is used when the file11340resides on a disk drive other than drive 1.51360The FREE command will automatically be executedD1380to show the amount of storage used.  The file will be APPENDedA1400to the end of the current file in memory.  The line numbers=1420of the APPENDed file do not have to follow those of the<1440existing file, but a RENUMBER will have to be done to %1460edit the file correctly later.]1480>#1500AUTO LN1(,OPTIONAL INCREMENT)1520>5@1540[Automatic line numbers will be generated until a carriage)1560return is entered without any text.>1580LN1 is the starting line number.  The increment for eachC1600succeeding line is optional and will default to 5 if missing.?1620Caution! If it generates a line number for a line already?1640in the file, the line in the file will be replaced.  This=1660command is terminated when no text is added to the line;1680and a null line is entered, or control-C is entered.]1700>1720BLOAD BASIC-PROGRAM-NAME1740>5B1760[This command will load a North Star BASIC program from diskK1780while converting it to SECRETARY format and place it in the data areaN1800to be edited with SECRETARY.  The line numbers in the program should not1820exceed 9999.]1840>1860BSAVE BASIC-PROGRAM-NAME1880>5N1900[This command will take a SECRETARY formatted file in memory, convert itM1920to North Star BASIC format, and write it to disk in BASIC-PROGRAM-NAME.P1940Be sure that the disk file is already created, it is a type 2 file, and itM1960is large enough to hold any changes that you may have added.  Since theN1980conversion requires scanning a large token table, the program may take a-2000minute or two to perform this command.]2020>2040\2060CALL ADDR1 HEX12080>5F2100[This command will allow the user to process a print line duringH2120PRINT command execution before it is passed to the output routine.%2140This command could be used for A2160justifying for special printers such as QUME.  ADDR1 is theK2180hexidecimal address of the user's routine which will be CALLed.  HEX1K2200is the hexidecimal value, which if it appears in the line, will causeH2220the user's routine to be executed.  If all lines are to be passed,J2240HEX1 should be 0D.  If no lines are to be passed, HEX1 should be 00.H2260When the user's routine is called, HL contains the address of the A2280print line buffer.  The line ends with 0D.  When the user'sK2300routine returns, DE should contain the address of the new print line.E2320Registers B, C, and A need not be saved.  A sample test routine.2340is contained within SECRETARY at 2D33H.]2360>2380CHAIN FILENAME2400>5G2420[This command will load and automatically begin printing the fileG2440named FILENAME.  It is useful to imbed this command at the end ofQ2460a data file to load and print files continuously as if they were one file.]2480>2500CHNG TEXT1^TEXT2	2520>5,32540[This command will scan the data area for theD2560string TEXT1, replace it with the string TEXT2, print the lineE2580and wait for a reply.  The only replies accepted are a carriage@2600return to accept the changed line and replace that line in=2620the file, control-A to not replace the changed line, orB2640control-C to cancel the command.  The  up-arrow is required,B2660but if no data follows the arrow, optional TEXT2, the string>2680TEXT1 will be deleted.  The entire file will be scanned @2700for all occurrences of the string TEXT1.  TEXT1 should not2720be a substring of TEXT2.]2740>2760CHALL TEXT1^TEXT22780>5B2800[This command will replace TEXT1 with TEXT2 similar to CHNG,H2820but will not print the line and wait for a reply.  All occurrences:2840of TEXT1 will be changed automatically in the file.]2860>2880CONFIGURE 	2900>5,F2920[This command initiates the series of questions which customizesF2940the program for your system.
