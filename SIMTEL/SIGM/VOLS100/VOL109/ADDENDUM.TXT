1000#JUST ON1040#PAGE 66,58,71060#PNUM 2511080#SPACE 1 1090#title Secretary Addendums1100<RELEASE 8.1 ADDENDUM1120 11401)INTEGRITY CHECKL1160[When SECRETARY is loaded, the first thing it does is check itself forN1180certain errors.  It will detect an error in writing the program to disk,O1200reading the program from disk, and certain memory errors.  If an error isR1220found, the message "INTEGRITY FAILURE" will be printed.  You should then tryI1240reloading or recopying it.  The original diskette is checked before1260shipping.]1280 13002)NEW CONFIGURE QUESTIONP1320[Since some printers cannot do a carriage return without doing a line feedP1340and other printers cannot backspace, the underline function may not alwaysN1360work properly.  To fix this, the following question will be asked during!1380the configuration command:]&1400<UNDERLINE USING BS OR CR (B/C)?M1420[If you printer does not backspace, enter "C" and it will do a carriageO1440return without doing a line feed.  If your printer does not do a carriageK1460return without a line feed, enter "B" and it will underline using the1480backspace character.]1500 15203)AUTO COMMAND CHANGESN1540[To cancel a line without stopping the generation of line numbers, enter'1560control-A rather than control-C.]1580  16004)COMMAND LINE RANGE CHECKM1620[On those commands which require a range of line numbers (such as DELT,O1640COPY, LIST, etc), if the first line number is greater than the second, an-1660"INVALID PARM1" error will be printed.]1680 17005)EDIT CONTROL-NM1720[Control-N will now cause the &new& line to be reedited rather than theR1740old line.  You can enter control-G to list the line then control-N to reedit,1760the line without entering EDIT again.]1780 "18006)Control-C during DIRECTORYP1820[If you type control-C while listing the directory, you will now return toJ1840SECRTARY rather than DOS.  This causes SECRETARY to make a temporary;1860modification to DOS for the duration of the command.]1880 (19007)PRINT BEGINNING AT A LINE NUMBERH1920[If you enter the command PRINT followed by a line number (similar=1940to the LIST command), printing will begin at that line.O1960CAUTION: If you have imbedded commands at the beginning of the file, theyN1980will be ignored unless they occur after the line number that you enter.]2000 2020\2040<NEW COMMANDS2060 20808) DESTROY filenameO2100[This command is similar the the North Star BASIC command.  It will eraseG2120the file name from the disk directory thereby deleting the file.]2140 21609) CHAIN filenameP2180[This command will do a LOAD and an automatic PRINT.  Be sure the paper isQ2200positioned before entering a carriage return.  This command may be imbeddedH2220within you text file to load and print multiple files at one time.O2240Printing will begin on the next line so if you want the new file to beginO2260on a new page, have a page eject character (back slash) at the top of theQ2280chained file.  The COMMENT and SPACE commands, in addition to CHAIN, may beL2300imbedded within the file rather than only at the beginning of the file2320as the other commands.]2340 "236010) BLOAD basic-program-nameQ2380[A BASIC program is not in the format that can be processed with SECRETARY.Q2400To load a BASIC program and convert it to SECRETARY format in memory, enterQ2420BLOAD followed by the name of the BASIC program file.  You can then use theP2440editing features of SECRETARY on it.  NOTE: Renumber only changes the lineK2460numbers at the left side of the line and not references to those lineM2480numbers within a line (such as GOTO, GOSUB, etc) as the BASIC REN does.O2500Use the CHNG command to change these references.  The line numbers in theO2520BASIC program must not exceed 9999 so you may have to do a BASIC renumber 2540before BLOADing the file.]2560 "258011) BSAVE basic-program-nameM2600[This is the opposite of BLOAD.  It takes a SECRETARY formatted file inG2620memory, converts it to North Star BASIC, and writes it to disk inO2640basic-program-name.  Be sure that the disk file is already created, it isM2660type 2, and it is large enough to include any changes that you may haveK2680added to the program.  Since the conversion requires scanning a largeQ2700token table, the program may take a minute or two to perform this command.]2720 274012) EXPANDP2760[These new features require an additional 1.5K of memory.  This means thatL2780text files that could be loaded before under an earlier release may beJ2800too large to load now.  To solve this problem, the BLOAD, BSAVE, andP2820CONFIGURE commands have been put at the end of SECRETARY.  By entering theO2840command EXPAND, you wan wipe out these three commands and expand the dataP2860area by about 2K so those large files will now fit.  &CAUTION: do not saveN2880a copy of the program after entering EXPAND or you will permanently loseP2900the BSAVE, BLOAD, and CONFIGURE commands.  BE SURE TO SAVE ANY TEXT IN THEQ2920DATA AREA BEFORE ENTERING EXPAND.  ANY TEXT IN THE DATA AREA AFTER ENTERING)2940EXPAND WILL BE PERMANENTLY LOST.& ]2960\2980<RELEASE 9.3 ADDENDUM3000  %30201) UNIT RESET ON LIST AND PRINT	3040>5,F3060[After listing or printing on a device other than zero (UNIT 0),A3080the print and list device will revert back to the console.]3100>3120 A31402) THE CHNG COMMAND WILL ACCEPT SPACE IN ADDITION TO CNTL-A3160   TO REJECT A CHANGE.3180 D32003) THE FIND COMMAND WILL PRINT ON THE DEVICE SPECIFIED BY UNIT	3220>5,E3240[With the extensive use of Secretary to edit BASIC programs, itG3260may be desirable to get a cross-reference on hard copy using theF3280FIND command.  For this reason, the lines printed by FIND may goC3300to the printer specified by UNIT.  It will not revert back toE3320unit zero (console) in case there are multiple cross-references3340to be printed.]3360>3380 34004) BOOT COMMAND	3420>5,J3440[The BOOT command was included in release 9, but was not documented.G3460BOOT will jump to E800 or E900 (depending on the disk density) toJ3480reboot DOS.  If you have DOS set to automatically bring up BASIC andL3500and a menu program, you can bring it up without going to DOS directly.F3520Using the BASIC program "LOADER" on the disk, you can even go to13540Secretary from BASIC without going to DOS.]3560>3580 %36005) THE BSAVE BUG HAS BEEN FIXED3620 '36406) THE DATA AREA BEGINS AT 60E0H.3660 !3700<ADDENDUM 9.4 (MAY 1, 1980)3720  G37401) The imbedded TITLE bug (converting all characters to caps) has3760   been fixed.3780 G38002) The tab/edit bug (losing tabs on edited lines) has been fixed.3820 *38403) The control-A bug has been fixed.3860 J38804) The bug that permitted file names to be greater than 8 charactersD3900   has been fixed.  If a file name is entered with more than 823920   characters, INVALID PARM will be printed.3940 I39605) It must be repeated that you cannot use CHNG or CHAL to change aG3980   string to a subset of itself or a string preceeded by a space.D4000   To change X to XY, first change X to something obscure likeL4020   #$%  then change #$% to XY.  This is because of the way the programM4040   rescans the line after making a change to find additional occurencesH4060   within the same line.  To change a string preceeded by a blank,J4080   change the string to include a character before a blank or better4100   still, use EDIT.4200#CHAIN ADDEND2
