YOUNG, INC1010#PNUM 1"1020#TITLE SECRETARY USER MANUAL1030\D1040[This discussion teaches you to use the functions of SECRETARYD1050using specific examples.  For a generalized description of the 1060commands, see Section II.]1070 1080 ,1090<SECTION I -- HOW TO USE THE SECRETARY1100 1110PART 1.    STARTING UP1120 "1130A) BACKING UP FOR PROTECTION=1140[The diskette you have is in single density format, but=1150because the origin is at 2D00, it will work on either aD1160single or double density system.  The first thing to do, if it91170has not already been done, is to copy the diskette.61180Then save the original diskette and use the copy1190for all runs.]1200 	1210\151220B) EXECUTING SECRETARYG1230[After you have generated a backup copy of the disk, load it intoG1240drive 1 and next to the asterisk or plus sign typed by DOS, type]1250<GO SECRTARY;1260[SECRETARY will load and execute.  It will then type]$1270     USED: 0  AVAILABLE: 346841280     #'1290[This tells you that SECRETARY is)1300capable of holding 34684 characters71310in its memory.  The biggest data file it can hold21320is 34684 divided by 256 or about 135 blocks.:1330The pound sign # indicates that SECRETARY is waiting*1340for you to enter a command or data.]1350 	1360\15"1370C) ENTERING COMMANDS OR DATA?1380[The commands will be discussed in detail later, but onlyC1390the first four characters of each command are necessary to beD1400typed.  These four characters may be entered in upper or lower@1410case.  If you type an invalid command, a list of the valid51420four-letter commands will be printed.  The dataI1430is always preceded by a line number.  This line number can be from >1440one to four digits (allowing for 9999 lines.)  A line isK1450terminated by a carriage return.  The input lines cannot be more than1460136 characters long.M1470If you want SECRETARY to ignore a line so that you can retype it, enterO1480control-C.  The line will be erased and the # sign will appear indicatingD1490it is ready for a new command or data line.  The backspace keyQ1500can be used to backspace on the line before the carriage return is entered.J1510SECRETARY will ring the bell once seven characters before the end ofJ1520the line and once for each character that will not fit on the line.]1530\7-1540D) RECONFIGURING  FOR YOUR INSTALLATIONL1550[SECRETARY is shipped with memory set at 36K, the backspace key is theC1560backspace character, a CRT is not used, the printer prints onE1570continuous forms paper, line wrap around is enabled, input lineK1580length is set for 64 characters, and the disk is single density only.-1590If all of these apply to your system orG1600if SECRETARY has already been reconfigured for your installation,I1610go to Part 2.  The first time the program is used it will print the1620question]1630<CONFIGURE (Y/N)?R1640[SECRETARY is giving you the opportunity to customize it for your particularP1650system.  If you enter N, you can still use the program immediately, but itL1660will be set for the default system.  If you enter Y, it will ask you a&1670series of questions as follows:]1680 %1690<MEMORY IN K STARTING AT 2000H?S1700[If you have 40K of memory starting at 2000H, enter 40 and a carriage return.M1710If you have 40K but it starts at 0000H, then you only have 32K starting21720at 2000H so enter 32 and a carriage return.]1730 #1740<TYPE CHAR USED FOR BACKSPACEG1750[You may choose to  use the backspace key, underscore, control-H,P1760rubout, del, or any other character for the backspace character.  WhateverK1770character you want to use, type that character (no carriage return is1780needed).]1790 &1800<SINGLE OR DOUBLE DENSITY (S/D)?C1810[If you have a single density system, enter S (no CR needed).;1820If you have a double or quad density system, enter D.?1830If you enter an invalid character to this or any of theseB1840questions that expect a certain character, the question will1850be reprinted.]1860 &1870<STOP AT END OF EACH PAGE (Y/N)?M1880[If your printer prints only one page at a time and you want to stop atC1890the bottom of each page and wait for a carriage return beforeA1900continuing, enter Y.  Otherwise enter N.  Most printers use61910continuous forms so normally you would enter N.]1920  1930<LINES PER SCREEN OR ZERO?R1940[If you are using a 16 line CRT, enter 16 and a carriage return.  If you are:1950using a 24 line CRT, enter 24 and a carriage return.$1960The LIST or PRINT command willR1970display that many lines and wait for a carriage return before displaying theQ1980next group of lines.  If you do not want this pause or if you do not have a?1990CRT, enter 0 carriage return.  This pause will only occur.2000if the output is directed to unit zero.]2010\2020<INPUT LINE LENGTH?82030[If you are using a CRT with a maximum width of 64E2040characters, enter 64 and a carriage return.  The maximum length>2050is 136 characters.  It is a good idea to make your lines<2060shorter than necessary.  That way if you edit the line;2070later and insert a word, the character count will not<2080exceed the 136 character maximum or your screen size.]2090 '2100<LINE WRAP AROUND ON INPUT (Y/N)?N2110[When you are entering data using the automatic line number feature, theR2120program will check for the end of the line.  When you enter a character thatP2130will not fit on the line, it backs up to the last blank, adds that portionO2140of the line to the file, prints a new line number, and copies the portionM2150of the line from the blank through your last keystroke to the new line.12160You never have to enter a carriage return.])2170    [If you are adding lines to theO2180beginning of the file, it may take a moment to move the rest of the linesJ2190down to insert the new line.  If you are also using a slow terminal 2200(10 to 30O2210characters per second) and you are a fast typist, the delay for insertionQ2220and typing the line number and characters may be too long so you may lose aK2230character or two.  In this case you should enter N to this question. N2240Otherwise enter Y.  In either case, the bell will sound seven characters
2250fromP2260the end of the line and you can terminate the line with a carriage return.P2270If you enter N, however, any characters that will not fit on the line will2280echo as a bell sound.]2290 &2300<UNDERLINE USING BS OR CR (B/C)?O2310[If your printer cannot backspace, enter "C" and SECRETARY will underlineM2320using a carriage return without a line feed.  If your printer cannot doJ2330a carriage return without doing a line feed, enter "B" and SECRETARY42340will underline using the backspace character.]2350 2360 ,2370<SAVE THIS VERSION OF SECRETARY (Y/N)?02380[If you type Y, the program will then ask]"2390<DO YOU HAVE A BACKUP (Y/N)?K2400[If you answer N, it will exit to DOS to allow you to backup.  If youN2410answer Y, it will copy itself back to disk on drive 1 and the "CONFIGUREK2420(Y/N)?" message will not occur again.  If you decide not to save thisM2430version, the responses that you entered will only be in effect for this	2440runH2450and the configure question will appear next time you run.  You canO2460reconfigure at any time in the future, even if you did save this version,2470byK2480entering the command CONFIGURE.  All of these questions will again be2490asked.]2500\'2510PART 2.  SIMPLE FILE MANIPULATION2520 2530A) EXECUTING SECRETARY82540[When DOS prints the asterisk or plus sign, enter]2550<GO SECRTARY2560 2570B) THE LOAD COMMANDC2580[First, load an existing file off of the original diskette toI2590see what a text file looks like.  Use the demonstration file on the12600disk for an example.  Next to the #, enter]2610<LOAD DEMOFILED2620    [If you do not have enough memory to load the entire file,E2630the message "FILE TOO LARGE" will be printed.  The program willE2640load as much of the file as it can.  You must enter the command52650RECOVER to salvage the data before continuing.]2660 2670C) THE LIST COMMAND72680[Now that you have loaded the demonstration file,/2690you can list the file simply by entering]2700<LISTC2710[You can stop the listing any time by entering control-C.  ToJ2720begin listing from  the line 1200 rather than the first line, enter]2730<LIST 120012740To list lines 1200 through 2000 only, enter2750<LIST 1200,20002760 %2770D) INSERTING OR REPLACING LINES>2780[To insert or replace a line, just enter the line number;2790followed by the text.  You do not have to precede the 2800number by leading zeroes.]+2810<1030#comment this replaces line 10302820 2830E) DELETING LINESD2840[To delete a line or group of lines, enter the line number andB2850a carriage return without any data or use the delete command2860as follows:]2870     1002880     DELT 100?2890     DELT 100,200          (delete lines 100 through 200)2900     DELETE 1002910     DELETE 100,2002920  2930F) BLANK LINES?2940[To insert blank lines, enter the line number followed by42950one or two spaces before the carriage return.]2960\2970G) ADDITIONAL PRINTERSD2980[If you have a printer in addition to a CRT and the printer isE2990used in BASIC  by saying PRINT #1,... the printer is on unit 1.O3000You can have the listing come out on that printer rather than the CRT by 3010entering]3020<UNIT 1R3030[Then use the LIST or PRINT command.  To return the listing back to the CRT,3040enter]3050<UNIT 03055 &3060H) CHECKING THE SIZE OF THE DATAA3070[To find out how much space has been used in memory, enter]3080<FREE?3090[The message USED: AAAA AVAILABLE: BBBBB  LAST LINE: CCCC83100BLOCKS: DDD will print where AAAA is the number of?3110characters in memory used already, BBBBB is the number of@3120characters available for use, CCCC is the last line number@3130in the file, and DDD is the number of disk blocks required3140to hold the text so far.]3150 $3160I) THE SAVE AND NSAVE COMMANDSF3170[To save the modified file back on to disk under a new name when23180this new file does not already exist, enter]3190<NSAVE NEWMAN1D3200[If you have already saved this file once and you want to save13210the current data over this old data, enter]3220<SAVE NEWMAN1G3230[Of course NEWMAN1 is a name used for an example, you can use anyH3240name of eight characters or less.  If the diskette was initializedJ3250in double density, the file will be saved in double density.  If theH3260diskette was initialized in single density, the file will be saved3270in single density.=3280If you get the message "DISK FULL ERROR", it means that=3290there was not enough room on the disk to fit the entire?3300file.  Insert a new disk and NSAVE the program on another>3310initialized disk.  Later you should delete the file from+3320from the disk where it would not fit.@3330For the sake of backup, it is a good practice to use NSAVEC3340each time you save a text file, and use a diskette other than*3350the one containing the source text.]3360 3370J) THE QUIT COMMAND;3380[To exit the program and return to DOS, simply enter]3390<QUIT3400 3410K) THE HELP COMMAND&3420[If you forget a command, enter]3430<HELPB3440[A list of the first four characters of each command will be>3450printed.  This list will also be printed if you enter an3460invalid command.]3470 R3480[By now, then, you have listed all of DEMOFILE.  If not, go to PART 2 step BO3490load the file again, and list it.  Save this listing as an example of the(3500techniques to be discussed later.]3510\$3520PART 3. CREATING YOUR OWN FILE3530 3540A) THE SCRATCH COMMANDL3550[When you load a file,  the previous file in memory (if there was one)H3560will be destroyed.  When you save a file, memory is not destroyed.>3570If you do not remove the file in memory before beginningG3580a new file, the lines that you enter will be merged into the fileD3590already in memory.  To remove a file from memory and reset all13600values (reinitialize the data area), enter]3610<SCRATCHO3620[SECRETARY will then reprint the FREE message to let you know that it has3630been initialized.]3640 3650B) ENTERING DATA=3660[Data can be entered by typing the line number followedL3670immediately by the text.  The line numbers may, but do not have to be,"3680preceded by leading zeroes.]3690     100This is line 100$3700     0100This is also line 10033710     9999THIS IS THE MAXIMUM LINE NUMBER USED3720 (3730C) AUTOMATIC LINE NUMBER PROMPTING:3740[To make entering data easier, SECRETARY will prompt<3750you with the line number so you only need to enter theE3760text.  To prompt starting with line number 100 and incrementing3770each line by 10, enter]3780<AUTO 100,10B3790[To terminate the automatic prompting of line numbers, enter<3800a carriage return without any data or enter control-C.P3810To cancel an entire line without stopping automatic line generation, enter3820control-A.M3830When you are entering data using the automatic line number feature, theM3840program will check for the end of the line.  When you enter a characterM3850that will not fit on the line, it backs up to the last blank, adds thatO3860portion of the line to the file, prints a new line number, and copies theP3870portion of the line from the blank through your last key stroke to the newQ3880line.  You never have to enter a carriage return.  CAUTION, however, if youQ3890are a fast typist and you are using a slow terminal, it is possible to lose3900a character or two.]3910 .3920D) ADDING, REPLACING, AND DELETING LINESE3930[Additional lines may be added or inserted by entering the lineM3940number followed by the text.  Lines may be deleted by entering the lineC3950number without any text or using the DELETE or DELT commands.B3960 If the data area cannot hold any more lines, SECRETARY willA3970print the error message "FILE FULL ERROR".  Blank lines may>3980be inserted by entering the line number and one  space.]3990\*4000E) LINE FILL AND JUSTIFICATION LATERP4010[If a group of lines are to be justified later, enclose the group of linesG4020in brackets.  See the listing of DEMOFILE for an example of this.N4030If the lines run together improperly, check to see if you left the right64040or left bracket off of the preceding paragraph.]4050 4060F) PAGE EJECTIONK4070[To eject to a new page when printing, use the backslash on a line byC4080itself.  See the listing of DEMOFILE for an example of this.]4090<1000I4100[Sometimes it may be necessary to do a conditional page eject.  ForQ4110instance, you may want the next 4 lines to fit on the same page and if theyP4120will not, then you want to do a page eject.  This is done by following theN4130backslash immediately by the number of lines that must fit on the page.]4140<1000 44150 4160G) CENTERINGK4170[To cause a line to be centered, precede the line of text with a leftD4180arrow.  Be sure the length of the line to be centered is never>4190longer than the length of the line to be printed later.]&4200 1010 THIS LINE WILL BE CENTERED!4210<THIS LINE WILL BE CENTERED4220 4230H) TABSH4240[To use the tab function, just enter the tab key as you would on aA4250typewriter.  The tab will echo as a @ when input or listed.4260The tabK4270expansion will be done during the PRINT command if the TABSET commandO4280was used (will be discussed later).  Do not use tabs within the line fill74290brackets since justification may add extra spaces44300and change the tab positions. If your terminal.4310does not have a tab key, try control-I.]4320 (4330I) INDENTING INDIVIDUAL PARAGRAPHSL4340[Paragraphs may be indented from the rest of the text by preceding theF4350lines to be indented with a right arrow and margins as follows:]4360>10,504370 H4380[LINE NUMBER, RIGHT ARROW, LEFT COLUMN NUMBER, COMMA, RIGHT COLUMNO4390NUMBER, CARRIAGE RETURN -- set the left and right margins from this pointH4400on.  The right margin should not be greater than the line length.]	4410>154420 G4430[LINE NUMBER, RIGHT ARROW, LEFT COLUMN NUMBER, CARRIAGE RETURN --I4440set the left margin only and leave the right margin set to the line4450length.]
4460>,554470 O4480[LINE NUMBER, RIGHT ARROW, COMMA, RIGHT COLUMN NUMBER, CARRIAGE RETURN --F4490set the right margin and leave the left margin set to column 1.]4500>4510 M4520[LINE NUMBER, RIGHT ARROW, CARRIAGE RETURN -- reset the margins back to?4530their original position of column 1 and the line length.]4540 4550J) &UNDERLINING&E4560[You can indicate to SECRETARY to underline a word by preceding54570and following the word or phrase with a & sign.(4580It will not underline a blank.  IfE4590you want to use the & in your text, just be sure it is precededL4600and followed by a blank.  When a nonblank character is found following=4610a & sign, the underline switch is turned on so that all?4620nonblank characters are underlined.  When it encounters a=4630 & sign followed by a blank, it turns off the underlineA4640switch so that the following characters are not underlined.?4650If the & is at the end of a line and followed by a period=4660or comma, the underline switch will still be turned on.;4670If you want a & to print, be sure it is not the firstA4680character on a line since the preceding character would not>4690be a blank but rather a line number.  Underlining occurs54700only during the execution of the PRINT command.:4710Be sure that your printer has an underline character!4720(ASR 33 terminals do not).]4730 4740K) DIRECTORYD4750[If you want to print the directory of a disk to see if a file4760already exists, enter]4770<DIRECTORYI4780[The directory of the disk in drive 1 will be printed.  To list the"4790directory on drive 2, enter]4800<DIRECTORY 24810  4820L) MORE ON SAVE AND NSAVER4830[While entering new text, it is a good idea to periodically save the file onM4840disk in case of system failure.  Someone may trip on the power cord, or)4850your best friend may enter SCRATCH.A4860For example, you estimate that your file will be 80 blocks.G4870If you had a 32K system, the maximum file could only be 80 blocksP4880and you will want to leave some room for expansion later.  Assume that youQ4890have only entered 20 blocks so far and the file does not exist on disk yet.4900 Enter]4910<NSAVE MYFILE 80D4920[This will create a file of 80 blocks even though you are onlyF4930using 20 blocks right now.  The file type will be set to type 7.E4940If there was not enough room on the disk to hold all 80 blocks,D4950SECRETARY would type "DISK FULL ERROR" and ring the bell.  You4960should then put inB4970another disk and do the NSAVE again.  If you get the message>4980"FILE TOO SMALL", see PART 7 PARAGRAPH C.  If you wanted4990your file to be5000on drive 2, enter]5010<NSAVE MYFILE,2 80K5020[After the file has been created once, you can save over that copy by5030entering]5040<SAVE MYFILE5050\5060M) THE APPEND COMMANDP5070[The text in your file may contain some frequently used paragraphs.  These75080paragraphs can be kept on disk in a separate fileD5090and appended to your text when needed.  Assume you have a fileI5100of frequently used text called FREQUSED.  You can append it to your5110file by entering]5120<APPEND FREQUSEDL5130[The line numbers are probably not in sequence any more because of theH5140appended data, so you MUST renumber the file before doing any more5150editing of the data.;5160See the MOVE command explanation to understand how to?5170move the FREQUSED text to the middle of your current text'5180file after it has been appended.]5190 5200N) THE RENUMBER COMMANDK5210[To renumber a file starting with 1000 and incrementing by 20, enter]5220<RENUMBER 1000,20H5230[If the file is too big and using this starting value or incrementI5240would cause the last number to exceed 9999, SECRETARY will type theG5250message "RENUMBER VALUES TOO BIG".  If it does, just use RENUMBER85260again with a smaller starting value or increment.]5270 5280O) THE OPEN COMMAND@5290[The OPEN command is a way to put new text into the middle=5300of existing text where the lines are numbered too close5310together.N5320Sometimes it may be necessary to insert many lines between two lines i.eP5330insert 20 lines between 100 and 110.  You would wipe out lines 110 throughR5340120 if you just added the lines or used the command AUTO 101,1.  You need toN5350renumber lines 110 to the end of the data with a higher value.  In other>5360words, you need to open the line numbers after line 100.5370For example, you mayJ5380want to renumber the lines  starting with line 110, setting line 110O5390to 300, and incrementing each line after that by 10.  This could  be done5400by entering]5410<OPEN 110,300,10Q5420[The line numbers prior to 100 would not be renumbered.  Line numbers 110, K5430120... would be numbered 300, 310...  You can now safely use the AUTO*5440command to insert additional lines.]5450<AUTO 101,5N5460[It is recommended that after you have entered all of the new lines, you&5470renumber the entire file again.]5480 5490P) THE DESTROY COMMANDC5500[The DESTROY command is used to erase a file from the disk inG5510the same way the DESTROY command is used in BASIC.  To delete the5520file NOGOOD, enter]5530<DESTROY NOGOOD5540#CHAIN B:USERMAN2.TXT
