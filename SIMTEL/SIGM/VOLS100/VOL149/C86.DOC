Re:       8086 SMALL C
CC:       Bob White

Thanks to Bob M. White, here is the 8086 version of SMALL C which 
originally appeared in 8080 form in Dr. Dobbs.

8086  SMALL C will require a 128 KByte minimum CP/M-86 system for 
operation...but  will  compile  itself in 56  Kbytes  of  CP/M-80 
system!   To  recompile,  use C86<cr>,  answer "no" to include  C 
source,  say "yes" to compiling the entire program, answer output 
file  of  "C86N.A86",  and  then answer input  file  of  "C86N.C" 
(whew!)...have fun with this one.        - KS -

The files are currently on dsk B:
