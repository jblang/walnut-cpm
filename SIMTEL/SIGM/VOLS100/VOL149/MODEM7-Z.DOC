                        PROGRAM DOCUMENTATION


Terminal Mode  -  'T' Option

^Y      The terminal mode may be called with or without a file name.  If
        a  file  is  specified  (it should be a new file), then anything
        received by the modem may be saved in memory and  later  written
        on  disk.    The save feature is toggled ON/OFF by Control-Y.  A
        colon (:) will be printed at the beginning  of  each  line  when
        memory  save  is  active. The colon will not be transmitted over
        the modem nor will it be saved in memory.   If  a  file  is  not
        specified, then memory save can not be activated.
     
        If the memory buffer is full (the buffer is from the top of  the
        program  to  the bottom of BDOS), the contents are automatically
        written to disk (but the file is not yet closed). Communications
        may  then  continue  with the buffer reinitialized. The computer
        with which you are communicating must accept the X-ON and  X-OFF
        (Control-Q and Control-S) conventions or data will be lost.

^E      When communications are over, use Control-E  to  exit  from  the
WRT     Terminal  mode  and  enter  the Menu.  The file to which you are
RET     saving  must then be closed by using the 'WRT' command.  If this
        is  not  done,  all  data  will be lost.  The file is not closed
        automatically since there will be times when you leave  terminal
        mode and then decide to re-enter.  This may be done while in the
        Menu by using the 'RET' command.  You may re-enter Terminal mode
        and  save  in the same file as many times as you wish as long as
        you have not closed the file with the 'WRT' command.

^T      While in Terminal mode, Control-T will put you in File  Transfer
^X      mode.  This will allow you to send the contents of an ASCII file
        over the modem. This routine does no error  checking  and  there
        are   no  protocols  specified  between  this  program  and  the
        receiving computer other than that it should be ready to receive
        data via the modem.  Control-X will cancel the transfer.

Computer mode - 'E' Option

	This mode echos data received  from other  terminal.   Only  one
        computer  may  be  in  this  mode at one time.  There is no save
        feature in this mode. Useful if you  wish  to  communicate  with
        somebody running the terminal portion of the program.

File transfer - 'S' and 'R' Options

        These features are the same as in the CP/M Modem program written
        by Ward Christensen except that upon completion of the transfer,
        control returns to the Menu unless the secondary 'T' option  has
        been  selected.  In the latter case, control returns to Terminal
	mode.	 Note that these features are also the same as in CPS by
	SoftStuff.

Return to Menu - 'M' option

        When asked to select an option, 'M' returns to Menu.

The MENU

        If the Modem program is entered with  no  option,  the  Menu  is
        called.    The  Menu  gives the choice of selecting the standard
        options as defined by Ward Christensen (T, E,  R,  and  S).  The
        Terminal mode has been greatly expanded as described above.  The
        "R" and "S" commands must be called with a filename or you  will
        be  required  to  enter  the  primary  command  (S or R) and the
        filename again (but NOT the secondary options).

  RET - You may also enter terminal mode using the 'RET' command, but no
        data will be saved since a file may not be named with 'RET'. Use
        the 'RET' command to RE-ENTER Terminal mode after it  has  first
        been  entered  with  the  'T' option.  If this is done, you will
        still be able to save the communications if you  were  doing  so
	before you exitted the terminal mode and have not used the 'WRT'
	command.

  WRT - The 'WRT' command must be used after leaving Terminal mode. This
        writes  the last buffer to disk and closes the file.  Failure to
        use the 'WRT' command results in loss of all data and a file  of
        length zero.

  DEL - The 'DEL' command  erases  the  most  recent  file  accessed  in
        Terminal  mode.  Useful  if you decide after communications that
        you don't want to save information just gathered.

  CPM - The 'CPM' command reboots and returns to CP/M.

  XPR - The 'XPR' command is a  toggle  which  causes  the  menu  to  be
        printed  or  not  printed.   Initially the menu is on unless the
        program is called with the "X" option (ie. A>MODEM X ).

  DIR - The 'DIR' command lists the directory of a CP/M disk.   A  drive
        may  be  specified  (ie.  DIR  B:)  or the default drive will be
        listed.  After the directory is listed, the  menu  will  not  be
        printed whether XPR mode is on or off. If XPR mode is on and you
        wish to see the menu, hit return.

  ^B -  Control-B while in Terminal (or  Echo)  mode  allows  change  ofŠ        baudrate  "on-the-fly."  A  carriage  return gives 300 baud; all
        other rates (110-38400) must be explicitely stated.

        R - receive  a CP/M file (must specify file)
        T - terminal mode (specify file if memory save wanted)
