XMODEM.HQP     a VAX HELP file about the three programs.                                                                        CPM.CQM        a VAX command procedure file defining XMODEM,TOXMOD,FROMXMOD as                                                                      foreign commands.                                                                                           QIO.DCK        an INCLUDE file for XMODEM.FOR defining a COMMON area.                                                                                                                                                                                           The file format produced by XMODEM is 128 character fixed length records.                                                       These files may PRINT and TYPE reasonably, but to edit them on your VAX                                                         they must be converted to ordinary VAX text files by FROMXMOD.                                                                  If you forget which files have been converted by TOXMOD or FORMXMOD,                                                            just do a DIRECTORY/FULL to see the file format on the VAX.                                                                     Similarly XMODEM will only send text files reasonably if they have                                                              been converted to CP/M form by TOXMOD, otherwise the FORTRAN input statements                                                   in XMODEM will append lots of blanks to each line of text and no                                                                carriage returns will be sent.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  A version of MODEM7 for the VAX is also in the works.  Watch for it                                                             in the late spring of 1983.  XMODEM is also available from the                                                                  LOCKE COMPUTER CENTER at the UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON  for the PDP-10.                                                                                                                                                                                          If anyone hears of XMODEM or MODEM7 available for other MAINFRAMES                                                              especially Control Data CYBER or Digital Equipment Company PDP-10, PDP-11, VAX                                                  I would like to hear about them.
