.SH NAME
LAR \- CP/M lu compatible file archiver
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B lar
key library [ file ... ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Lar is a Unix program to manipulate CP/M LU format libraries.
The primary use of lar is to combine several
files together for upload/download to a personal computer.
Its actions are controlled by the
.I key\^
argument.
The
.I key\^
is a string of characters containing
at most one function letter and possibly
one or more function modifiers.
Other arguments to the command are
.I files\^
specifying which files are to be dumped or restored.
.PP
The function portion of
the key is specified by one of the following letters:
.PP
.PD 0
.TP 8
.B u
The named
.I files\^
are added to the library.
.TP
.B e
The named
.I files\^
are extracted from the tape.
.TP
.B p
Print files in library.
.TP
.B d
Delete files in library.
.TP
.B r
Reorganize library.
.TP
.B t
The names of the specified files are listed each time that they occur
on the library.
If no
.I files\^
argument is given,
all the names
on the tape are listed.
.PD
.PP
The following characters may be used in addition to the letter
that selects the desired function:
.PP
.PD 0
.TP 8
.TP
.B v
Normally,
.I Lar\^
does its work silently.
The
.B v
(verbose)
option causes it to type the name of each file it treats,
preceded by the function letter.
With the
.B t
function,
.B v
gives more information about the
library entries than just the name.
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
Invoking lar without arguments prints a help message.
.SH AUTHOR
The original CP/M library program LU is the product of Gary P. Novosielski.
Unix version by Stephen Hemminger,  Mitre Corp. Bedford MA.
.SH BUGS
Pathnames are stored in CP/M format (XXXXXXXX.XXX).
.br
Lar tries to detect
text files vs. binaries by checking for non-Ascii (8th bit set) chars.
If the file is text lar will throw away Control-Z chars which
CP/M puts on the end.
All files in the library are padded with Control-Z
up to the end to the CP/M sector size if necessary.
No effort is made to handle the difference between CP/M and Unix
end of line chars.
CP/M uses Cr/Lf and Unix just uses Lf.
