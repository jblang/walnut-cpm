                  INDEX is a utility for use with WordStar, and generates 
             an alphabetically sorted index for a file.  Words or phrases 
             to  be put in the indexed are marked with control characters 
             not used elswhere within WordStar.  (At least as of  version 
             1.01)  If a file is later edited,  invoking INDEX again will 
             remove the old index,  produce a new one,  and add it to the 
             end of the file.
             
                  INDEX can also be use with any non-WordStar text editor  
             that  can insert control characters into the text.  No other 
             assumptions are made about the contents of the file,  except 
             that  the  file  is  terminated  by  a  control-Z  character 
             (correct way) or end of file.

                  INDEX  scans  the text file for certain  WordStar  "dot 
             commands",  such as page breaks,  etc., in order to maintain 
             proper page numbers. If no page "dot" commands are found, as 
             with other editors, pages are counted internally.

                  There are two different kinds of index  entries;  WORDS 
             and  PHRASES.  WORDS  are  what are normally thought  of  as 
             words;  groups of characters,  seperated by  spaces,  commas 
             carriage  returns (called CR from now on) or linefeeds (LF). 
             PHRASES  are  groups of words,  including  the  spaces  that 
             seperate the words. 

                  Since  words are easy to find,  only a single marker is 
             necessary  to  identify them.  This marker  is  a  control-K 
             character,  ^K.  Phrases  must  have both ends  marked,  and 
             control-P is used, ^P. Below are some examples:

             The sixth word in this ^Ksentence will be put in the index.

             ^PThis entire phrase will be there^P, also.

                  Since this is page 2 of the manual, the index for these 
             should look like:

             Sentence...................................... 2
             This entire phrase............................ 2

                  These two examples are actually in the index at the end 
             of this manual.

             WordStar dot commands

                  INDEX is optimized for use with WordStar.  By  default, 
             it  scans  the  file for "dot  commands";  notably  .pa  and 
             "..index". .PA is used to count pages, and must be the first 
             word on the line to be counted as a dot command. 

                  The "..index" is created and used by INDEX.  As defined 
             in  the  WordStar manual,  any line beginning with two  dots 
             (..) will be ignored when printed.  INDEX uses this to  mark 
             the beginning of the index.  When INDEX is run,  if it finds 
             the  "..index" line,  it will remove all text following that 
             line. This allows creating an index for an updated file that 
             already has an index. If one was not found, it is added.

                  CAUTION: NEVER put a ".." WordStar dot command followed 
             by index,  as described above.  All text following this line 
             will  be deleted from the file.  A single space after the .. 
             will suffice, or use .IG instead.

             Sorting

                  As  stated  before,   the  index  generated  is  sorted 
             alphabetically.  The  entire  phrase  or  word  is  used  in 
             sorting,  except  that  case is ignored.  

                  If  identical entries are found,  they are listed on  a 
             single  line,   followed  by  all  page  numbers  found  on. 
             Unfortunately,  multiple  identical  page  numbers  will  be 
             listed.  For  clarity,  some  examples of  how  things  work 
             follows.

             The  following  two  phrases  are  equivalent,  as  case  is 
             ignored, and will be listed on one line. The first occurence 
             will be the entry on the left side of the page.

             This is the first phrase
             THIS IS THE FIRST PHrAsE

             Since length counts, these next are all in proper order.

             This

             Side effects and cautions

                  This is a list of implementation peculiarities, etc.

             -In general, any group of one or more white-space characters 
             (see  below)  are converted into a single  space  character. 
             Phrases  with  embedded spaces will have  all  extra  spaces 
             (more  than  one)  removed.  A phrase may start and  end  on 
             different  lines  (or even pages) and  will  work  properly. 
             Leading spaces will be removed from the index entry.

             -The  following characters are converted to and treated as a 
             single ASCII space character.  These also mark the end of  a 
             word:

                          CR LF tab comma (,) semicolon (;) 
                              colon (:) suprise-mark (!)
            
             -BUG  NOTICE Periods are removed from the character  stream. 
             This was a cheap way out since it is a  sentence-terminator. 
             The  only  time this is a problem is when putting things  in 
             the index such as filenames. (i.e., FILENAME.TYP) If someone 
             complains, it will probably get fixed.

             -Words and phrases will have any leading spaces removed. The 
             first  character of any word or phrase will be converted  to 
             upper  case.  Note  that  if a phrase consists of  a  single 
             blank,  it will NOT be removed from the index. This does not 
             count  for words,  of course,  as the next word  that  comes 
             along will be indexed.

             -Because  of wonderful CP/M,  and the fact that some of it's 
             utilities  use end-of-file instead of a control-Z  character 
             to  terminate text,  INDEX cannot detect the following  read 
             errors: unwriten random record, zero length.

             -INDEX sorts in ASCII order.  Digits,  quotes,  parenthesis, 
             etc come before letters.

             -The  sort routine used is horrible.  It uses a bubble sort, 
             with  extra  unnecessary  exchanges.   Didn't  require  much 
             thought, though.
