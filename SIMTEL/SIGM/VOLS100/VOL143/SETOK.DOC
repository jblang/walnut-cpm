TOPIC:  PRESETTING OKIDATA PRINTER OPTIONS


     This simple program allows OKIDATA users to preset a number of
options.  The printer can then be satisfactorily used with the TYPE
command (via CTL-P) or other normal listing programs.


     These options include:  10 or 16.5 chars. per inch
                             64 or 80 chars. per line
                              6 or 8 vertical lines per inch
                              wide print
                              reset to normal default values


     To use, turn on the Okidata printer and then call up SETOK.COM.
It will display various options on its menu.  Several selections can
be made at the same time or a number reentered if mis-typed.  If RET
is immediately typed it defaults to a standard configuration.


            Default is:  10 characters per inch
                         80 characters per line
                          6 vertical lines per inch


     After the appropriate answers have been typed, hit RET to leave
the program (or CTL-C).  The printer now has the options you selected.
The TYPE command (via CTL-P) may then be used or any other LIST routine
desired.

     Obviously some options were not included.  The SETOK.ASM file can
be edited and then reassembled.  (ASM.COM works fine for this purpose.)
Even if the operator is not too familiar with using source code, there
are enough examples already included to make the job of adding some ad-
ditional feature fairly simple.
