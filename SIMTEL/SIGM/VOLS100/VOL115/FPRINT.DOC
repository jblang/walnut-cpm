FPRINT--FORMATTED PRINT ROUTINE

Written by Russ Bakke

This is a general purpose printing routine, which allows a
number of options.  The call is the normal cpm command line:

FPRINT FILENAME.EXT [/options] [#number of copies]

If the filename is not included in the command line, it is
prompted for.  If the options and/or count are not included
in the command line, they are prompted for.

The following options are available:

B(ottom of page prompt (for single sheet printers)
D(ouble spacing
E(nd of text prompt (for friction feed printers, to re-align
  paper)
M(argin on left edge of page
P(unch device (PUN:) instead of PRT:
U(pper case alphabet only (does not affect non-alpha
  characters)
(Note that /B overrides /E)

If the option letters are included in the command line,
they must follow a '/', as '/DUM'.  (Note that the letters
may be in any order).  A '/' with no options will suppress
the prompt.  Note that no processing of the text is performed
except these options; it is up to the preparer of the text
to insure correct line lengths, etc.

The number of copies to be printed may be included in the
command line following the symbol '#'.  The default is one
copy.  The maximum is 255.  If the symbol '#' is not in the
command line, the number of copies will be prompted for.

An error in either the number of copies or options will result
in a prompt for that item.

Examples:
FPRINT TEXT.ASC / #  will print one copy of TEXT.ASC, with
  no options.
FPRINT B:SOURCE.PRN /BDEUMP #2  will print 2 copies of
  B:SOURCE.PRN on the PUN: device, with all options in effect.
