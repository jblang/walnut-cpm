DEL--FILE DELETE COMMAND

WRITTEN BY RUSS BAKKE

THIS IS A DELETE COMMAND PATTERNED AFTER THAT OF RT-11.  I WROTE IT FOR
TWO REASONS:
FIRST, SINCE I FREQUENTLY USE RT-11 I OFTEN MISTAKENLY USE DEL IN STEAD OF
ERA.
SECONDLY, DEL QUERIES FOR CONFIRMATION BEFORE DELETING A FILE.

THE CALL IS THE NORMAL CPM COMMAND LINE:

DEL FILENAME.EXT /OPTION

THE ONLY OPTION SUPPORTED IS NOQ, MEANING NO QUERY.  IF THERE ARE NO
WILD-CARDS (*, ?) IN THE FILENAME OR IF NOQ IS SPECIFIED, ALL FILES MEETING
THE SPECIFICATION ARE DELETED.  OTHERWISE, ALL FILENAMES MEETING THE
SPECFICATION ARE DISPLAYED TO THE USER FOR CONFIRMATION.
A 'Y' MEANS DELETE, ANY OTHER CHARACTER IS A 'NO'.

THE OPTION MUST BE SPECIFIED AS '/NOQ', ELSE THE QUERIES RESULT.
(CAUTION--THIS IS AN EASY WAY TO DELETE FILES YOU DID NOT INTEND TO)

EXAMPLES:
DEL TEXT.ASC WILL DELETE THAT FILE, WITHOUT A QUERY.
DEL TEST.* WILL QUERY ALL FILES OF THAT NAME, DELETING THOSE WHICH
THE USER SPECIFIES.
DEL TEST.* /NOQ WILL DELETE ALL FILES OF THAT NAME.
