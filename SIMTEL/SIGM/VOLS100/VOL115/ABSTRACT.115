	Volume 115 has been put together from a variety of sources. It con- 
tains programs that should be of interest.


	M. Russell Bakke of Stamford, Ct. has provided the following:

COMPASC.ASM and COM: This is a modified version of Ward Christensen's COMPARE 
designed to process ASCII files on a line by line basis. The program will de- 
tect and report inserted and deleted lines and proceed.

COMPBIN.ASM and COM: Another modification of COMPARE intended for binary files.

CPMD2.FOR, CMPDEC.DOC, CPMDEC.FOR: CPMDEC.FOR is a program to process CP/M
format 8" single density floppy disks on a PDP-11 under the RT-11 or TSX-Plus
operating systems. CPMD2.FOR is a short version to be used for bootstrapping
the larger version onto a PDP-11, where no other means is available.

DEL.ASM, COM and DOC: A rather handy program to conditionally erase files.
For each file meeting the file spec in the command line, it asks the user
if that file is to be deleted. The querry is surpressed if there are no
wild cards or if a no querry option is selected.

FPRINT.ASM, COM and DOC: Printer formatting program which sets left margin,
single or double spacing, multiple copies and converts to upper case.

ROMSUM.AM and COM: Verifies ROMs.

UNSPOOL.ASM and COM: A slightly revised version of Gary Novosielski's
program.



	Ron Winter of North Brunswick, NJ has provided a combination
hardware-software for a pseudo run to single step a Z80 S-100
system. The hardware information is in the PSEUDO.DOC file. PSEUDO.ZSM
is the software, with a PRN file included for information purposes.


	The remaining programs are from the Toronto RCP/M Systems.

MORTGAGE.OBJ and PQI: This program calculates monthly payments, total
interest, etc. for any principal and rate using Canadian Mortgage interest
rules.

MUFIX.DOC and MUMATRIX.FIX: Improves the performance of MUMATH.

RCPM.LST: Version 36 of the list of Remote CP/M Software Exchange
Systems using XMODEM. Revised as of April 30, 1983.

T1-TAX82.CQL: A Supercalc template for computing Canadian Federal and
Ontario taxes for 1982. Of interest to others to see what Canadians pay in
taxes.
