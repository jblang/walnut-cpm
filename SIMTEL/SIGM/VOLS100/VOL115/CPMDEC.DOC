DOCUMENTATION FOR CPMDEC.FOR

Overview:
This program allows handling of 8" single density CPM
format disks on a PDP-11 series computer.  The program makes
use of a menu to allow viewing or printing the directory,
copying files to or from the CP/M disk, erasing files,
initializing the disk, etc.  In the Binary copy mode, the
entire file is copied.  In the ASCII copy mode, the EOF
is detected (in either direction) and translated.  For the
user with many files to translate, the program provides
a loop to copy ALL files from the CP/M disk.  In this case,
a floppy disk in the other drive is used for all output
files (usually, any device in the system can be the
target).

Requirements:
PDP-11 series computer with RX-01 or RX-02 disk drives.
RT-11 or TSX-Plus operating system (this program has been
    tested under RT-11 V4 and TSX+ V2.2 and V3.01).
DEC FORTRAN IV V2.5


Compatibility:
This program makes extensive use of RT-11 system calls,
notably ISPFNW but also LOOKUP, IENTER, and others.
Accordingly, if you want to modify it to run on another
system, you are on your own.  Good luck!

Notes:
Due to the extensive use of the USR module (part of the
RT-11 operating system), the program MUST be compiled
/NOSWAP (ie, .FORT/NOSWAP/WARN CPMDEC/LIST).

This program occasionally crashes TSX-Plus.  My Theory is
that this problem is related to the USR swapping over the
program, but I am probably wrong.

For the user who must manually type this program in
(the problem of distributing a DEC program on a CP/M
format disk) a short version (CPMD2.FOR) is provided.
This program, when run, will automatically copy CPMDEC.FOR
to DK0: (and do nothing else).  Then compile CPMDEC.FOR
and you are ready to go.

If you find any bugs, let me know.
