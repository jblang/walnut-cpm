	Remoting the Exidy Sorcerer keyboard.


1. The keyboard may be mounted via 16 core cable.
	Or 16 strand ribbon cable, like mine.
       If using 16 core, be sure to get the colors .     

2. The cable on my system is 2 meters long.
       The keyboard buffer handles it nicely.
       I haven't gone to extremes with the max
	length possible as I think one can bury
	a noisy expansion unit far enough with 2 m.

3. I am also looking at a few layouts for mounting
	my particular setup.2 Micropolis.1 cassette.
	1 GP-80.3 cassette storage units.and natch,
	Sorcerer,expansion,screen.
	Not forgetting the Dataphone.

4. DOING IT.

You will need:
		1.cable
		small piece of verro board. 7 tracks.
		2. 1 x female 14 pin ic socket.
		3. 1 x   male 14 pin ic plug.
	Are you handy with a soldering iron ?
	If so you can most likely do the hookup
	yourself.
	If not drop me a line, I have a friend
	who hooked mine up as a crissy presy.
      2.Are you handy with woodworking ?
	If so you could probably build the box too.
	If not, drop me a line and I'll see how I'm
	fixed for time.
		4.a few bits of 2x1. 1.5 meters.
		5.a piece of 1/8 3 ply. 1.5 sq m.
The keyboard:
	My keyboard is 51cm x 23.5cm x 5.5cm and
	is at an angle of 10 degrees.
	It feels comfortable, but 13 or even 15
	degrees may be better. May even be able to
	reduce the overall mesurements a few cm.
     Not forgetting that the greater angle on the
	keyboard results in a deeper unit.
	Support of the keyboard is front, back
	and sides.
	The cable leadout is at the top, but there
	is no reason why the cable can't wander
	down thru the cutout corner and emit
	down the bottom.
	If you wanted to get fancy, you could
	have a 16 pin socket on the back or side
	and have a neat stand alone unit.
	Want to get really fancy ?
	Run the other 2 lines from the led at the
	back of the computer motherboard.

	DO NOT RUN 240V AS A REMOTE ON OFF SWITCH !!

	It would be most expensive, maybe even fatal
	to do so.
	The led on the keyboard would be a handy
	power on indicator, as well as a visual
	aid for the cassette loading operation.
The keyboard facia:
	If you are doing this bit yourself, it
	is strongly recomended you get a paper
	template of your keyboard.
	I got my patern from the case of the computer
	and it turned out a bit lose.
	The facia can be flattened off at the top
	of the keyboard to provide a handy little
	storage area.
The actual making of the box is a bit tricky, unless
	you're a paternmaker or something.
	As the saying goes, 'The first one 'ect.
	It might even be a good idea to line the
	box where possible with thin foam rubber.
	Helps to cut down on the clunky sound.

	Well .. That's about it.
	If I've forgotten something, drop me a line.

	Yours.   Ian Gray.
