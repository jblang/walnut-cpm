                  ***  TRANSLATING YOUR KEYBOARD   ***
                        ( for the BIG BOARD 1)
             
From "MICRO CORNUCOPIA" , The Journal of the BIG BOARD users, No.4, Feb.,1982.

	This program translates the HEX value of the keyboard characters to
whatever value you want. This is especially nice for defining single-keystroke
codes such as ^C, etc. If you have a RESET key you may translate it to give a 
warm boot.
	The portion called TABLE is a 256 byte table that contains a value for 
each character entered at the keyboard. This will be particularly useful if you
have a keyboard which has extra keys or ones that generate characters that you 
don't need.
	One disadvantage of this program is that it overlays the monitor so 
that it has to rerun each time the system is powered-up or reset. However
this also makes it easy to do different translations for different software.
You could use different tables for WORDSTAR, WORDMASTER, BASIC, etc.
	The program is executed bt simply entering it's name & when finished
it returns to CP/M.

This routine makes it easy to customize keyboards to suit any software that
needs any ^key sequences or even to give a totally different layout, since
ANY key can be ANY code.
