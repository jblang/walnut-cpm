    Items 'A', 'B' and 'C' are books of original entry.  To print out or  
    display these books or the General Ledger, select the 'E' option. To
    post tenant payments to their records or to accrue the monthly rent,
    use the 'D' option.

    The actual ultimate financial statements are prepared with the 'F'
    option.  These include a trial balance, the balance sheet and the   
    profit and loss statement.  Before you prepare these statements you
    must reindex. We have provided for this at a number of points including
    option 'G'.

    Option 'H' takes you the accounting maintenance menu.  On that menu you  
    can adjust the Chart of Accounts, browse through the accounting records,
    etc. See the Accounting Maintenance HELP menu for more information.
