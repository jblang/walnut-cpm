    Welcome to the 'ADD' Menu.  We can now add new buildings to the
    data file - or add new tenants to existing buildings already in
    the data base.                                               
                                                                       
    Note that when you add a building, you will be given the option
    of adding the tenants or the units at the same time.

          <A> add a new building                                    
          <B> add tenants to a building already in the data base
          <C> return to main menu without adding

      The options are rather simple.  In a normal case you would add a 
      building and at the same time add all of the units. (Add them even
      if vacant - just leave the tenant name blank - so that it will 
      appear on the vacancy list).

      When a unit becomes vacant - we suggest you not delete the record
      - but that you delete the name of the tenant. Note, however, the
      automatic rent posting program will post the rental to the unit - 
      so you will have to make an offsetting journal entry for vacancy 
      losses.  Most people do that anyway.

      However, if you want to add a tenant who was never in the data base
      you have that option on this menu.
