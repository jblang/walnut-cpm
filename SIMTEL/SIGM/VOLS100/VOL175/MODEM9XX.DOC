			      SUMMARY:
			      --------
     MODEM9xx  is a public domain CP/M program which works on  many 
different brands of computers.	It is used to send information from 
one  computer  to another,  using either wires or  telephones.	 If 
telephones  are  used,	each computer must use	a  hardware  device 
called a "modem",  hence the name for this program.  It may also be 
used with two computers in the same room cabled directly together.

     Unlike most CP/M programs,  MODEM9xx must be modified for each 
different  brand  of computer on which it is  installed.   This  is 
because  MODEM9xx does not use CP/M in a normal way,  but  communi-
cates directly with the modem port of your computer (bypassing CP/M 
for some functions). 

     You  should  locate a copy of MODEM9xx which has already  been äset up for your model of computer. If you can't find a copy already 
configured for your computer,  you should seek assistance in confi-
guring MODEM9xx to some new or non-standard equipment.	This can be 
done through your computer dealer,  or a user's group in your area.  
It  would  also  be  helpful to have someone show you  how  to	use 
MODEM9xx the first time.

     MODEM9xx uses  the  file transfer routines  written  by   Ward
Christensen  in his CP/M file transfer program (V2.0 as of  8/6/79)  
and  is  compatable with his program in single file transfer  mode. 

     Multi-file  transfers  are possible with two  systems  running  
the program described below.  This is provided by the batch feature  
while  <S>ending  or <R>eceiving files with the <B>ulk	subcommand.  
It  is accomplished with a single line command,  thus  freeing	the 
operator from having to enter a command for each file.

The MODEM9xx program has two principal functions:

     1.  Communication with a timesharing or another CP/M computer.
     2.  Program transfer with error-checking checksum control.

	    NOTE: A special version of the MODEM program exists for
		  the DC Hayes Smartmodem (an external, RS-232 modem).
		  This can be found under filenames beginning with
		  SMODEM, SMODM, SMDM, or SMOD.

		       How to Use MODEM9xx

     In the discussion and examples that follow,  where examples of 
user/computer interaction are used, that which is typed by the user 
is  underlined	with the hyphen (-) symbol on the line beneath	it.  
Those  items that are supplied by the computer are simply typed  as 
they would appear on the screen.   As another convention,  the sym-
bols <CR> denote the entry of a carriage return, and CTRL-S is used 
to mean "hold the control key down while hitting an S."

     MODEM9xx  is  a CP/M command file,  and will  ordinarily  look 
something  like MODEM9xx.COM in a directory.   In order to use	it, 
the  system  should have CP/M running and display the  CP/M  system 
command  prompt  (  A> ) being displayed.   We	are  assuming  that 
MODEM9xx.COM is on drive A:.  MODEM9xx signs on very politely, with 
a  short sign-on message,  and the reminder that to get  Help,	you 
need only to type "H."

"H" option -- <H>elp Screens

     If  the <H>elp option is entered at the  command  prompt,	the 
     <H>elp Screens are displayed.  These three screens of informa-
     tion  outline the options available to the user,  and  provide 
     brief explanations of each.   The <H>elp screens have a prompt 
     that indicates that the user should press any key to continue.  
     These  are  not  "Menus"  and commands must be  given  at	the 
     COMMAND (H for Help): prompt.

	       Single Letter Commands

 H  - Display this information
 ?  - Display current settings
 T  - Terminal mode

COMMAND (H for Help):

     At  this  point MODEM9xx has completed its  hopefully  helpful 
three-screen display and is awaiting your command. The SET  command
will  not be displayed if a setup routine has not been  written for
your UART/MODEM, an alternate command will be dispalyed, TIM, which
allows  you to enter your modem speed so that the program can  give
proper file transfer timing information. The control codes display-
ed  may differ from  those give above  since the user can  redefine
them. We will now enter the second option on the first help screen,
the "?" option.

     In  MODEM9xx there are three different terminal  modes.   They 
are  all used to communicate with other computers.   They  are	all 
slightly  different to allow the user a great degree of flexibility 
in  picking the proper one for the job at hand.   All three may  be 
opened	with an optional file name for capturing text (ASCII)  data 
and saving it as a disk file.  

Terminal Mode - <T>erminal Option
---------------------------------

	  This	is the "normal" terminal mode wherein the  computer 
     is used essentially to emulate a time sharing  terminal.	You 
     will  be  able  to use your computer as if it  were  a  normal 
     terminal  in full duplex mode.   The characters that you  type 
     will  not be printed to the screen as you enter them,  but the 
     screen  will display whatever is sent to it by  the  computer.  
     This  is  the  way  to use your computer  with  most  bulletin 
     boards, RCP/M's, and mainframes.

Terminal Mode - <E>cho Optionä-----------------------------

	  This	terminal  mode automatically echos  characters	re-
     ceived  from another computer.   This is useful if you wish to 
     communicate with somebody running the terminal portion of	the 
     program.  Only one computer should be in this mode at a time.

	  This	<E>cho	terminal mode is used at one end while	the 
     <T>erminal  mode is used at the other end in cases where  key-
     board-to-keyboard communications are desired.  Both ends  will 
     see  anything entered at either end.   This is a useful  setup 
     for  verifying that the connections are right before beginning 
     file transfers.

	REMEMBER. . .	One computer in <E>cho mode, while. . .
			the other must be in <T>erminal mode.

	  Otherwise,  you  will  either not see your own keyed	en-
     tries,  or you will see an eternal ping pong match while  both 
     ends echo some character.	 If this situation occurs,  enter a 
     ConTRoL-E and use the <T>erminal option.

Terminal Mode -- <L>ocal Echo Option
------------------------------------

	  The  <L>ocal	Echo  Terminal option is the  same  as	the 
     <T>erminal  option,  except that the characters entered on the 
     keyboard are echoed back to the screen.   This is useful  when 
     communicating  with the WYLBUR front end processor for the HAL 
     TSO option, or some other computer that does not echo back the 
     characters that it receives.   The local Echo option is essen-
     tially  the same as the <T>erminal option with a  change  from 
     full to half duplex on the modem.

Terminal Mode  --  <T>erminal, <E>cho, or <L>ocal Options
---------------------------------------------------------

	Any of the three terminal options, <T>erminal, <E>cho, or
    <L>ocal echo  may be used  either with or without an optional
    filename specified after the command.

	  If a file name is NOT specified after the  <T>,  <E>,  or 
     <L>  terminal mode command,  then you will be in the so-called 
     "dumb" terminal mode,  and cannot save any of the tranmissions 
     from or to your computer.

	  If a file name IS specified, it should be for a new file. 
     The  information  received by the modem may then be  saved  in 
     memory  and later written on disk.   The save text  in  memory 
     feature is turned ON by ConTRoL-Y, and then OFF by ConTRoL-R.

     The sequence of commands to save a file is:

COMMAND (H for Help):T MESSAGE.TXT make up your own filename,  be 
		     ------------- sure  you have enough free space ä				   on diskette.

NOTE:  You could alternatively have used the <E>cho or <L>ocal echo 
terminal options in place of the <T> terminal option.  The one that 
you select will depend on whom you are communicating with.

	       ConTRoL-Y	   begin holding in memory at  this 
	       ---------	   point;  (you could choose not to 
				   save  your logging-in  transmis-
				   sions).   A colon will appear on 
				   your  CRT  in column 1 of  every 
				   line  to indicate that the  save 
				   feature  is active.	 The  colon 
				   will NOT be saved in your  file, 
				   it  is  just there  to  indicate 
				   that  the  save text  in  memory 
				   feature is on.

	       ConTRoL-R	   turn  off the saving feature  to 
	       ---------	   bypass something.   Nothing will 
				   be saved until another ConTRoL-Y 
				   is  entered.   No colon will ap-
				   pear  at  the the left  edge  of 
				   your CRT at this point.

	       ConTRoL-E	   Exits  <T>erminal (or any)  mode 
	       ---------	   and	returns  to  the   MODEM9xx 
				   command prompt.

COMMAND (H for Help): WRT	   You MUST enter WRT at this point 
		      ---	   to  move the data from memory on 
				   to  a diskette.   If you  forget 
				   this, you can forget about find-
				   ing	anything in your "file"  on 
				   diskette.

Additional notes about the <T>, <E>, or <L> Terminal options:

     1.  ConTRoL-Y causes the transmission to be held in a "buffer" 
     in  memory.   Only  the WRT command (after you return  to	the 
     menu) will move it into your file on diskette.

     2.  After	viewing  the transmission,  and placing it  into  a 
     buffer in memory,	you may decide that you DO NOT want to save 
     it.   Simply eliminate entering the WRT command,  and go on to 
     something else.

     3. Be sure you have enough free diskette space to hold the new 
     file  you	are creating with the WRT command.   You must  make 
     sure ahead of time.

     4.  If  the  memory buffer fills up while you are receiving  a 
     lengthy transmission,  MODEM9xx will automatically stop recei-
     ving.   It will ask the other computer to wait,  by sending an 
     X-OFF  or	ConTRoL-S.   It will then write the information  to ä     your disk file,  and ask the other computer to begin transmit-
     ting more information by sending an X-ON or  ConTRoL-Q.   Your 
     computer  will then resume receiving  the	transmission.	You 
     will  not lose anything if the other computer understands X-ON 
     and X-OFF.

     5.   The memory buffer is from the top of the modem program to 
     the bottom of BDOS.  In a 64k machine,  this is usually enough 
     to  hold 20 minutes of steady transmission at 300 baud,  or  5 
     minutes at 1200 baud.   The computer with which you are commu-
     nicating  must  accept the X-ON and X-OFF (ConTRoL-Q and  Con-
     TRoL-S)  protocol convention or data will be lost	while  your 
     buffer is written to your disk file.   You can verify that the 
     other  computer  will wait by entering a ConTRoL-S  from  your 
     keyboard  and seeing if the transmission stops until you enter 
     ConTRoL-Q.

     6.   If  the transmission or file you are receiving is smaller 
     than your memory buffer (approx.  your memory size,  less 27k) 
     then you do not have to worry because you will not have to try 
     to pause the remote system while you write.   If it is  larger 
     than your buffer,	AND the remote system does not recognize X-
     ON  and  X-OFF,  you may have to break the  transmission  into 
     smaller pieces.

     7.   Receiving a program source file such as .ASM or .BAS	can 
     be  done  in any of the terminal modes from  another  computer 
     which is NOT using MODEM9xx.   However, be aware that you have 
     no error	checking in the <T>,  <E>,  or <L> terminal  modes.
     These  should  only be used for program  transfers  where	the 
     other  computer does not have the MODEM9xx program.   You	may 
     want  to transmit two copies of a file,  then use CRCK or COM-
     PARE  to see if identical copies were received.   This is	NOT 
     needed if both ends have MODEM9xx and the <S>end and <R>eceive 
     modes were used for the file transfer.

     8.  If a filename is  NOT	specified after the <T>, <E>, or <L>
     terminal command, then transmissions can not be saved.

     9.   When communications are done,  use ConTRoL-E to exit from
     the <T>,  <E>, or <L> terminal mode and see the command prompt 
     again.

     10.  If you chose any terminal mode with a filename,  the file 
     to  which you  are writing  must then be closed by  using	the  
     "WRT"  command.  If this is not done, all data will be lost.

     11.  The  original author of MODEM (Ward Christensen)  decided 
     not   to  close   the file automatically since there  will  be  
     times  when you leave the terminal mode and then decide to re-
     enter.   This may be done while at the Command prompt by using 
     the  "NOL" command.   You may put data into the same  file  as 
     many  times  as  you wish as long as you have not	closed	the 
     fil1 with	the "WRT" command.
ä
TO SEND A FILE FROM TERMINAL MODE:
----------------------------------

	  While in <T>, <E>, or <L> terminal mode, a ConTRoL-T will 
     put  you in File Transfer mode.   This will allow you to  send 
     the  contents of an ASCII file over the modem.   This  routine 
     does  no error checking and  there are no protocols  specified 
     between  this program and the  receiving computer	other  than 
     that  it should be ready  to receive data via the modem.	The 
     use of ConTRoL-X will cancel the transfer.

	  You  could use this mode to send MBOOT.ASM or other  pro-
     grams to another computer which is not using MODEM8xx.  If the 
     other computer is not using one of the MODEM programs,  do not 
     bother to try to use the <S>end or <R>eceive options explained 
     below.   They require coordinated error checking by one of the 
     MODEM programs at both ends.


FILE TRANSFER - <S>end and <R>eceive Options
-------------

	  <S>end  and <R>eceive are the same as in the	CP/M  Modem  
     program  written by Ward Christensen except that upon  comple-
     tion  of the transfer,  control returns to the Command  prompt 
     unless  the  secondary "T" option has been selected.   In	the 
     latter case, control returns to <T>erminal mode.

	  Remember  that if you are operating a remote CP/M  (RCPM) 
     computer  using a timesharing program (such as Ward  Christen-
     sen's "BYE"),  the remote system's XMODEM program will send or 
     receive  single files (except .COM).   This is done using com-
     mands of the same general format as outlined below for MODEM9xx.

	  Examples of commands for  <S>ending  and  <R>eceiving are
     listed below.

Multi-file transfers  (not available with XMODEM programs on RCPM's)
--------------------

	  Using the  <B>ulk  batch secondary option,  more than one
     file may be transferred.	Ambiguous  filenames are  accepted.
     This is one of the major  enhancements  of  MODEM7  and  later
     versions of the MODEM program.

	  To <S>end a <B>ulk batch of files,  enter  SB followed by
     one or more filenames.  For example:

	  COMMAND (H for Help): SB B:ST*.BAS C:SWEEP.DOC D:*.*

	  The individual filenames should be separated by a  space, 
     and  should  include  the correct	drive  identifier  (B:	 C:  
     etc.).   If  no drive identifier is specified,  the  currently 
     logged drive will be assumed to contain the file(s).ä
	  The filenames may contain wildcards ( * or ?, where  the
     asterisk may match any string of characters,  and the question 
     mark may represent any one character)

	  As of 1/1/83, there was a 64 filename maximum; be careful 
     using those wildcards.

	  Ensure  that	the  receiving computer's  disk  drive	has 
     enough free space to hold the  file(s) that you are  <S>ending
     to it.

	  To  <R>eceive a <B>ulk batch of files,  enter RB followed
     only by the disk drive specifier (B: C: etc.)  For example,

		    COMMAND (H for Help): RB B:<CR>  
					  ---------
     You  DO NOT enter filenames at the receiving end during  batch 
     transfers.  They are sent with the files.

	  If you merely enter RB and omit the drive specifier,	the 
     default  or currently logged-in drive will be used to  receive 
     the file.	For example:

		    Drive A
		    COMMAND (H for Help): RB <CR>
					  -------
      the command shown here is telling the computer to <R>eceive a
      <B>ulk batch of files, placing them on the currently logged or
      default drive.  The Default drive in this case is A:, as shown
      on the line above the COMMAND (H for Help): prompt line.
Using the <V>iew secondary option:
------------------------------------

     If  you are receiving a file you know to be  readable  (ASCII) 
such  as a .DOC documentation file,  you can view it as it is being 
<R>eceived.   This  can be a real timesaver if it is used to <V>iew 
documentation files being <R>eceived while trying to decide whether
or not to transfer software from a remote machine.   Simply add the 
letter "V" following the letter "R" in your <R>eceive command.	For
example:
		    Drive A
		    COMMAND (H for Help): RV MODEM9xx.DOC<CR>
					  -------------------


MODEM9xx Command Examples:
--------------------------

Note:	All of these examples assume you are at the "COMMAND (H for 
Help):" prompt of MODEM9xx.   If you are still in one of the termi-
nal modes, enter a ConTRoL-E to get to this prompt.


     SINGLE FILE TRANSFERS:ä     ----------------------

	S MODEM.DOC		<S>ends MODEM.DOC from logged-in drive

	R B:MODEM.DOC		<R>eceives MODEM.DOC on drive B: disk


	S B:MODEM.DOC		<S>ends from drive B:

	R A:MODEM.DOC		<R>eceives on drive A:


     MULTIPLE FILE TRANSFERS:

     THREE LETTER COMMANDS DEFINED
     -----------------------------ä
	       Three Letter Commands

DIR - List directory and space free (may specify drive)
CPM - Exit from this program to CP/M
ERA - Erase file (may specify drive)
LOG - Change default drive/user (specify drive/user)
      and reset disks.	e.g. LOG A0, LOG B (user unchanged)
FOP - Display commands for setting terminal mode file
      output parameters
DSC - Disconnect the modem from the telephone line
TCC - Toggle Checksum/CRC mode on receive
TBR - Toggle backspace to rub conversion
TLC - Toggle  1) local command immediate
	      2) local command after ctrl-^
TLF - Toggle send linefeed after carriage return
NUM - List remote systems
SET - Set communication ports

     The following are terminal text buffer commands:
DEL - Delete memory buffer and file
NOL - Return to terminal mode - no loss of data in buffer
WRT - Write memory buffer to disk file 

  DIR - The  "DIR" command lists the directory of a CP/M disk.	 It
	also  shows the amount of space free on the disk  expressed 
	in Kilobytes.  A drive may be specified (ie. DIR B:) or the 
	default drive will be listed.  Wildcards (*'s and ?'s)	may 
	be  used  the  same as when DIR is run from the  A>  prompt 
	under CP/M.  For example, 

	      Drive A
	      COMMAND (H for Help): DIR B:*.BAS<CR>
				     --------------
	would  display a directory listing of all files on Drive B: 
	with any FILENAME that have a file type of .BAS.

  CPM - The "CPM" command ends the MODEM program and returns to CP/M.

    >>>>---->  THIS IS HOW YOU EXIT THE MODEM9xx PROGRAM.  <----<<<<
		   COMMAND (H for Help): CPM<CR>
					 -------
		   A>
	 The  computer	will respond with the  CP/M  system  command 
	prompt.

  LOG - The  "LOG"  command  allows you to  change  your  currently 
	logged	in  (default) disk drive and user level.   It  also 
	allows	you to change disks in the drive.   This  comes  in 
	handy  when you wish to bring in a large file and your	DIR 
	shows that you don't have enough disk space to hold it.

  FOP - This command  displays a  submenu of three letter  commands
	which effect terminal mode file output.
ä  DSC - This  command will disconnect the modem from the  telephone
	if  your system has that capabiltiy.  If disconnect is  not
	possible then this command can be eliminated from the  menu
	at assembly time.

  TCC - This  allows  you  to select the default  method  of  error 
	checking protocol for transferring data.

  TBR - The "TBR" command lets you change the "backspace" character 
	to  a "rubout" character when communicating with  terminals 
	or computers that need it.

  TLC - This  changes the local command mode from an immediate type 
	to  one that sends a control character to a remote  machine 
	only after a ConTRoL-^.

  TLF - This  allows  you to either send or not send  a  "linefeed" 
	character  after  every "carraige return" sent out  in	the 
	terminal  mode.

  NUM - This command displays on the screen a listing of frequently 
	called	telephone numbers,  such as those for  computerized 
	Bulletin Board systems, Remote CP/M's, etc.

  SET - The  "SET"  command  allows you to set	the  communications 
	ports for the PMMI modem,  and for certain other  machines.  
	You  may  be able to change things like  baud  rates,  word 
	length, number of stop bits, and so on.  This is not imple-
	mented	for  most machines,  as the assumption is that	you 
	will be able to set these things on your machine through  a 
	manufacture-supplied  utility called CONFIG.COM,  CONFIGUR-
	.COM, SETUP.COM, or the like.

 TIM -  If the SET command is not implimented then this command  is
	used to set the baud rate so that the program can  properly
	display the time to transfer a file.

 DEL -  The  "DEL"  command  erases the most recent file   accessed  
	in  Terminal mode.   This is used when you decide  after  a 
	communication  session that you don't want to save on  disk 
	the information just gathered.

  NOL - Use the "NOL" command to RE-ENTER any of the three terminal 
	modes with NO Loss of data after going to the command  mode 
	with a CTRL-E.	 If this is done, you will still be able to 
	save the information in the memory buffer if you were doing 
	so before you quit the terminal mode.	Note that this will 
	return you to whichever terminal mode (<T>erminal,  <E>cho, 
	or  <L>ocal  Echo)  you were using before you went  to	the 
	command mode.

  WRT - The  "WRT"  command  must be used  after  leaving  Terminal  
	mode.  This writes the last buffer to disk and closes	the 
	file.	Failure to use the "WRT" command results in loss of 
	all data and a file of length zero.ä

     Commands for Setting Terminal Mode File Output Parameters

SPD - Set speed of file output
TEF - Toggle transmission of end-of-file character
TSL - Toggle stripping linefeeds
TWE - Toggle wait for character echo
TXF - Toggle XOFF testing
TXN - Toggle XON waiting after <CR>

  SPD - The  "SPD" command allows you to add delay time after  each 
	character  sent  or each carraige  return  sent.   This  is 
	useful	if you are communicating with a hard copy  terminal 
	or  even a mainframe that cannot capture the characters  as 
	fast as you can send them.

  TEF - When transferring a text file to another CP/M system it  is
	sometimes useful to send an end-of-file (EOF) marker.  This
	toggle will turn on/off sending an EOF.

  TSL - When  sending text to a mainframe it  is usually  desirable
	not to transmit linefeeds. On the other hand, when  sending 
	text files  to another CP/M system it is usually  desirable
	to  send linefeeds.  This  toggle will  turn on/off sending
	linefeeds.

  TWE - If  the remote echoes, one of the most reliable methods  of 
	sending text is to wait for the transmitted character to be
	echoed. This toggle will turn this option on/off.

  TXF - Some mainframes (and micros) send XOFF when they want  your
	micro to stop transmitting and send XON when they are ready
	to resume accepting text. This toggle will turn XOFF  test-
	on/off.

  TXN - Certain systems, such as the ASCII interfaces for IBM 370s,
	always send an XOFF on receipt of a <CR> and send XON  when
	the system is prepared to receive another line. This toggle
	turns on/off waiting for an XON after a <CR>.

NOTE: Only one of the TWE, TXF and TXN toggles can be on.


LOCAL COMMANDS THAT MAY BE USED WHILE IN THE TERMINAL MODE
----------------------------------------------------------

     Local Commands while in Terminal Mode

ctrl-E	- Exit to command mode
ctrl-O  - Transmit string
     Must be followed by number of string (0-9)
     or L to display list of strings
ctrl-P	- Toggle printer
ctrl-Y	- Start copy into bufferäctrl-R	- Stop copy into buffer
     Start & Stop may be toggled as often as desired.
     A ":" at start of line indicates buffer is open.
     XOFF automatically used to stop input when writing
     full buffer to disk, XON sent to resume.
ctrl-T	- Transfer ASCII file to remote
ctrl-^	- Send local control character to remote

CTRL-E	This command is the way to leave any mode and return to the
	COMMAND (H for Help): prompt.  You may then use your choice
	of the three-letter commands.

CTRL-O	This allows you to transmit pre-defined strings of characters
	characters if they have been put into your program.

CTRL-P	This will  cause  the  characters  sent to the screen to be
	simultaneously	sent to the printer,  or LST:  device.	 It
	works the same way as the printer toggle in the CP/M opera-
	ting  system.	The  first use turns it on,  the second use
	turns it off, etc.

CTRL-Y	This is used with the CTRL-R command to control the process
	of putting text into the memory buffer.   The CTRL-Y begins
	putting text into the buffer, while the CTRL-R suspends the
	process.

CTRL-T	This initiates the  transmission  of  a  text (ASCII) file
	without any error checking protocol.   This should be used
	to send text files to machines that are not running any of
	the MODEM programs.


NOTE:   The control codes displayed  by the program  may differ from
those give above since they can be redefined at assembly time.


		      A Typical Session With MODEM9xx

     The computer is on and the CP/M operating system is 'booted' so
that  the screen displays the A> command prompt from CP/M.   We have
inserted the disk with MODEM9xx.COM into disk drive A:	We will wish
to write on disk A: so we 'warm-boot' with a ConTRoL-C.
