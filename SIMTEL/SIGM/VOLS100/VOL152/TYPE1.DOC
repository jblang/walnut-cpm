                            TYPE1.COM
                            ---------

     TYPE1  is a machine language alternative to the C program to 
type  files.  It  will  automatically  unsqueeze  files,  exclude 
certain files, and more! Since it is only 2k long, no disk should 
be without it!

     Since it accepts the same syntax, you may use it as follows:

TYPE *.bas b:q*.?q? C:start.qqz

     Several  parameters  may be set in  the  system.  These  are 
paging size,  maximum number of lines/file, exclude system files, 
exclude list of extensions, and mask control characters.

     The  paging size option allows you to control the number  of 
lines  per page.  If you do not wish paging to occur,  simply set 
this byte to zero.

     Maximum number of lines per file controls how many lines  of 
a  file can be listed before an error message occurs.  If you  do 
not  want to limit the number of lines listed,  set this byte  to 
zero.

     Exclude  system files,  when set to X'FF',  totally  ignores 
system  files,  and "tagged" files.  No error message is printed, 
the  file is simply forgotten!  If you would like to be  able  to 
list system files, just set this byte to X'00'.

     Exclude  extensions,  when set to X'FF',  will exclude files 
like .COM,  .OBJ, .INT, .ABS and so on. If you would like to list 
these files (?), just set this byte to X'00'.

     Mask control characters,  when set to X'FF', will only allow 
X'0D',  X'0A',  X'07',  X'09' and X'08'.  If you want all control 
charaters listed, set this byte to X'00'.

     By now,  most of you are wondering where these bytes are! If 
you  DDT the TYPE1.COM file,  and 'D'ump it,  you will  see  text 
messages  in  the first 200 or so bytes directing you exactly  to 
the location of the right byte!
