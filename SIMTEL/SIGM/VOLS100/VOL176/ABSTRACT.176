 	LU (library utility) is found on SIG/M Volume 119. To use it for this
disk, however, merely type LU. At the prompt type -O to open a file. Then type
the name of the file (without the .LBR). To list the file (after it is open),
type -L. To extract the files in the library type -e *.* (or the specifics of
the file or files you want to extract). To close the file and extract from
another file type -C.  To exit after the file is closed, hit CONTROL C. There
are many other things you can do with LU, so take a look at the original docu-
mentation on 119. (The updated version, which appears on this disk, is found
on Volume 156.

	USQ is called by typing USQ *.* or the specifics of the file you want
to unsqueze. (USQ will also give you a prompt and a help file is you just type
USQ.  We have included the source code to USQ on this disk - just incase some-
one would like to write a version of FIND that can handle a squeezed file. If
someone does, we can probably put the CPMUG catalog back on Volume 0. 

	DU-V86 appeared on SIG/M 152. However, the .LBR file on this disk con-
tains the source code.
