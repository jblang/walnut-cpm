	This disk contains a forth compiler for the Motorola MC86000 and
an updated version of ATARIBUS.LBR which allows one to connect an Atari
and a CP/M computer. We had previously thought it of enough interest to
release a version of it found on a bulletin board. However, the author,
Dave Walker, pointed out that the full version (which is on this disk) is
needed to install this system if you don't have a BDS "C" compiler. We
do not have enough room on the disk to add LU.COM so that you can remove
the file from the library. However, it is available on SIG/M volume 156
as well as on many disks that contain .LBR files.   Dave's memo and
Ray Buvel's memo on the Forth compiler are set forth below.

FORTH based compiler for Motorola MC68000 by:

Raymond L. Buvel

Moscow, ID 83843

This disk contains a compiler for the Motorola MC68000 that compiles a subset 
of the FORTH language.  The files are as follows:

M68K.DOC
	Text of an article describing the compiler that was sent to Dr. Dobb's
	Journal.  This article should be read before doing anything else.

LIST1.LST
LIST2.LST
LIST3.LST
	Listings refered to in the above article.

M68COMP.SCR
	FORTH source code for the compiler.  This code was developed and tested
	on Laboratory Microsystems Z-80 FORTH version 1.14 but should be 
	transportable to any fig-FORTH or FORTH-79 system with little 
	modification.  This file is a random access screen file supported by
	Z-80 FORTH.  LIST2.LST contains a listing of this file in a format that
	can be printed or edited with any CP/M editor.

SCREEN.C
SCREEN.COM
	Utility program for producing a listing of a Z-80 FORTH screen file.  
	Note.. the screen file can contain no unallocated screens or this 
	utility will not work properly nor will PIP and many other routines.    
	This program can be compiled with C80 from The Software Toolworks.  To 
	reproduce LIST2.LST type SCREEN <M68COMP.SCR >LIST2.LST
	Note that the input and output can be redirected to any device 
	supported by CP/M.

     I recently discovered that a ATARI to CP/M interface package 
which I had written has been contributed to the SIG/M library.  I 
did not contribute it but I had planned to contribute it whenever 
I  got ambitious enough to fill out the form and drop it  in  the 
mail with a diskette.   Being slow about these things I would not 
have  gotten around to it for a while so I was glad to hear  that 
someone  went  and  did it for me.   However it has  come  to  my 
attention  that several files were removed from the  ATARIBUS.LBR 
file  which  are critical to installing the package on  a  system 
when  the BDS "C" compiler is not available.   Some of the  files 
affected were:

     AS.COM
     AS.SYM
     AMON.COM
     AMON.SYM
     AFC.COM

I  have  received  a few letters and phone calls  requesting  the 
missing  files and in the hopes of making things easier on anyone 
wanting to implement the system I have included on this  diskette 
another  copy of the ATARIBUS.LBR file which includes the missing 
files.   I  would appreciate it if you could somehow replace  the 
previously released version with this version.

     As  a  long time user of public domain programs I  am  happy 
that  I can start to repay my debt by having one of  my  programs 
included  on  a  SIG/M disk and I hope to  be  sending  you  more 
material  as soon as I get ambitious enough to finish off some of 
it.

     Thank you for the interest please continue the great job.
