1.  It is always a real pleasure to pass on an upgraded program.
    Ironfingers Penley had bought a hard copy of a government public
    domain program of LISP written in Pascal. He converted it to 
    Pascal/Z but pooped out before he got all the bugs out. He donated
    the program on Zug volume #14. Then Lanfranco Emiliani of the 
    Netherlands took and de-bugged it, added some bells and whistles
    and donated it back to us. I think he has done a good job and for
    those of you who are interested in artificial intellegence, this
    is a good starting point.

2.  Rex Buddenberg has come through for us again. This time he took
    on the public-key crypto subject. It is not complete, but he has
    started on it and for anybody who can help push out the frontiers
    they are certainly most welcome. As a relief, he has included a 
    simplistic  program on large formating. It is different in that
    there is provisions for a 80 column and a 132 column size printer.

A note from Rex with the submission states:


PRIME..

          prime.pas           prime.com
          prime1.pas
          (random.pas from the library) 
          (unit1.pas/pz from the library) 

PRIME  was  an  attempt  to implement  the  RSA  data  encryption 
algorithm  found in Byte,  Jan 83,  p 198,  by John  Smith.   Not 
everything works,  so I didn't submit it all but some lessons may 
help others.  See PRIME.DOC for more detail.


SIGNS

Files:    signs.pas
          font.dat

          signs6.com
          signs11.com

The  signs programs are an update of the earlier version  in  VOL 
19.   Output may now be routed to screen, printer or a file.  The 
program  also looks more like real Pascal rather than warmed over 
BASIC  now.   The  two  .com  files are  for  6  and  11  letters 
respectively.



3.  CLAY CARLEY III of Spokane, Wash has written a combination useful
    utility and a CPM function tutorial. His program will erase a file
    in a user friendly way and uses functions calls to do a lot of its
    work, which is educational for you CPM'ers.

4.  Greg Acland wrote some interesting comments to this library file so
    for those who are interested in random numbers better check this out.

5.  The teachers in Sacramento, Ca were using this program for their
    students but I never had time to see if it would run, as is, but I
    didn+'t want this to go to waste. So I am including it for anyone
    who would like to do it as a project. There is a copyright release
    by the authors.

6.  Ray Penley, bless his iron-fingers, has upgraded his student
    programs. Read TUTOR.PRN to get some excellent pointers and
    instructions on programing.
