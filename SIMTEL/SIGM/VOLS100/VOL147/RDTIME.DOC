These two routines are to read the Compupro System Support clock with the
System Support board located at port 50H.

There is a routine call SETTIME to set the Compupro clock.

The routines put the date and time into a string named DATESTR which you
furnish and is formated as 'MM/DD/YY  HH:MM:SS'.

These routines are used in VFILER11, PRINT10B, WHATSNEW found on SIG/M vol 146
and WM-PATCH on this SIG/M volume.

NOTE: if you are not using a Compupro System Support clock you must rewrite
      the RDTIME routines in the programs or set the CLOCK equate to FALSE.

The CLOCK equate is set to FALSE in VFILER11 but set to TRUE in PRINT10B,
WHATSNEW and WM-PATCH.
