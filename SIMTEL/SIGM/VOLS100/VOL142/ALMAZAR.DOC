                          ALMAZAR I
                  Original by Winston Llamas
       Published in 80 Micro, Anniversary edition 1983


Almazar part 1 is a 72 room adventure. It was published in the 
1983 anniversary edition of 80 Micro,  to run on a TRS 80 with 
Disc Basic.  This version is translated to MBASIC 5.21.  Since 
it was done on an Osborne with a 52 column screen, some of the 
layouts reflect the narrow format (some don't).

The suite consists of the following:-

        ALMAZAR.BAS The instructions plus chain to.....
        SFAMAIN.BAS The main programme
        SFAVOC.0    The vocabulary of instructions and objects
        SFAMOVE.0   The data file of moves
        SFALDES.0   The location descriptions
        SFAOBDES.0  The object description file
        SFARESP.0   The (computers) response file

The  data files were set up by file creation programs with the 
same  Name as the data file,  but with the Type of  BAS.  This 
allows  the  game  to be changed at will  for  new  locations,  
responses etc.

If the game is SAVEd for later resumption, a file SFA/SAV.0 is 
created.

Good Luck!
