			ZESOURCE
	      disassembler for Z-80 programs
		Version 2.0 by Dave Barker

Let me open this file with a note of appreciation to Ward Christensen
who wrote RESOURCE for 8080 programs.  ZESOURCE is a modification to
Ward's original program (CPMUG vol. 42) to give it the capability of
disassembling Z-80 object into TDL mnemonic source files.  Thanks to
Ward this must be the most powerful disassembler available for 8080/Z-80
code.  (Note: ZESOURCE still runs on an 8080 machine)

A file called Z80TEST.COM was used to test ZSOURCE.  When Z80TEST.COM
is disassembled it will result in what would be an alphabetic listing
of all of the Z-80 opcodes if the mnemonics were Zilog's instead of
TDL's.  This object file should agree exactly with the listings that 
Zilog has in their 'Z-80 CPU Programming Reference Card' and in the
back of 'Z-80 Assembly Language Programming Manual'.

It should be pointed out that ZSOURCE will generate TDL opcode mnemonics
but not TDL pseudo-op mnemonics.  The pseudo-op mnemonics are the same
as those generated by RESOURCE (ORG, DB, DW, DS, and EQU).  If one is
using a TDL type of assembler it is a simple matter to use .OPSYN to
equate ORG with .LOC, DB with .BYTE, etc.

The primary documentation for ZESOURCE is Ward's RESOURCE.DOC (CPMUG
42.19).  Listed below is a description of the enhancements added to
ZESOURCE.COM:

	1.Disassembly to TDL mnemonics

	2.Typing 'Rfilename.ALL' will cause the .DOC, .SYM, and .CTL
	  files to all be read in for 'filename'.  If one of the files
	  is missing from the disk the read operation will abort. 
	  Note also that the 'Uxxxx' command must still be used prior 
	  to using 'R'.
 
	3.Typing 'Sfilename.ALL' will cause all three of the files
	  mentioned above to be saved.

	4.When the 'E' command is used to create a new symbol the existing
	  symbol at that address (if there is one) will be automatically
	  killed with a message sent to the console so stating.  If there
	  is more than one symbol at that address (impossible if the
	  .SYM file was created under ZESOURCE) only the first in the
	  table will be killed.

	5.Use of 'L' command in the format 'L=xx,addr' causes the new
	  default length, xx, to take effect immediately (this is a bug
	  in CPMUG 42.18).

As time and ambition are available it is planned to modify ZESOURCE to
produce Zilog mnemonics.
