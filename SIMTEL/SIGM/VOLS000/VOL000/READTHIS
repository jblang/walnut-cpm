     This  disk  contains  the  catalog listings  for  the  SIG-M 
library  in  two files.  Volumes are listed in reverse order  and 
SIG0.CQT contains a list of all disks after Volume 150. The first 
150 volumes are in a file called SIG1.CQT. Because of space needs 
we squeezed both files. The program USQ.COM is on the disk and if 
you  have  a double density system you can  merely  usqueeze  the 
(Command is USQ SIG?.CQT) to produce SIG0.CAT and SIG1.CAT.

     However,  it is really not necessary to unsqueeze.  You  can 
page  through the file (backwards and forward) using the  program 
SHOW.COM  (Command  is SHOW SIG0.CQT).  The paging commands  will 
appear  on  the  bottom  of the screen.   Also  on  the  disk  is 
FYNDE.COM,  a  version of FIND.COM that works with  squeezed  and 
unsqueezed files. To use type FYNDE SIG?.C* STRING. (Typing FYNDE 
SIG?.C*  MODEM  will  locate all instances where the  mord  modem 
appears in the catalog since it will search both listings.)

     A listing of SIG-M Distribution points is included in a file 
REGIONS.SIG.   It is preferable for you to obtain  SIG-M software 
from  the  local distribution points rather than   directly  from 
SIG-M.               

    A  printed  SIG-M  catalog is available  for  $3.00  (US  and 
Canada) or $4.00(foreign).
