This version resolves the differences between my version 1.1 and
Paul Traina's version 1.4 of changes to ZCPR. In addition, several
useful additions suggested by others along the way have been added,
usually as conditional assembly to allow you to ignore them if you
so choose. Since NZCPR-14 has been out awhile, the shorter DIF file
between that and NZCPR-16 is supplied as well.

Noteworthy changes are as follows:

1) Splitting up conditionals for TYPE, LIST, and DIR so that TYPE and
   DIR can be generated separately from each other. LIST still must
   have TYPE to be used, but TYPE can be generated without LIST.

2) TYPE changed to allow only carriage return, line feed, form feed,
   tab, bell, and the WordStar (tm) end of line hyphen among the
   non-displayable chars -- all other control chars are tossed.

3) High-order bit used to delimit message strings stripped in OUTPUT,
   to prevent getting unwanted graphic chars in a DIR listing after
   using control-P.

4) Cleaned up and conditional'ed the dynamic user area control feature.

5) Genned in the original Digital Research copyright notice. If some
   scoundral tries to turn an undeserved profit on ZCPR ala IE/MODEM,
   I expect Digital Research to fall on them.

6) The usual minor internal documentation changes.

Note that no version of NZCPR that I know of allows all options to
be assembled in at once, i.e. if you want SECURE mode, you'll probably
need to give up TYPE and/or DIR, and vice/versa. Make sure that after
you select the options you want, that the generated output still fits
in the 2k space allowed by CP/M, or you will be sorry.

Address comments or appeal for help to me on the Hyde Park RCPM
in Chicago. I'm all ears.
