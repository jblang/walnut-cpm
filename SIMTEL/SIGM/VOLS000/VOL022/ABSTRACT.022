quality.  It seems that we are a success.
     
1.   CFIO.LIB       Add this to your library.  It is a program
                    to help you open files, really nice. By the
                    way ,the CF means Connect Files.   

2.   CONCORD.COM    This a program that builds an alphabetical
            .PAS    listing of all the distinct words which
            .CCD    appear in a text file.(Useful by a programer
                    in locating garbage variables in a program)
                    Makes heavy use of pointers and the data
                    string. Some good ideas here.

3.   COSINE.PAS     Before the bug got fixed, this was our
           .REL     subsituted Cosine program. It is now new
           .SRC     and improved.

4.   GEN5.COM       A demo on accessing CP/M files and read-
         .PAS       them back. Instructional for the noivce.

5.   GRAPH1.COM     A demo on creating a graphic representation
           .PAS     of a function.

6.   ISORTV1.COM    A insertion sort with linked list.This
            .PAS    program can be easily adapted to sort single
                    characters, integer numbers, real numbers
                    months or any item that can be ordered.

7.   LINENOS.COM    Many times it is difficult to keep track
            .PAS    of text lines. This program will number
                    your lines for you so it will be easy to
                    count or find.

8.   POINT.COM      A demo on the use of pointers taken from
          .PAS      page 49 of the Pascal/Z manual.

9.   RANDOM.MAC     A professional random number generator
                    for your library. Two years of testing
                    went into this one, should be good.
9A.  RANDOM.PAS     Something simple Bob threw in.       

10.  SINCOS.SRC     A debugged sine/cosine that works.
           .REL

11.  STRLIB.DOC     Ray Penley's latest updated string lib.
           .LIBŠ
12.  TRIG4.COM      A simple Demo program that builds a
          .PAS      short Trig chart.

13.  XREFG2.COM     This is a binary tree type cross-ref
           .PAS     generator. Very useful and very in-
                    structive.

14.  ZPTEX.COM      A very simple text formatter intended
          .PAS     for CAI. Lesson 4 is a sample.
     LESSON4.

15.  RECIPE.COM     Here is a good example of what can
           .PAS     be done. RAY took a Basic program and
           .MST     converted it to Pascal/Z. Your wifes
     RCPDAT.YYY     will love this program because it is
                    practical, useable AND its not your
                    simple recipe program. Its for left
                    overs also.

16.  FCLOSE.COM     Three different ways to close a file
	   .PAS	    in Pascal/Z.
