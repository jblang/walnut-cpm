	I was very fortunate this month, I was able to talk a
company named PCE SYSTEMS into donating this complete disk of
Z80 software.  They had paid a programer to write it excusively
for them but their Microcomputer products evolved so rapidly
that by the time it was ready, they didn't need it anymore.
Nowdays they boot directly into CPM.  So we lucked out, we now
have the complete source and the manual for it, all on this
disk.  You can bet, I'll be trying to get other manufactures to 
do the same thing with their outmoded software.

	This disk is so large however that I couldn't edit/verify
to see if this stuff works but I have been assured by PCE SYSTEMS 
that it does.  So whoever gets it up and running I would appreciate
it if they would drop me a line outlining their views on it.
