something special comes along I'll just stick to this format.


1.   AUTHOR.PAS/COM--A general purpose "keyword in context"
                     program. Includes samples.

2.   CALC.PAS--Here is your built in calculator adapted to 
               Pascal/Z.  The number crunchers among us should
               take this and expand it to its limit.  But its
               got good potential as is, now just patch it so
               the results go to either the printer or the
               disk and then you'll have a permenent record.

3.   CPLOT.PAS/COM--A simple banner idea but useful for simple
                    designs, just to be different.

4.   DELAY.PAS/REL/SRC--Ray Penley tells me I goofed by not
     INPORT.REL/SRC     including these in with the volume #1.
     OUTPORT.REL/SRC    So here they are and let me know of any
     KEYIN.REL/SRC      other goofs.

5.   NAD.PAS/COM--A general purpose "Permuted keyword index"
                  program. A good start but needs to be up
                  gradeds to become classy.

6.   TDIABLO.MAC/COM--Driver for Diablo which works for the
                      Teletek FDC-1 board.

7.   DIABLO.Z80/COM--Driver for Diablo which works for the
                     SD System S-100.

8.   RANDOM.PAS/COM--This random generator implements the
                     Fibonacci series approach.

9.   REBOOT.COM--In volume #1 I included a Autoboot program.
                 This is an example of ideas breeding ideas.Š                 Tim Oleseo saw it and said there is a
                 better way. In this one you type----
                    REBOOT yourfilesdesire cr
                 and that's it. To remove an entry---
                    REBOOT cr
                 Simple huh!
    
10.  STRLIB.LIB--The begining of a library, some good stuff.

11.  WUMPUS.PAS/COM/DOC--Nothing need to be said about this
     CAVES               game but it is Pascal 3.0 and also
                         it has Caves that can be added to,
                         so for you game freaks, get hot and
                         put your ideas in some strange
                         caves.
12.  ENTRY.PAS/COM/DOC--Tutorial on how to make external
                         SRC files with examples. Needed by
                         all of us beginners.
13.  PEEK.PAS--A peek and poke in Pascal/Z yet.  Who knows
               you might need it.
14.  POWERI.PAS/REL/COM--A demo, but useful program for 
                         powers of numbers.
15.  RDR.PAS--A Alpha-numeric numbers conversion program.
