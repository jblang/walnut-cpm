		----DU.ASM----
OVERVIEW:
	Originally written to reconstruct erased directories,
or directories where info was overlaid.  Thus allows dumping,
by group, track, sector, filename, etc. and patching.  Allows
ascii or hex scan of the disk.  Maps the location of files
on the disk by group.  You should know the format of a CP/M
disk if you're going to diddle with DU.

USAGE:
	DU.ASM provides an overview of the file.  DU has a
built in help function ? which tells the format of all
commands.

DEPENDENCIES:
	"Standard CP/M 8" disks" - i.e. 77 tracks,
directory at track 2.  Standard CP/M scramble factor
(but could be changed in the .ASM file) etc.  It also works
on such disks as Northstar CP/M 1.4 which the excellent
Lifeboat BIOS make "look" like full sized disks in terms of
sector/track etc.
