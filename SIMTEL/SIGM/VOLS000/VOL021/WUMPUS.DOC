The Wumpus lives in a cave of 20 rooms.  Each room has 3 tunnels leading 
to other rooms.  There are several caves that you can play in.  With only a
small change in the program, you can even invent you own cave!
 
Hazards:
 
Bottomless Pits - Two rooms have bottomless pits in them.  If you go there,  
you fall into the pit and lose!
 
Super Bats - Two rooms have super bats.  If you go there, a bat grabs you and 
takes to some other room at random.  (which mignt be troublesome)
 
Wumpus:
 
The Wumpus is not bothered by the hazards (he has sucker feet and is too 
big for a super bat to lift).  Usually he is asleep.
Two things wake him up:
$pause
 
 

    your entering his room or your shooting an arrow.
 
 If the Wumpus wakes he moves (p=.75) one room or stays still (p=.25).  
 After that, if he is where you are, he eats you up and you lose!
 
 You:
 
 Each turn you can move or shoot a crooked arrow.
 
Moving:		You can go one room (thru one tunnel).
 
Arrows:
	You have 5 arrow.  You lose when you run out.
  Each arrow can go from 1 to 5 rooms.  You aim by telling the computer 
  the room numbers you want the arrow to go to.  If the arrow can't go
  that way (ie. no tunnel) it moves at random to the next room.  If the
  arrow hits the Wumpus, you win.  If the arrow hits you, you lose.

Warnings:
 
When you are one room away from the Wumpus or a hazard, the cumputer says:
 
 Wumpus - 'I smell a Wumpus'
 Bat    - 'Bats nearby'
 Pit    - 'I feel a draft'
$pause
 
Caves:
 
All caves have have 20 rooms and 3 tunnels leading from one room
to other rooms.  The caves are: 
 
 
 0 - Dodecahedron 
 The rooms of this cave are on a 12-sided object, each forming a pentagon.
 The rooms are at the corners of the pentagons.  Each room has tunnels that 
 lead to 3 other rooms.  
 
 1 - Mobius Strip
 This cave is two rooms wide and 10 rooms around (like a belt).  You will 
 notice that there is a half twist somewhere.
 
 2 - String of Beads
 Five beads in a circle.  Each bead is a diamond with a virtical cross-
 bar.  The right and left corners lead to neighboring beads. (This one is 
 difficult to play)

 3 - Toroidal Hex Network
 Imagine a hex tile floor.  Take a rectangle with 20 points (inter-
 sections) inside (4 X 4).  Join right and left sides to make a cylinder.
 Then join top and bottom to form a torus (doughnut).  Have fun imagining
 this one!
 
 Caves 0-3 are regular in the sense that each room goes to three other rooms
 and each tunnel allows two-way traffic.  Caves 4 and 5 do not have these
 properties.
 
 4 - Dendrite with Degeneracies
 Pull a plant from the ground.  The roots and branches form a Dendrite.
 There are no looping paths.  Degeneracy means that some rooms connect to
 themselves and some rooms have more than one tunnel to the same other room.
 
 5 - One Way Latice
 Here all tunnels go one way only.  To return to the room you just left,
 you must go all the way around the cave (only 5 moves).
 
 GOOD LUCK - HAPPY WUMPUS HUNTING!
