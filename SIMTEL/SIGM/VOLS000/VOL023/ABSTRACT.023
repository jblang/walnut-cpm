1® EXPO.PAS/COÍ          Hå  wanteä á benchmarë prograí  sï  hå 
                         wrote this. It is a good Demo on the use
                         of exponents.
2. COMPARE.DOC           Ken feels, as I do, that credit should
                         be given when due. On disk#1 there is a
                         UCSD program called Compare that needed
                         to be converted to Pascal/Z. I didn't
                         receive the Doc file with the program
                         but Ken found it.So here it is and the
                         proper credits are included.

     This next large group was submitted by Scott Custin of
Washington,DC.

3®   DISASMB.DOÃ-----Reaä thió firsô becauså therå arå á loô  oæ 
     small program associated with this disassembler. It is in
     MICROSOFT Basic,Version 5.1 which I would not normally use
     but since it does disassemble TDL plus Z80 plus 8080 plus
     8085 I figured someone, somewhere would be tickled to get
     this.

8085      LST            8085      TAB            XREF      BAS
ZILOG     LST            ZILOG     TAB            XREF      SUB
INTEL     LST            INTEL     TAB            TDL       LST
TDL       TAB            LST8085   BAS            LSTINTEL  BAS
LSTTDL    BAS            LSTZILOG  BAS            TAB8085   BAS
TABINTEL  BAS            TABTDL    BAS            TABZILOG  BAS
DISASMB   BAS            

4.   DATE.DOC-----Again, read this first since Scott has included
     several programs, all dealing with dates. These routines 
     treat a date as one of a series of consecutive integers.
     The concept is similar to Julian dates, used by a number of
     "BIG" computer programs, and has a number of advantages over
     storing the month, day and year separately.

PROMT     LIB            MAKEDATE  LIB            RMAKEDA  LIB
BRKDATE   LIB            DASTRLON  LIB            DASTRSH  LIB
DASTRFIX  LIB            DATE      PAS            DATEFUNC LIBŠ
5.  MISC.DOC-----Yep, read this first. Scott tossed in some odds
     and ends. You have to give Scott credit, he sure has been
     creative. Keep this up folks, and we will have a excellent
     LIBRARY.

GETINT    LIB            CAPCHAR   LIB            PADSTR   LIB
CAPSTR    LIB            DEPAD     LIB            STRVAL   LIB

6.  HANOI COM/PAS        I included this not for its game value
                         but it is an excellent Demo on recursive
                         procedures. If you can see how this works
                         (its deep) you'll certainly understand
                         local versus global variables.
     
7.  DIS.ASM/DOC          This was given to me for our TDL use.
                         However, the three or four assemblers
                         I had available would not assemble it
                         without massive errors. So if anyone
                         does make a COM file that works good
                         be sure and send me a copy. Let me
                         know what assembler you used also.

8.  CONFER.PAS/COM       Just to show you how long Ray has been
                         chipping away at Pascal/Z, I thought
                         I would include this old one.  It 
                         does have some useful ideas and can
                         be used as is. It sets up a schedule
                         for a conference.
