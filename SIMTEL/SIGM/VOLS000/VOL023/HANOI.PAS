:		HANOI PROGRAM
:
:	This one came in and got mixed up with a bunch
:  of other programs and since it did not have a comment
:  section I don't know who to give credit to.  So if
:  anyone recognizes his own style, drop me a line and
:  I will update this spot to give you proper credit.
:	 I included it because it is a excellent example
:  of recursive procedures.  It nests deeply and demon-
:  strates how local versus global variable are keep
:  separate.
