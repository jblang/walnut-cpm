Z-80/8080 TDL BASED DISASSEMBLER

The program will disassemble any Z-80 or 8080 object program
and reconstruct a TDL assembly format compatible source file
on the console or disk. The object file resides in memory at
any location up to the starting address of the disassembler.
Binary files may  be loaded  at any time and  utilities are
provided to manipulate and examine loaded files. Disassembly
may be effected  in multi-segment passes,  with each segment
starting at any location  and ending at  any location within
the range  0000-ORIGIN.  The latter  may or  may not  be the
execution locations   of   the  object   program.  For  each
segment/pass, run-time options may be specified as follows:

	[a] Use the  symbol table  for the label
	field and address field (see option g)

	[b] Do not  initialize the  symbol table
	nor the disk  source file  (see option i
	for  exception).  Use   this  option  to
	append entries to  the symbol  table and
	new lines to the disk file.

	[c] Build symbol  table using  the Lxxxx
	format    for     extended     reference
	instructions. (see options  a and  g for
	execptions)

	[d] Generate labels Lxxxx instead of the
	default HEX values xxxxH.

	[e] Generate ASCII  characters in quotes
	depending on option  f.  If option f  is
	true,  all  printable  ASCII  characters
	will be placed  in quotes  following the
	.Byte pseudo  opcode.  If  option  f  is
	false, all two operand instructions with
	data will  be followed  as a  comment by
	the quoted ASCII character corresponding
	to the data.

	[f] Generate .BYTE pseudo opcode instead
	of  default  assembly   code.  Use  this
	option   for   proper   disassembly   of
	segments consisting of  tables and ASCII
	strings.

	[g] Normally the operands  of LXI instr.
	are treated as  2 byte  data rather than
	as an address.  Use this  option to over
	ride this  default.  If  this  option is
	selected, the  2  byte  operand  of  LXI
	instructions will be  used to  build the
	symbol table and  if already  there, the
	symbol entries will be  used in place of
	the default HEX format.

	[h] Write/Build  a  reconstructed SOURCE
	FILE in disk and  in a compatible format
	ready for re-assembly  by the  TDL MACRO
	RELOCATING ASSEMBLER. If the source file
	is new, you  will  be  prompted  for the
	filename.

	[i] Restart the disk  file regardless of
	option b. Use  this option  to over ride
	the APPEND mode  without  affect  on the
	specified action on the symbol table.

	[j] Close the source  file at the normal
	termination of this segment/pass.

	[k] Suppress  console  output.  Use this
	option  during  symbol   table  building
	pasess to expedite disassembly.

ALL OPTION ARE SELECTED  WITH THE 'O'   COMMAND. ALL OPTIONS
ARE INITIALIZED OFF. EACH TIME THE 'O'  COMMAND IS USED, ALL
DESIRED OPTIONS MUST  BE SELECTED  SINCE THE  COMMAND RESETS
EACH OPTION.

The  following   describes   the   command   mode   of   the
disassembler.  All line   editing   features   of   CPM  are
available in the command  mode except Control-C.  DO NOT USE
CONTROL-C TO RETURN TO CPM.

RUBOUT		delete and echo the last character typed

ctl-U		delete entire line

ctl-X		(same as ctl-U)

ctl-R		retype current line

ctl-E		physical end of line

ctl-S		stop the console output temporalily

D aaaa,bbbb	Disassemble memory from start address aaaa to
		end address bbbb

R drive:file	Read a binary file into memory. All files must
		have a 'COM' extension. Files are loaded at
		start address 100H and the length of the file
		will be displayed at the console.

O a,b,c,...	Set runtime options. All options are reset
		with this command and selectively set.

Q		Quit session and return to CPM. The number of
		current symbol table entries is displayed.

M aaaa,bbbb,cccc	Move memory starting at aaaa and 
			ending at bbbb address cccc.

H aaaa,bbbb	Hex math. The sum and difference will be
		displayed.

S aaaa,bbbb	Show memory in HEX.

T aaaa,bbbb	Type memory in ASCII.

C		Close source file. Use this command when write
		errors occur or end of medium.

	---ALL PARAMETERS ARE IN HEX ---
