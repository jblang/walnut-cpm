        DATE.COM usage:
 
                  If  you are running under MP/M, skip the rest of
                  this paragraph.  If you are running under  CP/M,
                  a special program may be used to create a "date"
                  file.   The  68000  assembler will use this date
                  file to date the listing file which it produces.
                  To run the program, enter "DATE".   The  program
                  will  provide the necessary prompting to produce
                  an empty file  of  the  form  "MM/DD/YY.DAT"  on
                  drive  A  under user 0.  Now use the DIR command
                  to see the date in the directory.
