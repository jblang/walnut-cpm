1.  Chuck Weingart, of Chicago has donated some of his efforts again.
    This program started out several years ago as Combine but several
    people have improved upon it and finally Chuck felt motivated 
    enough to polish and rename it. Basically it will combine multiple
    small files into one large file. The method it uses also allows
    it to be used as a Submit replacement.

	CCT.COM/ASM/HEX

2.  Steve Oualline, of Fort Worth came up with something different.
    Cross orginally came from the University of Hamburg. It is commented
    in German and came from the Dec-10 environment. Cross will take
    a Pascal program, indent it and produce a cross reference of the
    indented copy. It will also put a line number and some annotations
    on the left side of your file. This very well could be a help in
    debugging since the annotations tell you (by number) were a BEGIN
    is and its END. It also provides a cross-reference file sent to
    IO of your choice.

	CROSS.COM/DOC/PAS/SUB		BLOCK.PAS
	INIT.PAS			INSYM.PAS
	SIZE.SRC

3.  John Wilson, of Synapse Assoc, wrote PURGE as an utility for use
    with Pascal/Z and other compilers. It will erase the numerous
    files which are no longer needed after a successful compilation.
    It never erases the COM or PAS but you have choices over other file
    types.  Although John wrote PURGE with the H19 terminal in mind,
    the source is included so that you can patch your own terminal in
    very easily.

	PURGE.COM/DOC/MAC		M80LIB00.MAC
	MACRO.LIB			

4.  Bill Jhnsn, of Pueblo,Col needed a floating point package and
    had to settle for writing one himself. He has included a demo
    program to get you started.
