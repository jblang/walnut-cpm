
	This disk contains the following files, as described briefly
here:


1:	ZXART.DOC  This is the original text of the article which app-
	eared in the August, 1980 edition of Dr. Dobb's Journal.

2:	ZXTABx.DOC  These tables are also part of the text for the ar-
	ticle.  ** NOTE:  Where addresses appear in these tables, they
	pertain to a 32K byte system with standard 512 byte CBIOS. For
	any other size system loaded just below CBIOS as described, the
	first two digits of these addresses will be {CBIOS page minus
	four}. I.E. for standard 32K, CBIOS page is 7EH. Subtract four
	and the result is 7AH.

3:	ZXHINTS.DOC  A little additional useful information on loading
	and running ZX65.

4:	ZX65R.ZSM  The Z80 source code for the interpreter. Version 2.1
	is relocatable and must be linked with ZXLDR following assembly.

5:	ZXLDR.ZSM  Source code for the system 'booter.' CP/M loads ZX65R
	normally into the bottom of the TPA at 100H. ZXLDR finds CBIOS,
	calculates and inserts the relocation offsets, and then boots
	ZX65 up to high memory and jumps to it.  Version 2.1 must be lin-
	ked with ZX65R following assembly for this to work.

6:	ZX65R/XX.PRN and ZXLDR/XX.PRN  This is the listing output of the
	assembler, showing system memory locations PRIOR TO RELOCATION.

7:	ZX65.COM  Getting down to business...you should be able to
	run this file immediately simply by typing 'ZX65' to the
	CP/M prompt.
