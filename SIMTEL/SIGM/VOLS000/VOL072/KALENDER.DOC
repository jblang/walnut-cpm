Kalender is a calender-generating program. It accepts any years between
1583 and 3000, and generates a calender in the form of 

              JAN        FEB        MARCH
              APRIL      MAY        JUNE     etc.

The generated calenders are written to B:CALENDER.TXT.

If anyone examines the code of Kalender and wondrs why it is not so
readable, it is because the variables are all German words.
