(* NewDisc performs the introduction of a new disc into		*)
(* the Disc Catalog System. This System is described, and is    *)
(* available, on PASCAL Z Disc #9.				*)
(*  The Catalog System was originally authored by Ward		*)
(* Christenson of CP/M Users Group.				*)
(*								*)
(*	In the following description, the word 'Catalog'   is   *)
(* used to refer to the Name part of a Disc Identification file	*)
(* where the Disc Identification file has a name of the form	*)
(*								*)
(*		<-Name.Serial Number>				*)
(*								*)
(*								*)
(*								*)
(*								*)
(*								*)
(*								*)
(* The general method of operation is as follows		*)
(*								*)
(*	1.0 MAST.CAT is read and a table of the current	used	*)
(*	    Disc Serial Numbers and their Categories is built.	*)
(*								*)
(*	2.0 The Categories, together with 'New Category' and	*)
(*	    NRS are presented to the User who can choose        *)
(*             a) to use an existing Category, or		*)
(*	       b) to use a new Category, or			*)
(*	       c) to request a display of the allocated Serial	*)
(*	          numbers.	This mode will return to main   *)
(*		  menu selection after examination		*)
(*								*)
(*	3.0 The next available Serial Number is selected and a 	*)
(*	    file of the form					*)
(*		<-category Name.Serial Number>			*)
(*	    is written to the disc in Drive B.			*)
(*								*)
(*	4.0 The Program cycles until all initialising is 	*)
(*	    completed.						*)
(*								*)
(*								*)
(*								*)
(*    	Note:  This Program uses the Serial Number '0' to mean	*)
(*	       'Undefined'. Therefore this program will not	*)
(*		work if your current MAST.CAT has entries for	*)
(*		Serial Number 0.				*)
