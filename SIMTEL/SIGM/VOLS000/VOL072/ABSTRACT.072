                         George wrote this utility to work with
                         Ward Christensen's Catalog program. It
                         keeps track of the allocated Serial #'s
                         and catagories.It'll give you a menu of
                         the catagories already in use and when
                         you choose a catagory, it will assign a
                         serial number for you. The next step is
                         to lock those programs togeather so 
                         it'll do everything for you.

2.   I personally prefer to include our own donations in our user
     grouğ anä leavå otheò donationó tï theiò respectivå groups. 
     Buô  É  havå receiveä enougè requestó bù ouò owî memberó  sï 
     thaô  É havå continueä tï searcè foò thoså  utilitieó  whicè 
     will benifit us. Chuck Weingart was kind enough to recomend
     the following programs from CPM user group #78.
     
     /.COM,.ASM     John Kodis wrote this to read a command line
                    whicè    maù    contaiî    severaì    prograí 
                    invocations.Á  $$$.SUÂ  filå  ió  builô  witè 
                    these commands. This file is then executed.
     FMAP.COM       An update by Ward Christensen, type "FMAP H"
                    for help.
     IF.COM         Allows you to conditionally abort or continue
                    a SUBMIT,depending upon whether a file exists
                    or not.
     NOTATE.COM/ASM This is my favorite. This program is used to
                    add comments to .ASM files which have sparse
                    comments. It types the file, and on any line
                    whicè  doeó  noô havå á comment¬  printó  thå 
                    line, a tab, a semicolon, then awaits input.
                    If you press return, the line is left,without
                    the TAB. Anything you type will be added to Š                    the line.
     XREFPRN.COM/ASM--Just type "XREFPRN filename.PRN" and it'll
                    go directly to the CP/M LIST device.
     REPEAT.COM/DOC This will repeat a .SUB file "nn" times.

     this area (he'll still keep in touch) and donated these
     as his going away present. Warren doesn't garantee any of
     these since he was developing them as time permitted. But
     theù  arå á startinç poinô anä whï knows¬  theù maù bå  jusô 
     thå  thinç yoõ need®   É thinë Warreî starteä witè MT«  froí 
     the look of some of these programs. But he got converted to
     Pascal/Z.
       Here is a brief description of each file:

	ACOUSTIC.PAS	- A set of routines that are functionally eq-
			  uivalent to those found in DCMODEM.PAS.
			  These are intended to allow someone without
			  a D.C. Hayes Modem to use the same software
			  as someone who does use one.  It only requires
			  linking in this set of routines instead of
			  DCMODEM, the routines have the same interfaces.
	CIRCQUE.PAS	- A couple of routines that demonstrate how to
			  handle a circular queue, very good for I/O
			  buffering.
	CRT.PAS		- A set of routines for doing the most common
			  types of functions to a CRT type terminal,
			  set up for a Televideo 912/920 but easily
			  modifiable to other brands.  These routines
			  are used extensively by the rest of the disk.
	CLOCK.PAS	- A set of routines for dealing with an OKI
			  MSM5382 clock chip.  Includes many functions 
			  for writing the time and date to any file in
			  a standard format.
	DCMODEM.PAS	- A set of routines for utilizing the functions of
			  the D.C. Hayes modem board.  Includes Ring detect,
			  Carrier Detect, Dialing, Originate/Answer modes,
			  110/300 baud.
	PARMS.PAS	- Written specifically for Pascal Z these routines
			  do most of the work of parsing an input string.
			  The user must specify which characters are
			  'slough' characters (i.e. ignored, when found
			  between parameters) such as blanks or commas,
			  and which characters are delimiters (e.g. commas,
			  periods or also blanks).
	PAY.PAS		- This program will calculate monthly mortgage
			  payments.
	TERMINAL.PAS	- This program will use either DCMODEM.PAS or 
			  ACOUSTIC.PAS and will serve as a dumb terminal.
			  It can switch between Full and Half duplex, and
			  can display control characters coming down the
			  line at you.
	UTILITY.PAS	- Currently only has one routine, a lower to upper
			  case function.

                         already). It is simple but I like it and
                         it'll be a good seed program to do some-

     decided to start customizing our CPM we naturally asked him
     what he can do for us and this is the start of it. He has
     disassembled CPM into Z80 code and we are having classes on
     just how it is working. We'll be doing BDOS next.

               a excellent job however.
