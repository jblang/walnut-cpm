                    REPEAT.DOC

    Repeat a .SUB file "nn" times.  Used in two "phases":
(1) type "REPEAT nn" to set things up (just stores a count
    at 8.
(2) Place "REPEAT" in your .SUB file immediately before a
    line re-submitting the original file.
EX:

First, type

	REPEAT 5

Then have your submit file be:
	blah
	blah
	blah
	repeat
	submit foo

When repeat executes with no operands, it decrements the
count at 8, and if 0, erases $$$.SUB.
