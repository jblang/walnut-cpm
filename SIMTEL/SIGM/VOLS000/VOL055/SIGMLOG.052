	Documentation for CATALIST.BAS, SCATPAD.BAS and UN.COM

CATALIST.BAS -  Is used to produce a listing of the contents of
	the latest CPMUG and SIG/M volumes.  It reads in SCATS,
	which is a modified version of MAST.CAT ( MAST.CAT is
	produced by FMAP.COM  and UCAT.COM).  The modifications
	were:
	1>  Exclusion filenames (those between parentheses)
	    were deleted - parentheses too.
	2>  Volume filenames were deleted.  It's just redundant
	    information, since -CATALOG.xxx or -SIGMLOG.xxx
	    are assumed to exist (or there would be no files
	    of the form 'filename.ext, ????LOG.xxx'.
	3>  A working copy was made using PIP.COM using the [z]
	    option, since some programs were inadvertantly
	    distributed with CP/M file attributes which set
	    some bits in the filenames that prevent them from
	    being properly sorted.
	4>  It was then sorted in ascending sequence on all
	    fields in the following order:  1, 2, 4, 3.

	If CATALIST.BAS/COM is run, the listing file will be
	saved on disk and may be printed when convenient.  If
	you want a listing in your own SCATalogical order, it
	will be necessary to sort SCAT.  Since a good number of
	those wishing to do so will have a sort program which
	handles only fixed length records, a request was made
	that a simple program be included which will modify
	SCAT for use by those sort programs. This program is
	known as...

SCATPAD.BAS - A quick and dirty program (minimal error checks)
	which will modify a file in one of two ways.

	1>  Make all records fixed length by padding spaces
	    onto the end of each line. (This extends the size
	    of the last field only).
	2>  Make all fields fixed length by padding them with
	    spaces.  Note that while the input file seperated
	    the fields with commas, the output will not have
	    any if you so specify. Just make sure that they are
	    inserted before using CATALIST.  If field lengths
	    are stated to be larger the the max. possible, then
	    the files could look as follows:


	SCAT				    OUTPUT

	/,DOC,CATALOG,040        |   /        DOC CATALOG  040
	15/PUZ,ASC,CATALOG,013   |   15/PUZ   ASC CATALOG  013
	1500,ASC,CATALOG,013     |   1500     ASC CATALOG  013
	1CHECK,BAS,CATALOG,054   |   1CHECK   BAS CATALOG  054

	    If the field lengths are stated as being the true
	    maximum, then the result will look like this:

	SCAT					OUTPUT

	21,ASC,CATALOG,005	|	21      ASCCATALOG005
	21BIOS,ASM,SIGMLOG,017	|	21BIOS  ASMSIGMLOG017
	21BIOS,ASM,CATALOG,069	|	21BIOS  ASMCATALOG069
	21BIOS,DOC,SIGMLOG,017	|	21BIOS  DOCSIGMLOG017

	    If commas were specified with field lengths of
	    8, 3, 7, and 3 bytes, the result will appear as:

	21BIOS,DOC,SIGMLOG,017   |   21BIOS  ,DOC,SIGMLOG,017
	21BIOS,DOC,CATALOG,069   |   21BIOS  ,DOC,CATALOG,069
	21BOOT,ASM,SIGMLOG,017   |   21BOOT  ,ASM,SIGMLOG,017
	21BOOT,ASM,CATALOG,069   |   21BOOT  ,ASM,CATALOG,069


	If you would like to know where to obtain information
	on how to use Ward Christenson's catalog programs, just
	use them like so...
	Type 'CAT CAT??.*' or 'CAT FMAP??.*' and watch the tube.

UN.COM  -   An updated version of the one submitted to the CPMUG
	    several months ago.  Use it to recover your Basic-80
	   programs which were saved with the 'P'rotect option.
	   It is self documenting if you can figure out how, and
	   running it can be a real 'Adventure'.  This version
	   works with all version 5.xx MBASICS up to 5.21, but
	   unfortunately, not with Heath's CP/M.


***** Notes *****
		CATALIST was timed using 8" drives, double
	    density, single sided.  The source file, SCAT
	    was kept in drive A:, and the output file was
	    always written to a empty disk in drive B:. The
	    interpreter took 12 minutes to finish, while the
	    compiled program made it in 2:50.  However...
	    the demo program supplied for UN.COM (TestProt.BAS)
	    runs much slower when compiled.
		This will be a do-it-yourself disk for all of
	    you that want the listing that CATALIST.BAS
	    produces.  In a previous life, this disk was known
	    as SIGM Volume 12.  Unlike #12, this disk has no
	    room for the listing, but by the time you read this
	    it should be available as part of the NYACC Catalog
	    of Public Domain Software (Book #2).
