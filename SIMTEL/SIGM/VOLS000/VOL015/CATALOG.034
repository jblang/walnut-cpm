**   .SAM files are not printable due to control-Z at their
start, so IDUMP was included on this disk "for the curious".
It is an hex-ascii interpreted file dump program.



     The SAM76 language deals mainly with the manipulation of
text, which contain expressions, scripts and procedures written
by the user.  They can contain both character strings and
program instructions.  SAM76 is an interactive, surprisingly
powerful language, which appears to be good for gaming and
artificial intelligence applications.  Powerful, recursive
macros or procedures may be constructed. It is a language
which encourages intellectual juggling.
