VOLUME 13

BASIC-E/CBASIC AND MICROSOFT BASIC PROGRAMS

A VERY MIXED BUNCH.  ZOSO LAMENTS ABOUT THE
QUALITY IN HIS CHRISTMAS PLAY, COMPLETE WITH GREEK
CHORUS.  THIS DISKETTE IS A MUST FOR ANYONE WHO
MUST HAVE A COPY OF EVERYTHING.  UNFORTUNATELY
A FEW JEWELS HERE MAY BE MISSED BECAUSE OF THE
COMPANY IT KEEPS IN THIS VOLUME

THE *.ASC ARE MICROSOFT, THE *.BAS WILL (SOMETIMES)
COMPILE ON BASIC-E/CBASIC.  MANY ARE COMPATIBLE.  ALL
CAN BE SWITCHED WITH SYNTACTICAL SYNCHRONIZATION (WHO
SAID THAT??) (MY LIPS DIDN'T MOVE)

AND NOW ON TO THE SOFTWARE REVIEW...


BIORYME.BAS
APPEARS TO BE A SINE WAVE SIMULATOR CAPABLE OF CONTROLLING THREE OF THE
LITTLE MONSTERS... THERE APPEARS TO BE SOME LINES SUGGESTING INPUT/OUTPUT.
MIGHT BE INTERFACEABLE TO A CONSOLE OR LIST DEVICE. THIS IS NOT THAT WONDERFUL
IMPROVEMENT YOU MIGHT HAVE BEEN EXPECTING. WOE BE UNTO THOSE WHO TRY TO FEED
THIS TO ANY OF YOUR COMPILER-BASICS; [TRY MITS BASIC... IF YOU MUST].
	(P.S. THIS APPEARS TO BE A MITS BASIC PROGRAM AFTER FAULTY
	RECOVERY THROUGH A LIST32 PROGRAM OF SOME ILK.  AFTER ADDING
	A FEW MISSING PARENTHESES, THIS PROGRAM PERFORMS QUITE WELL
	AS A MICROSOFT [I.E. TYPE.ASC] PROGRAM AND HAS BEEN RE-
	NAMED AS SUCH.  SHAME ON ZOSO FOR NOT PERSEVERING!!! A.R.G)
SHAME ON ZOSO, INDEED !!! RUN THIS TURKEY AND DECIDE FOR YOURSELVES !!! Z.

BAGELS3.BAS
IF YOU RECALL, LAST TIME THERE WERE TWO VERSIONS OF THIS GAME, AND I REALLY
LIKED THEM BOTH. SAME APPLIES HERE!!! KEEP ALL THREE VERSIONS! USE THEM ALL!
THEY ARE ALL GOOD, AND EACH HAS ITS OWN SPECIAL 'STYLE'. REALLY GOOD !!

BLACKJAC.BAS
I HAVE MIXED FEELINGS ABOUT THIS ONE. IT IS AN EXCELLENT!!!! BLACKJACK
SIMULATOR, HOWEVER THE GRAPHIC OUTPUT IS AWKWARD AND CONFUSING. TIED
FOR WINNER THIS TIME AROUND. WHY DOESN'T SOMEONE GET THIS TO 'PRETTY-PRINT'
AND SEND IT TO TONY.

DICE.BAS
THIS IS A VERY GOOD CRAPS SIMULATOR. THE IDENTICAL COMMENTS APPLY TO THIS
AS TO BLACKJAC.BAS EXCEPT THIS ONE ISN'T TIED FOR WINNER. SEND THOSE
GRAPHIC UPGRADES TO TONY.

ROCKET.BAS [NAMED SOMETHING ELSE FOR LAST RELEASE]
YOU'VE SEEN THIS BEFORE, BELIEVE ME ! THIS ISN'T AS GOOD AS THE EARLIER ONE
(FROM FIRST DISTRIBUTION), AND FURTHERMORE IT EXHIBITS THE ALARMING TREND
OF BEING ACCEPTABLE ONLY TO CERTAIN SPECIAL COMPILER/RUN VERSIONS. SELL THIS,
AND THEN SELL THE PURCHASER THE EARLIER ONE AS A COSTLY UPGRADE.

CONVERT.BAS
THE SUSPENSE IS OVER !! THIS IS THE CO-WINNER. THIS ALLOWS C-BASIC USERS TO
TAKE A FULLY LINE-NUMBERED PROGRAM, AND GET RID OF ALL THE UNNECESSARY LINE
NUMBERS. AS YOU C-BASIC SORTS MAY HAVE INFERRED, I AM NOT REALLY YOUR MOST
ARDENT DISCIPLE; YET THIS IS A POWERFUL SOFTWARE ITEM FOR YOU, IT WORKS,
AND IT IS CLEVER !
	(P.S. DON'T BOTHER TO TRY IT ON A BASIC-E SET OF COMPILER AND
	RUN-TIME INTERPRETER.  IN FACT, SINCE C-BASIC DOES'T ACTUALLY
	OBJECT TO EXTRA LINE NUMBERS, WHY TRY IT AT ALL???. A.R.G)
ANSWER - TO FURTHER OBFUSCATE PROGRAMS WRITTEN IN THAT LANGUAGE... Z.

WUMPAS.BAS
LAST TIME ROUND I URGED THE GUILLOTINING OF THE PERPETRATOR OF SOME PROGRAM
CALLED WUMPUS.BAS... TO THE CONTRIBUTER: IF IT LOOKS LIKE A DOG, SMELLS LIKE
A DOG AND BARKS LIKE A DOG...WHAT NEXT ? WUMPIS.BAS, WUMPOS.BAS...OH GOD !!!
DON'T ANYONE DARE SEND ME ANY WUMPES.BAS EITHER. THIS DOES HAVE ONE MAJOR
ENHANCEMENT OVER THE LAST 'WUMPUS' I DIDN'T LIKE: THIS ONE DOESN'T WORK RIGHT.
A GOOD PROJECT FOR THE TIME YOU HAVE TO SPEND IN RENO WAITING FOR YOUR DIVORCE
TO FINALLY HAPPEN.

KINGDOM.BAS
I'VE TRIED THIS COMPILER-SENSITIVE ITEM A FEW TIMES. MERCIFULLY THE GAMES
HAVE BEEN SHORT. YOU HOLD TOTAL SWAY OVER [LOYAL] SUBJECTS, ALLOCATE YOUR
RESOURCES, AND DECIDE HOW TO BEST SPEND THE COIN OF THE REALM, 'RALLODS',
[FIGURE THAT ONE OUT YOU CRYPTOGRAPHIC-WHIZZES]. THE APPARENT MASTERY OF THIS
GAME INVOLVES EMBEZZLING ALL THE 'RALLODS' YOU CAN, AND ALLOWING ALL OF YOUR
SUBJECTS TO PERISH BEFORE THEY CAN DISCOVER YOUR AVARICE.

SWARMS.BAS
THE ATTACK OF THE KILLER BEES... GET ME MY HEART MEDICINE... I GROW FAINT...!!
THIS ONE DIDN'T WORK EITHER, BUT IT LOOKED LIKE IT MIGHT BE GOOD, SO I REWROTE
IT A BIT FOR MICROSOFT DISK BASIC. MAYBE, IF YOU SEE A FILE SWARMS2.ASC, I'LL
HAVE DECIDED TO INCLUDE IT. THIS IS A VERY!! COMPREHENSIVE GAME WITH A LOT OF
OPTIONS. IT QUICKLY BECOMES CONFUSING AND BORING !!!  THE PSYCHOLOGISTS
AMONGST YOU WILL FIND THIS GAME A MOST INTERESTING DIAGNOSTIC TOOL!! WHEN I GOT
THIS ONE RUNNING, ABOUT A DOZEN PEOPLE TRIED IT... EVERY SINGLE ONE, BY THE
SECOND ATTEMPT, DID NOTHING BUT 'NUKE' UNEVACUATED AMERICAN CITIES, MYSELF IN-
CLUDED. I THINK, IN FAIRNESS, HUMAN NATURE IS LESS AT FAULT THAN THIS MONUMENT
TO FUTILITY... REMEMBER THAT PINBALL MACHINE WHICH YIELDED A FREE GAME EVERY
THOUSAND TRIES...?  THIS GAME OFFERS THE SAME LIKELIHOOD OF VICTORY AS THAT
VERY SAME MACHINE WITH ONLY 2 BALLS AND INOPERATIVE FLIPPERS... THE 'STING' ?

RUSSIAN.BAS
WHEN WILL YOU PARENTAL TYPES LEARN... UNLESS YOU TEACH YOUR 'RETARDATE' TO
SIGN HIS PROGRAMS WITH SOMETHING CUTE LIKE 'LITTLE JOHNNY DOE AGE 7 1/2',
SOMEBODY MAY MISTAKENLY THINK THAT YOU SUBMITTED THEM. YOU WOULDN'T WANT
THAT TO HAPPEN, WOULD YOU ?  FOR THE RECORD, THIS IS RUSSIAN-ROULETTE: THE ONE
YOU'VE ALWAYS AVOIDED.  THE OUTPUT OF THIS OPUS-MAGNUS CONSISTS OF THE WORDS,
'CLICK' AND 'POW'. THE LATTER INDICATES THAT YOUR BRAINS HAVE BEEN SPATTERED
ACROSS THAT PAYROLL PROGRAM YOU WERE PREPARING FOR THE ESKIMO FREEZER SALESMAN.
I AM WRITING THIS A WEEK BEFORE CHRISTMAS, BUT I CANNOT REFRAIN FROM WISHING
THAT THE AUTHOR HAD DEBUGGED THIS ITEM WITH A [REAL] .357 MAGNUM. BY THE WAY,
IF YOU MUST PLAY THIS (AND I EARNESTLY HOPE YOU DON'T), YOU WILL MOST LIKELY BE
RISKING YOUR LIFE WITH A SINGLE-SHOT ANTIQUE OR A SEVEN SHOT 'HYBRID' GUN. IT
SEEMS THAT THE CALL TO RND (RANDOM-NUMBER) SEVERELY AFFECTS THE OTHER MISTAKES
IN THIS PROGRAM. I'M NEW AT THIS BUSINESS, BUT I HOPE TO GAIN YOUR CONFIDENCE
BY CALLING THEM AS I SEE THEM,... THIS IS THE VERY WORST PROGRAM THAT I HAVE
EVER SEEN !!! I HAVE NEVER ELIMINATED ALL COPIES OF A FILE FROM MY ARCHIVES
BEFORE. THIS TIME, I JUST MIGHT...CLICK-CLICK-POW !!!

TRAP.BAS
THE OBJECT OF THIS GAME IS TO TRAP A [RANDOM] NUMBER FROM 1 TO 100 BETWEEN
TWO ADJOINING NUMBERS IN SIX OR LESS TRYS. FOR EXAMPLE, IF THE SECRET NUMBER
IS 46 THEN THE WINNING 'MOVE' WOULD BE: 45,47. THIS GAME IS SIMPLE, BUT AN
HONEST EFFORT WHICH IS FUN TO PLAY. ALSO, IT COMPILED WITHOUT ERRORS WHICH
MAKES IT A 'RARA AVIS' FOR THIS GROUP OF PROGRAMS.

CHECKERS.BAS
THIS PLAYS CHECKERS MINUS THE MULTIPLE JUMPS. IT'S A NICE PROGRAM, WELL WRITTEN
ETC... THIS ONE COULD ALSO USE A GRAPHIC TOUCH-UP (SEND 'EM TO TONY).

CHIEF.BAS
REMEMBER THIS...?  YOU THINK OF A NUMBER, PERFORM SOME DUMB ARITHMETIC, AND YOU
ARRIVE AT ANOTHER NUMBER, WHICH YOU REVEAL TO THE CRASHING BORE WHO'S DOING
THIS TO YOU, AND THAT PERSON WILL DEDUCE THE NUMBER YOU STARTED WITH...; WELL
SOMEONE HAS COMPUTERIZED IT ALL AND BLAMED THE POOR INDIANS. I MUST CONFESS
THAT I REFUSED TO RUN THIS OFTEN ENOUGH TO DETERMINE IF IT WORKS OR NOT. THE
GAME(?) ENDS WITH A BIG LIGHTNING BOLT!! PERHAPS IT WOULD BE BEST FOR SOMEONE
TO REMOVE THE ARITHMETIC AND THE INDIAN CHIEF, THEN TO TAKE WHAT'S LEFT AND
RENAME IT 'LITENING.BAS'... BE HONEST, ANONYMOUS AUTHOR, ARE WE EXPECTED TO
USE ANY NUMBER OTHER THAN 22 ONCE WE MASTER THE TRIBAL RULES ?
	(P.S. I TRIED IT, AND IT DOES WORK.  NOT SURE THAT YOU NATIVE
	AMERICANS WILL APPRECIATE THE STEREOTYPE.  I HEAR THAT THIS WAS
	THE MAJOR FUNDING PROJECT BY B.I.A. IN 1977.  A.R.G)

23MATCH.BAS
THIS ONE PLAYS '23-MATCH NIM'. YOU ALWAYS GO FIRST. THE SLY COMPUTER ALWAYS
GOES SECOND. GUESS WHO (OR WHAT) WINS... YAWN !
	(P.S. I DIDN'T EXPERIENCE ZOSO'S PROBLEM, AND FOUND I COULD BEAT
	THE MACHINE 10 TIMES OUT OF TEN.  FOR YOU MATHS TYPES, THE CORRECT
	STRATEGY IS TO LEAVE THE MACHINE TO DEAL WITH A QUANTITY ONE
	GREATER THAT A MULTIPLE OF FOUR - IE START BY TAKING TWO AND
	LEAVING 21 (5*4+1).  A.R.G)

NFL.BAS
AFTER SOME CONSIDERABLE 'TWEAKING', I GOT THIS ONE TO RUN. THIS IS WHAT I GOT:
AN NFL FOOTBALL SIMULATOR. THIS IS HOW IT WORKS... 1) ONE TEAM KICKS OFF.
2) IT'S 'HALFTIME' (YOU'VE GOT TO SEE THIS !!!). 3) THE OTHER TEAM KICKS OFF
(AN 'ON-SIDES' KICK AT THAT). 4) THE GAME IS OVER. SINCE NEITHER KICK WAS RUN
BACK, THE SCORE IS (CORRECTLY) REPORTED AS A 0-0 TIE. MAYBE THIS WON'T ANNOY
SOME OF YOU, BUT IT SURE AS HELL MAKES IT HARD TO ESTABLISH A POINT SPREAD.

BULLSEYE.BAS
EXAMINE THE SOURCE CODE... IF ANY AMONGST YOU GET THIS ONE TO WORK (AS IS)
WITH ANY EXISTING COMPUTER LANGUAGE, YOU ARE NO DOUBT THE 'MESSIAH' SO MANY
HAVE AWAITED. RECALL MY COMMENTS IN-RE 'RUSSIAN ROULETTE'. DILUTE THAT SEN-
TIMENT BY 1/10 OF 1 PERCENT, SO AS TO SPARE ME WRITING MORE ABOUT SUCH TRIVIA.
	(P.S. LOOKS LIKE WE'VE LOST MOST OF THE SOURCE OF THIS ONE.  CAN
	ANYONE LET US SEE WHAT'S MISSING?  A.R.G.)


GIVEN, HOWEVER I MUST NOT NEGLECT TO MENTION THAT THE 'OTHELLO' WHICH ARRIVED
TOO LATE FOR LAST TIME, AND TOO EARLY FOR THIS TIME, IS MAYBE THE BEST OF THE 
LOT,(TRY IT !)(*).  IN AN ATTEMPT TO BROWN-NOSE THE BOSS, IN HOPES OF GETTING
TO BE REVIEWER FOR THAT OTHER 'BASIC', I WILL INCLUDE A GRATUITOUS REVIEW OF
TWO SUCH LAST-MINUTE ITEMS...

1500.ASC
A NICE LITTLE GAME THAT IS RELIABLE ENOUGH TO SERVE AS AN ACTUAL GAMBLING
DEVICE FOR SOME OF US DECADENT NEW-YORKERS. A WINNER !!! THIS GAME (AND THE
OTHER ONE) INCLUDE IN SEVERAL PLACES THE COMMAND:, 'WAIT 0,1,1', IF YOUR
HARDWARE DOES NOT SUPPORT THIS CONSTRUCT, BEST CHANGE THESE, OR NOTHING WILL
WORK... SOME OF YOUR CRT'S WILL NOT BLANK WITH THE COMMAND: 'PRINT CHR$(26)';
THE MOST COMMON FIX IS: 'PRINT CHR$(12)'. A GAME ESSENTIALLY FOR THOSE 4800 +
BAUD CRT'S ONLY.

15/PUZ.ASC
THE FAMOUS '15 PUZZLE', BORING AS EVER, BUT QUITE NICELY WRITTEN. ALL OF THE
TECHNICAL STUFF FROM ABOVE PROGRAM APPLIES HERE ALSO (EXCEPT FOR THIS ONE,
4800 BAUD WOULD BE TOO SLOW)

(*) NOTE: OTHELLO.BAS AND THE COMPREHENSIVE INSTRUCTIONS FOR SAID GAME CAN BE
          FOUND AS FILES 5.14 AND 5.15 RESPECTIVELY, ON VOLUME 5.

        GOOD CHEER, FROM WHAT WE'VE SEEN, A VAST IMPROVEMENT.
