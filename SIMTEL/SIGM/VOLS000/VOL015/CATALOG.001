PRNT	- IS A PRINT UTILITY SOMETHING LIKE TYPE BUT
	WITH PAGINATION AND HEADINGS. IT SHOULD RUN ON
	ANY CONFIGURATION OF CP/M WITH AN I/O DEVICE
	THAT RECOGNIZES A FORM FEED CHARACTER (HEX 0C)
	AS A TOP-OF PAGE COMMAND. THE SYNTAX FOR USING
	PRNT IS:

	PRNT FILENAME.EXT

	PRNT ALSO MAY BE USEFUL TO THOSE WHO NEED AN
	EXAMPLE OF CP/M DISK I/O ACCESS.

PRINT	- IS A PATCHED VERSION BY ARG TO COPE WITH HARDWARE
	THAT DOES NOT RECOGNISE 0CH

TREAD	- IS A PAPER-TAPE TO DISK UTILITY WHICH WILL
	ONLY WORK WITH A TELETYPE HAVING AN AUTOMATIC
	READER. THE TAPES TO BE READ MUST CONTAIN
	CR, LF SEQUENCES PERIODICALLY. THE TAPE MAY
	BE ENDED WITH A CONTROL Z. SYNTAX FOR USING
	THIS PROGRAM IS:

	TREAD FILENAME.EXT

EXAM	- IS A DISK SECTOR EXAMINATION UTILITY FOR A
	SYSTEM EQUIPPED WITH A VDM. ONCE RUNNING
	EXAM WILL ALLOW VISUAL EXAMINATION OF ANY SECTOR ON
	THE DISK (DRIVE 0 ONLY IN THIS VERSION).
	THE CURRENT VERSION WILL ONLY OPERATE IN A 16K
	SYSTEM BUT THAT IS EASILY FIXED. THE COMMANDS 
	TO EXAM ARE:
	+  =	READ NEXT SECTOR
	-  =	READ PREVIOUS SECTOR
	I  =	STEP HEAD IN (TOWARD TRACK 76) AND READ
	O  =	STEP HEAD OUT (TOWARD TRACK 0) AND READ

	DUE TO A MINOR BUG WHICH I HAVEN'T HAD THE TIME TO
	FIX, THE FIRST COMMAND TO EXAM SHOULD BE A +.

MEMTST	- IS A MEMORY TEST FROM THE INTEL
	USERS LIBRARY. IT HAS INTERNAL I/O ROUTINES
	 AND MUST BE MODIFIED TO SUIT THE USERS SYSTEM.
	IT IS A VERY GOOD TEST OF MEMORY WHICH WE
	HAVE BEEN USING EXTENSIVELY IN THE LONG ISLAND CLUB.
	THE PROGRAM WILL DISPLAY MEMTST 1.0 AT WHICH
	POINT THE USER SHOULD ENTER STARTING AND
	ENDING HEX ADDRESSES SEPERATED BY A COMMA.
	THE PROGRAM WILL THEN TYPE ADDR: REF: ACT:
	AND BEGIN TESTING. ANY ERRORS WILL CAUSE
	AN ADDRESS ,REFERENCE DATA, AND ACTUAL DATA
	TO BE PRINTED.

ASSIGN	- IS THE DEVICE ASSIGNMENT UTILITY TO BE USED
	WITH THE VBIOS SUPPLIED. IT SHOULD BE ASSEMBLED TO
	OBTAIN THE DOCUMENTATION.

MAZE	- IS A MAZE PROGRAM FROM THE INTEL USERS LIBRARY.
	IT SHOULD RUN ON ANY SYSTEM.

TRAIN	- IS THE VDM TRAIN PROGRAM FROM THE PROCESSOR
	TECHNOLOGY NEWSLETTER. JUST TYPE
	TRAIN.

VBIOS31 AND BOOT31 ARE THE TWO PIECES OF A DEVICE-SELECTABLE
	CBIOS WITH A BUILT-IN VDM DRIVER.
	THESE TWO PIECES SHOULD BE INCORPORATED
	IN A SECOND LEVEL SYSGEN IF DESIRED. THE VDM
	DRIVER HAS SPEED CONTROL USING THE FRONT PANEL
	SWITCHES.

IDIR	-READS DIRECTORY OF ISIS (INTEL FDOS) DISKETTE
	IN DRIVE B

ICOPY	-READS FILE FROM ISIS DISKETTE IN DRIVE B, AFTER
	FINDING NAME FROM USING IDIR, AND COPIES AS CP/M FILE TO A
	COMMAND: "ICOPY FILNAME.TYP"

LIOS	-SET OF SUBROUTINES TO PERFORM CP/M LOGICAL FUNCTIONS FOR
	INCORPORATION IN NEW PROGRAMS
