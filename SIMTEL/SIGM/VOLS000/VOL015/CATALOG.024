	1. DUMP.ASM

	THIS IS A SLIGHTLY REVISED AND SOMEWHAT IMPROVED VERSION OF THE
DUMP PROGRAM I SENT BEFORE. IT IS REWRITTEN FOR THE NEW CP/M MACRO
ASSEMBLER. THIS ASSEMBLER IS QUITE A BIT BETTER THAN THE TDL ASSEMBLER,
BUT STILL SEEMS TO HAVE A FEW BUGS.
	THE NEW DUMP HAS THE MODIFICATIONS YOU (AND EVERYBODY ELSE)
SUGGESTED. IF YOU CAN DISPLAY THE SECTORS WHY CAN'T YOU CHANGE THEM?
NOW YOU CAN. I LIKED THE LITTLE DISK ALLOCATION MAP PROGRAM ALLOC
SO I INCLUDED A SIMILAR FEATURE IN DUMP. MY COMPLIMENTS TO THE AUTHOR.
I ALSO LIKED THE IDEAS OF THE OTHER DIRECTORY DISPLAY PROGRAMS
XDIR AND WDIR. THEY PUT ALL THE DIRECTORY ON THE SCREEN AT ONCE, BUT THEIR
FORMAT IS OTHERWISE LOUSY! I TRIED TO INCLUDE THIS FUNCTION IN DUMP BUT
THE ASSEMBLER BLEW UP ON ME. THE SOURCE GOT TOO LARGE AND I AM GETTING
SOME KIND OF TABLE OVERFLOW. CAN ANYBODY GIVE ME ANY HELP. DIGITAL RESEARCH
SAYS IT SHOULDN'T HAPPEN.
	ANYWAY I JUST PULLED THE LOGIC BACK OUT AND MADE IT A SEPARATE 
PROGRAM.

	2. XDIR.ASM

	XDIR GIVES A DIRECTORY DUMP. IT SORTS THE FILE NAMES ALPHABETICALLY
AND PRINTS THEM IN COLUMNS ALONG WITH THE SIZE OF THE FILES. FINALLY IT
GIVES YOU A COUNT OF THE NO OF FILES AND THE AMOUNT OF ROOM LEFT ON THE DISK

	3. MACRO.LIB

	THIS IS THE MACRO LIBRARY USED BY THE ABOVE 2 PROGRAMS AND IS OF
COURSE NECESSARY IF YOU WANT TO REASSEMBLE THE SOURCE. THE MACROS ARE QUITE
USEFUL BY THEMSELVES. THEY ARE BY NOW FAIRLY WELL OPTIMIZED FOR SIZE AND
SPEED. ALL THE LARGER ONES PRODUCE IN LINE SUBROUTINES WHICH SIMPLY GET
CALLED IF THE MACRO IS USED MORE THAN ONCE. THEY INCLUDE CONSOLE I/O,
DISK PRIMITIVES, A FEW GENERAL PURPOSE ROUTINES I ADAPTED FROM THE LIOS
LIBRARY AND SOME STRING HANDLING ROUTINES. I'M BEGINNING TO DEVELOPE SOME
DOUBLE PRECISION INDEXED ARITHMETIC ROUTINES. DLOAD AND DSTORE ARE IN THIS
MACRO LIBRARY. I'M STILL WORKING ON OTHERS.

	3. TAPELIB.MAC

	THIS IS A CASSETTE TAPE LIBRARY MANAGER FOR TARBELL FORMAT TAPES.
IT IS ESSENTIALLY PIP WRITTEN FOR CASSETTE TAPE. IT SUPPORTS NAMED FILES
AND ALLOWS BLOCK COPY OPERATIONS.  TAPE:=*.COM ETC.
	MANY PEOPLE ARE NOW USING IT TO BACK UP DISK FILES ON INEXPENSIVE
TAPE AND IT IS ESPECIALLY USEFUL IF YOU HAVE ONLY ONE DISK DRIVE.
TAPELIB WAS WRITTEN USING THE TDL ASSEMBLER AND THE MACROS ARE INCLUDED IN
THE SOURCE. THE FILE TAPELIB.DOC GIVES FAIRLY COMPLETE DESCRIPTION
AND OPERATING INSTRUCTIONS.
