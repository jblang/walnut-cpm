TITLE:  FELIX - GRAPHICS ANAMATION SYSTEM

FELIX is a "simple" computer graphics animation system.

It is based upon a pseudo-language for graphics, with an
assembler, subroutines, utilities, sample  programs, etc.  Ex:
BEE.FAS: a flower blooms, bee settles on it, flies off, a bird
eats the bee, then continues flying around.

Felix was written for use with the Cromemco TV Dazzler, and
D+7A with 2 joysticks.  "A few routines... rely on [these]...
you are invited to explore the source code". (so they say)

FELIX.DOC and a catalog file supply some information, but
the "real" documentation must be ordered for $10 from the
university of Tenn.  A second disk is also available for $10.

The code is well commented.  It consists of many .ASM files
which must be loaded - and use absolute memory JMPS.  Requires
a fairly large system - some ORGs go to 5800H.  Not just a .COM
file here folks - you have to like to diddle with DDT and HEX.

Abstracted by Ward Christensen.  I did not have access to
the necessary equipment to actually run the code.
