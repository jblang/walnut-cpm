VOLUME 23

STOIC (STACK ORIENTED INTERACTIVE COMPILER)

STOIC HAS THE CAPABILITIES OF A COMPILER, EDITOR, ASSEMBLER,
DEBUGGER, LOADER AND OPERATING SYSTEM.  IT APPEARS TO BE
CONCEPTUALLY SIMILAR TO FORTH IN THE USE OF AN EXTENSIBLE
VOCABULARY OF WORDS, WITH THE ABILITY TO "FORGET" DEFINITIONS
AND RE-DEFINE OR CREATE NEW WORDS IN TERMS OF PREVIOUSLY LEARNED
WORDS.

THE FIRST TWO MODULES, THE BOOTSTRAP AND KERNEL, WERE WRITTEN
IN ASSEMBLER MNEMONICS.  THEREAFTER THE MODULES WERE WRITTEN IN
STOIC WORDS.

THIS PACKAGE IS A STAND-ALONE SYSTEM AND DOES NOT REQUIRE A
RESIDENT FDOS, SUCH AS CP/M OR ISIS.

THE MATERIAL HAS BEEN SIGNIFICANTLY RE-ARRANGED AND REVISED SINCE
THE CATALOGS WERE PUBLISHED.  IN PARTICULAR THE KERNEL NOW INCORPORATES
WORD DEFINITIONS WHICH PERMIT DIRECT OPERATION THROUGH CP/M.
STOICCPM.DOC EXPLAINS THE PROCEDURE FOR BRINGING THE SYSTEM UP.  IT
WAS NECESSARY TO LEAVE CERTAIN FILES OFF BECAUSE OF LACK OF SPACE,
AND THESE CAN BE OBTAINED AS VOLUME 23B.  THE OVERFLOW VOLUMES WILL
ALSO BE ADDED TO A FUTURE REGULAR VOLUME, AND WERE SELECTED AS THE
LEAST NECESSARY FOR A CP/M USER.

FILES OF TYPE .STC ARE WRITTEN IN STOIC AND CAN BE LOADED AS DESCRIBED
IN THE VOLUME23.DOC

BECAUSE OF SPACE LIMITS, THE FILE STOIC.COM WAS NOT PLACED ON
THIS DISKETTE, AS SUGGESTED IN STOICCPM.DOC.  ALSO THE BOOTSTRAP
AND DOCUMENTATION ON THE BOOT AND SYSTEM LOADING WERE OMITTED.  THEY
CAN BE OBTAINED A VOLUME 23B, BUT IN ANY EVENT WILL APPEAR AS PART
OF A REGULARLY SCHEDULED FUTURE RELEASE.

TO CONSTRUCT THE STOIC.COM, IT IS NECESSARY TO ASSEMBLE THE KERNEL
AND THEN HAVE IT LOAD THE BASIC DEFINITIONS.  AS EXPLAINED BELOW, THE

NOTE THAT THE VALUE OF THE WORD "UNIT" IS DEFAULTED TO 0 IN
THE KERNEL.  THIS DEFINES THE DISK DRIVE FOR LOADING.  THE WORD
