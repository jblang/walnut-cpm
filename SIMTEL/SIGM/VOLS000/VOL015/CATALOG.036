TITLE:  ASSEMBLERS, EDITORS, AND TEXT PROCESSORS

COMBINE.ASM and COMBINE.COM are source and object of a utility
to concatenate assembler source files and remove comments.
This becomes necessary when trying to assemble very large
source files which have been broken down into modules for
ease of editing.  Could also be used to strip comments from
a single file.  Requires MAC for assembly.  Command line
format is:
	COMBINE dest.asm=source1,source2,...,sourceN
Originaly written by Ward Christensen, revised by Steve Ness
and Robert A. Van Valzah.

PEN-CPM.ASM is the source code for a transient which will
convert files in Electric Pencil format to normal CP/M ASCII
file format.  CPM-PEN.ASM is the inverse operation.  Author
written documentation is provided in PEN-CPM.DOC.  The source
code is well written and commented.  Both files require MAC
and SEQIO.LIB for assembly.  These utilities would be useful
to anyone owning the Electric Pencil or anyone wishing to
exchange files with an Electric Pencil user.  Reviewed by
Robert A. Van Valzah.

LINKASM.COM is an assembler which is upward compatible with
ASM.COM supplied by Digital Research with CP/M.  It has the
additional feature that it can produce one object file from the
sequential assembly of several 'linked' source files.  This is
most useful when maintaining very large application programs
written in assembler.  It is much easier to edit several 10K
source files than a 100K one!  LINKASM is a bit faster that
the CP/M assembler too.  It also has provision to write a
symbol file compatible with SID.  Several utilities are
provided to facilitate the maintaince of linked source files.
They are: LINES, LIST, and FIND.  See appropriate docs for
details.  Source for LINKASM cannot be provided at this time.

MAC6.AZM contains source for patches to the paper tape TDL
Z-80 assembler to make it work from CP/M disk files.  This
is a revision of MAC4.ASM from volume 18.  It is written
in TDL mnemonics so MAC6.COM is included so that you can
get around the chicken-egg problem.  MAC6.DOC contains the
installation instructions.  TOP.AZM is a similar patch to
CP/Mifiy a paper tape version TDL Text Output Processor.
TOP.TOP is a sample input file to the processor and TOP.PRN
is the resulting output.  Reviewed by Robert A. Van Valzah.

ML80 is structured assembler programming language for the
8080.  It allows you to increment the accumulator by writing
A=A+1.  Control constructs are provide for conditional
branching and iteration.  A powerful macro pre-processor is
provided to allow the equivalent of EQU's and other neat stuff.
The original code appeared in volume 4 but was flawed by some
nasty bugs.  The files M81.COM and L82.COM are patched versions
of those from volume 4.  ML80.REF is a quick reference for
ML80 syntax, semantics, and errors.  ML80.DOC describes the
changes made to the original .COM files.  Reviewed by
Robert A. Van Valzah.

MFACCESS.LIB is an assembler subroutine.  It provides routines
to read multiple files with wildcard names.  For instance, it
would enable you to write a transient which would print all
.ASM files on a disk simply by typing PRINT *.ASM.  One
restriction is that files can only be read, they cannot be
renamed or erased using MFACCESS.LIB.  This file would be most
useful to those who know how to write transients and wish to
allow them to work with wildcard filenames.  Reviewed by
Robert A. Van Valzah.

POW.ASM is the source for a text processor (Processor Of Words)
transient.  The original source appeared in Dr. Dobbs Journal,
number 29.  It has been CP/Mified and had one minor bug fixed.
It has ability to define margins, justify, center, space,
paragraph and title a document.  Requires an editor for
preperation of the input text (ED will do) and a printer on
your LST device for operation.  The source is fairly well
written and doucmented, making it fairly easy to modify.
Some documentation is provided in POW.DOC and pieces of the
DDJ article appear in POWCMDS.POW and POWTEXT.POW.  Reviewed
by Robert A. Van Valzah.

SCRAMBLE.ASM is a utility to encode and decode the contents
of a CP/M file.  The primary use for it is to maintain data
security.  This is necessary if you want to leave protected
information on a public access system (such as yours might
be when running a remote console program).  The author makes
no guarantees of the throughness of this program, but he does
not think that he could unscramble a file without knowing
the password, even if given the first 256 byte of the plain
text.  Files are scrambled 'in place' (as opposed to reading
a plain text file and writing a cypher text file) and as a
consequence there is a chance that a disk error may destroy
the file.  Reviewed by Robert A. Van Valzah.

TED.COM is a text editor transient.  TED.DOC contains
documentaion.  This is a line oriented editor which should
make a good alternative to ED.COM for those who prefer a line
oriented editor over a character oriented editor.  Commands
are proviede to search for a string, substitute strings, type
line, move and copy lines from place to place, delete lines,
and give help on commands.  This self help mode could be very
useful to beginners or to those who have not used an editor
before.  TED seems to have farily good error detection and
recovery facilities.  The source code has not been provided.
TED was written at the Naval Post-graduate School (which has
brought us BASIC-E and ML80).  TED requires at least a 24K
CP/M system size in order to run.  
Reviewed by Robert A. Van Valzah. 

XREF.ASM is source for cross reference generator utility which
accepts as input standard INTEL format assembler source code.
Modified version of NYCPMUG 8.27.  Now accepts lower case,
ignores PAGE and ELSE psuedo-ops, has improved error messages,
and has equates to changes things like lines per page and so
on.  Modified by Steve Ness of the Mark Williams Company.
