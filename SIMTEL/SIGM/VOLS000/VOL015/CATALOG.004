ACT

ACT(OR) IS A TRAK-LIKE STRING PROCESSING LANGUAGE.
ACT31 IS THE MOST RECENT REVISION OF THE INTERPRETER.  THE
SYNTAX IS DESCRIBED IN ACT.DOC.

ACTUC IS A VERSION OF THE INTERPRETER USING UPPER-CASE
CHARACTER SET ONLY.

Z-LCTOUC IS A PROGRAM WHICH WILL CONVERT A STANDARD ACT
SOURCE INTO THE ACTUC CONVENTION.  THE FILE ITSELF
INCLUDES INSTRUCTIONS. (THE Z- WAS ADDED TO THE NAME ONLY TO
ADD IT TO THE CATALOG AT THE LAST MINUTE. RENAME TO SOMETHING
MORE CONVENIENT)

AMAZE, AMUSE, HAIKU AND FDL ARE ACTOR PROGRAMS.

ENJOY.........


ML80

ML80 IS AN ASSEMBLY LANGUAGE INCORPORATING SOME HIGH-LEVEL
CONTROL CONSTRUCTS.  INCLUDED IN THE PACKAGE IS A RECURSIVE
MACRO PROCESSOR, RELOCATING COMPILER AND LINKING LOADER.
A LANGUAGE MANUAL IS AVAILABLE FROM DIGITAL RESEARCH,
DIGITAL SYSTEMS AND NTIS FOR THE COPYING COST.

THE MODULES SUPPLIED HERE WORK!!!!!  THIS IS UNLIKE MOST NOW
FLOATING AROUND.  TRY IT OUT ON XDIR AND WDIR, WRITTEN BY
BRUCE RATOFF.  SEE ML.SUB FOR SEQUENCE.


FORTRAN

MAZE AND CALENDAR COM'S ARE WORKING CP/M OBJECTS WHICH CREATE
A MAZE TO THE CONSOLE OR A CALENDAR DISK FILE RESPECTIVELY.

THE SOURCES ARE INCLUDED, TOGETHER WITH SUB-PROGRAMS IN FORTRAN
AND ASSEMBLY LANGUAGE, IN ORDER TO ILLUSTRATE THE CAPABILITIES
OF MICROSOFT FORTRAN-80.

               MAZE.FOR+RND.FOR=MAZE.COM
        CALENDAR.FOR+NUMBER.MAC=CALENDAR.COM
