VOLUME 39

MUSIC PROGRAMS:

(1) plays 3 part harmony thru the 8080 interrupt enable line!
	(Some .MUS might be incomplete - but lotsa fun here)
(2) plays 4(?) part harmony thru 8 bit DAC, uses BASIC to
    "compile" the parts.
(3) Patches for Software Technology Music, for SOL+CP/M

---->	Look out, both (1) and (2) use filetype .MUS, so watch
	the (1) and (2) to see which a particular .MUS is for.

TITLE:  MUSIC PLAYING PROGRAMS

MUSIC.COM contains a three voice music program with the
ability to load and save programs in CP/M files (but don't
PIP them without the [O] option).  This program takes music
entered in a screwball hexadecimal (it figures) notation and
compiles (scores) it into a series of instructions which
wiggle the interrupt enable line fast enough to produce three
voices.  The source code is kept in memory in a line numbered
format (a la BASIC) and edited with a built in editor.
Musically, it has a range of about 2 1/2 octaves and supports
stacatto, long and short articulation, dotted notes, and
whole thru sixty-fourth notes.  Source code is not available,
but good doucmentation is contained in MUSIC.DOC.  Requires
some simple hardware (from Radio Shack), an amplifier and a
speaker.  All .MUS files not listed under MUSIC4 (below)
work with this MUSIC.COM.  Reviewed by Robert A. Van Valzah.

MUSIC4.ASM is a program to play music.  It seems to have the
ability to produce four different voices.  Several sample songs
have been included.  It requires a Z-80 CPU (though it can
be assembled with ASM.COM) and an 8-bit digital-to-analog
converter.  BASIC-E is needed to run some of the support
software for generating song files.  See MUSIC4.DOC for the
documentaion provided by the author.  The code is not very
well commented and is tricky in nature (very time critical),
making it hard to modify.  Files included are:  MUSIC4.ASM,
MUSIC4.COM, 2PRTFJSB.MUS, 2PRTFJSB.NOT, AWAVE.BAS, AWAVE.INT,
FIX.SUB, LVBMIN.MUS, LVBMIN.NOT, NOTES.BAS, NOTES.INT,
PUR2MIN.MUS, PUR2MIN.NOT, WAVES.MUS, REMOV".ASM, and REMOV".COM
(the last two files may be useful to BASIC-E users in general,
as they remove double quotes from data files).  Reviewed by
Robert A. Van Valzah.

MUSPAT.HEX is an overlay for a three voice music program
written by Software Technology.  As supplied by Software
Technology, this program requires a Processor Technology
SOL computer for loading and saving of the music files.
This patch lets SOL owners who run CP/M save music files
on disk.  It requires the sound output board from Software
Technology and SOL computer.  The source cannot be supplied
as it contains some routines that its author is marketing
in another product.  Documentation written by the author
is supplied in MUSPAT.DOC.  Reviewed by Robert A. Van Valzah.
