TITLE:  BASIC:  MATH PROBLEMS, CRAPS, JOURNAL, PARTS LIST

Abstract:	Math Problem Generator System
Abstract Author:	Tom Digate - Dec., 1979
Files utilized include: CHAIN, FRAC1, FRAC2, FRAC3, FRAC4,
DEC1, DEC2, DEC3, DEC4, DEC5, DEC6, DECIMAL, WHOLE, FORMULA,
AREA, INTEGER, VOLUME, DISTANCE, FRACTION, WEIGHT, PERCENT.
(.BAS and .INT Files), COMPILE, HEADER, GRADE, COMMON1.TXT
Program uses: Can be used to tutor students in mathematics
problems. Also has metric problems. Generates a grade report
file.
Restrictions: Requires CBASIC2 to compile and run. Largest mod-
ule is less than 4K. Largest source module is 5K.
Comments: Program runs well and is self prompting. Few comments
in source file. Menu made for 24 line screen. No .DOC file but
just run CHAIN.INT to startup. Program structure is sound.
In general, a useful program for school-kids.

CRAPS.BAS is very elaborate craps playing program written in
CBASIC-II.  It requires a lot of memory to compile -- all I
know is that it won't compile or run in a 40K system.  The
program seems to be well written and commented, but I was
unable to see it run because of memory size limitations.

JRNL.ABS COMMENTARY FOR JRNL.BAS JOURNAL PROGRAM
    JRNL.BAS IS DESIGNED TO BE USED AS A LEDGER-TYPE PROGRAM TO
KEEP TRACK OF EXPENSES AND INCOME.  IT IS PRESENTLY SET UP FOR
BUSINESS USAGE (RUN PROGRAM WITH COMMAND "B" FOR CATEGORIES),
BUT COULD BE MODIFIED FOR INDIVIDUAL NEEDS SIMPLY BY CHANGING
THE COLUMN HEADINGS.
    THE OUTPUT OF THE COMMAND-LIST IS DESIGNED FOR AN 80 COLUMN
BY 24 LINE CRT, BUT SCROLLING CONTROL WILL GET YOU THERE WITH
64X16.  YOU DO NEED BASIC-E AND A GOOD DEAL OF MEMORY (IT WILL
NOT RUN IN A 40K SYSTEM).  
    THE PROGRAM SEEMS TO BE FAIRLY WELL-WRITTEN WITH GOOD
NOTATION/COMMENTING.  IT DOES USE FILE-SPACE ON DISK TO KEEP
A LIST OF THE EXPENSES, ETC.

PARTS.BAS and MANPARTS.BAS contain programs for printing a
parts list for an S100 board (or anything else that needs a
parts list).  CPUPARTS.BAS contains a sample database for
printing a parts list for a CPU board.  These programs
appear to be written for Microsoft basic.  They were not
submitted with any documentation.  Reviewed by
Robert A. Van Valzah.

PASSWORD.BAS is a basic program to change keywords in your
basic interpreter.  For example you could change the keyword
'LIST' to 'SHOW' so as to prevent unauthorized use of these
keywords.  This program was published in Interface Age
magazine, Feb '80, p20.  It is unclear which basics can
execute this program, but I'll bet it doesn't work with
current releases of Microsoft basic.  Reviewed by
