Documentation for LEH Diskette
 
ADE - Absolute Disk Editor
 
   Allows user to view contents of absolute sectors or tracks, either
   in absolute sector order, or CP/M 6:1 interlace order. Very useful
   when debugging disk i/o programs. Also useful for exploring an
   unknown diskette. For details on ADE commands, see source file.
 
COPY - Absolute Disk Copy Utility
 
   Yet another disk to disk copy program. This one runs in about 1.5 min.
   It uses a 5:1 interlace. It also entertains the user while running.
 
SCOPY - Absolute Disk Copy Utility for single drive systems
 
   Version of COPY which runs on a single drive CP/M system. On a
   32K system, 9 passes are required, for a total of 18 diskette
   swaps. Not terribly cool, but if all you got is one drive.....
 
LINK - Communications Link Executive (for D C Hayes Modem Board)
 
   Allows user to link into remote processor via D C Hayes 80-103A
   modem board. Much more elaborate versions of this little jewel
   are in the works. All god's chillun ought to have a modem board.
   This program allows transfer of text files to and from disk. It
   appears to the remote system as a rather bright teletype. To use:
 
        LINK xxx-xxxx      Dial and await answer, then link
        LINK               Jump to link immediately if carrier present

   For further details on operation of LINK, see source file.
 
LINK73 - Communications Link Executive (for outboard modem)
 
   Older version of LINK for you folks without Hayes modem boards,
   who do have outboard modems (or direct lines) to remote computers.
 
 
RM80 - Resident Monitor for an 8080 or Z80 System
 
   3K PROM monitor for a tape system. Currently set up for a Tarbell
   tape interface with motor control relays. Allows user to dump or
   enter memory in HEX or ASCII, read or write standard tarbell tapes,
   read, write, or scan its very own physical record format tapes (as
   used by TREAD and TSAVE). It also has a communications link facility
   with on-line loaders for object files or text files. Currently set
   up for outboard modem - version for D C Hayes board is planned.
   Lots of other goodies are detailed in the file RM80.DOC. This is a
   good way to help bring up your less fortunate friends who haven't
   yet figured out that disk is the only way to live. Also useful if
   you are responsible for other 8080 systems which don't have disks.
 
SAP - Sort And Pack CP/M Directory
 
   Sorts CP/M directory, discards zero length files, and performs a
   pack on seperated chunks of a multi-extent file (see XFER).
 
TREAD - Read RM80 Physical record format tapes to disk
 
   Useful for backing up disk files on (cheaper) cassettes. Also very
   useful for transferring files to a standalone tape system which is
   running RM80.
 
TSAVE - Write CP/M disk files onto RM80 physical record format tapes
 
   Complementary program to TREAD. My first CP/M code - don't laugh.
 
XFER - Diskette to Diskette File Transfer Utility
 
   Allows user to transfer any size file from one diskette to another
   with a minimum of hassle. A copy of this should be kept on every
   diskette (if you have a single drive system), as it comes in quite
   useful is case of diskette crash. This little gem makes a single 
   drive CP/M system livable. Multi-extent files may be transferred 
   one extent at a time and rejoined at the other end via SAP.
 
                *** I M P O R T A N T ***
 
   Please note that many of these programs require a more intimate
   interaction with the hardware than CP/M provides, hence must be
   edited and re-assembled for different memory and i/o configurations
   All versions supplied are for a 32K system with a PTC 3P+S at 0.
   When possible, CP/M standard I/O (via BDOS) was used. All other
   I/O is described fairly well in the internal documentation. 
 
   I welcome helpful comments on any of the above code, but make no
   claims as to its perfection or applicability. (That means I will
   NOT fix or change things for free). All of the above code is 
   hereby released into the public domain, for use in personal 8080
   or Z80 computer systems. If you wish to obtain rights to use any
   of it for commercial purposes, please contact me. If you make
   lots of money from it without sending me a cut, your ears just
   might rot off (old family curse). Fairly elaborate extensions
   to CP/M are in the works, and will be announced via this club,
   and/or Dr. Dobbs. For further information, please contact me at

A.R.G. - Note that Larry's sytem has his BIOS jump table 300H
below the nominal MEMSIZE, not normal 200H.  These references
should be changed before assembly if you decide to run with
the fixed memory size versions offered here.  Also notice in
ADE some fancy (and non-standard) footwork with the IOBYTE
in order to get a listing and console output from the same
subroutine.  Suggest a revision here.
