

   THIS DISK CONTAINS FILE CONVERSION PROGRAMS FOR USE UNDER CP/M. 


    THE FIRST SUBMITTAL IS "FDOS.ASM" WHICH ALLOWS THE USER TO ACCESS
PERTEC / ICOM FDOS III OPERATING SYSTEM DISKETTE FILES ON A SINGLE 
DENSITY DISKETTE IN DRIVE B:. THIS PROGRAM WILL RUN ON ANY CP/M COMPUTER
WITH A SINGLE DENSITY 8" DRIVE B:. THE FDOS DIRECTORY MAY BE READ, FILES
MAY BE TRANSFERRED DIRECTLY TO A CP/M FILE, AND A CP/M FILE MAY BE WRITTEN
ON TO THE FDOS III DISKETTE.

    THE SECOND SUBMITTAL "MTX.ASM" IS A PROGRAM TO ACCESS PERTEC MTX BASIC 
FILES ON A DOUBLE DENSITY DISK IN DRIVE B:. THE NATURE OF THE DISKETTE FORMAT
REQUIRES THE PROGRAM TO RUN UNDER LIFEBOAT CP/M 1.4 ON A PERTEC FD3812
DISK SYSTEM. THE MTX DIRECTORY MAY BE DISPLAYED AT THE CONSOLE, MTX FILES
MAY BE COPIED DIRECTLY TO LIFEBOAT 3812 FORMAT CP/M FILES, AND A CP/M FILE
MAY BE PLACED UPON THE MTX DISKETTE.

    THE THIRD PROGRAM "MTX2000.ASM" IS A PROGRAM TO ACCESS PERTEC MTX BASIC 
FILES ON A DOUBLE DENSITY DISK IN DRIVE B:. THE NATURE OF THE DISKETTE FORMAT
REQUIRES THE PROGRAM TO RUN UNDER PERTEC CP/M 1.4 ON A PERTEC PCC 2000 COMPUTER
WITH DOUBLE DENSITY FLOPPY CAPABILITY. THE MTX DIRECTORY MAY BE DISPLAYED AT 
THE CONSOLE, MTX FILES MAY BE COPIED DIRECTLY TO PERTEC PCC 2000 FORMAT CP/M 
FILES, AND A CP/M FILE MAY BE PLACED UPON THE MTX DISKETTE.

    THE LAST PROGRAM IS A NEAT LITTLE ULILITY THAT ALLOWS A PERTEC PCC 2000
FORMAT CP/M 1.4 DOUBLE DENSITY DISKETTE TO BE ACCESSED IN DRIVE B: OF AN
ICOM 3812 RUNNING UNDER LIFEBOAT CP/M 1.4. THIS PROGRAM REQUIRES THAT THE
CP/M SYSTEM SIZE BE 24K BYTES TO ALLOW ROOM FOR A TRANSIENT BIOS PATCH
TO MOVED INTO MEMORY ABOVE THE NORMAL BIOS LOCATION. OPERATION OF THE PROGRAM
IS TO SIMPLY RUN "PCC2000B.COM". FROM THEN TILL THE NEXT COLD BOOT TIME THE
DRIVE B: DISK DRIVERS WILL ASSUME PCC 2000 FORMAT CP/M DISK CHARACTERISTICS.
THE FUNCTION OF THE UTILITY IS VERY SIMILAR TO THE LIFEBOAT 3812 CP/M PROGRAM
CALLED SINGLEB.
