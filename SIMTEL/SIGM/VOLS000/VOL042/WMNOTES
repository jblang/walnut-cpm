This program is public domain because: 
1. They contain no material proprietry to MicroPro
2. They are of no use to people who are not licencees
     of WordMaster
3. They were produced by the author. All symbols in the files
     are original.
   All documentation was written by author


To whom would this program be useful: 
People using WordMaster
People using CDOS who would like a good editor capable
   of using the 'motors off' feature of CDOS


Briefly describe the program function: 
The .SYM, .CTL, .DOC files can be read using Ward Christensen's 
RESOURCE.COM together with the licensee's copy of WordMaster.
These  files enable a partial disassembly of WordMaster only by 
licensees of that product.
The WM.ASM file describes how the users copy of WordMaster  can 
then be customized.
In particular the following are facilitated:
1. Customization of cursor control characters
2. Customization of video mode control characters
3. Control of CDOS motors off feature by WordMaster.



Where is further documentation available: 
WM.ASM


Hardware dependencies: 
Nil, but CROMEMCO users can use the 'motors off' feature.


Software dependencies: 
Needs WM.COM   (WordMaster)
      RESOURCE.COM   (From previous users group disk)


Source processor: 
not applicable


Does the software "drop in": 
Yes


How easy is the code to modify: 
Relatively easy,  but note that the WM.CTL file is not reliable 
in sections of WordMaster other than those discussed in WM.ASM
