NOTE from CALAMITY CLIFFS COMPUTER CENTER  -  9/1/80

The FORTH11.ASM file as it stands is apparently set up to run on a
HEATH system.  We have no information on the function of any of the
labels in the source listing, and as there is no (or very little)
useful commenting in the source listing regarding what code is hard-
ware dependent and how it should be modified for use on other systems,
we offer this program with the advice:

    ******  CAUTION  >>>>  CAVEAT EMPTOR  <<<<  CAUTION  ******

Before attempting to use or modify the program, it is advised that the
complete documentation be procured from the FORTH INTEREST GROUP.  In
addition it might be a good idea to contact Rick Schaeffer for clari-
fication concerning the uncertain function of much of the code in the
program.  The only thing that we can attest to at the present time is
that we have successfully assembled the code, as you see it here, with
the CP/M 2.2 Digital Research assembler without error.  We have not
tried to run the program, as the hardware dependencies have not been
identified with certainty.  In addition, we have no idea whether or not
it will run successfully under CP/M 2.2.

THIS DOCUMENTATION SUPPLEMENTS THE ASSEMBLER SOURCE FOR FIG-FORTH WHICH
RESIDES HERE AS FORTH11.ASM.  THIS SOURCE IS PROVIDED THROUGH THE COURTESY

THIS COPY OF FIG-FORTH HAS BEEN DE-BUGGED IN THAT IT IS RUNNING ON MY
H8 SYSTEM UNDER CP/M VERSION 1.43.  AFTER SEVERAL ABORTIVE ATTEMPTS,
I SUCCEEDED IN DOWN LOADING IT TO MICRONET BUT I HAVE NO WAY OF KNOWING
IF THERE WERE ANY ERRORS IN TRANSMISSION SINCE I DO NOT HAVE ANY WAY
OF HAND SHAKING WITH MNET.  ON THE VERSION THAT I HAVE RUNNING, I HAVE
CHANGED SOME OF THE ADDRESSES TO MAKE ROOM FOR MORE DISK BUFFERS, HOWEVER,
THIS COPY IS INTACT AS PRINTED IN THE FIG-FORTH ASSEMBLY LISTING.  THIS
SHOULD MAKE IT RELATIVELY EASY FOR INTERESTED USERS TO GET THE SYSTEM RUNNING
EVEN IF SOME OF THE DATA WAS LOST IN TRANSMISSION BECAUSE THE ASSEMBLED
ADDRESSES SHOULD BE THE SAME AS THEY APPEAR IN THE FIG LISTINGS (THIS IS
FOR FIG-FORTH VERSION 1.1....BY THE WAY).  YOU SHOULD HAVE THE FIG
MODEL MANUAL AND THE FIG ASSEMBLY SOURCE LISTING BEFORE ATTEMPTING TO USE
THIS.   HOPEFULLY, AT LEAST THIS SAVES A *LOT* OF TYPING FOR SOMEONE!
GOOD LUCK!
