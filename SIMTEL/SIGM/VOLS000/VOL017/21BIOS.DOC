To Whom it may concern:

	This disk contains a recently developed BIOS and support routines
for CP/M (Copyright Digital Research).  The BIOS was developed from rou-
tines retrieved from the CPMUG, Tarbell Electronics, DR's CP/M 2.0 and
J. S. Singer.  It is meant to operate as a full blown BIOS under CP/M 2.0.
In particular, it was developed to give the full disk capabilities that
CP/M 2.0 and DFOCO, a disk utility by S. J. Singer, provide.  It supports
single and double density disks with 128, 256, 512 or 1024 sector sizes.
The non-disk drivers fully support the virtual re-assignments allowed via
the IOBYTE.  Also, special utilities are provided to give the user quick
access to the new functions being supported.

	The BIOS may be as large as 2.75k.  Currently, it is limited to
.75k by the way its stored on the diskette.  To provide more room, I put
the CCP on the disk as a regular disk file.  For warm or cold starts, I
merely open it as a regular file and read it in.  Unfortunately, this 
takes more time than I really like due to required system overhead (I.E.
System Reset, Disk Select, etc.).  In the future, I plan to change it so
that 3 tracks are used for system tracks instead of two.

	To generate the system, follow the instructions given in the BIOS.
You will use files, 21BIOS.ASM and 21BOOT.ASM.  The system generation is
almost the same as if you were doing it for any old CP/M.  To regenerate
the system under itself, you MUST use the NPGEN.ASM file instead of SYSGEN
and 21BOOT.ASM.  These instructions can be found in the front of NPGEN.ASM.
Please insure that you are familiar with system generations before tackling
this one.  Also, always keep a backup of your old system.  This thing can
become tricky!

	I look forward to any constructive comments and suggestions.

1.  It may seem that some the files on this tape are repeats of old ones.
    Be advised that ALL files have been updated.  That is, they are dif-
    ferent from the old ones.  Please don't try to interchange them.

2.  System generations may be hazardous to the health of your current sys-
    tem if you don't back it up.  Always do so!  Also, generate the new
    system 16k smaller than your current one.  Then to check out problems
    with DDT, you can re-boot your current system and look at the new BIOS's
    areas.

3.  All programs on this disk require MAC, the macro assembler distributed
    by Digital Research.
