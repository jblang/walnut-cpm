    MOVECOM.WPM is a SPELLBINDER 5.1+ MACRO PROGRAMME
  
    It may be used to strip comments (starting with a semi-
colon. Alternatively, use it to re-align the comments to
a given position.
    Any attempt to use the programme with Spellbinder versions
lower than 5.1 will be fruitless, since the macro programme
make use of quite a few new Spellbinder functions.
    To alter the macro to strip or align comments in source
files which use other then the semi-colon delimiters, change
the line reading :sp 59.... and replace the 59 with the ASCII
value of the new delimiter.
 
    Not the world's hottest programming aid, but it make source
files appearances somewhat neater. c.a.
