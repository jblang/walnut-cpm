Documentation file for TALK program, Version 1.5.

TALK is a program which makes use of Z80 support
chips to microcommunicate with another computer
system or terminal via a serial data channel.

The TALK.COM file included has been assembled to
run on a Ferguson BIG BOARD via its Z80 SIO at ports
05/07 using 300 baud 8 bits/character. The interrupt
buffers are set to 4096 bytes and the delay option
included. It should run unmodified on the Bigboard.

Hopefully it will also serve as a good basis for
use on those computer cards that make extensive
use of on board Z80 support chips.

The main problem for some to use this program
may be the unfamiliar TDL/XITAN/PSA Assembler
used for the source file. In converting to
another assembler, the mneumonics for any
special Z80 instructions should be easy. The
Z80 library supplied with MAC is very close
to these. The other strange items seen are:
	= or == can be replaced by EQU
	.TITLE,.SBBTL,.IDENT etc can
			dropped.
	.IF1 or .IF2  condition test for
			first or second pass.
	.IFx arg,[true text]..{[false text]}
			is the format of a
		conditional. x can be such
		things as B(blank),E(zero or
		blank),N (not zero).

	.printx prints out at assembly time.
	.byte,.word,.blkb can be changed to
		db,dw and ds respectively.
	"." means "here" as "$" is used in ASM.
	.loc is the same as ORG.
