          *** BEWARE OF ZORTON ***
	This is an expanded version of Adventure. This one has a cave
that is twice as large (it's a 550 point version). All of the features
of the original adventure are in this version, plus a whole bunch of
new rooms, treasures, and ways for the bumbling explorer to get oneself
killed. 

	Mike Goetz (NYACC) who adapted the original version of Adventure
for CP/M (SIG/M volumes 1, 2, and 3) has released this expanded version
to the SIG/M group for non-commercial distribution.
