ABSTRACT OF VOLUME 45

Osborne/McGraw-Hill Payroll with Cost Accounting

It is assumed that the user of this disk will also
have obtained CP/M User Group volumes 43 and 44,
Osborne's Accounts-Payable/Accounts-Receivable and
General Ledger programs.  This is important in this
case as we ran out of room on the disk (Oh, for a
standard for double density!)  and some of the subroutine
'.BAS' files are on the other disks.  I refer specifically
to the following:
	CURSOR.BAS
	SUBS1.BAS
	GENINFO.BAS
	
In addition it seems that our source (he who typed-in all
these programs) missed some of the P/R subroutines which
may be found in the book PAYROLL WITH COST ACCOUNTING
published by Osborne/McGraw-Hill:
	PRNMASK.BAS
	FIND-EOF.BAS
	MSTRIN.BAS
	MSTROUT.BAS
	HISTORY.BAS
	P-RSEARC.BAS
	JOBFILE.BAS

Also, one of the "main" programs is missing from this disk:
	MSTRINIT.BAS

The above files are not overly lengthy and may be keyed in
without too much difficulty.  It is assumed that the user will
compile these programs and place the .INT files on a master
workdisk, leaving the .BAS files elsewhere as they are not
needed for actual operation.

There is a file P/R.SUB on this disk for ease of compiling.
It is assumed that the person installing these programs for
usage will have some familiarity with CBASIC2 conventions.

The CP/M Users' Group assumes no liability or responsibility
for these programs or the results of using these programs.
