DESCRIPTION:	The BDS C Sampler Disk
		November 29, 1980

	Compiled by Leor Zolman, BD Software

-  Manual for BDS-C to give you a "flavor" of the compiler
-  Good programming examples in C
-  Interesting games to play
-  Good use of H19-H89 (Programs with <H> are H19-H89 only)

Most files are included in .COM form to allow you to execute
them without having BDS-C.  Be careful of RALLY.COM as it needs
to do hard-coded I/O to detect console OUT status.

	The BDS C Sampler Disk		For the CPMUG	   November 29, 1980
	----------------------		------------------------------------
					Compiled by Leor Zolman, BD Software


This disk contains a collection of programs written in BDS C, both in source
and compiled forms, along with a short document describing the BDS C package
for those who've never seen it. Some of the programs have been distributed
with the BDS C package in the past, but currently there are so many assembler
sources provided with the package that there isn't much room for games; thus,
if you have purchased v1.4 or a later version of the compiler, many of these
programs will be new to you. 

Since H19 terminals and H89 computers are pretty popular among the company I
keep, there are a lot of game programs here that require the H19 hardware. If
you don't have either an H19 or access to one, non-H19 versions of some of
the games are also provided for use on any kind of terminal.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Here are descriptions of the programs on this disk:

TABIFY.C:	utility to turn sequences of spaces into tabs where possible

PRESSUP.C:	"Pressups" board game, uses alpha-beta searching

STONE.C:	"Awari" board game (pits and stones); [HSTONE.C for H19/H89]

LIFE.C:		What can one say about this? [HLIFE.C for H19/H89]

MM.C:		Single-player mastermind, you guess and computer kibitzes.

TTT.C:		Invincible tic-tac-toe game.

OTHELLO.C:	The game of dramatic reversals.

RALLY.C:	Arcade game, for H19/H89 only. NOTE: this program uses the
		console serial port parameters defined in BDSCIO.H, and so
		will probably NOT run on your system until those parameters
		are customized and the program recompiled (this is necessary
		because the program must be able to poll the console OUTPUT,
		to see if it is ready to send, and there is no way to do this
		using CP/M bdos or bios calls...thus the bit numbers must be
		built right into the program...)

BUGS.C:		Make bizzare thingies crawl around on your H19/H89 screen.

PPONG.C:	Polish Pong for H19/H89 only.

National CP/M Users Group disk 48 abstracts.

Leor Zolman's BDS-C is rapidly becoming one of the most popular
non-BASIC high-level languages under CP/M, for both the
hobbyist and the professional.  A nice structured language at
a reasonable cost, with good documentation, and good execution
speed.  ...AND totally integrated into CP/M.

"C" itself it a highly structured language, implementing the
"classic" requirements for structured programming: It can
either directly or indirectly perform DO WHILE, REPEAT UNTIL,
DO CASE, as well as a rich "FOR"-type capability.

With a few exceptions, BDS-C implements "C" as covered in the
Kernighan and Ritchie "The C Programming Language" book, which
comes with BDS-C.  I quote the Lifeboat Ad:

	Supports structures, unions, 2 dimensional
	arrays, pointers, recursion and overlays.
	Features optimized code generator, variable	
	sized buffers for file I/O, and capability
	to produce ROMable code.  Includes macro
	package to enable user to produce linkable
	modules with MAC.  Floating point functions,
	full run-time package and machine code
	library sources provided.  Linker, library
	manager, and textbook provided.  Compiler
	lacks initializers, statics, floats, and longs.

For the convenience of "experienced" C programmers, BDS-C
allows, for example, "register specification" for a variable,
which, while not implemented, is syntactically accepted.  The
most obvious thing missing is a data type of "float", but a
floating point subroutine package is included, and a modified
"printf" to support it.
		----------------
Due to the more recent versions having very complete source
code for run-time packages and the system libraries, many
excellent programs have been "squeezed" off of the single
density distribution disk.

This volume, in part, represents a source for these very good
source programs, while offering several interesting .COM files
for those who do not have the BDS-C compiler. 

The Users Group solicits additional BDS-C programs, and hopes
to regularly come out with disks containing BDS-C programs.

The programs on the disk are primarily intelligent game pro-
grams, with some H19/H89 programs which take advantage of this
CRT's capabilities, such as graphics.  A good utility, TABIFY,
is also included.  See Leor's own "VOLUME48.DOC" on the disk,
for comments.
		----------------
Here's some additional comments about the programs on the disk:

LIFE.COM: Nice implementation.  Enjoyable code to read,
as are most of the programs.  An interesting touch when
you decide the configuration is no longer interesting - 
press your "del" key, and if you don't smile, you're made
of stone.

MM.COM: So you want to play a simple game of letter guessing,
eh?  Try this one.  But watch your ego: it can be deflated.
MasterMind is a "simple" game, that makes you think.  The
computer generates a random "word" consisting of 4 letters
from A-F.  You simply "guess" 4 letters at a time, and MM tells
you how many are "hits" i.e. the right letter in the right
spot, and how many are misses.  Thus you deduce the missing
pattern.  The game goes a bit slow, however (at least at 2MHz).
Why?  MM is computing how many possible words exist based
on the clues it has given you.  When this number reaches "1",
it says: 
	"You should have it by now".
It becomes a real challenge to see how few times you can keep
that message from coming out, and is a "real thrill" to "beat
it" - especially a couple times in a row.  However, having it
"know" YOU should "know", but you "missed" catching on for, say
5 turns, makes you feel like a real dummy.  I finally made a MM
"worksheet" to try to be more efficient.  It looks like:

		AB | AB | AB | AB
		CD | CD | CD | CD
		EF | EF | EF | EF

Thus I guess:	A    B	  C    D
and hear:				0 hits, 2 misses.

I cross off A in the first column, B in the second, etc.  You
can ONLY do this if there were 0 hits. Still you'll be amused.

OTHELLO.COM: Have you the patience to beat this one? 

PPONG.COM: fun H19/H89 game.  Deflect the ball with "/" and
"\".  I was amazed how fast it was on a 9600 baud terminal!

PRESSUP.COM: A challenging game, not quite as bad as Othello.

RALLY: This sounds so interesting I almost bought an H19.  If
I had actually seen it in operation, I bet I might.  Randy
Suess ran it and said it was excellent, except that the screen
flickered a bit due to lots of reverse video "...but I have an
older H19 and the new ones may be better".

STONE.COM: You get to specify how "hard" the computer works to
beat you, and if you let it work a while, it's nearly un-
beatable.

TABIFY.COM: A nice utility to delete spaces from a file, in-
serting tabs where appropriate, based on the CP/M convention.

TTT.COM:  Hmmm, what could be new in a Tic Tac Toe game?  Well,
brains, and wit for two things.  Ex: it puts its "X", you put
your "o", it thinks a while, and says "I've got ya".  If it
thinks for a while, and after several pieces are on the board,
doesn't say "I've got ya", then you MAY be on your way to a
rare win, or more likely a "cat" game.  Play it and see.
