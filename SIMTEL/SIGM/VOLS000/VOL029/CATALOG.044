SOFTWARE: CBASIC
HARDWARE: 96 COL. OR GREATER PRINTER IF YOU WISH HARDCOPY
DOC FILES:     LEDGER1.DOC & BUDGET1.DOC
The program is nicely written with good commenting.  All of 
the programs run and seem to work properly.  Error trapping 
could be improved.  LEDGER1 allows a rerun at the end, but 
this bombed for me. The main weakness of the program is the 
inadequate user prompts.  The BUDGETCH expects the user to 
remember the 20 letter that reference the expense catagories.  
The catagory discriptions are available as a user call from 
the BUDGET1 program.  It would be an improvement if the 
program provided the information without request in both 
BUDGET1 and BUDGETCH.  All in all--a usable program to enter 
monthly expense forthe home--after you get use to the required 
input formats.  LEDGER1 sign-off is a reference to a mythical 
state--somewhat akin to Camalot combined with Devil's Island.

DOC FILE: ROBO.DOC
     ROBO is a math drill (addition) for preschoolers and first-
graders.  It has a line of numbers provided that, I guess, save 
on the fingers and toe method I use.  This might make some 
teachers unhappy.  The programs is a nice little helper for
those learning beginning math.   Reviewer: Ken Prevo of CACHE

PROGRAMS: GENERAL LEDGER

This is the General Ledger series of programs published by
Osborne/McGraw-Hill.  It has received good reviews, it
compiles and runs on a Hazeltine terminal, but will require
modification if you use a different terminal.  See G/L.DOC
for further comments.	Jim Mills CACHE SIG CP/M
DOCUMENTATION ON BUDGET1

BUDGET1 is a source program in CBASIC (version 2) written by Patrick Cunning-
ham of San Antonio, TX [235 Sharon Drive, San Antonio 78216].  Suggestions on
improvements are solicited. I wrote it for a 48K ALTOS ACS8000 computer with
dual floppy (8" or 20 cm) drives. It probably will work with less memory.

To operate, compile the BUDGET1.BAS file using the CBASIC2 compiler.  Some
editing may be necessary to make this file compatible with other compilers.
Prompts will be displayed whenever necessary. Run when INT file is created.

BUDGET1 operates on 1-20 expense records, which are input by the operator.
Each of these records may be subdivided into several (max of 4) categories.
The program checks the addition used in allocating these categories.
These are then output onto CP/M based disc files in records that contain
the day of the transaction, payee, and category/amount for 1-4 categories.
The record length is 64 characters, so that random access to the files is
possible.  The program will add new expenses to the disc immediately after
any currrent expenses already logged.  The file created should have the
name EXPENSnn.XXX, where nn is the last two digits of the A.D. year and
XXX is the month code, such as JAN, FEB, MAR, APR, etc.

BUDGET1 has a built-in iteration prompt that allows the user to process
more than one month's expenses at the same time.  Category codes for each
of the nineteen categories (charity, food, mortgage, phone, etc.) are dis-
played in a menu upon user's request.

BUDGET1 may be freely copied for non-commercial distribution.  Under no
circumstances may it be sold for profit.  (C) copyright 1980 by Patrick
Cunningham.

BUDGET1 is accessed and totaled by the program LEDGER1.
GENERAL LEDGER DOCUMENTATION 11/06/80

You WILL need to purchase the book GENERAL LEDGER CBASIC by
Lon Poole, with Mary Borchers, Martin McNiff, and Robert
Thomson.  It is published by Osborne/McGraw-Hill and is
available in many computer stores and some book stores.  If
you are unable to find it any other way, you can usually
order it through a bookstore.

This disk contains a file called CBAS.SUB which is a submit
file for compiling the programs on this disk in proper
sequence.  Some of the .BAS files you see on the disk are
not listed in the .SUB file because they are subroutine
type programs that are loaded with the main programs using
the CBASIC2 %INCLUDE statement.

Two of the programs on the disk, CRTFM and FILEINIT are
utilities that you will use the first time you set up your
data files, and used seldom after that.

You will want to modify the CURSOR.BAS program for your CRT
-- CURSOR.BAS is set up for a Hazeltine terminal and if you
don't have a Hazeltine, then you'll have to make some changes.
SUBS1.BAS also has some cursor positioning routines in it
that you may need to modify.  These modifications will require
a good deal of familiarity with the manual and the operation
of your CRT as opposed to a Hazeltine.  Familiarity with
CBASIC2 programming is also required.

After you have compiled the programs, you will want to
put all the .INT files on a blank disk, perhaps with CRUN2.

Refer to the book for operating instructions.  G/L000 is the
menu program.

Good luck.

                          ROBO.
ROBO is an addition program I wrote for my seven year old daughter, Amy.
It presents the learner with a number line (lamentably a bit too small for
the entire range of values generated) and with random pairs of numbers to
add together.  It gives a bit of positive feedback for correct answers and
four opportunities to guess or calculate the right answer before giving up
and presenting a brand new problem.  At the end of the program the total
number of right and wrong answers are presented and the student is encour-
aged to run the program again.

The numbers generated are all integers.  With a bit of modification, the
program can be made to generate negative integers or real numbers for more
advanced students.
