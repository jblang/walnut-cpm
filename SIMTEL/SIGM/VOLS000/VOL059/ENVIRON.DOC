	The C version of PISTOL was developed with BDS C,
version 1.44. On an Exidy Sorcerer personal Computer with the
S-100 expansion box.  The Thinker Toys 2D dual 8" disk sub-
system was used and total contiguous ram was 52K.  Statistics
from the BDS compiler indicated at least 14K left over at every
stage.  Thus it may be possible to recompile this in a 40K
system.

	I/O requirements are minimal.  A dumb terminal (video
or printing) and the CP/M disk interface are sufficient.

	In use, the user may wish to customize PISTOL by
declaring his actual screen width (I have defaulted to 64).
Also the output scrolls and pauses after a fixed number of
lines (my default is 20?).  To continue, hit return, to abort
type "q" before "return".  Even the tab size for display is
user alterable.  See the documentation about the "system
variables": TERMINAL-WIDTH , TERMINAL-LENGTH , and TAB-SIZE .

	Because of the large external variable use, PISTOL,
in its current form, needs about 40K of ram to run, so one
might assume a 48K CP/M machine is recommended.

	If the code in C seems cumbersome in spots, it is be-
cause I have learned 'C' to translate PISTOL.PAS (PASCAL) only
very recently (since Jan 1, 1982). I would appreciate any
constructive criticisms and suggestions.
