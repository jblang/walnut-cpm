     BONANZA!!!!  This  is the third disk in our series that  has 
been  submitted by a single  donator.  I am very happy to release 
this  disk  from Peter Grogono.  He has been one of  my  favorite 
authors ever since I started studying Pascal. He definitely knows 
what he is talking about.  But here,  let him explain his disk to 
you himself.

This disk contains five Pascal/Z programs: 
1. Two general purpose utilities.
     a.PRINT 
     b.FF
2. Two Pascal development aids.
     a. PP 
     b. XREF
3. And a text processor.
     a. TP.  
The  assembly  language  and other Pascal/Z  files  on  the  disk 
contain procedures used by these programs.  The file that you are 
now reading exists in two forms on the disk: DISK.DOC is obtained 
by running TP with DISK.TEX as input.

These programs have been donated to the Z User's Group.  They are 
guaranteed  only to do what I want them to do on my system.   Use 
them,alter them, and give them away to friends, but please do not 
attempt to market them.   If they were saleable products, I would 
have sold them.  If you make substantial improvements to them  or 
discover substantial bugs in them, please let me know.

(NOTE: Because of space limitations on this disk, the remainder
of Mr. Grogono's explanation of these prorgrams has been 
deleted from this file. It appears in full under the title
DISK.DOC)
