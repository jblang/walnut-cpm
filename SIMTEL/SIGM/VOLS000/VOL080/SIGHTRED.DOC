                              Program notes 

1.  Purpose.  The SIGHTRED program contains the formulae for performing the
spherical triangle calculations associated with celestial navigation.    My
primary purpose in writing this program was to use it  for  preparation  of
sight reduction problems for the class I teach in celestial  navigation  at
the local  community  college.    While  the  use  to  date  is  solely  in
preparation for class, the program would work in an operational  situation.
Its performance matches  that  of  special  purpose  calculators,  both  in
accuracy and speed.  The navigation terminology  is  standard  and  can  be
found in any text on the subject.  Best reference is NO  Pub  #9,  American
Practical Navigator, originally by Nathanial Bowditch.  

2.  Compatibility.  While written in Pascal/Z, there are  no  terminal   or
file peculiarities, so any Pascal compiler should handle it.
