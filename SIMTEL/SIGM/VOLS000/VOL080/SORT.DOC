1.  Purpose.  I modified the NAD-3 set of programs in Volume 11 to suit the
following need.  Messages and letters in the Coast Guard are marked with  a
Standard Subject Identifier Code (SSIC) and also contain a statement of the
subject matter near the top.  These two clues are the best when a  radioman
is  determining  who  to  route  incoming  messages  to  within  a  command
organization.  Records  containing  fields  titled  SUBJect,  SSIC,  Action
addressee, Info addressee are built and updated by a  modification  of  the
NAD-3 program.    That  program  collection  (ALPHABET)  is  also  used  to
alphabetize and print the list in order by subject.   SORT.PAS  (SRTPRT.PAS
is the printer subroutine to facilitate quick modification) sorts the  list
by SSIC and makes a second printout.  These two printouts,  posted  in  the
communications center, are referenced by the duty radioman.  

2.  The program.  This is a direct descendant of  the  ISORTV1  program  in
Volume 4.  Instead of short strings from the console, complete records from
a file are sorted using  an  insertion  sort.    Performance  in  terms  of
throughput is much faster than the algorithm used in  ALPHABET;  not  quite
sure why, but this works well.  The I/O  routines  are  Pascal/Z,  but  the
remainder should be standard.
