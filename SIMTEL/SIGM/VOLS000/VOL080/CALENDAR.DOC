			1982 CALENDARS

	In case you like the idea of printing out your own 
1982 calendars, the accompanying ".CAL" files give you two 
choices -- one is a modification of the 1981 "Snoopy" 
calendar from the Pascal/Z Users' Group, Volume 6, and the 
other is a "pinup girl", originally from the North Star 
Users' Group, Volume 1. The 1982 calendar, in each case, is
an update of the 1981 calendars which were available last 
year on the People's Message Service RBBS systems.
	The printer commands which have been added to each 
calendar file will print them out in proper format, without
modification, if you are using the "Magic Wand" word-
processing package and an 80-column printer, set for 6
lines (vertically) and 10 characters (horizontally) per 
inch. Other word processors and/or printers will require 
some modification to run these, but it shouldn't take much.
You may also want to try out different spacings or 
character styles, on printers which have those, to see what
they look like (printing the "picture" pages at 8 lines and
12.5 characters per inch on my Anadex, for example, seems 
to improve the quality of either one). With the print 
format shown here, it will take three 8.5" x 11" pages to 
print the "pinup", or two pages for the "Snoopy". With the 
"Magic Wand", also, any number of complete copies can be 
printed consecutively, with the "Copy" command.
	Finally, I should apologize to any members of the 
User's Group who are offended by the idea of a "pinup girl"
calendar (think of it as the product of a mind demented 
from too much programming). For those of you (such as 
women) with different sexual preferences, I would have 
given you equal time, with a male version, if I had one 
available. As it is, however, the only male model around is
me, and that would REALLY have been an indecent exposure.
