                                       INTRODUCTION

                    TED  is  a  simple,  easy-to-use, and yet powerful text

               editor designed for use with any standard CP/M  system  with

               24K bytes or more of memory. To use TED type:

                                      TED <filename>

                                            or

                                TED <filename>.<filetype>

               where <filename> specifies a standard CP/M file to be edited

               or  created.  An  omitted  file  name  is considered to be a

               filename of all blanks.

                    TED is "self-helping"  and  may  be  used  productively

               without further reference to this documentation!

                    TED is line-oriented, meaning that lines of text within

               the  file  may  be  referenced  by absolute or relative line

               numbers. Additionally, pattern search may be used to  locate

               a line and for global substition within a specified range of

               lines.  The  size of the file to be edited is not limited to

               internal buffer size. TED creates temporary  disk  files  to

               extend  the available buffer space. Version 1.1 limits files

               to 2048 lines of up to 128  characters  per  line  (slightly

               larger than the capacity of a standard 8-inch diskette).

                   Although  TED  is  a  general  purpose  editor, it has a

               companion  program  called  PRO.  PRO  is  a  powerful  test

               processor  for formatting textual information. This document

               was developed using both TED and PRO. PRO  commands  may  be

               referenced via the self-helping feature of TED.

                    All   the  edit  commands,  including  the  information

               request,  will  be  briefly  explained  in   the   following

               paragraphs.  Arguments  depicted  by  n1  and  n2 are signed

               integer numbers.

               Description:

                 The information request command provides  instructions  on

               the  use  of  TED  commands.  The  information  command  '?'

               followed by a carriage return,  prints  an  introduction  to

               TED,   and   instructions   for   obtaining   more  detailed

               information. The following is a list of information  command

               options.


                 ?               general information
                 ?a              append info

                 ?w              write file info

               A question mark '?' should appear in the first column of the

               line.  Blank  characters  or  tab  characters separating the

               question mark and the command character  are  ignored.  Only

               the first displayable character of a command is checked.

                                          APPEND

               Format:
                 a
                 <text>
                 .



               Description:

                 The  APPEND command is used to change the edit mode to the

               input mode. This command consists of an ASCII character  'a'

               followed  immediately  by a carriage return. TED will give a

               response: 'APPEND:' and a carriage return. Then TED is ready

               to accept input text.  New  lines  are  appended  after  the

               current  line. When a line containing only a period is typed

               the user is returned to the  EDIT  mode.  TED  will  give  a

               prompt  with 'EDIT:' followed by a carriage return, and edit

               level indicator '====>'.



               Example:

                 ====>a
                 APPEND:
                      This text is appended to the
                      current line. The input mode will be
                      ended by a line that contains a period only,
                      like the line below
                      .

                 [n1][,n2]d



               Operands:

                 n1............Beginning line number to be deleted. If  not

                               specified,  the  current line is assumed. If

                               preceded by a plus  or  minus  sign,  n1  is

                               added  to,  or  subtracted from, the current

                               line.

                 n2............Ending line number to  be  deleted.  If  not

                               specified, only one line is deleted.



               Description:

                 The  delete  command  is used to delete a line or group of

               lines in the  buffer.  The  line  following  the  last  line

               deleted becomes the current line.



               Example:

                 3d              deletes line number three.

                 3,6d            deletes lines number three through six.

                 ,+5d            deletes the current line through next 

                                 five lines.

                 d               deletes the current line.

                 <text>
                 .



               Description:

                 The INSERT command is used to insert an additional line or

               lines  before  the  current line. The input text is ended by

               typing a period alone at the beginning of a  line,  followed

               by  a  carriage return. This command differs from the APPEND

               command only in the placement of the input text.



               Example:

                 ====>i
                 INSERT:
                      This text is inserted prior to
                      the current line.

                               a plus or minus sign, n1  is  added  to,  or

                               subtracted from, the current line.

                 n2............The  destination  to  where the line must be

                               copied. If preceded by a plus or minus sign,

                               n2 is added  to,  or  subtracted  from,  the

                               current line.



               Description:

                 The  COPY  command  is used to copy the line specified, to

               the line destination. This  new  line  becomes  the  current

               line.  If the destination line is greater than the last line

               number, this line will be appended to the last line  in  the

               file.

                               a slash.



                 pattern.......The string pattern to be searched for.



               Description:

                 The LOCATE command is  used  to  locate  the  first  line,

               starting with the line following the current line, which has

               the  occurance of the pattern specified. If the last line is

               reached and no pattern is matched, TED will  prompt  with  a

               message  - 'CANNOT FIND:' followed by the pattern specified.

               If locate is successful, the line  will  be  displayed,  and

               becomes the current line.



               Example:

                 n2............The new  location  of  the  moved  line.  If

                               preceded  by  a  plus  or  minus sign, n2 is

                               added to, or subtracted  from,  the  current

                               line.



               Description:

                 The  MOVE command is used to move a line from one location

               to another. The new location of the line becomes the current

               line. This line is removed from the old location.



               Example:

                 ====>11,20m
                   20 (the moved line is displayed here).

               Operands:

                 n1............The beginning line to be displayed.

                 n2............The last line to be displayed.

                 +.............The line after the current line.

                 -.............The line prior to the current line.

                 :.............Displays 16 lines starting from the  current

                               line.



               Description:

                 The  print  lines command requests TED to type out a group

               of  one  or  more  lines.  A  carriage  return  without  any

               character preceding it, prints the current line.



               Example:

                 ====>1,5           prints line one through line five.

                 ====>,+9           prints 10 lines starting from the current

                                    line.

                 ====>25            prints line number 25.

                 q



               Description:

                 The  quit command is used to exit the edit session without

               altering the source file. All current editting is lost. As a

               precaution, TED will prompt with  the  message  "WRITE?????"

               whenever the first entry of the quit command is requested. A

               subsequent quit command ends the edit session.



               Example:

                 ====>q
                 WRITE????
                 ====>q

               Operands:

                 /.............delimiter,  any displayable character may be

                               used instead of a slash character.

                 n1............the beginning line of substitution.  If  not

                               specified the current line is assumed.

                 n2............the  ending  line of substitution. n2 should

                               be greater than n1

                 pattern.......the pattern to be replaced.

                 repl..........the replacement string. The null  string  is

                               included.

                 g.............global replacement indicator.



               Description:

                 The  substitute command is used to search for an occurance

               of  the  specified  pattern,  and  replace   it   with   the

               replacement  string. If the replacement is made, the line is

               displayed. If no occurance is found, TED  gives  a  message:

               "CANNOT   FIND:   'pattern'."   If  the  global  replacement

               indicator is used, all occurances of  the  pattern  in  each

               line  are  replaced.  Line length is truncated to 128 if the

               resulting replacement makes the line length overflow.

                 The write file command writes the updated  disk  file  and

               deletes  temporary  files.  No backup file is created. After

               the file is written, control is returned  to  the  operating

               system.

                                      ERROR MESSAGES



               DESCRIPTION:

                 TED's error messages are self-explanatory, for example: if

               you attempt to write to a disk which already has 256 records

               on it TED will respond with the message 'DISK FULL'. If your

               directory   is  full  TED  will  respond  with  the  message

               'DIRECTORY SPACE FULL'. These types of errors are considered

               fatal, and in the case of fatal errors TED  will  print  the

               error  message  and  return  to CP/M. If this occurs you may

               find you have two working files on your  disk,  NEW.$$$  and

               REV.$$$.  Since  these  files  take up disk space during the

               edit session you may run out of disk space much sooner  then

               you  might have imagined! It is recommended that you have at

               least 2.5 times as much space on the disk as the size of the

               file you are intending to edit. If  you  have  made  several

               changes to your file and you get a 'DISK FULL' error you may

               be  able  to  recover  some  of the changes you have made by

               inspecting the first part of your NEW.$$$ file.  It  may  or

               may not contain the latest changes made. If it does, you may

               combine it with the original file using the PIP command.

                 The following errors are fatal errors:-


                      FILE EXTENSION ERROR
                      DISK FULL
                      DIRECTORY SPACE FULL
                      DISK ERROR
                      CLOSE NEWFILE ERROR
                      CLOSE REVFILE ERROR
                      CLOSE OLDFILE ERROR

                      MEMORY OVERFLOW(CP/M SYSTEM IS TOO SMALL FOR TED)

                 In  addition  to the fatal errors there are various errors

               in command format. These are not considered fatal errors and

               TED  will  wait  for  further  input   after   printing   an

               appropriate  error message. The non-fatal errors include the

               following:-


                      MISSING OPERAND
                      NO SUCH LINE(ON DELETE COMMANDS)
                      INVALID COMMAND

                 TED is a modified version of ED  an  editor  designed  and

               implemented  by  LTCOL  Triyono  at  the  Naval Postgraduate

               School as part of his thesis research. ED  was  designed  to

               run  on  the ISIS-II operating system and was part of a TEXT

               processing  system  entered  in  the  Intel  Insite  library

               contest which eventually won the grand prize.

                 Many  of  the  data  structures  used  in  ED and TED were

               originally designed by professor Gary  Kildall.  LCDR  Frank

               Burkhead  served  as  LTCOL  Triyono's  thesis  advisor  and

               contributed  his  guidance   and   experience   during   the

               development  of  the  original  system. Alterations to ED to

               allow TED to run on CP/M were made by LT Mark Moranville and

               LCDR Frank Burkhead.  Further  information  on  TED  may  be
