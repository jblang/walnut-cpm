                    CONTENTS OF VOLUME 16

     I am continuely being surprised by the diverse donations that 
are  submitted  by our members.  This disk varies from a  Cancer 
Research Professor in Hawaii to a Coast Guard Officer in  Oregon. 
Don't get me wrong, I love it. Here's hoping you will too.

1.   James Bearden,  of Hawaii,  had to really work at contacting 
     us.  His  North  Star would not run our disks so he  had  to 
     modem them to a local member,  who then modemed them to a 8" 
     friend,  who in turn gave them to me. So James was certainly 
     serious about his donation. 

     ARTIL.DOC      This is a simulation of an artillery battle
     ARTIL/Z.COM    between two players--the source is in
     ARTIL/Z.PAS    Pascal/M and Pascal/Z.Besides being a 
     ARTIL/M.PAS    computer game for two people(unlike most
                    available, which are for one person against
                    the computer)and the kind of game which
                    requires more thought than luck(usually)
                    it shows some programming techniques that
                    may be useful. A comparsion between Z and
                    M is always interesting also.

     SAMPLE.DOC     If you like to compare speed records for
     SAMPLE/C.BAS   your software and/or hardware agaist other
     SAMPLE/C.C     people's, here are two more in six different
     SAMPLE/C.COM   languages. 
     SAMPLE/M.PAS
     SAMPLE/N.BAS
     SAMPLE/S.BAS
     SAMPLE/S.COM
     SAMPLE/Z.COM
     SAMPLE/Z.PAS
                    
     GOTOXY.PSP     Translations of two of the console-control
     CONACT.PSP     procedures from Pascal/M and UCSD.Used on
     CONSOLE.DOC    the Micro-Term ACT-IV. Duplicates functions
                    of GOTOXY and CONACT.
        
     RANDON.PSP     Taken from PROGRAMMING IN PASCAL, by Peter 
                    Grogono, pp. 117-119,with "Modulus" reduced 
                    to "Maxint" to accommodate Pascal/Z limits.
                    Returns a pseudo-random number between 0 and 
                    1.0, inclusive, and should generate "Maxint" 
                    (32767) such numbers before repeating itself.

     CALENDAR.DOC   Some more calenders but nice to have anyway.
     PINUP82.CAL
     SNOOPY82.CAL

2.    Rex  Buddenberg,  of the Coast Guard,  teaches  and  he 
     found a good use for these programs in school.

     SIGHTRED.DOC   This program contains the formulae for
     SIGHTRED.COM   performing the spherical triangle
     SIGHTRED.PAS   calculations associated with celestial 
                    naviagation. It has practical value.
  
     SORT.DOC       Rex modified the NAD-3 program to suit
     SORT.PAS       a Coast Guard Radio Room need. An interest-
     SRTPRT.PAS     ing application and one everyone should
                    look at just out of curosity.

     TED.COM	    Rex sez he uses this simple Editor all the
     TED.DOC        time, its Public Domain and it you don't
		    have any, this will do since the price is
		    right.

3.  Those two almost filled a disk by themselves. The following
    program is a filler, but has something to offer.

     CHECKLN.PAS    For those who are building modules for
     CHECKLN.COM    acoounting packages, this can be a good
		    seed. It will take a dollar figure and
		    print out its equivilant in text. I would
		    say it could end up as a check writing
		    component.
