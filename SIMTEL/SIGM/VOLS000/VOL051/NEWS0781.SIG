        Cash Memory

        Bill  Chin sends this treasurer's report for those 
        who want to know our financial situation.   Here's 
        how it adds up as of May 1, 1981:

             Income

             Balance of SIG/M account      $    782.41
             Deposits                      $   1892.00

                                   Total   $   2674.41
             
             Expenses                 
             
                  Telephone                $     23.69
                  Postage                        70.59
                  Diskettes                    2452.89
                  Other                         250.00
                  Bank Charges                   39.84

                                   Total   $   2837.01                

                            Net position   $  ( 162.60)

        Note that this report does not include a number of 
        unprocessed  prepaid  orders which came  in  after 
        Bill wrote the report.   When these are processed, 
        we should be solidly "in the black".


        CATalog

        The  SIG/M post office box continues to be flooded 
        with requests for our catalog.   With the  library 
        up to 25 volumes and more on the way,  the catalog 
        has  exceeded the capacity of a normal letter-size 
        envelope and 1/2 ounce postage.   We are therefore 
        requesting  that  a large (9 x  12)  envelope  and 
        fifty  (50)  cents postage accompany  all  catalog 
        requests.   Without this,  you're cutting into our 
        lunch money!

        There  are  a couple of other ways of getting  the 
        catalog.  These are:

        1.  If you have a modem, copy the catalog from any 
        Remote  CP/M  system.   Most  of these  carry  our 
        catalog   and  the  most  recent   SIG/M   Report.  
        ACGNJers  can  check the staff page of  the  ACGNJ 
        News for the Cranford, NJ and Allentown, PA system 
        numbers.

        2.  Buy  the  combined  CPMUG  and  SIG/M  catalog 
        printed  and distributed by the New  York  Amateur 
        Computer  Club (NYACC).   This may be ordered  for 
        $10 (domestic) or $12 (overseas) from: NYACC, P.O. 
        Box 106,  New York,  NY  10008,  or picked up at a 
        meeting for $8.


        Disk Copying

        If   you  attended  one  of  the  last  few  SIG/M 
        meetings,  then  you know how heavy the  load  has 
        become.  Howard Fingerhut, our faithful at-meeting 
        copyer,   has  been  taking  home  more  and  more 
        "homework" diskettes every month.   Therefore,  he 
        has asked that from now on,  members should please 
        limit  themselves to two disks copied per meeting.  
        If you need (?) more than this, you may buy ready-
        made copies for $4 each or swap a NEW blank floppy 
        for a copy for $1.   These last two apply to disks 
        picked up at MEETINGS ONLY.


        SIG/M Elections

        The  big news this month is that SIG/M is  holding 
        its first elections of officers.   The terms  will 
        begin  immediately  and run until  December  1982.  
        After that time,  SIG/M officer terms will run for 
        one year, similarly to the regular ACGNJ officers.  
        Elections will be held for the offices of:

                             Chairman
                          Vice-Chairman
                            Secretary
                            Treasurer

        And  about half a dozen assorted committee  heads.  
        Nominations  were  held for Chairman at  the  June 
        meeting,  and  will  be re-opened at the  July  10 
        meeting.   The  non-winning  candidates  for  each 
        office are automatically nominated for each  lower 
        position unless they elect to decline.  Additional 
        nominations will be taken for each office prior to 
        each vote.  The present nominees for chairman are:

        Bruce Ratoff         Bill Chin        Bill Earnest
        Howard Fingerhut     Henry Kee        Ray Glueck


        Getting Used by the Users Group

        Last week,  unofficial word reached our ears  that 
        the   CP/M  Users  Group  run  by  Tony  Gold  and 
        sponsored by Lifeboat Associates was preparing  to 
        incorporate  SIG/M's  software library into  their 
        own  WITHOUT OUR KNOWLEDGE OR  PERMISSION.   Since 
        that   time,   I   have  had   several   telephone 
        conversations  with  Tony,   Ed  Currie  (also  of 
        Lifeboat),  and Jim Mills and Ward Christensen (of 
        CACHE  SIG-CP/M,  who does most of the  cataloging 
        and abstracting for CPMUG.   The CACHE people told 
        me that they were not involved at all.   Tony  and 
        Ed  both insisted that no public  announcement  or 
        distribution   would   have  been   done   without 
        consulting  us,  and  asked that SIG/M  supply  an 
        official statement of our position on the subject.  


        The  following letter is the result of our June 12 
        meeting, and was mailed to CPMUG Monday, June 15.

        June 14, 1981

        Mr. Anthony R. Gold
        CP/M Users Group
        1651 Third Avenue
        New York, NY  10028

        Dear Tony

        First  of all,  let me thank you and Ed  for  your 
        quick telephone response to my inquiries regarding 
        CPMUG's use of the SIG/M Software Library.  As you 
        requested,  I  have  placed  the  question  of  an 
        acceptable   method  of  distribution  before  the 
        general  membership of SIG/M at the  meeting  held 
        Friday,  June  12,  1981.   After much  debate,  a 
        resolution was unanimously passed, authorizing the 
        CP/M  Users Group operated by you and sponsored by 
        Lifeboat   Associates  to  distribute  the   SIG/M 
        Software   Library,   subject  to  the   following 
        conditions:

        1.  Each  volume  must be identified only  by  its 
        SIG/M volume number,  in the diskette's  contents, 
        on  its  external  label,  and in any  mention  in 
        printed or machine-readable catalogs.   This means 
        that  you are explicitly requested not  to  assign 
        CPMUG  volume  numbers to our  material.   We  are 
        certain  that this represents no hardship to  you, 
        in  view of the many organizations that  currently 
        maintain  both  libraries  with  their  respective 
        numbering systems.

        2.  Each volume must remain intact, as released by 
        SIG/M,  with no files added,  deleted,  renamed or 
        altered  in  content.   It is requested  that  the 
        files  contained  on these volumes be  distributed 
        solely on their respective SIG/M volumes,  and not 
        transferred  to  or incorporated into  present  or 
        future CPMUG library volumes.

        3. The fee charged by CPMUG for these volumes must 
        not  exceed the true cost of  media,  copying  and 
        mailing.   It  is expected that this fee will  not 
        exceed the fee charged for CPMUG volumes.

        4.  CPMUG  is  authorized to append a  catalog  of 
        SIG/M  Library  volumes  to the catalog  of  CPMUG 
        library volumes,  provided that the SIG/M  titling 
        and    numbering   is   retained   as   the   only 
        identification of these volumes.

        The above conditions are exactly the same as those 
        requested  of  the many  other  organizations  who 
        currently distribute the SIG/M library.   As these 
        other   organizations   have  no   difficulty   or 
        objection  in  adhering to our wishes,  it is  our 
        hope that CPMUG will do likewise.

        A  second  resolution was passed at  our  meeting, 
        coordially inviting you,  Ed Currie, and any other 
        interested parties at Lifeboat, Lifelines or CPMUG 
        to become a member of ACGNJ and SIG/M.  We believe 
        that your participation in our activities would be 
        of  great mutual benefit,  and hope that you  will 
        consider our invitation favorably.

        Thank you again for your time and interest.

        Yours truly

        Bruce R. Ratoff
        Vice-chairman

        I  hope to be able to publish Tony's reply in  our 
        next  column.   He has indicated that this  letter 
        and  his reply will also appear in a future  issue 
        of Lifelines magazine.


        That's it for this month.   Hope your enjoying the 
        summer.  Keep cool!
                                              Bruce
