1) ANDMSK.SRC- AN EXTERNAL FUNCTION WHICH WILL DO A BIT-BY-BIT
	LOGICAL 'AND' FUNCTION OF ITS TWO INTEGER ARGUMENTS.

2) COMPARE.*- A PROGRAM WHICH WILL DO A  COMPARE OF TWO  DIFFERENT 
	FILES AND LOG THE DIFFERENCES IN A THIRD FILE. ( NOTE THAT
	CHARACTER COUNT IS IN DECIMAL WHILE THE CHARACTERS ARE 
	IN HEXADECIMAL. )

	I CREATED THIS PROGRAM AFTER I USED THE CK.COM FILE FROM A
	PREVIOUS USER'S GROUP DISK BECAUSE THE CK PROGRAM SAID THE TWO
	FILES WERE THE SAME. MY PROGRAM SAID AN ENTIRE SECTOR WAS BAD.
	( I'D LIKE TO SEE THE SOURCE OF THAT PROGRAM AND FIND OUT WHY
	THE ALGORITHM DIDN'T FIND SUCH AN OBVIOUS PROBLEM).

3) EXORG.SRC- AN EXTERNAL FUNCTION THAT WILL RETURN THE ADDRESS OF
	THE ARGUMENT VARIABLE. VERY USEFUL FOR DMA TO GET AN ARRAY'S
	ADDRESS.

4) ORMSK.SRC- AN EXTERNAL FUNCTION THAT WILL RETURN A LOGICAL
	BIT-BY-BIT 'OR' OF THE TWO INTEGER ARGUMENTS.

5) REMOTE.SRC- AN EXTERNAL PROCEDURE DESIGNED TO BE USED WITH THE
	SCITRONICS/BSR HOME REMOTE CONTROL UNITS. ONE INPUTS THE
	HOUSE CODE, UNIT CODE AND THE FUNCTION TYPE AND THIS PROCEDURE
	WILL PERFORM THE FUNCTION THRU THE SCITRONICS CONTROLLER.
