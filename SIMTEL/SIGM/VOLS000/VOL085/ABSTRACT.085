                    CONTENTS OF VOLUME #19

1.      It is always nice to give others a program or two but the 
better reward is to have those people return your programs bigger 
and  better.  That  is the case in this volume.  I had written  a 
tutorial   Pascal tree and donated it to the  group.  Ray  Penley 
returned it with Tree4 and we saw great improvements. Now we have 
a  near final version,  Tree5 by Rex Buddenberg.  It maintains  a 
sorted list in a binary tree.  It is always possible to improve a 
program  and  I  certain hope we continue this  trend  with  this 
program.  But  it  now has disk storage,  deletion and  relinking 
ability. Rex has done a good job. 

TREE5.COM/PAS/DOC        The main program
DISC.PAS                 Procedures for reading and writing the
                         leaves to disc file.
ORDER.PAS                Procedures for traversing the tree.
DELETE.PAS               Procedures for removing a record and
                         relinking what is left.
MENU.PAS                 Utility routines.
DATA.DAT

     Rex has also done some converting. The following program was 
converted  from  basic.  It prints a string of seven  letters  in 
large  format- 10 X 7 of normal characters.  He explains some  of 
his  trials  and  errors which all contribute  to  a  interesting 
effort.  It  should  give  you some good ideas for things  to  do 
yourself.

SIGNS.COM/DOC/PAS
FONT.DAT                 This is how Rex filled the font.

2.    Iron-Fingers  Penley  has been at it  again.  This  program 
called  RUNOFF  is a text formatting program  patterned  somewhat 
after the Runoff for the DEC PDP-11. The commands available are a 
subset of those available in the original PDP-11 version also the 
command  formats and actions are the same as the PDP-11  version. 
However, there some new commands so look it over.

RUNOFF.COM/DOC/PAS/SUB

Ray  had  sent  the following programs several weeks  ago  but  I 
couldn't  fit them in until now.  So this disk will be almost all 
of  Ray's donations.  In answer to some user letters and his  own 
curosity ,the following programs were created to answer a need.

PASDIR.COM/PAS           Allows user program to call directory.
REMOVECC.COM/PAS         Will remove or change control characters
                         also find Hi-bit or strip Hi-bit.
TRIMCOLS.COM/PAS         Trims right column or trailing blanks.
SUPERSUB.COM/ASM         Public domain up-date of Submit, it is
                         enhanced and is to be used with XSUB
XSUB.COM/PAS             Execute external programs via a Submit
                         program generated with the user program.

PAUSE.COM/SRC            Short routine to print a message to
                         the console, wait for any keypressed
                         then return immediately to program.
