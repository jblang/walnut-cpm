     It  is  always  a  pleasure  to  welcome  new  members  with 
donations  to  share.  This  issue has a range of interest  so  I 
couldn't  classify this disk into any one  category.  We'll  just 
call it general then.

1.   Craig Rudlin has written a program that creates a dictionary 
   of words and/or short phrases so you can communicate in plain 
   Enlish with the computer. It also compiles a list of patients
   with specific diagnoses, s/p prcedures, tests, etc; and assign
   specific tests and protocols to laboratory specimens. Read the
   DOC for in-depth info.

2.  Leonard Farwell worked with Ray Penley to solve his Epson 
  printer problems so these programs are the result.

     SUB.COM/PAS  -  a  menu file to run the major  CP/M  command 
                     files.
     HOLD.COM/PAS -  a file to go with SUB to keep responses from
                     scrolling off the screen. (for the program
                     to function properly, the CP/M commands:
                     SUBMIT,PIP,STAT,SYSGEN AND FORMAT, need to
                     be on the same disk with SUB AND HOLD).
     EPSON.COM/PAS-  a  menu  file  to  send  code  to  Epson  MX 
                     printers  for compressed  print,  emphasized 
                     print etc.
     OKI.COM/PAS  -  a menu file to send code to Okidata 82/83
                     printers for compressed print etc.

3.  David Cortesi has donated a really interesting program
  called INDEXER. It is a machine aid to create an index for any
  book or other situation where an index would be benifitical .It
  does the job of the pile of index cards normally used and it
  makes the finished index automatically, as a disk file that 
  can be edited and printed. He even enclosed a small sample.

4.   Peter  Grogono has submitted this small program to follow up 
     on his article in Newsletter #12. It returns the difference
     in value between the top of the heap and the stack as an 
     integer value. It'll keep you from running out of memory
     without warning.

5.  Ron Tornambe has written us an article and now he has
  donated an interesting Pascal program to scan the Directory.
