The file with the "h" in its name is as the name
suggests a version of the SAM76 language
assembled to operate at 8000 HEX. You may chose
to put this in rom or ram above a 32 K CPM
system, or better yet give copies of it to your
diskless impecunious friends and sucker them in
to get the book and learn all about SAM76.

Don't forget to zeroize the "POA" location if your
friend does not really have a disk or he
will get strange things when doing the "@@f" function.
