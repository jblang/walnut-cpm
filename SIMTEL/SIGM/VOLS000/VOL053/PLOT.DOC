PLOT.ASM is the source program of the overlay to
the SAM76 interpreter to permit the plotting of
vector graphics either on a "calcomp type"
plotter or a display of the "POLY88/TRS80" type.

It is currently setup for use at A800 hex, but can
be placed anywhere by changing the value of
PLT76. If Z80 is set equal to 0 then 8080 code is
generated, if set to 1, then Z80 code is used.

Note that the address pointed to by one of the
overlay pointers of SAM76 {POA, POB, POC, or POD}
must point to the selected address for the
PLOT overlay, or be set to 0 if the overlay is
not in place.
