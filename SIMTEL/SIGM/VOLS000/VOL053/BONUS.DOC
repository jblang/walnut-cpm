This version of SAM76 brings you a very special treat

when using the SAM76 language it is

NOT NOT NOT NOT NOT necessary to worry about
how you may move SAM files from one diskette
to another, particularly if you only have one
disk drive (like me).

Merely flip the drive open after having
brought into memory the desired file
using the %bf,filename/ function, then remove
the diskette, slide in a fresh one, close the
door and execute the %uf,filename/ function
- preceded of course by an %ef,filename/ function
if file of same name on disk as evidenced by
message {nav-uf-aef} telling you about an
already existing file.
