As a special treat this version of the SAM76
language contains approximately 50 functions
which have not yet been described anywhere.

Watch for Doctor Dobbs or put yourself on
the list to get advance preprints by sending
me a prestamped envelope self
adressed (to yourself of course) which
contains one dollar. This will entitle you
to receive the next upcoming preprint and
then you can recurse {note the re in front
of the preceding word}.

In particular be careful of the XU function.

A list of the subfunctions of XU is obtained
by doing &xu,lf, /, and the XU subfunctions
are performed thus %xu,mm,1000,1200,6000/
will simply move memory starting at 1000
through 1200 into 6000.

likewise, VM - verify memory, DM duplicate (fill) memory
etc. . .

You can get a list of functions in the disk overlay
by executing the "lff" list file function.

Be careful not to use the following recklessly
until the description has been published:

%xrs,unit,track,sector/     X read sector
%xws,unit,track,sector/     X write sector
%xbf,filename/              X bring file
%xuf,filename/              X update file
%dif,filename/              Designate Input File
%dof,filename/              Designate Output File
%rfr,/                      Read File Record
%wfr,text/                  Write File Record
%sic,channel/               Select Input Channel
%soc,channel/               Select Output Channel
The "ti" time and "sti" set time functions will
work properly if you have a COMPTEK clock, with a port
adress of 250.
