3. The control C and %ex/ exits return to the SELECTED
Monitor. Normally these  take you back to CP/M;

If you have used CPMSET the Selected monitor
will be CP/M, if you use ZAPSET, then ZAPPLE is
invoked. You may change these by changing the
contents of location 100D and 100E to reflect
the location you wish to reach on a control C or %ex/
function.
4. To get back into SAM after either a control C or %ex/
function - if in your monitor then G to 100, if in CPM
execute the zero length program called REE for Reenter.

If you use ZAPSET, the normal Zapple monitor IOSET and
IOCHK functions will be invoked. If your CPM system
sustains the appropriate BDOS calls then all is well.

If you have peculiar CBIOS conditions then you can cause
automatic initialization whenever entering or reentering
SAM by placing the adress of your INIT program at
^H102B and 102C.
