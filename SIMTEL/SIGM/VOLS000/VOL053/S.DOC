"S.COM" is an example of the use of SAM76 in autorun
mode of operation. In effect "S.COM" is nothing
more than (in this case ILRAW primed with CPMSETL)
a version of the SAM76 interpreter which has been
reloaded prior to saving with a script written to
recognize a command string and act on it.

Procedure is as follows:

1. Bring in a copy of SAM76, either through the
sequence ZLRAW/ILRAW and CPMSETL/ZAPSETL or if you
prefer just S.

2. Bring the file "G.SAM" thus:

%bf,g.sam/=

3. Examine the text "G" that has been brought in
and desirably analyze it - use %vt,G/=.

4. Execute G thus:	%G/=

5. This will take you back to the operating system
and now save the file thus:  SAVE 63 xxx.COM.

Use of xxx.COM allows you to specify a command string
which is examined by "G" in the following manner:

xxx yyy drive

where xxx is the name of the file you saved,
and  yyy is a file (yyy.sam) which contains the script
you wish to invoke, the first of which must be named
upper case "A" (at least as long as you do not change G).
and drive is the drive number on which yyy.sam exists.

If you omit drive, then drive 0 is assumed, if you omit
yyy then you will get SAM76 in its normal form.
