5. The upper limit of workspace that SAM will
assume is just below your CCP. This is determined by the
fact that location "TAM + OPV" contains 0.

There are two ways to change this limit: the first way is
ephemeral and lasts only while you are using SAM
and consists of executing the &cws,HEXLOC/ 
function, where HEXLOC is the current desired upper limit
of workspace - be sure to use upper case symbols
when telling SAM about hexadecimal adresses.

The second way is permanent and not dependent on the size of
your CP/M system, and that is to replace the zeroes at
TAM - OPV and at TAM with a fixed adress - this is done
either with the monitor functions &c. or using SAM thus:

%xwp,%xal,tam,%xal,opv//,HEXLOC/

expression. The foregoing changes the permanent table
which only is effective upon the next reentry into SAM.



6. Other general information is contained in "SAM"
organized files which you can access easily using SAM.

After you have successfully started up SAM as evidenced by
receiving a line feed with no other message - and proven it
by typing something followed by an equal sign and getting
the something vomited back at you,
then you can use the SAM file functions to bring in and
view the texts they contain.

Be sure to either specify the appropriate extension in
your file commands, or to preset the extension using
the %sfe,EXT/ command where EXT is the desired
extension. Note that EXT may be either symbols, or ???
or even nothing as in %sfe/; if you have set up the latter
the execution of the list file function &lf, / will
display your directory - horizontally,
and %lf,{linefeed}/ vertically.
