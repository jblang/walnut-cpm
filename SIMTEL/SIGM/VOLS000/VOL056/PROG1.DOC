IV. PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS

This section of the manual describes the operation and use of each
program in Musicraft.


IV.A. SETUP


IV.A.1. Command Sequence

A>^^SETUP^(press^return)


IV.A.2. Discussion

You must run SETUP before you attempt to use EDIT. SETUP
constructs a configuration file which is used by all other
programs. This file consists of one record which contains
the following information:

{m:2
{i:-8
1.
CPU type
{i:-8
2.
CPU clock speed
{i:-8
3.
DAC address
{i:-8
4.
Absolute cursor function parameters
{i:-8
5.
CRT clear functions
{i:-8
6.
Keyboard function keys
{i:-8
7.
Printer characteristics

{m:1
Before attempting to run SETUP, read and fill out the worksheet
provided in Appendix A. It is recommended that you
use pencil in filling out the worksheet so that you can make
corrections or updates as needed. Once you have completed the
worksheet, run SETUP.

When you run SETUP, you must make sure that the Musicraft System
diskette is on the default drive to insure that the configuration
file will be placed on the system diskette.

Unless some aspect of the characteristics of your system changes,
you will need to run
SETUP only once for a system diskette.


{c:VERY IMPORTANT NOTE

In general, whenever 
you operate the system, it is necessary to have the system diskette 
reside on the default drive so that the programs can
successfully retrieve the configuration file.


IV.B. EDIT


IV.B.1. Command Sequence

A>^^EDIT^songname^(press^return)


IV.B.2. Introduction

The editor is an in-memory editor. If the song named in the calling
sequence has been stored on floppy disk, EDIT will
retrieve the song into working storage in main memory. If the
song is new, EDIT will ask that the number of voices be
entered. You may enter 1, 2, 3, or 4 followed by a carriage return
in response. From this moment, the number of voices associated with
the song is fixed at this number.

Two pseudo_option lines will always appear in conjunction with a 
song which is displayed for edit. These two lines are not part of the 
song but are "terminal" lines. EDIT permits you to insert song 
lines and option lines between the terminal lines but never outside 
them. EDIT permits no way of placing the cursor beyond either of 
them. The construction of a song involves inserting the 
song lines needed to represent the song using the Insert_mode of 
EDIT. Therefore, even a new song will always have the two terminal 
lines:

{l:        *da capo
{l:        *da end


IV.B.3. Tutorial

This section will introduce to you some of the characteristics
of EDIT. We'll assume that you are at your CRT and that you
have already run SETUP, answering all questions asked by it. Computer
displays will be shown indented while your responses, where called
for, will be doubly indented. In the course of the discussion, it
may prove necessary to rerun SETUP. Whenever this need becomes
apparent, rerun SETUP and begin the exercise at the top to insure
that you have run SETUP correctly in all aspects.

Place your work disk in drive A, boot up, if necessary, then type:

A>^^EDIT^INVENT1^(press^return)

INVENT1 is the piece you played when you were checking out the system 
in the INITIAL CHECKOUT section.

The screen should clear and the following message should appear
at the top of your screen:

Loading song. Please stand by.

{m:2
If the screen does not clear, you must rerun SETUP giving it
the correct answer for the clear screen function for your
terminal. Also, if only a portion (or none) of the message is 
displayed, then rerun SETUP specifying a larger number 
of null characters (control_@) required after the screen clear function.
Most terminals 
require about 40 milliseconds to clear the screen and the number
of null characters  required to 
fill out that amount of time will depend on the speed at which you 
are running your terminal. For example, you should be able to use 
about 40 nulls when 
the terminal is running at 9600 baud. Null characters are used 
because they are not displayed and have no effect over the display
so are ideal to "kill" time in the computer.

{m:1
After a brief pause, during which the program loads the song
into memory, the screen will again clear and display
the first page of the song along with the Edit_mode Menu. The menu 
will be discussed in the reference section below. Suffice it here to 
say that the menu reminds you of what mode you are using and what the 
choices of inputs are available to you. You can compare what you see 
on the screen with the illustration in the section MUSIC NOTATION 
SYSTEM. You will note that the first line of the display is missing 
from the illustration. This, of course is the "da capo" terminal 
line.

{m:2
If the display on your screen is not arranged in columns and 
does not look like the illustration in the MUSIC NOTATION SYSTEM 
section,  then there is
probably an error in the information you gave SETUP about the way in 
which your terminal implements the cursor address function.
You must rerun SETUP,
giving the correct information about the cursor address function of your
terminal. Since the methods used by various terminals for cursor 
addressing are usually complicated, you may wish to go back to the 
manual for your terminal to get a good understanding of how the 
function is performed before you rerun SETUP.

{m:1
This comment is to apply over the entire tutorial. You will 
occasionally strike a key which either you did not intend or EDIT 
will not allow. If this happens, EDIT will display an error message 
at the top of the screen and will ring the bell if you have one. 
Don't panic. The message will tell you to press the space key to 
continue. That is exactly what you should do. EDIT will return the 
cursor where it was at the moment you struck the key in error and no 
harm will be done. Just continue as if nothing happened.

It is also possible that you may strike a key which you did not 
intend but that EDIT WILL ALLOW. A special key is provided to allow 
you to quit EDIT without updating the song stored on the diskette.
This will cover any errors you make, so relax. 


IV.B.3.a. Navigation

The first exercises are to navigate within the song. That is,
to move the cursor around within the song.

You use
the cursor to inform EDIT of the locality of the song in which
you wish to operate. It is very important that you understand the 
importance of the cursor. It is your primary way of informing the 
computer of the meaning of your entries. In other words, if the 
cursor is in a voice field and you enter a period...which only has 
meaning when used to adjust the duration...EDIT will consider your 
entry as an error. This is because EDIT expects input consistent with 
the area (the voice field in this instance) designated by the cursor.

The cursor can be moved around through the use of several different 
keys. Which key you use to navigate will depend on the 
distance the cursor must move to reach its destination. What we will 
now do is to introduce you to each of the navigational aids so that 
you can make intelligent choices later.


IV.B.3.a.i. The Home Function

This function moves the cursor from one end of the song to the other.
If you have a home_key, press it. If you do not, press
control_Y. The screen should clear and display the
end of the song. You should notice the last line. It should be the 
terminal line "da end."

{m:2
If this does not happen, you must rerun SETUP, giving it
the correct answer for the home_key assignment for your
terminal and/or the correct information describing the
cursor addressing function for your terminal.

{m:1
Now press the home_key again. The screen should look as
it did before you pressed the home_key the first time. The home 
function is designed to move the cursor to opposite ends of the song 
on alternate uses of it. This way, only one key need be assigned to 
the function.


IV.B.3.a.ii. The Direction Function

Note the arrow in the upper left_hand corner of your screen.
This character tells the direction to be taken by the home
function. Press the home_key several times and observe what
happens to the direction arrow. You can control the direction
manually
by pressing the direction keys on your keyboard (the
direction keys are the ones labeled with "<" and ">"). Try this
and observe the change. The "<" represents the up direction
while the ">" represents the down direction.


IV.B.3.a.iii. The Page Function

The letter "P" has a special use in EDIT. Press the home_key
once or twice until the "da capo" line appears to tell you that you 
are at the top of the song. Then press the letter "P" once. The screen
should display the page following the first page.

By pressing the letter "P", you can "page" through your song at
the rate of 23 lines per page. Try doing this with the
direction arrow pointing both ways. The direction arrow
affects the direction of the page function just as
it affects the direction of the home function. Notice that when 
the cursor reaches the top or bottom of the song, the direction arrow 
reverses and the page function also reverses. Again, only one key 
need be assigned to the page function as a consequence.


IV.B.3.a.iv. The Cursor Functions

While both the home function and the page function affect the 
movement of the cursor, they are long range operations. Obviously, 
you need some more delicate operations if you are to get to any point 
in the song. We will now discuss the short range cursor functions.

If your keyboard has special keys with arrows each
pointing in the four directions up, down, left and right,
then you are ready
to navigate. If your CRT does not have these keys, then use
control_K for up, control_J for down, control_H for left and
control_L for right. Also, as an added convenience, you may use 
the return key (sometimes labeled "enter") or the line_feed key 
for the down function.

Use these four keys and observe the movement of the cursor.
It should go down one song line when you press the down_key,
up one song line when you press the up_key, left one column
when you press the left_key, and right one column when you
press the right_key. Note especially that the cursor moves
from the first character of each column to the first character
of the next column as you press the left_key or right_key.
Also note that both keys "wrap around" and you can get to
the same column by using either key and going in either
direction.

Normally, the direction arrow is unaffected by the use of the four 
cursor keys. However, if you move the cursor up to the top of the 
song with the up_key, the direction arrow will change and the up_key 
will become ineffective. The same applies to the down_key at the 
bottom of the song. You can try these special situations and observe 
the effects.

Place the first page of the song on the screen. (You should now know 
how to do this with ease.) Press the down_key a number of times
until the cursor reaches
the bottom of the screen. Continue pressing the down_key. Note that the
song scrolls up. This scrolling process can continue until the 
bottom of the song is reached whereupon the down_key becomes 
inoperative as we discussed earlier.

Place the bottom of the song on the screen. Then press the up_key
until the cursor reaches the top of the screen.
Press it once more. Note that the screen is replaced with the
cursor on the center line of the screen.


IV.B.3.a.v. The Space Function

The space_key is used to move around within a particular column
whether it be a duration or voice column. Try the space_key
and observe how it "wraps around" within whatever voice or
duration the cursor happens to be in at the time. Try it in
various columns. 

Incidentally, you may notice that the left_key has a strange
effect whenever the cursor is NOT at the first character of a
column. It backs up only one character until it reaches the
first character of the column whereupon it begins jumping whole
columns. Try this by pressing first the space_key then the
left_key.

Choose some particular point in the song presently displayed and 
attempt to use a combination of cursor functions to place the 
cursor at your chosen point. Choose several other points and repeat 
the process. Try to get to the accidental at song line 37, voice 2.
How about the octave number at song line 
5, voice 1? Just practice awhile until you are confident you can move 
the cursor to any place in the song. Notice that you can 
place the cursor even on option lines. When you need to excise a 
measure line you inadvertantly entered, you will see why you can do 
this.


IV.B.3.a.vi. Modes of Edit

EDIT operates in four modes. Each mode is distinguished by a 
menu line at the top of the screen whenever EDIT is in that mode.
EDIT always begins in Edit_mode. To get to any other mode, you must 
be in Edit_mode, consequently, you can look upon Edit_mode as "home base." The 
other three modes are Insert_mode, Excise_mode and Option_mode. We 
will discuss all but Option_mode in the tutorial.


IV.B.3.a.vi.1. Edit Mode

Now that you can place the cursor anywhere within the song,
let's try making changes to the notes in the song.
Place the cursor at either of the two voice columns.

In the following, be sure that you do NOT press the I, O, M or
X keys. These are keys which cause EDIT to operate in modes
different from the basic Edit_mode.
Each mode will be covered in turn. If you hit one of these keys
and the menu at the top of the screen no longer has the word EDIT
in it, then press control_Q one time before attempting to continue.
This should return you to the Edit mode which you can recognize
by the word EDIT in the menu at the top of the screen.

Now type a valid note name. Remember, they are A, B, C, D, E, F,
G and R. Notice that the cursor does not move to the accidental
position but moves instead to the octave position. This
characteristic, coupled with the flat and sharp tables (we'll
discuss these later), will greatly simplify your work in entering
music. Also, you may note that the accidental is set to a natural
(or @ symbol.) That's because the key signature is set to C major
when EDIT is begun. You can change the accidental by first pressing
the left_key to back up to the accidental position and then typing
the appropriate accidental. Try different accidentals. Note that
you can use the numbers 1, 2 and 3 to 
obtain flat, natural and sharp respectively.

Try pressing a key which is not an accidental while the cursor is
in the accidental position. An error message will appear at the top 
of the screen and, if your terminal has a bell, the bell will
ring. To show that you recognize the error, type a space.
You can continue by experimenting with changing note names,
accidentals and octaves. If you need to, refresh your memory by
re-reading the section about Voices in the MUSIC NOTATION SYSTEM 
section of the manual.

After you have become comfortable with changing voice information,
move the cursor over to the duration column and try the same
experiments with duration information. If you need to refresh
your memory about the duration codes, reread the section in this
manual on Duration. Try some dotted and doubly-dotted durations. 
change a dotted or doubly-dotted duration back to a non-adjusted 
duration. Note that the adjustment disappears automatically whenever 
the duration is replaced.


IV.B.3.a.vi.2. Insert Mode

You cannot use the Edit_mode
when you first begin entering a song or when
you need to add new lines
to an already existing song. This is because Edit_mode operates only
on song lines which already exist. Adding new song lines is done
only when you place EDIT in the Insert_mode. You do this by
typing the letter "I" when you are in the Edit_mode. Place the cursor at
a voice column of any song line and type an I. You will note that
the Insert_mode menu appears at the top of the screen.

For practice, enter the note A@4 by typing first the letter "A", then 
the number 4. Press return. See how the note
information
is carried down to the new song line. Type the letter "B". Again press
return. Continue entering the scale in the fourth octave.
Observe that you need to type only the note name and the return
as long as you remain in the same octave and do not have any
accidentals. Now return to the Edit_mode by typing a control_Q.

Note that the new song lines precede the song line which was
under the cursor when you first entered the Insert_mode. All 
insertions occur between the line
marked by the cursor and the line above. So make sure that you place 
the cursor at the proper place when preparing to add new song lines.

Move the cursor up to the second voice column at the first song
line which you inserted earlier. Again press the letter "I". You
are back in
Insert_mode for the next voice. Proceed as you did for the
first voice. That is, key in some notes.  Attempt to insert
additional song lines beyond
the lines you previously entered. You will get a message
informing you that you must quit Insert_mode. Press space.
EDIT will return to Edit_mode.

Complete the duration column
for the insertion using Insert_mode. Note that you cannot
use the up_key while in Insert_mode. You
must always return to the Edit_mode to begin at the top of
another column.


IV.B.3.a.vi.3. Excise Mode

Enter Excise_mode from Edit_mode by typing the letter "X". 
Observe that the cursor is moved to the extreme left of
the current song line. Press the up_key. The line above should
disappear. Press
the up_key again. The same thing happens to the next line above.
Now press the down_key. The line last excised reappears. Press
the down_key twice more. The first line reappears and the line
where the cursor was originally now disappears. You excise
a line by causing it to disappear while in Excise_mode
and then pressing the control_Q key to return to Edit_mode.
Excise a few lines, return to Edit_mode and note how those
lines have been removed from the song.

This is the end of the tutorial section. Because you have made 
audacious changes to J. S. Bach's Invention #1, you must return to the 
operating system without updating the song as it is stored on the 
diskette. Press control_C to cancel the edit session.
