IV.B.4. Reference

The following section describes the characteristics of EDIT
by simple enumeration.


IV.B.4.a. Quit

EDIT is terminated and the song is stored back to the floppy
disk when you press the quit-key (normally set as control-Q) while
in Edit_mode. As the song is written to floppy disk, all
M_option lines are renumbered sequentially. The song file created
by EDIT has a type of .SNG and the type of the song file that was
used as
input is changed from .SNG to .SBK for use as a backup if needed.
Any prior backup is deleted.

EDIT is terminated and control is returned to the operating system
without updating the song on the diskette when you press the 
cancel_key (normally set as control_C) while in Edit_mode.

The quit_key is used to quit Insert_mode and Excise_mode to
return control to Edit_mode.

Both the quit_key and the cancel_key can be reprogrammed through the 
use of SETUP. See Appendix A.


IV.B.4.b. Modes of Edit

EDIT operates in four modes. Each mode is distinguished by
a menu line at the top of the CRT screen whenever EDIT is in that
mode.

{m:2
{i:-8
1.
Edit_mode permits changing existing musical information
and is the mode in which the program begins when invoked.
You can get to the other three modes of operation only
when in Edit_mode.
{i:-8
2.
Insert_mode allows entry of new musical information.
{i:-8
3.
Excise_mode allows deletion of song and option lines.
{i:-8
4.
Option_mode presents a menu of musical functions and
edit services.

{m:1
Navigation from one mode to another is according to the graph shown 
on the next page. Note that Edit_mode is the pivotal point in the
structure. To 
get from one mode to another, you must return to 
Edit_mode. In the cases of Insert_mode and Excise_mode, you must use 
the quit_key. In the case of Options_mode, it is automatic at the 
completion of the specific function used.

IV.B.4.b.i. Edit_mode


IV.B.4.b.i.1. Menu(appears at the top of screen)

dEDIT: text, cursors, I(nsert, X(cise, O(ptions, M(easure, quit


IV.B.4.b.i.2. d(irection

The first character on the menu line is the direction indicator.
It may have two values. The down direction is indicated by the
character ">" while the up direction is indicated by the character
"<". The direction indicator affects two navigational aids, the
home function and the page function. You can change the direction
indicator at any time while in Edit_mode by pressing the <_key
or >_key.


IV.B.4.b.i.3. text

Edit_mode permits you to enter duration and note information
into existing song lines when the cursor is in the appropriate
columns. In other words, EDIT will accept duration data when the cursor
is in the duration column and it will accept note data when
the cursor is in the voice columns. EDIT will interpret the
characters according to the column under the cursor. For example,
your entering the letter "E" means different things depending on
which column is under the cursor. In the duration column, "E" means
"eighth note", while in a voice column it means the note "E". If the
cursor is not in the first position of a column, "E" is an error since
EDIT does not expect an "E" in that case. In that event, EDIT
will ring the CRT bell (if present) and display an error message.
A complete list of possible entries are described above in the 
section MUSIC NOTATION SYSTEM.


IV.B.4.b.i.4. cursors

The principal method of navigation available to you while editing is
through the use of the cursor control functions. The cursor can be
moved up, down, left
and right by using the cursor control functions. Further, you can page
through the
song as well as go directly to either the top or bottom of the song
with a single key stroke. Additional navigational aids are available
under the Option_mode.

{m:3
{i:-14
Cursor^up:
control_K, often labeled on keyboards as an up_arrow.
{i:-14
Cursor^down:
control_J, often labeled as a down_arrow.
{i:-14
Cursor^left:
control_H, often labeled as a left_arrow.
{i:-14
Cursor^right:
control_L, often labeled as a right_arrow.
{i:-14
Home^cursor:
control_Y, often labeled as HOME.
{i:-14
Page^cursor:
the letter "P".
{i:-14
Space:
the space bar.

{m:1
CRT terminals are not standard in their treatment of these characters.
Yours may not even have the symbols engraved on any of your keytops.
Since you may have to depress the control key every time a cursor movement
is desired (which is very frequently) you may wish to reassign the
keys which perform these functions.
Any of the functions except the Page function and the Space function can 
be reassigned using SETUP. See Appendix A.

Two auxiliary cursor controls are the direction control characters.

{m:3
{i:-14
up^direction: the character "<" (hexidecimal 3C).
{i:-14
down^direction: the character ">" (hexidecimal 3E).

{m:1
Using one of these two characters will determine the direction taken 
by the home and
page functions when they, in turn, are used.


IV.B.4.b.i.5. I(nsert

Pressing the letter "I" places EDIT in Insert_mode. See the section
Insert_Mode below for a complete description.


IV.B.4.b.i.6. X(cise

Pressing the letter "X" places EDIT in Excise_mode. See the section
Excise_mode below for a complete description.


IV.B.4.b.i.7. O(ptions

Pressing the letter "O" places EDIT in Option mode. See the section
Options_mode below for a complete description.


IV.B.4.b.i.8. M(easure

Pressing the letter "M" inserts a numbered measure option line into
the song
immediately preceding the line marked by the cursor; unless the
cursor is on the "da capo" line in which case the measure option
line is inserted immediately following. Measures may be numbered in any
order since EDIT always renumbers measures when the song is written
to the floppy disk. See the discussion of the measure option line in 
the section OPTION LINE DESCRIPTIONS.


IV.B.4.b.i.9. quit

See paragraph IV.B.4.a. above.


IV.B.4.b.ii. Insert_mode


IV.B.4.b.ii.1. Menu (appears at the top of the screen)

dINSERT: text, cursors, M(easure, quit


IV.B.4.b.ii.2. d(irection

See paragraph IV.B.4.b.i.2. above.


IV.B.4.b.ii.3. text

Insert_mode permits you to enter duration and note information into 
new song lines or existing song lines when the column at the cursor 
is empty. EDIT applies the same rules as are described in paragraph 
IV.B.4.b.i.3. above.


IV.B.4.b.ii.4. cursors

Insert_mode permits a subset of the cursor functions supported by 
Edit_mode:

{m:2
{i:-8
1.
Cursor down
{i:-8
2.
Cursor left
{i:-8
3.
Cursor right
{i:-8
4.
Space bar


{m:1
IV.B.4.b.ii.5. M(easure

See paragraph IV.B.4.b.i.8. above.


IV.B.4.b.ii.6. quit

See paragraph IV.B.4.a. above.


IV.B.4.b.ii.7. Discussion

Insert_mode operates in one of two ways depending upon the
location of the cursor at the time of entry into the mode.

If the cursor is on an option line or a voice (or duration)
column which contains data, then Insert_mode
will insert song lines in front of the line.

If the
cursor is on an empty voice or duration column, then
Insert_mode will not insert song lines but will allow you
to fill in the empty column until a non_empty entry is
encountered or the "da end" terminal line is encountered,
whichever occurs first.

The most efficient way to use EDIT to enter a new
song is described in the following steps:

{m:2
{i:-8
1.
Type EDIT songname followed by a return.
{i:-8
2.
Enter the number of voices.
{i:-8
3.
Press the letter "O" to enter Option mode.
{i:-8
4.
Press "!" or "#" to set the key signature
and enter the notes to be sharped or flatted.
See paragraphs IV.B.4.b.iv.10 and IV.B.4.b.iv.11.
{i:-8
5.
Place the cursor at the point in the song above
which you would like to insert new song lines. If
it is a new song, this point would be the "da end"
line.
{i:-8
6.
Press the letter "I" to enter Insert mode.
{i:-8
7.
Enter the note information for one field in one
voice or duration
column. (Start with the first voice column which is
the second column on the screen.)
{i:-8
8.
press the down_key.
{i:-8
9.
Repeat steps 7 and 8 until the entire column
has been entered. Use the "M" key as needed to 
insert measures into the song.
{i:-8
10.
Press the control_Q key to return control to the
Edit mode.
{i:-8
11.
Press the letter "O" to enter Option mode.
{i:-8
12.
Press the letter "V" to locate the first empty portion
of the song. See paragraph IV.B.4.b.iv.7.
{i:-8
13.
Repeat steps 6 through 12 until all voice and the
duration columns have been completed.
{i:-8
14.
Press the control_Q key to quit EDIT and store the
song on the diskette.

{m:1
This procedure uses both facilities of Insert_mode, the first
when you insert the first voice, the second when you insert the
other voices and the duration.


IV.B.4.b.iii. Excise_mode


IV.B.4.b.iii.1. Menu (appears at the top of the screen)

dEXCISE: up, down or quit


IV.B.4.b.iii.2. d(irection

See paragraph IV.B.4.b.i.2. above.


IV.B.4.b.iii.3. up, down

Excise_mode permits you to remove unwanted lines using the up_key
and/or the down_key. Lines removed with the use of one of the
two keys can be returned to the song with the use of the other key.


IV.B.4.b.iii.4. quit

You accept the excision by pressing the quit key to return to
Edit_mode.


IV.B.4.b.iv. Option_mode


IV.B.4.b.iv.1. Menu

Options_mode is operated completely by menu selection. Upon entering 
Options_mode, EDIT clears the screen and displays the menu. You may 
select any function by pressing the key corresponding to the function 
in the menu. The menu appears as follows:

{m:2
{i:-2
type a...
{l:C   to call a chorus (or refrain)
{l:F   to find a label, line or measure
{l:L   to label the current song line
{l:M   to set the number of intervals per octave
{l:R   to mark a repeat
{l:T   to change the tempo
{l:V   to verify completeness
{l:W   to change waveforms
{l:X   to end a chorus
{l:!   to change the flatted notes
{l:#   to change the sharped notes
{l:...>

{m:1
Pressing any key not in the list will return control to
Edit_mode.  After the processing associated with the selected 
function is complete, control is returned automatically to Edit_mode.


IV.B.4.b.iv.2. To Call a Chorus

Type the letter "C". EDIT then requests the name of the
chorus label. Enter the label name identifying the beginning of the
desired chorus. Follow with a carriage return. The label name
must be exactly as it appears in the label. See paragraphs 
IV.B.4.b.iv.4., V.A. and V.C. for additional information.
This function places a Chorus Call option line in the song.


IV.B.4.b.iv.3. Find a Label, Line or Measure

Type the letter "F" to invoke the function. A new menu appears.

{m:2
{i:-2
Type a...
{l:L  to find a label
{l:M  to find a measure
{l:S  to find a song line
{l:...>
          
{m:1
To find a label, type the letter "L". Then enter the label name matching
the label to be found. Follow with carriage return. EDIT will
attempt to locate the label, and, if found, will place the
cursor on the label line. If the label is not found, EDIT will
leave the cursor where it was before the function was requested.

To find a measure, type the letter "M". Then enter the measure number
matching the measure to be found. Follow with carriage
return. EDIT will attempt to locate the measure, and, if
found, will place the cursor on the measure line. If the
measure is not found, EDIT will leave the cursor where it
was before the function was requested.

To find a song line, type the letter "S". Then enter the line number
matching the song line to be found. Follow with carriage
return. EDIT will attempt to locate the measure, and, if
found, will place the cursor on the song line. If the
song line is not found, EDIT will leave the cursor where it
was before the function was requested.


IV.B.4.b.iv.4. To Label the Current Song Line

Type the letter "L" . Then enter from one to
eight characters as the label name. You may use any characters
from the set of possibilities below. Follow the label name
with a carriage return. This function places a Label option line in 
the song.

{m:2
{i:-8
1.
The numbers
{i:-8
2.
The upper case alphabet
{i:-8
3.
The special characters

{m:1
EDIT will ask for a label key. This is to allow you to identify
the label for use in the interactive performance mode of PLAY.
Read the section describing PLAY for more information about
this function. If you wish to use this feature, type any unique
key from the following set of possibilities.

{m:2
{i:-8
1.
The numbers
{i:-8
2.
The upper case alphabet
{i:-8
3.
The lower case alphabet
{i:-8
4.
The special characters
{a:p=1
{m:1
IV.B.4.b.iv.5. To Set or Change the Number of Intervals per Octave

Type the letter "M".
Then enter the number of intervals
in the octave. Follow with carriage return. Musicraft
supports from one to 99 intervals per octave while at the same
time supporting the chromatic octave. You may use either of
the two notations to represent note information at any time. Note
that EDIT does not check to see that the numbers you give for note
information are less than or equal to the number of intervals you
established to be in the octave; COMP does, however, and will
report errors. This function places a Microtone option line in the 
song.


IV.B.4.b.iv.6. To mark a Repeat

Type the letter "R".
Then enter the label name of the
label marking the beginning of the repeat segment. This label
name is not checked for correctness by EDIT, but it is checked
by COMP. This function places a Repeat option line in the song.


IV.B.4.b.iv.7. To set or change the Tempo

Type the letter "T".  Then enter the number of quarter
notes per minute at which to perform the song segment to follow.
Type a return. The tempo may range from 1 to 999 quarter notes per
minute. This function places a Tempo option line in the song.


IV.B.4.b.iv.8. To Verify Completeness

Type the letter "V". EDIT will scan the song in memory
and verify that all entries are filled. If an empty spot is found
(except for duration adjust), that portion of the song will be
displayed and the cursor placed at the incomplete point. If the
song is complete, the top of the song will be displayed and the
cursor placed at the first line. A song should be checked using
this function before compiling it the song.


IV.B.4.b.iv.9. To Change Waveforms

Type the letter "W". Then enter the waveform table
number to be related to the voice identified by the prompt. 
Follow the number with a return. The
number must be in the range 1 to 14 inclusive. EDIT will repeat its
request for each voice in the song. You must enter an acceptable
table number for each request. This function places a Waveform option 
line in the song.
 

IV.B.4.b.iv.10. To End a chorus

Type the letter "X". EDIT will insert a Chorus Exit option
line immediately above the line under the cursor when the
option mode was entered.


IV.B.4.b.iv.11. To Change the Flatted Notes

Type a "!" or a 1. EDIT clears any flat
signature and requests entry of the notes to be flatted. Enter
the note names in any order and terminate the sequence with
carriage return. If you enter an unintended note name, press
return immediately and re-do the function. All note names
from A to G are accepted. The flat signature is remembered by EDIT 
only for the duration of the edit session. When you want to edit a 
song which has a key signature, you must reset the signature.


IV.B.4.b.iv.12. To Change the Sharped Notes

Type a "#" or a 2. EDIT clears any sharp signature and requests entry 
of the notes to be sharped. Enter the note names in any order and 
terminate the sequence with a carriage reture. If you enter an 
unintended note name, press return immediately and re-do the 
function. All note names from A to G are accepted. The sharp 
signature is remembered by EDIT only for the duration of the edit 
session. When you want to edit a song which has a key signature, you 
must reset the signature.

EDIT will carry both a flat key signature and a sharp key signature 
simultaneously. This can be helpful, especially for the minor keys.
