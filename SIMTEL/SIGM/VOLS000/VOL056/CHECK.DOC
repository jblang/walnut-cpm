II. INITIAL CHECKOUT

For successful checkout and operation of the Musicraft diskette
provided, you must perform two initial steps.

{m:2
{i:-8
1.
Copy the diskette to a work diskette immediately upon
receiving it and before attempting to operate any program.
Save the original diskette as your back_up. Never use
the back_up diskette for any purpose other than to recreate
a work diskette for your own use.

{i:-8
2.
Place a copy of your operating system onto tracks zero
and one of your working diskette using the means provided
by your operating system.

{m:1
The Musicraft system diskette contains the programs as well as
several songs and a waveform file. You can find them by placing
the work diskette in your A:drive and using the following
command.

{m:4
{i:-40
A>^^XDIR^(press^return)
This displays the contents of the directory on the diskette.


{m:1
{l:The directory should appear as follows:

{l:     XDIR    COM             SETUP   COM             EDIT    COM
{l:     COMP    COM             WAVE    COM             PLAY    COM
{l:     PRINT   COM             S801    CNF             S802    CNF
{l:     S853    CNF             S855    CNF             Z801    CNF
{l:     Z802    CNF             Z804    CNF             INVENT1 SNG
{l:     INVENT4 SNG             INVENT8 SNG             WAVE    WAV
        
The first program, XDIR, is a program in the public domain and is not
part of the Musicraft system. XDIR provides an improved, informative
listing of the directory. The remaining files are the programs of
Musicraft as well as sample configurations, song files and a waveform
file. The songs and the waveform are intended for your use in
familiarizing yourself with the basic operation of Musicraft. 

Musicraft uses the file type to distinguish among the files involved in 
making music, and you will find a 
complete explanation of the file type conventions in 
Appendix C.

You can immediately perform a song if you have inserted your music board
into the backplane at the i/o address hard wired on the music board.
(Please see the instructions accompanying the music board for correct
installation and hardware testing. If you have modified the i/o address
installed on the board, you will need to run SETUP. SETUP is self
documenting, but to assist you in being prepared to deal with  the
questions asked by SETUP, use the worksheet provided in Appendix A.) 

You will note several .CNF type files on the directory of your work
diskette. These are configuration files describing computers with
various clock
speeds. Their names and meaning are according to the following table.

{m:2
{l:     Name            Meaning
        
{l:     C1.CNF          Microprocessor running at 1 Mhz
{l:     C2.CNF          Microprocessor running at 2 Mhz
{l:     C25.CNF         Microprocessor running at 2.5 Mhz
{l:     C3.CNF          Microprocessor running at 3 Mhz
{l:     C4.CNF          Microprocessor running at 4 Mhz
{l:     C5.CNF          Microprocessor running at 5 Mhz
{l:     C6.CNF          Microprocessor running at 6 Mhz

{m:1
Find the file whose description best fits your own system and
change its name to SONG.CNF by typing the following. (C2.CNF is
used here as an example)

{m:4
{i:-40
A>^^REN^SONG.CNF=C2.CNF^(press^return)
This
file will be used by COMP program to generate a song
in playable form in the
next steps.

{m:1
This should give reasonably satisfactory results for now. However,
if the configuration file you initially chose does not seem right,
you can come
back to this step later and change to a different configuration file.
But, if it is near the correct pitch and tempo, don't worry about
it for now.

There are several song files on your diskette. These songs have
been entered but have not yet been compiled. Let's see what steps
are necessary to play the song called INVENT1. Perform the
following dialog with your computer.

{m:4
{i:-40
A>^^COMP^INVENT1^(press^return)
You have asked
the compile program to convert the
song INVENT1 into playable form. The
lines displayed from this point to
the next occurence of the A> symbol
are intended to keep you informed
of the progress of COMP and require
no response on your part.

{m:1
{l:(additional lines from COMP)

{m:4
{i:-40
A>^^PLAY^INVENT1^(press^return)
You have asked
the play program to load the song
INVENT1 into its memory. After PLAY
has done this, it will ask you to
name a waveform with which to play
the first voice.

{m:1
{l:Please enter wave name for table 1  >

{m:4
{i:-40
^^^^WAVE^(press^return)
You have asked the
player program to use the waveform
table provided on the diskette. PLAY
will sketch the shape of the waveform
as it loads it.

{m:1
At this point, if you have properly installed the music board and
have performed the above steps correctly, you should be listening to
J S Bach's Invention #1.

You can now repeat this procedure for the other files having a file
type of .SNG by replacing the name INVENT1 with the name of another
song in the above dialog.

Generally, in order for you to enter a song, compile it,
and, finally to play
it will require that you perform the following steps:

{m:4
{i:-40
A>^^EDIT^songname^(press^return)
You have asked the
edit program to find a song file
on the diskette under the name you
gave it, load the song into memory
if it is found, and then permit you
to make changes, additions or deletions
to the song. Then, upon your signal 
that it is time to quit, EDIT
will write the updated
version back to the diskette.

{i:-40
A>^^COMP^songname^(press^return)
You have asked
COMP to convert your
song into playable form. You wait
until it is done.

{i:-40
A>^^PLAY^songname^(press^return)
You have asked
PLAY to perform your
song.
{a:p=1
{m:1
You have many options in each of these programs that permit you
to control the music which is ultimately performed, but the three
steps above are the backbone of your operations for every song you
will ever play using Musicraft.
  
The three additional programs are called from the command mode of
your operating system in an equally simple manner.

{m:4
{i:-40
A>^^WAVE^(press^return)
You have asked the
waveform generator program to accept
your request for the construction
of one or more waveform tables to
be stored on diskette for later use.

{i:-40
A>^^SETUP^(press^return)
You have begun the
process of defining the configuration
of your computer system to Musicraft.
DO NOT attempt to run SETUP for now
unless you had to have done so due to
hardware changes to the music board
as described earlier.

{i:-40
A>^^PRINT^songname^(press^return)
You have asked the
song print program to give you a
hard copy of the song you have selected.


{m:1
The above discussion is intended only to show you the rudiments of 
using the Musicraft System. The actual details describing how you
interact with each of the programs is described under
the heading PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS.
{a:p=1
III. MUSIC NOTATION SYSTEM


III.A. Song File

Songs are maintained by Musicraft in files stored on diskettes. Each
file is comprised of a set of records, or lines, each describing some
musical aspect of the song.  Each line is one of two possible types.

{m:2
{i:-8
1.
A song line containing pitch and duration information
for each voice to be performed, and
{i:-8
2.
An option line containing information affecting secondary
aspects of musical performance such as tempo, repetition
and so forth.

{m:1
Frequently, a group of song/option lines will be involved in the
discussion of some function in this manual. When a group of lines
are involved as a unit, the expression "song segment" or, more simply,
"segment" will be used to refer to them.


III.B. Song Line

Music is maintained as a series of song lines. Using EDIT, you can
add music to an existing song by inserting song lines, and delete
undesired music by removing song lines. A song line contains the
following information:

{m:2
{i:-8
1.
Line number.
{i:-8
2.
Duration of song line.
{i:-8
3.
Pitch for voice 1.
{i:-8
4.
Pitch for voice 2 (if specified).
{i:-8
5.
Pitch for voice 3 (if specified).
{i:-8
6.
Pitch for voice 4 (if specified).


{m:1
III.B.1. Line Number

EDIT provides an ability to find song lines by the line number.
COMP reports errors using the line number.


III.B.2. Duration

The duration field is used to tell PLAY how long to perform the
song line. It is one or two characters in length. The first character
must be one of the following:

{a:p=1
{m:2
{i:-8
Char
Meaning

{i:-8
W
Whole note
{i:-8
H
Half note
{i:-8
Q
Quarter note
{i:-8
E
Eighth note
{i:-8
S
Sixteenth note
{i:-8
T
Thirty-second note
{i:-8
X
Sixty-fourth note (See note below)

{m:1
{l:You may also use the following:

{l:A^Triplet half note^^^^^^^K^Triplet sixteenth note
{l:B^1/5th of a whole note^^^L^1/7th of a quarter note
{l:C^Triplet quarter note^^^^N^1/5th of an eighth note
{l:D^1/7th of a whole note^^^P^Triplet thirty-second note
{l:F^1/5th of a half note^^^^U^1/7th of an eighth note
{l:G^Triplet eighth note^^^^^V^1/5th of a sixteenth note
{l:I^1/7th of a half note^^^^Y^triplet sixty-fourth note
{l:^^(see note below)
{l:J^1/5th of a quarter note

(Note: I and X can be entered when in EDIT only when in the
Insert-mode since these characters are used to enter the
Insert_mode and the Excise_mode. See the section of the manual
describing EDIT for clarification of these terms.)

The second character used in the duration field is the duration
adjustment and may be one of the following:

A period (".") adjusts the duration in the same manner as does dotting a
note in musical notation.
     
A colon (":") adjusts the duration in the same manner as does
doubly-dotting a note in musical notation.



III.B.3. Voice

Each voice field is composed of three parts describing the pitch
or rest to be performed. The voice field contains the following
three parts:

{m:2
{i:-8
Part
Meaning

{i:-8
1.
The note name. Any letter from the following is acceptable:
A, B, C, D, E, F, G or R. The first seven are the note names
for the standard scale while the letter R signifies that a
rest is desired (ie., the voice is to be silent).

{i:-8
2.
The accidental. Any one of the following:
! (or 1) represents a flat.
@ (or " or 2) represents a natural.
# (or 3) represents a sharp.

{i:-8
3.
The octave. Any number from 1 to 7. The lowest octave is
designated as 1 (Low A, the bottom note on most pianos,
is the bottom note in the Musicraft scale as well),
Middle C is in the 4th octave, and the top octave is
designated as the 7th octave.

{m:1
{l:Examples of correct voice data are:

{m:3
{i:-8
A@1
Bottom note in Musicraft scale
{i:-8
A@5
Concert A (at 440 Hertz)
{i:-8
C@4
Middle C
{i:-8
C@6
High C
{i:-8
F#5
F sharp below High C
{i:-8
G#7
Top note in Musicraft scale

{m:1
The musical staff below shows the range of the system as well
as sample note data as written in the Musicraft notation.
{a:l=22
If we now put all the information together, on the next page
we can compare
measure one of J. S. Bach's Invention #1
in both standard notation and in the music notation used by
Musicraft. Notice that, while standard notation reflects time
horizontally across the page, Musicraft shows time vertically
down the CRT face. This is because the scrolling conventions
normally used with CRTs encourage the vertical direction.

{a:p=2
III.C. Microtones

Additionally, Musicraft supports microtonal music. When the
microtone option is used you may replace the note name and the 
accidental with a two-digit
number corresponding to the interval within the microtonal
octave. Suppose you want to divide the octave into 24
equally tempered intervals. Each "note" has a number, then,
which corresponds to its position in the octave starting with
the lowest note in the octave.  The numbers permissible in this
instance are 01 (which corresponds in pitch to A) through 24
(which corresponds in pitch to a note between G# and A one
octave above 01). The lowest note in the octave is designated
as 01 and the highest note as 24. In another
example, suppose the octave is divided into 12 intervals,
the normal chromatic scale. Now, the lowest note, 01,
is A@, while the highest note, 12, is G#.

Microtonal notation can be intermixed with the traditional
notation described above whenever a song has a microtone
assignment. For more information on this, see below in the
Options_mode section of the PROGRAM DESCRIPTION of EDIT as well
as the discussion of the Microtone Option Line in OPTION LINE
DESCRIPTIONS.

Incidentally, microtones are convenient for use in traditional
music whenever a glissando is needed.


III.D. Option Lines

There are many musical functions which cannot be performed
using only the song line technique described above. In order
to provide for such things as tempo settings and changes, repeats
and choruses (or refrains), Musicraft supports special lines of
information which you place at appropriate points in a song
as you edit the song. You do this by using the Options menu of
EDIT. See the Options_mode section of the PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
of EDIT for a detailed discussion of the Options menu.

An option line is distinguished from a song line by the fact
that it has an asterisk ("*") as its first character. The
second character determines the specific function. A list
of the possible option lines are:

{m:3
{i:-8
Char
Meaning
        
{i:-8
C
Call a chorus
{i:-8
L
Label a song line
{i:-8
M
Mark a measure
{i:-8
R
Mark the end of a repeat
{i:-8
T
Set or change the tempo
{i:-8
W
Set or change the waveforms
{i:-8
X
End a chorus


{m:1
A complete description of all option lines and the functions performed
by each is presented under the heading OPTION LINE DESCRIPTIONS.
{a:p=1
