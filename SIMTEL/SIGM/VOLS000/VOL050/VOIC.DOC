	   WRITTEN & RELEASED IN PUBLIC DOMAIN BY AL JEWER, 
	    SHAWN EVERSON,AND WILLIAM WHITFORD, 10/21/81



THIS DOC FILE EXPLAINS THE USE OF THE VOIC@ SOFTWARE
PACKAGE FOR USE WITH THE SWEET TALKER SPEECH BOARD AND A
Z80 CPU WITH PARALLEL PORT INTERFACE.
ANY OTHER BOARD USING THE SC-01 VOICE SYSTHESIS CHIP FROM
VOTRAX SHOULD BE ABLE TO BE SUPPORTED WITH A MINIMUM OF
PROGRAM MODIFICATIONS.

THIS CODE IS WRITTEN FOR USE WITH AN 8255 PARALLEL PORT
INTERFACE CHIP. THE ONLY HARDWARE DEPENDANT ROUTINE IS
IN VOIC@.LIB, WHICH PROVIDES SETUP FOR THE 8255 AT BASE 
ADDRESS 24H AND READS & WRITES TO ITS PORTS. ANY OTHER
PARALLEL PORT INTERFACE COULD BE USED BY RE-DEFINING
THE PORT ADDRESSES FOR YOUR PARTICULAR HARDWARE.

THE PROGRAMS INCLUDED IN THIS PACKAGE ARE:

		VMAC.ASM     -> THE MAC ASSEMBLER OVERLAY
		VRMAC.ASM    -> THE RMAC ASSEMBLER OVERLAY
		VOIC@.LIB    -> THE DRIVER FOR CP/M, PHONEME
				DEFINITIONS AND DICTONARY.
		VOIC@EQU.LIB -> SAME AS ABOVE MINUS DICTONARY
		TALK@.LIB    -> STARTING PLACE FOR WRITING NEW 
				VOICE PROGRAMS
		YESMASTR.VOC -> EXAMPLE PROGRAM WHICH HAS A 
				GOOD ATTITUDE.
		VOIC@.CRC    -> CRC'S OF ALL PROGRAMS
		VOIC@.DOC    -> THIS FILE


TO MAKE IT TALK:

1) CREATE A FILE OF TYPE .VOC (STARTING WITH TALK@.LIB) WHICH
	CONTAINS THE WORDS YOU WANT TO SAY, ONE PER LINE.
	UNIQUE WORDS CAN BE DEFINED AS PHONEMES. (SEE YESMASTR.VOC
	FOR DETAILS & EXAMPLE OF HOW TO DO THIS).

2) ASSEMBLE ABOVE FILE USING VMAC OR VRMAC TO CREATE A .HEX OR .REL
	FILE FOR USE BY THE LOADER (OR LINKER).

3) FOR VMAC: USE LOAD AS YOU WOULD WITH ANY .HEX FILE, TO CREATE A
	.COM FILE WHICH WILL TALK TO YOU.
   FOR VRMAC: USE LINK TO CREATE A .COM FILE, OR DECLARE A MODULE NAME
	AND LINK TO YOUR OTHER PROGRAMS!!!!

4) LISTEN TO IT!!!!



TO CREATE VMAC OR VRMAC:

READ VMAC OR VRMAC.ASM TEXT, AND FOLLOW DIRECTIONS THERE. YOU CANNOT
ASSEMBLE THESE FILES USING MAC OR RMAC, SINCE SOME OF THE WORDS 
DEFINED IN VOIC@.LIB ARE NORMALLY RESERVED WORDS IN MAC. WATCH OUT!
THE PSEUDO-OPS IN MAC HAVE BEEN CHANGED! CONSULT VMAC.ASM & VRMAC.ASM
FOR ALL PSEUDO-OP CHANGES. THANK YOU.
