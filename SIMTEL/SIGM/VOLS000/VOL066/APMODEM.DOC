		APMODEM VERSION 2.0 AND VERSION 1.0

     APMODEM is a modification of Ward Christensen's famous program 
MODEM which allows transfer of programs under the CP/M operating system.
This program has been so popular, that it has established the protocol for
CP/M file transfer via modem.
     Apple CP/M is a full 56k standard CP/M, but is limited in that the
disk format is unique to Apple.  This inhibits the exchange of software, which
is distressing since one of the main advantages of CP/M is the extensive 
amount of public domain software available.  With this modified version of
Ward's program, coupled with the many remote CP/M systems, all of this software
is now available to Apple users.
     This program should work with just about any modem set-up currently extant
on the Apple.  It has been tested with the D.C. Hayes Micromodem II, the CCS
7710A serial interface, and the Apple communications card.  It should also work
with the SSM serial board, but I have not tested it with this board or the
Apple serial interface.  Should you find that it doesn't work with these, 
please let me know, or even better, fix the program so that it works!
     The program is supplied as an ASM file, and will assemble without
modification to run with the Micromodem II.  Version 2.0 implements auto-
dialing feature of this modem, while version 1.0 does not.  To make the
COM file, simple type ASM APMODEM2 (of course, the assembler, ASM.COM must
be on the disk) and then LOAD APMODEM2.
     If you have another modem than the Micromodem, you must change the equate
for the Micromodem (found in the first few program lines after the opening 
comments) to FALSE and the equate for your modem to TRUE.  You must also change
the equate for INITREQ (initialization required) to TRUE.  The conditional
assembly will then take place properly for you modem.
     The modem program is very simple to use and self documenting if you type

	MODEM H    (for help).

     The program is controlled by the command line which also invokes the 
program.  To use simply type (from CP/M):
 
	MODEM (command string).

     The command string consists of a series of characters specifying the
function the modem is to carry out.  For example:

	MODEM TO    ==> sets the modem up as a terminal in the originate mode.

	MODEM S.110 PIP.COM ==>sends the file PIP.COM to another computer
					at 110 baud.
     The commands can be classed as primary and secondary commands.  The
primary command is represented by the first letter of the commands string.
Allowable primary commands are:

H	prints the help file...a list of the commands.

X	examples of how to use the modem program.

C	(Micromodem II only) automatically dial a number.  The program then
	  asks for the number, dials it, and if carrier is detected, drops
          into terminal mode.  If the carrier is not detected, it hangs up.

T	terminal mode.  Full duplex.

S	send a file to another computer.

R	receive a file from another computer.

E	act as a computer (echo all characters).

D	disconnect the phone (hang up) (Micromodem II only).

Allowable secondary options are:

A	answer mode.

O	originate mode.

D	hang up after execution of previous options.

T	go to terminal mode after previous options.

E	go to echo mode after previous options.

Q	quiet mode, no message displays.

R	show characters received.

S	show characters sent.

V	view the file sent/received, as it goes/comes.

     The baud rates may be switched on the Micromodem and Com card by
specifying .300 or .110 after the last of the secondary options in the 
command line.

Examples:

	MODEM ROVT FILE.COM ==> receive a file in originate mode, viewing
				  it as it comes in and save it in FILE.COM.
				  Drop into terminal mode when done.

	MODEM SAT.110 C:BYE.ASM ==> sent a file in answer mode, at 110 baud,
					dropping back into terminal mode when
					done.  Get the file from drive C:

	MODEM C  ==> dial a number to be asked for and connect with the
			computer at the other end.  (will drop into terminal
			mode with defaults set (originate, 300 baud)).

     The following control characters are active in terminal mode:

	ctrl-E ==> exit to CP/M, but don't hang up.
	ctrl-D ==> disconnect (hang up)	(Micromodem only).

     I will be happy to answer any questions.  Happy modeming!
