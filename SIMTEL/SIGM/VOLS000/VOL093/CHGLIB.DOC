                DOCUMENTATION FOR CHGLIB

Original 2/82 by Tony Ribeiro
Revised  2/83 by Bruce Ratoff for MODEM79x

     The  purpose  of  CHGLIB  is  to  make  insertions  and 
deletions  to the dial library of MODEM7 without  having  to  
reassemble the entire file.

     The  program uses and changes the COM file and does not 
touch or use the ASM file at all.

     NOTE:This  program  will function properly only if  the 
dial library is faithfully constructed as spelled out in the 
MODEM7 documentation.
          
     CHGLIB  operates by loading the present COM version  of 
MODEM7  into  ram,allows  you to make your  changes  to  the 
library,  and then saves the new COM file on disk.  It  does 
not delete your orig MODEM7 COM file. For example...       

          CHGLIB MODEM7.COM B:MODEM7A.COM

     Note   that   two(2)  arguments  must  be   used   when 
invoking  CHGLIB.  The first is the current file  name,  the 
second is the file name you assign to the new  version.   As 
for  the   second  argument  CHGLIB  will  not   accept  any 
file  name  that  is currently  active on that disk.  If you 
wish   to  keep   the same  file name,  you must delete  the 
old  version   and  then 'REN' the new version  after  using 
CHGLIB.

     The  first question the program asks you is if you know 
the  start address of the dial library in the  MODEM7  file.   
If  you  answer 'Y',  then the program prompts you for  that 
address.Enter the address in hex(4 chars are expected).   If  
you  answer 'N',you are asked if you wish the program to  do 
an AUTO SEARCH for the start address.  If you answer 'N'  to 
AUTO  SEARCH  the  prog will terminate and  reboot  to  your 
system.  If   answer   is 'Y' then CHGLIB will do  the  auto  
search  for  the  start  of  the  dial  library.NOTE--CHGLIB 
searches  only the first  2K   bytes  of the MODEM7 file  as 
this  is  where  the library is generally located.      When 
CHGLIB  beleives  that  it  has found the  library  it  will  
display   the   start  address and  the   library   on   the 
console.  It  will then ask you if the library  looks  ok(in 
other  words,has  CHGLIB  found the  correct  start).If  you 
answer no,then the program will continue the search.  If you 
answer  'Y',CHGLIB will keep track of the address and jmp to 
the  command  function.After  the  start  address  has  been 
established  you  will then get a  command  prompt.      The 
COMMANDS are as follows.               
          NOTE:   *  denotes a valid char A-Z
     1)^C      Exit to cpm.
     2)D*      Delete one phone nbr line
     3)I*      Insert one phone nbr line
     4)P       Prints dial library on list device
     5)R       Rereads source file(current changes are lost)
     6)V*      View one line 
     7)V?      View entire library
     8)W       Write new file to disk 

    NOTE:User can leave INSERT mode without changes if a  CR   
is  typed  with no characters entered on command  line.  For 
example,if user has started to type in chars and decides not  
to  make  any  changes,just  delete  chars typed in and  hit 
a  CR.If user enters 'I' but has not typed in any chars,then 
just  hit  a  CR.The  program will  return  to  the  command 
mode.Follow the the format shown on the INSERT mode  command 
line.You  must  enter  exactly 30  chars.Align  your   input   
with  the guide chars located above the cursor.  I have been 
using   this   program  for  awhile  and  find   it     very 
satisfactory.It makes changes to the library very fast.
                    TRY IT,YOU WILL LIKE IT
