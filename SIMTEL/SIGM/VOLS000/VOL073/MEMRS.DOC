Introduction
------------

     MEMRS   is  an  exhaustive  memory  test  program  for  CP/M 
environments.  It  tests from the top of itself to the bottom  of 
the CP/M BIOS or alternatively, the BDOS.

Usage
-----

     MEMRS  [-R][-B]

Where

     [-R]           is  an optional "Random  number  only"  test 
                    specifier

     [-B]           is an optional "Test to BDOS" specifier


Examples
--------

     MEMRS

          This will invoke the program with no special options.

     MEMRS -R

          This will invoke the program for the random number test 
          only.

     MEMRS -B

          This will invoke the program for default testing to the 
          bottom of the BDOS and use the BDOS for I/O rather than 
          default test to the bottom of the BIOS and use the BIOS 
          for I/O.

     MEMRS -BR  or  MEMRS -RB  or  MEMRS -B -R  or  MEMRS -R -B

          This will invoke the program for default testing to the 
          bottom  of  the  BDOS as above AND random  number  only 
          test.

Error Messages
--------------

     If  any memory location fails any of the component parts  of 
the memory test an error message will be displayed as follows:-

LOCATION  SHOULD BE           WAS
6000    00  0000 0000     FF  1111 1111     

     If there are multiple bad memory locations up to 18 will  be 
displayed  before the display halts and prompts for a keypress to 
display further errors.

"CR" to continue test - "SP", "^C" to quit, "^X" to restart.


Internal Prompts
----------------

     The program prompts for the starting and ending addresses of 
the block of memory to be tested and offers default values  which 
will  test the largest possible block of memory.  The default top 
of  the block to be tested depends on whether the -B  option  was 
specified.  If  the default values are chosen,  the actual  value 
determined  by the program is displayed next to the prompt as  if 
the user had entered the value.

     When specific values are entered by the user a valid 4 digit 
hexadecimal  address  must be given or an error message  will  be 
displayed and the prompt issued again.

     The program may be aborted at any time by hitting any of the 
keys specified in the abort prompt.

     The program prompts as follows:-

MEMRS Memory Test - Version 1.9

BDOS located at D300     Top of memory at FFFF    
Press "SP" or "^C" to warm boot at any time
or "^X" to restart test from beginning. 
Response of "CR" gives default test range
which starts above this program and ends at BDOS

Starting address (Hex or "CR") 08F7    
Ending address   (Hex or "CR") D3F9    
"CR" to continue test - "SP", "^C" to quit, "^X" to restart.


Tutorial on Memory Testing
--------------------------

     There  is no practical way to do a thorough test on all of a 
computers memory in one pass. The memory test program itself will 
occupy  some  memory  which it  cannot  thoroughly  test.  It  is 
possible  to write simple memory tests which are able to test the 
memory  that the reside in but these tests will not  detect  many 
types of memory errors.

     Memory  faults can be fairly simple gross errors where a bit 
is permanently stuck (high or low) or they may be  timing/pattern 
sensitive  where  the  fault  is  only  evident  with  a  certain 
combination  of  data  in surrounding bits.  To attempt  to  test 
memory as thoroughly as possible several different types of tests 
need to be performed.  MEMRS has a wide variety of tests and  has 
proven   particularly   effective  in  locating  bad  memory   in 
comparison  to  large number of other memory test  programs  with 
which  it has been compared.  It does not perform any  long  term 
memory retention testing or any "burn in" testing,  however these 
types  of tests are best performed over long periods of time  and 
require  highly  optimised programs to execute in realistic  time 
spans.

     MEMRS  is intended as a relatively fast but thorough test to 
quickly  establish whether any of the more common  memory  errors 
has  occured.   In  practical terms,  the whole of  a  computer's 
memory  rarely  fails simultaneously.  Memory failures  generally 
occur in individual memory chips which usually cover no more than 
16K of memory space (though this will change as 64K chips  become 
readily available).  In this case it is usually possible in  CP/M 
systems  to readdress memory so that the suspected bad memory  is 
located  in  an area that can be tested with MEMRS.  If  the  bad 
memory  is  located in any of the CP/M system areas it is  highly 
unlikely  that you will be able to reliably load any programs  at 
all from disk so there is not a great deal of point in  designing 
memory tests for these addresses.

     If  an error is suspected in the CP/M BIOS memory  area  the 
best  move  is to build a smaller size CP/M system that does  not 
use  the  suspected bad memory and the load MEMRS  and  test  the 
suspect  memory.  MEMRS will test any address explicitly given to 
it. It does not test to see if you will kill CP/M or itself.

     The  random  number  only test is  useful  for  longer  term 
testing of memory.  If an intermittent fault is suspected and the 
memory  has  passed  several "full" test cycles  it  is  probably 
worthwhile stopping the test and restarting it as a random number 
only test which will cycle much faster.

     The  normal default ending address of the bottom of the BIOS 
gives the largest possible block of memory to test. It also means 
that all console input and output from the program goes  directly 
to the BIOS jump table so it is not possible to log the output on 
the  printer  using  Control P.  Specifying the  BDOS  option  at 
invokation  directs all console output via the BDOS  which  means 
that  it  is  possible to log the test output on the  printer  by 
typing Control P before the program is invoked.
