Introduction
------------

     COMPARE is a binary file comparison utility program. It does 
a  byte  by byte comparison of two files and reports any  differ
ences.

Useage
------

     COMPARE [d:]filename1 [d:][filename2]

Where:
     d:             is an optional disk drive identifier
     filename1      is the first file name
     filename2      is an optional second file name

Examples
--------

     COMPARE ZAP.COM ZOT.COM

          This will compare ZAP.COM with ZOT.COM on the currently
          logged drive.

     COMPARE ZAP.COM B:

          This will compare ZAP.COM on the currently logged drive
          with ZAP.COM on drive B:.

     COMPARE B:ZAP.COM ZOT.COM

          This will compare ZAP.COM for drive B:  with ZOT.COM on 
          the currently logged drive.

     COMPARE B:ZAP.COM B:ZOT.COM

          This  will compare ZAP.COM with ZOT.COM both on the  B: 
          drive.

Error Messages
--------------

     The  program  will  give  an  error  message  if  it  cannot 
successfully open either of the specified files.  It will give an 
error message if the length of the files does not match.  It will 
report any bytes which do not match in the files.

++ FILES UNEQUAL IN SECTOR       1   AT BYTE  00

     Note  that  the sector number is equal to the  "DUMP  COUNT" 
displayed by DDH while dumping a file. This makes it easy to find 
the sector and byte for examination with DDH.    

Internal Prompts
----------------

     The prompt:

Do you want file 1 printed as it is compared?....Y/N (CR = N)

     This  is  only appropriate if you are comparing text  files. 
Replying  Y  for  a COM file will  generally  give  unpredictable 
display results and may lock out the terminal.

File Comparison Tutorial
------------------------

     This  program  does a BINARY file comparison and  is  really 
fairly dumb in the way it goes about it.  It is mostly useful for 
locating  small  differences  in  programs such  as  comparing  a 
reassembly of a disassembled program to the original COM file  or 
locating serial numbers, messages etc.

     If there are large differences between programs it is highly 
likely  that once one difference has been located,  all following 
bytes  will be different.  If you get more than one screenful  of 
consecutive mismatches it is probably worthwhile hitting  control 
C to abort the program.

     The program reads one sector from each disk alternatively so 
tends to be rather "noisy".

     COM files do not contain displayable data as such and so  if 
a  mismatch  is reported and you need to see what is actually  in 
that  location  in both files,  the best way is to use  the  disk 
dumper  program DDH to dump out the files....the  sector  numbers 
match the dump count as outlined above.
