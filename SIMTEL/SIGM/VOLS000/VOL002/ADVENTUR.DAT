1,You are standing at the end of a road before a small brick
1,building.  Around you is a forest.  A small stream flows out
1,of the building and down a gully.
2,You have walked up a hill, still in the forest.  The road
2,slopes back down the other side of the hill.  There is a
2,building in the distance.
3,You are inside a building, a well house for a large spring.
4,You are in a valley in the forest beside a stream tumbling
4,along a rocky bed.
5,You are in open forest, with a deep valley to one side.
6,You are in open forest near both a valley and a road.
7,At your feet all the water of the stream splashes into a
7,2-inch slit in the rock.  Downstream the streambed is bare
7,rock.
8,You are in a 20-foot depression floored with bare dirt.
8,Set into the dirt is a strong steel grate mounted in
8,concrete.  A dry streambed leads into the depression.
9,You are in a small chamber beneath a 3x3 steel grate to the
9,surface.  A low crawl over cobbles leads inward to the west.
10,You are crawling over cobbles in a low passage.  There is a
10,dim light at the east end of the passage.
11,You are in a debris room filled with stuff washed in from
11,the surface.  A low wide passage with cobbles becomes
11,plugged with mud and debris here, but an awkward canyon
11,leads upward and west.  A note on the wall says
11,"magic word XYZZY".
12,You are in an awkward sloping east/west canyon.
13,You are in a splendid chamber thirty feet high.  The walls
13,are frozen rivers of orange stone.  An awkward canyon and a
13,good passage exit from east and west sides of the chamber.
14,At your feet is a small pit breathing traces of white mist.
14,An east passage ends here except for a small crack leading
14,on.
15,You are at one end of a vast hall stretching forward out of
15,sight to the west.  There are openings to either side.
15,Nearby, a wide stone staircase leads downward.  The hall is
15,filled with wisps of white mist swaying to and fro almost as
15,if alive.  A cold wind blows up the staircase.  There is a
15,passage at the top of a dome behind you.
16,The crack is far too small for you to follow.
17,You are on the east bank of a fissure slicing clear across
17,the hall.  The mist is quite thick here, and the fissure is
17,too wide to jump.
18,This is a low room with a crude note on the wall.  The note
18,says, "You won't get it up the steps".
19,You are in the hall of the mountain king, with passages off
19,in all directions.
20,You are at the bottom of the pit with a broken neck.
21,You didn't make it.
22,The dome is unclimbable.
23,You are at the west end of the twopit room.  There is a
23,large hole in the wall above the pit at this end of the
23,room.
24,You are at the bottom of the eastern pit in the twopit room.
24,There is a small pool of oil in one corner of the pit.
25,You are at the bottom of the western pit in the twopit room.
25,There is a large hole in the wall about 25 feet above you.
26,You clamber up the plant and scurry through the hole at the
26,top.
27,You are on the west side of the fissure in the hall of
27,mists.
28,You are in a low N/S passage at a hole in the floor.  The
28,hole goes down to an E/W passage.
29,You are in the south side chamber.
30,You are in the west side chamber of the hall of the mountain
30,king.  A passage continues west and up here.
31,>$<
32,You can't get by the snake.
33,You are in a large room, with a passage to the south, a
33,passage to the west, and a wall of broken rock to the east.
33,There is a large "Y2" on a rock in the room's center.
34,You are in a jumble of rock, with cracks everywhere.
35,You're at a low window overlooking a huge pit, which extends
35,up out of sight.  A floor is indistinctly visible over 50
35,feet below.  Traces of white mist cover the floor of the
35,pit, becoming thicker to the right.  Marks in the dust
35,around the window would seem to indicate that someone has
35,been here recently.  Directly across the pit from you and 25
35,feet away there is a similar window looking into a lighted
35,room.  A shadowy figure can be seen there peering back at
35,you.
36,You are in a dirty broken passage.  To the east is a crawl.
36,To the west is a large passage.  Above you is a hole to
36,another passage.
37,You are on the brink of a small clean climbable pit.  A
37,crawl leads west.
38,You are in the bottom of a small pit with a little stream,
38,which enters and exits through tiny slits.
39,You are in a large room full of dusty rocks.  There is a big
39,hole in the floor.  There are cracks everywhere, and a
39,passage leading east.
40,You have crawled through a very low wide passage parallel to
40,and north of the hall of mists.
41,You are at the west end of hall of mists.  A low wide crawl
41,continues west and another goes north.  To the south is a
41,little passage 6 feet off the floor.
42,You are in a maze of twisty little passages, all alike.
43,You are in a maze of twisty little passages, all alike.
44,You are in a maze of twisty little passages, all alike.
45,You are in a maze of twisty little passages, all alike.

54,Dead end.
55,You are in a maze of twisty little passages, all alike.
56,Dead end.
57,You are on the brink of a thirty foot pit with a massive
57,orange column down one wall.  You could climb down here but
57,you could not get back up.  The maze continues at this
57,level.
58,Dead end.
59,You have crawled through a very low wide passage parallel to
59,and north of the hall of mists.
60,You are at the east end of a very long hall apparently
60,without side chambers.  To the east a low wide crawl slants
60,up.  To the north a round two foot hole slants down.
61,You are at the west end of a very long featureless hall.
61,The hall joins up with a narrow north/south passage.
62,You are at a crossover of a high N/S passage and a low E/W
62,one.
63,Dead end.
64,You are at a complex junction.  A low hands and knees
64,passage from the north joins a higher crawl from the east to
64,make a walking passage going west.  There is also a large
64,room above.  The air is damp here.
65,You are in bedquilt, a long east/west passage with holes
65,everywhere. _  To explore at random select north, south, up,
65,or down.
66,You are in a room whose walls resemble swiss cheese.
66,Obvious passages go west, east, NE, and NW.  Part of the
66,room is occupied by a large bedrock block.
67,You are at the east end of the twopit room.  The floor here
67,is littered with thin rock slabs, which make it easy to
67,descend the pits.  There is a path here bypassing the pits
67,to connect passages from east and west.  There are holes all
67,over, but the only big one is on the wall directly over the
67,west pit where you can't get to it.
68,You are in a large low circular chamber whose floor is an
68,immense slab fallen from the ceiling (slab room).  East and
68,west there once were large passages, but they are now filled
68,with boulders.  Low small passages go north and south, and
68,the south one quickly bends west around the boulders.
69,You are in a secret N/S canyon above a large room.
70,You are in a secret N/S canyon above a sizable passage.
71,You are in a secret canyon at a junction of three canyons,
71,bearing north, south, and SE.  The north one is as tall as
71,the other two combined.
72,You are in a large low room.  Crawls lead north, SE, and SW.
73,Dead end crawl.
74,You are in a secret canyon which here runs E/W.  It crosses
74,over a very tight canyon 15 feet below.  If you go down you
74,may not be able to get back up.
75,You are at a wide place in a very tight N/S canyon.
76,The canyon here becomes too tight to go further south.
77,You are in a tall E/W canyon.  A low tight crawl goes 3 feet
77,north and seems to open up.
78,The canyon runs into a mass of boulders -- dead end.
79,The stream flows out through a pair of 1 foot diameter sewer
79,pipes.  It would be advisable to use the exit.
80,You are in a maze of twisty little passages, all alike.
81,Dead end.
82,Dead end.

86,Dead end.
87,You are in a maze of twisty little passages, all alike.
88,You are in a long, narrow corridor stretching out of sight
88,to the west.  At the eastern end is a hole through which you
88,can see a profusion of leaves.
89,There is nothing here to climb.  Use "up" or "out" to leave
89,the pit.
90,You have climbed up the plant and out of the pit.
91,You are at the top of a steep incline above a large room.
91,You could climb down here, but you would not be able to
91,climb up.  There is a passage leading back to the north.
92,You are in the giant room.  The ceiling here is too high up
92,for your lamp to show it.  Cavernous passages lead east,
92,north, and south.  On the west wall is scrawled the
92,inscription, "FEE FIE FOE FOO" [sic].
93,The passage here is blocked by a recent cave-in.
94,You are at one end of an immense north/south passage.
95,You are in a magnificent cavern with a rushing stream, which
95,cascades over a sparkling waterfall into a roaring whirlpool
95,which disappears through a hole in the floor.  Passages exit
95,to the south and west.
96,You are in the soft room.  The walls are covered with heavy
96,curtains, the floor with a thick pile carpet.  Moss covers
96,the ceiling.
97,This is the oriental room.  Ancient oriental cave drawings
97,cover the walls.  A gently sloping passage leads upward to
97,the north, another passage leads SE, and a hands and knees
97,crawl leads west.
98,You are following a wide path around the outer edge of a
98,large cavern.  Far below, through a heavy white mist,
98,strange splashing noises can be heard.  The mist rises up
98,through a fissure in the ceiling.  The path exits to the
98,south and west.
99,You are in an alcove.  A small NW path seems to widen after
99,a short distance.  An extremely tight tunnel leads east.  It
99,looks like a very tight squeeze.  An eerie light can be seen
99,at the other end.
100,You're in a small chamber lit by an eerie green light.  An
100,extremely narrow tunnel exits to the west.  A dark corridor
100,leads NE.
101,You're in the dark-room.  A corridor leading south is the
101,only exit.
102,You are in an arched hall.  A coral passage once continued
102,up and east from here, but is now blocked by debris.  The
102,air smells of sea water.
103,You're in a large room carved out of sedimentary rock.  The
103,floor and walls are littered with bits of shells imbedded in
103,the stone.  A shallow passage proceeds downward, and a
103,somewhat steeper one leads up.  A low hands and knees
103,passage enters from the south.
104,You are in a long sloping corridor with ragged sharp walls.
105,You are in a cul-de-sac about eight feet across.
106,You are in an anteroom leading to a large passage to the
106,east.  Small passages go west and up.  The remnants of
106,recent digging are evident.  A sign in midair here says
106,"CAVE UNDER CONSTRUCTION BEYOND THIS POINT.  PROCEED AT OWN
106,RISK.  [Witt Construction Company]"
107,You are in a maze of twisty little passages, all different.
108,You are at Witt's end.  Passages lead off in *all*
108,directions.
109,You are in a north/south canyon about 25 feet across.  The
109,floor is covered by white mist seeping in from the north.
109,The walls extend upward for well over 100 feet.  Suspended
109,from some unseen point far above you, an enormous two-sided
109,mirror is hanging parallel to and midway between the canyon
109,walls.  (The mirror is obviously provided for the use of the
109,dwarves, who as you know, are extremely vain.)  A small
109,window can be seen in either wall, some fifty feet up.
110,You're at a low window overlooking a huge pit, which extends
110,up out of sight.  A floor is indistinctly visible over 50
110,feet below.  Traces of white mist cover the floor of the
110,pit, becoming thicker to the left.  Marks in the dust around
110,the window would seem to indicate that someone has been here
110,recently.  Directly across the pit from you and 25 feet away
110,there is a similar window looking into a lighted room.  A
110,shadowy figure can be seen there peering back at you.
111,A large stalactite extends from the roof and almost reaches
111,the floor below.  You could climb down it, and jump from it
111,to the floor, but having done so you would be unable to
111,reach it to climb back up.
112,You are in a little maze of twisting passages, all 
112,different.
113,You are at the edge of a large underground reservoir.  An
113,opaque cloud of white mist fills the room and rises rapidly
113,upward.  The lake is fed by a stream, which tumbles out of a
113,hole in the wall about 10 feet overhead and splashes noisily
113,into the water somewhere within the mist.  The only passage
113,goes back toward the south.
114,Dead end.
115,You are at the northeast end of an immense room, even larger
115,than the giant room.  It appears to be a repository for the
115,"ADVENTURE" program.  Massive torches far overhead bathe the
115,room with smoky yellow light.  Scattered about you can be
115,seen a pile of bottles (all of them empty), a nursery of
115,young beanstalks murmuring quietly, a bed of oysters, a
115,bundle of black rods with rusty stars on their ends, and a
115,collection of brass lanterns.  Off to one side a great many
115,dwarves are sleeping on the floor, snoring loudly.  A sign
115,nearby reads: "DO NOT DISTURB THE DWARVES!"  An immense
115,mirror is hanging against one wall, and stretches to the
115,other end of the room, where various other sundry objects
115,can be glimpsed dimly in the distance.
116,You are at the southwest end of the repository.  To one side
116,is a pit full of fierce green snakes.  On the other side is
116,a row of small wicker cages, each of which contains a little
116,sulking bird.  In one corner is a bundle of black rods with
116,rusty marks on their ends.  A large number of velvet pillows
116,are scattered about on the floor.  A vast mirror stretches
116,off to the northeast.  At your feet is a large steel grate,
116,next to which is a sign which reads, "TREASURE VAULT: Keys
116,in main office."
117,You are on one side of a large, deep chasm.  A heavy white
117,mist rising up from below obscures all view of the far side.
117,A SW path leads away from the chasm into a winding corridor.
118,You are in a long winding corridor sloping out of sight in
118,both directions.
119,You are in a secret canyon which exits to the north and 
119,east.
120,You are in a secret canyon which exits to the north and
120,east.
121,You are in a secret canyon which exits to the north and
121,east.
122,You are on the far side of the chasm.  A NE path leads away
122,from the chasm on this side.
123,You're in a long east/west corridor.  A faint rumbling noise
123,can be heard in the distance.
124,The path forks here.  The left fork leads northeast.  A dull
124,rumbling seems to get louder in that direction.  The right
124,fork leads southeast down a gentle slope.  The main corridor
124,enters from the west.
125,The walls are quite warm here.  From the north can be heard
125,a steady roar, so loud that the entire cave seems to be
125,trembling.  Another passage leads south, and a low crawl 
125,goes east.
126,You are on the edge of a breath-taking view.  Far below you
126,is an active volcano, from which great gouts of molten lava
126,come surging out, cascading back down into the depths.  The
126,glowing rock fills the farthest reaches of the cavern with a
126,blood-red glare, giving everything an eerie, macabre
126,appearance.  The air is filled with flickering sparks of ash
126,and a heavy smell of brimstone.  The walls are hot to the
126,touch, and the thundering of the volcano drowns out all
126,other sounds.  Embedded in the jagged roof far overhead are
126,myriad twisted formations composed of pure white alabaster,
126,which scatter the murky light into sinister apparitions upon
126,the walls.  To one side is a deep gorge, filled with a
126,bizarre chaos of tortured rock which seems to have been
126,crafted by the devil himself.  An immense river of fire
126,crashes out from the depths of the volcano, burns its way
126,through the gorge, and plummets into a bottomless pit far
126,off to your left.  To the right, an immense geyser of
126,blistering steam erupts continuously from a barren island in
126,the center of a sulfurous lake, which bubbles ominously.
126,The far right wall is aflame with an incandescence of its
126,own, which lends an additional infernal splendor to the
126,already hellish scene.  A dark, foreboding passage exits to
126,the south.
127,You are in a small chamber filled with large boulders.  The
127,walls are very warm, causing the air in the room to be
127,almost stifling from the heat.  The only exit is a crawl
127,heading west, through which is coming a low rumbling.
128,You are walking along a gently sloping north/south passage
128,lined with oddly shaped limestone formations.
129,You are standing at the entrance to a large, barren room.  A
129,sign posted above the entrance reads:
129,"CAUTION!  Bear in room!"
130,You are inside a barren room.  The center of the room is
130,completely empty except for some dust.  Marks in the dust
130,lead away toward the far end of the room.  The only exit is
130,the way you came in.
131,You are in a maze of twisting little passages, all
131,different.
132,You are in a little maze of twisty passages, all different.
133,You are in a twisting maze of little passages, all
133,different.

1,Somewhere nearby is colossal cave, where others have found
1,fortunes in treasure and gold, though it is rumored that
1,some who enter are never seen again.  Magic is said to work
1,in the cave.  I will be your eyes and hands.  Direct me with
1,commands of 1 or 2 words.  I should warn you that I look at
1,only the first four letters of each word, so you'll have to
1,enter "northeast" as "ne" to distinguish it from "north",
1,and "down" as "descend" or just "d" to distinguish it from
1,"downstream".  (Should you get stuck, type "help" for some
1,general hints.  For information on how to end your
1,adventure, etc., type "info".)

1,This is version A02, by Mike Goetz (NYACC) 4/23/80.
2,A little dwarf with a big knife blocks your way.
3,A little dwarf just walked around a corner, saw you, threw
3,a little axe at you which missed, cursed, and ran away.
4,There is a threatening little dwarf in the room with you!
5,One sharp nasty knife is thrown at you!
6,None of them hit you!
7,One of them gets you!
8,A hollow voice says "PLUGH".
9,There is no way to go that direction.
10,I am unsure how you are facing.  Use compass points or
10,nearby objects.
11,I don't know in from out here.  Use compass points or name
11,something in the general direction you want to go.
12,I don't know how to apply that word here.
13,I don't understand that!
14,I'm game.  Would you care to explain how?
15,Sorry, but I am not allowed to give more detail.  I will
15,repeat the long description of your location.
16,It is now pitch dark.  If you proceed you will likely fall
16,into a pit.
17,If you prefer, simply type w rather than west.
18,Are you trying to catch the bird?
19,The bird is frightened right now and you cannot catch it no
19,matter what you try.  Perhaps you might try later.
20,Are you trying to somehow deal with the snake?
21,You can't kill the snake, or drive it away, or avoid it, or
21,anything like that.  There is a way to get by, but you don't
21,have the necessary resources right now.
22,Do you really want to quit now?
23,You fell into a pit and broke every bone in your body!
24,You are already carrying it!
25,You can't be serious!
26,The bird was unafraid when you entered, but as you approach
26,it becomes disturbed and you cannot catch it.
27,You can catch the bird, but you cannot carry it.
28,There is nothing here with a lock!
29,You aren't carrying it!
30,The little bird attacks the green snake, and in an
30,astounding flurry drives the snake away.
31,You have no keys!
32,It has no lock.
33,I don't know how to lock or unlock such a thing.
34,It was already locked.
35,The grate is now locked.
36,The grate is now unlocked.
37,It was already unlocked.
38,You have no source of light.
39,Your lamp is now on.
40,Your lamp is now off.
41,There is no way to get past the bear to unlock the chain,
41,which is probably just as well.
42,Nothing happens.
43,Where?
44,There is nothing here to attack.
45,The little bird is now dead.  Its body disappears.
46,Attacking the snake both doesn't work and is very dangerous.
47,You killed a little dwarf.
48,You attack a little dwarf, but he dodges out of the way.
49,With what?  Your bare hands?
50,Good try, but that is an old worn-out magic word.
51,I know of places, actions, and things.  Most of my
51,vocabulary describes places and is used to move you there.
51,To move, try words like forest, building, downstream, enter,
51,east, west, north, south, up, or down.  I know about a few
51,special objects, like a black rod hidden in the cave.  These
51,objects can be manipulated using some of the action words
51,that I know.  Usually you will need to give both the object
51,and action words (in either order), but sometimes I can
51,infer the object from the verb alone.  Some objects also
51,imply verbs; in particular, "inventory" implies "take
51,inventory", which causes me to give you a list of what
51,you're carrying.  The objects have side effects; for
51,instance, the rod scares the bird.  Usually people having
51,trouble moving just need to try a few more words.  Usually
51,people trying unsuccessfully to manipulate an object are
51,attempting something beyond their (or my!) capabilities and
51,should try a completely different tack.  To speed the game
51,you can sometimes move long distances with a single word.
51,For example, "building" usually gets you to the building
51,from anywhere above ground except when lost in the forest.
51,Also, note that cave passages turn a lot, and that leaving a
51,room to the north does not guarantee entering the next from
51,the south.
51,Good luck!
52,It misses!
53,It gets you!
54,OK
55,You can't unlock the keys.
56,You have crawled around in some little holes and wound up
56,back in the main passage.
57,I don't know where the cave is, but hereabouts no stream can
57,run on the surface for long.  I would try the stream.
58,I need more detailed instructions to do that.
59,I can only tell you what you see as you move about and
59,manipulate things.  I cannot tell you where remote things
59,are.
60,I don't know that word.
61,What?
62,Are you trying to get into the cave?
63,The grate is very solid and has a hardened steel lock.  You
63,cannot enter without a key, and there are no keys nearby.  I
63,would recommend looking elsewhere for the keys.
64,The trees of the forest are large hardwood oak and maple,
64,with an occasional grove of pine or spruce.  There is quite
64,a bit of undergrowth, largely birch and ash saplings plus
64,nondescript bushes of various sorts.  This time of year
64,visibility is quite restricted by all the leaves, but travel
64,is quite easy if you detour around the spruce and berry
64,bushes.
65,Welcome to Adventure!!  Would you like instructions?
66,Digging without a shovel is quite impractical.  Even with a
66,shovel progress is unlikely.
67,Blasting requires dynamite.
68,I'm as confused as you are.
69,Mist is a white vapor, usually water, seen from time to time
69,in caverns.  It can be found anywhere but is frequently a
69,sign of a deep pit leading down to water.
70,Your feet are now wet.
71,I think I just lost my appetite.
72,Thank you, it was delicious!
73,You have taken a drink from the stream.  The water tastes
73,strongly of minerals, but is not unpleasant.  It is
73,extremely cold.
74,The bottle of water is now empty.
75,Rubbing the electric lamp is not particularly rewarding.
75,Anyway, nothing exciting happens.
76,Peculiar.  Nothing unexpected happens.
77,Your bottle is empty and the ground is wet.
78,You can't pour that.
79,Watch it!
80,Which way?
81,Oh dear, you seem to have gotten yourself killed.  I might
81,be able to help you out, but I've never really done this
81,before.  Do you want me to try to reincarnate you?
82,All right.  But don't blame me if something goes wr......
82,                    --- POOF!! ---
82,You are engulfed in a cloud of orange smoke.  Coughing and
82,gasping, you emerge from the smoke and find....
83,You clumsy oaf, you've done it again!  I don't know how long
83,I can keep this up.  Do you want me to try reincarnating you
83,again?
84,Okay, now where did I put my orange smoke?....  >POOF!<
84,Everything disappears in a dense cloud of orange smoke.
85,Now you've really done it!  I'm out of orange smoke!  You
85,don't expect me to do a decent reincarnation without any
85,orange smoke, do you?
86,Okay, if you're so smart, do it yourself!  I'm leaving!
90,>>> messages 81 thru 90 are reserved for "obituaries". <<<
91,Sorry, but I no longer seem to remember how it was you got
91,here.
92,You can't carry anything more.  You'll have to drop
92,something first.
93,You can't go through a locked steel grate!
94,I believe what you want is right here with you.
95,You don't fit through a two-inch slit!
96,I respectfully suggest you go across the bridge instead of
96,jumping.
97,There is no way across the fissure.
98,You're not carrying anything.
99,You are currently holding the following:
100,It's not hungry (it's merely pinin' for the fjords).
100,Besides, you have no bird seed.
101,The snake has now devoured your bird.
102,There's nothing here it wants to eat (except perhaps you).
103,You fool, dwarves eat only coal!  Now you've made him
103,*REALLY* mad!!
104,You have nothing in which to carry it.
105,Your bottle is already full.
106,There is nothing here with which to fill the bottle.
107,Your bottle is now full of water.
108,Your bottle is now full of oil.
109,You can't fill that.
110,Don't be ridiculous!
111,The door is extremely rusty and refuses to open.
112,The plant indignantly shakes the oil off its leaves and
112,asks, "water?"
113,The hinges are quite thoroughly rusted now and won't budge.
114,The oil has freed up the hinges so that the door will now
114,move, although it requires some effort.
115,The plant has exceptionally deep roots and cannot be pulled
115,free.
116,The dwarves' knives vanish as they strike the walls of the
116,cave.
117,Something you're carrying won't fit through the tunnel with
117,you.  You'd best take inventory and drop something.
118,You can't fit this five-foot clam through that little
118,passage!
119,You can't fit this five-foot oyster through that little
119,passage!
120,I advise you to put down the clam before opening it.
120,>Strain!<
121,I advise you to put down the oyster before opening it.
121,>Wrench!<
122,You don't have anything strong enough to open the clam.
123,You don't have anything strong enough to open the oyster.
124,A glistening pearl falls out of the clam and rolls away.
124,Goodness, this must really be an oyster.  (I never was very
124,good at identifying bivalves.)  Whatever it is, it has now
124,snapped shut again.
125,The oyster creaks open, revealing nothing but oyster inside.
125,It promptly snaps shut again.
126,You have crawled around in some little holes and found your
126,way blocked by a recent cave-in.  You are now back in the
126,main passage.
127,There are faint rustling noises from the darkness behind
127,you.
128,Out from the shadows behind you pounces a bearded pirate!
128,"Har, har," he chortles, "I'll just take all this booty and
128,hide it away with me chest deep in the maze!"  He snatches
128,your treasure and vanishes into the gloom.
129,A sepulchral voice reverberating through the cave, says,
129,"Cave closing soon.  All adventurers exit immediately
129,through main office."
130,A mysterious recorded voice groans into life and announces:
130,   "This exit is closed.  Please leave via main office."
131,It looks as though you're dead.  Well, seeing as how it's so
131,close to closing time anyway, I think we'll just call it a
131,day.
132,The sepulchral voice entones, "The cave is now closed."  As
132,the echoes fade, there is a blinding flash of light (and a
132,small puff of orange smoke). . . .    As your eyes refocus,
132,you look around and find...
133,There is a loud explosion, and a twenty-foot hole appears in
133,the far wall, burying the dwarves in the rubble.  You march
133,through the hole and find yourself in the main office, where
133,a cheering band of friendly elves carry the conquering
133,adventurer off into the sunset.
134,There is a loud explosion, and a twenty-foot hole appears in
134,the far wall, burying the snakes in the rubble.  A river of
134,molten lava pours in through the hole, destroying everything
134,in its path, including you!
135,There is a loud explosion, and you are suddenly splashed
135,across the walls of the room.
136,The resulting ruckus has awakened the dwarves.  There are
136,now several threatening little dwarves in the room with you!
136,Most of them throw knives at you!  All of them get you!
137,Oh, leave the poor unhappy bird alone.
138,I daresay whatever you want is around here somewhere.
139,I don't know the word "stop".  Use "quit" if you want to
139,give up.
140,You can't get there from here.
141,You are being followed by a very large, tame bear.
142,If you want to end your adventure early, say "quit".
142,To suspend your adventure such that you can continue
142,later, say "suspend" (or "pause" or "save").  To see
142,how well you're doing, say "score".  To get full credit for
142,a treasure, you must have left it safely in the building,
142,though you get partial credit just for locating it.  You
142,lose points for getting killed, or for quitting, though the
142,former costs you more.  There are also points based on how
142,much (if any) of the cave you've managed to explore; in
142,particular, there is a large bonus just for getting in (to
142,distinguish the beginners from the rest of the pack), and
142,there are other ways to determine whether you've been
142,through some of the more harrowing sections.  If you think
142,you've found all the treasures, just keep exploring for a
142,while.  If nothing interesting happens, you haven't found
142,them all yet.  If something interesting *DOES* happen, it
142,means you're getting a bonus and have an opportunity to
142,garner many more points in the master's section.  I may
142,occasionally offer hints if you seem to be having trouble.
142,If I do, I'll warn you in advance how much it will affect
142,your score to accept the hints.  Finally, to save time or
142,paper, you may specify "brief", which tells me never to
142,repeat the full description of a place unless you explicitly
142,ask me to.
143,Do you indeed wish to quit now?
144,There is nothing here with which to fill the vase.
145,The sudden change in temperature has delicately shattered
145,the vase.
146,It is beyond your power to do that.
147,I don't know how.
148,It is too far up for you to reach.
149,You killed a little dwarf.  The body vanishes in a cloud of
149,greasy black smoke.
150,The shell is very strong and is impervious to attack.
151,What's the matter, can't you read?  Now you'd best start
151,over.
152,The axe bounces harmlessly off the dragon's thick scales.
153,The dragon looks rather nasty.  You'd best not try to get
153,by.
154,The little bird attacks the green dragon, and in an
154,astounding flurry gets burnt to a cinder.  The ashes blow
154,away.
155,On what?
156,Okay, from now on I'll only describe a place in full the
156,first time you come to it.  To get the full description, say
156,"look".
157,Trolls are close relatives with the rocks and have skin as
157,tough as that of a rhinoceros.  The troll fends off your
157,blows effortlessly.
158,The troll deftly catches the axe, examines it carefully, and
158,tosses it back, declaring, "Good workmanship, but it's not
158,valuable enough."
159,The troll catches your treasure and scurries away out of
159,sight.
160,The troll refuses to let you cross.
161,There is no longer any way across the chasm.
162,Just as you reach the other side, the bridge buckles beneath
162,the weight of the bear, which was still following you
162,around.  You scrabble desperately for support, but as the
162,bridge collapses you stumble back and fall into the chasm.
163,The bear lumbers toward the troll, who lets out a startled
163,shriek and scurries away.  The bear soon gives up the
163,pursuit and wanders back.
164,The axe misses and lands near the bear where you can't get
164,at it.
165,With what?  Your bare hands?  Against *HIS* bear hands??
166,The bear is confused; he only wants to be your friend.
167,For crying out loud, the poor thing is already dead!
168,The bear eagerly wolfs down your food, after which he seems
168,to calm down considerably and even becomes rather friendly.
169,The bear is still chained to the wall.
170,The chain is still locked.
171,The chain is now unlocked.
172,The chain is now locked.
173,There is nothing here to which the chain can be locked.
174,There is nothing here to eat.
175,Do you want the hint?
176,Do you need help getting out of the maze?
177,You can make the passages look less alike by dropping
177,things.
178,Are you trying to explore beyond the plover room?
179,There is a way to explore that region without having to
179,worry about falling into a pit.  None of the objects
179,available is immediately useful in discovering the secret.
180,Do you need help getting out of here?
181,Don't go west.
182,Gluttony is not one of the troll's vices.  Avarice, however,
182,is.
183,Your lamp is getting dim.  You'd best start wrapping this
183,up, unless you can find some fresh batteries.  I seem to
183,recall there's a vending machine in the maze.  Bring some
183,coins with you.
184,Your lamp has run out of power.
185,There's not much point in wandering around out here, and you
185,can't explore the cave without a lamp.  So let's just call
185,it a day.
186,There are faint rustling noises from the darkness behind
186,you.  As you turn toward them, the beam of your lamp falls
186,across a bearded pirate.  He is carrying a large chest.
186,"Shiver me timbers!" he cries, "I've been spotted!  I'd best
186,hie meself off to the maze to hide me chest!"  With that, he
186,vanishes into the gloom.
187,Your lamp is getting dim.  You'd best go back for those
187,batteries.
188,Your lamp is getting dim.  I'm taking the liberty of
188,replacing the batteries.
189,Your lamp is getting dim, and you're out of spare batteries.
189,You'd best start wrapping this up.
190,I'm afraid the magazine is written in Dwarvish.
191,"This is not the maze where the pirate leaves his treasure
191,chest."
192,Hmmm, this looks like a clue, which means it'll cost you 10
192,points to read it.  Should i go ahead and read it anyway?
193,It says, "There is something strange about this place, such
193,that one of the words I've always known now has a new
193,effect."
194,It says the same thing it did before.
195,I'm afraid I don't understand.
196,"Congratulations on bringing light into the dark-room!"
197,You strike the mirror a resounding blow, whereupon it
197,shatters into myriad tiny fragments.
198,You have taken the vase and hurled it delicately to the
198,ground.
199,You prod the nearest dwarf, who wakes up grumpily, takes one
199,look at you, curses, and grabs for his axe.
200,Is this acceptable?
201,There's no point in suspending a demonstration game.
202,Do you really want to suspend this game?
203,Be sure to save (SAVE ADSAVE.COM 157) your core-image...
