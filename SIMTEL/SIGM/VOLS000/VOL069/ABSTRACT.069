      Cincinnati Control Dynamics Inc. in Ohio took the trouble

      Computer Graphics "(written by Franklin Crow) published in
      "Byte" of March & April (1981). For those of you who pursue 
      this to a successful conclusion let us know. Even better,

2.   Roy Allen ,of Mill Valley, California  combined a Game with 
     Pascal/Z's direct File access tï  comå  uğ  witè aî excellenô 
     Demo®  Thå gamå  ió  aî  olä favorite called ANIMALS. 
     Everything that ANIMALS learns is containeä  iî thå paiò oæ 
     fileó calleä Beasts®  Iæ fileó  bù those names are not found 
     on the currently-logged disk, the program will create a new 
     set of files. It starts out with only two animals so you'll 
     have to have your kids teach it  some.

3.   Ray Penley is working in a computer store called BIT-WIT in
     Clinton¬  Marylanä  sï  wherå  hå  getó thå  timå  tï  writå

          This first group is a Terminal installation program. It

                                   included in user's program.
     TERMIO.LIB                    Edited version  that is to be
                                   included in Pascal program.

     TERMIO.FIL                    Terminal data file.

     Ray also included a clever little game to demostrate how his
     INSTALL program works. It looks for the terminal data file
     "TERMIO.FIL". The game moves three characters around on the
     terminaì  screen®  Characteró directionó maù bå  changeä  iî

       The bench check that was used to compare MT+ and Pascal/Z
     wasn't correct in that Byte article. So when I looked at it
     I cleaned it up but the reason I am including it here is not
     the bench check aspect but the algorithm. It had some pretty
     shifty thinking. So I included it just as a curosity item.

       MILEAGE came out of the class room. I cleaned it up and
     adapted it to Pascal/Z. It'll figure out your MPG.
