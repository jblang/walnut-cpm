        attributes CP/M 2.X file names.  Assemble using MAC.

        Remember  that Digital Research reserves flags F5 through F8  and 
        T3.  Application programs should use only T1-T4.

        It  is  assumed that you will be using FLAGS with a fairly  fast 
        CRT terminal.  You'll really hate it on a printing terminal.

        You  have to set several equates to match  your  terminal.   You 
        need  to  have  a  screen clear  character.   If  your  terminal 
        supports  a  Home  Cursor character,  you may  use  it  to  make 
        updating the screen a bit easier.

        Hopefully  more  people will write utilities that can be  easily 
        configured without requiring fancy terminals.

        I  plan to release a version that will allow flags to be  updated 
        in multiple files.

        If you have trouble with FLAGS,  make "improvements" or want  to 
        make suggestions please let me know.
