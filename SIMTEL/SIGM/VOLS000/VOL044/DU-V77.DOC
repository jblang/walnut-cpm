	HOW TO USE DU ver 7.7 DISK UTILITY

INSTALLATION:
	The 7.0 and later versions of DU are designed to
  be installed with a minimum of trouble.  In fact, in al-
  most all cases, no changes to the source file should be
  necessary to get DU up and running. This is because DU
  uses the disk paramter block of CP/M to determine the
  characteristics of the disk environment.  (see the dis-
  claimer for certain non-standard versions of CP/M 1.4).
	The only parameter that should need to be changed
  will be the clock speed flag at 103H.  Leave this byte
  zero if you have a 2 mhz clock.  Patch it non-zero for
  4 mhz.  This is only needed for the "Z" (sleep) command.

USE:

Any valid command string may be placed as an
operand of the original DU command, i.e.:

     A>DU G0;D;G2;=OK<D><A><1A>;D

Functions supported:

	Tnn	Seek to track nn (no read)
	Snn	Position to sector nn, and read
	Gnn	Position to group nn and read.
	G	Shows current position
	V	Views the current sector.
		(assumes ASCII data)
	Vnn	Views nn sectors
	Fname	print directory for file "name",
		then positions to its directory 
		sector. (Won't position under
		CP/M 2.x, but see = command below.)

	=string	Ascii search, starting at current
		sector. <xx> hex may be imbedded,
		or used alone:  To find "IN 0FEH":
		=<db><fe>
		Ignores bit 7 unless <xx> is used.

	L	Re-logs in the current disk. You may pull
		out a disk, put in a new, and "L" just
		to log it in.

	Lx	Logs in disk 'x', such as: LB

	Ux	Logs user 'x' for next F command.  Gives
		'?' error if not CP/M version 2.x.

	D	Dump sector, hex + ASCII
	A	Dump sector, ASCII only
	H	Dump sector, hex only

note all dump commands (D, A, H) may be optionally
	followed by a starting and ending address:
	D0,7F	is the same as just D
	D3,5
	A20,3F

	CHaddr,val,val,val... change hex in sector
	CAaddr,char string... change ASCII in sector
		NOTE that <xx> may be hex imbedded
		in the Ascii:  ca0,OK<d><a><1a>

		----> Use W to write changes to disk.
		Note that the C command echoes
		the overlaid data for verification.

	CHaddr-addr,byte
 or	CAaddr-addr,byte	repeats a change

	+	advance 1 sector (if below track 2,
		this advances to next numerical, if
		2 or >, advances based on CP/M's normal
		sector scrambling algorithm, i.e. so +
		will get the next logical sector of the file

	-	backs up 1 logical sector

		Note + and - may take an amount:
		for example, +F steps in 15 sectors.

		Note also that "-" issued at the first logical
		sector of the disk will wrap back to the last.
		Further, "+" issued at the last sector will
		wrap forward to the first.

	?	Gives command summary

	#	Prints the disk parameters

	M	Dumps a map of the group allocations
		for files.
	Mn	Shows which file is allocated to
		group "n".

	N	Resets CP/M via the BDOS.  This may
		make it possible under some implementations
		of CP/M to change the disk format (e.g., density,
		sides, etc)

	R	Reads the sector currently positioned to
		into memory.  Note R (Read) is implicit in
		the G, +, and - commands, but N-O-T in the
		S and T commands (I did it because I was
		tired of disk reading after T command before
		I had a chance to issue the S command)

	W	Write back the current sector (N-O-T-E may
		not be used after an F command, as CP/M was
		used to find the file in the directory

	X	Exit back to CP/M (Must press return).  Ctl-c
		was too easy to hit over modem lines, so I
		decided on 2-byte (X, CR) to exit.

	P	Toggle printer switch on/off

	Y       Yanks current sector into sequential memory and
		prints ending address.  This allows sectors to
		be written sequentially into memory starting at
		3000H, for later recovery by DDT, etc.

	Z	Sleep - causes the program to pause, such
		as to look at a dump.  Z is 1 sec.  Znn
		is nn tenths of a second on a 2 MHz 8080.

	<	Saves current sector in a save buffer

	>	Gets saved buffer.  < and > may be used
		to move a sector to another place.

	/	Repeats entire command.  Defaults
 or	/nn	to "forever".  NN may be 2 to 65535

multiple commands may be separated by ";"

Example: the following commands will erase the
	 b disk directory to all E5's:

	lb		log in b drive
	g0		position to dir.
	ch0-7f,e5	fill with e5
	<		save the sector
	>;w;+;/16	restore, write, next,
			repeat 16

----This could be shortened to:

	lb;g0;ch0-7f,e5;<
	>;w;+;/16



INTERPRETATION OF DIRECTORY DATA PRESENTED BY THE DU PROGRAM


The following explains the format of a CP/M directory entry
as shown by DU, using either the "F" (find file) command,
or just doing "D" (dump) of the directory sectors, which
are located in groups 0 and 1 on a single density disk.
