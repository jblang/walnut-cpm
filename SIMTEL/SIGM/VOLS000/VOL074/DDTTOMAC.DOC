        DDTTOMAC  is a special purpose editor used to  convert 
DDT  format disassembly files into a format acceptable to MAC, 
ASM  or  MACRO-80.   To use it,  you will need to be  able  to 
divert  your console output to a disk file while using DDT  to 
disassemble  a  program using the L  command.   Diverting  the 
console  output  may  be done by trapping  console  output  at 
either  the BDOS entry point or the BIOS (in the latter  case, 
watch   out   for  re-entrancy  problems   with   the   BDOS). 
Alternatively,  Acoustic Electronic Developments market a CP/M 
utility  package  which contains a spooler program to  perform 
this function.

        The program is invoked by the command lines:

        A>DDTTOMAC <file1>
   or   A>DDTTOMAC <file1> <file2>

where  the  first  form edits <file1>  to  produce  a  console 
listing  and the second writes the edited version to  <file2>. 
Two  pass  operation  is  used  and  the  program  is  neither 
particularly  fast nor elegant - it was written in a hurry  to 
fill  a  particular need.   The source listing (in BDS  C)  is 
included on the disk.

        In   its   present  form,   the  program  strips   the 
hexadecimal addresses from the start of each  instruction  and 
substitutes labels for 2 byte operand values.  If the  operand 
is  the  address  of an instruction within the  range  of  the 
disassembly.  the  label  is  inserted at the  correct  point, 
otherwise  it  is  set  to the  correct  value  by  an  EQUate 
statement at the end of the listing.   Lines not recognised as 
valid  DDT listing format are commented out.   It should  work 
satisfactorily in both CP/M 1.4 and 2.2 systems.
