DOC File for PCPATCH, Bill Bolton, Software Tools, Australia

PCPATCH  is  a patch for PIP version 1.5 (as distributed  with 
CP/M  2.2)  to  convert it into a program  I  call  PC.  After 
overlaying  PCPATCH  over PIP rename the file to PC  (for  PIP 
Continue)  and use it as described below.  Its a bit of a hack 
but it works just fine. 

Syntax:-

PC  Drive:=[Drive:]unambiguous file name[normal pip options]

This  will  do an automatic *.* file transfer EXCEPT that  the 
file  transfer will start from the specified unambiguous  file 
name rather than the start of the directory. 

    ----> DO NOT USE ANY OF THE OTHER PIP FUNCTIONS <----

This program is only useful for continuing a PIP copy. It is a 
modified version oof the standard CP/M 2.2 PIP utility.

Example:-

Start with PIP *.*
When you get DISK WRITE ERROR
Then erase resulting $$$ file on destination disk
Cahnge destination disk  and the....
PC B:=A:MBASIC.COM

This  will  copy from  MBASIC.COM through to  the end  of  the 
directory or until space is exhausted on the destination disk.
