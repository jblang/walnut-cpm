This is an example of a .DOC file which goes along with a DIMS data file.
It was written by giving the command "doc" when the articles file was open.
It may be read the same way.

The data file "articles" was created from my large magazine article data-base
by using the edit command "copy find data" and answering "yes" to all re-
cords that had to do with data-base management systems.
