DIMS editor help file - January 16, 1982

     If there's a record number or a pair of record numbers anywhere in the 
command line, the command will be done on the specified range of records.
The words "from" "to" "all" "end" or "last" may be used when talking about
record numbers.  "." instead of a number means use the most recently dis-
played record.  All the built-in commands may be shortened to three letters.

	For example, all the following are valid commands:

			add
			delete from 10 to 20
			delete 10 20
			print to 75
			print select labels
			find Wombat from . to 500
			change 57
			change .  (means change last record shown)
			10 20
			list from 10 to 20 (same result as "10 20"
			select copy delete

These commands are normally the last word in the command sentence, any fol- 
lowing words except record numbers will be ignored.

	add	Appends records to the end of the file, prompting field by 
                field.  In this mode the following commands take effect:

               	"stop" alone in any field quits adding.
               	"\" (backslash) at end of any field skips back 1 field.
               	";" alone in the field copies data from last record shown.

        done    Closes file and returns to no-file menu

        fields  Allows "hiding" fields you don't want to show.  You may un-hide
                them with the same command.  Controls output of 'put.'

        format 0      Installs default display and print formats.
        formats       Shows available format definition files.
        format <name> Installs named format definition for screen and printer.

        backup  Makes complete new backup file from main file.  Rarely used 
                since backup file is maintained automatically.

	renumber Renumbers all records sequentially from the top in both main 
                and backup files, closing up holes from deleted records.

The following commands may be given freely anywhere in the command line:

	change <#> Shows record or records field by field, new data may be 
                entered for each field or the old data may be kept by just 
                hitting RETURN.  To erase a field enter just one space then
                RETURN.  Backslash '\' backs up to previous field.

	delete <#> Shows record or records and asks approval to erase.

	list	Shows records.  Assumed if no final command is given.

	find <word> Finds records containing the exact word string.  A phrase 
                can be found if underlines_are_used_instead_of_spaces.

	select	Finds records containing up to 10 different words or phrases, 
                (you will be asked for them) in all fields or in specific 
                fields.  You also can specify up to 10 words or phrases that 
                will cause the record to be skipped.

	print	Prints on list device rather than screen in current format.

	copy	Copies data records and adds them on to the end of another
                DIMS file.  You will be asked for the name.  You may create a 
                new file this way or add to an existing one, but the field 
                definitions must be the same.  New records have no auto backup.

	and	Permitted for clarity, ignored.

	page	Sets page number to start printout with.

	margin	Sets printer margin if you don't want the default setting.

	flag	In an add or a change to a range of records, asks you for a 
                string to be added to any (one) field in the record.

	programs  Shows a directory of available "transient commands," i.e. 
                  various batch processes than can work on the file.



DIMS editor help screen 5        --> TRANSIENT COMMANDS <--
Transient commands are sub-programs which do a batch of work and then return
you to DEDIT.  Where appropriate, they will take a range of records and selec-
tion criteria from the command line.  Example:  print select labels 100 to 150

	cform	Process for creating format definition files.  Complicated.

	doc	A "notepad" where you can read or write notes associated with 
                the data file.  The doc file can be edited later with WordStar.
                Useful for remembering codes you invent for your file.

	labels	Prints a batch of labels (use "print labels") with blank fields
                closed up.  Works only with three standard address file formats
                that will do for most jobs, not hard to modify if necessary.

	letters	Merges an address file with a form letter.  A personal 
                salutation line or other data lines may be included if desired.
                DLETTERS.BAS must be modified for each job.

	sort	Sorts the records into a new sequence in the whole file or a 
                range of the file.  Asks questions for set-up.  Sorts 
                alphabetically unless all fields specified for keys are 
                numeric.  May overlay or make a new file.
DIMS editor help screen 6 -- more transient commands

	stat	Computes descriptive statistics for a selected field.

	put	Makes an output file in standard Basic sequential form for
		further processing with other programs.  You may select a
		range of records in the invoking command line, and selection
		specifications.

	get	Stuffs a conventional Basic sequential data file into
		the DIMS file from which it is called, adding records to
		the end.  Allows skipping and re-ordering of fields.
