1.0  General description

The  Z-80 Floppy Disk Test is a general purpose utility for testing or
initializing a diskette.  It requires a Z-80 microprocessor, at  least
16  kbytes  of random access memory, two flexible disk drives, and the
Digital Research CP/M 2.x operating system.  Program mode and area  of
diskette to be tested are controlled from the keyboard.  Errors may be
audited on the console or the line printer.  

As supplied on the distribution diskette, the program is configured to
test  a  soft-sectored, single density disk with 77 tracks, 26 sectors
per track, and 128 byte sectors.  If you are using a different type of
disk drive, the number of tracks  and/or  sectors  per  track  may  be
specified during the initialization dialogue.

The program does not exhaustively check out the disk  drive,  and  any
errors  detected  by  the  program  must  be  interpreted  with  care.
Intermittent  errors  occurring  throughout  a  broad  range  of  disk
addresses  probably  indicate  a  problem  with  the  disk drive unit.
Errors indicated at consistent addresses within  adjacent  tracks  may
result  from a worn or damaged flexible disk.  Error free execution of
the test certainly indicates an intact and usable diskette,  and  also
is  fairly good evidence of proper operation of your disk drive.  Note
that the program is rather insensitive to drive  problems  related  to
head  movement, since the diskette is addressed in a smooth sequential
manner.


2.0  Installation

Mount  your system disk in drive A, and the distribution disk in drive
B.  Use the PIP utility to transfer the test program onto  the  system
disk:

        A>pip a:=b:dtst.com [v]

Now  remove  the  distribution  disk  from drive B and store it as the
backup copy.


3.0  Using the Test Program

Put your system disk in drive A, boot up the CP/M operating system, and
type:

        A>dtst

The test program will load  into  memory  and  print  the  identifying
message:

        Laboratory Microsystems Disk Test version 1.0

If there is inadequate memory in the transient program area, or if the
operating  system is not CP/M version 2.0 or greater, the program will
immediately print a warning message and  exit.   Otherwise,  the  test
proceeds  to  the initialization dialogue.  The test mode is set via a
series of questions presented on the system console.  Answers  calling
for  an  alphabetic  character  may be upper or lower case; a carriage
return is not required.  Answers calling for  a  number  must  be  two
digits, or one digit followed by a carriage return.

Itemize errors?         Y or N          If   answered  y,  each  error
                                        detected  is  audited  on  the
                                        selected  device.  If answered
                                        N, only the total error  count
                                        is  printed at the end of each
                                        pass.

Console or Printer?     C or P          If  itemizing  errors,  select
                                        the   device   on   which  the
                                        itemized error listing will be
                                        printed.

Lock on read or write?  N, R, or W      N = no locks.   R  =  lock  on
                                        read  mode (no data is written
                                        to the  disk  ---  useful  for
                                        detecting any damaged areas on
                                        the media).  W = lock on write
                                        (all   data  on  the  disk  is
                                        destroyed --- this may be used
                                        to erase a  diskette  by  also
                                        locking on pattern)

Restore original data?  Y or N          Y  =  restore existing data on
                                        diskette  after  testing  each
                                        sector.   N  =  do not restore
                                        existing data.  Test runs much
                                        faster when  restore  mode  is
                                        not used.

Lock on data pattern?   Y or N          Y  =  user  wishes  to specify
                                        specific data to  be  used  as
                                        the  test pattern.  N = random
                                        data pattern is  generated  by
                                        the test program.

Enter data pattern      hex 00-FF       If  you  answered Y to Lock On
                                        Pattern, enter the  eight  bit
                                        data pattern to be used during
                                        disk testing.  If you answered
                                        N, this question is bypassed.

Drive to be tested      B, C, or D      Specify  disk drive to be used
                                        for  diskette   testing.    In
                                        order  to  prevent  accidental
                                        destruction  of   the   system
                                        disk,  the  use  of drive A is
                                        not allowed.

Test all tracks?        Y or N          Y = test all tracks (00-76) in
                                        sequence.  N = user wishes  to
                                        specify  range  of tracks (may
                                        be used to test only part of a
                                        diskette, or if disk drive  is
                                        other  than  standard  8  inch

                                        Tracks,   specify   here   the
                                        number  of  the  last track to
                                        test.  Must  be  the  same  or
                                        greater than the number of the
                                        first track to test.

Test all sectors?       Y or N          Y = test all sectors (1-26) in
                                        sequence.   N = user wishes to
                                        specify range of sectors  (may
                                        be  used  to test only part of
                                        each track, or if  disk  drive
                                        is  other than standard 8 inch
                                        single density).

First sector to test    decimal 01-26   If you answered N to Test  All
                                        Sectors,   specify   here  the
                                        number of the first sector  to
                                        test on each track.

Last sector to test     decimal 01-26   If  you answered N to Test All
                                        Sectors,  specify   here   the
                                        number  of  the last sector to
                                        test on each track.   Must  be
                                        the  same  or greater than the
                                        number of the first sector  to
                                        test.

How many test passes?   decimal 01-99   Enter   the   number  of  test
                                        passes  to  be  made  on   the
                                        diskette.   At  least one pass
                                        is always  made  even  if  you
                                        enter zero.

After entry of the number of  test  passes,  the  program  immediately
begins  executing.  The program may be interrupted by pushing any key,
however response may be delayed for several seconds depending  on  the
speed  of  the  processor  and  disk  drive.   Do not stop the test by
resetting the computer system  if  you  are  using  restore  mode,  or
unpredictable amounts of data may be lost.


4.0  Error Listing

Errors  detected  by the program may be itemized on the system console
or the line printer.  The pass, drive name, track,  and  sector  where
the error occurred are listed.  All numbers are in decimal.  The error
type is designated at the right.  In the explanations below, "hardware
error" signifies an error status code returned from the low level disk
driver, and usually means a CRC fault or seek incomplete.

                                back for verification.


5.0  Program areas of interest to users

To  use  the  program  on  other  types  of disk drives, it may become
necessary to change the first two locations given below.  This may  be
done  be  reading  in  the  COM  file  with  DDT, patching the desired
location, and SAVEing a new COM file.

0119H   (8  bits)  Sector skew flag.  If byte=0, skew is not used.  If
        byte=1,  remap  sector  numbers  as  given   in   the   sector
        translation  table.   On  Z-80  systems  at 4 mhz, skew is not
        needed and this byte may be left zero.  On systems with slower
        processors, test speed may be improved by use of skew.

0121H   (8  bits)  Contains the number of digits to be accepted by the
        numeric input routines during the initialization dialogue, the
        value is two in the distributed version.  If test is to run on
        a drive with greater than 99 tracks, change the value of  this
        byte to three.

0122H   (16  bits)  Contains  the  address  of  the sector translation
        table.  In the distributed program, the table is built with  a
        skew factor of three, and is 26 bytes long.
