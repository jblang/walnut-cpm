     This disk is almost all utilities. All rather large programs 
also. As you will notice, we are getting software from just about 
everywhere. The more the merrier, as they say.

1.    This  is  a  professional  effort.  What  I  mean  is  that 
     Laboratory Microsystems is selling this Disk Test program on 
     the  open  market.  Yet,  when I asked them if it  would  be 
     O.K.to  allow  our members to use this  program,  they  said 
     "sure".(I have a letter on file).  So folks,  they have been 
     very  nice to us and let us not abuse their  kindness.  Read 
     the DOC for the details of how to test your Disk Drives  and 
     speak  kindly of those nice guys at Laboratory Microsystems. 
     (conditions  for  use= Do not alter to remove  the  copyright 
     notice and do not resell,by any member,for profit).

2.   RAY PENLEY must have iron fingers. Look at this, his latest.
     He said it took over 50 hours to translate FORMAT from the
     UCSD version [had a few logical errors in the original prgm].
     This is from the book SOFTTOOLS by K & F.  It is also avail
     from the 'BDS-C Users Group' in 'C' of course!  For those of
     you who can not  afford  a  $500  Wordstar or even  a  $150
     Tex Formatter this is just the thing.  You'll have complete
     control over the way your documents are printed.  You must
     have Pascal/Z vers 3.3 or later for this one!

3.    A  member called me from Denver and wanted to know what  he 
     could  for us.   So I sent him a copy of this  UCSD  program 
     ahead of time.  As a club or group, we should at least have 
     a standard way of printing our programs. So whenever or who
     ever gets this Pretty-Printer converted I will offer it to 
     the group and ask that EVERYONE use it. It'll be our firstŠ     group standard. I'll be asking Ithaca to ship it with their
     future software as well.
