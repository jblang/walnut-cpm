  2.36 (Standard 8" to Double Density, Double Sided operation)
CDOSFMAP.* The FMAP utility from CPMUG Vol 8 modified  to 
    reflect the changes in Vol 40 and to accomodate the 512 
    directory entries possible with CDOS
CDOSUCAT.* The UCAT utility from CPMUG modified to reflect the 
    updates in Vol 40 and to accept wildcard ignore names of 
    the form ????????.SYM, etc

These programs are public domain because: 
They are updates of earlier CPMUG releases which have been 
altered by the author.


To whom would this program be useful: 
All users of CDOS versions 2.17 to 2.36


Briefly describe the program function: 
CDOSFMAP.*
CDOSUCAT.*
These programs allow use of the Master Disk Catalogue scheme 
with CDOS 2.17 to 2.36. (The original CAT.COM is still OK).

CDOSCOPY.*
Operates as per earlier CPMUG release for 8" S/D disks.
For Double Density or Double sided disks a 'Read/Write Logical 
Block' approach is used to copy the disk. Although not yet used 
with 5" disks the modification is simple.

CDOSSAP.*
the SAP utility from the CPMUG rewritten for CDOS to reflect 
differences in handling:
Disks other than Single density Single Sided,
The CDOS disk label
CDOS file protect attributes.
