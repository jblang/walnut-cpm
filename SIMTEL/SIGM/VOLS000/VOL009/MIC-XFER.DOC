		INSTALLATION AND USE OF MIC-XFER PROGRAM
		------------ --- --- -- -------- -------

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS:

IN ORDER TO USER MIC-XFER, THE FOLLOWING MINIMUM CONFIGURATION IS REQUIRED:

	1. IBM-FORMAT CP/M SYSTEM CONFIGURED FOR AT LEAST 28K.
	2. MICROPOLIS CP/M SYSTEM CONFIGURED FOR 17K.
	3. THE SOURCE FILE 'MIC-XFER.ASM' (PROVIDED ON THIS DISK).
	4. THE ABILITY FOR #1 AND #2 TO RESIDE IN THE SAME BUS AT
		THE SAME TIME WITHOUT ANY HARDWARE CONFLICTS.
	5. THE MICROPOLIS CONTROLLER ADDRESS (BOOTSTRAP ADDRESS) MUST BE
		KNOWN.  (THIS MAY BE DETERMINED BY INSPECTING THE ADDRESS
		JUMPERS ON THE MICROPOLIS CONTROLLER BOARD, AND INTERPRETING
		THEM ACCORDING TO THE MICROPOLIS MANUAL).
	6. THE ADDRESS OF THE IBM-FORMAT CP/M WARM START VECTOR MUST BE
		KNOWN.  (THIS MAY BE DETERMINED BY EXAMINING LOCATIONS
		1 AND 2 IN MEMORY WHILE THE IBM-FORMAT SYSTEM IS RUNNING).

THE FIRST STEP IN GENERATING MIC-XFER FOR YOUR SYSTEM IS TO GET A COPY OF
YOUR 17K MICROPOLIS SYSTEM IMAGE ONTO AN IBM-FORMAT DISK.  THIS MAY BE DONE
AS FOLLOWS:

	1. BOOT THE IBM-FORMAT SYSTEM.
	2. TRANSFER CONTROL TO THE MICROPOLIS SYSTEM BY TYPING:
		A>DDT
		DDT VERS 1.4
		-G<MICROPOLIS BOOT ADDRESS>
	   THE MICROPOLIS SYSTEM WILL BOOT UP AND SIGN ON.
	3. CREATE A SYSTEM IMAGE FILE BY TYPING:
		A>SYSGEN
		SYSGEN VERS 1.4
		SOURCE DRIVE NAME (OR RETURN TO SKIP) A
		FUNCTION COMPLETE
		DESTINATION DRIVE NAME (OR RETURN TO REBOOT) <RETURN>
		A>SAVE 36 MIC17.COM
	4. TRANSFER MIC17.COM TO THE IBM-FORMAT SYSTEM BY TYPING (FROM THE
	    MICROPOLIS SYSTEM):
		A>DDT MIC17.COM
		DDT VERS 1.4
		NEXT PC
		2500 0100
		-G<IBM-FORMAT WARM START ADDRESS>
	   THE IBM-FORMAT SYSTEM SHOULD WARM-BOOT AND PROMPT.  TYPE:
		A>SAVE 36 MIC17.COM

NOW THAT YOU HAVE A COPY OF YOUR MICROPOLIS CP/M ON AN IBM-FORMAT DISK, YOU
MUST CUSTOMIZE MIC-XFER.ASM FOR YOUR MICROPOLIS CONTROLLER, AND THEN ASSEMBLE
IT AND COMBINE IT WITH MIC17.COM.  THIS IS DONE AS FOLLOWS:

	1. DETERMINE THE CORRECT VALUE FOR THE SYMBOL 'MCTL' IN MIC-XFER.
	   THIS MAY BE CALCULATED BY ADDING 200H TO THE MICROPOLIS BOOT
	   ADDRESS.  FOR EXAMPLE, IF YOUR MICROPOLIS BOOT ADDRESS IS F800,
	   THEN THE CORRECT VALUE OF 'MCTL' IS FA00.
	2. EDIT THE CORRECT VALUE OF 'MCTL' FOR YOUR SYSTEM INTO MIC-XFER.ASM.
	   THE 'EQU' FOR 'MCTL' MAY BE FOUND ON LINE 6.
	3. WHILE YOU ARE IN THE EDITOR, YOU MAY WANT TO COMMENT OUT THE 'TITLE'
	   STATEMENT IN LINE 1.  IF YOU ASSEMBLE MIC-XFER USING 'ASM', THIS
	   LINE WILL PRODUCE AN ERROR, BUT THE CORRECT CODE WILL STILL BE
	   GENERATED.  IF YOU ASSEMBLE MIC-XFER USING 'MAC', THE 'TITLE'
	   STATEMENT WILL BE ACCEPTED PROPERLY, AND NEED NOT BE COMMENTED OUT.
	4. USING EITHER 'ASM' OR 'MAC', ASSEMBLE MIC-XFER TO PRODUCE THE
	   OBJECT FILE 'MIC-XFER.HEX'.
	5. MERGE MIC-XFER.HEX WITH MIC17.COM BY TYPING:
		A>DDT MIC17.COM
		DDT VERS 1.4
		NEXT PC
		2500 0100
		-IMIC-XFER.HEX
		-R
		-G0
		A>SAVE 36 MIC-XFER.COM
	   THIS COMPLETES INSTALLATION OF MIC-XFER IN YOUR SYSTEM.

USING MIC-XFER:

MIC-XFER WILL TRANSFER ONE OR MORE FILES BETWEEN AN IBM-FORMAT CP/M SYSTEM AND
A MICROPOLIS CP/M SYSTEM.  THE SOURCE DRIVE, DESTINATION DRIVE, AND DIRECTION
OF TRANSFER MAY BE SPECIFIED IN THE COMMAND LINE.  THE CP/M WILDCARDS '?' AND
'*' ARE FULLY IMPLEMENTED, MAKING MULTIPLE FILES OR EVEN WHOLE-DISK TRANSFERS
VERY EASY.  MIC-XFER IS EXECUTED BY TYPING:
	A>MIC-XFER S:FFFFFFFF.TTT D:X
		WHERE:
			S	  IS THE SOURCE DRIVE
			FFFFFFFF  IS THE AMBIGUOUS OR NON-AMBIGUOUS FILENAME
			TTT	  IS THE AMBIGUOUS OR NON-AMBIGUOUS FILETYPE
			D	  IS THE DESTINATION DRIVE
			X	  IS THE DESTINATION SYSTEM - I=IBM-FORMAT
							      M=MICROPOLIS
FOR EXAMPLE, TO TRANSFER ALL '.COM' FILES ON IBM-FORMAT DRIVE B TO MICROPOLIS
DRIVE A, YOU WOULD TYPE:
	A>MIC-XFER B:*.COM A:M

WHILE EXECUTING, MIC-XFER WILL REPORT EACH FILENAME AS IT IS TRANSFERRED,
AS WELL AS ANY ERRORS WHICH MAY OCCUR.  AN ERROR ON ONE FILE OF A MULTI-
FILE TRANSFER WILL NOT ABORT THE TRANSFER OF THE REMAINING FILES.  EXECUTION
MAY BE INTERRUPTED BY STRIKING CONTROL-C, WHICH WILL BE RECOGNIZED AT THE
COMPLETION OF THE CURRENT FILE TRANSFER.
