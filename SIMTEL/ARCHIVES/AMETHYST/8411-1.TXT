Larry -- MotU still distributes Mince.  It has stopped distributing
Scribble.

You would almost certainly be better off with The FinalWord, because the
keys can be rebound to look like Mince by the user.

Scribble distribution was halted because of source code update problems,
keeping users current, and a complete re-write which was done two years
ago.

The current version of The FinalWord for CP/M systems is 1.15.  The
current version of Mince is still 2.6.  The current version of Scribble
is 1.4, although I hope you can't find anybody selling it anymore.  I
believe that CMU still sells it via a distribution license through their
Comp.Ctr.
