A version of Mince 2.6 runs just fine on the IBM with monochrome display.

And this time it's really totally free of assembler!  (We'll be putting
some in to do searches when we get a chance -- the compiler is a little
flakey right now, so we aren't going to put in the effort just yet.  For
the same reason, no source code is available now either, because of all
the programming-around-compiler-bugs that was done.)
