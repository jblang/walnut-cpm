and other questions..

anyone know how much a MINCE source license costs?  also, anyone have any
experience in adapting the MINCE system to serve as the editor within other 
programs (e.g., I have a lot of WP to do, but I want to do it within
another program.)

tnx...

You've probably got all the answers you need/want, but...  you normally get
full source code when you but mince (well, 80% of the code) and are free to
do what you want except make a profit from it.  contact mark of the
unicorn folks -- i know they've had a problem getting ibm-pc sources out
at first...

Was talking to a Unicorn marker who showed up at work today.
There is evidently a brand-new FW version which implements
(tah dah!) control-K! Just though you might like to know.
He also stated that multi-font (fixed and variable width)
capabilties will have to wait for the next major release.

I'm writing a routine to read a directory into a buffer and have a couple
questions about Mince internals:

1.  If I set the DMA address to some random location, will it be set
to something valid when Mince attempts to do I/O?  Experiments seem to
indicate yes.  I use my own DMA buffer (not 80H) to be safe in case
the buffer routines start swapping while I'm creating the directory
buffer.

2.  Can I set the modified flag to false after writing to it?  It would
be nice to have Mince think that the directory buffer was never changed
(avoiding the flush changed buffers questin on ^X^C).

Anybody interested in the routine?

can someone give me a one paragraph overview of how one can string together
different mince commands into one "macro" command?  than I can hack the
manual.

tnx.

Yes, I would be interested in such a thing.

Subject: MINCE macro commands
From: bridger@rand-unix

	A "keystroke macro" facility can be added to mince by intercepting
the routine that retrieves input from the keyboard input queue and
diverting it to read from a queue containing the macro.  To make this
repeatable (with ^U) requires careful attention to the mince console-status
routine also.

	I've been working on a different approach that's now being tested
on the KayPro--adding a shellto CP/M that supports downloadable strings
for the keypad/function keys that are redefinable within the user program.  
This feature, optionally bound
to BeginMacro/EndMacro commands added to the editor, works nicely and
gives the editor a "stored macro" capability--definitions can be saved
and reloaded for specific editing tasks.

Because it's in the shell,  this keystroke macro capability is available for
any program.

hmmmm.  i should have thought of that.  in fact, the config file should help
be able to help with the downloading of programmed function keys.
