Does anyone know if there is a version of MINCE which runs on a Z-100 under
either CP/M-86 (preferable) or Z-DOS (MS-DOS)?   I know I can run the 8-bit
version under either CP/M-85 or CP/M-86 but I am looking for a 16-bit version.
If no such version exists, is there enough provided with other versions to
make such a version of MINCE.

Also, is the same amount of the partial source released as in the 8-bit
versions?  What C compiler is expected to be used?

I have tried to call Mark of the Unicorn and have gotten absolutely nowhere.
There does not seem to be anyone who can be reached by phone who knows
anything.

Truly suggest you use CP/M-80 version.  However, if you want
to re-program it, you can get the IBM P.C. version, which won't
run on your machine, but will be on disks you can read, rewrite
TERM.C, and compile/link it with Lattice C.  The source code
files are the same, although I think that MotU no longer gives
the utility source code out (DIFF.C and (?)others).

The reason you are finding it hard to get answers on the phone
with MotU is that it is becoming more of a consumer products
company and less of a hacker tools company.  I believe this to
be a good sign, not a bad one.  And I will try to answer any
questions of a technical nature which you may have, here.

Brian,
I caught a message of yours about Mince and since I've had nothing but
exasperation getting anything technical out of M of the U, I thought I'd
give you (and the rest of the group) a try.

I've tried to link Mince 2.6 (using the L2 submit supplied that includes
the new VBUFF3) and the resulting module just hangs.  I've made no source
changes as yet, so I'm a bit discouraged.  Any advice?

I'm running under CP/M-80 on a Heath 89.

Thanks,
Leon Traister (LMTRA@SRI-KL)

The usual flake is:  Is L2 going into 2-pass mode?  If so, you have two
choices: (1) Run your CP/M with a bigger TPA so it only takes one pass,
or (2) Change your L2 line so that it reads:

l2 mince bndings comm1 comm2 comm3 vbuff1 vbuff3 vbuff2 -l support aterm
term util

i.e., move the "aterm" to the right-hand side of the "-l".

what used to be happening is that L2 found duplicate symbols in term and
aterm on its first pass, choose one of the files to use them from
(aterm, since it passed across it first), but then the second pass never
knew where the routine really came from, so it just took whatever it
could get, sometimes from the second one, and if they were different
sizes, it got all messed up.

Any chance for a Mince "3.0" - with all the neat features of FW, the
supposed bug fixes in PW and its successors, etc.?  I sure could use
more buffers and more marks, and *especially* the capability of
returning to the complete set of buffers for a faster
edit/compile/debug cycle.  I could live without sources...

FW may be nice, but it's the one more editor to learn that's past my
ability to cope... i.e., I'd rather switch between EMACS and MINCE
than EMACS and FW...

--Frank

P.S. Should we really all be using L2 2.2.4 that comes with BDS-C 1.50a?

Hope Bill Pearson's offer solves your dilemma.  Thanks, Bill.  If
Westico doesn't have the source code, I'm sure MotU will give it to you
for mailing them a blank disk and a photocopy of your Westico
distribution disk.

The usual things people recommend for Mince-replacement are:
		The FinalWord
		PMATE
		VEDIT
 All have semi-customizable keyboard interfaces, none is entirely
satisfactory EMACS when you're all done (FW mis-implements a few
functions, as does VEDIT, and you can write your own macros with PMATE
but it runs slowly if you macro-ize every single key to work like EMACS,
not to mention that the PMATE 2-window macro is a vile hack), and all
run on CP/M-86.

Herb --
 I'm sorry to say that MotU does not offer the FX80 drivers.  You need
more than just SCONFIG-ing; you'll have to write a printer driver for
inclusion in CRAYON.  The current Crayon doesn't understand how to
microspace on the FX-80, which is necessary if you want to place a PS
character so that its right edge is at the right margin of justified
text.  (BTW, you'd be surprised at how many people don't understand the
previous sentence and what it really means.  Took me about a minute to
see the obvious...)  If you don't care about justification, go ahead and
enter the width table (I can supply you with that, or you can figure it
out pretty easily) and change the init string to put the FX-80 in PS
mode.  Given the width table, Scribble is able to do filling OK with
@Style(Justification=No).  As I recall, Crayon does do microfeeding on
Epsons, but not microspacing.

thanks.  What I really need is the micro-feed part (actually, all I

Still, if it is easy for you to contribute the width table, I wouldn't

I will post the width table.  Oh, dear.  I seem to have said that the
Crayon driver for Epsons did microfeeding.  Oops.  I thought it did.
Well, just in case it doesn't, or you need to know this hack for another
printer, here goes:

To get half-line-feeding on a hackish basis, just do three things: (1)
Insert a sequence into the Init string which sets the default line feed
distance on the Epson printer to 1/2 line.  (2) Put an @Style[spacing 2
lines] into your .MSS file (3) Use an @verbatim whenever you need
superscripts.

Alas, this isn't universally useful, e.g. it doesn't help out footnotes
or anything, and can cause other grief.  But a math professor told me
that was how he did equation formatting with it, so he could do
on-screen equation layout and end up with super/sub equations without
interspersing a lot of @+/@- commands into his neatly-lined-up text.

You didn't. your msg talked about microspacing.  So i take it that
CRAYON doesn't recognize commands for half space (which I presume is
what @+ and @- use)?  would it be possible to use verbatim mode and
set the style parameter to say @style(spacing n micas) for n = 1/2
line and put the style command just before the verbatim command?


tnx.

Mea culpa!!  I'm really sorry about the obnoxious overtones in my last
message to you.  In re-reading my message, I can see how it might have
sounded crass.  To clarify (I hope), your message to which I responded
said that you thought you had mentioned microfeeding; my "You didn't"
was referring to that part of your message, not to your posting the
width table.

I for one would like you to know that I very much appreciate the time

Took a long time to answer, but...

The wizard of Mince tells me that yes, if you set the DMA address to
something random, it will be valid when Mince attempts to do I/O.  And
that you have chosen the only way to get Dired to work.  However, he
says "if you must" to your question about setting the modified flag to
false after writing to the buffer.  Being a purist, he feels that the
changes to the directory should not be made until you exit from Dired
mode, which should delete the buffer so that the question about modified
buffers on exiting Mince would never appear.  (Of course, when
confronted with the fact that it's a drag keeping around the information
until Dired is exited and that The FinalWord doesn't even go to such
great lengths, he relented, but only in view that there is so little
free memory for storing linked lists of files to rename/delete or code
for reparsing the buffer to catch all the deleted files upon exiting
Dired.)

I hope that somebody said that they were interested in the routine;
someone once asked for such a thing about a year ago.

Thanks to Brian Hess for answering my questions.  A while ago, I asked
about interest in Dired routines for mince.  I wrote a minimal routine
that reads the directory into a buffer and does no more.  I didn't have
the time or interest in writing a more complete Dired (I'm also not
convinced its worth the memory either).  The following is the routine I
wrote.  If anyone decides to modify it, please tell me.

/* DIRED.C - A directory reader.  This really shouldn't be called dired,
since it just reads in a directory buffer.  I suppose it can be viewed
as the beginning of a dired mode.

If you bind this routine to ^X^D it will read in the directory of the
current disk.  Binding to anything else will cause it to prompt for disk.
I have it bound to ^X^D and ^XD.
