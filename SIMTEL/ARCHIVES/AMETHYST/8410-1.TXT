A friend just called them and was told that they have quit distributing
Mince and Scribble.  He is looking for a copy to buy - does anyone know
of a distributor that still has them in stock?  The stated reason for
stopping distribution is that "no one is interested in them anymore".
How can we convince MotU of the idiocy of this idea?  For a program that
hasn't been advertised in a couple of years, I was under the impression
that it sold rather well.  Anyway, I would really appreciate pointers to
sources for Mince and Scribble - my fried can accept a variety of formats,
including standard 8" single sided.
