Subject: Mince keyboard macros

   A major feature of Emacs that is missing in Mince is keyboard macros.
Since I tend to use them a lot, I finally got sufficiently frustrated with
Mince that I added the feature.  If you would like the sources for the
modifications (they're not that long), I would be glad to send you a copy.

   It seems to me that it should not be too hard to add in overlays and
restarting with old swap file contents and other things.  All I would need
is a complete set of sources to Mince and a couple of days of work.  Anyone
at MOTU listening?

I have put the sources for my mince keyboard macros in MIT-MC:FJW;MMODS
TXT.  They will be there until FJW moves the file over to the Simtel20.  If
you have any problems with it, don't hesitate to let me know.
