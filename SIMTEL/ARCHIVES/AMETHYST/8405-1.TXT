I recently converted my H89 to CP/M 3.0 (banked).  Most of my CP/M 2.2
software continued to work, but I've had some trouble with MINCE.  The
.COM file I made a couple of years ago mostly worked, but occasionally
exhibited odd behavior such as altering the definition of a "word",
such that word-motion and word-deletion commands would suddenly begin
operating on an entire line.

I recompiled everything with my v1.44 BDS `C', and the above behavior
went away, but instead MINCE now seems incapable of displaying certain
prompts (such as "Abandon modified buffers?").  My attempts to make a
v1.2 L2 from the sources on SIMTEL20 have also failed.  The resulting
L2 simply announces there are too many functions and exits *before
processing any files*.

Does anyone know what's going on here, or how I might go about finding
out?  Would upgrading my admittedly ancient version of BDS `C' help?

On a related topic, has anyone modified the BDS library to take
advantage of some of the features of CP/M 3?  For example, the I/O
functions could trap BDOS errors rather than allowing the program to be
blown away, the built-in filename parsing could be used (thus passwords
could be supported), the UNIX stat, time, and stime calls could be
supported, as well as certain terminal ioctls, etc.  Something tells me
that this sort of thing has been done somewhere, but I haven't done any
CP/M hacking for several years now, so please forgive my ignorance.

I'll be happy to summarize replies if there is any interest.

The problem with certain messages not appearing may be due to the two
ways messages are displayed under MINCE. Some stuff is sent out directly
through BIOS calls, while some stuff is written using standard C printf.
Some versions of printf (for example, the one under Unix) don't send out
that stuff until they see a linefeed, so if you only send prompts without
linefeeds it will never see the light of day.
