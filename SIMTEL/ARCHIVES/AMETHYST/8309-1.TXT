actually, i'm not thinking of a keyboard macro.  i'm just thinking of
say adding a command , e.g., c-I, which will simply be the sequence 
C-U C-U C-F.  the question is, how can i modify the source that i do have
to add this command.  (as i said, it was a dumb question).

Every so often MINCE gets a BIOS I/O error and drops back to CP/M, and I lose
whatever had been typed (very painful).  The information is on the swap file,
but the instructions don't tell how to get it back.  Is there a trick that
will allow a restart with the text from the swap file?

Or is there a modification that can be made with the source that comes with
MINCE that will allow graceful recovery from I/O errors?  The problem is that
the DEC Rainbow I use has a mechanical switch that senses the write protect
slot and occasionally it tells lies (it is on a chincy tab of metal that
catches on the slot as you pull out the disk and bends - a real bear to fix,
so I don't until it lies all the time).  You MINCE along swapping nicely, then
at the worst moment the BIOS thinks the disk is read only and you notice that
the last few words you type is to a A> prompt, and a "BIOS Error, Disk A R/O"
message showing.  I don't know why DEC doesn't know about LED's and photo
diodes, or why they sense that damn switch continuously.

anyone know how to patch CRAYON so that a ^-D will detach it while
running under MPM 8-16?  (^-D is the standard control character for
detach).

tnx.

I've just started with MINCE and would like to be on AMETHYST bulletin 
distribution.

I would also like to define keys for my H/Z-89 so that it will be as close
as possible to the EMACS keys that I have defined on my office H19.  Does 
anyone have any hints or examples?  They would be helpful...

Thanks,
