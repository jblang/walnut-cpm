Has anybody written a hack to read the directory of a disk into a mince
buffer?  I don't even care if its sorted...just something small, quick
and dirty.

If anyone has such hacked sources I would be glad to store them in INFO-IBMPC
if such is alright with the MOTU folks. Just don't expect any patience with
any special hacks unique to CPM or non 8086/8 processors.

What?  You mean c-X c-D does NOT create a directory buffer?
What a loss!  By the way, someone once sent me a pointer to
a hacked-up Mince which supported c-m-F and related commands
that understand parentheses and other programming syntax,
but I lost the pointer.  Where can I get such a Mince?

C-x C-d is just list directory in EMACS; it quickly displays the
directory.  C-x D is DIRED, the full editor (which I don't have in my
admittedly old version).

I agree.
