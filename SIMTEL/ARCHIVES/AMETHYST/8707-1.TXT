Subject: Widely used tools on various hosts
Date: Wed, 01 Jul 87 11:38:49 -0400
From: howell%community-chest.mitre.org@gateway.mitre.org

I am interested in information on widely used tools that are
available on a variety of hosts.  For example, EMACS-based editors
are available for a wide range of UNIX hosts, for micros running
MS/DOS, and I believe for VAX VMS.  Scribe is also available for
several different operating systems.  What other machines/OSes does
Scribe or EMACS run on?  What are other examples of tools that run on
various operating systems?  I imagine there are a number of examples
from the microcomputer world (e.g. Lotus on a variety of OSes).
I'm interested in a wide definition of "tools"; for example, I
would consider the availability of TCP/IP on UNIX and VMS, or the
availability of NFS on UNIX and PCs, to be good examples.

Please send to me; I'm not on all of the lists I've mailed to.
I'll summarize all responses received by 10 July and redistribute 
to all mailing lists.

Thanks,

Chuck Howell
