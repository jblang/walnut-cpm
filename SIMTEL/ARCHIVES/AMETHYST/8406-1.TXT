We use BDS C 1.5 and L2 1.3 internally; I'll check with L2's author to
see if 1.3 is distributed, and if so or not, why so or not...  You can
use 1.45 or 1.45a to compile your old source code, andif you want to use
1.5, you can get an update from Mark of the Unicorn for your old disk
and $25.

Mince's author says that the distributed Mince works properly under CP/M
3.0, and can't think of any good things that might be wrong to cause
intermittent deviation in some COMMn.C routines.

He also said that on CP/M, the printf does indeed send stuff out right
away, and that TERM.C doesn't use printf (at least not the standard
large version) anyway; therefore, that can't be the problem with some
messages not appearing.
