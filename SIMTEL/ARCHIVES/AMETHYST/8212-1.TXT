Subject:  Hack/patch Wanted!
To: AMETHYST-USERS at MIT-MC

Anybody have a patch to MINCE 2.6 that will allow it to find and use
the MINCE.SWP file located in A0: while you're in some other User
area?  I know I can try using DUPUSR2 to copy the directory entries to
all the User areas I use, but that tends to destroy the directory
rather quickly.  PIPing copies is not feasible - no room...

Any ideas?

the easiest (and poerhaps most kludgy way) is to load up
DU, and duplicate the entry for mince.swp. just changes the
user number (the first byte) to whatever user number that you want
the swap file to show up in.

There's a program called dupuser which does it for you.

Does anybody have any code modifying mince to edit C code?  I'd write some
if only I knew how to hack mince, and do it for LISP too while I was at it.

Please add me to you list of mince/scribble users and to any
applicable mailing lists.  Thank you.  Also, I am having a certain
amount of trouble getting mince and scribble to run.  If there is a
patient person who wouldn't mind listening to my ravings,would you
have this person contact me?

He's been added - now, can anyone volunteer to help?  If so, please
contact JURGEN@MC directly.

Subject:  Final Word vs. Perfect Writer vs. Mince 2.6
To: AMETHYST-USERS at MIT-MC

Is there any user of all three or any two of the subject products
willing to give us a comparison of these products?  I'm looking to
find out not so much as what they do the same (as compared to MINCE
2.6 as a base), but what they do different.

I would also prefer that the principals, who may be listening, NOT
reply unless there is either a gross piece of misinformation or
misunderstanding involved, and only then when all user replies appear
to have come in.

Thanks,
Frank

Did you get any bits on this?  What prompted the question?

Still wading thru accumulated mail...  What prompted the question is
that I use Mince 2.6 exclusively for writing a very large program
(which I have conveniently broken into reasonable chunks), and we
recently received the other two which I have yet to install or even
read the manuals.  Since it doesn't appear that there will be a Mince
2.7 (or 3.0 or 4.0 or whatever), I really wanted to know if I should
jump to one of the other two, or simply be content with what I have
(and maybe take the plunge and start incorporating some of those
changes others have made, and, eventually, a few of my own)...
