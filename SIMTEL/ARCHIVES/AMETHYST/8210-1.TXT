	As an avid user of mince on CPM, and having gotten a Zenith 8/16
bit machine, I would like to join the mailing list and also learn about
the availability of MINCE for MS-DOS.  I need to be able to customize
MINCE, so I am also curious about the C-compiler used.

The current version of Mince is probably not yet quite what you want...
   There is a DOS version, which uses the Lattice C compiler.
   However, there is no source code out yet, and the version that is 
   available has been customized for the IBM P.C. display.  Soon, there
   will be CP/M-86 and generalized MSDOS versions, we hope...  Or at least
   source code so that you can remove the IBM terminal driver and insert yours.

Mince is available for the IBM PC.  We need to know a couple of things
about the Zenith before we can make a version for it:

 -- are the screen control codes the same as an H-19?  If not, what
    are they?

 -- does it read IBM PC disks?

We use the Lattice C compiler from Lifeboat.  Expensive ($500) but a
very good compiler.

Do you have the newsletters published by the Amethyst Users Group (when it
existed)?  I'm looking for a copy of them.  (I'm not speaking of the
Amethyst-Users archives on MC.)  Thanks.  --Jim

	Dear Father Celoni,
			The AUG users group disk is in AR0:JCAF; on MIT-MC
if that is a help.
