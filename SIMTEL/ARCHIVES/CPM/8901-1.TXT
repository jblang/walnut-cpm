Subject: MEX 1.14 fixes uploaded to SIMTEL20

Now available from SIMTEL20 via standard anonymous FTP:

Filename			Type	 Bytes	 CRC

Directory PD2:<CPM.MEX>
MEX114FX.LBR			BINARY	  2816  FC00H

Here is the author's short doc file:

     This library contains a patch that fixes several
longstanding bugs in MEX V1.14.  The patch does not add any new
features;  the idea was to fix a few things that never quite
worked as documented, and to fix the CompuServe "A" protocol
which stopped working when ComuServe made changes to its
software.  Since the program's author no longer seems to be
interested in updating this free program, I decided to fix what I
could by patching.  Please note, however, that MEX is a
copyrighted program and as such should not be distributed with
this patch installed.


                             WARNING

               In order to make room in the
               program for these fixes, it was
               necessary to use some Z80-specific
               instructions.  Once this patch file
               has been installed, MEX will no
               longer run on an 8080 or 8085
               processor.  If your system does not
               have a Z80 or Z80 compatible CPU,
               DO NOT INSTALL THIS PATCH!


     Installing the patch will cause the following changes in
MEX:

     1.  CompuServe "A" protocol now works correctly.  Also fixed
         are the long delays that used to occur if a capture file
         was open when a CopuServe transfer was begun.

     2.  The "/N" symbol, which represents a carriage return/line
         feed pair, now works correctly in key strings and
         SENDOUT commands.

     3.  Key strings containing a slash character can now be
         saved and loaded correctly.

     4.  If GLOBAL T is in effect and an XMODEM download is
         aborted to terminal mode because of too many errors or
         timeouts, the system no longer crashes the next time
         terminal mode is exited.

     5.  The TERM command has been made more reliable.  Under
         certain circumstances it could cause a sytem to lock up.

     6.  MEX now signs on as version 1.14C.


     Use MLOAD.COM, available from most RCP/M systems, to install
the patches into MEX.  Assuming that all necessary files are on
the current directory, that you want to keep your original
version, and that you will call the new version MEX114C.COM, the
command would be:
     MLOAD MEX114C=MEX.COM,MEX114FX.HEX

Simtel20 is a DEC20 running TOPS20 ???. The directory structure
is a little strange, and binary files have to be transfrred in the
tenex mode to get around the 36 bit word length on Simtel20.
It can be a little slow ( my U of R. connections come out about
500 characters/sec, compared to UR<->Cornell ftp rates of 20-50
kbytes! However, it's a great resource.

Subject: Accessing the modem on a C 128 in CP/M mode

I have a C128, and a CP/M terminal program. I want to configure the
terminal program to talk to the modem (1670) attached to my 128. Does
anyone have ANY ideas at all as to how to do this. The following
are necessary:

MODEM input status  : how can I tell if a character is ready to read
MODEM input	    : how do I get a character from the modem once the
		      routine above has told me it's ready
MODEM output status : how do I tell if the modem is able to accept
		      another character
MODEM output        : how do I give a character to the modem once I know
		      it can take one.

I'll take any suggestions at all - If you have MODEM740 or IMP (or MEX
or anything) running I'll take that. I'm looking for any ideas at all.

Other optional things that would be nice are:

BREAK : how do I start and stop a break condition on the modem
DTR   : how do I enable and disable DTR (this is used to hang up the modem)
BAUD  : how do I change the baud rate (1200 / 300 selection will be enough
	or even just 1200 alone)
MODE  : how do I change the communications mode (# data bits, # stop bits
	parity etc.)

Please E-mail me with responses, I'll forward anything I get to anyone that
asks. Also please E-mail to the address below, rather than to where this
article came from.

	Thanks in advance,

Subject: MEX Plus EXEC function

 
I have come across a MEXPlus command which does not seem to be documented. 
This is the EXEC command.  I wondered whether it was a synonym for READ, but 
this is not the case. 
 
Using EXEC by itself produces a response "File not found" and adding a file
and adding a file name (I used a .MEX file) produces the response "File 
xxx.COD not found.
 
Does anyone know what the EXEC function in MEXPlus is for ?
 
                             Happy New Year!

Does anyone have a CP/M version of Turbo Pascal that they no longer use?
I am interested in buying outright, with manuals and licencing agreement,
not pirating.  (Borland is one of the Good Sam companies I refuse to
rip off).  No one, including Borland, seems to be selling it anymore,
though, so if you're willing to part with it, you can sort of name
your price.  I will be very grateful.

Ed Schramm (sir-alan!eds@vax.cs.pittsburgh.edu) ported XINU to CP/M some time
ago.  He tried to post it to Royal Oak, but that did not work for obvious
reasons.  I will make it available for downloading/anonymous uucp access on
my system, plus what I have collected of the UZI files.  Look in either the
"cp-m" download area of the UNaXcess BBS or in /usr/spool/uucppublic/cp-m.
Anonymous uucp login is "uucp", no password; use "bbs" for the BBS.

(XINU availability depends upon Comer releasing it for public access; I have
no idea what the current status of XINU is.)

Subject: redirection of output

I assume the question was to redirect output from an existing
application program for which no source code was available, to
a disk file. If you wanted to capture incomming stuff off the 
serial ports, KERMIT might be more convenient than PIP.
CP/M does not treat IO devices the same as files like
UNIX, so one can not easily ( with out hacking your bios,
) capture IO into files. I can imagine a small utility
sitting under CCP capturing calls to RDR or whatever,
and writting a log file. However, many CP/M programs using serial
ports go directly to the hardware, so there is still a
problem. Can you be more specific as to the capability needed?

Subject: "The Computer Journal" Subscription Information

There have been a number of requests for more information about
subscriptions to The Computer Journal.  I finally remembered to bring in one
of their flyers.  Here are the subscription rates (a one-year subscription
is six issues):
 
                  US            Canada                 Foreign
                                                Surface          Air
 
  1 Year        $16.00          $22.00          $24.00         ($38.00)
 
  2 Year        $28.00          $42.00
 
  Back Issues   $ 3.50 ea       $ 3.50 ea       $ 4.75 ea
   six or more  $ 3.00 ea       $ 3.00 ea       $ 4.25 ea
 
Prices probably could be quoted for the missing columns in the table if
anyone needs the information.  The foreign-air rate is not in the TCJ flyer
but is my recollection of the figure Art Carlson told me ($14 extra for air
mail).
 
The two-year Canada figure does not seem quite right to me.  If the
surcharge is $6 on a one-year subscription, then a $12 surcharge on two
years would give a figure of $40 (28+12).  Similarly, the two-year foreign
surface subscription would be $44 (28+2*8) and air subscription, $72
(28+2*22).
 
Checks, VISA, and MasterCard are accepted.  Subscriptions should be sent to:

              ADDITIONAL ANNOUNCEMENTS and ANSWERs to COMMON QUESTIONS 
                   REGARDING PC PURSUIT PRICE CHANGE ANNOUNCEMENT.
 
 
          To ALL PC Pursuit customers:
 
          There  has  been  an  overwhelming  response  to the recent price
          change announcement/letter  (see related  bulletin).   So much so
          that my  personally responding  to EACH  in a timely manner is an
          impossibility.  However, we  are  reading  all  the  mail.   This
          bulletin  contains  some  related  new  announcements, as well as
          answers to common concerns.
 
          First, the following announcements:
 
          1.   WE HAVE DECIDED TO WAIVE THE  LIMITATION OF  ONE ACCOUNT PER
               PERSON.   There is  now NO LIMIT to the number of PC Pursuit
               accounts that  can  be  ordered/owned  by  a  single person.
               Thus, if  you have  determined that  a 60 hour usage cap (or
               90, or  any multiple  of 30  hours) is  more appropriate for
               your typical  usage, you can order the appropriate number of
               accounts.
 
          2.   In order  to provide  you with  plenty of  time to determine
               what your  requirements are, WE HAVE DECIDED NOT TO BILL YOU
               FOR ANY OVER CAP USAGE UNTIL MAY 1, 1989.  The fixed monthly
               charge will  still increase  to $30  as of February 1, 1989.
               However, you will not be billed for any non-prime time usage
               over 30 hours until the month of May 1989.  Please note that
               the actual statement for  May usage  won't appear  until mid
               June.
 
          3.   When  we  begin  billing  for  monthly  usage  over 30 hours
               (beginning with May's usage),  WE WILL  SUBTRACT THE AVERAGE
               TIME IT  TAKES TO CONNECT (APPROXIMATELY 1 MINUTE) FROM EACH
               CALL BEFORE ADDING UP THE TIME.  Therefore, you will  not be
               charged for a call to a BUSY line (as long as you disconnect
               the call immediately upon seeing the  "BUSY" message).   The
               exact  amount  of  time  to  be subtracted will be announced
               within the next few weeks.
 
 
          Addressing other common concerns:
 
          1.   Many people are suggesting  that it  is the  30 hour monthly
               usage  cap,  not  the  fixed  monthly increase to $30, which
               concerns  them  the  most.    Because  PC  Pursuit  must  be
               transformed to a profitable service to continue offering it,
               the primary alternative left  was  to  have  a  higher fixed
               monthly  price  with  a  higher  CAP (or a much higher fixed
               price  and  no  CAP).    Raising  the  fixed  monthly charge
               penalizes those  who use  the service  less than  30 hours a
               month (which is statistically the vast majority).  We do not
               believe that  the smaller  volume user  should subsidize the

 
 
 
 
               more serious  (higher volume)  user.   Thus, we  have the 30
               hour cap, which is appropriate for the new $30 fixed monthly
               charge.  To accommodate higher volume users, we  have waived
               the 1 account per user limitation (see above).

               Unfortunately,  some  cities  have  had  deployment  delays.

               is clearly missing since these copies show 7(c)  followed by
               7(e).    Unfortunately,  7(d)  states  our policy of 30 days
               notice for prices changes (or  other  changes).    Some have
               concluded  that  since  their  copy  of  the  Ts & Cs do not
               include this paragraph,  that  Telenet  can  not  change the
               pricing for  them.   I truly  apologize to those who have an
               erroneous   copy.      However,   the   law   clearly   (and
               appropriately)  provides  for  any  business  to  be able to
               change its pricing structure, and/or service offering in any
               way with  reasonable notice.  The Ts & Cs simply clarify our
               implementation  of  "reasonable  notice".    Lack   of  this
               paragraph does not remove the basic business right to change
               pricing (or other changes) with reasonable notice.
 
          Everyone here at Telenet wants to work with  our customers.   The
          announcements provided  here are  to accommodate  the concerns of
          many of you, and are a direct result of input received from you.
 
          I urge each of you to  take  advantage  of  the  next  few months
          (before  MAY)  to  determine  what  your  typical  monthly  usage
          actually is.  Our statistics clearly show that most of you should
          not be  effected by the 30 hour usage cap.  If you find that your

The extra slot can has all the Z-80 address lines as well as telling whether
it is in the ROM/video bank or in RAM.  There is also a nice 32k hole from
4000-BFFF in which to drop a RAM chip (or chips if you have bank selection
located there).

Of course, you have to have an operating system that can use it.

The Xerox manuals (generic ones) are awful.  You need the full up software
development guide(s).  Rather than bore everyone with all the details of
Xerox operation, I suggest you call my bulletin board: (213) 320-9309.  I
hardly get on there much myself (way too busy), but it is dedicated to 8-bit
CP/M (QP/M) stuff and has a strong Xerox group.  I remember several messages
I glossed over in just the past month about 820-II (16/8) manuals; did not
really read them, though...

Most of the comments received were public postings, so  I won't quote them
extensively.

Apparently, according to the collective wisdom of the net, there is no
formal mechanism for passing a pointer to the environment descriptor (ENV)
to a program written in an HLL.  Should such a mechanism exist?  More on
that latter.

Several different approaches were mentioned, some of which were generally
applicable to any language, and some of which were peculiar to bds-c.


I. Find the environment descriptor by searching memory for the identifying
string 'Z3ENV'.

  Marc Wilson (mwilson@crash.cts.com) in <3649@crash.cts.com> wrote:

  Both Jay Sage (SAGE@LL.ARPA) and Bridger Mitchell (bridger%rcc@RAND.ORG)
  pointed out that a simple memory search is not sufficient, since 'Z3ENV'
  could exist at other locations than the ENV, (named directory buffer,
  disk i/o buffers, etc).  They mentioned that if this technique is used,
  a check should be made to be sure the ENV address indicated by the
  search agrees with the self-contained address at ENV+1Bh.

  I used this technique several years ago for a few programs, but finally
  rejected it because it is not bulletproof.  As Marc Wilson mentioned,
  the search can produce very interesting results on any system with
  memory mapped i/o; that alone seems sufficient reason to reject it for
  any program meant for general distribution.


II. Write a module, perhaps ASM or a C structure, which mimics the z3env
header, then jumps to the runtime package entry point; link this module in
at the correct address.

  Several good folks from whom I received mail suggested this approach.
  The catch, of course, is linking such a module at the correct address.
  I don't see that one has that option.  I'm no authority on HLLs as run
  under cp/m, but since the final binary must start execution at 100h,
  would not a designer place the runtime package/initialization code at
  that address?


III. Compile and link in the usual way; hand patch the final binary by
moving the first few bytes (where the Z3 header goes) to the end of the
file, together with a mover routine.  Patch a Z3 header in the space thus
left at the beginning.  At run time, pick up the ENV pointer from the
header, store it at some fixed location, move the first few bytes back to
the beginning of the file, and jump to the beginning.

  This ingenious idea came from Bridger Mitchell (bridger%rcc@RAND.ORG).
  It is certainly generally applicable, not only to bds-c, but to any .COM
  file.  The only negative is the rather kludgy way in which the final
  binary must be put together, but even that could be automated, as
  Bridger points out, with a ZEX script.


IV. Incorporate a Z3 header in CCC.ASM, the source code for the bds-c
runtime package.  Assemble to a customized runtime package (C.CCC) to be
used with ZCPR.

  Andrew Scott Beals (bandy@well.UUCP) in <10150@well.UUCP> wrote:

  No, Andy, your eyes haven't been deceiving you!  And yes, I own a legal
  copy of bds-c!

  Andy's suggestion makes a lot of sense, though it is applicable to bds-c
  only, and is not a general solution to the problem of Zcpr/HLLs.  It was
  also my first tentative solution to the problem, before posting my
  inquiry.  It can perhaps be done, but it is not quite as simple as Andy
  suggests, and has a few disadvantages.

  According to the documentation (I haven't actually tried this, yet), and
  without going into excessive detail, that part of the standard library
  which is written in C would have to be recompiled, using a new standard
  header which accorded with the new C.CCC.  That part of the library
  written in assembly language would have to be reassembled, as most such
  functions reference absolute addresses in the runtime package.  So, now
  we have a second, non-standard set of libraries and a second,
  non-standard runtime package, different files with identical names, and
  we must remember to get the right pieces of the right package when we
  put it all together at 4:00 AM!

  Also, the linker (CLINK) plugs certain information into absolute
  addresses in C.CCC.  This can be worked around by using various linker
  options; unfortunately using those options deprives us of the
  possibility of using the -n (no warm boot) option, which allows the
  application to simply 'return' rather than warm booting.

  Nevertheless, this could work for bds-c.


Without getting into a debate on the side-issue of assembly language vs
high-level language programming for cp/m, a few thoughts come to mind.

Cp/m has come a long way since plain vanilla cp/m 2.2, and offers many
more advanced facilities.  The environment descriptor is fundamental to
making use of these facilities.  If we were designing the operating system
from scratch, no doubt the environment descriptor address would be
available from a system call.

This could not be done when we had only the Digital Research bdos.  Now,
however, we have a whole new generation of bdos replacements being used in
our 'Z' systems.  Would it not be appropriate to consider incorporating a
system call which returns a pointer to ENV in these new bdos's?

Subject: Redirecting printer output to file

When a large quantity of output is to be redirected, utilities that
rely on an in-memory buffer are inadequate.

BackGrounder ii includes a print spooling command that will redirect
output of any number of successive programs, limited only by the
capacity of the disk to hold the output file.  The companion "Q"
utility prints files from a queue as a true background process, i.e.
while you are running other programs.  The spooling features were
reviewed in Profiles, May 1988.

Not quite. I think what is required is PIP FILE.XYZ = LST: I have a TSR
that catches console output, and it should be trivial to modify it to
catch LST: output.

" Actually, no. What is needed is some form of i/o capture utility. I believe

I was a little terse -- I couldn't remember anything more than that I
had used PIP for this on the Kaypro II.  Now it's coming back to me.  A
terminal program with a capture-text-in-file mode should work.  But you
can use PIP if you're desperate.  You have to modify PIP with DDT by
inserting a few assembler instructions to read the port.  This is a
supported hack -- there's a little room left in PIP for this very
purpose.  As I recall, there is ascii text in the PIP code saying where
the right place is.

Well, there is some confusion, anyhow.  I thought the original posting
concerned redirecting stuff coming from the serial port.  If it was
stuff going to the serial port instead, what I said about PIP is
not relevant.  By the way, the Unix-like shell that was once marketed
by New Directions allows this other type of redirection, also.  It's

It was here.

There was a program (called IOCAP) I saw some time ago that captured console
I/O and shunted it to a file. It was out of the CPMUG disks. I just took a
look through a printout of the SIMTEL20 archives, and found:
	kaypro/iocapkp.lbr
which might be the same thing. Unfortunately, my tape of the archives is at
another site and I don't have access to it (Jon, could you e-mail me a copy
of said .LBR file if convenient?), so I can't verify that it is this same
program.

If it is, it shouldn't be difficult to modify to capture printer output
instead - as long as the utility in question uses the LST: (PRN:?) device
and not direct port i/o.

I've thought such a utility would be handy at times.

The suggestions I have seen so far don't hack it.  PIP will redirect INPUT,
maybe (on a lucky day, anyway), but he wants to redirect OUTPUT.

I suppose he could hook his K10 up to his KII and use a terminal program
on the recieving Kaypro to capture the data.

I seem to recall someone posting or commmenting about a program that would
do what Craig is asking for, but it MAY have been for IBM-PC style systems
(sorry).  Was there such a posting HERE, or was I dreaming?  Can anyone

there was a lot of stuff there for factory use, including a demo that

from the monitor level, but not from CPM, so I can't make VDO work.  As

Actually, no. What is needed is some form of i/o capture utility. I believe
there is one somewher in the CP/MUG archives that could be modified to do
this (called, I believe, IOCAP), but I don't know of a utility to do this.

PIP will copy a file to the printer port, but it won't divert printer output.

There is no standard way to do this.  It wouldn't be hard to write a
utility to do it; the utility would shuffle itself to high memory and
load the application (like DDT), capture the BDOS "print character"
vector, and buffer and write a disk file.

In the latest one I have, its listed in the index (along with CP/M Turbo Pascal)
but it isn't on the pages listed.  I too am interested in the fate of TM2.  I've
been using it develop some graphics modules for the MicroSphere graphics board
that I have in my Kaypro 2X.  I is noticeably faster than Turbo Pascal for
this.  The bit and cardinal operations seem to be particularly fast.  I got
my copy second hand; Echelon had my still uncashed check when they folded.

When I fire up Qterm, everything works fine until I type somthing to the

Are these bdos cals set up properly in commodore's version of cp/m+?

Subject: ZCPR and HLLs

   There is one comment about gaining access to Z-System facilities with
programs written in high level languages that I neglected to make earlier. 
There is, in a weak sense, an operating system call that returns the ENV
address.  The ZCPR command processor since version 3.3 has placed the
environment address in the HL register on entry to a program.  If the high
level language allows the user to gain control before some initialization
package loses the information in HL, then this can be used (but, as always,
should be validated before it is trusted).  This is essentially a
modification of Bridger's patch suggestion or the suggestion of recoding
C.CCC.  It is much easier just to save the contents of HL than it is to
create the whole Z header as Bridger described.  Such a program, however,
will fail with versions of ZCPR before 3.3.  BackGrounder ii has supported
this facility from the beginning, however, and will work fine.
 
   Having a real DOS call is a very interesting idea.  Perhaps the DOS
version function call could return the ENV address as well.  The problem is
that the new DOSs may already be absolutely full, with no spare bytes for
this.  But it is certainly a suggestion worth passing along to the authors. 
Also, if you are using one of the public-domain DOSs (Z80DOS, P2DOS,
NOVADOS), then you can try putting it in yourself.
 
   Another possibility is to load an RSX that would provide this extended
service.  The roughly 2K memory cost might, however, be too much to pay.  It
might be an interesting and easy way to experiment, however.

I thank you much.  By the way, if you are just plain interested in the

This brings to mind two questions I was wondering if someone could

2.  Has anyone sucessfully transplanted 3.5-inch disks, or added one
to the system?  (3.5's are a whole lot more readily available,
and a bunch cheaper, too.)

Thanks for any responses!!

TCJ does not focus exclusively on CP/M-80, but it has a very strong
interest in that direction.  It is one of the few remaining magazines
with a hobbyist orientation.  I have a regular column on Z-System
(an advanced CP/M replacement operating system), and Bridger Mitchell
has a regular column on topics in advanced CP/M (things like file
structures, subtleties of the DOS and BIOS, and so on).  Rick Charnes
will now be contributing regularly.  His articles will deal with uses
of Z-System and DateStamping, among other things.

Computer Helper Industries Inc makes a CPM add-on/replacement called
CONIX that does redirection.  You can redirect console input and output
as well as printer output.  You also get pipes, a fairly sophisticated
batch file language, named or tree directories, utilities and online
manuals.  I haven't taken the time to get it up on my 8/16, but it
ran pretty well on my 820-II before my hard disk went read-only.
The complete package is about $70, and shareware versions start at
$20

The problem, or course, is that the IF ("if the high level language..."), 
is a very big IF indeed!  It seems to me that most HLLs running 
under cp/m must, of necessity, have the entry to their initialization 
routines at 100h, where they will execute before any routine the 
programmer provides.

The suggestion was a system call which would return the ENV address.  It 
seems to me that this would provide a standardized way for any program, 
ASM or HLL, to obtain the information.  Presumably, the present system 
would also have to be maintained for backward compatibility.

But the present system is really, with all due respect to Jay, a kludge, 
albeit an ingenious one.  When ZCPR 3.0 was written, the Cp/m world was 
stuck with the Digital Research bdos, so another way had to found to 
transfer the ENV address to a transient program.  Z3INS was the answer; 
and under ZCPR 3.3/3.4 Jay ingeniously converted the original installation 
system to an auto-install system.

Now, however, we have alternatives to the Digital Research bdos, and one 
or the other of these alternatives are probably going to be used on most 
up to date systems.  We expect to be able use calls such as #27 (return 
ALLOC address), #31 (return DPB address); what is conceptually different 
about call #nn (return ENV address)?

Subject: CP/M for the TRS80 Model II

Cheap computing is now available to YOU the consumer!

I was feeling flush this week so I bought a copy of P&T CP/M for my Model II
(to replace an old pirated copy of Lifeboat CP/M).

TriSoft in Texas is selling P&T CP/M with complete documentation and a visual
editor and DSDD capability for US$85.00.  An upgrade of an old legal copy of
CP/M is even cheaper.

If you have considered using CP/M instead of TRSDOS or upgrading an old version
or going legal this is the time to do it.

But thats not all!!

Micropro is selling CP/M Wordstar Version 4 for US$89.00 as well so I bought a
copy to replace my copy of version 2.x.

It is very hard to find a good reason to buy a new computer.

Now that I have four eight inch drives running on my Model II I thought it would
be kind of nice to run a hard disc and maybe two floppies (oh heck run four).

At one time Radio Schlock sold a 15M hard drive for the price of a used Volvo
which from the pictures seems to be the size of a VW Microbus.

Questions.

What were these drives and how common are they?

Have any of you put a hard disc of any form on a Model II and what did you
learn from it?

How easy is it to make the hard disc bootable?  Have you found a way to boot
the hard disc with elegance, say so that if a floppy is in drive 0 then you
boot from drive 0?

Am I being really ignorant?

Strangely enough, nobody has yet quoted that CP/M 3 (alias CP/M + ) does it,

So the next question will be, where to find CP/M 3 for those Kaypros, I guess.

On the chance that he is having to repeat my efforts with wordstar, I had
to write a serial printer driver for Wordstar 3.01 years ago...  If he needs
it (to crib code from if nothing else) I'll be happy to send it to him.
It sits in the patch space, and opens a file and then procedds to dump all
printer output to it.  When the printer is done, the file is closed, all
neat and pretty.  One of the projects on the stack is to hack my BIOS to
implement another redirection target (UL1: or something) to be a modification
of that old patch - to some file like OUT.OUT, which would then be renamed.
 
Or something.

Lastly, one kludge that I used one time was a serial print buffer, with the
output stalled with a ^S.  I dumped the file into it, then ran the
modem program, after it was up I started the capture function, swapped
ports on the buffer, and a ^Q sucked the file in.  It worked, but it took
a couple of tries and a breakout box to do it.

Subject: TRS-80 Model-II hard disks

Richard,

  To answer some of your questions:

There are a number of sources for new/used hard disks for the Model-II,
-12,-16, and -6000.  Pacific Exchange sells them, as does Kilgore's
Electronics (Ft. Worth, TX).  Computer Shopper also has ads, both 
display and classified, from folks with drives to sell.  There is now
everything from 8.7 mbyte drives up to 70 mbyte (and I know some
folks using the 12 Mbyte controllerr with a 330 mbyte drive).

Most of the machines will boot directly from the hard disk (if 
available, and with the boot track software written).  Some of the
older Model-II's did not come with the boot rom for the hard disk.
On those models you have the choice of finding a new boot rom, or 
of booting first from floppy, then telling it so switch to the hard
disk.  [Note:  This is also what you do if you want to partition the
hard disk for both CP/M and TRSDOS or CP/M and XENIX.  You set it up
to boot TRSDOS/XENIX directly, or use the floppy to link to the CP/M
partition of the hard disk.]

Holler if I can help.

Subject: Question about altos mp/m//cp/m

I am looking at purchasing and altos machine which has some software that
I am interested in.  The hard-disk (10 or 20 meg) boots mp/m which I guess 
is a multi-user cp/m.  It has an 8" floppy drive, and mp/m seems to read 
the mp/m (double density) floppies ok, but it can't read the single density 
cp/m floppies that have the software I am more interested in.  It's a 
leftover machine so the people getting rid of it don't know what it can do. 
Documentation is next to non-existent.

My question is this:  Is that 8" drive a dual density drive and do I need a 
single density cp/m boot floppy to get it started or what?

Subject: PX-8 FILINK

FILINK is yet another variation on the XMODEM theme, but has its
own idiosyncracies.  As far as I know--and I tried to find out some
time ago when they were still "supporting" the machine in the US--Epson
was never willing to release the details of the protocol.  They did
distribute versions of the software for one of their desktop CP/M
machines, for at least one of their PC clones, and for the IBM PC itself.
The latter never worked, at least in the copy I got; I can't speak
for the others.

Two suggestions:  There is a version of CP/M kermit set up for the
PX-8 which works well as long as you don't try transferring large
files to and from the optional diskette drive.  And there is another
program that Epson sells, called "Geneva Connection" or something like
that in the US, which supports XMODEM and does so reasonably well.
FILINK seems to be mostly a write-off.

I know you are in the Netherlands, so suggesting that you go to the
simtel20 archives is not possible.  However, they have the source code
to a FILINK-compatable modem program.  Source is included, so the rest
(protocol) should be easy to determine.

Reference the MIT grad who asked about EMACS.  Apparenly Perfect Writer
is a very clos approximation to EMACS.  Unfortunately Perfect Software
is now defunct.  Perfect Writer was bundled with the CPM Kaypro
computers.  I don't know of the legality of just getting a copy, but
perhaps you can find a Kaypro user who is using WS and no longer wants
his Perfect Writer.  It is not an exact clone, but I recently started
using EMACS on a MULTICS machine and I have only found one or two

Some time ago I indicated that Turbo Pascal would again become available. 
Having seen an announcement on the Lillipute Z-Node, I can now make the

Since I am passing on this information, I honor-bound to add the following
caveat.  Sage Microsystems East and I, personally, have received a great
many reports of serious order fulfillment problems with Alpha Systems. 
Therefore, although Alpha's notice indicates that it will accept payment in
the form of a check, money order, or COD shipment, I recommend that only COD
be used.  That way, if you never receive the product, at least you have not
paid for it.

I'm trying to acquire a shareware or PD implementation of either
Xmodem, Ymodem, or Kermit for a Kaypro II running CPM 2.2H. A
friend is making a great leap forward by upgrading their non-profit
arts administrative office systems from a Kaypro II to the brave
new world of a Macintosh SE.  They've got com software for the Mac
but hope to avoid keying their proposals, budgets, boiler plate and
2000 person mailing list into the Mac. Quite!

Said Kaypro uses 5.25" diskettes, formatted to hold 390K which I
assume is DSDD.

Anyway, If you've a CPM box that can write this format I'll gladly
send a floppy (formatted if need be) to anyone gracious enough to
run off a copy for me.

Subject: Soft-Sector for Northstar Horizon?

Well, after a three-month disruption (work and hobbies don't always mix),
I have resumed my search for a C compiler.  I've narrowed it down to BDS,
Aztec and Toolworks.  I had called Leor Zolman about BDS, and made a most
distressing discovery: he doesn't distribute on hard-sector floppies.  
Subsequent examination of the literature from MANX and Software Toolworks 
revealed that they can't help me and my DSDD 10-sector drive, either.  So,
I guess I *first* need to get a soft-sector drive onto my system.  Anyone
remember that cute song about Dear Henry and the bucket?  

Anyway, I am pursuing two solutions.  The first is to simply purchase a soft-
sector controller and a drive, and hammer out the driver in Z-80 assembler.
The disadvantage of this is cost: a new Compupro Disk 1B lists for $620.
As the guy who sold me this system concluded, at these prices one is better
off buying a PC clone.  So, does anyone know of less expensive boards, or have 
one they want to sell?  Does it bother anyone else that S-100 boards are
getting more expensive while watches, calculators, VCR's and CD players have
dropped in price?

The other possibility is to build a SCSI ontroller, as some people on this
list have done, and buy a SCSI drive.  Assuming that I can find S-100 format
prototyping boards, this would probably be cheaper.  Also, I would relish
getting back to component-level work.  Any leads on prototyping boards?
Has anyone on this list, in addition to Doug Braun, done this?

Jerry Black asked about a product from Rainbow Technologies which converted
the OKIDATA ML-82/83 to a ML-92...well not quite.  The product I have from
the company is called PC-Writer and it performs functions similar to a ML-92
converted to support IBM-PC/Epson NLQ and graphics.  Generally, the product
is good, subject to the limitations of the OKIDATA itself.  It also does not
always behave exactly like the Epson in specialized functions, but it is close.

I have had the card for nearly three years.  It consists of a small board 
which clips over the existing ROMS.  At the time it was around $100.  I have
seen the company sell it for $80 recently.  I recommend that you call the
company.  I called them to iron out some early bugs in the firmware and the
people graciously sent me two replacement sets of PROMS.

There is another solution - call Workman and Associates in Pasadena, Ca.
at 818-791-7979 (BBS: 791-1013) and order BDS from them.  One of their
services is disk format conversion from (and to) over 350 different
formats, including 8", 5 1/4", 3 1/2", CP/M (-80, -86, -68k), MS/PC-DOS,
UNIX, Atari, etc, etc, etc.  I just got off the phone with Barry Workman,
and he has no problem with supplying a copy of the BDS with a second set
of North Star 10 sector floppies - in fact he has the media in stock.

Let me know if this helps.

The following got mangled:
Computer Surplus Store, which advertises in Byte and Computer Shopper
has Xebec 1420 SASI boards which will handle two winchester and two
floppies. The price is $29 + $8 for manual(essential). You will also
need a SASI-SCSI host adaptor for your computer. This can be pretty dumb.
The Adaptec 4000 manual ( also $8 from C.S.S ) has a schematic for a
S100 host board. They also sell Apple host adaptors, and JDR sells one for
PC's for $50.

Subject: STARLINK - an alternative to PC Pursuit

The following is provided "as-is" for its informational value.  It is from
a file that was recently uploaded to my BBS.  I cannot answer questions as
I have no connection with this service.

---cut-here---

STARLINK is an alternative to PC Pursuit.  You can call 91 cities in
28 states during off-peak hours (7pm-6am and all weekend) for $1.50
per hour.  All connections through the Tymnet network are 2400 bps
(1200 bps works too) with no surcharge and there are no maximum hours
or other limitations.

There is a one time charge of $50 to signup and a $10 per month
account maintenance fee.  High volume users may elect to pay a $25
per month maintenance fee and $1.00 per hour charge.

The service is operated by Galaxy Telecomm in Virginia Beach, VA and
users may sign up for the service by modem at 804-495-INFO.  You will
get 30 minutes free access time after signing up.

This is a service of Galaxy and not TYMNET.  Galaxy buys large blocks
of hours from TYMNET.  To find out what your local access number is
you can call TYMNET at (800) 336-0149 24 hours per day.  Don't ask
them questions about rates, etc., as they don't know.  Call Galaxy
instead.

Galaxy says they will soon have their own 800 number for signups and
information.

The following is a listing of the major cities covered.  There are
others that are a local call from the ones listed.

Subject: Where is Ron Murray, author of ZMP?

Recently I installed ZMP on my Ampro Z80 LB+.  ZMP is a ZMODEM program
for CP/M, and can be found in the SIMTEL20 archives.  ZMP works great
for 9600 baud binary file transfers on channels with ^S/^Q flow
control, but the terminal portion of the program seems to drop
characters at 9600 baud.  I'd like to try speeding up the terminal
portion so I can use it for interactive work as well.

I would like very much to get in touch with Ron Murray, author of ZMP.
The only address I found for Ron was this one in the ZMP doc file:

	Ron Murray
	Z-Node 62
	Perth, Western Australia
	(061+) 09-450-0200

Would anyone having an e-mail or postal address for Ron (or Ron, if
you're reading this) please respond to one of the addresses below.
Thanks.

I thought that this was what I was suggesting.  At the moment there is no
such support in the DOSs.  Adding another full function call, while nice,
may entail too great a penalty in the code.  The new DOSs already have new
function calls to identify themselves, and I was suggesting the possibility
that this new call could be modified to serve as the GETENV function as
well.  This was just a way to keep the code shorter.
 
NZCOM makes it easy to allocate space for an expanded DOS, but doing so
entails risks, since there are quite a number of programs that make use of
the standard sizes defined by Digital Research.  We probably will soon be
playing with DOSs and CCPs that are larger than standard.
 
I realized that few HLLs would allow one to get control of the code before
they obliterate the contents of the HL register pair.  In any case, however,
the patch required to capture the value in HL is quite a lot easier to
implement than one that has to simulate a full Z3 header on the program.  In
fact, it seems almost trivial except for figuring out where to store the
address so the program can find it later.  Perhaps the ENV address could be
put in the word at 101H and the byte at 100H changed to C9H (RET) to prevent
catastrophic reexecution using the GO command.  This would be system
independent (unlike trying to use some area in page 0).  But I don't know
much about the inner structure of HLL programs, so there may be obvious
answers (or problems) that I am ignorant of.
 
I cannot go into any details at this time, but there is a good chance that
sometime this year a version of a popular high level language with integral
support for Z-System features will be released commercially.  If anyone has
any suggestions as to what features they would like to see supported, please
let me know.  Obviously the ENV address will be available.  The next item on
my list was support for DIR: (named directory) references in all file and
directory specifications.  Access to TCAP functions (via a standard Z
library) would be desirable also.  Have I missed any important functions
that must be built into the main compiler code (and could not be handled by
a function library)?  Thanks for any input you can offer.

Subject: Amstrad Disks

A short while back someone asked about the capacity of diskettes on the
Amstrad computer.  I have a PCW512 with one single-sided double-density
drive and one double-sided quad-density drive.  Diskettes formatted for the
former hold 173K (and both sides can be used, giving a total of 346K on the
physical diskette).  This morning, when I made these measurements, I could
not find an empty quad diskette.  A quick estimate (formed by trying --
after only three hours' sleep last night and without a calculator -- to add
the space free to the space occupied in several user areas as shown by SDZ)
gave a value of just over 700K.  One would expect roughly 2 x 346 = 692, but
there is some additional space as a result of fewer system tracks.  If the
person asking this question needs an exact figure, I would be happy to make
a more careful measurement.

Subject: mex & downloading files

OK, thanks guys for all your help with the Profiles dilemma.  Now I've
got another problem.  It'll probably seem quite silly to all you cp/m
experts out there but I need to know how to download a file from a bbs.
I'm using a Kaypro 2X running cp/m 2.2g (no upgrades have been done
here :-) )with an Anchor Automation Signalman Mark XII
modem.  I'm using MEX 112 as my communications software.  Here's the
scenario:  I logged onto the KUGROS (Kaypro BBS) and I moved around
to the area that I wanted (By the way I don't just have a problem
with this bbs it's that I DON'T KNOW what I'm doing!!)  The prompt is
"To DOWNLOAD A FILE enter FILENAME.EXT or 1 to 11" The numbers
corresponding to a specific file.  The xmodem protocol is set on my
version of mex and on the bbs so of course I enter the number
corresponding to the file I want to download and the bbs gives me a msg
that the file is ready to be downloaded and it's waiting for me to give
it something.  My question is WHAT am I supposed to do here?  The GENIE
system says something about starting a receive file.  Is that the same
as turning on capture mode?  If so how long does it take for something
to look like it's happing?  I need step by step info here - you're 
explaining it to someone who's about to
pull her hair out.  I tried changing the protocol to xonxoff (which
according to the documentation on the bbs is for simple ASCII text
transfers) and boom I can download the file with no problem both ascii
and binary files, but when I get to trying to run the files, for example
unarc.com, it will not run.  What's the problem?  I am totally confused
and the documentation I have on MEX112 either isn't complete or it
wasn't written to be a step by step tutorial for the COMPLETE NOVICE.  I
know I probably should have learned all this stuff a LONG time ago (when
cp/m was the in os) but I
never had the interest (bad term).  If someone has some simple (and I
really mean simple) documentation they could send me I'd REALLY
appreciate it or if you could explain downloading to me so that I can
understand it I'd appeciate that also.  As I said it's not the bbs it's
just my lack of knowledge on the subject.  I had the same problem on
GENIE.  Right now I'm using the university computer system  - an AT&T
3b15 and it's so much easier to ftp from sites than to download from a
bbs.  You just find the file you want and say "get fn.ft" and in a few
minutes you have it.  Of course I'm using procomm, I guess it's kermit
protocol(?), and I'm connected to the LAN.  Can life be that simple
using my kaypro2x?  I really would like it to be.  I too have considered
changing from cp/m to dos but I've found out that there's so much
software out there that it's not necessary for me to do so -- if I can
just get to it, DOWNLOAD it, and make it work.  Hey I'm trying.  I've
had the KAYPRO business pak since late '84 or early '85 and I'm just
starting to see what awaits me through the use of my modem.  I just
learned how to connect to a bbs over the Christmas holiday. (OK quit
laughing)
Well I guess this just about covers it this go round.  Thanks in advance
for all your help and advice.  You really don't know how much I
appreciate it.

Subject: Osborne I malady

I have an Osborne I SS/DD 80-col mod. computer that I'm not using very much,
and one of the reasons is because it has a habit of munching sectors about
once an hour (when it writes to disk, of course).  More often than not, it
does it to the directory.  Have any of you Ozzie owners come across this
sort of thing in the past?  I'm wondering if it's going to cost much $$$
to get it fixed.  Yes, I've already cleaned the heads.  It happens with
both drives, so my guess is that it's not any moving parts.  And it does
it regardless of how long it's been running.  And yes, I have the Executive
fan installed.

                                1 YEAR          2 YEARS
                                ------          -------
 
        United States             $16             $28
 
        Canada                    $22             $42
 
        Surface Foreign           $24
 
        Air to Europe             $32
 
        Air to Elsewhere          $38
 
I did not ask Art Carlson about two-year rates outside the US and 
Canada.  The figures might be a bit daunting anyway!  I should add 
that a one-year subscription means six issues.  Subscriptions can be 
ordered by writing or calling:

        Columbia Falls, MT 59912  (that's Montana!)
        406-257-9119
 
TCJ accepts checks, MasterCard, and VISA.

Subject: Thanks on UUCP Help

Thanks to all who helped me with the linkage from ARPA Net to UUCP.
Here are some of the suggestions I received for replacing a return
address like "xxx%yyy.uucp@RELAY.CS.NET".
 
   xxx%yyy.uucp@uunet.uu.net
 
        This was the address that was recommended most frequently.  I
        have been using it, and it seems to be working.
 
   xxx%yyy.uucp@rutgers.edu
 
        Rutgers, I was told, has some responsibility for UUCP and thus
        should be able to handle the routing.
 
   xxx%yyy.uucp@ukc.ac.uk
 
        This was recommended for connection to Great Britain.
 
Some otheres were:
 
   xxx%yyy.uucp@ucbvax.berkeley.edy
   xxx%yyy.uucp@harvard.harvard.edu
   xxx%yyy.uucp@xait.xerox.com
   xxx%yyy.uucp@cfisun.cfi.com

Subject: Address correction for Royal Oak support

I have received several messages saying that mail addressed to the
Royal Oak Support Fund was returned by the post office as
undeliverable.  This problem was caused by the fact that we are
sharing the box with another BBS and I neglected to include a "care
of" line in the address.  Sorry for the inconvenience this caused.

Here is the correct address:

	RCP/M Royal Oak Support Fund
	c/o Detroit Download Central
	P.O. Box 36238
	Detroit, MI  48236

Please make checks payable to me because the system does not have a
bank account of its own.

Thanks!

Subject: Fast IIe 80 col. driver patched

For those of you with enhanced //e's (or equiv) that run CP/M,
you may remember that when using the PCPI "Fast //e 80 col" driver,
you get mousetext when reverse video is displayed.

I have patched this driver to properly handle enhanced //e's
and the mousetext has been banished. On the down side, you
can't send a ctrl-X to get the mousetext as you could without
the driver. Also, (at least on the IIgs) I can't tell the
difference between having the driver working and not having
it. But that's not my department.

Anyone who wants the revised "New" fast 2e driver, just give
me a shout.

Subject: Wanted -- info about '82 Zeda

Hello, CPM world.

I just got (for free; its monitor is flaky) a Zeda CPM computer.

Its circuit board says it's from 1982, and the owner, who didn't want
to fix it, says it's a CPM machine.

However, I have no software for it, nor have I any idea what version
of CPM it uses.  Description follows:

It has a full keyboard, keypad, monitor, 2 full-height 5 1/4"
floppies.  (It resembles a TRS-80 Model 3)

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

Sincerely,
Rob Levene
