Subject: New processor rumour

I've heard some rumours that Zilog recently has released a NEW version of the
Z80 processor. The new version should (according to the rumours) have a largely
expanded instruction set, with multiplication, division, SIO routines, etc...

Is this actually the case? I thought Z80 was out years ago.

You aren't thinking about the Z280?  I'm pretty sure it's out on the market
now.  A friend of mine has preliminary specs dating back to 1984 (it was 
the Z800 back then).

Here's a brief rundown of the new architecture from what I remember:

   * 16 bit bus
   * 16meg addressibility, although programs still only see the 64k
     address range of the Z80.  There are 16 page registers for mapping.
     It can either be done by 8k pages with separate I&D mappings, or
     4k pages with no distinction between I&D.
   * Supervisor and user modes
   * Support for traps and exceptions, including stack overflow, page fault,
     illegal instruction, etc.
   * Builtin UART
   * Hardware programmable wait-states (0-15)

If anyone wants more info, I'll try to get it...

Depends on what you mean by "out".

To the magazines/periodicals (like EDN, EE Times, ESD (Electronic Systems
Design, NOT Electro-Static Discharge), Computer Design, etc. the Z80 might
be "out" because it is not the "newest, flashiest, most powerful 32-bitter"
offered. Remember, these magazines try to "hype" the high-tech stuff
because that is what is "exciting" to all of the engineers. If you read
these mags a lot, then you might very well get the idea that 8-bit is
"out" and the only kind of processor any self-respecting engineer would
desing with is the latest 32-bit RISC machine.

Actually, the 8-bit processors and single chip computers/controlers
represent the largest share of revenue generated by the companies which
supply processors to the commercial market...they are used in things like
microwave ovens, refridgerators, copy machines, soft drink machines, etc.
(note...TI still makes lots of bucks selling 4-bit micros!)

It will probably be a loooong time before the 8-bitter bites the dust, if
ever.

I know I will probably get MANY flames for this....even though the stuff I
am presently working on is 25 MHz 68030 VME, I still have a soft-spot in my
heart for the good old 65C02! I catch "hell" for saying this from my
co-workers all of the time!

Keith is absolutely right. UNARC 1.6 does handle squashed members. I
checked the version of UNARC that I use and it is version 1.6. My
problem was that I would get a error stating that the archive file
could not be found. It turns out that the archive name has an "_"
(underscore) in it. Evidently, UNARC (or CP/M?) doesn't recognize
the underscore as a valid file name character. When I renamed the
archive, all was well. Thanks to Keith for getting me back on track.

The problem is in CP/M.  You are right, CP/M does not recognize the
underscore.  This means that some (but not all) programs cannot handle
underscores in file names.  For example, WordStar (if I remember right) can
create files with underscores and then deal with them correctly, but you
cannot copy, delete, rename, pip or do many other things to them.

I never thought my daughter would become an interested computer user at
her young age, but such is the case.  One of her favorites is the small
adventure game I made up for her (using a heavily modified ADVEN80
adventure generator - source available if anyone is interested).  The
original adventure is a tad to much for her, although she loves it.
However, turn back the clock ...

Remember the old Scott Adam's series of Adventure games.  I had one or two
on an old machine called the Sorcerer, but that is a pain having only
a cassette drive to load 16k.  At one time, I recall the whole series
being sold on a disk for CP/M.  Does anyone even remember this or can
lead me to a place where I can get them?

My daughter and I thank you.

It's on the market since over one year. It is software-compatible to the
Z80, but not hardware-kompatible, because it's timning differs a little
bit.

If anyone wants more information, (s)he can get it: I've the data-sheet
of the Z280 and a Z280 itself...

This fellow is (in my opinion) referring to the chip called the Z180 by Zilog.
It is in fact a Hitachi product, the HD64180, which has been around for several
years, and now Zilog can at least sell it.  I have used many of them, in the
SB180 single-board computer.  This machine is highly recommended for Z80, CP/M,
and ZCPR3 enthusiasts.  For info see the articles in BYTE magazine in September
and October 1985.  There is now an electrically Z80 compatible version of the
64180 (it's always been software compatible), so you can use the same annoying
peripheral chips.  In fact, you won't need them, because the 64180 (aka Z180)
has a 2-channel CTC, DMA, SIO, and other goodies all on one chip, as well as
the ability to handle up to 1 MByte.  A few new instructions are added, mostly
to handle the internal I/O ports, and there IS a multiply (8 x 8) instruction
(sorry, no divide instruction) It's also an inexpensive chip. Get an
SB180 from Micromint ($300., 25 Terrace Dr., Vernon, CT 06066 USA
(800)-635-3355)  I know the chip's price is $12. in moderate quantities.

Subject: adding a hard disk to your floppy-only system

Well, I just bought myself a nice hard disk controller for my S100 system.
Having looked over the CPM manual for a bit, it seems to me that I *should*
be able to accomplish the task of adding the controller and hard disk to
my system.

When I had my Kaypro 10, I seem to recall that it could boot off of either
the hard disk OR a floppy.  However, one time I tried to make my system
boot off of my ramdisk with much less than pleasant results :-).
I figured at the time that it had to do with booting from something other
than drive A.  However, as I think about the Kaypro 10 I doubt it.

So, enough rambling, down to the question for the net:

Has anyone else added a hard disk to a CP/M system which was not originally
configured for a hard disk?  Can I do the trick that Kaypro did and boot
from either flops or hard?  Any words of wisdom? (Other than "Don't do it!" :-)

TIA, very much. (*)

Rusty.

On the topic of the old Scott Adams adventure games and their availability
for CP/M, I seriously doubt there is any legit place to get them.

I believe that Mr. Adams company, Adventure International, is defunct.

But they used to be available, because I purchased an 8" SSSD disk with
CP/M versions of all twelve adventures on it via special order from the
local computer store back in '82, I think.  It cost me $100 or so.

I have not seen it in the Central Computer Products CP/M times catalog
(although, curiously, Turbo Modula-2 *is* in it) or anywhere else in
many years.

I was at a ham swap yesterday, and picked up 2 of those tone dialers
you stick up in front of your telephone to autodial.  (Well, ok,
I traded them for some books.  I would not have bought them, thats
for sure!).  It seems to work pretty well.

If your application is such that you don't really need hours of
fast redial before the person on the other end answers the phone,
you might consider one of those.  (Radio S sells one for $15, and
I got 2 'PortaTouch Tone dialers' at the swap meet, so email me if
you want to talk about mine :-).

I have a Xerox 820-1 single board CP/M computer.  When I got it, it was
not expandable to allow adding a hard disk.  After checking around a bit,
I found an inexpensive (for the time) 5MB hard disk ($99) and a SCSI
HD controller (also $99).  Now the Xerox 820 did not have a SCSI interface,
so, I had to build my own adapter as well as write my own HD driver.
The hardware adapter was not very sophisticated (i.e. not interrupt driven).
I just wire wrapped an adapter that plugged into the Z-80 socket.  This
allowed me to 'tap' the I/O and data lines that I needed for the SCSI
controller.  I added some TTL logic to decode the address that I wanted
to use for the controller and then began to write the software to access
the SCSI port.

I wrote the necessary routines and added them to my BIOS.  I probably
could have made it boot off of the HD, but, that would have required me
to patch the ROM.  Since I didn't have access to an EPROM burner, I
elected to use a hybrid method.  What I did was to modify the boot tracks
of the floppy so that instead of loading CP/M (BDOS & BIOS) from the
floppy, I loaded the HD driver.  After the driver was in memory, I
loaded CP/M from the hard drive (I SYSGENed a modified boot track onto
the HD).  I also faked out CP/M to make my HD (drive E:) my default drive.
So, when I booted the system, it automatically came up logged into
the HD. Using this method, only a few sectors were loaded from floppy,
and then the rest of the booting occured from the HD.

While this was not the optimum way to do it, for me it proved to be
a viable way to get a HD up and running with minimal modifications to
my existing hardware & software.

I remember seeing an ad in a gaming magazine sold in the gaming store
at the local mall - i.e. the place that sells Dungeons & Dragons stuff,
Chess, etc.  Also some of the _bigger_ newsstands might have it.

Or go to the TRW swap meet, find an old copy of Byte, or Kilobaud, and
just maybe scott adams hasn't moved (but that's a long shot).

Scott is still writing games - you just have to look for the ads where
they do the most good, and that means gaming magazines.

I just took a look at Zilog's January 1989 Z80 Family Data Book and saw:

Z8400 (a.k.a Z80?):	("Advanced Information")
	At a quick glance this looks like a CMOS Z80, up to 10MHz. Nothing
	else jumps out as being different, other than packaging options.

Z80180 (a.k.a Z180?):	("Product Specification")
	"Code compatible", with 8-bit multiply (16 bit result) and several
	other new instructions (test and block operations, mainly). Up to
	10 MHz, on-chip MMU addressing 512k or 1Mbyte, two UARTS, two 16-bit
	timers, on-chip oscillator, etc.

Z280:	("Preliminary Product Specification")
	20 MHz CMOS pipelined Z80 superset with MMU addressing up to 16
	Mbytes, 3 16-bit counter-timers, 4 DMA channels, full-duplex UART,
	on-chip 256-byte instruction and data associative cache, co- and
	multi-processor support, etc. No mention of multiply/divide...


Interesting stuff (a 20 MHz Z80!!!), but working from Zilog's track record 
on the Z800 (I got a spec sheet in '81 - when was it that it actually came
out?), I won't believe it until I actually see it...

[Note:  I set Followups: to comp.os.cpm only as I don't believe anyone else
 would be interested in a 20 MHz Z80! :-)]

Check inside your fancy space-age washing machine and odds are you'll
find a Z80 running the show.  The same goes with things as diverse as
VCRs, multiport serial port boards for PCs, traffic light controllers
and a whole host of other stuff.  I've seen several times in print the
statement that the Z80 is still the single most widely used cpu out
there.  It's powerful, stable and dirt cheap; to a designer these are
all very endearing qualities. :-)

I'll 2nd the notion that 8-bitters aren't dead yet -- maybe not
even sick.  The Motorola 6809, last & best of the 8-bitters,
is still powering the OS9 multi-tasking, windowing OS in 100's
of 1000 of Color Computers.  It's an easy and fun chip to write assembler
for (being orthogonal and having lots of PDP-11 style addressing modes
on top of a 6502-type architecture for speed and simplicity) but
also a very easy machine to compile C, Forth, and Pascal for.

 Lots of applications (data communications, word processing, MIDI music)
deal in 8-bit bytes, so 16 or 32 bit architectures are overkill.

My copy of the preliminary BOOK for the Z280 shows all sorts of
Multiply and divide instructions.  Zilog decided to define a plethora of
new data types for this processor, so for each type there exists a mult/
divide instruction.  

I agree, I won't believe it untill _I_ see it either!

This is indeed the Z180...a.k.a. the Hitachi 68180. One of the interesting
things about this processor is that it executes many of the instructions
in fewer cycles than the Z80...so it gets a speed improvement 2 ways: faster
clock and executes in fewer cycles.

>Z280:	("Preliminary Product Specification")

I first heard about this one when I was an undergrad! It has been in
"pre-release" mode for about 6 years! The Z280 is the updated name for
the Z800...I think that there are actually chips available, but the first
ones have problems with the cache.

Ok Guys... Who knows about the Vector 4 graphics? I need some info...

1) It looks like I have two processors, a Z80 and either an 8080 or
   an 8088-2, the documentation is unclear which. Can I run IBM stuff
   with this thing if it is an 8088-2, and what can the 8080 do if that's
   what I have?

2) Does anyone know which processor I have (8088-2 or 8080)?

3) Can I run a Samsung modem off the sieral port? I am trying with a male-
   male rs232 and it's acting funny. The modem will talk to the computer, but
   not vice versa. Also, I have a switch that switches pins two and three on
   the modem, and that doesn't help at all. The modem works fine on an IBM PC
   even with the hardware modification.

4) What is the latest version of CP/M I can run with this thing? I have 1.4
   floating about somewhere, but it's Vector CPM 1.0 right now. Does putting
   1.4 on my hard disk mean I have to reformat it under 1.4, or can I keep
   the format as I have it now?

5) Why do my RAM Boards (North star or nor star 16K) have DIP SWITCHES on them
   and what do these dip switches do?

6) There is no Number Six.

7) If you can tell me what pins on the Serial com port have high and low
   voltage outputs and all that neat stuff, I'll name my firstborn son or
   daughter after you...

Thanks for your patience. I am new to CP/M and hardware hacking in general,
so this is all rather difficult.

If you had MS-DOS for Vector, you would be able to run some real
generic DOS-stuff on it.

The processors are Z80B and 8088-2.

I do have a modem connected to Vector's serial port, and it works just
fine. Try using just pins 2, 3 and 7 at the beginning. (data to both
directions and ground)

I think you now have Vector CP/M-86 V1.0, haven't you?
CP/M-86 is an CP/M-implementation that runs on 8088 and 8086-processors.
If you have CP/M-86 in your Vector you should also have a CP/M-80
emulator on your disks (RUN8.CMD). The emulator acts as CP/M-80 V2.2, as
far as I know.

What? Your Vector has RAM expansions in the S-100-bus, not on a
satellite board plugged over the motherboard?

While it is true that the Z280 (a.k.a. Z800) had an especially long
gestation, I just wanted the net to know that it most certainly is
available now. I have been running CP/M on mine for over a year now.
The on-board cashe definitely speeds up execution. The bus timing is
much improved over the Z80. I have nothing bad to report.

Subject: New Processor Rumours

The new Zilog Z280 processor is not a rumour! It is available in
Germany for 59.61 DM (some 32 US$, without VAT, single unit
price). The lastest revision is "J". It has no longer the cache
problem that was known with revision "G".

Some features have been mentioned on the net but there are still
more highlights:
   - It is fully software compatible with the Z80.
   - It uses less memory cycles than the Z80, e.g.
     EX DE,HL   EXX    LD A,B   all use only 2 cycles
   - It has new addressing modes:
     It has 16 bit displacements, e.g. LD A,(IX+1234H)
     It has a PC-relative addressing mode.
     It has a SP-relative addressing mode, e.g. LD (SP+1234H),5
     It has a so called "base index" addressing mode, e.g.
        LD (HL+IX),6   LD (HL+IY),7  LD (IX+IY),8
     You can also use 16 bit displacements with HL:  LD A,(HL+5678H)
   - Some other highlights:
     You can use the lower and upper half of the IX and IY registers
     individually (just as with HL). They are called IXL,
     IXH, IYL and IYH, e.g. "LD A,IXH". (These were unofficial
     instructions with the Z80.)

     It has 16 bit arithmetic, e.g.
        ADDW HL,1234H        16 bit add
        CPW  HL,BC           16 bit compare
        DECW (1234H)         16 bit decrement
        DIVW DEHL,1234H      16 bit divide
        DIVUW DEHL,BC        16 bit unsigned divide
        also signed and unsigned 16 bit multiply
        (there are also multiply and divide for 8 bits)
        NEG HL               16 bit twos complement
        SUBW HL,DE           no longer OR A   SBC HL,DE

     You can do
        CALL (HL)
        CALL cc,(HL)        conditional call
        INW HL,(C)          16 bit I/O
        PUSH 1234H
        LD (1234H),5678H
      and several other instructions, e.g. to handle the on-chip
      peripherals.

As far as I know the Z280 is the same chip as the one announced as
Z800 some years ago. It is not the same as the Z180 (= Hitachi 64180)
which has only a few new instructions.

Quite a few of us have added bootable hard drives to our non-hard drive
systems.  There is only one way to do it: replace the ROM inside your machine
so that it uses the hard disk controller for boot.  Even better, is to have
it look for a hard drive and, failing that, to look for a floppy.

This is what the Kaypro 10 did and essentially all after-market upgrade ROMs
for the Z80 machines (Xerox, Kaypro, Morrow, Osborne) do for you.  Since your
machine is an S100, you will probably have to "roll you own".  Given that you
have the source for the current boot ROM, enough room for the code, and an
EPROM burner, you are most of the way there.

The Z280 supports following types of multiplication/division:
- MULT A,r            - MULTU A,r
- MULTW HL,rr         - MULTUW HL,rr
- DIV HL,r            - DIVU HL,r
- DIVW DEHL,rr        - DIVUW DEHL,rr
  (DEHL => DE & HL taken as 32-bit-register)
where rr is one of
- BC, DE, HL, IX, IY, SP, nn, (nn), (IX+nn), (IY+nn), (PC+nn)
  (nn as a 2-byte-adress/offset)
and r is one of
- A, B, C, D, E, H, L, HX, LX, HY, LY, (HL), (nn), n, (HL+IX|IY),
  (IX+IY), (IX|IY+n), (IX|IY|HL|PC|SP+nn)
  (n as 1-byte-offset)

These new adressing-modes are supported in most commands (ADC, ADD,
AND (all type A,r), ADDW HL,rr, CP A,r, CPW HL,rr, DEC r|rr,
DECW rr, EX A,r, IN r,(C), INC{W} (see above), LD r|rr,r|rr (including
LD (nn),n, but not LD (nn),(nn)), LDW rr,rr (inc. LDW (nn),nn), OR A,r,
OUT (C),r, PUSH/POP rr (inc. PUSH/POP (nn) and PUSH/POP nn), rotation-
command in Z80-manner only, SBC/SUB A,r, SBC/SUBW HL,rr, XOR A,r)
and few new commands are implemented:
- DIV/MULT
- EPUM/EPUF/EPUI (for multi-processor-systems)
- MEPU (also mp-mode)
- PCACHE (cache clear)
- TSET r (test register contents and set flags)
- TSTI (C) (test input)
- LDCTL (for internal organisation/programming)
Important are the extended adressing-modes of CALL & JP:
- CALL cc,rr            - JP cc,rr
with cc as well-known from Z80 and rr on of following:
- (HL), (PC+nn), nn (CALL & JP)
- (IX), (IY) (JP only - like Z80)
Some other facts of Z280
- seperate memory- and i/o-wait-states, can be modified by software
- cache configurable as data- or instruction-cache (or both)
- 16-bit-i/o-adress supported
- single-step-mode
- user/system - mode
  (system-SP, user-SP)
But... the instruction-set may be a superset to that of the Z80,
one opcode differs from Z80 : TSET has the same opcode as SLIA
from Z80 (undocumented, but working). using this command, your
software is able to distinguish between Z280 and Z80.

The vendor of the HDC usually provided a BIOS in source that had to be added
to the system BIOS to connect the drive.  I would assume that it would be
possible to boot off the HD, but none of the systems I every used did (S-100
systems with Advanced Digital, Morrow, and Jade HDC's).  The AD HDC came with
autoinstall software; the other two required revisions of the BIOS.  One of the
last books about CP/M to be published had a BIOS based on the JADE controller.
I believe that old SIG/M and CP/MUG disks may also have BIOSes.

	This one really exists as Z280.
	In addition to those features mentioned above it has:

	* Z80 object code compatible (runs Z80 code)
	* builtin DMA (4-channel)
	* 16-bit or 8-bit bus ( Z-bus or Z80-bus )
	* 10 MHz clock frequency ( future 25 MHz )
	* Support for Coprocessors (FPA-instructions defined)

	Zilog has finally released bugfree version of this.
	(earlier for example DMA and interrupts didn't work)
	( but who needs them, anyway :-)

That's right, if you only use the official Z80-instruction-set,
but who does. If you use the SLIA (shift left inverted arithmetic)
as I do, you get into a conflict, because this instruction-
sequence means TSET (Z280). And this difference is even mentioned
by Zilog in it's own Z280 Technical Manual (see Appendix A)!

Unfortunately the instruction-sets of Z180 and Z280 are so much
different, that you can't use a Z180-assembler to create Z280-
opcode...

Does anybody on the net know about a Z280-assembler (or a
pre-assembler to use an existing Z80-assembler)?

Subject: Help needed with modem sw for Kaypro

I need some help connecting an external modem to my RS-232C (J6) on my
Kaypro 4. Actually it's not the connection, but accessing the port.
I'm currently using SUPRTRM to drive my internaly modem which is
connected to J4. 

I'm looking for 1 of 2 possibilities:

	1) how do I patch SUPRTRM to address port J6 instead of J4

	2) is there any software available that allows interactive
	   changing of port addresses

If the answer to 2 is yes, then where can I get the software, and for
how much?

++Thanks,

I can only speak of my case with a Televideo TS803 from a semi-hypothe-
tical point of view.

The story - I have a TS803 (non hard disk version) and I added a
mini-winnie hard disk to it. So in response to your first question I
have added a hard disk to a floppy only system. To explain what is
necessary: all you have to do is to make the BIOS know about the
hard disk - add the necessary tables, and the code to read / write
it, and you can run from the hard disk.

That part is done, and works - i.e. I have a system with the original
floppies, and a hard disk "grafted" on.

As to booting it: I don't know how you work, but the boot process in
the 803 goes like this:

The boot rom reads drive A:, Track 0, Sector 0 into ram at a particular
spot, then jumps to that code. So I can put any bootstrap loader I like
into that 256 bytes of code - as it is, I just read the operating system
from the remainder of track 0 and track 1, and jump to the cold boot entry
point of the BIOS.

Assuming you work like this, if you can read and write the hard disk OK,
it can be done as a two step operation. Firstly write a boot sector
loader that will be pulled from floppy by the boot rom, that loads CCP /
BDOS / BIOS from the hard disk, and save that onto a floppy. Now when you
boot that floppy, the boot sector (T 0 S 0) comes off the floppy, drops into
ram, and is executed, but it goes to the hard disk to get the rest of
the operating system. Next step is to write this same boot sector somewhere
on the hard disk, and (here comes the hard part :-) ) modify the boot
rom to read from the hard disk. I plan to go about doing this for my
system in the above manner, and also plan to arrange that the rom looks
first to see if a floppy is present: if so boot from it. If not it then
looks at the hard disk to see if it can find anything there. So if I
reset with a floppy in drive A: I'll boot from the floppy, otherwise I'll
boot from the hard disk.

At least old versions of MEX are PD, and they are available for

   Zilog is shipping and companies are developing with the Z280.
   The Z280 has been available for about 8 months now and is quite
   a processor.  Nice features for MPM.

At last, an easy question.  Osborne I kermit is on the kermit
distribution tapes, and available from all of the usual kermit
distribution points.  It comes as an overlay to the CP/M-80 kermit. 
  You should be able to find it in Sweden, there is a kermit
distribution server on at least one EARN machine, or you may be able to
FTP it from either SIMTEL or WATSUN.CC.COLUMBIA.EDU if you really have
an Internet connection.  Send mail if you need more specific
information. 
   John Klensin,  Klensin@INFOODS.MIT.EDU
p.s.: If your friend has an Osborne internal modem on that machine (I 
don't know if those were sold in Europe), the kermit implementation is 
not designed to work with it.  It can be tricked into doing so and I'll 
dig out the instructions if you need them.

Is this true.....?

A friend of mine uses his MSX (CP/M compatible) computer to program in C
using ASCII C. This program generates a M80 ASM file, and compiles and links
it through a batchfile. He complains that the linking takes so long that it
is almost unworkable. Probably because it is written for 8080 computers, and
is as generic as possible.
Does anybody know of a faster linker preferably (but not neccesarily) with
source code ??? I can request from simtel-20.

Heeeeelp.  I just picked up a Vector 4.  It has a 5 meg harddrive, and one 600k
floppy.  The system came with the harddrive formated and the LINC version of
CP/M running.  No disks, except for two originals from some accounting program.
Neither of them have system tracks so the only way I can boot the machine is
off of the HD.  The HD only has the accounting programs, the LAN utilities,
and a couple of CP/M programs (NS, NULU, etc).  I cannot format the floppy.  
When I try it gives me an "INCOMPLETE FORMAT" error.  Besides, I don't have
the SYSGEN (GENSYS) program for copying the tracks.  Argh.  Is there anyone out
(I've seen people asking questions about the Vector :) there that I could get

I just got ZCPR 3.3 installed on my Apple II+ with a PCPI Applicard.  Works
beautifully!

However, I don't have any instructions for the unique abilities of ZCPR 3.3.
I still have the articles on ZCPR 2 from the interview by Computer Langauge
with Richard Conn.

Does any one know where I can get an in-depth description of ZCPR 3's
capabilities?  Thanks!

Well, you do have an old version of a great program (dont forget dBase 
is up to IV now), so, Ashton-Tate pretty much forgot about us...

If YOUVE got no qualms about piriting (sp), go right ahead and do it...
It cant hurt, since they just dont support the CP/M version anymore
What monies have they got to lose if they arent getting any to begin with?

I myself had my friend send me his latest copy (I cant read the disk
cause its on Commodore 128 format and I now have an Epson QX-10). 
Version 2.45 (I think)

If you like to goto computer shows, look around hard, cause you can always
find a vendor willing to 'unload' such obsolete software for a price

Now if the vendor still supports the CP/M version software (MicroPros     
WordStar 4, example), thats a different story... I paid $89.99 hard  
earned dollars for that!

I have used MEX v1.14 on a Kaypro; the program itself is binary only but the
driver for a specific system is in assembler and can be patched.  All of the
various MEX drivers, etc., were available from SIG/M and from various CP/M

Is version 4 the latest version of WordStar for CP/M, or have they
put version 5 on CP/M?  I've used Version 5 on IBMs, and I really
like it.  Does anyone know how the MS-DOS and CP/M versions
compare (performance, features, etc.)?

BTW, William, your friend with the 128 should be able to write to a

Hello. I recently got my S-100 system running with CPM 1.4. However, I'd like

know how to install it. There is no program analogous to MOVCPM, which was used
to install CPM 1.4. I was told that there was another method to installing it,
but that person didn't remeber what it was. The reason I'd like to do this is
that you need it to run most software on SIMTEL20...By the way, I have an 
Ithaca Audio Z80 CPU with a Tarbell SSSD controller running on 2 Shugart 801's.


Any and all help is appreciated...

[Egads, I didn't think 1.4 even existed anymore... :-)]

What exactly do you have for 2.2?   Just a 2.2 BIOS and BOOT? You'll still
need a copy of the CCP & BDOS (which can be produced by MOVCPM).  This is
spelled out in the 2.2 installation manual.

You might consider using P2DOS (or one of the other BDOS replacements) and
ZCPR3 instead - both, I think, available from SIMTEL20. With those at least
you'll have the source code!

Subject: Kermit and CP/M-80 computers

What you will need is:
  MLOAD (if you don't already have it)
  The HEX file for base kermit-80
  An overlay file for your machine, or the 'generic' one.  The
latter uses the BIOS, is proportionately slow, and requires IOBYTE 
support.
  If "your machine" is not one for which an overlay has been 
specifically created, then you will probably need to poke through the 
sources of the existing files to find something similar and, if 
necessary, modify it.
   These files are available from SIMTEL by FTP (the last I checked) 
from KERMSRV@CUVMA (and a few other places) on BITNET, and so forth.  
You will need at least some minimal way of downloading a HEX file to 
your machine to get started--it can be done using PIP if you can get the 
files onto some slightly more equipped machine and run a wire between
the two.

Subject: CP/M Status

 
   Grey Fox commented, "CP/M doesn't seem to even be considered an OS around
here anymore" and asked, "Is CP/M still going anywhere or is it a dead end?
I really wanna know."
 
   I just came back from the Trenton Computer Festival and was amazed at the
level of CP/M (Z-System) interest there.  Last year they gave us no
publicity, and many people who were interested in our session did not know
it was taking place or could not find out where it was.  This year the
publicity was good, and we had a room full of very interested people.  Next
year we plan to do even more and to demand some recognition from the
organizers, who otherwise recognized little more than MS-DOS (even the MAC
got short shrift).
 
   There is not much going on in CP/M proper, but Z-System, its modern
minicomputer-calibre replacement, is extremely active.  If Grey, or anyone
else, is interested in learning more, I would suggest that they subscribe to
The Computer Journal and pick up the last year's back issues.  I published
the information about TCJ not too long ago in a message here, but if there
is popular demand, I will repeat it.
 
   Grey will probably face some difficult problems trying to do anything
with the Vector computer (I'm assuming this is the VectorGraphic).  As I

were unable to crack.  We had a member who used a VectorGraphic machine, and

Subject: HD on Insight 128-I?

A friend without net access seeks to put a Seagate ST-225 hard disk onto
his Insight 128-I z80a-based single board computer (running CP/M 2.2,
Insight's CBIOS v.05I, currently configured for 8" floppies).  He is
looking for first-hand (or close second-hand) accounts of what was done
by someone who has successfully integrated a hard disk with an Insight.
His interest encompasses both hardware and software requirements that
the integration will entail.

Please resist the urge to offer assistance of a speculative nature; we're
looking for a "live" example.

Many thanks!

Subject: VT100 for the Osborne 1

I just got my hands on a Xerox CP/M computer which I would like to use
extensively as a terminal.  I've tried it out, assuming that it
emulates a VT52 (which I'm not sure about), and everything works fine
until I try to run vi or emacs on the remote machine.  It doesn't seem
to handle full-screen editing.  Does anyone have a clue as to what the
problem might be?  Better yet, can this thing do VT100 or H19 emulation?

Any advice you can give this novice would be greatly appreciated.

Subject: Z280 chip

Since Zilog has finally come out with a bug-free version of
the Z280 microprocessor, I am planning to resume work on my
Z280 board. However, the only distributor I can find
that has the correct revision of the chip (Western Microtechnology)
has a $100 minimum order.  (The chip is $35).

Does anyone know of a place that sells unit quantities of this chip
without a lot of hassle?  Otherwise, is there anybody who has been wanting
to buy one of these that would be interested in combining orders with
me?  Any other ideas on how to get hold of one of these chips would
also be appreciated.

From: ima!cfisun!lakart!dg@decvax.dec.com  (David Goodenough)
Subject: BDS-C V1.6

I recently got a copy of BDS-C V1.6 for my CP/M machine, and thought
I'd pass on my opinions of the system.

In general I am very pleased with the package, a lot of the library
"inconsistancies" from earlier versions have been fixed (fopen for one,
and the way printf("%s", "") works). For those that have not used it
it takes a couple of goes to get used to the absence of static variables,
but other than that, it is a very good implementation. For speed of
compilation it is blindingly fast. There was a review in Byte a while ago
benchmarking various CP/M C compilers, and BDS-C was consistantly (read
every time) the fastest, typically compiling in half the time required
by the others.

Included with the system is full source code for _ALL_ the libraries, so
you can hack what you don't like - for example I find the 5/C:FILENAME.EXT
system for user numbers a real irritant, so after a bit of messing I was
able to change the system to recognise C5:FILE format. The libraries
include not only the standard ones, but there is a floating point math
library, long integers math library, DIO (directed I/O - provides
redirection / pipes just like UNIX) etc. etc. etc. and code to expand
wildcards in the command line (so PROGRAM B:*.C will get an argv / argc
that you'd expect - with all the filenames in it).

In addition, there is a Z-system version (all comes in the same
package - it's four disks all up: DSDD, so if you've got a Kaypro 2
or an Osborne1, you are in for a real surprise), that supports named
directories, and a whole raft of other Z-features.

However, the real cat's whiskers is CDB. Apart from the fact that it
doesn't show the source code from within the debugger, I found it about
as good as DBX / CDB under UNIX. You have statement level execution
control - it even understands that:

	a = 5; b = strlen(fudge);

is two statements, and will execute them as separate steps. You have
named access to your local and global variables, and useable expression
evaluation. _AND_ for those that really want to see the source from
within the debugger (I sure as hell would like it :-) ) the source
_OF_ CDB is provided, so you can hack it. Of course, it makes a sizeable
dent in your TPA, using typically 20-25K, but for debugging C programs
it's a whole lot more civilised than ZSID.

You also get RED, a text editor which can be set up to "eat" an error
file produced by the compiler, and show you what you did wrong in the
compilation. This is a fair text editor, and again source is provided.
From what I saw of it, it's quality stands up beside CDB and the
compiler package in general, my main reason for not using it is it's
size (something like 40K) and my familiarity with my current editor.
However from a reviewers perspective, I would say RED is a well written
editor, and due to it's configurability can be adjusted to suit anyone's
tastes.

All in all I would rate this as a very good compiler indeed, well worth
the money.

-- 
I have no connection with BD Software, who wrote the BDS-C system;
nor with Sage Microsystems East, from whom I purchased it.

I just think it's a damn good package.

	"Checking to see if a word is spelled correctly (based on the
	dictionary) seems fairly simple, but I also would like to have
	it suggest correct spellings for misspelled words. Does anyone
	know of a good way to do that?"

The approach used in the spelling corrector component of the Unica(tm)
utility set was to look through a (separate) dictionary of commonly
misspelled words, which includes the correct spelling:

	mispell:misspell
	seperate:separate

etc.  Any hit is an unconditional misspelling, and the utility suggests
the replacement word to the user.

When other processing finds a misspelled word (a word isn't in the
dictionary, it asks the user if it's right, the user says no), then it
asks for a replacement and adds an entry to the misspelled-word
dictionary.  After a few weeks, the user's commonly misspelled words
are pretty much all in there.

A Xerox CP/M system inherently looks like either an ADM-3A (for -I) or
*almost* an ADM-31 for the -II.

Better yet, fix your UN*X termcap for the following Xerox and Kaypro
entries:

----

I faked out the standout/standend modes in the -I since I think that blinking
characters suck.  Emacs wants them regardless.  Oh, and the 820p is for
UPGRADED ROM only since the generic 820-I does not support insert line/delete
line.  There are several places that sell Xerox upgrade ROMs.

Hope this helps!

  I believe the Osborne support anything beyond 2400 baud without some serious internal work.  Of course, I could be wrong, it's been awhile since I've played with my Ozzie...
