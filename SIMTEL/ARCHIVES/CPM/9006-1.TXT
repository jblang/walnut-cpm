Of course, the only reason you can get 765s like that is because IBM used
the 765. Noone wants to build new x79x chips anymore, since they would be
incompatible with the IBM market.

Message-ID: <9006041822.AA15335@wugate.wustl.edu>

Help!

I would like to daisy chain an 8-inch floppy drive unit to the 8-inch rigid
drive connected to my XEROX 820-2. I know where the floppy drive cable has
to be plugged into the back of the rigid drive unit.  However, my XEROX
manuals indicate that both the floppy drive and rigid drive units must be
internally modified in order for this to work.

Can anyone out there please explain to me what I have to do internally to
both disk drive units in order to daisy chain them?

As long as I am at it, there is one more question.  A XEROX 820-2 with two
floppy drives comes with a baby board which serves as the floppy disk
controller.  An 820-2 with a rigid drive unit has a different baby board
used to interface with the floppy and rigid disk controller located inside
the rigid drive assembly.  Can I modify a XEROX 820-2 to work with another
type of drive by simply swapping the baby boards, or is there more to it?

Thanks for any information you can provide,

Message-ID: <MaOh8Dq00W0NI8b3gl@andrew.cmu.edu>

First-

Huge thanks to all of you who are willing to help me and my Dad get this
darmblasted machine to actually be of some use(no offense to all of you
CP/Mers, but I am used to Macs and Unix -- this is evil!).  I have gotten
back to some of you and will still be calling on the help of others.

Next-

I was home again this weekend and the printing (which worked last weekend)
has suddenly decided that it doesn't want to work.  The "test" function still
works off-line, so it isn't the printer (which is a little mannesman thingy).
I tried to print using TeleWrite and TWP with many different text files on
several different disks.  It always goes about half way through the print
cysle and then it freezes.  Only a reboot seems to help here.

Can someone give me an idea of what to check for (the physical connections
seem to be fine)?  I really don't know anything about this and my Dad knows
a lot less.
He and I would greatly appreciate it if someone could tell me what kind
of problem this sounds like.

Thanks in advance!

I've run across something puzzling and perhaps someone could explain it
to me? I'm using David Goodenough's UUCP21 under CP/M Plus (a Morrow
Decision's 11) - the collected messages (the .MAI files) are added to
when new uucp packets come in, no problem; the problem is that somehow
the access timestamp isn't changed even though the file is altered.
Are CP/M+ timestamps not changed for random read/write BDOS calls, just
for sequential read/write BDOS calls or it there another explanation?
Thanks, larry moore

I too have wondered how to do that, but do not know how to do it (yet).  It
is not addressed in the Xerox 820 Technical Reference manual at all.  I
will forward your message on to the 820 Users Group dl here at Xerox.
There are some new members, and maybe one of them knows.  Send me your
Email address.

As to the 820-II daughter boards, I am not sure what your getting at, but
there is one daughter for the rigid drive, and one for 8"/5" floppy disk
drives.  Swapping back in forth is as simple as plugging them in and
attaching the correct drive.  Just *DON'T* get them mixed up (Drive and
card).  You *WILL* blow the hard drive controller board inside the drive
cabenet if you attach it to the Floppy controller daughter board, and they
are damn near impossible to replace.

If you need a floppy controller daughter board, let me know.

I got an old S100 box running, just to let it blink the lights and run MuMath.

It has a Disk Jockey 2D/B Rev 4 controller with eprom at 0xE000.

MuMath is just crippled with this little ram.

Can anyone supply the address decoding prom, labelled 3D or DJ2-3D, the eprom,
labelled B/V2 E000 D987, or the modified cbios, all to run at 0xF800 instead?

I can't justify paying much, I am embarrassed to admit what I paid for parts
of the system over the years.  I can promise the parts a good home and will
keep it running.

I would also consider "intersting" S100 boards with documentation/software
and try get them running again.

please reply by email

Subject: CP/M software source / some FDC notes
Message-ID: <2710@wrgate.WR.TEK.COM>

Lately there have been a few requests for "where can I get ....."
There is at least one company that still proudly proclaims
"World's #1 CP/M Products Supplier." 

	Central Computer Products
	330 Central Avenue
	Fillmore, CA 93015
	(805)524-4189

They still sell C/NIX, C/80, GRAMMATIK, spreadsheet programs, games,
and much more. For $3 they will send you a catalog. I have no
connection with them (except as a very satisfied customer.)


Now to change the subject. I though I'd chip in my two cents worth on
the Western Digital disk controllers are better/worse that the 765 FDC
discussion. Some people may have already discovered that a disk
formatted via a Western controller sometimes cannot be read by a 765.
This is because the Western disk controllers format 10 bytes of FF and
6 bytes of 00 in gap 2 while the 765 formats 11 bytes of FF and 6 bytes
of 00 (as per the standard.) This difference can cause the 765 to miss
the data address mark. Whether or not this happens depends on how good
the PLL is. The Western controllers, having shorted the gap, enable the
PLL earlier. The 765 does not know the gap is substandard short and so
does not enable the PLL in time.

My 765 also can have trouble reading the first sector on a track when
the disk is formatted on a foreign system. The 765 is sensitive to the
location of the index pulse w.r.t. that first sector. My fix to this
problem is: when I find such a disk, I enable a Flip-Flop on my
controller card to divide-by-two the incoming index pulses. This causes
two revolutions per index pulse and on the second pass, where there is
no index pulse, the 765 reads the first sector just fine.

My favorite editor is ZDE 1.3.  I like it because it interfaces
well with ZCPR3.x.  But it will (or at least should) work fine
under vanilla CP/M.  I also like it because it's a quick editor
because everything is RAM-resident, but that will limit the length
of your edit file to something like 40K, but there are special chop
utilities that will allow you to break a large file down into
smaller chunks.  But I also find it easy to use.  As for programs
that edit larger files, I haven't had any luck yet finding a file
that will fit that bill nicely.  But VDE and ZDE are good starters
until you can find a more suitable editor.  Have fun, and happy
hunting!

Hello All --

A friend brought a Kaypro II by the house for repair.  It would not boot.
I got it going, but was surprised to discover that it has single-sided
drives (something around 190 K per drive).  This is the first time I've
ever touched a "real-live" Kaypro.  Can this be upgraded to DSDD??  A
DSDD Kaypro is not a bad machine, but this thing would seem to have limited
usefullness.  Anybody know if the ROM upgrades sold by MicroC/Emerald (were
they MicroCode??) will work on a machine like this??  I have applied their

Is there a way to subscribe to this list directly rather than to a distribution
list to get digests?  I would like to get the messages as soon as they arrive
rather than getting a digest every now and then.  I thought it was strange when
I see replys to messages that are in the same digest.  That must mean that
there is a way to subscribe directly.  I am currently subscribed to DIST-CPM
through LISTSERV@RPIECS on Bitnet.  I would appreciate any help.  Thanks.

    I bought this card over the weekends, so now I'm trying to look for 
some documentation.  The on board rom has a marking "boot 8080 or 8086",
does this mean that this board can be use to boot up either CPM-80 or CPM-86

I like Vedit+ for this and other reasons.  I've edited files 200K
in length, and while it could get sluggish during reads/writes to
floppies, it worked very nicely.  It's also very configurable, and
has a TECO-like macro language (some may not consider this to be
a feature).

I've used VEDIT from CompuView for about 10 years.  They are mostly
concentrating on their MS-DOS version now, but still sell the CP/M one
(at least they did about a year ago).  It allows multiple files to be
edited at one time, multiple windows on screen, files can be any size
that will fit on your disk, works with almost any terminal, etc.  It
also has an incredibly powerful command language (very much like TECO).
It is not free, but considering the fact that the most time you spend
at your computer is in the editor (unless you are playing games), and
that I believe good tools are important, it seems worth the price to
me.

Note: as usual, no link between CompuView and me.  Just a satisfied
customer (with a little pride that the editor I picked so long ago
when Ted Green was still working in his basement turned out so well).

Yes, there was. But I will try to keep order.

There is a CMOS-Z80 available with 10 MHz for some time now, and this spring
they offered a 20 MHz version. As the Z80 peripherals (also CMOS) only speed
up to 10 MHz, this is only of interest if someone uses TTL-only peripherals
(think of embedded control).

The Z180 (or the identical HD 64180) is an upward compatible MPU with at this
time max. 10 MHz clock. However, it is about 25% faster than a 10 MHz Z80,
cause the M1 cycle lasts only 3 clocks (instead of 4). The MPU contains two
UARTs, two 16-bit-Timer/Counters, two DMA controllers, and a simple banked
MMU for 1 MB addressing space. Bus size still 8 bits. Adds a few instructions
to the Z80 command set (non-destructive AND, and 8x8 bit unsigned multiply).

Z280 is the latest offspring of Zilog's 8-Bit crew. It is also Z80 compatible
but not Z180 compatible. Clock frequency 10 MHz (standard), will go in
quantities with 12.5 MHz in 3Q90. It has a pipelined CPU so speed comparison
depends on the application. With standard CP/M programs, it is a little bit
faster than the Z180 at the same clock (using 16-bit bus). This MPU contains
only one UART, three 16-bit-T/C's, four DMA-controllers, a 256-byte cache,
and a complex paged MMU for 16 MB. It can be configured for 8-bit-Z80-Bus mode,
or for 16-bit-Z-Bus mode (the Z8000 bus). Instruction set is about twice as
big as that of Z80, the new instructions include signed & unsigned multiply
& divide for bytes & words, and very powerful new addressing modes (base index,
register index, for example). It also supports System and User Modes, with
different MMU pages and different privileges.

Both Z180 and Z280 have programmable bus timing (wait state generators), but
the Z280 is the more flexible one.

As a plug-in replacement for the Z80, neither of them is useable. But, you
could adapt them both via some little PCB. Both MPU's are housed in PLCC-68
cases, the Z180 is also available in 64-pin shrink dip. Of course if you do
that, the Z280 cannot be driven in Z-Bus mode.

Perhaps you simply contact Zilog and let them send you some data sheets.

However, if you are interested in a new computer system with the Z280,
please contact me (as I just finished design of my single-board Z280 computer).

 How do you go about ordering CPM for the C128, more specifically through
who and what is the address ??

 Also, I recall that the C128 in earlier CPM versions was supposed to be able
to read other CPM formats (haven't tried it yet), but has this changed ??

  Finally, does anyone have a working version of kermit and/or Xmodem for the
C128 under CPM, or any other modem program for that matter ??

thanks in advance...

Message-ID: <5776@balu.UUCP>

Hello everybody!

Lately, I bought a copy of WordStar, CP/M Edition, Release 4. As the delivered
printer drivers (incl. CUSTOM and SIMPLE) do not fit my needs, I would like to
write a new one which does.

The WSCHANGE program offers a function 'add new driver', which expects some
driver file of the type '.DRV'. 
However, there is *NO* documentation about format and software interface of
these '.DRV' files, nor about file format and spec's of the drivers itself,
nor about the complete WSPRINT.OVR file.

I wrote to the MicroPro Customer Service in San Rafael, but I got no answer
at all. The german MicroPro office didn't even know of WS 4 for CP/M.

Can anybody help with detailed information?
(or even supply e-mail contact address of MicroPro)
Thanks in advance.

I like the text editor of Borland's Turbo Pascal v2 for CP/M, which
can only be used within Turbo Pascal. Under Turbo Pascal V3 and higher
it does exist as a separately editor, for the PC anyway, but does it
also exist for plain CP/M ? Furthermore, I believe it is
called the "microstar editor", but I am not sure of it.

I know you said 'preferrably public domain' but I had to install my $.02
American in here. It's old and it's been upgraded a LOT since 1983 but I
am using WordStar 3.3 on my Molecular Mod. 9. I've used it for
everything from letter writing to writing code for the basic compiler to
chew on and have found it easy to get along with and awful hard to
break. Add to that that it's installable for a wide selection of
printers and terminals and it fills the need nicely. If you ever find a
set of disks for it with the manuals at a reasonable price, I think it
would be worth the $$$ to buy it. BTW, I haven't run into any problems
with files to large for it either. 

Here's hoping I don't start a WP war here (my WP is better than YOUR
WP!) :-)

Where were you guys when I needed info on the Xerox rigid drive? And
the controller?  I have a BRAND NEW drive and SA1400 controller in my
basement that I can't use, since I have no data on either, except for
the Shugart glossy on the controller, and the Shugart foldout on their
8" products.  The shipping blocks are still in place on the drive. I just
removed the cables as the box was new.  The box holds a pair of 8" drives
now, although that took some surgery, and I'm willing to part with the 
SA1004, the SA1400 and the SA850 that came in the box for cheep.  Any takers?
My wife will love you for it!

Does anyone out in CP/M land have any knowledge about an HP 125 series 100 
computer?  My wife's school has just been given an HP 'terminal' (i.e. it looks
like a standard HP Terminal).  It has markings on the front that it is a 125
Series 100.  It comes with a standard HP9121D disk drive, has on the rear 
panel several interface plugs, HPIB, RS-232, what looks like a centronics 
interface connector and the standard HP terminal connector.  

Central Computer's catalog says the HP125 is a CP/M system, but I am not sure
what this is.  If anyone has one of these systems, and a boot disk that I could
get to try, I would greatly appreciate the assistance.

Please contact me at the electronic address below.

Roger,
      I recently finished upgrading an old Kaypro II to a Kaypro 8 by
doing the same type of thing which your refering. Micro-Cornucopia has
ROM upgrades available to upgrade a II to a 4 or 8 at a very reasonable
price. The bad news is that they're going out of business.. so if you
want one you'd better order it now. I assume that Dave Thompson will
probably still have them available through his brothers company (Micro-
Sphere in Bend,OR) even after Micro-C goes under. By ording a PRO8 ROM
from them and doing a few hardware mods you can add up to 4 DSDD
40 trk 48tpi (360k) drives to the machine and give it the ability to run
at 5 Mhz clock rate. I put 4 half height Teac FD55s in mine and love it.

BTW: When you call them be sure and use the
standard number as the 800 number has been disconnected. I beleive they
are in the office from 10am til 2pm PDT M-F unless they've shut down
already.

As for a comparison to the 820-1.. yes, it is worth it. The 820-1 and
the Kaypro II are almost identical machines at the motherboard level.
Only a few minor differences in the disk controller area seperate them.
As far as this goes, the Kaypro is a superior machine since it already
has a WD 1593 for a disk controller chip (and is thus able to do DD
with only minor hardware modification). The Xerox requires replacement
of the controller chip and some mods to the data seperator circuit in-
order to do double density as well as a clock rate speed change.

To sum up.. I'd recommend the conversion process. It requires some work
on your part, and you have to be handy with a soldering iron, but it's
cheap and yields a superior machine.                TWYL  Bill

The DISK2 (which is what you have) will boot either Compupro CP/M-80
or CP/M-86. The boot sequence was somewhat specific to Compupro hardware
though, since it used a call to the the dual processor cpu board (bring-
ing the 8088/86 alive to do block moves in memory). Consequently, unless
you have a Compupro dual processor cpu board.. you may have to re-write
some of the ROM boot code.

Compupro is still around.. They are called Viasyn Corp. and are located
in Hayward CA.

While it's not public domain, Central Computer Products does sell
MYCHESS for $31. It is rated at approximately 1550 (I forgot the exact
rating.) Their address is:

	330 Central Avenue
	Fillmore, CA 93015
	(805)524-4189

Their catalog costs $3; It's clear form their low prices that it would
be difficult to make money and give it away. I have no connection with
them other than a satisfied customer.

Subject: CP/M on CBM 8032?
Message-ID: <5865@helios.TAMU.EDU>

A friend of mine has acquired a couple CBM 8032 computers and restored
them to operating condition.  (The 8032 is a glorified PET w/ 80 column
display.)  He recently acquired a board which is apparently a CP/M board
for this machine.  It was manufactured by Madison [WI] Computer around 1981
and is called a ZRAM board.  It has two Z80a chips in it, and an MC6812 
chip, as well as several small chips that appear to be RAM chips.  He
has the board installed but with no documentation, can't get the 6502
to go to sleep and allow the Z80 to run.  (In addition, he has no software
for it.)  My question:  Is there someone out there who is familiar with
this board and can point us in the right direction to acquire some
software? 

(I posted a similar request in comp.sys.cbm but got no response.  Any
lead, no matter how minute, would be greatly appreciated.)

Message-ID: <1938@aurora.cs.athabascau.ca>

I am using Word Star 4.0 with a Diablo 1650 word processing printer which I
use with the WS Diablo print driver.

All goes well most of the time but every once in a while a document will not
print without errors: the errors are always identical and in the same place,
stopping the flow of data (to ensure that the buffer is not overflowing) does
not change the symptoms, and errors are more likely to appear in large files
but they can be as easily at the beginning as the end.

I have three possible suspects: an inappropriate printer driver, a
defective printer, and hardshelled insects.

I am presently examining the entymological angle.

What are the known WS4.0 bugs and their solutions?

Some time ago, there was an item in this digest from someone seeking software
for the Coleco ADAM computer (out of production).  I have written a program
which enables file and sector level communication between the ADAM and IBM
compatibles via 5 1/4" floppy.

The program is now available in ADAMDISK.ARC on the San Diego Computer Society
BBS.  This file includes the Turbo Pascal source code, .COM file, and a .DOC
file describing the software and general info on the ADAM.  The program runs
on IBM compatibles, and includes a disk edit function similar to Norton
Utilities.  The entire .ARC file is offered for public use at no charge.

The SDCS BBS operates 24 hours at (619) 549-3788 (2400 N81).

Views expressed are my own.

     What you have here is half of a Compupro Disk 2 HD controller.  Their
first one was a two-board set, the DISK 2 and the SELECTOR CHANNEL.

     I'm a bit hazy about the function of ech board of the pair, but the
DISK 2 board carries the connectors for the hard drive(s).

     The ROM on the SELECTOR CHANNEL will appear at your processor reset
address, wherever that happens to be.

     You do NOT need the CPU 85/88, contrary to what someone else has said.
The board has a jumper contolling which half of the ROM is enabled.  Set it
one way, and the boot routine is 8-bit ( i.e. 8080 ).  Set it the other way
and you have a 16-bit boot.

     The SELECTOR CHANNEL board was the smarts for the board set.  It's a
channel controller, like the IBM mainframes.  You leave it commands in
memory, then bump its attention port.  This caused it to come out, get the
IOPB ( I/O parameter Block ), and tell the controller what to do.

     It's an IEEE DMA device, capable of transferring 64k of data at a time,
across 64k boundaries.  Supposedly pretty fast, too.

     Oh, this beast was a SA-1000 ( 8" ) controller, not ST-506 compatible
( although you supposedly could get CompuPro to fix you up one that was
ST-506 ).

     Compupro is Viasyn now.  No buyout, or anything like that... they just
changed their name.  They can be reached at 415-782-2481.

     Note that they no longer manufacture the board, and that their current
operating systems no longer support it ( except for CP/M-80 ).

     I have no connection with Compupro/Viasyn other than being a very
satisfied customer.  My S-100 is all Compupro.

I understand that it is limited to 512K. This from a friend who
had to edit a 1.5MB database, of which 1MB vanished upon exiting
WS. Apparently, the convention for handling files over 512K
involved a different section of the directory entry, and WS
didn't (and probably still doesn't) know about it.

I used to use Vedit; it was supposed to handle a file half the
size of the drive (had to create the temp file....).

Cory, you misunderstood.  We're still here.  Funding prematurely ran
out for the full-time maintenance of the CP/M and MSDOS collections
for the rest of this FY - i.e., until the end of September.  The
collections remain where they are, and BITNET access through RPIECS
and NDSUVM1, and other continue on as they were.  We expect at least
a minimum level of funding to resume the tasks, beginning in October.
There are no guarantees, and TANSTAAFL.

Hmmmmm.. Thanks for the warning Gary. I doubt I'll be working with files that
size since I use it mostly for writing code and the modules never get quite
THAT big but it's still nice to know....

I'm reading mentions of FW and PD editors myself. Always interested in
what else is available even though WS has become second nature. Presents
problems in my Unix environment though. uEmacs doesn't know what to make
of ^KS^QP :-)

Are there any CP/M editors with MACROS?  A simple map mechanism as 
in vi (even without the @ apply operator) would be good enough.

I was using the MicroCornucopia Editor for a while.  I have Wordstar 3.3,
but that's overkill for my use.

Once I started using VDE 2.66, I havent gone back to the MicroCornucopia
Editor.  Its kind of a shame, because its such a nice editor.  I wont
get rid of it, thats for sure.

Is MicroCornucopia still around?  What are they like?

I don't know what the Micro-C editor is like, but I have used WS
3.3, and 4.0.  I prefer 4.0 because of its extended printer
drivers.

I tried VDE 2.66, but I had problems using it.  I prefer ZDE 1.3
mainly because it works with my ZCPR33 system.  Plus, like I said
in earlier posts, I can also use it with vanilla CP/M.  And I have,
too.

> Is MicroCornucopia still around?  What are they like?

I don't know what they are like (rather were).  As for their being
in business or not, Micro-C just met its demise.

Hi...
I am using a SIEMENS PC 16-11 that runs also under CCP/M-86. It has
two 720 K Drives and a 32 MB Harddisk (:-) ). There is not very much
of PD-Software, but i have a few compilers , which came from Digital-
Research. I phoned to DR to get newer Versions, but DR doesn't sell
these Compilers or any other Software for CCPM-86 anymore...
So I think they are PD, or not? The software i wrote for this machine
uses features of the Siemens, so i think, it will not run on your
machine...
But if you want to look for it...

If you would be interested, I could email you an EEencoded .ARC file of the
ADAMDISK program I recently announced.  I have no idea how to get it to SIMTEL
from here, but thought that might be a good place for it to end up.  If you
have any comments or ideas, I'd appreciate hearing from you.

At present, I have 3 files for ADAMDISK: .COM, .PAS, .DOC - and in addition I
wrote another program last nite: ADAMAKER.COM in debug.  It will take a PC or
MS-DOS single sided 8 sector/track disk, and make it into a bootable ADAM
"DOS" Disk Manager disk.  I made this one in response to local requests from
people who have ADAMs, and who damaged or lost their ADAM disks.  The program
would be of no real use to anyone who doesn't own an ADAM with disk drive.

Please let me know if you'd like me to email any of these files to you in UUE
format.  Thanks for your help.

They are not. Copyright (not to mention the insane license agreement)
does not expire when something is no longer sold. When a publisher 
quits printing a book, does it's copyright expire? You might call
DR and ask if they'll permit you to make copies on a no-profit 
basis, or if they'll release it (hahaha....) into public domain.
(Remember, these people wanted $350 for CP/M-86, which is why 
everyone wrote for the $60 PC-DOS.)

Probably true, but the source code would be a great starting 
point for someone else....

22DISK by Sydex is a great shareware product that converts, formats,
and copies CP/M <-> DOS for a huge number of CP/M machines. The

You could try 22DISK from Sydex -- it's shareware, and can be downloaded
from most bulletin boards.

Frank,
 
Thanks for clearing up the fact that SIMTEL-20 is not gone for our purposes.
But I'm still somewhat confused about it.  Do you just mean that because of the
budget cut that it is not long maintained full time but that it is once in a
while and that we can still get the stuff from it that was already there?  You
mentioned still being able to get to it via RPIECS, etc. but can we still FTP

The LaserJet should have several emulation modes that WS can recognize
one of. Almost certainly, it'll have a Epson clone and may even have
a 630 clone...

level format that I never saw before, and would like to understand.  I
doubt this old drive is big enough by today's standards to be much force.

Anyway, what I got was this: there is a lever on the side of the drive
connected to the head stepper, so one can "see" the heads move.  At the
start of formatting, I put my finger lightly on this lever, hearing and
feeling the step, step, as I expected; except the lever did not move for
128 steps.  Then it would move forward.  

It seemed to be trying to move backward past track zero for the first
128 times, in other words.  The gold-plated question is: why?  In case 
I bump up against this again, I'd like to know.

And, I suppose if I really expect to use the drive, I need to know the
total number of cylinders, heads, starting reduced write current and 
write precomp cylinder.  Anyone have a chart of Seagate drive specs, or
know where I could call or write to get this data?

It's amazing how much power these old drives eat!  This one's more quiet
than I remember these old full-height drives as being, though.

Cheers.

  Someone already HAS orted EMacs (kinda) over to 2.2 - it's available
(I should say "KIND of available"!) as either Mince (you can get it from)
C Users Group in Kansas - needs BDS-C to compile), Perfect Writer (can't
buy it legally anymore, but...), or Pmate (ditto on the buy it business).
  Mince is emacs-LIKE.  You get the identical command structure, but
the macro facility is limited.  There is no toggling between command mode,
and text entry, it's basically text entry, and you can make a one-line
macro (but you can't SAVE your macros).
  Perfect Writer is the same as Scribble.  All Perfect did was to combine
SMince and Scribble (a formatter) along with a menu and a spell-checker, and
call the whole ting Perfect{ Writer.
  OTOH, Pmate DOES let you toggle between command and text-entry mode.
  I understand it's not being sold anymore, but have seen some traffic
about it being made available as Zmate (Pmate that understands Z3).

Hi,

I just bought a DEC Rainbow for a bargain price and would
like to use it as an intelligent terminal from my home.
Rainbow has a terminal mode, but it does not seem to be
intelligent (i.e. up and downloading files from the host,
using the programming features of the modem, etc.). What
I need is a good terminal program. I have no technical
documentation necessary for writing one. Does anybody
have a terminal program for Rainbow?
Another question is: Does anybody have software for
reading/writing PC 360K floppies on Rainbow? Rainbow
has MS-DOS and 400K floppies - it must be technically
possible.
Any other tips for a beginning owner?
Thanks for your responses,

Marek

I'd like to start off by thanking these kind folks for their help:

Brian Kantor <brian@ucsd.edu>
Alex Nghiem <nghiem@emx.utexas.edu>
Ed Grey <ac959@cleveland.freenet.edu> 
Larry Jones <scjones@sdrc.uu.net>
Dave Goodman <daveg@usource.sarasota.fl.us>
Kevin Strietzel <kevin@cs.arizona.edu>

Seems there *are* still people who remember old hard disk drives :-)!

I not only have complete specs on the ST-506 now, but a WD BBS that
has other drive type info too.

OK, Brian informs me that an XT-GEN controller is able to handle drives
with buffered seeks only, and the ST-506 is too stupid to be able to do
this (makes sense, you ought to see the old stuff on this thing's servo
board).

So, I have an IBM XT controller that *will* work, BUT...

There's no way to start a low-level format!  Does anyone have, or know
where to get, a formatter for these original IBM controllers?

Please don't tell me to call IBM; trust me, they could not possibly care
less about this old stuff!  I know, because I have dealt with them in the 
past.  If I can't find a real live person with some hacker blood, I'll be
out of luck on this one.

Yes, it vibrates a PClone keyboard through the table enough to make the

   In terminal mode, it is a VT102 with a funny keyboard.  Period.

   There are good versions of kermit and all the usual other things 
available for this machine.  Most of them provide VT10x emulation, with 
some ability to use the bigger keyboard, and whatever file transfer things 
come with them.  These should be in the archives.

   Not a chance.  That cute little diskette drive you are looking at--into 
which both diskettes go "write side out", has only one motor and one set of 
heads *per diskette*.  So, it is 400Kb single-sided, in its own unique 
format.  There is software around that will run on AT-class MessDOS 
machines that use 1.2Mb floppies that will write and read the Rainbow 80 
track single sided format (we've had pretty good success with MediaMaster 
(tm)).  And you should note that the Rainbow has special firmware that 
permits it to read *single-sided* standard PC diskettes (180K), which can 
be recorded on any PC.  It can sort of write them, too, subject to the 
restrictions about writing on a narrow-headed machine for a wide-headed 
machine (e.g., the diskette should be *very* blank before you start, but 
formatted on the wide-headed machine).  Reading doesn't take anything 
special, just format the disks single sided in the IBM environment, write 
on them, put the diskette into the Rainbow, and read or copy as usual.
  But there is no way to read or write an IBM 360K diskette on the 
Rainbow--not enough heads in the right places.  And no way to write or read 
Rainbow diskettes on an IBM 360K drive--not enough tracks.
  Various third-party vendors make, or used to make, IBM-compatible 360Kb
drives that could be attached to the Rainbow, but they are--or used to be--
sufficiently expensive that parking an IBM clone next to the Rainbow as a 
diskette device and running a serial wire between them was often a more 
cost-effective solution.

Subject: MNP level 4 to MNP level 5

I am using an EMEX 2400EC modem which supports MNP level 4.
Whenever I call to an HST modem with MNP level 5 I cannot
connect with error correction (MNP).  It is my belief that when
2 modems that support MNP are attempting to connect, they should
step down until they reach a level of MNP that is supported by
both modems.

I can connect to PC-Pursuit with MNP error correction and they
only support up to level 3.  I can also cause PC-P's outdial
modems connect to an HST (MNP level 5) modem.  I just cannot
make my modem connect directly with an HST (level 5).  Any
suggestions?

MNP, up to level 4, is supposed to useful in using modems over
dirty phone lines.  Sometimes my line get quite noisy and it
would be useful to be able to use this feature.  Thanks in
advance.

NOTE: The modem is manufactured by INCOMM DATA SYSTEMS, INC. and
I'm using it on a TeleVideo TS803H CP/M system.

Message-ID: <AaVvLym00W0NJ1=29Q@andrew.cmu.edu>

Hello all --

I posted a problem before where my father suddenly couldn't print anything
on his Televideo (CP/M 2.2) and line printer.  I was told to try PIP to
see where the problem was.  First, the machine says there is not enough
memory for this, although PIP is on the system software disk that came with
the machine.  Anyway, all of the sudden, the danm thing prints.  Is this
possibly dependent on the order that the two machines are turned on (printer
and computer)?  A friend suggested that one may need to be on in order to
init the other to it's existance.  This makes sense, but I am not sure it
is true in this case.  Does anyone know if this could actually have been the
problem and, if so, which needs to be turned on first?

Thank you very much.
Please e-mail to me; don't post.

Jacques,
       Have you tried Computer Surplus Store? They have the 4000A in
stock for a quite reasonable price. Call them at 1-408-434-0377 for
the latest pricing info.. but I think they were around $90. (BTW: I
am not affiliated with CSS or making any advertising claim on this other
than my personal experience in previously purchasing one from them.)
I hope this information is useful..

Message-ID: <9006291158.aa26365@CRDEC2.APGEA.ARMY.MIL>

dBaseII does still exist.  Ashton-Tate has a stock of version 2.43* that is 
only in need of a dealer to handle it for us to be able to get it for our
CP/M machines.  I have, by hook and crook, obtained a new copy of version 
2.43*.  I hope we can come out with a sales organization to enable CP/Mers
to continue using this fine product. 

I have been in contact with a supplier who will supply to US Government related
users, and have been informed that they will supply it as long as Ashton-Tate
has it in stock.  Stephanie Wright of A-T says it is in stock, and has, as I 
said, supplied me with a copy.  If you are interested, and are in any way 
connected with Uncle Sam (including some University or Educational 
organizations), contact GTSI at (703) 631-3333.  GTSI will supply even small
quantities to Government related organizations while they can get it.  

If your use is non-government, contact Ashton-Tate's Customer Relations
Department at (213)329-9989.  If we can get a CP/M related organization to 
handle the sales, we may be able to reopen the supply.  

My lunches have been used up trying to open this channel of other CP/Mers.
I think it is a well that is worth trying to tap.

1) Is there some way to tell wordstar to shut up when it starts?  I get
three screens and two delays before I'm allowed to type anything.  I
*hate* that.  Same thing with my modem program (bw111).  It gives
screens-full of startup messages and wants to interact with me all the
time.  I want to tell *it* what to do, not be prompted by long-winded,
*slow* delays and screen-fulls of prompts!

2) What wordstar or other edit macros do you use most?

MS-DOS terminal programs for the Rainbow can be obtained by Anonymous
FTP from Drycas.Club.CC.CMU.EDU, directory [ANONYMOUS.INFO-DEC-MICRO.COMM].

Don't try getting them by Email; it doesn't work.

CP/M Kermit is also available for the Rainbow; other CP/M terminal
programs held on Simtel20 should also be configurable for it.
The CPM Users' Group years ago had a whole disk of Rainbow
communications software which might be somewhere in PD2:<CPM.CUG> on
Simtel20.
