Message-ID: <90092.133733HDK@psuvm.psu.edu>

If anyone out there is running CPM and Kermit on an Epson QX-10,
there's a professor emeritus here who's been trying to use the
Columbia source to generate himself a version. He's having trouble
getting Kermit to recognize his serial port, although other software
he has does not have this trouble.

Could anyone shed any light on this problem, or better yet send suggested
Kermit source changes (CPS*.*, CPX*.* files) to HDK@PSUVM.PSU.EDU.
                                                          Many thanks.

Macro-80 should work just fine (more commonly known as M80.COM). You'll
also need L80.COM to go with it to line the *.REL output files. M80 is
probably the best all around Z80 assembler I've used. It's syntax and
error messages can be a bit cryptic at times, but it's fast and has a
great macro processor built in. M80 was sold by Microsoft, but more than
likely, is probably now unsupported. If you look around at fleamarkets,
hamfests, and in the FidoNet FORSALE echos you should be able to pick
up a copy at a reasonable price.

    I recently purchased a computer at an auction and am trying to get some

I believe it might be a CPM system.  Does anybody out there know anything

system disk for it (by the way, it uses 3-1/2" disks).  Also, some information
on what kind of keyboard will work with it (the keyboard port uses a modular

Message-ID: <JFL23EGxds7@ficc.uu.net>

     I have recently aquired a Sequa Chameleon Plus (no manuals) which
     appears to be an early IBM-PC clone.  From looking at the main
     board I see that it has the following features:

          o  8088 CPU running at 4.77 MHz
          o  8087 Math coprocessor
          o  Z80 CPU (for running CP/M?)
          o  256K memory with parity (36 4164 DRAMs)
          o  16K memory (2 4416 DRAMs) 
                (not sure what these are for, maybe display memory)
          o  NEC765 floppy controller
          o  6845 CRT controller 
                (seems to be CGA resolution, have not tried graphics)
          o  1 printer port
          o  2 serial ports
                (must be nonstandard since there are no 8250s on the board)
          o  1 game port
          o  1 IEEE-488 (GPIB) port
                (there are 8291/2/3s on the board)

     It can boot Compaq MSDOS 3.1 just fine but I can't get much of
     anything to run on it due to its lack of memory.  It does reboot
     when I exit Compaq Basic with the SYSTEM command.  This must be a
     sign of some incompatabilty.  If the machine is compatable enough
     to make it worth while I plan to modify the board to support 256K
     DRAMs and have 640K on board (I have modified several old IBM-PC
     5-slot mother boards for 640K).

     I am looking for the following information on the machine:

         o  Just how compatable is it?  Does the hardware look like an
            IBM-PC to software?  How compatable is the BIOS?  Will I be
            able to run any useful IBM-PC programs on it?

         o  Is Sequa still in business?  Are there any manuals or
            schematics available?

         o  What is the purpose of the two 34 pin headers on the left
            side of the mother board?  Possibly an expansion bus?

     Please E-mail me if you have any information on this machine.

I have an issue of Popular Science from a number of years ago and
the Seequa (its proper spelling) Chameleon is capable of running
both DOS and CP/M, hence its name, the Chameleon.

I assume so you could put more floppy drives online, or possibly a
hard disk or two, or a combination thereof.

check out Processor Wars.  Or, optionally, I can make available,
transcripts of my logons.  Just drop me a line at the address

However, if you do make it to Hotel-86, and you want to leave hate

I think you meant assemblers, but I guess assemblers are almost the
same as compilers in their own way.  Anyway, to answer your
question, there are two that I know of, and those two are SLR's
Z80ASM which is a commercial program.  Then there's a package called
ZASM.LBR which is the Cromemco assembler, which is supposed to be a
rather nice, but slow, assembler.  If you have a copy of The
Computer Journal #35, there's an article on REL-type assemblers and
makes mention of it.

Subject: Z80 compilers

I got a Z80 assembler from a DEC machine in Marlboro, MA years ago when they
had a PD CP/M software repository there (to support their Rainbow and Robin
machines).  I forget the name of the system, but it was run by Bernie Eiben.
Anyways, they had an assembler called ZASM which assembled source files with
the .Z80 extension.  It came in a .LBR file with ZASM.COM and ZASM.DOC.
The .DOC file is quite extensive and describes the Z80 macro assembler.
Among other things, it can produce .HEX or .REL files, but I thought that some
of the pseduo-ops were either non-standard (not compatible with MAC/RMAC),
or had various non-standard forms.  When the assembler is invoked it claims to
be the "CROMEMCO Z80 Macro Assembler version 03.04".  I'm not sure if its been
put in the PD by CROMEMCO (before they went under), but Ernie was pretty good
about not keeping pirated software online.  Is this also on SIMTEL20?  I
thought that most of the software I found in Marlboro was also on SIMTEL20.

I have an issue of Popular Science from a number of years ago and
the Seequa (its proper spelling) Chameleon is capable of running
both DOS and CP/M, hence its name, the Chameleon.

I assume so you could put more floppy drives online, or possibly a
hard disk or two, or a combination thereof.

There's this guy who calls this board I call locally who is bashing
every processor that is not Intel, and has been recently bashing
CP/M.  For those of you folks who don't like this kind of
drag-in-the-mud treatment, call Hotel-86 at (916) 927-7680, and
check out Processor Wars.  Or, optionally, I can make available,
transcripts of my logons.  Just drop me a line at the address
below; that will be sent to my CP/M machine.

However, if you do make it to Hotel-86, and you want to leave hate
mail, leave it to "vEx" (actually, when the system prompts you to
enter the recipient's name, and you type it in, that system is case
insensitive).  To leave mail to me, leave it to "IJ".

I think you meant assemblers, but I guess assemblers are almost the
same as compilers in their own way.  Anyway, to answer your
question, there are two that I know of, and those two are SLR's
Z80ASM which is a commercial program.  Then there's a package called
ZASM.LBR which is the Cromemco assembler, which is supposed to be a
rather nice, but slow, assembler.  If you have a copy of The
Computer Journal #35, there's an article on REL-type assemblers and
makes mention of it.

Subject: Z80 compilers

I got a Z80 assembler from a DEC machine in Marlboro, MA years ago when they
had a PD CP/M software repository there (to support their Rainbow and Robin
machines).  I forget the name of the system, but it was run by Bernie Eiben.
Anyways, they had an assembler called ZASM which assembled source files with
the .Z80 extension.  It came in a .LBR file with ZASM.COM and ZASM.DOC.
The .DOC file is quite extensive and describes the Z80 macro assembler.
Among other things, it can produce .HEX or .REL files, but I thought that some
of the pseduo-ops were either non-standard (not compatible with MAC/RMAC),
or had various non-standard forms.  When the assembler is invoked it claims to
be the "CROMEMCO Z80 Macro Assembler version 03.04".  I'm not sure if its been
put in the PD by CROMEMCO (before they went under), but Ernie was pretty good
about not keeping pirated software online.  Is this also on SIMTEL20?  I
thought that most of the software I found in Marlboro was also on SIMTEL20.

Subject: Non-Intel Bashing...

Hmmmm.....

This is a serious matter, you see.

Personally, I think everything that Intel has ever come up with tend to
be rather demented; especially the iAPX86 family.  The segmentation system
is totally absurd.  The Queues on the lower processors are totally
mundane.  The processing time is totally outrageous.  The architecture
(the way they have the registers set up) makes absolutely no sense.

Aside from the compatibility, there is no reason why ANYONE should be
*%&('ing using any of Intel's higher-level processors.  Intel-compatible
op. codes are assembler programmers' worst nightmare - they are as
far away from natural language as humanly possible.

At least Zilog (although owned by Exxon) had the heart and the humaneness
enough to make sense out of the 8080/5 and create a more useful
(although subject to similar limitations) processors.

The step which Intel took from the 8080 family to iAPX432 was a
totally logical one - they found a fatal bug in 432 and had to pull
it out of production.  8086 makes as much sense as a pile of rocks
in the middle of Interstate 91.

I should admit that 8080 was the first very-commercially-successful
processor that popularized microcomputing, and 8086 family IS teh
most commercially successful one (although only at the consumer-product
level), I think there is a reason why:
   -people abandoned 8080 for Z80
   -people abandoned 8086 for 68000
   -people never thought of using 8086 where they are using 32000 and Z80,000
    these days.
(oops; I forgot a "but" in the paragraph above.)

Someone should come up with the guts and money to speed up Z80;
with current AS-TTL technology, we can pull it up to 100MHz!!!  Look
out Intel (Intel does, however, make some mean peripheral chips.)!

I still smile when I think of what the Intel salesperson must have
said when the order came in:

Sales: "Hello?"
IBM:   "We'd like to order some 8088 processors."
Sales: "Oh, the Coke Machine processor.  Sure, how many?"
IBM:   "Ten million."
Sales: "Ten million Coke Machine processors?  How many Coke Machines
        are you planning to build, anyway?"
IBM:   "We're not.  We're going to make a personal computer out of
        them."

        next week."

I believe that this got asked some time ago, but I can't find any
reference to it, so perhaps someone will be (ahem) good enough to
answer...

I've snarfed UUCP20I.LBR from the SIMTEL server, and unpacked it.
However, there are some files of the form *.DYC etc, which I gather is
some compressed format.  Nothing in the documentation kit (in
CPM.STARTER-KIT) seems to give any indication as to what is required to
uncompress it.  

So, what do I need to retrieve this time?  And while I have your
attention, is there anything else I need to know about the UUCP kit?
I guess it's all documented in the README.DYC file, once I finally
extract it...

Thanks for any replies, from a born-again CP/M lover...

I recently acquired an old Xerox 820-2 for the princely sum of $20, and
I was wondering about software, hardware, etc.

I have:

	Xerox 820-2
	Keyboard
	Dual 8" SD floppy drives (250K IBM format)
	Dial 5.25" ?D floppy drives (?format)
	Extra motherboard and some hardware in a box, along with
		some release notes for a hard-drive upgrade. No
		drive though. :-<
	Xerox CP/M 8" distribution disk.
	Select WordProcessor.
	Mountain View Press Forth.
	Various random things on 8" diskettes.

The system doesn't seem to support 8" and 5.25" drives at the same time:
at least there's nothing to daisychain them. It doesn't seem to have the
Double Density option installed, either. Anyone know where I can get a
Xerox 5.25" distribution disk? (does Xerox still sell them, and if so who
do I call?) How about the DD upgrade?

I'd also like to get Kermit on the 8" drives, so I can transfer stuff to
and from it. And a C compiler would be nice (:->).

This kind of file requires an uncruncher which uses the LZH
compression algorithm.  I will post it for you and the rest of the
world here.  You can also use it to uncrunch ?Z? (GEL algorithm)

Does anyone out there know whether the guy who wrote Megadisk
(which is on SIMTEL, and I snagged it) made Megadisk such that it
could format yet?  I would very much like to know.

Alternatively, does anyone know of some PD disk formatters for the

this very much.  Thanks in advance!

I have an NEC APC with a single 8" floppy and an external 10 meg
hard drive.  This is a CP/M-86 machine.

For some reason, very few programs will execute off of the hard drive.
I have had success with a few system programs, but others (including
PIP) will not work.  These same programs work fine when run on the
8" drive.

Does anyone have an idea why this is so?

Thanks!

Funny you should ask.  I am writing one as we speak (type?).  I have just
about finished the instuction decoding functions (8080 - Z80 will be an
enhancement one day.)  The next step will be to emulate the CP/M OS.

If someone else has done this I sure would like to hear from them to see
how they solved various problems.  Perhaps we can share notes.

Once finished I will be putting it into the public domain.  It is being
designed to run on different processors with some mods mainly to the
register structures to account for endian-ness.

Yes it's been done.  I think it came from the U. of Maryland.  We got
a tape from them a few years ago that included it.  Sorry I can't
remember more details at the moment, if no one else can help out I'll
see if we still have the tape somewhere.

The author was Chris T. or something like that...?

	Just in case many of you are unaware, and since it seems to
	be continually overlooked, there is also a utility called LT,
	which is currently LT29, I think, which is a file typing/extracting
	utility which handles ?Q? and ?Y? and ?Z? compressed files and also
	LBR's and ARK's. I do believe it is on Simtel, and certainly on most
	RCPM's (including mine, Pasadena ZNode 36 (818) 799-1632). Just FYI.

For some reason, my Osborne Executive has always choked on this program (as
well as the normal crunch/uncrunch program.) I have gotten around this by
using uncrunchers on other machines (such as uncr233 on the IBM.) Does anyone
have a C source code for an uncruncher for ?Y? compression (or anyone want to
tell me why the Osborne gags on these programs in the first place :) I tried
several other LZH decompressors on various machines, but they didn't recognize
the compressed file. The source might be in the .LBR distribution, but (of
course) it was in LZH format and thus totally useless to me.

(BTW, I found that the de-ark program's Z-80 version also died on the Osborne,
but the 8080 version works just fine.  Yes, the Osborne *does* have a Z-80 in
it...)

Subject: looking for a RSX that sets the CP/M+ error byte
Message-ID: <3046@dciem.dciem.dnd.ca>

As most know, submit.com under CP/M+ will skip a line that starts
with the ':' character if the poorly documented CP/M+ error byte is
set.  Most compilers and assemblers (SLR's assemblers are an exception)
don't set the error byte on error.  Sometime back, I remember noticing a
{arc,ark,lbr} released (perhaps by Mike of tektronics?) of make that
generated a .sub file after parsing a makefile - the .sub file used
the ':' mechanism.  Also included were example .mac files to make .RSX's
that attach to Aztec C'c cc.com, as.com and ln.com to monitor the
stderr output setting the error flag if error count reported is
greater than zero.  Does anyone else remember seeing this; what
was the file name?  A large BBS has given me somewhat
priv.access - given the correct filename to search for, I should
be able to find the file on it's backup WORM storage.

Thanks for any and all help,

- Binary Numeric OP codes are rather traditional among computers.
- I mean seriously, do you program in machine code? Opcodes are the numbers
- the machine uses to encode its different instructions.
- Do you mean the assembler's Mnemonics?  If you do, mnemonics like MOV, JMP

- This needs some comment.  In the CP/M programs that I have seen very few make
- use of the z80 extended instruction set.  Most people wanted their programs
- to work on as many machines as possible be they 8080, 8085, or z80.
-
- IMHO the reason the z80 was used in so many of the CPM machines had NOTHING
- to do with its instruction set.  It was used because of the hardware
- simplification it provided by giving DRAM support for free.  The engineers
- didn't have to do anything to make DRAM work.  Which was a good thing,
- because most engineers who tried to make DRAM controllers back then botched
- them but good. (think MITS ALTAIR)
- As to abandoning the 80x86 for the 68000, I can program each efficiently, yet
- I prefer to use the 80x86 family.  Why, because the hardware is simpler to
- design around, and I can fit very substantial programs in very small memory
- space.  I can't with the 68000 family.

>Someone should come up with the guts and money to speed up Z80;

- But seriously, speeding up the z80 won't scare Intel or anyone else.  What

- programs with wide address spaces.  Both the 80386 and the 68030 do this
- very well.  A fast z80 couldn't even enter the race.

Well, I personally think that that would be a good idea, but I'm not sure how
necessary it is.  I currently do all my word processing on a Kaypro II with a
couple of floppy drives, and in most cases it's considerably faster than an
hard drive equipped IBM AT.  My total time from boot up to the opening screen
of WordStar is less than ten seconds.  My modem program is a heck of a lot
faster to move around in and dial than Telix, too.    I think that the CP/M
machines are still d*mn useful, even if they are "obselete."  And after setting
up a brand new Mac with a hard drive for someone, I wouldn't hesitate to
recommend a used Kaypro or whatever (assuming it came with the original disks
and manuals) to any computer novice looking for an easy-to-use basic word
processing system.  (I'll reccomend the Mac to anyone who likes to spend hours
fiddling with FontMovers and obscure setup commands for desktop accessories and
the like.)

It would be helpful to those who might be able to help you to know what make
and model your Z80 machine is.  As you probably are aware, each manufacturer
elected to use his own combination of port addresses and peripheral chips, and
CP/M is not very portable from one make (sometimes, one model) of machine to
another.

Do I also infer that you are running DOS 2.11 on the same machine?  There are
only a few that have that dual capability.

back panel states model number 60-32.

Out side of being HUGE, its a little bizzare. It has a DSDD 8" floppy,
a standard size QIC tape drive, and some kinda hard drive, Priam I think.
It also has a bunch of boards plugged into some kinda buss on the back,
each board has two RS-232 plugs (or what looks like RS-232 plugs).

Also, not on the buss, is two more RS-232 plugs. Main consoles or printer,
I guess?

Anyways. I power the monster up, the hard drive makes a lotta noise,
but it doesnt boot. I put a blank floppy in the drive, and after 
awhile it seeks the drive.

Is there someone who could send me a boot disk for this thing? Along
with some of the needed utilities (floppy, tape and hard drive format,
etc). This looks like it could be an insane system, and Id love to
get it running.

Many thanx in advance!

Ever hear of threaded languages? Besides, if you're really cramming memory
you'd probably be better off with one of those 8-bit microcontrollers.

with the intel garbage to notice. (Think: Can you trust a company who's
logo is falling apart? i think not.)  the Z280 was developed as a contender
for the 286 processor. except that it handles memory THE RIGHT WAY. With 
linear addressing. none of this segmented memory wank-splut. it does top
out at a clock speed of 12MHz, but that is comparable to a 286 at about
40 MHz!! The 286's internal arcitechture is the lousyist design for anything

There are several reasons.  One is cost.  I bought a Kaypro 4 for $200, which
is the price of two double sided drives up here.  (Buy two drives, get computer
thrown in free!  What a deal!)  To get an equivalant IBM system would have cost
me about $500-$600 for the hardware and probably another couple hundred for the
software.  A good electronic type writer costs as much as my whole system (it
cost me another $85 for the printer).
Another reason is speed.  My Kaypro runs faster for non-number crunching tasks
than an 8 MHz XT with floppy drives (and in some cases, even a hard drive
system).  There's no way that a machine can load a 200K program faster than a
machine can load a 25K program.  And because the CP/M machine is doing a lot
less, even with less processing power it is often faster.  I get by fine
without a lot of the extras that the IBM programs do.  (I have no particular
need for windows.)

The last reason is that it's fun!  CP/M machines are simple enough that you can
play around and hack with the OS without any major problems.  If this is what
makes someone happy, then that's what they should be doing, no matter how cheap
XT motherboards are.

I'm not trying to start any kind of a "my computer is better than yours" war
here, just trying to point out why I prefer my CP/M machine to my IBM XT clone.
(I just bought the XT clone to run a BBS.)  Feel free to flame me though--just
send it to net.comp.amiga.  :-)

No kidding! I have come across TWO S100 CP/M machines, both with nice hardware 
(HDU, consoles, etc) for FREE. when you realize the raw power that a z80 has
you can see why many of us "who are stuck in the past" LIKE the Z80! according
to a test done by a friend of mine (also reachable through this common account;
email to Dent / cs2591aq@carina.unm.edu) the Z80a at 4MHz does a MIP. far as I can
tell, the IBM XT doesn't even come close to a MIP. Back to my topic tho... the
BIG Z80B machine @ 6MHz runs considerably faster than a 286 /16MHz machine..
when you throw in the 80mb hard drive and a hacked up copy of Uzi (very nice)
this machine does more than i could ever want in a personal computer. ( for any
one thats ever used ariel.unm.edu, this machine is comparable. (not it power, but
in time that it responds to user requests. ))  anyways...

Hi, it's me again.

I have discovered a really dumb terminal program in the BDS-C compiler

Also...

Is there a disk copy command out there that copies more than 1 track at

In my brief email exchange with Wayne Hortensius, he mentioned that he'd 
succeeded in using AT-style 1.2Meg 5.25" drives on a Cromemco Z2H as an
8" drive.  I've had no luck in reaching him via email, so I never learned
the details of his work.

It has since occurred to me that one might be able to do the same thing
with 3.5" drives.  In fact, I thought someone had told me that they'd
done it.  Has anyone on the net used a 3.5" drive on an 8" controller?
What did it involve, besides some cabling?  Any caveats?

Thomas,  TriSoft may be able to help you with some CP/M-68K software.
I know they still have BASIC, FORTRAN, and PASCAL in stock.  You might
also check the SIMTEL20 archives, there are a lot of utilities and
such in the CPM68K directory.  I believe someone was also converting
a version of C-KERMIT for CP/M-68K.  We never did it for our machines,
since they also had Z80's and we just used that processor for things
that were line-limited anyway.  I DO have an old copy of a stripped
down version of MODEM7 for -68K, but it is VERY buggy and the guy who
wrote it never had time to improve it.

There are a couple available for the Amiga, which has source provided.
I haven't looked at them in detail, but both also emulate a connected
terminal.  One has the source in assembler (68K), the other I'm not
sure, but it is probably also assembler (the author includes his assembler
and its source on the same disk).
The bulk of the code would be transportable, only the i/o would need to
be changed.

i am running QT on a Northstart Advantage... i have a copy of the 
Northstar patch thanks to Dave Goodenough (his e-mail address is the
the docs.. as he wrote it). a friend of mine and i are trying to 
add to it some of the VT100 features, like line insert. and get
rid of some of the bugs. (will probably get back to it over the 
summer, as everything is / will be coming down on us in school 
in the next month). one or two things you will need to do:

1) make sure that the version of the patch that you get disables 
   the extended, or high bit keys.. on the advantage, this includes
   all the function keys, and the keypad (when cursor lock is on)
   (this causes the many program to hang, or if that is fixxed, 
    then send a break to the outside world.. which is not good
   either) the way we have temporarily fixxed it is to simply 
   strip the high bit off... 

2) you will need a modified termcap if you are running on a 
   unix system. On VMS i have had real problems trying to edit 
   because the kepad is deactivated...

We are hoping to get these "features" fixxed this summer, 
and if there is still room to move, add some of the extra
charicter sets and things to it, to make it fully VT100 
compat. But first i just want to get things like line 
insert/delete and the keyboard to fully work. 

as for getting the ADM3A to work, i doubt it, as all the 
port addresses are unique to the Advantage (the horizon 
isn't even compat with the advantage)

some of the nice features of QTERM are the built in x/y modem 
and kermit protocal.

when i get the current patch uploaded to my unix account, i 
will be able to mail it off to any one who wants it.. just 
e-mail me... also, i will try to get the modified patch out
when i get it running, later this summer i hope.

While on the subject of cheap systems, I bought a CP/M-68k system
(8MHz 68000, 0.5 MB, 2x1MB drives, .....) for appr. $400. The 
original list price was some $8000 (yes, 20 times as much), back
in the dark ages (spring -85). Of course, until the C compiler
appeared in comp.os.minix, I had practically given up on using it
due to the nature of the Alcyon CC.
The reason for the cheapness was CP/M, meaning NO software avaiable
(the only software I found was an Modula-2 compiler, at the same
price as a single-user license for a SUN...).
Today, I couldn't even sell it without loosing money. Some day
I'll overcome my nostalgia, and sell it as scrap. SIGH.

Message-ID: <904@gold.GVG.TEK.COM>

I have looked into putting a 3.5" on my 8" controller, and the only
differences I could find are (1) the MOTOR_ON signal for the 3.5" 
drive -- it can be tied to DRIVE_SELx on the 8" drive, and (2) the
3.5" drive has seperate signals for DIRECTION and SIDE_SELECT, whereas
the 8" drive 'muxes' them. The data rates are identical. You will need
to tweak the stepper rate for the head.

There is (was ?) a 5.25" drive by Mitsubishi which is (was?) electrically
interchangeable with a 8" DSDD drive. It could store up to 1.6MB formatted.

Unfortunately, having just moved, gotten a new job, and being a new
first-time daddy, I haven't had time to _actually_ do it yet. As soon
as the &^%#@&$ doctor bills are paid, I'll snag a drive and try it.

No, I do not think "DXC B" makes any more sense than "DEC BC," regardless
of how old it is, and how used to it you are.

No, I do not care how "inherently" memory efficient the processor is.  The
fact that most useful PC programs are way-way beyond 64K (i.e., the "segment"
size) totally boggles my mind.  What do they have to do to make that happen?
You get a processor that is approximately 30% more efficient and blow the
code up quadruple!?  Fine; be like that.  After a while, memory efficiency
just has to give way to the programmer efficiency and execution rate.

And, finally, NO WAY is the 8086 easier to deal with hardware-wise than, say
Z8000 or 32000 or 68000.  Maybe my problem is that it takes me a while
to remember what exactly /BHE, /RQand A16/S3 stand for.  But, then
again, what exactly they do generally escape the conventional wisdom...
unless your conventional wisdom is confined to Intel architecture.
I know Intel is getting better at it every day, but the problem is, they

    IMHO, a _really_ twisted microprocessor is the RCA 1802.  No "CALL"
or "RETURN" instructions, for example.  If you want subroutines, you
have to execute "CALL" code (that you have to include), and for the
subroutine to return, the subroutine has to execute "RETURN" code
(that you also must provide!).

    I learned to program in the machine-instruction world with the INTEL
8080.  This was back in the days when S-100 machines (IMSAI 8080, Altair,
Cromemco, North Star, etc.) were the "going thing".  The 8080 then seemed
to be a straightforward processor.

    I then worked with the Z-80.  I remember thinking it to be more time
consuming to program (and debug) due to the increased number of insructions.
The Z-80, at the time, was the "hot chip".

    Subconsciously, I use the 8080 as a reference processor (in terms of
simplicity).  I suppose that I have a attachement to the 8080 because it
was the chip I learned on.

Awww, I like the 1802. 16 16-bit registers, any of which could be PC or
SP, but no 16-bit load-and-store instructions. It really could do calls
and returns, but only to coroutines by setting the PC. And it was a really
neat processor for FORTH, because the Forth threaded call was *faster*
than the Standard Call and Return Technique.

This is getting off the subject of CP/M. Followups to comp.misc.

About .4 mips at 4.77MHz with an 8086 (although you realize that
"mips" is pretty meaningless).

Only assuming it's executing single byte instructions. Something like

	ld	a,(0x1234)

takes 13 T states, so those done repeatedly would only achieve 1/3 MIP.
On average, I'd guess it'd hit about 1/2 MIP doing _REAL_ work, although
some instructions ('inc (ix + dd)' or 'call xxxx') really hog CPU T states.

On the other side though, it still chugs along nicely: a 4MHz Z80 can
do the CRC and data transfer to keep an Xmodem transfer going at up to
about 22000 BPS, and that's doing the CRC the hard way (i.e. bit banging),
with a table driven CRC, it'd probably exceed 38400 BPS.

Now, why do _I_ bother with CP/M: One reason is that you gotta keep it
small: 57K of TPA can vanish in a real hurry. Keeping it small usually
means keeping it simple, and simple programs are easier to write and
maintain.

Message-ID: <5248@quack.UUCP>

I am writing a Z-80 emulator in C as part of a CP/M-on-unix package.
It will be PD if/when I finish it (except for the parts still
copyrighted by Digital Research, if any. Confirmation anyone?).

I am stuck on the DAA instruction. Does anyone have an algorithm
that will do this? I have two books that tell me WHAT DAA does,
but not HOW it does it. Sigh.

Is anyone interested in this package if/when I finish it? It's
fairly straightforward. The way it'll work is you make a file
of a certain size (or more than one, if you want), then specify
that file on the command line. That file will then be a CP/M
disk. You can also connect files to CP/M's devices, like
PTR:/PTP:, etc. The tough part will be getting BDOS/CCP installed.
I'm fairly sure BIOS won't present any major problems.

Close, I use an 8" drive on a 5.25" controller (both running as high
density, i.e. 1.2 MB).

The difference that I know of, is that 3.5" drives use different
pull-up resistors (1 KOhm for 3.5", 300Ohm for 8" ??). This means that
you might not get away with quite the same length of cable.. .
Other than that, it should be a breeze (given that you can figure out the
settings of the dip-switches).

I would be incredibly grateful if anyone having success at this e-mail me some
insight.  I am having a devil of a time dealing with timing.  The 3.5s rotate
at 300 rpm and the 8s (and 5.25 hds) rotate at 360rpm.  My system is a Zenith
Z-100 and I'm using a stock Z-207 floppy (5.25 & 8) controller.

Many thanks!!!

Message-ID: <119@slovax.WA.COM>

	I've got an emulator that I wrote in a couple of evenings that
emulates the z80/8080 intersection plus some of the simpler z80
extensions. All of the hooks are present to enhance to a full z80,
but since I haven't had a need (we've only used generic cpm, no z80
specific stuff) I've left it as is. It's also not lightning, but
it's portable to just about anything. It sports a simple debugger,
disassembler, (assembler was in the works) and both hex and binary
load and unload. An i/o mapped 'hardware' interface and bios were
also written. Disk support is currently limited to four (4) 256k
floppy equivalents (disk files under UNIX), but is easily changed.
	If you're interested, let me know and I'll spend a little time
making it presentable and release it to netland.
	Anyone out there that's done the same or similar thing, I'd be
interested in hearing how you overcame some of the obvious problems.
I'm also more than willing to bend anybody's ear regarding how I
did it.

Back in December, Luke Weerts (luke@i88.isc.com) posted a recommendation 
for the No-Slot Clock, a time-of-day clock that interfaces through one of
a system's ROM sockets.  He reported that it worked well with his Kaypro.
He mentioned that ads for it appeared in Apple and PC magazines, but 
provided no further vendor info.  Has anyone succeeded in locating a 
supplier for this device?  I discovered a file called NOSLT20.LBR on

Subject: 3.5" on 8" Controller?

A long time ago (years) California Digital (a clearing house for dis-continued
products and bargins) sold a 5.25" disk drive that they claimed was an 8"
drive electrically.  I assumed that this means that it had the same electrical
interface (did that mean the same edge card connector wired the same way) as
an 8" drive did.  I remember that the 8" drives used a 50 pin daisy chained
cable, while the 5.25" drives used a 34 pin cable (basically the same signals,
a few were different, in different places on the cable.  I'm running 720K
3.5" drives on the same cable as my 40 and 80 track 5.25' drives (using the
same disk controller).  I have nothing on my 8" controller (never bought
any 8" drives B^).  I always wondered if I could add a HD 5.25 1.2MB drive
on the 8" controller?  My 1.2MB drive on my IBM-compatible PC is hooked to
the same 34 pin connector as my 720K 3.5" drive.  That sorta says no.  Anyone
successfully run a 1.2MB drive on an 8" controller?

If you arent afraid of calling long distance (whereever you happen to

A fellow there has succeeded in installing 3.5" flops on a Xerox

on a DEM-II unit.

No longer having a Xerox 820-II, I unfortunatly cant attempt this project.
Also, seems to require reburning ROMs, so the machine will know the new
allocations for the drives.

I've since bought BDS C 1.60c through Jay Sage.  I wish there was some way

Subject: CP/M Emulator
Message-ID: <11342@attcan.UUCP>

Not too sure if my last message got out... (postnews did a core dump!)

For the party interested in a cp/m emulator, i wrote an 8080 emulator
in C, with a pseudo clock, tty, disk, and dma controller, and i ported
cp/m 3.0 to this pseudo-machine. It runs every 8080 cp/m application i
have tried so far, and it has run unchanged on both an 80386 and a
WE32200 platform, so i suspect the code would work fine on a 68000
architecture.

The three drawbacks to this piece of code are:

	1/ Terminal i/o is fairly slow. I have tried a variety of buffering
	techniques, but few seem to have any useful impact.

	2/ It really needs to support the Z80 ops.

	3/ If i distribute it, i can only supply the sources for the emulator,
	and the cp/m bios drivers, i.e. you had better have a configurable
	cp/m on hand to link these drivers into.

If you would like to get your hands on this code, or just want more data,
please mail or post me...

Not that this will help you, but yes.  In late '82 or early '83 as an Alspa
Computer, as an experiment, hooked a recently announced (Mitsubishi?) 5-1/4"
drive up to one of their engineering systems, in place of the 1.2MB Tandons
they normally used.  As I recall it had the 50 pin connector.

It worked just fine, but the company didn't go ahead with it as a product
because there was no standard for 5-1/4" high-density formats, whereas for 
8" there was always SS/SD.

I would think that it should be possible to do just that.  Years ago, I
was putting together a Xerox 820-I and I installed both an 8" SSSD and
3 5 1/4" drives all daisy chained off the same cable.  The trick that I
used was this:  I too, noted that the 50 pin 8" connector and the 34 pin
5 1/4" connector carried the same signals on the same sides, but, they were
located at different pin numbers.  My solution was to use a 34 pin connector
but I used a small saw to cut the connectors slot so that there were no 
longer any stops on the ends of the connector.  (The "stops" as I refer
to them are the ends that keep the connector contact #1 aligned with
the board contact #1)  By removing these, I could then position the
34 pin connector (by offseting it from pin #1) so that the proper signals
were connected to the proper pins of the 8" drive connector.  

I don't have the info handy, but I beleive that I also, had to put a 
jumper wire on the 8" drive so that the motor on line was activated at
the same time as the drive select line.  Other than that, I don't
beleive that I had to do anything special to make things work.

Your problem is the reverse of mine, but, I don't see any reason why
it couldn't be done as long as you get the signals to the right pins!

	I am trying to locate a copy of kermit for
a Commodore PET running CBM for a friend.  I ftp'ed

recommend a way to port files from a IBM PC to a

Subject: RED Problems
Message-ID: <54748@bbn.COM>

I compiled and ran RED, early this morning, after struggling to get L2 
together (the BDS documentation could use a few corrections, here).  
RED cleared the screen, positioned the prompt line in a bogus place, 
and then quit after printing:

	Error: not enough room for buffers

This is on a 64K system.  I had linked RED using L2, since CLINK had been
complaining about not having enough memory.  The BDS manual suggested that
CLINK might do this, and L2 was included in the distribution as a solution.
L2 had reported the following:

	Number of functions: 255
	Code ends at: 0x984
	Externals begin at 0xA400
	Externals end at 0xB018
	End of current TPA: 0xC700
	Jump table bytes saved: 0xB97

It sure looks like RED doesn't have much room left for file.  I must admit 
that I was apprehensive when I saw the link statistics, and not surprised
when RED quit on me.  At least it didn't walk all over CP/M.

The bogus placement of the prompt line is my problem; I botched the control
sequence when I ran RCONFIG.  I doubt that this would affect buffer space.

So.  Any ideas on what might cause this?  I used the supplied SUBMIT files,
which copile RED1.C through RED14.C and then link it.  L2 had to go to
file mode, it ran out of memory after getting to RED4.C.  This is on a
Cromemco System Three running CDOS.

Yup, I had to put a sort piece of cable between the 50 pin and 34 pin
connectors to slightly re-arrainge the signals.  It definitely works.  The 5.25
hi-density 1.2M drive can indeed be considered electrically equivalent to an 8
inch.

Frankly, I don't understand how someone would DARE CRITICIZE someone who
puts as MUCH TIME and EFFORT into this hobby as does Phil.

In plain and simple terms, Phil DID SAY "If you think it can be done - do it
yourself.  That is why he stated his code is available to ALL.".  One of
ham-radio's objectives is the promotion of the ADVANCEMENT of radio art.
You would be hard pressed to find another who has put in as much time and
effort as Phil toward this goal.  

>any degree. And instead of a polite "no, no one is working on that but you
>are welcome to if you like" he gets this lecture on how his computer isn't
>worth using and he should buy a PC. When he says he likes his computer he

He said "It costs $60 for a PC motherboard."  Frankly, people who write
code like Phil's make ALOT more than that per hour.  I realize some people
don't, but at some point you CAN'T RETROFIT EVERY COMPUTER.  

Don't take this like I favor tossing old computers, just know the limits.
My executable for ka9q is about 700K.  There is NO WAY you are going to
get that running on a 64K Z80 CPM machine.  If there was, I'd be glad to
run it on my old stuff.  (By the way, I have a TRS-80 Model 4, 6 Televideo
800A's, and Televideo 816, and a bunch of other junk laying around if anyone
wants to play with old equipment.).

The 816 is a 16 port Z80 based MPM system with 40MB hard drive and 40MB
tape drive.  Interested?????  I'll let it go CHEAP.

Woe!  I won't even bother.  Frankly anyone who abuses Phil for being

Subject: More RED Woes
Message-ID: <54781@bbn.COM>

My thanks to Frank Wancho for pointing out the discrepancy in the link 
statistics.  The trick was to adjust the location of the start of the
externals area to free up more memory.  It bothers me that I had to 
recompile each C file to adjust this figure.  It took me close to an 
hour.

The editor now runs, sort of.  It clears the display, sets up the prompt
line and version message, and then sits there.  I get no response from
the keyboard, not even from ^C.  I have to reset the machine to recover.
Oh yeah, and it doesn't display the expected "end-of-file" marker or help 
instructions.

If I invoke it with a file specification, it does the same display set-up, 
then loads the specified file, displays the first page, and then sits there.  

So, it looks like the keyboard input code may be the problem.  I've seen
warnings in the BDS C manual about BIOS differences between real CP/M and
look-alikes, my CDOS being one of the latter.  The calling conventions
are the same, however, as are almost all of the call codes.  The fact
that it manages to do display set-up and file I/O seems to rule out
BIOS differences, but I can't be sure.  Can anyone tell me?

Subject: No-Slot Clock - Followup
Message-ID: <54779@bbn.COM>

Thanks to those who responded to my inquiry about the No-Slot Clock.
Armed with the information received, I made a few phone calls.

The No-Slot Clock is a device designed to be inserted between a ROM
and its socket.  It is distributed by SMT, which bundles the device
with software for use on PC's and Apples.  The device is, in fact, 
a Dallas Semiconductor SmartWatch, sold under an agreement with the 
manufacturer.  The SMT package includes the documentation needed to
write one's own driver.  They know of people getting it to work on
Commodore and Atari computers.  It is a 28-pin device, but is meant
to be work in 24-pin sockets as well with some simple jumpering.

I contacted two suppliers of the SMT package:

	Carlisle Computer		Central Computer Products
	959 Hill Road			330 Central Avenue
	Las Cruces, NM 88005		Fillmore, CA 93015
	800-333-2566			805-524-4189

The man I spoke to at Carlisle seemed to have a little more on the ball.
They advertise the package in the Computer Shopper for $39 plus $7 s&h.
Anticipated cost: $46.

The man I spoke to at Central guessed that they charged $69.  According
to Chuck Fuller's recent posting,  they last advertised it for $49.  The
March Computer Shopper has an ad from Central, but no mention of the NSC.
They indicate, however, that shipping is $4.50.  Anticipated cost: $53.50


Based on price and responsiveness, I am leaning toward Carlisle.  Has
anyone dealt with them before?  Did I catch Central on an "off" day?

By the way, the number for Dallas Semiconductor is 214-450-0400 (I can't
wait to see my long-distance bill :-).  They are sending me a catalog, 
which includes details on the various SmartWatch devices (they have RAM 
and ROM versions).

Message-ID: <5307@balu.UUCP>

Hello.

The Z280 will be released as a 12.5 MHz version this May. True.
But as Zilog says, a 25 MHz version will never appear. Sigh.

However, a Z80-CMOS with 20 MHz (5 MIPS) is available NOW!
Needs quite fast Cache-RAMs to operate, I guess...

This guy from Denmark had the bad luck of buying a CP/M-68K system. Although
quite small and fast, this OS never reached the popularity of CP/M-80
(2.2/3.x), of which we are talking when saying just 'CP/M', and for which
still new software is available.

Besides, if you take the PC & clone market away, there will be few who
are using Intel processors. They all use 68K, 32K, Z80/180/8000, TMS9995 etc.,
and they all know why! Very bad luck that IBM took these chips for their PC.
But, if you have a look at PC architecture, it isn't even better than that
of Intel processors. Every 10-year-old electronic hobbyist would have made
a better design than IBM's 'high-tech' engineers (and would have taken better
chips, also). Details are much too much to list here. Last but not least, the
architecture and quality of the mostly-used OS on that machines fits CPU and
and computer design. They probably found the worst OS for the worst computer
based on the worst CPU, but that is now called 'industry standard'.

BURP!

Good lord, thats an OLD chip you've got there... whew.. uhm, i doubt
if you'll find anything for CP/M (short of old Altair distribution tapes.)
that will support the 8008.  you might try (Tee Hee Hee) calling Intel and
seeing if they still have anything in their dumpsters on that chip.... 
(Even Better.. "Hello Intel? I was wondering if you still carried the 4004")
 
Find someone w/ an old altair is probably your best shot..  good luck!

Subject: No more Intel Bashing.

Well, I started it all, but I just wrote something really neat that will
say something to those who have been railing on CP/M unfairly...


Z80 is almost as intel as non-intels can ever get, too.  The point is
that we are all in the same boat.  No one processor is absolutely
superior to another - they all have their bells and whistles.

Intel's bells just happened to be "not my style."  What is important
is not the quality of the processor inherently, but how they are
used - that's why people say "I love my PC, PS/2, Mac, CP/M,
Unix, etc." and not "80C88-2, 32016, Z80B, 68020, TMS320C30, etc."

I have my own preferences - I do plan to some day become rich and
powerful and make my dream-processor come true by taking over
T.I., Intel, Motorola, and ALL!!!!  But, hey, I like my Z80, and,
you don't hit on my processor, I don't hit on your processor.
Besides, I am a philosophy major.  I will never be able to afford
Intel, not to mention a 386 machine....

True...True...But the 68000's are still very nice processors. I'm actually
quite surprised that CP/M-68K didn't get as popular as CP/M-Z80..
I hold the 680x0 line in the same regard as the Z80. its a nice, clean

Message-ID: <5269@quack.UUCP>

My Z-80 interpreter code is now finished. Currently the interpreter
itself and an admittedly lousy debugger are in need of alpha-testing.
I have had a chance to test only a small subset of the operations,
but those I have tested appear to work ok. This is not a completed
project, so if you hate finding bugs, don't bother.

Anyone interested in alpha-testing the interpreter on a piece of
Z-80 code, please write. Thanks in advance. As soon as the interpreter
and debugger are debugged, I'll start working on a BIOS and CP/M
implementation.

Message-ID: <3337@minyos.xx.rmit.oz>

I presently maintain for an outside group an aged EXIDY Sorcerer running CPM2.2.
I would like to transfer software back and forth via a DOS machine, but try as
I may I cannot read my CPM disks on the PC. I've used SYDEX's ANADISK and
disc copy routines, but neither analysis nor copy works. Nor do any of the other
copy or analyse routines I've been able to locate. Not being in any
sense a CPM guru, I seek advice from some whizz out there who may have had
experience with a similar m/c. An alternative, of course, would be a simple
cable set-up to provide a serial link between the two m/cs, or modem access.
One problem is an acute shortage of documentation about the m/c, so everything
I do is guesswork. Any help gratefully received. If you wish to email me, my
address, mailers willing, is    rxxqva@skaro.xx.rmit.oz.au.

Yes, you can run 9600 on those old 8-Bits!  There's an RCP/M right here in 
Houston that allows 9600+ bauds operations.  The best BBS programs for CP/M
right now are PBBS, PICS, and ZMSG.  Of course you will also need ZCPR and all 
those goodies too.  Phillip

Subject: Z-80 DAA instruction & CP/M-on-unix
Message-ID: <XX0001123c@pallio.UUCP>

I tried mailing this, but someone burped on it. Anyway, this may
be of general interest .....

The DAA instruction promises to be a real horror. You'll need to note
three things from the last 8 or 16 bit add / subtract operation:
the standard carry (i.e. from bit 7), the half carry: this flags if
there was a carry out of bit 3, into bit 4: do something like:

	hc = ((op1 & 0x0f) + (op2 & 0x0f)) & 0x10

where op1 and op2 are the two operands in the add. Note also if it
was an addition or a subtraction. This is basically collecting the
following three Z80 flags: C, I, N (carry, half carry - aka intermediate
carry, and negative (i.e. subtraction). Note the N flag is distinct from
the S (sign) flag - the S simply echos bit 7 of the acc, whereas the N
notes whether the last 8 bit op was an addition or subtraction.

Now for the fun stuff:

	if (addition) /* i.e. N is clear: last op was an add)
	 {
	    if (half carry set || (acc & 0x0f) < 9)
		add 6 to acc
	    if (main carry set || (acc & 0xf0) < 0x90)
		add 0x60 to acc
	 }
	else		/* subtraction */
	 {
	    if (half carry set || (acc & 0x0f) < 9)
		subtract 6 from acc
	    if (main carry set || (acc & 0xf0) < 0x90)
		subtract 0x60 from acc
	 }

I think this is right, but I wouldn't want to swear to it.

I then dug out "The gospel according to Carr" (The Z80 user's manual,
by Joseph Carr, ISBN 0-8359-9516-X ) - It has the following table for
what happens in a DAA.

Used with	   C	     C		I	low	  high	    number
instruction	 before    after      before	nibble	  nibble    added
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
ADC\		   0	     0	        0	 0-9       0-9	     00 
ADD >		   0	     0		0	 a-f	   0-8	     06
INC/		   0	     0		1	 0-3	   0-9	     06
i.e. N flag clear  0	     1		0	 0-9	   a-f	     60
		   0	     1		0	 a-f	   9-f	     66
		   0	     1		1	 0-3	   a-f	     66
		   1	     1		0	 0-9	   0-2	     00
		   1	     1		0	 a-f	   0-2	     fa
		   1	     1		1	 0-3	   0-3	     a0
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

SBC/		   1	     1		0	 0-9	   7-f	     a0
i.e. N flag set    1	     1		1	 6-f	   6-f	     9a

Now, the addition table looks OK, but I'm a little suspicious of the
subtraction table. By my reckoning there's only 2048 possible inputs
into this: 8 bits of acc data, C, I and N make another 3 for a total
of 11 bits - these can only take 2048 distinct inputs. It might be
instructive to write a little program to stuff all 2048 values into
a DAA instruction, and tabulate the results. That way you'd see what
a real Z80 does in all cases.

You'll forgive me for playing devil's advocate, but we're comparing apples
and oranges here. The SDLC is probably done with an SIO, which is capable
of doing all the CRC and framing trickery itself, all the Z80 has to do is
stuff bytes into the SIO, and with a DMA, the Z80 could actually spend a
good proportion of the time asleep.

I'm not sure you can do sync prtotocols with an async only uart: the hunt
phase would be a real nightmare, and you'd get in all sorts of trouble with
the incessant start and stop bits. Hence I can see a Z80A very easily
achieving 56KBPS doing SDLC (probably faster if the SIO could be clocked
fast enough). However, the Xmodem needs to have the Z80 do the CRC
evaluation as well, so it's got to do a little more work.

Not that I'm condemning 56K SDLC or anything, it's kinda nice to hear that
the Z80 is up to talking to the big guys as a peer. I'm sure that with a
little creative genius, it would be possible to do such wonders as HASP
and RJE from a Kaypro (look out BITNET - here come the CP/M'ers :-> )

There actually was a commercial HASP/RJE program for CP/M, and it
worked pretty well.  We had it running on a Northstar Horizon tied to
a 4,800 bps four-wire sync modem circuit to our IBM mainframe.  It was
just a couple of jumper changes on the header of the second serial

Are you kidding?  I just bought copies of Aztec C for Apple ProDOS and
CP/M from Manx three weeks ago.  When I called, a woman answered the phone
in a professional manner, had never heard of what I wanted and passed me
along to another woman who was very helpful.  She said they BOTH compilers
in stock, and I had them in my hand 7 days later (shipped UPS ground).
She did admit that she didn't know anyone was still using Apple CP/M, though.

I've called their technical support BBS sevaral times, and it seems to be
active, and it still answers the phone as "Manx".

Maybe the guy I spoke to hacked me.  I originally called 201-780-4004, 
which is the number listed in the Aztec C manual I had borrowed from a 
fellow employee.  The man who answered said that Manx no longer had that
number.  He could not provide me with the new number.  I then called
directory assistance (201-555-1212).  The operator gave me 201-780-3072
as the number for Manx Software Systems.  I called the number and got
the results I posted above.  Did I get the wrong number?  I am both
disappointed and embarrassed for receiving and propagating incorrect 
information.  May I have the correct phone number, for future reference?

Maybe the guy I spoke to hacked me.  I originally called 201-780-4004, 
which is the number listed in the Aztec C manual I had borrowed from a 
fellow employee.  The man who answered said that Manx no longer had that
number.  He could not provide me with the new number.  I then called
directory assistance (201-555-1212).  The operator gave me 201-780-3072
as the number for Manx Software Systems.  I called the number and got
the results I posted above.  Did I get the wrong number?  I am both
disappointed and embarrassed for receiving and propagating incorrect 
information.  May I have the correct phone number, for future reference?

  I'm the fellow who bought John Core's Mole 32 - the ugly one with the two 8 inch HD drives - small world isn't it?  Any chance you might be interested in writing a BYE5 insert for the Mole?

I think what you need is SYDEX 22DSK which permits reading 'foreign' formats
into DOS.  ANADISK does not have that capability as I recall.  UNIFORM is
another possibility, but I don't know that it covers the EXIDY format or not. 
The null modem is the final fallback if you have a communications program for
the EXIDY.

Subject: Why Bother With CP/M?
Message-ID: <17632@orstcs.CS.ORST.EDU>

Why bother with CP/M?  

It's not much of an answer, but more of a preface: my very first computer
was a Xerox 820/I, the single-board wonder.  The guy who put it all together
used old steel Tektronix cases as chassis.  They are indestructible, and
give one the added advantage of having an extra seat around for a guest.
 
"Can't find a seat!"
"Go ahead...sit there."
"But, that's the computer!"

Seriously though, We here at SunDial use two computers.  One is an IBM PCI,
which we lucked into...the salesman was under the impression that the drives
were Single Side Single Dense, and only 128Kb memory, and when we got home
with it ti turned oout those drives were DSDD, and 256Kb memory...for $250,
and IBM original.  I have been exploring the PCDOS 3.3 world as a child with
the bestest new toy in the universe.  I really like it...features like sub-
directories allowing me to organize files to my liking, and compatibility with
all the shareware I could ever want.

Sure couldn't do that with CP/M.

But what I can do with CP/M is: the same basic stuff, simply, quickly, and
well.  So your computer is a '386 that runs at 32 Meg with so much storage I
could move a Cambodian family in.  Last time I looked at my applications,
I just plain didn't need such conspicuous consumption.

So, I like the IBM world, more so that I now can tak a part in it.
But don't tell me that CP/M is:

Outmoded 
Difficult 
Too Simple,   Or, that favourite stupid comment that I mostly hear snooty
Clone and Macintosh users spout....
 
Isn't that an OBSOLETE OS?

NO, no more than breathing air an obsolete way of getting respiration.

(next time a snooty IBM/Clone/Mac user starts getting your goat, remind them
of a great advantage of 'obsolecence'....

	When was the last time you heard a CP/M user all upset about
	Whether or not a virus was getting at their system.

	They shut up real quick after you remind them of this.)

Yeah.  22DSK should have it - it is configurable, too, so if you
know your disk format, (and understand the 22DSK manual well enough)
you can fit it to read your CP/M format on any PCDOS machine
(not all MS-DOS machines).

It is in SIMTEL under <msdos.dskutl>22dsk130 or 132.arc or somewhere
thereabouts.

I'd be glad to ship it out through the net or by mail (perhaps a posting

Please give me about a week to get this out, as it is located on a computer

I'll also try to piece together some docs on how to get the emulator

You betcha - the Pet is a 6502 machine. I ought to redirect followups
to comp.sys.cbm, but I don't know if the INFO-CPM gateway groks 822
headers :-).

Anyway - the Pet is the grandaddy of the C64 / C128 family: if you don't
use any screen / device peeks and pokes, it's possible to swap basic
programs between the C64 and the Pet.

We now return you to your regular CP/M material :-)

Anyways, Z8400 is Zilog's official part number for Z80.
Z8400H is the 8 (or is it 10, now?) MHz beast.  B is supposed to stand

H and B that designates packaging.  I doubt that mail order places

Hi Andy,

I'm sorry to tell you that all the older Commodore's (20xx,30xx,40xx,80xx)
are using a very special disk format which is in no way corresponding to
the worldwide standard 'IBM 3740'. So, you will have to go the hard way:
via null-modem...

Hi.

The exact name of the 20 MHz CMOS Z80 is : Z84C0020xxx
(where xxx is to be replaced by the case/temperature specifier)
But I personally don't see much sense in using this chip for a CP/M system.
It is intended for small and fast (TTL-I/O) controller boards. The features
you need for making any OS work aren't possible at that speed (think of DRAM
or the 4 MHz Z80-DMA).

Well, I know that the 68K is a very fine processor
(orthogonal Instruction Set, for example).
Would be my choice too, if I hadn't a Z180 system
(working on upgrade to 280).

I too am sorry that the 'standard' does not seem to be changeable anymore.
Some millions of 'these craps' won't be thrown away...

	"It might be instructive to write a little program to stuff all

	That way you'd see what a real Z80 does in all cases."

Better yet, just use this table in your implementation of the DAA
emulator, and don't bother to work out the algorithm.  This table
lookup is probably the fastest you can go without precompiling some
code.

this fails for a very simple reason. if this is a exidy disk system, it
uses the micropolis disk controllers and drives.  these use 16 sector
hole media. any disk analysis program you have would have to read hard
sectored media.  i have never heard of any non-hardware solution to this.

i have owned an sorcerer, and have hacked the hardware to do 80x24 video,
running at 5.5 mhz. berry ugly. anyway, one person who has full documents,
including schematics and extra rom-pacs, is:

	(415) 632-5100

drop a dime to him and he can fill your ear in a hurry about exidy.
also, you might be able to talk him out of a copy of docs or spare
parts.

re: transfer to dos
2 solutions, 1 hard but fun, 1 easy but boring.
1) get a compupro disk1, plug it into your backplane,
hack the cbios to read/write ibm pcdos format yourself
using DOSDISK.
2) serial cable using pip/xmodem/whatever.

I connect back to the remote and it is still sending packets, the same

April 14, 1990: TRENTON2.MSG

                         TRENTON COMPUTER FESTIVAL
                         =========================

                Saturday, April 21 -- Sunday, April 22, 1990
              Mercer County College and Trenton State College

   On Saturday, April 21, 1990, at Mercer County College, there will be an
all-day 8-Bit (CP/M and Z-System) workshop featuring as speakers the authors
of the most exciting new program offerings of the past two years.  Door
prizes will be given out to those who register.  With so many of the activists
in 8-bit computing coming to the show, I am pretty sure we will hold some
activities on Sunday morning as well.

   In the evening, at Trenton State College, there will be the annual
banquet, featuring industry luminaries (past speakers have been Bill Gates
of MicroSoft and Seymour Rubenstein of WordStar).  The featured guest this
year is David House, one of the leaders of Intel.  The 8-bit community will
also be making a short presentation and giving out additional door prizes at
the banquet (official approval no longer pending; it was granted today).

   The program as published is shown below.  With all the new people coming,
we may break up some of the slots so that we can accommodate some additional
short talks.  Information about getting to the festival has appeared in other
files and will not be repeated here.

        TRENTON COMPUTER FESTIVAL 1990

        The  15th annual Trenton Computer Festival will be held on  April
        21-22,  1990  on the campus of Mercer County  Community  College,
        Trenton, NJ.

        A ticket costs $7.00 ($3.00 for students and senior citizens) and
        provides  admission for both days.  A "Sunday-only" ticket  costs
        $5.00.

        The keynote speaker will be David House, executive vice president
        of  Intel Corp.  He will speak in the Kelsey Theater at  4:00  PM
        Saturday.

        Tickets for the banquet are $15.00.  Once more, Sol Libes will be
        the master of ceremonies.

        Because  MCCC  is  a commuter college, the Flea  Market  will  be
        BIGGER THAN EVER BEFORE!!

        ALL  parking  will be at Mercer County Park,  with  entrances  on
        Hughes  Drive and on Old Trenton Rd. (county route 535).  A  free

Subject: WordStar 4.0 Console Patch Problem
Message-ID: <900417-125101-4442@Xerox>

I upgraded my copy of CP/M WordStar 3.3 to the newer 4.0 version, but am
having trouble getting the function keys on my keyboard to work.  Can
anyone give me a hand here?  The computer is a Xerox 820-II, with a low
profile keyboard, and 5.0 ROM's.

Since for the most part, the 820's function keys return values above '7F',
and do not use the "burst" mode used by 4.0's FUNDLY::/FUNTBL::, I could
not use WS's function key area.  I had to write my own console routines.
There are three optional console I/O routines that can be user supplied in
WS 4.0.  They are UCNSTA:: (User Console Status), UCONI:: (User Console
Input), and UCONO:: (User Console Output).  I only used UCNSTA:: and
UCONI::, as console output was fine the way it was.

The UCONI:: now checks first to see if a function key is already being
processed (multiple byte function).  If not, it gets the next character
from console using BDOS function 6, Direct I/O.  If this character is less
than '80' hex, it is passed back to WS.  If it is a function key, it
references a look up table containing the number of keystroke bytes to be
passed back, and the actual keystroke bytes.  A flag is set to show that
multiple bytes need to be passed, and the position in the look-up table is
stored.  The first keystroke is then passed back to WS.

If a function key IS being processed, it grabs the next byte from the
look-up table, and passes it back to WS, same process as before, except the
flag is cleared once all the bytes have been passed back.

The UCNSTA:: simply checks the process flag.  If it's true, it returns a
value stating that another character is ready from the console.  If it's
false, then it calls BDOS function 11, the console status function.  This
is how I handle the multiple byte functions from UCONI::.

It almost works, but not quite.  I must type slow, or some characters are
duplicated, while others are missed.  The cursor position is always
correct, even if a character is printed twice.  Also, if I try to load a
new document, WS locks up.  Old files load fine.

Can anyone give me a hand here?  I suspect maybe part of my problem is in
using BDOS Call 6, but I can't figure another way to get a character
without if first being output to the console.

Subject: Cromemco WDI-II HDC Compatibility
Message-ID: <55002@bbn.COM>

I am contemplating purchasing a WDI-II, which is a hard disk controller 
that Cromemco used to offer for its S-100 computers.  I am waiting for
a snail-mail reply from the seller regarding compatibility of this 
controller with currently-available drives.  I've been stung twice, 
now, by Cromemco's non-standard signal assignments, on the 8" floppy 
disk controller and the parallel printer card.
From: gonzalez@bbn.com (Jim Gonzalez)
Path: bbn.com!gonzalez

So, has anyone had experience with the WDI-II?  Has anyone succeeded in
using it with drives that are still available?  If not, does anyone have
a line on an ST506, ESDI, or (unlikely) SCSI controller for S-100?

I sure wish I could go to the Trenton show this weekend; I'm sure they'd 
have one down there.

You've got to be either mistaken or messed up. the ST506 is a 5meg unbuffered
seek segate HD... i keep hearing people say "Thats a 80meg" and i've SEEN 
St506's run, i have documentation for 506's and everything. ugh. a 5 meg drive.
what a sick thought. if you want 80megs, try part number ST4096 next time.
80.2 mb MFM, 96mb RLL. tis what my Leviathan has attached to it.

grr... if its one thing i'm a stickler for is correct part numbers. anyways,

if you REALLY wanna hook up a 506, tho i don't think you want to, all hard drive 
controllers have support for the 506. 
ST506 4 heads, 153 cylinders, 128 b Read/write comp., 128 b Write Precomp.
ST4096 9 heads, 1024 cylinders, 1024 b RWC, 0 Write Precomp.

    Does anyone remember the Kaypro? I didn't think so... Anyway, I have
a Kaypro IV '83 in excellent condition, with all of the original software
masters, backups, upgrades, books, and manuals, along with other commercial
and public domain software. It also has Rembrandt (a graphics upgrade with
software). 
    It has been a super little machine for me, but seeing as I have neither
the time nor the money to tinker anymore, I must unload it. It has been sitting
in my dorm room closet and I just don't have room for it. Like I said, it is
in excellent condition (it could use a head cleaning, though) and I have
made no alterations to it, with the exception of installing the graphics
upgrade chip. (I still have the chip that generates the Greek character set.)
    The big question is, does ANYONE want to buy it, or know of ANYONE that
would?? PLEASE, oh pleeeeeeease send mail or post something ASAP. I have no
time or patience to call around to users groups or search through magazines,
so all of your help is GREATLY appreciated!! Thank you in advance!!

CEO file contents:
I have been reading this message board for some time, and a few
questions have come up that I hope someone may be able to help me on.

1.  I recently got an Osborne 1 (in the Blue Case), but I hardly have
any technical information on it.  Is there someone that can help me
get copies of the schematics, BIOS and PROM listings, and a technical
manual (if one was ever created).  I am trying to get any information
on all the ports that I can get.  I also have their modem which
connected to the special modem port and fit in the disk slot, and
would like information on that (I have the docs, I need technical
information).

2.  I also have an Epson QX-10 with a Comfiler 10meg hard drive.  Does
anybody have any technical information on that, and more importantly,
has anyone tried using that controller to control larger or a second
hard drive?

3.  I have been reading all the discussions about hooking modern IBM
drives (both 5.25" and 3.5" disk drives) to old CP/M machines.  The
Osborne 1 I recently got has a faulty B: drive, but A: works fine.  I
was wondering if I could replace this with a high-density drive.  The
advantage to this is that all the IBMs that I work with have the
high-density drives and I have programs that write Osborne (and QX-10)
format, but since I am using a high-density drive, the Osborne (and
the QX-10) cannot read them.  I would also then like to change the
BIOS so that it could write an IBM compatible format.  

4.  I would also like to try and hook up a 5.25" disk drive to the
QX-10, but as a 3rd floppy.  I know from the European version of the
machine that the controller can handle up to 4 drives.  How difficult
would hooking up a 3.5" disk drive over the 5.25" drive (and would it
be able to read write without BIOS changes, even though it would not
use it full capacity).

Thanks in advance for any help that you can give me.

OK, FLAME -ON

Jim is asking about a disk controller that uses the ST-506 INTERFACE, not about
an ST-506 disk drive!  You may be a stickler for correct part numbers, but
when you decide to flame someone, PLEASE understand what that person is
talking about.  There are 4 common disk drive interfaces today, ESDI, IDE, SCSI,
and ST-506 (also called MFM, also called ST412, etc, etc, etc).  My ST-506
controller talks very nicely to any ST-506 interface drive including a ST4096
(if I chose to run one!).  I have had Shugart 603's on it, and am currently
running a Miniscribe 3460 on it (Can you say 40MB, sure you can!).

ER! FLAME -OFF

BTW Jim, I was lucky enough to find a Morrow HDC/DMA years ago for a good price.
Good luck finding a good controller, they're becoming very scarce.

Subject: Looking for software
Message-ID: <30680001@hprmokg.HP.COM>

I have a CPM machine that i am looking for software for, particulary
on 8" disks. I currently have stuff like Wordstar with mail merge and
Calcstar and Datastar, although one file for Datastar became trashed
and i can't find the backup. 

So, my request is for anyone who may have CPM software on 8" disks with
documentation to sell. I would like the replace my trashed Datastar also.


Thanks

I'd be *REAL* careful about relying on the Carr book for much of
anything - *ESPECIALLY* the DAA instruction. I got bit by one of the
many, many typos and just plain errors in this book once upon a time,
and it took me a long while to figure out that I wasn't doing anything
wrong - it was the book!
 
The exact problem? Carr lists the DAA instruction as being usable after
the following instructions: ADD, ADC, INC, NEG, SUB and SBC. Not true.
INC doesn't alter the Carry flag, and when that sucker's set, DAA does
Very Interesting Things (it adds too much to the most significant
nibble). I ran into this in an interrupt driven RTC - the time was being 
kept in BCD, and every time the interrupt happened when the Carry flag
was set, the time went gaga.
 
Other problems that I remember are missing opcodes in the opcode
listings, opcodes without detailed descriptions, etc. Carr is a very
nifty looking book - but it's not reliable information.

ST-506 and ST-412 interfaces ARE NOT THE SAME.

The 506 specs have write precomp.  The 412 doens't.  The 506 precomp line is 
is used in the 412 to switch to the other 8 heads.
506 can have 8 heads but no more, 412 can have 16.

This has been known to cause more than one person grief.

Are you sure that's not really an ST412 controller (=ST506 with buffered
seeks)?  If we're going to be sticklers with part numbers, we might as well
go all the way! :-)

Actually, the controller doesn't give a hoot whether it's an ST-506
(unbuffered) or an ST-412 (buffered seek).  It just sends out step signals at
the rate that the hard-disk driver tells it to.  However, if the drive is in
fact an ST-506, and some one forgets to enter the appropriate step rate in the
driver - assumes buffered seek, that is - it will just about 'buzz' that poor
old unbuffered thing to death!

I'm the one who started this thread a while back & I can tell
you that I would want it.

What I need to do is to be able to run an old CP/M c-compiler under unix.
I'm sure that the only "bdos" calls the compiler makes is for
sequential disk reads/writes, and console writes.

None of the "raw" termio, printer, etc, stuff is needed.  In fact,
none of the "ccp" & "bdos" & etc is needed, just a way to handle the
dozen or so common system calls & to get the program running. No
reason to use the digital research bdos -- just translate the
"read sequential" into a unix read, etc.

Besides, who would want to use the "ccp" commands anyway? All it
does is parse the command line (let /bin/sh do that), setup the
base page (no big deal), implement "era" & friends (who would
want them) & print "BAD LOAD" (extra credit for knowing why!).

I think that a z80 emulator would be a long way to getting a working emulator.

I've had my suspicions about the book - it does have it's typos. My own
worst complaint is that there is _NO_ reference anywhere to instruction
timing: how many T states and how many M cycles does a particular
instruction take? Still, that can be taken from Zilog's own Z80 data
sheet. I suppose that one day I'll have to write up something for the
Z80, based on how the CPU in my system here works ....... one day .....

Has anyone gotten Dbase II to work properly on a TRS-80 Model IV
using Montezuma Micro CP/M.  I have a working copy for my Osborne
1, and the DBINST.COM installation program.  The osborne version
loads in and runs, but gives a very strange cursor
(inverse video m)@(block cursor) and prints this sequence between
every character entered.  I also have the demonstration program
for Dbase II which runs fine (no strange characters). It signs
on as version 2.3B DEMONSTRATOR.  Also, what is the difference
between this version, and the non-demonstrator version, besides
that the installation program does not seem to work with it.
 
If you need more info to help me, just ask, any hints would be
appreciated.

Hi

The subject line says it all: A Shugart 800 8" drive contains exactly one
transistor, close to the left rear corner.  It is marked S-PN2222A.
Unfortunately, the one in my drive was sheared off, no hope of ever getting it
soldered back on.  Question: What type is this transistor, expressed in a more
normal part number ? What 2Nxxxx can I use instead of it ??? Please no exotic
types, getting hardware out here in the middle of the Pacific is pretty hard.

I recently acquired an old KAYPRO 4.  I only got a copy of WORDSTAR
with it and am looking to get more software for it.  Anything would
be appreciated (Editor, Communications pkg, games etc).  Would anyone
in 'netland' be willing to provide some if I provide a SASE and
disk(s)?  Are there any other BBSs or places I can get CPM Software
that would work on it?  It is stock equipment with 2 5" disk drives.

My understanding is that the ST412 is a buffered seek version of ST-506
which is why many controllers or disks may say ST506/ST412.  Most, if not
all, drives that called "ST506 interface" are really ST412 ones, but are
called ST506 for historical reasons.

Also, a drive with a ST506/ST412 interface can be running RLL encoding
as well (the drive itself really can't tell if it's RLL or MFM, only
it's controller knows for sure).

The last time I bought hard-sector diskettes for the Horizon, I got them
from Inmac.  Inmac is a large supplier that focuses on corporate computer
users, but also deals with provate individuals.   They are not a discount
house, but their prices are OK.  They listed their private-label 10-sector 
floppies at $1.69 each, this time last year.  The prices drops to $1.39
in quantites of 60 or more.  They have local offices in LA and San Diego 
(you said "Southwest", but I believe JPL is SoCal).  Phone numbers for
Inmac:

	Catalog (US)	800-826-8180
	Catalog (CA)	800-722-0085

If you don't find any other suppliers, these guys will have them.  Good luck.

Howdy folks.

I recently picked up an Osborne Executive, and am looking for all the
info I can find on it.  It's in great condition, and has 2 DD drives.

Basically, I'd like to find some sort of terminal program so I can
download programs for it from GEnie on my Atari ST, and transfer them
over.

I got quite a few manuals, but didn't get anything that actually teaches
how to use the thing.

It looks quite interesting and I'd like to start messing around with it.
Any help is greatly appreciated.

If the LISTSERV/TRICKLE servers can't get a particular file from us,
it's highly likely that a newer version became available.  That is the
case with QTERM, which is now QTERM42G.LBR in PD2:<CPM.QTERM>.

Best to get a fresh directory listing first before complaining, and
best to complain to one of us if the file disappeared rather than a

It's time for me to start writing the BIOS for my CP/M emulator.
(Not all the bugs in the Z-80 are gone, but the alpha-testing
is showing fruit, so to speak). Could someone please pass along
the layout of the BIOS jump table? Specifically, entry and
exit conditions, effect(s), and in the case of cold and warm
boots, where to jump to on completion (I presume a cold boot
terminates by falling into the warm boot, and that the
warm boot terminates by calling BDOS 13, reading in the CCP
and jumping to the first byte of the CCP, but I'm not sure).

Thanks in advance.

Subject: Strange machine
Message-ID: <29247@cup.portal.com>

Recently recived a slighty strange machine, and wanted to get some
input on it. Its not a bad machine, but a little odd, and in being
odd, may be hard to do certian things...

First off, its called a DE-100 Disk Emulator, from Design Analysis
Associates. Theres two ports on the back: console, and remote. Both
are RS-232C. The console is at 9600 right now, and remote is 2400.

On the front is where the bizzare stuff comes into play. First, its
got a 700k DSDD 3.5" disk. the front panel has a bunch of ports:

a floppy connector (standard 5.25" not 8"), and a whole array of
LEDs that match each line on a floppy connector (track 00, select,
etc)
 
Then theres five other ports for hard drives (5.25"): one address
buss, and four data buss connectors, and the same LED array.

Inside is a card cage, mounted on a hinge, with about 10 cards.
The CPU is a Z80A (or it may be an H). 

It runs CP/M 2.2, comes up with 62k RAM, and runs ZCPR2 and ZCPR
3.4 just fine, it even has a version of MDM and its associated
overlay. It also as a RAM drive at C: with about 189k. Also included 
is the disk emulator software, which of course I have no idea how
to use! One thing, somewhere along the line I ran a program
called MEMTEST, which does some insane diags (takes 41 minutes
to complete!) It states 'STD-buss 256k'. I seem to remember 
STD-buss from somewhere, but cant place it..

Anyone? The machine was basiclly free (part of a trade deal. But
since I dont have a personal CP/M machine, its the best I got. A 
Xerox 820-II is running a BBS, so I cant use that...)

Back around 1978 I was involved in a project to build a 3270 cluster emulator
with local processing.  Disk storage was up to 4 8" floppies.  One day, when
the system stopped responding, we checked the cabinet.  One door wouldn't
open.  When we finally pried it open, we extracted the diskette jacket but
a large arc of the vinyl inside was missing.  It had been chewed off and
pulled out through the r/w slot.  The jack was UNdamaged!

So, yes, drives that run constantly are a real problem.  But not all 8" drives
run constantly.  The Tandon 848 doesn't, amoung others.

Several of my friends used to do that.   There are a couple of things to note.
If you are using the old style full height drives, with AC motors, the system
do run a lot.  I ran an 8" 24 hour per day for a couple of years.  What
happens is the bearing clamping rings go first.  

There have been kits designed to power off the AC motors, and only fire up
when data is accessed.  Seem to work quite well.  You'd probably have to home
brew your own.  There was circuit diagram published YEARS ago in one of the
CMP oriented magazines, if I remember correctly.

If you are using one of the newer 8" drives, eg Shugart 860, or the Tandon 82x
series, they are DC drive.  Early models were belt drive, later direct driven.
They power up the motor on data access, as an option, and drives run only when
you need them.   The ONLY thing you need to do on those type systems is
install a delay so that the drive is at speed before data is tried or you get
"not found" or similar errors.  

I put away my 8" drives (except on my Max80) a long time ago.

I have the techinical manual for Epson QX-10.  Nothing on Hard disk,
but I can help with floppies.

YES!!  The US output of the uPD765 is decoded into ALL FOUR drive
select signals, something that doesn't always happen with two-drive
machines (IBM-PC, especially the Jr.).  But, You DO have to modify
the bios - actually, it can be modified by an application software,
and that's the beauty of it.  I think you should talk to Epson and
ask for the BIOS listing as well as info on Extended BIOS.  (BIOS
being NOT the ROM but the CP/M BIOS!!! - that's why it can be modified

I think it was sold circa 1982 as a diskette duplicator, could read and write

That part (According to the Shugart SA800/801 Maintance Manual) is 2N2907A

The 2Nxxxx equivalent of that is a 2N2222, which is EXTREMELY
non-exotic, it's rediculous.  That's a very common part, a
switching transistor.  Just pop on down to your favorite
neighborhood RatShack store and snag one, or whatever your favorite

I don't know about floppy life while just turning, but you *don't* want
to leave the drive spinning with the head loaded.

Alspa Computer had a customer who was complaining about short disk life;
in several (3?) days of constant operation the disk would wear through.
After we spent some time examining the heads of the Tandon drives (which
had a manually operated head load mechanism - when the disk is inserted
the head is down) and finding no rough spots, I saw on one of the disk
boxes a spec of something like 1 million revs life.

Well, 1 million revs turns out to be about 2 days of constant use. The
guy was just simply wearing out the directory track!!

At that discovery we implemented automatic motor on/off control in the

hooked up a relay (with solid state relay driver) to one of the unused
outputs of one of the UARTS to turn on the motors when a call would come
in and to urn them back off when the session ended.  It worked fine.
 
Some of the earlier releases of BYE have conditionals for this

I agree 100%.  I use it for almost all of my downloads from BBSs
and my machine-to-machine transfers.  I especially like its ease of
use, and that it has Zmodem.  For my Kermit needs, I use Qterm.
Not to forget VT100 and other neat things.

Yeah, I know what you're saying about the interrupt thing.  I tried
to no avail to write an interrupt-driven routine to buffer incoming
text for the Apple ][ Plus running a SoftCard, but no dice.  But
then again, my main reason for BBSing with that machine is getting
files.

Yea, well as soon as I get the driver programs for my Trs-80 Model 4, I'll

Subject: Magazine Questions
Message-ID: <55481@bbn.COM>

I have some news and questions about magazines that cover CP/M and S-100.

I picked up what turns out to be the last issue of MicroCornucopia, this 
week.  MicroC has been referred to by several folks here as one of last 
places for articles on, and adverisements, of CP/M and S-100 products.
As with so many other magazines, their CP/M coverage had dwindled to 
nothing.  Oh well.

I looked over my sample copy of Supermicro, which is the magazine that
evolved from the S-100 journal.  I had written here last year that I
thought they weren't worth $6 an issue ($24 a year).  I'm having second 
thoughts, considering that they seem to be the *only* venue remaining 
for hardware discussion.  The issue I received, #2, includes an article
on IEEE-696 (S-100) DMA arbitration circuitry, and another on commercially-
available SCSI controllers (including Compupro and Lomas S-100).  I may 
give these guys another try.  Has anyone seen a more recent issue?  Has 
their publication schedule improved?

I've got a subscription to The Computer Journal, which is the magazine 
that Jay Sage promotes here.  I've only received one issue so far, so 
it's too early to judge.  It looks like it would be most useful to a 
Z-System aficianado.

So, I guess it's time for that age-old question.  Has anyone encountered
any other good magazines?  I'm expecially interested in hardware articles,
like the stuff that Byte *used* to publish.

I think the problem lies in TRICKLE not getting  the directories for some of
the <CPM> areas. In one area <CPM.SQUSQ> the 00-INDEX.TXT doesn't match the
directory that TRICKLE has.

If you request something that is not in TRICKLE's directory, the request is
rejected.

This seems to be the root of the problem.

 Is the program your friend is running under CP/M or NorthSatr

operating system. If CP/M I imagine it would run on another
CP/M machine or emulator, and the needed files transferred over.

The Tandon 848 1/2 height 8" floppy (used in the RS 16/6000 system, among
others) can be set to stop running after a period of time.  The BIOS has to
wait, of course, for the drive to speed up when a head load request comes
in.  It's been years since I did it, but I had a Tarbell DD controller
driving two 848-2's which were very reliable.  The same is true of other
late design drives, such as the Shugart 860, I believe.

I want to allocate the first n-blocks of a CP/M disk in sequential
order to a file in a standard CP/M directory.  What's the easiest
way to do this ?

[I want some code that writes to the disk itself by physical block
number to be able to cohabit with well-behaved things who use BDOS
the way they're supposed to on the same disk.]

Thank you all for the responses .. for commercial suppliers of Hard

unless someone at 3M has a a big hidden stack .. seems that the pri-
mary vendors have departed from that business..  My friend has a very
costy medical analysis system that depends currently on the above. 

Is there some obvious fix like a FD upgrade for this one board host
that allows soft sectored floppies to be swapped in .. orthodox fix ???

This month's (May) Computer Shopper has an ad on p. 279 for Midwestern
Diskette which has in its bulk disk offerings:
	10 & 16 Hard Sectored ................ Call
The number to call is (800)221-6332 or in Iowa, (800)332-3035.  This
company appears to be a moderate cost supplier but I have no knowledge
of the company nor am I connected with it in any way.

Subject: Thanks, and looking for Infocom

Hi

Thanks to all the people who pointed out that the S-PN2222 transistor
in my Shugart 800 is just a regular 2N2222 (if I had half a brain, I
should have figured that one out myself). New transistor is in, drive
works like a charm. Except I hardly ever use the 8" monsters these
days, given two megabyte 5.25" drives. By the way, some people claim
that there are zero or many transistors in the Shugart 800 drive, or
that they are 2N2907. Well, this one has exactly one transistor.

Next question: I seem to remember that INFOCOM wrote the ZORK line of
games, and they seem to have existed for cp/m at one point.
Question 1: Is that still the case ? If yes, can someone let me know
where to contact Infocom ? Question 2: If they are not available from
Infocom any more, does any other software distributor carry them, or
have they been released to the public domain ? Question 3: Failing the
first two questions, does anyone have some old Infocom stuff for cp/m
gathering dust, and would like to get rid of it ?

Last but not least (I ask this question every year or so, using the
Cato vs. Carthago approach): Anyone know whether the MDBS II database
software for cp/m can be had anywhere ? Anyone have an old copy they
would like to get rid of ? I called MDBS, and even talked to the
software developer who wrote it long ago. They claim not to have any
copy for cp/m left (not even an archived copy), and were pretty
unpolite.

I fear that fixing a disk drive is MUCH MUCH easier than tracking down
ancient software. But thanks in advance for any help, anyhow.

I bought an Infocom product for the IBM a year or two ago, and I got their
little "Passport" (actually a catalog) with it.  It claims that they sell the
following products on 8" disk for CP/M:
        Zork I, II, and III
        Enchanter
        Sorcerer
        Witness
        Planetfall
        Deadline
        Starcross
        Suspended
        Infidel
        Seastalker
They sell all of the above except Seastalker in DEC Rainbow CP/M format.  Most
of these are available in Osborne format as well.  And then we get to Kaypro
format.  It had all of the above plus:
        Wishbringer
        Spellbreaker
        Suspect
        Hitchhiker
        Cutthroats.
        The 4-in-1 sampler
The prices on all of the above are $14.95 except for the sampler, which is
$4.95.    Of course, this is all old information.  The brochure says to call
1-800-262-6868 for the latest pricing and availability.  Their address is:
        INFOCOM
        P.O. Box 478
        Cresskill, N.J., 07626

I hope that this helps.
