Subject: Disk Controllers, Info on.

I want a harddisk on my commodore 128 at home.
I have a full-height 20meg MFM Seagate drive (st506/412) sitting next to me. 

There are many pre-assembled hd & interfaces available, but their prices are 
high -- $800 for 20meg???  The 128 also has a cp/m (3.0) side, which would
like to use the hd.  For now, just hooking in a hard drive to the cp/m side
would be ok.

I could probably construct an SCSI port given some references to good 
books/articles.  How about SCSI --> St506/412 conversion?  Would it be
easier to build an St506/412 interface?  Any references for making an 
st506/412 interface?  

Are there any push-n-play st506/412 interfaces made for cp/m boxes?

Subject: floppy shut downers

I'm looking for two related products/projects/circuits/designs that I could
buy or build.  Both are needed for several 8 inch floppy drives I run.

1.  A circuit to turn those noisy fans on only when the boxes internal
    temperature exceeds and off when it goes below a setable value.

2.  A circuit that will turn the drive motors off after a timeout of
    inactivity, turning them back on at drive select time.

    I may have seen a product like this years ago, does anybody know
    name/availablity.  I seem to remember it might not have worked
    because some disk controllers (NEC765) continually poll the drive
    via the select line.

Looks like Telenet has finally made good on its promise to block
access to the Detroit prefix on which RCP/M Royal Oak is connected.

(I get nothing but BUSY responses from the PC-P outdial when
trying Royal Oak, but a call placed at the same time long distance
rings.)

I'll be contacting Telenet protesting; BFD.  Need to pass the word

I admire your enthusiasm, but I think you are underestimating the
difficulties of building your own ST506 interface.  I mean, would you
build your own floppy disk controller?  The hard drive controller (ST506
side of things) is a whole lot more difficult due to the timing.  The extra
10-pin cable which carries the read/write data is separate for a reason:
data is moving awful damn fast at 3600rpm.  They make chips to handle this
interface, but I can't think of any off-hand.

The SCSI port side is almost as difficult.  SCSI is a command language of
sorts: you say which LOGICAL sector you want to read/write, and the
controller card computes the actual head/track/sector, seeks to it, and
read/writes it.  You tell it to format the drive, and off it goes.  This can
get pretty sophisticated if it supports disconnect/reconnect.  There is a
nice chip that takes care of this side pretty well made by NCR; number might
be 5830, but I am not positive.  However, this chip is made to interface and
be operated by a microprocessor and is not a stand-alone converter.

So, you need a microcontroller, SCSI (maybe on the same chip) and ST506
stuff.  Plus, all the microprogram to make it work.  And that is how the
commercial products do it for the most part.  The hardware gurus I know
refuse to mess with this due to the difficulty and buy completed boards
(usually at swap meets).

Anyway, good luck, but thought I would warn you.

E-mailing you did not seem to work, so I am posting instead.

I am not sure about GOOD terminal programs for the Kaypro 10 and 84
series, but I used to use a home-brew one which emulated VT100.  (This
was before I made a termcap entry for the Kaypro 2/2x/4/10 on our un*x
system.)  It's quite stupid in that all it does is talk to the serial
port, exiting via two ^_ if I remember correctly.  Baud is set via the
command line at startup.  If this is what you are looking for, let me know.

In addition, I believe that simtel20 may also have one for the Kaypro
on-line already.  Keith would know more about that.

>PS. Any experiences of having a 30-70 Mb hard-disk installed on
>Kaypro 10? How to do it and are the costs reasonable?

Well, you can't do it without replacing the ROM that came with it.  There are
two aftermarket ROMs that are decent: KayPLUS by MICROCode and TurboROM by
Plu*Perfect.  Both have the capability to support up to two 64M drives (the
limit of the WD-1002 card).  The format/install programs are included in the
KayPLUS package and are available for an additional fee for the TurboROM.
I can tell you where to get either of these, but I suggest comparing them
first to see which suits your needs better.  I have a table put out by
CTM (?) in an article some years back comparing four ROMs for the Kaypro,
which I can post if you like.

As far as the cost - assuming the K10 already has a 10M hard drive (as it
should) - you only need buy a hard drive which has a standard ST506
interface (besides the ROM).

Is there any support for the TCP/IP family of protocols for CP/M?  I
would like a program or programs which support FTP, TELNET, and SMTP
which speak TCP/IP using SLIP over an asynchronous line.  I already
have a similar PD package for MSDOS, but that doesn't help me at home.
My home system is a Commodore 128 running under CP/M.  I'm using my
own modified BIOS which gets around the Pet-AScii ridiculousness.  I

All of SD systems S-100 stuff seems to suffer these sorts of troubles!
I have an SD SBC-200 CPU card that will not even work with SD Expand-

EPROM blaster to run with the SD card.  Hah.....fat chance!  All it was

     All my Compupro stuff is the same way.  Remember that the REFRSH line
went the way of the front panel stuff when 696 came out.  It's the
responsibility of each dynamic memory card to provide its own refresh
logic, not the processor's.  Under 696, you don't even know for sure that
the processor is on the bus... it may have been put to sleep by a DMA
controller somewhere else in the system, or perhaps by a TBM ( temporary
bus master ).

     Look at your Expandoram.  No refresh logic.  I know... I've got one
right here.

     Why are you complaining about having to use static memory, anyway?

Some years ago I (my employer) bought several SCSI adapters for the Ampro
Little Board, a CPM single board computer.  (They plug in between the Z80A
and its socket).   Now Ampro supplies them, too.  The Ampro  Identification
is SCSI/PLUS Z80 ADAPTER: Model 1AX,  cost was $109.00.  I don't know if
that includes software.   

I bought mine (before Ampro Introduced theirs) from Media Distributing,
made by NeuRahn, Inc.  The price was about the same,  included software.

Subject: Need TCP/IP for CP/M

Many readers believe TCP/IP is simply too big for the CP/M environment;
in fact, small implementations fit.  In mid-1986, I ported Geoffrey
Cooper's TINYTCP to CP/M, fixing a number of protocol errors in the
process.  TINYTCP has a trivial IP layer, and a retransmission policy
that can only be described as mindless, but it seems to work.  It is
written entirely in C.

I never bothered to implement a SLIP interface, but applications can
talk to each other through the loopback interface.  A .COM file
containing:

    - TCP/IP,
    - the loopback driver,
    - two trivial test applications that exchange TCP segments, and
    - a packet trace printer,

compiled with the Z80 version of Aztec C 1.06D, is 18048 bytes long.

Subject: GOOD terminal program(s) for Kaypro 10?

I'm thinking of purchasing a Kaypro 10, but first I'd like to know
if there were any good terminal programs for it? I just want to have
one which is capable of handling at least 2400bps, but speeds like
4800 and 9600 would be almost necessary also. It should be
vt100-compatible also, so, some kind of a vt100 terminal emulator. I
don't need any download protocols or such stuff, because there's
always MEX for things like downloading, redialing etc.

Please e-mail me if you have such a program (it should be
PD), or know where I could get one. Otherwise that Kaypro'll be
almost useless...

PS. Any experiences of having a 30-70 Mb hard-disk installed on
Kaypro 10? How to do it and are the costs reasonable?

well, first, here is a possible fix (from the manual):
"Symptoms: The CPU card fails to operate with some dynamic memory
cards at 4 MHz, and operates erratically with some disk controller cards
at all operating clock rates."

"Cause: <noise removed, summary is: they latched sWO*, sMEMR, and sINP
using IC U40 (for rev C, anyway), a 7475/74LS75, clocked by pSYNCH.
Quoting now: "The manual fails to mention that this takes the CPU board
out of IEEE timing specifications">

"Cure: remove IC U40 and install a 16-pin dip header with jumpers installed
between pins 2/16, 3/15, 6/10, 7/9.  This removes the latch and does not
introduce a pSYNCh delay for these signals"

BTW, you GOTTA do this if you have an SD systems Expandoram II or the
Jade DD disk controller (neat, huh? *THEIR* cards don't even work together!).

There is also a fix for erratic reset (use a different cap value for C22),
and for any problems with the serial port at 4 MHz (get a better 8251).

JRT Pascal was not designed to create .COM files, as I remember.
I had versions 2.0 and 3.0, sold off last year at a swap meet.
Your best bet is to go to Turbo Pascal, which is ever so much
more supported in the public domain.  You'll get the advantage of
a compiled language instead of JRT, which contains a byte-code
interpreter (again as I remember), within EXECUTE.COM so that is
the only way to run your programs.

I would be willing to bet that you can find a used CP/M version of
Turbo Pascal, version 2 or 3 for under $40 at a local swap meet,
WITH the manuals.

How to make COM files with JRT PAscal?

You can't.

If you want to know what their linker does, just read the Users Guide,
page 118 for Release 3.0. It will just build ONE executable .INT file
from several (if you don't "LINK", it defers the loading of invoked
INTs until the program needs them). This isn't what is usually named a
linker.  Your IN2 file is a RENAMEd copy of the original main program
file. The new main INT is a concatenation of the original main INT
with eventual additional modules (such as TAN,LOG, you name them).

Subject: Kermit

I assembled a Kermit kit from SIMTEL20, about six weeks ago, for 
installation on a Northstar Horizon.  I used the HEX files, rather 
than build from the source, since I was using a 1200-baud phone line 
and only have two floppy drives.  The files loaded, and the resulting
program executes with only one small problem.  Each character received
by the modem port is results in a capital-D being sent back through the
modem port.  The character appears on the screen as sent, and characters
typed on the keyboard go out the modem port priperly.  I suspect that
the modem port read routine is doing it, but it isn't apparent from the
source.  Has anyone else had this problem?  Has anyone successfully 
installed Kermit on the Northstar?

I adapted a design some umpteen years ago that controlled standard 8" drives
which had no motor control.  I am talking about the older AC drives (such as
Shugarts).

The circuit, which was published at that time in my column in MicroCornucopia,
used the select lines from a Xerox/Kaypro to determine if the motor should
be spinning.  Since the select lines in these machines is an artifact of the
ROM (direct control of side select and drive, not through a disk controller),
timeout was handled on the BIOS side of things.  The circuit is easily adapted
to have its own motor timeout, though.

The circuit - at that time - consisted of a triac, diac, optoisolator, and a
of couple capacitors, resistors, and diodes for TTL logic to control AC.
This can probably all be done in one hybrid part these days.

I have been using this circuit in two different machines pretty much daily
for 6 years now with no problems.  I *will not* tolerate drives that spin
when not active.

By the way, how much for the SA850/851 2-drive combo?  Power supply and
cabinet included?

It's me again. If anyone wants a generic ProDOS hard disk
driver for PCPI CP/M (tested with SCSI disk partitions --
very nice, if I do say so myself), drop me a line. You need
to do some DDT to get it up and running, but it's nothing
strenuous, and it does work, for devices 16 meg or less, and
they must be non-removable. Additionally, a STATUS call must
properly return the number of blocks on the device (if memory
serves, most will do this anyway).

I'm working on a new-and-improved version of the 3.5" unidisk
driver as well. Note that the current version floating around
does not properly accept write-protected disks.

From: uop!mrapple@ucdavis.ucdavis.edu  (Nick Sayer)
Subject: A PCPI revolution

For the longest time, I have been unhappy with the way that
overlays and inserts for serial I/O under Apple CP/M were written.
No installation file seemed to be right without being hacked
to bits to make it fit. PCPI CP/M has such a nice drivers
facility, it seems a waste not to put it to full use. I
discovered the trouble with this idea is that the drivers don't
include proper calls for setting baud rate, sending breaks, and
checking carrier (among other things), so alas, we're back
to peeks and pokes again.

Well, since writing the patches to get MEX, BYE and IMP talking
to my IIgs modem ports (which require firmware calls, and really
don't allow direct hardware access), I decided to try writing a
driver with some extended commands to deal with those non-standard
requests, such as setting baud, PSW (parity, stop and wordlen),
checking carrier, sending break, lowering DTR momentarily, and
dialing.

For my idea to be of any use at all, it seems to me we ought to
set a standard about this sort of thing. If we all agree on how the
extra commands are to be called, we can wrap this whole thing up
quickly. The advantage is that overlays for MEX, BYE, IMP and other
such programs will have only one overlay for PCPI CP/M -- and it
won't take an inordinant amount of hacking to get it to work.

I therefore propose that such drivers be the same as ordinary character
drivers (to insure backwards compatability) except for some changes:

1. the character write routines should be transparant -- they should
not respond to "Ctrl-A" type commands.

2. Character drivers have "other" commands available that are usually
not implemented. Let's implement them like this:

COMMAND E5 - check driver. This command should return an 80H if
the driver conforms to this standard, except for the pickup and dial
calls (it is a serial port and can't by itself do such things) or
81H if it will pickup and dial also (as is the case for the Apple Cat
Micromodem, or other such devices).

COMMAND 10 - set baud rate. This command takes 1 byte paramater -
the baud rate to set as in the table below. Returns non-zero if the
baud rate requested is not available.

01 - 50 baud            08 - 1200 baud
02 - 75  baud           09 - 1800 baud
03 - 110 baud           10 - 2400 baud
04 - 134.5 baud         11 - 3600 baud
05 - 150 baud           12 - 4800 baud
06 - 300 baud           13 - 7200 baud
07 - 600 baud           14 - 9600 baud
			15 - 19200 baud

COMMAND 11 - set PSW. This command takes 1 byte paramater - the
PSW settings. The hi nibble is the data format (stop and wordlen)
and the lo nibble is the parity setting.

    hi nibble                lo nibble
00 - 8 bits, 1 stop       00 - no parity
01 - 7 bits, 1 stop       01 - odd parity
02 - 6 bits, 1 stop       03 - even parity
03 - 5 bits, 1 stop       05 - mark parity
04 - 8 bits, 2 stop       07 - space parity
05 - 7 bits, 2 stop
06 - 6 bits, 2 stop
07 - 5 bits, 2 stop

These values were chosen because they conform nicely to the 6551
and the IIgs firmware request values (same with the baud values)

COMMAND 12 - check carrier. No paramaters. return non-zero if carrier
OK.

COMMAND 13 - send break. No paramaters. return 0 if completed ok

COMMAND 14 - hangup. No paramaters. Return 0 if completed ok. for
serial ports, lower DTR for 300 msec.

The following commands active only if command E5 returned 81

COMMAND 15 - pickup. one paramater. if non-zero, establish
answer mode. If 0, originate.

COMMAND 16 - dial. 1 byte paramater. ASCII character to dial.
I suggest that if the ascii character "T" is sent, switch to
tone if available, "P" for pulse. characters "0"-"9", "*" and "#"
represent legal digits. Other commands may be added (such as
a flash-hook command, or a pause, etc).

To dial a number, pickup in originate mode, dial, then wait for
the carrier to appear. If no carrier before timeout, hangup.

-----

I have such a driver available for the IIgs serial port, the
Super Serial card, as well as a MEX overlay for such a driver.
BYE is coming soon. If someone with an Applecat and PCPI and
someone else with a Micromodem and PCPI would write one too,
we could get this whole thing off the ground nicely. The driver
facility is just too convenient and useful for this sort of thing
to let it go unused.

Thanks for reading this whole thing. Both of you. :-}

Subject: Profiles being SOLD!!

I received a letter on 12/14/88 from Profiles magazine stating:
"NOTICE OF RETURN OF PAYMENT FOR SUBSCRIPTION TO PROFILES MAGAZINE"

"Thank you for your interest in ProFiles Magazine.  The staff and management
appreciates you choosing to subscribe.  However, ProFiles is currently in
transition and in the process of being sold.  Therefore, we are returning your
check."

I for one have been subscribing to this Kaypro oriented magazine since I
purchased my Kaypro 2X business pak in November of 1984.  Even though
it's now predominantly MS-DOS oriented I still subscribed and enjoyed
the magazine (despite there lack of CP/M information).  Has anyone else
heard anything about Profiles or Kaypro for that matter?  What other CP/M
oriented magazines are there out there?  If ProFiles is possibly
discontinued, where can I turn?  Please send me names and addresses of
other CP/M magazines and their subscription rates if possible.

REf:  PRofiles being sold.
   It is truly discouraging for a CPM user to see the last vestiges of
information disappearing.  There are two suggestions I have for Rhonda.
First, subscribe to the Computer Journal, PO Box 1697, Kalispell, MT
59903.  Subscription price is $16/yr for bimonthly issues.  The second
is to call what is commonly refered to as a Z-node.  The one I would
suggeest is run by a guy Named Jay Sage.  (617-965-7259) This will put
you in touch with the only major programming/informational activity in
the CPM world (I think).  The folks involved with the Z-nodes have
developed a new Command Processor and disk operating system which gives
tremendous capabilities to a standard CPM machine.  Even if you are an
appliance user (not interested in programming, etc), this modification
to your operating system can make your work significantly more enjoyable
and productive.  The BBS will also provide you with the information (and
more) that you used to get from Profiles.  The Computer Journal will
give you information on CPM systems as well as updates on what is
happening in the ZCPR world through outstanding articles written bye Jay
Sage.  I wish you the best, and don't give up ship.

I am looking for a technical manual that includes schematics

home built host adapter.  It worked real well for almost a year and
then just died on me.  I have tried to get info from Micropolis
without sucess so far.  I would like to take a crack at fixing
this thing,  but because of it's age,  will not spend too much
but start looking for a replacement instead.

Date: Mon 19 Dec 1988 09:35:54 EDT
From: <SAGE@LL.ARPA>
Subject: CP/M Magazines

   I was in the process of preparing my own response to the news that Kaypro
was discontinuing Profiles Magazine when I saw Ric Lewallen's very
flattering comments about The Computer Journal.  (Thank you, Ric.  I have
tried to contact you directly, but DOCKMASTER and LL only rarely agree to
talk to each other.)
 
   A great many of us who are still active 8-bit Z80-compatible computer
enthusiasts have chosen TCJ as our medium of communication.  It has been
around for many years but was almost entirely unknown.  I have been writing
a regular column on the Z-System (an advanced CP/M-compatible operating
system replacement) for about two years now.  Several issues back, Bridger
Mitchell -- author of such spectacular programs as BackGrounder,
DateStamper, JetFind, and DosDisk -- began a regular column on advanced CP/M
topics.
 
   Beginning with the issue due out any day now, a new dimension will be
added.  Rick Charnes, who has a charming writing style and who, unlike
Bridger and me, is a non-programmer, will be starting what will probably be
a regular column on application issues.  He will describe how he milks every
bit of available performance out of programs and operating system
facilities.  Personally, I don't really care much what Rick writes about --
his writing is just so enjoyable I would read about any topic.  I
particularly remember a delightful piece recounting the woes that befell him
after eating chop suey within splatter distance of his keyboard.
 
   Anyway, TCJ is already a really nice magazine for people interested in
8-bit computing, and I expect it will continue to improve as we build the
circulation and continue to build up the editorial staff.  I should add that
it does not cover 8-bit stuff exclusively.  There is a little bit of MS-DOS
and MAC stuff as well, and there are articles on other machines, like the
National 32032.  Some articles deal with generic issues, such as programming
languages (I think a regular series of column on Modula-2 will be
appearing).
 
   Ric Lewallen mentioned my Z-Node in Newton, MA at 617-965-7259.  It is
available via the MABOS PC-Pursuit outdial.  One extra fact you might need
to know is that there is an initial connect password.  The prompt -- the
name of the Dynamic Debugging program in CP/M-2 -- pretty much gives it
away.  It is there mainly to keep the not-so-serious types away.  In case
you are not a programmer or use CP/M-Plus (which comes with the SID debugger
instead), the program is DDT.  Once you are on the system, it is completely
open.  There are no private messages (except to the sysop), and the file
area is immediately accessible.  By making extensive use of the Z-System's
aliasing facility, almost any reasonable form of any command will work on
the system.  For example, you can locate files using FILE, FIND, FINDF,
FINDFILE, WHEREIS, WIS, etc.  They all invoke the same FF.COM program.  We
try to make it as easy to use as possible.
 
   On entering the operating system, you will see a message offering callers
a $2 discount on new subscriptions to TCJ when the order is left on the
board (the command is ORDER).  Sage Microsystems East, sponsor of the Z-
Node, wants to do its part to built up TCJ.
 
   A little additional information on what is happening with Profiles.  It
is my understanding that current subscribers will be offered two
alternatives.  The MS-DOS people will be able to have their subscriptions
switched over to a specific one of the regular DOS magazines (I don't know
which it is).  CP/Mers will be able to join the Kaypro Group of the Boston
Computer Society at a one-time reduced membership fee.  That group, known as
BOSKUG, actually supports many computers.  My BCS CP/M group, the BCS
Osborne group, and an independent Morrow group have all merged into the
original BOSKUG.  Since both Kaypros and Osbornes come in MS-DOS flavors as
well, the group has both CP/M and MS-DOS subgroups.  I am now the director
of the CP/M subgroup.
 
   BOSKUG is a very nice, small, friendly group.  If you are in the greater
Boston area, you should stop by some time at one of the meetings.  As our
national membership expands, we will be making a major effort to serve the
needs of people who cannot attend our meetings by offering a variety of
services in addition to meetings.  The BOSKUG magazine, called the KUGEL, is
quite nice, with a good mix of material -- less technical than TCJ, more
emphasis on software reviews and news.  Kaypro has donated its most powerful
computer to serve as a new, multi-line BBS system.  It will be operating
from my house (that will make three BBS lines and two voice lines in one
little house -- hope the telephone pole can support all those wires -- hope
the phone company has that many wires).

Since Balcones Computer (?) wrote the OS and BIOS, I think it would

Subject: floppy shut downers

Wow! Mitch talks about some horrendous circuit using a basement full of
components just to turn a drive motor on & off!   :-) :-)

What I did to handle this situation required a single PNP transistor and
a DIP style relay from Rat Shack. Hook one end of the relay to +5, the
other to the emitter of the transistor. It need not be a big transistor,
only a few milliamps are needed by the relay. Hook the collector of the
transistor to ground and the base to your motor control line. If your
drive controller does not offer a motor control line you will have to
add a 555 timer circuit to this kludge, with the trigger hooked to the
drive select (an OR will be required for multiple drive installations).
Anyway, most drive controllers do support a motor control line, even if
the BIOS has not implemented the timeout. It's up to you whether to hack
on the BIOS or the 555 circuit.

How to connect or receive files from simtel20? I've got an access to both
unix and vms-systems, any possibility to reach simtel20 by earn, in
real-time? Does receiving files/directories/other info work via uucp mail in

I'm working in the university's computer store so ordering the roms won't be
difficult, but a telefax number etc would be of great help. That CTM-table
could be very helpful, so if you find it please enclose it in mail. As the
capacity of those two 64mb drives seems to suit fine for me, that rom

I have seen (and have) a copy of a packet radio package for the Xerox 820-I
written in 8080 assembler intended for compilation under CP/M.  I do not 
remember much about it; I would assume that the Royal Oak BBS would have a
more up-to-date copy.  I also know that several people have ported XINU to
CP/M systems and have seen discussion of Comer's second book on netoworks
that I assume uses XINU as the OS.

Following is a public letter to Telenet's Dave Purks, which I posted in

Subject: (R) MIDET            
Message class: Public             Message base: prod

Dave,
 
I realize you must receive dozens of messages daily on the subject of
the recent changes in PC Pursuit outdial exchange restrictions, e.g. in
the suburban Detroit (MIDET) area.  And I have seen Telenet's "stock"
response about the high costs of nonlocal outdial connections and the
long-available list of supported exchanges in the EXCHANGE.TXT file.
However, I would like to remind you of a message I sent you nearly a
year ago (on the "old" Net Exchange), regarding one particular BBS in
the MIDET area.
 
That BBS is Keith Petersen's and Bob Clyne's RCP/M Royal Oak, at
313/759-6569.  "Royal Oak" is one of the oldest and most prestigious
continuously-functioning BBS systems in the country.  It is a
non-profit, non-passworded system, dedicated solely to file transfer of
public domain software for those interested in the CP/M operating
system (and its derivatives) for 8-bit microcomputers.
 
Sysop Keith Petersen's name should be familiar to you.  He is the
original author of XMODEM, the CP/M program which contributed the
popular name to Ward Christensen's ubiquitous file transfer protocol.
And Keith is the longtime overseer of the MS-DOS and CP/M public domain
archives on the SIMTEL20 mainframe computer at White Sands Missile
Range, which provides free file transfer service to thousands of users
on the DARPA Internet network.  Keith also moderates several prominent
ARPA mailing lists which are gatewayed to tens of thousands of systems
connected through the worldwide USENET network.
 
I wish to plead special consideration for this particular BBS system
due to its singular importance to the CP/M user community.  The number
of quality remote access systems which cater to CP/M users has dwindled
substantially in recent years.  The accessibility of RCP/M Royal Oak
via PC Pursuit service has been a real boon to the many Telenet
customers nationwide who still operate "antique" 8-bit systems (and who
do not have access to the aforementioned private networks).  The Royal
Oak system serves as a major central distribution point for new
CP/M-based software, in large part because of Telenet access which
(until just recently) has been available since the inception of PC
Pursuit service.
 
While the loss of a single outdial exchange might have little effect on
(for example) IBM-PC/MS-DOS system users, it has a major impact on the
declining population of CP/M users.  In your reply to my earlier
message on this subject (prior to installation of the 313-759 exchange
restriction), you indicated that you would "keep that exchange in mind
when I begin programming the block outs."  I don't know if that was
simply politeness on your part, or if my request was overlooked among
the many others you have received.  But if it is at all possible to
program the outdial restrictors to allow special access to an
individual BBS system, you could not find a system which is more
deserving of special consideration than RCP/M Royal Oak.  And many
hundreds of PC Pursuit subscribers will be gratified by restoration of
access to this important system, upon which we have come to rely during
nearly three years of continuous service.
 
Please pass this message on to Peter Naleszkiewicz, and thank you for
any consideration you or he may be able to provide in this matter.
 
Very truly yours,

Amazing, it sounds as if these people have some integrity.  You are

Sadly, Rhonda, there's not much out there anymore.  You might give

I have recently "discovered" SIMTEL20 and it looks VERY interesting!!
When all the world turns to MSDOS, it feels good to see some place having
some CP/M software!
Nice work!

But... I have a question and before searching through all the directories,
perhaps someone could help me:

I have recently downloaded a couple of .LBRs and I have nulu and related
programs. But all the entries in the libraries seem to be packed, they all
have the extension .?Z?.
What program(s) do I need to unpack them?
(BTW I have an SB180FX with ZSystem, not plain CP/M)

Subject: Recovering Erased CP/M Files

If I understand your question correctly, you want to know if
there is any part of the directory structure or reserved area
of the disk that records which blocks are in use.
  There is no explicit list as in MSDOS or TRSDOS. However,
  the BDOS maintains a bitmap of allocation blocks that it
  obtains from the directory entries. One side effect is that
  under CP/M one can have files that are linked for a single
  allocation block, and different for later blocks. If you
  erase one of these linked files, you have the risk of having
  the BDOS bitmap showing the allocation blocks as being free,
  when they really are not. I don't know of cases where the blocks
  can be marked as used when they should be free. I assume that
  the bitmap is updated or recreated after a control-C and relogging
  the disk, but I'm not sure. When I've had disks that had linked
  files ( easy to do after unerasing ) I've played it safe and rebooted
  after erasing what I did not want.

My question is:
How is free disk space managed?

Reason for this question:
Some time ago, I had some problems with a self-written program
that caused blocks to be souped-up without being registered in a
directory entry.
What I mean by that is that these blocks seem to be marked as "in use"
but not being actually in use.
At that time I felt the need for a UN*X-like fsck-program for
my system (SB180FX with Z-System).

Several years ago I wrote an "fsck" equivalent for mpm-80 (multi-user cpm)
in PL/M. I have since converted it to C for CCPM-86. This utility checks
for multiple files allocated to the same disk blocks, scrambled directory
entries, other stuff. If there is any interest I will post the source.

Who's complaining??  Static is just fine....now.  But in the bad old

Subject: GEnie -- another CP/M resource 

Ric Lewallen and Jay Sage have described some of the vigorous CP/M
activity concentrated at several of the "Z-Node" remote CP/M systems.
In addition to serving as technical meeting places for some of the
most active CP/M software developers today, these are boards where new
users are almost sure to get a friendly response and hand.

Another excellent source of CP/M information, help, and user-group
software (over 4500 files) is the National CP/M RoundTable on GEnie,
which is accessible in the U.S., Canada, and Japan through the GEISCO
network at 300 and 1200 bps.

The Bulletin Board area has several user groups to answer
machine-specific questions for the TRS-80 using CP/M, Heath/Zenith,
Kaypro, Osborne, Visual-1050, Commodore C128 using CP/M, Apple using
CP/M, Atari using CP/M, and a category to discuss ZCPR3, ZRDOS, and
the Z-SYSTEM.

A particular strength of the CP/M Roundtable is the depth of
experience that the four SysOps bring to the system.  Keith Petersen,
surely known to everyone on this list, guides the overall CP/M
activities.  He is backed up by	Bill Duerr (All CP/M), Bill Juliani
(Commodore C128 CP/M), and Jim Lill (Apple CP/M and Z-System).

Since late October, the normal $29.95 signup fee for U.S. users has
been waived (this waiver may be terminated soon, however).  This means
you can sample the system at very low cost.  To get this free signup
you do this:

1. Set your Terminal software for LOCAL ECHO/Half Duplex at 300 or 1200 baud.
2. Dial (toll free)  800-638-8369.  Upon connection, enter HHH
3. At the U#= prompt, enter XJM11890,GENIE and press RETURN.

GEnie is available without monthly charge and without any hidden extra
charges for $5 per hour for both 300 and 1200 baud.  You will be able
to order a GEnie manual online or download one from the online manual.
If you need additional assistance, call 800-638-9636 (voice).

Several Xerox 16/8 users have asked me if DosDisk can be configured to
run on that machine.  I don't know, and I'm told the machine is being
remaindered at attractive prices.  Can someone with access to the bios
help with these questions:

Can the BIOS's logical and physical disk parameters can be externally
set, or overlaid, to permit foreign format disks to be used?

Can we obtain a complete copy of the ram and rom portions of the BIOS?

Would someone with advanced assembly language experience wish to volunteer
to write the DosDisk overlay for the 16/8?

----

DosDisk (from Plu*Perfect Systems) is a resident system extension for
CP/M 2.2 and CP/M Plus that allows a 360K MS-DOS format disk to be
DIRECTLY used in a DSDD drive.  Essentially all CP/M programs can
read/write the dos disk, transparently.  Files in subdirectories can
be accessed, too, and on DateStamper computers the MS-DOS datestamps
maintained.

Alas a simple answer: it isn't. At least not on disk. Each time a new
disk is logged on, BDOS scans the complete directory to find out what
parts are used, and builds a block-based-bitmap. This is why CP/M
refuses to write on a disk that it hasn't been logged on yet. Most CP/M
systems use some kind of CRC check on the directory to find out if a
disk has been swapped. BDOS/BIOS design allows for a `drive door open'
interrupt. Read any `System Programmers Manual' on the BIOS.

Well, no fear for that. As soon as you re-log the disk, all non-
confirmed changes will be forgotten. What you might get is a dummy
file, but no CP/M I know of registers Blocks as `in use' other than
by putting them in a directory entry. It may be that the memory
based bitmap was updated and not the disk, but one `^C' at
prompt level should clear that out.
Maybe somebody can write a small program that compares the bitmap to
the info found in the directory, creating a `LOSTFILE.DAT' from
the overallocated blocks. The bitmap can be found through the
Drive Table.

Balcones Computer only wrote the BIOS and ROM for the 820-II.  As far as
getting hold of them, good luck.  Jim Ferguson (of BigBoard fame among other
things) told me many years ago that they wrote the code, collected BIG bucks
for it from Xerox, and went away.  He did not say whether Balcones existed or
not anymore, but it sounds like they are gone.

Personally, I have found little use for the 8086 card in the 820-II due to
its anemic RAM and so generic MS-DOS that few IBM programs in recent memory
run on it.  You are better off putting together a clone.

On the other hand, I have found a use for the slot to install extra bankable
memory that my OS can use.

Your circuit makes me think you misunderstood, so a few comments:

(1) You assume the 8-inch drives have a motor control line.  No
early 8-inch drives have such a puppy.  In fact, most newer ones don't
either.

(2) The change has been to go from AC motors (on the old 8" drives) to DC
motors with built-in motor control.  My circuit is for AC.  Using a relay to
control two 8" 120v AC drive motors should introduce some nice backward
current which will help destroy your relay contacts, not to mention the noise
introduced by same.  However, it can be done as you suggest provided the
appropriate feedback diode and capacitor are added.

Call me biased, but I happen to hate moving parts which means I use a
mechanical relay as a last resort. :-) :-)

(3) Finally, the Xerox computer has no motor control line.  Period.  Not even
for 5.25" drives.  5.25" drives have to be strapped for "motor on select"
rather than using the "motor control" line.  Of course for this, you don't
need any circuit.

Otherwise, I see no problem with your solution.

Subject: Monday *NOT* PCP Holiday

A phone call to Telenet Customer Service (1-800-367-0437) on Saturday
confirmed that Monday, December 26 and Monday, January 2 are **NOT**
holidays for PC Pursuit billing purposes.

You must suspend your use of the Telenet network at the usual time on
Monday or be faced with humongous daytime billings on your next bill.

Everyone seemed to be assuming that since the holidays fell on Sunday
this year and were legally observed on Monday that Telenet would follow
suit. Not true.

You have been warned. Pass the word to your local users please, and as
a courtesy to others you might dump this message to a few of your local
BBS'. It might be a nice Christmas present for an unsuspecting PCP'er.

Subject: Zcpr & High Level Languages

Does anyone have suggestions for a graceful way in which to pass the
address of a ZCPR 3.x environment descriptor to a program written in a
high level language, so that the program can make use of the various ZCPR
facilities?  Specifically, rather than hard-wiring the environment
descriptor address into the program, thus making it non-portable, what
would be a good way for a utility written in bds-c to learn the
environment descriptor address?


Discussion:
----------

As some of you know, an assembly language program using the zcpr
environment is written with a header which tells the command processor
that it is a 'Z3ENV' program.  At run time, the command processor plugs
the environment descriptor address into a specific location in this
header; now the program contains the address needed to get information on
its environment.

Since the object code of a program compiled under bds-c starts with the
bds runtime package, there seems to be no way to create the required
header, other than (perhaps) relocating the runtime package and finding
some way to link in a header underneath the package.  I have not yet
played with this approach, but it does not seem very fruitful, since 1)
the bds documentation indicates that all code must run directly above the
runtime package, and 2) even if it could be done, relocating the runtime
package would require a full reassembly and/or recompilation of the
libraries, making them completely non-standard.

A second mechanism for communicating the environment descriptor address
from the command processor to a transient program apparently exists.
Inspection of the source code for ZCPR 3.3 (I haven't checked other
versions, yet) reveals that when zcpr 'calls' the transient program,
register pair HL contains the desired address.  However, upon entry into
the runtime package, this register is immediately clobbered.

Any ideas, suggestions, or further discussion would be appreciated.  If I
receive mail on this subject, I will summarize to the net.

Thanks.

DU (latest version 89 or so) will need a harddisk that your BIOS
talks to. It has a search command, and a command to save sectors into
a CP/M file. It's not automated, but is do-able. You can get DU from  
the Sintel-20 archives. There are various other diskzapper programs
about, but DU is a standard.

     The *easiest* way is to code a loop that begins at the top of memory
and scans downwards for the string "Z3ENV".  As long as you're between the
BIOS and the top of memory, the only place that that string should appear
is at address ENV+3.  That'll give you the environment address.

     Note that this technique is *extremely* dangerous on any system that
supports memory-mapped I/O ( i.e. Apple CP/M ), for obvious reasons.

     This technique is not new.  Several of the Z-System utilities include
a routine called FENV.  This is the _F_ind _ENV_ironment routine, originally
developed by Joe Wright.  The first program I saw use this technique was a
version of LX.

     Note that this method *should* work under NZ-COM, as long as you use
the address of the pseudo BIOS, rather than the real one.

Two tools not already mentioned, of possible use to you are:

The DU utility's M (map) command will show allocation blocks that

one directory entry.

The SAP utility (5.3 or later) will alphabetize a directory.

Subject: Finding the Z Environment

   Mark Wilson's proposed method for determining the Z3ENV address by
scanning high memory is a suggestion in the right direction, but it ignores
some very important details.  A program I tried using recently failed on my
system because it used the very scheme Mark describes.
 
   ENV+3 is not the only place in memory where the string "Z3ENV" may occur. 
On my system I have a directory with that name (it's where I work on the
source code for the ENV module).  A user might have loaded that name into
one of the four system file names in the message buffer.  There might be a
reference to "Z3ENV" in a pending command line in the multiple command line
buffer.  The disk deblocking buffers in the BIOS might happen to contain
this string if a file had been accessed that contained that text.  In short,
there are quite a few other places where such a string might appear.
 
   ONE CANNOT ASSUME THAT ANYTHING ONE IS LOOKING FOR IS UNIQUE!  It is
always necessary to validate the address that one thinks is the ENV.  This
can be done by looking at the word in offset 1BH in the assumed ENV
descriptor.  That is where the ENV address itself is stored in the ENV. 
This might have seemed redundant; after all, if you know where the ENV is,
why do you need to look it up in the ENV?  This is one good reason.
 
   So, the strategy comes down to this.  Determine the range of memory to be
scanned and the direction.  Then scan for the string "Z3ENV".  When it is
found, assign an address 3 lower as the tentative ENV address.  Add 1BH to
this, and see if the word there is the same ENV address.  If it is, you can
be pretty sure that you have the ENV.  If not, continue the scan where you
left off last time.
 
   There are probably various arguments that could be made as to what range
of memory should be scanned and in which direction.  Joe Wright has
experimented with putting Z-System modules (notably the FCP) in an RSX that
lives not only below the BIOS but below the command processor.  To cover
such a case, the lower bound in memory should probably be the bottom of
protected memory, namely, the address stored at location 0006H.  From here
one would have to scan up all the way to FF03H (the highest possible
location for a two-record ENV descriptor).  Scanning up is probably safer
than scanning down, I think, since it would be less likely to hit memory-
mapped I/O before finding the ENV.
 
   I suppose there is always a slight chance that this procedure will detect
the image of a different ENV descriptor whose file was examined and happens
to be in the BIOS deblocking buffer.  It would be hard to prevent this kind
of problem.  That memory image would, indeed, pass every test for an ENV
module since it is, in fact, such a module.  However, this would be unlikely
in general and virtually impossible if one has just loaded a transient
program, since its code would be in the buffer.

From: Bridger Mitchell <bridger%rcc@rand.org>
Subject: Passing Z3ENV to BDS-C

David O Goodman requested suggestions for passing the system's
external environment address to a BDS-C or other high level
language application.

This is a sketch of an approach that should be usable with most any
existing .COM file.  It requires patching together the final .COM
(after linking the BDS-C relocatable modules)j.

The standard Z-System application begins with this structure
(addresses are when loaded to 0100h):

	0100:	jp	start		; 
	0103:	db	'Z3ENV',1	; signature for ZCPR command processor
	0109:	dw	0000		; where ZCPR puts z3env address

When the ZCPR 3.3 or 3.4 command processor loads a COM file to 100h
and finds the 'Z3ENV' signature at 103 it "installs" the z3env
external environment address at 109.

Append a copy of the first 10 bytes of the linked .COM file to the end
of the file.  Follow that with some startup code:

	image100:
		ds	10

	start:	ld	hl,(0109)		; save z3env address
		ld	xxxx,hl			; at a known, safe location
		ld	hl,image100		; restore the original
		ld	de,100			; code at 100
		ld	bc,10
		ldir
		jp	100			; and execute it

The address xxxx needs to be known, at compile/link time, 
to your HLL routines.  On most systems 003Bh will be ok, just following
the RST 38 jump location.  Another possibility is to check the BDS-C
runtime library's locations for storing pointers to the parsed
command line.  I remember there being room for perhaps 30 pointers; in
almost any application the 30th should be free!

I believe this patching process can be largely automated into a ZEX
script that loads a debugger, which then loads the .COM image, and
finds the end of the image from the address of the external data area
in the first bytes of the BDS-C header. The code above can the
be assembled in the debugger, using a "load hl direct" instead
of "ld hl, image100", and the 10 bytes moved with the debugger's
Move command.

This approach should run on any Z-System, including Apples with
"non-readable" high memories.  The C code should check the z3env value
for non-zero before using it, for the cases in which the code runs on
a non-ZCPR 3.3 or 3.4 system.  In fact, this test should really also
fail if the patch itself has not been made to the linked BDS-C file.
(That may be a good reason to choose a free NUL word inside the BDS-C
library for the xxxx address).  And the startup code should be
extended to include a Z-80 test.

When you have a smooth approach, please post an application note "for
the rest of us"!

Marc Wilson suggested the approach of scanning high memory for the
string 'Z3ENV'.  This technique, necessary for pre-ZCPR version 3.3
systems, needs to be made rigorous.  After finding a match, the
routine must check that the "self-reference" address in the z3env
structure does, in fact, agree with the address at which the match has
been found, and, if not, continue searching.  High memory may contain
several Z3ENV strings -- a named directory, or the host disk buffer.

Have my eyes been deceiving me?

Everyone who owns a [legal] copy of BDS C knows that you get the source to
"C.CCC", which is the run-time header that gets prepended to all .COM
programs.  The solution is to simply take Bridger's code (jmp 10bh ! db
'ZENV3',1 ! dw 0) and put it at the head of the source to C.CCC (sorry I
can't do this for you, as I'm at the office and not at home - GNUUCP doesn't
work on my system yet) and use the ZCPR3-compatible C.CCC file with your
programs that know to check for the signature bytes at 103h.

Subject: Fate of Turbo Modula 2 ?

    I was wondering if anyone on USENET knows anything about the fate of 
Echelon and/or the Turbo Modula 2 compiler they used to sell.  I own a 
copy of the compiler for my SB180 (purchased through MicroMint), and it 
seems I have another orphan.

    The last time I talked to Borland (who apparently wrote the compiler 
originally) they claimed that Echelon now owns exclusive rights to the 
compiler.  It seems that Echelon moved a while ago - I wrote to their 
supposed 'new address', but received no reply.  I then find from the 
most recent N.A.O.G. newsletter that Echelon has 'closed permanently due 
to financial reasons, and ... rights to commercial software (EXCLUDING 
Turbo Modula 2) have been acquired by Alpha Systems'.

    Does anyone know who 'owns' the rights to Turbo Modula 2 ???  And, 
is it possible to get any information about bug fixes/updates ???  Also, 
I'd like to find documentation on the additional two BIOS calls in the 
new BIOS version (3.2, ZRDOS version 1.7) that came packaged with the 
compiler.  It seems the new calls are there for allocating/releasing 
unused chunks of the RAM disk, but I can't confirm this.  Any ideas?  
Please MAIL replies - I'll summarize and post if enough interest is 
expressed, but I think this is a low interest topic!
