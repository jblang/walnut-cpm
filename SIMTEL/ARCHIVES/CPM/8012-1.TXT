Subject: up/down loading programs

At FJW's request I have placed 3 files in the CPM directory:
	CPM;DOWN   LOAD  - a lisp program for simple down-loading
	CPM;UP     LOAD  - a lisp program for simple up-loading
        CPM;UPDOWN DOC   - documentation on using the programs
These have not been tested at non-ITS sites - if you can get them
to work somewhere else, you should probably let people know (they are
meant to be run as LISP init files).  Please send any comments directly
to me as I am not on this list.

Re:   New SDZ hex file


This [MC:CPM;SD HEX] is SD.HEX as of 12/2/80.  This file replaces
earlier versions, which had a problem in the print routine which
caused it to print garbage from memory after the last file name was
printed.  When loaded, the COM file CRC = 87 6C.  See SD.ASM
[MC:CPM;SD ASM] as of 12/2/80 for details on assembly options,
including a narrower display for those with 64 character screens.  SD
is compatible with CP/M 1.4, 2.x and MP/M.  Under CP/M 2.x or MP/M, it
will show SYS files if the following command is used SD *.* S .

Re:   New developments at Northstar

Northstar is going to offer CP/M directly.  Apparently they are
expanding their support for CP/M to the point where it makes more
sense to offer it direct instead of referring sales to Lifeboat.
   Northstar will soon be offering a new memory board that has some
sort of memory-mangement built into it so that the Z80 processor can
address over 300k of ram WITHOUT BANK SWITCHING!  The process is said
to be transparent to the user, making the system look as if it had
over 300k of RAM!
--------------------

The N* CP/M will retail for $230 and include support for their hard
disk.  The hard disk version from Lifeboat is $250.  My dealer has
placed an order for it and I will be receiving that copy to evaluate.
I'll have a report for you soon after I get it.

If we can combine that memory management board and, say, Godbout's
recently announced 128K RAM board, maybe we can seriously consider
offloading some of our medium sized FORTRAN programs into dedicated
single-user micros...

--Frank

P.S. In a slightly related topic for N* hardware hackers who have the
older series processor board made prior to about April this year: I
have the phantom line modification instructions available for anyone
who wants to try it.  N* claims it shouldn't, but several local users
have tried it here and claim it works.  If there is enough interest, I
will key it in and pass it along to try at your own risk...

Reading MC:CPM;DSKCMP DOC, I see that someone [all the names were deleted] has
a CP/M 2.2 CBIOS for the Versafloppy II, as well as a bootloader.  I would kill
to obtain these [well, almost].  I.e., I have a Versafloppy II and rather dislike
SDOS; not only is it inherently slow, but I can't run SPEED under it.  To whoever
has this 2.2: hello, are you out there?  Can anyone give me any hints as to who
it might be?  The message seemed to imply that the software lived on a CBBS.

MC:CPM;CRCK ASM

                         CRCK.ASM version 4.2
                       by Keith Petersen, W8SDZ
                          (revised 10/6/80)
    
              ----> NOTE: MUST BE ASSEMBLED BY MAC <----
    
    CRCK is a program to read any CP/M file and print a
    CYCLIC-REDUNDANCY-CHECK number based on the CCITT standard
    polynominal:

             X^16 + X^15 + X^13 + X^7 + X^4 + X^2 + X + 1
    
    Useful for checking accuracy of file transfers.  More accurate
    than a simple checksum.
    
    Optionally will write an output file to the default drive, listing
    the CRC's of all files checked in a single session.

MC:CPM;MLIST HEX

     MLIST.COM - V3.4 by Keith Petersen, W8SDZ (revised 9/21/80)

    This program lists any size ASCII file by name, reading up to 16k
    of the file into memory at one time, in order to minimize disk
    activity during printout.

    Allows listing of multiple files by using normal CP/M ambiguous
    file names (i.e., MLIST *.ASM).  Before each file is printed, the
    FILENAME.TYPE is displayed.

    Use CTL-S to pause, CTL-C to abort.
    Other characters are ignored.

    This program allows CP/M 1.4 users to have protected ASCII files
    on a remote system, provided that the CCP 'REN' (rename) and
    'TYPE' functions have been changed to some other characters and
    MLIST.COM has been renamed to TYPE.COM.  To protect a file, rename
    it so the last character of the file type is #.  Example -
    MYFILE.AS#

    CP/M 2.x users may use 'TAG.COM' to set the f1' attribute of a
    file, which will prevent this program from listing it.

Subject: Apple and CP/M

I am [slowly] learning what CP/M can and cannot do as I become more familiar
with the Microsoft card.  I have looked around for additional reading matter
on this subject, but don't really find a lot of information.  Rather than ask
a whole bunch of questions, I plan to learn via the "hack" approach.  But
there is one application that I am most anxious to transition over from the
regular Apple software:  a mailing list program that can handle multiple disk
drive data.  Much to my dismay, Lifeboat wasn't much help; apparently not
too much software has been (or is capable of being?) converted to the Apple
CP/M -- problem centers around the unique disk format.

money is not really critical (I wouldn't care to spend enormous
sums on just a terminal because it would be cheaper to get
another micro and make it simulate a terminal) what are good
terminals?
	Good = Typewriter key layout; cursor control keys; gold
key (ie if possible able to set all bits); prefer programmable
keys to aid in text editing; essential that it have ALL ASCII

Subject: More files

Of those who bothered to express an opinion, it was 5:1 in favor of
the long form announcements of new files available in MC:CPM;.

New are:

TY2741 ASM - a modification of an old version of PLINK to emulate an
EBCDIC or Correspondence Code terminal.  Can be modified to work in
reverse by exchanging the CALLs.  Does not support shifted codes, but
can be extended to do that.  Should anyone do that, please submit the
changed version.

The rest below are from W8SDZ (Keith Petersen):

SD ASM and SD HEX - upgraded version of SD (Sorted Directory).

DIRF ASM and DIRF MAC - 

    This file contains routines which can be included in any CP/M
    program to allow listing the directory.  No sorting is done
    because that would require use of more memory above the program.
    These routines use the 80h default buffer for all operations so if
    you have data there be sure to move it before running this
    directory function.  Assume all registers destroyed when calling
    'DIRF'.

		The SIG/M Report (December 1980)
			 by Bruce Ratoff

   The	SIG/M software library seems to have drawn great interest
from  CP/M users both in and out of our  geographical  area.  The
November  SIG/M  meeting at UCTI saw long lines of ACGNJ  members
waiting  to  copy the available diskettes.  Many thanks  to  Jeff
Kashinsky,  whose system got a real workout doing the copying.	A
number	of  individuals  have  volunteered  their  assistance  in
distributing  the library.  Their names and phone  numbers  (some
BBS,  some  voice) appear below.  It is hoped that this  interest
will  continue,  for a group such as SIG/M needs broad support in
order to succeed.

   One	regrettable mishap has occurred in compiling the  library
disks.	Diskette number 4,  a collection of CP/M  utilities,  was
defective at the time of the users' group meeting. Henry Kee, who
compiled  this diskette,  seems to have discovered (the hard way)
an  incompatibility  between Digital Research  PIP  and  Cromemco
CDOS. The end result was several bad files. The diskette has been
re-created and verified, and will be available for copying at the
next  users'  group  meeting.  Those  of  you  who  received  the
defective copies will of course receive a new one at no charge.

			TIP-OF-THE-MONTH

   Changing  the CP/M 2.2 backspace:  As many of you  know,  CP/M
version 2 allows hardcopy-style line editing,  via the rubout and
control-U  keys,  as  well as CRT-style  line  editing,  via  the
backspace  (control-H) and control-X keys.  As supplied,  the CRT
editing keys use a "backspace, forward space, backspace" sequence
to erase characters from the screen.  If your terminal requires a
character code other than control-H (08H) to move the cursor left
one character, you may patch the correct character into locations
1373H and 13ADH of MOVCPM. If you then use the modified MOVCPM to
create a new system, it will use the new backspace character that
you have designated.

   If  you have a CP/M question or know a "trick" that you  would
like to see as a "tip-of-the-month", please contact me via either
the mailing address or telephone number listed above.

All of the software in this directory is in the public domain.  As far
as I know, only MicroTELNET (MTNxx) is copyrighted (by me) and is not
for sale.  I would prefer that you hold off distributing that version
(1.3) off net until the next version becomes available.

This query brings up a point that I would like to take the opportunity
to reinforce:  software submitted for inclusion in the CPM directory
MUST be in the public domain.

How to submit a file: I normally receive each file as a message from
which I trim off the mailer header and trailer, and copy to the CPM
directory.  I then download the file and either assemble or LOAD it to
verify that it is a good copy, and then announce its existence to this
list.  There is nothing to stop you from submitting a file directly
and making your own announcement, provided that you also download the
copy and make the same verification.

It is a spelling system program (which i am not using in composing this

It will prepare a list of all words not in a dictionary, but in a documetn--
etc.  it allows you to update dictionaris easily.   (You can see now why I
bought it.)  It set me back $195--but its worth it in our application.
I use it with Magic Wand.  The author appears to be a wordstar user--and itws
control structure is modelled after wordstar.  


A question:  Is anyone out there familiar with Pascal/M from a supplier

Subject: What is MTN

MTN 1.3 is a modem program written for the Z80 and designed to run
under CP/M with up and download capabilities and auto-dial modem
control.  It has many dynamically changeable options, such as Modem
(internal DCHayes or PMMI, or external), Dial/Redial/Hangup, Record
ON/OFF, Write to disk, Xmit from disk using wait-for-LF-echo, Flow
control for input (XON/XOFF or none), Binary or Text mode record or
transmittion of files, half or fullduplex, 10 soft keys with up to 31
characters per key, status report of settings and buffer state,
interactive mode to set each mode, and "built-in" help documentation.
There is also a startup customization sequence which will let you
predefine these modes and keys and save that version to run later.

Since I wrote that version and released it for free, Lifeboat came out
with BSTMS for $200, which is very similar, but will run on an
8080/Z80 machine.  Meanwhile, bug reports and feature requests have
been coming in, and a new version of MTN is currently being written
and debugged with old bugs fixed and several new features implemented.

For the rest of the details, read MC:CPM;MTN DOC.

	    Query: does anyone have a program that will cause the
    heads to load although nothing is being read?  This to allow use
    of head cleaning disks.  I suppose this might be specific to the
    controller used?  I have a CompuPro Disk One in two separate
    machines (8085/8088 and z-80).  It's nt simple to get them to
    clean the heads, or is it?

It's surprisingly simple. You can write a simple basic program or just
do it interactively. Look up the controller IO addressses in your manual
and then look up which numbers cause the heads to seek to track 77. You
can then just do OUT xx,yy for the appropriate values of xx and yy. be
careful about hax and decimal! your manual will probably give you the
numbers in HEX or OCTAL! Either convert them yourself or have basic do
it for you.
