I want to write an alternative command processor which uses CCP to
handle command file processing. I need some help to determine where the
$$$.SUB is defined so I know what to structure the file contents. Is it
in the DRI manuals, or in any of the CP/M journals? Word of mouth? Look
at some existing PD programs?

Send suggestions to me and I will batch them for the net if there is
enough interest.

Subject: TYPE20
To: info-cpm@brl

I recently got the version 2 TYPE, and found that it
says it ignores user numbers in the header, which appears
to mean it will not type files in other than user 0, since
it could not find some files I knew to exist in users 1-6.
Is there any Doc file for it? None was available at the time
I got it. I would like to know the differences between all
the versions of TYPE from 15 to 20, and perhaps how to patch
things like user recognition, # of lines to type, tab expansion
on/off, types of file to ignore, etc...

Subject: Unix UMODEM version 3.2 now available
To: Info-Cpm@brl

UMODEM, the Unix "C" version of Ward Christensen's MODEM program
has just been updated to version 3.2 and is now available on MIT-MC

   AR43:CPM;UMODEM 32C     the C source code
   AR43:CPM;UMODEM 32HIS   the history of updates

This program is NOT intended to run under CP/M, is for mainframe
UNIX systems.  It uses a protocol compatible with MODEM2, MODEM7,
MDM7xx, etc.  There is NO batch mode - only one file can be sent
each time to the program is invoked.  UMODEM does deal with the
differences between UNIX end-of-line (only LF) and CP/M end-of-line
(CRLF) in ASCII files.  Binary files are transferred intact.

Details of this update:

-- UMODEM Version 3.2 Mods by Michael M Rubenstein, 5/26/83

. fixed bug in readbyte.  assumed that int's are ordered
  from low significance to high

. added LOGDEFAULT define to allow default logging to be
  off.  compile with -DLOGDEFAULT=0 to set default to no
  no logging.

Subject:  BRL FTP

BRL's *new* FTP server (up on all BRL PDP-11/70s last week) does in
fact do ASCII and IMAGE transfers now.  It's not clear to me that
a binary file from MC would make any sense (36 bit words -vs- 8 bit
bytes), but it should work.  We have only tested BINARY transfers
against other UNIXes, though, so if you have problems, be sure to
drop a line to <action@brl>.

FYI, we are devoting most of our attention to our VAX and HEP UNIX
systems these days.  While you folks are finally growing from 8 to
16 bits, we are gladly fleeing the restrictions of 16 bits and running
to our 32 and 64 bit computers.  (Exit hardware-snob mode).

	Alternately, I am about to configure a dual DSDD Seimens 8" subsystem

Jerry -- here's an idea for your friends at Godbout...

I wish one of the S-100 manufacturers of a 68K cpu board for the S-100
bus (Godbout, Dual, Cromemco, ERG, ...) would package Unix with their
68K board.  I'd love to throw away my Z80 cpu and roll my own Unix
system with the remaining S-100 parts (chassis, memory, peripherals)
rather than junking it and buying into the UnixBox market at $8-20K.

What you'd need would be a relocatable version of the Unix kernel into
which you'd bind your own home-made device drivers and real-time clock;
you'd have to create a file system on your hard disk and install a
customized version of the booter.  This may be beyond the ability of
most S-100 users, but then...  we figured out how to use SYSGEN and
MOVCPM and how to customize our BIOS, didn't we?

Anyone who would even think of comparing UNIX to CP/M is out of their

simple operating system. THAT IS IT.

UNIX(tm), on the other hand is the best development enviroment around. It
was written by hackers for themselves, so it wins.

Because it hasn't been done yet, there are a number of considerations:

1) The 68k isn't the ultimate 16bitter on the market. If you want to
	have >real< unix* (Berkeley unix), then you need to have a good
	virtual memory scheme. For this, if you want to stick with the
	68000 family, you would need to go with a 68010 and a number of
	68451 (memory management) chips - about 16 or so to be useful.
	As you see, this implementation can take up a lot of board space,
	so...

2) Drop the 68k and go with National's 16032. It is more orthogonal in its
	instruction set, and it handles virtual memory in the proper way,
	with >fast< context switching (which happens a lot in multi-user
	operating systems like unix). The chip is also about as fast as
	a vax (according to National's literature, using the prime number
	program that was in (I think) Sept 81 Byte), and the benchmark
	that they used can be optimised for even more speed (so, according
	to my guesses and testing it out on our 68ks at work, it would
	end up being as fast as a vax).

	Long live unix!

There is an S-100 68K Unix machine manufactured by Dual Systems which
has been on the market for a couple of years.  Furthermore, there is
what Microsoft calls an upgraded V7 (Xenix) and it is strongly rumored
that another major microcomputer software house is working on some form
of a Unix port for micros.  Since you specifically mentioned Godbout, I
think it is likely that you'll see a Unix for their 16032; National
Semiconductor is supporting that processor with 4.1bsd.

4.1, which does demand-paging, might be a problem for the slower
Winchesters such as the Morrow disk that Priority One has been selling
for $1295 (I believe the average access time is 195 ms.).  Aside from
paging, vanilla Unix does a lot of swapping and thus it goes to the
disk a lot.  I have used Fortunes and Wicats whose lack of disk speed
is a major annoyance.

I have no doubt that a good BIOS hacker could figure out how to modify
a bootstrap and write device drivers for Unix.  And while working with
the kernel requires a firm educational foundation in operating systems
theory, most of the routines in there were deliberately kept simple,
with complex algorithms being used only when they would result in great
gains.  But, then, there is usually little reason to go poking around
in the kernel, anyway, once Unix has been ported to your specific
machine (how often do you modify the BDOS?), nor do most Unix
installations have the luxury of a source license.

That leaves price as the only major obstacle and I confess to knowing
nothing about what will happen to prices in the future.  Maybe Dr.
Pournelle has some wisdom to add in this area......

(May 9, 1983) of Infoworld, there was an advertisement on page 47 by SemiDisk.
In it, they announce a new 256K semidisk for $995 and also reduce the price
for the 512K semidisk to $1495.  This RAM would be perfect for the emulation of

DUAL does have UNIX (V7) for their 68000 system.  They also have
UNIX System-III for their 68010.  Godbout (and MANY others) feel
that the 68K is "treading water" with this type of application and
that it is better left to CPUs like the 16032 and the iAPX286, which
thay claim that they will supply a "FULL UNIX development package"
for when thay start marketing these boards.

DUAL does offer UNIX on their stuff.  From what I hear of GODBOUT, they
decided the cost of putting UNIX in their system was way too much and
since CP/M-68K came out about that time, decided that would be enough
to support their 68000 board.  They also have some OS written in Forth.
Cromemco has something called "CROMIX" which is a UNIX-lookalike, I
believe.

Let's not start the Nth in a series of "my CPU is better than yours"
contests.  Least of all should tout a manufacturer's literature.  The
limitation of single chip CPU based machines is the design of their
bus.

Has a manufacturer of a "micro-mainframe" come up with a mainframe
equivalent bus, in terms of throughput?

Finally, couldn't a 68010 swap the MMU's segment registers when a
non-existant page gets accessed in a new segment?  Might be a tad
slower but you'd only need one MMU with a few segments.

As you said: "Because it hasn't been done yet..."  Let's not make
assumptions.  Rather, ask the man who owns both and has compared them.

The 68010 can swap out the MMU's segment registers, but with only 32 and 512word
pages, there simply aren't enough of them! You really need piles and piles of that
little mmu to do anything useful. I want to have 6meg virtual addresses...Try that
little bit of arithmetic. You can do it on a 16032.

Because it hasn't been done yet, the 68k s100 unix machines should be killed before
they start growing.

The first (and currently only) micro-mainframe is the 16k.

p.s. if you are still hot for the 68010, take a look at the number
	of clock states for instructions vs the 68000...it'll brighten
	your flames a bit.

Put simply, you know not of what you speak!

You should really take a look at the specs for the 68451 MMU before you
try to tell the rest of us how it doesn't work.  I think I can speak
with a bit more authority since I just finished porting UNIX to my
companies 68000 product which uses two 68451 MMUs.  First of all, the
page size may be any power of two, so the typical process might use
4 or 5 segments.  You can get along easily with only one 68451 - our
company chose to use two in order to reduce swapping of descriptors
in systems with LOTS of main memory.  Running in single-user mode,
you will typically not use more descriptors than will fit on one MMU
unless you have a lot going on in background.

In comparing the 68000 with the National 16032, I think a main
consideration to keep in mind is not the raw power of the CPU.  If
you look at benchmarks comparing the 68000 to a VAX in terms of raw
CPU power, I believe the 68000 running at 8MHz is .8 the power of a
VAX 780.  However, you are not going to see a 68000 UNIX system
outperform a VAX UNIX system.  The bottleneck is the disk!  UNIX is
such a disk-intensive OS and most implementations, including ours,
use winchesters, which are fast compared to floppies, but not
compared to the disks that hang off a VAX.

What started this all off was a query about putting UNIX on an S100
box in what I would assume would be a single-user environment.  
Whether it be a 68000 or a 16032, I think you're going to have more
than enough CPU to keep the average hacker happy in that kind of
environment.

Just to add a little fuel to the fire, I have it on good authority
that we will soon be seeing the Bellmac-32 personal comouter from Ma
Bell (I still don't know which division is which now) and it will of
course be running Unix. Needless to say, if I was able to get that
information, IBM will also be quite aware of it by now and presumably
is feverishly porting Unix over to the PC. I wonder where this will
leave Microsoft?

Subject:  New ZCPR2 Files et al

	I just received the latest issue of the ACG-NJ News, and
Steve Leon's SIG/M column mentions several new ZCPR2 files, including
six upgrades (probably different features various people wanted to see)
and a file which implements ZCPR2 on the Apple.  He states that he has
not tried this Apple installation, but at least it may be a good starting
point.

	Also of general interest is version 1.1 of I/O Capture on the
same disk.  I/O Capture is a program which redirects console output to disk.

	Finally, BISHOW Version 1.1 is there as well.  It displays
files in a bidirectional fashion.  I think Keith announced it on MC earlier,
but I did not catch the version number.

	All of these files are on Volume 116 and can be obtained from SIG/M
at the usual address or via some RBBS systems.  The new ZCPR2 files came
from some Toronto RCPM systems.

Subject:  New ZCPR2 Documentation

        I noted an earlier message from the ARPA Net from someone
who  wanted  to  add some more utilities to the ZCPR2 System.  In
response to this message and other direct requests  for  informa-
tion, I'm starting to write a new document on how to use TEMPLATE
to write utilities which fit into the ZCPR2 System.   By  fitting
into  the system, I am referring to being able to reference named
directories, follow paths, and adapt to different ZCPR2  environs
by  installation via GENINS.  I hope my reply to the earlier mes-
sage did not discourage the writer, particularly since  the  only
pointer I could really give was to look at the source to TEMPLATE
and a couple of utilities to see how it was done.

        Note that this has no impact on the utilities in the  PD.
They will still function as per their design, and they should run
under ZCPR2 as they do under CP/M.

        What I am hoping will come of this is the development  of
a  consistent set of ZCPR2 utilities by people other than myself.
For instance, the utilities in the distribution are consistent in
the following senses:

                1.  they can reference named directories
                        XDIR JEFF:, ERASE MYDIR:*.DOC, etc
                2.  they can accept file lists when it makes sense
                        ERASE f1,f2,f3,f4.*,mydir:f5.*,...
                3.  their command syntax is similar
                        COMMAND <file list> <options> or
                        COMMAND /<options>
                4.  GENINS can install ALL of them for different environs
                5.  they can search along paths when necessary
                        HELP MYHELP looks along a path for MYHELP.HLP
                6.  built-in documentation is available and is invoked
                    in the same way
                        COMMAND // or COMMAND /<invalid option>

        TEMPLATE supports designs such as what  I  am  describing
quite  nicely.  The programmer need only "fill in the blanks" for
the initialization routines, deinit routines, function performed,
banner,  built-in  documentation, etc.  The rest of TEMPLATE does
the work of path searching, named directory  conversion,  command
line processing, etc.  The work performed by the programmer boils
down to writing a function which is passed the FCB for an unambi-
guious file, and the process is already logged into the directory
in which that file resides (if it exists).

        Clearly, TEMPLATE is not an  end-all  to  all  situations
yet,  and  as  I get into the paper, you are likely to see one or
more new versions of TEMPLATE come out before the paper  is  fin-
ished.

1. when transferring files automatically from a mainframe to a given
cp/m system, i take it that one needs a program running on the mainframe
(which is specific to that mainframe) to handle the transmission part
of that job.  Anyone know how to find out what program is needed on the
mainframe?  For example, i want to transfer files from a TOPS-20 to my
CP/M system.  What do i need on the 2060?

Apparently, I also need something on my cp/m system.  Will MODEM7 do?  Can
it be used for ALL mainframe-->CP/M transfers?

2. From a maintenenceof system hardware integrity standpoint, is it
better to keep a system continuously on or to turn it off when you don't need
it.
The system in question had both hard and floppy disks.

Of course, if the time between on-off-on is large (days), it's obvious that
it's better to turn it off and then on.  If it is small (minutes), it's
obvious that it's better to leave it on continuously.  What's the crossover
time?

In-reply-to: Msg of 5 Jun 1983 05:40 EDT from Roger L. Long <BYTE at MIT-MC>

Foo!

I have looked at the specs. I also know how unix works internally. A 512
byte page size is a good size for a virtual memory system. If you make the
page size smaller or larger, you're going to be swapping yourself to
death. If you're not running a virtual memory system, then the problem
of trashing gets worse if you're trying to run (ugh) plain vanilly v7.

If Motorola had done it right with the 68451, they would have put in lots
more pointers, or had just a pointer or two into main memory (albiet slower,
but it provides for much faster context switching.

Unix is a multi-tasking system by definition, and on any systems that have
a number of services availiable (networking, multi-users, watchdogging), you
may have thrashing problems if you don't have moby amounts of memory. You
also need to context-switching from process to process. If it isn't fast
enough, then you get thrashing...

I have at work a little baby 68k system with v7, and there simply isn't 
enough processing power to keep >me< happy. There are three problems:
	1) It is running v7 ((ugh) swapping instead of winning paging)
	2) There simply isn't enough memory. We're running 2meg with 8k
	   pages, and that isn't enough to pop into vi (or emacs when I
	   get the tape) from csh - it has to swap out csh in order to
	   load in vi. This is not good for standard development cycles.
	   Maybe you're using ed instead?
	3) The disk i/o on our little 24meg kennedy winnies is too slow - they
	   are one of the causes of my thrashing problems (I run about
	   8 process -- network mailers, and misc daemons). If I had >real<
	   unix (Berkeley unix), then it would cease to be a problem. Bell
	   still hasn't put out a working paging unix yet! Even at Bell,
	   they're running Berkeley on thier vaxen.

In an s100 enviroment, there may be even more bottlenecks than in a multibus
enviroment. 

Not only do we need real virtual memory and a good processor for unix to
be happy, but there will have to be faster i/o devices or the damn thing
is going to be i/o bound rather than computation bound (hell, under gosling
emacs, i can keep a 780 computation bound when i'm doing useful work).

Maybe I'll never be happy with a unix micro.

and my preference for Unix is clear.  

I just wanted you all to see some of the immaturity that we shouldn't

It's quite possible to use a RAM disk as a root (or swap) device for UNIX--
in fact, that's a quite popular way to bootstrap up a kernel before working
disk hardware is available.  Just write a software device driver which
accesses a RAM partition instead of the disk.  Trouble is, UNIX likes LARGE
disks, so unless you have lots of RAM available, it doesn't buy one much.
(I mean, it's OK for bootstrap purposes, but lousy for a production system.)
And the amounts of RAM we're talking about (2-20mb) are still economically
infeasible for most small systems, though this should change soon.

Yes, you could configure a ram disk to be a system device for unix. It
would be even easier to write a driver for that than for a regular disk,
'cause unix doesn't know about track and sectors, just blocks.

The ALTOS serial ports are as follows:

CHIP        DEVICE      CONNECTOR   STATUS  DATA

Z80A-SIO   Console #2       JD        2C     2D
           Console #1       JC        2E     2F

Z80A-DART  Console #3       JB        1C     1D
           Printer          JA        1E     1F

     If you're going to do I/O directly, there are some things to watch
out for, since the ALTOS BIOS is interrupt-driven.  If you just start
doing IN's and OUT's you'll confuse it with extraneous interrupts (and
probably hang the system).

     I recommend using console 2 (JD) as the modem port, if you have a
choice, since the Mostek SIO is more forgiving than the Zilog DART.  One
sequence that works for me is to send the following to the status port
to configure the SIO:

     18H     ; Channel reset. (get rid of any funny conditions)
     01H     ; Select register 1
     04H     ; Disable the SIO interrupts
     04H     ; Select register 4
     44H     ; Set x16 clock, one stop bit, no parity.
     03H     ; Select register 3
     0C1H    ; Receiver enabled always, bytesize = 8 bits, no parity.
     05H     ; Select register 5
     68H     ; Transmitter enabled always, bytesize = 8 bits, no parity.

     I put all this junk in a file called SETMODEM.COM that I run once to
initialize things after power up.

    Following this, an IN from the status port will have bit 2 (04H) on
if the SIO is ready to send a character, and bit 0 (01H) ON if a
character is ready for the CPU to read.

    If you ever need to give the SIO channel back to the BIOS, send the
status port the sequence:

    18H    ; Channel reset
    01H    ; Select register 1
    1FH    ; Interrupt on received characters, parity does not affect
           ; vector, status does affect vector, transmission interrupt
           ; enable, external/status interrupt enable.

and then hope for the best.  It usually works for me, but I don't do it
very often.

Hope this helps

I'm relatively new at this game, but I have been using ZSID
which (as far as I can tell) is the Z80 version of SID (which I
don't have.)  The commands are very much like DDT, except that
A and L will process Zilog mnemonics.  What I would like to get
is a package that disassembles to/from disk and sets up EQUates
on output, so that the file can be read back into M80 or some
other Z-80 assembler.  I'm fortunate to be running a LOBO
MAX-80, since I can use both CP/M and LDOS (an operating system
for the [gasp!!] TRS-80.)  What I have been doing so far is
transferring CP/M .com files over to LDOS and then using the
Misosys DISASM3 disassembler.  After I get an ASM file fixed to
my satisfaction, I transferr it back over to the CP/M side.  A
bit complicated, but it does work.  If you hear of any programs
that do what I am looking for, please drop me a message.

My friend deals closely with Zenoth and keeps hearing that CP/M-86
release for the Z-100 is "imminent" - he has been hearing so for
months, so take it for what its worth. I do not doubt that it will be
available within the not too distant future.

Zenith sees to have no plans to implement any MP/M or concurrent
system. Gifford Engineering (G&G) has just received a Z-100 for
evaluation - they conceivably could have the goal of bringing up
MP/M-816 and/or CCP/M-816 on the beast. If you are really gung-ho on
this, I suggest you give them a call or send them a letter asking for
it. They are one of the few service-oriented outfits left in the cold
cruel world of micros and I think the world of them. They listen to
what their customers have to say.

Most of us will accept silicon, but Gail Zacharias's request to
switch from buss to bus is a request of a different magnitude.
As we sit at our terminals grinding out documentation, it is very
theraputic to slip in a buss in place of a bus. Actually, I find that
being consistent in always spelling something wrong will inhibit most
potential criticism. Now that Gail has blown the bus-buss outlet for
supressed urges another will have to be found. Perhaps osculation in

	Well, Andy, the page size on your beloved Vax is 1024.

I beg to differ. On pages 16 and 17 of the VAX Architecture Handbook, it
states:
	``Virtual address space is diveded into @b(pages), where a page
	  represents 512 bytes of contiguously addressed memory. The first
	  page begins at byte 0 and continues to byte 511. The next page
	  begins at byte 512 and continues to byte 1023, and so forth.''

.....on page 9 of the same book, it defines a byte as 8 bits. Sorry, Goldfarb.

You're probably confused because Bill Joy et al decided to use 1k file
system blocks (so of course, Berkeley unix swaps at this size, but the
VAX hardware itself thinks in 512byte pages.).

Subject: 68000 Unix systems

It is hard for me to believe that a 68000 cannot run Unix, because I
have used one that does.  A Callan Unistar-100 with half a meg performs
pretty well with one user.  It is definitely I/O bound, but still a nice
system.  It performs remarkably better than a VAX-11/780 at two in the
afternoon!

The Unistar runs Microsoft's V7 port, "with Berkeley enhancements".
Therefore, it performs swapping, not paging.  It uses the SUN board, so
I think that it has its own bipolar MMU.  As long as there is enough
memory to prevent paging, it performs pretty well.  256K is not enough to
load vi without swapping out csh, but 512K lets compiles and edits take
place in parallel.  A multi-user machine should definitely have even more
memory, although I think that you should probably just get more machines.
More memory would always be a good idea, since the lack of virtual memory
puts a hard limit on the size of programs.

The Unistar has 5 inch winchesters, which are usually not fast.  However, it
only seems to be three or four times slower than an unloaded VAX when doing
C compiles.  I haven't timed it real carefully, so perhaps it is even slower.
However, as I said, a Unistar-100 is definitely faster than a VAX at two in
the afternoon, with a few EMACS, a troff, and a large LISP program in progress.
On a personal computer, the speed of the computer is related only to your
demands on it, not your neighbors.

A Unistar-100 with 10 or 20 Meg disk and 512K is in the $10,000 range.
It probably won't run large LISP program until it has virtual memory, but
it will do most Unix jobs quite nicely.

To: RIZZI@usc-isib

Yes, I believe it would be possible to write a RAM disk driver for
UNIX, but I think that if you are going to put a substantial
amount of memory into a system for such a purpose, it could be better
utilized by other means.

For instance, certain mods have been made to various UNIX systems to
leave sharable code in memory once you are finished using it until
such time as you want to use the code again, or you need the memory
for something else.  Having a large amount of main memory would
mean less chance of such things having to be loaded from disk again,
so in a sense, you are obtaining the same benifits of having a RAM
disk by other means.

Also, UNIX manages a large buffer pool, and reuses its buffers with
a LRU algorithm, I believe.  If you have lots of memory, increasing
this buffer pool should automatically give you the effect of having a
RAM disk, as if the disk block that UNIX needs is already in a buffer,
no physical I/O operation will be requested of the disk driver.

I have been quite satisfied with DISINTEL, a disassembler I purchased
from Lifeboat for about $65 a few years ago.  This program reads a .COM
file and produces the .ASM equivalent (with an optional XREF) using
Intel mnemonics with the TDL extensions for the Z80.  (There is another
version called DISILOG for the Zilog mnemonics.)  It carries out a flow
analysis of the code to determine entry points, subroutines, data references,
and external references, and it generates only the above labels with an
indicative prefix character (e.g. X0005 for an external call on the BDOS).
The program asks numerous questions to determine the offset and length
of the disassembly segment in the .COM file, the PC value at entry,
regions of DB and DW tables, generation of the cross reference, etc.

My only complaints about DISINTEL would be that the command dialogue
does not always use the BDOS read-line function, so that you cannot
batch all of the data into a submit file using XSUB (re-entering twenty
lines of table addresses in hex can be tedious); it is not too
convenient to use for interactive (detective-style) disassembly; it
does not allow disassembly of regions as character strings (requiring
instead that the region be disassembled as DB's); and the manual shouts
at you entirely in UPPERCASE.

        A bug has been detected useing the Insert command. It can result
in the loss of data record if a carriage return is issued at the wrong
time. (Tate knows about it but no solution yet.) So they are recommending
that you do not use INSERT and INSERT BEFORE. 
        Case in point, C.J.Thompson wrote that if you have issued the Insert 
command, after indexing to some intermediate record in your database,
you are presented with the standard data input screen with the cursor in
the first position of the first field.
        If you enter data at this point, everything seems to work as
advertised. But if you should happen to enter a carriage return (thinking
perhaps, to move the cursor to the second field), you are dumped out of
the Insert mode only to find that the record count in your database has
been incremented by one.  Further insp`,W{on reveals, however, that the
'plus one' count is the result of two events; (1) the record following
the intended insertion point has been triplicated, and (2) the next
record has been deleted. And evidently, not by a "*" but 'all gone'.

        I was going to update a members information in my Name/Address
database when I accidently entered a CONTROL CHARACTER UNKNOW into my
file and it got written to the DataBase. I had 272 records in my DBF file
but after that goof I got a OUT OF RANGE error after 24 records. After
two lousy hours of research and trial/error I finally got it back on track.
In my efforts, I learned a lot about things I really have no need for but
what can I say, maybe some day.  Anyhow, nothing worked, either in the
DBF or NDX until  (1) I added a new record (2) erased the NDX and then
(3) INDEX again. It seems to be O.K. now. The error evidently changed the
total record stored somewhere (I never found out where) but the 272 records
was always in the DBF file.

----
Local hint (from Dave)-- When you use GET and the 1st field is a numeric
        it'll probably crash, if character it's O.K. (at least for him it
        did)
Safety hint-- After working on your DBF file and you want to use PACK.
        Be sure to exit first ,to force a write to disk, then re-enter
        to do your PACK operation. Some locals have lost their data
        otherwise, but why hasn't been pin-pointed yet.

FINI for now

We use dBase rather intensively at my place of employment and additional
bugs have been noted, as follows:

a) If the CASE statements are nested to more than two levels the
program will crash.

b) If two files are open at the same time, a PRIMARY and a SECONDARY,
SET LINKAGE ON command will crash the program and cause the infamous
"BDOS Error on Drive xx" error message, with the xx being a non-
existant drive.

These two bugs occurred consistantly on both the eight-bit and
sixteen-bit (CP/M86) versions of dBase II.

I would be interested in hearing of fixes or new releases of dBase II
that would take care of these bugs.

Subject: File Open BDOS patch
To: info-cpm@brl.arpa

I have an idea to create a patch to the BDOS file open function
which would allow searching a search list consisting of Disk,,User# elements.
The purpose of this patch would be to allow more than just .COM files
to live on a sys: type area, but also the MINCE swap file, FORTRAN compiler
error message file, BDS-C's various files etc. Would this be of use to
anybody else? Does anybody know of any pitfalls? Has this already been
done? 

I realize that this will require some code space in the CBIOS area to
have enough room to accomodate the changes. I pretty much have the
flowchart--what-have-you--developed but any info that someone would
like to pass along would be appreciated.  I believe that this would
not cause any trouble with ZCPRx but I am not sure.

  There is indeed a gotcha: as you read (or write) a file opened in
this manner, eventually you're gonna come to the end of extent #0.
The BDOS automatically closes that extent and opens the next.  The
problem is that the 2nd extent will be opened in the CURRENT user
area; and will not be found (since the file was opened in some
other user area along the search path).  Hence, premature EOF.
  Two additional steps would have to be taken to get around this:

	1) When the file is opened, the user # of the file would have
	   to be recorded somewhere; either in a table (not very desirable
	   since a fixed-size table implies a limit to the number of open
	   files -- although the table could be made arbitrarily large)
	   or in the fcb itself (much better insofar as # of open files
	   is concerned, but WHERE in the FCB do you store the user #?
	   Look at the S1 byte; I'm pretty sure it's unused).

	2) The read-sequential, read-random, write-sequential and
	   write-random system calls must be intercepted to allow the
	   setup of the user # the REAL system calls get control; the
	   intercept routines must get control back immediately after the
	   real routines execute, in order to restore the user #.

Note that there is no problem with default drives, since the FCB has
a DR field to record the drive number, and this may be changed
easily.

Both TurboDOS and MP/MII allow opens to default to user #0 if a file
is not found in the current user area; rather than recording the user #,
both set an attribute bit in the in-memory FCB to flag the fact that the
file was opened under user 0 (this technique limits you to only one
public user area, however).

Finally, this change will not impact ZCPR or ZCPR2 at all; it will
think it has found its file in the current user area, and will not
continue the search.  (this will not be true of any programs that do
functions 17/18 searchfirst/next before opening the file, since you
can't apply this mod to them -- such programs simply won't find their
files).

I would like to get a copy if the mod if you proceed with this;
it's something I've thought about doing for some time, and never
had the time.		--Ron Fowler

 Thanks to all who responded. I thought a little about the "crossing
the extent boundry" problem but the input I got confirmed the areas
I must look at. I have much of the patch coded and need a little more
work on it. I will release it to the net when/if I get it done and

From: fylstra.tsca@sri-unix
Received: from SRI-Tsca.micom by SRI-TSC.micom with rs232; 10 Jun 83 15:52-PDT

I was aware of the fact that Dual sold an S-100-based Unix system,
but not much more than that.  A few days ago I telephoned them
and asked for details.  They told me that the minimum system that
would include Unix is the 83/20 for $16,666.  Here is a description:

	- 68K cpu running at 10 MHz with memory mgt
	- 512K of dynamic RAM with parity
	- 4-port serial I/O with DMA
	- system clock board
	- EPROM board containing booter
	- 20-slot IEEE 696/S-100 backplane, chassis, and power supply
	- Winchester disk controller
	- floppy disk controller
	- 20 MB 8" hard disk (Fujitsu)
	- 1 MB 8" DSDD floppy disk (NEC)
	- Unix V7 (port by UniSoft); Unix III forthcoming

They also offer the usual lineup of 80 MB disks, 9-track magtape,
microINGRES (tm) data base mgt system, Viewcomp spreadsheet, R/M Cobol,
etc.

Naturally, this is not quite what I had in mind.  I want to preserve
my investment in my S-100 chassis, power supply, memory, and peripherals.
I'd like to buy just the 68K (or 16032) cpu with the Unix license and
roll my own device drivers.

Subject: T/MAKER III review
Article-I.D.: ucbvax.246

 
		T/MAKER III -- first impressions


       T/MAKER III consists of a number of programs (overlays)
and represents a sort of integrated business package, covering
list processing, graphics, data transfer and file management
in addition to word processing and electronic spreadsheet functions.
It is reasonably well documented (see below) and relatively
easy to use, partly thanks to the excellent 'Quick Refence
Booklet' that is included. All parts of the system are integrated
together and the editor is used for all data entry functions,
even to the spreadsheet. The spreadsheet works somewhat different
from most other similar programs in that respect, and no calculations
are done until a COMPUTE command is given at the main command
level. In my opinion it is not very useful for the typical
"what if" application, but will probably do fine for accounting
purposes etc. The editor and text formatter can handle most
types of documents, and although some of the text formatter
commands (for text justification in particular) are very different
from the 'mainstream' text formatter, it works ok. And the
text printing utility is very powerful, making it easy to handle
most types of printers, special characters/types and limited
(low resolution) graphics. However,
the documentation leaves a lot to be desired when it comes
to customization. Not only the printer interface section but also
the section on how to set up and change the various editor keystrokes
are too terse. I haven't spent enough time with the package
yet to be able to give it a fair judgement, but here are my
strongest points against it (some of these are actually bugs):
 
- The default tab settings can't be permanently changed
  (they are 8, 30, 40, 50, ...)
- I do not get a warning if I try to exit the program without
  saving my changes
- Tabs are always expanded.
- Files containing tabs cannot be edited (the line is discarded
  from the first tab)
- I strongly resent the way the destructive backspace works
 (it deletes the character under the cursor and moves the cursor
  one position to the left)
- Files larger than the available memory buffer cannot be edited.
  On this system with 61K TPA, this limit is ~26.5Kbytes.
  While this probably is sufficient for many word processing
  applications, it is useless for programming (the BIOS source
  for this system is 28.5k with embedded tabs).
- Insert mode (in the editor) does not apply to newlines (carriage
  returns). This means that if I want to insert more text into
  the middle of my document I will have to push the "insert Line"
  key to open up a sufficient window in the text to hold the
  additions. It is hard to believe that this limitation was imposed
  intentionally....
- when the program is started, it can optionally take a number
  of commands from the command line. This means that I cannot
  give the command "tmaker myfile", instead I must write "tmaker
  get myfile". I strongly resent this.
 
Documentation

	-> T/MAKER III Reference Manual, 300 pages (plastic) spiral bound.
	This manual is huge, not only because it contains a lot of
	information, but also because it have been printed on an Epson
	MX80 printer. In addition to describing the
	various tasks T/MAKER can take care of, it starts off with a
	tutorial which is quite useful. It also contains a section on
	how to customize the software to run in a particular hardware
	environment. The index (in the front of the manual) is useful
	but too brief.

	-> T/MAKER III Quick Reference Guide, 30 pages spiral bound.
	A nice booklet full of very useful information. It is nicely
	typeset and printed in full color on real thick paper, so it
	should last for a while even with extensive use.

Conclusion:
  T/MAKER III is a well documented, relatively bug-free, easy to use and
well integrated "business package", useful for limited text processing,
accounting and list processing as well as (very) limited low resolution
business graphics. The fact that data is easily passed between the
various parts of the package makes it even easier to use. Mailing lists
are easily handled as are "generalized letters" with macro fields
to be filled in from a data file a printing time.
  I will use T/MAKER for document editing and formatting and possibly
the spreadsheet for checkbook balancing. I will certainly stick to
VEDIT for program editing.

Hi there --

	I am not sure if this subject has come up in the past,
if it has, sorry for the replication.  I have two systems, an
Apple II+ and a DEC Rainbow 100 PC.  Both machines are running
CP/M.  I have some software running on the Apple which I wish to
put on the Rainbow.  The machines are not entirely compatible,
and there's the rub.  Is there some simple way to transfer files
between machines.  Any help will be greatly appreciated.

	Thank you.

Some time ago you asked about a typing tutor program.  If you haven't
found one yet take a look at TYPTUTOR.  It is sold at HEATH stores
and really neat.  You do need an H19, Z19 or Z89 however, since the
program makes extensive use of the Heath graphic character set.

Even if you don't need it or can't use it on your terminal, its
worth a look anyway- just for the clever use of graphic characters.

There are thirty or so lessons plus a demo.  In the lessons, characters
are typed by the program near the top of the screen.  You try to type
them and what you type shows up lower on the screen, with errors in
inverse video.

The most impressive part is the demo program.  It draws a very good
representation of the keyboard on the lower two-thirds of the screen.
Letters of the alphabet are typed by the program, near the top of the
screen and, IN CADENCE, the corresponding keys on the keyboard
picture are highlighted.

In the lessons, when a new set of letters are introduced, the
keyboard picture is drawn with superimposed hands, showing which
fingers are to be used for each letter of the set.

Its definitely worth a look.

It should be noted that the Berkeley paging algorithm, (global demand paging),
is >20 years out of date.  It has been known since the early sixties
that paging a process against itself between low and high water marks
(and swapping against other processes)
is much more efficient than global demand paging.

   I have no doubt that a good BIOS hacker could figure out how to modify
   a bootstrap and write device drivers for Unix.  And while working with
   the kernel requires a firm educational foundation in operating systems
   theory, most of the routines in there were deliberately kept simple,

Well, I really doubt it. It takes a helluva cp/m hacker to write
disk device driver for unix. Not only will he have to now how to
deal with the device itself (which he probably knows, being a
BIOS hacker), but he will have to know a lot about the 
internals of Unix since the drivers take care of a lot of buffer
handling. If the system source is not readily available, this may
make the task impossible since the buffer management may change from 
one implementation to the next thus invalidating any existing 
documentation. But if a sample driver is supplied with the system,
yes, it could probably be done by a "good BIOS hacker".

In writing controller software for a 1791 controller I used the read entire
track (including gaps and format information) to make sure that I wrote the
format code correctly.  Using 8 1K byte sectors per track I noticed that there
was enough space left after the last sector for another one.  This gives an
additional 144K bytes (77 tracks*2 sides*1024 bytes).  I tried it and it works
fine, the only change needed besides the format module was to change the
diskdef macro in my bios to say '1,72' sectors rather than '1,64'.

Why do the comercialy available 1K sector implementations use 8 sectors/track?

Use any version of Ward Christensen's MODEM program (MODEM7xx, MDM7xx,
MODEM2xx) and connect the two machines together using RS-232 serial
port.  Set the ports for 8 data bits, one stop bit and no parity.
Reverse the connections on pins 2 and 3 on ONE END of the cable
connecting the two machines.  Make sure the baud rate is identical on
both.  Test path using the "T"(terminal) mode on each MODEM program
before trying transfers.  You should be able to type on one machine
and see it on the other.  Set baud rate for highest that will support
error-free transfers (I use 4800 baud).  Initially start at 1200 (or
even 300) baud to debug the connections.  If you use MDM7xx, you'll be
able to use the "B"(batch) mode which allows multiple transfers with
commands specifying ambiguous names (like SB B:*.*).

To: INFO-CPM@mit-mc

I thought this might be of interest to anyone who wishes for some way
to read/write disks in as many CP/M disk formats as possible for the
least amount of money...Rick Rump, the author and distributor of "MicroShell",
has completed a hardware/software combination product that allows 5 1/4"
disks to be read and written in MANY different formats. The package will be
available in both S-100 plug-in and standalone configurations. The one I've
just ordered includes a controller, drive, cables and software for automatical-
ly making the drive act like any one of the soft-sectored formats, including
Osborne, KayPro, Xerox, TeleVideo, SuperBrain, etc. 
Such a device will be invaluable to me for making it possible to stuff
disks in all these formats without having to buy the machines they will be
used on. I suspect I am not alone in needing this ability! Exact prices
have not been finalized yet, but the S-100 plug-in version should be under
$1400 complete. For more info, contact:

Subject:  New SYSIO

AR84:CPM contains a new version of  SYSIO  (my  redirectable  I/O
package  under  ZCPR2).   This file, called SYSIO 2ASM, is source
for a redirectable I/O package which gives the  user  seven  con-
soles  and five printers under ZCPR2.  It gives the general ZCPR2
user a fairly good example of how to implement a redirectable I/O
package  under ZCPR2 so that DEVICE, IOLOADER, and RECORD can in-
teract with it.

This package defines the following physical devices:

        Consoles --
                TTY     Printing Terminal
                CRT     CRT Display
                CRTMOD  CRT and Modem in Parallel
                CRTREM  CRT Input and CRT/Remote Computer Output
                CRTMOD2 CRT Input and CRT/Modem Output
                CRTTY   CRT Input and CRT/TTY Output
                CRTNEC  CRT Input and CRT/NEC Spinwriter Output
        Readers and Punches --
                MODEM   Modem
                CLOCK   DC Hayes Chronograph
        List Devices --
                TTY     Printing Terminal
                CRT     CRT Display
                NEC     NEC Spinwriter Output
                MODEM   Modem
                REMOTE  Remote Computer

In interacting with DEVICE, the user need no longer concern  him-
self  with  the  arbitrary  physical device names associated with
STAT.  DEVICE allows the user to find out the names of the physi-
cal  devices  he has available and to assign them mnemonically as
he wishes.  For instance, the following commands are valid:

        DEVICE Display All
                -- Display the names of all physical devices
        DEVICE Console=CRT,List=NEC
                -- Assigns the CRT to the console and the NEC
                        Spinwriter to the List Device
        DEVICE //
                -- Displays built-in documentation

DEVICE is also documented in the ZCPR2 literature.

Enjoy!

        Rick

P.S.  Ron Fowler's MLOAD is useful in creating SYSIO.IO.

I was astounded when I read the price you quoted.  $1400 ???  You can
buy a Kaypro-II for the newly-reduced price of $1595 and get a newly-
announced program that lets the Kaypro-II read and write all those
5-1/4" formats you mentioned.  If I needed that ability, I'd certainly
want to consider the Kaypro-II approach rather than the "Disk Maker"
because I'd have a whole computer rather than a drive and controller
to add to my present system.  I hope Rick Rump will consider this
before he sets his final price on the "Disk Maker".  My personal
opinion is that it shouldn't sell for more than $700.

The problem with file transfer between a DEC Rainbow and another CP/M
system is that the Z80 side of the Rainbow doesn't have any access to the
status of the communications port, so it can't run any of the versions of
MODEM or MDM.  I have hacked together a version of YAM on the 8088 side that
works to/fro most of the MODEM/MDM/YAM variations at up to 9600 baud.  This is
public domain software, thanks to Chuck Forsberg; was published here a few
months ago; and I will be happy to down-load it to a RBBS or can make other
arrangements on request. The Rainbow is just an expensive desk ornament
without YAM.

Subject: File transfer between machines.
To: info-cpm@mit-mc.ARPA

I was recently faced with transferring between an
SD system and an Eagle II. The SD had MODEM7 running, and had
an 8-inch floppy, but the Eagle had only 5-inch, with no
documentation on the format.
fortunately, both had serial ports, which were configured into
CP/M as RDR: and PUN:
So, we wired the two ports together, and used PIP to transfer
source from one machine to the other. On one, I PIP'd to
the PUN:, and on the other I PIP'd from the RDR: into a file.
We had to do it slow, because there was no error-checking,
but we got the source for MODEM7 across.
At that point we realized we did not have a macro assembler on
the Eagle. The serial port driver strips off the high-order
bit, so we could not transfer the assembler, plus it is somewhat
complex to trust to a trasnfer without error-checking.
So, we modified it in the SD to match the Eagle hardware,
assembled it, and PIP'd the hex over to the Eagle.
There is an option on PIP to check for valid Intel hex
format. It seems to discard all improper records without
any message. But comparing file lengths told us the
transfer went OK.
Anyway, we now had MODEM7 for the Eagle, and started
using that for subsequent transfers.

I would also suggest a local Apple, DEC, or CP/M user group
for the possibility of MODEM7 already ported to the right
format.

Every time I put the stuff in there another version comes out, so

Hi,

  Talked to the OS folks at Zenith yesterday.  They said that ZDOS (MS-DOS
for the Z-100) should handle double-density single-sided 8-inch disks.
BUT, they provide a FORMAT program for M-DOS that defaults to double-density
for 2-sided and single-density for 1-sided.  It can't be forced, and they 
won't provide the source.

  Question:  Does anybody out there know how to format an 8-inch Z-DOS disk
for single-sided, double density?  HELP, I don't really want to sell off
my drives, they still work very well!

I've had several requests for information on which files are new
in MODEM902.LBR.  They have already downloaded the entire MODEM901.LBR
and see little reason to do the same with 902 if only a few of the
files are different.

The concept of assembly-time linking of the various modules was
supposed to be desirable for two reasons: first, to make them
easier to edit; second, so that only those files which were
ACTUALLY CHANGED would have to be downloaded by the users.

Perhaps it would be best to make up a MODEM902.UPD (update) file
which tells which files are the same and which have been changed.
What do you think?

	The YAM package is the best bet for public domain file transfer
on the Rainbow.  However, I have recently gotten ahold of a new
improved version of Ascom that really does work on the Rainbow in all
modes of operation.  It is a commercial package, but will speak
Christensen protocol (among others).  Make sure you request and get
the Rainbow config file with it, or expect to do some assembly
language programming.  A nice package, and relatively easily customized.

To me, and I suspect, to many other tinkerers, having source is more

Re:   Rainbow to anything else File-transfer

We currently have KERMIT running for RAINBOW - and could have MODEM
running aside from my laziness - what I don't need - I don't spend
time with.  The "recipe" is easy: Use the I/O byte to get to RDR/PNCH
from the Z80 and use "straight" BIOS-calls (which MODEM does anyhow).
Our "generic" KERMIT runs on DEC's VT180 and on DEC's RAINBOW with NO
changes (and with a two-line change in the I/O byte assignment on
DEC's DECMATE II with the CP/M option).  Yes, one looses some "speed"
on RAINBOW being on the "wrong" side for character-transfer ==>
terminal emulation works clean up to 1800 baud.  Protocol transfers
run nicely up to 4800 Baud.

Hello,
When running Heath/Zenith CP/M with the Z37-89 DD controller
and Tandon TM-100-4 drives, I often get BDOS SELECT errors.
Notice that this Tandon drive was brought from an outside
dealer NOT from Heath [Heath jacks up the price on outside
things they sell in their stores]. The drive is rated for 3ms
seek - those Bdos error SELECT happen during warm boot @ 6ms
When I increased the speed to 12 ms step, the errors went away
as well as all those soft errors I didnt know about. (see
SECERR counter in Heath BIOS listing - they give you # of
soft errors and retries)  Does any-one know what is wrong??
Is it because I used a non-Heath drive or what?
Thank you very much,

Subject: MODEM 9.03
To: INFO-CPM@brl


	A new version of MODEM9 is now available on MIT-MC as
CPM;MODEM 903ASM. The comments from the reviser, Tony Camas,
are as follows:

06/15/83  Revised program as follows:
(MODEM903)
	1. Fixed bug in INBUFF routine which jumped to START (of program)
	   instead of ISTART (beginning of read line code) on a ^U,
	2. Added save of register A (& PSW) to interrupt handler for
	   VT180/ROBIN version (in 8251SYS.ASM),
	3. Corrected Kaypro/Xerox clear to end of screen sequence in
	   SIOSYS.ASM per P. L. Kelley.
	4. Made extensive changes to TERM.ASM to better support Robin
	   system.  Basically, this involved setting up a private routine
	   for handling console interrupts when in MODEM terminal mode so
	   as to avoid funny processing of ^S, ^Q, and VT100 arrow keys
	   done by DEC's CBIOS.
	5. Added wait for modem output character ready to main loop of
	   terminal mode.  This was never there, presumably due to the
	   assumption that no one can type that fast.  Unfortunately, this
	   was a problem in (at least) the Robin configuration, since the
	   pressing of certain keys generates escape sequences faster than
	   the output baud rate.
	6. Added definitions of version number and revision date values to
	   MODEM9xx.ASM...these are now referenced in the signon message
	   in START.ASM.  This eliminates the necessity of editing START.ASM
	   when changing version numbers.  Also added brief instructions to
	   MODEM9xx.ASM as to what to do when you want to change versions.
	7. Added strongly-worded warning to START.ASM about not setting
	   certain combinations of file transfer options.  Mostly I did
	   this because it tripped me up for a good four or five hours when
	   I tried to set XOFF testing and Echo Waiting modes together as
	   defaults.
	8. Comment:  Someone who feels energetic should add code to one or
	   more of the xxxSYS modules to handle the BREAK key (if the
	   appropriate system has one) in terminal mode.  One of the remote
	   machines I frequent uses BREAK like a ^C, and when I hit break
	   in MODEM, the 8251 for my console line gets framing errors and
           produces one or more funny input data values (which are then
	   dutifully sent off to the remote system).  It's an annoying
	   problem, but I'm too lazy at the moment to try and tackle it
	   myself.
							A. G. Camas


	An update file (MODEM9xx.UPD) also been added which
contains the names of the files which have been changed so that
users need extract only those files from the library.

	Tony has done some violence to the philosophy of putting
system dependent routines only in the SYS files; the TERM file
now contains ROBIN specific conditional assembly code. In the
next version either Tony or I will try to return to the
SYS-file-only approach. In any case, Tony's changes are most
useful, particularly for ROBIN owners.

Brian, when you get multiple copies of a single message it's usually
due to a mailer problem.  The originator of the message isn't
responsible and no one else on the mailing list is either.  It's best
to just delete the duplicates and say nothing.  The list administrator
will see the problem and have it fixed, usually right away.  Sometimes
it takes awhile to get those mailer loops fixed, though, and
occasionally as many as 20-80 copies may be received.  None of us
likes to see such things, but it's probably best not to bother the
whole group with complaints about it.  You can complain about Info-Cpm
to INFO-CPM-REQUEST@BRL, or if you can't get through the gateway to
Arpanet, use the address ...duke!unc!brl-bmd!info-cpm-request and it
will be forwarded to BRL.

My advice is to ignore TMS2716's. TI should be shot for using the
same number (2716) for a three-voltage version of the one-voltage
2716.

Both chips are so cheap now that you can afford to throw out your
few TMS2716's and replace them with real 2716's. Then you only have to
program one kind. The H19 allows jumpering for either kind. I don't
know about the H89's processor card, but I'd bet it was the same
way.

(The TI version of the "real" 2716 is called a TMS2516, by the way.)

Good advice, but you have shot the wrong people. The TI (3 voltage)
2716 was a quite correctly numbered compatible follow-on product to
the (3 voltage) 2708 and 2704 series. It was also available well
before the 1-voltage product. It is Intel that ought to be shot for
giving the same family number to a radically different device.

We also have some Tandon drives, which we bought about a year and
a half ago.  They are single drives, in metal cases.  We had no
trouble until a few months ago when the power supply in one drive
failed.  After we had the power supply replaced with a
reconditioned power supply, and probably unrelated to that, I
sysgenned a couple of new system disks and immediately started
getting warm boot errors, on either of two disks, whenever I
exited from a program such as an editor or a modem program, and
also (much worse) whenever I tried to write to disk from within
the program.

I found that if I opened the door of the drive and wiggled or
moved the disk slightly, the disk would reboot without fail.  I
could then write to disk, if I gave the command right away.  I
could also prevent errors by wiggling the disk BEFORE I wrote to
disk or exited from the program.  (This is clearly kludgy, but it
works, and, fortunately, SpellBinder, my usual editor allows me
to restart and capture the text in the buffer.)  After I read
your message, I tried configuring my drives to 12 ms seek time
instead of 6 ms, and I got the warm boot errors just the same.

The owner of the store that sold us the Tandons suggested that
the power supply might be running too hot.  I then realized that
I had sysgenned my new system disks when the drives were just
turned on, and therefore cold.  I have now re-sysgenned after
the system had been running for over an hour, and have had only
one "BDOS error", followed by a "warm boot" error.  So maybe I
have partially conquered the problem.  I don't know how to adjust
the temperture of the power supply.  These single drives do not
have cooling fans.  I can't tell from the catalog whether the
Heath H37 does or not.

I haven't yet looked into the SECERR counter, but I shall.

Subject:  New SYSLIB/ZCPR2 Files

AR84:CPM contains a new set of SYSLIB and ZCPR2 files.  These files
are:

	SYSLIB 27REL
	SDIR, SEPRINT, SEPSTR, SVERSION, and SYSTEST2 (MQC)
	ECHO (COM and MAC)

The S...MQC files are changed/new SYSLIB sources.  SYSLIB 27REL is the
REL file of SYSLIB 2.7.  The new ECHO (for ZCPR2) is using the new
SYSLIB to provide the user with the ability to issue escape sequences
to his terminal from the command line.  Unlike the old ECHO, which
interpreted escape sequences (and any control character) and printed
them in the ^c form, this ECHO performs only limited interpretation
(of TAB primarily) and echoes all other characters in their "exact"
forms.

SYSLIB 2.7 contains a fix to the DIRLOAD routine which corrected a
problem with the DIRF routine.  It also contains two new routines,
namely EPRINT and EPSTR, which perform like their PRINT and PSTR
counterparts (same I/O requirements) except that they perform limited
control character processing.

There will probably be a Z2SYS 4MOD file to following in a day or two.

CRCs check.

Has anyone had any experience with the Aztec C compiler, for the CP/M
operating system. I would like to know how well this C will interact with
the CP/M operating system. In BDS C there are several functions that allow
you to get to the BDOS, BIOS and ports without writting the code in
assembler. Are there similar functions in Aztec C or will I have to write
them. How does Aztec C interface with functions that are written in
assembler, is this very difficult to do.

Hi,

	I have used the AZTEC C compiler for a small amount of work and I am
very impressed. Yes it does have links to the BDOS and BIOS thru function calls
and there is a piece of user submitted (i.e. not written by MANX software) routine
which allows one to write and read from an I/O port. Aztec does allow romable
routines but I have not actually tried this yet. Inline assembly code is allowed
thru the use of #ASM and #ENDASM macros and the calling convention of how to
pass local variables on the stack is defined and an example given. I hope this
is enough information, if not give me a holler.

Aztec C provides an excellent interface to both BIOS/BDOS CP/M calls and
assembly programming.  The following calls are defined (taken from release
1.05 manual):

bdos (bc,de)
int bd,de;
	Calls the bdos with register pair BC set to bc and DE set to de.
	The value returned in HL is the return value.

bios(n,bc,de)
int n,bc,de;
	Calls the n'th entry into the bios with BC set to bc and DE set
	to de.  The returned value is the accumulator contents on return
	from the CP/M BIOS.  N equal to zero is a warm boot.

bioshl(n,bc,de)
int n,bc,de;
	Calls the n'th entry into the bios with BC set to bc and DE set to
	de.  The returned value is the HL register contents on return from
	the CP/M BIOS.  N equal to zero is a warm boot.

CPM(bc,de)
int bc,de;
	Calls the bdos with register pair BC set to bc and DE set to de.
	The value returned in HL is the return value.

-------------------

Aztec C creates intermediate assembly language code.  An intel assembler
(subset of M80) is provided, although it is possible to use M80/L80.  So,
interfacing assembly code is rather trivial.  Note:  Aztec C DOES NOT create
modules that can be bound immediately.  It is only capable of generating
assembly code.  Hence it can be rather slow to compile (the C compiler alone
is significantly slower than BDS C).

You should also note that it supports a Z80 mode that allows register
variables (8080 version syntax permits register vars. but stores them
in memory).  In tight loops you will notice a BIG difference.  In 8080
mode, execution speed seems to be similar to BDS C.

Subject: faster hard-disk warmboot?
From: bridger@rand-unix

	Setting the CP/M directory checksum word to zero in the disk
parameter header of a hard-disk drive does not appear to eliminate
the re-building of the allocation vector bit-map on each warm-boot and
login-drive function.  Has anyone attempted to limit this to cold-boots,
so that control-C will be essentiallyinstantaneous for hard-disk drives?
Are there problems with this approach--DUPUSER, for example, needs an
upda ting of  the vector in some cases.

Long long ago, someone asked how to simulate a ^P ...
well, there is a magic location in the BDOS that contains a 1
if the output to the console is to be echoed to the printer,
and a 0 for no echo to the printer...

here are two (bds) c functions to turn the printer echo on
and off:

prt_on() {
	char	*pbyte;
	char	**bdosp;

	bdosp = 6;	/* the jump address into bdos */

	pbyte = *bdosp + 0x307;	/* pbyte now points to the printer flag */

	*pbyte = 1;
}

prt_off() {
	char	*pbyte;
	char	**bdosp;

	bdosp = 6;	/* bdos jump address */

	pbyte = *bdosp + 0x307;

	*pbyte = 1;
}

and now you have it.

this is for cp/m 2.2 only (as far as i know), and i can provide
the same two functions in another language, if you like...

Jim,

The UMODEM/MODEM7xx pair work nicely for download text (and object)
for UNIX to CP/M and back again.  UMODEM, written in C, runs on UNIX
and supports the public domain modem protocol, and MODEM7xx, written
in assembly language, runs on UNIX and supports the same protocol.
UMODEM has had some problems running through the ARPA Net, but runs
fine in direct connect to UNIX.

Both programs are in the public domain and available in source code
form on MIT-MC.

Subject: MDM710 now available
To: INFO-CPM@brl

MDM710, the latest in the MODEM7 series, is now available from MIT-MC as
   AR61:CPM;MDM710 LBR
   AR61:CPM;MDM710 TXT
The LBR file is stored in ITS "COM style" binary format, may be FTP'ed
by those who can use binary mode or TENEX mode in FTP.  The four-byte
ITS header may be removed on YOUR CP/M system by running my ITSCVT
program.  It's available as AR13:CPM;ITSCVT HEX.  You'll need LU.COM
(the library utility program) to extract the files from the LBR.

Additional detailed information on MDM710:

TOPIC :  MODEM710 PHONE MODEM GENERAL INTEREST DATA

FROM  :  IRV HOFF W6FFC

DATE  :  22 JUNE 83


     MDM710 is the latest in the "MODEM7" telephone modem series.  After
MODEM 7.98, the program became known as MDM700, etc.  At that time the
external macro library was combined into the source code plus other
changes.  Numerous overlay files were added for various computers to
make the program useful for a large number of different systems.  Orig-
inally it worked only with the PMMI plug-in modem for the S-100 bus.  It
now also supports the Hayes 300 and 1200 and U. S. Robotics modems.  It
is the only modem program that offers auto-dialing and auto-continuous
redialing for all these modems.


     Overlay files are included in MDM710.LBR for Apple, Datapoint, NEC,
Heath H89, Kaypro, Morrow, Osborne, PMMI, Televideo, Xerox and Zenith.
There is also a "general purpose" overlay to readily adapt to other sys-
tems not mentioned.

     MDM710 has numerous changes over previous programs.  The MDM710.UPD
update file lists many of these changes.  It is in the MDM710.LBR group.
There are 13 overlay files for various computers and one additional file
for easily changing the phone number library.  MDM710.IQF explains what
each of the programs is for, plus has some comments similar to these re-
garding how to use the overlays in the easiest manner.

     Let's say you have a Heath H89, for example.  You would wish to get
(download) the following three files from that library group:

     MDM710H8.AQM	(Heath overlay file)
     MDM710.COM		(Master Object code, ready to use for PMMI)
     MDM710.DQC		(Squeezed instruction guide)

and perhaps the MDM710.UQD update file:
 
     You would unsqueeze MDM710H8.AQM, edit the options to if not set
the way you prefer, then assemble it (ASM.COM is fine).  Refer to the
instructions in the overlay file to combine the MDM710.COM file with the
MDM710H8.HEX file you just got when assembling MDM710H8.ASM.  All this
will only take a few minutes.   It is actually very simple.  The program
is then ready to use.  If unfamilar with this type modem program, read
MDM710.DOC and try it out.

     0103H  FF for PMMI, 00 if not PMMI
     0104H  FF for Hayes Smartmodem 300 or 1200 or US Robotics
     0105H  54 for touch-tone dialing or 50 for pulse-dialing
                   (only applicable for the Hayes or Robotics)	

     These bytes are automatically selected when edited into the approp-
riate overlay.

========================================================================

      If you have never downloaded a particular file from a library
      group, you can do it this way:  Use LDIR to see what is in the
      library:

B>LDIR MDM710   <ret>      shows contents of the .LBR group
B>LTYPE MDM710 MDM710.UQD  types the MDM710.UQD file for your inspection
B>XMODEM L MDM710 MDM710.COM   downloads the  .COM file only

Subject: How CP/M can determine disk format.
To: STEVE@mit-mc
cc: INFO-CPM@mit-mc, PLEHN@mit-mc

Steve, read the FORMATDOC file in AR47:CPM;  I think that will
answer your question.

The neat part of the format byte scheme is that the byte can be
read without any head stepping since it is on the outer track.
This makes it possible, for instance, to read a 48-TPI
five inch diskette in a 96-TPI drive.  Having read the format
byte the software can determine that double-stepping is necessary
is necessary.

My Northstar Horizon is equipped with three TEAC half-height, 960-TPI
,double sided drives plus a Tandon "Quad" (48-TPI, double-sided). I can
read the quad-written disks perfectly in any of the 96-TPI drives, including
correct calculation and display of disk capacity, remaining space, etc.
by STAT and other programs.  The "Quad" drive is retained only so that
I can WRITE Quad diskettes, to be read in standard Horizon or
Advantage configurations (which use Quad drives).

Hope this info is useful.  The BIOS source that does all this
(for N* disk controller) is also in AR47:CPM;

In the first line of the 3rd para, should read "96-TPI" not "960-TPI".
Incidently, capacity of the 96-TPI

Subject:  ZCPR2 Utilities under CP/M

Yesterday Keith asked if the ZCPR2 utilities can be run under normal
CP/M 2.2, and we thought the response may be of general interest.
By and large, the answer is YES.  The GENINS program must be run on
all of the utilities to do this.

GENINS is used to install utilities in a ZCPR2 environment, and such
utilities can be installed with all ZCPR2-specific features turned
off.  As a result, the utility does not try to reach into ZCPR2 for
buffers and the like, and ZCPR2 and CP/M are identical to it.  The
installer need only turn off all of the ZCPR2-specific features:
no external path, no multiple command line (address 0), no memory-based
named directories, no disk-based named directories, etc.

Most utilities will continue to function with these turned off.
Some, however, like MENU, will not, since their function is based on
using ZCPR2.  These utilities will tell you they can not run if you
try to run them after turning off the features.

One nice feature in all of this is that by turning off external paths,
the internal paths, if you so desire, become operational.  In other
words, utilities may use their internal paths under CP/M 2.2 to perform
their functions.  Hence, file searches performed by the utilities still
work, and some ZCPR2 functions, in a limited sense, are moved into the
CP/M 2.2 arena.

Charlie, I inquired on behalf of another in my department.  Last I saw,
(yesterday) a text or .com file I sent up to the vax came back down with
matching crc (crck).  My colleague is having some difficulty with the
format of sequential files that the VAX creates, which is why he wanted
it in the first place.  It seems that someone is not converting record
delimiters properly or some such.  My colleague said that he had to
shorten one comment line in XMODEM.FOR to get it to compile correctly.
Within the week, we should have more info on just what's going on.  Ron.
 P.S. to the group - sorry about mis-mailing the administrative note to

    Anyone who would even think of comparing UNIX to CP/M is out of their

    simple operating system. THAT IS IT.

    UNIX(tm), on the other hand is the best development enviroment around. It

    People who compare the two are showing their ignorance.

Subject:  Creation of INFO-UNIX, in concert with UNIX-WIZARDS

INFO-UNIX is intended for Question/Answer discussion, where "novice"
system administrators can pose questions.  Hopefully, enough people
who know some answers will subscribe so that the list serves a purpose.
I plan to subscribe, and I know that others will be generous with their
time too.

UNIX-WIZARDS should then (hopefully) devolve into more technical
discussions, including comments about doing kernels for esoteric
hardware, nasty bugs, discussion of what we might want to see
in 4.3 BSD now that 4.2 is nearly out, etc.

The motivation behind this split is to provide a mechanism for
"real wizards" to communicate, in a less cluttered forum than
at present, yet still offer a "helper service" to new UNIX sites
and new system administrators.  I expect that there will be a great
deal of overlap between the two lists, but that people at the
extremes will be able to choose one list over another.

I would also hope that much of the discussion of UNIX on small
(micro) computers can be moved from INFO-MICRO, INFO-CPM, etc,
into INFO-UNIX, which is where it belongs.

To reiterate, submissions to the lists should be sent to:

	UNIX-WIZARDS @ BRL-VGR		or @ BRL
	INFO-UNIX @ BRL-VGR		or @ BRL

and discussions with the moderator (me), not for publication, should go to:

	UNIX-WIZARDS-REQUEST @ BRL-VGR	or @ BRL
	INFO-UNIX-REQUEST @ BRL-VGR	or @ BRL

Both lists are being gatewayed to the News Network (USENET)
by the good graces of SRI-UNIX.

In order to start things off on the right foot, all subscribers to
UNIX-WIZARDS have also been placed on the INFO-UNIX mailing list.
If you wish to be removed from one or the other, simply send a note
to the appropriate -request mailbox.

Best,

Maybe this message clarifies better:

As you know, they are two entirely different worlds. CP/M was written
as a very simple system which lets a single user talk to his small
(micro) computer.  UNIX was written for use on DEC minicomputers,
which are much larger than any micro, and permits multi-tasking,
multi-user operation of a type that CP/M could never handle.  CP/M is
a single-user operating system.  To compare them is like comparing a
Volkswagen to a MACK truck.  Each of them has its uses, but they're
simply two different breeds of  cat.

I am willing to open my ear if there is such a system that CP/M can be
"multi-" system.

Article-I.D.: aplvax.144

	I have owned an Osborne I for about eight months, and have
reached that inevitable stage where I want to upgrade.
	Since my Osborne came with single density disk drives, they will
be my first target.  I have just ordered a double density upgrade kit
from a company called Osmosis in San Francisco.  The kit is supposed to
be idiot-proof, requiring only that I plug in a few connectors.
It sells for only $195, at least a hundred dollars below the lowest dealer
quote I received.
	Another possibility is a RAM disk emulator called DriveC (sold I think
by a small outfit of the same name) that uses the IEEE488 interface and slides
comfortably into one of the two diskette storage slots on the front of the
computer.
	Does anyone have any info to share about either of these companies or
products?
	I would also appreciate *any* info about:
		- interfacing external floppies or hard disks to the IEEE488
		  port.  How do I modify CPM to handle this?
		- any other interesting (and affordable) Osborne after-market
		  upgrades and/or accessories that you know about.

Subject:  Reading/writing multiple format disks

A recent message posted to Info-Cpm told of an expensive disk controller
card and drive which can be added to an existing S-100 system to allow
reading/writing to many different disk formats.

Some were skeptical when I replied that you didn't need to buy that
expensive disk controller when you could get a whole KAYPRO-II
computer for about the same price and use a "new program" to do the
same thing.  Well, here's the complete info on that new program.  It
does exist and it does work.

---forwarded message from CP-MIG on CompuServe---

Fm: George Antunes 71535,1507

If you have access to a Kaypro there is a program you can run which
will let you read, write, & format in about 15 different formats (all
5-1/4 inch, single sided).  I recently bought a copy ($39.00) and like
it a lot.  The program is called Uniform and is available from Micro
Solutions, 125 South 4th St., DeKalb, Illinois 60115.  Phone is (815)
756-3421.  They have been selling dealers a license to make & sell
unimited copies of the software for $2000.

They are in the process of completing versions which will RUN on the
Morrow Microdecision & Osborne; both of those formats are among those
which are supported on version which runs on the Kaypro. You might give
them a call & see if they want to swap information with you.  I found
them pleasant & cooperative.

---end of forwarded messsage---

Now that the Kaypro-IV which has double-density-double-sided drives is
available, it will be just a matter of time before you can read/write
to almost any 5-1/4" format by using the Kaypro.

Subject:  Re:  CP/M vs. Unix

In all of these recent discussions,  I  feel  that  an  important
point  is being missed.  I fully agree that CP/M, UNIX, VMS, ITS,
etc, are different "breeds of cat," and I don't think that anyone
would  question  this.   In  the  world  in  which I find myself,
however, I have access, in one form or another, to ALL  of  these
breeds of cat, and I find that I am constantly comparing them.

The comparison is not from the point  of  view  of  the  internal
operation  of  the system, but from the point of view of a tool I
can use to run an application.  Attributes  such  as  quality  of
tools,  speed  of  tools,  availability of system, reliability of
system, ease of use of tools, familiarity with tools, and quality
and  availability  of  documentation are considered when I make a
selection.

As a user, I find that the fact that TENEX is a  multitasking  OS
with  a  signficant  degree  of power to be inconsequential in my
decision- making process.  The  fact  that  the  TENEX  system  I
access  is  often  heavily-loaded when I need it and that it runs
very slowly, causing me to expend significantly more time than if
I  used  the  UNIX system I access causes me to stay away from it
for the most part.  With these attributes in mind, of all of  the
systems  I  access,  my  personal  ZCPR2  system  comes closer to
filling the requirements than the others.  I  am  even  into  the
mode these days of programming in FORTRAN-77 using the WordMaster
and WordStar editors under ZCPR2 and then uploading the result to
VAX/VMS  for compilation and testing.  Minor problems, of course,
are corrected using EDT on the VAX,  and  the  final  version  is
downloaded to ZCPR2 for further work and backup.

So, I would like to say that it DOES make sense to compare  these
widely  different  operating  systems, especially if the basis of
comparison is the user interface  and  the  attributes  I  listed
above.   People will soon be finding that they have an increasing
number of choices like this to make.  As a plug,  for  my  money,
ZCPR2  and  UNIX (depending on application) are the winners, with
VAX/VMS running second.  Of course, the machines they are running
on make a difference in this choice.

        Rick
