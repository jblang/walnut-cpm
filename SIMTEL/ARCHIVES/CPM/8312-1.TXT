A charitable organization in the Washington, DC area would like to receive a
donation of a computer. The donor would get a tax credit based on his/her
valuation of the hardware and software.

This would be an excellent opportunity to do a good deed and recover one's
investment so that a newer configuration could be purchased.

Please contact me to discuss this further. My telephone at work is 703/827-6938

I saw an accessory for the C-64 computer that allows it to run CP/M.
A local discount store has these boards on sale for $70.
-- This means that a complete CP/M system (64K) with two driives would cost
about $800.  My question:  Has anybody had any experience with a C64 running
CP/M?  Is this a "standard" CP/M or are there strange quirks, like the
Microsoft/Apple CP/M?

Article-I.D.: phs.2165

I have one of these CP/M cartrages for a C64.  I havent used it much yet
so I cant be sure but the manual is a duplicate of the standard one so that
much is standard.  The max memory is reduced because the screen is bit
mapped and the BIOS is completly different since much of it is actualy
entry points to routines running on the other processor.  I think that
most programs which require cursor positioning will not work and could not
be made to work without major rework. Also the screen is a non standard size
which would break many programs. Keep in mind that the screen is a standard
vidio monitor not a crt it is optimized for games and is hard on the eyes
when used for text.  If you have had experience with the first Osborne
I think you can get an idea of what using the C64 CP/M would be like it
had the same non standard screen and BIOS. One question I have not gotten
a satisfactory answer to is how standard the disks it writes are it is
not clear to me that the software houses are making CP/M programs avalable
in a sutable format if anybody knows I would like to hear.
As you say the price cant be beat so perhaps it will find a nitch (as a
training machine perhaps a demo system could be put together using an
existing TV for less than $600).

Greg - I'm using the MDM712 overlay I developed for the TRS-80, Model I
with MDM714 with no difficulties at all.  The one archive overlay I looked
at in the new 714 batch had as its only update notice that its name had been

also that it is very likely to work if you use your 712 MAX-80 overlay with 714.

Does anyone have a reaction to the question of what the relative ruggedness
 (and so reliability) of double vs single sided 5.25in floppy disk drives.  
Am wondering about KayProII (single sided) vs KayPro4 (double sided) for 
use which involves a lot of traveling.  My experience with early double 
sided 8in drives (CalComp/CalDisk 143) was that the heads didn't stay aligned
very well.  Is there a similar problem with more modern 5.25in units.  Thanx.

It sounds like the source files did not transfer correctly.
The *.BLK files contain FORTH screens or blocks.  Each screen
is 1024 printable ASCII characters without carriage returns
or line feeds.  The screens are written sequentially.  Each
screen starts with a comment line of the form:

\ Some kind of title                            16Oct83Map

Here are the results of running the 8080 CRCK program
on the original source disks I tried to upload,
first on the 8080 files:

--> FILE:  CPU8080 .BLK         CRC = 16 7F
--> FILE:  EXTEND80.BLK         CRC = 80 10
--> FILE:  F83     .HEX         CRC =       [I don't have this one]
--> FILE:  F83     .COM         CRC = A1 A8 [This is the loaded F83.HEX]
--> FILE:  META80  .BLK         CRC = AD 86

--> FILE:  UTILITY .BLK         CRC = 21 4F

and on the 8086 files:

--> FILE:  CPU8086 .BLK         CRC = 16 7F
--> FILE:  EXTEND86.BLK         CRC = 80 10
--> FILE:  F83     .CMD         CRC = A1 A8
--> FILE:  META86  .BLK         CRC = AD 86


I checked the TOPS-20 checksum on the blocks that I uploaded
to ECL and to my own TOPS-20 system and they agree so I hope
the problem was in your reception of the files.  Let me know
what checksums you get.

Ted.

In-Reply-To: Message from "Keith Petersen <w8sdz@brl>" of Wed 30 Nov 83 12:37:51-PST

  Thanks for the scoop on using both sides of disks on single headed drives.
I have been using both sides of my disks for about two years and I have NEVER
had a detected error - who knows about those nasty undetected ones! The point o
of this is that I have been hearing horror stories about using both sides of
my disks for quite some time and I have never seen the results of any studies 
that indicate that errors have or definitely will occur. Your message states
that these errors "might" occur or that the "probability" of contamination
increases. Also, performance is reduced - which performance and how much?

I am a little bit doubtful about the validity of claims like this made by a 
disk manufacturer because it is in his best interest - we all have to buy
twice as many disks!

Finally, if the horror stories are true, then think about this scenario:
if I use "flippied" disks, I can fit twice as much data on a disk - so I can 
have a separate, possibly remotely located, back-up copy - for the same cost!
So, if I have either a "normal" failure or a "flippy-induced" failure I still
have a back-up copy. This would seem to provide MORE protection for that 
valuable data we all have.

Another thing - since the liner traps "contaminating-particles", can it become 
overloaded? If so what happens then? How do you know that the liner is full?
It seems that this situation would cause many of the possible failures you 
mentioned also. So, maybe using both sides of a disk would periodically "clean"
the liner out.

Thanks again, and I look forward to a response.    Mike Bishop

Subject:  XMODEM81 now available

     XMODEM81 is now available from SIMTEL20.  Newest features -- can
be assembled with ASM.COM even if LOGCAL is YES.  All overlays renamed
so they will remain independent of XMODEMxx updates.

     The following files are available from SIMTEL20 in the
MICRO:<CPM.RCPM> directory:

XMODEM.81ASM - Source for the main program
XMODEM.81INF - Information about XMODEM81 and its overlays
  XMAC.1ASM  - for Apple users with the Novation APPLE-CAT modem
  XMDP.1ASM  - for Datapoint 1560 with 8251A I/O and CTC baud rate timer
  XMDC.1ASM  - for Apple users with the D.C. Hayes modem
  XMEX.1ASM  - for computers with 8251 I/O and external modems
  XMH8.1ASM  - for Heath/Zenith H8 or H89 users with external modem
  XMHZ.1ASM  - for Heath/Zenith -100 users with external modem
  XMIN.1ASM  - for those using the Compupro Interfacer 3/4 modem
  XMMM.1ASM  - for Apple users with the Micromodem II modem
  XMPM.1ASM  - for S-100 users with PMMI modem boards
  XMSM.1ASM  - for D.C. Hayes Smartmodem users
  XMTV.1ASM  - for TeleVideo 802 computers

     The overlays contain instructions on how to then use DDT (or SID)
to easily adapt the external overlay to the main program.

     XMODEM is a program used primarily on remotely operated RCPM systems
that allows program transfer to and/or from remote users.  It can trans-
fer any type of CP/M file including absolute binary files (.OBJ).

     Originally written by Keith Petersen and based at that time on Ward
Christensen's MODEM ver 2.0 it has since undergone extensive revision.
Although the original checksum verification system is still available on
request, the primary system is CRC - cyclic redudancy checking.

     The current version is XMODEM 8.1  The 8.x series has a number of
features which give it a tremendous flexibility.  Some of them are:

     1) A general purpose menu.  Just type:

	   A0>XMODEM <return> 

	   This menu includes the drive/user area for normal uploading,
	   which lets the user check to see if adequate space is remain-
	   ing for uploading new files at that location.

	   NOTE:  The A0> prompt in this and subsequent examples is used
		  as a typical possibilty of a drive/user area.

     2) Ability to send (download to the remote user) member files from
	   a library group (.LBR)  without having to copy the entire li-
	   brary file.  (Use a separate program called LDIR.COM to find
	   the member names of a library group.)
	        
     3) Ability to specify what disk/user area from which to send a pro-
	   gram so the remote user doesn't have to go to that area first:

	   A0>XMODEM S B6:HELLO.DOC

	   (An option limits the maximum user area.)

     4) Programs can be uploaded to a special non-public user area for
	   the exclusive use of the SYSOP.  These can include replacement
	   programs for one already on some public area, experimental
	   programs you wish him to test before making them public, pre-
	   typed notes for his exclusive reading or any program you wish
	   him to see that is not appropriate for public use at that time.

     5) Ability to download from a special area.  This enables the SYSOP
	   to place special programs, pretyped messages, etc. in this
	   area.  He can then leave a private message on his bulletin
	   board to the person for whom the program is intended.  Al-
	   though any user COULD download that program, only the SYSOP
	   and his intended recepient know its correct name as well as
	   the correct drive/user area.  This provides excellent security
	   The SYSOP can thus make any person an instant temporary priv-
	   ileged user.  This gives him a tremendous flexibility.

     6) Spaces can be used without error.  Example:

	   A0>XMODEM   L   B7:	 CATALOG    CAT2.DOC

	   will send a file called CAT2.DOC from the CATALOG.LBR library.

HEXIFY on TOPS-20 doesn't seem to know about ITS-Binary files.  It
should skip the four-byte header.  I just tried to make MDM714.HEX
from MDM714.COM on SIMTEL20 and when I typed the hex file there
were the 4 bytes - before the JMP at the "real" start of MDM714.COM.
If you have source for this utility please send pointers so we can
re-write it for ITS-Binary files.  Thanks.

Subject:  Re:  Dysan note: Using floppy backside

Mike - I was going to let this issue pass without comment, but since you have
pulled my chain, I just can't keep my big mouth shut any longer.  I totally
agree with your position.  The Dysan arguments are wholly theoretical, and do
not even allude to the existence of ANY corroborating test results.  In
contrast to this, the early Shugart position regarding their opposition to
the use of head cleaning diskettes WAS based on test results, and furthermore,
they then changed that position when better cleaning diskettes became available.
The ON\lY diskettes that have ever given me trouble are made by Dysan, and
that experience includes a considerable number of really cheap (10 disks for
$16) disks.  Furthermore, Dysan disks are among the most expensive available.
(No, I made a mistake there; I did have an experience with early Paragon
Magnetics "Gold" diskettes that were the worst junk I have ever encountered
floppy-wise.  They were so bad that I could see the imperfections with the
unaided eye, and I'm LEGALLY BLIND!)  Anyway, moving right along...
If Dysan had quoted SOME data in support of their position, I'd be a
lot more receptive to their argument.  As it is, I too believe that they are
merely trying to propagate a scare in order to boost their sales.  I have
disassembled several brands of floppies to see how they were made, and the
open weave liners that I have seen certainly appear to be symmetrical in their
ability to trap particles regardless of direction of rotation.  Two closing
comments:  First, many thanks to Keith Petersen for putting forth the effort
to type-in that long article by Dysan.  It has sparked an interesting exchange.
Second, In all fairness, I must admit that I have only experimented with
flippies in a trivial way.  In my very limited experience, I have had no
difficulties, but I don't consider the effort of modifying and cataloging
flippies to be worth the advantages obtained.  Therefore, my treatment of this
subject is also theoretical.

Subject:  Re:  Dysan note: Using floppy backside

My personal approach is to use the floppies re-punched for backside
use as "archive disks".  These are not normally left in the drives
and spend most of their lives "on the shelf" as backups.  I would
never think of using these disks in my drives on a regular basis.
I use nothing but Dysan disks for my "working disks" (disks
which remain in the drives for long periods of time).  My Remote
CP/M system has had Dysan disks in the floppy drives ever since it
first went on-line.  They last about 1-1/2 years, on the average,
in continuous duty service.

Remember that any dirt you "dislodge" is probably going to end up
on the heads and MAY grind into the disk surface.  This isn't
likely to happen with my approach, however, because the disks
are essentially "new" because they don't spend much time in
the drives.

All but X features? Neither this notice nor the MDM714 notice (or

     This implementation of the 1983 FORTH standard was begun in
October 1982 by Mike Perry and Henry Laxen.  Our motivation was
to produce a high quality system that would serve as a model for
vendors and other implementors of FORTH systems based upon the
1983 standard.  We have made it our policy to cooperate with any
vendor who desires to use this model as part of their own FORTH
based product, and intend to continue to do so.  In order to
promote widespread distribution of this model, we have placed it
in the public domain, and encourage use, reproduction, and
improvement, especially the latter.

     We would like to thank many of the local, and not so local
FORTH Interest Group members who have made many valuable
suggestions, discovered bugs, and recommended improvements.
First and foremost we would like to thank Kim Harris for his
support and encouragement, and for the fact that he would not let
us get away with anything questionable.  We would also like to
thank the following who contributed to the FORTH 83 model effort:

Martin Tracy, Wil Baden, John James, Alfred Tang, Steve Taylor,
John Hall, Mike Brockman, Robert Berkey, Daniel Kelley, Gerry
Grismore, Michael Gwilliam, Craig Gonter, Evan Rosen, Stephen
Maguire, Ted Shapin, Owen Thomas, Joel Wittenberg, and others
who have helped along the way.

Keith (et al),

Correct, HEXIFY on Tops-20 doesn't seem to know how to peel off that
4-byte header from ITS-Binary files.  Someone on the net talked about a
TYPE8 program that peels that off, but that ain't much help when you're
dealing with a binary file you're trying to capture!

What I do (you're gonna love this) is HEXIFY the whole doggon thing,
first unwanted 4 bytes and all, and download it.  Invariably with a binary
.COM type file, it ends at a nice even hex boundary, as you'll see when you
load that .HEX file into DDT. 

Try this:  Run DDT (no file name).  Clear a whole bunch of TPA (at least
as big as your .HEX file will need) by filling it with 0's or F's
(F100,3000,00).  Load that .HEX file into DDT 
(IFOOBAR.HEX
 R)
Write down the NEXT available memory after the load.  (Hey, guys, hope
I'm not boring you with this pretty basic DDT stuff, but some out there
may need the walkthrough.)

Look at that area around the NEXT figure (use the D command), and you'll
see the binary code just barely spill over a 100 boundary -- 4 bytes,
to be precise!

Now move the whole  mess 4 bytes down!

M104,2004,100  (say FOOBAR.HEX ended at 2004H)

Look again, and you'll see a real program start at 100H (or wherever
your TPA starts), and a bunch of cryptic stuff (most programs seem to
lump a bunch of DB data stuff at the end) or maybe a nice neat JMP or
RET right at the 100H boundary (2000H for our example).

G0 to get out of DDT and SAVE 32 FOOBAR.COM (for our example; whatever
the appropriate SAVE is for your file).

If it ran in the original form, it'll run now!

Did this for a bunch of stuff; works just fine.  Have fun.

Subject:  BYE3-12 remote console program now available

A new version of BYE, the remote console program that allows others to
use your system via the modem, is now available from SIMTEL20.  It's
called BYE3 version 1.2 (available on RCPMs as BYE3-12.LBR which
includes the main source code and inserts for various hardware
configuations).

Here's an excerpt of a very enthusiastic message I received from
Irv Hoff about BYE3:

---
The BYE3 program has an unique loading routine that does not use any
unusual labels.  It automatically relocates itself, even though you can
assemble it with  ASM.COM  -  MAC.COM is ok, too, just not needed.

On older BYE programs (including BYE2-16, etc.) you had to do a lot of
extra work if you put the program below CCP -- had to run it through the
assembler a few times and look at the  "!" error line to see where the
program ended, with the options you selected, and keep moving it until
it was directly under CCP -- that took some time (and some talent).  You
also had to do a few searches for several addresses so you could insert
those for things like DEST0, WMLOC and OLDBD.  It was a bit of a
nuisance even if you knew exactly what you were doing.

The main problem even then was it would just work on that particular
disk/BIOS, etc.  Unless every disk you might put it on was identical as
far as CP/M, BIOS, etc. was concerned.

This new BYE3 is so very much easier to set up than even BYE2-17, there
is no comparison.  It's a bit like trying to teach somebody to drive a
Buick with automatic transmission vs. a truck with 5-speeds and a dual-
rear axle.

ALL YOU DO, is just edit in your options, (it even picks up the maximum
drive and maxiumum user area from ZCPR automatically if you have USEZCPR
set to "YES"), insert the correct "overlay" at the ++++ area near the
end of the program, assemble with ASM.COM (or MAC.COM, etc.), load and
use.  That's it!  The thing has been tested on four different systems
now.  And works great on several at 300, 450, 600 and 1200.  (A few
modems seem to work at 600 baud on strong local lines, my Bell 212A
works pretty well at 450, but won't work at 600).

This should take everybody's imagination by storm and should replace
BYEII-16 completely.  This makes that obsolete.

I was able to assemble it here for several different Heath systems,
without even asking anybody how much memory they had, how many disks
they used (which changes the length of the BIOS, hence the starting
address of CCP, etc.) in just a few minutes.  Sel (KA6ERF) is very happy
as for the first time he can use the same program on his two different
Heath systems.  One has three disk drives and the other has five -- he
had to use two separate ByeII-16 programs, now he only needs the one.

This should revolutionize the number of people who can rapidly adapt
their equipment to modest RCPM use with no bulletin board system.

The following files are available from SIMTEL20 in the
MICRO:<CPM.BYE3> directory:

BYE3.12ASM - This is the main source code file.  This program
allows modem callers to use your CP/M system just as if they were
seated at the system console.  Special assembly-time options
allow limiting the caller's access by password and/or access to
only a message-service program.  A number of external routines
are available to adapt this program to various computers.

BY3+SMDM.ASM - "Generic Smartmodem" modem control package.  These
routines may be used along with the more specific modem/serial
port/baud rate routines commonly found in the BYE3 package.  A
generic Smartmodem is a modem that may be controlled by a series
of special commands sent to it.  The most famous one is the D.C.
Hayes Smartmodem, but other modems may also be controlled with
this package.  The following modems are known to work with this
package:

   D.C. Hayes Smartmodem           (RS-232 [300 bps only])
   D.C. Hayes Smartmodem 1200      (RS-232)
   U.S. Robotics Password          (RS-232 or S100)
   U.S. Robotics Courier           (Osborne)
   Rixon R-212                     (RS-232)

BY3-1602.ASM - TR1602 I/O routines for TRS-80 Model 3.

BY3-2651.ASM - National Semiconductor 2651 I/O routines for the
CompuPro Interfacer 3, CompuPro Interfacer 4, and CompuPro System
Support 1.

BY3-8250.ASM - for a Western Digital 8250 chip that is hooked up
to an external modem.

BY3-8251.ASM - for a Intel 8251A I/O chip with CTC timer to set
speed.

BY3-89SM.ASM - for the Western Digital 8250 chip that is hooked
up to an external modem.  Works with Heath H89.

BY3-ACAT.ASM - for the Apple ][ running with a Novation Apple-Cat
modem card.

BY3-DATA.ASM - for use with a Datapoint 1560 computer with the
Intel 8251 chip hooked up to an external modem.

BY3-DCH.ASM - for the D.C. Hayes MM100 and 80-103a modem cards.

BY3-HZSM.ASM - for the Heath/Zenith -100 series using the 4.9
Megahertz 2661B I/O with the external Hayes Smartmodem (or
equivalent modem).

BY3-MMII.ASM - for the Apple ][ running with a MicroModem ][
card.  It seems to work on those Apples that even APBYE barfed
on.  The problem was in the Carrier Detect routine, because the
Microsoft Z80 card screws up on a double strobe type of I/O that
they tried to use.  Anyway, that means the Answer Phone routine
is a crock,  but the thing works...

BY3-PMMI.ASM - for the PMMI MM-103 S100 modem card.

BY3-SIO.ASM - for the Zilog SIO chip that is hooked up to an
external modem.  A Z80-CTC is used as the baud rate generator.

BY3-T802.ASM - for the TeleVideo 802 and the AJ1259 Modem.  This
"patch" assumes that you are running a TeleVideo 802 (not an
802-H) with TS-802 CBIOS version 2.1.  It may NOT work with any
other versions.  It may also be used with modems other than the
AJ1259, any 300/1200 "standard" type modem will work (Ventel,
Vadic, Prentice, Rixon, Cermetek, and Smartmodems.)

Does anyone out there have MODEM7 or equivalent already configured for
a Morrow Micro Decision 2?  I would like to get something on single-
sided diskette all ready to go.  Naturally I am willing to supply a
diskette and sufficient money to cover postage and bother.  I would be
eternally (well, for a long time anyway) grateful.

Subject:  Memory size requirements for XMODEM and MDM7xx

XMODEM81 and MDM714 will both work with full features on a 48k
system.  There is no documentation available on the minimum
memory size required, however you can judge from the .COM file
size and the knowledge that XMODEM81 uses a 2k buffer above
the program and MDM714 uses two 16k buffers (one for file
transfers and the other for capture buffer).

Subject:  Re:  Hexify for Tops-20

Thanks for the info on how to strip the ITS-Binary headers using DDT,
Dave, but that won't work for files larger than the available TPA space
(below DDT).  Try ITSCVT.COM.  It's a program I wrote (to run on your
CP/M system) that will take ANY length ITS-Binary file, strip the
header, and write out a new file (retaining the old one) called
filename.CPM.  Run it without an arguement to get instructions on its
use. It's available on SIMTEL20 as MICRO:<CPM.HEX>ITSCVT.HEX

Note: The following assumes (ass.u.me) that the tops modem
program that you are refering to uses the Ward Christianson
Modem2 protocol.  If not, then all bets are off.

-------

Insure that the XON/XOFF protocol is disabled on the entire
link.  We ran into that same problem here using the LocalNet.
It turns out that the header for block 19 contains a ^S and
17 contains ^Q.  This caused us to lock up on block 18, with
the same symptoms that you reported at block 16.  Could your
XOFF value have been changed to 11H, the header value for block
17?

I do not believe that speed (1200) has anything to do with your
problem, as the maximum buffer size that you need is one block (128)
and a bit (header and trailer), as the next block will not be sent 
without an ACK, which is generated by Modem, not the tops 20.

The only problems we have ever had with speed, is loss of sync
when printing an error message to the screen on a micro while the
header is being sent, an simple timeouts on the vax due to heavy
system loading.

Ok, guys...I'm at the disassembly stage, and would prefer to avoid it
if I can...so let's see if I can get some use out of the net.

I've an Osborne I with CP/M 2.2, and have been using ZCPR1 for some
time. (Yah, I know, but it's hardly worth the effort to put ZCPR2 on
an Osborne...)  Recently, I purchased a real-time clock that requires
me to do a MOVCPM of 1K.  Ok, no problem...but it lost my CCP!  By
lost I mean...it somewhere got a copy of the old CCP!  Obviously, I've
tried to recompile ZCPR with the new offset, and it goes into
never-never land when force-fed to the moved CP/M.  So my query is:

	-Where is the old CCP coming from? (I've used DU to search the
	 diskette for byte strings characteristic of CCP--no luck)

	-Has anyone else tried to install ZCPR on a MOVCPM'd system?  Any
	 problems? (Particularly with an Osborne...)

I'm not holding my breath, but I'd love a response....

I am trying to use the CAL feature of MDM712 and MDM712NM with
the alternate dialing sequence.  I have defined ALTDIAL1 and
ALTDIAL2 in MDM712NM, along with an entry that looks like
	DB  'V=Xyxxy.............<333' ;'V'
(I.e., after the alternate access code, I only need an extension
number.)  When I try to "CAL V" it just dials the extension,
not the whole sequence.

Has anyone else run into this or even used the alternate access
feature ("<" or ">")?  Is this a bug that's been fixed in MDM713?

Several RCPMs are carrying a file called XMODEM81.BUG which tells about
a label error in XMODEM80.ASM and XMODEM81.ASM.  The error only occurs
when a large user overlay area is required.  The XMODEM81.ASM file on
SIMTEL20 has already been fixed to correct this error.  If you got
XMODEM81.ASM from another source, you'll want to read the fix shown
below:

---
... 11-26-81
... XMODEM81 quirk

For those of you who have a non-standard sized IO patch area, you will
find that the label name  IOSIZE  in past releases has been changed to 
LARSIZE.  While this change was made in the setup portion of the main
source file, the name change was not made at the  ORG  statement just
above the label  BEGIN: .

Be sure that this change is made before trying to assemble the main
file, otherwise your assembler will burp with an  "Unknown Label" 
error.

Dear Rick:

I presume that you are refering to ZCPR to take the place of the CCP in
CP/M 3.0.  Even if you are not, I still have a response.  I use ZCPR on
a CP/M 2.2 system and have found no bugs.  However, the question you asked
about the submit system triggered this response.  I am not sure of what
you are talking about with the memory resident submit.  I would like
to say that my application of submit is for very large batch streams
used to test compilers.  These streams takeup hundreds of lines and
consume the better part of a day to completely get through.  So the 
point to all of this jawing is that you should not put an arbitrary limit
on the size of a submit file which is unreasonable small.  Also, the
ability to nest submit files is very nice in this application.

Article-I.D.: ihuxq.397

I have an application for a microprocessor based controller and would
like to know some things about the sinclair zx-81:

1)How much RAM,ROM is avialable?

2)Can standard 2732/2716/2764 EPROMS be used in it?

3)How easy is it to interface to??

4)Does it have any real-time interrupts? (I want to implement a soft-ware
clock with it).

5)How is the doc?? Any good books??

6)I plan to write my control program in z-80 assembly, are there any
defined entry points to the io in it??

I had originally planned to buy a STD-buss z-80 card but they
run about $300, and i think that i can get a zx-81 for under $100.
The nice thing about staying with a z-80 based controller is that I
can used my cp/m system to develope the software for it.

Has anyone used a zx-81 as a controller??

If so please respond by mail.

Thanks in advance .

Re:   [Keith Petersen:  Memory size requirements for XMODEM and MDM7xx]

Keith - I think you have made an error in assessing the amount of memory
needed to run MDM714.  While I haven't looked to see exactly how much of
the 17K allocated for disk storage of the COM file is actually used, it
must be between 16 and 17K since my system allocates in 1K blocks.  With
two 16K buffers, that adds up to at least 48K, which leaves no room for
the operating system in a 48K machine.

ZCPR2 is available from SIG/M in volumes (reverse order):

        124-125, 122 (upgrades)
        98-107 (original release)

Vols 98 and  102  contain  the  command  processor  and  original
release  of the utilities (COM file form only).  Vol 124 contains
upgrades to several utilities (COM  file  form  only).   Vol  104
contains  the installation and concepts manuals, and vols 105 and
106 contain the user's guide.  The documentation in vols  104-106
are  Word Star files.  The volumes outlined in this paragraph are
the minimum you should obtain to bring up ZCPR2.  The rest of the
disks contain sources to everything, online documentation, and an
8080 version of some of  the  utilities.   SIG/M  provides  these
disks  for  $5/vol  plus  shipping  and handling, which is $1 for
first disk and $0.50 for each additional.  These six disks  would
run for $33.50.

SIG/M provides the software on 8" CP/M single-density disks.   If
you  have  a  local RCP/M, the core software is becoming more and
more available.  Also, since printing out  the  documentation  is
such  a  hastle, the New York Amateur Computer Club, Inc, and the
San Diego Computer Society have printed the documentation for you
and  are  selling  it (NYACC is selling it as three vols of their
software catalog,  and  San  Diego  as  a  stand-alone  package).

Creation of ZCPR3 is now underway, but the release date is not

If you find an answer, please broadcast it to the world as it is a real need.

We have transmitted dbaseII .cmd files using the IBM async package to 
modem7xx buffer with good result. You may have to insert line feeds, then
remove them with your editor. The IBM package allows these options when 
sending, but not receiving...grrrr. We packaged several files together.
The buffer in our version of mdm712 has about 34 or 35K Bytes available.
Its very easy to do.

To: info-cpm@brl.ARPA, pur-ee!uiucdcs!uiucuxc!delong@ucb-vax.ARPA

I know this has circulated before, but since there is another
question about it--

I have used PC-Talk Version 3 on an IBM PC under PC-DOS to 
transfer files with CP/M machines running MODEM7.
PC-Talk supports the MODEM7/XMODEM/Christenson (sp?)
protocol for single file transfer, but not batch
transfer.  It has worked fine for me at 9600 baud.
PC-Talk is "freeware", which means you can copy and distribute
it for free, but the author would appreciate your sending him
$35 if you like it. If you do this, you will get updates
in the future.  I got my copy for free from the local
IBM PC users group.

If you want to transfer to the IBM running CP/M-86, that's
another matter, which I have not yet confronted.
However, I did bring up "cmodem.c" (from the SIMTEL archives)
on a Zenith Z-100 running ZDOS (MS-DOS) and the Lattice C
compiler. Presumably you could get it to run under CP/M-86
by using the DRI C compiler or another one.

Good luck. If you need more info, contact me.

I found a certain amount of educational software (CP/M math exercises and
the like) in SIMTEL20's MICRO:<CPMUG.VOL037>.

If you don't want to download the directory, grab it out of ABN.ISCAMS@usc-isid.

(You can, of course, not download the Craps program also included in that
CPMUG volume if you wish to protect the innocence of your students.)

If you have no way to FTP, contact me.

Subject: JANUS/ADA info request

I am considering buying the RR software Janus (ADA-like) compiler.
Does anyone out have any experience with this product?  Specifically, I
am interested in the following (and any other comments people have).

1. Is it a reasonable alternative to Pascal/MT+? That is, can it be
used for most of the same applications, does it have the same
extensions for hardware and operating-system dependent stuff (like
absolute addresses, access to BDOS, random-access disk IO, etc).

2. How much of ADA(tm) is in there, and what (if any) "indispensable"
features are missing?

3. Does it compile in a reasonable, finite time?

4. Is it small enough to allow non-trivial programs to be compiled in
limited memory (64K) and disk (2 x 180K) space?

5. Is the expanded "system development" package worth the extra 100
bucks (400 vs. 300)?

6. Any serious bugs?

7. Support?

8. Particularly nice features?

9. Particularly bad features?

Since the answers to many of these questions will be dependent on the
system the compiler is used on, I shoulkdd point out that I am
interested in the 8-bit CPM-based version, to run on an Osborne 1 (64K,
double density=2 x 185K, no hard disk.  All comments appreciated, I
will collect mail responses and forward to anyone who is interested, or
post if there is sufficient interest.

Incidentally, please do not flame at me about how much more wonderful
language X is, and what an idiot I am for considering PASCAL and JANUS
when FOOBAR exists.  Thanks ,

Subject: kermit,Cromemco
From: gray@su-dsn

Some comments and questions on Kermit v. 3.5.  I had two problems
assembling cpmbase.m80--1)the assembler objected to having a label
cmifi10 as well as a label cmifi1, which is
consistent with my manual saying that the first 6 characters must be
unique. Admittedly I have an old version of m80, but has this
limitation been changed? 2) My assembler also objected to the 
"push a" instructions, but was happy when they were changed
to "push af". How come?

A more important comment to any who might be using Cromemco equipment:
My system is essentially a Cromemco System 3 with the PerSci drives
removed (junked with malice) and replaced by
a Morrow 10MB hard disk and a Morrow
floppy. The CP/M for this system is by MICAH, who does a lot of CP/M
systems for cromemco hardware. While the system is generally good, it
does NOT implement the standard IOBYTE as claimed and hence Kermit does
not work. The problem is that BAT: is connected to a single port for
both input & output, it does not input from RDR and output to LST as
the CP/M manuals say it should.  Everything else about the IOBYTE seems
to be o.k. Has anyone encountered a system with a similar fault? Can it
be fixed by a nonexpert in the innards of CPM?

Subject:  BYE3-12 updated to BYE3-13

On SIMTEL20 MICRO:<CPM.BYE3>BYE3-12.ASM has been updated to BYE3-13.ASM.
Steve Sanders of the Tampa Bay RCPM made the following updates:

12/07/83 Added missing labels for PWMSG and WRGMSG and also the IF
  v1.3   statement missing before NULLS (IF NOT OXGATE).  Also added
         the newest SMINIT and MDQUIT routines extensively tested
         and used on-line (3 months) with BY2-17KS.

This program allows modem callers to use your CP/M system just as if
they were seated at the system console.  Special assembly-time options
allow limiting the caller's access by password and/or access to only a
message-service program.  This is based on a program written by Dave
Jaffe in January, 1979.  A number of external routines are available
to adapt this program to various computers.

If the option BYELOW is set 'NO' it automatically locates itself above
the BIOS at top of memory.  Otherwise it sits just below CCP, not re-
quiring any alteration in the location of CP/M via MOVECPM.

BYE3 supports the following modems and/or USART combinations:

1602            - by Paul Traina        BY3-1602.ASM

If you are using either a Hayes Smartmodem, U.S. Robotics or a Rixon
type modem, you must install the "BY3+SMDM" module which contains the
code needed to initialize the Smartmodem and then set the SMODEM op-
tion to 'YES'.

Keith - I think there is no problem with a 48K system.  At source
label getmax the amount of free memory available for use as a
print-buffer is determined.  this value, called MAXRAM, is then used
at label CHKPRNT to manage the print-buffer.  If you opt to blow-away
the CCP, you get 2K more space to play with. So MDM714 should work
fine in a 48K system, but you'll have something like 10-12K for the
print-buffer instead of 16K.

Hi,

	I hope this is not taken as some sort of advertisement, given all
the hoopla on the net recently I thought I would state this, but I think
I may know where you may find the assembler you are looking for at a resonable
price. This z80 relocatable macro will assemble files as large as your disk
space also has conditional assembly, plain english error messages an it will
link up to 400 files together. The price is 49.50. I have'nt used it I just
saw the add so view this message as a pointer only. However I have
ordered a 6800 cross assembler from them (79.50) a few days ago so I have'nt
received it yet.

Herb;
	It is my understanding that the commands for using rez and resource
are (for the most part) identical; rez was, as I recall, developed by modifying
resource. Try the rez doc's instructions. 
	If all else fails, use rez and one of the public-domain z80 assemblers;
chances are that what you are disassembling only uses the 8080 subset of z80
instructions anyway, and zilog mnemonics are easy to learn. One version of
rez (or is it an option rez offers -- I can't recall) produces TDL mnemonics,
which are intel 8080 mnemonics with intel-like extensions to cover z80
instructions.

DASM is yet another Z80 disassembler, derived from ZZSOURCE which was
derived from RESOURCE.  DASM, however, provides full Zilog Z80 mnemonics
with one overlay and TDL mnemonics with another overlay (the overlays are
specified at assembly time).  DASM is in the PD.

All of the non-alphanumeric characters in TOPS-20 filenames, except a

NetLandians,

I've been hacking around in my Morrow Decision I CBIOS (having a grand time),
and need some pointers/advice.

1.  Implementing the Iobyte.  Sure, I can attempt to scratch-write it, but
am hesitant since Morrow didn't in the first place.  Did anyone? Did Morrow,
and I don't have the update?  Is it impossible because of the funny stuff
you have to do, switching the Multi/o board to use the same port address
for peripherals?  Read an article in a CP/M book (extracts from Creative
Computing or something), telling how to do it in a NorthStar BIOS, but
that ain't much help.

2.  Buffered keyboard.  Followed with avid interest a column in Byte where
some brave adventurers were trying it, and they (I think) finally gave up
or found a simplistic solution or something.  Any pointers to articles,
public domain stuff, etc.  (I'm running a Liberty Electronics Freedom 100
terminal, and it won't give me that onboard the terminal alone either.)

3.  Trapping the peculiar Function keys on the Freedom 100 WITHIN THE BIOS
or BDOS!  (Got pointers from kind souls on a Public Domain program that'll
do that; haven't been able to access SIMTEL20 to get it and try; suspect
the differences in Morrow CBIOS might make it a problem.)  Reason:  Function
keys put out ^A, a character or two (forget), and CR.  And we ALL know the
undocumented functions of ^A in Microsoft BASIC-80 2.2, don't we?  (Yeah,
repeats the last command, which is likely to be "RUN".)

4.  Implementing a (new?) CP/M call (ho, boy - no flames about tampering
with the sacred, please) -- Check Status of Reader and/or Punch.  Reason:
Wanna use that third serial port (1 for terminal, 1 for printer, 1 for modem)
as a fully capable port simultaneously with the other two so I can (a)
relay between two modems, simultaneously print to printer and a bar code
printer, and other daydreams.  And NOT have to write specific software to
check the third port (like I have with MDM714 and KERMIT) - just use STAT
and other common utilities.

5.  Stuff in some more memory.  Who can GUARANTEE a nice fat 256- or
512-Kb memory board (static like I presently have or good dynamic) that'll
work with my buss and CPU board and DMA and all the other Morrow goodies?

6.  Stuff in a 68000 CPU board.  Read wonderful things about Compupro's
board, but all configurations seem to indicate ALL Compupro boards on the
bus (and preferably a Compupro buss too!).  What Morrow stuff would I have
to yank out and replace to make such a wonderful thing happen?  (Would like
to keep the Z80 right where it is for some sort of dual-processor capability.)

7.  In return for asking the world, I offer:  (probably only of much use
to Decision I owners)

    a.  A lovely patched CBIOS (and one wee little patch in the CCP) that'll
give you the user area (in decimal) by the disk identifier and CP/M ">"
(from Public Domain, but all done for you --forget the name of the genius
author, but more glory to him/her - think it was called CPMUSER - is out on
SIMTEL20 MICRO:).  Also get the default "look to Drive A, same User Area,
if not here; then look to Drive A, User Area 0) for alll file access.  Works
great with hard disk and floppies.  (Again, Public Domain, forget author,
but wonderful, wonderful.  Works for all but some overlaid programs like
WordStar.)  Also get the modified FINDBAD that'll use the BIOS disk parameters
to work on any CP/M system to locate and exile (by writing to a BAD file)
any bad sectors.  Works perfectly.  Also get KERMIT, fully patched and
documented for the Decision I and Multi/o board (works perfectly).  Also
get my upgraded MDM714 with settable parity (a la KERMIT - stole it and am
busily patching it in), fully set up for the Decision I (thanks to the
Public Domain overlay plus a bit of my hacking).  Also get my KERMIT version
that'll allow straight upload and download with no packetizing (a la MDM714's
capability while in Terminal mode) for when the lines are clean or there isn't
a KERMIT or MDM on the other end (stole it from MDM714 and am busily patching
it into CPMBASE.M80 (Decision I version) right now).

All this I promise you (promises, promises).  And naturally I'll hack whatever
you give me up a bit, and even keep you posted of the changes!

Those whose mailboxes I just overflowed -- sorry - bored you to tears with
this Decision I stuff.  But maybe other CP/M type machines out there need
some of the same fixes?  Let's see what happens.

Regards, and thanks to all for everything you've done for me so far in the
world of Public Domain.

Subject: U.S. Robotics S-100 1200 baud modem: a note

    I recently sent a request to Info-CPM about the U.S. Robotics
S-100 autodial modem, which is being advertised just about
everywhere for very low (< $400) prices.  I got a number of
responses, and was also sent a collection of reviews of various
cheap 1200 baud modems.

    Anyway, I just thought I'd add my reactions to the USR 1200
baud S-100 modem to the dung heap...

    First, *FLAME ON!* -- they didn't include schematics with the
creature.  To me, this is inexcusable.  When I get an S-100
board, I like to know what's in it, and I like to have a
schematic around to modify it if it comes down to that.  I have
sent them a letter about this, and we shall see whether it's
simply an oversight or if it's against their policy to include
schematics, or what.

    Second, the thing powers up in auto-answer mode.  While I'm
sure a lot of people like this, I don't.  I'd rather not have the
modem answer until I tell it to.  The manual suggests that I
could put something in my BIOS to disable this feature.  Well, I
could do that, sure.  But I'd rather have an on-board switch
which would enable/disable auto-answer upon reset or power up. 
As it is now, whenever I have my computer on and somebody calls,
I have to tell them to either hang up (and I'll call back) or
ride out the 17 odd seconds while the machine waits for a
response.

    Third, the manual reminds me a lot of the things I got with
our old IMSAI.  They are poorly written, poorly organized, and
seem to be photocopies, stapled together at one corner.  Still,
it does contain the information -- it's just a matter of finding
it.

    Fourth, the on-board "speaker" (it looks like more of a
buzzer) produces some rather raspy noises which are alleged to be
the sounds of the call in progress.  Well, maybe, but I'd rather
listen through a small 8 ohm speaker, which I intend to hook up
later this evening.

    Finally, when the board powers up, it is in the "off-hook"
state.  That is, it has the phone line off hook.  This means, of
course, that until you tell it to "drop" the line, your line is
busy and cannot be used even for outgoing calls, as the modem
puts a rather annoying hiss on the line.  The manual was good
enough to suggest a fix for this -- it mentions a diode which can
be cut out.  I have done this, and it now behaves a bit better. 
It [the manual] also points out that this could be fixed by
adding something to one's BIOS.

    Now comes the surprising part: It's really a pretty good
product.  My flaming above is really about some pretty trivial
matters.  I have the feeling that U.S.R. will come across with a
schematic for the beast, and then I can sit down and do some
modifications.

    So, the end result is something like this:  If you don't mind
the aforementioned things, and/or if you are looking for an
inexpensive S-100 1200 baud modem, the U.S.R. S-100 might be
worth looking into.

                                       Phil

Ron (et al)

I queried 1LT Pires about that momentous database (and the hardware he
planned to run it on).  Turns out the specs he discussed (6000 records,
1000 characters per record, 250 chars per field, 48 fields) were MAX,
way out, absolute extremes for each specification, and not all together!
In other words, nope, he won't have one huge DB with 600 records, each
having 1000 chars per record, 48 fields, 25 chars per field!

But he MIGHT have 6000 records with much smaller sizes, or a couple of
hundred records with 48 fields, or 3 fields with 250 chars per field.
And available DBMS's won't handle those extremes (at least not to our
knowledge).  That's why the query.

By the way, he and I are discussing "pre-processing" to reduce record
length or numbers of fields or other DBMS-imposed constraints to trim
the filed data down to a swallowable size (in the event an appropriate
DBMS cannot be found for under megabuck range).  (We DO think of the
taxpayer's money, after all!)

Regards, and thanks for the query to keep us on our toes!

TOPS20, for unknown reasons, normally accepts only the following
"standard" characters in file names: uppercase A through Z,
numbers 0 through 9, and the punctuation characters dollarsign
($), hyphen (-), and underscore (_).  Also, when you are creating
or typing filenames, TOPS-20 automatically converts lowercase a
through z to uppercase.

If you want to type any other "nonstandard" character, such as
lowercase a,  circumflex (^) or backslash (\), which appears in
a file name, you must "quote" the character.  The method of
quoting such a character is to type Control-V before you type the
character.  The filename that contains the nonstandard character
also contains a Control-V preceding the character, but TOPS-20
cleverly doesn't show you the Control-V.  (Except sometimes it
does, as "^V"; I can't give you the rule for when.)

Sometimes people include "nonstandard" characters in filenames
deliberately to keep other people from typing them.  I have come
to the conclusion, based on bitter experience, that this is a bad
idea.  I believe, however, that the "nonstandard" characters in
the files in question were standard characters on the machine
from which the files were transferrred.

and someone calls you and you answer it manually on the first ring
(i.e. before the modem would have picked it up)
you will hear the modem come on anyway.
You are trying to talk to the person who called you, and the
modem is busy going "ooooooooooooo" at you both.

It happens in the other direction, too.
If you dial someone with your phone, when they answer
the modem picks up and goes "oooooooo".

Anyone know how to avoid this
(other than unplugging the modem from the phone
line or turning it off)?

I have successfully read and written CP/M-86 disks on a CP/M-80
system, and also on an MP/M-80 system.
The file and directory formats are exactly the same, with one
exception, which is very important.

CP/M-86 has an optional extension to the directory
that allows you to store extra information about each file,
such as date and time stamps, passwords, etc.
This is the same as used in MP/M.
Physically, it uses extra directory entries.
Ordinarily, CP/M-80 uses one directory entry per file,
unless the file is long, in which case it uses additonal
directory entries with the same file name and different status
bits to hold the pointers to the rest of the file.
In MP/M and CP/M-86 you can tell the file system
(using the STAT or SET command) that a particular diskette
will have XFCB's (extended File Control Blocks).
If you do, the OS uses an extra directory entry for 
each file. It has the name of the file and certain status bits
to show it is an XFCB. In the rest of the directory entry,
(where you would ordinarily find pointers to disk blocks)
are the time stamps, etc.
There is also one more special directory entry
which can store the name of the diskette and
its attributes (e.g. whether to have XFCB's, whether
to timestamp all files, etc.)

The result is that MP/M, CP/M-86, and Concurrent CP/M-86 disks
are "upward compatible" from CP/M-80.
The three newer operating systems can read and write
CP/M-80 disks, because to them the disks look like disks
that have not been labelled and have not had the extended
features activated.
But, the CP/M-80 system may get confused when
it reads and writes the disks from the other three.
As long as the diskette does NOT have the extra stuff
activated (which is usually, but not always, the way the
format program leaves a blank disk), CP/M-80 is happy.
But if it tries to use a disk with the extended stuff
activated, it may mess up.
The new version of CP/M-80, called
CP/M-Plus or CP/M 3.0, has these extended
file things.

All clear?
Boy, I hope I got this all right...

While the disk formats, i.e 8", sssd, 128 byte/sector, can be used by
both cp/m-80 and cp/m-86, they have different directory structures. I
don't know the specifics, but I think '86 keeps the date of the last
file modification with the directory entry. 
	If you can figure out the directory format for '86, you should 
be able to read & write with DUU; but it would probably be exasperating.
It seems to me that a conversion program could be built by around duu --
any takers?

I have had the following problem; I have an 8085 in my CP/M system,
and I want ot run some z-80 only software on it.  I have the following
solution: disassemble the z-80 software using a disassembler like REZ,
and reassemble it with a macro assembler like MAC or RMAC that has
macro libraries to simulate Z-80 instructions.  Will this work?  I
have learned many things from my net inquiries on REZ and RESOURCE,
but I feel a need to know the following (in addition to any general
comments on my scheme.)

	REZ will produce good tdl mnemonics when disassembling a 
	z-80 program.  Will REZ run on an 8080?

	Is RMAC capable of producing absoulte output, or will only
	MAC do that?

	What differentiates the RMAC and M-80 assemblers from each other?

	Is there a better disassembler/assembler combinaiton that will
	do what I want?

	What kind of difficulties should I expect if I just do this
	translation mechanically?

	 C. Itoh Prowriter 8510A
	 Tymac parallel interface

It seems that Wordstar's resident underlining command produces text with
the toes cut off (bottom of the characters get's overstruck).  The
Prowriters underline command (codes $1B58 and $1B59) produces proper
underlining, but ignores the left margin setting, sending the printhead
to the leftmost position.  Is there a way to fix this?

We here in XVIII Abn Corps have been hauling good old Corvus 20 Meggers around
for quite a while now.  We make sure the heads are parked, stuff it in a nice
stiff foam padded chest a company made for us (kind of like rock bands use --
nice tough things with black plastic sheet outside, steel edging and corners,
fancy latches, carrying handles -- cost a couple hundred apiece, unfortunately.

We've sent them right through commercial airline baggage handling, seen them
come down the chutes to the big turning devices upside down, sideways, end
over end.  Always seem to come through OK.  Never minded upside down, sideways.
Shipped them strapped to military aircraft pallets, under, on, upside down,
whatever way they'd fit to make the pallet square -- always came through OK.
Hauled them in the backs of jeeps, trucks, up dirt roads and through woods...
came through OK.  Main thing was cushioning the horrible sharp raps and jolts
that shatter logic boards and knock things really loose.  Normal jolts never
seem to bother them.

That's with the Corvus 20Megger now -- donno about yours.

Bob, it sounded to me as if you might be thinking about updating

hold on the program I would like to encourage you to do just that.  
However, I would like to see as many of the known problems fixed as 
possible at the same time.  Toward that end, I am including a 
collection of some "bug" reports (some not really bugs, just annoying 
things).  I hope others on this mailing list will send you notes (with 
copies to INFO-MODEM7@MC) about any other problems they have 
encountered.

Re:   MDM7 bugs?

Two things that I've found in MDM7xx that I consider to be bugs:

1. Program hangs with CPM option when there is modem input

2. Program will not pass control characters to console that are 
   necessary to run a video editor remotely, etc.

Are these known "bugs," or am I the only one having these problems? 
I'm using standard MDM712 with SmartModem overlay and no special 
modifications.

[NOTE FROM KEITH: It should be made clearer in the DOC file that the 
overlay must be configured to allow control characters from the modem 
to reach the console.  Irv set all the overlays to "filter" unwanted 
control characters, apparently thinking that most people don't use the 
terminal mode with video-oriented text editors.  Also the "gathering 
of available characters" from the modem should not be allowed to occur 
when the CPM command is given.  The reason is that if the carrier is 
gone at this time (typical after completing a call) some I/O ports 
seem to lock up when DCD (Data Carrier Detect) goes false.  I believe 
this is the cause of the lock-up condition that happens to some people 
(me included, on the system at work) under these conditions.]

Re:   MDM712

The problems you're having with MDM712 are not peculiar to your 
system.  MDM7xx will hang in a CPM command if there is data coming 
from the modem, but will drop to CPM shortly after the last character 
has been sent.  I'll look at the source if I can make time and figure 
out what it's doing.  Regarding the control characters you can't get 
to the terminal, there is a label IGNORCTL in the front end of the 
main pgm (and in the overlays) that will kill sending of control 
characters above ^M in terminal mode if it is set 'YES', which it is 
in these files.  Maybe that's the problem??
 
My system is an H89 w/ZCPR2 and CP/M 2.2 and I'm getting the same 
things you describe.  Walt Jung has mentioned similar problems with 
the CPM function of MDM712.

Re:   MDM714 terminal mode problems

MDM714 works fine except I got a bug in the LOCMSG  character (the one 
that I think lets you send a local command like ^E in HERMES) while 
telling MDM714 to ignore it.   For some reason the SHFTYPE procedure 
is NOT changing that character back to ASCII in the menu, and ^^ (per 
the original code) does weird things on my Freedom 100 screen!  
Changed it to ^\, so it no longer blows my menu away, but still don't 
have it working quite right.  I'll figure it out though.

Re:   Security of ALDS code with MDM714

MDM714 (and its predecessors) displays the alternate LD (Sprint, etc.) 
number and code on the screen when dialing [which could be a security 
problem if there are others near the terminal].  A simple fix is to 
comment out the 'CALL TYPE' instruction in MDM714.ASM after DIALAD2: 
and add three (3) NOP instructions after it (to keep the code the same 
length).

NetLandians,

I've been (grudgingly) trying to get the hang of Pascal, and have been playing
with my JRT Pascal 3.0 (yeah, yeah, I know -- no flames, please.)

Surprise, surprise:  NO Random.  Looked through my five reference books on
Pascal -- NO Random.  A friend tells me (and source code for a program also
contains it) that Pascal/MT+ does have it, but that's no help.

How, pray tell, can you do the usual Random(n) thing in Pascal?  I'm looking
for a fairly random series of numbers kind of like in BASIC; you know, the
decimal from .00something to .999something.

Since I haven't exactly figured out how to link Assembler programs into JRT
Pascal yet either, that kind of approach (grabbing a register's contents,
sequencing my way through memory) isn't practical yet (unless someone is
willing to expand on the JRT manual!).

Sure would appreciate the help.  I'm getting right at home in Assembler, but
Pascal is still somewhat foreign to me.

Regards, and thanks in advance.

In fact, Tony Li's a little conservative about CP/M-MP/M-CCP/M media
exchange.  The XFCB's (extended file control blocks) look like files in
nonexistent user areas (above 16).  In fact, though, they're set up so
that if all you use is date/time stamping and the protection attributes,
you won't actually get in trouble.  The second 16 bytes of the XFCB is
reserved for encrypted password, and will be zero if the file is
unpassworded, meaning that the ``file'' won't look as if it's using any
space on the disc, and CP/M-80 won't get confused.

In short, you can exchange discs freely back and forth between CP/M-80
and the newer systems, *provided* that the files are unpassworded, even
if XFCB's are used.

Some of the public domain programs may get confused by the XFCB's, so be
careful.  I know that SAP and DUU work.  SD reports some garbage
information for the additional directory entries.

I have no expereinece on this, but I know that some
manufacturers (computers manufacturers) include a 
"SHIP" program that you are supposed to run before
moving your Winchester. This homes the heads to the
unused track called the "landing area" I think,

Subject: Re:  RANDOM in Pascal
To: ABN.ISCAMS@usc-isid.ARPA, INFO-CPM@brl.ARPA

I have seen a Pascal pseudo-random number generator prrogram.
I uses the well-know techinque of taking a seed number,
multiplying it by a constant, adding another constant, and
using the result as a random integer, and also as the next seed.
The problem is finding the "magic numbers" for the constants.
Someone has figured this out for various word lengths, and
I know a set of constants exists which causes a 16-bit
integer to cycle in a pseudo-random fashion through all 64k
numbers. This is then easily converted into a fraction
between 0 and 1.0.
The algorithm I saw was written up in some sample programs
which came with the Motorola Pascal compiler (produces
6809 code on an IBM 360).
I think the magic numbers are listed in the
"Encyclopedia of Computer Science", edited by Anthony Ralston.
You might also try the ACM collected Algortiithms.

Subject: CP/M-86 and Concurrent CP/M-86 for Zenith Z-100
To: info-cpm@brl.ARPA

Latest word on CP/M-86 family products for the Zenith Z-100.

CP/M-86 has reached at least some Heathkit stores but
is in tight supply because (supposedly) the machines being
sent to the DOD are getting it.

Concurrent CP/M-86, ported under contract to Zenith by some 
West coast software house, was supposed to show up for
Beta-test this week, but hasn't. Maybe another week or so.
Final release would probably not be until (I'm guessing here,
based on how long CP/M-86 took) March, 1984 or after.

I finished Taylor's internal version of CCP/M in October,
but we will be switching over to the Zenith version when 
available. My version has some limitations (no Winchester support), 
screen image not changed when virtual console switches, etc.,
that would limit its usefulness for the average user.
However, the multi-tasking and message-passing work fine
(nothing I could do to mess them up!), and that's what we
needed for our application.

For the record, it took about two months of solid effort
to bring up CCP/M, starting from the BIOS which Zenith had
already written for CP/M-86. This does not count about two
months of of reading the manuals and looking at the
BIOS for ZDOS (Zenith MS-DOS) to learn about Z-100 hardware
and 8086 assembler. During that time I was doing a lot
of other things too.

Zenith will also be releasing MP/M-86 arounfd the
same time as Concurrent.
ZDOS version 2.0 should be available very soon, if it
is not already.

   I have not yet brought up a MDM712/714 on the beast, but I intend to
do so shortly.  I have been using another terminal program of mine which
dials ala D.C. Hayes, and it works fine.

   The way the thing is set up, it responds to pretty much all the D.C.
Hayes commands except most of the "ATSx=y" commands, since they tend to
be a bit on the useless side, with a few exceptions.  So any command
in the form "ATDTnumber" followed by a return will work with the U.S.R.
just fine.

   When/if I get 714 running on it, I will let you know what happens.

Try the following (I use it in JRT Pascal):

function Random(Seed : real): real;

{ Return the next value in a pseudo-random sequence.  The range is
0<=N<1. }

begin
  Seed := (9821.0 * Seed) + 0.211327;
  Seed := Seed - trunc(Seed);
  Random := Seed
end;  {Random}


Initialize the random number generator by giving it a first seed.
(RandNum and StartValue are both real)

  RandNum := Random(StartValue);

Succeeding numbers in the sequence are generated by:

  RandNum := Random(RandNum);


The formula used is:  NextSeed = frac((9821.0 * Seed) + 0.211327)
This is the formula in the HP-41C standard applications library.

To: Info-Kermit@COLUMBIA-20.ARPA
cc: Info-CPM@BRL.ARPA

Announcing a new release of KERMIT-80, which provides file transfer and
terminal emulation for CP/M-80 systems.  This release is version 3.6; it has no
new functionality over version 3.5, but several major bugs have been fixed.
These include:

 Cursor addressing errors fixed for various systems.

 During terminal emulation, some systems (the Kaypro II, for instance) would
  output nulls continuously.  This has been fixed.

Thanks to James Grossen at the University of Tennessee at Knoxville for these
fixes.  Users of CP/M Kermit are encouraged to get the new .HEX files (using
their current versions of Kermit), LOAD them, and try them out.  If you do
this, please let me know which system you tried, whether it worked, and if not,
what went wrong.

The .HEX files are available in KER:CPM*.HEX via anonymous FTP from host
COLUMBIA-20.  The systems supported, and the corresponding files, are:

 CPMAPPLE.HEX	Apple II with Z80 SoftCard, DC Hayes MicroModem II	
 CPMBRAIN.HEX	Intertec SuperBrain
 CPMDMII.HEX	DECmate II with CP/M option
 CPMGENERI.HEX	"Generic" CP/M-80 version 2.x
 CPMHEATH.HEX	Heath/Zenith 89
 CPMKAYPRO.HEX	Kaypro II
 CPMOSBORN.HEX	Osborne 1
 CPMOSI.HEX	Ohio Scientific
 CPMPLUS.HEX	"Generic" CP/M-80 version 3.0 (CP/M Plus)
 CPMRAINBO.HEX	DEC Rainbow-100, CP/M-80 (Z80 side)
 CPMROBIN.HEX	DEC VT180 "Robin"
 CPMTELCON.HEX	Telcon Zorba
 CPMTRS80.HEX	TRS-80 Model II with CP/M
 CPMVECTOR.HEX	Vector Graphics
 CPMZ100.HEX	Heath/Zenith Z100, CP/M-80 (Z80 side)

 CPMBASE.M80	The single source file for all the above.
 CPMBASE.DIF	Source differences from version 3.5.

There are also various associated .DOC and .HLP files.

KERMIT implementations are also available for many other systems, both micros
and mainframes.  To get an idea of what's available, see the file
KER:00README.TXT.

Those of you who have been using KERMIT-80 version 3.2 or earlier are
encouraged to try out this new release -- in incorporates many new features,
including built-in DIR and ERA commands, a way for switching and logging in
disks, improved wildcard facilities, etc.

Since we do not have examples at Columbia of more than a couple of the systems
listed above, I would be very grateful to anyone who could report to me about
their success or lack thereof in running this new version of KERMIT-80.
In the meantime, an entirely new (and radically different) release of KERMIT-80
is in preparation.  It is expected that this new version will require
considerable testing, so it is very desirable to stabilize the present version.
Your reports will be of great help in doing this.

Subject: Xerox hardware support for Osborne Computers
From: chris@rand-unix


After Osborne filed for limited bankruptcy in September, Xerox picked
up the service vacuum, and those of us with Osbornes breathed a little
easier, knowing that somebody out there would fix the machines when
they blipped.

Well, Xerox will, but they extort the last drop of blood while they
do it.

My friend has an Osborne with the double-density upgrade.  In June, just
after the warranty on his double density upgrad ran out he had the logic
board and the power supply for about $350, including labor. [Moral 1: don't
get upgrades unless you know somebody who builds comuters and will fix it
for you.  My Osborne with its pokey drives has never been sick since it
came out of warrenty 18 months ago].  Two weeks ago his Osborne developed a
sick logic board, which manifested itself by spinning both screaming disks
and filling the CRT with snow immediately upon power-up.  He took it into
Xerox and requested that they let him know if it would cost more than $350.
Several days later he called to see what was happening, and was told the
work had been completed and it would cost $500: $50 in labor and $419 for
the logic board, plus tax.  This was over twice what the logic board cost
when it was replaced six months ago by Osborne.  It is not clear whether
Xerox has upped the price because it is the only game in town, or whether
the supplier is trying to recover losses.

Moreover, in order to get a service contract from Xerox, one must pay
a $35 inspection fee which is non-applicable to the $285/single year
maintenance fee if the computer passes the inspection.  They will no
longer offer the 2-year contract advertised recently.

Moral 2:  If you take a computer into Xerox and want an estimate,
better get it in writing that they agree to call you before performing
the work.

Moral 3: [Sigh] If you get a chance to pick up an Osborne cheap (and they
are going for less than $1000 with everything thrown in) think twice
about it.  Maintenance may double the cost of your machine.  Which is
too bad, because in many ways, the Osborne is a good computer.

Moral 4:  If you want to make a fortune these days, skip law school,
don't go into medicine, and don't wait to be discovered as a rock
star.  Just open a computer repair shop.

Bob (et al)

Don't think the traffic/messages actually stated the Z100 was "the official
DoD micro" as such - but that one big joint-service, "everybody join in if
you wanna" type specification and contract was let.  I think someone
mentioned maybe 250 machines at last count, but this is an "F6" bit of
info (for you MI types).  I hope my original source has some more current
information, since I am MOST information in anything I can use as strong
evidence that SOMEONE out there is trying to standardize!  (Lord, what a
grabbag we have here!)

I recently heard USAF wanting to transport some Pascal stuff from another
micro over to the Z100 (one little Agency), but still have no firm evidence
that they are proliferating all over the Services.  Do know Navy bought
a bunch (hundred?) of other small one-board CP/M micros down Louisiana way,
so nothing really locked in yet on the Z100.

I have purchased the 2500AD Z-80 Assembler and found it to be useless
for the following reasons:
1)It does not generate a PRN file, but will list the output to the printer.
  This is bad since it wastes a lot of paper and time on printouts that 
  you don't need.
2)It does not generate any type of symbols table file, and therefore will
  not work with ZSID. Also, 2500AD does not provide a replacement for ZSID,
  to be used with their assembler. A good debugger is necessary for assembly
  language program development.
3)The relocatble code output from their assembler is NOT Microsoft format,
  and therefore will NOT work with other software tools (such as the 
  PLINK-II linker/loader). This also means that you can not link their
  assembler output to such programs as BDS-C or any of the Microsoft
  languauges.

	My recommendation is to purchase the Microsoft Macro-80 and Link-80
assembler. It is an excellent Z-80 assembler, and will also assembler 8080
code.
	If there is further interest I will post excerpts from their
	manual.

In fact, Tony Li's a little conservative about CP/M-MP/M-CCP/M media
exchange.  The XFCB's (extended file control blocks) look like files in
nonexistent user areas (above 16).  In fact, though, they're set up so
that if all you use is date/time stamping and the protection attributes,
you won't actually get in trouble.  The second 16 bytes of the XFCB is
reserved for encrypted password, and will be zero if the file is
unpassworded, meaning that the ``file'' won't look as if it's using any
space on the disc, and CP/M-80 won't get confused.

In short, you can exchange discs freely back and forth between CP/M-80
and the newer systems, *provided* that the files are unpassworded, even
if XFCB's are used.

Some of the public domain programs may get confused by the XFCB's, so be
careful.  I know that SAP and DUU work.  SD reports some garbage
information for the additional directory entries.

Message-ID: <[USC-ECLB]14-Dec-83 15:32:48.JHESS>

Two pieces of paper have crossed my desk this week concerning the
Zenith Z-100:

1.  Air Force Systems Command (ACDT) letter, dated 8 Nov 1983, 
subject: Information, Small Computer Contract states in part:

     "1.  This letter is intended for information only and should not be
      construed as a solicitation for requirements..  The Air Force standard
      small computer contract was awarded to Zenith Data Systems on 3 Oct 83.
      It becomes a mandatory source for microcomputers, although if sufficient
      justification exists, other sources are allowed.

      2.  Since this equipment is managed under the 300-Series regulations,
      the DAR process, via AFSC Form 380, is mandatory ..."

2.  An undated and unsigned paper entitled " Z-100 Contract Guidelines and
Items of Interest" states:

      "1.  Air Force policy is:  If the products on this contract can
       satisfy the user's requirement, we must use this contract."

      "4.  Zenith plans to offer the following packages with an amendment
       to the contract:
         a.  Multiplan (spreadsheet)
         b.  Lotus 1-2-3 (INTEGRATED SPREADSHEET, dbms, AND graphics)
         c.  Concurrent CP/M
         d.  Wordstar (word processing)
         e.  "C" compiler"

      "9.  AFSCOASO and AFLANSPO are jointly developing communications
       interface software."

      "10.  Government employees, including military, may acquire a Z-100
       microcomputer, peripherals, and related software by joining the
       Government Employees Association, GEA, for a modest fee of $10.  This
       lifetime membership allows an employee to buy products at the same
       price as the Government contract.  The employee is limited to one
       system per year and a maximum of $5000.00 total purchases on this 
       contract.  The buyer must pay shipping cost and the equipment must
       be shipped to the buyer's home address."

NOTE - The contract number is "F19630-83-D-0005" and the purchase prices
are fantastic --- approx 40-60% off list.  The Navy apparently has some 
joint arrangement with the Air Force, but I have not been able to get any
details.  I don't bthink the Army has a piece of the action.  I called
GEA yesterday and they confirmed the info in the notice quoted above.  They
are sending me additional info and I will post the net when I receive it.

Subject:  MDM715 now available

Tom Bering has just released MDM715, the latest version of MODEM7.
Below is a complete history of the updates of MDM7xx so readers
can see the significant changes that have occured recently.  An
announcement of the files available from SIMTEL20 will be made in
a separate message.

MDM715 supports Auto-Dialing and automatic continuous redialing for
the following modems:

                a)  PMMI 103 plug-in S-100 modem
                b)  Hayes Smartmodem 300 or 1200
                c)  U.S. Robotics 300/1200 modem

12/11/83  Expanded Hayes redial options. Eliminated scrolling
          of CRT display during redial. Added clue to abort CAL.
          Eliminated duplicate 'CONNECT' msg on CRT (from Hayes).
          Eliminated display of ALT LD access codes. Faster redial
MDM715    for Hayes. Resets Hayes (ATZ) on BYE command. Finished
          clean-up of comments missed by NEAT. Shortened 3 LTR
          command help screen by one line. New NUMBLIB ORG 0D00.
                                        - Tom Bering

11/11/83  Releasing full source code, including all comments. Updated
          the telephone library for currently available RCPM systems.
MDM714    LF not automatically added in "L" half duplex mode now. Can
          be added via "TLF" command if needed. Renamed the overlays
          to allow them to remain independent of further updates.
          Example: M7AP-1.ASM, M7GP-1.ASM, M7PC-1.ASM, etc. Enjoy
                                        - Irv Hoff

10/10/83  Fixed old PMMI bug - changed line in NXTOPT0 area which now
          reads STA CMDBUF+4 (was +5). This caused the PMMI modem to
MDM713    flip to answer mode whenever 'CAL' (auto-dial) function was
          used. This bug had been around for some time and led to
          notices of 'flakey operation' in earlier MODEM7xx programs.
          Did some cleanup.             - Sigi Kluger

08/01/83  Added two alternate dialing routines such as MCI and SPRINT.
          Slight change in batch transfer area.  Prevented CTL-Y and
MDM712    CTL-R from outputting to the modem while saving for disk.
          Fixed "disk space remaining" to read correctly with CP/M+.
          Renamed all overlays to conform with 6-character filename
          limit on Compuserve.  - Irv Hoff

07/01/83  Changed TERM to allow use of printer port for modem use.
          Needed by the Morrow MD and NEC 8001 computers.  Changed all
MDM711    overlays to allow overprinting the PMMI parity routines as
          the Applecat overlay was not working properly.  Removed the
          short break tone during disconnect as Smartmodem 1200 were
          locking up.  (Smartmodem 300 were operating normally.)
                                        - Irv Hoff

06/17/83  At last.  Program now has autodialing and auto-continuous
          redialing for Hayes Smartmodem 300 or 1200, PMMI 103 modem
MDM710    or U.S.Robotics.  After first unsuccessful try, asks if you
          want to quit, try once again, or continuously redial.  Also
          changed the BYE routine to be compatible with systems other
          than RCP/M.  Now trap 87H and 7H which are sometimes used by
          mainframes to signify "do not send any more sectors at this
          time".  This keeps the original Christensen protocol when
          ACKNAK is set YES.  (ACKNAK can of course be set to NO if
          the results seem preferable to the user.  Some problems have
          been noticed in batch transfers and modem-to-modem use with
          ACKNAK set NO.)               - Irv Hoff

05/27/83  Corrected a phone number in the library.  Added a CR/LF for
          the quiet mode if using batch transfer.  Simplified initial-
MDM709    ization at startup.  Two minor mods to assist in adding an
          overlay for Hayes 300/1200 SmartModem later.
                                        - Irv Hoff

05/15/83  Extensive revisions on many parts of the program.  Relocated
          most of the PMMI routines near the start to facilitate using
MDM708    the new 300/1200 PMMI board or the Hayes Smartmodem.  Some
          of the more ambitious changes include:
             a) CRC system replaced with the high-speed lookup tables
                similar to those used in CHEK15.
             b) Separate printer buffer.  Can now print regardless of
                input speed even when saving for a disk file.
             c) Printer buffer and disk buffer each can accept up to
                128 characters after an X-OFF to compensate for line-
                oriented systems and satellite linking.
             d) Saving to disk made far more user-friendly.  'NOL' no
                longer used.  File automatically closed upon exit.
             e) Sector count shown before "ACK" is sent, allowing
                high-speed transfers (to 19,200 baud) without errors.
             f) Typing BYE on command line or CTL-D in terminal mode
                disconnects and returns to CP/M.  Also closes any disk
                files that may be open.  "X" (secondary option) does
                the same thing, allowing automatic terminate at com-
                pletion of file transfer.
             g) Improved the "E" (echo) mode, also half duplex mode.
             h) Control characters above ^M not passed to the CRT, an
                optional feature.
             i) Handling of command line options greatly modernized.
             j) For PMMI users, program automatically comes up in
                originate mode at default speed.  No need to ever say
                TO.300 unless a baudrate change is desired.
             k) Simlified and changed numerous flags to be consistent
                with others.
             l) Several improvements in error handling and detection.
          Numerous other changes.  We attempted to incorporate all the
          suggestions forwarded from various users in addition to some
          features I wanted myself.   - Irv Hoff

01/01/83  First version.  Can be assembled with ASM.COM.  MDM700 was
          selected to commence a new series of version numbers.  This
MDM700    can be readily used on data bank systems that limit file
          names to a total of 6 characters.
                                        - Irv Hoff

       To adapt this version to your equipment, you will want to get
some of these programs.  The minimum would be any pair in one of the
examples shown below.)

       There are two ways by which you can set the proper ports,
status pin values, etc. for your equipment.

     1) Use your editor, ASM (or MAC) MDM715.COM and DDT (or SID)
with: M7xx-x.ASM (7xx-x stands for an appropriate overlay)

     2) Use your editor, ASM (or MAC)  MDM715.ASM

Since no customization is required in the main program, it is recommended
that you use #1.

The program is designed to work immediately for PMMI users with no
changes - just use MDM715.COM.  (You might wish to change some of the
available options, however.  It is set to use base port 0C0H.)

When you're ready to use the program, type 'H' (for 'HELP'), hit RET
and it will display helpful information on the commands.  There are so
many commands there are several pages.  You can abort the display with
a CTL-C.  (One of the most useful features being CTL-P to toggle your
printer on/off.)  You can also type a question mark (?) which shows the
current parameters.

I realize this is a little late to get in MODEM715, but I am not
sure if this is a bug or not. I am now running 712, and
ocassionally need to use the ^@ key to send a break.
This is only needed on one system that answers with Bell 212
protocol but at 300 baud, so I have to send breaks to get
a baud-rate change.

Using a Hayes Smartmodem, which has lights to show when a 
character is sent, the light only flashes every SECOND time
^@ is pushed, implying that the break is only sent on
every second request. The problem is that the baud-rate
changer is so flaky I can't be sure if breaks are really going
out or not. 

Has anyone else seen something like this?
Does anyone ever send breaks?

     Some traffic has recently passed here about the possibility of
purchasing the Zenith Data Systems Z-120 computer through the Govenrment
Employees' Association at substantial savings.   This is correct!  Since
the Air Force and Navy contracted with Zenith to provide a minimum of
6,000 of these units, the GEA has been selected as the vehicle to make
the very same items available to any government employee (federal,
state, or local) by making application to the GEA, along with a one-time
$10 membership fee.
     Anyone can write to the GEA at:
          Government Employees' Association, Inc.
          P.O. Box 2405
          Arlington, VA  22202 or phone them at:  (703) 920-5800 and
receive the complete Zenith ordering package.
     Here are a few examples of the items offered and their cost:

ZFG-121-32      Z-120 computer with dual disk drives, 192K memory.
                includes: CP/M-85, BASIC-80, diagnostic software,
                technical reference manual, 10 floppy disks.
                $1,799.00

ZWG-121-32      Same as above except one of the two floppy drives
                is replaced with a 10MB Winchester.
                $2,799.00

ZVM-135         13" RGB and composite color monitor with cable.
                $360.00

Z-205           256K memory expansion board.
                $379.00

HMS-837-4       BASIC compiler (8-bit)
                $40.00

HCD-8937-1      CONDOR 8-bit DBMS.
                $110.00

CD-463-1        CONDOR 16-bit DBMS
                $50.00

     There are numerous other items (three pages worth) available.  For
complete details, contact the GEA.  I sent my order in on Monday, the
12th of December.  I will keep the net informed as to the progress of
that order so that you may have some idea of the timelines involved.
     On a final note ... I heard that Zenith will make these prices
available to any non-profit group (clubs, schools, etc.) that purchase
at least 25 computers.  This has not been verified.

Digital Equipment's Raibow also were among the finalists but those
computers were bid by system houses."
     "Under the terms of the contract, ZDS, a Zenith Radio Corp.
subsidiary, will supply a minimum of 6,000 microcom- puters over the
next three years, for use by Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps.  The
Zenith microcomputers will communicate with other DOD computer systems."

     The rest of the article described the configuration of the system
and other peripheral/accessory suppliers.
     What this really means is that the Air Force and Navy has decided
that if a unit can otherwise justify a small computer, the one that will
be supplied will be the Z-120.  This does not mean that computers will
automatically be supplied to all offices in DOD.  The main purpose for
this is to maintain as much interoffice compatibility for media and
program format as possible.  The competition was based, by the way, on a
rather extensive list of requirements.  Most of the other suppliers
would have had to get waivers for portions of those requirements.  Only
Zenith's machine fully met them.  (e.g.  5" and 8" capability, S-100,
dual processors).
     There is much more than this, Dave.  I can send you a copy if you
would like it for your files.  I have already sent my personal order in
to the Government Employees' Association.  Watch the net for further
information on this.

Subject:  Overlay files for MDM715

The overlay files distributed with MDM712 and later versions all
work correctly with MDM715.  Sorry I forgot to mention that in
the message announcing the release of MDM715.

Please note that many of the files on SIMTEL20 will soon be, or
have already been renamed to be identical to the names used on
RCPM systems around the country.  The MDM7xx overlays are amoung
those already renamed.  M7PM.1ASM became M7PM-1.ASM, for instance.
In general, if you have trouble finding files in the MICRO:<CPM.whatever>
directories at SIMTEL20, remember that version numbers which were a part
of the "filetype" field have been moved to the "name" field.

Subject:  LTYPE12 bug fix

There is a bug in LTYPE12.ASM/COM which will cause the program
to incorrectly count the maximum number of lines to be typed
and may cause it to bomb under some conditions depending upon
the maximum number of lines selected at address 101h.

BEGIN:	MVI	A,MAXLIN	;max number of lines displayed
	STA	MAXLS-1		;*****<---SHOULD BE MAXLS
	STA	MAXLS1-1	;*****<---SHOULD BE LAXLS1
	LXI	H,0		;save CP/M stack pointer
	DAD	SP
	SHLD	STACK
	LXI	SP,STACK	;set up local stack

You can fix the .COM file without having to reassemble by patching
with DDT:
	Change the byte at 103h from A9 to AA
	Change the byte at 106h from B6 to B7

I have uploaded LTYPE12A.HEX which already has this patch installed.
It's in the SIMTEL20 MICRO:<CPM.CPMLIB> directory.

Re: CP/M Z-80 Assemblers.

	SLR Systems (1622 North Main Street/ Butler Pa/ 16001) makes
a Z-80 assembler/linker set which is really nice.  In addition to being
extremely fast, it is done the way assemblers and linkers ought to
be done- with a lot of emphasis on the linker.  It also gives a lot
of options; with the ability to make one or two assembly passes (with
two you get listings with real numbers in the forward references, with
one you let the linker do the work); it offers Microsoft object format
as well as their own (which they describe in detail, another plus!).

	It has a couple of drawbacks; such as no macro capability and
the fact that it links in memory (so you can't make a .COM file that
exactly fits in memory).  The good news is that these things are in
the works for the next release, so they say.

	They advertise in micro magazines.

Subject: Jade Double-D mod
Article-I.D.: sii.354

I notice there has been some discussion of the Jade Double-D board.  My
brother has the DD and has done some interesting things with it.  He has
added 30K of extra memory on the DD board, and rewritten (and re-PROM'ed)
the DCM (the disc control module which is the control program for the
Z80 onboard the DD) to make use of this 30K as a disc cache.  His new DCM
combines mru (most-recently-used) and rfu (recent-frequently-used)
algorithms to decide which sectors to keep in memory.  The rfu scheme
involves a sliding window of the last 1000 sectors to have been accessed.
This combination of algorithms results pretty much in keeping the desired
things in the cache.  For instance, when he is working on a program,
the steps may involve editing and compiling a program.  With a strictly
mru-based caching algorithm, the source file would appear in the cache
and get replaced by the compiler COM file.  With the recent-frequency
algorithm added, sectors from the source file have higher priority.
The same applies to frequently run programs (e.g. PIP), or an editor,
etc.

I suppose that anybody who is interested in this can mail to me, as
he does not have a usenet account.

Subject: The response on BIOS's I promised.
Cc: info-cpm@brl-vgr


David,
	Here is a response to some of your requests of DEC 8.


2.  Buffered keyboard.  Followed with avid interest a column in Byte where
some brave adventurers were trying it, and they (I think) finally gave up
or found a simplistic solution or something.  Any pointers to articles,
public domain stuff, etc.  (I'm running a Liberty Electronics Freedom 100
terminal, and it won't give me that onboard the terminal alone either.)
RESPONSE:
	I have a BIOS which does just that and it's a very nice feature.
It also gives some meanings to control characters such as sorted directories,
flushing the track buffer, kill input or printer queue, etc. It also has memory
disk, disk track caching, and some stty stuff. Unfortunately it's based on
Ithaca Intersystems version 4h BIOS. If you happen to have access to the beast
I can send you my version without it being a copyright violation.
	I haven't heard of any public domain BIOS's. Do such things exist?

4.  Implementing a (new?) CP/M call (ho, boy - no flames about tampering
with the sacred, please) -- Check Status of Reader and/or Punch.  Reason:
Wanna use that third serial port (1 for terminal, 1 for printer, 1 for modem)
as a fully capable port simultaneously with the other two so I can (a)
relay between two modems, simultaneously print to printer and a bar code
printer, and other daydreams.  And NOT have to write specific software to
check the third port (like I have with MDM714 and KERMIT) - just use STAT
and other common utilities.
RESPONSE:
	To do what you want I think there is a better way. Just modify the ConSt
entry to return the remote status as the high four bits and the console as the
low four. If there is nothing on the remote every thing is ok. If you want to
be really safe, get the source to CP/M and have the BDOS always do an ani 01
in its status call. That way only programs which call the BIOS will see the remote
status. If you want the CP/M source write me and I'll send you the address of the
man who sells it. you might also consider one of the ZCPR's.
	There are other reasons for adding BIOS entry points. I use mine to
enable control interception, and to enable XON/XOFF handshaking on the remote.
What I did was to place 3 distinctive bytes just after the new entry so programs
trying to use it could verify its existance.

5.  Stuff in some more memory.  Who can GUARANTEE a nice fat 256- or
512-Kb memory board (static like I presently have or good dynamic) that'll
work with my buss and CPU board and DMA and all the other Morrow goodies?
RESPONSE:
	I have a Compupro 128K static board and it does everything except talk to
my front panel. I think they also make a 256k board. Guarantee?

6.  Stuff in a 68000 CPU board.  Read wonderful things about Compupro's
board, but all configurations seem to indicate ALL Compupro boards on the
bus (and preferably a Compupro buss too!).  What Morrow stuff would I have
to yank out and replace to make such a wonderful thing happen?  (Would like
to keep the Z80 right where it is for some sort of dual-processor capability.)
RESPONSE:
	Compupro and Morrow are both good boards so they SHOULD talk. You would
have to hack together the two BIOS's.
	If you have any luck running the two processors in the same buss PLEASE
tell me, and maybe the net too, I'ld love to do the same thing but haven't worked
out a way. (I'm really a software type.)

GENERAL:
	There seems to be very little on the net about nice features in BIOS's.
If people have ideas, this might be an interesting topic of discussion.

ELECTRONIC NEWS on 10 Oct 83 reported:

     "Zenith Data Systems last week snagged a 3-year contract valued at
$29.2 million from 16 other competitors, including Burroughs and NCR, to
furnish the Air Force and Navy with microcomputers."
     "Zenith's Z-100 desktop system was selected from over 50
competitors, with the 16 finalists including NCR, with its DecisionMate,
North Star's Advantage, and Burroughs' B20.  IBM's Personal Computer and

From: Doug  <HUNEYCUTT@GUNTER-ADAM>
To: Inof-CPM@BRL-VGR
cc: Huneycutt


I'd like to take some time to quash some rumors that are flying recently
about the Zenith/AF/Navy contract signed on 3 Oct 83.  

  There were 32 proposals evaluated by a huge number of people...technicians,
cost analysts, contract specialists, and such.

  The number was reduced to 15 because of problems with some of the proposals,
like not supporting a mandatory requirement, etc.  All (thats <<ALL>>) of the
remaining 15 met the requirements of our specifications.  There was a wide
range of machines left in evaluations, some technically poor and one that was
far ahead of the rest (technically), with an 8086 instead of 8088, 8MHz 
instead of 5MHz, etc.  They did not win.

  In the same general class at the end were:  1) the Z-100, 2) the PC-XT, 
3) the TI Professional, and a few others.

IT ALL CAME DOWN TO COST, FOLKS!!!!  The Z-100 was the best machine for the
price.  Do you honestly think that the same government that sent men to the
moon in the arms of the lowest bidder would buy anything but the best buy
in computers???

By the way, recent messages about items being added to the contract contain
both good and bad information.  The only advice I can give for possible GEA
(personal) buyers is....DONT ACCEPT RUMORS AS TRUE UNTIL ADVISED BY GEA!

agree them Corvuses are good stuff, although we have never
treated ours QUITE that way.  Eagle Spirit XT hard disk rugged
too.  Kaypro 10 hard disk NOT rugged, becareful of same.

We would like to get in touuch with the authors of Advent 2 as

it compiles itself.

it is not fast, but not too slow either.

it is useful, but for production work in CP/M systems I would
prefer MT+ or Modula-2.  However, if the objective is to get
familiar with Ada, Janus is the best of the micro
implementations, and ain't bad as something to write reasonable
programs in (if you consider ada reasonable to begin with).

The main items (on 5-1/4" drives) to watch out for are:

1. Write a program that moves the heads to the recommended "landing zone"
   before you shut it off. If you don't know where that is, try the very
   last (highest #) cylinder.

2. Pack it VERY well in THICK foam, so the heads don't bounce.

3. Keep it VERY clean, and wait a few hours after flying with it to
   let it warm up from the chill of the luggage compartment. The cleaniness
   is because air will vent in and out through the filter as the plane goes
   down and up, and the cleaner the area around the breather holes (near the
   spindle), the less chance of some dust sneaking into the "clean room".

4. It you are carrying a bare drive, make very sure that nothing can touch
   or bounce into the actuator arm (the end of the head positioner stepping
   motor on the side of the drive). Use even more foam.

That's all! Have fun.

Cc: info-cpm@BRL.ARPA

The generic version of CCPM I used at Taylor was version 2.0.
For comparison, the one that DRI sells already configured for
the IBM PC is based on version 1.x.
I am pretty sure (just about certain) that the
Zenith CCPM will also be based on version 2, not
on the version 3 that J. Pournelle mentions.

The main features of CCPM 2 vs. 1 are:
     Operating system is smaller.
     Programs with >64K code now load properly, i.e. you
         do not have to use the "R" command that comes with the
         DRI C compiler to get them to run.

Since Zenith supports MS-DOS as ZDOS, I presume they will eventually
release a CCPM that runs MS-DOS programs, but not in the initial
release. If the DRI IBM version is out in February, I would guess
the generic version 3 would be available to other vendors around then
or some time after.

More news as it becomes available....

1)  Does it support floating point?
2)  Documentation?  (Is it two or three pages of photocopy or something

3)  Bugs?  How about bug-fix support?
4)  Update policy?  (Gotta be a way to get the bug-fixes..)

     I will copy responses back to the net if the interest is there..

Your best bet, from my experience, is Pascal/MT+ (86), from
Digital Research, Inc. (Pacific Grove).  They have recently
ported it to PC-DOS, and will soon go to the popular UNIXes.
It of course works under CP/M-86, MP/M-86 and Concurrent CP/M.
Therefore, you are guaranteed of a very wide coverage for
your programs, if portability is important to you.

Pascal/MT+ has been around for quite a while and is a solid
product.  Code generation is excellent and I understand that
DRI is improving it even more by producing a new generation
of compilers that will share a common code-generator and
run-time library.  This will ensure rapid support of new CPUs
and new or improved operating systems.

If you've read the December issue of Dr. Dobb's Journal, you know that
Dysan is (has been) marketing a Digital Diagnostic Diskette (DDD).  To
go along with this, there is a public domain program, DDD11.ASM, which
utilizes this diskette to provide a test system for floppy drives.
Well, I just got my diskette; but the program listed in the Journal is
somewhat abbreviated, so I'm looking for the *real thing.*  Does
anyone have the full DDD11.ASM?  (Note that the original Dysan program
released was DDD10.ASM, so I *don't* want that; even the abbreviated
program is better, thanks.) Eventually, I want to re-write the program
in 'C' (as much as possible) for portability, and re-post it.

I'll be somewhat out of touch for a couple of weeks (Houston till the

Don,

Maybe I miss the point to your question.  Doesn't STAT give you that answer?
And don't several different fancy-format directory programs show the amount
of space used by files, and amount remaining?  Or is it a different sort of
space available/free you're talking about.

Has anyone have any evaluations of OCCAM or the Transputer??
OCCAM is a process-oriented language (see 30 November 1983
Electronics pp. 89+ for article) designed to easily develop
concurent processing systems.  There are evaluation kits for
Apple, IBM-PC, ... using the SCUD p-System...  Anyone tried
one of these?

The Transputer is a computer architecture from Inmos which
is designed for multi-processor concurrent systems advertising
a 32 bit 10 mips cpu and is supposed to be extremely good for
OCCAM.  Has anyone got any concrete information (other than the
really nice glossy stuff from Inmos?

I have a need to bypass the BDOS of CP/M-86 on an IBM-PC and call the
BIOS directly.  I am aware of the BDOS function to perform a 'pass
through', but timing is critical in this application.  Either I am
missing it in the DRI manual, or it never actually tells you how to 
call the BIOS (probably under the 'the less they know, the less they
can do wrong' theory).  

Information?

Although I have'nt used VRTX I have heard good things about it and it has
been out for some time so the chances that they have alot of users are good
and it probably is robust. When I inquired about it the price was a little
high for my tastes (in January it is going up in price ~$5000 for z80 version).
And for orders of less than 100 about $50 licensing fee for each unit the OS
is running in. Another possibility is MTOS. About the same initial price but
no licensing fee and source for the entire OS is given. I got a complete manual
set from the manufacturer and it looks quite good. It does support multiple
processors for the 8085, 68000, 8086 versions also.

Finding the free space on disk under CCP/M is simple.  CP/M isn't so
simple.

Under CCP/M, you can use the BDOS call DRV_SPACE (46 - 02eH).  Input
argument is a drive number.  Result is the first three bytes in the
DMA buffer.  The bytes contain the number of free sectors on the disk.
The bytes are stored with least significant byte first (Sigh).

Under CP/M (I think - it's been a while), you can get the address of
the allocation vector if the disk is not read/only.  This is done via
the DRV_ALLOCVEC (27 - 01bH) BDOS call.  The allocation vector is a
bit messy.  Probably the best way to look at it is the drawing by
Harvey Deitel in his book @b(An Intorduction to Operating Systems).
On page 550, he gives a good discussion of the allocation vector.  Of
course, if you have manuals, this is even better.

The documentation is a full (100+, probably closer to 150 pages) BOOK
	which serves both as a TurboPascal guide and a Pascal reference.

It does support floating point.  Or so the doc says, I haven't needed that
	feature yet, but is supposed to be 14-digit precision.

I pulled one of my existing 36k source files, and compiled WITH NO ERRORS,
	on the first pass (to disk: one of the compile modes. other is
	in memory, ready to run or debug.)

I have no personal stake in BI, but the software I got from them I consider
	an admirable way to be in business.

PS.	Mod to comment #3.  Had to change some of the pointer manipulation

PPS.	identifiers can be <= 128 (I think) characters long.  Suffice it
	to say that I used a VMS Pascal source to test, and had no problems

Subject: DRI C Compiler Update
To: info-cpm@brl.ARPA


Here is the latest on the Digital Research C Compiler for CP/M-86.
We have been using the 2nd release of the complier since October.
It works pretty well, except for the floating point!
Floating-point I/O is all messed up. You try to read a
number and get back a zero, for example.
Printing is uncertain, and so is integer<->float conversion.
The Taylor people wound up writing conversion and I/O routines
to work temporarily.

A letter arrived last week saying that version 1.1 would be shipped
in Mid-December. This fixes all the bugs, they say.
It was also used to implement the C and Fortran compilers, so is
supposedly well tested.

This release is the first that uses the front-end/back-end concept.
The Fortran and C compilers share the same code generator (back-end)
but have a different parser (front-end).
On other machines (e.g. 68000), the compilers use the same front
end oas on the 8086, but share a new back-end.

More information when the new compiler arrives!

Incidentally, before people write to me and say
"why didn't you use another compiler?"
we needed one that could access more than 64K  of data and
would run under Concurrent CP/M.
We couldn't wait for the multi-tasking version of MS-DOS,
which is not available yet, or for the Lattice or CI versions of C
which are not out for CP/M with extended data.
If you know of one that meets these requirements, let me know.

    Subject: Computing free space on a disk
    There  comes  a  time  when I would like to know how much
    free space remains on a  disk  in  a  CP/M  system.   The
    question  is:  how do I find out?  One way is to scan the
    file directory, keeping a running count of sectors  used,
    and subtract that sum from the total available.  Is there
    an easier way?


If I understand correctly (i.e., you want to include a routine in
a  file  that  checks  remaining  disk space), what you need is a
combination of data from BDOS Functions 27 and 31.  #27 points to
the  disk  map, where there is a string of bits (not bytes,   tho
of course grouped into bytes) that say if a block on a disk is in
use or not.  Function 31 tells you other data you need about your
disk, e.g., density, sectors per track, etc.

Then you need to combine these into a program segment that counts
the empty blocks, multiplies  by  their  size,  and  reports  the
result.   There  is  a  fine  example by M. Karas in November '82
LIFELINES.

Using that example, plus the superb description of BDOS functions
in Johnson-Laird's THE PROGRAMMERS CP/M HANDBOOK, I was  able  to
write  a  routine  for my favorite editor that pretty well solves
the problem of a full disk when  saving  a  file.     My  routine
checks  remaining  disk space,  checks the size of the file being
loaded into the editor, the size of the BAK file  (if  any),  and
then  calculates how much space will remain after deletion of the
old BAK file, creating of the new BAK file,  and  saving  of  the
edited file.  If that value is less than 20k, the editor warns me
and allows me to abort right then.  If the value is less than 4k,
the editor will not let me load the file at all.  (I mention this
just to show that the Karas routine works and is very useful.)

Good luck.  If I can help more, let me know.

the problem of a full disk when  saving  a  file.     My  routine
checks  remaining  disk space,  checks the size of the file being
loaded into the editor, the size of the BAK file  (if  any),  and
then  calculates how much space will remain after deletion of the
old BAK file, creating of the new BAK file,  and  saving  of  the
edited file.  If that value is less than 20k, the editor warns me
and allows me to abort right then.  If the value is less than 4k,
the editor will not let me load the file at all.  (I mention this
just to show that the Karas routine works and is very useful.)

Good luck.  If I can help more, let me know.

NetLandians,

One of our members out there queried me about a comment referencing CPMUSER,
a CP/M patch that shows you the user area with the usual CP/M Disk and Prompt
("A>") symbols.  I foolishly erased his message (got #'s mixed up), and don't
know who to reply to.

For that one person (and others interested), there's an article in my
directory (ABN.ISCAMS@USC-ISID) you are welcome to FTP.  It has various
explanations on my mods and discoveries in CP/M, specifically the CBIOS&
provided for the Morrow Decision I, plus my implementation of two Public
Domain patches:  the CPMUSER one mentioned above, and a second which forces
CP/M to look first to Disk A Same User Area if it can't find a file, and
then to Disk A User Area 0.

For Decision I owners, there's other goodies about the mystical Multi I/O
board, AutoStart, and other things.  Morrow owners, please feel free to
contact me on a bunch of Morrow-specific stuff I've developed (mostly
adaptations of good Public Domain things) that handle the peculiar port
switching in our system.  I have KERMIT running (the very latest mod);
also an improvement to MDM715 with the MM overlay plus my own stuff; Freedom
100 Terminal control stuff; a parity patch for your BIOS if you just HAVE to
fiddle with parity to your ports; an automatic initialization of your serial
port (for a modem) to 1200 so no more BAUD commands.  AND I got that stupid
Morrow clock software to work (don't ask ME why they put in two lousy
instructions that ASM won't assemble, when pure and simple 8080 instructions
do EXACTLY the same thing!)  Am presently trying to stick in some other disk
drivers for 5 1/4 floppies, but not there yet (don't want to use the NorthStar
drivers that came with it).

Regards,....Oooooh, yeah - the name of the article (dummmb):  TOADBIOS.DOC.1
Not TOO long.

x <- destroy all monsters

The easiest way to calculate the available space on a disk is to use the
allocation map - the bits turned off in the allocation map are available
allocation groups, so you just multiply the number of bits off by the
allocation size (available from factors in the disk parameter block) and
that is the room left on the disk.  You can get pointers to the disk
block from the BDOS, then use that to find the allocation vector,
maximum number of groups, and the allocation size.  See the DRI
incomprehensible manuals for the exact details, or take apart the code
in one of the public domain directory programs (like SD).

Note that using the DPB information makes the program relatively
independent of what hardware configuration its running on.

Subject: Determining free disk space
Article-I.D.: aplvax.462

One of these days I'll learn to state my question clearly.  I asked
for a way to determine how much free space is available on a disk
in a CP/M environment.  Several nice people resonded with STAT.COM,
XDIR.COM, etc.  Ah, they were right, but I had meant to ask something 
different.  

I want to determine free disk space from the confines of an application
program -- through a BDOS call, or some other portable method.  So
when my programs are going to write to disk, they can first check
if enough space if available.  One of the major flaws of CP/M is that
when things start to go wrong...you're done for.  I would like to avoid
that if all possible.  I could read every directory entry and determine
through some simple mathematics how much space is available, but I would
prefer something more elegant.

what the difference between the h-100, 110 and 120?  i'll tell you.
the h-100 is the "generic" series number.  the is actually no
h-100 that i know of.  the h-110 is the low profile model (no built-in
screen) while the h-120 is the high profile model (built-in screen).

this info can be obtained from looking at the part numbers in a
heath catalog.

I am having some trouble with the SYSCOPY (version 1.0) utility written
by Stephen M.  Kenton.  I am using an Apple //, with Microsoft Softcard
(CP/M 2.20B) and standard Apple drives.  When I use the DU utility, I
can ask for track zero, sector one and I get what appears to be T0S1,
with copyright notice, etc.  With DU, T0S2 shows all 0FFH bytes.
However, in SYSCOPY, it seems to skip the T0S1 and puts the T0S2 sector
into system[0][], then the remaining sectors in sequence from there.
I.e., the first sector never gets read and the following sectors get
slid up by one sector.  Does anyone have any ideas on this?  Thanks.

(NetLandians, just to let you know Ed found me, and in case you wonder about
those strange returns also...)

Ed, your message DID get to me at ABN.ISCAMS.  What appears to happen with
returns from strange places YOU never addressed a message to is:

Someone (a net, someone) redistributes a message out in other directions,
and if someone in THAT direction (like another net) can't receive your
message, an error comes back to YOU, the originator.  The redirection
software assumes the originator wants to know, I guess.  I'm ALWAYS getting
stuff from the Daemon Mailer and other net handlers (all automated, I suppose)
about someone's mailbox too full and messages couldn't be delivered -- so I
just ignore that unless in fact it WAS someone I intentionally addressed
a message to.  Then I retrans later on or something.

So not to worry - got your reply, and am digesting it now.

Thanks, and best Christmas and holiday wishes...

a glitch when I uploaded it.  Thanks to Charley Strom and Bob Plouffe for
catching and confirming the problem.  The file had been replaced as of

MDM715.ASM.2 and the CRC checks correctly with the original I received
from the RCPM world.  The problem was with my upload, not the original
file, so if you got yours from an RCPM it's ok.  Most people don't need
the 140k+ .ASM file and probably were not affected.  Just get the .COM

Ed - The rejected mail message you got from Comsat at mit-ml was not the result
of your message to David Kirschbaum, but rather the result of your having sent
a copy to info-cpm.  The list contains an entry "GZ-MICROS@mit-mc" which used
to be a good address.  However, for the last several days everything sent to
that address as part of the info-cpm distribution seems to have bounced.  Apparently, mit-mc is forwarding mail with that address to mit-ml
which doesn't recognize the address.  If it doesn't clear up soon, I'll delete
the entry from the list.

Subject:  USR S-100 modem overlay for MDM7xx

Phil Lapsley has released a new overlay for MDM7xx for the new US
Robotics 300/1200 baud S-100 modem.  The overlay works on MDM712 and
later (including the latest MDM715).  It's available on SIMTEL20 in the
MICRO:<CPM.MODEM7> directory as M7US-1.ASM.

Dave Hardy (Microsystems author and Sysop of TCBBS Dearborn MI) had one
of these modems for evaluation several months ago.  He ran into some
problems trying to use it with the BYE program on his Sysop
Clearinghouse RCPM but eventually found what was wrong.  I suggested
that Phil contact Dave for details and here's some information that Dave
Hardy passed along which may belp others trying to use this modem with
BYE.

Subject: USR overlay

   I talked with Dave Hardy this morning, and we hashed out a few
things. His problem was on auto-answer, which mdm715 doesn't really have
to cope with.  On AA, the USR changes the baud rate to suit the incoming
call, but it never tells anyone that it changed.  Therefore, things get
excellent when one tries to send commands to it when it is at a
different baud rate than one expected.

   But he confirmed what I suspected: the board is not meant to run
faster than 4 MHz (i.e., my 5) and he agreed I should have some
time-padding do nothing stuff in there to slow things down (as an aside,
another flaw on the board is there is no provision for wait states).

   In M7US-1.ASM the initialization routine are two XCHG statements
after each OUT statement. They are commented-out (i.e., ";        XCHG")
so they will not be there for people who use slower systems.  However,
there is a note explain- ing what they are for and telling people with
fast systems to remove the semi- colons and fix things up.

   I have tested this one fairly extensively, and without the delay it
locks up.  With the delay I have yet to be able to cause it to lock.

To:   Info-Cpm@brl-vgr

LRUN, a utility to allow the user to "run" .COM files stored in an LBR
file called COMMAND.LBR, is now available on SIMTEL20 in the
MICRO:<CPM.CPMLIB> directory.  This program has been available for
some time but I neglected to upload it to SIMTEL20 until someone asked
about it a few days ago.

Putting many small .COM files inside one .LBR file often saves quite a
bit of disk space, especially on a hard disk where the group size may
be 4k or even 8k minimum.  LRUN allows passing full command-line
arguements to the user program.

Subject:  BYE3-15 now available

BYE3 v1.5 (revised 12/15/83) is now available on SIMTEL20.
                                 
This program allows modem callers to use your CP/M system just as if
they were seated at the system console.  Special assembly-time options
allow limiting the caller's access by password and/or access to only a
message-service program.  A number of external routines are available
to adapt this program to various computers.

Revisions:

12/15/83 Included a new Smartmodem routine.  This will be needed by
 v3-15   most users since the Smartmodem (or similar, such as the U.S.
         Robotics) are in common use.  (There were four different rou-
         tines being used in the various external inserts.  This will
         standardize that to just one version.)  Hopefully this routine
         will prevent reception of any incoming call until it is ready
         for the call.  (Steve Holtzclaw's extensive Smartmodem routine
         which checks echo characters may still be required under some
         cirumstances.  It is not needed with the US Robotics modems.)
         This version has been tested extensively on several RCPM sys-
         systems using several different types of computers, including
         2651, 2661, 2850 and 2851 I/O devices..
                                      - Irv Hoff and John Ferguson

12/11/83 Added the fixes suggested by Steve Holtzclaw, John Ferguson,
  v1.4   Dave Crane and Byron Mckay in various messages and contacts.
         This involves resetting the stack and the Smartmodem when ex-
         iting.  Should prevent further hangups occasionally occuring.
                                      - Irv Hoff

12/07/83 Added missing labels for PWMSG and WRGMSG and also the IF
  v1.3   statement missing before NULLS (IF NOT OXGATE).  Also added
         the newest SMINIT and MDQUIT routines extensively tested
         and used on-line (3 months) with BY2-17KS.
