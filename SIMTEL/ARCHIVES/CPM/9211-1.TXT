Yes, I have just acquired one of these machines.  It reminds of high school.
And the problem is I would like to be able to read and write to the machine
so I can download programs to the machine (I don't have a terminal program,
nothing for the machine.  I haven't yet found anyone locally with the programs
yet (just started), so I am floating my request for help on the net.
Also, what about CPM for the machine (its a ModelIII w/h 64k and the double
drives.)

Thanks a lot,

Welcome to MYZ80!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
MYZ80 is a Z80/64180 emulator package. It was written to allow you 
to finally get rid of those old Z80 computers which have done so 
many fine years of service. The new 80386 machines with the fast 
hard drives and the snazzy OS/2 operating systems are such a 
delight... but for many, the Z80 machines still have to be fired 
up from to time in order to develop code for CP/M and the Z80 
chip. Well, not any more, thanks to MYZ80.

Other emulators on the market are less than satisfactory 
solutions. Of the small number which can actually run without 
causing system errors under the later versions of DOS, apparently 
none are capable of running real CP/M. Instead they use an 
emulated version of CP/M which is only as accurate as the 
developers have bothered to make it.

None can run CP/M 3.0, and none can run ZCPR (which is such a 
useful Z80 developer's environment). Add to that their less than 
perfect Z80 emulation and slow overall performance, and until 
MYZ80, the 'real' Z80 machines were destined to remain in the 
office.

MYZ80 provides the solution being conceived, born and nurtured to 
the point where it is now the most useful Z80 emulator package 
ever!


MYZ80 features.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
MYZ80 emulates the instruction set of the 8080, Z80 and Z180/64180 
CPU chips. It does this with the "MicroFast Z80 Emulation Engine" 
which is a very highly tuned piece of code designed to be as fast 
and as accurate as technically possible on 80286, 80386 and 80486 
CPUs.

MYZ80 provides an interface (the MYZ80 API) to the host computer 
which allows real Z80 BDOSes to run in the MYZ80 environment. This 
interface provides disk and character I/O as well as two banks of 
64k RAM (with common area) and a large RAM disk. These unique 
features allow MYZ80 to run 'real' CP/M 2.2, CP/M 3.0, Z-System 
and ZPM3.

MYZ80 is designed for the latest multitasking operating systems 
and makes Z80 programs 'host friendly'. MYZ80 will share time very 
fairly with the host. Even multiple instances of MYZ80 are 
supported.

MYZ80 can take advantage of the latest computer hardware for 
increased performance. The Microfast Z80 Emulation Engine operates 
in either 16 (80286) or 32 (80386/80486) bit mode depending on the 
capabilities of the host computer.

MYZ80 runs beautifully on IBM AT compatible (or better) computers 
under DOS 3.3 compatible (or later) operating systems. This 
includes running under OS/2 2.0, Desqview, and Windows 3.x.


Starting MYZ80.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
MYZ80 is started from the DOS command line by simply typing the 
name of its executable (CPM). However, advanced users may wish to 
include optional arguments on the command line.

The first argument is the name of a boot file to be used instead 
of the default (BOOT.CPM), and following arguments are saved by 
MYZ80 and may be retrieved from within the MYZ80 environment.

MYZ80 always looks for its support files in the directory it 
resides in. Therefore, you may start MYZ80 from any directory or 
disk, and it will always find its support files (as long as they 
are in the same directory as CPM.EXE).

MYZ80 may be run from a floppy disk (although a hard disk is 
recommended). To do so, put CPM.EXE and the support files onto the 
floppy disk, and start the program.


Leaving MYZ80.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
There are two ways to exit from the MYZ80 environment. You may 
select the 'Abort and exit' choice from the pause box menu, or you 
may run the MYZ80 utility QUIT.COM. The latter method also allows 
you to specify an error level to return to DOS with (for use in 
batch files).


Further information.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Some explanations of the terms used above and further information 
will be displayed to you when you start MYZ80 for the first time. 
Legal information is provided in the file READ.1ST which was 
supplied with this package. All the MYZ80 utilities have online 
help. Other support files for MYZ80 should be provided in the 
future and will probably be available from the place where you 
found this package.


The version of MYZ80 that you have now may not be perfect, but it 
is pretty close! It has been released so that as many people as 
possible can join the MYZ80 revolution, and keep CP/M and Z80 
alive for years to come. Please enjoy it.



Simeon Cran.

Radio Shack sells a little RS-232 tester for under $20 which could show if
your Kaypro is putting out the proper signals.  It's about the size of a
null-modem adapter, with seven two-color LEDs on it.  You can leave it plugged
into the computer for neat-looking blinky lights.  By the way, does your
modem have lights?  Do any of them light up when it's connected to the Kaypro?
It's possible you could have damaged the modem by plugging it into the Amiga
with power on (making a squelching noise?).  You could also damage the Amiga.
If you use the same modem with two computers,  you should get an A/B switch.

Yep, Wang Office Assistant, primarily a dedicated Word Processor, used a
80186 CPU, I repaired those boxes back in '85 -'86  not very exciting,
they did have some packages other than Wordprocessing, incl. spreadsheet and
communications packages, sorry, it didnt support MS-DOS or other 'known'
operating systems. If I remember correctly, the WOA-20 had a 360k floppy 
and a WOA-40 incl a 10 MB h/disk  and were sold with a printer eg Diablo.
You could use it for parts, or rip the m/bd out and buy more suitable
m/bd.

Subject: TRS-80 to MSDOS....
Message-ID: <9211030047.AA19081@st6000.sct.edu>

hi,

   As far as I know, the Model 4/4D/4P will run CP/M without any other
modifications, as opposed to at least the Model III which I'm aware of
which requires a hardware board....forgot who makes it....

   Anyway, theres a program/utility called supercross XT or something
of that nature which allows you to read and write other operating systems
including MSDOS but this runs under the MOdel III operating system and
Model 4 Trsdos.....
 
   For CP/M, there's a customized CP/M called Montezuma Micro CP/M
which comes with a system configuration program which allows you to read
, write and format different kinds of CP/M disks on your model 4 and it
also takes into consideration what kind of floppy you have, single sided,
double sided, quad density (80 track), etc....
   By the way, this is CP/M 2.2 which is far superior to Radio Shack's
 CP/M 3.0......and also available (don't know where you can find it these
days ) for this CP/M is "Monte's Toolkit" which includes disk formating
and reading utilities, including a virtual file utility for moving files
between CP/M, TRSDOS, or MSDOS.....

  As for the latter program, Supercross XT, I believe there was also an
Ibm/tandy version which allowed you to read TRS-80 disks on a DOS machine...

  The CP/M 2.2 is still currently available from a company somewhere......
the information escapes me at the moment, but I know places that still sell
TRS-80 Software and hardware


   current updated stuff available for this defunct line of computers are:
 
  mouse
  3 1/2" floppies
  realtime clocks
  conversion for gif files to TRS-80 high res-graphics board format
  mouse to keyboard interface
  mouse drivers...
  external drive modification using the 50 pin rear connector


  I myself have (my original computer), a TRS-80 4P, non-gate array,
 128k, high-res graphics card, and other hardware modifications...

  As far as communications programs, there's quite a bit in public
domain, including XModem and Kermit standalone programs....

Does anyone know of Chris Rutowski or Rising Star Industries? They
wrote all the Valdocs software that ran on TPM on the Epson QX-10
around 1984, then went bust because Epson screwed them.

I would like to have his mailing address.

Subject: Kermit for Cromemco's
Message-ID: <1992Nov2.133932.12562@ee.rochester.edu>

Hi all.

We have a few Cromemco CS-1 computers running CDOS/CPM and some local, 10
year old, communications software.  The University has changed the
communications structure and this software is now flaky at best.  We
would like to run some version of kermit so that atleast we have standard
software and documentation as to its functionality.

These Cromemco computers only have floppy drives and serial ports so
thatwe are limited how we can obtain software.  When I contacted
Columbia they could ship us the version for our machine but not on media
that we can use.

My question is, does any one have kermit for a cromemco CS-1 that I can
get/buy/whatever on a 5 1/4 inch floppy?  Any other suggestions would
greatly be appreciated also.

This can be handled with 22DISK, at least version 1.30 or better; use
the SOFS parameter instead of OFS.  From the manual:

       SOFS  indicates the number of sectors that are  used  for  storing
            the  CP/M  system  and  BIOS at the beginning of a diskette.
            SOFS is used when the number of sectors used by the CP/M  is
            not  an  integral  number of tracks,  such as for the Coleco
            Adam.

All Kaypro CPM machines use the telephone cable. You can use or borrow the
cable from any telephone handset. If your machine is dysfunctional, the
problem lies elsewhere.

Subject: What is MYZ80?
Message-ID: <VikDTB2w164w@naos.actrix.gen.nz>

I've received a number of email messages asking what MyZ80 is, and what
it does.  I didn't post this in my last message because there had been
some discussion recently.  To answer the question, here's a bit of the
documentation file...

--- cut here --- cut here --- cut here ---
                            M Y Z 8 0
                            =========

                         by Simeon Cran.

Welcome to MYZ80!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
MYZ80 is a Z80/64180 emulator package. It was written to allow you 
to finally get rid of those old Z80 computers which have done so 
many fine years of service. The new 80386 machines with the fast 
hard drives and the snazzy OS/2 operating systems are such a 
delight... but for many, the Z80 machines still have to be fired 
up from to time in order to develop code for CP/M and the Z80 
chip. Well, not any more, thanks to MYZ80.

Other emulators on the market are less than satisfactory 
solutions. Of the small number which can actually run without 
causing system errors under the later versions of DOS, apparently 
none are capable of running real CP/M. Instead they use an 
emulated version of CP/M which is only as accurate as the 
developers have bothered to make it.

None can run CP/M 3.0, and none can run ZCPR (which is such a 
useful Z80 developer's environment). Add to that their less than 
perfect Z80 emulation and slow overall performance, and until 
MYZ80, the 'real' Z80 machines were destined to remain in the 
office.

MYZ80 provides the solution being conceived, born and nurtured to 
the point where it is now the most useful Z80 emulator package 
ever!

MYZ80 features.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
MYZ80 emulates the instruction set of the 8080, Z80 and Z180/64180 
CPU chips. It does this with the "MicroFast Z80 Emulation Engine" 
which is a very highly tuned piece of code designed to be as fast 
and as accurate as technically possible on 80286, 80386 and 80486 
CPUs.

MYZ80 provides an interface (the MYZ80 API) to the host computer 
which allows real Z80 BDOSes to run in the MYZ80 environment. This 
interface provides disk and character I/O as well as two banks of 
64k RAM (with common area) and a large RAM disk. These unique 
features allow MYZ80 to run 'real' CP/M 2.2, CP/M 3.0, Z-System 
and ZPM3.

MYZ80 is designed for the latest multitasking operating systems 
and makes Z80 programs 'host friendly'. MYZ80 will share time very 
fairly with the host. Even multiple instances of MYZ80 are 
supported.

MYZ80 can take advantage of the latest computer hardware for 
increased performance. The Microfast Z80 Emulation Engine operates 
in either 16 (80286) or 32 (80386/80486) bit mode depending on the 
capabilities of the host computer.

MYZ80 runs beautifully on IBM AT compatible (or better) computers 
under DOS 3.3 compatible (or later) operating systems. This 
includes running under OS/2 2.0, Desqview, and Windows 3.x.

And a little bit detailing the system requirements, from the readme
file.

--- cut here --- cut here --- cut here ---
                       System Requirements.
                       ====================

For MYZ80 to work at all it needs:
IBM AT compatible (or better)
300k free RAM
DOS 3.3 or later
Disk drive

MYZ80 can also make good use of the following system  resources if 
available (None of these is required to get  good performance  out 
of MYZ80):
Hard disk drive
More than 300k free RAM
DOS 5.00
XMS memory
Multi-tasker (such as OS/2 2.x, Desqview or Windows 3.x)
32 bit CPU (80386,80486)
--- cut here --- cut here --- cut here ---

MyZ80 does meet it's claims, at least for me.  I'm running it on a
286/10, and the emulated environment is almost as fast as a 3/4Mhz Z80
running native.  On a faster machine, it'd be amazing to use.

To repeat the bit from the previous post; the latest version of MyZ80 is
version 1.03.  I've received several "where can I get it requests".
Because the only site I know that it is definitely on is a long way off
the net and pays for all traffic both incomming and outgoing, I don't
want to post the site address.  Please if I've emailed you the address
and you've retrieved it, would you _please_ upload it to some of the
bigger archive sites (could someone post a message when they've uploaded
it to Simtel, eg).  Thank you.

I think you might have a little trouble with the ICL Quattro.
I vaguely remember when I tried it that the number of reserved tracks was
not an integer, so the directory started partway into a track. No software
I could find could cope with this.

Modems are not supposed to be _powered_ from the serial port. The Amiga does
provide +12V power for external devices, but this is not _standard_ behavior.
The only thing modems are supposed to take from the serial port are modem
signals.

You should check out HMODEM-II which ZMP and RZMP were based upon. It
comes with source in C. As to Jmodem, source has always been available
for that one. Both in C and in ASM.

This was not very widely spread, but I once knew a fellow that had this
eprom on his TS-803... it even came with special key caps. The product
was a third-party add-on.

Also, related info: there was a product from Digital Engineering in
Sacramento, (916) 447-7600 that gave the TeleVideo 910, 912, 920, 925
and 950 Tektronix 4027 and 4010 emulation... also Selanar Graphics in
Santa Clara, (408) 727-2811 offered a similar product.

Sorry to say that I can't tell you who had the WordStar modification for
these units though.

BTW, WordStar has no problem with these terminals, except that the
control commands are different than produced by the editing keys, so you
have to use the ctrl-key, as per normal for WordStar on most machines.

There is also PC-CRoss-Zap, which runs under MS-DOS on the PC, and 
is supplied by Hypersoft at:

    PO Box 51155, Raleigh, NC 27609 USA

They also make Hypercross which runs on the Model III and allows
you to read-write, under TRS-80 operating systems, PC and CP/M 
disks.

There are memory-mapped versions of some software, e.g. Wordstar

You shouldn't need a mod for the Model III, which is built to take 
two internal and two external drives. It's the Model 4P that has 
to be modified to take more than two drives.

 In the Toronto, Canada, area it can be found (MYZ80103.ZIP, 75k)
 on Baudeville BBS at (416) 283-6059.  Go through the call-back
 verification to get download access.

Subject: CP/M emulator for MAC?
Message-ID: <1992Nov3.235318.24843@tdb.uu.se>

Hello CP/M world and lovers!

Does anyone know if there is a CP/M emulator for the Macintosh?
Or maybe any source-code to port? I would like to hear about it
if there is...

All I have seen so far is for MS/DOS or UNIX.

I do got a swedish CP/P comuter called JET-80, but my desk-top
is not large enough for the MAC QUADRA and the JET-80 :-(

I hope there is a solution to this...

I now have MYZ80 (demo) up and running and am very happy.  However I got off
SIMTEL the Forth programming language package Uniforth and got it to give
myz80 trouble.  When I went to edit a screen I was given a invalide instruction
error.  I don't have it were with me so I can't give you the code.  I hope this
helps in futher revisions of myz80.  I love my old ADAM CP/M but I have to face
the facts; myz80 is faster (about 5X or better) on my 486 33Mhz, and is easier
to use as far as transportability goes.  I will still fire up my ADAM but out
of respect for the years it carried me through college.  I used Uniforth for
years with no problems on my ADAM and if this problem gets fixed I will
register asap.  Thank you MYZ80-master!!!

(oops -- had a small problem there, lets try again:)

Hi, I'm looking for a reasonable C compiler for my old MAX-80.
Either a native compiler, or a cross compiler that I can
run under Unix.  Is there anything available?

Is there anyone else out there who has a MAX-80 from Lobo Systems?

Thanks!

	Well, the "5 volts" was supplied by a friend of mine who may or may
not know what he's talking about, but certainly knows more than me.  What I
meant to say is that, whatever the voltage is, it's not putting out the right
kind of juice.
	I have a Hayes compatible modem which, when I plug it into my Amiga,
makes a sort of "squelch", indicating that the serial is supplying it with
eliectricity.  It does no such thing when I plug it into the Kaypro, and,
not surprisingly, does not respond to Hayes-commands (ATH0, etc.).  It just
sits there.
	Parting from this, I'll rephrase my original question:

	IS the +/- 9v output in the Kaypro a sufficient standard to assume
that my Amiga puts out the same quantity?  If this is so, then the serial
on the Kaypro IS damaged, as the modem receives no power.

	You've probably noticed by now that I don't have a voltage meter.
I know it's gauche to use a hayes-comp. as a meter (or LED) for my serial
ports, but hey...  :-)

Two public domain C compilers I know of are Small-C (the DDJ version), and
Micro-C.  Small-C is available at SIMTEL-20 (in the CPM.SMALLC21 directory)
and I forget where I got Micro-C (look for MC132 with archie).  I do know
the version I ftp'd had a critical file corrupted so it was useless for
Z80 code.  If I find a good version I'll post a note here.

Subject: Re: 5v out serial port
Message-ID: <JOT.92Oct30114120@teak09.cray.com>

The RS-232 standard, defines a "mark" as a voltage between +3V and
+12V; a "space" as a voltage between -12V and -3V (or, just possibly,
the other way around.)  (And just maybe 15V, not 12V?)  Notice that 0V
doesn't "mean" anything.

However, folks noticed that 0V and +5V would "operate" many modems,
even though it shouldn't.

If you are seeing 0V and +5V, you are probably trying to plug directly
into the UART, which is maybe not the best thing in the world to do;
it was intended that there be some sort of line driver between the
UART and the rest of the world.  I would not care to guess what
happens to one of those chips if it is connected to a modem which
applies -12V to the input.

Read this one with interest, in the UK the Amstrad PCW range (CP/M based) still
selling well. Magazines still published to support it, together with huge range of application software and GAMES.

I don't have one myself, although do still own a CP/M machine, that also runs 
UNPLUS System III Unix on a 68000 co-processor board.

Hope this of interest, if you would like details of the magazine then drop me 
a note and I will get them from newsagent next time i visit.

I think NEC built one. And then there's the MSX crowd in Japan (although
a Japanese foreign-exchange student just laughed when I mentioned MSX). I've
also seen a color Sony machine.

If, by dead, you mean not covered by the mainstream press, yes. If, by dead,
you mean that nothing is available, no. If, by dead, you mean no one is doing

Speaking of which, does anyone have manuals for CP/NET? I'm interested

Hello !
I just got a Z80 CP/M computer from a friend.
I has a to floppy drives. Comes with a system disk, and a copy of 
WordStar. Well it was interest messing around with this computer, and 
now I want to know more!

This is what I would like to find out:

Where there ever any CP/M computers with a moniter other than mono?

Could somebody tell me where I can find games and other programs for this 
thing? FTP's?

Is the the CP/M Market dead? 

Does anybody have a CP/M system manual on file?

Well that is about it for now, thanks!

P.S. Could you please send all your answers to my E-Mail address, because
     I do not usually read this news group.

P.P.S. Oh yes! One more thing. Is it possible to network my CP/M Computer
	to my IBM? Through the serial port?

I remember seeing ads for graphics boards running on the S-100 bus, and
thus usable by a Z-80 board on the bus running CP/M.  The only company
name I can think of right now is Cromeco.  Ahhh!  Back in the good old
days - when power supplies doubled as arc welders, and portable meant
that you could transport the computer without having to use a truck. (-:

There was a color graphics board for CP/M Kaypros -- I know -- I have
one that I bought from one of the engineers that designed it.  It was
made by MicroSphere.  It uses the Texas Instruments TI-9918A chip,
which gives 256x192 resolution, 16 colors and 32 sprites.  This is the
same chip that a lot of game machines and early micro computers used,
like the Texas Instruments TI99.

I had started writing a set of procedures for it with Turbo Modula 2,
but I have not found the time to finish it.

I also remember reading about a color graphics board that plugged into
a standard Centronics parallel port, so you drive it from virtually any
computer.  I think I saw this back in '86 or '87.  I don't remember
what company made it.

MIX-C was manufactured and sold by MIX Software, Richardson, Texas,
1-800-333-0330, for about 20$, with a 300 hundred pages documentation
included. Yes I am definitely talking about MIX-C for CP/M-80. No I am not
talking about Power-C for MESSDOSS which they continuously advertise (Ok, I
own, use and warmly praise both).
I will be glad to sell my CP/M-80 copy for 100$ or  more if and only if:
a) MIX C stills sells it and for 20$.
b) MIX C explicitly agrees with that deal.
In spite of the induced headache, I would certainly do that for any colleague
in search of a copy about as old as her/his computer .... ,-}

If and only if MIX Software or their legal representatives issue a clear and
unambiguous statement of complete loss of interest, I will gladly upload
my copy for public usage. The documentation will remain a problem.

I've been trying out myz80 and it's very impressive. But there's 
one problem: I can't get CP/M Kermit to work with it. I have to 
use serial port 2 for DOS communications (mouse on port 1), so I 
wondered whether the emulator can use a serial port, whether it 
uses port 1 by default, and if so whether there's any means of 
making it use port 2 instead. I couldn't find anything about this 
in the docs that came with the trial version. Does anyone know the 
answer?

Subject: Re: small C problem.

You just found out that real numbers are not handled by your compiler.
So what about buying MIX-C once for all for 20$?
I do not have any interest with MIX software, I just repeat from my experience,
pay these 20$ and begin to ENJOY programming in C with your beloved computer,
instead of limiting yourself with a compiler which IS a beautiful thing, for
which Mr. Hendrix deserves our eternal gratitude, a C compiler written in C,
with all the sources available, etc, etc, a superb laboratory/demonstration
object, written for that purpose, but definitely not to write APPLICATIONS.
If you read the articles in DDJ that came with the compiler, and/or Hendrix's
****excellent**** book on the compiler and library, you will see that the
exclusion of the REAL type was deliberate.
When you begin using MIX-C @ 20$ instead, you will also be amazed by the
ratio of elapsed time needed to compile and build the .COM file, not only
because of the intermediate assembly in Small C.
I don't wish to be flamed as if I was denying the extraordinary qualities
of Small C, including its null price (not quite, if you need the books and
the Microsoft M-80 assembler, although I know that NOW there are free almost
compatible assemblers, which PERHAPS correctly assemble ANY code generated
by Small-C).
I just warmly suggest to APPLICATIONS programmers to save a lot of headache
for 20$ only.
If MIX doesn't send me a new copy of the compiler which I anyway already have
after such a post ....

Hi!
My name is Chuck Stewart, and I'm the person who posted an
article trying to sell my Kaypro-4 on this newsgroup awhile back.
To all those who responded; Thank you!
I'm sorry I'm so late getting back to you all, but things got
strange around here again...:}
It seems that I will not be able to sell the Kaypro for enough to
get even a start on a used 8086, so I will have to do the best I
can with it.
To do so I will need to talk with the modern world, and that
requires VT100 or ANSI emulation instead of VT52. I asked about
this awhile back and someone mentioned   (QTerm)? (4xx)?
Does anyone know if this is it, and if it is; where can I get it?
I would be extremely grateful for any information I can receive!

Subject: Need system disks for TRS-80 Model 4P
Message-ID: <1dmgmbINN1mt@agate.berkeley.edu>

I've adopted another orphan.  This time it's a TRS-80 Model 4P.
Unfortunately, the system disks that I got with the machine are
trashed.  Therefore I'm looking for...

A TRSDOS 6 boot disk (with appropriate utilities) for running in
model 4 mode.

An earlier TRSDOS boot disk (for running in Model 3 mode).

and

A CP/M system disk (with the transient commands) for running CP/M.

I will, of course, pay media and shipping costs.

Now if I could just find someone willing to sell me a Model 16
for the same price, my "orphan museum" would be off to a good start.

UniForm does not seem to run anymore on recent MSDOS versions. It was of 
questionable use anyway, at least not generally usable, since it was not 
configurable to arbitrary formats. This is both unfortunate because its 
concept of installing virtual drives instead of implementing copy commands 
was certainly the nicer one.
Dan Fandrich recently announced a new program to install virtual drives 
handling CP/M disks (if I understood him right), but - again unfortunately - 
it doesn't seem to have been released yet.

I don't specifically know what versions are available, but try
watsun.cc.columbia.edu (128.59.39.1) for anonymous FTP.  It is the official
distribution site for kermit, and it has versions for just about every
computer that ever existed.

BDS C, one of the best CP/M C compilers is still on the market, and is
quite reasonably priced, I believe.  It's currently marketed and
supported by Jay Sage of Sage Microsystems East.  You can reach him on
his BBS at 617-965-7259 (password "DDT") or by voice at 617-569-3552,
call about 10 Eastern time.  BDS C is a nearly complete K&R
implementation which makes fairly tight code and was the leader of the
pack at one point in speed benchmarks.

Floating point conversion is a complex business and not easily
implemented on 8080 or Z80 based machines.  Even commercial C compilers
such as BDS C implemented floating point arithmetic via special
functions which were included in an add-on floating point library.
Programs which I wrote using floating point arithmetic ususally handled
floating point numbers as strings which were I/O'd with %s rather than
%f.  There may be floating point libraries around for small C.  This is
certainly the place to advirtise for them.  Another source of
information, or so I'm told, is the CP/M echo of FidoNet which is
reportedly a good deal more active than this one.

I received a message from Simeon Cran on fidonet that addressed
this issue. Polled serial I/O can be done by direct access to the
UART's at 3f8-3fe and 2f8-2fe (i.e. COM1 & COM2). These port
addresses in the 8088's I/O space map to ports 00-06 and 08-0e (or
10-16) in the Z80's I/O space. I can't remember the port addresses
for COM2, but they're there.

You'll need to know the details of how to talk to an 8250, but
there's any amount of reference material available on that
subject.

The next version (1.03) also includes BIOS/FOSSIL serial support,
although I don't have the details of that here.

 The 4P will also read an Osborne format (185K capacity).  There is also
a Zenith format (152K or 156K) that should work..

My experience with MicroSolutions has been that they are helpful and
responsive to tech problems.  If you are having trouble with UniForm,
you should contact them as I'm sure they keep up to date with DOS
version updates and issue updates of UniForm in response.  Although I
use and recommend 22DISK myself, I've had at least one professional CP/M
software distrbutor (thankfully, this is not yet an oxymoron) tell me
that UniForm is the more reliable of the two.

MicroSolutions runs a BBS at 815-756-9100 in the US.

There is an obscure support department at Tandy called "Tandy Software
Assembly".  Most Radio Shack employees don't know about it because they
don't read the employee manual.  Anyway, if you don't have any luck with
your post, and you can round up the original catalog numbers of the items
you need, get a Tandy employee to call this department and order it for
you.  Last I heard, you can get copies of disks, replacements, etc., for
$7.00 per disk.

Congrat's on the TRS-80 4P.  May I suggest a subscription to Computer 
News 80 magazine.  This magazine contains all the DOS's you're looking
for, and MUCH more.  It's only $24 a year and is distributed monthly.
When you order a Model 3 boot disk, be sure that it includes the file
MODELA/III.  This file is a software ROM, as the 4P has no built in ROM, 
as the rest of the Model 4 family has.
    If you're a member on GEnie, stop by the Tandy RT as we boast several
files for the Models 1/3/4 there!  CN80 magazine also provides a 
download-through-the-mail service for nominal charges.

The Fido Cpm echo has about 15- 20 messages a day
 Do anyone know where a list of Cp/m os disk are?

Subject: 22DISK problem with trs-80 4p
Message-ID: <10NOV199219471721@zeus.tamu.edu>

I have a trs-80 model 4p and and 486/clone. I have been getting software
of the net for the 4p but its all on my pc. So i got 22disk to hopefully
write all this good stuff to my model 4's cpm disks.
Unforunately, 22disk doesn't (seem) to support my version of cpm.
I think its cpm plus 3.0 : according to anadisk it has a 2:1 interleave
and sector ids 0-17 and 256 byte sectors.

Can anyone tell me how to get this format working with 22disk?

thanks, jason.

Hi There!

Here's an interesting question:
My Kaypro-4 , of course , cannot handle graphics.
I cannot afford a new computer for a long time. I must make do with the Kaypro.
So. I am an anime fan and I would like to PRINT OUT GIF's. (Stop laughiing!
You! In the corner! Stop laughing!  ;)
Has anyone ever written a program for a Kaypro-4 to
PRINT Gif's on a dot matrix printer? 
I have an Epson RX-80.
Please stop giggling; you're making the Kaaypro nervous...:)

Subject: cp/m - dos conversion
Message-ID: <CMM.0.90.4.721524833.ephillip@magnus.acs.ohio-state.edu>

For quite a while, I have struggled with the problem of converting
all my old CP/M stuff to my dos computer, as many of you have (evident
by the number of messages on the subject!). I have finally succeeded.
While there are many programs out there that simulate the cp/m-os
on dos, they either lacked the ability to directly read/write a
cp/m formatted disk, or you were forced to use the old modem
technique to get the files into your dos. No More! I have discovered
a company called "Intersecting Concepts", @ 30851 Agoura Rd,
Suite 200, Agoura Hills, Ca 91301 ph:818-879-0086. They have
produced a product called "Media Master" which runs flawlessly
on my IBM-PC AT 286 w/dos v.5 that logs in my a:floppy drive
as a Morrow MD-2 (SSDD) (which was one of my old cp/m machines).
It will also log in many other 5-1/4" cp/m disk formats, up to
I think close to 70 of 'em! You can then directly read/write the
cp/m floppy disk, copying all of the files if you wish onto your
dos machine's harddrive. Then, Media Master has a cp/m-os emulator,
called "ZP/EM" which runs the cp/m software! Of course, the program
"myz80" does this well too, but Media Master is one program that
does everything in one package, negating the need to run 2 or
more pieces of software just to run cp/m on dos. BTW, all of the
standard disclaimers apply re:my working for them or getting
financial consideration from the (I don't!). I just finally found
something that works after more than 2 years of searching. Man,
it's just like sitting at the console of my old Morrow! Absolutely
seamless, I tell ya! Hope this helps all of you looking for a
solution. BTW, the price? Just about $70 bucks, ups'ed to your
door!

UniForm does not seem to run anymore on recent MSDOS versions. It was of 
questionable use anyway, at least not generally usable, since it was not 
configurable to arbitrary formats. This is both unfortunate because its 
concept of installing virtual drives instead of implementing copy commands 
was certainly the nicer one.
Dan Fandrich recently announced a new program to install virtual drives 
handling CP/M disks (if I understood him right), but - again unfortunately - 
it doesn't seem to have been released yet.

I hope someone can help Chris find a Hard drive.  They do exist, but
I don't know where.  2 MB RAM disks also exist with Batter backup,
which is a good way to go.  I still use the two-disk drive system.
Tomorrow I'll bring the address of the EPSON usre's group in

How about:

The Apple Lisa was, simplistically, a product ahead of its time. One might 
say that it was the first Macintosh. In fact, a number of them were sold in 
the late 1980's as a cheap machine which would run Mac software.

I suggest that you seek a Macintosh forum in which to ask further questions.

and the 6128 machines are color too.  Amstrad have just launched a new Z80 based
notebook although I don't think it runs CP/M.   It was reviewed recently in
Byte under the comment "last Z80 machine ?",  we'll see.  The Tatung Einstein
was also a color CP/M machine, although the color monitor only supported
40 columns.

  Hello Guys

  I have worked for a year and a half on QX-10 and 16 before leaving the 
school where I was teaching.  At that time, I gave away 3 QX-10, 2 QX-16
2 20 Mb hard disks and all the original technical documentation.  Had to do
that as I was leaving the country and could not afford to take them along.
  In the US, I enquired about QXs for the good times sakes, and came up
with those two addresses:

   Star Technology Corporation
   900 Road 170
   Carbondale, CO 81623     (303)963-1969

     I found their prices much too high ( $679 for a 20 Mb, 65 ms 
   hard disk )

   SnyderScope International
   1594 Hilltop Drive
   El Cajon, CA 92020-8227  (619)442-2299

     SnyderScope was in the process of closing its QX interests in 1991, so
   I don't know if they might be of help.  They might be kind and give you
   a few tips on how to hack a QX to MFM or RLL interface so that you can 
   use a regular DOS drive.

  Happy hacking

Call MISOSYS (1-800-misosys) and buy LS-DOS 6.3.1.  Model 4 TRSDOS 6
is LS-DOS with the Radio Shack name (as PC-DOS is to MS-DOS).  This
is the latest version (released last year).  I believe it is $39.

If you want TRSDOS 1.3, you will have to go to Radio Shack.  I would
suggest getting LDOS 5.3.1 from MISOSYS.  It works almost exactly like
LS-DOS, but in Model 3 mode.  It blows TRSDOS 1.3 out of the water.
(some Model 3 software will only run under TRSDOS 1.3, though).
>

I believe Computer News 80 has Montezuma Micro CPM 2.2.  This is your
best bet.  Radio Shack CPM was based on CPM version 3.0.  I've heard
a lot of complaints about the Radio Shack port of it (never used it myself).

Lindsay Haisley was kind in mentioning me as a source for BDS C, but there
were two inaccuracies that should be corrected.  First, Sage Microsystems
East is my wife's company.  They carry all the products I like, and I am
happy to provide technical support.  In the case of BDS C, I worked with
Leor Zolman to develop the Z-System version of BDS C, with is now included
along with the older CP/M version in the standard BDS C product package.

A more serious error in Lindsay's message was the mirror-imaging of part of
Sage Microsystem's phone number.  I won't repeat the wrong number; the
correct number is 617-965-3552.  The number for the BBS was correct
(965-7259).  The recommendation to call voice late in the evening was also
correct.  The best time to find me at home is between 11 pm and midnight
Eastern time (even that will fail on occasion).  I'm happy to talk about
almost any subject related to CP/M-compatible computing.

   As far as I know, MIX C is still available from Ed Grey, who reads (and
occasionally posts to) this newsgroup.  I'm afraid I do not have his email

   It was nice of someone in a recent posting to recommend my wife's
company, Sage Microsystems East, as a source for Turbo Pascal for CP/M. 
Unfortunately, that product is no longer available.  After Borland declined
to renew Alpha Software's license, Bill Roch (Elliam Associates) and I tried
to convince them to release the software in some form (such as licenses to
other distributors), but they refused.  This is a real shame, because Turbo
Pascal is still an excellent product.  If Borland finds it too much trouble
to count the small sums of money a license could bring in (for no work on
their part at all), the least they could do is release the product to the
public domain.

   I've been promising for some time to release the zmp/rzmp sources, but
it's one of those things I just don't seem to have got around to yet! I'm
currently looking into a Windows version for PCs, so I just rooted out the
sources again. I'll try and post them in the next week or so. Be warned though
that it may not be easy to recompile zmp from the sources: I had to resort to
a few fiddles to get it to compile and run in what is, after all, a rather
restrictive environment for that sort of thing (I had only about 54k of TPA).
I was able to get it to go only by using a particular compiler, which isn't
all that common.

   There were several reasons why I didn't release the sources with zmp in
the first place: mostly, I guess, I didn't want 156 different versions of
zmp floating around (we all learned an awful lot from SD!). In these days
of PCs, Macs and "shareware", I'm more worried about someone else making
money from my code (and, of course, that of Hal Maney, who wrote Hmodem,
from which [r]zmp was derived). Perhaps releasing it all under the GPL will
help: has anyone got any suggestions on this? (Please note that any Windows
port of zmp will be released under much the same conditions as cp/m zmp was:
free to non-commercial users).

   The Zmodem specs, which you should try and get if you intend to write a
program using Zmodem, are probably in Simtel-20's zmodem directory. Try
"yzmodem.arc" and possibly "zmodem810.zip" as well.

> JMODEM would be even better...

   You may have problems with jmodem in a cp/m environment. If memory serves
me right (it's been a long time, and I don't have the docs with me), it's
basically xmodem with an impossibly large (for cp/m) packet size: up to about
14k, I believe. (The Zmodem-like protocol in Fidonet mail systems has a similar
problem, in case you wonder why I never added that capability to Foodo). It
wasn't possible to add jmodem to zmp for this reason: simple lack of memory.
(You may notice that zmp receives files in chunks of up to 16k: if these
chunks are less than 16k, then that's all the memory you have free in your
system with zmp running). It may be possible to get jmodem running by
re-coding the whole lot in assembler, or cutting down on other things, but
the real question is: why bother? Zmodem is probably more efficient under
all but the best conditions.

Message-ID: <3BuauB2w165w@netlink.cts.com>

Here's a bit of a teaser for anyone who wants to play the game.

I have a Kaypro 10 machine with the 10Mb drive installed.  Because of 
(apparently) magnetics in the area, the format for the second partition 
is nearly lost (as is all data).

Question:  Does anyone know of a PD or shareware program to help me 
rebuild the format/partition?  It's little use to have a 400k partition 
on a 10 meg drive, and I can't find a replacement drive for less than a 
can of soda.

Thanks.

Well, Charles, now that I've dried all the tears from my eyes and can see 
what I'm doing again ...

I own a Kaypro 10 (which I'll be posting about shortly), and I seem to 
remember that there is a program to print graphics with CP/M.  While I 
can't remember ever using it, I do browse the local graveyards here once 
in a while.

You might try writing your own program in, say, S-Basic (came with my 
machine), or in C using some of the DOS C routines for GIFs (again 
noticed while browsing local boards).  The GIF structure is fairly simple 
once you understand how the compression algorhythm works.  You could, 
then, replace the palette with patterns, one for each major color, and 
send the whole lot to the printer.

A program written for the Commodore 64 and the Gemini 10x is still around 
somewhere (I have a copy of the compiled program, not the source).  It's 
called ShadeyDump, and converts any Commodore graphic (bitmapped with 
separate palette of three selectable colors) to a pseudo-dithered 
monochrome file ready for printing.  The program was featured in one of 
the Commodore magazines and should be easily translated to S-Basic or C.

(I hear you snickering over there when I say Commodore, so STOP IT!!)

I hope this helps.  If I see something on a local board I'll mail it to 
you.

Tom

This sounds as the same problem the Macintosh community has with Borland's
Reflex database.

But perhaps some of you know that Borland _bought_ Turbo Pascal from a Danish
company called PolyData. While Borland was selling the compiler under the
name "Turbo Pascal" in the USA and elsewhere, it what still being sold in
Denmark as COMPAS Pascal. Borland furnished it with a better (WordStar-like)
Editor, which eventually appeared in COMPAS Pascal version 3.
(I still prefer the extremely simple editor in COMPAS Pascal v.2.20 ;-)
COMPAS Pascal was also available for CP/M-86 and Concurrent-CP/M.
(It was popular in the late 80's for use with the Regnecentralen Piccoline
computers -- with the 80186 CPU -- used at many schools in Denmark.)

Maybe it is worth investigating whether PolyData still holds the rights on
COMPAS Pascal?

Subject: Uniform Upgrade

When I recently upgraded to MS-DOS 5.0, I discovered out that my versions
of Uniform and Unidos no longer worked. Uniform is a program that allows
a PC to read CP/M disks. Unidos enables the PC to run CP/M software. Both
are produced by MicroSolutions, Inc.

I called the company and was informed that new releases of Uniform and
Unidos do run under MS-DOS 5.0. All that I had to do was send in a very
reasonable $15 upgrade fee, plus $2 shipping and handling, along with the
original software disk.

Within 10 days I received the upgrade disk in the mail. After reinstalling
the software on my system, I am happy to report that it works great!  The
new version of Uniform contains even more CP/M formats than the old one.
Here's the address and telephone number for Microsolutions, Inc.

If you're refering to the Sirius/Victor 9000, it was an 8086 based, non-IBM PC
compatible computer that ran both CP/M 86 and MS-DOS.  If you don't actually
have access to a Sirius, reading the disks can be a problem as they used
variable speed drives (fitting 600k+ onto a  SSDD 5.25 disk).  Best solution,
find someone with both a sirius and another PC and transfer the files by serial
cable. (I have access to such a setup, but I'm a tad far away to be useful :-) )

IUP (Indiana University of Pennsylvania) had a _really_ niffty color
graphic monitor.  It was made by a company called Vectrix.  It
connected to the parallel printer port and had its own Z80 processor
(intelligent peripherals - imagine that! :-)).  It was controlled by

     Turbo-Pascal 3.0x was available for CP/M-86 too.  There were also
     separate MS-DOS and PC-DOS versions.  The MS-DOS version could
     be configured for serial terminals in the same way as the CP/M
     and CP/M-86.

     theories that other MD's (I'm one) have come-up with is the levels of (female 
and male) hormones that circulate in the mother (and hence get to the fetus) 
may affect the baby in this way. How the mother responds to stress in her life 
will determine the hormones that she produces. And everyone has bothe types of 
hormones circulating in their body (estrogrens and testosterone).
>> As for the "precious gift of God..." If it wasn't for Christianity, the 
human race would not have the problems that it does in dealing with 
homosexuality. Every enlighted person knows that Christianity was an opiate 
created to oppress the masses and that is exactly what it has done for nearly 
2,000 years! Just look at all the hypocrisy in the beloved church itself - they
preach against homosexuality, etc - yet priests are regularly accused of child 
molestations, infidelity (breaking the celibate laws), homosexuality with other
priests,etc....

   Lasse Hiller|e Petersen's information about the origin of Turbo Pascal
was very interesting; I had not heard that before.  I remember talk about
origins of Turbo Pascal in France, where Philippe Kahn grew up, I
understand.  This was the first I heard of a Danish connection.  It would be
interesting to see if there would be another avenue to get some rights to
the code.

   I normally speak out against pirating commercial software (and not only
because I am a developer myself), but in situations like this -- where the
person who wants the software is offering payment but the payment is refused
by the producer -- I say nothing against disks being passed around. 
Probably Borland does not even mind that.  These big companies, I am told,
worry about legal entanglements in connection with offering the software for
sale but not supporting it, or even from giving it away.

  "Welcome to MUSE" contains all information pertinent to version 4.01
  of the MUSE Operating System... It is assumed that you are familiar with
  computer basics and the CP/M Operating System... The Multi-User System

Message-ID: <BxtyKD.EEy@lut.fi>

Yes, I just received againa new piece of interesting hardware, a
Televideo 806/20 and a "computer/terminal" TS800A.
It has a 19Mb hardie.

The problem is connecting the computerm to the "server". Need to make
the cable.

If you have any knowlidge or info on this system, please contact me
by email. You could in your first mail include some descriptions on 
the OS (cpm-80, MmmOST, cpm-86 etc. features, putting it to multiusers
mode ....)

Thanks

Yes, I have just acquired one of these machines.  It reminds of high school.
And the problem is I would like to be able to read and write to the machine
so I can download programs to the machine (I don't have a terminal program,
nothing for the machine.  I haven't yet found anyone locally with the programs
yet (just started), so I am floating my request for help on the net.
Also, what about CPM for the machine (its a ModelIII w/h 64k and the double
drives.)

Thanks a lot,

Welcome to MYZ80!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
MYZ80 is a Z80/64180 emulator package. It was written to allow you 
to finally get rid of those old Z80 computers which have done so 
many fine years of service. The new 80386 machines with the fast 
hard drives and the snazzy OS/2 operating systems are such a 
delight... but for many, the Z80 machines still have to be fired 
up from to time in order to develop code for CP/M and the Z80 
chip. Well, not any more, thanks to MYZ80.

Other emulators on the market are less than satisfactory 
solutions. Of the small number which can actually run without 
causing system errors under the later versions of DOS, apparently 
none are capable of running real CP/M. Instead they use an 
emulated version of CP/M which is only as accurate as the 
developers have bothered to make it.

None can run CP/M 3.0, and none can run ZCPR (which is such a 
useful Z80 developer's environment). Add to that their less than 
perfect Z80 emulation and slow overall performance, and until 
MYZ80, the 'real' Z80 machines were destined to remain in the 
office.

MYZ80 provides the solution being conceived, born and nurtured to 
the point where it is now the most useful Z80 emulator package 
ever!


MYZ80 features.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
MYZ80 emulates the instruction set of the 8080, Z80 and Z180/64180 
CPU chips. It does this with the "MicroFast Z80 Emulation Engine" 
which is a very highly tuned piece of code designed to be as fast 
and as accurate as technically possible on 80286, 80386 and 80486 
CPUs.

MYZ80 provides an interface (the MYZ80 API) to the host computer 
which allows real Z80 BDOSes to run in the MYZ80 environment. This 
interface provides disk and character I/O as well as two banks of 
64k RAM (with common area) and a large RAM disk. These unique 
features allow MYZ80 to run 'real' CP/M 2.2, CP/M 3.0, Z-System 
and ZPM3.

MYZ80 is designed for the latest multitasking operating systems 
and makes Z80 programs 'host friendly'. MYZ80 will share time very 
fairly with the host. Even multiple instances of MYZ80 are 
supported.

MYZ80 can take advantage of the latest computer hardware for 
increased performance. The Microfast Z80 Emulation Engine operates 
in either 16 (80286) or 32 (80386/80486) bit mode depending on the 
capabilities of the host computer.

MYZ80 runs beautifully on IBM AT compatible (or better) computers 
under DOS 3.3 compatible (or later) operating systems. This 
includes running under OS/2 2.0, Desqview, and Windows 3.x.


Starting MYZ80.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
MYZ80 is started from the DOS command line by simply typing the 
name of its executable (CPM). However, advanced users may wish to 
include optional arguments on the command line.

The first argument is the name of a boot file to be used instead 
of the default (BOOT.CPM), and following arguments are saved by 
MYZ80 and may be retrieved from within the MYZ80 environment.

MYZ80 always looks for its support files in the directory it 
resides in. Therefore, you may start MYZ80 from any directory or 
disk, and it will always find its support files (as long as they 
are in the same directory as CPM.EXE).

MYZ80 may be run from a floppy disk (although a hard disk is 
recommended). To do so, put CPM.EXE and the support files onto the 
floppy disk, and start the program.


Leaving MYZ80.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
There are two ways to exit from the MYZ80 environment. You may 
select the 'Abort and exit' choice from the pause box menu, or you 
may run the MYZ80 utility QUIT.COM. The latter method also allows 
you to specify an error level to return to DOS with (for use in 
batch files).


Further information.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Some explanations of the terms used above and further information 
will be displayed to you when you start MYZ80 for the first time. 
Legal information is provided in the file READ.1ST which was 
supplied with this package. All the MYZ80 utilities have online 
help. Other support files for MYZ80 should be provided in the 
future and will probably be available from the place where you 
found this package.


The version of MYZ80 that you have now may not be perfect, but it 
is pretty close! It has been released so that as many people as 
possible can join the MYZ80 revolution, and keep CP/M and Z80 
alive for years to come. Please enjoy it.



Simeon Cran.

Radio Shack sells a little RS-232 tester for under $20 which could show if
your Kaypro is putting out the proper signals.  It's about the size of a
null-modem adapter, with seven two-color LEDs on it.  You can leave it plugged
into the computer for neat-looking blinky lights.  By the way, does your
modem have lights?  Do any of them light up when it's connected to the Kaypro?
It's possible you could have damaged the modem by plugging it into the Amiga
with power on (making a squelching noise?).  You could also damage the Amiga.
If you use the same modem with two computers,  you should get an A/B switch.

Yep, Wang Office Assistant, primarily a dedicated Word Processor, used a
80186 CPU, I repaired those boxes back in '85 -'86  not very exciting,
they did have some packages other than Wordprocessing, incl. spreadsheet and
communications packages, sorry, it didnt support MS-DOS or other 'known'
operating systems. If I remember correctly, the WOA-20 had a 360k floppy 
and a WOA-40 incl a 10 MB h/disk  and were sold with a printer eg Diablo.
You could use it for parts, or rip the m/bd out and buy more suitable
m/bd.

Subject: TRS-80 to MSDOS....
Message-ID: <9211030047.AA19081@st6000.sct.edu>

hi,

   As far as I know, the Model 4/4D/4P will run CP/M without any other
modifications, as opposed to at least the Model III which I'm aware of
which requires a hardware board....forgot who makes it....

   Anyway, theres a program/utility called supercross XT or something
of that nature which allows you to read and write other operating systems
including MSDOS but this runs under the MOdel III operating system and
Model 4 Trsdos.....
 
   For CP/M, there's a customized CP/M called Montezuma Micro CP/M
which comes with a system configuration program which allows you to read
, write and format different kinds of CP/M disks on your model 4 and it
also takes into consideration what kind of floppy you have, single sided,
double sided, quad density (80 track), etc....
   By the way, this is CP/M 2.2 which is far superior to Radio Shack's
 CP/M 3.0......and also available (don't know where you can find it these
days ) for this CP/M is "Monte's Toolkit" which includes disk formating
and reading utilities, including a virtual file utility for moving files
between CP/M, TRSDOS, or MSDOS.....

  As for the latter program, Supercross XT, I believe there was also an
Ibm/tandy version which allowed you to read TRS-80 disks on a DOS machine...

  The CP/M 2.2 is still currently available from a company somewhere......
the information escapes me at the moment, but I know places that still sell
TRS-80 Software and hardware


   current updated stuff available for this defunct line of computers are:
 
  mouse
  3 1/2" floppies
  realtime clocks
  conversion for gif files to TRS-80 high res-graphics board format
  mouse to keyboard interface
  mouse drivers...
  external drive modification using the 50 pin rear connector


  I myself have (my original computer), a TRS-80 4P, non-gate array,
 128k, high-res graphics card, and other hardware modifications...

  As far as communications programs, there's quite a bit in public
domain, including XModem and Kermit standalone programs....

Subject: Kermit for Cromemco's
Message-ID: <1992Nov2.133932.12562@ee.rochester.edu>

Hi all.

We have a few Cromemco CS-1 computers running CDOS/CPM and some local, 10
year old, communications software.  The University has changed the
communications structure and this software is now flaky at best.  We
would like to run some version of kermit so that atleast we have standard
software and documentation as to its functionality.

These Cromemco computers only have floppy drives and serial ports so
thatwe are limited how we can obtain software.  When I contacted
Columbia they could ship us the version for our machine but not on media
that we can use.

My question is, does any one have kermit for a cromemco CS-1 that I can
get/buy/whatever on a 5 1/4 inch floppy?  Any other suggestions would
greatly be appreciated also.

This can be handled with 22DISK, at least version 1.30 or better; use
the SOFS parameter instead of OFS.  From the manual:

       SOFS  indicates the number of sectors that are  used  for  storing
            the  CP/M  system  and  BIOS at the beginning of a diskette.
            SOFS is used when the number of sectors used by the CP/M  is
            not  an  integral  number of tracks,  such as for the Coleco
            Adam.

All Kaypro CPM machines use the telephone cable. You can use or borrow the
cable from any telephone handset. If your machine is dysfunctional, the
problem lies elsewhere.

Subject: What is MYZ80?
Message-ID: <VikDTB2w164w@naos.actrix.gen.nz>

I've received a number of email messages asking what MyZ80 is, and what
it does.  I didn't post this in my last message because there had been
some discussion recently.  To answer the question, here's a bit of the
documentation file...

--- cut here --- cut here --- cut here ---
                            M Y Z 8 0
                            =========

                         by Simeon Cran.

Welcome to MYZ80!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
MYZ80 is a Z80/64180 emulator package. It was written to allow you 
to finally get rid of those old Z80 computers which have done so 
many fine years of service. The new 80386 machines with the fast 
hard drives and the snazzy OS/2 operating systems are such a 
delight... but for many, the Z80 machines still have to be fired 
up from to time in order to develop code for CP/M and the Z80 
chip. Well, not any more, thanks to MYZ80.

Other emulators on the market are less than satisfactory 
solutions. Of the small number which can actually run without 
causing system errors under the later versions of DOS, apparently 
none are capable of running real CP/M. Instead they use an 
emulated version of CP/M which is only as accurate as the 
developers have bothered to make it.

None can run CP/M 3.0, and none can run ZCPR (which is such a 
useful Z80 developer's environment). Add to that their less than 
perfect Z80 emulation and slow overall performance, and until 
MYZ80, the 'real' Z80 machines were destined to remain in the 
office.

MYZ80 provides the solution being conceived, born and nurtured to 
the point where it is now the most useful Z80 emulator package 
ever!

MYZ80 features.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
MYZ80 emulates the instruction set of the 8080, Z80 and Z180/64180 
CPU chips. It does this with the "MicroFast Z80 Emulation Engine" 
which is a very highly tuned piece of code designed to be as fast 
and as accurate as technically possible on 80286, 80386 and 80486 
CPUs.

MYZ80 provides an interface (the MYZ80 API) to the host computer 
which allows real Z80 BDOSes to run in the MYZ80 environment. This 
interface provides disk and character I/O as well as two banks of 
64k RAM (with common area) and a large RAM disk. These unique 
features allow MYZ80 to run 'real' CP/M 2.2, CP/M 3.0, Z-System 
and ZPM3.

MYZ80 is designed for the latest multitasking operating systems 
and makes Z80 programs 'host friendly'. MYZ80 will share time very 
fairly with the host. Even multiple instances of MYZ80 are 
supported.

MYZ80 can take advantage of the latest computer hardware for 
increased performance. The Microfast Z80 Emulation Engine operates 
in either 16 (80286) or 32 (80386/80486) bit mode depending on the 
capabilities of the host computer.

MYZ80 runs beautifully on IBM AT compatible (or better) computers 
under DOS 3.3 compatible (or later) operating systems. This 
includes running under OS/2 2.0, Desqview, and Windows 3.x.

And a little bit detailing the system requirements, from the readme
file.

--- cut here --- cut here --- cut here ---
                       System Requirements.
                       ====================

For MYZ80 to work at all it needs:
IBM AT compatible (or better)
300k free RAM
DOS 3.3 or later
Disk drive

MYZ80 can also make good use of the following system  resources if 
available (None of these is required to get  good performance  out 
of MYZ80):
Hard disk drive
More than 300k free RAM
DOS 5.00
XMS memory
Multi-tasker (such as OS/2 2.x, Desqview or Windows 3.x)
32 bit CPU (80386,80486)
--- cut here --- cut here --- cut here ---

MyZ80 does meet it's claims, at least for me.  I'm running it on a
286/10, and the emulated environment is almost as fast as a 3/4Mhz Z80
running native.  On a faster machine, it'd be amazing to use.

To repeat the bit from the previous post; the latest version of MyZ80 is
version 1.03.  I've received several "where can I get it requests".
Because the only site I know that it is definitely on is a long way off
the net and pays for all traffic both incomming and outgoing, I don't
want to post the site address.  Please if I've emailed you the address
and you've retrieved it, would you _please_ upload it to some of the
bigger archive sites (could someone post a message when they've uploaded
it to Simtel, eg).  Thank you.

I think you might have a little trouble with the ICL Quattro.
I vaguely remember when I tried it that the number of reserved tracks was
not an integer, so the directory started partway into a track. No software
I could find could cope with this.

Modems are not supposed to be _powered_ from the serial port. The Amiga does
provide +12V power for external devices, but this is not _standard_ behavior.
The only thing modems are supposed to take from the serial port are modem
signals.

You should check out HMODEM-II which ZMP and RZMP were based upon. It
comes with source in C. As to Jmodem, source has always been available
for that one. Both in C and in ASM.

This was not very widely spread, but I once knew a fellow that had this
eprom on his TS-803... it even came with special key caps. The product
was a third-party add-on.

Also, related info: there was a product from Digital Engineering in
Sacramento, (916) 447-7600 that gave the TeleVideo 910, 912, 920, 925
and 950 Tektronix 4027 and 4010 emulation... also Selanar Graphics in
Santa Clara, (408) 727-2811 offered a similar product.

Sorry to say that I can't tell you who had the WordStar modification for
these units though.

BTW, WordStar has no problem with these terminals, except that the
control commands are different than produced by the editing keys, so you
have to use the ctrl-key, as per normal for WordStar on most machines.

There is also PC-CRoss-Zap, which runs under MS-DOS on the PC, and 
is supplied by Hypersoft at:

    PO Box 51155, Raleigh, NC 27609 USA

They also make Hypercross which runs on the Model III and allows
you to read-write, under TRS-80 operating systems, PC and CP/M 
disks.

There are memory-mapped versions of some software, e.g. Wordstar

You shouldn't need a mod for the Model III, which is built to take 
two internal and two external drives. It's the Model 4P that has 
to be modified to take more than two drives.

Message-ID: <1992Nov3.235318.24843@tdb.uu.se>

Hello CP/M world and lovers!

Does anyone know if there is a CP/M emulator for the Macintosh?
Or maybe any source-code to port? I would like to hear about it
if there is...

All I have seen so far is for MS/DOS or UNIX.

I do got a swedish CP/P comuter called JET-80, but my desk-top
is not large enough for the MAC QUADRA and the JET-80 :-(

I hope there is a solution to this...

I now have MYZ80 (demo) up and running and am very happy.  However I got off
SIMTEL the Forth programming language package Uniforth and got it to give
myz80 trouble.  When I went to edit a screen I was given a invalide instruction
error.  I don't have it were with me so I can't give you the code.  I hope this
helps in futher revisions of myz80.  I love my old ADAM CP/M but I have to face
the facts; myz80 is faster (about 5X or better) on my 486 33Mhz, and is easier
to use as far as transportability goes.  I will still fire up my ADAM but out
of respect for the years it carried me through college.  I used Uniforth for
years with no problems on my ADAM and if this problem gets fixed I will
register asap.  Thank you MYZ80-master!!!

Hi, I'm looking for a reasonable C compiler for my old MAX-80.
Either a native compiler, or a cross compiler that I can

Is there anyone else out there who has a MAX-80 from Lobo Systems?

	Well, the "5 volts" was supplied by a friend of mine who may or may
not know what he's talking about, but certainly knows more than me.  What I
meant to say is that, whatever the voltage is, it's not putting out the right
kind of juice.
	I have a Hayes compatible modem which, when I plug it into my Amiga,
makes a sort of "squelch", indicating that the serial is supplying it with
eliectricity.  It does no such thing when I plug it into the Kaypro, and,
not surprisingly, does not respond to Hayes-commands (ATH0, etc.).  It just
sits there.
	Parting from this, I'll rephrase my original question:

	IS the +/- 9v output in the Kaypro a sufficient standard to assume
that my Amiga puts out the same quantity?  If this is so, then the serial
on the Kaypro IS damaged, as the modem receives no power.

	You've probably noticed by now that I don't have a voltage meter.
I know it's gauche to use a hayes-comp. as a meter (or LED) for my serial
ports, but hey...  :-)

Two public domain C compilers I know of are Small-C (the DDJ version), and
Micro-C.  Small-C is available at SIMTEL-20 (in the CPM.SMALLC21 directory)
and I forget where I got Micro-C (look for MC132 with archie).  I do know
the version I ftp'd had a critical file corrupted so it was useless for
Z80 code.  If I find a good version I'll post a note here.

Subject: Re: 5v out serial port
Message-ID: <JOT.92Oct30114120@teak09.cray.com>

The RS-232 standard, defines a "mark" as a voltage between +3V and
+12V; a "space" as a voltage between -12V and -3V (or, just possibly,
the other way around.)  (And just maybe 15V, not 12V?)  Notice that 0V
doesn't "mean" anything.

However, folks noticed that 0V and +5V would "operate" many modems,
even though it shouldn't.

If you are seeing 0V and +5V, you are probably trying to plug directly
into the UART, which is maybe not the best thing in the world to do;
it was intended that there be some sort of line driver between the
UART and the rest of the world.  I would not care to guess what
happens to one of those chips if it is connected to a modem which
applies -12V to the input.

Read this one with interest, in the UK the Amstrad PCW range (CP/M based) still
selling well. Magazines still published to support it, together with huge range of application software and GAMES.

I don't have one myself, although do still own a CP/M machine, that also runs 
UNPLUS System III Unix on a 68000 co-processor board.

Hope this of interest, if you would like details of the magazine then drop me 
a note and I will get them from newsagent next time i visit.

I think NEC built one. And then there's the MSX crowd in Japan (although
a Japanese foreign-exchange student just laughed when I mentioned MSX). I've
also seen a color Sony machine.

If, by dead, you mean not covered by the mainstream press, yes. If, by dead,
you mean that nothing is available, no. If, by dead, you mean no one is doing
anything with it, no.

Speaking of which, does anyone have manuals for CP/NET? I'm interested
in the System Alteration Guide.

Hello !
I just got a Z80 CP/M computer from a friend.
I has a to floppy drives. Comes with a system disk, and a copy of 
WordStar. Well it was interest messing around with this computer, and 
now I want to know more!

This is what I would like to find out:

Where there ever any CP/M computers with a moniter other than mono?

Could somebody tell me where I can find games and other programs for this 
thing? FTP's?

Is the the CP/M Market dead? 

Does anybody have a CP/M system manual on file?

Well that is about it for now, thanks!

I remember seeing ads for graphics boards running on the S-100 bus, and
thus usable by a Z-80 board on the bus running CP/M.  The only company
name I can think of right now is Cromeco.  Ahhh!  Back in the good old
days - when power supplies doubled as arc welders, and portable meant
that you could transport the computer without having to use a truck. (-:

There was a color graphics board for CP/M Kaypros -- I know -- I have
one that I bought from one of the engineers that designed it.  It was
made by MicroSphere.  It uses the Texas Instruments TI-9918A chip,
which gives 256x192 resolution, 16 colors and 32 sprites.  This is the
same chip that a lot of game machines and early micro computers used,
like the Texas Instruments TI99.

I had started writing a set of procedures for it with Turbo Modula 2,
but I have not found the time to finish it.

I also remember reading about a color graphics board that plugged into
a standard Centronics parallel port, so you drive it from virtually any
computer.  I think I saw this back in '86 or '87.  I don't remember
what company made it.

MIX-C was manufactured and sold by MIX Software, Richardson, Texas,
1-800-333-0330, for about 20$, with a 300 hundred pages documentation
included. Yes I am definitely talking about MIX-C for CP/M-80. No I am not
talking about Power-C for MESSDOSS which they continuously advertise (Ok, I
own, use and warmly praise both).
I will be glad to sell my CP/M-80 copy for 100$ or  more if and only if:
a) MIX C stills sells it and for 20$.
b) MIX C explicitly agrees with that deal.
In spite of the induced headache, I would certainly do that for any colleague
in search of a copy about as old as her/his computer .... ,-}

If and only if MIX Software or their legal representatives issue a clear and
unambiguous statement of complete loss of interest, I will gladly upload
my copy for public usage. The documentation will remain a problem.

I've been trying out myz80 and it's very impressive. But there's 
one problem: I can't get CP/M Kermit to work with it. I have to 
use serial port 2 for DOS communications (mouse on port 1), so I 
wondered whether the emulator can use a serial port, whether it 
uses port 1 by default, and if so whether there's any means of 
making it use port 2 instead. I couldn't find anything about this 
in the docs that came with the trial version. Does anyone know the 
answer?

You just found out that real numbers are not handled by your compiler.
So what about buying MIX-C once for all for 20$?
I do not have any interest with MIX software, I just repeat from my experience,
pay these 20$ and begin to ENJOY programming in C with your beloved computer,
instead of limiting yourself with a compiler which IS a beautiful thing, for
which Mr. Hendrix deserves our eternal gratitude, a C compiler written in C,
with all the sources available, etc, etc, a superb laboratory/demonstration
object, written for that purpose, but definitely not to write APPLICATIONS.
If you read the articles in DDJ that came with the compiler, and/or Hendrix's
****excellent**** book on the compiler and library, you will see that the
exclusion of the REAL type was deliberate.
When you begin using MIX-C @ 20$ instead, you will also be amazed by the
ratio of elapsed time needed to compile and build the .COM file, not only
because of the intermediate assembly in Small C.
I don't wish to be flamed as if I was denying the extraordinary qualities
of Small C, including its null price (not quite, if you need the books and
the Microsoft M-80 assembler, although I know that NOW there are free almost
compatible assemblers, which PERHAPS correctly assemble ANY code generated
by Small-C).
I just warmly suggest to APPLICATIONS programmers to save a lot of headache
for 20$ only.
If MIX doesn't send me a new copy of the compiler which I anyway already have
after such a post ....

Hi!
My name is Chuck Stewart, and I'm the person who posted an
article trying to sell my Kaypro-4 on this newsgroup awhile back.
To all those who responded; Thank you!
I'm sorry I'm so late getting back to you all, but things got
strange around here again...:}
It seems that I will not be able to sell the Kaypro for enough to
get even a start on a used 8086, so I will have to do the best I
can with it.
To do so I will need to talk with the modern world, and that
requires VT100 or ANSI emulation instead of VT52. I asked about
this awhile back and someone mentioned   (QTerm)? (4xx)?
Does anyone know if this is it, and if it is; where can I get it?
I would be extremely grateful for any information I can receive!

Subject: Need system disks for TRS-80 Model 4P
Message-ID: <1dmgmbINN1mt@agate.berkeley.edu>

I've adopted another orphan.  This time it's a TRS-80 Model 4P.
Unfortunately, the system disks that I got with the machine are
trashed.  Therefore I'm looking for...

A TRSDOS 6 boot disk (with appropriate utilities) for running in
model 4 mode.

An earlier TRSDOS boot disk (for running in Model 3 mode).

and

A CP/M system disk (with the transient commands) for running CP/M.

I will, of course, pay media and shipping costs.

Now if I could just find someone willing to sell me a Model 16
for the same price, my "orphan museum" would be off to a good start.

UniForm does not seem to run anymore on recent MSDOS versions. It was of 
questionable use anyway, at least not generally usable, since it was not 
configurable to arbitrary formats. This is both unfortunate because its 
concept of installing virtual drives instead of implementing copy commands 
was certainly the nicer one.
Dan Fandrich recently announced a new program to install virtual drives

it doesn't seem to have been released yet.

I don't specifically know what versions are available, but try
watsun.cc.columbia.edu (128.59.39.1) for anonymous FTP.  It is the official

BDS C, one of the best CP/M C compilers is still on the market, and is
quite reasonably priced, I believe.  It's currently marketed and
supported by Jay Sage of Sage Microsystems East.  You can reach him on
his BBS at 617-965-7259 (password "DDT") or by voice at 617-569-3552,
call about 10 Eastern time.  BDS C is a nearly complete K&R
implementation which makes fairly tight code and was the leader of the
pack at one point in speed benchmarks.

Floating point conversion is a complex business and not easily
implemented on 8080 or Z80 based machines.  Even commercial C compilers
such as BDS C implemented floating point arithmetic via special
functions which were included in an add-on floating point library.
Programs which I wrote using floating point arithmetic ususally handled
floating point numbers as strings which were I/O'd with %s rather than
%f.  There may be floating point libraries around for small C.  This is
certainly the place to advirtise for them.  Another source of
information, or so I'm told, is the CP/M echo of FidoNet which is
reportedly a good deal more active than this one.

I received a message from Simeon Cran on fidonet that addressed
this issue. Polled serial I/O can be done by direct access to the
UART's at 3f8-3fe and 2f8-2fe (i.e. COM1 & COM2). These port
addresses in the 8088's I/O space map to ports 00-06 and 08-0e (or
10-16) in the Z80's I/O space. I can't remember the port addresses
for COM2, but they're there.

You'll need to know the details of how to talk to an 8250, but
there's any amount of reference material available on that
subject.

The next version (1.03) also includes BIOS/FOSSIL serial support,
although I don't have the details of that here.

 The 4P will also read an Osborne format (185K capacity).  There is also
a Zenith format (152K or 156K) that should work..

My experience with MicroSolutions has been that they are helpful and
responsive to tech problems.  If you are having trouble with UniForm,
you should contact them as I'm sure they keep up to date with DOS
version updates and issue updates of UniForm in response.  Although I
use and recommend 22DISK myself, I've had at least one professional CP/M
software distrbutor (thankfully, this is not yet an oxymoron) tell me
that UniForm is the more reliable of the two.

MicroSolutions runs a BBS at 815-756-9100 in the US.

There is an obscure support department at Tandy called "Tandy Software
Assembly".  Most Radio Shack employees don't know about it because they
don't read the employee manual.  Anyway, if you don't have any luck with
your post, and you can round up the original catalog numbers of the items
you need, get a Tandy employee to call this department and order it for
you.  Last I heard, you can get copies of disks, replacements, etc., for
$7.00 per disk.

Congrat's on the TRS-80 4P.  May I suggest a subscription to Computer 
News 80 magazine.  This magazine contains all the DOS's you're looking
for, and MUCH more.  It's only $24 a year and is distributed monthly.
When you order a Model 3 boot disk, be sure that it includes the file
MODELA/III.  This file is a software ROM, as the 4P has no built in ROM, 
as the rest of the Model 4 family has.
    If you're a member on GEnie, stop by the Tandy RT as we boast several
files for the Models 1/3/4 there!  CN80 magazine also provides a 
download-through-the-mail service for nominal charges.

The Fido Cpm echo has about 15- 20 messages a day
 Do anyone know where a list of Cp/m os disk are?

Subject: 22DISK problem with trs-80 4p
Message-ID: <10NOV199219471721@zeus.tamu.edu>

I have a trs-80 model 4p and and 486/clone. I have been getting software
of the net for the 4p but its all on my pc. So i got 22disk to hopefully
write all this good stuff to my model 4's cpm disks.
Unforunately, 22disk doesn't (seem) to support my version of cpm.
I think its cpm plus 3.0 : according to anadisk it has a 2:1 interleave
and sector ids 0-17 and 256 byte sectors.

Can anyone tell me how to get this format working with 22disk?

thanks, jason.

Hi There!

Here's an interesting question:
My Kaypro-4 , of course , cannot handle graphics.
I cannot afford a new computer for a long time. I must make do with the Kaypro.
So. I am an anime fan and I would like to PRINT OUT GIF's. (Stop laughiing!
You! In the corner! Stop laughing!  ;)
Has anyone ever written a program for a Kaypro-4 to
PRINT Gif's on a dot matrix printer? 
I have an Epson RX-80.
Please stop giggling; you're making the Kaaypro nervous...:)

Subject: cp/m - dos conversion
Message-ID: <CMM.0.90.4.721524833.ephillip@magnus.acs.ohio-state.edu>

For quite a while, I have struggled with the problem of converting
all my old CP/M stuff to my dos computer, as many of you have (evident
by the number of messages on the subject!). I have finally succeeded.
While there are many programs out there that simulate the cp/m-os
on dos, they either lacked the ability to directly read/write a
cp/m formatted disk, or you were forced to use the old modem
technique to get the files into your dos. No More! I have discovered
a company called "Intersecting Concepts", @ 30851 Agoura Rd,
Suite 200, Agoura Hills, Ca 91301 ph:818-879-0086. They have
produced a product called "Media Master" which runs flawlessly
on my IBM-PC AT 286 w/dos v.5 that logs in my a:floppy drive
as a Morrow MD-2 (SSDD) (which was one of my old cp/m machines).
It will also log in many other 5-1/4" cp/m disk formats, up to
I think close to 70 of 'em! You can then directly read/write the
cp/m floppy disk, copying all of the files if you wish onto your
dos machine's harddrive. Then, Media Master has a cp/m-os emulator,
called "ZP/EM" which runs the cp/m software! Of course, the program
"myz80" does this well too, but Media Master is one program that
does everything in one package, negating the need to run 2 or
more pieces of software just to run cp/m on dos. BTW, all of the
standard disclaimers apply re:my working for them or getting
financial consideration from the (I don't!). I just finally found
something that works after more than 2 years of searching. Man,
it's just like sitting at the console of my old Morrow! Absolutely
seamless, I tell ya! Hope this helps all of you looking for a
solution. BTW, the price? Just about $70 bucks, ups'ed to your
door!

UniForm does not seem to run anymore on recent MSDOS versions. It was of 
questionable use anyway, at least not generally usable, since it was not 
configurable to arbitrary formats. This is both unfortunate because its 
concept of installing virtual drives instead of implementing copy commands 
was certainly the nicer one.
Dan Fandrich recently announced a new program to install virtual drives 
handling CP/M disks (if I understood him right), but - again unfortunately - 
it doesn't seem to have been released yet.

I hope someone can help Chris find a Hard drive.  They do exist, but
I don't know where.  2 MB RAM disks also exist with Batter backup,
which is a good way to go.  I still use the two-disk drive system.
Tomorrow I'll bring the address of the EPSON usre's group in

The Apple Lisa was, simplistically, a product ahead of its time. One might 
say that it was the first Macintosh. In fact, a number of them were sold in 
the late 1980's as a cheap machine which would run Mac software.

I suggest that you seek a Macintosh forum in which to ask further questions.

and the 6128 machines are color too.  Amstrad have just launched a new Z80 based
notebook although I don't think it runs CP/M.   It was reviewed recently in
Byte under the comment "last Z80 machine ?",  we'll see.  The Tatung Einstein
was also a color CP/M machine, although the color monitor only supported
40 columns.

  Hello Guys

  I have worked for a year and a half on QX-10 and 16 before leaving the 
school where I was teaching.  At that time, I gave away 3 QX-10, 2 QX-16
2 20 Mb hard disks and all the original technical documentation.  Had to do
that as I was leaving the country and could not afford to take them along.
  In the US, I enquired about QXs for the good times sakes, and came up
with those two addresses:

   Star Technology Corporation
   900 Road 170
   Carbondale, CO 81623     (303)963-1969

     I found their prices much too high ( $679 for a 20 Mb, 65 ms 
   hard disk )

   SnyderScope International
   1594 Hilltop Drive
   El Cajon, CA 92020-8227  (619)442-2299

     SnyderScope was in the process of closing its QX interests in 1991, so
   I don't know if they might be of help.  They might be kind and give you
   a few tips on how to hack a QX to MFM or RLL interface so that you can 
   use a regular DOS drive.

  Happy hacking

Call MISOSYS (1-800-misosys) and buy LS-DOS 6.3.1.  Model 4 TRSDOS 6

suggest getting LDOS 5.3.1 from MISOSYS.  It works almost exactly like
LS-DOS, but in Model 3 mode.  It blows TRSDOS 1.3 out of the water.
(some Model 3 software will only run under TRSDOS 1.3, though).

I believe Computer News 80 has Montezuma Micro CPM 2.2.  This is your
best bet.  Radio Shack CPM was based on CPM version 3.0.  I've heard
a lot of complaints about the Radio Shack port of it (never used it myself).

Lindsay Haisley was kind in mentioning me as a source for BDS C, but there
were two inaccuracies that should be corrected.  First, Sage Microsystems
East is my wife's company.  They carry all the products I like, and I am
happy to provide technical support.  In the case of BDS C, I worked with
Leor Zolman to develop the Z-System version of BDS C, with is now included
along with the older CP/M version in the standard BDS C product package.

A more serious error in Lindsay's message was the mirror-imaging of part of
Sage Microsystem's phone number.  I won't repeat the wrong number; the
correct number is 617-965-3552.  The number for the BBS was correct
(965-7259).  The recommendation to call voice late in the evening was also
correct.  The best time to find me at home is between 11 pm and midnight
Eastern time (even that will fail on occasion).  I'm happy to talk about
almost any subject related to CP/M-compatible computing.

   As far as I know, MIX C is still available from Ed Grey, who reads (and
occasionally posts to) this newsgroup.  I'm afraid I do not have his email

   It was nice of someone in a recent posting to recommend my wife's
company, Sage Microsystems East, as a source for Turbo Pascal for CP/M. 
Unfortunately, that product is no longer available.  After Borland declined
to renew Alpha Software's license, Bill Roch (Elliam Associates) and I tried
to convince them to release the software in some form (such as licenses to
other distributors), but they refused.  This is a real shame, because Turbo
Pascal is still an excellent product.  If Borland finds it too much trouble
to count the small sums of money a license could bring in (for no work on
their part at all), the least they could do is release the product to the
public domain.

   I've been promising for some time to release the zmp/rzmp sources, but
it's one of those things I just don't seem to have got around to yet! I'm
currently looking into a Windows version for PCs, so I just rooted out the
sources again. I'll try and post them in the next week or so. Be warned though
that it may not be easy to recompile zmp from the sources: I had to resort to
a few fiddles to get it to compile and run in what is, after all, a rather
restrictive environment for that sort of thing (I had only about 54k of TPA).
I was able to get it to go only by using a particular compiler, which isn't
all that common.

   There were several reasons why I didn't release the sources with zmp in
the first place: mostly, I guess, I didn't want 156 different versions of
zmp floating around (we all learned an awful lot from SD!). In these days
of PCs, Macs and "shareware", I'm more worried about someone else making
money from my code (and, of course, that of Hal Maney, who wrote Hmodem,
from which [r]zmp was derived). Perhaps releasing it all under the GPL will
help: has anyone got any suggestions on this? (Please note that any Windows
port of zmp will be released under much the same conditions as cp/m zmp was:
free to non-commercial users).

   The Zmodem specs, which you should try and get if you intend to write a
program using Zmodem, are probably in Simtel-20's zmodem directory. Try
"yzmodem.arc" and possibly "zmodem810.zip" as well.

> JMODEM would be even better...

   You may have problems with jmodem in a cp/m environment. If memory serves
me right (it's been a long time, and I don't have the docs with me), it's
basically xmodem with an impossibly large (for cp/m) packet size: up to about
14k, I believe. (The Zmodem-like protocol in Fidonet mail systems has a similar
problem, in case you wonder why I never added that capability to Foodo). It
wasn't possible to add jmodem to zmp for this reason: simple lack of memory.
(You may notice that zmp receives files in chunks of up to 16k: if these
chunks are less than 16k, then that's all the memory you have free in your
system with zmp running). It may be possible to get jmodem running by
re-coding the whole lot in assembler, or cutting down on other things, but
the real question is: why bother? Zmodem is probably more efficient under
all but the best conditions.

Subject: Kaypro 10
Message-ID: <3BuauB2w165w@netlink.cts.com>

Here's a bit of a teaser for anyone who wants to play the game.

I have a Kaypro 10 machine with the 10Mb drive installed.  Because of 
(apparently) magnetics in the area, the format for the second partition 
is nearly lost (as is all data).

Question:  Does anyone know of a PD or shareware program to help me 
rebuild the format/partition?  It's little use to have a 400k partition 
on a 10 meg drive, and I can't find a replacement drive for less than a 
can of soda.

Thanks.

Tom

Well, Charles, now that I've dried all the tears from my eyes and can see 
what I'm doing again ...

I own a Kaypro 10 (which I'll be posting about shortly), and I seem to 
remember that there is a program to print graphics with CP/M.  While I 
can't remember ever using it, I do browse the local graveyards here once 
in a while.

You might try writing your own program in, say, S-Basic (came with my 
machine), or in C using some of the DOS C routines for GIFs (again 
noticed while browsing local boards).  The GIF structure is fairly simple 
once you understand how the compression algorhythm works.  You could, 
then, replace the palette with patterns, one for each major color, and 
send the whole lot to the printer.

A program written for the Commodore 64 and the Gemini 10x is still around 
somewhere (I have a copy of the compiled program, not the source).  It's 
called ShadeyDump, and converts any Commodore graphic (bitmapped with 
separate palette of three selectable colors) to a pseudo-dithered 
monochrome file ready for printing.  The program was featured in one of 
the Commodore magazines and should be easily translated to S-Basic or C.

(I hear you snickering over there when I say Commodore, so STOP IT!!)

I hope this helps.  If I see something on a local board I'll mail it to 
you.

Tom

This sounds as the same problem the Macintosh community has with Borland's
Reflex database.

But perhaps some of you know that Borland _bought_ Turbo Pascal from a Danish
company called PolyData. While Borland was selling the compiler under the
name "Turbo Pascal" in the USA and elsewhere, it what still being sold in
Denmark as COMPAS Pascal. Borland furnished it with a better (WordStar-like)
Editor, which eventually appeared in COMPAS Pascal version 3.
(I still prefer the extremely simple editor in COMPAS Pascal v.2.20 ;-)
COMPAS Pascal was also available for CP/M-86 and Concurrent-CP/M.
(It was popular in the late 80's for use with the Regnecentralen Piccoline
computers -- with the 80186 CPU -- used at many schools in Denmark.)

Maybe it is worth investigating whether PolyData still holds the rights on
COMPAS Pascal?

Subject: Uniform Upgrade

When I recently upgraded to MS-DOS 5.0, I discovered out that my versions
of Uniform and Unidos no longer worked. Uniform is a program that allows
a PC to read CP/M disks. Unidos enables the PC to run CP/M software. Both
are produced by MicroSolutions, Inc.

I called the company and was informed that new releases of Uniform and
Unidos do run under MS-DOS 5.0. All that I had to do was send in a very
reasonable $15 upgrade fee, plus $2 shipping and handling, along with the
original software disk.

Within 10 days I received the upgrade disk in the mail. After reinstalling
the software on my system, I am happy to report that it works great!  The
new version of Uniform contains even more CP/M formats than the old one.
Here's the address and telephone number for Microsolutions, Inc.

If you're refering to the Sirius/Victor 9000, it was an 8086 based, non-IBM PC
compatible computer that ran both CP/M 86 and MS-DOS.  If you don't actually
have access to a Sirius, reading the disks can be a problem as they used
variable speed drives (fitting 600k+ onto a  SSDD 5.25 disk).  Best solution,
find someone with both a sirius and another PC and transfer the files by serial
cable. (I have access to such a setup, but I'm a tad far away to be useful :-) )

IUP (Indiana University of Pennsylvania) had a _really_ niffty color

connected to the parallel printer port and had its own Z80 processor
(intelligent peripherals - imagine that! :-)).  It was controlled by

     Turbo-Pascal 3.0x was available for CP/M-86 too.  There were also
     separate MS-DOS and PC-DOS versions.  The MS-DOS version could
     be configured for serial terminals in the same way as the CP/M
     and CP/M-86.

     theories that other MD's (I'm one) have come-up with is the levels of (female 
and male) hormones that circulate in the mother (and hence get to the fetus) 
may affect the baby in this way. How the mother responds to stress in her life 
will determine the hormones that she produces. And everyone has bothe types of 
hormones circulating in their body (estrogrens and testosterone).
>> As for the "precious gift of God..." If it wasn't for Christianity, the 
human race would not have the problems that it does in dealing with 
homosexuality. Every enlighted person knows that Christianity was an opiate 
created to oppress the masses and that is exactly what it has done for nearly 
2,000 years! Just look at all the hypocrisy in the beloved church itself - they
preach against homosexuality, etc - yet priests are regularly accused of child 
molestations, infidelity (breaking the celibate laws), homosexuality with other
priests,etc....

   Lasse Hiller|e Petersen's information about the origin of Turbo Pascal
was very interesting; I had not heard that before.  I remember talk about
origins of Turbo Pascal in France, where Philippe Kahn grew up, I
understand.  This was the first I heard of a Danish connection.  It would be
interesting to see if there would be another avenue to get some rights to
the code.

   I normally speak out against pirating commercial software (and not only
because I am a developer myself), but in situations like this -- where the
person who wants the software is offering payment but the payment is refused
by the producer -- I say nothing against disks being passed around. 
Probably Borland does not even mind that.  These big companies, I am told,
worry about legal entanglements in connection with offering the software for
sale but not supporting it, or even from giving it away.

from the manuals:

  "Welcome to MUSE" contains all information pertinent to version 4.01
  of the MUSE Operating System... It is assumed that you are familiar with

Message-ID: <8NOV199200472108@zeus.tamu.edu>

I just got smallc21 and it seems that I can't use the "%f" conversion
specifier with this compiler?!  Is this not built in this version or am
I supposed to include something? If this is a deficiency, is there another
pd compiler available with a full 'c' implementation? (ansi would be great).

Message-ID: <BxtyKD.EEy@lut.fi>

Yes, I just received againa new piece of interesting hardware, a
Televideo 806/20 and a "computer/terminal" TS800A.
It has a 19Mb hardie.

The problem is connecting the computerm to the "server". Need to make
the cable.

If you have any knowlidge or info on this system, please contact me
by email. You could in your first mail include some descriptions on 
the OS (cpm-80, MmmOST, cpm-86 etc. features, putting it to multiusers
mode ....)

Thanks
