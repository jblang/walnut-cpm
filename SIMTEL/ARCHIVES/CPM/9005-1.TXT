To wilker and ALL of you who were so kind as to forward me the good ideas 
for the DS DD 10 RH floppies, there is still a rich list of suppliers of

Does the Model II support the I/O Byte (i.e.: can you STAT the console out
the comm port)? If so, you can use the generic version of KERMIT with
no customization as long as you don't want to send binaries.

I use the generic version on most of the machines I use; NorthStar, DECmate,
Epson Geneva, Televideo 802, even a DE-100. It works great.

Back in the old days, I took DBASE from an Osborne and worked over with
ZSID to run on an H19.

As I recall, all you have to do is find that escape sequence and patch
its count byte to zero. It will then not print out that escape sequence
after every character.

After quite a while, I discovered that the dBASE from the Osborne was
missing an overlay (I forget which) but I wasn't able to determine if it
was shipped without the overlay or if I merely missed it in the upload
(the Osborne was long gone by then). I think the missing overlay had
something to do with the MODIFY command.

Coincidentally, I recently helped a friend put together a NorthStar to
give to a friend as a word processing system (dual floppy, WordStar). We
ordered a box of floppies from Inmac.

The guy at Inmac told us that the part number had been deleted from the
catalog for over a year, but being a NorthStar user himself knew what the
part number was and that they had some in stock at the time (a couple of
months ago). So it may be difficult to find them from Inmac.

I have the part number posted to my filing cabinet. Unfortunately, I
keep my filing cabinet at the office. I'm at home right now. If I remember,
I'll post their part number.

Subject: Kaypro Replacement Keyswitches/Caps

    I recently inherited an old Kaypro II system which is in good
working order except for having five broken keys on the keyboard. The
former owner apparently lost the keycaps too since he didn't give them
to me along with the machine. I'm trying to locate someone who has an
old Kaypro keyboard who might be able to supply me with 5 switches and
caps to fix the problem. I have found a commercial vendor in CA who
sells replacement keyboards. However, since the price of his keyboards
is more than what I paid for the system, it's kind of hard to justify
going this route. If anyone has one laying around, and would like to
recover some of his/her investment, please contact me. Many thanks..

HELLO! I work for Design Analysis and am very familiar with the DE100
(I helped out on certain bits of the software, most notably the
Turbo Pascal interrupt service routines). I know quite a bit about the
machine.

The machine emulates a floppy drive and a hard drive. It is intended to
be a test instrument for designing MFM data separators for those drives.

I also used one of these things when I was designing a hard disk controller
for an AT. It is a very handy device if your designing a controller.

These are output ports for the machine. You hook them up to the
controller that you want to test.

Remember that the machine is EMULATING A DRIVE. It generates MFM data
at various data rates with programmable bit shift, jitter, etc. This
data comes out of these ports. You can monitor the controller's assertion
of drive selects, etc. on the LEDs.

These are more output ports for the machine. Except that now, the
machine is emulating a hard drive rather than a floppy.

STD bus is a popular industrial control bus.

Incidentally, the machine doesn't ship with MDM; just vanilla CP/M that
autoboots the disk emulator software. It's a shame you didn't get the
manual for the software. It's a nifty package (but them I'm biased...).

These characters are probably part of an unrecognized escape sequence which
the osborne uses to do special stuff like cursor positioning or bold print
or some such thing.  When running on the osborne, is the field being typed
in highlighted or underlined or some special video effect? That's a clue that
this is an escape sequence.  The demonstration probably does all its screen
updating as if the video display is a dumb terminal ie. without cursor
positioning, repainting the whole video screen on update, etc. Generally,
demonstration programs disable the save/write functions which would allow
someone to keep their changes, making it useless for real work.
  To change the program, try to figure out the hex equivalents of the unwanted
characters and place an escape character in front of it.  Then go to your
osborne users manual and see if this matches some escape sequence to do
fancy stuff.  Find out if the TRS-80 has a similar function. Generally a 
program which runs on many different terminal types has this string of
characters defined in a single spot in the install program either as a
length prefixed string or a string with a zero byte at the end.  Use a
debugger (DDT, Z8E) and find this set of characters in the DBINST.COM file
and place a length of zero in the byte before the string if it appears to
be the length of the string or zero out the bytes if that first byte doesnt
seem to be the length of the string. Save this modified version of DBINST.COM
(to another name of course) and try to install Dbase again.  This should 
clear up the problem.
  How do I know this you ask.  Once I had a comm program that used Kaypro 4
video highliting for some messages but on my old Kaypro II it came out as
weird characters like you described because the II (pre-84) did not
support video highliting.

Good luck.  Let me know if this helps.

Contact Kaypro. Two years ago when I had a Kaypro II with a defective keyboard
I called them up and the were selling off their collection of Kaypro II

I would very much appreciate someone sending me the address of Supermicro's

The old Inmac part number was 79080. When I ordered mine a couple of months
back there were some boxes in stock but they didn't show up on the saleman's
catalog because the part number had been deleted. You might want to give it
a try. The price was $14.90 for a box of 10.

I am working to get a diskette of software from someone who has a Kaypro 
running UniForum.  They're too far away for me to look over their shoulder, 
so I've been coordinating this over the phone and through the mail.  

I have a Cromemco System Three running CDOS on two 5.25" DSDD drives.  The
first diskette was written and formatted using some "other" CDOS DSDD format, 
listed as format number 72 in the UniForum menu.  They have located a CDOS 
entry, but I'm not sure that they have the right one.  My questions are:

	1. What is format number 72?  Might it be Cromix?

	2. What is the format number for CDOS DSDD?

I'm hoping that someone on the net has UniForum running, and can take a
quick look at the menu to answer these questions.  Thanks.

This seems like a good time to ask a related question: how does one obtain 
a copy of UniForum?  I noticed that Emerald Microware was offering the PC 
version, in the last issue of MicroCornucopia, but made no mention of the
CP/M version.

Try talking to Emerald Microware [ (503)641-8088 ]. They make a hard disk
adapter that fits under the Z80; you lift your Z80 out, plug it into this
board, and then plug the board where your Z80 goes. It talks to a Western
Digital 1002-05, which they also sell (WD doesn't even admit this thing
ever existed anymore; it seems that if it doesn't plug into a PC they're
not interested). They sell software to drive the thing.
They advertise in Micro Cornucopia if you want to look up an ad.

  Sorry it took so long, but I've found that adding hard disks to a VT180

  It is doable, though, and if you want to keep a cp/m system running,
there is quite a LOT of stuff still availiable out there..

Hello,
 
I just finished reading an informative article in The Computer Journal
Issue 44: Mysteries of PC Floppy Disks Revealed by Richard Rodman.
 
I had always wondered how 1.2M and 1.44 Meg storage was achieved on
5.25 and 3.5 inch hardware.  I am glad to see an article covering this
territory.
 
The article did bring a couple questions to mind:
 
(1) What is the difference between 720K and 1.44M 3.5 inch drives.
 
(2) What is the pinout for 3.5in drives. (a pinout for 5.25in is given)
 
Can anyone shed light on this?

Someone noted that the Infocom company was no longer.  Does this imply

if it is, where may one obtain it.  I have been unable to find it

that it is NOT public domain.  Would someone please elaborate?

No.  When a company stops operating, they still retain the rights to
their assets, and can transfer them.  Activision, or whoever owns them,
holds the rights to the Infocom software.  This leaves new CP/M users
in the frustrating position of wanting Infocom CP/M games but having no
legal means of obtaining them, other than buying them from other CP/M
users or from the dusty stocks of distributors.

On a similar note, it should be mentioned that CP/M dBASE II, whose
port has been discussed here recently, is still copyright by
Ashton-Tate, even though they no longer sell or support it.

Infocom used to distribute their games for CP/M-80.  However, they
stopped distributing these a few years ago; then they were bought by
Activision; then Activision shut them down.  Infocom is no more.

Greetings!

A co-worker has an old Morrow Decision (Design?) CPM-80 machine
that died recently--bad crt or something.  She doesn't want to
spend any money having it repaired (is it even possible?) but
she does want to retrieve the data from her flops.  She has 
been offered a good deal on an XT-clone.

Is there some kind of MS-DOS program available that will let
her read her old cpm floppies on an XT?  (Have I just insulted
everyone in this newsgroup?)  I saw some mention of running
a CPM environment on a DOS machine.  Is that the sort of thing
she should be interested in?

Also, I have an old Sanyo MBC-2000; stats are: CPM 2.2, 
64k, dual 5.25" floppy drives, 2 serial ports, 1 centronics
port.  Software includes Typemaster, CalcStar, BASIC, a 
communication program, Adventure and other odds and ends.
I need to unload this soon, my wife wants it outta her way.
Is this worth more than $1/pound to anyone?

Thanks!

Message-ID: <ee89e4c90e2226450904@canremote.uucp>

To ALL, including you.

I recently acquired a Xerox 820-II with eight inch floppy drives.  I am
in need of advice/information.  I know that these drives spin constantly
and am wondering if there is a way/circuit to stop it, ie. to have them
spin up only when accessing.  I saw something to this effect recently
posted from an old Microcornucopia (sp?) magasine, but wonder if anyone
here has done the same or has a MC magasine from 1975 that they
could look up.  (Please, pretty please...!!  :-)  I don't have or have
access to the magasine back issues.

Also, I would like to start taking software from here at CRS but need to
get it from my IBM with internal modem to the Xerox.  I have a null
modem set up and I can get them to talk text using the Xerox's Terminal
mode.  I also have the 'ASCOM' program, but haven't had any luck.  Is
there a way that I can bootstrap this up to a better system - I presume
that 'KERMIT-80' on CRS is better, so again I need info.... (Pretty
please with sugar (or nutrasweet) on top...)  How do I get a binary over
to my Xerox?

                                        Thanks in Advance for any/all
                                        help.

   This problem is very easy to solve.  You can get the shareware program
22DISK (latest version is in 22DSK130.ZIP, I believe) on BBSs, perhaps at
SIMTEL20, too.  Or you can purchase Uniform from Micro Solutions as
described in another message recently on the net.  I use Uniform.

   You do not need to run a CP/M emulator in order to read the disks; you
need that only if you want to RUN the CP/M programs.  There are many such
emulators and even Z80 cards that go in PCs.  I have such a card from Micro
Solutions in my Compaq 386/16, and it makes a dynamite CP/M system.  One
emulator is the companion to 22DISK called 22NICE.

   Probably not worth even that.  If you are ready to give it away, we at
the Boston Computer Society regularly accept donations of CP/M machines, and
we try to find new owners who will care for them with respect during their
declining years.  If you are ready to make such a donation, please contact

I still have my old Osborne I (80-col. mod, SS/DD) and I was wondering if

stays, er, potent.  Do floppies get senile after a while?  About a year
ago I checked some of the masters, and they seem to be okay.  Of course,
you could say that if I was prudent, I would back them up every couple
years or so.  I bought it < a year before Osborne went away the first time.

And no, I don't actively use it at this time.

[...couldn't e-mail reply...]

The heads remained loaded because on these half-height Tandons there is no
automatic head load/unload mechanism. (I recall that the drive appeared to
be built to accept such a device, but it was not installed - perhaps an 
option?)  The design is such that when the spindles are engaged, the head
loads.  The only way to reduce wear is to turn the motor off when not in 
use.

We went through a lot of agony with these Tandons before we figured out what
was happening...

The 1.44M drive has twice the bit-density of the 720K disks.
I.e. both have 80 tracks/side but the 1.44M drive has twice the number
of bits (and therefore bytes and sectors) per track.

>(2) What is the pinout for 3.5in drives. (a pinout for 5.25in is given)

As far as I know, they are the same (I use both drives on the same
flat-cable, the 5.25" connected with the usual edge-connector, the 3.5"
connected with a berg-type connector.
HOWEVER: there are drives that can use some of the pins for more than
one purpose (e.g. drive ready vs. disk change, something else vs. high
density etc).

Hi there !

If you are connecting to the  5.25 ribbon cable you must have the 3.5 drive
mounting assembly ( like the ones used for PCs ). The actual pin outs from
the drive control board are a little different. I have some docs on a SSSD
 Sony 3.5 and they list the pins differently. If you need the info, let me
Know and I'll be happy to send it along to you.

Hello.

> Can anyone shed light on this?

I hope so. Generally, the 3.5" and 5.25" drives are IDENTICAL, concerning
their electrical and logical details. There is NO WAY to distinguish a 3.5"
drive from a 5.25" drive by software. As far as I know, the pinout is also
identical (however, the 'AT compatible' drives have some special pinout, for
both 3.5" and 5.25"). But, most 3.5" drives use pin connectors instead of
the card-edge 5.25" types.

The different capacities are the result of different data rates. The 720k
formats (both 3.5" and 5.25") are obtained using a data rate of 250 kbit/s
in MFM mode, so one track will contain 9 512-byte sectors per side.
The 1.44M format (only 3.5", as 5.25" drives for that data rate aren't
manufactured) uses a data rate of 500 kbit/s (like 8" drives) with MFM, so
18 such sectors fit onto one track.
The 1.2M format (5.25") is strictly an 8" format: the 5.25" HD drives are
rotating with 360 rpm, so that they behave exactly like an 8" DS DD drive.
Again, there is NO WAY to distinguish by software...

When using different capacities (and/or) different drives, always be sure
to use disks and drives only within their specifications! The HD disks
(5.25" 1.2M and 3.5" 1.44M) use stronger magnetic fields than the normal
MFM disks, so you can't crossover HD disks with MFM formats and vice versa.
However, if you try to format a normal disks for HD, it may be permanently
damaged (with resident magnetism caused by the strong fields).

Besides, always be aware that the capacities 720k and 1.44M (as well as 360k)
do NOT use all legal resources of disk and drive. It's just that IBM (who else)
wasted about 10 / 18 percent of the possible capacity FOR NO REASON!
Formatting MFM disks with 10 x 512 byte or, even better, 5 x 1024 byte, would
give 400k (40 track) or 800k (80 track) net capacity, and all that within
all specifications of the IBM 3740 disk format.
Formatting HD disks with 20 x 512 byte would give 1.6M, with 11 x 1024 byte
1.76M (that is 22% more than IBM!), also legal.

Again, one example how performance is WASTED by a company of which still
some people think they were able to design computers...

In a recent posting to unix source code group, there was an interpreter
for certain infocom adventure games. My impression is they run on a 
virtual machine, so that a disk for machine X would include the X
version of the interpreter, plus the global code for the game written
in virtual machine code. Thus if you could find infocom games for say
C64 or coco or atari, you would have a chance of using these on a 
CP/M machine.

True. InfoCom is owned by Activision, which in turn is owned by
MediaGenic.

I suspect that to find whatever InfoCom products are still stocked,
one would need to contact MediaGenic:

It would be interesting to know whether they still have any InfoCom

I have recently acquired a old Morrow that runs CP/M 2.2.  It seems
to work fine except that the keyboard is really flakey.  Some of the
keys work occassionally; some not at all.  In order to keep the normal
"typewriter" keys going, someone used the key mechanisms from some of
the function keys.  In short, I need a new (or newer) keyboard for this
beast.  The terminal is a Morrow MT-70, made in Taiwan.  It appears

Well, I can't comment on the higher density drives, but I've heard that IBM did
have a good reason for using 360K DSDD 5.25" diskettes rather than 400K.
Apparently the Intel disk controller that IBM used in their original machine is
not reliable writing and reading 10 sectors per track.  So the started out with
8, and then moved up to 9.  My Kaypro 4, using the Western Digital controller,
reads/writes 10 sectors/track (400 K/disk) with no problems.  There's even
someone out there doing 11 sectors/track (440 K/disk) successfully.
  I guess it was a little dumb of IBM to go with the Intel rather than the WD
controller, but then again, what did you expect after they chose the 8088....

   Here is some information that someone passed on to me that might be of
interest to people on the net.

          ------------------------------------------------------

While browsing through a local software liquidation establishment (a common
enterprise in this part of the world - Silicon Valley), I stumbled across
something which should be of interest to anyone interested in 8080/Z80
assembly language programming.  The below-listed store has at least 30 copies
of the Microsoft M80 assembler for CPM80, with manuals, for the great price
of 10 dollars each.  I am not sure which version of M80 it is, as the plastic
box was sealed, but it likely includes the L80 linker and (whatever the REL
librarian is named).  These appear to be unopened originals and are available
only in eight inch single density format.  Looks like a super deal, and is
totally legitimate from all appearances.

This would be especially useful for a assembler beginner wanting to use REL
programming aids such as SYSLIB, Z3LIB, etc.  Or, if you have a pirated copy
of M80 already, just the manuals that come with these would be worth it.

For more information, contact:

Herb's Discount Software
4406A Enterprise Place
Fremont, CA  94538

I have no connection with this establishment and am simply passing along what
I saw there today.

Message-ID: <2456@gmdzi.UUCP>

How to write a signed compare of two 16 bit integers in Z80 assembler? The
obvious solution doesn't work:

	LD	HL,a
	LD	DE,b
	AND	A	; reset carry flag
	SBC	HL,DE
	JP	P,IS_GREATER_OR_EQUAL
IS_LESS:...

For example, let a=8000h, and b=1. The program should not JP in this case.

The only compact and correct solution I could find was the following one:

	LD	HL,a
	LD	DE,b
	AND	A
	SBC	HL,DE
	JP	PO,LABEL
	JP	P,IS_LESS
	JP	IS_GREATER_OR_EQUAL
LABEL:	JP	P,IS_GREATER_OR_EQUAL
IS_LESS:...

But this one looks very ugly to me. Does someone know of a shorter and/or
faster solution?

Let's see. The easiest solution I could think of was something like this:

	LD	HL,a
	LD	DE,b

	;Remove 8000H bias from signed numbers

	LD	BC,8000H
	ADD	HL,BC
	EX	DE,HL
	ADD	HL,BC
	EX	DE,HL

	;Now we can do an unsigned compare

	AND	A			;Clear carry
	SBC	HL,DE
	
DONE:	;Carry flag set if a<b
	;Zero flag set if a=b
		
This removes the 8000H bias on signed numbers to make them comparable as
unsigned numbers. However, it is not the shortest/fastest one, and
clobbers BC.

A little thought reveals the removing the bias is not needed if both
numbers have the same sign. And luckily, if they don't, we do already
know the answer (or can find out easily). This leads to

	LD	HL,a
	LD	DE,b

	;Test signs

	LD	A,H
	XOR	D
	JP	M,DIFSGN

	;Equal signs, do an unsigned compare (carry already clear)

	SBC	HL,DE

	JR	DONE

DIFSGN:	;Different signs, set up the carry (zero already clear)

	LD	A,H
	RLCA			;Does not modify zero flag

DONE:	;Carry flag set if a<b
	;Zero flag set if a=b
		
But this still does not satisfy me. However, we can employ a trick to
get the carry and zero flags right in case of different signs. If HL has
the negative signed number, it has the greater unsigned number, and the
unsigned subtraction will thus result in a carry set the wrong way.
The same thing happens when DE has the negative signed number. Thus,
in the case of different signs, we just have to reverse the operands to
the compare to get everything right. Or:

	LD	HL,a
	LD	DE,b

	;Test signs

	LD	A,H
	XOR	D
	JP	P,EQUSGN

	;Different signs, have to reverse the operands

	EX	DE,HL

EQUSGN:	;We can not do an unsigned compare (carry already clear)

	SBC	HL,DE

DONE:	;Carry flag set if a<b
	;Zero flag set if a=b
		
This is the best I could think of; it uses only 5 instructions for the
actual compare (8 bytes). If anyone knows better, please mail (or post).

A lot has happened since then, and I now have *two* C compilers.

The first is BDS C, which was produced by Leor Zolman and is now supported
by Jay Sage.  I've been told that it's the fastest CP/M-based C compiler
around.  I believe it.  Certain sacrifices were made, such as the exclusion
of floats and statics, but for cause.  The resulting code is small and fast.
$90.  I *like* it.

The other compiler is Aztec.  For those who may remember, I'd reported that
Manx had dropped their CP/M version, and I was subsequently corrected.  The
*correct* phone number is 1-800-221-0440.  Their sales manager, Debbie
Hertler, informed me that there is no on-going development, but they are 
still distributing the latest version, 1.06D.  They are now selling at half 
price, so it's only $99.50 for the Developers package, which has everything 
but the library source, which is in the $175 Commercial package.  The compiler
claims to comply with K&R on everything but bit fields, which I don't use.  
The price is paid in speed and space.  Compile time is measured in minutes,
compared to BDS C's seconds.  Resulting COM files are about twice as big, 
and run about 20% slower.  Ain't no free lunch.

If you plan to buy a C compiler, and are pressed for cash, go with BDS.
It's faster and more efficient.  It is a living product, too, with a real
live contact right on the net :-).  It does include a floating point library
that works on character arrays of binary-coded decimal, and appropriate
coding to allow printf to handle them.  Not as nice, but it's there.

If you have the bucks, get both.  When you want really fast code, you can 
use BDS.  When you get tired of beating your head against a wall over missing
features, you can switch to Aztec.  They both have their place.

Oh, yes.  Thanks to all those who responded to my original inquiry.  If
anyone has questions about either of these compilers or about the other 
suppliers I'd considered, please send email (gonzalez@bbn.com).  I know
there are at least one or two other BDS and Aztec users reading this
newsgroup/mailing list, and would be interested in trading war stories.

More food for thought: we recently got a tape backup for one of the AT's
at work, and there was a little adapter widget that plugged onto the
34 pin header on the back of the tape drive. Interesting note: the widget
had both a 34 pin header to attach to the ribbon cable, and the big Molex
4 pin power connector: these spoke to the outside world. However there
was _ONLY_ the 34 pin connector going from the widget to the tape drive.
Add to that, the fact that the two power lines from the Molex (1 and 4)
were wired to pins on the 34 pin connector going to the drive, and I'd
say the connections on this beasite _WERE_ different. According to the
docs it's supposed to replace your B drive, but I don't know how you'd
make a tape drive look like a disk drive to the 765 disk controller chip.

Message-ID: <1846@iddth.UUCP>

   I have made an MS-DOS Emulator for CP/M+, which allows the CP/M+ to
recognize the MS-DOS diskettes. The files on these diskettes can be
read, written, deleted and changed by using CP/M's commands and programs.
The emulator runs only on Commodore 128, but I would like to install it
on other machines also (and to make a version running under CP/M 2.2).

Subject: Need BDOS Call Tables
Message-ID: <56128@bbn.BBN.COM>

I am in the process of hacking a copy of SD122 to work under CDOS.  SD122
is version 1.22 of Super Directory, a public-domain disk directory program.
CDOS was Cromemco's standard operating system.  CDOS is very much like CP/M, 
right down to the memory map and BDOS table.  Well, almost.  The BDOS table 
matches for calls 0x00 through 0x1B and then skips up to 0x80-0x9F.  It is 
missing things like a call to retrieve user number (0x20), and has a different 
call number and format for getting things like the OS version number (0x8D vs. 
0x0c).  I think this is largely because CDOS was CP/M 1.3 compliant, putting
its own calls well above the customary CP/M entries.  It has hooks for neat
things like multi-user operation.

The best CP/M reference I have is _Soul_Of_CP/M_, by Waite and Lafore.  They
left out descriptions for half the system calls, implying that things like
set/get user code are not of interest.  Very disappointing.

According to the table of CP/M calls provided, the calls go up to 0x24.  On
the other hand, the Microsystems pocket guide indicate that the calls go up
to 0x28.  SD, unless I'm misreading the disassembly, uses calls 0x2D and
0x2E, as well.

So, could someone post a copy of the latest BDOS call numbers for CP/M and,
perhaps, CDOS?  I know that the documentation with this system is out of
sync, ahead of the hardware and behind the software.  Thanks.

CEO summary:
I have been looking into the BDOS replacements available on Simtel20. 
However--I do have some confusion concerning what system would be the 
best to go with.  For a CCP replacement--the system of choice is 
ZCPR3.  So a system that works well with ZCPR3 is essential.  I would 
also like a system that does time stamping of the files--this knocks 
out a couple.  Some of the contenders seem to be Z80DOS and NovaDOS.  
There seems to be more for Z80DOS.  What are most people using?  Is 
there anyone that is using a replacement and ZCPR3 for the QX-10?  
Thanks.

I have a Cromemco CDOS system that is old, slow, and single density.  Since
recently acquiring a fast, dual density CPM system with lots more memory,
I would like to trash the old system.  Unfortunately I have a significant
amount of software that requires the additional BDOS calls available under
CDOS.

I remember seeing advertised in old S100 Microsystems issues, an emulator
package that could interpret the CDOS calls on a CPM system.  Anybody know
how I could get my hands on this product?  Or have another solution to the
problem?

Actually, the problem is in the drive rather than the controller. With
10 sectors per track the drive has to be within 1/2 percent of the spec
rotational speed in order to reliably format a disk. DEC's RX50s (which
use 10 sectors per track) are only speced to 1 percent speed, so you cannot
always format diskettes in an RX50. This is why the Rainbow originally
shipped without a diskette formatter; having a format program did not
guarantee that you could actually format a diskette.

Is anyone  using (successfully) the OKI MSM5832 clock/calendar chip?

The one in my 8 year old Alspa Computer CP/M box died late last year,
but I didn't get around to replacing it until several weeks ago. The
new chip (#2) was bad (several things didn't work) so I ordered a
replacement (#3) which seems generally to work, but both #2 and #3
exhibited one common problem:

   If the year is set in the 90s, the 10s digit in the month gets
   set also (I tried to set month=5, but got back month=15!). 

I can live with this problem by setting the years to 00 (for 1990) and 
modifying my C/P2DOS/UUCP time functions, but I am curious to know if
others are having this trouble.

I wish you the absolue best of luck because there is NO such thing
because the Apple II series is not designed to run MP/M (or CP/M
for that matter.  I know becuse I have an Apple ][ Plus with a
Microsoft SoftCard and an S-100 bus computer with the necessary
hard- and software to run MP/M.  It takes more than software to
get MP/M set up; it takes some more hardware.  In my case, my
processor switches between tasks; it's just one Z80 running 3 users.
The Apple, I seriously doubt, could handle that type of load.  It
would have to be a concurrent system (several processors running
separate of each other; Applicards, with a little work, would
probably work, but no more than, say 3 or 4 users.  Microsoft and
any other systems that take full control of the Apple bus are out
of the question.  A footnote to the Applicard method, you have to
have character I/O on each board because if you went through the
Apple keyboard, it would kinda defeat the function of MP/M if
you're wanting multiple users with single tasks; single user with
multiple tasks, now that is different.  Yet another footnote on the
SoftCArd and equivalents, that is COMPLETELY out of the question
because those cards require that the Apple have lots of memory,
whereas the Applicards have their own memory and can operate
independantly of the Apple, except for I/O.  Plus, the SoftCard is
phase-locked with the Apple's clock and it would be too slow
because the Z80 can only run at 2MHz, and the Applicards have their
own clock and can run up to 6 MHz or 8MHz with a Z80H and a couple
of modifications.

I seem to have rambled on a bit.  Have fun, and like I said before,
good luck!!!  You're gonna need it!!!  (grinsmilegrin)

Since 1983, SIMTEL20 provided access to network mailboxes for various
users without their own network host.  We offer this service to Army,
other DoD services and agencies, and federal agencies, and their
contractors.  Until recently, it was possible to provide access to our
actively maintained software collections via FTP and on tape because
we already had that paying customer base to support.

For the past year or so, our paying customer base has dwindled.  The
anticipated separate funding for the Ada Software Repository did not
materialize.  The local backup funds has finally been exhausted due to
severe cutbacks.  Thus, we had to cancel the excellent contractor task
support provided by Rick Conn and Keith Petersen for the maintenance
of our Ada, MSDOS, MISC, CP/M collections and the tape copy service.

This cutback will not affect the independently maintained Unix/C and
Macintosh collections.  Access to our collections via conventional
ANONYMOUS FTP and LISTSERV/TRICKLE will also continue.

We always follow up leads on potential new customers.  Unfortunately,
none show much promise lately, due to similar severe funding cutbacks
in the respective organizations.  We have also been searching for
sources of institutional funding without success.

We understand that many of you consider SIMTEL20 to be a valuable
national and international resource.  We planned to greatly expand the
available disk space and improve access to this system through a
proposed connection to NSFNET through WESTNET.  We now need your help
in finding unconnected paying mailbox customers and potential
sponsors.

Specifically, we need to provide evidence to our management and
potential sponsors that this service has a real return on investment
and is a valuable resource to the government.  Because this is an Army
facility, we need documented proof from those in the Army first.  In
particular, we need to know how access to our collections has saved a
tangible amount of money or time to do your job.  Be specific, please.
Other DoD services and federal agencies are encouraged to contribute
their proof as well.

If you are a researcher or support researchers on government funded
tasks, can you document savings in cost or time because of your access
here?  If you work for a government contractor, check with your
management to see if they would be willing to support similar
documentation.

Please send your statement on your official letterhead and signed by
someone in top management, if possible.

I'm currently using ZCPR33 (you really ought to go with that one
because most of the Z-system utilities are Z33 or better specific).
My BDOS replacement of choice is NovaDOS because if I ever run into
a program that requires ZRDOS compatibility, I'll be ready.
However, if you need timestamping, Z80DOS is your better choice.
Plus, if you decide to go NovaDOS, there are a few slight glitches
in it that Lindsay Haisley (the author) and I have gone through.
You might want to send me email to me at the address below and I'll
tell you what's going on.  Like I said, if you don't look forward
to time-stamping, but would like ZRDOS compatibility, NovaDOS is
for you; however if you're planning on doing time-stamping, Z80DOS
is for you.

The last isuue detailed out the reasons for the demise of Micro C. 
It was not for lack of subscriptions (it was as popluar as ever). The
creator and editor finally burned out over his entire life dedicated to
puiblishing the mag. Several groups expressed interrest in continuing it,
but financing and concerns over continuing quality of the mag caused
the editor to not appove any deals. I am particulary sad over loosing such a
good, creative tech journal. What other magazine had a technician on duty for
answering questions?

Ross, 
uC was folded quite deliberately because Dave Thompson simply burned out.
Read his editorial in the last issue.  Dave's been running the mag
with pretty low overhead and a lot of personal attention for 9 years
and he needed a break (I can sympathize).  Due to his very personal
touch, you just can't hire another editor and expect the rag to look
anywhere near the same.  
     I'm sorry to see it go, but looking back, the hints were there
when Dave quit hosting the SOGs at Bend.

Well,
    The one I now own (bought it from a co-worker) has a board in it
    that stops the disks from spinning after about 30 seconds of idle time.

    It is a "Disk Control Unit" from

	Optronics Technology
	PO Box 81
	Pittsford N.Y. 14534
	(716) 377 0369

    The kit assembly manual/leaflet is copyright 1983 and says:

	"5. Compatible with all popular 8" drives, standard CP/M and
	other operating systems."

	"7. Auxillary input provided for use on the Ferguson Big Board
	or other systems which provide disk on-off signal."

    Circuit contains a 555 timer, opto-isolator, triac, etc.

    The manual gives the sequence of operations for soldering the parts
    into the board and splicing into the 820's wiring.

    You could try contacting them or you might find one in some other
    piece of equipment.

Harvey, 

  I once had a Design One hard disk on my Ozzie that was connected via the 488 port.  The outfit was in Silver Spring, Maryland - just north of Wsahington, DC.  Three years ago they were still in business supporting their old hardware.  If you could find someone with the pinouts and the boot disk, you should be able to make it.  The HD was a standard full height st-506 type drive (20 mg.)  Way back when it cost $3500.00.  Those were the days...

Subject: Alternative PD Sources?
Message-ID: <56407@bbn.BBN.COM>

Now that the CP/M archives at SIMTEL20 are going away, I'm searching for
alternative sources of PD software.  

I've had mixed results with the Boston Computer Society ZI/TEL library, 
since all of its disks are customized for Kaypro and the sources are 
frequently left out.

Leor Zolman, in his BDS C manual, explicitly points users to the C Users'
Group as a good source of inexpensive software.  Annual membership is $28,
including a subscription to the C Users Journal.  This entitles you to
access to over 300 volumes (diskettes) of PD software, including Small C.
They include diskettes of software specifically coded for BDS C.  They also
sell a two-volume directory, for $18, describing the contents of each volume
and the compilers known to handle them.  For anyone interested, an packet of
information canbe obtainedby contacting:

		The C Users' Group
		2601 Iowa Street
		Lawrence, KS 66047
		913-841-1631

Has anyone gotten software from these folk?  How about the index?  Is it
really worth the money?

Jim,

Perhaps you misread what I wrote.  The collections will remain here as
well as access to them.  What we were forced to drop is contracted
maintenance of the Ada, MSDOS, and CP/M collections, i.e., keeping
them current.  In fact the maintainer of the Ada collection has
volunteered to continue maintaining that collection on his own.  The
CP/M collection has been fairly static for quite some time.  It is the
high volume of turnover in the MSDOS collection that will be a problem
to keep current.  We already have a part-time volunteer to help, but
without Keith Petersen, it will not be the same.

To paraphrase Mark Train, the reports of the death of SIMTEL20 are
greatly exaggerated.

What?  I never even heard about this.  When are they going, and where are they
going to?  It would be a shame for them to disappear completely.  I know a
couple of people in this area who might be interested in hanging on to them,
for at least local access.  Is there any chance that I could get ahold of them
on magtape or something like that?  All replies via email, please.

Well, he's quite near reality. But, after looking at the spec's of the 765
I found that 10x 512 Byte ARE POSSIBLE with rotational speed errors of 2 %,
fully within specs and with great enough gaps. BTW, 11 sectors are NOT
allowed.

But, as I mentioned in my last message, WHO DID EVER FORBID SECTOR SIZES
OTHER THAN 512 BYTE ???? Using 1k Sectors you get greater capacities, less
gap loss and a speed factor of TWO within sequential access. Why, I really
ask WHY DOES NOONE KNOW ABOUT THAT? Have a look at the Osborne's!

Last (not least), I have to mention that the 765 FDC is better than the WD
controllers. It does handle four drives without software overhead, and the
interfaces to both CPU and FDC are very simple. The software expense for
getting things working is smaller, as you don't have to fool around with
the bits on disk (when formatting, for example)...
BTW, did you ever hear of the 37 C 65 (from WD and SMC) ? It's fully compatible
to 765, but includes two clock osc, FDD decoder, 48 mA drivers and PLL.
It is just connected to FDD and CPU bus and works! Packaged in DIP 40
and PLCC 44 cases. I'm using it in my last project (a Z280 single europe card
computer) with great effort. Fine chip, better than every WD x79x !

Nobody forbids that, and many 8" DD formats used 1K sectors. The problem
is memory space for buffers. Most CP/M machines were squeezing hard to
get things to fit and leave room for some applications programs, too.
Doubling all the disc buffers would have been prohibitively expensive
in terms of a scarce resource.

BTW, the original floppy formats used 256 byte sectors, as I recall...

So does the 1793. At least the 1793 in my Televideo 803 seems to talk quite
happily to all four drives attached.

Here I have to disagree. I've worked with both the 1793, and the 765, and the
software overhead for the 765 is way higher than that for the 1793.

Fooling with the bits _DOES_ have it's advantages :-)

I've been reading the discussion about just how much you can actually fit
on a DS DD disk with various controllers with quite a grin. With a 1793
is _IS_ possible to get the equivalent of 11 * 512 byte sectors on one
track, in tests I've had it working. You put 5 * 1K (10 * 512), plus a
single 512 byte sector in the space left over. One of the nice things
about the 1793 is that you can get right inside it's mind: a read track
operation just sits there and reads _EVERYTHING_ - gaps, address headers,
data, CRC bytes, the works. [1] So you put 5 * 1k on there, do a read track,
and find about 680 to 700 bytes left over: plenty of space for a 512 byte
sector to snuggle into.

[1] this also makes it infinitely superior for doing error recovery - a
read track _CAN'T_ bitch about bad CRC's since it ignores them.

> Fine chip, better than every WD x79x !

I'll agree with that when I see it put 440K on a DS DD floppy.

Well, at that point you should have a look at CP/M Plus (or other modern,
banked systems). We are talking about which format to choose NOW, not about
the reasons our grandfathers got choosing small sectors.
The 64180 system I use now leaves a TPA of 61.25 K (BDOS entry at F500), and
the new Z280 system I'm programming now has 62 K (BDOS at F800). I certainly
will reprogram the resident BDOS part to fit into 2 pages (instead of 6), so
my TPA will be 63 K (BDOS at FC00).
BTW, there are 256 K of system memory used for hashing and buffering, but this
has absolutely no influence on TPA size. That's what banks are for...
In fact, I don't see ANY REASON for using smaller sectors!

> BTW, the original floppy formats used 256 byte sectors, as I recall...

Sorry. The original floppy format was 8" SD with 26 128-byte sectors. That is
the reason why a 'logical record' is still 128 byte (not only with CP/M).

Message-ID: <30113@cup.portal.com>

Please pardon the wide distribution, but I dont know the dist for
NJ only. If you must flame me, be so kinda as to tell me what it is!

Anyways:

I have a CP/M machine, that I need to get rid of. Why? I dont use it,
and its taking up some room I need. Its fairly large, stands about
4' tall, 2' wide and deep, and is on wheels.

Its a genuinly unique system: a prototype build cira 1979, but didnt
make it too production. I have -all- the manuals, tech notes, engineer
blue-printer, etc etc etc, for it. Its a complete working system
(probably built for commercial or environmental applications, due to
its packaging)

Some specs:

Two Shugart SA801 8" SSSD drives, 8080 CPU (2MHz I think), 48k RAM (but
dont hold me too that, it may have a full 64k). It has a front panel
to put to shame the IMSAI: a 16 digit keypad, a full address and data
7-segment display, various buttons and toggles. It has two monitors:
one is a full screen, 14" or so monitor. The other is a 5" screen,
which varies depending upon function (real-time debugging or diagnostic
codes).

Along with all the disks, and manuals, I have a full set of buss-cards
that go with it. BTW: this is not an S-100 buss.



As I said, free to the first taker, with one catch: You pick it
up at my house in NJ. I -cannot- ship this unit, due to its sheer
size.

More details if you call voice, or mail back

  Well the title pretty much says it all; I have a Softcard but no
software!  If this is still live, sold software, does anybody have a
copy to sell?  And if not, would somebody be willing to make a copy
for me?
  And, on another note, I have a couple of Osbornes without video
connectors to enable the internal monitors (seems I'm a bit short

the upper traces on the connector to the lower ones but want to

Subject: SuperCalc2 for a Kaypro.
Message-ID: <9005230638.aa02067@CRDEC2.APGEA.ARMY.MIL>

Is there a reader of this network that has a copy of SuperCalc2 for a Kaypro
that runs under CP/M 2.2 that is not using the software and is interested in
getting rid of it?  I have three copies of this software at our laboratory 
here in Edgewood Arsenal that is pre-configured for a Superbrain, and just 
tried to get the translation from Sorcim(Computer Associates) to enable it
to run on a Kaypro1.  Ironically, one copy has never had the original disk
envelope seal broken.  It was like talking to a brick wall at CA.  I don't 
think they even know what SuperCalc2 is.  (If its number is less than 5, it 
never existed.)

I am in the process of trying to find the clear screen pointer in the code. 

It does seem to operate properly on the Kaypro, but willnot clear the screen.
Any help would be appreciated.

On the back of my Xerox 820 is a DB25 connector which I assume is a serial

figuring out what the device name to address this port is.  A "stat dev:"
only lists the devices:

			LST:

I have tried using these device names in the PIP command but nothing seems
to work the way I expect.  I also tried "PIP AUX:=B:filename" but only got
an invalid device message back.

Can someone please suggest to me how to address this port.  Also, if I
need to setup baud rate, parity, etc. on this port, how do I do that?

Any help would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks.

Steve,
      I think the problem is that your requesting the directory. The one
you need is PD2:<CPM.ZCPR33> or PD2:<CPM.ZCPR3>. The first one contains
all the latest ZCPR3 related files.. the second only contains a READ.ME.
You might wat to ask for PD2.<CPM.FILEDOCS>SIMCPM.ARK which contains the
latest listing of the entire library with file descriptions in an
ARC/ARK format. It's usually updated once a month. If you don't have
access to a un-ARKer program, request PD2:<CPM.FILEDOCS>SIMCPM.IDX and
PD2:<CPM.FILEDOCS>SIMCVT.BAS which is the index file and a basic
conversion to convert it into human readable form. I hope this info
will be of some help to you. Have a good day...

From: SAGE@LL.LL.MIT.EDU

   Jim Gonzales asked about sources for CP/M software.  I had also
misunderstood Frank Wancho's message about the status of SIMTEL20 and
was glad to see the clarification.  I know lots of places to get the
latest software but very few places to get archival material.

   There are hundred of remote access systems in North America that
can be contacted by modem.  Every month a listing is published in a
file called RCPMyymm.LST.  [This and other files listed here may
appear in compressed forms of various sorts, so don't look for the
exact file type that I give.]  Of course, you have to know of a RAS to
start with to get this list, but then you will have access to a great
number of systems.

   Two special telephone data services can help keep phone bills under
control: PC-Pursuit and StarLink.  Both of these services provide off-
hours access to commercial data communications channels.  With PC-
Pursuit, for example, you pay a flat rate of $30 per month, for which
you are allowed 30 hours of access at speeds up to 2400 bps to about
40 cities served by PCP.  StarLink costs less per month but charges
for each hour of access, but much less than standard voice phone
rates.  It offers access to far more cities than does PCP.

   Two other important sources of public-domain CP/M software are
GEnie and CompuServe.  Both maintain extensive archives, and both work
quite hard to maintain current listings.

   For sources of commercial CP/M software, people should consult
either of two listings that are posted from time to time on remote
access systems.  They have names like CPMSRC-#.LST (CP/M Sources) and
CPMSVL-#.LBR (CP/M Software Vendor List).  The number symbol here
stands for a version letter.  The people who compile these lists try
hard to verify periodically that the vendors are still in business and
still offering the products listed.

   SIG/M (Special Interest Group / Microcomputers) used to compile
public-domain software into disk volumes for regular release.  People
without modems could purchase these diskettes.  However, SIG/M ceased
activities a couple of years ago.  Recently, Chris McEwen, Bill
Tishey, and I have teamed up to offer a similar service for Z-System
software.  The service is called Z-SUS (Z-System Software Update
Service).  It offers several special collections of files (for
example, one comprises more than 300 programs in executable form,
i.e., COM files) and a regular subscription service that brings you
the latest releases that appear on Z-Nodes.  Five or six volumes have
now been released.  You may contact me for further information.  If
you leave a mailing address, I will send you some material about Z-
SUS.

I agree that modem access is pretty good nation wide, but in a
rural area like Indiana, the access to local CPM BBS's is not
great. Hence for those of use with FTP access, SIMTEL20 is an
unique resource. As far as I know, other sites do not mirror
the SIMTEL20 CP/M directories.

Well, c't went the way most mag's do today: Everything that is Messydos is
HEAVEN and everything else (especially CP/M) is HELL. Last few issues, they
even bashed CP/M in *every* editorial. Hard- and software articles about
Z80/180/280 and CP/M weren't published for a long time, and (I guess) will
never be again.
But there are some CP/M groups here in germany being still active with hard-
and software. For example, I just designed a Z280 single board (europe card)
computer capable of running CP/M+ without externals (Power, floppy and
terminal, of course). Fits onto ECB bus (64-pin VG connector), and contains
64/128K EPROM, 512K/1/2/4M DRAM, FDC, RTC, NVRAM, 2x RS-232. Clock speed
12.288 MHz, as soon as 12.5 MHz CPU is available. Meanwhile 9.8304 MHz.
CPU runs with 16-Bit Z-BUS, the DRAM circuit supports 'Burst Mode'.
The prototype board works very well, I'm now implementing my (180-proven)
autoformat-BIOS for CP/M+ and re-layouting the PCB.
Cost of the 'naked' PCB is supposed to be under $50.

I have started trying to do something useful with the CP/M third of my C128.
There appears to be almost enough of a CP/M system to be useful.  One thing
I am missing is LOAD. HELP refers to it as HEXCOM.  But, neither are on the
system or utility disk.

My questions are:
1) For $20 comodore offers a CP/M manual and two utility disks.  Does this
   contain the basic utilties I need to get up and running?

2) Is there a better source for basic utilities?  (I found several utilities
   on a mail server, but I need to move at least UUDECODE across as a hex
   file.)

Of course it does. The hardware developers had to do by extra hardware what
the chip didn't support. As a result, it is impossible to step four drives
simultanously, while always watching all four 'READY' lines (just an example).

Unless you try to achieve the overall comfort and performance of the 765,
I agree... (Just think of the 'READY changed' interrupt.)

> Fooling with the bits _DOES_ have it's advantages:

And it's disadvantages. All the troubles with different disk formats are
caused by people who wanted to create 'their own format', incompatible to
everything else (or to get slight features, thereby nevertheless becoming
incompatible). And now you try to argue for a format with different sector
sizes on one track. I strongly recommend that NOONE should ever use such a
format. This method, together with irregular sector (or track!) numbering
should be forbidden anyway. Not for the 765, but for some basic rules.

High disk capacities, OK. But only the legal way, s'il vous plait.

> I'll agree with that when I see it put 440K on a DS DD floppy.

Independent of the previous: please show me a member of the x79x family
with the whole floppy interface (as mentioned earlier) on a SINGLE CHIP !
Just fits in the gap between CPU and FDD. No glue logic, no clocks, no PLL,
even no drivers!

I got a copy of SC2 from a computer surplus store.  $10 for the 
software and manual, new.  My copy was pre-configured for a morrow
computer, but it seems to me that there was some sort of configuration
utility included that allowed one to configure the software for any
given terminal.  I think that most of the Morrow computers were
sold with a Liberty terminal, but the owner really could attach any
terminal they felt like.  The configuration program patched the
executable.  Perhaps that is all that you need.  I'll look this weekend
to see if I can find my copy to verify what I've just said.

There are two of them.  The British one is the official organ of the
British Computer Society, which makes it our equivalent of the CACM.

Unfortunately, Peter, the 820 is based on the WD 1771 controller which is
SD *only*.  There are (were?) upgrade kits available for this beast to
make it DS/DD (390K on 5.25" diskettes).  When applied to the 820, it
thinks it's a Kaypro.  I did one, and jumped the clock to 5 MHz.  The
result is a really nice machine!  The vendor had connections to MicroC,
and was located in Aloha, Oregon.  I can get more info, if you're in-
terested.
It also may be possible to put two DS drives on the vanilla 820, and
use sides as logical drives, i.e. A: is drive 1 side 1, B: is drive 1
side2, C: is drive 2 side1, etc.  This works best with 8" drives, but
I think that you'll have only about 250K per side because each side
is formatted as standard SS/SD (26 128b sectors/track, 77 tracks).

I got my $20 package from CBM quite a few years ago.  Included was a single
manual that consisted of three or four Digital Research CP/M 3.0 manuals.
Nothing in the manuals was C128 specific.  On the disks were all the utilities
mentioned in the Digital Research documentation, including the HEXCOM that you
mention as well as MAC, RMAC, LIB, LINK, XREF, SID, the source code to the 
BIOS, standard (Z80) and specific (8502) macro libraries for the assemblers.
When DR went from 2.X -> 3.0 some of the utilities were replaced with "new
and improved versions", Including LOAD(HEXCOM) and DDT(SID).  The disks totaled
3 - C128, 1541 compatible single sided disks (one of the disks was a flippy).
Bottom line, I felt I got my moneys worth.  Your mileage may vary.

Hi all.  I am new to CP/M, so be kind.  My father was given a Televideo
TS-803 and he is looking for any of the database software that will run
on it.  I have (cough) volunteered to help him set this up if ever we
find the software.  Can someone tell me what I need to get (will any CP/M
stuff work, or must it have been made for the specific machine?) and how
I can get it?  If anybody out there has what I would need, I would love
to hear from you.

Thanks a lot!

If the only problem is clearing the screen on the Kaypro, your solution is
easy.  Fire up your favorite binary file editor (Edfile, for example), load
SC2.COM, and change location 01f5H from 0CH to 1AH.  The clear screen commands
for the two units differ.

What is 'Symtel20' and how do I reach it.  I'm new to this newsgroup
(and newsgroups in general) so I'm afraid I will need a rather
complete explaination.

thanks,

> I have a Xerox 820 with 2 SS/DD drives.

By the looks of it, Peter has an 820-II, not an 820.  I have some comments
on Rogers message though.

While it's true that the Xerox 820 can ONLY handle single density, it can
indeed handle double sided drives, 5 1/4 or 8 inch.  And yes, you can use
"cheepy IBM-PC 360K" drives on them ... you will just end up with DS/SD
drives.

As to the 820-II, I had a pair of "cheepy IBM-PC 360K" drives on mine.  Let
me point out that you will want to use CONFIGUR, to change the step rate to
6 mS.

There is one thing to watch out for however, when converting a Xerox 829-II
(and 820 no doubt).  That is the drive cable.  Many of the single sided
disk cables are missing the wires carrying the signals needed for the
double sided drives.  I no longer remember which ones, but if I remember
right, four wires are missing (two are grounds).
