i run mex114 on a tandy model 2 and i use this system to communicate
with several xenix systems.  what i would like to do is to get mex to
local print on command from the remote.  i have several other emulators
that will do this, but mex is more convenient.

I can do the esc P (ctl-J P) at the keyboard and can print with no
difficulty.  I want the host to be able to initiate the local print.

my question is basically, has anyone done this, or am i overlooking
something obvious, or is this just totally out of the question?

thanks in advance...

immediate improvement in the formatting of the "from" line headers to
make it easier to reply to messages posted from the Usenet side.

I wish to take this opportunity to thank Dave Towson for all his

   I woudn't suggest a Tandy Model 4 for programming usage. It has the wierdest
memory banking system I've ever seen, the source code for the BIOS is quite
difficult to get, and the hard disk subsystem is unusually expensive. It also
comes with 2 single-sided 5-1/4" floppies, where I recommend at least DSDD
floppies for programming work (.PRN files and macro libraries can get quite
large). There's only one serial port available for it, and no real applications
notes. I would rather suggest ther Kaypro model 4 (floppy) or 10 (hard) systems.   For my use I use a S-100 machine. Disadvantages: Pre-made software is not
easy to find, and it's BIG. Advantages: most of them came with source for the
opsys, and in my case I'm running both 8"DSDD floppies (*reliable* storage at
1196K) and a 5-1/4 floppy, with a 240K ramdisk made by hooking in a bunch of
random manufacturer's memory cards. I can change processors, controllers, and
add I/O simply by plugging in (a la STD), as well as change opsyses from
IMDOS (one of the first) to UNIX, etc. The advantage of S-100 over STD is
that hardly anything save Z-80/8080/8085 was ever made for the STD, whereas
S-100 cards I have seen myself include 8080/8085/8086/8088/80286/80386, 
Z-80, HD64180, 65xx/68xx/68xxx/32xxx, etc. You also get a feel for the system,
because improving your system often means implementing code yourself, thus 
giving you a 'feel' for your environment. It's been around for quite a while,
and looks to keep on into the future, with new cards coming out monthly for
all kinds of wierd industrial and commercial applications.

Thank you for your comments regarding the use of the Applicard and Super
Serial Card at 9600 baud.  In answer to your questions, I am attempting to
use MEX+ to communicate between the Apple/Applicard and a VAX11/780.  MEX
uses the regular CP/M BIOS to communicate with the Apple, though this can
be bypassed, I believe, by suitable patches in the MEX patch area.  What
you have said is encouraging, though it suggests that a special DRIVER
will have to be acquired or written for the Super Serial Card.  Any 
information that you can provide on this would be useful.
                                   thank you again

Subject: Tandy Model 4 Misinformation


Kevin J. Belles made some rather mis-informed comments about the
Tandy model 4 recently.  While it is true that for some time the
standard configuration of a Model 4 was SS drives, the CURRENT
machines from Tandy have DS drives; also, many if not most of the
used machines have been upgraded by their previous owner to
DS drives.

The 'BIOS' code is easily available in commented assembly listings
from Misosys, Inc.

The banks switching is 'weird', you say??  It is simply controlled
by 4 bits in $OPREG (the Option Register), which is directly linked
to CPU port 84H.  It's more complex to explain than it is to use.

Further, as I said in my previous post, there is NO Z-80 assembler
I have seen that can compare to Pro-MRAS by Misosys.  If you want a
comprehensive list of its many features, I'll post one.

As regards the Kaypro; the Monezeuma Micro version of CP/M is much
superior to anything I've seen on the Kaypro.  Using the extended RAM
available in the 4, MM CP/M automatically provides a 64k RAMdisk; the
memory can also be used by programs like Monte's Window, which is
similar to SideKick, and VERY useful (the TRSDOS 6.3 equivalent is
called Pro-WAM).  Further, there is a utility available which will make
the memory drive the SYSTEM drive, and so on.

The Model 4 is not JUST a CP/M machine, it is much MORE.  I don't
deny that it has its quirks -- no machine lacks them.  However, I
DO assert that it is distinctly superior to machines like the
Kaypro, which are virtually being ignored by Kaypro.  The 4 is no
longer Tandy's showpiece, but it is still supported.

Well, here goes my first posting to this group, and I hope it makes sense
I know the MODEL I might be dead but for me it has served quite a useful
purpose,  to enlighten me in hardware and software difficulties

first of al let me describe my current system:C{


	MODEL I running CP/M 2.2 (ZCPR3)
        20 M harddrive
	2 serial ports (1 running terminal)
	a real time clock.

	The CPM me and a friend have developed from scratch , he did the
hardware and I did the software.  And I thi7{k we are ready to release
it to public domain.  The hardware documents and the BIOS source
code.  The system works quite fast and is relatively cheap to 
convert to CPM ....   I just don't know if the demand for CPM is there
anymore.   So mail me and let me know if anyone is interested in this posting
if not,  I will go back into obsecurity.

Quite correct.  In fact, that was my immediate responce to Kevin when I saw
his first posting. (If you'll note we are both on the same Unix box..)  I
am currently using my Tandy 4p with MM CP/M with the extra 64K of memory.
I have not yet saved sufficently to upgrade my drives to DSDD, but it
should be noted that the MM Config file allows the current hardware to run
SSSD SSDD DSDD DSQD and 8" formats.  I have also been told that 3.5" drives
are available that are electrically identical to 5.25" drives..

There are also expansion kits to add 1 Meg of memory to the 4/4p/4D.
There are also speedup kits to 6 and 8 Mhz, and a daughter board that runs
that new Hitachi chip and 256K of memory directly addressed. (There have
been postings here on it...)

maintainer of the SIMTEL20 archives.

     Due to a misunderstanding, info-cpm has been running on both AMSAA-SEER
and SIMTEL20 since March first.  This became obvious after I posted a note
announcing the addition (to the list Keith thought HE was running) of our
first reader in Japan; and Keith sent me a polite note saying in essence, "Hey
Mack, what's going on?".  Yes folks, even electronic communications can't do
away with human error - sigh.  Anyway, we finally got it straightened out, and
I have now adjusted the mail pointers on AMSAA-SEER so that any info-cpm mail
that arrives here will be sent along to SIMTEL20.  I see from (belatedly)
reading the last several days' mail that most of you are already using the new
address:
                           INFO-CPM@SIMTEL20.ARPA

I guess everyone got the word except me.  Sorry for the confusion.

     So welcome to our new list maintainer.  The job is now all yours, Keith.


Best regards,
Dave

And several other reasons not to use a Model IV.

I run a Model IV with 2 DSDD 5.25" drives, 390k each, as well as 2 DSDD 8"
1.25 meg each (with a Holmes disk controller), for a total of >3 meg online.
For those who have the hankering for such things, Montezuma Micro provides a
sample BIOS with its documentation (not the actual BIOS, but a stripped-down
version).  I could also install a 256k ramdisk (but with 1228k disks and
access time under 15 ms for a resulting throughput time that would beat the
pants off almost any 8088 machine around, who needs it?), and I
can run at least 4 different operating systems (TRSDOS, which has an
excellent base of Tandy supportware, LDOS, Multidos and CP/M).  True, the
memory banking is somewhat unusual (and, to be fair, has caused some
incompatibility problems with some software--most notably ZCPR3), but is far
from the "weirdest".  In short, the Model IV can be a very good programming
environment.  And it *does* have an impressive amount of support.

Subject: Modifications to Applicard System

I am looking for some help from someone who is very familiar with
the Applicard system.  A copy of the CCP, BDOS and BIOS is kept
in the Apple host and is loaded to the Applicard during a cold
boot.  On warm boot a fresh version of the CCP and BDOS is
loaded.  What I would like to do is to make additional space in
the BIOS region, to put some additional code which I have
developed for using the CTC chip as a real time clock.  I
currently have this code patched to the BIOS, but hanging outside
of it.  It is not kept in the Apple but has to be loaded by means
of an initialization program.  It would be far neater if some of
this code could be permanently placed in the BIOS area.  To do
this I need to lower the starting point of CP/M in the Apple from
the present position of 9100H.  This starting point is
established by the coldboot routine and is easy to adjust.
However, I suspect that simply changing this starting point may
cause problems to the some of the other code which resides in the
Apple.  I am familiar with the CCP, BDOS and BIOS bit maps but I
think that there may be other things to consider.  I would like
to discuss these matters with anyone who is familiar with the
Applicard to this level of detail.  I have added to the end of
this note the PCPI6502.MAP file (from SIMTEL20 PD:<CPM.APPLE>) to
illustrate what is happening in the Apple.
                              Thank you in advance,

Failing that, does anyone have a BSD4.2 compatible file unsqueezer?

Doug, you must have an old copy of the catalog.  The SIMTEL20 Unix
directories are being reorganized and some files have been moved.
You'll want to get a new copy a.s.a.p. (actually anytime you think
something is there but it doesn't seem to be).

The squeeze/unsqueeze files have been moved to the PD:<UNIX.SQ-USQ>
directory.

Subject: Help on caching algorythm?

     I'm rebuilding my BIOS to (among other things) change my 
hard disk track buffers over to caching.  I've gotten almost the 
whole thing written, but I have one algorythm I need some help 
on.  I have 4 (will be 8) buffers in another bank of memory, 
which each holds an 8 K logical track.  Each access to a buffer 
increments a counter, so I know how often (since last warm boot) 
a buffer has been used.  I've done the easy part, finding a 
buffer (if I have a cache 'hit') or allocating an unused buffer, 
now I'm looking for an algorythm to deallocate a buffer when I 
don't have a 'hit' and there aren't any free.  I have a few 
ideas, but there are problems with each:
     LRU: Least Recently Used.  I think the algorythm goes 
something like "when you use a buffer, move it's number to the 
top of a block of memory, shuffle others down to make room, and 
if you need a buffer, use the one whose number is at the bottom 
of the list."  The problems are maintaining the data structure 
without reams of code, and the fact that a buffer with a high use 
count can be deallocated by merely reading 4 (8) different tracks 
before you get back to the first one.  Thus you could lose your 
directory track fairly rapidly, and I know I'm going to need that 
frequently.
     Smallest count.  Look for the buffer that got used the 
least, and use that.  Looks good as an idea, but there is a major 
coding problem.  Given a table of 4 (8) numbers, how do you find 
the smallest? [I'm coding in Z-80 assembly, so MIN(x,y,z) doesn't 
help :+)  ].  If you start scanning from the beginning, you will 
tend to deallocate number 0 more than number 3.  If you don't 
start at the beginning, the coding gets messy.  If there are 2 
numbers that are a minimum, which one do you pick?  I though of a 
way that would work, "start with one, look for it in the table, 
if not found, look for two, if not found, look for 3, etc, etc, 
etc".  I'm using byte counters, so I'd only have to go up to 255, 
but this is kind of a hack, any better ideas?
     Are there any other, more popular, more useful, simpler, or 
more elegancache algorythms that anyone knows about?

Subject: More info on Draco
Message-Id: <488@myrias.UUCP>
Sender: info-cpm-request@simtel20.arpa
To: info-cpm@simtel20.arpa

Many thanks to John S. Fisher for his comments on Draco. I'll reply to each
of his points in turn.

(1) bad code for read(ptr*) where ptr is 'ulong' - I haven't tried this,
    but it sounds reasonable, and shouldn't be hard to fix. I'll do it
    before long.

(2) lack of goto making a decision table hard to implement - I'm afraid I'm
    a pretty strong fan of structured programming, so Draco is very unlikely
    to acquire a goto construct. I'm not sure exactly what you mean by
    decision tabled based, but can't they be done like state machines, which
    usually go something like this:

	type State_t = enum {st_start, st_end, st_nice, st_blue, ...};
	State_t CurrentState;
	
	CurrentState := st_start;
	while CurrentState ~= st_end do
	    case CurrentState
	    incase st_start:
		if blah blah blah then
		    CurrentState := st_nice;
		else
		    blih blih blih
		    CurrentState := st_blue;
		fi;
	    incase st_nice:
		do something or other
		CurrentState := st_end;
	    etc.
	    esac;
	od;

(3) Wants fixed-format input capability - fixed format input can be read using
    non-fixed format input, so long as there are delimiters of some kind. If
    not, reading character arrays, adding a space to the end, and doing
    memory-to-memory I/O works.

(4) lack of floating point - Yep, its a problem for those who need it. The
    format the compiler uses is IBM-360/370 float format - sign bit, excess
    64 hexadecimal exponent, and 24 bits of hex normalized fraction. The
    linkage needed is exactly that described for operator types.

(5) Hmm, I guess I could have checked for sufficient TPA. The needs depend
    on the complexity of your program, however (recursive descent parsing).

(6) how expensive is 'open' on character strings (memory to memory I/O)? - its
    about 10 lines of Draco code in the run-time library, and the per-
    character cost is considerably less than disk or console I/O.

(7) extending CRT library to handle input, special characters, etc. - sounds
    like a good idea, but it would take a fair amount of thought and work.
    Any volunteers?

(8) Support and source - I'm quite willing to fix any bugs found, but not to
    extend the compiler or libraries (there's no memory space to extend the
    compiler anyway). I'm not sure how to distribute updates, however. If some
    individual wants to become a distribution site, I'm willing to send that
    person the sources, and any fixes that are needed. I DON'T want the
    sources widely distributed, however. The compiler is very tight code,
    and most attempts to change anything will just result in a broken
    compiler. If someone wants to become the distributer, send me a note
    with your net connections, and a bit about your experience with 10,000
    line programs.

and Jack Goldstein had some questions

- yes, Draco has conformant array parameters (any number of dimensions)

- no proper modules (it's high on my list of wants), but some sort-of ones

- constant declarations allow arbitrary compile-time expressions, including
  if - expressions (same for array bounds, etc.)

- type, constant, external procedure and variable declarations can be freely
  mixed, but must come before all procedures

- 'otherwise' clause on 'case' - yep, it's called 'default'

- register keyword as in C. Not on the 8080 version, since the way I did
  things required all the registers in some cases. I plan on them for the
  68000 version, however (all my 370 compilers had them).

- assert statements - nope, but you uglily do the same thing with
  conditional compilation and 'exit'. Draco DOES have a compile-time
  assert - as in 'if XSIZE < 10 then error("XSIZE not big enough") fi'.

- other ports - a friend has a Radio Shack 6000 Xenix box, and we've talked
  about porting the 68K version there. Also to Mac and Atari. Nothing will
  happen unless I have access to the machine, however. Meanwhile there is
  the Amiga version (coming Real Soon Now).

    Re:   Any Bondwell 2 owners out there?

         I'd like to correspond with other Bondwell 2 owners to exchange
    hints & kinks on programming this laptop.  My major interest now is in
    programming the LCD display to do graphics, something which seems to
    have been left out of the BIOS code.

Bondwell does have a Graphics BIOS available for this great CP/M laptop.
Unfortunately they have decided to discontinue this model as they feel
that it is not as profitable (or in competition with) their MS-DOS version,
even though they could NOT supply the demand for the CP/M version.

If you can find one on close out special you may want to check it out.
some of it's features include; full 25 x 80 LCD (200 x 640 pix) display,
Z80 w/ CP/M and full MicroPro line, built in 3.5" disk (2nd 2.3" or 5.25"
external disk optional), 512K RAM disk optional with CP/M in ROM, 1 serial
1 Cintronics ports, runs about 6 hrs/charge or on AC with adapter/charger
unit...  I've had mine (two) for about a year with no problems, and would
be very unhappy without one.

First I'd like to thank John S. Fisher for the beautiful UNARC/UNLIB/UNSQUEEZE
utility to run under VM/CMS. It works great! Now we can print the huge document
files!
Can anyone help me with the following problem?
On the SIMTEL20 archives I found the file PD:<CPM.C128>C128-CPM.JUL.
In it there was a description of various Commodore 128 files.
But I can't find some of them, probably because they're in a different
directory. Does anyone know how to get by them ?
I'll include a small part of the file.

Well, while we are on the subject, there is yet another Z-80 machine around.
Namely, the MAX-80 by Lobo. I'm not a big fan, but if you have to have a
Z-80 machine, this one is worth checking out. It runs CP/M or LDOS.
Outputs are, 5-inch floppy, 8-inch floppy, SASI harddisk, Centronics
parallel, 2 RS232 ports (Zilog PIO chip),  and composite video. The
RS232 ports can be set up to generate interupts, so it can run serial
I/O at 19K baud. It has a real keyboard, with ALL the keys and a good
feel, for those touch typist. I have a 3.25 inch floppy drive on one of them
that holds 750K and the drive only cost $175. The MAX is fairly cheap to
expand since the controllers are smart. It doesn't have high-res graphics.
It does have programable fonts. For more information, you can contact
Lobo Systems, 7334 Hollister Ave., Suite J, Coleta, CA 93117.
Phone 805-968-6929. I have a couple of their machines and they run fine.
Warranty service has been quick and when they fix a machine, it stays fixed.
Usual disclaimers go here.

Unfortunately, as has beset most companies making CP/M computers, Lobo has
gone out of business.  I own two of the machines and they have been rock
solid.  It came with the most complete CP/M Plus implementation of any
machine (so says an impartial third party who has seen them all), and was
one of the best TRSDOS style machines as well.

If you like CP/M and find one of these machines for sale, snap it up.

Well, I for one would be very interested in getting your CP/M and I suspect
there are quite a few model I users out there who feel the same way.
(On Compuserve and GEnie, I have run into a LOT of people who still hack
with the model I.)  

Although I only use the model I for playing some fun Infocom games, it would
be fun to be able to hack around with a public domain OS.  Will you post the
sources?  Sure would be nice.

Another thing, how much work would be involved in getting the CP/M up on
a model IV?  I assume not all that much.  What does your hardware modification
consist of?  Remapping the lower 16K of memory?

So in conclusion, go ahead and post the CP/M.  Thanks.

Message-ID:  <8703111343.aa09986@AMSAA-SEER.AMSAA-SEER.ARPA>

Does anyone know anything more about the apparently newly announced
"CMOS Little Board/PC" from Ampro?  Since I heard only good things
about their Z80 Little Board, this new one may be a reasonable
upgrade from my venerable H89.  What I really what to know is

   1.  Is this thing fully IBM-PC compatible, whatever that means?
   2.  Does its V40 cpu mean I can continue to use my beloved CP/M80
       software?  (Isn't the V40 the schizophrenic chip with both
       8088 and 8080 personalities?)
   3.  How much for the board and its options?

The one and only ad I've seen for the unit claims the following:

o  Mounts on a 5.25" drive (like all Little Boards).
o  5 volt only and at 3 watts(!).
o  Keyboard, speaker, parallel and 2 RS232c ports.
o  PC bus (unpowered?).
o  SCSI for hard disks and FDC for all densities of 5.25, 3.5" floppies.
o  768K ram.
o  Boots PC-DOS (but so does the 80186-based Little Board and it only
   runs the MS-DOS generic applications).
o  Optional 4-mode video controller, mono, Hercules, CGA and "high-res
   CGA" (= EGA?).
o  Clock with battery backup

Additional information:

	It runs most Model I/III/IV programs.  (Not all because the
	serial ports are different devices, but many)  It also runs
	a nice version of CP/M 2.2 and the nicest version of CP/M +
	(also known as CP/M 3.0) that you've ever seen. The source is
	included, and is heavily commented.  
	It has 128k ram and a battery-backed up real-time clock.
	Runs LDOS 5.1.x for R.S. programs.

Rumor department:
	Lobo Systems was known to be in financial trouble, and I don't
	know their present situation.  As far as I do know, this is
	their one and only product, which seems to guarantee a short
	life these days.

Sales department:
	I have one of these babies for sale.  Includes 2 360k floppies,
	2 8" Shugart DSDD drives, lots ofsoftware, manuals, etc.
	First $700 takes it all.  You pay shipping. 

(parting with it because of the usual reasons....my work requires that
I have an IBM compatible machine at home)

Subject: Info about CP/M files on SIMTEL20

This document is intended to give a brief overview of files stored
in the public domain archives at SIMTEL20.

     Many of the files in our archives have been compressed and/or
grouped together in a single file by using one of the utilities
available to the public domain that either SQueezes, CRUNCHes,
LiBRaries, or ARChives files.  This has been done to minimize disk
storage requirements and also to minimize download time.

     These processed files are specially named with a filetype and can
be identified by the last 3 letters of a filename after the "." that
signifies the conversion.  These are:

        .ARK   for CP/M files archived (same as MS-DOS "ARC").
        .LBR   for files libraried.
        .?Q?   for squeezed files (middle letter is a Q).
        .?Z?   for crunched files (middle letter is a Z).

     A library is a group of files collected together into one file in
such a way that the individual files may be recovered intact.  A
library file can be identified by the "LBR" as the extent of the file
name.  LU (Library Utility) is a CP/M utility used to maintain
libraries of files.  LU does not perform any compression.  Because of
this, most people will squeeze or crunch files before adding them to a
library if they want to save space.  If you want to remove the
component files (members) from a LBR file, you should have a copy of
LU.COM or other LBR extractor utility.  At the end of this document is
a list of the programs available for that function with libraries.

     Recently, popular CP/M Public Domain software files and
information files are being distributed using ARCHIVE files.  Archive
files are similar to library (LBR) files in that they take a logical
group of files and put them together in a single file.  The main
difference, is that the members of the "ARC" or "ARK" file are
automatically compressed.  The compression algorithm chosen is one of
three which will produce the smallest file.

     Archive files have been available to the MS-DOS and PC-DOS areas,
but, have been made useful in the CP/M environment with the
introduction of the "UNARC" program.  The current version is 1.4, and
is available with extensive documentation, and two executable COM
files, a 8080/8085 version and a Z80 version.  The Z80 version takes
advantage of the expanded Z80 (and equivalent) instruction set for
speed and size, and therefore is machine dependent.  There is also a
modification overlay to adapt the program to non-standard CP/M 2.2 and
3.0 operating systems, such as CP/M68k and CP/M emulators.  Programs
are available on many machines to process "ARC" files, the Atari ST,
systems running the UNIX systems, systems running MS-DOS, and CP/M.

     There currently is no CP/M utility available to make an "ARK"
file.  Archive files will be made in the MS-DOS/PC-DOS, TOPS20 or UNIX
environment.  To avoid confusion on RCP/Ms that support both MS-DOS
and CP/M callers, Archive files have a file extension of "ARK" for
CP/M software and information files.

     Some files on SIMTEL20 have been compressed, using one of the
standard public domain utilities, to minimize download time and to
save storage space.

     Files that have been compressed can be identified by the filetype
(the last 3 letters of a filename after the '.') that signifies the
compression.  These are:

        .?Q?   for Squeezed files (middle letter is a Q).
        .?Z?   for Crunched files (middle letter is a Z).

     USQ120.COM is used to unsqueeze, or expand files that have a "Q"
as the middle letter of the filetype.  Such files have been squeezed,
or compressed with SQ111.COM or similar.  These programs use Huffman
Encoding to reduce the size of the target file.  Depending on the
distribution of data in a file it can be reduced in size by 30% to 60%
by squeezing it.  If you download a file with a filetype indicating
that it is squeezed, you will need USQ120.COM to expand it before you
can use it.  There are other programs available, written in different
languages and take advantage of special hardware, but USQ120 is
8080/8085/Z80 compatible.

     Other utilities are available that have the unsqueeze coding
imbedded and function with squeezed or unsqueezed files.  There are
programs that perform file maintenance functions (NSWP), bi-directiona
display utilities (BISHOW), and string search programs, (FYNDE and
FINDU).  This method of compressing files has been used for some time
now and programs to uncompress the files are available to several
micro processors and main frame computers.

     CRUNCH uses the Lempel-Ziv-Welch (LZW) techniques.  This method
is fast and offers compression ratios around 55%.  Highest compression
is achieved with graphics data, values of 90% are typical, followed by
text, with 50%, and COM files around 20%.  This method is new to the
CP/M environment.  See CRUNCH23.LBR for the Z80 CRUNCH and UNCRunch
programs.  See FCRNCH11.LBR for the 8080/8085 and V20 CRUNCH and
UNCRunch programs.

     Since this method of compression is relatively new, the only
utilities available that processes crunched files are "typer"
utilities such as TYPELZW, TYPEQZ, and LT, which also type members of
libraries and squeezed files.  If running a 8080/8085 processor, check
the documentation to determine if the utility will only process files
on systems using the Z80 processor.  Currently, there is no compatible
program for other micro processors or mainframes.

     MicroSoft BASIC programs are always saved as ASCII files (saved
with the ",A" operand).  They may than be squeezed or crunched.  This
has been done to allow them to be converted for use with other BASIC
compilers or interpreters.

     Some executable files have a file extension of "OBJ".  These are
really "COM" files that have been renamed to "OBJ" to avoid execution
on RCP/M systems.  Rename them back to "COM" for use them as commands
on your system.

Regarding CPM disk caching:

I, too, have recently added disk caching to my BIOS code to improve effective
hard disk performance, with good results.

However, I cache on a disk record (128 byte) basis, reducing the granularity
problem.  Since the BDOS requests records in any case, this puts the cache
logically between the BDOS and any blocking/deblocking/track-reading code that
you might have in the physical disk driver.

I have 180 kbytes of bank switched memory which is divided between the hash
table (2048 words), the cached records themselves (128 bytes/record), and the
table identifying the cached records (4 bytes/entry).  Each cached record is
identified by its drive designator, track, and sector (as seen by the BDOS).
The cache is currently operating with "write through", so the disk is never
out of sync.  Preliminary profiling with a typical mix (for me) of editing,
assembling, and file manipulation operations suggests that record writes are
only 5%-10% of the total accesses.  Reading a large file from the cache
(assuming no cache misses but including all the operating system overhead for
directory lookup) runs under 2 milliseconds per record.  The hashed record
lookup is crucial to achieve this speed.

To reallocate cache space I use a simple "not recently used" algorithm,
somewhat similar to what are called "clock" algorithms.  Each record in the
cache is assigned a flag bit, set whenever the record is accessed.  Upon a
cache miss, a reallocation pointer circulates through the cache entries,
looking for an entry with the flag not set, and unsetting the flag of each
entry it passes.  Note that it is guaranteed to eventually find an unset flag.
Records that are used often, will set their bit again, before they are dropped
from the cache on the next circulation of the pointer.

The code is (naturally?) written in Z-80 assembly, and is fairly clean, but
has machine dependencies due to the memory bank switching.  Please let me know
if you desire further information, or can make suggestions.

Take a look at Maurice J. Bach's book "The Design of the UNIX
Operating System."  Look specifically at the section describing
the chapter describing the algorithms and data structures used
to implement the buffer cache.  (I think it's in chapter 3.)
The key idea is that the linked list structures automatically
implement an LRU strategy which is a lot easier and faster than
maintaining and checking reference history.

     While roving through a flea market recently, I ran across a MITS
88-Diagnostic Card, Revision O.  Really kind of an interesting board..

     While I realize MITS is long gone, might someone out there have

me think there's maybe a functional voltmeter on the card (readable by

    Will there be any more releases of KERMIT for CP/M?? I have the 
CP4KER version and have modified it for running on our old Altos 8000/7
under MP/M 1.12 . It works quite nice, but characters are disappearing if
the load is too heavy. I haven't tried to make it interrupt-driven.

   What I miss now is the possibility of emulating VT100 because we have
changed computer from a DEC10 to a VAX8750. Now I need tremendously a
VT100 emulator, not the VT52 which is used now.

   Any hope in near future for me and some others using still a
Altos 8000/7 with MP/M 1.12 ?????

Subject: Crunched files

Ralph Hyre asks about the significance of .?z? files.
These files are crunched files, which use a data compression algorithm which 
generally produces smaller compressed files than the "squeezed" .?Q? files.    
The means to "crunch" and "uncrunch" may be found in PD:<CPM.SQUSQ>
CRUNCH23.LBR.1 on SIMTEL20.   Crunched files should not be confused with 
.AZM files which are used as source files by several Z80 assemblers, e.g.
Z80MR.  Non-crunched .?Z? files crunch into .ZZZ files.

Re:   <CPM.DSKUTL>FSDU.LBR  (full screen DU)

FSDU is HARD WIRED in ALL the info it should get from the DBP (e.g.
BLOCK ZERO starts on TRACK 2, and MAX TRACKS = 76, skewing, dbl/sng
density, byte/word blocks, etc...) which needless to say causes gross
problems on a hard disk system!  When I tried to log in my B: and C:
disks it gave me the next 76 tracks of the A: drive!  Also there is no
patch area (or even equates) for terminal codes, these too are hard
wired all over the code.

This program could cause much misery to someone less than expert at
CP/M disk conventions.

What wonderful news!  Especially since I have a Z80 CP/M machine which can
handle 5.25" disks.  I recently acquired the correct controller card and
software which allows my machine to read Kaypro II (and other) disks.

Now for the bad news:  after gathering my pennies and soliciting requests from
friends with similar machines, I called Infocom's 800 number.  I was planning
to order about $300 worth of Kaypro II stuff and was surprised to hear that
they are completely out of stock.  For ALL CP/M stuff.

On the off chance that the 800 number operators didn't know about the "funeral
sale", I called the technical assistance number.  They told me that if the
operators didn't have them on their computer, they weren't available.

Still, I haven't given up.  I managed to get an order form from a friend (who
has LOTS of Infocom stuff for his MSDOS machine, **SIGH**), and mailed off an
order today.  When I get some sort of response (either games or a note telling
me that they aren't available) I will post the news.

'Til then, keep on hoping!

   Have a kaypro ii that has been getting flakey. Would appreciate the

Now I'm concerned.  I called Infocom about 4 weeks back to check on
availability for Kaypro stuff and was told they still had stock on
everything.  I mailed off a check the next day, but have heard or seen
nothing from them yet.

But now for some (I hope) good news.  If I'm correct in my assumptions, you
should be able to run much of the MS-DOS stuff under CP/M.  Here's how:

The .COM file for an Infocom game is a generic file; the only thing that
changes from Zork I to Hitchhiker to Suspended is the .DAT file.  Any .COM
file will run any .DAT file simply by changing the name of the .DAT file to
correspond to the .COM file.  Thus, for example, simply by changing the name
of HITCHHIK.DAT to ZORK1.DAT, placing it on a disk with ZORK1.COM, and
typing ZORK1, you should be playing Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.  Neat,
huh?  I have verified that this does work with the CP/M versions (I have 11 
of the 17 Infocom games for CP/M and I've run them all with ZORK1.COM using
this method). 

Alternatively, you could open up, say, ZORK1.COM with DDT and find where it
says ZORK1.DAT, then change that to HITCHHIK.DAT and it should then run as
is with HITCHHIK.DAT.

Thus, I assume that the same is true for MS-DOS versions and, what's even
better, you should be able to transfer a .DAT file from an MS-DOS version
and run it with any CP/M .COM file.  As I haven't got access to any MS-DOS
Infocom games I haven't been able to verify this, but I can't see any reason
why it shouldn't work.  Could you do me a favor?  Give this a try for me and
see if I'm right.  I'm anxious to know.

Haah,

I can't comment on Infocom's stock since I've never ordered directly
from them, but I'd like to pick a few nits with Calvin Culver's
response to Tim Brengle.

Yeah, when I was starting out with the Zork trilogy on my CP/M machine
I discovered that all ZORK?.COM files were the same, and by patching
one with DDT you could change the data file reference from ZORK1.DAT
to ZORK2.DAT.  This is very easy to do because the name is near the
beginning (don't delete the blanks between ZORK1 and DAT).

When my wife bought an IBM clone I bought some Infocom games for it.
Since the games run faster on her hard disk system than my floppy
system, I considered porting the .DAT files.  As a test I patched
HITCHHIK.COM to use LEATHER.DAT and it worked.

Ok, so I've confirmed Calvin's claims.  The gotcha is that in the newest
games the .COM files are customized -- they aren't as generic as they
used to be.  For example, HitchHiker warns you to put on your peril
sensitive sunglasses before showing your score.  One game even added a
new command (not the "oops" command; several games have that).  While
you may be able to run one games data with another .COM files, some
things (perhaps critical ones) may not work.

I agree that CP/M .DAT files should work under MS-DOS.  If I ever stop
playing Hollywood Hijinks long enough to wire a new cable I'll try to
transfer some .DAT files and see what happens.

The 12th annual Trenton Computer Festival will occur on April 11 and 12,
1987, on the campus of Trenton State College, Trenton, NJ.  (Actually,
Trenton State is located in Ewing Township, a lovely residential suburb
of Trenton, and not in the city itself.)

Last year, we had over 17,000 people who attended the 11th anniversary of
the original personal computer show.  TCF is the largest non-commercial
show of this kind in the country.  It is run by volunteers from Trenton
State College, Mercer County College, Amateur Computer Group of NJ, 
Philadelphia Area Computer Society, Central Jersey Computer Club, Princeton
section of the IEEE Computer Society/ACM, NY Amateur Computer Club, and
Philadelphia Heath users Group.

There are over 100 speakers scheduled to speak on a great variety of
topics.  Additionally, there will be special conferences on packet radio,
public domain software, education, business applications, and computers
for the handicappped.  TCF sponsors an essay contest for junior and senior
high schoolers.  First prize is a computer system!

The computer graphics theater features movies and videos showing applications
of the latest and most interesting applications of graphics.

The games contest lets kids get their hands on and win prizes.  The 
telecommunications area lets grown ups sample commercial information
services at no charge.  And there are door prizes awarded by drawings
throught both days.

Saturday evening features the TCF banquet with a nationally known speaker.

Since about January I have not been able to get any replies back from
the Archive Server at Simtel-20. I remember seeing a note about a month
or so back saying that return addresses for Bitnet sites were not being
coerced into the correct form by the mailer at the WISCVM gateway between
Bitnet and Arpanet. Does anyone know if this is still the case?
Are other Bitnet users able to access the Archive Server - and if so, how?

Any information about the situation would be gratefully received.

  I would like to hear from anyone who might have access to the source
code for the set of programs used with the Teletek hard disk
controller (HDC).
  After accepting my purchase order Teletek discovered that several of
that product's components were missing. If I can find them somewhere,
I am sure I will be able to arrange with Teletek to get a copy.
  About a year ago I enhanced my Teletek Systemaster-I CP/M system by
adding a hard disk and the Teletek HDC. The purchase included COM
files for HDLOAD (loads driver into BIOS), HDPATCH (patches parameter
table in HDLOAD), and HDU (utility to park heads, verify disk, etc.).
These were identified as being version B.10.
  In December I ordered the source code for these programs. The first
diskette they sent me had a garbled directory. The second contained
(1) version B.40101 of HDLOAD.ASM [an updated version, good enough],
(2) version B.0 of HDPATCH.ASM [which predates my original programs
and is incompatible with them], and (3) HDU.ASM [but with none of its
subroutines]. Finally, Teletek admitted they can't find the source
files for the missing modules.
  Incidentally, I got started on all this when I tried to install
SUPRBDOS (the public domain replacement for DRI's BDOS) and discovered
that the HDC driver trashes the IX register SUPRBDOS is using. I can
easily modify the new HDLOAD to save and restore the IX register. And
I might be able to install the parameter table manually. However, the
new HDLOAD and the original HDU appear to be incompatible.
  I would appreciate whatever help anyone can give me.

  I would like to receive recommendations about librarian programs
(both public domain and otherwise) which work with Microsoft format
relocatable library files.
  I use SLR Systems' suite of excellent programs. Their assembler and
linker understand both Microsoft and SLR formats. Unfortunately, their
librarian program (SLRIB) knows about SLR format only. This makes it
impossible for me to manipulate Microsoft format libraries.
  The background to this is that I just updated my Ecosoft ECO-C
compiler from version 3.30 to 3.48. Their libraries are released in
Microsoft format only, and I have found bugs in both versions.
Fortunately, I purchased their source code so that in the cases I've
encountered so far I am able to link correct modules directly. But it
would be nice to be able to patch the libraries themselves.

Greetings netlanders,
 
I'm interested in running a hard disk (ie. Tandon TM-501) on my Altos 5-15ad
system. I would think I'd just need the appropriate host/controller board
and cables to turn it into a Model 5-5.
 
I've called Altos, and was steered to a fellow selling these boards
for a sinful $2400 per set. This is not appealing to me, as that represents
exactly twelve times what I paid for the computer.
 
Anything helpful would be appreciated. Thanks.

I purchased a Northstar Horizon at a ham radio flea market this weekend. The
box contains a 20-meg hard drive and a 5.25" half-height Shugart disk drive.
I'm not sure, but I think the system is running ZCPR3.

My problem --> I can't seem to get the floppy to SYSGEN a new disk. Each
time I try it, the disk is accessed, then the terminal displays the message;
T 5 D 1 S 0000. If I put in another disk, the only thing that changes is the
number after the "T". I thought the problem might be that the system could
not write to the disk, but just PIPing files works ok.

Since the system came without manuals, I have a few questions.

1.  Does a standard SYSGEN for CP/M work with ZCPR3?

2.  Does T 5 D 1 S 0000 mean Track 5 Disk 1 Sector 0000? Is there anything I
    can do to continue the operation after this message appears? (So far,
    only ^C, which returns to the operating system, and RETURN, which
    repeats the message, seems to do anything.)

3.  Does anyone know where I can get some manuals for this computer?

Any information I could get would be greatly appreciated.

     I am the "download guru" for the Whole Earth 'Lectronic Link (public 
access UNIX system) in Sausalito, CA.  Recently several of the users here 
have asked me if there is any software available that runs under UNIX which 
will pack and unpack files in the MS-DOS ARC or CP/M-80 LIB formats.  After 
looking through the listing of public domain UNIX software from SIMTEL20 
and not finding any, I replied that I'd have to go ask the experts -- you.
 
     Can anybody help me here?

Now available from SIMTEL20...

Filename			Type	 Bytes	 CRC

Directory PD:<CPM.WSTAR>
ANYCODE2.LBR.1			BINARY	 10368  7AA3H

Despite its relative age, WordStar remains a popular word processing
tool, and it is still one of the most powerful word processors
available.  You can install WordStar to use virtually all of the
features of modern daisywheel printers to produce professional printed
documents of exceptional quality.  You can also install WordStar to
take advantage of many of the features of a sophisticated dot matrix
printer.  But there just aren't enough WordStar codes available to let
you use everything a dot matrix printer can do.

It would be convenient if you could simply enter the control
characters you want into the file the same way you enter codes that
WordStar knows about, but it isn't that simple.  WordStar filters your
document as it prints it, and any nonprintable characters that
WordStar doesn't recognize are rejected.

The original ANYCODE was written for the Osborne by Doug Hurst, to
circumvent this limitation.  Its function is to unlock all of the
features of a dot-matrix printer by providing a way to fool WordStar
into transmitting those control characters.  Doug's program is a patch
that is inserted logically between WordStar and the CP/M PRIMARY list
device - if you're not using the primary list device, this patch isn't
guaranteed to work.  The version under discussion here, written by
Dick Binder and named ANYCODE2, fixes a couple of limitations in the
original ANYCODE.

What ANYCODE2 does is to examine the printed stream, looking for
either of two characters that are set aside for it to use as lead-in
characters.  A "lead-in" character signifies that a special character
sequence follows, telling ANYCODE2 to begin processing.  Detection of
one of these characters will cause ANYCODE2 to transmit a control
character to the printer.  The control character is constructed from
the next two characters in the file.

ANYCODE2 is in 8080 code and can be assembled and installed into WS
using DDT under CP/M.  It goes into a special patch area provided and
does not increase the size of the WS.COM file.

Cheers,
Dick Binder   (The Stainless Steel Rat)

	Try looking in mod.sources, net.sources, and on simtel20 pd:<unix>
      or maybe it was pd:<cpm.unix>. I've got (un)crunching programs, library
      , .lbr files, programs and of course arc. All of the programs run under
      4.2 BSD, Encore Multimax UMAX 4.2 to be exact. They're all out there, you

I don't mind at all.  The files are here for everyone to access.
Internet users should use FTP rather than netmail.  FTP transfers the
files much faster and avoids placing additional load on the mailer.

The subject line is ignored by the fileserver.

The fileserver cannot answer requests which use a path that includes
seismo.  The most successful route is ucbvax because they have an
excellent program that properly formats the "From:" line of messages
coming through the gateway.

To obtain up to five files in a single request message by netmail from
the public domain archives kept on SIMTEL20.ARPA, send a message to:

ARCHIVE-REQUEST@SIMTEL20.ARPA

or via uucp:
   ...!ucbvax!simtel20.arpa!archive-request
   ...!uw-beaver!simtel20.arpa!archive-request
   ...!decwrl!simtel20.arpa!archive-request
   ...!lll-crg!simtel20.arpa!archive-request
   ...!ut-sally!simtel20.arpa!archive-request
   ...!harvard!simtel20.arpa!archive-request

[do NOT use host "seismo" - they are blocking messages from the server]

The message body must contain lines beginning with the keyword SEND,
one SEND line for each file requested.  Case is not significant.

The general syntax of a SEND line is:

SEND format filename

In general, a filename consists of the following components:

device:<directory>file.type.generation

"device:" is usually PD:, and the combination of PD:<directory> is
expected unless an alias has been advertised of the form "alias:",
which takes the place of both device and directory fields.  The
generation field should be left off in order to default to the highest
generation number so you can be sure of getting the latest version of
the file requested.  "file.type" follows the usual filenaming
conventions.

In all formats listed below, if the file to be sent is larger than
55K, the file is sent in numbered parts.  The parts must be
reassembled in order and edited to remove any headers, preface, and
trailers before the process can be reversed to reconstruct the
original file.

Allowable formats are:

SEND HELP
        This file you are reading now.

SEND INFO
        A detailed description of the SIMTEL20 Archives, which
        includes this file, pointers to certain key files, and
        descriptions of various file transfer programs and related
        utilities.

SEND BOOTSTRAP
        A brief quick reference listing of filenames of the key
        utilities used to reconstruct files sent by the compression
        and encoding techniques listed below.

SEND DIR filespec
        This format returns a CRC list of the requested files, and is
        the only format which allows wildcard filenames (but not
        wildcard directory names).  The list is sent as an ASCII text
        file.  The wildcard characters are "*" and "%".  The asterisk
        means any number of characters, while the percent sign means
        exactly one character.  Either or both may appear in any
        combination in either or both the file or type fields, while
        only the asterisk may appear in the generation field.

SEND RAW filename
        If the file is ASCII, it is sent as-is, regardless of size.
        This format is the least efficient over network and mail
        gateway resources.  Use this format only if you absolutely
        must.

With the four formats listed below, if the file is ASCII and under 25k
characters, it is sent as-is, as if RAW format was requested.  Binary
files are always processed according to the requested format.
However, a request for ARC or SQ processing of files with type ".ARC",
".LBR", or ".%Q%" is ignored and the original file is either uuencoded
or hexified (if possible), according to the requested format.  If the
file was not sent RAW, a short preface is inserted at the front of the
message describing the process actually taken and a CRC entry
describing the original file.

SEND ARE filename  or  SEND filename
        The original file is made into a uuencoded ARC file.

SEND ARH filename
        The original file is made into a hexified ARC file if the ARC
        file is under 64K bytes long.  Otherwise, an apology is
        returned instead of the requested file.

SEND SQE filename
        The original file is made into a uuencoded SQueezed file.

SEND SQH filename
        The original file is made into a hexified SQueezed file if the
        Squeezed file is under 64K bytes long.  Otherwise, an apology
        is returned instead of the requested file.

To get started in finding your way around the SIMTEL20 archives, send
a message to the server with the request: SEND INFO

     I have never had *anything* "break", although both my BDOS
( SUPRBDOS ) and my BIOS use the Z80 register set.  I would submit to you
that with the number of Z80 CP/M machines around vs. 8080 machines, any
program that assumes that the extra Z80 registers are inviolate is asking
for trouble.

     Why must the BIOS/BDOS save the registers?  You don't expect HL, or BC
to be preserved after a BDOS call, why should IX or IY be?

     BTW... has anyone noticed the following with SUPRBDOS?  Occasionally,
it will report 2 files with the same name on the same disk, although there
is only one.  It's never fatal, and never seems to show up unless SUPRBDOS
detects that you've swapped disks.

hello,

   I received c128-cpm.jql from archive-request last week. I had undecoded and
unsqueezed this file and read it. It seems very different information in
SIMTEL20 archives. Does anyone know this file from BBS?? I remeber that
some files in jul file don't exist in SIMTEL20 archives.

One of the best (and cheapest!) ways I have found for ASCII and text
files is to get a copy of the pd comm. program QMODEM (for the Clone)
and use an RS 232 link.  Quick and easy.  QMODEM has a very nice
download feature, that lets you capture everything that comes over
the serial line.  I have used this method with a Cromemco S-100
w/8" disks, and it works great.  In fact, the Cromemco uses an RS 232
device for the console, so the IBM (Clone) with QMODEM makes a great
DUMB TERMINAL from which I can run the S-100.  I have even gone as
far as DUMPing small .COM files, moving the dump text as above, and
then using a TURBO-PASCAL program on the clone to put them back in
binary.  You could do the same thing with HEXIFY/LOAD (assuming you
can transfer copies of those guys some other way first).  DUMP is a
rude and crude approach, but it's easy!

While I'm at it.....you'll need a good editor (I use a copy of micro-
EMACS I got from the C-user group pd software), and the pd disk utility
DT is pretty good for looking at the internals of files on the Clone.
Both are available for next to nothing.              Good luck.

	I think the easiest way is to do it is Kermit-Kermit file transfer.
I did this successfully when I made the switch from CP/M to PC-DOS.
Just connect serial ports together and go.  (You will probably have to
switch XMIT and RECV lines - 2&3)

Hello,

   I received some mails from info-cpm with BITNET%"SMTP@WISCVM" because of

   Or LISTSERV perhaps failed to correct form too. yes BItnet users can

RFC821 is for simple mail transfer protocol. RFC822 is for arpanet style

     I have never had *anything* "break", although both my BDOS
( SUPRBDOS ) and my BIOS use the Z80 register set.  I would submit to you
that with the number of Z80 CP/M machines around vs. 8080 machines, any
program that assumes that the extra Z80 registers are inviolate is asking
for trouble.

     Why must the BIOS/BDOS save the registers?  You don't expect HL, or BC
to be preserved after a BDOS call, why should IX or IY be?

     BTW... has anyone noticed the following with SUPRBDOS?  Occasionally,
it will report 2 files with the same name on the same disk, although there
is only one.  It's never fatal, and never seems to show up unless SUPRBDOS
detects that you've swapped disks.

I can convert files from 5.25" to 8" or 8" to 5.25" and CP/M (most any
format) to MS-DOS or MS-DOS to CP/M.  The only limitation is that I
can't easily handle single density disks  (Double or single SIDED makes
no difference).

If you're still interested, message me and we can discuss details.

ANYCODE3.LBR.1			BINARY	 10368  7E63H

This posting is a correction for the ANYCODE2 posting by Keith Petersen 
over the weekend.  Immediately after ANYCODE2 became available, Willie 
Smith found a bug in it.  He was kind enough to supply me with his fix, 
and the result is ANYCODE3.  The rest of this posting is the descriptive
announcement that accompanied the original posting.  Take note of my new 
network address, in the .signature at the end of this posting.  Email sent
to my old address as given in the ANYCODE3 documentation will still 
reach me.

*********

Despite its relative age, WordStar remains a popular word processing
tool, and it is still one of the most powerful word processors
available.  You can install WordStar to use virtually all of the
features of modern daisywheel printers to produce professional printed
documents of exceptional quality.  You can also install WordStar to
take advantage of many of the features of a sophisticated dot matrix
printer.  But there just aren't enough WordStar codes available to let
you use everything a dot matrix printer can do.

It would be convenient if you could simply enter the control
characters you want into the file the same way you enter codes that
WordStar knows about, but it isn't that simple.  WordStar filters your
document as it prints it, and any nonprintable characters that
WordStar doesn't recognize are rejected.

The original ANYCODE was written for the Osborne by Doug Hurst, to
circumvent this limitation.  Its function is to unlock all of the
features of a dot-matrix printer by providing a way to fool WordStar
into transmitting those control characters.  Doug's program is a patch
that is inserted logically between WordStar and the CP/M PRIMARY list
device - if you're not using the primary list device, this patch isn't
guaranteed to work.  The version under discussion here, written by
Dick Binder and named ANYCODE3, fixes a couple of limitations in the
original ANYCODE.

What ANYCODE3 does is to examine the printed stream, looking for
either of two characters that are set aside for it to use as lead-in
characters.  A "lead-in" character signifies that a special character
sequence follows, telling ANYCODE3 to begin processing.  Detection of
one of these characters will cause ANYCODE3 to transmit a control
character to the printer.  The control character is constructed from
the next two characters in the file.

ANYCODE3 is in 8080 code and can be assembled and installed into WS
using DDT under CP/M.  It goes into a special patch area provided and
does not increase the size of the WS.COM file.

Cheers,
Dick Binder   (The Stainless Steel Rat)

I have [had] the same problem (approximately - an Zenith AT clone 
and a CPM 3.0-like TurboDOS NorthStar Horizon.)  Both your and my 
systems have the same problem - your 8" floppies won't fit in the 
IBM drives (or at least not with using undo force :-) and the 
*hard*sectoring* of the NorthStar makes the 5-1/4 disks 
physically and mentally incompatible (sometimes I think I need a 
good divorce lawyer.)

So, put the two of them next to each other, run a nice 3 or 4 
wire cable between serial ports on each (pins 2,3,7, maybe 
reversing 2&3), obtain an commo program for each (preferabily 
with 'batch' capability) and transfer at the highest rate that 
they can manage.  My TurboDOS to Zenith connection runs at 38400 
baud (!), the NorthStar Advantage to Zenith a more prosetic 9600 
baud.  Text files worth best (natch) but there's no problem with 
binary files either - as long as you don't try to run programs on 
the wrong machine.

Works so good that I often download a batch of files to the 
Zenith, use pkarc to archive them, and then upload them back to 
the CP/M machine.  (I've might be called perverse - to me the IBM 
machine is the 'down' and the CP/M machine is the 'up'!)

A friend of mine has a Kaypro II which came bundled with the Perfect
line of software (Perfect Writer, Perfect Filer, etc) which is now out
of business.  He was recently given a Xerox 820-II and transferred the
software to 8" diskettes.  Here lies the problem.  The software doesn't
seem to work properly on the 820-II.  The Perfect manuals speak of
certain configuration programs which set the program  for the specific
host (setterm.com is one of them).  Unfortunately, Perfect did not
include them with the Kaypro, presumably to discourage someone from
passing the software to others.  If there's anyone out there who may
have these files, he sure could use them.

     Good luck on finding the manuals for MAC.  As long as you're looking,
see if you can find the manual set for RMAC, LINK, and LIB.  I'd like to
have those too.

     It's kind of ridiculous... we paid for legitimate copies of these
programs, but don't get the documentation necessary to make use of them.
DRI just shrugs their shoulders.

     WE DESERVE DOCUMENTATION!  Although why I expect DRI to change is beyond
me.

     Don't try to implement ZCPR3 on a 128... you'll be in for a *lot* of
heartache.  Maybe when 3.3 comes out, but not right now.  Find one of the
replacement OS, like CCP+ ( has anyone ever gotten that to work on a
banked CP/M+?

	I'm hunting for some programs for a Commodore 128 owner who is
suffering from CP/M anemia (his terminal program can't do 1200 baud!).
Anyone point me to a decent PD/Shareware terminal program and/or ARC
program that's accessible?  Like on the net, email, or GEnie?

Thanks

	joe piazza

For Northstar/DOS transfers you may be interested in a board put out
by the people who market UNIFORM--it fits in the PC and lets you read
Northstar CP/M diskettes in the PC drives.  It doesn't help if your
diskettes are in the Northstar DOS format, but otherwise it's incredibly
convenient.  I think it runs for about $200, which is a bit expensive.,
On the other hand, you can read/write/format the Northstar diskettes on
the PC, and as an added bonus, if you just want to work with the Northstar
data while your Northstar is doing something else, you don't even have to
transfer the data--the UNIFORM program will allow you to treat the Northstar
diskette as a PC diskette.  As an added bonus, the board also reads several
Apple II formats (including Apple CP/M).

There are several options open to people converting from CP/M machines
with 8" floppies to 5-1/4" MS-DOS diskettes.  The simplest is to contact
a disk conversion service.  Prices from transferring the data can be as
low as $7.50/disk, and you then have the exact files you had on the CP/M
diskettes.  The .COM files will be useless in their new environment, but
the data files may be used if the equivalent program exists under MS-DOS--
this is especially painless for people using WordStar and dBaseII.
    Another transfer method would be to get the 8" floppy disk controller
marketed by the people who make the UNIFORM CP/M disk reading software.
This costs about $200, fits into your PC-compatible machine, hooks up to
an 8" drive (presumably disconnected from the CompuPro) and you are ready
to read whatever is needed at your convenience. 
    A less expensive variation on the same these is to hook up a cable
between two machines and use some convenient file protocol to transfer
the files.  The eliminates the need for a special disk controller on the
PC end, but it can be a hassle figuring out the proper ports and making
the transfer work.
    If you have trouble using the data once it is transferred, send me
e-mail and I should be able to help--we have done hundreds of machines
over the past few years and usually know what we are looking at and how
to get from there to someplace else.

I can dig up the address of the publisher if you need it.

I've found UNIX versions of the programs I'd like under PD:<UNIX>.
But, there doesn't seem to be a PD:<TOPS-20> or PD:<CPM.TOPS-20>.

I'd like to have programs to UNSQUEEZE and perform operations on
LIBRARIES.  Also it would be nice to have a program to allow
downloading in a format understood by MEX---I'm having a lot of
trouble with the Kaypro versions of KERMIT and KERMIT is currently the
only thing available on our DEC-20.

Are there any such TOPS-20 programs available?  Where?

[spritzensparken!]
On Jan 15, I ordered several chips from Electronic Parts Outlet
(Scottsdale, Arizona) from their as in Computer Shopper.
Most of it arrived Jan 24.  Much to my dismay, several of the chips were
obviously removed from boards (scratched cases, bent leads, unsoldered
leads).  Neither the ad nor the catalogue mention that the parts are used.

On the bottom of the invoice
"all claims must be made within 5 days of receipt of material
15% restocking charge for all non-defective returns".

This means that I have 5 days to figure out if the sent me working chips!
I called them to ask how the parts are tested.
The fellow said that they test only the RAM chips, and they rarely get returns.
He they abruptly hung up.  This reduced my confidence since we didn't
like answering questions about the reliability of their products.
He didn't answer how I was to be confident in their delivered goods.
I asked him pleasantly, so he shouldn't have been offended
(ooops, this isn't soc.singles).

So, beware and be warned!

Subject: Re:  Point me to ARC and Terminal programs?

The files you seek are available in the public domain archives at
SIMTEL20.  They are located in the SIMTEL20 directories

	PD:<cpm.c128> and
	PD:<cpm.starter-kit>

The pd:<cpm.c128> directory contains two excellent pd terminal programs,
MEX and IMP, configured for a C128.

The following is a description of the public domain archives and how
to access them.


[ NETINFO:SIMTEL20.ARCHIVES ]				       [ 2/86, FP ]

                            THE SIMTEL20 ARCHIVES



SIGNIFICANT CHANGES

     New MSDOS archive added:  SIMTEL20 now has a new archive, PD:<MSDOS>.
This archive, like the PD:<PC-BLUE> archive, contains software for the MSDOS
and PCDOS operating systems.  But unlike PC-BLUE, this archive is locally
managed, and will be updated more often (the PC-BLUE archive is updated only
when new disks are issued by the PC-BLUE Users Group).  For a list of files,
get a copy of the directory file, PD:<MSDOS>MSDOS.CRCLST.


     Newsgroup correspondence archive files moved:  Newsgroup correspondence
archives have been moved from directory PS:<MAIL.ARCHIVES> to individual
directories having names of the form PS:<ARCHIVES.KEYWORD>, where "KEYWORD"
has been chosen to indicate the associated newsgroup.  See the section
entitled "NEWSGROUP CORRESPONDENCE ARCHIVES" for additional details.


     Public domain archive files moved:  A new large disk device called PD:
has been installed to house the entire public domain software collection.  All
files are now accessible using file specifications of the form:

			PD:<directory_name>file_name

Example:

			PD:<CPM.STARTER-KIT>LU310.COM


     New logical names:  Files in the <CPM> archive can also be specified with
a new shortened notation using a logical name for each directory.  Thus, the
file in the above example can also be specified as:

			STARTER-KIT:LU310.COM

Note that the part of the directory name following the dot has been used as
the logical name (followed by a colon).  But remember, this new form of file
specification applies only to the <CPM> archive.  To avoid confusion, all
examples in the text to follow will use the PD: specification, as this form
works with ALL of the archives.


     Getting started:  The above example provides a sneaky introduction to yet
another new feature that should greatly ease the "bootstrap phase" for new
archive users.  Now in one place, PD:<CPM.STARTER-KIT>, you will find all of
the basic essentials needed to begin using the archives.  These programs
provide the means for transferring, unsqueezing and de-librarying archive
files, and more will be said about them later in this document.  Special kudos
to archive maintainer Keith Petersen for this worthwhile addition.


     Finally, a reminder:  For quite some time now, "ITS binary format" has
not been used for storage of binary files in the SIMTEL20 archives.  If you
are a new user of the archives and you don't know what ITS binary format is,
don't worry about it; it no longer matters.  But apparently, some "veteran
archive users" are still unaware of the change.  Therefore, please note that
stripping the first four bytes of binary files, once necessary for removal of
the special "ITS header", is no longer required.  Indeed, if you do this now,
YOU WILL DESTROY THE FILES.



OVERVIEW

     There is a collossal amount of free public domain software for the CP/M,
PCDOS/MSDOS and UNIX operating systems, and for the DoD standard programming
language, Ada, in several archives on SIMTEL20.ARPA, a DECsystem-20 running
the TOPS-20 operating system at White Sands Missile Range.  Archives of
correspondence for several newsgroups, including INFO-CPM, are also available.

     You can obtain these files using the InterNet file transfer protocol, FTP
(described in a following paragraph), with user-name "anonymous".  For a login
password, use your host-name or any other string of printing characters.
Throughout this message, FTP examples are given in a GENERIC syntax.  You will
have to consult either local documentation or your friendly system wizard to
learn the actual syntax used with your local mainframe operating system.  For
the sake of brevity, the domain suffix ".ARPA" will be dropped from further
references to SIMTEL20 in this discussion.

     To obtain directory listings, connect to SIMTEL20 via FTP and do this:

                get pd:<cpm>cpm.crclst 
                get pd:<cpmug>cpmug.crclst 
                get pd:<sigm>sigm.crclst 
		get pd:<pc-blue>pc-blue.crclst 
		get pd:<msdos>msdos.crclst
		get pd:<unix>unix.crclst 
		get pd:<ada>ada.crclst

The <CPM> archive is the one to watch for the very latest CP/M offerings, as
it is updated frequently.  The <CPMUG>, <SIGM> and <PC-BLUE> archives contain
software distributed by the CP/M Users Group, the SIG/M Users Group and the
PC-Blue Users Group respectively.  This software is available on diskettes
from the associated users groups, and the archives are updated as new volumes
are issued.  The <PC-BLUE> archive contains software for the IBM-PC and
similar machines.  Some runs under CP/M, and some under PCDOS/MSDOS.  The
<MSDOS> archive also contains software for the MSDOS and PCDOS operating
systems; but this archive is locally managed, and therefore is updated more
frequently than the <PC-BLUE> archive.  The <UNIX> archive contains a variety
of UNIX tools.  Those which apply specifically to CP/M are in the directory
<UNIX.CPM>.  The <ADA> archive is growing rapidly.  Information about this
archive is in directory PD:<ADA.GENERAL>.  In general, the archived software
is very good, having been worked-over and refined by many users.  The
documentation and comments tend to be complete and informative.  Files in all
of these archives can be obtained using the FTP procedures described in this
message.

     But please note that due to the large number of files available, the
archive maintainers cannot possibly attempt to validate the proper operation
of the various programs.  When a program bug is reported, immediate action is
taken to either correct the error or remove the offending program from the
archives.  Still, users must understand that all archive programs are offered
AS IS, and the archive maintainers specifically disclaim any liability should
these programs malfunction or cause damage, incidental or otherwise.  When
testing ANY new software, be certain that all information stored on disk is
backed-up before you start, so that you can recover if files are damaged or
erased.  This is particularly true if you have a hard disk, in which case
malfunctions can be spectacularly disasterous.



FILE TYPES

     Files are stored in two formats:  Text files such as those with names
that end with DOC, HEX, INF and ASM are sometimes stored as ASCII files, but
usually these files are stored in binary squeezed form.  Binary storage is also
used for executable (COM) and library files.  Squeezed and library files are
described below.  All binary data are stored as four 8-bit bytes per 36-bit
SIMTEL20 word, with the low-order four bits of each word filled with zeros.
If such a file is interpreted as a contiguous string, as will happen if a
straight binary transfer is made to a 16 or 32-bit UNIX machine, the four zero
filler-bits per 36-bit group will cause rather bizarre and frustrating results.
The methods for dealing with this situation, which differ from machine to
machine, are explained in a following paragraph.

     Squeezed files have been compressed using programs available in directory
<CPM.SQUSQ> to obtain an approximate 35-percent size reduction.  These files
can be identified by the letter Q in the extension field.  For example, the
file PD:<CPM.ASMUTL>RMACPAT.AQM is a squeezed file.  It must be transferred
as a binary file, and then unsqueezed.  The unsqueezing can be done on a CP/M
system using USQ-xx.COM (where "xx" is the current version) from directory
<CPM.SQUSQ>, or there are several host-based unsqueezers in the <CPM> and
<UNIX> archives (see for example, directories <CPM.TOPS-20> and <UNIX.CPM>).

     CP/M library files (those with names ending in LBR) combine several
regular CP/M files into a single BINARY file which contains an internal
directory of its contents.  They are created using the CP/M library utility
LUxxx.COM (where "xxx" is the current version) or some other compatible
utility.  The complete packages for LUxxx and a newer compatible program
called NULUxx (where "xx" is the version) can be found in directory
PD:<CPM.CPMLIB>.  C-language source code for a compatible UNIX utility
called LAR (library archiver) is in directory PD:<UNIX.CPM>.

     Although the type of storage used for a particular file can usually be
inferred from the file-name, this is not always true.  It is a good idea to
check the appropriate "crclst" file to ascertain the storage format used for
each file of interest.  Now, and for the foreseeable future, storage formats
for files in the <SIGM>, <CPMUG> and <PC-BLUE> archives can be determined from
their "generation numbers", as shown by the FTP directory command.  For
example, the FTP command:

		dir pd:<pc-blue.vol001>

will yield results of the form:

		-CATALOG.001.2
		ABSTRACT.001.2
		BW.ASM.2
		BW.BAS.1
		BW.EXE.1
		COLOR.ASM.2
		COLOR.BAS.1
		COLOR.EXE.1
		...and so on

All files with names ending in ".1" are stored in binary format, and those
with names ending in ".2" are stored in ASCII.  This relationship will
continue to apply for files in the <SIGM>, <CPMUG> and <PC-BLUE> archives
until further notice.

     WARNING:  Because the public domain archives on SIMTEL20 consume a huge
amount of disk-space, storage capacity will be conserved by the greatest
practical use of libraries and squeezed files, both of which are stored in
binary format.  If you cannot properly transfer binary files, you are going to
be VERY FRUSTRATED!  If you need help, please contact your local system wizard
and provide him/her with a copy of this message.  Having done that, if you are
still unable to make things work correctly, send a message to INFO-CPM-REQUEST
at AMSAA.ARPA and I will try to help you.  Please provide the following
information:

	1. Machine and operating system  (e.g., VAX-11/780, 4.2 BSD UNIX)
	2. Network software in use  (e.g., 3-Com UNET)
	3. Complete list of available FTP commands  (e.g., GET, PUT, etc.)

     Important files in the <CPMUG> and <PC-BLUE> archives are the CATALOG
files.  These files, which are stored in ASCII, contain the "-CATALOG.nnn"
files from all the volumes of their respective archives.  To obtain these
composite catalog files, connect to SIMTEL20 via FTP and do this:

		get pd:<cpmug>cpmug.cat 
		get pd:<pc-blue.vol000>pcblue.cat 

A similar file exists for the <SIGM> archive, but it is stored in squeezed
form.  This file, when unsqueezed, yields SIG.CAT (the catalog).  It can be
obtained using the FTP command:

		get pd:<sigm.vol000>sig.cqt

(NOTE: That's "L-and-three-zeros" in "vol000")



FILE TRANSFER VIA FTP

     FTP stands for File Transfer Protocol, a formalized procedure for moving
files among machines on the Defense Data Network (DDN) and other networks that
connect with the DDN.  The protocol is implemented by a program often called
FTP.  The different mainframe operating systems implement FTP with variations
in command syntax.  Some systems have the remote-file-name precede the local-
file-name in the command.  Others reverse this order.  Some versions have the
whole command on a single input line, while others use multiple lines.  Read
the documentation for your local system, or consult a friendly system wizard
for the details of your local FTP command syntax.

     UNIX users can do something like "man ftp" for on-line instructions.
However, not all UNIX FTP programs are called "ftp", so you may have to snoop
around in the system directories or ask a system wizard for the correct local
name to use with the "man" command.  ITS users can do ":INFO FTP", and  "HELP
FTP" works on TOPS-20 and some other operating systems.  I will be happy to
update this message with pointers to other sources of on-line documentation if
they are sent to INFO-CPM-REQUEST@AMSAA.ARPA.

     FTP transfers from SIMTEL20 can be made with user-name "anonymous".  Use
your host-name or any other string of printing characters for a password.  For
anonymous logins, SIMTEL20 supports the FTP "change working directory" command.
(Your local syntax may be something like CD, or CWD.)  Ignore the message that
prompts you to enter a password.  This command allows you to specify a default
SIMTEL20 directory to be used for all file retrievals, and thereby relieves you
from having to repeatedly type "pd:<whatever>" as part of each filename.  For
example, you can do something like this:

		cd pd:<cpm.goodstuff>
		get filename-1
		get filename-2
		...and so on

instead of using the longer filename forms shown in previous examples.

     Users of TOPS-10, TENEX, TOPS-20 or ITS systems can use "image" or
"paged" mode for ALL transfers.  UNIX users must use "ascii" mode for ASCII
files, and "tenex" or "type L 8" mode for binary files.  MULTICS users can
use "ascii" mode for ASCII files, but binary files require special treatment
that is best described by the following example provided by Paul Schauble
<Schauble@mit-multics.arpa>:

    !ftp simtel20
     220 SIMTEL20.ARPA FTP Server Process 5Z(14)-7 at Mon 10-Sep-84 00:27-MDT

     user_ftp:  !login anonymous
     331 ANONYMOUS user ok, send real ident as password.
     Password:  !guest

     user_ftp:  !quote "type l 8" <--(NOTE: That's lowercase "L" 8.)
     200 Type L bytesize 8 ok.

     user_ftp:  !get micro:<cpm.zcpr3>alias.hlp alias.hlp
     150 Retrieve of MICRO:<CPM.ZCPR3>ALIAS.HLP.1 started.
     226 Transfer completed.
     Total elapsed time:  35.7 seconds.
     4348 bytes transferred in 18.5 seconds (1850 bits/sec).

     user_ftp:  !quit
     221 QUIT command received. Goodbye.

Lines beginning with "!" are typed by the terminal user.  The received files
are stored on MULTICS with one 8-bit byte per 9-bit word, and can be trans-
ferred to a microcomputer with Kermit (described in a following paragraph).

     All aspects of the FTP process for UNIX machines have been automated to
a high degree by a program in directory PD:<UNIX.CPM>.  With this program,
a simple command like "mb modm700.com" can connect to SIMTEL20 and transfer
the binary file "modm700.com" from directory PD:<CPM.MODEM7> to a local file
also named "modm700.com", all with no user intervention.  Batch command files
containing multiple lines of the form in the above example can be run in
no-hangup background mode to transfer whole directories without the user even
remaining logged-in on his local system.  For more information, get the file
PD:<UNIX.CPM>AUTOFTP.DOC.



PROGRAMS FOR TRANSFERRING FILES AMONG MAINFRAMES AND MICROS

Christensen Protocol Mainframe Programs:

     For a micro to reliably exchange files with a mainframe, cooperating
file transfer programs with automatic error detection and retransmission of
faulty blocks must be running on both computers.  One such family of programs
uses a popular protocol created by Ward Christensen and enhanced by others.  
Directory PD:<UNIX.CPM> contains two programs, UC and the older UMODEM
(both written in C), which implement this protocol on UNIX machines.  See the
file PD:<UNIX>UNIX.CRCLST for a list of other useful UNIX utilities.

     On ITS machines, file transfer using the Christensen protocol can be done
using MMODEM (type :MMODEM for instructions), or LMODEM.  Documentation for
LMODEM is in file .INFO.;LMODEM HELP.  Other useful ITS utilities include:

	TYPE8  - types an ASCII file stored in ITS binary format.
	TYPESQ - types an ITS binary format "squeezed" file (see the first
	         paragraph under FILE TYPES).
	USQ    - creates an unsqueezed version of a squeezed file.
	HEXIFY - creates an Intel hex format file from an ITS binary format
	         COM file.
	COMIFY - creates a COM file from an Intel hex file.
	CRC    - computes the Cyclic Redundancy Check value for a file, using
	         the same algorithm that is used by the CP/M program CRCK.

Brief instructions for any of these utilities except LMODEM can be obtained by
typing ":utility_name" (for example, :CRC).

     The ITS utilities listed above are also available for use with TOPS-20,
but since ITS binary format is no longer being used for the SIMTEL20 archives,
these utilities have been converted to work with TOPS-20 binary formats.  A
collection of TOPS-20 utilities for transferring and manipulating files can be
found in directory PD:<CPM.TOPS-20>.  See PD:<CPM>CPM.CRCLST for a list of
available programs.

     File transfer and conversion utilities for use with VAX/VMS machines are
contained in directory PD:<CPM.VAXVMS>.  See CPM.CRCLST for details.


Christensen Protocol Microcomputer Programs:

     An excellent program for transferring files between micros, or between
micros and mainframes is called MODM7xx, where the "xx" is replaced with two
digits to give the current version number.  This program, often referred to as
MODEM7 (the name of its easier to pronounce ancestor), uses the popular
Christensen protocol to transfer files with automatic error detection and
retransmission of erroneous blocks.  

     To get started with MODM7xx, you should first FTP and examine the "DOC"
and "MSG" files from the binary library file PD:<CPM.MODEM7>MODM7xx.LBR.
The "DOC" and "MSG" files are actually stored in the library in squeezed
form, so you will have to perform three steps to get them:

	1. FTP the binary library file.
	2. Extract the elements having filename extensions of "DQC" and "MQG".
	   If you have no facilities for doing this on your mainframe host
	   (see the earlier comments on mainframe-based library utilities),
	   then you will have to transfer the library to a microcomputer and
	   extract the necessary elements there.  If this requirement seems to
	   put you in a "Catch-22" situation because you have no facilities
	   for mainfrome-to-microcomputer transfers, there is a way out; read
	   the "Getting Started" section which follows|.
	3. Use an "unsqueezer" (described above) to convert the "DQC" and
	   "MQG" files extracted from the library into "DOC" and "MSG" files.
	   As in the case of the library extractions, unsqueezing can be done
	   on either a mainfrome host or a microcomputer, depending on your
	   circumstances.

Together, these files will tell you just about all there is to know about
getting MODM7xx to run on your machine.  Take the time to read them; they're
quite informative.  You will also get some helpful insights from reading some
of the overlay files.  These overlays, described in file PD:<CPM.MODEM7>
M7OVL-yy.LST, are used to customize MODM7xx for particular machines without
having to edit and assemble the huge MODM7xx source file.  Complete
instructions for performing this procedure are contained in each overlay file.
The letters "yy" in the above filename should be replaced with two digits
giving the current version number as determined from CPM.CRCLST.

     And then, there is MEX.  MEX stands for "modem executive", and it is just
what the name implies, a communications and file-transfer program with a
built-in mini operating system that runs under CP/M.  This program can do file
transfers using either the Christensen or Compuserve protocol, and it has an
enormous potential for highly automated operations because it can read and
execute command-scripts pre-stored in disk files.  These scripts can include
sending commands to a remote computer, as if they had been sent manually from
the microcomputer in terminal-mode.  Users of this relatively new program are
still exploring its possibilities.  For more information, look in CPM.CRCLST
under the heading "PD:<CPM.MEX>", and then get the various files that have
"DQC" and "IQF" in their names.  These DOCumentation and INFormation files are
stored in squeezed form (note the "Q" in the filename extensions), so you will
have to unsqueeze them.  Overlays for MODM7xx will also work with MEX, but
they will not provide all of the extended MEX features.
 

Kermit:

     Another excellent program for transferring files is called KERMIT.  This
program has the advantage of being available for an impressively large number
of mainframes and micros.  It is, for example, available for the IBM-PC, and
it DOES NOT require CP/M.

     To get started with KERMIT, connect to CU20B.ARPA using FTP, and do this:

		get ker:aaaread.me

Note that this file is NOT on SIMTEL20, and the name is subject to change.
If you cannot find a file with this name, snoop around in the first half-
dozen or so files in the alphabetical listing obtainable using the FTP
DIRectory command.  You should find something useful.

     Questions can be addressed to INFO-KERMIT-REQUEST at CU20B.ARPA.


Getting Started:

     In order to get MODM7xx, MEX or KERMIT running on your micro, you must
first transfer the necessary files from mainframe to micro.  If you already
have a receive-to-disk communications program of some sort, you can use it to
move the needed files.  In the long-run it is essential to be able to transfer
8-bit binary files, but initially it is not absolutely necessary.  Some of
the files are quite large.  For example, MODM7xx.COM is over 18K bytes, and
the HEX file (which you will need if you can't transfer 8-bit files) is over
45K.  Moving large files to your micro without using an error detecting
protocol can result in frustrating errors, but it can be done by receiving
multiple copies and using manual or machine-assisted comparisons to locate and
repair bad parts of the code.  However, there IS a better way.

     Directory PD:<CPM.STARTER-KIT> contains a short starter-program called
PIPMODEM.ASM that can be FTPed to your mainframe, printed, and then entered
into your microcomputer by hand and assembled.  This can then be used to down-
load either MBOOT3.ASM or BMODEM.BAS (depending on whether you prefer assembly
language or BASIC), both of which can receive files using the error detecting
Christensen protocol.  Once you have this capability, you can download the
full-function file transfer program of your choice.  To examine this option,
connect to SIMTEL20 via FTP and do this:

		get pd:<cpm.starter-kit>pipmodem.asm 
		get pd:<cpm.starter-kit>pipmodem.doc 
		get pd:<cpm.starter-kit>mboot3.asm 
		get pd:<cpm.starter-kit>bmodem.bas
		get pd:<cpm.starter-kit>bmodem.doc




All are ASCII files.  Read PIPMODEM.DOC first, then look at MBOOT3.ASM and
BMODEM.DOC.  PIPMODEM.DOC explains the situation very nicely.  Questions
concerning these programs should be sent to INFO-CPM@AMSAA.ARPA (NOT to
INFO-CPM-REQUEST).



NEWSGROUP CORRESPONDENCE ARCHIVES

     Copies of correspondence for several newsgroups are kept on SIMTEL20 in
directories with names of the form PS:<ARCHIVES.KEYWORD>, where "KEYWORD" has
been chosen to indicate the associated newsgroup.  At present, the following
correspondence archives are available:

		   newsgroup		   mail archive filename
		---------------		   ---------------------
		ADA-SW			   PS:<ARCHIVES.ADA-SW>
		AMETHYST-USERS		   PS:<ARCHIVES.AMETHYST>
		INFO-68K		   PS:<ARCHIVES.68K>
		INFO-APPLE		   PS:<ARCHIVES.APPLE>
		INFO-CPM		   PS:<ARCHIVES.CPM>
		INFO-FORTH		   PS:<ARCHIVES.FORTH>
		INFO-HAMS		   PS:<ARCHIVES.HAMS>
		INFO-MICRO		   PS:<ARCHIVES.MICRO>
		INFO-MODEM7		   PS:<ARCHIVES.MODEM7>
		INFO-MODEMXX		   PS:<ARCHIVES.MODEMXX>
		INFO-MODULA-2		   PS:<ARCHIVES.MODULA-2>
		NORTHSTAR-USERS		   PS:<ARCHIVES.NORTHSTAR>
		INFO-PASCAL		   PS:<ARCHIVES.PASCAL>
		UNIX-SW			   PS:<ARCHIVES.UNIX-SW>
		INFO-XENIX310		   PS:<ARCHIVES.XENIX310>

Descriptions of these and other newsgroups can be obtained via FTP with
anonymous login (as for SIMTEL20) from the Network Information Center's host
SRI-NIC.ARPA.  Ask for the file PS:<NETINFO>INTEREST-GROUPS.TXT (an ASCII
file).  And please note, this is NOT on SIMTEL20.

     File names for SIMTEL20 newsgroup correspondence archives have two
forms.  For example, PS:<ARCHIVES.CPM>CPM.ARCHIV.ymmdd  is a group of files
containing INFO-CPM correspondence going back several years.  The characters
"ymmdd" in the file names are actually digits giving the year, month and day
of the last message in each particular file.  Current correspondence is kept
in the file PS:<ARCHIVES.CPM>CPM-ARCHIV.TXT, which is constantly changing.
Although INFO-CPM has been used as an example here, the same naming scheme
is used for the other newsgroup files as well.  For a complete list of
available files, connect to SIMTEL20 via FTP and do this:

		dir ps:<archives>

You will receive a list of names of the form:

		KEYWORD.DIRECTORY.n

where "n" is one or more digits.  For example, the INFO-CPM listing currently
appears as "CPM.DIRECTORY.1"  To then get a list of files in a particular
archive, do this:

		dir ps:<archives.keyword>

where "keyword" (for example, "cpm") is chosen from the preceding list, and
the word "directory" and the number "n" are not used.  At present, all of
these files are stored in ASCII.

We are making a transition from an Otrona CPM system to an MSDOS
environment.  We have found two software products useful.  We
purchased MultiMedia, a utility which permits one drive of an MSDOS
system to be configured into one of about 60 diffent systems including
about 20 CPM systems.  (Apple not included).  We also use the public
domain software from SIMTEL20 which permits the Emulation of an 8080
on the MSDOS system.  Not all CPM programs are compatible.  Our
favorite, NewSweep, has sone non-standard calls to bdos and will not
work.  Many do.
  I have mixed emotions about MSDOS, as the CPM world did most of the
things which I required on a daily basis. and as someone else has
said, Anyone can make a computer dance with a meg of memory.  Real
programmers do it in 8 bits.  LONG LIVE CPM.

The public domain CP/M archives at SIMTEL20.arpa contain a directory named
PD:<CPM.C128> which contains all that you want and more (e.g. IMP and MEX
for the 128 which will run very nicely at 1200 baud, and the necessary BIOS
to support modem, if you don't already have it).  Other programs like UNARC
can be had in generic form from other directories under PD:<CPM>, and the
generic versions will work very well on the 128.  Only those programs which
have machine specific overlays or are adapted specifically for the 128 are
in PD:<CPM.C128>.  Those not on the Defense Data Network should use the
Archive Mail Server facility at SIMTEL20 to retrieve directory listings and
files; those on DDN can FTP directly from SIMTEL20 (currently after 4PM
Mountain Time) using ANONYMOUS login.

UNIFORM, by Matchpoint(?) Solutions in Illinois, is very much NOT
shareware (although some other program MAY be).  Despite that, it is
absolutely the best program in the genre,allowing the user to not
only read/write/format some 200 (not 60) CP/M disk formats, but to
put the actual CP/M disk in the PC and work off of it as though it
were a PC disk.  The company also markets a board to read Apple &
Northstar disks, and a third board that can run 8" and 3-1/2" and
AT disks off of an XT (also an AT).  They make good equipment,
and have good support.  Their phone number is (815) 756-3411.
    The program generally sells for around $50 (the boards around
$150).

I'm looking for a version of Kermit that will run on the CP/M 2.2 operating
system used by the Toshiba T-100.  Toshiba sold about 3,000 of these machines
during 1982-1983.  The serial i/o port on this machine differs from many
of the other CP/M machines still in existence. I've tried running Generic
CP/M Kermit on the T-100, but had no results.

If anybody knows of a successful implementation of Kermit on a T-100, I'd
appreciate the information.  

The problem that I've experienced concerns the design of the T-100. The 
machine originally cost $800, but was shipped with no detailed descriptions
of the computer. Toshiba offered to sell some users an advanced technical
manual for the T-100, but they wanted to charge $250!

Toshiba sold a communication program with the T100. The program was
called WhizLink and had a number of bugs. I've been unable to get this
program to transfer files over Telenet. WhizLink was based on the
xmodem protocol for transferring files.

If you have any information about transferring files using the Kermit
or xmodem protocols with the Toshiba T100 please contact me.

believe that a driver for the Uni-disk is listed on SIMTEL20

Also, if PD, I don't know where you would get it from.  It is not on SIMTEL20.

Many of the public domain and/or copyrighted programs that I have

format.  I would like to avoid having to buy WORDSTAR just to print
these files.  Is there a program on simtel20 that can format and 
print these files. I know about clearing the high order bit, but that 
doesn't format the text.  Thanks in advance.

There are a number, but the best one I've found is called "Z80MU" by
Joan Riff of ComputerWise Consulting Services, P. O. Box 813, McLean,
Va. 22101.  It is available from a number of "public domain copying
services" for $3-$6.  Check out the ads in Computer Shopper (esp. the
last 50 pages).  Computer shows are another excellent source of pd
software.  
I got a catalog from MicroCornucopia (P. O. Box 223, Bend, OR 97709)
last night, showing a pd disk (MS-DOS#22) with a CP/M emulator that
makes use of the V-20 subset of 8080 instructions to run 8080 CP/M
stuff.  They ask $8 per disk for non-subscribers, and $6 otherwise.
The emulators that use the 8088 instruction set (like Z80MU) are slow
because they execute many 8088 op codes to emulate one Z-80 op code.
Z80MU claims to match the performance of a 1MHz Z-80.  The V-20
emulators are faster because they execute 8080 op codes as a part of
their instruction set, but they limit you to programs written for the
8080.
Get a copy of Z80MU and try it out.  I use it on a clone, and it works
just fine.  If you can't locate a copy, contact me and we can arrange
to copy it for you, however I'm not set up to be able to make lots of
copies.

Subject: Digest redistribution in Bitnet-land

As I'm sure those of you on Bitnet have figured out by now, digest
distribution to you is being handled by a list-server to cut down
on the network traffic through the Wisconsin gateway.  If you care,
it is an FREPC11-style LISTSERV machine.

At any rate, for most of you the list-server does not know your name,
so the mail you receive says 'To:   "(no name)"  <user@node>'.  You may
change that by sending the command

       SUBSCRIBE DIST-CPM  your real name
-or-   SUBSCRIBE DIST-MDM  your real name

(for the Info-CPM and Info-Modems lists, respectively) to LISTSERV@RPICICGE.
The command can be sent either as a RFC822 mail file or as an interactive
message.  (For VM systems, interactive messages can be sent with the TELL
command as in

      TELL LISTSERV AT RPICICGE SUBSCRIBE DIST-CPM John S. Fisher

Similar commands exist for MVS and JNET sites.  I don't know about the
others.)  Users with userids longer than eight characters (eg VAX) MUST
use the mail approach since interactive messages carry the userid
truncated to eight.

The list-server is a littly picky about names; "your real name" must
include at least two tokens.  Just first names or just last names
are rejected.


If you have any problems related to the list-server, please direct them
to me for fastest response.  (Carbon-copy to INFO-xxx-REQUEST is probably
a reasonable thing to do, also....)


And last:  DO NOT SEND ANY CORRESPONDENCE TO EITHER dist-cpm OR dist-mdm.
           Continue to use the INFO-xxx addresses in Arpanet.

I have a friend with a R/S Model II running P&T CP/M.  He also has
seven reels of 2400' 9-TRK 1600 BPI tape data he needs to read to
extract selected records to build a database.  He has already used a
tape-to-disk conversion service to convert one tape at a cost of
$50/hr for four hours of conversion time.  At that rate, he now
figures he should be able to invest in buying the hardware he would
need to do the conversion himself, break even now, and be ahead for
future conversions.  The question is: who still makes such hardware
for his machine?
