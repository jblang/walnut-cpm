Here excerpts of a letter from Robert Heller.[Heller@UMASS-CS.CSNET]

Enclosed find 5 disks.  Each disk has one set of files which go
together into a single directory or maybe a directory tree.

DISK1:"KMINCE"

This disk contains a collection of enhancements to MINCE 2.6 for
CP/M-68K.  These enhancements mostly consist of a set of funtions to
bind the keys of numeric keypad of various "smart" terminals,
including VT52's, VT100's,H19's, Z29's and VI50's (other terminal
types can be easily added).  Other enhancements include: mode line
processing (the funny lines with the -*-"'s), paren and curly-brace
flashing in C mode, keyboard macros and some hooks for lisp mode and
electric-c mode.

DISK2: "UTILS"

This disk contains a collection of assorted utilities for CP/M-68K.
There is a file type .MAN for each utility.

DISK3:"SYSHACKS":

This disk contains a collection of random fixes to CP/M-68K 1.2.
These fixes include: a patched version of parsefn.o {from CLIB} that
correctly handles drive P, a patched version of ccp.o (from CPMLIB)
that has the ERA command disabled (a separate program replaces the ERA
command and is included), an alternative version of access.o (from
CLIB( which correctly handles mode 2 (write access).  ALso included
are a pair of documents describing a couple of patches to Stride's
CP/M BIOS.

DISK4:"ROFF4.1.61":

This disk contains a version of ROFF4.1.61 (a PD text processor)
converted to run under CP/M-68K.

DISK5: "SNOBOL4":

This disk contains a SNOBOL4-like pattern matcher along with some
utilities and game progams translated from programs in "Algorithms in
SNOBOL4" by James Gimple.  Included is a poker playing game.

......   I  just  stuffed all his 'disks' into LBR-files with Squeezed
members [hoping that CP/M-68K guys would know about SQueeze and LU --
or at least something similar] -- also most of his stuff would work
{with minor changes on CP/M}.

   I found out why I was having problems with COMFCB undefined errors, but
after solving that problem and successfully assembling BYE507, it still
locks up upon executing.  Nothing happens -- no messages or activity from
the modem -- just locks up right away.  Help.

Subject: Help requested - CCS 2805 Wallclock programming

Does anybody have a time-and-date set and/or read routine for the 
CCS 2805 Wallclock / Terminator board?  I have a partial  manual, 
but  this  includes no software listings or method  examples  for 
the Clock section.  I would like to in particular implement  this 
with   Plu*Perfect's   DateStamper,    but   according   to   the 
documentation, before I can use DateStamper, I must set it with a 
user-provided set routine. Lacking anything save the board itself 
and a general idea of what the function of the hardware,  I could 
no  doubt  guess at a date and time set routine in time,  but  it 
would be a lot easier if anybody out there has done anything with 
the board already.
                    Thanks in advance,
 
                         Kevin Belles

Since then, I've found a bit more of the manual, but it appears to have been 
written by a refugee from the IBM School of Technical Writing. :-}

To K. Petersen and others:

I hope I'm not asking the overly obvious but here goes...

The "New Files" message just sent out over the net demonstrates a problem I
have that there may already be a solution to:

How do you find out what any one of these particular programs, library files,
etc actually is - is there a "one line description" for listed files somewhere
that says even as little as "xmodem program for CPM APPLE II", or "Terminal
driver for ACME PCs"... you get the picture.  Without such a blurb, the only
possible clue for what a file may be is the directory its kept in, which is a
very general catigorizing of things at best.

Any suggestions?

Thanks!

Subject: New files uploaded to SIMTEL20

A description of the new files uploaded during the month of May will
be forthcoming.  It takes time to put that together.  Rather than
make everyone wait, I elected to send a list of filenames in case
people had been looking for new versions of programs they are familiar
with.

We have a tremendous number of files in the Simtel20 repository.  It
is going to take some time to make brief descriptions of each and
every file, but that IS the goal.  Meantime, I will be sending out
monthly descriptions of new files.

Subject: Answer: 2 Computers -> 1 Printer!
To: info-cpm@AMSAA.ARPA
Cc: info-micro@simtel20.ARPA, rbloom@apg-1.ARPA

I had asked the net how to connect 2 computers to 1 printer 
directly, without use of a AB switch.  Users act as flow control 
so that both don't print at one time.  Michael Neary 
<MNeary.es@Xerox.COM> gave me the answer which worked:

     Yes, all you probably need is a couple of diodes, and maybe 
     a couple of resistors.

     Place a resistor (about 4.7K to 15K) in parallel with each 
     diode.  A diode goes in series with pin 3 (TXD) from each 
     computer.  Join the <cathodes> together and hook this to the 
     printer.

     I am assuming that the 'receive' level translator in the 
     printer will need some bias current to establish a '0' 
     level.  If it doesn't, then the resistors would be 
     unnecessary.

     The nice thing about RS232 is that I have never seen anybody 
     break RS232 unless they apply external voltages to it.  It 
     seems incapable of hurting itself.  :-)

For those mechanical types that can't read words (like me)  and 
need a picture to see what's going on, here's the picture:

                                 /---|<|---\   
                        /-------<           >---- computer
                       /         \--xxx---/    
        printer ------<        
                       \        /---|<|---\
                        \------<           >---- computer 
                                 \--xxx---/    

--xxx-- is the resistor (I used 10k)

--|<|-- is the diode (the marked end is to the left, towards printer

Above fiddling is done on RS232 pin 3.  I made all others 
straight through.  The diodes and resistors were from my spare 
parts drawer, the diodes weren't even matched.  I don't know the 
part numbers either.  But it's working so I won't mess or argue 
with success ...

Thanks Mike,

    I'll leave it to someone else to tell you about ARC.  The SQ/UNSQ
family of programs use adaptive Huffman coding and is available (often
with source) for just about any machine.  SIMTEL20 can provide a C
version that has been deliberately aimed at portability (moving it to a
C/70 with 10-bit bytes required only some masks).  There are also
assembly language versions, Pascal, etc.  Even if you want to write your
own program, the SQ/UNSQ format has been "beat on" enough so it is
fairly solid (like XMODEM or KERMIT).  One thing to watch in picking
your implementation - Huffman coding can expand short files (due to the
table of Huffman codes).  Make sure the version you pick up checks
whether or not it is worth sqeezing the file.

    now, will someone describe ARC?

    Tried to snarf MAPSTATC.LBR in TURBOPAS: and got a littul problum...
    Lots of .%Z% files, and only a CP/M CRUNCH program to uncrunch them.
    So if I ain't got CRUNCH for an MS-DOS machine (no C compiler), and no
    CP/M system running right now with communications .. how do I get that
    code?  Is there an UNCRUNCH equivalent for the DEC20s so I can do it
    on the host?  Not likely ARC can do anything with them, and I just
    don't have the time right now to write an UNCRUNCH for MS-DOS...

There is no CRUNCH/UNCRUNCH for MSDOS yet.  I have uploaded a version
with squeezed files.  As you can see, there's quite a difference in
the "crunched" (Lempal-Zev) and "squeezed" (Hoffman) file sizes.  The
two LBRs contain the same programs.

Manasseh,

I've been using Aztec 1.06D/CPM-80 professionally for over a year.  It
is a quality product, produces reasonable code and works very
predicatably.  The CP/M-86 I also understand to be quality products to.
There are several reviews over the last year or two in various magazines
(I'm not sure of issue dates but try BYTE and Computer Language)

Subj: Who (mis)uses Z80 registers?
Date: Fri, 06 Jun 86 12:23:50 PDT
From: bridger@RAND-UNIX.ARPA


In the 8080 world, a program assumes that the cpu registers may get used
by the BIOS or (B)DOS.  If the program needs the register contents, it
saves them before calling the operating system.

By extension, a Z80 program should expect that the operating system
could use the Z80 (ix,iy, af', bc', de', hl') registers.  If the
application program is actively using these registers, it should save
their contents as well before calling the BIOS/BDOS.
(Of course, the operating system is responsible for saving
its own z80 or 8080 register values if it needs them between calls).

But not all programs do so, and such programs may crash quite obscurely.

Do you know of specific programs that fall in this category?  I do know
that the CDL linker is one.  Someone has suggested that some of the
Pascal and Modula-2 compilers (and the code they generate???) are
suspect.

Thanks for pointers & further discussion.

Filename			Type	 Bytes	 CRC

Directory PD:<CPM.CATLOG>
KPRTLSTP.LBR.1			BINARY	 27776  1137H

This is a modified KPRTLST program that will print a formatted
3-across page, diskfile, or display to CRT the contents of the
MAST.LST file.  The MAST.LST file is generated by running the
XCAT.COM utility on your MAST.CAT file

THIS VERSION IS FOR KAYPRO 10 WITH A LEGACY CLOCK BOARD ONLY!!!

The KPRTLST+.BAS files are included for users who need to set the
clock port equates for the KP2/4 Legacy clock board.

Requires Digital Research's CB80/LK80 to compile & link.

If you don't have a clock then see the PRNLST13.LBR and get either
KPRTLST.CQM or PRNLST13.CQM instead.

The author found the standard hardcopy generated by XCAT to be a big
paper-waster.  He has over 5100 files in his MAST.CAT and it used to
take 60 or more pages to printout.  KPRTLST will only referrence the
first disk id# after the filename and then formats the listing
3-across per line and a full page.  It may also be told to generate
the MASTER.LST diskfile in the same format.  And you can always use it
to just display on the CRT first to see what the formatting looks
like.

A bug in vers 1.2 that made the program barf when it encountered an
overrun line of nothing but disk id#'s from a previous filename has
been fixed.  It now skips these lines and moves on to process the next
filename.

The <A> command has been added to look for an abort character entered
from the keyboard during printing or diskfile creation.

During diskfile creation, KPRTLST will tell you what line# it is
currently writing so you don't think it went to lunch when there's no
visible activity going on the screen.

Subject: Misusing Z80 registers


If you assume that a program should save the ix, iy, af', etc registers
before calling the operating system, then Turbo Pascal falls into the
catagory of misusing registers.  It expects the index registers to be saved
by the operating system, which, unfortunately, my VT180 does not do.  This
causes the find and replace operations in the turbo editor to fail.

Now available from SIMTEL20:

Filename			Type	 Bytes	 CRC

Directory PD:<CPM.TURBOPAS>
PMLINK.LBR.1			BINARY	 26240  ABF1H

PMLINK holds a 'close relative' to:

Directory PD:<MSDOS.TURBO-PASCAL>
INLINE.ARC.1			BINARY	 34124  82DDH

Both make inclusion of 'inline code' for TURBO easier. INLINE supports
MSDOS, PMLINK supports CP/M - although it shouldn't be too involved to
convert PMLINK for MSDOS.

Differences between the two:

1. PMLINK is distributed with source { MC June 1986 translated by me}

2. PMLINK takes Microsofts REL-format and generates 'inline' code ,
   whereas INLINE tries to do the 'assembly' itself.

3. PMLINK is 'superfast' - although thats of minor importance - more
   important is usage of REL format, which is pretty close to OBJ format.

...another nice piece of TURBO .. and another nice example how to speed
up TURBO's already impressive performance.

Bernie.

Since somebody asked about differences between Huffman encoding and
ARC [or whats the difference between a cherry and an apple-pie] - I
decided to give my 'two cents' worth. There are LONG articles and
dissertations floating around -- but who reads them...

		A mini-introduction into ARC

ARC in some way is comparable to LSWEEP or LU in that it is a
PACKAGING method.  Files with extension ARC contain a 'marker',
followed by file information, file-data, file information, file-data
etc.

ARC's packaging method guarantees NO GROWTH during storage , i.e.
file contents are analyzed before storage and either stored

1. AS IS {typically files in the 1 to 200 byte range}
2. with repeat-compression {same range as above}
3. using Huffman 8-byte encoding {sometimes executables}
4. using Lempel-Ziv-Welch encoding {all others}

ARC free's the user from 'worrying' about storage mechanisms and
delivers practically all needed services {extract, store, list, type,
check, execute and re-compress using 'latest' state of compression
technique}.  ARC is 'downward' compatible.  It is currently heavily
used in the MSDOS/PCDOS world, although usage in RCPM systems is
starting with availability of a fast DE-ARCer {a CP/M version of ARC
is 'in the works' by Bob Freed}.

ARC belongs into the category of "Share-ware" or "Free-ware" - it is
copyrighted by System Enhancement Associates {source-language C,
system MSDOS} - UnARC was written by Bob Freed for the Public Domain
{source-language assembler, system CP/M}.

		A mini comparison of Huffman Encoding
				 and
		  Lempel-Ziv-Welch {LZW} techniques

Huffman Encoding expresses each storage unit as a variable length
pointer into a frequency-ordered tree.  Compression is achieved by
choosing a 'native' storage unit {where repetitions are bound to
occur} and {on the average} expressing the more frequent storage units
with shorter pointers [although less used units might be presented by
longer pointers].  The Encoding process needs 'two passes' i.e.  once
reading all units {under CP/M and MSDOS 8bit bytes} to build the
frequency ordered tree {also called the 'dictionary'} and then
translating all units into their respective pointer values.  Original
filename, dictionary and pointer values are stored - by convention the
SECOND character of the filename extension is changed to Q - reminder
of a 'squeezed' file.

LZW expresses strings of 8-bit bytes by pointers into an 'ordered'
string-table.  The rules for 'constructing' the table are reversible,
so that Compressor and De-Compressor can 'build' their table
'on-the-fly'.  LZW is 'one-pass' although  achieved  speed is VERY
dependent on language implementation and available physical memory [in
general more than 90% of time spent in 'hashing' and table searching].
Although early implementations of LZW seemed to need more than 64K of
physical memory, current enhancements make a maximum of 2**11 table
entries sufficient to handle all cases.  State of the art
implementations check 'compression ratio' on the fly - and rebuild the
table if compression ratio decreases beyond a minimum or rebuild the
table on table overflow.

Typical Huffman compression ratios hover around 33% {compressed file
is 66% of original, whereby 'text' is typically compressed a little
better, and 'executables' less}.  Typical LZW compression ratios
average 55% - highest compression is achieved with pixel-information
{values of 90% are typical} - followed by 'text' with 50% and
executables around 20%.  Although the original 'paper' on LZW
suggested implementation between CPU and peripheral devices
[terminal,disk-drives,mag-tapes] - current usage encompasses
file-compression {Unix COMPRESS, MSDOS ARC, CPM UNArc} - highspeed
proprietary MODEM-protocols {"LZW in SILICON"} and 'picture
transmission' at 1200 baud.

Rgds,
Bernie

Keith (and all),
   Numerous times I have picked up the phone and called authors of
various BYEs and inserts, and do you know how much money I have
wasted?  Flame mode off please; I was just a little frustrated,
with what I think was good reason.

   In any case, these have been the two main problems.  First, the
B5AS-1 insert at Simtel20 (and I assume at other locations) does
not even recognize that there is a 2000H offset in the CCP under
MicroSoft CP/M.  BYE had been trying to read from and write to
the area 2000H lower than the true modem port.  I'll revise B5AS-1
shortly.  It appears that it was never tested; there's no way it
could work as distributed.  Second, the Super Serial Card does
strange things with carrier detect, and BYE requires that the cable
be rewired.  The explanation as to how to do this in the insert is
very ambiguous.

   So the problem has been in the insert (as I suspected, but from
there I had been clueless), and not in BYE.  I now have a working
copy of BYE for the II+/SSC/MicroSoft CP/M that runs more or less
fine at 300/1200 (and I assume 2400; just need someone to call in
and test it), the only problem being that upon exit to CP/M the
SSC resets itself to its default baud rate (but this is easily
solved and explained in the insert).

   Thanks for your help (Keith and Irv) -- anyone who wants assistance
in setting up BYE for this configuration, drop me a note.

Keith,
	It would be *really* useful if this directory listing gave
the full filespec of the files, e.g. PD:<CPM.DIRUTL>NSWEEP.LBR
That way, we can use grep-like utilities to search for a file name
and get its location -- now I have to use a text editor to find the
directory of any particular file.  The, just to 1+ even more, if the
list contained the date of the file in sort order (1986-06-24), we
could find "recent" files with a sort program.

Sub:  KAY256.LBR

File 1632, KAY256.LBR, Library 18 of the CP/M RoundTable, contains
details on adding 256k of RAM to the Kaypro IV computer (pre 1984
model) by installing 256k chips in place of the 64k chips.  It
applies equally to Kaypro II's that contain a IV motherboard.  The
design can be used with any 8 bit computer that uses 64k dynamic
RAM.

This library contains detailed instructions, the circuit schematic
diagram, and benchmark results (gives an idea of benefits likely on
disk intensive activities).

No software is included here but if you wish to construct this for
a Kaypro, the author has written a BIOS that supports the RAM as a
ramdisk under ZCPR3 and offers it for the asking.

The library has been downloaded from The DataCOM Super Systems(tm)
(see JUN86.MQG for information how to access this system), which in
turn came from a caller in London England who only calls once or
twice a month.

Steve Sanders advises that he does not as yet have the altered BIOS
code mentioned in the DOC file.  It will be available on his BBS as
soon as he gets it.  He did however get the address of the author.
It is:

Subject: FATCAT24 buffered multi-disk catalog program available

Now available from SIMTEL20:

Filename			Type	 Bytes	 CRC

Directory PD:<CPM.CATLOG>
FATCAT24.LBR.1			BINARY	157824  05D4H

FATCAT is a multi-featured disk cataloging utility for Z80 CP/M
systems, designed with the user's convenience foremost in mind.
Features rapid-fire insertion of diskettes.  The filenames are simply
appended sequentially to a temporary file.  When you are done, the
computer does the tedious work of sorting, inserting, deleting,
without making you share its tedium (a good time to go wat supper or
watch TV while MAST.CAT is being updated).  Includes full LBR file
support, a function to generate a cross-reference listing (like XCAT).

Bugs fixed in version 2.4:

-- The last filename is now correctly displayed in X-ref format listings.

-- The program should find overlays at all phases of operation (just
keep them on the program drive and you will be all right).

-- If the library cataloguing function is turned off then no spurious
number of library files will be reported.

-- FATCAT should now work properly with CP/M Plus.

-- No mysterious number gets displayed during a catalog cycle.

The following enhancements are provided in version 2.4:

-- A Print to File option has been added to the OUTCAT module.
This should please those who find my output formats in previous
versions too "authoritarian."  Also the "Disk Information" or <I>
option has been updated to work with the same keyboard controls as the
OUTCAT module.

-- More informative error messages now appear on Disk Full and 
other such conditions.

-- Under normal conditions, the temporary .TCX file will not be 
erased until the other files have been closed during the update phase.
This should make it easier to recover from disk full crashes and such.

Subject:   RAM disk question

I am considering building a RAM disk for my S-100 system.
Because my Z-80 CPU board does not have the IEEE 24-bit
addressing or bank switching, I will have to the access the
RAM disk through I/O ports (the way CompuPro's M-Drive/H does).

However, I don't understand how the memory is addressed on the
RAM disk.  If the board is accessed only through I/O ports,
how is the on-board memory address generated?  A regular S-100
address decode circuit won't work, because the RAM disk is
not in the system memory space.  Does the address have
to be calculated by the CP/M BIOS and then written into latches
on the board, or is the calculation done on board given "track"
and "sector" information?

Any help you can give me would be greatly appreciated.

To: Info-CPM@AMSAA.ARPA
Message-ID: <12215655974.8.CENT.MBECK@OZ.AI.MIT.EDU>

     This CPU board has a >50 nsec. glitch on the phase 1 (pin 25)
line due to a race condition between IC-8D (a 7474) and IC-12A (a
74LS04) being caught by IC-5D (a 74LS02) and then amplified by IC-3A
(a 74LS367).

     The fix is two-fold: (1) Replace IC-8D with a 74LS74.  This will
narrow the glitch such that a... (2) small capacitor installed between
IC12 pin 2 and ground.  I found, after some experimenting, that 150 pF
worked find - glitch now gone.

     Two CPU boards here had this problem.  The extra pulse out was
causing timing problems on another board in the frame which was using
phase 1 clock to generate internal timing.

     I would appreciate hearing from other XOR S-100 owners - there
are some mistakes in the schematics I received from U.S. Micro Sales
and a couple of problems in the CP/M BIOS they shipped with early
systems.

Subject: Christensen Protocol file transfers through a TAC
In-reply-to: Msg of 20 Jun 1986  11:23-MDT from LIN at mit-xx.ARPA

For TOPS-20 users there will soon be an entirely new version of the
TOPS-20 MODEM program called TMODEM available, currently in beta test.
TMODEM, like MODEM before it, properly handles network binary mode
negotiations of behalf of the TAC user for the duration of the actual
file transfer.  MODEM required the "N" suboption; TMODEM automatically
determines if you are a TAC user.

TMODEM implements the YMODEM 1K data packet option.  It is well-known
that the regular 128-byte data packets require a TAC input buffer size
of at least 134 bytes instead of the default 64 bytes for uploads at
any speed above 300 bps.  Given that the total input buffer space in a
TAC is 4K, it is not likely that you can get a TAC port reconfigured
so that you will be able to upload using the K option.  Downloads are
not a problem using either packet size or at any speed.

Users of other operating systems are at the mercy of the implementors
of their telnet device drivers.  In some cases, you may give the
explicit TAC commands @B O S<cr> and @B I S<cr>, in that order, prior
to the file transfer command.  In other cases, that buys you nothing
as the telnet device driver ignores the network binary mode request
and arbitrarily masks off high bits anyway.

Note also that network binary mode is incompatible with Flow control
mode.  It is possible to give those TAC commands and not be guaranteed
that they took effect as there is no status returned to you by the
TAC.  To increase your chances of success, turn off Flow control in
both directions with the TAC commands @F O E<cr> and @F I E<cr> BEFORE
the other TAC commands shown above.

One final note: once you've manually turned on network binary mode,
your commands must be terminated by a Linefeed instead of a CR, and
you may see lines of output skewed across the screen as implicit CRs
are no longer inserted by your operating system.  You will not be able
to get out of network binary mode or enter any other TAC command
unless your operating system provides a mechanism to do the
negotiations on your behalf or until you logout and the connection is
closed.

There is a program that came with the MSDOS when you bought a Xerox 16/8 PC
that allowed you to read Xerox 820 (-II, 16/8 PC) format 5 1/4" disks, and
the standard 8" SSSD disks.  I have used it a couple of times to move stuff
from CP/m to MSDOS, but I have not found it really satisfactory because it
tends to loose some of the data in the move.

What I have found works the best is to transfer the programs from computer
to computer by connecting the modem ports of both computers together (with a
null modem in between) and then using modem programs on both machines that
support the same protocol, sending the files accross.  This can be done very
quickly if you set the baud of the modem port up to atleast 4800.  I try to
run at 19.2k, but have found that 9600 works the best.  Ussually you can
find Public Domain modem programs that support xmodem protocol for both CP/m
machines and IBM PCs.

/* ---------- "Misusing Z80 registers" ---------- */

If you assume that a program should save the ix, iy, af', etc registers
before calling the operating system, then Turbo Pascal falls into the
catagory of misusing registers.  It expects the index registers to be saved
by the operating system, which, unfortunately, my VT180 does not do.  This
causes the find and replace operations in the turbo editor to fail.

				Eric Hildum
/* End of text from uiucdcsb:net.micro.cpm */

It's fairly common for BIOSes (BIOTA?) to clobber the index registers.  My
Altos 5-15 does it, too, which explains why the Turbo editor doesn't work on
it, either.  Philippe, are you listening?

I have Dave Rand's "NEWARC.LBR" which is excellent.  It has spliced all of
the seperat functions into independant programs 2-3k in length.  Although
I don't use ARC on my RCP/M, I find it great for backup purposes and it
comes in handy to be able o easily access certain IBM-type files thru CP/M.
There is also a "DEARC.LBR" floating around.  Your best bet woiuld be to
check your local RCP/M and I'm sure that Keith's Royal Oak has the
utilities online.

There are 2 or 3 S-100 cards based on the 64180, and I think as many as
10 OEMs.  Echelon mentions them from time to time in the newsletters.
Also, Zilog is now second source for the 64180.  All that I have heard of
are running the Z System.

I'd like to find a public domain Z80 assembler to use with Apple CP/M 2.23 on
a MicroSoft SoftCard.  It'd be nice if it were a macro-assembler, even better 
if it accepts a macro library, but I can live without macros.  Relocatable
code generation is not important. 

I can't FTP from either the ARPAnet or the usenet; the best form for me would
be a softcopy source listing, which I can Kermit to my Apple and then
assemble.

Subject: UNARC12 CP/M unARChive of MSDOS ARC files

Now available from SIMTEL20:

Filename			Type	 Bytes	 CRC

Directory PD:<CPM.CPMLIB>
UNARC12.LBR.1			BINARY	104448  AC35H

UNARC is CP/M 2.x+ utility which lists, types and extracts files in
MS-DOS archive libraries (*.ARC files).  NOW SUPPORTS A VERSION FOR
NON-Z80 SYSTEMS.   Version 1.2 also provides wheel byte support for
simplified use by RCPM sysops.   Library includes assembly language
source.  For minimum download, extract just UNARC.DOC and UNARC.COM
(Z80) or UNARCA.COM (8080/8085).  UNARC12.LBR is 102k, 816 records.

More information on new version:

* Provides an alternate version for use on non-Z80 systems.  Now all CP/M 
  users can access archive files!  (See note below.)
* Provides wheel byte support for easier use by RCPM sysops (see note).
* Aligns file types in directory listing for improved readability.
* Permits processing of "self-unpacking" archives (e.g. MS-DOS ARC512.COM).
* Attempts to recover from "invalid archive file format" errors in a manner
  compatible with MS-DOS ARC 5.12.

If you are unable to access SIMTEL20 because of network restrictions
this file is also available on my RCP/M Royal Oak (MI) which may be
accessed at 300 bps (Bell 103a), 1200 bps (Bell 212a), or 2400 bps
(V.22 bis).  The telephone number is (313) 759-6569.  It is also
available from the CP/M RoundTable on General Electric Information
Services' GEnie.

the Z16 memory boards (2 of them). I believe either the ZPU board is
the problem or the VDB board is burned out, as I can't get it to
completely boot itself, although it does show activity. I need to know
where Xitan, inc. is today, hopefully to contact them for information
and/or parts. I have tracked them as far as Mass. in 1979, but no
further, and I need documentation on the system I have. If anyone can

I have modified the Turbo Pascal versions of uuencode/uudecode that were
posted to net.sources a while ago to work under CP/M (required bypassing
the brain-damaged way that CP/M Turbo handles files of byte).  These
would make a nice handy way to exchange binaries of CP/M software on the
net, since uuencoded stuff is usually only about 1.5x the size of binaries,
rather than >2x as is hex format.  If there is interest, I could post to 
net.micro.cpm or some other appropriate newsgroup, or email to interested
parties.
 
This brings to mind another thought--What would the reaction of net.micro.cpm
readers be to the idea of someone posting uuencoded binaries of interesting
new PD software to the newsgroup as they appear?  The recent lists of new
software available on SIMTEL for March and April were impressively large,
but I like many have no ARPA access and a budget that isn't happy with multi-
hour long-distance calls or CompuServe sessions.  
  
I suspect that uuencoded versions of squeezed libraries probably wouldn't
take up much more space than the unsqueezed libraries themselves, on average,
and so would not really overload the net.
 
What does anyone think of this?  Are there any ARPA types out there who
would be able/willing to post new .lbrs as they appear?
 
Note that I am NOT advocating large-volume random mailing of software among
individuals, which probably would tend to overload things.  I'm basically
suggesting that the CP/M community start doing something that the Mac and
IBMPC users have been doing for some time, and in greater quantity.

	The following summarizes the size of the ZSYS Archive on SIMTEL20.
The byte counts reflect the sizes of squeezed files (for the most part),
so the actual, unsqueezed, files are larger than reported.

ReSent-Date: Sat 28 Jun 1986 22:32-MDT

Recently whilst trying to select 2400 baud modems for our dial-in lines 
on campus, I ran into an interesting problem. Some 2400 bps modems 
wouldn't connect to others at 2400 bps, but would connect by falling 
back to 1200.

After casting about with a certain degree of futility trying to find 
someone who could tell me WHY this was, I finally got ahold of an 
engineer at Anchor Automation who explained it to me. (By the way, I'm 
completely impressed with these people and their willingness to solve 
problems!)

[Brief flame to other modem companies: Yes, damnit, I know your modems
talk to each other. My problem is that I've got one hundred and seven
dial-in lines (at last count) and I have no control over what the
people out there are going to dial in with. Telling me to have them
all buy your modem to solve the problem is not the answer.]

So here's how I understand it (imperfect at best, but I couldn't find 
this information written anywhere, so here goes):

When you call a 1200/2400 bps modem, it answers in either of two ways. 
If it is a CCITT-V.22bis compliant modem, it answers with 3.3 seconds 
of 2100Hz tone, then 75 mS of silence, and then a burst of training 
signals to get the other modem to adjust to the line.

If the answering modem receives training signals in response, it 
assumes that it will be talking 2400 bps using 16-QAM and you have a 
2400 bps connection. If instead of the training signals, it receives 4-
PSK from the originating modem in response to its answering tones, it 
assumes that it will be a 1200 bps connection and switches off the 
training and (in the USA) uses 4-PSK (Bell 212 standard). [European 
modems use CCITT-V.22 (not V.22bis) for 1200 bps. Some modems claim to 
handle this as well as 212 for 1200 bps, but I've not been testing 
that!]

Here's the rub: some of the 1200/2400 modems don't answer using the 
CCITT V.22bis handshake. They instead answer with a different handshake 
(the engineer referred to it as the Bell 2400 bps handshake): After 
going off-hook, the "Bell handshake" answering modem sends 2125Hz 
(which is pretty close to the CCITT 2100Hz tone) and waits for the 
originating modem to respond either with 1200bps 4-PSK or with QAM 
training signals. It then switches to the appropriate mode, and either 
sends some training signals for 2400, or 4-PSK for 1200.

Some modems can handle both kinds of handshakes. I have, for example, 
no problem calling a Courier with a Courier, anything with a Racal-
Vadic or a MultiTech, etc. But my Courier can't call my Case-Rixon; an 
Anchor didn't connect to the Courier, etc. No, I don't have a chart of 
what talks to what, for reasons that I'll explain:

The point here is that I'm not interested really in what talks to what 
on a brand-name basis. I want instead to find some brands that "do the 
right thing" for both handshakes, and recommend those. So far I've 
found a couple (Racal-Vadic and Multitech come to mind) and I'll choose 
among those and others based on other factors, such as interface, 
reliability, mounting, etc. for the list of ones I recommend. (And then 
the purchasing people and telephone people get into the act, so who 
knows what we'll buy - or when....)

But the other manufacturers need to get on the stick and get it right. 
It seems to me that stating that a modem is CCITT-V.22bis compliant 
also means that it does the CCITT handshake, and yet I can call several 
of the modems out there and just by listening (no 75mS interruption, 
guys!) tell that they're using the "bell handshake".

And the ones that I've tested that answer with the "bell handshake" 
don't seem to accept the CCITT handshake when you dial out. Moral: It 
may be 2400 bps but they're not all compatable. C'mon, guys!

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Modem manufacturers!  Heed my words!  Since there is a published
international standard and one other non-compliant "standard", you need
to accept both!  And you should probably default to the international
standard when you answer.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Listening test: I call the modem and listen. After it goes off hook, I 
hear in my telephone either

 1) a steady high-pitched tone, then a very brief interruption,
 then another slightly-different-pitch tone, then it
 disconnects.
-or-
 2) a steady high-pitched tone that lasts until it disconnects.

I surmise that #1 is the CCITT handshake. I just tried this with a 
Case-Rixon 1224 and a USR Courier. The Case-Rixon did #1, the Courier 
did #2. If I call both on a conference call, I hear what could be a 
25Hz beat note between them during the first tone on answer.

So, I'm not disparaging anybody's modems.  But I wish there was more 
standardisation so that I don't have to buy one of each to test them 
before we make some big mistake....

Earlier I posted an item describing a problem where my Kaypro-II video 
would cease horizontal scanning.  I "played" a bit with the components 
and connectors when this conditioned occurred and found that there is a 
4 conductor connector towards the front left of the machine that had 
the solder on the pin on the board which connects to the blue wire 
neatly "eaten away."  Resoldering the pin seemed to fix the problem. 
Luckily, the pin was accessible through one of the vent holes on the 
bottom of the Kaypro so I didn't have to disassemble the unit.

Hope this helps someone else.

The Bores Eye Institute needs your help. If you know of anyone who has 
access to a Cromenco computer with a modem we can use that person's 
assistance. We have some important patient data files on 8" Cromenco 
disks that need conversion to 5 1/4" and MS(PC)-DOS format. This is 
research data and is very important. Our budget cannot afford the heavy 
cost of direct conversion. We'd like to transfer them by phone if 
possible. We can pay expenses and a gratuity for the service.
 
Please help.

Subject: FATCAT catalog program documentation bug

Relayed from my RCP/M:

--cut here--FATCAT2X.BUG--cut here--
There is a nasty bug (most likely just a typo.) in the 'APPENDIX.A'
documentation file in FATCAT23.LBR and FATCAT24.LBR (and perhaps earlier
versions).  Near the end of APPENDIX A there is a detailed procedure
given to use DDT the patch in your computer specific codes for your
cursor control arrow keys.  The instructions are quite correct and 
understandable for one not familiar with DDT, EXCEPT the last instruction
is "SAVE 42 FATCAT.NEW".  This instruction should be "SAVE 88 FATCAT.NEW".
       
If you follow the original instruction you will get an error message
such as 'SELECT ERROR ON Y' when you try to run FATCAT.  

Of course, if you use PATCH18A (suggested by Gary Inman) or EDFILE
(my preference) to patch memory locations 0153 and 0164 through 0167
of FATCAT.COM to patch the arrow keys you will have no problems.

Note to Steve Cohen -- sorry about this bug notice, but I think
we've all had them.....

Yes, XMODEM is what you want.  It does not require the BYE program.
It's available from SIMTEL20 as:

Filename			Type	 Bytes	 CRC

Directory PD:<CPM.RCPM>
XMDM124.LBR.1			BINARY	113792  4437H

If you are unable to access SIMTEL20 because of network restrictions
it's also available on my RCP/M Royal Oak (MI) which may be accessed
at 300 bps (Bell 103a), 1200 bps (Bell 212a), or 2400 bps (V.22 bis).
The telephone number is (313) 759-6569.  It can also be found on the
CP/M RoundTable on General Electric Information Services' GEnie.

You'll need a hardware overlay, which you'll find in XMDM-OVL.LBR.
Chose the appropriate one for your computer's I/O port arrangement.

Subject: Taking a stand

The latest version of KMD has just been released.  It has no source
code, only a patch file for customization.

Many SysOps have expressed their dislike for the situation on BYE5 and
KMD (really XMODEM renamed).  The following file, -BYE5KMD.NOT, is now
posted on my RCP/M:

BYE5xx and KMDxx will no longer be supported on this system.
They were public domain programs and are now copyrighted by
Irv Hoff and Wayne Masters.  We join many other RCP/M SysOps
in protesting the "appropriation" of public domain programs
by people who then modify them and copyright them.  This is
not in the true spirit of RCP/M public domain programming.
For those who don't know, BYE was originally written by Dave
Jaffe.  KMD is a renamed XMODEM, which was originally written
by me, based on Ward Christensen's MODEM2 program.

You are encouraged to download and forward the replacements
for BYE5xx and KMDxx:

  NUBYE100.LBR - public domain version of BYE5
  NUKMD100.LBR - public domain version of KMD
  NU-CLOCK.LBR - clock inserts for NUBYE
  NUBY-SUP.LBR - supplimental library for NUBYE
  NUBY-INS.LBR - port and modem inserts for NUBYE

There are many added features to them.  MOST importantly,
they are now back in the public domain for all of us to
contribute to - and feel good about it.

Maybe you should have scoped it out. The Commodore Mouse is in some 
ways a real mouse and in some ways not, of course depending upon what 
you consider a "real" mouse. The mouse workings are very cheap in most 
everyone's mouse; they simply consist of two circular wheels 
alternately transparent and opaque, which cause two phototransistors to 
pluse in proportion to the velocity at which the mouse moves. The 
expensive part comes in the mouse interface, which generally transmits 
some good and meaningful velocity information in a form that the 
computer can accept. Up to this point, a trackball does something very 
similar, and the two are really interchangable.

Now the interface on the CBM mouse is a custom microprocessor that sits 
out in the mouse and watches the motion of the vanes. It will pulse a 
four bit digital TTL level signal which corresponds to the 4 bits of 
joystick information all Commodore consumer type computers accept. Thus 
it is compatible with joystick software, at least to a degree. The main 
problem is that the pulsed digital lines can easily get saturated when 
moving the mouse; this seems to happen even at reasonably slow speeds. 
Also, even a program written specifically to read the mouse is going to 
look sloppy as compared to the same thing with a standard quadrature 
mouse, the digital pulsing takes lots of processor time to scan 
correctly, and it still doesn't convey the same resolution of 
information available in the mouse that you're thinking of.

Most arcade-style trackballs take an even simpler route, and don't 
pulse the digital output at all; they look just like digital joysticks. 
That's what you get for buying a Commodore/Atari/ETC COMPATIBLE 
trackball. There are also trackballs that generate a quadrature output 
compatible with the mouse output on an Amiga or MAC machine.

The bottom line is that the current Commodore Mouse, as intended for 
C64 and C128 style computers, is a compromise between full mouse 
functionality and compatibility with software that's out there.

I have and use a MAKE facility with my CP/M 3.0 system. I had "ported" 
one of the P.D. IBM PC makes. I'll post the source and binary to 
net.sources if there is much interest (and if I remember to upload it

Most telephone line transients result from lightning strikes causing 
current to be dissipated through the sheath of the telephone cable to 
ground. This INCLUDES cable which is buried underground. A voltage is 
induced in the individual telephone cable conductors due to the HUGE 
currents and magnetic fields which accompany a lightning strike (to 
give you an idea how large the currents are, lightning strike currents 
are measure in KILOamperes, with a typical lightning strike being 100 
kA).

Except in extreme cases, the lightning voltage itself therefore never 
hits the individual conductors (which would cause destruction of 
dielectric), but its propagated through capacitance and inductance 
between the cable sheath and its pairs. The resulting transients are 
"longitudinal" in nature, being from each wire of a pair to ground; 
these transients are NOT generally from conductor-to-conductor.

What does the above mean in practical terms? For one, placing a MOV 
(Metal Oxide Varistor) just across tip and ring will do almost zip for 
providing transient protection. You need TWO MOV's, one from tip to 
ground, and one from ring to ground. And I mean GROUND, like a #12 AWG 
wire to a water pipe - NOT the third wire of an AC power outlet. Because 
the MOV is not going to be very effective unless a low impedance path 
to earth ground exists.

So, it is possible to build your own telephone line surge protector 
using two MOV's as indicated above. However, it is not quite that 
simple since the MOV's have to be carefully selected. First, the MOV 
should exhibit a leakage current flow at 50 volts DC of LESS THAN 500 
microamperes, which is equivalent to a resistance of at LEAST 100,000 
ohms. At 130 volts DC, the leakage current should still be less than 
1,000 microamperes. Exceeding these values can CAUSE TROUBLE with your 
telephone line, such as: (1) false ring tripping; (2) hum and noise due 
to longitudinal unbalance; and (3) trouble indications at the telephone 
company central office due to automatic line insulation testing 
equipment thinking your line is in trouble. The effective breakdown 
potential of the MOV should be around 180 volts DC to preclude any 
false trouble indications.

In my opinion, any product which claims to be a telephone line surge 
protector and consists of a single MOV across tip and ring is ALMOST 
WORTHLESS. You need to go between the conductors and ground, for the 
reasons mentioned above.

I don't want to get off on a tangent here, but there is something which 
is better than a a MOV: a gaseous discharge tube, especially what is 
called a "three element" gaseous discharge tube. These devices exhibit 
an infinite impedance in the "off" state, and conduct much faster than 
a MOV. In telephone parlence, these are referred to as "rare gas 
protectors". However, the cost of such a component is several times the 
cost of a MOV.

I've used UNIFORM PC to transfer files from Superbrain QD to IBM-PC and
vice-versa.  It works, but one problem.  The disks had to be initially
formatted
on the IBM-PC to the Superbrain format.  Then these disks used on the
Superbrain.  The UNIFORM documentation said it had to do with a GAP
spacing
problem with the NEC FDC chip used in the Superbrain.  Disks formatted
on
the Superbrain are not read reliably by the IBM-PC.  Within this
constraint,
files are transferred fine.

I don't know if any other packages have this limitation....

The C128 runs CP/M 3.0, which uses both banks of memory when normally
operating.  The extra memory allows a larger TPA, and generally results in
a faster machine.  The RAM Expansion module (1700,1750) are configured as
RAMDisks in CP/M, giving you up to 512K of RAM Disk, as drive M:  WordStar
will load in about a second off of drive M:, other things are similarly 
very fast.
