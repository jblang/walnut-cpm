Hello

Has anybody ever tried adding a Commodore C128 5.25inch disc drive to
an Amstrad PCW8256 (or similar) running CP/M. I would also like any
information at all about the Commodore drive, what type of 'commands'
it understands and how to read/write data to it!

Thanks for any information

Hi,

I am writing a program to unpack .LBR archives on UNIX (perhaps pack later).
I have the structure of the archive (which is fairly simple).

What I am looking for is a description of the compression algorithms
used when squeezing or crunching files (i.e. generating *.?Z? or *.?Q?)

Any pointers or help?
I'll make the program available if there is any interest!

thanks in advance

Subject: Heath/Zenith Z-100 & 5 different OSes
Message-ID: <12563193352.15.GUBBINS@TOPS20.RADC.AF.MIL>

The Z-100 is a very powerful machine cabable of running five different
operating systems (at least, several persons are porting MIMIX to it now
as well).   It is an 8085/8088 S-100 Bus system.   Depending on the year
made it ran the 8088 at 5 or 8MHz, with most current users running at 10MHz.
The 8085 side, which runs at 5MHz, has mostly been ignored by most users.
The Zenith supported OSes for the 8085 are CP/M-85 (V3?), and even HDOS.
The Zenith supported OSes for the 8088 are CP/M-86, MS-DOS V1-3 (Version
1 of MS-DOS was called Z-DOS), CCP/M, MP/M (multiuser or multitasking, 
neither caught on).   CP/M+ was available from a 3rd party.

In spite of the ignorance of one poster, the Zenith Z-100 ran True MS-DOS,
not the kludged version maimed to operate in the PC and clones.   The 
Z-100 design did not put limits on MS-DOS, so if you want 768K of MS-DOS
RAM, and with a S-100 RAM expansion card - 1MByte of RAM, MS-DOS was more
than happy to use all of it.   The Z-100, as was the Tandy 2000, and TI
Professional - Superior systems in all respects to the PClones that ran
MS-DOS : Better hardware, CPU speed, better graphics, easier programming.
But, because of the superior features, they are not PC hardware compatible.

A program written for MS-DOS (or CP/M for that matter) will operate on
any system with MS-DOS (or CP/M).   Programs that violate this (Like most
PClone programs, all programs that use graphics, programs that directly
use hardware/ports/etc will usually blow up on a system that it was not 
written to run on.

The Z-100 can, in fact, run a lot of PClone programs directly (Norton,
ARC, PKARC, MS languages, Borland languages, etc), even more with a 
compatibility software patch (INT 10 handler).   A lot of popular software
has Z-100 versions that make use of the Z-100s features (Lotus 123, Dbase,
MS-MULTIPLAN, Turbo Pascal, Wordstar, Autocad, Word Perfect, etc.).

There is an active net group on the Z-100 at INFO-HZ100[-REQUEST]@
TOPS20.RADC.AF.MIL

I can send you boot and diagnostics disks for the Z-100 if you are
desparate and I can try to dig up some spare Z-100, MS-DOS, CP/M-85 manuals.

Cheers,
Gern

I believe that Dave Rand's NSWP (NewSWEEP) program for the IBM PC does this.
If you can't find a copy on a local board, send me e-mail and I'll arrange to

        Earlier this week I acquired a Vector Graphics S100
computer with a dedicated NEC 7000 (700Q?) printer and a 5 Mb
hard drive.  I have a few questions about it.

        1. Is there a Vector user's group?
        2. Was an 8088/86 board ever made?
        3. Can the printer be adapted to work with
           an RS-232 or Centronics port?
        4. Can the hard-sectored floppy drive be tricked into reading
           any of my Osborne or Kaypro diskettes?

        Thanks to everyone who helped with my Otrona questions last

Yeah, I realized this after thinking about it for awhile.  I'm sure
Z80MU passes alotta info to MSDOS directly.  We already run it on our
386i by running it through a DOS process; I was hoping for a method to
get it directly on UNIX to help performance.

I have almost completed disassembling the ROM from my OSBORNE-I,

Can anyone confirm the significance of these ports?

     1      1       READ/WRITE= DATA

Also, does anyone know what the STATUS/CONTROL flag values might be?

As far as I can tell, STATUS Bit 0 Is Controller Ready for read/write,
and Bit 1 is some sort of Error State.

HELP!

Anyone out there familiar with any of the California Computer Systems

I have a 4MHz Z80 CPU, 64K dRAM, and 5 1/4" / 8" floppy controller
board, and, of course, no docs regarding jumpers, etc. I have gotten
about as far as I can get with the ROM disassembly without schematics,
and I can't make the box bootable. At one time or another, I have seen
each of these pieces functioning in a WORKING SYSTEM, so I assume I am
simply missing the combined significance of some of the jumpers on
these boards...

Does anyone have any docs on these boards or know where they might be
found?

Well, I got 'em. When I programmed ARC 2.0 few months ago, I had to find
out the algorithms used in the V1.0 pascal sources and the ARCSQ C sources.
As a result, I guess that I know them a little bit now. You can contact me

   Yet another request to the Boston Computer Society for a boot disk for an
orphan machine.  This time it's a CompuCorp 775.  For any help it might be,
here is some information about the machine.  It is a Series 700 machine,
serial number 753251.  The company was apparently in Los Angeles.  It has a
DIP switch on the back set for "HALF PG CRT ATRB".  It has one port labeled
"Omeganet" and a printer port labeled 22H.

   The computer will not boot from any disk (of the very few) that the new
owner received from the old owner with the machine.  By pressing control-C
or control-D, he can get the display to show:

        Reset

        >

If the command "DIR" is entered at the prompt, the display shows:

   If anyone knows anything about this machine or can supply a boot disk for
it, I would appreciate it if they would contact me (SAGE @ LL.LL.MIT.EDU).

Subject: File transfers through console
Message-ID: <1990Feb3.214127.21671@eagle.lerc.nasa.gov>

I was recently given a S-100 computer system running CP/M 2.2 and
would very much like to put some useful software on it.  I have a
PC-XT clone and have downloaded a lot of CP/M software to it for
transfer to my S-100.  Unfortunately, my S-100 currently has only one
working serial port (the console) and no 5 1/4" floppies.

I can download ascii files to my S-100 by using my XT as the console
and doing a "pip filename.ext=con:", escaping back to my XT, and using
the "Transmit" (raw ascii upload) command in kermit, but only with
files smaller than 8k because pip writes its buffer to disk after 8k.
Even my hard disk can't write fast enough to keep it from losing
characters.  I can break ascii files into 8k chunks using an editor on
my XT and put them back together using "pip" on my S-100, but this is
no way to transfer lots of files.  I really need a file transfer
program that will work through the console.  That is, I want to be
able to use my XT as the console of my S-100, tell my S-100 to receive
a file, escape back to my XT, and send it.  Does anybody know of a
file transfer program that will do this?

A few years ago, my Kaypro and all that went with it was caught in a
flood.  I've managed to salvage most of it, including a JRT Pascal
version 3.0 compiler.  The documentation, however, was another story.

If anyone has the original loose-leaf docs and wouldn't mind sharing,
I'd gladly pay any repro & mailing costs.

General question for discussion: I seem to recall being invited to
Chapter 11 proceedings shortly after receiving my copy of JRT Pascal.
As I recall, JRT had a unique distribution policy that allowed free
copies to be made of his work, including JRT Pascal, which only cost
$39.  Is JRT still in business?  If so, does anyone have an address?

Thanks in advance.

The .DOC file for Z80MU310 (the last version, as far as I know) mentions
that they started out by passing calls to DOS directly, but as they went
along, there were subtle incompatibilities between CP/M semantics and
DOS semantics tha they had to program around.

The heart of Z80MU is an assembly-language Z80 simulator that depends on
a unique mapping of Z-80 registers to 80x86 registers. You could
probably port that module to your 386, bu forget it for other
processors...

Don't forget *.?Y? !  This is the LZH compression algorithm which was ported
to CP/M last September.  The file -SOURCE.NOT contained in the CRLZH11.LBR
library (the cruncher/uncruncher files) contains the sentence:

     "Most of the 'interesting' stuff is in the LZH encoding and decoding
      algorithms, anyway, which are released in .REL (and .SLR) format
      ONLY at this time."

I wouldn't think the algorithm would be much (if at all) different from the
LZH program available for some time for MS-DOS.  Don't know if you can get
specs for it, either.  The author of the CRLZH routines for CP/M is
R. Warren and he gives the number of The Elephant's Graveyard data line
(619) 270-3148 where he can be reached.  That might be another good place to
ask questions about all the compression routines (I've never them myself,
though).

Subject: JRT Pascal doc wanted

Chuck Fuller asked:

>> If anyone has the original loose-leaf docs and wouldn't mind sharing,
>> I'd gladly pay any repro & mailing costs.

   I have not looked in a long time, but I am pretty sure that I have
a copy of the JRT Pascal manual sitting in my archives in the basement.
I know that I gave away one copy, but I think I had two.  You can also
get them in file form, probably from SIMTEL20.

   One other comment I would make is that I got very badly burned from
bugs in JRT on a very important project.  Turbo Pascal is far superior
in my opinion, and it is available again at $60, complete with an
improved looseleaf manual.  If you are not all that serious about
Pascal and are working on a tight budget, then JRT might be the way to
go.  Otherwise, I would recommend switching to Turbo.

>> General question for discussion: I seem to recall being invited to
>> Chapter 11 proceedings shortly after receiving my copy of JRT Pascal.

   JRT really did go out of business.  Tyson tried again under the name
Mystic Valley Pascal (I believe), but as far as I knew he never really
delivered on that product.  There were early versions, but they never
worked well and never provided the features he claimed in his ads.  Once
I learned that JRT was behind Mystic, I stayed away from it.

   When the first ads appeared for Turbo Pascal at an absurdly low price,
I was quite sceptical but decided to take a chance.  I never regretted that
decision, and have been very happy with Borland products (for the most part)
ever since.  Turbo Pascal was a top quality product at rock bottom price,
and that is probably why Borland is what it is today (and, conversely, why
JRT is what it is today).

   I believe that you will find both the code and the manuals for JRT in
the archives on SIMTEL20.  Years ago you would have found it on CP/M remote
systems, but I doubt that any of us would waste the disk space on it today.

Subject: Any Morrow (s100) owners out there?
Message-ID: <1529@shell.shell.com>

I've just bought a Morrow S-100 Z80 computer with a 16M hard drive
and 5.25" floppy. This beast has a "Wunderbuss" that has a real
time clock, and several serial channels out. There are some 
things that I'm looking for:

Since I can read hard/soft sector disks, I think there should be
or must have been a utility to read NorthStar disks on this machine.
(I think it's an MD-1, but I'm not sure). Any body have something
like this?

Has anyone installed DateStamper for this machine?

I also have a 256K RAM card that was intended for use with 
Micronix - a Z80 UNIX. I'd like to check out CP/M 3.0. Has
anyone ported to this machine? Alternatively, does anyone have
a RAMDISK driver for the expansion memory?

Finally, has anyone upped the hard drive to a workable size?
(Like 40 Megs or so)?

Thanks.

Subject: Footnotes...

Hi!

I am desperately looking for a text formatter or editor, whatever, that
is capable of producing footnotes.  I know there was a discussion on
this quite a while ago, but I kind of missed it.

By footnotes, I mean the kind that comes on the bottom of the page,
and NOT endnotes, which come at the end of the document or to another
file.  This distinction is VERY important for us social science types,
and I actually need both for my thesis.  I hate having to transfer
everything to PC's and reformatting the documents.

Now, a promise:  TETRIS (a trademark of some sort, but not sure whose
or if it is officially registered) for CP/M (Z) - 80 is ready for
release!  I just need to add a routine that  will make it completely
compatible with QTERM patches (by David Goodenough) and make sure that
there is no bugs.  If interested, drop me a line, along with your
terminal types (I just need to know clear screan sequence and cursor
positioning.  Televideo TVI 910-920 types need not worry.  ANSI type
terminals might take a while).  I will send you a copy (unless this is
against net rules - I think owners of semi-extinct devices need this
much privilege, tho'.).

Thanx!

They've recently started advertising again in various PC rags, although
which ones escape me at the moment. When I saw the ad I had this vague
feeling of Deja Vu. I pulled out an antique MicroSystems, and sure enough
it's the SAME AD!! They only changed a few words (inserted C in place
of PL/M, for instance).

Can anyone point me to a disk editor which works under MP/M?  I have
several which work fine under CP/M but fail on MP/M.  I suspect the problem
is that the actual disk buffers are in a different memory segment.

What I need is to be able to patch the contents of the directory sectors
on the hard disk.

Please email or post (or phone, etc.), your choice.  If I can't find
a disk editor, it appears the only choice will be to restore a backup

Subject: binary/source postings
Message-ID: <1282@anasaz.UUCP>

A couple of years ago, I posted to this group the source to a utility
I wrote.  I was beaten up rather roughly for having done so.  My
recollection is that this group was gatewayed onto the Internet
somehow and that someone there had a restriction on source and/or
binaries floating by.  They threatened (or were required, I forget) to
break the gateway rather than allow programs to transit their systems.

Is this still so?  Are binaries or source postings discouraged (or
worse, punished)?  Is this group constrained to be discussions of old
systems and mutual help in supporting them?

Please let me know.  I've got a couple of other (semi)nifty programs I
have written that I'm willing to place in the public domain.  They are
CP/M specific, so I can see no reason to clutter up some other source
newsgroup with them, but I'd post them here.  If that is not a good
idea (for political or other reasons beyond our control), I'd like to
start the formal voting procedure to establish a group for source
and/or binaries postings that are for CP/M and MP/M systems.

We, like the MS-DOS people, have the luxury of binary compatability
across most of our systems.  I'll bet there is a ton of useful goodies
we have all written that we should be able to share.  How 'bout it?
I'll show you mine, if you'll show me yours....

Chad, binary/source postings are inappropriate for any discussion
group, but especially for those gatewayed to mailing lists on the
Internet side.

The comp.os.cpm newsgroup is gatewayed to the Info-Cpm mailing list.
Many mailing list subscribers have disk quotas and some are charged
for disk storage.

There is an excellent public domain archive at SIMTEL20 which is
accessable by all readers of this newsgroup.  The problem is that for
the past two years there has only been ONE reader who has sent a
program contribution to the archives.  I can't do it all myself.

If you have public domain CP/M programs you want to share with others,
please send a message to me asking for upload instructions.

Hi yer all,


I have a project at University to build a scrabble machine. We have been
placed under various restrictions and so we eventually decided to base
the machine round the Z80. Thus for development we are hoping to use CPM
(although no-one knows much about it. I used it at school briefly!). 
Now for this, we need development tools and since our construction budget is
only 300 (pounds) I would be grateful if anyone could recommend good 
development tools, where to get them and how much they cost. 

I would also like to know of any FTP servers containing CP/M stuff. I am
aware of simtel but are there any others?

Please mail me back personally.

Thanx

On my Kaypro 4 (1984 vintage) I have a long header (connecter) that is much
like the floppy drive header (for a ribbon cable), but right above it.  Does
anyone have any idea what this is for?  Thanks.

Yes, I use QTERM by David Goodenough for my VT100 emulation.  It also
includes xmodem and KERMIT for file transfers.  I'll try to dig his
address out for you.

Ok, here is his address from me.  I don't know what it would be from

I'm looking for an assembler for CP/M 2.2 that uses Zilog's Z80

I would prefer something that generates a .HEX file instead of
some other object code.  If it generates some other object code,
I would need the appropriate link loader too.  Lastly, being a
hobbiest, I would like something that is either public domain
or inexpensive.

Any information can either be posted or e-mailed to me at

I guess, in my imprecise way, that was what I was asking...Is this

I'm sure it is very easy to get some things off SIMTEL20 if you are an
Internet participant and can use FTP.  I'm not.  I have tried to use the
gateway server at North Dakota(?) on three or four occasions, following
the proceedures posted and never gotten anything back (not even a "F.O."
message).  I gave it up as unworkable, due to whatever reason (broken
mailers, bad paths, terminal stupidity on my part).

Anyway, having to pull indexes (if you ever figure out how), examine the
one line descriptions to try to guess if you might want the <whatever>,
then pulling <whatever> to examine it in its fullness just isn't quite
the same as reading the news, scanning the posted source as it sails by
your face and typing "s" to rn when you see something you like/want/need
(like I can do in all the other sources newsgroups).

[An aside to Keith--let's make e-mail contact.  Maybe you can teach me
how to work the gateway.]

So, I'll renew my query.  Are source and/or binary postings a no no in
this group (beginning to sound like it)?  If so, I'll start the formal
discussion and voting procedure to establish a group exclusively for
program postings.  This group can serve as the discussion group for the
postings in addition to its current charter and Keith will have another
place to glom programs for his archive.  If the formal vote fails for
lack of interest, I'll pipe down.

I downloaded EXPRESS v1.0 from Simtel20 a couple of years ago.  This
is the "demo" version of EXPRESS.  TCI's address is listed in the
documentation as 17733 205th Ave. NE, Woodinville, WA 98072.  I wrote
to them to find out if EXPRESS v2.0 was still available, but my
postcard was returned by the post office with no forwarding address.

As it stands, EXPRESS v1.0 is a decent editor and it's free.  I was
able to configure it to make it resemble Emacs.  I was impressed
enough to want to buy v2.0.  If anyone knows where I can buy a copy of
v2.0, please let me know.

I ran into the "Synchronization error" message recently, too.

According to the book "Inside CP/M" by David E. Cortesi, MOVCPM has a kind
of copy protection built into it.  When it starts up, it does some
checking to see whether the copy of CP/M you're trying to generate with
MOVCPM matches the copy of CP/M you're currently running.  If not, it
displays the message "Synchronization error" and quits.  (I'm not sure
what it actually tries to match.  I think it does some kind of checksum.)

As a result, you can't run MOVCPM to generate a new copy of your CP/M
while running someone else's copy of CP/M.

I wanted to do exactly that for a legitimate reason.  My CP/M disk won't boot
because I replaced my broken 8" DSDD drive with a different manufacturer's
that had different seek characteristics, so I needed to generate a newly
configured version of CP/M to handle the new drive.  Of course, to do that,
I have to already be booted up on the new drive and running with SOMETHING,
so to get me started, a net person graciously sent me a bootable CP/M disk
that allows me to boot and read 8" SSSD diskettes on my new drive.  But I
can't use it to generate a properly configured version of MY OWN, PAID-FOR,
LICENSED COPY of CP/M because of that $*!!#@@! "copy protection" in MOVCPM!
Grrr!

If anyone has or can invent a workaround for the "Synchro error" copy
protection, I'd appreciate being informed so I can get my CP/M reconfigured
and booting happily again on my new drive.  Apparently the copy protection
is smart enough that you can't simply step over it using DEBUG.

Ok, as much as I dislike postings that say "I think this is it" instead
of "I know this is it"; I figured all this out a long time ago, and here
is what I remember:

The copy protection consists of checking the serial numbers of the CCP
and/or the current running CP/M and the BDOS image contained in the
MOVCPM program.  You CAN use "debug" (you meant DDT or SID, right?) to
make the serial numbers match.

The serial number in the CCP must match the one in the BDOS also, or
your CP/M won't boot.  It will move the instruction pair DI, HALT to the
beginning of the warm start code and jump to it.

The serial number is the first 6 bytes in the BDOS (that is why your
BDOS address is always something like E406 instead of E400).  It is also
contained in the CCP at about 0328H offset (if I remember correctly).

In the MOVCPM code is a relocatable image of your CP/M, and a table of
the offsets to the bytes that will have to be relocated to make a
runnable image where you want it.  The image is assembled to run at (???
-- for a 20K?? memory) and when you specify a different size memory the
new high-order nybble of the addresses are plugged where indicated by
the offsets.  This is very much like what Digital Research wound up
calling "Page Relocatable" (PRL) code in MP/M and CP/M 3.x systems.  If
you have documentation to either of them it could be helpful.

Anyway, a little dissassembly and single-stepping of MOVCPM with DDT
will show you where the "syncronization error" message is issued.  Use
DDT to make all the serial numbers match up (preferably to yours) and
you should be OK.

Actually I did the same thing a few years ago.  Keith then gave the secrets
for usenet access to simtel.

I had deposited quite a few pieces of S/W to the Simtel CP/M archive, but
at one point the programs I mailed Keith were bouncing, and I could no
longer get them deposited.

However, since then, I've been IBM pc-klone'd, and married.  So, I'm not
so interested in CP/M anymore, and I've less time to generate software.

I still have my CP/M system however (albeit with only 256K of it's former
1-Meg left -- the PC has the DRAM chips now), and can transfer files to
my PC.

I could still rummage around some weekend and find a pile of
never-distributed programs (some pretty neat and useful, and some like my
Unix compatible 16-bit uncompress were neat, but not useful) that I
generated, but I'm not sure if my mail connection to Keith has been
"fixed" -- and I have no convenient way to distribute them otherwise.

Nor, am I entirely sure I remember which were deposited and which
weren't. :-)

Alas....

P.S. - It takes no time at all to go from knocking your head on the 64K limit
       to knocking your head on the ~640K "limit".  Sigh.

Chad,

Keith is exactly right in his description of the way things run.  He
has also done yeoman work over several years to post summaries of
the Simtel20 CPM listings to this newsgroup for those of us who
are interested in current submissions.  Additionally, Kieth maintains 
a private BBS where he also has most things posted -- I'll let
him explain how that works, only mention it here because
that's a way to get the software if Simtel20 won't work
for you.  

If you are hanging so far off the internet that you can't FTP,
then your solution is not to corrupt the system but to fix your
connection.

I'm not an Internet participant either, but I have the facilities
to get those files from SIMTEL20.  I have a couple of shell script
files that I use here, and at one point, I posted them for those
who wanted them.  I'll post it again, plus I'll mail you a copy.

Keith:  You might want to keep a copy of this just in case...


#-------- BEGIN -----------------

That's for the North Dakota ListServer.  Here's the other one I
use.

OK, that ought to help.  As far as getting listings of files, you
might want to look at the fastmail line, and if you have one of
those helpfiles that Keith posted, that will show you syntax of the
/PDDIR command.  I'm trying to work on a shell script to do the job
for me, but I've got to learn a few more things about the Bourne
shell.

Enjoy!

It's for the SASI interface for the Kaypro 10's. The 10's used the same
motherboard.  There should be numerous empty spots on you motherboard
near the SASI connector -- those are for the logic to implement SASI.

It is possible to add these chips (soldering iron time) and then add
a hard drive, but you'll still need a Western Digital WD-1001-HDO or
WD-1001-005 controller to plug onto the SASI port.  Oh yeah, you'll
also need something called the "small circuit board", which plugs
between the SASI port and the WD board.  There is a company that 
advertises in Micro-Cornucopia that sells kits to add the SASI port,
the small circuit board, and even the WD controller.  This would
probably cost in the neighborhood of $225.  I can't remember the
name of the company, but their the same people who sell the KayPlus
ROM and they also sell QP/M from MicroCode Consulting.  

A cheaper way to add a hard drive would be to get one from Advanced
Engineering Concepts.  They even have a special version of the
Advent TurboROM that supports their disk controller (allows larger
drives and you can boot off the hard drive).

     It's the connector for the host adapter board.  This board is a simple
little gadget that has nothing more than an LS138 and a couple of resistors
on it, plus two connectors.  One goes to the motherboard connector, the
other goes to the W{_estern Digital HD controller.

     Before you get all excited, you must also have the 81-302 BIOS ROM in
you 4-84 before you can add the HD.  You also have to have the controller.

     The host adapter is available here in San Diego for $15 from a company
called ERAC.  You can find their address/phone # in Nuts and Volts.

Chad, please don't encourage people to post binaries or I'll have
to request that the Usenet<->Internet gateway be turned off for
comp.os.cpm<->Info-Cpm.

I am the Info-Cpm mailing list maintainer and I am the one who gets
all the complaints from Internet users when their disk qoutas are
exceeded or they have to pay extra fees for large files they don't
want to receive.  This does not work like Usenet where the news goes
into the spool directory and is not counted against anyone's quota.

What makes a "discussion group"?  The Usenet guidelines say any
newsgroup should be treated as a discussion group unless it has
"binaries" or "sources" as a part of its group name.  The same
guidelines state that it's a no-no to post binaries or sources to
groups other than those so designated.

We have a tremendous resource in the SIMTEL20 archives.  Rather than
trying to start a binary newsgroup, I hope you will try to find out
how to use the file server and help other non-Internet users to do the
same.

All that conector is is a parallel port ( no, it doesn't go through the
PIO ).  Actually, it's more or less just an extension of the Z80.

     Kaypro made two motherboards that support the hard drive interface.
These were the 81-180 board ( the Kaypro-10 board ), and the 81-185
board ( the 2/84-4/84-2X-Robie board ).  The 81-185 board has several
different part numbers, depending on which machin it was installed in,
whether or not it had the real-time clock installed, the modem installed,
etc.  The 81-185 board is also where the dreaded Universal ROM made it's
appearance.  Not to worry, the same board can also run the nornal 81-302
ROM.

     From part # 1484-F, Kaypro Technical Manual, September 1985:

Model Name	CP/M version	Mainboard	ROM revision

2/84		2.2g		81-294		81-292A
4/84		2.2g		81-184/85	81-292A
4/84+88		2.2g		81-184/85	81-292A
2X		2.2g		81-294		81-292A
		2.2h
4X		2.2g		81-297		81-326E
		2.2h
Robie		2.2g		81-296		81-478A
		2.2h
10		2.2g		81-180		81-302C
		2.2h
2X/modem/RTC	2.2u1		81-580		81-478A
10/modem/RTC	2.2u1		81-582		81-478A
New 2		2.2u1		81-294		81-478A
1		2.2u1		81-294		81-478A

     The table is actually somewhat inaccurate.  The K10 will run ANY
version of Kaypro CP/M ( except for u1 ), as long as you MOVCPM a 60k
system.

     The 81-478A ROM is the dreaded Universal ROM.

     The 81-184/185/294/295/296/580/582 motherboards are all the SAME
motherboard, and they all support the HD.  The best of these to have is
the 81-184/185, because it also includes the RTC and the modem.  This
motherboard is also known as the Universal Motherboard.

     This is the board that is/was in my K4/84, which is now a K10/84.
No soldering required.  Just cables.  You also need the 81-302 ROM,
and the host board, and a WD1002-HD0 ( NOT the 1001 ).  If you do have
a WD1001, you have to re-assemble the ROM.

     Any more questions?  With Kaypro just up the coast from me, it's
easy to get SOME questions answered.  Unfortunately, they have NO ONE
from the old days left ( that we could find ).

This is not intended as copy protection; it's intended to prevent MOVCPM
from building a garbage CP/M image.

MOVCPM uses a bitmap to determine which bytes to relocate when moving
the CP/M image. This includes the BIOS area as well as the BDOS and CCP.
The original intent was that you'd MOVCPM 54 (or whatever...it's been a
looo-o-o---oong time :-), then SYSGEN the resulting image, and then
boot. Each licensed CP/M distributor had utilities that built the MOVCPM
program from his customized image. For those of us who had to install
our own BIOSes, you had to MOVCPM, then load the BIOS on top of that,
then SYSGEN and boot.

The "Synchronization error" message is produced when the resulting
image, because of a difference between the systems, would have the wrong
bytes relocated, and therefore would be garbaged.

Nobody had even *thought* of copy protection when MOVCPM was
developed...

This is in response to David Goodenough's complaint that the SIMTEL20
archives are not accessable from UUCP sites.

David, the problem is that you are using the WRONG address for the
server.  If you are not on BITNET do NOT use the NDSUVM1 address.

LISTSERV@VM1.NODAK.EDU is the correct address for uucp, CSNet, and
Internet users who cannot FTP.  It's reachable from ANY uucp site that
is also on the Internet.

Examples:  xait!vm1.nodak.edu!listserv
          uunet!vm1.nodak.edu!listserv
           ames!vm1.nodak.edu!listserv

         gatech!vm1.nodak.edu!listserv
            att!vm1.nodak.edu!listserv

If you are not sure of the correct path to use, send email to me and
I'll tell you what your best path is.

If no one tells us there is a problem how are we supposed to know?
In this case, you had the wrong information.

This is somewhat the case. Although my true identity is dg@lakart.UUCP,
I get this via the Internet mailing list INFO-CPM. Even though I would
love to see binaries and source posted here, I have to agree with the
Internet people that limits need to be placed: lakart.UUCP is now a CP/M
machine, and I don't have infinite space on my spool drive (D:) which
is where my mail hangs out.

On the other side of the coin, I would agree that a mechanism for posting
source and binaries would be useful (I'd kill for the opportunity to post
QTERM V4.2g - it's now available.....), but I'd suggest that a (possibly
moderated) newsgroup comp.os.cpm.programs would be needed. I purposely
didn't say comp.os.cpm.sources or comp.os.cpm.binaries, since I believe
that the most benefit would come from a newsgroup devoted to both. Your
mission (should you chose to accept it) is to run the discussion, and the
vote, and see if comp.os.cpm.programs can get created.

I would, however, add the following: Keith Petersen (in a reply to the above
posting by Chad Larson) says:

WRONG!!!!! - it is only by a miracle of UUCP <--> Internet and
Internet <--> Bitnet gatewaying that I can get stuff from SIMTEL20.
Keith, PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE remember that many .UUCP sites _CAN'T_ FTP,
and thus are cut off from SIMTEL20. I'm able to access the BITNET
server at NDSUVM1, but even that's flakey at best: about 20 to 30% of
requests I send wind up in the bit bucket somewhere.

The day I'm able to hook lakart.UUCP (as it is now - pallio.UUCP
originally) to the Intenet, and issue a FTP request will probably go
down in history along with the day Eniac was first powered up: there
is only so much a 4MHz Z80A can do :-)

Subject: MOVCPM's "copy protection"
Message-ID: <9739@spool.cs.wisc.edu>

Good news/Bad news:

Thank you to David Goodenough for showing me how to work around the
"synchronization error" message.  The good news is that his tip allowed
me to run MOVCPM; the bad news is that it didn't do any good, since
the resulting CP/M image hangs.  A previous posting to this newsgroup said
that the serial-number comparison isn't really copy protection, it's
to make sure you get a valid resulting image.  Apparently that's correct.

The upshot is that I have to have my copy of MICAH CP/M running in order
to reconfigure it so I can get it running.  (That's a tough one!)

FYI, I WAS using a program called DEBUG...it's Cromemco's version of DDT.
(Since I didn't have a reliable CP/M to boot with, I had to boot with
Cromemco CDOS to do my fiddling with my CP/M boot disk, see.  CDOS isn't
completely CP/M compatible; it can read CP/M 8" disks, but lots of CP/M
programs crash under CDOS, which is why I bought MICAH CP/M in the first
place.)

If anyone still cares, here's the workaround that David sent me:

What about comp.sources.misc?  I don't think that CPM will be able to really
support a .binaries or .sources group (unless I an very mistaken) from
the traffic I have seen on this group.  the comp.*.misc groups might be
able to handle the occasional post for CPM, and it will be easier all around.
Someone might want to mail to the moderator (if there is one) of
comp.sources.misc and see if CPM falls under his bailiwick.

Yes, the Kaypro DSDD format is as you described.  I'm not absolutely sure
about the interleave, but, here is some other info that you will need
to create the disk parameter block & header:

	PARAMETER		Hex	Decimal
	Sectors/trk		28	40
	Blk shift factor	04	 4
	Alloc Block Mask	0F	15
	Extent Mask		01	 1
	Disk Size Max	      00C2     194
	Dir Max -1	      007F     127
	Alloc Mask 0		C0     192
	Alloc Mask 1		00	 0
	Dir Check size	      0020      32
	Sys Trks Offset	      0002	 2

Hope this helps.

How is it that this format has 10 sectors per track, while IBM PCs
have only 9 (and the old ones could only get 8 in)?

I recently got a 5.25" floppy controller for my CP/M computer
(which normally uses 8" SSSD), but it can only read 8 and 9 sectors per
track.  Does anyone know a resonably popular CP/M format that I could adopt,
and thus interchange my 5" disks with somebody?

I remain, etc.,

Ive been running an RCP/M for a few months now, and would like to get

but being such a long list, its hard to spot!

Anyways, the name is Minas Tirith, at (201)989-5334. 1200 and 2400 baud,
24hours a day, MNP-5 supported (if you have it).

running on a Xerox 820-II, with 32megs of online storage. NZ-COM, Z80DOS24
and QBBS (Ill soon be changing to DRBS, as a test beta site)

Interests are: Xerox and Kaypro, ZCPR3x- (NZCOM), Z80DOS, CP/M, and
just about anything thats of technical interest.

Try it out! See if you like it!

Thanx! (excuse my cross-posting to comp.os.cpm, but what better place

Rumor has it that MOVCPM compares the serial number of the CP/M that 
you're trying to move with the serial number of the CP/M that you're
running.

The serial number is stored in two places in CP/M: the first is just
before the BDOS, and the other is near the command line buffer in the
CCP. I'm not certain which one MOVCPM is checking. You should be able
to zap the serial number in MOVCPM's image using DDT, although I've
not tried it.

Message-ID: <6737@ucdavis.ucdavis.edu>

Hi all,

   I've just started reading comp.os.cpm and I saw that SIMTEL20 was a source
of binaries/sources.  I was hoping someone could give me the exact address of
the place so I can ftp from it ( if that's possible ).  If not, could someone
explain how to make contact in ANY way?

   As a side note, I have a good old Commodore 128 ( which has a cp/m mode ),
and I was wondering if anyone knew if this stuff would run on it.  It's got a
Z80 processor (only 2Mhz) running Version 3.x.  I doubt many others have this
setup, but I thought it couldn't hurt to ask.  :-)

                                        Thanks in advance,

                                        Bryan.

Try talking to Emerald Microware [ (503)641-8088 ]. They make a hard disk
adapter that fits under the Z80; you lift your Z80 out, plug it into this
board, and then plug the board where your Z80 goes. It talks to a Western
Digital 1002-05, which they also sell (WD doesn't even admit this thing
ever existed anymore; it seems that if it doesn't plug into a PC they're
not interested). They sell software to drive the thing.

They advertise in Micro Cornucopia if you want to look up an ad.

Message-ID: <2564@sactoh0.UUCP>

I just got an Ampro Little Board Tuesday from a friend for $50.
This is just the board and software because I have the necessary
hardware, like a floppy disk and a power supply.  The FD and PS I
got in the form of a 68000 box that someone just gave to me.  Now
the real quetion; With that 68k box, not only did I get a FD and a
power supply, I also got a 10 megabyte MiniScribe hard disk with a
Western Digital WD1002-SHD host adapter.  Is there a way to hook
this bugger up easily with my Ampro, and is software to drive it
hard to come by?

Thanks in advance.

I on the usenet side am pleasantly accustomed to picking up my source right
here without calling on servers.  Any attempts to talk to Simtel20 have failed
miserably, if Simtel20 can be accessed by those of use without Internet or
Bitnet access please explain how in V-E-R-Y simple language.  The obscure
referemces to a gateway (snort@foo.bar.EDU) with equally obscure instructions
to write help in the subject lines don't really help much.  Hey, I live in
a place where black bears are often seen it town and timber wolves are 
accessable within 40 km - we are cutoff from the leading edge.

Meanwhile how about comp.source.misc or alt.source or we could start mailing 
floppies to each other - I don't mind that either.  As for binaries, I am
an old Unix v6 man, I like source.  This organizatioan will not accept
a binaries newgroup anyway.  Do you suppose that CP/M is current enough to
be noticed by the virus development community?  :)

it got to the stdio.h file.  At that point, the disk says "BDOS error on

stdio.h.

So, does anyone out there have a copy of Eco-C stdio.h that they would be

KayPLUS ROM actually supports slightly more hard disk space than
TurboROM; both support two drives up to the limit of the WD100x

This is possible since a track on disk has lots of stuff around it for
synchronization, etc.  The actual number of bytes per track is fixed and
dependent upon the method and disk size (FM/MFM, SD/DD).

Kaypro "shortchanged" the synchronization header and intermediate headers so
that an extra sector could be squeezed into it.  Nine is possible even
using the manufacturers recommended track format;  IBM used eight originally
because it simplified the BIOS logical to physical sector xlation.

This is actually only part of the story.

There are two types of skew: hardware and software.

Only single-density disks (with a couple stupid exceptions) ever used a
software skew.  Kaypro, Xerox, and the like use hardware skew for double
density.

What Mark is pointing it is that the software does not see any skew since the
disk has been formatted with the skew on it (saves xlation time and memory).

You might try the archives at SIMTEL20.  I have a shell script that
you can use to snag files from there, and as soon as I have the
chance, I'll mail you one.

If you omit the soft index in the standard format you get enough space
to just squeeze in an extra sector IF your drive is within about 0.5%
of being on speed.

DEC did this for the RX50 (^&*#@&$ piece of trash). Unfortunately, the
drive is speced at 1.5% speed variation, so you are not guaranteed that
you can format a disk on the damn thing. If you complain, the field
service guys just swap drives until you get one that can format...
Of course, DEC did this single-sided 80 track, so you can only get
400K on a disk.

The reason that IBM did not use 10 sectors/track is probably that they
decided that it was pushing the capacity of the media too much.  IBM
is a very conservative bunch, don't ya know?  The IBM hardware is
perfectly capable of reading/writing 10 sectors/track.  I know.  I have
a non-standard formatting program on my PC that DOES use 10 SPT.  

Most likely, your hardware is capable of handling 10 SPT.  You just need
an appropriate formatting program and new disk parameter tables in your
BIOS.  I have an old Xerox 820-1 that originally 8" only.  I added
a 5 1/4".  Later, I got a new double density controller from Emerald
Microware.  This allowed me to add more drives and accomodate different
disk formats as well.  My configuration ended up as follows:

	1	8" SSSD
	1	5 1/4" SSDD
	1	5 1/4" DSDD
	1	5 1/4" DSQD (80 trk double density - but not like IBM 1.2M)

These drives along with a program called UNIFORM allowed me to read/write
just about any format that exists, including IBM 360K disks!  

My standard format that I used most of the time was the Kaypro 5 1/4" DSDD
390K.  This is probably about as close to a "universal" CP/M format as
you will find, because the Kaypro machines were very popular in their day.
I believe that they were the top seller in the CP/M arena.

In summary, if your controller is capable of reading/writing double density,
then some new disk parameters in your BIOS should enable you to handle
the Kaypro format.  Check your controller chip. If its a Western Digital
17xx or 27xx, it should work (except for the 1771 which is SD only).  The
NEC 765 and others in that family are also capable (most PCs use one of these).

Hope this helps.

Subject: MOVCPM fix
Message-ID: <1542@crash.cts.com>

     Here is the ultimate solution to the MOVCPM problem.  Disable the serial
# checks entirely.  I'm surprised that no one has suggested this yet.

     I had to do this a long time ago, when I replaced DRI's BDOS with one
of the PD replacements, and needed to run MOVCPM to generate a bootable
floppy.

     Note that this information is specific to a particular copy of MOVCPM.
Your patch point is almost guaranteed to NOT be in the same place.  But, in
looking at over a dozen copies of MOVCPM from as many manufacturers, I found
that:

	1) The code around the patch point always looks the same ( that
	   portion is DRI's, not the vendor's )

	2) The patch point has always been within 80h bytes of the point
	    specified in this file.

     Also... I did NOT write this patch.  I found it on a local BBS, MANY
moons ago.  It's not my fault if you screw up your copy of MOVCPM.  Do
NOT do this on an original disk!

MOVCPM.FIX:


   I recenly tried to help a friend generate a new system
on my machine, using his copy of MOVCPM,and we were greeted
with, "SYNCHRONIZATION ERROR" followed by the machine quiting.
After talking to another friend, I was informed that the
problem was caused by a serial number mismatch between my
system and his copy of MOVCPM. My friend further stated that
there was "NO WAY" around this protection. After pondering the
problem a while I decided to start disassembling MOVCPM with
the help of the "L" command in DDT. What follows is the
result of my efforts.

Begining at 2C0 I found the following code:

-L2C0 
02C0	POP	D
02C1	LXI	D,1200
02C4	LHLD	037A
02C7	MVI	C,6
02C9	LDAX	D
02CA	CMP	M
02CB	JNZ	025A
02CE	INX	H
02CF	INX	D
02D0	DCR	C
02D1	JNZ	02C9

I then did the following substitutions:

-S2CB
02CB C2 00
02CC 5A 00
02CD 02 00
02CE 23 .


After the above changes do a SAVE 40 MOVCPMNU.COM and you have
a version of MOVCPM that will run on any machine.

   With the above changes under my belt I decided to do some
more poking around in MOVCPM.COM and came up with the following
addresses that might arouse your curosity.

	B5F,	1200,	D28

	Best of Luck,

			A HACKER

The HD68B45SP is a CRT comtroller and the D780C is NEC's
designation for a Z80.  However, I don't know what the HD64505SP2

This is only part of the story, the other half concerns the FD controller
chip. Kaypros use the WD 1793, whereas the PC uses the Intel 765. Basically,
the 765 is a piece of junk, in that it is far less fault tolerant than the
1793, hence the 1793 can operate reliably with a shorter intersector gap,
thus cramming more information onto a disk.

To cite another example, My Televideo uses a 1793 to get 18 * 256 bytes
on one track, whereas the 765 can get only (I think) 16 * 256, I'd have
to check the documentation.

To take this to it's logical conclusion, in some experiments with variable
sector sizes, I was able to get the equivalent of 11 * 512 byte sectors on
a disk, and do so reliably. My main problem was figuring the sector
interleave since I did this with 5 * 1K (like an Osborne), and an extra
512 byte sector - after the 5 * 1K are put on, there's about 640 or so bytes
left over, which is plenty of space to snuggle a 512 byte sector into. One
day I'll get it worked out, because the concept of 440K on a 5.25 DS DD
floppy is too attractive to pass up :-)

Back in '85, before I had CP/M, I wrote a disk-formatting program (in Z-80 
machine language) for my Xerox 820.  The 820 uses a WD1771, which I didn't 
attempt to understand in the absence of documents.  So I called a Western 
Digital office and they sent me a copy of their "Storage Management Products 
Handbook", which also has 40 pages of specifications and applications notes 
on the 1793.  I'll send you a copy of the 1793 stuff for $2.  

I guess this is sort of like revealing the end of a mystery story, so it might 
ruin your fun.  8-)

Subject: A CP/M version of Tetris (the game) is ready for release!!!

Hello!

Tetris release v. 2.0 just passed the David Goodenough test for QTerm
patch compatibility (D.G.T.F.Q.P.C.).  This means, yes, finally, that
it is ready for distribution, etc.

Tetris is a video game invented by a Russian person, made familiar to
us through the Nintendo and Arcade versions.  If you do not know the
details of the game, consult a nearest video game renting store or a
video game center, or a person whom you consider to be conducive to
video game playing.

I have created three different archives for the same program.
TE20ANSI.ARK is patched for ANSI type terminals.  TE20TVI.ARK is
patched for TVI type terminals (^Z for clrscr, ^[=rc +20h for cursor
movement).  TETRIS20.ARK is a bit bigger, and has examples of both
TVI and ANSI so that patching can be done a bit more easily.

Like I mentioned, Tetris uses the patches for QTerm v.4.2. (which is
not really compatible with some of the earlier patch versions).
Considering the level of stress and the nature of the crises I have
been going through, I think I will end up producing a few more games
by the time my Division III (=senior thesis) is over.  Also,
David is a rather productive programmer, so I suggest you keep
around a COMPLETE (not the ones that come in my ARK's) version of
QTerm patches around for your terminal type...     :-)

Anyways, if you want the spiel, drop me a line stating which one
of the three versions you'd like.

IF YOU WANT TO DISTRIBUTE TO OTHERS, please use TETRIS20.ARK for the
sake of completeness, and please let me know beforehand so that I can
update you whenever necessary.

Thnx!!!

	I need to find a BBS list for CPM machines.  Specifically, I need
a communications program, preferably Kermit, for an Osborne 1 running CP/M.
I have downloaded rcpm0290.lzt from simtel20, and it seems to be exactly
what I need, except that I don't know what was used to compress it.  I
assume that it is compressed since I expect a BBS list to be an ascii file,
and this is binary.  In any case, if someone could point me to an ascii
BBS list for CPM (Osborne 1) machines, a kermit executable for an Osborne 1,
or tell me how to uncompress rcpm0290.lzt on a UNIX or MS-DOS machine, I
would be very grateful.

Subject: Binary posting on discussion lists....

Hello...

This is in response to Richard Loken (did I spell it right?  If not,
thousand apologies...)'s question regarding binary source posting.

As far as I know, the way these discussion groups work is that when
one sends a message to the group's "base," the base cc's the message
to all of the members (hence the name "list").  Often, as is the
case with info-cpm (or comp.source.cpm, or something like that as
you call it), the groups bases are located in an internet site or
a uunet site (or whatever else have you), which makes it inconvenienet
to forward ALL of the messages through the gateways over into
other networks (over 10 per day, depending on the group), especially
BITNET.

Now, I would imagine that most source codes, UUencoded and what not,
would be far greater than 10 kilobytes.  Just imagin hundreds and
thousands of copies of these flooding across ALL of the nets possibly
imaginable.

Also, let's consider the fact that most of the gateway'ed messages
are "digested" into a bundle of more than one - I've seen one from
dist-ibmpc that was about 30 messages long - messages.  Since
the digests are organized alphabetically, the source is bound
to be stuck somewhere in the middle of the digest.  For some mailer
programs, you have to go through EVERY SINGLE PAGE of it until
you get to the next message.  No way skipping.

Now, let us consider some of us, like me, who are still struggling with
a 300-baud (or even 1200-baud) modem all the way through the pages-long
source code just to get to the next message, whose content one knows
only vaguely through the often uninformative subject lines.

Would this convince you of the impropriety of source posting?

Instead, you can just post a message asking if people want the source,
and if they reply, send the source.

Maybe, just maybe, this IS what you meant by  "source posting."

In that case, this message is misdirected.... I'm sorry.

I'm also sorry that this message was so long.  I imagine this
would be the last of this sort, but first on the digest (starts with "B").

Thanks.....

                    John
P.S.  at least I don't use lines-long signatures... :-)

Hi Everybody,

For more than a year ago someone posted an add, in this newsgroup, for
a TURBO like environment (integrated editor, debugger, fast ...) for C
and running under CP/M.  (or did I just dream this. It sounds
incredible ... :-) I have some slight memory of it being a new version
of BDS-C (!?)  (maybe from another dream!?)

Anyway, I would greatly appreciate any references for any C
environment and compiler, under CP/M, that even slightly resembles
what's given above.

Or putting it another way. Is there a (TURBO-, Lightspeed-,Flash-,...)
C for CP/M ?

I don't mean to be rude or anything, but WHY? Is there something wrong
with QUATRIS (by Steven B. Perkins)? I'm not much of a game player,
but for the few times I've played QUATRIS, it very closely resembled
what I had seen of the arcade version.

Wouldn't you diminish that stress if you were working on your thesis
like you should be, instead of writing those computer games?!  :-)

     WHich Ampro?  A LB/Z80, or LB/Z80+?  The first has no capability for
a hard drive without adding Ampro's host adapter ( goes under the Z80...
sells for $99 ).  The LB/Z80+ has the SCSI port installed already.

     You might be able to convince your parallel port to talk to the WD
controller, but it's FAR easier to just go SCSI.

similiar if not identical to the Ferguson Bigboard.  
 
Quite some time ago it developed a problem.  It used to use an old Tektronix
keyboard, and this keyboard burned out.  We are rather certain that the 
keyboard is what's gone, as we have had replaced all the chips in the keybd
interface, and the rest of the components look good.
 
I have another keyboard that I wisht to connect.  It too is a Tek keybd,
and the edge card connector is exactly the same pattern.  In the lower
left hand corner of the PCB is the following:

	KTC A65-01863-003
	PCB-002D

	and in smaller type right below this, the inscription:

	TEKTRONIX INC 119-0374-09
			  REV D

In addition, it has a numeric keypad on the right hand side of the board with
cursor controls on the top of the keys, numbers on the front and a click-lock
NUM LOCK key, also a click-lock TTY LOCK key at the lower left of the main
section of the keyboard.

What I need, in all sincerity, is help in locating tech data, direct advice, or
a comibination of both...as far as tech data, I need anything that would 
help me to make the keyboard and computer come together (schematic for the key
board, or schematic for keyboard input to the Bigboard, as the doc I got with
the old girl are woefully incomplete).  Alternatively, I would appreciate
any addresses...email or otherwise...that would connect me with anybody who 
had this info.  We have the tech expertise on tap...all we need is the 
intelligence.

Please help me get a magnificent old computer back on line!  We miss her!
 
 advaTHANKSnce!

Subject: Thanks for assistance
Message-ID: <9002200732.aa08319@CRDEC2.APGEA.ARMY.MIL>

Several weeks ago, I put a plea out on the network for assistance finding a 
replacement disk drive for my Intertec Compustar computer.  I received answers
from Clarence Wilkerson and Andy Marchant-Shapiro stating that the drives should
be direct substitutes (5 1/4) with PC drives.  I now have a fully operational 
Intertec with a full height drive in as drive A and a half-height drive working
as drive B.  The only problem was modifications to the drive mount bracket and
the faceplate on the computer to enable my putting the disks in and out of the 
half-height drive.  The drive address is set for disk 1 in the half-height, and
all functions seem to be operational.

Thanks to all for your assistance.

I think I have the one with just the Z80.  And what kind of drives
can be used with Ampro's host adapter (which I am willing to do
because I don't know where to find the SCSI version of the LB)?
The drive I presently have is a MiniScribe model 3012 and it came
with a Western Digital WD1002 board.  Any information would be
helpful.  Also, thanks for saying something about the LB+ whose
specifics I didn't know before.  I was wondering what differences
there were.

Message-ID: <1616@crash.cts.com>

     The SCSI host adapter from Ampro gives you a true SCSI bus port.
It supports devices 0-7, can operate in either initiator or target mode, etc.
The NCR 5380 SCSI chip is used.

     To this you need to connect a SCSI HD controller.  Personally, I
recommend Adaptec products.  I use an Adaptec 5500 controller ( which has
many, MANY more features than the BIOS supports ), but the 4000A will work
quite nicely.  The BIOS directly supports the following:

	Adaptec ACB400A ( although any Adaptec will work )
	Shugart 1610
	Xebec 1410/1410A

It also supports the following drives with embedded controllers:

	Xebec OWL

     These are what are mentioned in the documentation.  The main
differences between controllers are usually in the format command, and in the
device initialize command ( what Adaptec calles Mode Select ).  If you
need to, you can modify Ampro's format program to handle anything you want.

     If you want to boot from the HD, you need an auto-initialize controller.
The ones currently supported by the SCSI ROM are the Adaptec and Shugart
controllers, along with the OWL.  There is also a non-Ampro enhancement to the
ROM which supports the non-initialize controllers.

     The host adapter is Ampro P/N A74007-C.  They don't manufacture it
any more, so they're limited to stock on hand.  When I bought mine ( end of
'88 ) Rick Lehrbaum told me "we only have a few left."  Since then, I've heard
nothing.

     I've used this LB/Z80 for over two years ( I bought it used in '87 ).
The guy I bought it from assembled it from the kit.  He never had any problems,
either.

if you have the morrow cp/m for this sucker, you should be able to

Message-ID: <WANCHO.12568400290.BABYL@WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL>

      I'm curious about Simtel20...  Where is it, how did it get
    started, what type of system, os, etc???  Electronic addresses
    don't lend themselves to maps. (That's why my disclamier is what
    it is.)

Here is the short answer.  If there's enough interest, I'll post a
much longer version which explains the complete history.

SIMTEL20 is located at White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico, about
40 miles north of El Paso, Texas.  It was originally procured to do
Scientific and Engineering work with access to net resources for the
Hybrid Computer Facility in the Simulation and Teleprocessing Branch.
The SIMTEL20 name is a contraction of that branch name and the fact
that it is a DECSYSTEM-20 running the TOPS-20 operating system.

It was installed seven years ago, in February, 1983, and was finally
connected to the net in August 1983.  When the Macsyma Consortium was
dissolved in September 1983, SIMTEL20 inherited the CP/M collection we
started on the MIT-MC host in 1979.  To that has since been added
several large collections, including the canned SIG/M, CP/MUG, and
PC/Blue collections as well as our own MSDOS, Ada, Unix/C, and
Macintosh collections, plus the mail archives for 22 mailing lists.

The primary purpose of SIMTEL20 is to provide network mailbox service
to scattered users in DoD, Federal agencies, and their contractors for
an annual flat fee.  For those users, we provide a stop-gap service
until they obtain their own local network host.

Until about a year and a half ago, those fees were the primary source
of income which made SIMTEL20 self-sustaining, including the
maintenance of the collections.  Except for the funding of a disk
drive to hold the Unix/C collection from another Army agency, LSSA, in
1985, and the partial funding of the Ada collection maintenance in the
past by the STARS Project office, the collections are unfunded.  The
maintenance of the collections is operated under one of the charters
of the DARCOM Microcomputer Software Sharing System proposed in 1982
and initially funded by several DARCOM (now AMC, Army Materiel
Command) organizations.  We are seeking other sources of funding to
keep this operation alive.

Dear Netland,

  Info is still coming in on adding hard disks, some specific to

more than 5-10 people want it, it will be posted!!

  I'm curious about Simtel20...  Where is it, how did it get started,
what type of system, os, etc???  Electronic addresses don't lend

  Please, if any answers would endanger us and Simtel20 from evil
hackers I'm sure we all would rather operate in ignorance!!!!!!

  Maybe Keith Petersen would be so kind as to enlighten us newcomers!

I'd like to add a strong "second" here.  I purchased a 400A last year at
an unbelievably low price from a liquidator.  I'm at a loss to explain the
low price except that perhaps these things were discontinued?  Anyhow, it
came with almost no documentation, so I prepared myself for the documen-
tation "run-around".  Boy, was I ever wrong!!  When I called Adaptec in
Milpitas, they told me mail $5 to a special mail stop at Adaptec and include
the model number of the product I was seeking documentation for.  I got
a *very* complete manual back in less than a week.  It included a schematic
for a host adapter and source code fragments (Z80 asm) for a cbios.  I
was amazed!  We should cherish organizations that treat their customers
like this.  It appeared that *any* manual on an Adaptec product could be
had for $5.  That's saying a lot for this day and age!

hi there,

  i have an important question.  i hope that someone out there can help me!!!
  
  i am trying to replace some interrupt vectors in the interrupt table,
  using the  INT 21H  interrupt call.  i was trying to use int 21h with
  AH=35H and AL=09H  (trying to replace the keyboard function/response) and
  insert the address of my own routine by using INT 21H with AH=25H and 
  AL=09H.  the problem is that when i run it it pukes and locks up the system,
  all interrupts are disabeled.  this is not the result that i want!!  ;')
  i know that it is getting locked up within the interrupt itself and not in
  another part of my code. 

  any suggestion that anyone could offer i would greatly appreciate.  please
  remember though, i am trying to do this with the  INT 21H interrupt call.


						thanks in advance,

Message-ID: <D4D005A9729FA01CA0@uwplatt.edu>

I recently got QTERM 4.2g from Simtel-20.  It looks like a very good program.
However, the patch for the Commodore 128 in the QTPATCH.LBR file is for
QTERM 4.1e and they are not compatible.  I'm VERY new to CP/M and don't know
enough about assembly to modify the Kaypro patch that is included in the
QTERM42G.LBR file.  Is there anyone out there with a QTERM 4.2g patch for the
C128?  Perferably one with a descent keyboard map for arrow keys and the
keypad.  But if no one has one with a good keyboard map, I'll settle for one
that will just make the program work.  Thanks in advance.  You can mail me

If it has been stored that long, be *VERY* careful powering it up.  You
might consider covering it with a thick blanket or something, the caps
in the power supply have been known to explode when powered up for the
first time in a long time.  Not all of them, but some have.  It's more of
a mess and disappointment than a danger if you'll leave the lid on and
cover it with something.  The older power supply (upright caps, wired
on top) was the worst offender, but I'd be careful with either.

I have a home-built host adapter on my home-build Z280 system,
and I have used it to run a Memtec 20 Meg cassette tape drive with
a SCSI controller card.  It worked very well. (I now have the drive
hooked up to a PC).  The only thing is that these drives are streaming,
so they like to get data in long bursts.  I used a 32K buffer in
a port of unix "tar", and it was very handy for backing up hard disks.
I wish I had another drive, so I could swap tapes between the Z280 and
the PC.

Because I had already written a SCSI driver for the hard disk, it was easy
to make it generic, to perform a SCSI transaction for any device.  

I.e:   status = scsiop(busid, cptr, dptr, dlen);

Where busid is 1 to 7, cptr points to the command bytes,
dptr points to the data buffer, and dlen is size of the buffer.
The routine figures out how long the commnd is, and which way
the data is going.

SCSI stuff is fun.  (but ask me about my 9-track CP/M tape drive)

     There is software available from Ampro to do backups to a tape drive
interfaced over the SCSI bus.  I dunno how well it works; I haven't tried it
'cause I don't have a tape drive.

     If you want random access, I'd have to say no.  Streaming tape?  Almost
certainly.

Yes, Micro Cornicoupia is still in buisness, and one of the best programming
journals out there (like DDJ, Byte, and Creative COmputing used to be.)  They
occasionally (from about the 5 issues I have) do have a CPM column, but I
don't think it's on any kind of permenant basis.  They do carry ads from
places that sell/service Kaypros though.

Great Magazine ! They are still around. I believe they still offer PD

Perhaps if you posted your message to comp.sys.ibm instead of comp.os.cpm,
you would get a better response. Since Im still using CP/M these days,
I have no contact with the MS-DOS world, and prefer it that way. Maybe
some of the other people who subscribe to this newsgroup feel the same way.

	I just bought mine (Kaypro II '84 + modem port) for $40 (!), but then
	I don't think the guy knew what he had. Next weekend he had another
	one (Kaypro II, pre-84, no modem), this time he wanted $60, I turned
	him down. He said he had 3 of them and was trying to sell one at a time
	to get the most of them.

	I thought about buying it (spare parts, re-sale), but did not want to
	give in to the price hike.

	Could it also have to do (pricing) with availability and demand? It 
	seems many people don't know what they are and won't run the risk of
	being stuck with an anchor, and the people that know what they are
	are aware that parts and support are getting scarce...

	BTW, I think I need a couple of drives. Will any "single side" flopy
	drive do? (In other words, are this drives PC and Kaypro compatible or
	are they a special kind?).

  Curt, 

  I just arranged to purchase a Molecular 32 (CP/M) with 60 mg HD, tape backup, 4 terminals with enough internal boards for 12 users for $400.00.  I'm also buying, from the same fellow, an Altos with 40 mg HD and tape backup 4 user system for $100.00.  I think CP/M machines have hit rock bottom.  For simple word processing and modeming, they seem to be the best deal in town.

Several short questions:

A) Is ZCPR a public domain (or shareware) program?  
B) Is ZCPR worth bothering with on a non-hardisk system (i.e. Osborne exec)
C) Is Turbo Pascal still available for CPM? 
D) What is the bye program?

Thanks.

Does anyone know if Texas Instruments TMS 40L44 chips are interchangeable
with 4164s or 4264s? Thanks,
