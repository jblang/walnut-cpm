Herb,
	I think you're referring to the SPU-Z, which has a 6Mhz Z80B,
192kb, 2 serial ports, and can slave to the 86/87, 286, 68k, and 16032
boards.  It'll be supported by MP/M 816 (good for guys like us).

	Last I heard, though, was that it's still not quite available.
(...and I just got an 85/88...).

Macrotech International (the firma that sells a 1Meg S-100 memory board)
will be introducing a CPU board designed to be a plug-compatible
replacement for the Compupro 8085/88. It will sport a Z80B at 6MHz
and an 80286, also at 6MHz I believe. They had not planned to implement
the circuitry necessary to allow the use of 8 bit wide memory, but
discovered that MPM-816 has some quirks that makje this a necessity. It
is therefore back to the drawing board. My latest report is that
the mark two design is complete and pc board artwork will commence
momentarily. Macrotech expects to have a wirewrap prototype at Comdex;
I will have one of the first real production run of pc boards and will
reort at that time (time frame is 1-2 months from now). This board
should really be a spped demon, but it will not be cheap. Macrotech
seems to be committed to leading edge technology for high-powered
multiuser systems, such as G&G systems, Alpha Micro (a major
customer for their ram boards), etc., and price is secondary to
performance.

Subject: Updated MDM730 files

MDM730.ASM, .AQM, .HEX and .COM on SIMTEL20 have been updated to Irv's
"official release".  The new files have a .2 after the filetype and
the original .1 versions have been deleted.

A .DIF file has been provided for those who got the source code and
want to update without having to download again.  Here's the info on
it:

		M730730A.NOT - March 31, 1984
	      Provided by Keith Petersen, W8SDZ

M730730A.DIF is an SSED2 editor script provided for those who
downloaded the original MDM730.AQM which was superceeded by
an updated version from Irv Hoff released one day after the
original.  It allows users to update to the revised version
without having to download whole new file.

Use the following command to make MDM730A.ASM (a temporary
name only), the updated version.  It is not intended to revise
the version number at this time.

	SSED -U MDM730.AQM <M730730A.DIF >MDM730A.ASM

The above assumes you have the .AQM file.  If you have already
unsqueezed it use the following command instead:

	SSED MDM730.ASM <M730730A.DIF >MDM730A.ASM

The CRC of the resultant output file, after assuring EOF padding of
the last sector by running FILTX or FILTEX on MDM730A.ASM, is:

--> FILE:  MDM730A .ASM		CRC = B3 D3

Subject: Xerox 820 text downloading
To: info-cpm@BRL.ARPA

A friend has just bought a TRS-80 Model 100 portable computer and
wishes to be able to send text files from it to his Xerox 820.
Apparently the Model 100 will send one of its text files out its modem
line upon command as simply a steam of bytes with no protocols to
speak of other than a carriage return between lines.  I'm not sure if
it has any flow control.  Are there any CPM programs out there which
could be made to run on the 820 that would store the incoming stream
of text in a file?  I hate to re-invent the wheel for him, so if
anybody can offer some advice, I would appreciate it.  Thanks.

B.G. Micro, in Texas [(214) 271-5546] sells depopulated Xerox 820
boards for $30 (including documentation).  They will sell a ~25
page document package for $5.  However, they want a check for $5
mailed to them before they'll release just the documentation.  I
sweet-talked the lady I spoke with (Tammy) into sending me the
documentation first, with the promise that I send her the check
in return.

There's also an ad for the Xerox outlet store (selling the used
820 boards for $50) in "Computer Shopper" magazine.  They have lots
of other good stuff, like power supplies, etc.

Anybody have a good source of parallel encoded keyboards (I assume
that's what the 820 board needs)?

using CPM 1.4, I would appreciate it iff people
revising the marvelous public domain utilities could continue

the documentation what versionss are supported.
   For example, the old MODEM series wroked fine, but the new
MDM seriess does not and does not state so. The

ALLUSR needs to be disabled to get it to run.

Subject: CompuPro Service
Article-I.D.: ecsvax.2216

When I first bought Godbout products almost four years ago, the
company was highly responsive to my requests for help.  In several cases,
Godbout offered excellent technical help as well as the ability to
purchase replacement parts.  This support occurred in addition to providing
products which were rock solid.  Several recent events have convinced me
that the new CompuPro seems to have quite a different attitude.  I recently
tried to buy a replacement 8085 (6Mhz 8085AH-1) through either their
distributer or Godbout itself.  In both cases I was emphatically told that
the company would no longer supply parts for their products; if I wanted
something fixed, I would have to return it for repair at standard rates.
I understand that the particular chip is in very short supply and I would
have appreciated a response to that effect, but I really never even got a
chance to state what part I wanted.

Three weeks ago I bought a copy of CPM-86 from Priority I.  The manuals
stated that if the source code which was supplied was incompatible with
the ASM-86, I should return the package.  I got a return authorization
from Priority I and was told to mail the original disks to CompuPro.
Three weeks later I checked CompuPro to see why I had not received the
disks.  It turns out that Priority I gave CompuPro the billing address
for the University of North Carolina as the shipping address and CompuPro
ignored the address I had placed with the return disks.  As you might
expect neither CompuPro nor Priority I have acknowledged responsibility
for the mismailings and I have been unable to locate the disks after at
least 50 telephone calls to various areas on campus.  Worse than that,
neither CompuPro nor Priority I have even responded to my requests for

clearly as case where a company has not gotten better as it has grown.

This update comes from Sigi Kluger.  Here's his note:

SD has always had a very obscure bug which is now fixed. In addition,
SD-79A had a bug in the FENCE routine (a line read LDA ':' instead of
MVI A,':'). The bugs are now fixed. Two versions of the COM file are
provided, SD-80V.COM for vertical display, and SD-80H.COM for normal
horizontal display. Do not mistake the V and the H in the filename
for a version number modifier!

The bug in SD-79A (and all previous versions of SD) was noticed by
Gene Head who notified me and asked for a fix. The problem is that
when SD found the last extent of a file and the EX field was 00, the
S2 field was non-zero and the RC field was 80, SD dropped that
extent in favor of the next lower one. The reason is that the internal sort
routine sorted 12 characters (F1..F8, T1..T3 and EX) where it should
have not included EX in the sort. The problem is only noticeable with files
whose size is just larger than an even multiple of 512k (i.e. 520k, 1030k
and so on). Obviously, only large files were affected.

GOOD assembler (I'm tired of the DevPack, even with my disk kluges)
GOOD editor (better than Exedit; I need a *LOT* of buffer space, more

Subject:  SIMTEL20 ARCHIVES.

     Public Domain Software Lovers - At long last, the Great Archive Blurb is 
finished!  This updated version covers ALL of the archives on SIMTEL20, and
will (I hope) answer most of the questions that have been pouring in since the
announcement of the new PC-BLUE archive.

     I especially want to thank Gail Zacharias <GZ@MIT-MC> for a very thorough
job of proof-reading and error reporting.  The blurb is considerably improved
as a result of her efforts.

     Thanks are also due to Frank Wancho <WANCHO@SIMTEL20> for making the 
archives possible, and to Keith Petersen <W8SDZ@SIMTEL20> and Richard Conn
<RCONN@SIMTEL20> for maintaining them.  Without the efforts of these people,
I wouldn't have had to write this thing (hmmmmm).

     Finally, thanks to all of you who have been patiently waiting for this
information, and wishing I'd hurry up so that you could get at the goodies.

     This blurb is about thirteen-thousand characters long.  It's a lot to
absorb at one time if you don't already know most of it.  My advice is to print
it, and keep it on hand for reference.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                            THE SIMTEL20 ARCHIVES



OVERVIEW

     There is a collossal amount of free public domain CP/M software in
several archives on SIMTEL20, a PDP-20 running TOPS-20 at White Sands Missile
Range.  Files may be obtained using FTP (described in a following paragraph)
with user-name "anonymous".  For a password, use your host-name (or any string
of printing characters).  Throughout this message, FTP examples are given in a
GENERIC syntax.  You will have to consult either a local documentation file or
your friendly system wizard to learn the actual syntax used with your local
mainframe operating system.

     UNIX users can do "man ftp" for instructions.  ITS users can do 
":INFO FTP".  I will be happy to update this message to include pointers to
other sources of documentation if they are sent to INFO-CPM-REQUEST.

     To get directory listings, connect to SIMTEL20 via FTP and do this:

                get micro:<cpm>cpm.crclst 
                get micro:<cpmug>cpmug.crclst 
                get micro:<sigm>sigm.crclst 
		get micro:<unix>unix.crclst 
		get micro:<pc-blue>pc-blue.crclst 

The first will get you a directory of a cpm archive that was moved from MIT-MC.
This is the one to watch for the very latest CP/M offerings, as it is updated
frequently.  The second is the full catalog of the CP/M Users Group.  It (and
the third and fifth archives) will be updated as new disks are issued.  The 
third is the full catalog of the Special Interest Group for Microcomputers 
(SIG/M), a service of the Amateur Computer Group of New Jersey.  The fourth
contains UNIX-related software, not all of which is CP/M-specific.  That which
does apply specifically to CP/M is in the directory <UNIX.CPM>.  The CRCLST
file shows the contents of the full UNIX archive, which is growing rapidly.
The fifth archive contains software for the IBM-PC.

     There are many overlaps in the first three archives, but you will find the
latest versions in the <CPM> archive.  In general, the archived software is
very good, having been worked-over and refined by multiple users.  The comments
tend to be complete and imformative.



FILE TYPES

     Files in the <CPM> archive are stored in two formats, ASCII for DOC, HEX 
and ASM files, and ITS binary for COM and squeezed files.  Squeezed files have
been compressed using the programs available in directory <CPM.SQUSQ> to obtain
an approximate 35-percent size reduction.  These files can be identified by the
letter Q in the file-type field. For example, file MICRO:<CPM.MODEM903>DEFF.AQM
is a squeezed file.  It must be transferred as a binary file, and then un-
squeezed.  The unsqueezing can be done on the CP/M system using USQ-20.COM (or
whatever is the current version from directory <CPM.SQUSQ>), or there are
several host-based unsqueezers in the <CPM> archive (see for example, directory
<CPM.TOPS-20>).  File MICRO:<CPM>CPM.CRCLST shows the type of storage used for
each file in the <CPM> archive.

     ALL FILES in the <UNIX> archive are stored in ASCII.

     With the exception of the CATALOG FILES to be described later, ALL FILES
in the  <SIGM>, <CPMUG>  and  <PC-BLUE>  archives are stored in ITS binary,
a format  which had its origin  at MIT.   Each file  begins with  a  36-bit
identifier-word containing DSK8 in SIXBIT code.  This reads as 446353300000
in octal, and 933AD8000 in hexadecimal.  All data are stored as four 8-bit
bytes per 36-bit SIMTEL20 word, with the low-order four bits of each word
filled with zeros.  If such a file is interpreted as a contiguous string,
as will happen if a straight binary transfer is made to a 16 or 32-bit UNIX
machine, the four zero filler-bits per 36-bit group will cause rather bizarre
and frustrating results.  The methods for dealing with this situation, which
differ from machine to machine, are explained in a following paragraph.

     The ONLY files in the <SIGM>, <CPMUG> and <PC-BLUE> archives that are NOT
stored in ITS binary are the CATALOG files.  These files, which are stored in
ASCII, contain (in reverse numerical order) the -CATALOG.nnn files from all the
volumes of their respective archives.  To obtain these composite catalog
files, connect to SIMTEL20 via FTP and do this:

		get micro:<sigm>sigm.cat 
		get micro:<cpmug>cpmug.cat 
		get micro:<pc-blue>pc-blue.cat 

Remember, ALL are ASCII files.



FILE TRANSFER VIA FTP

     FTP stands for File Transfer Protocol, a formalized procedure for moving
files among machines on the Defense Data Network (DDN) and other networks that
connect with the DDN.  The protocol is implemented by a program called FTP.
The different mainframe operating systems implement FTP with variations in
command syntax.  Some systems have the remote-file-name precede the local-file-
name in the command.  Others reverse this order.  Some versions have the whole
command on a single input line, while others use multiple lines.  Read the
documentation for your local system, or consult a friendly system wizard
for the details of your local FTP command syntax.  FTP transfers from SIMTEL20
can be made with user-name "anonymous".  Use your host-name (or any string of
printing characters) for a password.

     Users of TOPS-10, TENEX, TOPS-20 or ITS systems can use "type image" or
"type paged" mode for ALL transfers.  UNIX users must use "type ascii" mode 
for ASCII files, and "type tenex" or "type L 8" mode for ITS binary files.
MULTICS users must use "type ascii" mode for ASCII files, and "type image"
mode for ITS binary.

     Once an ITS binary file has been transferred to your mainframe, additional
processing is needed to make it into a standard CP/M file.  This processing is
done automatically by the programs used on TOPS-20 and ITS machines for
downloading to a micro, so those users need not be concerned with this.  UNIX
users have only to remove the first four bytes of each file.  These four bytes 
are a special "ITS header", and are not really a part of the file.  They can
be removed using the UNIX utility "dd", or they can be removed using the
program ITSCVT, available as an ASCII-transferable .HEX file in directory
MICRO:<CPM.HEX>.

     Post-processing of files on MULTICS machines can be done using a modified
version of the system copy utility.  At present, transfer of this program is
a delicate matter because of the need to preserve the vendor's proprietary
rights.  If you need this utility, send a message to INFO-CPM-REQUEST, and
I'll put you in touch with the person who has the program.

     Anyone who can obtain an exact contiguous copy of an ITS binary file 
(probably using "type image" mode), and then download it to a CP/M machine
without losing any bits, can post-process the file into standard format using a 
CP/M program available from INFO-CPM-REQUEST.  If there is enough interest in 
this program, it can be added to the <CPM> archive.  If it necessary for you to
take this route, study the description of ITS binary format given in the 
section on FILE TYPES, so that you will know what to expect.  This method 
worked satisfactorily with transfers to our 16 and 32-bit UNIX machines before
we learned to use "type tenex" mode.



MAINFRAME PROGRAMS FOR TRANSFERRING FILES BETWEEN MAINFRAMES AND MICROS

Christensen Protocol:

     For a micro to reliably exchange files with a mainframe, cooperating
file transfer programs with automatic error detection and retransmission of
faulty blocks must be running on both computers.  One such family of programs
uses a popular protocol created by Ward Christensen and enhanced by others.  
Directory MICRO:<UNIX.CPM> contains two programs, UC and the older UMODEM
(both written in C), which implement this protocol on UNIX machines.  See the
file MICRO:<UNIX>UNIX.CRCLST for a list of other useful UNIX utilities.

     On ITS machines, file transfer using the Christensen protocol can be done
using MMODEM (type :MMODEM for instructions), or LMODEM.  Documentation for
LMODEM is in file .INFO.;LMODEM HELP. Other useful ITS utilities include TYPE8,
which types an ASCII file stored in ITS binary format; TYPESQ, which types an
ITS binary format "squeezed" file (see the first paragraph under FILE TYPES);
USQ, which creates an unsqueezed version of a squeezed file; HEXIFY, which
creates an Intel hex format file from an ITS binary format COM file; COMIFY
which creates a COM file from an Intel hex file; and CRC, which computes the
Cyclic Redundancy Check value for a file, using the same algorithm that is used
by the CP/M program CRCK.  Brief instructions for any of these utilities except
LMODEM can be obtained by typing ":utility_name" (for example, :CRC).

     TOPS-20 utilities for transferring and manipulating files can be found in
directory MICRO:<CPM.TOPS-20>.  See MICRO:<CPM>CPM.CRCLST for a list of
available programs.

     File transfer and conversion utilities for use with VAX/VMS machines are
contained in directory MICRO:<CPM.VAXVMS>.  See MICRO:<CPM>CPM.CRCLST for
details.


Kermit:

     Another excellent program for transferring files is called KERMIT.  This
program has the advantage of being available for an impressively large number
of mainframes and micros.  It is, for example, available for the IBM-PC, and
DOES NOT require CP/M.

     To get started with KERMIT, connect to Columbia-20 using FTP, and do this:

		get ps:<kermit>00readme.txt 
		dir ps:<kermit> 

Note two things:  The machine name is "columbia-dash-twenty", and the filename
begins with "zero-zero".

     After reading 00README.TXT, look at your directory listing and see what's
currently available (it may have changed since the last edit of 00README.TXT).
From then on, you are on your own.  Questions can be addressed to INFO-KERMIT @
COLUMBIA-20.



MICROCOMPUTER PROGRAMS FOR TRANSFERRING FILES BETWEEN MAINFRAMES AND MICROS

Christensen Protocol:

     An excellent program for transferring files between micros, or between
micros and mainframes is called MDM7xx, where the "xx" is replaced with two
digits to give the current version number.  This program, often referred to as
MODEM7 (the name of its easier to pronounce ancestor), uses the popular
Christensen protocol to transfer files with automatic error detection and
retransmission of erroneous blocks.  

     To get started with MDM7xx, you should first FTP and examine three files
from the directory MICRO:<CPM.MODEM7>.  After connecting to SIMTEL20, do this:

		get micro:<cpm.modem7>(see below) 
		get micro:<cpm.modem7>mdm7xx.doc 
		get micro:<cpm.modem7>mdm7xx.msg 

All are ASCII files.  Together, they will tell you just about all there is to
know about getting the program to run on your machine.  Take the time to read
these files; they're quite informative. You will also get some helpful insights
from reading some of the overlay files.  These overlays, described in file
MICRO:<CPM.MODEM7>(see below), are used to customize MDM7xx for particular
machines without having to edit and assemble the huge MDM7xx source file. 
Complete instructions for performing this procedure are contained in each 
overlay file.  The above use of "see below" refers to a file with the
characters "OVL" in its name.  This message will be updated when the name of
that file becomes stable (at this moment, there are two).


Kermit:

     As stated in an earlier paragraph, KERMIT is also an excellent program for
transferring files between computers.  It, too, does automatic error detection 
and retransmission, and it works between mainframe and micro, between micros,
and between mainframes.  See the earlier paragraph for details.


Getting Started:

     In order to get MDM7xx or KERMIT running on your micro, you must first
transfer the necessary files from mainframe to micro.  If you already have a
receive-to-disk communications program of some sort, you can use it to move
the needed files.  It is VERY CONVENIENT to be able to transfer 8-bit binary
files, although in most cases it is not absolutely necessary.  Some of the 
files are quite large.  For example, MDM7xx.COM is over 18K bytes, and the HEX
file (which you will need if you can't transfer 8-bit files) is over 52K.  
Moving large files to your micro without using an error detecting protocol can
result in frustrating errors, but it can be done by receiving multiple copies
and using manual or machine-assisted comparisons to locate and repair bad parts
of the code.  However, there IS a better way.

     Directory MICRO:<CPM.MODEM> contains a file that can be FTPed to your
mainframe, printed, and then entered into your micro by hand and assembled. 
It is quite short.  To examine this option, connect to SIMTEL20 via FTP and
do this:

		get micro:<cpm.modem>pipmodem.asm 
		get micro:<cpm.modem>pipmodem.doc 
		get micro:<cpm.modem>mboot3.asm 

All are ASCII files.  Read PIPMODEM.DOC first, then look at MBOOT3.ASM.
PIPMODEM.DOC explains the situation very nicely.  Questions concerning these 
programs should be sent to INFO-CPM @ AMSAA.



ADDITIONS, IMPROVEMENTS AND CORRECTIONS

     Suggestions for additions, improvements and corrections to this message
are always welcome.  Please send them to INFO-CPM-REQUEST.  Additional
information concerning FTP is, however, beyond the scope of this message.  If
you need help with FTP, please read the documentation for your local system,
or see your friendly system wizard.

     Contributions of public domain software are actively solicited.  If you
have something that seems appropriate for inclusion in the <CPM> archive, 
please contact Keith Petersen <W8SDZ@SIMTEL20>.  Likewise, contributions to the
<UNIX> archive can be addressed to Richard Conn <RCONN@SIMTEL20>.

     Happy hacking!

I would like to use some of the C programs that have been discussed as being
on SIMTEL20, but I don't know how to access the machine. Could someone please
furnish me with the DDD or UUCP access for this machine?

Modem7 does not do any terminal emulation, it just sends things 
to your machine and lets it do whatever it does-- in the case 
of your Kaypro 2, that is ADM3a plus a couple extras.  If you use
unix, the following termcap will describe Kaypro to the mainframe
so that with modem7 you can use vi, emacs, etc.

The terminal mode in MDM7xx just passes the data to your terminal.
Your Kaypro looks like an ADM3A so if you use that terminal definition
on your mainframe host, cursor addressing should work.  Make sure your
overlay for MDM7 does not have the "filter control characters below
line feed" equate turned on.  Otherwise cursor addressing won't work
right because you won't get all the control codes.

If you want a VT-52 emulator for your Kaypro, get KERMIT from
Columbia-20.  They have a version for the Kaypro.

What these files do:

ENSOFT.COM -  A program to convert an ASCII text file to Wordstar
document mode.  Makes educated guesses about where to put soft and
hard carriage returns as well as soft spaces.


UNSOFT.COM - A program to convert Wordstar document-mode files to
normal ASCII text files.  Resets all high order bits added by Wordstar
to zero.  Removes all control characters except TAB, FF, CR and LF.
Strips out dot commands except .PA which it converts to FF.  Changes
the 1FH soft hyphen at end-of-line to a real 2DH hyphen.  (FILTX2
would totally remove the character.)  Handles non-break-space
correctly.  Type UNSOFT ? for additional information.	

    NOTE:  If for any reason you do not wish to retain FF (form feed)
	   characters, you can run the program through FILTX.COM after
	   first using UNSOFT.COM.

NSWP2 has this quirk that cost me some time.  If you have your BDOS set
up to make user 0 public and you try to copy or rename a file from user
0 to another user, only the first extent gets moved. Since no source is
at hand, all you can do until it gets fixed is avoid using NSWP2 to move
files from user 0 to another user while user 0 is public.  If anyone
knows of a version that has this fixed, please let me know (either
PICONET CP/M or RICHARD RELPH).
 
Other than this bug, the program has the really nice feature (for those
who make user 0 public) that it does not use the BDOS to find out what
files are members of the user area, which means that it will not show
user 0 files while in user 1.

Thanks for passing along the info. I have another major gotcha. I don't
yet know enough about it to say what all the pertinent circumstances are
but when I tried mass copying from c0 to b0 (1 .def, 6 .com, 3 .ovl) the
result was that the .def file moved ok, but the .com and .ovl files
got truncated to 16k (I presume this to be the buffer size in NSWP202).
I entered NSWP202 from c3. I'll be doing more research when I can better
afford to lose files (as soon as I clear another cartridge). I'd like
to be able to contact those in the know directly. Should I call Dave or
is there someone else to go through?

Irv,
    Pulled down NSWP2, largely because of your comments on the board.
Found a bug right away!  On entry, Rand saves only the top entry of the
CP/M stack as his return point, not the CP/M stack pointer.  This is, of
course, enormously different, and makes the assumption that only the top
of stack was relevant at entry to the application.  As luck would have
it, my bank-switching system locks up tight due to this fault.  As this
is not a run-of-the-mill problem, I decided to call Rand about the prob-
lem.  What a waste of money!  I have never, in talking to author's of
public domain software, encountered a more arrogant, conceited individ-
ual.  He tells me that the fault is in my system, but nowhere do I find
a spec which guarantees that only the top entry of the stack need be
saved on entry to the application program.  I suspect that this approach
would cause problems when used from within programs like wordstar, with
the run command.  I believe this is the same symptom which I reported to
you on your one of your earlier programs, which you promptly chnaged for
me.  I know that this is the same problem as I reported to Frank Gaude'
on DISK7 and COMM7 where he used the same system you original developed
that Rand is apparently still using.  Thought you might want to pass it
along, I've given up...

To let you know what I have, I'm running a Big Board II with CP/M 2.23B
which has a built in 1793 for my floppies (1 Persci 277) and a built in
SASI I/F for my 2 IOMEGA 10Mby cartridge drives. I am using 9 1k sectors
on the Persci for a total per 8"SSDD disk of 670k (after directories).
The Persci is drives A and B and the IOMEGA is Drive C (right now the
BIOS cannot handle the other IOMEGA or even ther rest of the first).  I
was trying to copy from C to B, which implies that (other than picking a
bit) the hardware is probably ruled out as well as anything in the BIOS
past the section that determines which driver to call (which is first as
you would expect).  Thanks for taking the time to look at it.  I, too,
will be trying some more experiments here and will let you know.

There's a conversion program at SIMTEL20 (MICRO:<CPM.HEX>, i think),
called ITSCVT.HEX. It runs on an 8080 CP/M micro, and effectively strips
off the headers and tailers the ITS-binary files have.  For a PC now...
Another way I do it is to move them to my host's directory (a Dec),
copy them from their original ..32-bit, I think.. size to 8-bit, load
them into a host text editor (XED), which effectively strips off the
8th bit, edit out the 4 characters at the front, and the ^Zs at the
last line, and there I am.  For .COM files (binary), I move them to my
micro any way I can (HEXIFY is also available at SIMTEL20 (MICRO:
<CPM.TOPS-20>, I think), that'll run on the DEC and change the binary
file to HEX).

Alternatively, CPM.TOPS-20 also has NMODEM, a mainframe modem program
running on the DECs that'll send an ITS-binary file right through to you,
automatically detecting and stripping/reformatting.

Hope this helps.

Re:   QK20

I seem to have a problem with the new QK. If I try to run SD79 or
XD3 (under ZCPR2) they both fail to work. Under QK12, I had no problem.
It appears that all I get sent to the screen from SD79 when called
by a QK20 re-defined key is a CR-LF, and Ctl-C does not abort, I must
reset the system. Any clues?

Subject: Public-ness of UCSD Pascal Versions
Article-I.D.: felix.216


Long ago, in a fledging publication ("Infoworld") Adam Osborne penned
a column modestly named "From the Fountainhead."  In one of these
columns he stated his view of the legal status of various versions
of the UCSD Pascal P-system (Trademark the Regents of the University
of California).  As I recall Versions 1.2, 1.3, and 1.4 were characterized
as public domain and addresses and/or phone numbers were published
for where to get them.  I.5 and II.0 were characterized as claimed
to be non-public and hence deeded over to Softech Microsystems.

To my knowledge II.1 is legitimately Apple's and Northstar's is legitimately
theirs because their licenses were among the few irrevocable ones granted
early on in the project.  Also IV.x are legitimately Softech Microsystems,
since they were mainly developed after the turnover.  

My question is: Has the status of I.5 and II.0 been clearly determined?
Are they contestably public domain?  I heard that Mike Lehman at one
time was distributing I.5; if so this would seem to mean that it had
been determined to be public.

I would appreciate anyone having information on this subject replying
to me by mail.  I will summarize and post to the net if anything
new turns up.  In particular I would like to re-discover the contact
information for the older versions that are known to be public.

library with M7LIB.COM from simtel20, but after listing the library and
asking if it looks right, it says "library not found" and throws me
into cp/m? what's the matter with it?

Subject: 5.25" disk drives
Article-I.D.: ucf-cs.1221

For Sale:  Nearly new DSDD 5.25" disk drives.  80  tracks  double
sided  means over 700k each formatted.  Usable with most systems,
I have used them on an IBM-PC and on a Lobo Max-80 without  prob-
lems.   These are thinlines, and come with power supply and case,
and a cable for edge card connection.  I am selling them  because
I no longer have a system to use them on.

Original cost:  $389 each per drive
		$100 for case and power supply
		$ 40 for cable
		----
		$918 total for two drives, PS, cable and case.

First $600 takes it away,  providing you can find  an  acceptable
way to transfer the funds.  I am a little shy of sending this off
to a total stranger without some sort of collateral, and I'm sure
the same goes for you.

Does anyone have a suggestion on how to stop this - its been going on for

--------
The SD v 8.0 SORT fix  6 statements after label L3 (MVI A,11)
is causing some multi-extent files to be reported too small--
e.g. 32K instead of 76K.  Behavior seems to require several alphabetically
similar names in the listing, e.g ABC.ASM, ABC.COM.  Bug disappears
with MVI A,12.
This test was made on hand-modified vers SD 7.9 after reading v 8.0
listing in the SORT routine area.
When MVI A,12 is restored I presume the documented bug still exists, then?

Don't forget that you must change the byte in the overlay
that allows control codes to get through MODEM7 out to
the screen driver. Otherwise the cursor-positioning, etc.
may not work, since the defualt is that MODEM7 filters
out control codes except (I think) CR, LF, and BS.

There was a message about this on info-cpm about a week ago.

I am trying to install ZCPR under CP/M 2.2 and it almost works.
However, when given the name of a .COM file to execute it merely echos
the name of the file followed by a question mark (standard error stuff
when it can't find a file, I think).  Anyone got any suggestions as to
what is going wrong?

I am running the MICAH SuperBios on a Cromemco System III.

Thanks very much,

I don't have your particular problem, but my mailbox does fill up
awfully fast.  Most of the stuff on here is good, but occasionally (like
last week) it partially degenerates into flaming, which is a waste of
time and disk space.  So, two requests:

1)  No flaming.  If someone is screwing up, we don't all need to know.

2)  If you're replying to a specific, system-dependent question of
someone else's, please if at all possible reply only to that person.  My
mailbox is full of specifics that aren't going to help anyone without a
specific configuration.  I'm not saying that this is true of everyone,
because most of the stuff on here can be useful to many people, but just
keep this in mind.

Even though they are long, I like the lists of software.  Do archives,
or at least pointers to content of archives, exist anywhere on the
arpanet?

				Thanks,
				Robert

You raise interesting questions.  My mad friend was so upset by
the UCSD Pascal situation that he was actually beginning a
lawsuit on the theory that public money developed it, and it
thus belonged to the public.  He never got far, because it was
about then that he began wasting away with cancer.  It might
have been interesting to see what would have happened.

If you'll send a hard copy detailing your difficulties
(specifics like dates and the like would help) we'll see what
can be done; I find by and large that when I send in a paper it

Priority One doesn't really give ANYONE support for stuff they
sell; I have a color board for the PC that won't work with
anytyhing but a couple of specific terminals although there is
nothing in the ads that say that.  We are having fun with
Priority One which sold it to us.
	CompuPro is trying very hard to get out of the direct
support business because they ship too much stuff to be able to
do that.  Generic solutions to problems are more useful: in your
case, for instance.  
	Mostly they hope you will buy their stuff through a
Systems Center and get support from that.  Priority One sells a
LOT of CompuPro stuff but at a very low profit margin and they
just don't do no support at all; leaving the troops in Hayward
to wonder what to do.
	I dunno either; but in your case, if you'll let me know,
maybe something can be made to happen.  As a general
proposition, though, I find CompuPro stuff rock solid, but it is
getting harder and harder to talk to the people in Hayward
unless you know them well.
	They also have another type of chap: the ones who add
nonstandard stuff, hack things, and tehn complain that it
doesn't work...  I have a drawer full of their complaints, but
not much sympathy for them (why doesn't my belchly board work
with ...)

David,

I am writing a book on ZCPR3, and this will address your questions
in much greater detail.  In a nutshell, ZCPR1/ZCPR2/ZCPR3 do not address
programs which use overlays.  Such would require a BDOS modification.
There is a way around this problem, however, with ZCPR3.  As I mentioned,
one feature of ZCPR3 is the alias.

The alias allows the user to define a sophisticated command line which
is executed in place of a simple command issued by the user.  I am running
WS and dBASE II, as well as BDS C, C/80, and PASCAL/MT+ under ZCPR3,
and, by using a combination of aliases and ZEX command files, all are
fitting into the ZCPR3 environment.

Each commercial program must be addressed independently,
since they all handle things differently.  WS, for instance, will, when
not finding its overlays in the current directory, drop down to disk A,
current user and look there.  Hence, I use WS only from a directory called
TEXT, where TEXT is B7: and WS.COM and its overlays, including a spelling
checker, are in A7:.  The search path is A$ A15 (including current dir
by default), so issuing WS from B7 will find WS.COM in A7 (the A$
part of the path expands into A7 when the command is issued from d7).

When it comes to program editing, I use WM, which requires not overlays
and optionally can use a HLP file (which will be found in A$ if not found
in the current dir).  WM is in the root (A15), so it is found from anywhere on
the system.

dBASE II was quite different in that it had to have its overlays in
the current directory.  To get around this problem, I created an alias
which, in response to the command DB2, will issue the following
command sequence:

		A9:;dbase setup;$d$u:

where:

		A9: -- logs me into the directory containing DBASE.COM
			and its overlays
		dbase setup -- runs DBASE.COM, and SETUP.CMD contains
			the command "set default to B:", which places
			me into B9: to do the work; when I issue the
			"quit" command, the last command is executed:
		$d$u: -- returns me to the directory I was in originally

Finally, with the three languages I mentioned above, all support the ability
to indicate where the required overlays are located.  ZEX command files are
used to do the compilation, linking, and cleanup.  Also, for each language,
the files supporting the compilers and linkers are in An: while the work areas
are in Bn:, such as A2: containing BDS C compiler and linker while B2:
contains the files I am working on.

You will see more on this when the book comes out.

	Rick

The pricing for the MI-286 board (I prefer to call it the Oakland Raider or the Mach2) is tentatively set for $1395 (less than I thought it would be),
with an additional charge of $650 (ouch) for inclusion of an 80287. This
board will be supplied with 6MHz CPU's; it is designed to work with an 8MHz 80286 when they become available.

A major market for this board is to breathe some new life into MP/M-816
systems, so you can be sure that it will be designed as a drop-in
replacement on such systems.

Steve - FTP is a network protocol.  What goes out on the network must conform
to that protocol.  Therefore, on the network, it all looks the same.  Locally,
however, there are syntax differences among the different implementations.  
The question, then, is not how SIMTEL20 or COLUMBIA-20 does it, but how YOUR
LOCAL SYSTEM does it.  To find that out, you MUST seek advice LOCALLY.  Find
the name of your host administrator, and ask him/her to point you in the right
direction.

Subject: Rainbow 100-A SETHARD program

For the person with the Rainbow 100 winnie upgrade:
	The following is the program that pokes magic locations in the
Rainbow BIOS to fool the system into thinking it booted off the winchester.
 
 - Get this source on your Rainbow, and edit to taste 
	(I acutally set both boot and default to E:)
 - Assemble and link 
 - copy all files you want onto the winchester
 - make a copy of your bootable floppy system disk
 - delete every thing except SETHARD.CMD, CPM.SYS, and Z80CNF.SYS
 - boot the system off your new disk
 - run SETHARD and it will think that E: is the boot disk
 - you do even better by patching SETHARD into the initial command buffer
   for execution at startup time.
 
 Disclaimer: I use this program, but I am not responsible for it's coding
or functions.  It is based on carnal knowledge of the Rainbow CP/M BIOS
and may break in future releases.

Subject: SD-81 now available

Thanks to our Info-Cpm readers a bug in SD-80 was uncovered and Sigi
Kluger has just released SD-81, which I just uploaded to SIMTEL20.
Here's a list of the files: 

Filename			Type	 Bytes	 Sectors     CRC

Directory MICRO:<CPM.DIRUTL>
SD-79A.DOC.1			ASCII	  9525   75 =  4BH  D733H
SD-79A.DQC.1			COM	  6144   48 =  30H  2D4BH
SD-81.AQM.1			COM	 53248  416 = 1A0H  F3D9H
SD-81.ASM.1			ASCII	 78722  616 = 268H  B1B8H
SD-81.NOT.1			ASCII	  2689   22 =  16H  3ECCH
SD-81H.COM.1			COM	  3584   28 =  1CH  49AEH
SD-81H.HEX.1			ASCII	  8745   69 =  45H  DD3FH
SD-81V.COM.1			COM	  3968   31 =  1FH  F321H
SD-81V.HEX.1			ASCII	  9680   76 =  4CH  7563H
SD8081.DIF.1			ASCII	  3401   27 =  1BH  15A1H

The last one, SD8081.DIF, is an SSED2 editor script for those who got
SD-80.ASM so they don't have to download the whole .ASM file again.

Here's a note from Sigi about the update:

04/04/84 S. Kluger El Paso RCPM

First off... sorry for the mess-up in SD-80. Sometimes it helps if you
know what you're doing!

Anyway, the bug is now fixed and that with an extra bonus... Seems like
the way SD has been working right now, it would get mighty confused with
extremely large files. To backtrack a bit, filesize is stored in the
directory as follows:

ENTRY+12	EX  (extent number 0..31)
ENTRY+14	S2  (extent overflow 0..31)
ENTRY+15	RC  (record count in last extent)

This means that the largest extent number is 1FH. In order to allow files
larger than 512k, the S2 byte is used. S2 is incremented every time EX
is incremented to 20H. EX is then zeroed. The highest number in S2 is 0F.
EX and S2, therefore, form a 9-bit number. The least significant bits
0..4 being EX, the most significant bits 5..8 being S2. That 9-bit number
is the total number of extents possible. Multiplied by 16k, we get 8192k,
the maximum file (and disk) size under CP/M 2.2.

(If I have bored you so far, please realize that many people out there
don't know this)

In SD, the file size was stored as a 2-byte value, one byte being the
total number of extents, the other being the number of sectors in the
last extent. From the previous explanation it should be easy to see that
you can't fit a 9-bit value into a byte. SD up to version 8.1 therefore
truncated all files over 4MB to 4096k. In SD-81, the file size is stored
as a normal (as opposed to byte-reversed) 16-bit integer in sector units
(8192k = 65536 sectors).

Not feeling a desire to perform a major rewrite, I did not change the fact
that SD loads and sorts ALL directory entries and then scans the list
for the highest numbered extent and displays it. The main reason for
changing it would be to save space and to possibly speed the program
up insignificantly. Should anyone ever tackle this, please make SD report
correct file sizes for random files with holes. (One way of doing it would
be to scan the directory and add up the RC fields of all like file names).

There still is a bug in the vertical display routine. It is my opinion that
vertical display best be left to XDIR, but again, if someone desires to
fix it up to look neat, be my guest. The vertical display currently loses
track sometimes and displays a blank line rather than file names. This
occurs with a very crowded directory (I noticed it with ~260 entries).
Also, the directory should be alphabetized by screenful.

If you find any serious problems with SD-81 which are obviously related
to my fixes, please be sure to let me know immediately. Do not mail any
explosives no matter how bad the bugs, please...

We (Widener Consulting) have been distributing USR modems over a year.  
We encountered the DTR problem with our first S100's, and now ship 
all of them with the mod for normal DTR operation.  The mod is

1. Remove D17 (disables separate relay control)
2. Cut the trace from U3 pin 32 to ground (3/8" above U7-1 on back side).
3. Connect the DTR~ pin (U22-24) to U3-32 (pin 32 is modem disable).
   Run a wire from the U22 side of D17 to the cut trace by U7.

Simple, but USR hasn't done it, even though I told them to a long time 
ago.  Warranty is no problem (if you get it through us, since USR knows
that we are doing the mod).

Has anyone tried QK20?  I tried it on 2 different systems, one a

Re:   QK20

I seem to have a problem with the new QK. If I try to run SD79 or
XD3 (under ZCPR2) they both fail to work. Under QK12, I had no problem.
It appears that all I get sent to the screen from SD79 when called
by a QK20 re-defined key is a CR-LF, and Ctl-C does not abort, I must
reset the system. Any clues?

Re:   Problem with QK20

     I have noted that there is a rather serious problem
with QK20.  Specifically, if the program executing does
any direct BIOS console input calls, the Qwikkey program
behaves very erratically.  If the key depressed is one
of the keys for which a substitution string has been
entered, the result will be either (a) key is altogether
ignored, (b) program will abort, or (c) system will hang
up with cold boot required.  If the key depressed is not
one of the keys for which a substitution string has been
entered, the result will be either (a) key is altogether
ignored, (b) program will appear to abort (i.e, A> prompt
appears, next char entered jumps back to program at last
prompt, char is not accepted), or (c) system will hang
up with cold boot required.  Sometimes the program exe-
cuted aborts without doing anything at all (e.g, LDIR).
Recommend you not download this pgm.  --Regards, DQ

It has been noticed that there are several cases of a
Copyright notice being applied to public domain software.
While this right does accrue to the publisher of his
'original' work; and whereas he may wish to make that work
available to the public for their royalty-free use with a
restriction applied against sale, he may specifically not:

     1. Copyright what he or others have already put into
     the public domain.

     2. Delete the Copyright notices of others pertaining to
     a portion of the work.

     3. Fail to give credit to the work of others that he has
     used or copied even if it is in the public domain - unless
     there is no reasonable means for identifying the work of
     others. Even this last, is not a condition for claiming
     'original' authorship (a necessary condition precedent to
     the right to Copyright).

Some of the violations have been under the mis-understanding
that the Copyright prevents others from changing the revision
level when it is part of the name of the work, such as MDM730,
but that it is Ok if one renames it, modifies the work, and then
publishes it with all the same code (but with new code added).
WRONG, if the 'work', which must be the actual writing of the
author claiming protection -not just his ideas or naming, is subject
to valid protection, that protection does not include the name
of the work. This is the purpose of Trademarks - not to infringe on
the trade-marked name of a product since presumably this would
damage the business of the Trademark (MUST BE REGISTERED) holder
in a financial way.  It is hard to see how this would apply to
public domain software.  Also, one would have to show as a condition
precedent to getting a duly registered Trademark that the 'Mark'
has not already been placed in the public domain by the applicant
or by others. Also, guess a new registration would have to be
obtained for MDM731, MDM732 etc - an expensive proposition.
Of course, one could also abandon the name, call it something
else, get a "Mark' registered and do what he wishes with it as
long as he doesn't also Copyright it as his original work.  This
would then at least allow the continuation in the 'public' of
the well-known generic name of MODEM7, MDM7 etc - with the op-
erative part of the name giving the immediate public recognition
being the '7' which denotes that modification, and its successors,
of the 'Christensen' protocol that includes batch mode which was
added by Mills and Zeigler and Copyrighted (the additional routines
only) by them in 1980 - and made public. 

Any of you lawyers out there wish to comment on this practice
so that those who have been mis-informed can correct their
ways? Copyright of software that others have put in the public
domain is not only not-nice, but damaging to the whole spirit
and purpose of the 'public-domain' idea.

A few days ago, I had a call from a mildly irate user of NSWP2. He claimed
that NSWP failed on the 'X' command, and proceeded to tell me why. I can
find no reason behind his logic, so here it is... if someone has an
idea, PLEASE let me know!

In NSWP, I don't jump to zero when I exit. Instead, I do what amounts to a
return to the CCP. The actual code involved goes like this...

	XTHL		;get contents of (SP) into HL
	SHLD CCPRET+1	;save it as part of a JMP instruction
	LXI  SP,STACK	;and move stack local

later on, when I want to return to CP/M, I use:

CCPRET:	JMP 0000h	;to be filled in

The users' system was a heavily modified CPM 2.2 system, that included
bank selected memory. He says, however, that had I have done things
'correctly', I should have used the following code:

	lxi h,0		;offset zero
	dad sp		;from stack pointer
	shld CCPSTK+1	;and save old stack address
	LXI  SP,STACK	;and move stack local

and to return to the CCP:

CCPSTK:	lxi SP,0	;to be filled in
	ret		;get back!

Now... You know, and I know, that JMPing to the address on the top of the
stack is EXACTLY the same as RET'ing, except that I don't preserve the stack.
But DR's CCP, along with all CCP replacements, ALWAYS use the code:

	CALL	100h	;execute transient program
	LXI	SP,LOCS	;restore stack, in case we get back.

except for CPM 3.0, which uses

	LXI	H,0	;return address of warm boot!
	push	h
	jmp	100h	;execute transient

What I think, is that his CCP (which has been modified by him), DOES NOT
do the LXI SP. However, I am open to suggestions. By the way, he is the
ONLY user (from the 50 or so that have contacted me) that has reported this
problem.

I am mystified. He claims that the LXI SP is there. If that is the case
(which I don't believe), magic must be occuring. If anyone can explain
to me the difference between the JMP and the RET, I would forever be in
your debt!

Thanks in advance... Dave Rand

Subject: M7LIB.COM bug fixed

Irv Hoff has just released a revised M7LIB.COM.  It's now on
SIMTEL20, in place of the previous version.  Irv didn't change
the name, unfortunately.  There is a way of telling if you have
the new version though.  Here's Irv's info on the fixes:

---
TOPIC	: M7LIB FIX
FROM	: IRV HOFF W6FFC
DATE	: 06 APR 84

       NOTE: IF YOUR COPY OF M7LIB.COM SAYS 04/06/84
	     WHEN BROUGHT UP, IT HAS THE FOLLOWING
	     FIX INCORPORATED AND NEEDS NO CHANGES.

   BACKGROUND:	M7LIB.COM is used to alter phone numbers in the
		MDM730.COM modem program.  Unfortunately I based
		it on a buggy, obsolete program called CHGLIB v1.0
		dated Jan 82.

   PROBLEM   :	If the 'R' (re-read the phone listing) is typed at
		ANY TIME when using M7LIB.COM, it will only write
		back to disk about 2-1/4k of the 18-1/4k via 'W'.
		Obviously this is unacceptable.

   SOLUTION 1:	Do not use 'R' at any time.  Few apparently use it
		anyway, or this problem would have been noticed and
		fixed much sooner.

   SOLUTION 2:	Use DDT and change:

		026C  32 76 08	change to 00 00 00   then save 8.

	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	-

   HOW TO    :	If you are unfamiliar with using DDT, do this:

			A>DDT M7LIB.COM

			-S026C		(you add the S026C,  return)
			026C 32 00	(you add the 00, hit return)
			026D 76 00	(you add the 00, hit return)
			026E 08 00	(you add the 00, hit return)
			026F CD .	(you add the . then  return)
			-G0		(you add the G0,  it returns
					to CP/M prompt, then:

			A>SAVE 8 M7LIB.COM   (saves the fixed pgm)

	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	-
	
   COMMENT   :	I fixed my own in this manner, and it works normally now
		no matter if/how/when 'R' is used.  This had been tested
		when writing the program, but the associated problem was
		not noticed.

   NOTE      :	You can also use M7NM-6.ASM to change the library with
		your editor, etc.  That is an easier method if you want
		to make numerous changes or rewrite the phone library.
		M7LIB.COM is fast, easy and simple, intended to be used
		to change a few numbers occasionally.

Notes on NSWP 204
-----------------

NSWP 204 has a few new features! First, limited CPM 3 has been established,
in that if you have BDOS version over 3.0 (which may include MPM), you may
now run with ALV banked. NSWP will use the BDOS call to obtain the ALV
information. This also applies to the 16 bit version.

Before 204, if you attempted to delete a file that was currently tagged,
it was not removed from the tagged file size. It is correctly handled in all
cases now.

NSWP now saves the SP, rather than (SP), in order to support totally non-
standard implementations of BDOS and CCP.

When using the '?' function, the current disk information, along with the
tagged file size.

The copy file speed has been further optimized by elimination of a redundant
BDOS call (deleting a file, when we know it ain't there!).

NSWP has been modified to better support MPM and MPM86 by doing a rename
after a copy operation. This will drop the copy speed slightly, nullifying
the effect of the above change.

If you find anything else, please drop me a line...

Reply-to: kevinw@Su-Dsn.ARPA
From: Kevin W. Rudd <kevinw@Su-Dsn.ARPA>
Sender: kevinw@isl

having just scanned an article which mentions how to do a bug fix
to an existing distribution public domain program, i have noticed
what could be to many a very confusing issue.  this has to do with
how to put the patched software back to disk.

in cpm the solution is to use ddt to patch the software and then to
exit ddt back to the ccp and use the cpm SAVE command (having decoded
the size of the program from the ddt (or sid) logon message).

there is one problem with this approach with cpm-plus (aka cpm3) --
it won't work.  cpm-plus has a pre-execution save command which, upon
return to the system from the next run program, prompts you for the
address range to be saved and to what file.  easier to use, perhaps, but
much different in actual useage.  it could be used in a similar wa,
perhaps, but i have not tried it.  instead, one may use the W commad in
sid (as supplied by dri) -- it will write the program to a file or will
write a user supplied address range to a file as well.  there is a problm
in the default address range as it uses the address of the last loaded
module end location as the end location to save rather than the greatest
end location...  oooopppppssssss.  just what we expect frm dri though...

unfortunately, there is no easy solution to how to give instructions to
people to patch programs.  perhaps it would be better to have some kind
of program editor which will take a patch file and process it.  this program
would be written to work in a cpm or a cpm-plus system and would alleviate
any potential confusion which may arise from people trying to follow
instructions (or to determine which of several instructions) blindly.

In-reply-to: Msg of 8 Apr 1984  17:04-MST from Kevin W. Rudd <kevinw at Su-Dsn.ARPA>

Sigi Kluger has written a new program which will take an existing .COM
file and patch it with a specified .HEX file and then re-save the
patched version.  It's called MDMLNK and is available from SIMTEL20 in
the MICRO:<CPM.MODEM7> directory.  You'll find MDMLNK.COM/HEX/DOC
there.  Sorry I neglected to announce this very useful program.  It
allows MDM7xx users to patch in their overlays without using DDT.

Here's a copy of the .DOC file.  It's interesting reading.
--Keith

----
DOC FOR MDMLNK v1.00 as of 03-26-84

MDMLNK is a utility for MDM7xx. It allows linking in the assembled
overlay file without the use of DDT. This may be a bit more foolproof
than the usuall DDT method.

MDMLNK is self-prompting and will ignore all command line parameters.
Upon entry, MDMLNK will ask for the INPUT file name. Enter the name of
the uninstalled MDM7xx.COM file and be sure to specify the full file
name. Next, you are asked for the HEX file name. Enter the full name
of the assembled overlay file and be sure to include the .HEX suffix.
Last, you will be asked for the OUTPUT filename. Enter the name of
the installed MDM7xx file. Again, be sure to specify the full file name.

MDMLNK will now first read the INPUT file, overlay it with the hex file,
then write a temporary file which is finally renamed to the output file
name. The temporary file is used so that the input file can be the same
as the output file, yet a disk error will not wipe out the original.

Errors will be reported for full directory, unable to write (disk full),
file not found, and in case the hex file is corrupt. All errors will
abort to CP/M, possibly leaving a file MDMLNK.$$$.

MDMLNK not only works on any MDM7 file of any size (within reason), but
it can also (BONUS!!!) be used with XMODEM or any other file which
will be overlaid by a HEX file which does not change its size.

files are:

CPM-PERT.BAS - ASCII format (saved with ,A option)
SETUP.ASM    - This must be run before CPM-PERT in order to get hard

               by CP/M - but if your system uses that area for

I think the suggestion made a few messages back was very good.
Since patches occur frequently, there should be an AUTOPATCH program
written that will take a set of patches and apply them (correctly)
to one or more versions of a binary.  

This way, when a fix comes out, you just put out one or more AUTOPATCH
control files, as well as matching source code changes; people's 
binaries get fixed automatically, and you don't have to put out a major
release very often.  

Many computer companies do things this way (although usually just with
source code).

Of course, some standards as to binary format or symbol table
information have to be established...

What do you think?

Subject: Xerox 820 REVEALED#2--Monitor Jump Tables
Article-I.D.: psuvax.947

This article contains information about the monitor supplied with the
Xerox 820 board.  The Jump table has more entries in it than the manual
lets on.  I have figured out what some of the 'undocumented' ones
do, but the explanations that I have given may not show *all* of the 
features/ramifications of the functions.  There are 2 major jump tables
in the monitor, one which contains the low-level operations (F000-F042)
and one that contains jumps to the higher level operations (F7FD-F805).  The
manual (from BG Micro) only mentions the first 14 entries in the first
table.

Article-I.D.: psuvax.952

If you have gotten the power connected to your 820 and hooked  up
a  video monitor to the HS VS and VO pins on J7, you may have no-
ticed that only the left half of the screen shows, and the  right
half  seems to run off the right edge of the screen.  You are not
alone.  I got my board up a couple of days  ago,  and  I  thought
that  the problem was caused by the circuitry that I was using to
get composite video. After a couple of  hours  of  dedicated  (?)
work  with  an  oscilliscope  here at the computer lab, ace video
wizard Ralph Droms found that the horizontal sync signal that  is
available at J7 was much too long. Somewhere between J7 and where
it is generated, the signal gets perverted, and it kills half  of
the  screen.   Ralph  located a more reasonable signal to use for
the HS, and it works beautifully.  To use this new  and  improved
HS signal, forget about pin 4 on J7 and use pin 8 on U34 instead.

We found this error on both of our boards, so  there  is  a  good
chance  that it is on all of them.  Please let me know if this is
the case.

Happy Video!

Subject: Xerox 820 REVEALED#3--Monitor and CRT info
Article-I.D.: psuvax.948

This article contains information about the monitor commands and the
character set for the video display.


This is a list of the functions provided by the monitor for the Xerox 820.
They are accessable on powerup from the keyboard.

Command	Use
-------	-------------------------------------------------------------
Dump	Dad1 ad2
	Dumps addresses ad1 through ad2.  If ad1 is omitted, dumps
	0000 through ad2.  Output can be held/restarted by hitting
	a key.  2 CR's will stop function and return to monitor if
	you don't want to see the whole dump.

Memory	Mad1
	Prints contents of location ad1, and accepts changes.  To
	change, just type the new value (2 digits), to skip forward
	use CR, to skip backward use '-', any other to exit.

Xtest	Xad1 ad2
	Test for memory errors.  Prints a '+' each time a cycle is
	completed, 256 cycles for every combination to be tested.
	Prints bad addresses if it finds any. Dumb name for command.

Fill	Fad1 ad2 val
	Fills memory ad1 through ad2 with val.  Reads block back to
	check for memory errors and reports any if found.

Copy	Cad1 ad2 ad3
	Copies memory from ad1 through ad2 to memory starting at ad3.
	Compares copy with original and reports any differences to
	check for memory errors.

Goto	Gad1
	Does a CALL to ad1.  Control can be passed back to the monitor
	with a RET instruction.

Read	Runit trk sect
	Reads a sector from disk and prints it in dump format.  If an
	error occurs, it lets you know.  'disk error XX Uaa Tbb Scc'
	is the error where aa=unit number, bb=track number, cc=sector
	number, and XX is the 1771 error code:

	bit	R/W		Seek/Restore/Select
	---	------------	--------------------
	7	Drive not ready	Drive not ready
	6	WR Protected	(not used)
	5	WR Fault	(not used)
	4	Not found	Seek error
	3	CRC error	CRC error
	2	Lost data	Cannot restore
	1	(not used)	(not used)
	0	=1		=0

Boot	B (or A)
	Loads bootstrap loader from disk and jumps to it.  Reads tr0 sec1
	into 0080 and then jumps to 0080.  Loader cannot use bottom 256
	bytes of memory.

Type	T
	Converts millions(?) of dollars in research into an electric
	typewriter.  Reads from keyboard and outputs to printer port.
	Does not output to CRT.

Input	Iport
	Inputs byte from specified port and displays it.  CR will do the
	same for the next port, '-' will do it for the previous port, any
	other exits.

Out	Oport val
	Outputs value to specified port and returns to monitor.  Useful for
	initializing ports.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

CRT information

Control characters

Hex	Use
---	----------------------------------------------------------------------
00-07	None
08	Cursor left
09	Horizontal tab (tab stop every 8 postions)
0A	Linefeed
0B	Cursor up (wraps back to bottom of screen)
0C	Cursor right
0D	Carriage return
0E-10	None
11	Clear to end of screen
12-17	None
18	Clear to end of line
19	None
1A	Clear Screen
1B	Escape
1C-1D	None
1E	Home cursor
1F	Print char between 00 & 1F (special characters)

ESC is used for XY cursor positioning.  ESC+'='+rowchar+colchar is the form
where rowchar and colchar is the desired row/col with 32 added to it (20 hex).

The special characters are hidden in the control character section.  To print
a special character, prefix it with 1F.  To print more than one, prefix each
one with 1F.

The character set is standard ASCII from 20-7F.  The character set is repeated
in 80-FF with a blink attribute.  If the cursor is on a blank spot, the 
standard block cursor will be displayed.  If the cursor is on a character, the
blinking version of the character will automatically be displayed.

An auto patcher sounds like a great idea.  One feature I would like to 
see in it is verification of the code that was there before.  Some lines
near the beginning of a patch file would check the code to be replaced,
version numbers, etc., and warn the user if things didn't look right.

Related to this -- what do .com files look like, anyway?  Is their format
hidden somewhere in my CP/M manuals?

Actually, if there's a standard relocatable format, with symbol table
info, etc., that's probably a better thing to do patches on.

Also, the way programs like SCCS and RCS do changes, they leave identifier
strings in the binary, that can be searched for, and indicate version info
about the program.  No reason not to use this sort of approach, within
reason...

Subject:  Re:  What termnal does Mode7 emulate

I've found that my KayPro II, running MDM730, continues to emulate an
ADM-3A terminal, just like I was running TERM.COM. On our 4.2 UNIX
system the following termcap entry works well:
	kp|kaypro|kaypro2|kaypro 2:\
		:am:bs:li#24:co#80:\
		:cm=\E=%+ %+ :\
		:ho=^^:cl=1^Z:\
		:nd=^L:up=^K:do=^J:\
		:ce=^X:cd=^W:\
		:al=\EE:dl=\ER:

I have noticed a couple of minor glitches, but nothing I can't work
around.

By the way, full-screen stuff that works well with "set term=kaypro"
include rogue and vi.

In the winter of 1981 I purchased a very nice & simple S-100 clock
board from a company called QT Computer Systems, also known as
Quick & Timely. They were located in CA at a 213 area code. 
Alas, today it appears that they are gone. The number gets
me a sleepy homeowner, and the operator gets me nothing. Does any
one know what happened to them? Can I get my board serviced? I built
it from a kit back then, and  for various reasons it has sat untested
for the last three years. And it does not work! My best hardware
efforts have produced little, and chip swaps do nothing. Does anyone
have any ideas where they have gone? Do any netlandians have this board?
   Heaps of thanks in advance!

In response to both your questios:

1)  A .com file is simply a binary file containing a Z-80 (or 8080)
machine-language program.  It should cold start at 100H.

2)  Yes, there is a standard relocatable format.  It is not in the .com
file, however.  The hex file ("object" file produced by the assembler)
is what you want.  Original Intel hex format doesn't define the
necessary extensions, but there is a standard extension.  Unfortunately,
I do not remembe the proper format, but I shall look it up.  It is
consistent with the Intel hex, and an Intel loader will load the
program, without the relocating information.  It is not difficult to
patch -- I've done it before.  As usual, what is required is that the
jumps be re-calculated -- patching the hex file won't do that.  If you
don't have a hex file, patching something is difficult.  Of course, you
could write a program to recalculate jumps, but you have to be careful
not to munge data.

There are several C's available for CP/M80. 
1 - BDS C: Great to learn C with. Very fast compiler,
    respectable execution speed, source code of the libraries
    and a well supported user's group. But it is not a full
    implementation of C (lacks longs, floats, statics, and
    initializers). $150.
    
2 - MANX AZTEC CII: Very good compiler (I use it for 
    production work), full implementation, you get the source
    of the libraries, assembler output of the compiler can be
    further hand optimized, an 8086 and 6502 and PDP-11 
    versions are available. Fast execution speed, but 
    compilation speed can be improoved usin a hard disk or
    a ram disk. $199.
    
3 - Whitesmith's C: Don't touch it if you don't have to. 
    Incredibly slow compilation times, and their libraries
    do not resemble the other ones that I know. $600???

4 - Echo C: For Z-80 only. Heard good things, but never seen
    it.

5 - Supersoft C:I'd rather have Aztec C. Slower compilation
    times, not a full implementation (the version I have),
    and pain in the neck to develop software with (terrible
    linking problems -too much code gets included-).
    
In my opinion, most the other C compilers either serve a very
specific purpose, or are toy compilers (Tiny C, etc.).

Subject: Format of .com files
From: meier@isl

Michal,

	The format of .com files is a simple core map of the memory beginning at
hex address 100.  The first logical sector corresponds to addresses 100-17f, the
second sector to 180-1ff, etc.  The storage is contiguous and there is no
sentinel.  The eof is indicated when there are no more logical sectors associated
with that file.  When a load is performed, the .hex file (which uses at least
2 bytes per instruction byte) is used to load memory.  Then (assuming that
bios has not been overwritten), the memory contents are copied out to disk
starting at address 100 and proceeding to the highest address indicated in the
.hex file.

In partial reply to Jack Bicer's comment that "all other C's are toys"
or some such...

I use Software Toolworks C/80 2.0 (3.0 now available). It is at least
comparable to BDS/C and, at one third the cost, a better (here we go!) deal.
The BDS/C library stuff available at Simtel20 is easily modified for the
differences in the two C's. Benchmark programs published in back issues
of magazines such as BYTE (and perhaps Dr. Dobb's) have shown that C/80
is faster in execution than BDS/C. Compilation time is slower though. If
one wants to repeatedly edit-compile-run-debug-edit-... then BDS/C
is "better". If one wants something that runs faster after all the
debugging is done then C/80 is "better" (of the two, other compilers
ignored...).

C/80 2.0 lacks a number of things I'd like but it ain't no toy. I've
written MANY powerful programs with it without having to jump through
hoops to get the functionality that the C language provides.

No real flame intended, just a comment on what I consider to be a good
useful inexpensive C compiler...

According to the Glossary of Terms in the CP/M manuals I have,
it should be possible to set the $SYS attribute on .COM files
that are located in User 0, and then excute them from any other
user. (Note that this is only documented in the glossary, not
in the main body of the manual.) However, I find that this does
not work. Can someone confirm this for me? I have heard a rumor 
this feature was really only implemented in MP/M & CCP/M, and
possibly in CP/M V3.0. Clearly this is a desirable feature that
makes the User N concept extremely useful.

Alan,

I've used Whitesmith, Aztec and BDS.

Impressions:

Whitesmith runs too slow to be a useful too.  In addition, the standard
IO libraries are not Unix compatible, which makes it difficult to write
portable code.  Whitesmith is also expensive.

BDS see screams through your source code and spits out a com file in
record time.  It is only a subset of C,  if you can live with it, it is
an excellent tool.

Aztec C is the most Unix compatible C compiler I've seen on Cpm.  Its
performance to compile code is somewhere between BDS and Whitesmiths.
However, they advertise it is truly Unix compatible and it seems to be.

You might want to look at the August , 1983 issue of By te for more
information.

In order to avoid a fiery discussion, I said: 
  "In my opinion, most of the other C compilers either serve
  a very specific purpose, or are toy compilers (Tiny C,
  etc.)."
  
I agree with you about C/80, it not a toy compiler. It is 
what I consider to be very specific purpose -Low cost C 
compiler.- The same argument also applies to Small C (which
also comes with the source of the compiler. If you are trying
to upgrade from an assembler for a minimal cost, I agree with
you 100%. 

In my opinion, at least professional programmers, require a
little more than C/80.

Kevin (et al)

ARCHIVE is available for CP/M 2.2 - just needs a little (but well documented)
patch in the BDOS.  See SIMTEL20 (I forget which directory).  I have it,
and it works installed on my Morrow Decision I w/CP/M 2.2 just fine.  Only
undesirable effect is that D.COM no longer works correctly with wild cards.

Another simple patch (some code in the BIOS, and change one JMP in the
BDOS) gives you default access from any disk, any user area, to default disk
same user area and then to default disk user area 0 for .COM, .TXT, .HLP,
and I think everything else.  See TOADBIOS.DOC in SIMTEL20's MICRO:
<CPM.GENDOC>; source code for the patch on one of the SIGM volumes - sorry,
forget which one, but all is in TOADBIOS.DOCw.  I have that installed also
(and I have a VERY stuffed CBIOS, what with hard disk, implemented IOBYTE,
A0> CP/M prompt patch, etc., and it works fine for all but overlays (like
W*Star), where the overlays MUST be in the user area you're working in.
(However DUPUSR.COM works fine there to put the name/access in any user
area, but NOT the actual space/storage requirements.)  No undesirable effects
at all from the USER patch.

In order to continue a (not so) fiery discussion...

First, I didn't mean to imply anything about the "reviewer" of
the C compilers mentioned in the previous note. Once again my fingers
moved faster than the diplomacy in my head...

However...

The C/80 compiler is written in C/80 (like BDS is written in BDS C
and SMALL C is written in...). So are a text formatter similar to
U**X nroff, a LISP interpreter, and a number of other things
available from Software Toolworks. These are marketed programs so
I'd have to assume they were written by "professional" programmers.
When one compares the intrinsic functionality of C/80 and BDS C
one finds that they are remarkably similar, especially if one
considers that the libraries of stuff provided by BDS can be
obtained from simtel20 (among other places). Once more I'd like
to mention that C/80 performed "better" in execution benchmarks by a
number of independent testers (if this means anything).

The C/80 2.0 compiler is a C compiler well suited for "professional"
purposes. I understand that Version 3.0 has more of the standard
features that one expects from a "professional"s tool. At the price
being asked, THIS reviewer considers it to be not only inexpensive, 
but one of the better C compilers available on the market, and,
widespread use of BDS not withstanding, "better" in many important
ways than said compiler.

Typed from the keyboard of a multi-year "professional" computer scientist,

Russ <Smith@nrl-aic>

P.S.
Sorry about that folks, but the 'at least "professional" programmers'
aside in JB's previous note got my scruff up...

Unless BDS C was completely rewritten lately (which I strongly doubt!)
it is NOT written in itself, other than the upper level I/O library
functions.  BDS C is written in assembler -- that's why it's so
blindingly fast.  When I used to work with CP/M a lot, I found that
fast compilation and loading was more important to me than many
other language features -- I just didn't have time to sit around waiting
for long compiles/assemblies on a single-process machine.  

BDS C is exceptionally fast to compile and load and is an excellent
product.

BDS C IS an excellent product. C/80 IS ALSO an excellent product.
BDS C costs $150. C/80 costs $50. That's all I implied by my messages.
If one is starting out with the hopes of achieving success (but not yet
having reached that point) one doesn't necessarily have the extra bucks
to spend. I added C/80 to JB's list because it is a relatively inexpensive
way to get yourself programming in C with the resulting programs doing
quite well in benchmark tests in comparison to the full range of C
compilers available for 8080 (z80) based machines. Nothing in my messages
should be taken as knocking BDS C. Too many extremely useful things have
been written and compiled by this compiler to do so. 

Yours quite sincerely,

great deal, but I need to know about the details of the system, such as:

o Are versions of ZCPR2 and MODEM7 available for it.

o Is it compatible with CP/M stuff in general. 

o What kind of terminal does it pretend to be? Are there emulation
programs for it.

o It claims to run Extended CP/M 2.2, I suppose to take advantage of
the banked memory. Any screws with this?

o How reliable is it.

o We don't get serial boards with it, and maybe no BIOS. How easy
is it to find a copy of the BIOS.

Subject: Filename attributes in lowercase - a proposal
From: bridger@Rand-Unix.ARPA

On terminals that don't have highlighting, it's not easy to determine
a file's attributes.  I propose a simple, portable convention for
use in file utilities, telecommunications and applications programs:

If an attribute bit is set, display the corresponding character in the
filename in lower case.  Thus,

	STAT.coM        would be Read/Only, SYStem
	mAC.COM         would mean bit 1 is set

This isn't perfect -- a short filename or filetype won't always have
its attributes displayed.  But it could
readily be incorporated into the next revisions of MDM7, SD, XDIR, NSWP,...

Subject:  Re:  SID Write command?

SID/ZSID by themselves do not support a Write/Save command, but in
conjunction with the utility RELS.UTL (or REL.UTL) they do.  The utility
provides a number of additional commands which may be executed from within
SID/ZSID, and one such command is C.SAVE, which is used as follows:

	ZSID A.RELS.UTL
	Imyfile.hex
	R		<-- Read in file from disk
	Imyfile.com	<-- Define Name of output file
	C.SAVE 100 endadr	<-- Write data to disk from 100H to endadr
	G0		<-- done

The ZEX.ZEX command file gives a graphic example of the use of RELS.UTL
with some explanation.  I'll see if I can look up some documentation on

In-reply-to: Your message of Tuesday, 10 Apr 1984 12:26-PST.
From: kevinw@isl

there is a write command for sid 3.0 (the one which comes standard with
the distribution disk).  the documentation for it is in one of the refs
but not the other (typical dri...).

anyway, if you have a cpm3 system the command is:
Wfile[,start,stop]
`file' is a standard cpm file description -- eg q:foo.baz
`start' and `stop' are optional start and stop addresses.  if none
are specified then the start of the tpa is used as start and the
address of the LAST end of load address is used.  this is a nasty bug!
e.g.

A>sid foo.com
SID 3.0...
NEXT LAST HIGH PC <or some such>
0C00 0C00 CDFF 0100

#rbar.com
NEXT LAST HIGH PC
0300 0C00 CDFF 0100

#wquux.com
Saved 4 records (4h) <or some such>

n.b. -- one would have expected 11 records but someone at dri
screwed up this.  thus to get what would be expected, one must
say

#wquux.com,100,c00
Saved 11 records (0bh)

I did not find RELS.UTL or REL.UTL (there are two different files)
in the main CP/M archives on SIMTEL20.

In scanning the SIG/M catalog, I note the following references:

	REL.UTL in Vol 76

I can find no other documentation on REL.UTL or RELS.UTL.  Perhaps someone
else knows of the source for details?

Allan,
	A friend of mine recently had the same problem. (At least it sounds
like it) 

	Almost any modem program with a text capture mode will collect the
ascii data and allow storage to a CP/M file. However, the model 100
fails to transmit linefeeds. Thus, a file of this construct, lists
continually on one line. On, the other hand if you use Wordstar to view
the file, you will be able to see it all. To convert the file to useable
CP/M format is pretty simple. All that's required is a program to open
the text file and create a second file, then read a line from the
existing file and write it to the new file, finally close the files when
it's done. 

	CP/M (at least that on the 820) will see the carriage return as the end
of the line when reading and append the line feed when writing. I've
used this method in MBASIC and C without any problems. If you need a
source file let me know and I'll send one.

This is the updated version of my older list of the C compilers for
CP/M 80. For the people who have been observing my discussion with
Russ Smith, you should note that Russ Smith and I do agree on C/80
and BDS C issue (even though it may not be obvious from our messages).

There are several C's available for CP/M80. The prices quoted are
the list prices, and most/all of the compilers can be purchased at
a discount.
1 - BDS C: Great to learn C with. Very fast compiler,
    respectable execution speed, source code of the libraries
    and a well supported user's group. But it is not a full
    implementation of C (lacks longs, floats, statics, and
    initializers). $150.
    
2 - MANX AZTEC CII: Very good compiler (I use it for 
    production work), full implementation, you get the source
    of the libraries, assembler output of the compiler can be
    further hand optimized, an 8086 and 6502 and PDP-11 
    versions are available. Fast execution speed, but 
    compilation speed can be improoved usin a hard disk or
    a ram disk. $199.
    
3 - Whitesmith's C: Don't touch it if you don't have to. 
    Incredibly slow compilation times, and their libraries
    do not resemble the other ones that I know. $600???

4 - Echo C: For Z-80 only. Heard good things, but never seen
    it.

5 - Supersoft C:I'd rather have Aztec C. Slower compilation
    times, not a full implementation (the version I have),
    and pain in the neck to develop software with (terrible
    linking problems -too much code gets included-).

6 - C/80: A subset of C with respectable execution speed,
    (apparently faster than BDS C), for only $50. I think it
    produces assembler output. People interested in this compiler
    should also look at 'Small C', which also includes the source
    of the compiler (written in C).


Please feel free to send me info on this list, so next person who
needs advice on C compilers gets an updated list.

(And if you aren't hacking in BASIC and CP/M any more -- purge this thing!)

How often have you wished you could find an easy way to switch your
BASIC to direct PRINT statements to the printer or the console as
you or the user desires, without the typical

IF HARDCOPY THEN LPRINT "FOOBAR" ELSE PRINT "FOOBAR"

This sure can get tiresome - I have some programs that permit the user
to elect screen display and/or printer display, and perhaps 1/3
of the code is that sort of redundancy!

The one-page article in "Programmer's Guide to CP/M" (Creative
Computing Press, Morris Plains NJ, 1982), entitled "Choosing Between
CRT & Printer Output" gave me hope, but the bloody Sample Program
just wouldn't work!

I suspect some problems with the POKEing and PEEKing being limited to
one byte and returning an integer between -32768 and +32768.  I KNOW
the BASIC-80 manual says the Extended and Disk versions permit POKEing
and PEEKing integers in the range 0 to 65536, but damned if mine will!
Try POKEing a large value (like 60000 or so) anywhere, and then PEEK at
the same place (if you get that far), and you'll see what I mean.

The following little piece of code can be patched into your BASIC
programs.  It'll find YOUR Console Out and List Out jumps in your
BIOS jump table (using the BIOS jump table location found at 0001 and
0002 of CP/M), and will plug them in to the appropriate place in BASIC.

I got this idea from CPM-PERT.BAS, out at SIMTEL20's Public Domain
library in MICRO:<CPM.BASIC>.  Unfortunately the location of the Call
to Console Out for Microsoft BASIC-80 Version 5.21 is different from my
Version 5.1.  However both values are given below.

If it doesn't work, use DDT's T(race) utility to track through your
MBASIC as it initializes its BIOS calls.  It takes about 50 or so steps,
but eventually you'll see a series of moving bytes from high memory (in
my system the EA00h area) into D and E , XCHGing them, and SPHLing them
to a serious of locations in the 4100h area.  The LAST one of this series
of very similar storage moves will be the storing of LIST (list device out),
and the NEXT to last one will be the CONOUT (console out) jump.  Watch
where BASIC stores that BIOS CONOUT location -- that's the location of
BASIC's CONOUT call.  (Sorry - a little hard to explain DDT's T(race)
function; you gotta see it to believe it!)  Never had much use for the T
function, but found it handy this time.

If you know the location of your BIOS jump table's jumps to CONOUT and
LIST, that alone won't be enough.  BASIC doesn't use the location of
the JMP in the BIOS jump table itself, but the address of that JMP!
Saves one JMP, but kind of tricky unless you know what to expect!
I didn't mess with that with my PEEKs and POKEs - just used the actual
JMP in the jump table itself.

Have fun - hope this works OK for you.  It sure is saving me a lot of
redundant BASIC code, and the sheer bloody elegance of BASIC looking
at CP/M, and then poking itself a new belly button really tickles me!

I recently prepared a guide to the RS-232 signals for competent,
unknowledgeable users.  It amazed and amused me, so I thought
some of you might like to see it.  The little notes "CONNECT" and
"LEAVE OPEN" are for people constructing a cable to be used with
an asynchronous modem.

So, for the edification of the ignorant and the amusement of the
knowledgeable, I present:


   RANDOLPH FRITZ'S GUIDE TO RS-232 SIGNALS AND OTHER SICK JOKES.

Signal	DTE <-> DCE	Description
======	===========	===========

1 FG	    <-> 	Frame ground.  Sometimes connected to equipment
			chassis.  Where possible LEAVE OPEN.

2 TD		->	Transmitted data.  Data from computer (terminal) to
			modem.  CONNECT.

3 RD	<-		Received data.  Data from modem to computer
			(terminal).  CONNECT.

4 RTS		->	Request to send.  Turns on modem's transmit
			carrier.  CONNECT.

5 CTS	<-		Clear to send.  Indicates that modem's transmit
			carrier is on.  Some modems assert this all the
			time.  CONNECT.

6 DSR	<-		Data set ready.  Indicates that modem is on.
			Some modems assert this even when they're off.
			CONNECT.

7 SG	  <->		Signal ground.  Voltages of all other signals are
			referenced to this.  CONNECT.

8 DCD	<-		Data carrier detect.  Asserted when the modem
			hears a carrier.  Some modems assert this all the
			time, still others assert this in response to any
			received signal.  CONNECT.

9 	<-		In some Bell modems, +12V to power test equipment.
			If connected, can create smoke.  LEAVE OPEN.

10	<-		In some Bell modems, -12V to power test equipment.
			If connected, can create smoke.  LEAVE OPEN.

11 QM	<-		Equalizer mode.  Not RS-232.  Bell 208A 4800 bps
			modems only.  LEAVE OPEN.

12 HS	<-		High speed.  Not RS-232.  Hayes Smartmodem 1200
			only.  Asserted when 1200 bps connection
			established.  Mainly of use to auto-answer modem.
			LEAVE OPEN.

   or

12 SDCD <-		Secondary data carrier detect.  Used by only modems
			with a secondary channel.  LEAVE OPEN.

13 SCTS <-		Secondary clear to send.  Asserted when secondary
			transmit carrier is on.  LEAVE OPEN.

14 STD	<-		Secondary transmitted data.  LEAVE OPEN.

   or

14 NS		->	New sync.  Not RS-232.  Bell 208A 4800 bps
			modems only.  LEAVE OPEN.

15 TC	<-		Transmit clock.  Synchronous modems only.  LEAVE
			OPEN.

16 SRD	<-		Secondary received data.  LEAVE OPEN.

   or

16 DCT	<-		Divided clock, transmitter.  Not RS-232.  Bell
			208A 4800 bps modems only.  LEAVE OPEN.

17 RC	<-		Receive clock.  Synchronous modems only.  LEAVE
			OPEN.

18 DCR	<-		Divided clock, receiver.  Not RS-232.  Bell 208A
			4800 bps modems only.  LEAVE OPEN.

19 SRTS		->	Secondary request to send.  Turns on secondary
			carrier.  LEAVE OPEN.

20 DTR		->	Data terminal ready.  Asserted by computer (or
			terminal) when ready to use the modem.  RS-232
			specifies that all other signals from computer are
			meaningless when this is not asserted.  Most
			modems will not answer telephone when this is not
			asserted.  CONNECT.

21 SQ	<-		Signal quality.  Asserted by some fancy modems
			when line noise rises.  LEAVE OPEN.

22 RI	<-		Ring indicator.  The electrical equivalent of the
			telephone bell on an auto-answer modem.  The
			proper way to auto-answer is: wait for RI.  On
			second ring DTE should assert DTR.  The modem will
			then answer.  LEAVE OPEN.

23 HS		->	High speed.  Make a connection in high speed mode,
			if possible.  Used (if at all) by originate modem.
			LEAVE OPEN.

   or

23 HS	<-		High speed.  A connection has been made in high
			speed mode.  Used (if at all) by answer modem.
			LEAVE OPEN.

24 (TC)		->	Transmit clock from computer.  Unusual.  LEAVE
			OPEN.

25		->	Busy.  The line is busy.  Used (if at all) by
			auto-originate modem.  LEAVE OPEN.

Randolph - I enjoyed the guide to RS-232 connections.  I wonder, however, why
you gave such a nice description of the use of Ring Indicator, and then said
to LEAVE IT OPEN.  Huh?  Also, I'd like to know how a modem can assert ANY
RS-232 signal when it is off.  It seems that the plus-and-minus three volts
"forbidden zone" in the standard would make it impossible for signals to be
asserted when the modem is off (unless the modem contains a battery).  Or did
you decide to slip April Fools Day to the fourth?

[ copyright (c) 1984 Ronald G. Fowler ]

There has been some controversy lately regarding the distribution of
public domain software with respect to the copyright law.  I've done
some preliminary research, and thought I'd share my findings with
the group.

Specifically in question has been Irv Hoff's copyright of his MDM
modem series, especially as it relates to Ward Christensen's orig-
inal work and Mark Zeiger's extensive enhancements to the program.
Prevention of "profit-taking" and sale of public-domain software
has also been discussed.

Fundamental to securing copyright protecton is the publication of a 
work; generally you may copyright unpublished work without restrict-
ion (i.e., you don't have to maintain a copyright notice in the work).
Legally, 'publishing' is the "distribution of copies ... to the pub-
lic, by sale or other transfer of ownership, or by rental, lease or
lending".  I think we can safely say that work distributed by SIG/M
and the CPMUG can be deemed legally "published".

Both the old (1909) copyright law and the new (1978) require a that
a copyright notice be placed in the work, in order to secure the copy-
ight.  While the newer law addresses procedures for omission of this
notice (in order that a mistaken omission not cause loss of copyright
protection) the older law did not. Work published prior to 1 January,
1978 falls under the jurisdiction of the older law.  In fact, Copyright
Office Circular "R1" specifically mentions this circumstance:

	"If a work was published under the copyright owner's 
	authority before January 1, 1978, without a proper
	copyright notice, all copyright protection for that
	work was permanently lost in the United States.  The
	new copyright law does not provide retroactive pro-
	tection for those works."

Now MODEM2 was published by CPMUG, without copyright notice, in
1977.  So much for any claim poor Ward might have.

MODEM2 is therefore unquestionably in the public domain.

(Note that the terms "copyright" and "public domain" are mutually
exclusive, under the law.  "Public domain" is work without copyright,
either by expiration of an existing copyright, or by forfeiture of
copyright by the author.  Hence, a disclaimer like "Copyright (c)
1984 by Calvin C. Codehacker: contributed to the public domain, may
not be sold commercially" is a contradiction in terms, and may very
well jeopardize the author's right to copyright.  For that reason,
I *never* refer to the "public domain" in any programs I introduce
to the user community for which I desire to retain copyright pro-
tection).

(Side note: there is absolutely *nothing* to prevent a commercial in-
terest from selling public domain work, legally or ethically.  Have
you ever seen an anthology of Edgar Allen Poe, or a recently reprinted
"Moby Dick", both of which have fallen into the public domain?  Has
sale of these caused any kind of public outcry of "ripoff!"?  Think
about it...)

Back to MODEM2 and MODEM7: Zeiger and Hoff's enhancements have been
published (SIG/M, I believe) after 1 January, 1978, and thus fall under
the jusrisdiction of the 1978 law, which provides for "derivative work".
A "derivative work" is "a work based on one or more preexisting works".
This seems to be subject to copyrights held by the author of the
previous work, but is not spelled out specifically in the material
I've seen so far.  I'd hazard to guess that Hoff and Zeiger are on
pretty stable ground, though, *unless* either has failed to actually
secure the copyright by registration.  That's where things begin to
get a little shaky.

Generally, you don't have to register to claim copyright; you can reg-
ister anytime within five years of publication and still establish
prima facie evidence in court of the copyright's validatity. There
is a "gotcha" though: if the work is not registered within 3 months
after publication, then no statutory damages or attorney's fees are
available to the plaintiff in an infringement suit.  In this case,
only actual damages and lost profits are available, and in "free"
distribution software, there are very little damages indeed (perhaps
if the author is a professional who receives value from the circulation
of his name in "free" software, the loss of that circulation could
constitute a damage....).

Now I think we have a clear idea of how to proceed with new "freeware":

1) Claim copyright in the published work (copyright circular "R61"
   suggests placing the notice in the program's sign-on message,
   if it has one. By the way, this pub is specific to computer software).

2) Do not fail to actually register the copyright with the Copyright
   office, within 3 month of publication.  

3) Never mention the public domain in relation to your work.

With these requirements met, the software is protected to the extent
that you can confidently proceed legally against infringers, including
attorney's fees and statutory damages. Merely by virtue of your author-
ship (and, of course, your copyright).

---------

Interesting aside: if you publish work with the Copyright notice
included, you *must* deposit a copy with the Copyright office for the
use of the Library of Congress; failure to do so can result in fines
and other penalties.  (Note that there are certain exceptions and
modifications to this rule for various types of copyright works).

Also: Forms are available from the U.S. Government Copyright Office:
dial (202) 287-9100.  Ask for form TX and Circulars R1 and R61.  The
cheapskates will only send you five TX's for one phone call.

Message-ID:  <840412153447.123567@MIT-MULTICS.ARPA>

Some things, especially misbehaving file transfer programs, can succeed
in creating objects with mixed-case, or lower-case, objects in the CP/M
file system.  The resulting objects are very hard to identify (since
much software tries to automatically upper-case the names), and even
harder to get rid of (since the CP/M resident commands all map whatever
is typed to upper case before trying to erase, rename, or whatever).

So, if you use a case-shift to show status, you will need both
 - a way to indicate when the lower case character is lower case because
it is there and/or
 - a way to caution the reader that the name really contains lower case.
  Those requirements might lead to the reinvention of highlighting.

  Now, you could probably safely ignore this for some programs (such as
MDM7), but it is probably quite important that things like SD and XDIR
tell what is really there, so, without precisely what you are trying to
avoid, it does not make a good general convention -- I want
directory-inspecting programs to tell me what is in the directory as
their absolute first priority.

I am surprised that the UNIX community has not noticed this little
problem arising occasionally as well (if, indeed, they have not).

Unfortunately, not having a hard disk, I failed to note

As two examples, and for general interest, there is the Atari
SuperBreakout cartridge that displayed the programmers initials when the
right combination of keys was pressed.  And, I have heard the
(unconfirmed) rumor that the MacIntosh operating system is set up so
that once every large number of times you will boot the operating system
and not get the system.  You'll get a picture of a monkey waving at you.
The next boot will work fine.

Anyone have any other examples?

PLEASE copy me directly on any replies, since I don't read all of the

Donno about the neat cheap commercial version, but the Public Domain one
out at SIMTEL20 (MICRO:<ARCHIVE> works just fine.  Needs one wee little
BDOS (I think) patch, and the only undesirable side effect is that my
D.COM program (another directory program that lists alphabetically, file
size, remaining, etc.) doesn't wildcard properly; however SDIR.COM is fine).

Price is right too!

The "one wee little" BDOS patch used by one of those programs goes
into the disk directory checksum bytes beginning with drive E so you
might want to be careful using it.

BTW, the "archiving" program I wrote uses the T3 bit but does not
alter the BDOS.  I know this is broken for random access files but
big deal, we don't use any.  Could there be something else I didn't
think of?

Someone complained that Aztec C creates a large COM file (compared to what???).
Keep the code below in seperate file, and include it when linking your modules
(order doesn't matter, but before libc.lib). I call this file minroot.c and
minroot.o for source and relocatible versions respectively.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Croot()
{
    exit(main());
}

exit(code)
{
    boot@();  /* @ sdands for underline character. These keyboards!!! */ 
}

badfd()
{
    return -1;
}

noper()
{
    return 0;
}
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The result of the program  "main() { }" (which shows size of the runtime
package) is:
  with minroot.o = 7 sectors --> 896 bytes
  without        =36 sectors -->4608 bytes
  
  But if you use the buffered I/O library (printf does!), then the necesseary
  code gets linked in and the size of the COM file is the same as before.

I have Manx's Aztec C II compiler and am very happy with it.
It's full K&R C with only two exceptions: no enumerations
and no bit fields.  Unfortunately, it is a bit pricey at
$200.  I have had very good luck with developing programs
on the Z80 for the VAX and vice versa.

To: info-cpm@Brl-Aos.ARPA

I tried copying R/O files with NSWP2.04.  Tried both the  'C' mode and
the 'M' mode after 'tagging'.  In both cases it worked fine -- no
bug apparent.  While I doubt that it makes any difference, I have
set the vales at the beginning of the program that highlight the
bits in the directory name that are set by R/O, SYS, or what have you.
(Correct 'vales' 2 lines above to read 'values').

I'm running standard CPM2.2 with ZCPR2.

FYI.

Subject:  more on nswp204 $r/o bug

I've found out some more in the nswp204 bug that causes it not to be able to 
copy $r/o files - somehow it's involved with the inverse video patches.  If I 
don't patch in the inverse videos, everything runs fine.

The two patches are: Inverse video on at 0104 (number of characters, then the 
characters) and Inverse video off at 010B.  For my televideo this corresponds 
to 104=2, 105=1b, 106=29, 10B=2, 10C=1B, and 10D=28.  I have no idea why this 
affects the copy.  It worked fine in version 2.00.

Regarding the P.S., on my last message, I have found other minor problems but 
not significant to bother the list with.  But since several people asked:

1.  The sequence of logging into the B: drive, switching disks in the A: drive 
and then attempting to copy a file from the logged in B: drive to A: fails in 
the disk $R/O error.  The copy will work if one first asks for remaining space 
on A: before the copy or copying from A: to B:.

2.  If one copies a single file from the A: drive to the B: drive, switches 
disks in the B: drive, and then tries to copy the same file to the new B: 
disk, a disk $R/O error results.  One has to again "log" in the new B: disk by 
asking for the remaining space on B: before copying.

3.  When the destination disk for a copy fills up and NSWP attempts to delete 
the partial copy and the file being copied was $R/O, a file $R/O error bombs 
the program because the $R/O attribute has also been copied.  In this 
condition the $R/O flag has to be taken off first before deleting the partial 
copy.

4.  When unsqueezing files squeezed with the orginal sq-17 (version maybe 
wrong) the filename of the unsqueezed file was in lower case and had to be 
renamed to uppercase.  This might not be worth "fixing" as the problem is 
probably in the old sq-17 squeezer. (I usually type all my comands in 
lowercase and I probably lowercased the command line at the time of the 
original squeeze.)

I than had 14 or so suggestions to make it "better" which I sent indirectly to 
Dave Rand.  (Add a LU utility, add the pip options, add bishow features, etc.)  
More than Dave would be willing to add in any case.  But then I never fully 
satisfied with anything - especially software, included the programs I write!

All you HAM CP/Mers out there...

I recently purchased a Kantronics UTU (Universal Terminal Unit) and 
interfaced it with my KayPro II. I planned to use it for RTTY/ASCII and
AMTOR with MDM730 as my terminal program. I'm using an Icom IC-720A as
the tranceiver.

The UTU receives like a dream! I've spent all weekend listening to folks
check into HF Bulletin Board Systems, and generally listening around 40
meters. Tonight, the big test...I called up a local ham and attempted to
put the thing on the air.

When I started transmitting, I ran into all kind of trouble. My echoed
characters were strange, the system would "warm boot," and I couldn't
get the tranceiver out of transmit mode.

My first thoughts center around some type of RF overload of the KayPro.
My tranceiver is well grounded, but I'm loading a long-wire which could
be putting RF in my shack. Anyway, I'm going to experiment with VHF
since there shouldn't be so much RF banging around.

Anyone with similar experiences? Hints?

Apologies in advance for sending this to what is probably the wrong
list. Responses to me to keep down the non-CP/M static.

Before anyone starts cutting traces on their boards it should be noted
that the 820 used a TTL monitor ie. seperate HS,VS,and VIDEO. If you do
a bit of reading you will find that TTL monitors have no horizontal 
oscillator and require a 25-30 microsecond HS pulse to sync them while
COMPOSITE monitors, having their own oscillator, require only a 5-8 micro-
second HS pulse to trigger the oscillator. If you use a circuit to combine
the sync and video signals to drive a composite monitor you should indeed
use the shorter HS signal. This does not require any trace cuts since there
are unused pins on J7 and an unused IC position on the board next to U34.
I used that IC position for my combiner circuit and brought out the composite
signal to an unused pin on J7. This gives both TTL AND COMPOSITE video output
so you can use either type of monitor. I prefer the TTL type since it has a
greater bandwith thereby giving a sharper display. The circuit I used appeared
in the Oct. 6, 1982 Electronics Magazine page 113.

Subject: 8086 co-processors for CPM80
To: info-cpm@Amsaa.ARPA
Cc: treid@Mitre.ARPA

I am considering adding an 8086 co-processor to my CPM80 system
(Ithaca 525; Z80B, 128K, 2-5 1/4" and 2-8" drives).  HSC, Herkimer,
NY (see add in April '84 Microsystems, p. 16) has one.  Their latest
brochure lists an 8086 processor board with 256K ram, MS-DOS 2.11,
8 bit ram disk, Z80 interface, documentation, enclosure, and power
supply for $775 retail.  Other options such as 68000, CPM86, and a
(SOON) IBM compatible bus are available.

The system boots up as (1) of old, (2) CPM80 with a 256K ram
disk, or (3) MSDOS/CPM86 using the CPM80 for all non-ram I/O.
Sounds like a way to get both a ram disk and a 16 bit processor
without throwing the old system away if . . .

I would be interested in hearing from anyone who has experience
with this or other co-processors.  In particular, what are the
bonuses, problems, or gotchas.  For example, could the Z80 being a
ribbon cable away from its old CPU slot cause problems or is the
8086-back-to-CPM80-for-I/O going to be too slow?  The people at HSC
say that the system can be installed in 15 minutes.

I will edit and keep updated any responses to those interested via
the net.  Thanks.  Tom Reid at MITRE Corp., McLean, Va.

ps - I am interested in buying an Ithaca 64K ram board.

Here is a reply from Dave Rand, re the bug reports you sent.  He has
just released NSWP205 which is now on SIMTEL20 in the
MICRO:<CPM.FILCPY> directory.  The files are NSWP205.COM, .HEX and
.DOC (a short file explaining the changes in NSWP204 and 205).
NSWP2.DOC or .DQC remains current.

Bob,

   Got your sugggestions/bug reports... Here is a short reply..

1.  With regard to R/O on (C)opy command - This is correct. I had originally
    put in the disk reset, and then took it out. Reason - Takes TOO LONG! on
    floppy based systems, especially when you want to copy more than one
    file. If enough people beat me hard enough, I will put it back in.

2.  As of version 2.04, USQ should change the case of SQ'ed files back to
    upper.

3.  I will take care of the R/O on delete after mass on next revision. Look
    for NSWP206 after the end of the month.

Now on to the suggestions...

1.  NSWP will never, ever have any LBR features. Jim Lopushinsky has released
    a utility that works BOTH on ARChives and on LBRs, and he does it SO much
    better than I could have. His utility, called LBRDISK, makes a virtual
    drive out of a LBR/ARC file, thus creating subdirectories, with no
    limit other than RAM. Neat stuff, and I highly recommend it!

2.  BISHOW has its place, and I don't think it would be worth it to put
    it inside NSWP (which would increase the size by at least 1K).

3.  COPY does have the V option for verify already. I have considered adding
    some other PIP functions, but high on my list is file concatanation.
    I will try to add those functions Real Soon Now.

4.  Boy! Do you think of these at night?  Need a survey on this one. A lot
    of people pressured me into KEEPING the original tags, including R/O.
    This will add about .1-.2K to the file.

5.  CRC on tagged files... Hmmm... what a concept! Since I have CRC code in
    already.... tag this one with Real Soon Now.

6.  DU: form on entry... look for it in NSWP206.

7.  This one, no. I HATE worrying about status of files. If destination is
    R/O, and you are copying over it, you REALLY want to. Same for rename.
    Delete is the only case that you SHOULD be warned, because you might
    NOT know that the file is R/O (but with Rev. Video tags now....)

8.  A*:*.QQZ - I like it... Look for this one in 206 or 207.

9.  Exception masks are ok... Look for !*.COM wildcard first, then maybe
    on login as well - 207 or 208.

10. Ok, on this one, a definate maybe. I sorta like the idea of single file
    tags, but... what can I say. That changes the basic commands, and I
    DON'T like that. Consistant, these commands aren't. But they are
    standard.

11. Vfiler output - I am getting a LOT of heat on this one. I will try
    Real Soon Now to get that started. Look around 210 or so.

12. Disk resets - Even Big Systems have a floppy or two. BUT, I will be
    looking real hard at the DPB's and see if there is enough information
    to decide if I can pick out devices that need resetting when you try to
    access them. CPM3 is my big block, on this one.

13. Sorry - This one, no can do. I can't keep device independent enough to
    run on 2.2, 3.0 and mpm, to say nothing of Turbodos...

14. You missed one. If you tag/squeeze a file to the same drive/user group
    you have specified, the new file DOES NOT show up in the directory list
    until the next LOG. I tried, briefly, in NSWP203 to auto-log after a
    mass sq/usq, but... of course you loose all tags. No one was happy.
    I can't show file space until after I do a directory scan, and I can't
    do a directory scan... you get the idea. I will work on it, though.



Thank you for your suggestions, and I will implement them ASAP. A lot
of my free time has been taken up with NSWP86, which is now done.

If you note my comments on LBR - you will find I don't like LBRs very much.
ARS were my first love, and still are. LBR has a ways to go in terms of
utilities and flexibilty to catch up to the ARC series. Do check out
Jim's utility though, since it works very well, and fast to boot!


Following is a yet still unsolved question on NSWP:

A few days ago, I had a call from a mildly irate user of NSWP2. He claimed
that NSWP failed on the 'X' command, and proceeded to tell me why. I can
find no reason behind his logic, so here it is... if someone has an
idea, PLEASE let me know!

In NSWP, I don't jump to zero when I exit. Instead, I do what amounts to a
return to the CCP. The actual code involved goes like this...

	XTHL		;get contents of (SP) into HL
	SHLD CCPRET+1	;save it as part of a JMP instruction
	LXI  SP,STACK	;and move stack local

later on, when I want to return to CP/M, I use:

CCPRET:	JMP 0000h	;to be filled in

The users' system was a heavily modified CPM 2.2 system, that included
bank selected memory. He says, however, that had I have done things
'correctly', I should have used the following code:

	lxi h,0		;offset zero
	dad sp		;from stack pointer
	shld CCPSTK+1	;and save old stack address
	LXI  SP,STACK	;and move stack local

and to return to the CCP:

CCPSTK:	lxi SP,0	;to be filled in
	ret		;get back!

Now... You know, and I know, that JMPing to the address on the top of the
stack is EXACTLY the same as RET'ing, except that I don't preserve the stack.
But DR's CCP, along with all CCP replacements, ALWAYS use the code:

	CALL	100h	;execute transient program
	LXI	SP,LOCS	;restore stack, in case we get back.

except for CPM 3.0, which uses

	LXI	H,0	;return address of warm boot!
	push	h
	jmp	100h	;execute transient

What I think, is that his CCP (which has been modified by him), DOES NOT
do the LXI SP. However, I am open to suggestions. By the way, he is the
ONLY user (from the 50 or so that have contacted me) that has reported this
problem.

I am mystified. He claims that the LXI SP is there. If that is the case
(which I don't believe), magic must be occuring. If anyone can explain
to me the difference between the JMP and the RET, I would forever be in
your debt!

Thanks in advance... Dave Rand

There will be a live demonstration of ZCPR3 this week for those who
are interested.

The demo runs from 6PM EST to 8AM the following day on Monday-Friday
of this week, starting April 16.  The Friday demo ends at 8AM Sat
morning.

To try out ZCPR3, do the following:

	Using your home computer  or terminal as a terminal (full duplex),
set your modem and computer/terminal speed to 300 baud.  Then dial into
201-544-1830 and strike the RETURN key if it does not start up immediately.

	The system will ask you for an access code.  Type the word DEMO
(upper or lower case).  It will then want a password - type DEMO also.

	If all goes well, you are in.  A menu will appear, and you can type
the indicated keys to perform the indicated functions.  You will also be
allowed to go to the ZCPR3 command level if you wish.  

	Several demos have been prepared, and they will be extended with
even more info beginning with the Wed evening demo.  The demos run approx
15-30 mins total, depending upon what you want to do.  Enjoy!

DUU and DU2 (with more features) are indeed excellent disk editors.
There is however one slight problem when dealing with disks with bad
sectors.  My BIOS and I assume most BIOS' trap errors and will not
return the data to DUU or DU2 if one is detected.  This leaves the
contents of the previous read in DUU's buffer.  I wrote quick and
dirty DDT routines to turn off error detection while attemting to
repair bad sectors  and then reenable error detection when I'm done.

NEVER!  "That's NEVER EVER try fixing a bad track by doing:
read..  write.. increment.. loop.    Fix those nasty little sectors
one at a time "manually".  I completeletely destroyed a directory by
doing the afforementioned "never ever".

The error handling/reporting by those programs "should" abort loops and
return error messages to the user.

DUU and DU are at SIMTEL20 via anonymous FTP (I think DUU is in the SIGM
files somewhere, and DU under disk utilities).  FINDBAD, which is supposed to
find and lock out bad sectors (by storing them in a file called BAD or
something like that) is also out there -- however I find it does not catch
all the errors, since I can run FINDBAD and still get BDOS errors. Donno
why.

If you need help FTPing from SIMTEL20, yell.

There are two major CPM libraries; CPMUG and SIG/M. Of the two, SIG/M is now
the most active and all the new stuff is released in it.

Here is a list of disk manipulators you may be interested in:

DUU.*      CPMUG VOL 78
DU2.ASM    SIG/M VOL 108
DU2.COM    SIG/M VOL 108
DU2.HLP    SIG/M VOL 103   DU2.COM IS SELF DOCUMENTING AND REALLY NEEDS NO HELP
VFILER     SIG/M VOL 145
VERIFY.C   SIG/M VOL ?
Z80DISK    SIG/M VOL 140
DISK7      SIG/M VOL 127
FINDBAD    SIG/M VOL 86
CATALOG    SIG/M VOL 0   THIS DISK HAS A LIST OF ALL AVAILABLE CP/M SOFTWARE

If you don't have access to a user's group you can either send me a disk in a
SASE or you can call me at (612) 920-2115.  I have a modem at home running
MDM724 and could transfer the files to you if you like.

I have everything above but Z80DISK and DISK7.

Send me a message and let me know what you would like to do.

Have a fine day.      Jesse (Eaton.HFED@hi-multics) in Mpls, Mn.

P.S. My work number is (612) 830-3682.      Bye.........

Art,

(Netland, I'll help him so don't deluge the fellow!)

<CPM.WSTAR> is an entire directory, with lots of files (some of which NOT so
very small!)  Do you want the WHOLE THING?  Do you want just the directory
listing for CPM.WSTAR so you can pick and choose?  Glad to help either route,
but if you want it ALL, we might have to do this bits and pieces.

Can you FTP at all?  If so, you can reach out and grab it from my directory.
If not, I can send it directly via electronic mail (but will have to HEXIFY
the .COM/binary files, which will be in ITS-binary format - you'll have to
convert back if moving to a micro).

My mailer seems to be choking lately on really big files, but we can find
a way.

Regards (just respond directly to me),

Internet users note:

	CARE SHOULD BE TAKEN WHEN REPLYING TO MAIL
	RECEIVED FROM THE USENET NEWS SYSTEM.

Usenet news group "net.micro.cpm" are being feed to the INFO-CPM mail
distribution list. Long "@BERKELEY" addresses with local address
containing a large number of hosts separated by exclamation points "!"
are not necessarily valid mail addresses.  If the message came from the
USENET News system, the local address is a record of the hosts that the
news article has been distributed to before being relayed to INFO-CPM.
In some cases a news article may have gone back and forth across the
country several times before being relayed to INFO-CPM.

In the case of:
	
	To: decvax!ittvax!dcdwest!sdcsvax!bmcg!felix!zemon@BERKELEY

the

	decvax!ittvax!dcdwest!sdcsvax!bmcg!felix!zemon

is a USENET news distribution path, not a UUCP mail path. The address
	
	To: decvax!ittvax!dcdwest!sdcsvax!bmcg!felix!zemon@BERKELEY

would mail your reply via ucbvax (@Berkeley), then decvax
(on the East Coast) then to ittvax, then ittvax, then sdcsvax
(UC San Diego) which is linked to ucbvax (@Berkeley).
One of the following addresses:

	To: trwrb!felix!zemon@BERKELEY

or

	To: sdcsvax!bmcg!felix!zemon@BERKELEY

would have been more direct and cheaper for all concerned.

Please note that UUCP mail goes via dial telephone links,
sometime at very slow speeds (110, 300 baud etc.).  Thus sending
large files via UUCP can be very expensive for the relay sites
(hostids between !'s) concerned. UUCP mail is not intended for
large file transfers. There is currently 100000 character limit on
messages relayed to UUCP sites via UCBVAX ("@Berkeley").  Abuse of
UUCP mail will result in lower limits being set for mail relay from
Internet to UUCP, and/or in UUCP mail sites disconnecting from the UUCP
network because they cannot paid huge telephone bills for tranferring
other peoples mail.

It is suggested that users at UUCP sites requesting copies of public
domain software from SIMTEL20 be referred to offline sources or RCPM
systems. For example CPMUG and SIG/M volumes are available via mail
order on the East Coast from the New York Amateur Computer Club and
on the West Coast from Piconet CP/M Users Group.

Fellow netlanders,

	Concerning the latest msg about the UUCP-Arpanet connection (and with
fears of starting a long discussion in the wrong place) I got a few 
questions concerning this connection which I would like someone to answer me
(and I am sure to the net too). The first questions are purelly informative
and the latter ones are more of a "discussion" type.

1) Can arpanet people send msgs to UUCP (and I guess Usenet) sites? Say
through Berkeley? I am asking this because I have been sending msgs to
UUCP sites for more than a year (for different reasons) and never had
any response.

2) Do UUCP people enter the source routing paths manually? You will think
there is some automating software for this.

3) Will the UUCP world be ever an Internet domain? I have seen paths
like "joe@foovax.UUCP", do any mailer implements this?

The following concerns mainly arpanet people:

4) Considering the nature of the UUCP network, (no user  to user e-mail,
small throughput (which arpanet people should worry about!), no restrictions,
etc.) do you consider the UUCP-Arpanet connection usefull or of some value?
Or rewording the above, what was the purpose behind connecting the two
networks in the first place?

ok arpanauts, the ball is in your side,

SINCE I CAN RECEIVE SMALL FILES (1-8K) WITH NO PROBLEMS, I AM PRETTY SURE THAT
THE PORT ASSIGNMENTS ARE CORRECT.  EVERYTIME I TRY TO COPY ANYTHING LARGER,
THE SYSTEM FAILS.  THE GUYS WHO HELPED ME MODIFY THE PROGRAMS FOR MY COMPUTER

	Fellow netlanders,

	Concerning the latest msg about the UUCP-Arpanet connection
	(and with fears of starting a long discussion in the wrong
	place) I got a few questions concerning this connection which I
	would like someone to answer me (and I am sure to the net too).

Yes you are right, a discussion about Internet/UUCP mail connections
should be elsewhere (eg. in the USENET news group "net.mail")
Here are some answers. (Can we limit future discussion to the USENET
news group "net.micro.cpm" / Internet mail distribution group "INFO-CPM"
connection?)

	The first questions are purelly informative and the latter ones
	are more of a "discussion" type.

	1) Can arpanet people send msgs to UUCP (and I guess Usenet)
	sites? Say through Berkeley? I am asking this because I have
	been sending msgs to UUCP sites for more than a year (for
	different reasons) and never had any response.

Yes. BUT, address formats are different. UUCP addresses require
source routing, eg. host1!host2!host3!hostid!userid
You must know the correct source routing. Note that "USENET"
is not a mail network, but a news distribution system which
may or may not use UUCP connections to forward articles between
USENET news sites.  It is easy to confuse a USENET path
with a UUCP mail address. They are not necessarily the same.

	2) Do UUCP people enter the source routing paths manually?

For most UUCP people, the answer is yes.	

	You will think there is some automating software for this.

There is. However the information about UUCP mail connections is
not accurate yet.

	3) Will the UUCP world be ever an Internet domain?
	
Yes, if they meet the requirements for a top domain name.
A central UUCP name registry has been established. A nameserver is
being developed. UUCP mail connections are in the process of being
mapped.

	I have seen paths like "joe@foovax.UUCP", do any mailer
	implements this?

"user@site.UUCP" is valid in USENET article heading, but not yet
fully implimented for UUCP mail. It is of course, not yet valid
within the Internet mail world.  The unix "sendmail" program
may be configured to permit local use of the UUCP top domain name.


	The following concerns mainly arpanet people:

	4) Considering the nature of the UUCP network, (no user  to
	user e-mail, small throughput (which arpanet people should
	worry about!), no restrictions, etc.) do you consider the
	UUCP-Arpanet connection usefull or of some value?  Or rewording
	the above, what was the purpose behind connecting the two
	networks in the first place?

The USENET news/INFO-CPM connection is useful in that it provides
greater coverage for the discussion of CPM. Whether UUCP/Internet
mail should be interconnected is another issue which I do not think
should be discussed here.

Bill - I enjoyed reading your message on USENET address strings, and I was
struck with the hopelessness of the average DDN user being able to figure out
the "proper" return path unless USENET message-posters do as you have done;
namely, include the desired return path in the message BODY.  Frankly, I don't
know the best USENET path for someone to send mail to my DDN address,
"towson@amsaa".  I would be grateful if someone would tell me.  Normally, when I
reply to a message, I just issue the "answer" command to the mail program and
let it get the return path from the header of the message being answered.  You
have just shown where that can get you with respect to USENET messages.  It is
also interesting to note that when I reply to you using the "answer" command,
the return path is taken to be "wcwells%ucbopal.CC@ucb-vax", and not your
preferred path "wcwells@berkeley (or ucb-vax)".

I am pretty impressed and thinking about getting one. I would appreciate any

I make a final decision.

Subject: SD-82 Super Directory program now available

SD-81 has been replaced by SD-82, thanks to Sigi Kluger for the
update.  Here's Sigi's note describing was was fixed:

-----
04/14/84

SD-82 fixes a bug in the VCODE routines which caused files to be
suppressed (and blanks printed instead) in large directories.
Thanks to Dennis Vallianos for the patch.

Other changes include the REVIDEO fix (SD in an empty directory no
longer causes toggle-type terminals to remain in reverse video until
manually changed). Toggle-type terminals are those which use a single
character to turn reverse video on and off.
Also, in some cases the "[more]" message remained on the screen; this
is also fixed now.

If you have the DIF and SSED utilities, you only need the .DIF file.
If you don't have a VECTOR computer, don't use reverse video, or
only use horizontal display, you can wait for the next major revision - you
will not notice any difference between 81 and 82.

I tried to run DUV86 on my Z-80 MP/M II.1 system yesterday.
This version is supposed to automatically figure out what
operating system (CP/M or MP/M) it is running on, and which
release, and adapt accordingly.

When I ran it, it signed on with "MP/M version 3"!!!!
Then it misread the Disk Parameter Block, so it thought
I had 220 tracks, and 0 sectors per track!

I will try and figure out what's wrong, but I was wondering
if nyone else has seen problems yet.

Although the Thinkjet has very high single-pass quality (relatively
speaking), you cant go any higher, whereas with something like the
EPSON FX80 you can do multiple passes after moving the paper an
itsy-bitsy bit, and get higher quality.  With a program like
'Fancy font'  Truly amazing qualtiy can be achived...

Thanks to the several people who pointed out that apparently Kermit

the cpm file termination characters ^z filling out a cpm bloc.
How come Kermit doesn't seem to have a text mode & know enough to stop
sending when a ^z is encountered?

I wonder if anyone has taken some of the current, favorite PD
programs and replaced the 8080 compatible code with Z80 specific
ops to see if there is enough gain in either speed or size to
make the job worthwile. I am thinking along the lines of asking
authors if they might make Z80 assembly an option in their code, 
if, indeed it makes it worth it. I wonder what effect this would have
on such programs as MODEM (MDM,MEX), NSWP, MLOAD, SD, etc....

I haven't an 8080 anywhere. (nor an 8085).

the ^Z it the CPM end of file character for ascii files.
it is always there except when it would be the first character in
a new allocation (either new block or new extent, i don't remember)
kermit apparently does not differentiate between text (with 0x1a marking
end of file) and binary (with no end of file -- only data)

RICK,

I HAVE BEEN VERY INTERESTED IN THE KENTRONICS UNIT SINCE I SAW IT IN THE
RECENT ISSUE OF QST. IT IS STILL UNAVAILABLE HERE IN THE DALLAS AREA. I
AM IN HOPES OF BEING ABLE TO PICK UP ONE WHEN I GO TO DAYTON. SUGGEST
YOU TRY A FEW THINGS JUST TO SEE HOW THE RF (IF IT IS) GETTING INTO THE
KENTRONICS OR THE KAYPRO. TRY WRAPPING THE KENTRONICS IN ALUMINUM FOIL
AND GROUNDING IT TO YOUR STATION GROUND. GROUND LEAD SHOULD BE AS SHORT
AS POSSIBLE. ALSO BE SURE THAT YOU HAVE THE KAYPRO TIED TO YOUR STATION
GROUND WITH HEAVY BRAID. YOU SHOULD NOT DEPEND ON THE 3RD WIRE IN ANY AC
CORD FOR A GOOD RF GROUND. ALSO MAKE SURE THAT YOUR RS-232C CABLE IS
SHIELDED. IN SEVERE CASES ALTHOUGH NOT NECESSARILY WITH THE KAYPRO, I
HAVE SEEN RF "WALK" RIGHT IN ON THE SHIELD DESPITE THE FACT IT WAS
GROUNDED. THIS IS DUE TO THE SHEAR LENGTH OF THE CABLES THAT ARE USED IN
SOME OF THE COMPUTER SYSTEMS TODAY. IF THAT IS A SUSPECT YOU MIGHT TRY
TO PLACE A LARGE TORROID AROUND THE RS232 CABLE AS IT ENTERS THE KAYPRO.
I HAVE NEVER SEEN THE KENTRONICS UNIT BUT I BELIEVE THE ONLY GROUND THAT
THEY HAVE IS BY WAY OF THE RS232 CABLE. THIS IS TOO LONG OF A GROUND
PATH TO GET EFFECTIVE RF GROUNDING. YOU MIGHT EVEN TRY GROUNDING IT
BETTER AND KEEPING THE PATH AS SHORT AS POSSIBLE. PLEASE KEEP ME
INFORMED OF YOUR PROGRESS AND YOUR PERCEPTION OF THE UTU BECAUSE I PLAN
TO MARRY ONE UP WITH MY XEROX 820 ES MY YAETSU 757.

I would like to thank all the netlanders who have been kind enough to send
me copies of the C Compiler discussions.

One last favor:

		PLEASE NO NORE COPIES OF THE DISCUSSION !!!!!!!

My system administrator is getting a little disturbed with respect to the
amount of disk space my mail box is beginning to take.

Thanks again

Rick,
 What you have sounds like a classic case of RF in the shack to me, as
you surmised. A long wire type of antenna tends to exhibit such
characteristics unless you can provide a good counterpoise for it to
operate against.
 Sometimes just changing bands will give an indication of this. By that
I mean that you may observe an improvement in the situation by trying a
different (probably higher) band. Eighty and forty meters I suspect
would be the worst because an additional problem may exist. That is,
coupling of the radiated RF into the AC mains. Your house wiring may be
acting like a great receiving antenna, coupling large RF voltages into
the power supply of your Kay-Pro!
A brute force line filter may be the solution in such a case. You might
also try reducing the output power just to see if this has an effect on
performance just to verify that RF is the cause.

 I hope I have helped a little- this type of problem can be a real
s.o.b. to solve.

	73's, 	Dave Hallidy KD5RO

Subject:  Re:  HELP WITH DATA TRANSFER

Ron - I'm going to take a stab at your problem.  MDM7xx MUST have an 8-bit
data path to work.  This is because of the way the sector numbers are sent
from transmitter to receiver, and has nothing to do with the type of data
(ASCII text or binary) being sent.  I do not know what Kermit needs, or whether
you have an option of 7 or 8 bits with Kermit.  Perhaps someone else will 
comment on that.  My question, then, is, are you using an 8-bit transfer
path?  If not, I think that's your problem.

Subject: UNSPOL34 - an improved background printer spooler
Reply-To: PLK@Mit-Mc.ARPA

UNSPOOL is a program that lets you print a file while you are running
other programs.  Paul Kelley <PLK@MC> has just released version 3.4.
Here is his message detailing what's new:

-----
	The public domain unspooler by Gary Novosielski has
been updated. The following files are now available on SIMTEL20:

	MICRO:<CPM.LIST>UNSPOL34.ASM
	MICRO:<CPM.LIST>UNSPOL34.COM	;for those without MAC
	MICRO:<CPM.LIST>UNSPOL34.HEX	;for those without MAC and binary
					;	transfer capability

The following message in the file describes the update:

;3.4	84-04-17
;	Single character output to printer if either
;	BIOS or BDOS keyboard status request is made
;	by transient program. Output is conditional
;	on no keypress and printer ready after single
;	status check. Single character only to printer
;	to minimize any slowdown of transient program.
;	Program now works with MINCE. It can also be
;	used with various modem programs, however some
;	some loss of modem input may occur while the
;	text to be printed is read from disk.
;	Formfeed (page eject) added to printer output
;	at EOF. (Paul L. Kelley)
;

Additional comments -

	The reason the program did not work with MINCE or modem
programs is that the latter generally do not call the console
input function unless console status indicates a character is
waiting.

	On my system disk I/O disables interrupts so using the
UART in the interrupt mode would not prevent loss of modem input.
I find the loss to be small with 5.25" floppies and very small
with a hard disk. Since I use mostly use BABYL and EMACS on MC a
redisplay fixes things up.

	It would be nice if someone would change UNSPOOL so that
it has all the features of Rick Conn's PRINT.

	- P. L. Kelley

NetLandians,

Has anyone converted J.M. Wierda's CPMCOPY (a utility in Pascal to transfer
a CP/M file from a disk in unit 5 to a Pascal disk) to the Apple II?

His program is using 8" disk parameters, and I don't happen to have the
Apple II disk parms around handy.  (Plus I ain't so very good in Pascal yet --
not enough for high-speed patching anyway!)

Would appreciate some pointers.

Subject: Apple CP/M questions
Article-I.D.: ihu1e.223




I have a couple of questions and a comment on the AZTEC C compiler  discussion
that's been going on.

     1) I have an Apple //e with a MicroSoft  Softcard  CP/M  card  in  it.  I
thought  I  would  just  have to live with the frustration of having my screen
cleared every time CP/M did a warm boot. Then I found out that  not  all  CP/M
systems  clear  their  screen  this  way. Why does MicroSoft's? How would I go
about changing it so that I just got a message saying "warm  boot"  like  some
systems I've heard of?

     2) I use a terminal emulator called M.I.T.E. from Microft Labs.  It works
under  CP/M  and  functions  well  except that I have to set a carriage return
delay to keep from loosing characters from the beginning of lines  at  300  or
1200  baud.  I  loose  characters  when  a  line  has to wrap around (ie. > 80
characters) or whenever a Ctl-G is received in spite  of  the  CR  delay.  The
termcap  for  a  soroc terminal works (TERM=soroc) for everything else but you
can imagine what the screen looks like when I try to use vi. Microft says  the
Apple  80  column card is too slow. Is this a classic case of finger pointing?
Does anybody have a suggestion to solve this problem? Is there a  faster  card
somewhere? If so does anyone want to buy a used Apple Extended 80 Column Card?

     3) I've been using the AZTEC  C  compiler  for  over  a  year  now.  I've
transferred programs back and forth from home to work (work=VAX 11/780, 4.2bsd
or PDP 11/70, V7) and only found one problem with the AZTEC library. There  is
no  "isalpha"  in  it. Since both "islower" and "isupper" are present it's not
really a problem. I'm very impressed with it's degree of UNIX compatibility.

One thing the others didn't mention about the AZTEC compiler was the fact that
IO redirection (ie. '<' and '>') is built in to any programs compiled with it.
This is a mixed blessing as far as I can tell. A  little  bitty  program  that
just  says  "hello  world"  with  a  simple printf generates a relatively huge
.com file.  There has to be a way to get around this redirection  code  but  I
haven't figured it out. Does anyone else have a clue?

     Sorry if I got a bit verbose. I'm hoping to get  some  helpful  responses
from  this  posting  and  I  wanted to make sure all you wizards out there had
enough information to help me.

The .LBR is stored on SIMTEL20 in ITS-Binary format.  It's about 30k.

Subject:  Z3 Beta Testing

	The demonstration/test of ZCPR3 in remote access mode is now over,
and ZCPR3 has passed without a hitch.  Response has been quite positive,
with no bugs found/known at this time.  I made one very minor change to
the ZCPR3 command procesor and to SYSFCP (the IF-ELSE-FI flow command package)
to enable the "noise" associated with IF execution (which informs the user
of the state of the IF he is currently in) to be turned off, so IFs can run
without any additional text presented on the screen.

	I am finishing up the draft of the installation manual tonight,
and will send it out with ZCPR3, its system segments (RCPs, FCPs, etc), and
several of its utilities tomorrow to the Gamma test sites.  These sites
will be concerned primarily with porting ZCPR3 into different environs
based on the instruction in the installation manual.  I anticipate no
problems other than those associated with rewriting the installation manual
so it is more clear.

	Release of the ZCPR3 System is set for the end of May to SIG/M.
This is a realistic date, and I anticipate no problem in meeting it.
It will be available on SIMTEL20 shortly after its release.

I have been trying to use a CPM 1.4 system with a rather old version of

When I try to transfer a file from the local RCPM, the transfer goes
fine until #138 when it quits with a BDOS error on B.  Shorter files
work fine.  The RCPM is running the latest version of modem.  Any ideas?

 Most manufacturers find it impossible to support end-users directly.  It's
much more important to support dealers.  Therefore, CompuPro should be
**selecting and retaining** only tbhose dealers willing to support customers.
Otherwise, a company courts disaster.  If I were in CompuPro, I would drop
Priority One.  (in addition to poor support, they create problems for me
with all my dealers who support customers, but charge list price.)

    I am looking for a BIOS for CP/M 2.2 that runs on a Cromemco
System 3 and supports all of the nifty features of the 16FDC. 
Specifically Double Density and Double sidedness. Note, when I bought
the system used it came with CP/M and the SIG/M Bios that originally ran
on the 4FDC but was later updated to the 16FDC *without* adding 
DD/DS capability. I am willing to pay for it. There are limits however,
as I found when a guy at a nearby Byte Shop offered to sell me a 
Bios for $300. Lets be serious, CP/M is only $150 *list*. Of course I 
would love to find someone who has written one offer it for a nominal
fee, and if they haven't I guess I will write it myself.

George - the answer to your question is yes, you must have access to either
ARPA or MILNET to get to Simtel20.  Until recently, there were offers to 
pass specific files from SIMTEL20 to usenet folks by electronic mail, however
there have been some msgs regarding the cost of telecom for usenet 
(specifically point to point direct dial at low speeds) and the desire not
to pass large msgs (files) this way.

I have taken the liberty to cc Dave Towson on this note.  Dave is sort of the 
systems administrator for info-cpm, and I would like to address a point to
him.  
	Dave - I realize because of security and all that the usenet folks can't
get access to SIMTEL20; however isn't there something that can be done in light
of Bill Wells' recent comments?  If I was on the usenet side and kept seeing
all the msgs about all the good stuff at SIMTEL20, I would be really jealous
or frustrated.

Regards to all,
Jeff Edelheit
(edelheit at mitre)

Jeff - If there is a totally satisfactory answer to the question of getting 
non-DDN people access to the files on Simtel20, I don't know what it is.  The
only solutions I know of that don't require the shipping of files via netmail
are:

	1.  Buying the desired volumes (disks) from SIG/M or CPMUG at their 
	    very reasonable prices.
	2.  Dialing-up a local Remote CP/M system, and transferring the desired
	    files using XMODEM (or some such file-transfer program).
	3.  Sending a request out to netland asking for some kind soul to write
	    the desired files on a disk supplied by the requester.  This method
	    involves use of the U.S. Mail or other delivery service.
	4.  Making an official request through appropriate channels for copies
	    of the archives in the form of DEC-20 dumper tapes.  This takes
	    several reels of 9-track tape, takes a lot of somebody's time, and
	    is of no value to those who don't have a compatible machine to read
	    the tapes.  For large groups of interested users, however, it is an
	    option.  Those wishing to to pursue this course should contact
	    Frank Wancho <wancho@simtel20> for details.  They should also be
	    prepared to be patient.

     I will be happy to receive additional suggestions concerning this matter,
and if I can put together a useful summary, I'll add it to my archive blurb 
that I send to new list people (and periodically to the whole list).  But let's
face it, DDN people, those of us on the ARPA and MILNETs owe a VERY BIG THANK
YOU to Keith Petersen for managing most of the archives, to Rick Conn for
managing the <UNIX> archive, and to Frank Wancho for arranging for the Simtel20
resources to be made available for this service.  Those of us who have direct
access to the machine are DARNED LUCKY!

I have a friend who is trying to get BYE working on his
Zenith Z-100 under CP/M-85 or CP/M-86.
We downloaded BYE3.19 and some of the overlays from 
SIMTEL20.

We couldn't use the HZ100 overlay directly, becuase he
has a PMMI S-100 plug-in modem, instead of an external
modem connected to the Z-100's serial port.
So, we tried the PMMI overlay.

When we run BYE, it prints a sign-on message.
>From thhen on, we can give it a CTRL-C and it will ask
if we want to ressume or re-boot. Both seem to work.

So, what's the problem? When you call, it doesn't
answer the phone!
The PMMI works all right for calling out, using
MDM728. Has anyone else tried using a PMMI
in a Z-100 with BYE?

Any help would be appreciated.

Subject: DU under MP/M
To: info-cpm@amsaa.arpa

I have been trying to get DUV86 working on my MP/M system
(version 2.1).

This version of DU is supposed to be universal, but the
automatic adaptations for MP/M are definitley wrong--it
thinks it is running on CP/M 3, which is only partly right.
MP/M uses the same file system as CP/M 3, but its
BIOS is more like CP/M 2 (except you can't use the address
in 1 to find the BIOS jump table).

Anyway, I made a bunch of changes and it seems to work most of
the time, but I can't quit the program! It just gives a
"?" and the prompt whenever I give it an "X". I'm sure I can
track it down eventually, but I thought I'd ask if anyone
else has already tried to get DU running under MP/M.
I won't rule out the possibility that there are problems
in my hardware or system software, although it has been
fairly stable for the past year.

I have had no trouble using this to work from home across an ancient

I have also seen and used this termcap with my Ozzie, but note that it has a

where it says 'us=\El:us=\Em:'
that should be'us=\El:ue=\Em:'

Otherwise the underlining will not work.  It seemd to me that there was another
bug, but I don't recall where right now...

Re:   yam

I got many programs with no apparent problems, including
yamx.c (x = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7), yam8.csm, yam9.csm, 
and yamman.lst, but yam.h and yam10.c did not come correctly.

The text of these two that came looks like good C code, but
the lengths are wrong and the VAX (VMS) says the record lengths
are  > 1024.

Any ideas? Thanks.

Jim, thanks for telling me about those files.  I fixed them.  The
problem was that they apparently came from a Unix system somewhere and
had only LFs at the end of each line - no CRs at all.  If you find any
others please let me know.  I can fix them in a minute or two with
the text editor here.

In-reply-to: Msg of 23 Apr 1984  10:42-MST from Mike Ciaraldi <ciaraldi at rochester.arpa>

A hint:  I once troubleshooted a problem with a PMMI plug-in modem on
a NorthStar Horizon system a friend owned.  We found there was an
address conflict with the Mother board.  It uses C0h and the default
settings for the PMMI when shipped from the factory are for C0h.  We
moved the PMMI to B0h and reassembled the MODEM program for that port
address and all the problems went away.  He was also able to
sucessfully run BYE (although it was a very early BYE program called
PMMIBYE2 which was specific for that modem).  I suggest you have your
friend try PMMIBYE2.ASM, which You'll find in the MICRO:<CPM.MODEM>
directory.  It isn't fancy like BYE3-19, but it does work.  It would
help a lot if he used this simple BYE first because it would make
troubleshooting much easier.

Does  anyone  out  there know of an Apple II+ CP/M (version 2.23)
intelligent  terminal  program  with  good  file  transfer  (  to
mainframe  computers  like  the  DEC  line)  that  is  not screen
oriented?  I use a braille terminal with my Apple  II+  (and  the
braille terminal functions like a hardcopy terminal).

I  know  that DATACOMM, an intelligent terminal program with file
transfer) for Apple  II+  UCSD  Pascal  is  not  screen  terminal
dependent.   (It  was  written  by D.C.  Hayes Associates.)  I am
looking for a similar one for Apple II+ CP/M (version 2.23).

If you know of any possible candidates, please send me  the  name
of  the  program, as well as the name and address of the software
house that sells it and the possible price.

Thanks for your help.

;	The following patch will fix a problem with the alternate dial-

; you may never plan to use alternate dialing, it would only take a few
; minutes to update your MDM730.COM file to be current.

;
;		2) assemble to get M730DIAL.HEX like this:

YAMMCOM.H is now fixed.  It had the same problem as the others I fixed
- no Carriage Returns, only Line Feeds at the end of each line.  I
wish people wouldn't put files SQueezed under Unix onto CP/M systems
without first restoring the end-of-lines to CP/M CRLF standard!

Does anyone know of a Unix C implementation of the "modem" protocol for
downloading binary files?  My terminal program (chameleon on the atari)
knows how to receive them, but I have been unsuccessful in sending them
on the unix end, even though it seems pretty simple.  A program in some
other language would be okay too as an example.  I already sent a query
to info-atari with no luck.  Thanks in advance.

To: Info-CPM@AMSAA.ARPA

     As a personal software project, I'm attempting to generate a BIOS
for a CP/M 2.2 system (mine!).  Since I've already things up and running
with the manufacturer's BIOS, there are no real problems.. I just want
the experience of putting one together.

     Anywho, I've been going through the listing of the current BIOS
and find something peculiar - every time the console input routine is
called, the current BIOS goes and flushes the disk buffers.

     I can't find anything on this in the CP/M manual.. could someone
out there give me a hint as to why this is being done?  Or do I just
have an oddball BIOS?

     The hardware is an U.S. Micro S-100 12-slotter with their board
set.

Thanks in advance -

In addition to the patch given by Hoff, you had better
also do:
	ORG	806H
	JZ	2008H	;CA 20 08  (was CA 1F 08)

Reason is:
   Irv moved the routine DIALAD3 by one byte with his patch
but forgot to change the address where the branch to that
routine occurs.

Tell your supplier he goofed.  He should have done the patch to BDOS,
shown below.  The "flush buffers" (which may be in BOTH conin and
conout) are completely unneeded and cause unnecessary disk activity.
In addition, some "install" programs (like the one from MicroPro for
DATASTAR) read in one sector of a .COM file, patch it, and then write
it back to disk.  Without this patch nothing happens.

    Re:   SYNONYM art. in Microsystems

    Microsystems has a short review of a program, in the PD, called
    SYNONYM. I gather that the source listing was supposed to be
    included, but lately Microsystems has been pretty sloppy with
    such things, and it got left out. Has anyone seen the program???

Yes, the program is available on SIMTEL20 now.  It's in
    MICRO:<CPM.DIRUTL>SYNONYM2.DOC   and
    MICRO:<CPM.DIRUTL>SYNONYM3.ASM

         SYNONYM is a program that generates a program. This
generated  program  when executed, will invoke  another CP/M
command. It's really not as complex as it sounds. Here is an
example: You would like to  invoke Microsoft basic by typing
only the letter "B" instead of typing  "MBASIC".  You  could
just  rename MBASIC.COM to B.COM but you could no longer use
"MBASIC" to invoke basic.

         SYNONYM  can    create  a  "B.COM"  file  that when
invoked will modify the CCP input  buffer  to  "MBASIC"  and
then  jump  to  the CCP. The new .COM file is very small  (1
block)  and is saved  with  the  $SYS indicator set (in CP/M
2.x )  so it won't clutter up your DIRectory. Then to invoke
basic you would only have to type: "B". You could also  pass
basic  a  program  name  to  execute  just as with MBASIC by
typing: "B BASPGM" (where  BASPGM  is  the name of the basic
program).

        You can also create a SYNONYM with a fixed parameter
string. For example you might like to run  a  basic  program
called  STARTREK.BAS    by typing "ST". SYNONYM can create a
file ("ST.COM") that will invoke  MBASIC and pass it a fixed
string "STARTREK". If you do create a SYNONYM with  a  fixed
paramater  string any paramaters entered on the command line
invoking  the  SYNONYM  will   be   appended  to  the  fixed
paramaters. This could be used to invoke the SUBMIT program,
pass it the name of the .SUB file as a fixed paramater,  and
then any other variable paramaters.

The program can be assembled with MAC or ASM and has been tested on
both CP/M version 1.4 and version 2.x (the $SYS attribute is set only
on 2.x).

    I downloaded YAM428.LBR, and LU301 complains about CRCs.  In addition
    text files seem to be missing CR's.

    (Just thought you'd want to know...)

    				- Matt

Try LU300, Matt.  LU301 is only for CP/M look-alikes and is NOT an
update.  It's a patched LU300 which may not be competely up to specs.

Yes, I know about three files that contain only LF for end-of-line.
Apparently some of the files were SQueezed under Unix instead of CP/M.
You can restore them with USQ-20.COM's -N option, which converts LF's
to CRLF's.  Many people may not know about this -N option, which was
added by Chuck Forsberg to deal with Unix-SQueezed files.

Replaced my Softcard with the 6mhz Applicard + 128k RAMdisk.  Should
have done it a long time ago.  Primary application is text editing using
Mince; with the swap file on the RAMdisk, Mince runs faster than
mainfrrame Emacs at 1200 baud.

Documentation is a little sketchy; basically an installation manual and
a somebody's intro to CPM book.  Several commands are not described in
either set.  OEM documentation available for people wanting to write
funny drivers, etc.  Technical support (questions) is *excellent*.

If you do try to use Mince off the RAMcard, make sure you load mince.com
onto the M:  device *before* you load mince.swp; if mince.swp is the
first file on the disk, Mince crashes.  I know not why ...

The MDM730 program with the M7AP-2B.ASM overlay is supposed to work
with CCS7710 and external modem.  It will work with microsoft softcard
and the Applicard.  It is on-line at SIMTEL20.  I have not tried this
myself but is supposedly works.

I just fired up MDM730 with the M7AP-2B.ASM overlay about 3 days ago -- worked
just fine (though I don't have the Applicard).  Kind of surprised me, but
I put the Apple back to back with my Toad (also running MDM730), doing
transfers over an RS-232 cable -- transfered .COM and ASCII files at 9600
baud with no problems at all!  Would not have expected the Apple to push that
fast!  Now if there were only a way to push 9600 over voice quality phone
lines ...

Subject: New release of KERMIT for CP/M-80
To: Info-Kermit@COLUMBIA-20.ARPA
cc: Info-CPM@BRL-AOS.ARPA, Info-Micro@BRL.ARPA

This is to announce a new release of CP/M-80 KERMIT, version 3.9.  This is not
the long-awaited "modularized" version, but a maintenance release of the
current monolithic version that fixes many bugs and addresses various
shortcomings in the previous release, which was version 3.6.  Here is a brief
list of the changes since version 3.6:

* Fixes & improvements contributed by Greg Small, UC Berkeley, including:
  . A "fuzzy" timer -- imprecise timeouts
  . Some VT52 emulation bugs fixed
  . Bugs with file attribute bits fixed
  . TRS-80 support for both Lifeboat & Pickles & Trout CP/M
  . Morrow Decision I support
  . Separate terminal support for TVI925, ADM3A, "generic CRT" on some systems
  . Buffer boundary checking for recovering from long bursts of noise

* From Kimmo Laaksonen, Helsinki University of Technology Computing Centre:
  . Support for Nokia MikroMikko (a Finnish CP/M system)
  . Filename completion on ESC, a`la TENEX/TOPS-20
  . TRANSMIT command, for uploading a file "bare" (no protocol), with XON/XOFF
  . Miscellaneous fixes & cosmetic improvements

* Contributions from Bernie Eiben, DEC Marlboro, including:
  . Integration of Greg's and Kimmo's changes with working source
  . SET PRINTER ON/OFF during CONNECT (no fancy buffering or waiting)
  . ^C during file transfer returns immediately to command level
  . Source file compaction, removal of update history to separate file
  . Rainbow-100 support removed; use CP/M-86 Kermit from now on.

* From Columbia:
  . 8th-bit prefixing for transferring binary files when parity is in effect
  . Fixed and/or improved communication with IBM mainframes
  . Kaypro II and other display fixes
  . Added code for DECmate-II to transmit BREAK signal
  . SET TIMER ON/OFF, off by default, goes on/off automatically with SET IBM 
  . Default file mode as distributed is now ASCII
  . Misc bug fixes

HEX files have been built for all the systems supported by this program.  
Here is a list of them:

CPMAPPLE	Apple II, Z80 softcard
CPMBRAIN	Intertec SuperBrain
CPMDMII		DECmate II, Z80 card
CPMGENERI	Generic CP/M-80 2.2
CPMHEATH	Heath/Zenith-89
CPMKAYPRO	Kaypro II
CPMMDI		Morrow Decision I
CPMMIKKO	Nokia MikroMikko
CPMOSBORN	Osborne 1 (serial port only)
CPMOSI		Ohio Scientific
CPMPLUS		Generiac CP/M-80 3.0
CPMROBIN	DEC VT180 "Robin"
CPMTRLB		TRS-80 Model II, Lifeboat CP/M-80
CPMTRPT		TRS-80 Model II, Pickles & Trout CP/M-80
CPMTELCON	Telcon Zorba
CPMVECTOR	Vector Graphics
CPMZ100		Heath/Zenith Z100, CP/M-80 (8085 side)

These files are all stored with the suffix ".HEX" in the area "KER:", for
instance KER:CPMDMII.HEX, in normal ASCII format.  The hex files for the
previous release are still available with suffix ".OHX".  There is also a new
Kermit User Guide chapter for this program, KER:CPMKERMIT.MSS and .DOC.  The
entire group of CP/M-80 Kermit files can be referred to as KER:CPM*.*.  Network
users may obtain KERMIT files from host CU20B via NFT (CCNET), or host
COLUMBIA-20 via anonymous FTP (only after 6:00pm on weekdays, ARPANET).  The
hex files may be downloaded to your micro using your old version of KERMIT (or
MODEM7, or any other downloading procedure) and then converted to runnable .COM
format with the LOAD command.  Your old KERMIT.COM should be renamed to
something like OLDKERM.COM for backup and the new one can then be renamed to
KERMIT.COM.

Since this new release is the result of the work of many people at many sites
on many different machines, there can be no guarantee that it works on all the
systems listed above.  It has been tested thoroughly on the DEC VT-180, the
Kaypro II, and the Intertec Superbrain.  I'd appreciate reports about the other
systems.

under a Z80, and achieved improvements of 37% for floating point divide and
25% for floating point multiply.  I asked for advice as to whether or not I
could post these routines to, say, net.sources.  Microsoft tries to
copyright and license F80, the license saying that disclosure would cause
great harm to Microsoft.

Responses: {my comments in braces or paragraphs headed by a '>'}

>By far, the most numerous responses were like:

I don't know about posting the MAC code, but I sure would like to get a
copy of it myself.

>As to the legality of distributing the Source there were several
conflicting answers.  Several people offered lawyer friends to call.  The
"best" answer I could find is:

If the copyright was before Jan 1, 1977, the software fell under the old
copyright act and no one knows what that means.  If it was copyrighted
after Jan 1, 1977 but before Dec 12, 1980 things are different but still
not too clear.  If after Dec 12, 1980, then you can do whatever you want
with re-coding for yourself but not for any other use--including public
domain.

He also said that it was his belief (he is especially interested in this
area) that both copyright and trade secret protection could not be held at
the same time, but that this question has not been litigated as yet, thus
there is no confirmation or denial of his belief.

>Other legal responses from the net were:

About all you can do legally is to distribute a patch list: give the
addresses of locations that you change, and the new contents of those
locations. {This amounts to releasing the REL files}

By the way, Microsoft watches this mailing list {one of the reasons I did
it this way}, so you have just informed them that you are considering
pirating their software.  I wouldn't be surprised if you heard from them.
{Never did hear from them}

>Some practical solutions:

I suppose that if you anonymously send the sources out to this mailing
list, then it will be impossible to trace you down.  {Maybe I could get
them distributed from kgbvax or kremvax  :-)}  That's not a moral solution,
but certainly a practical one.  Anyway, one couldn't use your routines
without the rest of the fortran compiler, so why would Microsoft care?
{Who knows the workings of corporate minds}  You might even offer to give
them a copy for free!

There shouldn't be a problem if you are distributing only the REL files.
People need a Microsoft licensed linker..and so on.. to produce COM files
anyway.

It's too bad the routines were disassembled by someone who signed the
nondisclosure agreement.  Since you can distribute the COM files of any F80
program, it would not be any more difficult to disassemble it with
'appropriately chosen' F80 programs. {Of course, who would go to the
trouble if they didn't have F80.  The disassembly is much more difficult if
you do not have the REL files.  The disassembly was semi-automated, and
took approximately 2 minutes per module to disassemble, and an additional
1/2 to 3 hours to comment. There are over 100 modules in FORLIB.REL (What
some people can do with free time!). }

>The action that best strikes my fancy is (from several sources):

The obvious answer to your real problem is to write MicroSoft a letter
asking for their desires on the distribution. {As previously mentioned,
Microsoft is on USENET, and presumably reads this news group.  I was
disappointed, but not suprised, that I did not hear from anyone at
Microsoft.}

I would suggest that you attempt to get Microsoft's permission to
distribute Z80 mul and div routines for no profit.  If they are reasonable
they will not object.

>>I have now written to Microsoft to ask them what their wishes are
regarding the routines.  However, as one respondent said:

>From what I've heard, they are really bad about customer response.
Personally, I think the turkeys deserve to get shafted.  But don't let that
lead you astray. {I'm not trying to shaft anyone}

>>In the mean time, I reread the license and discovered that I am to make
sure that I do not disclose any information to persons *WHO ARE NOT
REGISTERED USERS* (emphasis mine).  As such, I believe that I can
distribute the source of my modifications to any registered users of F80.
If you are a registered user of F80 and would like to receive the
modifications, please mail your net-address and registration number to me.
I am in the midst of final testing of the routines, and will release them
as soon as I am convinced that they are correct.

Thanks to all who responded.  I tried to reply to all, but the mail may
have gotten lost in the net.

To: Info-Micro@AMSAA.ARPA, Info-CPM@BRL.ARPA

<Why doesn't someone fix this bug?>

     This is for owners of U.S. Micro's or Delta Products 64k dynamic
RAM cards - You might want to check the installation of C6, a 10-to-47
uF capacitor located just to the left of where U2 and U4 butt together.

     On some boards, the silk-screening is backwards!  And the capacitor
may be installed backwards as well.

     Typically this capacitor, after a period of time, will turn into
a resistor and load down the -5V going to the memory chips.  The voltage
on the card I have reached -4V, at which point programs started crashing.

     I replaced it - local Radio Shack had it on the shelf.  Went and
checked three Delta boards and found they had the same problem.

     Other than that, I've found the hardware to be pretty solid - no
other problems in two plus years of operation.

Subject:  Re:  Check your Delta Products/U.S. Micro Sales 64k DRAM boards

Added note:  The problem described by Mark may be VERY SERIOUS if the board
uses 4116 type DRAMS.  (I am not familiar with the board.)  If this is the
case, and if the capacitor mentioned degrades enough to cause loss of the -5V
supply, the result will be immediate and catastrophic failure of ALL of the
dynamic RAM chips.  This is why the power supplies for 4116 RAMs must be
properly sequenced so that the -5V comes up first and goes down last.  If the
board in question does not use 4116's, perhaps someone else can comment about
whether the same vulnerability exists.

Subject: Space crunch and tar tapes

The current collections of public domain files are bursting the seams
of the RP06 that's holding them.  Here are the current disk usage
stats taken Friday afternoon:

MICRO:<CPM.*>		14,818 disk pages
MICRO:<CPMUG.*>		 7,692			15.4 MBytes
MICRO:<SIGM.*>		20,192			40.4
MICRO:<PC-BLUE.*>	 3,260			 6.5
			------			----
Total:			46,019 disk pages	62.3 MBytes

A TOPS-20 disk page is 512 36-bit words, and the above figures include
the values for the superior directories in each case.

On top of that, it also looks like I'll be getting new SIG/M releases
monthly (five more volumes just showed up).  So, to relieve the
potential trauma of lack of elbow room on MICRO:, I have prevailed
upon Gail Zacharias to apply her file type determining algorithms used
in DE-LBR to build another program.  This program analyses each file
and converts only those files which it determines are truly ASCII text
files, but stored in ITS-Binary format, into ASCII text files.  I'll
be running her program on the files in the above directories, except
MICRO:<CPM.*> over the next few days.

This, of course, means that my oft-repeated statement that ALL the
files in those directories are stored in ITS-Binary format will no
longer be true.  To avoid confusion, Gail's program happens to write
out the next generation, which will be .2 in most cases.  This means
that your clue for FTP is that if the filename shows up as file.typ.1,
it is ITS-Binary, and if it shows up as file.typ.2, it is ASCII.  You
will also have an updated .CRCLST to reference, which shows the
storage method for each file.

Simply because ASCII text files are stored five characters per word,
instead of four bytes per word in ITS Binary format, I expect to
recover a considerable amount of file space by using this utility.
However, the catch is, other than looking for the .2 generation
number, that most of the CRC values published with each volume and
elsewhere will no longer match the files stored in ASCII format.

Don't expect the conversions to happen all at once.  Just be forwarned
that things are changing if you see something strange.

Finally, a note for those of you on Unix machines, especially those
not connected to DDN (and thus do not have FTP access to SIMTEL20).  I
have received an updated version of the TOPS-20 tar program which can
now write binary as well as ASCII files to tar tapes.  After I finish
the conversions, I'll see if I can find time to experiment with the
program to see how many tapes will be needed to store all these files.
What I expect we can do is make a set of tapes available to a
volunteer beta site to see if they can be read.  If so, then start
them out to a distribution path to interested sites who are willing to
provide the disk space to keep them online, or to make copies for
further distribution.  Just bear in mind that these files are as-is.

     Both Delta Products and U.S. Micro memory boards I have use 4116
(or equivalent) DRAMS.  Mr. Towson is correct - if the -5V line goes
out of spec, the memory chips will self-destruct.
