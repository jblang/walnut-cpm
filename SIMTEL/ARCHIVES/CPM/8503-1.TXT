I downloaded BU-11.LBR from Simtel to see If I could use it with my system 
 (CompuPro C-HQ540 running under MPM-816) to backup my 40Mb Hard disk.
 The program is very nice: it includes a number of good options (backup single
 or multiple drives, current user area or all, files with attribute set or
 not, etc) and it is much better than my present system. I back up using
 ARCHIVE (COM or CMD), SUBMIT files and SOFTKEY files (a keyboard enhancer
 program for Compupro systems).
 
 Additional features: It generates an alphabetical listing of all non-dupli-
 cated files, prints it and then, as it backs up, it prints a formatted list
 of the files being copied. It prompts for the date and a disk number, and
 this info is used to generate in user 0 of the backup disk a file called
 -<date>.<number>. 

 Problems and questions:
 BU comes setup to manipulate the file attribute F4. This is no good for my
 system where this attribute is used by MPM to disable several features.
 I  modified it  so it manipulates T3 ( the archive attribute bit) and now it
 sets and resets this bit like ARCHIVE ,PIP, etc. 
 
 Problems: The program prompts for a new disk when the backup is full, but
 if a new one is inserted I run into problems under MPM-816. 
 Has anybody modified BU to do the equivalent of a DSKRESET ?
 Is anybody using this program with a Compupro system running under MPM-816?
 
 The program is in MICRO:<CPM.DSKUTL>BU-11.LBR.

On our BSD 4.2 ftp, I use "tenex" mode in ftp to transfer the files from

you have to use itstonorm any more because all the files at simtel20 were

 I have seen this board advertised but I think people should be wary about
 rushing out and buying one even though they seem like a good deal.  Last
 august I decided to add more memory to my machine and their 128k/256k
 dynamic memory board seemed like a good deal too.  However having had
 previous (bad) experiences with dynamic boards for s100 machines I was
 wary. I have a Morrow hard disk controller which does dma so I called them
 up and specifically asked - Will this board function correctly with the
 Morrow HDC-DMA (just about as close to an exact quote as I can do)?
 Answer: YES. Reality: NO.  I did not discover this immediately since
 all my other memory was static and it was not until I ran in a
  configuration where the Lomas board was being used as the target of
 the disk transfer that failure occurred.  By this time the warranty had
 expired so I just sighed and went out and bought another static ram 
 board (sound of toilet flushing).  Even now I am tempted by both the
 price of their new board and the claims about it but dynamic just
 doesn't seem to work in a generic s100/IEEE696 environment.  If
 anyone has had better experiences with dynamic memeory I would be
 pleased to know.  All the boards I know of either don't do dma
 properly or are restictricted to particular cpu, etc etc.

I tried to install dynamic memory in my CompuPro system (8085/8088). The
board could be strapped for up to 8 wait states so I didn't think that
I would have any problems. I figured that in the worst case 8 wait states
would be alright since the memory was so cheap. Wrong! I put the memory
at 0000H and I couldn't get the 8085 to boot under CP/M since the disk 
controller (DISK1) was too fast for the memory even with 8 wait states. 
I put the memory above my RAM16's and tried to use the 8088 (CP/M86) 
debugger to deposit values in the memory without any luck. The only way
I could get the memory to work was to run my 8085 at 2 MHZ with no wait
states. 

The lesson to be learned is that if you have a disk controller that
does DMA don't buy dynamic memory.

Subject: Minor Mex112 bugs
To: rfowler@simtel20.ARPA
Cc: info-cpm@AMSAA.ARPA

Minor bug reports in MEX112:

1.  MEX v112 lost an ASCII capture file and did not save the whole file 
correctly when I exited with a 'CPM'.  This is what I did and what happened:

          Opened ASCII capture file 'TRNSCRPT'
          Recorded ~5k characters
          Stopped record with <esc>-'U'nsave
          Did a couple MODEM2 file tranfers
          Logged out of remote and exited MEX with 'CPM'

     I did get the message 'saving TRNSCRPT' upon leaving MEX, but the file 
contained only ~200 characters.  I've had the problem before and usually solve 
it by 'WRT' the transcript before exiting.  (Forgot to do it this time 
however.)  I don't know if the MODEM2 tranfer had anything to do with it.

2.  A second incident came about when I was attempting the transfer a whole 
batch of keystrings from one version of MEX to another.  Easy, I thought, just 
save FILE.KEY from one and load FILE.KEY from the other.  However, I kept 
getting a 'syntax error' on the load command.  I tracked it down to the '/' 
character in one of the keystrings.  (The use of the back slash '/' character 
is documented in the manual but not in the on-line help file, or at least not 
under LOAD/SAVE or STRINGS.)

     If the keystring has a single back slash as in 'KEY A="cd 
usr/anywhere/anywhat^M" the SAVE command saves it with single backslash.  But 
when the LOAD command reads the key file it expects to see double back 
slashes.  Therefore, I suggest the SAVE command save the file in a form that 
the LOAD command could read it.

3.  (Not really a bug but annoying)  Occasionally during MODEM2 file transfers 
MEX will end the transfer with a "File Transfer Aborted" without any mention 
of NAK's, retries, or other errors.  It usually only occurs which downloading 
long, >50k transfers (naturally!), and with otherwise clean lines (very few 
NAK's).  It has not occured during uploads.  The remote host goes on sending 
blocks after MEX has aborted until the remote computer (I use umodem on the 
remote unix machine) times out.  It is almost as if the local user had typed 
an ^C to abort the transfer.

     Has this been reported before or is it maybe hardware related?  I've not 
had this problem with MDM7 when I used it.  I am using the MXO-NS11 overlay 
for the second serial port on my NorthStar Horizon.

Otherwise, MEX is fine.  I much prefer it over MDM7 as the command interface 
is closer to how I naturally think.  And the read command is great! - as 
umodem doesn't allow batch transfers, I ended up using a read file for a 
psuedo batch transfer of all the zcpr3.com files.  50-some files in 60 
minutes!  I couldn't possibly type the command lines fast enough to do that, 
even if I have enough concentration to jump on the prompts as soon as they 
appeared.

After you unsqueeze the documentation copy it over with pip using the

Info-Cpm,
	Thank you for your help with ftp'ing files from simtel20.  The
solution was simply using the "tenex" mode and not the "binary" mode that
I had used.  Both lar.c and sq107.c/usq107.c work on the resulting files.

Re:   Minor Mex112 bugs

I believe I have the lost character problem tracked: do you have an
abnormally large TPA?  If STAT BUFFER shows a buffer size >32K, then
then MEX gets mixed up.  It seems to be caused by one of the disk
write sector counters being limited to 8 bits.  This only shows up in
the larges of systems.  An interim fix (until I can get out from under
my current workload and issue an update): use MEXPATCH to create a
*real big* phone directory (increase it until STAT buffer drops below
32K).

The '/' problem with keystrings is an algorthm error in the keystring
readback routine; it needs re-writing, and will get it in the next
rev.  In the meantime, I believe that temporarily redefining the
keystring with two '/' characters -- which requires that you type
four, actually -- just prior to saving the .KEY file will work.  I
This, of course, is a *real* pain if you have a lot of keystrings with
slashes in them.

The only download error that doesn't draw a diagnostic is the
out-of-sync problem: typically, a NAK from the receiver gets permuted
into an ACK; the sender begins sending the succeeding record, MEX has
missed the record it NAKKED, and there is no provision in the protocol
to back up.  MEX knows it can't recover from this, and simply branches
to the ABORT routine.  Next time I'll make it print "fatal sync error"
or somesuch.

Note that the latter problem occurs most commonly when transfers are
taking place through a network (or interrupt driven sender).  GZ @MC
explained why this is so a couple of years ago, but the details of her
explanation escape me right now.

I hope to roll a better protocol for MEX 2+<.something>, based on
extensions of the old ...

Thanks for reporting the problems so thoroughly!  Often, I get things
like "SENDOUT doesn't work right", with not clue as to what exactly
doesn't work (in case you're wondering, the problem with SENDOUT
occurs in overlays that loop on status-false in the input-modem-port
routine; this routine should either return 0 if it can't read the
modem port for some reason, or perferably, return the last character
seen).			--Ron

I obtained a 20 Mb 14 inch Calcomp Century Marksman disk drive
some time ago and would really like to be able to hook it up
to my S100 CPM system.  If anyone out there knows anything about
this beast and interfacing it, please send me mail (this is not
of general enough interest for news).  For all intents and purposes
I have what is called a "dumb Marksman" without the Calcomp
intelligent controller card.  What I would particularly like is 
information on the following topics:

	1) Is the interface compatible with anything else?
	   (I heard a rumour that it was 8 inch winchester compatible,
	   but that seemed only true for the Calcomp intelligent card)
	2) Are the Konan S100 adapters for these things
	   still available? - I heard that they went out of business.
	   Is it using the dumb or intelligent interfaces?
	3) If I gotta get a Calcomp intelligent card, where to I 
	   find one?
	4) Is there anyone out there at XEROX (who I heard took over
	   the Calcomp disk division) and knows about this beastie?
	5) Has anybody out there got one?

I have an intelligent card (seems to support RS232, SDLC and DMA)
for it, but Zapsystems went out of business, and only RS232 software
is present on the card.  It doesn't run fast enough with RS232
to make it worthwhile using it serially, but it is a nice interface
for testing the drive with a terminal.

for the convenience of those who already have the Z3 files and just want to
update.

	DU3.MAC and DU3.COM -- updated DU3
	VFILER.MAC and VFILER.COM -- updated VFILER
	IF.MAC and IF.COM -- updated IF
	TCSELECT.MAC and TCSELECT.COM -- updated TCSELECT (special for ZNODE/RCPM use)
	POKE&GO1.DOC -- comments on how to use RCPs and aliases to
		modify COM files on the fly
	Z3NEWS.106 -- latest newsletter from Echelon

VFILER.MAC and DU3.MAC are quite large, so, in Z3NEW, is VFILER.MQC
and DU3.MQC for the convenience of downloading.

	Enjoy!

Subject: Cross Assemblers

Bernie, do you have any available cross assemblers for Motorola 6800
and 6809 MPUs that run under CP/M?  I've seen public domain types (a la
LASM) out in the free world before, but I don't remember where.  I 
haven't seen one here, but then I never am sure I'm looking in all the
right places on this machine.  Anything you might have stored here
would be of considerable help -- I don't really want to buy some if I
don't have to.

					Thanks,

    Whenever I try to retrive POKE&GO1.DOC from micro:<cpm.z3new>
    I get "File not accessable. Invalid character in filename."
    The ampersand???

Peter, you hit the nail right on the head.  Some characters are
reserved under the TOPS-20 operating system we use here at SIMTEL20.
The solution is to include a Control-V just ahead of such characters
when you tell FTP what file you want.  In this case it would be:

MICRO:<CPM.Z3NEW>POKE^V&GO1.DOC

(where the ^V is a control-V, of course).  The control-V is a "quote
next character" command.

On harvard, the xlisp source is in /pub.  It's also archived on

Here are Bob's comments about the package.
---
3 March 1985

Here are the files that make up version 8.6 of the W0RLI
Packet Radio MailBox/BBS/GateWay system.

There have been many changes since version 6.9 was posted to
the SIMTEL20 archives. A change history is in the file
NOTES.TNC.  A few of the major ones are:

 1)   The program has been converted to M80/L80 source language.
      It got too big for ASM/MAC.
 2)   Automatic forwarding of mail among packet systems is
      supported. This requires a user list in the file FWD.TNC.
 3)   The BIOS got too big, too. There is now a two stage bootstrap,
      with the second stage in the file CBIOS.COM, also as described
      in NOTES.TNC.

This system runs on the following hardware:

Computer:
	Xerox 820-1 computer (the ones that were available for $50,
			      and are still around for not much more),
	one or more 8" single density, single or double sided disk drives,
	parallel keyboard, CRT monitor.

Packet Radio gear:
	One or Two TAPR (or AEA) TNCs with version 3.1 or later software.
		(Two TNCs if you are going to run a crossband Gateway.)

Radio gear:
	One or two transceivers.

The W0RLI software supports sending, receiving and forwarding
mail, uploading and downloading files, capturing typescripts,
logging channel activity and mailbox activity, and gateway
operation between two TNCs on two bands.

Read the file NOTES.TNC to start working your way through the
documentation.


Hank, W0RLI, does not have access to ARPANET or Usenet.  I will be
glad to try to answer questions and/or relay questions and comments
to Hank via 2 meters.  You can reach me at
 ARPANET: clements@BBN 
 Usenet:  {ihnp4, linus, wivax, decvax, wjh12, ima}!bbncca!clements


Hank would appreciate knowing of users who are running this software.
A QSL to Hank or a net message to me would be appreciated.

Here is Hank's update from the February 1985 NEPRA PacketEar:

   The MailBox/GateWay has now been sent to 25 states and 5 countries.
As far as I know for sure, it is on the air at least 20 places now. In
the Boston area, 4000 messages have passed through it. The local
forwarding network now includes 9 nodes: W0RLI, WB2OSZ, WB1DSW, K1BC,
WA2RRKN-2, K7PYK, WA4SZK, KA1T, W1AW-4. The last two run their own
software, but allow for forwarding from the W0RLI systems.

   A message put into any one of these systems will find its way to the
system nearest the intended recipient.

   There are several other areas of the country now using the
software:  Georgia, Arizona, Iowa, Washington DC, Seattle, ENY/NYC/NNJ,
Dallas, Illinois, Southern New Jersey, Los Angeles have all been heard
from. All have the software in daily use.

   Expect to see it on Oscar-10 at KL7GNG soon.

   Look for it from Australia, New Zealand, Japan, Hungary.

   Sacramento county RACES will be using it.

   GateWays are running at W0RLI, K7PYK, WA4SZK and WB7DCH.

I am posting this for a friend who has patented a Korean character generator

the CP/M command line editor works. Specifically, how are characters deleted

Word*, but the command line editor seems to be different. Any help and

I'M NEW HERE.  I found the directory of bboards while wandering
through the ARPA net (DDN) and am hoping that this is the right
address to ask my questions.

1. I have been thinking of getting a ram disk for my KayPro II
(which has some Micro Cornucopia mods to it, and Plu-Perfect's
CPM mod).  MicroSphere offeres one and there is the SWP Co-Power
-88.  Does anyone have any comments regarding the trade-offs
between them?  Or can you refer me to past discussions on the
subject?  Is there really anything worth doing in MS-DOS that the
SWP device can do?

2. Is this a legit forum for asking what I can do next in the
Mike Goetz 550 pt Adventure?  I've got a "London Dry" flask, a
second mushroom, and an unmoveable dinghy, and no place left to
go.

   Seems like there's a rash of this going aroound.  First it was VDIR,
now SAP.  I guess the only way to avoid this sort of thing is for ALL
RCP/M SYSOPS to copy any un-heard-of file to a floppy (unless this joker
renames it to an existing program... shiver) and test it out there.  It's
certainly an inconvenience for RCP/M SysOps, but it's better than losing
the contents of your hard drive.

I'm confused.  I have only a limited amount of time to get files
from SIMTEL20 (I'll be off the net i 3 months) and have yet to
figure out how to unsqueeze files onces they're FTP'd here.
ZCPR3 looks like a good software package to spend my time on
getting to my micro, but it appears to be way too large to
run usefully on my Z80: 2 ss/dd disks, 188Kb each.  Has anyone
usefully and efficently used these programs with limited disk 
space?  I FTP'd the ZCPR newsletters and they only confused me
further since it looks like a hard disk is needed for the most
effective use of ZCPR.  Should I spend my time trying to get 
Small C running instead?  Any opinions would be appreciated

A message on TCBBS stated that SAP41 wrecked disks!  I had to try it,
Sure did!  Compare SAP41 to SAP40 and in the "CLNLOP" routine of SAP41
there is a jump:

     JC    FIL$E5

in SAP40 it is:

     JZ    FIL$E5

This would replace each valid directory with "E5"s.

You can do it with PIP, but if you want to get two side-by-side computers
talking, but dollars to doughnuts you're gonna need a null modem cable.

You are right that ZCPR3 thrives best in a hard disk environment,
but it also is useful in small floppy disk environments.
One of the newsletters addressed this question, and a tradeoff table was
presented which discussed the tradeoffs.  I personally use ZCPR3 on a
hard disk most of the time, but I also have several applications disks
which have around 60K of disk overhead devoted to ZCPR3 itself
(MENU, VMENU, and VFILER systems).

You have many options other than SIMTEL20 thru which ZCPR3 can be acquired.
SIG/M is one, Echelon is another, and RBBS systems is a third.  Some computer
clubs are giving seminars on ZCPR3 installation also.

Re Small C, I believe that similar options (SIG/M, RBBS, computer clubs)
exist also.

How to best use your time?  I would recommend that you first acquire
all of the pointers info you can (RBBS list, address of SIG/M, address
of Echelon, ZCPR3 Helper list, etc) so that you can continue accessing
the software after your net access goes away.  Once you have this, can
the CPM directories on SIMTEL20 and explore whatever tickles your
fancy.  Lots of good stuff all thru the directories.

Subject: MOV transient protectors

I can't see why more than one MOV would be necessary to protect the AC
power (hot to neutral), because I can't see anything that would drive
a transient from hot to ground or ground to neutral.  Big, inductive loads
switching on and off (motors, relays) create transients from hot to
neutral.  Any sources outside the building can only drive transients from
hot to both ground and neutral, because ground and neutral are connected
at the circuit breaker box.  Assuming the building is wired with grounded
outlets, all three wires run in parallel from the breaker box to the outlet,
so even VHF radiation can't drive a big differential mode signal.  The only
source I could think of for a big signal from ground to something else is
a lightning strike to just one wire - and I wouldn't expect any MOV to
handle that!                - Jim Van Zandt

If you look into the box of the Keyboard you will probably find a 
microcontroller running it. If that is the case and it is an EPROM
version, (or even if it has an EPROM equivalent) You will need to
dump out its software, find the table of ascii characters it sends
(usually a serial table from 0-7FH but may be grouped differently,
eg 0-1F,40-5F,20-3F etc) The distinguishing factor is usually the
all numbers from 0-7F appear exactly once, and in a space that is
80H bytes long. Once you have this info (assuming you dumped it into
a programmer capable of programming the EPROM version of your micro
controller) You can find the ascii representations of the keys you
want to redifine in the table and replace the ascii code that a Dvorak
keyboard would return. Then program the new micro controller, (*always*
save the old one so you can go back to square 1 if you need to) install
it and voila, Dvorak in hardware.

I tried MLOADing everything despite the Undefined-errors while assembling
MXO-AP12, and MEX just warm-booted after giving the welcome blurb.  (I

   Is there another overlay out for the Apple (using SSM serial card) that

GE also makes a surge protector suitable for connecting to a 120/240 v
single phase residential service entrance.  It is self-contained with
a conduit nipple, and is attached to a knockout hole in the service
entrance panel by the main switch (I don't remember the catalog number
but any electrical supply house should be able to get it (or an
equivalent made by a competitor) for you).

I looked at some GE literature I have, and it appears that the
voltage rating is in terms of the DC voltage level at which the
MOV starts conducting.  GE  gives both the DC and AC levels in
their specs.  For example, for the V18ZA1, Maximum Continuous
Voltage: DC 14 V; AC 10 V RMS.

Which board was strapped to 8 wait states? If it was your memory the next
question becomes does the disk-1 even recognize waitstates on the bus?
An acquaintence at one of the local computer clubs spent a long time
developing a set of PALs (Programmable Array Logic) that could fully implement
the IEEE TMA (DMA to the rest of the world) spec that did take into account
external ready from the destination or source memory addresses. If done in
individual chips the circuit would have been quite large (he estimates 15 to
20 packages)

I have heard that the problems with Dynamic Ram and DMA were one of the most 
hotly debated subjects at the IEEE-696 meetings. And the end result was a 
workable solution but not many DRAM boards at the time met them.

Subject: ramdisk on kaypro's
Cc: garey@UT-NGP.ARPA


	I've seen both the SWP co-88 board and the Microsphere board in
action.  I prefer the Microsphere board.  You can by the board sans RAM's
for about $200 and right now 256K rams can be bought for about $10 each
so that one megabyte ram is about $320.  This gives you a 1 meg ramdisk
with built in print buffer for about $520.  Also the board is mounted
in a box externally (my friend put it inside the kaypro though), connected
through the parallel port, and provides a new parallel port for the
printer hook-up.  Also there is a provision for hooking it up to a separate
power supply so you can turn off your kaypro without turning off the
ramdisk.

	The SWP board goes inside the kaypro, mounted behind the drives.
It attaches through a piggyback board on the Z80 socket, so this may
preclude other upgrades that connect in the same way.  The board is limited
to 256K ram, which isn't enough to interest me (I have 2 800K floppies).
The 8088 coprocessor is allright, but because of limitations of the
kaypro as a terminal it can run very little ms-dos software.  I have a
friend that managed to get most of a C compiler working on it but a utility
package that came with the compiler wouldn,t run.

	if you want to mess around a little with ms-dos, and don't mind
a small (256K) ram disk, the SWP board would be ok, but so far it is 
unexpandable, and of 4 people I know with it, none are at all happy with
its performance as a coprocessor running ms-dos.

	I HAVE A QUESTION NOW--------

	Has anyone out there managed to get a hard disk running on a Kaypro?
I'm about to attempt it.  There is a company called HDS out in California
that sells an adapter that goes in the Z80 socket and provides a SASI 
interface for a hard disk. The price is $95 and supposedly includes the
BIOS patch and formatting software etc.  The trouble is I've called them
3 times so far.  Each time I get an answering service and am promised
that HDS will call me back later and they never have.  i'm not sure I
want to deal with a company like that at all, but if their adapter works
then for $250 (for a Western digital Hard Disk controller), and $200 to
$400 for a 10 mbyte hard disk, plus $50 or so for cables and a power supply
adds up to $650-$750 for the set-up, less if I use the $75 5 Meg disks 
available.
	Does anyone have any suggestions or experiences to relate about 
putting a hard disk on a Kaypro?

I made the Micro-C II to IV mod to my KayPro (Highland Microkit's
implementation) last night.  I added the Micro-C Pro monitor 8,
but left my SSDD 191k drives in place (Priority 1 is still
testing the DSDD remex 2/3 height ones i sent back.)  Now none of
the disks with the Plu-Perfect cpm "2.2E" system on them will
boot.  The 2.2 distributed with my KayPro does boot.  I didn't
know how much I liked 2.2E until I tried to use old 2.2 again.
Anybody know what's wrong?

  The "official" word that I got internally (within DEC, not intra-
  dermally) is that DEC has not dropped production of the Rainbow
  but is re-fitting the Rainbow production facility to produce some-
  thing else.  I also heard that DEC should be announcing new features
  and upgrades for the Rainbow within the next month.  Where these
  things will be produced is what I don't know.

If someone has a copy of this utility and would mail it to me, I

The subject of this bug(?) report is CATLOG as found on SIMTEL.  We have been
using the catalog series for many years and have had little difficulty with any
of the utilities found within.  Until now, that is.  It seems that when creating
very large MAST.CAT files (in excess of 2500 entries - 70K or thereabouts), that
XCAT fails to do its job correctly.  The symptom is that after reporting +/-
1200 entries, or 32K worth, of data, XCAT quits!  This is happening to me and to
one or two others in the DC area who have created large catalogs of their col-
lections; in excess of 32K.  What is happening?  Is there an equate or piece of
code that must be changed to permit XCAT to be fully functional on 32K+ files??

Upon looking at the source, and not being much of an assembly language program-
mer, I suspect that the problem could be in the vicinity of the FCB being
brought in and its relationship with the identification of the next extent to
be accessed.  Has anyone else had experience with this innocuous little irri-
tation?  If so, please leave a fix here so we can all enjoy this good program.

By the by, the version of XCAT being used is 4.2, dated 8/22/84.  I think
Irv Hoff had something to do with this version.

Another problem, although not seen as a bug by me, it is an irritation that 
could be alleviated.  The symptom is that when using PRINTLST everything goes
fine until PRINTLST comes across a line of disk numbers (representing multiple
copies of one program) that extends beyond the number of columns available for
their display.  Upon seeing a blank field at the beginning of the next line,
due to their being more numbers to report from the previous program listed,
PRINTLST goes into never-never land.  Is there a simple fix for this???

Any help that can be given will be greatly appreciated.  Thanks in advance...

Hi--
You can readily relocate Plu*Perfect Systems' CP/M 2.2E
to be compatible with the Micro-cornucopia Kaypro II rom.

A 63.00K 2.2E system will run DateStamper and 4 quad-density
drives with that rom.  If you don't have DateStamper (you should get it!)
you can go up to 63.75K.

CP/M 2.2E disk versions K-1C or K3-A and later are needed to
support this relocation.  Upgrades are still $5 plus original disk.
Check with Ed at Plu*Perfect (714-659-4432) for further details.

Cc: chatham@USC-ISI.ARPA


	The problem is Plu-Perfect is a replacement bios.  You probably
had the version for the II.  The pro-8 rom requires a Kaypro IV BIOS to
work properly, I know, because I've been running the Pro 8 rom since it
came out.  It may or may not work with single sided disks with a II bios,
but certainly will not run with double sided disk drives and a kaypro II
bios.  The problem with your REMEX drives may well be that you were 
trying to run double sided drives with a bios set up for single sided drives.
	Find someone with a Kaypro IV and get them to sysgen a disk for you.
also get their "Kaypro IV" version of sysgen and config.com, because
the "Kaypro II" versions of these utilities don't work properly on "IV"
disks.
	As for the Plu-Perfect stuff, you'll have to contact them about
getting the Kaypro IV version.

   Does the 6.0 MHz Z80B have the same pinout as the 4.0 MHz Z80A?  Can
I replace the Z80A with the Z80B by simply switching chips and not making

Ken - The words I am now hearing indicate that the production of the 
"original" Rainbow has stopped, but a new version that is compatible with the
IBM-PC will soon be announced (released, shipped?).  The statement was that
the new version would also support CP/M-86 and supposedly be compatible with
the original machine.

I guess it goes to show that you can't trust Computerworld.

I am running an Osborne Executive with CP/M+ [3.0] and am desperately
looking for a good advanced CP/M+ programmer's reference. Osborne is
not too helpful in this area. Any recomendations are welcomed. If there
is enough response, I will summarize and post. Please mail ideas,

not, do any of the other pascal packages ? Thanks in advance...

Keith Patterson and info-cpm,
	I too had difficulty installing small c and after talking to Ron
Cain (the original author), I fixed several of the files and included
jump tables (which Ron said were there, when he gave it to Jim Hendrix).
I also wrote a three page installation checklist.

several difficulties.  If someone can assist me in reaching
Keith, I
would like to see the files on the archive corrected.
	At the time of this message, I have not yet brought up version
2.  I am instead looking at development of a relocating linker and a
series of languages (ASM, Z80ASM, C80, F77, etc.) that will produce
standard relocatable code, so that the languages can be mixed and matched
to the particular job.  (Lisp = superior node, C = control level, Fortran =
number crunching)  The features that I seek most are virtual memory, and
library searching for unsatified linkages.  After being burned by buying
expensive commercial software that turned out to be woefully inconsistent,
or mutually incompatible, and finding no public domain software that
meets the needs, I outlined a development schedule to generate such.
If someone out there knows of, is working on, or is interested in working
on such a project (spare time), please contact me.

Subject: re: z80A/z80B pinouts



You can replace the chips with each other.  I went from a 2.5 MHz z80 to a
Z80B that I run at 5 MHz on my Kaypro.  To use the higher clock rate the
B chip is capable of you need to change the clock signal.  On the Kaypro
there are 4 and 5 MHz signals available so a simple jumper is all thats
required.  However I have a Z80H (8 MHz) on order.  From what I gather, I'll
need to either change crystals or add a circuit to divide off an 8 MHz
signal from somewhere.

The hitch is that the computer is designed for one speed.  I've also had to
reburn the two eproms in my machine on faster parts.  other possibilitys of
problems are the speed of the ram chips.  Some people have had to also upgrade
their SIO's and PIO's to the "B" rating, but mine have been fine.

I bet if there is a user's group for whatever computer you have, someone there
has done it and can help you.

I have a CompuPro Disk1 that I've been using with an ExpandoRam dynamic
card for years!  The only problem I've ever had with the dynamic RAM card
was in conjunction with an el-cheapo Z-80 CPU card which I believe was
solvable, but I decided to scratch the CPU card anyway.  How fast is the
RAM supposed to be?  is it only 2 MHZ?  I would think that the DMA
speed would be somewhat governed by the rate it's coming off the disk
which ain't that fast.  Are you sure that speed is the problem?  If
by some chance the DMA is being clocked with the CPU's clock, maybe
something can be done to use a divided by 2 clock for the DMA.  However
before attempting something like this, I'd make sure that you really have
your finger on the problem.

One of the ways I converted from an IBM EBCDIC keyboard to an ASCII 
computer input was to read the incoming eight bits from the keyboard and 
use them as the second byte to address a "page" of memory (256 bytes). At 
each individual address was the ASCII equivalent of the EBCDIC code----
worked like a charm.  

Should be possible to do the same thing to simulate a Dvorak keyboard----
read the ASCII keyboard, place the Dvorak equivalent at the addresses and 
provide that value to the computer input.

Does require programming in assembly language, though.

Last month (I think) in BYTE there was a letter that claimed that
someone is now producing an S-100 bus CPU board that will plug into
any Compupro system & will let you run both CPM-86 & MS-DOS.  The
letter implied (or seemed to) that with this board, I could run IBM PC
programs.  Does anyone out there know any more about this?

I am very sceptical because the IBM PC & programs written for it
involve a lot more than just the CPU.  Specifically, the keyboard &
screen interfaces are very well defined.  I am very interested because
I have over $2K worth of PC SW I acquired during a consulting contract
that I can't presently use because I have a CP/M system.  I don't want
to throw away all of my CP/M stuff & I don't want 2 completely
incompatible systems.  Does anybody have any ideas (other than the
board mentioned above)?

NetLandians,

Stumbled across the (new?) directory in our treasure trove MICRO: at
SIMTEL20...
MICRO:<CPM.XCCP>etc.etc.

Really NICE utility!  Plugs right in, runs great (even with my much abused
and hacked CCP, BDOS, and BIOS).

Gives you multiple commands on the command line, a kind of file name expansion
for certain commands, easy switching from/to user area and disk, default
searching of Disk A User 0.

Replaces several patches I had already done to my own system, and several
SUBMIT-type utilities I was using for "batch" jobs.

No source code for the .COM file, unfortunately, so thank goodness it works
so well!  Really a nice job - try it!

Please don't tell my Intersystems Box! I'd hate for the DMA to quit working

Perhaps you caught a reference to Compupro's video board.  That
provides software with PC-compatible graphics (so I'm told), and
therefore enables your Compupro dual-processor or 86/286 board to run
MSDOS with a reasonable chance of compatibility with the PC.  The
board I'm referring to also has a keyboard plug, so that you can run
with a PC-compatible keyboard, and bypass the system console i/o.  The
central processor is not on this board, however, so if you're running
a 8-bit CP/M system, you'd still need the 8088 from someplace.

I'm expecting to see a demonstration of this video board at the next
Piconet Compupro SIG meeting in 2 weeks; -- if anyone's interested,
I'll let you know what my impressions are after I see it (smell it,
etc).

Subject: Bad SIG/M files fixed

Earlier we had discovered some "bad" SIG/M files in the earlier
volumes and Keith Petersen managed to get quite a few fixed.  Last
month Mike Niswonger (CNISWONGER@SIMTEL20) volunteered to check them
out again and spent several weeks correcting any remaining
discrepancies.  His report of the final status is available as a
regular ASCII text file in MICRO:<SIGM>BAD-SIGM.FILES.2.

If you had the occassion to grab files from the following volumes
prior to 18 Feb 85, it would be a good idea to check Mike's report to
see if you need to get the corrected copies:

004   029   050   064
005   034   051   065
006   037   052   066

026   044   061   079
                  085

Thank you Keith and Mike!

Finally, I am aware that SIG/M volumes 157, 159, and 161 are still
missing.  We should have that situation corrected in the near future.

I have a Cromemco System 3 running CP/M.  Currently it has
a 4FDC controller and a pair of Persci 277 drives (SSSD).
I'm considering an upgrade to some combination of floppy
and hard disk systems.  I would like to know if
anyone has experience doing something similar, and what
combinations of software/controllers/drives they have found
particularly useful or useless.

Thanks,
Aaron

	Its taken me a while, but I am finally getting around to
reading some of the classic "how to" computer science/programming
texts.  Currently, I am working on Kernighan & Plauger's "Software
Tools" and have found it interesting reading.  In particular, I
find the section on editing most interesting and am considering
coding the editor, edit, that they present.  The text seems
quite complete, and the exercises present some useful suggestions
for improvements.
	As I am running a CP/M rather than a Unix-like system,
I realize there will be some differences in the file handling
routines and possibly a few other places.  What I would like to 
know is whether anyone else has attempted this conversion and what 
was your experience?  Please no flames about why I would want to do 
this when there a SO many editors available, I have my reasons.
Please reply by mail.  Thanks in advance for your help.

Well, I haven't messed with the System 3 that we had at my old
job, but it seems to me that we had nothing but troubles with both
the Persci 277 and 299 drives. They were constantly gouging diskettes.
In addition, both the 4FDC and 16FDC controllers we had were constantly
sent in for repair. I would stay away from any of these items.

I've been familiarizing mysef with the CP/M world via a Softcard
and Apple II+ combination.  As you know, there exist other Z-80
cards which will also work within CP/M.  My question concerns
what people call standard CP/M. Given any program written for
the CP/M operating system, what if any changes  are required to 
adapt it  to Apple CP/M ? Is there such thing as a standard set of changes
to be made? What books detail this information?

I can see that if the Apple CP/M is a superset of the standard CP/M
system; then no problems shoud arise unless the program written
specifically for Apple's version is run on a standard system.

DR's version 2.23
------------------

I d'ont know if the new version of CP/M from "mom" is a mixed blessing.
It provides 4k more room for the TPA, but has changes things in the
BIOS and DOS .  A  friend of mine's says that older files are
generally readable under the new system. But ultilities which
modify system dependent parameters will also have to be changed.
For exampble, He can no longer use his existing 'init' file
to set up his "Saturn 128K card" as ram disk under version 2.23.
Is anyone out there familiar with the advantages, diaadvantages, mods
required to existing stuff , etc resulting from the new release.

P.S. Does BDS C run on Apples?

Folks...

My video board has just died and I want to get a terminal for my S-100
system.  I'm getting conflicting reports from the vendors about quality
of various brands so I thought that I would address the question to the
"unbiased" members of this distribution list.  Here's what I want...

At least 25x80 character size but I would like 132 columns avail. for
spreadsheets

Detachable Keyboard is a need!

Lots of function keys (I run FinalWord and lots of keys are really nice)

19.2 KBaud RS-232C speed

Amber Screen (not necessary but I'm used to it)

Price - around $600 (obviously less is better)

This describes a pretty much plain vanilla terminal.  Which ones are in
use out there in netland?  Which ones do you like?  What about
reliability?

Last of all - I would be agreeable to purchasing a used model from
anyone out there who is interested in selling theirs.  Send me specs and
$$ information over the net.

Thanks

Wyse-50 looks like a very good one in the class you want - if you ask
directly or send a reader-response card from an ad you can get more
info.  Price = $489 (Page 401, Feb BYTE - 'Silicon Specialties')

Quicky info:
	14" screen
	24x80 or 24x132
	7x13 matrix, 128 ascii chars, 32 line drawing graphics
	detached keyboard
	101 keys
	16 programmable function key/ 32 combinations
	soft setup/smooth scroll (4 speeds!)
	modem spped to 38.4 baud
	compatible with ADM-31/TVI/ADDS viewpoint/Hazeltine

I don't have one (but wish i did) - Maybe some other netlandian can
talk about reliability ...

I believe Lear Ssiegler also has one in the Wyse-50 class - I think I
saw it in this months (Mar) BYTE.

Subject: Re: What's a good terminal???

I like the Wyse-50 a lot.  I've got one at home, and we've got about
20 at work.  Reliability is pretty good -- the ones we send back usually
don't work the first time (e.g., they don't fail months later).  We've
gotten a few that have a problem with the flyback transformer, and emit
an obnoxious high-pitched whine.  Also, some of the yokes aren't adjusted
correctly, so the screen is sorta tilted.

Now the real problems...

This has the famous ``attribute-takes-space'' problem.  That means that
there is an extra space when switching between attributes.  This
is a real pain, especially because most programs (editors, etc.) don't
know about this space.  Solution:  if all you want is reverse video or
dim (and don't need BOTH), you can use ``protected'' mode, and make
all protected chars appear in {reverse,dim}.  This is what we do.

There is a ``feature'' that turns on the auxiliary printer port and
disables the screen output and keyboard, causing the terminal to lockup
until it receives the ``printer-off' command.  Unfortunately, the
printer-on code is a ^X, which is line-kill to some machines.  If the
machine echos all chars (like our Tandem), or if you are running half-
duplex or on a TAC, this can be a big problem.

Another problem related to this is that there is a printer-on
command which does NOT lock out the screen.  Problem is, you can't tell
whether or not it's on, and if you are running the screen faster than
the auxiliary port (which can only go at a max of 19200), you start
losing chars to the screen).

Tracy - Try looking at some of the Qume terminals.  Also, any number of 
VT-220/100 look-alikes with lots of pf keys (like Televideo). 

Stay away from the HDS terminals.  They have a bad habit of breaking and
are rather expensive to fix.

MXO-APCC.ASM was a WORKING replacement, but it doesn't seem to assemble
any better than MXO-AP12.  Same "U"ndefined errors, and warm boots to
CP/M after displaying the MEX welcome message (I went ahead and MLOADed
it anyway), just like MXO-AP12.

   Is there a MEX overlay for Apple CP/M & SSM serial card around that

I must take exception to the warning about HDS terminals.  We have
~10 HDS Concepts (the older one with the bettter keyboard), and
although we have had some failures (apparently one particular
capacitor on the video driver board), I have yet to see a nicer
terminal.

Amber screen, 80/132 columns, 4 pages of memory standard, line and
printer port (which can be configured as a second line), fully
programmable function keys.  There is an option for even another

Are there versions of modem7 that work with the turbodos operating
system.  We are using teletek masters and slaves.  How about BYE?
Also, is there an overlay for the Morrow Decision 1?  (Not the
Microdecision).  Thanks.

FLAME ON!
 The above response is not very useful - "it worked for me...
 must be a law of nature or something I guess :-) "

 The problem is much more complicated than that, simplistic replies
 contribute little.
FLAME OFF!


  I think the point really is that on S100 systems you won't
 know if dynamic memory will  work with your system until you try it;
 then if you change some component sometime down the road everything
  may not be so peachy keen.  As an example some z80 cards bring out
 the z80 refresh signal to the bus which the memory then uses to do
 refresh cycles without causing wait states; if your memory depends
 on this then you will not be able to change cpu's (ever). Another
 aspect is that the term "IEEE/696 compatible" sems to be a *very*
 flexible term in some manufacturers minds so maybe you get a system
 where the cpu or a dma interface isn't quite within specs. A system
 with static memory will probably run with no problems but the weird
 contortions that dynamic memory boards must go through in order to
 maintain refresh while minimizing/eliminating wait states will very
 probably cause it to fail.
 
 Another example : some systems try for an overall io speedup by
 buffering whole disk tracks. An st506 disk will require >3.2 ms
 to transfer just two 1k sectors; the refresh period of the rams
 is 2ms, so unless your disk controller is willing to allow the
 memory to have wait states (which it may very well do - however it
 is *not* to be taken for granted) or the memory can sneak refresh
 cycles in while the interface isn't looking (some try to sync up
 with bus activity and do their refresh cycles after a memory
 access, which because of the speed of an st506, would work in this
 case) then your system will not work.
 
 Another example : because of the way static rams are set up you
 can leave the chips enabled all the time and feed in the address
 bus continually to the chips; when the control circuitry on the
 board decides the board is actually being addressed for a memory
 cycle it can gate the data lines to/from the chips and set the
 read/write enable appropriately.  Beacuse of the timing of most
 of the micros there is a significant delay between the address
 appearing on the bus and the control/status information describing
 the cycle appearing on the bus - using the above technique (which
 is implemented on a board I own) can decrease board access time
 by significant amounts (50-100 ns).  The way that addresses are
 gated into drams (and cycles initiated) precludes doing this.
 
 and on and on and on and on.......
 
 Opinion: do not buy a dram board unless you know (or someone you
          trust tells you) that it will work in the configuration
          in which you plan to use it; if you buy it be prepared
          to have to throw it out if you ever want to change any
          part of your system that does dma (including/especially
          the cpu).
 
 Opinion: if you buy everything from the same manufacturer it will
          probably all work but eventually you will have the same
          problem as above (unless the same manufacturer also makes
          the new board as well).

 Opinion: I think that one of the big reasons for the decline of
          S100 popularity is dynamic memory - for what it costs
          to buy one 64k static board for an s100 you can get
          256k dynamic boards (that work) for pc clones; I mean
          geez, for the price of one Compupro 256k static board
          you can get a complete sanyo mbc, with disk drive,
          monitor, software, and 256k.  I think this is a crying
          shame - s100 systems are flexible and do not commit
          you to a single manufacturer, the bus interface is
          actually very simple and the entire s100 concept
          encourages proliferation of ideas, products and concepts.
          Micros today seem to be heading towards a very mainframe
          mentality - medicority dominates.
 
 Opinion: There is no reason why a good s100 dynamic board could
          not be made for <500 with 1mbyte of no wait state (and
          refesh states <5% of the time) memory, given the LSI
          dram controllers available and the current price of
          256k chips. Just keep to the standard.
   and on and on and on ......
 
 Sorry to be so lengthy,

Is there a public-domain program to convert assembler

to Zilog mnemonics?  Ideally it would also handle the extensions to the 8080
mnemonic set for Z80 instructions.

(I have a friend with direct arpanet access so I can get things from SIMTEL20

Has anybody used the AMPRO SCSI/plus adapter, particularly on something
OTHER THAN an Ampro little board?  Especially on a DEC VT180?

I'm gearing up to put hard disk on my VT180, a classic "closed" Z80/CPM
system, and this is the best-looking approach I've found yet.

Also, how likely am I to find "scsi-compatible" disk controllers that
won't work with this adapter?  And how likely am I to find "ST506"
disk controllers that don't work with some particular "ST506 compatible"
drive?  How careful do I have to be choosing my pieces?

Is there any hope taht 
oops tHAt the DMA chip option will work with my
existing system?  What is it likely to conflict with?

Tracy,

I've been using my faithful Freedom 100 (Liberty Electronics) since they
first came out, and have been quite happy.  However, not 132-column, and
the function keys are NOT truly programmable!

I understand their newer models (150?) do have programmable function
keys and 132-column.  Always liked their commands (very similar to Televideo
925s in my case), and have had no problems at all.  Good keyboard (even
the old version), good screen, graphics (well, kind of) even.

Usual disclaimer - not associated with Liberty Electronics, don't sell
the bloody things, etc.  Just a satisfied user with his first terminal,
and cheap at that!

(Also hear very good things about the Wyse family of terminals.)

Try the XLATE programs in micro:<cpm.asmutl> - XLATE5.LBR (binary) would
seem to be the most current, although you might want to download XLATE2-11.

I have not used this stuff for a year or so, and when I did it was for about
ten minutes so I make no promises that my recollection is correct!  BUT - I

I have tried to mail to the origonal poster several times but I can't
get through so, if you're out there, please respond:
 
As I had asked this person, there is a said postprocessor for Wordstar
to allow column printing.  Does anyone know what it is called and how
much it costs?  Second:  Does anyone out there know of any way to tell
wordstar to take the next CHARACTER verbatem (not line).  I need that
to send commands to printer/post processors of my own.  Believe it or
not an Apple word processor has this feature and it's very useful.

Subject: No cpm+ programmers out there ?!

Hey, I posted a few weeks ago about finding a good cpm+ (3.0)
programmer's reference book, and have (as of now) zero replies.

Is anyone doing any ? I'd really like to hear from you, and what
reference you use... Thanks.

Is your Osborne an Executive or an Osborne one.  If it is an Executive, and I
 is one of the first 3000 or so -- be warned------  There is a defect in the
video board:  I found this out from a friend who took a course in OCC products
repair.  It seems that on some of the very first Ozzie Execs there is a
defect in the video board that after about the first 6-12 months begins to 
appear:  A bad diode apparently fails, and causes a transister in the screen
drive to be destroied---no internal monitor, and the repair (according to him)
runs about $145 (you need a whole new monitor, apparently).  HOWEVER, THE
RF MODULATER STILL WORKS!!  Use an external monitor (still runs about $100) and it
will work.

I hope this helps...

From my (minimal) knowledge about chip design, I seem to recall that for
a given technology (say NMOS), a single bit of a static ram consisted of
a master slave flip flop which retains its value once set. On the other hand
a bit from a dynamic ram could be made quite simply from two transistors and
two inverters in the form:

                |
               ___
               ___
              |   |          |    = transistor
           ___|   |______   ---  
           |            |
      |    |            o    >o   = inverter
     ___   |            ^
     ----------->o------|

and that the above could be refreshed by a 2 phase clock since the charge
eventually leaks. From this I can conclude that dynamic rams can be made
denser and faster than static rams (master slave flip flops require much
more logic per bit). Since the charge does not leak that often (say once
a minute or so in room temperature) and that they use so much less logic,
they should also consume less power than static rams. Also the above dynamic
ram design is suitable for implementation in VLSI.

Why then is a 256K static ram board $1500 and 256K of dynamic ram chips
merely $100? Why can I get static ram which will run with a 12 Mhz 68000,
a 8 Mhz 80286 and a 8Mhz Z80 and not dynamic ram which will do the same?
Why does every one advertise static ram as "low power". Am I looking at
different technologies (NMOS vs CMOS)? What is the S-100 standard for 
providing a signal to the ram board for dynamic ram refresh? If there is
why doesn't everyone adhere to it? I also believe that a dynamic ram 
controller such as the Intel 8203 has an internal timer which will provide
fail safe refresh. Other than that to minimize wait states due to refresh
cycles, one could generate a refresh request whenever a bus cycle occurs
and memory is not accessed (for example during an I/O cycle)

I use a CPM 2.2 emulator from Lomas Data Products which runs on CPM/86. On a
10Mhz 8086 it runs about the speed of a 1-2 Mhz 8080. It does not support
Z-80 opcodes. I'm pretty sure it is generic and should run on other than
Lomas hardware. It does not support all CPM 2.2 functions and typically will
not run programs which use overlays or chain to each other. Does anyone know
of a CPM 2.2 emulator which is complete and runs all CPM 2.2 software? The 
address of Lomas is :

                    66 Hopkinton Road
                    Westboro, MA 01581
                    (617) 366-6434

and I think the price was $60.

A good place to start is your local Xerox Business Center.  They have been
providing national support to owners of the old OZ1 while Osborne was in
Chater 11 land, and they continue to do so.

New Mex overlays for Epson Geneva/PX-8 Lap machine

	I have uploaded MXO-PX8.AQM and MXO-PX8.DQC to Simtel's
<CPM.MEX> directory. This overlay supports the Epson Geneva (PX-8)
CP/M lap portable. The overlay has two modes of operation, with the
external serial port or the internal modem as implemented in the
stand-alone unit or the multi-function unit (MFU). The latter allows
for automatic tone dialing.

	Since this overlay is rather complicated and non-standard due
to the special hardware architecture of the PX-8, it is strongly
recommended that the separate document file be downloaded.

John,

Re postprocessor for Wordstar for column printing:  I use a little utility
(public domain) called DBLPRINT or something like that - public domain,
I think from SIMTEL20 archives.  Not very sophisticated - takes the
whole document and reforms it into two columns - maybe not what you need.

Re forcing WordStar to take the next character... I thought ^P did that!
I know it forces whatever character you enter to its CTRL-equivalent,
but what else would you have to force?

Sorry, more questions than answers!

 I have a tarbell dd disk controller which ran
 flawlessly for a year (I switched to a different
 controller for reasons havinf nothing to do with
 the tarbell board) and never had a single problem.
 This was in conjunction with an 8mhz 8086 in both
 a terminated and unterminated busses at various
 times).
 
 The board handles any combination of single/double
 density and single/double sided drives. One nice
 feature is that data transfer can be either by dma
 or by pio (so it will work in systems with dynamic
 memory or other dma constraints).  Physically the
 board is of high quality and the documentation is
 both extensive and clear.  I once had the tarbell
 single density controller and when I had a problem
 with it the tarbell people were quite helpful (in
 fact they used to offer a deal whereby if you bought
 a kit rather than a&t and couldn't get it to work
 after assembly they would fix it free of charge).
 
 It can be found (check byte) for $419 from various
 mail order houses.

  I'm pretty sure this problem has already been solved but I don't remember

way I can get it to work is to use the provided ZCPR.HEX file.  If this answer

NetLandians,

I'm looking for public domain source code (BASIC, Pascal, Assembler, I don't
care) that will work with Latitude/Longitude, geographic coordinate, and
polar coordinate data.

I have some Army Aviation people that would like to fiddle with that, trying
to find fast ways for flight calculations.  (I know this has all been
done before, but they want to learn.)

I read the article in Byte Mar 85 on navigation, but that's sextant-based.
I need something that, given various ways of locating yourself, will help
to compute time/distance factors.

There's a nice 747 flight simulator program that does a lot of this, but
it's all built into a simulation, and I don't have the heart to peel it out!

Second request (for me):  I can get CDOS (Cromemco DOS) formatted software
from the USAF TAC micro office at Langley AFB, but have no Cromemco Z80
machines to read the disks (5.25 soft sector) with.

Anybody got the tricks to read CDOS floppies?  Is it just a matter of disk/
track/sector format?  There's stuff in SIGM to let Cromemcos read CP/M,
but I've found nothing the other way around.

Thanks in advance,

David Kirschbaum

NetLandians,

(Probably for a small, elite segment, this offering!)

One of my military friends had to lay in a new compass course for military
training.  It involved a bunch of different stakes scattered over the
countryside (within swamps, on vertical cliffs, typical spots).

His outfit wanted to insure (1) All students running the course would go
approximately the same distance, (2) would be scattered as much as
possible (so as not to cheat by following each other), and (3) would be
provided azimuth and distance between points, (4) all starting from the
same point and (hopefully some day) returning to the same point.

I did a fast hack in Microsoft BASIC on a CP/M machine and got a nice little
program.  You enter the grid coordinates of all the points (plus the start/
end point) in a sequential text file.  The system takes it from there,
crudely using trial-and-error to reduce "collisions" at points, maximizing
dispersion, etc.  Produces listing of "legs" each student (up to 50 students)
must follow, including azimuth (in degrees) and distance (in meters) to
a couple of decimal points (just for laughs).

Works slow but effectively.  So... if any of you people have to go through the
map and protractor routine for this business .. yell and we'll figure how
to get it to you.

David Kirschbaum

Subject: Port I/O from MBASIC...


Does anyone know how to do port I/O in MBASIC (5.21 or similar) -- you
can't just open a device as a file... I have read the documentation for
OUT and IN, but how do you know which 'port-address' to use, or find
the status of the port ?

Any help appreciated...

Jordan,

When I absolutely had to (on this Morrow Decision of mine), I used the
MBASIC INP and OUT to work with the Morrow ports.

Mine is weird because you must poke (well, OUT) a value to one location
to flip the I/O board to that port "family", and THEN INP another
location to check port status (doing various masking for ready condition),
and THEN OUT a third location to shoot the port!  Ugh!

If you have source code for your BIOS, check the CONIN and CONOUT, LISTOUT,
PUNOUT, etc.  They all deal with ports in, out, ready/busy, and you can
pick up the AND masking values there.  (Also the addresses.)

All my port addresses are low (less than 80H, naturally), and can be
addressed as integers, so INP and OUT work fine.

However anything heavy going on (lots of fast changing status), and BASIC
is just too slow to do that INP/OUTing very well.

Now if I were only more knowledgeable on interfacing machine language
programs with MBASIC... Much rather do the tricky stuff there and hand
values to and from the ML segment.

Hope this was some help.

Regards,
David Kirschbaum

As of my latest version of Wordstar (3.3 on an Osborne 1) there's no way to
do  this  in  the  basic, vanilla version from Micropro.  I think there was
someone selling an add-on program that would give Wordstar this capability,
along with several other useful goodies, but I can't remember who.

If this is something you do a lot and consistently,  you  can  program  the
user defined keys (^Q, ^W, ^E, ^R) to insert the codes you need.

 1. current prices are more like $1000 for 256k static boards and
    $600 for 256k dynamic (not quite as big a price difference as
    you have indicated.
 
 2. drams are generally denser (x4) than statics.
 
 3. dynamic ram chips are themselves much cheaper than static, probably
    due in part to the fact that mainframe manufacturers use zillions
    of them and therefore spread (chip) costs over a larger base.
 
 4. there is no s100 standard for a refresh signal, this is precisely
    the problem
 
 5. why does static always work? because all it does is read/write
    cycles -> simpler board design, timing requirements etc.  On the
    other hand dynamic has to make sure it gets (64/128/256) refresh
    cycles every 1 or 2 ms.  The bus standard makes no allowance for
    this so the memory board has to squeeze them in whenever it
    thinks it is safe.  The failsafe refresh you refer to is from
    the ram chips point of view - the 8203 will always keep it
    refreshed - not from the bus masters point of view ( to take
    things to an absurd point: you could have the ram controller
    devote 100% of cycles to refresh, which would be failsafe but
    is not something you are likely to be happy with).
 
 6. Using i/o cycles to do hidden refresh will not help much (how
    much of the bus time is spent doing this).  The big problem
    is that you have to come up with a scheme that guarantees
    adequate refreshing 100% of the time (99.99999% is not good
    enough).  The bus standard is precisely that - it places
    certain requirements on the signals on the bus and not really
    on the cpu - e.g. all refreshing eventually depends on being
    able to stall the current bus master to do a refresh cycle;
    an 8086 wants the ready signal/status during T2, if you design
    a board to accomodate this will it also fulfill the requirements
    of a dma disk controller? or a Z80? or a 68000? or a Z8000?
    or a 32016? or a 6800? (Gods reputed action at the tower of babel
    was viewed as a curse for good reason :-).

 7. If you could guarantee strict adherence to the timing in
    IEEE/696 of all the cpu boards and dma boards that you want
    to use then it should certainly be possible to contruct a
    dynamic board for the s100 that would work in all situations
    but it by no means a trivial task.

I am afraid I have to disagree with Mr Schwartz.  I have studied and
modified the code to RED (both versions that were published in Dr Dobb's).
And I have converted Kernighan & Plauger's ratfor text editor, edit, to C
(BDS C running on CPM-80 v2.2).  The only similarity is that they both
will edit text.  RED is NOT a C version of edit.  It is NOT a version of
edit with screen handling added on top.  They are very different in
command structure, internal data structures, internal code structure, etc,
as you would expect coming from two different people.  There was an
effort out of the University of Arizona to add screen handling to edit
but it was primative compared to vi or emacs (I think it was only to show
that it could be done with little effort).  I hope that this does not step
on any toes but only serves to help.

Subject: File Xfer on DecMate 

A colleague wants to transfer a file from the CP/M side of a Dec-
Mate  II  to a VAX running 4.2bsd Unix.  The VAX has UMODEM, XMO-
DEM, & KERMIT available.  He says he's tried MODEM730 &  MODEM740
he  got  from a BBS that are supposed to be configured for a Dec-
Mate II but cannot get them to work.  They work  OK  in  terminal
mode but will not transfer files correctly.

Any suggestions?

I'd looking to upgrade my Apple II+ with a CP/M card,
and would like recommendations on the best card to buy.
I've heard some cards use the Apple's memory, while others
have their own RAM (and thus can chug along at clock rates > 1MHz);
is the cost of the extra RAM worth the increased performance?
Also, will the card work with the Apple //e as well?

Finally, has anyone heard about a product for adding CP/M
to the Apple //c?  I've been hearing rumors that such a product is/will be
available, but can find no specifics about it.

Please reply via e-mail to me at:

Gerry - We have been using various file transfer protocols on various host
machines and, so far, I am pretty impressed with Kermit.  If you can get 
your hands on the CP/M version, I think that you might find it pretty good.

If you can't find it locally, it can be FTP'ed from Columbia-20B.  Let me 
know if you need any help.

Yes, this board does exist.  Just last week, I received a letter from Custom
Computer Technology about this board, the S100-PC.  It is a board which plugs
into the Compupro mainframe and is cabled to an external box containing an
IBM PC motherboard.  The interface supports I/O mapped devices only.

Subject: Reply to: wps for stride (cpm 68k)


I have not seen any good 'word processors' yet available for CP/M-68K.  Several
companies were working on such things, but nothing has yet come out.  VEDIT
is available for CP/M-68K.  While a 'text' processor rather than a 'word'
processor, it does have a lot of very nice features, including limited 
word processing capability.

Another option which is available, but hardly optimal, is to run EM80 which
lets you run CP/M-2.2 programs under CP/M-68K.  Then you can run WordStar
or similar.  But the speed is not fantastic.

----

By the way, you might want to get on the mailing list for CP/M-68K (and
related matters).  Contact:

Let me know if I can help.

Do you really want to know?.... well Ok ...

1.  256K DRAMs are usually configured as 256K X 1 bit.  as such it will
require 8 chips to make a byte and 16 to make a work (if 2 bytes per
word).  

1a.  Don't for get the price of the circuit board, misc. logic, etc.

2.  DRAMs require refresh cycles while statics do not.  There are
usually 3-4 transistors to a DRAM cell and 6-7 transistors for a SRAM
cell.  As a result, for a given amount of die area, you can only get
about half as many static cells as you can dynamic cells.

3.  SRAMs can be built in bipolar, ECL, TTL, CMOS, MOS, and just about
anyother technology as they are basically a flip-flop.  These
technologies (bipolar: TTL, ECL, and to some extent CMOS) offer higher
performance due to their lower capacitances. 

DRAMs on the other hand are a capacitor which much be charged (write)
and recharged (refresh) or discharged (erase/clear) and the amount of
charge must be sensed without discharging the cell (read).  Since MOS
devices are typically capacitive devices (insulated gate), this is the
technology which is used most often for DRAMs.  Due to the higher
capacitances in MOS devices, they require longer times to access, read,
and write.  

Times of both SRAM/DRAM are measured in access time in nano-seconds (ns)

4.  Due to the nature of SRAMs, if they are built in CMOS, then, if
there are no clock signals peing provided to the chip, the power
consumption is almost 0.  CMOS basically is composed of both P-Well and
N-Well MOS devices and generally only one type is on at a time (per
cell).  With no clocks on the chip, the chip is not changing states and
all that is required is sufficient power to maintain the state of the
individual memory cells.  It is the changing of states which uses power
(current) as sufficient power must be provided to overcome intermal
loading of the various networks within the chip.

5.  The bus configuration (s-100, multibus, etc.) has nothing to do with
how a chip is refreshed.  Some chips offer "on-board" or "on-chip"
refresh.  Some RAMS are "dual-ported" (one port to the CPU, one port to
the system bus).  Some microprocessors (z80) provide the refresh pulse
and address while others do not.


I hope this helps answer your questions.

Bill, there is no way for Usenet people to access SIMTEL20.  I can
send a few files to you via netmail but there is a limit to the size
of file that some mailers will accept.  Have you looked over the
latest RCPM list to see if there might be other systems in your area?
If you don't have RCPM-059.LST, I'll send you a copy.

Re your friend who suddenly found himself unable to access the RCPM
system at 300 baud: his unpleasant experience was caused by the fact
that some RCPMs are so overloaded with users that the people who run
the systems were FORCED to change to 1200 baud only, just so everyone
could use the system.  I don't call this a fraud, I see it as the only
way they can make it possible for ALL users to access it.  Naturally
your friend should have been given a pro-rated refund if he was
unwilling to purchase a 1200 baud modem.  Did he put his request in
writing and send it by mail?

    I tried to retrieve TUNE and SWEEP and got 'not a seven-bit file'
    and was thrown off.  Do you have to do something ascii-ize the
    files?

Yes, I can ascify them, but they were stored in binary because they
contain some LF-CR end-of-lines (instead of the usual CR-LF) that
Microsoft Basic uses for "continued lines".  If I ascify them, this
will be messed up.  Suggest you use the "tenex" or "TYPE L 8" mode in
FTP to grab the files in binary format and then download them from
your host using the binary mode of Kermit or one of the MODEM or
umodem programs.

I just received the spec sheets and data book from Hitachi today on their new
HD64180 8-bit "High Integration CMOS Microprocessor".  Having seen nothing on
the net about it, I thought I'd post a summary of its features and ask for
any experiences that you may have with it.   If enough interest, I'll post a
summary as usual.

The HD64180-6, now available for $22.06 (1-24) supports clock speeds of up to
6 MHz.  The -8 will be available 4th quarter of 1985 and support up to 10 MHz.
It comes in a 64-pin DIP with 68-pin JEDEC carrier available "later".

Features:
- Executes full Z80 instruction set with 10-20% performance improvement.

- Ten new instructions:
SLP 	Enter Sleep (low power standby) mode
MLT	8-bit multiply with 16-bit result
OUTO	output register to immediate I/O address
INO	input from immediate I/O address to register
OTIM	\
OTIMR	 \ Block Move, Memory to I/O
OTDM	 /
OTDMR	/
TSTIO	I/O AND immediate
TST r	accum AND register (non-destructive)
TST m	accum AND immediate     "
TST(HL) accum AND memory        "

- On-chip MMU supports 512K byte memory and 64K byte I/O address space.
- Two-channel DMA controller with memory-memory, memory-I/O transfer capability.
- Two-channel full duplex asynch serial communications interface with
  programmable baud rate generator and modem control signals.
- Clocked serial I/O port, operates up to 300K bps.
- Two-channel 16-bit programmable reload timer for timing and output waveforms.
- Programmable interrupt controller, 8 internal and 4 external sources.
- "E" signal to be compatible with 6800/6500 family I/O devices as well as
  8080/Z80 devices.

Now if AMPRO will just make a CPM+ "Little Board" with this chip, 256/512K RAM,
floppy controller, and ST-506 controller all in one...

I have received some messages from people who cannot handle binary or
squeezed files.  In order to make the Byte magazine files available to
everyone, I have unsqueezed some files and "ascify'ed" others.  The
originals remain for those who can use them.  Beware: some Basic
programs use LF-CR as the "continue on next line" end-of-line squence
instead of the usual CR-LF.  The ascify'ing process may alter these
special end-of-lines, requiring some editing by the user.

Here is a new list of filenames, file types (binary or ascii) and CRCs
(for those who have CRCK to check them).  I have marked the new
unsqueezed and/or ascify'ed files.

   Yes, there is a screen dump program for the Kaypro in the public domain.
It's available on Simtel20:

		micro:<cpm.kaypro>dump24.*

   There is a .com and a .doc file, and maybe the source code but I'm not
sure on that.  There are also versions for different Kaypros, just see
micro:<cpm.kaypro> for them all.

I have used a system III with a 16FDC and a persci 299b rather extensively 
for nearly a year, and in the process developed a cp/m bios for it that
put both the drive and the controller though heavy use and have never even
had a Read or Write error trap. (Which means no error that wasn't recovered
in the 5 retries that the BIOS allows for). As above it is only one persons
experience but I have been quite pleased.

There's not really a "right" newsgroup for this question, so I'm posting it
to several.  It's a personal computer question, and I'm hoping that some of
the readers of this newsgroup might just be able to help. . .

Recently, Coleco announced that they were dumping the ADAM personal computer.
Since then, the system has become available at some large discount toy stores
at extremely attractive prices.  (i.e. < $300.00).  As I am a collector of
personal computers, this has picqued my interest.  However, I know next to
nothing about ADAM, and would like to have the input of some people who do
know about it.

Specifically, what sort of software is available?  Is it any good?  Is the
"built-in" word processing software any good?  The box says ADAM BASIC is
"source code compatible" with AppleSoft BASIC -- can I take that literally?
The box mentioned an optional disk drive as a future -- did that ever come
to pass?  What about the price?  Can I reasonably expect it to come down any
further, after the "liquidator" has recovered their investment?  How readily
available are they?  Have you seen many of them lying about?  (I'm concerned
that the supply might dwindle before I've made my decision.)

Also, I am a hardware hacker, and would be curious to learn what I can about
the innards of this beast.  In particular, how difficult might it be to get
ADAM to talk to my other machines (e.g.:  Atari, Commodore, DEC)?

To re-iterate:  I know NOTHING about ADAM, and so ANY information AT ALL would
be greatly appreciated.  (Even if it might seem like a trivial comment.)  Also,
pointers to good resources for further research would be appreciated.  (i.e.:
Is there a magazine that addresses the ADAM?  Any reliable mail-order sources
for software/hardware?)

Since I don't monitor all of the newsgroups to which I'm posting this, Email
to would be preferable.  I'll gladly summarize what I learn and post it here.

Many thanks,

Subject: ZEDA & ZEDOS info

Is there anyone out there who has any experience with the ZEDA computer
and its ZEDOS operating system?  I have come across this combination
which claims to be compatible with CP/M.  It is produced in Provo, Utah.
I am trying to down load information to it, but it only has a telecom
program called SMODEM (about 2k in size, apparently unrelated to the
Modem7 offspring of the same name) which gives me garbage when I try
to logon my favorite UNIX system.  I discussing this with ZEDA they 
tell me that the default port conditions are right, but they know nothing
about the SMODEM program.

In any case, I would like to try to get something like a generic Modem7
into this system and see what will run, but their disk format is not
compatible with anything else and they can't read any other format.

Any ideas, other than dynamite?  This monster is about 5 or 6 years old.

My friend from Japan wants to do word processing here (on any machine)
but get the files onto his CPT word processor when he gets back to Japan.
Does anyone know what disk format it uses, whether it's some variant of
CP/M, or whether some other machine generates its format?  Any information
would be appreciated.

(By the way, he loves the machine and would recommend it to anyone.)

John--
The Backgrounder from Plu*Perfect Systems has a resident
background utility, called SNAPPY, that includes
a screen dump for all Kaypro models. While running a program
(or at CP/M command level) it supports:
	- screen to printer
	- screen to file
	- list-device to file
	- full-screen editable notepad to file

Other utilites include background print spooling and command-line
editing.  The Backgrounder itself allows CP/M resident commands
(DIR, ERA,...^C) to be run from within a program and provides
multi-feature key definition support.

There is a commercial program called UNIFORM for the PC which allows you
to read write and initialize disks on a PC to about 100 different CP/M
formats.  Basically it allows you to create, for example, a Kaypro disk
drive on your PC and then access it just as if it were an IBM disk.
There are other similar programs with which I am not so familiar - Media
Master is the name of one, XenoDisk is another.  For the Kaypro there is
a public domain program called MFDISK (Multiple Format Disk) which allows
a similar function from the other end, although it is not as powerful
as UNIFORM when dealing with MSDOS formats.

UNIFORM is available from:

From:rmeier@star.arpa

Ed,
	I have been using a Z80 card in my Apple ][+ for a year now without
serious problems.  Specifically, I use a Softcard from Microsoft.  It came
with CP/M 2.2 and runs a 2.1 MHz.  It accomplishes this by using a
nonsymmettric clock that is synchronized with the Apple's internal clock.
The Apple's internal memory is used.  I tried to rewire the card, so as to
double its speed to 3.5 MHz, but this failed intermittently due to the fact
that it exceeded the speed of the Apple's memory and I didn't think it worth
the effort to add wait cycle logic.
	Their Softcard has worked reliably and timing experiments have shown
that it works at a consistent 2 MHz, unlike some cards which use wait cycles
to operate slower than the advertized clock speed.
	My only complaint against this card, is that the CP/M 2.2 that is
supplied with it is rather inefficient in terms of memory and time.  Memory
cycle observations have shown that as many as 300 subroutine calls may be
involved in a single bdos call.  The operating system occupies 20K of memory.
I have dreamed of writing my own unixlike operating system, but I don't
expect that I will ever get the time.

Message-ID:  <850327225301.819147@HI-MULTICS.ARPA>

My CP/M-80 system is dying.  The cost to repair is about the same as the
cost to me to buy a new PC-clone.  I want to preserve my investment in
CP/M-80 software (compilers, tools, word processors, spreadsheets) which
would have a high replacement cost.  What is the best way to either add
hardware, or add software to a PC-clone that would allow me to run my
old software?

I can see three basic choices.  (1) Get a clone, or near clone, that
supports CP/M-80 directly.  The Heath Z100, and maybe the Seequa
Chameleon might be in this class.  (2) Get an add-on board for the
PC-clone.  The old Baby Blue CPU, and the QCS Big Blue card had that
intention, but I don't know if either are still available, or supported.
Maybe buying one used would be possible.  (3) Get some emulation
software.  That sounds like it might be painfully slow.

I am very short of arms and legs to spare keeping my systems up and
running.  Hybrid solutions, like an S100 system with hardware for both
MS-DOS and CP/M might be an acceptable variation on (1).  Any good used
H/Z-100's out there?

A company called MicroSolutions in De Kalb, Illinois has a program
called UNIFORM that will do just that.

My version of MS-DOS (2.05) has a program RDCPM that allows you to read
and copy CPM formated disk files to an MS-DOS disk. My system is a DEC
rainbow 100, but the program might exist for the IBM-PC also.

	-------

The CPT is a stand alone word processor, the models with model numbers
in the 8000's are based on a 8080 or Z80 (I have forgotten which).
The word processor software is "turn-key" in design. Word processing
disk format is not the same as the standard IBM format for 8" diskettes.

However CPT does offer CP/M 2.2 as alternate software (though they
do not call it that).  Have your friend check with his nearest
CPT saleman.  He may need to buy CP/M 2.2 from CPT to take back
with him. If I remember correctly, the software from CPT comes
with a program to convert or copy between the CP/M formatted diskettes
and the CPT formatted diskettes.

If your friend has 6000 series CPT in Japan, he may need to find
someone stateside with a 8000 series CPT to convert the diskettes
for him.

boot prom on the controller card (at F800-F8FF) and/or an MDOS disk

We only have CP/M disks for the thing, maybe an MDOS disk will boot where
a CP/M disk won't.  It seems to boot some sectors and then goes into a
loop of endlessly recalibrating and reseeking before the boot is complete.

This followup should really be in the mail, but my site has
recently been returning all my mail ...so...

There is a book by Steven Frankel on the various cards availble for
the Apple II and the CP/M system in general.(The compleat book on CP/M
for Apple...this isn't the exact title as I lent out the book and
am only sure about the weird spelling of 'compleat').

Another good summary was provided by in Byte, Dec. 1984.

I'm looking for advice from some people who have "been there" before. I am
considering buying an S-100 system running Digital Research's Concurrent DOS
operating system (Actually, I think it runs a Compupro variant of it that
they call Concurrent DOS 8-16).

The system I'm looking at would have the Macrotech 80286/Z80H processor card
in it, 512KB of Macrotech dynamic RAM, 40 meg of hard disk connected through
the Compupro Disk 3, floppies through Compupro Disk 1A, Compupro system
support and I/O boards.

My goals are to have a multi-user system which runs commonly-available and
cheap software, and which supports hardware upgrade easily. Easy upgrade
from a CP/M-80 environment is a plus.

Applications include heavy word processing (manuscripts of novels), moderate
software development, and some business accounting. I'm interested in
developing software for the MS-DOS and the CP/M environment. I'm also
interested in running some sort of bulletin-board software concurrently with
all the rest (know any appropriate software?).

The dealer is Competitive Edge, in Michigan (somewhere). They are asking
just under $6000 for this system. This would be a mail-order purchase.

I will of course obtain the software documentation and read it before
deciding to buy the system. Since I've never used anything like this,
though, (I use DEC-20's and VAXen at work, and CP/M-80 at home) I'm looking
for reactions from people who have actually used this sort of system before.
Please feel free to contribute general impressions as well as answers to the
specific questions below.

Hardware questions:

   Should I worry about the fact that the memory is dynamic? I've heard some
   horror stories about S-100 and dynamic ram. But in this case the
   processor and the memory are from the same manufacturer, and the dealer
   claims they sell this combination regularly and have no trouble. The
   dealer says that the processors run with no wait states.

   Does anybody have actual experience with the Macrotech 80286/Z80H board?  

   This is by far the best price-performance combination I've seen. Am I
   missing something? Is this not as good as it looks, or is there something
   else even better? (This system is snugly against the top of what I can
   afford to spend; a more expensive one, even with MUCH better performance,
   isn't an option at this point.  Waiting 9 months is an option, however.)

Software questions:

   Does it run CP/M-80 applications? Can it run multiple users using CP/M-80
   applications?

   How well does it run MS-DOS applications? Will most generic MS-DOS
   applications run under it? What about PC-DOS applications that aren't
   dependent on the graphics on the PC (or are there none?)?

   Does it support some sort of "loadable device driver" concept like MS-DOS
   does? Will it support MS-DOS applications that require them? 

   What C compilers are suitable for this beast? Would I end up using an
   8086 C compiler and not fully exploiting the 80286?

   What kind of utility package does it come with? Are they any good? I'm
   particularly interested in any assembler and linkers that may be
   provided. Is there a standard REL file format in the MS-DOS world (one

Because I get these newsgroups through a gateway, I can't just start reading
them; it takes a while to turn on a new group. Therefore, please mail
responses to this straight to me. Probably nobody else cares about this
anyway, no point in cluttering up the nets.

Thank you very much for your help.

I was dismayed to read the bug reports on QK20 on SIMTEL20 - I didn't 
realize anyone was having trouble with it.  I think I have fixed its 
operation for at least most of the cases cited - it certainly works 
well with SD97 now anyway.

QK21.LBR contains the files QK21.UQD, QK21.DQC, and QK21.COM.  It is
now available from SIMTEL20 as:

Filename			Type	 Bytes	 CRC

Directory MICRO:<CPM.TERM>
QK21.LBR.1			COM	  9344  E97AH

Please let me know if you have any trouble this stuff.

Here is what's new in QK21:

 o  QwikKey Version 2.1 contains a complete re-write of the 
    installation routines in an attempt to make QwikKey 
    compatible with a greater number of other programs, 
    notably the SD97 directory program.

 o  The REMOVE command has been added, allowing users to 
    remove QwikKey from memory without resorting to a cold 
    boot.
    
 o  Usage instructions are displayed if QwikKey is 
    invoked with no arguments on the command line.
    
 o  Messages are displayed indicating that key definitions 
    have beed loaded or saved when those operations are 
    invoked.

 o  Undefined key escape sequences are now passed unaltered.  
    In the previous version, everything but the escape 
    character was stripped, leaving only the escape 
    character, thus programs prepared to accept the raw key 
    sequences failed with QwikKey installed.

1.	Regarding the ConcurrentDOS-816 from Compupro.  My system
center source says that Compupro is going out of its way (don't flame
at me!) to make its ConcurrentDOS INcompatible with the Macrotech
board.  This is not first-hand knowledge; this is hearsay from a
Compupro system center.

2.	Therefore, I recommend getting the Compupro 286/Z80 board set.
It has recently been reduced in price to be roughly equivalent to the
Macrotech board, and you get the advantage of the memory on the Z80
board.

3.	About dynamic ram and other boards.  See with your own eyes
whether the combination works or not.  Usually with Compupro boards,
one finds Compupro static memory, which is worry-free.

4.	This modified system would provide VERY good performance for
the price.  Especially if you're thinking about the hard disk, etc.

5.	816 systems can run multiple users using CP/M-80 applications.

6.	For "PCDOS" applications, there's the newly available (some
still say "vaporware") PC-graphics card which will allow one to run
such PC programs as SuperCalc III (word from the same system center).
Lotus will not work on this board.  ConcurrentDOS from DRI is
scheduled to be MSDOS 2.0 compatible in the next release, though
presently it is not.

7.	C.  This I know less about, though I am not yet aware of any C
which is tailored for the 286 and runs under MSDOS/CP/M-86.  Please
let ME know if you find one/any.

				Hope this helps

    Would you recommend it to someone as the processor for a multi-user home
    computer system?

yes, but with reservations.  I had a huge hassle with it trashing a
hard disk running with a Morrow controller (HDCA).  It seems happy how
when I use a Compupro Disk2 controller.

    Are you running it with Macrotech dynamic memory, or
    are you using static?

I use Compupro static RAM.

    Since you didn't mention what O/S you use on it, these may not apply...

I am on M/PM 8-16.

    How many users do you support?

3 users

  What kind of uses?

word processing, some number crunching, spreadsheet, minimal
programming.

    Have you found a C
    compiler that produces good code for it?

haven't checked.

    (Is the 80286 strictly upwards
    compatible from the 8086 in user mode?

Rumor says yes.  I don't know.

    If you're running concurrent DOS or concurrent CP/M, would you say that
    512K memory is enough to support 4 light users?

Well, I think so.  it does noticeably slow down though.

    Are there any things you wish you'd known about the CPU card in particular,
    and your system in general, before you bought it?

yeah, though I think I would have done it anyway.  I wish I had more
thoroughly explored the possibility of a master 8086 and a slave z-80.

hope this is is useful.

A week or so ago I requested information about CP/M cards for the
Apple II+, and whether it was worth paying for a card that has its
own memory, and thus can run faster.  My thanks to all who responded.
Since there seemed to be some interest in this topic, I'm posting
a trimmed-down version of the responses I received (see below).

A quick summary:
The December 84 issue of Byte contains an Apple supplement, in which
some 6 or so CP/M cards are reviewed.

A number of cards were mentioned by those responding: Microsoft Softcard,
PCPI Appli-card, EZ2 (from Orbital in Phoenix).  In general, people
seemed satisfied with their cards; the exception was the ALS CP/M card.

I also asked about a product for adding CP/M to the Apple //c;
apparently it is sold by Applied Engineering (Dallas, TX, I think)
for $159, includes CP/M 4.0 and a plug-in(?) Z80.  I was referred
to recent issues of InCider and A+ magazine for more details.

Again, thanks to everyone who sent me information.

I use the Microsoft Softcard and it works just fine, however, Microsoft
just decided to leave the softcard business.  I have several friends
that use the Appli-card (starcard) and love it (it has a Z80B in it, so
it is faster (3mhz?).  I doubt that there will be a product allowing
CP/M on the //c, because it has no DMA (Direct Memory Access), hence,
the //c could only be used as a terminal to a CP/M computer.  If in fact
you find this rumor to be true, I would appreciate it if you could tell
me, because I would love to run Wordstar on my //c.  Back to CP/M cards,
don't buy the ALS card.  I also have two of those (the one with 64k and
the one without.  The card is poorly made, and CPM plus even worse.
Microsoft CP/M certainly is the best CP/M OS I have used.  The cheap ALS
card ($100) will run Microsoft CP/M, which is nice.  ALS's version of
CP/M and CP/M plus works, but it is not very fun to change.  For
example, I bought a double density drive for my //e, and the owners
manual gave the patches for Microsoft CP/M.  To use the drive under ALS
CP/M plus, I had to do some MAJOR hacking.

   I don't see the need for CP/M cards with on-board memory, except maybe in-
crease in speed, but my microsoft clone seems to be working fine.  I was hes-
itant about buying a clone at first -- I was offered one used a processor that
was not the true Z80 (but instead, a direct clone) but after buying both that
card and one with the true Z80, both seem to perform exactly the same.  The
layout of the chips is also the same, and the boards in general are exactly
alike.
   Frankly, I don't think the on-board memory is really worth the $260+ that
Microsoft asks for the Softcard -- as long as I have 64k with the rest of the
Apple, why get -another- 64k?  As far as I know, the Z80 can't address more
than that.  If anyone sees more advantages in cards with on-board RAM, let me
know.

I am using the EZ2 Card from Orbital in Phoenix.  Their card seems to be a copy
of the Softcard.  The standard software is not provided in this case.  W* And
DBII work as do all of the stuff, which I've downloaded from Simtel20.
I have not found a program for the Apple (in any model) which will create a
RAMDISK in Cpm.  The RAMDISK is mandatory for successful (scratch that)
satisfactory operation of programs with overlays.

A friend has the Applicard.  His only problems seems to be finding Modem and
Kermit programs which work with the Applicard.  It is faster and with the
integral memory uses Apple only for communication with the outside, modem,
printer, disk and console.

	The only way to have a Z80 card which runs at more than the
Apple's clock speed is to put extra RAM on the card which is used only
by the Z80. Several fast Z80 cards are made with their own clock and
64K of RAM on board. They usually use the 6502 for I/O and/or print
spooling. One is the AppliCard, which runs at 6mhz (I think).

As usual, I am affiliated with no one, no way, no how.

I am currently using a PCPI Applicard running at 6MHz.  This card is a true
co-processor, with it's own high speed RAM.  InfoWorld had a review of it and
seemed really like it - it sure makes my Apple shine!  I am running Wordstar
and Turbo Pascal - no problems.  This card works with II+ and IIe models, but
I'm not sure about a standard II.  It also comes with software to allow you
to use the extra memory as a RAM disk.  There is also a soft video interface
that uses the HGR to produce 70 column text without an 80 col. card.  There
is a config menu to select various 80 col. cards.  If you are running a IIe
there is one caveat - some IIe's will NOT WORK with this card or the Digital
Research Gold Card - some timing problem is involved.  This didn't happen to
my IIe however.  For more information, there is a book out containing reviews
of hardware and software by InfoWorld - "Infoworlds Guide to enhancing the
Apple II/II+/IIc" I think is the title.  This has some real good reviews on
setup and performance.

One other note - if you want to use Microsoft's MBASIC, you must download it
from another machine - Microsoft's version in Apple format only runs on their
slowpoke card!  The Infoworld review claims PCPI will do this for you for a
small fee (~$10).

Good Luck!

This file contains instructions to correct an anomoly which exists in Turbo

Turbo using the (Q)uit command.  Granted, this isn't the end of the world,
but it becomes an annoyance after a while.  I don't like programs that dork

Macrotech dynamic ram boards do indeed work properly with the MI-286
in otherwise CompuPro systems. Note that I am referring to the newer
design, rather than the old Max Board.
I would not be surprised if CompuPro screwed up operation with the
MI-286, but since the board is an exact replacement for the old
dual CPU board, the only thing they could have done was to make it
impossible to run Z80 code. My understanding is that as soon as the
MI-286 appeared, the nice folks at CompuPro brain-damaged SWITCH.CMD
so it would not run the Z80 instruction set.
Have you actually seen the 286/SPU-Z combination in operation in a
real system? Talk about vaproware! I had a SPU-Z on order for six
months when I cancelled same due to non-existence. It still appears
that CompuPro is the worst offender when it comes to vapor products.
I have seen enough of such goings-on to be using non-CompuPro software
(my operating system is Concurrent from Gifford) whenever possible. I
have been running CCPM for months with a MI-286 with no trouble.

	The latest Nibble has an for a ][c CP/M card from Applied Engineering.
	The card fits inside the case (probably voiding the warranty if it
	isn't already dead).  CP/M is supplied with the card.
	I believe the price is around $150.

	Applied Engineering has an excellent reputation. I have one of their
	add on memory cards for the ][e and it's great.

	One caution: Putting more chips in the case will only create more heat.
	I don't know what, if any, overheating problems the ][c has.

	Many mail order suppliers sell Applied Engineering cards. I recommend
	Programs Plus (again, see Nibble).

Disclaimer:
	I have no financial or other connection with Applied Engineering or
	Programs Plus.  If they would care to give me a commission for my
	recommendations, I would be happy to change this disclaimer.  I have
	only a slight financial interest in Nibble.

The multiple disk format problem is mostly one of information.  Almost any disk
formatter can be made to format for a wide variety of 5 inch formats provided 
you have the source.  The AMPRO MULTIDSK is a fine example.  I have expanded it
to handle many more disks simply by changing the tables in it.  However, 
finding out the formats of disks is a problem.  I wonder if there is a document
of the various 5 inch formats available through this list.  If not I propose to
solicit the information and prepare such a document.  I unfortunately expect to
lose access to ARPANET within a few weeks, but would be happy to do what I can.

Include the following information, I will figure out the best way to present it
when I see the information.

   Name of system and format

   Size of Physical sectors

   Number of physical sectors per track

   Number of the "first" sector (ie  0 or 1 or 16)

   If two sided or not

   If two sided the number of the first sector on the second side (some offset 
   them so that the numbers appear continuous)

   If two sided, whether or not the tracks are treated as cylinders or not (ie 
   up one side and down the other or alternating side to side)

   The number of reserved tracks

   The number of CP/M sectors per track (not totally redundant when combined 
   with the above.  The QX-10 has 2 reserved tracks but believes that there are
   80 sectors per track (both sides) thus reserving much to much )

   The allocation size

   The number of directory allocations

If you know all this is is possible to format the disks and to modify the BIOS 
disk blocks to use the format.

The products described here were repeatedly tested for a specific
application only.  No value was placed on advanced features not
directly related to their intended use.  The opinion expressed herein

other reviewers' opinions.

This is an unsolicited review.  Anyone able to disprove the reviewes
claims is welcome to do so.  This review is about as unobjective as it
can get.

	In a data processing environment, chances are the employee
with a terminal and a modem (or computer) and access to the business
computer via dialup will be more productive and is more likely to put
in a few hours' worth of unsolicited overtime per week than the
employee who has access to the same computer only during working
hours.  Therefore, it was decided that the office computer be set up
with at least one high-speed dialup line and the most economical
choice was that of a 1200/2400 baud modem.

	The modems were going to be used for two purposes:
   1. unattended autoanswer
   2. occasional use for dialout

	Testing was started as soon as modems became available through
a local distributor.  Due to this factor only two brands were
evaluated. Here is the story on both of them:


1. PENRIL 2024

	The Penril 2024 seems to be the first widely available
1200/2400 baud modem, with the exception of the prohibitively priced
VADIC 4400 series.  The 2024's list price is somewhere around $900.

	The 2024 offers two baud rates, 1200 and 2400.  The 1200 baud
protocol can be switched from 212A to V.22 at configuration time.  By
today's standards, the 2024 cannot be considered a "smart" modem in
that its smartness is limited to the ability to dial a phone number.
Placing the modem in autoanswer mode is accomplished by simply
configuring the internal and external switches according to the
manual, releasing all front panel switches and plugging it in.  The
2024 does not have a power switch (a definite plus in this
application).

	Originating a phone call with the 2024 is a cumbersome
procedure, especially in an application where the modem may be 100
feet away from the terminal.  First, the modem must be taken out of
autoanswer mode by pressing a front panel switch.  Next, the originate
baud rate must be selected by locking the HI/LO switch IN or OUT.
Note that if you set up the modem for 2400 baud, you can call a 1200
baud number because of the "fallback" feature.  You just have to
adjust your terminal baud rate after connect.  The 2024 has no abort
provisions.  While dialing, the TALK/DATA switch can be used to abort.
When connected, you must either cause the remote computer to drop
carrier or you again have to hit the switch.  An alternative is
dropping the DTR line low, but in some instances that's a bit hard to
do.  Dialing a phone number is very awkward. The sequence is
"CRNnnnnnnn<CR><LF>" so to dial 555-1212, you type CRN5551212^M^J.
Fine if the ENTER key on your keyboard generates a CR-LF sequence;
with most terminals you have to hit two keys.  Sorry, no redial
capability.

	The Penril worked fine calling the local TYMNET 2400 baud
access number, but no connection was established to any long distance
modem at 2400 baud.

	The modem is superbly suited for unattended autoanswer mode.
the 2024 can be turned on and left alone and if something goes wrong
it's the software but not the modem.  The continuous high-pitched
noise coming out of the built-in speaker may be objectionable to
some -- it picks up the strongest local AM radio station.  the
speaker can be turned low or off via an internal jumper block.

	One 2024 modem was tested initially in early November 1984,
and two were again tested in late February 1985.  No difference was
found between the three modems, even though the early onemay have been
a preproduction unit.


2. USR COURIER 2400

	The USR Courier seems to be the first smart low-priced modem
to be released, probably due to the fact that, unlike many
manufacturers, it does not use the Rockwell chip set.  It features
Hayes 2400 compatibility.  I will briefly summarize the positive
aspects of the modem:

	- externally accessible, well-labeled configuration switches
	- external switch to reverse pins 2 & 3, thus eliminating the
	  need for a null modem
	- result codes can be completely turned off via switch
	- volume control for internal speaker

	After setting the configuration switches (an easy task for
anyone who has ever set up a modem) the Courier is ready for
operation.  With the appropriate switch setting, it can be used both
in originate and answer mode without any hardware changes.

	Originating a call can be accomplished with the now-famous
ATDT sequence, except that command letters no longer have to be in
caps. As with other smart modems, any character typed while dialing or
waiting for carrier aborts the action and hangs up the line.  The
"escape" character can be used to either return the modem to command
mode (like the Hayes) or to hang up (like other USR modems) depending
on a configuration switch setting.

	The Courier was used to successfully connect to the local
TYMNET number.  A later model also was able to talk to a VADIC 2400
baud unit over long distance (Wayne Masters' RCPM).  The Courier was
also able to call and be called by a Penril 2024 and another Courier.

	As to autoanswer mode, the modem was a complete washout to put
it mildly.  Surely, hard- and software are partly to blame but the
fact that other modems (including USR Password and AD212A) work with
the same setup indicates a serious flaw in the Courier.

	The hardware used, for whatever reason, drops DTR while
changing baud rates.  The duration is so short that all other modems
tested on the hardware, EXCEPT the Courier, are totally unaffected.
The Courier will, upon carrier lock and receipt of the first character
typed, drop the carrier 3 out of 4 times at 1200 and 2400 baud.  While
no considerations were given to 300 baud performance, it was noted
that those problems only exist at 1200 and 2400 baud.  Placing a 5MFD
capacitor from the DTR line to ground totally fixed this problem.

	In autoanswer mode, the modems were used as follows:
   - all result codes are inhibited
   - on carrier loss, computer reboots, cycles DTR, then waits for a
     character typed by constantly polling the data input port
   - on receipt of character, baud rate is tested and, if necessary,
      changed

	I must again stress that this method works with all modems
tested.  The USR Courier, however, would simply refuse to answer any
more phone calls after answering a few.  No set pattern was
discovered.  Sometimes, the modem would work properly for 5-10 calls
then refuse to answer, at other times it would only allow 1 or 2
calls.  When it refused to answer, no outside indication was given
as to the problem.  The appropriate LEDs on the front panel were lit
yet the modem did not respond to the ring.  Surely, this is a most
serious deficiency and I have decided that the Courier is unfit for
use in this particular application.  I am convinced the problem lies
solely with the Courier, particularyly sonce both the Auto Dial 212A
and the Password 1200 work in the exact same environment (except for
the much-needed 2400 capa- bility, of course).

	In closing I must again stress that the USR certainly is a
superb modem and very well suited to originate applications.
Considering that 99 out of 100 modems sold will never be used for pure
autoanswer purposes, the Courier is not at all a failure.

	One modem was tested in late November, two in late February
(both were preproduction units) and thre PRODUCTION units were tested
in March.  All five units exhibited the same problems.

	...may those who have the power to change things do so, may
those whose toes I stepped on test for themselves before stepping on
mine, may those who want to buy a Courier not be discouraged.

	If YOU intend to use a USR Courier in an autoanswer-only
environment, please by all means give it a try, it may sure work for
you.  If it doesn't, you have been warned, and if it does, either
"they" fixed it or the problem is installation-dependent...

Netlandians,

A nice fellow did quite a bit of this a while ago - and his work proudly
resides at LCG.KERMIT at DEC-MARLBORO.  I just downloaded this file
(DISK.FMT or something like that) the other day, and it has much of the
referenced disk format information.

If you'd like (and if someone can recommend a good common storage place)
(SIMTEL, you there?), I can move it back up into this net.
