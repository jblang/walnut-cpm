Subject: CP/M data transfer to DOS
Message-ID: <1992Oct1.193323.15433@usl.edu>

I am in search for the easiest method to transfer data from a Xerox 820-II
PC using CP/M version 2.2 operating system to a MS-DOS machine.  The Xerox
machine has only two 8inch Drives with a COMM. and Printer port.  I looked
into the PIP.COM command, but not too sure that it will solve the problem.

After talking with a few people they directed me to XMODEM, which was in use
in the days of CP/M to transfer data between machines (CP/M machines I
presume).  I would need the version of XMODEM which coincides with the CP/M
era.

Thanks in advance for any information submitted.

Hi,

I have a Kaypro 4 portable computer, and I need the Master diskettes for
it.  I have the master diskettes for a Kaypro II, which I can use to boot
it, but I seem to have trouble with disk manipulations, and I think it's
because the II masters are SSDD disks, while the drives (I believe) are
DSDD.  In any case, I'd like to have a set of master diskettes that are
DSDD, because if my drive is a SSDD drive, I plan on replacing it with
a DSDD.

Please contact me if you can get me some master diskette copies that are
DSDD.  I'd really appreciate it, since I can't copy, format, or do anything
that uses both of my drives (I don't know for sure if it's the drives or 
the disks, I'm choosing disks for now).

Thanks a lot!

Most arcade-type games don't work well on a character screen with keyboard

MicroPro is still in business, somewhere in Northern California. 
Try to call them.  Wordstar 4.0 for CP/M is my choice for 'best'
cp/m editor because it integrates lots of esoteric table-of-contents
and index stuff along with speller and other stuff.  I dunno who can
sell it to you if Micropro won't.  Good luck.

You can't do better than Al Hawley's ZMAC/ZLNK for $50.
Steve Russel's SLR suite is arguably faster, maybe better
but will cost you $100 or so.  Z80MR etc. just don't come into
view.  If you want something really better than M80/L80, or
RMAC/LINK,  get ZMAC from Al.

   I assume that you mean ICL Quattro.  These run CDOS 4.1 or 5.1.
   (very early machines had CCP/M 3.1S).  You can write DOS 360Kb
   discettes on these machines as long as they are configured to
   have 'PC-Node' included.  Format some 360Kbs on an IBM AT 1.2
   meg drive   (FORMAT A: /4 on the IBM).

   Set the Quattro to use 360Kb discettes:

               OPTION B:=IBM9

   It may say 'read only' but they write OK.  If it won't do this
   run CONFIG, set PC-MODE on and rebuild system.  Reboot and try
   again.

   PC-ALIEN from FBN-Software in Australia can read native Quattro
   discettes (it has them as ICL Model 35/36 DS 96 TPI).

   I can send you Kermit or Modem7 for Quattro if you wish, send me
   a snail-mail address (postal address) and I'll send a disc.

The best of the games for the II would be the original Adventure game.
It should be available the bbs that still serve the CPM community.
There are other text based adventures and games like STRTRK that use
character graphics.  Some of these require BASIC to run, but that should
 be no problem if you had all of the original Kaypro software.  The
Compuserve Computer Club forum would be a good place to look.

My favorite cp/m comm program is Irv Hoff's IMP (Intelligent Modem Program).
It is available on almost all cp/m bbs systems as IMP244, IMP245, ZIMP
or whatever.  IMP supports XMODEM and YMODEM transfers and straight text.
There are others, MEX for example, which do it too.  Virtually all MSDOS
and UNIX systems 'connected' to phone lines will have programs which
support at least the XMODEM protocol.  If you don't want to wire your
CPM and DOS machines to each other, use IMP on your CPM machine to upload
a file to any friendly bbs.  Then use you DOS machine to call the bbs and
download the file.  Easy.

There are several fine freeware Z80 assemblers, the most notable of
which are Z80MR and its successors and offshoots (e.g., Z80MRA and
Z1).  However, none of these will generate relocatable files in
MicroSoft .REL format.  Z80MR can be made to generate relocatable
modules but it takes a special linker, PMLINKER, or some such, to link
these modules together to produce an executable program.

As far as I know, looking for a freeware Z80 assembler that generates
MicroSoft .REL files is about as likely to succeed as a quest in search
of the Fountain of Youth.  In other words, I know of no such animal.

Before I throw them out, I thought I might as well offer these
computers to everyone - A Northstar Advantage with a 5M hard disk
and a broken monitor (that can be easily replaced by someone in
the US whose address I have.) And an Osborne I portable - its
internal monitor is broken but it has a composite video output
which works just fine.  You pay the shipping and they're yours.
I'll give away the manuals etc. to anyone who wants them - but
obviously I'd rather get rid of the whole lot in one go.

MicroPro is still in business, now under the name WordStar Corporation. 
However, they no long sell WordStar for CP/M.  They sold the rights to the
following company:

                Trio Company

For Uwe, I have even better news.  You can probably get a copy from a local
dealer in Germany.  Contact Helmut Jungkunz at the following Internet
address: "jungkunz@doitcr.doit.sub.org".  I recommend that anyone in Europe
looking for software -- commercial or public domain -- or any other
assistance with CP/M talk to Helmut.

It'd be nice to know where you are (i.e. if you're local for pickup,

Hi Jeff, I tried to send you mail in reply to your message on FIDO, but
this node's FIDONET isn't transmitting yet... AARRGGHH!!!

Anyways, I am Sysop of TeleVideo Station BBS, (416)-507-9608, and you
can contact me voice (416)-507-9606, if you have any further questions
after I explain a few details...

The TS-806/20 has a built-in hard disk, 20 megs unformatted, (but who
uses unformatted hard disks?), 15 megs formatted. That's a good start,
but you might want to install a larger MFM drive. I have two Seagate
ST251-1 drives in a clone tower case, along with the TS-806 motherboard
and hard disk controller...  I run the BBS off a TS-800A connected to
it, and have four other workstations including three CP/M TeleVideo
computers and a MS-DOS machine with TeleVideo's RS-422 card. The sixth
connection has a TS-806C cartridge tape backup unit connected. This is a
great system with lots of potential.

For software, you can run TeleVideo's MMMOST, Software-2000's TurboDOS,
or CBIS's Network-OS. MMMOST is standard issue, and not very friendly or
capable. TurboDOS is very powerful but not too friendly either. CBIS's
Network-OS (my choice) is powerful and easy to use. It let me easily
configure it for different sizes and quantities of hard disks, (up to
four hard disks can run on *certain* TS-806 hard disk controllers), and
there is a patch provided to automatically load time and date to the
system from a Hayes Chronograph on starting the network.

Starting the network... well, its done by RS-422 obviously, and all 15
pins are required, wired straight through. Use round-jacket cable
(twisted pair will give you extended distance), standard 22 guage
stranded core cable. The workstations will auto-boot off the TS-806,
after the network has been started.

Your workstations in all probability are really TeleVideo TS-800A's with
925 keyboards... (the TS-800A, Model 925 and Model 950 terminals all use
the same parts 'cept for the motherboard), you can determine if they are
merely dumb terminals or TS-800A workstations by looking at the rear
panels: if there are only two DB-25 RS-232 connectors and the keyboard
jack, they are indeed dumb terminals. If they have two DB-25 RS-232
connectors, the keyboard jack, *and* a 15 pin RS-422 connector, then you
have TS-800A's.

I can send you lots of information on these beasties, (copies of
manuals, literature sheets, etc... and there are also bulletins and
articles on my BBS (see above), to fill in other details. Also, Sharon
Industries, in San Jose California, (408)-456-1600, can supply you with
parts, manuals, new and used machines etc... Ask for Terry, he has
helped me with a lot of things.

There are a lot of things that I can tell you that you might want to
know, so feel free to give me a ring any time (days/nights) at the above
voice number too.

This is accurate. The Winch data and control openings are for the
external second hard disk unit (MFM 5.25" ST-412/506 interface). The
internal drive came in 10, 15, and 40 meg varieties.

There are two RS-232 connectors: one for the console terminal, the other
generally used for a serial printer (I use it for a Hayes Chronograph),
and a standard 36-pin Centronics parallel port.

The remaining six connectors are RS-422 NETWORK connections, DB-15, at
800Kbps, over 500 feet, (some have run 1000 feet long). The RS-422
connections are for Networked Workstations that boot off the TS-806.
These can be any TS-800, 800A, 801, 802, 803, 804, TPC (portable),
remote workstation processor (RWP), CP/M-86 TS-1603, or even a MS-DOS
workstation with TeleVideo's RS-422 card. A tape cartridge drive also
can plug in at the sixth workstation port.

Each Workstation is a full-fleged computer, that runs the applications
stored on the TS-806's hard disk(s), in workstation memory, and can
print on local or TS-806 attached printers.

Operating systems for the TS-806 include CP/M 2.2 with TeleVideo's
MMMost network software, Software 2000's TurboDOS, and CBIS's
Network-OS.

Anyone who needs help with any TeleVideo CP/M computer is more than

    I have just inherited a DECmate II running CP/M, with an LA50
printer. Included is a Word processor WPS which seems pretty good.
    I have no documentation for CP/M or for the printer. I would be 
greatful if someone could suggest where I could obtain these, or 
where I might start looking. 
    This system can also run MBASIC and MULTIPLAN software 
packages compatible with CP/M. I would like to know if there is
anyplace where I can get this software and associated documentation.

    If anyone has information that may be helpful to my quest please 
send me e-mail.

If you should stumble across a copy I would dearly love to see it.

Mr. Karn has a religious objection to CP/M and waxes rhetorical about 8 bits
and TCP/IP when the subject comes up.  The song is to the effect that 8 bits
are dead and gone and XT boards can be had loaded for $50.00.  Phil aparantly
has the floppies in his garage but intends to leave them there.

Ironically the tcp-group has been tearing itself apart on a similar vein over
the last year.  To whit, NOS and DOS have overstayed their welcome so why use
them when you can get a 40 MHz 386 machine fully configured for $1500.00 
Canadian and run Unix with native TCP/IP.  I notice the "get out of the
dark ages" rhetoric is less warmly received when it is directed at NOS instead
of CP/M.

I think the demise of NOS and DOS is inevitable as a true operating system
that will handle lots of memory for Intel chips becomes popular.  At that
time NOS, which is as much a task scheduler as a TCP/IP package will be out
moded by TCP/IP services that are written to run under the control of said
OS.  Rumours that Microsoft are going to dump DOS as it now is known are 
starting to crop up - it may be called DOS and look like DOS to they the user
but the similarity will end there.

Hmmppph.  The uninitiated would think I knew what I was talking about but I
am sure many of you can see through the smoke and mirrors.

I have never understood the basis for the apparently widely held philosophy
of "upgrade, or throw away your computer".  The existence of this newsgroup
at least shows that I'm not alone in my confusion.  :)  I still use 4MHz
Z80 computers every day.  I've been playing with the idea of "upgrading" one
to 8MHz. (Which I may very well take up more seriously after I finish building
the partially assembled Heathkit H89 I was recently given.)  I find these
machines to be quite adequate for my computing and communications needs.

I have also just gotten involved with amateur packet radio, but find the
"standard" 1200 baud AX.25 system to be a bit too slow for my liking.  For
about $100 I can upgrade my TNC to support 9600 baud KISS mode, and I already
have an old transceiver just begging to be put to use in this sort of service,
but without TCP/IP software for any of my computers I'm pretty much stuck right
where I am.  Shelling out a few hundred dollars (or more) for a new (or
"newer", anyway) computer simply isn't a justifiable option.

I realize it is rediculous to expect any kind of serious support for every
orphaned computer in existance, but if the software already exists, it seems
rather a shame that it is not made available.

If you have xmodem on both machines, and a null modem cable to connect

I think that the 'Winch' slots you mention are probably for an external 
drive.  There should be an internal one.  Also, on the back panel should
be a 25 pin connector marked Terminal.  On the machine that I have seen, 
this was for the 'master' terminal - the others were for 'slave' or 
'satellite' terminals.

I have a couple of disks with the MmmOST files on them, but neither are 
bootable.  I'd be very interested in a copy of a CP/M 2.2 system disk if
you get one, and also a bootable TurboDOS floppy if someone runs across
one.

Correct. The TS806-10 had a 10Mb drive. Actually, you'll have only 17MB
to use. :-(

Thos should be TS800-A's, which are full Z80 systems, but without disks.

Mmmost is a program that runs on the 806, and takes care of the 800's disk I/O.
It also provides a rough form of protection, and some printer spooling.

It should boot from the HD. Press the reset button again immediately after
booting if it tries to boot from floppy.

As far as I know that is the case.

If noone in your neighbourhood can help you, I'll send a copy.

I'm not sure. I had a 806/20, but it was scrapped when the HD gave out.
Maybe the cables are still somewhere...

I can check the hardware manual if you like.

Ed, is WordStar talking directly to the printer or is it going through
the BIOS (or BDOS)? I remember having this same problem when I was
using 4.0 on CP/M. Removing all the other drivers (ASCII, DRAFT, blah,
blah) helped me.

I would like to read CP/M 86 single side discs with
an Osborn I. I know how diskparameters work. The problem
is, the Osborn I format has 1024 bytes sectors, CP/M 86
has 512 bytes sectors.
How can I make the Osborn read 512 bytes sectors?
(I was too lazy to disassemble the bios)
If I change the disk parameters of one drive it affects
the other one too 8-(

Subject: z80 c cross compilers
Message-ID: <8OCT199220281728@vaxa.weeg.uiowa.edu>

I am also looking for a z80 c compiler. The application I'm
doing requires me to write the program on a PC (IBM) and 
download the program thru the serial port to the Z80 system
I designed. This part works since I wrote a monitor program
and installed it in the ROM previously. The serial transfer
works and I transferred a small assembly language program
thru it a couple days ago. The assembler I use is called ZAS
from Z-world. However, the application I'm working on requires 
a lot of table manipulation and variable tracking. This is a 
thing that a higher level language does very well without the 
programmer having to think much about it. Anyway, an individual
mentioned using Aztec C professional Cross Compiler and I would
like to try this but where do you find it. Another mail message
I got mentioned using BDS-C with a CP/M emulator on my PC.
This is not a bad idea because I have a copy of 80MATE which
supposedly should do this. However I'm about as fluent in CP/M
as most Americans are in Japanese, so this is not practical due
to the time constraints involved. Therefore, does anybody know
where I can find the Aztec software (for cheap) or an alternate
method of doing this without having to reinvent the wheel again?
Additionally, I can also try using a combination of the above methods
by compiling in C to assembly then assembling to machine code
afterwords. The ZAS assembler creates ROMmable code in INtel-hex
format and is very effective. Anyway, Thanks for any help you can provide.

In most cases, you can run CP/M software on any old CP/M machine. There are
exceptions; software that utilizes the particular I/O ports of a certain
machine, for instance. You will probably have to customize some software to 
talk to the terminal (in this case a VT100). This is always interesting.

The DEC Rainbow is an odd CP/M box. It is primarily a CP/M-86 box with a 
Z80 off to the side running the floppies. The 8086 can ship a CP/M-80
program over to the Z80 and run it. Since the 8086 is running the BDOS, the 
Z80 has lots of extra memory space that it wouldn't normally have. I did have
trouble getting the I/O byte to work properly from the Z80, and this is the
primary reason that I decided to use other machines.

The oddest CP/M box that I know of is the DECmate II, which I am using right
now. The DECmate II is primarily a PDP-8 based word processor with a Z80
coprocessor card. The Z80 does not have direct access to the hardware (the 
BIOS runs on the PDP-8), but since the I/O byte is correctly implemented
that isn't really a problem; I run, for example, the exact same version of
KERMIT on the DECmate II that I use on the Televideo 802.

The most interesting problem that I've had getting CP/M software to run on
the DECmate involved some software that did not know how to put out ASCII
coordinates for the VT100 emulation. I had to patch the startup banner of
that program to include the Switch-to-VT52-mode escape sequence, and then
patch the program to run a VT52.

Subject: Transfer cp/m files to elsewhere
Message-ID: <BvDz5w.Ixp@sci.kun.nl>

Sketch of the situation: there's about 30 cp/m machines
'round here -- ICL Quadra, with one 5 1/4" floppy
(no idea 'bout density) and a 10M hard disk. The stuff
on the hard disk needs to be transferred to a UNIX system.

			----

But how? There's a COM port on these machines, so if
some kind soul can provide KERMIT or so, we could download
the contents to the UNIX system directly. An alternative
is to find a way of reading floppies from these ICLs on
an MS DOS machine (if I can find one with a 5 1/4" drive)
and I can deal with further transfers myself.

Would 22DISK work? I've seen this mentioned several times
here, I'm sure I can dredge up an XT to read the floppies
with. However, I need to get said 22DISK, and that's
easier said than done (really?)

Can someone point me to, say, a European cp/m users group,
an ftp site for a program to read cp/m floppies. How
'bout vaguely useful hints? Could use them, too.

If you need more tech information about these ICL machines,
mail me and I'll look it up. EMail to adridg@sci.kun.nl.

Message-ID: <1992Oct15.051931.24157@CS.ORST.EDU>

Well, I got a TRS-80 Model II from a friend and, surprise,
none of the boot disks worked. Soooo, I took out the boot
ROM, disassembled it, and wrote a new ROM to read the
keyboard and echo characters to the screen. It worked!

Now, I would like to run CPM programs on this thing, but
unfortunately, the ROM occupies addresses 0 to 7FFh, and
CPM expects programs to begin at 100h. Meaning, I need to
disable the boot ROM after loading the OS. Did the
original TRSDOS disable the ROM after booting?

Also, I would like to know the addresses of the control and
data ports for the two serial ports. 

Thanks for any help.

Subject: Big Board II + misc for sale
Message-ID: <1992Oct16.171136.13506@mr.med.ge.com>

I have a "Big Board II" system that's been sitting around and would
like to find it a good home.  This is a 4 MHz single board system with
64K ram, two serial ports, parallel interface, and a breadboard area.
The breadboard area has a couple of parts on it to enable one of the
parallel interfaces to be used as a centronics parallel port.
Also has an STD bus interface.  Mounted in enclosure with two 8"
disk drives and power supply, and includes keyboard, but no monitor.
Works, but has a problem reading inner sectors of the floppies.
You can boot with it as is, and I know the drives themselves are OK,
its the controller that has some sort of problem.  Includes full
schematic, documentation, and rom and bios source code listings
as well as source code on disk - also Turbo Pascal, small-C, and
other stuff.  Also has debugger in rom so you don't need to boot
to troubleshoot.  Asking $75 plus shipping and COD charges (COD about
$5 and it will be shipped in three boxes which may be another $20 or
so).

As somebody answered about the .*q* files, I'll answer about the .ark. .ark
is just an alteration of .arc, which is/was a common compression algorithm
on PC's.  The .arc extension was changed to .ark simply to differentiate the
CP/M files from the MS-Dos ones, but the compression and internal format are
exactly the same.  For DOS, you could use pkunpak to unpack/unarc the files. 
For CP/M, I believe there is a program called unarc available at the 2nd or
3rd ftp site mentioned above.  

To answer someone else's question about where to find vt100 emulators /
kermit for kaypro machines, I would direct them the the 4th ftp site listed
above (watsun...). That is the *official* distribution site for kermit, and
one may obtain there a version of kermit for just about any machine in
existance.

Not true. The Rainbow has a dual-processor setup using the 8088 and Z80. I
used to run CP/M Turbo Pascal on my Rainbow all the time, and the first 
thing a Turbo Pascal procedure does on entry is muck about with the index
registers.

   I assume that you mean ICL Quattro.  These run CDOS 4.1 or 5.1.
   (very early machines had CCP/M 3.1S).  You can write DOS 360Kb
   discettes on these machines as long as they are configured to
   have 'PC-Node' included.  Format some 360Kbs on an IBM AT 1.2
   meg drive   (FORMAT A: /4 on the IBM).

   Set the Quattro to use 360Kb discettes:

               OPTION B:=IBM9

   It may say 'read only' but they write OK.  If it won't do this
   run CONFIG, set PC-MODE on and rebuild system.  Reboot and try
   again.

   PC-ALIEN from FBN-Software in Australia can read native Quattro
   discettes (it has them as ICL Model 35/36 DS 96 TPI).

   I can send you Kermit or Modem7 for Quattro if you wish, send me
   a snail-mail address (postal address) and I'll send a disc.

Try formatting the 3.5" discs with the Amstrad as cpm/86 format
(this is possible if it is a CPC).
Else format the disc on a PC with fdformat with 8 sectors/40 tracks
(that makes cpm/86 format too).
Afterwards you can read the disc on a pc with a tool like 22nice
or zsim.

One 'small' problem exists, if Rainbow uses 8080 (or 8085) chip.
Much of the later CP/M software was written using the z80 instruction set
that is a superset of 8080 instruction set. Thus you'll find some software
that doesn't work. Also some CP/M software makes assumtions about control
sequences used to clear screen, move cursor etc. Still, much of the software
will work, I suppose.

Well, there are a couple of options. If you have a 1571 drive and are
using the CP/M mode of a C128, you can write the information to a
Kaypro 2 or Kaypro 4 format disk, directly from CP/M. Then you can use
22DISK on the IBM to read the Kaypro disk.

Another option would be the program Big Blue Reader for the
Commodore, which runs in Commodore mode (I believe) but allows you
to read and write IBM disks directly on the Commodore.

Kermit would be another option: it's a program that allows your Commodore
and IBM computers to send files back and forth using serial communications.
The big problem with it may be that Kermit for the Commodore expects to talk
directly to something like a 1670 modem, which in turn only connects to a
phone line. Get the two systems by two phones (if possible) and have one
call the other.

If not, you can connect two modems together (you have a modem for
the IBM?) with a standard modular phone cord, and sometimes it's
possible to get them to talk to each other. I've done this with a
1670 and another modem attached to a CP/M machine: a lot of it
depends on the modems themselves.

Sage Microsystems used to sell DOSDisk which ran on the Commodore C=128
with CP/M v3.0 and Z3Plus and reads/writes MS-DOS disks.  Also, Big
Blue Reader, runs in C=128 native mode and reads/writes CBM-CP/M & MS-DOS
disks.  BBR is advertised in recent RUN and Compute magazines.

There are also shareware/freeware products such as TRANS128, which run
in CP/M mode and read/write MS-DOS disks.

CAVEAT: For CP/M to MS-DOS transfers, these programs do not work with a 
C=1541 disk drive.  C=1571 or C=1581 disk drive required.  C=1541 is GCR
recording mode ONLY, C=1571 is GCR or MFM recording and C=1581 is MFM
recording.  MS-DOS disks are MFM recording.

Subject: CP/M data transfer to DOS
Message-ID: <1992Oct1.193323.15433@usl.edu>

I am in search for the easiest method to transfer data from a Xerox 820-II
PC using CP/M version 2.2 operating system to a MS-DOS machine.  The Xerox
machine has only two 8inch Drives with a COMM. and Printer port.  I looked
into the PIP.COM command, but not too sure that it will solve the problem.

After talking with a few people they directed me to XMODEM, which was in use
in the days of CP/M to transfer data between machines (CP/M machines I
presume).  I would need the version of XMODEM which coincides with the CP/M
era.

Thanks in advance for any information submitted.

What is listed below is what came up on my TV806/20 once I found
the right cables for the hard drive. More than 75% of the files
have a file size of 0k so I'm guessing that I'll need a new boot
disk (if such a beast is available). So, can someone tell me what
exactly I have? I'd be forever grateful if so...

I've recently returned to the Commodore and was wondering what kind of  
transfer capabilities there are between the ibm and the commodore?  Is  
there anyway ascii data transfer can be reached?  Can't the 1571 or 1581  
read DOS formatted disks?  I would appreciate any info someone has on this  
matter.

Message-ID: <9210191414.AA26270@tmpcu.mdc.com>

Fellow CP/Mers,

Thank you to those of you who responded to my query for a Z80 assembler and
linker that could do relocatable code!  I now have a copy of Z80MR-A and PMLINK.

The reason for the above request was to get the tools to try a version of 
Tiny-C.  However, I am still at an impass.  I have two distributions of Tiny-C,
neither of which I can do anything with.  The first one was distributed with
a CC binary and an assembler called 'assemble.com'.  It uses a companion linker
called 'link.com', but was not included on the distribution disk someone gave
me (he was unloading his Apple II CP/M stuff).  I was going to try and use
Z80MR/PMLINK instead, but the 'stdlib' and 'runtime' libs are of course not
compatible.  Now I discover that I do not have the source for either lib (but
I have the C source for the CC binary, which is supposed to be able to compile
itself).  So I need either the lib sources or a lead on where to find the
linker.

The other version of Tiny-C I have is the C source for a different release of
Tiny-C that I got off of the Wash. U. archive.  It is written to use M80/L80
and the .lbr file did not include a binary for CC, so I can't build this
version either.

I don't suppose anyone out there has done a version of Tiny-C that targets the
Z80MR/PMLINK combination for doing the assembly and linking?

Thanks in advance for your help.

Curt

It's _supposed_ to put out anything from +/- 3V to +/- 15V. If it isn't,
it's usually the line driver which is rarely difficult to fix. Look for
xx188 or xx189 part numbers by the connectors.

There are several fine freeware Z80 assemblers, the most notable of
which are Z80MR and its successors and offshoots (e.g., Z80MRA and
Z1).  However, none of these will generate relocatable files in
MicroSoft .REL format.  Z80MR can be made to generate relocatable
modules but it takes a special linker, PMLINKER, or some such, to link
these modules together to produce an executable program.

As far as I know, looking for a freeware Z80 assembler that generates
MicroSoft .REL files is about as likely to succeed as a quest in search
of the Fountain of Youth.  In other words, I know of no such animal.

 Yes, there is/was a CP/M 2.2 version of Turbo Pascal.

 It required a Z80 CPU.

 Yes, it has an integrated environment (edit, compile, etc.).

Yup - that's about the size of it. Like the old Commodore PET and
C64, the Apple uses a GCR recording scheme, which is incompatible
with the MFM hardware in a PC. It's also incompatible with
Commodore's GCR scheme, but that's life. I think you'll find you
gotta get hold of an Apple 2 of some vintage to read those disks.

Common seral ports use RS232 or V.24 standards for their signals. The
signal leves is for binary "0" +3 to + 25 volt. This is also used for high
level on the signal leads. Binary "1" is -3 to -25 volts, also used as low.

The use of +-12v is very common. 0V as low and 5V as high is actually NOT
supported, but it occurs... (and works most of the time...)

That's it

My favorite cp/m comm program is Irv Hoff's IMP (Intelligent Modem Program).
It is available on almost all cp/m bbs systems as IMP244, IMP245, ZIMP
or whatever.  IMP supports XMODEM and YMODEM transfers and straight text.
There are others, MEX for example, which do it too.  Virtually all MSDOS
and UNIX systems 'connected' to phone lines will have programs which
support at least the XMODEM protocol.  If you don't want to wire your
CPM and DOS machines to each other, use IMP on your CPM machine to upload
a file to any friendly bbs.  Then use you DOS machine to call the bbs and
download the file.  Easy.

(BTW: if I remember correctly, the Kypro format is the one with the biggest
capacity (400K?) of all disk formats supported by the C128's CP/M.
So one might even consider using this format [except for the boot disk, of
course] permanently when working with CP/M.)

I'm using a PD program called XLINK (running in C128 mode and requiring
a 1571) to transfer files between disks in Commodore and MS-Dos formats.
There is also an option for writing and reading Commodore CP/M disks.
However, XLINK is limited to files shorter than approx. 43K.
If you need a copy I think you can get it via FTP from cco.caltech.edu
at pub/rknop, or I might just mail it to you.

Before I throw them out, I thought I might as well offer these
computers to everyone - A Northstar Advantage with a 5M hard disk
and a broken monitor (that can be easily replaced by someone in
the US whose address I have.) And an Osborne I portable - its
internal monitor is broken but it has a composite video output
which works just fine.  You pay the shipping and they're yours.
I'll give away the manuals etc. to anyone who wants them - but
obviously I'd rather get rid of the whole lot in one go.

Yours,

John.

Sage Microsystems used to sell DOSDisk which ran on the Commodore C=128
with CP/M v3.0 and Z3Plus and reads/writes MS-DOS disks.  Also, Big
Blue Reader, runs in C=128 native mode and reads/writes CBM-CP/M & MS-DOS
disks.  BBR is advertised in recent RUN and Compute magazines.

There are also shareware/freeware products such as TRANS128, which run
in CP/M mode and read/write MS-DOS disks.

CAVEAT: For CP/M to MS-DOS transfers, these programs do not work with a 
C=1541 disk drive.  C=1571 or C=1581 disk drive required.  C=1541 is GCR
recording mode ONLY, C=1571 is GCR or MFM recording and C=1581 is MFM
recording.  MS-DOS disks are MFM recording.

I'm not sure what you are asking here.  Most serial ports (RS232 style
anyway) that I've come across put out +/- 12V (or so) depending on the
logic state, not 5V.  They are not broken in doing this.

There are some machines (C=64s is one that comes to mind) which came
with serial ports that put out TTL voltages (0/+5), but they aren't that
common.

If you still think that there is a problem with your serial port you may
care to mention what machine you are talking about, and any other
details about the problem (eg, when it stopped working).

and index stuff along with speller and other stuff.  I dunno who can
sell it to you if Micropro won't.  Good luck.

You can't do better than Al Hawley's ZMAC/ZLNK for $50.
Steve Russel's SLR suite is arguably faster, maybe better
but will cost you $100 or so.  Z80MR etc. just don't come into
view.  If you want something really better than M80/L80, or
RMAC/LINK,  get ZMAC from Al.

Hi Jeff, I tried to send you mail in reply to your message on FIDO, but
this node's FIDONET isn't transmitting yet... AARRGGHH!!!

Anyways, I am Sysop of TeleVideo Station BBS, (416)-507-9608, and you
can contact me voice (416)-507-9606, if you have any further questions
after I explain a few details...

The TS-806/20 has a built-in hard disk, 20 megs unformatted, (but who
uses unformatted hard disks?), 15 megs formatted. That's a good start,
but you might want to install a larger MFM drive. I have two Seagate
ST251-1 drives in a clone tower case, along with the TS-806 motherboard
and hard disk controller...  I run the BBS off a TS-800A connected to
it, and have four other workstations including three CP/M TeleVideo
computers and a MS-DOS machine with TeleVideo's RS-422 card. The sixth
connection has a TS-806C cartridge tape backup unit connected. This is a
great system with lots of potential.

For software, you can run TeleVideo's MMMOST, Software-2000's TurboDOS,
or CBIS's Network-OS. MMMOST is standard issue, and not very friendly or
capable. TurboDOS is very powerful but not too friendly either. CBIS's
Network-OS (my choice) is powerful and easy to use. It let me easily
configure it for different sizes and quantities of hard disks, (up to
four hard disks can run on *certain* TS-806 hard disk controllers), and
there is a patch provided to automatically load time and date to the
system from a Hayes Chronograph on starting the network.

Starting the network... well, its done by RS-422 obviously, and all 15
pins are required, wired straight through. Use round-jacket cable
(twisted pair will give you extended distance), standard 22 guage
stranded core cable. The workstations will auto-boot off the TS-806,
after the network has been started.

Your workstations in all probability are really TeleVideo TS-800A's with
925 keyboards... (the TS-800A, Model 925 and Model 950 terminals all use
the same parts 'cept for the motherboard), you can determine if they are
merely dumb terminals or TS-800A workstations by looking at the rear
panels: if there are only two DB-25 RS-232 connectors and the keyboard
jack, they are indeed dumb terminals. If they have two DB-25 RS-232
connectors, the keyboard jack, *and* a 15 pin RS-422 connector, then you
have TS-800A's.

I can send you lots of information on these beasties, (copies of
manuals, literature sheets, etc... and there are also bulletins and
articles on my BBS (see above), to fill in other details. Also, Sharon
Industries, in San Jose California, (408)-456-1600, can supply you with
parts, manuals, new and used machines etc... Ask for Terry, he has
helped me with a lot of things.

There are a lot of things that I can tell you that you might want to
know, so feel free to give me a ring any time (days/nights) at the above
voice number too.

Message-ID: <1992Oct4.212608.11506@noose.ecn.purdue.edu>

Hi,

I have a Kaypro 4 portable computer, and I need the Master diskettes for
it.  I have the master diskettes for a Kaypro II, which I can use to boot
it, but I seem to have trouble with disk manipulations, and I think it's
because the II masters are SSDD disks, while the drives (I believe) are
DSDD.  In any case, I'd like to have a set of master diskettes that are
DSDD, because if my drive is a SSDD drive, I plan on replacing it with
a DSDD.

Please contact me if you can get me some master diskette copies that are
DSDD.  I'd really appreciate it, since I can't copy, format, or do anything
that uses both of my drives (I don't know for sure if it's the drives or 
the disks, I'm choosing disks for now).

Thanks a lot!

Version 1.03 of MYZ80 was released just recently.  Here is a copy of the
release announcement that was posted on the FidoNet CPMTECH echo.

--- release announcement begins ---
 From : Simeon Cran                 3:714/906.1             16 Oct 92  03:38:14

 Subj : New MYZ80 version released today!

                      M Y Z 8 0   N E W S ! ! !
                      =========================

It's official!

MYZ80 version 1.03 is released today.


Apart from some minor fixes that a few users required, the really big deal about
version 1.03 is the completely new keyboard support.

You can now redefine virtually any key on the keyboard, even in the middle of
running your favourite piece of CP/M software!



Very soon (and I'll let you all know about it here) MYZ80 version 1.03 will be
available for file request at V32 (9600 baud) speed from 3:640/208. The file is
75k in size and will also appear soon at many other BBSes around the world
(depending a lot on where YOU upload it to!). Available from Z-Node 62 in Perth
from this Sunday (18th) (+61 9 450 0200 - 2400 baud, 24 hours a day). Available
direct from my computer at v32bis (14400 baud) by prior arrangement (netmail me
about this). Available in New Zealand from +64 4 478 3117 at v32bis (14400
baud).


Please note also that my new point address is 3:640/208.3 and I'm always happy
to talk to you via netmail about MYZ80.


--- MYZ80 version 1.03 features over version 1.02: ---
* Upgraded, improved, faster utilities.
* Superb keyboard redefinition system.
* A few minor fixes.
* Complete and up-to-date MYZ80 API information.
* Support for DOS interrupt 14h (to allow for the use of a FOSSIL communications
driver).
* Some new API functions.
* Support for the undocumented Z80 instructions (registered version only).
* The correct ZPM3/CPM 3.0 files to allow you to run CP/M 3.0 on MYZ80.


Thousands and thousands more CP/M 2.2 and CP/M 3.0 capable computers have just
been born, thanks to MYZ80!


--- msgedsq/2 2.1a
 * Origin: Simeon's Point. Home of MYZ80 and ZPM3. Z80 lives!!! (3:714/906.1)
--- release announcement ends ---

I've got ZPM3 working now in my system, and got Z3PLUS going too.  The
API document looks to be very very useful, and the FOSSIL support should
prove useful for running a RCPM on a DOS machine (a FOSSIL provides
reasonable, buffered, serial IO for a DOS machine).  The new keyboard
support is amazing - a pop up window which can redefine any key
combination at any time.

Those people who emailed me about the previous version of MyZ80 can
retrieve the new version from the same place as MYZ80103.ZIP.  I
request, again, that you upload it to other FTP sites around the world.
To everyone else please be patient and wait until it arrives on FTP
sites around the world, as FTP to New Zealand is both slow and also
costs real money to NZ sites.  Thank you for your patience.

The best of the games for the II would be the original Adventure game.
It should be available the bbs that still serve the CPM community.
There are other text based adventures and games like STRTRK that use
character graphics.  Some of these require BASIC to run, but that should
 be no problem if you had all of the original Kaypro software.  The
Compuserve Computer Club forum would be a good place to look.

Most arcade-type games don't work well on a character screen with keyboard

If you're talking about the old Disk II CP/M format (from way back
in the old ][,][+, and //e days), you might be out of luck.  I recently
spent some time looking around for such a program so that I could
convert some old 5.25" Apple CP/M disks to my IBM without having to actually
get a hold of an Apple (my ][+ got stolen).  From what I gathered by
reading comp.sys.apple2 (and from doing archie searches and finding
programs to convert from IBM to just about everything EXCEPT Apple), the
old Apple disks use a radically different encoding method, fundamentally
incompatible with IBM drives.  (I'm not sure exactly what the differences are)  The newer Apple drives, however, are supposed to be able to read/write
IBM format, but then you'd need an Apple to actually do the writing. 
Of course you could do a direct serial port connection, but then, again, 
you'd need an Apple to connect with.  If anybody out there has got a program 
that'll prove me wrong, I'd like to get a copy!

Ok, many, many thanks to the good people who got me boot disks for the
old K-4, it boots just fine. Now, only one teeny-weeny problem remains...

I discovered I don't have a working keyboard cable!

The K-4 keyboard conection is a 4-position modular. I tried an old terminal
(vt220 I think) keyboard cable I had laying around, then hacked it so the pins
were straight through (pin 1 to 1, etc., UNlike telephone handset cords) and
tried again. No go.

What are the pin assignments for this puppy? Is just one* of the pairs
reversed? are the inside and outside pairs swapped somewhere along the line?
Did I fry my keyboard on the first try? (if so, what did I fry? can I fix it?
does a kb like this exist anywhere else in creation?)

Thank you... (moan)

can't help with *.ark (although *.arc means use UNARC.COM).
*.lbr = library file (use NULU.COM)

I think that the 'Winch' slots you mention are probably for an external 
drive.  There should be an internal one.  Also, on the back panel should
be a 25 pin connector marked Terminal.  On the machine that I have seen, 
this was for the 'master' terminal - the others were for 'slave' or 
'satellite' terminals.

I have a couple of disks with the MmmOST files on them, but neither are 
bootable.  I'd be very interested in a copy of a CP/M 2.2 system disk if
you get one, and also a bootable TurboDOS floppy if someone runs across
one.

Correct. The TS806-10 had a 10Mb drive. Actually, you'll have only 17MB

Thos should be TS800-A's, which are full Z80 systems, but without disks.

Mmmost is a program that runs on the 806, and takes care of the 800's disk I/O.
It also provides a rough form of protection, and some printer spooling.

It should boot from the HD. Press the reset button again immediately after
booting if it tries to boot from floppy.

As far as I know that is the case.

If noone in your neighbourhood can help you, I'll send a copy.

I'm not sure. I had a 806/20, but it was scrapped when the HD gave out.
Maybe the cables are still somewhere...

Wordstar 4.0 in no longer available from MicroPro, but it can be had from
a company that Micropro gave distribution rights to.  I don't have the company
name and address handy (the infor is at home).  Someone else posted the infor
during the last month or so.  So perhaps that person could post the info 
again for Uwe Nass?

There are several fine freeware Z80 assemblers, the most notable of
which are Z80MR and its successors and offshoots (e.g., Z80MRA and
Z1).  However, none of these will generate relocatable files in
MicroSoft .REL format.  Z80MR can be made to generate relocatable
modules but it takes a special linker, PMLINKER, or some such, to link
these modules together to produce an executable program.

As far as I know, looking for a freeware Z80 assembler that generates
MicroSoft .REL files is about as likely to succeed as a quest in search
of the Fountain of Youth.  In other words, I know of no such animal.

This is accurate. The Winch data and control openings are for the
external second hard disk unit (MFM 5.25" ST-412/506 interface). The
internal drive came in 10, 15, and 40 meg varieties.

There are two RS-232 connectors: one for the console terminal, the other
generally used for a serial printer (I use it for a Hayes Chronograph),
and a standard 36-pin Centronics parallel port.

The remaining six connectors are RS-422 NETWORK connections, DB-15, at
800Kbps, over 500 feet, (some have run 1000 feet long). The RS-422
connections are for Networked Workstations that boot off the TS-806.
These can be any TS-800, 800A, 801, 802, 803, 804, TPC (portable),
remote workstation processor (RWP), CP/M-86 TS-1603, or even a MS-DOS
workstation with TeleVideo's RS-422 card. A tape cartridge drive also
can plug in at the sixth workstation port.

Each Workstation is a full-fleged computer, that runs the applications
stored on the TS-806's hard disk(s), in workstation memory, and can
print on local or TS-806 attached printers.

Operating systems for the TS-806 include CP/M 2.2 with TeleVideo's
MMMost network software, Software 2000's TurboDOS, and CBIS's
Network-OS.

Subject: Transfer cp/m files to elsewhere
Message-ID: <BvDz5w.Ixp@sci.kun.nl>

Sketch of the situation: there's about 30 cp/m machines
'round here -- ICL Quadra, with one 5 1/4" floppy
(no idea 'bout density) and a 10M hard disk. The stuff
on the hard disk needs to be transferred to a UNIX system.

			----

But how? There's a COM port on these machines, so if
some kind soul can provide KERMIT or so, we could download
the contents to the UNIX system directly. An alternative
is to find a way of reading floppies from these ICLs on
an MS DOS machine (if I can find one with a 5 1/4" drive)
and I can deal with further transfers myself.

Would 22DISK work? I've seen this mentioned several times
here, I'm sure I can dredge up an XT to read the floppies
with. However, I need to get said 22DISK, and that's
easier said than done (really?)

Can someone point me to, say, a European cp/m users group,
an ftp site for a program to read cp/m floppies. How
'bout vaguely useful hints? Could use them, too.

If you need more tech information about these ICL machines,
mail me and I'll look it up. EMail to adridg@sci.kun.nl.

Berlin, and it's great. Thanks y'all.

-BUT- There's no ICL model 35/36 entry in
the ftp distribution. You need to register
before you get that entry. There's the rub --
my boss would really like to see an actual
result before mailing the $100 to Sydex
(site license, ya know...)

SO -- could I ask someone (all eight of you?)
to Email me the relevant chunk of the file --
the disk parameters for an ICL model 35/36 or
an ICL Quattro (dunno if that's in the list) --
then, heck, I'd be eternally grateful.

You can use Uniform-PC and the MatchPoint-PC card in your IBM to read
these disks. MicroSolutions Computer Products makes both these products.
The address info for MicroSolutions is:

Subject: Chess problem solver for CP/M
Message-ID: <bernie.719774320@kaa>

Hello there,

recently I found out about spreading news around via Internet News, so here
is what I want to post.

A few years ago I developed a program for solving chess problems of the
mate-in-N-moves kind.
Actually, I did not develop it entirely. The program is based on an old
program written for the Sinclair ZX81.
Nonetheless, I put some work into this program to make it run nice and sweet
under CP/M, and I think it's a cinch to use.

What the program requires is :

- Turbo Pascal 3.0 ( v2.0 and 1.0 might work, too - I don't know )
  Don't be afraid, the solving routines are written in machine language.
  The user interface is written in Pascal.

I think that's it. The machine language routines are written in Z80 code,
so a Zilog Z80 CPU is required, but since Turbo Pascal requires this chip
as well, this is no further restriction.

Anyone interested ?
If so, please send me a mail, and in replay I'll send you the source files
via mail.
Currently, no english document file exists, but if there's some response
this file can be created easily.

The kindest thing to say about Valdocs was that it was ahead of its
time.  I suppose it must have its staunch adherents, but they are
pretty rare.  I always thought that it was Epson America's insistance
on sticking with Rutowski and Valdocs that brought the QX10 down.
When you look at the graphics routines in the BIOS there's some
amazing stuff in there - but I managed to find the documentation only
a couple of years ago, about five years too late...  The QX-10 is a
strong contender for 'best CP/M machine built', just as the PX-8 might
be the best CP/M portable.  I don't know why Epson didn't turn into
Toashiba after that strong a start.

In an article from Joe Wright:

JW>MicroPro is still in business, somewhere in Northern California.
JW>Try to call them.  Wordstar 4.0 for CP/M is my choice for 'best'
JW>cp/m editor because it integrates lots of esoteric table-of-contents
JW>and index stuff along with speller and other stuff.  I dunno who can
JW>sell it to you if Micropro won't.  Good luck.

A year or more ago, Micropro officially changed their name to WORDSTAR, 
INC.  I doubt you'd be able to find them by the old name now.

Does anyone have the Technical Manual for CBIS's Network-OS, version 5.0
or higher? I will pre-pay for duplication, mailing and handling costs.

Thanks!

I am *desperatley* seeking the boot prom that goes in the TeleVideo
RS-422 card for the IBM PC compatibles, to let it boot remotely from a
TeleVideo TS-806 or TS-816 (and possibly PM-4 or PM-16), running CBIS's
Network-OS operating system. Please let me know if you have one, know
where I can get one, or have ever heard of one.

Thanks!

If your serial port is a real, live RS232 (RS232 standard - there's a front
runner for oxymoron of the month! :-) ), it is NOT supposed to put out 5vdc!
RS232 works with a voltage swing of +/- 9vdc.

Yes, though I don't like the fact that it draws it's power from the 820 itself,
rather than having it's own power supply.  That is the reason that the 16/8 was
not offered with 5.25" disks (unless you had the Disk Expansion Module or DEM).
The power supply was not spec'ed to supply power for the 820-II, the 16/8 board
_AND_ the 5.25" drives (though many could actually do it).  In any case, if you
make your own cable, _don't_ try to power the floppy drives from the 820, using
ribbon cable!!!  :-)

The floppy controller in the 820-II and 16/8 (and the built in controller in
the 820)  works for both 8" and 2.5" drives.  Pin 2 on the 37 pin interface
told the controler which type of drive was attached.  If open, then 8" drives
were connected, if closed, then 5.25" drives were connected.  So this pin must
be grounded, if you want to add 5.25" drives.

Note that there is no MOTOR ON signal, as 8" drives did not use it.  You need
the type of 5.25" drives that have a jumper to internally tie Drive Select to
Motor On (the 360K Chinnon's I have do this).  If you don't have drives that do
this, you will need to create an interface, something like IBM's "twisted"
cable, to derive two seperate Motor On signals.

Assuming you connect modern day half height floppys, be sure to run the 820's
CONFIGUR program, and set the floppy step rate from the generic 30 mS (needed
for the old Shugart SA400 drives) to 6 mS, which is used by all modern drives.
This not only will make a noticable speed improvement in the computer, but the
drives will make less noise.

Feel free to contact me if you need more info.

Why not just get another Apple ][ - you can pick them up for next to
nothing, and then you'd be able to play all those wonderful old games
again too...

I used a program called 22dsk. It's on Simtel somewhere. Probably DSKUTL.

Does anyone have a TeleVideo RWP (Remote Workstation Processor)
Maintainance Manual? I need schematics, and technical documentation for
the unit, including printed circuit board layouts and circuit diagrams
to assist in getting a RWP board running.
