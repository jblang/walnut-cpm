Does anybody know the model/type specification for the clock/calendar
batteries used in the LOBO MAX-80?
Even better, any address where to buy them?

Please answer to phr00jg@technion.technion.ac.il    that has two ZEROES

According to the Hardware Reference Manual, it's a 3.2V 70 mah battery,
with wire leads. Best bet would be to pull the old one and go to a
yuppie shop that sells cordless phone battery packs.

If you want such software, look in SIMTEL's Kaypro section for the tinkerkit.
As I recall, the video routines, line drawing and other stuff is in there.
I believe the "U" ROM listing is there, or something.  Contact me if you want
to follow up.

Subject: FREE CP/M machine
Message-ID: <34472@cup.portal.com>

Ive posted this message to the net a coupla times before, and
have gotten screwed twice on it, so here we go again...

I have a FREE CP/M machine, with one condition: whoever wants it
must pick it up at my house in northern NJ. This is due to the
size of it (not just the machine, but the printer, books, monitor,
keyboard, etc).

Physcial dimensions are appros: 4' high, 2' square (19" rack??),
weighs about 75lbs, on wheels.

This is a prototype machine that was built in the late 1970s. From
the cabinet and other indications, this was for use in industrial
environments.

2MHz 8080 processor, 48k RAM (I think), two 8" SSSD Shugart SA801
floppy drives. And a front panel that would put the old IMSAI to
shame. The back of the machine has a myriad of ports, for your
standard stuff like printers, etc; and some for more esoteric things
like card punch/reader.

I have ALL the books and manuals anyone ever wants. I have the CP/M
2.2 users guide, software product manuals. And all the engineering
notes, diagrams and blueprints devolped when the machine was being
built (BTW: the machine was never commercially marketed, only about
5 machines were developed. This machine is the engineers personal
machine)

I also have many spare boards for it, such as processor, memory,
and disk controllers, and more.

Also includes a 300bps character printer, but it doesnt quite work.
It doesnt LF, and I have no inclination to try to fix it.

The buss is a propriatory buss, not an S-100 buss, but as stated
above, ALL docs are included.

I will not and can not ship this, for various reasons (size weight, etc)
If anyone is interested, give me a voice call, and I will give you
directions to my house in NJ. 

The machine works just fine as is, but Ive neither the time nor the
inclination to work on it. I also need the room. Ive recently gotten
a VAX 730, and need room for that and tape drives.

If in two weeks, I get no inquiries, the machine will be scrapped.
One week for net delay, and one week more for low-priority mail sites.
I dont want to scrap it, thats why I am -giving- it away free, but,
I will if no one wants it.

This is a machine for serious computer antique collectors or for
someone who just wants to hack around. (contrary to popular belief,
there WERE computers before the IBM PC)

The only problem is some system use only CR.  (The Macintosh is the one I use
most often.)   I mentioned to someone else that I like PostScript's mothod the
best.  It takes CR, LF or CR LF as a single new line character.  All three
are seen by the program as a single new line.  On output new line is converted
to CR LF.  This works reasonably well on all systems.  (There may be extra
characters on some systems but no files come in as a single line.)

I did, and am very happy with the two FD55 quads I now have; they were only 50$
each so I got two for the price of one!  Also, they are very, very quiet!!
Thx for the reply. . . 
 BTW I did get the info on the 1.2M drives, yes they can run at 300Hz and 360Hz
spindle speed and yes all those user straps do something. So if anybody wants
to know exactly what can be set on one of these,  get in touch!

A reader of one of my messages about the MIX 'C' compiler (for 
CP/M), which is a full K & R implementation of the 'C' 
programming language, has reminded me that I failed to mention 
the system requiremments for the compiler to work properly. They 
are the following:

           CP/M-80 (2.0 or higher)
           55K Memory
           2 disk drives or a hard disk
           Z80 CPU

I have MIX 'C' (CP/M version) for sale.  If you have any 
questions, don't hesitate to ask.  Take care.

Subject: 1581 disk drive & CPM
Message-ID: <1990Oct2.235622.27084@cbnewsd.att.com>

I recently sent into CBM for $19.95 3.0 CPM upgrade and got a 1581
bootable CPM disk!. A 1581 dive plus a 1750 REU as disk M: makes a
nice system.  (Also a 1541 drive for reading in GCR formatted
disks, ARGH!!)

At boot time, via PROFILE.SUB, I set the date, turn off the 40
column screen, set the RS232 baud rate to 300 and set feel to 0
(see latest issue of Twin Cities 128 for details), set my search
path to "M:,A:", set M: for temporary files and set the default
drive to M:.

Since the REU keeps files even over a boot, I don't copy any files
to the REU via the PROFILE.SUB. I do have a few script files that
I can call up manually to copy files from the 1581 to the REU.

I was able to salvage several programs off my old (8 inch) 2.2 CPM
system before it finally died. They all seem to work better than
ever (likey do to the REU acting as a large and fast disk). 

I notice that several public domain vendors do offer 128 formated
CPM software. Has anybody tried any of this? I see such things
as C, modula, and  RATFOR compilers as well as full screen editors
offered in 128 CPM format.

Whoa hey, looks like you might have some information I am looking for.  I

    do you have a couple 1.2 meg drives sitting about??   i'd be glad to

  nope.  they do write a narrower track.

  remember, these drives use a higher write current than the dsqd drives,
and need media with a higher coercivity.  (magnetic hardness)  the data
would run into ajacent tracks if the tracks were the same width as the
dsqd drives.   the number of tracks and the spacing of the tracks is
the same as the dsqd drives.

   what is getting to be a popular alternative use for these drives is to
use them on systems that used double density 8 inch drives.  the drive
electronics are virtually the same as that found on the 8 inch counterparts.
of course, you need to build a cable adapter.

Me too!  I would like to replace my 8's on my Dynabyte box.
Better yet, put high density 3 1/2" if they behave the same as HD
5 1/4" drives.

Subject: 3.5inch HD disk formats: Why not 11*1024

Dear ol-time OS brethren,

A while ago there was a long discussion in this space about what the
maximum usefull capacity of a 3.5" disk in HD mode should be. I
remember Dave Goodenough claiming that he runs his with 10*1024+1*512
byte sectors per track, which Tilmann Reh found disgustingly
incompatible, therefore Tilmann uses 10*1024 and frowns on Dave.

Anyhow, we were just re-writing the formatting routines of my disk
controller. We came across something very strange. We claim that
11*1024 is legal ! Here's how the numbers work out:

A 3.5" HD drive is equivalent to a 8" DD drive (500kHz data rate MFM),
except that it spins at 300rpm instead of 360rpm. Lets express that as
saying that a 3.5" drive spins at 5rps. Therefore a track contains
500kHz / 5rps = 100000 bits = 12500 bytes, whereas a 8" track contains
10416 bytes. By the way, the data sheet for a Toshiba ND3561 drive and
for Mitsubishi 3.5" drives agree on 12500 bytes per track, whereas the
data sheets for 5.25" HD drives (which spin at 360rpm like 8" drives
when running in HD mode) say 10416 bytes, just as they should.

Now the overhead on each track. It consists of track header:
- Gap 4a:         80 bytes (content 4E)
- Sync:           12 bytes (content 00)
- Index mark:      4 bytes (3xC2, FC)
- Gap 1           50 bytes (content 4E)
then for each sector:
- Sync:           12 bytes (content 00)
- ID adress mark:  4 bytes (3xA1, FE)
- Sector ID:       4 bytes (Cyl, Head, Sect, Len)
- Sector ID CRC:   2 bytes
- Gap 2:          22 bytes (content 4E)
- Sync            12 bytes (content 00)
- Data mark:       4 bytes (3xA1, FB)
- Data:         1024 bytes
- Data CRC:        2 bytes
- Gap 3            n bytes (content 4E)
and after all sectors:
- Gap 4a:          m bytes (content 4E).

This layout of a track was obtained from the data sheet of the WD 37C65
controller (which agrees with the 176x and 179x controller family, and
we assume also with the 2797 actually used in our controller board, but
we don't have a data sheet for it, since WD doesn't want to send me
one), and agrees with the ones listed in several different drive data
sheets.

Therefore, each sector occupies 1086 bytes (1024 net plus 62 bytes
overhead), and there is an additional track overhead of 146 bytes.

Now, we still have to calculate the lengths of Gap 3 and 4a, called n
and m so far. Gap 4a has to be at least 16 bytes, but most formats seem
to use at least 120 bytes, so we stick to just setting its minimum
length at 120 bytes. Now just take the total track length (12500),
subtract track overhead (-146), subtract the minimum length of Gap 4a
(-120), and subtract the space required for data sector (-11*1086).
That yields 12500-146-120-11*1086 = 288.

Now take these 288 bytes which are left, and distribute them evenly
over the 11 Gap 3s, making each 26 bytes long. In the 176x data sheets
a length of 24 bytes for gap 3 is recommended, so we are safely within
specs. Then the rest of the track (11x26 is a little less than 288 due
to rounding) is filled by letting Gap 4a get as long as it wants
(therefore in our case Gap 4a will be at least 120 bytes, usually a
little longer).

By the way, according to the 176x data sheet the limit of 24 bytes for
gap 3 (as indeed all gap lengths we used above) are already increased
above the functional limit to account for motor speed variation, PLL
lock up time, write splice area etc. Supposedly one can cut all gap
lengths in half (most gaps can theoretically be as short as 2 bytes)
and it would still work. So we seem to be far on the safe side.

Conclusion: 11x1024 is a legal format, and actually leaves a little bit
more safety margin than recommended in the controller data sheet. So,
why does nobody use it? And therefore, why should we be the first ones
to find that out?

Thanx for enlightenment, and don't start a religious war over this one.

No, it's hardware. You have to move the stop on the head guide bars
(or wherever the stop is mounted--I didn't bother on the one I have)
in order to get the extra 5 tracks. I verified that by testing (I have
one early model SA400).

     There seems to be some confusion here... the WD1002-05 is NOT a
SCSI device.  It needs a parallel port.

     Presumably this is going into a Kaypro?  You may have better luck
with a 1002-HD0.

I thought a wd1002-05 was a SASI interface!?  I'll see wots in my Kaypro
tonite to resolve this one definitively. . .   I'm in line for two more
2-84's for 200$A and will likely need two more of these interfaces as well.

Anyways, keep on your debates. . .

Subject: converting 8 inch to 3.5 inch
Message-ID: <7185@alvin.mcnc.org>

There have been some discussions in this group recently about using HD floppies
to replace 8 inch drives. I tried this using a 3.5 inch HD drive and here are some
early results.

Hardware:
In general there are no hardware difficulties. If you looked at the pinouts of an 8
inch drive and a 5.25 inch drive you will find that many of the pins line up one for
one. I happened to have an adapter board that converted between the two size ports
so I did not have to make a cable. The drive that I got has an adapter to go from
the 34 pins to a 34 card edge but either would have been ok. Two signal lines had to
be accounted for. The 8 inch drive has a drive ready line which the smaller drives
do not. In my case this line is sensed by the bios but the easiest way out is simply
to keep it grounded. There is also a signal out of the 8 inch drive indicating that
a two-sided disk is inside. Since there are no single sided HD disks, this line
could also be grounded if I was to replace all my 8 inch drives. In mixing single
side 8 inch and double side HD, it's trickier because the line is used during format
sense. I presently have a jumper which has to be removed for single side disks. One
interesting sidelight: the last set of 8 inch drives I had been using cannot step at
3 ms rates. These 3.5 units can, and are actually much quieter stepping at 3 ms than
at 6 msec.

Software:
The formatters that I have don't exactly behave right. For one thing, they are set up
for 77 tracks which wastes some 50-60k of space. They also don't seem to be able to
format up to the highest sizes (presently 1.2M on the 8 inch system). I suspect the
track layout has to be redone, since with the much smaller circumference there is less
room for pad bytes and the 8 inch format has a lot of pad bytes. I did not have any
difficulty reading the 1.44M size that had been formatted on another machine. Of
course the DPB will also have to be adjusted to account for the extra tracks when I
get to use them.

If anyone would like more info let me know.

     This won't tell you anything... the K-10 doesn't use a SASI
interface, it uses a parallel bus.

     By now you have found that your Kaypro has one of three boards in
it:
	1) 1002-HD0
	   This was the most common board used.  Your 1.9E ( the
	   81-302 ) ROM and the U-ROM are set up for this one.
	2) 1001-01 ( not sure about the suffix )
           Early K-10's have 1001's in them.
        3) 1002-05
           A weird beastie... has a floppy controller where the HD0
           has an empty socket.  The 1002-05 and the HD0 are the
           same functionally except for the floppy bus.

The problem is it is Hard Copy!  It's got alot of timing diagrams and related
graphics material.  Fine print as well, so I'll just give a quick strapping
review here now:

	TEAC FD-55GFR

		default strapping:  D1, DC, FG
		
		Adjustable:	D0-D3,  Addressing
				U0-U1,	LED indicator control
					(Use with IU; In Use signal)
				ML   	Spindle motor On/Off control
				      	(Off state: MOTOR ON * disk
					 On State : [MOTOR ON + LED] * disk)
				IU	Will expect IN USE signal on pin 4
					of 34 pin interface if jumpered.
				RY/DC	Selects function of pin 34 signal from
					drive: either READY or DISK CHANGE
		Operation mode straps:
				LG	On state is pin 2 LOW = High density
					Off state is pin2 LOW = Normal density
					(Pin 2 signal is HIGH/NORMAL DENSITY)
				E2	Selects output condition of INDEX and
					READ DATA pulses. (Complex waveforms)
				I & IS	I On state: dual speed mode 300/360 RPM
						(Controlled by pin 2)
					I & IS both Off state:  360 RPM always
					I & IS both On: Dual speed with
						maintenance of READY signal
						during High/Normal change.


Sorry I skipped over U strapping a bit as well as E2, but you get the idea I
hope!  This would have gotten me going when I had a 55GFR. . .

Happy strapping!!! 8-)

Subject: Need info for an S-100 bus system
Message-ID: <1990Oct11.201515.22306@news.iastate.edu>

Hi...Yesterday I bought an S-100 bus system that the University was selling
off.  It works, but I have absolutely no software or information on it.
The case has no manufactures' name on it, but inside are 4 boards:

1:  the CPU board.  MFD by Jade computer systems. (C) 1979 Compu/time
    there's a Z-80 CPU, support hardware, a ROM (boot ROM perhaps),
    and a USART for hooking to a serial terminal.

2:  The floppy controller. 8800 Interface Board by ICOM.  Is this just a
    floppy controller or is it a SASI controller?  there's a 2x25 pin
    male connector.

3:  Vandenburg Data Products 16K Static Memory Board (rev B)
    This has 4 banks of 8 NEC M79729-738 memory chips.

4:  Finally, one unlabeled board.  I'm almost certain that this is a
    memory board.  There are 16 x4 mitsubishi M5L2114LP chips on it but
    I didn't have a source book to make certain these were memory chips.

Connected to the 8800 Interface board are the floppy drives.  These are
2 pertec 8" floppies Model # FD511 in a case made by ICOM Microperipherals.

That's about all I know right now about the hardware.  I hooked a terminal
up to the USART port on the CPU and flipped it on and got on the screen
Z-80 MONITOR
?
and just about any command or random string of 2 characters gives me an
INVALID COMMAND SYNTAX error.  The one command that did something different
was RT which returned (* damn!  I can't remember what it returned, but it was
different *).  Otherwise the machine just sits there...

The floppies seem to work, except that I haven't done more than turn them on.

All right, after all that, tell me, what the heck have I got?  (* no flames *)
Can anybody out there help me with this beast?  I'd like to really do some
serious playing with this machine, but I've got no manuals, no boot disk,
no OS, and no clue...

Also, I'd like to expand this thing, too.  does anyone out there have any
S-100 equipment they're not using and would like to donate to a worthy cause
(me)?  I'm looking for anything; a Cromemco Dazzler would be neat, or perhaps
a better CPU board (6809?  68000?), or maybe even an OS (CP/M?  MINIX?  UNIX?)
If you have anything you think I may be interested in getting or even paying
a small amount for (and you'd be amazed at what I can be interested in) send
me mail...


Thanks a pile,

I suspect that your choices for an OS are CP/M or CP/M :-).  You
can probably order documentation and/or CP/M drivers for your
devices, but you may have a bootstrap problem..you need the system
running CP/M in order to modify CP/M for the system.  One nice thing
about CP/M is that the BIOS sources (in assembler) come with it
so you ought to do okay.  I would recommend aquiring the following
items (to run on another system while getting your S-100 up):

8080 cross-assembler
Small-C (8080 version, source code is available, I have seen it in
         *very* old Doctor Dobbs Journals, and believe that some
	 user groups have it available in machine readable form).

Interestingly enough I happen to have a Z80 S-100 system running
CP/M right here (part of my collection of anachronistic computers,
I hardly ever use it, it sits next to an 8088 system which is next
to an 80286 system, which is the most modern thing I own, and only
because the University issued it to me when I enrolled).  Do not
even dream of trying to run MINIX on an 8080 or Z80 system, it is
pretty near impossible.

Hi:
My K2x has been updated by me using the Emerald Microware system using a WD1002
-05G  REV. Y

My schematic & everything I have that's hardware docs says my "parallel"
interface is a SASI interface.  Maybe we're just talking semantics here, but
It's nice to know what the extra ports are on the 1002!  Do you know where I
can obtain specs on the WD1002-05g?  I would like to get more familiar with
all of it. . .

See ya:

   NO!

   Don't do this!  Bad idea.

   you don't want to write a bios in c.   you're only restricted to
a maximum address space of 64k, so your bios has to be as small and
as fast as possible.  this is very important if you plan to add
double density drives to the system, since that requires some form
of sector blocking/deblocking.  you do that in c and the bios will
be much larger than it needs to be.  the best tools to use when writing
or hacking a bios is either ASM (which comes wth cpm) or RMAC, DR's
relocating macro assembler.  the job is easier with RMAC because it 
will generate your DPHs and DPBs for you.  My cpm mentor tells me MASM
will not work for this.

I was thinking in terms of assembling some code on his "real" machine
and keying it in through the monitor or frontpanel (ugh).  I have seen
some nice 8080 assemblers running on PDP-11's (under Unix lev. 6).

Quite clearly you are correct, it is inappropriate to code a BIOS
in C.  But I had something a little different in mind..realating
to AFTER he got the system up.

Subject: SIMTEL20 FTP server LIST output improved
Message-ID: <KPETERSEN.12629549086.BABYL@WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL>

A change has been made to provide a more informative output of the
LIST command, sent to SIMTEL20's FTP Server, usually by a client's
"dir" command.  The modification does not interfere with other output
formats required by other TOPS-20 systems, such as STAT with args.
The output format is similar to the Unix "ls" format, but without the
protection, owner, and group info.  The order is:

bytecount(bytesize) lastwrite_date lastwrite_time filename

bytecount is right-justified, blank-filled, in an eight-column field.
bytesize is right-justified, zero-filled, in a two-column field to
accommodate a 36-bit bytesize.  The lastwrite_date is blank-filled.
The lastwrite_time is zero-filled.  filename is left-justified.

Pagecount was deliberately not included as it has significance only to
other TOPS-20 hosts, and that information is available with the
default SMART-DIRECTORY option, which uses the STAT command with args
instead of the LIST command.

Thanks to Frank Wancho for making the change.

Comments by email welcome.  Send to: Action@WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL

Message-ID: <1990Oct15.115551.13530@ccu.umanitoba.ca>

I was given several Wangtek model 54590 tape drives and what I was told
was an ADSI Python BSTI to SCSI controller.  Of course, given what I paid
for it ($0), I couldn't very well expect a manual, could I?  I've looked
around for ADSI and was told they were out of business.  I know next to
nothing about hooking up the board, and am even doubtful that it is SCSI
(the latest date code on the chips is February 1984); for all I know it
could be SASI.

I'd appreciate any information about the boards, or pointers to ADSI and/or
Wangtek.  Thanks...

Subject: Kaypro 2x Disk Formatter
Message-ID: <901015084950.ENGLISH@VTVM1.CC.VT.EDU>

Heigh-ho, CPMers!

    We've inherited a Kaypro 2x (I think: it runs CP/M 2.2G using 63k RAM,
has single-sided, double density disks (191k), and has mono graphics)
in our computing lab, which has disks and manuals galore, but no basic
CPM system disk (containing COPY.COM and the other system files).
    I have an old Kaypro 4'83 at home, and have successfully copied its
SYSGEN.COM onto the single-sided format that the 2x will read, and this gets
me to the possibility of writing system info onto already formatted disks.
    But though I have downloaded MFDISK2.COM from Simtel20 and placed
this onto the 2x's disks with a proper reboot, I've found no simple
way available to both format and write system info to new disks
on the 2x: MFDISK2 loads but won't run.  ( I also tried to copy over
the KP4's SSCOPY.COM, but this too won't run on the 2x).
    So I'm stumped and need a helping hand:  can someone send me a copy
of the old kaypro FORMAT.COM, or better yet, a copy of COPY.COM that will
run on this 2x??  Or is there something I'm missing in the Simtel archives
that'll handle this problem more easily?  Or is there some other cache of
CPMware on the internet to which I can gain access via anonymous FTP?

    RElated matters: 1) if the formatting software can be uploaded (as
an ARK or LBR, say, or even UUencoded), it can be sent directly to me at
this address on the internet.  2) Is there a version of ZCPR that's available
as shareware like the K83Z33.LBR, but which will run and load on a 2x?
Where??

    Thanks for any and all help, folks!

  actually, if you can find a cross assembler for a dos machine to write
z80 code, you'd be farther ahead of the game provided it worked much like
cp/m's ASM.COM or RMAC.

  but the easiest route (if you had to config cp/m from scratch) is to
find someone with a cp/m machine that has the same disk format, and
hack the bios.  the beauty of this is that you can write a boot disk
for the target machine on the source machine.  It is a bit of trial
and error, but if you're careful, you'll be succesfull.

 ah, i see.   in addition to small c, there is microsoft's basic compiler,
and bds c. which i think is still undergoing development.

 nevertheless, you'll want to get 64k in the machine as soon as possible,
as cp/m takes 8k to begin with, and most of these compilers tack on their
own run time code

Yes, a Z80 system is usually too small but either a bank-switched
Z80 system (with lots of memory) or a HD64180 (with lots of memory too)
could be used. It won't be that nice but the original Minix (on a PC/XT)
has a limitation of 64K/process that could be mapped to the address
space of the Z80, the HD64180 would even have the mapping curcuit on
the chip.

Cromemco had an OS called Cromix that was meant to be vaguely Unix-like.
I've seen it running and it seemed to work.  Needed extra memory and CPU
boards above the bare S-100 minimum, I think.

Well, I have three of these (Rev A), bought in 1976 and still working.  This
is  a 16K static MOS RAM board.  Note, MOS.  The Rev A boards were not rated
for 4 MHz, but the Rev B is.  About the only CPU you can use with those 
memory boards is a Z-80A, which you have.  

Welcome to the wonderful world of S-100, where expenses often exceed gains.
S-100 boards available now are VERY expensive, like $350 for a SCSI controller,
and so forth.  I really liked the S-100 buss  (I have 3 S-100 systems) but
they are not worth my effort to upgrade.

Tony Rich told me about these.  It requires their 68000 processor and at 
least one 256k memory board.  Cromemco was bought out by Dynatech, and has 
abandoned support of Cromix, so it is OK to distribute copies.  If you 
can locate the boards and are willing to spring the few bills for them, 
you can get "Unix".  I'm sticking with CDOS and ITC CP/M for now, since 
I'm cheap (that *is* why we use there things :-).

True.  I have (in the basement with a blown power supply) a Morrow Decision
I with a Z80 and 256 K of memory.  It runs a licensed port of V7 called
Micronix.  A little slow but a full UNIX system.  It also came with a C/PM

Subject: Help with Kaypro 1 / Qume Sprint 5 / Wordstar / CP/M <-> DOS.
Message-ID: <4437@husc6.harvard.edu>

     I have a Kaypro 1 which serves the word processing function I
need but I have two problems with it and I would appreciate any
suggestions anyone can offer.

     The first problem is that I am trying to connect the computer to
a Qume Sprint 5 printer without much success.  The printer has a
D-shaped connector on the back with space for 5 pins.  Pins 0 thru 7,
20 and 25 are present.  I was told by a cable manufacturer that by
purchasing a special cable called a "null modem adapter," which was a
normal cable with some lines switched, I could connect the computer to
the printer.  The cable switched lines 2 and 3, 4 and 5, and 6 and 20,
but it did not enable me to connect the printer and the computer.

     I have called Qume, Kaypro, and Wordstar about this but nobody
seems to know what to do.  I would like to get this printer working
because it would allow me to have the word processing functions I need
(I am a college student) without spending much money (which I don't
have).  If I can't get it working I think I'm just going to have to
trash the printer, so I would really appreciate and suggestions for
last ditch attempts to get this thing up and running.

     The only other problem I have with this setup is that I am
worried that one day I will be working on something important and my
computer will gasp it's last breath leaving me with important files
representing lots of work in CP/M format with no way of getting to
them.  Finding CP/M machines around these days isn't easy and I'm not
sure where I would look or how long it would take - so I feel like I'm
treading on thin ice by entrusting important files to the Kaypro.

     The ideal solution would be some kind of file conversion program
which would allow me to read CP/M files on a MS-DOS machine, so that
in an emergency I could move my files to a PC and edit them there.  I
have heard of one program which does just that, but it is fairly
expensive (about $70) and with my budget that is more than I am
willing to pay for a little extra safety.  But if there is some
program in the public domain which can accomplish this function for me
I would appreciate hearing about it.  It doesn't have to be fast or
fancy or anything - I just want to have it around to save my neck in
case I have trouble with my Kaypro.

     Thanks in advance for any advice anyone can give me.  If anyone
reading this is having similar problems, just send me mail and I'll be
happy to pass along any useful tips I get.  If I get anything which I
think would be of general interest, I'll post a summary.

the answer to this may depend of what drives you have on the VDP80... and
what disk controller. However, I for a time was part of a company that bought
out the remains of IMSAI.. and they *still* exist.

Subject: Is this a Xerox 820 micro? If so, now what?
Message-ID: <2499@ux.acs.umn.edu>

Okay, here's a hardware ID challenge:
In the hopes of saving a few buck$ and putting off
buying a computer of my own (I program at work on a IIci,
getting a machine I can actually afford would be just to pitiful),
I have bought a cheap terminal from a local surplus shop.
I wanted to get something to dial up the mainframe with, using my
old 1200 baud modem that has been idle since I sold my IIe.
They had lotz of Adm3as and a few CDC and a couple of Hazeltine
1420's, (none of which worked) all for $39. After screwing around with 
what they had for a couple of hours, I settled for an
unidentifiable Xerox terminal that had a solid looking screen and
a very nice detatched keyboard.  I was able to get it to work well 
with an old 300 baud modem in the shop, so I figured I'd give this one a shot.

Now here is the deal: No documentation, and despite my best
efforts, I cannot make it work at higher than 300 baud! Not with my
(admittedly ancient, Novation Auto-Cat 212) modem or with a direct
connect to an IBX box (on campus) capable of up to 9600 baud.  This is
nuts; it was built in 1984, it simply MUST be capable of faster
operation, and I am hoping that someone reading this knows
about this machine and can help me out.

Here is as much as I know about it:
ABSOLUTELY NO DIP SWITCHES.
Product Code (from bottom of monitor unit): UO5. 
Description: Monitor is green filter over a white phosphorous crt,
detatched keyboard, keyboard has numeric keypad on the right side,
"Xerox" nameplate in upper left corner of keyboard unit. "Help"
key in upper left corner of keyboard (where you might expect to find "esc").

There is a COMM port, Printer Port (RS-232) and for God's sake,
a DISK DRIVES port and a reset button on the back of the unit.  
I open the case to check things out: I find a Z-80 MPU.
The machine starts up with a beep and displays the following message:

Xerox v 4.04 C 1982 Xerox Corp.

     L - Load System
     H - Host Terminal
     T - Typewriter

*

The "*" is, apparently, a monitor program prompt. Pressing the "Help" key
from the * prompt yields this result:

Baud     <rate> [B/A]
Dump     [start] [end]
Goto     <addr>
Modify   <addr>
Protocol <xon> [msk val]

Looks like I could type "baud 1200" or something like that, right?
Thats what I thought, no dice. There appear to be other monitor commands,
for example, "w" yields "C1981BALCORESCOMPUTER" and some commands like
"e" or "a" seem to produce some result, sometimes an apparent
hang, sometimes something like:
m 
0000   00  <-stops here and waits for me to type a hex digit, then
             continues

After I've done something online (at @%$# 300 baud) I can reset the
machine (via the reset button on the back), get the * prompt back, and use
the "d" (dump) command to generate a nice hex and ASCII scroll through
RAM, and sure enough, my whole session is sitting there! 

Seems like I should be able to replay my session, scroll up and 
down, etc., but God (and Xerox) only knows how. Despite the Copyright
dates, the machine has stamped on the bottom of the monitor unit
"Manufactured Sept 1984." Opening the case shows a Z-80 board with
all kinds of jumpers, pins and ROM chips with "v 4.04" printed on their
labels. Also one card plugged into an edge connector.

Other fun:
The command "Parity even" seems to be digested by the monitor program,
other attempts at discovering commands yield a beep and "what?" so
I can tell what sort of input at least gets accepted. I can't seem
to make the "baud" command choke by typing, say, "baud huppho" or 
something. No luck with stuff like "set" or "VT100" (it was worth a
try at least!).

Typewriter mode lets me type on the screen, and I assume, would pass
characters through to a printer if attatched. L for Load system
results in a hang, I assume it is trying to boot from floppy drives
which, of course, I have not. After entering typewriter mode or
host terminal mode I get the message "ctl-esc to exit", which takes
me back to the "*" prompt.

So the bottom line is, What do I have here besides a fun little Z-80
micro and part time extremely dumb, 300 baud terminal?
Screen sure is solid, keyboard very nice, it's pleasant enough to _use_
but working at 300 baud is driving me nuts!

Does anybody know anything about my mysterious Xerox UO5?

If you do, please email me at:

hughes@ux.acs.umn.edu

Since this is a Z-80 machine, it must have run CP/M, and I have
recently heard that it may in fact be a Xerox 820 microcomputer.
If this is so, I would be very interested in buying a copy
of the users manual from someone. I don't think I would be
interested in disk drives, etc, but I would be intersted in
discovering if the ROM host terminal mode supports some kind
of terminal emulation, or if it will allow me to set parity, stop
bits, etc..

I've got to believe that someone reading comp.os.cpm has used this
machine!

Any help at all would by much appreciated.  Thanks!

Message-ID: <1087@iceman.jcu.oz>

Sites for CP/M PD software:
  of course, there is the classic:  WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL, 26.2.0.74, which
has mountains of CP/M stuff.  Closer to the original inquirer, whom I noticed
was from MCNC, is site 128.109.153.4, ccvax.cc.ncsu.edu, which also has
quite a bit of PD CP/M stuff.  To use the ncsu system, it's best to telnet to
it, when it asks for a userid tell it PUBLIC--this gets you into a bbs.  it
is also possible to use anonymous ftp to retrieve  files from it,
but it has some sort of VAX/VMS? directory structure that makes it difficult to
decide what directory to ask for.

You have a full-fledged 820-II Xerox CP/M computer which, of course,
needs disk drives (8" or 5" to work and a floppy card inside).

No.  You would THINK it should do that, and I agree.  However, Xerox
uses a hardware chip to set baud rate which takes a 4-bit value.
Xerox did not map this, so Baud rate works with values from "0" to "F".

Now, if memory serves me right, "5" is 300 baud, "7" is 1200 baud, "E" (or is
it "D") is 9600 baud.  I don't remember all the others in between, but you
get the idea.  Obviously, don't use the quotes, just the letter/number.

There is an ADM-3A compatible video there, but it is NOT just a terminal
that is widely configurable.  Have fun...

  Greg,
   We do this more or less all the time.  Which versions of kermit are 
you using (VAX and CP/M machine), what type of files are trying to 
transfer (text or otherwise ("binary")), and what are the symptoms of 
"not handling it"?
   Most problems in dealing with VMS (Bliss) kermit arise from failure 
to use SET FILE BINARY when trying to transfer non-text files, perceived 
parity differences between the two kermits, etc.

Not exactly.  I tried using z80mu to write a zmd overlay.  I could
assemble it but the loader barfed under the emulator.  Z80MU does
not support such things as setting the DMA address for cp/m, among
other things.  if anybody knows of another emulator that works like
z80mu (user interface) but does a better emulation, i'd appreciate
hearing from you.

Try changing directory to PD2:<CPM.C128> and doing a DIR

SIMTEL20 is a TOPS-20 machine (I think - corrections welcome), and the
general layout of a directory is PD2:<DIR.SUBDIR>. You may be able to
CWD to PD2:<CPM> to get a list of the subdirs. Also there are several
upper level directories (The bit before the period), the ones I know
are CPM, and SIGM which are the CP/M and SIG/M archives, but I think
there are ones for MS-DOS, MISC stuff and maybe UNIX.

I've cross posted this to comp.os.cpm, but redirected followups back to
comp.sys.cbm - if there are any CP/M'ers out there that can provide better
(or even correct :-) ) information, it would be very welcome indeed.

Hope this helps;

Qume hookup to Kaypro1 should require a direct cable with the following pins:

		1<-------------------------------------->1
		2<-------------------------------------->2
	 	3<-------------------------------------->3
		4<-------------------------------------->4
		5<-------------------------------------->5
		6<-------------------------------------->6
		7<-------------------------------------->7

	       20<-------------------------------------->20

(note: pin 8 is questionable, but I have always used it in my connection from
my Intertec Compustar VPU-30's to the Qume Sprint 5 printers).

The switches under the front cover of the Qume is probably where the problem 
lies.  The setup for the twin bank switches (that exist under the full front
panel model of the Qume Sprint 5) are as follows:

	 v vv vv		v vvvvv


As you can see, I am using mark for parity, no modem, full duplex, st-off,
and 1200 bits per second on the A bank.  B bank gives me xon/xoff handshake,
and auto bi-direction on (if my printer has twintellect installed in it.)

You will have to play with the serial port settings for your Kaypro1.  A 
The manual on the system will tell you how to set the output ports to use 
the serial printer port instead of the parallel printer port.  I believe
the local setup is something like stat slp:=tty: if I remember correct.
(I may be wrong, so don't quote me.)  Once the Kaypro is using the serial 
printer port, and the cable is correct, it "should be" easy.  If necessary,
I can bring my K1 to work and try it.  After that, a  serial cable with the
above listed leads should give you print on the printer.  

Transfer of files from the Kaypro1 disk to IBM is very easily accomplished 
using the 22Disk program that is share ware and available from
WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL public domain archives.  It stored under the MSDOS
archives, and is a fully operational system.  The writers ask you to register
your copy with them by paying a $25.00 registration fee, which gets you a 
copy without the advertising that is in the download version.  It does work 
very well, and is worth the support.

If I can be of assistance in the future, let me know.

Damn, i should have been thinking....
 
     was that card in the edge connector by any chance the monitor
electronics???   does the main board have a card edge connector on it??
 
     better yet, look on the cpu board for these numbers:
 
                   either    140P82629A
                       or    140P82664A
 
     if it has either of those 2 numbers, then you have an 820 and
are in luck.  
 
     820-I machines do not have an edge connector on the main board.

   it is.  baud rate generator is located at port 00H, write only.
you can write to this with the monitor, using the "o" command.  syntax
is  o port, data  .   all values must be entered in hex.
 
                          Baud rate table
                          00  =  50 baud
                          01  =  75 baud
                          02  = 110 baud
                          03  = 134.5 baud   (very odd)
                          04  = 150 baud
                          05  = 300 baud
                          06  = 600 baud
                          07  = 1200 baud
                          08  = 1800 baud
                          09  = 2000 baud
                          0A  = 2400 baud
                          0B  = 3600 baud
                          0C  = 4800 baud
                          0D  = 7200 baud
                          0E  = 9600 baud
                          0F  = 19.2 Kbaud

  that command allows you to enter a specified value into any memory
location.   if your monitor doesn't support the o command, you will need
to enter the instructions to change baud rate into memory, and use the
goto command to execute it.
 
  perhaps the baud command would work if you entered just the b.

         ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
    That's the givaway that it's not an 820 - I.   i wish i could help
you more, but the only info i have is for the -I machines, and your machine
is mostly likely a -II.  the baud rate generators are the same in each
machine, so you should be able to use the table above to select baud rates.

   your best bet would be to find someone with a similar machine, get some
disk drives and make a boot disk.   run cp/m and use a terminal emulator.
by the way, the 820 machines emulate an adm 3a directly.

   It's really a fine cp/m machine.  although it probably has seen its
better days, using it as merely a dumb terminal is a waste of resources.
Find some disk drives (i think it can handle both 8 inch and 5 inch,
check the controller chip.  if it's a 1771, your stuck at single density
and (practically) 8 inch drives, if it's a 179x you can use either.)
and enjoy the machine for what it is.
 
   they work great as a bbs host...  :)

Subject: Kaypro - Qume connection
Message-ID: <0093E7F2C0665420.00000111@dcs.simpact.com>

Reference the recent Kaypro-Qume connection problems, the definition of
RS-232 is a connection that never works first time, and always works in
the end.
 
You need the following book:
  The RS-232 Solution - Joe Campbell - Sybex

which is a good practical reference and also deals specifically with
interfacing a Kaypro to an MX100, which might be some help.  With this
book, debugging an unkown interface takes between 30 seconds and 4 hours;
certainly I've never had a failure yet, and I'm no sort of expert.

Good luck - Will

It requires *bunches* of bank select memory, but I distinctly remember
seeing a friend run Cromemco's CROMIX on a 4MHz Z80 cpu (I think it was
a Cromemco "ZPU"???).   Don't remember much about performance or function,
however.

Re: 820-I/II identification

It does sound like you have a -II, not a -I.  You should have
several options.  From the monitor when you turn on the system,
does the machine give three choices (load, typewriter, terminal host?)?
If so, it is a -II.  To set baud rate, you can use a monitor command
"B" in the following manner: B 7 A (Baud 7=1200 bps port=A).  B A A will

You may also be able to find some cheap 8" or 5.25" drives at a local
Xerox Store or via a Xerox oriented BBS, and then run CP/M software.

It is - no doubt at all - an 820-II.  They have two edge connectors on
them.  One (which is in use) is either for the floppy controller or
hard disk controller.  The other is for an 8088 card which, in turn, can talk
to an expansion box which can have all other kinds of goodies.

Most stock 820-II have the floppy card.  Look at the main 40-pin chip on this
small card; if it is a 1797, it is the floppy.  If it is a Z80-PIO, then it
is the hard disk controller.

Hummm - this got me to thinking about the QTERM patch for a Kaypro, which
is based on the "good 'ol" Ferguson Big Board [1], just like the Xerox 820
was. So I pulled the baud rate table from the Kaypro patch, and guess what:

b38400:	db	0,no		;  38400 baud
b19200:	db	0xf,yes		;  19200
b9600:	db	0xe,yes		;   9600
b4800:	db	0xc,yes		;   4800
b2400:	db	0xa,yes		;   2400
b1200:	db	7,yes		;   1200
b600:	db	6,yes		;    600
b300:	db	5,yes		;    300 baud

Yup. 5 is 300, 7 is 1200, and e is 9600. Try the others in between, and let
us know what happens. Enquiring minds want to know!

[1] I don't know the _EXACT_ history of the Big Board, Kaypro, and Xerox
machines, but the QTERM patches for these are as close to identical as makes
no difference. I remember hearing that they all started from a common
ancestor, I'm only 99% sure it was the Big Board (version 2 I think). If
anyone wants to provide a full history feel free to correct what I've said
above.

Cromix requires Cromemco's dual CPU card, and the OS itself runs on the
68000 CPU only.  You could run multiple CDOS sessions time-sliced on the
Z80 CPU.  (CDOS is/was their CP/M clone).

	This is true *only* for the 68K Cromix. They also sold a Z80
Cromix that one could run on a System 2 with several additional
banks of memory. As one might imagine, the Z80 version was, even on
a good day, a *dog*. I think the OS stabilized at aroung release 30.

>68000 CPU only.  You could run multiple CDOS sessions time-sliced on the

	The 68K version also supported a CDOS simulator. This made
things fairly nice, since one could execute programs without regard
to what CPU (680[00,01,02] or Z80) or OS (CROMIX or CDOS)  they were
intended for. The loader would figure things out, and fire up the
appropriate CPU.

All told, the Cromemcos were *not* bad products. From the start (and
they *were* at the forefront with the S-100 bus), the products were
well-engineered, and pretty solid. Save for a few incorrect
marketing decisions, they might have been a major player yet.

You and me both.  I've heard that Joan Riff has great contempt

cataclysmically expensive.  I personally would not pay for her
stuff because that software is not worth $150, and why penalize

A friend of mine just acquired an old intertec superbrain, and he'd like
to decide if it's worth keeping.  Does anyone have any info relating
to this beast?  (I dug up an ad for it in the Nov. '79 issue of Byte)
They mention 32k or 64k versions.  What are the different model/feature #'s?
What disk format does it use?  I've got a Xerox 820-I that I could hook
a 5.25" drive to if it'll use what the '820 can write, or more conveniently,
if there's a PC program around that'll read/write the correct format...
Is there a user's group around somewhere (I don't remember- does micro 
cornucopia cover this one?) that still exists?  He just has the machine - 
no disks or doc, so any help (like a boot disk??) would be greatly appreciated.

(Email replies to me and I'll get the info to him)

Thanks!

Message-ID: <775@public.BTR.COM>

The correct command line to configure the kaypro for serial printer
is STAT lst: = tty:
to reconfigure for a parallel printer it would be
STAT lst: = lpt:

You can also make it automatic on startup by using  CONFIG (if you have it)
BEWARE of changing  con: using CONFIG. test it first using STAT.
CONFIG saves the changes to the current boot disk.

at least on my kaypro 10, I can set con: = tty: and use a teletype or
a crt for a remote terminal.

you can use STAT dev: to show what is currently set for I/O.

Message-ID: <38642@ut-emx.uucp>

I am attempting to use the unix dd command to read
a Kaypro II diskette.  Has anyone done this before and
if so, what are the proper parameters.  The Kaypro 
diskette has the following configuration

512 bytes/sector
40 sectors/track
8 sectors/block
block size=1K
disk size = 191K (usable space)
extents/entry = 1
# of disk blocks total = 195
max directory entries=64
double density

I am trying to read this on a Compaq 386/33 running
Interactive Systems Unix.  What I hope to come up
with is a copy of the disk image on the hard disk that
I can then use to play around with and read some data 
off of the diskettes.

Thanks , Mike

The one thing I'll say for her company is that they write some of the most
sarcastic docs I have ever read.  I like z80mu, but didn't want to shell out

   what do i expect from an emulator??   an emulation that works.  granted
it is free software (virtually) so i can't beef much, but all the DMA
address in cp/m does is tell the operating system where the next disk
operating is supposed to read/load the data from/to.

   this is used quite a bit in some utilities.  when loading a file 
for processing, the application reads in a disk block, increments
the DMA address by 128, and reads the next one, and so on.  it's a 
bit faster than doing a read/block move approach.
 
   as far as emulating a z80, it does a good job.  emulating cp/m is
another story.
 


  And now for something completely different...
 
  I have a california computer systems s100 machine that i am trying
to get back into working order.  it has three boards, a model 2810 Z80
cpu, a model 2065 64k RAM board, and a model 2422 Disk controller board.

  My problem is:
 
      What is the power-on jump address supposed to be set at so the
coldstart rom will be executed??  when i got the board it was set at
0000H, which didn't work.  I have no documentation with this machine,
so i don't want to resort to the trial and error method, checking all
65536 addresses, although by educated guesses it could be narrowed down 
to 512 or so.
 
      Also, if anyone else out there has a machine like this one,
would i be able to get a copy of the boot disk??  i have a bios
listing for this system, but don't want to go through the hassle of
building cp/m onto a floppy, and also the only machine i have here
(with 8 inch drives) is a tandy model 12, which has an ersatz cp/m
implementation.   (doesn't support movcpm and sysgen, which are a 
necessity for this type of port.)
 
   and another request...  i also have a kaypro 2 (1983), and i need
a boot disk for it.

I need the driver for the AppliCard to use the SVA ZVX4 8" disk controller in 
machine-executable form.

I have the '.A65' assembly source but have neither the 'A65' assembler nor the 
'MAKEDVR' program required to assemble and link it.  (I would also need DRI's 
LINK, but I think MS's Link-80 can substitute).

If anyone can supply me with the assembled and linked '.DVR' file, then please 
do so.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

else if
  anyone can supply me with the 'A65' assembler and 'MAKEDVR' && 'LINK', then
  please do so

else
  teach me more about the structure of AppliCard drivers and I may be able to 
  hand-assemble it. (I am having trouble making sense of the relocation bitmaps 
  which follow the actual driver code.  The bytes I think it means to alter for 
  relocating don't seem to make sense when compared to the source code.

Hi: (again) 

The version is 5.2b just to whet yer appetite. . .
I think we got it from the news system uuencoded!?  Must go ask, I forgot.

I wouldn't mind either.  But I still have problems with Joan
Riff's expecting some huge amount of money.  I mean seriously, is
Z80MU worth $150?  22NICE seems to be just that, NICE, and it's

Ross Alford wrote recently about how this site (128.109.153.4)
had CP/M software.  I am greatful for that but I cannot  seem
to retrieve any of it.  Could someone, who has done it, explain to
me how to FTP to this site.  Anonymous doesn't let me log in.

Any help?

Not liking Joan's attitude as a reason for using and not paying for her
CP/M and Z80 emulation package sounds like a rather convenient
justification for taking advantage and saving bucks. If you feel you can't
use her stuff in good conscience, don't use it at all. That's like saying
it's OK to rob banks because some of them invest in South Africa! Sheesh.

Actually version 3.10 of Z80MU is officially marked "public domain", so
one can use it with a clear conscience. If you have a V20 chip, I posted
to GENIE and SIMTEL20 a package in Turbo Pascal that emulates a CP/M
environment. It goes to more trouble than many of the early emulators
to get the calls right.. for example SD and DISK76 work correctly. I believe
that there are some undocumented manipulations of fields in the FCB bu BDOS
which are not handled, so the WORDSTAR install program, written before random
i/o, manipulated these fields directly, and fails on my emulation.
The package was distributed with source as V20BOOT.

I think that a problem you'll run into is that the Kaypro's system tracks
are single density, even though the rest of the disk is double density.
As I don't have a Kaypro myself, I'm operating on what I recall reading
somewhere some years ago, so caveat coorespondent! :-)

That's Cromemco's "68000 Cromix"...I have an old version of it and
still use it.  But Cromemco also sold a different product called
"Z80 Cromix."  I saw it running once, a long, long time ago.

Here's a blurb about Z80 Cromix from an old Cromemco product catalog:

"Cromemco's CROMIX multi-user, multi-tasking operating system is a UNIX-
like system which is available for use on all Cromemco Z80-A microcomputer
systems with a minimum of 128K of RAM. [...]  Important features:

. Multiple tasks, multiple users [I wonder what response time was like?!]
. Multiple hierarchical directories
. Record level locking
. Interprocess communication using pipes & signals
. Execution of multiple processes in a single memory bank
. Prioritized process execution
. I/O redirection
. Flexible shell [Actually pretty primitive.  Looping via IF - GOTO...]
. Login with password, access permissions on files
. Resident, swapping-free execution of tasks and servicing of users
  through bank selection for rapid context switching."

Not too bad for a cut-down UNIX-like OS that ran on a Z80 and floppies.
I wonder if there are any surviving copies out there?

Subject: Otrona Attache PC Info
Message-ID: <MRL6E5D@xds7.ferranti.com>

A friend and I recently picked up a couple of Otrona Attache CP/M machines
at a company garage sale.  They appear to be neat little portable CP/M
machines: two DSDD 5.25" floppy drives, hi-rez graphics (well, as hi-rez as
you can get on an itty-bitty 4" screen), battery-backed clock, sound chip,
two serial ports and an expansion slot.  One machine is fully functional;
the other's motherboard is dead.  We got one Attache user's guide, boot
disks and some application software in the deal.

We would like to see if anyone out there has any schematics for the main
board.  We would gladly pay for the cost of copying, shipping and handling.
Maybe we have the software that someone else is lacking and can swap.

Also, one of the machines (the dead one) had an 8086 coprocessor board
installed in it.  It also has an IEEE-488 port on it.  We installed the
board in the working machine but it did not cause any difference in
operation.  Supposedly there are CP/M-86 and MS-DOS boot disks for the
coprocessor board.  If anyone has information on this board or has the 8086
disks please let me know.

Thanks in advance,
Greg

  I remember the first time I was introduced to kermit, about 5 years ago
and I haven't been able to live without it since....
Well, 1. the parity on both ends have to match....
      2.  the receive and send packet lengths have to match....
      3.  you can sometimes get away with having different file
          types set on both ends but most of the time they have
         to match...
      4.  finally, depending on how fast the vax responses, you may
         have to set a delay time, otherwise your micro-kermit will
         not catch the first initialization packet that the vax
         sends out and it will just sit there.....
        (on unix you usually do a <sleep :duration:> command, but on
        vax you should be able to set that parameter....

    that's the basic troubleshooting routine there....hope that helps..

That's not necessarily true.  She puts her shareware fees much
too high for it to be with most shareware which goes from
$15-~$90.  Like I said in an earlier message, it isn't worth THAT
much.   If you consider unreasonably high shareware fees "not
liking Joan's attitude", so be it.  I consider her attitude as
only partly why I wouldn't buy it.  It's the unreasonably high
shareware fee that she asks which is not convincing me not to buy
it.

I guess the reason yo find it a convenient reason is because it's
so easily obtained.  It's distributed on the "try-before-you-buy"
basis that is shareware.  Also, just wondering, did you yourself
pay the $150 she asks for it?  Or did you find out about how much
she wants and then decide not to use it?

No, kaypro disk format is double density on the system tracks too.  I'm
quite sure of this as I once dis-assembled and re-wrote the monitor ROM
code to use quad density drives.  (When it still cost money to get the
source code for it.)

When double density drives first came out there were a number of
systems that did make the system tracks single density.  The ones
that I knew of were all 8" floppies though, but I suppose someone
did it with 5 1/4 floppies too.

Grumble!  This bounced the first time.  It's a little late, but still applies.

--------------------------------

In reference to the card in Steve's Xerox 820-II, and in the spirit of general
information sharing (I saw some incorrect info), I have written the following
note.  :-)

---------

As has been pointed out, the Xerox 820 has NO card edge slots.  The 820-II,
16/8's or what have you ... the CPU board is the same for all of them, had two
card edge slots near the left side.

There were only 4 cards for Xerox 820's made in the USA.  Two of them were for
the left card connector and two of them were for the right.  In all cases, when
I say right and left, it will be as if I was looking into the machine from the
rear.

The left slot is for the drive controller.  It will contain either a floppy
controller card (works with both 5.25" or 8" drives), a hard drive interface
card (8" drives only), or NO board if it's a 16/8 machine with a DEM (Disk
Expansion Module).  Off the top of my head, the hard drive card is maybe 3"
tall, while the floppy controller is maybe 4" tall.  NEVER connect the floppy
controller card to a hard drive, as you will blow the floppy/hard drive
controller board down the line.  I do not think connecting a hard drive
interface board with floppy's will cause any damage, but I wouldn't chance it.

The right slot will contain NO board if it's a standard Xerox 820-II, a 16/8
board if it's a 16/8 (that's an 8086 system on a card, for those of you who do
not know), or a DEM buffer board if this is a 16/8 with DEM.

Now that I think of it, there was also a 256K memory expansion board for the
16/8, which plugged directly into the 16/8 board.  Very hard to find and
expensive.

I have seen notes where Rank Xerox (in England) may have made some additional
cards which went into the DEM.  (Note:  The DEM has a card cage which can hold
4 or 5 cards, one of which would be the 16/8 card.)  There may have been an RX
memory expansion card (256K) for the 16/8, and there may have been an RX fancy
video graphics board.

The most notable incorrect things I saw was that sombody said the 16/8 board
contained an 8088, and that the DEM connected up to the 16/8 board.

Hi everyone, 

I'm very sadly reporting, that due to a technical problem with the host system,
I had to shut down the ZNODE 51 reachable through NBBS Munich 08165/60041 for
the time beeing. We are working on the problems, but it seems we have to 
recompile part of the BBS's source code to achieve trouble-free connection.
 
For now - the MS-DOS machine and CP/M (ZCPR34) machine talk to each other in a
way they shouldn't. The host thinks, someone wants to log in, when the ZNODE
is resetting itself on the timed hours. Hopefully, we will get this going again
soon. If anybody should need quick help, drop me a line here at floenz1.
 
Thank you for your attention.
 
With kind regards

The only Kaypros that used single-density system tracks were the original
Kaycomp II's -- they had single-density drives.  I think that the Xerox
double-density formats had single-density boot tracks.  I have a friend
who put several 820-II's together, and I'll ask him about it (he still
has his Big Board, but he uses an Amiga now).

   if anyone does have a copy of it, could ya let me know??  sounds like
something i'd like to play with, maybe port it over to an sb180 that
runs at 12 mhz or so...
 
   that'd be wicked... a multi-user, multi-tasking machine the size of
a disk drive enclosure, with disk!!
 
   now, another question - does anyone know who produces z80 compatible
chips that run faster than 8 mhz??  i think hitachi makes a 12 mhz hd64180,
but i'm looking for something more like an nsc800.
 
   no, the 12mhz v20 doesn't count...  it doesn't execute z80 code...

Message-ID: <a71c0e.3f72@quack.sac.ca.us>

I am a unix sysadmin, and one of the users on my system has a
Bondwell 12. Some of the screen control codes he read off lead
me to believe it's soroc compatable (^[= to move, ^[* to clear,
^] to home, ^[T to clear to EOL), but he reports that this
does not work. He has tried MEX and IMP.

If anyone can help him out, he'd appreciate it. He's stuck
with readnews and /bin/mail, and that's no way to use unix. :-)
He needs to know what this computer emulates, or failing that,
a unix termcap entry. If it really IS a soroc, then he
would like to know why it's not working.

His e-mail address is gtittle@quack.sac.ca.us. He thanks you in
advance.

There were a number of third-party controllers for the Xerox 820-II made as
well, which used easier to find/cheaper components than Xerox supplied. This
arose because of the large number of 820-II boards on the surplus market
that needed the controller cards which weren't available. Some of these are
still available at reasonable cost or even as build-it-yourself.

For the 820-I and 820-II, there are also hard disk SASI adapter cards that
plug into the parallel port (Z80-PIO ports) allowing use of a SASI/SCSI
hard disk controller and appropriate hard drives - ST506, ESDI etc.

Subject: Big Board/Xerox history

Yes, the Xerox systems and Kaypros were both based upon the Big Board.
The 820-I is, for all intents and purposes to me, a Big Board with some
frills.  The -II and 16/8 became progressively different from the mother
system (evolution, I suppose is the word).  The same is true of the Kaypro
systems; they started out as Big Boards with some changes, and then
progressed, although on divergent paths from the Xerox line.  This
explains the communications ports similarities, and the basic screen
code similarities.

I apologise for any problems this may have caused.  I have downloaded several
files from this site, which appears to be a VAX at North Carolina STtate
University.  I have always used this technique:

Step 0:   CHANGE YOUR PASSWORD ON YOUR HOME SYSTEM!!!  This is important as
            you'll see in a moment.
Step 1:   Use telnet to connect to 128.109.153.4, ccvax1.cc.ncsu.edu
Step 2:   When the site asks for your user id, tell it PUBLIC
Step 3:   The site will scroll an opening screen at you.  Press Q at its end
Step 4:   Tell it yes or no for terminal type=vt100
Step 5:   Tell it S for Software (The News is all local)
Step 6:   Enter VOL.  The system lists categories, allows you to select one
Step 7:   (less detail) Work out what you want.  Get into it's volume
Step 8:   Tell the system you want to GET
Step 9:   Tell the system the name of the file
Step 10:  Tell it you want to get it using F for FTP
Step 11:  Tell it your node address, either as numeric ID or name,
            for example, marlin.jcu.edu.au
Step 12:  Tell it your userid, or if your machine allows uploads via
            anonymous FTP, maybe you could tell it anonymous.  I dont't know,
            since mine doesn't.  NOTE that userids with lowercase characters
            eg. UN*X ids, must be enclosed in " marks.
Step 13:  This is the reason for changing your password to something before
            you start--tell it your password, enclosed in " if it contains
            significant lowercase.  Again, if your machine allows anonymous
            uploads, you might be able to get away with telling it something
            that your machine would accept as a password from an anonymous
            FTP uploader.  I don't know.
Step 14:  Tell it the path for the directory to upload to, or press return
            to have it upload into the directory it will be logged into
            when it logs on (your home directory if you've given it your
            own id).
Step 15:  The NCSU machine will connect to your home machine via ftp, using the
            id and password and path you have provided.  It will upload the
            file you've selected.  I've obtained both text and binary files
            this way, and neither sort gets mangled.
Step 16:  After it has uploaded the file to your machine, it will return control
            to you.  You can continue doing whatever.
Step 17:  You work out how to log off.
Step 18:  CHANGE YOUR PASSWORD BACK TO NORMAL IMMEDIATELY, if you have had the
            ncsu machine log on as anything other than anonymous.

Complex?  You bet.  It does work, though, and there is a very good selection
of software available, including lots of IBMPC, Mac, CP/M, Tandy 100/102.  In
my original posting I suggested that it should be possible to FTP directly from
128.109.153.4.  When I said that, I was relying on some information that had
appeared in comp.sys.tandy re the NCSU site.  That poster suggested that you
should FTP to the site, then give FTP the userid PUBLIC.  I hadn't tried this
then.  I have now, and it doesn't seem to work.  The above method does, and
shouldn't be too dangerous if you change your password immediately before
and after allowing the ncsu machine to send you files.

Er... This is a fascinating discussion. What's intriguing to me is that
Z80MU *DOES* support the "set DMA" call perfectly well! Furthermore,
every assembler and compiler and loader that we've come across works
perfectly well under Z80MU. At least, they work perfectly well under
LEGITIMATE copies of Z80MU.

Is it possible that somebody is using a corrupted copy of Z80MU? That's
the only logical explanation that I can think of. We have seen quite a few
corrupted copies out there. Who knows how or why it happens, but that's
the breaks of Electronic Distribution. Once you let it out, you can't
control what happens to it.

I'm setting the record straight because I own Z80MU. Not a copy of it. The
*REAL* Z80MU that Joan Riff wrote for me 4 years ago and that I rewrote
myself. That's how I know that a *REAL* copy supports CP/M 2.2 perfectly
well, even down to redirecting hardware I/O port addresses to 16-bit
IBM PC port addresses for you fanatics who *REALLY* want to run a CP/M
version of KERMIT or whatever.

Drop me a line. I'll be glad to help to identify legitimate copies of
Z80MU 3.10 (the last public domain version) and Z80MU 5.2b (the
current, commercial version).

There are thousands of folks running *LOTS* of off-the-wall CP/M software
with Z80MU, and just about everything works perfectly well for them.

Gosh, maybe there *ARE* benefits to buying a legitimate copy...

I wrote ZMP V1.5 and MEX V1.14 modem programm overlays for the 
OSBORNE 1. Both supported most of the needed functions - baud 
rate switch, bits, modem init, break, disconnect, etc. The MEX 
overlay also emulate an VT100 (ANSI) terminal.
If you work with an 2400 baud modem my hardware extention would 
be useful for you. This extention use the OSBORNE 1 modem port to 
generate an real RS - 232 C interface. So you can send an break 
and disconnect to the modem . The overlays works with the 
extention and allow to switch between three (four) baud rates 
-300,600,1200,2400-.
If you are interested in the overlays or in the schematics please 
contact me.

The following program is being announced here because it will assist

Now available via anonymous FTP from SIMTEL20:

Directory pd3:<misc.unix>
BATCHFTP102.TAR-Z

BatchFTP (v1.02) is a very useful BSD Unix program to automate
connections to anonymous ftp sites.  The program can be run as
a background process while the user does other work or logs out.

Rename the file to batchftp.tar.Z, uncompress, and extract with tar.
See the doc file for directions on how to compile and use the program.

Message-ID: <1990Oct30.154803.15391@news.arc.nasa.gov>

A while back, I got a compupro system.  Unfortunatly, the supply of
documentation is limited.
It came with G & G's MP/M 8-16 (I am assuming that G & G engineering
took standard MP/M and added 
goodies to it). I suspect that it is missing some of the utilities, but
I cannot be sure, due to 
the missing documentation.


1) What is the proper way to put it into multi-user.  I tried to do it
by typing "logout" and
get a login prompt at the terminals (currently only two).  I can login,
but it does not seem to
recognize that a user on on the system.  For example, I sent my self
mail, I looked at it manually,
but I cannot read it with mail ("you have no mail").  What am I doing wrong?

2) How do I set the default buad rate on the console port.  It wants to
be 19.2 at power-up. I can
change it to 9600 after I issue the "logout", but it goes back to 19.2
after reset or power-up.

3) What would be a default set of parameters for a gen.  I have them for
standard Digital Research
MP/M, but G & G appears to be different.  I have looked at things on the
disks that I have, but
they look like they are not "standard".

4) Any other information they you might have on this system.

  the copy of z80mu i have is version 3.10, dated 3/14/86.  it does not
run load.com, the cp/m hex loader.  i doubt that it is a corrupted
copy (i.e. corrupted by a missed error in transfer) because it gives
me an error message.  it doesn't lock up the system, it terminates
the loader, says that i'm trying to use an unsupported feature, and
gives me back the artificial ccp prompt.  it even identifies the
function i'm trying to use.  if the gremlins of crc error dectection
are at work, they sure did a thorough job!!

   now, there is always the possibility that somebody "patched" it
to make it fail, but i doubt this.  most idiots that go to the trouble
to do that would have done other things, like low leveled my hard
disk, written sporatic trash into the directory, or scrambled the
FAT.
 
   z80mu is nice, when it works.  it's about as fast as a 2mhz z80 on
my system (16mhz 286 with neat chipset and very fast ram) but it seems
that it (at least the one i have) doesn't emulate cp/m as well as i need
for my uses, so i'll probably stick to running cp/m code on a cp/m
machine.
 
   the z80 emulation is fine, but if it can't run cp/m then it's
REALLY an orphan.

Newword.  Could someone tell me how Newword's printer overlay 
works?  Looks like I'll have to install the Fujitsu manually since 
it's not on the printer menu and, of course, none of the 
dot-matrix printers on the menu work.
Thanks for any help.

If anyone cares, I also have written a Z-80 interpreter and CP/M
system for unix, and it's currently in beta-test. It is painfully
slow, but that's to be expected, really. The BIOS is written in
C, but the BIOS table can be played with, if you want, and BIOS
can be moved "down" to make himem space available.

Since it's in Beta, there's tons of debug stuff in the code that
will probably come out (special thanks to eichin@athena.mit.edu
for all his bug fixes), but it appears to run pretty well.

The interpreter also has interrupt hooks, and all sorts of other
junk. It actually simulates a Mostek MK-3880, but that should
be the same thing as a Z-80.

If there is tremendous interest, I could post the thing to
comp.sources.misc, but the codes sort of messy right now.

The code is copy-lefted. You can pass it around, but you can't
charge for it.
