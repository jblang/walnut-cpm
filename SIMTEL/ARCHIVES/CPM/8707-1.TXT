Subj: Re: July RCP/M list now available from SIMTEL20

In his message "id 8896; Thu, 02 Jul 87 04:38:30 EDT", Keith Petersen
<W8SDZ@SIMTEL20.ARPA> says that new files are available on the server at
SIMTEL20.

Unfortunately, some days ago Frank Wancho <WANCHO@SIMTEL20.ARPA> announced
that the archive server at SIMTEL20 has been shut down completely (which
seems to be true, the system refuses to deliver messages to the server).

My conclusion is: either i am completely confused, or there are other ways
of accessing the archives (without the ARCHIVE-SERVER), or one of Keith
and Frank is wrong.

Could someone enlighten me on this ??? Thanx a lot !

Ralph Becker-Szendy

P.S.: I think it is very sad that the server had to shut down. I completely
agree with Mitch Mlinar <POISSON.USC.EDU!MLINAR@OBERON.USC.EDU>: for people
on a low budget looking for good PD software to run their system (whether
professionally or as a hobby, i do a little bit of both) the best (and in
many cases only) source has been shut down. Hope some other place takes
the whole thing over soon !

How is it possible to get access to one of those still running
machines via BITNET ???

I'm confused. Is only the mail server shutting down? Are the files still
available via anonymous ftp?

Ken,
     Only the Archive Request Server has been shut down indefinitely.
All our public domain files continue to be available via anonymous

Subject: New files uploaded to SIMTEL20 during June

The following is a complete list of CP/M-oriented files uploaded to
SIMTEL20 during the month of June, 1987.  The numbers following
the filenames are the file size in bytes followed by the file format.
(7) means ASCII, (8) means binary.

For a complete list of all CP/M files, see:
   PD:<CPM>CPM.CRCLST - Complete list with CRC values
   PD:<CPM>CPM.ARC    - The above, ARChived (much smaller), binary(8).
   PD:<CPM>FILES.DIR  - Abbreviated list with only directory and file names
   PD:<CPM>FILES.IDX  - Similar to below, no descriptions, comma delimited

There is currently no complete listing of all files, with descriptions.
That is in the process of being created and will be announced when
available.  In the meantime, see PD:<CPM.GENIE>GENIECPM.JZN which is a
complete listing of all CP/M files on GEnie, each with a one-line
description.  Since SIMTEL20 and GEnie have many of the same files,
this will be a very useful listing.  It is updated monthly.

Note: to save space in the following listing, the device name PD: which
normally appears ahead of the directory name has been omitted.

SIMTEL20 continues to be a reposity for public domain software.  That
has NOT changed.  Those on the Internet may continue to access the
files using "FTP" (a file transfer program not related to netmail).

What WAS shut down was the netmail server which allowed those NOT on
the Internet to get files via netmail.

PC Pursuit is a service of Telenet which allows subscribers in the
United States to call any Telenet node and connect with an outgoing
dialer modem in about 20 large cities.  It costs a flat fee of $25 per
month.

GEnie is a large national on-line timeshare system, available by
subscription only ($5 per hour for 300/1200 bps), to users in the
U.S.A., Canada, and Japan.  They are NOT connected to other networks.

My remote CP/M system is a free access system available via telephone
dial-up.  It also happens to be in one of the cities that PC Pursuit
serves.  It is NOT accessable from any other network.

..and don't know much about it.

     It's an old PerSci model 277 drive for 8" diskettes with a
voice-coil type head mover.  This thing drives two single-sided
diskettes with one spindle; there are two slots for diskettes.

     Even more fun: the spindle motor appears to be DC and is speed
controlled via some kind of servo control loop; there's a plastic ring
passing through an optodetector and the ring has lots of little black
lines etched in it.

     It does have a standard 8" 50-pin board edge for a push-on
connector.  However, the power connector is completely foreign to me;
uses a 9-pin Molex push-on connector.

     It was removed from working equipment so it might even still run.
Does anyone have information on this thing?  Will standard 8" disks
work in it?  Do the disks require servo information for head
positioning?

     Information will be appreciated.

Regards,
Mark

There was some discussion awhile back regarding hard disk extensions (I think
so anyway).  One aftermarket hard drive add-on I am aware of (having a
couple myself) is the Emerald Microware hard disk upgrade.  An adapter card
plugs into your Z80 socket (or for some Kaypros, into the hard drive connector)
and into a Western Digital card; the software supports up to 2 hard drives of
any size up to 64M with logical partitioning into up to 8 drives each.  You
COULD stuff 128M of hard drive into your Robie, but I am comfortable with 40M
on my stuff with 5M partitions.

I believe Robie's are very strange, but the software works on all Z80 machines
without a hitch.  The number is (503) 641-0347.  I don't recall the price
offhand - mine are 1 and 2 years old - and it is dependent upon how much hard
drive you want anyway.

Is there an Applicard CP/M driver available for the Leading Edge 3.5"
microfloppy with the Leading Edge Universal Disk Controller?  (This is the 
unit sold by Central Point Software.)  I'd like to stick a couple of them on
my //e to get a little better disk performance.  But I don't want to blow the
cash only to find that I can't use what I've bought.  I'm not a sharp enough
Apple programmer to write my own driver.

(I ought to know the answer to this one - but don't!)

I have a disk in Apple II CP/M format, and need to transfer it 
to a Kaypro.

I have occasional access to a Kaypro (it actually belongs to my
mother, who needs the software and is 1000 kilometers away), and
none at all to an Apple.

Is there a utility that will read an Apple II CP/M disk on a
Kaypro? Are the formats even that compatible?

All pointers gladly accepted..

     I can reccomend Microsystems .  It still has CP/M articles
and columns.  It has started carying pc type info also, but has a
strong CP/M history.
      Also, Micro Cornucopia has a lot of CP/M articles.
   I do not have the subscription information on either of thes
magazines, but your local library should be able to help.

Hello All -

     I never realized the resource Info-CPM presents when I posted my
request for information on the Persci 277 disk drive.  Many people
responded with comments on the drive (mostly favorable in terms of
reliability) and there have been several offers of manuals.

     My thanks to those that responded (I have replied to them
individually) and to those whose messages have yet to arrive.

     Thanks also to the powers-that-be for the existence of the
Info-CPM list without which I'm sure a lot of neophytes would still be
wandering around in the dark.

Happy regards to all -

Subject: Testsites for MS-DOS disk emulator?
Date: Thu, 09 Jul 87 12:14:30 PDT


I've developed a software extension to CP/M, tentatively called
DosDisk, that allows CP/M programs to use files stored on an MS-DOS
(PC-DOS) floppy disk _directly_ -- without intervening translation or
copying.  When DosDisk is loaded, you designate one floppy drive as
the dos drive.  Regular CP/M programs can then read, write, rename,
erase, and change the attributes of MS-DOS files, just as if they were
stored on a CP/M disk.  For example, you can edit MS-DOS text files in
place.

DosDisk differs from specialized CP/M file transfer programs (such as
UniForm or MediaMaster).  They require MS-DOS files to be copied to a
CP/M drive to be used.  DosDisk, in contrast, "mounts" the MS-DOS file
system on the selected drive, making that disk effectively part of the
CP/M system.

DosDisk requires:
   a Z80-type processor
   CP/M 2.2, 3.1, or equivalent
   about 3K + 2K for command processor
   a BIOS that can support MS-DOS DSDD 40 track 9-sector format.
   an assembly-language overlay to interface to the BIOS

When fully tested DosDisk is expected to be available as a low-cost
commercial or shareware program.

I'm looking for users interested in developing and testing the
interface overlay for a variety of CP/M computers.  Tests are
already underway for:
	Kaypros with TurboRom 
	Ampros
	SB-180's

Potential testsites should:
   have a computer other than one of the above
   also use MS-DOS
   have advanced assembly-language experience
   be willing to contribute overlay code
   have a BIOS with provision for specifying "foreign" disk formats 

If you're interested, please reply directly to me.  I'd also like to
hear from less technical users about the program's potential
usefulness to them.

Apples *record* data differently from cp/m and ms/dos disk
controllers, and there's no way the Kaypro's hardware can be made to
read or write a disk from an Apple disk controller.

For 100+ cp/m formats and ms/dos formats, there are format-to-format
copy programs.  Specifically for the Kaypro, Plu*Perfect Systems
has MULTICOPY, which runs on Kaypros with a TurboRom.  It supports
direct use of foreign formats as well as file-copying capability.
UniForm and MediaMaster are other file-copy utilities.

But for Apple <--> Kaypro, the best thing to do is hook up the two
machines with communications software and upload/download the files.
You'll need one communications program for each machine -- eg
MEX for Kaypro, AsciiExpress for Apple.

I don't use cpm much but i have a small problem with a machine here
i'm trying to get software and data off of. the software is ok (ascii
transfer) but i'm having to uuencode all the data files to transfer
them. The machine is a british made systime 500. which is cpm86 based
with cpm 2.2. It uses 4 4mb removable cartridges and 5 rs232 ports at
the back and can support up to 4 users. I thought that rainbow(also
cpm86) kermit might work on this so i hexified it and transfered to
the systime and it worked... sort of. The program ran but the data
didn't seem to be coming out of any of the ports in the back of the
machine.

what i want to know is if there is any way of defining a
communications channel in cpm (as you can see i know very little about
it) or is kermit hardware specific for the rainbow, which has a coms
port. If it is is there any ready written communications software
written in ms-basic ( the only language around on the systime) which i
could port on to it. Uuencoding isn't so bad for the smaller files
(<250K) but there are several here which exceed 2.5mb so i could be
here for YEARS transfering them

Thanx

Micro Cornucopia is a great magazine, but they've got the

in the most recent issue.  I would recommend Micro C to anyone
who has an interest in hardware and software beyond the

Sorry, Ian, but CP/M lacked a REAL generic interface to a serial port.
All modem software for CP/M is hardwired for a given port at some point
or another; nearly all BIOSes have no provision for it.  The rainbow software
is operating on another port.

There may be hope, however, since many modem programs (early ones) have a
few bytes you can "ding" to change the port # to the proper value.  You
WILL need SOME information about that machine (I never heard of it) as well
as the program to figure out where to ding it.  (Or, if you know the port
information, any PD modem program could have an overlay written for it and
that would also solve your problem.) Otherwise, a good CP/M hacker could
find it for you, but it would take a little time...

Good luck.

Anyone  out  there  have any ideas or knowledge of the Corvus.  I

Toshiba T-100 microcomputer with 64k of memory, two double-sided,
double density disk drives, an RGB color monitor and 300 baud
modem. The system was purchased in late 1982 for over $3,000. I'm
willing to sell it for $750.

Price includes CP/M 2.2, TBASIC (a propietary operating system that
resembles BASICA on an IBM PC), a customized copy of the Write!
word processing system, a C compiler, a copy of WhizLink terminal
emulation program and a copy of Uniform. Also
included is a custom cable that you'll need if you want to connect
the T-100 to a printer using the parallel port.

Toshiba sold about 3,000 T-100's in the United States during 1982-1984.
The machine was, apparently compatible with the T-200 and T-250 that
were also sold around this time. The T-100 includes a port for a
RAM cartridge that holds 32k of memory. The RAM packs were supposed
to act as mini-RAMdisks under CP/M or TBASIC. The T-100 also has
a proprietary ROM cartridge port that was supposed to accept a
PASCAL interpreter.

If you're interested contact me directly through electronic mail.

     This document is intended to give a brief overview of files stored
in the public domain archives at SIMTEL20.

     Many of the files in our archives have been compressed and/or
grouped together in a single file by using one of the utilities
available to the public domain that either SQueezes, CRUNCHes,
LiBRaries, or ARChives files.  This has been done to minimize disk
storage requirements and also to minimize download time.

     These processed files are specially named with a filetype and can
be identified by the last 3 letters of a filename after the "." that
signifies the conversion.  These are:

        .ARK   for CP/M files archived (same as MS-DOS "ARC").
        .LBR   for files libraried.
        .?Q?   for squeezed files (middle letter is a Q).
        .?Z?   for crunched files (middle letter is a Z).

     A library is a group of files collected together into one file in
such a way that the individual files may be recovered intact.  A
library file can be identified by the "LBR" as the extent of the file
name.  LU (Library Utility) is a CP/M utility used to maintain
libraries of files.  LU does not perform any compression.  Because of
this, most people will squeeze or crunch files before adding them to a
library if they want to save space.  If you want to remove the
component files (members) from a LBR file, you should have a copy of
LU.COM or other LBR extractor utility.  At the end of this document is
a list of the programs available for that function with libraries.

     Recently, popular CP/M Public Domain software files and
information files are being distributed using ARCHIVE files.  Archive
files are similar to library (LBR) files in that they take a logical
group of files and put them together in a single file.  The main
difference, is that the members of the "ARC" or "ARK" file are
automatically compressed.  The compression algorithm chosen is one of
three which will produce the smallest file.

     Archive files have been available to the MS-DOS and PC-DOS areas,
but, have been made useful in the CP/M environment with the
introduction of the "UNARC" program.  The current version is 1.6, and
is available with extensive documentation, and two executable COM
files, a 8080/8085 version and a Z80 version.  The Z80 version takes
advantage of the expanded Z80 (and equivalent) instruction set for
speed and size, and therefore is machine dependent.  There is also a
modification overlay to adapt the program to non-standard CP/M 2.2 and
3.0 operating systems, such as CP/M68k and CP/M emulators.  Programs
are available on many machines to process "ARC" files, the Atari ST,
systems running the UNIX systems, systems running MS-DOS, and CP/M.

     There currently is no CP/M utility available to make an "ARK"
file.  Archive files will be made in the MS-DOS/PC-DOS, TOPS20 or UNIX
environment.  To avoid confusion on RCP/Ms that support both MS-DOS
and CP/M callers, Archive files have a file extension of "ARK" for
CP/M software and information files.

     Some files on SIMTEL20 have been compressed, using one of the
standard public domain utilities, to minimize download time and to
save storage space.

     Files that have been compressed can be identified by the filetype
(the last 3 letters of a filename after the '.') that signifies the
compression.  These are:

        .?Q?   for Squeezed files (middle letter is a Q).
        .?Z?   for Crunched files (middle letter is a Z).

     USQ120.COM is used to unsqueeze, or expand files that have a "Q"
as the middle letter of the filetype.  Such files have been squeezed,
or compressed with SQ111.COM or similar.  These programs use Huffman
Encoding to reduce the size of the target file.  Depending on the
distribution of data in a file it can be reduced in size by 30% to 60%
by squeezing it.  If you download a file with a filetype indicating
that it is squeezed, you will need USQ120.COM to expand it before you
can use it.  There are other programs available, written in different
languages and take advantage of special hardware, but USQ120 is
8080/8085/Z80 compatible.

     Other utilities are available that have the unsqueeze coding
imbedded and function with squeezed or unsqueezed files.  There are
programs that perform file maintenance functions (NSWP), bi-directiona
display utilities (BISHOW), and string search programs, (FYNDE and
FINDU).  This method of compressing files has been used for some time
now and programs to uncompress the files are available to several
micro processors and main frame computers.

     CRUNCH uses the Lempel-Ziv-Welch (LZW) techniques.  This method
is fast and offers compression ratios around 55%.  Highest compression
is achieved with graphics data, values of 90% are typical, followed by
text, with 50%, and COM files around 20%.  This method is new to the
CP/M environment.  See CRUNCH23.LBR for the Z80 CRUNCH and UNCRunch
programs.  See FCRNCH11.LBR for the 8080/8085 and V20 CRUNCH and
UNCRunch programs.

     Since this method of compression is relatively new, the only
utilities available that processes crunched files are "typer"
utilities such as TYPELZW, TYPEQZ, and LT, which also type members of
libraries and squeezed files.  If running a 8080/8085 processor, check
the documentation to determine if the utility will only process files
on systems using the Z80 processor.  Currently, there is no compatible
program for other micro processors or mainframes.

     MicroSoft BASIC programs are always saved as ASCII files (saved
with the ",A" operand).  They may than be squeezed or crunched.  This
has been done to allow them to be converted for use with other BASIC
compilers or interpreters.

     Some executable files have a file extension of "OBJ".  These are
really "COM" files that have been renamed to "OBJ" to avoid execution
on RCP/M systems.  Rename them back to "COM" for use them as commands
on your system.

Sounds to me like the interface used by Apple for their drives (the GCR
animals) - see if you can't find out where this came from, 'cause as we
all know, when used with standard MFM controllers (WD 1793 or NEC 765)
there is a (VERY) standard 34 pin connector used: I've got a couple of
Teac 55B's in my system, (double sided version of the 55A) and they use
the standard 34 contact edge connector.

Well, there is "pistol".  This program compiles only under BDS C.  I tried
porting it to other environments with very bad results -- virtually every
line fails lint.

I have never found a Forth in C worth fooling with.  The problems have been:

1. The Interpretter is very slow -- it goes from about 8 instructions (Z-80)
ending with a jump to a subroutine call in a loop (with all the subroutine
call overhead), and the registers cannot be globally assigned.  Figure an
overall 10x speed loss.

2. No implementation I have ever found has compiled on any machine other
than that for which it was originally written.

3. They were all done as experiments (can Forth be written in C?) and as
such tend to be incomplete.

I recently patched the 6DEC85 CP/M+ operating system to support 800K on the
new 1581 disk drive (incidently, they are now available and selling for
about $210 - less than a 1571).
This was necessary, since they are shipped without a new version of CP/M.
There is a card to order it from Commodore for $20, but it ain't ready
yet.

In case your're interested, I basically patched the portion of CXDISK.ASM
which sets up TYPE2 disks.  Change the 40 to 80 and 79 to 159.  Then fill
in an appropriate empty slot in the drive definition tables.  I used 
4K allocation blocks, and 1K physical blocks (it's necessary to format
the disks in Commodore BASIC before booting CP/M).

If you need further help, send mail, but I'll be unavailable for about
three weeks.

The program you need both for unix and cp/m is called 'uncr'.
The unix version is in pd:<unix.sq-usq> (I think thats the right 
name after the 'dot' it may be something like .lbr-arc or .arc-lbr, etc.)
Also it probably is 'uncrNN.c' where NN is the current version number.
The cp/m version is in pd:<cpm.starter-kit>.  There is a 'uncr-z80.com' 
and '.hex' and a 'uncr8080.com' and '.hex' for z80's and 8080's respectively.

If you have trouble finding the unix version, let meknow and I will look it
up.  Don't have the info handy right now.

    There is no "Avatex" overlay for IMP.  Any overlay must be MACHINE-
specific, not modem specific.  The Avatex will work fine with IMP's dialing
routine.

     Your only problem is/will be the return codes from the modem.  IMP will
try to initialize the Avatex for numeric response codes... and there aren't
any.

     Find a copy of I2VB-2.ASM.  This is a overlay that will adapt IMP to use
either verbose ( the words like "NO CARRIER" ), and the numeric codes.  Edit
it to match what you need, and assemble.  Add it *after* your machine overlay.

     This is a overlay for some machine, not the Avatex.

>Which program do I use to unsqueeze this?

     This is a CRUNCHed file.  Find a copy of CRUNCH23.LBR on a local RCP/M.
In it is a program called UNCR.COM.  Its use should be obvious.

     You should be able to get the same program for UN*X from SIMTEL20.  I
don't know the filename.

Pistol:  Portably Implemented Stack Oriented Language.

It is a forth like language.  Kind of useful, and amusing to play
with.  Another similar language is STOIC (sorry, I don't recall what
it stands for).  There are a number of Forths available for
CP/M, but I don't know if any are implemented in C.

Maybe I missed out on this thread but if you really just want PD Forth under
CP/M you can get lots of help - there are several fine system in the PD
(Laxen & Perry F83, Uniforth Sampler) and other useful Forths (8080 and Z80 
figs, MVP Forth-79...)

There is also one floating around allegedly from a UNIX system that is even 
worse than porting BDS: you need YACC and LEX to boot up the screen file.
It might be worth trying to compile on a UNIX system - it would be a lousy
performer though as Tom points out below.

Has anybody ported the Pascal version of PISTOL anywhere ?  It's DEC-20
Pascal and when I tried to do a minor hack for VAX/VMS Pascal I gave up.

>       I have never found a Forth in C worth fooling with.

I saw a system called "SIXTH" on the East and West coast Forth boards in
Lattice for a PC that had promise: only problem was it's core dictionary
source WORDS.C has a bad checksum coming out of the ARC.  If anybody has
a copy of this please ship it my way and I'll ship any fruitful efforts
back.

Another alternative also from the boards is a small Forth-like language
called MOUSE.  Peter Grogono gave Pascal source for that too, but it
doesn't port to VMS yet either... I'm not much for Pascal so I don't
push hard.  The Z80 source works fine under CP/M-80 though and it compiles
down into 2K.  Nice !  I can upload or FTP it someplace if there is
interest.

Subject: Re: cpmForth

If you just want CPM Forth, there is definitely a very good F83 Forth available
from SIGM. I can't remember the exact volume number - I think it's in the low
200's. It's not deluxe (no floating point, no full-screen debugger), but more
than adequate to get to know the language and build upon, and quite quick. I
used it to write a turtle graphics vocabulary for ascii terminals for my kids
to play with. (Try writing sines and cosines without floating point :-). If 
you want more info, holler.

Hello -

     Is anyone using Xebec's S100-to-SASI host adapter with a 1410
controller?  I have one in front of me and would love to get it
running.. but the adapter has had a bunch of wires added, several
traces cut, and I have no idea what options were wired in.  Also,
there are several jumper pads on the board which are not mentioned in
the meager documentation and I hesitate plugging this thing in without
more information.

     I have a diskette with Xebec's "plug-and-go" installation
software and some READ.ME-type files but none of them discuss board
jumpers.

     This is a Rev. 07 board and appears to be the non-DMA version.
Which brings up another point:  How tough would it be to install the
additional chips and hardware to turn it into the DMA version?

     Your help is appreciated -

Mark

A friend of mine will be going to England and Isreal for a month and a
half around Christmas time.  He does software development on an IBM PC
using dBase III+.  He would like to explore the possibilities of
marketing his services in Europe (England particularly) and Israel.

So I'd appreciate any answers to the following questions, for Europe, in
general, England, in particular, and for Israel:

  1.  What computers are most common?  Are they IBM PC compatible?
  
  2.  What operating systems are most common?  Are they MS-DOS/PC-DOS
compatible?  CP/M compatible?  Can dBase III+ run under the operating
system?  dBase II (he also has lots of experience with that)?
  
  3.  How common are personal computers?  Who has them?  Are they used
for business use only?  Personal use?  Both?
  
  4.  Is there likely to be a market for small business software for
handling customer and vendor bases, inventory, ordering, invoicing, etc?
What will the market bear, price-wise?  Must the price be under $100?
$200-500?  Will a package that costs over $1500 sell?
  
I appreciate any comments you may have.

Thank you,

Subject:  Sector crashes on double density driver for Xerox 820

I have a package from Software Publishers Inc. of Arlignton Texas which
converts the 8" floppies of my Xerox 820 from single density to one of seven
formats of double density.  The version I have is dated 15 March 1982.  The
problem is that occasionally and inconsistantly, sectors are wiped out during a
write.  Of course, I don't know this until I try to read them (BIOS error...).
I believe that the hardware headers are wiped out and that the controller
cannot read the sector (DU can't read the bad sectors).  This happens even when
writing one sector at time during a Kermit as well as during extracting and
unsqeezing files.  It seems to happen less often when I use a less dense format
and never when I revert to signle density.  I don't remember this ever working
consistently.

My question, then, is this:  Does anyone know if this can possibly be tied to a
bad release of the BIOS or the controller hardware where an update would fix
the problem (and if so, does this company still exist; there are no sources for
the BIOS - I can't see that software could do this kind of damage)?  Or is
this a media problem (I've been using Sony SSDD, though they may be old). Or
are my drives out of alignment or dirty (I've cleaned the heads; the
freqency of error is apparently the same on both of my drives)?  Is there
anybody out there with this kind of experience?  Should I just give up and
invest in a hard disk (any ST506 controllers out there for the 820)?

Sender: info-cpm-request@simtel20.arpa
To: info-cpm@simtel20.arpa

Some of you may remember this request from a month or so ago.  Unfortunately,
a problem that I thought was dead has resurfaced...

I have a client running a Dec Rainbow out to a 20 MB Corvus hard disk
that was being backed up via a Mirror system to a VHS VCR.  A while ago
the disk started to go soft, and was cleaned (on the strength of 3
extant back ups) to give the diagnostics a chance to isolate the bad
sectors.  Once the disk had been cleared and the tracks locked out it
was time to restore the data and that is when the fun started.

The backups (all *3* of them) refused to resore properly and the system
just hung.   After confirming that the tapes did have data on them ( it
sure wasn't Gone With the Wind :-} ) we began to swap various and sundry
pieces of the lash up to try and isolate the problem and finally restore
the data.

It eventually became clear that the problem was neither the Rainbow, the
Corvus, the controller or the Mirror Card, but (apparently) the copy of
the mirror utilities themselves.

Corvus is attempting to deny that they have ever even seen a CP/M system
and soft-peddling the fact that a back-up is sight specific ( I can read
mine but not yours, due to level/alignment/driver-design problems).

SO...what I need at this point is a reliable copy of the Mirror
utilities and/or any suggestions as to how I can extract myself from
this never-ending disaster...

Subject: No-slot clocks

     There are now at least three sources for "no-slot" clocks, the
cheapest of which is from Radio Shack on sale for $39.95.  The problem
is that the software that comes with it is an executable for MSDOS.
There is no source and no technical documentation on how to program it
under some other environment, such as CP/M.
     Short of writing Radio Shack directly, does anyone have the
necessary info to make it work under CP/M?  *Can* it work under CP/M,
or does it take advantage of some MSDOS peculiarity?
     For those unfamiliar with these no-slot clocks (probably
somebody's trademark), it is a clock/calendar chip and a lithium
battery wedged into the cavity of a PROM socket and meant to be
sandwiched between an existing ROM and its socket, or simply plugged
into any empty 28-pin ROM socket you may have available.  Seems to
simple to be true...considering that I have a whole S-100 card devoted
to apparently the same function...

Well, you hit jackpot!  I, and about 12 other people I know, all have SWP on
at least one system (2 for me).  And guess what - no problems to speak of.
There ARE drives that do not work well with it, among them are Mitsibushi and
Remex.  Shugarts and Panasonic work the best, although even Tandons do fine.

15 Mar 82 was the last version of ANYTHING by SWP: they are still in business
with a 68000 multi-user system and no longer sell or support the SWP cards.
The "guru" who invented the whole thing sold off and left, and Z-80 is some
archaic buzz-word from the past for the current crew....

SWP does not sell source, but MicroCode Consulting sells a BIOS for SWP with
their QP/M package: source for the BIOS is included (as well as the monitor).
A distributor is (still?) Emerald Microware (503) 641-0347.  The guy there
is also quite knowledgable about drives and also has hard disk upgrades which
plug into the Z80 slot and, through a Western Digital card, talk to up to
2 hard drives of 64M each.  (I have only 20M on mine, which is plenty; there
is no hard drive on the other ... sigh.)

My first guess would have been hardware, although the code COULD be damaged.
However, if that was really the case, then ANY density should fail rather
than getting better as less (density) stress is applied to the disk.  Don't
forget, this sucker is humping along at 2.5MHz and there is NO room for error.
It does not take much to miss the 1st sector with such a slow Z80 rate...

Another problem could be the floppies you are using; although 5.25 stuff is
very forgiving at double density (even if not marked), at least on this
package, poor 8" floppies show the same lousy symptoms discussed.  I use
strictly Maxell or IBM or Dysan (Xerox and BASF do not work well).  They must
be certified double-density - I swear that controller reads the bloody label
and refuses to work error-free when it sees a single-density disk while writing
at double-density!!!

Hope this helps.  Let me know how this comes out.  It is a really nice system
for vintage CP/M.

In a 6 July message to the net, Jon Mandrell asked for CP/M
magazine recommendations.  I'll recommend PROFILES, the KayPro
users magazine.  Although it does have MS-DOS stuff in it, it
continues to have lots of good CP/M info.  Back issues are 
available and are heavily CP/M oriented.  Address is:

PROFILES
P. O. Box 2889
Del Mar, CA 92014

I thinks it's a good deal at $25 for 12 issues.

Carefull on those no slot clocks!  They should work ok on any type of system, 
but not all NSC's are accessed equally.

We evaluated a couple of different brands here.            

Brand A: Waited & monitored all accesses to its memory location, looking for a
specific sequence of bytes.  When the "attention" sequence was detected, the
next set of bytes was intercepted & taken to be set/read commands.  This is
probably OK, as long as you are POSITIVE that there will be no interrupts
during the time you are trying to access the clock (we were positive that there
would be)

Brand B: Was actually a 2K x 8 RAM.  This replaced your existing 2K x 8 device,
was accessed and used just like normal RAM, except that the top 16 bytes ALWAYS
contained the time/date info.

So check your specs sheets BEFORE you buy one of these beasts.

I'm not familiar with the RS version of this device, but I have used the
Dallas Semiconductor (DS1200) with success.  I had it working with an 8051
as the CPU, so a Z-80 shouldn't be any trouble. I can supply a listing of
my code if that is helpful.  Also there was an article in Byte by Steve
Ciarcia using the 8052-Basic chip.  Contact me via email for further info.

I've been using IBAK for about 6 months now, and have had no problems with it.
As far as I can determine, it already _does_ copy all files, and can't tell
'most recently changed'.  One thing to be careful of, is that you can
back up R/O files, but when you attempt to restore them, things blow up. I've
also had problems trying to backup the entire contents of one hard disk to
a partition of another (I'm sure it will all fit).  How many other users of
IBAK are there out there?  It's saved me probably 6 hours a month in backup
time, (not to speak of floppies saved) for my monthly image backups.

Paul,
 
	I dunno about 10+ MHz, but a friend found 2M memory boards in a
HUG (Heath Users Group) magazine for $549 assembled or $300 without
memory chips.  You could probably add your own memory chips if you
needed higher speeds than it does.  Part of the price differential
is that IBM PC memory is dynamic and S-100 memory (the good stuff
anyway) is static.  Just check out the prices for the static rams
(chips only) sometime....
 
	I'll probably be getting one of these boards when my budget
recouperates from my ADIT purchase, so I can have a 2M RAM disk
for my SYSTEM: device, though any other suggestions are welcome.
I'll get you the name and number of the company above if you are
interested.

w_smith@wookie.dec.com
w_smith%wookie.dec.com@decwrl.dec.com
 
Does anyone else have any preferences for S-100 memory?  I think I'd like
to stick with static, too, but that tends to get expensive.  I'm going to
need at least 2M of RAM disk, using Macrotech VRAM boards would be around
$3200, a bit out of my price range....   :+)

Subject: Macrotech ADIT board


I'd really like to hear from other users of the Macrotech ADIT
board as to how they like it and if they have found any of the
following 'gotcha's:
 
1)	While you can set the baud rates all the way up to 38.4K,
	the maximum output rate (in chars/sec) is around 1200 CPS.
	The input won't overrun at 19.2K, but the input rate seems
	to be limited to around 1800 CPS.
 
2)	Using the board in interrupt mode takes about 75 percent
	_longer_ than polling it continuously.  Any interrupt
	latency would be added to this number.
 
3)	When the board is set up for 'input' flow control (such that
	it will send XOFF when it wants the terminal to stop sending)
	the automatic chaining of input buffers is disabled and you
	are stuck with a 28 byte input buffer.
 
4)	The M-channel and V-channel are _slow_slow_slow_.  I rewrote
	my hard disk cache and RAM disk software to take advantage
	of these powerful new features and my machine ran half as fast
	as it did before.
 
5)	(I haven't tried this yet, but it's in the manual).  When you
	send XOFF (assuming 'output' flow control is enabled) the board
	will stop transmitting.  When you send _anything_else_ it will
	resume transmission.  This means you can't have the output
	stopped and still have input typeahead.
 
It's been somewhat discouraging to pay $1100+ (discount) for a
board with 16 I/O ports, onboard intelligence, and lots of neat
features only to have it produce a negative impact on the speed
of my system.  Yes my system does several things that it couldn't
do before, but the most frequent things (program source editing)
I do are noticably slower.
 
I am working with the manufacturer to try to resolve some of
these difficulties, and I'll post the results, but it's almost
to the point where I'm seriously considering building my own
custom EPROM to replace the onboard firmware.
 
Anyway, if anyone is using one of these boards, I'd really like
to hear some discussion of the pros and cons of it, and any other
misfeatures I may have missed.

What specific Radio Shack store has the No-slot clock.  The two stores
in my local area (Corona California [Riverside County]) do not have
them.  They give me a blank look when I ask about them.

Their responce is, "if it's in our catalog we can get it for you, if
it's not, we can't".

I even suggested they call their head office to ask about them and they
came back again with the above responce about the catalog.

Where is Radio Shacks head office?  Perhaps I could call them myself.

What are some other sources?

How is that the No-slot clock address does not interfear with a ROM at
possibly the same address?

Is there a zcpr3x for the gs (not upgraded iie so starcard doesn't fit).
The only cpm card is the new (green led) ae card, support for gs ram or
3 1/2 would be nice.  AE supports it in their amdos but I do not think
there is a zcpr3 for it.  Regards, Allan

I am supposed to by two C-64's for a local school (actually computer, disk
and monitor).  Anyone care to offer recommendations about where to get a
good price?  Which mail order houses are good, or more importantly which
you have had bad experiences with.

Montgomery Grant, in New York has a C-64,1541, color printer and 12"monitor
for $370.  I realize that both the computer and disk are obsolete, but
they happen to be compatible with the rest of the systems that the school has.

Please send responses to me rather than posting it all.

Does anyone know of a CP/M version of the game Larn that runs on an apple IIe
with a Microsoft Premium Softcard IIe?  Larn was originally created by Noah
Morgan at GenRad Inc.  Bolton, MA.  We have a PD version at work that runs on
an IBM-pc that was ported to MS-DOS by D.  G.  Kneller, but for obvious
reasons I can't play it as much as I would like (sometimes I can sneak a quick
game in during lunch) and would like to get a version I can play on my apple
at home.  So far I haven't had any luck getting a DOS, ProDOS, Pascal,
Assembly, etc.  version so I thought I'd try to find a CP/M one.  Larn is a
dungeon type adventure game similar in concept to ROGUE or HACK.  If you know
of an CP/M version of this game (or an CP/M version of ROGUE or HACK or
another similar game for that matter) please reply to this forum or to
RANKINS@DOCKMASTER.ARPA

                                        Thanks in advance,

If I can add my two cents worth to the Paul Vixie/Willie Smith discussion
about S-100 memory --  If it will be used for RAM disk, there's a DRAM
solution that is much less expensive than the alternatives you've considered.
Digital Research (Computers) in Dallas, now has a 1 Meg RAM disc card
for S-100 systems.  A bare board with software and documentation runs
about $70.  It is 4 banks of 256K DRAMS with parity, and uses INTEL's
8203 memory controller chip.  I don't know how fast it will run, you'd
have to check that out with them.  I'm building one now, and considering
my past experience with their quarter Meg RAM disks ... I can't wait to
get it running.  They claim that it is possible to stuff up to 4 of these
cards in one buss, so one could have bunches of RAM disk for little $'s
(compared to the prices you guys are talking about).  It is also available
in kit form, but I'm not sure of the price.  Check it out!!

It was in the sales flyer before the latest one.  Hasn't appeared in
the latest catalog yet.  My local store (Tualatin Oregon) knew about them,
but the don't stock it.

*  The following is a description of an experimental facility.  *
*      For now, please keep it confidential to this group.      *
*****************************************************************
To all Info-CPM members on Bitnet:
     A copy of the CPM software archives from Simtel20 as been
placed on-line at RPICICGE.BITNET.  It is the complete set of files
from the directories PD:<CPM> and PD:<CPM.*> as of July 17, 1987.
The files are available to any Bitnet host that can receive files.
However, for the present, the following restrictions apply:

(1)  All files are delivered in IBM Netdata format.  This may be
     a problem for the non-IBM hosts.  A future anouncement may
     describe alternate formats.
(2)  All files are in their original, untranslated form.  (ASCII
     files have not been translated to EBCDIC.)  This may make some
     files (such as those in the starter-kit) difficult to use.
     Contact me directly if you need an alternate form.
(3)  Your are restricted to five file requests per day.

You may request files by sending /PDGET commands to LISTSERV@RPICICGE
either in interactive messages or in a mail message.  (For VM and MVS
hosts, TELL LISTSERV AT RPICICGE... can be used to send an interactive
message.  Other systems may have similar facilities.)  The format for
the /PDGET command is simply

       /PDGET  simtel20filename

where "simtel20filename" is exactly the same full name used at
Simtel20.ARPA.  For example, to get a copy of LASM.COM the command is

      /PDGET PD:<CPM.ASMUTL>LASM.COM

(case is not significant.)

Additional remarks:

(1) This service is being offered on a trial basis.  Three things
    will determine its longevity:  System load, network load, and
    disk space.
(2) Disk space will definitely be a problem.  The archive is huge.
    I expect eventually to migrate the older, less popular files
    to offline storage.  Offline files will be accessible on
    perhaps a weekly basis.
(3) Problems regarding the service should be sent directly to me,
    not the Info-CPM list.
(4) It is very indefinite how and when the archive will be updated
    to match Simtel20.  We'll have to see what is feasible.
(4) Other volunteers are still needed to share the load of hosting
    this and other archives from Simtel20.  If you are interested,
    contact Frank Wancho <WANCHO@SIMTEL20.ARPA> or myself directly.

                              -------------
 
   I would like once again to call to the attention of CP/M computer users
the only magazine I know of that still has a general focus on 8-bit hobbyist
computing.  It has been around for many years, but somehow has remained
largely unknown.  I did not discover it until last year and was amazed to
see the long list of back issues.  It is
 
                       The Computer Journal
                       Art Carlson, editor
                       190 Sullivan Crossroad
                       Columbia Falls, MT 59912
                       406-257-9119
 
It is published on a flexible schedule of approximately every other month.
A subscription in the US is $16 per year.  I regard it as a precious
resource for our 8-bit community, and I hope not only that you will
subscribe but that you will contribute articles as well.  If you have
written an interesting program or made an interesting modification, send in
a short piece.  I now have a column on ZCPR3 in every issue.  Rick
Lehrbaum, engineering vice president at Ampro, has been a frequent
contributor, having produced a series of articles on the SCSI interface.
The articles are very wide ranging, including both hardware and software.
There was a pair of fascinating articles on the art and science of soldering
and unsoldering!  A piece on disassembly techniques called "The Art of
Source Code Generation" was written by the individual who sells those famous
packages that will convert your Turbo Pascal and other programs to commented
source code.  Most of the people I have gotten to subscribe to TCJ have been
very happy with it, so I feel reasonably confident in recommending it.

Subject: Clarification about the RPICICGE archive

I have noted some confusion stemming from my announcement of a file
server on Bitnet for the Simtel20 CPM archives.  Perhaps this will
help:

(1)  The files are stored as CPM sector-image data.  They are sent
     as-is (in IBM netdata form).  If you have a non-IBM host, it
     will probably try to do EBCDIC to ASCII translation.  This will
     render the orginal data as garbage.  Take heart, however,
     uuencode support will be available soon....
(2)  For all of you that are familiar with LISTSERV and its commands,
     FORGET EVERYTHING YOU KNOW.  GET, INDEX, etc cannot be used to
     access the archives.  /PDGET is your only interface.  (To make
     matters even more confusing, my Listserv does have a CPM
     filelist, but it isn't the Simtel20 archives, and it is scheduled
     for deletion.)
(3)  /PDGET has no directory listing function at present.  However,
     You can /PDGET PD:<CPM>CPM.ARC and such to get the directory.
     You'll need a suitable program like ARCUTIL (available from me)
     or VMSWEEP to examine that file on your host rather than downloading
     to your micro.
(4)  I presently have only the directories CPM and CPM.*.  I do not have
     CPMUG.* or any of the others.  Maybe someday....

Try taking a look at the Ztime-I from Kenmore Computer Tech.
It goes under the Z80 socket and maps into I/O space.  Comes
with all the source you could ever need.  It has the added
advantage of being supported by lots of application programs
like DateStamper, Presto!....

dBase is NOT most popular over here - there are many others equal.

over 500,000 MS-DOS machines in homes. 2 in 3 homes have something
e.g. Sinclair Spectrum.

Business use IBM, Olivetti and Apricot mostly

What's a $ ??   1500 sounds like a lot, unless they're like yen!

 Many of you out there have expressed an interest in the Dallas Semi DS1216e
this chip can be installed under _any_ 24 or 28 pin device. I have written a
driver and utility to work with these modules, and it works with our V7/4.1
since it is written as an 'ioctl' character-special, device-driver. Now,
all I need is my employer's approval to post the code to .sources and y'all
can have a copy for free! It's written in C, it assumes 16bit ints and not
much else. We use the MC68020 almost exclusivly, and the device works fine
beneath the 27512 chip we use for booting. If my boss approves the posting,
I'll do it, otherwise you could mail me your requests for help and I'll try
to help you with this. The module is straightforward ONCE you understand the
screwy bit-serial interface method.

I can confirm that Jim Lill's address on GEnie is JIMLILL and that
there are no-slot clock drivers for the AppliCard available in Library
35 (APPLE) in the CPM section of GEnie.  There is considerable other
AppliCard s/w as well.  Download file No. 4427 from the CP/M Libraries
for a list of all Apple files as of 7/87

Subject: Additional functions for the LISTSERV@RPICICGE file server

I've made some additions to the /PDGET command.  It now supports
transfers to non-IBM hosts and through gateways.  It's full syntax is:

      /PDGET  <format>  simtel.filename  < ( encoding >

where <...> mark things that are optional.

"format" specifies the method of transmission to be used:
    NETDATA  -- suitable for transfer to Bitnet hosts that can accept
                files in IBM Netdata format.
    PUNCH    -- suitable for transfer to Bitnet hosts that can accept
                files but cannot decode the Netdata format.  Files
                are sent as 80-byte card-images.
    MAIL     -- suitable for transfer to hosts that can accept only
                mail or are accessible to Bitnet only through gateways.
                Large files sent via mail are split into several
                smaller files that the recipient must reassemble.
If the format is omitted, NETDATA is assumed for Bitnet hosts and MAIL
for all others.

"encoding" specifies any special encoding of the file data:
    ASIS     -- suitable for hosts that can receive binary data.  The
                file is sent exactly as it is stored on my system:
                CP/M sector images, binary mostly.  ASIS may be used
                only with format NETDATA.
    UUENCODE -- suitable for hosts that cannot receive binary data.
                The file is sent uuencoded.
    TRANSLATE -- suitable for any host, but only when the file actually
                represents readable text.  The file is translated to
                EBCDIC.  If you are on an ASCII machine, then your
                system should automatically translate to ASCII when
                the file arrives.) TRANSLATE applied to a binary file
                will yield trash.
If no encoding is specified, then ASIS is assumed for NETDATA, and
UUENCODE for the others.

Examples:
=========
In each of the following examples the user wants the CPM.CRCLST file to
examine on his host and the UNARC16.ARK file to download to his micro.
Note that none of the examples have a closing parenthesis!

(1)  The user is on an IBM host directly connected to Bitnet:
           /PDGET  NETDATA  PD:<CPM>CPM.CRCLST  (TRANSLATE
           /PDGET  NETDATA  PD:<CPM.ARC-LBR>UNARC16.ARK

(2)  The user is on a non-IBM host directly connected to Bitnet and can
     receive Netdata files:
           /PDGET  NETDATA  PD:<CPM>CPM.CRCLST  (TRANSLATE
           /PDGET  NETDATA  PD:<CPM.ARC-LBR>UNARC16.ARK  (UUE

(3)  The user is on a non-IBM host directly connected to Bitnet and can
     receive punch files:
           /PDGET  PUNCH  PD:<CPM>CPM.CRCLST  (TRANSLATE
           /PDGET  PUNCH  PD:<CPM.ARC-LBR>UNARC16.ARK  (UUE

(4)  The user is on some host somewhere:
           /PDGET  MAIL  PD:<CPM>CPM.CRCLST  (TRANSLATE
           /PDGET  MAIL  PD:<CPM.ARC-LBR>UNARC16.ARK  (UUE
