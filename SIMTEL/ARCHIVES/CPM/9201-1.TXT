Message-ID: <gdGDFWq00WBL82ZYQy@andrew.cmu.edu>

After reading about the interest in emulators, I thought that I would post
this pre-release notice.  Several years back (you've heard this before...)
I wrote an 8080 emulator that ran CP/M modulo a couple of minor bugs.  I was
in the process of upgrading it to a Z80 emulator when I became interested in
other things.  I have been playing with it again and may even finish it...

My emulator is written in C for BSD Unix.  I intend it to be public-domain.
I keep my copy of CP/M 2.2 in hex on-line for testing, but users will have
to supply their own copy.  Perhaps someone could come up with some "free"
alternatives.

I have several "devices" that can be accessed:
1) multiple ttys
2) emulated disks (one disk per Unix file)
3) Unix file access

If anyone has ideas of things that they would like to see in a portable
emulator, let me know and I will try to work them in.  It may take a while,
but if there is enough interest, it may keep me interested...

I need the disk formatting specs for 5.25 inch disks originally
used on an IMSAI 8080.
I have a cp/m disk emulator for an IBM but it needs the formatting
specs in order to work.

Any help is appreciated. Thanks

Hi everybody!  I just read the request for help on OSBORNE's video standard.
Well, it's really a standard composite video signal, that can be displayed on
any video monitor.  There's a trick though to get a reasonable display, since
OSBORNE does not use a standard screen size:  unwind the deflection coil of the
CRT by two circles, that should do it!
  
In any case, consult the FOG, First Osborne Group, on that matter.  I think
they discussed this in their famous FOGHORN.

Assuming that you have a way to convert a file downloaded from MS-Dos to the
CP/M format, you could get yourself kermit for CP/M-80 or CP/M-86, or ZMP
which supports, X, Y, and Z modem as well as having a built in autodialer. I
believe ZMP is available for anonymous FTP from simtel20.army.mil, while you
can always find kermit for just about anything at watsun.cc.columbia.edu.

As you will notice if you get a copy of it, ZMP is a generic program which
must be configured for a specific machine.  I happen to have a version already
configured which I use on my DEC Rainbow 100, so I could email it to you if
you don't want to go through the trouble of assembling, and patching it
yourself.

The program you need is ACOPY.  The latest version is 3.3.  I'm not
sure if it is available in the net archives though.  If not you can find it
on ZeeMachine here in the San Jose area: 408-245-1420.  ACOPY 3.3 does
offer full support of datestamps and use of the archive bit.  The author
of the program calls ZeeMachine regularly and is more than happy to 
assist if you require any help, but I believe ACOPY should meet all of
your needs 'right out of the box'.

You mean you have ZCPR34 and actually prefer vanilla CP/M??
I'm shocked.. :)

Message-ID: <C28A23C833BFE009CC@ucs.uwplatt.edu>

Hello,
 
In regards to the discussion of Z80 emulators for other computers, I have found
a very nice public domain one for the Commodore Amiga computer.  It is written
in 68000 assembler, comes with source, and even emulates the Z80's undocumented
instructions.  I emulates the cp/m environment at the BDOS call level, and
supports drive and user areas via logical names into the Amigados file system.
A trace mode is also provided which displays the contents of all registers
after the execution of each Z80 instruction.
 
I have been able to run DDT and the Bradford printing program without problems
with this emulator.  It will even run the full Bradford which I can't on my
TRS-80 model 4 because of memory limitations.
 
Lance

Hi, as far as I know, there's no GIF-reader for CP/M.  You are welcome to
write one.
 
PASCAL MT+  does not by itself support GSX.  CBASIC does, though. Maybe I can
send you a sample GSX BIOS in Turbo Pascal and Modula source, with an example
program to show you how its done.
 
What computer (what disk format) are you using?

I do hope that everyone here knows about Z-System and all its magic.
NZ-COM is the auto-loading Z-System for CP/M 2.2 computers with
Z80's in them.  Absolutely CP/M compatible, it provides myriad features
and abilities of a modern operating system, multiple commands, shells,
command scripts, termcap, command flow control, and so on.

ZCPR34 command processor and ZRDOS are standard.  ZSDOS and ZDDOS provide
features inculding time/date stamping.  If you think you like CP/M,
you will fall in lust with Z-System.

NZ-COM (and Z3PLUS for CPM 3.0) is available from Sage Microsystems East
and from Alpha Systems for $50.  Most diskette formats available.

We have a money-back guarantee.  Nobody has ever asked for their money back.

    Well, I sent mail to Mike, but since there is more interest I'll post
it here.  The university I attend had two 11/780s back in, I believe, 1984.
One of these had a board in it sold by a company called Bridge something-
or-other.  It had four Z80H's on it running CP/M which users could access.
Any more than four got an emulated CP/M which was slower.  It used VMS
virtual disk files and had transfer utilities.  I can probably get more info
on it from the then-system manager, but I seriously doubt the company is
still in business or selling the boards.

those who have Epson, or Epson compatible printers.

        I created many of the files that are printed, as I have a

Subject: Why does PIP modify S1 of the FCB?
Message-ID: <8234@wrgate.WR.TEK.COM>

This weekend I discovered that the stock Digital Research version of
PIP modifies the S1 field of the destination file FCB after that file
has been created for an append operation. Has anyone ever disassembled
PIP or would otherwise know what is up?

Just to refresh your memory, the S1 field in the FCB is listed as
"reserved" but otherwise unused in a standard Digital Research BDOS.
The trend today is to use this field to save the user number for a
file, making it easier to locate in subsequent accesses. The values
being stored in this field by PIP have no obvious connection to the
files. I thought at first it might be a record count, but the value
didn't seem to follow file size.

Anybody have any clue?

Jon Lexau asked:

>>    - what exactly does the parameter block pointed to by the "seldsk"

This is too long a subject for me to answer here, but there are good books
that have all the details on this.  I recommend especially the following:

        Inside CP/M
        David E. Cortesi
        CBS College Publishing
        Holt, Rinehart and Winston
        ISBN: 0-03-059558-4
        QA76.6.C665

Cortesi wrote a number of books in this series on other operating systems,
including CP/M-Plus.

Briefly, the SELDSK call returns with HL pointing to what is called the Disk
Parameter Header (DPH).  The DPH is a table of further addresses of system
components, including that of the Disk Parameter Block (DPH).  The latter
tells how the logical disk is set up (number of sectors per track, size of
each extent, number of directory entries, number of system tracks, etc.

Hi, as far as I know, there's no GIF-reader for CP/M.  You are welcome to
write one.
 
PASCAL MT+  does not by itself support GSX.  CBASIC does, though. Maybe I can
send you a sample GSX BIOS in Turbo Pascal and Modula source, with an example
program to show you how its done.

Subject: Re: Kermit for CP/M
Message-ID: <7522@tamsun.tamu.edu>

The PCPI interface with the SSC (or equivalent) is a bit more complicated
than the "ordinary" Apple CP/M (as kludged by MacroSloth).

It involves passing commands and data between the 6502 and the Z80 (each of
which live in their own little worlds.

I am not personally familiar with the ordinary Kermit program itself.
When I use the kermit protocol, it's via Dave Goodenough's QTERM v4.3e.

The drivers for QTERM for the Applicard/Starcard/ACE-80 should be very
instructive in how that system operates and you should probably be able to
lift the individual routines form input, output, ready, DTR on/off, etc.
right out of the QTERM overlay and patch it in to the Kermit overlay.

That is, in fact how I brought ZMP 1.5 up on my Apple //e with PCPI
Applicard as no pre-written driver existed--only the blank supplied by
Ron Murray.  If you go that route, you will have to convert Dave's
ZSM assembly syntax to something more convetional (ASM, MAC, M80, etc)
but I did it with little or no trouble and I'm don't do that sort of
thing very often.

Contact me if you have any questions on PCPI stuff in general.  If you
would like more info on QTERM, talk to me or Dave Goodenough (dg@pallio.UUCP)
or you can find out more by sending mail to:

rna@pallio.UUCP

put the following lines in your message:

/send help to <your address>
/send index to <your address>


I could mail you the individual overlay to QTERM so you could study it.

Hope this helps.

Brent,

CP/M was the operating system before MS-DOS and there are a large 
number of us out here who cut our teeth on micros using CP/M by
exploring computing with it.  These days we use emulators or Z80
coprocessors in order to make changes to code that was based upon
CP/M development tools.

There are also a number of CP/M systems out there that are
faithfully serving owners running word processors, spreadsheets and
even some databasing.

Message-ID: <1992Jan11.021221.2036@weyrich.UUCP>

Hello all --

A long while back I saw a description of a single-board computer motherboard
that had all of the following on a single board (without daughter boards
sticking up):

	Z-80 processor
	several serial ports
	parallel port
	floppy disk controller
	room on the board for at least 64K of memory (128 K Ideal)
	preferably with CP/M included.

The boards I have in mind are probably obsolete, and there might be a
warehouse full of them somewhere. I'd like to find about 10 of these
boards real cheap.

Also, I'm looking for an extra Morrow MD-11 that I can use for spare parts.

If you have some of these for sale (or even know where to find them),
please send me e-mail.

Thanks,

orville

If you do not have FTP access to SIMTEL20, files may be ordered by
e-mail from LISTSERV@VM1.NODAK.EDU or LISTSERV@VM.ECS.RPI.EDU.

           If you are on BITNET: LISTSERV@NDSUVM1
                                 LISTSERV@RPIECS

   If your mailer knows domains: listserv@vm1.nodak.edu
				 listserv@vm.ecs.rpi.edu

If your mailer wants bang paths: uunet!vm1.nodak.edu!listserv
				 uunet!vm.ecs.rpi.edu!listserv

If you use bang paths, substitute your nearest neighbor which is also
on the Internet for uunet in the examples above.  Some examples are:
ames, decvax, decwrl, harvard, hplabs, nosc, rutgers, sharkey, sun,
ucbvax, ucsd, udel, uw-beaver, wuarchive.

Send this command to the server to get its help file:

GET PDGET HELP

Sample command (which gets our catalog of CP/M files):

/PDGET MAIL PD:<CPM.FILEDOCS>SIMCPM.ARK UUENCODE

These commands should be sent as the body of a regular email message.
Do not include a signature because it confuses the server.  If you
have xxdecode, you may wish to specify XXENCODE instead of UUENCODE to
avoid character translation problems.

Comments, questions, and suggestions should be directed to the LISTSERV
manager at one of these addresses, depending on which server you normally
use:

                    Internet                  BITNET

Please do NOT send your comment or question about the servers to SIMTEL20.
However, if you wish to report a program bug or to request information

                 How to upload to SIMTEL20

I have received many inquiries about why SIMTEL20 does not publish
instructions for uploading files for those who wish to submit their
programs.  The reason is that we prefer to coordinate uploads by
having contributors contact us first so we can check to make sure the
program is not already in the repository.

File uploads are accepted via FTP using a special uploading account,
via e-mail using a special mailbox which does not interfere with
regular correspondence, and via modem at Detroit Download Central
(313) 885-3956 (300-14400bps 212/V.22bis/HST/V.32/V.32bis/V.42bis/MNP).

If you have a program to upload please send e-mail to me with a short
description of the files you wish to submit.  Please do *not* send
files to my mailbox.  Because of local management policy, SIMTEL20
does not accept games for submission to the archives unless they are
strictly educational.

Thanks to all those who are actively supporting the respository by
helping us keep up to date with the latest programs.

                     THE SIMTEL20 ARCHIVES

OVERVIEW

There is a colossal amount of free public domain and shareware
software for the CP/M, PCDOS/MSDOS, Macintosh, and UNIX operating
systems, and for the DoD standard programming language, Ada, in
several archives on WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL (IP host 192.88.110.20),
a DECSYSTEM-20 running the TOPS-20 operating system at White Sands
Missile Range, New Mexico.  Archives of correspondence for several
mailing lists are also available.

    [SIMTEL20 is a contraction of SIMulation and TELeprocessing, the
    name of the branch that originally purchased the machine and in
    whose building the system still resides, and the "20" in
    DECSYSTEM-20.  The convention of including the "20" in some form
    or another was popular with other DECSYSTEM-20 systems at the time
    SIMTEL20 was named, such as MIT-XX at MIT and SCORE at Stanford.]

You can obtain these files using the InterNet file transfer protocol,
FTP (described in a following paragraph), with user-name "anonymous".
For a login password, use "guest", your host-name, or any other string
of printing characters.  Throughout this message, FTP examples are
given in a GENERIC syntax.  You will have to consult either local
documentation or your friendly system wizard to learn the actual
syntax used with your local mainframe operating system.  For the sake
of brevity, the full host name "WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL" will be
dropped from further references to SIMTEL20 in this discussion.  Also
please note that square brackets may be used in place of angle brackets
in referring to directory names.  For example, pd1:[msdos.filedocs]
is the same as pd1:<msdos.filedocs>

There are many helpful files in the default ANONYMOUS ftp directory.
Please look at these if you have need for further information on
specific collections.

To obtain directory listings, connect to SIMTEL20 via FTP and get
these files:

  pd1:<msdos>msdos.crclst
  pd1:<pc-blue>pc-blue.crclst
  pd2:<cpm>cpm.crclst
  pd2:<cpmug>cpmug.crclst
  pd2:<sigm>sigm.crclst
  pd8:<hz100>hz100.crclst
  pd9:<macintosh>macintosh.crclst
  pd8:<misc>misc.crclst
  pd6:<unix-c>unix-c.crclst
  pd7:<ada>ada.crc

There is also a comma-delimited directory listing in each top-level
directory, FILES.IDX, which is suitable for importing into a database
program.  This file may be of greater use than the crclst files
because it can be compared against an earlier version of the same file
to produce a complete list of files added and deleted from the
archives.  Using the comma-delimited fields it is possible to build a
script for FTP to maintain a parallel archive.  FILES.IDX can be
printed or displayed with a simple BASIC program.  For more information
see PD1:<MSDOS.FILEDOCS>AAAREAD.ME.

The <CPM>, <MSDOS>, and <MACINTOSH> archives are the ones to watch for
the very latest offerings, as they are updated frequently.

The <CPMUG>, <SIGM> and <PC-BLUE> archives contain software distributed
by the CP/M Users Group, the SIG/M Users Group and the PC-Blue Users
Group respectively.  This software is available on diskettes from the
associated user groups, and the archives are updated as new volumes
are issued.  The <PC-BLUE> archive contains software for the IBM-PC
and similar machines.

The <MSDOS> archives also contain software for the MSDOS and PCDOS
operating systems; but these archives are locally managed, and
therefore are updated more frequently than the <PC-BLUE> archive.

The <UNIX-C> archive contains a variety of UNIX tools.  Those which
apply specifically to CP/M are in the directory <UNIX-C.CPM>.

The <ADA> archive is growing rapidly. Information about this archive
is in directory PD7:<ADA.GENERAL>.  In general, the archived software
is very good, having been worked-over and refined by many users.  The
documentation and comments tend to be complete and informative.

Files in all of these archives can be obtained using the FTP procedures
described in this message.

PLEASE NOTE:  Due to the large number of files available, the archive
maintainers cannot possibly attempt to validate the proper operation of
the various programs.  When a program bug is reported, immediate action
is taken to either correct the error or remove the offending program
from the archives.  Still, users must understand that all archive
programs are offered AS IS, and the archive maintainers specifically
disclaim any liability should these programs malfunction or cause
damage, incidental or otherwise.  When testing ANY new software, be
certain that all information stored on disk is backed-up before you
start, so that you can recover if files are damaged or erased.  This is
particularly true if you have a hard disk, in which case malfunctions
can be spectacularly disasterous.

FILE TYPES

Files are stored in two formats: Text files such as those with names
that end with DOC, HEX, INF and ASM are sometimes stored as ASCII
files, but sometimes these files are stored in binary compressed
form.  Binary storage is also used for executable (COM and EXE) and
library/archive files  (LBR and ARC).  All binary data are stored as
four 8-bit bytes per 36-bit SIMTEL20 word, with the low-order four
bits of each word filled with zeros.  If such a file is interpreted
as a contiguous string, as will happen if a straight binary transfer
is made to a 16 or 32-bit UNIX machine, the four zero filler-bits per
36-bit group will cause rather bizarre and frustrating results.

For information on ARC, ARK, LZH, ZIP, ZOO, LBR, squeezed and crunched files,
get PD2:<CPM.STARTER-KIT>00-FILES.DOC and/or PD1:<MSDOS.STARTER>00-FILES.DOC.

Although the type of storage used for a particular file can usually be
inferred from the file-name, this is not always true.  It is a good idea
to check the appropriate "crclst" of "idx" file to ascertain the storage
format used for each file of interest.  Now, and for the foreseeable
future, storage formats for files in the <SIGM>, <CPMUG> and <PC-BLUE>
archives can be determined from their "generation numbers", as shown by
the FTP directory command.  For example, the FTP command:

  dir pd1:<pc-blue.vol001>

will yield results of the form:

  -CATALOG.001.2
  ABSTRACT.001.2
  BW.ASM.2
  BW.BAS.1
  BW.EXE.1
  COLOR.ASM.2
  COLOR.BAS.1
  COLOR.EXE.1
  ...and so on

All files with names ending in ".1" are stored in binary format, and
those with names ending in ".2" are stored in ASCII.  This relationship
will continue to apply for files in the <SIGM>, <CPMUG> and <PC-BLUE>
archives until further notice.

WARNING: Because the public domain archives on SIMTEL20 consume a huge
amount of disk space, storage capacity will be conserved by the
greatest practical use of libraries, archives, crunched and squeezed
files, all of which are stored in binary format.  If you cannot
properly transfer binary files, you are going to be VERY FRUSTRATED!
If you need help, please contact your local system wizard and provide
him/her with a copy of this message.  Having done that, if you are
still unable to make things work correctly, send a message to
Action@WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL and someone will try to help you.
Please provide the following information:

 1. Machine and operating system  (e.g., VAX-11/780, 4.3 BSD UNIX)
 2. Network software in use  (e.g., 3-Com UNET)
 3. Complete list of available FTP commands  (e.g., GET, PUT, etc.)

Important files in the <CPMUG> and <PC-BLUE> archives are the
CATALOG files. These files, which are stored in ASCII, contain the
"-CATALOG.nnn" files from all the volumes of their respective archives.
To obtain these composite catalog files, connect to SIMTEL20 via FTP
and get these files:

  pd2:<cpmug>cpmug.cat
  pd1:<pc-blue.vol000>pcblue.cat

Similar files exist for the <SIGM> archive, but they are stored in
squeezed form.  These files, when unsqueezed, yields SIG0.CAT and
SIG1.CAT (the catalog).

  pd2:<sigm.vol000>sig0.cqt
  pd2:<sigm.vol000>sig1.cqt

(NOTE: That's "L-and-three-zeros" in "vol000")

FILE TRANSFER VIA FTP

FTP stands for File Transfer Protocol, a formalized procedure for
moving files among machines on the Defense Data Network (DDN) and other
networks that connect with the DDN.  The protocol is implemented by a
program often called FTP.  The different mainframe operating systems
implement FTP with variations in command syntax.  Some systems have the
remote-file-name precede the local-file-name in the command.  Others
reverse this order.  Some versions have the whole command on a single
input line, while others use multiple lines.  Read the documentation
for your local system, or consult a friendly system wizard for the
details of your local FTP command syntax.

UNIX users can do something like "man ftp" for on-line instructions.
However, not all UNIX FTP programs are called "ftp", so you may have
to snoop around in the system directories or ask a system wizard for
the correct local name to use with the "man" command.  ITS users can
do ":INFO FTP", and "HELP FTP" works on TOPS-20 and some other
operating systems.  I will be happy to update this message with
pointers to other sources of on-line documentation if they are sent
to w8sdz@WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL.

FTP transfers from SIMTEL20 can be made with user-name "anonymous".
Use GUEST for the password.  For anonymous logins, SIMTEL20 supports
the FTP "change working directory" command.  (Your local syntax may
be something like CD, or CWD).  Ignore the message which may appear
that prompts you to enter a password.  This command allows you to
specify a default SIMTEL20 directory to be used for all file
retrievals, and thereby relieves you from having to repeatedly type
"pdx:<whatever>" as part of each filename.  For example, you can do
something like this:

  cd pd1:<msdos.goodstuff>
  get filename-1
  get filename-2
  ...and so on

instead of using the longer filename forms shown in previous examples.

Users of TOPS-10, TENEX, or TOPS-20 systems can use "image" or "paged"
mode for ALL transfers.  UNIX and other users must use "ascii" mode for
ASCII files, and "type tenex" or "type L 8" mode for binary files.

All aspects of the FTP process for UNIX machines have been automated
to a high degree by two programs in directory PD8:<MISC.UNIX>. With
these programs, a simple command like "sh autoftp30.sh mylist &" can
be run in no-hangup background mode to transfer multiple files from
SIMTEL20 without the user remaining logged-in on the local system.
For more information, get the file PD8:<MISC.UNIX>AUTOFTP30.TAR-Z, a
compressed tar archive.  After transferring it to your Unix host,
rename to autoftp30.tar.Z, uncompress, and extract with tar.  Also
see BATCHFTP102.TAR-Z which is an enhanced version of autoftp.

MAILING LIST CORRESPONDENCE ARCHIVES

Copies of correspondence for several mailing lists are kept on SIMTEL20
in directories with names of the form PD2:<ARCHIVES.KEYWORD>, where
"KEYWORD" has been chosen to indicate the associated mailing list.  At
present, the following correspondence archives are available:

   mailing list       mail archive filename
  ---------------     ---------------------
  ADA-SW              PD2:<ARCHIVES.ADA-SW>
  AMETHYST-USERS      PD2:<ARCHIVES.AMETHYST>
  INFO-68K            PD2:<ARCHIVES.68K>
  INFO-APPLE          PD2:<ARCHIVES.APPLE>
  INFO-CPM            PD2:<ARCHIVES.CPM>
  INFO-FORTH          PD2:<ARCHIVES.FORTH>
  INFO-IBMPC          PD2:<ARCHIVES.IBMPC>
  INFO-MICRO          PD2:<ARCHIVES.MICRO>
  INFO-MODEMS         PD2:<ARCHIVES.MODEMS>
  INFO-MODEMXX        PD2:<ARCHIVES.MODEMXX>
  INFO-MODULA-2       PD2:<ARCHIVES.MODULA-2>
  INFO-PASCAL         PD2:<ARCHIVES.PASCAL>
  INFO-XENIX310       PD2:<ARCHIVES.XENIX310>
  INFO-XMODEM         PD2:<ARCHIVES.XMODEM>
  NORTHSTAR-USERS     PD2:<ARCHIVES.NORTHSTAR>
  UNIX-SW             PD2:<ARCHIVES.UNIX-SW>
  VIDEOTECH           PD2:<ARCHIVES.VIDEOTECH>

Descriptions of these and other mailing lists can be obtained via FTP
with anonymous login (as for SIMTEL20) from FTP.NISC.SRI.COM.  Ask for
the file netinfo/interest-groups (an ASCII file).  And please note,
this is NOT on SIMTEL20.

File names for SIMTEL20 mailing list correspondence archives have two
forms.  For example, in PD2:<ARCHIVES.CPM>, which holds the INFO-CPM
correspondence (the "INFO-" is assumed), the forms are: yymm.n-TXT or
yymm.n-TXT-Z.  Files with names ending in -Z were compressed with a
Unix compress-compatible program.  The characters "yymm" in the file
names are the digits of the year and month of the messages in each
particular file.  The "n" was incremented as overflowed 150 disk pages
(approximately 375K).  The current month's correspondence is kept in
CPM-ARCHIV.TXT, which is constantly growing as new messages arrive.
There may also temporarily exist files named CURRENT.n-TXT, which hold
the overflow of the current month's messages when CPM-ARCHIV.TXT is
split into monthly files.  Although INFO-CPM has been used as an
example here, the same naming scheme is used for the other mailing list
files as well.  For a complete list of available files, connect to
SIMTEL20 via FTP and do this:

  dir PD2:<ARCHIVES>

You will receive a list of names of the form:

  KEYWORD.DIRECTORY.n

where "n" is one or more digits.  For example, the INFO-CPM listing
currently appears as "CPM.DIRECTORY.1"  To then get a list of files in
a particular archive, do this:

  dir PD2:<ARchives.keyword>

where "keyword" (for example, "cpm") is chosen from the preceding list,
and the word "directory" and the number "n" are not used.  At present,
all of these files are stored in ASCII.

CRR 1.40 will answer this need of yours.

I guess you have a previous version of CRR from your second post.

CRR now supports XRS and QWK mail (QWK using a converter).

I've not posted it on SIMTEL-20 as I'm not sure if they're still taking
submissions. Look for it on bulletin boards as CRR0140.ZIP.

There is also KERMIT. I have a version of Kermit that I taylored for the
Morrow MD-11, but you do have to know how the SIO works on your machine
(or else just try the verious versions available until you get one to
work). I would offer my KERMIT source if my machine were up, but it seems
to be having trouble booting from the HD right now. If you really need this,
maybe I can try a bit harder to get the machine up long enough to pull the
KERMIT source off of my backup archive.

  Nope, The 40col screen is not affected by booting CP/M after compiling it
with use$fast.  The code that I've looked at (briefly - I like 6502 better)
looked like it was saving the system speed (at 53296 regular 128 mode -- 4get
the hex address) and toggling to 1mhz mode and then doing the opposite after
some section of code.  However, apparently the system speed is never set to 2/4
mhz and so useless swapping is done.  I tried adding in a set routine but it
bombed right before it gave me the command prompt.

  Okay, (After checking the C128 programmer's reference guide). The C128 gets
its 4mhz clock from the VIC chip during AEC low (in other words, it's working
1/2 the time) .... Now, my question is why is use$fast in there???

I just bought a couple of RC Partner 186 systems. They run CCPM-86 3.1 and
CDOS 4.1 and uses IBM AT and some cpm-86 floppy format.

Is the AT floppy & cpm-86 formats a general pheomenon for CPM-86 machines or is it like with CPM-80, everyone has it own ?

Has DR released newer version of these op-systems ?

So...i'm looking for the GEM and some CPM86,CCPM86 and CDOS software
the general and some special for the RC Partner. 


   AND If someone has the same beast or info, please contact me.

Message-ID: <1992Jan22.044606.21851@mnemosyne.cs.du.edu>

Hey all,

    Well, I got Qterm up and running on my Attache (thanks Dave!), and the
VT100 emulation is great!  There's only one problem.  The clearscreen built
into the Bios seems to be pretty slow, because the system drops characters
at both 1200 and 2400 baud after clearing the screen.

    I tried using termcap on the unix side to put in a delay after the
clearscreen is sent, but all my connections are over the network long
distances, and the stuff gets bunched together anyway.

    So here's my question: does anyone, by any chance, have a faster clear-
screen routine for the Attache?  Or is the Bios routine already as fast as
they get?  If I can just get this one problem fixed, I'll be really happy!

    Speaking of Bios, did Otrona ever sell the source, by any chance?  I
kinda doubt it since it seems to be a rather complicated one.

Subject: Get a Real emulator!

        For all those who have used 22nice, or Z80mu5.  These are nive
CP/M emulators, except they have one major flaw.  No Zsystem support.
I have come across a z80 emulator called ZSIM12.ZIP on Simtel20.  This
is a simple z80 emulator, but it can BOOT an osborne disc.  If you have
Zsystem on an osborne DSDD or SSDD it will boot the system and put you
into Zsystem (or ZCPR3).  I have heard this is truly a 100% CP/M compatible
solution.  You don't have access to your PC's hard drive, but you do get
a emulated ramdisk set up as drive B: of about 455K.  In the the Ramdisk
file that the system boots, are a host of the most used utilities in cpm, such
as VDE , Small-c compiler, a macro assembler, linker, debugger.  And some
docs.  And if you want to roll your own drive parameter to support say KayproII
or Royal Alphatronic, then it will let you very easily.

So take a look in the Simtel archives in the MSDOS directory
PD1:<msdos.emulators> for the file ZSIM12.ZIP.
Take care.

When I was looking for a copy of Kermit to run on my Kaypro II (83),
I got a copy from Simtel that was patched for the Kaypro I.  The
program runs reasonably well on my machine but I have become curious
about the history of the Kaypro I.  I have never heard of this machine
before and I was wondering if someone could give me some information
about it (hardware/software specs etc).  Thanks!

Subject: Re: Kermit for CP/M
Message-ID: <7522@tamsun.tamu.edu>

The PCPI interface with the SSC (or equivalent) is a bit more complicated
than the "ordinary" Apple CP/M (as kludged by MacroSloth).

It involves passing commands and data between the 6502 and the Z80 (each of
which live in their own little worlds.

I am not personally familiar with the ordinary Kermit program itself.
When I use the kermit protocol, it's via Dave Goodenough's QTERM v4.3e.

The drivers for QTERM for the Applicard/Starcard/ACE-80 should be very
instructive in how that system operates and you should probably be able to
lift the individual routines form input, output, ready, DTR on/off, etc.
right out of the QTERM overlay and patch it in to the Kermit overlay.

That is, in fact how I brought ZMP 1.5 up on my Apple //e with PCPI
Applicard as no pre-written driver existed--only the blank supplied by
Ron Murray.  If you go that route, you will have to convert Dave's
ZSM assembly syntax to something more convetional (ASM, MAC, M80, etc)
but I did it with little or no trouble and I'm don't do that sort of
thing very often.

Contact me if you have any questions on PCPI stuff in general.  If you
would like more info on QTERM, talk to me or Dave Goodenough (dg@pallio.UUCP)
or you can find out more by sending mail to:

rna@pallio.UUCP

put the following lines in your message:

/send help to <your address>
/send index to <your address>


I could mail you the individual overlay to QTERM so you could study it.

Hope this helps.

Hello all --

A long while back I saw a description of a single-board computer motherboard
that had all of the following on a single board (without daughter boards
sticking up):

	Z-80 processor
	several serial ports
	parallel port
	floppy disk controller
	room on the board for at least 64K of memory (128 K Ideal)
	preferably with CP/M included.

The boards I have in mind are probably obsolete, and there might be a
warehouse full of them somewhere. I'd like to find about 10 of these
boards real cheap.

Also, I'm looking for an extra Morrow MD-11 that I can use for spare parts.

If you have some of these for sale (or even know where to find them),
please send me e-mail.

Thanks,

orville

	Greetings. I have some ~83 hardware that's looking for a new home.
	Mainly, I have a CADO motherboard (about 4 square feet!), the
	hard-drive interface board, personality (sp?) module, expansion
	board (2 serial ports), and a BUNCH of binders with FULL
	schematics and theory of operation. 

	All of the above can be yours for:

	1) You pay shipping (shouldn't be too much)
	2) You transfer 2 8" Sol-20 (SSDD) disks to non-8" format :-)

	If can't do #2, then:

	2) send me a program for the Sol-20 which can send stuff to the
	serial port. Why do I ask? (Yes, I know what CP/M is... :-)

	When I do a "STAT DEV:" I get 4 lines telling me that EVERYTHING
	is pointing to TTY. I write stuff to LST, I get it on screen.
	Send it to CON, same thing. And, no, assigning it to something
	else does not work.

	Or, send me a card (S100 based) and a small 8080A program which
	will dump files to a serial port on THAT card. I'm grasping at
	straws here, as I have for the last year...

	Take care.

Hello fellow CP/Mers:

Re Kermit for CP/M systems:  The Columbia University Kermit for CP/M
systems has been configured for several incarnations of Apple II
computers with a Z80 Softcard installed.  To make an executable
(.COM-file) for one of these Kermits, log in to Cu Kermit's home machine
"Watsun" via anonymous ftp (the hostname is "watsun.cc.columbia.edu" and
I believe that translates to an ip of 128.59.39.2).  The CP/M Kermit
files are in the directory ~kermit/a/cp*.*.  What one does is to get the
system-independent file "cpsker.hex" (Intel hex-record format) and one
of the system dependent files cpvxxx.hex (xxx for a specific machine)
and MLOAD them together to form a working KERMIT.COM, as in A>MLOAD
KERMIT=CPSKER.HEX,CPVTEL.HEX to build Kermit for the Telcon Zorba. 

Now then:  The filenames (filetype is always .hex) for the Apple II
flavors of CP/M Kermit are given below.  Grab one of these hex modules
and combine with CPSKER.HEX to get a working Kermit.  One might also
want to get "cpkerm.doc" which is documentation (mostly correct).  The
few exceptions where the doc is wrong I'll be glad to help anyone with. 

Happy KERMITting!

I purchased the Kaypro1 that that version of Kermit was compiled for in 1987
by mail from a distress merchandise seller.  The unit was in the same type 
of case that all portable Kaypro's was shipped in.  It has double sided double
density floppys that give the machine a storage capacity of 390K per disk.  I
found in all cases that it could run anything that had been configured for any
Kaypro.  I ran software from 83 vintage Kaypro II on it with no problems.  The
Z-80 apparently runs at 4 MHZ.

The version of Kermit is set up as a Kaypro II Kermit with the exception of the
sign-on screen which I customized for the Kaypro1.  I put it in SIMTEL20 to 
simplify others use of Kermit without the hassle of assembling and loading the
software.  Injoy!

Is the ZCPR package written for the Z80 microprocessor or the least common
denominator, the 8080?

I mentioned Tilmann Reh, designer of the CPU280 (a Z280 based computer), 
in an earlier reply to Louis and gave Tilmann's postal address. I notice 
he is also on the Internet at "tilmann.reh@hrz.uni-siegen.dph.de'.

The CPU280 is the computer Jay Sage say demonstrated during his trip last 
summer to Germany. Jay was very excited when we talked. This is evidently 
quite a piece of machinery.

Louis, there is a fellow in Germany that makes a Z280 computer called the 
CPU280. The November/December issue of The Computer Journal had an 
article by the designer describing it. Contact Tilmann Reh at In der 
Grossenback 64, W-5900 Siegen Germany for more information.

Sorry, I don't know of any plug-in boards to upgrade to the 280.

I think that the CP/M-86 format is a 5 1/4 " version of the 8" format
used with their Piccolo machines (Z80).  Stick to the AT format because
*nobody* can read the CP/M format.  (Hallmark of RegneCentralen -- we
are compatible with *noone*)

Hard to tell.  You might want to ask RegneCentralen before they vanish,
as they are on the net.  I got a very nice treatment by writing to
"postmaster@rci.dk", and you might as well get the latest editions of
whatever they have left.

I think you are out of luck.  Not much has been written and it is hard
to get.  Generic software is a little easier -- try on simtel20.

BTW:  Happy to hear that the machine is still in use.  It is very nice
to work with, especially with the screenscroll, but it is not
IBM-compatible. 

Good luck and happy hacking

Let me second John's comment. Harold is the editor. Willis Cook, Sypko 
Andreae and other Morrow folk appear regularly. It is about 12 pages of 
good information and fun reading.

The Mor-Atlanta News is the newsletter of the Morrow Atlanta Users Group. 
Some may recognize the players from BAMUA.

In fact, ZCPR3.0 has an I8080 conditional and can be assembled without
any Z80 code.  This was the last one.  ZCPR3.3 and 3.4 require Z80.

Subject: Unidentified system ...
Message-ID: <1259@spam.ua.oz>

Hello,
  I am wondering if you could help me identify a computer.
I found it while reorganising a storeroom at work ... it
has the name 'sirius' on the front, and two 5 1/4" floppy
drives. Looking at it, it seems to be the right age to
be a CP/M system, circa 1981. Sound familiar to anyone
(I might take a closer look tomorrow - see if there's any
more identification on it ... )

(My Microbee with 3.5" drive looks positively sophisticated
compared to this system, btw :-)

Thanks in advance,

Fello CP/Mers:

Please forgive the following post to Paul Martin, the author of CRR, but
I can't get his "pm.nowster@tharr.uucp" address to work from this site.

Hi, Paul.
First, let me congratulate you for a first-rate product.  I was
pleasantly surprised to discover that CRR worked right
"out-of-the-box", so-to-speak, the **first** time!  Believe me, I
intend to register it with you as soon as I get some spare cash (kinda
cash-starve at the moment).  I have one **very** small bug report and a
sugestion.
When I bring up CRR and give it a date that is a Saturday (e.g.,
25-Jan-1992), the 3-letter abbreviation for the day on the opening
screen is "Mon" rather than "Sat".  Other days appear to work
correctly.
Also, when replying to a message, after the editor is exited, the
"Area" heading is spoken twice (am blind and use a speech synthesizer).
 Don't know if this shows up in print; suspect not.
Now for the suggestion:  It would be nice to have a separate utility to
convert from QWK packets to XRS packets that could be run on virgin
floppies (without having to have CRR & friends on the floppy to which
XRS packets are to be written).  Please do not take the built-in
converter (i.e., the .CHN file) out of CRR; I'm just advocating an
additional utility
Anyway, thanks for a fine product.

They seem to have vanished or changed their name, as inquiry of the

   The Zi/Tel Group of the Boston Computer Society has received a donation of
a large amount of CP/M software and hardware and other items (including some
PC software and HP41 calculator accessories).  In return for contributions to
help fund user group activities, we would like to find new homes for these
items where they would be put to good use.  You may communicate your offers
in any of the following ways:

    (1) by leaving a message on the Zi/Tel BBS in the Boston area
        at 617-965-7046
    (2) by leaving a message on Jay Sage's Z-Node at 617-965-7259 (logon
        password is DDT)
    (3) leaving GEnie mail for JAY.SAGE
    (4) sending email to Jay Sage on Internet at the following
        address: SAGE @ LL.MIT.EDU
    (5) sending mail to Jay Sage at
                1435 Centre Street
                Newton Centre, MA 02159-2469
    (6) telephoning Jay Sage at 617-965-3552 evenings (Mon - Thur) or
        all day Sunday or weekday days at 617-981-4704

The last method will probably be the least reliable and may take several
tries.  The email methods (first four methods above) would be best.  When it
comes time to send money, send a check payable to "BCS ZI/TEL" to the Newton
Centre address listed above.

   Now for the inventory of items!  Some of these items will make sense only
for people within driving distance of my house.

                     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   First, there are boxes and boxes of HARD-SECTORED diskettes:

     18   boxes of 8" 32-sector hard-sector diskettes
     17   boxes of 5.25" 10-sector hard-sector diskettes
      7   boxes of 5.25" 16-sector hard-sector diskettes

                     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   Then there is some miscellaneous hardware:

     1    Televideo 802H (CP/M with hard disk)
     1    Diablo 620 daisy-wheel printer, serial
     1    NEC Spinwriter 7730
     1    NEC Spinwriter 3500R
     1    Soroc 135 terminal
     2    Kaypros that need work (probably replacement of
            a disk drive -- certainly good for parts)
     1    mint condition Kaypro 2 with ComRiter diasy-wheel
            printer, original manuals

                     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   Next, there is the software.  We will start with the CP/M items.  There
are lots of copies of MicroPro packages in sealed, shrink-wrapped boxes. 
Most were originally for Apple CP/M.  I opened one of the boxes and was able
to read the diskettes using Uniform and my special disk controller.  Thus,
there will be no trouble converting the contents over to just about any other
CP/M format.  The programs appear to be complete, though I have not yet tried
running that copy of WordStar 3.31 to see if the installation program has all
the features.  If not, the addresses and overlay files are readily available.

     12   WordStar 3.31
      9   MailMerge 3.30
      2   SpellStar 3.30
      3   WordStar Professional (WordStar 3.31 plus SpellStar 3.30
          plus MailMerge 3.30 plus IndexStar 1.01)
      1   WordStar - MailMerge combined package

   The additional CP/M software items include:

      1   Z-Term for Apple CP/M Softcard
      1   Osborne: Documate-Plus, Spellguard, Supersort, DataStar
      1   Osborne Personal Pearl
      1   Infocom Zork III (Kaypro II)
      1   Infocom Cutthroats (Kaypro II)

   We also have a few packages for PCs:

      1   RBase 4000 relational database management system (DOS)
      1   Borland Sprint wordprocessor (DOS)
      1   Samna Plus IV wordprocessor (DOS)
      1   Open Access (integrated package: graphics, spreadsheet,
            wordprocessing, and more) (DOS)
      2   TK Solver (equation solver) (DOS)
      1   Concurrent CP/M with Windows (CP/M-86)
      3   Curse of Ra
      2   Upper Reaches of Apshai

                     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   We also have tons (almost literally) of CP/M and other books.  Here is a

   We have a complete (and apparently brand new) Sony SMC70 computer,
including a Trinitron COLOR MONITOR!  (Actually, we have two of the computers
but only one monitor.)  It also includes 28 (!!) different pieces of software
(multiple copies of many).  Contrary to what I thought originally, the SMC70
uses industry-standard 3.5" diskettes (not Sony's own 3" design that failed
to gain acceptance), so there is a chance that the diskettes can be read
using Uniform on a PC with a 3.5" drive.  I don't have such a machine handy
at the moment, so I have not been able to try that out.  If the diskettes can
be read this way, then the software packages might be usable on other
computers.
