Subject: --- PD units conversion routine wanted ---
To: info-cpm@AMSAA.ARPA
Reply-To: nep.pgelhausen@AMES-VMSB.ARPA


I am looking for a public domain program/routine that will
provide units converstion based on a data file (so that I
can add more units when needed...i.e.: when I find out what
that a fortnight is 2 weeks, I can add it conveniently.)

I would like to give the routine the units I have, and the
units I want & recieve back the equation to do the conversion
OR an indication that there is no conversion (volts into days).

There is a UN*X program that does something similar, however
I need the source, and would like public domain because this
is going into an application.

Source in C would be preferable, I could deal with converting
if needed.

Any help for me?

I have smallc version 2.1, and am having some problems with files.
I have a Royal Alphatronic PC (and still can't find another one
in existance), with 56K and am using L80 and M80.  When I try to
open a file with fopen and write to it, I get trash on the screen.
Also, I/O redirection via ">" and "<" works sometimes, other times
it simply reboots the system.  Other than this, everything works
fine.  I would really appreciate some assistance and/or any useful
programs anyone has for small-C.

Also, is version 2.1 the latest version?  The one I have is from
Simtel in pd:<cpm.smallc21>.

Quoting without permission from TUG (Turbo User Group) Lines,
Vol #7:

"Turbo Modula Lives!

At least in a beta-test version, under CP/M-80.  I saw it running
at SOG IV in Bend, Oregon in July.  A demonstration and talk were
given by Mike Weisert of Borland, a memter of the software desing
team adssigned to the development of the Turbo Modula Toolbox.
...
The beta version demonstrated was quite impressive, using incrementatl
compilation to generate intermediate-level "M" code that can be executed
in memory by the Modula-2 interpreter, eliminating the need for native
code compilation, linking and execution just to test routines.  If
you stop on an error, you can return to the editor, fix the error
-- and >resume compilation from where you left off!<

Once the memory-compiled version is working, you can re-compile to
native code.

The version demonstrated includes several new options on the main
menu as well, including file management (copy, delete, etc.) and
file printing.   It even includes an option that will enable the
compiler to distinguish between upper- and lower-case text.

Compilation and execution seppd anre good, and as good or better
than more expensive implementations of Modula-2 now on the market.
Like Turbo Pascal, the beta version of modula-2 seems to write a 
large runtime package into a compiled file, creating somewhat of an 
overhead for smaller programs.  Since the heaviest use of Modula will 
probably be for developing large programs, this shouldn't present a 
real burden, except for those with memory limitations.

Development of the 16-bit version of Turbo Modula is said to be a 
little behind the 8-bit version, and there's no word on which will be 
released first, of if they will be repeased together.  Perhaps by 
Christmas?..."

For those who would say that 8-bit CP/M is dead, I present the 
following edited exchange of messages from CompuServe...

Sb: A Z-SYSTEM Testimonial 
Fm: Peter O.E. Bekker 74106,1430
To: All

I have just now emerged from 10 grueling hours worth of eye-crossing 
(glossing) installation work - but am proud to report the SUCCESSFUL 
implementation of ZCPR3 and Echelon's ZRDOS on a Kaypro 4-84.  In 
short, a fully functional Z-SYSTEM.

Without qualification I can say the Z-SYSTEM is a MAJOR boon to 8-bit 
computing.

Rick Conn, Joe Wright and the folks at ECHELON are quite definately 
pioneers who have picked-up the ball from Digital Research and run with 
it...far beyond the goal post.  (At first blush this would seem silly -
who would want to run much past the goal post? That's probably what DRI 
asked itself..lo those many years ago.) Well - had DRI only answered 
its own question with the same kind of vision that made it famous in 
the first place, BIG BLUE and its conspirators might not have muscled 
it out of prominence so quickly and completely .. but I digress.

Initial "interfaces" with the Z-SYSTEM have shown a TREMENDOUS 
improvement over CP/M..most particularly in the areas of "friendliness" 
and functionality.  (It's MS/PC-DOS .. for those of us who don't much 
care for the EXPENSE of 16-bit computing.)

While I'd like to babble on & on about Z-SYSTEM - I can't..lest someone 
get the idea I'm enthusiatic about it..or (perish the thought) suspect 
I have an equity interest in the distributor.  (Wish I did.)

But to demonstrate my serious intent - I am preparing a comprehensive 
DOC file for installation of Z-SYSTEM on a KAYPRO 4-84 (for my own 
records) and will be more than happy to post it here should anyone 
express even the slightest interest.  It's not a breeze by any means 
but, when all is said & done, it is well worth the effort.  To 
paraphrase a once obscure music critic named Jon Landau who several 
years ago sat through a Bruce Springsteen performance at a small Boston 
club.. "I have seen the future of 8-bit computing.. and its name is
Z-SYSTEM."

Is there any HARDWARE installation required with ZRDOS or is it 
strictly software?  There must be alot of disk space required just for 
the system files - do you really feel the advantages of the system 
outweigh the disk space required?  I can see it on a hard disk system, 
but am less convinced with floppies.

You're right.  ZSYSTEM is a MUCH more noticeable boon on hard disks 
than floppies.  But there are considerable advantages on the smaller 
drives too.

As for file space..I've enjoyed a GAIN using ZSYSTEM.  First of all, 
ZRDOS is a direct BDOS replacement and takes up no more space than a 
machine's stock BDOS (even though it contains several significant BDOS 
enhancements.

Using ZCPR3, I no longer keep PIP or STAT on most disks, saving 14k 
right there.  Z3, as you know, has CPY and PROT to do most of the 
things PIP & STAT do.  The REQUIRED Z3 files that every disk should 
have are ENV (the environment), LDR (to load the environment..and other 
things) and RCP (the Resident Command Package.) They are 4k, 2k and 2k 
respectively.  So you see -by removing PIP & STAT (14k) I've freed-up 
8k of space per disk since the ZCPR3 residents total only 8k.

No hardware changes of any kind are required.  ZSYSTEM is strictly an 
operating system change...but as I mentioned to Charlie, I've just now 
gotten it running and will be reporting back periodically as advantages 
and disadvantages are observed.  I must say, though, that throughout 
the installation process, it became clear to me that ZSYSTEM is an 
intriguing and damn clever implementation.

Sb: A Z-SYSTEM Testimonial
Fm: Peter O.E. Bekker 74106,1430
To: Sysop Charlie Strom 76703,602 (X)

The ZRDOS advantages that come immediately to mind are the extended 
function calls you'd heard about.  These include calls to set and reset 
a warm boot trap - a call to GET the current DMA.....ZRDOS also 
supports file archiving and wheel protection...You even get a DELETE 
key that works for command line editing since ZRDOS eliminates the 
troublesome ^R function.

The BIG convenience, of course, is AUTO DISK LOGGING (just like MS-DOS)
no more repetative ^C's each time a disk is changed..just take one out, 
put another one in .. and go.  The error messages are a lot friendlier 
(and more informative) too.

ZRDOS directly answers the complaints of those who say CP/M is too 
"unfriendly" to gain wider accpetance.  And for programmers, it's a 
dream come true..particularly teamed with ZCPR3.

Haven't benchmarked..not really set up for it.  ZRDOS is written in Z80 
so it's got to be a little faster that CP/M..though because of disk 
access slowdowns, probably not noticeably so.  But I guess a Ramdisk 
check could be made.

As for the vast CP/M 80 domain of programs..no reason why they can't be 
run under ZRDOS...

But I've just now gotten this running and I'll report periodically to 
the membership on what I find.

Since ZRDOS is primarily a straight BDOS replacement, I will be 
concentrating [on writing] mostly (and in excruciating detail) on the 
installation of ZCPR3 in the K4-84. Included will be memory locations, 
sizes and uses...cold start patches for the BIOS, a change to lower the 
BDOS, a warm start patch to protect the CPR, step-by-step instruction 
on intstalling ZCPR3's main functions (ie External Path, Wheel Byte, 
Multiple Command Buffer.....in short, all the info I've been UNABLE to 
locate in the many ZCPR3 DOCs I've read.)

I hope to list all this info in such a way that even a total dolt such 
as myself would be able to make sense of it and even get Z-SYSTEM 
running while reading it.

   B3AC-2.INS, the insert file in the BYE3 directory at Simtel20, is the most
current insert for the Apple-Cat ][ modem for use with BYE3.  It contains the
following lines among the code:

;	This routine will not function due to changes made in Bye335.
;	However, it is being kept with the library, because a version
;	of BYE will soon appear that will allow this overlay to work.

   Could someone tell me when this version of BYE will be available, if it
isn't available already?  If it is, where is it located?  It's been about
a year since I posted numerous requests to get an Apple-Cat ][ overlay for
any existing BYE program, but I have yet to come across one that works.  The
Cat is probably one of the most popular Apple modems around, so I figure it
should not be all that hard to write an overlay for it.  Will such an overlay
ever be available?  I'd appreciate any information on this -- please send
replies directly;  I am not on the info-cpm list.  Thanks.

DEAR DAVID,

SPACERAD IS ESSENTIALY AN EXPERIMENT ABOARD THE CRRES (COMBINED RADIATION
RESEARCH & EXPERIMENTS SATTELITE) TO BE LAUNCHED NEXT YEAR. IT'S FIVE
YEAR MISSION IS TO BOLDLY GO WHERE NO RESEARCH IN SPACE RADIATION HAS
GONE BEFORE! SPECIFICALLY, SPACERAD WILL CONDUCT TESTS ON A VARIETY OF
SEMICONDUCTOR DEVICES AS TO THEIR CAPABILITY TO WITHSTAND VARIOUS RADIA-
TION ENVIRONMENTS IN OUTER SPACE. CONCURRENT GROUND TESTING WILL BE USED
TO VERIFY THAT OUR PRESENT METHODS OF GROUND TESTING AND MEASUREMENTS
HAVE BEEN AND WILL BE CORRECT FOR PREDICTING THE RESPONSE OF DEVICES IN
THE SPACE RADIATION ENVIRONMENT. SPACERAD HAS ITS OWN DATABASE AT JPL.
MY ACOOUNT IS THROUGH THEIR AUSPICES.

THE RADATA BANK IS A INDEPENDENT OFFSHOOT FROM SPACERAD, FUNDED BY NASA
TO HOUSE ALL PREVIOUS AND FUTURE RAD DATA COMPILED BY JPL AND/OR ANY 
OTHER SOURCES WHICH MAY WANT TO CONTRIBUTE TO SAME. THIS DATA BANK AS
OPPOSED TO THE SPACERAD BANK, WIL BE OPEN TO ACCESS TO ANYONE. IT WILL
HOUSE BOTH TOTAL DOSE AS WELL AS SINGLE EVENT UPSET RADIATION DATA FOR
SEMICONDUCTORS. 

THE RADATA BANK MAY NOW BE ALSO ACCESSED VIA TELNET (NOT TELENET) AS
RADATA@JPL-MILVAX.

THE REASON I SENT IT TO THE INFO-CPM NET WAS DUE TO ITS WIDE BASE OF
READERS OF MANY INTERESTS. I ALSO SENT THE MESSAGE TO SPACE DIGEST
AND A NUMBER OF OTHER NETS.

                    THANKS FOR POSTING,

Is this m-code the same 'standard' m-code that will run on other machines?
For example, can I take the m-code produced by the Borland compiler and
run it on an IBM machine or an Apple?  (or even the Lilith machine?)

For advertisers wanting to reach a good hunk of the CP/M marketplace,
try FOGHORN the dynamite monthly newsletter of the FIRST OSBORNE 
GROUP (now expanded to serve all CP/M owners):  P.O. Box 3474/
Daly City, CA/94015-0474.  Advertising rates vary, but I think 
you'll find their CPM (the other one, advertising COST PER THOUSAND 
(M)) to be much more attractive than thhose of the glossy magazines.

This is a brief summary of responses I received to my original
posting of ~3 weeks ago, regarding where I could find the location of
the DMA address on a CP/M-80 system.

The answer, as I could have found out myself if I'd looked a little
deeper, is in the BIOS. It seems to be a simple matter, if you have
the source, to add a GETDMA call to the BIOS jump table or to
intercept SETDMA calls to the BDOS if you don't.

Thanks in particular to Keith Petersen for his extensive help.
Also to Rick Conn for pointing out (to my unsuspecting horror)
the nonreentrant nature of the vanilla BDOS and to Bomberger (of
Poor Person Software) for his unselfish assistance.
And, of course, to all the others who mailed me.

The real-time clock hardware goes in this week (D.V.).

The ratio of e-mailed responses to postings was exemplary. This seems
to be one newsgroup that knows how to do it right.

Apparently, it was a computer made around 1981. It runs CPM2.2 and is an

I have seen some ads lately about ZBASIC from Zedcor Inc, 4500 East Speedway,
Suite 93, Tucson, Arizona 85712 (800-482-4567 or 602-795-3996).  Versions are
supposedly available for 6502 native Apple IIs, CP/M, IBM, etc.  Claims made
by the ad are, i.a., "structured basic", 6 to 54 digits of precision
(selectable by the user), built in editor, and "faster than just about
anything" [except maybe a Cray].

Does anyone have any knowledge of this company or experience with the
product?

I have some Applesoft programs which I need to speed up.

Thanx in advance,

I am  interested  in  hearing  your  experiences  with  Commodore-64 CP/M. I
recently  purchased  an  SX-64  (a portable also know as the "Executive 64",
manufactured  by  Commodore  and  discontinued). I of course wanted the CP/M
option, which was difficult to scrounge up at this late date.  But I won.

Anyway, I  seemed  to  have  heat  problems with the cartridge, and after an
afternoon with a can of chip freeze, I isolated one errant chip and replaced
it.

Now it  seems  to  cruze  along  okay,  but  after 20 or 30 minutes of work,
sometimes more, it dies right as I do a disk I/O. So I wasted another can of
chip  freeze  to  no  avail,  and  now I'm wondering if the SX-64 maybe just
doesn't have as much power available as a real '64.

Can somebody  vouch  for  CBM-64  CP/M  ?  How about on an SX-64 ? Thanks in
advance.

There is a utility program which is part of the TURBO POWER
TOOLS which does exactly what you want.  I can't seem to find
the source code anywhere, but if I do, I will be glad to tell
you exactly how it is done.  
If my memory does not fail me, you might want to try this
command, which I suspect might also work:

    PIP  ascii.fil = wordstar.fil [Z]

The Z option masks out the most significant bit from the
source file.  I believe that WS uses that bit for it's
internal use.  Let me know if this works.

There are two files that you want, both found on simtel20 in the
pd:<cpm.txtutl> directory.  They are ensoft.com and unsoft1c.lbr.

unsoft will remove soft spaces, end-of-lines, hyphens, etc. and convert
or lose dot commands.  Much more powerful than using pip to strip off
high order bits.

ensoft will take a plain text file and put the soft spaces and line feeds
back in.  Also useful.  I use both all the time.

You might also look at the fil*.* files in the same directory.  They are the
Irv Hoff filter commands which do much the same.

These are cp/m 80 .com files and thus will work on the 8 side of your 816.

   I have managed to install the ZCPR3 operating system on my Apple II+,
but it's the 56k version.  What I need is 60k CP/M 2.23 under ZCPR3 in order
for it to work with the hard drive (it accepts only 60k 2.23).  Does anyone
have ZCPR3 on a 60k CP/M 2.23 floppy disk?  If so, I can easily copy its
CP/M image to the hard drive, and I should be all set;  please reply if you
have this.  (I have tried, unsuccessfully, to use a BIOS patch called
Z3AP60.ASM, which is supposed to do just what I want;  upon cold boot, the
drive keeps tring to access part of the disk over and over again, but
that's about it).

I don't know the answer to your question, but at least one place to
look is the Good Neighbor Help roster in newsletter 307 (which I just 
posted).  It gives at least one Apple person.

PS There is also your local Z-Node to which such questions can be posted.

Subject: NULU11 bugs (again)

The following is relayed from CompuServe's CP-MIG:

#: 152927 S1/General
    07-Nov-85  17:19:21
Sb: #NULU Bug
Fm: Charles Hart 72755,500
To: All

So you thought the reported bug in NULU v1.1 (or v1.2) was so obscure
it could never happen to you, boobie?  Check out the comprehensive
directory listing below and see if you can spot at first glance what
NULU did when I extracted a file just a _little_ but larger than the
buffer to another drive.

The first clue I had was that the directory program reported 189k
used of 191k and 5k free. (The listing below is only a partial due to
space restrictions.)  Something didn't add up.  So, I tried adding up
the individual file sizes - 189k was correct, 5k free was _not_.

I then did the following:

 B0>Z A:CP4KER.* [C

=============================================================================
 2 Files, occupying 53k of 191k total capacity
 23 directory entries and 5k bytes remain on a:

No question about it, the third extent (or whatever they call it) for
CP4KER.DQC is really messed up.  Never saw anything like that before,
and NULU will do it all day long.  Tried it on two 40k+ files and
ended up being told I had a 220k disk - when all you can pack on this
KPII is 191k max!

My extractions and unsqueezations were done from my HD first to a
floppy and then to the ramdisk.

SYSOP SirCharles has mentioned from time to time that there was a bug
in NULU - he's correct, and I suggest that all output from NULU be
inspected very closely before use.  Or use LU310 instead.  After all,
where there is one bug, there may be more....

Fm: Mike Allen 74146,2717

I'm getting into the middle of this thread, but it sounds like you
guys are discussing the same problem I've seen with NULU11 on a Zenith
Z-89 using 3 floppies and 2 5-mb hard-drives with ZCPR3.  I find that
when I try to extract or unsqueeze a file other than to the drive/user
that the LBR file exists on AND the extracted file requires more than one
extent, I get a bad extracted file.  Who's got the fix?

#: 152973 S1/General
    08-Nov-85  07:50:45
Sb: #152956-#NULU Bug
Fm: Charles Hart 72755,500
To: <MoM> John Deakin 74015,1624 (X)

John, do the following to see the problem:

1) Make a LBR file with at least one file greater that your buffer
size as shown by NULU when you sign on - for most computers with 64k a
file of 55k will be enough.  It doesn't matter if the file is squeezed
or not, I just happened to be working with that type of file.

2) Put the LBR file on drive A:

3) Enter Nulu and extract the file to drive B:, any user area. You
will see the problem I outlined.

The problem is extraction to another drive, not another user area on
the same drive or the same user area on the same drive.  This is why
it took so long for me to know I was hit by the bug.  I have had
strange things happen to my large files before, but decided
(incorrectly, it seems) that operator error was involved.  It was,
just not the type I thought...

Further review indicates that the extent involved seems to be the
third one (numbered 02H) only, the sector reuse stops in the 4th one.


#: 152992 S1/General
    08-Nov-85  20:02:15
Sb: #152982-#NULU Bug
Fm: Charles Hart 72755,500
To: <MoM> John Deakin 74015,1624 (X)

John, the bug must be related to the allocation size - on your K10 the
smallest file size is 4k, right?  Try the test with a file of 4 x 68k
and see if it works.

All of my errors were on writes to a 191k, 1k alllocation floppy.
Yes, I have made all the patches to NULU - at least the v1.2 I'm using
said in the LBR file the FIX patch had been made. One more thing:  Be
sure to be logged on the drive you are extracting to with the -u
command.  It may be that the change in allocation size between the two
I was using is a factor - the HD has 8k allocations and the floppy has
1k.

Interesting, no?

Re:   DU-V89 problems

I have 2 version of DU, 7.7 and 8.9.  When I use 7.7 to look at the
system tracks of a dd 8" disk all seems to be ok.  But if I use 8.9
all of the sectors on track 0 look the same and all the sectors of
track 1 look alike.  Once I get to the directory area, all look ok.
8.9 does the same thing on sd or dd 5.25"(soft sec) on a Heath H8.

Can anyone tell me whats going on??

The MIX C tale goes on....

I called MIX today and advised them of the problems that I have
encountered with their product:

 1) Source Line Length limited to 80 columns.
    Reply:  Will be expanded to 240+ in next revision.

 2) Linker Error Building Command file if not in user area 0 and
requesting a stand alone COM file.
    Reply:  Will be corrected in next revision.

 3) Register variables declared for function arguments cause an error.
    Reply:  Will be corrected in next revision.

 4) Program can not compile truly large #define groups - exceeds
stack/heap space.
    Reply:  True.  Discussed possibility of continuing the cc -> c
progression to its' logical conclusion (program would be overlay
manager only with no code to get maximum program area) and was told
would make program 'very slow'. I said 'so what - you don't think
you've got a speed daemon _now_, do you?'. Listener put good face on
it, but was clearly not happy to have product compared with Turbo
Pascal.  Not sure I won many points here, so those lurkers out there
who would really like a 'verrry slow' $39.95 compiler which will
compile those large programs we all write should call (214) 783-6001
and tell them about your desires.  (Just the ones related to 'C'
compilers, now...)  It would help if you own the product (or order it
in the same call) and you probably should not mention my name...

I've been researching this subject for about a year now and there at
least two drives on the market and several others announced but not
yet delivering.  There is a 10Mbyte half-height (formatted 14.1M
unformatted) drive from Xebec that runs the SASI subset of SCSI, not
particularily interesting in my mind nor did they admit to working on
a higher capacity unit when I talked to them at NCC this year.

CDC has a full-height 86Mbyte unformatted drive avail. now that also
runs SASI.  The drive has an average seek time of 39ms max. and a full
stroke seek time of 89ms max.

Quantum has a line of drives of half-height 50 and 80Mbyte formatted
capacities that run the full SCSI set of commands, at about $950 1000x
for the 80Mbyte unit. Unfortunately, the release date for evaluation
units has been set back from Oct 85 to Feb 86.  Apparently because of
problems with integrating the hardware and software.

Rodime PLC has a 3 1/2" 10 or 20Mbyte drives with an avg access time
of 85ms and running SCSI commands.  The product description in Jun
85's Computer Design mag. indicates that evaluation units were avail
then with production to start 3rd qtr.

Applied Information Memories announced a 250Mb full height drive at
NCC with a SCSI interface and 18ms (! wow) average postioning time.  I
have no other information other than a contact - Boris Zbicki, 776
Sycamore Dr., Milpitas, Ca. (408) 263-9321.

I also understand that there are a number of Japanese companies
working on SCSI drives, but I am not aware of any releases from them
at this time.  Please keep me informed of any additional information
you may receive from the net.  If you need more data, addresses, etc.,
please write me.

Hi,

  I recently downloaded CHALK.LBR, an electronic spreadsheet program.
I used LSWEEP.COM to extract the files, but could not find any .COM
file in there to execute. There are a couple of .CTL and .OBJ files,
but that's it. Is there anyone out there in netland that is familiar
with this public domain program that can help me out. I am running

Paul,

This is just a guess .. but sometimes files moved from certain RBBSs
and RCPMs have their .COM file names changed to .OBJ (to keep bozos
from running programs on the RCPM host).

If you use DDT and look at the .OBJ files, you may find they kinda look
like real .COM files (you know, saving stack pointer at the beginning,
likely looking assembler instructions, etc.).  Then you might just take
a chance on renaming one to .COM and running it (with all valuable floppies
out of the system and watching for any hard disk access like a hawk, just
in case it's an Arf Arf).

This is untested but ...

    I believe that WordStar can generate ``straight ASCII'' by
    itself. I am not in a position to test this, but as I recall,
    WordStar can ``print'' a file to another file. The resulting
    file may very well be what you're looking for.

Message-ID: <[MIT-MC.ARPA].714936.851111.STORK>

This is an inquiry to the net about the possibility
of a BUG in FINDBAD60.

Had a disk go bad today.
Manipulation with DU2 confirmed two bad
sectors, in different groups.

Ran the disk through BADLIM, a commercial program
that finds and protect BAD SECTORS (by assigning the
group to a BSBSBSBS.BSB file). BADLIM did its
job nicely.

Then tried same thing with FINDBAD60 - to my surprise,
FINDBAD60 declared the disk to be just fine!

On earlier versions of FINDBAD, I had noted that
FINDBAD does not find all bad sectors that DU2
will hang up on, or that BADLIM will find and protect.

Anyone know about this? Anyone interested in tracking down
why FINDBAD apparently doesn't do its job as well as
it should?  I'm interested in working on the project,
but need a little guidance from someone who knows
about how FINDBAD & DU2 do their READ's, and what
other ways there are to READ that might be more
demanding.

BYE339 is now available from SIMTEL20 as:

Filename			Type	 Bytes	 CRC

Directory PD:<CPM.BYE3>
BYE339.AQM.1			BINARY	 60032  C781H

This program allows modem callers to use a CP/M system just as if they
were seated at the system console.  Special assembly-time options al-
low limiting the caller's access by password and/or access to only a
message-service program.  A number of external inserts are available
to adapt this program to various computers, clocks and modems.  It may
be assembled with ASM, LASM, MAC or M80.  If the ZCPR3 equate is set
YES, a macro assembler such as MAC or M80 will be required.

There are spinoffs of the BYE program (notably MBYE and BYE5), the
author has tried to incorporate any "features" of these programs so
that users need not use a spinoff but instead use the real BYE
program.

Here are some of the latest updates:

  v339      Added my improved BIN2BCD and BCD2BIN routines.
  10/21/85  Added Mike DeWeese's call-back routines (note: to use call-back,
              you must have a Hayes compatible modem that can handle "ATA".)
            Printer was not working when going through BDOS calls.
            Now the MDRING stuff should work properly.
            Changed time routines so system only checks time-on after ever CR.
              (Will speed things up for slow clock users).
            Added "ULTIME" key to give a user "unlimited time" on the system.
            Modded RSX handler very slightly so multiple RSX's are trackable
              using CBF's RSX handling routines.
                                                        pst

  v338      Re-installed code for modems that require ring signals (such as
  08/08/85  PMMI, Hayes MM100 & MM][, AppleCat][), which was brutally removed
            by the author of Bye335.  Changed documentation which had some
            BYEBDOS calls backwards.  Changed format of two BYEBDOS calls.
            Bye was loading in ~256 bytes lower than necessary-- fixed it.
            Shortened stack space from 60 to 40 bytes.
            Added "ASKNULL" equate to disable asking for nulls.
            Added "MDMRNG"  equate for PMMI type modems that need ring/answer.
            Fixed bug introduced in v335 re: COM files on other drives.
            Fixed bug introduced in v337 re: NO25TH / lastcaller reading.
                                                        pst

  v337a     Added additional conditionals to take more assembly time
  07/27/85  advantage of HS300, HS1200, HS2400, B3IM & IMODEM.  Moved the
            end marker for the B3IM routine to just above IMHANG so to avoid
            the inadvertant deletion of some lines of code that belong with
            BYE instead of with the B3IM routines.  Included BYE337.FIX.

stop it from putting out the Dreaded Control X after each pause.  And why is it
putting out a Control X anyway.  Control X puts a WYSE terminal to sleep (why

I think the operative phrase is "Never Mind".  It seems that I got into the

 It was innocent.  Well it seems that CP/M 3 echos the character that you type.
 So by typing a CONTROL X it echoed CNTROL X and pumpkined my terminal. (by 
listening to football announcers I have learned that the Verbs built around 
DEFEND have all been worn out.  DEFENCE has been drafted as the new replacement
VERB and all the new verbs like defenced and defences are now being used.  I 
hope that this VERB wears out soon as well.  But anyway I thought I would 
introduce a verb a day and PUMPKINED is my first)

	I have been using ALIAS for over a year with no problems, at least
	until last week.  For no apparent reason it quit working properly.
	When invoking ALIAS to prepare a new command script it would seem
	to come up ok.  I would then type in the script and then ALIAS would
	seem to write out a command file.  When I invoked ALIAS a second time
	to check the script it comes back with the correct script. The problem
	comes when I try to invoke the command file.  Upon execution of the 
	command file the disk drive starts seeking (cycling??) back and forth
	and the screen moves up a blank line at time with each cycle.  The 
	system is completely locked up, there is no response to any key input.
	The only way to break out of this condition is thru a system reset
	and cold boot.  The ALIAS is version 1.1 and had been used earlier
	that week with no problems.  I am using a Z3-DOT-COM installed version
	of ZCPR3 on a 63K HEATH H89A.  DATESTAMPER occupies the 1K above the
	the system.  I have tried a reinstalled ALIAS from my master backups
	to no avail.

Now the use question:

	When using MENU in an ALIAS can it be followed by another command?
	For example:
		PATH; SETFILE; MENU; PATH
	When I tried this, the script executed as follows:
		PATH; SETFILE; PATH; MENU

I am just mild mannered end user, so any help, hints, and/or pointers would
be appreciated.

Thanks in advance,
David Sampar

Try changing the .OBJ files to .COM files, and try to execute them.
Some XMODEM programs won't send the .COM files, so, to trick it,
people will REName them from xxxx.COM to xxxx.OBJ.

I am looking for anyone with a manual or any documentation for an 8" disk

I found this bug also, and it seems serious.
The solution would be a filter that automatically does substitution
of the macro into a source text file. 

Has anybody got a filter that does string substitution on a file that runs
under cpm?

Recently, I bought an Eagle II cpm type thingy at a garage sale
for a modest stipend.  To prove that you get what you pay for,
this device had absolutely nothing with it:  No Disks (Especially
System Disks), No Manuals, No Nothing!

If anyone out there would be kind enough to dust off your old
Eagle and copy some disks, and/or xerox some manuals i think 
some sort of cash (CASH) renumeration could be arranged.

Let me know (phone or Email) before you send anything out.

Xerox is not a verb.

Because serious bugs have been reported, NULU15 has been removed from
SIMTEL20 and my RCP/M.  The messages below explain in detail by this
action is necessary.  NULU11 suffers from the same problems.  It is
recommended that all verions of NULU not be used.

NULU is one of those programs that's "free for the using" but no
source code has been provided.  It's a real shame because the program
has a lot of nice features and could have been fixed by someone with
the time to do it.  The author has apparently not been able to
duplicate the elusive bug, which apparntly can only be duplicated in
systems which have differing group size allocations on various drives.

Just grabbed NULU15 off Poppourri this morning, and tried it out on
the previously reported problem(s).

When creating a new LBR on a different DU, it now remains on the
default drive from which called, as it should.  One bug dead.

However, the most serious is still there.  When extracting a large
file (about 70K in this case) from a LBR on my hard disk with 4K
blocks, to my floppy with 2K blocks, it trashes the file, with no
warning.  Only way to check it is run a CRC check on the results.

Printing to disk expands the dot commands and makes basic line- and
page-end decisions, but leaves high bits on.  It doesn't get rid of
control characters (^S, ^B, etc.), either.

I don't know about the ^X, but when I implemented CP/M 3.0 "n years ago",
I just gave the O.S. a couple blocks, and cached the disks myself.  I'm
currently using 256K in a banked configuration (top 16K fixed, and 5 48K
banks) "soon" to be 1MB w/21 banks w/RAMDISK as well.  Actually I like
3.0 a lot better than 2.2.  At very least my files have timestamps, and
I've implemented a "make" facility which I like quite a lot.

OK daft question time - is the update only for specific machines or is someone
willing to post/mail a CP/M 3 BIOS skeleton that I can massage for my machine.

I recently acquired a brand new Shugart Type SA-901 eight-inch disk
drive.  My present Xerox 820-based packet radio bulletin board and
message server runs two Shugart SA-800s.  According to the SA-800
manual, the SA-901 will also be applicable to expand the PBBS storage
cap- acity.  My problem is I have no data providing the cardedge
signals for the SA-901.  Does anyone have the required pinout
information?  I'd be more than happy to photocopy same and return the
material, pay postage, etc.  OR, a simple listing would be sufficient!
Am also looking for power supply requirements (specs).  many thanks to
whomever can supply this much needed info.  Running out of disk space!

Recent SD History:

11/15/85  This is a major update (skipped to v110) and incorporates
  v110    changes requested by several Sysops.  Installation of this
          program was becoming a nightmare, even for experienced RCP/M
          operators.  Many confusing and redundant equates have been
          eliminated.  The installer no longer need be concerned about
          running BYE low or high, or where his BDOS page starts.  The
          need to install computer dependent code has been eliminated.
          Previous versions could be assembled with combinations of
          equates that could result in assembler errors, or worse,
          crash the system.  A new option ($O) has been added to dis-
          play ONLY system (.SYS) files.  Simplicity and security were
          the results.

The Epson PX-8 Geneva is a lap-top CPM computer that tallies in under 5
pounds.  I have owned one since this past May, and still greatly enjoy using
it.

I have found myself wanting to ask other Geneva owners about technical and
usage information.  The common means of user support (magazines, users
groups, and Epson) seem to be a bit lacking for the tiny Geneva.
Therefore, I'm sending this around to see what interest there might
be in a Geneva mailing-list group.

The topics I'm interested in discussing include: use of the bar code
and a/d input ports; expansion of the system via the bus (normally used by
the multi-function unit); exchange and reviews of software specifically
designed for the PX-8; general hints, kinks and support.

So, if you're a Geneva owner, please send me a message if you would be
interested in taking part in this mailing list.  Include when you purchased
the Geneva, what peripherals and accessories you have, and what you
primarily use it for.

Replies can be send to:

   Thanks for the information on the BYE overlay.  I have been hacking at
the MBYE overlay (MBACAT-2.INS) and have found that there is a "ANSW" label
that is also used as an equate.  As far as I know, this isn't allowed -- maybe
I'm wrong, but the overlay seems to work fine at 300 now that I have changed
all occurences of the ANSW label and its related ANSWs to "ANSWR", and have
left the ANSW equate alone (or the other way around, not sure).  In any case,
it works at 300, but at 1200, the program works fine from the local console,
but the remote user gets nothing.  I am halfway there.  Any more suggestions
for the 1200 fix would be greatly appreciated.  I will contribute the working
overlay to whichever BYE series it works with as soon as I have it fixed, but I
think I'll need a little help with the 1200 part.  300 is fixed though.

I have an ALS Z-80B card with CP/M 3.01C.  I also have a
Thunderclock.  I haven't figured out yet how to read the clock
card from CP/M.  Seem like you must have to have a routine running
in the 6502 to put the clock time in the Apple memory.  I don't
believe you can read the clock card directly from the CP/M card.
From what I understand only one slot in the Apple can be active at
one time.

Anyone have any suggestions or know of software available to do that
metioned above?  I hate typing in the time every time I boot up the
system when there is a clock available.

I spoke to the NULU author (Martin Murray) on the phone last night.  He
sais tha{_t he has been made aware of the problem with drives with 
differing allocation sizes, and that he will get right on it.  I will
send him a summary of the current net traffic, and will continue to do so. 
If anyone wishes to report additional problems, please message me

Subject: SB-180 query
To: info-cpm@AMSAA.ARPA

I just received an SB-180 board from MicroMint, and discovered a
rather discomforting feature about it.  I CANNOT BOOT FROM SINGLE-SIDED
DISKS IN THE NATIVE FORMAT MODE.  The touted compatibility with the
Ampro little board does not extend to single-sided, 80-track formats.

   Before I tread once again on previously trodden ground and re-invent
the wheel, has anyone modified the BIOS, NBOOT, and whatever else to
make the SB-180 work with single-sided 80-track disks?  I have a couple
of Shugart SA-300 3.5" drives that I wanted to use to make the system a
laptop portable, and with the double-sided boot requirement, that is out
of the question.

   Other than the above, the board came up with no problems, and I was
able to read the supplied disks on my Ampro in DSDD, 40-track format.

   Thanks in advance.  Please respond directly to avoid cluttering the
net.

Subject:  "For sale" and "product announcement" postings:

Fellow CP/Mers - Occasional postings of messages offering or announcing items
for sale have caused some flurries of (sometimes) heated debate concerning
"proper use" of the Defense Data Network, through which INFO-CPM is distrib-
uted.  I believe that most subscribers to this list honestly wish to adhere
to the "network rules" and not jeopardize INFO-CPM's use of the DDN.  But
although the policy regarding personal "for sale" messages has been clearly
stated many times (they're not allowed), it has become quite obvious that the
lack of a clearly stated policy concerning new product announcements is causing
much frustration to those who wish to post such information while still
"playing by the rules".  Therefore, this message states my interpretation of
the regulations, and presents a resulting policy to which I, as INFO-CPM list
maintainer, ask all DDN subscribers to adhere.  I also ask that contributors
to "NET.MICRO.CPM" on USENET voluntarily cooperate so that the mutually bene-
ficial news gateway between INFO-CPM and NET.MICRO.CPM is not threatened.

     The June 1984 issue of the "DDN Directory" gives on page 12 the following
statement concerning use of the network:

	"The DDN is an operational DoD network and is not intended
	to compete with comparable commercial service.  It is intended
	to be used solely for the conduct of or in support of official
	U.S. Government business."

It is the vagueness of the term "official U.S. Government business" that forces
a local interpretation to be made, and that is the reason for this message.

     Briefly stated, my policy is this:

	1. I offer to act as a clearinghouse for all new product announcements
	   posted by persons having remunerative interests in the products.
	   Persons wishing to post such announcements are asked to send them to
	   INFO-CPM-REQUEST@AMSAA.ARPA for forwarding to the list.  Please note
	   that this applies ONLY to "remunerative interest postings".  Readers
	   having no such interests are always welcome to send comments about
	   products, new or old, directly to INFO-CPM.

	2. Messages offering personal items for sale must not be posted.

This policy is explained in more detail below.


     PRODUCT ANNOUNCEMENTS:  I feel that the information value of a product
announcement must be weighed against possible personal rewards when making a
decision about use of the network.  There are many government-owned computers
running CP/M, and on which serious government work is being done.  Several
years ago, the DARCOM Microcomputer Software Support System (DMSSS) project
was instituted, with one of its aspects to provide a repository of public
domain software on the net.  INFO-CPM was sponsored as the official vehicle
for announcements of the status of the collections, and to promote the inter-
change of user information on the use of CP/M and the programs which run under
it.  This is why INFO-CPM is "in support of official U.S. Government business".
New products that provide improvements to the CP/M operating system, to
associated utility programs or to the machines on which these programs run
offer productivity increases to government users.  Therefore, it is in the
government interest to distribute factual information concerning such products.
Still, when an individual having a personal monetary interest in a product
posts an announcement concerning that product, it raises questions about
"commercial use of the network".

     Therefore, as I have no involvement with any provider of CP/M-related
products or services, I offer to act as a "clearinghouse" for all new product
announcements being submitted by persons having remunerative interests in
these products.  I ask that all individuals wishing to post such announcements
via INFO-CPM send them to INFO-CPM-REQUEST@AMSAA.ARPA.  My requirements for
relaying such messages to the list are:

	1. They must be of general interest to the "CP/M community".  Products
	   that address specific subsets of this community, such as those
	   which operate with or on an "XYZ machine running CP/M 2.2" meet
	   this requirement.

	2. They must be brief and factual, listing the salient features of
	   the products, and giving brief explanations of the techniques used
	   to achieve improved performance (if applicable).  In short, they
	   must be INFORMATIVE.

	3. They must be free of advertising hype - no superlatives.  Compar-
	   ative words such as "better" and "improved" are OK provided brief
	   explanations are given as stated above.

	4. They should include the name and netmail address of a person to whom
	   requests for additional informaton can be directed, or a statement
	   that no additional information is available if that is the case.

I will not attempt to present here an all-inclusive, "iron-clad" set of rules,
as I do not believe it can be done; and if it can, I don't know how.  Please
send any questions regarding this matter to INFO-CPM-REQUEST@AMSAA.ARPA, and
NOT to the entire list.  If further clarifications seem necessary, I will
update and resend this message.

     PERSONAL "FOR SALE" MESSAGES:  I think there is a very significant
difference between product announcements and personal "for sale" messages.
Products that are offered to the public which provide new capabilities, or
which improve the performance of existing systems offer these same benefits to
government users.  But personal deals are "one-on-one", and unless the buyer is
a government user (which I consider an extremely remote possibility considering
the "red-tape" associated with procurement), no benefit can accrue to the
government.  Therefore, personal small-volume offerings violate the intent
of the rules and should not be posted.

     REPLIES TO POSTINGS:  Please make intelligent decisions regarding replies
to product announcements.  If such a reply is of general interest, then feel
free to send it to INFO-CPM@AMSAA.ARPA (i.e., to the entire list).  I will
include with each posting the address of a person to contact for additional
information (or a statement that no further information is available, if that
is the case).  Please send non-general-interest replies PRIVATELY to the person
listed, and NOT to the entire list.

     If a personal "for sale" message does appear in INFO-CPM and you wish to
respond to it, please do so PRIVATELY and not to the entire list.  If your
mailer can't send private replies, then DO NOT REPLY at all.


     I would like to thank Jeff Edelheit, Frank Wancho, Bridger Mitchell and
Jim Guyton, as well as several local BRL people who do not read INFO-CPM for
their participation in a "behind-the-scenes" discussion of this subject.  We
had a spirited but fruitful argument that helped greatly in clarifying the
issues and in arriving at the above policy, which I believe is responsible and
responsive to the rules for network use.

     The above policy has been coordinated with the Army Ballistic Research
Laboratory personnel responsible for monitoring BRL's network access, through
which INFO-CPM is delivered to the DDN.  This message will be repeated period-
ically for the information of new readers, and to refresh the memories of
others.  Your cooperation will help to insure the continued existence of the
INFO-CPM newsgroup.

Replace this line with your compiler bug

I sat down to write the program for the next project I am going
to give to my Computer Science I class at home on my CPM system
with Turbo Pascal Version 3.00.  The following program illustrates
the problem with the program I wrote:

program junk(input,output);
procedure proca(chita:char); forward;
procedure procb(chitb:char);
begin
     writeln('Entering procb with a ',chitb);
     proca('A');
     writeln('Leaving procb with a ',chitb);
end;
procedure proca;
begin
     writeln('Entering proca with a ',chita);
     if chita = 'I' then procb('I');
     writeln('Leaving proca with a ',chita);
end;
begin
     proca('I');
end.

The output using Turbo Pascal was:

     Entering proca with a I
     Entering procb with a I
     Entering proca with a A
     Leaving proca with a A
     Leaving procb with a I
     Leaving proca with a A

While the output for the same program on a VAX with BSD UNIX,
IBM VM/SP CMS, or a Macintosh with MacPascal was:

     Entering proca with a I
     Entering procb with a I
     Entering proca with a A
     Leaving proca with a A
     Leaving procb with a I
     Leaving proca with a I

as I expected.  Calling Borland Technical Support was no help,
as they wanted a copy of the program on an IBM format disk.
The technical support specialist asked me to send a copy of the
program on a disk.  When I asked "in what format?" she replied
"IBM, of course."  I guess CPM does not exist anymore.

Obviously, I was quite surprised at the output, and now I
wonder how they tested the compiler.  It seems that a program
as simple as the one above should have been tested.

It is possible that when the technical support person for Borland
answered your question the format referred to was the IBM format of
sector information that underlies the CPM operating system format on CPM
disks. In other words sectors are formatted in IBM format. The content
and length of the sectors are defined by CPM.

You have written a program with recursive calls.  Turbo Pascal for CP/M does
not generate recursive code in its default mode.  You will get the expected
result by including the compiler directive {$A-}.  This information is in the
manual.

Hi, David,

	Re your question, MENU operated like it was supposed to.
For command sequences like

		commands; MENU; commands

MENU will function to install itself (at the point in which it is called),
and then the commands following MENU will execute.  After all commands in
the line complete, then the MENU actually runs.

	This is a general truth for all shells.  See the chapter on Shell
programming and MENU/VMENU in "ZCPR3: The Manual".

	The rationale for this is that MENU is a shell, processing commands
which are then handed off to the ZCPR3 CP via the Multiple Command Line
Buffer.  This is the same buffer the original command line (which contained
the MENU command) was in.  MENU can create simple or multiple command
sequences, so there is no way to distinguish between a command generated
by MENU and one part of the command line which invoked MENU.

	Re your problem with ALIAS, since ALIAS builds command lines,
it is hard to say exactly what the problem is without more detail and study.

Stanley, the problem is that you're not using Turbo's 'Absolute Code'
directive {$A+-}.  It's default is absolute code {$A+}. Since your
test program is recursive (proca calls procb calls proca), you'll have
to disable absolute code to allow recursive calls {$A-}.  Recursion in
CP/M executes slower and takes up more memory.  The correction outputs
as expected.

program junk;
{$A- recursion}
   procedure proca(chita:char); forward;
   procedure procb(chitb:char);
      begin
         writeln('Entering procb with a ',chitb);
         proca('A');
         writeln('Leaving procb with a ',chitb);
      end;
   procedure proca;
      begin
         writeln('Entering proca with a ',chita);
         if chita = 'I' then procb('I');
         writeln('Leaving proca with a ',chita);
      end;
{$A+ absolute}
begin
   proca('I');
end.

Outputs...

Entering proca with a I
Entering procb with a I
Entering proca with a A
Leaving proca with a A
Leaving procb with a I
Leaving proca with a I

Now available from SIMTEL20:

Filename			Type	 Bytes	 CRC

Directory PD:<CPM.FILCPY>
FIP.LBR.1			BINARY	 51584  C629H

The following is an excerpt from the DOC file:

FIP version 1.0 runs on a Z80 processor under the Digital Research
CP/M 2.2 Operating System.  FIP version 1.0 is designed for an 80
column console device and at least one disk drive.  While programming
considerations were made for CP/M 2.x, there may be User Number
limitations for versions earlier than 2.2 .

FIP is a user oriented disk file handler designed for both the CP/M
beginner and the system expert.  FIP allows the beginning CP/M user to
copy and examine files and to examine directories easily without
having to memorize operations.  FIP gives the system expert the
capability to perform high speed batch file transfers automatically
and to completely examine disk directories.  FIP prompts for all
user responses, always shows you what user# and what drives will be
accessed, supplies the user response defaults (which are invoked by
typing <cr> to prompts), and has built in safety feature -no action on
files will ever take place by responding to any prompt with a <cr>.

Some of FIP's features:

*    allows file transfers across user# boundaries.
*    designed  to  make  backups of hard  disks  or  other  large 
     storage  devices  using smaller storage devices automatic  -
     (will  transfer specified files to 'backup' floppy until  it 
     is full -then will prompt user to insert next backup floppy, 
     etc.).
*    provides detailed disk(s) characteristic summaries.
*    provides  a detailed disk file summary of any file(s) on any 
     or all user#'s and the remaining free storage.
*    allows any two files on system to be compared and optionally 
     shows differences in hexadecimal-ascii format with location.
*    allows any file to be inspected in either  hexadecimal-ascii 
     format or ascii format.
*    accepts wildcard characters in all filenames. 
*    allows changing file attributes on a prompted 'file-by-file' 
     nature or any specified set of files automatically.
*    allows printer logging of all file operations.
*    allows deleted directory entries to be displayed.
*    maximizes the available memory space by dynamically dividing 
     all  of the available memory between directory  entries  and 
     file buffer areas thereby enabling high speed file transfers 
     and compares.
*    FIP  is written in very optimized Z80 code allowing  highest 
     operating speed and only requires 8 Kbytes storage.
*    allows wildcard inputs on file renaming -saving you time.
*    file transfer operations allow:
     -    confirmation  prompts  any time a file transfer  would 
          overwrite   an   existing  file   and   then   allowing 
          abort, skip, and renaming options.
     -    bulk file transfers, with or without prompting, with or 
          without verification.
     -    always  shows  the  amount of space  each  source  file 
          requires  (using  destination disk blocksize)  and  the 
          amount of free space remaining on destination disk.
     -    allows  changing  destination floppy at any time  (even 
          during bulk file transfers).
     -    allows  changing  destination drive at any  time  (even 
          during bulk file transfers).
     -    allows  filename to be changed for destination copy  at 
          any time.

   I don't know about Release 3.00, but in Release 2.00 of Turbo Pascal
running under CP/M-80, you must compile recursive procedures and functions
with the {$A-} option for them to work.  Putting a {$A-} line before
the line 'procedure proca(chita:char); forward;' will probably fix this 
problem.

Subject: SD111 latest Super Directory program now available

Thanks to Dick Mead <MEAD@USC-ECLB>, the latest version of SD, the
Super Directory program, is now available from SIMTEL20 as:

Filename			Type	 Bytes	 CRC

Directory PD:<CPM.DIRUTL>
SD111.LBR.1			BINARY	 71680  7D43H

Recent update history:

11/20/85  Minor hack to re-install a reverse video capability for
  v111    displaying attribute tags. USELC is limited to alpha A-Z
          so REVID will let you see other characters that have been
          tagged. Up to 7 bytes each for enter and exit sequences
          are available. They can be patched via DDT, DU, etc., or
          if left all 0, will be ignored. You can set USELC too, if
          inverse lower case excites you.
                               Dick Mead, Pasadena ZNODE 36

11/15/85  This is a major update (skipped to v110) and incorporates
  v110    changes requested by several Sysops.  Installation of this
          program was becoming a nightmare, even for experienced RCP/M
          operators.  Many confusing and redundant equates have been
          eliminated.  The installer no longer need be concerned about
          running BYE low or high, or where his BDOS page starts.  The
          need to install computer dependent code has been eliminated.
          Previous versions could be assembled with combinations of
          equates that could result in assembler errors, or worse,
          crash the system.  A new option ($O) has been added to dis-
          play ONLY system (.SYS) files.  Simplicity and security were
          the results.

11/11/85  Made the fixes mentioned (by Ernest Hintz) in SD105.BUG.
  v107    Option equates comments edited to be logical and make it
          easier for first-time users to set up.  Slight modification
          to header.  Normal system equate settings are in lower
          case (as in BYE5) - makes it easier to spot them.

If you are unable to access SIMTEL-20 because of network restrictions
please remember that MOST of the new files announced to Info-Cpm are
also available on my RCPM Royal Oak (MI) which may be accessed at 300
bps using the 103a modem mode or 1200 bps using either the 212a or
Vadic 3400 modes.  The telephone number is (313) 759-6569.

Replace this line with my red face.

To all of you who replied to my previous message, thanks.

Obviously many of you noticed that I failed to read the manual
before sitting down to use Turbo Pascal, and I expected the CPM
version to handle the recursion as any normal compiler would.

My version of the CS 112 project now works, thanks to you all,
and the poor students get the assignment next Tuesday.

One person wrote saying that the program worked on a PC
version of Turbo directly, as expected.  At least my
Software Toolworks C Compiler handles recursion, and I got 
it working without reading the manual.  I was just lucky
I guess.

Thanks to all again -

[ ... go ahead, eat my bits ... ]

I've had several people ask me for the address of "Micro/Systems Journal"
that I mentioned in a previous posting, so thought I'd post it to the net.
M/SJ is put out by Sol and Lennie Libes (more or less out of their "garage")
as a replacement for the now defunct "Microsystems" magazine.

"Microsystems" was started by the Libes' back in the "early days" of micro-
computing as a *technical* magazine;  "Micro/Systems Journal" editorial
content continues in that tradition.  They're aimed at the CP/M and MS-DOS
technical community, but also have regular columns for UNIX, Turbo Pascal, C,
Data Bases, and the Scientific User.  Two other regular features are columns
that cover current releases of public domain s/w:  "PC/Blue Report" for the
MS/PC-DOS people, and "SIG/M Public Domain" for CP/M'ers.

Since their 1st issue, they seem to have picked up a fair amount of adver-
tising support (editorial/advertising ratio seems to be about the same as
Dr. Dobb's Journal has), and the technical content continues to improve.
If you're technically oriented, I think you'll enjoy the magazine.  Best of
luck to Sol, Lennie, et al in this venture.

Here's the address:

		Micro/Systems Journal
		PO Box 1192
		Mountainside, NJ 07092

A sample issue is $4 ... $6 foreign.

					Canada/	   other
				US	Mexico	  foreign
			       ----     -------   -------
Subscription rates are:  1-yr  $20	  $28	    $35
			 2-yr  $35	  $52	    $64
			 		  (US funds on US bank only, please)

Currently, they are publishing bi-monthly, and all their back-issues are
available for $4.50 each, including shipping ($6 foreign).  Back-issues
can be ordered from the address given above.


Here it comes ... disclaimer:  I only read the magazine, I haven't written
for it, I don't own stock in it or advertise in it, nor am I affiliated
with it in any other way.  If anybody out there in net.land feels I am
"commercializing" here, you are invited to send flames to the Tooth-Fairy :-).

All opinions expressed are my own, not those of my employer, roommate, or
pet camel.

	Because I happened to have a copy of my Turbo Pascal
compiler handy, I tried the above program in Turbo.  When I ran
the program, I received the second set of outputs given in the
above article.  The version of Turbo that I have is identified
as ver. 3.01A for the IBM.  Apparently, Borland either corrected
this problem in the subsequent point (.01) release or there is 
a significant difference between the CP/M and IBM versions of 
Turbo.  Hopes this helps in tracking down the problem.

For every problem there is one           	Dave Beyerl
solution which is simple, neat,                 ihuxk!db21
and wrong!

Subject:  FORTH compiler product description:

Fellow CP/Mers - I have received information describing Forth compilers (as
opposed to Forth interpreters) for Z-80 and 8086 family targets running on
CP/M-80 (Z-80 processor, Z-80 target, only) or MS-DOS (any target) hosts.
Salient features of these compilers are:

1) Generate headerless, rommable, code.  Considerable optimizations 
   are claimed -- generated code is said to be as good as or better than
   other available compilers for C or Pascal.  Source code can be either a
   Forth screen file or a standard ASCII text file.
2) Meets 83 standard, excepting for words which assume the presence of a
   dictionary in the target (remember, no headers) or perform BLOCK 
   accesses.
3) Defining words allowed, as well as interpret state during compilation,
   so that most Forth applications can be compiled with little modification.
4) Assembler (for target processor) included.
5) Forward referencing of colon or code words is handled automatically.
6) Single pass compile and link.  Links from libraries that are source
   code, including only those words needed.  This means low overhead on
   small programs.  Simple things like the Byte benchmark compile into
   minimal sized, 1k, COM files.
7) Compilation speed is slower than in-memory compilers such as BDS-C or
   Turbo Pascal, but faster than disk-bound compilers.  For instance, the
   one-step compile time is roughly the same as the compile step of AZTEC
   C, but with AZTEC C you still have to assemble and link.
8) Includes many demonstration programs (utilities equivalent to TR, WC
   TAIL, and UNIQ, forth screen management, benchmarks) and libraries for
   83 Standard Forth, dos nterface, and software floating point.

This information was provided by the author, Tom Almy.  I have no personal
knowledge of or experience with this product.

     Requests for additional information may be directed to Laboratory Micro-
systems, P.O. Box 10430, Marina del Rey, CA 90295, phone (213) 306-7412.
Price is $300 for any version.

Yes, yes, I know what you're saying - skip CP/M 3.0 and go to ZCPR3!!
BUT...
I can't modify the BIOS/BDOS without knowing what to make of what's there
now, so I'm sending out the call:
    >>>> I NEED THE CP/M 3.0 PROGRAMMER'S GUIDE <<<<
Since DR no longer supports it, I have no qualms about asking for photocopies
and other questionable sources.  If you have it, I want a copy!!
I'll even RENT yours so I can make my own copy!!!

 The problem is simple!! Turbo does not default to
recusion on. They do this to gain some speed. To
turn on recusion use the directive

 {$A-}

 Turbo is just doing what you told it to do.

Under the PC-DOS version of Turbo 3.0, the program runs correctly with
the same output as you have given for the other Pascals. The problem
may be associated with the CP/M-80 Compiler Directive "A". The default
is "A+" which inhibits recursive code. Switching to "A-" may solve your
problem. This is documented on or about page 318 in the 3.0 manual.

Subject: XCAT42 problem fixed - XCAT43 now available

    Last February we were in touch about a problem which I was having
    with the MCAT series of programs. You referred me to mcat45, the
    latest version, which was not the one which I have been using.
    Owing to work pressures, I did not get around to the problem
    again till this week.

    The problem is still present.  MCAT.COM successfully creates a
    MAST.CAT of arbitrarily many entries with no difficulties. BUT,
    XCAT42.COM is able to print out only up to 256 entries in
    MAST.CAT.  If the entries are greater in number, it wipes
    everything out and cycles back to an empty listing and the
    statement to the effect that there is one line one entry.  I have
    checked the asm versions of both mcat and xcat, USER is NO in
    both cases. I have rerun them through the assembler and compared
    the output files with the library .COM files.  They are
    identical.

The problem has been fixed.  Now available from SIMTEL20:

Filename			Type	 Bytes	 CRC

Directory PD:<CPM.CATLOG>
XCAT43.LBR.1			BINARY	 30592  24BCH

For those who don't have this disk cataloging package yet:

MCAT45.LBR.2			BINARY	 83968  3EC9H

which contains MCAT45, XCAT43 and several utilities.  Only the XCAT
files have been changed in MCAT45.LBR.

If you want to modify the BIOS, you need the "CP/M Plus System Guide"
along with a bunch of programs like "gencpm.com" and some .SPR files.
I have my "build" automated using "make", and it simplifies
thing a good bit, but otherwise....

CP/M 3.0 in my case supports bankswitching and (obviously) timestamps.
It is substantially better than 2.2 although things here and there
make you scratch your head.

Anybody have a copy of the banked BDOS source (commented?) ? :-)

Subject: Multiuser Micro Result
To: info-cpm@AMSAA.ARPA
Cc: rbloom@apg-1.ARPA

People:

     A number of months ago I sent a request for information on
multi-user computers.  Thanks to all that responded.  This is a
recap of what happened to that request.

     I work in the Department of Defence, in the Test and
Evaluation Command of the Army Materiel Command (AMC).  The
machine in question would be used in my division and would
replace a well-used and trusted NorthStar Horizon.  Based on the
responses, I thought I had a pretty good handle on what was
available that met my requirements and was affordable.  I was
looking for a system that would be less expensive than AMC's
'standard' micro (an Intel 310).  Priminary research indicated
that there were some potentials at 1/3 of the price of an Intel
and lots at 1/2 the price.  (The Intel system was *at*least*
$50k.)

     I've been shot down in the attempt to save some taxpayer
money.  (How's that for an inflammatory statement?)

     From a AMC letter dated 19 May 85 on "Policy of Acquisition
and Use of Microcomputers", "[the Intel contract] is a mandatory
source for single-user and multi-user microcomputers for AMC
activities whose requirements can be satisfied by the contract."
Cost savings, no matter how much, is not a basis for buying
anything other than items on the contract.  Our ADPE acquisition
people are using this to beat everyone down, me included.  (We
can't even buy a plain-vanila IBM-PC any more!)

     This is not to say that the Intel 310 is not a good machine.
It's just that I don't believe that a single machine, albeit
configurable in many different ways to meet many different
requirements, is best for all those requirements.  Oh well.

     So like a good military man (which I'm not) after stating my
view, I am supporting whatever decision the commander makes.
Looks like I'll be buying an Intel 310 ethernet'ed to 8 PC
clones.

     Thanks again to those that helped me in my research.  I felt
that I had an obligation to those kind net-people that sometimes
never find out the results of the issues mentioned here.

Hi,

I need quite a few Pocket Computers for an application. Needed specs are:

	- Must be as cheap as possible, hopefully under $50 (VERY IMPORTANT)
	- Run Basic (or some programming language)
	- Minimal RAM (1K is OK)



The only one I found that meets my requirements is a Radio Shack
Tandy PC4. Is Tandy PC4 made by Sharp? Are there any others?

Any info will be greatly appreciated.

Subject:  Linking Xerox 860s to PCs

Has anyone out there had experience linking the 860 Xerox wordprocessor with
PCs?  The 860 is CP/M-based, with 8" disks.  We would like to, at the
minimum, transfer files back and forth, but being able to spool files to other
printers would be dandy as well.

I'm requesting this for a friend -- I know next to nothing about the 860s, and
Xerox hasn't been real helpful to her yet, so I'm hoping that someone has
already figured this one out.  I have experience with MSDOS Kermit, and
wondered whether Kermit would do.  There is a version for the Xerox 820, but I
don't know whether it'll work.

I'm sending this to info-cpm as well, but if anyone has suggestions about
where else to look, I'd love to hear.

Thanks --

   I am using MEX to transfer files between two CP/M systems.  I have MEX 1.11
on one system and MEX 1.14 on the other.  I cannot send files from 1.14 to
1.11 at any rate faster than 1200 baud, thought I can send from 1.11 to 1.14
at 19.2kbaud.  Is the problem that I am using two different versions of MEX?
The 1.14 is running on a Xerox 820, while 1.11 is on a MicroSoft CP/M (Apple
II+) system.

John - the 860, if set-up for communications can send/rec ascii files from the
word processor side of the machine.  As far as sending CP/M files, I don't know.

One gotcha on the WP files.  Xerox screwed around with the proportional 
space handling on the 860.  If you use proportional and justification, you
can get one or two extra characters on a line (e.g., 72 on a 70 character
line.).  This really messes things up if you are trying to move a justified
document from the 860 to another machine and edit it on the second machine.
The easy way around this is dondon't use proportional space and justification
on any document you want to transfer.

Hope this helps.

Can't mail to you, though.
Send (or post?) your US mail addr, or ph# if you're
still looking for info.

Is there an install of ZCPR3 for the Kaypro 2x? A local SysOp is
looking for one and has had no luck in the LA area at all. If
you know where I can get one for him, please leave me mail on the
nets. Thanks.
