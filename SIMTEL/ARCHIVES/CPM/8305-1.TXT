These aren't earth-shaking breakthroughs in computer science, but they

Hi again.  Thanks to all of you who responded to my first query about CP/M
and Digital Research.  I didn't get as many responses as I really need, so
I'm trying again.

For those of you who missed it:  I am soliciting comments, suggestions,
complaints and other correspondence to be sent to appropriate High Ups in
Digital Research.  The reason for this request is that I believe DRI is
out-of-touch with their 'hacker' customer base, and I like to give them some
feedback.  

Pretty much, I'd like to hear anything that you have to say.  All messages
will be confidential, unless you send a copy to the appropriate list.
Suggestions for further enhancements to CP/M or ideas for other products are
especially welcome.

Cheers,
Tony ;-)  <Li @ Rutgers>

Subject: XMODEM74 now available
To: INFO-CPM@brl.arpa

XMODEM74 is now available on MIT-MC.  This is a worthwhile
update for RCPM operators who are using older versions.
It includes the ability to send individual files from
.LBR files and has RP (Receive Private) option which allows
caller to send private files to the SYSOP.

XMODEM is NOT meant to replace MODEM.  It is for use on
unattended Remote CP/M systems.

The files are in CPM;AR63:
XMACAT 74ASM   --  Apple CAT modem I/O overlay
XMDCH  74ASM   --  D.C. Hayes I/O overlay
XMEXT  74ASM   --  External serial port I/O overlay
XMEXT  74NEW   --  Ditto, with enhancements
XMHZ89 74ASM   --  Heath/Zenith I/O overlay
XMINT3 74ASM   --  Interfacer 3 I/O overlay
XMMMII 74ASM   --  D.C. Hayes Micro-Modem II I/O overlay
XMODEM 74ASM   --  Main program source code
XMODEM 74INF   --  Information on the files in this package
XMODEM 74MSG   --  Message announcing the package
XMPMMI 74ASM   --  PMMI MM103 I/O overlay
XMSMDM 74ASM   --  D.C. Hayes Smart Modem I/O overlay

Here's more detailed information:

TOPIC:  XMODEM74
FROM :  IRV HOFF W6FFC
DATE :  04 APR 83

     XMODEM is a program used primarily on remotely operated RCPM systems
that allows program transfer to and/or from remote users.  It can trans-
fer any type of CP/M file including absolute binary files (.OBJ).
     Originally written by Keith Petersen and based at that time on Ward
Christensen's MODEM ver 2.0 it has since undergone extensive revision.
     Nearly every new version has tacked on yet another computer/modem
combination.  It has grown very unwieldy in size and awkward to handle.
     In a major contribution to simplifying the program, Sigi Kluger with
his XMODEM 6.8 stripped out all the various hardware configurations.  He
wound up with a jump table at the beginning that permits use of external
overlay files for a particular computer/modem.  
     The current version is XMODEM 7.4.  The 7.x series has several new
features which give it a tremendous flexibility.  Major recent additions
include:
 
     1) A general purpose menu.  Just type:

	   A0>XMODEM <return> 

	   This menu includes the drive/user area for normal uploading.
	   (The A0> prompt in this and subsequent examples is shown as a
	   typical possibilty of a drive/user area you may be in.)

     2) Ability to send (download to the remote user) member files from
	   a library group (.LBR)  without having to copy the entire li-
	   brary file.  (Use a separate program called LDIR.COM to find
	   the member names of a library group.)
	        
     3) Ability to specify what disk/user area from which to send a pro-
	   gram so the remote user doesn't have to go to that area first:

	   A0>XMODEM S B6:HELLO.DOC

	   (An option limits the maximum user area.)  
 
     4) Programs can be uploaded to a special non-public user area for
	   the exclusive use of the SYSOP.  These can include replacement
	   programs for one already on some public area, experimental
	   programs you wish him to test before making them public, pre-
	   typed notes for his exclusive reading or any program you wish
	   him to see that is not appropriate for public use at that time.

     5) Ability to download from a special area.  This enables the SYSOP
	   to place special programs, pretyped messages, etc. in this
	   area.  He can then leave a private message on his bulletin
	   board to the person for whom the program is intended.  Al-
	   though any user COULD download that program, only the SYSOP
	   and his intended recepient know the its correct name.  This
	   provides excellent security.  The SYSOP can thus make any per-
	   son an instant temporary privileged user.  This gives him a
	   tremendous flexibility he has not previously had.

     6) Spaces can now be used without error.  Example:

	   A0>XMODEM   L   B7:   CATALOG    CAT2.DOC

	   will send a file called CAT2.DOC from the CATALOG.LBR library.
	   NOTE:  The  .LBR extent need not be included.  If not, it is
                  added automatically.

To: tcarnahan@usc-isie.arpa
cc: Info-Cpm@brl.arpa

Unlike most other machines on the net, MC (and the other ITS machines,
ML, AI, and DM), does not require you to login when using FTP access.
Also, we have the CPM; directory full of plain files and something
called ARChive files.  ARChive files contain files and are referenced
by a device name.  Thus, to reference a regular file to fetch it into
your machine via FTP, type:

GET CPM;fn1 fn2<cr>
local-filename<cr><cr>

For a file in an ARChive:

GET CPM;ARnn:fn1 fn2<cr>
local-filename<cr><cr>

Of course, you need to know the name of the file in the first place,
and if it is in an ARChive, the "nn", or ARChive number.  To do this,
type:

DIR CPM;<cr>
TTY:<cr>

And the list will show on your terminal - you can substitute a
local-filename instead of TTY: and it will go there instead for you to
reference later.  In that list, you will see files, like AR60 MODEM2,
as well as the regular files which are not of the form ARnn fn2.  AR60
MODEM2 is an archive file.  To find out what is in that archive, type:

DIR CPM;AR60:<cr>
TTY:<cr>

One file you will see on that list is MBOOT 3ASM.  If you want to
fetch that file to your machine, type:

GET CPM;AR60:MBOOT 3ASM<cr>
MBOOT3.ASM<cr><cr>          (the name you want to use on your host)

Of course, to start up the program assume you have access to FTP:

FTP<cr>
MC<cr>
.....	<-- do your DIRs and GETs here
BYE<cr>
QUIT<cr>

Any questions?  Contact FJW@MC.

The latest version of MODEM7 is MDM707.  It's available here on MIT-MC
in the CPM; directory to those who have ArpaNet access.  You should
call your nearest RCPM (as listed in the RCPMLIST I sent out on the
net recently) to see what files they have available.  In many cases
RCPMs have later versions than the user groups are supplying on disks.

Subject: S100 Hard disk query
To: info-cpm@mit-mc.arpa

CP/Mers,

Rutgers University has been supporting an RCPM system for about two
years now.  The system has been running with two single density 8"
ICOM floppy disk drives and an ICOM controller.  After all the system
software and message files are put on these low density disks, there
isn't much room left for programs to be uploaded and downloaded.  The
project group that has been supporting this bulletin board has decided
that they want to support a larger scale system and want to use a hard
disk system to increase storage space.  I have been looking through BYTE
magazine and some others and have found many ads for controllers and 
drives and stuff, but have not found the complete package that we need.
If anyone can help with info about a system that will do the following.
please reply to me (JOSEPH@Rutgers) and I will forward a compendium to
the net.
REQUIREMENTS-
    S100 controller that will run with a Cromemco z80 4Mhz processor and that
         comes with either an attach bios for CPM 2.2 or a complete bios for
	 CPM 2.2 or CPM plus.  Integral backup system controller would be
         a plus (built in cartridge tape system......)

    DISK box containing Hard disk drive(s) and power supply.  We are
         looking for a winchester system with about 20 megabytes storage
         capacity. ( a removable cartridge system would be preferred)

    COMPLETE backup system,  Either cartridge tape, high density floppy
         or winchester.  We have been using video tape for backup on an 
	 apple hard disk and have found it to be slow and not too reliable.

I need recommendations on which manufacturers, if any, make entire snap on
subsystems like this or, if separate manufacturers devices are needed,
which ones work together well.

Subject:  Re:  ZCPR2 ON APPLE

I have heard of people installing ZCPR2 on Apples.   Someone  ap-
proached  me  at  an ACG-NJ meeting the other day and said he had
and that it ran nicely.  I suspect, however, that  it  is  not  a
full installation.

With all of the options to ZCPR2 at installation time, it is pos-
sible to install it on virtually any Z80-based system.  I recent-
ly installed it on a  Morrow  Design's  MicroDecision  with  200K
floppies.   Morrow  was  willing to provide source to his BIOS on
disk FOR FREE, and, with  this,  it  was  possible  to  implement
external  paths  and  the multiple command line buffer.  The only
noticable difference was that the installed system did  not  have
named  directories  (because it didn't seem to make sense in only
200K, but it was still possible) and redirectable I/O (because of
the limited I/O facilities of the MicroDecision, but again it was
possible).

Hence, after the experience with the MicroDecision, I'd say  that
it  is  possible  to  install ZCPR2 on most any Z80-based system.
The degree of installation is the only question.

Cc: info-cpm@brl.arpa


I beat the vt180.  I have successfully gotten mboot3 running
on the little sucker.  The port poop revealed in the letter excerpt
below is only part of the solution:

	From: Dick <MEAD@USC-ECLB>
	Subject: Re: vt180 port poop

	COMM port values are:
		DATA=58H
		STAT=59H	TBE=01,RDA=02

	CONSOLE values are:
		DATA=40H
		STAT=41H	(I assume same bit values)

	One gotcha, I read that interrupts are used in the VT180,
	so MBOOT3 and other adaptations to this system may need
	to do some trickery to work at all. I had used the right
	bits/addresses in one try and still no good.
	-------

The real trick is that since incoming characters are handled by interrupts,
the usart will never seem to have any characters ready when it is polled
by mboot3 in the normal fashion.  Rather then do what I suggested in an
earlier letter, i.e. turn off the interrupts, I did what DEC did in the
RDR: device handler in the vt180 bios.  That is, I poll the memory locations
that the interrupt handler uses to communicate with the bios.  In the latest
version of CPM that DEC is supplying [2.2 (1.1)], *the magic locations are:*

	0f541h	=	rec'd data available if == 1
	0f546h	=	rec'd character

The code to check for status in mboot3 is thus:

	before:				|	after:
	in	modctlp			|	lda	0f541h
	ani	modrcvr			|
	cpi	modrcvr			|	ora	a
	jnz	term	;no char rec'd	|	jz	term	;no char rec'd

and the code to get the rec'd char is now:

	in	moddatp			|	mvi	a,0	;clear status
	ani	7fh			|	sta	0f541h
					|	lda	0f546h	;get char
					|	ani	7fh

I got the magic location values by disassembling the bios RDR: handler.
Once you get past the IOBYTE nonsense, the handler loads the IX register
with the location of the status table for the RDR: device, and jumps to
a routine that polls the memory locations pointed to by the IX register
to wait for a char to come in.  The magic locations listed above are
actually IX+2 and IX+7 in the RDR: handler.  These location are likely
to change if DEC releases a new version of the bios.

I haven't gotten mdm707 running yet, although I'm close.  The overlay
method won't work since the code size of the routines is so different 
from that in the standard version of mdm707.  Instead, the entire mdm707.asm
file must be edited and re-assembled.  Since the little toy disks on
the vt180 are so small, I do the editing and assembling on another CPM
machine and use mboot3 to bring over the com file.  Time has not permitted
me to finish the debug of mdm707 as a result of all the kludges.

Let me know if you get any revelations on the vt180.

					good luck--

As a favor, I tried to help a doctor learn how to use his Condor software
(and a few other things) over a period of about 8 hours, two months ago.
Since I've never used dBase II, I have no real basis for comparison, but I
found the Condor package to be quite difficult to use. The manual varies in
quality from section to section, with some parts being excellent (easy to
understand, even for a non-cs person, containing examples and good English
explanations of use), and others extremely shoddy (missing important
information, out of date, or outright incorrect).

The data entry form generation command is not too bad, although it is
difficult for persons accustomed to full-featured screen editors to get used
to.  The instructions on cursor movement did not correspond to actual
functioning (possibly the fault of the Alspa keyboard, which is what we were
using); commands that should have been "universal" were available only in
one mode or another.

Certain functions are poorly explained, such as use of the RESULTS file
(which I hadn't figured out how to use by the end of the day), how to modify
existing data to add or delete fields (the REORGanize command, an
exercise in extreme frustration).

Condor commands are run from a sort of CP/M shell which must be invoked with
the current date and software license number.  The Condor shell allows most
of the normal CP/M commands (when preceded by a $"), but looks for .DBM
files rather than .COM files when commands are typed.  You can write
"scripts," containing conditional expressions and other flow control
constructs, to be submitted to the Condor shell (I did not get around to
trying this).

Well, hope this is somewhat informative.  I'd like to hear a about
about comparisons Condor or dBase II if anyone out there knows about them.

Does anyone out there know what protocol MODEM uses to accomplish its
batch mode?  I have a program that transfers files from my RT-11 system
to and from my VT180 CP/M system but would like to be able to transfer
in batch mode also.  I have a document that describes the single file
at a time protocol but it doesn't say anything about the batch mode and
how filenames are transfered.  I'd also be interested an algorithm for
implementing the CRC transfer checking instead of the standard checksum.

Thanks in advance,

No, it's not possible to sucessfully FTP the whole ARchive file.
Reason is that the format of the ARchive files on ITS machines is not
compatible with any others I'm aware of.  If you figure out a program
to extract files from an ITS archive without having to be on ITS to do
it, let me know.  Those files are binary in some areas and ASCII in
others.  The best way right now is to FTP each individual file you
want.  If your host supports a utility that works like CP/M's SUBMIT,
you might be able to make up a list beforehand and let the program do
all the work while you go out for coffee.

I have gotten a version of Modem working on the VT-180 but have used
a slightly different approach than that reported earlier.  Rather
than check the status of the port by attacking the magic control block
location in the bios, I installed an interrupt trap between the
RST location and the system interrupt handler.  This gives me first
crack at incoming data from the communication line before the vt-180
BIOS can get its hands on it.  As it turns out, the device handler
for the communication line likes to ignore certain characters (like
NUL) which can thoroughly upset file transfer.  This method gives
me everything and allows me to sense disconnection, parity errors,
overruns and framing errors as well.

As part of INITMOD:

...
	LHLD	00011H		;load interrupt handler address
	SHLD	INTHAND+1	;store in jump location
	LXI	H,RXINT		;load trap routine address
	DI			;be careful
	SHLD	00011h		;save in RST10 JMP address
	EI			;let it go
...

Now, in an independent module:

RXINT	PUSH	A		;save register
	IN	059H		;read status port
	STA	COMSTAT		;save value
	ANI	02H		;is this our interrupt?
	JZ	RXRET		;no
	IN	058H		;get incoming character
	STA	COMBYTE		;save it
RXRET	POP	A		;restore accumulator
INTHAND JMP	$-$		;exit through system
COMSTAT	DB	0		;result of status port read
COMBYTE	DB	0		;result of data port read


Your recieve data handler can then treat the locations COMSTAT and
COMBYTE as if they were memory mapped IO, though your transmit
data routine must use ported IO.

Clearly, there are a number of more complicated things one can do
with this approach, including building a ring buffer to buffer
incoming data until something as slow as Microsoft Basic can get to
it.

				Good Luck,

One comment about your code to get a character:

	|	mvi	a,0	;clear status
	|	sta	0f541h
	|	lda	0f546h	;get char
	|	ani	7fh

It's easy to get burned on an interlock such as this.  In general, you
should get the character and THEN reset the status; the way it's now coded,
there is a critical time (between the STA and the LDA) where another
interrupt could come along and trash 0F546h.  Granted, it probably doesn't
matter in this case anyway (I'm sure an overrun would mess other things
up), and yes, it does require extra storage to hold the char while you're
mucking with the status (use a spare register or the stack).  I just wanted
to make the point -- I've been caught on this one and it required an awful
lot of head-scratching to figure out what was going on.

Someone on Compuserve's CP-MIG has put ZCPR2 on the Apple.  I downloaded
the files necessary to convert Microsoft's CPM56.COM to install ZCPR2
instead of the standard CCP.  The person implemented several of ZCPR2's
neat features.  Unfortunately, doing so required the use of the I/O
driver patch area.  Users like me who require the use of that area for
I/O drivers are out of luck.  I use the Mountain Computer CPS card for
modem and printer.  When I tried loading the drivers on top of the ZCPR2
configured system, everything started getting "funny".  Once again, I
resolved never to buy a CP/M system without BIOS source.  Ron.

Once again I feel that Workman is trying to rip off the public selling
PUBLIC DOMAIN (!!) software at outrageous prices.  What is reasonable?
Let's see...

Single-sided/single-density 8" diskettes can be gotten cheap!  I assume
Mr. Workman does enough business where he can buy diskettes in large
enough quantity, that he can get them even cheaper than you and me, but
let's assume not, and say he can get a box of SSSD diskettes for around
$25.00, or $2.50 a diskette.  Let's also assume that he can get someone
to actually do the work of copying the diskettes for $4.00/hour.  If it
takes two minutes to load, copy, and verify a diskette, that's 30
diskettes an hour, or roughly 14 cents per copied diskette.  So far the
diskette costs $2.64, but you have to mail it, and the US SNAIL people
must get their share.  Let's assume that it takes another five minutes
for someone to place the diskettes into a mailer and make out an
address label, or about 34 cents in labor.  Add a generous $1.00 a
diskette for shipping, and our total is now only $3.98.  Which you're
saying Workman then marks up to $14.00???  Assuming that Workman sells
the entire group of 14 diskettes, that's $140 of profit off of someone
else's labors!  That's not what my idea of public domain is all about!

Hopefully enough RCPM systems and computer clubs will get ahold of the
ZCPR2 distribution that the general public won't be forced to pay these
inflated prices.  It's unfortunate that people who don't know better
will continue to be ripped off by Workman.

It is apparent that some INFO-CPM subscribers do not understand the
concept of public domain software.  It is not the case that anyone
possessing PD software is obligated to give it away, or to make it
available at cost.  The whole point of public domain is that anyone can
do with it as they please.

When I take my SCUBA tanks to be filled, I pay five dollars for a few
dozen pounds of air.  But, following unisoft!pertec's argument, air can
be gotten cheap!  Assume that the owner of the diving shop actually
pays someone to do the work of filling the tanks for $4.00/hour.  If it
takes six minutes to fill my tanks, that's 40 cents per customer.  But
isn't air in the public domain? .. Bojemoi, someone is ripping me off!

This of course totally ignores fixed costs.  Neither the local diving
shop nor Mr. Workman can operate without making regular payments of
rent, utilities, advertising, licensing, payments on capital equipment,
etc and gory etc.  (And that employee gets $4.00/hour whether or not
there's a customer in the shop.)  Last year I ran a software house,
selling my own (non-public domain) software, and, despite several thousands
of dollars in gross receipts, those fixed costs ran me four thousand into
the red.  (A half-page ad in last October's "Byte" cost $ 3,500.  That's a
lot of floppy disks.)

But all of this is beside the point.  Why should anyone be expected to
provide a product or a service without taking a profit?  And who
are you to tell someone that his profit is so unreasonable that he's
ripping you off?  The only definition of a reasonable price in a
capitalist society is the price that a reasonable number of customers
will pay.  If you don't like the price, don't pay it.

Altruistic programmers who desire that noone should ever have to pay money
for their software should not mark it "public domain", but should apply a
label such as "copyright (c) 1983 by joe blow; may be freely copied for
non-commercial purposes".  But they should understand that such software
will only be available through underground channels.  The novice who can't
afford a modem and hasn't the time to get involved with a user group may
never find out about your whiz-bang spelling checker, simply because nobody
will be motivated to tell him about it and give him the opportunity to
acquire it.

Has anybody out there got a copy of smallc or smallc v2 running under
North Start DD CPM? I got the source to smallc v2 off net.sources and
would like to bring it up, but I thought I'd save myself alot of work
and ask if anybody has already done that. Of course, I'd be willing to
pay for copy / shipping charges, etc.

Subject: ITS .COM file format explained
To: ciaraldi@rochester.arpa
cc: Info-Cpm@brl.arpa

(Thanks to GZ@MC for this excellent explanation of how .COM files are
stored on ITS).

COM files are stored on ITS as four 8-bit bytes per PDP-10 word, left
justified.  The first word is a file-type identifier and it is
446353300000 octal.  This particular packing of 8 bit bytes into
pdp-10 words is pretty standard, so if your FTP has a binary mode, it
will probably do the right thing, i.e. give you the correct sequence
of 8-bit bytes coming out of the FTP. If that is the case, the first 4
bytes should be: 223, 072, 330, 0 (octal). These come from the id word
above and are not part of the com file proper, i.e. should be
discarded before downloading to a CP/M system.

Now, if you don't have binary mode in your FTP, or if the binary mode
is such that you get something other 223,072,330,0 as first four bytes
when FTPing COM files (meaning that the server is using some other
byte packing), it might still be possible to FTP the files and
reconstruct the original from that. (The only problem might be CRLF
vs. LF transformations in ascii mode).  All you need to do figure out
how the server unpacks the bytes and then "undo" it.  I'd be happy to
help out if you have trouble figuring this out.  Just let me know what
the first few bytes are when you FTP a com file.  But before you go
writing any code, make sure there is no way to make FTP win directly.

From: Gail Zacharias <GZ at mit-mc.arpa>
Re:   ITS binary format

There are two separate issues here.  First is packing 8 bit bytes into
PDP-10's 36 bit words.  This is unavoidable, standard, and the ITS ftp
server deals with it just fine.  The problem is getting the unix user
end to tell ITS to do it. SEE BELOW FOR HOW TO DO THIS.

The second problem is the 4-byte header put in the binary CP/M files
stored in the CPM; directory. This has nothing to do with ITS, and was
a decision made by those involved with maintaining this directory and
related programs.  SEE BELOW FOR HOW TO DEAL WITH THIS.

I might suggest that someone fix umodem to recognize those header
bytes (they are 93H,3AH,D8H,00H) and strip them off.  umodem could
also use them for their intended purpose, differentiating between
ascii and binary files, so the user wouldn't have to give a "b" switch
(I assume that's what the -sb below does). The TOPS-20 modem program
already does this.

Anyhow, unix people, here are the answers:

Re:   downloading .com files

Thanks for the protocol, which enabled our resident expert, jim
guyton, to develop this method of downloading binary files. At
Rand-unix we are using a version of the BBN ftp program.

1. to retrieve "AR14:CPM;NAMEXX COM" from mit-mc:

	ftp mit-mc
	type i
	quote type "l 8"
	get "AR14:CPM;NAMEXX COM" longnamexx.com
	bye

2. to strip off the 4 header bytes:

	dd
	if=longnamexx.com
	of=namexx.com
	bs=1
	skip=4

3. to download to a cpm machine:

	umodem -sb namexx.com

Dave, I called the company who makes the AS100 hard disk floppy

consider it's a very easy way to add a hard disk to any
Shugart-compatible floppy system.

I don't know what Workman's personal busniess situation is,
but I do believe that your estimate of how much it costs to
buy, duplicate, and mail a disk is rather unrealistic.

Let's take a look:  first the disks; yes, you can buy them
cheaply. Yet, you still have to buy them, store them, and
restock. The disk duplication is seldom done by someone being
paid $4.00/hr and does not take a mere two minutes.  The
actual duplication may take only that long, but workers are
slow (unfortunately) and usually take twice as long to do
simple procedures as they should.

Mialing:  do you have any idea how much it costs to do
mailings? I mean, the carton alone may cost $.50! Postage for
14 disks is not going to be $1.00 either.  I spend that much
on one 5.25".  There is addressing, packaging, weighing, and
the actual process of mailing (going to UPS, paying for their
pickup, whatever).

Now, what about overhead.  The mail must be picked up,
processed.  There is accounting on your check or charge. You
get a receipt.  Plus, general business overhead, taxes (arg!),
insurance, ad nauseum.  This *costs*!  The idea that you are
going to get some non-volunteer to do this correctly for $4 is
absurd. The people I have working for me wouldn't even talk
for less than $7.

I think people have a very warped sense of costs in this
industry. I know that realistically, $10 is the minimum price
for single diskette where I don't want to run the risk of
subsidizing the exchange.  Non-profit groups can do it for
less, and it would be nice if those groups did handle ALL
public domain software.  However, volunteers are hard to come
by. I think that we should be quite happy that anything is
available at duplication cost.

Besides, you can always download stuff from your local RCPM.
Of course, if its LDx, you'll be paying a lot more for a
single 8" disk full of software than $14.

I am not trying to defend any specific practices.  It seems to
me that $140 is a bit steep for 14 disks in the same package
with no paper documentation.  Since it is public domain, you
can always split the cost with a friend or two and cut the
costs to you all. -r

Subject:  ZCPR2 and the PD

        This message is divided into three sections:

                ZCPR2 Distribution (and its problems)
                Public Education
                Conclusion and a Statement about the Public Domain

I thought this community may be interested in my comments.

I.  ZCPR2 Distribution

        It looks like a distribution system for ZCPR2 is  now  in
place.   It  has been quite an experience talking to groups about
ZCPR2, trying to lend some support to helping them get copies  of
ZCPR2  if  they  want it, and trying to do this without consuming
all of my time.  I think that something is finally  in  place  so
that if anyone wants a copy of it, they can get it.

        You can now get copies of the ZCPR2 distribution, in  one
form  or  another,  from  MIT-MC, Compuserve, Tymnet, SIG/M, some
RCPM systems, some computer clubs, and Workman.  All  have  their
tradeoffs  in  terms of time required by one who wants a copy and
cost, and both time and cost vary widely between these options.

        Computer clubs may be the best sources.  You go to a club
meeting with two boxes of disks, copy the disks, pay either noth-
ing or a token fee (which is usually used to further support club
activities),  and  walk away with ZCPR2.  You now have the system
and can run it, but you may not have a hard copy of the  manuals.
That  is  another  matter  entirely.   If you have WordStar and a
printer, you can take the time and print the 400+  pages  of  the
manuals  from your disks.  If you club has the money (and can af-
ford to do it), you may be able to  buy  the  manuals  from  your
club.   Or, you may send off to the NYACC for copies of the manu-
als at $24 for the set.

        You can access one of the networks mentioned and download
the  ZCPR2 system.  This is VERY time consuming to say the least,
and, because we are talking about over 1.5M bytes of  files,  all
of  the  files (such as source code) may not be available anyway.
Again, you don't have hardcopies of the manuals, so you have  the
NYACC or WordStar and your printer as options again.  Access to a
network may cost you money in terms of computer time on  the  net
and phone costs or both.

        You can access an RCPM system and download the ZCPR2 sys-
tem.   This has the disadvantages of the network access (with the
difference that network access may cost you  money  for  computer
time  on the host).  It adds the disadvantage that only some RCPM
systems carry ZCPR2, and you have to find out  which  ones.   The
Lincroft,  NJ RCPM is the only one I know of that is carrying the
entire system, but I have heard that others may be, in one degree
or  another.   I have heard that many RCPMs don't carry ZCPR2 be-
cause of its size.

        You can send off to SIGM for the  disks,  at  a  cost  of
$6/disk ($84 for all of ZCPR2 and SYSLIB).  Again, you won't have
hardcopies of the manuals without taking additional steps.

        Finally, there is Workman, who is providing a source  for
both the disks and manuals.  His cost is high, and he is probably
making a profit.  All of the other sources (with the possible ex-
ception  of  the  networks)  are  non-profit organizations run by
volunteers.

        I have heard complaints  from  people  trying  to  obtain
ZCPR2  from remote-access systems, such as the RCPMs and the net-
works.  Time and phone costs are  the  issues  here,  and  people
don't  want  to  spend the time or money to get it.  I have heard
complaints from people who send off to SIGM about the time  delay
for  a  turnaround.   Now I am hearing complaints about Workman's
cost (and profit).

        All of the sources for ZCPR2 have their drawbacks, but  I
don't  fault  any of them.  They all have a right to do what they
are doing, and they are all providing a service to the community.
It  is  up  to  the members of the community to select the source
they desire to obtain it from and then expend the effort (and mo-
ney)  to  obtain  it.  My only complaint is that many people have
tried to minimize their effort and expense to the point of coming
directly  to  me  and  asking me to expend even more effort on my
part to copy the system for them.  This  minimizes  their  effort
and  maximizes  mine.  I have resisted this, and will continue to
do so.  My love and talent  is  in  designing  programs  such  as
ZCPR2,  not  in  spending time and effort in copying them.  Other
people like to do this sort of thing, and I  leave  it  to  them.
Ever  since  the  release of ZCPR2, I have been so inundated with
such overhead that all other work has stopped, and  this  stagna-
tion has to (and will) stop.


II.  Public Education

        A growing problem, which is that of education of the user
community,  is not easily solved, but there is an excellent move-
ment afoot which is trying to solve it.  Microsystems Magazine (a
Ziff  Davis  Publication) now has a regular column devoted to the
public domain, and an article specifically on ZCPR2 will  be  ap-
pearing  soon.  With a readership of 50,000, this magazine should
be able to do a lot of good in educating the community.   I  note
that  Byte  has  been noticably lacking in providing this service
(with the exception of Sol's column).  I also note  that  DR  has
been  taking  steps recently to support its user community, and I
hope this sets a good example and continues,  encouraging  others
along the way.


III.  Conclusion

        In conclusion, what I am trying to say is that  this  may
be the beginning of a new era for public domain software, and the
commercial arena can work together with the public in this.   Mi-
crosystems  is providing a forum for educating the public.  DR is
providing backing (in words only so  far,  but  this  is  a  good
start).   And  Workman  is providing an alternative to the public
domain as a reliable source.  Coupled with the  information  pro-
vided  by  Microsystems (and, maybe someday, Byte), Workman's ac-
tion is fair, since the public should now be educated  enough  to
view  Workman  as  one of a multitude of sources rather than as a
sole source.

        I feel that the public domain has been failing.  There is
too  much  me-ism  in  this country, and there are too few people
willing to put forth some effort for the public good.   The  col-
lapse  of CPMUG in Chicago and the fact that the ACG-NJ (with its
1100+ members) is run (including SIGM) by only a handful of  peo-
ple are two examples of the problem we are facing.  The fact that
some RCPMs prefer to provide no ZCPR2 service at all rather  than
making  some  attempt  is another example.  The fact that so many
people have tried to impose upon me to  provide  ZCPR2  for  them
rather than expending the added effort to get it thru channels is
a third example.  People naturally (it seems) tend to go  out  of
their  ways  to  minimize  their time, effort, and expense and to
maximize their gain regardless of what it costs  others.   If  we
only band together, as a public, and expend a little extra effort
on each of our parts for  the  public  good  (without  getting  a
direct  benefit  necessarily), the public domain would be so much
better for all of us.

        I feel that, unless something is done, the public  domain
system  may  collapse  completely.  The user community is growing
rapidly  while the public domain continues  to  be  supported  by
just  a  few.   As more users become aware of it, make demands on
it, those few will become so inundated with work  that  they  may
become  discouraged and give up.  I have already experienced such
feelings, and am sure others have as well.

I have a *very* large CBIOS file (Morrow's, if you must know - 146K),
which contains EQUs and IF statements for every possible configuration
of disk drives and controllers of theirs.  I (and a neighbor) would
like to find some sort of preprocessor that would generate another
.ASM file containing only those sections of code that would normally
be processed by MAC - i.e., none of the code that fails the IF tests.

If there exists such a preprocessor, send me a pointer.  If it's
"public domain", I'll put it up here.

Subject: ZCPR2 sources
To: info-cpm@brl.arpa

I will be making the ZCPR2 files available on a temporary
RCPM in the near future. The system will have specific hours,
as it will run on my normal voice phone. It will also run at
1200 baud (212A) only! I will impose no time limit once a user
connects, so feel free to download all files at one time. The
only hitch is that the files will take up two 1.2 meg disks, so
I will have to alternate disks during the period the system is up.

Most likely I will change the disks every other day the system is 
active.... The first disk will have all the document files, while the
second will have all the source and .COM files. 

As soon as I have determined the hours of operation, I will post
it to the net. I will also be placing a minimal set of ZCPR2
files on my normal RCP/M system, room permitting. Note MINIMAL!

The normal system is Pasadena CBBS/RCPM @ 213-799-1632

Subject: MODEM 9.01
To: INFO-CPM@brl.arpa


	A new version of Ward Christensen's MODEM program is
contained in the library file MC:CPM;MODEM 901LBR. The files must
be unloaded from the library with LU and the text files unsqueezed
with USQ. The source files have been split into modules linkable
with Christensen's LASM. LASM and MLOAD (an improved hex loader by
Ron Fowler) are also included in the library. Documentation files
are also provided including a 40 K user file.

	Support is provided for the following UARTs and micros:

	8250     -   Heath H89/90/8, Zenith Z89/90
  	8251	 -   Intertec SuperBrain, DEC VT180
	Z80-SIO  -   Big Board, Xerox 820, Kaypro II, Micom 2001

The files are setup so the user can change baud rate, word length,
parity, and number of stop bits. The exception this is the VT180
which does not have the capability of baud rate setting under CPU
control.

The following is from the history file.

05/05/83  Revised program as follows:
	
	1. Corrected erroneous attempt to do multifile transfers
	   from command line,
	2. Put telephone number library in START.ASM and the tele-
	   phone library display routines in MAIN.ASM,
	3. Made minor changes in setup routine for H89,
	4. Added support for several new systems.
							P.L.Kelley

04/25/83  Revised program as follows:

	1. Combined MODEM796.ASM and MODEM796.LIB and divided the
	   resulting file into linked modules for use with the public
	   domain assembler, LASM. This has the following advantages:
		a. gives short, logically organized, easily edited
		   modules,
		b. minimal changes to a single module prior to assembly
		   should allow most users to generate a working
		   program for their system,
		c. avoids use of MAC, which some users may not own,
	2. Eliminated PMMI-only routines; this shortens the program
	   considerably and results in most of the modules being
	   system independent,
	3. Introduced standard locations in low memory for user
	   configurable tables and system dependent code,
	4. Used many of the non-PMMI routines in MDM700-707 (see below),
	5. Made the following enhancements,
		a. added toggle for sending/not sending end-of-file
		   marker in terminal mode text file output,
		b. added toggle for sending/not sending linefeed after
		   carriage return in terminal mode file output, this
		   allows use with either a mainframe or a micro which
		   is capturing the file,
		c. added toggle for waiting/not waiting until character
		   echoed in terminal mode file output,
		d. added separate menu for terminal mode file output
		   flow control commands,
		e. increased from 1 to 10 the number of user defined
		   strings which can be transmitted in terminal mode,
		   and added command for displaying list of strings
		   (thanks to E. O. Stork for this idea),
		f. added routines to reset word length, stop bits, and
		   parity to H89 baud rate resetting routine, and
		   included information on settings in current parameter
		   information screen; 7 bit text transfers are now 
		   possible. It should be relatively simple to modify
		   these routines for another computer,
		g. added routine to disconnect modem from telephone line
		   if computer and modem allow this,
		h. added routine to provide carrier detect status
		   information,
		i. added message on returning to terminal mode after
		   Q (quiet) file transfer.

	6. Used LU to put the ASM, DOC and HIS files together with LASM
	   and MLOAD into a LIB file with the name MODEM900.LBR. Skipped
	   the 8.xx version number sequence as that sequence has already
	   been used for a system specific version.

to find these words in the ZCPR2 documentation.  What I find is:

	All rights reserved

	According to my meager understanding of the copyright
laws, Rick has retained all rights (at least to the

The point that I was trying to get across in my earlier message was that
I felt that Workman's interests were not so much to help the general public
with the distribution of public domain software, but to put more money into
his pockets off the work done by others.  Is this kind of piracy any better
than stealing copies of CP/M, even though it's done with permission from
the author?  I feel that any distribution should be done through non-profit
organizations.

My other complaint was that this *was* a profit-making organization, and
advertisements as such shouldn't be announced via INFO-CPM.  Pournelle may
get away with this with BYTE, but I really don't want to see it here.

          016; 10 May 83 12:43:46 PDT (Tue)

First of all, I believe that you have a right to your opinions as
I  have  a  right to mine.  I'm not trying to change your opinion
(well, maybe I am), and I am writing this simply  to  express  my
feelings on the subject.

I don't classify what Workman is doing as piracy.  Piracy implies
that  legal  harm  is  being done, such as stealing from someone.
Stealing copies of CP/M is piracy since harm is being done to  DR
(in  the form of a loss of income that would be there if the pro-
duct was sold instead).  Selling PD software  isn't  causing  any
harm  that I can see.  I don't feel a loss of money because Work-
man is selling ZCPR2.

This does NOT  mean,  however,  that  I  approve  of  selling  PD
software.   I  don't feel that it is morally right to take advan-
tage of the generosity of others in this manner.  In the case  of
ZCPR2,  Workman asked me for permission and offered a percentage.
I granted the permission (rationale:  to  provide  a  source  for
those  who  were not successful or did not desire to tap into the
PD) but declined the percentage (rationale:  maintaining my  phi-
losophy  of  giving it away in the first place).  I don't believe
that Workman asked the other PD authors for permission (I know he
didn't  for  my  old  HELP system), and I believe this is morally
wrong, but I also believe he has the right to do this by the sim-
ple fact that it IS in the public domain.

As for advertising on this net, I agree completely that  this  is
wrong.  I don't believe, tho, that what Jerry did was advertising
(unless Jerry is getting a percentage of the sales, which I don't
think  he is).  If Workman came on and sent a message saying "I'm
selling so-and-so for $$$", then THAT would be advertising.   As-
suming  that  Workman  did not ask Jerry to make the announcement
and that Jerry was passing it on only for  information  purposes,
then  Jerry  used  the  net to pass on information of interest to
others, which is a big part of what the net is  for.   My  saying
that  Rolm's Ada Language System is to be validated by the end of
May or that the 68010 is on the market for $20 and here's what it
does is passing information, which is fine, and I don't call this
advertising since advertising has, as I feel, an  implication  of
profit to the person who passes the information in this case.

Note that, by the dictionary, simply making a  public  notice  is
advertising, so if advertising is to be banned from the ARPA Net,
we may as well shut down the electronic mailing lists now.

I couldn't get any info about prices or availability of the optional
processors, software or peripherals.

When I started asking questions about the machine the salesman stated
that this was a home computer, not an engineering computer or a business
computer and that technical questions were not meaningful in that context.

With 840K an 8088 and CP/M86 this could be a nice home computer.

If anyone has more info please send it along.

Subject:  NEC8023/Wordstar Hints (Some Success)

Well, I gave up trying to get Wordstar to use the proportional-width
font on the NEC8023.
I did, however, manage to get superscripts and subscripts.
The trick is to set line spacing to half normal, then send TWO linefeeds
at the end of each line.  The patches used are:
LOCATION	VALUES		COMMENTS
PSINIT:		04 1B 54 31 32	set line spacing to 12/144"
PSCRLF:		03 0D 0A 0A	send extra linefeed at end-of-line
PSHALF:		02 0D 0A	single linefeed gives half-vertical-space

I had tried this before and it didn't work, because I was not aware that
PSHALF: should include a carriage return.  Thanks to the compilers of

Subject: CP/M poll - what have you got?
Article-I.D.: uw-beave.576

I'm interested in finding out the relative percentages of various
machines supporting CP/M which are in existence.  In particular,
I'd like to know what sort of floppie formats will cover the most
number of machines.  If anyone knows of any marketing data I can
get my hands on, find.  Otherwise, I'd appreciate it if you would
take the time to answer a few brief questions about your system,
and any systems you know of belonging to others.

1.  Machine and model (Apple II, Apple III, Northstar Advantage, etc....)
2.  CP/M version number.
3.  Type of floppie (8" SSSD, 8"DDDD, 5-1/4" SSSD soft sector, etc.)
4.  Modem or communications program on system. (MDM???, etc.)

Hello!
	Two queries:

	First, I'm looking for the addres/phone# of Sofware Distributors
of Culver City, CA.  They supposedly have over 70 software packages for
the Rainbow.

	Second, I'm looking into data base systems for my Rainbow, but
for the most part, only CP/M-80 programs are available.  If anyone
has info on 8088 CP/M-86 data bases, I would really like to see it.
(Forward to the list and/or to me as you see it)

				Thanks in advance,

Apple  CP/M  (November  1980  version)  comes  with  a program to
transfer source files from a  DDOS  diskette  to  an  Apple  CP/M
diskette.

However, there is no program supplied to transfer text files from
an Apple CP/M diskette to a DOS diskette.  (I have DOS 3.3.)

Does anyone out there know of the existence of a  program  to  do
each of the following?

1)  Transfer  text  files from an Apple CP/M (56K) diskette to an
Apple DOS diskette.

2) Transfer text files from an Apple CP/M diskette (56K) to Apple
UCSD Pascal diskettes (16 sector) and vice versa

Please send me any information you may have on the above.

Thank you....Barbara Wagreich

Subject: Selling ZCPR2
To: info-cpm@brl.arpa

	I don't remember the name of the person, but someone wrote to the
net that they didn't like what Workman was doing, but was goig to purchase
from him anyway, because it is his only access to ZCPR2.  GARBAGE!!
SIG/M is selling the disks for $6 each and NYACC is selling the manuals
at $24 for the set!  The addresses follow:

	SIG/M User Group
	Amateur Computer Group of New Jersey, Inc
	Box 97
	Iselin, NJ 08830

	S-100, CP/M User Group
	NY Amateur Computer Club
	PO Box 106
	Church Street Station
	New York, NY 10080

>>  WRITE THESE ADDRESSES DOWN <<

	If only people would help others in this effort, less people would
get "ripped off" as some people think Workman is doing, and others will simply
have the freedom of choice to support the people they want to support (which
is what I think the case is).

	No, this is not an Advert for SIG/M and NYACC, it is to pass some
apparently little known information on to those people who need it.

	Now, since you have a source for the software, once you get it,
return the favor by helping sombody else!  Remeber, since ZCPR2 and related
software is Public Domain, you can get 15 people together to purchase it
from Workman or SIG/M and buy it ONCE, and then COPY it!  Just because somebody
is selling it, and you don't like it, doesn't mean you are not allowed to beat
the system.

i will be in the boston area sometime over the summer, and would like to
take back home with me all sorts of nifty stuff that is currently stored
on the MC CPM archives.  I would need the assistance of someone in the boston
area with a modem and 8 inch floppies who could do copying for me.  (boston
area is specified because i think it would be a hassle for this person to
do everything, and i would expect to help in any way i could.)

can anyone volunteer their services?  i would be willing then to act as

It is nice to publish the address of SIG/M, but getting a
response from them is almost impossible.  The software
coordinator for the San Diego Computer Society, a non-
profit type group with over 1K members, sent them a check
for $80 back in early March, and can not even get them
to acknowledge the order.

If Rick Conn is correct on the percentage of active members
in the group, then they need a lot more help.  Being the
central distribution point for something as big a Zcpr2 is
a lot of work, and I wouldn't be a bit surprised to find out
that they would appreciate any help that they can get. - Bob

If I were to decide to sell some of my software, I would probably make
it public domain.  The reason for this is that software piracy will 
occur (for good codes anyway) whether I copyright or not.  But by making 
my software public domain I am directly authorizing any 'piracy' that
anyone wants to do.  Of course, if you don't buy from me, you won't
get bugfixes, updates, or extensions when they are available.

This method of software marketing will only work if I price my code
reasonably.  No $600.00 compiler I have ever seen is worth the money, 
so people pirate copies instead.  I have written my own language processors
for my stuff (if I need something that didn't come with the hardware) and
I get along pretty good without the overpriced codes that are on the market.
Still, it would save a lot of time if I could buy this stuff at a reasonable
price.

An even better testing routine:

	inr	a
	jpo odd
	xor a
odd:ret

I might have the opcodes wrong (I work both 8080 and Z80, no manual around).
Point is: inr a will set odd parity on and 8080--but is not an overflow on
the z80. This routine sets the zero flag if it is a z80, I think...

Technical questions are ALWAYS relevant.  That's the trouble with most
microcomputer salesmen ... they always come up with some reason not to 
tell you the technical info you need to make a rational decision.  The
truth is that most of them don't have any technical background and just
don't know the answers to the important questions.  Send away to the
factory! It takes a while, but at least you can get some technical stuff.

Subject: Converting ITS format COM files
To: Info-Cpm@brl.arpa

If you can FTP COM files from MIT-MC but have been unable to
come up with a way to remove the four-byte ITS header, here's
good news!  I have written a program which will translate ANY
LENGTH  ITS-format COM file to standard CP/M format.  All you
need to do is get the file onto your CP/M system and then run
this program.  It's called ITSCVT, and the HEX version is available
as AR13:CPM;ITSCVT HEX.  The program allows ambiguous filenames
and prompts the operator as to whether the present file should
be translated, skipped, go continuous (don't ask anymore), or
quit.  It's a cousin of my COPYFILE version 1.5 program.

This program assumes that your mainframe MODEM (umodem,tmodem,
MODEM,XMODEM, etc) program pads the last sector to make it
an even 128 bytes (this is normal for those programs).  Because
of this padding, the ITS-format COM file will be one sector longer
than the original COM file.  This is because the 4-byte header
makes the file 4 bytes longer, of course.  ITSCVT.COM will take
this into consideration, omitting the last sector that was added
because of the padding.

The outfile files have the same name as the input, with a filetype
of .CPM.  They are written to the currently-logged (default)
drive.  The input files may be on any drive.

Source code for this program will not be available at this time,
but I will maintain it.  Bug reports/comments to me, please, or
if you can't remember my username, send them to Info-Cpm-Request@Brl.

Please remember that some versions of the mainframe MODEM programs
already know about ITS COM format file and strip the four bytes for you.
If yours does this, you don't need this program.

R2E appears to be getting out of there System X product line and cutting
down their expenses by closing up shop in Minnesota. I have recently
bought their main CPU board which contains a 4 MHZ Z80, 64K DYN RAM,
DMA, PIC. The only addition one must make is the disk controller. The
board contains 4 S100 slots and therefore this is not a problem. The
revision of the R2E board is REV H.  Anyone who has information board
layouts, schematics for this Rev..pls contact

		Dennis Weinstein
		8324 Kentucky Avenue
		Minneapolis,MN 55445.  I believe that most R2E's
shipped are at REV E and are delivered with schematics but no layouts.
Anyone who has this info or any other info reguarding the R2E pls write
or send mail to Weinstein -at HI-Multics.. thx in advanced

Subject:  ZCPR2 in the PD

        I had responded to Jay indirectly thru  Paul  Grupp  ear-
lier, so the rest of INFO-CPM did not see the reply.  Things have
changed since the reply, and I would like to answer the  question
for anyone else who is interested as well.

        ZCPR2 was NOT originally in the PD.  While I wanted it to
be  available  to everyone who wanted it, I also wanted to retain
some rights to it under the copyright laws.  I  read  a  document
(put  out  on the net earlier) on the subject, and concluded that
both goals would be met if ZCPR2 was released to  SIG/M  specifi-
cally.   Being  a  user  group that charged no membership fee and
that distributed its  software  to  anyone  who  wanted  it,  the
release  to  SIG/M  effectively,  but not formally, constituted a
release to the PD.  SIG/M however is NOT the PD, per se,  so,  in
theory  (my theory, that is), the copyright protection was in ef-
fect.  While I view SIG/M as being equated to the  PD,  SIG/M  is
the  Special  Interest  Group in Microcomputers of the ACG-NJ and
NOT the PD.  Note that on the SIG/M release form,  SIG/M's  right
to ZCPR2 is documented.

        I feel that this did provide the copyright  protection  I
desired,  but  I  never  had any intent to pursue enforcement.  I
just wanted to see if this would slow down or  stop  anyone  from
enterprising  on  ZCPR2,  and it didn't seem to make much differ-
ence.  That's OK, tho, because I don't feel I was being  hurt  by
it,  and  the only ones who may be are those who buy it and later
find out that they could have had it for free.   The  old  CAVEAT
EMPTOR philosophy.

        June's Microsystems contains an article on ZCPR2 which  I
wrote,  and,  along with helping to educate the user community on
the existance of ZCPR2, it announces ZCPR2 as being in the Public
Domain  (as opposed to SIG/M).  I believe that this public state-
ment constitutes a formal release to the public domain,  and  the
full intent of the original release of ZCPR2 is realized.  Anyone
who was held back by the copyright notice  in  the  ZCPR2  source
codes  (IF  anyone  was) can now proceed and quote the article if
they need support.

        I think you can  see  what  the  experiment  showed  (NOT
proved).   I  still encourage the use of ZCPR2, and I now view it
as being formally released to the PD with any lack of  protection
that  may  accompany  such  release.  The bottom line, I feel, is
that the interests of the public are served, and was the original
intent  with the release to SIG/M.  The difference is that no one
should find them restricted wrt ZCPR2 use in any way.

Has  anybody  out  there  had  trouble  with the GET statement to
retrieve random access records in the November  1980  version  of
Apple  CP/M MIcrosoft Basic (put out by Microsoft)?  I seem to be
having trouble getting it towork properly for me and wondered  if
anyone  has  had trouble (or success) with it?  The PUT statement
seemstowork as far as I can tell but when I  GET  a  record,  the
numeric  values  are  strange  (even  with  CVI).   If there is a
problem with the GET statement, is there any way toget around the
problem?

Thanks for whatever information you cangive me.

Barbara, this is the second time that you've referred to the Nov-80 version
of Microsoft Apple CP/M.  You may have version 2.20, in which there were
pretty definitely bugs with random I/O.  Microsoft has since gone to version
2.23 which has corrected all known problems with random I/O.

In addition to correcting a lot of niggling bugs, they folded the CCP into
the second 4K bank of the language card, allowing a 60K configuration of
CP/M.  Unfortunately, all non-DR programs that know about the CCP too well
(the latest version of BDS C being a prime example--Leor take note!) don't
work with the 60K configuration, forcing you to stick with the 56K
configuration.

You should be able to get an update from Microsoft by sending in your
original disks with $7.50.  You might call first to make sure that
they haven't raised the fee or done something nasty like shut the window
on updates (I wouldn't put it past them--I've gotten the impression
from talking to them that they aren't too friendly to customers).

I am having trouble getting MDM901 to work on my system.  I un-LU'ed

worked fine; no errors.  However, MLOAD gave me the following output:

MLOAD ver 1.1   Copyright (C) 1983 Ronald G. Fowler

Loaded 0 bytes (0000H - 495 records) to file .COM

++ Warning: program origin NOT at 100H ++

I tried using MLOAD 1.3 (which did not come with MDM901), but that
gave the same errors.  

The only thing I have changed in the files is START.ASM (the logon
strings, and one or two other EQU's) and SYS.ASM (renamed 8250SYS.ASM
to SYS.ASM and changed minor EQU's).

Does anyone know what is wrong??

I recently received the Godbout CPUZ in the mail and after reading the docs. I've

high order address lines) will switch the whole 64K out to another.  My question
is that if all 64K are out where does the next instruction come from?? I assume it
comes from the new bank but how do I get it there in the first place.  This seems
to be another dog chasing it's own tail routine.  It isn't obvious to me how to use
this facility.  Anybody who knows how to do this or how this board works -
PLEASE message me.  Thanks.

Subject:  Silicon vs. Silicone

Well, I cannot remain silent any longer - as a chemist by training (and a
microcomputer hacker by preference) I must once and for all call for a
halt to the interchangeable use of the words SILICON and SILICONE.

Silicon, as in Silicon valley, is an element, atomic number 14, atomic
weight 28. Silicon is a basic ingredient in sand, 8085's and the like.

Silicone, as in Raquel Welch, is a generic term for a number of synthetic
fats, oils and greases in which some of the carbon atoms are replaced by
silicon.

Please note these are not the same animal and should not be used inter-
changeably - it upsets the digestion1

integrate both the HEX file for ZCPR2 and the HEX file for this patch

	I have found in not only neccassary, but very convienient to
library many files on my RCP/M disks.  Many people do not always recognize
certain files as being in a package due to non-standard naming conventions,
so a library groups the files and people can easily tell that all the files
are related.  Also, by librarying files I can save directory space which
is limited to 64 entries on my system.  The side effect of librarying files
is very large files which could take hours to download at 300 baud.  The
solution is to only allow members of the libraries to be downloaded, and
not the whole library.  One prevents a file from being downloaded by
"tagging" the high bit on the first byte of the file name, and xmodem
will not send that file.  The way XMODEM74 has been written, it will not
allow this file to be accessed by any means.  I wanted XMODEM74 to access
this file IF the user was using the "L" option in xmodem.  The following
patch will allow xmodem to send members from a library file, but will not
allow sending of the entire .LBR file.

OPENOT:
	lda	optsav
	cpi	'L'
	jz	openok2

Find the label OPENOT: in XMODEM74.ASM and insert directly after the
label the three lines shown in lower case.

Two 6502-related programs, which run under CP/M, are available in
the MIT-MC CPM; directory.

AR74:CPM;6502 SIMLBR - By Ron Fowler, 6502SIM is an adaptation
of ZX65 published by Dr. Dobb's Journal in August 1981.  The
original program (ZX65) was by R.M. Kruse.  As distributed,
ZX65 was difficult to bring up.  Ron has made major modificiations
and now presents us with a workable 6502 Simulator program.

to extract the files from this "LBR" after downloading to your system.

AR74:CPM;6DASM MAC and D6502 MAC - By Richard Conn and W.F. Dudley,
this is a variation of Richard Conn's DASM disassembler, with mods for 
6502 disassembly.  Apple Users with CP/M, you might find this useful,
as will anyone trying to disassemble 6502 code.

Re:   How to use Mem. mapping.

  The solution almost universally employed is to set up a chunk of
memory as "global" -- ie, it responds only to the low 16 address
lines, ignoring the extended lines, and therefore always "on".

The size of this global memory depends on the application -- it may
be small enough only to hold an inter-bank communication routine,
or (as in the case of a banked MP/M system, for example) may be
as large as 16K, 20K or more.		--Ron Fowler

OOPS.  You will note that there is a 4k block of memory on that card, I believe.
If so, you may place the memory management code in that block and option it as
"global" ram, i.e., it will reside in *each* 64k page.  If I am wrong you will need
another card (surprise!) such as Godbout's System Support 1, which I *know* has
4k of ram which can be made global.  Note that using a block of global ram
means that you may have to option all your memory cards to have those
addresses permanently in tri-state, i. e., disabled, in order to avoid bus
contention.  This would definitely be true using the System Support 1, but may
not be the case if the CPU has the ram on-board; the CPU's internal address logic
may allow you to switch this block in and out of memory on yet another port
and then disable the data-in buffers on the card while reading the on-board
memory; this effectively gives the on-board ram precedence when switched in. 
Take a long look at your owner's manual. 

A second alternative *does* exist, although it is extremely clumsy & may require
hardware hacks (risky ones at that on your new toy; can void the warranty). 
Which board in your system handles boot-strap?  If another card in the system,
such as the disk controller has this job, you are sunk.  The CPU, since it
contains the port which handles the bank switching, *must* bootstrap the
system.  Reason is, the only other way to handle the vanishing code trick is to
have code in *every* bank in the system, at the same location, which picks up
the program and handles entry once the bank switch has been accomplished. 
This in turn requires, that the memory be initialized from a boot rom which has
instructions to transfer said code into a 64k bank, switch to the next bank, and
repeat the operation until all banks have been initialized.  To do this, the rom
must be the only *readable* memory in the system, at least until the boot
operation is complete.  This is easiest done by the CPU hardware itself, in much
the same manner as described above.  Basically, at cold boot, the hardware sets a
latch which disables the data-in buffers on the s-100 bus for all memory reads
when the rom is selected and concurrently allows ony the card's internal data
bus to be read.  The data-out buffers are still functional, memory external to the
CPU is now "write-only" (no kidding) until some point after the bank
initialization when the rom program unsets the latch holding the data-n buffers
in tri-state. This latter can lead to the same problem if the last code address
executed from the rom is not physically contiguous with the first insrtuction
executed from ram after the latch unset.  This is beacause the latch unset, will,
most other designs (JADE{ugh!} or QT), deselect the rom.  

Confused? stick with 64k & use ZCPR2; bank switching is a poor substitute for
real memory management.  Good luck.

I have converted Richard Conn's ZCPR2 version 0.3 to 8080 code exclusively
in anticipated arrival of my Godbout 8085/88 board. ZCPR2 is simply
too good to abandon and I strongly recommend those of you who are running
8080 CPU's to check out the files on AR85:CPM on the MIT-MC machine.

There is a short explanatory doc file explaining the changes and the
different installation requirements conversion necessitated, the CCP
replacement itself, and several utilities of Rick's that are also
converted from Z80. The balance of the ZCPR2 utilities will run on
an 8080 as released.

Bug reports to me at MIT-MC or on Compuserve's CP-MIG. The next step
is a ZCPR-like CCP for CP/M-86???

In-reply-to: Msg of 16 May 83 15:11 EDT () from Thieret.WBST at parc-maxc.arpa

The Godbout CPU-Z has a switch for setting the ON-BOARD memory to
"base page only" OR "global".  When S3 position 6 is OFF, the memory
on the CPU board will be used in PLACE of memory in ANY bank that
is selected.  The 4K of CPU memory can be RAM, ROM, or 2K of each.
Just be sure that not only in the code to switch banks in the "global"
memory but also the the stack pointer MUST be set to "global" RAM if
you do any CALLs, PUSHes, or anything else that tries to use the stack
while an extended bank is selected (out of BASE page).

This is a great feature of this board as many of todays higher density
memory boards don't allow for deselection of a "window" to make way
for "global" memory.  The only draw back is that any board OTHER than
the CPU-Z that address this memory window will get the MAIN memory
board and not the CPU-Z's memory.  This means that DMA is NOT possible
to this global spot of memory but will work in the rest of the address
space.

cc: WESTFALL.HENR@parc-maxc.arpa

Someone recently was looking for some info on the 6509 cpu. The 82-83
data book by MOS tech ( a commodore company) has this to say about the
chip.
 (Product preview)

o  1 megabyte addressing
o  3 state 16 bit address bus allowing dma and multiprocessor systems
sharing a common memory while the 4 bit extended address register allows
for up to 1 megabyte of data- storage
o  internal architecture is identical to the 6502 to provide software
compatiblilty

Features of the 6509
o  memory management
o  on board clock logic
o  addressable memory rage to 1 mbyte
o  single +5 supply
o  n channel, silicon gate, depletion load technology
o  8 bit parallel processing
o  56 instructions
o  decimal and binary instructions
o  13 addressing modes
o  true indexing capability
o  programmable stack pointer
o  variable length stack
o  interrupt capability
o  8 bit bi-directional data bus
o  Program accessable memory range of up to 65k bytes
o  Direct memory access capability
o  bus compatable with 6800
o  pipeline architecture
o  1 ,2 or 3 mhz operation
o  use with and type or speed memory

The info I have is just one page in the data book, however I did notice
a few things ( they include a pin out of the chip- but no pin
descriptions)

	40 pin package
	pins are as follows:
	ready, irq/, sync, nmi/, aec, Vdd, a0-a15, Vss, p0-p3,s.o., d0-d7,
r/w, o2 out, reset, o0 in

	the p0-p3 lines appear to be the high 4 bits on the address, making
this a bank select type machine.
The chip looks interesting, however they don't say if those 4 high bits
will tristate along with the 16 address bits

I found some more information on the Super Z-89 board described in
<1435@sri-arpa.UUCP>.  I have included that information as well.

HARDWARE
--------
a.  Plug in replacement for h89/z89 cpu. (NO modifications required)
b.  DUAL cpus! (z80 and 8086) **** NOT 8085 as in Z-100; youe z80 prgs work!!
c.  128K ram standard, with sockets for 256K.  memory bus for expansion to 1meg
d.  5 i/o slots
e.  2/4 mhz z80 speed, 8mhz for 8086 (Z-100 and IBMPC are ~ 5 mHz 8088)
f.  FULLY compatible with ALL heath/zenith peripherals incl most ROMS
g.  $1495, 8 weeks devlivery as of May 20 1983
h.  Uses same amount of power as Z89 CPU board
i.  Claimed slightly less RFI than stock Z89.  FCC-wise, may be illegal to
    sell but not to own.

SOFTWARE
--------
a.  runs all heath/zenith software with no mods
b.  fully compatible with h/z100 (which makes it IBM compatible too.)
c.  choice of MS-DOS or CP/M-86 for the 8086 #
d.  supplied with diagnostic software package
e.  "soft disk" feature allows for using ram as virtual disk.
f.  supports multi-user/multi-tasking operating systems.
g.  CDR systems is adapting system for their disk controller boards.


Z-100 programs that directly refrence the hardware may not work -CAF

Richard Fitzgerald <jazzy@aerospace.arpa (Richard Fitzgerald)>:
Now, I have seen this system perform, and it is quite nice.

Marc Brooks (CDR systems) likes the board except for the i/o pins
(that mount the i/o cards) which are too short and not gold plated.

According to Rumor Control, Microsoft is unwilling to sell MS-DOS to TMS
because TMS is advertising CP/M-86 also.

I just purchased a used TeleVideo 801 computer.  Unfortunately, the copy
of CP/M enclosed with it had a corrupted file system.  Does anyone
in the San Francisco Bay Area have a TVI801 or know of someone who does?
Dealer references would also do.  If necessary, I will go through the 
TeleVideo channels, but that will take quite some time and I would
like to install this machine as soon as possible.  I need a new
copy of CP/M for this machine.  I have the original, serialized dist
disk from TeleVideo as well as all the registration stuff, so my need
is simply a matter of getting a good copy.  Any suggestions would
be appreciated.

To: info-cpm@brl.arpa

I have been using VEDIT with an H19 terminal and like
the ability to define/use the special keys. I also like
the ability to insert any character (except Ctl-Z) into 
a file. Does MINCE allow custom keybord configuring, or use
special keys on pre-defined terminals? What about Ctl character
insert? I have seen MINCE advertised at $139, so I am thinking
about trying it. Anyone able to give a first hand comparison
of MINCE and VEDIT?

RAMDRIV5 has worked just fine for myself and a number of others I have
given the program to. I have used the internal buffers without a
hitch. Sorry I cannot give you any further help. Above all, don't
waste your money on Cache/Q. It requires much more memory than a ram
driver to give decent results.
I am converting to an 8085/88 system so will soon have to give up my
ram drive. This is the only real unpleasant part of the conversion
process (unless I run into any gotchas).

Subject: dBase II / KAYPRO II Problem
 
A local friend needs help in getting dBase II to run
right on his KAYPRO II.
 
The problem:  When appending (or editing) a record,
the cursor is two positions to the left of where it should
be.  The inserting/editing of data takes place where it
should, but the operator cannot easily tell what he is doing.
 
Installation is according to instructions (KAYPRO II simulates
ADM-3A Terminal).  All other functions seem OK.  Experimentation
with installation protocol has not solved problem.
 
If someone has solved this problem, will appreciate a note
with advice that I can pass on.
 
Please send response direct to:  STORK%MIT-MC

Subject:  New HELP2 for ZCPR2

AR81, 82, and 84 of CPM contain new HELP2 files  --  source,  ob-
ject, and HLP.  CRCs check.

Significant among the changes is the ability  to  print  (on  the
LST:  device) your current screen display or information section.
This is really nice for a range of applications I  had  not  con-
sidered before.  Thanks to Carolyn Carter for the idea.

All new documentation is in the HLP file.  The following  summar-
izes the concepts surrounding the new Print capability:

:HELP: Printing HELP Files
     Printing  HELP  Files  can be done in two basic  ways  -- by
using  the PHELP Utility of ZCPR2 or by using the Print  function
contained within the HELP Utility itself.

     The PHELP Utility is used to print an entire Help File.   It
acts  a  lot like the PRINT3,  and it has a variety  of  options,
including  the ability to plan for printer output and to  support
paging and other "appearance-enhancing" features.

     The Print Function within HELP is used for quick  printouts.
It  does  not  page or perform anything more exotic  than  simply
printing  out what is contained in a part of a Help  File.   When
the P option is given,  the user is asked to set the top of  form
(giving him time to turn on his printer) and then specify whether
he  wants  to  print the current Frame (Screen  Display)  or  the
entire  information  section  which he is  currently  in.   After
selecting  one of these two options (the option to abort is  also
given),  the  printout  occurs  (may be aborted at  any  time  by
striking a ^C).   When finished, the user is returned to the last
frame he was viewing.

     This new Print Function (available in Versions 4.1 and later
of  HELP2) is provided as a fundamental convenience to the  user.
It allows the user to review the Help File,  and,  when he sees a
particular screen display or information section which he  values
enough  to  want to have around for future reference in  hardcopy
form,  he can simply tell HELP2 to print it.   This capability is
intended  to support the concept of establishing HLP files  as  a
convenient  and flexible way to pass documentation of programs to
the  user  on disk while simultaneously allowing  him  to  easily
print it out if it is of significant interest to him.


     For  instance,  a HLP file which refers to a new program may
contain  an  Information Section or one Frame  which  contains  a
command  summary.   The user can simply print this without having
the print the entire HLP file.

     As  another example,  the HELP2 subsystem may be used  by  a
homemaker  to  keep  her recipes on.   Organized using  the  tree
structure into reasonable catagories (such as  roasts,  desserts,
etc),  while reviewing the recipes she may find one she wishes to
try  for  the evening's meal or to pass on to a friend.   If  the
recipes covers only one screen, a Frame Print is very convenient.

RAMDRV5 (and it's predecessors) have two fatal bugs.  1. If your system
uses interrupts and an attempt is made to service one while NOT in the
base page of memory a crash will result as the pointers are kept in the
base page.  2.  If your total GLOBAL memory is greater than 256K the
DPH will be incorrect...  I am currently working with Herbert Shore
(the original author) on a new and MUCH improved version of this
program (to be named XDRIVE) which should be ready for release in about
a week.  (Free for NON-COMMERCIAL USE of course)

If you really want total keyboard configuration and a VAST HOST of other
valuable features in a Word Processor... look into The FinalWord from Mark of
the Unicorn.  I recently received it and I am REALLY IMPRESSED with all the
features - some things which I never thought of in terms of a text processor. 
Unicorn even has an ARPANET address for TECHNICAL questions.  Fantastic
support!!!  Fantastic software!!!!

	Can anybody offer assistance to some of us out here that can't access
the MIT cpm files?  I'd certainly appreciate if I could find a connection that
could 'uucp' (or 'usend') us some of the files I see being announced here.
I'd particularly like to get a hold of ZCPR2.

	Please respond by mail, and we an set things up.

Keith Petersen has place the list of SIG/M distribution points on
Mit-mc in "AR10:CPM;SIG-M DIST", so if you did not get a good
copy, you can FTP it from there.  For those who cannot FTP files,
you can send a note to INFO-CPM-REQUEST asking to have it net-mailed.

I have noted a few quirks running some PD software (like SQ,USQ)
in which, although the files are acted upon, the system does not
return (it apperars to hang, requiring a RESET). Anyone have info
on other software quirks, fixes. Has anyone successfully installed
ZCPR1 or ZCPR2 on the Apple CP/M system?

Subject:  Re:  Toolbox for ZCPR2

It seems like a valid position to me.  Ideas should be free.

There is already an IF...ELSE...ENDIF processor in the PD.
You may look at the source code if you wish.

The toolset/toolbox/integrated utility concept is fundamental to
ZCPR2.  That is a lot of what it was intended to be in the first
place, and feel perfectly free to expand the idea.  One thing you
may wish to take a look at is TEMPLATE.MAC.  This the a "template"
I designed for all future ZCPR2 utilities to be patterned from.
Among other things, it ensures interoperability within the system
and greatly simplifies the interface problems.  If you study TEMPLATE.MAC
and then study PRINT3 and PAGE sources, you will see how much work
is saved by patterning utilities around TEMPLATE.

I am CCing this to INFO-CPM for general info purposes also.

being new to my CP/M system, i must do some stupid things at first.
therefore, i accidentally turned off the power to my system while
a file was open.  (actually, this happened during an editing session
with MINCE - I don't know if it was swapping at the time).  I now
get the following nonsense which I don't understand.  When I do a
DIR, the directory prints out as it should.  when I do a TYPE FOO.*,
(where FOO.SUB was the file that MINCE was editing for me), I get
a BDOS error Illegal ??? in FCB and on the next line, BDOS function 15.
Apparently, Function 15 has to do with opening the file, but at this point
I get lost.  EVERYTHING ELSE seems to be working....

help??  many thanks.   Lin@mit-mc or g.cornella=c4f@ucb-arpa

Subject: ZCPR2 vs. other CCP replacements
To: info-cpm@brl

	While I have not encountered POWER yet, I can say that ZCPR2 is
very good competition for Micro Shell version 2.0.  A friend of mine with
an 8085 has not been able to use ZCPR2 (until CSTROM's conversion) on his
system, so he has been vary loyal to MicroShell.  In seeing wha he can do
(and listening to his sales pitches) I have come to the conclusion that
MicroShell has two features that ZCPR2 does not.  These are 1) previous
command editting -- if you make a mistake you can simply edit what you
typed with siply WordStar like commands; and 2) Pipes -- which as far
as I can tell only the author of MicroShell ever uses.  With ZCPR2 implemented
to its full capability one can obtain I/O redirection (and one doesn't even
need ZCPR2 for that, just follow Rick's scheme for the most part) and the
ato-execution of a .SUB file (or a file from a .LBR file, which MS won't do)
and ZCPR2 will even search more drives for a program name.  I am sure
that I have missed something for both ZCPR2 and MS, but these are the things
that I have picked up from everyday use.  In conclusion, save your $200 that
you would spend on MS, and spend a smaller portion of that obtaining ZCPR2.

From: fylstra.tsca@sri-unix
Received: from SRI-Tsca.micom by SRI-TSC.micom with rs232; 28 May 83 13:52-PDT

Here is a product idea for those of you with infinite spare time.
Now that VIC-20's and Atari-400's are down to $80 at your local
drug store, I would like to use one as a color graphics display
device (and possibly terminal) for my S-100 CP/M system.  Here is
a description of the ideal product (Atari version):

A PC board that plugs into the Atari 400/800 bus.  Contains one or
two 2716 EPROM sockets, a UART with baud rate generator, suitable
decoding, and RS-232 level convertors.  A ribbon cable brings the
RS-232 signals outside to a DB-25 connector.  Power-on reset jumps
into the EPROM.  The EPROM contains firmware to emulate a color
graphics terminal.  In addition to standard terminal functions
(printable characters, CR, LF, BS, clear screen, etc), escape
sequences would be used to select display mode (resolution/color
set); draw dots, lines, circles; fill in polygons; etc.
A reasonable candidate for the command language would be the
Tektronix 4010 terminal.  It should also have the capability of
up/downloading an entire screen image verbatim.  While we're at
it, let's add the capability to examine/deposit any arbitrary
region of memory, set processor registers, and start execution.
Another nice feature would be the ability to define "display
macros," each consisting of a variable-length string of the
graphics primitives, which could then be invoked by transmitting
the macro code.

I've always wanted a color graphics display capability for my
S-100 system.  It would be handy to have an additional terminal
(even with 40-column display width) available for testing purposes.
It should be possible to brew this design for less than $100 in
parts.  Anyone interested?

Subject: MODEM overlay problem solved
To: Info-Cpm@brl

Some users of the Kaypro, Xerox-820 and Televideo overlays for
MDM70x and other MODEM7 programs have reported problems getting
it to work.  This has finally been tracked down to the serial
port initialization routine used in the user customization
overlay.  It's not a bug - rather it's a matter of how the
hardware itself is used by the user.  The Z80 SIO chip has
a thing called "auto-enables" which can be turned on or off
at initialization time.  When it's turned on, the Z80 SIO
looks for several signals from the modem, including Data
Carrier Detect.  That's fine IF you hooked up the wires in
your RS-232 cable and IF your modem supplies these additional
signals (or you add jumpers to fake them).

It turns out that the people who had the problems has used only
pins 2, 3 and 7 of the RS-232 which is all you really need for
send, receive and ground.  However, the auto-enables must be
TURNED OFF in order for the Z80 SIO to function in this
environment.

In the initialization routine look for the code that does
MVI  A,0E1H  and then outputs that to the SIO chip.  That is
the proper byte for auto-enables ON, but it should be changed
to  MVI  A,0C1H  for auto-enables OFF.

Let's be logical about this - we have never heard (and never will hear) about
someone being sued for making 20 copies of a commercial program to store
away "just in case"... It seems to me that licensing agreements notwithstanding
there is little doubt what constitutes software piracy.

Uncopyable software is a function of the hardware - there is no such thing
in the CP/M world, for example. Another good reason not to buy an Apple!
I for one refuse to be at the mercy of the dealer to depend on for the
replacement of a damaged disk (which will always follow Murphy's law) and
do not want the taint of piracy on me just because I feel that I should have
a right to make a reasonable number of backup copies (and only I can determine
what reasonable means) of some software upon which my bread and butter may
depend!

It appears the files set up to install the ZCPR2 onto 60k Apple CP/M

where it worked fine, then moved it to the IIe, where it trashed
the screen and crashed. Seems the 80 col card uses the TEXT screen1
in addition to its own memory. So be aware, you will have to
find a new home for the ZCPR2 external buffers, or omit them.

Subject: Results of CP/M system survey
Article-I.D.: uw-beave.643

Descriptions  for  120  8-bit systems running CP/M were received.
Only a few replies stating use  of  CP/M-86  were  received,  and
these systems have not been counted.  A few comments are in order
before giving the quantitative results.

First,  a  single  site  reported  using  25 Altos 8000 machines.
Another site reported using "several" Altos machines as well, and
I choose the number 7 as being more than a few, less than a  lot,
and  capable of being stored in a nibble.  These were included in
the reports as 32 separate systems, and each entry which might be
affected  by  such  a  large  block  has  been  marked  with   an
asterisk(*).

Second,  many  systems  had different types of floppie drives and
more than  one  communications  software  package.   The  results
posted  are for system combinations; i.e., if a single system had
both  8"  and  5-1/4"  floppies,  then  it  was  counted  in  two
categories    for   question   three.    Systems   with   several
communications  programs  were  similarly  counted   in   several
categories.   As  a result, there were a total of 132 CPU/floppie
categories and 141 machine/software categories.

Finally,  floppie  drives  reported  to  be  switchable have been
included at their highest performance.  For example, my 8" drives
are single/double density, single/double sided;  they  have  been
recorded  in  the 8" DS DD category.  It is my understanding that
most drives can accept a lower density and fewer sides  than  the
maximum  capacity  reported.   No  non-standard  8"  formats were
reported; the number of 5-1/4" formats is, of course,  known  but
to God.

I.  What kind of machine do you have?

Subject: New version of MLOAD
To: INFO-CPM@mit-mc

My multi-file loader program, MLOAD, has been updated as of today.
Relevant files may be found on MIT-MC as follows:

		AR17:CPM;MLOAD 14ASM
		AR17:CPM;MLOAD 14HEX
		AR17:CPM;MLOAD 14COM

A major problem has been repaired with non-default drive loading,
and a couple of minor enhancements were added (See modification hi-
tory at the beginning of the ASM file for more details).

Thanks to CSTROM@MC and W8SDZ@MC for reporting the bug (and
both on the same day, no less!).		--Ron Fowler

Hopefully those "rental" companies you mention will soon be put out of
business by the softwre houses - they clearly violate license agreements
limiting usage to ONE machine. Their purpose is clearly to assist in
piracy while making bucks for themselves.

Subject: user areas on CPM 2.2 and MPM...

If a file is marked SYSTEM on MP/M (or presumably CP/M 2.2), and
you are in user area 1-15, is it possible to write to it? or do all
system files accessible to random user areas have a R/O attribute,
regardless of what the RW/RO status is on user area 0?

replies to G.cornella=c4f@ucb-arpa or lin@mit-mc

thanks.

Subject: Aztec C is good stuff
To: tektronix!info-cpm@brl
Via:  TEKTRONIX; 31 May 83 23:15-PDT

Aztec C is good stuff, and I speak as an experienced programmer.
I used their Z80 compiler to write a Business Basic compiler, with heavy
use of static data structures and initializers (for those lex and parse
tables).  They advertise that they implement everything except bit fields.
I've had some trouble with #if, and "solved" it by going exclusively with
#ifdef, but that was several versions ago.

My sole complaint is that their interface to MACRO-80 is not as good as
they advertise.  You pretty much have to invest a weekend in rebuilding
the L80 compatible library because they can't get it right themselves.
Fortunately the source code for all library routines is provided so this
is within the realm of possibility.
