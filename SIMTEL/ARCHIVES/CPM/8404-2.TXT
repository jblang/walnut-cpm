Subject: Update of MDM7xx overlay list

Dennis Recla has just released an updated list of all overlays known
to him.  We don't have all these at SIMTEL20, but if you need one we
don't have you can call the numbers listed at the end of his list.

If you find it necessary to do this I would appreciate it very much if
you would attempt to get the file to me via netmail or FTP (contact me
first for instructions on where to send it).

The overlay file on the left is the prefered version for the various MDM7
overlays.  Usually the difference means the the SET command is active and
will allow for changing the Baud rate from the modem program and not have
to use an external 'SETUP' programs.

Be sure that when you use DDT to overlay the proper HEX file on the various
MDM7xx.COM programs that you SAVE the proper amount of Memory to the .COM
file.  As MDM7xx has grown the SAVE size has also increased, so don't use
the SAVE size in the overlay unless you are using it on the the identified
MDM7xx program.

Good luck with your overlay..

If there are any NEW computer or S-100 board MDM7xx overlays not on this
list please upload them to Dave Crane's RCP/M (214-931-8274) or to the
Technical CBBS (313-846-6127) for inclusion in this list or contact me
on my up and down RCP/M at (214-681-4789; always 300 but usually 300/1200)

PHIL,

REGRETTABLY, I SUSPECT THAT BIOS WILL BE COPYRIGHTED.  I KNOW THE ONE
FOR MY MORROW IS COPYRIGHTED BY MORROW, BUT LUCKILY MORROW PROVIDED THE

SOURCE CODE FOR MINE, SO HACKING IS A (RELATIVE) JOY.  NEVER SAW SOURCE
FOR THE APPLE CP/M BIOS FROM ANYONE.

ON TWO OF THE SYSTEMS I WORKED ON (ONE WITH A SANTA CLARA HARD DISK, AND
THE ONE I'M ON (TEMPORARILY) RIGHT NOW, CPM56.COM WAS PROVIDED WITH THE
SYSTEM DISK.  THAT OF COURSE INCLUDED THE APPROPRIATE BIOS, BUT AS PART
OF CP/M ITSELF.  I DID START DISASSEMBLING THE ONE FOR THE SANTA CLARA,
AND MANAGED SOME TOAD HALL PATCHES, BUT NO FUN!

REGRETS, BUT I DON'T THINK I SHOULD TRY TO UPLOAD WHAT I DO HAVE.
PROBABLY ILLEGAL, AND THE HARD DISK BIOS WILL BE TOTALLY WRONG FOR YOU
ANYWAY.

Subject: Collection Conversions Complete

The conversions of MICRO:<PC-BLUE.*>, MICRO:<CPMUG.*>, and
MICRO:<SIGM.*> are now complete.  Files with a generation number of .2
are ASCII files, while those with .1 remain ITS-Binary files.

Some files with apparent ASCII filetype names, such as, .BAS, .ASM,
.DOC, and others, were not converted because a high-bit was detected or
there were more than 40% control characters before the first ^Z (the
CP/M EOF for ASCII files).  The most likely reason is that such files
were created or edited using WordStar in Document mode.  There will be
no further conversions attempted on such files.

Each of the above directories now contains an up-to-date .CRCLST file
which indicates which files are "COM" (ITS-Binary) and which are ASCII
files.

For those interested in such things, the total disk space recovered
was 3,708 pages or about 12%.  Not quite as much as I had hoped, but
every page counts.

I frankly do not recall there being a public domain footnoter out
there. I have seen a proprietary product called, strangely enough,
Footnote (by Pro/Tem Software in Ca.), and I have seen an index
generator for WordStar in the public domain, but that is about it.
Of course, I could be wrong...

Sorry you had problems HEXIFYing COM files after FTPing from SIMTEL20.
Make sure your TOPS-20 host has the very latest HEXIFY.  It was just
recently updated to include longer file names, wild cards, and
recognition of ITS-Binary headers (which it throws away before making
the .COM file).  It's available from SIMTEL20's <CPM.TOPS-20>
directory.

Extracted from:		     FTNOTE.DOC
			     ----------
		    Documentation for FTNOTE.COM
			(C)1984,  Eric Meyer
		      (Version 1.2 - 84/04/25)

VERSION HISTORY:
     This program has been much improved since I first wrote it,
largely in responce to user feedback (see below).  In case you run
across an earlier version on some BBS, here is a brief explanation
of its evolution.  Your earlier document files ARE upward compatible.
   84/03/29    FTNOTE 1.0   8K
     The basic program, with "formatting" mode only.  Options
allow numbering and print mode control.  Requires the user to
write a separate file of notes.  Offers .FB figure block command.
   84/04/09    FTNOTE 1.1   10K
     Added "-e" and "-r" modes: note texts can be entered in
the document, immediately following the "[##]" call, making
writing (and editing) easier.  Added the .FN dot command.
   84/04/25    FTNOTE 1.2   12K
     Note entry no longer requires breaking up the text line;
notes can be entered en bloc at paragraph bottom.
     Added "-n" mode, providing automatic numbering of notes in
DOC and NOT files separately, for folks who want end notes.
     Dot commands .LS and .PL are now allowed; and page numbers
displayed reflect the .PN command if used.  "-e" won't run if note
file already exists, for added safety.	You can now vary the dashed
line at page bottom.  Notes can print up with text on short pages.

FEEDBACK:
     If you think you have found a bug in this program, or have some
suggestions for improving it, please contact:
	  Eric Meyer, 427 N. Washington, Bloomington, IN 47401.
	  Phone (812)332-5018, CompuServe [74415,1305].

Charlie,

I just checked out the copy I had in my directory -- it's FOOTNOTE.COM Ver 1.0
1984 by E. Meyer.  Don't remember WHERE I found the thing -- but for sure out
there in NetLand somewhere in public domain (I don't pirate).  No .ASM here
(which is strange since I seldom download pure .COM files - love to learn from
the source code too much for that!) -- hope I'm not violating anyone's real
copyright!

Still will check out the new FTNOTE at SIMTEL20 though.

Thanks,
David Kirschbaum

Subject: RBBS 4.1 Edit 01 Available

Subject files are now available in MICRO:<CPM.RBBS4> on SIMTEL20.  Get
RBBS4101.LBR if you need the whole works, else get *.*.4101 for just
the changed files.  The first screenful of RBBS4.HIS.4101 enumerates
the bug fixes and features changed or added in this version.

RBBS4 is a Remote Bulletin Board System written in BDS-C and is very
loosely based on the MBASIC version, RBBS31.  It is mainly of interest
to RCP/M Sysops and perhaps others.

I have been asked by several people if anyone has converted this
program to another C dialect suitable for use with MSDOS or CP/M-86.
If you know of such a version, or of a conversion in progress, please
let me know via net mail.  I believe it should run pretty much as-is
for MP/M-80 as it was originally designed to (and still does) run
under TurboDOS.
