I have uploaded the following file to SIMTEL20:

pd2:<cpm.arc-lbr>
CL10.LBR	LBR-file 'compacting' utility

CL is a highly enhanced version of a utility created by Michal 
Carson in early 1989.  Its main function is to "compact" an LBR 
file, that is, to eliminate the "dead space" caused by member 
files marked as "deleted."  CL performs this task without the 
disk space appetite of LU's "-R" or NULU's "-K," and is itself 
only 4K in length.  It can also erase members from the LBR, lists 
and wildcards allowed. For CP/M 2.2, with runtime ZCPR3 support.

 Yes, it is possible to run DOS on your machine since you have a 8086
processor (CP/M 86), so your machine would be similar to the Z-100
which runs both CP/M 86 and DOS, but the only problem is that with the
8086 processor as opposed to the 8088 the machine isn't totally  100%
IBM compatible, but it runs some version of DOS written for the machine,
but reading other DOS disks (IBM, etc.) is not a problem.
  Something like DOS 1.0 - 2.0 might boot off your machine right off, but
no guarantees....  ( The Z-100's ran those versions when I used to use
them....and I went back and forth between DOS and CP/M with the Rdcpm
command, and maybe some other command for reading DOS disks....

Unfortunately, the Apple II diskette goes beyond mere data 
incompatibility and is physically incompatible with the IBM diskette.  
To read an Apple diskette in an IBM PC (or vice versa) an adapter is 
required.

For the IBM PC, several Apple II emulator boards exist, including the 
Trackstar board, which will support Apple II diskettes.  Imagine 
watching your IBM boot off of an Apple II DOS 3.3 Master!  (I seen it, 
I did!)

For the Apple II, Applied Engineering makes a IBM PC emulator board 
which will support the IBM PC disk format in an external drive.  I've 
not tried this product, but I hear good things.  In addition, there is 
a product called MatchPoint-PC, which will read PC diskettes in your 
Apple drive.  But it's not an emulator.

Sorry couldn't be of more help..

   While on the subject of disk formats, are there any programs
that will read Microbee 3.5" CP/M disks. As far as I am aware, the
Microbee (an Australian designed and built CP/M machine, which also
had some graphics support, until the company went broke :-( )
is the only CP/M machine that uses 3.5" disks, which hold 390K.

While I'm asking, I'll be really optimistic, and ask if there
are programs for the Microbee which will read IBM 3.5" disks 
(somehow I _really_ doubt it :)

If the 3.5" disk is physically compatible with ibm pc type
drives, then you can hack a set of parameter tables to match
them and use 22disk, a shareware program that runs on a PC.
My guess would be that the disks are single sided, double
density with either 5 1k sectors per track or 10 512btye
sectors per track, with first 2 tracks reserved for system.
My second guess would be double sided SINGLE DENSITY, which
the usual pc controller will not read. The 22disk instructions
do have a hardware patch to read single density, however.

If this is not urgent, and you don't have the experience to
use 22disk, you can send me a sample disk with a few files
on it (Non-critical stuff only, please) to me at
Prof. Clarence Wilkerson
Dept. Math.
Purdue University
West Lafayette, INdiana 47907

and I can probably figure it out.

One gotcha is if the drive is actually 3" and not 3.5".

In addition there is the FDC-10 disk controller card for the Apple II.  It
allows the connection of up to 4 IBM-PC disk drives, either 5.25" or 3.5".  The
drive can read an write MSDOS disks, but as of yet there is not a utility
to perform this task.  Disks can also be formated for use with ProDos (not to
be confused with compatability with an Apple disk drive formatted disk).

Hi!

This seems to be my week for needing strange and exotic things.

I need to obtain a PL/I compiler (close to full implementation) for any of
the three computers which I have:

	Microport Unix System V/386

	MS-DOS

	CP/M  (just about any soft-sector 5 1/4" format will do).

I would be grateful for any recommendations as to where I can find such an
animal.

Also, if you have one you don't need, how about letting me have it cheap?

Thanks,

Orville.

PL/I? On an MS-DOS or CP/M (!!!) platform with close to full
implementation? Well, the beast compiler we used to use on our
IBM 370 was a wee bit on the overweight side. I mean, when you 
stuff all the goodies from Algol, COBOL, FORTRAN and whatnot
in one bag, it won't exactly be petite. But lots of luck, and let

I had a PL/1 compiler for MS-DOS about 5 years ago.  I'll look around
my basement to see if I can come up with the manufacturer (I know it

Digital Research has (had?) a CP/M PL/I compiler, subset G.  My dim
recollection is that it was painfully slow and had about eleventy-
five passes, but it may be what you're looking for.

All I've got is a TRS-80 version of it.  It's Z-80 code, but I'm sure it has dos calls  for that system (NEWDOS80) and other calls from deep down in low memory.

I d/l'ed the cl10.lbr file from WSMR-Simtel20.army.mil the other
night, and it runs fine on my xerox 820-II. Just thought you'd
wanna know !! Thanx to the fellow who placed it there, I've been
looking for just such a utility for a while, but since I've
opened all my .lbr files now, I've limited use for it for a while.

Subject: PD C compilers for CP/M ?
Message-ID: <831@spam.ua.oz>

Are there any Public Domain C compilers for CP/M ?
I've had a quick look around simtel20, but didn't notice
any.
(note: by 'Public Domain', I would also like to know
about companies that don't support their C compilers
any more, who might have removed or loosened copyright restrictions )

(If there aren't any PD compilers around, which is the best _cheap_
C compiler around ... and does it come on *3.5"* CP/M 2.2 disks ? )
(yep, I bought myself one of the most orphaned orphan systems
around :-) not only aren't they made any more, but I can't easily
grab software from any other CP/M systems ... <sigh> )

Subject: PL/I compiler under CP/M.

I have it. But:

1-I never used it, the disk is there, I only ran one test to see if it works,
many years ago.
2-I do not have the slightest idea where I got it from, although it probably
migrated from a defunct SuperBrain as we had many of these on campus.
3-I have absolutely no documentation.
4-My CP/M machine, a LOBO-MAX80, is temporarily dismantled because kids and
grandchildren needed the room for a while. The backup I have is a DSDD 80 track
diskette. I guess that this format is not very practical.

Therefore:
-How do we handle the copyright problem?
-How **URGENT** is it? I can of course spend a few hours carrying the parts
of my Lobo to office to make a 40 tracks copy or even better write in MSDOS
format, but will do it only to meet a **REAL** need.

If answering this mail, **PLEASE** note that my strange userid phr00jg

Well I know of at least 1 other CPM machine that used 3.5" disks.

Sony.

We used the Sony CPM machines as a front end for an interactive video disk
system a zillion years ago.

With the 64k RAM, Sony's Basic with Video Disk extensions, we had about 28k
left for a program.

Worked great.  We "knocked their socks off" when we finally got it all
running.

Microbee still exists, but to my knowledge is not making CP/M
machines.  Microbee was bought out a few years ago by the
Serafini (sp?) brothers who run MicroHelp in Brunswick, Victoria.

Yes.  FBN Software which wrote PC-Alien also wrote Bee-Alien which
was sold by Microbee.  I bought a copy of this and it mostly works
(my version won't format IBM 5.25" 360k disks, but will read them
correctly).  There are some 3.5" MSDOS formats listed, but I haven't
tried them.

I have also written my own program to read and write IBM disks -
this will handle 5.25" 360k and 3.5" 720k.  It is known to work
on a 54k, 128k and 256k Microbee.  Since CP/M has an ambiguous 
file end, copying to CP/M and back to IBM will usually give you
some trailing garbage on a file (after a ^Z).

If you send me a 3.5" disk with return postage, I will put on it
a copy of Kermit-80 4.11 for the Microbee.

I have tried this and it didn't work.
I have two theories, neither has been tested.
1. Microbee disks have 10 sectors and the intersector space
   is shorter than specified in the Western Digital data sheet.
   The PC may not like this short space.
2. I think (but am not sure) that the sector header information
   is marked side 0 for both sides of the disk.  
   If the PC insists that side 1 is marked as side 1 ...

3.5", 10 512byte sectors per track, single sided, 390k
3.5", 10 512byte sectors per track, double sided, 780k
In both formats tracks 0 and 1 (both sides) are reserved for system.
I have the correct DPB entries and skew table if anyone wants them.

It was distributed by Digital Research.  The compiler first came out for 8080 in CP/M,
then migrated to 8086 & MS-DOS.  It was *quite* buggy;  I don't think DR ever released
any version beyond 1.0.  The compiler supposedly supported PL/I ANSI Subset G.

There is some sort of PL/I language *interpreter* on Simtel20.  Look for
RUNPLI or some such.

Digital Research made a PL/I compiler for CP/M. Don't know how full-featured
it was (I've never used it, and never used another PL/I compiler that I could
compare it to), but one of the guys here swears by it.

Don't know where you'd find a copy in this day and age, though.

I have an Osborne I which recently managed to get running again, but
after booting the system disk (and all the others I have) I discovered
that I have no format program, (the copy program is missing), nor do I
have enough information about the system to write my own format program.
Is there any Osborne I owner out there that would be willing to help?
I do have download capabilities, but the computer is pretty much useless 
as it is -- most the disks I have for it are full.  Thanks for any help 
in advance.

 On item 2:

  The SMC floppy controller on the SB180 (a '765 look-alike) is capable
of reading diskettes that have the side bit in the sector header wrong.
I don't know if the NEC or Intel chip acts the same, but if so the 
following may help:

	Write command:
			Command
			Unit/Head (controls hardware lines)
			Cyl
			Head (controls what is to/from disk)
			Record
			Size
			EOT
			GPL
			DTL

  On the FDC9266 setting the 'Unit/Head' bit to side one and the 'Head'
byte to side zero does work.

   The DR PL/I was a PL/I subset G compiler, whereas the VMS PL/I is a full
implementation.  PL/I was the Ada of the 1960's; enormous with every programmer
using a different subset.
   The DR compiler was still being sold as late as 1983.  I have a manual for
it somewhere, though I don't have the software.

I also downloaded qterm recently, but due to a total lack of
technical information for my computer (yes, it's a Microbee :),
I have very little idea what needs to be done to patch qterm
appropriately. If someone else has done the hard work for me,
I would love a working copy (note: it's a Microbee CIAB, 64k).
(I have ZSID and DDT, if you only have the patches).

Thanks in advance,
Yet another Microbee owner, 
(btw: how many Microbee owners read this group ? just curious ... )

CP411SRC.ARK	Kermit-80 V4.11 source files

The files in CP411HEX.ARK may be MLOADed together to give running
versions of Kermit-80 for various CP/M systems (see the file CPAAAA.HLP
for details). The sources in CP411SRC.ARK may be used to recompile
Kermit-80 and/or add support for new systems.

This is, of course, CP/M Kermit from Columbia University. New in this
version are advanced Server functions and SET COLLISION, among others
(see CPK411.ANN for details).

Is MIX C still available? Can it be gotten via mail-order or does it have
to be bought from the manufacturer? Any information about where to get it
or comments about the compiler are welcome.

Also, does anyone have an executable copy of XLISP? (Will MIX C compile
XLISP?) Here also, any info is appreciated.

Sure, such things were available.

Digital Research Inc sold a PL/1G compiler for CP/M.  "G" was supposed to be
a relatively machine independent subset of fully bloated IBM PL/1.
Supposedly a semi-international standard.  PL/1 G was available on a lot of
different platforms.  Maybe DRI still has a few copies of it, perhaps for
machines other than CP/M.

Also, LPI (I think it was LPI, or maybe it was Greenhills) builds their
compilers in PL/1, and since they have to port PL/1 first to each platform,
there's likely to be a commercial version of their PL/1 for the platform you
want.

I pondered using PL/1G on my CP/M machine, then I discovered it didn't allow
you to "*" array declarations in procedure argument declarations so I
abandoned it.

Microsoft did have a CP/M version of PL/I.  I have it laying around 
somewhere, sans docs, but I seem to remember it was a pretty good 
language.

Subject: Televideo TS-1603
Message-ID: <1370@unet.UUCP>

  I have a Televideo model TS-1603 that I aquired a few years ago, and 
just recently have renewed interest in setting it up. It is a CPM 
machine with Two half height floppys, a 14" monitor and I think 128K
ram ( It has been a while; I not possitive about the ram size). 

 Anyways, Does anyone in netland know of this machine? Will this machine
run some of the earlier DOS software? If not, is there some sort of 
conversion program to allow this? Where can I find a mouse and driver  
software for this unit. In general, Is this machine worth booting up  
and spending some money on. I am trying to expand my computational- 
horizons and figure that this machine should be capable of providing  
me with some hours of programming enjoyment. 

   Any information would be useful and greatly appreciated!!

Message-ID: <W8SDZ.12692256272.BABYL@WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL>

If you do not have FTP access to SIMTEL20, files may be ordered by
e-mail from LISTSERV@VM1.NODAK.EDU or LISTSERV@VM.ECS.RPI.EDU.

           If you are on BITNET: LISTSERV@NDSUVM1
                                 LISTSERV@RPIECS

   If your mailer knows domains: listserv@vm1.nodak.edu
				 listserv@vm.ecs.rpi.edu

If your mailer wants bang paths: uunet!vm1.nodak.edu!listserv
				 uunet!vm.ecs.rpi.edu!listserv

If you use bang paths, substitute your nearest neighbor which is also
on the Internet for uunet in the examples above.  Some examples are:
ames, decvax, decwrl, harvard, hplabs, nosc, rutgers, sharkey, sun,
ucbvax, ucsd, udel, uw-beaver, wuarchive.

Send this command to the server to get its help file:

GET PDGET HELP

Sample command (which gets our catalog of MS-DOS files):

/PDGET MAIL PD:<MSDOS.FILEDOCS>SIMIBM.ARC UUENCODE

These commands should be sent as the body of a regular email message.
Do not include a signature because it confuses the server.  If you
have xxdecode, you may wish to specify XXENCODE instead of UUENCODE to
avoid character translation problems.

Comments, questions, and suggestions should be directed to the LISTSERV
manager at one of these addresses, depending on which server you normally
use:

                    Internet                  BITNET

  "John Fisher" <FISHER@VM.ECS.RPI.EDU>   <FISHER@RPIECS>
  "Marty Hoag"  <INFO@VM1.NODAK.EDU>      <INFO@NDSUVM1>

DO NOT send your comment or question about the servers to SIMTEL20.
However, if you wish to report a program bug or to request information
on how to upload files to SIMTEL20, you may send e-mail to me at one
of the addresses below.

[File: SIMTEL20.INF                    Last revised: May 9, 1991]

   is temporarily off-line.  We are sorry for the inconvenience
   to our users.]

                     THE SIMTEL20 ARCHIVES

OVERVIEW

There is a colossal amount of free public domain and shareware
software for the CP/M, PCDOS/MSDOS, Macintosh, and UNIX operating
systems, and for the DoD standard programming language, Ada, in
several archives on WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL (IP host 192.88.110.20),
a DECSYSTEM-20 running the TOPS-20 operating system at White Sands
Missile Range, New Mexico.  Archives of correspondence for several
mailing lists are also available.

    [SIMTEL20 is a contraction of SIMulation and TELeprocessing, the
    name of the branch that originally purchased the machine and in
    whose building the system still resides, and the "20" in
    DECSYSTEM-20.  The convention of including the "20" in some form
    or another was popular with other DECSYSTEM-20 systems at the time
    SIMTEL20 was named, such as MIT-XX at MIT and SCORE at Stanford.]

You can obtain these files using the InterNet file transfer protocol,
FTP (described in a following paragraph), with user-name "anonymous".
For a login password, use "guest", your host-name, or any other string
of printing characters.  Throughout this message, FTP examples are
given in a GENERIC syntax.  You will have to consult either local
documentation or your friendly system wizard to learn the actual
syntax used with your local mainframe operating system.  For the sake
of brevity, the full host name "WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL" will be
dropped from further references to SIMTEL20 in this discussion.  Also
please note that square brackets may be used in place of angle brackets
in referring to directory names.  For example, pd1:[msdos.filedocs]
is the same as pd1:<msdos.filedocs>

There are many helpful files in the default ANONYMOUS ftp directory.
Please look at these if you have need for further information on
specific collections.

To obtain directory listings, connect to SIMTEL20 via FTP and get
these files:

  pd1:<msdos>msdos.crclst
  pd1:<pc-blue>pc-blue.crclst
  pd2:<cpm>cpm.crclst
  pd2:<cpmug>cpmug.crclst
  pd2:<sigm>sigm.crclst
  pd8:<hz100>hz100.crclst
  pd5:<macintosh>macintosh.crclst
  pd8:<misc>misc.crclst
  pd6:<unix-c>unix-c.crclst
  pd2:<ada>ada.crc

There is also a comma-delimited directory listing in each top-level
directory, FILES.IDX, which is suitable for importing into a database
program.  This file may be of greater use than the crclst files
because it can be compared against an earlier version of the same file
to produce a complete list of files added and deleted from the
archives.  Using the comma-delimited fields it is possible to build a
script for FTP to maintain a parallel archive.  FILES.IDX can be
printed or displayed with a simple BASIC program.  For more information
see PD1:<MSDOS.FILEDOCS>AAAREAD.ME.

The <CPM>, <MSDOS>, and <MACINTOSH> archives are the ones to watch for
the very latest offerings, as they are updated frequently.

The <CPMUG>, <SIGM> and <PC-BLUE> archives contain software distributed
by the CP/M Users Group, the SIG/M Users Group and the PC-Blue Users
Group respectively.  This software is available on diskettes from the
associated user groups, and the archives are updated as new volumes
are issued.  The <PC-BLUE> archive contains software for the IBM-PC
and similar machines.

The <MSDOS> archives also contain software for the MSDOS and PCDOS
operating systems; but these archives are locally managed, and
therefore are updated more frequently than the <PC-BLUE> archive.

The <UNIX-C> archive contains a variety of UNIX tools.  Those which
apply specifically to CP/M are in the directory <UNIX-C.CPM>.

The <ADA> archive is growing rapidly. Information about this archive
is in directory PD2:<ADA.GENERAL>.  In general, the archived software
is very good, having been worked-over and refined by many users.  The
documentation and comments tend to be complete and informative.

Files in all of these archives can be obtained using the FTP procedures
described in this message.

PLEASE NOTE:  Due to the large number of files available, the archive
maintainers cannot possibly attempt to validate the proper operation of
the various programs.  When a program bug is reported, immediate action
is taken to either correct the error or remove the offending program
from the archives.  Still, users must understand that all archive
programs are offered AS IS, and the archive maintainers specifically
disclaim any liability should these programs malfunction or cause
damage, incidental or otherwise.  When testing ANY new software, be
certain that all information stored on disk is backed-up before you
start, so that you can recover if files are damaged or erased.  This is
particularly true if you have a hard disk, in which case malfunctions
can be spectacularly disasterous.

FILE TYPES

Files are stored in two formats: Text files such as those with names
that end with DOC, HEX, INF and ASM are sometimes stored as ASCII
files, but sometimes these files are stored in binary compressed
form.  Binary storage is also used for executable (COM and EXE) and
library/archive files  (LBR and ARC).  All binary data are stored as
four 8-bit bytes per 36-bit SIMTEL20 word, with the low-order four
bits of each word filled with zeros.  If such a file is interpreted
as a contiguous string, as will happen if a straight binary transfer
is made to a 16 or 32-bit UNIX machine, the four zero filler-bits per
36-bit group will cause rather bizarre and frustrating results.

For information on ARC, ARK, LZH, ZIP, ZOO, LBR, squeezed and crunched files,
get PD2:<CPM.STARTER-KIT>00-FILES.DOC and/or PD1:<MSDOS.STARTER>00-FILES.DOC.

Although the type of storage used for a particular file can usually be
inferred from the file-name, this is not always true.  It is a good idea
to check the appropriate "crclst" of "idx" file to ascertain the storage
format used for each file of interest.  Now, and for the foreseeable
future, storage formats for files in the <SIGM>, <CPMUG> and <PC-BLUE>
archives can be determined from their "generation numbers", as shown by
the FTP directory command.  For example, the FTP command:

  dir pd1:<pc-blue.vol001>

will yield results of the form:

  -CATALOG.001.2
  ABSTRACT.001.2
  BW.ASM.2
  BW.BAS.1
  BW.EXE.1
  COLOR.ASM.2
  COLOR.BAS.1
  COLOR.EXE.1
  ...and so on

All files with names ending in ".1" are stored in binary format, and
those with names ending in ".2" are stored in ASCII.  This relationship
will continue to apply for files in the <SIGM>, <CPMUG> and <PC-BLUE>
archives until further notice.

WARNING: Because the public domain archives on SIMTEL20 consume a huge
amount of disk space, storage capacity will be conserved by the
greatest practical use of libraries, archives, crunched and squeezed
files, all of which are stored in binary format.  If you cannot
properly transfer binary files, you are going to be VERY FRUSTRATED!
If you need help, please contact your local system wizard and provide
him/her with a copy of this message.  Having done that, if you are
still unable to make things work correctly, send a message to
Action@WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL and someone will try to help you.
Please provide the following information:

 1. Machine and operating system  (e.g., VAX-11/780, 4.3 BSD UNIX)
 2. Network software in use  (e.g., 3-Com UNET)
 3. Complete list of available FTP commands  (e.g., GET, PUT, etc.)

Important files in the <CPMUG> and <PC-BLUE> archives are the
CATALOG files. These files, which are stored in ASCII, contain the
"-CATALOG.nnn" files from all the volumes of their respective archives.
To obtain these composite catalog files, connect to SIMTEL20 via FTP
and get these files:

  pd2:<cpmug>cpmug.cat
  pd1:<pc-blue.vol000>pcblue.cat

Similar files exist for the <SIGM> archive, but they are stored in
squeezed form.  These files, when unsqueezed, yields SIG0.CAT and
SIG1.CAT (the catalog).

  pd2:<sigm.vol000>sig0.cqt
  pd2:<sigm.vol000>sig1.cqt

(NOTE: That's "L-and-three-zeros" in "vol000")

FILE TRANSFER VIA FTP

FTP stands for File Transfer Protocol, a formalized procedure for
moving files among machines on the Defense Data Network (DDN) and other
networks that connect with the DDN.  The protocol is implemented by a
program often called FTP.  The different mainframe operating systems
implement FTP with variations in command syntax.  Some systems have the
remote-file-name precede the local-file-name in the command.  Others
reverse this order.  Some versions have the whole command on a single
input line, while others use multiple lines.  Read the documentation
for your local system, or consult a friendly system wizard for the
details of your local FTP command syntax.

UNIX users can do something like "man ftp" for on-line instructions.
However, not all UNIX FTP programs are called "ftp", so you may have
to snoop around in the system directories or ask a system wizard for
the correct local name to use with the "man" command.  ITS users can
do ":INFO FTP", and "HELP FTP" works on TOPS-20 and some other
operating systems.  I will be happy to update this message with
pointers to other sources of on-line documentation if they are sent
to w8sdz@WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL.

FTP transfers from SIMTEL20 can be made with user-name "anonymous".
Use GUEST for the password.  For anonymous logins, SIMTEL20 supports
the FTP "change working directory" command.  (Your local syntax may
be something like CD, or CWD).  Ignore the message which may appear
that prompts you to enter a password.  This command allows you to
specify a default SIMTEL20 directory to be used for all file
retrievals, and thereby relieves you from having to repeatedly type
"pdx:<whatever>" as part of each filename.  For example, you can do
something like this:

  cd pd1:<msdos.goodstuff>
  get filename-1
  get filename-2
  ...and so on

instead of using the longer filename forms shown in previous examples.

Users of TOPS-10, TENEX, or TOPS-20 systems can use "image" or "paged"
mode for ALL transfers.  UNIX and other users must use "ascii" mode for
ASCII files, and "type tenex" or "type L 8" mode for binary files.

All aspects of the FTP process for UNIX machines have been automated
to a high degree by two programs in directory PD8:<MISC.UNIX>. With
these programs, a simple command like "sh autoftp30.sh mylist &" can
be run in no-hangup background mode to transfer multiple files from
SIMTEL20 without the user remaining logged-in on the local system.
For more information, get the file PD8:<MISC.UNIX>AUTOFTP30.TAR-Z, a
compressed tar archive.  After transferring it to your Unix host,
rename to autoftp30.tar.Z, uncompress, and extract with tar.  Also
see BATCHFTP102.TAR-Z which is an enhanced version of autoftp.

MAILING LIST CORRESPONDENCE ARCHIVES

Copies of correspondence for several mailing lists are kept on SIMTEL20
in directories with names of the form PD2:<ARCHIVES.KEYWORD>, where
"KEYWORD" has been chosen to indicate the associated mailing list.  At
present, the following correspondence archives are available:

   mailing list       mail archive filename
  ---------------     ---------------------
  ADA-SW              PD2:<ARCHIVES.ADA-SW>
  AMETHYST-USERS      PD2:<ARCHIVES.AMETHYST>
  INFO-68K            PD2:<ARCHIVES.68K>
  INFO-APPLE          PD2:<ARCHIVES.APPLE>
  INFO-CPM            PD2:<ARCHIVES.CPM>
  INFO-FORTH          PD2:<ARCHIVES.FORTH>
  INFO-IBMPC          PD2:<ARCHIVES.IBMPC>
  INFO-MICRO          PD2:<ARCHIVES.MICRO>
  INFO-MODEMS         PD2:<ARCHIVES.MODEMS>
  INFO-MODEMXX        PD2:<ARCHIVES.MODEMXX>
  INFO-MODULA-2       PD2:<ARCHIVES.MODULA-2>
  INFO-PASCAL         PD2:<ARCHIVES.PASCAL>
  INFO-XENIX310       PD2:<ARCHIVES.XENIX310>
  INFO-XMODEM         PD2:<ARCHIVES.XMODEM>
  NORTHSTAR-USERS     PD2:<ARCHIVES.NORTHSTAR>
  UNIX-SW             PD2:<ARCHIVES.UNIX-SW>
  VIDEOTECH           PD2:<ARCHIVES.VIDEOTECH>

Descriptions of these and other mailing lists can be obtained via FTP
with anonymous login (as for SIMTEL20) from FTP.NISC.SRI.COM.  Ask for
the file netinfo/interest-groups (an ASCII file).  And please note,
this is NOT on SIMTEL20.

File names for SIMTEL20 mailing list correspondence archives have two
forms.  For example, in PD2:<ARCHIVES.CPM>, which holds the INFO-CPM
correspondence (the "INFO-" is assumed), the forms are: yymm.n-TXT or
yymm.n-TXT-Z.  Files with names ending in -Z were compressed with a
Unix compress-compatible program.  The characters "yymm" in the file
names are the digits of the year and month of the messages in each
particular file.  The "n" was incremented as overflowed 150 disk pages
(approximately 375K).  The current month's correspondence is kept in
CPM-ARCHIV.TXT, which is constantly growing as new messages arrive.
There may also temporarily exist files named CURRENT.n-TXT, which hold
the overflow of the current month's messages when CPM-ARCHIV.TXT is
split into monthly files.  Although INFO-CPM has been used as an
example here, the same naming scheme is used for the other mailing list
files as well.  For a complete list of available files, connect to
SIMTEL20 via FTP and do this:

  dir PD2:<ARCHIVES>

You will receive a list of names of the form:

  KEYWORD.DIRECTORY.n

where "n" is one or more digits.  For example, the INFO-CPM listing
currently appears as "CPM.DIRECTORY.1"  To then get a list of files in
a particular archive, do this:

  dir PD2:<ARchives.keyword>

where "keyword" (for example, "cpm") is chosen from the preceding list,
and the word "directory" and the number "n" are not used.  At present,
all of these files are stored in ASCII.

Message-ID: <1991Jun9.232502.20279@baron.uucp>

I am looking to locate and purchase some extra high density floppy disks
that were used in the Drivetec 320 drives, as in the Kaypro Robie and
the Kaypro 4X computers.  They were made by Brown Disk in Colorado and
were their model UHR-II.  (Maxell may also have made some.)  The disks
are a preformatted servo track type with usable space of 2.67 mb.  They
are 192 tpi, and were formatted with 17 512 byte sectors per track.  In
appearance, they are very much like the conventional 5.25" floppy except
for the notches in the jacket edge.  See crude representation below:

One place to look for this compiler would be UK, where a couple of
years ago it was sold on *3-inch* disks for the Amstrad.  I ignored
it then, but a couple of weeks back thought I'd buy a copy, for fun.
Sure enough, it was no longer around - but someone probably has a 
second-hand one.

I have uploaded to SIMTEL20:

pd2:<cpm.arc-lbr>
EXL.LBR		Types/extracts squeezed, crunched, LZH files

EXL is a program that will type or print squeezed (.?Q?) crunched (.?Z?)
or LZH compressed (.?Y?) files. It will also uncompress these to a disk
file. In addition, it will do this directly out of a .LBR file, so it is
possible to type a LZH compressed file that is inside a .LBR, or print
it, or extract it to disk. It also has full user area support: users
0 through 31 can be accessed.

Hint - try 'A>EXL EXL EXL.DYC'

Subject: I seem to have it now!
Message-ID: <9052584@ub.cc.umich.edu>

Sorry for wasting space, but I have QTERM mostly working now.  At least as far
as I have yet explored.  The problems I was having with vt100 resulted from havi
having junk character trapping turned on.  Still drops the odd character at
2400 baud, but not when I'm using vt100 functions, so that's tolerable.
I like this.  The vt100 emulator is much nicer than the one I had been using.
Does anyon have handy a list of the most commonly used vt100 functions?  I know
only that control-r redraws the screen, for instance.  (The "function keys"
themselves are another matter.  I have figured out how to use escape+ sequences
to do some of that stuff.)
 
Well now I'll run along and read the docs like a good little cp/m-er.
Those of you who wrote to me asking for help with the thing please send more
mail: I've lost most of your addresses.

Message-ID: <9052520@ub.cc.umich.edu>

For all of you waiting with baited breath to hear if I got QTERM running on
my Kaypro II, the answer is, sort of.
 
At 2400 baud characters are dropped.  This also happens with several other
terminal programs (MEX, KERMIT, and a vt100 emulator that I'm using at the
moment), most notably in the third column.  There is one program, FASTTERM,
that avoids this problem on this machine at that speed, so it seems to be
possible.  If I turn on the "junk character trap" about half or more of the
incoming characters are missing.
 
vt100 emulation does not work at all.  All I get is a row of +++++ with some
incoming characters let through at random.  If you have any suggestions about
this I'd love to hear, because the vt100 ability is one of the things that most
strongly attracted me to QTERM in the first place.  I used the QT-KPRO patch
to set this up, by the way.
 
 
So far I haven't had time to look over the docs thoroughly.  I did note a
scrambled line in QTERM.DOC.  Near the bottom of the first page of printed
output are a couple of lines as follows:
 
"? -Print help - QTERM provides a brief synopsis of the available commands.
 
 a 3/10th second break.
 
 , - Hang up modem - "  (etc.)
Is this a typo, or have I yet again got a corrupted file (in which case all
bets are off anyway)?
 
One other thing: I have retrieved and downloaded the files twice from Simtel.
Using EXL to unpack them, there's a junk trailing character on the end
of the patch filenames, so QT-KPRO.Z becomes QT-KPRO.Z ' (except that the '
is the other way around--I don't know how to produce that character).  Is this
normal?
 
I've been having trouble ftp-ing files from Simtel.  The trend is that they
start sending ok, then slow down after about 30k has been sent, get slower,
slower, and finally timeout, sometimes after about an hour.  Anyone else
having trouble, or should I look to the local system?

Ben, 

Yes, MIX C compiler is still available and you can get it from 
me.  The price is $20.00 plus $5.00 S&H for either the CP/M or 
the IBMPC version or $30.00 for both.  The manual alone is well 
worth the price.

If you're interested in ordering or for additional info, contact 
me at any address below.  Take care.

Subject: PL/I
Message-ID: <676535093.481050.KLENSIN@INFOODS.MIT.EDU>

I replied privately on this, but, since there seems to be some 
confusion and enough interest, this is intended to be a
clarification/correction to several recent messages. 

--There are two ANSI Standards for PL/I, with ISO parallels.  They are, 
respectively,
  ANSI X3.53-1976, Reaffirmed 1987.  Also known as ISO6166.  This 
describes "full" PL/I.  Implementations claiming conformance to this
are, or were, available from PRIME and several mainframe-sized machines 
of the Honeywell (Bull), Sperry (Univac), Sperry (Burroughs), etc., 
persuasion.  For a number of technical reasons, the IBM compilers for 
the 370-architecture machines do not conform to this Standard, but, if 
one avoids certain uses of the aggregate language and programs around a 
few built-in functions, the level of compatibility is reasonably good.
  ANSI X3.74-1987.  Also known as ISO6522.  This describes "PL/I General 
Purpose Subset" (USA) or "General Purpose PL/I" (ISO).  This is a 
language that contains most important features of X3.53, plus a few 
updating extensions.  It is intended to be very portable, yet large 
enough to do useful applications work.  The original version of this 
Standard (see below) did not have the latter property, and may have 
lacked the former one. It would take a relatively small number of
upward-compatible modifications to bring, either the IBM mainframe
compilers or an X3.53-conforming compiler into conformance with this. 
  It is inappropriate for anyone to claim conformance to any other 
Standard at this point.
  However, there was a previous version of X3.74, completed in 1981.  It 
represents a smaller subset of the language than the 1987 version, a 
subset that turned out, in practice, to be much too small for practical 
and portable applications work, although it was adequate for certain 
systems programming tasks, such as writing PL/I (and other) compilers.  
The DEC VAX/VMS and Data General compilers, at least one of the 
[non-mainframe] IBM compilers, and several other things floating around 
claim conformance to X3.74-1981.  Almost all of these contain extensions 
that bring the general size of the language to approximately that of 
X3.74-1987: each vendor's customers discovered that the 1981 subset was 
too small to do practical work and insisted on modifications.

Now...

>I saw an ad in PC Week (or was it Byte?) some months ago for a PL\I compiler
>for '386s.  It wasn't DR or MS or IBM.
  Almost certainly LPI.  LPI claims conformance to X3.74 and, in their 
advertising, strongly implies that the "X3.74" they are talking about is 
the current (1987) version.  It isn't.  They have an implementation 
that, at best, narrowly conforms to the obsolete 1981 version.  Comments 
above about the suitability of the 1981 version apply.  Questions have 
been raised about even that level of conformance, and LPI has 
historically (I haven't called them in a year or so) not been enthused 
about outside critical evaluation.  I have heard from a number of 
unhappy customers, but it could be a biased sample.  The LPI compilers 
are not in the "cheap" or "free" category, by a considerable margin.  
They run under several flavors of U**X, and on an MSDOS base.  If I 
recall, the latter require 386s and significant memory.

>>I need to obtain a PL/I compiler (close to full implementation) for any of
  Something could be "close to full implementation" if it conformed, or 
nearly conformed, to one of:
  ANSI X3.53-1976 / ISO6166
  ANSI X.74-1997 / ISO6522
  The de facto "standard" of the IBM PL/I Optimizing Compiler.

   An old and interesting slander.  X3.53-1976 is a smaller language 
than today's Ada, which exists on several of the machine types cited.  
And X3.74 (even the 1987 version) is arguably smaller than the proposed 
Fortran 9X and even the current version of ANSI/ISO BASIC.  One way to 
view the derivation process that produced X3.74 was that the committee 
went back to X3.53 and pruned everything that was not appropriate for 
wide implementation, everything that was really not needed for any good 
purpose or that had been proven to be error-prone, and everything that 
could not be done in a way that permitted widely-available and accepted 
implementations to conform.  It is really a nice way to work on a 
standard or anything else, and, if done well, produces a great deal of
cleanliness as distinct from the appearance of warts on cancerous 
growths that is often associated with stuffing several generations of 
"modern" features into languages that were never intended to accomodate 
them.  How do I know?  I chaired the committee during most of the 
critical period.
   Keep in mind that the first serious commercial implementations of
PL/I, the so-called IBM PL/I level F and level D compilers, ran on
machines that, by today's standards, were very small.  The level D 
compiler in particular ran on the System 360/Model 20, a 16 bit machine 
that was typically configured with 16Kb or less of memory and that would 
run only about 2/3 of the 360 instruction set.

>Digital Research Inc sold a PL/1G compiler for CP/M.  "G" was supposed to be

   During its development period in circa 1975-1980, the standards 
technical committee (called "X3J1", another term you will see floating 
around) referred to what became X3.74-1981 as "subset G".  That internal 
terminology was picked up by DRI to make make "PL/I-G" and "Subset G 
PL/I" terms.  Neither language ever existed in the standards arena.  
More important, whatever they are, they are not PL/I even though they 
share syntax with it.  Their implementations of a number of features 
are, to put it mildly, "novel".  And, has been mentioned, their 
implementations are infested with bugs.  My impression, from having used 
all three, is that the CP/M-80 version is in better shape than the 
CP/M-86 version, which is in better shape than the MSDOS version.
   None of the three were ever actively and effectively maintained and 
that situation got worse when DRI effectively went out of the language 
business.

  It is, or was, LPI.  If, by "commercial", you mean "they sell it", 
then "yes".  If "commercial" means "suitable for developing commercial 
programs", then this is questionable.

  Or bit strings longer than 16 bits, or many uses of BASED variables, 
or the PL/I condition-handling model, or,.....

>Microsoft did have a CP/M version of PL/I.  
   No, Microsoft didn't.  Digital Research did.  The original CP/M-80 
version started as a pet project of Gary Kildall's.
>I have it laying around  somewhere, sans docs, 
   The quality of the documentation was such that you aren't missing 
very much.
>but I seem to remember it was a pretty good language. 
   The nasty comments above relate to the relationship between what DRI 
was selling and "full implementation" or "Standard" PL/I.  If one viewed
it as a PL/I-like language and could work around the bugs and 
idiosyncracies in that context, the code quality, optimizations, etc., 
especially of the CP/M-80 version were somewhere between "excellent" and 
"outstanding".

IBM does make a compiler for OS/2.  I have not tested it, but, from what 
I can tell from documents and rumors, it appears to be pretty solid.  I 
understand IBM has announced that conformance to X3.74-1987 is a 
strategic direction (or words to that effect) for this compiler.

Message-ID: <9106100853.AA00261@cwns1.INS.CWRU.Edu>

  I have a Televideo model TS-1603 that I aquired a few years ago, and
just recently have renewed interest in setting it up. It is a CPM
machine with Two half height floppys, a 14" monitor and I think 128K
ram ( It has been a while; I not possitive about the ram size).

 Anyways, Does anyone in netland know of this machine? Will this machine
run some of the earlier DOS software? If not, is there some sort of
conversion program to allow this? Where can I find a mouse and driver
software for this unit. In general, Is this machine worth booting up
and spending some money on. I am trying to expand my computational-
horizons and figure that this machine should be capable of providing
me with some hours of programming enjoyment.

   Any information would be useful and greatly appreciated!!

Ken,

I am familiar with (though I've never seen one) the TeleVideo 
1603.  It is a 16 bit computer, so it would run the CP/M-86 
flavor of CP/M (an important distinction when looking for 
software).  It will also run an early version of IBM PCDOS 
(probably 2.0 or some such).  It is expandable to 256K RAM.

I hope that this info was of some help.  Take care.

I have received many inquiries about why SIMTEL20 does not publish
instructions for uploading files for those who wish to submit their
programs.  The reason is that we prefer to coordinate uploads by
having contributors contact us first so we can check to make sure the
program is not already in the repository.

File uploads are accepted via FTP using a special uploading account,
and via e-mail using a special mailbox which does not interfere with
regular correspondence.

If you have a program to upload please send e-mail to me with a short
description of the files you wish to submit.

Thanks to all those who are actively supporting the respository by
helping us keep up to date with the latest programs.

========================= Digital Research PL/I for CP/M =======================

PL/I? On an MS-DOS or CP/M (!!!) platform with close to full
implementation? Well, the beast compiler we used to use on our
IBM 370 was a wee bit on the overweight side. I mean, when you 
stuff all the goodies from Algol, COBOL, FORTRAN and what-not
in one bag, it won't exactly be petite. But lots of luck, and let
us know if you find anything!

[Do you mean the one that would compile a blank card, produce a bunch of
error messages like "missing BEGIN -- generated", etc. to produce an
executable load module that occupied quite a few K of memory and
which had the same effect as IEFBR14? :-)]

Remember that long ago, in a place far away, FORTRAN & COBOL were compiled on
cpus with 4096 words of memory (not kilobytes or megabytes, just 4,096).

Digital Research Inc. sold a PL/1G compiler for CP/M.  "G" was supposed to be
a relatively machine independent subset of fully bloated IBM PL/1.
Supposedly a semi-international standard.  PL/1 G was available on a lot of
different platforms.

I've got a copy of Digital Research's PL/I.  This is a Subset G
implementation, under CP/M.  The package includes DR's RMAC (a fancy macro 
assembler), librarian, linker, other utilities, and the documentation.  
I also have DR's ISAM package (don't recall the name at the moment, but it 
was a nice little package for CP/M).

I did have experience with the CP/M one.  If I remember correctly 
(which may not be the case) Digital Research produced
that one.  It was not even a G subset and had enough limitations to
drive you crazy.  They ported it to MS-DOS without enhancements.  I haven't
heard anything about it for years.  If that is all you can find, you
have my sympathy.

I did some programming projects with it at an old job many
years ago.  I don't know how complete you need, but it filled
my bill.

I don't know about the fate of PLI-80, but PLI-86 was sold to
another company whose name I don't recall.  It's supported pretty
lousily.  If you can get your hands on PLI-80, it might be sufficient 
for MS-DOS, using one of the commercial CPM/Z80 emulators (there are 
both hardware as well as software packages).

It was very limited: 64K for code & 64K data on 8086, and of course
64k for CP/M-80. The code produced was very good though. We use it in 1985
to write a small cad package using GEM. They also had a database manager and
a screen designer, which were sold as separate items.

"PL/0.25" would be closer to the truth.  It is also full of bugs, with the 
bug level increasing as one moves from CP/M-80 toward MessDOS.  
You can probably find someone to sell it to you, possibly even DRI.  
But they don't fix bugs, and the documentation stinks, and it isn't really 
PL/I in any of the conventional or Standard dialects.

My dim recollection is that it was painfully slow and had about eleventy-
five passes, but it may be what you're looking for.

As I remember the Digital Research PL/I compiler was not real compatable
with our VAX PL/I stuff - as in major recoding.

The DR PL/I was a PL/I subset G compiler, whereas the VMS PL/I is a full
implementation.  PL/I was the Ada of the 1960's; enormous with every programmer
using a different subset. [I think I object to Ada being compared to PL/I :-)]
The DR compiler was still being sold as late as 1983.

The Digital Research PL/I compiler was a rather rich subset G implementation.
The G subset is far from "big" PL/I but it is quite adequate (I missed the
select) for most practical things.  Moreover, since PL/I is so unpopular, I
found the code to be very portable, nobody wants to enhance anything.  The
most robust implementation was for CP/M-80, worked great on 8080, 8085, and
Z80 machines, I never checked the later models.  

I pondered using PL/1G on my CP/M machine, then I discovered it didn't allow
you to "*" array declarations in procedure argument declarations so I
abandoned it.

[Note -- Digital Research is still around -- I got some e-mail from someone
there recently regarding another subject. I think their main product now is
an MS-DOS clone. I don't know what the status of their PL/I product is].

========================= Digital Research PL/I for MS-DOS =====================

It was distributed by Digital Research.  The compiler first came out for 8080 
in CP/M, then migrated to 8086 & MS-DOS.  It was *quite* buggy;  I don't think 
DR ever released any version beyond 1.0.  The compiler supposedly supported 
PL/I ANSI Subset G.

The CP/M-86 version was a hastily translated (the translate program was 
written in PL/I-80 and the turkeys lost the source!) and although a little 
wobbly, also worked rather well.  When it appeared that CP/M-86 was going 
to lose, big time, to MS-DOS they did a quick and dirty conversion to MS-DOS 
1.1 [sic] and it was the worst of the bunch.  It was cantakerous and generally 
unreliable.  I don't know which one IBM shipped, probably CP/M-86, I doubt 
that the DOS version could have passed even the least stringent acceptance 
tests.

I can't guarantee the linker will work under 3.x or up since I have never 
tested it. I used it once under MS-DOS 2.x. 

========================= Language Processors, Inc. ============================

Check with a company called Language Processors, Inc., in Massachusetts.  I
THINK that they are mostly Unix-based, but they may have MS-DOS compilers as
well.  Data General sells their PL/I compiler on 386/ix and on DG/UX.  I have
no phone number, but you can write to them at:

		Language Processors, Inc.
		959 Concord St.
		Framingham, MA  01701

I know of two PL/I compilers available on Unix, one is made by LPI and
the other is not commercially available.  The only thing I know about the
LPI compiler is that it's expensive.

LPI makes a putative PL/I for several U**X environments and, 
allegedly, for MS-DOS (running in 386 mode with extenders, if I recall).  
I think their prices start in the $1200 vicinity and go up rapidly, but 
my memory is pretty vague.  The compiler is close to, but not quite 
conforming (if I recall) to ANSI X3.74-1981.  Unfortunately, that 
Standard is obsolete and represented a language a little too small to 
get any useful work done.  And LPI has traditionally been very hard to 
deal with.

LPI makes PL/I for '386 UNIX and while I have no experience with it, 
the genes are good.  It, like LPI's other languages, was shrunk down from 
"big" PL/I and was written in PL/I.  Maybe their C compiler is written in C, 
but I'm pretty sure their others are written in PL/I.  I'm a little sorry that 
the language fell into such ill repute, if you avoid the chrome and tail fins 
it's a pretty good language.  I lust for its BCD arithmetic for money 
calculations and I still understand its structures better than C.  
It's certainly possible to write a bad program in PL/I but it's lots easier 
to write something unreadable in C. [Please -- no language wars here!!!].
If LPI did V/386 PL/I correctly, I have no reason to believe they didn't, it
should be trim and compact.  They've certainly got their code generator act
together by now and the linker shouldn't carry along any baggage you didn't
ask for.  I'll also speculate that it's subset G with some extensions (select
maybe?  huh? Huh? :-) which should be sufficient for as much work as you'd
want to do on a '386.

Also, LPI (I think it was LPI, or maybe it was Greenhills) builds their
compilers in PL/1, and since they have to port PL/1 first to each platform,
there's likely to be a commercial version of their PL/1 for the platform you
want.

========================= Other Suggestions ============================

There is an IBM-supplied compiler that runs under OS/2.  I haven't 
been able to exercise it, but it is apparently ok.  But you didn't 
mention OS/2 in your little list.  I also don't imagine it is cheap.

There are a few folks around who claim to be able to translate PL/I 
automatically into, e.g., C.  I don't believe a word of it, but could 
probably dig out a list if you wanted it.

There is some sort of PL/I language *interpreter* on Simtel20.  Look for
RUNPLI or some such.  

I saw an ad in PC Week (or was it Byte?) some months ago for a PL/I compiler
for '386s.  It wasn't DR or MS or IBM.

Message-ID: <CMM.0.90.0.676586887.freeman@watsun.cc.columbia.edu>

In a recent Info-CPM Digest issue, Steve Graham
(steve_graham@ub.cc.umich.edu) reports a problem with EXL putting a
spurious character in files extracted from a .LBR-file. This is indeed
the case and the problem manifests itself when a file whose
uncompressed filetype is a single character (e.g., .Z). Dunno whether a
2-character uncompressed filetype produces the problem. What happens is
that instead of filling the remaining two bytes of the filetype with
spaces (20H), only the first is so filled, the third byte being set to
zero. This causes the file not to be accesible after extraction (though
you can rename it with NSWEEP, DISK77 etc.). Am working on a patch now.

   Well, I haven't heard any replies to my earlier followup
about QTerm on Microbee (CP/M) computers, so I decided to post
this. My question : 
Has anyone got patches/working executable for QTerm on a Microbee system ?

If not, has anyone got any information about programming I/O on
a Microbee, or can anyone recommend any books on the subject.
(If I have to I'll try to remember some Z80 assembler, and
write the QTerm patches myself, but I have no information
on using the PIO (or is it UART? - shows how little docs I have :)
in the Microbee )

Yes, MIX C for CP/M is still avaialble from MIX Software.

I've never heard of a mail-order house carrying it, but why worry?  MIX 
has a watts line, and the price is undeer $20.  Plus, you can get the same
compiler for MS-DOS for  only $5 more.  Sorry, I don't have the watts or the
address with me right now.

The MIX C compiler is not ANSI-C compatible, though it is a decent compiler.

They also make a POWER C compiler for MSDOS that is ANSI.

[Nope, the $5 "upgrade" doesn't move you from MIX C to POWER C, MIX C is avail.

Message-ID: <1991Jun10.163332.29768@cadence.com>

As of 1988 the VAX VMS PL/I compiler was not a full implementation of the
language as defined by IBM.

I had a 65,000 line PL/I program for the IBM 3090 that required
15,000 lines of changes just to get it to compile under VAX PL/I.
Unfortunately, the program also required a CODASYL compliant database
which was not available for the VAX at our site at that time.

I do not remember the exact problems but they were subtle uses of 
the language. 

The only company I'm aware of that has a PL/I compiler that may be
of any value is LPI (I do not have the address). Unfortunately, I
think their compilers only run under UNIX and maybe a handful of
other operating systems (But not MESSDOS).

DR's PL/I compiler is garbage. All "Subset G" PL/I compilers are going
to be worthless if you are transferring from an IBM mainframe compiler.

Digital Research's PL/I compiler was very screwed up. After buying the compiler
for $600 - $500, and sending in the registration form, they set a list of about
50 or more bugs with it. Things like A = A * B where A and B were floating
point numbers messed up the stack and you program would eventually dump. 
X = 105331 where X is an integer, would assign 15331, that is, the comiler
would drop 0's from integer constants from time to time. There were others,
I don't remember them all, I just could not believe some one would sell a
compiler for so much knowing it did not work and wouldn't give refunds.

If you have a PC you can run the Newdos80 Scott Adams adventures using
the Pc-Three TRS80 Model III emulator from Hypersoft (PO Box 51155, Raleigh,
NC 27609). However, it's not cheap (around 100 dollars or more). You will
also need a double-density, legal, MIII Newdos80 system disk (PC Three can't
read SD). Newdos80 is not CP/M compatible. There may be a further problem:
some of the Scott Adams adventures for the TRS-80 were distributed on tape,
but you could run them from a Newdos80 disk by using Apparat's LMOFFSET
program. A game doctored in this way for a TRS-80 Model I won't necessarily
work on a Model III (and thus on the emulator). A genuine disk version
should be OK. I have one (demo) SA adventure for the Model III, and would
be glad to hear from anyone wanting to give away unused copies of others.
 
I've had to sign off this list, so won't be around to receive comments.
 
(I wish there was a list for TRS-80 users, but I've never found one on the net.

Message-ID: <1991Jun10.211818.2869@imada.ou.dk>

Sometime ago I posted a request regarding CP/M emulators running on
un*x, and offered to summarize.  This is it and, alas, very short.

I only got information from D'Arcy J.M. Cain (darcy@druid), who
pointed towards

sipb.mit.edu	pub/druid/cp-emulate    (old info, cannot ftp right now)

which I have downloaded, but it won't run straight out of the box.

Anyone have a copy of DRI's MAC assembler lying around they don't need?
There's some software that requires it for assembly I'd like to tinker
with.
I have a Telcon Zorba (40 tracks, 80 sectors/track, 388K usable space)
and also a HP-125 DSDD 248K usable space. The former is 5.25" drive,
tha latter 3.5".
Thanks in advance.

CP/M-85 (disks and documentation), CP/M-86 (disks and documentation), MS-DOS

Does anyone have any documentation on the computer itself?  Is that bus inside

I have been reading this thread with considerable interest because I have
used each of the Digital Research PL/I implementations with varying degrees
of success.  DRI has a couple of grand of my shekels, bought 'em all, and I
share some of Jim's opinions but not all of them.

This could very well be the case with the DOS version, it was a hastily
converted derivative of the CP/M-86 version which was a hastily translated
derivative of the CP/M-80 version.  I found PL/I-80 to be a very reliable
and robust compiler that was able to do a lot of nifty things on an 8 bit
machine.  Even as we phosphor I have an application running on an ancient
IMSAI in PL/I-80, I installed it in October 1984 and there has never been
so much as a whimper out of it.  It's heavily overlaid but when you've only
got 64K for the OS and everyone on earth, it's to PL/I-80's credit that it
works as well as it does and overlays as well as it does.

I share Jim's feelings about the later "releases".  DRI just grabbed a
can of paint and tried to paint the horse and call it a zebra.  What was
especially irritating was (after paying them for "Professional Programmer
Support") to report a lethal bug and getting a letter back saying that
the problem was indeed reproducible but the product was "mature and no
longer in need of support".  The one that comes to mind in the DOS world
was when you went to the second level overlay having PL/I get it's FCB's
crossed and display your Access Manager index files as screens and use
you Display Manager files as AM indicies...

LPI just announced PL/I for RS6000, SPARC, M88000, i386/486
systems running UNIX as well as 386/486 running DOS.

The sheet says it's an ANSI PL/I X3.74 1981 General Purpose
subset and includes extensions for compatibility with PL/I
dialects for IBM mainframes, and DEC VAX.

Never used it myself, but looks like what you're looking for
LPI's number is 1-800-833-3678. I have no affiliation with them
just a satisfied user.

Actually, "Control Program for Microcomputers" (CP/M) was created to serve
as an O/S base for "Programming Language for Microcomputers" (PL/M).
[ Where PL/M is a subset of PL/I - not "close to full implementation" ].

However, CP/M became popular in its own right as a stand-alone operating system.

So the thought of running PL/M on CP/M isn't as far fetched as one would think.

Extract the two lines at the end of this message with your favorite
text editor, write them to disk as EXLPAT.HEX and overlay EXL.COM with
EXLPAT.HEX via DDT, DDTZ, MLOAD or whatever to produce a patched
EXL.COM. This should fix the problem wherein EXL-written disk files
whose filetype nominally have less than 3 characters have their last
character set to <null> rather than <space>, thus making them
inaccessible to other programs. I've tested this out and it works. Plan
to upload a EXLPAT.LBR with patch source shortly.

Subject: Help needed: Compupro 8/16 running concurrent cp/m
Message-ID: <15165@ucrmath.ucr.edu>

I'm having a bit of trouble with a Compupro 8/16; maybe somebody can help me...

I finally managed to get this thing to boot up, and it's now running concurrent
cp/m (and running it pretty well too).  Problem is, I have only one boot disk,
which gives me the heebie-jeebies.  No problem, I have two drives, make a copy
right?  Well, the copy program fails consistently; as far as I can tell the
problem is that it wants the two disks to have the same format (understandable,
though it would be nice if it would format them itself...).  Now, the disks
I want to copy are all double-sided, but all the other 8" disks I have come
from my imsai which has single-sided drives and so are formatted accordingly
(well, I have a box of blanks but they were pre-formatted...single sided...).

So, here's the core of the problem:  my format program will not (as far as I
can tell) re-format a single sided disk as a double sided.  I've tried taking
my most vicious magnets to SS disks but to no avail!  It's like the
computer KNOWS! Any ideas?  Also, anybody know where I can get reasonably-
priced 8" blanks?

Next question (as you can see, I have ccp/m but no manuals...), anybody know
what I need to do to make the hard drive bootable?  It's on a disk 3 controller
and was semi-bootable when I got it so I know it can be done (had to be re-
formatted though).  I've tried sysgen and a couple other things along those
lines with no success.

I guess that's it for now..oh yeah one other thing, I tried putting more than
1 meg of ram in but it doesn't seem to recognize it...is this a hard limit
or did I just blow the dip switches?  Thanks...

Hello,

Note, I'm not looking for a ``*.COM'' file that does it (I do have that),

It seems that the trouble I am having with Qterm's Kermit is not entirely
Qterm's fault.  I managed to use Qterm/Kermit to transfer some files on a local
bbs (m-net).  However I cannot manage it with MTS, the mainframe system I 
use here.  I have tried everything I can think of to no avail.  It just sits
there and times out merrily.  When I tried to send things to MTS I got from
MTS/Kermit the error message, "receive file header: unexpected packet type"
If any of you can suggest anything I would surely appreciate it.  Thanks.

Subject: Need info on Apple Premium Softcard //e Z80 card
Message-ID: <13440@uhccux.uhcc.Hawaii.Edu>

I am trying to create a qterm overlay for an Apple //e which uses the
Microsoft Premium Softcard //e.  This is NOT an "original" Softcard; this
model has its own 64K and built-in 80 column card.

I need to know how to call the ROM bios to read a byte from the Apple's
memory, and how to write a byte to the Apple's memory.  Unfortunately,
we do not have the Programmer's Guide to this card, and nowhere can I
find any overlays (for MEX, IMP, MDM7, etc.) that could be used as a
starting point.

This is a weird card -- it does NOT share Apple memory (with offset), like
the original Softcard.  If anyone can find this information in the 
Programmer's Reference, or from any other source, please contact me
via email.

Any hints appreciated.  Thank you.

My Amstrad PCW has a 3.5" drive. It's not standard, but the conversion is

Isn't that really PL/M?  Of course, that might be all that's needed.
PL/M is PL/I for [M]icros.  Anyone got a handle on what PL/C was

Are there any PD/Shareware PL/x compilers for MSDOS or CP/M?  Would
be neat to play with...

Greetings,

     I have a question about a NEC APC.

     I am trying to hook up a modem to that computer, BUT its port on the
back is no normal Serial Port, it looks more like the Centronics Parallel
Printer port (Cent 36 I think) instead of a DB25.  And I seemed to have
misplaced my manuals for the pinouts on that type of Serial Port, could
anyone give me some assistance??

     That way, with a little help from a Jumper Box and a normal Parallel
Printer cable, I could have Modem Communications.

                        Any and all comments are welcomed,

   Well, no.  More like "Programming Language / Micros".  It shares some
syntax with PL/I, but not even enough to be considered a dialect.  
Digital Research "PL/I" (not to be confused with PL/I) really is a

teaching language of choice, was associated with a largish collection of 
PL/I dialects and PL/I-like languages designed for various purposes or 
to illustrate various points.
  PL/C was a pedagogical subset that came out of Cornell (ok, now guess 
what the "C" stands for).  It lacked, among other things, BASED 
variables and pointers, which put in into the class known at the time as 
"FORTRAN with semicolons" rather than serious PL/I.
  A certain large computer manufacturer had a variation for systems 
programming work (more control of registers, etc.) that, for a while, 
was called PL/S but which was never released to customers and, as far as 
I know, never officially existed.
  There was also, if I recollect correctly (it has been a LONG time, he 
says, pulling at his white beard), one collection of PL/I dialects and
variants that were not named PL/x but SP/1 ... SP/K.  The came, if I
recall, out of Toronto.  If one could find the sources somewhere, it
might be pretty easy to put them up in a micro environment.

Yes, it *does* know!  If you will compare the double sided disks with the
single sided ones you will see that the sector 0 hole in the jacket for the
double sided one is at about 1 o'clock, whereas, the single sided one is at
about 12:30.  Make a paper template of the DS hole location and mark it on the
SS jacket - don't forget the back side too -  and with an old fashioned hand
paper punch a new hole in one side of the jacket.  Turn it over and do the
second.  Voila! a double sided disk.  NOTE!!!! Be very careful that you don't
scratch, fold, spindle, or mutilate the disk itself, AND that you DO NOT punch
a new hole in that also.  Just in the jacket, please.  Back before double
sided drives were at all common, they used to make 'flippy's' by a variation
of that technique, so that both sides were accessible.

Been some time since I played with 8" disks, but I seem to recall that
the sector index hole is in a different spot on double sided disks.  That's
how your box "knows" it's being fed single sided disks.

I have never seen QTerm, but Kermit-80 v4.11 does have a Microbee version.

Get a Microbee technical manual.

The microbee serial port is 4 bits of the PIO - TX, RX, CTS and one 
other non-standard one.  The other PIO bits are used for tape in, 
tape out, tape on/off, speaker.  Programming serial routines is a real pain.
Input is interrupt driven so that you don't lose characters when the 
keyboard is being scanned or the video screen scrolled.

I am still not able to get QTERM's KERMIT to talk to my local mainframe's

don't seem to do it.  MTS sometimes give "unexpected packet type" messages,
or spits out a "d:<cr>" at the bottom right of the screen, otherwise nothing
but timeout errors.  And they are offset on the screen by one line from
their labels, due to that <cr> at the bottom of the screen.

Bogus!  An 8086 is indistinguishable from an 8088 for all intents and
purposes.  Saying an 8086 isn't an 8088 and therefore not 100% IBM
compatible is equivalent to saying that an 80286 or 80386 is not an 8088
so therefor you are not 100% IBM compatible.

This is what may cause a problem.  The actual compatibility issues in 
PC-clone machines are related to hardware addressing and the BIOS
software.  If hardware is different, or the BIOS is significantly different,
then there probably would have to be a custom version of MSDOS for the
beast.  Note that the CPU has nothing to do with it (as long as it isn't
a 6809 :-)

	Not really very helpful, but...   There are a few other CP/
computers that use 3.5 inch drives.  We had a lot of discussion about the
Epson Geneva a little while ago.  That strange beast not only used 3.5 inch
dirves it also used Micro Cassttes, and roms...  If I remember right it
also used a 390k format.
	Yet one more CP/M computer that uses 3.5inch drives is the
painfully slow Commodore 128.  It ran CP/M+ on a Z80, would read Kaypro,
Osborne, and a few other 5.25 inch formats, and also was able to use a
proprietary 800k 3.5inch format.  Unfortuantly the drive interface was a
rather slow serial bus, so the machine was mostly useless.  If you have
access to one it shouldn't be too hard I don't think to teach it to read
the Microbee format (if you have a description of it) but you might find
it a little hard to find a 128, and the necessary 1581 drive.
	Good luck!  (Me, I stick with my Kaypro and my OSMs, no 3.5, but
then again not as much waiting :-)

I believe the copy program WILL format a blank, if it deems it

That's because your computer  DOES know the difference between a
SS and a DS diskette.  (Actually, the drive knows better than the
computer does because there are TWO index sensors on most, if not
all, DS drives.)  If you put a SS and a DS disk label side up
side-by-side, you'll notice that the index holes are in different
positions.  A SS disk will have its hole about a quarter inch to
the right of an imaginary line you could draw down the center
parallel the media head access cutout.  A DS disk will have its
hole about a 3/4" from said imaginary line. Translated: you're
shit out of luck trying to format those SS as DS disks.  Don't
try to punch hole in them either because it doesn't work.  It
will work with my Dynabyte, but not my CompuPro.

How many masters do you have?  On top of that, what version of
CDOS (I prefer it over CCP/M) do you have?  If you have more than
one, there should be several files, nameds depending on version,
which are loaders for specific controllers/drive types.  If you
have earlier than 5.0, there will be loaders for whether you use
a System Support 1 or a PC Video card as a console, and whether
you use 5 1/4" or 8" floppy or a Disk 2 or a Disk 3 as a boot
controller (Disk 2 and Disk 3 are hard drive controllers, with
the Disk 2 useable on SA-4000 (I think) interfaces, and the Disk
3 with the ST-506 interface.)

Nothing to do with the dipswitches.  Even if you're using a CPU
286 (like I do), you're still locked down to a 1 meg limit.
Those switches on your RAM cards will let you put up to 16 megs
of memory online.  BTW, are you using RAM 21 or RAM 22 memory
boards?  Just kinda curious.

If you have any more questions, gimme a call at (916) 344-5360
and I'll try to help ya.

Message-ID: <1991Jun16.073117.9326@netcom.COM>

Hi, everyone!
I've just recently got access to this newsgroup, and enjoy it a lot.  I have
an odd cp/m machine, called Actrix DS, that I use for word processing.  The
thing is a luggable (~30 lbs), has a built-in epson mx printer, modem, vdt
and 2 5 1/4 ds floppies.  It is extremely robust and reliable.  During 89
quake it fell of the desk and landed on it's "head", and still kept on 
working.  I have only one problem with it: it does not have a decent vt100
emulator.  I've tried qterm and imp, but both of these programs use an exter-
nal modem through a non-interrupt driven serial port, which means that it
looses characters at 1200 baud.  I've heard that there was a version of

   If you have one of the later coreboards (8342- I think, but don't quote me),
you'd be better off installing an 8530 and using that. This gets you two
hardware serial ports and, even though the 8530 is a real bitch to program,
it's lots better than the software UART. Don't know about QTERM, but there's
a ZMP overlay for this configuration.

Sydex, the people who created 22disk, also have a product out called AnaDisk
which does a fairly thorough and intelligent analysis of >>any<< disk 
format, CP/M, DOS, or otherwise.  Contact Sydex (see the 22disk reg. info)
for a shareware sampler containing the program.  The registered version of
22disk has a pretty good facility for creating your own disk format table,
and the instruction which come with the registered version give fairly
complete directions for the process.

Well, the computer does know if it is a DS or SS disk. On 8" disks,
its a hardware feature. Look at the index hole, and youll see that
the hole is shifted a few degrees between SS and DS disks. If your
feeling brave, you can use a hole punch to change it :-)

Try Inmac, or any of those mail order companys, they usually 
still sell 8" diskettes...

There is a version of Columbia's CP/M Kermit for the ACtrix but I'm
afraid it's not what you want. Somewhere, the rumor got started that Kermit-80
has VT-100 emulation. Let's be very clear: Columbia's Kermit-80 does
*****NOT***** have VT-100 emulation; it only emulates a VT-52/H-19 at present.
If this would be of use, you can download two hex files from Columbia's
WATSUN machine and MLOAD them together to make a running Kermit-80. Hope
this helps.

Small-C **does** produce files that are to be compiled with M80
and linked with L80 (at least Small-C from SMC211OB.LBR does). The
process goes somethine like this, assuming you've created file.C:
A>CC file -O
A>M80 file			;M80 reads file.MAC
A>L80 file,CLIB/S,file/N/E	;L80 reads file.REL and the C library,
				;makes file.COM
Look for a file L80-M80.LBR on your system; it has (somewhat cursory)
documentation for l80/M80. If you can't get it, I can send it via
E-mail, UUENCODEd.

<sigh>
Well, I now have Small-C, and it seems to compile things OK,
the only problem is, my copy of M80 is corrupt -
I tried assembling a test program (which clears the screen),
but it gave a 'BDOS error on P: Select' ....

(I had a *big* problem with the disk I initially got a copy
of M80 (& L80) on - after a spontaneous reboot, I found that
half the directory entries had been copied onto the other half !!
Needless to say, it was a late night (early morning ) before
I had even a hint of order about the disk (thank
goodness the Microbee has M/L monitor in ROM that can also
read/write disk (given track and sector numbers ... I have a question 
about this - see below ) ) )

Anyway, I would appreciate it if someone could send M80.COM and
L80.COM (preferably uuencoded) to dcook@spam.adelaide.edu.au ...

My question about track/sector numbers is: how do I map
the numbers in the directory entry onto physical track/sector numbers ?
(on a Microbee, CP/M 2.2, ZCPR )

Message-ID: <CMM.0.90.0.677183380.freeman@watsun.cc.columbia.edu>

Around 1982-1984, a company known as AVOS, Inc. modified first the 
Osborne I and then the Telcon Zorba for screen-reading via speech 
synthesis for use by the blind. At one time, there was an AVOS Blind User's 
Group. I am certain it no longer exists since AVOS went under years ago. If 
any modified Zorba users (besides myself, of course) read this newsgroup, I've 
got questions for them:
(1) has anyone else encountered incorrect disk transfers with AVOS 
BACKUP program, written by Donald Krantz? I have encountered files with 
altered CRCs (from CRCK) in the middle of a transferred disk 
(specifically, M80.COM). My copies of BACKUP have a CRCK44 generated CRC 
of 886E. (I'm now using CFU from CPYFSTU.LBR plus SGEN/SYSGEN for the 
system).
(2) Does anyone have the source to AVOS' Zorba terminal program 
STERM.COM? I'd like to see how they did their comm I/O and I might be 
persuaded to upgrade it to handle XMODEM-CRC, XMODEM-1K and True Ymodem 
protocols.
BTW, I now have a modified BIOS that doesn't destroy the index registers 
X and Y.
Thanks in advance.

I corresponded with Frank da Cruz (One of Columbia's Kermit gurus)
regarding this problem and he says that it's likely the problem is with
MTS-Kermit. Someone once told him that MTS-Kermit doesn't understand
I-packets and goes crazy when it receives one. Steve Graham may be SOL

Subject: CP/M-86 Problem
Message-ID: <9106181045.AA16324@LL.MIT.EDU>

   As a Boston Computer Society resource person (i.e., emergency problem
solver), I was just contacted by someone with a problem that I had no
immediate solution to.  Since I am about to go away on vacation for a month,
I hope that someone on the net will be able and willing to help this person.

   Ms Gale's father has been using his IBM XT clone for about ten years under
CP/M-86.  The person who set him up gave him no boot floppies (or he lost
them), and in the whole time he has never written anything to floppy. 
Suddenly the machine complains on boot-up of a disk error while trying to
read CPM.SYS.  Obviously, he would like to get the machine running again, at
which point Ms Gale plans to move the files over to MS-DOS.

   It sounds to me as if the CPM.SYS file has become corrupted (the
optimistic view) or that the whole partition has become corrupted (the
pessimistic view).  One obvious first step is to get from someone a bootable
CP/M-86 diskette that is appropriate for this hardware.  I've asked my
friends who might have had CP/M-86, but so far I have not found I copy.

   I have CP/M-86 for the ATR8000, but I doubt that it can work on a PC (the
disk is in an ATR8000 format that cannot even be read by Uniform or
MediaMaster).  I did copy the CPM.SYS file over to a diskette in another
ATR8000 format, which I could read on the PC, and I eventually got it onto a
diskette in CP/M-86 PC format.  I've sent this to Ms Gale; however, I don't
think this it will help her.  First, she won't have any way to get it onto
the hard disk, and, second, it may well be hardware dependent (I don't know
which of the OS components are included in this file).

   A second approach someone suggested to me is to run a program on the DOS
hard disk partition (the machine will come up in DOS) that can read files
from the CP/M partition.  The DEC Rainbow had such a utility, but I don't
know whether such utilities are available under generic MS-DOS or PC-DOS.

   Anyway, I hope someone out there can help.  If so, please contact Ms Gale,
as follows:

I'd be interested in hearing by email of any progress that is made on the
problem.  Thanks.

You cannot use DRI's assembler/linker assembler set.  You MUST
use the ZASM/ZLINK (like Small-C, it's PD).  You should be able
to find it on any well-stocked BBS, and it's also on SIMTEL20.

I believe you are refering to two versions of Small C.  Version 1.2 (supports
float and Z80) requires ZASM/ZLINK.  Veersion 2.1 (supports more control
structures and the 8080 but not float) uses a DRI like assembler.  It isn't
quite like the DRI MAC or RMAC because it declares global and external symbols
differently.

Both the versions of Small C are avialable from SIMTEL-20.

reply directly, but his address is too long for my mailer to accept!!!

>> Does anyone know if such a beastie exists either pd or commercially.

   There are several still available.  My wife's company, Sage Microsystems,
carries the famous BDS C (now in a special Z-System version as well as the
standard CP/M version).  The cost is $90.  BDS C is very fast and produces
very short, fast code.  However, it is not quite K&R and certainly not ANSI. 
The cost is $90.  We are about to go on vacation for a month, but if you
email me immediately with your address, we can probably get some info to you
before our departure.

   Another excellent possibility is Mix C, which I'm sure someone else will
tell you about.  It is very inexpensive and comes in both a CP/M and a DOS
version (both together are only $25!).  [In fact, I'd appreciate it if the
person selling Mix C would send me some of their sales brochures -- we'd be
happy to include them in information we send out to our customers.]

   I'm sure someone on the net will be happy to review the relative merits
and demerits of all the C compilers.  I don't program in C, myself, so I
cannot offer any first-hand advice.

Here's a backwards follow-up question.... I'm using 8" single sided drives, but the diskettes I found are doubles...  Someone mentioned punching a hole in
singles to use 'em as doubles, can I do the same thing with doubles to use 'em as singles?  If so, where do I put the hole?

Many thanks!

Yes, the reverse also will work.  (Even better, perhaps, because on a DS drive
it is sometimes necessary to cover the SS hole in the jacket.)  The SS hole
would be roughly half way between the DS hole and the vertical center line.
*BUT*, the only really accurate way is to make a template from a genuine SS
disk and use it to locate the hole.

Does anyone out there know of a terminal program that will handle 19200 on a
kaypro??  If so, then could you list its main features as I am thinking
about writing one (it already does 19200 without interupts!).

Also, does anyone out there have a kaypro 2 which has a greenish blue key
(I call it cyan) where the [ { key should be??  If so, what does CP/M
say at the top of your screen when you boot your machine??

Has anyone noticed that when you clear the screen on a kaypro that all the
screen attributes get turned off e.g. blink, reverse etc???

See ya soon.

Rather than punching holes in disks .... If anyone needs 8" single sided floppy

that I had to buy them all.  :-)  Needless to say, I have more than I need.

For that matter, I have more 8" double sided disks than I need too.

I have tried it at 19,200 bps, attached to the contty port of one of
our AT&T 3B2's.  It worked fine, as did MITE.  I also tried out David
Goodenough's UUCP for CP/M at 9600 bps -- it also worked in fine in
both directions.  I may have tried it 19,200 bps; if I did it worked OK:
I'd remember if it didn't.  By the way, I have a Kaypro 2X, so it has the
slow video.  The '83 series II's and IV's are supposed to be able to run
at least 1200 baud without using interrupts for the serial port.

Does anyone know if Mycroft still exists?  They also used to sell COMPAT,
a sort of UNIFORM clone.  I still use MITE all the time.

I have used MEX at 9600 baud quite successfully on my kaypro II. It
works just fine; it never retransmits a block so I knowcharacters are
not being missed. The machine on the other end is also a CP/M machine
running MEX. I may have a small advantage though; I have installed the
modification to run the Kaypro at 5 MHz. rather than the stock 2.5
MHz. I may also have an advantage in having a hard disk on the Kaypro,
but with the hand-shaking I don't think that should have any effect.
Both MEX and the Kaypro overlay are on Simtel-20.

Subject: TeleVideo 1603

 Recently someone posted a query about the TeleVideo 1603. I emailed
 a reply but I'm not sure if he received my message.  Just in case I'm
 reposting here.

 -----------------------------------------------------------------------

 At last, another TeleVideo 1603 owner to talk to...

 I see by your notes in CPM-DIGEST that you have been blessed ( or
 cursed :-)  ) by coming into possession of a TeleVideo 1603. Soon
 you will know the ineffable joy of sitting before your 1603 with
 your fingers in your ears while both disk drives are accessing ( a
 sound which would send other computer users running for a repairman).
 But, I ask you, how can you tell if the disk drives are working,
 unless you can *HEAR* them?

 Seriously, I've had a TeleVideo 1603 for about five years now.
 Except for the inability to run most programs written for the
 IBM and clone machines (MS-DOS) it's not a bad computer.  And
 no one is ever going to mistake it for an IBM.

 The TeleVideo 1603 is an 8088 machine running at 5 mz.  Basic
 memory is 128 k which can be expanded to 256 k with the addition
 of a memory board which attaches to the mother board.  It runs
 both CPM-86 and MS-DOS (2.0) operating systems.  There is a
 mono graphics board available for the CPM-86 os but not for
 MS-DOS. I would assume that with the addition of a driver
 this could be used with MS-DOS.  The problem is to find an
 old version of the Microsoft assembler to write the driver
 since, for obvious reasons, none of the current assemblers
 will run on the 1603.

 As you may have noticed there are three ports in back: a modem
 port, a serial printer port, and a mouse port.  I have a modem
 and serial printer attached to my 1603.  I've never seen a mouse
 for the 1603.  The manual says you can attach one, but I don't
 know if one actaually exists. (*)

 The disk drives are 96 tpi, 760 k.  Much larger than the drives
 that came with the original IBM pc.  They have been described as
 sounding like coffee grinders.  But, what the hell, you're never
 going to fall asleep while these babies are going.  The drives
 will read regular double density disks as well.  Along that line,
 I used 96 tpi Radio Shack disks when I first got my 1603.  They
 cost more than regular double density disks but since they were
 96 tpi, and easier to find than the other brands, I figured I
 didn't have much of a choice.  Then I ran into some bad disks.
 So just for the hell of it I bought some regular double density
 Scotch disks.  Not only did they format OK they seemed to work
 better.  That's a subjective judgement, I know, but I haven't
 had any problems since I switched.

 I have the operating systems disks for both CPM-86 and MS-DOS.
 I also have the following:

        For MS-DOS - 2.0 os disk, WordStar 3.3, Mite and TeleAsync
        communications programs, TurboPascal (2.1, I think),
        Datalight-C compiler (this works as long as you don't
        use the features that are specific to the IBM pc), dbase 2,
        other odds and ends that I have accumulated over the years.

        For CPM-86 - 1.0 os disk, ASM86, TeleCalc, TeleAsync, WordStar
        3.3, TeleWrite (iffy, I apparently corrupted the com file),
        another spreadsheet whose name I can't remember just now,
        some other odds and ends.

 I got the WordStar, communications programs, dbase, as well as the
 memory board, from Inovatek in California.  They used to advertise
 in Computer Shopper.  I'm pretty sure they're still around, though
 I haven't done business with them for a couple of years or so.

 I also have the MS-DOS, system/CPM-86, and tech manuals, plus
 the disk alignment disk.

 Well, I'm supposed to be working, so I'd better close.  Write back
 with any questions you have.  I'd like to stay in touch.


 Matt

 (*) After I wrote this I was informed (by Ed Grey) that a
     a mouse for the TeleVideo does indeed exist.

With regards to my terminal program
At the moment all it is is bits and pieces of my rom (81-278 or 81-299) code
thrown together to speed up the screen so it can handle 19200 and Ansi.  I
hope to expand it to Xmodem and Ymodem.  Also a phone number dialing thingy
too.  So far my code is (the com file) 2k long.  I have no doubt that this wi
go up quite rapidly as I add in X and Ymodem.  If I find out how to do it,
Zmodem is on the list too.  Has anyone else out there been able to setup
Zmodem under CP/M  (apart from Zmp which is too slow.)??

            *****************************************

The following information describes one of several C compilers 
available for CP/M.

The MIX C compiler is a complete implementation of C as defined 
in "The C Programming Language" by Kernighan and Richie (the K & 
R standard).  The C library functions provided are compatible 
with the Unix standard, therefore the programs written with MIX C 
are easily ported to other computers and operating systems.  MIX 
C is available for both CP/M or PCDOS and source code written on 
one is easily transportable to the other.

MIX C is designed especially for the beginning to intermediate 
level C programmer.  Unlike other systems, MIX C doesn't assume 
that you're a C expert.  With MIX C the 430 page manual includes 
a tutorial that guides you step by step through the C language.  
In my opinion the manual alone is worth the price of the entire 
package.

The PCDOS version of MIX C has an optional 'debugger' available 
called 'Ctrace.'  With Ctrace you can 'step' through your source 
code line by line or statement by statement, and see the results, 
which makes debugging a breeze.

I also have the MIX Editor for sale in both CP/M and PCDOS 
versions.  Among the many excellent features of the MIX Editor 
are the ability to work on two files simultaneously.  The manuals 
for the MIX C and the MIX Editor cover both the CP/M and the 
PCDOS versions.

The software is available on many UNIFORM supported 5.25" (DD) 
CP/M and IBM-PC (360K) disk formats.  I prefer to use TeleVideo 
(5.25", DD, DS, 48tpi) CP/M disks, since I use TeleVideo 
computers and therefore I can test the disk before shipping.  
Please specify your choice.

The price for each of the above software packages is only $20.00 
plus $5.00 for shipping and handling (UPS ground, in the 
continental US).  Orders shipped to a California address must 
include 7% sales tax.  If you order both the CP/M and PCDOS 
versions of either the MIX C compiler or MIX Editor the price is 
only $25.00 plus $5.00 for S&H (UPS ground, in the 48 contiguous 
states).  At this special low price only one manual is provided.  

Contact me at any address below for shipping charges outside the 
US (48 contiguous states) or for additional information.  Thanks 
for your interest.  Take care.

Subject: UZI-280 update
Message-ID: <4815@inews.intel.com>

Here is a more detailed description of the status of UZI-280.

First a report from last March:


UZI-280 is in the process of being written.  My computer system
now has a Z280 with 128K of memory.  The kernel and user processes 
now run in seperate address spaces, but total swapping is still used
at present.  The various hardware traps of the Z280 (privileged instruction,
system stack overflow, access violation) are handled correctly.
There is proper protection, in the sense that a user process cannot munch
kernel data, like in the original UZI.  Current plans include allowing
user processes to run seperated I and D address spaces (thus allowing
64K of code and 64K of data), and implementing demand paging instead of total
swapping.  UZI280 will then have the power and functionality (more or less) of 
a PDP-11/34 or PDP-11/60 running 7th Edition Unix.



Now, what I have done since then:


The demand-paged virtual memory is implemented.
However, the swapper still has at least one bug in it (it crashes 
when trying to handle programs larger than available user RAM.

Anyway, you get a full 64K shared code/data for your process,
and a full 64K for the kernel (lots more room for buffers, etc.)
The kernel does not swap, and currently ties up a minimum of
40K or so RAM. leaving me with at most 88K for user processes.

All the traps, segmentation violations, auto-growing of stack, etc.
work just great.  All system calls will trap on illegal addresses
passed to them, like they should.

The TTY driver is much better than that in the original UZI;
it handles the stty() calls that vi needs.

I have tested UZI280 with two terminals at once.

I have ported "stevie", the vi clone, now renamed "v8".
However the code occupies almost 64K, so it really needs
seperate user/data space to be useful.

The disk drivers are still not interrupt-driven.
One of the Z280 timers is used for the clock, and the
internal UART is used for the console, thus UZI280
is more hardware-independent than the original UZI.



Virtually all of the hard stuff for UZI-280 is done.  However,
I do not plan to spend more time on it myself, and I really
want to distribute it to people who can take advantage of it.

I moved a couple of weeks ago, and all my computer stuff is
still in boxes.  As soon as I have the time, I plan to
package and upload UZI-280 to SIMTEL20 or wherever.
Several people have expressed interest.

I will certainly also distribute my CP/M 3 Z280 BIOS,
and I would like to distribute my Z280 enhancements to
the Q/C C Compiler, if I can legally do so.

Subject: Boot disks for Kaypro 2 and Osborne 1
Message-ID: <1991Jun26.194925.2995@tc.fluke.COM>

I was wondering if anyone out there had a boot disk for a Kaypro 2? I got
one earlier this year at a local flea market (without software, naturally)
and am interested in using it as a portable typewritter (with a printer, of
course). If anyone has a system disk I could have a copy of (or purchase
<gasp>), please let me know. I am anxious to try out this beast.

Oh yes, if anyone has a boot disk for an Osborne 1, I have one of those that
I bought at an auction recently (without software - again naturally).

If you don't have either of these and know of someone who does, let me know.

Thanks,

Message-ID: <15736@ccncsu.ColoState.EDU>

HELP!

I have a Televideo TS-803H CP/M machine, running CP/M 2.2.

I have a hardware problem.  The machine originally came with a hard drive
and a single floppy drive.

The hard disk was cannabalized (I.E. MISSING) when I got the machine,
and although It runs fine off of the floppy drive, Whenever I turn
the machine on, I recieve a "HARDWARE ERROR: CONTACT DISTRIBUTOR"
or a "Booting from hard disk" message.

Once I turn the machine on and off and on a few times, it has no trouble 
booting from the floppy drive.  I was wondering what it takes to make
the computer realize that the hard disk is missing.

If anyone knows the answer to this question, 
PLEASE, PLEASE (grovel grovel beg) PLEASE let me know. It would be
most gratifying to clean up this annoying, if not life-threatening problem.

What do you mean by "uses a DRI-like assembler"?  Is this what 
Small-Mac is?  I've been using it for a while now, and it works well.   
What is this ZASM/ZLINK thingie anyway?

Wouldn't you know it, I couldn't find my Small-C book (yes, I PAID for 
Small-C... AND Small-Mac... AND Small-Tools too... GOOD STUFF!)
I don't know what version I have - may be a little out of date by now.  
But then, is Small-C for CP/M supported anymore??

  You should note that there is a definite syntax difference between
input for CP/M's ASM, and M80. M80 source files usually get the extension
".MAC". Also the object files differ (".REL" vs ".HEX"). M80's linker
can do a lot more than the standard Digital Research stuff.
  I haven't got the manual at hand, sorry.

>cref80
Creates a cross-reference listing from a special cross-reference file
plus the source file. The cross-reference file can optionally be created by
M80.

Never heard of this one before... a disassembler maybe???

Greetings!  
I have a Kaypro II that loses characters at speeds above 1200 too with most
terminal programs, but there is a simple program, FASTTERM that works at higher
speeds.  I'm told that this has to do with whether or not things are  
"interrupt-driven".
 
If you have access to the internet (which it doesn't look like) you can get     
files from Simtel by ftp, otherwise I guess you can get them by mail request
as discussed in a recent digest.

Is there a dip switch on the back of the machine?  I have a Televideo TPC-1,
which is supposed to be similar to the 803 (but no hard disk, and it's
"portable".)  On my machine, some of the dip-switch settings control baud
rate, one toggles the screen between green-on-black and black-on-green, and
one causes a "Boot Error" message if set wrong.

Servus Georg.
I've seen this msg a couple of times now but no reply (am I wrong - was
off terminal a while). Perhaps the only solution is that you disassemble
your decompressor program and find out what is going on.
I've been told that it (some) is written in C, so a disassembling might
cause just a triffle of a problem. In any case I'd like to know how it's
done too.
Maybe, if I got the time I can try to disassemble my GEL Uncruncher v2.6
before you...
So long for now.

You'd be much better off using Z8E which, IMHO, is the best Z80 
debugger I've ever tried.  Besides, you get source code if you
want your own custom mods, and above all, IT'S FREE!!!!!  Very
professional quality.  I'm surprised that Rick Surwillo (sp?)
didn't sell it as a commercial product.  It, like ZSID, is a 
symbolic debugger.  You can set up to 8 breakpoints (or was that 
16?) and tell each breakpoint through how many calls to run 
before stopping, you can bypass repetitive subroutine, and one 
thing that Z8E has that ZSID does not have is animated debugging. 
You may have to set up for your specific terminal, but it comes 
default for ADM-3A-type terminals.  It shows about 20 lines of 
your code and processor status above it.  And it puts a pointer 
next to the instruction that is about to be executed (*BANG*  
*THUD*  :-) ).  Plus, you can mess around with ports.  I have it 
on all the computers I either have or emulate a Z80 on.  Yes, it 
will work with Z80MU for the IBM, but I haven't tried it with 
22NICE.  Works well on my CompuPro 8/16's SPUZ (slave Z80 capable 
of running 4 tasks concurrently) with the main system a 286 
running Concurrent DOS.  It is the most resilient Z80 debugger 
I've ever seen.  I don't know where I'd be without it!!!!

If you're talking about the DB8/1 or the DB8/2 S-100 box, I 
believe you should be able to hook it straight to the box, 
provided you have a controller.  I have a Dynabyte DB8/1 on which 
I run a Fujitsu 20 megabyte 8" drive.  I have a spare 10 megabyte 
if you want it.  Also, by the way, if you indeed have a DB8/1 (or 
DB8/2, which version of the BIOS are you running?  Give me a buzz 
at the number below.
