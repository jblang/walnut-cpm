Hello all,
       I was wondering if comp.os.cpm is being archived anywhere? I've
been following the discussions on connecting 5.25 and 3.5" drives to 8"
systems and did not catch much of the earlier threads where detailed
information seemed to be given.
       Also, I have a Xerox 820-II with the 8" drives and was wondering if
anyone could provide me with the following information or pointers to where
I might locate this info:

       *floppy and hard disk subsystems: what is necessary, what can I
        use?
       *tech. documentation on the hardware, ROMs and anything else
       *pointers to firms that produce or market processor upgrades
        for the 820-II, like going to a Z280
       *anyone who has info on "homebrew" type alterations to this
        machine

       Thanks for any help.

P.S. Is there a Xerox users group anywhere in the Northeast or Mid-Atlantic
states?

You'll find all of the above rolled into one :) at Holly Park
RCP/M, 201-757-1497.  Dick Roberts, the sysop, will gladly sell
you his 8" hard drive kits, if you really want some extra heat in
your house :)  Chris McEwen also runs a BBS in the same area; I
don't recall the number, but I'm sure it's liberally plastered
all over Dick's system.

I own a hardworking Altos ACS8000 MP/M (multiuser) machine, which my wife
wants me to dump because it's taking up too much (guest) room.  I want to find
a good home for it with a fellow CP/M buff -- if they'll come to Santa
Barbara, California, and haul it away.

Here are the specs:

It's an Altos ACS8000 with Zilog Z80 microprocessor running MP/M II (V2.1).
It has an ACS 8200 Circuit Board supporting up to 4 concurrent users, with
208K of random access memory: 16K system memory, and 4 banks of 48K user
memory.  It has one (1) Single/Double density 8" floppy drive and a 14"
Winchester 40MB Hard Drive.

Also part of the free package is an Altos Magnetic Tape Unit (MTU-2, CMTD-
3400S2) to backup the hard disk onto 13.4 MB, 1/4", 450-foot, 4 track, high
density magnetic tape cartridges.  The MTU records data at 6400 BPI in serial
recording, Modified Frequency Modulation format, at 192 Kbits/second.

PLUS, a Televideo 925 monitor and TONS of:  manuals, 8" floppies, tape
cartridges, software on and off the hard disk --  a text editor, spell
checker, mail merger, accounting system, ADVENTURE, etc.

All for the low, low price of $0.  Just pick it up in Santa Barbara,
California, promise to love it forever, and haul it home.     -Craig Spirka

Subject: Kermit terminal emulation for CP/M

Is there a version of Kermit or Mex for CP/M on the Apple that does not lose
characters at 1200 and 2400 baud? I have an enhanced Apple 2E that I'm
using with a Datalink 2400 baud modem to download some CP/M stuff from
an IBM mainframe at the college. The IBM does not support nulls, and requires
VT100 emulation for full-screen editing. The CPM Kermit that I have is very old
(maybe 5 years or more) and only supports VT52. It drops the first 3 or 4
characters of each line at 1200 or 2400 baud.

I have the Apple Prodos Kermit (3.86), and it works fine, but I'd prefer a
direct CP/M Kermit or Xmodem that can read binaries directly on to CP/M disks.

Also, has anyone tried the MS/DOS CP/M emulators on an Apple PC Transporter?

Subject: C compilers which can be linked with Assembler (SLR for example)
Message-ID: <11736@uhccux.uhcc.Hawaii.Edu>

Dear cp/m addicts, I am looking for a C compiler. Not just ANY OLD C compiler.
I want one which generates code which can be linked into Z80 Assembler. Here 
is the problem: The monitor part of my BIOS (the thing which sets up the 
machine before booting cp/m) is currently written in SLR assembler, as is the 
rest of the BIOS. The amazing capabilities of the SLR assembler and virtual 
linker make cross-linking between BIOS and monitor quite easy. However, the 
monitor is getting longer and longer, and soon (with all the bells and 
whistles which will be required for SCSI disks as soon as I get the low-level 
SCSI driver to work, backup to SCSI tape, managing partitions on the disk and 
storing the setup of the machine in NVRAM) it will become a burden to write 
all this in assembler.

So I am looking for a C compiler with the following capabilities:
- ROMable code (that doesn't mean anything exceeding the following 
  requirements, the code actually runs in RAM),
- Generate fairly tight code (it all goes into EPROM, and 32kB EPROM isn't
  that much if a whole C run time library wants to get into that),
- Define subroutines and data structures at arbitrary addresses (so it can call
  assembler routines and access BIOS data structures),
- Call assembler subroutines with control over nearly all registers (so it 
  can pass and receive parameters from BIOS-internal routines),
- C routines have to be callable from assembler, and there will be no MAIN 
  program,
- Code can be generated at any address, and the position of stack and heap can
  be moved,
- The IO library can be replaced or modified (source code would be best), since
  no BDOS is present when the program runs all IO has to be through BIOS
  calls or assembler routines internal to the BIOS, 
- The compiler has to generate Microsoft or SLR type .REL files, because the
  linking has to be done by the SLR linker,
- or even better, it may to generate assembler source which can be assembled
  by the SLR asssembler.

Quite certainly my otherwise very nice MIX-C compiler will not do that. I know
of a few other C compilers (there is a PD small-C compiler on SIMTEL, and one 
in VOL224 or the SIG collection), I hear that some compilers are still being 
sold (for example by Jay Sage, or Aztek-C, and MI-C is still available for 
lotsof money in Germany, not identical to the low-cost MIX-C), and others may 
be defunct (C/80 and Quick-C come to mind). Are any available (frree, new for 
sale, or "used" someone wants to unload) which can fill these requirements ?

By the way, I am in no way restricted to C. I would actually prefer other 
languages like Pascal or Modula-2, but with those fancy languages the chances 
of finding a compiler whose output can be linked into assembler are even 
slimmer than with C.

For the long-term future (as soon as I finish my dissertation I might have some
spare time), are there any compilers which generate real Z280 code ? Or, for
that matter, even assemblers (I am not counting macro libraries which define
funny opcodes for the new Z280 instructions) ? That topic pops up every so
often. I hear of a few expensive cross-developments systems, but that's no fun.

Subject: Osborne 1 diskdrives. Help needed.
Message-ID: <1991Mar2.172851.669@fy.chalmers.se>

I have an Osborne 1 with diskdrive problems.

If I format a disk with 22DISKs cfmt in an IBM PC, the B-drive on the
Osborne refuses to read it. I get "bad sector"-errors each time I try
a DIR B: or a TYPE B:TEXT.FIL (the file is written by 22DISK). If I
use COPY to copy the entire disk to another in the A-drive, it reads
up to about track 30-35 and then says "read error".

However, the Osborne does not complain whatever I do with this cfmt-
formatted disk as long as I do it in the A-drive. I can read and write
without any problems at all. The A-drive also reads and writes disks
formatted and written on in the B-drive. The B-drive sometimes, but not
always, complain about A-formatted and -written disks.

I have tested this on the Osborne at several times with new disks and
using different IBMs, always with the same disappointing result.

It's very annoying not to be able to trust the B-drive. Therefore
I would be very happy if someone could comment on the causes of this disk-
drive behavior. What can I do about it? If it is misalignment, can I align
the drives myself? If so, how? (I have access to an electronics lab with
oscilloscopes, frequency-counters etc.)

                                      Thank you!

While running ZCPR on a Rainbow is quite nice, it's probably not that good
an idea. The Rainbow is primarily a CP/M-86 machine with a Z80 sidecar; ZCPR
only knows how to run Z80 programs, so you have to be willing to limit 
yourself to those if you want to run it on your Rainbow. I gave up on that
because the I/O byte didn't seem to work correctly; I couldn't get, e.g.,
generic CP/M Kermit running on the Z80.

However, it does make a fairly nice setup; the Rainbow has a huge TPA
because the operating system runs on the 8086 and therefore doesn't show
up in the Z80's memory space.

Caveat: I was running ZCPR 1.something or other that I had severely hacked
over. I don't know about running ZCPR 3 on the Rainbow.

Message-ID: <11664@pasteur.Berkeley.EDU>

My old reliable computer needs a new home.

It is an Altos model ACS 8000-2.  This is an industrial strength (big,
sturdy, and heavy) CP/M machine with:

	- 64k memory
	- 2 Shugart 8" dual-density floppy drives
	- 2 serial ports (one connects to a terminal as console)
	- 1 parallel port (centronics printer)
	- single board (no backplane)
	- CP/M 2.2
	
Comes with original manuals, schematics, and other detailed
technical documentation, as well as original packing material.

It also comes with OPRA 7.4. This is a version of CP/M 2.2 enhanced
specifically for this machine (but compatible with all CP/M software).
Enhancements include increased disk capacity, disk i/o speed,
interrupt driven type-ahead buffer, and others.

I also have other tools and programming languages with documentation.

Make an offer, any offer, and come take it away.  Alternately, suggest
a group or organization to whom it would be more benefit than trouble,
and I will consider donating it.

Message-ID: <39790001@hpcvia.CV.HP.COM>

I a have FREE CP/M machine available.  All I ask is that the recipient pick
it up at my home in Corvallis, Oregon.  

HARDWARE:
The system has 64K of memory and a 8085/8086 dual-processor.  There are two 
8" floppy drives (1.2M) and a terminal (Televideo 925).  There are serial
ports for the terminal and a modem.  There is a parallel port that is ready
to have a centronics printer hooked up to it.  While the machine was still
in use it shared a printer with a PC clone using an A-B switch.

SOFTWARE:
I have CP/M 2.2, Wordstar, Super-Calc, Dbase 2, CBASIC, CP/M-86 and a number
of other packages for it.  I  believe that I have all of the system manuals 
and most of the software manuals.

The system works fine.  It was taken out of service because my wife could no 
longer get companies to print checks for the accounting software she was 
using.  I hate to see this perfectly good system be sent to a landfill.  I
will take requests for the next 2 weeks.  Preference will be given to charit-
able organizations.  Please respond by e-mail.

Subject: NZCOM replacenet?
Message-ID: <39784@cup.portal.com>

A coupla years ago, or whenever, I purchased NZCOM on Epson QX-10
format. After I copyed the disks, I put the originals away, and 
didnt use them. Now, much time has passed, and when I tried to read
them, they seemed to have gone bad. Unfortunatly, I never mail in
those registration/guarentee/warrenty cards (if there even was one).
Is there any way I can get a (free) replacement?

Also, is the license of this software only valid for one machine? I
no longer own the QX-10, now instead I own a TeleTek System Master
with 8" DSDD drives...

Thanx

Subject: PacPerson needs home...

Hall-owww...!

As  some of you may have noticed, I began sending out a copy of
PacPerson to those who requested. The mistery is over; it is just
a cheap rip-off of Pacman and Ms. Pacman, with a CP/M touch.
Keep those requests coming, and they will be right on their way.

(One problem: the uuencoded file had as destination "M:PACPER.ARK."
I suspect this would cause a problem with some versions of UUDECODE
on a system without a M: drive. I haven't tried. If it does, simply
edit the darn file and get rid of the "M:"  The file is only 33K
long so most editors can handle it. Sometimes, learning to use
ED isn't that bad a deal...)

Now the sad part. I was just told be Keith Petersen (editor of this
newsgroup) that Simtel will not be accepting any more games and
will be deleting the ones that they already have (like Tetris).
So, I need a well-accessible file-serving place where these two
(PacPerson and Tetris) can be uploaded and to which I can redirect
far-future requests for those, and to which I can send more games
as I write them...  Some of you have already placed Tetris on the
BBS's, but I would like a "home base" for these games...

Any candidates?

  Thanks in advance, and enjoy!

Sorry, but you're SOL on that one if you have a
Microsoft/Applied Engineering Z80 card or any of its compatibles.
I tried to no avail to write interrupt routines, but I STILL lost
characters.  And this is at 2400+ on an Apple II Plus with a
Videx Videoterm!  The Apple CP/M system is a great system, but
this CANNOT be helped.  Please someone proveme wrong here because
I want the same thing.

As far as the PCT is concerned, it would STILL be too slow
because the PCT uses a 10 MHz V20 which makes the Apple a turbo
XT.  You could run Z80MU, but your effective speed would be
around 500kHz to 1MHz, so you'd be better off using a 386SX.  And
anything that takes advantage of the V20's hardware emulation
will let you use 8080/8085 stuff ONLY, which I think is too
limited, and what's worse is that I've heard is that the hardware
emulation is buggy.

You may find this an incredibly foolish question, but is there a CPM
emulator I can run on my AT? The reason I ask is because of a family
expense program that we have had from when we were running a z-card in
our Apple.........many years ago. I guess I would assume that any
emulator available would be in the form of software.

Please don't make too much fun of me. I had to ask!

Message-ID: <4740@ns-mx.uiowa.edu>

I have two Ithaca Intersystems DPS-1 computers for sale.  These are
high-quality S-100 CP/M systems with 20-slot motherboard, 25-amp
power supply, traditional front panel (lots of lights and switches)
and a chassis strong enough to jump up and down on.

Each one has a Z-80 CPU, 64K RAM, dual SSDD 8-inch floppies with
controllers, and all that good stuff.  There are also two serial cards,
a modem card, a 2708/2716 EPROM programmer, an S-100 extender card with 
logic probe, a sound-effects board, etc.

Software:  CP/M; Microsoft M80 Macro Assembler; WordStar; Vedit; DRI Tex
word processor; ZDM debugger; D80 disassembler; Forth; DRI PL/I; Ithaca
Pascal/Z; Microsoft Basic; lots of other stuff.

All software is licensed, original disks and manuals, etc.  All hardware 
includes schematics and manuals.  There are some books and magazines, too.

Both units were working when decommissioned.  One needs a serial card, but
the other has an extra, so it balances out.  Between the two of them, you
should have a complete computer and spare parts till doomsday.

No reasonable offer refused; you pay shipping.  Send email if interested.

I wrote a pair of drivers that allowed you to use ProDOS devices under
PCPI. One was for floppies and handled drives up to 2 MB, the other
was for hard disks and allowed up to 8 MB, but it had to be
non-removable (or you would have to make VERY sure to warm-boot
if you swapped. Bye bye data otherwise).

The trouble is that the vectors had to be sized in advance, so each
potential drive took up a k or so of your TPA.

All of the above is from memory. I could dig them up, but I'd rather
not have to. They're widespread, I would hope. :-/

They are ProDOS devices, no?

I think C86 is a commercial compiler, so you won't find a "free" version.  However
DeSmet C is now shareware or free, and it's excellent.

Since the APC runs MS-DOS 2.11, virtually ANY generic compiler will work.  I
still use the latest version of Microsoft C to generate code for the NEC APC.

  z80mu on a 20mhz 286 gives you about a 2.5 mhz z80, which is not badd
all things considered.
 
  you would be surprised at how much cp/m stuff is written for the 8080/8085
instruction set.  some z80 machines had problems with the extra z80 registers
because the bios would assume the machine was going to be used like
an 8080.
 
  running z80mu on a machine like a 386sx is rather pointless, especially
if you end up purchasing the machine solely to run cp/m stuff.  even though
i have z80mu, i rarely use it because it is not enough like a cp/m environment
just when you find that you need it to be.   not to mention i have a lot of
cp/m machine specific programs.
 
  if you want a solution to your problem, your best bet would be to spend
$50 to $100 or so and buy a used cp/m machine.  then you can get one with
a real serial port, that won't drop chars even at 9600 baud.

  'bag' solutions like a cp/m card in an apple are really not great solutions
because you are still stuck with a 'funny' disk format and strange machine
anomolies.  (like slow serial ports, wierd video mapping, etc. etc.)

Perhaps Doug Braun could elucidate on the subject because his UZI
package is written using Code Works' Q/C compiler.  Is it even
compilable under Aztec C, the Toolworks C/80 compiler, BDS-C, or
Mix C?  I would very much like to know.  Because if it's Q/C
specific and you cannot legally get the Code Works' compiler, I
will be extremely disappointed.

Yes, there are a few CP/M emulators in software.  I've used Joan Riff's
Z80MU (which emulates a Z80), and also one that came from Japan (which
emulates an 8080).  These were interesting, but not too useful to me.  The
emulator from Japan can be ordered through the C Users Journal magazine, for
$8.  It is floppy #284 -- "portable 8080 emulator" -- and it comes with C
source code.  I only got it partially working before I gave up.  Expect to
do some debugging if you get this.  Joan Riff's Z80MU works better, and is
public domain, but it is slow -- as all CP/M emulators in software will be.
Z80MU should be available in many MSDOS software collections.  (I heard that
a later version of Z80MU is being sold as a real, supported product.  If you
want the freebie, look for the "original" Z80MU.)

If you're serious about running CP/M under MSDOS, consider purchasing the
UniDOS Z80 coprocessor board.  But you may also have problems getting your PC
to read your old Apple floppies.  In the UniDOS documentation, it says:

   If your CP/M computer happens to be an Apple computer with a CP/M card,
   you should purchase MatchPoint-PC.  MatchPoint-PC will allow your PC
   compatible computer to read Apple II diskettes directly.  The standard
   disk controller in your PC is not capable of reading or writing Apple
   diskettes.

My old CP/M computer is a Kaypro, so I can't vouch for MatchPoint-PC.
I can vouch for the UniDOS Z80 coprocessor board.  I bought it for $170 in
August 1990, and it does everything I wanted it to do.  It is also quite
fast -- it runs at 8 Mhz with no wait states.

MatchPoint-PC and the UniDOS board are made by:

An ST-506 type interface is required.

Yes, and an interface card and controller, also.  What you will need in
the hardware and software line can be obtained from:
              Emerald Microware
              P.O. Box 1726
              Beaverton OR 97075
              503/641-8088    (talk to Brian)
They sell a kit that includes the interface card, controller, and
software (you provide the drive) for $245 approximately.  The drive can
be up to 40 mb.
 
To make the drive cold bootable, you will need to purchase and install a
new ROM.  Emerald sells the KayPLUS ROM for $69.95, or you can get the
well known Advent TurboROM for about $35 from Chuck Stafford,
916/483-0312.  The ROMs offer some other advantages also.
 
You WILL want to install a fan in the box!
 
>4) Do I need special software to format it?  If yes, then where can I get the
>software (I haven't looked too closely at the CPM archives on Simtel yet)?
 
Yes.  Obtainable from the same source that you got some of the other
things that you are going to need to buy.  See above.
 
>5) Is there a limitation to the size of the hard disk?  
 
That depends upon just how much money you want to spend.
 
>6) Can the harddisk be bootable?
 
See above.
 
>7) Will I have to give up one of the floppy drives?
>
Not necessarily, if you install a half high drive.  Definitely, with a
full height.

   Don't know about speeding it up: I have considered recoding the terminal
loop in assembler, but nothing definite yet. I am considering a VT-10*
emulation (and the fast loop would probably be necessary for this. Perhaps
Kermit as well, although I suspect most sites will have SZ/RZ by now.
   I'll probably get around to all this in a month or so, as soon as the
weather gets cooler (so I can get into the computer room again), and once
I fix my CP/M computer (which has a !@#$%^^&*&*&^ intermittent fault).

Subject: Wanted: Shugart SA860 drive info
Message-ID: <8713@gollum.twg.com>

I picked up a few SA860 drives as spares a while back; these are
half-height 8" drives, and as such don't have the nice hefty 110 VAC
motors found in canonical full-height drives.  Instead, these drives
look much like what PC 5.25" half-heights aspire to be when they
grow up, with a bigger version of the "flat" spindle motor and a 
quarter-turn handle to "close" the drive.

I now would like to use these to replace a pair of SA850 full-height
drives.  The problem is, these drives have a single power connector
that is different from either of the two on the 850s, and of course
I have no service or installation manual for the 860s :-(.
  
Does anyone out there have info on what the power connector expects?
Or, perhaps, pointers on where I could get the documentation for the
drives?  (Or even tales of terror about the troubles I'm asking for!)

Feel free to mail me; I'll summarize mailed responses.

Thanks in advance!

Hello CPM world.  I want some ROM chip carriers.  These gizmos (a pair of 
'em) came in the PX-* I got at an auction.  A 28-pin ROM or EPROM chip 
fits in it, and the bottoms of the pins get bent under and the chip is 
fixed.  The carrier has a kind of tiny handle on each end and what you do 
is grab it by those and put it in an extra-big socket.  The whole 
arrangement lets you change program ROM chips without fuss or static 
damage.

DOES ANYONE KNOW WHERE I CAN GET MORE CARRIERS?
 
If so thanks muchly...

Hello|

   I've juste bought MEDIA-MASTER v5.01 which now include a CP/M-Z80
software emulator... for PC XT or AT...
   It emulator either Z80, 8080 (software), and for which who have a
NEC V20 instead of a intel processor: 8080 (hardware)... because this chip
has a 8080 compatibility mode. (Does someone know how to enter in this mode?)
I've not fully tested yet but it speed... For example i've done in Z80 a loop
which take exactly 10 seconds on a Z80 at 4Mhz with no INT nor NMI...
On a PC XT (8088 at 4,77Mhz) with Z80MU It was taken: 147secondes, now with
ZPEM (MM v5.01) it takes only: 58secondes (for information on a commodore 128
in CP/M mode it takes 60secondes|||) I've also done the test on a 386sx-20
with ZPEM: only 7 secondes (so it's faster than a Z80 a 4Mhz|||)
   This emulator permit to acces I/O port... To acces RS232C for example (|)
And they have add a new Bdos fonction which permit to call any PC's bios fnct
   But it simply emulator a CPM22 (or perhaps a ZCPR because of the LIST cmd?)
           But it exist... Try it |       Bye| Alex.   <MONTARON@FRP8V11>

	Greetings. I got a Sol-20 Terminal Computer a few months ago

	based machine with a S100 buss. It came with 3 boards:
	32K SRAM, 16KSRAM, and a DiskJockey 2D/B disk controller.
	It also came with a box of 8" disks. 

	Anyways, I hooked it all up and after a few hours of the

	to boot CP/M 2.2! [wheeee ;-)]

	That's all fine but there is a catch. This system came with
	2 8" drives. Drive A (bootable) works fine but the analog 
	controller on drive B does not. That means that I can format
	a disk (I have) and I can SYSGEN it (have too) but I can NOT
	copy anything without drive B :-(

	SO!

	Anyone have a 801 (SSDD 8") drive lying around? I saw many
	at the "swapfest" but, at the time, I did not have this
	computer. My offer:

	$5 + shipping if you have just the board (under the drive)
	$25 + shipping for the whole drive (drive+board+case+ps)

	Next swapfest is in April so if noone gives any decent offers,
	I can wait :-(

	Please send e-mail with offer.

Greetings!  I have a monstrous old hard disk system (8", 40mb fixed and

The fool thing didn't survive the last move, and now I'm trying to get
it working again.  It's a nightmare of first-generation TTL gates.

If anyone out in netland has full schematics for this monster, or better
yet, a spare that they'd be willing to part with cheap (summer tuition is
coming up :-) ), I'd love to hear from you.  DTC doesn't even want to 
admit they ever made the thing in the first place, and the documentation
I have doesn't cover circuits or operation at all.  Can someone bail me
out?

(Just between thee and me, I'd *much* rather ditch it and get a nice,
quiet 3-1/2er in the 40mb range, but the wife'd pitch a fit if I did :-) )

Subject: Obvious Solution the Motor On
Message-ID: <"11-Mar-91 12:39:24 EST".*.Michael_D._Sprague.wbst311@Xerox.com>

Forget the AND gate to generate Motor On, forget connecting Motor On to Ground,
just forget all that sort of stuff.  The solution was so obvious that I am
surprised that I and others didn't think of it first.

I would have written this sooner, but due to the massive ice storm we had a
week ago, I only made it into work two days last week, and those were very busy
days.

Back Track:

This has to do with replacing 8 inch drives with 5.25 or 3.5 inch high density
drives.  The problem was that an 8" interface does not supply the Motor On
signal, and that many of the new high density drives do not provide a jumper to
tie the Drive select signal to Motor On.

I had suggested using an AND gate to provide the signal.  Zoltan Fekete had
suggested that the signal just be grounded.  Grounding the signal is not good,
since as long as a floppy has been inserted, the heads will be loaded and the
drive will spin.  As I prepared to make a new interface board (this one with
room to add an AND gate chip), I realized that even with this addition, both
drives will spin if each has a floppy, and either one is selected.

Then the solution this me.  Use an IBM type twisted cable!!!  This way, the
Drive Select signal could be tied directly to that drives Motor On, and nothing
else was needed (and you can buy them for about the same cost as it would take
to make one).  Since I had a spare twisted cable lying around, I modified my
old interface board, and it worked fine.  There is still a problem with drive
ready, but I'll get to that later.

In the IBM twisted cable, all wires go directly to the first drive connector
(drive B) and then wires 10 through 15 are twisted and installed backwards for
the second drive connector (drive A).  The ground wires all come out correct,
so this results in swapping positions for DS1/Motor ON and DS2/DS3.

On your interface board, connect the controllers Drive Select 1 signal to the
Floppy Interfaces Drive Select 1 (Motor On for Drive A) and Drive Select 3
(Drive Select 2 for Drive A).  The controllers Drive Select 2 still connects to
the floppy Interfaces Drive Select 2, and also to Motor On.

Both A and B drives should now be configured as Drive B, because of the twist.
Drive A goes on the end of the cable, after the twist.  The termination
resistor should now be in drive A, rather than Drive B, because A is at the end
of the cable.

Have an controller that supports 4 drives?  No problem.  Add a second 34 pin
header to your interface board, and connect as above, substituting the
controllers Drive Select 3 and Drive Select 4 signals for Selects 1 and 2.
Again, Drives C and D must be configured as Drive B, and a termination resistor
should be in drive C (which goes at the end of the cable).

Hmmm, for those who might have been lost by my "Interface board", you need a
way to connect the signals coming from the 8" drive controller to the 5.25 (or
3.5) inch drives.  I took the controllers signals directly using a 34 wire
ribbon cable.  That connects to a 34 pin wire wrap header on my Interface
board.  There is a second 34 pin wire wrap header on the interface board, and
that is for connecting to the floppies themselves.  Using a wire wrap tool, I
then connected all the interface signals to their proper pins on both headers.

Last, I mentioned a Drive Ready problem.  On my Chinon 1.2Mb drives, there was
a jumper to select between the Disk Change Function and Drive Ready on pin 34
of the floppy.  I set it for Drive Ready .... and it almost worked.  The signal
*IS* compatible with the 8" drive ready signal.  The problem is that my
computer times out before the drive is ready and gives me an error.  Since the
drive is still spinning (the drive spins of about 10 Seconds after it is
de-selected, in case you want to use it again), if I try the command again,
everything works fine.

Still it's a pain to boot twice, or type DIR, wait then tell it to retry.

The obvious solution would be to tie the controllers drive ready signal to
ground.  As Zoltan Fekete pointed out, this will probably work fine for reading
the drive, but could cause problems when trying to write to it.  I have had no
problems writing to the drive .... yet.  But I have not used the system enough
to know if I can get away with this or not.

The other solution of course, would be to modify the BIOS (I think) of the
computer so that it takes longer for the error time out when spinning the drive
up.  Sigh!

I assume that most of you who have done this conversion have just tied Drive
Ready to ground?  If so, how well has it worked?

The last address that I have for David is !wet!pallio!dg and is a couple of

Subject: Kaypro 10 backup
Message-ID: <901@adaptive.UUCP>

Greetings CP/M'rs.  I hope this is the appropriate place to ask these questions.
It was the only CP/M newsgroup I could find. We must be a dying breed :)

I just became the proud owner of a Kaypro 10, and I'm wondering if anyone has
any ideas about methods or devices I could use to regularly backup the 10M
hard drive?  It seems prudent especially in light of the firm warnings to use
"safety" before turning off the power.  I'm sure I'll forget that more than 
once or have a power outage while running sometime and I'd like to be able
to restore things.  I hope I don't have to transfer everything through the
floppy drive.

Also, while I'm here, does anyone know of a source for a PD C compiler for this
beastie?  

Thanks,

Casey Bahr

Does anybody know a current E-mail address for the author of the CP/M program
RDCBM.COM, which reads Commodore disks from the C128's CP/M mode?  I would be
interested in getting ahold of the source code for that program.  I tried the

There used to be a tom of PD stuff out there, but the sources have
pretty well dried up. I do have a copy of "Small C" for my Kaypro-10,
It's a real <PIG> though; slow, limited syntax, no include function
(recompile stdio.h every time, for instance....), and worse. I'll send
you a copy if I haven't thoroughly discouraged you yet.

   Think I wrote one in Turbo Pascal about 3 years ago, but I can't remember

       I recently posted a similar message to misc.forsale.computers, but
I'll ask here too.
       Does anyone have a disk expansion module (DEM) for the Xerox 820-II
that they'd be willing to part with for a reasonable price? I'm looking to
expand my system a little bit, and need the flexibility of the hard drive
and 5.25" floppy that the DEM would allow me to use.
       Oh, I don't need the actual drives themselves really, just w/o the
drives, but I'll consider anything...so don't me off if you have a DEM but
don't want to part it out.
       Thanks.

Howdy,

I looking for a replacement power supply for an Osborne Executive.
It was made by Astec, Model #9355 65W with 5v@5a, +12v@1.5a, +12v@2.1a
and -12v@.25a.  

While a direct replacement would be nice, any comparable ps with
equal or greater ratings would do, providing it fits in the case. (The
current one measures about 8x4x2 in.)

Any pointers would be appreciated.

Thanx in advance.

I wouldn't worry too much about using 'safety' unless you are in a big hurry
to shut down.  The K10 is set up such that when the '10 meg' LED is out, the
heads have been parked.  'Safety' simply does this before the time-out.

As regards backup, the floppy is the logical answer.  Sorry!

Well, I had that prob myself once.
Way back then, it was due to the packing format applied by who ever packed
the file in the first place.
	I have an Amstrad cpc6128 and found that sometimes, when you CRUNCH a
file you can UNCR it, but not UNCRLZH it. I know it sounds loony, but the
two programs are in fact different.
	Maybe you have them same prob here. I dunno.
	You might try to TYPE the file and look at the displayed content. If
you get something containing a string of text that looks like a filename within
the 100 bytes or so, it probably IS still packed - one way or the other.
	Perhaps your file is simply renamed? (probably tried that already, but
don't blame me for telling you the obvious though :-))
	Oh, another stupid thing I got worked out only last month is that
SOME people (Amsters) really use the PC's LHARC packing format to crunch the
files they want packed. I found that a small tool - LHRD - can extract files
from PC's *.LZH to CP/M standard files.
	If you still have a troublesome file then Kill The Bastard!

We'll come back to that later.

Message-ID: <XkeVy1w163w@austex>

I have a Kaypro 10 with a TurboROM and a Seagate ST-125 21 meg 3.5 in hd.
I used the Advent ADVFMT program to set up the drive, using a skew of 1,
the same, I suppose as an interleave of 1:1.  The drive access seems slow,
compared, for instance to another K-10 I have (my BBS) with a ST-251-1 5.25
in. 40 meg hd. Are there any programs out there that anyone knows of which
will give one information on the optimum skew for a particular machine/hd
combination.  The controller is the original Western Digital WD-1002.

Subject: K10 and a BBS?
Message-ID: <104098@unix.cis.pitt.edu>

	Greetings.

	I'm sorry to say that my CP/M days are numbered - I'm finally
	getting a 486 (with a 200MB ide, SVGA, etc :-) and I have
	to make up my mind on what to do with my Kaypro 10 :-(

	I can do any of the following (or you can suggest something
	else):

	1) I am considering getting a TurboROM (I know, I know... I've
	been saying this for a while.. ;-) since I already have a 30MB
	and the standard 10MB drive (40MB total) and run a BBS. We have
	a local BBS that has some CP/M stuff - something like 600K - 
	not much, really. I plan to fill up the drives with stuff from
	simtel - I already have all of the Kaypro and ZCPR 3.3 stuff :-)
	
	I have a nice ZCPR 3.3 setup and people have told me that it
	will be much easier to run a BBS on my setup that on stock
	CP/M 2.2 (anyone comment?) I just got the hang of zex and the
	wheel "business"... Anyways, anyone can recomment a decent BBS
	package? Space is not a problem but I would like the system to
	be "nice" to both the people who are seasoned CP/M users and to
	those who just got a CP/M machine for $25 :-) Anyone?

	2) Sell my K10 as it is - I'm thinking against this since I'm
	in the local computer club and there aren't that many CP/M people
	in the club (if I withdraw, there will be 2 :-) so I might just
	keep it to keep the group "reasonably" alive...

	3) Trash the K10 motherboard and put in a passive backplane
	with a CPU (IBM-on-a-board) card and a HD and FD controller.
	That way I have a portable PC... the floppy drive is IBM
	compatible, so is the HD, and I think I can get the display to
	work with a MDA card (if not, I can always get a CRT that fits
	and DOES work with MDA). If that's the case, the MB is up for
	grabs :-)

	4) Sell my K10 on the net :-( 

	I'm really interested in #1 - make a BBS out of it. I already put
	2 more 3 1/4" fans so I don't think 24H operation will hurt it.
	All I need now is the software. I'm open to suggestion.

	Take care. Please use e-mail when replying.

	P.S. I'll take a look at the simtel BBS stuff tonight and report
	on it's performance this week.. (well, _next_ week)

I have Media Master.  It's a *great* product for copying various formats
of CPM disks to MessyDos, but it's emulation of CPM was pretty poor.  I
couldn't get Zork to give a nice looking display :-)

I found Z80MU to be a much better product for emulation.

The latest version (the commercial version) of Z80MU also supports this,
although Joan recommends against it due to some (unspecified) bugs in the
8080 emulation of the V20.

>   This emulator permit to acces I/O port... To acces RS232C for example (|)

The commercial version of Z80MU also allows access to I/O ports.

I have not gotten the auto-install version of ZCPR to work with Z80MU,
because there is no real BDOS, just a funny little 256 byte trap
area.  I suspect that Media Master would suffer from the same deficiency(?).

Regarding Z80MU:

It is an impressive product.  I tried the commercial version and did not
like it, for a very application specific reason.  I actually run Unix,
with an MSDOS emulator, running the CPM emulator.  The new commercial
version of Z80MU has gobs of screen output with formatting and cursor
addressing junk.  Probably looks great on a regular PC, but in this
particular configuration screen I/O is expensive.  My application is
a database written many years ago when I was running CPM exclusively and
is too expensive to port.  I find disk operations are considerably faster
than the old 4Mhz Z80 floppy only system.  CPU intensive stuff is
noticeably, but not objectionably, slower than the Z80.  (This is on
a 20Mhz 386, under VP/IX).  Screen I/O on the Z80MU freeware version is
slow, but not painfull.   Under the commercial version it is just
unacceptable (Note that this is probably not the case running under
standard MSDOS where direct screen I/O is really direct).

BUT:

I picked up a PC BLUE Z80 coprocessor for a good price, and when installed
in an otherwise worthless XT I found an excellent CPM machine.  Running
at a full 4Mhz, combined with the XT's fast disk I/O and 40MB of hard disk,
it makes an excellent solution.  This is not really CPM, in that you work
at the dos prompt, and all normal DOS tools are available (such as a
real 'make' which I never had under CPM, and real date stamping, etc),
while the CPM programs automatically run under the coprocessor and exit
back to dos when done.  The real disadvantage is that I have to work on the
XT machine instead of the much preferrable Unix machine.  Now if I could
just get a coprocessor that would run under Unix, I might have the 
perfect setup :-)

YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY DEAD WRONG!!!!!!


I USE UCRLZH.COM TO UNCRUNCH ?Z? FILES ALL THE TIME!!!!!!

IF YOU WANT TO MAKE ME EAT MY WORDS, TRY IT!!!  I know I'm right

UCRLZH11.COM _WILL_ uncrunch ?Q?, ?Z?, and ?Y? files.  What you

Sorry about that.  I had to get you with this one with the
fullest possible permissible setting on my flamethrower without
cussing (if it WAS permitted, I would have said and/or called you
some real doozies).  Mainly because I use the program ALL THE

And YOU don't really know what you are talking about.  I have had the
same problems as Klaus has had -- I also own a CPC6128.  The problem he
describes is exactly true, for the CPC6128.  There is a bug (somewhere)
in the Bios. I am going to have to go reverse-engineering it (there is
no Bios source available to my knowledge).

FTR, I have successfully used UCRLZH to uncrunch files (.?Z?), so it
definately does work.  This was not off the floppy drives on the
Amstrad, however (this is where the bug is).
 
So the real answer is that you are both right....  :-)  Sortof.

If you own an Amstrad, and you haven't had any problems, I would love to
hear what you do.  Otherwise, YOU don't know exactly what you are
talking about.

May I suggest, in future, that you don't jump in with all guns blazing
(to mix metaphors), and instead find out why the person made the
statement?

Also, FTR, the reason that one program works (UNCR), and another doesn't
(UNCRLZH), seems to be connected with the amount of register
preservation they do, the amount of use they make of the extra Z80
registers, what they actually call, and a few other things.

For instance, unzip (David Goodenough) doesn't work too well on the Amstrad
drives for some reason.  It works fine off my Ram disk (the patch for
which appears to have been made (autoinstall program) at a higher level
than the bug) however. [BTW, this is nothing against David's program --
it SHOULD work perfectly on the Amstrad, and does on other systems]

Unarc (I forget who wrote it at the moment), on the other hand, works
perfectly.  I looked through the source, and saw lots of places where it
used the extra registers very carefully, and preserved them all the way
through (interupts off), etc.   The comments mentioned problems with
extra register usage on "various computers".

Further information, (for those with advice rather than flames!), it
appears that everytime this bug occurs the same piece of code/whatever
is copied into the disk-sector buffer, rather than the sector required.
Only 128 bytes long, but morethan enough to scamble anything that is
supposed to be being decompressed.  I discovered this when one of my editors
(ZDE - I don't have any source to check what it does) had the same problem.  

One more little thing to note, the problem doesn't occur all the time,
and as far as I can tell it happens at random.  This cannot be true, but
I haven't discovered what causes it yet.  One possible lead is that
sometimes a file will fail, and then if the operation is tried again
after resetting the drives, it will work.  [This is CP/M+, BTW, the
drives are supposed to auto-reset when needed]

Sorry, everyone, that this has got this long.  It was intended to rebut
the flame, but the opportunity to seek others opinion on the problem
couldn't be missed.

Any useful suggestions are welcomed, and any off-the-cuff flames will be
dealt with in a suitable manner (ie, probably ignored!).

This is CP/M, not Mess-Dos.  I've never seen ANY comms program for CP/M
bigger than about 40K or so, and that is MEX1.14, which does all sorts
of tricks.  I suspect that just about any program you pick will fit on a
64K ROM.  I'd suggest trying MDM7XX, for which the full source is (or
was, ca 1984) available on SIMTEL.  You can always cut out things you
don't want.

	Just to throw my own 2d in, if you are looking for term programs
for CP/M that you can readily find source to, you might want to try Kermit.
I know the source is availabe, that is how it is distributed.
	I have the 4.0 source, and I have modified it to work with some of
my stranger machines, so it is VERY flexible that way.
	The only problem I can see, and this applies for most of the other
programs too, I think, is that most of the CP/M programs that I am familiar
with don't maintain the strict segregation of code and data space that is
essential if you are going to run the prog off of the ROM.  You may be
forced to move the entire routine to RAM as part of your startup, and then
page the ROM out.  The only other alternative is going through hundreds of
K of assembler source trying to movde all of the data stores to wherever in
your memory map you have some RAM, not my idea of fun.
	Good Luck!

"thats garbage" on a few of them.

	DTC 10-1 sasi/scsi host adaptor.  
	Dual Dmem 256k memory card
	Dual Emem 1M memory card
	UCI Easyram 2M memory card
	CCS streaming tape interface 
	JB systems fd/sasi interface
	JB systems Z80 slave processor
	DPC-180	looks like 64k z80 slave board
	CCS 4 port serial

I've got docs for just about all morrow and compupro cards, so if
anybody has a need for that kind of thing, get in touch.

My deepest apologies.  I guess I assumed that all BIOSes were
pretty much well-behaved and it seems to be restricted to some
BIOSes.  Also, it probably has something to do with the fact that
those computers are running CP/M Plus, which I've heard can be
flakey at times.  That's why I stick with my CP/M 2.2 stuff
(highly uprated w/ZCPR33 and stuff like that...)

Two turn interrupts on and off, one deals with memory mapping
(the Z80 card remaps the system's memory rather radically to take
into account that Pages 0-3 are sacred to the 6502, but you can
alternatively switch that mapping off to make the Z80 see it as
the 6502 sees it; for CP/M to work properly, you MUST turn
mapping on because you don't want the 6502 and the Z80 throwing
each other curves... (grin).  Also, the point needs to be made
that the card in question, the Softcard, distributed by
Microsoft, as in the ORIGINAL Softcard, not the Softcard //e,
talks DIRECTLY to the Apple hardware just like the 6502 does.  In
fact, when the Z80 has control, it puts the 6502 to sleep (I
believe it does nothing more than execute wait states).), and the
remaining one controls how the card interfaces to the Apple DMA
daisy chain.

The switches are like this:

      sw1    sw2    sw3    sw4
     MEM MAP DMA   IRQ/INT NMI  <--- SAME ON BOTH
             DAISY  ^   ^
             CHAIN  |   |_ Z80  NAME
                    |_____ 6502 NAME

Sw1:   On:  Disables memory remapping
       Off: Enables memory remapping (Apple CP/M default)


Sw2:   On:  When DMA daisy chain input is dropped low, the Z80
            will drop what it's currently doing to let a
            high-priority device do some DMA and relinquish
            control back to the 6502
       Off: Won't stop at all no matter what priority device is
            requesting DMA

                            ___                          ___
Sw3:   On:  Hooks the Z80's NMI line up with the Apple's NMI line
            on the expansion bus so the Z80 will be interrupted
            upon receipt of a non-maskable interrupt.  The
            Softcard recommends that interrupts, maskable or not,
            should be handled by the 6502 which also sees the
            interrupt, so it can clear its interrupt status and
            return control back to the Z80.
       Off: Disconnects the line.

                            ___                          ___
Sw4:   On:  Hooks the Z80's INT line up with the Apple's IRQ line
            on the expansion bus.  Discussion is the same as
            above.
       Off: Disconnects the line.

The default settings for the switches should be all of them off
for Apple CP/M to work properly.

LUX will deal with libraries too, but they're designed for
RCP/M's.  To extract the LBR's contents (provided they're not
compressed), type "-x" and then a drive/file specification, most
often times the file specificaiton will be "*.*" to extract
everything.  If you were to type "-x b:*.*" at the NULU prompt in
an open library, that means to extract all the files to drive B:,
but it won't unsqueeze the files if they're squeezed (those
files, often times, will have a "Q" as the second letter of the
file's extension).  For those files, use "-q" instead of "-x".
To unsqueeze all files with Q as the second letter of the
file type, type "-q b:*.?Q?" which will unsqueeze (or try to) all
files with the letter "Q" as the second letter in the file type.
Most CP/M programs with multiple files are in the .LBR format,
but there are the occasional .ARK, .ARC, and .ZIP files.

As I said a couple of paragraphs ago, they were distributed by
Microsoft.

If you have used CP/M on other computers, then using CP/M program
on the Apple will be more or less the same as you have used them
on, say an Osborne, a Kaypro, an SBC, or an S-100 box.  However,
if you plan to do a lot of stuff between operating systems,
particularly in ProDOS, I very much suggest that you get a
program called "Chameleon" which runs under Apple ProDOS and will
transfer between all four major diskette formats, i.e. DOS 3.3,
ProDOS (you'll need this to run Chameleon), Pascal (it will only
support the 5 1/4" variety, I believe), and CP/M.

Have fun!

 NULU will also allow you to extract the member files. Use the -H

 A library file is simply a method of grouping certain files together 
into one file for transfer or storage. Often the files are also

 All read & write disk access pass throught buffer (see BCB=Buffer Control Blk)
 There's at all 32Ko of buffer (as tou can call cache disk|) located on bank
 number 2 if i remember well. If the patch of the ram-disk alter this area it
 will bug when CPM attempt to save this block (perhaps it's the patch itself|)
 Because ^C flush (but not save) all buffer to disk...
 I think the answer is near | Make a list of BCB, search buffer & verify
 content of all buffer... to solve the bug you have to minimize buffers...
 It's my opinion... What do YOU thing of this ?

Subject: Help with Kaypro terminal emulation
Message-ID: <905@adaptive.UUCP>

Sorry if this belongs in the FAQ file.

I'm trying to use a modem communications program on my Kaypro 10.
It appears to be a derivative of MDM730 (sic?).  The on-line
documentation, however, doesn't give me a clue as to what type of
terminal it's emulating, which is where I'm having trouble.  Somewhere
else in other documentation I remember seeing that the Kaypro emulates
a Lear-Siegler adm3a, so that's how I've tried setting the termcap
on the Unix (Sun) machine I'm trying to connect to.  Everything
except vi seems to be working ok (TERM and TERMCAP in my environment 
look right for an adm3a).  In vi I get a garbled screen that
makes editing pretty difficult.  I remember long ago using a Kaypro II
and I think the same comm. pgm., but I don't remember how I got around
this problem.

I'm pretty illiterate in this area, so I'm hoping someone in this
group can enlighten me or provide some heuristics to getting the
termcap set properly.  Or maybe direct me to a different comm. package.
I do have a printed document for SUPRTERM, which says it emulates an
adm3a, but I can't find that software on any of my disks.

Thanks in advance,

Your apology is accecpted.  I have heard a fairly large number of BIOSes
which have problems with various things - most written for Z80 machines
in the days when 8080 code was the most common, so they assumed that
they had the extra registers to themselves.  This is no longer true.
 
I doubt that the fact they are running CP/M+ has anything to do with it.
CP/M+ seems okay to me, most of the time. Occassionaly it fails to relog
in a disk, but that is only because of the way it detects a new disk
(directory checksumming).  No where near as much hassle as logging in
disks under 2.2!
 
The trouble with the Amstrad implementation of CP/M 2.2 is that they
used a graphics screen (all the machine has - bit map 16K), which steals
most of the useful memory.  There is only about 42K TPA - hardly enough
to do anything.

I've never heard of that one.  Who puts that one out?  I would
like to kick the tires on that one.  As for the "HALT"
instruction, it does seem a logical way to write a software
emulation of the BIOS.  As for how MS-DOS picks it up, curious
how that would work.  Nick Sayer wrote someting similar, but this
is under UNIX.

You might want to try either Emerald MicroWare (whose address I
could go and snag) if anyone wants it) or any type of controller
that plugs into the Z80 slot.  Most of these controllers come
with software that will talk to the hard disk no matter what kind
of machine it's running on.  I've seen such a setup which even
comes with source code for its BIOS so it's possible for me to
get a system like this for my Ampro (for which I have source for
its BIOS _AND_ main ROM) such that the entire BIOS which will
talk to both hard and floppy disks is entirely self-contained,
and can even boot from the hard disk and not have to boot only
from the floppy and manually (or semiautomatically) run a hard
drive initialization program (not format, but put routines up so
the system can talk to the hard drive).

Gads, you have me salivating!!!!!  I know this part of the
message belongs elsewhere, but I thought I'd ask this:  Will it
be available in the US?  If so, that could finally put purely
UNIX machines in the hands of commoners.  Then I could gloat as
my pro-MESSY-DOS friends are dumbfounded of what it could do.

I'm looking for a  8080 macro cross-assembler to run under unix.
Our site had a program called zmac, which is fo Z80 and the manual
page says:

     The Zmac assembler is modeled after  the  Intel  8080  macro
     cross-assembler  for  the Intel 8080 by Ken Borgendale.

So does anyone know the name of this program, where to get it from 
or how to contact Ken Borgendale. The only thing left of zmac here
is the manual page, so I can`t check the sources either. So finding
a ftp site that has zmac would propbaly help me a lot.

Please respond by mail. And please note that this article is a crossposting.

Message-ID: <1991Mar23.023510.3540@gn.ecn.purdue.edu>

Is there a version of Kermit for the Commodore 128 that will support 9600
baud?  The c128 can support 9600, but the version of Kermit that I have 
runs in the 64 mode, and only goes up to 2400 baud.  Kermit is the only 
file transfer program that works with my UNIX account.

By the way, I have never really used the cp/m mode of my 128, so I would
need some way of running cp/m Kermit off of Commodore formated disks. I
have no problem downloading binaries in 64 mode, except that it is very
slow.  My system includes a c128, 1571 drive, and an 80 column monitor.
Thanks in advance,

<boB<

I have previously posted to this newsgroup the information that the TurboROM 
for the Kaypro CP/M computers is available from Jay Sage (Sage Microsystems 
East).  This is incorrect.  Jay Sage does NOT sell the TurboROM.  TThe 
Advent TurboROM for the Kaypros is available from Charles B. Stafford, 4000 
Norris Ave., Sacramento, CA  95812, phone 916-483-0312.  He has bought out 
the stock from the now defunct Advent Corp. and is marketing it from his

I need to know what kind of Z80 card you're using.  If you're

To my knowledge, all of the public domain communication packages use overlays
to tailor them to a particular computer.  Therefore, if your MDM730, or
whatever, runs on your KP-10 there is a very high probability that it has the
Kaypro's ADM-3 emulation built in.  

If it would be useful to you, I could uue Superterm and send it off to you. 
However, in my opinion it is a less desirable program.  Of the old standbys,
my personal preference would be for MEX114.

The Kaypro uses a superset of the adm3a terminal commands.  The kp
enhancements make it much easier to live with, as the adm3a is
rather simple minded.  To help a little, here's the kaypro termcap
file that I've been using for several years.  Converting it to
terminfo is easy enough with captoinfo.

Subject: Osborne Executive printing problems
Message-ID: <16243@reed.UUCP>

I've been having a major problem with my Osborne Executive since I acquired
it about three years ago.  I had been able to work around it for awhile,
but about two weeks ago said problem became very pesky, and the other
people using the machine haven't been able to work around it since then.
(I've been separated from the machine by an ocean and one and a half
continents for about two months.)

The problem is this: printing.  The Executive (ROM 1.21, BIOS 1.2 Enhanced)
had never properly loaded the printer information on boot-up from SETUP.COM.

Specifically, what was connected to the CENTRONICS port: no matter how it
was permanently saved, it would respond NONE when I asked to see what the
settings were in memory.  (When I asked it to show the settings from drive
A, it would invariably inform me that the printer was connected and was
presumably ready.)

As a result, whenever I wanted to print, I would have to exit the program
(usually WS), load SETUP, load the information from the drive into memory,
exit SETUP, reload the other program, and print.  This would work for as
long as I did not reset or shut down the computer.  This worked for quite
a while, and wouldn't waste much time.

However, this doesn't work anymore.  Now, after twiddling with SETUP so that
it recognizes the printer, the Executive will refuse to load any other
program, and will crash violently.  (This problem began with PrintMaster
(which could be worked around) but spread to WordStar (fatal).)

I've tried to fix the original problem many times, playing with SETUP, alt-
ernating BIOS versions (despite the other printing problems, such as
the notorious "Unassign this device?"), and am now at wit's end.

Any suggestions?

Message-ID: <8555@mentor.cc.purdue.edu>

  I think you can get zmac on simtel20 under unix-c. It's not same syntax as
Microsoft M80, or DRI MAC. 
  There was an 8080 macro assembler written in small-c by Hendriks ????
called  SMAC or some such, that was m80 compatible and produced relocatable
code. As far as I know, zmac only produced hex and binary.
  If you're not committed to emulating some particular cp/m assembler,
the macros can be done under unix with cpp or m4, so the essential piece is
the assembler itself.
  Yet another suggestion is to run a CP/M emulation under unix. You lose a lot
of CPU speed, but for assemblies the diskio may dominate anyway.
  To see how this works, rlogin in as "cpm" at hopf.purdue.edu.
This kicks you into a cp/m 2.2 emulation program. Change to drive B: and run
"mac bios "  to get an idea of how fast the emulation is for your purpose.

Oh, no, it is not just anything else.  It is always the same.  I had a
360K file which I was reading through after putting it through a naughty
program (text file, BTW).  There were 15 problems in it (15/2000 or so
is not too bad, but not too good).  Everytime there was the same string.
Always.  This has happened in the past.  The string includes some NULLs
(0), as well, but basically starts like this
"s^L^s|FF|FFx@ff<fff<<`<....".   Everytime.  Most annoying.  It also
makes me think that it is actually program which is being put in,
probably because someone failed to save a register, or something.

This is interesting. I haven't been able to test it without the ram
disk, because I have had the software installed for ages (and it is hard
to test for something which is intermittent).  At one stage I did think
that it was something to do with the patch put on for the ram disk, and
I started disassembling that.  I ran out of time (near end of year, and I
am a student....:-(  It looks as though I should go back to this.
Thought -- how old is your CPC?  Mine is a model A.  I wonder if this
has anything to do with the problem (ie, a bug fix in later versions?).

This sounds like what I was thiking of, although I hadn't got as far as
exploring the buffering.  If you are able to do what you are suggest
please do so.  For my part, I will continue my disassembly of the patch.
dk'tronics are too far gone to be able to fight about the reverse
engineering, or help with a bug fix.

Indeed it is sad. What do you have which talks about the BIOS?  We
really need something which talks about the Amstrad BIOS, or better
still a disassembly.  I will ask someone who does a lot of CP/M
programming here if they have any good books.

Anyway, I am pleased to see that I am not alone.  This also tends to
suggest to me that I was on the right track disassembling the patch for
the silicon disk.  If I can only find the disk it was on (1 of about
200....) I will go back to it. 

BTW, are there any other Amstrad CPC owners out there with this
problem?

Voila! Non-standard system. I have an Amstrad CPC 464 with 512K 
banked RAM, and the 6128 ROM. I have used David Goodenough's 
UNZIP program every day for the last 9 months without a single 
problem, even with 200K ZIP files.

I have just tried UCRLZH11 on a ?Q?, a ?Z? and a ?Y? file with no 
problems.

May I hazard a guess that you're running ZCPR or similar, or 
something else non-standard?

Hi, Lindsay!  Just thought I'd interject this; I know Chuck
myself, and if you want to send a message to him (he is presently

Yes this is wrong place, but the thread has already started.  The C900
seems to be one of many Commodore European orphan machines, if you are
interested in UNIX then look to the Amiga 3000 UX, this machine is based
off of the Amiga 3000 68030 platform, is already in final beta stages, and
is the first machine out there to run UNIX SV r4.  Drool drool drool!!!
	I have talked with a Commodore rep and supposedly it will sell with
the entire UNIX package, X.11 and I think it was open look, NFS(TCP/IP), an
ethernet board, a 200 meg hard drive and either 6 or 8 megs of ram for well
under 10,000.  The system also will support the 24bit color card that is
coming out soon...

By the way, it will also turn into an Amiga 3000 with just a slightly
different boot up procedure (you use the mouse to pull up a boot menu and
click on Amiga or UNIX for what you want).

This isn't a chep machine, but it is a nice looking low end workstation,
and it blows away anything I have seen in the Mac arena...

Subject: Amstrad BIOS problems -- Moderately Long
Message-ID: <1991Mar27.094731.17147@actrix.gen.nz>

[To those who are not interested in the nitty gritty of a fairly
annoying bug in a patch to the Amstrad Bios, please skip this message
now.  Anyone else, feedback is very welcome to ewen@actrix.gen.nz, or to
this group]

After seeing various peoples thoughts about what the problem with the
Amstrad BIOS which causes certain programs not to work properly, I did
some experimenting with my Amstrad.

The hardware concerned was an Amstrad CPC6128, with serial interface,
512K of extra ram. For the entire of the test, I used David Goodenough's
unzip program (wonderful program, despite the problems that Amstrad
has), and a 20K Zip file which I picked up somewhere.  

The first thing I tried was removing all my extra hardware, and using
the original boot disk.  Unzip from A to B drive, worked fine.  The next
thing was to reintroduce the hardware.  The Unzip still worked fine.  I
then went back to my normal boot disk (with silicon disk patch), and
tried the same thing.  It worked fine.

Then I started experimenting with variouus combinations of drives, and
came up with the following results:

	ZIP file	Output file	Error?
	A		A		No.
	A		B		No.
	B		B		No.
	B		A		No.
	C		C		No.
	C		B		No.
	C		A		No.
	A		C		Yes.
	B		C		Yes.

These results did not change with various pieces of hardware plugged in,
or various patched versions of the CP/M Plus file.  Obviously the C
drive doesn't exist under unpatched versions, so that couldn't be
tested.

However, this does rule out one possibility, of the patched mentioned in
the Serial Interface "Book of Spells" (for the uninitiated, this book
has a picture of a wizard on every page... talk about annoying!).  I
have tried this patch, and it didn't help. I have also tried the patch
for double sided drives (I have one), and it didn't help either.

Because of the way that unzip works (decompresses to default drive),
decompressing to C drive required a command sequence like:

 A>c:
 C>a:unzip a:zipfile.zip e

This means that C drive is the current drive. This seemed to be the only
time when the bug showed up.  I am not sure whether this bug applies to
writing, or not, I suspect that it doesn't. [Other evidence supports
this, see below]

This leads me to the following conclusion:  There is a bug in the patch
for the silicon disk which causes problems when the silicion disk is the
current one, and one of the other drives is read from. This bug is an
occassional one, which appears apparently at random. This suggest
something like interupts being enabled at the wrong time, or whatever.

BTW, every time I have had a failure in this manner (a "faulty" block in
a file), I have been logged into C drive (I usually do -- it is a good
temporary drive), and reading from a floppy drive (usually B).  This
tends to confirm my research of today.

I am continuing my disassembly of the PATCHER.COM program.  I have
sorted out most of the program which does the actual patching, but
sorting out the bits that are patched over is more of a problem.  I am
using DazzleStar (my first time, it looks good) to do the disassembly,
and it allows me to declare various bits as instructions, bytes, words
etc. Very powerful.  If anyone wants a copy of the DazzleStar temporary
file (which will allow you to look through PATCHER.COM too), let me
know.

I would appreciate someone else trying to duplicate my results. This may
well explain why one poster didn't have any problems, and others of us
have.  In the mean time, I would advise unzipping either from the floppy
drives to the floppy drives, or totally in the ram drive.  

For your reference, other programs which are affected by this bug: ZDE,
Nsweep (only on certain sized files), LT29, FCRLZH, NULU. There are
probably plenty more, but those are the ones that I have run across so
far.

Any suggestions accepted by Email, or to this group.

I have come up with two Quantum Q2080 8" hard drives.  Can anybody tell me
anything about them?  Are they more or less the same as the Shugart SA1004?
One thing that IS different is that there does not seem to be an AC power
connector for the drive.  There is just what looks like the standard six pin DC
power connector.

This is depressing. Although it doesn't prove anything.  However, it
does sound as though there is something special about your banked ram,
or something.  Do you unzip things off the ram drive (I would do this
anyway because it is faster -- I only discovered the problem when I had
a small ram drive (one bank, instead of the usual two))?  This has no
problems.  It is only off the floppy disks, and it needs to be a pretty
big file (in another post I mentioned it happening in 15 128-byte blocks
out of about 2000 in a file) for the "random" chance to happen.

> May I hazard a guess that you're running ZCPR or similar, or 
> something else non-standard?
I am running CP/M+, as supplied, with a serial interface (no special
patch), and a ram disk (and the patch for it).  The ram
disk consists of both banks of ram, although I have had the same problem
with just one bank plugged in. I think I may even have had problems
without any ram plugged in, but the patch installed.  The serial
interface is a possibility, I guess -- who else of those with problems
has a serial interface attached to their system?
 
This does make me think of the ram patch as being the problem, so I have
started to disassemble it again. If anyone is interested in helping
work on this, you will need a copy of PATCHER.COM (out of the ram disk
rom), and a copy of DazzleStar.  I will send a copy of the DazzleStar
temporary file, which defines the symbols, etc.

Anyway, it is amazing how many Amstrad users there are out there.  Three
of us have had problems, and one hasn't. There seems to be little
difference between the setups.  We have, however, learnt that there is
no problem with using the ram drive, but there appears to be with using
the floppy drives.  On a random basis.  Does anyone know different?

I have a few machines made by a company called OSM, located in CA.  The
machines are ZEuS 3s and a ZEuS 4, these are multi user CP/M systems.
They will support most of the MP/M calls, and will even allows background
precesses, but work using mutliple CPUs in a networked configuration.  The
master provides file system services, print spooling and a few other neat
features.
	I am very fond of these computers, but I have a few problems with
the ZEuS 3s.  The copy of the os (M.U.S.E.) I have for them only supports
306 cyl 6 head 15meg hard drives, these are impossable to find.  Further
the systems are now starting to get flaky on boot.  One will only boot if
an 8 inch floppy is attached, the other (The one I had all my imporatant
data on) refuses to boot at all now...
	If anyone out there has ever heard of these machines, PLEASE mail
me, if anyone has any information on what happened to the company, or any
people who were involved with it PLEASE mail me.  I am lloking for newer
versions of the OS (I have 4.1 for the 3s and 4.7 or 8 for the 4) or at
least versions of the sysgen that will support other hard drives.  If
anyone has schematics, or patch information for the BIOS, again I would be
most thankful...

	I am looking for anything I can find.  These are really nice
machines, I want to be able to keep using them if at all possible.  Any
help would be wonderful!  Thanks.

Sorry, no experience with Zeus MP/M type stuff.
However, on the subject of disk drives, any St-506
innerface drives I've used will cheerfully allow you to
use them at less than full capacity. So if the number of
logical heads is less than or equal to number of physical
head, and same for cylinders, almost any other
drive should replace the ones you have. For example,
Seagate ST251 's have 6 heads, and 820?? cylinders, and
are going new for about $250. Unfortunately, the cheaper
bargain drives such as ST225 only have four heads and would
not plug right in. 

If the drive controller is SCSI, then the operating system
may think it reading a certain track and sector, but actually
eventually asks for an absolute sector number, so if the
scsi controller has set the correct parameters the operating
system would not know what it has physically. 

Poke around under the hood and see what kind of hard disk
controller is there?

Message-ID: <50a3eb06.1bc5b@pisa.citi.umich.edu>

This has nothing to do with CPM, but I understand you guys are the experts
on floppy drives.  I've got a computer (Apollo dn330) that has an 8 inch
floppy drive that I want to change to a 5 inch.  The 8 inch has a capacity
of 1.2 Mb, something like a st506 interface (sa850?), and a 50 pin card-edge
connector.  I've got pinouts for the 50-pin and also for the 34-pin
connector used by the 5 inch drives.

I'm told that the rotational speed is the same, and I know the sector layout
is the same, so I'm assuming that bit rates and signal timings will just
fall out for free.

1.  Will this work?

2.  Is there any chance this will just plug-n-play, or will I have to muck
around with the device driver in the OS?

3.  What do I do with pin 2 (density) on the 34-pin?  I assume tie it high
or low -- which is it?

4.  What about pin 16, motor-on?  Should I tie this high or low, or tie it
to pin 4, head-load?

5.  What is pin 2 on the 50-pin, RWC?  What should I do with it?

6.  Any tips on shopping for a 5 inch drive?  Will any drive with the 34-pin
(sa450?) connector work, as long as it's a 1.2 Meg drive?  How much should a
floppy cost?  The local repair shop has one for US $60, is that OK?

Can anyone suggest a method or program to me by which I might optimize the
sector interleave on a hard drive on a CP/M machine?  I have recently 
installed a Seagate ST-125 (20 meg) hd in my Kaypro 10 and although the 
drive is speedy, the system seems to run quite sluggishly.  The format
program (ADVFMT.COM) allows a choice of interleaves, however I'm reluctant
to back off and reformat the drive (a job of several hours) until I know
the correct value.  
 
I would also appreciate help from anyone who can give me precice definitions 
of the terms skew and interleave.  I was under the impression that these 
terms were the same, referring to the physical spacing between succcessive 
logical sectors needed to optimize access times, however some of my recent
reading has led me to believe that these terms are not interchangable.

If I can find out something about them I would rather use them

When it boots, I get the following message on one of the ports.
If I ^C after it says running, I can do CPM type stuff, like the
dir listing following.  The floppy seems to be P:, but I can't
read the floppy I found in the machine.  I think it was origonally
used for accounting stuff.  I don't know if it was a turn-key system
or what.

It is my understanding that proper usage speaks to interleave on a disk
surface, and skew speaks to the positional relationship of corresponding
sectors on different surfaces.  That is, interleave is intended to allow for
processing time that the controller needs after reading one sector and before
reading the next.  Skew, somewhat similarly, is intended to account for the
processing time that the controller needs when switching read heads.

Hello|

   Someone is talking about a CP/M emulator on Unix system ???
So, the Unix system that i'll bought is based on a Z8000 perhaps is it
possible to make a more efficient emulation because only op_codes changes
(number not mnemonic)... The Z8000 has sixteen 16bits register and the
Z80 much less... Is someone interresting by this ? Also, i can write a
translater program which translat Z80 to Z8000 assembly language...
Like Z80/8080 to 8086 when new 16bits intel micro-processor appear in
1981,2 ? Does some have a such program (Z80 to 8086) ?

 Is there a Zilog micro-processor list ??? Can i talk about Z8000 here?
Where?

 Thanks for all...    Alexandre Montaron <MONTARON@FRP8V11.BITNET>

To Ian Justman... It's a PROTOTYPE| so you can't find it in France nor in

 so there will be a lot of bugs i'm sure (but in Z8000 there will be no

information seemed to be given.
       Also, I have a Xerox 820-II with the 8" drives and was wondering if
anyone could provide me with the following information or pointers to where
I might locate this info:

       *floppy and hard disk subsystems: what is necessary, what can I
        use?
       *tech. documentation on the hardware, ROMs and anything else
       *pointers to firms that produce or market processor upgrades
        for the 820-II, like going to a Z280
       *anyone who has info on "homebrew" type alterations to this
        machine

       Thanks for any help.

P.S. Is there a Xerox users group anywhere in the Northeast or Mid-Atlantic

You'll find all of the above rolled into one :) at Holly Park
RCP/M, 201-757-1497.  Dick Roberts, the sysop, will gladly sell
you his 8" hard drive kits, if you really want some extra heat in
your house :)  Chris McEwen also runs a BBS in the same area; I
don't recall the number, but I'm sure it's liberally plastered

I own a hardworking Altos ACS8000 MP/M (multiuser) machine, which my wife
wants me to dump because it's taking up too much (guest) room.  I want to find
a good home for it with a fellow CP/M buff -- if they'll come to Santa
Barbara, California, and haul it away.

Here are the specs:

It's an Altos ACS8000 with Zilog Z80 microprocessor running MP/M II (V2.1).
It has an ACS 8200 Circuit Board supporting up to 4 concurrent users, with
208K of random access memory: 16K system memory, and 4 banks of 48K user
memory.  It has one (1) Single/Double density 8" floppy drive and a 14"
Winchester 40MB Hard Drive.

Also part of the free package is an Altos Magnetic Tape Unit (MTU-2, CMTD-
3400S2) to backup the hard disk onto 13.4 MB, 1/4", 450-foot, 4 track, high
density magnetic tape cartridges.  The MTU records data at 6400 BPI in serial
recording, Modified Frequency Modulation format, at 192 Kbits/second.

PLUS, a Televideo 925 monitor and TONS of:  manuals, 8" floppies, tape
cartridges, software on and off the hard disk --  a text editor, spell
checker, mail merger, accounting system, ADVENTURE, etc.

All for the low, low price of $0.  Just pick it up in Santa Barbara,
California, promise to love it forever, and haul it home.     -Craig Spirka

Subject: Kermit terminal emulation for CP/M

Is there a version of Kermit or Mex for CP/M on the Apple that does not lose
characters at 1200 and 2400 baud? I have an enhanced Apple 2E that I'm
using with a Datalink 2400 baud modem to download some CP/M stuff from
an IBM mainframe at the college. The IBM does not support nulls, and requires
VT100 emulation for full-screen editing. The CPM Kermit that I have is very old
(maybe 5 years or more) and only supports VT52. It drops the first 3 or 4
characters of each line at 1200 or 2400 baud.

I have the Apple Prodos Kermit (3.86), and it works fine, but I'd prefer a
direct CP/M Kermit or Xmodem that can read binaries directly on to CP/M disks.

Also, has anyone tried the MS/DOS CP/M emulators on an Apple PC Transporter?

Subject: C compilers which can be linked with Assembler (SLR for example)
Message-ID: <11736@uhccux.uhcc.Hawaii.Edu>

Dear cp/m addicts, I am looking for a C compiler. Not just ANY OLD C compiler.
I want one which generates code which can be linked into Z80 Assembler. Here 
is the problem: The monitor part of my BIOS (the thing which sets up the 
machine before booting cp/m) is currently written in SLR assembler, as is the 
rest of the BIOS. The amazing capabilities of the SLR assembler and virtual 
linker make cross-linking between BIOS and monitor quite easy. However, the 
monitor is getting longer and longer, and soon (with all the bells and 
whistles which will be required for SCSI disks as soon as I get the low-level 
SCSI driver to work, backup to SCSI tape, managing partitions on the disk and 
storing the setup of the machine in NVRAM) it will become a burden to write 
all this in assembler.

So I am looking for a C compiler with the following capabilities:
- ROMable code (that doesn't mean anything exceeding the following 
  requirements, the code actually runs in RAM),
- Generate fairly tight code (it all goes into EPROM, and 32kB EPROM isn't
  that much if a whole C run time library wants to get into that),
- Define subroutines and data structures at arbitrary addresses (so it can call
  assembler routines and access BIOS data structures),
- Call assembler subroutines with control over nearly all registers (so it 
  can pass and receive parameters from BIOS-internal routines),
- C routines have to be callable from assembler, and there will be no MAIN 
  program,
- Code can be generated at any address, and the position of stack and heap can
  be moved,
- The IO library can be replaced or modified (source code would be best), since
  no BDOS is present when the program runs all IO has to be through BIOS
  calls or assembler routines internal to the BIOS, 
- The compiler has to generate Microsoft or SLR type .REL files, because the
  linking has to be done by the SLR linker,
- or even better, it may to generate assembler source which can be assembled
  by the SLR asssembler.

Quite certainly my otherwise very nice MIX-C compiler will not do that. I know
of a few other C compilers (there is a PD small-C compiler on SIMTEL, and one 
in VOL224 or the SIG collection), I hear that some compilers are still being 
sold (for example by Jay Sage, or Aztek-C, and MI-C is still available for 
lotsof money in Germany, not identical to the low-cost MIX-C), and others may 
be defunct (C/80 and Quick-C come to mind). Are any available (frree, new for 
sale, or "used" someone wants to unload) which can fill these requirements ?

By the way, I am in no way restricted to C. I would actually prefer other 
languages like Pascal or Modula-2, but with those fancy languages the chances 
of finding a compiler whose output can be linked into assembler are even 
slimmer than with C.

For the long-term future (as soon as I finish my dissertation I might have some
spare time), are there any compilers which generate real Z280 code ? Or, for
that matter, even assemblers (I am not counting macro libraries which define
funny opcodes for the new Z280 instructions) ? That topic pops up every so
often. I hear of a few expensive cross-developments systems, but that's no fun.

Subject: Osborne 1 diskdrives. Help needed.
Message-ID: <1991Mar2.172851.669@fy.chalmers.se>

I have an Osborne 1 with diskdrive problems.

If I format a disk with 22DISKs cfmt in an IBM PC, the B-drive on the
Osborne refuses to read it. I get "bad sector"-errors each time I try
a DIR B: or a TYPE B:TEXT.FIL (the file is written by 22DISK). If I
use COPY to copy the entire disk to another in the A-drive, it reads
up to about track 30-35 and then says "read error".

However, the Osborne does not complain whatever I do with this cfmt-
formatted disk as long as I do it in the A-drive. I can read and write
without any problems at all. The A-drive also reads and writes disks
formatted and written on in the B-drive. The B-drive sometimes, but not
always, complain about A-formatted and -written disks.

I have tested this on the Osborne at several times with new disks and
using different IBMs, always with the same disappointing result.

It's very annoying not to be able to trust the B-drive. Therefore
I would be very happy if someone could comment on the causes of this disk-
drive behavior. What can I do about it? If it is misalignment, can I align
the drives myself? If so, how? (I have access to an electronics lab with
oscilloscopes, frequency-counters etc.)

                                      Thank you!

While running ZCPR on a Rainbow is quite nice, it's probably not that good
an idea. The Rainbow is primarily a CP/M-86 machine with a Z80 sidecar; ZCPR
only knows how to run Z80 programs, so you have to be willing to limit 
yourself to those if you want to run it on your Rainbow. I gave up on that
because the I/O byte didn't seem to work correctly; I couldn't get, e.g.,
generic CP/M Kermit running on the Z80.

However, it does make a fairly nice setup; the Rainbow has a huge TPA
because the operating system runs on the 8086 and therefore doesn't show
up in the Z80's memory space.

Caveat: I was running ZCPR 1.something or other that I had severely hacked
over. I don't know about running ZCPR 3 on the Rainbow.

Message-ID: <11664@pasteur.Berkeley.EDU>

My old reliable computer needs a new home.

It is an Altos model ACS 8000-2.  This is an industrial strength (big,
sturdy, and heavy) CP/M machine with:

	- 64k memory
	- 2 Shugart 8" dual-density floppy drives
	- 2 serial ports (one connects to a terminal as console)
	- 1 parallel port (centronics printer)
	- single board (no backplane)
	- CP/M 2.2
	
Comes with original manuals, schematics, and other detailed
technical documentation, as well as original packing material.

It also comes with OPRA 7.4. This is a version of CP/M 2.2 enhanced
specifically for this machine (but compatible with all CP/M software).
Enhancements include increased disk capacity, disk i/o speed,
interrupt driven type-ahead buffer, and others.

I also have other tools and programming languages with documentation.

Make an offer, any offer, and come take it away.  Alternately, suggest
a group or organization to whom it would be more benefit than trouble,
and I will consider donating it.

Message-ID: <39790001@hpcvia.CV.HP.COM>

I a have FREE CP/M machine available.  All I ask is that the recipient pick
it up at my home in Corvallis, Oregon.  

HARDWARE:
The system has 64K of memory and a 8085/8086 dual-processor.  There are two 
8" floppy drives (1.2M) and a terminal (Televideo 925).  There are serial
ports for the terminal and a modem.  There is a parallel port that is ready
to have a centronics printer hooked up to it.  While the machine was still
in use it shared a printer with a PC clone using an A-B switch.

SOFTWARE:
I have CP/M 2.2, Wordstar, Super-Calc, Dbase 2, CBASIC, CP/M-86 and a number
of other packages for it.  I  believe that I have all of the system manuals 
and most of the software manuals.

The system works fine.  It was taken out of service because my wife could no 
longer get companies to print checks for the accounting software she was 
using.  I hate to see this perfectly good system be sent to a landfill.  I
will take requests for the next 2 weeks.  Preference will be given to charit-
able organizations.  Please respond by e-mail.

A coupla years ago, or whenever, I purchased NZCOM on Epson QX-10
format. After I copyed the disks, I put the originals away, and 
didnt use them. Now, much time has passed, and when I tried to read
them, they seemed to have gone bad. Unfortunatly, I never mail in
those registration/guarentee/warrenty cards (if there even was one).
Is there any way I can get a (free) replacement?

Also, is the license of this software only valid for one machine? I
no longer own the QX-10, now instead I own a TeleTek System Master
with 8" DSDD drives...

Thanx

Subject: PacPerson needs home...

Hall-owww...!

As  some of you may have noticed, I began sending out a copy of
PacPerson to those who requested. The mistery is over; it is just
a cheap rip-off of Pacman and Ms. Pacman, with a CP/M touch.
Keep those requests coming, and they will be right on their way.

(One problem: the uuencoded file had as destination "M:PACPER.ARK."
I suspect this would cause a problem with some versions of UUDECODE
on a system without a M: drive. I haven't tried. If it does, simply
edit the darn file and get rid of the "M:"  The file is only 33K
long so most editors can handle it. Sometimes, learning to use
ED isn't that bad a deal...)

Now the sad part. I was just told be Keith Petersen (editor of this
newsgroup) that Simtel will not be accepting any more games and
will be deleting the ones that they already have (like Tetris).
So, I need a well-accessible file-serving place where these two
(PacPerson and Tetris) can be uploaded and to which I can redirect
far-future requests for those, and to which I can send more games
as I write them...  Some of you have already placed Tetris on the
BBS's, but I would like a "home base" for these games...

Any candidates?

  Thanks in advance, and enjoy!

Sorry, but you're SOL on that one if you have a
Microsoft/Applied Engineering Z80 card or any of its compatibles.
I tried to no avail to write interrupt routines, but I STILL lost
characters.  And this is at 2400+ on an Apple II Plus with a
Videx Videoterm!  The Apple CP/M system is a great system, but
this CANNOT be helped.  Please someone proveme wrong here because
I want the same thing.

As far as the PCT is concerned, it would STILL be too slow
because the PCT uses a 10 MHz V20 which makes the Apple a turbo
XT.  You could run Z80MU, but your effective speed would be
around 500kHz to 1MHz, so you'd be better off using a 386SX.  And
anything that takes advantage of the V20's hardware emulation
will let you use 8080/8085 stuff ONLY, which I think is too
limited, and what's worse is that I've heard is that the hardware
emulation is buggy.

You may find this an incredibly foolish question, but is there a CPM
emulator I can run on my AT? The reason I ask is because of a family
expense program that we have had from when we were running a z-card in
our Apple.........many years ago. I guess I would assume that any
emulator available would be in the form of software.

Please don't make too much fun of me. I had to ask!

I have two Ithaca Intersystems DPS-1 computers for sale.  These are
high-quality S-100 CP/M systems with 20-slot motherboard, 25-amp
power supply, traditional front panel (lots of lights and switches)
and a chassis strong enough to jump up and down on.

Each one has a Z-80 CPU, 64K RAM, dual SSDD 8-inch floppies with
controllers, and all that good stuff.  There are also two serial cards,
a modem card, a 2708/2716 EPROM programmer, an S-100 extender card with 
logic probe, a sound-effects board, etc.

Software:  CP/M; Microsoft M80 Macro Assembler; WordStar; Vedit; DRI Tex
word processor; ZDM debugger; D80 disassembler; Forth; DRI PL/I; Ithaca
Pascal/Z; Microsoft Basic; lots of other stuff.

All software is licensed, original disks and manuals, etc.  All hardware 
includes schematics and manuals.  There are some books and magazines, too.

Both units were working when decommissioned.  One needs a serial card, but
the other has an extra, so it balances out.  Between the two of them, you
should have a complete computer and spare parts till doomsday.

No reasonable offer refused; you pay shipping.  Send email if interested.

I wrote a pair of drivers that allowed you to use ProDOS devices under
PCPI. One was for floppies and handled drives up to 2 MB, the other
was for hard disks and allowed up to 8 MB, but it had to be
non-removable (or you would have to make VERY sure to warm-boot
if you swapped. Bye bye data otherwise).

The trouble is that the vectors had to be sized in advance, so each
potential drive took up a k or so of your TPA.

All of the above is from memory. I could dig them up, but I'd rather
not have to. They're widespread, I would hope. :-/

They are ProDOS devices, no?

I think C86 is a commercial compiler, so you won't find a "free" version.  However
DeSmet C is now shareware or free, and it's excellent.

Since the APC runs MS-DOS 2.11, virtually ANY generic compiler will work.  I
still use the latest version of Microsoft C to generate code for the NEC APC.

  z80mu on a 20mhz 286 gives you about a 2.5 mhz z80, which is not badd
all things considered.
 
  you would be surprised at how much cp/m stuff is written for the 8080/8085
instruction set.  some z80 machines had problems with the extra z80 registers
because the bios would assume the machine was going to be used like
an 8080.
 
  running z80mu on a machine like a 386sx is rather pointless, especially
if you end up purchasing the machine solely to run cp/m stuff.  even though
i have z80mu, i rarely use it because it is not enough like a cp/m environment
just when you find that you need it to be.   not to mention i have a lot of
cp/m machine specific programs.
 
  if you want a solution to your problem, your best bet would be to spend
$50 to $100 or so and buy a used cp/m machine.  then you can get one with
a real serial port, that won't drop chars even at 9600 baud.

  'bag' solutions like a cp/m card in an apple are really not great solutions
because you are still stuck with a 'funny' disk format and strange machine
anomolies.  (like slow serial ports, wierd video mapping, etc. etc.)

Perhaps Doug Braun could elucidate on the subject because his UZI
package is written using Code Works' Q/C compiler.  Is it even
compilable under Aztec C, the Toolworks C/80 compiler, BDS-C, or
Mix C?  I would very much like to know.  Because if it's Q/C
specific and you cannot legally get the Code Works' compiler, I
will be extremely disappointed.

Yes, there are a few CP/M emulators in software.  I've used Joan Riff's
Z80MU (which emulates a Z80), and also one that came from Japan (which
emulates an 8080).  These were interesting, but not too useful to me.  The
emulator from Japan can be ordered through the C Users Journal magazine, for
$8.  It is floppy #284 -- "portable 8080 emulator" -- and it comes with C
source code.  I only got it partially working before I gave up.  Expect to
do some debugging if you get this.  Joan Riff's Z80MU works better, and is
public domain, but it is slow -- as all CP/M emulators in software will be.
Z80MU should be available in many MSDOS software collections.  (I heard that
a later version of Z80MU is being sold as a real, supported product.  If you
want the freebie, look for the "original" Z80MU.)

If you're serious about running CP/M under MSDOS, consider purchasing the
UniDOS Z80 coprocessor board.  But you may also have problems getting your PC
to read your old Apple floppies.  In the UniDOS documentation, it says:

   If your CP/M computer happens to be an Apple computer with a CP/M card,
   you should purchase MatchPoint-PC.  MatchPoint-PC will allow your PC
   compatible computer to read Apple II diskettes directly.  The standard
   disk controller in your PC is not capable of reading or writing Apple
   diskettes.

My old CP/M computer is a Kaypro, so I can't vouch for MatchPoint-PC.
I can vouch for the UniDOS Z80 coprocessor board.  I bought it for $170 in
August 1990, and it does everything I wanted it to do.  It is also quite
fast -- it runs at 8 Mhz with no wait states.

MatchPoint-PC and the UniDOS board are made by:

   Micro Solutions, Inc.
   132 West Lincoln Highway
   DeKalb, Illinois 60115
   (815) 756-3411

And I purchased UniDOS from:

An ST-506 type interface is required.

Yes, and an interface card and controller, also.  What you will need in
the hardware and software line can be obtained from:
              Emerald Microware
              P.O. Box 1726
              Beaverton OR 97075
              503/641-8088    (talk to Brian)
They sell a kit that includes the interface card, controller, and
software (you provide the drive) for $245 approximately.  The drive can
be up to 40 mb.
 
To make the drive cold bootable, you will need to purchase and install a
new ROM.  Emerald sells the KayPLUS ROM for $69.95, or you can get the
well known Advent TurboROM for about $35 from Chuck Stafford,
916/483-0312.  The ROMs offer some other advantages also.
 
You WILL want to install a fan in the box!
 
>4) Do I need special software to format it?  If yes, then where can I get the

Yes.  Obtainable from the same source that you got some of the other
things that you are going to need to buy.  See above.
 
>5) Is there a limitation to the size of the hard disk?  
 
That depends upon just how much money you want to spend.
 
>6) Can the harddisk be bootable?
 
See above.
 
>7) Will I have to give up one of the floppy drives?

Not necessarily, if you install a half high drive.  Definitely, with a
full height.

   Don't know about speeding it up: I have considered recoding the terminal
loop in assembler, but nothing definite yet. I am considering a VT-10*
emulation (and the fast loop would probably be necessary for this. Perhaps
Kermit as well, although I suspect most sites will have SZ/RZ by now.
   I'll probably get around to all this in a month or so, as soon as the
weather gets cooler (so I can get into the computer room again), and once
I fix my CP/M computer (which has a !@#$%^^&*&*&^ intermittent fault).

Subject: Wanted: Shugart SA860 drive info
Message-ID: <8713@gollum.twg.com>

I picked up a few SA860 drives as spares a while back; these are
half-height 8" drives, and as such don't have the nice hefty 110 VAC
motors found in canonical full-height drives.  Instead, these drives
look much like what PC 5.25" half-heights aspire to be when they
grow up, with a bigger version of the "flat" spindle motor and a 
quarter-turn handle to "close" the drive.

I now would like to use these to replace a pair of SA850 full-height
drives.  The problem is, these drives have a single power connector
that is different from either of the two on the 850s, and of course
I have no service or installation manual for the 860s :-(.
  
Does anyone out there have info on what the power connector expects?
Or, perhaps, pointers on where I could get the documentation for the
drives?  (Or even tales of terror about the troubles I'm asking for!)

Feel free to mail me; I'll summarize mailed responses.

Thanks in advance!

Hello all!  I have some questions about the Kaypro 4 and hard disks.

1) Is it possible to connect a hard disk to a Kaypro 4?
If yes...
2) Does it require a special type of hard disk, or will a standard IBM
drive work? 
3) Does it require a special disk controller cable?
4) Do I need special software to format it?  If yes, then where can I get the
software (I haven't looked too closely at the CPM archives on Simtel yet)?
5) Is there a limitation to the size of the hard disk?  
6) Can the harddisk be bootable?
7) Will I have to give up one of the floppy drives?

Hello CPM world.  I want some ROM chip carriers.  These gizmos (a pair of 
'em) came in the PX-* I got at an auction.  A 28-pin ROM or EPROM chip 
fits in it, and the bottoms of the pins get bent under and the chip is 
fixed.  The carrier has a kind of tiny handle on each end and what you do 
is grab it by those and put it in an extra-big socket.  The whole 
arrangement lets you change program ROM chips without fuss or static 
damage.

DOES ANYONE KNOW WHERE I CAN GET MORE CARRIERS?
 
If so thanks muchly...

I suppose I could read it off a Kaypro 5.25 using 22DISK and upload it

Hello|

   I've juste bought MEDIA-MASTER v5.01 which now include a CP/M-Z80
software emulator... for PC XT or AT...
   It emulator either Z80, 8080 (software), and for which who have a
NEC V20 instead of a intel processor: 8080 (hardware)... because this chip
has a 8080 compatibility mode. (Does someone know how to enter in this mode?)
I've not fully tested yet but it speed... For example i've done in Z80 a loop
which take exactly 10 seconds on a Z80 at 4Mhz with no INT nor NMI...
On a PC XT (8088 at 4,77Mhz) with Z80MU It was taken: 147secondes, now with
ZPEM (MM v5.01) it takes only: 58secondes (for information on a commodore 128
in CP/M mode it takes 60secondes|||) I've also done the test on a 386sx-20
with ZPEM: only 7 secondes (so it's faster than a Z80 a 4Mhz|||)
   This emulator permit to acces I/O port... To acces RS232C for example (|)
And they have add a new Bdos fonction which permit to call any PC's bios fnct
   But it simply emulator a CPM22 (or perhaps a ZCPR because of the LIST cmd?)
           But it exist... Try it |       Bye| Alex.   <MONTARON@FRP8V11>

	That's all fine but there is a catch. This system came with

	SO!

	Anyone have a 801 (SSDD 8") drive lying around? I saw many

	$5 + shipping if you have just the board (under the drive)

floppies I'd like to use them.  I don't have any uncompression or
unsqueezing utilities, and I've now got only a single 5.25" drive.  Can
anyone provide a copy of a 3.5" Applicard driver on a 5.25" floppy?

Thanks.

Subject: DTC900 hard drive controller help

Greetings!  I have a monstrous old hard disk system (8", 40mb fixed and
10mb removable) hooked to my LB+ via a DTC900 nearly-SCSI controller.
The fool thing didn't survive the last move, and now I'm trying to get
it working again.  It's a nightmare of first-generation TTL gates.

If anyone out in netland has full schematics for this monster, or better
yet, a spare that they'd be willing to part with cheap (summer tuition is
coming up :-) ), I'd love to hear from you.  DTC doesn't even want to 
admit they ever made the thing in the first place, and the documentation
I have doesn't cover circuits or operation at all.  Can someone bail me
out?

(Just between thee and me, I'd *much* rather ditch it and get a nice,
quiet 3-1/2er in the 40mb range, but the wife'd pitch a fit if I did :-) )

   I have been using the Match-Point disk controller and software from
MicroSolutions for several years, and it has worked flawlessly.  I regularly
read, write, and format Apple CP/M true soft-sector and NorthStar hard-sector
diskettes.  For some reason, this package does not support the Heath hard-
sectored format.  I don't know why.

Subject: Obvious Solution the Motor On
Message-ID: <"11-Mar-91 12:39:24 EST".*.Michael_D._Sprague.wbst311@Xerox.com>

Forget the AND gate to generate Motor On, forget connecting Motor On to Ground,
just forget all that sort of stuff.  The solution was so obvious that I am
surprised that I and others didn't think of it first.

I would have written this sooner, but due to the massive ice storm we had a
week ago, I only made it into work two days last week, and those were very busy
days.

Back Track:

This has to do with replacing 8 inch drives with 5.25 or 3.5 inch high density
drives.  The problem was that an 8" interface does not supply the Motor On
signal, and that many of the new high density drives do not provide a jumper to
tie the Drive select signal to Motor On.

I had suggested using an AND gate to provide the signal.  Zoltan Fekete had
suggested that the signal just be grounded.  Grounding the signal is not good,
since as long as a floppy has been inserted, the heads will be loaded and the
drive will spin.  As I prepared to make a new interface board (this one with
room to add an AND gate chip), I realized that even with this addition, both
drives will spin if each has a floppy, and either one is selected.

Then the solution this me.  Use an IBM type twisted cable!!!  This way, the
Drive Select signal could be tied directly to that drives Motor On, and nothing
else was needed (and you can buy them for about the same cost as it would take
to make one).  Since I had a spare twisted cable lying around, I modified my
old interface board, and it worked fine.  There is still a problem with drive
ready, but I'll get to that later.

In the IBM twisted cable, all wires go directly to the first drive connector
(drive B) and then wires 10 through 15 are twisted and installed backwards for
the second drive connector (drive A).  The ground wires all come out correct,
so this results in swapping positions for DS1/Motor ON and DS2/DS3.

On your interface board, connect the controllers Drive Select 1 signal to the
Floppy Interfaces Drive Select 1 (Motor On for Drive A) and Drive Select 3
(Drive Select 2 for Drive A).  The controllers Drive Select 2 still connects to
the floppy Interfaces Drive Select 2, and also to Motor On.

Both A and B drives should now be configured as Drive B, because of the twist.
Drive A goes on the end of the cable, after the twist.  The termination
resistor should now be in drive A, rather than Drive B, because A is at the end
of the cable.

Have an controller that supports 4 drives?  No problem.  Add a second 34 pin
header to your interface board, and connect as above, substituting the
controllers Drive Select 3 and Drive Select 4 signals for Selects 1 and 2.
Again, Drives C and D must be configured as Drive B, and a termination resistor
should be in drive C (which goes at the end of the cable).

Hmmm, for those who might have been lost by my "Interface board", you need a
way to connect the signals coming from the 8" drive controller to the 5.25 (or
3.5) inch drives.  I took the controllers signals directly using a 34 wire
ribbon cable.  That connects to a 34 pin wire wrap header on my Interface
board.  There is a second 34 pin wire wrap header on the interface board, and
that is for connecting to the floppies themselves.  Using a wire wrap tool, I
then connected all the interface signals to their proper pins on both headers.

Last, I mentioned a Drive Ready problem.  On my Chinon 1.2Mb drives, there was
a jumper to select between the Disk Change Function and Drive Ready on pin 34
of the floppy.  I set it for Drive Ready .... and it almost worked.  The signal
*IS* compatible with the 8" drive ready signal.  The problem is that my
computer times out before the drive is ready and gives me an error.  Since the
drive is still spinning (the drive spins of about 10 Seconds after it is
de-selected, in case you want to use it again), if I try the command again,
everything works fine.

Still it's a pain to boot twice, or type DIR, wait then tell it to retry.

The obvious solution would be to tie the controllers drive ready signal to
ground.  As Zoltan Fekete pointed out, this will probably work fine for reading
the drive, but could cause problems when trying to write to it.  I have had no
problems writing to the drive .... yet.  But I have not used the system enough
to know if I can get away with this or not.

The other solution of course, would be to modify the BIOS (I think) of the
computer so that it takes longer for the error time out when spinning the drive
up.  Sigh!

I assume that most of you who have done this conversion have just tied Drive
Ready to ground?  If so, how well has it worked?

Message-ID: <901@adaptive.UUCP>

Greetings CP/M'rs.  I hope this is the appropriate place to ask these questions.
It was the only CP/M newsgroup I could find. We must be a dying breed :)

I just became the proud owner of a Kaypro 10, and I'm wondering if anyone has
any ideas about methods or devices I could use to regularly backup the 10M
hard drive?  It seems prudent especially in light of the firm warnings to use
"safety" before turning off the power.  I'm sure I'll forget that more than 
once or have a power outage while running sometime and I'd like to be able
to restore things.  I hope I don't have to transfer everything through the
floppy drive.

Also, while I'm here, does anyone know of a source for a PD C compiler for this
beastie?  

Thanks,

Casey Bahr

There used to be a tom of PD stuff out there, but the sources have
pretty well dried up. I do have a copy of "Small C" for my Kaypro-10,
It's a real <PIG> though; slow, limited syntax, no include function
(recompile stdio.h every time, for instance....), and worse. I'll send
you a copy if I haven't thoroughly discouraged you yet.

   Think I wrote one in Turbo Pascal about 3 years ago, but I can't remember
the details (I'm only the one who wrote it ...). I will look.

Howdy,

I looking for a replacement power supply for an Osborne Executive.
It was made by Astec, Model #9355 65W with 5v@5a, +12v@1.5a, +12v@2.1a
and -12v@.25a.  

While a direct replacement would be nice, any comparable ps with
equal or greater ratings would do, providing it fits in the case. (The
current one measures about 8x4x2 in.)

Any pointers would be appreciated.

Thanx in advance.

I wouldn't worry too much about using 'safety' unless you are in a big hurry
to shut down.  The K10 is set up such that when the '10 meg' LED is out, the
heads have been parked.  'Safety' simply does this before the time-out.

As regards backup, the floppy is the logical answer.  Sorry!

Perhaps someone else can help you on that.

Well, I had that prob myself once.
Way back then, it was due to the packing format applied by who ever packed
the file in the first place.
	I have an Amstrad cpc6128 and found that sometimes, when you CRUNCH a
file you can UNCR it, but not UNCRLZH it. I know it sounds loony, but the
two programs are in fact different.
	Maybe you have them same prob here. I dunno.
	You might try to TYPE the file and look at the displayed content. If
you get something containing a string of text that looks like a filename within
the 100 bytes or so, it probably IS still packed - one way or the other.
	Perhaps your file is simply renamed? (probably tried that already, but
don't blame me for telling you the obvious though :-))
	Oh, another stupid thing I got worked out only last month is that
SOME people (Amsters) really use the PC's LHARC packing format to crunch the
files they want packed. I found that a small tool - LHRD - can extract files
from PC's *.LZH to CP/M standard files.
	If you still have a troublesome file then Kill The Bastard!

I have a Kaypro 10 with a TurboROM and a Seagate ST-125 21 meg 3.5 in hd.
I used the Advent ADVFMT program to set up the drive, using a skew of 1,
the same, I suppose as an interleave of 1:1.  The drive access seems slow,
compared, for instance to another K-10 I have (my BBS) with a ST-251-1 5.25
in. 40 meg hd. Are there any programs out there that anyone knows of which
will give one information on the optimum skew for a particular machine/hd
combination.  The controller is the original Western Digital WD-1002.

Subject: K10 and a BBS?
Message-ID: <104098@unix.cis.pitt.edu>

	Greetings.

	I'm sorry to say that my CP/M days are numbered - I'm finally
	getting a 486 (with a 200MB ide, SVGA, etc :-) and I have
	to make up my mind on what to do with my Kaypro 10 :-(

	I can do any of the following (or you can suggest something
	else):

	1) I am considering getting a TurboROM (I know, I know... I've
	been saying this for a while.. ;-) since I already have a 30MB
	and the standard 10MB drive (40MB total) and run a BBS. We have
	a local BBS that has some CP/M stuff - something like 600K - 
	not much, really. I plan to fill up the drives with stuff from
	simtel - I already have all of the Kaypro and ZCPR 3.3 stuff :-)
	
	I have a nice ZCPR 3.3 setup and people have told me that it
	will be much easier to run a BBS on my setup that on stock
	CP/M 2.2 (anyone comment?) I just got the hang of zex and the
	wheel "business"... Anyways, anyone can recomment a decent BBS
	package? Space is not a problem but I would like the system to
	be "nice" to both the people who are seasoned CP/M users and to
	those who just got a CP/M machine for $25 :-) Anyone?

	2) Sell my K10 as it is - I'm thinking against this since I'm
	in the local computer club and there aren't that many CP/M people
	in the club (if I withdraw, there will be 2 :-) so I might just
	keep it to keep the group "reasonably" alive...

	3) Trash the K10 motherboard and put in a passive backplane
	with a CPU (IBM-on-a-board) card and a HD and FD controller.
	That way I have a portable PC... the floppy drive is IBM
	compatible, so is the HD, and I think I can get the display to
	work with a MDA card (if not, I can always get a CRT that fits
	and DOES work with MDA). If that's the case, the MB is up for
	grabs :-)

	4) Sell my K10 on the net :-( 

	I'm really interested in #1 - make a BBS out of it. I already put
	2 more 3 1/4" fans so I don't think 24H operation will hurt it.
	All I need now is the software. I'm open to suggestion.

	Take care. Please use e-mail when replying.

	P.S. I'll take a look at the simtel BBS stuff tonight and report
	on it's performance this week.. (well, _next_ week)

I have Media Master.  It's a *great* product for copying various formats
of CPM disks to MessyDos, but it's emulation of CPM was pretty poor.  I
couldn't get Zork to give a nice looking display :-)

I found Z80MU to be a much better product for emulation.

The latest version (the commercial version) of Z80MU also supports this,
although Joan recommends against it due to some (unspecified) bugs in the
8080 emulation of the V20.

>   This emulator permit to acces I/O port... To acces RS232C for example (|)

The commercial version of Z80MU also allows access to I/O ports.

I have not gotten the auto-install version of ZCPR to work with Z80MU,
because there is no real BDOS, just a funny little 256 byte trap
area.  I suspect that Media Master would suffer from the same deficiency(?).

Regarding Z80MU:

It is an impressive product.  I tried the commercial version and did not
like it, for a very application specific reason.  I actually run Unix,
with an MSDOS emulator, running the CPM emulator.  The new commercial
version of Z80MU has gobs of screen output with formatting and cursor
addressing junk.  Probably looks great on a regular PC, but in this
particular configuration screen I/O is expensive.  My application is
a database written many years ago when I was running CPM exclusively and
is too expensive to port.  I find disk operations are considerably faster
than the old 4Mhz Z80 floppy only system.  CPU intensive stuff is
noticeably, but not objectionably, slower than the Z80.  (This is on
a 20Mhz 386, under VP/IX).  Screen I/O on the Z80MU freeware version is
slow, but not painfull.   Under the commercial version it is just
unacceptable (Note that this is probably not the case running under
standard MSDOS where direct screen I/O is really direct).

BUT:

I picked up a PC BLUE Z80 coprocessor for a good price, and when installed
in an otherwise worthless XT I found an excellent CPM machine.  Running
at a full 4Mhz, combined with the XT's fast disk I/O and 40MB of hard disk,
it makes an excellent solution.  This is not really CPM, in that you work
at the dos prompt, and all normal DOS tools are available (such as a
real 'make' which I never had under CPM, and real date stamping, etc),
while the CPM programs automatically run under the coprocessor and exit
back to dos when done.  The real disadvantage is that I have to work on the
XT machine instead of the much preferrable Unix machine.  Now if I could
just get a coprocessor that would run under Unix, I might have the 
perfect setup :-)

YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY DEAD WRONG!!!!!!

IF YOU WANT TO MAKE ME EAT MY WORDS, TRY IT!!!  I know I'm right

UCRLZH11.COM _WILL_ uncrunch ?Q?, ?Z?, and ?Y? files.  What you

Sorry about that.  I had to get you with this one with the
fullest possible permissible setting on my flamethrower without
cussing (if it WAS permitted, I would have said and/or called you

And YOU don't really know what you are talking about.  I have had the
same problems as Klaus has had -- I also own a CPC6128.  The problem he
describes is exactly true, for the CPC6128.  There is a bug (somewhere)
in the Bios. I am going to have to go reverse-engineering it (there is
no Bios source available to my knowledge).

FTR, I have successfully used UCRLZH to uncrunch files (.?Z?), so it
definately does work.  This was not off the floppy drives on the
Amstrad, however (this is where the bug is).
 
So the real answer is that you are both right....  :-)  Sortof.

If you own an Amstrad, and you haven't had any problems, I would love to
hear what you do.  Otherwise, YOU don't know exactly what you are
talking about.

May I suggest, in future, that you don't jump in with all guns blazing
(to mix metaphors), and instead find out why the person made the
statement?

Also, FTR, the reason that one program works (UNCR), and another doesn't
(UNCRLZH), seems to be connected with the amount of register
preservation they do, the amount of use they make of the extra Z80
registers, what they actually call, and a few other things.

For instance, unzip (David Goodenough) doesn't work too well on the Amstrad
drives for some reason.  It works fine off my Ram disk (the patch for
which appears to have been made (autoinstall program) at a higher level
than the bug) however. [BTW, this is nothing against David's program --
it SHOULD work perfectly on the Amstrad, and does on other systems]

Unarc (I forget who wrote it at the moment), on the other hand, works
perfectly.  I looked through the source, and saw lots of places where it
used the extra registers very carefully, and preserved them all the way
through (interupts off), etc.   The comments mentioned problems with
extra register usage on "various computers".

Further information, (for those with advice rather than flames!), it
appears that everytime this bug occurs the same piece of code/whatever
is copied into the disk-sector buffer, rather than the sector required.
Only 128 bytes long, but morethan enough to scamble anything that is
supposed to be being decompressed.  I discovered this when one of my editors
(ZDE - I don't have any source to check what it does) had the same problem.  

One more little thing to note, the problem doesn't occur all the time,
and as far as I can tell it happens at random.  This cannot be true, but
I haven't discovered what causes it yet.  One possible lead is that
sometimes a file will fail, and then if the operation is tried again
after resetting the drives, it will work.  [This is CP/M+, BTW, the
drives are supposed to auto-reset when needed]

Sorry, everyone, that this has got this long.  It was intended to rebut
the flame, but the opportunity to seek others opinion on the problem
couldn't be missed.

Any useful suggestions are welcomed, and any off-the-cuff flames will be
dealt with in a suitable manner (ie, probably ignored!).

This is CP/M, not Mess-Dos.  I've never seen ANY comms program for CP/M
bigger than about 40K or so, and that is MEX1.14, which does all sorts
of tricks.  I suspect that just about any program you pick will fit on a
64K ROM.  I'd suggest trying MDM7XX, for which the full source is (or
was, ca 1984) available on SIMTEL.  You can always cut out things you

	Just to throw my own 2d in, if you are looking for term programs
for CP/M that you can readily find source to, you might want to try Kermit.
I know the source is availabe, that is how it is distributed.
	I have the 4.0 source, and I have modified it to work with some of
my stranger machines, so it is VERY flexible that way.
	The only problem I can see, and this applies for most of the other
programs too, I think, is that most of the CP/M programs that I am familiar
with don't maintain the strict segregation of code and data space that is
essential if you are going to run the prog off of the ROM.  You may be
forced to move the entire routine to RAM as part of your startup, and then

My Dad has an Apple II (possibly II+, not IIe) with a CPM card, off which he
runs in particular Wordstar.  However, his only communications program runs
on Apple DOS, making him unable to edit email very well, or hack up
responses to news articles :-).

Could anyone offer a recommendation for a (public domain hopefully) CPM
communication program that works on an Apple?

Thanks a lot!

I have a Cromemco Z-2D computer system running 
version 2.36 of CDOS  (a CP/M derivative). What
I would like to know is, does anyone out there
have such a system and, if so, do you have a hard-
drive? I need to know what the part number is on
the controller and what kind of interface the controller
expects to the harddrive (ST-506 perhaps?) Of course,
if you want to sell your harddrive and controller,
I'm interested.

Thank you.

My deepest apologies.  I guess I assumed that all BIOSes were
pretty much well-behaved and it seems to be restricted to some
BIOSes.  Also, it probably has something to do with the fact that
those computers are running CP/M Plus, which I've heard can be
flakey at times.  That's why I stick with my CP/M 2.2 stuff
(highly uprated w/ZCPR33 and stuff like that...)

Two turn interrupts on and off, one deals with memory mapping
(the Z80 card remaps the system's memory rather radically to take
into account that Pages 0-3 are sacred to the 6502, but you can
alternatively switch that mapping off to make the Z80 see it as
the 6502 sees it; for CP/M to work properly, you MUST turn
mapping on because you don't want the 6502 and the Z80 throwing
each other curves... (grin).  Also, the point needs to be made
that the card in question, the Softcard, distributed by
Microsoft, as in the ORIGINAL Softcard, not the Softcard //e,
talks DIRECTLY to the Apple hardware just like the 6502 does.  In
fact, when the Z80 has control, it puts the 6502 to sleep (I
believe it does nothing more than execute wait states).), and the
remaining one controls how the card interfaces to the Apple DMA
daisy chain.

The switches are like this:

      sw1    sw2    sw3    sw4
     MEM MAP DMA   IRQ/INT NMI  <--- SAME ON BOTH
             DAISY  ^   ^
             CHAIN  |   |_ Z80  NAME
                    |_____ 6502 NAME

Sw1:   On:  Disables memory remapping
       Off: Enables memory remapping (Apple CP/M default)


Sw2:   On:  When DMA daisy chain input is dropped low, the Z80
            will drop what it's currently doing to let a
            high-priority device do some DMA and relinquish
            control back to the 6502
       Off: Won't stop at all no matter what priority device is
            requesting DMA

                            ___                          ___
Sw3:   On:  Hooks the Z80's NMI line up with the Apple's NMI line
            on the expansion bus so the Z80 will be interrupted
            upon receipt of a non-maskable interrupt.  The
            Softcard recommends that interrupts, maskable or not,
            should be handled by the 6502 which also sees the
            interrupt, so it can clear its interrupt status and
            return control back to the Z80.
       Off: Disconnects the line.

                            ___                          ___
Sw4:   On:  Hooks the Z80's INT line up with the Apple's IRQ line
            on the expansion bus.  Discussion is the same as
            above.
       Off: Disconnects the line.

The default settings for the switches should be all of them off
for Apple CP/M to work properly.

LUX will deal with libraries too, but they're designed for
RCP/M's.  To extract the LBR's contents (provided they're not
compressed), type "-x" and then a drive/file specification, most
often times the file specificaiton will be "*.*" to extract
everything.  If you were to type "-x b:*.*" at the NULU prompt in
an open library, that means to extract all the files to drive B:,
but it won't unsqueeze the files if they're squeezed (those
files, often times, will have a "Q" as the second letter of the
file's extension).  For those files, use "-q" instead of "-x".
To unsqueeze all files with Q as the second letter of the
file type, type "-q b:*.?Q?" which will unsqueeze (or try to) all
files with the letter "Q" as the second letter in the file type.
Most CP/M programs with multiple files are in the .LBR format,
but there are the occasional .ARK, .ARC, and .ZIP files.

As I said a couple of paragraphs ago, they were distributed by
Microsoft.

If you have used CP/M on other computers, then using CP/M program
on the Apple will be more or less the same as you have used them
on, say an Osborne, a Kaypro, an SBC, or an S-100 box.  However,
if you plan to do a lot of stuff between operating systems,
particularly in ProDOS, I very much suggest that you get a
program called "Chameleon" which runs under Apple ProDOS and will
transfer between all four major diskette formats, i.e. DOS 3.3,
ProDOS (you'll need this to run Chameleon), Pascal (it will only
support the 5 1/4" variety, I believe), and CP/M.

Have fun!

 NULU will also allow you to extract the member files. Use the -H 
command to see a listing of the various options available in NULU.

 A library file is simply a method of grouping certain files together 
into one file for transfer or storage. Often the files are also 
compressed in some way as well (squeezed, crunched etc...)

 First thing... about ZP/EM (Media Master)... i haven't test it at all,
but it emulat really faster than Z80MU... In Z80MU each BIOS function and
BDOS entry point are replaced by the HALT instruction (which is trap)
i think it's also true for ZP/EM but i've not look at |
 What's the price of Z80MU commercial release?

To the person who have a Amstrad CPC 6128 (like me) where are you?
 In europe i suppose... In U.K. ? In Frence (like me...) ?
Does a HARD DISK exist for the Amstrad ???

Other thing... I perhaps will bought a prototype Unix machine made by
 COMMODORE... His name is C900, it works with a Z8001 (i suppose you know
 it?), it has a HD 20Mo, one floppy 5"1/4, 512Ko de RAM... OS: Unix Beta0.9
 this is also four RS232C, a monochrome terminal...
The price is 3000Fr so about $600 ...
 Doesany one ever heard of this machine... i'll ask in the COMMODORE group |

Hello|  I'm happy (in fact no) that someone else has found the bug...
 which replace a good sector (a CPM's block of 128 bytes) by anything else...
But if you typed ^C (equal to Bdos fnct number 13) it will work perfectly|

I thought it is  because of my ram-disk (DK'tronics 256Ko)... because one of
 my friend has a CPC w/o ram-disk and all work well| I've a clue about the bug
 All read & write disk access pass throught buffer (see BCB=Buffer Control Blk)
 There's at all 32Ko of buffer (as tou can call cache disk|) located on bank
 number 2 if i remember well. If the patch of the ram-disk alter this area it
 will bug when CPM attempt to save this block (perhaps it's the patch itself|)
 Because ^C flush (but not save) all buffer to disk...
 I think the answer is near | Make a list of BCB, search buffer & verify
 content of all buffer... to solve the bug you have to minimize buffers...
 It's my opinion... What do YOU thing of this ?

I've the OPERATOR's AND PROGRAMMER's GUIDE for the AMSTRAD CPC6128 & PCW8256
by Digital Research Inc. & Amstrad Consumer Electronics plc... it's a very
good book but it doesn't talk about the BIOS... and BCB (buffers) are manage
by the BIOS (see also DPH=Disk Parameter Header... which contain a pointer to

Subject: Help with Kaypro terminal emulation
Message-ID: <905@adaptive.UUCP>

Sorry if this belongs in the FAQ file.

I'm trying to use a modem communications program on my Kaypro 10.
It appears to be a derivative of MDM730 (sic?).  The on-line
documentation, however, doesn't give me a clue as to what type of
terminal it's emulating, which is where I'm having trouble.  Somewhere
else in other documentation I remember seeing that the Kaypro emulates
a Lear-Siegler adm3a, so that's how I've tried setting the termcap
on the Unix (Sun) machine I'm trying to connect to.  Everything
except vi seems to be working ok (TERM and TERMCAP in my environment 
look right for an adm3a).  In vi I get a garbled screen that
makes editing pretty difficult.  I remember long ago using a Kaypro II
and I think the same comm. pgm., but I don't remember how I got around
this problem.

I'm pretty illiterate in this area, so I'm hoping someone in this
group can enlighten me or provide some heuristics to getting the
termcap set properly.  Or maybe direct me to a different comm. package.
I do have a printed document for SUPRTERM, which says it emulates an
adm3a, but I can't find that software on any of my disks.

Thanks in advance,

Your apology is accecpted.  I have heard a fairly large number of BIOSes
which have problems with various things - most written for Z80 machines
in the days when 8080 code was the most common, so they assumed that
they had the extra registers to themselves.  This is no longer true.
 
I doubt that the fact they are running CP/M+ has anything to do with it.
CP/M+ seems okay to me, most of the time. Occassionaly it fails to relog
in a disk, but that is only because of the way it detects a new disk
(directory checksumming).  No where near as much hassle as logging in
disks under 2.2!
 
The trouble with the Amstrad implementation of CP/M 2.2 is that they
used a graphics screen (all the machine has - bit map 16K), which steals
most of the useful memory.  There is only about 42K TPA - hardly enough
to do anything.

I've never heard of that one.  Who puts that one out?  I would
like to kick the tires on that one.  As for the "HALT"
instruction, it does seem a logical way to write a software
emulation of the BIOS.  As for how MS-DOS picks it up, curious
how that would work.  Nick Sayer wrote someting similar, but this
is under UNIX.

You might want to try either Emerald MicroWare (whose address I
could go and snag) if anyone wants it) or any type of controller
that plugs into the Z80 slot.  Most of these controllers come
with software that will talk to the hard disk no matter what kind
of machine it's running on.  I've seen such a setup which even
comes with source code for its BIOS so it's possible for me to
get a system like this for my Ampro (for which I have source for
its BIOS _AND_ main ROM) such that the entire BIOS which will
talk to both hard and floppy disks is entirely self-contained,
and can even boot from the hard disk and not have to boot only
from the floppy and manually (or semiautomatically) run a hard
drive initialization program (not format, but put routines up so
the system can talk to the hard drive).

Gads, you have me salivating!!!!!  I know this part of the

be available in the US?  If so, that could finally put purely
UNIX machines in the hands of commoners.  Then I could gloat as

Message-ID: <NN86302.91Mar22191447@kaarne.cs.tut.fi>

I'm looking for a  8080 macro cross-assembler to run under unix.
Our site had a program called zmac, which is fo Z80 and the manual
page says:

     The Zmac assembler is modeled after  the  Intel  8080  macro
     cross-assembler  for  the Intel 8080 by Ken Borgendale.

So does anyone know the name of this program, where to get it from 
or how to contact Ken Borgendale. The only thing left of zmac here
is the manual page, so I can`t check the sources either. So finding
a ftp site that has zmac would propbaly help me a lot.

Please respond by mail. And please note that this article is a crossposting.

Subject: 9600 Baud Kermit for the 128
Message-ID: <1991Mar23.023510.3540@gn.ecn.purdue.edu>

Is there a version of Kermit for the Commodore 128 that will support 9600
baud?  The c128 can support 9600, but the version of Kermit that I have 
runs in the 64 mode, and only goes up to 2400 baud.  Kermit is the only 
file transfer program that works with my UNIX account.

By the way, I have never really used the cp/m mode of my 128, so I would
need some way of running cp/m Kermit off of Commodore formated disks. I
have no problem downloading binaries in 64 mode, except that it is very
slow.  My system includes a c128, 1571 drive, and an 80 column monitor.
Thanks in advance,

I have previously posted to this newsgroup the information that the TurboROM 
for the Kaypro CP/M computers is available from Jay Sage (Sage Microsystems

Advent TurboROM for the Kaypros is available from Charles B. Stafford, 4000 
Norris Ave., Sacramento, CA  95812, phone 916-483-0312.  He has bought out 
the stock from the now defunct Advent Corp. and is marketing it from his

To my knowledge, all of the public domain communication packages use overlays
to tailor them to a particular computer.  Therefore, if your MDM730, or
whatever, runs on your KP-10 there is a very high probability that it has the
Kaypro's ADM-3 emulation built in.  

If it would be useful to you, I could uue Superterm and send it off to you. 
However, in my opinion it is a less desirable program.  Of the old standbys,
my personal preference would be for MEX114.

The Kaypro uses a superset of the adm3a terminal commands.  The kp
enhancements make it much easier to live with, as the adm3a is
rather simple minded.  To help a little, here's the kaypro termcap
file that I've been using for several years.  Converting it to
terminfo is easy enough with captoinfo.

Subject: Osborne Executive printing problems
Message-ID: <16243@reed.UUCP>

I've been having a major problem with my Osborne Executive since I acquired
it about three years ago.  I had been able to work around it for awhile,
but about two weeks ago said problem became very pesky, and the other
people using the machine haven't been able to work around it since then.
(I've been separated from the machine by an ocean and one and a half
continents for about two months.)

The problem is this: printing.  The Executive (ROM 1.21, BIOS 1.2 Enhanced)
had never properly loaded the printer information on boot-up from SETUP.COM.

Specifically, what was connected to the CENTRONICS port: no matter how it
was permanently saved, it would respond NONE when I asked to see what the
settings were in memory.  (When I asked it to show the settings from drive
A, it would invariably inform me that the printer was connected and was
presumably ready.)

As a result, whenever I wanted to print, I would have to exit the program
(usually WS), load SETUP, load the information from the drive into memory,
exit SETUP, reload the other program, and print.  This would work for as
long as I did not reset or shut down the computer.  This worked for quite
a while, and wouldn't waste much time.

However, this doesn't work anymore.  Now, after twiddling with SETUP so that
it recognizes the printer, the Executive will refuse to load any other
program, and will crash violently.  (This problem began with PrintMaster
(which could be worked around) but spread to WordStar (fatal).)

I've tried to fix the original problem many times, playing with SETUP, alt-
ernating BIOS versions (despite the other printing problems, such as
the notorious "Unassign this device?"), and am now at wit's end.

Any suggestions?

  I think you can get zmac on simtel20 under unix-c. It's not same syntax as
Microsoft M80, or DRI MAC. 
  There was an 8080 macro assembler written in small-c by Hendriks ????
called  SMAC or some such, that was m80 compatible and produced relocatable
code. As far as I know, zmac only produced hex and binary.
  If you're not committed to emulating some particular cp/m assembler,
the macros can be done under unix with cpp or m4, so the essential piece is
the assembler itself.
  Yet another suggestion is to run a CP/M emulation under unix. You lose a lot
of CPU speed, but for assemblies the diskio may dominate anyway.
  To see how this works, rlogin in as "cpm" at hopf.purdue.edu.
This kicks you into a cp/m 2.2 emulation program. Change to drive B: and run
"mac bios "  to get an idea of how fast the emulation is for your purpose.

Oh, no, it is not just anything else.  It is always the same.  I had a
360K file which I was reading through after putting it through a naughty
program (text file, BTW).  There were 15 problems in it (15/2000 or so
is not too bad, but not too good).  Everytime there was the same string.
Always.  This has happened in the past.  The string includes some NULLs
(0), as well, but basically starts like this
"s^L^s|FF|FFx@ff<fff<<`<....".   Everytime.  Most annoying.  It also
makes me think that it is actually program which is being put in,
probably because someone failed to save a register, or something.

This is interesting. I haven't been able to test it without the ram
disk, because I have had the software installed for ages (and it is hard
to test for something which is intermittent).  At one stage I did think
that it was something to do with the patch put on for the ram disk, and
I started disassembling that.  I ran out of time (near end of year, and I
am a student....:-(  It looks as though I should go back to this.
Thought -- how old is your CPC?  Mine is a model A.  I wonder if this
has anything to do with the problem (ie, a bug fix in later versions?).

This sounds like what I was thiking of, although I hadn't got as far as
exploring the buffering.  If you are able to do what you are suggest
please do so.  For my part, I will continue my disassembly of the patch.
dk'tronics are too far gone to be able to fight about the reverse
engineering, or help with a bug fix.

Indeed it is sad. What do you have which talks about the BIOS?  We
really need something which talks about the Amstrad BIOS, or better
still a disassembly.  I will ask someone who does a lot of CP/M
programming here if they have any good books.

Anyway, I am pleased to see that I am not alone.  This also tends to
suggest to me that I was on the right track disassembling the patch for
the silicon disk.  If I can only find the disk it was on (1 of about
200....) I will go back to it. 

BTW, are there any other Amstrad CPC owners out there with this
problem?

Voila! Non-standard system. I have an Amstrad CPC 464 with 512K 
banked RAM, and the 6128 ROM. I have used David Goodenough's 
UNZIP program every day for the last 9 months without a single 
problem, even with 200K ZIP files.

I have just tried UCRLZH11 on a ?Q?, a ?Z? and a ?Y? file with no 
problems.

May I hazard a guess that you're running ZCPR or similar, or 
something else non-standard?

not on the net), send it to me and I will see to it that he gets
it.  He and I are members of the local Kaypro group.

BTW, just wondering, Lindsay, do you have NovaDOS Release J ready
yet?

Yes this is wrong place, but the thread has already started.  The C900
seems to be one of many Commodore European orphan machines, if you are
interested in UNIX then look to the Amiga 3000 UX, this machine is based
off of the Amiga 3000 68030 platform, is already in final beta stages, and
is the first machine out there to run UNIX SV r4.  Drool drool drool!!!
	I have talked with a Commodore rep and supposedly it will sell with
the entire UNIX package, X.11 and I think it was open look, NFS(TCP/IP), an
ethernet board, a 200 meg hard drive and either 6 or 8 megs of ram for well
under 10,000.  The system also will support the 24bit color card that is
coming out soon...

By the way, it will also turn into an Amiga 3000 with just a slightly
different boot up procedure (you use the mouse to pull up a boot menu and
click on Amiga or UNIX for what you want).

This isn't a chep machine, but it is a nice looking low end workstation,
and it blows away anything I have seen in the Mac arena...

Subject: Amstrad BIOS problems -- Moderately Long
Message-ID: <1991Mar27.094731.17147@actrix.gen.nz>

[To those who are not interested in the nitty gritty of a fairly
annoying bug in a patch to the Amstrad Bios, please skip this message
now.  Anyone else, feedback is very welcome to ewen@actrix.gen.nz, or to
this group]

After seeing various peoples thoughts about what the problem with the
Amstrad BIOS which causes certain programs not to work properly, I did
some experimenting with my Amstrad.

The hardware concerned was an Amstrad CPC6128, with serial interface,
512K of extra ram. For the entire of the test, I used David Goodenough's
unzip program (wonderful program, despite the problems that Amstrad
has), and a 20K Zip file which I picked up somewhere.  

The first thing I tried was removing all my extra hardware, and using
the original boot disk.  Unzip from A to B drive, worked fine.  The next
thing was to reintroduce the hardware.  The Unzip still worked fine.  I
then went back to my normal boot disk (with silicon disk patch), and
tried the same thing.  It worked fine.

Then I started experimenting with variouus combinations of drives, and
came up with the following results:

	ZIP file	Output file	Error?
	A		A		No.
	A		B		No.
	B		B		No.
	B		A		No.
	C		C		No.
	C		B		No.
	C		A		No.
	A		C		Yes.
	B		C		Yes.

These results did not change with various pieces of hardware plugged in,
or various patched versions of the CP/M Plus file.  Obviously the C
drive doesn't exist under unpatched versions, so that couldn't be
tested.

However, this does rule out one possibility, of the patched mentioned in
the Serial Interface "Book of Spells" (for the uninitiated, this book
has a picture of a wizard on every page... talk about annoying!).  I
have tried this patch, and it didn't help. I have also tried the patch
for double sided drives (I have one), and it didn't help either.

Because of the way that unzip works (decompresses to default drive),
decompressing to C drive required a command sequence like:

 A>c:
 C>a:unzip a:zipfile.zip e

This means that C drive is the current drive. This seemed to be the only
time when the bug showed up.  I am not sure whether this bug applies to
writing, or not, I suspect that it doesn't. [Other evidence supports
this, see below]

This leads me to the following conclusion:  There is a bug in the patch
for the silicon disk which causes problems when the silicion disk is the
current one, and one of the other drives is read from. This bug is an
occassional one, which appears apparently at random. This suggest
something like interupts being enabled at the wrong time, or whatever.

BTW, every time I have had a failure in this manner (a "faulty" block in
a file), I have been logged into C drive (I usually do -- it is a good
temporary drive), and reading from a floppy drive (usually B).  This
tends to confirm my research of today.

I am continuing my disassembly of the PATCHER.COM program.  I have
sorted out most of the program which does the actual patching, but
sorting out the bits that are patched over is more of a problem.  I am
using DazzleStar (my first time, it looks good) to do the disassembly,
and it allows me to declare various bits as instructions, bytes, words
etc. Very powerful.  If anyone wants a copy of the DazzleStar temporary
file (which will allow you to look through PATCHER.COM too), let me
know.

I would appreciate someone else trying to duplicate my results. This may
well explain why one poster didn't have any problems, and others of us
have.  In the mean time, I would advise unzipping either from the floppy
drives to the floppy drives, or totally in the ram drive.  

For your reference, other programs which are affected by this bug: ZDE,
Nsweep (only on certain sized files), LT29, FCRLZH, NULU. There are
probably plenty more, but those are the ones that I have run across so
far.

Any suggestions accepted by Email, or to this group.

One thing that IS different is that there does not seem to be an AC power

This is depressing. Although it doesn't prove anything.  However, it
does sound as though there is something special about your banked ram,
or something.  Do you unzip things off the ram drive (I would do this
anyway because it is faster -- I only discovered the problem when I had
a small ram drive (one bank, instead of the usual two))?  This has no
problems.  It is only off the floppy disks, and it needs to be a pretty
big file (in another post I mentioned it happening in 15 128-byte blocks
out of about 2000 in a file) for the "random" chance to happen.

> May I hazard a guess that you're running ZCPR or similar, or 
> something else non-standard?
I am running CP/M+, as supplied, with a serial interface (no special
patch), and a ram disk (and the patch for it).  The ram
disk consists of both banks of ram, although I have had the same problem
with just one bank plugged in. I think I may even have had problems
without any ram plugged in, but the patch installed.  The serial
interface is a possibility, I guess -- who else of those with problems
has a serial interface attached to their system?
 
This does make me think of the ram patch as being the problem, so I have
started to disassemble it again. If anyone is interested in helping
work on this, you will need a copy of PATCHER.COM (out of the ram disk
rom), and a copy of DazzleStar.  I will send a copy of the DazzleStar
temporary file, which defines the symbols, etc.

Anyway, it is amazing how many Amstrad users there are out there.  Three
of us have had problems, and one hasn't. There seems to be little
difference between the setups.  We have, however, learnt that there is
no problem with using the ram drive, but there appears to be with using
the floppy drives.  On a random basis.  Does anyone know different?

I have a few machines made by a company called OSM, located in CA.  The
machines are ZEuS 3s and a ZEuS 4, these are multi user CP/M systems.
They will support most of the MP/M calls, and will even allows background
precesses, but work using mutliple CPUs in a networked configuration.  The
master provides file system services, print spooling and a few other neat
features.
	I am very fond of these computers, but I have a few problems with
the ZEuS 3s.  The copy of the os (M.U.S.E.) I have for them only supports
306 cyl 6 head 15meg hard drives, these are impossable to find.  Further
the systems are now starting to get flaky on boot.  One will only boot if
an 8 inch floppy is attached, the other (The one I had all my imporatant
data on) refuses to boot at all now...
	If anyone out there has ever heard of these machines, PLEASE mail
me, if anyone has any information on what happened to the company, or any
people who were involved with it PLEASE mail me.  I am lloking for newer
versions of the OS (I have 4.1 for the 3s and 4.7 or 8 for the 4) or at
least versions of the sysgen that will support other hard drives.  If
anyone has schematics, or patch information for the BIOS, again I would be
most thankful...

	I am looking for anything I can find.  These are really nice
machines, I want to be able to keep using them if at all possible.  Any
help would be wonderful!  Thanks.

Sorry, no experience with Zeus MP/M type stuff.
However, on the subject of disk drives, any St-506
innerface drives I've used will cheerfully allow you to
use them at less than full capacity. So if the number of
logical heads is less than or equal to number of physical
head, and same for cylinders, almost any other
drive should replace the ones you have. For example,
Seagate ST251 's have 6 heads, and 820?? cylinders, and
are going new for about $250. Unfortunately, the cheaper
bargain drives such as ST225 only have four heads and would
not plug right in. 

If the drive controller is SCSI, then the operating system
may think it reading a certain track and sector, but actually
eventually asks for an absolute sector number, so if the
scsi controller has set the correct parameters the operating
system would not know what it has physically. 

Poke around under the hood and see what kind of hard disk
controller is there?

Message-ID: <50a3eb06.1bc5b@pisa.citi.umich.edu>

This has nothing to do with CPM, but I understand you guys are the experts
on floppy drives.  I've got a computer (Apollo dn330) that has an 8 inch
floppy drive that I want to change to a 5 inch.  The 8 inch has a capacity
of 1.2 Mb, something like a st506 interface (sa850?), and a 50 pin card-edge
connector.  I've got pinouts for the 50-pin and also for the 34-pin
connector used by the 5 inch drives.

I'm told that the rotational speed is the same, and I know the sector layout
is the same, so I'm assuming that bit rates and signal timings will just
fall out for free.

1.  Will this work?

2.  Is there any chance this will just plug-n-play, or will I have to muck
around with the device driver in the OS?

3.  What do I do with pin 2 (density) on the 34-pin?  I assume tie it high
or low -- which is it?

4.  What about pin 16, motor-on?  Should I tie this high or low, or tie it
to pin 4, head-load?

5.  What is pin 2 on the 50-pin, RWC?  What should I do with it?

6.  Any tips on shopping for a 5 inch drive?  Will any drive with the 34-pin
(sa450?) connector work, as long as it's a 1.2 Meg drive?  How much should a
floppy cost?  The local repair shop has one for US $60, is that OK?

terms were the same, referring to the physical spacing between succcessive 
logical sectors needed to optimize access times, however some of my recent
reading has led me to believe that these terms are not interchangable.

     Hello!

          I have come across a "ZORBA" portable computer, that is in good
     working order but there is no systems disk to go with the unit.  I
     know the following things about this unit:
     
          -  It was manufactured by:   GEMINI ELECTRONICS
                                       130 Baywood Ave.
                                       Longwood, FL  32750
                                       
          -  It is a Z80 based machine.
          
          -  It has two 784K TELCOM 5.24" disk drives.
          
          -  It uses a CPM operating system.
          
          If anyone out there knows where I can aquire a systems disk ( I am
      willing to pay for it ) or knows how I could reconstruct a systems disk
      I would like to here from you.

          P.S.
          
                    I have already call the manufacturer and they were no 
                help at all.

I have an OLD NEC APC(the original APC), on eof the dual MS-DOS / CPM
machines and am looking for some software for it. My manuals include a 
manual for the extended graphics libraries under MS-DOS but I dont have 
these libraries and NEC Australia have been less than helpful.

	I am interested in any other software for this beast and have
some user group software and a small C compiler under CPM and a full set
of manuals (including hardware!) if any one is interested.

Subject: need info on OSM Computer Corp. machine
Message-ID: <25251@hydra.gatech.EDU>

Someone gave me a couple of OSM machines with no documentation.
If I can find out something about them I would rather use them
than break them up for parts.  I have a Kaypro 10 so I'm not
a novice at CPM, but I'm not up to re-writing a BIOS either.

When it boots, I get the following message on one of the ports.
If I ^C after it says running, I can do CPM type stuff, like the
dir listing following.  The floppy seems to be P:, but I can't
read the floppy I found in the machine.  I think it was origonally
used for accounting stuff.  I don't know if it was a turn-key system
or what.

Thanks for any info.

It is my understanding that proper usage speaks to interleave on a disk
surface, and skew speaks to the positional relationship of corresponding
sectors on different surfaces.  That is, interleave is intended to allow for
processing time that the controller needs after reading one sector and before
reading the next.  Skew, somewhat similarly, is intended to account for the
processing time that the controller needs when switching read heads.

Hello|

   Someone is talking about a CP/M emulator on Unix system ???
So, the Unix system that i'll bought is based on a Z8000 perhaps is it
possible to make a more efficient emulation because only op_codes changes
(number not mnemonic)... The Z8000 has sixteen 16bits register and the
Z80 much less... Is someone interresting by this ? Also, i can write a
translater program which translat Z80 to Z8000 assembly language...
Like Z80/8080 to 8086 when new 16bits intel micro-processor appear in
1981,2 ? Does some have a such program (Z80 to 8086) ?

 Is there a Zilog micro-processor list ??? Can i talk about Z8000 here?
Where?

 Thanks for all...    Alexandre Montaron <MONTARON@FRP8V11.BITNET>

i've forget about the C900/Z8000/Unix machine...

To Ian Justman... It's a PROTOTYPE| so you can't find it in France nor in
 US nor anywhere... Sorry... But the Unix release is a beta release 0.9
 so there will be a lot of bugs i'm sure (but in Z8000 there will be no
 probleme...) Do you want to came in France to see it :-)
