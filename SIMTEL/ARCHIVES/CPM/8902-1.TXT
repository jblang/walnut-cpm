Subject: Adding a hard disk to your system

If anyone is contemplating adding an inexpensive hard disk to a floppy
only CP/M system, they might want to consider the following. A company
by the name of Advanced Concepts in Boca Raton, FL, provides a very
good solution. All you have to do with one of their systems, is pull
the Z80 out of your system, insert their daughterboard into the socket
where it came from, and put the Z80 back in a socket on the daughter
board. Then an installation program is provided that places a boot
image on the hard disk, and you are all set. Your system boots
initially from floppy, then by running the hard disk install program,
the hard disk is brought on line. I have recently installed their
system into my Televideo 803, and I can say the hardest part was
opening the system to pull out the Z80. It is worth noting that if
there is not enough space to take the daughter board inside, extension
cables are available, so that the board can be placed outside your
system enclosure.

Their address is:

Advanced Concepts
8926 South West 17th St.
Boca Raton, FL
33433

Subject: db II books wanted

Since all of you have upgraded to dBase III, or dBase III+, or dBase IV, 
while I have not, yet, I am trying to locate some out of print (?) dBase II
books.

Specifically;
	dBase II User's Guide, by Adam B. Green,
	Advanced dBase II User's Guide, by Adam B. Green,
and	dBase II for Every Business, by Robert Byers.

All were published by Ashton-Tate, way back when, in paper back.
I have tried local sources, Dalton's and Waldenbooks, Books in Print, and
Ashton-Tate.  No luck.. Soooooo. If any one has one or more, AND is willing
to part with one or more, please contact me ..

Subject: S-100 Memory card assistance

	I'd like some technical assistance with a memory card 
I've acquired recently.  It's an S-100 64K dynamic RAM board.
According to the legend on the PC board, it was made by
Measurement Systems and Controls, Inc.  The model number is DMB
6400.  The board has a copyright 1979.  It has five different
sets of DIP switches, lots of 4116 DRAMs, lots of TTL "glue", and
three delay line looking thingies.
	I believe that this board was originally OEM marketed
by Sigma Designs & installed in North Star Horizons, which
is the installation I intend for the card.  If this sounds
familiar, then maybe you can help me.  I would like to find
somewhere technical documentation to enable me to set up and
install the card in my N*.  Setup instructions and schematics
would be very nice.  I'll gladly pay for duplication and postage.
Failing that, instructions over the net would be just fine too.
And, if that doesn't work out, an address or phone number to the
manufacturer or Sigma Designs would suffice.  Please....I'm
beggin' ya...		 #8^)

To Rhonda,
  What you are looking for in terms of mex binary file transfers:  after
asking the bbs to send you the file, exit back to the command line
(usually done with a <ctrl>j e) and then type r filename.typ.  YOur
computer will then start saying it is receiving a file like kermit does.
when it is done, then type t and you will be talking with the bbs again.
  The help files you are looking for are on simtel20 and they are
PD2:<CPM.MEX> MEX-EASY.DZC AND MEXSTEPS.TQT.  And don't feel bad.  I cut
my teeth on computer comm with bbs systems, but I was totally lost when
I started on ftp and kermit about 5 months ago.

Subject: SUPERMICRO magazine

I have just finished shuffling through the latest stack of "bingo cards", 
as we call those packets of business reply cards that magazines mail to
their subscribers.  One card that got my attention offers a free trial 
issue of a magazine called SUPERMICRO.  It is described as a magazine 
devoted to VMEbus, Multibus I/II, STD bus and S-100 bus.  It is coverage 
of the S-100 bus that is of interest to me.  Has anyone subscribed or,
at least, seen this magazine?  I hesitate largely because the $24 annual
rate is for four issues.  A bit expensive for a few product announcements, 
don't you think?  I would have posted this to the Zenith Z-100 group as 
well, but I haven't figured out their address (Usenet posting is a little
awkward from this host).

By the way, I have joined the Boston Computer Society, after an absence of
several years that started with the demise of the OSI Users Group.  Anyone
remember Ohio Scientific?  I still have my little C1P, which served as the
testbed for many of my first digital projects.  I digress.  Anyway, I look 
forward to my first meeting with the CP/M subgroup, and Jay Sage.  Among 
other things, I am hoping for pointers to any local surplus stores.

Subject: What format is common for 3.5 inch CP/M disks?

Hello,

Some time ago, I added a 3.5 inch drive to my home-brew CP/M system.
After some testing, it works, so it's time to add the thing in the
BIOS. 

I wonder if there is some standard for 3.5 inch (yes, I know, there
is none officially, as my system uses yet-another-format on 5.25 inch :-),
but would like to know if there is something spread like the OSBORNE-1
format, which seems to be a common standard on 5.25 inch.

So, what format is common among 3.5 inch? I would like to know about
physical sector size, sector numbers, soft/hardware skew, way of 
selecting the next track (next cylinder/other side/interleaved/...), 
DPB, and other things one needs when hacking the BIOS.

Thanks in advance for any responses.

Geert Jan

Can anyone help? I need a C Compiler to run on a (Sys V) Unix box that
generates CPM format Z80 code.

A PD offering would be really nice but a commercial alternative would
be acceptable. Can anyone suggest anything? the alternative will be to 
buy a PC :-(

Please reply by mail (to russell@kings.co.uk) as in the best traditions

Subject: Z80 Co-processors

Does anybody out there have any experience with Z-80
co-processors of the type that plug into the PC buss??
I know that there are (were?) several on the market,
and I remember seeing a review comparing some of them.
As I remember the review found quite a disparity
between them with respect to ease-of-use/quality, so
I imagine it would be a good idea to check on this.

I got a catalog in the mail last night from Central
Computer Products.  The co-processor that they carry
is "UniDOS".  It runs a Z-80 at 8 MHz.  How do these
things communicate with DOS over the buss?  What is
the software like?  How does one run CP/M on the Z80,
or is that done??  In other words, how does CP/M on
the co-processor access the PC hardware (disks)??
The UniDOS device is on a half-card, and costs $175.

Please don't suggest things like Z80MU or the V20 in
8080 emulation mode.  I like Z80MU, however it is
**VERY** slow.  I don't really like the 8080 restriction
of the V20 ... I run a **LOT** of Z80 code.

Subject: UniDos Coprocessor

The UniDos Z80 coprocessor card is made by MicroSolutions, producer of
the Uniform software product for handling foreign-format diskettes.  I
have their card and am extremely pleased with it.  It seems to run all
standard CP/M programs that I have thrown at it without problem and much
faster than on any of my real CP/M machines.  So far, however, I have
not been able to get Z-System running on it.  Even if the code would
run, of course, there would be problems because of the fundamental
differences in MS-DOS file structures (CP/M user numbers vs. DOS

On my SB180FX I use exactly the same format with 3.5 inch drives I use
with 5.25 inch drives (the native SB180FX format: 788 KBytes, 40 Sectors
per track).
I can mail You any additional information (DPBs etc.)

Another company has been selling a similar system for about 3 or 4
years now.  Emerald Microware in Oregon at (503) 641-0347.  Same deal
with a Z80 host card and connected to WD card.  Runs up to 2 64M
hard drives off a single card.  I don't remember the cost; in particular,
the hard drive card side (not host adapter) varies depending on
availability.

Expensive it is.  I have issues 2,3,4 of S-100 Journal, and issue 1 of 
Supermicro, which is what they have become.  There is apparently not enough
support for S-100 systems out there.  As S-100 Journal, they carried articles
on HOW_TO_BUILD (a) a 1-Mb Static Ram Board (with schematics), a four-port
serial I/O board, with schematics, a Clock/claendar board, with schematics.
I rather doubt that as SUPERMICRO they will have such well-done articles, 
since the real bux are in VME, but there were no articles as yet.  Yes, they
have a LARGE section on product announcements.  For software, they heavily
favor Concurrent CP/M and CRDOS (Cromemco's OS), with an occasional mention
of MS-DOS.  They don't as a rule favor MS-DOS, but do accept the necessity 
of using it on a 286/Z80 board, for instance.  There was a damning review
of a 386 S-100 board in the latest issue, concluding that it wasn't worth
the cost, unless you happen to run the two or three programs the board was
tested with and ran.  They are trying, give 'em a chance.  FAR better than
Byte has been in the last 8 years.  So far.

I bought just the controller card and cables and software for about $200
If you add a hard disk, a powersupply and enclosure, I'd guess that the
cost would rise to no more than $500, possibly less. I don't actually
know, because I wasn't interested in a PSU or a disk (I already had both).
I'd say give them a call, or write. If you DO phone, don't be put off if
it sounds like a private residence, it's a small company, and I think
they don't have a proper switchboard operator. Whoever can get it answers
the phone.

The hard disk is repaired, reformatted, files restored, and RCP/M
Royal Oak is now back on-line.

Thanks for your continued support.  Bob Clyne and I intend to add some
more nodes to the system and to install a Detroit phone number so we
can again be reached by PC Pursuit or Starlink.  We now have the
hardware to add 2 more nodes if support continues (phone lines are not
cheap).

For new Info-Cpm readers: RCP/M Royal Oak carries many of the same
CP/M files that are available from Simtel20.  The system has 64
megabytes of on-line storage, partitioned into ten logical drives.

Yes, I subscribed to it for two or three issues, about a year ago (maybe a year
and a half). They are now in some cardboard box behind my desk. The first issue
I received was still called "S100 magazine", then they renamed themselves. Even
at that time it was only 20% S100 coverage, the rest all VME, Multibus etc.
Their cp/m coverage (from any non-S10 point of view) was nearly null. I don't
think it's worth the price just for its S100 or cp/m coverage; except if you
are desperate for the last magazine which has ANY (if little) S100 coverage.

By the way ... speaking about cp/m and computer magazines: In Germany (and
probably in Austria and Switzerland, too) there is still quite a bit of cp/m
activity going on. I think there are three main reasons:
(1) A whole lot of industrial control systems, based on the ECB bus (first used
by Kontron); many boards are available (often from very small, innovative
manufacturers). Many of the industrial control system boards are pretty
expensive, but often powerfull (for example, the typical memory board is 64kB
static CMOS memory with battery backup !)
(2) Two popular German computer magazines picked up on the ECB bus, and had
several lines of boards for it. There are several very nice boards available,
and you can get empty PC boards and part kits pretty cheap. These days you have
a choice of Z80, 64180, Z280, 8088, 68008, and even 68020 and 8086 for your
processor on ECB boards, while sharing periphereals. One magazine even did an
IBM XT look-alike on ECB boards.
(3) The Amstrad cp/m machines (sold under the "Schneider" brand name) are
pretty popular in the lower end of home-computers.

Getting back to magazines, the two are
- "mc" (which these days caters mostly to the IBM, Atari and Amiga market, and
   is more oriented towards product reviews and software, similar to Byte.
   Carries a few cp/m or Z80-hardware articles A YEAR, so not worth the price,
- "c't" (yes, with an apostrophe in it), which is more hardware and project
  oriented. Typical projects these days are for example an 68020 adapter board
  for your Amiga, or a Z80 microcontroller board on 5cm x 8cm with ECB bus
  adapter (using SMD). Still has on the average a few 8-bit articles per issue.
  Very much recommended.

If you happen to speak German and are interested, send me a message, I can give
you the adresses where to subscribe (and even get back issues). If you happen
to be close by, drop by my office and look at a stack of c't's. On the other
hand, I am probably the only subscriber to this list in Hawaii who speaks
German ...

Which version of KERMIT your are using on the Kaypro should be
irrelevant.  What is relevant is that you have to tell VAX KERMIT
that the file type is binary.
The command is SET FILE TYPE BINARY
Actually I'm surprised you got the whole file, since my Vax kermit throws
up unless it sees line feeds regularly except in binary mode.

The Kaypro Kermit ought to not care about file type, but Vax kermit does.

Thanks for the information and the consolation.  I guess ftp & kermit

Uh. There are a different physical and logical formats possible.
Assuming, you know the physical format (number of tracks, sectorsize
and so on..), you still have to know, how many systemtracks are used
(up to 5 tracks starting at 0). behind them starts the directory-area
- the size of it also depends on the format which is used. each dir-
entry has a length of 32 byte:

byte 0   : user-number (owner), mostly 00 - you can ignore it
           user-number = 0xe5 => deleted file(entry)
                       = 0xff => unused direntry
byte 1-8 : filename, left-centered, filled-up with 0x20 (spaces)
byte 9-11: extension, same format as filename
           if any of these three bytes has bit 7 set, it is
           marked either for read/only or as a system-file
byte 12  : each dir-entry describes a part of the file up to
           16-kbyte. byte 12 is the "partnumber".
byte 13-14 : unused, both 0x00
byte 15    : this bytes describes, how many records belong to this
             direntry (each record is 128 byte long - this is the
             logical sectorsize of cp/m).
byte 16-31 : blocknumbers (of course the blocksize depends on the
             used format : 1, 2, 4 or 8 kByte)
byte 32    : internally used
byte 33-35 : internally used

the blocks are countet from the beginning of the directory-area. for
example the data for the "standart"-format "osborne-dd":
single-sided, double-density, 5 sectors with each 1024 byte per track,
40 tracks, 3 system-tracks, blocksize 1k, dir-size 2 blocks (2 k),
no skew. Oh, a logical skew also is possible...

if you could tell me, which format you have to read, or from which
machine the disks are, perhaps i can tell you the correct parameters.

The 3" disks are single sided/single density with 40 tracks each side
and 36 sectors/track (128 byte sector size).
So you will have 2*180 KB of data minus system tracks and dir-groups
on a disk.
I don't know (sorry) how much bytes for system are used by this CPM3
machine but the AMSTRAD 464 CPM2.2 disks have two system tracks and
two dir-groups so the disks will at least contain 169 KB on each side.

I heard of a second 3" drive distributed by AMSTRAD, that is double
sided/double density. So you'll get 720 KB (minus system ...).

have an MS/DOS header added which will find where the BB memory is and
copy the Z80 code (along with the BIOS/BDOS routines, more about them
later) up to the BB memory, and then releases the hold on the Z80
using an I/O port on the PC (also selectable, I think).  When the 
CP/M program wants to do I/O or whatever, the BIOS/BDOS emulation
routines set up info in a buffer (I think) and either set a flag
or use an I/O port to notify the PC that help is needed, at which 
point the PC does what is needed and then lets the Z80 run again.

On the Baby Blue, you prepare a CP/M program by adding the loader
to the .COM, and then you just run the program as though it were a
standard MS/DOS program.

Be sure that the UniDOS board will actually run on your PC when the
PC runs at the speed you wish it to.  My Baby Blue board is for sale
because it would not run fast enough to keep up with my AT. (8MHz BUS
Think about it... a Z80B is a 6MHz part.  Anybody with a PC or XT want
to buy a good Baby Blue board?)
	
(And I personally think $175 is too much. I only want $70 for mine!)
Hope this helped.  Anybody else have contrary info to mine?
Anybody have any idea how to get my Baby Blue board to work on my
AT?????

Subject: NorthStar support

  I need help!!! I have a lot of experimental data stored in a NorthStar 
machine. It uses 51/4" floppies and "NorthStar DOS" which I can't read 
into any other computer. I need to recover this information somehow and 
I am not enough of a hacker to write a code to do the trick. Is there any one 
out there who knows how to do this? Is there any chance that Kermit was 
ever ported to the NorthStar? Any other suggestions?

As I mentioned in a previous posting, I have the UniDos card, which I
obtained directly from MicroSolutions, the manufacturer.  It runs CP/M COM
files WITHOUT the need for any header (and it detects them automatically). 
I have no speed problem on my 16 MHz Compaq 386 machine.  It sounds as
though its technology is more advanced than that of the Blue Lightning.

 Sure do, Rusty.
 
 I happen to own one of the above mentioned boards. It's from
MicroSolutions, BTW, and "UniDOS" is the name of the software that
comes with the board. That answers one of your questions right
there: UniDOS loads as a TSR and when you type an executable name
at the prompt, it will "help" DOS by looking for a *.CPM file if
all else fails. If found, the CP/M program is loaded in the 64k
that is on-board the coprocessor card (no memory sharing with this
board), and executed with the Z80/UniDOS combo in control.
 
 I operate my machine at 8 MHz as well, and I have no problems with
this board. Note that even though it claims to do 8 MHz, it comes
out to about 5 or 6 MHz in the long run.
 
 I highly recommend it, since it comes complete with a current
legal copy of MiscroSolutions most famous product: Uniform-PC,
which allows you to read/write/initialize CP/M format disks in your
IBM drive.
 
 BTW, Rusty, leave me some E-mail, I'm having problems getting back
to you on that KQ4 problem.

Subject: CP/M beginner (a little late, maybe, but....)

      I've had a Commodore 128 for several years now and the CP/M disks that    came with it have been sitting in a disk box on a shelf in my room nearly un-
touched (except for those few times when, out of boredom, I booted them up,     played around with them for a few minutes, then reset the machine & loaded up   Bard's Tale or whatever game I was into that particular month).
      Anyway, I'd like to try to start learning a little about CP/M in between  all the other projects I constantly find myself starting out on.  Is there a    decent (inexpensive) book that's not too hard to come by that can teach me
the basics?
      What CP/M systems is c128 cp/m compatible with?  How can I download files onto a cp/m formatted disk (do I need a special term prog, or do I have to down-load them and then convert them somehow?)

      Answers and introductions will be greatly appreciated.

      Thanks, 
      Don

There is a card that you can buy from MicroSolutions (same people who make
the UniDos Z80 card that has been discussed here recently) that will allow
an XT or AT to format, read, and write NorthStar hard-sector-format CP/M
diskettes.  I assume that these are the same diskettes as those for what you
refer to as NorthStar DOS.  If you have only a small number of diskettes, I
would be willing to have you send them to me, and I would convert them to
some other standard format (such as MS-DOS 360K or 1.2M 5").  There would be
a few simple conditions, so check with me first.  If you still have the
NorthStar machine, I do have a version of MDM727 (MODEM7) for it -- that's
how I used to get files to and from that machine.

	I have had my Heath H-90 for some time now and I have recently
picked up a Dynabyte DB8/1 and DB8/4 disk drive really cheap (free).
It's a CP/M machine but isn't much good to me at the moment (limited 
software...).  The question is, what can I do with it?  (Other than
using it for a very heavy dorrstop :-)  I was thinking of linking it up
with the H-90 as a co-processor or maybe as extra disk space.  Oh, I blew
up the Hazeltine 1500 that came with it so I don't have a terminal for it
anymore either.  The DB8/4 has two 8 inch full height drives that hold
somewhere on the neighbourhood of 100K each.  The system has 2 serial and
1 parrallel port plus the drive port.  So here it is, any ideas?

Thanks in advance,

Re: urgent request from aquada@athena.mit.edu

If the info on the disk(s) is in CP/M format, there is lots of 
people on the net and elsewhere that can help you with simple 
transfers.  (For example, I have a N* and PC sitting next to each 
other and FTP between them vai a commo line and MEX quite 
frequently.)
 
If the info on the disk(s) is really in NorthStar DOS (a N* 
proprietary disk format which was overcome by CP/M, giving you 
some idea of its age) things become much tougher.  Even if the 
transfer is done, the files may be useless as most N* DOS data 
files involve N* proprietary *programs*, standard ASCII may not 
be available.
 
In the latter, Randy Fischer of Fischer Computer systems may be 
the last surviving commercial N* DOS expert.  Phone is (707)965-

customer.
 
(Anybody know if N*, the company, still exists? - I'm still 
running a Horizon, but now under multi-processor TurboDOS.  Last 
I heard they were making 'Dimensions' - a multi-user MS-DOS 
machine with some variant of TurboDOS ...)

I have an old Kaypro II with one defective disk drive and another

uses single-sided double-density drives, which are somewhat hard to
come by.  I believe that double-sided drives would work (since the
"side" pin is just empty) but full-height double-sided drives also
seem to be hard to come by.

If anyone has any information on how to go about where to find

Subject: MAC or RMAC Command Line

Hi all --

  I'd like to try to compile ZCPR 3.3, so I transferred my
copies of RMAC and MAC over from the old 8" diskettes in
preparation.  But I can't find my documentation, and I've
long since forgotten the command line syntax for these
things.  Does anyone out there remember??  Will really
*OLD* versions of MAC work on ZCPR 3.3??  Is there a
better way??

	Actually, I'd like a full listing of the BIOS and BDOS
source.  And I inherited the system with no distribution disks
and very little documentation.  Such is life; I'll make do.
	In fact, I'm a little unsure of the pedigree of my copy of
CP/M.  I understand that both N* and Lifeboat Associates offered
versions of CP/M.  Everything on the surface indicates that my
CP/M is from N*, but a great deal of the internals if it that
I've seen so far looks like the Lifeboat CP/M stuff I've seen.
For instance, the user area looks the same, except in a different
location if the SYSGEN image (Actually, the SYSGEN image resides
at a different address at SYSGEN load time, I think.)
	Ah, the mysteries of it all.
	Thanks for your help and interest!!

a file there called NSUSER5Z.AQM which, when unsqueezed,
appears to be a N* Bios USER area which supports some pretty

When I saw this message, I got all excited, because I have been having a
similar problem with an internal modem on my Kaypro 286/16 computer.  The
PCBoard BBS software refuses to run, complaining that carrier detect is
asserted.  I played with all the switches on the board and with the "&C" and
"&D" commands to the modem, all to no avail.  I thought maybe this message
would have some clues for me.  Then I got to the part:
 
>> I just purchased a new modem (Zoom Telephonics 2400 baud external)
 
Curious!  The modem that is giving me trouble just happens to be a Zoom
modem (model 2400 PC, I believe it is called -- very fancy with internal
messaging capability, real-time clock, demon dialing, etc.)!  Probably just
a coincidence, but...  This modem claims to be as Hayes compatible as a
Hayes, but no matter what, that carrier detect signal seems to be there all
the time.
 
I will have to get myself copies of the two programs mentioned, BRKBOX and
COMHELP, and see what they report about the modem interface.  I tried
writing a quick Turbo Pascal program to look at the ports, but I did not
succeed in learning anything useful.
 
Does anyone have any suggestions on this problem?  Anyone else own this
modem?

I currently have an Epson PX-8 lap top computer that I really enjoy
and find useful. I also have a PF-10 portable floppy 3-1/2" disk
drive. Both of these I bought through the mail order company, DAK,
in California for truly discount prices. I am intersted in getting
another PF10, but Dak has finally run out of their supply. Does
anyone know where I can get one, without having to pay the $600 list
price? Or does anyone know what other disk drives are compatible with
the PX-8? It is not a requirement that the drive be portable. Any
good drive that is compatible will do. Also, I would be willing to
consider buying a used drive if it were in good condition. Any ideas
would be welcome. Thanks in advance.

You are correct.  The N* bios does not support the IOBYTE.

I've tried every variation of your address I can think of in many
vain attempts to reach you, but all mail bounces.  Several other 
N* people on the net with whom I'm in contact have also been unable
to get mail to you.

Can you supply a path from some major site?  There is a lot of N*

Subject: Paperclip

I have a copy of Paperclip II and Paperclip III.  As far as I know it
is software for the Commodore 128 and Commodore 64 mode (in one pack
for the c128...however this is an actual c128 program....not a c64
emulation program) or Commodore 64 only.  

Paperclip II was very nice.  It allows for italics, underlining,
boldface, subscripts, superscripts, assorted pitchs, etc etc.
You are able to save your files as program files and sequential files.
Form letters (or any document containing variable blocks) are easy.
It is mostly driven by control codes (q.v. Ctrl-o = printer output).
You are allowed to copy it as many times as you want.  It only runs if
you plug the key (a PLA or something) into the control port however.

Paperclip III is wonderful and is one of the best c128 word processors
available.  It will accept all work done on Paperclip II.  Changes
made were to make it menu driven (via the 'F' keys) as well as control
code driven.  Overall it is more user friendly.  Multi-line headers
and footers are now allowed.  Screen color can be changed and the
video output (examining a document as it would be printed) now shows
superscripts, subscripts, underlining, italics, everything...just as
the printer does.  It further inhances those special areas in
different colored text for ease of editing.

Both Paperclips handle ranges and columns well. You can move things
around as well as copy it here and there.

The dictionary is quick (for a commodore...with a 1571) and easy to update.

All in all I think it is wonderful.  The only thing I have had
problems with is the telecommunications mode.  I cannot find a working
termcap.  It does nothing with control characters.  I termcap could
probably be made by someone with a little time to spare.


Happy to give it a good rating
-Mark R. Hansen


Correction: my previous posting listed Paperclip as being made by
            BATTERIES NOT INCLUDED...that was an oops....It is really
            BATTERIES INCLUDED

Subject: moving/adding a hard drive

I have several dual-processor Z-100's with lots of RAM, dual 5 1/4"
and dual 8" floppy drives, and an S-100 bus.  It runs MS-DOS on its
16-bit engine and CP/M (which I rarely use) on its 8-bit engine.
Please forgive me for posting to this group, but absolutely NO ONE
answered my question on the Z100 group, so I'm hoping to find more
knowledgeable readers or hackers (in the good sense) here!

A dual-processor Vector 4 computer with 128K RAM, 10 Mb hard drive,
and 596 Kb hard-sectored floppy drive, running both CP/M and CP/M-86,
recently "fell into my lap".  It has a "modified" S-100 bus (its
cards do NOT have on-board voltage regulators).  It came with gobs
of software and works fine, but I have little use for yet another
computer. :-)  BUT IF I can move its disk driver board to one of my
Z-100's, that would be a positive step!  (I suppose I could always
try to sell the Vector, but I doubt it has enough resale value to
be worth advertising.  And just trashing it seems so wasteful.)

I have plenty of hardware "smarts" to add voltage regulators, change
I/O port addresses, etc., but I don't have the slightest idea how to
go about telling an operating system that I've added more drives.
I do have several disks of what appears to be BIOS/BDOS source code
for the 16-bit engine, and I have coded in assembly language for
many years.  It's almost embarrassing, considering my affiliation
and what I do for a living, but what I do NOT know is WHAT to do!
Can anyone please either tell me what to do or what to read (and
where to find it) so that I can learn what to do?

Subject: CP/M-Plus Disk Access

A while back I posted a question on how to access a disk directly via the
CP/M-Plus BIOS on a banked system.  Several people replied, discussing the
"Direct BIOS Call" BDOS function (number 50).  Many thanks to those people.

However, I am still having problems setting up a buffer properly.  To
perform a disk access (say, a READ for this example) I make the following
calls to the BIOS via the BDOS:  SETBNK, SELDISK, SETTRACK, SETSECTOR, 
SETDMA, READ.  The result is that floppy drive turns on briefly, then turns
off, and the buffer I specified by the SETDMA call does not contain data
that I know are in the disk sector I specified.

The buffer I am trying to set up is not in the shared memory area, and I
get the feeling that the data are being copied into the wrong bank, and that
I'm very lucky not to have CP/M crash on me.

Here are my questions:  Am I really setting up this access properly?  If not,
what am I doing wrong?  Also, the reference I am using mentions the existence
of a "System Control Block" which contains a bunch of useful information,
and it also describes a BDOS function that returns the address of the block.
Does anyone know what the format of the System Control Block is, and could
they tell me what it is?

I've contacted the vendor of my CP/M implementation, and they no longer
carry DRI's Programmer's and System Guides.  DRI has passed CP/M support on
to a firm called Alexander and Lord, but they demand $350 for the manuals I
need (a price which I am not willing to spend right now).

Any help you can give me would be much appreciated.

can help you.  Which disk controller do you have?

Subject: need help with Micro Design Associates S-100 board

I hsven't seen a comp.arch.s100, so this is probably the best place to 
post this...   I was given a few S-100 boards recently: The floppy
controller is a Micro Design Associates FC-100, using a Western Digital
2793-02, with U12, probably an EPROM missing.  This board has both 8"
and 5.25" drive connectors on it.  The memory bpoard is a Macrotech 
"MAX", with what appears to be 1mb of 4164s on it.  The CPU is a 
Advanced Digital "Super Quad".  I am looking for documentation on all
three, plus a boot disk for the super quad.  No they wern't all part of the
same system.  I plan on using the Super-Quad in a home control system,
and the MAX and the floppy controller in my main system.

Subject: C128 CP/M

Since I didn't get any response from E-mailing directly, I'm
assuming the mail never got there, so I'm posting here instead.
(I don't understand E-mail...I just try to use it.)

In response to Don's (DON@VAX1.ACS.UDEL.EDU) question about
C128 CP/M:

I haven't used CP/M on my 128 much, either, but maybe I can give
you a little help.

The C128 CP/M will run most Z80 CP/M software, except for the
machine-specific programs.  The control characters that it
uses for screen formatting is the same as ADM31 terminals, which
I think is what Kaypro uses. (The C-128 Programmer's Reference
Manual has more info on that.)  Getting the programs is more
difficult.  If you wish to download via modem, you need a terminal
program that runs under CP/M, and the newer version of CP/M that
supports RS-232.  Otherwise, some sort of conversion program is needed.
Another possibility is getting disks from places such as
the Pubic Domain Users Group.  If you have the 1571 drive, you can read
other CP/M formats, which makes getting software easier.

Some suggestions that may help in directly reading a disk under
CP/M Plus:

Call SETBNK with A=1 to set the TPA bank.
Call SECTRAN.

Does the READ return with good status?  Is the data in your buffer
changed after the READ?  Remember that in CP/M Plus the bios does
*physical* sector io; you must have a full sector-sized buffer and do
the deblocking in the application.  CPM22RSX (or a similar name) is a
tool for helping with this.

The SCB (system control block) is mostly documented in the manual, but
you don't need or want it for this purpose.  It is in common memory,
and is used for BIOS and BDOS parameters (e.g. current DMA address),
configuration bytes, messages between the CCP and the BDOS, etc.
Unless you *really* know the system's innards, treat it as strictly
read-only!

I would just make two small modifications to this suggestion.  First, to
check the hypothesis, try entering the IFQ command (this may be simply
IF with no argument if you are using Joe Wright's specially modified FCP
module).  This will display the current flow state.
 
Second, XIF will not help.  It is flow controlled just like any other
commands and will only clear the flow state back to null if the current
flow state is true.  That is why I added the command ZIF (zero if state).
It clears the flow state to null no matter what the present state is.

Subject: Looking for MP/M specs/documentation

MP/M is a multi-user version of CP/M v2.2.  Each user gets their 
own 48k bank of ram, the upper 16k is the 'executive'.  The 
single processor is switched between users by bank selecting.  I 
don't know if CP/M itself must also squeeze in the 48k, giving 
each user their own copy of the os.  There is a Osborne-Hill 
guide to CP/M and MP/M with all the system calls - maybe still in 
print, it (the book, not the os!) was very popular at the time.  
MP/M gave the user too little memory, a slower than normal 
processor (due to sharing it with other users), and very 
rudimentary file control (user numbers).  Looked just like 
standard CP/M to the user, but with the user # in the prompt.
 
I'm much more familiar with NorthStar's varient of MP/M called 
TSS/C - each user got 56k of Ram to hold a copy of CP/M and their 
programs, the upper 8k did nothing but switch the z80 between 
banks and manage the disk(s) and printer(s).  There was also a 
32k bank dedicated to the system.  Worked well but slow.  (Five 
[!] users on one 4mHz Z80 - what did I expect!)
 
NorthStar (and I) replaced TSS/C with TurboDOS, a multi-
*processor* system - giving each user a dedicated (z80 or 8086) 
processor w/Ram with one 'master' processor w/Ram for shared 
resources.  Block diagram looks just like a LAN with all 
processors in one box.
 
Both systems generally ran only on S100 boxes.  Most s100 SBC's 
(Single-board computers) have TurboDOS drivers available.

Subject: HELP with index's of file{

I am looking for some help in building the file index' for the SIMTEL
collection.

If in your wanderings thru the SIMTEL collections:
	PD1:<HZ100>
	PD1:<MSDOS>
	PD1:<PCBLUE>
	PD2:<CPM>
You find a file for which the .IDX files with descriptions
are lacking, AND you have a short description along with the
Directory, sub-directory, and file name, 

Send me the information, I am building (slowly) new .IDX files with
one line discriptions for inclusion in the collections.

As NEW files are added, the .IDX files with discriptions are being added.
But, its the older files I'm having trouble getting good discriptions for.

Respond to me directly, not the BBOARDs..

Thanks for your help

Subject: One more beginner question...

All right...Thanks to some really great people, I got my last question 
answered. That, however, just led to another one. 

If I have a C/PM system disk, how can I modify it so that it would work w/
my serial card and terminal? How could I tell the system disk that my card
is addressed as port 4, and that control is at 84, and how can I tell it which
bits in the control byte stand for Receive Buffer Full, or Transmit Buffer
Full, etc...

My main concern here, is, is that even if I get the drives working, I'm 
relatively sure that I've transhed my System disk. I have another one, but I'm
not sure if it'll work. I've heard from a couple of people who have Tarbell
equiptment they would sell me, but before I buy anything, I'd like to know if
I can USE any of it w/ my present setup...

Thanks much!

No I have not received the diskette. I have officially requested a
refund of my money for it, i.e. I sent a letter with a copy of the
cancelled check to the woman I talked to originally.

As much as I would like to have it, it just isn't worth the hassle.  I
dont want to sound negative.  I like Commodore equipment, but a
company can't live on the hardware alone, they have to be able to
provide service.  I am a programmer with a 10 million dollar company
and I have seen us and others get burned because of the kind of
organizations similar Commodore.  It is for that reason that I will
not support them(CBM) by purchasing any more of their equipment.

I don't mean to get wound up, sorry.  But that kind of service is just
too much.  I am to the point that I am probably going to replace this
with something else.  I have to wait and see on that though.

Anyway thanks for the offer, but I think that it is too late for
Commodore to mend the fence with me.

Maybe we can talk again.  I can only hope that somebody at Commodore
wises up before it is too late for them.

I'd like to find a copy of Kermit for an ACI-1 computer (Alspa Computers,
a defunct company which used to be in Santa Cruz).  The ACI runs on 8"
soft-sectored single-sided floppy drive(s), using an IBM-compatible double-
density format.  It doesn't have any form of transfer protocol (besides PIP)
so transferring a file is rather difficult.

Does anyone out there in USENET-land know where I can score a copy of Kermit
for this machine?  I have Kermit on my Commodore 128, but it's a specialized
version to handle the bizarre RS232 implementation in the 128 and probably
only works with CP/M Plus anyway.  Please send mail to hermit@ssyx.ucsc.edu
if you have any info.  Thanks in advance.

While doing some cleaning, I found several S-100 (and other) boards
and other stuff I've accumulated over many years.  Is there ANY market
for such things now, or should I just trash them?  I have:
*  3 Solid State Music S-100 music-maker boards (NOT RAM!),
*  1 Computalker S-100 board,
*  1 Cromemco S-100 DAZZLER board,
*  1 MPA S-100 board (adapts a 6502 chip to run on an S-100 bus),
*  1 whole VECTOR 4 computer with a 10 MByte hard disk, a 600Kbyte
     hard-sectored floppy drive, 128Kbyte RAM, a "modified" (i.e., no
     on-card voltage regulators) S-100 bus, and over 100 diskettes of
     stuff including dBase II, BCSD (?) C, assembler, a spreadsheet, a
     word processor, CP/M (8-bit CPU) AND CP/M-86 (16-bit CPU) (and
     I've been offered a Vector version of MS-DOS for only $80!)
*  1 Northstar S-100 Micro Disk controller board,
*  4 Northstar 16Kbyte S-100 dynamic RAM boards (fully populated),
*  4 Northstar 16Kbyte S-100 dynamic RAM boards (UNpopulated), and
*  2 Digital Group 16Kbyte static RAM boards.

I'd like to SELL everything, but whatever I do, I've got to make more
room in my computer "shack" for incoming stuff!  I've been offered a
mere pittance for four of the above boards; should I take it and run?

Does anyone know where I might find a KONAN DGC-100 hard-disk controller
board (and maybe a hard disk to go along with it)?  I'd like to add it
to my Z-100 using a device driver described in an article I clipped from
a mazagine several years ago.

Could someone tell me what BIOSR4 is?  I see it on CPM.C128 on SIMTEL,
but I only have mail-server access (no ftp here) and it won't let me
get it.  I would suppose it is an upgrade, but I have no idea.  

If it is worthwile, could someone either EMail it (UUE) or give me an
address where I could send a disk to???

I'm looking for a public-domain sort utility that can process large

Subject: Intel hex (*.HEX) format questions

Anyone have some cold, hard facts concerning the Intel .HEX format?
I've managed to figure out a little bit of it, and have come up with
this:

Each line looks like this

:10020000C30CDFC308DF7F00202020202020202007
^ ^   ^ ^^                              ^ ^
| |   | ||---8 * num bits - data bytes--| |
| |   | |                                 |
| |   | |    Checksum---------------------+
| |   | |
| |   | +----Always 0. Why?
| |   |
| |   +------16 bits - address to start
| |
| +----------8 bits - the number of bytes on this line
|
+------------always a :

Final line looks like this

:0000000000
^ ^   ^ ^ ^
| |   | | |
| |   | | +-------Checksum
| |   | +---------Always 0. Why?
| |   +-----------Address. Can be non-zero, but what does that mean?
| +---------------Zero bytes on this line
+-----------------Always a :

What I wonder is; What does the "always 0" byte do? Is it always 0?
What is the algorithm for computing the checksum? I believe it is
like this (in c, s is the line)

int i,csum=0;
for(i=1;i>length(s);i+=2)
  {
    csum^=((s[i]&15)<<4);
    csum^=(s[i+1]&15);
  }

What happens when the address in the last line (with 0 length)
is non-zero? Does that mean that the entry point is at the noted
address or something?

>Anyone have some cold, hard facts concerning the Intel .HEX format?

   I was going to email this to Mr. Sayer but it seems like something
 that many would like to know.

  There are two forms of Intel Hex format. One is often referred to as
 Intellect format, the other is Extended Intellec. I beleive that the
 former is also known as Motorala 'S' records.

 Intellect format:

 :100000007320457175697320446f7320457175693c
 
 : 10 0000 00 7320457175697320446f732045717569 5c
 |  |   |   | |--------- data ---------------|  |- check sum
 |  |   |   |-- record type, 00 = data, 01 = End record
 |  |   |-- start address for data
 |  |- number of bytes in record (normally ten, but last line may have less)
 |- start of a record, if you don't have this, line is ignored


 Extended Intellect format
   As above but recognizes a record type 02.  Record type 02 is followd
  by a four digit base address and the checksum. Addresses in subsequent
  type 00 and type 01 records are relitive to this base address.  This
  allows address up to FFFFF to be specified.

In both formats the checksum is determined by:
   remove start code and checksum from line ( :5c )
   add the remaining bytes together ( 10+00+00+00+73+20.......+69 = A4 )
   compilment and add 1 ( A4 xor ff = 5b, 5b + 1 = 5c ) 
   the result is the checksum: 5c
     This is an oversimplification. Remember to add the values in the bit
   stream (the actual binary values) and not the ascii values of the numbers
   that get printed to the record.  Don't forget to change the checksum
   into two ascii digits when tacking it on the the end of the record.

Hope this helps.

I recently purchased an IMSAI 8080 from a computer surplus store. In the box
were two cards for which I have no documentation. These two cards are:
	IMSAI  FIB rev3 and 
	IMSAI  IFM rev6.
These two cards are attached together by a ribbon cable and apparently
together form a floppy disk controller. They are vintage 1976 & 1977.
If anyone has any documentation on these boards, I would like to hear from you.
Port addresses and descriptions would be nice, schematics would be better.
Bios listings would be appreciated also.
I also purchased 3 IMSAI  RAM16 rev 1 cards. These cards work and have only

<Anyone have some cold, hard facts concerning the Intel .HEX format?

More particularly, he asked about the "always zero" field, the use of
the :0000000000 record, and how checksums are calculated.

The :0000000000 record is peculiar to CP/M and isn't rigorous Intel Hex.  
Intel Hex stuff is commonly ended with a :00000001FF record.  Note the
exception to being "always zero".  The eighth and ninth characters of a
record specify the record type.  Type 1 means either end of hex, or
starting address.  There are some Intel programs that generate a non-zero
address for the last record, because they actually start execution 
somewhere.  Usually, hex files are just used for burning EPROMs, so the
starting address is irrelevant (hence 0).

<What happens when the address in the last line (with 0 length)
<is non-zero? Does that mean that the entry point is at the noted
<address or something?

Yup, it's the address to start execution at.  Strictly speaking, this 
should be 0100 for CP/M stuff.   The CP/M way of botching this record
makes concatenation of several hex files easier.

<What is the algorithm for computing the checksum? 

If you add up the value of ALL the bytes on the line, the least significant
byte should be zero.  I include some code fragments from a program that
reads intel hex files.  This isn't vaporous code, it is pulled from a real
working, tested program.

William,

I do not have kermit for the Alspa, but I do have MDM740, which I use
extensively on my ACI-2DS.  It handles MODEM7/XMODEM protocol, and supposedly
batch mode (which I've never seen work, but I don't know if it's MDM740 or
the unix xmodem I'm using...). Let me know if you would like this - it is
at least *a* file transfer protocol...

BTW, who ported CP/M 3.0 to the system? That was never done while I worked
there, and after I left the company sank all its efforts (and everything
else) into the ACI-Zero! (Or is that the BIOS revision number? If the latter,
you might be interested in v3.6 - I've done numerous improvements to it in the
past few years, including ZCPR3 and P2DOS compatibility..)

Subject: C-128 info

For those who have requested info, I offer the following:

1.  nearly all problems associated with using a centronics printer with
CP/M can be fixed with CONF.  A P.D. program available from Simtel,
Genie, Compuserve, FOG.  The problem is that the system puts out
PETascii by default, and some characters are not direct translations.
What you need to do is get the system to put out true ASCII, and
convince the interface to do nothing.  Assuming a secondary address
of 5 does that for your interface (works for Cardco +G) you issue
CONF PRT1=ASCII5  I do it in my PROFILE.SUB file.  Just substitute
your sec. address for transparent mode for the 5.

2.  BIOS3 and BIOS4 are modified source code for generating a modified
CP/M+ system.  They take care of things like setting the system up for
ASCII (see above), eliminating all the 40 column drivers, etc.

3.  CP/M+ on the 128 can be speeded up significantly by using CONF to
shut off the 40 col screen, and reducing the baud rate.  Your terminal
program will reset it as needed.  The command is CONF 40COL=OFF,BAUD=75.
You can also use CONF to set some decent screen colors.  I use dark blue
screen with yellow text.

4.  If you have any questions I can probably put you on the right track.
I also have access to the SIMTEL, and will be happy to send any of
the Commodore specific stuff if you send a blank disk - just get in
touch.

Do you know of any sequencer software for CP/M ? Source is nessecary so
that I can modify it to go with my home-built hardware.

Please tell me if you know of anything like this.

For those who don't know what a sequencer is :

It's normally a box that can record the the key's you press on a synthesizer,
and play it back to the synthesizer, while you play another synth.

I have boot floppies/socs and BIOS sources for both the SD and DD Tarbell
controllers, they are both very late releases (1982/83).  I still use my
IMSAI with a DD Tarbell controller driving two Tandon 848-2 floppies.

 The 803H and the 803/TPC share common serial port setups, so it
might help to look for TeleVideo TPC comm programs or those for
just an 803.
 
 I have Modem7 for the 803, and can place it in the biaries section
for you if you like, or I can upload an overlay for the 803/TPC
here for you to patch into M7 (or MEX/IMP).
 
 It's really a common system, so it shouldn't be hard to find the
proper programs or overlays at your local RCP/M or GEnie, or
CompuServe, et al.
