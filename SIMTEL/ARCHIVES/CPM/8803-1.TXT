I didn't want this to go by completely unchallenged.  In the old days
(a whole couple of years ago) you couldn't get help from MicroPro.
They would tell you to go talk to whomever you bought from, and
wouldn't deal with customers directly.  However, since they failed to
keep up with the times and enhance their product (as opposed to
MicroSoft Word & the like) they got the stuffing kicked out of them in
the marketplace.  They seem to be serious about getting back though.
They have a bank of phones they man (or person :-) ) and have been
good about getting back to me with information.  They are also one of
the few companies still supporting us CP/M hackers with updated
products.

Anyway, I have no affiliation with MicroPro, I just have found them to
be reasonable people lately.  Your milage may vary.

	Unfortunately, Z80MU does not run the world's best Z80
assembler!!  There ia apparently a bug in the implementation of a rarely
used Z80 instruction that causes Z80ASM to bomb.

Subject: 22PUBLIC bug

Many people have by now either replaced their old DRI CCP completely,
or are using one of the PUBLIC patches which declare individual files
public.  Being lazy, I have been using the 22PUBLIC.ASM patch on
SIMTEL (from 1981) to make all .COM files on USER 0 accessible from
any other disk/user#.  

Over the years I have occasionally noticed that "certain" programs
would NOT always run correctly from other user numbers.  In particular,
MODEM7 would not run from any user number other than 0, although I
could set USER to 0, launch MODEM7, exit, set the USER to whatever
I wanted, and re-launch MODEM7 correctly.  Since this only affected
about 3 programs that I use with any frequency, and since it was
only a minor annoyance in the great antipathy of life, I mostly
ignored the problem.  

It didn't go away!!  (:-}      Late last night I got frustrated
enough to wonder why.

The problem is actually rather simple.  22PUBLIC traps "File Not
Found" returns when the CCP attempts to open a file for loading.
It then tries the same user number on disk A:, and then user 0
on disk A:.  If the file is not found after all that you get the
usual "?" error msg.  If the file *IS* found, however, it resets
the user number (so the running program will be in the correct
area) and re-enters the CCP load routine to finish loading the
now-open file.

The bug is that, if the file is greater than 16k (one extent)
the BDOS looks for the next extent in the WRONG user area!
The fix is simple -- just save the original user area, and
defer resetting the user area until after the load is completed.
The "patch" is more complicated -- there is not enough room
in the usual CCP patch locations.  I re-assembled CCP (from
an old disassembly) and that gave me enough room to restore
the user number in both the "command/load error" and "success"
routines.

Thought someone else might be interested.

SWV20 emulates CP/M 2.2 on machines running CP/M-86, MDM-86,
Concurrent CP/M and similar O.S.'s.  It requires an NEC V-20 or V-30

Subject: HELP with unarc16

I'm having trouble getting UNARC16.ARK to unpack itself. It
starts up ok and produces a couple of intelligible messages,
then it prints lots of noise characters across the screen and
after a bit it exits having unpacked nothing. The code looks
vaguely sane (ie I believe I've downloaded the file ok). I'm
attempting this feat on an Amstrad CPC6128 running CP/M 3.0.
Any hints, suggestions, etc? Thanx in advance...

Subject: query - S-100 CPU upgrade boards

I want to upgrade my S-100 bus CP/M system with a CPU board using
one of the new Z80 replacement chips. What board-level products
are available? Can anyone give recommendations and/or comparisons?

Since I want to maintain Z80 and CP/M compatibility, I am interested
in the Hitachi HD64180 and the Zilog Z180 & Z280 chips to get the
larger address space. I also want to be able to move up to ZCPR
when the versions supporting these chips become available.

My configuration is pretty much normal for hobbyist S-100 CP/M systems:

    Tarbell Z-80 CPU card with banked memory and serial I/O
    Tarbell floppy disk controller with 8 " SSDD drives
    192K static RAM
    SDS VDB8024 video display & keyboard interface board
    misc. serial/parallel I/O and clock/calendar boards

    CP/M Plus (v 3.0) in banked mode

I would like to replace the CPU board but keep everything else in place
to start with. I would be willing to add an external CRT terminal
and 5 1/4 floppies if that makes sense. Also, I have done enough
assembly language hacking on the BIOS that some of that is no
problem.

Since I suspect that others on this list have similar interests, I
suggest that responses be posted here rather than sent to me
directly.

Subject: wanted: term program

I own a Kaypro-10 (CPM) and I am looking for a VT-100 terminal emulation
program.  Currently, I run MITE but it's emulation is not very good.  Does
anyone have a program that would perform better?


Please reply by email.

Subject: New files uploaded to SIMTEL20 during February

The following is a complete list of CP/M-oriented files uploaded to
SIMTEL20 during the month of February.  The column labeled "T" (Type)
is the file format.  (7) means ASCII, (8) means binary.

Also available:

A list of all CP/M files (updated daily):
   PD1:<CPM>CPM.CRCLST - List with CRC values
   PD1:<CPM>CPM.ARC    - The above, ARChived (much smaller), binary(8).
   PD1:<CPM>FILES.IDX  - Similar to below, no descriptions, comma delimited

A list of many of the CP/M files, with descriptions, (updated monthly):
   PD1:<CPM.FILEDOCS>SIMCPM.IDX - Comma delimited list
   PD1:<CPM.FILEDOCS>SIMCPM.ARK - Same, ARChived (includes next two files)
   PD1:<CPM.FILEDOCS>SIMCPM.INF - Description of data fields in SIMCPM.IDX

You have got a dud UNARC16.ARK - mine unpacks fine on an Amstrad.

Just an off the cuff guess, but wouldn't there need to be
additional segmentation information?
Last time I hacked in 8086 Assembler (Has it been a year already?)
I seem to recall all of this stuff about groups, segments, and so on.

I'd check it out with Intel, but I'm sure there were some mods
to the HEX format for all of those goodies.

Why must it have its own printer port in addition to the PC's printer port?

I have a "Baby Blue" board at work.  I tried it in an AT in 1985.  It wouldn't
work.  I called the folks who made it and they said, yup it don't work in ATs,
and they weren't going to do anything to help.  They also wouldn't supply any
information like schematics, that could help me figure out how to make it work.

As someone else has noted, one of the hassles of using a Baby Blue board, is
that it requires a prepended header to your .COM file.

In addition to Z80MU, there is a program that runs 8080 (not Z80) programs as
is.  It requires the use of a V20 or V30 CPU which can actually run 8080
instructions.  For programs that don't use Z80 instuctions, it is much faster
that Z80MU, or my old IMSAI, because it doesn't have to emulate the 8080
instructions.  It actually executes 8080 code.

I can mail copies of the 8080 thing, or post if there are enough requests.

The other solution is offered by Micro-Interfaces.  They have drivers for
both CP/M-80 and ISIS using V20, V30, or their Z80 board.  I use their
ISIS driver with a V20.  I can't vouch for their CPM drivers.

Subject: 8" floppy disc repairs

I have a Z80 system with two ss-dd 8" floppies: one is a Shugart 800 and one
is a CDC Magnetic Peripherals.  The CDC drive has graduated from marginal to
bad - it refuses to read or format the last 20% of a disc (is the outside
of a disc the beginning?).  This is using 600K discs, I have not tried a
single density disc.

I thought of getting the disc aligned and phoned Xerox who said they charged
$80.00 per hour and threw away floppies in lieu of aligning them (I should
start prowling around their garbage can).

My next thought is to phone CDC and see if grovelling and money will get me
an alignment disc and a manual.  The third thought is to score one or more
Shugart 800's and use the CDC to hold the door open.

1. Any guesses on what gives in my drive?  (yes I cleaned it.)
2. What should it cost to align a drive and who does such work?
3. Where can I get a manual and an alignment disc?  (I own an oscilliscope).
4. What are 8" drives worth new/used/surplus today?
5. How much is disc performance affected by the power supply?

I anxiously await your enlightenment.

Subject: Re Mark Zinzow's request for MicroBee Kermit

Yes CP/M Kermit does run on a MicroBee - a colleague of mine has one
and uses kermit betweem it and his PC.  He warned that the only problem
he had found occurred when using the optional dual serial line (SCC)
ports on the memory card in place of the one on the mother board.  In
this case there are 3 serial ports on the machine which confuses the
poor wee beasite - solution is to disable the single mother-board port
and then all performs well up to 38400 Baud.

There exists - somewhere in the vicinity of "Public Domain" - a program
called PC-Alien (incl PC-Alien Jnr and MSA) for reading foreign CP/M and
MS-DOS diskettes on ordinary PCs.  This includes support for MicroBee
format 360KB diskettes and I have successfully used it for reading and
writing such.

Well, people, I'm at wits end from trying to get the new CP/M SYS (May'87)
1581 disk out of CBM.  Its been 3 1/2 months, 2 letters, about 8 notes on
CIS, and mucho phone calls to CBM in PA and N.Y..  Although they have
're-found' my order, and I still have my cancelled check, they (CBM)
now say that they are out of stock and can not give me a shipping date.

Customer Relations has suggested that I contact Digital direct or get a
pirated copy.  Digital won't sell me one, even if I tried to  locate
Digital's part number.

If I just used the '81 for pleasure I could be patient, but I use dBase and
W* for work.  The '81 .com files that I have downloaded from GEnie have
allowed me to utilize the CP/M features of the '81 but it sometimes crashes
and I lose data (I have about 2-3 Megs).  Can anyone out there help me deal
with this problem before I go clone?

---end forwarded message---

Note from Keith:  I can't believe that CBM's customer relations would recommend
getting a pirated copy.  CBM, you should find out who said that and have a
good talk with them.  Better yet, get some copies of this software in stock
and quit making people wait!

Subject: Info For Appliance Controller Needed

Hi.

   I just bought an Appliance & Light Controller (for Color Computer) at
the local RS (clearance sale).  Well, I've got a Model 4.  So the software
that is supplied with the controller won't do me a dingo's kidneys worth
of good.  But I should be able to make it work with the hardware that I 
have (shouldn't I??)  The controller plugs into the cassette port on a CC 
and I have one of the old 4's that has a cassette port.  So, in theory,
I should be able to plug it into the 4.

   But, I don't know what sort of signals the controller expects.  Is
there anybody out there who has played with the/a controller?  Any idea
where I might be able to find out more about it??

   Thanks in advance (:-)

I have recieved a lot of useful advice on my floppy drive.  The conclusion
is that I should try to clean it myself and then look for help if that fails.

I got a number of addresses of places that sell 8" drives for well under $50.
so I also think I will fill my other two slots - you can't hardly lose.  Take
six they're small.

Subject: terminal modes on C-128/CPM

Can anyone explain alt mode in CPM Plus on a C-128.  I have the
128 System Guide that came with the machine but it seems that
Commodore was quite terse with information concerning the CPM
side of the machine.  There is some metion made concerning toggling
the mode on and off but so far the alt key seems to make no difference
on anything.   I'm also interested in being able to change key definitions
from within a C program.  Any help there?
While I have you all here let me throw out another problem that I would like
to nail down.  I use two 1571 drives.  I usually have all the system and
utility files on drive A: and do my work on drive B:, having done a
"setdef a:,b:" to arrange my search path.  This is all taken care of by
my profile.sub file.  However, no matter which disk, brand or density, I
use eventually one or two files get corrupted on the A:drive.  I can copy
a new file over the bad one and it will run for a few sessions and then
the corruption occurs again.  Often the same files get corrupted but 
just as often different files get hit.  Too often the file is "submit.com".
Has anyone else experienced problems like this with their drives?
Thanks in advance.
Best,
Bob

	*this is NOT a flame!*
Thanks for bringing this up.  It reached me just in time, as i'd been
considering getting a C128 as a cheap spare CP/M engine.  From the data
you've provided, i have to wonder whether you are running anything that
requires bank switching?  Is that when the files show up corrupted?

I think i'll forgo the 128 and put a little more money into a machine
actually made to do the job.

Keith, I checked with the folks who handle the 3.5" CP/M disks, and
they are indeed out of stock.  They expect a new supply on 3/9/88 from
the production folks, and will take care of the 150 or so orders on
hand.  When production get backed up, everything else backs up, and
the people who staff the phones are the last to find out what's going
on.  Correction, I (engineering) am the last to find out what's going
on.

I'll pass the information regarding customer service on to their
supervisor.

If there is anything else I can help you with, please let me know.

Subject: Missing Digest Issues

Steve,

The issue numbers are sequential and consecutive.  However, I am told
that the mail queuing mechanisms in BITNET give preference to small
mail files over larger ones.  So, the large INFO-CPM digest messages
may arrive late and/or out-of-order.  Some may not arrive at all
because they are "too big."  If you end up missing digests after
waiting about a week, send a request for the missing issues to
INFO-CPM-REQUEST@SIMTEL20.ARPA.

Sirs;
I am in the military stationed overseas in Germany.  I am a DDN user but
my host does not have "FTP" capability and will not obtain it. I believe
that in the past you offered a service of copying the public domain
software to a tape in different formats if provided a tape and list
of desired contents.
Do you still offer this service? If I sent a 10 1/2 inch reel of 
blank tape, could you copy some public domain software on it
at 9 track, 6250 BPI in IBM format?
Thanks for your information on this matter.

connect to other people who are attempting to log on.  They will begin
to type typical Telenet prompts such as "Terminal =" and the "@" sign.
By observing your response, they can figure out which service you are
attempting to connect with (e.g. C PLINK..C DELPHI, C 202202) and then
they will type the appropriate prompts in order to get you to type in
your user I.D. and password.

Once they have your I.D. and password they will either disconnect or
give you some error message and ask you to try again.  In either, case
they CANNOT give you access to the system you are trying to access.

To safeguard against this type of theft you should be very wary of any
failed attempt you have in connecting to any online system through
Telenet.  If you have a failed connect attempt, we suggest you call
back IMMEDIATELY and change your password, if possible.

We recommend against automatic log-on procedures, if you use such.

Preferably, if you can do your online accessing through networks other
than Telenet, you should do so at this time.

Please note that those people participating in the above are engaging
in criminal activities.  Telenet is working with law enforcement
agencies and the telephone companies in order to locate and prosecute
the offending parties.

Please share this information  with others you come in contact with on
the other commercial networks.

Sorry, Keith, but it's the TRENTON COMPUTER FESTIVAL; Trenton State
College hosts the festival, but is in no way the only sponsor.  The
festival was created by the ACGNJ, and they intend that it retain the
"TCF" name.

To all:  calling TSC is a thankless task; they have but one secretary
for that phone, and when she's not there, no one picks up.  Someone will
probably post the schedule of events here, sometime soon.

Re z80mu.exe ( an MSDOS - gasp! - program )

When I run CP/M Turbo Pascal 3.0 under Z80MU on a (supposedly)
IBM compatible the screen codes ain't quite right. I have got
driver=ansi.sys in my config.sys file. Which screen driver
should I install from TINST.COM to get full screen compatibility?
Can anyone help?

Otherwise I can recommend Z80MU.EXE whole-heartedly to all half-
CP/M / half-MSDOS hackers out there. It thinks it runs like a 600 kHz
Z80 on a 8MHz 8086, and like a 1MHz Z80 on a 80286 - I can live
with that.

Subject: CP/M disk directories

Ok, all you CP/M mavens, here's a good question for you.  Not anything earth-
shattering, or anything like that... just irritating.

The scenario:  Disk B: is a DSDD 48 tpi drive.  It uses 8-bit allocation
groups, so 16 groups can be allocated in one directory extent.  The group
size is 2k, so each extent can address 32k.  That, I have no problem with.
What I have problems with is how the damn files are represented in the
directory.  A short example session follows.

This all started on comp.os.cpm (its my fault) but I am cross posting this 
to comp.sys.tandy for any interested Model 2 and Model 16 owners out there.

I asked for help fixing my 8" drive and then posted the results from which
I have received six mail requests for the names of companies supplying
eight inch floppy drives and in lieu of sending out all that mail, here is
what I have been told by you gentle readers:

	Electronic Supply Company

	Tektronix Country Store

	(503)627-6769

I have not tried any of these places as I have run up a big enough long 
distance bill lately and my wife reminded me that I have her and three
children to feed.

I still want to buy a drive so if any of you try these places, post the
results on such things as models, prices, and willingness to ship.  There
seems to be a lot of interest.

Subject: CP/M disk directories

I'm a little rusty at this, but let try any way. Here's an explanation
that seems to fit your observations:
1) The number of extents controlled by a single directory entry is 2
16k extents.
2) The total number of sectors covered by a single directory entry is
at most 80h in RC + 1*80h from the extent byte.
3) Thus your 2 directory entries cover 256 sectors for first entry
and 255 for second = 511.
  That is, the first directory entry in your system will have an extent
byte 0 if you have 80h or fewer sectors in the file. If you have between
81h and 256 sectors, the extent byte is 1, and the RC byte is the rest.

From: Paul.Birkel@K.GP.CS.CMU.EDU
Subject: SB180 help?

My apologies if this problem has been addressed in the past 6 or so months
that I've been off the INFO-CPM list.

I'm considering the purchase of a used Micromint SB180 configured with a
pair of DSDD 96tpi 5 1/4" drives. It's running a custom ZCPR3 from ECHELON.
Boots and runs fine off of a set of 96tpi disks. The problem is that it can
not read a disk formatted at 48tpi! This includes the original distribution
disks, and disks it has just formatted to 48tpi using the FVC (format, verify,
copy) utility. The same problem occurs when trying to read a disk in
KAYPRO II format (SSDD 48tpi), or using FVC to format such a disk. FVC is
perfectly happy in 96 tpi "mode".

In all such cases, I get a bad sector error, usually on track 1 sector 01
or something like 20. Booting from the distribution disks gives me the
system header message (like "ZCRP3 56k, etc") and then hangs. I do not
know if the ROM is producing this or not, but I would guess that it *is*
reading track 0 correctly since it is determining the system "size" correctly.
On the other hand, under some non-boot circumstances it fails on track 0
as well, so I'm not sure about this.

I thought that the problem may be that the system is trying to read the disks
in 96tpi mode, except that FVC when attempting to verify a disk formatted on
a KAYPRO II does produce a header correctly identifying the format, therefore
*must* be accessing the appropriate tracks. Just in case I changed the step
rate from 10 to both 6 and 20 ms. with no effect (except more noise in the
later case!!). I don't know of any other setable system parameters that might
affect this problem.

One could argue that the drive speeds have drifted leading to problems with
the distribution disks, but that does not explain identical behavior on either
drive, and the failure of FVC (which formats without complaint the appropriate
number of tracks and sides) to happily verify even a floppy it has just
formatted. One could argue that it's a write problem (on formatting), except
the distribution disks should be readable. If it were bit rot in the device
driver then I wouldn't expect *both* of two 96tpi system disks to exhibit the
same behavior.

The drives, I believe, are standard 55Bs (?). I have no documentation on
them. The SB180 docs describe jumpers which basically control things like
head load, motor control, and panel lights. The only board jumper has to do
with 8" vs. 5 1/4". So I don't think that there is a hradware configuration
problem.

As much as I otherwise like the system, I'm not purchasing it 'til I can
exchange data with it!! Unfortunately, the original owner died 3 years ago
and his brother is only now trying to sell it after gathering dust for the

Well,  not from within the program, but before with KEYFIG.  What you ought to

do  is  set-up  different  CP/M sys's for each of your different applications,

using  KEYFIG  to  define the keys as you would like them to be for each.  So,

you would have one CP/M boot disk for C programs, another for dBASE, etc.  Now

when  you  change  from  running one to the other it is not necessary to close

down and re-boot CP/M.  Merely run KEYFIG, have it get the new key definitions

you  want  from  the  new  CP/M  disk, have it define these new definitions as

current,  exit  KEYFIG, and as many keys, up to every key on the keyboard will

have been re-defined according to how you set it up with KEYFIG.  Changing key

definitions  with  KEYFIG  in  this  manner  should  take about 15-20 seconds,

allowing  for  load  time of the program, and then you are set to run your new

application,  with a newly re-defined keyboard. You could even have the second

CP/M  sys  on  another drive, from which you run KEYFIG, and avoid the need to

swap  disks.   For  additional  CP/M  sys's,  you may try using different user

areas, again avoiding any need for a swap of disks.

From  your  description  you give a pretty good hint as to where your prob is.

Whenever  you  use  the  profile.sub,  or  for  that matter any submit file, a

temporary  file  is  written to disk to perform that task, and then is erased.

My  quess  is  that you are not leaving enough disk space on your drive A disk

for this temporary file to be written, causing it to overwrite other things on

the  disk.   Submit  files  usually  do  not take up that much space, but as a

precaution,  I'll  always leave about 10-15k of empty disk space to accomodate

them.  (As  a  matter of interest, with DRI's new CP/M sys, for the #1581, any

submit file is easily identified, if you see: SYSIN57.$$$.  If the submit file

completed its task, this will have been erased,however.)

BTW,  if  you  are doing any serious CP/M tasks, you ought to consider getting

the  #1750  RAM,  and running from it. It speeds up run time multi-fold. (And,

then  you could add to your profile: setdef [temporary=m:], and your temporary

submit files will be written in RAM, speeding up their application, and saving

your disks.)

I called Echelon this afternoon (3/11) to check on the status of my order
for Turbo Modula-2 for CP/M-80.  I was told that the new version with the
bug fixes is due back from Borland "by the end of the month".  In early
February, I was told that it was due back by the end of February.  And
when I called in late December, I was told that the reason that my order
(sent in late November) had not shipped was because the manuals were being
reprinted.  The shipping date was then placed in mid-January.

Echelon also said that it probably would be useless to call Borland
direct, as they would deny all knowledge of this product.

Since Echelon has not cashed my check yet, I don't harbor any ill will
towards them.  It sure is annoying, though.

Subject: CP/M Directory Entries

his is the classic problem of logical vs physical.  In one case
extent' is used to refer to the contents of one directory entry (32K or
56 logical records -- physical records probably only 32 or 64!).  The
ogical extent is always 16K, and thus there can be two logical extents
n one physical extent, just as there can be 2 or 4 or 8 logical records
128 bytes) in each physical record.  The extent number in the directory
ntry is the number of the last extent in that directory, and the record
ount is the number of logical records in that last extent.  With larger
lock sizes on a hard disk it is quite possible to have 4 or probably
ven 8 logical extents per physical extent.  The same rules apply.

Subject: CP/M directory extents

Yes, directory calculations are confusing, and not helped by confusing
terminology!

The key point is to keep physical and logical extents distinct.

A CP/M LOGICAL extent holds 16K, or 80h = 128 records (each 128 bytes).

A CP/M file can have several directory entries.  Each DIRECTORY ENTRY
(i.e. 32 bytes in the first group(s) on a disk) has 16 bytes of space
for data group numbers; the group numbers must be words if there are
>255 groups on a disk. Thus:

A CP/M PHYSICAL extent (i.e., a single DIRECTORY ENTRY) may be hold
a multiple of 16K.

  The multiple depends on:
	(a) whether a group number is a byte or word
	(b) the size of one allocation group (1,2,4,8,16 K)
	(c) whether the format designer used all of the 16 bytes
	    available in a single directory entry

The RECORD COUNT BYTE gives the number of records in the HIGHEST
logical extent referenced by the physical extent/directory entry it
appears in.

Similarly, the EXTENT BYTE (and its overflow into the low-order bits
of the S2 byte) gives the number of the HIGHEST logical extent
referenced by the physical extent/directory entry it appears in.


examples:
(with S2 and EXT appropriately masked to remove internal bdos flag bits)

#1	S2  = 0,  EXT = 1, RC = 7fh 

	If there is 1 directory entry per logical extent, then
	this is the second directory entry; its final record is 7f=127.

	If there are 2 or more directory entries per logical extent
	this is the first directory entry; its final record is
	80h + 7fh = 255.

#2	S2 = 0, EXT =1, RC = 80h

	If there is 1 directory entry per logical extent, then
	this is the second directory entry; its final record is 80h = 128

	If there are exactly 2 directory entries per logical extent
	this is the first directory entry; its final record is
	80h + 80h = 256, and this entry is full.  

	If there are more than 2 entries per logical extent,
	this entry is not full; the next record would result in
	EXT = 2, RC = 1.

If the file is written sequentially, then we know in #1 that the file has
80h +7fh=255 total records.  If it is written randomly, all we know
(without inspecting the group numbers) is that there is at least one
record, the 255th; there may be others, including some in higher-numbered
extents.

In #2, assuming for example exactly 2 logical extents per directory
entry, there may be a second directory entry that is totally empty
(EXT=2, RC = 0).  This can happen when a sequentially-written file
is exactly 256 records long; the bdos internally closes the directory
entry, creates a new one, and then is told by the program to close the
file.

Regarding (c) above, several OEM's and ramdisk suppliers (Televideo,
SWP, ...) have defined disk formats that do not use all 8/16 group
slots in a single directory entry.  Apparently they weren't able to
distinguish logical and physical extents!  The result is unnecessary
extra directory entries for large files and additional headaches for
programmers.

COPYING random files (ones containing holes) is not so
straightforward, because the utility must determine how to handle a
destination disk that has a different allocation group size.  In the
general case, although the data records can be copied, I don't believe
a "perfect copy" is possible, because the destination copy may not
retain the same information about unwritten records that existed in
the original.  (Information about unwritten records is mostly inferred
from missing group numbers.)  This could conceiveably lead to errors
in a database program that relied on the "unwritten-data" error from
the bdos. (Consider, for example, copying a random-record database
from a 2K to a 4K group disk, and then copying it back to a 2K disk.)

   Actually, the byte you are calling the 'extent #' is handled a
little differently.  The LSB of this byte means 'add 80h records to
the record count byte', and the upper 7 bits, when shifted once to
the right, are the extent number.

   The '# of records' byte is never allowed to get larger than 80h,
so this method is needed to allow up to 256 records per extent.

Some examples:                    vv    vv
      extent 0,  127 records:     0000007F
         "       128 records:     00000080
         "       129 records:     01000001
         "       256 records:     01000080
      extent 1,  1   record:      02000001
         "       129 records:     03000001
         "       255 records:     0300007F

Subject: CP/M disk Directories

In message <2662@crash.cts.com> mwilson@crash.cts.com (Marc Wilson)
writes in some detail about a 511-record file (just short of 64K
bytes), which uses two directory entries on a floppy disk system with
2K-byte allocation block size (32K-byte extent size).

> What's going on here?!

What's going on is that you are confused about the RC (record count)
and EX (extent number) bytes in a directory entry.  This is
understandable, since the DRI (Digital Research, Inc.) CP/M 2.2
documentation only describes the CP/M 1.x case of 1K allocation
blocks and 16K extents.

In order to accommodate larger disk capacities, DRI altered the
meaning of these bytes in CP/M version 2.  They did this in a way
which is downward compatible with CP/M version 1.  The record count
for an extent is now split between the low 7 bits of RC and the lower
bits of EX.  The portion of EX which is used for the high part of the
record count is specified by the "extent mask."  A full extent is
still indicated by RC = 80h (with all extent mask bits in EX set).
I.e., the high bit of RC serves as a flag rather than as part of the
record count.  The true "extent number" is obtained by right-shifting
EX by the number of bits in the extent mask.

In your case, the extent mask is 1.  The two EX bytes (01h and 03h)
become 0 and 1 after shifting right by one bit.  The RC value (80h)
for the first extent indicates it is full (256 records).  The RC
value (7Fh) for the second extent is combined with the low bit of the
EX value to yield record count FFh (255 records).  This is as you had
expected.  No records are "lost" and the file is not "sparse" (no
unallocated extents.)

Note:  The above description is sufficient for disks with no more
than 512K-byte capacity.  However, two additional details must be
noted to completely describe the situation for larger capacity disks.
First, the upper 3 bits of the EX byte are always zero.  (The reason
for this is somewhat obscure:  Since EX participates in directory
scans by BDOS functions such as Open_File and Search_for_First, a
valid EX value must not match 3Fh, the ASCII code for the ? character
used as a "wildcard.")  Second, because the remaining 5 EX bits
(less, due to the extent mask) are insufficient for specifying all
extent numbers, the upper bits of the extent number overflow into the
S2 byte, which was unused in CP/M version 1.

To me, it's always seemed a shame that DRI went to such lengths to
preserve backward compatibility with older versions of CP/M and then
failed to properly document the changes.  I was only able to fully
understand the above by disassembling BDOS (many, many moons ago).
And I have seen many public domain programs that manipulate directory
entries break on hard disk systems due to a lack of understanding of
these details.

There is some confusion here between about the concept of an extent.

Originally, in cp/m 1.x (how's that for comp.archaeology) an extent
was, by definition, 16k.  This was because each dir entry showed the
location of 16 groups x 1k per group.  

With cp/m 2.x came a more flexible arrangement.  Groups can be up to
16k each.  It also became possible to use either eight or sixteen bit
directory addressing for each group; each directory entry still 
contains 16 bytes of group addresses, which may now address either 
eight or sixteen groups.

Thus an extent (the amount of a file handled by a single directory
entry) became variable.  However, to maintain compatibility with the
earlier versions of cp/m, the physical directory entries continue
to consider an extent as 16k (ALWAYS).  In other words, we now have
a physical extent, which might contain as much as 128k (16k group x
8 groups/dir entry), but our directory extent byte shows logical 
extents, which are always 16k!  In your example the logical extent
is 16k, but the physical extent is 32k.

Note that you have saved 2 physical extents, but 4 logical extents.

The RC byte shows the number of records (max 80h) in the LAST logical
extent for that directory entry.  Here, we'll have two logical extents,
ext 0 & ext 1, for the first dir entry.

      ^ --extent #0-- ^  ^ --extent #1-- ^

Since we have filled logical ext #0 and are into logical ext #1,
we know that we have 80h records in logical ext #0.  The RC byte
shows 80h records in logical ext #1, the last logical extent in
the dir entry.  Remember that the extent byte shows the LAST
logical extent in that directory entry, and the RC byte shows
the number of records in that last logical extent.

he SB180, especially with the XBIOS enhanced operating system and

or write 48tpi disks in a 96tpi drive.  However, an inexepensive solution
is to add a 48tpi drive to the system, and then you can read and write
48tpi formats to your heart's content, including mushdos if you buy the
UNIFORM product from Micromint.

I have an SB180 configured with 2 96tpi drives as A: and B:, and a 48tpi
drive as C:.  Works great.

Subject: Modem access fee proposal scrapped by FCC

From Pg. 6 of the Wall Street Journal for 17 March 1988.

        FCC SCRAPS PLAN TO CHARGE FOR COMPUTER
         ACCESS TO PHONE SYSTEMS, SOURCES SAY

   WASHINGTON - The Federal  Communications Commission
has quietly decided to  scrap  its plan to sharply in-
crease telephone  rates for computer users, agency and
congressional sources said.

   Last week, the agency informed  importamt lawmakers
that it wouldn't go ahead  with its plan to assess so-
called access charges of as much as $5.50 per hour per
user to hook up computer-communication networks to lo-
cal telephone systems.  An  FCC official described the
decision as a tactical move to placate opposition from
Congress and computer users.

   "They got the message loud and clear  from Congress
that this plan was a political and policy loser", said
a House  staffer who was informed of the FCC decision.

   The FCC's about-face is a big victory  for informa-
tion service companies, who  have contended that steep
access charges  would have drivem them out of business
by making  their  services  too expensive.  Currently,
computer-communications networks are exempt from those
access charges.  Computer  users  around  the  country
deluged the FCC with about 10,000 letters opposing ac-
cess fees, the most letters the agency has ever gotten
on a telephone issue.

   The decision to drop the proposal was  made  by FCC
Chairman Dennis Patrick  and the common-carrier bureau
of the  agency, the  sources said.  Mr. Patrick, whose
office wouldn't comment on the decision formally needs
the vote  of at least  one of the  agency's  other two
members to terminate a proposal.  But in  practice, he
can act unilaterally because, as chairman, he controls
which proposals can come to a vote.

   In any event, FCC Commissioner Patricia Diaz Dennis
said she supported  the  decision  to  end the access-
charge plan. "We've got a lot of things on our plate,"
she said.  That's one that would overcrowd it."

   Several agency officials described the FCC's action
as a way of  patching  up  its tattered relations with
Congress which is still fuming over the FCC's decision
to abolish the fairness doctrine.

   Last Thursday, [March 10] Rep.  Edward  Markey (D.,
Mass.), chairman of  the House telecommunications sub-
committee, said  he  would  introduce  legislation  to
kill the  access charge - even though agency officials
said they had assured the congressman's staff that the
FCC itself would kill the plan.  A Markey aide said he
was only  notified  an hour  before Rep. Markey was to
give a previously scheduled speech  on  access charges.
"We'll closely monitor the commission's future actions
to insure  that this onerous charge  doesn't re-emerge
in a new form", Rep. Markey said in  a  statement yes-
terday.

   Rep. Markey and other lawmakers  also  still oppose
Mr. Patrick's pet  plan  to radically alter regulation
of American Telephone & Telegraph Co.

   FCC and congressional sources said the agency would
proceed, but  slowly, with a separate  plan  to assess
charges of about  $4.50  per hour  per user to hook up
private telephone networks to local telephone systems.

   The FCC believes  that both computer-communications
networks and  private telephone networks aren't paying
their fair share of the cost of  local  telephone ser-
vice.  But exempting  computer-communications networks
has more  appeal  politically, because  the  users are
often consumers with  limited ability to pay increased
charges.

I agree that there's no reason to throw away your 8 inchers if
you're pleased with your system. But there are disadvantages.
The 1.2 meg storage can now be obtained from either 5" or
3.5 inch drives. In the case of the HD 5", I believe this
could be done with no reworking of the BIOS, since you would
use the 8 inch controller data rate to the 5" drive.

  One option if you change to 5" drives is to use the newer HD drives
usually found on the pc ats. I bought one for about $100. On my AT,
I can use it to read 360k ( 48tpi), 720k ( 96tpi QD) and 1.2 meg
(96tpi, HD) disks. I usually only write 1.2 meg floppies on it.

Hogwash!  Where did you here this rumour???

Being exposed to hundreds of 8" users over the past 8 years and using all
three formats (3.5, 5.25, 8.00) myself, I can safely state that NO format is
more reliable than another.

What DOES matter is the quality of the hardware (disk drive and, to some
extent, the disk controller).  Early 8" drives were lousy, but so where 5.25
for that matter.

Personally, I have had errors crop up on all three drives - and cleaning
solved the problem in all cases.  Alignment (if you don't have prehistoric
drives) is rare unless you play frisbee with them (or have a portable that
gets kicked a lot).

Small drives are better for one obvious reason: size.  But I use all three
since I get 1.3M on 8" disks and only 400-800k on 5.25/3.5 in the CP/M world.
8" drives are also 2x faster than 5.25 (if your skew factor is correct).

-Mitch

P.S.  8" drives are also nice for compatibility with other CP/M users,
although the Kaypro format is pretty well known also.

                           ^^^^^
I have many eight inch drives.  They don't give me any more trouble than 5-1/4"
drives.  The reasons people went to 5-1/4" drives are that they are lighter,
require smaller box, require less power, and that their *list* price was much
lower.  The biggest reason was price, not performance.  Only within the last
few years have 5-1/4" drives become comparable with 8" drives.

People did *NOT* go to 5-1/4" drives for "better" reliability.  The 5-1/4"
drives were initially plagued with problems, especially with cramming too
many bits on too little media.  8" drives using MFM (ordinary double-density)
have been able to hold 1.2M starting over *TEN* years ago.  They didn't
have to pull any tricks.  They also have *twice* the transfer rate of the
same density of 5-1/4" drives.

Please don't poo-poo 8" drives just because there are big, ugly, or
unfashionable.  They work.

For someone who already has the cases, power supply, and controller for
8" drives, it is cheapest to keep them because people almost give 8"
floppies and drives away.  A friend gave me a pair of brand-new
Shugart 801-R's for free last year.  I've seen them go for $5 to $25
at flea markets.  Business are *throwing* away 8" floppies where no
one knows better to grab them for home.  At flea markets they go for
20 cents a piece.  Floppies usually appear at flea markets in lots of
50 to a few hundred.  I have enough 8" floppies to last me a long time.

For many people with 8" drives, converting over to 5-1/4" drives is dumb.
It's expensive.  They'd typically have to buy the drives, enclosure, power
supplies, and a new controller.  That's quite a few bucks, and for something
that is inferior.  It's a hell of a lot of hassle to convert the BIOS of
the old S-100's to a different controller.  It's a hell of a lot of hassle
to convert the 8" floppies to 5-1/4".

Agree with Jim that there is no real need to dump 8" drives.
I've got a hybrid with both on my CPM workhorse.

But there is one additional reason that 8" can be a liability
in certain situations.  The drive motor is the only thing in
the whole computer that does anything with 60 Hz.  Aboard ships, we
had to trade our 8 inchers out because when the cooks fired up
the stoves in the galley for breakfast, we got cycle sags.
Which changed the drive speed.  The result was what we called
'data smear', a phenomenon that made you a believer in backing 
up your work.

5" drives, which run on DC only don't have this problem (true for
both hard discs and floppies).

I've always heard that 8" was MORE reliable.  Besides, they transfer data twice
as fast as 5.25" (except for the AT-type high-density drives).  Our locally
owned computer store here in West Lafayette, IN still has 8" disks on the
shelves.  And I still see them advertised in some of the catalogs I get
(e.g. Central Computer Products' "CP/M Times" catalog).

Ah this brings up something I was wondering about.

What CP/M clubs still exist?  Magazines that remember CP/M?  How about user
groups?

I can only read pre 1986 issues of DDJ for so long.

While I'm going on like this can you still buy new S-100 cards anywhere or
unconfigured versions of CP/M from DRI or anybody else?  It idly occured
to me that I have a 64K 8085 S-100 machine buried somewhere in the basement
that I could put a floppy controller into and run CP/M on.

Oh one more thing Philip, I don't think I'll turf my 8" drives - new drives
and floppies cost money which I would rather spend elsewhere and reliability
is unimportant at my house.  Besides, I'm a luddite, I don't like 5-1/4
drives.

Robert, although I reallize that 8" floppies are still good, but because you
cannot find them hardly anymore I think you should get rid of your 8" floppy
disk drives, but before that get 5 1/4" disk drives then get bunches of
5 1/4" disks and copy your library over to the 5 1/4" disks and then get rid
of your 8" disks and disk drives if you can.  Another reason I say this is I've
heard that 8" disks and disk drives are unreliable.  I don't know if this
is true or not but it's a rumor I've heard.

There are a lot of fallacies there.  8" disks are still readily available,
and commonly used in commercial word processors.  Contrary to your remarks
about reliability, 8" disks are notoriously more reliable than their
5.25" counterparts.  They typically contain more data, and transfer
faster, than 5.25" drives of comparable density and data capacity.

It would not be feasible to replace the 8" drives on my NEC APC with
5.25" drives.  I couldn't tolerate the reduced capacity and slowdown.

My solution was to add 8" drives to my XT clone.  With those, and
Uniform, I can accomodate a lot of different 8" formats.

Incidentally, I'd love to know where I can get new 8" DSDD disk
drives for $ 50.  That's a real bargain.

I sympathize.  Since the half height drives came out years ago, there
has been an easy solution.

All the 8" half height drives that I know about ran on DC only.  One
does need a hefty +24V supply for such beasts though.  Unfortunately,
these are still more expensive even at the flea markets than full
size 8" drives.  

Caveat: I bought a Tandon 848-2 brand new @ $450.  Tandon's 8" drives
were plauged with a long motor startup speed stabilization period.
Their drives would signal that they were up to speed before they should.
Some of the solutions to this problem were to delay the assertion of that
signal in hardware, or to add some kill time loop in software.  Another
solution was configure them to run all the time.  Unfortunately, this
drive always had the head loaded, so this was not a nice solution.  The
best solution was to get Shugart half height drives.  The had a direct
drive motor that would get up to speed very quick without fluctuating.
If any of y'all consider getting half height 8" drives, get Shugarts
if you can.  They had the feel of quality to them in many ways.  I
always heard good things about them, although I have no empirical
experience of my own with them.

For folks in 50Hz areas, there were typically two ways of doing AC 
motor stuff.  Some manufacturer had a dual pulley on the motor.  You'd
loosen the set screw, pull off the pulley, turn it over, put it back
on, and tighten the set screw.  The other (obvious) way was to have
a 50Hz motor.  The fifty Hz folks sometimes lived in areas where the
power line frequency varied, putting them in the same boat :-) as you
were in.

It has been my understanding that there isn't anyone making 8" drives
anymore.  When Qume quit making 8" drives a year or two ago, I remember
comments that they were the last manufacturer.

8" drives *are* available, but not necessarily readily.  There are
surplus dealers who have them ready for a signficant price.  If you
want it cheap, you have to wait for the right opertunity at a flea
market, or a friend or company unloading their old stuff.

He's not joking!  A friend of mine did this also!  He can put 1.2M
on his 8" MS-DOS disks, and also read many various CP/M formats into
his XT!  It's very handy.  BTW, genuine IBM floppy controllers have a
DC-37 connector for external drives.

The Trenton Computer Festival and Dayton Hamvention are your best prospects.
Last year a BIG stack of 8" drives went for $5 each.

Also look in Computer Shopper.

Being a relative novice in the telecommunications area, this may be a stupid 
question, but is 'anonymous FTP' something that we, in the CP/M world can 
participate in directly.  Most of the modem telecommunications software that
I know of supports XMODEM protocol, and of course, there is KERMIT, which
has its own protocol.  I thought FTP was a separate and distinct protocol.
Do we need to have the FTPing done thru a *nix system, or can we FTP with a
CP/M system?  If someone knows the answer to this, I would appreciate
hearing what it is.  Thanks.

(Sigh) I understand.  There is a magazine that still tries to cover S-100

they are still S-100 hackers.

Another good magazine until bought by M&T publishing was Micro-Systems

companies that bought them, screwed them up.

You can still buy new S-100 stuff from a bunch of folks.  Be forewarned:
They don't get any significant business from hackers, so their attitudes,
support, and prices reflect that.  They sell primarily to OEMs for
controller applications.

The following S-100 folks advertised in March issue of Micro/Systems Journal:
Macrotech (80386 CPU), Digital Research Computers (miscellaneous old stuff), and
M&T Publishing (Book: Interfacing to S-100/IEEE 696 Microcomputers).

I can't find my recent S-100 Journal issue.

If you ever want to move your computer to a place which has 50Hz power (like
Europe), make sure you get 8" drives where the belt-driving wheel on the
spindle motor has two seperate "tracks"; than you can take the wheel off and
just reverse it to change 50 <-> 60 Hz. The funny part is, not even all Siemens
drives (built in Mexico for the US and German market) have these reversible
wheels.

True. Single-side single-density 8" floppies are nearly indestructible.
Usually, if a floppy fails, you can actually see a hole in the magnet layer,
and sometimes even a hole in the disk ! Even scratches and fingerprints on the
recording surface are sometimes survived.

I think there is a much more important advantage of 8" drives: you can always
buy and interchange software on "eight inch, SSSD, IBM format"; it is sometimes
(usually ?) hard to interchange information on the myriads of 5" formats. The
biggest disadvantage of 8" disk drives (according to my bad taste) is their
noise level; in particular if you don't outfit them with a motor-off circuit;
my computer sounds like a starting jet in mty office.

We didn't want to announce this prematurely, but for users who
are considering system upgrades...

ZCPR version 3.4 upgrades for BOTH CP/M 2.2 and CP/M 3 (CP/M Plus) are
in final beta-testing and should be available in early April.

The CP/M 3 version is called Z3PLUS.  Installation requires no
assembly and minimal configuration.  It should run on any
Z80 CP/M 3 computer and has been tested on C128, Morrow MD5 and
WaveMate Bullet.

The CP/M 2.2 auto-install version is new ZCOM, vers. 2.0.  It also
requires no assembly and has been tested on a good variety of
computers.

All system files containing code are relocatable and most are directly
interchangable between different systems, and between cp/m 2 and cp/m 3,
regardless of system addresses.  System sizes can be changed
"on the fly" to maximize tpa when required.  Most Z utilities will
run on both cp/m 2 and cp/m 3 systems; some require upgrading
to handle cp/m 3 differences, and that work is in progress.

What is ZCPR ?  A Z80 Command Processor Replacement...that has evolved
into a highly integrated, configurable, extensible enhancement of the
CP/M command interface...spawned hundreds of companion utilities...is
the focus of most new CP/M-compatible programming ... for more

Subject: Does C128 really have CP/M?

Yes, the C128 really does have CP/M.  It is the version of CP/M known as
CP/M 3.0 or CP/M Plus, and most existing PD software does indeed run on it.
At 2 Mhz., you might find that it runs a bit more slowly than you have come
to expect from faster CP/M machines, but in the vast majority of cases I've
experienced, speed is adequate.  Some CP/M 2.2 software will not run under
CP/M 3.0 (C128 or any other) without modification (for example, programs which
exploit direct BIOS calls, such as a disk sector editor, as well as programs
which touch upon the rare incompatibility between those CP/M versions).  In
most cases of such programs, a separate CP/M 3.x version already exists.
Will the 128 really be useful to you in CP/M mode?  The only way to answer
that is to try it out and see for yourself.  CP/M will never be as flashy as
it's successors (MSDOS, UNIX, etc.) because it was designed for much more
humble machines.  That impressive 16-bit or 32-bit software you've been playing
with is memory hungry and can't be shoe-horned into a CP/M style machine.
Still, CP/M on the C128 can get most of the same jobs done quite well if you
can live without the flashy graphics and sound.

Subject: FTP

The term "FTP" stands for "File Transfer Protocol", one of several high level
protocols in use by the TCP/IP networking standard used by internet hosts
(those on ARPANET, MILNET, and all the zillions of subnets at local sites).
The term "Anonymous FTP" refers to the capability of some hosts (Columbia being
one) which will allow access to some of their files with a generic logon
(i.e. USER=anonymous, PWD=guest).  This facility is only available if one is
calling Columbia through the internet facilities (i.e. from a machine tied in
to the internet - it's operating system is of no consequence).  It can't be
accessed via dialup lines or the Usenet.

The reason for this confusion is that this newsgroup originates on the ARPANET/
MILNET side as "INFO-CPM", but is gatewayed to the equivalent Usenet
group (comp.os.cpm I believe).  I did not mean to imply that the average
Usenet user could access Columbia's Kermit archives via FTP; I only meant to
answer the original query from an internet user.

I believe Columbia has set up alternative access methods for the same set of
Kermit files (possibly on a different machine) so that non-internet users
can obtain the necessary files.  Unfortunately, I don't have any details on
these alternative methods.  The proper way to obtain this information, I
suspect, is to post a query to the newsgroup INFO-KERMIT (or it's Usenet
equivalent "comp.protocols.kermit").  There is also a newsgroup TCP-IP (comp.
protocols.tcp-ip) for those who want to know more about FTP and the like.

I have seen a few questions posted asking for opinions on C128 CPM.
We have several C128 machines in the building.  I find them CPM mode
extemely frustrating.  They are agonizingly slow.  The screen updating
is agonizingly slow, and the display itself is very difficult to read.
Forget programming on it.  Forget doing any sort of hardware interfacing.
Support from Commodore?...Heh, heh, tell me another one...
The disk accesses are serial at 19,200 (I think), and so are sloooow.
It used to break frequently.  Try finding a warranty center locally.
A place may advertise Commodore authorized service center, but all that
means is they fix Amigas.  They will be happy to take your money to
TRY to fix the C128. Parts availability?  Forget it.  As I said, a very
frustrating machine.  I refuse to use them personally, and, on my 
recommendation, my office does not support them anymore, and strongly
discourages their use, and will not approve their purchase.  Oh, and we were
staunch supporters of the Vic20 and C64.

My recommendations for CPM machines are as follows:

1. Find a dedicated CPM machine, Kaypros, Ampros, and the like.  Visual
Technology made a model 1050 that can be had inexpensively; a couple of hundred 
dollars less than the C128 system, and it is a far better machine.  (Email
me if you are interested in the VT1050.  I know where a couple are available).

2.  If you have enough money allocated for a C128 system, forget the C128 and 
buy an SB180FX from Steve Ciarcia's company, I forget the name.  
He writes for Byte.

3.  There are some software emulators in the public domain for MS-DOS
machines.  They are slow, but obviously the price is a lot cheaper than than a
C128, and they can't be much slower than a C128. 

Hope this helps.  If I can be of further help Email me.

Subject: CPM upgrades, etc.

Phillip Keen asked for opinions on CPM3.  Here's my two cents:
I first learned CPM on a CPM3 system.  I found it very clumsy.  I then 
at the suggestion of several folks 'downgraded' to CPM 2.2.  CPM2.2
is, to my mind, far more straightforward to use, and definitely a lot
easier to program for than cpm3.  I rewrote, er, adapted, the BIOS from
the CPM3 into the CPM2.2 BIOS that I now use.  I then a short time later,
at the suggestion of the same people, installed ZCPR3 from Echelon.
It was a straightforward procedure underCPM2.2. It was impossible under
CPM3. Oh, and I have found compatibility problems between 2.2 and 3.
Bottom line:  If one is going to use another CCP (highly recommended),
use your cpm2.2.  I strongly recommend ZCPR3, but there are others.
I would not even waste my time with CPM3 even if they gave away free
food with it.

Hope this helps.  E-mail me if I can be of further assistance.

I have a C128.  I run both native and CPM+ mode frequently.

For $20 I received a 2"-thick manual and two more disks.  The system is
complete and well documented.  Do you have this manual?

Yes, I'll admit the screen is slow, but agonizingly?  I wish there were
a way to speed it up.  Maybe the Z80A can be substituted by a faster Z80?
As for the letter quality, I don't find the 8x8 dot
matrix all that bad.  Try adjusting the color or intensity.

> Forget programming on it.  Forget doing any sort of hardware interfacing.
Excuse me, I've had no problems programming a CPM system with complete
BIOS-- I run VDE and MAC just like anybody else.  SID is available with
lots of doc.  Higher languages are available from SIMTEL20 or RPICICGE.

> Support from Commodore?...Heh, heh, tell me another one...
No problems here either.  I get help from comp.sys.cbm (mostly Frank 
Prindle).  Commodore has helped me when I've needed it...

> The disk accesses are serial at 19,200 (I think), and so are sloooow.
Actually the speed is closer to 5 to 6 times that.  If you really want
a fast system, the 512k RAM expansion is about $160.  Use it as the
system drive M: and SETDEF M:,*.  The 1581 3.5" drive is available for a 
little more, and is of course faster than a 1571.

> It used to break frequently.  Try finding a warranty center locally.
I have had a C64 since Jan '84 and a C128 since Oct '86.  ONCE I had
to have my 1541 repaired.  I had no trouble finding help in Milwaukee.
Mayfair Computers even does warranty repairs!

>                    Parts availability?  Forget it.
Try writing to comp.sys.cbm, will ya?  I've read articles advertizing
for video expansion RAMs, C128 and 1571 bugfix ROMs.  In any issue of
Commodore's or Compute!'s magazines for C128/64s, there are more ads
for hardware.

Every once in a while I hear someone take a personal vendetta against
Commodore, ragging about everything they do.  At least TRY to be objective.
These people hang out in dealer stores and ravage about everything Commodore 
does.  I swear some of these people must secretly work for Atari...:-)

> My recommendations for CPM machines are as follows:

I would have missed out on C128 native mode and C64-mode (for games ;-))
if I did that.  That's a lot of software.

  The one thing I would add to Lee's list of comments is that, if our
situation at MIT is typical, there are a LOT of used Osborne 1s around
being used as doorstops.  They are good machines, pretty reliable, 
reasonably well supplied with available software, and (subjectively and
around here at least) appear to be easier to get serviced than the C128.

Subject: CPM/M 3.0 vs. 2.2

Phillip Keen recently questioned the advantages of upgrading to
CP/M Plus (3.0) over 2.2 . Since Lee Thomison spoke (typed?) out in
favor of version 2.2, I thought I would add my views in the
other direction.

I have been using version 3.0 for about three years and would not
switch back to 2.2 for any reason. I run an S-100 bus system with
192K of RAM.

advantages of 3.0:

	- supports banked memory
	- put much of the system in bank 0, TPA in bank 1
	- increase TPA space ( 48K to 60K in my system)
	- allows BIOS additions without decreasing TPA space
	- time/date stamping of files
	- disk buffering in banked memory
	- cleaner command set (in my opinion)
	- residnet system extensions (RSXs) allow loadable
	  device rivers, system extensions, etc. much like
	  TSR's in MS-DOS.

I must admit that everything is not wondeful. I use a CCP replacement
call CCP+ to have an improved shell and a SideKick-like utility
called Write-Hand-Man. Many of the advantages above have been
implemented in other ways my various manufacturers or PD software
writers, but not in any standard fashion.

CP/M 2.2 is the standard work-horse version. If you don't have extra
memory or don't want the features made possible in 3.0 by memory
banking, switching to 3.0 isn't worth much.

ZCPR3 provides a nicer environment than either one. I bought ZCPR3.3
and tried it out. But I decided to stay with CP/M 3.0 because the
disk caching and larger TPA made lot's of stuff faster. There is 
supposed to be a version of ZCPR coming out this spring that runs
on CP/M 3.0. This desires some attention. I may go that route myself.

Ther have been some complaints of incompatibilities between CP/M
version 2.2 and 3.0 . I run many commercial programs written for
2.2 with no problems. The only place I have seen any is with
some PD software that goes to the BIOS directly or makes assumptions
about the file structures beyond what is provided at the BDOS
level. SD is the only program I use that had this problem and it was
fixed in later versions. There is also something called 22RSX
that claims to provide complete version 2.2 compatiblity if you need
it. I haven't had call to use it, so cannot comment.

For me CP/M 3.0 is the way to go. For anyone else - make up your
own minds. But first ask yourself what you want the system to do
and what is important to you.

JetFind, a tool I wrote for cp/m z80 machines, may serve your needs.

JetFind searches multiple files, with optional output redirection.
The files can be in ascii text or WordStar format, stand-alone, squeezed,
crunched, or any of those in a LiBRary.  The search pattern(s)
may be regular expressions (equivalent to unix's "grep").  The matched
lines are displayed, optionally with surrounding before-and-following lines.
Command-line, interactive, or script-driven control.  And it is fast.

I agree, and I apologize for contributing to the confusion by use of
misleading terminology and (as I now realize) some innacuracy in my
previous posting.  In particular, my statement was *incorrect*, that
RC = 80h implies a full "extent" (meaning PHYSICAL extent, or directory
entry).

Yes, that certainly is the key to understanding CP/M directory entries.
Thank you for the clear explanation, Bridger.

[I think my mind was in the same place as those designers who failed
apparently to distinguish logical and physical extents, by not using
all 16 bytes of the allocation group number area.  Several years ago,
I puzzled over the DPB extent mask in a system (Zenith Z-100?) which I
believe falls into this category.  Only now, after reading your note,
do I understand that particular diskette format!]

If your appliance decoder is the same as the one I bought from Radio Schack, 
it  is simply a BSR X-10 controller with Radio Shack's name on it.  I bought 
mine on  clearance sale a year ago.  There are adapter cables available to run 
off of RS-232 ports.  In addition, there is a programming guide available.  I 
got my RS232 cable and programming guide from DAK when I ordered 
another controller from them.  If you will send me a US mail address, I will 
send you a copy of the programming manual, if I can find it.  I will also 
Email you the pinouts for an RS232 cable when I find the manual.  You might 
also contact DAK and see if they will sell you an RS-232 cable and manual, in 
case I can't find mine.  (Hmmm, come to think of it, I may contact them to 
see if I can get a cable and software for my Mac...).

Please write back soon, as I am never certain about these internet mailings.

Any of you that are searching for 8" floppies can substitute any
5-1/4" floppy dirve that is shurgart 475 equivalent.  Build an adapter
cable and pull the hi-den line TRUE.  Now you have an 8" drive in
5-1/4 clothes.  Getting 1.2 Mbytes out of one of these small beaties is
very nice and with the addition of some control you can even handle
780 Kbyte diskettes and read 48 tpi ssdd and dsdd diskettes.  There are
also supposed to be some 3-1/2" drives that will give the same
performance on the same interface.  

Think of it more choices!

Is there a network discussion group, similar to this one, that

I am frequently called upon to design and fabricate a wide variety of 
electronic devices ranging from simple amplifiers to wierd filters 
to digital syncing stuff to dedicated intelligent controllers
to...well, you get the idea.  Anyway, even though I am the best hotshot
designer I know :-), there are times when I get stumped, and would like
advice, guidance, or even (especially) a better idea.  Normally I would go
over to the EE dept, but their emphasis is on antenna or well-logging.
If there is a discussion group that I could bounce ideas off of,
it would help me considerably, and perhaps even help them.

Thanks to all for your assistance on Columbia.

I have found that the "host" address was changed, and that was my
problem.  Everything is fine now.

Thanks again

John
PS.   For  anyone  interested,  I  am  now  running  CP/M-86 on a
Commodore B-256/80 and it runs almost all the software  available
from  Simtel20.  It is a little slow, and there are some problems
with speed, but its better than not having CP/M at all.

PPS.  The 8088  co-processor  will  also  run  MS-DOS.   I  think
Commodore dropperd a very capabile machine when they discontinued
this model.

By all means, forget about cp/m 3.0 (cp/m+).  You will have both installation
and compatability problems, with very little clear gain.  Get a copy of 
ZCPR 3.3 (Z33) and either 1) install it with your cp/m 2.2 system, or
2) also install ZRDOS (I believe 1.9 is the current version).  Z33 is the ccp
(console command processor) replacement; ZRDOS replaces the Digital Research
bdos in cp/m 2.2.  You may replace either or both.  I suggest both; you will
have a far more powerful and flexible system than you would under cp/m 3.0,
or indeed than anything Digital Research ever dreamt of.

Z33 is public domain; you will find it on a number of RCPM's (Remote CP/M
System) around the country, or, you can buy it from Echelon, Inc. (at a
modest cost) in either an auto-install version, which works on most, but not
all, systems, or a manual install version (which makes for a more versatile
installation).  To do the manual installation, you will need a working
knowlege of the insides of cp/m, and some modest ability with z80 assembly
language.  I believe you will also need the ZAS assembler, also available
at modest cost from Echelon.

ZRDOS is a commercial product, available from Echelon.  Also modestly
priced; I believe around $50.  There are also several public domain bdos
replacements available, with varying combinations of features.

The contact point for Echelon given above is old.  Their current contact
is:
	Echelon, Inc.
	P.O. Box 705001-800
	South Lake Tahoe, CA  95705

From: Raymond Carter  STEWS-NR-AS 678-3348 <rcarter@wsmr02.ARPA>
Subject: C128

I'd like to put some of the comments about the C128 in perspective
here, if I may.

First, I don't believe anyone ever claimed it was the world's best and
fastest CP/M machine, although I find it quite nice with the 512K
ram disk.  Also, by using the CONF utility it is possible to speed
up system operations by about 35% - puts the effective Z80 rate at
about 2.3 MHZ.

Second, I do claim that it is one of the most versatile computers on the
market.  It runs two of the largest bases of software available - C64,
and CP/M - without any additional investment.

It also does some pretty reasonable graphics.  The builtin software
supports 320 by 200 color graphics.  I have recently seen a package
called BASIC 8 which does really nice 3D 640x200 graphics.

All the sound and graphics capabilities are available from within
CP/M.  I have built a CP/M COMAL graphics package which supports
720x240 graphics on the RGB screen.  Not many other CP/M machines
will do that!

To sum up - it may not be the ultimate CP/M computer, but is an extremely
versatile computer, with MUCH good software available.

Subject: Clarification on ZCPR33 and Z System

Dave Goodman posted a message recommending ZCPR33 as the CP/M upgrade
of choice.  As the author of that code, I wholeheartedly concur. 
There were some statements made in that message, however, that I would
like to correct and/or amplify.
 
>> Z33 is public domain; you will find it on a number of RCPM's (Remote
>> CP/M System) around the country, or, you can buy it from Echelon, Inc.

>> need the ZAS assembler, also available at modest cost from Echelon.
 
First, Z33 is NOT really public domain; it is copyrighted by me and by
Echelon.  However, there is no royalty charge for personal
(noncommercial) use.  For that use it is distributed on many remote
access computer systems, including my own Z-Node.  There is a license
fee for use of Z33 with a commercial product.
 
Second, the autoinstall versions of Z System (combined ZCPR and ZRDOS)
that are about to be released (NZCOM for CP/M 2.2 systems and Z3Plus
for CP/M 3 systems) are far MORE VERSATILE than a manual installation,
as well as being completely automatic.  It is true that there are some
computers on which they will not work (though not very many, and on
some of those it is very hard to get a manually installed version to
work either), but when they do work you get a system in which the
operating system features (and corresponding operating system size)
can be varied dynamically to meet your requirements, on a permanent
basis or on a command-by-command basis.  For normal operation you can
have a complete Z System with all the bells and whistles at a cost of
about 6K of TPA space.  But when you need to run a memory-hungry
program, the operating system can be made to shrink (all the way
back to plain CP/M if desired) to provide the extra memory and then
expand again when that application has completed.
 
The main difficulty encountered with these systems is that some
configuration utility programs provided by the computer manufacturer
that work by performing absolute modifications to data in the BIOS
often will not work properly under NZCOM or Z3Plus.  Those utilities
can be fixed, if necessary.  Usually, however, they are used only
rarely, and you can shut off the automatic Z System long enough to use
them.  I will be speaking at the Trenton Computer Fair on these new
systems.  They will include, by the way, version 3.4 of ZCPR, which
includes a number of interesting and useful new features.  Z34 will
not be made available over remote systems; it will be available only
as a commercial product but at a very modest cost.

Subject: CP/M search facility

I don't have any experience with Bridger Mitchell's search utility,
but there is a commercial program called Electra-Find which was
implemented on both CP/M and DOS.  The DOS version has been upgraded
to Text Collector, but I assume the CP/M version is still available.
The utility allows searching for any text (or binary) strings,
with very powerful wildcard capabilities in both the string being
searched for and in the specification of what to search.  The
program comes from:

O'Neill Software

I have no connection with O'Neill - I bought Text Collector recently.

I disagree strongly with this opinion of CPM 3.0.  I started with 2.2
(where I wrote my own BIOS, etc...I did everything down to the nitty
gritty level), and then upgraded to 3.0 (when DRI released it, and I
bought the "generic" upgrade kit).  Documentation was good, and a million
times better than 2.2 .  Performance was also a million times better with
3.0 than with 2.2.  There are SOME incompatiblities, but very few, and
generally not too important.

CP/M 3.0 had most of the improvements that the original MS-DOS "did"
to CP/M. :-)

With the additon of CCP+ (in simtel20...) and full usage/knowlege of the
improvements, I'd say 3.0 is MUCH MUCH MUCH MUCH MUCH better than 2.2.
To tell the truth, my CP/M+ develoment environment looks more like BSD
Unix ("make", grep, VERY compatible library, etc) than CP/M (which I like
BTW).

To give you an idea of what I'm using:

	1) My system is a "homebrew" Z80H one with 1Mb of 0-waitstate
	   banked memory (someday with a Z280 if I can't afford an Amiga
	   2000 first).  My CP/M+ is the *banked* version.  The *unbanked*
	   version may be different in usablity.

	2) My bios (that I wrote) implements 720K of FAST/DMA'd ramdisk
	   and about 180K of my OWN floppy-disk cache on top of DRI's
	   (didn't fully like their algorithm).

	3) I modified the library of my C-Compiler (Manx Aztec) to
	   dynamically check for CP/M 3.0, and if it is "true", to use
	   3.0-only features that makes the floppy access (never mind the
	   disk cacheing) 3 times faster than 2.2 on the same disks (I
	   did many other things to my compiler, but that's another
	   story).


Because, however, DRI does not really sell CP/M 3.0 anymore (that I can
tell), 2.2 and ZCPR may be the best choice to go to nowdays from 2.2, but,
the reason isn't because 3.0 is less good, it's just less available.

Subject: Z280 Macro's

  I am stilling looking for a Z280 assembler. (I talked to Zedux, and theirs
is supposed to ready soon. I think Echelon is also working on one) I have
been using macro's to use my present Z80 assembler (M80/Z80ASM). I
discovered a very nice set of Z280 macro's on Znode central written by
Daniel A. Jacobs. They should work with most popular Z80 macro assemblers.
Keith Petersen has put the Z280-ASM.LBR file on Simtel.

Filename            Type     Bytes     CRC

Directory PD1:<CPM.Z280>
Z280-ASM.LBR.1            BINARY     19072  296BH

  Jacobs also provides this extra bit of information about the Z280
instruction set:

;       244      8080     instructions      total

;       694      Z80      instructions      total

;       1510     Z280     instructions      total

  Here is the -READ.ME file from the Library:
===========================================================================

Here are a couple of files to aid in the writing of Z280
assembly language programs using a macro assembler:

The Z280-EQU.LIB file is all of the EQU's for the internal
configuration registers.

The Z280.LIB file is all of the extended instructions
(in macro form) over and above the Z80 instructions.
(816 new instructions which is way more than double the Z80)

The Instructions have a standard for all code labels, which
doesn't conflict with any already existing Z80 code.
These of course all fit within 8 characters. There are
however some unavoidable exceptions (MULT = MLT).
If you study some of these labels, I think you will soon
see what I have done and should be able to decipher the rest
using the Z280 manual from Zilog.
I've checked everything 3 times, but I'm only human.
Therefore if there are any bugs! PPPPPlease let me know.

P.S.    There are 3 known bugs in the Z280.

(1)     The well known Cache bug which is fixed and Zilog said,
        "they will be shipping next month". (when ever that is)

(2)     The DMA's destination addresses are not incremented
        properly when running at 20 mhz external clock speed.
        Zilog said, "To run the device at 16 mhz to eliminate
        this problem". I have done this, but still experience
        the occasional problem.

(3)     The DMA linking also malfunctions. I don't know if this
        is clock related or not. (Haven't played with it much
        because of the other DMA bug).

Zilog says they have know idea when the DMA problems will be fixed.
As far as a 50 mhz version goes. Zilog says they will probably make
one but first they will make a 30 mhz and before that fix some bugs.
So it will be some years yet, I should think.

Subject: MexPlus funny

Yet another question:

I am currently using MEXPLUS, v1.65B.  All in all, it's a nice program,
except for one idiosyncracy.  When in terminal mode, certain characters
coming from the modem cause the program to go and try to access the disk.
This causes dropped characters, and some confusion on my end.

My question:  Why is MEXPLUS going to the disk at all?  There aren't any
commands that a remote can send to make this happen, are there?  At first,
I thought that maybe MEXPLUS was responding to a request for some kind of
Kermit exchange, but the manual makes no mention of any ability to sense an
impending transfer.

Help!  NightOwl's BBS seems to be down, and I don't have a current phone
number for them.

Thanks.

Subject: VT52/100 Emulation

Tony Waters asked about VT52/100 emulation for CP/M computers.  One way to do
this is to get the commercial version of MEX (MEX-Plus) with the emulation
package.  The trouble is I am not completely sure what features have to be
supported in the host terminal to make the emulation work.  Certain cursor
addressing, screen clearing, and line clearing are needed.  I believe that
insert-line and delete-line are also needed, and I cannot remember whether
or not the Kaypro supports those features.  My guess is that it does.  The
cost is about $90, but you get all the other good things that MEX offers in
the process.

Subject: 8048, 8049, 8051 cross-assemblers

Hi,

Are there cross assemblers for the Intel 80xx series of microcontrollers
available for CPM and/or MS-DOS?  Preferably, they would be public domain.
I would also like recommendations and comments on these same x-assemblers,
or on these microcontrollers.  Please Email me, and I will summarize to the 
group if there is interest.

Thanks,

Subject: H/Z 67 HARD DRIVE PROBLEM

 I have heard that the 8in interface is fairly close to
the st506 interface. On the other hand, I use a DTC510
controller with a ST506 type drive of my choice off
the internal H67 interface card.

Regarding MEXPlus' habit of certain characters causing disk activity, 
(Mark Wilson, 28 Mar 88), I suspect that you may have STAT CIS ON.  I have
noticed the same thing.

Proud owner of two slightly used terminals: a Soroc IQ 140 and a Perkin-Elmer 550B.
No manuals, though. Any other users out there that can tell me how to use the
dip switches to set up the terminals, and for Soroc IQ 140 owners/users,
how on earth does one generate the (missing) ESCape character from the
keyboard? 

Also, for the Perkin-Elmer, can someone enlighten me as to what the
screen control codes are? Ditto for the Soroc. 

Thanks bunches.

Subject: Z-system and the Epson PX-8
Last year when I bought my ZCPR3 and ZCOM for my desktop micro I tried it
out on my PX8 as an interesting exercise - it crashed the system. I have
decided that this is probably due to the VBIOS which only provides the usual
BIOS jump table and the PX-8 has an extended set of BIOS functions. With
only a 128K RAM disk it did not really matter, so I terminated the experiment
after deciding that I could always patch the VBIOS and move one of the other
segments if it was actually needed. My curiosity has been re-awakened by a
TCAP file which includes one for the PX-8. So the question is this - did
others patch the VBIOS? Have I mistakenly diagnosed the problem? I don't
think you can do a manual install on the PX-8 as the CP/M is held in a ROM -
or did some clever person do a manual install and blow a new ROM? Does anyone
out there know? Thanks in anticipation.
