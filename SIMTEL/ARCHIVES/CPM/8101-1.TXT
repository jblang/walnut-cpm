Update on the CPM user's group stuff on the ARPANET:

I did take up Dave Mitton's offer of the tape of the 42 CPMUG disk
images.  After getting around some crocks in RT11's tape formatting,
I got all the stuff off onto disk. There are some problems
yet, though, due to both the fact that its all too big to keep
on disk, as predicted, and the 7-bit ASCII vs 8-bit micro file
problem. They are all stored as 8-bit files on disk here, which
means you can't just TYPE them or LIST them.  I'm leaning toward
writing a program which will 7-bit-ize all files which don't have
any bytes over 177, and flag the others in the file name.  Any
other inspirations are welcome. 

I have archived all the files, but kept the directories on line,
if you are interested. [BBNG]<CLEMENTS.CPMUG>DIRECTORY.V01 thru .V42
are the directory listings.  The files are named V01-FOO.BAR for
a file FOO.BAR from volume 1.
Exception: Files with "/" in the file name have had the "/" changed
to a "-" due to my not wanting to have to quote the "/" for TOPS-20,
which would be hard thru FTP.

You can use ANONYMOUS login, but it get's a very very small CPU
allocation, so do it when things are quiet, if you want to. That's
a policy I can't change either, so I still think we need a
different site for the librarian.  But the files are available now
if anyone volunteers.

	There is a well run, remote cp/m system in Simi valley, Ca.  On
it, there are two floppies and for hard disk platters.  It has all of the
cpmug software and all of the sig/m software.  The system is calles CP/M-Net. 
It is running MP/M.  It has a host (pardon the pun) of games (in basic) on the
fourth hard disk platter (D:) and a nice CBBS.  Give it a try.
The number is (805) 527-9321.   Have fun.

CPM;DOWN LOAD change: When you invoke it, it will print out
"Type CR when ready" and wait for you to type a carriage
return, so you can turn on recording on your local machine.
After receiving the CR it starts the down loading.  The CR is

Subject: Microsoft CPM

Hi,
     Of late, I've been doing quite a bit of work on Microsoft's version
of CP/m for the Apple ][.  I've found that just about anything written for
Vers. 2.X CP/m will run on it.  However, I've also found that just about any- 
thing that is Device-Dependent (i.e. MODEM, DCHBYE57, etc.) usually needs heavy
modification to run on the Apple.  This is mainly because of the Apple's
use of Memory-Mapped I/O and Apple's specs for folks that OEM peripherals 
for the Apple ][.  I've just finished modifying  MODEM and DCHBYE57 to run
on the Apple ][ and anyone that would like a copy is welcome to one.
     I am somewhat reluctant to upload it to a machine here simply because
they are both fairly large programs and I'm not yet sure how much demand 
there is (or will be) for them here.  I will shortly be putting up a 'BBS
under CP/m on the Apple using DCHBYE57 and the RBBS s'ware that is in the
Public-Domain.  Anyone that would like further info on the above or copies of 
the Apple versions of the above should contact me so I can decide if there
is ample demand to warrant uploading them here.

Subject: CP/M RST Survey

As part of the process of carrying my software over to standard CP/M, I
am trying to determine which, if any, of the RST instructions are available
to programs that want to run on all CP/M machines.  If there is any reason
(including use of interrupt) why a program that uses any RST instruction (>0)
would not run on your CP/M system, or any other CP/M system that you are
aware of, please reply with the RST instruction number(s) and their
use(s), the hardware manufacturer or system type, and whether your CP/M is
manufacturer's standard or modified (as regards the use of RST).

Reply to me only; I will tabulate and report results to the list.  Thanks.

Subject: TPM and RST's

  Wqlt,
  I qm running TPM, a CP/M variant produced by Computer Design Labs of
Trenton NJ.  It is CP/M 1.4 compatible, but not 2.x compatible.  TPM
uses RST 0 area for boot, like CPM.  It also uses RST 6 and 7 for system
software.  I believe that CP/M also uses at least one of these RST's,
for DDT's run-time breakpoint.  The TPM manual states explicitely that 
RST's 1 thru 5 are available to the user.
  If you ever complete a list of what publicly available software uses
which RST's, please publish it...
  Good luck.

One problem, of course, is that many people who have set up interrupt
driven terminal, printer, or modem I/O, or who use a realtime clock,
may well have used up all the "free" interrupts just for BIOS

NOTES:
1. Several program exchange systems, though often found on
     lists of CBBS's, have become extinct in recent months:
         / Provo, Utah  (801-375-7000)
         / St. Johnsbury, Vermont  (802-748-9089)
2. Whether a program exchange system is accessible by an alter-
     native long-distance service should be considered when
     planning to modem over long programs.  Charges on SPRINT,
     ITT/CITYCALL and MCI are 50-60% of Ma Bell's regular
     long-distance rates.  Baud rate should also be considered
     when using a RCPM system regularly--see note 11 below.
3. Call-back systems are those where a computer and real
     people share the same telephone line.  To contact the
     people, just dial & let the phone ring until you get an
     answer.  To contact the computer:  (1) dial, (2) let
     the phone ring once, (3) hang up just before the 2nd
     ring, & (4) re-dial.
4. The systems listed here only carry programs that will
     run under the CP/M operating system, most of them
     public domain software distributed by CPMUG or SIG/M,
     the two main CP/M users' groups.  Some of the programs
     involved (especially those in BASIC and PASCAL but also
     a few in Z-80 or 8080 assembly language) can be conver-
     ted to run on other machines quite easily.  But systems
     dedicated to downloading programs for the PET, APPLE,
     TRS-80 and NORTHSTAR do exist.  Ask experienced users
     in your area, or check through "other systems" listings
     on local CBBS's, ABBS's, FORUM-80's, etc.
5. XMODEM is a modification of Ward Christensen's original
     MODEM program designed to allow the transfer of files
     between the exchange system and yours.  The exchange
     system needs the program, not you; you will probably
     be using one of the many versions of MODEM itself:
     e.g., MODEM2, MODEM527, MODEM926, MODEM7, MBOOT, etc.
6. Non-XMODEM remote CP/M systems are starting to appear: for
     instance, Ben Miller's Columbus (OH) CBBS, which uses
     the file transmit & receive functions of "MODEM5", an 
     early version of Mark Zeiger's major enhancement of the
     Christensen program.  At (614) 268-2227 the Columbus
     system is not only a full-fledged CBBS but allows the
     user to enter CP/M in order to take or leave files.
     LICA's BBS on Long Island [at (516) 561-6590; 24 hrs.;
     110-600+ baud] also has a few downloadable ASCII files
     but at present (01/8l) these must be captured like CBBS
     messages and then saved to disk, without any error-
     checking protocol.
7. Some XMODEM systems also operate as real CBBS's, including
     the ones operated by Dick Mead and Rod Hart.  Others,
     like Keith Petersen's & Tom C.'s use a skeleton message-
     handling subprogram called "MINICBBS".  Their emphasis is
     on exchanging software, not messages.
8. A few CBBSs have software exchange functions that require
     the use of a password.  Such systems are not listed here.
9. At present (01/81) the system with the largest disk capacity
     and the most programs up at once is Kelly Smith's running
     a 9+ Mb hard disk.  Dave Hardy's, with 3 Morrow-controlled
     drives giving 3+ Mb is in 2nd place.  Rick Martinek & sev-
     eral other sysops have plans to go over to hard disk quite
     soon.
10. No RCPM (or straight CBBS) system is currently running MP/M
     or another multi-tasking OS in combination with more than
     one modem & telephone line.  After the hard disks, this is
     expected to be the next important development in non-
     profit computer communications.
11. The fastest system is Tim Nicholas's, with a Racal-Vadic
     modem capable of 1200 baud, full duplex. The systems using
     PMMIs can in theory sometimes reach 710 baud but are in
     practice limited to 600 baud except under ideal condi-
     tions.  Systems with D.C.Hayes & other brands of modem do
     not send faster than 300 baud.

Subject: Some more files

The Remote CP/M list just sent by Keith Petersen (W8SDZ) is now also
on MC:CPM;RCP/M NOS just in case you wish to delete that message and
FTP it later.  That file will be kept up-to-date periodically with the
latest information available.

Also, courtesy of Keith, Volume 1, No. 1 issue of the CP/M-Net
Newsletter (stripped of the trailing advertising) is now in
MC:CPM;CPMNET JAN81.  It contains a detailed description of the MODEM2
protocol (in English), a very interesting section on 8080/Z80 coding
tricks and techniques, and a CP/M Tip-of-the-Month on using DDT and
SID to examine a file on a disk other than the current default drive.

MC:CPM;BBSNOS BYAREA and MC:CPM;BBSNOS BYNAME now exist.  The first is
the second sorted by area code and phone number and both will be
periodically updated as needed.

There are, or shortly will be, some new files in MC:CPM; with
announcements forthcoming as soon as I figure out where I left off.

Other developments: Gail Zacharias (GZ@MC) has made some more
improvements to MC:CPM;UP LOAD and MC:CPM;DOWN LOAD.  See
MC:CPM;UPDOWN DOC for how to use those MacLisp programs.  Sometime
soon, TWENEX MacLisp will have enhancements so that you can import and
run those programs for up and downloading ASCII text files cleanly.

Gail is also working on a MacLisp version of MODEM2 which will handle
that protocol and store text files as text files and 8-bit files will
be stored in a special format files which will have two parts: a
documentation preamble section and a binary section.  Files uploaded
in HEX format will be automatically converted and stored in this
format to conserve disk space.  Files currently in HEX format on
MC:CPM; will also be converted to this format.  Of course, you can
still use the text option to prevent conversion and upload HEX files
or download HEX files using the MODEM2 protocol.

Another MacLisp program from Gail is CRCK, which operates in a similar
fashion to the micro version.  You can use this program to compute the
CRC of a file and compare it to the copy you up or downloaded.  This
program has an option to assume either ^Z or 0 padding for the last
sector since that padding is usually not stored in the files on MC.

Finally, in response to CLEMENTS@BBNA collection of 8-bit CPMUG files,
Elliot Moss (EBM@XX) has written a C program (MC:MT;DOWNLOD >, invoked
as :MT;DOWNLOD) to read these files and either display the file for
downloading in a similar fashion to MC:CPM;DOWN LOAD or to create a
7-bit file of those which were originally text files.

It is possible to also have a C version of MODEM2 for ITS/TWENEX use.
Comments from those wishing this utility are solicited.  (Ideally, I
suppose, such a program should be written in MIDAS for portability...)

        MC:CPM;FILTER ASM
        MC:CPM;FILTER HEX

    This program copies any ASCII file and filters out (ignores)
    all control characters except CR, LF, and TAB.  It also sets
    the high order bit of all characters to zero so that files
    created with WordStar or other text processing programs can
    be read by MBASIC.  The filtered copy of the of the file is
    created as 'FILTER.FIL' on the default drive.  The source
    file is left intact.  If the original file's EOF (1AH) is
    not at the physical end of the last sector, this program
    will pad the last sector with EOF's.  This is useful for
    'cleaning up' a file which was originally created by MBASIC
    or text editors which do not pad the last sector with EOF's.

    Command - FILTER [drive]<filename.filetype>

        MC:CPM;D DOC
        MC:CPM;D ASM
        MC:CPM;D HEX

    D.COM is a directory list program, which writes
    5 entries on a line, separated by commas.

    The command contains an internal table of file
    names, which are not to be shown when just "D" is typed.
    (NOTE typing "D *.*" always shows all files)

    Why is this useful:  A typical CP/M disk contains many
    utility files: ed.com, asm.com, submit.com, etc.  When
    you do a directory listing, you typically aren't interested
    in seeing all those files, but rather just the "current"
    or "active" files.  This is what "D.COM" can do.

    similar  and equivalent to software that is available in the
