I'm looking at laptops, and am curious about the NEC 8401.  I'd be
interested in hearing anything about this machine.  I also have 
several specific questions:

  1)  Is there an xmodem protocol file transfer program available for it?
  2)  Will CP/M save/load programs from cassette?  Is the cassette device a
      standard recorder, or is it necessary to buy one from NEC?
  3)  Is all of the ROM software accessible without any chip swapping (Portable
      WordStar, Calc, Filer, Telcom.)
  4)  If there IS an xmodem program available, how in the world do you 
      bootstrap it in for the first time, given that there's no built-in 
      programming language?  Is there a user's group that distributes things
      on cassette?

As a dedicated CP/M user, this machine has a lot of appeal, but there are
no dealers in the state of NC (according to NEC) so information is hard to
come by.

Thank you,
Ross Alford

   I am trying to locate a BYE program with the DUAL$IO equate still in

exactly as "DUAL$IO".  I need to implement BYE on a Xerox 16/8 system;
it will run both procesessors as long as there is nothing being sent to
the screen on the Z-80.  If I can enable DIAL$IO, I can run BYE and use
the system's CP/M-86 side at the same time.  I would appreciate it if
someone could point me to a BYE program that still has this equate.

Fellow DR-cursers....

	I've just got my grubby mits on DR Draw (quite nice) and have a problem:
I can't find any info. on writing a device driver for GSX.  I've got this non-
standard plotter y'see (Silver Reed EB50) and I'd like to use it 'cos it's got
4 colo(u)rs and the definition is nice and high, but all the manuals I can find
just say something helpful like, "GSX is great" and, "GSX is truly the best
thing since sliced silicon", and...well, you get the picture.

	Can any clever bods out there help a poor, lost soul such as myself?

	Ta. in advance.

Does anyone have a public domain APL interpreter  for CP/M.
I have heard of Micro APL but it is rumored to be expensive.
If no one has APL for CPM perhaps the is a public domain APL
written in C that I could translate for my poor CP/M system!

What you're looking for is DR's GSX Programmer's Guide.  I purchased
mine directly from them several years ago;  I assume it's still possible
to do so.

The manual contains all the information that you'll need on data structures
and formats, and is surprisingly clear.

        I had similar problems with ZCPR3 on my Gemini (British)
system.

        In my case neither LDR or ALIAS would work until the whole
Z-system was running. I wrote a small 'C' program to substitute for
LDR. Then I found the answer.

        Which was to reassemble ALIAS and LDR from scratch. Not only
the SYSENV.LIB file but also all those others like Z3HDR.LIB and
CBIOSHDR.LIB get included. Having done this everything was fine.

        It seems that for everything that runs BEFORE the environment
is installed, using Z3INS is not enough.

        BTW, I had a small but annoying problem when linking ALIAS and
LDR. The libraries that come with the distribution disks (I got mine
from the New Jersey group via the British CPMUG) were assembled with a
version of M80 that only puts the first 6 characters of names in the
.REL file, while my copy of M80 exports 8 characters. This caused some
names not to match at link time. I worked round this by fixing the
sources of ALIAS and LDR. If I wanted to reassemble a lot of utilities
I'd rebuild the libraries.

        Now for a question. Does your PATH work correctly? At boot time
one of the programs in my STARTUP script downloads various utilities to
my RAMDISK. However I haven't been able to get the path searching to go
for this disk before the currently logged-in disk.  This is nullifying
the use of the RAMDISK, which I went for as an alternative to a number
of RCPs.

        Any help anyone could offer would be much appreciated.

Does any one know of a vi like editor for CP/M.  I'm tired of having to
switch back and forth from vi at work to wordstar at home.  I have express
but it's not quite the same.

I know there is vi for the IBM-PC, which probably means the powers that 
be will totally ignore millions of CP/M users again.

Thanks in advance for any pointers in the right direction.

     I am looking for a Kermit-80 (CP/M-80) overlay or patch that will
work on the Microsoft Premium Softcard IIe. The standard Apple CP/M
version of Kermit does not work with this card, since it was written
for the original Softcard which accesses I/O through the memory-
mapped locations in the Apple's memory. The Premium Softcard IIe
card contains its own memory and performs I/O through the 6502 micro-
processor using a 6502 BIOS program.

     Unfortunately, I am not fluent in 8080 assembly language, nor
do I have a "Premium Softcard IIe System Programmers Manual" that I 
could reference to construct a patch. Has anyone out there made this 
patch or know where I could find one? I am running CP/M Version 2.25
and have a Super Serial Card in Slot 2.

     This may be a common problem. I assume this problem also occurs
with the new Softcard II, since it also contains its own memory
onboard. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

			Thank you in advance

Anyone know how to tell if a dot-matrix print head needs replacement?
I've has an Epson FX-80 head for about 6 M characters, and the print
quality is going down (tops of letters like "h" and "l" are not coming
out).  Am I due for a change?  What's a good price on print heads?


thanks.

Before you buy a replacement---try opening the print head from the back
and putting a very small drop of fine grade machine oil (like sewing
machine oil) on the rear of the pins.  Then "exercise" the missing pins by
printing lots of hhhhhh's and lllll's.  This worked for us a year ago when
we lost the descender pins on our Epson Fx-80 and we have had no further
trouble.  The oil will cost about $2-3 dollars for a full bottle,
(available at the local drug store) and a print head will run between
$80-100.

Before you throw away your print head, try wiping the pins with alcohol.
This will remove any ink residue (picked up from the ribbon) that might
be jamming some of the pins. This has worked very well for me in the
past on my NEC 8023. Another thing to check is the little tin ribbon
guide, which is also a "mask"; if it is slightly out of line it will
block either the upper or lower pins, producing incomplete characters.

Good luck!

	    I had similar problems with ZCPR3 on my Gemini (British)
    system.
    
	    In my case neither LDR or ALIAS would work until the whole
    Z-system was running. I wrote a small 'C' program to substitute for
    LDR. Then I found the answer.
    
	    Which was to reassemble ALIAS and LDR from scratch. Not only
    the SYSENV.LIB file but also all those others like Z3HDR.LIB and
    CBIOSHDR.LIB get included. Having done this everything was fine.
    
	    It seems that for everything that runs BEFORE the environment
    is installed, using Z3INS is not enough.
    
	    BTW, I had a small but annoying problem when linking ALIAS and
    LDR. The libraries that come with the distribution disks (I got mine
    from the New Jersey group via the British CPMUG) were assembled with a
    version of M80 that only puts the first 6 characters of names in the
    .REL file, while my copy of M80 exports 8 characters. This caused some
    names not to match at link time. I worked round this by fixing the
    sources of ALIAS and LDR. If I wanted to reassemble a lot of utilities
    I'd rebuild the libraries.
    
	    Now for a question. Does your PATH work correctly? At boot time
    one of the programs in my STARTUP script downloads various utilities to
    my RAMDISK. However I haven't been able to get the path searching to go
    for this disk before the currently logged-in disk.  This is nullifying
    the use of the RAMDISK, which I went for as an alternative to a number
    of RCPs.
    
	    Any help anyone could offer would be much appreciated.

Peter,

Yes, my PATH does work properly.  However, I set the path using
PATH.COM, and noit as part of the BIOS initialization.  PATH.COM
is called by the STARTUP alias and is used with my RAM disk.  It
works fine.  In fact, one of the reasons I wanted to get ZCPR3 up
was to avoid losing the >SUB file tail on the default when the
RAM disk was activated.

BTW, did you notice my later note on the fix for getting STARTUP
to run correctly?  You must put the address of Z3CL into
Z3ENV+18H at initialization time.  When you do that, it all works
fine.

I am posting this to the net because email couldn't deliver.

two vital sources of information:

	Micro Cornucpia (magazine)
	The Micro Technical Journal
	po box 223
	bend, or 97709

	Morrow Owners Review (magazine)
	POBox 5487

And...

	Civil Computing Corporation (advertizes in MOR)
	2111 Research Drive, Suite 1
	Livermore, CA 94550
	(415)-455-8086

	sells MD2 - MD3 upgrade for $350 including installation,
	does not include shipping or tax on parts.

MOR also sells PD software disks cheap, and so does Micro-C.

I have an md11 and an md2, my dad has an md3. unfortunately,
the md2 and md3 are about 1000 miles apart, so I cant do a
visual for you.

I understand there are some changes needed to ZCPR to make it work.

I currently have a BIOS for CPM 3 that I am currently debugging a driver
for the CCS 2422, I am using a Cromemco SCC for the CPU but drivers will
be available for the CCS 2810, Its just matter of supporting the UART.

If you are interrested in abtaing this BIOS from me send me EMAIL.
I am not currently ready to make it public domain (lack of documentation)
but if your still interrested contact me. The BIOS is designed to be
modular with seperate drivers for the various supportted boards. Currently
I have drivers for the Cromemco SCC, Cromemco TUART, Xebec S1410 hard disk
controller, Xebec SASI interface board for the S100 bus, NCR 5380 SCSI
controller chip.

Subject: dBase II/ZIP Initialization
Message-Id: <10Mar86.092139.PB80@A.CS.CMU.EDU>

I've changed my terminal, and now have a slight problem with the terminal
drivers in my dBase II and ZIP software. Both came with an installation
COM file, but the files are now irrevocably trashed. Sigh. Fortunately the
dUTIL and QuickCode install files are OK.

My problem is minimal; the screen clear function needs to be redefined.
Everything else is OK (thank goodness). Although I can hack around this
in dBase by outputing 25 blank lines (how crass), I'm stuck with background
garbage in ZIP.

My dBase II is Ver. 2.4 and I think the INSTALL.COM file was ver. 2.9, but
I'm not sure. ZIP version is unknown, but it is of the same vintage. It's
install file is called ZIPIN.COM.

Can anyone identify the appropriate patch point for these two packages, or
does anyone actually have the appropriate installation files?

Thanks. They're still usable without re-installation, but what a pain!

I have only been registered with this message system for a couple days now
but it seems that there is a lot of information available.

I have a couple questions;
1) Has anybody used CP/M on the Commodore 128?  and if so, is the CP/M rather
   standard or are there annoying idiosyncrasies?
   I am new to the C128 as well, only having my system for about 2 weeks which
   brings me to the next question....

2) Is there a distribution list similar to say ATARI8 or ATARI16 for the c
   C128?  If so, how can i get on it?

I have to second Tom Reid's answer about Pascals - Turbo is the best
available and is cheap besides.  If you run a IBM-clone it is very
cheap - of the order of $29 from mail order houses.

On the other hand, if it's CP/M-80 that you're looking for not CP/M-88
or -86; it a bit more expensive.  I went through a long painfull  process
to buy a CP/M-80 version at a reasonable price - best I could do was
$59 from Programmers Shop.  (Good place to deal with - most places don't
know what CP/M is - one dodo even asked if it was IBM-compatible!)

Alternately, dealling directly with Borland is not too bad either - if
I were to do it all again I would probably deal direct and hange the hassle.
BTW, it really is as good as all the reviews say.  I'm not a pro programmer,
had to buy it for a college course I'm taking as I couldn't get to
the supplied computer...

(I hesitate to say this, but there *is* a P.D. Pascal compiler in the
simtel20 archives SIG/M vol something-or-the-other.  It is JRT Pascal and
I've been told it's not worth the 'cost' of downloading.  I haven't tried
it, and know of no one that likes or uses it.)

Hi:

Why use "free" Pascal?  Turbo Pascal is:

1       cheap.
2       reasonably well documented and supported by Borland.
3       very well Known by all and sundry.
4       fast and compact.

	If Turbo Pascal doesn't suit you, there is always 'NEVADA' Pascal by
Ellis Computing; however, this Pascal is somewhat simplistic and requires a
separate editor to create source code - where Turbo Pascal provides a nice
little full screen editor.  Ellis technical support ranges from nill to worse
than none; all in all I don't recommend them.  Turbo Pascal can be optained
with tutorial documentation and disks for under $100.00.

Why go with the obscure and generic when you can have a 'standard' without
mortgaging your life away?

I am a relatively new member of this net and am trying to obtain a copy of 
wordstar for my Commodore 128.  It comes with CPM 3.0.  I have called DS
and they informed me that the most current version they had of wordstar was
under CPM 2.2 on an 8" disk. Questions follow:

1.  Can CPM 3.0 operate, with full compatability, CPM 2.2 software? (Given that
    it is on a 5 1/4" format)

2.  Where can I get wordstar for CPM?

I am getting ready to attend a military school in June and a good word processor
is necessary.  No flames please since my wife is to attend the school also and
she is already familiar with wordstar.  (I was given an ultimatum either I get
wordstar or I do all the word processing for the both of us!)

Thanks in advvance.

My bet is that almost anything working under cp/m 2.2 will work under 3.0.
Otherwise, no one would buy 3.0.  The best place to find a legal copy would
be to look in magazines that cater to the 128 and find a mail order house
that has ported the favorites over.

You might try MicroPro to see if they have a 128 version, but they, along
with Digital Research and the rest, have abandoned cp/m 80.  They will
probably still take your money if you force them.

Subject: Uploads for SIMTEL20 - an alternative

If you have some files to submit to the CP/M public domain collection
at SIMTEL20 but you don't have access to a host that can FTP there,
you can upload them to the CP/M area on GEnie at no charge and I'll
see that they are forwarded to SIMTEL20.  GEnie has local nodes in
over 450 cities so there's a good chance of having one in your local
calling area.  It's a new nation-wide service similar to CompuServe.
They have a free upload (turn the clock off) policy (during non-prime
hours) in effect for the next three months.  In addition, I just
learned that they have a special no-charge sign-up deal until March
31st.  There is no monthly minimum and the hourly rate for 300/1200
bps is only $5 during non-prime hours and on weekends/holidays.

You can have a free look around and optional sign-up by doing the
following:

   Dial 1-800-638-8369.  Upon connection, enter HHH
   At the U#= prompt enter ^R5JM11973,GENIE and press return

The ^R is of course a control-R.  That turns on local node echo to
give you an interface like you're used to.  If you omit the control-R
the node assumes you are doing your own local echo.

This is not to be considered as a solicitation for you to sign up on
GEnie for the purpose of downloading.  It is for informational
purposes only.  They don't stand to profit if you sign up and upload
for free.  The free upload policy finally gives us a way for
non-Internet readers to submit their programs to our collection.

    If you have some files to submit to the CP/M public domain collection
    at SIMTEL20 but you don't have access to a host that can FTP there,
    you can upload them to the CP/M area on GEnie at no charge and I'll
    see that they are forwarded to SIMTEL20.  GEnie has local nodes in
    over 450 cities so there's a good chance of having one in your local
    calling area.  It's a new nation-wide service similar to CompuServe.
    They have a free upload (turn the clock off) policy (during non-prime
    hours) in effect for the next three months.  In addition, I just
    learned that they have a special no-charge sign-up deal until March
    31st.  There is no monthly minimum and the hourly rate for 300/1200
    bps is only $5 during non-prime hours and on weekends/holidays.
    
    You can have a free look around and optional sign-up by doing the
    following:
    
       Dial 1-800-638-8369.  Upon connection, enter HHH
       At the U#= prompt enter ^R5JM11973,GENIE and press return
    
    The ^R is of course a control-R.  That turns on local node echo to
    give you an interface like you're used to.  If you omit the control-R
    the node assumes you are doing your own local echo.
    
    This is not to be considered as a solicitation for you to sign up on
    GEnie for the purpose of downloading.  It is for informational
    purposes only.  They don't stand to profit if you sign up and upload
    for free.  The free upload policy finally gives us a way for
    non-Internet readers to submit their programs to our collection.

Thanks for the poop on GEnie.  Now, please -- if I DO have FTP
access, what directory should I use on SIMTEL20 for uploads?  (I
didn't think the general directories were available for writing,
to preserve configuration control).

Version 11.2 of the W0RLI MailBox/Gateway has been released.  The
binaries and documentation are in PAKT112A.LBR and the sources are in
PAKT112B.LBR.  These are now available from SIMTEL20 as:

Filename			Type	 Bytes	 CRC

Directory PD:<CPM.PACKET>
PAKT112A.LBR.1			BINARY	108800  5FC0H
PAKT112B.LBR.1			BINARY	145280  75A4H

The changes since the last such posting, version 10.0, are summarized
below in an extract from the CHANGES.TNC file.

For those who have not seen this system before, a brief description:

The W0RLI MailBox and GateWay is a system which runs on a Xerox 820
computer and which operates on Amateur Packet Radio via one or two
TAPR TNCs (or clones). It also runs with TNC-2s (W3IWI is running one).

The W0RLI system is running at over 75 sites in some number of
countries and makes up the majority of the packet mail forwarding
system. It is also used for gatewaying between local packet areas and
long haul links on HF, or to nearby nets on other VHF/UHF bands.
For a more complete description, see NOTES.TNC.


Hank is not on ARPANET or Usenet.  I will be glad to relay comments
and questions to him.  If you want the distribution on disk, send
a self-addressed stamped 8" SSSD disk (in re-usable mailer) to Hank at
his callbook address. Two disks if you want the sources as well.
To reduce the load on Hank, I will do the same under the same conditions.
I am also good in the Callbook.

I need to know about compatibility between dBASEII CP/M
and dBASEII IBM-PC/MS-DOS

A friend wants to computerize his small business.  I want to help
him.  I have CP/M and do not want to change to MS-DOS for myself,
but he needs to go to MS-DOS instead of
trying to use CP/M.

My question: Is there any compatibility problem between dBASEII
versiuons on the two operating systems?  I plan to develop his
system using CP/M, and then transfer the files (CMD and DBF, etc)
to his MS-DOS system either by modem or by disk.  But before
we comitt to that approach, I need to know about any Gotchas that may lurk in
the background.

I know that there is incompatibility between dBASEII and dBASEIII, but that's
not the issue we're considering.  We need to know if there are problems between dBASEII across the CP/M and MS-DOS boundary.

Please respond direct to STORK@MIT-MC, for I do not read infor-IBMPC.  Will
summarize and submit to nets if there is interest.

Thnaks,  Eric

From my breif experience with CPM 3.0 (I did a little testing of it for 
Xerox a few years ago)  I discovered that everything I was using under  
version 2.2 worked well under version 3.0.   The disk format should make
no difference in how the system is run except for the amount of storage
that is available on a disk (the previous is not quite true, but it is
good enough as far as the normal user is concerned,  No flames, further
questions about the difference are accepted).

In regards to WS.  I would suggest that you try your freindly neighborhood
computer store, or mail order computer store.  WS should be available in 
almost every format of CP/m by now.  You may have to do some installation
of it to get the terminal drivers right on your computer.  If you can't
find a 5.25" version, there are many places that will transfer between
media for a small sum of money.  You may also try to find a person
who has both 8 and 2.25" drives and can write on the 5.25" disk in a
format that your computer can read.  All 8" single sided, single density
CP/m disks are interchangable, but not all 5.25" disks, or even other formats
of 8" disks.  I may be talked into doing the conversion for you if
it is necessary, but I make no time guarantees.  I have access to a Xerox
820-II and a Xerox 16/8PC with both 8" and 5.25" drives, but I have to
be home to use it, and being at college for a good part of
the year limits my use of it.

If you have any other questions, please send me e-mail.

   Unfortunately, this is not correct.  Any *PROPERLY* written software that
runs under CP/M 2.2 will probably operate under 3.0.  Software which breaks
the rules of good CP/M programming practice and make direct BIOS calls, 
however, will probably not work (though some will with the use of a PD
RSX available through the user's group network).  Also, many programs that
manipulate the disk directories may fail, as DRI modified some of the directory
manipulation structures, and also the banking creates a situation where some
of the information on disks & directories which CP/M 2.2 expects to find in
RAM is actuall in a switched-out bank.  Thus, programs that use this information
have to understand about CP/M 3 bank switching.

   Personally, I despise CP/M 2.2, and find CP/M 3.0 marginally acceptable.
As it came with a system purchased for me by an employer to increase my
productivity, I have it.  I probably would not have purchased it myself.

People, do any of you out there in net.land know anything about Sanyo's machine
called the MBC1000?  It's a single-unit, single-floppy-drive CP/M-based system
which I believe they don't make no more.  In particular, I'd like to either
get a decent spreadsheet program for it or make the CALC*STAR which was given
me with it work.  (I was given the program but not the Install program, and it's
installed for the *wrong machine* -- teach me to buy a used computer...)

Any information would be appreciated.

The users file size is set at install time and does not grow for the
life of the system.  The user file is indexed using a simple hash
algolrythm based on the users last name.  This allows very rapid user
look-up at signon and for message entry.  On a system allowing 300
users the users file stays at 30k... the messages file will grow
dynamically as messages are entered, however, since the messages are
stored in a packed format, this file will grow much slower than the
same file would in RBBS. All menus, bulletins, welcome, and news files
are standard ASCII text files, created with any good editor.

PBBS provides the following features:

	Extensive 8 level user profile
	Totally menu driven single character commands
	Up to 25 NEWS files
	A WELCOME message
	A BULLETIN message
	Built-in WHATSNEW and WHATSFOR display
	CHAT with settable access times
	FEEDBACK to sysop
	Public and Private Message system
	Automatic mail waiting lookup at login
	Highest message read counter
	User lookup based on last name
	List of last 20 logins with date and time
	Automatic User/Message file maintenance
	Optional CP/M access restriction
	Optional CP/M knowledge question
	Automatic file run on entry to CP/M
	BYE33X and BYE504 bdos interface
	Automatic support file creation

The .com files themselves total 46k on a system with a 1k allocation
block size and 50k on a system with a 2k block size.

PBBS is self-maintaining in the sense that the users and messages file
are 'mapped' such that on the first "loss-of-carrier" call after
midnight each day, PBBS automatically scans the USER file and deletes
users that have been inactive for a for a period of time defined by
their access level.  PBBS then scans the message base and deletes all
messages to these deleted users. After the first loss-of-carrier after
midnight each day PBBS runs a short update of files such that any old
users and messages are deleted.  This function is done off-line, that
is, it will only occur on the first "loss-of carrier" after
midnight, and disables the modem during the time of update. Thus the
user is not burdened with waiting for the system to do it's
maintenance. After completion, PBBS returns to a wait for next call
state. The space created is then available as mentioned above.  The
number of days since the last signon is used as the determining factor
in the daily update of the users file... this number of days is
determined from a table of attributes attached to each of 8 active
user levels (level 0 is used to indicate a deleted user, level 1
indicates a banned user).  Banned users and any users with a
'days-to-deletion' value of 0 are not deleted from the database during
the update routine.  The exact day values and other related security
information for each access level are stored in a table that you set
up using the PBBSHDR file.  Level 9 is reserved for the sysop.  This
system is ideal for use with a modified version of LOCK that checks a
byte in high memory for a match to a preset value imbedded in the
'locked' .com file. PBBS allows such a byte-location in high memory to
be specified and then places the access level of the current user into
that byte.  When a .com file is run that has a value of 9 imbedded in
it by PROT then the file is for all intents and purposes non-existant
if the current user is not the sysop, with an access level of 9. An
ascii equivalent of the access level can also stored in high memory
for the sake of compatability with any existing RBBS files that may
need it.

The MESSAGES update deletes any old messages that are to a user that
just got deleted.  The public messages must be deleted manually by the
sysop while in the PBBSMNT routine. The access level of a user is set
to 2 initially but it is auto-incremented on the next call on a new
date up to a level of 5.....  for access greater than 5 the sysop must
manually upgrade the user by using the PBBSMNT file. The auto-bump of
the access level only occurs if the call is NOT on the same day as the
previous call.  PBBSMNT stores the date and time of a user file or
messages file acces in the index file and tells you what the last
date/time of the last update was.

PBBS implements the BYE33X and BYE504 bdos interface, and as such, is
almost totally hardware independant.  If you can install BYE33X or
BYE504 for your system, you can run PBBS with no need for special
inserts or overlays.  The only customization required is performed in
one header file that is automatically included in each of the
operating programs of PBBS at assembly time.  The PBBS maintenance
file uses the same real time clock insert as your BYE program to allow
it's use independant of BYE.

PBBS is also available via modem from the Dallas Connection RCP/M
(214) 238-1016  (300/1200/2400).

I read this group for CP/M information.  I'm an old time CP/M
hacker (first implementation I did was 1.4 on an Altair 8800).
Mostly, however, it seems to be full of (useful) information on
CP/M work/look alikes.  Might I suggest a new group net.micro.ZDOS
for those postings?  Then I wouldn't have to "n" through them, and
the ZCPR3 folks wouldn't have to "n" through the CP/M stuff.  Just
a thought....

Hi,

I just read Keith Peterson's letter about the new PBBS. I'd like
to get a copy of it, but I don't have access to a host directly
connect to the ARPANet, and I can't afford to download it from
Dallas at 300 baud (I live in Massachusetts). So, could anyone
out there who has it or can download it conveniently send me a
copy? I run CP/M 3.0 on a Commodore 128 and 1571 disk drive. The
drive can read Kaypro II, Kaypro IV, Osborne DD, and Epson QX-10
5 1/4" disks. I am willing to send a disk and return postage, but I
can't format disks except in the Commodore format, so I can't send
a formatted disk.
Thanks in advance!!

Subject: NBI to PC-DOS (and CP/M) Connections
Message-Id: <17Mar86.150955.PB80@A.CS.CMU.EDU>

I've received a number of responses to my query last month, and made a
number of phone calls. Here's what I found out:

There are three and two-halves solutions to my problem. As you would
expect, functionality is proportional to cost.

The first solution, and the most cost-effective one, is a piece of software
which NBI had Microsoft write about two years ago. It took a little while
to figure this out, but it's called:

	OASys 4000SC MS-DOS Conversion Utility

This assumes, of course, 5 1/4" disk drives. This package allows you to
read and write such disks (DSDD - 48 tpi) plus it allows some mapping
between WP tokens and ASCII characters. The mapping is limited but does
take care of things like CR/LF, tabs, backspaces and form feeds so that
your ASCII files will be in a readable "generic" form. There is no
"format code/command mapping". It runs on all MS-DOS machines (NBI has
their own clone, the 4100PC), and costs $200. One caveat on the AT is that
you have a problem with the 96 tpi drive since the 4000SC is (typically,
unless you have the "high capacity" drives) equipped with 48 tpi drives.
The solution is to buy a second 48 tpi drive, about $100 additional plus
your effort in installing it (easy). That totals $300 and buys you a
simple, direct file transfer not dependent on physical proximity. For a
CP/M'er use a similar transfer program (Media Master, Uniform, etc.) to
go from CP/M to MS-DOS first. Unfortunately, I couldn't find any software
supporting a direct CP/M to 4000SC route. Sigh.

Solution one and one-half is a NBI card known as the M-400. It costs $700
and buys you a 68B00 (remember the Commodore PET?)-based co-processor running
an early version of WP called "Docu-Writer". It also reads and writes NBI
disks and resides on the PC bus. Although "Docu-Writer" is less powerful
than WP, it offers the same interface as WP so that your word processing
skills transfer easily. It runs in most (all?) PC/PC-XT clones. It DOES
NOT run in the AT/AT-clones due to the higher system clock speed. It appears
likely that it never will as NBI has other plans for AT owners. If you don't
have an AT-type machine and you would like to leverage your WP skills then
this card may be for you since you still get the MS-DOS conversion utility
functionality discussed above.

The other solution one and one-half, is a commercially available box for
disk conversions:

	Keyword Office Technologies, Inc.
	2816 11th Street NE
	Calgary, Alberta, T2E 7S7
	(800) 227-1817 x825A

Two US (West Coast) offices:

	649 Mission at New Montgomery
	San Francisco, CA  94105
	(415) 543-5426
	Contact: Deborah McAfee

	2047 E. Hamilton Ave.
	San Jose, CA  95125
	(408) 371-7770

The list price for the Keyword 7000 is $7996 (US).

Solution number two is based on a serial link between the NBI and the target
machine. This requires the NBI ASYNC/BISYNC Advanced Communications package
which will run you $2500, plus the cost of an external modem and installation.
All told you're touching $3,000. What you get is the ability to do terminal
emulation-like things and serial file transfers. You also get a software
package called TAILORS that lets you do very reasonable (but apparently not
complete) mappings between the file formats on each end. You use your own
word processor on the PC-DOS/MS-DOS or CP/M or what-have-you end and one
of the commercially available communications packages. Of course you may need
either two modems, or proximity in order to run a cable, but you get added
flexibility. Like to take your dBase or 1-2-3 file and ship it over to the
NBI to put into a document? Well, TAILORS is supposed to make that possible.
But it's not cheap.

Solution number three is the Rolls-Royce of systems; the System 64, or OASys.
It'll run you upwards of $15,000 and more depending on configuration. What it
buys you in this context is:

	1) A star-organized LAN with a PC-DOS 8086 central processor, hard
disk, and 6809-based channels.

	2) Transparent file access from any "device" where "device" may be
an NBI machine, or a PC-class machine, including file format conversions.

	3) The ability to run WP through your PC-class machine (actually
on the 6809 <I think>). You can even run WP from home over a dial-up line.

This is only a brief description, but you get the general impression.
Slick, but a rather expensive for my needs.

This investigation has been an education for me. Although I still think
that technically the 4000SC is not impressive for the price (one can go
buy a PC plus a major word processing package for less), what you do
get is hand-holding and a clear upgrade path: a networking solution.
Although I won't pay that much for the hand-holding, many office automation
managers will (and perhaps reasonably so). My problem in initial NBI contacts
was probably due to too much knowledge and too little understanding of the NBI
philosophy/market-place on my part. I've had many contacts with NBI personnel,
and all have been pleasant and helpful, but it was a user of NBI equipment on
this net that actually pointed me to the disk conversion solution.

While I'll probably never buy NBI equipment, if I were responsible for
automating a large word processing environment I'd certainly consider NBI,
especially since they appear to be offering a reasonable LAN solution while
IBM is still (basically) dithering.

So . . . back to the beginning:

Can anyone tell what the actual format of a 4000SC 5 1/4" floppy is so that
I can roll my own CP/M conversion utility?

I am in Princeton (NJ) for a few months and had to leave my (1984) Kaypro IV
back in Holland. 

Questions:
   o    Anyone implemented ZCPR3 for Kaypro (-IV), I have a running ZCPR2, with
	some modified features. Source available on diskette.
	I have a '1984/5' source of ZCPR3 (in Holland), but we seem to be 
	missing new updates?
   o    Anyone knows any hardware and/or software enhancements to implements
	a RAM disk. I am currently working on a 128k-RAM disk, I even have
	a print (as published in the German MC-journal), but don't know
	yet how (or even if) to put it physically in the Kaypro.
	Anyone experience ? Or have commercial prints for Z-80 systems?

'Offers':
    o   ZCPR2 for Kaypro-II & IV
    o   CALCOMP and FXYPLOT (2- & 3-D plots) written in Microsoft Fortran
	for an Epson printer (easily adaptable for graphics addressable
	printers)

As has been previously said, Turbo Pascal is a fantastic & cheap Pascal
for your micro.  I am currently using v3.0 on a Kaypro II (the slow
one) and I find it more than adequate.  The new version is $69, up
from $49, but worth every penny.  They are still supporting their
CP/M users, too.  I would recommend it over every other Pascal avail.
for CP/M machines just for its compile speed, but its superset of
Pascal standard functions/procedures and VERY nice documentation on
v3.0 make it even better.

How to get it?  I wouldn't go to my dealer unless he gives you a price
<$69.  Order it via mail, unless you need it now.  There are order forms
in magazines such as _Byte_ every month, and Borland *knows* what CP/M
is.  (That, by the way, is why I wouldn't go through a dealer.  It is
a common problem that dealers tend to be linear-minded.  It seems to be
IBM or "what?")

There are more good reasons to buy the language from them rather than
get any other compiler, regardless of price:
   * Their version gives such control over the computer, it is like
     having the power of C in a full scale language with reasonably
     complete error checking.
   * Most of the public domain prgs written in Pascal are in Turbo.
   * Turbo v3.0 is almost completely bug-free.  The only bug that I've
     heard rumored is in the overlay mechanism (see _Byte_, a couple
     of months back), and I have never used it, even though some of
     my programs were much too large for the built-in editor.
   * Interfaces quite well with the operating system.  Personally, I
     like having direct control over BIOS/BDOS routines without
     switching to assembler.
   * Upgradable.  I use it on both CPM & MSDOS machines.  It is useful
     to have it work on both -- program source is 100% portable, with
     the exception of machine-specific calls and in-line machine coding.

Sorry to all of you who have read these before from everyone else, but
there seem to be fewer and fewer CP/M users around today.  It is good
to have the best products available supported.

Z-term is the best I have found so far... Southwestern Data Systems

Very similar to Ascii Express the Professional

Somebody mailed out a VT100 emulator on net.sources not 2 weeks ago. He
also offered a *free* copy to anybody who mailed in a disk, mailer and
return postage. This works on an apple with a number of 80-column cards
and a number of serial port cards. I haven't got it, but maybe you should
redirect your request to net.sources.wanted.
This probably doesn't work with the CP/M card, but IF it can save to disk
and IF you can copy APPLE files to CP/M files, you shouldn't have a problem.

The CP/M 3.0 for the Commodore 128 does not support modem (or any other

Hi:

What is Z-Term?  Is it public domain, expensive, etc?  Does it have a good
VT-100 emulation?

Please illuminate the uninformed! (namely me).

    I am in Princeton (NJ) for a few months and had to leave my (1984) Kaypro IV
    back in Holland. 
    
    Questions:
       o    Anyone implemented ZCPR3 for Kaypro (-IV), I have a running ZCPR2, with
	    some modified features. Source available on diskette.
	    I have a '1984/5' source of ZCPR3 (in Holland), but we seem to be 
	    missing new updates?
       o    Anyone knows any hardware and/or software enhancements to implements
	    a RAM disk. I am currently working on a 128k-RAM disk, I even have
	    a print (as published in the German MC-journal), but don't know
	    yet how (or even if) to put it physically in the Kaypro.
	    Anyone experience ? Or have commercial prints for Z-80 systems?
    
    'Offers':
	o   ZCPR2 for Kaypro-II & IV
	o   CALCOMP and FXYPLOT (2- & 3-D plots) written in Microsoft Fortran
	    for an Epson printer (easily adaptable for graphics addressable
	    printers)

I suspect you can find what you need for ZCPR3 on the SIMTEL20 archives.  The major directory is PD:<ZSYS>.

I -- and I am sure many others -- would very much like a copy of your FORTRAN plotting routines.  For some reason, plotting seems not to have been too well developed over here.  

Please mail direct to me if I can help in any way.  I don't have a Kaypro, but I have gotten ZCPR3 up on a Heath H89.

Z-Term is (was) a commercially produced communications package
put out by Southwestern Data Systems in Santee, CA.  It came out
in a couple of forms, the best one being Z-Term Professional.
The software allowed the user to emulate several common terminals
(vt52, datamedia, soroc, adm3a) when communicating with other
computers (directly or through a modem).  The software permitted
you to use different protocols, depending on what was needed, to
transfer files between the Apple and the host computer.  Thus the
Christiansen Protocol for Xmodem (receive and transmit) was also
supported--and served as the heart of Z-Term.  A library of
commonly called numbers could be stored for autodialing (tone or
pulse).  For each number stored, a set of macros could be defined
by the user so that login procedures and passwords could be
automatically issued by the computer to speed up interactions.
There are several other nice features about Z-Term which are
nicely packaged and make it worth the cost over public domain
software such as the Xmodem series.

One caution, the original Z-Term did not work with the PCPI CP/M
card (or the StarCard).  Z-Term has been revised and re-released
by another company, whose name escapes me for the moment, but is
called Ascii Express Professional (CP/M version).  There is also
an Apple DOS version of the same software.  There are so many
features about it that people have become confused about using
it.  However, I still think that it is an excellent product and
outstrips the communication packages I have been using on the IBM
PC--and that is the machine I use most nowadays.

Peter, Echelon is just now releasing bootable disks for the Kaypro
series.  ZCPR3/ZRDOS with no installation requirements at all (just
insert and boot).  There is also an introductory user's guide (non-tech).
The book is extra (I think).  You also have the option of looking up
the sources in ZWORD3.TXT (in PD:<ZSYS.DOC> on SIMTEL20).

Thanks for the kind words about Z-Term (Z-Pro), Mel.  A couple of inaccuracies
though.  Z-Term and Z-Pro are no longer in production.  There was originally
scheduled (a couple of years ago) a CP/M version of ASCII Express, but it was
never brought out.  A marketing decision, basically.  

Right now there are three ASCII Express's, one for Apple DOS 3.3, one for Apple
ProDOS, and ASCII Pro-MS for the IBM PC/XT/AT/Jr. and compatibles world.  The
company now marketing all of those is United Software Industries, 8399 Topanga
Canyon Blvd., Canoga Park, CA  91304.  Business phone is 818/887-5800.  Toll
Free sales line is 800/621-0849 ext. 441.  (that's suite #200, above )

I must be one of the few who do not have Turbo Pascal (mostly

Is it feasible to try to compile Turbo code with the JRT

Turbo?

 This actually is more of a try to get into contact with you CP/M's
since my previous net-attempts failed. 
Main questions:
   how do I get on SIMTEL20 (tel.nr.) and do I need to be a CP/M member?
   Can I then download/upload stuff.

Attention: Cpm bboard

I would like to obtain a version of Xlisp to run on my old Kaypro II.  I have
heard that version 1.2 is too large for the 64k available in the Kaypro II.
Is this true?  Also, are there any versions that do not require the user to
have a C compiler?  Any pointers would be appreciated.

	       DBMS Applications Query Results - Summary

First of all, an apology for being sooo late on posting the results.
For those who don't remember ('cause it's been so long), I posted an
article entitled "Database Applications Query" to net.database,
net.micro, net.micro.pc, and net.micro.cpm, in mid January.  Overall I
got a really good response to the query - about 30 replys with actual
dbms applications, others that were just interested in the results.

I have organized the results as follows. I have created a table of
DBMS's that contains the name of the DBMS software, the manufacturer
(where known), the host environment it runs in, and a count of how many
people (who responded) using that DBMS. 

Next is a table containing the name of the DBMS and the application(s)
it is being used for. This is basically a summarized list of the actual
responses. The most interesting of the responses comes from Relational
Technology Inc. - The company that makes INGRES. Jeff Lichtman was kind
enough to send me a list of RTI's own applications of INGRES - How a
dbms manufacturer uses its own product!! It's in the list of dbms uses.

Most of the dbms applications  were pretty standard, such as mailing &
phone lists, inventories, etc. There were a few that were quite
interesting and some requests for some that have not been done. 

A few people were interested in bibliographic applications. This is
something that interests me personally, for it is not easy to create a
bibliographic database in a relational dbms. The problems are that you
need to have multiple occurances of some of the fields (such as Authors
and Keyword type fields). It is not good practice to have AUTHOR1,
AUTHOR2, etc., because 1/2 the time you only need 1 author, and one day
you'll find you need 6 when you have room for 5. Also, making an AUTHOR
field 265 characters long and putting them all in there is not quite
efficient either, and you'll have a hard time doing queries. I have been
working on a text based db program for bibliographic searches that
overcomes these problems. Some of the key features are: Text file
database with variable length fields and multiple occurances of a field.
Btree indecies on any desired field - primary key and secondary
(keyword type) keys. I don't want to go into details on that, if anyone
is interested they can mail me.

My own applications are, as I mentioned above, working on bibliographic
type dbms. Along with developing a text based db I have also done some
stuff in dBASE-III using the (yechh) method of having a long character
field. If the format is consistent in that type of schema, searches are
possible (e.g. assume authors or keywords are comma seperated). I also
have my own mailing/phone lists, check book balancing, and an inventory
of my record/tape collection - all in dBASE-II. One other thing I have
done - I worked at Xerox for 2 years - in the Customer Education Dept.
of Business Systems Group (El Segundo), and developed a dBASE-II
application for their National Registration. This was (as far as I was
concerned) taking dBASE-II to its limit. It was/is quite a system (if I
do say so myself). I can't even begin to go into the stuff it did. There
was a lot of house cleaning it did, automatically, printing of various
form letters (on a 2700 laser printer), printing of Certificates, etc.
The database grew quite large and ran very efficiently for what it was
running on (a Xerox 820-II w/a 10meg). Last I heard it was being
converted to dBASE-III. It had to deal with something like 7 .DBF files,
and even more indecies. There are cute ways of doing joins on more than
2 DBF's in dBASE-II (file flipping).

Enough blabbing. If anyone is interested in any of the specific
applications listed later on, send me mail and I will forward the
message containing that applications (then you can get in touch with the
person that sent it). If there are any other questions, feel free to
write. I hope someone finds the results usefull, and Thanks to all that
replied!!!!!

5.25 or 3.5 inch disks.  I would also be interested in  sys-

change things around so as to avoid using the CRT.  I have a
friend who wants to hook up a braille terminal thus a CRT is
of little use.

Message-ID: <665@oakhill.UUCP>
Date: 20 Mar 86 16:49:38 GMT
To:       info-cpm@AMSAA.ARPA

With the current trends of inexpensive hard disks it seems quite worthwhile
to upgrade an older system. I'd like to find out about the possibility of
adding more disk storage to a Kaypro 10. The options are:

1. Remove the present 10Meg disk (after dumping it on lots of floppies
   of course). Replace it with a 20Meg or larger disk. The physical
   requirements should be similar. The only changes I envision are
   modifying the BIOS and re-assembling and re-installing the system.

2. Keep the current 10Meg disk. Add an external 10M, 20M, or whatever
   size disk with its own enclosure and power supply. Here I'm not sure
   if there is another port that can connect to an external disk. The
   disk controller board should be able to control two drives though.
   The software mods should also be quite similar to 1 above.

Questions:
1. Has anybody done such an upgrade? If so, what are your trials and
   tribulations?
2. Are the schemes above possible or are there other options?
3. Can the disk controller in the 10 address more than 10Meg?

The machine's warranty had long expired and neither Kaypro nor dealers
are very interested in supporting the 10 anymore so an upgrade such as
this should not make the system any less maintainable than it already is.

Thanks for any comments or suggestions.

Message-ID: <813@well.UUCP>
Date: 20 Mar 86 16:52:57 GMT
To:       info-cpm@AMSAA.ARPA


Hello, all, a question for those with knowledge and a willingness towards
sharing it :

I have an old CP/M machine with the traditional Z80 and 64 kb RAM, and two
floppy disk drives, Shugart 801's ... 8", SS/DD.

These drives are, over the ages, becoming less and less reliable. So far as
I can tell, it's not a matter of hardware errors or anything, really, but
I continually get these little TRAC errors. ( Which means that the head is
not reading the track correctly, I believe. )

Now, from what I've read, it's quite common for your heads to drift from
the original alignment, and it's a relatively small matter to re-align them
if you have the appropriate devices to support your effort.

An oscilloscope, I have access to. What I need, I think, is a master disk,
a metal diskette with master tracks, made out of metal, instead of floppy
material - a hardware reference point by which the disk heads are aligned.
The standard 77 track, 8 inch, single density IBM 3740/1D format for which
these drives were made for.

I haven't really made a serious effort to look around for this, yet. I have
reason to believe (a) that they are generally unavailable in all the best
shops, as Shugart drives are basically as obsolete as skeleton keys, and
(b) that the drive manufacturers made these special alignment disks mostly
unavailable for the general public, to facilitate the existence of small
repair shops and discourage people from doing their own maintenance.

Does anyone out there in net.land have any ideas on where I might find such
a metallic master alignment diskette ? I'd be greatly appreciative, and so
would thousands of others with similiar problems, since the 8" diskette is
not yet dead, I suspect, and there must be others with a similiar problem ...

Thanks, awfully, lads and ladies ...

Try calling Dwight Worswick of Worswick Industries in San Diego.  I don't
have his number handy, but it's listed.  You might also try Mission Peak
Systems.  I'm not sure of their location, but they advertise in the
FOGHORN.

Could also be a seek error. just needs some VERY light machine oil on the
guide rods.

NO. The alignment disks (or "Analogue alignment disks" (same thing)) are
normal 8" floppy media, but with special info written on them.  Normal drive
electronics and controllers can't write this info.  These disk are usually
available from the major disk manufacturers such as Dysan, Memorex, Verbatim,
etc.  cost is about $50.

soooooo...

1) First check head stepping. I use DU or DUU to generate complex stepping
patterns, and then whatch for error messages, and also whatch the heads.

2) To do a re-alignment, you will need an analogue alignment disk, and a
dual channel scope (like a tek 465). The alignment disks come with instructions
for use. different tracks have different test patterns on them to facilitate
the various parts of the alignment process. Circuits for the drives can also
help

3) good luck.

4) If you need help, call me (408)737-8060 (after 7:00 pm)

[the disks in the drives go 'round and 'round]

	Due to bizarre circumstances, I am trying to read an 8"
floppy created by a Zilog MCZ2/50 (Z80 machine) running CPM2.2.

The manual says that the disks are 8 inch DSDD following the
IBM System 34 format, with a logical skew of 5.  Each logical
track is therefore 104 (4 x 26) 128 byte logical sectors.

Does anybody know the Disk Parameters that CP/M needs?
I need either the args to the DISKDEF macro, and/or the
result of the DISKDEF macro (the SPT, BLM, AL0, AL1...).

Thanks in advance

ADVENT Products (1-800-821-8778) (1-800-521-7182 in California)
offers a Turbo Rom, 20 megabyte hard disk and mounting hardware for slightly
over $800 (maybe less by now). The 20 meg mounts internally and your
present 10 megabyte plus the 20 megabyte add-in format to 33 megabytes.
If your Kaypro 10 has the 50 pin cable running to near the center of the
main board, instead of the edge of the board you will need a kit costing
8 or 9 dollars additional. If you have a Legacy clock you will need to
run one wire from the Legacy chip to the Turbo Rom chip. Installation
is easy, according to those I have talked to that installed. Mine is
on order. The Turbo Rom includes ZCPR1, lets you format diskettes with
256 directory entries rather than standard 64, lets you interface
directly with several other types of diskettes, including XEROX, Epson, etc.,
and also does much more, like write to disk 6 times faster, etc.
Advent also offers a 10 meg add-in, or a 32 meg replacement.

   No, the alignment diskette is not made of metal, it is made of very 
ordinary mylar, like any other diskette.  The nature and placement of the
signals recorded *ON* the diskette, however, are quite special.

   If you contact Verbatim Corpoation, I believe they will sell you an 8"
alignment diskette.  Expect to pay between $50 and $100 for it, however.
After that, all you need is the service manual for the drive, so you'll know
which test points to monitor for the "cats-eye" image used to align the head.

How about CP/M 2.2 ED? It's free with the CP/M... Nobody talks about it or
uses it very much these days so it may be not be mentioned in a prominent place
in your manuals, or it may not even be supplied on some distribution disks.
That's why I'm stating what might seem redundant.

My church was recently donated an Eagle II computer, allegedly
(from the documentation supplied) a CPM machine.  It came with
2 programs on 5 1/4" SS floppies, SPELLBIND and ULTRACALC
both of which run as stand alone programs.  The machine supposedly came
with CPM but whoever donated the machine did not supply that floppy
with it.

The question: Where can I get CPM for this machine?

Any and all help is extremely welcome and much appreciated.

I know that most of you are 8-bit CPMers, but maybe there is someone
out there using CPM-86 (or CCPM-86 or MPM-86) who can help me.  I am using
an Altos 586 running MPM-86.  I have a 20 meg (15 formatted) hard disk, but
I am always almost out of directory entries even though I have only filled
about half the disk.  The problem seems to be that the disk can only have
1024 directory entries and since XFCBs (which give me time/date stamping
and password protection which I really need) nearly double the number of
entries required (especially since I have a lot of little programs, etc.)
I can only have about 500 individual files on the drive.  In MPM-86, XFCBs
are optional but I think they are automatic in Concurrent CPM-86 so I am
probably not the only one with this problem.  MS-DOS doesn't have this problem
because the direectories (except the root) are stored as files.  I don't
need a directory structure - 16 user areas is plenty - but I could really
use the larger directory space.  The Altos manual briefly mentions multiple
logical drives on one physical drive but nowhere in the Altos or DRI
documentation does it say how to do this.  Does anyone know how to get around
this problem ???  Any help will be greatly appreciated.

I am running Concurrent CP/M.  The time/date stamping is optional and
uses 25% of the directory for the date and time info.  What you have to do
to partition your disk is to set up drive definition entries for each
partitiion.  One of the pieces of information in each table is how many
tracks to offset for the start of the "logical disk".  Perhaps you
remember for the floppy disks there are two tracks reserved for the system.
This uses the same entry to the table that I am describing for the 
partitioned hard disk.  There is no limit on the number of traks to
skip.  For instance if your disk has 315 tracks (cylinders), skip 0
for partition A, 105 for partition B, and 210 for partition C.  If there
are 6 heads and 9 1K sectors per track this divides the disk into three
5.6 Megabyte partitions.  There is no special reason why each partition
needs to be the same size.  Dividde it up however you like.  All of this
requires that you modify your BIOS and reassemble it.  You cannot do this
without the source code for at least this part of your BIOS.  Consult your
computer manuals.  I have set up my CompuPro system with an 8 Mbyte hard
disk as drive A and a 16 Mbyte hard disk with two 5 Mbyte and one 6 Mbyte
partitions.  It took me a while to figure all of the ins and outs of this,
especially having two different hard disks with differing partion schemes
but it is basically straight forward once you learn all the details you
would rather not have learned about your system.

Wwhich I've had poor success with on my Osborn (Pprobably my own fault) there
is also a powerful debugging program called Z8E, on SIMTEL20, with which one

Z8E - a Z80 DEBUGGING MONITOR has been released to the public (it's
copyrighted but permission has been given for non-profit use).

Z8E is a professional quality interactive debugging tool designed
to speed the testing of Z80 assembly language programs.   Origin-
ally written as a standalone monitor,  Z8E was used in the  deve-
lopement  of the world's largest Touch-Tone Input/Voice  Response
system.   Now redone to run in a CP/M or TurboDOS environment Z8E
contains  more features in less memory than any comparable  soft-
ware product.  Occupying less than 9K of memory, Z8E includes the
following among its many features:

      - Full screen animated display of the program under
	test while it is being executed by the Z80  (uses
	cursor addressing, configurable by the user).

      - Complete Z80 inline assembler,	with labels, sym-
	bols,  expressions,  and directives,  using Zilog
	mnemonics
			
      - Interactive  disassembly with labels and  symbols
	to  console  or disk allows the user  to  specify
	output formats and add comments 

      - Fully  traced program execution including a  full
	screen single step command that instructs Z8E  to
	disassemble  code  and to move the cursor to  the
	next instruction to execute

      - Up to 16 user settable breakpoints with  optional
	pass counts

      - True  symbolic	debugging  using the  input  from
	multiple   Microsoft  MACRO-80 .PRN  and  LINK-80
	.SYM  files and Z80ASM .LST and SLRNK and  Z80ASM
	.SYM files from SLR Systems.

      - Dynamic relocation of Z8E at load time to the top
	of   user  memory regardless of  size.	 No  user
	configuration of any kind is required.	

The files are available as:

I have just added a version of the communications program, Kermit, to
the simtel20 archives (in the <CPM.OSBORN> directory).  It is called
PD:<CPM.OSBORN>EXKERMIT.LBR.  I took the generic cpm kermit written in
turbo pascal (which did not run on my Executive) and modified it to run.
I also added a 'break.' This will only run on the Osborne Executive.

I have just added a program to simtel20 to do a 'read track.' This
program is written in assembly language and is designed to be used with
'sid' the debugging package that comes (or rather, came) with the
Executive.  If you don't know assembly language, or how to use 'sid,'
this program is not for you.  It is named PD:<CPM.OSBORN>RDTRAK.LBR AT
SIMTEL20.

I have just added to simtel20 a program to do windows (not wash windows,
just create them!)  on the Osborne Executive.  This program will split
the full screen into two windows (either horizontally or vertically) so
that you can run a program in window 1, then leave data in that window.
You can then switch to window 2 and run a program there while the data
from the first program is still in window 1.  In effect, you can have
the data from one program in window 1 for your observation while you run
another program in window 2.  Try it!  (Maybe) You'll like it!  It is in
PD:<CPM.OSBORN>EXWINDOW.LBR.

          I am looking for a CP/M system that can be run completely from an
          external  terminal.   I  want  one  with  either 5.25 or 3.5 inch
          disks.   I would also be interested in systems that have at least
          two  rs232 ports.  That way I could change things around so as to
          avoid  using  the  CRT.   I  have a friend who wants to hook up a
          braille terminal thus a CRT is of little use.

             Robert Jaquiss

At this installation we have quite a number of Morrow MD2/MD3 systems using
external  CRT's  as consoles.  The MD machines are designed to operate that
way;  i.e.,  the  console  is  an  external terminal device attached to the
mainboard via a standard 232 interface.  The complete MD package included a
terminal  sold  by Morrow, but we purchased only the boxes and used our own
terminals.  It has proved to be a very workable arrangement.  We use CRT's,
but  any  232 ASCII device could be attached to the console port (a braille
device,  for example).

The  MD machines are 64K, Z80 CP/M devices with 5.25 inch disk drives.  All
of our machines have 2 drives, but the hardware, as shipped, will handle up
to  4.   The  systems have two 232 ports, one for the console and one for a
serial printer or modem.

Unfortunately,  the MD series is no longer manufactured.  I understand that
that  Morrow  is  in  Chapter 11.  In any case, they ceased producing 8 bit
devices  several  months  ago.   Still,  there  are a lot of MD devices out
there;  you  might  be  able  to  obtain  a  used one.  I think it is to be
recommended for the application described above.

LASM.COM
LASM.DOC
LASM2.AQM
LASM2.DOC
LASM3.LBR
)
Fine, fast 8080/Z80 assembler, only needs a little fiddling with
.ASM source for a few little differences.
Permits linking also .. we used it to assemble the CP/M Kermit
with no significant problems.

Subject:  Significant change:

Fellow CP/Mers - Those of you who are familiar with goings-on in the Defense
Data Network will know that a new addressing scheme called "domain addressing"
is being used in the ARPANET and tried on a voluntary basis by many hosts in
the MILNET.  And it will soon become the mandatory standard in the MILNET too.
For those unfamiliar with this change, let's just say that domain addressing
is a scheme that allows for a larger number of address paths while requiring
users to do a lot of typing that used to be done by machines (sigh).

     Because of the brutal editing job required, I have valiantly procras-
tinated about fixing the info-cpm distribution list to use the new
addresses.  But as luck (and good friends) would have it, my buddy Brint
Cooper (a fellow BRL employee and CP/Mer) volunteered! to do the deed, for
which I will be eternally grateful.

     The edited list has been subjected to the scrutiny of the address-
checker program we use here, and no errors were found in either format or
hostname-address-strings.  Theoretically, there should have been no changes in
the username portions of the addresses, but we all know that editor programs
sometimes do strange and wonderful things.  So be warned that tomorrow
(Friday) I am going to install the new list, and we'll see what happens.  If
anyone's info-cpm mail suddenly dries up, don't be bashful; COMPLAIN AT ONCE!

I received several replies to my query about how to increase directory entries
on a hard disk running under MPM-86.  I will attempt to make the changes this
Sunday.   In the meantime, I have some more questions.
Is there any easy way to add an equivalent to the MS-DOS AUTOEXEC.BAT to
an MPM system?  The system normally runs 24 hours a day, but I would
like it to automatically run a couple programs on powerup/reset.  It would
be really nice if I could run different programs on each console - then
I could have a logon program on the modem port.  I know this could probably
be done by modifying the TMP.RSP or the BIOS, but I only have source to
the machine dependent XIOS.

In recent BYTE's, Micromint in Connecticut has been advertising their
SB180 single-board system.  It uses the Hitachi 64180 (Z-80 compatible
chip), has 256K RAM, 1 parallel & 2 serial I/O ports, and is 4" X 7.5"
in size.  It costs $449. with software.  Given the current cost of
floppy drives, one should be able to add two drives and a power supply
and come in for about $750-800.  Micromint's address/phone is 25 Terrace
Dr, Vernon CT 06066,  203-871-6170.

For even less, Ampro has their Z-80 'Little Board' for $249.  Same
general idea; but using the Z-80A as a processor.  Their address/phone
is Ampro Computers, 67 E Evelyn Ave, Mountain View CA 94041 415-962-0230.

Hope the information proves useful.

	It's been awhile since I heard this, but from what I recall, Ellis
Computing bought the rights to JRT Pascal when JRT folded.  Also, contrary to
the previous message, JRT is *NOT* public domain.  The documentation DID
however say that you could give copies to your friends, so I guess it comes
down to about the same thing.  As a side note, the JRT folks were the ones to
come up with the idea of an inexpensive compiler.  They failed in the
marketplace because even though the price was right $29.95, the program wasn't
worth anything.  It is not a compiler, it's a pseudo-compiler, it goes to
P-Code like UCSD Pascal.  JRT is worth a try, especially if you can find it
locally, it did have some nice features.  Turbo however is a much better
compiler, it's fast and although it has some limitations, compiles to native
code.

Yes, most software for CP/M 2.x will run under CP/M 3.0, including WordStar.

> 2.  Where can I get wordstar for CPM?

The local Federated TV/Stero/Computer discount stores are offering WordStar 
with MailMerge for $399 on a special sale this week.  The installation files 
for WordStar are included.  Also included are the following packages at no 
extra cost:  ReportStar, CalcStar, DataStar, CP/M 2.2, and a Bondwell 12 
portable (sic) computer.  You'd probably have to use a serial transfer
protocol to get the software on disks compatible with your Commodore.  If
you don't want the "free" computer, I'll be happy to take it! :-)

The Bondwell 12 has a 4 MHz Z80A, 64K RAM, two SSDD 5.25" floppy disk drives
(TEC, 765 controller), a full ASCII keyboard with separate numeric keypad and
16 user-definable function keys, 9-inch amber CRT (6845), two RS232C serial
ports (Z80A SIO/8253 baud rate generator), a parallel port (6821), and speech
synthesis capability.  Comes with program to allow SSDD disks in Kaypro,
Osborne, and IBM PC formats to be used.  Size, weight, etc.  are compatible
with the Osborne/Kaypro portables.  Looks like it is a Hong-Kong Kaypro 2
clone.  It also comes with a neat speech program that lets you type in
sentences which it will then speak back to you.  Can also voice annotate
prepared files.  The speech is obviously computer-generated, but very
understandable.

Someone asked on the net earlier about a tool to help the speech-impaired.
The Bondwell 12 may just be the answer...

I need another CP/M computer about as much as a hole in the head, but in a
weak moment, I purchased one of these machines last Saturday.  Only problem so
far is that no real technical info comes with the package.  You do get full
manuals on all the MicroPro packages plus the latest versions of DRI's CP/M
2.2 manual and command summary booklet.  The manual on the computer itself is
oriented towards the inexperienced, non-technical user.  I have found that a
technical manual with schematics is available from Bondwell for $25, BIOS on
disk is $10.  Even without the technical manual, I have done some sleuthing
around and have been able to modify the excellent MXO-KP43.ASM file (Kaypro
uses the Z80 SIO but a different baud rate generator) and I now have a working
overlay for MEX 1.14.

Features I don't like about the machine:  SSDD 5.25" disks are small, the
Bondwell format provides only 170K/disk.  The feel and size of the keyboard
are less than ideal and the key layout is more like a TTY instead of the more
common VT100/Selectric layout.  There is no fan in the unit and it gets
warmer than I'd like to see for extended reliability.  The video display uses
a good font, with decenders, looks ADM3 compatible, but doesn't support
half-intensity.

Obviously (I hope), I have no connection with Bondwell International.
With only 2 days experience with the package, I hesitate to give it any
strong recommendation, but how can you beat it for the price?

One thing discussed in the original posting concerns me.  I, too, have
received suggestions about LIGHTLY oiling BOTH the guide rods and the
lead screw itself.  However, when I dug out my Shugart  Associates
Maintenance Manual, it clearly states that NO lubrication of the drive
should be done, as the lubrication "allows dust and dirt to accumulate".
I once read a tale about someone who 'lubricated' the lead screw in his
drive with WD-40.  Unfortunately, it disolved something which must have
coated the lead screw into a goopy mess!  Is there anyone who can 
contribute pro or con points of view about guide rod and/or lead screw
lubrication?  

I have one other suggestion for ailing Shugart drives (and perhaps others,
too).  I found that the little plastic and cloth button which pushes
against the back side of the floppy disk in order to ensure good read/write
head contact with the disk may need attention.  It is called the R/W Head
Load Button.  These are present ONLY on single-sided drives, obviously.
The buttons on my Shugart drives had a very glossy appearance, I suspect
from some bad disks which caused excessive oxide build-up.  The maintenance
procedure in the Shugart manual describes rotating the head load button
to improve the amplitude of the read/write head signal. 

Finally, (sorry for the length), Shugart's part number for their 'Alignment
Diskette' is SA120-1.  This was obtained from an OLD manual, there may be
a newer revision.

I have used 2:
	UVMAC - from Software Toolworks, 14478 Glorietta Drive, Sherman Oaks,
	California, 91423 (213)986-4885
	[ warning : that address is circa 1980 ]
	A decent, straightforward few-frills absolute assembler for
	Zilog Z80 mnemonics. Two of the frills are a Macro facility and
	conditional assembly.

	M80 - from MicroSoft, 10700 Northup Way, Bellevue, Washington 98004
	(206) 828-8080 <= really.. :-)
	This is the Rolls-Royce of 8080 assemblers ( that I've seen ), and
	will also assemble Z80 mnemonics. All the macro and conditional
	assembly and listing control and etc. that your little heart could
	want. This is a relocatable assembler which produces an object
	module which must be linked using the supplied linker L80. It can
	also be linked with other modules, or with stuff from an object
	library, such as produced by the program LIB80, also supplied.
	( You can roll your own object libraries ).
	The sophistication can make it harder to learn - but well worth it
	if you are going to be writing a lot of code.
	M80, L80, and LIB80 are supplied with MicroSoft's compilers such as
	FORTRAN, COBOL and the MBASIC compiler. I guess you could get them
	separately.

Disclaimer: I have no connection with MicroSoft or The Software Toolworks
	other than having used their products. I do not stand to gain either
	from distributing this notice or from any sale of the above products.

As to reliability, I have used M80 enough to know that if there are any bugs
in M80 or L80, they are hiding pretty darn well. ( Actually, I know of a
couple of tiny problems with M80, but they only arise when your code is
incorrect in a very obscure way and I wouldn't sweat it ).

I haven't used UVMAC much, but it has never given me any trouble.

Check out ZAS, the Z80 assembler package sold for $69 by Echelon.  Can
generate .HEX or .REL files, includes linker and 8080 to Z80 translator.

The local Federated discount appliance stores are selling the Bondwell 12 for 
$399 this week.  Also included are the following software packages at no extra 
cost: WordStar, MailMerge, ReportStar, CalcStar, DataStar, and CP/M 2.2. 

The Bondwell 12 has a 4 MHz Z80A, 64K RAM, two SSDD 5.25" floppy disk drives
(TEC, 765 controller), a full ASCII keyboard with separate numeric keypad and
16 user-definable function keys, 9-inch amber CRT (6845), two RS232C serial
ports (Z80A SIO/8253 baud rate generator), a parallel port (6821), and speech
synthesis capability.  Comes with program to allow SSDD disks in Kaypro,
Osborne, and IBM PC formats to be used.  Size, weight, etc.  are compatible
with the Osborne/Kaypro portables.  Looks like it is a Hong-Kong Kaypro 2
clone.

It also comes with a neat speech program that lets you type in sentences which 
it will then speak back to you.  Can also voice annotate prepared files.  The 
speech is obviously computer-generated, but very understandable.  Your friend 
with the Braille terminal might want to try "SPEECH"ing a file instead of 
"TYPE"ing it...

I need another CP/M computer about as much as a hole in the head, but in a 
weak moment, I purchased one of these machines last Saturday.  Only problem so 
far is that no real technical info comes with the package.  You do get full 
manuals on all the MicroPro packages plus the latest versions of DRI's CP/M 
2.2 manual and command summary booklet.  The manual on the computer itself is 
oriented towards the inexperienced, non-technical user.  I have found that a 
technical manual with schematics is available from Bondwell for $25, BIOS on 
disk is $10.  Even without the technical manual, I have done some sleuthing 
around and have been able to modify the excellent MXO-KP43.ASM file (Kaypro 
uses the Z80 SIO but a different baud rate generator) and I now have a working 
overlay for MEX 1.14. (The MEX overlay also includes my USR Password stuff
and is in Z80 code so I won't post it, but will mail a copy if interested.)

Features I don't like about the machine:  SSDD 5.25" disks are small, the
Bondwell format provides only 170K/disk.  The feel and size of the keyboard
are less than ideal and the key layout is more like a TTY instead of the more

To: Info Cpm newsletter <INFO-CPM@AMSAA.ARPA>

Well, I received many replies to my directory problem.  The easiest seemed
to be to change a couple of numbers (Alloc0/1, #dir. entries -1) in the
XIOS and everything should work right away.  Unfortunately, that didn't
work.  I did get 2048 directory entries (instead of 1024), but I also got
a lot of garbage in the directory after the MPM system files.  I decided to
give it another try.  I looked at the XIOS files again.  The only other number
which seemed like it should have an effect was the number of directory tracks
to cache (the Altos has a 64K disk cache which speeds things up a lot).
Anyway, I got the same results.  I think the problem is that INSTMPM (an Altos
utility to install MPM on the hard disk) may have certain values such as the
# of directory entries hardcoded in some way so that even when I change them
in the XIOS, the initial installation will mess up the directory.  I don't
know what to do next.  I don't want to try multiple logical disks,
because I know that is more complicated and therefore more likely to run
into similar problems.  If anyone out there has any ideas, please let me know.
The solution might be to bypass INSTMPM, but since I have never installed a
hard disk without, I am not sure what I need to do.  I don't know how to
initialize the hard disk other than that the Altos manual says to erase
the disk to E5E5 before installing MPM.  There is a word in the XIOS that
specifies what type of disk(s) are on the system, and it appears to be changed
by INSTMPM.

    	ZNODES22.LST - in PD:<ZSYS.DOC> and PD:<ZSYS.NEW>
    		Listing of all Z-Nodes, as of 11 March

Rick, there has been a problem with someone mis-naming the ZNODES
lists.  I've had the last four versions uploaded to my RCP/M with
filenames that were HIGHER numbered than the header of the file says.
This one is no exception.  Here's the header from your ZNODES22.LST:

.lh 7
.rm 79
.cw 11
.po 7
Echelon Z-Node List #20                                        11 March 1986

I already have a ZNODES20.LST, dated March 3, 1986.

It didn't work.

I figured out the DDT86 commands to fill a chunk of memory with E5s, and write
it to a file.  I did that.  The file did go at the beginning of the directory,
though I have no way of knowing if it went for sure at the beginning of
the disk.  I made a couple pips with [o] until it appeared at the end of the
dir.  I made the changes to the XIOS, asembled, gencmd, pip, gensys, etc.
I rebooted and I got a mess - bad sector error anytime it tried to read a CMD
file (or look for one) on the disk.  It did boot though, just wasn't very
useful after it booted.  Oh well.  If you have any more ideas please let me
know.  I think the problem is that to really get it to work right, I need
someone who has done this on an Altos 586 and knows what they are doing.
Unfortunately, since the machine is used for a business during the week, I
have to restore it to its former state.  If someone has any more suggestions,
I am still willing to try them - this really shouldn't be as hard as it is.

Subject: ZAS Bugs???
To: info-cpm@AMSAA.ARPA

It appears that the Mitek ZAS assembler sold with the MicroMint
SB180 board MAY have a minor bug or two in the parsing and error detec-
tion portion.  While manually converting some code from Intel 8080 to
Zilog Z80 mnemonics and manually expand some macros (Why do things the
easy way when there is a hard way available?), I inadvertantly entered
the following incorrect mnemonics:
        SUB     A,' '
        SUB     HL,DE
   Both, with some variants, were accepted by the assembler with no
errors or warnings.  The first appeared to assemble properly, but should
have been entered as:
        SUB     ' '
   The second was the cause of loss of hair over the weekend due to much
scratching.  It generated a single 19H byte which is "ADD  HL,DE".  The
desired opcode should have been "SBC  HL,DE", since the "SUB" is invalid
for 16-bit operations.  Both of these are flagged by M80.
   The version of ZAS used was 2.0 purchased last fall with the SB180.

Message-ID: <[MC.LCS.MIT.EDU].866660.860331.GRUPP>

I have discovered another minor bug in Z8E.COM (the super Z80 debugger)
in the terminal I/O section.  It mixes direct and normal I/O Bdos calls
which sometimes causes the Bdos to return incorrect status to Z8E.
Another problem with the I/O the way it stands is that terminals which
require no bias to be added to the ROW or COLUMN get bad cursor posistion
information as the normal Bdos I/O calls expand ROW or COLUMN 9 (tab) to
some number of spaces.  Fortunately the fix is simple and can be entered
using Z8E and the Z8E.SYM file.  Following are the commands you type
to patch this from CP/M.  A <return> is typed after every line.

Z8E Z8E.COM Z8E.SYM
A TTYQ+3
LD C,6
LD E,FF
CALL BDOS
POP HL
POP DE
POP BC
AND 7F
RET
<return>    <-extra return needed to exit A command
A TTYO+5
LD C,6
<return>    <-again
W Z8E.COM
G 0

That's all there is to it.

Subject:  SIMTEL20

I would like to download from the SIMTEL20 archives but I cannot figure
out a way. I am at a bitnet node and cannot use FTP. I have thought of
two ways to possibly get the files:

Is there a way to send a batch of commands as a file to be executed on
the SIMTEL20 machine?

If this is impossible, is there a phone number in which I can (legally)
dial up the SIMTEL20 machine and logon as ANONYMOUS, then send the files
to myself at my bitnet node? (I have a 300 baud modem)

Any help would be appreciated.

                                       Thanks - John Schulien.

Thanks for your note, Keith.  These files are compiled
by Echelon, and the ZNODES LST I uploaded came directly from them,
so I suspect it is an oversight on their part.  Will report it.

Hal, the current version of ZAS is 2.2, and the bug you reported has
been fixed (actually, the version is 2.2A).  Note:
