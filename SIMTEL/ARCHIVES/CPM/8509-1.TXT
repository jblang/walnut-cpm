Indeed!

Actually, my first reaction was that a destructive trojan horse program is
an act of vandalism.  On deeper consideration, it is much worse.  Perhaps it
is the digital equivalent of a letter-bomb.  Reasoning:
  o it can be devastating in destructive potential to the unfortunate user
  o it can go off when you least expect it
  o an innocent person (like the mailman) probably handed it to you
  o the perpetrator can cover his tracks very well
There are a couple of major differences:
  o it can proliferate, injuring more than just the intended victim
  o these guys probably had no single victim in mind

Restitution is one thing, but this crime needs more than just that.  Sadly, the
perpetrators will probably never be found, so there is little use in brewing up suitable punishment.

  Does anyone know where I might find a copy of the ANSI X3.64 spec, pref-
erably on the net somewhere (and preferably, available for FTP)?  I just
purchased _A Programmer's Guide to Video Display Terminals_ (a fine source
for terminal data, by the way: data sheets on 145 different terminals.  ISBN 0-936158-01-8; entire data base available on separate diskette), and it makes several references to the ANSI standard, but doesn't say much about what the standard involves.  Any pointers much appreciated.		--Ron Fowler

[]

I have been asked to recommend a statistical package for a psychology prof
with a CP/M machine (really, an Altos MP/M II machine).  He needs chi square,
analasys of variance, Pearson's coefficient, one-way and two-way T tests,
as well as the simpler computations (mean, standard deviation, and the like).
The ability to present the statistical data is important, but the ease of
editing data is vital.  Any ideas on which product(s) I should recommend?
Please respond by mail.

Version 10.0 of the W0RLI MailBox/Gateway has been released.  The
sources and binaries have been posted to SIMTEL20, and are also
available on disk from the author.

The changes since the last such posting, version 9.3, are summarized
below in an extract from the NOTES.TNC file.

For those who have not seen this system before, a brief description:

The W0RLI MailBox and GateWay is a system which runs on a Xerox 820
computer and which operates on Amateur Packet Radio via one or two
TAPR TNCs (or clones). It also runs with TNC-2s (W3IWI is running one).

The W0RLI system is running at over 75 sites in some number of
countries and makes up the majority of the packet mail forwarding
system. It is also used for gatewaying between local packet areas and
long haul links on HF, or to nearby nets on other VHF/UHF bands.
For a more complete description, see NOTES.TNC.


Hank is not on ARPANET or Usenet.  I will be glad to relay comments
and questions to him.  If you want the distribution on disk, send
a self-addressed stamped 8" SSSD disk (in re-usable mailer) to Hank at
his callbook address. Two disks if you want the sources as well.
To reduce the load on Hank, I will do the same under the same conditions.
I am also good in the Callbook.

Subject: MDM7 vs MEX

David, I'm sorry you have't tried MEX114 yet and feel it's too complex
compared to MDM7.  It has an identical user-interface to MDM7xx with
command extensions that you can OPTIONALLY use (you could continue to
use the commands you already know until you learn more about it).
Wouldn't you find it much easier, for instance, to tell MEX something
like GET TOADBIOS.ASM and have it automatically send out the command
to your host to start the transfer and then additionally tell itself
to R TOADBIOS.ASM?  This is easy to do with MEX's READ files!  I have
another that I use with RCPM transfers that lets me say:

GETL SAP44 SAP44.COM    which automatically sends out to the other end:

XMODEM L SAP44 SAP44.COM  to extract that file from SAP44.LBR

and then it tells MEX:

R SAP44.COM

It lets me automatically dial a list of phone numbers, dynamically
load key strings, phone numbers (with optional baud rate specification
as a part of the phone number list), send out complex automatic
logins, do BYE at the end of a session, etc.

It's like having SUBMIT inside MDM7!

Subject:   WA8DED v 0.91 firmware for TAPR TNC-1 available
ReSent-From: KPETERSEN@SIMTEL20.ARPA
ReSent-To: Info-Cpm@BRL.ARPA
ReSent-Date: Mon 2 Sep 1985 20:36-MDT

This message announces the posting of version 0.91 of the WA8DED
firmware for the TAPR TNC-1.  It has been posted on SIMTEL20 on the
ARPANET.  Some Usenet guru will have to carry on from there for the
usenet folks.

The files are available from SIMTEL20 as:
Filename			Type	 Bytes	 CRC

Directory MICRO:<CPM.PACKET>
TNCDED.DOC.1			ASCII	 30130  CF05H
TNCDED.HEX.2			ASCII	 46093  9F06H
TNCDED.MSG.1			ASCII	  4211  3D8CH

This firmware runs on the TAPR TNC-1 and its clones, the AEA and the
Heath HD-4040 TNCs.  It is NOT an upgrade of the TAPR code. It is
a completely new implementation of the AX.25 protocol, both the
current version 2.0 and the older 1.x version supported by the normal
TAPR code. It also supports up to four simultaneously open connections
on one TNC.  And it has a "host friendly" mode, which is intended to
simplify the interfacing of the TNC to a Bulletin Board or other
computer system. It has noticeably fewer protocol bugs than the
TAPR code, and a much more informative Monitor mode.

The command interface is NOT the same as the TAPR TNC code.  It is
therefore not just an improvement for your TNC, but a complete change
of the interface. So you might not want it if you (or your computer)
are used to the standard interface.

The files posted are: This message, TNCDED.MSG; The documentation
file, TNCDED.DOC; and the binary of the code itself, in Intel Hex
format, in TNCDED.HEX.

The code occupies two 2764 EPROMs (actually about 1.2 EPROMs -
plenty of space left in the second one).  The EPROMs reside at
C000 and E000 of the TNC, sockets U11 and U12 respectively.  If
you need to manipulate this file with a CP/M DDT, remember to use
an offset with the I command so that you don't overwrite your
DDT, BDOS and BIOS. Put C000 through DFFF into the EPROM for U11,
and put E000 through FFFF into the EPROM for U12.

The code and documentation are copyrighted 1985 by Ronald Raikes,
WA8DED. They are submitted with his permission for non-commercial
use by individual Radio Amateurs. All other rights reserved by
Ronald Raikes.

The program is written in 6809 assembler. The source code is not
being posted, but is available from Ron by sending him an 8" SSSD
CP/M format disk in a reusable mailer with return postage.
Enclose a letter agreeing to the above personal use restriction.
To ease the load on Ron, I will also make copies under the same ground
rules.

When I talked to him today, he sounded somewhat overwhelmed by the 
number of people contacting him about getting copies of the ROMs.
I hope that by posting them here I will reduce that load on him, not
increase it.  Please use your discretion before adding to the crowd
of people contacting him.  But if you have to, ...

You can reach Ron by packet through the forwarding mailbox network.
Address him as WA8DED @ KD6SQ.  He is not on ARPANET or Usenet.
His US mail address is:

	Ronald Raikes, WA8DED
	9211 Pico Vista Road
	Downey, CA 90240

If you want to mail me a disk, as offered above, I'm good in the
callbook.

The following message ported from the WA6OSA Packet Mailbox:

*** Message from WA6OSA to ALL entered Thursday 01-Aug-85 at 8:45 PM
*** Subject: ++NEW IMPROVED++ WA8DED FIRMWARE FEATURES

Version 0.9 of the WA8DED firmware for the TAPR TNC-1 compatables is
now available.  It is written in 6809 assembly language and is
contained in two 2764 EPROMs.  Some of its outstanding features are:

1. Up to four simultaneous connects (plus unproto).
2. Easy to read 'monitor' frame information in unproto mode.
3. Simple 'On Screen' Calibration.
4. Digipeats version 2 protocol.
5. Meaningful channel status display (separate status for each channel).
6. Supports modem baud rates up to 9600 baud.
7. New-Improved Host Mode (for computer interface).
8. Display of link state and number of free buffers.
9. XON-XOFF flow control
10.Auto-Unattended/Beacon Mode.

Version 1.0 should be available around the first of September and is
contained in two 2764 EPROMS.  The W6IXU mailbox is currently using a
beta version 0.9 of the WA8DED firmware.

Subject: Z8E - at last! a free Z80 debugger for CP/M

Z8E - a Z80 DEBUGGING MONITOR has been released to the public (it's
copyrighted but permission has been given for non-profit use).

Z8E is a professional quality interactive debugging tool designed
to speed the testing of Z80 assembly language programs.   Origin-
ally written as a standalone monitor,  Z8E was used in the  deve-
lopement  of the world's largest Touch-Tone Input/Voice  Response
system.   Now redone to run in a CP/M or TurboDOS environment Z8E
contains  more features in less memory than any comparable  soft-
ware product.  Occupying less than 9K of memory, Z8E includes the
following among its many features:

      - Full screen animated display of the program under
	test while it is being executed by the Z80  (uses
	cursor addressing, configurable by the user).

      - Complete Z80 inline assembler,	with labels, sym-
	bols,  expressions,  and directives,  using Zilog
	mnemonics
			
      - Interactive  disassembly with labels and  symbols
	to  console  or disk allows the user  to  specify
	output formats and add comments 

      - Fully  traced program execution including a  full
	screen single step command that instructs Z8E  to
	disassemble  code  and to move the cursor to  the
	next instruction to execute

      - Up to 16 user settable breakpoints with  optional
	pass counts

      - True  symbolic	debugging  using the  input  from
	multiple   Microsoft  MACRO-80 .PRN  and  LINK-80
	.SYM  files and Z80ASM .LST and SLRNK and  Z80ASM
	.SYM files from SLR Systems.

      - Dynamic relocation of Z8E at load time to the top
	of   user  memory regardless of  size.	 No  user
	configuration of any kind is required.	

The files are available as:

Filename			Type	 Bytes	 CRC

Directory MICRO:<CPM.DEBUG>
Z8E.LBR.1			BINARY	104704  1D4CH
...which contains the .COM, DOC, and SYM for patching cursor control.

Z8E.MQC.1			BINARY	112512  4925H
...the source code, for those who wonder how it works.  This was not
put into the LBR because I felt not everyone would need the source and
the LBR is already VERY big.

If you are unable to access Simtel-20 because of network restrictions
please remember that MOST of the new files announced to Info-Cpm are
also available on my RCPM Royal Oak (MI) which may be accessed at 300
bps using the 103a modem mode or 1200 bps using either the 212a or
Vadic 3400 modes.  The telephone number is (313) 759-6569.

Subject: MXM-2403 new small 2400 overlay for MEX

In SIMTEL20 directory PD:<CPM.MEX> you'll find MXM2403.AQM,
MXM-2403.DQC, MXO-KP43.AQM, and MXO-TV13.AQM (and temporarily
MXM-2403.LBR which contains all four).

MXM-2403.ASM is version 1.3 of the MEX overlay for external Hayes
Smartmodem 2400's and US Robotics Courier 2400's. NOTE that you will
ALSO need a serial port overlay to use with this one..  Your serial
port overlay should NOT have any dial routine or special code to
support Smartmodems or it will conflict with this overlay. The
MXO-KP43.ASM and MXO-TV13.ASM overlays included in this .LBR file are
examples of "basic" overlays.. (KP43 is for most Kaypro computers and
TV13 for the Televideo TS-802.)

The patch process, if followed as shown in the DOC file, should work
provided you find the proper overlay for your system and assemble them
with ASM or MAC or RMAC or M80.. (Some overlays may not assemble
properly under ASM, read the comments in the overlay...)

Be sure to get the MEX114 version which supports 1k packet mode,
especially important at 2400 baud..

X.PC PROTOCOL SPECIFICATIONS                    NPD-269     $3.00    

This specification is published by McDonnell Douglas as a proposal to
designers and implementors of personal computer communications
software and packet network systems.

It defines the formats and procedures at X.PC's packet and data line
layers for Data Terminal Equipment (DTE) and Data Communications
Equipment (DCE).  Both switched virtual call and permanent virtualy
call modes of operation are defined.

This specification covers DTE and DCE operation when a packet switched
network is accessed through a circuit switched or dedicated
connection.  It also includes the additional packet layer procedures
necessary for two DTEs to communicate directly (i.e., without an
intervening packet switched network) over dedicated or circuit
switched connection.

[Keith: this is the much-talked-about "error-free terminal protocol"
now supported by TYMNET.  It is an interesting alternative to
MICROCOM's "MNP" protocol which you must buy a new modem to get (and
which requires the "other end" to also have this type modem).  If we
could get BBN to support the X.PC protocol in the TAC software, we
could have error-free sessions in spite of occasional noise on the
phone lines.]

           ****  5" / 8" Hangup Fix for CCS 2422  ****

     This information originally compiled by Joe Wright at  Alpha 
Systems - the creator of Z3-Dot-Com.  Joe found the hardware bug, 
and contacted CCS;  they acknowledged that they knew about it and 
took  Joe's  fix.    However,  this  information  never  got  any 
widespread distribution so here it is:

     The  CCS  2422 disk controller has a problem  switching  the 
1Mhz  and 2Mhz oscillator inputs to the WD179X  controller;  this 
appears  to  the user as an occasional lockup of the  board  when 
both  5"  and  8" drives are active.  The only way  out  of  this 
condition  is  to reboot the system (often not a  very  promising 
alternative).  The  problem is that the standard  board  switches 
freqs  on  the wrong edge of the clock.  This can be remedied  as 
follows:
  
     1)  Isolate  the clocks to U38 (pins 3 and 11) so that  they 
are  no  longer clocked by the RCLK signal,  but make  sure  that 
there is still a path to U8 pin 26 from U18 pin 9.  On the Rev  B 
baords  (and possibly others) this can be easily done by  cutting 
an  etch below U38 where the signals to pins 3 and 11 combine and 
go  through the board.   By making the cut at the correct  place, 
you can reduce the number of necessary jumpers to two.

     2)  Run  the  1Mhz signal from U15 pin 12  through  a  spare 
inverter  at U28 pin 9 (or any other spare inverter) and take the 
output from U28 pin 8 to U38 pins 3 and 11 (the clock inputs just 
isolated).

     Since  this mod requires a little cutting and pasting on the 
PC  board,  it is not for the weak at heart,  and  neither  Alpha 
Systems  nor  myself (Mike Niswonger) can be responsible for  any 
damage done to the system by improperly done mods.   This mod has 
been running on at least three systems for anywhere from 2  years 
to 3 months, with no known problems.  

     For further information on CCS S-100 boards,  drop a note to 
CNISWONGERill be glad to share  any  experiences 
both  good  and  bad.   In  addition,  I will try and  act  as  a 
clearinghouse for any other contributed CCS bug notes and  fixes, 
since we seem to have been abandoned by the company.

                                   Mike Niswonger,
                                   CNiswonger@Simtel20

Subject: MIX editor
To: info-cpm@AMSAA.ARPA
Message-ID: <COR-ACB-7M20X@OFFICE-2>

Is the MIX editor written in Turbo?  I have a quarrel with whatever medium 
level language it is written in (at least the CP/M implementation).  It seems 
that the stack is mismanaged so that, should your system run with interrupts 
enabled, MIX won't work (and other software using the same language,I assume). 
Seems most likely that the stack pointer is being manipulated via arithmetic 
and that POPd values are assumed to remain valid.  Other possiblity is that 
small stacks are allocated and interrupts cause these to overflow.  Some other 
explanation?  Whatever, MIX is unusable on my system because of interference 
with interrupts.  I am curious what langauge is involved so that I don't waste 
my money buying it.

Other comments about MIX are that it is reasonably powerful.  I got it to 
behave like Magic Wand (my favorite editor) and its macro capability seems very
nice (especially for the price).  It is, however, VERY slow and VERY large 
(medium level languages again).  Even with tons of overlays only a 16K buffer 
is left on my 59K Northstar system (Magic Wand leave over 40K).

I got it because it handles split screens and was programmable.  I will 
probably use it for those tasks that require those features.  Must be a lot 
better with bigger memories and faster CPU's.  Is writing fast, compact, and 
powerful code a lost art?

I think you're right that someone made an S-100 board to operate BSR house
controllers.  I don't remember the details, as I was turned off by the
idea of running 110 volts onto a PC board.

There was also an article by Ciarcia in Byte that described a circuit to
throw ultrasonic pulses at the BSR controller box.

But I think the method of choice now (at least I chose it) is the
Heath GD-1530. It takes an EIA serial line (transmit side only) and
reads commands like "A1<return> AON<return>" to turn on module 1 of house A.

This was not initially the method of choice because it was ridiculously
expensive at $250. But it was reduced to $99 a while ago, which makes it
much more reasonable.  I guess 8748s got cheaper.

This is probably going to contain far more than you wanted to know,
but...

Any ANSI standard can be ordered through ANSI's order department, 1430
Broadway, New York, NY 10018.  I would suggest that you try to get them
on the telephone and get current ordering and price information.  They
tend to want payment in advance, except for ANSI members.  ANSI
standards that have been approved as Federal Info Processing Standards
(FIPS) are often available to government activities through NBS, I
think, and that route might be faster and cheaper.

If I recall, X3.64 is now under revision, partially to move it closer to
an international standard that used it as a starting point and got
ahead.  So you might try to get the name of the corresponding ISO
standard from the order department and order it as well.  The official
name of X3.64, which you may need, is "Additional Controls for Use with
American National Standard Code for Information Interchange".

ANSI standards are not, in general, available in machine readable form.
While most of the technical committees developing the things typically
have them that way, we have been trying intermittently for some years to
get a policy statement from ANSI on the release of machine-readable
copies; none has been forthcoming.

X3.64 is the responsibility of technical committee X3L2, Codes and
Character Sets.  As a last resort, the chair of that committee is Thomas

For you Little Board owners, AMPRO has a software update on the street.
Terms: Return your original distribution disc and $20.  Ask for Rev-b.
What you get:
	- CPM 2.2 with ZCPR3 installed -- essentially same as what you
have now but more so.
	- All the expected utilities, with some additions.  Unerase, Disk7,
a Termcap, and the ZCPR3 utilities--more...  Rick Conn done right.
	- New modem740.  This one doesn't gobble escape characters
like the last one did...
	- New manual in a binder to match all this.
	- a utility to read/write PCDOS files.  On first cut, can't get
mine to work -- the whole package couldn't be perfect!
	- some shell stuff.  As dyed in wool CPM, I'm not
wild about shells, but a system for Grandpa might benefit.

If you have a Little board more than a couple weeks old, this
is worth it.

Disclaimer: I own (and like) a Little Board.  b

Message-ID: <[MIT-MC.ARPA].634256.850905.GRUPP>

Because of all the recent scare of "arf arf", "trojan horse", and "worm"
programs, I offer a secure environment to look at untested software in.
This program is offered in SOURCE only so YOU can see what it does.
Via FTP from SIMTEL20;

Filename			Type	 Bytes	 CRC

Directory MICRO:<CPM.DSKUTL>
READONLY.LBR.1			BINARY	  3072  DFA9H

From the doc file;

... This program will set the disk system in a CP/M Version 2.x
operating system to read/only.  Once this program is executed the
only way to return the disk system to read/write is to do a system
reset (cold boot).  This "safety" is intended to prevent untested
software from changing any data on any disk.  This is useful even
if you know the software under test needs to write to the disk as
you can view the signon, menu, and any prompts until it does try to
write to the disk.  For example, if one of the menu options is to
display a directory, you can suspect that something is wrong if
this option tries to write to instead of read from the disk.  If
(and if when) a program does try to write to the disk a Bdos R/O
error message will be displayed and the program under test aborted.
...
    A more attractive test environment may be achieved with the use
of a ram drive that has a program to "install" itself.  If the
READONLY program is executed before the ram drive install program,
then the ram drive will remain read/write while all the other disk
drives in the system will be read/only protected.  This would allow
programs to write to the ram disk for testing, still protecting
data on the rest of the disks in the system.
...

Live long and prosper \\//

Steve,
One of the SIGM volumes has that (or maybe it took two?).  Sorry, no
direct pointers - misplaced my SIGM catalog somewhere in this mess.
SIMTEL20 has it as I recall.  I'll get you better pointers to
the SIGM catalog and specific volume if no one else can help.

Subject:  Intel vs Digital Research Linkers

	I have the Computer Innovations C86 compiler and the Intel Fortran
compiler on a machine running CPM86. My problem is that the C86 compiler
produces object modules for the Digital Research Linker and the Fortran
compiler produces object modules for the Intel linker. The Intel linker
came with the Fortran compiler, but the C86 compiler did not come with
a linker (I didn't expect it to). Now I would like to link C86 programs
with Fortran subroutines. It seems that what I need is some sort of
translator to create Intel-type object modules from Digital Research object
modules. Does such an animal exist?? If so, where might I get it??

	I realize that I can just go out and buy the Digital Research linker,
but that would still leave me with incompatible object modules.

	Another possibility would be a translator from the C86 object modules
to the Intel format object modules. The C86 compiler produces its own variety
of object module, which is then translated to the Digital Research format.

					Thanks,
					John

One of the nice things about ZCPR3 is that it leaves the command name
in the EXTFCB address. I suspect the information in a vanilla system
is stored somewhere in the CCP. (Try looking at the first page) most
of the buffers are up there.

Actually, while I have never had an occasion to try the experiment, it
looks from the manual as if the DRI linker (LINK86) is able to handle
both DRI and (at least some) Intel formats.

If not, is there any alternative to DR's CP/NET for CP/M 2.2?

Thanks...

    Re:   How to defeat a read-only filesystem

    While I haven't yet looked at your program that sets a hard disk file
    system to read-only status, it seems that its function could be defeated
    by Trojan Horse programs that do a disk reset prior to doing their
    dirty work.  

NOT true!  This program REMOVES some of the BIOS write code, so unless
the "trojan horse" knew what bios you had and what address it was
running at, could not replace it.  The ONLY thing that will restore
your os to R/W is a COLD boot, not even a warm boot as this only
restores the Bdos and CCP.

    As the military does, the only true security is physical separation.

True, but with source to your os and some patches you can do almost as well.
My system allows me to trap any given track(s) and A) abort B) allow to
proceed C) devert to log file.  Of course this is of no help if it is
a multi-user system and someone else gets in to do the dammage.

If anyone after reading the DOC and ASM file thinks there are holes
in this program, I would love to hear from you.  Most of the replies
I've gotten so far are from people that didn't look at the files and
jumped to conclusions about what this program does.  There ARE more
elegant ways of creating protection, but none SO simple and also not
possible to create a generic version that would run on ALL 2.x
systems.  This program was created for all those people that don't
have source to their os, or that may not be able to patch it themself
if they did.

This is great.  I've seen (and passed by a lot more) a lot of bellyaching
on the net about the subject.  Those who say it can't be done need to
stay the hell out of the way of those who are doing it.
Keep up the good work, Paul.

ZCPR3 is on the Apple II, if you are interested.  You can contact Z-Node
Central for a copy of the installation.  This is an electronic bulletin
board.  Number: 415-489-9005.  I'm not sure WHAT Apple II the installation
is for.  You can leave a message and ask if you have more questions.

I have been doing some work for a friend who bought a NEC 8001 (?) cpm
system second hand, complete with software and no manuals.  I've been using
the LYNC terminal program to talk to Unix VAxen, but really need some file
transfer (and wholly functional terminal emulation) capabilities.  Could
someone out there help me with lync information?  I've banged on control
keys till my fingers are numb, but haven't discovered how to get through to
any configuration/file transfer menu's.  Right now, I don't even know what
it's trying to emulate !!!! Even the address of whoever sells lync would be
a huge help.

				THANKS !!!!

Having a portable computer with a direct-connect internal modem is really
great - until you try to use it at a pay phone in the airport.  The modular
jack does not connect to public telephones.

I found one device that overcomes this problem (and it needs to be advertized
more).  It is the acoustic adapter that 3M sells with their WhisperWriter
portable terminals.

	Model 1490 acoustic coupler connects the 3M teleprinter to
	public phone lines through a telephone handset.  It is
	recommended for applications where direct connection to
	phone lines is either nott practical or not desirable.

The device consists of a pair of rubber cups, a modular jack, and a battery
powerred audio amplifier set.  You simply run a 3-foot modular line from it
to your PC, and put the pay telephone's handset in it.  Price is less than
$80, it works with 300 and 1200 baud internal modems, and should work at 2400.

In the Silcon Valley, the distributer is 3M Data Systems (408)866-8811.

Yes, its called a Z80 and you can get one from Toshiba. Look in the
latest EDN or Elect. Design. Some other japanese company is supposed to 
have a 4MHZ version out too. Also I believe Nat'l NSC-800 is cmos but 
don't know if it is pin compatible.

* New with this update

The overlay file on the left is the prefered version for the various MDM7
overlays.  Usually the difference means the the SET command is active and
will allow for changing the Baud rate from the modem program and not have
to use an external 'SETUP' programs.

Be sure that when you use DDT to overlay the proper HEX file on the various
MDM7xx.COM programs that you SAVE the proper amount of Memory to the .COM
file.  As MDM7xx has grown the SAVE size has also increased, so don't use
the SAVE size in the overlay unless you are using it on the the identified
MDM7xx program.  Best bet is to use MLOAD.COM and not worry about how much
to save.     
                    Good luck with your overlay..

If there are any NEW computer or S-100 board MDM7xx overlays not on this
list please upload them to Dave Crane's RCP/M (214-931-8274) or to the
Technical CBBS (313-846-6127) for inclusion in this list or contact me
on my up and down Lost Island RCP/M-RBBS at (214-681-4789  300/1200)
Best time is 8am to 5pm and catch as you can from 5pm to 11pm CST.

I am having a problem with one of my diskette drives, a Teac SSDD drive
on my VT180 (Robin).  Running CP/M, and trying to type a file on a
diskette in the drive, it seeks to the directory fine, then starts
typing the file, but when it is time to advance to track 1 it doesn't --
it appears locked.  It makes clicking noises without advancing until
CP/M gives up and gives me a BDOS error.  I hope its a simple adjustment
(I've used the drives for a couple of years without touching them) but
can someone tell me what?  Reply directly to Bakin -at mit-multics.arpa

INCORRECT!   The unit from Radio Shack is *NOT* controlled by an RS232
port!  The unit connects to the  Color Computer's CASSETTE TAPE interface,
and there is *NO* documentation on how the CoCo communicates with
the box.  Th link is bi-directional, meaning the controller box
can download it's contents to the CoCo for updating, and once
finished, the CoCo uploads the updated information back into the
controller.  Once the controller has been programmed with events
it may be disconncted from the CoCo and runs by itself.  I recently
purchased one of these, and while the software supplied with it
(in CoCo ROMPack form) is cute (graphic oriented), it's tedious and
slow to use.  If anyone out there has **ANY** information on how
this beastie communicates with the  CoCo, I'd really appreciate
hearing from you.

Sorry, I checked this out this weekend when the Radio-Shack box went on
sale.  It interfaces to the Color computer through the cassette
interface.  It undoubtably could be made to work with other computers, but
it would not be a trivial task.

Zilog now has a CMOS Z-80 pin and function compatable. It is

respectively.  Icc is 25mA @ 4 Mhz and 10uA @ DC.. Quite a

I don't know that much on the mm-103 but I do know the horizon.
The boot prom is addressed at e800 and takes 1k only.  There is
a prom set floating around that is addressed at fc00 - i'm sure a
request to the net for on would bring a response.  With phathomed
RAM, and the latest copy of northstar cp/m, a 60k system is possible.
(If you want more details - ask.)  with the fc00 prom one can get a
63k system.

I am seeking information and schematics on the Seattle Computer Products
SCP-16K Static RAM Board. I already know about how to address it, but would
like more info on the "bank" switches and the jumper at location V, also.

I am also looking for an explanation of what the jumpers on the Imsai SIO board
do. I would love to upgrade my speed on ser port a to 9600 baud +, and info on
the ser port b would be verrry handy indeed, for modem uses.

Further, I can't seem to get a program that will work on a PMMI MM-103. Any 
help on what the DIP switches on it do, and how to configure, for example,
MDM7, would be handy. I would love a chance to get a program that works on
a system using the SS NorthStar floppy drive system. I would be more than
willing to discuss buying/sending out a floppy to get the info copied onto.
Also, any suggestions on how to expand my CP/M to handle 52 to 56K. I seem
to be able to go to 52K, but I am not sure if the 56K interferes with the PMMI.
Expanding to 60K seems impossible, as the N* Disk controller starts at E000,
going through at least E900. Any ideas out there?

Heathkit sells the 'official' RS-232 BSR controller (feed at 110-2400 baud)
for $99.95.  They apparently include driver software for CP/M.

Subject: XMODEM version 11.7 now available

The latest version of XMODEM is now available from SIMTEL20 as:

Filename                        Type     Bytes   CRC

Directory MICRO:<CPM.RCPM>
XMDM117.LBR.1                   BINARY  102656  24A5H

XMODEM is a program which runs on a RCPM system to allow a remote user
to transfer files to or from it.

Updates and revisions (in reverse order)

v11.7 09/08/85 - Added patch so MBBS used to enter upload descriptions
into message file. (MBYE40 and MBBS40 needed for this.)  Also added
Murray Simsolo's XMDM116.FIX and a variation of Mark Motley's fix to
clear the WRTLOC flag when the "help" message is displayed so the user
can abort it and his TOSEXIT equate to make the TOS display on exit an
option.. Also fixed so that instead of time on system being reset, max
time allowed on is adjusted instead if a user uploads a file. Added
LOGSYS equate to pick the old LOG.SYS filename as new MBBS will work
with XMODEM.LOG as well as LOG.SYS now.. Added DWNTAG option so files
tagged with "F3" status attribute can be downloaded regardless of
access privileges. Fixed bugs introduced into v11.6 by Paul Trania (he
eliminated needed WRTLOC clear in DESCRIB optional code). NOTE: Read
MURPHY'S LAWS re: computer program bug fixes. (IF NOT TURKEY)
(Although I didn't like all of Steve's "fixes", I was trying to
integrate his updates with John Hoffman.  The old NOT X and NOT Y
might have been more confusing than NOT (X or Y) but either works...
But (NOT X or Y) is NOT the same thing.. Changed OK2400 comments to
reflect change in code by pst..) Added code so ^X, pause, ^X will
abort an upload. -- Kim Levitt

v11.6 - 08/11/85 - Fixed bugs introduced between 112 and 115. Added
Kevin Murphy's changes to allow BYEBDOS systems to gain time on system
(note: must be using BYE338 for this to work properly.  If you're
running BYE337, please upgrade to v338, as v338 corresponds to the
documentation and changes the way one BYEBDOS call function works).
-- pst

v11.5 - 08/10-85 - Fixed a bug in the "turkey patch" that could cause
double entries in the log file for uploads or worse. Also, eliminated
"thru packet " in message to console that is unnecessary and was
leaving last packet number on console screen at end of downloads if a
file is sent which requires small packets at the end. Also I fixed the
version number. (this is #11.5 not 1.15 or 115) Incorporated code from
John Hoffman's 11.3 update and Steve Sanders' 11.4 update to bring out
one version with all bugs fixed and features together again (I hope).
Made some of Steve's feature patches optional. (DSPFNAM for display
file name option, MBYE37 equate renamed to MBYETOS.)  --Kim Levitt

v11.4 - 08/10/85 - Steve Sanders' version. (Did not include v11.3
updates.)  LUXMOD equate added so XMODEM can be configured to work as
a LUXMODEM program. XM-FNAM2.ADD patch added to display selected file
name on downloads and uploads so user can verify system didn't get
garbage for the filename. Fixed TAGLBR option to work correctly.
Misc. clean up and changes.  -- Steve Sanders

More history is available in XMDM117.UPD which is incide the LBR.

Kevin, the MM103 modem cannot be used at the usual port C0h when used
with a Horizon.  Reason: the mother board uses that address for other
purposes, usually for RAM parity control.  Most people change the
MM103 to port D0h or B0h.

There are overlays for MEX and MODM700 for using the PMMI.  They are
complete with dialing routines.

Mike, et al,

I have a little program, DBLPRINT.COM (and accompanying DBLPRINT.HLP)
that works just fine on a CP/M 2.2 system.  Cannot remember just where I
found it - doesn't seem to be in the SIGM archives (didn't see it anyway),
but fur shur is Public Domain.

I do NOT have source code, so no mods possible (very easily).  Glad to upload
it to where you can reach it if you like.  If they're doing Apples or PC's,
tho, we're out of luck with this program.

Thanks for the info, my documentation is more than a little confusing on
the DIP settings. Mine are arranged as in the following illus.:

		1 2 3 4 5 6 
		o o o O O O
		- - - - - -
		O O O o o o
		---OPEN----

where O is down, o is up.

I assume that this is the address E000. Am I right?
Also, are you aware of any schematics for the auxilary interface for this?
I'm interested in trying out a scheme for power-up on phone ring, answer.
This would be for a small remote system I have in mind, otherwise I would
just leave it running 24hrs/day, or so.

The exact details are available from the CoCo "Service Manual" (the little
green book) at most RS stores.  Unfortunately, the Cassete port is just
an "analogue switch",  The usual format is KC-1200 format.
   |<1>|<-0->|
    _   __      
___| | |  |  |       (the logical 1,0 may be opposite)
     |_|  |__| 

If regular BASIC cassette I/O commands work or there examples of it
in the owners manual, then this will work.  A line reciever can be
built using an op-amp.

They may have used the Cassette Port because of certain hardware advantages.
(Basic can't write to the RS-232 port,only "Dload")

If they wrote their own interface in ML, it's anybody's guess.

Assuming you have access to CPM/[MS|PC]DOS machines, the current versions
of Wordstar(tm) support a "column move" capability.  Not very convenient,
but it can be made to work.

1:	Format the text to the width of a column.
2:	Change to Column move mode -- ^K^N
3:	mark the top left corner of the text that is to go in the second
	column.		^K^B
4:	mark the bottom right corner of the '2nd' column text.	^K^K
	(The block of text should now be highlighted (or have ^B down
	the left and ^K down the right, depending on your hardware.)
5:	place the cursor at the top left corner of the 2nd column
	destination area
6:	execute the move	^K^V

7:	delete the blank lines left in the source area.

8:	repeat steps 3..7 as needed for additional columns.
9:	Save your stuff regularly.  This procedure crashes WS with some
	regularity on my Kaypro (WS Ver 3.something); problem may be
	resolved if later releases are out.
10:	DO NOT USE JUSTIFIED PRINTING IF YOUR PRINTER ATTEMPTS TO
	MICRO-JUSTIFY THE LINES.

Off hand, the only other solution (inexpensive!) might be to find
a second hand dedicated word processor someone might be willing to
donate.  (I know Phillips Micom 2000's supportted automatic
multicolumn formatting, and XEROX 860s are (were) supposed to but
I never used it there.  The other 10-15 dedicated wp's I used to
have access to couldn't do it.)

I'm not familiar with any of the other WP programs in the cpm/ms/pcdos
area.  I never found any of them to have enough improvement, if any,
over WS to be worth the cost/effort to learn another.

In the UN*X area, Fortune's FORTUNE:WORD (tm) has auto multicolumn
capability, but from what you indicated, it would be too expensive,
unless you could get a donation.
PS:	the ^K^B^N stuff is <CTRL>k , etc. in case your not familiar
	with this notation.

This is a MEX overlay for the Heath H89 with either 8250 or 2661-3
UART.  It has an expanded SET command to set parity, stopbits and word
length.  If you use a smartmodem it also sets ANSWER/ORIGINATE mode,
TONE/PULSE, and delay until "hangup" (0-30 seconds).  It will SET baud
rates from 300 to 9600.

My father wants to join the net, but only has a CP/M box (he has MS-DOS
too, but that is a piddling machine).  Anyway, I would like a pointer to
the source for uucp for cp/m.  Thanks in advance.

At one time you could get "baby blue" an add on board with a Z80 on it 
that would run CP/M programs directly.

Huh? I used to be at a BITNET site (U of Chicago), and BITNET is pretty
much a home-rolled network based on IBM's NJE (Network Job Entry)
protocol, which VM/370 supports with a product called RSCS. Administration
is out of (I think) Columbia. Each site supplies a 9600 baud dedicated
to the nearest node already on the network and in turn agrees to allow
at least one other site to link to them. It is, in fact, a store and
forward system.You can, however, shuttle interactive commands around
the network, so TSO and CMS users can interactively talk to each other
(though it can be S L O W . . .).

There are at least 500 sites on BITNET, I think more. It is limited to
educational institutions. The name Ira Fuchs comes to me as the network
originator and administrator.

OK, I've tried to get Z8E running on my machine (I mean I'm real tired of DDT),
but the developers of Z8E forgot one thing:  Z80s have something called
interrupt mode 1.  This is the quick and dirty interrupt mode which causes
a jump to 38H.  Z8E (and unpatched versions of DDT) use restart 7 (which
also jumps to 38H) as the breakpoint mechanism, which on my system (and 
presumably others, since Digital Research issued a patch for DDT to use a 
different restart vector) is the address of the interrupt handler.  No good.

I tried to change which restart vector it uses in the source, but there aren't
any wonderful equates at the front of the source that would make this easy, so
I had to go digging.  I may have gotten them all, after a single pass through
the source, but somehow I doubt it, as the program now crashes after I ask
it to disassemble four instructions.  Real useful.   HELP!

Question: UUCP for cp/m?

UUCP is the "Unix-to-Unix copy" utility, if I remember correctly....is what
you want a file transfering program....a file transfer program that uses
the same protocol as UUCP (be that xmodem or whatever...I don't rightly
know....)....what exactly are you looking for?

NetLandians,

In my new meanderings amongst the wonders of MS-DOS, I've discovered
a BUNCH of text files do NOT end with CTRL-Z, and lo and behold, so did
my little Stripper program (peel out hi bits from WS and other files,
tabify but NOT indiscriminately at every 8th column, strip trailing spaces,
etc.).  Good old Stripper 1.1 chokes and dies every time!

So ... Stripper V1.2, which works from the physical size of the file as
well as checking for potential CTRL-Z's is now lying in my directory,
ABN.ISCAMS, at my host USC-ISIB, available for Anonymous FTP.  File
name STRIP12.PAS, 7-bit, Turbo Pascal source.

This should replace the version 1.1 at SIMTEL20 and MARKET aka LCG.KERMIT at

Due to CP/M's many limitations, from filesystem to memory to everything
else, your best bet for CP/M electronic mail is to use KERMIT to gateway
messages to and from a cooperating host.  This has already been
accomplished by several persons.  KERMIT is small, very understandable,
well documented, and freely available without licensing complexities.

The Software Toolworks  (818)-986-4885
14478 Glorietta Drive, Sherman Oaks, CA 91403.

Currently sells "ZP/EM", which does a software emulation of a Z80.
I have seen it run accounting programs written in CBASIC without change.
Emulation speed is roughly that of a 1 MHz machine (on a stock 4.77 MHz PC).
Comes with terminal emulation for a variety of terminals.

ZP/EM                   39.95
Media Master Plus       59.95   (includes ZP/EM)

"Media Master Plus" comes with a copy of Media Master (for
reading foreign 5-1/4 inch soft-sector diskettes).

They are about to release a similar package which will incorporate a V20
chip (and will run much faster). Price not yet available.

One way that I have found to test programs whos nature is untrusted is the
following:
	On my cp/m 80 system, I run a copy of a special version of my CP/M 3
that knows only about the floppy disks. The worst that can happen is it trashes
the floppies and I have to diskdup them again.

	On my MS-DOS XT, My hard disk is formatted for MS-DOS 3.0.  When I
boot of off a MS-DOS 2.1 floppy it doesn't reconize my harddisk and won't
work with it.  But I also run a vdisk from 3.0 that sets up C: to be a 
340k floppy and my autoexec.bat copies all of my standard tools to the C:vdisk.
	I can then open the A: drive and now there are no real disks left
available on this "virtual system".

THERE MOST CERTAINLY IS A PROGRAM FOR THIS! 

IT IS CALLED "MEDIA MASTER PLUS" AND COSTS $59.95. IT INCLUDES MEDIA
MASTER WHICH READS, WRITES, AND FORMATS OVER 70 DIFFERENT DISKS; AND
ALSO INCLUDES "ZP/EM" WHICH EMULATES CP/M 2.2 ON IBM PC'S AT ABOUT
1-2 MHZ(WON'T RUN HARDWARE DEPENDENT PROGRAMS,E.G. GRAPHICS KEY-
BOARD ENHANCERS).

IT IS AVAILABLE FROM:  INTERSECTING CONCEPTS
                       4573 HEATHERGLEN CT.
                       MOORPARK, CA. 93021

                       ALS 1-800-824-7888 (OPERATOR 251)

I HAVE NO CONNECTION WITH INTERSECTING CONCEPTS BUT CAN RECOMMEND THE 
PROGRAM SINCE I USE IT ON MY OSBORNE ONE TO TRANSFER TEXT AND DATA 
FILES TO IBM PC AT WORK.

I am posting this query for a friend who is going into practice as a
doctor. He wants to know about programs that will allow him to keep
track of patients' visits, history (condition/therapy/results) and
billing. Any other capabilities would be a plus. He wants something that
will do the job out of the box (no 1-2-3 or DBase-II) since he is new to
computers, and for the same reason it must be very user-friendly. It can
run on any machine, since he doesn't own a computer yet and will
probably make his hardware choice based on his choice of software. I
have already told him that for that kind of application he MUST have a
hard disk, otherwise I guess it's pretty wide open: CP/M, MS-DOS,
Apple-II, Mac... 

How is that for a wish list? Any info on capabilities, required
hardware, publisher, price will be appreciated. Reply to me, I will
summarize and repost if there is enough interest.

I saw an ad over here for HSC co-processor boards, which add a 8086 or
68000 with 256k-2.5M onto a Z80. Basically the Z80 chi sits on  an
interface board which does all the neat stuff to allow CP/M68K to use the
Z80's disk, keyboard, screen etc, and the Z80 to use the extra RAM as a
RAM-DISK. (CP/M68K is the default O/S).

Can anyone give me any impressions about these things? Are they value for
money? (and what are you paying for them - for us its about US$1000).
Are there better ways to get a good CPU without junking perfectly good
terminals/disk-drives? (Gimme Amiga!)

Also, can anyone give me a name of a supplier, or the address of
HSC itself (they are NY based, I think).

Please mail replies, I'll summarise if there's interest

Many Thanks,

I thought this was going to be easy, but ....

I'm trying to buy a copy of TurboPascal v3.0 for my NorthStar 
Horizon running CP/M-80 v2.2.  So far I've gone through about 10 
mail order places in BYTE and come up empty - most don't carry 
it, and the two that I found that do, don't have it in stock.

So, anyone know a source where I can buy and get a copy 
relatively quickly, say, under two weeks?  Some of the places 
having only the IBM versions advertize prices as low as $30 ... 
I'll settle for anything under $50.

Please reply directly to rbloom@apg-1 *AND* rbloom@brl-vld (apg-1 
shuts down weekends.)  

(I need the Pascal compiler for a course I'm taking and am 
already two weeks behind in assignments - the code's written but 
I have nothing to compiler it on.  Yes I know there's JRT, but 
was told that it can be worse than useless ...)

I found a company that makes such a board. They imply that

It's Scitronics in Bethlehem PA.

I called them for a catalog and price quote. $250 !! (chock and puke).
Ah well, the catalog will make a nice addition to the wallpaper

Bob (et al)

You wanted to order Turbo Pascal 3.0 FAST .. just placed a telephonic order
(at 9:30 PM!) to NorthEastern .. ad in PCWeek, tollfree (!) 1-800-382-2242.
Good prices, and came in this afternoon via UPS .. 2 day (less, actually)
response time.  7 days a week ordering, air courier delivery even!

I have no affiliation or commercial/financial kickback from this .. just a
pleased "fast-response-needed" customer.

Turbo 3.0 was $37, Turbo ToolBox 1.0 $29.00 (if you want database/BTree
stuff).  They also have rental library for short-term stuff.

Your best bet for a micro implementation of UUCP is Lauren Weinstein's
(sp?) package.  Contact lauren@vortex for more info.

As I recall, he did a complete ground-up implementation without
looking at any UUCP source.  The protocols are not described anywhere
and are therefore considered "trade secret" (no flames if I used the
wrong legalese, please); he spent a lot of time sitting there typing
stuff at a uucico to figure out what's going on...

Good suggestion, but no banana ...

Just talked with NorthEastern - and was told that they only sold
software for IBM compatibles.  They is the same stuff that I've gotten
from a whole bunch of places, I guess that the CP/M-80 market is
dying.

If I can't find somebody with it in stock, I gues that I'll have to 
go directly to Borland; but $70 seems a bit steep when places like

I normally wouldn't reply directly to this group about this,
but I wanted to make a clarification in response to a number
of queries which appear to have been misdirected to this and other groups.

My rather comprehensive uucp/mail (uucp/822/domains)/basic netnews, etc.
package (UULINK) has indeed started limited distribution.
It is for MSDOS; I was able (with a LOT of work) to get the package to
run in 256K and within the framework of the MSDOS OS and filesystem.  
The combined object code of the various programs of the package come
close to filling up a standard MSDOS floppy.  The package is not for CP/M.

only problem is that they came without manuals.  If anyone has copies of these

Have you contacted Borland itself? If it is available, they should have
it. Another solution would be to get yourself a format conversion
program like Uniform or Media Master so you can order Turbo in another
format (it is user-installable so you'll be fine). Or you can go to a
local computer club for the format conversion, they will be glad to help
with a conversion program or an Xmodem transfer

Good luck

Subject: APPLE KERMIT- CPM VERSION

FROM: Trevor,

I am loking for information on the Kermit-80 version available for the Apple
II series.  It will not connect to my host; it does'nt even send a transmit-
ting character over the line.  I have heard that some people have had problems
with their Microsoft cards only working in slots 4 or 5.  Could someone elab-
orate on this?  I am not using a Microsoft card; I'm using an Applied Engin-
eering Z80+ card with their CPAM 4.1 software.

I would move my card, but all the other slots are full and already configured
for other products/packages.  Please forward comments, advice, etc. to me at
this address.


Thanks.

Sorry, we don't have any spare manuals for the VT1xx Terminals,
but we know that the most important escape sequence for the
VT 100 is:
            <ESC>[145q
                 i------- left square bracket
But you will find it in none of the manuals.

As far as I know, no one has written an overlay for cp/m kermit (cp4...)
for the Applicard CP/M.  You cannot use the microsoft overlays since
the way you communicate with the serial is different between the two
systems... For what its worth - I'm currently working on this (I've
got an Applicard at home - Microsoft at work).  I'll pass it along
when I'm finished.

THE SYSTEM WAS TO RUN AS THE BULLETIN BOARD SOURCE FOR THE OKOK(OSBORNE

LOST.

IF SOMEONE HAS DOCUMENTATION AVAILABLE FOR THIS UNIT WE WOULD BE VERY
GRATEFUL FOR A COPY, I.E. WE WILL PAY FOR IT. BARING THIS, WE WOULD

FINALLY, IF NONE OF THIS IS POSSIBLE THE CLUB WOULD LIKE TO SELL THE

But does Media Master plus let you, say, take your Osborne 1 WordStar or
dBase II and run it on an IBM PC?  If so, how does it handle the 
differences in terminal characteristics (clear screen, highlighting,
etc.).  I've been using plain old Media Master (no plus) for well
over a year know to do data transfers and find it wonderful for
that.

Jack - I really agree with you and have raised the issue with Dave Towson
(the super-helpful administrator of info-cpm).  

The bottom line is this:  virtually all of these advertisements are coming
from the USENET side of the internet, not the ARPA/MILNET side.  It appears
that not only does usenet approve of this activity, but they even have a
specialized distribution list just for selling stuff.  I applaud the 
restraint of the ARPA/MILNET users have shown in not abusing the net with
advertisements of their own.  (I would really hate to see "our" side of the
net affected by some whistle-blower complaining about the mis-use of 
DoD facilites, etc.)  

They only way to stop these messages would be to drop the gateway between
USENET and ARPA/MILNET.  I, for one, feel that the help and information
I receive from our USENET friends is worth the trouble of the for sale
notes.  My opinion is based on seeing only a few for sale notes every
week; if we really started getting a bunch of them, then I might have
to rethink my stand.

One possible approach is that if USENET has a specialized distribution
list just for advertisements, then they somehow try to insure that all
adverts appear just on that list and not on info-cpm or any of the
other lists.

Anyone else have an opinion on the subject?

Subject:  Re:  want ads in mailing lists

I agree with Jeff, but I think the 'for sale' traffic is far less than
2 or 3 a week.  Or maybe I unconciously skip over them, so their
frequency is not a memorable number.  At any rate, it has not been
bothersome to me, but we do have to be careful about misuse.

But those are "personal" for sales.  What about Gov't agencies or Gov't
contractors?  Does the reg prohibit, say, NASA advertising that it has
an excess VAX that can be picked up by any other Gov't agency for the
cost of packing and shipping (as is done by USnail with the Defense
Automation Resources Information Center's Excess Automation Equipment
BULLETIN)?

This program might be of special interest to those people interested
in the social impacts of microcomputing, desktop computerization, and
home computing.  Current reserach projects within this program examine
the social dimensions of these technologies: who uses them in the
larger society, what they are good for, how people and organizations
integrate them into their daily lives.

========================================================================
                                CORPS

                               -------

                        Graduate Education in

            Computing, Organizations, Policy, and Society

               at the University of California, Irvine


     This graduate concentration at the University of California,
Irvine provides an opportunity for scholars and students to
investigate the social dimensions of computerization in a setting
which supports reflective and sustained inquiry.

     The primary educational opportunities are PhD concentrations in
the Department of Information and Computer Science (ICS) and MS and
PhD concentrations in the Graduate School of Management (GSM).
Students in each concentration can specialize in studying the social
dimensions of computing.

     The faculty at Irvine have been active in this area, with many
interdisciplinary projects, since the early 1970's.  The faculty and
students in the CORPS have approached them with methods drawn from the
social sciences.

     The CORPS concentration focuses upon four related areas of
inquiry:

 1.  Examining the social consequences of different kinds of
     computerization on social life in organizations and in the larger
     society.

 2.  Examining the social dimensions of the work and organizational
     worlds in which computer technologies are developed, marketed,
     disseminated, deployed, and sustained.

 3.  Evaluating the effectiveness of strategies for managing the
     deployment and use of computer-based technologies.

 4.  Evaluating and proposing public policies which facilitate the
     development and use of computing in pro-social ways.


     Studies of these questions have focussed on complex information
systems, computer-based modelling, decision-support systems, the
myriad forms of office automation, electronic funds transfer systems,
expert systems, instructional computing, personal computers, automated
command and control systems, and computing at home.  The questions
vary from study to study.  They have included questions about the
effectiveness of these technologies, effective ways to manage them,
the social choices that they open or close off, the kind of social and
cultural life that develops around them, their political consequences,
and their social carrying costs.

     CORPS studies at Irvine have a distinctive orientation -

(i) in focussing on both public and private sectors,

(ii) in examining computerization in public life as well as within
      organizations,

(iii) by examining advanced and common computer-based technologies "in
      vivo" in ordinary settings, and

(iv) by employing analytical methods drawn from the social sciences.



         Organizational Arrangements and Admissions for CORPS


     The CORPS concentration is a special track within the normal
graduate degree programs of ICS and GSM.  Admission requirements for
this concentration are the same as for students who apply for a PhD in
ICS or an MS or PhD in GSM.  Students with varying backgrounds are
encouraged to apply for the PhD programs if they show strong research
promise.

     The seven primary faculty in the CORPS concentration hold
appointments in the Department of Information and Computer Science and
the Graduate School of Management.  Additional faculty in the School
of Social Sciences, and the program on Social Ecology, have
collaborated in research or have taught key courses for CORPS
students.  Our research is administered through an interdisciplinary
research institute at UCI which is part of the Graduate Division, the
Public Policy Research Organization.

Subject: Some S-100 questions?
Cc: Info-CPM@AMSAA.ARPA, crash!kevinb@SDCSVAX.ARPA, BUDDENBERGRA@USC-ISI.ARPA

  A while ago I ran off a big helplist to help get my IMSAI 8080
system going, and, I am glad to say, recieved a great deal of help.
Now, I have run into a few more problems with this system, and thought I'd
toss them out to see if there are any geniuses out there able to answer my
puzzling questions. These are as follows:

My system runs fine at 4 Mhz sans NorthStar MDC-A4 Disk Controller. Getting
4 out of this beast would be nice. Anybody with information on a possible
speedup of this board? Rumor has it there are some jumperable options of that
nature, and any info on this board would be wonderful....

Does anybody know of ANY modification sheets for the IMSAI frontpanel around?
I would dearly love to have it start up in "Run mode", but have no idea at this
moment as to how to do that. ANY information on mods, whether applicable or 
not, would be handy indeed.

Does anybody have documentation on the Seattle Computer Product's line of S-100
boards? S.C.P. is now dealing in IBM stuff, and their archives went up in their
company's fire last December, worse luck. I am specifically asking for the
SCP-16K 16 K Plus, a 16K static RAM board, but am looking toward also 
forwarding any info received to them to regenerate their archives with.


Also, does anyone know of the fate of a software company known as Dvorak's
Software Review? A friend has a patch for his NorthStar from this company that
may work on my system, but is unaware of whether they are still in biz, or what
the status is of software bought from a defunct company. Is it then Public
Domain? I'm scratching my head on this one, myself.

And finally, anybody know what happened to IMS Associates, Inc. (IMSAI)?
I heard the co. died, but that another company named (Fisher-Freitas?) was
helping out and providing support. Heard they may be gone now, too.
I am still in the process of getting things together, but right now it seems
to be finally running, though I am not sure of all the things making it go,
the Imsai SIO board, for example.

As always, any information on anything S-100 is welcome, as are requests for 
documentation on anything I got.  Donations of cards are exceedingly welcome,
and I have (surprise!) already gotten my first, an IMSAI MPU-A from Brian
Kantor of San Diego. If you have any S-100 stuff that is just mouldering away,
try donating to me instead, especially in the San Diego and LA area. I will
be more than happy to take that ol' stuff and try to rebuild it again, not to
mention that we have a local handicapped club that feels the same way about
any computer equipment. Let me know, anything would be handy.


			Thanks for hearing me out,

Subject: Ads and other things

I, too, would like to have the ads in a special list, like info-cpm-ad,

so I just can summarily discard them from my readerlist. ( Pardon my

language, they only gave me an account on the IBM )

I guess there are a lot of people still wanting them, though.



I would like to have the whole info-cpm in a digested form like

info-ibmpc or info-kermit, anyway.



This would be a lot easier to handle. Can't one automate the thing

like bundling 10 messages and then distribute them ?



( Again, fighting VM/SP over a 1200 baud line ain't fun !

Once in a while I can get a 4800 baud line, but I am spoiled by

VAX/VMS 4.1. The local gurus tell me:  Real Soon Now ... )



By the way : Thanks to all answering my recent pleas for help.

Does anyone have code that generates a BREAK for the Osborne I?

I have tried unsuccessfully to add code to Osborne I Kermit to generate a
BREAK.  I thought since the Apple ][ CCS 7710A card uses a memory mapped
6850, that similar code should work on the Osborne I.  But of course :-) it
does not work.

Are there any Osborne Wisards out there that can help?

'course you could get it from Borland, they of course charge list for it

Earl - Excess hardware disposal is handled by GSA.  GSA is notified
by Agency X that it has ABC as excess.  GSA collects all of the 
notifications for one month and then publishes what is available, 
general condition of the hdw and who has declared it surplus.  Agency
Y contacts X and if Y decides they want it, Y contacts GSA and claims
ABC.  If no Fed Agency claims the hardware, States & munnicipals get
next shot, followed by schools, with for profits getting last chance.

Generally, if it isn't claimed by the school level, it isn't worth much.
I remember an old Honeywell mainframe that was picked-up by a little old
man.  He cut all the cables with a hacksaw and was not very gentle in the
way he was dismembering it.  When we protested, saying that it did work, but
if he continued the way he was going that it wouldn't work, his response
was that it wasn't a computer as far as he was concerned: "It is just
of gold on circuit boards and I am going after the gold".

Jeff

For AMPRO/Little Board and Ciarcia HD64180 board owners.
An undocumented feature that I discovered is that the
5 1/4 disc formats are identical for both machines.

Now what engineer in his right mind would have made that
unforgivable error?  Must be a bug...

Harold,

You queried about a PD program to translate from ASM (I assume Intel) source
code to Zilog mnemonics.

Yep, XLATE2.COM and .MAC, available on SIGM Volume 91.  I use it (plus a
stronger version from the UK) all the time.  Available via ANONYMOUS
logon at SIMTEL20 in the MICRO: (aka PD:) archives.

Works just fine.

to do with the same person doing the BIOS (in this case, Joe Wright).
The government is aware of this problem and is planning to budget $1M for
a study to decide what to do about it.

I can really vouch for it.  I do all development on my main system,
use T3MASTER/T3SERVER to transfer files to the Ampro, and then litterally
put the Ampro disk on the SB180 and read/use it.  Works like a charm.

You were told correctly. Some time ago when I worked for UCLA Extension
we bought JRT Pascal compiler for CPM2.2 on hp125. It stunk. Turbo Pascal
was WAY better.  However, JRT had a new version of their compiler since
then. ...

As an alternative: have you tried to call the folks at Borland?
They are the ones who make it. The could suggest a dealer to contact!
