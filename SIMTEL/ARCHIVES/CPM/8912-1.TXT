I seem to recall, a long time ago, advertised in Byte magazine, a group of
compilers called Nevada (i.e. Nevada COBOL, Nevada LOGO, etc).  I tested the
LOGO compiler out for a Tarbell 56K CP/M 2.2 system and it seemed to work
pretty well.  I'm afraid I don't have any current information on them, as I
don't keep back issues of Byte, but I'm sure they can't be too hard to find.

Hope this helps.

Subject: Between DOS and CP/M

Long time ago someone asked for info on disk format conversion between
MSDOS and CP/M.

There is a program in the Simtel that can do it:  <msdos.dskutl>22dsk130.arc
(it might be lib).  I have been using it a lot and it is pretty good.  It
runs on the MS-DOS machine and has a pretty extensive list of formats it can
cover.  You can also customize it.  And - this is good - it can take ALL
sizes of floppies so long as the machine has the drive for it (of course).

That means the (former) owners of weird CP/M portables with 3-1/2 floppies
can transfer the stuff to MS-DOS and vicci-vercci.

Used to be a company called "Ellis" that sold a [very inexpensive]
COBOL for CP/M (I believe).  It may have been little more than a
toy....I don't know.  They were located in San Francisco at one
time, but then they moved to Reno (to get closer to the tables??).
They alaso sold an editor "Nevada Edit" and FORTRAN.  They may
have moved over into the MSDOS world by now.  Try looking in the
advertiser's index in Byte....old ones, and new ones.

Subject: COBOL for CP/M
Message-ID: <8912010212.AA14649@decwrl.dec.com>

With reference to Ruediger Soerensen's recent message about COBOL, I had the
same problem when I needed a COBOL for some classes I was taking.  Ellis
Computing, 3917 Noriega Street, San Francico, CA 94122 (when last heard of)
used to do a CP/M COBOL.  They now do an MSDOS COBOL, and have abandoned CP/M
completely, won't even sell it.  I got a copy of *their* compiler from England
- it was being sold on 3" (sic) disks for the Amstrad range of machines.  I
don't have an address for the seller, but there were (18 months ago) several.
 
This COBOL is the ANSI 78 version, and a bit limited.  It got me through the
course, which mostly used the more structured 85 (?) version, but I had to
leave more complex control structures out of my code.  I'm sorry, but I can't
remember the detailed differences.  It was cheap, ran on my generic CP/M
machines, and did the job.  I didn't like it, but I probably wouldn't like any
COBOL; I don't do the sort of jobs it was designed for.
 
Hope this helps - Will

To make matters worse, the seller did not have any backup disks! 

Does anyone have a boot disk I can beg, buy, borrow, or steal? It looks
like I need at least CPM3.SYS plus whatever else is needed to back it up
(format,sysgen,bot,backup,restore or whatever).

Subject: ZEX v 5.0 requirements
Message-ID: <8911301723.AA12039@newton>

ZEX v 5.0 is a Z-System tool for obtaining console input from a script
(or in-memory) file.  The input can be provided to the command
processor, an application program, or both.

Version 5.0 requires an extended external environment descriptor in
the ZCPR v.3.3 or v 3.4 system.  That data structure includes the base
addresses for the operating system segments -- BIOS, BDOS, CCP.  If
the address at (0001) does not correspond to the one in the
descriptor, you'll get the message you reported:

	'incompatible RSX changed address at (0001)'.

The auto-install versions of ZCPR 3.4 (NZ-COM for cp/m 2.2 and Z3PLUS
for CP/M 3.x) automatically provide the extended environment.  A
separate tool -- JetLDR -- is available for loading system segments in
earlier systems; it upgrades the environment descriptor when
a segment is loaded.

In a correctly installed system, that message would normally result if
some application, usually a mis-behaved RSX, had altered the contents
of 0001.  (An RSX should *always* leave 0001 unchanged.  If it needs
to intercept the warm-boot vector, it should modify the BIOS vector.
Otherwise subsequent applications cannot locate the BIOS.)

But in your case, perhaps the BIOS address didn't get set correctly when
you modified the ENV descriptor?

Further technical documentation on the Z-System can be found regularly
in issues of The Computer Journal, 190 Sullivan Crossroad, Columbia
Falls MT, 59912.

There was a review of Ellis' COBOL for CP/M in Micro-Cornucopia
back '83 or so.  I don't have the article -- I've just seen it
in their listings of back issues.  You should still be able to
get it from them.  I don't have their address or phone number.
If you need it, let me know, and I will dig out an old issue.

Wait a minute, I do have a phone number, but I don't know if its 
their BBS or their tech help line.  It's 503-382-8048.  You can 
always try it; if you get a modem, you've got the BBS.  I believe 
the hours for the tech line are just in the morning.  I called 
them twice with questions about my Kaypro 2X.  They were quite 
polite and helpful both times.  The second time, the guy I was 
talking to just lifted the top off of the Kaypro he was using so 
that he could see what I was talking about.  Kinda neat!

I have a buddy on a tight budget who is trying to fix up a Lobo
Max-80 CPM computer.  It has a THICK keyboard with all the guts
(CPU, LOGIC & MEMORY) inside and a lot of interesting connectors
on the back edge.  The model number is 1282-71.  It has four 8
inch, single sided drives (only two hooked up and working) and a
monochrome monitor.  The connectors are labeled parallel printer,
UVC Winchester, 5 inch floppy and I/O expansion.  All of these (I
think) are the kind where an edge connector would plug on to the
circuit board.  There are also two 25 pin serial port plugs (A &
B) and a phono-jack type video out connector.

We would like to add on 5.25 inch DSDD disk drives and keep at
least one of the 8 inch drives.  If the Lobo Company is still in
the business, We would like that address / phone number.

Also would like to find ready to run commumications (modem)
software in an appropriate 8 inch disk format.  (If can't get the
5.25 drive addition, will be stuck with 8 inchers.)

Please e-mail information / guesses / clues / hints to

Microcornucopia is definitely alive and well.  They don't maintain much

Hello--
  We recently came into possession of a Micro Decision 64K computer, made by
Morrow Designs,Inc.  Unfortunately, though the computer was given to us, we did
not receive any documntation or software for it.
  The computer runs on Micro Decision 64K CP/M Version 2.2 (the only disk we
received.) This was copyrighted in various years by Morrow Designs and Digital
Research, Inc. It has a 1200 baud serial port designed (judging from the label)
for either a printer or a modem.
  We would like to be able to connect this computer to a 1200 baud modem, and 
use it to connect to the university computers. Ideally, we would like to 
emulate a VT100 with it, but bggars cannot be choosers. If anybody has any
software or ideas about finding software (we are unable to develop our own due
to lack of compilers, etc.) we would be most grateful.

where I could get any such cp/m software in any format?

I had the same problem with UUCP201.LBR. Meanwhile,
 UUCP20I.LBR is available at SIMTEL20.
Trying out that (new?) version I found that the missing components
(ALL.SUB, OTHERS.SUB, CCICO.SUB and MAIL.SUB) were in place now.
Instead the docs are packed in a strange way, they are not crunched or
squeezed, but have the character 'Y' as the middle char of the file
extension ( *.DYC). What does this mean? A new reducing technique?

Many have asked for info about FTP locations for CPM software.  One site
is wsmr-simtel20.army.mil  (used to be SIMTEL20.ARPA).  Below is the
directory that I got from SIMTEL20.  Each of these is a directory.  

NOTE:  This machine is a Dec-20.  This means that binarys have to be
comverted to eightbit from , I think, 48 bit.  My FTP program has
an outomatic translator.  You may have to write a program to to it for you.

i seem to remember a request a little while back asking about a 
split screen communications program. i came across one one the 
heath-zenith sig of compuserve. its a beta test version so it has
some bugs in it. i only used it once so far but looks promising.
its written around the heath z-19 terminal but might work on other
cpm machines. its called MTMDM.COM and the split screen operation
is in conference mode. the production version is 16.95 and ill add
the name and address of the vendor below.

     There is a new compression algorithm available for CP/M machines
now.  The popular name for it seems to have become CRLZH.  This is the
same algorithm used by LHARC and PKZIP IMPLODE technique.

     Look for CRLZH11.LBR on your favorite RCP/M, or call Z-Node #9q
at 619-270-3148.  That's the author's own system, and the latest versions of the programs are available there.

Hello Ruediger,

the files with the "?Y?" extension are LZH compressed files (as ?Z? are
crunched and ?Q? are squeezed). I've got some programs to deal with these
files, if you are interested...

Yep, there's a new algorithm out there.  It's a program called
"CRLZH11" which uses the new LZH algorithm for tighter packs.  I
can mail you a copy of the uncruncher, UCRLZH11.COM, which will not
only uncrunch LZH-encoded files, they can uncrunch GEL-encoded
files (?Z?), and unsqueeze Huffman-encoded files (?Q?).  Plus I
have a file that can extract files from a library, while, at the
same time, decompress them if they are compressed.  For anyone out
there, jus give the word, and I'll post the LBR uuencoded, so you
can pipe it to uudecode.

I have already replied to you from both sites, ijsys and sactoh0.
But since you bring this up, I thought I'd make sure that you knew

This is indeed a new compression method - to uncompress it look for
CRLZH, or EXL: both of these will allow extraction of the file. .?Y?
and .?Z? are the current best methods, in 90% of cases I've tried,
.?Y? files come out smaller than the corresponding .?Z? file.

One way of getting around the 48-bit problem is to set the data length

QTERM also does split screen, and is free - just scoop it up from SIMTEL20,
or your local BBS. If you get desperate, drop me a line at the addresses

Has anyone requested the file BYE510.LBR from Simtel lately?
I have requested it about 10 times now, and I get the file, but it 
has CRC errors all through the LBR. Is anyone else out there having the 
same trouble???? I thought at first that it was a transmission error, but
after requesting and downloading the same file 10 times, I have to assume
that the original at Simtel is corrupt.
 
Does anyone have an uncorrupted version????
 
Help!!

I believe I have a copy of it at home. Only problem is this...I have a CP/M
machine at home, and no way that I know to transfer it to my account at work
(ultrix).  I do not have kermit.  I do have xmodem if you wish to coordinate a
time to call me at my home this weekend.

My phone # is (916) 631-0990 (in California) (home), and work is (916)
351-6735.

Subject: Kaypro interrupts
Message-ID: <912@crash.cts.com>

     Is there anyone out there who has any experience with using interrupts
on a Kaypro?  I refer specifically to a Kaypro 4/84 ( 81-185 motherboard ).

     I've been fooling around with it for quite some time now, but can't get
a thing out of it.  I've replaced both the CPU and the offending SIO chip,
but still no interrupts.

     The computer works fine... so I know NMI's aren't being ignored ( both
the floppy and the HD controller use NMI's to indicate that they need
service ).

     Or did my adding the HD controller to the setup do something?  The mother-
board has the connector, just as it should.  I used all Kaypro parts, except
for the HD itself ( which was an old 10 Mb I had on the shelf ).

     The motherboard originally had the 292 ROM in it... I've replaced that
with the 302-C ROM in a 2764.

     The problem exists under all versions of CP/M that I've tried.  These
are F, G, and H.  It's running F right now.

     Is there something in the Kaypro design that precludes using the Z80
maskable interrupts?  The schematics for the boards don't indicate that...
They make it seem very straightforward.

     I've also tried the PD program's INTTERM and HMK2112.  Both should
operate in an interrupt mode.  Neither does.

     Help!

[File: SIMTEL-ARCHIVES.INFO		Last revised: December 15, 1989]


                     THE SIMTEL20 ARCHIVES

OVERVIEW

There is a collossal amount of free public domain software for the
CP/M, PCDOS/MSDOS, Macintosh, and UNIX operating systems, and for the
DoD standard programming language, Ada, in several archives on
WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL (IP host number 26.2.0.74), a DECsystem-20
running the TOPS-20 operating system at White Sands Missile Range,
New Mexico.  Archives of correspondence for several newsgroups are
also available.

You can obtain these files using the InterNet file transfer protocol,
FTP (described in a following paragraph), with user-name "anonymous".
For a login password, use "guest", your host-name, or any other string
of printing characters.  Throughout this message, FTP examples are
given in a GENERIC syntax.  You will have to consult either local
documentation or your friendly system wizard to learn the actual
syntax used with your local mainframe operating system.  For the sake
of brevity, the full host name "WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL" will be
dropped from further references to SIMTEL20 in this discussion.

To obtain directory listings, connect to SIMTEL20 via FTP and do this:

  get pd1:<msdos>msdos.crclst
  get pd2:<msdos2>msdos2.crclst
  get pd1:<pc-blue>pc-blue.crclst
  get pd2:<cpm>cpm.crclst
  get pd2:<cpmug>cpmug.crclst
  get pd2:<sigm>sigm.crclst
  get pd3:<macintosh>macintosh.crclst
  get pd3:<misc>misc.crclst
  get pd2:<unix-c>unix-c.crclst
  get pd2:<ada>ada.crclst

There is also a comma-delimited directory listing in each top-level
directory, FILES.IDX, which is suitable for importing into a database
program.  This file may be of greater use than the crclst files
because it can be compared against an earlier version of the same file
to produce a complete list of files added and deleted from the
archives.  Using the comma-delimited fields it is possible to build a
script for FTP to maintain a parallel archive.  FILES.IDX can be
printed or displayed with a simple BASIC program.  For more information
see PD1:<MSDOS.FILEDOCS>AAAREAD.ME.

The <CPM>, <MSDOS>, <MSDOS2> and <MACINTOSH> archives are the ones to
watch for the very latest offerings, as they are updated frequently.

The <CPMUG>, <SIGM> and <PC-BLUE> archives contain software distributed
by the CP/M Users Group, the SIG/M Users Group and the PC-Blue Users
Group respectively.  This software is available on diskettes from the
associated user groups, and the archives are updated as new volumes
are issued.  The <PC-BLUE> archive contains software for the IBM-PC
and similar machines.

The <MSDOS> and <MSDOS2> archives also contain software for the MSDOS
and PCDOS operating systems; but these archives are locally managed,
and therefore are updated more frequently than the <PC-BLUE> archive.

The <UNIX-C> archive contains a variety of UNIX tools.  Those which
apply specifically to CP/M are in the directory <UNIX-C.CPM>.

The <ADA> archive is growing rapidly. Information about this archive
is in directory PD2:<ADA.GENERAL>.  In general, the archived software
is very good, having been worked-over and refined by many users.  The
documentation and comments tend to be complete and informative.

Files in all of these archives can be obtained using the FTP procedures
described in this message.

PLEASE NOTE:  Due to the large number of files available, the archive
maintainers cannot possibly attempt to validate the proper operation of
the various programs.  When a program bug is reported, immediate action
is taken to either correct the error or remove the offending program
from the archives.  Still, users must understand that all archive
programs are offered AS IS, and the archive maintainers specifically
disclaim any liability should these programs malfunction or cause
damage, incidental or otherwise.  When testing ANY new software, be
certain that all information stored on disk is backed-up before you
start, so that you can recover if files are damaged or erased.  This is
particularly true if you have a hard disk, in which case malfunctions
can be spectacularly disasterous.

FILE TYPES

Files are stored in two formats: Text files such as those with names
that end with DOC, HEX, INF and ASM are sometimes stored as ASCII
files, but sometimes these files are stored in binary compressed
form.  Binary storage is also used for executable (COM and EXE) and
library/archive files  (LBR and ARC).  All binary data are stored as
four 8-bit bytes per 36-bit SIMTEL20 word, with the low-order four
bits of each word filled with zeros.  If such a file is interpreted
as a contiguous string, as will happen if a straight binary transfer
is made to a 16 or 32-bit UNIX machine, the four zero filler-bits per
36-bit group will cause rather bizarre and frustrating results.

For information on ARC, ARK, LBR, squeezed and crunched files, get
PD2:<CPM>-FILES.DOC and/or PD1:<MSDOS>-FILES.DOC.

Although the type of storage used for a particular file can usually be
inferred from the file-name, this is not always true.  It is a good
idea to check the appropriate "crclst" file to ascertain the storage
format used for each file of interest.  Now, and for the foreseeable
future, storage formats for files in the <SIGM>, <CPMUG> and <PC-BLUE>
archives can be determined from their "generation numbers", as shown by
the FTP directory command.  For example, the FTP command:

  dir pd1:<pc-blue.vol001>

will yield results of the form:

  -CATALOG.001.2
  ABSTRACT.001.2
  BW.ASM.2
  BW.BAS.1
  BW.EXE.1
  COLOR.ASM.2
  COLOR.BAS.1
  COLOR.EXE.1
  ...and so on

All files with names ending in ".1" are stored in binary format, and
those with names ending in ".2" are stored in ASCII.  This relationship
will continue to apply for files in the <SIGM>, <CPMUG> and <PC-BLUE>
archives until further notice.

WARNING: Because the public domain archives on SIMTEL20 consume a huge
amount of disk space, storage capacity will be conserved by the
greatest practical use of libraries, archives, crunched and squeezed
files, all of which are stored in binary format.  If you cannot
properly transfer binary files, you are going to be VERY FRUSTRATED!
If you need help, please contact your local system wizard and provide
him/her with a copy of this message.  Having done that, if you are
still unable to make things work correctly, send a message to
Action@WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL and someone will try to help you.
Please provide the following information:

 1. Machine and operating system  (e.g., VAX-11/780, 4.3 BSD UNIX)
 2. Network software in use  (e.g., 3-Com UNET)
 3. Complete list of available FTP commands  (e.g., GET, PUT, etc.)

Important files in the <CPMUG> and <PC-BLUE> archives are the
CATALOG files. These files, which are stored in ASCII, contain the
"-CATALOG.nnn" files from all the volumes of their respective archives.
To obtain these composite catalog files, connect to SIMTEL20 via FTP
and do this:

  get pd2:<cpmug>cpmug.cat
  get pd1:<pc-blue.vol000>pcblue.cat

Similar files exist for the <SIGM> archive, but they are stored in
squeezed form.  These files, when unsqueezed, yields SIG0.CAT and
SIG1.CAT (the catalog).  They can be obtained using the FTP command:

  get pd2:<sigm.vol000>sig0.cqt
  get pd2:<sigm.vol000>sig1.cqt

(NOTE: That's "L-and-three-zeros" in "vol000")

FILE TRANSFER VIA FTP

FTP stands for File Transfer Protocol, a formalized procedure for
moving files among machines on the Defense Data Network (DDN) and other
networks that connect with the DDN.  The protocol is implemented by a
program often called FTP.  The different mainframe operating systems
implement FTP with variations in command syntax.  Some systems have the
remote-file-name precede the local-file-name in the command.  Others
reverse this order.  Some versions have the whole command on a single
input line, while others use multiple lines.  Read the documentation
for your local system, or consult a friendly system wizard for the
details of your local FTP command syntax.

UNIX users can do something like "man ftp" for on-line instructions.
However, not all UNIX FTP programs are called "ftp", so you may have
to snoop around in the system directories or ask a system wizard for
the correct local name to use with the "man" command.  ITS users can
do ":INFO FTP", and "HELP FTP" works on TOPS-20 and some other
operating systems.  I will be happy to update this message with
pointers to other sources of on-line documentation if they are sent
to w8sdz@WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL.

FTP transfers from SIMTEL20 can be made with user-name "anonymous".
Use GUEST for the password.  For anonymous logins, SIMTEL20 supports
the FTP "change working directory" command.  (Your local syntax may
be something like CD, or CWD).  Ignore the message which may appear
that prompts you to enter a password.  This command allows you to
specify a default SIMTEL20 directory to be used for all file
retrievals, and thereby relieves you from having to repeatedly type
"pdx:<whatever>" as part of each filename.  For example, you can do
something like this:

  cd pd2:<cpm.goodstuff>
  get filename-1
  get filename-2
  ...and so on

instead of using the longer filename forms shown in previous examples.

Users of TOPS-10, TENEX, TOPS-20 or ITS systems can use "image" or
"paged" mode for ALL transfers.  UNIX users must use "ascii" mode for
ASCII files, and "type tenex" or "type L 8" mode for binary files.
MULTICS users can use "ascii" mode for ASCII files, but binary files
require special treatment that is best described by the following
example provided by Paul Schauble <Schauble@mit-multics.arpa>:

 !ftp simtel20
  220 WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL FTP Server Process 5Z(14)-7 at [date/time]

  user_ftp:  !login anonymous
  331 ANONYMOUS user ok, send real ident as password.
  Password:  !guest

  user_ftp:  !quote "type l 8" <--(NOTE: That's lowercase "L" 8.)
  200 Type L bytesize 8 ok.

  user_ftp:  !get micro:<cpm.zcpr3>alias.hlp alias.hlp
  150 Retrieve of MICRO:<CPM.ZCPR3>ALIAS.HLP.1 started.
  226 Transfer completed.
  Total elapsed time:  35.7 seconds.
  4348 bytes transferred in 18.5 seconds (1850 bits/sec).

  user_ftp:  !quit
  221 QUIT command received. Goodbye.

Lines beginning with "!" are typed by the terminal user. The received
files are stored on MULTICS with one 8-bit byte per 9-bit word, and can
be transferred to a microcomputer with Kermit (described in a
following paragraph).

All aspects of the FTP process for UNIX machines have been automated
to a high degree by a program in directory PD2:<UNIX-C.CPM>. With this
program, a simple command like "mb modm700.com" can connect to
SIMTEL20 and transfer the binary file "modm700.com" from directory
PD2:<CPM.MODEM7> to a local file also named "modm700.com", all with no
user intervention.  Batch command files containing multiple lines of
the form in the above example can be run in no-hangup background mode
to transfer whole directories without the user even remaining
logged-in on his local system.  For more information, get the file
PD2:<UNIX-C.CPM>AUTOFTP-DOC.TXT.

NEWSGROUP CORRESPONDENCE ARCHIVES

Copies of correspondence for several newsgroups are kept on SIMTEL20
in directories with names of the form PD2:<ARCHIVES.KEYWORD>, where
"KEYWORD" has been chosen to indicate the associated newsgroup. At
present, the following correspondence archives are available:

     newsgroup        mail archive filename
  ---------------     ---------------------
  ADA-SW              PD2:<ARCHIVES.ADA-SW>
  AMETHYST-USERS      PD2:<ARCHIVES.AMETHYST>
  INFO-68K            PD2:<ARCHIVES.68K>
  INFO-APPLE          PD2:<ARCHIVES.APPLE>
  INFO-CPM            PD2:<ARCHIVES.CPM>
  INFO-FORTH          PD2:<ARCHIVES.FORTH>
  INFO-HAMS           PD2:<ARCHIVES.HAMS>
  INFO-MICRO          PD2:<ARCHIVES.MICRO>
  INFO-MODEMS         PD2:<ARCHIVES.MODEMS>
  INFO-XMODEM         PD2:<ARCHIVES.XMODEM>
  INFO-MODEMXX        PD2:<ARCHIVES.MODEMXX>
  INFO-MODULA-2       PD2:<ARCHIVES.MODULA-2>
  NORTHSTAR-USERS     PD2:<ARCHIVES.NORTHSTAR>
  PACKET-RADIO        PD2:<ARCHIVES.PACKET>
  INFO-PASCAL         PD2:<ARCHIVES.PASCAL>
  UNIX-SW             PD2:<ARCHIVES.UNIX-SW>
  VIDEOTECH           PD2:<ARCHIVES.VIDEOTECH>
  INFO-XENIX310       PD2:<ARCHIVES.XENIX310>

Descriptions of these and other newsgroups can be obtained via FTP with
anonymous login (as for SIMTEL20) from the Network Information Center's
host SRI-NIC.ARPA.  Ask for the file PS:<NETINFO>INTEREST-GROUPS.TXT
(an ASCII file).  And please note, this is NOT on SIMTEL20.

File names for SIMTEL20 newsgroup correspondence archives have two forms
For example, PD2:<ARCHIVES.CPM>CPM.ARCHIV.ymmdd-Z (files with names ending
in -Z are compressed with the Unix compress program) is a group of files
containing INFO-CPM correspondence going back several years. The characters
"ymmdd" in the file names are actually digits giving the year, month and
day of the last message in each particular file.  Current correspondence
is kept in the file PD2:<ARCHIVES.CPM>CPM-ARCHIV.TXT, which is constantly
changing. Although INFO-CPM has been used as an example here, the same
naming scheme is used for the other newsgroup files as well.  For a
complete list of available files, connect to SIMTEL20 via FTP and do this:

  dir PD2:<ARchives>

You will receive a list of names of the form:

  KEYWORD.DIRECTORY.n

where "n" is one or more digits.  For example, the INFO-CPM listing
currently appears as "CPM.DIRECTORY.1"  To then get a list of files in
a particular archive, do this:

  dir PD2:<ARchives.keyword>

where "keyword" (for example, "cpm") is chosen from the preceding list,
and the word "directory" and the number "n" are not used.  At present,
all of these files are stored in ASCII.

FTP PROBLEMS, FILE ERRORS, CONNECT OR LOGIN PROBLEMS

System-related problems should be reported to ACTION@WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL.

                Accessing the SIMTEL20 archives from BITNET

                                                Updated 15 November 1989
------------------------------------------------------------------------

     This document describes a method for users of systems connected to
BITNET to obtain files from selected archives kept at the MILNET node
WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL.  The information applies specifically to the
file servers installed at NDSUVM1 and RPIECS (formerly RPICICGE).  (A
similar service is provided to EARN by a set of servers collectively
known as "TRICKLE"; those servers accept similar, but not identical,
commands.)

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Background
------------------------------------------------------------------------

     The US Army maintains a huge collection of public domain (and
"shareware") software and information on WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL, a
DECsystem-20 machine running the Tops-20 operating system at White Sands
Missle Range, New Mexico.  The collection covers a spectrum of
interests, including files of interest to CP/M and MSDOS users.

     The collection is "open to the public"; anyone may obtain copies
of the files using the Internet file transfer protocol, FTP.  The bad
news is that FTP is not a protocol available over BITNET.  BITNET users
can not directly obtain files from the SIMTEL20 collection.  The good
news is that there are several file servers located  throughout BITNET
that will accept requests for SIMTEL20 files and perform the appropriate
file transfer on the requestor's behalf.  However, please understand
that...

     The BITNET servers that provide access to the SIMTEL20 archives
     have no affiliation with the US Army nor with White Sands Missle
     Range.  Also, the BITNET servers are made available in the true
     spirit of volunteerism (both of the institutions where they are
     installed and of the individuals that support them) without any
     outside sponsorship for the service.
Also...
     Due to the large number of files available, neither the
     archive maintainers at SIMTEL20 nor the server maintainers in
     BITNET can possibly attempt to validate the proper operation of
     the various programs.  When a program bug is reported to an
     archive maintainer, immediate action is taken to either correct
     the error or remove the offending program from the archives.
     Still, users must understand that archive programs are offered
     AS-IS, and the archive maintainers and server maintainers
     specifically disclaim any liability should these programs
     malfunction or cause damage, incidental or otherwise.  When
     testing ANY software, be certain that all information stored on
     disk is backed-up before you start so that you can recover if files
     are damaged or erased.  This is particularly true if you have a
     hard disk, in which case malfunctions can be spectacularly
     disasterous.

     The BITNET servers provide access to the following subset of the

SIMTEL20 path names, file names and file types
------------------------------------------------------------------------

     The Tops-20 operating system supports a hierarchical file system
structure not unlike that found on Unix, Vax/VMS, and even MSDOS
systems.  At SIMTEL20, the software collection is divided into
individual archives by category, each with its own file system
directory.  The archives are subdivided by topic into sub-directories.
The following example is a typical path name for a SIMTEL20 file:

          PD:<MSDOS.STARTER>UUDECODE.BAS

Here, PD is the name of the disk where the archives reside.  (Well,
actually it is an alias for a group of disks PD1, PD2, and so on.)
MSDOS is the name for the archive; STARTER is a sub-directory containing
generally useful programs and information.  UUDECODE.BAS is the name for
one such file in the STARTER sub-directory.

     File names of files in the SIMTEL20 archives generally conform to
the conventions of the target system (e.g. CP/M and MSDOS).  From the
example above, UUDECODE.BAS is a uudecode program written in BASIC.
(MSDOS.STARTER also contains UUDECODE.PAS and UUDECODE.C, versions of
the same program written in Pascal and C, respectively.)  The model of
"name.extension" should be familiar to most.  Extensions of DOC, HEX,
INF and ASM are associated with ASCII text files; COM and EXE, with
binary executables.  However, in an effort to reduce the online storage
required by the files, and to organize software into packages, most of
the files at SIMTEL20 have been through some flavor of data compaction
and/or library utility.  The file extensions used for such beasts may
be less familiar to some:

ARC   a collection of related files compacted and collected together
      into a single package, and called an ARChive.  An un-archive
      utility is needed to extract individual files from the package.

ARK   exactly the same as ARC.  ARK is used in preference to ARC in
      the CP/M archives.

LBR   a collection of related files compacted and collected together
      into a single package, and called a LiBRary.  An un-library
      utility is needed to extract individual files from the package.

xQx   a file that has been compacted using a Huffman encoding method
      known as sQueezing.  The extension is derived from that of the
      original file with the letter Q substituted in the middle.  (An
      ASM file that was squeezed would be stored as AQM.)  An
      un-squeeze utility is needed to recover the original file data.

xZx   the same as xQx except that an LZW-variant method known as
      crunching has been used.  An un-crunch utility is needed to
      recover the original file data.


Most of the software for MSDOS systems are stored in the ARC format.
All four formats are used in the software for CP/M systems.  (ARK and
ARC represent the same thing, but ARK is the more commonly used name.)
Only a  few "first-time-user" type files (like UUDECODE.BAS) are stored
in their raw form.  The section below titled "Getting Started" gives
some guidance about handling them.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Using the BITNET Servers
------------------------------------------------------------------------

     In the United States, there are two BITNET servers that provide
access to the SIMTEL20 archives:

          LISTSERV@NDSUVM1   North Dakota State University.
          LISTSERV@RPIECS    Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.

--------Note--------Note--------Note--------Note--------Note-----------
     In Europe, there are many EARN servers.  However, the information
provided here is specifically for the BITNET servers.  The EARN servers
have a similar user interface and may accept the same set of commands,
but information about using them is beyond the scope of this document.
The locations of the EARN servers and the principle contact person for
each are:

          TRICKLE@TREARN    ("Turgut Kalfaoglu"   <TURGUT@TREARN>)
          TRICKLE@IMIPOLI   ("Marco Gandolfi"     <MARCO@IMIPOLI>)
          TRICKLE@BANUFS11  ("Michel Daulie"      <DAULIE@BANUFS11>)
          TRICKLE@AWIWUW11  ("Gustaf Neumann"     <NEUMANN@AWIWUW11>)
          TRICKLE@DB0FUB11  ("Wolfram Fassbender" <EARNIE@DB0FUB11>)
          TRICKLE@EB0UB011  ("Oriol Robert"       <ZCCBORR@EB0UB011>)
--------Note--------Note--------Note--------Note--------Note-----------


     Requests may be sent to a server as RFC822-style mail.  The
commands to the server must appear in the body of the message, not the
Subject: line.  The server uses the From: header to determine how to
address the files to be returned.  The From: header must therefore
specify a valid, reachable network address from the server's point of
view.  Mail received from outside BITNET, particularly from UUCP,
often have unusable return addresses.

     Requests may also be sent as interactive BITNET messages if your
system supports such a facility.  On an IBM system, this service is
provided by the TELL command, as in

          TELL LISTSERV AT nodename  servercommand

     The server does enforce some limits on how much can be requested
by whom and from where.  Requests from EARN are not accepted; they
must be delivered to the nearest TRICKLE server in EARN.  For others,
the server restricts how many files and how many bytes of data a user
may request per day.  It also restricts how many files and how many
bytes a host system may request per day.  The limits are changed on
occasion, they are but they are in the neighborhood of

     3 files/user/day            10 files/host/day
   100 Kbytes/user/day          300 Kbytes/host/day

There are some files that are larger than the per-day limit for a user
(or host) would permit, so the server does allow the first request from
a user (or host) on any given day to exceed the byte limit.  Also, the
"host" in this context means what appears after the at-sign (@) in the
return address.  Mailed requests that pass through a gateway usually
appear to be from that gateway host, and so the server applies its host
limits accordingly.

--------Note--------Note--------Note--------Note--------Note-----------
     Although requests are sent to the LISTSERV address, the requests
are actually processed by userid TRICKLE.  Files sent back to you will
be from TRICKLE.  Do not let this mislead you, though:  Your requests
must go to LISTSERV, and not to TRICKLE at either NDSUVM1 or RPIECS.

     In EARN, LISTSERV is not used, and TRICKLE does accept requests
from users.  NOT IN BITNET.  Your requests must go to LISTSERV.
--------Note--------Note--------Note--------Note--------Note-----------


THE /PDDIR COMMAND

The /PDDIR command is used to list the names of files that match some
pattern.  The command has several forms.  They are:

        /PDDIR
        /PDDIR  PD:<directory>
        /PDDIR  PD:<directory.subdirectory>filename.ext  age

     The first form lists the names of all the archives known to the
server.  At present these are CPM, SIGM, PC-BLUE, MSDOS, and MISC.  The
second  form lists the names of all the subdirectories in a particular
archive.  (The directory name must be one of the known archives: CPM,
SIGM, etc.)  The third form lists the names of files in the archive that
match a particular pattern.  The age parameter limits how old a file in
the archive may be and still be considered.  If omitted, the default is
30, meaning 30 days old.  The directory name must be one of CPM, SIGM,
PC-BLUE, MSDOS, or MISC.  The subdirectory, filename, and ext may
include asterisks ('*') a "wild-card" characters.  The following are
examples.

        /PDDIR PD:<MSDOS>  --Lists subdirectories in the MSDOS archive.
        /PDDIR PD:<SIGM.*>*.*   --Lists files added in the last 30 days
        /PDDIR PD:<MISC.VAXVMS>*.* 9999  --Lists VAX/VMS related files.
        /PDDIR PD:<CPM.*>UUDECODE*.* 9999  --Lists uudecoders for CP/M.


THE /PDGET COMMAND

The /PDGET command is used to request a specific file.  No pattern-
matching is allowed.  The syntax for this command is as follows:

        /PDGET  format  simtel.filename  encoding

     The format specifies how the file is to be transmitted.  Allowed
values are NETDATA, PUNCH, and MAIL.

     NETDATA  -- suitable for transfer to BITNET hosts that can accept
                 files in IBM Netdata format.

     PUNCH    -- suitable for transfer to BITNET hosts that can accept
                 files but cannot decode the Netdata format.  Files
                 are sent as 80-byte card-images.

     MAIL     -- suitable for transfer to hosts that can accept only
                 mail or are accessible to BITNET only through gateways.
                 Large files sent via mail are split into several
                 smaller files that the recipient must reassemble.

If the format is omitted, NETDATA is assumed for BITNET hosts and MAIL
for all others.

     The encoding specifies any special translation for the file data:

     ASIS     -- suitable for hosts that can receive binary data.  The
                 file is sent exactly as it is stored on the server:
                 binary images of the file data.  ASIS may be used
                 only with format NETDATA.

     UUENCODE -- suitable for hosts that cannot receive binary data.
                 The file is sent uuencoded.

     TRANSLATE -- suitable for any host, but only when the file actually
                 represents readable text.  The file is translated to
                 EBCDIC.  (If you are on an ASCII machine, then your
                 system should automatically translate to ASCII when
                 the file arrives.)  TRANSLATE applied to a binary file
                 is treated as if UUENCODE were specified.

If no encoding is specified, then ASIS is assumed for NETDATA, and
UUENCODE for the others.

--------Note--------Note--------Note--------Note--------Note-----------
     In the actual archives at SIMTEL20 there are a few files stored in
the top-level directory.  (For example, PD:<MSDOS>FILES.IDX is a file
listing the names of all the files in the subdirectories of the MSDOS
archive.)  The design of the BITNET server does not permit access to any
of these files.  However, since the files at the top-level directory
generally contain directory information, the need for them is superceded
by the /PDDIR command.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Getting Started
------------------------------------------------------------------------

     Before all else, something you absolutely must have available is
a method for getting files from your host system to you micro computer.
It would be preferable if this method included support for transferring
binary files as well as normal text files.  If you do not already have
a way to communicate with your host and transfer files, consider getting
the appropriate Kermit implementations available from the KERMSRV file
server at CUVMA.

     Once that minor detail has been addressed, then you should consider
what additional utility programs you will need or that will be helpful.
Most files are in an archive format, so you will need a de-archive
utility or two.  You may also need a uudecode program, depending on your
ability to receive binary files on your host and your ability to
download binary files to you micro computer.

     This last point requires some explanation.  The server stores all
files from SIMTEL20 as-is in 128 byte sector image blocks.  They are
bit-for-bit identical to how they should appear on your micro computer.
The server makes no attempt to interpret the files; it simply sends them
on demand out through BITNET.  BITNET, though, is fundamentally an
EBCDIC network, and your micro computer is fundamentally an ASCII
machine.  This gives rise to two places along the path from server to
micro where the file data might be misinterpreted or corrupted.

     If your host system is ASCII-based (as are most non-IBM systems)
it will translate incoming BITNET files from EBCDIC to ASCII.  If your
host is EBCDIC-based, your communications software will translate files
you download from EBCDIC to ASCII.  But the files from the server do not
contain EBCDIC data.  You must either find a way to disable the
translations or encode the data in such a way that the original file
can be recovered.

     There are suggestions given later for specific host machines to
disable the translations.  For now assume data encoding is required.
You can ask the server to send files in encoded from.  If you request
encoding, the file is encoded using a technique know as uuencoding.
Uuencoded data is preserved through most of the EBCDIC/ASCII
translations the file might encounter.  So, all you need is a program
for you micro computer that decodes a uuencoded file.

     There are several decoders available from SIMTEL20.  The only
problem is how do you get the program to your micro computer.  Catch-22.
Well, you can ask the server to send ASCII text files in translated
form.  If you request translation, a file is first translated to EBCDIC
before it is sent.  This is not recommended as a standard option since
there may be some loss of information, but for getting started it may
be essential.

     If you need a program for CP/M to decode uuencoded files, send the
following command to the server:

        /PDGET PD:<CPM.STARTER-KIT>UUDECODE.HEX  TRANSLATE

The file contains the CP/M hex data for the program.  Download it.  Use
the CP/M commands LOAD and SAVE to create an executable program.  You
should end up with UUDECODE.COM, the desired program.

     If you need a program for MSDOS to decode uuencoded files, send the
following commands to the server:

        /PDGET PD:<MSDOS.STARTER>UUDECODE.xxx  TRANSLATE
        /PDGET PD:<MSDOS.STARTER>UUENCDEC.DOC  TRANSLATE

Replace "xxx" with either BAS, C, or PAS depending on which source
language you would prefer (BASIC, C, or Pascal, respectively).

     Next, you should consider requesting which ever of the following
files you feel appropriate for your micro computer system:

For PC-DOS and MSDOS machines:
     PD:<MSDOS.STARTER>ARCE40C.COM       Un-archive utility.
     PD:<MSDOS.STARTER>ARCE40C.DOC       ..and the documentation.
     PD:<MSDOS.STARTER>UUDECODE.EXE      Compiled uudecode utility

For CP/M machines:
     PD:<CPM.STARTER-KIT>DELBR11.COM     Un-library utility.
     PD:<CPM.STARTER-KIT>UNARC.COM-Z80   Un-archive utility, Z-80 only.
     PD:<CPM.STARTER-KIT>UNARCA.COM-8080 Un-archive utility.
     PD:<CPM.STARTER-KIT>UNARC.DOC       ..and the documentation.
     PD:<CPM.STARTER-KIT>UNCR-Z80.COM    Un-crunch utility, Z-80 only.
     PD:<CPM.STARTER-KIT>UNCR8080.COM    Un-crunch utility.
     PD:<CPM.STARTER-KIT>UNCR8080.DOC    ..and the documentation.
     PD:<CPM.STARTER-KIT>USQ120.COM      Un-squeeze utility.
     PD:<CPM.STARTER-KIT>USQ120.DOC      ..and the documentation.

There are many other useful utilities in these and other archive
directories.  Remember, though, if you need the server to UUENCODE the
files you request, you should explicitly ask for it.  Also, some of the
programs listed above may be replaced by newer versions.  (For example,
ARCE40C.COM replaced the earlier ARCE31C.COM.)  If you have trouble with
the server claiming "file not found", use the /PDDIR command to list the
the appropriate directory.

     You may find two other files useful.  PD:<MSDOS.FILEDOCS>SIMIBM.ARC
and PD:<CPM.FILEDOCS>SIMCPM.ARK contain one-line descriptions for many
of the  other files in their respective archives.  Not all files are
described, but it does contain enough valuable information to help you
find other software.


IBM System Users.

If your host is an IBM system running either VM or MVS, you can avoid
the need for uuencoding.  Files received from BITNET will not be
translated, since the IBM is an EBCDIC machine.  Most down-load methods
support binary transfer, so you can defeat the translation that would
otherwise take place there.  For example, with CMS Kermit the command
SET FILE BINARY is all the is required before initiating a download.
If you are using a 3270 emulator and IND$FILE for file transfers, by
default no translation takes place.


VAX/VMS Users.

If your host is a DEC VAX system running VMS, with Jnet as your network
software, you can avoid the need for uuencoding.  You can tell the Jnet
software to bypass the usual EBCDIC/ASCII translation, but there are a
few additional steps needed before downloading a file.

    *  Receive the file with the Jnet command RECEIVE/BINARY.  The
       BINARY modifier suppresses the normal EBCDIC/ASCII translation.
       For the sake of discussion, assume that the file is now named
       SOFTWARE.FIL.  This file, as received, is almost correct; but
       there may be an error in how VMS interprets the records.

    *  Generate an FDL file for SOFTWARE.FIL using the command

          ANALYZE/RMS/FDL  SOFTWARE.FIL

    *  Edit the FDL file with the command

          EDIT/FDL  SOFTWARE

       Examine the CARRIAGE_CONTROL setting.  Change it to NONE.  Exit
       from the editor.

    *  Use the edited FDL to correct carriage control interpretation
       errors in the original SOFTWARE.FIL.

         CONVERT/FDL=SOFTWARE.FDL  SOFTWARE.FIL  FIXED_SOFTWARE.FIL

    *  Download the FIXED_SOFTWARE.FIL as a binary file using any
       reliable means.  (For VAX Kermit, use the SET FILE TYPE BINARY
       command before starting the download.)


------------------------------------------------------------------------
Common Problems
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q. I downloaded this program to my micro, but when I run it, my machine
   hangs (or I get the message "Out of Memory" or ...).

A. Either the file became corrupted in transit (perhaps one of those
   nasty EBCDIC/ASCII translations), or the file was uuencoded and you
   have not decoded it.


Q. I downloaded an archive to my micro, but the de-archive utility
   would not process it.  I get messages like "File not an archive" or
   "Cannot extract member".

A. Same comments as above.


Q. I really, really need to get these special files that I absolutely
   must have, but the server limits how much I can request per day.  Is
   there any way I can get around these limits for this one special case

A. No.


Q. I am trying to get a file from the (top-level of the) MSDOS
   directory.  /PDDIR won't list it, /PDGET claims it can't find it,
   but I know it is there.

A. It may well be there at SIMTEL20.  However, the BITNET server is not
   capable of handling any request for a file from the top-level of an
   archive.  Generally, though, the files stored at the top level list
   the contents of the archive.  The /PDDIR command can be used to get
   a directory listing.


Q. I have been requesting this same file repeatedly.  Each time the
   server tells me my request has been "queued for processing," then a
   few days later it sends me a message that it has "abandoned" my
   request.  Other requests it has been handling just fine.

A. The server does maintain a large "cache" of recently requested files.
   Many requests are satisfied from this cache.  However, for all the
   rest the server must fetch it directly from SIMTEL20 using the
   Internet file transfer protocol, FTP.  "Directly" really is not
   all that direct since the path between server and SIMTEL20 includes
   many network segments and gateways.  To complete a transfer, an
   error-free connection must be maintained for the duration of the FTP
   transaction.  This is not always possible, whether it be from some
   dysfunction along the path or heavy network load.  The server will
   retry a failed FTP transaction, but if it continues to fail, the
   server eventually gives up.


Q. I keep sending requests to the server.  I never hear anything back.

A. The server responses in some way to everything it receives.  Your
   requests may not be arriving, possibly because you are miskeying the
   server's network address.  Perhaps you are sending your requests to
   TRICKLE rather than LISTSERV.  Your requests may be arriving, but
   with an unusable "From:" field in the mail header, so the response
   never gets back to you.


Q. Gee, this public-domain/shareware stuff is the greatest.  How do I
   go about adding my own contributions?

A. Remember, the archives are actually kept at SIMTEL20.  The servers
   only provide access to them.  Contributions must be sent to the
   people there.  Send an electronic mail message to:

     "Keith Petersen"  <W8SDZ@WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL>

   Be sure to tell him what it is you have and what it is for.  After
   he verifies he does not already have it, you and he can negotiate
   methods for submitting the software.


Q. Hey, I have FTP on my system.  How do I go about connecting to
   either RPIECS or NDSUVM1 and fetching the SIMTEL20 files?

A. Two points about the servers have been missed.  (1) The servers are
   there to provide access to the SIMTEL20 archives for people WITHOUT
   FTP capability.  Users on hosts that do support FTP have the
   privilege of connecting directly to WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL.  (2) The
   servers do not actually have a complete collection of the archives;
   only a varying set of recently requested files are stored locally.
   If you have FTP access to the Internet, connect to
   WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL and use anonymous login.


Q. Who do I contact with suggestions or unsolvable problems?

A. Depending on which server you normally use:

     "John Fisher"     <FISHER@RPIECS>
     "Marty Hoag"      <INFO@NDSUVM1>

   DO NOT send your comment or question about the server to the people
   at WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL.  However, if you wish to report program
   bug or something similar about a SIMTEL20 file, you may send it to

     "Keith Petersen" <W8SDZ@WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL>

          Ordering SIMTEL20 files from European file servers
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Date: Sat, 16 Dec 1989  23:31 MST
From: Keith Petersen <w8sdz@WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL>
Subject: Ordering SIMTEL20 files from European file servers
Message-ID: <KPETERSEN.12550739571.BABYL@WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL>

This is for European readers.

                        RED - Listserv Redirector
                (C)1988 Turgut Kalfaoglu <TURGUT@TREARN>

What is RED?
RED provides  the SIMTEL-20   files, and directory listings, with its own
cache, where  it keeps  its most recently requested files. It reduces the
network load  by providing the cache, and by providing directory listings
locally, instead  of through   a  distant list  server.. It  is a machine
(process) that runs disconnected from a terminal.
  Currently, the eight sites that run this  software are called:

In Denmark:   TRICKLE@DKTC11
In Turkey:    TRICKLE@TREARN
In Italy:     TRICKLE@IMIPOLI
In Belgium:   TRICKLE@BANUFS11
In Austria:   TRICKLE@AWIWUW11
In Germany:   TRICKLE@DB0FUB11 or TRICKLE@DTUZDV1
In Spain:     TRICKLE@EB0UB011

You are urged  to use the one that is  closer to your location.
In this  tutorial, we will  be using 'TELL TRICKLE  AT TREARN', but  this
can   be   replaced   with   'TELL   TRICKLE    AT    <your  location  of
preference>'

We also  will use  the 'TELL'  command to send a single line message.  It
should be  replaced with  whatever is appropriate for your system.  (Like
XMIT ,  SEND, etc.)  If you  are on  a node  that cannot  reach a TRICKLE
directly, for example, a JANET node, then you must send MAIL files to the
server. Simply  put the  commands, one per line, into the text portion of
your mail. If you are using MAIL, you do not need to put 'TELL TRICKLE
AT TREARN' in front of every command - every line has to begin with a
slash (all valid trickle commands begin with a slash).
You can also place more than one command per command file.

What Does it Provide?
A Milnet node, SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL at White Sands Missile Range, New Mexico
contains a  large selection  of public  domain and  'shareware' software.
This DECsystem-20  machine, running the Tops-20 operating system provides
many files of interest, especially to CP/M and MSDOS users.

The collection is open to public, anyone may obtain copies of this of the
files using  the Internet  file transfer  protocol,  FTP.  However,  this
protocol is  not available to Bitnet, or EARN sites. For this reason, two
servers in The United States, who have a connection both to Milnet and to
Bitnet, provide us with these files. However, since both of these servers
are in  The US,  the requests  of these  files puts a burdon on these two
servers. The  solution was  to create  a server here in Europe that could
provide the  files requested,  send the directory listings, and also keep
the recently  requested files,  in case  someone else  wishes to have the
same file.

We,  the  server  operators,  would  like  to  stress  that  we  have  no
affiliation with  the US  Army, nor with White Sands Missile Range. These
servers are  made available  in the  true spirit of volunteerism, without
any outside sponsorship for the service.

The Trickle, and The US servers support the following directories:

CPM  Software and information for CP/M users. Contributions are gathered
   from a variety of sources, including the members of the Info-CPM
   electronic mail discussion group. This archive is updated very
   frequently.
MSDOS  Software and information for PC-DOS and MS-DOS system users. This
   archive is updated very frequently.
PC-BLUE  Software and information for PC-DOS and MS-DOS system users. The
   archive contains files distributed by the PC-Blue Users Group. New
   files are added as they become available.
SIGM  Software and information for CP/M users. The archive contains the
   files distributed by the SIG/M Users Group. New files are added as
   they become available.
MISC  Software and information for miscellaneous systems (mostly large
   systems like IBM/370 and DEC VAX). Contributions are gathered from a
   variety of sources.
MACINTOS Software and information for Apple Macintosh computers.
UNIX-C   Software and information on this operating system.

How does it work?

   It provides  faster file  delivery than  LISTSERV@RPIECS because  it
holds the  most recently  requested files, and it also asks its peers, to
find out if any of them has the file.

  It has two major commands.  /PDDIR and /PDGET..  As the names indicate
, /PDDIR provides the names of the files, and /PDGET delivers files.

How to use /PDDIR:
  On IBM/VM systems, you can get a list of the 'major directory' names by
simply typing this command:
                      TELL TRICKLE AT TREARN /PDDIR

RED should  now send  you a  list of the major directory names.  Now, you
can obtain a list of the sub-directories of any of the displayed names by
putting the  name between  less-than  and  greater-than  symbols..    For
example,
                  TELL TRICKLE AT TREARN /PDDIR <MSDOS>

RED will  mail you  a file  containing the  names of the sub-directories.
Once you  choose a  subdirectory to  examine, type  in the main directory
name, a  period, then the name of the subdirectory name.  For example, if
you chose SYSUTL sub-directory of MSDOS, then you may type this:
              TELL TRICKLE AT TREARN /PDDIR <MSDOS.SYSUTL>

RED will  first notify  you of  the number  of files  found, then will go
ahead and  mail you  this list..   Once you choose your file(s) to order,
then read on..

How to use the /PDGET command:
   Once you  have a filename in hand, then tell RED to send you this file
by providing  it with the full directory name, and the filename..  If you
wish to  order a game called MADMAX.ARC that resides in the <MSDOS.GAMES>
directory, then you may type in this command:
          TELL TRICKLE AT TREARN /PDGET <MSDOS.GAMES>MADMAX.ARC

naturally, the  above is  only an example, and the file may or may not be
present if you send the above command.

Receiving your file in a different format:
Normally, SIMTEL  files are sent AS-IS, meaning, ASCII. If you would like
to receive your file in a different format, you may want to append any of
the below to the end of any of your your commands:

(EBC80 Converts the file to 80-Column EBCDIC format
(EBC32 Converts the file to 132-Column EBCDIC format
(UUE uuencodes the file
(OLD Sends the file using DISK DUMP or PUNCH format
(SF Supresses BITSEND, and forces SENDFILE to be used for the transfer.
(MAIL Forces results to be sent via MAILER.  (This option is
   automatically added for MAIL command files)
(XXE  XXDECODES the file that is to be sent to you.
(HEX  Turns the file to HEX format - use it if even (XXE doesn't work for
   you.
(BTOA BTOA-Encrypts the file. Useful for Unix systems.

You may  also wish  to combine several options together.  For example, to
receive a directory listing in PUNCH format, and UUEncoded,
            TELL TRICKLE AT TREARN /PDDIR <MSDOS.C> (OLD UUE

To receive a file in in EBCDIC format, you may enter a command that looks
like this:
      TELL TRICKLE AT TREARN /PDGET <MSDOS.GAMES>MADMAX.ARC (EBC80

However, it  is not  useful at  all to  receive an  .ARC file  in  EBCDIC
format. The above is not a terribly good example.

Other commands:
/NEWS  sends you our 2-page newsletter.
/STAT  provides you the statistics of usage.
/HELP  sends you this file.
/IMDAT  sends   the  Turkish  version  of   this  help  file.  Note that
   this command is only valid for the TREARN server.
/CAC Sends  you a list  of the files  that are stored  on its disk right
   now. These files  can be sent  faster than the other files.
/OPS   displays the RED operators
/QUO Shows  you the RED's quota,  and how much of  that quotait has
   used.  Once  RED  exceeds its  quota,  it  cannot order files,  until
   it receives some  of the requested files.
/SUB <dirnam> Allows  you  to  subscribe to  a  directory.  Whenever a
   new listing  comes in,  RED  will send  you a  file containing the
   names of the new files.
/UNSUB <dirnam> is to stop RED from sending you the new files listings.
   Please issue this command  if you will not use the server anymore.
/NEW <dirnam> nnn This command, displays the files that have arrived
   within 'nnn' days, in the 'dirnam' directory.  If 'nnn' is omitted, it
   defaults to the last time you issued this command, for that directory.
   If you are issuing this command for the first time, then it simply
   looks for files that are at most a month old.
/POLL forces RED to check its peer servers

Delay Periods:
   If the  file that you requested already exists in the cache directory,
then you  may expect  to receive  your file within a few hours.  However,
the system  that RED  is running  is  often  slowed  down  by  the  other
processes that are running.  This negatively affects the response time of
RED.   If the  file requested  does not existin the cache directory, then
RED will  have to  order this file from its list server..  If this is the
case, the  response time  of RED  is dependent upon the list server.  RED
will give  up waiting  for a  file after  five to  twelve days  after its
request.

Sending files to RED:
   RED now accepts command files in MAIL, NOTE, or regular file format.
Use your system's (and yours) favorite utility to prepare your command,
and mail it to the server. If you are using MAIL, you may need to place
Reply-To: tag to ensure that the server replies to the address that
you specify, instead of your 'obvious' address.

The command files may contain any number of instructions, one per line.
These lines must all start with a slash, since all server commands begin
with a slash.

If you are on a site that is not part of BITNET/EARN, you will receive
the files you request UUENCODED. You may tell the server otherwise
by specifying (XXE (HEX or (BTOA at the end of your command. If you
wish to make sure that the server replies via mail, you need to append
(MAIL to the end of your command.

How to DONATE files to Simtel Archives:
   Files that  you receive from here are sent from another network called
ArpaNet.   The person-in-charge  for  the  programs  is:  Keith  Petersen
<w8sdz@WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL>. Since  it's  another  network,  you  will
need  to  use  MAIL  to send  the  message. He urges that you talk to him
before  you send in  the file,  so that he can  check where  it should be
put, if  it already exists,  etc.   After getting  his approval, you need
to UUENCODE your file (perhaps using PDUTIL), then MAIL it to him.

Format of the files that comes with /PDGET command:


For the  below chart,  we shall  assume that  you  have  not  placed  any
conversion options at the end of your command.

If you have used:        You can expect the file to arrive:
-----------------------------------------------------------
'tell' style message:    BITSEND, NETDATA format.
-----------------------------------------------------------

MAIL command file:       UUENCODED, in numbered pieces.
-----------------------------------------------------------
A regular file, or       Just like 'tell' messages,
IBM's NOTE command:      replies in BITSEND, NETDATA.
-----------------------------------------------------------

RED will  send the files in  a NETDATA format, -unless  you use the  (OLD
option-.  On IBM systems, these files can be LOOKed and RECEIVEd, but the
PEEK command cannot handle NETDATA format properly.  However, since  most
files  are ASCII, it  is of little use to LOOK at them.

Since SIMTEL (and your personal computer) keeps its files in ASCII format,
so does TRICKLE. So, you may not be able to examine your file on the
VM system. However, some of the description files (recognized by their
names) can be ordered with the (EBC80 or (EBC32 option, if you wish to
look at these files on the VM.

The .ARC format:
  ARC is a special compression method that provides substential reduction
on file  size.   There are  one or  more files  contained within  an .ARC
archive.   In order to extract the files from an archive, you will need a
utility called  ARC or  PKXARC. These are  available from  <MSDOS.ARC-LBR>
directory.   The actual  file names of these files vary, but you may try:
TELL TRICKLE   AT   TREARN  /PDGET   <MSDOS.ARC-LBR>PK361.EXE or:    TELL
TRICKLE   AT   TREARN /PDGET  <MSDOS.ARC-LBR>ARC512.EXE If these attempts
fail, it will probably mean that the file version has changed, and so has
the file name.  You may wish to try
              TELL TRICKLE AT TREARN /PDDIR <MSDOS.ARC-LBR>
and guess the new name of these files.
Once you  receive either ARC or PKXARC and an .ARC file, transmit them to
your personal computer and issue the following command:
                          ARC X <filename.arc>
                                   or
                           PKUNPAK <filename>

There is  also a  second utility  called ARCUTIL,  which runs  on the  VM
systems, and extracts files.  It also provides ASCII to EBCDIC conversion
of the extracted files.  To request ARCUTIL, enter:
      TELL  TRICKLE  AT   TREARN  /PDGET  <MISC.IBM-VM>ARCUTIL.LBR

  The directories of SIMTEL change often.  So, the above files may or may
not be  in the  same directories as I have indicated.  So you may have to
do some  searching to  find them..   A  good place  to check would be the
<MSDOS.STARTER> directory,  where  additional  help,  and  the  mentioned
archive managers can be found.

How to use the BITSEND/BITRCV:

From now  on, RED is sending its files in a special format called BITSEND
- Unless you include the (SF option while issuing your command.
  In this format, the files that are sent are broken into smaller pieces,
if the  entire file  is too  big to  be sent.  If the file you request is
over the  size limit,  then the  server will first send you a file called
<fn> BITCTRL  - this  is the  control file, where BITSEND has written the
protocol used, the number of pieces that make up that file, etc.

-------------------------------------------------------
Important:
You   should NOT  'RECEIVE' any  files that  have BITCTRL
or just numbers as filetype!

-------------------------------------------------------

If you  wait a  little longer,  the rest  of the  file will  arrive,  the
filename will be the same as the <fn> BITCTRL file, but the filetype will
consist of  just numbers.  Once you have all the pieces that make up that
file, you  can then  issue the BITRCV command.  You must also specify the
'spool ID'  of the  file that has BITCTRL as filetype.  From RDRList, you
can simply type BITRCV in front of the file that has BITCTRL as filetype.
If you  get back  an error  message, saying  "UNKNOWN CP/CMS  COMMAND" it
simply states  that your  installation does  not have the BITRCV program.
Contact your network manager/system operator.
Note: BITRCV  EXEC can  be obtained  from your  country NETSERV  as well.
Simply send "GET BITRCV EXEC" to your NETSERV.

-----------------------------------------------------------
VAX users:
There is  also an  identical file  for your  installation, however, it is
called 'BITRCV  COM', and  can be  obtained from a NETSERV by issuing GET
BITRCV COM to your country NETSERV.
-----------------------------------------------------------

If you  get back  an error  saying that  not all  of the  file is  in the
reader, it  simply means  that you  have to  wait a little longer for the
rest of the file to arrive.

If you are on a different system, thus cannot use neither BITRCV EXEC nor
COM, you can simply merge the files you receive using your editor.

How to receive the file that arrives:
Once the file you requested arrives, and is stored on your disk, you will
most likely wish to 'download' this file to your personal computer. There
are many  types of mainframe computers, many kinds of personal computers,
so it  is impossible  for me  to give you direct, and precise directions.
However, here are some clues:
  * If you have a PC with a 3270 Emulation program, and an IBM mainframe,
   you should request your files from the server without options, or with
   (SF option, and use the built-in transfer protocol of the emulation
   program, without any options again.
* If you have KERMIT at your installation, request your file without
   options, or with (SF option, then set the KERMIT's FILE-TYPE to BINARY
   before transferring your file.
* Remember that if you send a MAIL command file to the server to request
   your file, the file will arrive in UUENCODE format, since the mailer
   cannot process binary files - unless you specify (XXE or (HEX in the
   command line.

How Does the Cache Work?
    Imagine that you ask for a file, and the server brings this file from
United States for you. Thinking that others may wish to have this file as
well, the  server keeps this file in an area called 'cache.' When someone
else requests  this file,  the server  simply uses the stored copy of the
file, instead of asking for the file again from overseas. All the servers
that you  see on  top of  this document  have different  files  in  their
caches. So,  if you wish to see the files they are holding right now, you
will have  to issue '/CAC' to each one of them. Note that a file does not
stay in cache forever. As new files arrive, the older ones are deleted to
make room.

The Amazing Life of a /PDGET request:
     Once you order your file via /PDGET, the server will first check its
local cache  listings. If  the file  is not there, then it will check the
SIMTEL20 listings  to ensure  that a such file indeed exists. After this,
the server  sends the  request to  all other servers, asking them if they
have your file in cache. If a server replies 'YES!', then that server has
to send  you the  file.   Everything fails: none of the servers have your
file, or  even some  servers don't  respond. Your  server  will  give  up
waiting for a reply in a day, and order your file from the United States.
Once the  file requested  arrives from there, it will be sent to you, and
put into the cache directory. Quite a trip for one /PDGET command.

Quotas, and Other Ugly Limitations
You may be surprised that even though most TRICKLE servers have some kind
of quota, we still get several hundred requests daily. Without them, this
number may  easily rise to thousands.  The impact of a such usage rate on
the local  computer can be very 'tiring.' So, the following quota schemes
have been implemented:
1) Total outstanding bytes quota: This quota is not really put by the
   server's operators. It is the amount that a TRICKLE server can order
   from The United States. This is currently set at 10 megabytes for most
   servers.
2) Prime times: Some of the servers, do not function during the day, they
   record the commands received, and process these commands later, when
   the load on the computer is low.
3) User request limitations: Most TRICKLE servers have a limit on how
   many requests a user can make on the server per day. The request can
   be a simple /OPS command, or a file order via /PDGET. It still counts
   as one. The server will warn you that you are approaching the limit,
   once you have 3 more commands left.
4) Outstanding files per user: This scheme is also employed by some
   servers, and it limits the number of files a user can order from The
   United States.
5) Delayed Sendfile: This last scheme is simple: it delays sending your
   file until a specified time comes. Usually at night, when the network
   load is low. If a site uses delayed sendfile, you will see a '* Your
   file will be mailed' notice, instead of '* Your file is being mailed.'

A Last Word on Options:
Some of  the options are not compatible, such as (MAIL SF, and should not
be used together - the behavior of the server may be unpredictable. Also,
the (SF  option may  result in  a file that is too large for shipment. If
that is  the case, a network control program may detect it, and delete it
before it reaches you. Use (SF carefully.
Also, (SF  and (OLD options would be ignored if you send in your commands
in a  MAIL file.  If you  wish to  receive your files AS-IS, and still be
able to  put your  commands in  a file, you can either send a NOTE to the
server, or  simply create  a file  using your editor, then send this file
directly to the server, without first going through the mailer.

VAX/VMS Users:

If your  host is  a DEC  VAX system  running  VMS  with  Jnet  networking
software, you  can avoid  the need  for uuencoding. You can tell the Jnet
software to bypass the usual EBCDIC/ASCII conversion, but there are a few
additional steps needed before downloading a file.
* Receive the file with the Jnet command RECEIVE/BINARY. The BINARY
   modifier suppresses the normal EBCDIC/ASCII conversion. Let's assume
   that the file is called MYFILE.ARC. This file, as received, is almost
   correct; there may be an error is how VMS interprets the records.
* Generate an FDL file for MYFILE.ARC using:

   ANALYZE/RMS/FDL MYFILE.ARC

* Edit the FDL file with the command

   EDIT/FDL MYFILE

   Examine the CARIIAGE_CONTROL setting. Change it to NONE. Exit the
   editor.

* Use the edited FDL to correct carriage control interpretation errors in
   the original MYFILE.ARC:

   CONVERT/FDL=MYFILE.FDL  MYFILE.ARC  FIXED_MYFILE.ARC

* Download the FIXED_MYFILE.ARC as a binary file using any reliable
   means. (For VAX Kermit, use SET FILE TYPE BINARY command before
   starting the download.)

Additional Help:

1) A Discussion List
   We now  have an  online discussion list that gives assistance on the
   server. To  join this  list, simply  send the following command to
   either LISTSERV AT TREARN, or LISTSERV AT DB0FUB11:
              SUB RED-UG My-full-name

   Remember that you can use MAIL to interact with both TRICKLE and
   LISTSERV, and if you do, you need to put the commands in the mail
   body, and not in the subject section, like some other servers.

2) Other online documentation on the server
   You may request additional documentation on the workings of the
   server by issuing:
                INDEX RED-UG
   to LISTSERV@TREARN. Then order any of the listed files via
                GET fn ft
   command to LISTSERV@TREARN

3) Human Help
   Also, you  may get in touch with your local TRICKLE operator. You
   can get his network address by using the /OPS command.

We wish you great benefits from using TRICKLE - we know that the software
it provides can accomplish that.

Subject: SIMTEL20 CP/M index updated
Message-ID: <KPETERSEN.12551517457.BABYL@WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL>

The following changes have been made in the SIMTEL20 CP/M index,
which has been updated to reflect the above changes.

   1. All files are listed in SIMCPM.IDX.  Those which have no
descriptions have "No description available" in that field.

   2. NODESCR.IDX has been discontinued.

---

  A list of all files in the CP/M archives is contained in directory
PD2:<CPM.FILEDOCS> as follows:

SIMCPM.IDX contains a listing of all files, with a brief one line
description for each file.

SIMCPM.ARK contains the latest SIMCPM.IDX, AAAREAD.ME (this file),
     SIMCVT.BAS, SIMCVT2.BAS, SIMCVT3.EXC, SIMCPM.DB2, SIMCPM.HDR,
     SIMCPM.INF, SIMDISP.AWK, SIMDISP.DOC, and SIMCVT.FOR.

Also available:

QUICKREF.LST a quick reference list to SIMTEL20 CP/M directories.

SIMCVT.BAS and SIMCVT2.BAS are BASIC programs to convert SIMCPM.IDX
     to a human-readable text file.

SIMCVT3.EXC a VM/CMS REXX program to print SIMCPM.IDX

SIMCVT.FOR a VAX/VMS FORTRAN program to print SIMCPM.IDX

SIMCVT.SPS a VAX/VMS SPS program to print SIMCPM.IDX

SIMDISP.AWK an awk script for displaying SIMCPM.IDX in outline form.

SIMDISP.DOC explains how to use SIMDISP.AWK.

SIMCPM.DB2 tells how to use SIMCPM.IDX with dBASEII.

SIMCPM.HDR a PC-File+ database header for use with SIMCPM.IDX.

SIMCPM.INF information on record structure of SIMCPM.IDX.

PD2:<CPM>FILES.IDX is updated when new files are added to the CP/M
     archives.  This is a comma-delimited file, without descriptions,
     suitable for importing into PC-File+ or DBase III.


                         DISCLAIMER

Due to the large number of files available, the archive maintainers
cannot possibly attempt to validate the proper operation of the
various programs.  When a program bug is reported, immediate action is
taken to either correct the error or remove the offending program from
the archives.  Still, users must understand that all archive programs
are offered AS IS, and the archive maintainers specifically disclaim
any liability should these programs malfunction or cause damage,
incidental or otherwise.  When testing ANY new software, be certain
that all information stored on disk is backed-up before you start, so
that you can recover if files are damaged or erased.  This is
particularly true if you have a hard disk, in which case malfunctions
can be spectacularly disasterous.

         WHERE TO SEND COMPLAINTS, PROBLEMS, QUESTIONS

Messages about system problems, FTP problems, and network problems
should be directed to Action@WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL.

Messages about files in the CP/M collection should be directed to
w8sdz@WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL.

Messages about files in the SIG/M collection should be directed to

Does anyone out there have any information on how I could get a copy of
the following:

                aliens - like the arcade game only using ascii

Just out of curiousity, has or does anyone out there know of somebody
that A) Has BYE???.COM working on a Trs-80 Model 4 using CPM 2.2 or
3.0?? Or B) Runs a decent BBS in 2.2 or 3.0???
 
Basically this is all I want to do, but half the files I request from SIMTEL20
have errors, probably because of ascii transmission. I would use kermit, but
I don't have a kermit program that actually works in CPM. I have Qterm, but it
doesn't work on my machine either!

I guess I'm outta luck, time to get a Mac...

I've got an old version of BYE that works on my model 4.  It is up to you to
find a bbs to go with it, however.  Have you ever heard of Citadel?  I run
a Citadel board on my model 4.  Give it a call at (916) 381-4127 and see if
you like it.  After connect, type L to login, and follow the prompts.
If you like it, leave mail to "Jim Earl" and we can arrange a transfer of the
run-time code for you.  It runs on its own (it doesn't require BYE).

I already offered a Z80/Z280 disassembler in TurboC (ANSI) to Andy
Malis, and will send it to him. If there is general interest, I might
post it. Info:

Z280/Z80 disassembler *module* written in TurboC (should be easily
ported to any C compiler, the only ANSI-ness is prototypes and a little
string concatenation that could be removed with an ed script).

Disassembly for Z80/Z280 is compile-time selectable with a preprocessor
symbol. Sufficiently modularized to allow symbolic disassembly, e.g.

CD 05 00	CALL	BDOS

or (for instruction lists)

CD ** **	CALL	nn
JR **		JR	d

It is *not* a ready-to-run package, but a function "dis" that can be
used to disassemble an instruction. There is a little front-end with it
that allows generation of listings, both interactively and from a
script. Also a front-end to generate opcode charts (both Z280 and Z80)
is included with it.

So, does anyone want it posted ? It might take a while (need a modem to
upload it to the Sun first, etc...)

>Can this article arrive at USA ?

Don't know. At Europe anyway :-)

Let me know if you get any of these.  I do have a game similar to mchase
(ladders) with excellent installation instructions.  I would only be able to
transmit it with xmodem, since I don't have kermit, or uucp capabilities from
my home.  Let me know...my email address is below, as well as my home phone

Well, this  is going to be usefull... :)  I have BYE510 at home.  I don't know
if I have it only in library format or if it is actually working (yes, I have
a Model 4), and I do know someone that does run a BBS from a Model 4.

Hi Jim...   Zoomie here.

another person who is running a BBS on the Model 3 mode of the Model 4 (that

A friend of mine owns a Kaypro 2 that has been upgraded to a Kaypro 4.  
It seems that part of the upgrade included an alternate character set 
(mostly Greek letters).  My friend needs to know the escape sequence 
that turns the alternate character set on and off.  Can any of you 
Kaypro 4 owners lend a hand?

Subject: UUencoding by the RPIECS server
Message-ID: <KPETERSEN.12551938810.BABYL@WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL>

In response to this long debate about the various flavors of uuencode, I've
been researching the whole problem as best I can.  Not being a "Unix-person"
nor in close touch with the Unix community, this has taken longer than it
might otherwise had.  At any rate, the result is the following announcement.

Effective immediately:

(1)  The server at RPIECS uses the grave-accent substitute for blank in
     its uuencoder.  Since this eliminates the trailing blank truncation
     problem, the trailing M character is removed.  I believe that the
     uuencoding variant now in use conforms to the officially recognized
     standard method.

(2)  The option OLDUUE is available on the /PDGET command to explicitly
     request the trailing-M form for those that really need it.  The
     speculation is that no-one will, so this option may be removed in
     the future.

(3)  As an alternate to uuencoding, the so-called xxencoding method can be
     requested by specifying XXENCODE as an option on the /PDGET command.

(4)  The PDGET HELP file will be updated to reflect the changes.

The user-visible change here is that uuencoded files, implicitly or explicitly
requested, are now being sent in the newer format.  (Please note that
checksumming is *not* included.  I have been informed that this is not (yet?)
an official standard variant.)  I hope this is good news for some and no news
for most of you.

On the side of bad news:  In the process of making this change today, three
user requests for uuencoded data slipped in during testing.  They were
incorrectly sent out as xxencoded files.  My apologies to the users affected by
this error.

I am now in the process of packaging the server changes to forward to NDSUVM1.
I suspect the people there will be making the same changes in short order, but
the actual schedule is for them to determine.

An Altos 8000 has just appeared here at the office looking for a home.  It has
six apparantly serial ports, a 10M hard drive, a dead Shugart 801, and what
appears to be banked memory.  The machine is alive and boots off the hard drive
with some thing I am told is PDOS, a Pascal interpreter.

The subject line says it all.  Does Altos still exist?  Anybody have a real OS?
How about documentation?  One could create (slowly and very painfully) a bios

Your friend has the original Kaypro II character set.  You can use ESC G
to turn the greek characters on and off from the CP/M Prompt.  I'm suprised
he still has that ROM, and would look at the motherboard to be sure he
really has a II - IV upgrade.  He should have the Z80B microprocessor, and
should have no ROMs labeled XXX83 or less.

In response to the kaypro 4 character set .. I have a

eliminating the need for special programs for disk fix

and to turn it back off
<esc>h

Greetings, and Happy Holidays!
  
I am the proud owner of a NEC PC8401 CP/M laptop, which came with a
single 3.5" drive in the 8431 expansion drive box. The drive that is
currently installed is a TEAC FD 35-EN, SSDD drive. According to the 
books I have found, The unit is capable of being expanded to include
two drives, which would allow support of a 64k RAM, rather than the
usual 32k RAM.
  
What I am looking for, is one of the FD 35-EN drives. I have been in
contact with both TEAC (USA) and NEC (both parts and service sides) 
without success. Is there anyone out there who knows of some source
for these drives, or knows how to modify a currently available drive 
to work in the unit. I have access to numerous FD 35-F drives, which
are DSDD, but the pin connections on the back of the drives are VERY
different. Needless to say, I do not have a tech-manual for this
drive unit OR computer, and only have limited beginner's skills at
electronics repair and modification... but I'm learning!

Any help wopuld be greatly appreciated.
  
Thanks in advance...

Message-ID: <1127@polari.UUCP>

I have a machine which I would dearly love to put ZMP (Zmodem Program)
on.  However, I know less than a nybble about the 8251a usart chip that
it uses. Does anyone have a ZMP overlay (or is it insert??) for the
8251a and/or BMC if800 Model 20 (this is the computer).
 
Please don't send any mail to me at  polari!jeffery as I *might* not
get it after 1/5/90.  Best to send mail to  jeff@seaeast.wa.com or
rutgers!seaeast!jeff.  Thanks for any help/pointers....

Message-ID: <344@usource.SARASOTA.FL.US>

There has been a problem in running an NZCOM system on the Northstar
Horizon with the Northstar five inch hard disk controller.

I believe I have a solution to the problem, but would prefer not to 
release it until a couple of intrepid beta testers have tried to beat it 
to death. :-)

Any volunteers?  You would have to be running the above mentioned 
hardware, and have access to NZCOM.

Or, if you have NZCOM running satisfactorily on a Horizon with the N* five 
inch hard disk controller, I would appreciate hearing from you.

Replies via e-mail, please, as one of the groups I'm posting to is not 
received at my site.  Thanks.

Message-ID: <25337@cup.portal.com>

I goofed, It seems the part number for the external drive unit that came
with my NEC 8401 is a NEC8441! At least so I have been told!
  
I still need the drive to go into the #2 slot. Does anyone know of any
source for these, or know of anywhere they are available.
  
Your help will be greatly appreciated.

I have been doing it for about a month or so with a great deal of
success on my Dynabyte DB8/1 S-100 bus system.  If you like, I can
send you the software for it.  Plus I'd like to know what your
system is, so I can send you a patchfile as well (if there's one
available).

computers available from the CP/M user's group.  I searched the

find it.  I would like to obtain a copy of this compiler.  Does 
anyone know the address of the CP/M user's group or have any

It seems as though alot of people are trying to reply to me, but
are getting a message returned saying something to the affect that "CCU" is
not a valid host, well I am very sorry about that, but it seems that when
my messages finally make it through to you via various relays, that the relays
make my return address something very ugly, therefore, I will include this

Anyone that has tried to send me mail...PLEASE resend it!

Subject: CLOCK/CALENDAR FOR CP/M
Message-ID: <25398@cup.portal.com>

Greetings,
 
Again I address this thread to ask if there is anyone who knows of the
things I have been reading about. This past weekend I was reading over
some back issues of MicroCornucopia, and two articles came immediately
to my attention.
 
     1 - First was the article by Mitchell Mlinar about the building
         of a hardware clock for the Xerox 820-II.(MicroC, Oct '84)
         In the article, he describes this clock circuit and how it
         plugs into the Parallel printer port on the motherboard.
         Now, since I have a BBS operating on a Xerox 820-II, and
         seeing how I don't have an adequate way keep a battery back-
         up clock, I tried assembling the parts for this device.
         Unfortunately, I can't seem to find the 18 pin clock chip
         described in the article. Mitch asks for a MSM5832 clock/
          calendar chip. Well.... having called all over the nation
          looking for one, I still can't seem to find one. Is there
          source for these, or is their a modification to allow the use
          either the 24 pin or 16 pin clock chips from National Semi-
          conductor. I figure the schematic has been modified over the
          years, but surely someone out there knows how to build one,
          and would be willing to explain it to this ingnorant sysop.
  
      2 - The other article that caught my eye was from the April '84
          issue, that being an evaluation by Clarence Peckham of the
          Xerox 820-II and the LA Software Dynadisk, a 256k RAM array.
          Is there anyone out there who remembers these things?
  
          { Dang! asking like that makes me feel ancient! )
  
Any help will be greatly appreciated, and muchly welcomed! :)

Try JAMECO ELECTRONICS for that clock chip.  Their catalog shows a
MSM5832RS 18 pin Microprocessor Real Time Clock/Calendar for $2.95.
Address:
Jameco Electronics

I've had good luck with these guys, and recommend them highly.  They
ship very fast.

If you don't find the part you need, try buying the No Slot Clock. 
Basically it is a clock/calendar on a 28 pin rom socket.  Its
advertised in all the computer magazines for Apples and PC-compatibles
but I found it works great on my Kaypro II (pre-'83) even though the
Kaypro's socketed roms are 24 pin.  Since the software is not CP/M
you'd have to write your own software to access the clock.  This took me
4 or 5 hours in assembler.  Their documentation provides the interface
specs to the clock.  It plugs into any rom socket and the rom plugs into
the top of clock. (Putting it into a 24-pin socket requires one jumper.)
The clock passes all signals to the rom until a 64 bit sequence "unlocks"
the clock, at which time the clock can be read or written.
The cost?  Mine cost $45 a couple of years ago but I think I've seen them
since in the $35 - $38 range.

I've written a driver for the Intertec Superbrain, which uses an 8251 and
a BR1941M baud rate generator.  I haven't posted it anywhere, but if you'd
like the source, drop me a line.  Who knows, if might just take an equate
change to get it working for you.

It allows you to send and receive mail over Usenet (UUCP).  It
makes your system a "site" if you will.  I have DG's system running
on my S-100 box without problems.  You might want to contact Dave
Goodman as well to get it running, or Dave Goodenough, who wrote
that program, to help you.

Does anyone know of a Z-System compatible communications package?
If so, I would VERY much like to know.  I'm mildly sick of having
to reconfigure each individual communications package whenever I
get a new communications package.

If not, how can I make one (like ZMP, which, though it has the code
necessary for installation as a Z-System program, it doesn't use
it) Z-System compatible?

Thanks in advance...
