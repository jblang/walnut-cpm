The company is called MicroSolutions, Inc. out of DeKalb, IL.
The current version of Uniform will not run (sadly) under MS-DOS

Just another benifit to using CP/M.

I use the Software Toolworks C compiler, I am not sure that the ANSI C Standards
Committee had been struck yet when that compiler went on sale.

Just yesterday I got a hold of a TRS-80 level III emulator which
apparently is new.  It was called TRS80.ZIP (why are you not
surprised?), and I'll have a think about mounting it here at La Trobe in
the next few days.

It DOES need an image of the Level III ROM to work, so if anyone was
able to come good in that area, it would be great!

There's a great program called "Z80DIS" which has some artificial
intelligence which gives it an idea how to disassemble a program.
You can find it on SIMTEL20 or any good BBS.

Z8E's main function is as a debugger, and it fills that bill
BEAUTIFULLY!!!!!  It's the best debugger I've come across yet,
free or commercial.  I don't have anything to say about the stuff
that Sage Microsystems East has (hi, Jay!) because I've never
tried it.  But yes, it's great to have the source code for Z8E.

The VERY best I ever found is DazzleStar. It is an interaktive disassembler

WRONG! We have been selling an ANSI compatible C compiler
for CP/M for years (about 6 years to be precise, except
back then there was no standard, just a draft).

If you're using WordStar 4.0 under CP/M, ^QU (Quick Unformat is my 
favorite description for this one). [NOTE: That is control Q U] You might
want to hit a ^B (control B) as I don't recall if it reformats 
paragraphs correctly.

If, however, you are using an earlier version of WordStar, stripping
the eigth bit of each byte in the file works just fine. Here's an
easy method using PIP:
 
   PIP NEWFILE.NAM=OLDFILE.NAM[Z]

NOTE: You'd NEVER want to do this to a binary file (like .COM) for
obvious reasons! :)

	I desire to buy the second or "B" drive.

	I also might like to acquire the interface which allows the
computer to talk to a modem.  I know that such a thing exists, but I do
not have the model name or number.

	Also, if anyone knows if the Locomotive software is available
for other (more modern) computers, please let me know.  Or, if you have
suggestions for a different newsgroup to post this in, let me know that
also.

Subject: EZCPR question.....
Message-ID: <92122.225504U20565@uicvm.uic.edu>

I brought back my Commodore 128 from death (I had it boxed up in the basement)
and curiosity and nostalgia made me look at some disks.

As you may or may not know, the Commodore 128 can run CP/M, CP/M 3.0 Plus
to be exact. I had a bunch of diskettes from when I used to go to a local
computer club. I had a bunch of CP/M diskettes (had no idea what was on
them) and ran across EZCPR. At the time I had no idea what it was and
shrugged it off. Since then I learned it apparently is the predecessor
to ZCPR a replacement of the console command processor (CCP). Not that this
is critical or anything, but can it be used with CP/M 3.0?

Just curiosity, since then a machine with 10 megs of RAM has occupied my
desk for a while (80386), no life or death situation......

Subject: How do you extract files from .LBR files?
Message-ID: <92122.230015U20565@uicvm.uic.edu>

I never was a CP/M guru, a bit too young, I do have an old Commodore 128
though. Even though MS-DOS has longed replaced it as my primary computer
I was curious to see what kinds of CP/M software exists at various archive
sites. I did use my old C128 when I was a sophmore in college and while I
did have an account and therefore access to the net I was hopelessly
ignorant of this fact and never took advantage of that fact (back then).

Alll I largely see is .LBR files. If memory serves these are similar to
the ubiquitous .ZIP files from the MS-DOS world except that .LBR files are
simply files which have been grouped to form one file and not necessarily
compressed? Am I right? A la UNIX's TAR?

Well, regardless of whether they are compressed or not, I would like to
extract files (assuming I'm right). I have a program called LU.COM on old
CP/M diskette and surmised that this might be what I need. However I
received a prompt and no matter what I typed in all I received was a
question mark and some mish mash.

So the question is, how to extract files from .LBR files?

Please respond directly, thanks,
Mario Pacheco

EZCPR is for CP/M 2.2 and compatible operating systems only.  Z3PLUS, a 
commercial product, implements Z System for CP/M Plus.  It's about $50 
from Sage Microsystems.  I _think_ it runs on the 128 in CP/M mode, but am 
uncertain.

Message-ID: <55630@hydra.gatech.EDU>

Many thanks to those who responded to my question about Z80 disassemblers.
Wow, I didn't know there was still so much CP/M and Z80 stuff around.  I am
impressed by all the goodies that are available, many of them home grown.
Anyway, on to the summary.

Most people mentioned some of the CP/M based disassemblers available on
SIMTEL.  Evidently there is even a CP/M emulator which will run these on
a non-CP/M box.  Neat!  There are also some cross-disassemblers available
from uunet and from the authors directly.  Finally, there is at least one
commercial product from Pseudo Corp in Newport News, VA.  A list of all the
different disassemblers and related stuff follows.

Z80 Disassemblers
  ZDASM         from SIMTEL20
  DAZZLESTAR    from SIMTEL20 
  Z80-DIS22     from SIMTEL20 
  Z8E           from SIMTEL20 
  DIS80         from astro.as.arizioni.edu

The company is called MicroSolutions, Inc. out of DeKalb, IL.
The current version of Uniform will not run (sadly) under MS-DOS

There's a great program called "Z80DIS" which has some artificial
intelligence which gives it an idea how to disassemble a program.
You can find it on SIMTEL20 or any good BBS.

Z8E's main function is as a debugger, and it fills that bill
BEAUTIFULLY!!!!!  It's the best debugger I've come across yet,
free or commercial.  I don't have anything to say about the stuff
that Sage Microsystems East has (hi, Jay!) because I've never
tried it.  But yes, it's great to have the source code for Z8E.

Hi,

   I have acquired an Epsom QX-10 with manuals but there is a
wee problem - it doesn't have a boot disc! (I hasten to add
that I didn't buy this but was asked to check it). Epsom were
asked about this machine but didn't know anything about it so
this is about the only place I can ask - if it's an FAQ (which
I somewhat doubt {8-) then please mail me the FAQ list!

   The manuals say that this machine requires MultiFonts CP/M
which was an extension of CP/M 2.2 I believe.

   My question is this :

   (i) Does anyone have a system disc on 5.25 inch floppy - I
       can snail mail a disc for copying onto.

  (ii) Does anyone know where I can ftp the files from - I may
       be able to create a boot disc from another machine if
       someone would tell me the disc format in terms of sector
       and track layout at byte level (I love a hack!)

 (iii) Any other ideas on how to get this machine running?

   Replies via email please (unless you feel that the rest of
Usenet may benefit from the information {8-)

Hi Carson and other C=128 CP/M users,

CW>EZCPR is for CP/M 2.2 and compatible operating systems only.  Z3PLUS, a

CW>from Sage Microsystems.  I _think_ it runs on the 128 in CP/M mode, but am

Z3Plus certainly DOES run on the C=128 in CP/M mode and works quite nicely.
I also have DosDisk, from Plu*Perfect, too, and it allows and installable
MS-DOS file system, just like OS/2 finally does with HFPS.  However, mines
been working for at least two years.  Sorry, IBM, couldn't resist.

That is interesting, in that I have it running on an XT clone under PC DOS
5.0, but it also does not run properly under DR DOS 6.0 (it reads OK, but 
will not write to the disk) on my AT clone.

Just another benifit to using CP/M.

I use the Software Toolworks C compiler, I am not sure that the ANSI C Standards
Committee had been struck yet when that compiler went on sale.

Message-ID: <"12-May-92 17:56:44".*.Raymond_J._Clark.Wbst311@Xerox.com>

The "Big Board" was a very popular CPM-80 system in the early '80s before the
IBM PC came out.  It is virtually identical wire for wire to the Xerox 820.

I have 98s% of everything, just never built it.  Everything in emaculate
condition.

$150 or best offer.

Big-Board which features:
	Z80 CPU	Board designed for 2.5MHz, most owners ran
			at 4M.  I have all 4M parts.
	Z80 SIO	(2 serial ports, One  will be the console if you
			talk to it first on booting)
	Z80 CTC	Timer Chip
	Z80 PIO	Parallel ports chip.  I think 2 of 'em.
			One used for Console Keyboard if you talk to
			it first on booting.
	1771		Floppy disk controller chip, single density.  See
			below- I have a double density upgrade kit.
	Video		On-board video controller generates 80x25
			character display.
	RAM		64K using 4116s.  I have a 256K expansion
			board, see below.
	ROM Monitor source, both on 8" single sided single density
			floppy and on IBM-PC floppy.
	Documentation
			All original documentation including mulitple
			copies of the bare board to plan and document
			any modification.  Data sheets for all Z80 parts,
			Z80 assembly language manual & reference
			card.
	State of assembly
			All ICs socketed with gold machined contact
			Augat sockets.  90% of passive components
			installed.  Careful record of assembly to date
			following assembly manual and schematic
			with red pencil.  Beautiful job of assembling
			by a perfectionist (me).
		Single in-line sockets were used so you can cut and
		jumper between the pins on the top side of the board.
	Components included
			Almost everything, two of some things.
	Components missing
			No Problems:
			COM 8116 Dual Baud Rate Generator
				Jameco has in stock for $4.95
			74136
			74LS151
			Crystals:  14.31818, 20.0, 5.0688 MHz
				(Need 32MHz XTL to run CPU at 4M)
			Perhaps 10 misc. capacitors
	Data sheets for almost everything, including but not limited
		to all z80 parts, com8116, 1771, 2797.  The rest is
		standard TTL, 4116 DRAM, or 2114 SRAM.
	Modifications
		Modifications were planned for:
			Run at 4MHz
			Fix a video snow problem (faster character
				generator and planned change
				included.  Has been tested elsewhere)
			Change the video XTL frequency and clock
				divider to get a wider display.
		Patches for these may have been started on the
		board, although I am 99% sure they were not.  The
		changes were very simple, and could be backed out
		with a jumper or two using the schematics and
		copies of the bare board.  They will be documented
		if done, and there are probably notes on exactly
		what was planned, but no guarantees.
		Single in-line sockets were used so you can cut and
		jumper between the pins on the top side of the board.

256K expansion board.
	You loose the lower 64K.  I think the software that came
	with it uses it for a RAM disk (floppy comes with).  I have
	a SIG/M disk which is supposed to have Trevor Marshall's
	source to use it for track buffering.

Double Density Kit
	Daughter board for 1771 socket to use 2797.  No software,
	although I assume it should be possible to find similar
	software to do the blocking and deblocking and tweek it for
	this chip.  Data sheets included.

Floppy drives
	Two Shugart 801 single sided 8 inch drives, brand new,
	never out of box.

Video Monitor
	Brand new, never out of box.  Includes schematic.  No case.
	Comes with separate open fram 15v 1A power supply to
	run it.

Keyboard
	Very nice keyboard.  Includes schematic.  Parallel data
	with strobe (which is what big board wants).

Software
	Small C compiler, software to utilize 256K RAM board,
	z80 assembler, misc disks with unknown S/W (On 8 inch
	single density floppies).  IBM-PC floppy with source for
	ROM monitor, small-C, unknown other (it's been a
	long time...).

Power Supplies
	A Xerox 820 supply.  Switching supply with +5, -12, +12.
	I cannot say if this is adequate or not.

	15v 1A for the video display.

	You also need a 24 volt supply for the floppies.

Subject: A Few CP/M Questions
Message-ID: <9205110956.AA26569@LL.MIT.EDU>

Lou Glassy asked a few CP/M questions.

>> --What machines does CP/M68K run on?  Was this a product of
>>   DRI, or of some other vendor?

   I don't know very much about this, but there were a couple of Motorola
68000-based computers that had CP/M-68K.  The Sage computer (no relation to
me) was one of them.  I don't think there has been any activity in this area
for many years.

>> --Is CP/M still supported (ie sold, having apps developed for)
>>   by any current vendor?  If not, is the source code for it available?

   There is still a tremendous amount of activity in the 8-bit CP/M-
compatible computing area.  Most of this centers around Z-System, a modern
replacement for CP/M.  Besides occasional new versions of the operating
system itself, quite a few applications have appeared.  Many new public-
domain programs appear every month and are distributed by bulletin board and
via the Z-System Software Update Service (ZSUS).  There have also been a
number of commercial applications, such as BDS Z (a Z-System version of the
venerable BDS C compiler), ZMATE (a macro text editor derived from PMATE),
and ZMAC (a state-of-the-art macro assembler/linker/librarian package).

   You ask about source code.  I assume you mean for the operating system. 
Disassembled source code for CP/M has been floating around for at least a
decade (but who would want it!).  Source code for versions of ZCPR (which
replaces the CP/M command processor) through 3.3 has been released; the
source code to version 3.4 is available from me as a commercial product. 
There are several BDOS replacements, both public-domain and commercial.  The
PD ones are generally available in source-code form.

I think I have given people long enough to express an interest in the
surplus items in the collection of the Zi/Tel Group of the Boston
Computer Society.  This is the last notice I will publish.  These items
can be yours in return for a contribution to help fund user group
activities.  You may communicate an offer in any of the following ways:
 
    (1) by leaving a message on the Zi/Tel BBS in the Boston area
        at 617-965-7046 (or 617-965-7785 to limit access only to the
        USR Courier HST modem on line 2)
    (2) by leaving a message on Jay Sage's Z-Node at 617-965-7259
        (logon password is DDT)
    (3) leaving GEnie mail for JAY.SAGE
    (4) sending email to Jay Sage on Internet at the following
        address: sage@ll.mit.edu
    (5) sending postal mail to Jay Sage at
                1435 Centre Street
                Newton, MA 02159-2469

The email methods (first four methods above) would be best.  When it
comes time to send money, send a check payable to "BCS ZI/TEL" to the
Newton Centre address listed above.

Now for the inventory of items!
 
                +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

The hard-sectored diskettes for NorthStar computers have all been spoken
for, but there are still some other hard-sector diskettes available.
 
     18   boxes of 8" 32-sector hard-sector diskettes
      7   boxes of 5.25" 16-sector hard-sector diskettes
 
                 +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

Some of the miscellaneous hardware remains.  Much of it will be
discarded or stripped for parts very soon.
 
     1    Soroc 135 terminal
     1    Kaypro that needs work (loose connector in power supply is
            part of problem, certainly good for parts)
     1    mint condition Kaypro 2 with ComRiter diasy-wheel
            printer, original manuals
     1    Osborne 1, condition unknown

These items probably make sense only for people in the greater Boston
area who can pick them up from me.  I took the broken Kaypro down to
Trenton, but the person who had asked for it never showed up to claim
it.  I am about to pull out the disk drives and chuck the rest.
 
                 +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

There are still quite a few copies of WordStar 3.30 and MailMerge 3.31
in sealed, shrink-wrapped boxes, originally for Apple CP/M.  Many
copies already found their way to new homes with satisfied owners.  The
rest will soon be given to the trash collectors.  There might be a few
other MicroPro items left.
 
                 +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

There are still a few application paks for the HP-41 calculator.  I
don't remember which they are.  Ask if you have any interest.

                 +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

Someone at Trenton took one copy of each of the Sony SMC-70 software
packages.  These are probably not worth the cost of shipping anywhere,
but if you have an interest, now is the time to speak up.  I am going to
throw away the remaining copies at my next opportunity (perhaps after
pulling out the 3.5" diskettes for reuse and seeing if the binders could
be put to any good use).

   Last Friday I called Micro Solutions to ask about the problem of running
Uniform under MS-DOS 5.  What they told me is that the current version,
2.17, fully supports MS-DOS 5.  However, it does not, and probably never
will, run under DR DOS 6.  Updates to the current version can be obtained by
sending an original distribution diskette along with a check for $18 to

        Technical Support Department
        Micro Solutions, Inc.
        132 West Lincoln Highway
        DeKalb, IL  60115

They told me to be sure to include a note indicating what I was asking for
and giving my address and phone number.

   Since I am using DR DOS 6, I decided to experiment with 22DISK instead. 
As far as I can tell, it runs perfectly (can anyone else confirm this).  I
suppose that this is typical of shareware: way ahead of the commercial
houses.  However, 22DISK, like MediaMaster, does not do what Uniform does. 
One can only format diskettes and copy files to and from the foreign-format
diskette.  Uniform turns the foreign-format drive into a virtual DOS drive
on which one can use whatever tools one wishes.

Who makes a 64 emulator for DOS?  I know of one for the Amiga, which was 
fairly successful, except when trying to load a protected program that used 
the 1541's programmability to prevent copying.  But I wasn't aware of a 64 
emulator for DOS.  Of course, even if there were one, there's no way a DOS 
disk can read a 64 disk (MFM vs. GCR).

Actually, CP/M 2.2 logs in drive A because it needs to read
the CCP (and possibly BDOS) from the boot tracks.  Perhaps
a better way to handle it would be to modify your BIOS so
that you can change the physical to logical drive mapping.
Then, assuming that you can sysgen the RAM disk, you could
have a startup EX or ZEX script that would sysgen your RAM
disk and remap it as drive A.

The TurboBIOS for the Kaypro allows you to do this -- warm-
booting from the RAM disk is so quick you won't believe it.

You could also alter your BIOS so that it would read the
system tracks from your RAM disk instead of drive A.  The
problem here is to sysgen the RAM disk BEFORE a warmboot
occurs or you'll hang your system.  Then instead of always
accessing drive A, the CCP would just relog the current
default drive.

No. There are two different things here: Warm-boot and logging in. The
warm-boot (reading CCP, BDOS and perhaps even the BIOS from the boot
track) are done internally to the BIOS. If you have source to your
BIOS (or if you wrote it yourself), you can modify such that it
warmboots from any other drive (for example in my system, I can set
the boot disk to any disk in the system, frequently I set it to drive
C). Second, the BDOS will "log in" (read and decode the directory,
build the ALV) a drive whenever you start it (which is usually after
each warm-boot, although newer BDOS replacements can bypass this with
a fast relog option). Even though I am warmbooting from drive C, the
BDOS will still log in drive A. Now it gets even crazier: Assume I am
booting from drive C, and my current working drive is B (I have set
the current drive at address 0004h to "B" within the startup code for
example). The BDOS will still log in drive A after each warmboot! The
annoying thing is that even though I never need drive A I still have
to have a functional and readable drive connected there.

Lesson: Warmbooting is done internally to your BIOS. You may or may
not be able to tell your BIOS to boot from a drive other than A.  You
have a current working disk, stored at location 0004h. The BDOS will
always log in drive A when being started.

That's the way to do it. If you don't like drive A being accessed
all the time, declare your favorite drive to be A instead.

Hey Scott,

	Depends which Morrow terminal you have!!  They had three of them.
One is a ADM 20/22, one a Zenith Green screen, and one a newer Zenith gold
screen.  Hence the keyboards are all interchangable with their counterparts!!
I'm not sure of the Zenith terminal models but they are both very common!!!

If you need info please yell.  My father was the Morrow dealer in Indiana and
I grew up with these machines.  I also have complete service manauls for all
of them!!!

In general I have heard a lot of good about 22DISK (I am a registered owner),
but I personally have had a *LOT* of trouble using it with the Xerox 820 series
of computers (specifically the 820-II).  My current 386 (which has a
Compaticard IV for the floppy controller) works better with 22DISK than my old
286 did, but still does not work to my satisfaction.

I have heard of plenty of other people who have had no problem using 22DISK
with Xerox 820-II floppy disks though.  I have had no trouble with other floppy
formats that I have needed to use.  The thing I like best about 22DSIK is that
you can add disk formats to it, just by telling it the parameters.

On the other hand, I have never had a problem with UNIFORM and Xerox 820-II
floppies (on the same two computers).  I have a real old copy though, and
suspect I will shortly be getting their latest version.

Message-ID: <us92mINN54e@cs.utexas.edu>

I just got a machine called an Exxon Series 500 Information Processor.
I suppose, strictly speaking, it is not a CP/M machine, although it does
use a Z-80 and lots of other Zilog parts, so I'm posting this here.

The machine tries to run, but instead of starting up the word processing
software it seems to be dumping me out into some kind of diagnostic
monitor.  Here is what comes up on the screen:

ESOC SERIES 500 OPERATING SYSTEM   ID: AK0006.1H

RESET
 EXOS V BV0h

>

If I type a D at the prompt I get:

0D85 0BD5 C3FB 0B80 6008 0584 8181 2684

I can also type  G xxxx where xxxx is a hex number and it apparently tries
to execute whatever it finds at that address.  I can get it to reboot by
entering  G 0.  Entering  G 0584 (yes, I tried all the "addresses" I got
from D) seems to put it into some kind of memory inspection/modification
mode, something like DDT.

So, can anyone tell me about this machine?  Anyone have any technical specs?
Or (here's hoping) anyone have a CP/M boot disk for it?  :)  It looks like
a really well built piece of hardware and I'd hate to have to just
dismantle it for parts.  It has 64K of memory on board, and empty sockets
which lead me to believe it should be expandable to 256K.  (I did get the
operating manual and it mentions a 128K version.)  Any info beyond the
standard operations, or communications manuals would be helpful.

Subject: Importing external data into DataStar database?
Message-ID: <1992May14.152820.25841@iitmax.iit.edu>

Illinois Tech Model Railroaders (ITMR) has acquired an old Sanyo
SBC-1200 computer.  It runs CP/M.  We seem to have legitimate
copies of DataStar and ReportStar, but the reference manuals (if
any existed) have disappeared.  We do have a couple of
introductory or tutorial manuals. 

We have an existing machine-readable database which is stored in
a flat file format, and we would like to import that data into
DataStar so that we can use that product to maintain the
database.  The introductory manuals were good enough that we were
able to successfully create a new test database and we have had
no difficulty adding or updating records in the test database. 

However, all of our previous attempts to import old data without
retyping it have failed.  We are hoping someone on the net will
help us out with the following. 

1.  DataStar appears to have a feature to allow "batch" entry
    files to be merged with the main database, but it appears to
    require that the "batch" entry file have been created with
    DataStar.  When we experimented with using that feature to merge
    non-DataStar files, DataStar either erased the file or decided
    that there were no records in them. 
    
    Does DataStar have a mechanism for importing data from external
    (i.e. non-DataStar) files? 

2.  We could probably reformat the existing database to fool DataStar
    into treating it as a native DataStar database, but we don't know
    the correct format.

    Is there publically accessible information describing the
    format of the data and index files?  There does not seem to be
    any particular magic to DataStar data files--it looks like
    records are <cr>-delimited and fields are comma-delimited.
    However, I haven't been able to figure out the either the format
    of the index files or the way the index fields are calculated. 
    
Any help would be appreciated.  Perhaps there are other ways to
import the data we haven't thought of.   Please mail responses
to me.

Thanks!

Message-ID: <1992May11.220125.3970@CS.ORST.EDU>

I have just finished building a Ram Drive for my S-100.

The Ram Drive is FAST. Unfortunately, I've found a nasty 
piece of trivia about CP/M; there is a BDOS function that
resets the drive system. (0DH, I think.) It logs all the
drives out, sets the DMA to 80H, and then logs drive A
back in. Since drive A is a 5-1/4" floppy, this is slow
compared to logging in the Ram Drive.

What I would like to do is patch the BDOS so that it logs
Drive E in after reseting the drive system, does anyone know
how to do this. (I can't trace the call because DDT chokes
when you try to trace the BDOS.)

I am running CP/M 2.2.

It did not come with a operating system, software or disks.

Does anyone know of a users group in Southern California that I may

I think the Crown of stadium amp fame is based in Indiana (I have a cousin who 
used to work/still works for them.).  So I don't think this was made by them.

Message-ID: <1992May16.113956.3197@vax1.umkc.edu>

Has anyone used CPM and Wordstar on a Franklin Ace 2200, Apple IIe/c compat? 
Will it even work? I was recently given such a machine and want to move to it
from an Apple II+. I have a Microsoft CPM/Z80 Softcard for the Apple and need
to know if it will work in the Franklin.  Will I need to set any jumpers and in
what slot, 2, 5 or 4/7?  One slot is labled 4/7 and seems to be selected by a
jumper.  I don't have any documentation for the Franklin.


thanks

Subject: Looking for VT100 emulator in Z80 source
Keywords: Z80 terminal emulator vt100 source
Message-ID: <3693.volker@sfb256.iam.uni-bonn.de>

Hello all!

   I have this old Z80 computer gathering dust that I used to run CP/M
on long ago.  It's a Sharp MZ80B, with 64 KB RAM and a 24x80 screen
built in, two serial ports and several other extras.

   It occurred to me that I could use it as an extra terminal, so here's
my question:  Does anyone have Z80 assembler source for a VT100
emulation?  I don't want to run it off floppy disks, so it must be Z80
assembler.  The terminal emulator will either run in ROM, or I'll load
it from cassette tape.

   I haven't done any Z80 work for years, and I'd rather not write the whole
thing from scratch, so I'm grateful for any source that might be out there.
The CP/M BIOS did emulate a terminal called ADM3A, and I have source to the
complete BIOS, so I just might mangle that.  But I don't really know all the
escape sequences for the VT100, either.

  Anyone out there able to help?  Please reply by email.

  Thanks a lot in advance -- Volker

Message-ID: <1992May18.095923.4674@iscsvax.uni.edu>

Perfect Filer is a database that runs under CP/M and I need to export a
Perfect Filer database to a DOS file (eventually to Filemaker Pro on the Mac.)

The problem:  The database is running on a KayPro 10 micro (under CP/M) with a
10MB disk and 360K floppy.  The Perfect Filer manual ((c) 1983) does not mention
anything about exporting databases and Berkeley CA does not have a phone number
for Perfect Software, Inc.

Please help me:
o  Find out what happened to Perfect Software, Inc. (phone number of new
   business?)
o  Get a phone number for KayPro systems.

hausmann@nova.cs.uni.edu

P.S.  My situation is compliated by the database being 1.6MB in total size. 
The MUFBAR program used to back it up splits to files across many disks when
backed up.  I could write a C program that would extract the data from the
MUFBAR file, but I am looking for a more reliable method.

Check in Computer Shopper. There's a company still supporting the
beast. You can get parts, upgrades, an 8088 board w/ MSDOS 2.0
and a hard drive. They sell DBASE, Wordstar, etc. Look in the
classified section.

Polytechnic University in Brooklyn still uses them in their
undergrad Hardware Torture Lab (they're cheap & expendable) &
the local Northstar User's Group meets there. They might be a
good source too.

I have/can get software for the beast. I also have full manuals.
These are some of my favorite CP/M machines.

The best suggestion that I can offer is to get the package that contains
PF2ASC.COM from SIMTEL20 archives.  As the name suggests, it will convert a
PF database into a 'comma delimited' ASCII file which should be easy to import
into a foreign database program.  It is available under
             pd:<cpm.kaypro>pf2asc.lbr.

>o  Get a phone number for KayPro systems.
>
Kaypro's phone number is (619) 535-2155.  However, they are a skeleton outfit
now, that is devoted to PC clones, and I doubt that they can be of much help.

<Looking up from working on CP/M ZIP & UNZIP>

If you're using WordStar 4.0 under CP/M, ^QU (Quick Unformat is my 
favorite description for this one). [NOTE: That is control Q U] You might
want to hit a ^B (control B) as I don't recall if it reformats 
paragraphs correctly.

If, however, you are using an earlier version of WordStar, stripping
the eigth bit of each byte in the file works just fine. Here's an
easy method using PIP:
 
   PIP NEWFILE.NAM=OLDFILE.NAM[Z]

NOTE: You'd NEVER want to do this to a binary file (like .COM) for
obvious reasons! :)

There is a program called FILT (latest version 8.2) by the late Irv Hoff
that will solve your problem.  I would expect you will find it among the
archives on the Internet, but if not I will gladly send you a copy.

Plenty of software, both commercial and public domain.  Works fine and

I'll entertain offers, but mostly want to see someone use it.  If you're a

We have some data on two Z80 CPM machines that are being phased out in
favor of 386 DOS machines.  We need to get some of the data from the
160K cpm disks to DOS disks.  The two CPM machines are an Osborne and
a Phillips.  We have Kermit for the Osborne and can transfer the data
from there at 1200 baud over serial line but would rather not.  The
Phillips has no kermit and the Osborne kermit doesn't work on it.  Any
ideas? (even if they cost money)

thats where I run into trouble because I dont have my OS disk.  I called
Tek, and they want $295 (might as well be a thousand!) for a new disk and       manual.  I cant afford that!
so I was hoping someone out here had a suggestion... I could really
use this computer (I mean its impressive to look at and all... but it would 
really be nice if it worked).

Any help would be appreciated.

  It was a commercial package marketed for the Kaypro, and perhaps
some others.   I don't know if it's still around (Jay Sage, are you out

  There is an MSDOS version available from a company called Microsolutions
in DeKalb, Illinois.  I got my copy from Emerald Microware in Beaverton, 
Oregon when I was down there a few years ago .. I still make fairly

Dave, that is correct.  In fact, there are versions for various CP/M machines
and another called UniForm-PC for PC compatibles.  They are products of:

                Micro Solutions, Inc.
                132 West Lincoln Hwy.
                DeKalb IL 60115
                (815) 756-3411
 
Be advised, however, that because of the variations from one CP/M machine to
another, only the most popular of them had a version tailored to them.

The company is called MicroSolutions, Inc. out of DeKalb, IL.
The current version of Uniform will not run (sadly) under MS-DOS

Just another benifit to using CP/M.

I use the Software Toolworks C compiler, I am not sure that the ANSI C Standards
Committee had been struck yet when that compiler went on sale.

Just yesterday I got a hold of a TRS-80 level III emulator which
apparently is new.  It was called TRS80.ZIP (why are you not
surprised?), and I'll have a think about mounting it here at La Trobe in
the next few days.

It DOES need an image of the Level III ROM to work, so if anyone was
able to come good in that area, it would be great!

There's a great program called "Z80DIS" which has some artificial
intelligence which gives it an idea how to disassemble a program.
You can find it on SIMTEL20 or any good BBS.

Z8E's main function is as a debugger, and it fills that bill
BEAUTIFULLY!!!!!  It's the best debugger I've come across yet,
free or commercial.  I don't have anything to say about the stuff
that Sage Microsystems East has (hi, Jay!) because I've never
tried it.  But yes, it's great to have the source code for Z8E.

The VERY best I ever found is DazzleStar. It is an interaktive disassembler
and works almost like WordStar.

WRONG! We have been selling an ANSI compatible C compiler
for CP/M for years (about 6 years to be precise, except
back then there was no standard, just a draft).

If you're using WordStar 4.0 under CP/M, ^QU (Quick Unformat is my 
favorite description for this one). [NOTE: That is control Q U] You might
want to hit a ^B (control B) as I don't recall if it reformats 
paragraphs correctly.

If, however, you are using an earlier version of WordStar, stripping
the eigth bit of each byte in the file works just fine. Here's an
easy method using PIP:
 
   PIP NEWFILE.NAM=OLDFILE.NAM[Z]

NOTE: You'd NEVER want to do this to a binary file (like .COM) for
obvious reasons! :)

	The computer I am talking about is an Amstrad Personal Computer
Word Processor, Model PCW8256.  This is actually a CP/M machine,
i.e. 8-bit, which uses a proprietary 3-inch diskette (as opposed to
3.5 inch).  I bought mine when Sears Roebuck ran a sale a few years ago,
selling them as word processors running Locomotive software, not as 
general purpose computers.

	I desire to buy the second or "B" drive.

	I also might like to acquire the interface which allows the
computer to talk to a modem.  I know that such a thing exists, but I do
not have the model name or number.

	Also, if anyone knows if the Locomotive software is available
for other (more modern) computers, please let me know.  Or, if you have
suggestions for a different newsgroup to post this in, let me know that
also.

Subject: EZCPR question.....
Message-ID: <92122.225504U20565@uicvm.uic.edu>

I brought back my Commodore 128 from death (I had it boxed up in the basement)
and curiosity and nostalgia made me look at some disks.

As you may or may not know, the Commodore 128 can run CP/M, CP/M 3.0 Plus
to be exact. I had a bunch of diskettes from when I used to go to a local
computer club. I had a bunch of CP/M diskettes (had no idea what was on
them) and ran across EZCPR. At the time I had no idea what it was and
shrugged it off. Since then I learned it apparently is the predecessor
to ZCPR a replacement of the console command processor (CCP). Not that this
is critical or anything, but can it be used with CP/M 3.0?

Just curiosity, since then a machine with 10 megs of RAM has occupied my
desk for a while (80386), no life or death situation......

Subject: How do you extract files from .LBR files?
Message-ID: <92122.230015U20565@uicvm.uic.edu>

I never was a CP/M guru, a bit too young, I do have an old Commodore 128
though. Even though MS-DOS has longed replaced it as my primary computer
I was curious to see what kinds of CP/M software exists at various archive
sites. I did use my old C128 when I was a sophmore in college and while I
did have an account and therefore access to the net I was hopelessly
ignorant of this fact and never took advantage of that fact (back then).

Alll I largely see is .LBR files. If memory serves these are similar to
the ubiquitous .ZIP files from the MS-DOS world except that .LBR files are
simply files which have been grouped to form one file and not necessarily
compressed? Am I right? A la UNIX's TAR?

Well, regardless of whether they are compressed or not, I would like to
extract files (assuming I'm right). I have a program called LU.COM on old
CP/M diskette and surmised that this might be what I need. However I
received a prompt and no matter what I typed in all I received was a
question mark and some mish mash.

So the question is, how to extract files from .LBR files?

Please respond directly, thanks,
Mario Pacheco

EZCPR is for CP/M 2.2 and compatible operating systems only.  Z3PLUS, a 
commercial product, implements Z System for CP/M Plus.  It's about $50 
from Sage Microsystems.  I _think_ it runs on the 128 in CP/M mode, but am 
uncertain.

Message-ID: <55630@hydra.gatech.EDU>

Many thanks to those who responded to my question about Z80 disassemblers.
Wow, I didn't know there was still so much CP/M and Z80 stuff around.  I am
impressed by all the goodies that are available, many of them home grown.
Anyway, on to the summary.

Most people mentioned some of the CP/M based disassemblers available on
SIMTEL.  Evidently there is even a CP/M emulator which will run these on
a non-CP/M box.  Neat!  There are also some cross-disassemblers available
from uunet and from the authors directly.  Finally, there is at least one
commercial product from Pseudo Corp in Newport News, VA.  A list of all the
different disassemblers and related stuff follows.

Z80 Disassemblers
  ZDASM         from SIMTEL20
  DAZZLESTAR    from SIMTEL20 
  Z80-DIS22     from SIMTEL20 
  Z8E           from SIMTEL20

The current version of Uniform will not run (sadly) under MS-DOS

I've heard tell that Hi-Tech C is ANSI-compliant.  But don't

There's a great program called "Z80DIS" which has some artificial
intelligence which gives it an idea how to disassemble a program.
You can find it on SIMTEL20 or any good BBS.

Z8E's main function is as a debugger, and it fills that bill
BEAUTIFULLY!!!!!  It's the best debugger I've come across yet,
free or commercial.  I don't have anything to say about the stuff
that Sage Microsystems East has (hi, Jay!) because I've never
tried it.  But yes, it's great to have the source code for Z8E.

Hi,

   I have acquired an Epsom QX-10 with manuals but there is a
wee problem - it doesn't have a boot disc! (I hasten to add
that I didn't buy this but was asked to check it). Epsom were
asked about this machine but didn't know anything about it so
this is about the only place I can ask - if it's an FAQ (which
I somewhat doubt {8-) then please mail me the FAQ list!

   The manuals say that this machine requires MultiFonts CP/M
which was an extension of CP/M 2.2 I believe.

   My question is this :

   (i) Does anyone have a system disc on 5.25 inch floppy - I
       can snail mail a disc for copying onto.

  (ii) Does anyone know where I can ftp the files from - I may
       be able to create a boot disc from another machine if
       someone would tell me the disc format in terms of sector
       and track layout at byte level (I love a hack!)

 (iii) Any other ideas on how to get this machine running?

   Replies via email please (unless you feel that the rest of
Usenet may benefit from the information {8-)

That is interesting, in that I have it running on an XT clone under PC DOS
5.0, but it also does not run properly under DR DOS 6.0 (it reads OK, but 
will not write to the disk) on my AT clone.

I use the Software Toolworks C compiler, I am not sure that the ANSI C Standards

The "Big Board" was a very popular CPM-80 system in the early '80s before the
IBM PC came out.  It is virtually identical wire for wire to the Xerox 820.

I have 98s% of everything, just never built it.  Everything in emaculate
condition.

$150 or best offer.

Big-Board which features:
	Z80 CPU	Board designed for 2.5MHz, most owners ran
			at 4M.  I have all 4M parts.
	Z80 SIO	(2 serial ports, One  will be the console if you
			talk to it first on booting)
	Z80 CTC	Timer Chip
	Z80 PIO	Parallel ports chip.  I think 2 of 'em.
			One used for Console Keyboard if you talk to
			it first on booting.
	1771		Floppy disk controller chip, single density.  See
			below- I have a double density upgrade kit.
	Video		On-board video controller generates 80x25
			character display.
	RAM		64K using 4116s.  I have a 256K expansion
			board, see below.
	ROM Monitor source, both on 8" single sided single density
			floppy and on IBM-PC floppy.
	Documentation
			All original documentation including mulitple
			copies of the bare board to plan and document
			any modification.  Data sheets for all Z80 parts,
			Z80 assembly language manual & reference
			card.
	State of assembly
			All ICs socketed with gold machined contact
			Augat sockets.  90% of passive components
			installed.  Careful record of assembly to date
			following assembly manual and schematic
			with red pencil.  Beautiful job of assembling
			by a perfectionist (me).
		Single in-line sockets were used so you can cut and
		jumper between the pins on the top side of the board.
	Components included
			Almost everything, two of some things.
	Components missing
			No Problems:
			COM 8116 Dual Baud Rate Generator
				Jameco has in stock for $4.95
			74136
			74LS151
			Crystals:  14.31818, 20.0, 5.0688 MHz
				(Need 32MHz XTL to run CPU at 4M)
			Perhaps 10 misc. capacitors
	Data sheets for almost everything, including but not limited
		to all z80 parts, com8116, 1771, 2797.  The rest is
		standard TTL, 4116 DRAM, or 2114 SRAM.
	Modifications
		Modifications were planned for:
			Run at 4MHz
			Fix a video snow problem (faster character
				generator and planned change
				included.  Has been tested elsewhere)
			Change the video XTL frequency and clock
				divider to get a wider display.
		Patches for these may have been started on the
		board, although I am 99% sure they were not.  The
		changes were very simple, and could be backed out
		with a jumper or two using the schematics and
		copies of the bare board.  They will be documented
		if done, and there are probably notes on exactly
		what was planned, but no guarantees.
		Single in-line sockets were used so you can cut and
		jumper between the pins on the top side of the board.

256K expansion board.
	You loose the lower 64K.  I think the software that came
	with it uses it for a RAM disk (floppy comes with).  I have
	a SIG/M disk which is supposed to have Trevor Marshall's
	source to use it for track buffering.

Double Density Kit
	Daughter board for 1771 socket to use 2797.  No software,
	although I assume it should be possible to find similar
	software to do the blocking and deblocking and tweek it for
	this chip.  Data sheets included.

Floppy drives
	Two Shugart 801 single sided 8 inch drives, brand new,
	never out of box.

Video Monitor
	Brand new, never out of box.  Includes schematic.  No case.
	Comes with separate open fram 15v 1A power supply to
	run it.

Keyboard
	Very nice keyboard.  Includes schematic.  Parallel data
	with strobe (which is what big board wants).

Software
	Small C compiler, software to utilize 256K RAM board,
	z80 assembler, misc disks with unknown S/W (On 8 inch
	single density floppies).  IBM-PC floppy with source for
	ROM monitor, small-C, unknown other (it's been a
	long time...).

Power Supplies
	A Xerox 820 supply.  Switching supply with +5, -12, +12.
	I cannot say if this is adequate or not.

	15v 1A for the video display.

	You also need a 24 volt supply for the floppies.

Subject: A Few CP/M Questions
Message-ID: <9205110956.AA26569@LL.MIT.EDU>

Lou Glassy asked a few CP/M questions.

>> --What machines does CP/M68K run on?  Was this a product of

   I don't know very much about this, but there were a couple of Motorola
68000-based computers that had CP/M-68K.  The Sage computer (no relation to
me) was one of them.  I don't think there has been any activity in this area
for many years.

>> --Is CP/M still supported (ie sold, having apps developed for)

   There is still a tremendous amount of activity in the 8-bit CP/M-
compatible computing area.  Most of this centers around Z-System, a modern
replacement for CP/M.  Besides occasional new versions of the operating
system itself, quite a few applications have appeared.  Many new public-
domain programs appear every month and are distributed by bulletin board and
via the Z-System Software Update Service (ZSUS).  There have also been a
number of commercial applications, such as BDS Z (a Z-System version of the
venerable BDS C compiler), ZMATE (a macro text editor derived from PMATE),
and ZMAC (a state-of-the-art macro assembler/linker/librarian package).

   You ask about source code.  I assume you mean for the operating system. 
Disassembled source code for CP/M has been floating around for at least a
decade (but who would want it!).  Source code for versions of ZCPR (which
replaces the CP/M command processor) through 3.3 has been released; the
source code to version 3.4 is available from me as a commercial product. 
There are several BDOS replacements, both public-domain and commercial.  The
PD ones are generally available in source-code form.

Message-ID: <9205110934.AA26182@LL.MIT.EDU>

I think I have given people long enough to express an interest in the
surplus items in the collection of the Zi/Tel Group of the Boston
Computer Society.  This is the last notice I will publish.  These items
can be yours in return for a contribution to help fund user group
activities.  You may communicate an offer in any of the following ways:
 
    (1) by leaving a message on the Zi/Tel BBS in the Boston area
        at 617-965-7046 (or 617-965-7785 to limit access only to the
        USR Courier HST modem on line 2)
    (2) by leaving a message on Jay Sage's Z-Node at 617-965-7259
        (logon password is DDT)
    (3) leaving GEnie mail for JAY.SAGE
    (4) sending email to Jay Sage on Internet at the following
        address: sage@ll.mit.edu
    (5) sending postal mail to Jay Sage at
                1435 Centre Street
                Newton, MA 02159-2469

The email methods (first four methods above) would be best.  When it
comes time to send money, send a check payable to "BCS ZI/TEL" to the
Newton Centre address listed above.

Now for the inventory of items!
 
                +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

The hard-sectored diskettes for NorthStar computers have all been spoken
for, but there are still some other hard-sector diskettes available.
 
     18   boxes of 8" 32-sector hard-sector diskettes
      7   boxes of 5.25" 16-sector hard-sector diskettes
 
                 +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

Some of the miscellaneous hardware remains.  Much of it will be
discarded or stripped for parts very soon.
 
     1    Soroc 135 terminal
     1    Kaypro that needs work (loose connector in power supply is
            part of problem, certainly good for parts)
     1    mint condition Kaypro 2 with ComRiter diasy-wheel
            printer, original manuals
     1    Osborne 1, condition unknown

These items probably make sense only for people in the greater Boston
area who can pick them up from me.  I took the broken Kaypro down to
Trenton, but the person who had asked for it never showed up to claim
it.  I am about to pull out the disk drives and chuck the rest.
 
                 +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

There are still quite a few copies of WordStar 3.30 and MailMerge 3.31
in sealed, shrink-wrapped boxes, originally for Apple CP/M.  Many
copies already found their way to new homes with satisfied owners.  The
rest will soon be given to the trash collectors.  There might be a few
other MicroPro items left.
 
                 +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

There are still a few application paks for the HP-41 calculator.  I
don't remember which they are.  Ask if you have any interest.

                 +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

Someone at Trenton took one copy of each of the Sony SMC-70 software
packages.  These are probably not worth the cost of shipping anywhere,
but if you have an interest, now is the time to speak up.  I am going to
throw away the remaining copies at my next opportunity (perhaps after
pulling out the 3.5" diskettes for reuse and seeing if the binders could
be put to any good use).

Message-ID: <9205110923.AA26051@LL.MIT.EDU>

   Last Friday I called Micro Solutions to ask about the problem of running
Uniform under MS-DOS 5.  What they told me is that the current version,
2.17, fully supports MS-DOS 5.  However, it does not, and probably never
will, run under DR DOS 6.  Updates to the current version can be obtained by
sending an original distribution diskette along with a check for $18 to

        Technical Support Department
        Micro Solutions, Inc.
        132 West Lincoln Highway
        DeKalb, IL  60115

They told me to be sure to include a note indicating what I was asking for
and giving my address and phone number.

   Since I am using DR DOS 6, I decided to experiment with 22DISK instead. 
As far as I can tell, it runs perfectly (can anyone else confirm this).  I
suppose that this is typical of shareware: way ahead of the commercial
houses.  However, 22DISK, like MediaMaster, does not do what Uniform does. 
One can only format diskettes and copy files to and from the foreign-format
diskette.  Uniform turns the foreign-format drive into a virtual DOS drive
on which one can use whatever tools one wishes.

Who makes a 64 emulator for DOS?  I know of one for the Amiga, which was 
fairly successful, except when trying to load a protected program that used 
the 1541's programmability to prevent copying.  But I wasn't aware of a 64 
emulator for DOS.  Of course, even if there were one, there's no way a DOS 
disk can read a 64 disk (MFM vs. GCR).

Actually, CP/M 2.2 logs in drive A because it needs to read
the CCP (and possibly BDOS) from the boot tracks.  Perhaps
a better way to handle it would be to modify your BIOS so
that you can change the physical to logical drive mapping.
Then, assuming that you can sysgen the RAM disk, you could
have a startup EX or ZEX script that would sysgen your RAM
disk and remap it as drive A.

The TurboBIOS for the Kaypro allows you to do this -- warm-
booting from the RAM disk is so quick you won't believe it.

You could also alter your BIOS so that it would read the
system tracks from your RAM disk instead of drive A.  The
problem here is to sysgen the RAM disk BEFORE a warmboot
occurs or you'll hang your system.  Then instead of always
accessing drive A, the CCP would just relog the current
default drive.

No. There are two different things here: Warm-boot and logging in. The
warm-boot (reading CCP, BDOS and perhaps even the BIOS from the boot
track) are done internally to the BIOS. If you have source to your
BIOS (or if you wrote it yourself), you can modify such that it
warmboots from any other drive (for example in my system, I can set
the boot disk to any disk in the system, frequently I set it to drive
C). Second, the BDOS will "log in" (read and decode the directory,
build the ALV) a drive whenever you start it (which is usually after
each warm-boot, although newer BDOS replacements can bypass this with
a fast relog option). Even though I am warmbooting from drive C, the
BDOS will still log in drive A. Now it gets even crazier: Assume I am
booting from drive C, and my current working drive is B (I have set
the current drive at address 0004h to "B" within the startup code for
example). The BDOS will still log in drive A after each warmboot! The
annoying thing is that even though I never need drive A I still have
to have a functional and readable drive connected there.

Lesson: Warmbooting is done internally to your BIOS. You may or may
not be able to tell your BIOS to boot from a drive other than A.  You
have a current working disk, stored at location 0004h. The BDOS will
always log in drive A when being started.

That's the way to do it. If you don't like drive A being accessed
all the time, declare your favorite drive to be A instead.

Hey Scott,

	Depends which Morrow terminal you have!!  They had three of them.
One is a ADM 20/22, one a Zenith Green screen, and one a newer Zenith gold
screen.  Hence the keyboards are all interchangable with their counterparts!!
I'm not sure of the Zenith terminal models but they are both very common!!!

If you need info please yell.  My father was the Morrow dealer in Indiana and
I grew up with these machines.  I also have complete service manauls for all
of them!!!

In general I have heard a lot of good about 22DISK (I am a registered owner),
but I personally have had a *LOT* of trouble using it with the Xerox 820 series
of computers (specifically the 820-II).  My current 386 (which has a
Compaticard IV for the floppy controller) works better with 22DISK than my old
286 did, but still does not work to my satisfaction.

I have heard of plenty of other people who have had no problem using 22DISK
with Xerox 820-II floppy disks though.  I have had no trouble with other floppy
formats that I have needed to use.  The thing I like best about 22DSIK is that
you can add disk formats to it, just by telling it the parameters.

On the other hand, I have never had a problem with UNIFORM and Xerox 820-II
floppies (on the same two computers).  I have a real old copy though, and
suspect I will shortly be getting their latest version.

Message-ID: <us92mINN54e@cs.utexas.edu>

I just got a machine called an Exxon Series 500 Information Processor.
I suppose, strictly speaking, it is not a CP/M machine, although it does
use a Z-80 and lots of other Zilog parts, so I'm posting this here.

The machine tries to run, but instead of starting up the word processing
software it seems to be dumping me out into some kind of diagnostic
monitor.  Here is what comes up on the screen:

ESOC SERIES 500 OPERATING SYSTEM   ID: AK0006.1H

RESET
 EXOS V BV0h

>

If I type a D at the prompt I get:

0D85 0BD5 C3FB 0B80 6008 0584 8181 2684

I can also type  G xxxx where xxxx is a hex number and it apparently tries
to execute whatever it finds at that address.  I can get it to reboot by
entering  G 0.  Entering  G 0584 (yes, I tried all the "addresses" I got
from D) seems to put it into some kind of memory inspection/modification
mode, something like DDT.

So, can anyone tell me about this machine?  Anyone have any technical specs?
Or (here's hoping) anyone have a CP/M boot disk for it?  :)  It looks like
a really well built piece of hardware and I'd hate to have to just
dismantle it for parts.  It has 64K of memory on board, and empty sockets
which lead me to believe it should be expandable to 256K.  (I did get the
operating manual and it mentions a 128K version.)  Any info beyond the
standard operations, or communications manuals would be helpful.

SBC-1200 computer.  It runs CP/M.  We seem to have legitimate
copies of DataStar and ReportStar, but the reference manuals (if
any existed) have disappeared.  We do have a couple of
introductory or tutorial manuals. 

We have an existing machine-readable database which is stored in
a flat file format, and we would like to import that data into
DataStar so that we can use that product to maintain the
database.  The introductory manuals were good enough that we were
able to successfully create a new test database and we have had
no difficulty adding or updating records in the test database. 

However, all of our previous attempts to import old data without
retyping it have failed.  We are hoping someone on the net will
help us out with the following. 

1.  DataStar appears to have a feature to allow "batch" entry
    files to be merged with the main database, but it appears to
    require that the "batch" entry file have been created with
    DataStar.  When we experimented with using that feature to merge
    non-DataStar files, DataStar either erased the file or decided
    that there were no records in them. 
    
    Does DataStar have a mechanism for importing data from external
    (i.e. non-DataStar) files? 

2.  We could probably reformat the existing database to fool DataStar
    into treating it as a native DataStar database, but we don't know
    the correct format.

    Is there publically accessible information describing the
    format of the data and index files?  There does not seem to be
    any particular magic to DataStar data files--it looks like
    records are <cr>-delimited and fields are comma-delimited.
    However, I haven't been able to figure out the either the format
    of the index files or the way the index fields are calculated. 
    
Any help would be appreciated.  Perhaps there are other ways to
import the data we haven't thought of.   Please mail responses
to me.

Thanks!

I have just finished building a Ram Drive for my S-100.

The Ram Drive is FAST. Unfortunately, I've found a nasty 
piece of trivia about CP/M; there is a BDOS function that
resets the drive system. (0DH, I think.) It logs all the
drives out, sets the DMA to 80H, and then logs drive A
back in. Since drive A is a 5-1/4" floppy, this is slow
compared to logging in the Ram Drive.

What I would like to do is patch the BDOS so that it logs
Drive E in after reseting the drive system, does anyone know
how to do this. (I can't trace the call because DDT chokes
when you try to trace the BDOS.)

I am running CP/M 2.2.

I have a NorthStar Advantage purchased at a swap meet for ten bucks.
I came with the monitor, 2 disk drives and keyboard in one unit.
It did not come with a operating system, software or disks.

Does anyone know of a users group in Southern California that I may
contact to get a operating system and disks.  I would very much like
to get this old machine running.

Thank you,

Message-ID: <1992May16.113956.3197@vax1.umkc.edu>

Has anyone used CPM and Wordstar on a Franklin Ace 2200, Apple IIe/c compat? 
Will it even work? I was recently given such a machine and want to move to it
from an Apple II+. I have a Microsoft CPM/Z80 Softcard for the Apple and need
to know if it will work in the Franklin.  Will I need to set any jumpers and in
what slot, 2, 5 or 4/7?  One slot is labled 4/7 and seems to be selected by a
jumper.  I don't have any documentation for the Franklin.

Subject: Looking for VT100 emulator in Z80 source
Keywords: Z80 terminal emulator vt100 source
Message-ID: <3693.volker@sfb256.iam.uni-bonn.de>

Hello all!

   I have this old Z80 computer gathering dust that I used to run CP/M
on long ago.  It's a Sharp MZ80B, with 64 KB RAM and a 24x80 screen
built in, two serial ports and several other extras.

   It occurred to me that I could use it as an extra terminal, so here's
my question:  Does anyone have Z80 assembler source for a VT100
emulation?  I don't want to run it off floppy disks, so it must be Z80
assembler.  The terminal emulator will either run in ROM, or I'll load
it from cassette tape.

   I haven't done any Z80 work for years, and I'd rather not write the whole
thing from scratch, so I'm grateful for any source that might be out there.
The CP/M BIOS did emulate a terminal called ADM3A, and I have source to the
complete BIOS, so I just might mangle that.  But I don't really know all the
escape sequences for the VT100, either.

  Anyone out there able to help?  Please reply by email.

  Thanks a lot in advance -- Volker

Perfect Filer is a database that runs under CP/M and I need to export a
Perfect Filer database to a DOS file (eventually to Filemaker Pro on the Mac.)

The problem:  The database is running on a KayPro 10 micro (under CP/M) with a
10MB disk and 360K floppy.  The Perfect Filer manual ((c) 1983) does not mention
anything about exporting databases and Berkeley CA does not have a phone number

P.S.  My situation is compliated by the database being 1.6MB in total size. 
The MUFBAR program used to back it up splits to files across many disks when
backed up.  I could write a C program that would extract the data from the
MUFBAR file, but I am looking for a more reliable method.

Check in Computer Shopper. There's a company still supporting the
beast. You can get parts, upgrades, an 8088 board w/ MSDOS 2.0
and a hard drive. They sell DBASE, Wordstar, etc. Look in the
classified section.

Polytechnic University in Brooklyn still uses them in their
undergrad Hardware Torture Lab (they're cheap & expendable) &
the local Northstar User's Group meets there. They might be a
good source too.

I have/can get software for the beast. I also have full manuals.
These are some of my favorite CP/M machines.

The best suggestion that I can offer is to get the package that contains
PF2ASC.COM from SIMTEL20 archives.  As the name suggests, it will convert a
PF database into a 'comma delimited' ASCII file which should be easy to import
into a foreign database program.  It is available under
             pd:<cpm.kaypro>pf2asc.lbr.

>o  Get a phone number for KayPro systems.
>
Kaypro's phone number is (619) 535-2155.  However, they are a skeleton outfit
now, that is devoted to PC clones, and I doubt that they can be of much help.

<Looking up from working on CP/M ZIP & UNZIP>

If you're using WordStar 4.0 under CP/M, ^QU (Quick Unformat is my 
favorite description for this one). [NOTE: That is control Q U] You might
want to hit a ^B (control B) as I don't recall if it reformats 
paragraphs correctly.

If, however, you are using an earlier version of WordStar, stripping
the eigth bit of each byte in the file works just fine. Here's an
easy method using PIP:
 
   PIP NEWFILE.NAM=OLDFILE.NAM[Z]

NOTE: You'd NEVER want to do this to a binary file (like .COM) for
obvious reasons! :)

There is a program called FILT (latest version 8.2) by the late Irv Hoff
that will solve your problem.  I would expect you will find it among the
archives on the Internet, but if not I will gladly send you a copy.

Does anyone still use word star on CP/M?  If so, does anyone know how to
remove the formatting char at the end of each word.  I would like to convert
an existing document into a straight ascii file.  Word Star puts an escape

I do know that you can work with non-documented files to eliminate future
problems, but is there a way to convert the file back to ascii?  I believe
all I need to do is unformat (^B reformats), but how????

It's been 8 years since I touched CP/M, can you tell?!!!

I'm told there is a program called "Uniform", allowing a CP/M box to
emulate other soft-sectored formats.  Anyone know anything about it?

I have one of the fine old Kaypro 4-83 "portable" available to a good home.
Plenty of software, both commercial and public domain.  Works fine and
stillmakes a good word processor and telecommunications terminal.

I'll entertain offers, but mostly want to see someone use it.  If you're a
non-profit or similar worthy cause, you can have it for the cost of
shipping.

Let me know -- it's time to move and I really don't ned it anymore.

Subject: CPM to DOS data transfer
Message-ID: <1992May29.192041.17628@msc.cornell.edu>

We have some data on two Z80 CPM machines that are being phased out in
favor of 386 DOS machines.  We need to get some of the data from the
160K cpm disks to DOS disks.  The two CPM machines are an Osborne and
a Phillips.  We have Kermit for the Osborne and can transfer the data
from there at 1200 baud over serial line but would rather not.  The
Phillips has no kermit and the Osborne kermit doesn't work on it.  Any
ideas? (even if they cost money)

Subject: OS for Tektronix 4170???
Message-ID: <1992May28.034121.27716@wam.umd.edu>

I have had this tek 4170, and 4105 terminal for over a year now.  I am only
using the terminal to call into the net, but the 4170 seems to be running
its self test all the way to the point where I should insert the OS disk.

thats where I run into trouble because I dont have my OS disk.  I called
Tek, and they want $295 (might as well be a thousand!) for a new disk and       manual.  I cant afford that!
so I was hoping someone out here had a suggestion... I could really
use this computer (I mean its impressive to look at and all... but it would 
really be nice if it worked).

Any help would be appreciated.

					thanks in advance,

  It was a commercial package marketed for the Kaypro, and perhaps
some others.   I don't know if it's still around (Jay Sage, are you out
there?)

  There is an MSDOS version available from a company called Microsolutions
in DeKalb, Illinois.  I got my copy from Emerald Microware in Beaverton, 
Oregon when I was down there a few years ago .. I still make fairly
constant use of it...

Dave, that is correct.  In fact, there are versions for various CP/M machines
and another called UniForm-PC for PC compatibles.  They are products of:

                Micro Solutions, Inc.
                132 West Lincoln Hwy.
                DeKalb IL 60115
                (815) 756-3411
 
Be advised, however, that because of the variations from one CP/M machine to
another, only the most popular of them had a version tailored to them.

                                                 - don

The Vector machine doesn't boot (drive A seems to be inoperable), and
the rest of the boards are from who knows what system.  Any information
on these cards and how to put them togeather into a working system would
be greatly appreciated.
