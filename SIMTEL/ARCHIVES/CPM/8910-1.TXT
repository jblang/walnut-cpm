Subject: Altos 580 software wanted

I just bought a used Altos 580-10A, which now seems to contain a Rodime
203E hard disk (20 megs?)

Here's the rub: I don't have any documentation on this box, nor any
software except what was already on the hard disk (a pharmacy package
running under P-system).

I am looking for at least a CP/M system (bootable) diskette for the 580.
Any technical or service manuals would also be appreciated.

Thanks in advance,
Andy

Subject: DecMate II/CPM problem

Hello. I just picked up a DEC DecMate II w/ CPM 2.2 very cheaply a couple of
days ago. The system works with some sort of word processing program which is
included, however, when I boot up the CPM installation disk, it won't let me
install or backup the CPM. I've tried some generic disks, along with Memorex
SSDD/DSDD disks. On all of them, I get a 'Disk upside down error on track 2,
sector 1'. This happens even though the disk is in correctly (When it's in 
upside down, I get the error on T0,S0, like I should). Oh, the system software
was on a disk labelled RX50, although some of it was on 3M disks labelled 
'RX50 compatible' or somesuch. Any ideas as to why this happens would be 
appreciated.

I have a quantity of Hitachi HD64180 single-board computers available.
Each contains the cpu, 64k dynamic RAM (can take 256k), socket for
JEDEC rom, 1 half-duplex synchronous port, and 2 rs232 ports (up to
38.4kbaud).  I also have a CP/M based assembler for the '180, and a
bunch of code developed (like ISR's for the serial ports, a serial to
Dataproducts 2230 converter, an async-sync-async converter).  Each
board comes with a wall transformer type power supply.

This board is ideal for a dedicated protocol converter or something
like that.

Well, I have this Sanyo MBC-1000 that I >>NEED<< to get rid of.
It takes up approx 7 or 8 feet of shelf space for the computer, the
documentation, and the disks.  I have no room no more.

So, it has a dual 8" drive, and about 100 8" disks with TONS of stuff
on them.  3 word processors, dungeon, spaceout, another game or two.
a spreadsheet program.  An Intel 8051 ( 8032, etc... ) xross assembler.
the bios source code ( I think there are 3 machines worth here), and lots of 
assembler jems for lots of interesting projects.

Also, there are lots of manuals for the beast. ( including a rash of
schematics )

I now work with a VAX computer, and just don's see myself using this anymore.

   As a Boston Computer Society resource person, I have been asked by
someone for a telecommunications program for the NEC APC-2 computer,
which has 8" disk drives.  I can make the diskette, but so far I have
not located an overlay for MDM740, IMP, or MEX.  I did find a MEX
overlay for an 8815 computer, but I do not know if that overlay will
work on an APC-2.  Any advice would be appreciated.  If there is someone
out there with this computer and an already-working telecomm program, I
would greatly appreciate it if you would be willing to send a disk
directly to your fellow user.  Let me know and I will send his address.

Subject: Z80 algorithms

The Z80 processor is known to be one of the cheapest processors in the world,
but alas it is also known to be NOT one of the fastest. The more I am
interested in fast assembler coded algorithms to avoid unnecessary waiting
periods.

The algorithms I'm interested in are relatively elementary: 16 bit
multiplication, 16 bit division, 32 bit arithmetics, filling an arbitraray
amount of storage with a given bit pattern, conversion of ascii encoded numbers
to binary and vice versa, conversion from binary to hexadecimal notation, etc.

Well, I do have such algorithms; but I wonder if they can be made faster. Does
there exist a collection of such algorithms I can access? (I don't have access
to anonymous ftp.)

I'm watching this newsgroup since last winter, and I haven't seen one article
on this subject. Or do I watch the wrong newsgroup?	:-|

If there is someone who wants to send me some of those algorithms, please
don't mail them, please post them: I could bet there are some people out there
in netland who are interested, too.  :-)

Waiting patiently ... Thanks in advance,

Does CP/M require a hardware option on the DECmate II?  If so, make sure you
have said option.  It might also be that the disks need to be formatted in
some way, and the ones you have aren't or had been recycled for some other
use that blew the formatting.

 I have just such a thing.  I wrote a limited NULU clone for MSDOS
called ALU, and I included the Turbo C 1.5 source code as well.  It
*doesn't* support CRC checking (due to the fact that when I wrote

Georg-
   There's a pretty good book on the subject called "Z80 Assembly Language
Routines" by Lance Leventhal and Winthrop Saville (Osborne/McGraw-Hill,
Berkeley, 1983).  I don't know if it's still in print (soft-bound), but
perhaps you could find it in a good library??  It presents assembly language
fragments with descriptive text in chapters with titles such as:  "code
conversion", "string manipulation", "arithmetic", "bit manipulation and
shifts", etc.  I can't vouch for the relative speed of these algorithms,
but it certainly could be a good place to start!  If you are interested
in floating point arithmetic, there's not much here.  You might then try
looking at a dis-assembled BASIC or f.p. math libraries from a Z80 "C"
compiler??  Any help with f.p. out there????

Unfortunately, REL.MCD cannot be made into a runnable .COM file.  The
REL.MCD for the unreleased TM2 1.1 is supposed to ba able to be made
into a COM file.  I ran across a reference to this on the old Echelon
ZNODE Central some time back.

Have you tried the simple example in the TM2 Reference Manual?  I was
able to .REL'ify it without difficulty with my Kaypro (57.25 K TPA).

My best suggestion is make sure that you have as much free memory as
possible.  Boot the bare minimum system that you can -- no TSR-type
programs, DateStamper, Z-System, externally loaded drivers, or 
what-have-you.  Then try again.

If that fails, perhaps you find a CP/M machine with a bigger TPA that
you can use to generate the .REL files.  A CP/M 3.0 machine might 
work well.

Subject: Turb Modula 2 problems

I can speak with some authority on Turbo Modula.

The REL.MCD module CANNOT be linked to a COM file.  It needs to have
been originally written to do so, and it wasn't.

Even when it does run properly (under the TM2 shell as a MCD file), it
requires copious amounts of TPA to convert even one REL link item.  It
has been a few years since I researched it, but I seem to recall it
needed a 51k or 54k TPA system just to process a trivial REL file.  I
can run it fine on my 57k TPA DT42 Hyperspace Z-system.

Try running it under vanilla cp/m (if using z-system).

I am in the process of interfacing a Shugart SA 801 drive to a Cromemco

consistent with that of the SA 801; Cromemco apparently adopted a non-

jumpers and trace cuts, which I have followed.  I have had some success, 
but have questions about the error messages printed by the ROM monitor

First of all I would like to publicly thank Bob Turner for
his help in getting this  machine up and running..

I still need some basic help in getting things working and maybe
someone ( with an Osborne 1 ) could help.
I don't know alot about ports, etc. but I would like to use
a modem with the Osborne 1. I know that you have to reverse the
2 and 3 pins on the rs 232 to make a modem work there and I 
have done that.  I can get it to work but the dtr light doesn't
come on and the modem functions, such as autodial, doesn't work.
 Can I hook up to the 9 pin modem port?
 Instead of the rs 232  port?
Another question,  I want to hook up a cheap monitor ( TV ) if
possible.  Can someone tell me what would be the cheapest
alternative.  I do have the 80 column upgrade, but when I have
tried to use a ext monitor, the top and bottom are off the screen!

That should hold me for now..

Subject: Wanted - information on the Mostek 3801

I'm posting this to comp.os.cpm, since the question relates to a chip in
my Televideo 803 CP/M machine. If anyone can recommend a better newsgroup
to post to, please do so. Followups will go to comp.sources.wanted, or
you can just E-mail them to me.

The serial I/O chip in the Televideo 803 appears to be a hybrid cross
between a CTC, PIO, and SIO, all in one package: the Mostek 3801. As
delivered, the cpu has to poll the chip to receive incoming characters.
I would like to write a serial driver that uses interrupts, but I haven't
been able to find how to get the chip to generate an interrupt. I have
run tests with all the vectors in the interrupt table filled in, but my
suspicion is that I have to set a bit somewhere in a register to allow
the chip to generate interrupts for received characters.

Any ideas, hints, information, anything????

Big deal! Use a 64180 (aka Z180) chip, has the MLT instruction, takes 17
clock cycles, or 1.85 micro seconds.  (By the way: it's a 2-byte instruction)

Zilog, having flubbed the Z280 project for so many years, was mortally
embarrassed by Hitachi's excellent 64180 chip (and even more excellent 1-chip
version, the 647180).  Thus they made a deal to market the 64180 under the
pseudonym Z180.  The 64180 is far more than a 'Z80 clone'. It does support
the Z80 instruction set, but has 2 asynch and 1 synch serial ports, 1 Meg
address space, 2 16-bit timers, and 4 external interrupt lines.

Bigger deal!! Use a Z280 and do *16* bit multiplies (signed AND unsigned)
in 25 or so clcok cycles.  Also divide! (32 bits / 16 bits).
Also 2-byte instructions.  Unless you want to do something like:
	HL := DEHL DIV (IX+2345H)

Subj: Re: Wanted - information on the Mostek 3801

Since that thing is a really beautifull chip (weird what turns one on), I'll
post a short description.

Mostek 3801 Z80STI (Serial Timer Interrupt), contains one full-duplex USART
with baud rate generator, 8 bit parallel IO with timers, and full interrupt
controller (Z80 compatible).

I will omit all the timers, since that gets really complicated, and you would
probably need the data sheet to make sense of it. Also, the break generation
and loopback mode of the USART will be skipped over:

It has four address lines, so 16 registers are directly addressable. 8 other
registers are indirectly addressable.

First the directly adressable ones (put address on A0-A3 and strobe):

0 IDR   Indirect Data Register. To use an indirect register, write it's address
        into the lowest three bits of the PVR (port ?), then access the
        content of the requested indirect register through here.
1 GPIP  General Purpose IO Interrupt. This is actually the parallel data
        register. Read from it to determine the status of the 8 parallel input
        lines, write to it to set their level. See the AER and DDR register for
        setting the up I/O and defining their registers.
2 IPRB  Interrupt Pending Register B. The bits in here are set if interrupt
        channel 8-F have an interrupt request pending.
3 IPRA  Interrupt Pending Register A. The bits in here are set if interrupt
        channel 0-7 have an interrupt request pending.
4 ISRB  Interrupt in Service Register B. The bits in here are set if interrupt
        channel 8-F have an interrupt request currently in service. To end an
        interrupt service, write a word with all ones, except a zero for the
        interrupt channel you want to end the service on.
5 ISRA  Interrupt in Service Register A. The bits in here are set if interrupt
        channel 0-7 have an interrupt request currently in service. To end an
        interrupt service, write a word with all ones, except a zero for the
        interrupt channel you want to end the service on.
6 IMRB  Interrupt Mask Register B. If any bit in here is cleared, the
        corresponding interrupt channel 8-F is temporarily masked. Interrupts
        can still become pending, bit will not go to the CPU.
7 IMRA  Interrupt Mask Register A.If any bit in here is cleared, the
        corresponding interrupt channel 0-7 is temporarily masked. Interrupts
        can still become pending, bit will not go to the CPU.

        1 bit Clock divider: Set for /16, clear for /1.
D RSR   Receiver Status Register. Contains the following bits (LSB first):
        - Receiver Enable. Clear this bit to disable the receiver.
        - Sync strip. Set this bit, and sync characters will not be loaded into
          the receive buffer. Also no buffer full or match signals will be
          generated.
        - Match / Character in Progress. In sync mode this is set whenever the
          sync character is received. In async mode this is set whenever a
          character is currently being shifted in.
        - Break. Set in async mode if break is detected.
        - Found/Search. Set this bit in sync mode if you want to hunt for the
          sync word in the data stream.
        - Frame error. Set in async mode if the stop bit was missing.
        - Parity error. Set if the word received had the wrong parity.
        - Overrun error. Set if a ward was received, but the receive buffer was
          full.
        - Buffer full. Set if there is a word waiting to be grabbed from the
          receive buffer.
E TSR   Transmitter Status Register. Contains the following bits (LSB first):
        - Transmitter enable. Clear this bit to disable the transmitter output.
          Also used for break generation.

          and loopback.
        - High. Set for normal operation. Clear for special effects with break
          and loopback.
        - Break. Set this to generate a break. This will create create a
          transmitter error !
        - End. This gets set at the end of the character being transmitted if
          you disable the transmitter in the middle of a character.
        - Auto turnaround. Set this bit to put the USART into loopback mode.
          You have to manually enable and disable transmitter and receiver.
        - Underrun error. Set if there was nothing to transmit. Usually you
          can ignore this error.
        - Buffer empty. Set when you can write a word into the transmit buffer.
F UDR   USART Data Register.

And the indirectly addressable ones (see under IDR and PVR about how to access
them:

0 SCR   Sync Character Register. Use in synchroneous mode of the USART.
1 TDDR  Timer D Data Register.
2 TCDR  Timer C Data Register.
3 AER   Active Edge Register. This register determines on which edge of a
        transition on the parallel input line a General Purpose interrupt will
        be generated: Bit set for the 0-1 transition, bit clear for the 1-0
        transition. You should configure the AER before enabling interrupts
        using IERA and IERB.
4 IERB  Interrupt Enable Register B. Set any bit in here to enable interrupts

The push-algorithm is good for memory fill patterns when the pattern itself
is of a particular variety and is of a fixed length.

The LDIR algorithm works for any pattern of length.  You load the pattern
once, with:

	 hl-> beginning of memory area
	 de-> beginning of memory area + pattern_length
	 bc ==  fill_length - pattern length

You then load your pattern starting at (HL) ONCE with a sequence that gets
it from the source (wherever it comes from).

Then you LDIR it.

If the fill length is less than pattern length, this can be tested when
being loaded manually the "first (and only) time".

This generalization of the 1-byte case (presented at the top of this
article) is a fast way of loading variable-length patterns, AND it can be
interrupted.  Byte count is small too.

Just depends on your needs :-).

Someone mailed to me the following memory fill algorithm:

There exists a much faster faster algorithm for that. Let's see:

The central statement in your solution is `ldir'. It takes 21 T states per
byte. For 16 bytes this is 336 T states.

Using the push statement is much faster:
	Set D = E = the byte to be filled in;
	let SP point 1 byte after the end of the area to be filled;
	B contains the number of 16 byte blocks to be filled.
Then use "push DE"s, and you're finished very quickly.

	DI			; CP/M must not interrupt, because SP will be
				; misused
	LD	(sp_save),SP	; save current SP value
	LD	SP,HL		; assuming HL points to <end+1>
L:	PUSH	DE		; 8 times, so 16 bytes are filled
	PUSH	DE
	PUSH	DE
	PUSH	DE
	PUSH	DE
	PUSH	DE
	PUSH	DE
	PUSH	DE
	DJNZ	L		; a 16 byte portion has been processed.
	LD	SP,(sp_save)	; restore the SP
	EI			; done

This way you can fill up to 4096 (256*16) bytes. If more bytes are to be
filled, build a loop around it. If the number of the bytes to be filled isn't a
multiple of 16, the bytes 1 to 15 can be filled straight forward with a
traditional algorithm.

The timing of that algorithm: The central loop starts at "L:" and ends with
"DJNZ". "push DE" needs 11 T states; DJNZ needs 13 ones. So for 16 bytes to be
filled you get: 

	8 * 11 + 13 = 101

	101 / 336 = 30 %

Relatively fast, isn't it? And -- it works!

PS: The idea isn't mine, I found it some time ago in a journal. I'm sorry I
don't remember which one it was.

OK, but then You'll loose Z80 compatibility (unless I'm wrong)!
You might as well take the NS32K, that gives You
multiply, divide, remainder in all sorts of data types (signed,
unsigned, float) and sized (byte, word, double, float, long)

It was not originally made by Zilog (i.e. developped) but Zilog probably
found it a neat chip (which it is) and it fitted nicely in their range,
so they second-sourced it and named it the Z180.

That's all folks.

What you need is a nice S180 board with one.  Actually, I recall that the
Micro Mint used to have one.  Pretty cheap too.  I don't know if they're

  No, you and the count with 17(8) and then jump into the loop so you

Following from a trade rag that appears in my in-basket every so often
in the 'products to watch' section.

Zilog has announced Z80 higher-integration follow-ons and family
of data controllers.  higher integration: Z84013/84C13 -- serial i/o,
counter/timer.  Z84015/84C15 -- add parallel i/o, power-on reset,
2 chip-select pins, error-detection circuitry.  data comms: Z16C35 --
programmable bus arch, 4 DMA controllers, 3Mbit/s data transfer rate.
Z16C33 -- monochannel universal serial controller, SDLC support.

Don't know anything more about these chips than you see paraphrased
above, but it looks as if the 64180 on-chip integration cues have
been taken...

This sounds like a trivial answer, but the details are not:
Simply 8-{) write a new BIOS / change Your existing BIOS.
If nobody else can help You, I have the source code for a BIOS which
supports SCSI hard disks. I might dig into it to find the exact
mechanism to switch from floppy to hard-disk.

Subject: Turbo Modula-2 REL prob

My sincere thanks to all those who responded to my query regarding
getting the REL utility in Turbo Modula-2 to work properly. To
summarize; REL cannot be linked to a .COM file, and requires something
greater than a 58K CP/M system to function, no matter how small the
original assembler source. I have a stripped down floppy-only 61K system 
that does the job even on a 1500 line assembler program. Now if I could
only get around having to reboot from floppy ever time I change
something in the assembler module... TM2 is slooooow on floppies!
 
To all those who wonder just what I was up to (including a reply from, I 
believe, Sweden!), I was attempting to get the planetarium program, SKY
v3.2, running on my Ampro with a homebrew V9938 graphics card. I am
happy to report success. Since my system supports grey-scale or colour
graphics, I've extended the program to display the star magnitudes as
different shades of gray, which looks quite nice. I also managed to get
a Kraft micromouse hooked up and working, which was considerably easier
than I had anticipated. And in a fit of inspiration, I buckled down and
figured out how to use a sprite for the arrow pointer. All in all, a
wonderful learning experience, lots of fun, and a remarkably useful
program to boot.
 
However (there's _always_ a however!), the time required to recalculate
the positions of the 2000+ stars, planets and galaxies in the database
is quite noticeable; about 3.5 minutes. Given the amout of floating
point trig calculations required for each star, it's understandable, but 
I'd like it to be faster, if possible, without giving in and buying an
AT.
 
Has anyone had experience with interfacing floating point processors to
a Z80 based system? If so, I'd appreciate hearing about your
experiences, pro or con. So far, I've investigated the possibility of
hooking up an 8088/8087 pair. The 8087 uses a real number format very
similar to the IEEE format used by TM2. The only difference I've
encountered so far is a difference of 1 in the biasing of the exponent.
This does not seem to be a difficult problem in conversion, as far as
I've been able to tell, but I don't know what else is available out
there.
 
So; any suggestions?

You CAN get a nice system with the 64180 on it:
The Micromint/Ciarcia's Circuit Cellar SB180(FX)
It features:
	- HD64180 (with the interfaces: 2xserial, timers, dma, mmu)
	- 256 kB memory (FX has 512 kB, externally extendable to 2Megs)
	- floopy controller for 8", 5.25" (and 3.5")
	- parallel interfaces (CENTRONICS AND a 8255)
	- SCSI chip (FX only)
	- EPROM with monitor
You can oder it with the Zsystem (CPM2.2 compatible but A LOT NICER)
costs about $500.

Add to this the GT180:
	- piggy backs onto SB180(FX)
	- high resolution: (standard is 640x480 but I ran it on a
	  Mutlisync II)
	- Uses HD63484 ACRTC -> LINE, RECTANGLE, CIRCLE, ELLIPSE, ...
	- RGBI/TTL or 16 out of 4096 colors analog
Makes You another $500 poorer, but ITS GREAT!!!

Give Micromint a ring: 1-(800)635-3355 or 1-(203)-871-6170

NOTE: I AM IN NO WAY CONNECTED TO MICROMINT APART FROM BEING VERY HAPPY
      WITH THE SB180FX/GT180

Not really. QTERM assumes nothing about the machine it's running
on, so it can't do the work.

>  Can I just extend the Termcap.

The termcap is designed to be put on a UNIX machine to configure it to
send codes that QTERM can make sense of. The problem with running in
VT100 mode is that escapes (and most other control characters) get
intercepted, so it's next to impossible to go behind the back of it
to get at the grafix on your Kaypro.

>  Is the termcap used?

Not by QTERM itself. If you have a UNIX machine, there is a way of putting
a termcap in a file, and using that instead of /etc/termcap. If you can
do that, then you'd be all set: just create a termcap entry for the Kaypro
itself. If you're not on a UNIX machine then there's not much to do, unless
the system has _SOME_ mechanism for configuring for other terminals.

Subject: Submit operation under CP/M 3.0

dear david,
the usage of SUBMIT under CP/M-3 is as easy as if you started the
programs directly. Under CP/M-3 it is possible to set the "Search Order"
to contain .SUB files, that means, when you type a command and then hit
"return", the system will search for files "command.COM" and "command.SUB",
in the order you previously defined. If a SUB file is found, SUBMIT.COM
is automatically loaded and the batchfile will be processed immediately.
You have nothing to do except typing the command with its parameters,
just as you would do with an executable COM file. Isn't that nice?

If you are the lucky owner of something called RAM-Disk (perhaps non-
volatile?), then you can increase system performance by having SUBMIT.COM
and all often-used SUB files in it. Then you set the "Drive Search Chain"
for the system to look at the ram-disk first before attempting to access 
the physical drives. After that, you just wonder how you could ever work
without it.

Use the NS32081 FPU. This chip is designed for the NS32000 family but
its interface is general enough to work with any cpu. It does not depend 
in any way on unique features of the 32000. You will have a lot of grief 
trying to interface an 8087 or 287 to any non-Intel chip, and not much
less problem with the MC68881. But an interface for the 32081 can be
done in 3-4 TTL chips or one PAL. National themselves publish an
application note (I have a copy - if you have FAX I can send it to you).
 I have successfully interfaced the 32081 to both the HD64180 in my
XLM-180 and the Z-280 in an experimental homebrew machine (an AT with a
brain transplant). I've memory-mapped mine into an unused buffer area in 
the middle of the Z3 data areas and written a little routine that allows 
it to be called by a BDOS call. The beauty of this is that it makes code 
portable between FPU equipped and non-FPU equipped machines. Those
without FPUs can intercept the call and substitute a call to an RSX that 
does the FP calculations in software.
 If you're interested I'll put together some notes on my 32081
applications. National now have the 32581 which is 10-15 times faster
(but much more expensive) and needs a 32 bit bus. The 081 runs with an 8 
or 16 bit bus.
 Hoping this is some help.

Subject: Z280

Hello to all the "old cp/m users"!

As far as I can see in the last entries here, there is a big discussion
about Z80/180/280. I'm very glad to see that because I am just designing
a very nice Computer Board with the Z280.
Here is just a technical shortform:
Z280 in Z-bus-mode (16 bit) driven with maximum clock speed (at this time,
10 MHz), ECB-bus-support for 8-bit-I/O with a bus clock of half the cpu 
clock, on-board RAM (1 meg) and EPROM (128 k), real-time-clock with alarm
and 50 byte nvram, 2 rs-232 with handshake, FDC for up to four drives.
The circuit design seems to be ready (and steady) now, so I'll start with
the layout (single-board europe card) in the next days or weeks.
I'll implement CP/M-3 with some features concerning floppy-i/o etc. (auto-
matic disk exchange recognition, automatic format adjust) just as it works
in my 64180 system (self-designed, too) since nearly 3 years.
I found some interested people here (germany) in our cp/m user's group, 
and I'd like to know if there are more.
Please contact me if you are interested or if you have special ideas for
the circuit design or layout.

Just another theme:
I am programming an ARC utility for CP/M in Turbo-Pascal. I got the sources
from Reimer Mellin and optimized them to take 4k less code and to work about
3 times faster. I am now planning to add the compression methods "squeezing"
and "squashing", but I don't have any kind of algorithm or description of
these methods. Please, keep your eyes open and contact me if there are any
papers about these compression methods.
The result of my work will be public domain. Maybe I'll program an assembler
version of ARC (Z280-Code?) as soon as I get the time.

This is especially for YOU, DOUG and JAY:
I heard something about you were engaged in the lovely Z280, too. I would
like to post my design to one of yours, and to get all information you've
yet worked out. So we could each take advantage of the other's ideas.
What do you think about it? Please let me know (or post your knowledge):

Subject: Z80 FPUs

Thanks for the tip Greg. I'll give National a call and see what I can
dig out of them. BTW, I hadn't been planning on using an 8087 by itself; 
it's apparent very quickly that the easiest way to use that beast is to
pair it with an 8088, then talk to the pair thru some I/O ports with the 
Z80.

Subject: ARC for CP/M (Turbo-Pascal-Version)

For all american friends who are interested in ARC/CPM:

I got mail from Dan McGuirk (Crossroads, Phoenix) concerning delivery of
my new "ARC for CP/M" utility.
Well, that is not one of the small programs (at this time, 1400 lines
without squeezing & squashing and without inline-sourcecodes), so transfer
via e-mail will be a little bit too expensive "across the ocean".
I think it is best to send a copy of the program to Jay Sage, who has good
contacts to a friend of mine here in germany, and he could distribute it
over the usa. What do you think about it, Jay?

Hello Dan, don't be angry for getting this "unpersonal" reply, but I think
there may be some others who should know about this distribution method.

  I just got a couple of Osborne 1's, and now...questions, questions,

  First off, they came with an external monitor, but no plugs to go
on the vidoe connectors to activate the built in monitors.  I'm going
to see if the last owner has them and just forgot to send them, but
in case he doesn't, does anybody know how to make them?

  Next, one of them has an internal modem; what sort of commands does
it respond to?  And somebody said something about an 80 column upgrade;
any source for these?  Or for high density drive upgrades?

  And, lastly, is there an ftp site for cp/m software (yeah I know I'm

  thanks for any and all info...e-mail would probably be wise, and I'll

Sorry, the Z280 (Z8000) instruction set is a superset of the Z80
instruction set; it's the same sitiuation as using the HD64180 (Z180)!
As far as I know the NS32K never understands any Z80 instruction :-).

   You asked over the Internet about people who have Amstrad PCW
computers and use them under CP/M-Plus.  I do.  I bought it mainly to
test, develop, and produce the version of Z-System that runs under CP/M-
Plus.  I was surprised at what a fine performer the machine is, largely
because of the nice RAM disk drive.  I would be happy to correspond with
you.  It was a great disappointment to me to see how few Amstrad owners
make use of the CP/M capability.

I have the technical manual for the whole kaypro line as of about two
years ago, so I can send you specs if you like.  I don't remember
anything in the manual other than pinouts and circuitry, however.
Mostly it is a "if this happens, replace the motherboard" document.
BTW, you can get this book from Kaypro but it'll take some
arm-twisting to do it.

Along a similar line, does anyone know where I can find information
about the Kaypro II ('83?  the pre-'84 model) hardware?  I really want
to implement a terminal emulator and possibly my own small OS, but
currently have little knowledge of the Z80 and the Kaypro hardware.
Given that I have the little beastie and it's not doing much now
except running my address program, I figure I ought to use it for
something.  If the thing has some kind of timer interrupt I'd love to
make a multitasking OS for it.

If anyone has any information on C compilers, commercial or otherwise,
which run on the Kaypro, I'd like leads on them too.

Thanks for any help,

   First, to Tilmann Reh.  I would be very happy to receive a disk from
you with the CP/M ARC program.  I can make sure that it gets to
SIMTEL20, to GEnie, and to the RCPM network in the US.

   Next, for Kevin Lund.  For Osborne stuff, the company to turn to is
Worswick Industries in San Diego, CA.  The number I have for them is
619-571-5400.  If you are interested in CP/M you should consider joining
the Boston Computer Society ZI/TEL Group (I am one of its directors) or
(especially for Osbornes) FOG.  FOG now covers all machines and both DOS
and CP/M, but there roots are in the Osborne world.  You will find ads
from Worswick in the FOG publications.  You might look into GEnie, too.
FOG has a roundtable area there, and we have a general CP/M area as
well.

   Finally, to Nick Sayer.  There are lots of RCPM systems around.  Look
for the RCPMxxxx listing files on SIMTEL20.  One especially good one for
someone in your position is Keith Petersen's Royal Oak system.  He
should have EVERYTHING you need.  Unfortunately, its phone number is
stashed in my autodial directory at home.  I'm sure someone else here
(if not even Keith himself) will be posting it in response to your
request.  I might add that your list suggests that you were -- if not in
the dark ages -- at least in the dim ages of CP/M software.  You should
check out crunching, which has replaced squeezing.

Enough already!

Only one person correctly identified the problem I was having: CP/M 2.2
SUBMIT.COM works under 3.0, but XSUB.COM _DOESN'T_ - 3.0 uses a different
mechanism to feed .SUB file lines into the program being executed. Hence
my useage of XSUB was failing, and the rest of the script with it. Remember,
the 3.0 CCP doesn't live at the top like it does under 2.2, so XSUB was
getting all confused with the 2K hole it left to protect CCP, plus the
mechanics of how CCP was re-entered when a program exited didn't work.

     Does anyone know what INT 28h is under DEC Rainbow CP/M 86?  I'm trying
to move a copy of WordStar from that OS to generic CP/M-86 ( if Compupro
CP/M 8-16 can be said to be generic ), and I'm getting undefined interrupt
messages all over the place.

     Removing the call, or placing an IRET at that location, causes the
program to not function at all, thus I deduce it's returning something
important.  Immediately after each INT, CL is alwaytested.  I assume that the
returned value is there.

Subject: The Z-System

   Someone a digest or two back asked what Z-System is.  Here is a copy
of the shortest of the writeups I have on the subject.  Perhaps it will
provide a start.

                           --------------------

   Z-System is a modern replacement for CP/M that can give your little
8-bit computer some of the "look and feel" of more powerful hardware
like PCs, Macintoshes, and even minicomputer workstations.  You can get
your work done more easily and have more fun doing it!  All your CP/M
programs can still be used just the way they are now, but here are some
examples of just a few of the new things you can do.

*  NAMED DIRECTORIES -- example: your letters can be kept in a directory
   called LETTERS, and WordStar can edit one using "WS LETTERS:JOE.LTR".

*  SHELLS -- you can change the way the computer interacts with you by
   selecting a shell.  Example: ZFILER provides a "point and shoot"
   environment.  Files are displayed graphically on the screen.  You
   move a pointer to the file of your choice and press a key to perform
   an operation.  A simple text file that you write with your
   wordprocessor defines the functions for each key!

*  ALIASES -- you can define your own new commands that stand for whole
   sequences of commands.  Example: using aliases you can create
   additional configurations of WordStar (perhaps WS60 and WS76 for
   versions with right margins of 60 and 76), and the extra disk space
   used is only a few bytes!

*  HISTORY -- Z-System can remember all the commands you enter, let you
   recall them, edit them, and run them again.

Subject: Help with antique S100 memory boards

Yesterday I bought a couple of ancient 64k S100 memory cards (for 50
cents each at a garage sale) in hopes I could use them in my Zenith
Z-100 system.  I have no documentation, though, and no idea how to set
the dip switches.

The boards say "MM65K16S rev 3 Copyright 1981 Memory Merchant".  I
know it's a longshot, but does anyone out there happen to have
documentation for these antiques?

Does anyone know of any good music cards for the S-100 bus and any
accompanying CP/M software?  Thanks in advance.

Subject: vt100 emulation/hard drives/ communications

Terminal Software:

Could anyone recommend the best terminal/comunications/transfer package to
use with a Kaypro 4/84 cp/m machine?  I'm looking for:

	1. vt100 emulation
	2. some standard transfer protocols (ie. kermit, Xmodem)
	3. some good ones (ie. Zmodem)
	4. macros would be good.
	5. auto login capabilities, perhaps.
If anyone knows of such a wonder package for the Kaypro or cp/m in general,
could you please mail me info on how/where to get it.  If there is none, how
about some info on how I would go about writing my own; such as some good 
books.  Is vt100 even possible for the Kaypro 4?


Hard Drives:

I am also looking to put a hard drive inside that sherman tank of a case.  How 
do I go about doing this?  Are there any good books I could read? Where do I 
start?  (I have a 20meg from an ibm compatible...any good?)


Compilers:

I would like to hear about the compilers available and how they fair.  I want
a C compiler for my machine...what should I get?  And most importantly,
how and where?  And how much$$!  $-)  It looks like I'm going to have to be 
using modula-2 for some courses, so I'm also interested in hearing about them
as well.  

Thanks in advance for any and all replies.  Please reply by mail to:
mjarvis@polyslo.CalPoly.EDU  and I will summerize.

I have a couple of term programs which will do all the above quite
well.  ZMP has the Zmodem protocol and is VERY easy to configure,
plus easy to configure and use macros.  Plus I have another program
called "Qterm" which has a very good script language, an VT100
emulation.  I have had a great deal of luck with Qterm in
transferring stuff from our local UNIX system because it deals with
the CR/LF dilemma so easily.  Plus it has a few other neat things,
plus the whole shmear is memory resident.  I will configure both
programs for use with Kaypro.  May take a while, but I promise, I
will do it.  In the meantime, have fun!  (or at least try...)

Sorry again, but the Z280 is neither a Z8000 nor a superset of the Z80
(as far as I know, I have a reference man at home and now I'm at work).
The Z80, Z280 and Z8000 are three completely different CPUs.

So, if You're going to use an incompatible CPU, take a good one (NS32K)!
