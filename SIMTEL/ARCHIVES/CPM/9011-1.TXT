Subject: CP/M- and MSDOS-compatible file-crunching?
Message-ID: <4488.9010311817@np1a.bristol.ac.uk>

Does anyone know of a Crunching/Squeezing/Zipping-type method of
compressing ascii files, that would work under CP/M as well as either
MSDOS or UNIX?  If so, is the relevant software available in the
public domain?  The reason for my inquiry is that I have an occasional
need for transferring textfiles created on my Amstrad CP/M machine at
home, on 3-inch (*not* 3.5-inch!)  diskettes, to an IBM-PC machine at
work.  I achieve this via modem+kermit to the University mainframe, at
300 baud, which which takes forever and costs lots.  (I subsequently
download from the mainframe to a PC, at 9600 baud, which is fast and
free, so that step is trivial).  Any way of reducing the file size for
the modem transfer would obviously be very beneficial!  My only other
options are to buy expensive auxillary hardware and transport disks to
and from work, or to take up weight-training and carry one of the
computers instead...

Any help would be much appreciated.

Apparently xait don't like % signs in addresses that arrive over the Internet.
Try ....!xait.xerox.com!pallio!rna

Unfortunately, this is quickly going to become somewhat academic, since in
about two weeks, pallio will be going off line. This is only a temporary
hiatus, since I'm moving from Boston to San Francisco. I'll get pallio
back on line as soon as I get set up, but it may be a while before the
server is on line, since I'll have to be sure I won't swamp my feed. I'll
post here once I'm connected again, and when the rna server is running.

Re: Bondwell Terminal Emulation

Nick--

You might try checking on SIMTEL20 for some MEX overlays.  I recall that
seeing at least an overlay for IMP and MEX for the Bondwell-12s (and 
maybe even MDM7, but don't quote me...).  If you can't track one down,
I can hunt in my archives for a copy.  Also, there (was/is?) a Bondwell
BBS in Southern California; you might try checking the RCPM listing.

    another beef...  z80mu 3.10 does not support parameters in a
submit command.   i.e. simple submit files work, but when you have
any parameters after the sub filename, it gives you an invocation
summary, and does not run the command.

    this is a big problem for me since i use submit files to automate
program assembly and compilation.  this requires specifying the
source filename after the subfile name.

I personally don't use Z80MU or even 22NICE all that much.  My
hard disk space is currently devoted to other tasks.  When I do
need to run a Z80-based application on an oddball setup, I go to
my CompuPro System 8/16 running Concurrent DOS 8/16.  I can run a
few well-behaved MS-DOS programs on it, like PKARC (PKZIP isn't
that well-behaved with CDOS).  Plus with SPUZ board, that thing
can run Z80-based applications like a bat out of hell with a Z80H
processor on it!  Also I have gobs of TPA space because "BDOS"
and "BIOS" (actually, the bulk thereof) are located outside of
the SPUZ's memory area (what IS in there is some code to prepare
to jump to the 86 XIOS code), so I can do some memory-intensive
stuff.

As for software emulation of a Z80, I have heard that the 68K
would be a better candidate for the job than, say, the 8088, or
even the 80286.

When pallio returns depends on when he finds a feed.  I mean, after all,

   Somebody here asked me if we had a ZMP overlay for the Osborne 1
some time ago, and I had a look into it. I gave up, mainly because there
seemed to be a bewildering array of different RS232 interfaces for the
things, and also because I didn't actually have one of the beasties
to work on (which makes it much harder!). I would appreciate a copy of
your ZMP overlay if possible.

ZMP and RZMP. Anyone got anything they'd like to see included?

Thanks for asking

1) Please check out the new "standard" for tracking & logging phone call
   connect times and charges.  I read about it in a recent SHAREWARE Mag.
   My reason for this is:  I just got my 3 month Telecom Bill for A$600!!
   It would be nice to control costs if I knew how much I was on-line as
   I went along thru my BBSing. . .   The "standard" uses a file format &
   data sequence to accomplish this goal.  Time is taken from the micro and
   all the user has to enter is the rates & the off peak times.  It's hard
   for me to remember since in the US (I'm a Yank) the bills are monthly. . .

2) The BAUD mem location (3C?) always contains a value for 450 baud, which is 
   of course useless to me & my modem.  Since this "Valid" value is in there,
   ZMP does not initialize the modem, so I must do it manually.  (annoying)
   Maybe do an ESC L I and just leave the Baud alone?

3) An alternate dialler directory, with a script for each # after connect?
   I've run out of room in the one ESC I directory. . . The delay between
   pressing ESC I and seeing the directory is a little too long for my tastes.
   Maybe you could put that in the config file too?  The delay that is . . .

4) VT terminal emulation, with Kermit Xfer protocol capabilities. .. 
   I tend to use Kermit-80 for the links to the VAX at work, but would like
   to use ZMP all the time!!  (Much nicer :-) )

BTW, Is there a ZMP overlay for a computer using a Z80-SIO that has implemented
the interrupt driven capabilities?  I have 3 Kaypros, and put the 884 MAXROM
from Microcornucopia in 'em, so I've rewritten alot of the KP overlays, screen
dump & other neat stuff.  But I want to steal the code for the SIO interrupt
routines from another overlay, if possible. . .   Any ideas?  I'll have to 
get them from this other program other wise.  It uses queues and pointers &
alot of work basically.  If I can avoid this, I will!  Thanks for your ear. . 

I know that's alot to ask for, but ZMP can be head & shoulders above the rest!

The following article appeared in the PIPMAG online magazine on GEnie.
I found it interesting because of the history it contains, but also
because it explains why I spend my time beating my head against a 14"
green phosphor tube, covered with the Z80 assembler neumonics that
make up QTERM, when I could do it in C on the 386 UNIX crate at work,
and get it written much quicker.

                       Zen and the Art of CP/M

                     Robert Coleman (R.COLEMAN3)


It was late.  Maybe midnight, and quiet in the house.  Upstairs, my 
wife and son were probably asleep.  I could hear the faint sound of 
the TV droning; that and the soft breeze outside my opened window.  
Whoosh!  Drive A on my computer was busy at work.  I was backing up 
some files and doing general housekeeping after a long session at the 
keyboard.  Tic-tic, whoosh, tic-tic!  Drive B kicked in.  I watched.  
I had to smile.  It was noisier than drive A -- always was (I could 
close my eyes and tell which of my drives were running, just by the 
sounds they made).  Drive B was perhaps the better of the two.  It was 
newer.  But they were both slow; just as slow and tired as I was now.  
I looked up at the window and felt the cool breeze on my skin.  No, 
they weren't the fastest drives.  Not like the 1.2 Meg on my 386 at 
work.  That was much faster; faster by a country mile.  And I pushed 
it too -- pushed the hell out of it.  But that was work.  Now, just 
being here late at night with this old CP/M computer, it was somehow 
different...

Zen and the Art of CP/M?  (...like Motorcycle Maintenance?  [1]) 
Crazy?  Hey, I'm not the first to get this feeling of religious fervor 
over a computer operating system.  How about 'The SOUL of CP/M' and 
'The CP/M BIBLE' [2,3].  Mr. Waite and associates, they too had 
reverence for this IDEA.  In spite of MS-DOS, countless thousands 
still cling to CP/M.  Why?  Good question.  Perhaps it has more to do 
with the intangibles -- faith, acceptance, quiet devotion, and a brand 
of grass-roots, seat-of-the-pants wisdom.  The CP/Mer assumes a 
tongue-in-cheek posture; all the while, watching the rest of the 
computer world spin its wheels in a deluge of glitter, gloss and 
Madison Avenue hype.  It appears that regardless of the odds, in an 
era of disposable widgets and planned obsolescence, in the face of 
such staunch and resolute adversity, CP/M is here to stay.  In the 
words of one PIPMAG author, Jim Taylor, CP/M is 'the peoples operating 
system'.

It is interesting that in spite of CP/M's continued popularity, the 
name 'CP/M' has been interpreted to mean several things:  The CP/M 
Bible refers to it as 'control program for microprocessor'.  In one 
Digital Research, Inc. CP/M Users Manual dated 1979, it is referred to 
as 'control program for microcomputer'.  Still, I have heard it 
referred to as 'control program monitor'.  These discrepancies of 
course only add to the mystique.  I guess any CP/Mer worth his salt 
has read the basics, but just where DID CP/M come from?  Where does it 
fit into the computer world as we enter the 1990s?

Perhaps the largest MAINFRAME computer, and the grand-daddy of them 
all, was the UNIVAC computer of 1950.  Built entirely of vacuum tubes, 
it was so big it filled a large room.  And the PDP-8 MINICOMPUTER, 
costing a mere $50,000, brought computing to corporate business in the 
mid-60s.  But it was the advent of the microprocessor that made the 
MICROCOMPUTER a reality.  

In 1969, engineers at Datapoint Corporation of San Antonio, Texas, 
designed a simple central processing unit and contracted both Intel 
and Texas Instruments to implement the design on a single piece of 
silicon.  Intel succeeded, but the product ran ten times slower than 
had been agreed upon, so Datapoint backed out of the deal.  Intel 
decided to go ahead and market the device and called it the 8008 
microcomputer [4].  Little did they know that this humble device 
signaled the beginning of the microcomputer revolution.  

The 8008 was truly limited, and was used as a controller such as in 
robot stepper motors and push button TVs.  The 8080, more-or-less its 
direct descendent, was the first microprocessor with an instruction 
set powerful enough to do real data processing.  But these were still 
humble beginnings.  In 1974, a microcomputer kit was sold to hobbyists 
called the Altair 8800.  It featured switches to enter data, and LEDs 
as a monitor device.  There was no keyboard, no CRT, and no floppy 
drives, which meant no stored programs.  All programs had to be 
tediously entered by hand, byte by byte.  This was indeed the stone 
age of microcomputing.  They say that necessity is the mother of 
invention -- thus the birth of an operating system.  CP/M was 
originally developed by Gary Kildall in 1973 for testing 8" Shugart 
disk drives.  Later, in 1976, he founded Digital Research, Inc. and 
released CP/M, targeted at 8080 microcomputer hobbyists [5].  But the 
8080 was slow, and needed three different voltage levels and several 
support ICs to operate.  It was soon replaced by the 8085 which 
required only +5 volts to run.  Then, later came the Z80.  It was not 
only 8080/8085 software compatible, but included many additional, more 
powerful instructions.  By 1980, with the Z80, CP/M had truly become 
the industry standard.  

This is where Big Blue enters the picture.  Microcomputers by this 
time were starting to find use in the business world.  IBM realized 
the vast commercial potential and was gearing up for a major 
onslaught.  They had been associated with quality mainframe computers, 
and most experts agreed that they would become the leader in the 
microcomputer field -- in essence, they would decide the future of 
microcomputing.  IBM chose the 8088 microprocessor by Intel, and with 
Microsoft, they developed a new operating system called PC-DOS 
(essentially the same as MS-DOS -- Microsoft's stand alone version).  
Today, PC doesn't just mean personal computer -- it means IBM 
compatible.  

For the uninitiated, let's take a look inside these machines and 
see what all the fuss is about.  The 8088/8086 microprocessor, which 
is used in the PC-XT and its clones, is vaguely similar to our 8080 
(the NEC V20 version can run 8080 instructions).  It has an 8-bit data 
bus but 16-bit internal architecture and is considered a 16-bit 
microprocessor.  The 8086 is an upgrade with a full 16-bit data bus.  
The major feature of the 8088/8086 is the ability to address up to 1M 
of RAM using 'segment address-extension' registers.  This method is 
similar to CP/M 3.0's method of using multiple banks, only in the 
8088/8086, this technique is used to the fullest.  Much like the 8080, 
the 8086 can only use 64K at a time, but it has 10 banks of 64K each.  
This makes a total of 640K of RAM.  By using other tricks it can 
access many megabytes of additional memory.

Another member of the 8086 family is the 80286.  It provides 12 Mhz 
operation, a crude form of multi-tasking (running several SMALL 
programs at once) and is used in the PC-AT and its clones.  The 80386 
is another upgrade which provides up to 33 Mhz operation, a full 32-
bit bus and addressing up to 4 Gigabytes of memory.  And the 80486 is 
yet the latest upgrade, which provides further streamlining with a 
built-in cache memory controller and a coprocessor to speed up 
floating point calculations.  These microprocessors are currently 
considered the 'leading edge technology' and are the darlings of the 
micro world [6].  But even now, there is talk of MS-DOS being replaced 
in the 1990s with UNIX, a true multi-user/multi-tasking operating 
system.

There is another class of super microprocessors, such as the 
Motorola 88000.  These new devices use RISC technology (RISC -- 
'Reduced Instruction Set Computer').  They provide even faster 
execution by implementing a more efficient set of instructions and 
executing these within one machine cycle.  Whew!

Okay, so what does this mean for CP/M?  The microcomputer, which 
started out as an experiment and a boon for hobbyists has now become 
the workhorse of the corporate business establishment.  The 80286-386-
486 explosion is being fueled by big business, where money is no 
object and there is a constant demand for ever more speed and 
efficiency.  Through CAD (Computer Aided Design), these powerful 
microcomputers are now being used by scientists and engineers.  By 
connecting them together with LANs (Local Area Networks), some experts 
predict microcomputers will be direct competition for the minicomputer 
market which has already taken a beating in recent times.  But while 
these advances are impressive, it leaves one piece of the puzzle 
missing.  What about the consumer?  It is true, most people can afford 
a simple XT.  What does that mean really?  Today, most GOOD software 
written for MS-DOS is expensive.  And to enjoy the fruits of the 
leading edge, you have to constantly upgrade your equipment.  The 
latest software offerings for PCs aren't designed to run on two 
floppies -- a hard drive is MANDATORY.  A VGA monitor alone can cost 
more than an entire monochrome XT package.  Getting caught up in this 
spiraling staircase of madness is frightening and can lead to gross 
over-spending and perhaps even what I like to call 'PC-phobia' -- the 
fear of owning an inferior computer.  In reality, the PC revolution 
could be thought of as a plush banquet, where Big Business is picking 
up the tab, and the gamers are picking up the crumbs, hanging on to 
Sugar Daddy's coat tails.  

The dream among countless, now defunct computer manufacturers in 
the early 80s of fully automated lifestyles with a computer in every 
home was just that, a dream, and one that I fear will not soon be 
realized.  Let's face it, using a computer requires some effort, some 
learning on the part of the user.  You can't just turn it on like a 
VCR or a Nintendo.  Even the 'point and click' fad is too strenuous 
for most of the general public.  I venture to say that there is NO 
well defined home computer market.  All the non-IBM/clone platforms 
are beginning to fall away; ie:  Commodore C-series, Atari, even some 
Apple II-series.  The only true home computer market is really the 
COMPUTER HOBBYIST, and CP/M is still the ideal operating system for 
such a phenomenon.

It is conceivable that a CP/M supercomputer could be designed to 
have many of the bells and whistles of MS-DOS.  The HD64180 is an 
integrated Z80 microcontroller with several built-in features: 10 Mhz 
operation, two DMA controllers, two serial ports, and a programmable 
timer.  But the most notable feature is the ability to address up to 1 
Meg of memory using a built-in MMU (Memory Management Unit -- similar 
to the 'segment address-extension registers' in the 8086 family, 
previously mentioned).  A SCSI bus (Small Computer System Interface) 
could be used to interface up to eight devices; ie:  hard drives, 
floppy drives, tape drives, printers, etc.  This system could have 
high-resolution bit-mapped graphics, and perhaps even some form of 
multi-tasking (MP/M-II).  The only problem is that CP/M as we know it 
has no provisions for handling graphics, let alone 1 Meg of memory!  
Alas, I have found myself fantasizing at times about such a machine.  
I have personally designed several 68000 microprocessor-driven 
systems, and it would not be exceptionally difficult to implement the 
64180.  Of course, outside of a few crazies like myself, such a 
machine would have no commercial value in light of the current 
technologies.  It would merely be one CP/Mers dream of power and 
glory.  (NOTE: anyone out there who has similar ideas of building a 
CP/M supercomputer or who knows of such a beast, please drop me a line 
via GEnie mail. [Note - I posted asking about that large multi-user
CP/M system in the Netherlands a few days ago, I'd like to pass that
information on to Rob Coleman -- dg]

Anyway, what makes CP/M so special?  Well, to begin with, it was 
the first successful disk operating system.  Living life as a 
microcomputerist before CP/M was akin to living without indoor 
plumbing.  And to think that a boni fide computer system like the 
UNIVAC, that once filled an entire room, could now sit on a table top, 
I find astonishing.  And further, the BDOS/BIOS concept is ingenious.  
The compatablitily of CP/M operated systems allows the user to share 
the experience with dissimilar hardware platforms -- thus a whole 
computing community is enriched.  And even more, anyone who lives in 
the MS-DOS world can feel comfortable with CP/M.  After all, MS-DOS 
really grew out of CP/M; many of the commands and file handling 
schemes are similar.  But more than anything else, maybe SIMPLICITY is 
what makes CP/M so appealing.  As in Art, there is a beauty in 
simplicity and symmetry, combined with functionality.  And CP/M is 
just that, a simple, straight-forward solution to operating a personal 
microcomputer system.

I guess personal computing is different for others.  There's Dan-
the-man, my snippidy next door neighbor, the one with the super AT 
with VGA.  I have been to his house to marvel over his computer 
before, and it IS a remarkable machine.  It would be ridiculous to 
ignore the fact that this is no doubt a far superior machine to 
anything in the CP/M world.  The speed is overwhelming, the graphics 
dazzling.  It is awe inspiring, the shear, unbridled power!  (Excuse 
me, I get excited about computers -- any flavor.) Dan-the-man is 
indeed one happy camper, as well he should be.  But I am baffled.  
What I find unsettling is the way he PERCEIVES personal computing.

Case in point: No sooner did he get this amazing machine, then he 
was planning to buy another, more powerful one.  Why?  I'm not sure.  
Is it the 'first on the block' syndrome, or is it that he really needs 
that kind of computing power?  Dan-the-man plays many computer games 
and experiments with various software packages.  Now six months later, 
he's ready for a new machine.  He hasn't even learned how to use THIS 
one yet.  Speaking of falling in love with one's computer; Dan-the-man 
not only has no loyalty, he is a technological flirt!  In this 
relationship, there seems to be something missing.  Hmmm...

Anyone who would care to notice, would be astounded at the 
longevity of the Commodore 64 computer.  True, this little machine is 
edging its way to obsolescence, but what a journey it has seen!  
Nearly eight years after its debut, there is still a large group of 
devotees.  There are, as a rough guesstimate, about seven or eight 
million of these machines around the world.  Not all gamers either I 
remind you; there are multitudes of application programs that have 
been written for it.  With its handful of ROM-based kernel calls and 
its graphics capabilities, the C64 is a veritable programmer/hacker's 
delight.  How many imaginations have been stirred by these 8-bit 
wonders?  How many computer software careers do you suppose have been 
launched by these little 'toy' computers?  I have read articles in 
some trade magazines by professional programmers who STILL enjoy 
hacking on them.  These people really love the little computer.  In 
this relationship, there seems a great deal of dedication.  Obviously, 
personal computing means different things to different people.

Meanwhile, back in my den, whoosh-tic!  Both drives came to a halt.  
I read the directory of the backed-up floppy.  Everything looked good.  
I wondered, should I check for bad sectors?  But then again, the 
format command should have detected any of these.  I yawned.  Now I 
yearned for sleep.  Inadvertently, I ran scan.com to look for a bad 
sector, only I entered the A drive by mistake.  I cringed as I 
realized that my boot disk was now being scanned for bad sectors.  
This is NOT what I had intended.  So much for working when I was 
tired.  But behold!  There was a bad sector detected on my boot 
floppy!  I glared at the message on the monitor with disbelief.  I 
thought to myself, maybe the A drive was overheating.  That had to be 
it.  I ran scan.com again with the boot disk in the B drive.  Again -- 
a bad sector -- the same one.  I decided to fix the problem NOW.  No 
matter how tired I was, I couldn't go to sleep having my boot disk 
corrupted.  No way.  That would be sacrilege.  
    
I pulled out my back-up boot disk (yes, I had a back-up, but that 
is a different story!).  I pip'd the contents to my RAM drive and then 
reformatted the corrupted boot disk.  Outside my window, I heard a 
bird call, close in, near the house.  I looked briefly to the open 
window, then back to the task at hand.  Once again, I ran scan.com.  
Good!  No bad sectors.  Patiently, I waited as the RAM disk contents 
were copied back onto the boot floppy.  

'Booting' -- what an odd term.  In the early 1970s, practically all 
memories were magnetic core types.  These memories had tiny toroid-
shaped magnets spaced between a lattice-work of wires.  The direction 
of the current through one wire determined the logic value, and 
current through the other determined whether that value was read or 
written into the magnet-element.  These devices were non-volatile, and 
held their contents even when the power was removed.  But when this 
data was corrupted, a small program had to be entered to load the 
system code.  This was a tedious process in those days -- done either 
with switches or paper tape input.  The solution?  A small loader 
program was entered manually which loaded another program which 
actually loaded the system code.  This small loader program was called 
a 'bootstrap' loader.  The system was loaded, or pulled up by its own 
bootstraps.  Hence the term -- 'boot' [7].  

Whoosh-tic!  The A drive came to a stop.  I then rebooted.  It was 
done.  All was fine in the world.  Again, there was the bird outside 
my window.  I got up and walked over to have a look.  Again, I heard 
the cooing.  It came from the bushes near the tree out front.  It was 
really too dark to see.  Up in the sky, I could see the crescent moon 
hanging lazily in the heavens, amidst a slight veil of wispy cloud.  I 
listened and heard silence.  In the dim light, I glanced back at my 
computer; my reconditioned boot disk.  Yes...  all WAS fine in the 
world.  I was ready for sleep.

It has been said that perhaps the true delight is not in arriving 
at the destination, but in the journey itself; to occasionally stop 
and enjoy the view.  If even just to simply smell the fragrance of 
flowers, or ponder over a private thought.  I, myself, find the 
personal computing experience to be just that -- PERSONAL.  It is a 
quiet time alone, away from the stress and strain of everyday life.  
And it is during these times that I learn about strength and weakness, 
success and failure; the value of work; and play for the sake of play; 
and ways of acceptance.  Perhaps it is in this process of DOING that I 
find the real reward.  Knowing the joy of getting a five page, hand 
typed program to finally run.  Learning to accept that slow, noisy 
drive.  Learning that there is always another corner to turn, another 
page to read.  Learning that maybe there is wisdom in discovering even 
just one little, simple thing each day.  If only for this, it has been 
worth the while.  Oh yes, it could be model cars, or stamp collecting, 
or flower arranging.  But it is when these things cease to be mere 
objects and become vehicles, taking us someplace else, to some secret, 
private place, they bring us closer to the inner self.  By pouring 
over the tired guts of my old CP/M computer, cursing myself for having 
misplaced my screw driver AGAIN, perhaps I learn a little more about 
myself.

Hi:
	I have an ECBplus Master, which is a processor card for the 
ECB-bus and with a Z80H processor.  It runs under CP/M 2.2+ and it's 
made by a German company called miro Datensysteme.
	Is there anyone who has got Kermit running on this computer?
I could also use a program that can read MS-DOS disks or a MS-DOS 
program that can read disks formatted with the ECBplus Master.
	Please, send me an e-mail if you know where to find these
programs!

Thanks,

   i heard a little about that version of the z80 some years back, 
but never could get any information about whether it's available in
single piece quantities.  i have a trs 2 that i jacked up to 6 mhz,
if i could get the H chip i'd be able to go all the way to 10 mhz.
what i really want is a 12 to 16 mhz z80 code compatible processor.
does anyone know if such a beast exists??

Could someone enlighten me on this market?  I'm currently running a BBS with an

The sudden interest here in CP/M emulators has got me back to work on
mine.  Perhaps everyone who has one in the works should get together
and get something finished.  Anyway, since everyone is describing
the features of their stuff here is mine.

--------------------- Canned speech starts here ------------------------- 
This is a quick overview of my CP/M emulator for Unix.  I wrote a decoder
for the 8080 instruction set.  Eventually I will upgrade it to a full Z80
decoder.  Whenever the PC is >= 0xfec0 it executes a return no matter what
is in RAM at that location.  Before calling the routine for each instruction
I look at the PC and end the program if it is zero or perform a BDOS function
if it is 0xfec0 or BIOS if it is >= 0xff00.  Since the emulator ignores the
contents of memory as far as instruction decoding is concerned, The system
has the interesting property of being able to use all of memory except the
first 0x100 bytes for user programs by putting the stack at 0xfffe.  In fact
the default stack when a program is run is set to 0xfff0.

I use Unix commands to simulate some CP/M commands such as DIR, REN, TYPE
and handle things such as SAVE internally.  I use the Unix file system for
drives.  The user defines Unix directories to CP/M drive mappings.  This
allows CP/M to use the same file system as the Unix but does force CP/M
conventions on the file names such as upper case, must have 1 and only 1
period, etc.  It is easy to handle though since one can always link files
as necessary, even from CP/M since I also include a '!' command to do Unix
commands from within CP/M.

Programs that use IN and OUT opcodes will fail.  All I/O must go through
the BDOS or the BIOS.  The user can set up the following devices:  Screen
(CON out), keyboard (CON in), RDR, PUN and LST.  The default for screen
and keyboard is stdout and stdin.  The user can set up Unix files for any
of these devices.  The file of course can be an actual file, a device or even
a pipe to a command, even another CP/M command that has the keyboard reading
from the same pipe.

It's not quite finished yet but I am running simple programs with it now.
All the 8080 opcodes are being emulated and some of the Z80.
--------------------- End of canned speech --------------------------------

It is running programs now but it is just so slow that I am trying to
improve the decoder.  If I ever get it finished I will be sure to post
it.

     One thing *I'd* like to see is the ability to include a
long-distance code in the phone library.  Right now, you HAVE to wait
until the library displays on the screen, then hit either '+' or '-',
then your # selection.  And if you forget, well....

     Then again, I'd also like to see that delay after ESC-I go
away....

Here is my feedback.  I have used it to transfer stuff to/from a PC
running ZCOMM via a serial cable.  It runs real fast.

1: You need to be able to have it find the overlays on a drive/user area
different than where you keep the .com or your current directory.
The drive and user area could be specified in the overlay?

2: When sending ASCII files from the PC to CP/M, they ended up padded
with up to 127 bytes of junk.  I can't say if this is a bug in ZCOMM
or ZMP.  Perhaps ZMP forgets to add the ctrl-Z?  Sorry, I can't
remember more.  I also don't know the versions of the software.
Mail me if you need more info.

I don't know about Unix, but you could use the ARK utility for CP/M, which
is compatible with MS-DOS's ARC.

Hope this helps...     Darrell

I have a ZILOG Literature Guide from an Electronic Engineering Times
Special Issue "Microprocessor Design Guide".  I recieved it in the
mail last week.  One of the available pieces of literature from Zilog
is "Z84C00 20MHz Z80 CPU", part number DC-2523-01.  I was a bit surprized
to see it...  I was planning to write to them to get a copy, it says
here that it is free.  The address given is:

		Zilog
		210 Hacienda Ave. M/S C1-0
		Cambell, CA  95008-6609
		They also give a phone number (408)370-8016.

Now let's see... 20Mhz cpu, a couple of 128k x 8 fast static rams...

Anyone looking for extra rigid space on the 820-II or 16/8 might try 
calling Holly Park RCP/M in NJ, or Socrates RCP/M (also in NJ?).  Both
sysops have put together packages for expanding rigid space and also 
ataching extra drives.  There is also a package availabe for chaining
multiple 8" sa1004's up to the 820-II (written by Russ Pencin many

     Users of IMP, MODEM7, etc. will be saddened by the following  news about
Irv Hoff dying of cancer. Just today (Sunday, Oct. 28, 1990) I captured the
following  message from Fog's BB #1 in Daly City, CA, and am posting it here
for your information. I'm sure that users of both MODEM7 and IMP (and I'm one
of thousands) would want to know about his fatal illness. No later word
about Irv appeared on Fog's BB, so I don't know whether he is still alive.

  From: JIM SWITZ
    To: ALL USERS
 About: Irv Hoff 

To Whom It May Concern:

   I just saw an old friend of mine tonight - Irv Hoff.  For those of you
who've known Irv, you know that he's meant a lot to our BBS hobbies and
addictions.  From the earliest days of CP/M teleommunications, Irv was there,
with MDM740, IMP, BYE5, KMD and so many other applications and utilities vital
to us in those days.  Some were original, others were built from the work of
others.  And, like many of the pioneers of shared software (NOT shareware
software), Irv released his source code freely, with comments and assistance.
Although he took fierce pride in his work, and was occasionally the focus of
some controversy, he was always wiling to help others and to learn from others
how to improve his own work.  Moreover, Irv actually *encouraged* voice
contact at almost any hour - an extreme rarity among hackers. Much of what Irv
has done has survived to today - buried in countless DOS applications and
utilities as algorithms.

   Anyway, it appears that Irv is not long for this world, quite frankly, and
is suffering from advanced colon cancer.  I was shocked, actually, to see him
show up to tonight's PRACSA meeting.  Judging from his recent messages on the
PRACSA board, I didn't expect to see him again, ever.  He's looking mighty
weak and thin these days, but seemed in relatively good shape, considering,
and brought his wife to meet us.  Recent messages from Irv indicated he
thought he might not see October, much less Christmas, but maybe he's got a
few weeks' reprieve.

   So, for those who know or know of Irv, I thought you should be aware of the
current situation.  I'm sure that some contact from his friends would be most
appreciated now, while he can still deal with the outside world.  He finds it
very hard to even get to his BBS out in the radio room these days, but DOES
check in when he can.

   Let's use the communication pathways that Irv pioneered to get in touch, at
least once, and let him know we're here, and that he's remembered and
appreciated, ok?  His BBS number (PRACSA) is 415-948-2513 in Los Atos Hills,
CA, and can be reached via CAPAL if you use PC Pursuit.
        Regards,
                Jim

-------------------------------------------------------

The CP/M community will surely miss Irv, who has produced a vast collection
of excellent Public Domain software. I hope and pray that the work he has
done will be with us for many years, and that his memory never fades away.

Message-ID: <9011021956.AA19611@E40-008-11.MIT.EDU>

So how many people are interested in collaborating on CP/M or Z80 emulator
development? I had a Z80 emulator on my todo list for years, and then Nick
Sayer came along and announced his, so I went and helped him test and debug
it, rather than duplicate effort; however, there are a number of different
strategies one might use, and there's room for many other designs (in its
current form, with all of my additions, Nick's is quite useful for debugging,
but it is dismayingly slow. A faster implementation might use a different
strategy but not be as good at debugging.)
	If you're interested in actively coding or designing and discussing
strategies for particular instructions or for the overall implementation,
send me email (eichin@athena.mit.edu) and if there is enough interest, I'll
set up the list.

The Wireless Institure of Australia (the Australian Amateur Radio organisation)
maintained its membership records on a Z80 Cromemco system until recently
(at least, I hope they have the replacement system - an AT-clone running
MS-DOG - on-line by now).  The major reason for replacement was problems

   there is a version of arc for both machines, that will build and
dismember archives.   the cp/m version is kinda slow, but at least
it does work.
 
   if you don't need to batch files together, there is a verison of
crunch/uncrunch for msdos, but it's kinda hard to find.
 
   hope that helps...

I'm very happy with ARK11.  I can get it to you, if it's not in SIMTEL.
The size saved is usually at least half of the space previously used.

ARC is not as efficient as ARK.  I found that it's faster. (Assembly coded)
Both are basically compatible I think.  

I believe I have a version of ZIP for CP/M too, but haven't tried it yet.  
Actually just found it after searching for a while thru my collection.
ZIP099 ??   Is there something newer or has someone used this?

Message-ID: <1988@eyrie.img.uu.oz.au>

I'm currently trying to track down a cross compiler for the
HD64180. As most of you would know, this is Hitachi's version
of the Z180. The thing we've got at the moment
(IAR Systems ICCZ80 V2.22C/MD2) is a DOG to put it politely,
managing to fall in an undignified heap whenever we want to
compile more than 30K of C source.

We're using the CPU as a device controller, if it is any
help.

Oh, we're currently cross-compiling from a PC, but it would
be possible to work from a microVAX. UNIX would be difficult
to arrange, but we'd probably be happy to do it just for a
new compiler :)

Thanx in anticipation...

That is an UNZIP-only program.  There are no ZIP programs that I

Subject: Early microcomputer networks
Message-ID: <JIM.90Nov6131135@baroque.Stanford.EDU>

Back in the late 70's and early 80's, the Physics department at
Washington University (St. Louis) had a primitive (by today's
standards) network of 8 to 10 diskless PDP-11's running a modified
RT-11 hanging off of a dedicated PDP-11 disk server.  Each client had
it's own coax link to the server.  (Good thing they had separate lines
too, since nearly every thunderstorm blew the transceiver chips at
both ends of the long line out to the cyclotron building.)

Around 1980, with the proliferation of micros like the Apple II and
S-100 CPM boxes, the architect of the system, Prof. Scandrett,
extended the network so that micros could all share the same cable.

He had it working on the Apple II's.  In 1981, I hacked up CPM's BIOS
to make the disk server look like a (rather large) CPM drive.

Disk storage (other than floppies) was quite expensive at the time, so
I'm sure there were similar ad-hoc networks elsewhere.  Everyone knows
about ethernet, which was by then, I believe, common at most large
universities.  But what about networks that became extinct, the
network dinosaurs?  What was happening with other mini/microcomputer
networks around that time?

As a Kaycomp owner, I disagree.  Single sided, double density on the
original Kaycomp/Kaypro II's.  But at least one of the Osbornes had
single sided, single density on the whole floppy.

Non-Linear Systems demonstrated the Kaycomp II at a computer faire in San
Francisco in 1981.  It had single-sided single-density floppies -- for about
90K of data.  This was similar to the Osborne.  But when the computer started
to be sold a few months later, the computer box had a different look, and the
floppies were single-sided double-density -- for about 180K of data.

I have a sales brochure from Non-Linear Systems for the Kaycomp -- it
talks about the "big" 90 kilobyte disk drives.  The machine pictured
has two full-height drives, mounted vertically on either side of the
crt.  Also, the power switch and crt brightness control are on the
front of the machine -- where they belong!

This may have been asked many times previously, but I missed it-

I have a "stock" Kaypro II-84 with 191K SSDD drives.  What do I need to convert
to DSDD drives besides the drives themselves? (The originals are indeed single-

any?  With the demise of MICROCORNUCOPIA magazine and the advent of MS/DOS, all

Can anyone offer any help?              Thanks

There appears to be a little confusion as to the date of my movement, so
I'll reiterate what will be happening to pallio and the rna server here.

pallio will be online up to the 9th of November, and will probably get
reconnected around the 20th. - 21st. - 22nd. I'll post when I'm online
again, but it will doubtless take a while till the maps get sorted out.

So the 10th. through about the 22nd. I'm going to be offline, and for a
while after that, it'll be harder to get in at me.

I had no idea Irv was ill. He was a _tremendous_ help to me years ago, when I
was just starting my microcomputer days (via Morrow MD-2). His series of 
MDMxxx overlays made it possible for me to get online and expand my knowledge
of telecommunications. Several times we "chatted" on CompuServe; more recently
I had the privilege of giving _him_ advice in my capacity as a Sysop of CIS's
Consumer Electronics Forum. He's always been an exceedingly gracious, tireless
gentleman. I hope with all my heart he can beat his illness.

As I recall, the program MFDISK for the Kaypro II listed a SSSD option under
the Kaypro selection.  So *some* model of Kaypro must have had SD tracks.

Advent Products should still have upgrade products for Kaypros.  They sell
the TurboROM for $60, which knows about DSDD (and 96 tpi) drives.  They 
also sell a drive decoder board that adds the additional logic for 
double-sided drives (also allows up to four drives) -- it goes for $40.  
I believe the TurboROM manual has instructions on how to add the side 
select circuit yourself, too.  Advent's number is 714-630-8172.

By the way, Bridger Mitchell's company, Plu*Perfect Systems apparently
wrote both the TurboROM code and the Turbo BIOS code.

I have no relationship with Advent or Plu*Perfect -- I just think that
they have darned good products that work together.  My Kaypro 2X has
Advent's TurboROM, host-adapter, 1 Meg RAM disk, real-time clock, 
Western Digital WD-1002-005 hard disk controller and a Seagate ST-138-1 
(30 meg) hard drive.  I am using NZCOM and ZSDOS, and it all works.
I also have a MicroSphere Color Graphics board in it, but that's another
story...

But, alas, the phone company recordings tell me that the number has been

If anyone wants the files from one of the authors or has other

The ORDINATOR system is still operational (though it has not been used

I always knew that CP/M was not immune, but I really see no way to make
a virus general enough to infect *every* CP/M system. For example, the
boot drive on my DECmate is drive E:, not A:, and most of CP/M is stored
in a file. So you couldn't infect my system by just scribbling all over
track 0 of drive A:.

While it is true that uC magazine is gone (and much lamented), they are still
selling their products for Kaypro and other CP/M machines.  A friend recently
purchased their PRO 884 MAX ROM for his KP-4/84.  uC also markets a decoder
board to permit up to four floppy drives on the KP.  Their mail address is:
                
                        Micro Cornucopia, Inc.

                        Bend OR 97709

Another possible source of KP stuff is:

No, UniForm was never produced for the Attache'; however, Mycroft Labs, Inc.
P.O. Box 4106, Tallahassee FL 32315, (904) 385-1141, produced a program  
called COMPAT which performed the same functions.  As I recall, it only

There's a program called READ-PC.PAS, written in Turbo Pascal, at SIMTEL-20
in the directory PD2:<CPM.DSKUTL>READ-PC.LBR.  It was originally written
for the H-89 but it uses standard BIOS calls so it won't take much to get
it going on any system that uses IBM-style MFM floppies.

I've made a few changes to the version at SIMTEL-20 to make it a little
more portable and to fix a few bugs.  The source will be available for
anonymous ftp at ccu.umanitoba.ca as file pub/cpm/read-pc.pas for the next
couple of weeks.

    I will be happy to copy my C/80 v3.0 and MathPak manuals, for copy

    Sorry- my system is 8-in. only. I can print out the directories of
    the distribution disks.

    An ex-colleague at Scientific-Atlanta was going to use c/80 for
    embedded _8080_ code (I think that c/80 _only_ speaks 8080).
    The manual has some references to this, mainly: (1) full-service
    assembler/linker/locater needed (natch), and (2) I/O libraries
    were _not_ guaranteed ROMable (i.e., roll your own). I will try
    to find out how it worked.

    I have used the MATHPAK for simple antenna computations (tracking
    patterns), and found numerical agreement with the same code in
    the Data General MV4000 C. (Ain't fast, tho!! I _strongly_
    recommend a RAMdisk for compilation.)

    Hope that was some help.  I am also interested in this.  I hope
    this note wasn't too rocky, being my first .article.

You use a newer uncrunch program called "ucrlzh11.com" in
CRLZH11.LBR.  I believe it's in PD:<CPM.ARC (Don't hold me to
this)>CRLZH11.LBR.  The *.?Y? uses the LZH compression method.
If you like I could send you a copy of the program.

Howdy,

Just started reading comp.os.cpm to see what the current state of CP/M
is.  It doesn't look too far from where I last used it in '86.  I am
interested in using it some more to delevop some code that will run on a
Z80 based controller.

I have used BDS C on systems an undergrad in college.  I thought I could
recompile the libs and stuff so I could generate ROM based code.  I
looked on simtel and they did not have the whole thing.  Anybody know
what ever happened to Leor Zolman?  Or where I can get a copy of BDS C?

I could use a cross-compiler that runs on a PC instead if it could
generate ROM based code.

Any other comments on other Z80 code generating C compilers floating
around would be welcome too.

Hmmmm...  For that matter any info on the licencing status of CP/M would
be welcome as well.  I have a real live legal copy that came with my
Altos a while back, but I gotta wonder if it is PD these days or if
there are any PD clones of it around.  I have Z80mu that I run on my PC
sometimes, but wonder if there is a PD CP/M for Z80 machines around.

Thanx in advance.

P.S. If there is an FAQ for this group, could someone please email it to
me??

 CP/M is not public domain. The major components of CP/M
are
1) Utilities..ASM.COM, etc. There are public domain upgrades to most
of these.
2) CCP  the command line processor. There are several z80 and 8080
replacements/enhancements to this.
3) BDOS  the guts of CP/M. There are several z80 replacements in
SIMTEL20  PD2:<CPM.BDOS>. I don't know of any purely public domain
8080 versions. I have for example a dis-assembly of the DRI BDOS
but it is not public domain.
4) BIOS  this comes from the computer maker, or from you, adapted
to your machine.

There are also some integrated "ZCPR" packages for particular machines.
If you want to roll your own public domain verisons, you may need some
effort producing a bios, and producing a MOVCPM that will relocate
your "CP/M".

If you want a legal copy of CP/M, check garage sales, versions for
Apple or Commodore. As far as I know, sales to individuals of  
CP/M 2.2 or 3.0 are no longer possible in the US.

I have a Xenix system I take care of that uses a Z280 at 20MHz to

It's supposed to do upto 57kbaud on 32 ports but I don't have

They're still alive and kicking (at least, in their later incarnations).

In the early '70s we had an assortment of minis, tied together with point-to-point
"links", running initially at about 256Kbaud, and latterly at 2Mbaud.  These
links were full-duplex flow-controlled, with error detection (parity and
positive/negative acknowledgement).  The machines included several Interdata 70s,
a dozen or so 74s, a PDP-8, a PDP-9 and a PDP-15.  Originally they all ran their
usual operating systems, but around 1976 we added a big (67Mbyte!) disc to one of
the 70s and converted it to a file server.  At first it just did file storage and
transfer, but by the early 1980s we had converted the 74s to be discless clients
which booted from the central server (thanks to the AUTOLOAD instruction) and then
relied completely on it and a separate compute server (another 70).  Meantime
the PDP-8 had been retired and the 9 and 15 converted to use the central server as
a virtual-DECtape server as well as a file server.

Since then we've converted the links to a 2Mbaud CSMA/CD network which provides reliable virtual circuits in the firmware, added 60-odd 68K-based machines, retired
all the Interdatas and the PDP-9 and 15, and added several new 68K-based file servers.
There's nothing left now of the original hardware, though for a while around the mid
'80s it was all running happily together.  In fact, the last "link" board was removed
just last year when we switched off our 780.  The file access protocol is still the
same, though, more or less, as that used in 1976 -- the only difference is that the current servers don't understand some of the more baroque block-size constructs needed
to get the virtual DECtapes working sensibly.

It's a stateful protocol, btw, with user validation done by the servers on the basis
of link- and VC-specific tokens issued by them in response to the initial logon request.
Just what's needed, in fact, to deal with a labful of students all doing operating systems practicals.

It thought that Digital Research withdrew all of its support for
CP/M years ago.  I would think that they would have relinquished
their rights because they don't support it.  If they still
distribute it, but don't support it, then something is SERIOUSLY
(IMHO) with DRI's policies, mainly because most of its work is
devoted to DR-DOS and GEM-86 and GEM-68k.  Anyone care to rebut?

Thanks in advance.

I read a few years ago (don't remember where offhand) that DRI had put CP/M 2.2
in the public domain when it was no longer viable as a commercial product and
possibly also so they could back out of supporting the system.
CP/M 3.0 retained full proprietory material status and continued to be sold.
Two questions:
1) Is this true?
2) how much of the material was actually released to PD?

    ture, but there are other nasties you can do, like allocating
disk space to hidden files, tagging on a few extra blocks to .COM
files, and even twiddling stuff in the directory so text files will
be scrambled in chunks of 128 bytes.
 
   but whatever you do, don't try this at home...

The Zilog Z180 is available to 10MHz, Maybe a 12MHz 64180 can be had from
Hitachi (?). I've seen the info booklet on 20MHz Z80 from Zilog. It looks
like a nice piece of work. Don't know anything about delivery times yet, but
it ought to be available by now.

The crystal oscillator is run at 20MHz but this is divided by two to give
10MHz to the actual works. In preliminary product specs a 16MHz version was
mentioned, which would be clockable at 32MHz. In later literature only the
10 MHz version remains. Actual execution is faster on a Z280 than a standard
Z80 at similar speeds because of pipelining and caching. There is also an
option to use a 16-bit data bus. The Z280 in system mode can be (very almost)
100% code compatible with the Z80. Any code that relies on the R register
being incremented every opcode fetch will not work, because all 8 bits of
what is stored there with LD R,A remains unchanged until the next LD R,A or
system reset. There is a whole wealth of new instructions and addressing modes,
some of which are more useful than others.
The Z80-bus (8-bit) hardware interface is slightly less than actually
compatible. The main difference is that M1L signal is output only during
IM0 interrupt acknowledge or RETI instruction fetch. (no other fetches).
The refresh rate can be programmed but there will not be a refresh at the
end of each opcode fetch, as with the Z80. Also the lower 8 bits of the 
address bus need to be demultiplexed from the data bus. Single-stepping and
other hardware traps are supported. A third interrupt mode provides more
flexibility.
Most of the time these differences won't actually matter, and should even make
design easier.

What does this mean to Advent ROM owners?  Have their products been given

When I came to Australia, Two years ago, I had to deal with a Corvus Omninet

It ran a bunch apple II's.  Yuk, but It could connect up to IBM PC's and
other computers as well.  I understand (now) it was a type of RS422 hdwe

Well, I bought two 2-84's, just as you describe.  Both have SSDD drives for
191K and I just put in a copy of my Microcornucopia ROM and have installed a
360K drive with no probs. . .   I'm not too sure about copying my ROM like that

about.  I do also have a 2x (that's right, 3 of 'em!) and it came with the 'U'
ROM, so that came with DSDD drives..  On simtel you'll find the Tinkerkit.
It has alot of code in it, if you're a real nut case (like me)  
I can send you a copy of my U ROM if you like, but you may want to go up to
Quad drives instead.  I did, it saved me alot a space; makes disks go further.
No prbs with using DSDD floppies yet either.  780K IS worth it. Especially if
you have no HD. . .

As far as I know, you don't need to modify a thing.  All the '84 computers had
the same PC I believe.  Just lacked some parts for the SASI interface, int
modem and Clock.  At least my 2 '84 went up to 360 K with ONLY a ROM and drive.
It still lacks the stuff I put into my 2x (SASI, MDM, RTC)

Hi:

Last year I bought Cross-16 from Universal Cross Assemblers in CANADA.
I used it for Z80 code development on a PCXT to be used with MT-Basic
on a NSC-800 based STD-Bus computer.  Everything worked fine.

UCA now has a Cross-32 Assembler they are offering to me for 99US$
The retail price is 199US$, but I still believe Cross-16 is 99$.

They not only compile for the Z80 and 64180, but for over 30 processors
total.  It's table driven, so you can do your own too.  The info
is: UCA  POB 6158, Saint John, NB CANADA   E2L 4R6          Tel 506 847 0681

Tell'em Ronn sent ya.   If you're too cheep to buy your own, I can sell
you mine maybe. . .  Or if you're in a hurry.

Well, I saw alot of nice brochures on their Z80 stuff about a year ago.
Looked like they had a great co-processor board for the PC (Blue Thunder?)
That seemed like the ticket for cross/Pc-host code development.  Considering
all the guff in c.o.cpm lately about Z80MU, I'd try to run a co-processor
and get Hi-Tech C on it to do the C code. . . .  That'd be about 1K bucks??

Maybe, that would be affordable by a code developer.  I wouldn't mind it
personally :-)

That's a good questin.  Someone wrote earlier that Bridger
Mitchell wrote some of the code in the TurboROM (Bridger, if
you're out there, please correct me if I'm wrong, or someone!);
if that were the case, then Plu*Perfect wold probably still stock
it.

Message-ID: <60822@bbn.BBN.COM>

I am in the process of getting a Northstar HSIO (serial interface) board
working on a Cromemco System Three (S-100 bus with a Z-80).  The CPU board
apparently produces a 4MHz clock, while the serial board expects to be 
clocked at 2MHz.  I could adjust the baud rate specification by a factor 
of 2 (yielding 1200 baud when I tell it to run at 600, for example), except
the 8251 is only rated to run up to 2.4MHz.  The 8251A is rated for a
maximum of 3MHz, so a chip upgrade won't help either.

Des anyone know if there is a faster version of the 8251 available?  My
information comes from the 1987 ediiton of an Advanced Micro Devices data
book.  The part must be a drop-in; if I have to do any cutting I may as 
well just build a new board.

Digital Research no longer supports CP/M, but they have sold the rights to
another firm that still has copies of CP/M 2.2 and 3.0.  I believe the name
of the company is "Johnson and Lord", and they are located in the Pacific
Grove or Monterey area.  This firm still sells 8 inch floppies containing
vanilla CP/M, with all of DR's documentation.  No specific vendors' ports are
supported; you'd have to go to the vendor for support for their particular
version.  Prices are also reminiscent of DR's.

By the way, they offer no support or update policy on the software.

It's been long enough that I am unsure if I got the name of the company
correct.  I'll try to dig up the correct name and telephone number for them
and post them later.

I just stumbled out of the Amiga news groups and was stunned to find 
comp.os.cpm.  It's been over 3 years since I used my Osborne 1 much.  
This group brings back very fond memories.  I have just loaned Ozzy to 
my girlfriends father (not father-in-law yet, hence conditional loan ;^) 
He is recovering from hip-surgery.  Now is his chance to learn about 
computers and what better way to start.  I was wondering what is new with 
the Osborne in the last 3 years.  

- Is there anything new in the way of WP or spreadsheets?  
- I have Oterm and I think I have ZCPR (minor enhancements to CP/M?).  
  What does ZCPR3 have in it?  
- What is in QTerm and what are the overlays?

Thanks,

I've spent years with CP/M and Z-System machines & software, and I still
use both my BigBoard I  and several SB180s running Z-software.  The BigBoard
has been lobotomized to boot up as a terminal for the other systems.

Anyway, when the urge arises, I do my software & hardware hacking on my
Amiga 500!  The system is ultra-open, and allows all sorts of hardware &
software hacks, with color video, and 4-channel sound.  A real deal
for $500., comes with floppy, 1 Meg Ram, now bundled with the AmigaVision
audio-video authoring s/w which is pretty decent.  Also, the O/S is virtually
all on the ROM (256kB), so you get to use more than 93% of the RAM. For
mouse-haters (and Mac-haters)like me, you almost NEVER have to use it.

I have no connection with the mfr., I just like to play with this machine.

YAY!!  The TurboROM is too darned good to die!

By the way, I have written an overlay for David Goodenough suite of
UUCP-type programs for CP/M that uses the ZSDOS/ZDDOS time and date
system calls to read the clock.  It works with current release of
these programs.  I have been unable to get in touch with David to see
if he would like to include it with his distribution, so, if anyone
would like to use it, send me email, and I send it to you.

Well, let's see what I can rember.  We had one of these installed in
high school, and I was a consultant* there too, only I worked more on
the prime, but that is a different story.  All of this is from memory
of a user, so someone can correct my errors :-)  The last time I went
back and visited they had replaced it with a NOVELL (sp?) and had some
macs and a couple IBM's too.  The lab was installed in 1982; I graduated
in 1986.

* Consultant to other students, aka lab assistant during one class hour.
My supervisor was the system administrator for the instructional computing
facilities at the highschool.

What I rember was 3 stackable boxes about 9x15" of various heights,
one was the network interface (2-3" high), one was the VCR backup
attachment (one board in a 1" case), and the disk itself (actually
two drives, 40MB???? each?, 5-6" high).  I rember the apple in the
office was special, but I don't rember if it was in the datapath to
the drive or not (probably not, as you could run regular applications
there too).  The lab consisted of 30 apple ][e's connected via 2 wires
to a common bus line.  Connections to the bus were made with T boxes
and a 2 pin 1/8" phone plug.  

Each apple had a board in slot six (so you could boot from it), if you
used ctl-reset you could abort the network boot.  There was user
login (with password) and you were given one or more pseudo-floppy
disk volumes which booted a slightly different apple dos.  Actually,
you had drives one and two on slot six and volumes 1-255, so you play
games.  Each apple also had a local floppy drive installed in slot four
for user access and program storage.

There was also support for apple pascal, you could boot and run
it off the network, including accessing multiple volumes (this
is where I took my first stab at pascal....)  

It took some time to get reliable VCR backups, which took about
45 min to record and another 45 to verify (we found that the early
ones with random VCRs were not doing any good, and bought a VCR
for our sole use).  

Probably the thing I rember most is patching basic software to
support the multiple volumes so the program and data would be
on the shared read-only disk, but the data would be written on
the disk in drive 4).  The other thing I rember doing is going
around and booting some wordprocessor at every station from
two floppies :-) (yes, we were licsensed for multiple copies).


Well, this is what I rember from a user's perspective.  If you
have specific questions, I try and rember, but no promises.

Sounds like a Corvus Constellation setup with the Corvus Mirror VCR backup
device.  Who says videotape data storage is a new idea :-)

Someone actually bought a Mirror?  Wow.

I'm not head-up on Osborne stuff, but I can tell you about stuff
in the CP/M world in general.

> - Is there anything new in the way of WP or spreadsheets?  

Nothing really.  I haven't seen anything new in WP or SS in the
commercial or the public domain sector.  The only newest WP stuff
I know about is WordStar Release 4.

> - I have Oterm and I think I have ZCPR (minor enhancements to CP/M?).

Are you talking about the original ZCPR?  If so, I know little or
nothing about the original.

>   What does ZCPR3 have in it?  

Now, on that subject, I can tell you PLENTY.  I have ZCPR33 (the
latest version of Z3 you can get for free; there is a ZCPR34, but
it's commercial, but I like ZCPR33 anyway) on my main CP/M
sysems, and it is nice.  It has named directory areas (not just
drive a, user 4 or such like that, you can name it ASM, DOWNLOAD,
GAMES, WHATEVER (pun intended).  And if you run a machine where
you could have several different types of terminals online like a
UNIX-type system can like I do, you can pop in a termcap for your
specific terminal.  But since the Ozzie probably is the type of
computer which has only ADM-3A type emulation (correct me if I'm
wrong), this will be of no worry.  But there are just too many
neat things to describe here.  If you're the type who likes to
get down and dirty for dirt cheap (like I am), then get ZCPR33,
which comes complete with source code which you can hack to death
if you want to (just kidding, Jay).  Or if you wish, you can get
NZ-COM which will automatically install itself.  I can't tell you
a thing about NZ-COM because I've never used it and don't own a
copy, but most people here say it's a great product.

> - What is in QTerm and what are the overlays?

Qterm is a nice little terminal program with all flavors of
Xmodem, including 1k-Xmodem, Modem7 batch with 128- or 1024-byte
packets, Ymodem (the true implementation to Forsberg's
specifications), and Kermit (haven't used this one much, but it
works just fine with the UNIX system I call from time to time).
Plus it has VT100 emulation and a VERY powerful scripting system.
All this in a program that resides in almost 16k of memory.  It
is written by David Goodenough, who is currently moving to the
west coast from the east coast.  He specializes in writing
CP/M utilities which are based on stuff you would find in UNIX.
His UUCP software is a good example.  I run a site with it, and I
am a beta site for his UUCP software, and have written drivers
for his UUCP/Qterm software.  You should check his stuff out.
Ranks up there with the likes of Irv Hoff, Ron Fowler, Jay Sage,
and others.

	I've used that compiler to program several embedded systems
including a "mini" logic analyzer, a voice <-> RS232 box, and a general

assembler in critical areas.  C/80 and the NSC800 make a nice combination

Well, I know that most of P*P's stuff like DosDisk, etc. needs the Turbo ROM
Which I don't have, of course, so I would have assumed that BM has contacts
with the TROM at least.  He could get hold of the rights if he wanted to.
Anyways, what is in that ROM as compared to others (like my PROMAX 884, by uC)
Does the Code come with the Turbo ROM?  (Some how doubt it, as usual)  The uC
ROM didn't come with code.  How much was the Turbo ROM?

Also, on a tangent here, and related to the dead networks thread. . .
I recall that there was a Kaypro network out there some time ago, right??

I remember using a Corvus Constellation setup in H.S. too.  I remember
the servers came in 5, 10 and 20 meg versions (correct me if I'm wrong),
and that was pretty impressive when at the time an Apple ][ floppy
only held about 140K.  

Remember how when you booted up the Apple the constellation would appear 
on the screen in ascii "*"s...

Well, like I said, the Ozzie company here (my previous employer BTW :-) )
had the Omninet. . . They had one 10M server and a mirror, which was not
utilized; It was just 'around'.  Anyways - -  You could run Different net OS'es
on it.   Since it was basically RS-422, I guess the specs were pretty easy to
find.  Our problem was that we had the Constellation II software, an upgrade I 
assume from the C I product.  It used pipes to send files & things between
apples & IBM's, etc. . . I have seen a card since for an NEC APC (!?)
 Talk about a beast. . .
Well, that was basically our problem; because Novell had a package of Netware
to run on the Omninet.  Unfortunately, we had the CII software from Corvus, 
which had just gone under.  I couldn't find anything to help me use the system
and the rest of the site (Winery) was going headlong into Appletalk and since
Mac IIcx's, I got frustrated and left.  How can you do control on a shoestring
like that? 
It would have been nice to do Arcnet.  I understand that's a good deterministic
system.  Would have been just right for controlling gear remotely, although
there was another net (by Proteon?) called 10-net ???  I was impressed by that.
What has happened to it?  I could seal off sections of the net and if 
connections where completely broken, you'd have two separately operating systems
Sounded great, but was $$$. . .

   We are running a CP/M BBS (Z-Node 62) here in Perth, using Z-Msg
as the main BBS program (with BYE, of course, amd my own Fido software).
Now, Z-Msg has a few problems when run with Fido, most of which we've
managed to work around, but it would be nice to fix it properly, either
with the sources (if available), or an updated version. What's the latest
version of it? (I think we're running 1.5 or 1.6). And is there any way
we can contact Tim Gary, author of Z-Msg?

Thanks,
....Ron

Sorry, I have seen extraction programs for both types, but nothing
that will make them (for CP/M at least). I suggest you try posting
to comp.os.cpm, and see what the response is.  I would be interested

Proteon 10-Net is an 802.5-style token ring, essentially like IBM Token Ring

No kidding!  That's why the source code is out there.  Let's just call it
"hacking it to life."  That's how all this started for me.  There were some
things in ZCPR30 that I thought could be improved, so I started

David is in the processing of moving to the West Coast.  I too
have written a clock overlay, but for the CompuPro System Support

one has been already written by Dave Goodman.  He and I are both

Subject: Anyone Built and Used CMODEM?
Message-ID: <60896@bbn.BBN.COM>

Now that I have the HSIO (many thanks to those who responded) working, my 
attention has turned to terminal emulation and file transfer software.  

Included with the commercial distribution of BDS C is the source for a 
program called CMODEM.  It claims to implement the MODEM7 protocol, which
Jay Sage told me is also known as XMODEM.

I've successfully compiled and linked CMODEM, and the terminal emulation
component seems to work well enough (I'm using it to enter this posting,
for example).

When I attempt to transfer files from various boards that support nMODEM
(where n is X,Y, or Z), I get nothing.  I tell the remote host that I want
to do an XMODEM transfer, escape to CMODEM's command level and tell it to
receive the file.  It sits there doing retries, showing no errors or
received packets.  Aborting the transfer from my end, using ^X, and
returning to terminal mode shows that the remote host received the abort
signal (a pass-through of the ^X I typed, according to the source) and 
is waiting for me at command level.

Has anyone here successfully built and used CMODEM?  Perhaps I'm specifying
the wrong protocol to the remote host (Jay indicated that specifying XMODEM
*without* batch mode or 1K mode was the way to go; I tried 128 and 1K, CRC
and checksum in various combinations).

Proteon proNET 10 is still a popular networking product.  It's simple to 
program, has low overhead, and performs faster than 16Mbit IBM Token Ring
due to the low amount of overhead.  Banyan Vines, Novell and a bunch of other
network operating systems all support it.  So do quite a few large university
networks Watstar (ours is 450 nodes), TCP/IP stuff at Purdue and MIT, and
the Free University of Holland (Taunenbaum's home).

ProNET 10 is cheaper than IBM Token Ring, and pretty similar to good Ethernet
cards.

Programs like COMPAT (from Mycroft Labs) and Uniform (vendor forgotten)
convert Kaypro to MS-DOS and vice-versa.  I looked around for a way to
convert to Apple II disks, but was basically told it was impossible because
their disk drives are just so different.  (Someone once told me they basically
treat a disk drive as a direct-access cassette tape, whatever that means
--no flames please--).

Best bet for the Apple is to set it next to the Kaypro, get out
the trusty old null modem cable, crank both RS-232s up to 19.2 kbps,
and start a YMODEM/Batch file transfer.

Message-ID: <0093FEA471A692A0.00000111@dcs.simpact.com>

Sorry for the net bandwidth, but messages bounced:

I re-wrote the cmodem program extensively under BDS C 1.5, and have
ported it to five or six (very) different micros at one time or another.
It is usually the first thing I bring up on a new CP/M box. (It has got
steadily more modular over the years, and each successive port has
been easier as the dependencies have been localised!)
 
If you like, I can mail you the source; it runs under 1.5, not 1.6, but
1.6 comes (as I recall) with a 1.5 lib.  You might find it easier to
bring up than the standard version, and it has options to mess with the
RS 232 port control lines, cycle port parameters, and so on, which ease
communication debugging. 
 
Good luck - Will

   version 3, perhaps, but they stopped marketing 2.2 many years ago, 
and i haven't seen any new packages that include 2.2 code, and they
don't support 2.2 anymore, so i guess according to pournelle's
guidlines, it's psuedo pd.
 
   at least, i highly doubt that DR is going to sue you because you
copied a boot disk for someone...
 
   but remember, the bios is the property of the company that wrote it,
usually the manufacturer of the machine, and they can be somewhat sticky
about this...
 
   case in point - Trisoft now holds the rights to pickles and trout
cp/m for the radio shack model 2, 12, and 16.  radio shack stopped
producing the last of the machines perhaps 1 or 2 years ago, and has
stopped supporting the z80 machines (2, 12) altogether, but trisoft
will still sell you a virgin copy of cp/m 2.2 for $125.

I tried mailing this.... but as I expected with a from address like
the one given, it bounced.  Sorry about the wasted bandwidth --
perhaps that particular BBS would care to fix up the from line so
that it is a propper domain address (if this BBS (Actrix) can
manage it, I don't see why everyone else can't).

I know a reasonable amount about the Amstrad CPC128 (which I presume
is the machine you refer to).  I have owned one for about 5 years,
and still think it is a good machine.
 
There is not a hard disc available for the 6128, to my knowledge.
There was talk of one, a while back, but I think it was going to
cost about twice as much as the computer :-)   The other Amstrad
8-bit models (PCW8256, PCW8512 and PCW9512) have a hard drive
available for them.
 
Does that help?   BTW, if you are running out of storage space, you
might consider using a large capacity ("1MB") 3.5" or 5.25" drive,
and RAMDOS.  That should give you 800K to a disk, which seems huge
compared to the 178K you normally get.   If you are worried about
the speed, you might consider a ram disk.  DK'Tronics used to make
one, but they have been bought out so many times I am not sure who
owns the name now.  I think it might be Ram electronics.

Assuming that it is a Z-80 based machine (display of ignorance here!), it
seems that it might be possible to get a HD kit from Emerald Microware which
uses a small daughter board that plugs into the Z-80 socket plus the WD1002-05
hard disk controller.  The one problem that might crop up would be the
software modifications to the BIOS.  I know Emerald has it for 2.2, but I'm
not sure about 3.0.  A telephone call should answer that though.

Ewen, would you care to comment?

Message-ID: <1542@doitcr.doit.sub.org>

Hello there, 

since I am very happy using NZCOM (CP/M 2.2 auto-installer) on various CP/M
machines, I have run across two systems that do make life hard, since some 
operating systems are only CP/M compatible in some respect.

It would be necessary for me to run NZCOM under MP/M, since my ZNODE 51
is originally a MP/M ALTOS machine and probably functions better with 
serving a different terminal for the BBS than the one used for boot-up.

There are a couple people who would like to purchase NZCOM, but cannot make
it work under MSX. If anyone (or more) know solutions to these problems,
please answer here or to me directly. I read CP/M news almost everyday.
 
Thank you - and keep on Z-ing!
 
Ciao,

This is actually a rather popular thing to do to a Rainbow. I just put one in
mine a couple of days ago (sorry, I can't claim years), but lots of people
have done it.

The only caveat is that when you do it your Rainbow will no longer pass its
power-on diagnostics. However, I came across this on comp.sys.dec.micro the
other day (I've not tried it yet, so I can't say what it is or if it works):

Certainly, I will comment :-)
 
The machine is definately Z80 based, so your solution might well
work.  Software modifications of the BIOS could be difficult, as
could be keeping up with the speed of a HD.  The machine runs at
4Mhz with one wait state (effective speed is said to be 3.3Mhz).
The machine does not support DMA, or Interupt driven Disk IO (the
floppy IO is done by polling the controller as is the serial IO --
both _cannot_ be done at the same time :-) 
 
I think the answer is that technically it might be possible, but
the only real way to approach the problem (from my point of view)
would be to build a seperate (Z80 controlled) Disk drive manager
(supporting Floppies and HDs).  That would allow an implementation
of DMA - and with big enough cache, reasonable amounts to be read at
one time.
 
Again, BIOS would be a problem.  I don't have source to it (though,
I may well reverse-engineer it one day :-) and the CPM 2.2
implementation on the Amstrad only allows for 42K TPA.  (The screen
on this machine is a graphics only one -- and it takes 16K!).
Amstrads are definately cut price machines.  One possible solution
(with expanded memory (of which I have 512K!)) might be to run CP/M
in a different bank from the screen.  Still, someone would have to
do a lot of work.
 
One final problem -- the HD would still cost more than the machine
:-)

Message-ID: <1990Nov21.013054.18342@ccu.umanitoba.ca>

Hello CP/M world...
	I recently got a "patched together" CP/M machine consisting of
2 8" single sided floppy drives, the guts of an Amdek composite monitor
an ASCII encoded keyboard and a single board CP/M unit called a "Big Board II"
made around 1982. It's a very nice single board computer with 2 serial
ports, composite video output, SASI and "mini floppy" (5.25"??) interfaces
and some other goodies. It boots fine with the CP/M 2.2 supplied and I can
format 8" disks up to 670K each. My question is:
	does anyone have the firmware to let this thing use 5.25" disks
	drives as well?
	has anyone hooked a hard drive up to one of these things?
 
I'm more than willing to hack with the guts of this thing if needed; they
were kind enough to also supply full schematics for the thing. I've been told
the "Big Board" design was widely copied by Osborne, Kaypro and Xerox for 
their CP/M machines.

It depends on what software you're using, and what operating
system you're operating it under.  If you're using ProDOS or DOS
3.3, then you might be able to get away with it at 19.2kb.  But
if you're using CP/M, it depends on the card and software.

I believe that this is normal behavior for a Kaypro.  At least mine
does this.  It worried me at first because I have another machine that
refuses to give me back the diskette when the led is on.  The Kaypro
doesn't do this.  One can remove the diskette if the little light is

The WD1771 FDC controller used in the Big Board is the same as used in
the Xerox 820 and is capable of using 5.25" floppies.  What needs to be
done is to cut the data transfer rate from the 8" rate (500,000K bps) to
the 5.25" rate (250,000K bps) and, obviously, accommodate the 34 pin
connector on the 5.25" drive.
 
If you can find someone with schematics for the Xerox 820, you can see
exactly how they did it.
 
Emerald Microware, 12470 SW First, Beaverton OR 97005 sells parts,
software, and/or a kit to install a HD in the Xerox 820, amongst others,
which would perhaps work with the BB.  Others may also.

Message-ID: <1990Nov21.042512.24932@ccu.umanitoba.ca>

I've seen in an old issue of "kilobaud microcomputing" an ad from
Digital Research stating that CP/M 86 could operate on an IBM
DisplayWriter. Does anyone have a bootable CP/M 86 that can
operate on a DisplayWriter? Also, if this is true, what CP/M software
is available? A friend has a nice unit he got for nothing and it makes
a nifty word processor, but if it can work as a computer as well...
that would be great. All he has with it is a self-booting word processor
disk which has only rudimentary DOS functions like delete file.

						thanks very much

We had an Apple ][ lab with a Corvus in elementary school; it was
installed when I was in sixth grade (1981).  The one thing I best
remember about it was how often it crashed, and how often we lost all
of our files.  I really hated the thing, I almost expected to lose my
files every time I went into the lab.  The year I graduated from 8th
grade they got a second Corvus (ack!).

I used to use the Apple monitor program to write short machine
language programs, and would save them on the Corvus using BSAVE.  The
computer teacher/sysadmin used to blame me for bringing down the
Corvus by writing binary files to it.

I've got a CompuPro 8/16 (will be acquiring another one in the
very near future) and I'm pleased with it.  It depends on what
hardware the machine's got and what operating system it runs.  I
suggest a look under the hood.  If it has a SPUZ card, and you do
mostly 8-bit applications, GET IT!  They use a Z80H clocked at
8MHz and it goes real fast.  If the machine in question has a
hard disk and/or an M-DRIVE/H, even better.  Those applications
will fly even faster.  However, if it doesn't have a SPUZ, the
main operatins system you have to buy for is CP/M-86.  Most
8/16's have either a CPU-8085/8088 or a CPU-'286, many of them
run Concurrent DOS 816 (which mine does).  But if your system
does have a SPUZ in it, and if you get your hands on another
SPUZ, you can have multiple 8-bit tasks running.  Right now, I'm
limited to one Z80-based task because I have only one SPUZ on my
system.  If the system has MP/M or CP/M-86, I dunno how to help
you there.

Good luck.

I have a friend with one of those Yamaha music MSX boxes.  I could get it from
him & beat it up.  Problem is, it has no disk drives, so that may slow me down.

Also, I've been in contact with two other MSX unit owners thru the

may have a goer here. . .  Get in touch.

CUG276 & CUG292 are C sources of Assemblers for the Z80 and 64180.
You can obtain them thru the C User's Group, or I can Email them to you.
They are PD and have been run thru a number of compilers already.  It's
easy to select which to compile for since all you have to do is uncomment
a define which selects your flavor of C.  Although I've had trouble with 
the 6805 assembler under Aztec CII 1.05 (still am struggling)
Your compiler needs calloc() which mine don't have!!!  Also, I have to 
define void as int type and rename getc & putc to agetc & aputc. . . ..

etc.

First, a blushing thanks for the kudo!
 
Taking things in a different order than you presented them:
 
      The results you are getting with COPY.COM and STAT.COM are
      obviously not right.  Their CRCs should be 62 12 and 4C ED,
      respectively.  If they are not, let me know and I will see that
      you get 'fresh' copies.
 
      The fact that your retry problem, during format, is 'portable'
      from drive to drive suggests a diskette problem - but not
      necessarily!  I have had some problems in the past on a Morrow
      machine, with the old Shugart single sided drives, that looked
      like a disk problem but the problem was really the drives sticking
      and not indexing properly.
 
      On the later machines, at least, the drive light (and motor) stay
      on for several seconds after disk access and then turn off.  I
      would assume that yours should do that also.
 
      In order to use QD drives you need to make changes to both ROM and
      BIOS.  There are/were a couple of outfits that had slightly
      differing versions: Advent's TurboROM and Micro Cornucopia's MAX
      ROM.  I hear that Advent has shut down (I have not personally
      checked that), but Micro C is still selling their stuff - just out
      of the magazine business.
 
By the way, when you 'pry the machine apart' to anoint the drives with
alcohol, check the ROM number.  It should be chip U47 near front center,
and the ROM number should be either 81-149-C or 81-232-A.

   something else i should have mentioned...  is it normal for the

right now, the machine has been sitting after booting for a good
half hour, and the led for drive a is still lit.   of course, the
led goes out when i turn the machine off.   if i access drive b, it
will do the same for drive b.

   A public 'thank you' to don maslin for sending me a boot disk for my
geriatric kaypro 2/83.   it's people like him who make this hobby worth
pursuing...
 
   But, i am having some problems that are very strange - unless they
are common to kaypro machines.  (which i am not)
 
   first, i formatted a bunch of blanks so i could put the 'master' in
a safe place.  during the format process, the machine had to retry several
tracks.  the most it had to on any single track was once, but still this
is somewhat unerving.  ironically, it has the same pattern of track retries
for a given disk no matter which floppy it's in.  by the by, i did this with
the 'mfdisk' multi-format program, selecting kaypro double density.
 
   well, each disk that formatted checked out with no errors, so that's
not critical...
 
   however, using the copy program (much like diskcopy in msdos) it crashed
rather beautifully, all kinds of trash on the screen.  however, an ESC would
bring it back to the CCP.  oh, it also beeps with each new helping of
screen trash.
 
   and last, but not least, STAT dies upon loading.  no error message, not
a peep.  loads and stops dead in it's tracks.  the reset button is the
only way out. (aside from turning the machine off and on...)
 
   PIP does work, and i used that to copy the system disk, as well as
SYSGEN to transfer the operating system.
 
   now, i know the disk heads are probably filthy from sitting in a
dusty warehouse for a good many years, which would account for the
problems formatting disks, so i'll pry the machine apart and spend
some time with alcohol-soaked Q-tips and maybe even a head cleaner as
a last resort, but i doubt dirty r/w heads would cause copy and stat
to crash like they did.  (whenever the heads on my trs2 mod 12 get
dirty enough to cause problems, i usually get a BDOS error, but never
a crash.)

   any help would be greatly appreciated...  i like this little machine,
now if i can get it to work properly, i'd like to add dsqd drives to
it.  anyone know where i can find a pd hacked bios for that??

Can anyone suggest any benchmark programs for CP/M computers,
such as Dhrystone, or something like the Norton "SI" program?

I guess the problem with Dhrystone is that it is really a
compiler/machine benchmark, and there is no standard C compiler
for CP/M.

To get things rolling:  My Z280 system and the Code Works Q/C Compiler,
modified to generate Z280 code, give just about 500 Dhrystones/second.

Didn't Dr. Dobb's have some of this type of thing in C some time ago?
I recall that the C User's Group might have had it alternatively. . .

I'll give it a look. . .

     Where are you inding these, Ian?  I'd love to find another

     I meant to ask you before... how does CDOS run on the CPU 85/88?
I've stuck my 8Mhz ( 161F ) board in a couple of times, and it's a real
dog here.  Loading it with the terminal in the bedroom along with the
system console REALLY slows the thing down.  Gotta call CompuPro and
get the PAL for my CPU 286 so's I can get rid of the 6 Mhz '286. 8-)

     According to CompuPro, you should be able to run 4 8-bit tasks
per SPUZ.  Are you sure you have the queues installed correctly?  What
version of SWITCH are you using ( I have several later, and may be
able to help ).  What version of CDOS?

     On the subject of MP/M-86 and CP/M-86, I have both operating
systems, along witht the CompuPro technical manuals.  Ran MP/M 8-16 on
my 8/16 until I picked up CDOS.

     Can I call my machine an 8/16?  I integrated it, not CompuPro.

     That's the way the D BIOS works.  The last drive selected STAYS
selected until you select another.  It's not dangerous, it's just the
way the ROM BIOS deals with the drives.

With the original monitor ROM in '83 machines the heads would also stay
loaded and the disks spinning.  That tends to wear out the floppy.
I don't remember how much of that is a problem with Tandon drives
and how much a problem with the monitor ROM, as I replaced both
in every Kaypro I owned.  At one time I had 4 of them, and now there
is only one left and it rarely ever gets turned on.  So this is
all from foggy memory.

There used to be a significant difference between different brands
of floppy disks when it came to how long they would last in a
Kaypro under heavy use.  I found that one of the cheaper brands
would have the media peeling right off the disk fairly quickly,
and saved several examples to demonstrate the point to anyone who
recommended cheap floppies!  You could see right through the
worn areas!

Hello world, as they say.   Doesn't anybody ever read my notes?
We, the Schneider/Amstrad CPC User Group of Munich, Germany, very well
support the CPC machines with their various RAM expansions and BIOSes.
 
There  i s  a harddisk for the CPCs. For all three types the same one!
It does cost more than the computer, but - it contains the 20 MB Harddisk
with a SEAGATE-type controller, an interface to handle the I/O plus a very
well written and very well serviced BIOS EPROM, enabling you to use a
quad density (80 Track souble sided) drive with three different auto-login
formats: Vortex (almost identical to ALTOS 5), a DATA-Format and a System
format. Drive 0 is normally drive A: and a 3" drive is expected. It is possible
to boot from any partition of the harddisk as well as from any disk.
 
It is necessary to have at least a minimum configuration RAM-disk by either
dktronics or (better) the same brand as the hard disk: 
DOBBERTIN Elektronik, Brahmsstr. 4, 6835 Bruehl, West-Germany  

I have been using my hard disk together with NZCOM and Z3PLUS since more than a
year now (I originated the idea then to the manufacturer) and I can only say:
You don't even notice anything else but comfort as long as you are in CP/M.
In Basic, some ill-behaved programs store their variables at a far too high
point in memory. But that had been a problem from the first day of computers till
today. As you might have guessed, it is possible to run 6128 Programs  a n d  
CP/M Plus on all three CPCs with this configuration. If you are using your 
computer regularly - go out and buy this delight for your nerves. I also have
an IBM-clone, but it's fan and hard disk are much louder and get on my nerves.
I just use it for mailboxing and word processing every now and then. 

Please - do spread the word. There are MEGABYTES of P.D. Software sitting here
ready to go out to any willing regional distributor at very little charge.
Keep Z up and going!
 
Ciao,

Message-ID: <7357@hub.ucsb.edu>

I'm not sure if "for sale" postings are appropriate to this
newsgroup... if not, go ahead and flame me and I'll learn
from my mistake.

I have a Kaypro 4 and an Epson Geneva laptop CP/M for sale.
I assume there is still interest in such machines based on
what I've read in the newsgroup. Although they certainly
served their purpose well in the past, I'm a 386 man these
days and have no real need for the two computers.

Both computers have all bundled software disks and most
manuals as well as some public domain stuff. Kaypro was
bundled with Wordstar, Perfect Writer, Perfect Calc,
Perfect Filer and also has dBASE II. Epson has Wordstar,
a spreadsheet package and a scheduler if I remember right.

The Kaypro had some problems booting up if I remember
right but the Epson ran fine.  They've been sitting in boxes
in storage for a while.

If interested, make me an offer I can't refuse.

The Kaypro monitor ROM has no provision for timeout on the disks.
Micro C's ROM and TurboROM both do.

I installed a TurboROM on a K-10, and once had a copy of the first
ROM that Micro C sold.  I don't recall that the BIOS needed to be 
changed with either of them.  Mind you I could be wrong on that,
but if I remember right all the code that handles disk blocking and
so on is in the ROM, all the BIOS does is call the ROM.  On most
earlier CP/M systems that code was actually in the BIOS itself.

You are right - at least mostly.  On the K10 with 81-302 ROM the drive light
and motor does timeout.  Whether this is in ROM or O/S I don't know.
On the KP-2X (81-292), only the drive motor times out.  The light remains on.

Rereading the Micro C manual strongly suggests that you are right.  I don't
now have access to the T'ROM manual, but it likely is the same.  I stand
corrected (and smarter!).

I should have stated that what I know applies only to the '83 versions.
Even the k-10 I had was an old one, so I don't know what was done in
the later versions.

If anyone is seriously interested in ROM's that handle DSQD disks I
could dig up the source code I've got (somewhere) for a ROM that
handles it.  It will work with 4 drives using the converter that Mirco-C
used to sell (still does?) or with just two drives.  It has some built
in routines to handle other formats, though I never used them.  I can't
remember what all else it did...

Has anybody out there in CPM land ever heard of a TeleRAM 3000?  I have such
a beast.. It is pretty cool.. A little portable deal that runs an early
version of CPM.  It has a little tilt-up 4 x 80 tilt-up display.  I got it
for free from the last place I worked.  It has a virutal disk drive built 
in that is actually bubble-RAM.. This stuff is super-non-volatile which is
good cuz it has been off for years at a time.. It has a version of BASIC, 
a Term program (teleTALK), CPM support files, and a coupla others.  It has
a RS232 and I have used the comm. program and called up BBS's, but the 
software doesn`t have X-modem but it does have it's own proprietary x-fer
protocol.  There is a connector on the back for a disk drive, but I don't 
have one....  The manual I have is copyrighted 1982 and the company is 
TeleRAM Communications Corporation...  The problem is that I have no way of
putting more programs in the thing...unless I type them in!  The whole unit
is about the size of a 3-ring binder..  Anybody know anything?...

Actually, the WD1002-05 has a sector buffer on board. The data is transferred
from the disk into this sector buffer, after which the host processor can
pull the data from the sector buffer at its leisure. DMA is not required, nor
are interrupts.

This begins to sound very interesting.  Can someone mail me the
address of Emerald Microware, and also the cost of this small
daughter board?  The design of my machine (Amstrad CPC6128) is such
that it should go in quite easily.
 
I am also interested in any comments that people have about the
reliability of this controller, and the sort of through-put that you
get.
 
Of course, then I have to find a HD... but that shouldn't be
difficult.  There seem to be a lot of oldish 10MB drives around NZ,
going cheaply.  Anyone know of a reasonable access speed for this
type of setup (I would be inclined to think that 65ms would be more
than fast enough).
 
Thank you all for your help.

Or, you can just grab some 1.2 MB drives from an IBoringM AT. They run at
500 KHz, so should work just fine.

And he/she/it was absolutely RIGHT!!!    You ex- little s*&%.  :-)
The BSAVE command takes several optional arguements.  There are two 
numbers to include at the end that specified volume and directory on a 
system such as the Corvus.  If you left them off, you ended up saving your 
machine language right on top of the directory structure on the corvus.  I 
saw students do this when I was student teaching.  If only there had been 
a manual around, I could have told them what to type in or at least have 
told them it wouldn't work and why.  As it was, they were using some 
program that would calculate the numbers automatically and it worked great 
for the standard (disk in slot 6?) setup, but didn't append the extra 
numbers for the Corvus.

It is definately normal behaviour on my Amstrad (CPC6128) -- but
only the B drive. This has something to do with the minimal decoding
internally in the machine (I never bothered to trace it down in the
circuit diagram).
 
I would say that in most computers it is safe to remove the disk
when the little light is on, so long as you are _sure_ it is not being
accessed (and, obviously, that there are no open files on it --
especially for writing).  I usually listen to the motors (I have
5.25" drives) to tell when the disks are no longer needed (and of
course keeping an eye on the program that is working).

Of course, there are a few occasions when you want to remove the
disk while it is being accessed..... :-)  [Yet another comment about
computers which follow instructions too literally!]

I must admit that I didn't recall you mentioning a HD.  I did try to
reply to your earlier messages, but the mail bounced (althougth
this  return address looks _much_ better).

Now, that sounds very interesting.   Both the HD, and the ram-disk.
Could you mail me more information about the ram-disk (I already own
the dk'tronics one but I have a friend who would be very interested
in the one you mention).
 
The HD is also interesting - but costing more than the machine, I
don't think that I can afford it.  Infact, I would rather go out and
buy a '286 or a '386 given the price difference (they are here for
NZ$3000 compared to the cost of the Amstrad CPC for NZ$1200).  This
is mostly due to the terrible support that Amstrad recieves in NZ.,
and the fact that most people here own PC clones.

> I have been using my hard disk together with NZCOM and Z3PLUS [...] 
I was considering the purchase of NZCOM or Z3PLUS, but I wasn't sure
how well it would work with the machine.  I am already having
trouble with the BIOS patch for the dk'tronics ram disk (under CP/M
Plus). Do you have any replacement patches suitable?

I am interested in this.  Do you think it would be possible to put
some of the programs onto 5.25" floppies if I were to mail them

Actually, the throughput of HDS is slightly (10%) higher since the original
Kaypro s/w was pretty inefficient, despite the fact it was only targeted
at a one drive, 10M hard disk.  With Winchester Connection (the s/w which is
attached to HDS as well as part of all KayPLUS ROMs), you can handle any hard
drive from 5 to 64M (up to 2 hard drives).  Note that the throughput of the
KayPLUS ROMs is 30% greater on hard disk than either MicroCornucopia or
TurboROM, and 25% faster on video.  Just different coding.

Yep.  65 is good enough for the WD1002; they are not all that fast anyway.

Hmmmmmmm, let's see - single sided, single density.  Why, that's a 241K byte

I think the BBII supported DS DD 8" drives. So on
a IBM HD drive you could get about 1.2 megs depending on
your format. Zenith CP/M supported a 77 track x 2 sides x
9 sectors x 1024 byte format.

Floyd is part right: all blocking/deblocking of of disk sectors is done
in the ROM itself.  And, although you can use the original BIOS with two
of them (not KayPLUS - the third), why would you want to?  The original
Kaypro BIOS is pretty poor and makes some bad assumptions.  See below.

As far as ROMs, actually MicroCornucopia ROMS are pretty poor, but they
were the *first* Kaypro replacement.  Both TurboROM and KayPLUS are much more
powerful and flexible.  There is also no need to screw around with assembly
language in KayPLUS (and I think TurboROM, too), just run a configuration
program.

Regarding BIOS:  Kaypro assumed that you were in an 8080 world AND interrupts
do not exist.  (They wrote their BIOS in Z80 code, though, and used the
"back-side" Z80 registers.)  Bridger Mitchell (TurboROM) is better here in
that he understands that interrupts might exist, but ALSO assumes that one
lives in an 8080 world only.  In other words, the assumption is that IX and
IY registers are unchanged outside of your program.  KayPLUS does not make
any of those assumptions, especially since 90% of the CP/M computers are
Z80 and replacement operating systems (like QP/M or ZCPR) all exploit the
Z80 instruction set.

The most fun I have had in writing code has been the lack of understanding
about interrupts.  I like to use them because they improve throughput.  Even
early DBASE and Wordstar code fails on interrupt driven CP/M architectures.
Most code I have seen in CP/M in recent years has finally gotten much better
in its understanding of the processor and interrupts.

KayPLUS (MICROCode Consulting) is still sold by Emerald Microware.

Hey, what I said was that to use QD disks you don't *have* to change
the BIOS.  Thats is totally true, (I think).  As to why would one
want to use the original BIOS: only if you can't get or program a
new one.  I'll go along on that.

  I have a Big Board II, and was looking for some 1.2 Meg DSDD 8" floppy
drives.  I found them to be very expensive compared to 1.2 Meg 5.25" drives.
So I went out and bought a PC compatible (i.e. standard) 1.2 Meg 5.25" drive
and hooked it up to the BB2.  I now have a 1.2 meg floppy drive!  I figure
that a 3.5" drive should also work, but I haven't tried one yet.

  I had two problems, 1) the BIOS was assembled to support single sided
drives only, so I had to change a EQU and reassemble, 2) the 5.25" drives
don't usually provide a READY signal like the old 8" drives did, I just
hard wired this signal to ZERO (this causes a retry during formatting
when you switch sides, and may cause some when the motor has to start up,
but, I haven't noticed any problems.  The 5.25" drive is faster than the
old SSDD 8" drives, and a lot quieter (the motor shuts off too)!

That's because the Kaypro ROM does a physical write every time BDOS is
called to write a record.  There is an option in Kaypro's configuration
program (the Write Safe flag?) to turn this off, but Kaypro warns that
this might cause some programs to trash files.  This probably only
happens with files that aren't closed before the program exits.

I you want to use a parallel printer with a TurboROM, you have to use
the TurboBIOS.  It appears that the ROM entry point was changed (at
least for my Kaypro 2X, CP/M 2.2H).  Besides, you will need the
TurboBIOS to support hard drives, RAM drives, or 96 tpi floppy drives.
Or to use the Multicopy Turboset program -- lets you use almost any 5.25"
floppy disk format on your Kaypro without using memory resident software
like Uniform -- it sets up the disk parameter tables in high memory to
access other formats.  Also allows you to use DosDisk for accessing
MS-DOS floppies.  There is also a version of DosDisk for the KayPlus
ROM.  MultiCopy and DosDisk are available from Plu*Perfect Systems.
I don't have a current address for Plu*Perfect.  DosDisk is also 
available from Sage MicroSystems East, 1435 Centre St., Newton Centre, MA

Not many people are writing Z80 operating systems today (although
interesting applications such as background reminder calendars
continue to appear).  However, I think some clarification of Mitch's
comments is desirable.

I (and others) have long argued strenuously for strict adherence to
the following systems-programming guideline:

				 ****
  SYSTEM CODE (BIOS, BDOS, INTERRUPT-SERVICE ROUTINES, AND BACKGROUND
  UTILITIES)  SHOULD *ALWAYS PRESERVE* THE NON-8080 REGISTERS.
				 ****

This rule ensures that an application that uses Z80 opcodes can run on
any z80 system without having to save and restore any of those
registers before every BIOS and BDOS call.

Note that system code can indeed *use* the Z80 registers (the TurboRom,
BackGrounder ii, and ZSDOS, for example, do so extensively).  The code
must just push/pop or save/restore from memory any registers that it
needs to use.

A flagrant violations of this guideline is found in an early
version of the Osborne Executive rom, which used an index register
(probably IY) in a service interrupt routine.  Not even the smartest
application can safely use IY, since the interrupt is asynchronous,
and until a corrected rom was issued early owners were baffled to find
that some programs would simply not run correctly.

Another egregious case is the BIOS in the ON! computer, which uses af'
without preserving it.

This topic -- appropriate use of registers -- is part of the larger
subject I have called "environmental programming" and discussed at
greater length in a column in The Computer Journal.  Each programmer
needs to be aware of the computer environment in which his/her code
may be executing, and take appropriate steps to preserve that
environment.  Systems code has an especially heavy obligation to allow
applications to thrive; hence the abvove guideline.  But applications
also have responsibilities -- for example, to verify that the host has
the necessary resources (devices, type of BIOS, etc.) before executing
code that can crash or do damage on the wrong platform.

Subject: Speaking of benchmarks...

Hello!

I couldn't resist sending this message. I just came upstair to my room after
a long day at work, two hours of chorus rehersal, three hours of dinner
preparation and dishwashing, and putting my contacts into the enzyme solution
for a two-hour bath. BTW, I use Mac's at work.

I came into my room to write a littel letter on my QX-10. I turned on the
computer, still blind, and, behold, it finished booting before I even put
my glasses on.

Now, that's performance.

(I did cheat: I had to clean the glasses first, but, at work, I can usually
check my mailbox AND read all of the stuff by the time the sucker finishes...)

   -John, still slightly dazzled and very, very proud to be here.


P.S. Who cares if my modem runs at 300 Baud? I can drive home and read all
the messages here before the thingy at work boots and loads up the
emulator. (A little exaggeration never hurts, but I stopped using my
computer - not REALLY mine - as a terminal and just use a shabby old VT100
clone down the hall from my office. Will never happen with my - REALLY
mine - QX-10!)

Subject: Wanted S-100 boards
Message-ID: <5910@crash.cts.com>

     Hello, netters!

     I am looking for one of two S-100 boards.  Preferably used, but new 
would be OK.  Neither of these are still made by their respective 
manufacturers ( who are actually still in business! ).

     Anyway, the boards are:

     (1) CompuPro/Viasyn PC-Video board.  CGA or monochrome, makes no 
         difference which.  Preferably working, but, this too, is 
         negotiable.

     (2) Lomas Data Products Color Magic.  This is an IBM-compatible CGA 
         board.  Lives at the same memory address, control ports are at the 
         same address, etc.

     I would love to find the CompuPro board, because I have software to 
support it.  But either one will do.

     Might you have one of these lying around, that you're no longer using?  
If so, let me know!

     Thank you for taking the time to read this.

Subject: Where info for DEC Rainbow?
Message-ID: <4964@trantor.harris-atd.com>

	How can one best transfer DBASE files from a DEC Rainbow hard drive
to a DOS machine?

	Currently, I have no comm software for the DEC machine. Perhaps there
is a "boot" modem program available -- something simple that can be hand 
loaded to allow download of better comm software???

	Please E-mail answers...

	Thanks.
