	I have an Apple//c with a Z-80 installed inside to run CP/M.  I heard  
that there was TCP/IP software written for CP/M some time ago, but I don't  
know where I can get it.  I would like to use it to run TCP/IP on packet  
radio.  Does anyone know where I can find such a creature?

Hi, I highly recommend reading the latest issue of TCJ the Computer Journal,
it deals with a new ECB-based computer developed in Germany(!) by Tilmann Reh
In der Grossenbach 46   5900 Siegen.  It contains a 12 MHz Z280 with 6 MHz
bus to accomodate standard 8.bit externals.

Tilmann.Reh@hrz.uni-siegen.dbp.de  is his internet address.

Have a close look, it's a great machine, IDE bus 120 MB fixed disk is ready
and in test at the time beeing. Superfast output is possible through a rapid
HERCULES graphic terminal card also available.  Standard IBM keyboards and 
TTL monitors can be used.

Check it out, Z3PLUS, the Z-system for CP/M Plus is running too, since it
uses a modified standard CP/M 3.1.

Don't forget, this is the type of machine that can run the grand
and glorious UZI-280 Unix-clone operating system!!!

The Z280 is the ultimate 8-bit CPU.  People who buy Z-180 boards
are making a big mistake.

Yes, the PKARC or PKUNPAK works fine for renamed .ARK-files. For .LBR-files
I use the DELBR11.EXE form the directory <MSDOS.STARTER>.

My problem are the .?Z? files in the SIMTEL CP/M archives. I couldn't find
a un-crunch-routine running in MSDOS environment. In the file-docs about
CP/M archives is a UNCR232.ARC mentioned, which should do the un-crunch.
But I couldn't find it yet.

Any ideas ??????

Has anyone ever heard of one of these? We have a chance to pick up three of 
these for *cheap*, but they have no system disk--- so we're looking for one.
 
If you have such an animal, are you willing to part with it?
 
Any info on the Vector would also be great, such as what terminal emulation 
it uses, etc.  Thanks in advance!

I, along with a friend, am running a PICS 1.6 RCP/M in Tucson on a Xerox 
820-II with a 10 meg stock hard disk. The HD box also has a DS/DD 8" floppy, 
and we also have another drive box with DS/DD 8" floppies daisy-chained to 
the HD.
 
The system only recognizes these additional floppies as SS/DD. Does anyone 
know how to get it to use the full capacity of these drives? Also, is there 
a way to keep the drive motors from continuously running? We're going "24 
hrs" on feb 5, so the wear & tear on the floppy drives will be considerable!
 
Any help will be very much appreciated!

Anybody have either a news reader or mailer (or both) running under CP/M

I may get set up to use these things from my system.  An elm/nn compatible

Does anyone know of a readily available emacs clone that'll run on
cp/m?  It'd be ideal if it were on simtel20 or its mirrors.   
Barring that, does anyone have suggestions for a pd or cheap(<$20)
text editor that'll edit files larger than tpa WITHOUT having to
be TOLD to swap text or read more of the file?  I have Express 2.2,
which is a nice editor except for that one nuisance.  I don't want
to have to keep track of where in the file I am.  I want the editor
to do that for me! :-)

Figure 32 sectors of 128 bytes per track. Possible for 16 sectors
at 256, 8 at 512 and 4 at 1024, but these were uncommon.

Options 0 through 2 are unnecessary since you can usually find a machine 
free for the asking if you will spend the time and gas to pick it up and 
then a bit of effort to learn. How deep are your pockets? ;-) This leaves:

Except for the stuff about sector-by-sector reads. Just PIP it out the 
COM port. The machine will know how to read its disks and has no more 
interest in transmitting synch headers and other "garbage" than you have 
in reading it.

Todd, there isn't a reason you can't use an ARK file. Change the file 
extension to .ARC and use PKARC or equivalent. You might have more of a 
problem with .LBR files. For those, you want LAR4LBR.ZIP to break the 
files out of the library file and then UNCR233.ARC and/or UNLZHCPM.ZIP to 
decompress the files (extracting from libraries does not decompress in 
the same step).

The tools I mention are for use on your MSDOS machine.

Sure you can!  Just use PAK, or whatever your favorite .ARC tool is.  It will

           Trenton 1992 and the CP/M Conference / Banquet
                            Lee Bradley
                   (slightly revised by Jay Sage)
 
     We're going to try something different this year at the 1992
Trenton Computer Festival (TCF).  We will hold our regular CP/M and
Z-System Conference on Saturday, April 11, at the Mercer County
Community College campus along with the other TCF events.  Jay Sage
reports that he signed up to give a talk on ZEX ("I'm going to give it
a try.").  Coming from Sage, you *know* ZEX must be a challenge! 
Terry Hazen (ZP, ZDB, IOPCLK/LDR) and Paul Chidley (YASBEC) are new
faces we will see this year.  Don't know of any other scheduled talks
at the Conference, but if you think you'll make it and have something
you'd like to talk about, give Jay a call at 617-965-3552, and he'll
tell you how to get your talk on the agenda.
 
     The thing that will be different this year is that we're going to
have our own banquet and evening session!  We've talked about it for
years; now we are going to do it!  We contacted two Red Roof Inns, the
Princeton Hyatt, and a place Dan Mareck recommended called the Stage
Depot Motel in Pennington, NJ.  The Stage Depot Motel had the best
deal on room prices and banquet facilities.  We are therefore
recommending to all who make it to the Trenton Computer Festival this
year that they book their room at the Stage Depot Motel and join us
for our own Saturday evening "Z Fest" activities.
 
     The Stage Depot Motel is on Route 31 about 25 minutes away from
the Mercer Campus in Pennington, NJ (see the ASCII map below).  Their
telephone number is 609-466-2000.  When you call them (Joe Perry or
Steve Freidman will take your reservation) tell them you're with the
"Z Fest" party.  Room prices, including the tax, are:
 
            Single Double Bed / One person  39.59
            Single Double Bed / Two people: 47.08
 
            Two Double Beds / One person:   47.08
            Two Double Beds / Two people:   50.29
 
     We envision the following approximate schedule.  The TCF session
will run until about 4 or 5 PM on Saturday.  Then we will adjourn to
the Stage Depot Motel.  The Dinner/Banquet (which quite likely will be
an informal affair) will start at 7 PM (so don't dilly dally too long
at TCF!).  We will continue with a technical session in the banquet
room as long as there is interest.  On Sunday morning the Stage Depot
will serve danish and coffee in the conference room, and we can
continue with informal discussions.  Those who wish to can go back to
the TCF Flea Market for the remainder of the day.
 
     For further information you may contact Lee Bradley at
203-666-3139.
 
     Here is an attempt at a map showing where the Stage Depot Motel
is located relative to other landmarks for the TCF.
