Subject: Current version of ZSM

ZSM V2.3 _IS_ the "current" version of ZSM. It's been stable and frozen
for about two years now, although as time permits I will start to work
on V2.4 - there are a couple of enhancements that need to go in. However
if you've got a V2.3 (available from SIMTEL20 or rna@lakart.uucp)
you're about as up to date as it's possible to be.

For the gentleman at the University of Hawaii who wanted my address,
ask tbopp there (Tom Bopp) what he's using to reach me, alternatively
try one of the below. _DON'T_ reply to this: it'll wind up on lakart
(the UNIX machine at work). Send it to pallio, which is my machine at
home.

Subject: Plu*Perfect Systems and TurboROM

Bill Swan asked: "Be that as it may - the Kaypro in question is vanilla, so
where can I get a 'TurboROM' or 'KROM', and how much is *that*?  Also, do
you have an address for Plu*Perfect?"

First for the address of Plu*Perfect:

	Plu*Perfect Systems
	410 23rd Street
	Santa Monica, CA 90402
	213-393-6105 (evenings)

The TurboROM, developed by Plu*Perfect, is available from Advent at the
following address:

	Advent Products
	3154-F LaPalma Avenue
	Anaheim, CA 92806
	714-630-0446

Advent specializes in Kaypro computer add-ons of various sorts.  I believe
that the TurboROM costs about $60 and, from what I have heard from owners,
it is well worth the price: much faster and more flexible disk operations
and other improvements in the operation of the computer.

I am less sure of the K-ROM.  I believe that is the modified Kaypro ROM
offered by the publishers of MicroCornucopia magazine.  My feeling is that
the TurboROM offers a wider range of features and support.  For example,
Plu*Perfect sells a program called Multicopy that is like Uniform and allows
the TurboROM-equipped Kaypro to handle many CP/M disk formats as native
formats and to work with amazing speed.

Bridger Mitchell, the principal of Plu*Perfect, is a regular reader and
contributor to this newsgroup, but the current rules prohibit him from
promoting his own products.  I'm sure he will be happy to answer any
technical questions, however.

Subject: Sanyo MBC-3000 Help Needed

   My brother's Sanyo MBC-3000 (8" drives) system just failed again,
and it does not seem to be worthwhile to spend another couple of
hundred dollars to get the boards replaced.  Debugging is impossible
with that machine because of the asynchronous, dual-processor
architecture.  Besides, the performance was terrible because of the
way that architecture was implemented.

   The problem is that some important data is stored on double-sided,
double-density diskettes in the unknown Sanyo format.  I tried reading
them with an ATR-8000, which is pretty good at identifying and
accepting various 8" formats, but it refuses to read them.  Does
anyone out there have (or know of someone who has) an MBC-3000?  In
return for help in converting the data on the diskettes to IBM SSSD
standard format I would be willing to send them some of the hardware
(such as the PC board or boards) to keep as spares for when their
machine dies.

   I would also entertain any offers for the purchase of this hardware
(in case someone wants a couple of 8" DSDD disk drives, a good power
supply, a monitor, etc.).  If you want to make an offer, you had best
be in the greater Boston area.  What the MBC-3000 lacks in software,
it makes up in hardware.  It is a beautifully put-together machine
that used plenty of metal.  In short, it weighs a ton!  I would not
even attempt to ship it.

Subject: Televideo 802

   Can anyone tell me how to configure the serial ports (and other
hardware features) of the Televideo 802 computer.  I acquired one
second hand, but the owner had lost the manual and, I believe, the
diskette containing hardware-specific utilities.  I have only the
Digital Research CP/M diskette and diskettes with some application
programs (WordStar, The Word Plus, and so on).  The most immediate
problem is getting a serial printer working.

   From somewhere I had gotten a program called TVSET.  I don't know
if it works on my Televideo 803, but it does work nicely on the 802
and looks as though that is the machine it was intended for (it can
define a string for the 25th line of the display -- which the 802 has
but of which there is no sign on the 803).  If someone has any other
utilities that came with the machine, I would appreciate it if I could
get a copy.

The original version of Citadel runs on a Kaypro.  It supports something like
32 or 64 "rooms"; each room has a message system.  There is also a central mail
facility.  A room may have a directory and have file up/downloads.  I believe
that the last version that operated under CP/M that I know about was 2.15.

It was available from the C User's Group (they advertise in programming
oriented mags).  It's also on my system in the UNaXcess BBS at 814 337 3159

Here's the scenario...  Dusting out my closet, I have come across a pair of
North Star Advantages. One works fine, the other has a dead screen (tube is ok,
it might be the flyback) but, the CP/M system master disk is dead. I'd like to
get at least one of these things working again so here is the question... Does
anyone have a copy of the original North Star GCP/M that they would be willing
to part with for a reasonable price? Please?

Now for the other stuff... Is there a way to make these things work with soft
sectored disks? Hard sectored disks are getting hard to come by these days.

Any help would be appreciated.

I, too would like to hear about hooking up DRAMS to a Z280.
I currently have one using 128K of static RAM (32Kx8 chips)
in 16-bit z280 mode, with burst mode working on a 5-HHz bus.
I would like to go to a 10-MHz bus, but I would need to use
static-column DRAMs (256Kx4 parts) to get enough speed.

This system currently runs CP/M 3 with a 20 meg SCSI hard disk very well.

If you are thinking of building a Z280 system, get in touch
with me, and I can relate my experiences (and circuit diagrams, etc.)

 The people who first distributed the code (CRT & BAK) created an

   For those with an interest in Amstrad computers, here is the address
for a support group called the Amstrad PCW SIG:

Al Warsh, the director of the group, publishes a regular newsletter, the

the group are particularly technically inclined, but if you have an
Amstrad, this is the only place I know of in the United States to which

Subject: Help with UNSIT

Has anyone been able to make UNSIT unpack any of the SIT files made 
by the Macintosh? 

I didn't have too much trouble with UNPIT, but UNSIT just doesn't seem
to work properly.  I haven't tried it for quite a while, but from what I
remember, it always gave file errors about the header...
 
If ANYONE has been able to UNSIT ANYTHING, could you please tell me how
you did it?
 
I imagine that all you need to type is:
 
UNSIT filename
 
Is there something I'm missing out?

If it help, I'm using a Commodore 128.

 I used MEX with MP/M on an Altos 580 for quite some time, and found:
 Mex worked fine up to about 1200 baud, then gave up and lost characters.
 Sometimes, particularly after using x-modem, a "phase of the moon"
 type error caused mex to lock up that user when exiting to system.
 Sometimes the problem could be solved by killing the process from another
 terminals, and sometimes it was necessary to re-boot the machine.  I
 suspect this resulted from mex writing into the common memory above
 C000.

In the last "Livewire" magazine from GEnie, they mention QTERM as being
available.  They also mention there is a C-128 overlay.  I have downloaded
QTERM (from SIMTEL), but can't find the C-128 overlay.  If anyone has one,
it would be nice to get it up on GEnie and SIMTEL.
Please let me know if it is available ( I have looked on GEnie and
SIMTEL, and also have a Compuserve account), before I waste time 
reinventing the wheel!!

Much Thanks in advance - QTERM sounds great (using MEX now).

   We need to run the Microsoft MBASIC compiler BASCOM.  I have the
program (I am still looking for LINK, but I think the SLR linker will
do), but I cannot locate a manual and do not know the syntax to use.
Can anyone help with a quick rundown on the syntax and/or a reference to
a published book or article on the subject.  Thanks.

   This need, by the way, arose in my capacity as a Boston Computer
Society trouble-shooter.  Someone's accounting package, written in
Microsoft BASIC, suddenly stopped working properly.  The user has the
source code and, upon examining it, discovered an error in some date
processing steps.  Everything was fine until this month.  He thinks he
has the fix but must now recompile the code.

Subject: Interrups and CP/M on Apple ][

I have a "CP/M Card" made by Advanced Logic Systems installed slot 4 in my
Apple ][ Plus, and a Super Serial Card installed in slot 2.  I'd like to run
a telecommunication program under DOS or ProDOS with the SSC's interrupts
enabled, but find that turning on interrupts prevents CP/M from booting.
My guess is that the SSC is generating an inturrupt either when reset or when
CP/M initializes it somehow.  Does anyone know of a way to make the two
coexist, short of soldering on a toggle switch in parallel with the DIP
switch (for my particular system, it's too much of a pain to unstack all the
stuff that lives on top of the Apple, open it, take the card out, flip the
switch, and reassemble).

I do not have any source code for the CP/M BIOS or bootup code.

Many thanks in advance for the help.

Subject: NOVADOS bug report

There is a serious bug in Novados release H (and possibly earlier
releases as well) that crops up when the number of entries used in your
disk's directory becomes a multiple of 256. Symptoms include: all files
disappearing that are after then first 256 entries, being able to open
files that disappear when you try to close them, and two copies of a
file showing up in the directory, one with 0 blocks used. To make
matters worse, when the NovaDOS fast boot option was used, the problem
would vanish if the directory had fewer then 256 entries used when it
was initally logged in at startup. You could add files to your heart's
content until you crossed the 512 entry boundary, when half of your
files would promptly vanish. The incorrect code, taken from NVDS-2.Z80,
is shown below:
 
;
; NOVADOS CODE -- INCORRECT -- Set last file
;
setlf:  call    tstlf                   ; Test last file
        ret     c                       ; No then exit
        inc     de                      ; Increment last file
        ld      (hl),e                  ; << Save it in temp0
        inc     hl                      ; << -- argh! temp0+1
        ld      (hl),d                  ; <<        & temp0+2 !!
        ret                             ; And exit
;
; Test last file
;
tstlf:  ld      hl,(temp0)              ; Get pointer to last file 
        ld      de,(filcnt)             ; Get file counter
        ld      a,e                     ; Subtract de-(hl)
        sub     (hl)
        inc     hl                      ; <<-- now (hl) points to
        ld      a,d                      ;      to temp0+1 !!
        sbc     a,(hl)
        ret                             ; Exit
 
The correction is simple; store the hi byte first, decrement the
pointer, and store the low byte. The correct code is shown below (this
fragment was extracted from Z80DDISK.ZZ0, release 24).
 
;
; Z80DOS CODE -- CORRECT -- Set last file
;
setlf:  call    tstlf                   ; Test last file
        ret     C                       ; No then exit
        inc     de                      ; Increment last file
        ld      (hl),d                  ; Save it in temp0
        dec     hl
        ld      (hl),e
        ret                             ; Andd exit
;
; Test last file
;
tstlf:  ld      hl,(temp0)              ; Get pointer to last file
        ld      de,(filcnt)             ; Get file counter
        ld      a,e                     ; Subtract filcnt-(temp0)
        sub     (hl)
        inc     hl
        ld      a,d
        sbc     a,(hl)                  ; Carry means (temp0) > filcnt
        ret                             ; Exit
 
I went back to the old SUPRBDOS code to see if this bug could have
manifested itself in other derivates, including (shudder) ZRDOS, ZSDOS
or ZDDOS. The SUPRBDOS code was correct; so this appears to be a bug
localized to NOVADOS.
 
This has been driving me <<nuts>> for about a month now. Since I've
made extensive mods to NovaDOS to support some Z80DOS style
datestamping features (notably get/use file datestamps), I wasn't sure
if the problem was in NovaDOS itself, or my mods. Now I am! I found
it by painstakingly tracing through the reset disk, select disk BDOS
call sequence and narrowing down which piece of code was going awry.

Subject: 1581 Max-81 Format

There is a slight error in the 1581 MAX-81 format as published my Miklos
Gramskezky (in Transactor and in Twin Cities 128)

The error is in the DPH block (byte 20) of the drive table.  Basically 
what it involves is having the drive seeking track 80 in a (0-79 track 
system).  The fix is to change byte 20 from 90 to 8c this will restrict 
the drive to going from 0-79 and not access physical track 81 (which 
does not exist).

I found this and it was driving me nuts after I overfilled disks and had
to remove the disk from the drive or do a warmstart (^C) in order to 
read from that drive again.  You will loose 6K when you do a show 
command but that 6k wasn't really there anyways.
I sort of figured this when some disk utilities were showing 81 tracks @
1024 bytes per sector and I knew it should only read 80 tracks.. 
SHOW [DRIVE] didn't show this (and now reports 79 tracks) but 0-79 is 80
tracks in my thinking... Any further info needed

The memory that I have of Z80MU is that it runs on an 8088 and has
a ADM-3 "hard wired" in...

Is there a version that runs on a V20?  I would think that it would run
a _lot_ faster - my recolection is that Z80MU ran at about 1-1.3 mhz
(equivalent).  Also, is there any way it can be modified for a ANSI
terminal?  And talk to PRN: as if it was LST: ?  (I assume that COM1:
access  or being to "assign" C: to go to C:\CPMSTUF1 and D: to C:\CPMSTUF2
would be too much...)

My memories of Z80MU are at least 2 years old, and I only had a chance to
play with it for 20 minutes or so.  If a newer version is avialable, with
added features, please forgive...

	MOUSE is a stack-oriented, interactive language for Z-80s
	under CP/M.  Since it's only a 2K '.COM file it's great for
	CP/M laptops.  You can get it from Royal Oak (I1:) and
	other places with source and examples.

	In Grogono's book on the language he also provides a PASCAL

	and/or cut an interpreter for a different processor ?

Well, there was a bit of chat about it a while ago: getting UUCP up
and going under CP/M. After much testing by myself and my beta
testers [1], I am reasonably sure there isn't too much wrong with
V2.0h. I have therefore released it, you can get copies from the
rna server here at lakart.

/send index to <insert your address here>

will get the index of what's there, if contained in mail addressed to
rna@lakart.UUCP. If you just want to get the files, you'll need uucp
and zsm for sure, and qtpatch may help with patching for your system.

Although this is available at lakart, please direct any related mail
to the addresses below, since that is my CP/M machine at home.

Subject: Alspa Computer ACI-1/2 users only - BIOS bug

(Has the Alspa mailing list actually expired? I got no answer...)

While checking out Dave Goodenough's CP/M UUCP, I uncovered a bug in the
Alspa ACI-1&2 BIOS that apparently goes all the way back to the early
Alspaugh Engineering days (i.e., it's not *my* fault :-).

As I have been afflicted with various symptoms of this bug over the years,
usually chalking it up to the particular applications I was running, I
figure it worthwhile to share with other Alspa users on the net (and off,
but I know only one in that category).


The symptom, in general, is that an application running from one drive
fails to find all the files on another drive specified by a wildcard. I
have seen this with the above UUCP, with SHAR.COM, and a CP/M make. For
some reason I have not seen this with Alspa's D.COM.


The problem is caused by the BIOS density (disk format) routines use of
the 128-byte scratch directory buffer (DIRBF) as a scratch buffer for
reading track 0, sector 1, to determine the disk format encoded therein
at byte 7FH.

This causes the directory buffer to be clobbered between search-first and
search-next BDOS calls, and any matching but unfound file entries in the
buffer at that time will not be found.


Two fixes are possible. The first is to create a separate 128-byte buffer
for the "density" routines, so that only the BDOS uses DIRBF. The second
is a re-write of the density routines such that it is not necessary to
actually read the data into memory. (The Alspa BIOS is so tight that I
preferred the second.) Rather than list that change here, I will e-mail
the revised BIOS to anybody who requests a copy.

(Note: I have done a *lot* of work on the BIOS - it is at rev 3.7 now, up
from the last ACI v3.0, and accomodates P2DOS and ZCPR3 among other things.)

Umm, how do I get UUCP if I don't have it in the first place, and I don't
even have access to a UUCP machine that I could then KERMIT the files home
with?  Also, what's ZSM (an assembler?), and what kinds of patches do I
need to make to my system to get this running?

The BIOS drive-select specification for CP/M 2.2 was not fully
documented in early Digital Research publications and may have
contributed to the bug you have found.

In general, the BIOS should determine density/sides/format of a disk
only when the BIOS select-disk routine is called with a "new mount"
parameter (E register bit 0 value of 0).  I believe the correct "fix"
is the following: The relevant parameters should then be stored in a
data structure for that logical drive and those values used until the
drive is again selected with a new mount indication.  From your
description is sounds as if the BIOS is going through the code to
physically determine the format *each time* the drive is selected and
is not the current drive.

The BDOS keeps track of whether a drive has been logged in.  On the
first use of a drive that is not yet logged in, it sets E bit 0 to 0.
Thereafter, E bit 0 is 1, until the drive is "logged out", by a
function 13 or 37.

In your example, suppose you have just warmbooted, so that A: is the
current drive, and assume the application is searching B: *with an
explicit drive indicator in the fcb*.  The BDOS will select drive B:
as a new mount as part of the search-first function, read the first
directory sector to the directory buffer, and then re-select A: before
returning to the application.  Each search-next function will select
B: with an old mount parameter, return the sector containing the next
directory entry (reading the disk if necessary) to the directory
buffer, and then reselect A:.

If instead of an explicit drive value in the fcb, the application
first uses a BDOS drive select function to log in B:, the BDOS will
leave drive B: selected on each search first/next call.  Since the
selected drive is not changing between search calls, the Alspa BIOS
won't be attempting to determine format and presumably "Alspa's D.COM"
will return the correct directory sectors.

Bill also remarks:

>(Note: I have done a *lot* of work on the BIOS - it is at rev 3.7 now, up 
>from the last ACI v3.0, and accomodates P2DOS and ZCPR3 among other things.)

NZCOM -- the most recent version 3.4 of the ZCPR system, installs
automatically and requires no additions or modifications to a standard
BIOS.  It has many, many advantages over earlier versions, including
allowing the user to switch dynamically to a "tiny" version that
requires only 0.25 K.

ZSDOS is a replacement for the Digital Research BDOS that is distantly
descended from P2DOS.  It integrates DateStamping, public filetypes,
internal search path, fast fixed-disk relogging, and a host of other
excellent features.

NZCOM and ZSDOS run on standard Z80 CP/M 2.2 systems of all types,
require no assembly or BIOS modifications, and come with menu-driven
installation and configuration tools.  They should be fully compatible
with a corrected version of the Alspa BIOS.

The server's address is rna@lakart.uucp - for routes into lakart see my
.sig file below. The generic form for a request is:

/send whatever to wherever

the '/send' and 'to' must be present, and in the places shown, and with
no other words added in. The server uses an awk script to pull request
lines out, and the format has got to be an exact match so saying

/send index

won't get anything, since the 'to' and the address are missing.

whatever is the file you want, I'd suggest starting with help and index.
wherever is your address, and you should note the following:

1. Internet addresses can be handled as is, so if Bill Robison wanted help
he'd say:

/send help to wtr@ceres.physics.uiowa.edu

Note that lakart will route automatically to BITNET, so if you're at a
bitnet site:

/send index to fred@system.bitnet

is all it takes.

2. UUCP addresses for sites in the map can be given as:

site!user or user@site.uucp

so if I wanted to send stuff to pallio (my CP/M machine at home) I could
say:

/send index to pallio!dg
/send help to dg@pallio.uucp

3. UUCP addresses for sites _NOT_ in the map must be given as a bang path
from a backbone / other site that _IS_ in the maps, so if pallio talked to
doofus, but doofus wasn't in the maps I'd have to say:

/send index to pallio!doofus!john_doe

Any questions drop me a line here.

BTW, I "audit" all requests, and try to sort out bad ones (i.e. ones that
the server can't grok). By far and away the worst "offence" is people who
say:

/send help

without an address. That address is important!!

ZSM V2.3 _IS_ the "current" version of ZSM. It's been stable and frozen

if you've got a V2.3 (available from SIMTEL20 or rna@lakart.uucp)
you're about as up to date as it's possible to be.

For the gentleman at the University of Hawaii who wanted my address,

Subject: Plu*Perfect Systems and TurboROM

Bill Swan asked: "Be that as it may - the Kaypro in question is vanilla, so
where can I get a 'TurboROM' or 'KROM', and how much is *that*?  Also, do
you have an address for Plu*Perfect?"

First for the address of Plu*Perfect:

	Plu*Perfect Systems
	410 23rd Street
	Santa Monica, CA 90402
	213-393-6105 (evenings)

The TurboROM, developed by Plu*Perfect, is available from Advent at the
following address:

	Advent Products
	3154-F LaPalma Avenue
	Anaheim, CA 92806
	714-630-0446

Advent specializes in Kaypro computer add-ons of various sorts.  I believe
that the TurboROM costs about $60 and, from what I have heard from owners,
it is well worth the price: much faster and more flexible disk operations
and other improvements in the operation of the computer.

I am less sure of the K-ROM.  I believe that is the modified Kaypro ROM
offered by the publishers of MicroCornucopia magazine.  My feeling is that
the TurboROM offers a wider range of features and support.  For example,
Plu*Perfect sells a program called Multicopy that is like Uniform and allows
the TurboROM-equipped Kaypro to handle many CP/M disk formats as native
formats and to work with amazing speed.

Bridger Mitchell, the principal of Plu*Perfect, is a regular reader and
contributor to this newsgroup, but the current rules prohibit him from
promoting his own products.  I'm sure he will be happy to answer any
technical questions, however.

I need some help from someone out there with a Philips P2000c computer.
I bought it new 3 years ago, and I've got a couple of difficulties.
 
First, I've got some power supply problems.  The system refuses totart with h
the power supply connector attached.  If I unhook the lines from the power 
supply to the computer (inside the case), it will start up OK after the power
supply is 'warmed up'.  Anyone got any ideas or a source for parts, schematics,
etc?
 
Second, I've never been able to get anything from the serial communications
port.  I can use the printer port, but the comm port doesn't seem to do
anything.  Does anyone know the pinouts, voltage levels, Z80 portsm etc. that
I need to use the port?

My mnachine also has a 8086 CoPower board with 512k of memory.  Does any one k




Sorry about the format of this article.  I'm sending it from a BBS at the U of
Arkansas, and we just got the ability to post articles.  There's no info any
where for us about using the editor!

Does anyone know what the latest version of the Terminal ROM and Preliminary 
bootstrap for MS-DOS on this machine is?  And if there has been an upgrade
since I bought mine, where can I get it?
 
Thanks in advance.

Subject: Sanyo MBC-3000 Help Needed

   My brother's Sanyo MBC-3000 (8" drives) system just failed again,
and it does not seem to be worthwhile to spend another couple of
hundred dollars to get the boards replaced.  Debugging is impossible
with that machine because of the asynchronous, dual-processor
architecture.  Besides, the performance was terrible because of the
way that architecture was implemented.

   The problem is that some important data is stored on double-sided,
double-density diskettes in the unknown Sanyo format.  I tried reading
them with an ATR-8000, which is pretty good at identifying and
accepting various 8" formats, but it refuses to read them.  Does
anyone out there have (or know of someone who has) an MBC-3000?  In
return for help in converting the data on the diskettes to IBM SSSD
standard format I would be willing to send them some of the hardware
(such as the PC board or boards) to keep as spares for when their
machine dies.

   I would also entertain any offers for the purchase of this hardware
(in case someone wants a couple of 8" DSDD disk drives, a good power
supply, a monitor, etc.).  If you want to make an offer, you had best
be in the greater Boston area.  What the MBC-3000 lacks in software,
it makes up in hardware.  It is a beautifully put-together machine
that used plenty of metal.  In short, it weighs a ton!  I would not
even attempt to ship it.

Subject: Televideo 802

   Can anyone tell me how to configure the serial ports (and other
hardware features) of the Televideo 802 computer.  I acquired one
second hand, but the owner had lost the manual and, I believe, the
diskette containing hardware-specific utilities.  I have only the
Digital Research CP/M diskette and diskettes with some application
programs (WordStar, The Word Plus, and so on).  The most immediate
problem is getting a serial printer working.

   From somewhere I had gotten a program called TVSET.  I don't know
if it works on my Televideo 803, but it does work nicely on the 802
and looks as though that is the machine it was intended for (it can
define a string for the 25th line of the display -- which the 802 has
but of which there is no sign on the 803).  If someone has any other
utilities that came with the machine, I would appreciate it if I could
get a copy.

The original version of Citadel runs on a Kaypro.  It supports something like
32 or 64 "rooms"; each room has a message system.  There is also a central mail
facility.  A room may have a directory and have file up/downloads.  I believe
that the last version that operated under CP/M that I know about was 2.15.

It was available from the C User's Group (they advertise in programming
oriented mags).  It's also on my system in the UNaXcess BBS at 814 337 3159
(TB+) or 814 337 0348 (1200/2400).

Here's the scenario...  Dusting out my closet, I have come across a pair of
North Star Advantages. One works fine, the other has a dead screen (tube is ok,
it might be the flyback) but, the CP/M system master disk is dead. I'd like to
get at least one of these things working again so here is the question... Does
anyone have a copy of the original North Star GCP/M that they would be willing
to part with for a reasonable price? Please?

Now for the other stuff... Is there a way to make these things work with soft
sectored disks? Hard sectored disks are getting hard to come by these days.

Any help would be appreciated.

I, too would like to hear about hooking up DRAMS to a Z280.
I currently have one using 128K of static RAM (32Kx8 chips)
in 16-bit z280 mode, with burst mode working on a 5-HHz bus.
I would like to go to a 10-MHz bus, but I would need to use
static-column DRAMs (256Kx4 parts) to get enough speed.

This system currently runs CP/M 3 with a 20 meg SCSI hard disk very well.

If you are thinking of building a Z280 system, get in touch
with me, and I can relate my experiences (and circuit diagrams, etc.)

 In regards to 8 bit citadels:
 versions of the 2.10 series tend to be unstable and buggy.
 The people who first distributed the code (CRT & BAK) created an
improved version caller 2.20.  Things being things, the 2.10 seems to
be the version that got distributed far and wide.
 If you are actually going to try to put a Citadle online, mail me and
I'll be glad to mail you back 220 source code, which has the following

 I used MEX with MP/M on an Altos 580 for quite some time, and found:
 Mex worked fine up to about 1200 baud, then gave up and lost characters.
 Sometimes, particularly after using x-modem, a "phase of the moon"
 type error caused mex to lock up that user when exiting to system.
 Sometimes the problem could be solved by killing the process from another
 terminals, and sometimes it was necessary to re-boot the machine.  I
 suspect this resulted from mex writing into the common memory above
 C000.

Subject: QTERM and C128

In the last "Livewire" magazine from GEnie, they mention QTERM as being
available.  They also mention there is a C-128 overlay.  I have downloaded
QTERM (from SIMTEL), but can't find the C-128 overlay.  If anyone has one,
it would be nice to get it up on GEnie and SIMTEL.
Please let me know if it is available ( I have looked on GEnie and
SIMTEL, and also have a Compuserve account), before I waste time 
reinventing the wheel!!

Much Thanks in advance - QTERM sounds great (using MEX now).

   We need to run the Microsoft MBASIC compiler BASCOM.  I have the
program (I am still looking for LINK, but I think the SLR linker will
do), but I cannot locate a manual and do not know the syntax to use.
Can anyone help with a quick rundown on the syntax and/or a reference to
a published book or article on the subject.  Thanks.

   This need, by the way, arose in my capacity as a Boston Computer
Society trouble-shooter.  Someone's accounting package, written in
Microsoft BASIC, suddenly stopped working properly.  The user has the
source code and, upon examining it, discovered an error in some date
processing steps.  Everything was fine until this month.  He thinks he
has the fix but must now recompile the code.

Subject: Interrups and CP/M on Apple ][

I have a "CP/M Card" made by Advanced Logic Systems installed slot 4 in my
Apple ][ Plus, and a Super Serial Card installed in slot 2.  I'd like to run
a telecommunication program under DOS or ProDOS with the SSC's interrupts
enabled, but find that turning on interrupts prevents CP/M from booting.
My guess is that the SSC is generating an inturrupt either when reset or when
CP/M initializes it somehow.  Does anyone know of a way to make the two
coexist, short of soldering on a toggle switch in parallel with the DIP
switch (for my particular system, it's too much of a pain to unstack all the
stuff that lives on top of the Apple, open it, take the card out, flip the
switch, and reassemble).

I do not have any source code for the CP/M BIOS or bootup code.

Many thanks in advance for the help.

Subject: NOVADOS bug report

There is a serious bug in Novados release H (and possibly earlier
releases as well) that crops up when the number of entries used in your
disk's directory becomes a multiple of 256. Symptoms include: all files
disappearing that are after then first 256 entries, being able to open
files that disappear when you try to close them, and two copies of a
file showing up in the directory, one with 0 blocks used. To make
matters worse, when the NovaDOS fast boot option was used, the problem
would vanish if the directory had fewer then 256 entries used when it
was initally logged in at startup. You could add files to your heart's
content until you crossed the 512 entry boundary, when half of your
files would promptly vanish. The incorrect code, taken from NVDS-2.Z80,
is shown below:
 
;
; NOVADOS CODE -- INCORRECT -- Set last file
;
setlf:  call    tstlf                   ; Test last file
        ret     c                       ; No then exit
        inc     de                      ; Increment last file
        ld      (hl),e                  ; << Save it in temp0
        inc     hl                      ; << -- argh! temp0+1
        ld      (hl),d                  ; <<        & temp0+2 !!
        ret                             ; And exit
;
; Test last file
;
tstlf:  ld      hl,(temp0)              ; Get pointer to last file 
        ld      de,(filcnt)             ; Get file counter
        ld      a,e                     ; Subtract de-(hl)
        sub     (hl)
        inc     hl                      ; <<-- now (hl) points to
        ld      a,d                      ;      to temp0+1 !!
        sbc     a,(hl)
        ret                             ; Exit
 
The correction is simple; store the hi byte first, decrement the
pointer, and store the low byte. The correct code is shown below (this
fragment was extracted from Z80DDISK.ZZ0, release 24).
 
;
; Z80DOS CODE -- CORRECT -- Set last file
;
setlf:  call    tstlf                   ; Test last file
        ret     C                       ; No then exit
        inc     de                      ; Increment last file
        ld      (hl),d                  ; Save it in temp0
        dec     hl
        ld      (hl),e
        ret                             ; Andd exit
;
; Test last file
;
tstlf:  ld      hl,(temp0)              ; Get pointer to last file
        ld      de,(filcnt)             ; Get file counter
        ld      a,e                     ; Subtract filcnt-(temp0)
        sub     (hl)
        inc     hl
        ld      a,d
        sbc     a,(hl)                  ; Carry means (temp0) > filcnt
        ret                             ; Exit
 
I went back to the old SUPRBDOS code to see if this bug could have
manifested itself in other derivates, including (shudder) ZRDOS, ZSDOS
or ZDDOS. The SUPRBDOS code was correct; so this appears to be a bug
localized to NOVADOS.
 
This has been driving me <<nuts>> for about a month now. Since I've
made extensive mods to NovaDOS to support some Z80DOS style
datestamping features (notably get/use file datestamps), I wasn't sure
if the problem was in NovaDOS itself, or my mods. Now I am! I found
it by painstakingly tracing through the reset disk, select disk BDOS
call sequence and narrowing down which piece of code was going awry.

Subject: 1581 Max-81 Format

There is a slight error in the 1581 MAX-81 format as published my Miklos
Gramskezky (in Transactor and in Twin Cities 128)

The error is in the DPH block (byte 20) of the drive table.  Basically 
what it involves is having the drive seeking track 80 in a (0-79 track 
system).  The fix is to change byte 20 from 90 to 8c this will restrict 
the drive to going from 0-79 and not access physical track 81 (which 
does not exist).

I found this and it was driving me nuts after I overfilled disks and had
to remove the disk from the drive or do a warmstart (^C) in order to 
read from that drive again.  You will loose 6K when you do a show 
command but that 6k wasn't really there anyways.
I sort of figured this when some disk utilities were showing 81 tracks @
1024 bytes per sector and I knew it should only read 80 tracks.. 
SHOW [DRIVE] didn't show this (and now reports 79 tracks) but 0-79 is 80
tracks in my thinking... Any further info needed

The memory that I have of Z80MU is that it runs on an 8088 and has
a ADM-3 "hard wired" in...

Is there a version that runs on a V20?  I would think that it would run
a _lot_ faster - my recolection is that Z80MU ran at about 1-1.3 mhz
(equivalent).  Also, is there any way it can be modified for a ANSI
terminal?  And talk to PRN: as if it was LST: ?  (I assume that COM1:
access  or being to "assign" C: to go to C:\CPMSTUF1 and D: to C:\CPMSTUF2
would be too much...)

My memories of Z80MU are at least 2 years old, and I only had a chance to
play with it for 20 minutes or so.  If a newer version is avialable, with
added features, please forgive...

rna server here at lakart.

/send index to <insert your address here>

will get the index of what's there, if contained in mail addressed to
rna@lakart.UUCP. If you just want to get the files, you'll need uucp
and zsm for sure, and qtpatch may help with patching for your system.

Although this is available at lakart, please direct any related mail

Subject: Alspa Computer ACI-1/2 users only - BIOS bug

(Has the Alspa mailing list actually expired? I got no answer...)

While checking out Dave Goodenough's CP/M UUCP, I uncovered a bug in the
Alspa ACI-1&2 BIOS that apparently goes all the way back to the early
Alspaugh Engineering days (i.e., it's not *my* fault :-).

As I have been afflicted with various symptoms of this bug over the years,
usually chalking it up to the particular applications I was running, I
figure it worthwhile to share with other Alspa users on the net (and off,
but I know only one in that category).


The symptom, in general, is that an application running from one drive
fails to find all the files on another drive specified by a wildcard. I
have seen this with the above UUCP, with SHAR.COM, and a CP/M make. For
some reason I have not seen this with Alspa's D.COM.


The problem is caused by the BIOS density (disk format) routines use of
the 128-byte scratch directory buffer (DIRBF) as a scratch buffer for
reading track 0, sector 1, to determine the disk format encoded therein
at byte 7FH.

This causes the directory buffer to be clobbered between search-first and
search-next BDOS calls, and any matching but unfound file entries in the
buffer at that time will not be found.


Two fixes are possible. The first is to create a separate 128-byte buffer
for the "density" routines, so that only the BDOS uses DIRBF. The second
is a re-write of the density routines such that it is not necessary to
actually read the data into memory. (The Alspa BIOS is so tight that I
preferred the second.) Rather than list that change here, I will e-mail
the revised BIOS to anybody who requests a copy.

(Note: I have done a *lot* of work on the BIOS - it is at rev 3.7 now, up
from the last ACI v3.0, and accomodates P2DOS and ZCPR3 among other things.)

Hi All.

I have a Kaypro II, old (1983) model.  I'm after some info on the beast, 
particuarly regarding access to hardware registers.  Anyone have this 
info on hand, or know of a good source?  

Also, the SBASIC manual was parted from the machine when I got it 
(everything else seemed to be there, ie MBASIC [yuck!], the Perfect suite 
etc) - anyone know of a source of SBASIC docs?

Well, there was a bit of chat about it a while ago: getting UUCP up
and going under CP/M. After much testing by myself and my beta
testers [1], I am reasonably sure there isn't too much wrong with
V2.0h. I have therefore released it, you can get copies from the
rna server here at lakart.
 
/send index to <insert your address here>
 
will get the index of what's there, if contained in mail addressed to
rna@lakart.UUCP. If you just want to get the files, you'll need uucp
and zsm for sure, and qtpatch may help with patching for your system.
 
Although this is available at lakart, please direct any related mail
to the addresses below, since that is my CP/M machine at home.

Umm, how do I get UUCP if I don't have it in the first place, and I don't
even have access to a UUCP machine that I could then KERMIT the files home
with?  Also, what's ZSM (an assembler?), and what kinds of patches do I
need to make to my system to get this running?

The BIOS drive-select specification for CP/M 2.2 was not fully
documented in early Digital Research publications and may have
contributed to the bug you have found.

In general, the BIOS should determine density/sides/format of a disk
only when the BIOS select-disk routine is called with a "new mount"
parameter (E register bit 0 value of 0).  I believe the correct "fix"
is the following: The relevant parameters should then be stored in a
data structure for that logical drive and those values used until the
drive is again selected with a new mount indication.  From your
description is sounds as if the BIOS is going through the code to
physically determine the format *each time* the drive is selected and
is not the current drive.

The BDOS keeps track of whether a drive has been logged in.  On the
first use of a drive that is not yet logged in, it sets E bit 0 to 0.
Thereafter, E bit 0 is 1, until the drive is "logged out", by a
function 13 or 37.

In your example, suppose you have just warmbooted, so that A: is the
current drive, and assume the application is searching B: *with an
explicit drive indicator in the fcb*.  The BDOS will select drive B:
as a new mount as part of the search-first function, read the first
directory sector to the directory buffer, and then re-select A: before
returning to the application.  Each search-next function will select
B: with an old mount parameter, return the sector containing the next
directory entry (reading the disk if necessary) to the directory
buffer, and then reselect A:.

If instead of an explicit drive value in the fcb, the application
first uses a BDOS drive select function to log in B:, the BDOS will
leave drive B: selected on each search first/next call.  Since the
selected drive is not changing between search calls, the Alspa BIOS
won't be attempting to determine format and presumably "Alspa's D.COM"
will return the correct directory sectors.

Bill also remarks:

>(Note: I have done a *lot* of work on the BIOS - it is at rev 3.7 now, up 
>from the last ACI v3.0, and accomodates P2DOS and ZCPR3 among other things.)

NZCOM -- the most recent version 3.4 of the ZCPR system, installs
automatically and requires no additions or modifications to a standard
BIOS.  It has many, many advantages over earlier versions, including
allowing the user to switch dynamically to a "tiny" version that
requires only 0.25 K.

ZSDOS is a replacement for the Digital Research BDOS that is distantly
descended from P2DOS.  It integrates DateStamping, public filetypes,
internal search path, fast fixed-disk relogging, and a host of other
excellent features.

NZCOM and ZSDOS run on standard Z80 CP/M 2.2 systems of all types,
require no assembly or BIOS modifications, and come with menu-driven
installation and configuration tools.  They should be fully compatible
with a corrected version of the Alspa BIOS.

I have an Eagle IIe gathering dust in the garage.  Anyone want it?
It came with Eagle's word processor and spreadsheet programs, and I've

If I can't get rid of it, it might come in handy as a terminal if I
could find a communications/emulation program.  Anyone know of one?

Hi,

I just obtained a DIGILOG S-1000 CPM system.

I would like to use this system as a vt100 terminal emulator.

I have KERMIT-80 for it.  But since its not a popular system, I
could only get the 'dumb' terminal emulation to work.

Can anyone help me located a VT100 emulator for this?

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks.

The server's address is rna@lakart.uucp - for routes into lakart see my
.sig file below. The generic form for a request is:

/send whatever to wherever

the '/send' and 'to' must be present, and in the places shown, and with
no other words added in. The server uses an awk script to pull request
lines out, and the format has got to be an exact match so saying

/send index

won't get anything, since the 'to' and the address are missing.

whatever is the file you want, I'd suggest starting with help and index.
wherever is your address, and you should note the following:

1. Internet addresses can be handled as is, so if Bill Robison wanted help
he'd say:

/send help to wtr@ceres.physics.uiowa.edu

Note that lakart will route automatically to BITNET, so if you're at a
bitnet site:

/send index to fred@system.bitnet

is all it takes.

2. UUCP addresses for sites in the map can be given as:

site!user or user@site.uucp

so if I wanted to send stuff to pallio (my CP/M machine at home) I could
say:

/send index to pallio!dg
/send help to dg@pallio.uucp

3. UUCP addresses for sites _NOT_ in the map must be given as a bang path
from a backbone / other site that _IS_ in the maps, so if pallio talked to
doofus, but doofus wasn't in the maps I'd have to say:

/send index to pallio!doofus!john_doe

Any questions drop me a line here.

BTW, I "audit" all requests, and try to sort out bad ones (i.e. ones that
the server can't grok). By far and away the worst "offence" is people who
say:

/send help

without an address. That address is important!!
