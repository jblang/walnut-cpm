;	     I found in a reference book [1, pp. 273-276] an article 
;	by William Woodall about an Algol68 subset compiler for CP/M 
;	computers available from the CP/M user's group.  I searched...

If you're looking for a language called ALGOL/M it is in wide
distribution on many RCP/M systems such as Royal Oak, or
available in the CP/M Roundtable on GEnie.  I'm not sure of the
current address of CPMUG, but haven't had great success with
chapters when it came to getting disks through the mail.  The
best thing is to call one of the BBSes and download it direct.

Email me direct for details.

If they don't carry them (I noticed you said you tried all over the country),
you might want to find out what kind of inputs/outputs are on that chip, and
if it's easy to swap in another chip, you might want to get an MM58274 (harder

Subject: CP/M for Cromemco C10 Computer

   As a Boston Computer Society volunteer consultant, I have again been
approached by someone who inherited an old 8-bit computer without its
operating system.  The machine is a Cromemco C10 with a pair of 5.25"
disk drives.  The new owner does have a copy of the CDOS operating
system, but he has already had trouble getting a number of CP/M programs
to work (such as debuggers, since CDOS apparently uses RST 7, the
default interrupt for most debuggers).  If anyone out there could supply
a CP/M boot disk, we would appreciate it.  (I am assuming that Cromemco
is no longer in business and that there is no way to get official
support.  If I am wrong, please inform me.)

I have one of the Bernoulli Box (10+10) drives for the PC. It is on my
list of things to fool around with (perhaps a hard drive for my auld
CP/M box - I actually had one running on it many years ago, somebody
else marketed the design...). The controller board in this one has every
appearance of using a SCSI interface (although the unit I hooked up to
the CP/M box years ago had a SASI interface instead).

I unfortunately have no documentation on the interface command set -
the unit has a controller board for the PC (does not seem to work on an
AT, haven't tried it with a PC yet) and associated software. Still,
given a working configuration I don't see it being that difficult to
adapt to some other system - assuming the interface from that system is
not too difficult.

A friend has a chance to buy a TeleVideo TS-1603 microcomputer *very* cheaply,
but neither of us knows anything about that machine.  I suggested that someone
on the net might know (as is usually the case in any situation!)...

This machine comes with CP/M-86, but is there a version of MS-DOS for it?

If not, will it run CP/M executables intended for Z80-based machines?

What sorts of software packages are available for the TS-1603?

Thanks for any help!

Subject: WANTED: CP/M for Cromemco w/Tandon drives
Message-ID: <9502@spool.cs.wisc.edu>

WANTED:  A version of CP/M that runs on a Cromemco
         and supports Tandon 8" and 5.25" floppy drives.

I can't boot my copy of CP/M.

Long ago I bought a copy of MICAH CP/M for the Cromemco configured for
PerSci 8" drives.  My PerSci drive unit died last summer, so I
replaced it with a Tandon TM828-2.  Now I can't boot my copy of MICAH
CP/M.  (MICAH also sold CP/M configured for the Tandon, but at that time
my PerSci's were working, so I got the PerSci version.)

I've tried writing to MICAH twice and gotten no response...most likely
they've moved or aren't in business anymore.  My most recent address
for MICAH is:

        Dr. Jerome Freedman
        MICro Applications and Hardware (MICAH)
        15 Princess Street
        Sausalito, CA 94965

Questions:

1.  Does anybody out there in California know if he/they still exist?

2.  Does anyone have the Tandon version of MICAH CP/M they could send
    me?  (Yes, I'm a registered owner of MICAH CP/M, for whatever THAT's
    worth these days! :^)

3.  Is any other version of CP/M for the Cromemco available that supports
    Tandon drives?  I'm not the only orphaned Cromemco owner looking for
    CP/M.  I'll pass along any info I can find to others who would like it.

4.  If anyone has just the Tandon floppy disk driver code, I might be able
    to install it myself.  (I think the source code for the PerSci drivers
    came with MICAH CP/M, along with some way to install it.  I think I
    could substitute the Tandon driver code without too much pain.)

Thanks in advance for any help you can give me.

I recently embarked on a project to put 3-1/2" 1.44 Mbyte wafer drives in my

my dentist pliers and got the pinouts and some jumper info from Matsushita.

The gentleman at Matsushita says there are a myraid of variations and he has
never heard of the one I have.  It seems to set all its options with cute little
switches - but only six.  The man from Matsushita has not heard of this method
and he has not heard of half the options.  Something was said about unauthorized
importers and venders.  Two interesting options are:

	AT - PS2	(gag, yuck, my trash-80 may reject them)
	A - B

Any idea what these two do??

How do you terminate these little rice boxes?  I see not a hint of a termination
avenue.  I will install them and experiment and if I can't find a way then I
will build a tiny board ... but really there must be a way.

Hi,

I have recently built an interface to connect an Atari Mouse to my
SB180FX (Steve Ciarcia's Z-System).
I would like to publish the design in Steve's "Circuit Cellar Ink", but
this would only make sense if the mouse itself was separately available
in the US (I had difficulties buying one in Germany, I got mine from the
Netherlands).

So: can one buy an Atari Mouse separately from the Machine itself?

can't find it, let me know, and I'll dig up a copy for you.

Subject: CP/M clock
Message-ID: <2401@sactoh0.UUCP>

Just curious, has anyone successfully implemented the MM58174AN
real-time clock chip on their system, whether S-100 bus or not?  If
so, I would very much like to know how, as I got a large system I'm
using for spare parts.

Thanks muchly in advance.

       I have not even seen a CP/M box in over a decade, let alone use
one.  However, I know someone who has no access to this newsgroup/mailing
list that is interested in obtaining CP/M software.


       He is specifically looking for an implementation of Small C for
CP/M as well as other "good" applications.  Any information that you can
provide to me will be appreciated.  Info on various BBS systems would be
fine.  Pointers to other means of obtaining public domain stuff would also
be appreciated.


       Please reply via e-mail, I do not normally read this newsgroup/list.

Thank You,

George

Thought this might be of general interest:

One good source for C stuff on CP/M (or any other OS for that matter)
is C Users Group.  They have a pretty good PD library of C code including
Small C for CP/M.  They also publish a good monthly C mag "C Users Journal"

Their address etc.:

C Users Journal
2601 Iowa Street
Lawrence, Kansas 66047
(913) 841-1631

My only relation to the group is one of a satisfied customer.

Subject: Patch for Z80/Z280 disassembler package
Message-ID: <685@kunivv1.sci.kun.nl>

This is a patch for the Z80/Z280 disassembler package. The package was
originally posted as

> Newsgroups: comp.os.cpm
> Subject: Z80/Z280 disassembler in C
> Summary: Here it is
> Keywords: Z80 Z280 disassembler C
> Message-ID: <598@kunivv1.sci.kun.nl>
> Date: 27 Dec 89 12:36:54 GMT

This patch corrects the following:

        * It fixes a portability bug (NULL was mistakenly used as 0)

        * It corrects a Z280 disassembler bug ([DD|FD] ED 06/16/26/36 was
          interchanged with [DD|FD] ED 0E/1E/2E/3E)

        * It changes outhex.c to always output leading zero's on byte
          and word values that sometimes need it. This takes care of
          annoying things like

                LD      HL,(9F00H)
                LD      DE,(0A001H)

	* It includes some cosmetic changes that caused problems with
	  ancient compilers that accept the =op form (it was already
	  marked obsolete by K&R 1. sigh). Thanks to Dru Nelson
	  <dnelson@mthvax.cs.miami.edu> for pointing this out to me.

I recently sent for a log file of the messages of this list.  TINY.
So rather than sending for a second log file for an answer to my

In the log file that I got there was talk of SUPERBRAIN.  What is it ?

Second question.  Since I'm very new to cp/m and you guys out there
seem to know TONS of info about cp/m, I figured that you should know
about the value of my cp/m+onn o

Many years ago my parents got me a commodore 128 computer, it has a
z80 microprocessor and I've used it for little or nothing.  Mostly
because I haved no programs that can do anything or that are any
fun.    Is there anything out there ???
        Is there anyone out there ???

Subject: CP/M Clock
Message-ID: <2728@lll-lcc.UUCP>

There are plans in the Jul/Aug 1981 Microsystems Journal (p. 64) for a S-100
clock based on the MSM5832 chip.  It uses an 8255 PPI chip for the clock
port.  Those of you with eleven bits of unused parallel port could probably
rig up the clock chip on that with a minimum of parts count.  I just got done
wire wrapping the complete circuit for my S-100 system, and it works fine.
Unfortunately the software published in the article got munged, so if
anyone is interested, I can provide listings of what I came up with.  I've
got two clock-read entry points in ROMed code.  One reads the clock and
returns to the monitor (a monitor "date" command is next!), the other does
a ret just like any other subroutine, so it can be called from an application.
When CP/M boots, it prints the date and date at the top of the screen, and I
put the day and date on printed listings.  I just wish that there was an
easy way to timestamp files in CP/M 2.2 @:^).

If your system has a Z80 CPU, you may want to try a Kenmore Z-Time clock.
It's a piggyback board which plugs into the CPU socket of your machine
and then you plug your CPU chip into the clock board. It looks very
easy to "talk to", although I'm still having a tough time trying to
cram one into my Altos 580. (The motherboard is below the hard disk
and controller, and there's very little clearance. Then, of course, the
40-pin DIP headers I bought to build an extender cable hang too far over
the edges of the socket, and interfere with other chips...)

I don't have their address handy, but the Z-Time clock is made by an
outfit in Rochester, NY. It shouldn't be too tough to find one.

This was true - the set I connected to my Alspa CP/M box long about '82
were SASI drives, but the PROMs in the set I have now are explicitly
labelled "SCSI". None of which is very helpful to Mr.Bergman who asked
the original question...

Subject: NEC V20 / CPM

As far as I know the NEC V20 processor has the capability to
execute Z80 (or 8080 ?) opcodes. Is there some program that supports
these capabilities and e.g. realizes a CP/M environment on a MSDOS
machine ? I know this application might sound quite weird, but I need
it because my CP/M system has no harddisk at the moment.
The last problem could be solved if some can supply information on
a cheap ECB bus (well known in Europe) compatible harddisk controller.

Thanks for any information,

Does anybody have dox for an S-100 Cromemco 8PIO, or know anything about one?
 
I have a bunch of questions about the board.  I bought it for scrap, and of
course there was no documentation with it at all.

1.  S1 & S2 are 8 position dip switches. The leftmost 5 bits of S2 set the MSB
    of the card address (A3->A7), and then the 25-pin headers (H0->H7) are the
    8 parallel ports counting up from the base address.  What are the rightmost
    3 positions of this switch used for??  They are marked D0->D2.
2.  The x's represent 8 LEDs that seem to be controlled by the 8 bits of S1,
    and seem to appear on port7.  Surely there must be more??  What am I
    missing??
3.  Each 25-pin header (Hkl) has the following pin-out:
           ? 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 ? ? ? *   <---port l
           ? ? ? 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 ? ?   <---port k
    where pin * is cut off.  I can find the bit positions (as shown), and the
    ?'s are probably handshakes, etc.  But which are what?  R1 and R2 are
    relays, and R1 audibly latches on pins 0 and 1 of port 1.  What are they
    used for and how?
4.  To the left of the relays there are jumper positions marked:  NC, Jn-24,
    Jn-23, and PIC, where n is 4 for R1 and 3 for R2.  What are these for?
    Jn-23 and Jn-24 are connected to pins 23 and 24 of H01 and H23.  Do bits
    0 and 1 of ports 1 and 3 supply AC or DC to pins 23 and 24 of the header?
    
The relays are marked: "*SIGMA (* is a backward RU)
                        60RE1S-5DC
                        1A,28VDC
                        .5A,120VAC"
The board has an optoisolator on it MCT66, and one other jumper (factory
installed??) labeled "Port 6 out".  It is: REV. E1, MOD LEVEL 1.
 
The card is in really good shape, and is quite usable, as long as I can get
some help on these questions.  I will appreciate any clues.

 I encountered a serious problem with Turbo-Modula 2 Version 1.0
for Z80. When using the TM2-environment heavily, editing, compiling
etc., it happens that existing files not concerned with M2 will be
overwritten. Damage is reported by CLEANDIR, error message is:
'two files share the same block.' or so.
On my 20 Meg hard drive, TM2 is installed on user area 3. The affected files
mostly, if not always,  reside on user 0 to 2.
Im am running ZCPR33 and NOVADOSH. I never had such problems with
any other software. Could it be the TM2 'RENAME' Routine?
How could it be fixed?

	AT - PS2 probably governs the operation of the Diskette Changed/Drive
	Ready line. ATs need diskette changed, and I had assumed that PS/2s
	did also.

	It is also possible that this controls drive selects in conjunction

	These buggers usually have high-resistance terminators (abt 3k)
	in them that are hard wired on. Since the terminators are high
	resistance, it doesn't really hurt to have two terminated
	drives in the system.

Subject: NEED info on Morrow Designs S100 CP/M machine
Message-ID: <9001130509.AA10248@rice-chex>

Hello *

In front of me is a Morrow Designs CP/M S100 machine.  It has a hard
drive, a floppy (8"), and some boards in the card cage.  The boards are:

	* MPZ80 Processor board.  Everything is here.. EPROM is
	  labelled "MON 4.45".  There is a DIP switch on the card, 8
	  positions.  There is one empty socket; looks like room for
	  another EPROM.

	* DJDMA Floppy controller board.

	* MM65K16S 64K memory card.  Loaded with 32 6116 2K x 8 static
	  RAM chips.  Two sets of DIP switches, lots of headers with
	  push-on shorting blocks.  There is one empty 20-pin socket.
	  (My guess is that the board would do 16-bit transfers if the
	   host processor could handle it.)

	* An HDCA-4A Winchester Controller.  It's wired to an 8" 20
	  MByte hard drive.

	* Lastly, a Multi-IO Interface board.  Three 8250's, an 8259
	  PIA, room for two EPROMS, and what looks like a real-time
	  clock.

For those that have some experience in dealing with Morrow hardware, a
question: Turning the box ON and pressing RESET causes the hard drive
to move it's heads a bit.. and then a message is displayed: DFBA4

I then see a ":" prompt.  In tinkering around, I can display memory.

The previous owner said he had never seen anything like this; his
experience was that the machine had always booted up, displaying an A>
prompt.

Sigh.  No books, no manuals, nothing.  The machine was to serve a
useful purpose; with YOUR help it may still serve.

If YOU (the reader) have ANY info on these boards, switch settings,
whatever, please get in touch with me.  Pointers to hardcopy on the
manuals would be very much appreciated.

Save bandwidth - use e-mail.  I will reply.  If sufficient interest, I
will summarize to the group.

Regards,
Mark

Message-ID: <9526@spool.cs.wisc.edu>

The GOOD news:

Thanks for the many replies to my request for a Cromemco S-100 TUART
(dual serial port) board.  If anyone else needs one, email me and I'll
point you to some people who can supply one.  Prices varied from "swap
ya for something" to "free, if you pay postage" to about $30.

The BAD news:

I've gotten ZERO response to my questions about the availability of a CP/M
that runs on a Cromemco and boots from 8" and 5.25" Tandon floppies.

I still don't know if MICAH (a former supplier) is still in business in
Sausalito, CA.  (Can somebody out there in CA check?  Sausalito is still
there, isn't it? :^)  My most recent address for MICAH is:

   Dr. Jerome Freedman
   MICro Applications & Hardware
   15 Princess Street
   Sausalito, CA 94965.

If anyone has Tandon floppy-driver source code (8080/Z80), I might be able
to make-do with that.

Some other people have also expressed an interest in a version of CP/M for
the Cromemco if I can track one down.  Thanks in advance for any leads you
can provide!

Subject: CompuPro documentation sought
Message-ID: <1160@crash.cts.com>

Hello all.

I need to find documentation for the following S-100 boards.  I know how
to set up a couple of them, but with no manuals, I'm still pretty much
in the dark.

The boards are:

	1) CompuPro Disk 3
	2)   "  "   Disk 1A
	3)   "  "   Interfacer 3
	4)   "  "   Interfacer 4
	5)   "  "   512k MDrive-H
	6)   "  "   RAM 22
	7)   "  "   RAM 23
	8)   "  "   CPU 286

I have the RAM 22 and the MDrive-H in my box right now, and they work ok.
The CompuPro CP/M 8-16 manual has setup information for most of the rest
of these, but it's just switch settings.  No mention of what the switches
DO.  Or what all the shunts do, which for something like the Interfacer
3/4, is asking for trouble.  I mean, how would you like to have to
configure something as complicated as a System Support 1 ( which I DO
have a manual for, BTW ) without the manual?

Any information would be much appreciated.

Subject: NEED info on Morrow Designs S100 CP/M machine
Message-ID: <9001130509.AA10248@rice-chex>

Hello *

In front of me is a Morrow Designs CP/M S100 machine.  It has a hard
drive, a floppy (8"), and some boards in the card cage.  The boards are:

	* MPZ80 Processor board.  Everything is here.. EPROM is
	  labelled "MON 4.45".  There is a DIP switch on the card, 8
	  positions.  There is one empty socket; looks like room for
	  another EPROM.

	* DJDMA Floppy controller board.

	* MM65K16S 64K memory card.  Loaded with 32 6116 2K x 8 static
	  RAM chips.  Two sets of DIP switches, lots of headers with
	  push-on shorting blocks.  There is one empty 20-pin socket.
	  (My guess is that the board would do 16-bit transfers if the
	   host processor could handle it.)

	* An HDCA-4A Winchester Controller.  It's wired to an 8" 20
	  MByte hard drive.

	* Lastly, a Multi-IO Interface board.  Three 8250's, an 8259
	  PIA, room for two EPROMS, and what looks like a real-time
	  clock.

For those that have some experience in dealing with Morrow hardware, a
question: Turning the box ON and pressing RESET causes the hard drive
to move it's heads a bit.. and then a message is displayed: DFBA4

I then see a ":" prompt.  In tinkering around, I can display memory.

The previous owner said he had never seen anything like this; his
experience was that the machine had always booted up, displaying an A>
prompt.

Sigh.  No books, no manuals, nothing.  The machine was to serve a
useful purpose; with YOUR help it may still serve.

If YOU (the reader) have ANY info on these boards, switch settings,
whatever, please get in touch with me.  Pointers to hardcopy on the
manuals would be very much appreciated.

Save bandwidth - use e-mail.  I will reply.  If sufficient interest, I
will summarize to the group.

Regards,
Mark

Subject: TUART & CP/M:  good news, bad news
Message-ID: <9526@spool.cs.wisc.edu>

The GOOD news:

Thanks for the many replies to my request for a Cromemco S-100 TUART
(dual serial port) board.  If anyone else needs one, email me and I'll
point you to some people who can supply one.  Prices varied from "swap
ya for something" to "free, if you pay postage" to about $30.

The BAD news:

I've gotten ZERO response to my questions about the availability of a CP/M
that runs on a Cromemco and boots from 8" and 5.25" Tandon floppies.

I still don't know if MICAH (a former supplier) is still in business in
Sausalito, CA.  (Can somebody out there in CA check?  Sausalito is still
there, isn't it? :^)  My most recent address for MICAH is:

   Dr. Jerome Freedman
   MICro Applications & Hardware
   15 Princess Street
   Sausalito, CA 94965.

If anyone has Tandon floppy-driver source code (8080/Z80), I might be able
to make-do with that.

Some other people have also expressed an interest in a version of CP/M for
the Cromemco if I can track one down.  Thanks in advance for any leads you
can provide!

The Intertec Superbrain is a CP/M machine, can't remember too much about
them (I used them a bit while at college back in 1981 and 1982). Main things
that spring to mind is that it's a VT52 emulating terminal, uses a 1791
disk controller which has a nasty habit of inverting data written to disk.
Like most CP/M machines it has it's quirks, but once you get the hang of how
to work around them, you'll be all set.

You need to get that C128 going in CP/M mode!! First things first, drop me
a line with your US mail address and I'll ship out a disk with some useful
(read indispensible) utilities. I'll include a communications program all
set up for the C128, and once you're talking to whatever host you use (you
do have a 1670 modem, right?) I can start E-mailing out the games and other
goodies to get the 128 to strut it's stuff. If you have a Q-link account,
look me up - I'm Delta G there, and often times stick my head round the
door of conferences and the like.
 
If you are on a BITNET host, drop a line to LISTSERV@NDSUVM1.BITNET
saying /PDDIR and HELP. That will put you in touch with the SIMTEL20
CP/M archives which are so full of good stuff it's unreal.
 
Please respond by E-mail to the addresses below, not to the addresses in

Subject: ZMP

I am aware that ZMP (a Zmodem program) exists, and I see that there are
several overlays for it.  However, I see no note on an overlay for the C-128.
First, does anyone have a C-128 overlay for ZMP.  Next, if no one has done it
yet, can anyone tell me if the ZMP overlays are like anything else in the
world.  I have done a 128 overlay for QTERM - are they in anyway similar?

	Unfortunately, you're a couple of months late. Until recently,
	Computer Shopper had an article devoted to CP/M on the 128.

	Yes, there's stuff out there. But I don't know where it is and
	what is available for the 128. I'm running software that I 
	"obtained" about 10 years ago (well... except for Turbo Pascal

A friend has acquired a Xerox 850 without documentation or (apparently)
any boot disk.  He previously had a Xerox 820 but the boot disks from it
won't work on the 850.  I suspect, without seeing either, that the 850
uses a double-density, or double-sided, disk for booting, whereas the
820 had neither.  The 850 does not have any sort of hard disk.

If anyone can assist in determining what my friend has, might be interested
in purchasing it, or can help get it running, please let me know.  The
friend does not have net access and is physically in Los Angeles.

Subject: Z-System compatible communications software

Ian Justman asked (a while ago -- sorry it has taken me so long to get
around to writing a reply):

>> Does anyone know of a Z-System compatible communications package?

I'm not quite sure what is meant by this question.  There are no comm
programs that know about named directories, and so far none is able to use
the TCAP to configure the terminal codes, though I think it would be
possible to write a MEX or IMP overlay that would read the TCAP and hot-
patch the codes into the overlay.

If what you were hoping for is a comm package that would run right out of
the box, there is no hope.  The Z-System environment does not have any
information about the modem ports, and there is no BIOS standard for
supporting them as in MS-DOS.

There is a cute tool that Bruce Morgen invented and I elaborated on to allow
MEX and MEX-Plus (which internally looks a bit like Z-System in so far as it
allows multiple commands on a line) to shell a command out to the operating
system and then return automatically to MEX where it left off.  This is
called MEX2Z or MEX+2Z and should be on Z-Nodes (and perhaps on SIMTEL20).

Hope this helps a little...

I would like to know too.  I am running ZCPR33 on my system and
thoroughly enjoying it.  I _HAD_ to run it so I could use VLU.  The
only difference is that I downloaded it from a local BBS a while
back, and don't understand how NZCOM works, nor can I presently
afford it.  So, I would like to know how that works, too, just for
the fun of it...

That matter is dealt with in the same issue of TCJ that covers the new
features in ZCPR34.

P.S.  Come on guys!  There is a great magazine out there, The Computer
Journal, that is the only one left catering to 8-bit computer hobbyists.
If you don't support it, then there will be none, and all of you will
complain about the lack of support for CP/M.  A subscription is only
$16 for a year (US, 6 issues), and Sage Microsystems East will even pay
the first $2 on new subscriptions.  Probably about 95% of all the questions
I get about Z-System have been answered in TCJ articles in columns by me,
Bridger Mitchell, and the other Z-System developers.

Subject: IBM PC kermit
Message-ID: <632605991.940000.KLENSIN@INFOODS.MIT.EDU>

Most of the IBM PCs in the world run PCDOS of some flavor.  The current 
MSDOS kermit (2.30 or 3.0) will run with PCDOS 2.1 or later if you have the 
circa 256K of memory it needs.  For smaller or older machines or versions 
of the OS, you are going to need a very early kermit.  I can paw throught 
my floppy disks if necessary and try to find you one, and let you know.

IBM CP/M-86 Kermit has never been released, due to some difficulties in 
shipping, communications problems in the USA, and the fact that it 
represents a later release and compiler (with a few new features) than the 
other CP/M-86 kermits.  Their maintainers weren't excited about putting the 
new features and structure (really intended to support a native Concurrent 
CP/M implementation) into their versions, and my collaborators and I have 
never gotten adequately motivated, despite good intentions, to retrofit the 
changes into the older version.  If you really need the thing, I can try to 
send you a version, but this raises the other problem with CP/M-86 kermit, 
and CP/M-86 generally, which is that, unlike CP/M-80, there is no standard 
HEX format and LOAD/UNLOAD programs generally available.  And, because we 
were never able to get recent versions of Concurrent to run on our 
hardware, it is difficult for us to even read and copy the diskettes
now (it means booting CP/M-86 from floppies, then operating in a floppy-
only environment).

I *do* have diskettes containing a working version of IBM PC CP/M-86 
kermit.  If you really need it, do you have suggestions for getting the 
software to you?

If you have easy access to BITNET, send the message "HELP" to
KERMSRV@CUVMA. This is the on-line repository for KERMIT, and they have
it for everything. For example, yesterday I picked up PDP-8 KERMIT for
my DECmate II. I am absolutely certain that they have CP/M-86 KERMIT,
since I have it for my Rainbow.

I've not seen Tetris for CP/M-86, but there are several DOS flavors.

Message-ID: <2343@stcns3.stc.oz.AU>

No, this is not a joke.  Has anyone ported "make" for CP/M?  It would
have to be really simple, of course.  Ignore the (non-existent) time
stamps and just re-compile (or perhaps keep a simple data-base of
time stamps based on the file-modified bit?) etc.  Ignore the rules
about yacc/lex/whatever, and heaps of other shortcuts...

For the record, my C compiler supports execl()/execv(), as well as
spawnl(), spawnv() and spawnve(), (but not fork()/system() :-).
(Please don't ask for the compiler - it's commercial, and the author
probably reads this group.  I can supply details upon request though.)

Failing an existing product, I may take a stab at doing it myself.
Although constrained by 360k floppies (albeit with 64kb RAM disk) does
tend to severely limit one...

(Hmmm...  has anyone outside of Australia heard of the Microbee
computer, in its various incarnations?  Great little machine!)

Cheers, as they say "down-under".

   You should take a look at the files containing my columns from The
Computer Journal (names like TCJ##.WZ -- and you should subscribe!).
I do not remember the issue (perhaps #38), but I covered this subject
in detail in one of them, the one in which NZCOM was first announced.
ZCPR34 is not the same as ZCPR33; it is the next revision.  The command
processor in NZCOM is the same command processor that can be installed
manually from the ZCPR34 source code, which is available to those who
insist on doing a manual installation.

   Unfortunately, after more than a year, I can no longer remember what
all the differences were.  One is that Z34 can handle type-4 programs,
those that are fully relocatable.  Type-3 programs, introduced with
Z33, load to a fixed address but one that may differ from 100H (a typical
address is 8000H).  Type-4 programs typically load as high in memory as
possible in the given configuration.  This address is automatically adjusted
for the system size and for the presence of RSXs (resident system extensions)
such as ZEX.

   With Z34 support was added for the new environment data that includes
a complete map of which drives are supported.  MAXDR (max drive) alone
can not cover cases such as drives A, B, F, and G.  Setting MAXDR to G
left the system open to getting hung up if drive C was accessed.  The new
Z3ENV also has the addresses and sizes of the CCP, DOS, and BIOS (starting
address only).  This paves the way for advanced command processors and
DOSs that are larger than those prescribed by CP/M.

   These are the main points, but my recollection is that the TCJ article
mentioned a total of four new features.

Hallo !

I found a computer called BMC OKI IF-800-20.

I think it`s a CPM machine, but i have no manual or other informations.
I have no system disk , too.
Could someone help me ?

The original IOmega boxes were SASI interfaces, but IOmega changed to SCSI
several years ago.

The SASI interface is indeed the predecessor of SCSI, but they are not 
compatible.

There are a few emulators available on Simtel20, under <msdos.emulators>.
I have the 8080 emulator and the Z80 emulator, and have had no problems yet!
They are V2080J88.arc and ZRUN321.ARC.

Yes, I did quite some years ago.  It had to jump thorough some hoops to

Why?  My "base" for my port was one posted (from Australia) for some
odd (for here) version of UNIX.  It ran under CP/M pretty much the
same as one does for UNIX.

One thing though: mine WAS for CP/M 3.0 ("CP/M Plus") with time
stamps supported.  If the CP/M 3.0 timestamp "call" were implemented
under some other CP/M (using a OS-call filter, I forget the CP/M term),
then it'd work as-is.

Mine was built using the Aztec C II compiler.  My mechanism was to build
a .BAT file with the suitable "command-lines", then chain to that file.

I had 1.2 MB floppies and 1Meg of DRAM (mostly disk cache).  The floppy size
might hurt things if your compiler is big....

I had my "make" put into the Simtel CP/M archive (probably under CPM3).
It'd be a good starting point if you can't upgrade to CP/M 3.0 nor
write something to "fake" CP/M 3.0's "standard" timestamp call.
I might have it at home as well.  The old beast is gathering dust....

Subject: Newcomer questions (emacs, C compiler, libc, books)
Message-ID: <16875@duke.cs.duke.edu>

I just recently bought a TRS-80 Model 4P. That confession doesn't come
easy; this perverse act has really estranged me from many folks around
here who aren't keen on older technology:-).

Does anybody have a teeny weenie editor that feels sorta like an EMACS
for this critter (or more generally for CP/M in general)?

What C compiler(s) are recommended for this beastie? If I can't get a
tiny emacs-style editor from someone else my next attempt is going to be
to port ELLE.

Does anybody have something like unto a PD useable subset of libc.a for
CP/M? One of those would bring the goal closer into reach, given the
availability of Small-C (which I would be willing to try and hack ELLE
into) or the possibility of back-ending gcc for the Z80 (as a
cross-compiler only, obviously).

I should remark that this is running Montezuma CP/M 2.2.

(P.S. Thanks to the folks who responded to my plea for help getting
CP/M; it turns out I found someone who lives rather near me who had what
I needed).

Also, does anybody have favorite books to recommend for (1) CP/M
architecture and systems programming, and (2) Z80 machine/assembler?

Thanks!

I need a termcap entry for the generic version of Kermit80 for CPM.
My CPM system (Digilog S-1000) is not supported fully in the
Kermit distribution.

I did, however, get the generic implementation of Kermit up and
running on it. But I can't get EMACS to work properly with this
generic version.  EMACS needs a pretty smart terminal to run (like
a VT100).  I've tried using the termcap for ADM3A, but still had
problems with KERMIT80.

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks in advance.

I've seen a lot of requests for Kermit (why?  I have no idea)  so I thought

I ordered "Turbo Toolbox" directly from Borland a few years ago.  They then
cost about $50, I think.  I don't know if they still sell them.  I used the
software to develop a simple address book program, which is still serving
me well.  We also bought the toolbox here at work and used it for a while, 
but had a lot of problems with the database files getting corrupted.

Why not try Compupro?  I've got a few of the ones you want, but copying 
them would take most of a day and you'd end up with bad copies...  You can
still buy them (as far as I know) from Compupro (well, Viasyn) and then you
get the real thing.

If I'm wrong and you  can't get them, write me and I'll see what I can do..

This depends on what kind of demands you make upon the controllers.
Here we use SCSI devices from SASI host adaptors (and vice versa) with
great success.  The SCSI bus is certainly a wild and improper superset of
SASI, but the ancestry shows through quite strongly.

Subject: MAKE for CP/M

Dave Horsfall asked about a MAKE utility for CP/M.  There is one posted on
my Z-Node (617-965-7259, password = DDT) called RCPMKE13.LBR.  Here is the
entry in the FOR file:

----
RCPMKE13.LBR - ZCPR33 Specific
   RCPMKE13 is MAKE.RCP version 1.3.  MAKE is modeled on the
   Unix MAKE.  It runs as an ZCPR33 RCP, schedules source files for
   assembly/compilation and then monitors the assembly/compilation
   process, aborting if errors are detected.  It's superior to the
   FINDERR method in that multiple-pass compilers with overlays are
   supported ( PL/I ), or any compiler that overwrites the error
   location prior to warm booting.  See MAKE.DOC

----

As you will notice, however, the above program will work only in a modern
Z-System (ZCPR33 or later).

Dave commented further:

>> No, this is not a joke.  Has anyone ported "make" for CP/M?  It would
>> have to be really simple, of course.  Ignore the (non-existent) time

   What is this about "non-existent time stamps"?  If you use DateStamper or
any of the modern DOS replacements (of which there are now quite a few:
P2DOS, Z80DOS, NOVADOS, ZSDOS/ZDDOS, etc.), those time stamps would not be
"non-existent".  And I believe that there was version of MAKE available with
DateStamper that would do just what the standard Unix MAKE does.  I have
never been interested in any of this myself and have not tried it, but you
might try dropping Bridger a line at BRIDGER @ RAND.ORG.

UniDOS, put out by the people that do Uniform, can run CP/M on a V20.
It also has a Z80 interpreter mode for ppl without a V20. But, most
excitingly, they also sell an 8 MHz Z80 coprocessor; it's very
fast, uses the DOS file structure, and runs almost all of my CP/M
stuff--even the disk sector editors!!!

I like "Mastering CP/M" by Alan R. Miller, published by SYBEX.

I've got two "regular" Model 4's, and I run Mont. Micro CP/M
exclusively.  None of this TRASHDOS stuff.  I also run a BBS on it,
with the overlays on the RAMDISK for fast loading.  Does the 4P have
the RAMDISK?  

I use BDS C as my C compiler.  It compiles and runs fast, but
doesn't support every "standard C" function.  It is very inexpensive.

You might consider looking at QTERM which has VT100 emulation.  A
friend of mine uses it locally on his TRS-80 model 4 using EMACS.
It's a pretty small, nice, and powerful program, with split screen,
practically all the flavors of Xmodem, plus it has Kermit, so it's
an ideal program to call mainframe systems.  And it has one of the
most powerful chat script languages I have ever used.  The newer
version (I'm beta testing it) has an even MORE powerful chat script
language.

Dear moderator,

Can you please add the following message to the CP/M mailing list?
Or maybe you can answer the question at once.

Thanks in advance.

Lucas Noldus (NOLDUS@RCL.WAU.NL)

===============================================

I would like to know if there is a possibility to determine the number of
free bytes on a disk from inside a BASIC program on a CP/M computer.
The type of computers I am talking about are three types of portable
computers: Epson PX-4, Epson PX-8 and Husky Hunter. Further, the type of disk
I mean is a RAM disk.

The CP/M command STAT performs this function but (1) it cannot be issued from
inside BASIC, and (2) STAT produces information on the screen that I don't
want. However, STAT must be using some kind of CP/M service call and I would
like what kind of call or machine code routine that is. The manual of the
Epson PX-8 includes a list of BIOS services, but none of those concerns disk
space. The BASIC function FRE() returns the amount of free RAM but that's not
what I want. I need the number of bytes available for file storage.

Does anybody know how to do this? Any suggestion is welcome! Thanks in
advance.

I am looking for either a communications program or free standing error

want to get this data transfered to IBM/PC format. If anyone has any sources
for this or alternative suggestions, I would appreciate it very much. Any
advise on serial transfers without error checking would also be interesting.

Message-ID: <1140014@hpsjtjb.HP.COM>

Well, back when I was hacking on ADL more actively, I took Mike's MAKE and
converted it to run under CP/M 2.2 and BDS C versio 1.50a.  It used the archive
bit as a change indicator and worked just fine.

Later I changed it a bit so that it would work under C/NIX.  I couldn't find a
reasonable way to exec C/NIX's shell so I had it write a text file which could
then be run explicitly.

Send e-mail if you'd like me to try to get source and/or executables together.

Subject: NetHack for CP/M?
Message-ID: <26209@cup.portal.com>

     Is  it  possible  (or has it already  been  done?)  to  port 
NetHack to CP/M?
     I talked to a couple of people already about this, but  have 
gotten  no straight answers... They were the kind of  people  who 
refuse to belive that CP/M is still being used today...
     Anyways,  some  good  points were brought up.  I  dont  have 
experence with it firsthand, but I was told that NetHack takes  a 
meg  of RAM. In a 64k environment, that sounds daunting, but  for 
one  thing, overlays can be used. Heck, theyre used all the  time 
(take a look at WS4 and ZMP). So, only the 'core' need be running 
in  RAM  at  one  time, while it pulls what  it  needs  from  the 
overlay(s). Of couse, a hard disk would be needed...
     Another  was the 'non-standardness' of CP/M machines. I  see 
that a port to MS-DOS exists, and MS-DOS uses quite a few of  the 
same  calls  that CP/M has (MS-DOS Int 21h for the most  part  is 
similar  to the BDOS). Things like termcap are no  problem,  ZCPR 
users  already have that figured out, and CP/M users should  know 
what  their  terminal  emulates (it seems that quite  a  few  are 
TeleVideo and Lear-Siegler (sp) compatable)
     About  the only BIG problem I can really see is things  like 
the BIOS, and that shouldnt be a problem, either. An extra header 
file can define all the needed machine dependant stuff.

     Is  it possible? Or am I looking at something thats  just  a 
pipe-dream?

Message-ID: <1614@adobe.UUCP>

Hi folks,

I've got a perfectly good DEC VT-180 sitting around that I will probably 
never use again.  (This is a VT-100 terminal with a CP/M board, essentially)
It has:
	Four 5 1/4" disk drives
	64 K
	Lots of software (with documentation :-), including:
		C compiler (Mix C)
		Turbo Pascal
		Word Processor
		dBase II
		Statistical analysis software
		Multiplan (spreadsheet)
		Basic
		...more stuff I can't think of right now

I would like to find someone with whom I can swap my CP/M boards in the
VT-180 for a set of VT-125 boards, or a VT-102 board (the former is obviously
perferred.)

So, If you have a VT-102 or VT-125 that you would be willing to swap boards
from, send me email (jeynes@adobe.com) or call me ((415) 962-4917), and we
can discuss logistics.  (I don't want to charge anything for the computer,
but it would be nice if you paid the shipping for it.)

Message-ID: <9001250914.aa17638@crdec2.apgea.army.mil>

Does anyone out there know where I can either obtain replacement floppy disk
drives (CDC 9408 DSDD drives from an Intertec Compustar VPU-30) or get the
malfunctioning disk repaired?  The Intertec drawings call out CDC 9408/9409,
and the drive itself has a Magnetic Peripherals  Part number 77680001 and 
equipment identification number BR8B1A on the plate at the rear of the drive.

I have 7 of these Intertec units using this drive at this location, and I know
I will need more disk drives in the future.  These have been running flawlessly
for approximately 9 years, and I hope to keep them in operation in the future.

Thanks for your assistance!

Recently there were some postings requesting info about or bemoaning
the lack of date stamps and make utility under CP/M 2.2.
As Jay Sage pointed out, DateStamper provides a very functional
date stamping mechanism.  Furthermore, it comes with (or perhaps this
has to be requested additionally--it's been quite a while since I got
my copy) an implementation of make that knows how to use its date
stamps.  Not the same as UNIX make, perhaps, but much better than
nothing.  Sage Microsystems East used to (still does?) sell it--
phone 617-965-3552, addr 1435 Centre St., Newton Centre, Mass.02159-2469.
I bought my copy directly from Plu*Perfect Systems, but can't locate
their addr or phone # at the moment.

I have no commercial interest in Sage Microsystems or Plu*Perfect Systems,
just another satisfied customer.

I thought I would pass this little thingie along for those wanting
to get files from SIMTEL20.  In order to get the directory, you
have to mail a request according to the helpfiles that have been
posted here from time to time.  BTW, I didn't write this file;
someone else did, a friend of mine with access to an MS-DOS machine
gave me a copy of the shell script and I modified it to suit my
needs.  As it stands, it sends files to my system.  You have to
modify it so it knows where you want your files to go, and how to
get to the list server.

Enjoy!!!!  (Or at least try...)

There is a version 5.2a available.  It however, is payware: $150.00.
To here them tell it, the folks at Computerwise Consulting were severely 
put upon by people demanding free support.  Frankly, I think that they
should have charged a nominal fee for the software and their usual fees
for consultation since they say that their problem was demands for
support.  However, I'm not they, so I don't know the whole story.

Since V3.10 suits my needs (used once in a blue moon and works fine), I 
am not currently using V5.2a.  It'n not worth that kind of money for my
needs (your milage may vary).

They don't say anything about liscensing the source, but you don't
know until you ask.  I notice that their address is unchanged but they
seem to have a new phone:

		Computerwise Consulting Services
		P.O. Box 813
		McClean, VA 22101
		(703) 450-7175

I though that 3.10 was quite excellent and I don't understand why
people had any serious problems with it.

Subject: program name under CP/M
Message-ID: <1929@gmdzi.UUCP>

Does there exist a standard way to determine the name of the current program
from within a program under CP/M PLUS?

For example, if my program is in file TEST.COM on drive b, does there exist a
CALL 5 or a specific address where I can find the string B:TEST.COM? The
FCB-Format would be acceptable, too.

And if I rename the program (without changing it), say to FOO.BAR, then I would
like to get the string B:FOO.BAR in the program.

I couldn't find a CALL 5 entry, nor do the addresses 0H - 0FFH contain that
information on my CP/M PLUS machine. :-|

But there *must* be a way to determine it, because the CCP displays the last
command (program) executed when I type Control-W. Where is the pointer to that
text?

Any ideas?

I'm not sure about CP/M PLUS but my ZCPR33/Z-System works like this ...
As the CCP loads the program the same way as any other program would
load a file, it uses an FCB.
This FCB is located not in low core (0..ff) but rather somewhere in high
core (probably even above the CCP/BDOS/BIOS).
One trick might be to write a program which scans the entire memory for
it's own name (Call it AAAAAAAA.COM, look for 8 consecutive A's but
watch out for the command line buffer).
ZCPR33 has the address of this "external FCB" stored in it's
"environment descriptor" so you can just use a library function and
voila ... You know who You are (at least Your program knows who it is).

Hello.  I have a four-year old nephew who has access to a DEC Robin
running CPM.  I don't know much about the machine, but I was wondering
if there was anyone out there who might have some games for a youngster
to play.  Shareware, public domain, even for pay.
					any help would be most appreciated.

Message-ID: <BOORTZ.90Jan29114629@athena.sics.se>

A friend of mine has got an old Sharp MZ-3500 for free and asked
me if his his 9 years old son could use it to run some public 
domain games.
  There are two different system diskettes with it. EOS, I think
it is an CP/M 2.2 clone, and FDOS.

	Does anyone have information about this machine, these
	operating systems and what operating system to use?

	Does anyone have the 22DISK (a good shareware program to
	read CP/M diskettes in a MSDOS PC) definitions for the diskette
	types (the different system disks use different formatting,
	I tried to define the EOS format but failed, (to me, a very 
	strange sector order))?

	Does anyone know of suitable games for a 9 years old
	boy to run on it?

	Does anyone know the RS-232 pinout on the PCB connector
	(there is no real connector)?

I recently bought a Zenith data systems Z100 with a 20 meg hardrive
and a turbo boost toggle switch?? for fifty bucks at a garage sell.
It's a 1986 model heath kit.

I don't know if it works, it didn't come with a manual or software.
Is this a cpm based machine? 

Do you know where I can get some startup software?

It's an MSDOS / CPM hybrid - comes with an 8080 and 8085 set of micro-
processors.  MSDOS and CPM dont CO-process; its a complete tradeoff.
From what I've heard, the MSDOS part is a kludge and not very compatible.
I wanted one of those when they came out... I hope you enjoy it!

As far as I know, Z80MU relies heavily on the similarities between
MESSDOS and CP/M to simplify the whole system.
You'll probably have to simulate MESSDOS or even CP/M to run Z80MU.

If you are running Z3PLUS (the Z-System version for CP/M 3) there is a
standard library function in the assembly-language Z3LIB package that
will return the name of the current program.  This, and the SYSLIB
package, are a great aid in applications programming.

If you are running only CP/M 3, the system saves the last command line
in a buffer in a CP/M 3 RSX.  In principle this can be located from
flags and pointers in the System Control Block; there is no system call
for that purpose, and I don't know of a canned routine to do it.
Perhaps someone else does.

The CP/M 3 archives on simtel20 include a file that has more
information about the SCB than is found in the CP/M 3 manuals.  It's
in a library (whose name I have forgotten) devoted to a z80
replacement for the stock CP/M 3 CCP.COM, developed in Canada before
Z3PLUS was available.

Not  knowing what you mean by 'run right', I'll suggest my best source
for PD CP/M software especially in the 'C' vein as:

C Users Group
2601 Iowa St.
Lawrence, KS. 66047
(913)841-1631

They offer their stuff in a wide variety of disk formats at a very
reasonable rate.  They offer two catalogs of available software as
well as a monthly magazine 'C Users Journal'.

If memory serves me correctly isn't the Superbrain what they originally
stuck into the Kaypros albeit with a different disk?

Hope this helps.

Luke

   I just received word that the Trenton (NJ) Computer Festival will be
held April 21 & 22 this year.  The location has been changed to Mercer
County College though.  The flyers are not out yet but if you want to be
put on the mailing list send a postcard to:

     TCF Database

asking to be put on the mailing list.  They are reportedly preparing the
flyers now since some of the arrangements for the new location have just
been completed.

I have successfully run Z80MU under the DOS WINDOWS on our Sun 4
(SparkStation 1).  I didn't test it exhautively, but it seemed to run
WordStar, Turbo Pascal, and Turbo Modula II without difficulty.
It will probably run under any decent(?) MESSYDOS emulator for UNIX.
I always wanted to try it on one of the DOS-73 coprocessor board for
the UNIX-PC's.

Z80MU runs under VP/ix under XENIX 386 and I assume UNIX 386.  Very 
strange - LU in one window and GNU EMACS in another......
