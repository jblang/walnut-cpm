Hello NetLand -

     Just received my Aug. issue of Dr. Dobbs and read the complaint
regarding DRI's RMAC compiler.  So I hauled out my copy (came with my
CPM+ stuff, haven't implemented it yet) and typed in the sample bug.

     How this ever escaped DRI just flat out mystifies me.  Or maybe this
is "industry standard"?

     Has anyone seen a reasonable fix for it?

Subject: LDR Problem
In-reply-to: Msg of 1 Aug 1984  09:21-MDT from decvax!mcnc!decvax!mcnc!ecsvax!emigh at Berkeley

Hi, Ted,

	Your report of problems with LDR is interesting.  No, no one
has reported having any similar problems.  I notice a few items from
your report:

	1. First, since you did not assemble LDR, you should have
received a distribution version.  It contains a Class 1 Environment
Descriptor and you should see the address of your Environment
Descriptor buffer at 109H and 10AH.  I recommend that you check the
original CRC against the value in the distribution list to make sure
that you have a good copy.  Also, after running Z3INS on LDR, load
LDR.COM with DDT and check 109H-10AH to see that the address of your
Environment Descriptor is properly in place.  LDR.COM should extend
from 100H to 0AFFH (next PC is 0B00H).

	2. I highly suspect the LDR.COM that you have as being invalid
since you report a "DIRALPHA -- Pointer Error" message, and there is
no such message inside of the distribution version of LDR.COM.  This
particular message comes from the SYSLIB2 DIRALPHA routine and, as a
rule, should never appear anyway, since it indicates that the
pointer-based sort routine failed.  If someone tried to reassemble LDR
with SYSLIB2 instead of SYSLIB 3, they would have had to change the
source and would now be bringing in all sorts of older routines which
should not be there, such as routines which deal with disk-based named
dirs.  In short - one absolute mess.

	3. You are quite correct in the loading sequence.  Once LDR
has been installed, it contains only a pointer to an Environment
Descriptor.  This descriptor must be resolved first, and then the
other System Segments may be loaded.  This is a common mistake which
is made the first time around, and it looks like you avoided it.

	That is the analysis I can offer from the information you gave
me.  It sounds like your source does not have the correct files,
offhand.  You might want to consider going with the Echelon
alternative, because for only $39 you can get a complete starter kit
and a hard copy of the installation manual and Sampler without having
to worry about corrupted or modified files (a CRC list is provided).
This also ties you into the support system of Echelon and gets you a
subscription to the newsletter (of which issue 4 is now coming up).
The newsletter, among other things, talks about questions that people
have been asking on a recurring basis and may resolve some of your
problems before you encounter them.  SIMTEL20 contains the CRC lists
if you don't have access to one.

Rick,

  I have been getting ZCPR3 in pieces.  Looks good, BUT...

  I often have trouble loading SYS.ENV.  (In fact, I almost always do).
I can boot ZCPR3.  I look at the various areas, and they are all initialized
correctly. (Basically the same as the one given in the Installation guide,
but my NorthStar prom is at E800H, so the addresses are somewhat shifted).
My SYS.ENV is a Class 1 Environment.  When I issue LDR SYS.ENV, one of
several things happen:
If LDR.COM is installed with SYS.ENV, then my system dies.  Sometimes it
will reboot the system (Jump to around E800H).  By some quirk, after it
reboots, LDR will load SYS.ENV correctly.
If LDR.COM is installed with a Class 2 SYS.ENV, I get the message
"DIRALPHA -- Pointer Error".  However, SYS.ENV is loaded, and further
LDR commands will execute correctly.

Under any case, once SYS.ENV has been loaded correctly, it will reload without
any problem (and will then load SYS.*).

The cold boot loader is similar to my working copy for ZCPR2.  I don't have
the source for LDR.COM yet, but am trying to get it, then I can trace it.
Until then, I wanted to know if anyone else has mentioned this problem to you.
I'll keep you posted to whether this is my problem or a problem with LDR.

You have a good point ... it is certainly not too late to correct.
The reason I did that was because, while \n represented the LF char
literally, the effect of using it with routines like PRINTF was to
issued CRLF.  Hence, I elected to let \n mean CRLF and \l was added
for LF only.  I think I'll move back to \n meaning LF only and either
not have a char for CRLF (it is easy enough to create a word for it)
or make up something.

Re:   ZCPR3 Phase 2 ...

It all sounds very interesting.  Can't wait to see it.

One question; you appear to be using a lot of C conventions, which is
very nice, why this funky little incompatibility?


>		\l	Line Feed Char (LF)
>		\n	New Line char (CRLF pair)
>		\r	Carriage Return char (CR)

Was it really necessary to have <crlf> available as a single unit?
If so, why not create a new notation for it such as "\$" ?  The way
you have it, you have broken two of the most important C character
notation conventions.

Now if you were to provide the facility to have newlines (0xa) be converted
to crlf's on output that would be useful.

Keep up the good work.

Hello NetLand -

     I'm looking for pointers to or reviews of task scheduling programs
that will run under CP/M-80.  If you've used any of the Critical Path
Method (or maybe not CPM, I'm not picky) programs, I'd appreciate your
responses to a couple of questions:

- What kind of support are you receiving from the vendor or software
  house that wrote your scheduler?

- Is source code available to allow 'tweaking'?  If not, do you consider
  it flexible enough to not need it?  What language is it written in?

- Any and all quirks/bugs you had problems with during installation?

- Ease of use? (from 1 to 10, 1 = easy, 10 = need guru)

- A public-domain program would be acceptable if the documentation
  was well-written.  Have you seen one?


     Please reply directly to me.  Summary requests will be honored.

     Thanks in advance -

There are Critical Path Method programs available here in our archives
at SIMTEL20.  Here's a list:

Filename			Type	 Bytes	 Sectors     CRC

Directory MICRO:<CPM.BASIC>
CPM-PERT.BAS.1			ASCII	 10288   81 =  51H  074DH
This is the original program.  Use SETUP.ASM with it - see instructions.

CPMPRT51.BAS.1			ASCII	 11129   87 =  57H  3B3DH
This is an improved version.  Check it out - it may be much better for
your application.  Does not need SETUP.ASM.

SETUP.ASM.1			ASCII	  1161   10 =   AH  4C3FH
This is a short assembly-language program to allow easy on-off
switching of the output of CPM-PERT to your printer.

Since the last time bishow (a CP/M80 program to display a text file) was
posted to net.sources, several significant changes have been made.  In
particular, the following changes have been made since version 1.08:
	- lf's in file ignored. adds lf after each cr (can display F80 files)
	- introduced double buffering of file -- gives significant
	  improvement in positioning across buffer boundaries with floppies
	- added routine to position to end of file
	- fixed EXIT bug so ALL pending console characters get deleted
	- moved changeable routines to beginning of program
	- added option to clear screen before a page display
	- added option to display sign-on message
The current version number is 1.11.  If you would like a copy of
bishw111.asm and bishw111.doc, please send mail to the address below.
If there are sufficient requests, I'll post it to net.sources.  For
those of you on the ARPA side of the net, I'm arranging to get it
put on SIMTEL20 -- although it feels good to finally have some software
on the USENET that is not on SIMTEL20 :-).

I must admit to being a bit on the novice side of this, but...

Why couldn't one get the source to the BDOS and just reassemble
the monitor with the BIOS and ZCPR (or whatever)? Wouldn't this
pretty much obviate the need for MOVCPM?

The November (or was it December) issue of Byte mentioned a company
that sold a CPM disassembler that supplied comments.

Subject: ZCPR3 Utilities

	I have been receiving some reports recently stating that
people are reassembling the utilities rather than simply installing
them.  To date, I know of only one utility for which this is necessary
-- ZEX.  Problems have been reported with ALIAS and LDR in this
regard, and I have verified that this is unnecessary with LDR and I
have not checked ALIAS yet.

	Each ZCPR3 utility contains a pointer to the ZCPR3 Environment
Descriptor, and this pointer is the ONLY system-dependent part of the
utility.  To prove the point, I edited my Z3BASE.LIB file, changing
every value therein, and reassembled LDR.  Upon running DIFF, only one
byte was different -- the value of the pointer to the Environment
Descriptor.  It is this pointer that is altered when Z3INS is run.
Note that Z3INS has to be run on EVERY utility in order for it to be
installed.  If you think you have found a utility which this is not
the case for (ie, you have to reassemble it in order to get it to
work), then run my little test.  Assemble it with two different
Z3BASE.LIB files and compare the two resulting COM files.  If they are
different in any place other than the pointer at locations 109H and
10AH (from org 100H), please let me know.  This rule, of course, does
not apply to ZEX and you may find two pointers in ALIAS -- I will be
checking ALIAS this weekend.

	I have yet to duplicate Ted's reported problem with LDR,
having installed ZCPR3 six times so far with two different Environment
Descriptor locations.  Am working with Ted to see if the problem shows
itself to me.  Until then, I'll assume that the problem is not in LDR
but in his SYS.ENV or some other place.

	Frank Gaude has reported that ZCPR3 is now installed on over
60 different types of systems with, supposedly, 60 different
configurations.  In providing support, he has noted that most of the
questions from the people trying to install the system were already
answered in the Installation Manual.  You just had to find the
answers, and people were evidently a little overwhelmed by the size of
the manual and didn't read the whole thing before trying to install
the system.   May I recommend that the installers be sure to read the
manual over at least once before making the attempt?  This could save
you a lot of frustration in the long run.  Now that the autoinstall
Z3-dot-com is running in beta test satisfactorily (so I am told), it
should not be long before anyone can install ZCPR3 on whatever system
they may have.  Under Z3-dot-com, the installation procedure is
drastically simplified.  I should be able to review it soon (in a week
or so).

	I have seen four ZCPR3 newsletters so far from Echelon.  They
are coming out every two weeks now.  The last two addressed and
clarified several installation questions.  Frank has offered to send
me copies on disk so I can put them on SIMTEL20 for you to see.  I'm
not sure if I'll be doing this for many newsletters, so if you are
really interested in keeping up with Echelon, you might want to
subscribe.  If you purchased your ZCPR3 from Echelon, you are
automatically on the list.

	The book, which is going to the publishers on Monday for final
edit, will have a whole package on installation, and I am including
more than the original installation manual had.

	More later.

In-reply-to: Msg of 3 Aug 1984  06:40-MDT from Hilgert.WBST at XEROX.ARPA

Hi, Ron,

	Yes, I do have a suggestion on this.  I have a special login
program that runs under ZCPR3 which identifies the user as a wheel as
a result of his login.  At this point, it leaves a message saying that
the user is a wheel or not and sets or resets the Wheel byte.  LOGIN
is run from a startup alias, and the command after it is an IF that
does one thing if the user is priveleged and another if he is not.  If
he is priveleged, it sets his path to one thing.  If he is not, the
user gets a different path.  Once the STARTUP alias ends, the non-priv
user is in one directory (which cannot access the PATH command) and
the priv user is in another (which can run anything).  If I have time,
LOGIN will be cleaned up and released with Phase 2 ... if not, it will
be released later.  In either case, this concept will be documented in
the book.  In that way, there is no need to have OBJ files versus COM
files around.

 I have been tied in knots with school work and don't have the time to
download,install etc.. But I would love to use it.

 Please reply to the undersigned..

Subject:  Public Domain Software Documentation

        The New York Amateur Computer Club, Inc, has published  a
series  of  DOCUMENTATION catalogs of the public domain software.
There are 7 catalogs so far, each containing over  200  pages  of
documentation  on  public domain software.  This documentation is
almost exclusively copied from the  documentation  files  on  the
public domain disks themselves.

        I skimmed through all 7 catalogs this afternoon, and they
seem  to  be  quite worthwhile to get.  As I see it, they provide
three main services:

                1) they provide a good  overview  of  the  public
domain  software in SIG/M and CP/M UG; more than just listing the
names of the files/programs on these disks, the documentation  is
included, so you can scan the documentation to see what you real-
ly are dealing with before you acquire the disks

                2) they provide a HARD COPY of the documentation;
once  one  obtains  a disk of software, he usually wants to print
out  the  documentation  anyway;  these  catalogs  are  in  good,
letter-quality print and contain tables of content

                3) they consolidate  the  information  on  public
domain  software and are provided at a reasonable cost (the NYACC
sells them at just slightly above cost, and the profit is used to
fund club activities)

        Several people have been expressing  concerns  about  the
ZCPR2  and  SYSLIB  documentation.   Among other things, the last
three catalogs contain ALL of the ZCPR2 and SYSLIB documentation.

        The catalogs contain the following information:

Book 1 (204 pages):  CP/M 1 to 49; SIG/M 1 to 18
Book 2 (214 pages):  CP/M 50 to 54, 78, 79 (CP/M 55 to 77 are reissues of
        SIG/M 1, 2, 11, 4-10, 13-25 resp); SIG/M 19 to 42
Book 3 (217 pages):  SIG/M 43 to 60
Book 4 (210 pages): CP/M 80 to 84; SIG/M 61 to 76
Book 5 and Book 6 (400+ pages): SIG/M 77 to 106 (ZCPR1 is in SIG/M 77
        and ZCPR2 is in SIG/M 98 to 108; SYSLIB is in SIG/M 88 to 90,
        106 to 108)
Book 7 (200+ pages): SIG/M 107 (SYSLIB documentation)

        For those interested in ZCPR2 and SYSLIB, Books  5  to  7
contain good hardcopies of all of the documentation.

        Each book costs $10 (including shipping) in North America
and $15 (via airmail) overseas.  All orders must be prepaid in US
Funds.  The address to write to for ordering the books is:

I've recently received modem730 from Keith Petersen for the

This program is my main interface to UNIX. It seens that the

In-reply-to: Msg of 1 Aug 1984  12:25-MDT from ihnp4!pegasus!cmf at Ucb-Vax.arpa

The problem of MDM7 "eating ESC characters" (in the terminal mode) is
caused by the way you have an option set in the user overlay.  Look
for an equate which says it will "filter out" control characters.
Change it so it does not do that.  This option was put in for people
who had problems with noisy phone lines and wanted a measure of
protection against funny things happening to their terminals.  When
you change the equate, you'll get the full range of characters and
EMACS and other cursor-oriented software on your mainframe will work
properly.  It's too bad that almost all of the overlays were
distributed with the equate set to filter out control characters -
this has caused a lot of unnecessary head-scratching and some people
even quit using MDM7 because they thought there was something wrong
with the terminal mode when they couldn't use EMACS.

Re:   MDM7 overlay for Kaypro allows 4800 baud

I  have  modified M7KP-2.ASM in several ways that serve my needs.
Others may have similar needs, and  may  find  the  revised  file
(M7KP-X48.ASM) useful.

The  primary  purpose of the mod is to facilitate the direct 4800
baud (i.e., RS-232 to RS-232, without phone  lines)  transfer  of
files  to and from KAYPROs.  I find that very useful -- I do some
work on the Kaypro, or my  subcontractors  do,  and  then  I  can
upload to my S-100 and continue to process the data into a single
report.

This  can easily be done with three wires.  I explain in the file
how to do it, including a diagram for a simple cross-over  switch
to  match  the other computer's RS-232 configuration (I installed
such a switch into the RS-232 connector itself).

But most importantly, the file is set up so that by saying YES or
NO to two equates, one can also  assemble  it  for  normal  modem
operation,  and one can set it up to run off the KP-n-84's serial
PRINTER port.  That is useful if you do not want to  unplug  your
regular modem whenever you want to transfer a file direct at 4800
baud.

Hello Keith -

     I've got a couple of questions regarding copyrights and such on
software released to the SIMTEL20 CP/M archives.

     A local firm has asked me for some help with their office problems
and they are willing to lay out some bucks for my efforts.  For me, as
I'm currently unemployed, this could be a lot of fun as well as maybe
profitable.

    Some of the stuff they want done I'll have to write myself.  But a
good chunk of other things they want live in the 'public-domain' -
LU.COM, SQ.COM, USQ.COM, etc., etc..

    Keith, I was thinking of sending them utilities and only charging
them for my efforts in transmission and maybe some customizing efforts.

    Should I contact all the authors of the above mentioned packages and
set up some agreement with them?  This stuff is *NOT* for re-sale, just for
in-house use.  Heck, I don't know if I'm even allowed to charge for
transmission of these and other utilities.

    Your help is appreciated.. (I'm just flat out confused by all these
conflicting rules on 'copyrights' after seeing all the stuff fly by
regarding Irv Hoff and MDM7xx).

You may give away any of the public-domain programs without contacting
the authors.  It doesn't matter that these programs will be used for
commercial applications UNLESS the program documentation specifically
prohibits commercial use.  Even then, unless it's copyrighted that
doesn't mean anything.  Public-Domain is Public-Domain - for ALL to
use in any manner they deem fit.

Public-Domain programs should not be sold for profit, but a
"reasonable" charge can be made for copying and/or customization as
required.  The definition of "reasonable" is vague, but I'd say you
should let your conscience be your guide.  Charge only a small fee for
copying and make your money on a per-hour labor charge for
customization.  Typical free-lance computer consultant fees are $25 to
$50 per hour or "by the piece" if it will take too many hours to make
using the "per-hour" charge practical.  What you charge for an hourly
fee will be decided by what the traffic will bear and by what value
you place on your time.  Don't under-sell yourself and don't forget
your overhead costs, such as disks, computer time, travel, phone
calls, overtime, etc.

	Echelon has it running on the Kaypro-10.  I'm not aware of any
other Kaypro-specific installation, but the auto-install should
eliminate that problem readily.  The auto-install is still in beta
test and I'll be able to report more when I see it.

Speaking of all the C compilers that you people have been rating,
I have a problem with mine.  It lacks an INP() statement.
The compiler is Software Toolwork's C/80 compiler version 3.0
for a Heath/Zenith-89.  Has anyone written one for it?  I'm
told that it would be an extremely easy routine to write, but
unfortunately I never learned assembler.  All it needs to do
is input the byte on a given port and return it.  If anyone
could give me a pointer in the right direction to such a statement
I would be eternally greatful...

Re:   ZCPR3 MENU QUESTION

Hello again Rick,

I have a question regarding ZCPR3 menu's.  They don't seem to 
behave like the ZCPR2 menu.  My hard disk system has several
named directories, each with its own menu.cpr.  Under ZCPR2,
I could invoke 'CD newdir' from the menu, and the new menu.cpr
in newdir would take over.

Under ZCPR3 I have a problem.  I renamed menu.cpr to menu.mnu.
While executing menu.com, the menu is displayed as before.  But,
when I ask for 'CD newdir:', it says its going to the new directory
(message from CD), but give's me the original menu, not the menu
in newdir.  Also, I don't seem to remain in 'newdir'.  Doing ^C
after the 'CD newdir:' command, I'm still in the original directory.

What is the correct way under ZCPR3 to move from one menu to another.
I tried the command 'cd newdir:;menu' which works, but installs one
shell over the other, i.e., ^c from newdir menu returns me back to
original menu, not >prompt.  Therefore, the stack will probably
overflow if I move freely from menu to menu?  What am I missing?

Thanks,

Doug.

Subject: ZCPR3 MENU QUESTION
In-reply-to: Msg of 5 Aug 1984  17:53-MDT from DGILBERT.ES at XEROX.ARPA

	That is a very good question, Doug.  One key difference
between MENU under ZCPR3 and MENU under ZCPR2 is that the ZCPR3
version notes where it executes from and drops a boat anchor there.
In this way, the user can move about under a menu as he desires and
always return to home base automatically so the original menu can be
found.  The MENU under ZCPR3 is a Shell.

	If you want to go to a difference directory while under a
ZCPR3 MENU and stay there, you have to (1) clear the current shell,
(2) log into the desired directory, and (3) invoke a new Menu Shell
with the new menu.  The SHCTRL POP command clears the current shell,
CD DIR: or DU: or DIR: logs you into the new directory, and a MENU
command of whatever form establishes the new menu.  If you want to
NEST your menus (ie, be under one MENU in one directory and also under
another MENU in another directory at the same time), then do as
described but do NOT clear the shell stack.  That is, log into the
desired directory (via CD DIR: or DU: or DIR:) and issue a MENU
command.  You now have two MENU shells on your shell stack, and you
will stay in the second directory under the second shell.  When you
exit this shell (say, via ^C), you will pop back to the first
directory under the first MENU.  Neat, huh?

Doug's solution is also correct (see below).  I personally prefer
SHCTRL POP because if you are under another shell in the current MENU,
then the outer shell is not lost.  Doug's solution is perfectly
reasonable.  I think he is getting the ZCPR3 mind-set!

Re:   zcpr3 menu - a solution

RICK,

IF YOU READ MY OTHER MESSAGE.....I JUST FIGURED OUT ONE WAY..

USE 'SHCTRL CLR' AS FOLLOWS:  TO CHANGE TO ANOTHER MENU ALA'
ZCPR2, USE THE COMMAND  'SHCTRL CLR;CD newdir;MENU'.  THIS
KEEPS THE STACK UNDER CONTROL.  Is this the correct solution?


Thanks,

Subject: dBase II .cmd Program Beta-Testors Wanted
To: info-cpm@Amsaa.ARPA
Cc: rbloom@Apg-1.ARPA

Long message for dBase II People:

I need up to four dBase II knowledgeable persons to be willing to Beta-test a 
dBase II program I've written.  The program will be released to the PD 
community after test.  (This will be the first time I've released a major 
effort to the world - I'd like to know if there are any bad bugs before the 
unsuspecting world gets it.)

The program is called "PMS" for "Project Management System" and is used to 
manage the milestones, financial info, and other data of interest on a 
project basis.  Additional information and parameters are attached below.

Testers should have a good knowledge of dBase II command files as some (and up 
to a great deal of) customization is to be expected.  (Nobody's milestones 
will be identical to mine and the "data of interest" will vary based on the 
type projects tracked.)  A hard disk is recommended as a complete PMS system 
with all options activated, the documentation, and several project files may 
take a mega-byte or more.  For instance, a file list on my HD (4k block size - 
18Meg HD divided into 13 "Logical" drives of 1 and 2M bytes) shows the PMS 
related files as:

     Drive:B  User:1  Files:35     Space used:360k  (572k Free)
          (16 PMS Project dBases)
     Drive:D  User:1  Files:104     Space used:952k  (940k Free)
          (dBase II and all of the *.CMD and *.DOC files of PMS)
     Drive:E  User:1  Files:33     Space used:440k  (516k Free)
          (15 PMS Project dBases)
     Drive:G  User:1  Files:29     Space used:256k  (488k Free)
          (13 PMS Project dBases)
     Drive:J  User:1  Files:5     Space used:20k  (360k Free)
          (1 PMS Project dBase)

     Don't let these figures scare you completely off - the 66 .CMD files 
alone take "only" ~325k and the whole thing is highly modulized so that it may 
be trimed down for particular applications.  One does not needs the multiple 
disks as shown above - a megabyte should hold a nice size working system.)

     After I sort out the replies (if any) to this message, we'll work out a 
method to transfer the files to the testors machines.  (I've a NorthStar so 
there is a definite media problem.)

PMS is a set of dBase II "command files" that serve to manage milestone 
schedules, financial actions, and administration data on a project by project 
basis.  The full-blown system includes facilities for:  (limits are program 
limits - disk size limitations will probably be the driving factor.)

     * Up to 800 milestones per project, each with an original date, actual 
date, up to 10 revisions, and each date may have an optional cross-reference 
number to a comment.

     * routines for easy revision and completion of milestones, each with the 
capability of adding comments as part of the revision/completion.

     * up to 99 comment records per project with up to 150 characters per 
comment.

     * unlimited number of projects, however, only 30 may be displayed in the 
project selection menu.  (There is a way to call projects not in the menu.)

     * All the information for one project is held in one file (and one .ndx)

     * completely menu driven - the user need not know anything of the 
underlying dBase II structure, programming language, or commands.  (Knowledge 
of these is necessary to modify the system however.)

     * Two levels of prompting - "expert and novice".

     * A unlimited number of Points-of-contacts may be held for each project, 
each containing name, agency, address, attention line, and phone number.

     * Adminstrative type data is held for each project - names, numbers, 
responsible persons and agencies.

     * Financial actions - requested, received and distributed funding, are 
held for each project.

     * A financial plan, i.e. how much is planned to go for what, is held for 
each project.

     * 10 different reports in three major areas (administration, milestones, 
and financial) are available.  Reports may be "stacked", in which multiple 
reports on multiple projects may be all output continuously without additional 
user input.

     * reports may to output to printer, terminal or file.

     * (rudimentary) facilities for retrieving information from a project 
historical file.

     * highly modular, easily modified.  The total coding size is >300k, but 
may be reduced by eliminating modules.

     * facilities for viewing a correctly any record in the data base without 
resort to any of the dBase II editing commands.

Documentation files include:

      READ-ME.PMS - facilities of PMS, where to look for more help, and short 
                          instructions on how to install
          PMS.DOC - user documentation
          PMS.INS - detailed installation instructions
          PMS.HLP - help for customization, program notes
          PMS.STR - table of the structure of the project files
          PMS.RPT - Sample reports

	The ZCPR3 Book - the WHOLE thing - went to the publisher
yesterday.  Two editors have been working on it for a couple of weeks
now, and there are no problems reported.  Three editors will start
work on it Thursday or so, and no problems are anticipated at this
time.  The release of the book is currently set for the first of
October - in hardbound (I think) at a list price of $19.95. The draft,
as printed by my exhausted Toshiba, is 500 pages long, including a
10-page table of contents and 15-page index.  The book is entitled
"ZCPR3: The Manual", as opposed to the next book (no contract on this
one yet), which is entitled "ZCPR3: The Libraries".  I will probably
upload a copy of the table of contents to SIMTEL20 soon so anyone who
is interested can see what the book looks like.

	Rick

PS - Here is the documentation that several of you have asked for.
Every command in all detail with a package of the book (consisting of
5 or 6 chapters) on the internal operation of the ZCPR3 System.

There has been the odd enquiry on the net for a utility to enable
translation of 8080 assembly source code to 8086 code.

XLT86 from DIG Research is one such utility which is written in PL/I and
will run on any 8-bit CP/M (or MP/M) system (min' 48K).

I understand there is also a VAX/VMS version (1600 BPI) for large
program translation,

Does anyone out there have any experience of this package???

     We have a vintage Imsai 8085 S-100 system with two 8" SS/SD drives
here that we are configuring as an RCPM system for out local clup.
(Mohwk Valley Microcomputer Club) All the software is finished and runs
well.  I purchased and installed the Optronics Technology timeout board
on the disk drives to reduce disk/head wear,since this board will be
operational 24 hours a day.
     Here's the problem:  The timeout board triggers on the "drive
select" line from the controller.  When it sees this signal, it turns
the 115VAC back on to the spindle motor.  Several seconds after the loss
of this signal, the board will power the spindle motor down.  This
system uses "Fischer-Freitas" CP/M 2.2.  I need to find someone who has
worked with this BDOS and can point me in the direction of how to patch
it to bring the drive select down after a disk read.  I'd do it myself,
but time is at a premium right now and I'd like to get this board on
line.
     Thanx much, in advance!

Cc: kushnier@nadc.ARPA

	I don't know how much applicability this has but here goes:
We had a Digital Group (aka AEON) system up with SS/SD 8" disks running CPM and
Oasis on a time shared basis. The disks would crash on power down intermittently
and the select lines had come high. The answer we got from DG was that they all
do that! We abandoned SD and installed DD disks with a new disk controller.
Result: three years without a controller glitch (one disk regulator failure).
Recommendation: Look at the disk controller before attacking BDOS as our 
problem was language independent.

					good luck,
					mlsmith@nadc.ARPA

P.S. A delay after disk read is normal - if the power on the motor shuts down
     immediately after completion some systems declared the previous data
     shipped bad and tried again resulting in endless retransmissions. Also
     some timeout boards include a longer delay >30 seconds to cover the
     random access file case where excessive cycling would occur.

Yes, I concur that with programs like SWEEP, security is basically
lost if you can get to them.  ZCPR3 offers a distinct advantage in
this arena in that for secure systems with the DU form disabled, then
the DIR form has to be used.  Each named directory has a password
associated with it.  So if the user types ROOT:SWEEP, then if ROOT has
a non-blank password, the user is FORCED to provide a correct password
before the system will log him in.  If he does not provide the correct
password, the ROOT: reference is changed (internally) to the current
directory.  The same is true for commands like TYPE DIR:PASSFILE.TXT,
since even for references in the argument fields, the password
protection holds under ZCPR3.

	"Dangerous" commands should be placed into a named directory
which is not in the command search path.  If you want even more
security, have the login sequence DISABLE the reference in the named
directory to this "secure" directory, so its NAME is not even
available to the user.  With DU disabled and no NAME, a directory
CANNOT be referenced unless a tool like SWEEP which bypasses the
protection system is used, and hopefully the path protection with the
named directory reference will stop that.

Found a serious weakness in security

With user areas restricted to 0-9, a user in 0: can type:

11:sweep2<ret>

Then can use sweep to go to any user area as it over-rides bye limits

I have tried protect and password (whatever correct names are) to no
avail.

Possibly I have bye set for cpm 2.2 and not zcpr2 or nzcpr2. I am
using version of zcpr2 set up for security that eliminates some
commands. I was not sure which to use in bye as I had some trouble
when I set on zcpr2 or nzpr2. That may be due to difference in max
user set with genins and max user set in bye.

Subject: PCPI Appli-Card(tm) Drivers
Article-I.D.: ihuxp.816

The PCPI Appli-Card(tm) is a versatile CP/M(tm) card for
the Apple II (or IIe). Using the OEM software that can be obtained from
PCPI, one can write special purpose "drivers" that down load into the
Apple at boot time.  The card comes with a standard set of drivers for
controlling the console, printer, etc.  Supposely these drivers can be
relocatable or can be loaded into an absolute location at boot time.

Now to my question for those of you who have a PCPI Appli-Card...

I have been able to write a relocatable driver that allows one to call a
subroutine in the apple.  Yes I know that there is a general command for
doing this, but sometimes values have to be placed in the X, Y, and/or A
registers before calling the subroutine (eg., calling some of the
graphics subroutines in the Applesoft ROMs)--and that's what my driver
does.

My question is:  I am trying to make the driver so that it loads in an
absolute address (eg., at $4000 just above Hi-Res page 1).  I cann't get
it to work--my system hangs when I boot it with this driver installed as
an absolute loading driver (It works great as a relocatable driver.).

Can anyone give me a hint???

	Thanks!

I received my September Computer Shopper yesterday, and an ad cought my
immediate attention.  There in the classifieds, was an offer for "used"
software for the Z-100.  Some of the offerings were:  dBASEII for $85,
Wordstar with Mailmerge for $85, and Multiplan for $75.  Since I was in
the market for Multiplan, I called the number listed and asked for Jim.

Jim answered the phone and sadly informed me that Multiplan was sold.
He then, quite voluntarily and to a perfect stranger (me!)  said, (and I
paraphrase, not recalling his exact words) "Yeah, see, what I do is buy
this software, make a copy of it for myself, and then sell the the
original as 'used' software".

Incredible!

I finally got the degree of security I needed by setting BYE NZCPR YES
and USEZCPR NO. This unlikely mixture results in users being able to
use 0: thru 5: to switch user areas, but having to use CD to connect to
user areas 6 thru 9. With BYE set like this, 11:SWEEP results in a ?.
No more. I suppose the reason it will not accept 6: thru 9: is due to
something in the PUTSEC.HEX file so I will need to obtain PUTSEC.ASM
and make a change, if I can find it. I got the HEX file from Steve
Sanders, who now has PRO-COM RBBS/RCPM running extremely well on ZCPR3.

Do you agree on my assumption about PUTSEC.HEX?

I have CP/M dBASE, Version 2.4.  There appears to be a problem with the
"SORT" function.  Whenever I try to SORT ON <field> TO <file>, I get a
"END OF FILE FOUND UNEXPECTEDLY" message.  Not only that, but even after
a CLEAR, I cannot erase the destination sorted file without incurring a
FILE ALREADY OPEN message.  When I try another CLEAR followed by a USE
with the sorted destination file, I get a NO DATA BASE IN USE message.

Can anyone shed any light on this?  Is it me or my dBASEII?  Is there a
fix?

P.S.  I have verified correct format of the source file I'm trying to
sort.  Every time I QUIT out of dBASEII and re-enter it, USEing the
sorted destination file, all I ever see on a DISPLAY ALL is the first
record of the source file, repeated ad infinitum.  HELP!!

                          ZCPR3 Newsletter 001


Thanks for joining in our support for CP/M-80 systems.  As we present
this premier issue of the Newsletter, we look forward with a positive
and confident feeling that our new software fills an important niche in
your world.  The microcomputer industry was started, nurtured, made
viable, by 8-bit machines and Echelon doesn't intend to abandon them,
as many have been so quick to do!  We believe 8-bit machines are most
practical and cost effective for jobs you desire to perform.

You will find ZCPR3 provides a powerful set of tools to manage both your
present and future computing tasks.  Furthermore, the overall software
system represented by ZCPR3 is expanding with new application packages
to solve new business and personal problems, to integrate existing
programs in your library using concise and crisp menus, and to handle
day-to-day computer disk file maintenance.

WordStar (or WordMaster), SuperCalc, and dBase II are ideal candidates to
run from one menu under ZCPR3, because of their similar command structures.
TERM III and DISCAT work nicely with these, too.  The upgraded VFILER and
new VMENU utilities with ZEX batch processing will supply modern screen-
oriented, user-convenient control of all work normally performed by your
computer.  (VFILER and VMENU are contained in ZCPR3, Phase 2, out in a few
months.)  You quickly learn to write your custom menus from text material
supplied with ZCPR3 source and documentation files.

Echelon plans to operate a ZCPR3-related computer bulletin board.  But until
that time arrives, the 300/1200 bps AMPRO Computers, Inc. BBS (run by
Jerry Haigwood) may be used to carry ZCPR3 news items.  Your questions or
statements can be handled by Jerry's board.  The number is: 408/258-8128.
Questions we can't answer are referred to either Rick Conn or Joe Wright.

Joe is nearing completion of a universal auto-installing version of ZCPR3.
After beta testing, this version of ZCPR will be offered to those who believe
they can't install ZCPR3 by MOVING their system down, modifying their BIOS,
and using DDT to overlay the original code.  The price is expected to be
$149.00.  Both Alpha Systems Corporation and Echelon will offer the program
to the public.  More on its features as the program matures.

We enjoy hearing from you, about ideas you have relative to your experience
with ZCPR3, thoughts about features you'd like Rick to add, gripes and the
reverse -- let's hear from you.

						     Echelon, Inc.
						     101 First Street
						     Los Altos, CA 94022
						     Telephone: 415/948-5321



P.S.  The WHEEL byte password in the release version of ZCPR3 is the six
characters: SYSTEM.  DISCAT ships on 15 August, ZCPR3 Manual on 15 September.

August 20, and I will probably post it around that time.  I had mentioned
seeing 4 newsletters in my previous message, but I just noted that
two of them were advanced copies.

Disclaimer: I may or may not agree with everything said in these

Thanks for your enthusiastic support of ZCPR3 and the ZCPR3 System.  Early
reactions indicate a near revolution of new interest in 8-bit CP/M systems
is occurring.  Those who had left CP/M so quickly to follow a trail of hype
for pseudo 16-bit machines appear to be reconsidering what they thought was
the death of the 8-bit world!  Amen!  Let's face it: 8 bits are ideal for
personal and lap size computers.

No less than 9 major magazine articles are presently in the works.  Rick Conn
has a feature article in the October issue of COMPUTER LANGAUGE; USER'S 
GUIDE has one written by Tony Bove and Cheryl Rhoades, August/September issue
# 10; a comparison of ZCPR3 and PC-DOS 2.2 in DISCOVER by John Gliedman; John
also has one coming out in PUBLISHER'S WEEKLY.  Ezra Shapiro, BYTE west coast
bureau chief, has a shorty about it in October issue of that magazine and a
full-length feature in December.  Robert Blum of DR. DOBB'S JOURNAL devotes a
couple pages in their September issue thoroughly covering SYSLIB3 and some
review of ZCPR3 and the System.

Rick Conn is writing three articles in the coming months for MICROSYSTEMS
magazine: one each on the AMPRO BOOKSHELF series of computers, ZCPR3 and
SYSLIB3.  We hope COMPUTER LANGUAGE magazine gives some ink to SYSLIB3,
because this macro subroutine library clearly is in a LANGUAGE class by itself
and should be utterly newsworthy.

All these magazines seem ready-willing-able to report the features of 8-bit
ZCPR3 enhanced CP/M systems.

Lots of questions have come from interested users of ZCPR3 and those instal-
ling for the first time.  Careful reading and re-reading of SAMPLER answers
most questions ... still nothing is perfect for all levels of understanding.
So don't be embarassed to write us a line if there is something unclear after
several readings.  We are here to help!  The entire process of getting ZCPR3
and the utilities up and running is a grand learning experience -- well worth
the effort when you finally get to use the results.  ZCPR3: the MANUAL, soon
to be shipped will be a great aid to learning the ins-and-outs of Z3.  Until
that time, the online documentation is extremely helpful as is the "//" after
the command name.  The latter never allows you to be in the dark about syntax,
and such, for a command you are ready to use.  But for complete online help,
type:

				HELP ZCPR3

HELP.COM and all the .HLP files must be in the same user area along the search
path you've chosen.  The top ZCPR3.HLP file chains to the rest producing a
tree structure menu-driven help system.
.heZCPR3 Newsletter 002

Incidently, the LDR.COM loader program must be installed before it can be used.
Use Z3INS.COM, ZCPR3.INS and your SYS.ENV files to do this.  Type "Z3INS //" to
see how this is done.  Or patch the base page address of your Environmental
Descriptor at location 10AH of the utility object file, using DDT.  The release
version has F4 at this loaction; put yours in its place.

LDR is used to load all the system segments including MYTERM.Z3T.  MYTERM.Z3T
overlays a portion of your SYS.ENV segment.  This seems to have been a
stumbling block for a few of you.

Here at Echelon we use a STARTUP.COM file to initialize the corporate computer
at cold boot time.  It is created using ALIAS.COM.  Enter the string command
at ALIAS prompt:

         LDR SYS.ENV,SYS.RCP,SYS.FCP,SYS.NDR,MYTERM.Z3T;VFILER;B0:

Because MYTERM.Z3T overlays a portion of SYS.ENV, it should always be loaded
last.  Note all our Z3 utilities are in A15:ROOT> and we use B0: as our WORK>
directory.  Standard application programs (T/Maker III, Comm7, WordStar, etc.)
are in A0:BASE>.  STARTUP should be coded into your BIOS, before BIOS assembly,
to be the file executed just after cold boot.

Hints you think others may find helpful would be appreciated.  Pass along by
placing them as files or messages on the AMPRO BBS at 408/258-8128 or mail
directly to Echelon.  By the way, we use an AMPRO BOOKSHELF 122 (with
T/Maker III) for a significant amount of Echelon data and text processing.  It
has never failed in 8 months of near 24-hour a day service.  Super machine!

Phase 2 Release is in deep beta test now.  The utility extensions contained
in the next phase are significant.  VFILER has been upgraded from ZCPR2.
DU3 and MU3 are full-screen and cursor-oriented disk and memory editors.
VMENU permits cursor control in menus as well as screen highlighting.  SHSET
is used to make a SHELL of any application program, even programs like
WordStar and dBase II!  Several other new utilities are as useful.

We like SHOW, ALIAS, and MENU best of the original utilities.  MU3 is dynamite,
as is DU3.  It is thought system integrators will find VMENU most useful in
setting up turn-key systems for their customers.

Phase 2 should ship 3 September 1984, barring unforeseen major bugs.  Existing
owners of ZCPR3 may obtain Phase 2 two-disk set by sending $16.00 plus shipping
and handling of $2.00 to Echelon.  (The auto-install version of ZCPR3, now
called Z3-Dot-Com, a trademark of Alpha Systems Corporation of San Jose, is
soon going into beta testing.  More next issue.)

The Z3 System -- what a system of productivity tools!  You can create the
computer environment your dreams were made of.  Many large main-frames do not
have the power of ZCPR3 and the ZCPR3 System.

Next Newsletter has listing of sample BIOS buffers and a CBIOS.LIB file you
may find useful to complement your present knowledge of ZCPR3 techniques.

Long live 8-bit CP/M!  See you down the lines...

The same programmers that did Pascal will be doing these two,

Subject: New patches to speed up WordStar 3.3

WSFAST15.SUB is now available on SIMTEL20.  WSFAST11.SUB was the first
released version of this package.  It was originally written by
Steve Sanders to correct the annoying problem with slow sign-on of
WordStar ver. 3.3.   It has been enhanced and modified by adding
routines to eliminate the first two screens completely, allow the
printing of one document while editing another, and, optionally,
signing on the the B: drive at startup. 

The new files are:

Filename			Type	 Bytes	 Sectors   CRC

Directory MICRO:<CPM.WSTAR>
WSFAST15.DOC.1			ASCII	  4848  38 =  26H  D56DH
WSFAST15.SUB.1			ASCII	  5391  43 =  2BH  DE7BH
WSLSTPAT.HEX.1			ASCII	   100   1 =   1H  48DEH

       == REVISION HISTORY ==
                    
 Vers. 1.1  Steve Sanders   05/10/84

         07/06/1984         
                    
 Added fill patches to further speed up sign-on     
                    
 Ver 1.2 NOTE---> This fill patch overlays the MicroPro 
 copyright notice sign-on with nulls, it can only legally

 Revised menu patches from 1.2 and 1.3 with patch from  
 Mark Howard, CNY Technical RCP/M.  Added patch to allow  
 printer output while editing, without long delays when 
 the printer goes busy.  Patch modified from John G.  
 Donohue's version for WS 3.0.

Subject: Bubble memory problem (still)
Article-I.D.: dciem.1042

	Firstly, I'd like to thank those people who mailed me advice
regarding my problem with the bubble memory. Your comments were greatly
appreciated, but I still cannot PIP to the bubbles from disk.

	Here's a synopsis;:

1) The driver software for the bubble is patched directly into the BIOS.
System calls are screened to see if the bubble is being accessed, and if
so a jump is made to the appropriate routine. This works just fine.

2) I have tried filling the bubble memory entirely with 0xe5; this was
necessary as even DIR would not work without a BAD SECTOR error. DIRI can
now load a program, exit to cp/m and SAVE the program in the bubble, and
have the program appear on a directory. Furthermore, I can load the program
back from the bubble and run it with no problem.

3) I have double checked the DPH and DPB for the bubble but can see no
problem there. The fact that STAT DSK: works for the bubble seems to 
indicate that the parameter header and block are OK.

4) I can use ED to create a file in the bubble memory only if I specify
the new file name as a command trailer. Entering ED (cr) causes an error,
namely DISK OR DIRECTORY FULL.

5) PIP, when attempted, responds with the message - NOFILE = aA:xxxx.COM,
(where xxxx is the name of the file to be copied), yet STAT assures me
that I have space left in the bubble pack.

	Can anyone point out where the problem may lieie - in the BIOS, in
PIP or wherever?
				Thanks in advance,
					Steve.

  This message is of interest to owners (and prospective owners) of
  Andy   Johnson-Laird's  superb  THE  PROGRAMMER'S  CP/M  HANDBOOK
  (Osborne/McGraw-Hill), and is based on recent correspondence from
  the author.

  In the original edition, about two  pages  of  listing  were  not
  printed.  The missing listing is lines 04628 thru 04919 (see page
  261-262).   Anyone  who wants the missing lines can get them from
  the author's office: Johnson-Laird, Inc., 6441 SW  Canyon  Court,
  Portland  OR  97221.   Send  a SASE with a note on what you want.
  (Johnson-Laird said the  book  went  into  its  2nd  printing  in
  January  1984,  and  the  missing  material should be in that 2nd
  version.  But he is out of the country on a project and tells  me
  he has not seen the 2nd version.)

  Other errors in the book:

      .  page 64, figure 4-3, location 0153, correct to read:
                 JM   CTPX     (instead of MB  CTPX)

      .  On page 149, 7 lines from the bottom, there is a reference
         to  CCP+6.   That  reference  should be CCP+0.  The letter
         from  the  author  said  that  there  may  be  other  such
         erroneous  references,  for  CCP+6 is a CP/M-86 convention
         and thus the source of the error, but  he  has  not  found
         other such errors.

      .  page 258, line 03828, change this line to read:
                 STA  MOB$Character

      .  page 282, after line 09270, insert:
                 LXI  H,Disk$Control$5
         (Note:  after inserting that line the byte references will
         be offset by 3 bytes, if you type it all in  and  assemble
         it.)

  Finally, Johnson-Laird wants to know about any other bugs, typos,
  errors and what have you that anyone may spot.  Since he's not on
  ARPANET,  you  may  send  such information DIRECT to me (STORK at
  MIT-MC), and I'll relay to Johnson-Laird.

  If you have not yet seen the book, look at it.  If  you  buy  it,
  you'll  probably  not  lend  it  out  --  it's too valuable to do
  without for anyone who has any notion about playing  around  with
  8080 assembler and CP/M in general.

This repeats a message I sent a bnit earlier, only to discover it had
a lot of control charas that my word processor put in (nulls, etc)
that did not show on my screen but showed on the net.  Sorry about that.


  This message is of interest to owners (and prospective owners) of
  Andy   Johnson-Laird's  superb  THE  PROGRAMMER'S  CP/M  HANDBOOK
  (Osborne/McGraw-Hill), and is based on recent correspondence from
  the author.

  In the original edition, about two  pages  of  listing  were  not
  printed.  The missing listing is lines 04628 thru 04919 (see page
  261-262).   Anyone  who wants the missing lines can get them from
  the author's office: Johnson-Laird, Inc., 6441 SW  Canyon  Court,
  Portland  OR  97221.   Send  a SASE with a note on what you want.
  (Johnson-Laird said the  book  went  into  its  2nd  printing  in
  January  1984,  and  the  missing  material should be in that 2nd
  version.  But he is out of the country on a project and tells  me
  he has not seen the 2nd version.)

  Other errors in the book:

      .  page 64, figure 4-3, location 0153, correct to read:
                 JM   CTPX     (instead of MB  CTPX)

      .  On page 149, 7 lines from the bottom, there is a reference
         to  CCP+6.   That  reference  should be CCP+0.  The letter
         from  the  author  said  that  there  may  be  other  such
         erroneous  references,  for  CCP+6 is a CP/M-86 convention
         and thus the source of the error, but  he  has  not  found
         other such errors.

      .  page 258, line 03828, change this line to read:
                 STA  MOB$Character

      .  page 282, after line 09270, insert:
                 LXI  H,Disk$Control$5
         (Note:  after inserting that line the byte references will
         be offset by 3 bytes, if you type it all in  and  assemble
         it.)

  Finally, Johnson-Laird wants to know about any other bugs, typos,
  errors and what have you that anyone may spot.  Since he's not on
  ARPANET,  you  may  send  such information DIRECT to me (STORK at
  MIT-MC), and I'll relay to Johnson-Laird.

  If you have not yet seen the book, look at it.  If  you  buy  it,
  you'll  probably  not  lend  it  out  --  it's too valuable to do
  without for anyone who has any notion about playing  around  with
  8080 assembler and CP/M in general.

Is there any improved version?

	For those of you who don't know, there is an article about this

	What they describe is truely a great machine.  It can be just about
	whatever you want it to be.  Plug in a 6502 board and it is an
	Apple, moreso than a lot of the lookalikes/workalikes/clones etc.
	It supports all of the Apple calls to monitor routines (Also runs
	Zaxon which apparently the clones don't do so well).  Plug in an
	8088 and you have an IBM PC that runs like an IBM.  Or run the
	software that has been designed for it.  

	Obviously, you pay the price for this technology, you could buy an
	actuall Apple or IBM PC for less than the Dimension but of course
	then you wouldn't have the versatility.

I am not absolutely positive that the machine was a Dimension 68000 but
it was a machine quite similar (emulates apple, ibm, etc)..  Anyway the
story goes:

I went to a CP/M-UG meeting in Houston a few months back.  One of the machines
on demonstration was (probably) a Dimension 68000.  I listened to the rep.
going through all of the various features of the machine.  At one point he
was asked about mainframe communications.  He went into this claim that the
machine could communicate with ANY machine using ANY protocol.  The rest of
the conversation went something like:

ME:	"I seriously doubt that."
HIM:	"Sure it can."
ME:	"How do you do it?"
HIM:	"With translation tables."
ME:	"WHAT?"
HIM:	"Our machine uses THE [sic] standard serial protocol.  The secret is
	 we use translation tables to handle the various protocols."
ME:	"Could you give a more technical description?"
HIM:	"Sure.  The table is at address C000.  The serial port is at 30."
ME:	"Wait!  That is not what I was asking for."
HIM:	"Look, you said you wanted a technical description.  If you want to
	 be technical, I am going to have to talk HEX."
ME:	"I don't think we are communicating..."
HIM:	"Well, that's because we have an Engineer talking to a User."
ME:	"Sure, if that makes you the User."
HIM:	"NO!  I am the Engineer."
ME:	"OK, can this machine communicate with an IBM 370?"
HIM:	"Sure."
ME:	"How?"
HIM:	"Like I've been telling you -- over the standard serial protocol
	 using a translation table."

Fortunately, the place closed and I was saved from the intellectual torture
of an extended conversation with this clown.  John.

Lots of people are looking at the Dimension because they NEED to do things
the "older machines/technology" were doing!  But maybe a little faster,
a little more, etc., PLUS the new things newer machines/technology can do.
Unfortunately, I am hard pressed to be able to say what a Mac CAN do!
For sure, there doesn't appear to be too much programming going on!

I simply have not been convinced that the necessary tools are available,
AND that the Mac can in fact do the things that Apples, IBM PCs, CP/M, etc.
have been doing so well (and in so many, many different ways) over the past
few years.  No way I can recode all the possible utilities and applications
available RIGHT NOW and owned RIGHT NOW by my users for a Mac -- and even if
I could -- what's the Mac gonna be compatible with?

a contented CP/M /8-bit owner...

under CP/M.  I have been having trouble with the assembler skipping
instructions, and with CP/M not doing what the book says it should.

	Can anyone give me the names of some good books that explain
CP/M and MS-DOS?  I do not want the basic "This is a computer, this
is a power switch" type books.  I want books that explain CP/M for
the computer professional.  Specifically, I want to know the disk
formats for CP/M disks, how the directories are stored on disk,
how disk block allocation is done for CP/M, how to call CP/M from
assembly language programs, how to modify the operating system to
add my own special features, etc.  And the same type of information
for MS-DOS.

	I have been programming for over 14 years, and have over 2
years experience with the Intel 8086/88 and 80186/188 family of parts,
so I want books that have some depth.

	Thanks in advance.

Well, it looks like Digital Research had the last laugh on me when I posted
"the final solution". My apologies to anyone that tried it and had trouble.
It certainly never occurred to me that such a simple patch might be machine
dependant!

Having used the "solution" so many times and never encountering a problem,
I was surprised to get mail to the contrary. Sure enough, I checked it out
on a couple of friends systems and found one that didn't work. In particular
this was a Heath system. I know their BIOS is a little different, but that's
no excuse.

If the patch worked for you, great. If not, try changing only one or the other
of the jumps I identified. In the mean time, I will try to figure out what is
going on just as soon as this quarter is over at the UW (this friday), so stay
tuned for "The Final Solution: Part II".

Let's see now... where did I put that disassembly....

A friend is looking into buying a new system. He has the option of

compatible with 2.2, but I seem to remember messages here that indicated
some software will run on 2.2 but not on 3.0. Does anyone else remember
the discussions or have some clarifying information of this controversy?

Also, does anyone know of a C/PM users group located in the South Bay
area of Los Angeles, California? I know of the Xerox Users' Group, which
is primarily oriented around the Xerox 820, but since this is a C/PM
machine, it sort of qualifies. This users' group is, however, limited to
Xerox employees and family members. Are there any others?

with the directory. I can use ddt to load a program into
RAM, escape from ddt and SAVE the file in the bubble memory
without any problem. The file appears in the directory for
the bubble pack, yet I cannot PIP to the bubble without
getting an error - NO FILE - from PIP. Envoking ED from the
bubbles causes the error message DIRECTORY FULL to be returned.
	I am following the guidelines set out by Louis Wheeler
in his Byte articles, but he makes no mention of this type of
problem. I would appreciate mail from anyone who has an idea
as to how I may overcome this difficulty.

Subject: Q: CP/M-80 on the DEC Rainbow
Article-I.D.: aecom.768

I am having problems running CP/M 2.2 software on the DEC Rainbow
and could use some help from the net gurus.  Basically, the software
was written on 2.2 machines and gets brain damaged when run on the
Rainbow.  I assume that the problem is due to some change or lack of
support by the Rainbow's CP/M-80 for certain BDOS calls.

Firstly, just for the record, the software utilizes the following
BDOS (0005h) calls: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16,
17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 26, 28, 29, 30, 32, and 37 (yes,
it's a rather large program).  Would anyone be so kind as to verify
if the Rainbow supports these?  The manuals I have access to do
not contain this information.  Also, does DEC mention any changes
in their operation as compared to CP/M 2.2.

Does anyone know, in general, how compatible DEC claims to be (or
really is) with 2.2.  Many emulators do a pretty good job, others
don't.  I guess DEC's doesn't.

Additionally, does the BIOS support access to the jump table for
I/O (const, conin, conout, listout, listst, reader, punch) and
the select disk (SELDSK) function?

I'd appreciate it greatly if someone took the time to assist me
with this brain buster.  Thanks in advance.

I need the CBIOS.ASM for the EXIDY Sorcerer II.	 When I bought 
the system several years back, it came complete EXCEPT for the
CBIOS.ASM.  That file and its sister (BIOS.ASM), both came in
skeletal versions only, (at least on my disk).. an error, I've
been told.  But alas, EXIDY is no longer in business, and the
California dealer who sold this to us, no longer supports
EXIDY.

This is an EXIDY Sorcerer II, configured with two 5 1/4" disk
drives, soft sectored ssDD, operating on a CP/M 2.2/1f at 77
tracks.	 

If there is anyone out there who has a similarly configured
Exidy CP/M (the one that originally came with the machine, the
2.2x version..	NOT the one from LIFEBOAT), can get me, or let
me know where I can get the CBIOS.ASM file I need, I'd be very
grateful!

Re:   ZEX and RELS.UTL

Hi, Paul,

	Yes, ZEX can be installed without using RELS.UTL, but that is
not necessary.  RELS.UTL is public.  Since your friend obtained ZCPR3
from Echelon, he should be getting the newsletters, and newsletter 3
which is just now coming out (dated 20 Aug) mentions RELS.UTL in the
first paragraph.  You can use EX.COM instead of ZEX for a first-time
installation of ZEX by changing all the *.ZEX files to *.SUB (change
ZEX.ZEX to ZEX.SUB and then issue the command EX ZEX with RELS.UTL and
the other files mentioned in the beginning of the ZEX.ZEX file in the
current directory).  RELS.UTL, EX.COM, and MLOAD.COM (by Ron Fowler)
are on the AMPRO RCP/M and BBS at 408-258-8128.  They are also on
SIMTEL20, but I forget what archives offhand.  See the first paragraph
of the third newsletter for some more text on the subject (not much
more, tho).

I usually use COMPASC.COM for ASCII and COMPBIN.COM for binary - work OK

see a listing for COMP-12.ASM and .DOC in SIGM.VOL073 ("binary file

on the screen for transmission, etc.; and more difficult - sending CW to
the student and having him copy in block print on a graphics pad).

I have most of the Public Domain things from SIMTEL20 (various TTY programs,
the package on Packet Radio, some Morse programs), and would appreciate
pointers to any other available code.

I'm tentatively planning on using Commodore 64s, VIC-20s, or some sort of
smart workstation in that class, but would also be interested in anyone
who managed to use a nice fast micro to drive a number of workstations or
student input stations.

Last (the toughy) -- any software out there (commercial even) that'll take
handwritten (block print) characters from a cheap graphics pad and ASCIIze
it?  I've seen ads for the smart tablets (reputed to handle even longhand),
but they're still too expensive.

Thanks in advance (quite a help list, ne?)

I've had 3.0 running since March, and have had NO problems with the
software that I own.  All of it trundled over to 3.0 with nary a sneeze.

One thing to be careful of is that xfcb (extended file control blocks) will
not appear correctly to 2.2 if you take a 3.0 disk and try to read it
under 2.2.  That's ok, though, because you can turn xfcb-making on or off,
or even delete xfcb's.

Another thing to watch out for is fancy shell-programs that assume the ccp
does what it does in 2.2. (Since I own no fancy shell-programs, I guess
my first paragraph isn't as strong as it might appear).

    I have CP/M dBASE, Version 2.4.  There appears to be a problem with the
    "SORT" function.  Whenever I try to SORT ON <field> TO <file>, I get a
    "END OF FILE FOUND UNEXPECTEDLY" message.  Not only that, but even after
    a CLEAR, I cannot erase the destination sorted file without incurring a
    FILE ALREADY OPEN message.  When I try another CLEAR followed by a USE
    with the sorted destination file, I get a NO DATA BASE IN USE message.

I'm told that there is a very strange bug with the SORT function of
dBase II.  The way to get around it is to do an INDEX and then write
out the indexed file.  [So say the sharpies at Gifford Computer Systems.]

    Re:   Dimension 68000

    I am not absolutely positive that the machine was a Dimension 68000 but
    it was a machine quite similar (emulates apple, ibm, etc)..  Anyway the
    story goes:

    I went to a CP/M-UG meeting in Houston a few months back.  One of the machines
    on demonstration was (probably) a Dimension 68000.  I listened to the rep.
    going through all of the various features of the machine.  At one point he
    was asked about mainframe communications.  He went into this claim that the
    machine could communicate with ANY machine using ANY protocol.  The rest of
    the conversation went something like:

    ME:	"I seriously doubt that."
    HIM:	"Sure it can."
    ME:	"How do you do it?"
    HIM:	"With translation tables."
    ME:	"WHAT?"
    HIM:	"Our machine uses THE [sic] standard serial protocol.  The secret is
    	 we use translation tables to handle the various protocols."
    ME:	"Could you give a more technical description?"
    HIM:	"Sure.  The table is at address C000.  The serial port is at 30."
    ME:	"Wait!  That is not what I was asking for."
    HIM:	"Look, you said you wanted a technical description.  If you want to
    	 be technical, I am going to have to talk HEX."
    ME:	"I don't think we are communicating..."
    HIM:	"Well, that's because we have an Engineer talking to a User."
    ME:	"Sure, if that makes you the User."
    HIM:	"NO!  I am the Engineer."
    ME:	"OK, can this machine communicate with an IBM 370?"
    HIM:	"Sure."
    ME:	"How?"
    HIM:	"Like I've been telling you -- over the standard serial protocol
    	 using a translation table."

    Fortunately, the place closed and I was saved from the intellectual torture
    of an extended conversation with this clown.  John.

I have the same problem (only with a Kaypro 10 and MEX rather than a

The END OF FILE FOUND UNEXPECTEDLY usually happens when I used indexed
files, but you would not be sorting them is you used an index.  Assuming
that you can DISPLAY the file, then you must have a trashed file with an
EOF character somehow inserted.  If not, then kludge it by issuing a USE
or two in order to close the file, then USE it again and SORT to your
destination.  A little more information would pinpoint the proper kludge.

David,

I picked up a (teach) morse program from the Palos Verdes RCP/M, (when I
was in LA) so I suppose if you can dial up any of the BBS's that support
packet radio, that would be a start.

I have seen a demo of morse working on one of those Xerox "STAR" 8010
systems, all you do is highlight text, bug start and the dots & dashes
blurt out of its speaker! (not bad huh)

not being updated by the patch which simply removes the archived bit when the

clearing the archived bit) causes the same problem. Comments?

Subject: Umodem

I know someone who would like to dial into our Unix system and from
another Unix system (using the Unix "cu" command), then use a modem
program to transfer files.  We have the 4.2 BSD xmodem (from UCSD) on
our end.  Does anyone know how to do this?

Some problems encountered so far:  Executing xmodem on the answering
system and umodem on the originating system from within "cu" does not
work.  xmodem, tmodem, umodem, and uc all appear to be programs for the
answering Unix system. "cu" (version 7) appears to be able to redirect
output or input, but not both to the same program. I suspect that "cu"
needs to be called from the the originating modem program to establish
a terminal mode with the remote system.  Does anyone have a modem
program that will do this? Or does anyone have a Unix modem program
that has a terminal mode?

a few questions:

	1)  Has anyone had any experience with these drives.  Do they have
problems -- there must be a reason why they're so cheap.

	2)  Are they totally plug compatible with the Tandon TM-100-4 (which
my Zenith Z-90 uses).

	3)  What is the correct Mitsubishi model number for the double sided
96TPI drive (so I can verify what I order is what I think I'm ordering).

	I'd also be glad to hear (impartial) recommendations for a particular
vendor to buy from.

Subject: BIOS2RSX problem


The program BIOS2RSX was recently posted to the net.  It maps CP/M-2.2
BIOS calls into CP/M-Plus calls, allowing such programs as DU to run
under CP/M-Plus.  It works well, but recently caused me several sleepless
nights.  The problem was a loss of data in a CP/M-Plus submit file
after the first 128 bytes, IF one of the tasks invoked in the submit
file was a 2.2 program (with BIOS2RSX attached) AND that program did
disk writes.

It turns out that my CP/M-Plus uses the BDOS for blocking/deblocking
(as I am sure many do).  This buffer is not being flushed by BIOS2RSX
and can be overwritten by the 2.2 program.  The fix is to go into
BIOS2RSX and add the following code:

          MVI  C,030h    ;flush disk buffers
          MVI  E,0ffh    ; flush data buffers too
          CALL BDOS      

before any other disk activity is performed.  This seems to fix the
problem nicely.  Note that the problem will not come up if the blocking/
deblocking is done in the CP/M-Plus BIOS.

	You really want to use uucp to transfer files from one Unix
	machine to another.  It's the standard.  Is there some reason
	why you can't do this?

I do not want to use "uucp" because the it requires disk space for
spool files and human intervention to set up and maintain. In the next
couple of years we expect to have over 2000 microcomputer/workstations
on campus.  Many of those microcomputer/workstations will be Unix
systems with modems and terminal emulation software. The overhead in
maintain uucp links with 1000+ workstations would be to high.

So what I am looking for is a "xmodem" (cf. MDM7xx) program written in
C that will permit a user on a Unix system (eg. a Unix microcomputer)
to dial out to a remote Unix system, login to a remote Unix system (via
terminal access dial-up lines), execute a remote "umodem" program to
start a file transfer, escape back to the local program, and fire up
the local end of the file transfer.

Both umodem and the C versions of kermit already have "connect" modes
for making outgoing connections.  Neither directly support automatic
dialing, but this is pretty modem specific and trivial to add for
any given case.  Or, if you prefer, you can always dial out with
"cu," suspend the connection, and then use umodem or kermit for the
file transfers as you choose.

Such procedures would probably be adequate for the sorts of "occasional"
file transfers you apparently consider likely within your "network."

--Lauren--

P.S.  If you plan to use umodem, you'll have to look around for the version
with the connect feature.  There are a multitude of different versions
of umodem that people have spawned off from my original code.  So many,
in fact, that I no longer officially support umodem in any manner.

I recently purchased a new CPM Plus (version 3 CPM) system. I also have
standard CPM (version 2) on another computer. My question is "is it
possible to read version 2 disks on a version 3 system???" (I know
"Anything is possible", the real question is what program/utility do I
use and where do I get it.) Any help would be appreciated.

Thanks in advance,
Wesley Irish

Also...

Anyone familiar with the Kaypro II is aware of its little quirks. The
one that I would like to eliminate at the moment is the disk drive motor
on time. In most cases the drive turns off between reads, only to turn
on again seconds (or msecs.) later.  This results in excessive disk
access time. The Kaypro is slow enough as it is!

I am looking for some "standard" patch that will correct this and/or
other Kaypro II problems. I realize this (these) problem(s) may be
hardware limitations and/or need to be patched in the ROM or in the
BIOS. I'll entertain suggestions for any or all of the above.

Thanks in advance,

Wesley Irish

You didn't say if you were using an external
monitor.  If you were, try moving it away from the
drive; noise generated by the drive causes external
video image jitter.  I don't know what the hangup
problem is, but it may be related.

begin at location 2AFh to 2B3h.
 
            Location:  Old value        New value

                02B3:  09               00
 
I think there are two more bytes somewhere around 02E0h.  Has anyone found
these other two delays (if they exist) or know how to bypass that beginning
routine that displays the "text-graphics" title page?

To:   INFO-CPM-REQUEST@AMSAA.ARPA

I had a similar problem with my Osborne1 "A" (left) drive.
The drive would sound erratic, the (internal) CRT would 
be affected, it would produce (what started to be occasional 
and eventually became continual) boot errorsa, and it  
would lock up the drive .  I found I could still force it 
to operate by opening th e drive door, taking out the diskette,
and spinning the drive with my finger.  This technique worked
o.k. as a emergency quick fix, but is not recommended for 
the health of your system.  I then would re-insert the diskette,
and the system would continue (ussually), or totally crash 
(once in a while).  Finally, during a period where I was 
desperately trying to geet my machine back in operation, and 
not finding any local reapiar place willing to do the work
(including Xerox), I dug in with the O-1 Technical Manual 
and a friendly EE technical advisor.  The result was to 
discover an excessive ammount of "noisew" (using an oscilloscope)
in the drive controller board going to and comming from the 
drive motor.  Feling very adventurous and without any re-
course (it couldn't get worse), wew tll we took the drive motor
out, disassembled it , cleaned it (it was carboned heavily
and had some metal falacks in it) and put it back.  Believe
it or not, I was delighted to find it worked, and all my
problems had been solved.  kSince then I have found that 
Priority -One Electronics (see any Byte mag) is supposed to
carry parts for MPI disk drives, and should be able to replace
yours if you want to try this route.

I have been operating my O-1 frequently for over a month now 
and it still seems to be fixed.

Subject:  Re:  Osborne I disk drive problems

I am not an Osborne owner, but the symptoms you cite sound very much like
the power drain due to the disk drive may be causing variations of the
power supply voltage to the rest of the computer.  This could result from
a high resistance in the power feed at a point common to both disk drive
and computer.  I suggest you disconnect and clean every pluggable connector
in sight, and see whether that helps.  Another useful troubleshooting step
would be to swap the two drives.  If this causes the problem to move with the
drive (i.e., it's always the same physical drive) then you will know there
is something wrong with the drive.  If, on the other hand, the problem stays
with the position (i.e., drive B) then you can look deeper into the wiring.
If swapping the drives causes the problem to vanish, then it was probably a
dirty connector that got scrubbed a bit when you unplugged it.  If so, don't
stop there; clean it right, and you should be good for a while.

Subject: ZCPR3 Newsletters 3 and 4


	ZCPR3 Newsletters 3 and 4 are stored in MICRO:<CPM.ZCPR3> as
NEWS003.Z3 and NEWS004.Z3.  Newsletter 3 is quite long (more than 10
pages) and its subject is installation; it addresses many of the
common installation questions and provides another approach to
installation from a slightly different perspective than that in the
installation manual.  Newsletter 4 is mainly an editorial by Echelon
and several news tidbits, and it is MUCH shorter than 3.
	Enjoy!

Subject:  Yet another tops-20 CP/M utility.
To: INFO-CPM@mit-mc.ARPA

MAKLBR is a Tops-20 program for collecting any number of files into a single
.LBR file which can then be downloaded and handled with the usual
CP/M utilities (LU, LRUN, etc).  It can be used as an alternative to batch
mode transfers when the latter are unavailable or inconvenient.

The source is available on SIMTEL20 in MICRO:<CPM.TOPS-20>MAKLBR.MID.  To
assemble, do @MIDAS MAKLBR (if your site doesn't have Midas, complain to
your system staff).  Do @MAKLBR<cr> for a short explanation of command line
syntax.  Report bugs to me.

Subject: XCAT42 for diskette master catalog now available

XCAT42 (a part of MCAT, the Master Catalog Program for keeping a
complete diskette catalog) is now available on SIMTEL20.  Here's a
list of the new files:

Filename			Type	 Bytes	 Sectors     CRC

Directory MICRO:<CPM.CATLOG>
XCAT42.AQM.1			COM	 21120  165 =  A5H  E387H
XCAT42.ASM.1			ASCII	 30582  239 =  EFH  AA26H
XCAT42.COM.1			COM	  2816   22 =  16H  1512H
XCAT42.DOC.1			ASCII	  4526   36 =  24H  0896H
XCAT42.HEX.1			ASCII	  6867   54 =  36H  7073H
XCAT42U.COM.1			COM	  2816   22 =  16H  BC5BH
XCAT42U.HEX.1			ASCII	  6867   54 =  36H  AECFH

What XCAT does:

     XCAT uses the CP/M catalog file called MAST.CAT.  It makes a new
cross-reference file which it can then immediately print in paginated
format, or can put the new file directly to disk.  It can handle files
of any length, even if longer than available memory.  MAST.CAT files
with thousands of programs can be properly handled by XCAT.

     It loads in as much of MAST.CAT as available memory permits, then
rearranges the file in a cross-reference manner so duplicate copies of
the same program show what disks they are on.  Here is a small sample
which is obtained with the USER equate set NO:

     CAT     .ASM  -  106
     CAT     .COM  -  033  034  092  093  106  123  147
     CAT     .DOC  -  033  034  106
     CAT2    .COM  -  033  034
     CATALOG .HLP  -  051
     CBAS2   .COM  -  031  032  040
     CCP     .ASM  -  059
     CCP     .DOC  -  059
     CHECKERS.BAS  -  082

     Paul Traina has added a feature that will appeal strongly to those
with hard disks, or who otherwise like to have user areas to show where
to find a particular program.  An "USER" equate may be set, to display
not only the disk but the user area the program is on.  (The comparable
USER equate in MCAT should be set YES.)

     CAT     .ASM  -  106/05
     CAT     .COM  -  033/05  034/12  092/01  093/10  106/07  123/08
		      147/13
     CAT     .DOC  -  033/05  034/12  106/06
     CAT2    .COM  -  033/05  034/12
     CATALOG .HLP  -  051/00
     CBAS2   .COM  -  031/03  032/11  040/15
     CCP     .ASM  -  059/05
     CCP     .DOC  -  059/05
     CHECKERS.BAS  -  082/02

     Among other things, this allows you to quickly determine how many
copies of each file you have, and delete unneeded extra copies.  Up to
ten disk ID numbers are shown per line.  (7 when also displaying user
number.)  If more exist, a new line is started to continue the numbering.

     XCAT paginates when printing to the list device.  It asks several
questions for the operator to answer:

     1) Option of including 'space remaining' lines added by MCAT
     2) Option to make a disk file instead of printing
     3) Option to put tear tabs for roll paper every 11 inches,
              defaults to fanfold paper with no tear tabs
     4) Option to add spaces to the left margin
     5) Option to print the date
     6) Option to start at any page number
     7) Option to print "x" number of pages (defaults to all remaining)

     Not all printers have adjustable left margins.  You can readily
insert up to 9 extra spaces, faking an adjustable left margin.

     Any number of file names may be handled by XCAT.  With a 64k com-
puter having a typical size BIOS, around 3200 names may be handled
each pass.  It can handle up to 999 pages on the pagination before it
starts over.  This should handle at least 50,000 file names.  It takes
about one minute to handle a file with 3000 names.

     XCAT also shows the total number of files handled as well as the
number of "unique file names", since a great many of the total number
are duplicates.  This information gives the true count of different
files in the catalog.

Here is a list of other files associated with the MCAT package.  These
have not been updated but are included here for your convenience.

ReSent-Date: Sat 25 Aug 1984 18:37-MDT

I am getting ready to establish a local electronic BBS for deaf people
The system must be able to accept 5-bit BAUDOT code (old TTY's) as
well as 8-bit ASCII (new telecomm devices for the deaf).

Does anyone have experience with any such devices -- hardware/software
combinations?

I am now considering DEAFNET which is a software/hardware combination
(not yet commercially available).  It's set up on a TRS-80 Model
16B--the $7000 price tag for hardware, tho, may cause us to change tho
-- this is a fairly small town.  Other options are an 8-bit machine
(Apple or TRS-80), but the ability to have both BAUDOT and ASCII
terminals communicating with the same BBS.

Any suggestions will be appreciated!

Subject: MESSAGE makes self-printing .COM files

Al Jewer has just released MESSAGE, a short program that many readers
will find very useful if you have ever wished that you could easily
create a .COM file to print a message to the user.

This program is intended to make it easier to create message files
for RCPM and other CP/M systems. 

For instance, if you upgrade a utility on your system, you would want 
to tell the users to use the new file instead of the old one, 
for instance:
		TYPESQ no longer needed - use TYPE instead.

You can copy MESSAGE.COM with your text editor, (renaming it 
appropriately), insert your text (terminated with a $), and rename 
it to what you want. It can then be run DIRECTLY without assembly 
or loading!! 

The trick is that the program was written so that the machine instructions 
would all be ASCII characters. This means that when you edit the 
MESSAGE.COM file, the first line of 'funny' characters that you see
are actually the program to type the message!

When you edit this file, make SURE you use 'NON-DOCUMENT' mode, or 
the machine code on the first line of the file could get destroyed.
Do not alter the characters in the first line - they MUST be left
as they are. Start your message on the SECOND line of the screen, and
be sure to end it with a dollar-sign ($). 

Other uses: RCPM Wallchart, system information files, etc.....

Here's a list of the files available on SIMTEL20:

Filename			Type	 Bytes	 Sectors     CRC

Directory MICRO:<CPM.RCPM>
MESSAGE.ASM.1			ASCII	  2700   22 =  16H  B283H
MESSAGE.COM.1			COM	   256    2 =   2H  9358H
MESSAGE.DOC.1			ASCII	  1228   10 =   AH  5EA9H

Subject: SD-92 directory program now available

SD-92, the latest version of the Super Directory program, is now
available on SIMTEL20.  Here is a list of files, followed by a brief
description of all its features:

Filename			Type	 Bytes	 Sectors     CRC

Directory MICRO:<CPM.DIRUTL>
SD-92.AQM.1			COM	 66816  522 = 20AH  E412H
SD-92.ASM.1			ASCII	 93017  727 = 2D7H  E95CH
SD-92.COM.1			COM	  4096   32 =  20H  1D0CH
SD-92.DOC.1			ASCII	 16646  131 =  83H  6DACH
SD-92.DQC.1			COM	 10880   85 =  55H  8EE1H
SD-92.HEX.1			ASCII	  9986   79 =  4FH  53AFH
SD-92.INF.1			ASCII	  2484   20 =  14H  3530H

SD-92.LBR.1			COM	 83968  656 = 290H  F84AH
Note: the .LBR file is here for the convenience of those who want the
whole package and can FTP ITS-binary files.  It may be deleted later
if we need the disk space.

SUBJECT:  SD-92 super directory program
DATE:   07/27/84
NOTE:   SD-92 will skip over drives where the maximum user area as
	set in the drive/user look up table is negative.  This is for
	systems that do not have contiguous disk drive like the 
	XEROX 820 hard disk and the CCS hard disk systems.

SUBJECT:  SD-91 super directory program
DATE   :  07/27/84
NOTE:	SD-91 works automatically with any number of disk drives, up to
	16.  If a disk has been left out of a drive, the program passes
	that drive and continues.  It can be intentionally  set to work
	with a specified number of drives, however.

========================================================================

QUICK SUMMARY OF OPTIONS:

B>SD $U4ADL		(etc.)

	A  -  All user areas allowed, usually 0-15, less on RCPM systems
	C  -  Clear screen (if activated for your CRT)
	D  -  All disks starting with 1st available (usually A:)
	F  -  Makes a file called DISKMENU.DIR automatically
	L  -  Library list option
	N  -  No pagination, keeps scrolling if more than one full page
	P  -  Printer option - lists to printer
	R  -  Reset disk (perhaps a new one installed)
	S  -  Shows system files (otherwise doesn't)
	V  -  Shows date, version number
	U8 -  Start with user 8
	4, 6, or 8 - Displays files in the optional 40, 64 or 80 column
	      format

    Using the $D option now automatically starts on the 1st available
    drive (usually A:) drive regardless what drive you were on when you
    started.  It then checks all available drives.  Similiarly, using
    the $A option will now always start with User 0, unless entered as
    $UnA - where n is a valid user number above zero.  You may now use
    ZCPR2 drive/user# syntax, i.e., A0:, B5:, ect.  and there is no need
    to specify a drive spec in the command line, i.e., SD A: $AD.  You
    You may now vary the number of file names per line on the fly.  You
    may also use (and store) the value used by SD for display at the lo-
    cation defined by MAXC by enabling the MAXCL equate (YES).	Then
    just have your signon or RBBS program assign the proper value for
    number of lines, (1-4) and store it at MAXC.  This means there is
    no more need to keep several versions of SD online.

Subject: PASS30 adds password access to any .COM file

PASS30, a new program to add password access to any .COM file is now
available on SIMTEL20.  Here's a list of the files, followed by a
brief description of how it works:

Filename			Type	 Bytes	 Sectors     CRC

Directory MICRO:<CPM.FILUTL>
PASS30.COM.1			COM	   512    4 =   4H  5A48H
PASS30.DOC.1			ASCII	  1334   11 =   BH  9B93H
PASS30.HEX.1			ASCII	  1271   10 =   AH  6139H

This is a novel little program that will install a password into any
COM file.  The best way to explain is to give an example:

  A>DIR                                   <- the two files are on the dsk
    PASS30  .COM  |  STAT    .COM
  A>STAT                                  <- the original file is run
  A: R/W 38k free
  A>PASS30 STAT.COM                       <- PASS30 is invoked
  Password? FREEDOM                       <- the PW is now set
  A>STAT                                  <- someone tries to run it
  Password? BARF                          <- oops, wrong pw, so warmboot
  A>
  A>STAT                                  <- let's try again
  Password? FREEDOM                       <- proper pw entered, so run
  A: R/W 38k free                            the program
  A>

DO NOT run PASS30 over a program twice! then you will need to enter
TWO passwords (it has no way of "clearing" the pw, so once it's set,
it's locked in there.)

Thanks for the morse offer -- but already reinvented the wheel.  Actually
convinced the faithful Toad (Morrow Decision I, and NO game ports lately!)
to both send and receive Morse, in BASIC and Assembler.  Hoo Haaaah!
Now porting (??) to a C64.  Got it to send, now figuring out the game ports
to interface to a standard key.  However it (the 3rd this week) just blew
up (garbaged screen) - lasted longer than the other two.  (Sigh....)

to Kaypro-10 owners who need the source code for the CBIOS.

Filename			Type	 Bytes	 Sectors     CRC

Directory MICRO:<CPM.KAYPRO>
KP10BIOS.DOC.1			ASCII	   666    6 =   6H  BA7AH

                     BIOS for the Kaypro 10
                     ======================

The accompanying file is the BIOS source for my Kaypro 10
with the ZCPR3 initialization.  This BIOS works on Kaypro
10's with CP/M version 2.2D, 2.2F, and 2.2G.  It has been
tested with all those versions.  There is a table of equates
in the beginning of the listing.  Set the one corresponding
to your CPM version to true and the other two to false and
you should be in business.

If you don't want the ZCPR3 buffer initialization, just set
the ZCPR3 equate to false and you have a "plain vanilla"
CPM system.

Subject: dBASE II v. 2.4 'feature'
Article-I.D.: lanl-a.12610

I believe that I have discovered a feature of dBASE II v. 2.4.
The report command has a new option 'WHILE' <exp>' that terminates the
report as soon as the while condition is not satisfied.  The feature is
that 'WHILE' does not work in combination with 'FOR <exp>'.  I thought
that I would be clever and fix up a way to terminate the report prematurely
by using the patch (I forgot where it comes from) that stores the most recent
keyboard character in a location (337 decimal) that does not get zeroed
by dBASE II.   Then I could set up the report something like:

REPORT FORM TEST FOR LASTNAME='D' WHILE PEEK(337)<>3 TO PRINT

Then, if I was unhappy with the report  I could quit with a CTL-C instead
of waiting for the whole thing to finish or hitting the reset button (not a
good practice if you have recently editted a file.)

Both the 'FOR' and the 'WHILE' options work OK by themselves, but not together
in either order.  
Maybe I ask too much of dBASE II.  Does anyone have a good idea about how 
to interrupt a report output without hitting reset???

Subject: ERAQ16 selective erase program available

ERAQ16 v1.6 - Selective erase program is now available on SIMTEL20.
ERAQ shows file names and separately asks confirmation on each, prior
to erasure.  This minimizes accidental erasures.  (If you still erase
a file you meant to keep you can easily restore it to normal by using
a program called "UNERA".  This assumes you have not overwritten any
part of it.  Every CP/M operator should have "UNERA.COM" for peace of
mind!  This program is patterned after the ERAQ function provided with
Digital Research's MP/M system.

Here is a list of the new files, followed by a short Modification &
Update List:

Filename			Type	 Bytes	 Sectors     CRC

Directory MICRO:<CPM.DIRUTL>
ERAQ16.ASM.1			ASCII	 12012   94 =  5EH  DF52H

ERAQ16.INF.1			ASCII	  2440   20 =  14H  5228H

04/06/84  Modified to display drive code with filename.
  v1.6			Jim Dreher

12/21/83  Increased capacity to more than 256 files.  Used to have 
  v1.5    problems with large directories because file counters were
          only eight bits wide - now 16.  Made the "no files specified"
	  error optional by conditional assembly.  Added "ASEG" directive
	  and eliminated colons on equate lables to allow assembly by
	  Macro-80.
	                    Tony Newman (WB7FCN)

01/10/83  Modified to eliminate warm reboot when finished.  Was most
	  annoying, for if not in 'A' drive rebooted both the current
  v1.4    drive and 'A' as well.  Reformatted, now assembles normally
	  with ASM or MAC.  Standardized tab stops, some were missing.
	  Included error message if no files specified for erasure.
					- Irv Hoff

04/16/82  Mask bit 7 for console output for memory-mapped video boards
which use the high bit for attribute info.

12/10/81  Added checks for $SYS and $RO attributes.

11/20/81  Added default to '*.*' if no input parameters.

11/08/81  Original program written by Thomas Hill.

Subject: Re: Suggestions for Deaf BBS Wanted

I would suggest using normal computer bulletin board software
and hardware with a BAUDOT/ASCII conversion unit between the
computer and the modem.

Some local amateur radio operators should be able to help you with
information about BAUDOT/ASCII conversion units.  Amateur radio
operators have been using the BAUDOT code (International Telegraph
code # 2) for years. Many of them now use microcomputers instead
of teletypewritters as BAUDOT terminals.

There are also a couple of commercial companies that sell
BAUDOT/ASCII conversion units.  I saw one several years ago
that used two conversion units BAUDOT/CW and CW/ASCII to do
BAUDOT/ASCII conversion.

Message-ID:  <840827231227.175341@RADC-MULTICS.ARPA>

     Last weekend, I downloaded MEX11.COM from CompuServe on the CP/M
SIG.  I also downloaded the MXO-HZ11.ASM and MXO-SM13.ASM overlays.
When I edited the overlays, assembled them and loaded them over MEX11
using MLOAD21.COM, running the program just got me a "+++ Null file name
+++" message.  Is there something in the documentation for MEX11 I
should know about?  I hesitated to download it from CompuServe since it
was 121K long!
     Any help is appreciated.  Perhaps all I need is the documentation.
If anyone might know when it will be on SIMTEL, I'd like to know about
it.

     I've always aborted a report with ESCAPE. Unless your have done

it dumps you back at the dot prompt. At that point a

. SET PRINT OFF 

is needed to turn off the printer, and unfortunately, any DO file

MEX111, the latest version of MEX, the popular modem program by

and MEX11.  Here is a list of the new files (note that some files
are available in both ASCII and SQUEEZED formats, as well as the
entire MEX111.LBR itself for those who can FTP ITS-binary files).

MLOAD21.HEX.1			ASCII	  6867   54 =  36H  2E67H
note MLOAD21 is the same as before but listed here for completeness

MX111UPD.DOC.1			ASCII	   670    6 =   6H  3A03H

Frank Wancho forwarded your message asking about how to submit files
to the CP/M archives at SIMTEL20.  There is presently no way to write
(i.e. "put") files to SIMTEL20 using the ANONYMOUS login with FTP.
However, if your host supports ANONYMOUS login with FTP and if you can
set the file attributes (if any) so that they can be accessed in that
manner, all you need to do is tell me where the files are and their
names.  I will retrieve them and then tell you where I have put them
on SIMTEL20 so you can announce them to Info-Cpm.

If your host does not allow ANONYMOUS ftp access, all is not lost.  We
do have an account at MIT-MC and you can put files there in the FJW;
directory and then send me a message with pointers to them.

I recently received my Rainbow 100+ and am looking for modem programs
that I can use with it.  Does anyone have any public domain modem
programs that run on a Rainbow?  Does anyone have any MEX overlays
that run on a Rainbow?  (They must be different, since the Z80 will
run MEX, but the 8088 has control of the serial ports).

I am in the process of adapting a modem program that I wrote before
to run on the Rainbow.  I would appreciate it if I did not have to
do this and could use an already existing program.  If not, does
anyone else need such a modem program?

I am looking a program that converts text to speech (text to allophone
strings).  Any pointers would be greatly appreciated.

Subject: UC crc questions
To: info-cpm@brl.ARPA

(This message was sent before but was garbled both by wordstar, the 
mailer, and my own fuzzy thinking.  It was re-written and I'll try
again.)

I was working with the various modes of the crc mode of uc (ver 1.2)
trying to determine the proper modes to use to check uploaded files
on our local unix machine.

However, I got rather confused because the character counts and crcks
did not match and the relationship is not clear.  This is what I did:

I took two small files, B.COM (a binary file) and a A.TXT (a straight 
7-bit ascii file) and uploaded with (to) umodem and uc from MEX10 
using both the -t (text) and -b (binary) options.  Then I ran uc's -c 
and -C crc checks.  Very few numbers matched.

file       upload            ls -l            uc crc's
name       method          char count  -c (text)   -C (binary)

A.TXT      append into ed     390      C6700080    6C4AFFFFF
A.TXT      umodem -rb         512      ADFB00080   C67FFFFF 
A.TXT      umodem -rt         390      C6700080    6C4AFFFFF
A.TXT      uc -rb             512      ADFB00080   C67FFFFF 
A.TXT      uc -rt             390      C6700080    6C4AFFFFF
                                                            
B.COM      append into ed     446      976F00080   E05FFFFFF
B.COM      umodem -rb        1920      BC1400080   2540FFFFF
B.COM      umodem -rt         620      EA6200080   6E01FFFFF
B.COM      uc -rb            1920      BC1400080   2540FFFFF
B.COM      uc -rt            1543      7B0100080   A441FFFFF

The A.TXT crc from CRCK44 was 0C67, BYTEFREQ reported 512 characters
The B.TXT crc from CRCK44 was 2540, BYTEFREQ reported 1920 characters

Leading zeros are apparently dropped in the uc crc output.  I
would like to understand why the various numbers don't match, which
method should I use for text and binary uploads, and how they 
should be checked with crc.

Bob, I can't answer your UC crck questions, Rick Conn would be best
for that.  However, I can offer an alternative means for checking
files uploaded to a Unix system.  Please get MICRO:<UNIX.CPM>CRCK2.C
and try it.  I find it quite useful and unambiguous.  Ben Goldfarb did
a super job of adding several new features which are detailed at the
beginning of the CRCK2.C file.

I read your message again and edited your chart to show the proper
method for uploading the A.TXT and B.COM files.  Remember that text
files stored under Unix do not have Carriage Returns, only Line Feeds
at the end of each line.  Also the trailing control-Z's from CP/M text
files are NOT stored on Unix.

file       upload            ls -l            uc crc's
name       method          char count  -c (text)   -C (binary)

A.TXT      umodem -rt         390      C6700080    6C4AFFFFF
A.TXT      uc -rt             390      C6700080    6C4AFFFFF
                                                            
B.COM      umodem -rb        1920      BC1400080   2540FFFFF
B.COM      uc -rb            1920      BC1400080   2540FFFFF

The A.TXT crc from CRCK44 was 0C67, BYTEFREQ reported 512 characters
The B.COM crc from CRCK44 was 2540, BYTEFREQ reported 1920 characters

Note that the .COM file matches exactly on byte count.  The .TXT
cannot, for the reasons outlined above.

Re:   WS2ROFF bug

The "bug" is WS2ROFF.COM fails to generate page commands.  It isn't
converting .pa commands to .bp commands. It should probably do the
same for ^L's in the file too.  Also .pn x commands should convert to
.bp x commands.

	The CRCs generated by UC match those generated by CRC (under
ZCPR2 and ZCPR3), Keith's CRCK, and CRC on SIMTEL20.  UC was written
on UNIX System V to run on System V only (there are many differences
between the System V and Berkeley UNIXes in their libraries), and I
don't support it under anything other than System V.  I question the
output you have been receiving since the values are 8 digits long,
where the values output by the -c or -C options of UC under System V
are only four digits long.  If you are running System V, clearly there
is a problem with the UC installed there.  If you are not running
System V, the answer is clear.  Keith's solution to use CRCK.C may be
best since it is generic (I think).

Subject: PHONE - an ascii file string searcher - available

Bernie Eiben has just released the CP/M-80 version of PHONE.  PHONE
allows You to search a "flat" ASCII-file for any string and prints out
the line containing the string and any line following the target-line,
which starts with "white-space". The original MSDOS-version was
written using LATTICE-C, the CPM-version was changed for AZTEC-C
[slight C-language differences plus changes in default-file searching
for both micro-systems and the DOC-file].

PHONE uses SOUNDEX-techniques to "catch" possible mis-spelling and
supports ? for wild-character match and * for any-string match. Aside
from a "easy going" telephone "memory" any other "string-based
reminders" can be build using any editor since PHONE allows to change
the text-file-name on the command-line.

Bernie says: "PHONE was originally written by Martin Minow and ...
(see DOC-file) - so they deserve the announcement credit."

The files are available on SIMTEL20 as:

Filename			Type	 Bytes	 Sectors     CRC

Directory MICRO:<CPM.TXTUTL>
PHONE.C.1			ASCII	 11252   88 =  58H  0340H
PHONE.COM.1			COM	 15872  124 =  7CH  38ADH
PHONE.DOC.1			ASCII	  2890   23 =  17H  D1F3H
PHONE.HEX.1			ASCII	 38647  302 = 12EH  3AF9H

The .LBR file is also available for those who want the whole package
and can FTP ITS-binary files:
PHONE.LBR.1			COM	 22272  174 =  AEH  7D05H

One of my 8" drives is a surplus SIEMENS and gives me
trouble intermittently.  After I use it for a while,
it acts as though it cannot find the correct track and
seeks forever between track 1 and the track it is looking for.

I seem to remember seeing an old message that this was a common
occurence with these drives.

Does anyone know what to do to fix it?

Unfortunately, Commodore BASIC programs, of which this one is no
exception, utilize control characters, both normal ascii ones and ones
with the high order bit set (ie. chr$(x) where x>127), and are thus
not amenable to storage and transfer as normal ascii files.  All of
the cursor positioning characters and reverse field characters are
missing from MICRO:<CPM.COMMODORE>XMODEM64.BAS.  Commodore BASIC
programs must be treated (especially by XMODEM programs themselves) as
"binary", not text, and are best transmitted as hex files.  Of course,
it is possible to write a C64 program which uses only the normal ascii
subset, but I haven't seen one (nontrivial) yet!

Subject: Little Board
In-reply-to: Msg of 30 Aug 1984  20:39-MDT from Mike Niswonger <CNISWONGER at SIMTEL20.ARPA>

Mike,

	I use the Ampro Little Board within an Ampro Bookshelf
Computer.  This computer consists of the little board, two 790K 5 1/4"
minifloppies, powersupply, and case and connectors.

	I have found the little board to be exceptionally reliable.
It has never glitched or provided any problems.  Physically, it is
quite small -- small enough to fit on the back of a 5 1/4" minifloppy
drive.  It includes a Z80 micro running at 4MHz, 64K RAM (dynamic, 8
bits), one Z80-DART (provides two serial ports, RS-232C, with the
normal complement of handshaking - DTR, CTS, etc - and one port can go
up to 38,400 baud while the other goes up to 9600 baud), one parallel
I/O port (bidirectional), one Z80-CTC counter-timer chip (only one
channel out of the four is free for general use - the other three are
used for clocking the DART and the disk controller), and one 179x
(1793, I think) floppy disk controller chip.

	The disks are quite fast.  I will be running some metrics on
them soon, but as a rough estimate I would say they rival my 8" DSSD
disks in speed.  The unit I use has two 96 TPI drives, giving 790K
storage per disk, and it can read and write several different 96 TPI
formats.  There is also a program which enables it to read (but not
write) 48 TPI - I understand that writing 48 TPI on a 96 TPI drive is
not physically possible.  There is an outgoing connector which can be
used to tag on two more drives (either 96 or 48 TPI, so you can obtain
48 TPI compatability), and I have heard that Ampro now has a
Winchester (10M) running off the external disk connector.  If you have
48 TPI compatability, there are about 20 different disk formats you
can read or write, such as Heath, IBM-PC (CPM-86), etc.  All must be
CP/M compatable.

	In the way of software, a scaled-down ZCPR3 comes with it.
Running on this is FRIENDLY (a VFILER/MENU/other utility), T/MAKER
III, and a number of machine-specific programs for configuring the
Ampro under software control.  Some PD software, like MDM740 and
source to the proper overlay, is also included (MDM740 is already
installed).  Echelon will sell you the standard ZCPR3 package, fully
installed for the Ampro, for $39.  The version of the Ampro Bookshelf
I have been describing (with two 790K minifloppies) runs for $1500.

	My main use for the Ampro is as a slave off of my main system.
I can redirect I/O so that the Ampro can record screen displays for me
with no overhead on the main system, and I am in the process of adding
a printer spooler and background batch processor to the Ampro.  I
occasionally use the Ampro in stand-alone mode, like for talks
(because it is very portable), but most of the time it is a slave.  At
790K, it offers a lot of spooling space and recording space.  Some day
I plan to experiment with distributed systems using the Ampro and my
main machine.

(The following was also sent to net.micro.cpm on Usenet.  My apologies if
you see it twice.)

I am running CP/M 2.2 on a TRS-80 with the OKIDATA modification (so that
"vanilla" CP/M code will execute unmodified).  At present I'm trying to
bring up a small-C compiler and it needs primitives for getchar() and
putchar().  Surely someone has solved this already.  What's the easiest
way to do this -- calls to the BIOS? -- to BDOS?  -- custom code? 
All solutions will be appreciated.  As usual, sufficient interest will
produce a summary to net.micro.cpm

The list of all known MDM7 modem program user overlays has recently
been updated and is now available on SIMTEL20 as:

Filename			Type	 Bytes	 Sectors     CRC

Directory MICRO:<CPM.MODEM7>
M7OVL-21.LST.1			ASCII	  5602   44 =  2CH  4B7EH

Please note that this is NOT a list of the files we have available
here at SIMTEL20.  We have some of them.  If you need one that is
listed in this file but not available from SIMTEL20, call one of the
RCPM systems listed at the end of the file.  If you find it necessary
to do this, please upload the new overlay to your host and send a note
to me advising how to get it with FTP.

I have a PD modem program for the Rainbow.  It is called 
modem712, came from an RCPM in Pikesvi;;e 
Maryland, and i cannot promise it works very well.  the first version i got
was very buggy.  this one says it is feeling better.

i am a novice here--i am not sure how to send info directly to
hplabs!hao!seismo!cmcl2!lanl-a (is that the address?).  somebody please
advise me...

To: info-cpm@AMSAA.ARPA


...which brings me to my own problems.

Has anyone got a terminal emulator for an Osborne the is compatible with
EMACS @CMU (or anywhere else, i guess).  i have several PD programs, and they
seem to pass control chars and escape sequences
through alright.  But there is no TERMINAL TELEVIDEO920 type here (i think
that is what the O tries to be).  I have tried tv912, and others, but with no luck.

(oh yeah, its TOPS-20)

What might be the worst problem is that the <delete>, ascii 127, appears on the
screen as a blot.

Anyway, i have all the relevant codes handy for anyone who might
help.

Subject: PLOT33 Package available

PLOT33 has been contributed to the public domain collection on
SIMTEL20 by Thomas E. Speer at AFIT.  This system will do high
resolution graphics on a variety of dot matrix printers, and is being
used at the Air Force Institute of Technology for purposes ranging
from data plotting to VLSI design check points.

The package consists of the user's guide documentation for the entire
system, the assembly language source for the dot matrix driver, Turbo
Pascal, FORTRAN-80, and MBASIC plot packages, and sample programs.  A
C library is being debugged.

Printers supported include the Epson MX-80 etc., CItoh Prowriter,
Okidata 92, NEC, Gemini-10, Apple Dot Matrix, and IDS printers.

PLOT33 lets you treat your printer as if it were a plotter capable of
true vector graphics.  Your application program "plots" by writing
simple plot commands to a disk file.  This file is the key to the
whole system because it makes the application program independent of
the plotting device and vice versa.  It also makes it possible to plot
pictures that were created on different computers, or to plot the same
picture on different types of hardware, such as CRTs and printers.

Future drivers are being planned for creating and interpreting the
vector command file on mainframe computers using CALCOMP or Tektronix
plotters and terminals.
