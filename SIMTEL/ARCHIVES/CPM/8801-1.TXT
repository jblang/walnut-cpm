There is a version for the Kaypro on the Columbia System.  I have it in
a special use directory.  Don't know if it will run on your particular
Kaypro, but will provide it to you if you want it.

This original message was obviously not totally clear, particularly
to those not familiar with the Apple/Applicard.
 
I should, therefore, make it clear that the Applicard is running
as a Z80 co-processor in the Apple.  The modem is connected into
the Apple part of the system and a Driver in the Apple directly
handles the interface with the modem (a Super Serial Card).  In
this Driver, which is entered following an Apple IRQ interrupt
when a modem character arrives, there is a 4K buffer.  This
buffer is of a sufficient size (by a long way) that it should be
unnecessary to use x-on/x-off protocol.

The Ramdisk, which I use for the capture file, is the PCPI (2 in
fact) Ramdisk which plugs directly onto the Applicard.  It,
therefore, has nothing to do with the Apple bus and is not
controlled in the same way as drives which are on the Apple bus.
I am aware that Apple interrupts are a problem when Apple 5 1/4
drives and standard drive controller are used, but they are not
involved in this problem.
 
The lost character problem, when the capture buffer is flushed to
the disk file, occurs at 1200 baud, not just at the higher baud
rates that I am really interested in.

The following are some of the responses that I have received and
some of my comments relating to them:

          Bob - What system are you using ?  Regarding
          the use of x-on/x-off, perhaps this is
          necessary with your system, though another
          MEX user local to me has done a test with a
          PMC 101 Micromate and hard disk, with STAT
          XON and STAT XOFF both OFF and has observed
          no character loss.  I had thought that
          setting STAT QUEUE ON would ensure that there
          was no character loss during the disk write,
          but tests that I have done do not confirm
          this.  I am not sure how often the modem
          status is being checked during the disk write
          operation.  In the Driver which I have on the
          Apple side of the system, I do detect when
          the (4K) buffer is filling up and
          automatically send out a ^S.  When MEX has
          reduced the backlog in the buffer a ^Q is
          automatically sent to restart the remote.
          However, this only seems to be necessary for
          my system at 9600 baud.  At 1200 baud the
          buffer never seems to be filled.  Despite
          this, I do lose 2 characters during the disk
          write.

          Rick - As I have noted above the disk I am
          using for the capture file is the PCPI add-on
          Ramdisk.  This has no connection with the
          Apple interrupts.  Also, as noted, I am
          seeing this character loss at 1200 baud
          during the disk write.  The original
          character loss problem, which started all
          this off for me was the loss that occurs at
          the begining of each line (this is nothing to
          do with capture buffers) at 1200 or 2400 baud
          and higher (depending on whether you are
          using a ][+ or ][e and which 80-col card).
          This loss is a result of the time taken by
          the 80-col card to scroll, which required re-
          writing the whole screen, whenever there is
          a CR and you are at the bottom of the screen.
          I think that it is also a result of the
          Apple/Applicard interface protocol, though I
          have not totally sorted this out yet.  I am
          speculating that even with the modem port
          QUEUE ON, character loss occurs because the
          burst of characters which comes out of the
          queue once the disk write is complete is also
          too fast (faster than the normal 1200 baud
          character arrival rate) for the 80-col system
          to handle.  In some way this may be linked to
          getting the characters into the capture file.
          This explanation may be nonsense, but it is
          the best that I can come up with at the
          moment.  My lack of understanding of what the
          modem port queue is doing, and when it does
          it, is a limitation here.  The above comments
          on character loss apply to MEX running with
          Apple interrupts off and, therefore, no
          buffering in the Apple Driver.

          Rick - You are right, but I am not sure with
          STAT QUEUE ON, how often the modem is checked
          for new characters.  In any case, in my
          arrangement the buffer in the Apple should
          cope with any wait while the disk is written.
          In fact my MEX overlay does not actually
          check the modem status (for new characters),
          it check for a difference in the 4K buffer
          input and output pointers.

          Mike - As noted above, I think that my
          comments regarding the buffer in the Apple
          answer your item 1.  Item 2 - All the hosts
          involved support flow control.  Item 3 - My
          friend is not using a RAM disk and he is not
          using interrupt driven MEX I/O.

          Ted - As noted above the Apple disks are not
          involved.  The PCPI Ramdisk has no influence
          on the Apple interrupts.

          Bridger - As you will have noted above, the
          arriving bytes are buffered before they reach
          MEX and this buffer does exercise automatic
          flow control.  However, despite this, I am
          losing characters when the disk is written.

          As noted, I am using a Ramdisk, operating
          directly in the Z80 environment.  The CPU
          clock rate is 6 MHz at the moment (it can be
          increased to 10MHz).

          I have implemented interrupts for both
          receive and transmit (on a 6551 ACIA) in the
          Apple modem-port Driver.  In fact I know that
          the characters are coming from the modem into
          the 4K Apple buffer as I separately send them
          to the 80-col display directly from the
          Apple (the display characters do not pass
          through MEX).  There is no character loss on
          the screen under this arrangement, only from
          the capture file.  (In case there is some
          confusion here, there are two interrupt
          modes.  In one, characters do not go via MEX
          to the screen in the other they do.  The
          first scheme will work at 9600 baud, the
          second will not.  I have included the latter
          to allow operation at lower baud rates and to
          retain the possibility of using the MEX
          terminal emulation modules).

          Jim - I think that I have covered most of
          your points above.  I suspect that the 'back-
          up' buffer that you are referrring to is the
          modem port queue (defined by PQSIZE in
          MEXPAT).  With no interrupts on (in the
          Apple) the character loss occurs with STAT
          QUEUE ON or OFF.  MEX1.65 is also known as
          MEXPLUS of which it is the latest major
          revision.  It has many features which do not
          exist in the PD MEX1.14.  The features are
          described in the file MEX16SUM.WQ which is
          available by FTP from SIMTEL20 in
          PD1:<CPM.MEX>.  There is also a file on GEnie
          called MEX16.AZN which provides a
          description.
____________________________________

Well, I have found this exchange of information quite useful and
thought provoking.  I am now beginning to draw some tentative
conclusions.  I think that I have been observing two different
loss mechanisms here.  With recent 1200 baud tests that I have
done with the earlier MXH-AP55.ASM overlay and RINGBUF.A65 Apple
Driver, I have found that I get character loss with and without
STAT QUEUE ON and OFF (Note: this Driver will not run at 9600
baud, this is why I have been developing a new one!).  I am not
sure why the QUEUE is not preventing this loss, but I think it is
to do with the Apple/Applicard interface and the time taken to
write characters to the screen.  With interrupts ON, this earlier
version with its 256 byte buffer, does prevent character loss in
the capture file.  With my revised Driver I always lose 2
characters at the time the capture buffer is written to disk (the
loss in the non-interrupt mode referred to above is always
several more characters than this).  I think, therefore, that I
still have a bug to sort out in the Driver.  (I should also point
out that I cannot in the end use the modem port QUEUE as, at 9600
baud, the capture process gets so far behind that the queue is
eventually overwritten).
 
Thank you again for all of the responses.  I still have some work
to do!

        I'm a Apple CP/M 2.2 user, my configuration consists of an
Apple ][+ with a Z80 Softcard, and I'm a fan of Turbo Pascal 2.0 .
        My problem is how eliminating the "include error message (Y/N)"
when Turbo Pascal is being executed and second how preventing Turbo
Pascal making a BAK (backup) file ? Can this be done with some patches
with DDT ?
        I've got the same problem with Wordstar 3.01P (eliminating BAK).

	I sent out a previous query, maybe it didn't make it.
My sis has a Visual 1050 which is supposed to be somewhat compatible
to the Kaypro II and DEC Rainbo. 
	I downloaded a HEX KERMIT file which runs until the  connect
command is called which crashes the machine.
	Is this an incompatiblity due to port assignment, or is the
file I got corrupted?
	I haven't even figured out what processor (8080 I think)
this machine runs. 
	Any help out there for this machine?

any reasonable number of requests I'll mail it, otherwise post it.
Hopefully no one will want it at all...

There was a patch sent around years ago to eliminate the "Include error
messages" prompt.  Sorry, I didn't save it.

Turbo and WordStar do not create .BAK files, so it's *really* tough to get
them not to do so.  In both of these products, the .BAK file is the
previous version of the file you're working on.  When you edit a file with
Turbo, the entire file is pulled into memory.  When you write it out Turbo
renames the old .PAS file to be .BAK.  WordStar does things a little
differently:  As you edit a file, pieces of it are shuffled between the
workspace in memory and a temporary file named <filename>.$$$.  When you
finishe editing, WordStar writes everything out to a new file, deletes the
temporary file, and renames the old file to be .BAK.

I'd guess that you must never have had a system crash while editing with
either Turbo or WordStar, or made a really *bad* mistake in editing that
you wish you could fix back easily.  If you had, you'd be *glad* to have
the backup files around!  I had an Apple ][+ with a SoftCard for a couple
of years, and I have an Apple //e with a PCPI Applicard now; and even with
the tiny 128Kbyte capacity of Apple floppies, it's worth the safety.

Subject: Help with a Bigboard I
Message-Id: <520@cvedc.UUCP>
Sender: info-cpm-request@simtel20.arpa
To: info-cpm@simtel20.arpa

I am attempting to resurect my Bigboard I which has been setting in my back room
for the last two years. It was running when I put it away, but it has a problem
now. All of my power supplys are up and correct and all options are installed.

When the board is powered on the screen clears, then fills with an 
alternating pattern of :'s and 0's, which then blinks at the refresh rate. This
shows me that my video section is working but seems to indicate that PFM is not
being loaded. I checked (with a logic probe, I don't have access to a scope)
and I have all clock signals.  I have removed and reinstalled all the chips in
an attempt to check for oxidation, but no go. It worked when I put it away.

Anybody have any suggestions??

Subject: PCPI softcard/MEX character loss

I forget all my sources but when I "switched to MEX" I set out to
resolve your same problem myself.  Without reviewing all of my tests, my
results were as follows.  I talked to people at PCPI and Laing
Electronics (who sell and repair PCPI stuff) who both said it was tied
to the video card in use; checking other sources the consensus was that
the Ultraterm card worked best and solved it through like 9600 bps.  I
only half bought this story, becuase the same serial card and video
hardware under "native" 6502 modes like Apple DOS or PASCAL seemed to
work pretty well - better than on the PCPI anyway. I wrote a little
FORTH dumb terminal program in 1K in native mode and it didn't but a
couple here and there.  ASCII Express under DOS 3.3 never dropped
anything - but it does interrupt I/O to RAM and displays it later. So I
decided the key on the Apple was buffering the characters as they come
in BEFORE displaying them, since the display is so miserably slow.  Then
Apple came out with the "enhanced //e" with completely re-written
80-column firmware, and lo and behold my little 1K FORTH glass TTY
worked fine.  I later got a VT-100 emulator called DCOM v3.3 that works
fine doing ANSI escape sequences at 2400 baud using the buffered
technique WITHOUT interrupts. So on my "to do" list is a task to write a
6502-resident driver that buffers character I/O that the PCPI side can
get characters from over the comparatively slow parallel CPU port that
uses Apple's 6502 to do all I/O anyway. By the same token, the Ultraterm
card is supposed to fix this too. 

So here was my solution: since I wanted VT-100 or at least VT-52
emulation and MEX didn't fit that bill I really only needed a usable
glass TTY to fire up XMODEM and do directories and so forth.  My
workaround was to tell the host operating system to add a bunch of fill
characters and that works fine for what I wanted out of it.  Under
VAX/VMS I did a "$ SET TERM/LA36/CRFILL=9/LFFILL=9" ...note that since
v4.0 of VMS "=9" is "class nine" and not "nine characters".  Previously
(v3.n) I think I used (3) CR fills and (7) LF fills or vice-versa. If
you use VMS and think you're having flow control problems VAXen don't
normally have flow-control on in both directions - do a "$ SET
TERM/HOSTSYNC/TTSYNC" to fix that. When I need real terminal emulation,
I go back to native Apple modes, and that wins through 2400 baud on an
"enhanced //e." 

Hope that helps...

Has anybody 1) seen KERMIT for the PCPI, 2) seen a MEX overlay for a DEC
"Scholar" or DF03 modem ?

   Thanks to all who replied to my request for information on the new
gateway to BITNET.  It is amazing how many responses I got, probably because
the question was easy to answer.  I know that I usually answer easy
questions immediately.  The hard ones tend to sit around in my REQUESTS file
while I cogitate on the appropriate answer.
 
   I had seen the warnings that WISCVM was going away, but I never saw a
message about a replacement gateway.  With nothing else to substitute, I
continued to use WISCVM until it refused to accept the messages.  Apparently
there were a number of people at MIT Lincoln Lab who had been asking the
local administrator for the gateway address.  All of you who answered have
made several people happy!

I spoke to folks at Micropro just before Christmas and asked them
if they had any estimate of the size of the CP/M market.  They said
they didn't, but I received a letter this past week from a Marketing 
Communications Manager at Micropro, and she stated that between August and 
November 1986 Micropro sold 17,000 upgrades to CP/M Wordstar.

Estimates of the number of CP/M machines varies from one and a half to
two million.  Some of these are out of service, but others have been 
passed on.  Any one out there have a suggestion as to how we might 
characterize the size of the CP/M software market?

A friend recently purchased a AMSTRAD PCW 8256 "word processor." Upon
investigation, I discovered that this is a CPM + system which 
automatically starts up the word processor, but also comes with 
"Mallard" BASIC, "DR LOGO" and various utilities, including a macro
assembler. Of course there is no documentation for most of this...
Can anyone point me in the direction of documentation, or other goodies
which might be available? Also, a pinout of the expansion port would be
nice...

Thanks!

Yes - Declining.  Seriously though - I would have thought the total
number of machines was much greater. Especiallly if you include all
those that can run CP/M as a sideline - TRS80's for example - over
2 million of those alone. Apple softcards and I suppose someone
somewhere is running CP/M on a PC.

This CPM box was introduced in England about two years ago, and is one of
the most common machines in use over there, especially by writers and
other computerphobes.  It is a great value, achieving low cost by using the
nowadays dirt-cheap Z80, together with remaindered 3" (sic) disk drives and 
a bundled printer which uses the very same Z80 for processing. I may buy one
myself.

In England there are several magazines and scads of books devoted to this
machine; your friend's best bet is to go there :-), or to find a large
bookstore here that carries English computer magazines (not impossible; the
major chains' large Chicago stores do, for example).

Because of this machine, CPM is flourishing in Europe.

Does anyone know where I can get some files (overlays, read files)

I have heard of the files: PCPMEX10.LBR, PCPFAST.MZX

These files are supposedly on Royal Oak BBS, which is the biggest and only
CPM board I really know of. However Royal Oak seems to be down and has for
literally several weeks now. The number I have for it is 313-759-6569.

Can anyone shed some light on Royal Oak and/or tell me where I can get these
files (or better ones) for PCP and MEX?

Hello All -

     I figure hundreds of people have already run into this little
problem.. and it has already been solved.

     I am trying to mate BYE339 (yes, I know it's been superseded..
but 502 wasn't out when I started this) with RBBS 4.102 .  And things
aren't going well.  There is some interaction between the two which is
corrupting memory and making my life miserable.

     Surely this has been done before.. how to debug an RSX after it's
been installed?  Is there some way to get SID or Z8E to accept an
offset to a symbolic label so I can reach in and see which program is
guilty of memory bashing?

     I'm using BDS-C v 1.50a for the RBBS compile.

Most debuggers use the bdos (rather than the bios) for terminal
input/output, so the first thing you have to do is avoid re-entering
the bdos when you are tracing/trapping.

You might try this approach under the debugger:

5:	jmp rsx_entry

100:
program:
	...
xx:	call 5		;bdos call at routine causing trouble
	...

Change the 'call 5' to 'call rsx_entry'.
Set breakpoints at 0000, the program's exit routine, and xx.
Set up command line and execute from 100.  When you hit
the xx trap, set other breakpoints in the rsx at important
spots, then single-step into the rsx to watch things.

You can get symbols for the rsx by assembling it once with origin ==
rsx_entry and loading that symbol file under the debugger.  Some
debuggers will cummulate symbols from several files, so you can also
load symbols from the transient program if you have them.

If you do much debugging, you may want to patch the debugger to
use bios i/o.

I think, Ted, that this is your best bet (at least until sombody comes out
with a package that *every* CP/M user will want :-). It's clear that the
CP/M market is larger then 17000, but by how much I wouldn't know.

One can't even assume there are only 17k WordStar users out there. There are
many who, like me, never mailed in the licenses for their old WordStars and 
thus wouldn't have learned about 4.0 (I registered only to get the upgrade).

I know 6 CP/M systems (mine, my mother's, father's, two friends', and my 
boss's [for sale]), but only two of us (my father and I) have bought W*4.0.
One friend doesn't use (or like, Jon?) WordStar, and the other doesn't know 
(yet) about the upgrade.  Based on my experience we could say there are about 
50000 systems active. I don't think that's a very accurate estimate, maybe not
even to order of magnitude. 

I'm not sure we'd do much better if we each listed all the systems we know
(checking to avoid overlaps), and all the upgrades we know. (I would list 
only 5 known machines, because one friend is also on the net, but I would
list two upgrades.)

Message-Id: <4516@watdragon.waterloo.edu>
Sender: info-cpm-request@simtel20.arpa
To: info-cpm@simtel20.arpa

The distributed versions of Z80DOS (both version 1.0 and 1.1) have a slight 
problem when a read or write error occurs.  When a disk error occurs, your
machine will most likely crash (if you're lucky) but in some instances it 
will continue to run, but with unpredictable results.  An examination of the
code within Z80DOS reveals a rather serious bug within the error recovery/
reporting routine.  As can be seen from the code in example 1 (taken from the
Z80DDISK.Z80 file), the HL register pair is loaded with the contents of the 
address specified by the RDERR (or WRTERR) label.  Later, in the error recovery
routine, execution is passed to the address contained in the HL register
pair.  This clearly does not work as it has the result of performing a double
indirect jump whereas what was really intended was a single indirect jump.
To fix the problem, you must modify the code to read as in example 2.  It
would be appreciated if this information could be passed on to the author so
that it may be included in any future releases.

Subject: Use of WordStar Upgrades to Size CP/M Market

	Some have called WordStar "everybody's second favorite editor"

	most of the die-hard CP/Mers I know say they wouldn't give up
	good money for any version of it (at a local users group it's

	When the Simtel20 CP/M archives were created it'd be interesting

Hello!
Does anybody out there, in the netland, have any kind of
information how well different data transfering programs
does its job. I want to know how many bytes per second
each program transfers, in either direction, and what
buadrate gave the numbers. This should be counted for raw,
8-bit binary data. Some possible programs are KERMIT,
XMODEM, UUCP, SAFT and so on.
Thanks in advance.

Royal Oak is still up.  But there seems to be a system change over there.  
I'm wondering if there is going to be a new PCPIMPxx.COM program since PC 
Pursuit has a new set of mneumonics (sp?) codes.  I'm just about lost 
without a good pcp dialer.

Subject:  Infocom Games

Customising and Buying Infocom(tm) games

Recently Gar Nelson contributed a note (ZORKNOTE.TZT) which contained the
details of how to customise the screen display for ZORK etc. I can confirm that
he was correct in every detail. My confirmation comes from Infocom itself. In
days gone by Infocom used to ship CP/M games wtih the source of a program to
patch the COM file with the terminal control codes. I have used this successfull
on all their games - even the ones shipped without such files.

He also notes that Infocom have dropped their CP/M support. I don't know if that
is also true in the U.K. BUT I can purchase Infocom games over here that don't
exist in CP/M form according to the Infocom sales literature which comes with
their games. e.g. Leather Goddesses, Suspect, Stationfall, etc. This appears to
be due to the success of Amstrad Z80 computers in the UK. I have to buy the
games on 3" disks (yes three.zero) inch disks. It is then necessary to have the
media converted - either commercially or buy hooking up an Amstrad and my
machine and using good old Kermit!

I believe almost all Infocom games are available in the UK for the Amstrad. The
exception which I know of are: the two IBM PC specific games, and possibly
Plundered Hearts and Bureaucracy. Trinity and A Mind Forever ... are supposed
to be available, but I have not tried to get them, so I cannot comment. Two of
their newest releases (over here) - Lurking Horror and Stationfall are definitel
available.  The prices are higher than the $14.95 mentioned by Gar however -
we have prices of some 26 pounds = $47 (approx).

Subject: Versafloppy II Question


Can anyone out there help me with a question about a Versafloppy II FDC
made by S.D. Systems, Dallas, Tx.???  I'm running an old S-100 system
with this controller, and a generic CP/M (not S.D.'s version).  It was
OK running 8" SSSD, but got very slow when I switched over to 5 1/4".
I think that the problem is the sector slew.  No slew was slow, a slew
of 5 is worse!!  Does anybody know the magic number for this hardware??
I'm using a PD version of a DD cbios.  S.D. originally supplied Versa-
floppy II software (in ROM) that used a 128 b sector.  They later went
to 256 b sectors.  Did the slew used in the S.D. version of CP/M change
with the change in sector size??  ANY help/comments will be appreciated

  Re: CP/M on IBM

First, the information that you wanted is:
 
  Product Name:  RUN/CPM - COPROCESSOR BOARD FOR IBM and COMPATIBLES
  Company:       Micro Interfaces
                 16359 N.W. 57th Ave.
                 Hialeah, FL 33014
    Phone:       (305) 623-9262
                 1-800-637-7226
                 Telex 510600480 MICRO INTER CO
     Cost:       $199 (single unit)
                 $175 (group buy - 3 or more)
 
The RUN/CPM coprocessor is contained on a single board that is
mounted in one of your available slots .... I mounted it in a
IBM AT close compatible (CompuADD STANDARD 286).  I'm running my
system completely populated with 1-meg ram on the motherboard,
4-megs of Intel expanded memory (Above Board 286 with piggyback),
2400 baud internal modem, Vega Deluxe EGA with a NEC Multisysnc,
MicroSoft Bus Mouse... when you throw in a multi-purpose I/O card,
I have all of the slots populated.  I also have a Miniscribe 42
meg (28ms) harddrive and the whole system is tied together with a
Phoenix BIOS.  My system runs at 8mHz with 0 wait state. It yields
a Norton SI of 9.0.
 
The only reason I took the trouble to mention all of this detail
was to validate the complexity of the hardware when I say that
I've had no trouble with the RUN/CPM board in this environment.
 
The coprocessor contains 64K of it's own RAM and runs on a Zilog
Z80B at 4 mHz.  The board was simple to install and setup.
Simply run the Install program and this will put the interface
file into you Config.sys file. When invoked, a program is loaded
that contains a modified CPM 2.2  that will permit extensive
interaction between DOS and CPM.  The board runs most application
type software and at times will surprise you by running some
MSDOS versions also.  In order to differentiate between the CPM
and COM files, when RUN/CPM is loaded ... you have to rename the
'COM' extent to "CPM', these permits the CPM and MSDOS to
gracefully reside on the same harddisk.  It will support named
directories (only one partition), and uses the DOS command
structure for I/O (ie, PIP, D (sorted directory), etc will not
work).  However, Dave Rand's NSWEEP for MSDOS works great, and
any command that is supported by the DOS I/O.  For example,
SDIR/P <CR> is a DOS program for obtaining a 'Paused' sorted
directory .,.. works great.  Use COPY instead of PIP.
 
We've been using it about a year now, with our main applications
supporting our small mail order business ... originally begun
with the Kaypro II.  We use it for all of our accounting
(Starr - Accounting Partner), MicroSoft's CPM version of
Multiplan, and Wordstar 3.3,  I can use many of the utilities
from the CPM world also, including NULU, LU, CUNCH.UNCRUNCH, etc.
Our Club treasurer, Bob Sage, has also used one very successfully
with MicroSoft's Starr database. He is using an IBM AT.  I
presume that it would operate equally well with a PC/XT 8088.
 
There is also a nifty RAM resident program that will allow you to
configure on the fly.  First of all, you can set either (or both)
disk drive to format, read, and write CPM (115 disk formats are
supported) .... It supports the 96TPI 1.2 meg hi-capacity drives
as well as the standard 360K, 48 TPI drives.
 
      Here's a list of the things you can do on the fly...
 
      o Setup CP/M terminal emulation .... 96 terminals
        supported.
      o Setup CP/M disk emulation ... 115 formats supported.
      o Permits to you to assign logical drives - supports,
        A - P.
      o Permits the use of ramdisks.
      o Supports assigned (by you) I/O redirection.
      o Set colors (if you have color monitor.)
      o Sets Hot Key selection.
      o Key-board input translation (permits macros on function
        keys.)
      o Supports video mode selection (columns and rows, etc)
 
We have had no trouble reading our Kaypro II or Kaypro 484 disks.
However to be on the safe side, we will only write to disks that
have been formated on the Kaypros.  We have, however, successfully
formatted a disk from the 1.2 meg and 360K drives and transferred
the data.
                                Barney


Additional notes from Keith Petersen:

On Monday, January 11, 1987, Micro Interfaces was contacted by telephone
for updated information.  Several improvements have been made since
Barney purchased his board.  The Z80 board has not been sold since October
1987.  They now use a HD64180 (Z80 upward-compatible) chip in two versions
of the board: 6 MHz $275, and 10 MHz $499.  Group discounts are available.
Decmation makes the Micro Interfaces board.

The list of local users of the RUN/CPM board is not limited to IBM AT
owners.  There is at least one user who has an IBM XT.  He gave a
demonstration and talk on it at the CP/M club about six months ago.

Unfortunately, Bytes/Second would only be applicable for the specific
hardware/firmware combination being tested.  There is such a
difference between disk controllers (DMA vs CPU, clock speeds, etc.)
disk drives, the BDOS and BIOS being run, etc.  That two machines of
supposedly the same configuration can be quite different.  So, what
your looking for is the comparisons for the different programs done on
the SAME MACHINE, preferably near in time.  This can best be expressed
as in index number, with perhaps PIP being arbitrarily set to the
index of 100.  Then, each program would have to be tested against PIP
on the same hardware/software configuration.  Tests done on two
different machines would almost be worthless.  Also, the same program
may behave differently depending upon the hardware, so if your
particular setup has, for example, a DMA disk controller, you may be
better off with a program that takes advantage of the controller, even
if the index number is higher than a different program that doesn't.

In other words, this is a VERY subjective test.

     monitor
     3 8-inch floppy drives
     power supplies
     documentation for the above

     100 or so 8-inch floppy diskettes

The system has been cobbled together from separate components, and does
not include any sort of housing or chassis.  Two of the floppy drives
were scavenged from an old Intel development system; I still have the
chassis and power supply.  The system works fine - I just don't need
it now that I have a Mac SE.

I'd like to get $250+shipping for all of the above, but am willing to

   I beg to differ with you.  At 9600 baud you send at a rate of about 10
bits per character or a character about once a millisecond.  Almost any
computer on the market can send at that rate so I suspect the clock rate on
the computer would have little to do with it.

   The following things affect performance in my opinion:

   1. The amount of overhead in the protocol.

   2. In certain protocols the distance between the sending and receiving
computers.  If the protocol has a "send-ahead" feature then this is not a
consideration but if each message has to be "ACKED" before the next is sent
then the turn-around time if you are going through a satellite link is quite
a large delay.

   3. The error rate on the line may affect you.  There are three types of
protocols. Those with large messages (which have a low overhead but are very
susceptible to line noise), those with small messages (which have a high
overhead but are not as susceptible to line noise) and a few protocols which
adapt their message size according to the number of retransmissions which
are required. Obviously the latter is the most efficient but it is also the
most complex.

   4. How much overhead is spent in the disk logic.  At one extreme you can
have the disks on both ends reading or writing single CPM sectors of 128
bytes in a non-DMA world.  Thus you must delay on both the sending and
receiving end for the disk.  This delay is significant and may result in
the overall time doubling or tripling.  On the other extreme is a hard disk
with DMA and very large buffers so any disk activity is rare.  There may be
literally no overhead at all in this type of environment.

   The bottom line is that the software is responsible for most of the delays
in the transmission.  I have written transmission programs which buffer 16K
inputs from a floppy disk (without a DMA) and write 16K outputs to the floppy
disk. They use very large messages and have few overhead characters in the
message.  When running "back-to-back" to transfer data from one computer to
another I have run at 19200 and can move the data at better than a 95 per
cent efficiency.  Mind you because of the "back-to-back" situation there were
very few "hits" on the line and the protocol was not very clever when "hits"
occurred but the nature of a "back-to-back" situation is that the line tends
to be error-free. Also since many of my files were less than 16K in length
the transmission tended to be "memory-to-memory" with only the original read
and the final write taking up any disk time.

   It would be my educated guess that the same transmission program would
run at about the same speed on almost any computer on the market.

To:  fisher@CICGE.RPI.EDU



First, some background on the V1050.  It contains a Z80 uP
running CPM3.0 (banked).  It will *NOT* run software that does
not follow the CPM BDOS calls or uses non-ASCII screen/console
codes.   This means the Kaypro and the DEC as they use system
dependent AUX: (that is, RS232C port) accesses.  The V1050 is
touted as being VT-52 compatible; I have had problems with it.
The best rule of thumb is to use programs that only make 'legal'
BDOS calls.  This is not very limiting, except in communications
software or in graphics software.  Otherwise, one is asking for
headaches.

To address your question about Kermit, Columbia University
has just about every Kermit implementation ever written.  They
are available over BITNET from KERMSRV@CUVMA.BITNET.  You want
the generic CPM3 version.  I think it is called CP4CP3.HEX
and then you can assemble it.  (By the way, since it only
uses legal BDOS calls, it is only reliable up to 1200 baud)
Alternatively, if you will tell me how and where, I will be
happy to send you my copy of CPM3 kermit, either via
email or USnail, or probably both channels
would be better.  My track record with internet file
transfers isn't so hot.  Oh, also, KERMSRV has both
'C' source code and assembler source for most of the
Kermit implementations listed, if one wanted to adapt
or improve on the generic version.  All they ask is that
you upload the new, improved version to them.  (Lots of
V1050 owners would be grateful for accelerated baud rates.
Hint, hint..)

Mention should be made that versions of YAM and MEX that are adapted
for the V1050 are available for a nominal charge ($5 I think,
but don't quote me)from the V1050 users group.  If you're
interested, I will look up the address, or it may be available
over GEnie's V1050 conference.

Good luck.  Let me know if you get this, because, as I said,
my internet communications skills are less than perfect.
Unless I hear from you in a couple of weeks, I will post
this to CPM-INFO.

2.  Would someone from any Washington area Osbo users groups either

3.  Would anybody send them any hints, books, etc. that you think

I wonder if any of you folks can help me out.....

I am using MEX114 with the MDM740 overlay for the HP125. It transfers files
fine, and works in terminal mode fine. The prblem is that whenever I try
a SENDOUT command, the computer freezes. I have tried setting WECHO off
and TRIGGER "" to no avail. It doesn't even seem to send the chars to
the modem. I hope to get a line monitor soon to confirm that. I assume
that the same routines for sending chars to the modem in terminal mode
are used as during a SENDOUT? Does anyone have any ideas or hints? I have to
do a hard reset on the system to recover from this nasty, and unfortunately
it limits my use of the powerful READ file feature.

I have a run-off type print formatting program that I could distribute,
if it would be of use to anyone.  It's designed to print on the Epson
MX-80 or FX-80, and possibly more recent models (for all I know).  It
runs under cpm 2.2, and a friend of mine runs it with an Apple cpm+
card.  I don't know how portable it is in general.  It has 175 formatting
commands, and comes with 70 proportional fonts and 168K of user documents.

The .com file for the program is only 18K, but with documents, fonts,
and sources it comes to over a megabyte, so I guess it's too large to
post to this group.  And I don't think my uucp neighbors would be happy
if I mailed many copies.  So, is anybody interested in the thing, and
if so, where can I email it to make it available (I'd rather not mail
disks)?  Is there a way to get it into the Simtel20 archive?  It would
be nice if some interested person would try making the source, to check
that I didn't slip up in putting together the distribution.  It's in
8080 assembly language written for the Microsoft m80 assembler, and
some ancillary programs are in C of the BDS variety.

I await expressions of interest and advice about how to distribute.

Does anyone out there have a list of current bulletin boards that allow you
to download public domain CP/M programs? The SIMTEL archives are not
available at this site. I also tried to send mail to LISTSERV@CICGE.RPI.EDU,
but never received any response (I assume my mailer's From: line has an
unacceptable format). Next I tried a few bulletin boards on my CP/M computer
at home. The list of CP/M bulletin boards that I have is about 2 years old,
and the numbers I called this weekend (about 10 different places around the
country) are no longer in service.

			   Attn. Keith Peterson

	 I called your Royal Oak board this weekend; unfortunately the
	 telephone lines between here (Seattle) and there are so bad the
	 modem couldn't handle the garbage on the lines. This is the fourth
	 time I have called your board over the last year. The telephone
	 lines seem to be getting worse. Any suggestions?

Someone will probably tell me that I should just send floppy disks to some
place that has programs available on disk. Since I have a CP/M machine with
a unique format (ever seen a Datavue 353 with a 1M floppy drive -- actually
776k?), I can't get any programs on disk (or buy a copy of WordStar v4.0 -
sigh). The only way to get programs is over a modem. I also have a Northstar
Horizon, but it requires hard sectored floppy disks, so it too probably
can't be used (besides, the floppy drive on the Horizon is flakey).

So, I would appreciate it if someone could tell me where I could contact a
bulletin board that has CP/M programs to download.

Thanks,

Hello! I am posting this for a friend of mine who has a Xerox 820 II
computer, running CP/M 2.2.

The computer was (practically) given to him, and of course, they
aren't really selling much CP/M software these days. :-)

Does anyone have any CP/M public domain software (compilers,
spreadsheets, ANYTHING!) or software that they would be willing to
sell cheaply? In particular, my friend would *really* like a Fortran
compiler...

Any help would be *greatly* appreciated!

Subject: Downloading PD CP/M programs

Does anyone out there have a list of current bulletin boards that allow you
to download public domain CP/M programs? The SIMTEL archives are not
available at this site. I also tried to send mail to LISTSERV@CICGE.RPI.EDU,
but never received any response (I assume my mailer's From: line has an
unacceptable format). Next I tried a few bulletin boards on my CP/M computer
at home. The list of CP/M bulletin boards that I have is about 2 years old,
and the numbers I called this weekend (about 10 different places around the
country) are no longer in service.

			   Attn. Keith Peterson

	 I called your Royal Oak board this weekend; unfortunately the
	 telephone lines between here (Seattle) and there are so bad the
	 modem couldn't handle the garbage on the lines. This is the fourth
	 time I have called your board over the last year. The telephone
	 lines seem to be getting worse. Any suggestions?

Someone will probably tell me that I should just send floppy disks to some
place that has programs available on disk. Since I have a CP/M machine with
a unique format (ever seen a Datavue 353 with a 1M floppy drive -- actually
776k?), I can't get any programs on disk (or buy a copy of WordStar v4.0 -
sigh). The only way to get programs is over a modem. I also have a Northstar
Horizon, but it requires hard sectored floppy disks, so it too probably
can't be used (besides, the floppy drive on the Horizon is flakey).

So, I would appreciate it if someone could tell me where I could contact a
bulletin board that has CP/M programs to download.

Thanks, 

(doctor) Doug

From: MA18@SYSE.SALFORD.AC.UK
Subject: Datestamper with ZCOM

I have recently completed the installation of Datestamper (tm) on my system
which runs Z-COM. Like many Z-users I am TPA conscious, so I didn't want to
leave Datestamper running under the command processor. The normal course of
action in that case is to move down CP/M and install Datestamper above the BIOS.
Unfortunately, this was not possible in my case as I have three different BIOSs
from the manufacturer, but only one copy of MOVCPM! I found the answer in Jay
Sage's article in TCJ number 29. Not only can you patch ZCLD to create a version
of Z to run higher in memory than it would normally, but you can do the reverse
and leave a gap ABOVE zcpr3.3, zrdos and the buffers but BELOW the BIOS. All
that I needed to do in addition was to use DDT to patch the addresses in the
IOP and the VBIOS to point to the real BIOS which had not moved. This also has
the effect of removing Datestamper from memory when switching to CP/M. For me
this is an advantage as I only switch to increase my TPA and this maximises it.
My only concern now is that this trick may not work under NZCOM!

I hope this may be of help to someone.

Subject: Encryption/Decryption

(I hope this is not inappropiate for this list...)

I have played a couple of INFOCOM's CPM games and noticed their use of data
files ('.DAT' extensions) that evidently make use of some sort of encryption.
This arouses my curiosity.  Using DDT (and another dis-assembler whose name I
forget) I am unable to tell just what they did.  I am curious for the sake of
being curious and also because it sounds like something I'd like to use myself.
I've looked at a couple of sources on encryption but they don't exactly tell
things from a CPM viewpoint.  So - If someone has the time,  is there a source
reference,  a dis-assembler (best of all),  a piece of code,  etc.,  on this
topic that one could clue me in on?  (I sure hope this is nothing propietary!)
Bear in mind that modern ages have overtaken me - I use an MSDOS machine at
work and I fear I don't know my Kaypro II and Z80 assembler as well as I used
to.  Thanks in advance.

Subject: More on Datestamper and ZCOM

Further to my note on tricking ZCOM into leaving a space for Datestamper. I
should also have pointed out that any IOPs which you want to use will also
need similar attention. At least, the three I have from Echelon (NUKEY,
RECORDER and BPRINT) all contain jumps to the BIOS which are not correctly
calculated by the IOP installation program when ZCLD has been patched as I
described. This is not a real problem as I don't install (as opposed to LOAD)
IOPs very often.

Subject: Need help with floppy drive powerdown problem

Hello All -

     I'm sure someone out there has solved this problem.. it has
bitten me enough so that I'm now out searching for a solution.

     The configuration:

	2 Shugart 851 8" DS/DD drives.
	2 NEC FD-1036A 3.5" DS/DD drives.

The problem -

     Turning off power to these drives causes the on-board electronics
to "spasm" and write random magnetic garbage on whatever diskette in
installed.  Of course, the doors are closed.  In the case of the
851's, the heads briefly load then unload... the 3.5's spin for a
second or two until the power supply drops below some critical
voltage.

     The garbage only appears on a cylinder segment; the cylinder
being where the two heads are at when the power drops.

     I can usually "fix" the 8" disks by re-formatting just the
affected cylinder and reloading the damaged files from backup.
However, the 3.5" disks resist this and I had to degauss and then
re-format.

     Hardware hacks to solve this problem would be appreciated.

Regards,
Mark Becker

Subject: CP/M 3.0 + on the C-128

 Hi...I've gradually become interested in the CP/M disk that came with my 128,
but the card that you can mail to get documentation & additional disks that
was in the System Guide was accidentally thrown away, so I am, right now, just
playing around with it. I am interested in going into more depth with the
system, though.
 I would appreciate anyone's assistance on where to find CP/M software comp-
atible with 3.0+ or uploads, possible sources for documentation or tutorials
on programming in the CP/M environand some hints & tips concerning it.

                                    Sincerely,
                                        Peter Cook

Subject: printing program

I mentioned a few days ago distributing a printing program for Epson
printers.  It's called "ep", by the way.  I think that the complete
distribution will wind up on simtel20, but it will take a while.
My thanks to Bill Swan, who is going to check out the distribution
for stuff like missing files, and to Keith Peterson, who offered to
help get it onto simtel20.

In the meantime, I made up a mini-distribution, so folks could give the
program a try and see whether it would be any use to them.  I will send
this out over the next couple weeks to those who have expressed interest.
I have tried to reply to all email, but it's not always been clear
that mail paths I used would work.  If you wrote me and got no reply,
please try again, with maybe a suggestion about what path I should
use.  I have received inquiries from: Bob Calbridge, Paul Neubauer,
Pekka Akselin, Mark W. Eichin, Jim Dumser, Jeffrey May, and
Dag Henrik Braatane.

   Can somebody help me???  I've been trying to use ftp to "get" files
   from Simtel20.  It works fine with small files, both ascii and
   binary.  But large files appear to hang-up.  I get "Auto logout -
   job idle too long" after about 10-15 minutes.  In these cases the
   file left in my directory has a length of 65,535 bytes.  Very
   suspicious, that's 2^16 - 1!  I'm running ftp on a SUN system
   (UNIX) using TENEX mode.  I tried binary with identical results.
   The files I'm trying to pick up are things like suprdos2.lbr,1
   or zcpr33.lbr,3 or z80dos10.lbr,1 .... the good stuff!  What am
   I doing wrong???  Thanks.

Subject: Floppy powerdown

I started having this problem after I added "a few boards" to my aging 
NorthStar computer.  I believe that it relates to the order of power supply 
drop out.  I suspect that you need to insure that the 12 volts goes away before
the 5 volt (logic).  But of course it could be the other way around.  So why 
did I answer your query , you say, If I don't know?  Well, I am pretty sure 
that it is power supply related and you can experiment to find out which 
voltage must drop first to insure safety.  Peace

Subject: Followup: Disk Drive Powerdown Problem

Hello -

     My thanks to those that responded to my help request regarding
turning off floppy drives with the doors closed.

     The Fix (at least the one I implemented): Installed some relays
in series with the power feed to the disk drives.  These relays were
some generic DPST types from a local surplus outfit.. with 110 VAC
coils.

     The coils are bridged across the power supply transformer
primary.  Now, if the AC power drops, power to the drives is cut
before the supply has time to fall to the "critical" voltage level.

My thanks again to the respondents.

Regards,
Mark

Are you sure this is an artifact of the Shugart 851 and not your

off power to the 851, even with the heads engaged.

From: Ken Wallewein <kenw%noah.arc.cdn%ubc.csnet@RELAY.CS.NET>
Subject: Debugging a new BIOS 

  I trying to upgrade the BIOS of my brother's California Computer Systems
S100 system, and I've run into a bit of a snag. 

  The system has two eight-inch single sided Shugart 801s (I _think_ they're
801s). It can use physical sector sizes from 128 to 1024 bytes. It has a 4 Mhz 
Z80, a 64k dynamic RAM board, a 4-port serial board, and a 4-drive disk 
controller using a WD 1793. All boards from CCS. It started out as plain-
vanilla CPM 2.2 with the BIOS from CCS.

  The new BIOS is written and installed; I even added ZCPR2 (I know, it's old,
but it's simple, and all I want is command search paths; my brother is not
very "computer literate").

  However, there is a rather serious bug. Whenever the system does a warm boot
while logged into B: drive (there are only A: and B:), when it goes to relog
B: it sends the heads on B: on a colision course for the spindle. Needless to
say, this is noisy, nerve-wracking, and rather hard on head alignments! :-(.
This happens consistently when using a SSSD disk on B:; I think it happens on
others formats, but not so consistently. 

  Rebuilding the system without ZCPR2 doesn't help. In fact, I think this
problem actually existed _before_ I made the changes, and that I just made it
more obvious. 

  Now we get to the _real_ problem: how do I debug it?!?!? I've tried DDT,
ZSID, Z8E, ZDEBUG17, and something known as ZBUG (does anybody have any
documentation on it? It's nice!). The problems it that all of these debuggers
appear to use the BDOS to do their I/O, and this problem involves BDOS calls
to the BIOS. Needless to say, this does bad things to the BDOS's internal
stack. ZDEBUG17 might work, but I can't get it to ride through a warm boot
:-(.

  Another complication is that, in this case, the CCP (or it's replacement)
must be intact to handle the warm boot. I've whipped up a little assembler
routine to fudge address 0005, etc., to keep the debuggers from overwriting
it, so at least that's not a problem. 

  I doubt if anyone could diagnose this problem from the description, unless
it's common to CCS disk controllers. However, I'd really like to know how I'm
going to track it down! If anyone knows of a debugger that uses BIOS calls
only, I'd appreciate the information. And what the heck could be happening
while relogging B: drive on a warm boot, that doesn't happen on A: drive, or
on initial logging of B: drive? 

  If you think this is tough, I've got a VAX problem... :-)

Subject: Undigestify program for Unix now available from SIMTEL20

The new digest format has brought on some complaints from readers
whose mailers don't include an "undigestify" feature.

Those with Unix can now undigestify using:

Filename			Type	 Bytes	 CRC

Directory PD2:<UNIX.MAIL>
UNDIGESTIFY.C.1			ASCII	  5128  6D91H

which is available via standard anonymous FTP from SIMTEL20.

It turns out that this program has been here for some time, buried in
the <MSDOS.TXTUTL> directory (no it's not an MSDOS program, it's for
Unix).  It was submitted to Info-IBMPC for their "lending library" so
readers of their digest could undigestify it.  It can probably be used,
with minor modifications, on any operating system that has a C compiler.

The actual problem is a matter of timing - If the 5 volt logic supply 
drops before the 24 volts for the stepping motor/head load solenoid
falls, you can get garbage.  Exactly what signals (head load etc) you
will get from TTL logic when the supply falls to less than 5 volts is
very hard to predict.  If it generates a head load signal and there
is still 24 volts available to the head load solenoid, you can get
a momentary load (and garbage gets written etc).  Some drives are
jumpered so that the stepping motor is always on when the drive is
selected - this usually (but it depends on the filter caps) causes the
24volts to drop quickly.  The correct solution is to set up the supply so
that the 24volts is cut off as soon as a power-fail condition is detected.
This would eliminate any chance of a stray write occuring.  Temporary
measures could consist of increasing the filtering on the 5 volt buss to
keep the 5 volt logic alive longer, decreasing the filtering on the
24 volt buss to allow it to drop faster and/or increasing the load
on the 24 volt buss with a load resistor to get it to drop when the 
power is turned off (if there is no bleader resistor and no drain on
the 24 volts, it could stay up for minutes!).  This problem can occur
with all the drives I am familiar with - its just a matter of timing!

Subject: Anybody heard of a company called High Tech Research? (Also Z280)

About 10 months ago someone in this newsgroup mentioned a product
called the "Ultraboard" that was being developed for Kaypro computers.
It was being worked on by a company called "High Tech Research",
which announced it at last year's West Coast Computer Faire.
It is a replacement for the Kaypro main board that uses the Zilog
Z280 CPU.

I just read in Ted Silveira's CP/M column, in the latest issue
of Bay Area Computer Currents, that the company encountered some
"bugs in the Z280" and still hasn't finished the product.
Since I am working on my own Z280 board, I would be very interested
in talking to someone at High Tech about their experiences
with the Z280.  Does anyone have any more information about them
(address, phone, etc.)?  Zilog hasn't issued any application
notes, etc. on the Z280, so it would be really useful for me
to talk to someone who has some experience with the part.

Actually, my Z280 board is coming along very well.
It will run my floppy version of CP/M, but I have
to modify my hard disk BIOS to use the Z280's on-chip
DMA controller.  Also, my floppy BIOS needs a timing
problem fixed before it will work with the cache turned on.

The board has the following parts:

Z280 CPU
2 2732 EPROMS
2 32Kx8 static RAM chips
2 Address latches
2 16L8 PALs
2 TTL glue chips
1 6850 ACIA serial chip (included for software compatibility)

The disk controllers and many other things are on seperate boards.
Sometime I plan to add 512k of memory in the form of 4 256Kx4 
dynamic RAM chips, which will let it run in burst mode with a 10 MHz
bus clock.

Some preliminary benchmarks:

The classic Sieve program, compiled with the Software Toolworks C
compiler (I think):

Original 4 MHz Z80:				34 sec.
9.8 MHz Z280, no cache:				45 sec.  (!!!)
Z280, instructions cached, no burst mode:	16 sec.  (whew!)
Z280, data and instructions cached:		13 sec.

Basically, we get a 2.5x speedup on the same .COM files.
Having burst mode memory would not affect this benchmark much since
its inner loops probably fit entirely in the cache, and few external
memory accesses are needed.

An off the cuff analysis tells me that a simple modification of
the compiler to substitute new Z280 instructions for subroutine
calls would speed it up another 50%, and a fancier compiler would
give another 25% speedup, giving an ultimate time of about 5 sec.
for the Sieve benchmark.  (BTW, the sieve runs in 3 seconds
on a 8 MHz V-30 with Turbo C 1.5).

If you can tell me something about High Tech Research,
or are curious about my project, send me mail.

I have modified the undigestify.c program mentioned in a previous

digest.  (also tested with Info-IBM and Info-Kermit digests).

The new version of undigestify.c is now available via standard

Filename			Type	 Bytes	 CRC

Directory PD2:<UNIX.MAIL>
UNDIGESTIFY.C.2			ASCII	  5139  3DA1H

If compiled as is, the default output file names will be vv.nn.  If
LONGNAME is defined, (on Unix, at least 4.3BSD, this can be done as
cc -DLONGNAME undigestify.c), the default name will be of the form
<digest-name>.vv.nn.

I don't think it does anything special that would prevent it from
compiling with any reasonable 'c' compiler.  The mods didn't add any
new constructs that weren't already in the original except a #ifndef
directive. The original had a #ifdef.  Too bad there are so many
flavors of unix/c/etc.

HTR has been experiencing some"problems with the NCR video chips".  These 
problems are reported as being solved, but HTR may switch to Hitachi chips 
instead, which might add $50 to the price.  

The Advanced Concepts Engineering hard disk controller will be available as
a $99 option.

The bug-free Z280 is supposed to available in quantity by Jan. 1.  If HTR
stayed with the NCR chips, they were hoping to start production in Nov.;
if they switched to the Hitachi chips, production will be delayed until
the first of the year.  If any boards are produced before the bug-free Z280,
HTR will upgrade them for $40.

Subject: Sieve benchmark for Z280

A year ago, curious about the speed of compilers vs. hand-optimized
Z80 code, I wrote JETPRIME.  It proved about 140% faster that
Turbo-Modula 2, which itself was much faster than Turbo Pascal, BDS-C,
and a number of 8088 compiled versions.  JETPRIME, on 4Mhz Ampro
Littleboard, was 4.1 sec for 10 iterations; TM2 was about 10.

JETPRIME.LBR or JPRIME.LBR is available on ZNode-Central,
408-432-0821.  It may also be on other boards, and simtel20.

I'd be curious to hear how it holds up on the 280.

My third-hand understanding is that the current z280 mask doesn't
correctly handle code (and data?) changes that occur in the
associative cache memory.  Self-modifying code is therefore
unreliable, and possibly there are problems with data values also.
