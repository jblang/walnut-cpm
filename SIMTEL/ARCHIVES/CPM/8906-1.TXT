Nope.  WS for CP/M has no footnoting capability AT ALL.  However, there is
a PD program FNOTE14 available on most CP/M BBS systems that will do either
foot or end notes.  You can also buy a commercial program called FOOTNOTE
that works with CP/M WS.

I missed the original posting so I can't use email.  A few years ago I
wrote an ISIS emulator for MS-DOS that runs Intel's PL/M-80, ASM-80,
LINK-80, etc.  There's a version for the NEC V20, which makes use
of the 8080 emulation feature in that CPU, and one that runs on
any old 8088, 286, 386, etc.  The V20 emulator is about as fast
as the 386 version.  If you would like the source and executable
for this program, I'd be happy to mail it out.

       FLAME: Patch-instructions for MEX,MDM7,IMP versus QTERM

From: RALPH%UHHEPG.BITNET@CUNYVM.CUNY.EDU
Subject: FLAME: Patch-instructions for MEX,MDM7,IMP versus QTERM

I had a pretty hard time adapting MEX to my (very self-built) computer
system, and eventually gave up. The reason is probably not so much
with me (quite a bit of assembler experience, my own BIOS, etc), but
with the documentation:

There is no reasonable instruction for writing MEX overlay files !
Same applies to MDM7 and IMP, which use essentially the same format
for their overlays. All I found were instructions which overlay
applies to which computer/modem combination, and how to install
overlays. No help if you have to write your own overlay.

I had nearly given up on XMODEM communications when I found QTERM on
SIMTEL.  And there were completely clear patch instructions in the
QPATCH.DOC file in the QTERM library. Getting it up and running should
now take only a few hours at worst !

Dear authors of MEX, MDM7, IMP and suchlike: Are you listening ? Can
something be done to remedy the situation ?? And if not, does some
guru out there have such patch instruction for MEX which could be
uploaded to SIMTEL ???

Sorry again for taking network bandwith for a FLAME.

I'm not sure, but I know who WOULD be sure:  Bridger Mitchell.  He's
the author of a commercial program called DOSDISK.  It runs on my
'84 Kaypro/TurboROM, and it MAY be available for the SB180FX.  To
get in touch with Bridger, try one of the Z-nodes around the country;
Lillypute ZNODE in Chicago is (312)-649-1730; you might want to try
there first.

Ah come on Richard.  The Robin comes with a Z80 (as did the Rainbow).
Sure, it has a DEC 21-class part number on it, but it's a Z80.  The 
Z80 version should run just fine.  It's interesting how soon the Robin
is forgotten at DEC. (They were referring users to me a year ago!)

By the way, anyone have an 8088 Focal?

The MexPlus package I mentioned is the follow up to the Public Domain
Mex you found on Simtel.  It is available from Niteowl Software in 
Ft. Atkinson, WI.  1-800-Niteowl is the ordering line.

I don't have my docs here, but info for Ft. Atkinson should have their
tech support number if you have questions.  The 800 line is for orders
only.

Subject: MS-DOS diskies.

In the SIMTEL directory <cpm.dskutl> there are a few programs that
supposed-ly (according to the 00-index.txt) lets you read IBM-PC diskies
on the CP/M.  I downloaded two of them; one of them does not work.
(My QX-10 has 256-byte sectors, whereas MS-DOS does 512-byte.  I tried
CP/M-86 format which is available on my computer, but it doesn't work
on double sided disks.  Single-sided, I have yet to try) - that's
RDMSDOS.lbr.  The other one, READ-PC.LBR, is in Turbo Pascal, so I can't use it,
yet.

I am trying to get another one, RDMS233.lbr, but the RPIECS keeps refusing
to send it to me (and blame it on the network congestion), so I can't
say anything about it.

If you have an IBM compatible around, you could peep into <MSDOS.DSKUTL>
and see what they've got.  My request for directory listing is stuck
at YALEVM right this moment.

Good luck.

I suspect that EVERYBODY reading this newsgroup knows of SLR systems.

I switched to the SLR assembler for a number of reasons.  One, that
it didn't force the "-$" construction on PC-relative branches (what's
an assembler for, anyway, if you have to explicitly calculate the
relative offsets???).  But the biggest factor was its speed.  I
clocked it at around 23,000 lines per minute.  At this speed, mammoth
assemblies aren't a problem.  I had gone to great pains to make my TED
editor modular, for incremental assemblies; but with SLR, I could
assemble the whole thing as a unit, and generate a .COM file, in less
time than I could assemble a single module with any other assembler.

In fact, I bought ECO-C primarily because it came bundled with a version
of the SLR assembler.

The latest address I have for SLR (1984) is:

Plu*Perfect Systems has a version of DosDisk for the SB180 and SB180FX.
The only catch is that you need the XSystems XBIOS for it to work.  
XBIOS is a replacement bios for the SB180's moves much of the bios code 
into an alternate RAM bank.  I don't have XSystems address in front of
me, but I can get it for you if you need it.

Plu*Perfect Systems' address is: 410 23rd St.
				 Santa Monica, CA  90402

The price for DosDisk for the SB180 is $35.

I believe that there is also a version of Uniform for the SB180, but
I don't know how to get in touch with the people who market it.

[File: SIMTEL-ARCHIVES.INFO		Last revised: April 26, 1989]


                     THE SIMTEL20 ARCHIVES

OVERVIEW

There is a collossal amount of free public domain software for the
CP/M, PCDOS/MSDOS, Macintosh, and UNIX operating systems, and for the
DoD standard programming language, Ada, in several archives on
WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL (IP host number 26.2.0.74), a DECsystem-20
running the TOPS-20 operating system at White Sands Missile Range,
New Mexico.  Archives of correspondence for several newsgroups are
also available.

You can obtain these files using the InterNet file transfer protocol,
FTP (described in a following paragraph), with user-name "anonymous".
For a login password, use "guest", your host-name, or any other string
of printing characters.  Throughout this message, FTP examples are
given in a GENERIC syntax.  You will have to consult either local
documentation or your friendly system wizard to learn the actual
syntax used with your local mainframe operating system.  For the sake
of brevity, the full host name "WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL" will be
dropped from further references to SIMTEL20 in this discussion.

To obtain directory listings, connect to SIMTEL20 via FTP and do this:

  get pd1:<msdos>msdos.crclst
  get pd1:<pc-blue>pc-blue.crclst
  get pd2:<cpm>cpm.crclst
  get pd2:<cpmug>cpmug.crclst
  get pd2:<sigm>sigm.crclst
  get pd3:<macintosh>macintosh.crclst
  get pd3:<misc>misc.crclst
  get pd2:<unix-c>unix-c.crclst
  get pd2:<ada>ada.crclst

There is also a comma-delimited directory listing in each top-level
directory, FILES.IDX, which is suitable for importing into a database
program.  This file may be of greater use than the crclst files
because it can be compared against an earlier version of the same file
to produce a complete list of files added and deleted from the
archives.  Using the comma-delimited fields it is possible to build a
script for FTP to maintain a parallel archive.  FILES.IDX can be
printed or displayed with a simple BASIC program.  For more information
see PD1:<MSDOS.FILEDOCS>AAAREAD.ME.

The <CPM>, <MSDOS> and <MACINTOSH> archives are the ones to watch for
the very latest offerings, as they are updated frequently.

The <CPMUG>, <SIGM> and <PC-BLUE> archives contain software distributed
by the CP/M Users Group, the SIG/M Users Group and the PC-Blue Users
Group respectively.  This software is available on diskettes from the
associated user groups, and the archives are updated as new volumes
are issued.  The <PC-BLUE> archive contains software for the IBM-PC
and similar machines.

The <MSDOS> archive also contains software for the MSDOS and PCDOS
operating systems; but this archive is locally managed, and therefore
is updated more frequently than the <PC-BLUE> archive.

The <UNIX-C> archive contains a variety of UNIX tools.  Those which
apply specifically to CP/M are in the directory <UNIX-C.CPM>.

The <ADA> archive is growing rapidly. Information about this archive
is in directory PD2:<ADA.GENERAL>.  In general, the archived software
is very good, having been worked-over and refined by many users.  The
documentation and comments tend to be complete and informative.

Files in all of these archives can be obtained using the FTP procedures
described in this message.

PLEASE NOTE:  Due to the large number of files available, the archive
maintainers cannot possibly attempt to validate the proper operation of
the various programs.  When a program bug is reported, immediate action
is taken to either correct the error or remove the offending program
from the archives.  Still, users must understand that all archive
programs are offered AS IS, and the archive maintainers specifically
disclaim any liability should these programs malfunction or cause
damage, incidental or otherwise.  When testing ANY new software, be
certain that all information stored on disk is backed-up before you
start, so that you can recover if files are damaged or erased.  This is
particularly true if you have a hard disk, in which case malfunctions
can be spectacularly disasterous.

FILE TYPES

Files are stored in two formats: Text files such as those with names
that end with DOC, HEX, INF and ASM are sometimes stored as ASCII
files, but sometimes these files are stored in binary compressed
form.  Binary storage is also used for executable (COM and EXE) and
library/archive files  (LBR and ARC).  All binary data are stored as
four 8-bit bytes per 36-bit SIMTEL20 word, with the low-order four
bits of each word filled with zeros.  If such a file is interpreted
as a contiguous string, as will happen if a straight binary transfer
is made to a 16 or 32-bit UNIX machine, the four zero filler-bits per
36-bit group will cause rather bizarre and frustrating results.

For information on ARC, ARK, LBR, squeezed and crunched files, get
PD2:<CPM>-FILES.DOC and/or PD1:<MSDOS>-FILES.DOC.

Although the type of storage used for a particular file can usually be
inferred from the file-name, this is not always true.  It is a good
idea to check the appropriate "crclst" file to ascertain the storage
format used for each file of interest.  Now, and for the foreseeable
future, storage formats for files in the <SIGM>, <CPMUG> and <PC-BLUE>
archives can be determined from their "generation numbers", as shown by
the FTP directory command.  For example, the FTP command:

  dir pd1:<pc-blue.vol001>

will yield results of the form:

  -CATALOG.001.2
  ABSTRACT.001.2
  BW.ASM.2
  BW.BAS.1
  BW.EXE.1
  COLOR.ASM.2
  COLOR.BAS.1
  COLOR.EXE.1
  ...and so on

All files with names ending in ".1" are stored in binary format, and
those with names ending in ".2" are stored in ASCII.  This relationship
will continue to apply for files in the <SIGM>, <CPMUG> and <PC-BLUE>
archives until further notice.

WARNING: Because the public domain archives on SIMTEL20 consume a huge
amount of disk space, storage capacity will be conserved by the
greatest practical use of libraries, archives, crunched and squeezed
files, all of which are stored in binary format.  If you cannot
properly transfer binary files, you are going to be VERY FRUSTRATED!
If you need help, please contact your local system wizard and provide
him/her with a copy of this message.  Having done that, if you are
still unable to make things work correctly, send a message to
ACTION@WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL and someone will try to help you.
Please provide the following information:

 1. Machine and operating system  (e.g., VAX-11/780, 4.3 BSD UNIX)
 2. Network software in use  (e.g., 3-Com UNET)
 3. Complete list of available FTP commands  (e.g., GET, PUT, etc.)

Important files in the <CPMUG> and <PC-BLUE> archives are the
CATALOG files. These files, which are stored in ASCII, contain the
"-CATALOG.nnn" files from all the volumes of their respective archives.
To obtain these composite catalog files, connect to SIMTEL20 via FTP
and do this:

  get pd2:<cpmug>cpmug.cat
  get pd1:<pc-blue.vol000>pcblue.cat

Similar files exist for the <SIGM> archive, but they are stored in
squeezed form.  These files, when unsqueezed, yields SIG0.CAT and
SIG1.CAT (the catalog).  They can be obtained using the FTP command:

  get pd2:<sigm.vol000>sig0.cqt
  get pd2:<sigm.vol000>sig1.cqt

(NOTE: That's "L-and-three-zeros" in "vol000")

FILE TRANSFER VIA FTP

FTP stands for File Transfer Protocol, a formalized procedure for
moving files among machines on the Defense Data Network (DDN) and other
networks that connect with the DDN.  The protocol is implemented by a
program often called FTP.  The different mainframe operating systems
implement FTP with variations in command syntax.  Some systems have the
remote-file-name precede the local-file-name in the command.  Others
reverse this order.  Some versions have the whole command on a single
input line, while others use multiple lines.  Read the documentation
for your local system, or consult a friendly system wizard for the
details of your local FTP command syntax.

UNIX users can do something like "man ftp" for on-line instructions.
However, not all UNIX FTP programs are called "ftp", so you may have
to snoop around in the system directories or ask a system wizard for
the correct local name to use with the "man" command.  ITS users can
do ":INFO FTP", and "HELP FTP" works on TOPS-20 and some other
operating systems.  I will be happy to update this message with
pointers to other sources of on-line documentation if they are sent
to w8sdz@WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL.

FTP transfers from SIMTEL20 can be made with user-name "anonymous".
Use GUEST for the password.  For anonymous logins, SIMTEL20 supports
the FTP "change working directory" command.  (Your local syntax may
be something like CD, or CWD).  Ignore the message which may appear
that prompts you to enter a password.  This command allows you to
specify a default SIMTEL20 directory to be used for all file
retrievals, and thereby relieves you from having to repeatedly type
"pdx:<whatever>" as part of each filename.  For example, you can do
something like this:

  cd pd2:<cpm.goodstuff>
  get filename-1
  get filename-2
  ...and so on

instead of using the longer filename forms shown in previous examples.

Users of TOPS-10, TENEX, TOPS-20 or ITS systems can use "image" or
"paged" mode for ALL transfers.  UNIX users must use "ascii" mode for
ASCII files, and "type tenex" or "type L 8" mode for binary files.
MULTICS users can use "ascii" mode for ASCII files, but binary files
require special treatment that is best described by the following
example provided by Paul Schauble <Schauble@mit-multics.arpa>:

 !ftp simtel20
  220 WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL FTP Server Process 5Z(14)-7 at [date/time]

  user_ftp:  !login anonymous
  331 ANONYMOUS user ok, send real ident as password.
  Password:  !guest

  user_ftp:  !quote "type l 8" <--(NOTE: That's lowercase "L" 8.)
  200 Type L bytesize 8 ok.

  user_ftp:  !get micro:<cpm.zcpr3>alias.hlp alias.hlp
  150 Retrieve of MICRO:<CPM.ZCPR3>ALIAS.HLP.1 started.
  226 Transfer completed.
  Total elapsed time:  35.7 seconds.
  4348 bytes transferred in 18.5 seconds (1850 bits/sec).

  user_ftp:  !quit
  221 QUIT command received. Goodbye.

Lines beginning with "!" are typed by the terminal user. The received
files are stored on MULTICS with one 8-bit byte per 9-bit word, and can
be transferred to a microcomputer with Kermit (described in a
following paragraph).

All aspects of the FTP process for UNIX machines have been automated
to a high degree by a program in directory PD2:<UNIX-C.CPM>. With this
program, a simple command like "mb modm700.com" can connect to
SIMTEL20 and transfer the binary file "modm700.com" from directory
PD2:<CPM.MODEM7> to a local file also named "modm700.com", all with no
user intervention.  Batch command files containing multiple lines of
the form in the above example can be run in no-hangup background mode
to transfer whole directories without the user even remaining
logged-in on his local system.  For more information, get the file
PD2:<UNIX-C.CPM>AUTOFTP-DOC.TXT.

NEWSGROUP CORRESPONDENCE ARCHIVES

Copies of correspondence for several newsgroups are kept on SIMTEL20
in directories with names of the form PD2:<ARCHIVES.KEYWORD>, where
"KEYWORD" has been chosen to indicate the associated newsgroup. At
present, the following correspondence archives are available:

     newsgroup        mail archive filename
  ---------------     ---------------------
  ADA-SW              PD2:<ARCHIVES.ADA-SW>
  AMETHYST-USERS      PD2:<ARCHIVES.AMETHYST>
  INFO-68K            PD2:<ARCHIVES.68K>
  INFO-APPLE          PD2:<ARCHIVES.APPLE>
  INFO-CPM            PD2:<ARCHIVES.CPM>
  INFO-FORTH          PD2:<ARCHIVES.FORTH>
  INFO-HAMS           PD2:<ARCHIVES.HAMS>
  INFO-MICRO          PD2:<ARCHIVES.MICRO>
  INFO-MODEMS         PD2:<ARCHIVES.MODEMS>
  INFO-XMODEM         PD2:<ARCHIVES.XMODEM>
  INFO-MODEMXX        PD2:<ARCHIVES.MODEMXX>
  INFO-MODULA-2       PD2:<ARCHIVES.MODULA-2>
  NORTHSTAR-USERS     PD2:<ARCHIVES.NORTHSTAR>
  PACKET-RADIO        PD2:<ARCHIVES.PACKET>
  INFO-PASCAL         PD2:<ARCHIVES.PASCAL>
  UNIX-SW             PD2:<ARCHIVES.UNIX-SW>
  INFO-XENIX310       PD2:<ARCHIVES.XENIX310>

Descriptions of these and other newsgroups can be obtained via FTP with
anonymous login (as for SIMTEL20) from the Network Information Center's
host SRI-NIC.ARPA.  Ask for the file PS:<NETINFO>INTEREST-GROUPS.TXT
(an ASCII file).  And please note, this is NOT on SIMTEL20.

File names for SIMTEL20 newsgroup correspondence archives have two forms
For example, PD2:<ARCHIVES.CPM>CPM.ARCHIV.ymmdd-Z (files with names ending
in -Z are compressed with the Unix compress program) is a group of files
containing INFO-CPM correspondence going back several years. The characters
"ymmdd" in the file names are actually digits giving the year, month and
day of the last message in each particular file.  Current correspondence
is kept in the file PD2:<ARCHIVES.CPM>CPM-ARCHIV.TXT, which is constantly
changing. Although INFO-CPM has been used as an example here, the same
naming scheme is used for the other newsgroup files as well.  For a
complete list of available files, connect to SIMTEL20 via FTP and do this:

  dir PD2:<ARchives>

You will receive a list of names of the form:

  KEYWORD.DIRECTORY.n

where "n" is one or more digits.  For example, the INFO-CPM listing
currently appears as "CPM.DIRECTORY.1"  To then get a list of files in
a particular archive, do this:

  dir PD2:<ARchives.keyword>

where "keyword" (for example, "cpm") is chosen from the preceding list,
and the word "directory" and the number "n" are not used.  At present,
all of these files are stored in ASCII.

Subject: CP/M versions

As a newcomer to the CP/M public domain scene, I am bemused by  
the apparent number of versions of the CP/M operating system
around.  Those I have come across (many in the Simtel archives) 
include CP/M, CP/M 80, CP/M 86, CP/M concurrent, CP/M 68K and   
CP/M Plus, not to mention CP/M versions 1.4, 2.0, 2.2 and 3.0.  I   
believe all were put out by Digital Research?  I am using an
Amstrad PCW8512, which is supplied with CP/M Plus.  I gather this   
is the same as v.3.0, although not entirely compatible with 
earlier versions?  Can anyone perhaps explain the origin of all 
these CP/M's, and advise me which versions are compatible with my   
CP/M Plus?

Many of the VAX system these days expect support of the double width
and double height characters available in later versions of DEC's
terminals without reguard for the user that has older equipment.  Many
of the older VT100 emulators as well as REAL VT100 s will NOT support
the enhanced character sets.  This leaves many users rs in the cold.

I think that supporters of remote access systems need to be more
conscious of the user comunity and stop putting fancy frills on their
system.  Frills are nice when you can afford them but with lower baud
rates and remote terminals being everything from Atari's to IP sites
the remote user community cannot survive with ANSI overhead driving
2400 baud down to 1200 baud screen update e times if users can support
ANSI at all.

Sorry, I kinda got off the track, but in my 10 years of remote
computing experience I have seen systems go from helping the users to
severly handicapping the users.

Back to the original point: many of the comm programs such as IMP,
ZMP, M740, MEX and Kermit rely on the users terminal equipment to be
defined to the BIOS.  Some such as Kermit will play tricks by knowing
the terminal type you are and simulate VT52 or Z-19 term commands.
However, it is usually best, if possible, to use your built in
terminal (BIOS defined if not physical).

        Thanks for listinin'

Subject: CP/M versions

	In the beginning there was Gary Kildall, who was a professor at
the U.S. Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, California, and working
on the side (the Navy doesn't pay spectacularly well) as a consultant for
Intel, writing software to make their chips useful.
	Dr. Kildall became mightily (and rightly) incensed with the brain-
damaged excuse for an operating system (ISIS) that Intel perpetrated on
their development systems.  He therefore went out and wrote a simple
program loader cum hardware interface that he could use to do the work
that Intel was paying him for -- write programs quickly and easily.
	This first incarnation was written in PL/M, Intel's quirky subset
of Big Blue's PL/1 -- which stood for "Programming Language / One", among
other things -- thus, "Programming Language/Microcomputer".  Intel had
just decided to call the 8080 a microcomputer (this was 1979 or 80).
	"Hmmm", he said, "three letter acronyms with a slash seem to be
the in thing, so I guess I'll call this 'Control Program/Microcomputer'!"
Thus "CP/M".
	I don't know what the _very_ first version was called, but the
first version to get any commercial distribution (on Tarbell magnetic
tape, if my memory serves me, was CP/M 1.4.  This was found to be a bit
primitive, and was followed by CP/M 2.0 and 2.2. 
	In the midst of all of all of this, Dr. Kildall found he needed a
company to keep the Internal Revenue (Inland Revenu to you Brits) busies
out of his personal pocketbook.  He therefore incorporated as
"Intergalactic Digital Research, Inc."  A couple of years later, when he
needed some outside funding, he was persuaded to drop the "intergalactic"
part, so as not to freak out bankers.  "Kentucky Fried Computers" was
also persusded to change their name at about this time to "North Star
Computers" by a gang of bankers & lawyers -- the Col. was not amused.
	Also, about this time, DRI introduced MP/M for the 8080/8085/Z80
-- an operating system that permitted limited multi-programming, in the
sense that several programs could run in a round-robin scheduling
fashion, and look like they were running simultaneiously.  Very much like
UNIX, but limited to 8-bit machines.  This OS became moderately
successful on high-end micro hardware, like Bill Godbout's CompuPro
boat-anchors, but never among hobbyists or the general user.
	The last 8080/8085/Z80 product from DRI was CP/M 3.0, aka CP/M+
or CP/M Plus -- which added bank-switching to the amentities of CP/M 2.2.
The dreaded Intel 808x entered the scene at this point.

	Naturally, the leading (then) purveyor of OSs for micros could
not be left out in the cold, and a good deal of money and personnel were
thrown at re-writing CP/M for the 8086 & 8088 chips.  Therefrom issued,
in good time, CP/M-86 (CP/M for the 80x86 family).  The good old cash cow
was then renamed CP/M-80.
	While all of this research was going on (and eating money), a
couple of smart technical types in Seattle WA took the sources to CP/M
1.4 (which they or someone had bought) and ran them through an early 8086
Assembler, and came up with "Seattle DOS" or DOS86.
	There are a number of apocryphal stories about why IBM did not
sign up with DRI to provide the OS for the PC, and Dr. Kildall has told a
couple of the versions himself.  The one I like best was that Dr, Kildall
was out of town, and a couple of goons in dark suits showed up at the
offices in Pacific Grove, and demanded to see Kildall instantly.  they
were so rude and uncivilized that they were told to pack it in and take a
hike.  They did -- right to the airport and on to Seattle, to sign up
with Billy Gates' Microsoft (who went out and bought the rights to
Seattle DOS, changed its name to MS-DOS, and made pots of money).

	The research bore fruit, and CP/M-86 was followed by Concurrent
CP/M-86 (renamed from MP/M-86), GEM, DRI-DOS, and several other packages
and applications (including Ventura Publisher, done by DRI defectors,
reportedly because DRI would not fund it . . .).

- - - - - -

	There are as many varieties of CP/M-80 as there were hardware
companies or hackers who were willing to port it to their boxes, because
what DRI sold was the Basic Disk Operating System (BDOS) and the Console
Command Processor (CCP) -- each developer has to create a custom Basic
I/O System (BIOS) from hints in the DRI documentation (the less said about
which, the better!)  In other words, talking to the hardware was _your_
problem, said DRI, we provide the high-level stuff.
	MS/PC-DOS provided a set of device drivers for the standard PC
hardware (CP/M hardware was in _NO WAY_ standard), and the ability to
load custom dirivers -- vi CONFIG.SYS.  {UNIX hasn't learned that lesson,
yet!!!}

Subject: CP/M versions

	In the beginning there was Gary Kildall, who was a professor at
the U.S. Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, California, and working
on the side (the Navy doesn't pay spectacularly well) as a consultant for
Intel, writing software to make their chips useful.
	Dr. Kildall became mightily (and rightly) incensed with the brain-
damaged excuse for an operating system (ISIS) that Intel perpetrated on
their development systems.  He therefore went out and wrote a simple
program loader cum hardware interface that he could use to do the work
that Intel was paying him for -- write programs quickly and easily.
	This first incarnation was written in PL/M, Intel's quirky subset
of Big Blue's PL/1 -- which stood for "Programming Language / One", among
other things -- thus, "Programming Language/Microcomputer".  Intel had
just decided to call the 8080 a microcomputer (this was 1979 or 80).
	"Hmmm", he said, "three letter acronyms with a slash seem to be
the in thing, so I guess I'll call this 'Control Program/Microcomputer'!"
Thus "CP/M".
	I don't know what the _very_ first version was called, but the
first version to get any commercial distribution (on Tarbell magnetic
tape, if my memory serves me, was CP/M 1.4.  This was found to be a bit
primitive, and was followed by CP/M 2.0 and 2.2. 
	In the midst of all of all of this, Dr. Kildall found he needed a
company to keep the Internal Revenue (Inland Revenu to you Brits) busies
out of his personal pocketbook.  He therefore incorporated as
"Intergalactic Digital Research, Inc."  A couple of years later, when he
needed some outside funding, he was persuaded to drop the "intergalactic"
part, so as not to freak out bankers.  "Kentucky Fried Computers" was
also persusded to change their name at about this time to "North Star
Computers" by a gang of bankers & lawyers -- the Col. was not amused.
	Also, about this time, DRI introduced MP/M for the 8080/8085/Z80
-- an operating system that permitted limited multi-programming, in the
sense that several programs could run in a round-robin scheduling
fashion, and look like they were running simultaneiously.  Very much like
UNIX, but limited to 8-bit machines.  This OS became moderately
successful on high-end micro hardware, like Bill Godbout's CompuPro
boat-anchors, but never among hobbyists or the general user.
	The last 8080/8085/Z80 product from DRI was CP/M 3.0, aka CP/M+
or CP/M Plus -- which added bank-switching to the amentities of CP/M 2.2.
The dreaded Intel 808x entered the scene at this point.

	Naturally, the leading (then) purveyor of OSs for micros could
not be left out in the cold, and a good deal of money and personnel were
thrown at re-writing CP/M for the 8086 & 8088 chips.  Therefrom issued,
in good time, CP/M-86 (CP/M for the 80x86 family).  The good old cash cow
was then renamed CP/M-80.
	While all of this research was going on (and eating money), a
couple of smart technical types in Seattle WA took the sources to CP/M
1.4 (which they or someone had bought) and ran them through an early 8086
Assembler, and came up with "Seattle DOS" or DOS86.
	There are a number of apocryphal stories about why IBM did not
sign up with DRI to provide the OS for the PC, and Dr. Kildall has told a
couple of the versions himself.  The one I like best was that Dr, Kildall
was out of town, and a couple of goons in dark suits showed up at the
offices in Pacific Grove, and demanded to see Kildall instantly.  they
were so rude and uncivilized that they were told to pack it in and take a
hike.  They did -- right to the airport and on to Seattle, to sign up
with Billy Gates' Microsoft (who went out and bought the rights to
Seattle DOS, changed its name to MS-DOS, and made pots of money).

	The research bore fruit, and CP/M-86 was followed by Concurrent
CP/M-86 (renamed from MP/M-86), GEM, DRI-DOS, and several other packages
and applications (including Ventura Publisher, done by DRI defectors,
reportedly because DRI would not fund it . . .).

- - - - - -

	There are as many varieties of CP/M-80 as there were hardware
companies or hackers who were willing to port it to their boxes, because
what DRI sold was the Basic Disk Operating System (BDOS) and the Console
Command Processor (CCP) -- each developer has to create a custom Basic
I/O System (BIOS) from hints in the DRI documentation (the less said about
which, the better!)  In other words, talking to the hardware was _your_
problem, said DRI, we provide the high-level stuff.
	MS/PC-DOS provided a set of device drivers for the standard PC
hardware (CP/M hardware was in _NO WAY_ standard), and the ability to
load custom dirivers -- vi CONFIG.SYS.  {UNIX hasn't learned that lesson,
yet!!!}

Greetings.  I hope I'm posting to the correct group, please inform me

the facilities to format a blank disk.  If some veteran Osborne user

Subject: Kaypro 10 disk problem

I have a Kaypro 10 running CPM 2.2 and have been receiving occasional 'System
Status 02 - BDOS error'. I have run the CHECK program that came with the 
machine and have received the following errors on the hard disk:

Verify error drive 1 cyl 280 head 1 sector 11 (unc)  sdh=10101001
Verify error drive 1 cyl 303 head 3 sector 11 (unc)  sdh=10101011

CHECK will also report the  occasional correctable (cor) errors that clear
up the next time it is run, but these 2 always show up.  I have run FINDBAD
on the disk and it neither reports nor locks out any bad sectors.  

Does anyone know of a program I could get that would allow me the option of
selectively locking out bad sectors?  I would like to fix this without 
having to buy a new hard disk.  Any advice would be appreciated.

thanks in advance,

Gee, I bought my copy of the SLR asembler so I wouldn't have to split your

Actually, I bought it so I could speed up your brother's serial line

Subject: HELP!

Sorry if this is misposted, but I have already tried elsewhere and gotten
nothing but sympathy.

I am now the mystifed owner of a Shugart SA-1004 and SA-1400 8" hard drive
and controller, extracted complete from a Xerox-820IIH system (hence 
comp.os.cpm).  I have no Xerox 820, at least not running, but I have both
an 8" floppy controller, which the SA-1400 will allegedly talk to, and an
ST506 controller. According to some very old docs I got, back when the 
first 5.25" disks were shipped, the ST506 is "similar" to the SA-1000 series
interface, which implies to me I can hook this puppy up to my HD controller
as well.  For various reasons, the SA-1400/FDC solution is better, but I have 
NO DATA except a glossy brochure ca. 1980 on the "entire" Shugart family, up
to the SA-450 and SA-850, plus a glossy on the controller.
I also have an SA-850 that thinks it is a SSDD drive.  How do I convince it
it is a DSDD?  It came in the enclosure with the HDD, and the HD at least 
looks to be brand new, still with the shipping blocks in place.
What have I got, where can I get ANY docs on it, or should I just use it 
to replace the desk leg?
Thanks in advance.

Ouch!

I though this digest was hand-edited, or ("edited") at any rate.

Communicating at 300Baud makes it difficult to go through the detailed
history of CP/M once again - just because it was returned - informative
and exciting as it is.

There are some other lists where people never signoff when the account is
cancelled - whenever I send a message to the list, at least 4 (!) messages
concerning undeliberable mail come back!  Gues what that does to my
account quota!

One query - I thought that VT100 and VT52 were rather different:

	^[[n;nH

to move on a VT100 (n is a decimal number, printed as ascii chars: '42'),
but:

	^[Ycc

to move on a VT52 (c is a character).
Could this perhaps be that the VT52 can't do all the neat tricks that a
VT100 can, and so the programs make do (Just guessing - perhaps someone
who is in the know would like to comment).

This is exactly the case with QTERM. Here is how my thinking went.

OK. I should put in _SOMETHING_ to emulate a vt100. Now what can I expect
to be able to do on most CP/M machines without going psychotic trying to
do it.

Clear screen and moveto I already have, and they are mandatory.
VT100's clear to end of line and end of screen, and that's about it.

OK, add those features, assuming the terminal I'm working on can do it
(hence the terminal capability bitmap at 0x022f). Now I can't do any sort
of clever widgetry, like true DEC graphics, or double sized characters,
or funky screen modes, so I'll ignore those.

Now, let's see what I have:

It works with vi, rogue, moria, a couple of VT100 games on GEnie, and a
local BBS with a full screen editor that expects a VT100 emulator (i.e.
ANSI.SYS) in a P.C.

And that's how it came to be the way it is.

Minimal, enough to talk to plane jane programs, but don't expect miracles,
because a Kaypro / Osborne / Televideo / Heath-Zenith / Superbrain can't
do them.

Like so many things (e.g. Zmodem) I _COULD_ expand QTERM and add them, but
I doubt I will - as is QTERM.COM is somewhere just under 14K, but it needs
a whopping 52K of memory for full sized operation, the absolute minimum it
can survive in is 44K. Now if you have a Z-system with a bunch of RSX's
installed, it's going to be pretty cosy.

I was wondering if CP/M-80 had the write verify facility, and if it did,
if it can be turned on and off through BIOS or BDOS calls.

MS-DOS certainly does (apologies to the "CP/M on steroids" person), but
the default is "off."

It seems that the version of DISKCOPY I have has something like verify,
since it just picked out a bad track for me during formatting, but I
wanted to know if BDOS does it for ALL writing accesses.  If it does,
also, what happens to the bad track?  Ignored or marked?

Thank you

   I was a bit taken aback by Ralph Becker-Szendy's complaint about overlays
for MEX, IMP, etc.  I have done a number of them quite easily.  You just
grab an existing overlay file, preferably one that is close to what you
need, and you make your changes.  Admittedly, I have usually been making
rather simple changes -- supporting a different UART chip, adding a new
subcommand to SET, and so on.  Perhaps there are some other things one could
do with full documentation.  Also, I would be surprised if there is no
documentation floating around for MEX114 -- it seems to me that long ago I
saw such a file.  But not having needed it, I do not have a copy.

Subj: What are recommended programming editors for cp/m
Hi everyone

In case you are curious why I asked for the whereabouts of Tim Brengle a
few days ago: Because was hoping to get his ADL (Adventure Definition
Language) one of these days.

Now a "loaded" question, which will probably start another "what is your
favourite ..." war:

WHAT IS YOUR FAVOURITE PROGRAMMING EDITOR UNDER CP/M ?

A few remarks. I am specifically looking for a programming editor, not a
word processor. I know the following:

- WordStar V3.3, in use every day, but it is slow and stupid,
- WordStar V4, I heard a lot about it and should finally get it, but it
        is probably hardly better than V3.3 when it comes to
        programming.
- Express V1 (available from SIMTEL) Very powerfull, extremely
        configurable. But: Limited to files which fit in memory, a lot
        of the good features are missing. According to the documentation
        V2 (which supposedly has all the good stuff in it) should be
        available from TCI, 17733 205th Avenue, Woodinville, WA 98072;
        but that place doesn't seem to exist any longer (no phone
        number). Does anyone know what happened to them ?  I would get
        Express V2 immediately !
- VEDIT Plus, supposedly avaliable from CompuView, 1955 Pauline BLvd,
        Ann Arbor, MI 48103, (313)996-1299. Supposedly supports
        multi-window and files of any size. I only have a sales flier
        for their Mess-Dos version. Is the cp/m version still available?
        Is it any good ?
- ME, which comes with the FTL Modula 2 compiler. Supports multi-window
        editing, but is limited to editing in memory. Many features
        usefull for general editing are missing, and it is awfully slow.

In particular, I would love to have a multi-window (at least two)
editor, it  makes life so much easier. Editing in memory is hardly
acceptable. Also, it should be adaptable to ANSI (or DEC) terminals
(which have some awfull escape sequences). In particular, it should (if
possible) make use of the "restricted scroll area" feature of ANSI
terminals when windowing (since windowing with delete line / insert line
escape sequences is just too slow).

By the way ... I guess for word-processing WS V4 is unbeatable. How does
WRITE (supposedly available from Workman & Associates) compare to WS V4?

Go ahead ... flame each other about your favourite editor ... make my
day! I will just sit here, listen to all of it, and make up my mind (or
not).

What you want is Perfect Writer 1.20 -- just the editor, not the rest!
PW is an EMACS clone that uses a swap file so that it can edit files
as large as 256K.  Handles 2 windows and 7 buffers at once, very nice.
The CP/M version was shipped with most Kaypro and Actrix computers --
you should be able to get it that way.  And the installation program
will adapt it to most any terminal.

Of course! Use SED, the only superfast editor that runs on all terminals
we have (by the way, ONLY ours), adapts the keyboards to have optimal
function keys, has non-working ultrahistoric audio tape save commands,
and several bugs that are left in because they are so useful as a feature.
It is the fastest and handiest editor I've ever used in CP/M.
If you want to have it, I advise you to borrow the author with it, and
he can (but doesn't like to) adapt the editor to you personal needs.
By the way, we also have the program RECOVER that recovers a lost file
from memory if the editor unexpectedly quits (in our multi-user CP/M, this
can be done with a keypress... beware!).

Subject: "MACRO" assemblers in the Simtel.

Hello, it's me again...

Like some of you probably noticed already, I am being really cheap these
days  (I just got a pay check for 131.31 and a Mastercard bill for 100-ish)
and am trying to use the Simtel as best I can.

The thing is, I am looking for a moderately good macro assembler for Z80
mnemonics, and found a few in the <cpm.asmutl>.

Well, I have downloaded ALL of the ones described in the 00-index as a
"macro" assembler, and of the four, there was only one real macro
assembler (Z80MR-A), which allows only six characters for labels, so
I can't use it the way I envisioned.  Others (ZMACLINK, CROWECPM,
SMMACLINK, LASM-TDL) either lack the macro capacity and/or conditional
assembly.

May I suggest that the index directory be updated accordingly, or someone
can tell me how to "make
                        " them do macros... (or longer labels).

Thank you...

My Kaypro 10 had similar problems, and CHECK showed tons of errors on
the A: drive.  Most of the errors were in the directory area, and eventually 
it wouldn't even boot from the HD.  I was sure I was in for a new drive, 
so after making sure I had a good back up (or 2), I ran FORMAT.COM, to 
reformat the entire drive.  I then ran PUTSYS and PUTOVL, and restored the 
backed up data.  Everything was fine.  Curiously this happened another time,
and I had to go through the same procedure.  No further problems, and the 
Kaypro has had about 4 years of fairly heavy use since then.  (I have my
fingers crossed, though.)  I don't know if this would help your problem,
but anything's worth a try.

The CP/M 2.2 (and CP/M+) BDOS does not have a verify-after-write
feature.  There are a few BIOSes that implement one at the
physical-sector level, but it is not part of the standardized
BIOS-BDOS interface.  For example, the stock Kaypro bios had a
"writesafe" flag which, when set, caused each written sector to be
read back.  It was very badly implemented, however.

Good CP/M file copy utilities have an option to verify the integrity
of a file after writing.  An efficient algorithm is to compute the CRC
during writing, close the file, open it and recompute the CRC by
reading it into a different buffer .  (Different buffers should be used
in order to detect a *memory* error.)  Such utilities will report
verification errors and pause or terminate.

The FINDBAD tool can then be run to non-destructively read disk
sectors, and lock-out bad blocks.  It does this by creating a
directory entry (effectively a file, but it isn't written) that
contains the bad block numbers.  While that entry (marked read-only)
is in the directory, the BDOS will not write to those blocks.

A very few BIOSes have provision for spare tracks on a hard disk,
and the capability of substituting a spare for a bad track.  Switching
to a spare requires a special, BIOS-specific tool.

When bad sectors occur, you may be able to restore the disk to
full health with minimum grief if you can reformat *only* the
bad track.  Unfortunately, few format tools have this option.
Lacking that, you can try reformatting the full disk -- first backing
up everything you can successfully access.

Granted it doesn't meet all the stated requirements, particularly its missing
multiple windows, but I still like WordMaster.  Its fast, handles any size
file, and only requires about 10K.  I've adapted it to a VT200.  Was originally
available from MicroPro, just like WS which evolved from it.  Don't know if
its still available.

Subject: What are recommended programming editors for cp/m

The Mince (Mince Is Not a Complete Emacs) Editor or one of it's later
incarnations is a decent CP/M-80 editor (if you are of the EMACS
persuasion).  It edits files up to a 256K or so by virtualizing the
workspace using a swap-file.  Runs particularly fast when you put that
swap file into a RAMdisk as I did (I also hacked the swapfile's initiation
so that only the header sector would be there to begin with, and the swap
file would grow only as needed).

One of the nice things about EMACS-style editors is that they are
available in one form or another on just about any machine or O/S, so
if you use multiple machines, being a EMACS-style user can be helpful.

I still have a *very* nicely packaged 3-ring folder containing the disks
and documation to the "MrEdit" editor.  They initially tried to sell it
for a couple or three hundred dollars, then dropped the price
substantially before they exited the scene.  Anyway, if you find one of
those, it looks pretty good from the documentation (I never actually used
it much).  So, despite the dumb name, the product looked pretty decent.

One last comment.  The Mince editor only allows two screen windows (max)
at a time.  As with most non P.D. CP/M-80 S/W nowdays, just where you
get any of these things is left as an exercise for the user.....the best
editor may be "whatever you can find".... :-)

VEDIT.

It is worth noting that I use a vintage 1979 version of VEDIT (yes, it's
ten years old) and I still haven't found anything that comes close. Now
that I have my hard disk I'm going to have to do some grunt work to
patch it for scanning user areas, and I have one other beef with it that
I can probably fix when I'm inside it.

If this doesn't work, I'll probably shell out for the latest copy, because
I don't think anything else will ever provide the features that VEDIT does.
It's a bit like QTERM - only 10K, but more stuff in it than in some editors
that are twice the size (can you say TECO command set - I knew you could).

OK - I'm going to put on my +6 ring of fire resistance ..... :-)

Even Micropro was flabbergasted by the response to the CP/M version of
WS4 - over 10,000 copies sold in the first few months.  even with the
major bug in the ZCPR install code.

I used to use an old VEDIT (plain vanilla) CP/M daily.  I like it - but there
are a few things I would have done differently.  One thing I _really like_ - it
is TOTALLY programmable as to the function keys.  ANYTHING can be put
ANYWHERE.  You can have a wordstar-style layout, as I started with, or
make it like TECO.  I used an ADM-42 terminal for a while, which has over
16 function keys, shiftable to 32, in addition to control keys.  My 
VEDIT installation was very wordstar-ish, but with several things on
function keys for one key stroke.
BTW many things in VEDIT can have an alias - to block a paragraph I used
^KB and ^KK, aliased with F3 and F4.  My roommate disn't use VEDIT enough
so he used ^KB and ^KK, I used F3 and F4.
I'd still use it if the ADM-42 hadn't died.  I acquired a Televideo 970,
and couldn't find the original VEDIT disk to regen it for ANSI.
(PS - anybody have a user/programmer manual for a TVI 970?  HELP!)
VEDIT MS-DOS is still available, I would imagine that CP/M would
still be available, even if it's not advertised.
The last ad I saw was in the Sept/Oct '87 issue of Micro-Cornucopia, and listed
Ver 1.40 $49 (single file, no windows)
    2.32 $79 (multi-file, no windows)
    2.33 $95 (multi-file, windows)
With a free fully functional demo disk that can even edit small files,
it would seem to be a deal.  The address and phone number you list is current.

I have WRITE - and was talking to alex at W&A just a couple of days ago.
It is a LOUSY programming editor.  It was written by Tony Petisch to
Jerry Pournelle's and Larry Niven's specifications to be what is is
fantastic for: generating text to be printed in 8.5 by 11.0" form,
68 columns per line, between wide left and right margins.
WRITE has pretty much stagnated since Jerry Pournelle stopped giving it
free plugs in BYTE and INFOWORLD, and most professional writers (the main
audience) switched to MuShy-DOS. 
BTW Alex Pournelle works at W&A and can be reached at cit-vax!dstar!alex
As far as I know, WRITE hasn't been touched in years.
PS - the FTL Modula editor you mention above - ME - is also from W&A.
They have a BBS oriented to W&A products at 818-791-1013,
voice on 818-791-7979.

You haven't mentioned VDE - it's on most Z-nodes, probably on SIMTEL.
I've seen flame wars from WS-lovers and VDE-lovers, and while I've never
tried VDE, I gather that it's just as flexible, and faster than WS 3.3

I'd be interested in the results of your observations.

Subject: Z80 initialization and NMI usage ?

I'm having some trouble with NMI (non-maskable interrupt) occuring during
the initialization code on a Z80 embedded system.

The Z80's NMI input is connected to an early warning powerfail output
on the power supply.

The problem code is:
	0000		DI
	0001		JR	init
	 ..
	0066		RETN			; ignore NMI
	0068	init:	LD	HL,(stack)
	006B		LD	SP,HL
	 ..

An NMI intermittently occurs before the stack pointer has been initialized.
The PC seems to be stacked to locations FFFE and FFFD.  When the RETN
instruction executes, an invalid return address (e.g. 4545) is popped
because no memory exists for addresses FFFD and FFFE.  This is causing
"very bad" things to happen :-(

SP obviously needs to be set up before NMIs can occur.


I think the following version fixes the problem:
	0000		DI
	0001		LD	SP,(stack)
	0005		JR	init

Zilog's "Z80 Product Specification" indicates that interrupts are not
sampled at the end of EI or DI.
Does this apply to INT and NMI or just INT?

After CPU reset, normal interrupts (i.e. INT) are disabled, so the
initial DI isn't strictly necessary.  I would like any RST 0 instructions
(e.g. SW somehow sees a C7 opcode) to DI as soon as possible.

Please Email responses and I'll post a summary.

Subject: Frustrated...

Hi,

Could you bear to put up with my cries here, please?

I just finished downloading, uudecoding, and unarchiving all the items
in the PD:<cpm.draco> directory of the SIMTEL.  I was really, really
excited to do this becuase this was the only compiler set that even
promised to be a good one - with documentation and all that.

I (actually, my QX-10 and the dormitory phone line) spent the whole
day yesterday and today transfering DRACO-2 and 3.  I had to write a
program that will filter out Mail and Send (Tell) messages from my
UUencoded text (I usually use ED to do this, but the file was too big
and ED is a compulsive backer-upper).  So I sit down and say, how
about an hour or two relaxing hours of games, eh?

It didn't work.  I have a QX-10 which has a subset of Televideo 920
terminal command set.  I configured the "SET" files accordingly,.  All
of the demo programs worked - pretty pictures - but all but two of the
games simply warm-booted out.

Question: IS IT possible that CP/M exits transient program because a
special character is entered through the console?  One of the games
that worked with TVI-920 definition refused to work with my customized
terminal definition.

It's about time I got a real fast Modem and a real Kermit.. I can't
take this any more (Rogue and Z80-MR are the only ones taken from
SIMTEL that satisfied me - yet I bought 100 diskies thinking that I
will find tons of exciting stuff!).

Then again, maybe I should quit networking and become a Hermit programmer...

Has anyone here had any experience (positive, I hope) with DRACO?
Does anyone know how I may contact Chris Gray (the DRACO's creator)?
Is his Alberta address still valid?

I want to be sure I am on firm grounds before I really take on using
this - I don't have much time between my two summer jobs and an
academic project...

Thank you...

84 has another 40 pin chip on it.  On my 83, I had the problems
described in info-cpm139.  I reformatted and problem cleared up.  I
had another friend with an 83 K10 and he stated he had to reformat at
least once a year becuase of simular problems.  The 84 has not had any
problems like that in the 3 years I have owned it.  It appears that,
if the hard drive is not damaged, it can usually be restored to normal
operation by reformatting.  Would be interested in hearing from other
K10 owners about their problems/non-problems they have had.

In recent articles I noticed problems with kaypro 10 disk drives
mentiones as follows:

Well it is time for a simple reminder that several Kaypro 10 owners
didn't notice in the owners manual that I found caused similar
problems for several users in our local kaypro group. This disk error
cropped up because of dust and heat buildup in the 10's.

On the back of the Kaypro 10 over the fan is a small filter (foam)
that got clogged easily. Kaypro recommended cleaning it often,
avouding heat buildup. We noticed that when the filter clogged it
would sometimes allow the first dust gathered to pull through the
filter.

Simply take the plastic cover off the fan and wash the filter.  Allow
it to dry before restarting the computer. If the filter is torn or
ragged you can find a large replacement at most hardware stores or
even at most of the ????marts in the form of an air conditioning
filter of 1/8 inch foam.

I know this sounds simple to most computer users but I found that
several kaypro 10 owners did not see this in the owners manual.

Subject: MITS disk subsystem

Hello!

I don't normally post to this group though I have been reading
it for a while.

My question:

I recently picked up a a swap meet an IMSAI 8080 computer with
a pair of MITS 8" diskette drives.  I'm sorry I don't have the
model number with me, but the controller is a two board set
with ribbon cables connecting from the right side of the boards
looking from the front of the machine.

Does anyone have CP/M configured for these drives?  I can do the
console driver if I have to, but I don't have the time to write
disk drivers, formatters, boot code etc.  I would love to get
this old beast up and running!  The computer seems to operate
ok, I was able to key in a short program through the front panel
and run it.  (I wouldn't want to key in a long one!  :-))))

I have the documentation on all of the other boards in the 
machine.  I just need info and software on the MITS disk
system.

Thanks loads in advance!!!

Subject: Express v. 1.0

One quick note about Express the editor:

I know it is intended to be a "programming" editor, but it does allow
text lines longer than 80 characters.

Well, the "free distribution/demonstration" copy I got from SIMTEL, dubbed
Express version 1.0, tends to lose a lot of characters from the lines longer
than a line around the wrap-around border.

I guess I shouldn
                 't have used it to write the personal letters, but I hope they
fixed it in the non-free version.  If they have a bug somewhere, it is likely
that there is a bug somewhere else, as well as a major architectural problem.

It's a well-designed (human-interface-wise) editor, though.  The best I have
so far.

John Shin.

P.S.  I've got to start editing mails on my QX-10; keep coming up with things
to say after I'm done.

Well, instead of using longer lines, if you hand-insert carriage returns
liberally (or appropriately) in the long
                                         "paragraphs," the editor will
adjust the right margin at your request - but each paragraph must start with
two carriage returns or a carriage return and a white space.  (I also keep
hitting CR instead of the quotsies, in case you haven't figured that out).

Subject: Kaypro 10 harddisk errors

Charles West noted the importance of adequate cooling.  Heat buildup
has caused erratic performance in several Kaypro models.  In addition
to cleaning the fan filter, a good check is to remove the metal cover
and run the machine in the open, especially when the ambient room
temperature is high.

Controller chips can get too *cold* also!  When Plu*Perfect Systems
was in Idyllwild we had a Kaypro 10 in a minimally-insulated basement
office.  When powered-op on cold (20 - 30 degree F) mornings it would
often report as many as *100* bad tracks.  As it warmed up, fewer were
reported, and in an hour all was again well.  After that, we usually
left the machine running overnight!

It probably wasn't chips, but the drive itself!  In my PC experience, many
machines equipped with Seagate 20 or 30 Mbyte drives have serious problems
with physics.  That is, parts of the drives expand/contract with
temperature changes, which, uh, moves the tracks around a little.  I've
seen a machine that had its HD formatted in an air-conditioned room start
to die after it warmed up a little.  I suspect in the above case that the
disk wasn't formatted under cold conditions, and contraction caused problems
until the disk warmed up from the PS/drive motors/etc.

So before you check your chips, stabilize the machine at a reasonable room
temperature and see if you STILL have trouble...  If you don't, I'd be willing
to bet the trouble is mechanical, not electronic!

Subject: Fast PCPI Applicards

I recently found this old file and set about speeding my Applicard up
by 40%. I now have a 10 Mhz CP/M card running inside my 7 Mhz Apple IIgs.
It's not too tough, so read all about it!...

---------- cut here ----------

Revised 6/26/89
---------------
 
     When is fast not fast enough?  When it's easy to go faster!
If you ever compared a Softcard to an Applicard you know what a
difference 4 MHz can make. It'd be great if you could make that 
same 200% increase in speed over the Applicard but that's not so 
easy.  What is easy is a 20%-33% percent increase.
     When the Applicard was designed, I doubt the designer ever
considered anything faster than 6MHz.  He did consider sound
design practices that not only make the normal card "bullet-proof"
but makes acceleration possible.  I have modified 4 cards and
have obtained reliable results at 7.160, 7.5 and 8 MHz.
    How is it possible?  Simple, just change the CPU, crystal and
depending on your memory's access speed, the DRAM too!  Here are 
three combinations I tried:
 
- 7.160 MHz:   1- change crystal from 12 to 14.31818 MHz
                  (this is a Apple crystal).
 
               2- change CPU from a Z80B to a Z80H.
 
- 7.500 MHz:   1- as above but use a 15MHz crystal.
              
               2- select 150nS RAMs until you get reliable
                  operation.
 
- 8 MHz:       1- as above but use a 16MHz crystal.
 
               2- install 120nSec RAMs.
 
 
for the brave:     
 
above 8Mhz:    1- change crystals.
 
               2- select RAM's.     
 
               3- change 7404 chip to maintain the phase 
                  relationships of the clock.
 
               4- keep things cool and cross your fingers!
 
 
     What does this effort get you?  Obviously,  if there's a
lot of I/O, the Apple will pace things.  If it's just the Z80
rolling along on its' own.... you'll get the full effect.  For
example, the Sieve runs in 91 seconds and Calculations in 42
seconds. (Standard Byte Benchmarks) at 8Mhz.  These pretty
much are direct 33% increase over 6MHz times.
 
 
Where to get the parts:
 
Z80H: try JDR or BG Micro or if all else fails, let me know.
 
120nS DRAM:  Microprocessors Unlimited
 
Crystals: JDR or BG Micro.
 
 
          A warning about DRAM's for Z80 applications:
 
    These parts must be 7-bit (aka 128 cycle refresh). The common
8-bit (256 cycle) parts used in IBM's WILL NOT work.  This rules
out TI and Matsushita.  If you get your DRAM's from uP unLTD specify
Mitsubishi.
 
The bad news..........
 
- if you have a communications program that must run at 6MHz
  or the timing is wrong, you could have problems.  MEX does
  NOT have this problem (STAT CLOCK 93, check with SLEEP 60).

NEW NOTES, 8/12/86:
 
- I've found that the clock won't always start. Selecting a
  new 74LS04 fixed the problem. Actually, I used a 54LS04
  with full Mil 883 burn-in. The first one worked fine at
  8Mhz.
 
- Bussman makes a very nice socket for their new Radial lead
  PC mounted fuses. Part number PCS. It fits the existing holes
  in the board and reliably takes wire lead crystals.
 
- Fujitsu makes a 100nS 7-bit DRAM. I got some for $2.70 from
  Marshall Electronics, try uP Unlimited.
 
- with the 100nS parts and the sockets I'm gonna go for 10Mhz
  but will probably have to change more "glue" chips.
 
- I've done four 8Mhz boards and four 7.159MHz boards to date
  all still working...

 
NEW NOTES, 8/19/86:
 
- it looks like a better part for the clock is a must. Try a
  54LS04 (same specs except for temp. but seem to be better),
  a 74 or 54ALS, a 74 or 54S or perhaps the best yet a 74 or 54F.
  The latter has the speed of a "S" and the power consumption of 
  a "LS".
 
- using a "F" clock chip and the the rest mentioned in the 8/12 notes
  above, I have things running at 9.4+ MHz. When I get a 20MHz rock
  I'll go for 10MHz.
 
 
NEW NOTES, 10/5/86:
 
- this file has been renamed to be consistent with the trend to name
  Applicard related files staring with PCPI making them easy to find all
  in one spot on a directory.
 
- I've had the 10MHz rock in for better than a month now and all works
  fine. Keeping things COOL is a MUST, even at 8Mhz.
 
- I have confirmation that the Applicard card will work with the //gs
  in the //gs high speed mode.


NEW NOTES, 6/26/89:

- This section written by Nick Sayer. I've pumped mine up to 10 Mhz without
  any trouble.

- Apparently the Z-80H is now called the Z84C0010-PEC. This chip is rated at
  10 Mhz.

- When chip manufacturers came up with 256Kx1 RAM chips, they gave up on the
  64Kx1 configuration. However, the pinout of a 256Kx1 differs from that of
  a 64Kx1 only by 1 extra address pin. The makers of the PCPI board
  conveniently tied this pin high for us, so using 256Kx1 chips instead of
  64Kx1 chips works just fine. You'll be wasting 192K of RAM, but it should
  not be too tough to use this extra space to emulate the "piggyback" RAM
  expansion board and get a 192K RAMdisk in the bargain.

Subject: Heat and Coldness

Most chips in commercial products are rated to run from 0 degree C to 70
degree C, meaning 32 F to 170-or-so F.  "Automotive" or "industrial"
chips have wider range (-25 to 85 C -ish, but varies from company to
company and depending on the label).  Military chips go from -55 to
+125 (!!!) C.  Try converting these to Farenheit yourselves.

Well, the Kaypro "cold" problem probably WAS mechanical - if it was electrical
the computer probably wasn't functioning at all.  Contrary to the numbers
given by the companies in the data sheets, most chips can endure very high
and low tempraratures beyond the stated limits (remember the SS-DD disks
you could use the both sides on, in the good-old-apple days?), but this
is difficult to be true with mechanical things (I have run a computer
with *7* volts applied to the VDD once, and it did fine.  I stopped very
fast, though.  Mechanical things may not break down as easily under stress,
but they sure as hell malfunction.)

Is this a debate topic?  Less make it private, ok?

Due to the slow clock speeds of the 6502, which does all of the I/O
for the PCPI APPLICARD, it is very capable of loosing characters.

Functions such as ringing the bell or clearing the screen takes all
of the 6502 and any further characters being recieved will be trashed
until the current process is complete.  The only way to avoid this
is to allow the board to generate a processor interupt and store the
data in a buffer until there is time to do something with it.  This
works well but you will probably have to write it yourself.  This is
not an easy task without the PCPI developers kit.  The interupt must be
written in 6502 native code and interfaced with the PCPI BIOS.  The
developers kit has the tools needed for this process.  I wrote a versio
for the Promethieus Versacard and was very succesful in getting it to
work for speeds up to 19200 bps.

beast?  If there's more than one to chose from, which one is the best?

Thanks!

Subject: CP/M 3.0 BBS wanted

I just found the Simtel20.Arpa CP/M archives, and see many BBS programs there.
I wish I could cancel that last article, but my news reader won't let me.
I'd still appreciate hearing opinions about which is best to run on a system
like mine, or if there are any commercial BBSes or any not at Simtel
worth looking into.

This is not only true for the drives of any specific hardware manufacturer.
When I started working with our company some 8 years ago, we used removable
disks (who didn't at that time?) and the first hint everybody gave you was
to insert a disk pack (remember that word: "disk pack"?), then switch
on the drive and have a cup of coffee in order to have the pack at the
proper temperature.

Does anyone out there know if MM is still alive, and if so, whether or
not they still sell or support their CP/M system for the Trash-80 4, and
if so where to get ahold of them?

Thanks in advance.

I may have one, but I would have to check.  If you have a Northstar Advantage,
it already emulates a terminal (codes are Beehive/Soroc type, I have
them somewhere -- give me a call).

In the early days of 8086, Northstar experimented with it by
creating 8088 boards for the Advantage (and I think for the
Horizon, but don't quote me on it).  The Advantage board
would run generic MS-DOS, but was not PC compatible.

I still own an Advantage, and have the Technical Reference
manual for it.  I never owned one of the 8/16 boards.

If you have a serious need, give me a call and I'll
try to help.
