I got a good chuckle out of your equating Lifeboat with good service
and technical support - I think most people who read that will respnd
in a similar manner!
Check into a company called Micah. They are located in Ca. and
advertise regularly in Infoworld. Micah supplies CP/M configured for
the Cromemco. Note that Digital Research supplies CP/M-80 just for the
Intel MDS; the initial intent was to allow each OEM to modify the BIOS
for their own hardware. Thus, you need not worry about any ersatz CP/M
- there is only one ultimate source, though each OEM is responsible
for his specific hardware implementation.

In the latest Byte (and in other mags) there is an ad on p. 86 about
just the thing you wanted.  It is a small (3 x 2 in. by the picture)
pc board with about 9 resisters, 2 chips (timer chips, I think),
2 transisters, 3 capacitors, 2 diodes, an opto-isolator, and a plug
to go to the disk drive (or the power supply, can't tell) and some wires.
Looks pretty simple to me.  It says that installation time is about
15 minutes, and ``models are now available for virtually all popular
8 inch drives (including a foreign version).''

	Company:

	OPTRONICS TECHNOLOGY
	P.O. Box 81
	Pittsford NY  14534
	(716) 377-0369

It's called the ``Device Control Unit.''   If anyone has bought one
of these, or knows any more about, please let the list know.

Oh yeah, it's got the price here too.

	Assembled and tested -- $49.95
	Kit w/ documentation -- $29.95

I have for thre nights tried to transfer the file Pourne;data
base using lmodem.
	I get maybe a page of it, after which I find myself with
the linnk resumed.  Like the sorcere's apprentice,  I see adn
watch helplessly as the same sentence repeats endlessly.
Control z, escape, and indeed no key I have will do anything.  I
finally must do an at-sign and c to close my connection.  Then I
have to  try to get back onto the net again.

Is the failure of lmodem related to the general flakiness of the
net?  I note that  I can sit here at 0300 and watch the machine
hang for 2 minutes at a time, before it will echo anything
typed; this may cause the lmodem program simply to time out?
(or my receive program times out)?
	Or is there smething special I don' tknow about?  I'd
sure like to be able to get that file here where I can read it.
I intended to use some of the concepts in my column, but this is
ridiculous.

Information appreciated.

CDOS is not necessarily compatible with applicatinss under CPM 2.x,
due to the added calls. Some may be able to work, though. Only way
to find out is to buy and try. The best alternative is to buy a 2.2 for
your Cromagnon. Then you can run ZCPR, etc. There is also a CDOS
filter for running CDOS programs under CPM , in the CP/MUG library.

The MODEM programs we use down here fall into the routine GETACK after
a block is sent to get the response from the reciever.  In ours, anything
but an ACK is taken as a NAK.  This causes a problem with the new version
(5?) of TOPS-20, which tries to enforce flow control on the comm link,
causing the sending micro to recieve 'random' DC1 and DC3 characters.  This
forces the link into a continuous retransmit sequence.

Our solution:  after the check for ACK in GETACK, throw in a check for
a NAK with these two lines:

       CPI  ACK     ; Already in
       RZ           ; the GETACK routine
       CPI  NAK     ; Added to
       JZ   GETACK  ; routine

This forces MODEM to accept only ACK or NAK as valid block control messages.
The only problem I see is when a true ACK or NAK is perverted on the line,
which this mod will ignore.  In this case, a timeout will have to occur
and the block be retransmitted.  If anyone sees any other problems,
please let me know.  Thanks,

Doug Huneycutt

A few weeks ago I discovered that Epson is drying up the supplies of
MX-80/FT's (and presumably all variations on the -80).  A number of
local dealers are unable to reorder their standard weekly supply of
MX-80's, and all they know is that Epson is discontinuing the -80,
replacing it with a new printer called the 'FX-80' (??).  Nobody seems
to know how the FX-80 will be superior to the MX-80.  I saw what the
exhibitor claimed to be an FX-80 at the CP/M-83 show, but was unable
to get much info about it.  It resembled the MX-100, was supposed
to print at 120 cps, and cost $750.

It seems strange that Epson would discontinue the world's most successful
printer.  I presume that the -80 will continue to be supported.  Anyone
know more about this?

  Thanx to someone on info-cpm, I did eventually find a hard disc backup
program.  I had the opportunity to try it out this afternoon and it works
fine.  It breaks up large files so that they can fit on multiple floppies.
It also has the ability to do incremental dumps.  I'm not sure how it
works, the guy on the phone said it considers a modified file to be one
with a different disk allocation.  I suppose that means it won't
automagically work with files that are modified through random access disk
operations.  You can however specify files that are always to be dumped.
In any case, it's a nifty package.  You can get it from STOK Software,
Inc.;17 West 17th St.; New York, NY 10011 (ph.212-243-1444).

Several problems have converged to cause problems with LMODEM
transfers to and from MC - thus the dearth of new material in MC:CPM;.
The problem does not lie with either LMODEM nor your end.  The problem
is a combination of ARPANET backbone problems (MIT is/was connected to
the rest of the net by one circuit instead of the normal two - and
that one has been flakey), memory problems at MC itself, and in
general, high TCP overhead in the net (compared to the old NCP).
Another problem related to all of this for some of us, when everything
else does perform "properly", is the fixed-size 64-byte TAC input
buffers can be (and are) overrun when trying to upload 132-byte blocks
at 1200 bps...

What all this means is that until these other problems are
solved/fixed, there is little you or the rest of us can do, short of
modifying LMODEM (and MODEM on your end) to tolerate very long pauses
in transmissions...  and by the time that is done, I would hope the
problems that caused the change would have been resolved.

1. Thanks to all who took the trouble to respond to my plea for
HELP.  I have more friends than I would have thought.

2. RE C PRIME.  
	In the December BYTE I mentioned that MDBS, that wierd
outfit near Purdue, was doing an enhancement to BDS C, but it
wasn' t out yet.
	On December 17 we received a letter from one Dr.
Koehler, President of MDBS, protesting that I was nuts (neither
he nor Holsapple care for my evaluation of their documents,
which I find unreadable, and although their documents talk a lot
[incomprehensibly to me] about CODASYL standards, they  protest
vigorously that MDBS is neither hierarchical nor CODASYL but
"post CODASYL" whatever that means.
	I cheerfully admit I am no authority on data bases.  I
tried to learn from Holsapple's "Primer" and soon gave up.  I am
apparently too stupid.
	However: they also protest that their BDS C, called C
Prime, has "been out for months."  Now I wrote my article in
June and read it to them then; they told me they would send me a
copy of C Prime immediately it was out.  At Minimicro -- when
was that, October??  -- a press rep of MDBS had me paged, and
insist ed that I carry on the spot about 12 pounds of documents
despite my protest that I do not review documents, only programs
I can use.
	At the time I asked about the enhanced BDS C.
	Not availabe, I was told.
	in the December 17 letter to BYTE Koehler says it has
been "out for months".  His tone implies that I am either stupid
or have malice against the product.
	As anyone who's read my stuff knows, I  think of Leor as
a friend, and I admire BDS C a lot.  I looked forward to getting
the MDBS enhancement.
	They never sent it, or a notice that it existed.
	Not being telepathic, I did not review it.  Remaining
untelepathic, I still can't because I don't have it.  I do not
thnk I will   again communicate with the MDBS people at Purdue,
so I fear I will remain unable to review Leor's enhanced
product.

My apologies.

If LMODEM times out and you are dumped back to the link, it
endlessly repeats t he last sentence or so it tried to send.  is
there ANY possible interrupt of this other than doing an at-sign
c and closing the link, then opening again, logging in again,
refusing to attach (if you attach you are back there again!) and
then killing the job from outside?

I would have thought there might be a more convenient  way out
of that trap.

If you know someone with a system that runs MP/M version 1 or 2, there's
a program that DR includes called GENHEX which does exactly what you want.

It *will* run under CP/M also, you might give DR a call to see if they will
sell you a copy.

You're right, the supply of MX-80's has just about completely dried up.
Epson is getting ready to release a new line of printers called FX-nn
(a few have already been sent to dealers, but not more than a handful).

We write some software for the MX printers and were demonstrating (Fancy
Font) at CP/M '83 on those printers.  Epson dropped one of the new FX
printers off at the booth Friday evening, we plugged it in and were up
in a matter of seconds.  The point is, it is entirely upwards compatible
with the MX.  The exciting part is that it is twice as fast (160 cps I
believe in normal printing mode) and furthermore it has twice the
horizontal graphics mode resolution giving it a raster image of 216v x 240h.
That puts it very close to the imagen-like printers in overall quality
at about 1/30th the cost.

Warning: a lot of dealers are pushing other printers because they can't
get Epsons.  They say whatever one they're pushing has better resolution
than Epsons, because they have more pins or some-such.  But, for graphics
mode resolution nothing beats an Epson (MX or especially FX) so before
you buy any printer check the graphics mode; that's where all the good
stuff happens.

    Re:   one more thing...

    If LMODEM times out and you are dumped back to the link, it
    endlessly repeats t he last sentence or so it tried to send.  is
    there ANY possible interrupt of this other than doing an at-sign
    c and closing the link, then opening again, logging in again,
    refusing to attach (if you attach you are back there again!) and
    then killing the job from outside?

    I would have thought there might be a more convenient  way out
    of that trap.

    Thanks,

    JEP
-----
Try sending a control-U (^U) every time it sends the sentence.  You may
have to repeate this up to ten times untill LMODEM aborts sending that
sector on error count.  Note that control-U = <NAK> so LMODEM thinks
that your local modem program has sent a <NAK> 10 times in a row and
gives up when the error count is reached.
-Paul
P.S. Be sure to wait untill the entire sector is sent each time befor
typing ctrl-U of LMODEM will flush it as line noise..

Ben,

You are allowed 10 retries on a read/write attempt.  With the motors just starting
to spin you'll get errors, but you will be up to speed within the 10 and then off
and running.  I know that it is not a clean approach but it has two things in its
favor:
1. It is cheap
2. It works

Small C version 2.0 is now available on MIT-MC in the CPM directory.
The file is 92k long, so if you FTP it make sure you have room.
It's apparently the entire source, but looks to me as if it needs
to be compiled on some form of C (probably Small C version 1).
Maybe someone will look it over and tell us what needs to be done.

This is the same Small C version 2.0 that recently appeared in
Dr. Dobb's Journal.  Thanks to Ben Goldfarb for forwarding it
to me from Usenet.

The filename on MC is:

that runs on an 8088 ??  I am most interested in getting something
running on the DEC Rainbow, however the easiest way is to work
with the 8088, as the comm ports are not directly accessible
to the Z80.

	Along the same lines, does anyone have any experience or
info about the Mark William's Company (?) C compiler that DEC will
sell you for about $700.  How about any decent C compiler for
the Rainbow??   Anyone seen MS-DOS on it yet ??

A few weeks ago, I sent a message to this list (was it info-micro,
info-cpm, or both?) asking if anyone had a high order language
implementation of a program which would take a CP/M .COM file and
convert it into Intel .HEX format.  I have received several replies both
privately and to the list.  Thanks for the info on the software that
runs under CP/M or MP/M, but I want to run on a big timeshare system
that doesn't run 8080 object.

I received a message from "dudley at NADC" who has some
not-quite-complete-but-pretty-close C source code.  I also received a
message from "reece at NADC" asking me to let him/her know what I found
out.  My mailer can't get through to either party.

I also received an offer of source from "decvax!genradbolton!rick", but
I guess I can't figure out how to send to there, either, because my
mailer choked on that one, too.

My thanks for the offers of HOL implementation source.  Yes, I am still
interested.  My address is:

I called Digital Research last week and received the following info:

CP/M (TM) 68K will not be released until 3/15/83.  The price will be
$350.00.  The package consists of 5 8" single density floppy disks,
and contains a C compiler, an assembler, a loader/linker/library manager,
a debugger (DDT), a line editor, and several familiar utilities such
as PIP, STAT, etc.

CP/M 68K is a single tasking, single user system a la CP/M 2.2 for
the 8080 and Z80.  Most of the system is written in C.  Digital Research
has not announced or committed to releasing Concurrent CP/M, CP/M+, or
MP/M for the 68K.  I assume such follow-on products will be made available
if market response warrents.

CP/M 68K in its initial release is certainly not a UN*X substitute, but
it does seem to offer a reasonable set of tools for a reasonable price
to let us home hackers start making some use of the 68K.

I need to correct one or two minor points about the CP/M-68K.  The production
release is going to be shipped late this week.  The March-15th date was a typo
in an inner-office memo.  

The production version is substantially the same as the Beta version I have   
running on a Tandy Model-16.  It is about 2/3 of the way between CP/M-2.2 and
CP/M-Plus, with many of the features of ZCPR.  It does not have command-line
editing.  Nor does it have date-and-time stamping, but it does not interfere
with them.  Thus in dual processor systems like the Model-16 both CP/M-Plus
and CP/M-68K can coexist on the same diskette without problem.

The release version from DRI is, like all DRI systems, not configured to any
particular machine.  But they do provide a ExorMac bootable diskette and 
example BIOS.

In addition to the usual utilities, the system comes with a 68000 assembler
and a C compiler.  

I've got a little more info I can send anyone who would like it.  Send me
a U.S. Snail address.

Hi, all.  I ran into the problem recently of doing a load and go on a random
text editor in a manner that was transportable to any CP/M system. As it
turned out, I was able to do this with Vedit, but not with the standard
editor, ED.

ED, it seems, does not like being loaded by anything but the CCP.  It won't
go under DDT, and it sure as heck won't go under my program. I tried to
duplicate all the documented entry conditions: dma pointed to 0080H, the
command line buffer filled with the file name, and the default FCB at 005CH
set up properly.  I even kept the CCP around, as well as CCP's stack
pointer, although it looks as though ED doesn't care about that.

I'd like to know if this problem crops up on CP/M systems other than
an Apple II using the Microsoft Softcard (2.20B), and if so, whether
there is a cure.  If any of the suggested cures work (assuming there
are some), I will post 'em to the net or otherwise find some way
of making them available.  Thanks.

Finally!  After many problems with FTP, I got the UNIX versions of
the Richard Greewlaw SQUEEZER package over to MIT-MC.  This version
makes files compatible with the CP/M version so if you have UMODEM
working on your UNIX machine you can squeeze files there before
downloading - saving about 30% of your download time!  It's
also useful for archiving ANY ascii files on a UNIX machine
since it reduces the disk storage space by about 30-40% on
most ascii files.

Thanks to Ben Goldfarb for forwarding these programs to me.

The files are on MC as:
  AR43:CPM;XSQ 107C     the squeezer
  AR43:CPM;XUSQ 107C    the unsqueezer
  AR43:CPM;XTYPE 107C   so you can "type" the squeezed files while on UNIX.

Finally got sq.c going on BRL.  How do you solve the problem
that ascii files saved on a UNIX machine contain no CR's,
only LF's at the end of each line?  I squeezed a file on
UNIX and UMODEMed it to myself and UNsqueezed it on my
CP/M machine only to find that the file was still in the
UNIX format for end-of-lines.

The usq.c for UNIX has an option to remove CR's while
unsqueezing.  Maybe sq.c should have an option to ADD CR's?

If Shawn@Ml sends more messages to INFO-xxx lists instead of
INFO-xxx-REQUEST asking to be removed from the list I think we
should all forward his messages right back to him.

Is there any easy way to get sweep to work with more than 4 disk drives?
No one in town has the source for it -- is it available?  If not,
does anyone know how to patch the .COM file?

Has anyone here worked with CP/M enough to know if it is well behaved as
a CP/M application program? By this I mean that it uses only the
documented CP/M system interfaces and thus can be run on other
look-alike operating systems.

I particularly need to know if the current release of BDS C will run on
CP/M 3.0 and on TurboDos. If anyone has tried this or otherwise knows, I
would very much like to know about it.

    Re:   ZCPR2 Release

            The release of ZCPR2 is more-or-less on schedule.  Two of
    the four manuals are virtually finished, and some bugs have shown
    up in some of the utilities, but I think they will  be  ready  by
    the 10 Jan release date.

            As scheduled, today is the release of drafts to the  ARPA
    Net.   I will try to upload the drafts of the Concepts Manual and
    the Installation Manual to MIT-MC tonight.  I  will  send  out  a
    message  when they are there.  The only hitch I can see right now
    revolves around TCP conversion.

            The following is a summary of what will be uploaded.   At
    the  time  of the upload announcement, I will also send a summary
    (rather long) to INFO-CPM.

    ZCPR2 Concepts and Installation Manuals
            First Draft Release

            The Squeezed Forms will have  been  uploaded  to  MIT-MC.
    They  will  be  stored  in the CPM directory, and their names are
    Z2CON and Z2INS with types of WQ and WQH (i.e., Z2CON WQ  is  one
    manual).


            The Concepts Manual is over 60 pages long.
            The Installation Manual is over 27 pages long.

	Thanks for your interest, Jerry.

	ZCPR2 Version 2.0, Mod 0.1 (sorry about the mod -- can't have
everything) was released at 10PM Friday Eve, 4 Mar, right after my talk
on ZCPR2 to the Amateur Computer Group of NJ.  I'll drop a note to the
ARPA Net (INFO-CPM) tonight with details.

Are there any bulletin board/electronic mail software packages
that can be used on a CP/M OS in a network environment.  The
network will consist in three Z80/64K machines.  The software
needs the following capability:

    1.  Create, send, store, retrieve, edit, and delete both data
and messages.

    2.  Originate from any terminal to any one or both of the
other terminals.

    3.  Alert the user of new messages.

    4.  Route traffic from any terminal to a network printer.

Thanks for any help.

        As I mentioned earlier today, ZCPR2 has been released  as
of  last  Friday, 4 Mar.  I promised more data, so here is a sum-
mary of what is involved in obtaining it.

        First, the size.  ZCPR2, as  I  presented  it  to  SIG/M,
covered  ten  8"  floppy  disks.  In addition, the latest SYSLIB,
Version 2.4, is required to assemble most of the ZCPR2 utilities,
and  the  upgrade covers two more disks.  A hardcopy of the docu-
mentation would also be helpful, and the  five  manuals  which  I
gave  to  SIG/M  total  420  pages (one-sided) and are two inches
thick.

        This sounds like a lot, and it is, but you  do  not  need
all of this to bring ZCPR2 up initially.  To simply bring a ZCPR2
system up, you need the documentation, Disk 1 (which contains the
source  to  ZCPR2, its header file, and a sample redirectable I/O
package), and Disk 5 (which contains COM files of  the  31  ZCPR2
utility  programs and a template around which you can design more
utility programs).  This is only two of the twelve disks.

        The real problem is in the documentation.   Five  manuals
were  released  with  ZCPR2, three of which are required to learn
about ZCPR2 and install it.  These three manuals are:

        1.   The  Installation  Manual.   This  tells  you   what
hardware  and  software is required for installation, how to cus-
tomize ZCPR2 to your liking, how to install ZCPR2 on disk, how to
customize the cold boot routine in the BIOS in order to fully im-
plement ZCPR2, and how to install the utility programs which come
with ZCPR2.  This manual is 48 pages long.

        2.  The Concepts Manual.  This manual is  a  tutorial  on
what ZCPR2 and the ZCPR2 System are, what their key features are,
and how ZCPR2 is intended to be used.  This manual  is  65  pages
long.

        3.  The User's Guide.  This manual is  more  tutorial  on
the  ZCPR2  System,  describing  all the subsystems and utilities
which come as part of the ZCPR2 System.  Included in this  manual
are the redirectable I/O system, the XDIR3 directory utility, the
library utilities, the Menu Subsystem, the file copy utility, the
command file processors, the utilities which manipulate the named
directories, the ZCPR2 resident commands  and  their  alternates,
and  the  online  documentation system.  This manual is 138 pages
long.

        To summarize, two disks and three manuals are required to
first  bring up the ZCPR2 system.  Disks 8, 9, and 10 of the dis-
tribution contain copies of these three manuals in a format  sui-
table for printing by Word Star with MailMerge.  SIG/M also has a
hard copy of the manuals, and they are working on the details  of
how to distribute this.

        The other disks in the ZCPR2 distribution are:

                Disk 2 - Sources to ZCPR2 Utilities assembled by MAC
                Disks 3&4 - Sources to ZCPR2 Utilities assembled
                        by M80/L80 with SYSLIB 2.4
                Disks 6&7 - Help Files; the entire User's Guide is
                        available as online documentation

        There are already three disks in the distribution of SYS-
LIB  2.0,  and  two disks are available which upgrade these three
from 2.0 to 2.4.  These two disks contain a REL  file  of  SYSLIB
2.4,  sources  to all utilities which changed or were added, Help
Files which were changed, and new SYSLIB manuals.  If you wish to
be  able  to reassemble the ZCPR2 utilities, most require M80/L80
and SYSLIB 2.4.

        The other two manuals presented to SIG/M are  the  User's
Guide for SYSLIB 2.3 (fine for use with 2.....4) and the User and Re-
ference Manual for SYSLIB 2.4.

        Summary:

                1.  To Install the ZCPR2 System you need --
                        Disk 1 (ZCPR2 Source)
                        Disk 5 (ZCPR2 Utility COM Files)
                        Three ZCPR2 Manuals (Disks 8-10 or hard copy)

                2.  To Modify the ZCPR2 System you need --
                        Disk 1 (ZCPR2 Source)
                        Disks 2-4 (ZCPR2 Utility Sources)
                        Three ZCPR2 Manuals
                        SYSLIB.REL for SYSLIB 2.4
                        Two SYSLIB 2.4 Manuals

                3.  To Fully Implement the ZCPR2 System you  need
--
                        Disk 1 (ZCPR2 Source)
                        Disks 2-4 (ZCPR2 Utility Sources)
                        Disk 5 (ZCPR2 Utility COM Files)
                        Disks 6-7 (ZCPR2 HLP Files)
                        Disks 8-10 (ZCPR2 Manuals)
                        SYSLIB 2.0 (3 Disks)
                        Upgrade to SYSLIB 2.4 (2 Disks)
                        Hardcopy of ZCPR2 Manuals is nice (420 pages)

        Where to get all this stuff?  SIG/M is the only  complete
answer right now.  With LMODEM communication to MIT-MC down right
now, ARPA Net access to the files is  out,  basically,  and  I'll
have  to  check  to  ensure  that  current versions are on MIT-MC
first.  Sol guessed that it will be 4 to 6 weeks before ZCPR2  is
fully  in the SIG/M library, and they are trying to decide how to
deal with hard copy distribution of the manuals, with the idea of
loaning  out  a  manual set to be copied being the key idea right
now.  I am talking to four different companies/agencies  at  this
time to see if anyone is willing to sell ZCPR2 with manuals for a
reasonable price, and I'll keep you posted if anything develops.

It was not bugs in the MC mailer that were causing it to be clogged.

After the first TCP changeover on Jan 1, we found were were getting
many rejections at BRL from hosts that could not yet speak TCP.  At
about that same time, we found that MC was able to speak both the old
(NCP) and new TCP and moved some of the list temporarily back to MC.

However, on Feb 1, the second changeover to TCP only occurred and many
sites were dropped off the net because they do not speak TCP.
Unfortunately, it did not occur to either Keith or myself that we
should have removed those temporary additions at that time.  What then
happened was that this caused a large backup of legitimate queued mail
at MC of which INFO-MICRO and INFO-CPM were a large portion.  ITS has
a primitive file system in some respects, so indeed things did get
clogged to the point where the mailer almost stopped working at all.

So, earlier this week, CSTACY took it upon himself to spend many many
hours clearing out the backlog.  In the process, he blocked the local
redistribution of both INFO-CPM and INFO-MICRO, which included our
temporary sublists - and it was those sublists that were the main
cause of the problems on MC.  Naturally, he could not have been able
to clear the backlog with new mail coming in.

So, I hope that this clears up any misimpressions which may have been
caused by Keith's previous message.

Meanwhile, we are still unable to send to certain sites from BRL, and
this, coupled with problems related to the above discussion, I will
have both mailing lists temporarily shutdown until my own host is up
and checked out for handling mailing lists.  That should be early next
month if all goes as planned.

Please bear with us and accept my apologies to all concerned for any
inconveniences and misunderstandings.

Thanks,
Frank

One exists, written in assembler.  I have an antique version, and it
only runs at 300 or 600 baud reliably.  It's a Ward Christensen original
translation, I believe.  If anybody wants to get a new one, try the
IBM P.C. BBS in Chicago (Schaumburg?  Arlington Heights?) and download
the new .ASM file using your current (8080) version of MODEM.  The
BBS phone number is (312)259-8086.

	Lot s of interest in a modemX program for the 8088.  Thoughrtt I'd send
what I have discovered so far.  Several IBM PC specific bulltetin board
systems around.  I foiund one in Chicago - (312)259-8086 (cute!).  It has
modem.com for the IBM PC as well as modem.asm.  Will pick those up asap
and make available via FTP from my account.  Will also hack >a.asm for
DEC Rainbow and provide that, too.  You can get other IBM PC system
numbers from the Chicago system.  Will also get a list of existing systems
and publish that.  Hold on ...

Ok, I've gone and done it now.  I ordered a 68000 CPU for my Godbout
S-100 system.  With all the banter on the net about CPM-68 lately,
I figured that I'd be able to get something running relatively 
quickly.  The big question is:  does anyone know when (or if)
Godbout/G&G/Compupro/Sorcim will be releasing a CPM-68 BIOS?

In Studio City, California, with J. E. Pournelle and Associates.
Pay is minimum to nothing, and probably not negotiable; however,
there will be some opportunities to earn some outside money.

Duties: evaluate micro computers and software; provide reports
on these.  This will involve learning to use a number of
machines.  Primarily CP/M, but also UCSD Pascal, TPM, possible
TurboDos.  MPM 8/16, Concurrent CPM-86, and CP/M 86.

Languages involve Pascal, Modula II, ADA (subset), CB80 andd
CB-86; possibly others.

Software includes damned near anything pbulished for micro
computers/.

Not m uch programming abiliy required or expected.  It's hoped
some of this will be learned.

What's needed is a gnereral all around assistant senior level or
grad student, interested in working with a whole bunch of micro
computers to get familiarity with them.  Arrangements can be
made with any one of several universities for internship credit.
Pay is low to non-existent because it is unlikely that anyone
starting in this will be worth anything to me, and the total
income  in this evaluation bit isn't large.  However, there are
opportunities to publish for those able to write.

	There are a lot of machiens and software here; more than
can be handled by present staff.  Anyone want to learn a lot
about small machines, some before they are for sale?

Re:   UNIX versions of SQ/USQ and TYPESQ

Finally!  After many problems with FTP, I got the UNIX versions of
the Richard Greewlaw SQUEEZER package over to MIT-MC.  This version
makes files compatible with the CP/M version so if you have UMODEM
working on your UNIX machine you can squeeze files there before
downloading - saving about 30% of your download time!  It's
also useful for archiving ANY ascii files on a UNIX machine
since it reduces the disk storage space by about 30-40% on
most ascii files.

Thanks to Ben Goldfarb for forwarding these programs to me.

The files are on MC as:
  AR43:CPM;XSQ 107C     the squeezer
  AR43:CPM;XUSQ 107C    the unsqueezer
  AR43:CPM;XTYPE 107C   so you can "type" the squeezed files while on UNIX.

Re:   ZCPR2 Status and Release Data

        As I mentioned earlier today, ZCPR2 has been released  as
of  last  Friday, 4 Mar.  I promised more data, so here is a sum-
mary of what is involved in obtaining it.

        First, the size.  ZCPR2, as  I  presented  it  to  SIG/M,
covered  ten  8"  floppy  disks.  In addition, the latest SYSLIB,
Version 2.4, is required to assemble most of the ZCPR2 utilities,
and  the  upgrade covers two more disks.  A hardcopy of the docu-
mentation would also be helpful, and the  five  manuals  which  I
gave  to  SIG/M  total  420  pages (one-sided) and are two inches
thick.

        This sounds like a lot, and it is, but you  do  not  need
all of this to bring ZCPR2 up initially.  To simply bring a ZCPR2
system up, you need the documentation, Disk 1 (which contains the
source  to  ZCPR2, its header file, and a sample redirectable I/O
package), and Disk 5 (which contains COM files of  the  31  ZCPR2
utility  programs and a template around which you can design more
utility programs).  This is only two of the twelve disks.

        The real problem is in the documentation.   Five  manuals
were  released  with  ZCPR2, three of which are required to learn
about ZCPR2 and install it.  These three manuals are:

        1.   The  Installation  Manual.   This  tells  you   what
hardware  and  software is required for installation, how to cus-
tomize ZCPR2 to your liking, how to install ZCPR2 on disk, how to
customize the cold boot routine in the BIOS in order to fully im-
plement ZCPR2, and how to install the utility programs which come
with ZCPR2.  This manual is 48 pages long.

        2.  The Concepts Manual.  This manual is  a  tutorial  on
what ZCPR2 and the ZCPR2 System are, what their key features are,
and how ZCPR2 is intended to be used.  This manual  is  65  pages
long.

        3.  The User's Guide.  This manual is  more  tutorial  on
the  ZCPR2  System,  describing  all the subsystems and utilities
which come as part of the ZCPR2 System.  Included in this  manual
are the redirectable I/O system, the XDIR3 directory utility, the
library utilities, the Menu Subsystem, the file copy utility, the
command file processors, the utilities which manipulate the named
directories, the ZCPR2 resident commands  and  their  alternates,
and  the  online  documentation system.  This manual is 138 pages
long.

        To summarize, two disks and three manuals are required to
first  bring up the ZCPR2 system.  Disks 8, 9, and 10 of the dis-
tribution contain copies of these three manuals in a format  sui-
table for printing by Word Star with MailMerge.  SIG/M also has a
hard copy of the manuals, and they are working on the details  of
how to distribute this.

        The other disks in the ZCPR2 distribution are:

                Disk 2 - Sources to ZCPR2 Utilities assembled by MAC
                Disks 3&4 - Sources to ZCPR2 Utilities assembled
                        by M80/L80 with SYSLIB 2.4
                Disks 6&7 - Help Files; the entire User's Guide is
                        available as online documentation

        There are already three disks in the distribution of SYS-
LIB  2.0,  and  two disks are available which upgrade these three
from 2.0 to 2.4.  These two disks contain a REL  file  of  SYSLIB
2.4,  sources  to all utilities which changed or were added, Help
Files which were changed, and new SYSLIB manuals.  If you wish to
be  able  to reassemble the ZCPR2 utilities, most require M80/L80
and SYSLIB 2.4.

        The other two manuals presented to SIG/M are  the  User's
Guide for SYSLIB 2.3 (fine for use with 2.....4) and the User and Re-
ference Manual for SYSLIB 2.4.

        Summary:

                1.  To Install the ZCPR2 System you need --
                        Disk 1 (ZCPR2 Source)
                        Disk 5 (ZCPR2 Utility COM Files)
                        Three ZCPR2 Manuals (Disks 8-10 or hard copy)

                2.  To Modify the ZCPR2 System you need --
                        Disk 1 (ZCPR2 Source)
                        Disks 2-4 (ZCPR2 Utility Sources)
                        Three ZCPR2 Manuals
                        SYSLIB.REL for SYSLIB 2.4
                        Two SYSLIB 2.4 Manuals

                3.  To Fully Implement the ZCPR2 System you  need
--
                        Disk 1 (ZCPR2 Source)
                        Disks 2-4 (ZCPR2 Utility Sources)
                        Disk 5 (ZCPR2 Utility COM Files)
                        Disks 6-7 (ZCPR2 HLP Files)
                        Disks 8-10 (ZCPR2 Manuals)
                        SYSLIB 2.0 (3 Disks)
                        Upgrade to SYSLIB 2.4 (2 Disks)
                        Hardcopy of ZCPR2 Manuals is nice (420 pages)

        Where to get all this stuff?  SIG/M is the only  complete
answer right now.  With LMODEM communication to MIT-MC down right
now, ARPA Net access to the files is  out,  basically,  and  I'll
have  to  check  to  ensure  that  current versions are on MIT-MC
first.  Sol guessed that it will be 4 to 6 weeks before ZCPR2  is
fully  in the SIG/M library, and they are trying to decide how to
deal with hard copy distribution of the manuals, with the idea of
loaning  out  a  manual set to be copied being the key idea right
now.  I am talking to four different companies/agencies  at  this
time to see if anyone is willing to sell ZCPR2 with manuals for a
reasonable price, and I'll keep you posted if anything develops.

We all like to occassionally guess at the words used to generate
an acronym.  Writing for a widely read magazine, however, you
should verify your guesses before publication.

"MITS" did not stand for Management Information and Text System!

Their original product was telemetry equipment for small rockets
and the company name was "Micro-Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems",
or MITS.  Later, they marketed a portable electronic calculator in
kit form.  The ALTAIR computer kit is their best known product (1975).

Or, is it possible they later changed the company name and you are
right after all?

You should consider looking the the following files on MC:

DSK:CPM;.FILE. (DIR)
lists all the files on the CPM directory.  Files whose names are of the form
ARnn XXXX are really archives, or "subdirectories".  XXXX is chosen to be
descriptive of the contents of the archive.  Files whose names are of the form
TS XXXX are ITS executable files and are of no good to you.  All other files
are potentially interesting for FTP'ing.

ARnn:CPM;.FILE. (DIR)
lists all files in the ARnn archive on the CPM directory.

The advantage of the .FILE. (DIR) files over any CPM DIRLST files is that the
former are ALWAYS correct and fully up to date, as they are maintained by the
operating system.  (These files don't show up in directory listings because
they don't really exist.  They are just a way of asking ITS to make a directory
listing on the spot.)

Can any of you CP/M oldtimers help me???


   I am currently writing a program that crossloads files between
two CP/M-based microcomputers.

I want the "receiving" computer to be able to query itself and
determine how many blocks are left on its own currently loggeed-in
disk(same sort of function as STAT except that the program makes
the call).

I have the Digital Research CP/M 2.0 Interface Guide and found the following:


Function 27:  GET ADDR(ALLLOC)
 Entry parms:
                REG C:   1BH
Returned value:
             REG HL:  ALLOC ADDRESS

--------------------------------------

Function 31:  GET ADDR (DISK PARMS)

  Entry parms:
              REG C:   1FH
Returned value:
            REG HL: DPB ADDRESS
______________________________________

I don't understand "what" is at those addresses (pointed to by the HL regs)
when I call these functions.

Any idea where the terms-
    ALLOC ADDRESS
    DPB ADDRESS
are explained? Or what they mean?


ANY AND ALL HELP WOULD BE GREATLY APPRECIATED.

                                   Sincerely,
                                    Tom

Does anyone have any recommendations on accounting programs.  I need GL,
AR, AP and possibly inventory and I have on the order of 50 transactions
each day.  In particular do all or any of the accounting programs
produce intermediate files that I can process with programs that I write

I thought I had seen a review of a set of such programs once, but in looking
through my past InfoWorlds and Bytes I don't see much.

Ben,

I'm seriously considering the purchase of an S-100 computer system for home
use.  I am interested in keeping up my skills by doing programming at home to
do things which I don't have time to do at work (things like testing
new/different algorithms, learning new languages, etc.). 

     I noticed that you have a CompuPro system and I am interested in learning
about some of it's features.  I just ordered the RAM-16 memory from Priority One
because it does the things I think I'll need (10MHz, 8/16 bits)....  Can you tell me
something about the CP/M system for it.  For the time being I'm interested in the
8 bit world since I've already got the software.  16+ bits may come later, so I
want to be able to upgrade in the future.  Thank you very much.

     Any one else (info-cpm) may feel free to respond about the CompuPro
system or any alternatives which you have found to be of good quality and
reliable.

Tracy.

Compupro stuff is indeed quality S-100 gear, and it seems to be very
reliable.  We have the 8085/8088 cpu board, the disk1 floppy controller,
the ram 21, and the system support board.  It all worked the first try.

On the negative side, the disk 1 has a bad feature in that it unloads
the drive heads very very frequently.  If you have become used to a
properly done system which lets a number of revolutions go by before
unloading the head, the compupro system will annoy you greatly.  If
flaps the heads up and down incessantly, and as a result, it introduces
delays that make it run considerably slower.  For example, a Z80 runing
at 4 MHz with Jade controller runs a particular disk-bound program
in 11 mins and 15 seconds.  The compupro running the 8085 at 6 MHz
runs the same program in 14 minutes and 47 seconds.  It OUGHT to be
faster due to the faster cpu clock rate, but is much slower due to
the idiotic way they handle the head loading.  The worst part, though,
is the noise of listening to the thing beating its brains out.

Godbout is well aware of the problem, and will only say that the 
next version of the disk 1 will have it fixed.

They claim to be working on an automatic cpm86/cpm80 switching
scheme similar to G&G engineering's MPM8-16 which will make the
8085/8088 board much easier to use for those of us who need to
use both systems while developing software for the 8086/88.  Tis
said to be ready in a few weeks.  The G & G scheme really works very
well, and saves a lot of disk changing.  You can use all your old
favorite 8-bit tools, like wordmaster, for general work, then
automatically run the 16-bit stuff.  They use the difference between
.COM and .CMD file names to do the switching.  If godbout does as good
a job as g & G did, it will be nice.
Good luck.

This is really a burden and does discourage one from sending

A recent message of mine to the lists received over 25 failure

My question is this:  why not add an option in the mail header
to simply dump the message into the communications wasteland
if it is undeliverable.  Something like the NOQC option at MIT

I am looking for information about the boot ROM on the TRS-80 model II,
specifically:

  -- When the system boots, which sectors of the floppy disk in drive A
     are read into which locations in memory?

  -- What is the "Radio Shack format" for which the boot ROM checks
     before it branches to the booted code?  Presumably this involves
     a checksum somewhere.

This data is needed for an effort to customize CP/M for the model II.
(Yes, I know Pickles & Trout make a great system, but they don't
distribute source for their BIOS and there are some additional features
that I've *got* to build.)  If noone has the answers, you'll find me
inside the machine with a flashlight, disassembling the 2k ROM (sigh).

Does anyone have or know someone who has an Epson QX-10 personal computer?
I will be beta testing one very soon.  I am interested in an informal
user forum on the net.

  By the looks of it, this machine offers some very interesting capabilities.
The Nec 7220 GDC chip is by far the most interesting component on board.
After having just completed a review of the chip for the April issue of BYTE,
I am anticipating a great deal of enjoyment with the 10.  The system is said
to have the NAPLPS graphics standard implimented.  It may not be that hard to
install GSX-Kernal (DRI's new device independant graphics software) on the
machine.  I understang there is full DMA capabilities built in.  The disks
are half-height 5 1/4" 360kbytes with dma i/o.  The graphics have 128k bytes
of ram, the system 128k also.  This opens up possibilities for running banked
CP/M+.  I've seen some of these already at the developers facility.  They are
being programmed with numerous features in order to increase it's competitive
edge in the current market.  Apparently, Epson is going after LISA. This should
not be too difficult, considering the astronomic price asked by the 'BOSS'.
(Apple).  It will only be a matter of time before a 68K, 8088, and possibly a
6502 (apple ][ emulation?) add-on board is offered for the 10.

  I think there will be lots of discussion of this new box in the near
futute.

The ROM reads in track 0 sectors 1 to 26 into memory starting
at 0E00H. The track is in standard IBM single density. The
way the ROM checks for a "Radio Shack Operating System" being
on the disk is to check for the word "BOOT" at 1000H and
"DIAG" at 1400H. If these two words are present at these
locations the ROM assumes the boot track is ok. After loading
the track into memory the ROM will call 1404H (to do power on
diagnostics) and then jump to 1004H (to boot the rest of the
system). Disassembly of the ROM is easy. I have listings of
boot ROMs for Models II, 12, and 16 and a program to make it
easy to get a copy of the ROM on disk. If interested in this
program or a copy of the listings, let me know.

I am supposed to give a speec at NCC on "The Next Five Years in

and no doubt become an article as well.

Still, help will be appreciated: any wild ideas greatefully
accepted.  All entries become property of the sponsors and none
will be returned...

I see a few trends.  I expect 8" and 5 1/4" floppies will both
die away, in not very long.  Non-volatile memory will get cheap
and plentiful.  Shirt pocket disks will be used to transfer
stuff fro  publisher to user.  Interesting trends in visuals and
displays.  T he "battle" between 68000 and 8086 family will be
interesting, although the 16032 may decide t hat before the
battle is really joined...

Communications and information utilities will move ahead..

anyway, ideas and wild thoughts will be appreciated.

PS: does anyone know where the profits from NCC go?  (I know it
is a non-profit outfit that puts it on, but since it must make a
LOT LOT LOT of money, where does the money go?)

PPS:   They say they cannot allow anyone to sell anything in the
exhibits because of their non-profit status because the IRS will
stop them; but in fact that's owl puckey.  Science fiction
conventions have for decades been  non-profit (some incorporated
some not)  and they have always had a huckster room in which
exhibitors sell stuff, and indeed also art auctions and what
not.  Query: why does NCC maintain this fiction of being unable
to sell anything or allow anythin g to be sold?  Qui bono?

Jerry...

	Your question regarding where does conference money go is one I may
be able to handle in general.  In the IEEE, conferences usually generate more
money than expenses.  The excess funds are divided per apriori agreement
to the suborganizations to aid them in their continuing functions.  Member
ship dues come nowhere near providing all the funds needed to support the
IEEE in its many activities.  In fact, the IEEE struggles each year to break
even.  Thus, the money is put to good use.  As an example, the Design
Automation Technical Committee, of which I am the chairman, is a technical
committee responsible for all design automation activities within the IEEE
Computer society.  We sponsor two major conferences a year (the Design
Automation Conference, and the International Conference on Computer Design),
and about 5 workshops each year.  Excess funds from these conferences are
distributed to the Computer Society and the DATC to fund a yearly scholorship,
provide funds to set these conferences up, and pay for newsletter publishing
and distribution.

	This is a long-winded way to say that I suspect the IFIPs does pretty
much the same.  It takes money to run such an organization, and conferences 
are one way to obtain it.  By the way, the IEEE does *NOT* hold conferences
to make money!  But our conferences are typically attended better than our
(conservative) estimate.

I have a QX-10.  The software is unfinished, and it wouldn't be
fair to air my views of it widely until they've had a a chance
to fix some of the problems and act on m y suggestions.  The NET
is broken and I cannot send long messages due to the high
frustration factor..  I can't download anything either.  I
wouldn't mind seeing your review of the chip; can you cause Pam
to send me an early copy?
	They did many  things right on the Qx-10, but I doubt
the wisdom of not haing a full ASCII character set, and I
particularly wonder why there is no ESCAPE key; (there is, but
they call it "margin release", and it's in the wrong place, not
up in the upper left hand corner where everyone expects it)
(well it is there, but separated by a gap; could be it will be
all right; but there is no squiggle or grave or curly braces.
The control key(s) is/are placed a bit strangely too.  still, I
could get used to it, and if I had a guarantee that there'd be a
real 68000 cpu to add, as well as a way to connect to hard
disks, and perhaps some way to plug into 8" disks in order to
get software over to it, I'd plan on the QX-10 becoming a major
part of the system here.  With that non-standard bus inside it,
and nothing (that I have) on what will go i nthere, one doesn't
want to plan for too much.  If they get their software done, and
IF they make provisions for people to use it after they become
competent, instead of their present system in which everything
is easily understood by very naive users, but will drive you
nuts once you know how to work it--given those if's, it is one
heck of a nice m achine, and I suspect  potentially better than
LISA--and one heck of a lot cheaper.
	There's a port on the back for a light pen, although no
p en and no software for that yet.  It's a 4 wire socket, wonder
if they could put a mouse on there?

Whether or not Epson decides to supply a mouse for the QX-10, you can expect
to see a lot of mice available once people get to know them as well as we do here
at Xerox.

Mice make light pencils, joysticks and other control devices seem like quaint
toys.  Apple made a good move in introducing the mouse to the micro market.

	I have umodem ver. 3.1 up on a version 7 UNIX system, but
it will not run under System III.  Is there a System III version
of umodem available?

Thanks,

Is there a quick assembly language code routine to find out the
total number of bytes on a disk?

2.  H ow do you get the names of all the files, and their size,
off a disk in cp/m?  TYo make, say, a disk file of all those
entiries on the disk, and their file sizes?

thanks,

Look at the DIR.ASM program in the January Dr. Dobbs Journal.  It has a
routine that does all of that stuff. It is mostly right.

	There is an absence of well-known software for the 6502 other
than Apple/Commodore, however having recently been employed as the lead 
system programmer for Scientific Data Systems (take 2), I can verify the 
existence of a rather good operating system, functioning Ethernet-like local
net, and very good database management software for a 6502 based system.  
There are also C compilers available.  I tried to make the SDS DOS a Unix 
ookaliketo some extent, but was unable to convince others there of the
importance of such an effort.  The NIH syndrome was widespread.
They are still building only 6502-based systems so I doubt that
they will become any more widely known.  The 6502 does provide
the opportunity for a relatively standard coding style - ie.
simple and consistent use of registers.  This can make it easier
to read than code for other processors.  

	Bill

There are a large number of public domain cpm programs that do
what you want...just look through the CPM; directory on
MC for directory programs in assembler.  You might want to
check SD.

Two public domain programs that come to mind are SD and XDIR. The
latter is part of the new ZCPR2 package and is available on MC on one
of the FJW archives (AR80, AR81, or AR82); the former is in the CPM
directory. Look at CPM;CPM DIRLST for a pointer to it. If you need
more specific info on either, feel free to ask..

        The library I just released to SIG/M  (SYSLIB  2.4)  con-
tains  many  assembly  language  routines  for doing the kinds of
things you are interested in.  To be exact, there  are  130  rou-
tines  in  the  library which deal with the disk, math functions,
sorting, ZCPR2, and other topics.  Source code is  available  for
everything if you want to study it.

        In answer to your  first  question  (about  finding  free
space  on  a  disk), yes.  The SDIR.MAC module of SYSLIB 2.4 con-
tains a routine called DFREE which returns  the  number  of  free
bytes  (in  K) on a disk.  You just call DFREE after logging into
the desired disk, and it returns this value in  the  DE  register
pair.  The source code for this routine is under 2 pages in size,
and it works for any CP/M 2.2 system.

        Re your second question (accessing directory  info),  the
SDIR.MAC  module  also  has  routines  to do this.  DIRLOAD loads
basic file info on all files on your disk into a  memory  buffer,
and DIRSLOAD does the same as DIRLOAD but includes necessary info
to compute file sizes and  runs  slightly  slower  as  a  result.
These  are  far  more complex than DFREE, and they are documented
(along with all the SYSLIB 2.4 routines) in the SYSLIB.HLP  files
on  MC  and  the SYSLIB documents.  Workman should have a copy of
the SYSLIB documents and the ZCPR2 documents by now, and you  can
get the interface info from him.

One note -- XDIR for ZCPR2 derives all of its power from SYSLIB 2.4,
calling the routines in the SDIR module.  The source to XDIR gives
an example of how to call those routines, but the documentation on SYSLIB
2.4 is (hopefully) clear on this matter also.

AR19:CPM on MIT-MC contains HLP and REL files to SYSLIB 2.1.  2.4
isn't   up yet,  and  I  doubt  if the source will come online at
MC because there is so much to it (2 disks and 80+ files).   When
White Sands comes  online,  it  is  likely that it will be there.
Don't know when White Sands will come on  line,  tho.   You  will
probably   find  all of ZCPR2 there as well when it does (from my
understanding).

All of this is in SIG/M (both ZCPR2 and SYSLIB 2.4), but I don't
know the volume numbers yet.

I have been impressed with the way North Star has "enhanced" 
CP/M 2.2 for the NS Advantage by adding calls for graphics 
and such.  Is anyone knows to be taking advantage (sorry) of 
the additions to write good graphics for the Adv?  Games?  
Canned packages of .rel subroutines?  I'm interested in 
public domain material, but also in material for sale.

What's the most inclusive, comprehensive listing of CP/M software 
available?  Does it include both public domain and for-sale 
material?

I will send collected responses to anyone who asks.

Yes, distribution versions will be in AR80  to  AR82:FJW.   Right
now,  ZCPR2  itself and its header are the dist versions, as well
as the Rationale Manual.   I  believe  the  HLP  files  are  also
correct,  and  intend  to  check the COM files (via CRCs) to make
sure they are also up to date and will update any  which  aren't.
The  rest  of  the  manuals  will be placed there sometime, but I
don't know when yet.

I'll send a message to INFO-CPM after everything has been checked
and uploaded.

I have placed the following files on MC:

		     LU 210HEX (for those who cannot FTP binary files)
		     LU 210DOC

These new files represent an upgraded version of Library Utility,
written in BDS C by Gary Novosielski. This utility allows a number of
files on a CP/M disk to be strung together into one large file for
archiving purposes. LRUN, also on AR29, allows a .COM file to be loaded
and executed directly from a library.

NOTES:

1. Call-back systems are those where a computer and real people
   share the same telephone line.   To contact the people, just
   dial  &  let the phone ring until you  get  an  answer.   To
   contact  the  computer:   (1) dial,  (2) let the phone  ring
   once,  (3) hang up just before the 2nd ring,  & (4) re-dial. 
   Call  back systems are noted as CB,  systems  not  requiring 
   call back are noted as NCB.

2. Baud rates are shown as Bx, where x is a code indicating:
     1= pmmi rates (110-710 baud) ; 2 = 300 baud only
     3= Bell 212A and 300 baud    ; 4 = Vadic 3451 and 300 Baud
     5= Bell 212A,Vadic 3451 and 300 Baud.
   Note  that  the  212A/Vadic  1200 baud  modems  may  not  be   
   compatable with yours. Most of the above systems are   using 
   Vadic  3451 Triple modems,  compatable with both Bell    and 
   Vadic  Standard.  Sign  on  the first time at  300  baud  to   
   determine  the  system capabilities.  Note also that  PMMI's   
   can sometimes be used over 300 baud with 1200 baud  systems.   
   PMMI baud rates are: 110, 300, 450, 600, 710.

3. Alternate Long Distance servies are shown as LDx, where x is 
   a code indicating:
     1= None   2=Sprint   3=MCI   4=ITT
   Whether  a  program  exchange  system is  accessible  by  an   
   a.l.d.s. (=alternative long-distance service) should be con-   
   sidered when planning to modem over long  programs.  Charges   
   on  SPRINT,  ITT/CITYCALL  and MCI are 50-60% of  Ma  Bell's   
   regular long distance rates.

4. Disk  capacity is shown for reference.   Note that disks not 
   noted as HARD may be any combination of floppies,  and  that 
   hard  disks  are generally divided into a number of  logical 
   disks.   Check  the system documentation for  exact  details 
   when logging on.

5. All times listed are local time.

6. NEW SYSOPS: When messaging Jud or Kim with information about
   your system, please include the following data:

   a. Your System's Name (& BBS type)
      (examples: Joe Blow's RBBS, Home Town RCPM/CBBS)
   b. Your System's area code and phone number.
   c. Your Name.
   d. Call Back/No Call Back.
   e. Hours of operation.
   f. Baud rates supported.
   g. Alternative Long Distance Services that can call you.
      (Note that you don't have to subscribe to any, just list
       ones that can call your area.   If you don't know, call
       the local  MCI, SPRINT and/or ITT  offices or their 800
       number and ask 'em.)
   h. Your on-line storage capacity. (Total KB or MB).
   i. Your location. (City, State; State, Area)
   j. Special features and interests, hardware notes, etc.

It  will  greatly  assist  Jud and Kim if  you  can  modem  the 
information  in  a format similar to those already existing  in 
the current listing.

Jerry,

    I would sure be interested in seeing if you get a decent answer to
your inquiry.   I am trying to write a procedure that will query the disk
for remaining space, determine if enough space is present, and write to 
the disk.

   I'm pretty new to the game...still learning much of the CP/M 
vocabulary.

  If you have the time, your effort would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,
Tom

Terrific!  I called Priority 1 this morning to ask when CPM-68
would be available for Godbout/CompuPro systems and the answer
was, "six months from now."  So I guess I can play tiddly-winks
with the 68K board until then.

But seriously, given a cross-assembler (which I'd either write 
or purchase), how easy or difficult wo it be for someone who
has a lot of CBIOS experience with CPM-80 and CPM-86 to write
a BIOS and install CPM-68 using a CPM-80 or CPM86 system as the
development machine?  I'm particularly interested in comments 
from those who have actually done the job (mknox@utexas-11 et al).

Also, does anyone know the chance of getting one of these so-called
beta versions that everyone saw running on CompuPro stuff at CPM-83?

Could someone please give me breifly the current state of Mince or Final
Word?  What is the difference? Is the package containing BDS C still
available? If so, is the BDS C the current version?
