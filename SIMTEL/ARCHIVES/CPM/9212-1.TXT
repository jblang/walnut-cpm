Ive got an old 5-5 that seems to have a bad power supply. When I power
it on, the floppy drive does this real nifty clicking noise, and the
hard drive doesnt seem to spin up. I get nothing on the console. Does
anyone happen to have prints of this power supply?

Thanx

Subject: Micro Solutions, UniForm and UniDOS

Having been inspired by a recent posting, and additionally being a
resident of DeKalb, I visited Micro Solutions yesterday with my
old UniForm and UniDOS disks in hand.  I had purchased a Kaypro II
from them back in '83 or '84, and later, when I bought a DOS machine,
purchased UniForm and UniDOS.  He had a bit of a problem upgrading
my copy of UniForm, though--he said my original master disk was so
old they weren't able to write to it!  He also said that the Z80
interpreter mode of UniDOS is no longer supported, and mentioned
something about a Z80 coprocessor board being their current
supported method of CP/M emulation on DOS machines.

To make a short story long, my new(er) versions of UniForm and
UniDOS seem to work fine on DOS 5.0.  I ran some programs directly
from a Kaypro floppy with no problems (MBASIC, NSWEEP, and VDO).
Turbo Pascal v2.0 "sort of" worked; the editor worked fine, and
the compiler compiled MicroCalc, but the latter bombed with a
run-time error when I tried to run it.  Best of all, a couple of
the compiled games included on the Kaypro II BASIC disk, LADDER
and CATCHUM, worked quite nicely.  My old BASIC programs worked
fine, too.  The speed (on a 386SX 25) was comparable to my old
Kaypro II.  Note that Turbo Pascal is the closest to a "heavy-duty"
program that I've tried.  I still have my Perfect Writer disks,
but I haven't tried it yet.

I've only run into one minor glitch with UniForm:  it isn't aware
that you might be using a LOADHI(GH) program to load it in
CONFIG.SYS.  If you do, and you try to run UINSTALL, it will claim
that UniForm is not installed on your system, and proceed to add
a (redundant) DEVICE= command to CONFIG.SYS.  It's easy to trick
it, though--keep a standard DEVICE=\path\UNIFORM.SYS in your
CONFIG.SYS, but make it a REMark.  When you want to run UINSTALL
to change your configuration, or run UNIFORM.EXE to change
disk formats, remember to uncomment this line beforehand.
UNIFORM.SYS itself runs fine loaded high.  Happily, both programs
run fine under DESQview v2.40.  This means that I can have a
DESQview window with UniDOS loaded for running my CP/M programs.
In fact, I should be able to run multiple UniDOS windows
simultaneously.

In conclusion, let me say that Micro Solutions *does* seem to
have a sense of history.  Right on the showroom floor it is easy
to see a machine that looks almost exactly like my Kaypro II
except that it is painted "KAYCOMP II".  If I remember correctly
this was the originalname of the Kaypro II (right?).  One of the
salesmen said they still use it from time to time.

Subject: Need system disks for TRS-80 Model 4P
Message-ID: <1dmgmbINN1mt@agate.berkeley.edu>

I've adopted another orphan.  This time it's a TRS-80 Model 4P.
Unfortunately, the system disks that I got with the machine are
trashed.  Therefore I'm looking for...

A TRSDOS 6 boot disk (with appropriate utilities) for running in
model 4 mode.

An earlier TRSDOS boot disk (for running in Model 3 mode).

and

A CP/M system disk (with the transient commands) for running CP/M.

I will, of course, pay media and shipping costs.

Now if I could just find someone willing to sell me a Model 16
for the same price, my "orphan museum" would be off to a good start.

Subject: televideo 806/20 with ts
Message-ID: <1992Nov19.4443.3178@dosgate>

Willi, I have a TS806 with a TS800A.

I don't bother using Mmmost with it. Instead, I just run it as a
single-user system with CP/M-80. Actually, I run NZCOM, the automated
Z-system product.

Easiest way to attach the TSS800A to the TS806 and get it running
is to use the RS232 connections. Connect a standard RS232 cable from
the connection marked TERMINAL at the back of the TS806 to the
connection marked P1(RS232) on the back of the TS800A.

I won't talk about dipswitch settings on the TS800A, will assume
whoever sold it to you left them at the correct settings.

Once the connections are made, just power on both boxes. If the
TS806 doesn't autoboot, push the little red reset button near the
floppy drive.

There are several very experienced TS806 users on this net; I'm
sure you'll receive other replies!

The Apple Lisa was, simplistically, a product ahead of its time. One might 
say that it was the first Macintosh. In fact, a number of them were sold in 
the late 1980's as a cheap machine which would run Mac software.

I suggest that you seek a Macintosh forum in which to ask further questions.

Message-ID: <1992Dec4.175522.12346@mlb.semi.harris.com>

Hello,
I subscribed to this group because I use to be a moderate CPM user.  The communication
going on seemed quite interesting.  For an OS that came out in the 70's, it has 
survived quite well.  Now to the point, I have a DECMate 2 computer.  This is a PDP-8
computer (uses a single VLSI chip instead of several boards) with an APU (auxillary
processor unit) installed.  This APU is a Z80 micro based card with 64 Kbytes of memory
installed.  This allows me to run CPM 2.2.  My problem is that I cannot format disks.
I have to buy them and they don't exist any more.  DEC did funny things with this 
computer and did not provide all the utilities needed.  I have tried to write a format
routine but to no avail.  The Z80 code offloads the disk functions to the PDP-8 which
in turn controls the 8272 disk controller chip.  If you have any help or maybe would
like to buy/swap this computer let me know via email.

  Hello Guys

  I have worked for a year and a half on QX-10 and 16 before leaving the 
school where I was teaching.  At that time, I gave away 3 QX-10, 2 QX-16
2 20 Mb hard disks and all the original technical documentation.  Had to do
that as I was leaving the country and could not afford to take them along.
  In the US, I enquired about QXs for the good times sakes, and came up
with those two addresses:

   Star Technology Corporation
   900 Road 170
   Carbondale, CO 81623     (303)963-1969

     I found their prices much too high ( $679 for a 20 Mb, 65 ms 
   hard disk )

   SnyderScope International
   1594 Hilltop Drive
   El Cajon, CA 92020-8227  (619)442-2299

     SnyderScope was in the process of closing its QX interests in 1991, so
   I don't know if they might be of help.  They might be kind and give you
   a few tips on how to hack a QX to MFM or RLL interface so that you can 
   use a regular DOS drive.

  Happy hacking

	I would recommend "The Programmer's CP/M Handbook" by Thom Hogan,

Subject: Amstrad Z-80 laptop.
Message-ID: <1992Dec6.000735.15374@cs.umb.edu>

A couple of weeks ago, someone posted an article to this newsgroup regarding
an Amstrad laptop computer with a Z-80 chip in it.

Does anyone know if Amstrad is really coming out with such a model?  I tried
to locate Amstrad on Internet, and they are not.

Thanks.

f you have access to a PC with an appropriate floppy drive, you might get
a copy of Sydex AnaDisk program and use its Copy function to duplicate an
already formatted - but blank - disk.  The registration fee is quite 
reasonable, and will be soon paid by using generic floppies.

There must be a misunderstanding.
You probably refer to the AMSTRAD PPC-640 or PPC-512, a MessDoss PORTABLE,
not Laptop, not CP/M.
It's essentially an XT clone, with 512 or 640 K RAM, one or two 3in1/2
diskettes (720k capacity each), a 2400 bauds modem with the PPC 640, a hardly
tolerable display which needs light in your back, and a 10 (is it 8 ?) MHz
8086 processor. There is a 8087 socket, and connectors for an external
printer, display (CGA or mono), a serial port and a complete XT-bus extension.
Some outlets used to offer an external hard disk.
It runs from an external power supply or 10 1.5 volt alkaline batteries.
Its volume/weight is 2-3 times a laptop, the only advantage is that you have
a full size 101 keys keyboard with desktop layout. I used it in trains (fresh
batteries held 2/3 of the 3h30 trips Paris<-->Geneva only), but too large in
a  plane. Bottom line, if somebody wants to purchase mine...(640k, 2 drives).

The Software Bridge product allows conversion from Wordstar 3.3 to Microsoft

supports Wordstar to MS Word conversion in the Convert program that is

I don't have any information on a product that would convert CP/M disks to

I realize this is a fairly quiet place lately, but I thought
what I found in my basement the other day would be interesting to
some of you.

I used to make and sell the Ztime-I calendar/clock board for
Z80 based computers.  The board adds a battery backed clock chip
to almost any Z80 computer.  The board is a daughter card that
goes under the CPU.

Anyway, I found a few spare circuit boards in a box the other day.
Needless to say they haven't been selling like hot-cake for the last
five years.  If anyone is interested in these things, drop me
a note or give me a call.  They are just taking up space that newer
junk sorely needs.

Many years ago, BYTE published a two-article series showing how to build a
simple SCSI host adapter for S-100.  The second article gave an outline of
driver software.  The host adapter was little more than a parallel port and
addressing logic, since the disk drive's control was quite autonomous.

Did anyone out there follow this up, and would it be worth re-doing? (I could
dig out the article, but my BYTEs are at home, and this was probably c.1981.)

How about a modern redux with IDE? Those drives are pretty good value now,
and the interface is probably dirt-simple.  (I'm just a simple M.E., so I
may be deluding myself here.)

BTW, anyone want to dicker for 180+ old issues of BYTE?  Includes No.1 and
most of the first 10 years, but sadly I've lost No.2 and a few others.
(List on request)  This is a genuine offer, but we're talking serious
kilograms here!  I haven't figured the best way to offer them, and I'm
afraid my attic will cave in! [;->)

I have uploaded to SIMTEL20:

pd1:<msdos.emulators>
ZSIM20.ZIP      Z80 emulator + CP/M 80 bios to RUN CP/M
                            
ZSIM is an (extremely accurate) Z80 emulator (80386/40 -> 8 MHz Z80)
in conjunction with a CP/M 80 bios, i.e. it simulates a Z80 machine, 
that can run CP/M. Together with the original CP/M operating system 
you have a full Z80-CP/M machine.
If you don't have a CP/M system disc at hand, you can use the included 
public domain CP/M compatible operating system SUPERDOS.
ZSIM uses CP/M format discs and a ramdisc.  Supported disc formats 
are CP/M 86 single sided and double sided, but you can install any CP/M 
format PC drives can physically read. So you can use ZSIM to transfer 
data to MS-Dos.  The ramdisc can be saved to the PC harddisc.  
A sample ramdisc containing the SMALL-C compiler is included.
As ZSIM uses an original operating system and CP/M discs it should run 
every CP/M program that does not use special hardware.  All software I 
could test ran.
ZSIM is free for personal use.  Sources of the CP/M bios are included.
NEW IN VERSION 2.0:
* emulation is 20 % faster
* Z80 interrupt handling fully emulated
* a powerful utility to transfer data from CP/M to MS-Dos included
* IOByte support, so you can access your serial port
* the z80 emulation can be linked to your own programs with C interface

	Greets CP/M folks... I bought a broken Osborne Exec and finally
fixed it last weekend... problem is I don't have the software for it...
I have one disk that boots CP/M 3.0 so I know the thing works well, but
the rest of that disk is supercalc files... I can't even make another
system disk!! Can anyone out there help me out?

Subject: Porting CP/M
Message-ID: <1992Dec4.004641.27595@murdoch.acc.Virginia.EDU>

I have a question for those of you who have put CP/M onto a homebrewed
machine. Unfortunately, our university library has only 1 text on
CP/M and it is pretty much fluff with only hints at the insides so I
haven't been able to work this out for myself.

Apparently older peripherals, circa mid to late '70s, had less of a standard
logical interface than those currently in use.  Thus, BIOS was generally
not found in ROM (since this would only fit a given manufactures combination
of peripherals) and most folks rolled their own.  This, anyways, is the
claim of the text that I have.

While writing a device driver is no big deal, just tedious, it seems that
most people back then putting together a motherboard from here and a
disk driver from there, etc., were faced with a real 'chicken and egg'
problem.  Developing device drivers is all well and good when you
have a system to do it on, but you didn't have a system until you had a
bootable disk with the correct drivers.

So, what piece of the puzzle has my lack of adequate information left
me without?  How did those of you who put together your own system back
then handle this problem?

I'm curious because I'm putting together an old IMSAI as a 'just for fun'
project and I would like to get CP/M running on it.  I suppose I could
whip up an emulator for the IMSAI and my particular combination of peripherals
and get a floppy for the IMSAI compatible with my usual machine so that
I could get CP/M running and build a bootable diskette, but this seems
somewhat round about.

I'd like suggestions from others who have put one of these systems together
before. (other than to get a decent manual, I'm working on that ;-)

Thanks,

Steve

Much more recently (Jan/Feb 1991) TCJ (The Computer Journal) published 
an article on how to build a very simple SCSI port.  It was just a 8255, 
and some decoding logic.  The handshaking was mostly done in software, 
except for the ACK signal which was generated by a flip-flop.  I've had 
a quick hack board made from this circuit running on my Z80 machine for 
the past 15 months without any problems.  Transfer speed is limited to 
whatever you can persuade your machine to do in software - about 45K/s 
for my 4 Mhz 1WS Amstrad.  I've been talking about adding DMA support to 
it for a while.  I might have a go at it over the Christmas break.

This was done even more recently in TCJ (Jun/Jul 1992 I think).  It 
mostly just turned a single 8 bit port into a 16 bit port by 
multiplexing.  It apparently works quite well.  It was connected to a 
board based on a 16Mhz Z280, and I think it used the built in DMA, so 
transfer speed would have been good.  There was some software (basic) 
with it too.

It's time for me to make space for a new generation of computers, 
so I have to part with my old reliable, easy to understand, 8-bit computer.
I'm asking $300 for all of it, including the CP/M texts and the BYTE,
MicroSystems Journal, and S-100 magazines.
I'd like to sell it all as a unit, but will consider parting it out after a few
weeks if no reasonable offers are received.
It is currently plugged in and running with no known problems.

Message-ID: <1992Dec14.033217.13185@nemesis.orchard-park.ny.us>

I guess I woke some of you old die-hard Z80 folk up with my posting
on my left-over Ztime-I calendar/clocks.  If I don't reply individually,
it's because I was swamped with requests on information.  (for you folks
that sounded desparate, you should have gotten a call or Email)

Anyway, here's the scoop:

I have 15 bare circuit boards left for the Ztime-I.  The features
of the Ztime-I are:

- Under Z80 CPU installation
- Adds 32 I/O ports that provide the date/time in BCD
- Maintains time from "coin" battery.
- Simple to build from good/detailed instructions.
- Complete driver software to set/get time from chip in C, Pascal, and Basic.
- All parts can be ordered from DigiKey.

If you send me a check for $15 a board, I'll send you a bare circuit card,
a copy of the manual, and a 5 1/4" disk with the driver software.  If all
you need is a bare board, then the price is $10/board.  This includes shipping
to North America.

I hope this answers all your questions.  I also beg for forgiveness from
any of you that hate commercial "Exploitation" of Usenet.

If you've got an IBM clone and if the IMSAI uses double densitiy 5,25"
discs you can use the ZSIM Z80 Emulator from SIMTEL.
It can boot and run the original CP/M from a CP/M disc.

Subject: PC/Blue
Message-ID: <WANCHO.12838020014.BABYL@WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL>

Mark,

The PC/Blue collection started out as a collection of CP/M programs
that were converted to run on the early IBM PCs.  This was at the time
the IBM PCs had just come out on the market and there was little to no
software, either public domain or commercial to run on them.  Because
most of the CP/M programs were written in an assembly language, such
as M80 or ASM, to fit within a max 56K address space, conversion
initially meant running the source code through an ASM-80 to ASM-86
translator.  The results were mostly usable, but far from efficient.

That inefficiency spawned a small market in Baby Blue cards, which, as
I recall, were single slot Z80 computers designed to run in an IBM PC
machine.  You could run your CP/M programs full tilt, usually much
faster than the translated version.  This resulted in the temporary
impression that the native IBM PC (at 4.77MHz) was much slower that
its Z80/Z80H counterparts, and, they were, until programs written in
native ASM-86 were developed, specially designed to take full
advantage of the 8088/8086 architecture.

The PC/Blue collection then became THE vehicle for the distribution of
public domain and the new category of shareware (also called begware
by dyed-in-the-wool CP/Mers who would never think of asking for money
for their masterpieces).  Nonetheless, the PC/Blue name stuck, in
spite of the fact that it went far beyond its original purpose.

For those of you who still remember, the PC/Blue collection was
originally available on the net from SIMTEL20, going back to 1983.  It
was removed at a time when we were severely short on disk space and
preferred to devote the space to the ever expanding MSDOS collection.
Besides, the PC/Blue collection had grown to over 600 volumes, with a
large percentage of newer and newer versions of previously released
packages (witness the modem programs "wars").  In other words, a lot
of self-duplication, and redundancy with the MSDOS collection, which
had the policy of keeping only the latest versions of much of the same
software packages.  (Also, the MSDOS collection was usually several
months ahead of the PC/Blue releases, which suffered severe latencies
due to daisy-chain surface mail and copying delays at each link.

By the time we got disk space elbow room, we had to remove the
"entertainment" (games) as a matter of policy and stick to carrying
only the justifiable packages.  Because the PC/Blue collection
contained "games" and because we would only carry canned packages
as-is, we did not restore the PC/Blue collection to online status,
deferring to the mirror sites.

Message-ID: <921216113357.TARKA10@BUFVA.BITNET>

Two questions.

1.  I have two line-printers from an old Mohawk Data Sciences computing
system.  Both self-test OK, but I can't find the correct
communications protocol to make the connection between my Digital
Rainbow and the first, and can't even find where to attach the data
cable on the second.

                (i)     Mfgr:  QUANTEL (Hayward, CA)
                        Mod. No.:  5129

                (ii)    TERMINET
                        Mfgr.:  General Electric (Waynesboro, VA)
                        Mod. No.  383400YB0009A1

I need to know if these are serial or parallel, and how to set-up
communications.

2.  Just as a general question, what is PCBLUE?  I have a listing of
available software from Oakland.Edu.  I've sort of got the idea that the
programs were derived from software written for say an IBM, but will
work on any system with the appropriate CPU (something about hardware
addresses being different); there was a brief statement in conversation
or reading associated with the Rainbow, that it had the capability to
read IBM disks, but was otherwise incompatable with IBM and its clones.

Any information on either or both of these topics would be appreciated.

Several attempts to reply directly to "reynaert@arizona.edu" have failed with
a "user unknown" message from the host, so I will post my response here.

   This is a very well known problem with Kaypro computers.  It is the
result of a poor design of the video display.  When a new line must be
created at the bottom of the screen and the existing lines have to be
scrolled up, the system takes so long that incoming characters are lost.  I
don't use a Kaypro myself, but many friends do.  There is a file that
implements a correction to this (I can't remember exactly what it does or
how it does it).  A common work around is to clear the screen every time it
fills up and to start again from the top.  If you don't get more specific
advice from others who reply to you, get back to me and I will try to dig up
that file for you.  It is posted on my BBS system, which is sponsored by the
former Kaypro User Group of the Boston Computer Society (now broadened to
include all CP/M and MS-DOS computers).  In case you are a BBSer, its phone
number is 617-965-7046.  This reaches first a v.32bis modem and, if that one
is busy, a USR Courier HST on line 2 (alternatively reachable directly at
617-965-7785).

   My user group at the Boston Computer Society has collected a number of
Kaypro computers, some in excellent working condition and some no longer
working.  The latter will be offered for parts.  If you are looking for
items such as keyboards, motherboards, cathode ray tubes, K10 hard disks,
mechanical hardware, and so on, make me an offer.  I would really like to
see the things put to good use rather than given to the trash collectors.  I
also have several sets of manuals and various software items.  There is too
much stuff for me to catalog; if you think I might have an item you could
use, ask and/or make an offer, and I will see if I have it.

Jay, this is not totally correct.  I ran a USRobotics HST/V32/V42bis on my 
Kaypro 10 for several years, at 19200 baud, without problem.  I DID have to
rewrite the overlay for BYE and Ybbat to do this though, as they were incorrectly handling the Z80-SIO fifo.  The SIO has a 4 character incomming FIFO, and it
will allow you to do 19,200 (or maybe even 38400) without a hitch if you 
implement a queue, and every time you go to get a character off the SIO, insteadget the chars off the SIO, and put them in the queue, and then return the top
char off the queue.  I am going to include ybh-kay1.asm which implements this 
at the end of this message.

Please note, most modem overlays such as bye, mex and others did not implement
this.  Hope you can use it and hope it helps.  BTW, the queue I used is 256
chars, if you need a bigger one (long interrupts blocking the sio for example
during a disk read) then you will need to enlarge it.

I found my Nevada Fortran manual and will send you a photocopy or
perhaps a scanned text file if I get your snail address.  I have the
software on 8" disks, but my S100 system is down.  I also have four
Kaypro's (10, 1, 2X, 4+88) and would like you to send me a copy of
the programs on 5 1/4" disks.  Which model Kaypro did you get?

By the time we connect it will probably be next year before you get
the manual, but you will get it.  I'm on vacation between Xmas and
New Year's.

I recently unearthed a carton of Verbatim 5.25 inch disks.  These
appear brand new (my guess is only 3 or 4 have seen the inside of a
disk drive).  If anyone out there has a use for Double Sided / Double
Density / 10 sector disks, I would be more than happy to trade you for
them.  (That's right, these are hard-sectored disks.)
    If you are interested in these (all 260 of them!), drop me a line.

Subject: Kaypro blowing fuses - hardware advice needed
Message-ID: <1h784bINNli3@diamond.pgh.wec.com>

My trusty pre-'83 Kaypro II (which, by the way, was under 18 feet of
acidic, muddy flood water for a couple of days in '85) blew a fuse
mid-session the other day.  Of course, a replacement fuse blew
immediately upon power-up.  Being more oriented toward the software end
of the computing world (but having some basic understanding of how the
hardware works), I appeal to the Kaypro hardware gurus for advice on where
to begin my diagnosis, probable causes, etc.  

One point bears mentioning:  the machine currently has two half-height
drives squeezed into the top half of the drive cage, leaving the bottom
half open at the front.  I _think_ I saw sparks through this opening
when the first fuse blew, but I can't be certain.  There were no visible
sparks on power-up with the replacement fuse.

Examination of the motherboard and power supply show a little rust on
the solder but no obvious "burned" spots.  There appear to be no "rust
bridges" in the layout.  The only thing that I've noticed that seems
questionable is a small, blackened spot at the top of C1 on the power
supply. 

I'd appreciate any suggestions that you can provide.

A note to Jay Sage: keep those spare parts handy!

Thanks ...

I am the owner of a Amstrad CPC 6128 with 1Mb Ramdisk.
On this system I am running CP/M 3.0 and CP/M 2.2 since
several years. But now i'm going to study some computer
science at the university of Erlangen-Nuerenberg/Germany.

Therefor I need the programming language scheme, for doing

It's time for me to make space for a new generation of computers, 
so I have to part with my old reliable, easy to understand, 8-bit computer.
I'm asking $300 for all of it, including the CP/M texts and the BYTE,
MicroSystems Journal, and S-100 magazines.
I'd like to sell it all as a unit, but will consider parting it out after a few
weeks if no reasonable offers are received.
It is currently plugged in and running with no known problems.

Subject: More on the Ztime-I Calendar/Clock
Message-ID: <1992Dec14.033217.13185@nemesis.orchard-park.ny.us>

I guess I woke some of you old die-hard Z80 folk up with my posting
on my left-over Ztime-I calendar/clocks.  If I don't reply individually,
it's because I was swamped with requests on information.  (for you folks
that sounded desparate, you should have gotten a call or Email)

Anyway, here's the scoop:

I have 15 bare circuit boards left for the Ztime-I.  The features
of the Ztime-I are:

- Under Z80 CPU installation
- Adds 32 I/O ports that provide the date/time in BCD
- Maintains time from "coin" battery.
- Simple to build from good/detailed instructions.
- Complete driver software to set/get time from chip in C, Pascal, and Basic.
- All parts can be ordered from DigiKey.

If you send me a check for $15 a board, I'll send you a bare circuit card,
a copy of the manual, and a 5 1/4" disk with the driver software.  If all
you need is a bare board, then the price is $10/board.  This includes shipping
to North America.

I hope this answers all your questions.  I also beg for forgiveness from
any of you that hate commercial "Exploitation" of Usenet.

Much more recently (Jan/Feb 1991) TCJ (The Computer Journal) published 
an article on how to build a very simple SCSI port.  It was just a 8255, 
and some decoding logic.  The handshaking was mostly done in software, 
except for the ACK signal which was generated by a flip-flop.  I've had 
a quick hack board made from this circuit running on my Z80 machine for 
the past 15 months without any problems.  Transfer speed is limited to 
whatever you can persuade your machine to do in software - about 45K/s 
for my 4 Mhz 1WS Amstrad.  I've been talking about adding DMA support to 
it for a while.  I might have a go at it over the Christmas break.

This was done even more recently in TCJ (Jun/Jul 1992 I think).  It 
mostly just turned a single 8 bit port into a 16 bit port by 
multiplexing.  It apparently works quite well.  It was connected to a 
board based on a 16Mhz Z280, and I think it used the built in DMA, so 
transfer speed would have been good.  There was some software (basic) 
with it too.

Does anyone know how to get cp/m kermit to pass an <ESC> sequence to the
computer it is connected to via the serial port.  I need to send the clear char
acter to my school's cms system in order to get anywhere on it.  If anyone has
used kermit to connect to a cms before, please let me know how you dealt with t
he PF keys and clear keyboard mapping problems.

I mentioned to a CP/M owner that people had been letting go of a lot of CP/M
material recently on the net.  This person responded that he would actually
make USE of some things:

	North Star Horizon components
	   he had a cpu board fail and went through hoops to find another one
	North Net boards&software in particular
	North Star Horizon specific software
	Pickles&Trout CP/M for Tandy Model II

As long I am taking up net space, I have an old S100 box sitting on the shelf
that still works.  I might be interested in novel S100 cards, with software,
to give a reason to turn it on and make it run again.  What ever happened to
those associative memory (cam) boards that were introduced for the S100?
How about stepper motor controller boards?  Something other than cpu/8k ram/
floppy boards.

Has anyone used a terminal program called Fastterm? I downloaded
it and tried it on my Kaypro 4. It starts all right and displays
a message that says "Hit any key to continue."
 
The problem is that when I hit a key, the computer locks up. If
anyone has any suggestions or has any experience with this
program, I would like to hear about it.
 
Thanks for your help.

Subject: Re: INFO-CPM Digest V92 #149, comm. with mapped keyboard

QTERM has it, and shows how to implement it.
You will also need the P.D. assembler and patcher pointed at in the QTERM
documentation.  QTERM and these are on SIMTEL20.
Very easy to implement even for a person like me with limited assembly
practice.
QTERM traps each keystroke, branches to some space where you can play, and
has a mechanism to let the rest of the program know if the stroke has to be
passed out to the comm. port right away, or be deferred, or be followed by
more stuff.
Actually that's how a QTERM user would simulate a VT100 keyboard for example.
If you know a little bit of Z80 assembly you will remap your keyboard in less
than 2 hours with a slow diskette system (testing faster with a HD of course).
David Goodenough (no error here I hope) thought about you when writing QTERM.

Have I missed something ?!?  I've been looking for another Kaypro II or two 
(if you'll pardon the pun) at a decent price (say, $100, $150) for awhile 
now.  

Is there some group I should be watching in addition to this one and the 
misc.forsale.* groups?

I've just bought NZCOM from Jay Sage's wife's (brother's cousin's dog's)
outfit, and at $50 it's a steal.  I brought up ZCPR3.3 some years ago the
hard way, compiling each unit and then linking the system, (at least I
had an older Z-system to work in) and NZCOM is an enormous improvement,
and really just as compact.  If I were bringing up Z again, I'd simply
buy NZCOM straight away - it's not worth fiddling with older versions
unless the hardware is unusually intractable.

They also do a full set of current Z-sys utilities, which is a good idea
if you don't have easy net access.  In fact, with the dearth of CP/M 
archives around the place I'm not sure you *could* get hold of a full
set of utilities/help files without enormous phone charges.

There is a suprising amount of good work being done in CP/M, if you can
find it, and Sage's outfit is a good place to start looking.  The other
is probably The Computer Journal, (916) 645-1670. 

Good luck - Will

    	I plugged it in and tried it. It booted and loaded it's

    score the surface of the disk. Not really wanting to spend a lot
    of time with it, I quit before I did any more damage.
    
    	Bottom line, it works sort of, if you have one or three
    already and want some good spare parts, or want to fix it up as
    an additional machine, it is in basically ok shape, I just don't
    need to play with ANOTHER operating system. (I'm already more
    deeply involved with Unix, DOS, & Commodore64 than I should be!)

    	Apparently the CPU, memory (64k) and monitor are ok, but
    it seems to have a disk problem. I never got as far as checking
    the second drive.

    	I would trade it for an old dos compatable printer, a
