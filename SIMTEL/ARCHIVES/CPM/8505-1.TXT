NetLandians,

I recollect long ago there was an archive out there that had a toolbox of
"C" utilities - maybe from DARPA?  Thought it was on ISIB or maybe SIMTEL20,
but can't seem to find it via FTP (don't like wildcard directory scans!).

Anybody point me to that C toolkit, please?  One of my local users will be
bringing up Unix (or something) on an NCR Tower, and they're studying C now.

Thanks in advance,

Recently, I have been using the Whitesmiths C compiler (1980 version) on
a CP/M 2.2 system. I'm really unhappy with this compiler and would like
suggestions on a replacement. The only other CP/M C compiler I know of is
one called BDS (?), which I have not had occasion to use.

Here are some examples of things I hate about the Whitesmiths C and would,
therefore, like to avoid in a replacement:
	
1) The names of many (most) of the "standard" library functions are very
different than for my 4.2 bsd C compiler; many of these functions require
unusual arguments and return unusual values. Most blatant example: putfmt,
instead of printf.

2) All externals need to be initialized (yes, even pointers and arrays,
although array names can be initialized to the null pointer).

3) You can have multiple functions in a single source file but, apparently,
NOT in the file that contains main().

4) putfmt (printf) doesn't flush the buffer until a NEWLINE is issued.

5) The compiler runs in 3 passes (preprocessor plus two compiler passes)
which are invoked separately from a script; it is a VERY slow process and I
can't figure out how to make it stop if an error occurs in an early phase
(short of hitting the reset button).

6) Generally flakey implementation of I/O functions, particularly those
that perform character I/O (text).

I could go on but I think you get the idea. Any suggestions for a replacement
will be appreciated. Also, please include $ amounts if you know them.

Dave - I think you may be thinking about the micro:<unix> directory at
SIMTEL20.  The Directory listing is in mocro:<unix>unix.crclst.  I don't
know of a specific C toolkit.

BTW, the NCR Tower runs System V.  (I use to play with it when it was
running V7.)

I have been trying to get my Kaypro to work on our LAN at 9600 baud through
a ROLM data phone (Kaypro goes to back of phone with a normal RS-232 cable).
The Kaypro is a IIx with two serial and one parallel ports.  The symptoms are
problem is
that about 1/3 of the characters are lost on data from the LAN.  The Kaypro
works fine on 1200 baud with a Ventel modem and dialup.

Is this a known problem with the Kaypro's?  Or do all roads lead to ROLM?
Thanks in advance for any help.  Tom.

Be aware that later models of the Kaypro seem to have changed the way
their video controller works - the original Ferguson model was all TTL
and faster than all get-out --- but the later Kaypros can't scroll or
position the cursor at any sort of reasonable rate.

We have two Kaypro termcaps here at UCSD - the fast and the slow one.
The slow one has 100mS delays on cursor positioning, line addition,
deletion, and other miscellaneous things.

So if you're having troubles with the Kaypro, try slowing things down.

For pointers to C compilers, get a copy of Dr. Dobb's. There were also a
number of reviews in Byte a while back. (August of some year - 1982 or 1983?).
Some of the ones you should check out: BDS, Q/C, C80, Aztec.

Whitesmith's C is indeed reputed to be a dog for the reasons which you list.
BDS C, on the other hand, is a pretty good product.  It is speedy and produces
relatively small object files.  But it is not a full implementation of C.
One of the things that is missing is floating point math, although there are
subroutines for doing floating point indirectly.  If you want a full implemen-
tation, I suggest you look at Computer Innovations CI-86.  It has a good
reputation and I think it supports an 8087 math coprocessor.   The ad in
May BYTE says that there is a new version available aimed at the IBM PC/AT
(Is this an irresistible trend??).  But there used to be a CPM-86 version
available.

>>> FLAME ON <<<

The question specifically stated a CP/M 2.2 system (you even put that
part in your reply) -- CI-86 (as the name suggests... ;-) is for
CP/M-86 -- 8087 support is not going to help any on a 2.2 system.

>>> FLAME OFF <<<

Anyway, the CP/M-86'ers out there probably appreciate the tip...

Waste not, want not, so here's a question of my own : Does anyone
know if there is a version of xlisp (or any other public
domain lisp package) around? Is it on simtel20? I'm running
CP/M+ (that's 3.0 -- the one with the good-features but no software...)
on an Osborne Executive. Thanks.

Rick:

I have both the BDS and Manx (Aztec II) C compilers for my CP/M system.
For Unix compatibility, I recommend the Manx compiler.  I have written
a fair number of programs which compile and execute without change
under both CP/M and 4.2bsd on VAXen and SUN-2 workstations.  I have
also ported, with minimal effort, several programs originally written
under 4.2bsd.

While the BDS compiler often seems to produce tighter code, I almost
always use the Aztec II compiler because it is much closer to the K&R
standard.  Manx has also recently added a number of the Berkeley
extensions such as "void" declarations.

If someone is interested, I could post a review of the Aztec II compiler.

In-Reply-To: Your message of 1 May 1985 16:05:56 EDT (Wednesday).


The Kaypro 4-84 boards (new kaypro 2's, kaypro 4's and kaypro 10's) --those
with reverse video, etc. -- use screen memory that is accessible only
through the video controller.  The Kaypro factory roms are rather slow and
fall behind when scrolling (e.g. when the cursor gets to the bottom of the
screen and a linefeed is sent). 1200 baud is about the limit for
continuous-stream text.

Plu*Perfect Systems is writing a new rom for Kaypros that includes a
snappier video driver.  I've  used a test version effectively at 4800 baud,
and with almost no glitches at 9600. That seems to be the limit of what can
be done in firmware, given the hardware memory interfacing.

When ready, it will be available from them and Advent Products.

That would be

Before said random flames cause confusion, C-86 is indeed NOT a CP/M 2.2
compiler, but works instead under CP/M-86 <<and>> MS-DOS/PC-DOS, with the
later version having switches for 80286 optimization.  It really won't
meet the needs of a 2.2 user.

BDS-C is an excellent system, but is unfortunately not one of the 'standard'
compilers (meaning that code from Un*x version whatever won't cross without
substantial effort).  But the price is hard to beat.  Walt Bilofsky has a 
CP/M-based C compiler and will shortly release the MS-DOS version.  His 
Software Toolworks, Inc. has a reputation for good software at very good 
prices.

There is a newer version of XLISP than the one in Volume 118 of the
SIGM collection.  It's available from SIMTEL20 as:

Filename			Type	 Bytes	 CRC

Directory MICRO:<CPM.XLISP>
PT.LQP.1			BINARY	  2688  157FH
XLBFUN.CQ.1			BINARY	  5376  7603H

XLSYM.CQ.1			BINARY	  3584  27F6H
XLSYS.CQ.1			BINARY	  2304  FC85H

Get XLISP12.LBR instead of the individual files if you want the whole
package at once.

XLISP14 does exist on the net, but it for 16-bit machines only (it's
too big to work on 8-bit machines, I've been told).

#include "stdlib.c" has to be the last line and must be followed by a
carriage return.  I'm pretty sure that works: we had the same problem

The sq-usq (CP/M compatible file compression utility) you posted to
net.sources does not work correctly on 4.2 BSD Unix.  USQ causes a
core dump.  SQ makes squeezed files which do not unsqueeze correctly
(they are truncated).

A portable SQ/USQ was recently posted to net.sources.  It does work
correctly on 4.2 BSD Unix.  It is available from SIMTEL20 (to ArpaNet
users) in two forms:

Filename		Type	 Bytes	 CRC

Directory MICRO:<UNIX.CPM>
SQU-PORT.SHAR.1		ASCII	 40065  7B21H <--for Unix users

Directory MICRO:<CPM.SQUSQ>
SQU-PORT.LBR.1		BINARY	 29952  D82CH <--same files but in
					      .LBR form

SQU-PORT.LBR is also available from my RCPM (RCPM Royal Oak, MI -
313-759-6569) for those who do not have access to SIMTEL20.

Jim Zajac, a user of RCPM Royal Oak is getting conflicting answers from
the Anchor modem people.  He would like to contact Ed Rickter for more
details.  I hope we can find someone to help.  It annoys me to see a
manufacturer apparently giving out different information to different
people.  If there is a problem they should admit it.  We would all
have greater respect for them and be more inclined to buy their product
because we knew they gave good user support.

Tom,
I didn't get a good return address so I'll reply to the net.

I have had the same problem with both a Kaypro 2 and a Kaypro 4 when they
are connected to a Sytek LAN here at NOSC.  It skips part of a line at
any speed greater than 1200 baud.  I have used Kaypro's TERM program,
MODEM7, KERMIT, and the NOSC TRANSFER terminal programs on the Kaypros
with the same result.
1200 baud works fine for both the Sytek LAN and the Hayes Smartmodem 1200.

Good Luck,

Jim Harmon

The following files needed to be modified to work with DECUS C compiler
on VAX/VMS.

sqio.c
tr1.c
tr2.c
usq.c
utr.c

The modification was minor, each statement of form:

	return x;

is required to have a parenthesized expression:

	return (x);

this change will not affect adversely any compiler I know of
(and it is better style anyway...) so I suggest that it be
added into the source (SIMTEL20 - micro:<unix.cpm>sq-port.shar)
when it is convenient

Whoops!!  The original poster was looking for a compiler for a CP/M 2.2
system.  The C-86 compiler is for MS-DOS systems.  Perhaps there's a C-86
for CP/M-86, but this still won't run on a humble z-80.  

There are a number of reasons not to go with the BDS compiler, the primary
one being slight non-standardness.  I have the Manx Aztec C.  It's quite
standard and is rather nice to work with.  The problem with it is that it
generates lousy code (n.b. mine is rather old.  I understand newer releases
are somewhat tighter).  No discussions of CP/M C compilers would be complete
without mention of Software Toolworks' C/80.  Very inexpensive, very solid
compiler, but *very* incomplete.  I bought one two years ago.  At that time
the rather tiny library was in assembler.  I think that right now the most
appealing of the compilers is EcoSoft C.  I don't have one, but I understand
that they generate good, fast code and are reasonably K & R standard.  I
think it also supports post-K & R constructs.

Hope this helps ...

I am posting this to net.micro.cpm instead of net.sources because I believe it
to be of no interest to anybody other than a CP/M user.

Here are sources for ldir.c and ltype.c, two probably very familiar library
utilities. I acquired these from a local BBS, where they had been posted as
IBM PC utilities. It took a little effort to adapt them to our 4.2bsd 
environment.

Now all that is needed is for somebody to build on these routines (and on the
'usq' I posted a few days ago to net.sources) to create a full 'lu' utility,
which would be *VERY* handy in facilitating file transfers to/from home.

I am sure some of you will improve and enhance these utilities. Please post
your upgrades so we all can share them.

XProgram Description:
X	This program is intended for use on RCPM systems to
X	allow callers to see the contents of the directories
X	of .LBR files on the system.  You probably won't need
X	it on your home system, since the -L function of LU.COM
X	provides this ability.  Since LU is not active on
X	remote systems, a program like this is necessary
X	to allow you to see member names in a library without
X	your having to download the library first.
X
X	It has been modified to run under Unix 4.2bsd, as a help
X	to those of us who transfer files between our home systems
X	and VAXen.

(Gad, this is hard to do..)

A warning to all users who acquired a copy of sq-usq that I posted to the net a
few days ago:  THIS SOFTWARE MAY NOT WORK!!! I have received a serious bug 
report from a respected user, who informs me that not only will this software
not squeeze/unsqueeze stuff compatibly with his (latest version) utilities, but
that usq crashes with a core dump in the attempt!  I might normally question the
circumstances, but in this situation I'm afraid I have to retract without
question.

To those of you who sent me mail asking for a copy, I have to apologize for
this posting. I am trying to acquire a version that has been well-tested by
users on the net, so that it could be posted in place of my original, in the
hopes that nobody else gets stung.

It was not my intent to post a defective software package. In fact, I have been
using this package for several months (since December) on our VAX in conjunction
with a (different) package at home, with no trouble. I felt that, with this
amount of 'testing', it was working correctly, so there would be no problem in
posting it!

I recently purchased C/80 V3.1.  The library seems very complete, and
*C* sources are included.  The most significant limitations to V3.1
include:

	Float, double, entry and typedef keywords not implemented
	Float and long constants and arithmetic (Float and long may be
		added with the optional [$29.95??] "mathpak")
	Typedef not implemented
	Bit fields not implemented
	#line directive not implemented

    **  Function calls must have the same number of arguments as the
		called function definition.  (There is a hack to make
		[s]printf work correctly.)
	#define does not allow arguments
	Blocks: declarations are allowed only at the beginning of a
		function

For $49.95, I've found C/80 V3.1 to be a very useful tool.  My biggest
complaint is inherent in the nature of it's recursive descent
algorithm; once an error is discovered, the compiler "discovers" MANY
more errors until it gets itself resynched with the input.

Intertec makes/made a networked version of the Superbrain called the

		CP/EM Makes CP/M 80 Available to the IBM-PC

	The ICU Group announces CP/EM - CP/M 80 Emulation that gives
	IBM PC/XT/AT and compatible computers the ability to run
	thousands of CP/M 80 programs without the expense of additional
	coprocessor board.

	CP/EM efficiently emulates the CP/M 80 environment on an MS-DOS
	based personal computer.  CP/EM allows MS-DOS redirection of
	input and output devices to be used to alter device assignments
	allowing CP/EM access to all standard MS-DOS devices and any
	installed device drivers.  CP/EM uses the standard MS-DOS file
	system allowing data files to be shared between CP/M and MS-DOS
	applications.  The Command Interpreter provides all of the
	standard commands provided by the CP/M 80 console command
	processor.

	Serial communications programs are included with CP/EM to aid
	in the transfer of programs and data between CP/M and the
	MS-DOS computer.

	CP/EM is written in assembly language by the same people that
	implemented the BIOS for the Wang Professional Computer.  Their
	expertise in writing fast efficient programs has been proven in
	many Wang products and now in CP/EM.

	CP/EM runs on any MS-DOS, version 2.0 or later, based personal
	computer with at least 32K of memory available for application
	programs.

	CP/EM is available now for $79.95.

Subject: BBS/RCPM recommendations

    I have got rather weary of expanding RBBS37 beyond its
    capabilities and still not having a really good BBS/RCPM. Do you
    have any suggestions for a really nifty system for a Kaypro 10?
    Willing to pay a reasonable price for a good one, fairly easy to
    install. I looked at the ZBBS100.Lbr and not bad but appears to
    be tough to conver from H89 to Kaypro. Thought about maybe MBBS.
    Have looked into Z-Node but appears that is somewhere into the
    future. Looking at RBBS4102 but I have no "C" tools or skills.
    Any sugggstion gratefully accepted.

CBBS is still the best, in my opinion.  Many new features have been
added, including automatic notification of messages waiting for the
caller.  This is a beautiful study in machine language coding, worth
the $50 price.  Ward & Randy have an excellent update policy too.

See MICRO:<CPM.GENDOC>CBBSFORM.DAT for details on how to get CBBS.
This file is also available on many RCPMs, including my RCPM Royal Oak
(313) 759-6569.

Subject: Relocatable fFiles with MAC
From: Steve Noland <NOLAND@USC-ISI.ARPA>
To: INFO-CPM@AMSAA.ARPA

I have heard that DR's MAC assembler can produce a file that contains
a bit map that can be used by MOVCPM (etc.) to relocate same.  The
terminology is "Page Relocatable Format" with a default file type of
.PRL.  I am unable to locate reference to this in the MAC documentation.
This feature would be really handy for doing BIOS modifications.  Can somebody
shed some light on this?

Thanks in advance,

Does anyone have a UNIX program which can pack and unpack cp/m ".lbr"
files?  If so, I'd really appreciate having it.

Alternatives would be either a C program for cp/m which I could convert,
or a detailed description of the ".lbr" format so I could write my own.
Thanks for any help.

                        May 6, 1985

     I received many replies to my request for a better CP/M
C  compiler  than  Whitesmiths.  Everyone  agrees  that Whi-
tesmiths C Compiler is a dog.  How can they  get  away  with
selling such trash at such a high price (about $700.00) - is
the market asleep?.  Anyway, here is a  summary  of  what  I
learned:

1)   The nearly unanimous favorite was the  Aztec  'C'  com-
piler from Manx Software. This compiler costs about $200.00.
The Aztec C compiler was liked because of its similarity  to
the 4.2 bsd Unix C compiler, because it includes source code
for the library, and because of it has pretty good  compila-
tion  speed.   However, a common complaint was that the code
generated is not very efficient, making for rather long pro-
gram  files. Since I am writing large programs this may be a
problem for me.

2)   There are a number of inexpensive  C  compilers  (under
$100.00),  all of which appear to produce efficient code and
sport fast compilation times.  These compilers suffered from
varying  degrees  of "non-standardness".  The BDS C compiler
was the most well liked in this class.

3)   Several people mentioned the  Eco-Soft  C  compiler  as
being the most modern, standard, and complete CP/M implemen-
tation. However, none of these people had actually used  the
compiler;  all  were  reporting second hand information.  If
anyone has any hands-on experience with  this  compiler  I'd
like to hear from you.

I have these changes made already. I will be posting sq-uport as soon as I
get verification (from the site that reported problems with the sq-usq utilities
I posted last week) that sq-uport still works at sites other than this one.

A recent file was distributed outlining the CHECKSUM and CRC protocol used
in the modem7 (CHRISTENSEN) program series.  It was named MODMPROT.003.
This was great,  as I was working on a modem program to be compatable with
these protocols.  However,  it was missing the BATCH protocol.

Is there any documentation on the BATCH protocol commonly used in modem7?
The file names are transferred as well as the data for each file. 
This is the most useful protocol for mass transfers between machines.

This was written in Turbo by one of our 820 tech.reps.  He uses it to
test the keyboards to verify that all are working.  It is fairly self
explanitory.  It uses the 820-II's graphics so KBDTEST will not work
with the 820-I.  Turn the LOCK off first. Then touching any key will
'white' the square out.  A SHIFTED-any key will turn the key 'color'

The Kaypro is too slow to run at 9600 baud for terminal emulation.

I had a Kaypro 2 and now have a Kaypro 10. Neither machine can put
characters on the screen much faster than 1800 baud when using
Kermit (or other terminal emulation programs). 

It may be possible to buffer the arriving characters and
compensate for the slowness of the rom-based screen handling routines
if interrupt routines are used to avoid losing characters during
"expensive" operations (scrolling, clear display, etc.).

For file transfers I regularly use 9600/19200 baud when directly
connected to Unixes or other micros.

Subject: Kaypro II at high baud rates
To: info-cpm@AMSAA.ARPA

I have been using my Kaypro II ("old" style) at 19200 baud regularly for about
two years now.  In addition, I never need to use the flow control characters
^S and ^Q, so EMACS works without key rebindings.

It's true that you need to write your own terminal emulator which is interrupt
driven.  Incoming characters cause an SIO interrupt so even if an "expensive"
operation is happening, like clearing the screen, the character is grabbed and
stuffed into a circular buffer.  The queued-up characters are processed when
the "expensive" operation completes.  I also bypass the ROM screen handling
routines and write to video ram directly. (Apparently on the "new" 2 and 10
the video controller chip limits the thruput to something around 9600 baud or
less, even when you write software to drive it and bypass the ROM.)

The Kaypro II hardware can operate at high baud rates; too bad standard
software doesn't bother to do it.

Someone was complaining that the kaypro doesn't work well emulating
a terminal at high baud rates.  Someone else replied that it was possible
but you had to write your own emulation program to get it to work.

Microcornucopia magazine (P.O. Box 223, Bend, Ore. 97709 503-382-8048)
has a public domain version on one of their user disks (disk k23).
This is interrupt driven.  A friend of mine has used it so he could
use his kaypro as terminal to a surplus S-100 machine he picked up
cheap.

From: Ralph E Droms <droms@PURDUE.ARPA>

I'd like to use M7FNK to remap the MODEM7 function keys.  I downloaded
M7FNK successfully (length and crc look OK).  When I executed the
program, my system just hung.  I disassembled the first few lines of
the program with DDT, and found a "CALL 0DCD".  Since the length of the
program is only 3072 (0xC00) bytes, this call is directed toward a
location past the end of the program!?!

Has anyone successfully used M7FNK?  Is the source available somewhere?

A new doc file detailing the YAM modem program protocols is now
available from SIMTEL20:

Filename			Type	 Bytes	 CRC

Directory MICRO:<CPM.YAM>
YMODEM.DQC.1			BINARY	 24704  4837H

YAM uses the MODEM2/MODEM7 protocol for CRC and CHECKSUM and has it's
own BATCH protocol.  It also allows optionally setting the packet
length to 1k instead of the usual 128-bytes, which should improve the
throughput when using the new 2400-baud modems.

Even if you have no interest in YAM, the portion detailing the MODEM
procotol is useful.

Subject: YAM modem program documentation available

I thought you might like to know the reason for the appearance of
YMODEM.DOC at this point. Due to the new proliferation of 2400 baud
modems, a lot of people are acutely aware of the shortcomings of
Christensen protocol's use of 128 byte blocks. There has been a
protracted discussion of this on Compuserve's CP/M interest group, and
at present we expect that Ward Christensen will be authoring an
article destined for Byte which will summarize his protocol as well as
suggest an expansion. There is a good possibility that the extensions
will be the YMODEM protocol as implemented in YAM, with or without
some as yet unspecified additions. In fact, the father of YAM, Chuck
Forsberg, may be a co-author.

In the meantime, Irv Hoff is planning on making some modifications to
MDM740 to support 1K blocks. Several of us have lobbied hard for him
to follow the YAM format and I think that he has agreed at least in
princpal. One of the strengths of Christensen protocol is its
simplicity, and YAM expands upon it, adding functionality while not
making the implementation unreasonably complex. In any case, my
feeling is that Ward's article will define the protocol extensions and
if Irv or anone else were to go off on another path, it would only
muddy the waters and damage the universal strength of Christensen protocol.

I'm looking for a version of MODEM7 which is compatable for the Tekelec
Chameleon Protocol Tester which is running CP/M Version 2.2 from Digital
Research. The Tekelec runs on an Intel 8085.
We would like to use UMODEM to perform uploading and downloading but we
don't have the terminal emulation program that is compatable.

The terminal emulation program that we did receive is SOFTCOM. The
alternitive is to find a program comparible to UMODEM,
which runs on a VAX 11/780 running UN*X SVR2, that we can use with SOFTCOM
terminal emulation program.

Thanks,
Kevin Kulhanek

	As there has been some mention of this compiler recently I thought
I'd just mention this. There is a UNIX V7 compatible library available for the
Software Toolworks C compiler (v3.1 only). It contains about 130 functions
and is written in assembler (requires a Z80 and CP/M v2.2). The Mathpack
is not needed. It costs 50 pounds sterling and is available from:

Grey Matter Ltd.,

My only connection with the product is that I wrote it.

Charlie Strom mentions an overhaul of MODEM/YAM apparantly in the
offing.  First, let me compliment all the folks that made MODEM7 et al
operate as well as it does -- Ward Christiansen and conspiracy
have done well.
	Now some suggestions when the new model is worked up:
-*-*- Larger blocks will improve throughput on quiet lines, and that
capability is a worthwhile pursuit.  But some of us live with noisy lines,
at least some of the time.  The option of reverting back to smaller
blocks should be preserved for that and compatability reasons.
-*-*-  Has anyone considered adding error correcting coding?  There exists
a CCITT standard.  Since processing power is cheaper than communications
power, this might be worthwhile.
-*-*-  A little systems integration might be in order here.  To
do business, I need MODEM7 to work with my micro friends and Kermit
to talk to the net.  Could we all get together?
-*-*-  Suggest writing the code in as high a level language a practical
to facilitate porting.

Correct me if I am wrong, but weren't the posted sources for the IBM-PC?
Ltype didn't compile (at least on Xenix) until I also included types.h
and neither it nor usq seemed to work, but that may be inconsistencies in
Xenix's C compiler. I think they could be made into {U,Xe,Ve}nix sources
fairly easily but aren't quite yet.

*** NAK THIS LINE ***

A description of several enhancements to the popular Ward Christensen
"XMODEM" protocol has been distributed to bulletin board systems with
the file name YMODEM.DOC.  An article late this year in Byte Magazine
will cover the same topics.

YMODEM provides enhanced operation with high speed modems, especially
over satellite links.  The batch transfer option allows programs such
as "Professional-YAM" to send files between DOS, Unix, and other systems
while preserving exact file length and modification date.

The file is available on Telegodzilla (503-621-3746 1200,300 bps) in
normal and squeezed (YMODEM.DQC) form.  A sister file YMODEME.D[OQ]C
is formatted for a Gemini or Epson printer with boldface, etc.

UUCP sites can obtain these files with
	uucp omen!/usr/spool/uucppublic/ymodem.doc /tmp

ymodeme.doc and ymodem.shar (mm macro) are in the same directory.

The following L.sys line calls Telegodzilla (Pro-YAM in host operation),
accesses the locally connected Xenix machine with YAM's "link" command,
and then logs in as uucp.

The Kaypro does scrolling by moving all the characters in the video
RAM up one line (using a Z80 block move instruction).  This takes a
long time.  The solution is to use a program that can accept input
from the host while the scrolling is being done.  This is not
trivial because it requires an interrupt handler that bypasses the
BIOS.  It might be necessary to have XON/XOFF handshaking too.  I wrote
such a program and use it regularly on my Kaypro II (talking at
9600 Baud to my UNIX machine).  Micro Cornucopia also has one on
a public-domain disk (and much other stuff of interest to Kaypro
hacks).

I agree that we should keep short as well as long blocks in the code.  It
makes more sense for some people.  
The idea of Kermit and modem7 getting together sounds VERY exciting.  They
are both very popular in their areas (Modem7 is more micro-micro, less
micro-mini/mainframe, where Kermit was devloped to go between the larger
systems, as well as micros).  I think it would be a great step forward
if someone could merge the two protocols into one program.

While I see your points, there seems to be a consensus among those who
are planning to actually implement the changes to the protocol that if
things are made significantly more complex we will lose the
universality of Christensen protocol. Anyone is of course free to add
whatever bells and whistles he likes (Pro-YAM for example supports
Christensen, YAM [1K blocks], Kermit and Compuserve B protocols) but
the basic definition of the protocol should not be made needlessly
complex.
By the way, YAM's protocol allows an arbitrary mixture of 128 and 1024
byte blocks, and SOH signaling the former wile an STX the latter.

NetLandians,

A while ago I offered access to a pretty nice (and different) random
number generator using the Tausworthe Algorithm as implemented by
Prof. Arne Thesen et al.

I fixed it up a bit (mainly bells and whistles), and it's now a pretty
nice demo program (to include a distribution display).

If anyone found the original interesting/useful, feel free to grab this
version.  It's available via anonymous FTP from my host, USC-ISID, in
my directory, ABN.ISCAMS, under the file name:
TAUSGEN3.PAS

Any feedback would be appreciated.  If any good at all (my Pascal is still
pretty shabby), you might let the wizards/archivists at SIMTEL20 know.

Just a note about using wd-40.  I have a friend who is a maintenance
chief for the navy at Miramar naval air station.  He says that the
navy will not allow wd-40 to be used because of its corrosive actions.
I have personaly noted some things on my watch buttons that verify the
statement.  I personally use wd-40 to free up stuck things (and it
does do a good job) but then I make sure I clean and reoil the part
affected.

	Help!! We are trying to find a way to move files from an ERG
computer running CP/M 68K, to our UN*X system (4.2BSD). I figure the
easiest way is to get a modem program that runs under CP/M 68K, but I
haven't yet been able to find one. Can anyone tell me where I can get
such a program? It can be either commercial or public domain; our primary
concern is that we need it soon!
	We have the DRI and Whitesmith's 'C' compilers, so either an
object code version or C source would be of help.
	XMODEM-type protocol would be desirable, but is not absolutely
necessary. High baud rate would also be a plus, but anything that can
manage at least 1200 baud is acceptable. We don't even absolutely need
terminal-type operation, just the ability to transfer files. If anyone
out there has such a program, or knows where to get it, I will be eternally
grateful if you'd get in touch with me soonest.

The MODEM7 batch protocol has many problems besides being tied too closely
to CP/M filenamne conventions, to wit:

 Fm: Ward Christensen 76703,302
 To: Paul Ferrara    70075,252
 
 Modem7 batch was pretty poorly implemented ... complaint was that a
 character-by-character echo was used, which is not a generally recognized
 technique.  It should instead have been something like Forsberg uses with YAM -
 a block 0 with the filename.  I have had transfers drive me nuts, because the
 other end echoing the outgoing filename causes enough distortion that it tried,
 and tried, and tried, and tried..   but when it finally made it, the FILE
 itself made it with no hitch.  The weakness was the echoing.

I posted an article recently concerning the availibility of the YMODEM spec
that Ward is writing up for an article in Byte.  If there is sufficient
demand, I will post the file to net.sources or somewhere directly.

Is there a modification to CPM 2.2 that will insure that the ARCHIVE
bit (third character of ext.) is reset whenever the file is modified,
at present pip and WS don't reset this bit after edit, and this plays
havoc with my backup efforts on a large rigid.  CPM 3 appears to do
this, but was not implemented in 2.2, any pointers would be
appreciated.

I don't know about any F77 compilers, but I have seen ads in Byte for
NEVADA FORTRAN from ELLIS COMPUTING, which claims to be F66, for only
29.99 or 39.99 (?), so it certainly is affordable.

Hope this helps.

Expanding on the query about F77 compiler availability for a Morrow,

Does anyone have a good Fortran (F77) compiler they would recommend
for CP/M systems in general?  (Not for any one machine....)

Just a note to those who are thinking out (i hope) changes in the Modem/
Xmodem/Kermit comm. tools. There is a very good example of an inhanced
version of these called "LCTERM". This Program combines modem protocols
and Kermit as selections in one of its pull down menues. This program
currently runs only on DEC RAINBOWS under MS_DOS,but would be worth
a look for anyone rebuilding anny of these programs.

Fellow CP/Mers - I have noticed an increasing volume of mail erroneously

     Articles to be posted to the distribution list should be sent to

The ONLY types of mail that should be sent to "info-cpm-request@amsaa.arpa"
are requests for addition/deletion to/from the list, complaints concerning
delivery of info-cpm, and requests for assistance that do not seem approp-

	We have people here that installed the PROWRITER for WordStar using
the option for the NEC 8510 dot matrix printer. They say that the codes are 
the same for both printers. You can give it a . 

	Another note, but from the MSDOS world. When you dinstall WS2000
under DOS 2.0 it only removes from your hard disk the main WordStar file.
It then breaks the links to all of the subdirectories where it puts the 
other files. Using TREE will not find the files or directories. This means
that about 800Kb of disk is now lost. The only way we found to recover the 
disk space is to back up the disk, reformat and then reload. Glad we found 
this out on someone else's machine not mine, guess I won't be getting WS2000.

I've found a small bug in my Turbo Pascal REFS program that slipped
through all my initial testing.  If it reads a file that happens to be
a multiple of 128 bytes in length and not end with a ^Z, it tries to
read past EOF.  A <= sign is in the distributed version where there
should be a <.

The new version is now available from SIMTEL20 as:

Filename			Type	 Bytes	 CRC

Directory MICRO:<CPM.TURBOPAS>
REFS13.LBR.1			BINARY	 12288  E598H

A short review of what REFS is:

REFS finds references in scientific manuscripts.  It will list references
found and the number of times they are occur to a file, a printer, or
the system console.  It  should work with references of the forms:

       Smith, 1980                   |Smith (1980)
       Smith, 1980a                  |Smith (1980a)
       Smith, 1980a, b               |Smith (1980a, b)
       Smith, 1980a, 1980b           |Smith (1980a, 1980b)
       Smith and Smith, 1980         |Smith and Smith (1980)
       Smith et al., 1980            |Smith et al. (1980)
       Smith's 1980                  |Smith's (1980)
       Smith, Smith, and Smith, 1980 |Smith, Smith, and Smith (1980)
       Smith-Smythe and Smith 1980

and with most any similar style.  It also allows the last digit of the
year to be replaced by a letter, as Smith, 198x, for cases where the
exact date is uncertain.  It may not work entirely properly on
references in tabular formats, specifically if a reference of the form
Smith 1980a,b is split between lines so that the 'b' is widely
separated from the 'a'.

Month, year dates, as July, 1980, also are treated as references.  You
never know when some person might have the same name as a month.

Please let me know of any bugs found, bug fixes made, or improvements
made.

Re:   MAKSRL Uploaded

For anyone that's interested, I'm uploading MAKSRL.LBR, which allows
you to create what I call SRL (self-relocating) COM files.

There's been a scad of ways used at one time or another to produce COM
files which, when executed, will determine where high memory is, then
relocate the bulk of the code into the highest possible memory
location for execution.  The most difficult example I've come across
is in BYE, which has a whole section devoted to examining its own code
to determine which bytes must be modified.

MAKSRL lets you do it fairly easily.  The MAKSRL.COM program takes two
object files which have been created by L80 with MAKSRL.SUB or
MAKSRL.DO from an M80 REL file and produces a COM file which does the
whole thing with practically no fuss at all.  The whole process comes
down to creating an M80 source file which expects to execute in high
memory, then SUBMIT MAKSRL <name>, or (in Tdos) DO MAKSRL <name>.

MAKSRL is loosely based on and heavily modified from the MAKELUX
program in LUX40.LBR which creates LUX.COM.

(the second address is what we are told is the new proper format for

no way proper, and I have had our mailer set up w/ an alias to accept
the older (top) version.  From what I understand, the '<' and '>' are

The Prowriter is configured as a "Non-backspacing printer" with "No
communications protocol" and output is to the "Primary list device".
The following are printer patches for WS version 3.33 .  Rather than
going through the long installation (WINSTALL), use DDT.  The save
length for this version is 75.

Does anyone know of a terminal emulator for the Kaypro II that emulates
a vt100 or vt52 as far as screen handling goes??  The keypad DOES NOT have
to generate the proper escape codes....but the screen has to respond to 
incoming cursor-addressing codes, in vt100 or vt52 format  (I believe the
standard Kaypro cursor-addressing is the same as an adm3a...).

micros?  I am talking about H8's, H89's, H/Z100's, H/Z150's,

   For some of you, this will be a repost. However, I got nary a nibble
with the limited domain I last chose, so I am now posting to a larger
audience. Please give me a hand if you know of this company, as I am
currently stuck. Thanks...

   I recently bought a pair of XCOMP cards--a hard disk controller
card, and a Z-80 S-100 host interface card. Without doc. I know, but
the price was RIGHT. My normal sources have availed me nought in
locating this company, so now I appeal to net-readers. Can someone
pass me the address, phone #, what-have-you for this company? Please
respond to this message via net.micro.cpm, as I am solemnly assured
that netmail otherwise doesn't make it in here.

Here on the DDN (Arpanet/milnet) where your message appeared on INFO-CPM,
we have several mailing lists currently in place that you can easily
link up with.   There is HEATH-PEOPLE@MIT-MC for H8, H19, H89, Z90, etc.
which lately has been having very little traffic (about 2 a month).

I personally am the moderator of INFO-HZ100@RADC-TOPS20 which has medimum
to heavy traffic daily covering the H/Z-110/120 and MS-DOS, etc.

INFO-IBMPC@USC-ISIB covers the IBM machines and its clones (Z-150, Z-200).

Cheers,
Gern

one of my ex-customers(they just un-plugged it!) has some DECSystem-10

had for the cost of shipping. the following is a list of the stuff that
is available:

	2ea	DF10C	22-bit data channel
	3ea	RH10	Massbuss Interface(use with above)
	4ea	MG10	128 k-36 bit core memory boxes
	10-12	rp04 Disk drives. these have NO PORT MODULES.

All of this equipment was on contract with DEC untill it was turned off
and was in good working order. 

if there is a site out there,or if you know of someone who would like
this equipment,please mail me your address and phone number, and i will
put you in touch with the proper people. hope this doesn't violate some

Thanks to Chuck , I got an explanation of the usenet mail paths.
As several folks sent me msgs. syaing that they were as confused as me,
I have included Chuck's msg.

The only remaining question is, if more than one path is listed, and you
don't know who sends mail to whom and when, which path should you chose?

I guess us Mil/Arpanet users are really spoiled.

Subject: Re: Usenet Mail Addresses
In-reply-to: your article <10790@brl-tgr.ARPA>

Jeff, the "{"'s usually symbolize an OR construction, especially if the 
sites are separated by vertical bars (|). So yes {hplabs|dual|qantel}
would mean any one of those sites. As for which path is best, I prefer
to use the least number of hops algorithim unless I know a site is
slow or overloaded in which case I can sacrifice a few hops to go around
it. And as some systems get mail in the morning and send it out at night
one "hop" can represent one day of travel time. So things are slow. On
the arpa side if you see somone with a path that includes ucbvax then
you can use that to mail to them. For instance my path descriptor is

{ihnp4,fortune}!dual\                     
        {qantel,idi}-> !intelca!cem      
 {ucbvax,hao}!hplabs/                   

which has ucbvax in the bottom line. To construct a path out of this
you notice that either ucbvax OR hao can go through hplabs to intelca
so the path becomes "hplabs!intelca!cem" which is everything except 
the ucbvax part, and the arpa address is then 
"hplabs!intelca!cem"@Berkeley because Berkeley is the same as ucbvax on
the usenet side. I have heard that brl-bmd will also gateway messages
in this way to the usenet side. Is this clear now?

In my opinion, your msg. did not violate any "un-spoken rule on
advertising on the net" because, as you said, it is free to a good home.

I am not sure that I would want to post a notice saying that I had some
personal hdw or software for sale, though.  (I guess that the usenet guys
can do it as usenet is a "commercial" net as compared to the gov't-sponsored
Arpa/Milnet.)

I've found that the best path from ARPA-land to USENET is to always
use host "seismo". If "seismo" is one of the choices given in a {} selection,
like {decvax,seismo,aplvax}!crash!bang!thud or the like, then use seismo,
and append "@seismo" on the end of the string. To send to the above fake
address, you'd send to "seismo!crash!bang!thud@seismo.ARPA" (your own mailer
will probably put that ".ARPA" on the end automatically).

If all you have is a string of exclamation-point addresses, like

zap!oof!bletch!crud

then again surround them with "seismo"s, like:

seismo!zap!oof!bletch!crud@seismo

in your "To:" field. This seems to work just about all the time...

Pragmatically, Will Martin

I don't know if you can dial in directly, but all you need is to
dial into any machine you have access to that can:

   FTP from the arpa host w/ XLisp (or whatever you want)

		and

   XMODEM or KERMIT to your own machine

(For that matter, it doesn't have to be one machine....my usual path
 is to log on to our network's gateway as a guest, FTP to that account,
 netcopy it to my own account on another machine (delete the copy on
 the guest account, so they don't get mad) and then XMODEM from the
 second computer to my machine at home......a bit long, but it gets
 the job done....)

		Hope this helps,

I don't have XLISP 1.4, sorry.  XLISP 1.2 is available from my RCPM
Royal Oak (MI) system, (313) 759-6569.  It's on the D: drive there as

Message-ID: <TYM-ACB-6Z2Y9@OFFICE-2>

Before I rush out and blow money on repairs, a quick question.  My 8 incher 
(morrow disk jockey 2) no longer unloads the head after an idle period.  This 
used to be intermittent then would work for 5 minutes  after power up and is 
now solid.  All is well as long as I don't open the door to change disks.  When
I close door with a new disk the head is still loaded but the controller is 
confused and no longer can read until the controller is reset AND the drive is 
powered off and on.

I did verify that the LOAD HEAD line is active from the controller but don't 
know if the controller is responsible for unloading the heads or is it the 
drive that signals not ready and then the controller unloads the heads.  Don't 
know if the controller or drive is at fault.  Any ideas.  Thanks in advance.

Well thanks for the help.  I found that the index LED was fading out and 
finally stopped all output.  The drive will not unload the heads if the disk is
not ready (weird).  Also the disk stays ready once the condition was detected 
untill the door is opened.  Apparently the LED was ok right after power but 
faded as it got hot.  I replaced it with a high output Infrared LED from radio 
shack and all is well.  Weird!

In-reply-to: Msg of 20 May 1985  14:32-MDT from MAX: ; at max.decnet, artman at max.decnet

    Does anyone know of a terminal emulator for the Kaypro II that
    emulates a vt100 or vt52 as far as screen handling goes??  The
    keypad DOES NOT have to generate the proper escape codes....but
    the screen has to respond to incoming cursor-addressing codes, in
    vt100 or vt52 format (I believe the standard Kaypro
    cursor-addressing is the same as an adm3a...).

Kermit-80 has a VT52 emulator.  There is a version for the Kaypro II.
It's available via anonymous FTP from CU20B.  Inquiries to
Info-Kermit-Request@CU20B.ARPA, please.

I have the NEVADA FORTRAN, and it is not 77 -- it's a variant of 66.
At the price it is OK if you desparately need Fortran, but it is not very
transportable, and it lacks much of the necessary f77 features.

Your problem is not as weird as it may seem at first. The WD179X series
of disk controllers unload heads after 15 revolutions if no other command
has been received. The way it counts revolutions is by counting the index
pulses, which it couldn't do in this case. Also the problem with the drive
staying ready even after the index holes could not be detected is a problem
with the control logic on the Shugart SA800/801. We were using a power-down
circuit to shut off power to the drive motors and after much work found
out why our software would never detect that the drive was not ready. Shugart
fixed this problem on their 850/860 series. I'm not sure that all floppy
manufacturers had the same problem or not.

I recently copied a version of the squeeze/unsqueeze programs from 
SIMTEL20 (I believe).  This version was written in C, and intended
to be compatible w/ those already in distribution.  I sent in one
change to make the source more portable (add parens to the returned
values in the return statements of subroutines).  I just found out,
by trying to usq a phone list I just ftp'd that other versions of 
squeeze apparently DO NOT include the original file name w/in the
squeezed file....thus making this edtition definitely NOT compatible
with the versions available from many RCPM systems.  The algorithm
for compression may match, but the file format is incompatible!  The
main point is: I have lost the arpa address of the person that seems
to be "managing" this particular source.  If this program sounds
familiar to anyone, please send me a msg, w/ the address of the person
I need to talk to......

As far as I know, there are two other Fortran compilers, but they
are more expensive (but less than $350). One of them is the Microsoft's
and the other one is Supersoft's Fortran compiler.

Hope this helps.

The easiest and most portable way that I know of, is to set up a
fully ambiguous FCB (all ?'s), and do a BDOS search for FIRST,
look at the directory entry at the default DMA buffer (i.e 80H),
then continue doing BDOS search for NEXT and examining the directory 
entry, until the function returns no more matches (i.e. all the file
names on the disk in the current user area have been shown).

	1 - Set up fully ambiguous FCB (all ?'s)
	2 - BDOS search for FIRST
	3 - If no match found, DONE
	4 - Examine the directory entry, update internal data
	5 - BDOS search for NEXT
	6 - If no match found, DONE
	7 - GOTO Step 4

One of the best documents I know which explains the directory entries
is the DU (Disk Utility) documentation. This program is in public
domain, and I would recommend you learn how to use it and understand 
the information it provides, before you start the project.

Good luck.

It is with sadness that I report the death of a fine gentleman and a most
dedicated amatuer computerist.  Al Plehn passed away on May 22nd after a long
illness.  He will be missed by those who knew him; there is now a void in our
lives.  For those of you who did not know Al, you have missed a grand oppor-
tunity to make contact with one of the best and most generous of us all.  He
was always concerned with the advancement of those around him, often to his
own discomfort and inconvenience.  He never let on that there was ever a
problem and always stepped forward to help.

Al was a professional electronics engineer.  He recently retired on disability
from CRC in Arlington, VA and spent his last few months promoting educational
values to those who most needed them.  He is missed.

He is survived by his wife, Ingrid and his son, Roland.  Those of you who feel
a need to express sympathy to the family can look up his particulars with the
familiar "WHOIS PLEHN."  Please note the regard for you all which he had 
foremost in his mind.

Sorry to be the bearer of sad news, but he is worth mentioning at least one
more time.

One word of caution on FORTRAN 77. People who use F77 on DEC machines
are spoiled. The F77 compiler on these machines is a SUPERset of the
language. I made the mistake of thinking that it was close to the
standard and estimated the development effort to convert some code from
a VAX to a Honeywell DPS 6/92. After finding out that much of the code
would not compile, I ordered the F77 standard document. I found that
the Honeywell just barely met the standard. Also, I found that FORTRAN
4+ on DEC machines was a nicer language than standard F77. The point
is that you should look at the features of the implementation and
not to assume that all F77 compilers are the same.

The  Microsoft  FORTRAN  compiler is FORTRAN-66 less COMPLEX data
types.  It is good, but it isn't F77.   Supersoft's  compiler  is
supposed  to be most of FORTRAN-77, and the second-hand reports I
have heard on it are fair to good.

You might try the Microsoft F66 compiler (which can be  had  very
cheaply  in CP/M formats like Heath) with a RATFOR pre-processor.
Software Toolworks sells RATFOR foa about $30-40.

Hope this helps.

Alun:

The "WordStar customization notes" are definitely *NOT* public domain.
MicroPro is asking for (or was at one time) something like $495 for them.
I have a copy that my office bought - they ain't even near worth it.

On the other hand, what I think you are looking for *is* available - a
list of all the patch points.  With the cursory info that in the manual,
most any compentent (read "not timid") can change W* to his liking.  The
copy that I last worked on is in simtel20, micro:<cpm.wstar>ws30pat.pts
or somthing like that.  (my list of filenames is elsewhere at the moment.)

There is address changes between the W* version 3.0 and 3.3, but the
labels have not changed!  The patch point lists contains both the absolute
addresses and the labels.  So be carefull.  The built-in W* patcher can
be accessed in W* 3.3 by giving a '+' to the main configuration menu of
the W* installer.  It is not on the menu.

They used to advertise in BYTE(tm) etc but I haven't looked lately.
The version you have would be the ST/S for S100 use. It is a 
microprogrammable controller for ST506 type drives. Early versions
supported 5mb drives but later they came out with 16's.

If you need more detailed information , feel free to contact me by
mail.

Isn't the Kaypro IV Z-80 based?  If so, MS-DOS can't run on it.

Brad - I can't speak for Kaypro, but one or two companies were advertising
add-on boards for Osbornes that would let you run MS-DOS.  The boards
had 8088's, memory, and all that kind of stuff.  Assuming that the Kaypro IV
only has a Z-80, then perhaps someone makes an 8088 add-on board.

NetLandians,

Nice article in the latest PC Tech Journal by John Figueras gave me an idea.
He reminds us that .COM files compiled by TurboPascal carry with them the
TurboPascal runtime library - slightly more than 10Kb for the PC version.

He suggests (and provides a wee little bit of code) that if we have a RUN
program and run .CHN type files, we can save a LOT of space if we have a LOT
of Turbo programs.  The RUN.COM will carry the 10Kb of runtime library, but
the .CHN files are nothing but pure code!

I grabbed ARGLIB.PAS from a TURBTOOL.LBR at DEC-MARLBORO (thanks, guys),
to provide handling the .CHN file name at the command line of CP/M, and the
whole mess can be found (available via ANONYMOUS FTP) from my directory,
ABN.ISCAMS, at my host, USC-ISID.ARPA.

File names are:
RUNCHN.PAS
TESTRUN.PAS  (in case you don't believe it)

Nice little utility.  I kept it simple (no handling of fancy parameters at
the command line, only RUNCHN FOOB (with the assumption that FOOB is really
FOOB.CHN, and FOOB.CHN doesn't expect any OTHER parameters handed to it!).

Lost the pointer to the Pascal guys on the net - if someone might forward
this (or an abbreviated extract) to them...

     I  called  Nite-Owl  software  and inquired  how  long  they 
estimated it would be until they came out with MEX  2.0.  Instead 
of telling me about 2.0, the kind sir told me all about MEX Plus. 
For  $50.00 you get many more features,  he says,  which are  all 
well  worth the money.  (BUT,  you don't get any manuals  because 
they have none printed.  They are, however, included on the disk, 
so no biggy.) You also get $40.00 towards any updates.

     All  of  the features he quoted sounded great.  Does  anyone 
have  any experience with it?  Is it worth buying if you get  the 
$40.00 credit towards MEX 2.0?

Subject: Request for help on CP/M SEARCH NEXT command

	I need some CP/M help from the experts out there.

	I am trying to use the FIND FIRST/FIND NEXT calls from CP/M.
I have looked at _The_ _Programmer's_ _CP/M_ _Handbook_ by Andy
Johnson-Laird.  On page 105, he has an example that uses these calls.
He uses FIND FIRST to refind the previous file name, then changes the
FCB to the ambiguous file name, and uses FIND NEXT to find the next
matching ambiguous file name.

	However, when I try that, it comes back with No Such File.
It does not search for the next match of the ambiguous file name, but
searches for another copy of the previous file name (I guess).
Since I cannot give an FCB address to FIND NEXT, I assumed that it
used the last FCB address given.  But changing that FCB does not matter;
it still does not find any files.

	A sample of the code follows:

		LXI     D,FCB           ;Get the FCB address
		CALL    ZEROFCB         ;Clear out all but disk, name, & type
		LXI     D,FCB           ;Get the FCB address
		MVI     C,SEARCHF       ;Get the code for search for first
		CALL    BDOS            ;Re-find the last file
		LXI     H,FCB+1         ;Get address of the FCB
		MVI     A,'?'           ;Change it to ambiguous
		MVI     C,11            ;Get size of name and type
	LOOP:   MOV     M,A             ;Store ambiguous file name
		INX     H               ;Increment to next position
		DCR     C               ;Decrement count
		JNZ     LOOP            ;Loop for all bytes in name and type
		LXI     D,FCB           ;Get the FCB address
		CALL    ZEROFCB         ;Clear out all but disk, name, & type
		LXI     D,FCB           ;Get the FCB address
		MVI     C,SEARCHN       ;Get code for search for next
		CALL    BDOS            ;Search for next file
		CPI     0FFH            ;See if file was found
		JZ      FILENOTFOUND    ;If not, then error

	(This is not the exact code, but this is essentially what I did
by using DDT)  I realize there is probably some really dumb error, but I
cannot get it to work.  It always comes back with reg A = 0FFH with the
file not found.  Yes, there are more files on the disk.

	Any ideas would be welcome and greatly appreciated.

The following is relayed from the author of NULU11:

From: Martin Murray
      Executive Director
      NULU Crisis Control Center
Re:   NULU 1.1 bug reports, et all

Salutations!

Q: Is there a bug in NULU11 when extracting large files?
A: Yes.  However, the bug has been verified by me in the following
   circumstances only:

1) Extracting from a library on a non-default drive to the
   default drive.
2) File must be larger than the file transfer buffer.
3) Verification by me of bug on Kaypro and Epson computers only.
4) Block size of 2K and less than 512K total disk capacity.

This DOES NOT MEAN that I am certain that the error exists nowhere
else.  This list of conditions merely represents several conditions
which I consider pivotal in the creation of the problem.  If you know
of others, please contact me.

It should be noted that extracting to the same drive as the one on
which the library resides causes no problem.  Additionally, if the
original source file can be completely read into memory (i.e. only
one pass is made at the source file) no problem will occur.

At present I plan no patch to fix the problem.  However, a new release
of NULU this summer should address the problem completely, as well
as offer additional NULU features.

Additional reports on problems that have been verified and can be
repeated are welcome.  Come one, come all.

to CP/M-86 about CLOCK

On the IBM PC version of CP/M-86, how does one access the clock from
an assembly language program? I want to be able to set it from my AST
6pak+ board. I have the routines to read the AST, but can't find any
documentation on setting the software clock, except via TOD.CMD.

Eat more bits...

  I am looking for information on two problems I am having with my Eagle II
(Z80, CP/M, etc).  First, does anyone know how I can modify the BIOS?  I have
tried modifying MOVCPM.COM and then building a new OS image with the modified
program, but when I SYSGEN it to a disk and cold boot, all I get is a error
message telling me that the software is not acceptable.
  Secondly, I would like to add another floppy or two to the system.  Can this
be done?  Can the bus handle this?  Will the BIOS have to be modified?  Does
Eagle publish any manuals (etc.) that would help me?
  Any help would be greatly appreciated.  Please respond to me by mail.

				Thanks...

The meaning of a usenet address (e.g. in my signature) with {a,b,c}!d!e is
that any of the sites a, b or c are "good" starting points, normally a
"well-known" backbone site within usenet.  If you know how to get to one of
these, you have the last parts of the route, which can be the hardest to
learn otherwise (especially with the current rate of growth of number of
sites).

The Kaypro IV is Z80 based, but it is possible to have an
MS-DOS board, with an 8088, memory, etc. piggybacked onto
it; this board is then an independent computer, which uses the
regular Z80 cp/m for the keyboard/screen interface, ports, etc.
 (which is why getting something like an MS-DOS modem program 
to run on one of these is quite a hassle).  The memory on the 
8088 based board can probably also be used as a Ramdisk for the
regular cp/m case, and so on.  One company making such a board for
the Kaypro is SWP Microcomputer Products, Fort Worth, TX.  They make
boards called CO-POWER 88, and CO-POWER + which offer a fair amount of
PC compatibility for Kaypros (even Lotus can be run).  The 8088 board
can also do CP/M 86.  Memory can be upto 1Meg for the + board, but
is limited to 256K for the 88.  I'm sure there are other such boards 
that can be used; I'd like to know if anyone has had good/bad 
experiences with any of these.

--cut here--TURBO3.TXT--cut here--
From: PHILIP BURNS

(Message from the SMUG BBS, Formerly SUGI/SIG, Rockville)


I received my copy of Turbo 3.0 today. I have only worked with it
for a few hours, but my initial impressions are extremely
positive:

 (1)  All the bugs I encountered in release 2.0
      have been fixed.

 (2)  The compiler is AT LEAST twice as fast as
      before.  For example, a 10000+ line program
      I have which used to take 9+ minutes to
      compile now compiles in less than four minutes.

 (3)  The generated code is substantially smaller --
      as much as 35% for some of my programs --
      and runs considerably faster.

 (4)  The editor appears to run much faster --
      nearly instantaneous screen updates, etc.

 (5)  The PC/DOS version (which I am using) includes
      standard procedures for directory access and
      manipulation.  In addition, file names may now
      contain drive/subdirectory information:
      a file name like 'C:\mydirec\myfile.dat' is now legal.

 (6)  The installation program allows you to define
      the drive/directory for the message file.
      No more having to have multiple copies strewn
      all over your disks!

 (7)  The are a number of system-interface
      procedures for getting command line arguments,
      defining a path for TURBO overlays, etc.

 (8)  There are a number of advanced graphics
      functions -- for generating circles,
      fill patterns, etc. -- as well a very nice
      implementation of Turtle graphics.

 (9)  Full I/O redirection on standard files is
      provided.  The run-time package also uses
      standard MS DOS file handles.

      NOTE:  THIS MEANS THAT TURBO 3.0 WILL ONLY RUN
             UNDER MSDOS/PCDOS RELEASE 2.0 OR LATER!

(10)  You can change buffer sizes for files.

(11)  You can open a file for append.

(12)  Text I/O is considerably faster -- especially
      with larger buffer sizes -- and a number of new
      procedures are available for manipulating text files.

(13)  External assembler procedures appear to work
      correctly now.

(14)  The BCD version provides nice editing facilities
      for numbers, which should ease writing
      business-oriented programs.

On the negative side, there are a few things still missing:

 (1)  Still no integer type > 16 bits.

 (2)  Still no out-of-block GOTOs.  (This hinders writing
      parsers using recursive descent.)

 (3)  The 8087 version still only supports the
      64-bit real -- no 32 bit reals, no 80 bit reals,
      no long integers, etc.

 (4)  There are quite a few errors in the published
      documentation. Hence, you MUST READ CAREFULLY the
      README file enclosed on the distribution disk.

One word of caution about Turbo 3.0 -- in fixing the EOLN and
related functions, Borland changed their function a little when
applied to Kbd.  If you apply EOLN to KBD, you'll find things
get a little behind -- there's a one-character delay.  This means
that if you wrote your own procs to process/edit input lines,
and you used EOLN(Kbd), then THEY WON'T WORK ANYMORE.  The easiest
fix is to check for a carriage return character and not bother
with the EOLN -- not exactly standard Pascal, but what the heck,
who cares anyway.

Keith:

Thank you for posting Philip Burns evaluation of MSDOS improvements.
There are no questions that if I had an IBMPC.clone, it would be a
worthwhile update.  However, there has been little information on
improvements for us miscreants who still use CPM80.  Tom.

  It's got some loose ends here and there and is still rough around

Yes, if you send precisely that address (user%site.uucp) to harvard.arpa
(so, user%site.uucp@harvard.arpa), the mail will be forwarded correctly.
This is due to the pathalias database that is kept on harvard.  Furthermore,
if you want to see the address (path), you can run "pathto site" (if your
site is running the pathto code I distributed in the fall), or simply
telnet harvard on port 117 and type the name of the site.

If you want the pathto stuff, I can send it to you.

P.S.  Note that this mailer is probably sending out incorrect return
	addresses (we are working on it).  You can reply to

Try VDO25.  It will handle files small enough to fit into its buffer
as it does not use the disk for a buffer.  It is configurable using an
install program which is included.  No source is available.

     Are you familiar with "nswp" (a public domain program for
CP/M-based micro's)?  How hard would it be to come up with a
UNIX-equivalent?
     "nswp" allows CP/M users to step through their directory, one
file at a time, and do various things (skip it, view it,
squeeze/unsqueeze, or tag it for "deletion" or "mass copy", etc.).
Users have menu-option at each file to "delete all tagged files",
"copy all tagged files", etc.
    A UNIX-version could allow for "mass file-archival" (vs. mass
copy) and (1) move tagged files to some directory which could serve as
the "pick-up point" for an archival utility (run weekly, for
example)...and (2) add a "ls -l" entry to the users' archival
directory (/usr/ARCHIVES) which would let the user keep track of what
he archived (ie, an index).
     Such a comprehensive UNIX program would really help Systems
Administrators manage user file-space.  Many users would clean up
their stuff if some tools was available to help them.  If nothing
else, just stepping them through their directory (file at a time) and
allowing them to "skip", "view", or "tag for deletion"; with a "delete
tagged files and exit" as a 4th option.
     What do you think?

Tom (et all),
Good question - IS there any significant improvement for the CP/M-80 version
3.0?  I'm using the very first (no serial number at ALL!) version (yep,
I bought JRT Pascal early too), and can live with the few documented bugs.

Don't need windows (I don't DO windows).

Turbo Pascal V2.0 does indeed handle recursion correctly if you set the
appropriate compiler directive. The latest Tug Lines has a list of all 
known bugs in the compiler and recursive use of Var parameters was not
one of them. V3.0 for CP/M does not buy you much more than a new manual.
(And the manual is somewhat more cryptic since some things that work
only on MS-DOS are not indicated as such.) I compared compile times and
code speed and came up with nearly identical numbers from 2.0 to 3.0.
New features are limited to SeekEOF, Exit, and some command line 
routines (although you are still limited to the first 32 bytes or
so of the command line, everything else gets trashed unless you have
the "patch" program) Not at all worth it. Borland, I suspect has been
caught up in the lure of big blue.

Subject: Coleco Adam Query
To: info-cpm@AMSAA.ARPA


Don't laugh, but is anyone out there doing anything
with the Coleco Adam? It (barely) qualifies for this
list because it apparently will run CP/M software with
the Enhancement-3 package.  The reason I'm asking is that
a retailer here in the DC area is selling the Adam
package (computer/tape drive/keyboard/letter-qual printer/
BASIC/WP SW/games) for $299.95, $200 less than the same
package went for at Xmastime when Coleco was still making
them and claiming that you were a bad parent if you
didn't buy your kid one.

If you want a modem, the AdamLink + comm SW runs $99.95.
They have other add-on goodies (incl the CP/M feature) 
which go for various multiples of $100.00.

I dunno...the base package doesn't look like
the worst deal I've ever seen. Any thoughts?

Now available from SIMTEL20:

Filename			Type	 Bytes	 CRC

Directory MICRO:<CPM.PACKET>
PACKET93.LBR.1			BINARY	219648  0C0BH

PACKET93.LBR contains the files that make up version 9.3 of the W0RLI
Packet Radio MailBox/BBS/GateWay system.

This system runs on the following hardware:

Computer:
	Xerox 820-1 computer (the ones that were available for $50,
			      and are still around for not much more),
	one or more 8" single density, single or double sided disk drives,
	parallel keyboard, CRT monitor.

Packet Radio gear:
	One or Two TAPR (or AEA) TNCs with version 3.1 or later software.
		(Two TNCs if you are going to run a crossband Gateway.)

Radio gear:
	One or two transceivers.

The W0RLI software supports sending, receiving and forwarding mail,
uploading and downloading files, capturing typescripts, logging
channel activity and mailbox activity, and gateway operation between
two TNCs on two bands.

Read the file NOTES.TNC to start working your way through the
documentation.

Hank would appreciate knowing of users who are running this software.
A QSL to Hank or a net message to me would be appreciated.

Here is Hank's update from the February 1985 NEPRA PacketEar:

   The MailBox/GateWay has now been sent to 25 states and 5 countries.
As far as I know for sure, it is on the air at least 20 places now. In
the Boston area, 4000 messages have passed through it. The local
forwarding network now includes 9 nodes: W0RLI, WB2OSZ, WB1DSW, K1BC,
WA2RRKN-2, K7PYK, WA4SZK, KA1T, W1AW-4. The last two run their own
software, but allow for forwarding from the W0RLI systems.

   A message put into any one of these systems will find its way to
the system nearest the intended recipient.

   There are several other areas of the country now using the
software:  Georgia, Arizona, Iowa, Washington DC, Seattle, ENY/NYC/NNJ,
Dallas, Illinois, Southern New Jersey, Los Angeles have all been heard
from. All have the software in daily use.

   Expect to see it on Oscar-10 at KL7GNG soon.

   Look for it from Australia, New Zealand, Japan, Hungary.

   Sacramento county RACES will be using it.

   GateWays are running at W0RLI, K7PYK, WA4SZK and WB7DCH.

These notes are rough, more release notes and tech notes than
anything else. A SYSOPS Manual (Very nice, 25 pages or so) is
available for 8-1/2 x 11 SASE ($1.24 postage) from:

I have included this on the release disk as LFA.COM.

Release notes, Version 9.3 :

In version 9.0, there was a change to the structure of the mail
file. When TNC is first run, it will update the mail file to
the new structure. This is done by doing an untangle. Don't panic
when this happens the first time you run version 9.3!

     Changes and additions since version 9.2 are:

Added privelege A and B, excluded on A or B ports.
Removed LA and LN, was bad idea.
Support for S W0RLI @ K1BC installed...
Added H local command: short / long menu (=Help).
Added $X, $Y, $Z : Date, time, current msg # at last login.
Verify for files specified in config.tnc that the drive
is on line and write enabled.
L now lists new, LN same, LA lists all.
Faster forward - send "S XXX" and title then eat 2 lines.

     Changes and additions since version 9.1 are:

Much faster untangle.
D, DP, DU for remote sysop.
CP ON/OFF and CR ON/OFF for remote sysop.

     Changes and additions since version 9.0 are:

"Remote sysop" feature added.
Better handling of user record currency.
Excluded user disconnected with no "bye" message.
Fixed bug - long packets not get monitored properly.
Added ki4xo changes for 5" to boot, sbios, cbios.
Added GM, GU, OA, OB, C <call>.

     Changes and additions since version 8.9 are:

Some changes to CBIOS thanks to ke1g give faster disk I/O
Added user privilege check. If E, then user is excluded from
use of the MailBox. N is used for normal user, and is default.
Fixed connect bug - now conok on is last sent, conok off is first.
Most searches go most recent first.
Added LL (List Last n), and LN (List New).
User file version 1, and DU - Display Users, EU - Edit Users.
Mail file structure version 2, back chaining of msg headers.
N menu item, rename file.

     Changes and additions since version 8.8 are:

Fixed (again) the disconnect process.
Added DP - page mode.
G menu item replaces UNTANGLE, GR to renumber the messages.
L and private msg, show only to owner/sender/addressee.

     Changes and additions since version 8.7 are:

Name of CONFIG.TNC file can be specified at execution time:
TNC OLDCFG.TNC or TNC NEWCFG.TNC for example. Defaults to CONFIG.TNC
if not specified.

The names for files CALLS.TNC, FWD.TNC, LOG.TNC specified in CONFIG.TNC
Installed ke1g improved cbios. Thank you Bill.
Y replaced by YC, YF, YL, switch calls, forward, or log files.
Fixed (I hope) the "Can't DISCONNECT, Link state is..." bug.
Added Z (delete file) to local menu.
X menu item forces forward regardless of hours given in FWD.TNC.
Was not passing "*** LINKED to" thru from next GateWay.
Not allow GateWay connect line with "tran" at end.

     Changes and additions since version 8.6 are:

Fixed (again!) the lack of timeout when bombarded with con req.
Added UA (append) option to local menu.
Fixed dayclock month rollover.
Split EDMSG, FWD, MBFILE as separate routines.

I'd really love to find a way to use some of those cheap 5MB hard
disks that are coming up on the market on my H89.   However,  the
only  way  that  seems  feasible  so  far  is  to  use a Magnolia
Heath-to-SASI card (which means changing from my  well-loved  and
debugged Heath CP/M) to drive a Xidex SASI-to-ST506 card to drive
the drive.  That isn't cheap!

Has anyone else out there tackled the hard disk and H89 and  come
up  with  a  good  fix?   Or  should  I  just settle down with my
floppies?

I am also interested in whether or not to upgrade from Turbo pascal 2.0 to 3.0 on a CP/M-80 machine (Kaypro 8).  I definately would suggest to David Kirschbaum that the upgrade to 2.0 was worth it if you work in an environment where ov
are useful (like on a small machine)

While we are on the subject, does anybody know if there is a ramdisk
driver for the PCPI applicard that works with the RAMWORKS card?  (I.e,
that uses the RAMWORKS memory for its ramdisk.)  Presumably if there were
one it would also work with the Apple 80 col card.  Please save me from
re-inventing the wheel.  If I can't buy one, I will have to write it
myself.

I have version 3.0 for CPM/80.  It is just as great as you have heard, but
they havent fixed the recursion bug.  From the sound of the manual, it looks
like they have no intention of fixing it, either.

	I have found where to get Xebec 30 Meg hard disk subsystems
for the incredible price of $1450.  The distributer who I'm in touch
with says that he will sell them in batches of n where n >= 20 for
$1450 each if I give him a certified check for $1450 * n. He says that
the list price for the system is $2590.

	Here are the specs:

Xebec 5.25" Winchester: 4 platters, 8 heads, voice coil driven head,
    average acces time of 45 msec (including settling), average
    latency of 8.33 msec, formatted capacity of 33.5 MB, 512
    cylinders.

Xebec S1410A controller: 22 bit error detection, 11 bit error
    correction.

Host adaptors available: IBM-PC, IBM-XT, and compatibles, (PC-DOS 1.1,
    2.0, 2.1, MS-DOS 2.0.) Apple ][+, //e, and compatibles, (Apple DOS
    3.3, ProDOS 1.0.1, Microsoft CP/M 2.23, PCPI CP/M 1.0, 1.5, 2.0,
    Apple Pascal 1.1.) and S100 bus. (CP/M presumably. [It's not on
    the specs sheet I have, but the distributer said there was an S100
    bus host adaptor available.])

Case: Height 5.00", width 6.62", depth 14.75", weight 16 pounds.

Power supply: 100-126, 220-240 VAC, 50/60 Hz, 60 W power consumption.

Cords, cables, and manuals are included. (It's ready to set up and use.)

	If you're insterested in going in on this with me, send me
mail ASAP so I can see what sort of a response there is. If you send
me mail saying you're interested in getting one, or might be, I will
keep you posted. I hope it is clear that I am not making any profit
off of this.

The program you describe is what the "dired" routine in Emacs should have
done, but never did.  i have a stand-alone version that meets most of your
specs running under VAX/VMS.  It would require a few changes to the routines
that parse the directory files, but could be made to run under Unix.  i was
thinking of building Xlisp into it, so users could write their own filters,
etc.  It is/was a fun project, but i find that as long as i can wildcard
the system's copy, move,delete, and type commands, it is faster
to work without the Diredit program.

	Hope I can help all the Otrona users out in net land. When Otrona
went under they had a liquidation sale, and I have purchased some of their
parts.( power-supplies, main 8 bit boards, 16 bit boards, videos, etc.)
I am willing to help all those in need of repair, to get up and running
again. I have also purchased some of their Documentation, both hardware and
software. If interested please contact me and I will see what I can do. I also
am able to work on those old Remex drives, or have a replacement for them.

      No argument from me.  By the way, have you seen the Amiga yet?  I

      It's got some loose ends here and there and is still rough around

I've gotten  awfully  used to using EMACS (on VAX/VMS) here at work. So used
to  it,  in  fact,  that I've looked into EMACS-like editors for CP/M-80, so
that I can feel [nearly] as comfortable at home too.

I've got  copies of several articles/reviews on MINCE (MINCE Is Not Complete
EMACS), which  paint  a  rather nice picture of an editor more like what I'd
like  to  have.  MINCE is also usually described in concert with SCRIBBLE, a
text processor which also sounds desirable.

Recently however,  I  called  Mark of the Unicorn to learn about pricing and
availability,  and learned that they're no longer supporting either MINCE or
SCRIBBLE,   but   refered  me  to  their  two  distributors.  One  of  their
distributors  didn't  think  that  MINCE  ran  on  CP/M-80,  and didn't have
SCRIBBLE. Neither of the distributors were really sure that the C source for
the  MINCE  commands  (available to allow user customizing) was available as
part of the package, as it has been in the past.  Well informed folks.

Mark of  the  Unicorn's  FINAL  WORD doesn't run on CP/M-80 as I recall, and
from  the reviews it seems to have changed enough from MINCE+SCRIBBLE that I
don't think it's what I want.

Which leads me to my questions.

Is there  anyone out there who uses MINCE (and SCRIBBLE), and who might have
comments about either? What's performance like? Where, and how long ago, did
you get  it/them?  How difficult is MINCE to customize? How much of EMACS is
left  out?  Any  word on whether or not, if Mark of the Unicorn is no longer
supporting  MINCE  or  SCRIBBLE (since they're pushing FINAL WORD, now), the
sources to MINCE and SCRIBBLE might be available?

I've already started, but if I can get away with not writing my own....

I think there are two different points being addressed here.  One refers
to the CP/M-80 limitation that local variables may not be passed as
VAR parameters in a recursive procedure.  This is an implementation
deficiency rather than a bug - it is documented on page 319 of the
3.0 manual.  The second point refers to the fact that the default
condition for the CP/M-80 version of Turbo generates non-recursive
code.  To turn on the generation of recursive code, you must use
the A compiler directive.  See page 318 of the 3.0 manual.  However,
even when recusive code generation is turned on, you may still NOT
use local variables as VAR parameters in recursive calls.

Also, I think that Version 3.0 is worth upgrading to.  The addition
of the EXIT statement alone is a boon for people porting code from
the UCSD P-System environment. And, as pointed out in the V1#5 issue
of TUG LINES, there were quite a few bugs fixed.

Contrary to your comment about the MotU's Final Word, it DOES run on CP/M-80
systems.  I have a copy and use it on an Apple //e with the Premium Softcard.
Granted, I don't use it very often, but it does work.  The reason I got it
was it was the only package with support for "true" proportional spacing on
a Diablo 1650 printer.  I now use WordStar and do the final printing with a
fantastic package called MagicBind/MagicIndex.

Cheers,
Bud Huber

I have a problem for which I would appreciate some advice.

I have a home micro, a Memotech MTX machine with the manufacturer's CP/M
dual-floppy upgrade.  The CPU lives in the same case as the keyboard:  this
case (hereafter, the MTX unit) is therefore connected to the floppy box
(hereafter, the FDX unit) via a 60-way ribbon cable.  From the back of the
MTX unit, there are also the power cable, the printer cable and the modem
cable.

The MTX unit is about the same size as a typical detachable keyboard.
Except, of course, with all these leads attached to it, it isn't detachable
in any real sense.

Now, I feel more at home when I can move a keyboard around.  Add to this the
fact that I'm not entirely happy with the feel of the present keyboard.  I
can see several possible solutions to the problem.

1.	Remove everything from the MTX unit except the keyboard; put these
	guts into another case, which will sit underneath the FDX unit, and 
	then connect the keyboard in the MTX case to the new case with a fair
	length of cable.  The keyboard PCB is attached to the main PCB via a
	20-pin connector, so it looks as if I won't find a coiled cable to
	do the job.  Other friends have recommended only ribbon cable as
	suitable anyway.

	But .. ribbon cable is not as flexible as one might desire, and is a
	touch unsightly; and I still have the keyboard I'm not in love with.


1a.	As above, but remove and replace all the keyswitches with ones that
	feel nice.  Gets me a nice keyboard, but means burning my fingers
	with a soldering iron in a big way.


2.	Find an alternative keyboard that will be compatible with the 20-pin
	connection used, sit the entire MTX unit under the FDX unit and then
	connect the new keyboard to where the old one was connected.  

	Potentially gets me a keyboard I like, but still unsightly, inflexible
	ribbon.  Also, I'm told that my chances of getting a keyboard that is
	compatible at this level are very low (still trying to get information
	out of reluctant manufacturers).


3.	Buy a nice serial keyboard, and connect it to one of my RS232 ports;
	write an appropriate driver for it and hack the BIOS so that this
	port is read instead of the normal keyboard port.  I don't even know
	if this is possible:  although I'm a fairly competent programmer, I
	haven't mucked about with bits like this (I do my programming on
	real machines :-)).  I'm much happier with software than hardware,
	so I would prefer this solution provided it doesn't involve too much
	work.

	This could get me a very nice keyboard and a flexible cable.


So:  any ideas?  Yes, I know I should have tried the keyboard more before I
bought it.  Please don't tell me to sell the thing:  it has some nice
software, and I don't think I'd get much for it in these 16-bit days.

All suggestions, comments etc. very gratefully accepted.

Mince and Scribble for CP/M-80 live on as Perfect Writer and Perfect
Formatter (respectively), and used to come standard with Kaypros.  I don't
know if Kaypro still furnishes the (im)Perfect family.   Unfortunately, 
source is not available for the Perfect versions.  You can do some 
limited customization by rebinding keys and telling it a bit about your 
printer (but you can't get superscripts and subscripts unless your printer
is one of the `supported' models-- no way to write your own driver for 
others).

Subject: Racal-Vadic VA3451 Modem Problem
Cc: CIC@csnet-sh.ARPA, DDUSTMAN@csnet-sh.ARPA, LONG@csnet-sh.ARPA, 
    MOOERS@csnet-sh.ARPA

In order to get connected to the CSNET PhoneNet, we bought a Racal-Vadic
VA3451 Auto-Dial modem.  The modem was delivered in early 1985, and the
manual that came along with it was entitled "VA3451 Modem Installation/
Operation Manual", "Initial Issue", "November, 1984".  There appears to
be an problem with the modem and an error in the manual.

After we put the modem into service, it occasionally got itself into a
funny state.  The modem was off-hook even though there was no connection,
and the modem was generating a carrier.  The lights that were lit were:
HS, DSR, and DTR.  Further, disconnecting the modem from its DTE by
removing the RS232 plug (thereby dropping DTR) did not cause the modem to
go on-hook.  Neither did unplugging the modem from the phone line.  It
was possible to force the modem to go on-hook either by toggling power or
by flipping the DA/VO/MA switch on the front panel away from VO and then
back.

I telephoned the Racal-Vadic Service Hotline, and we tried a several
months worth of different things, but nothing would make the problem go
away.

On Wednesday, 5/29/85, Diane Dustman, CSNET-CIC Technical Staff, phoned
me to tell me that our modem was off-hook.  She asked me to reset the
modem so that CSNET-RELAY could begin to call our host again.  I told
her that I knew about the problem and that I was working on it.  I asked
her if she often had to telephone site liaisons asking for a modem to be
reset.  She said that she sometimes did, but that it didn't strike her
as a widespread problem.  In any case, she mentioned my problem to Dan
Long, CSNET Technical Liaison, and it jogged his memory.  He sent on to
me something he had received in early 1984.

It was an article, signed by "--Lauren--", that had been distributed to
the INFO-MICRO, INFO-CPM, UNIX-WIZARDS, and TELECOM interest groups.
Charles Lindahl at "ti-csl" (Texas Instruments Central Research Labs in
Dallas) had forwarded the article to Dan Long.  Briefly, the article
described exactly the problem that we were experiencing with our modem.
The article said that the fix involved changing the strapping so that
the A1 switch was OFF.  The setting of the A1 switch is ignored, and A1
is considered as ON, if the modem is set to its "Standard Configuration"
via the A6 switch.  The article said that A6 should be set to ON in
order to turn off the "Standard Configuration", i.e., to enable all the
other switches.

I had set A6 to the non-"Standard Configuration" setting, but according
to my manual, that setting was achieved with A6 OFF, not ON as was
indicated in the article.  The fact that the manual I have is wrong was
verified by a Racal-Vadic Field Service representative.  I will forward
a copy of this to him, in order to be sure that the error in the manual
is corrected.

Unfortunately, I cannot tell you yet that, by setting A6 to ON and A1
to OFF, our problem has been solved.  I had mailed the modem back to
Racal-Vadic for repair just before I got the information from Dan Long.

In any case, I would like to express my thanks to Diane, Dan, Charles,
and Lauren for getting this information to me.

The Final Word certainly does run on CPM/80. About 2 years ago I used Final
Word to create a manual for a product. It was running on TurboDOS with slave
Z-80 boards. There are several differences between it an the 16 bit version
but it is definately the best program on CPM/80 to generate a manual. It
worked flawlessly with a Qume printer and proportional spacing.
