The current versions of sb and rb, *nix programs supporting XMODEM,
YMODEM, and YMODEM Batch file transfers, have been posted to
net.sources.  Recent changes include support for BSD 4.2 and SYS V
terminal control conventions.  Compared to the last version of UMODEM
examined, rb and sb load the CPU less because of multi-character
terminal i/o operations.

In additon, YMODEM 1k packets (supported by YAM, MEX, PibTerm, IMP,
etc.) give greater throughput than XMODEM.  For example, at 9600 bps,
an otherwise idle PC-AT Xenix downloads to Pro-YAM with YMODEM-g twice
as fast as it does to Crosstalk XVI 3.6 with XMODEM.  This disparity
increases with transmission speed and system response time.

YMODEM batch transfers can also preserve the exact file length and
modification time.

VMS versions of these programs are also available, and will be posted
when a terminal mode problem unique to VMS version 4 is corrected.

Enjoy.

   I think there was a discussion on this before, but I have noticed the
problem for the first time on my Hayes recently.  When connected to a
system, the modem will (at random) send out "UUUUUUUUUU"'s and go offline.
I can resolve this by quickly unplugging the phone line and plugging it
in fast enough to keep the connection -- the modem is back to normal then
and I am returned to the system.  I can only suppose that this is some
sort of test pattern for the Hayes.

   I am using MEX usually when this happens, but it has occurred once or
twice in another terminal program as well.

   Any explanations and/or solutions would be appreciated;  mail me directly,
I am not on info-cpm.  Thanks.

   How can I get around the problem of trying to install EZCPR on a system

Apple system (MicroSoft-Compatible CP/M), where the CCP is 2000H higher
(is this correct?) than normal.  If that's not correct, I do know that
there is a difference in the CCP somewhere.  When I run SYS215.COM, it
tells me "CCP Not Located", and EZCPR cannot locate the CCP.  How can I
get around this problem?

Drew (et al),
You aren't the only one to experience this little Hayes "UUUUUUUU"
phenomenom .. a net buddy and I occasionally link thru our local TAC
and distant mainframe host.  He uses a Hayes modem.  On occasion (and we
canNOT identify any unique trigger), he blows away with a stream of "UUU"s.
I'm still on the net, but he's gone!  Gotta tell him about toggling the
on/off switch or whatever since to date we've been stymied, and the local
TAC wizards swear innocence (and you KNOW what the mainframe operators had
to say about us micro users...).

Sure don't have an explanation, though .. and would be most interested in
the answer when/if you get one!

I hesitate to mention this, because I'm sure someone's already said it
and I haven't seen it yet.  But...

That UUUUU pattern you see is what happens when a modem which
communicates in dibits (as does the Hayes) loses carrier.  [Thus your
1200 bits-per-second modem is actually 600 baud, since each change of
signal corresponds to a cartesian product of two one-bit quantities,
(generally either phase and frequency or phase and amplitude---I don't
recall which---each have two possible states, so you can combine them
four ways to get a dibit) which means each change of signal can
transmit two bits simultaneously.  Anyway, 'nuff on that.]

ASCII U is alternating ones and zeros, and the "no-carrier" state
looks like the dibit for 01.  Thus, you get a few UUU's and then the
modem recognizes it has lost carrier.  My VA3451 does that whenever
the foreign system drops carrier on logout, for example.

As for *why* one modem sees carrier dropped, I can't help you.

Pretty rugged, too - you could drop kick it a few times and still have

we just purchased (and are seriously considering returning) an Access
Matrix.  We understand that the manufacturer has gone out of business
but the price was right.

however, we're having lots of problems with the software.  CP/M didn't
include DDT or ASM.  And application programs that were supplied don't
run as documented (for example, Telcom+ doesn't give the menu that it's
supposed and pfont (a variant of fancy font) reports that its loading...
and then exits immediately to CP/M).

is this to be expected or is my package worse than normal?

what i really need is a communications package that works for this beast.
any clues?

soon after, i need to know what's inside the i/o space and where to find it.
anyone have schematics and/or hardware descriptions of this computer?

Dear INFO-CPM;

I have a KAYPRO II [-turned-into-a-IV via MicroCornucopia] that I
want to use to talk to my new Kaypro 2000.  Feeling comfortable
using Kermit to pass files to and from the MILNET and a DARPA
IBM-PC, I would like to use it for my CPM-pc to/from IBM-pc file
transfers.  I have a useable copy of MS-KERMIT, and would like one
to work on my CPM machine.
	While I am willing to try most anything, I need some
more-precise directions than most of your INFO-CPM readers might.
Please don't tell me "do an anonymous FTP to SRI and get ..." .  I
need reasonably explicit directions on how to get from the MILNET
to SIMTEL20 (if that is where some needed file resides) and how to
drag it back out to a file at my MILNET address.

SECOND QUESTION:

	Is there a public domain disk drive control program like
Uniform for the Kapro II/IV machines to read IBM data disks?  I
don't need generality, just a way to load IBM 5 inch disks down
onto my Kaypro 2000's 3 inchers.  Having a perfectly good set of
5 inch DSDD drives on a Kaypro IV makes one think that there
should be a simple [or at least cheap] solution.

	If anyone cares to answer, could you info me at my ARPA-net
[MILNET] address as well as the bboard.  Thanks,
Yours, etc.,
ralph chatham

I have a very strange problem in CP/M 80. Does any guru out there know
what could cause:

- A directory looks fine using DIR or public domain variants that I know
of (e.g. D)
- If I do 'stat *.*' however, a file shows up twice in the directory.
- A CB-80 program seems to semi-randomly get one or the other copy of the
file
- the file duplicates itself sometime during execution of the CB-80 program
(a big accounting package)

Questions:
   1) What could cause the difference between DIR and STAT?
   2) Could this problem be caused by a bug in:
   - CP/M (this is running on a Molecular)
   - CB-80
   - A programmer's error

   Any answers would be much appreciated! (Please mail, don't post. If

Ralph,
	To do newwork file transfers, you probably will have to find an FTP
gugru at your site.   Since there are almost as many versions of the FTP pro-
gram as there are sites, you will have to get some local help.  This is the
real reason  that most of the instructions are so vauge -- they have to be
to cover all cases.  In addition, learning how your version of FTP interacts 
with the remote FTP is also interesting.  However, since I am a Simtel user,
let me know if you have direct questions about files on Simtel.

	To solve your disk transfer problems, there are two ways to go about 
things: 1), use a serial file transfer (over RS-232) program such as MODEM7,
MEX (my favorite) or Kermit, or 2) add a 5" drive to the 2000 (external of
course) and simply copy from disk to disk.  Method 2 is definitely the pre-
ferred way if possible (not sure, haven't tried it) but is more expensive.
Method 1 needs only a willing computer with 5" drives, an appropriate RS-232
cable and compatible transfer programs.  Again, due to the number of details,
try to find a local guru, but if you get stuck, give a yell.

Some confusion has been reported concerning the compile time
options needed for the rb and sb programs recently posted
to net.sources.

For V7 and Berkeley systems (2.8 to 4.3), use -DV7

For SYS III and SYS V, use -DUSG

Those with Regulus, Coherent, Venix systems should examine the #ifdef's
in the files to determine the best compile time option to use.

What I have is special purpose, but indications are that there is
more out there.

The current software suite provided by AMPRO for Little Boards includes
a program called DOS.COM which allows you to set up one of the Little
Board drives as a DOS drive.  You can then transfer files from a CPM disc
to a DOS disc and back.  AMPRO disc format is not quite Kaypro, but they
are fairly close (I can read Kaypro discs too).  The program was released
to AMPRO by Paul Bartholomew (NFI).  It is copyrighted, not public domain.

Hope this helps some.

Is anybody familiar with "C/NIX"?  I received a catalogue from  SPITE
SOFTWARE, Portland, OR, with the following ad:

    C/NIX adds most of the power of Unix to any CP/M 2.2 system.  C/NIX
    features include named hierarchical directories, redirectable I/O, and
    many of the commands and utilities of Unix (ls, cd, mkdir, tree, walk,
    grep, etc.)  Even on-line Help!  [...]  You can even turn on a "log"
    file, which captures everything that appears on the screen and places it
    in a file.  [...]  Even with all these features, you can still use DIR,
    TYPE, PIP or any other operatings system utilities you have become
    familiar with.  At $59.95, C/NIX is a remarkable package.  It's a big
    package though, and we recommend it for daily use only for those with
    double-sided or hard disks.

Apparently they have it available for Morrow, Kaypro, Epson QX-10,
Osborne Exec, Osborne 1, and a few others.

Anybody any experience with this?  Is it as good as it sounds?  I sure
wouldn't mind a couple of Unix features on my CP/M, but at $59.95 I'm
afraid it's going to be a kind of trivial product...?

Chuck, the man page for sb makes no mention that Unix new lines will
NOT be converted when downloading ascii files.  rb apparently has no
provisions for stripping CRs on uploads.  This is probably due to the
fact that if batch up/downloads are done, a global convert is
undesirable since binary and ascii files MAY be mixed.

Some mention should be made of utilities such as "unixcpm" and
"cpmunix" to handle such files.

sb's attempt to restore the tty after the transfer (i.e., un-do the
raw) results in a lock-up condition on BRL Unix 4.2 BSD.  This MAY be
due to the fact that I'm accessing BRL through a TAC.  I had to reset
the connection and log in again.

Peter, CP/M is dumb when it comes to keeping directory entries.  It
does not check to see if a file by that name already exists before
allowing you to create a new one.  You as the user are expected to
check first to see if it exists, delete it if it does, then make the
new file.  Otherwise you will end up with two or more files by the
same name.

Also make sure that you do a proper close on any open files
before exiting your program.  Otherwise the directory will not be
updated and any pending characters in the deblocking buffer will not
be written to the file.

I want to correct some information.  The Libes' are not running M/SJ out of
their garage.  They are running it out of their basement.  I should know -
it is impossible to play ping-pong anymore with the production department
doing pasteup on top of it.  Also, the last time I was home, the room my
bed was in no longer looked like my old bedroom but was referred to as the
Circulation/Advertising Depts and Administrative Offices.  (To complete the
picture, the den is the Editorial Dept.)  

Though I don't ordinarily read it, I picked up a copy of Creative Computing
which ZD just closed.  Dave Ahl wrote a very polite editorial considering
the situation.  He was also quite blunt, however.  It was very anguishing
to read his own job-wanted ad at the end of his column.  

What really galls me is that there are still subscription cards, request
for reader response, advertising rates, etc in the magazine, even though
the issue cover was marked "collector's item", so they obviously knew
months ahead that it would be closed.

I have a Morrow M-20 (aka Decision I) computer with an 8 inch DD floppy
and 8 inch 20 megabyte hard disk.  This is an S-100 computer, not a
MicroDecision or other single board computer.

I am looking to discuss assembly language level programming of the
Morrow hardware such as the Real Time Clock on the Multi-I/O board, the
13 Bit printer port, etc.   Also to discuss BIOS fixes and bugs.

If I get any response, I'll post or mail a summary.

My apologies for being so late with this, but finally
I have posted my Emacs setup file for the MIX Editor.

This setup is by no means perfect, and I am sure many of you
will have better ideas on how I did some of the conversions.
If you do make changes, I would like to know so that my 
setup can be updated.

My wish list --

1. You still have to type the file name to exit MIX (^X ^F),
since I did not modify the editor to use a variable
to keep the file name.

2. I would like to fix delete line (^K) but too many troubles
with the MIX =JL command. Any ideas?

3. Blank compression is still a problem.  I have turned it 
off in this setup.

Enjoy, and keep me informed.  Thanks.

Is CPM dead?  It sure seems so.  I have seen all sorts of ad's for
CPM programs to hack with: command processors, compilers, terminal
emulators, file transfer programs, debuggers, etc, etc.  But, there
are vary few (none?) ad's for programs useful to the non-hacker.
Contrast this with the wealth of programs available for the IBM PC
and Apples.  Does this mean that this dust collector on my desk
is forever useless?  Can anyone here point me in the direction of
one or more programs that I can use to:
1) Record and handle my personal checkbook.  One that is as easier
   to use than the regular manual methods, not harder and slower.
   I am not particularly interested in summary reports or graphs.
2) Maintain and printout my mailing and phone list.  I would like to
   be able to printout just the phone numbers periodically as a
   useful thing to have by each phone, and printout the addresses
   around Christmas to serve as mailing labels.
3) A typing tutor program for my kids.  One just like the one for the
   VIC-20 that presents exercises and scores the results and advances
   in difficulty in an intelligent manner (finger group by finger group).
4) Educational programs that drill in reading, spelling, arithmetic,
   geography, science, etc. for ages 6 and up.
5) For my hacking self: an emacs that is emacs (or mods to MINCE that make
   it look more like emacs), a roff that works (nothing fancy), a yearly
   budget planner that has the categories already worked out, a desk
   calculator that can be brought up quickly and is easy to use.

I am willing to pay for these programs, they don't have to be public
domain - aren't there others that need them, too?   I have SuperCalc,
dBase II, BDS C, PILOT, various BASICS and assemblers, and know how
to use them (but don't want to).  We have WordStar and that is fine
for letters, reports, and such - the only useful program I have on
the machine.       Mel Haas  ,  [ihnp4!]odyssey!mel  ,  houxa!mel1

                            THE SIMTEL20 ARCHIVES



SIGNIFICANT CHANGES

     Files moved:  A new large disk device called PD: has been installed to
house the entire public domain software collection.  All files are now
accessible using file specifications of the form:

			PD:<directory_name>file_name

Example:

			PD:<CPM.STARTER-KIT>LU310.COM


     New logical names:  Files in the <CPM> archive can also be specified with
a new shortened notation using a logical name for each directory.  Thus, the
file in the above example can also be specified as:

			STARTER-KIT:LU310.COM

Note that the part of the directory name following the dot has been used as
the logical name (followed by a colon).  But remember, this new form of file
specification applies only to the <CPM> archive.  To avoid confusion, all
examples in the text to follow will use the PD: specification, as this form
works with ALL of the archives.


     Getting started:  The above example provides a sneaky introduction to yet
another new feature that should greatly ease the "bootstrap phase" for new
archive users.  Now in one place, PD:<CPM.STARTER-KIT>, you will find all of
the basic essentials needed to begin using the archives.  These programs
provide the means for transferring, unsqueezing and de-librarying archive
files, and more will be said about them later in this document.  Special kudos
to archive maintainer Keith Petersen for this worthwhile addition.


     Finally, a reminder:  For quite some time now, "ITS binary format" has
not been used for storage of binary files in the SIMTEL20 archives.  If you
are a new user of the archives and you don't know what ITS binary format is,
don't worry about it; it no longer matters.  But apparently, some "veteran
archive users" are still unaware of the change.  Therefore, please note that
stripping the first four bytes of binary files, once necessary for removal of
the special "ITS header", is no longer required.  Indeed, if you do this now,
YOU WILL DESTROY THE FILES.



OVERVIEW

     There is a collossal amount of free public domain CP/M, PCDOS/MSDOS and
UNIX software in several archives on SIMTEL20.ARPA, a DECsystem-20 running the
TOPS-20 operating system at White Sands Missile Range.  There is also a
relatively new archive of software for the DoD standard programming language,
Ada.  Archives of correspondence for several newsgroups, including INFO-CPM,
are also available.

     You can obtain these files using the InterNet file transfer protocol, FTP
(described in a following paragraph), with user-name "anonymous".  For a login
password, use your host-name or any other string of printing characters.
Throughout this message, FTP examples are given in a GENERIC syntax.  You will
have to consult either local documentation or your friendly system wizard to
learn the actual syntax used with your local mainframe operating system.  For
the sake of brevity, the domain suffix ".ARPA" will be dropped from further
references to SIMTEL20 in this discussion.

     To obtain directory listings, connect to SIMTEL20 via FTP and do this:

                get pd:<cpm>cpm.crclst 
                get pd:<cpmug>cpmug.crclst 
                get pd:<sigm>sigm.crclst 
		get pd:<pc-blue>pc-blue.crclst 
		get pd:<unix>unix.crclst 
		get pd:<ada>ada.crclst

The <CPM> archive is the one to watch for the very latest CP/M offerings, as
it is updated frequently.  The <CPMUG>, <SIGM> and <PC-BLUE> archives contain
software distributed by the CP/M Users Group, the SIG/M Users Group and the
PC-Blue Users Group respectively.  This software is available on diskettes
from the associated users groups, and the archives are updated as new volumes
are issued.  The <PC-BLUE> archive contains software for the IBM-PC and similar
machines.  Some runs under CP/M, and some under PCDOS/MSDOS.  The <UNIX>
archive contains a variety of UNIX tools.  Those which apply specifically to
CP/M are in the directory <UNIX.CPM>.  The <ADA> archive is growing rapidly.
Information about this archive is in directory PD:<ADA.GENERAL>.  Files in all
of these archives can be obtained using the FTP procedures described in this
message.

     There are many overlaps in the first three archives, but where
duplications occur, you will usually find the latest versions in the <CPM>
archive.  In general, the archived software is very good, having been worked-
over and refined by many users.  The documentation and comments tend to be
complete and informative.

     But please note that due to the large number of files available, the
archive maintainers cannot possibly attempt to validate the proper operation
of the various programs.  When a program bug is reported, immediate action is
taken to either correct the error or remove the offending program from the
archives.  Still, users must understand that all archive programs are offered
AS IS, and the archive maintainers specifically disclaim any liability should
these programs malfunction or cause damage, incidental or otherwise.  When
testing ANY new software, be certain that all information stored on disk is
backed-up before you start, so that you can recover if files are damaged or
erased.  This is particularly true if you have a hard disk, in which case
malfunctions can be spectacularly disasterous.



FILE TYPES

     Files are stored in two formats:  Text files such as those with names
that end with DOC, HEX, INF and ASM are sometimes stored as ASCII files, but
usually these files are stored in binary squeezed form.  Binary storage is also
used for executable (COM) and library files.  Squeezed and library files are
described below.  All binary data are stored as four 8-bit bytes per 36-bit
SIMTEL20 word, with the low-order four bits of each word filled with zeros.
If such a file is interpreted as a contiguous string, as will happen if a
straight binary transfer is made to a 16 or 32-bit UNIX machine, the four zero
filler-bits per 36-bit group will cause rather bizarre and frustrating results.
The methods for dealing with this situation, which differ from machine to
machine, are explained in a following paragraph.

     Squeezed files have been compressed using programs available in directory
<CPM.SQUSQ> to obtain an approximate 35-percent size reduction.  These files
can be identified by the letter Q in the extension field.  For example, the
file PD:<CPM.ASMUTL>RMACPAT.AQM is a squeezed file.  It must be transferred
as a binary file, and then unsqueezed.  The unsqueezing can be done on a CP/M
system using USQ-xx.COM (where "xx" is the current version) from directory
<CPM.SQUSQ>, or there are several host-based unsqueezers in the <CPM> and
<UNIX> archives (see for example, directories <CPM.TOPS-20> and <UNIX.CPM>).

     CP/M library files (those with names ending in LBR) combine several
regular CP/M files into a single BINARY file which contains an internal
directory of its contents.  They are created using the CP/M library utility
LUxxx.COM (where "xxx" is the current version) or some other compatible
utility.  The complete packages for LUxxx and a newer compatible program
called NULUxx (where "xx" is the version) can be found in directory
PD:<CPM.CPMLIB>.  C-language source code for a compatible UNIX utility
called LAR (library archiver) is in directory PD:<UNIX.CPM>.

     Although the type of storage used for a particular file can usually be
inferred from the file-name, this is not always true.  It is a good idea to
check the appropriate "crclst" file to ascertain the storage format used for
each file of interest.  Now, and for the foreseeable future, storage formats
for files in the <SIGM>, <CPMUG> and <PC-BLUE> archives can be determined from
their "generation numbers", as shown by the FTP directory command.  For
example, the FTP command:

		dir pd:<pc-blue.vol001>

will yield results of the form:

		-CATALOG.001.2
		ABSTRACT.001.2
		BW.ASM.2
		BW.BAS.1
		BW.EXE.1
		COLOR.ASM.2
		COLOR.BAS.1
		COLOR.EXE.1
		...and so on

All files with names ending in ".1" are stored in binary format, and those
with names ending in ".2" are stored in ASCII.  This relationship will
continue to apply for files in the <SIGM>, <CPMUG> and <PC-BLUE> archives
until further notice.

     WARNING:  Because the public domain archives on SIMTEL20 consume a huge
amount of disk-space, storage capacity will be conserved by the greatest
practical use of libraries and squeezed files, both of which are stored in
binary format.  If you cannot properly transfer binary files, you are going to
be VERY FRUSTRATED!  If you need help, please contact your local system wizard
and provide him/her with a copy of this message.  Having done that, if you are
still unable to make things work correctly, send a message to INFO-CPM-REQUEST
at AMSAA.ARPA and I will try to help you.  Please provide the following
information:

	1. Machine and operating system  (e.g., VAX-11/780, 4.2 BSD UNIX)
	2. Network software in use  (e.g., 3-Com UNET)
	3. Complete list of available FTP commands  (e.g., GET, PUT, etc.)

     Important files in the <CPMUG> and <PC-BLUE> archives are the CATALOG
files.  These files, which are stored in ASCII, contain the "-CATALOG.nnn"
files from all the volumes of their respective archives.  To obtain these
composite catalog files, connect to SIMTEL20 via FTP and do this:

		get pd:<cpmug>cpmug.cat 
		get pd:<pc-blue.vol000>pcblue.cat 

A similar file exists for the <SIGM> archive, but it is stored in squeezed
form.  This file, when unsqueezed, yields SIG.CAT (the catalog).  It can be
obtained using the FTP command:

		get pd:<sigm.vol000>sig.cqt

(NOTE: That's "L-and-three-zeros" in "vol000")



FILE TRANSFER VIA FTP

     FTP stands for File Transfer Protocol, a formalized procedure for moving
files among machines on the Defense Data Network (DDN) and other networks that
connect with the DDN.  The protocol is implemented by a program often called
FTP.  The different mainframe operating systems implement FTP with variations
in command syntax.  Some systems have the remote-file-name precede the local-
file-name in the command.  Others reverse this order.  Some versions have the
whole command on a single input line, while others use multiple lines.  Read
the documentation for your local system, or consult a friendly system wizard
for the details of your local FTP command syntax.

     UNIX users can do something like "man ftp" for on-line instructions.
However, not all UNIX FTP programs are called "ftp", so you may have to snoop
around in the system directories or ask a system wizard for the correct local
name to use with the "man" command.  ITS users can do ":INFO FTP", and  "HELP
FTP" works on TOPS-20 and some other operating systems.  I will be happy to
update this message with pointers to other sources of on-line documentation if
they are sent to INFO-CPM-REQUEST@AMSAA.ARPA.

     FTP transfers from SIMTEL20 can be made with user-name "anonymous".  Use
your host-name or any other string of printing characters for a password.  For
anonymous logins, SIMTEL20 supports the FTP "change working directory" command.
(Your local syntax may be something like CD, or CWD.)  Ignore the message that
prompts you to enter a password.  This command allows you to specify a default
SIMTEL20 directory to be used for all file retrievals, and thereby relieves you
from having to repeatedly type "pd:<whatever>" as part of each filename.  For
example, you can do something like this:

		cd pd:<cpm.goodstuff>
		get filename-1
		get filename-2
		...and so on

instead of using the longer filename forms shown in previous examples.

     Users of TOPS-10, TENEX, TOPS-20 or ITS systems can use "image" or
"paged" mode for ALL transfers.  UNIX users must use "ascii" mode for ASCII
files, and "tenex" or "type L 8" mode for binary files.  MULTICS users can
use "ascii" mode for ASCII files, but binary files require special treatment
that is best described by the following example provided by Paul Schauble
<Schauble@mit-multics.arpa>:

    !ftp simtel20
     220 SIMTEL20.ARPA FTP Server Process 5Z(14)-7 at Mon 10-Sep-84 00:27-MDT

     user_ftp:  !login anonymous
     331 ANONYMOUS user ok, send real ident as password.
     Password:  !guest

     user_ftp:  !quote "type l 8" <--(NOTE: That's lowercase "L" 8.)
     200 Type L bytesize 8 ok.

     user_ftp:  !get micro:<cpm.zcpr3>alias.hlp alias.hlp
     150 Retrieve of MICRO:<CPM.ZCPR3>ALIAS.HLP.1 started.
     226 Transfer completed.
     Total elapsed time:  35.7 seconds.
     4348 bytes transferred in 18.5 seconds (1850 bits/sec).

     user_ftp:  !quit
     221 QUIT command received. Goodbye.

Lines beginning with "!" are typed by the terminal user.  The received files
are stored on MULTICS with one 8-bit byte per 9-bit word, and can be trans-
ferred to a microcomputer with Kermit (described in a following paragraph).

     All aspects of the FTP process for UNIX machines have been automated to
a high degree by a program in directory PD:<UNIX.CPM>.  With this program,
a simple command like "mb modm700.com" can connect to SIMTEL20 and transfer
the binary file "modm700.com" from directory PD:<CPM.MODEM7> to a local file
also named "modm700.com", all with no user intervention.  Batch command files
containing multiple lines of the form in the above example can be run in
no-hangup background mode to transfer whole directories without the user even
remaining logged-in on his local system.  For more information, get the file
PD:<UNIX.CPM>AUTOFTP.DOC.



PROGRAMS FOR TRANSFERRING FILES AMONG MAINFRAMES AND MICROS

Christensen Protocol Mainframe Programs:

     For a micro to reliably exchange files with a mainframe, cooperating
file transfer programs with automatic error detection and retransmission of
faulty blocks must be running on both computers.  One such family of programs
uses a popular protocol created by Ward Christensen and enhanced by others.  
Directory PD:<UNIX.CPM> contains two programs, UC and the older UMODEM
(both written in C), which implement this protocol on UNIX machines.  See the
file PD:<UNIX>UNIX.CRCLST for a list of other useful UNIX utilities.

     On ITS machines, file transfer using the Christensen protocol can be done
using MMODEM (type :MMODEM for instructions), or LMODEM.  Documentation for
LMODEM is in file .INFO.;LMODEM HELP.  Other useful ITS utilities include:

	TYPE8  - types an ASCII file stored in ITS binary format.
	TYPESQ - types an ITS binary format "squeezed" file (see the first
	         paragraph under FILE TYPES).
	USQ    - creates an unsqueezed version of a squeezed file.
	HEXIFY - creates an Intel hex format file from an ITS binary format
	         COM file.
	COMIFY - creates a COM file from an Intel hex file.
	CRC    - computes the Cyclic Redundancy Check value for a file, using
	         the same algorithm that is used by the CP/M program CRCK.

Brief instructions for any of these utilities except LMODEM can be obtained by
typing ":utility_name" (for example, :CRC).

     The ITS utilities listed above are also available for use with TOPS-20,
but since ITS binary format is no longer being used for the SIMTEL20 archives,
these utilities have been converted to work with TOPS-20 binary formats.  A
collection of TOPS-20 utilities for transferring and manipulating files can be
found in directory PD:<CPM.TOPS-20>.  See PD:<CPM>CPM.CRCLST for a list of
available programs.

     File transfer and conversion utilities for use with VAX/VMS machines are
contained in directory PD:<CPM.VAXVMS>.  See CPM.CRCLST for details.


Christensen Protocol Microcomputer Programs:

     An excellent program for transferring files between micros, or between
micros and mainframes is called MODM7xx, where the "xx" is replaced with two
digits to give the current version number.  This program, often referred to as
MODEM7 (the name of its easier to pronounce ancestor), uses the popular
Christensen protocol to transfer files with automatic error detection and
retransmission of erroneous blocks.  

     To get started with MODM7xx, you should first FTP and examine the "DOC"
and "MSG" files from the binary library file PD:<CPM.MODEM7>MODM7xx.LBR.
The "DOC" and "MSG" files are actually stored in the library in squeezed
form, so you will have to perform three steps to get them:

	1. FTP the binary library file.
	2. Extract the elements having filename extensions of "DQC" and "MQG".
	   If you have no facilities for doing this on your mainframe host
	   (see the earlier comments on mainframe-based library utilities),
	   then you will have to transfer the library to a microcomputer and
	   extract the necessary elements there.  If this requirement seems to
	   put you in a "Catch-22" situation because you have no facilities
	   for mainfrome-to-microcomputer transfers, there is a way out; read
	   the "Getting Started" section which follows|.
	3. Use an "unsqueezer" (described above) to convert the "DQC" and
	   "MQG" files extracted from the library into "DOC" and "MSG" files.
	   As in the case of the library extractions, unsqueezing can be done
	   on either a mainfrome host or a microcomputer, depending on your
	   circumstances.

Together, these files will tell you just about all there is to know about
getting MODM7xx to run on your machine.  Take the time to read them; they're
quite informative.  You will also get some helpful insights from reading some
of the overlay files.  These overlays, described in file PD:<CPM.MODEM7>
M7OVL-yy.LST, are used to customize MODM7xx for particular machines without
having to edit and assemble the huge MODM7xx source file.  Complete
instructions for performing this procedure are contained in each overlay file.
The letters "yy" in the above filename should be replaced with two digits
giving the current version number as determined from CPM.CRCLST.

     And then, there is MEX.  MEX stands for "modem executive", and it is just
what the name implies, a communications and file-transfer program with a
built-in mini operating system that runs under CP/M.  This program can do file
transfers using either the Christensen or Compuserve protocol, and it has an
enormous potential for highly automated operations because it can read and
execute command-scripts pre-stored in disk files.  These scripts can include
sending commands to a remote computer, as if they had been sent manually from
the microcomputer in terminal-mode.  Users of this relatively new program are
still exploring its possibilities.  For more information, look in CPM.CRCLST
under the heading "PD:<CPM.MEX>", and then get the various files that have
"DQC" and "IQF" in their names.  These DOCumentation and INFormation files are
stored in squeezed form (note the "Q" in the filename extensions), so you will
have to unsqueeze them.  Overlays for MODM7xx will also work with MEX, but
they will not provide all of the extended MEX features.
 

Kermit:

     Another excellent program for transferring files is called KERMIT.  This
program has the advantage of being available for an impressively large number
of mainframes and micros.  It is, for example, available for the IBM-PC, and
it DOES NOT require CP/M.

     To get started with KERMIT, connect to CU20B.ARPA using FTP, and do this:

		get ker:aaaread.me

Note that this file is NOT on SIMTEL20, and the name is subject to change.
If you cannot find a file with this name, snoop around in the first half-
dozen or so files in the alphabetical listing obtainable using the FTP
DIRectory command.  You should find something useful.

     Questions can be addressed to INFO-KERMIT-REQUEST at CU20B.ARPA.


Getting Started:

     In order to get MODM7xx, MEX or KERMIT running on your micro, you must
first transfer the necessary files from mainframe to micro.  If you already
have a receive-to-disk communications program of some sort, you can use it to
move the needed files.  In the long-run it is essential to be able to transfer
8-bit binary files, but initially it is not absolutely necessary.  Some of
the files are quite large.  For example, MODM7xx.COM is over 18K bytes, and
the HEX file (which you will need if you can't transfer 8-bit files) is over
45K.  Moving large files to your micro without using an error detecting
protocol can result in frustrating errors, but it can be done by receiving
multiple copies and using manual or machine-assisted comparisons to locate and
repair bad parts of the code.  However, there IS a better way.

     Directory PD:<CPM.STARTER-KIT> contains a short starter-program that can
be FTPed to your mainframe, printed, and then entered into your microcomputer
by hand and assembled.  To examine this option, connect to SIMTEL20 via FTP
and do this:

		get pd:<cpm.starter-kit>pipmodem.asm 
		get pd:<cpm.starter-kit>pipmodem.doc 
		get pd:<cpm.starter-kit>mboot3.asm 

All are ASCII files.  Read PIPMODEM.DOC first, then look at MBOOT3.ASM.
PIPMODEM.DOC explains the situation very nicely.  Questions concerning these 
programs should be sent to INFO-CPM@AMSAA.ARPA (NOT to INFO-CPM-REQUEST).



NEWSGROUP CORRESPONDENCE ARCHIVES

     Copies of correspondence for several newsgroups are kept in directory
PS:<MAIL.ARCHIVES> on SIMTEL20.  At present, archives for the following
newsgroups are available:

		ADA-SW
		AMETHYST-USERS
		INFO-68K
		INFO-APPLE
		INFO-CPM
		INFO-FORTH
		INFO-HAMS
		INFO-MICRO
		INFO-MODEM7
		INFO-MODEMXX
		NORTHSTAR-USERS
		INFO-PASCAL
		UNIX-SW
		INFO-XENIX310

Descriptions of these and other newsgroups can be obtained via FTP with
anonymous login (as for SIMTEL20) from the Network Information Center's host
SRI-NIC.ARPA.  Ask for the file PS:<NETINFO>INTEREST-GROUPS.TXT (an ASCII
file).  And please note, this is NOT on SIMTEL20.

     File names for SIMTEL20 newsgroup correspondence archives have two
forms.  For example, PS:<MAIL.ARCHIVES>CPM.ARCHIV.ymmdd  is a group of files
containing INFO-CPM correspondence going back several years.  The characters
"ymmdd" in the file names are actually digits giving the year, month and day
of the last message in each particular file.  Current correspondence is kept
in the file PS:<MAIL.ARCHIVES>CPM-ARCHIV.TXT, which is constantly changing.
Although INFO-CPM has been used as an example here, the same naming scheme
is used for the other newsgroup files as well.  For a complete list of
available files, connect to SIMTEL20 via FTP and do this:

		dir ps:<mail.archives>

At present, all of these files are stored in ASCII.

I maintain my Christmas list with WordStar and use a short BASIC program to
print  out  labels.  A  minor  mod to the BASIC program would let it handle
phone numbers as you want. (The whole thing took  under  half  an  hour  to
write and debug).

I can't point to a specific program, but you might  try  _The  Whole  Earth
Software  Catalog_.  I'd expect them to have some information on stuff like
this.

I've implemented my budget planner with SuperCalc.  It's a trivial

Sounds like you've already got much of what  you  need.  There  are  budget
planners and mailing list programs out there if you insist (again, see _The
Whole Earth ..etc._), but it's unlikely any  will  be  _exactly_  what  you
want.  Most will take just as long to set up and customize as it would take
to implement them with SuperCalc or BASIC.

	Here is a question for the Kaypro people out there.
	
	I have a early Kaypro IV and would very much like to initialize
	the serial port.  Iam working on writing a terminal program for
	a special host.  The host needs to have the communications setup
	a special way.  From the documentation provided Iam not able to
	figure out how to communicate with the registers of the SIO.
	
	When I run my terminal program it does not send or receive any
	characters from the serial port.  My program sets the baud rate
	bye writing a hex 0E to port 0.  This should set me up for 9600.
	This is true if the system was reset.
	
	If I run one of my existing terminal programs, like SMODEM, and
	exit after it has initialized the serial port my program runs
	just fine.
	
	The system comes with a book that gives the port numbers and
	their functions as follows:
	
	Port#		Function
	0		Baud rate
	4		R/W port for characters
	6		Status/Control
	
	
	Is there something Iam missing in the documentation?
	Is there some example program I could look at?
	
	If it matters Iam programming in LMI Z80FORTH.
	
	Please reply to me at   (503) 627-6596  or (503) 645-0765
	
	Thanks Jed

I need to know the disk layout for an Ampro DSDD (single tracking)
386K formatted disk.  If anyone out there with the following info
could mail me same, I would be greatly appreciative.

I need to know -

	number of reserved tracks.
	size of allocation block (2K or 4K or 16K etc)
	number of directory entries
	if sector skew is needed (or if done during formatting)

A note went by regarding a file in the SIGM distribution that
purported to tell all about various 5.25" disk formats.  If
someone can identify a source of *that* for me, I'd also be
much appreciative.

Yes, I have C/NIX; I was given a copy to review and I played around
with it for a while on my Kaypro 2X.  If you are really stuck on the
*details* of Unix, don't bother.  You can see where the patches and
limitations of CP/M are encountered.  It lives on top of CP/M and
hooks into the BDOS like anything else; I believe it replaces the CCP.

It executes piping by creating temporary files which are redirected
into the next program (you didn't really expect it to fork a process,
did you?); but piping and redirection must be supported by the
programs you are using.  The programming language it is apparently
written in, and "supports" is C/80 (which is a good system).  You can
even "relocate" a program up to 200H if it is in C/80 rel format and
is assembled accordingly (I never did this so I am not sure whether I
got the description right).

The help function is quite similar to the man pages in unix, and is
satisfactory. 

The tree-structured directories use (what else) user areas; a
directory is simply a file with the names of the files in the other
user area in it; 'cd' changes you to the user area.  I am not sure if
you can have 16 or 32 subdirectories.  It would probably have been
nice on the kaypro 10 with the hard disk, but even with 400k on a
floppy I found it rather distracting.  I think tree-structured
directories are great when you have one big storage space, but when
things are broken up into 400k sections which you have to manipulate
by hand it is bothersome (but then, so are floppies).

To sum,  I think if you are a C programmer and are setting up a C
programming environment, and are using a plain-vanilla cpm system,
this would be an enhancement and probably useful to you (however, I
don't know whether datestamper programs, and their accompanying 'make'
programs will work with the system -- they might -- and I think 'make'
would be of more use).  If you use a lot of cpm programs it might be a
hassle.  Don't let the price scare you (you thought it was too low?);
when I got the review copy it was over $100, I believe, and I think
that was too much, but for 60$ it could provide a unix adherent with
some comfort (and you don't *have* to use treed directories).

Of course, the best system would be a 68020, 32032 or 80386 system
with 8Mb and a 40 Mb disk running GNU at under $5k.  Hopefully, in the
next five years.  In the meantime, I will be satisfied if I can get
gnuemacs on a micro.

	Does anyone out there know of any public domain compilers for any
of the popular languages that are available for the TRS-80 Model I or CoCo?
I know there is the old Dr. Dobbs C compiler, but does anyone have a converted
CP/M version working on their Model I or CoCo?  And what about the Xlisp
interpreter?  Does anyone have that working on their Model I or CoCo?  How
about any of the other popular languages like Prolog, Pascal, etc.?

	Any information related to such compilers or interpreters would

I recently inherited an early Osborne1. It lacks the DD option,
has no feature for supporting 80 Col., etc.  am looking for
pointers for sources for such upgrades, preferably as cheap as
possible... There are two other "non-standard" things I would like to
attempt with the box:
1) Hook up an external 8" floppy drive (possibly DS/DD)
2) Hook up my trusted H19 terminal to the RS232 port
I would appreciate any help with any of these things!
Merry Christmas!  Dan Krebill
P.S. Are there any on-line Osborne1 PD info/programs out there on the net?

Dan - Look in the SIMTEL20 archives.  There is a fair amt. of stuff specific
to the O1 and lots of generic cp/m stuff that could be used.

As an ex-O1 owner, I remember getting mailings from a company in Calif.
that offered upgrades to the 80 col. support, double, quad & hard drives,
big ram disks, etc., but the name of the company escapes me.  Anyone else
remember the company?

Best of Luck.

Checks & Balances from CDE software.

The problem isn't the availability of CP/M software.  I find that
there's plently of first rate stuff out there.  The problem is 
finding out what exists.  Some excellent sources:

FOGHORN:  The newsletter of the First Osborne Group, the best CP/M
specific publication in existence.  $24 a year for 12 issues plus
access to public domain bulletin boards.

PROFILES:  The slick mag from Kaypro corp.

KAYPRO SOFTWARE DIRECTORY nad ADDENDUM, massive paperbacks listing
hundreds of CP/M programs, with prices and publishers.  Any Kaypro
deal should be able to show you a copy.

CANADA REMOTE SYSTEMS:  a reputable mail order software dealer and
huge public domain bbs.

It doesn't matter which CP/M computer your using.  Almost every
program is available in versions for all major machines.  Only
problem is diskette compatibility, if you've got something weird.

Get Media Master to solve that problem.  A bargin at $39.95.

There are some truly great programs in CP/M.  I really like:

dBase II
FYI 3000 (textual database manager)
NewWord (for specific projects, such as script writing; WS is still better for most serious writing)
Tour:  a terrific public domain outline processor
The Word Plus:  an absolutely first-rate spelling checker

StarIndex:  a servicable indexer and table of contents generator
wsNote:  a perfect footnoting utility for WordStar or NewWord
FontStar:  a font program for dot matrix printers that's much easier
to use and less expensive than Fancy Font (although less versatile, 
as well).

If you need specific info, mail me and I'll try to dig it out
of my files.

Help!  I have a standard TRS-80 Model 4P running Montezuma Micro CP/M.
I have plenty of nice PD stuff and a little other stuff, but my main
trouble is that my only terminal program is a version of MDM730 that
is a lot of wasted space (I took a look at it with a sector editor) on
dialing stuff in Hayes mode, and not even CURSOR MOTION.  So for now I
have to use this thing in the TRSDOS mode...  Even if I HAD a hayes I
don't know how to activate the dialling, so my VenTel MD212+ has to be
used manually.  Help!
	I downloaded MEX114 and MEX112 libraries from a local RCP/M, but
my current problem is that they aren't overlayed right.  If anyone can
send me the MXO-RS13.ASM overlay for the Mod 4 with Montezuma Micro CP/M,
and MXO-VP10.ASM for my modem, I would be very grateful.

	      --------------------
		
It is probably possible to hook up your H19 by redesignating the
RS-232 port to CRT: with the SETUP program, but I haven't tried
it.  Because the OS-1 BIOS is in ROM, you have to fiddle it from
the system tracks if you want to make changes to facilitate
different devices, etc.

In my 3 1/2 years with two Ozzies, I have not heard of anyone
hooking up an eight-inch drive to one.  It might be possible via
the parallel port and/or the video port.

Best source of poop on Osbornes is the First Osborne Group (FOG)
in San Francisco.  I'll try to locate their exact addres and send
it to you.  There is still quite a lot of software and new
products available for the OS-1, especially from an outfit called
Spite Software, and lots of RAM drive and interface accessories
from West Wind.  I've dealt with both and had no problems.

There is PD software aplenty for the OS-1.  One of the most
complete is a terminal program called OTERM.  It provides MODEM
protocols, CIS protocols, ASCII transfer, etc, and is keyed to a
52-column Osborne.

Our machines have been workhorses for a long time now, and we
have had excellent luck with them.  Keep it cool and clean and
you should have no trouble.

Has anyone had any experience with either the INOVA 500 memory card from
Microtech Computer Services or the Multi-Function Board from Nuevo
Electronics Corp.?  Both are memory expansion boards for the Osborne
Executive computer.  I would like to expand the RAM memory in my
Executive (bank switched cpm 3) and have heard of both of these memory
expansion products through Spite Software but know nothing about either
of them.  Both claim to expand the memory (I assume through an internal
memory board changeout) to 512k of ram.  Both are roughly the same
price.

Thanks in advance,

Message-ID: <186@octopus.UUCP>
Date: 17 Dec 85 01:19:21 GMT
To:       info-cpm@AMSAA.ARPA

Thanks to all who responded to my request for help! Several had good clues
that led me to the correct answer.

Original problem: STAT shows two identically-named files in a directory.
	DIR and other directory commands don't. How did it happen? How to
	fix?

Suggestions:
	1. Don't trust STAT. (*WRONG* STAT was correct. DIR was wrong!)
	2. There may be invisible garbage characters in one filename.
		(*WRONG, In this case* but that can happen, I know...)
	3. Maybe STAT sees a 2-extent file as 2 files? (*WRONG*)
	4. A file is in the current user and in the public (user 0) area.
		(*WRONG* - That isn't a problem on Molecular, nor on any
			CP/M I know of, other than maybe OSM)
	5. There are 2 files. The CREATE call doesn't check for existing
		files first. (*RIGHT*... But see below!)

SUMMARY:

	It is up to the programmer to delete any existing file before using
	the CP/M CREATE call. CREATE always makes a new directory entry.

	HOWEVER, in MP/M, no previous delete is needed- the CREATE call returns
	an error if the file already exists!

	It appears that CB-80 assumes you will run programs under MP/M, so it
	doesn't bother with the delete. On the Molecular, you can run in either
	CP/M mode or MP/M mode.  In our case, it turned out that one user had
	the MP/M flag turned off, so they were the unknown source of duplicate
	filenames.

	NOTE that duplicate filenames are an unexpected thing in xP/M, and
	different programs treat them differently. For example:
		STAT - sees both files
		DIR  - sees one file
		D    - sees one file, adding size of both files to get 1 size
		PIP  - tacks one on to the end of the other (PIP will recombine
			the files automatically... maybe it collects all of
			the extents before moving anything?)
		OPEN call - usually gets the first directory entry in the
			system.

MORAL: Watch your CREATES and <C,M>P/M's!

XCAT502.LBR.1			BINARY	 81664  4053H

New Release     MCAT Version 5 Disk Cataloging Program
                XCAT Version 5 Catalog Cross-Reference Lister

   These two programs work as a team.  MCAT catalogs the directory of any
specified disk drive to a Master Catalog called MAST.CAT.  XCAT reads the
catalog and produces a cross-referenced listing of a selected set, or all
of the files to the console, printer or disk file.

   In addition to Filenames and Types, a disk ID is automatically appended
to each name in the catalog.  Optional fields can also be appended with
Version 5 to show the file's user area, and the created/modified date
provided by Plu*Perfect Systems' DateStamper(tm).  With Date features,
CP/M 2.2 is required.  If dates are not required, CP/M 3 should be useable.

   Major features provided in both MCAT and XCAT Version 5 are:

* Two-level operation; interactive screen-oriented mode, and one-shot "Expert"
  mode with parameters passed on the command line.
* Protection against corruption of MAST.CAT by conflicting operations
* Ability to pre-define default settings without reassembly, and to set new
  values interactively within the programs.
* Cursor and screen control definitions compatible with Plu*Perfect Systems'
  SETTERM utility for terminal installation.

   And some specific features:

MCAT - Create MAST.CAT in any drive/user area and enter "Ignore" names
     - Ambiguous as well as unambiguous "Ignore" names supported
     - Add a disk ID from within the program
     - Delete catalog entries for any specific disk by disk ID

XCAT - Search catalog and display only selected filenames, types or disks
     - Selectable destination for output filename, drive and user list
     - Display dates in US (mm/dd/yy) or European (dd.mm.yy) format

What is your favorite EMACS-like editing environment under CP/M-80 ?
Is this a product or a personal hack ?  If a product, whose is it and
where did you get it ?  How does it compare to EMACS on 'the big machine'
at work ?

This should be interesting !  If you post it directly to me, I'll digest
it for the list.  Thanks !

If you know anything about programming you might want to consider the 
public domain version of MUMPS.  It's called MicroMUMPS and is 
available from: 

     Dr. Richard Walters
     Dept. Elec. Comp. Engineering
     University of California
     Davis, CA 95616

I use it on my Kaypro II, and find it works well.  I believe the cost 
is on the order of $60.00.

MUMPS is a string-oriented ANSI-standard language which is designed to 
facilitate building and manipulating databases, and handles sorts very 
nicely from the programmers perspective.

To sort on a field all you have to do is use the SET command to create
an array (either in memory or on disk) using the desired field as a
subscript, and MUMPS sorts it for you automatically.  For example,
let's say I have a MUMPS array: 

  ^PEOPLE(NUMBER)=NAME;STREET;CITY;STATE;ZIP

where NUMBER is an internal counter, and the data nodes (NAME, etc.) 
are my fields.  To sort on ZIP would involve looping through 
^PEOPLE(NUMBER), setting a variable ZIP to the 5th Piece of the node, 
and SETing the following scratch array :

  ^TEMP(ZIP,NUMBER)=""

Then all I would need to do is loop through ^TEMP(ZIP,NUMBER), and 
retrieve my data nodes from ^PEOPLE(NUMBER), and do whatever I wanted 
with the records (write them out to a file, generate form letters, 
whatever...).

If you have a hard disk on your Z80 system, there is a public 
domain database management system called Fileman (developed and used 
heavily at the Veterans Administration) which is also available from 
Dr. Walters which can do all this for you, without your needing to 
know anything about MUMPS code.

The complete PC/BLUE distribution is now available on SIMTEL20 from
Volumes 000 through 124 in PD:<PC-BLUE.VOLnnn>.  (Note the PD:
designation as the current alias for the MICRO: structure.)

Some notes:

1.  Volumes 001 through 042 were reissued on double-sided disks, two
volumes per disk.  We made no attempt to split the files on those
disks into their respective volumes as originally issued.  Thus, for
the volumes in this range, the files for the even-numbered volumes
will be found in the directory containing the next-lower numbered
volume.  There are a few exceptions.  It would be best to get a copy
of PD:<PC-BLUE>PC-BLUE.CRCLST to check.

2.  These volumes were uploaded from copies of the distribution disks
using a real IBM-PC using MEX-PC, except for two, which were uploaded
later.  In all cases, the MODEM protocol was used.  This means that
because PCDOS stores files in exact length and the MODEM protocol
sends fixed blocks of 128, those files which were not exact multiples
of 128 could not be checked with CRCK to verify the values against the
published values in the -CATALOG files.  Thus, we are going to assume,
unless otherwise informed, that the copies were correctly uploaded
from the disks we received, and further assume that the disks we
received were correct copies of the master disks from which the
published CRCs were computed.  This is further compounded by the fact
that we uploaded all the files in binary format and then post-processed
the files to convert to ASCII those which follow certain rules.  Thus,
the resulting CRCs we publish in PD:<PC-BLUE>PC-BLUE.CRCLST assume
files are multiples of 128 and ASCII files are padded with ^Zs to the
next 128-byte boundary.

3.  We used the MODEM protocol instead of KERMIT so that you may use
either protocol to download these files and use our published CRC
values to verify that you got a correct copy of what we have stored
here.  Had we used KERMIT, those of you using MODEM would not have any
basis to check on the file transfers.

4.  Given the recent appearance of so-called Trojan Horse programs, we
make no guarantees that these programs will work as documented and
only as documented, and furthermore assume no liability should these
programs fail to work or cause damage, incidental or otherwise.  We
merely present this collection as-is for those of you with Internet
FTP access to SIMTEL20 for your convenience.

5.  For those users at sites without Internet access, have your site
manager contact me to make arrangements for one-time, as-is, tape
copies of our collections made at our convenience on tapes you supply
with return postage.  There is no fee and our turnaround is slow.  We
can only write TOPS-20 DUMPER, TOPS-10 Interchange, and Unix tar
format tapes, 9-TRK, 1600 bpi.

[when in doubt, pip it!]

	When CP/M boots, it considers the drive that it booted from A:
and starts with with the A> prompt.  Can I corece it into believing
it booted from B:, and how?
	One may ask "why", and I haven't a complete answer.  I am
puzzling over how to handle a system with a SSDD and a DSDD drive.
Normally I boot from the SSDD, but if that boot is bad, I would want to
boot from the DSDD.  Unfortunately, the boot ROM looks only for device 0
so I have to change the drive addresses and will probably confuse
CP/M (watta you mean drive 0 is single sided? It was double sided when
I booted!).

	My solution for now is to logically define the double sided drive
as B: double sided and D: single sided.  This way, I can copy
A: (the single sided drive) to D: and use the disk in drive A:.
I just have to keep enough backups of the single sided system disk
to keep out of trouble.

	Thanks in advance.

[BDOS err on a: bad sector]

	I see that message way too often.  I am using NASHUA diskettes
purchased bulk from JDR, so the medium should be fine.
They start off error free, but then disaster strikes.
(well, I'm using ED until I get WS.  Could ED be bombing the disk?)
I think the sector CRC may be off.  Is there a program for CP/M
similar to FSDB that allows you to read a bad sector, edit it and
write it back with a new CRC?

	Should be fine is the correct phrase.  I added a DSDD drive,
and several diskettes have failed verification.  It is always
tracks >32 on side 1 (as opposed to side 0 which is used by SSDD drives).
I doubt it is the disk drive since it is only in the inner tracks
on one side (seek errors would be both sides, a bad head would be
all tracks.  Maybe the wire to the head?).
Cable problems would be intermittent.
I doubt it is the driver since it is side dependent.
Could it be the medium?  If anything I'd suspect the 0 side since
the bottom side seems to have a larger unpolished hub than side 1
(the upper side).  Any ideas?

	Thanks in advance.

I run with two 8 inch floppies (QUME 842s) and a Compupro DISK-1
controller.  I have been having trouble booting my MP/M 8-16 system.
What happens is that the MPM loader needs to read a file from the
data area on the floppy, and when it does so I get a BDOS Bad Sector
error. 

The possible reasons are 

1. bad drive
2. bad disk
3. bad controller

It isn't the drive: I get the error when I interchange the drives so
that the old A is the new B and vice versa -- the new A gives the same
error.  

It isn't the disk: I tried it with several disks, and it happened with
each. 

That leaves the controller.  Anyone care to comment on whether or not
a controller would do flaky things to reads and writes from just one
or two tracks on a floppy?

thanks.

Herb,

A friend having the same configuration (Compupro, Controller 1, etc.)
had the same problem.  We finally solved it using a head cleaner.  

Moral: Try the simple things first.  Check the power supply, the
cabling, and the heads.  And the baud rate.

   Is there any way I can get around the "disk space already in use" message
when trying to put 60k CP/M on a 56k CP/M disk (apple II+)?  I was installing
ZCPR2 on a floppy but the file was not working correctly and now I am stuck
with 56k CP/M -- not much use since my hard drive works only under 60k.  I
have CP/M on the HD already but would like to have it available on the floppies
as well.  Whenever I try to put 60k on the 56k disk, I get the message and
am returned to CP/M.  Any suggestions?

This is my second posting of this. Somehow I don't think it got out as I
never saw it on any of the requested newsgroups except for one local
newsgroup (it's been 3 days). If it did, please excuse the reposting.

I need some help in trying to figure out a way to get my KayproII to
autostart a file from a cold boot. 
It seems to me that CP/M had some way to do this with
AUTO.COM or something, but I don't see it in any of the documentation.
I am working towards a "turnkey" system. I am running CP/M 2.2.
I am familiar with how Northstar did it on their boxes running
2.2, but it seems this is different for Kaypro. Any advice/pointers would
be greatly appreciated.
										Thanks in advance,

I don't own a Kaypro, so have never tested the program, but I have a
program called AUTOBOOT on my RCP/M that has different versions for
different KP CP/M's. It is under 20k, so can be downloaded quie easily.
If you can't call, mail me directly and we can work out some
sort of "disk-swap" via US-Mail.

Steve, DEARC.PQS is for MSDOS, not CP/M.  It must be changed slightly
and that has been done.  DEARC for CP/M is available from SIMTEL20 as:

Filename			Type	 Bytes	 CRC

Directory PD:<CPM.TURBOPAS>
DEARC-CP.LBR.1			BINARY	 28032  C01AH

I can't get it to run on my system because I don't have enough TPA
space.  Please give it a try, though.  My TPA is smaller than most
people's because of an EPROM at E000h.

There exists a version of ARC in Turbo Pascal.  I don't remember the
exact name but it is something obvious like ARC.PAS.  It is available on
many BBS systems that have Turbo Pascal interest groups.
I am pretty sure that there is a copy available on the Santa Fe BBS
(505) 988-5867.  This machine  is available from 4pm to 6am MST and on
weekends.

The easiest way for you to do this is to get Plu*perfect's enhanced
operating system for the Kaypro.  Look in a Profiles for the address;
they are in idyllwild CA.  Their system has an autoboot configuration
in the CPMCONFIG program.  They also have a lot of other nice things;
sort of a commercial ZCPR.

You could also do it by hacking around with the operating system;
apparently there is some space on the system tracks where, if you
insert a command line, it will autoboot that line.  I remember reading
about it, but I already had pluperfect so I didn't pay much attention.
It might be in a back issue of micro C (before they went MSDOS; well,
only one issue has come out since that happened, but I am still a bit
shocked at David Thompson -- last summer at SOG, he said he would
support CP/M tp the grave.  I didn't realize he meant *it's* grave).

Subject: Resident screen copier wanted
In-reply-to: Msg of 23 Dec 1985  13:32-MST from Ted Shapin <BEC.SHAPIN at USC-ECL.ARPA>

    I am looking for a program that will stay resident and copy
    everything that other programs send to the console to a disk
    file.

Just such a program was recently uploaded to SIMTEL20:

Filename			Type	 Bytes	 CRC

Directory PD:<CPM.SYSUTL>
PHOTO.LBR.1			BINARY	  6016  473BH

PHOTO.COM makes a copy (takes a picture) of all screen displays and
keyboard entries; and write these characters to a disk file.  This
is useful for getting all of the screen prompts from a given program
that does not have a companion .DOC file that will tell you what to
expect.  To use PHOTO.COM for I/O capture, use the command line:

A>PHOTO D:filename.typ D:program <PARAMETERS>

     Where:
     D: is the disk drive
     D:filename.typ  -- is the file to be created by PHOTO.COM
     D:program is the program (PROGRAM.COM) whose screen prompts
	 you want to copy
     <PARAMETERS> are the normal parameters you would enter after
	 the program name (WS B:filename)

Photo will continue to write all screen displays and keyboard entries to
FILENAME.TYP until <CTRL>C is entered from the keyboard.

                    EXCEPTIONS

Unfortunately, if PROGRAM.COM contains certain hard device calls or
screen controls these program elements may either defeat PHOTO.COM, or
enter characters in FILENAME.TYP that will prevent the file from being
edited by programs like WordStar.

For Example, you want a file copy of the log on-messages in WordStar.
The proper command line is:

     A>PHOTO D:WORDSTAR.MSG D:WS <RETURN>

WORDSTAR.MSG will contain all of the WordStar signon messages, however,
it will also contain screen control characters that will prevent WordStar
from editing the file.  If the file does not show you the expected text
when you open it under WordStar, exit WordStar and try viewing it with:

     A>TYPE filename.ext

If TYPE displays the text as you expect to see it, you must edit out the
screen control characters with DDT, SID, DUU or some other ASCII file
editor.

If you are unable to access SIMTEL-20 because of network restrictions
please remember that MOST of the new files announced to Info-Cpm are
also available on my RCP/M Royal Oak (MI) which may be accessed at
300 bps (Bell 103a), 1200 bps (Bell 212a), or 2400 bps (V.22 bis).
The telephone number is (313) 759-6569.  They are also available from
the CPM RoundTable on General Electric Information Services' GEnie.

Depends on your computer.  On the Osborne 1, hitting " (i.e, shift-
double quote) will boot from B.  On the Osborne Executive and Vixen,
hitting Tab instead of <cr> will boot from B.  don't know about other
brands.

It sounds like you may have a problem with dirty heads and/or head
alignment.  The higher numbered tracks are towards the hub, thus
the information is packed more tightly there.

Re: disk editors, check most any RCP/M for Ward Christensen's DU
program (or its later derivatives).  It will allow you to read/edit
/rewrite any sector on the disk, and I have used it on Os1, Kaypro, and
the pseudo-disks that the Mimix package creates for CP/M on my Fortune
32:16 (UN*X derivative), all without any modification whatsoever.
There are commercial editing programs avail (Disk Doctor, Inspect, and
who knows what else), that may be easier to use than Wards, but they
aren't any better (my opinion).

The copy program that comes with the KAYPRO has the ability of
setting up the autostart line when you are copying or formatting a
disk.

Could be that CP/M is still using the directory and disk parameters from
a disk previously in the same drive, for which the current disk access
would have been erroneous.  The solution is to warm boot (control C)
after every disk change.  If you are running purchased software which
requires disk changes but doesn't reread the directory after you do so,
the software is buggy.

Sorry if this seems like trivial help, but you didn't say what causes
you had already ruled out before suspecting your diskettes.

Subject: re: auto loading a kaypro
To: info-cpm@AMSAA.ARPA


a method for auto loading of cp/m i have used on several different systems
is this:

        o       fist you need to copy a bootable work disk, and be sure
                you have ddt/edfile/patch or some tool you are comfortable
                with,for use in patching your system image.if you don't
                have a favorite,the PATCH utility is one i can't live without
                and i recomend it.

        o       you will also need a copy of your 'system' (ie save a copy
                with "sysgen" or "movcpm" to the disk). again if you use
                patch,you can also just patch the system tracks.

        o       using the debug/patching tool of your choice,open up your
                system image and look for the begining of your CCP.(i am asuming
                that you are *NOT* running zcpr/zcpr2/zcpr3. if you are,ignore
                the rest of this note,and read the documentation on the zcpr?
                you are running.)the big clue here is it should be around 0A00H
                and you normaly will find the DIGITAL RESEARCH copyright notice
                close by.

        o       your CCP should begin with 2 jumps. the first is the normal
                entry for the ccp,the second is an entry to bypass the auto
                load 'feature' you are trying to turn on.(these will be
                C3 xx xx C3 xx xx)

        o       when you find this seq. it is decoded as:

                C3 xx xx C3 xx xx nn ## ** ** ** ** ** ** and so on...
                \______/ \______/ /\ /\ /\
                 normal   alt.    || || ||  the command starts here and goes
                 ccp      ccp     || || |+- for a maximum of nn characters.
                 entry    entry   || ||
                                  || |+- this is a single byte containing the
                                  ||     length of your command string.
                                  ||
                                  |+- this is a singel byte containing the max.
                                      space in the command buffer.(normaly '7F')


        o       after you have patched your immage,don't forget to save it. you
                then run sysgen/movcpm in the normal way to copy this new system
                to your system tracks and then boot it.


that's about it. if you have any questions or problems let me know and i will
try to help. i have never used this on a kaypro,but i think it is generic
CP/M.


i disclaim all disclaimers and further more state that the above info would have
been impossible for me to provide with out an open copy of "PROGRAMMERS GUIDE TO
CP/M" eidted by SOL LIBES (hope there are not toooo many typos)

Also, along with the FORMAT system, there are programs available that
will do the trick. Or you could dig down into the first few sectors on
the disk and find the 20H characters that signify such a spot.

Does anyone know where I might be able to buy CP/M for a Z-80 system
using the Cromemco 16FDC disk controller.  Up to this point I have been
using Cromemco's CDOS (CP/M look-alike, sorta), but I have finally started
having some compatibility problems.

I use CP/M-80 on a variety of machines, but mostly on my Apple //e at
home (I also have CP/M for my C64).  Anyway, PCPI, ALS, and Commodore
were not nice enough to provide a SYSGEN or MOVCPM program with their
products.  Short of hacking upon the disk itself with a sector editor,
are their any substitute utilities I could use ?  Suggestions anyone ?

Many thanks.

I would greatly appreciate it if anyone with exposure to the MIX C compiler

Thank you kindly.  Happy holidays!

To: info-cpm@AMSAA.ARPA

I have this product (Write-Hand-Man) that has recently been converted to run on
CP/M 3.0 (primarily for the C-128 market).  I find that it fails to work on the
Executive.  Since I had trouble with the Vixen (another osborne creation tha 
was a non-standard CP/M 2 machine) I suspect the Executive is not a "simple" 
CP/M 3.0 machine.  Can someone answer a few questions.

What is the size of the Common Bank.

What are the System Addresses (in both banks, BDOS and BIOS addresses, SCB 
address and the like)

What are the first few instructions of the BDOS (in both banks)

Is the BIOS jump vector "complete" allowing SELBNK calls from RSX's that happen
to be in the common bank (see question 1).

WHM is an RSX that Reenters the BDOS and thus must reach inside and save Stacks
 and state variables in both banks before it reenters the BDOS.  I had hoped 
that since CP/M 3.0 was even less alive than CP/M 2.2 (have you ever tried to 
get an unconfigured CP/M 3.0 system with all the manuals and source?) there 
would be few "custom versions".  Leave it to osborne.

Thanks for any help

   I am looking for a word processor that I can use under CP/M on an Apple II+.
WordStar updates the screen at an annoyingly dead slow pace.  The fact that my
eighty-column card does not support line insert/delete does not help, but I do
know that it can run a little faster than WordStar wants to.  Any information
other word processing software would be appreciated.  Hardware setup includes

Apple II+
10MB (sider) hard disk
MicroSoft CP/M (60k 2.23)
Videx-compatible eighty-column card (Viewmax-80)
Diablo 630 printer on an Apple Serial Interface (NOT the SSC, but I do have
   a SSC that I can use if the word processor will not work with Apple's
   interface)

Subject: Help needed with 8251 USART

Does anyone out there have any experiece programming the 8251 USART?  I
am using a Royal Alphatronic PC with CP/M 2.2, and want to be able to
set and change the baud rate.  I have the data sheets for the 8251, and 
through much experimentation, I am able to change the baudrate to suit
my needs.  Unfortunatly, as soon as I try to send data out the port,
the chip locks up.  Data coming in works fine.  Anyone know anything
about this?  I can send you the code that I am using if you think
that you can help me out...

The CCS S-100 bus system CPU includes a small program in it's ROM for an 
auto baud rate detection for console baud rate. When you boot, you hit the
return key 3 times and you're in A> prompt. I could try to get a copy of this
to you, to use as a source for developeing a driver for whatever comm program
you're using. Yes, please send code to the below address, I'll take a look at 
it.

I read a review of a checkbook program for CPM-80 called
"The Smart Checkbook" from Softquest Inc., Vienna, VA (703) 281-1621. 
Features included printing the checks and addressing envelopes (I think)
as well as very flexible budget/account categories allowing checks
to be split across several categories; and it was supposed to be
fast.

The biggest drawback was the price ($139), but I seriously thought
about buying it until my VT-180 (DEC "robin") died. Now I'm thinking
of an Amiga as a better way to spend the repair money.

Thanks for your quick reply.  First of all, let me give you a little 
background about this computer(Royal Alphatronic PC).  According to Royal,
the only way to change the baud rate is by a hardwired jumper on the 
main PCB.  But, like I said, I've been able to change it as long as I
don't try to send data out. When I send something out, everything locks
up and I must do a cold boot.  This mystifies me, because everything that
I am doing seems to make sense.  Here's my setbaud.asm:


MCNTR	EQU	41H		;Modem control port
RESET	EQU	01000000B	;Value for port reset
MINIT1	EQU	01111010B	;Value for 1 stop bit, even parity,
                                ; 7 data bits, 16X baud rate
MINIT2	EQU	00010101B	;Value for Error reset, transmit 
                                ;enable, receive enable

	ORG	100H

INITIALISE:	MVI	A,RESET 	;Puts 8251 in instruction mode
		OUT	MCNTR		;
		MVI	A,MINIT1	;sets up baud, etc.
		OUT	MCNTR		;
		MVI	A,MINIT2	;Puts 8251 back in normal mode
		OUT	MCNTR
		JMP	0

This is pretty self explanatory, I guess... and it SHOULD work, but
there must be something that I'm missing... 

Let me know what you can come up with.

                                   Thanks again,
                                   Mike

[ I don't think the mailer will hack your return address, so here it
  goes to the list at large ]

First of all I think you want 8 data bits not 7, and the usual 1
stop bit, 16X baud clock.  Second, to RE-init the 8251 you first have
to send a command to it to turn it off, THEN the reset, init, and
enable sequence.  For 8 data, 1 stop, 16X here are the values in HEX.
0AAh 040h 0CEh 017h.  Also you *CAN* change the baud rate (within
limits) by changing the 1X, 16X, 64X clock devider rate.  i.e.
if you set the hardware switch to 1200 baud then by changing the
16X to 64X you would get 300 baud!  Hope this helps.

There was a recent request for memory-map type information on the
Osborne Executive.  I have not had time to get all the information
requested, but I will provide some of it now and some later, as time
permits.

Bank 0:  The lower part contains system space and the upper part
contains most of bios and bdos.  The top part (4k, I think) is common to
all banks and is the normal way that the banks talk to each other.

Bank 1:  This is the normal user-accessable bank, it contains the cpm 3
base page, the TPA, and the common area in the highest addresses.

0-0ffh:  cpm 3 base page

100h-0f305h:  TPA

0f306h-0f8ffh:  p/o bios,bdos

The address of the warm start bios entry point in the jmp at 0000.

The address of the bdos entry point in the jmp at location 0005.

Banks 2-6:  Empty at present

Bank 7:  Contains video memory

Bank 8:  Start-up ROM, function key definitions,etc
                    in the lowest part of memory.

It's been a while, but I recall that the 8251 had a problem with reset. 
The solutions I've seen are 1: send reset several (3?) times, 2: go through 
the reset-program sequence twice.  Don't know exactly what the problem with 
the 8251 is but that seems to fix it. 
AH, I found some code from my HAL MCEM-8080 (ca 1976).


	UARTI	EQU	8EH	;INITIAL UART MODE WORD
	URTMO	EQU	0EAH	;7 BITS, EVEN PARITY, 2 STOP
	URTCT	EQU	0BH	;UART CONTROL PORT
	URTDA	EQU	0AH	;UART DATA PORT
	UARTR	EQU	55H	;RESET COMMAND
	TXRXE	EQU	27H	;UART RX AND TX ENABLE 


INIT:	MVI	A,UARTI		;UART MODE OUT	
	OUT	URTCT 
	MVI	A,UARTR		;RESET 
	OUT	URTCT 
	MVI	A,URTMO		;FINAL UART MODE
	OUT 	URTCT
	MVI	A,TXRXE		;ENABLE UART
	OUT	URTCT
	RET


The above code works.  I have seen a slightly different way, but can't
lay my hands on it this morning.

I remember now that the 8251 comes on with its brains slightly scrambled.
There are two control bytes that are sent to the same address sequentially
and it doesn't know where it is in that sequence when first initialized.

Hope this is some help.

Does anyone know of a program for CP/M which would allow the system
to be used as a VT100 terminal (i.e. translat incoming ANSI codes to
whatever terminal is hooked to the CP/M system). TERM II comes close
but only allows one-for-one mapping. I'm using an ADM31 type of terminal.
Thanks.

There is a PD program GATE.LBR for generalized async terminal emulator
which I have downloaded from somewhere (since I am replying, I don't know
whether it is on simtel20 - I will upload it if it isn't).  I haven't
tried it yet so what info I have is from a quick look at the documentation.

I have uploaded to SIMTEL20 a set of LBR utils using Z3 format, I
don't have any sources.  This may answer a question I saw on
INFO-CPM...

Filename			Type	 Bytes	 CRC

Directory PD:<CPM.ZCPR3>
LUZ3.LBR.1			BINARY	 20608  3A2DH

This LBR contains the following Library Utilities for ZCPR3:

LGET.COM extracts files from within library files with optional unsqueeze.

LHELP.COM processes HLP/HQP files from within library files

LLF.COM lists files within library files

LX.COM executes COM files within library files

These tools assist the ZCPR3 user in dealing with libraries in the
ZCPR3 environment.  Following the ZCPR3 philosophy of how commands
should be constructed, these are full ZCPR3 tools which take advantage
of the ZCPR3 environment and can only run in the ZCPR3 environment.
These tools are written in Z80 code and will only run on Z80 or
HD64180 microprocessors.  Online documentation for each tool is
available by typing the name of the tool followed by two slashes:

          TOOL //
