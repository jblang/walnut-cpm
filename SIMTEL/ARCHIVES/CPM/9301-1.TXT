Subject: Osborne1 disk translation help
Message-ID: <1465.544.uupcb@ehbbs.gwinnett.com>

I'm trying to get some advice on how to translate some old SSSD
5.25" Osborne1 CPM disks to MS-DOS readable ones.

Does anyone know of an Osborne User Group or BBS?

There do exist some CPM conversion utilities (ala 22DISK) which
will run on a PC, but these will *not* convert the older (early
model Osborne1) SS floppies without some kind of surgery to the
PC floppy controller to allow it do deal with a single-sided disk.

We have an ancient copy of Crosstalk that actually runs on the
Osborne, but we can't get it to drive an external modem.  The
machine with this software did drive the modem a decade ago, but
we've completely forgotten how it was set up.  Maybe a bad serial port?

The disks to be converted are old WordStar document files which
have both personal and professional value.  The floppy drives on
this machine sound like they're grinding rocks, and it can't last
forever.

I'd appreciate any help or suggestions.  Thanks muchly.

Subject: Power requirements?
Message-ID: <C08oHC.E1z@uceng.uc.edu>

Hi,
	I recently acquired a six-slot S-100 card cage, sans power supply.
It has connections for +8, Gnd, +16, and -16. Since each card has it's own
regulator, I was wondering how strict these voltages need to be. For
example, can I use +18, -18 and +7.6 volts?

	What kind of current am I expected to provide?

	Thanks,
		Steven

Subject: What is the legal status of CP/M?
Message-ID: <1993Jan4.053012.23019@coe.montana.edu>

For those of you who have been long-term CP/Mer's, a few
questions about CP/M:

Is CP/M in the public domain now?  Does DRI still own it?  If
not, is anyone still actively developing it (CP/M) or still
developing applications for it?

My reason for asking is this: I'm working on some software 
(a subset Fortran-90 compiler) that will run using a
pcode-interpreter program.  I'm wondering if it'd make sense for
me to eventually port a version of it to CP/M.

Just curious... The first micro I ever used was an Apple-2, c.
1979.  We'd look at that machine (w/ 48K of RAM) and think,
"Gee, who could ever *really* use that much memory!!!" :-)

Often I get the sense that despite all the hardware advances of
the last 15 years (many), and despite the software advances
(few), the things ordinary people really *use* and *need*
computers for, really haven't changed all that much.  I read &
hear regularly how GUI's make people more 'productive' (whatever
*that* means), and trade rags commonly try to sell me the idea
that I need a 15 ziloMIP box on my desk with enough RAM on board
to sink the Titanic...

Is there still a market for CP/M machines and software?  Has MS-DOS
(+MS Windows, +IBM OS/2, + ??) made CP/M obsolete? Or just raised
everyone's expectations so much that CP/M couldn't compete? 

(You know, the line that you'll just DIE if you don't get
256-color VGA with razzle-dazzle mouse-button thingumbobs with
your checkbook balancing program...)

Ciao --

Lou.

Subject: Wither S-100 HD controllers?
Message-ID: <C0BD3A.8DL@uceng.uc.edu>

Hi All...

	Tonight I finally rolled up my sleaves and looked through
the 8" disks I got with my CCS S-100 CP/M system. I found copies
of BIOS code that the previous owner had modified to fix some bugs
in the CCS BIOS. Anyway, I was thinking ... Gee, it sure would be
nice to have a hard drive with my system (especially since I am
thinking about getting ZCPR running).

	Does anyone know where I can get a hard drive controller
for the S-100 bus? Do they take some kind of industry standard
HD? (I heard MFM...).

	On a side note, has anyone configured ZCPR with a CCS
floppy card and CPU? I think there are some BIOS mods needed,
and would sure appreciate someones experience.

	Also, I have a couple of H-19 terminals that are taking
up space. How much could I expect to get for these (they both work
great).

	Thanks for your patience. Some of you "old time" CP/M-ers
are probably chuckling, remembering back when you first modified your
BIOS. It's funny - at work we work on state-of-the art DSP processors
on the latest DEC Vaxes--- yet there is some simple attraction to
the S-100 bus and CP/M. Probably has to do with the fact that I
am impressed what can be done in less than 64K...

	Any conversation would be helpful...
		Steven

Yes. MicroSolutions has (or at least used to have) a Kaypro version. I've got

If the Osborne is still alive you can format double densitiy discs, too
and copy the single densitiy discs to the double density discs.
Osborne DD discs can be read by a PC (e.g. with ZSIM20).

I stopped using this computer about 4 years ago & haven't turned it on
since, so not sure if it works.  I almost threw it in the trash when I
moved to Ohio, but decided there may still be someone out there who

I've three different controller types, each with different board layout.

I'd need to know the purpose of different jumpersetting on these controllers,

Subject: diseased Kaypro/Wordstar
Message-ID: <1if6sfINNeou@CS.UTK.EDU>

I have a Kaypro 4'84, and I'm using Wordstar 4.0, and I have a problem
somewhere.  I keep looking part of 'large-files'.  What's happening is that
parts of files are disappearing only to be replaced with other (duplicate)
parts of the same file.

The first times it happened, I was working on a large file on a full disk,
and I just assumed that when I had tried to save, and there wasn't room, that
Wordstar got lost when it stopped to tell me there wasn't any room and I had 
to delete stuff to continue.  The latest time it happened, I was working on
a much smaller file on a virtually empty disk.  (and to make it worse,
I was dutifully saving every so often, so there was no backup file to
get the data from.  I lost about 2-3 hours of work.)

My husband thinks it's a disk drive problem.  I'm not so sure.  I don't 
seem to have the problem with pip, for instance.  Any suggestions?  Ideas?
I do re-build Wordstar ever so often.  I use it all the time, and the disk
"goes bad" every so often.

All help appreciated.

Thanks
Susan

The answer to your read MS-DOS problem depends on the kind of drives you
have in your Kaypro II.  If you have double-sided double density drives,
you should be able to use some of the public domain or commercial software
that is available.  If you have single-sided drives, you may be out of
luck.  I use Compat in my 4/84 with no problems.

Mediagenic has re-released a package of 20 Infocom games, under the package
name of "The Lost Treasures of Infocom".  It is available at most computer
stores for about $50-$60.  I got mine at Electronics Boutique over a year
ago for $53.99.  At that time, only the IBM-PC version was available.  I assume
that the Mac version is now available.  There was a duplication problem in 
one of the 3.5 in. diskettes, long since fixed.

The props/documentation are all presented in a bound softcover book (except for
the complete maps of the games), as well as a hint book.  There is a (rather
kludgey, IMHO) installation front end that was added on (by virtual
"volunteers", from what I heard about the time and money they were given ;-).

While the props and original boxes are not there (and thus taking a bit out of
the self-imposed "fun"), the games are all there and intact.  It was great to
travel down memory lane.

From an old post by Chuck Greenwald, Sept '91:

-----------------------------------------------------------------
...

The twenty games are:

MYSTERY             SCIENCE FICTION
  Deadline            Starcross
  Witness             Suspended
  Suspect             Planetfall
  Ballyhoo            Stationfall
  Moonmist            Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy

ZORK                MYSTICAL
  Zork Zero           Enchanter
  Zork I              Sorcerer
  Zork II             Spellbreaker
  Zork III
  Beyond Zork           HORROR

ADVENTURE             Lurking Horror
  Infidel

This is all of the Infocom games through 1986, except Cutthroats, Seastalker,
Fooblitzky, AMFV, Wishbringer, Hollywood Hijinx, Trinity, and Leather
Goddessses.
It also includes one each from 1987 and '88.  There are still some copies of
Leather Goddesses in stores.  I guess the other 8 were not very popular.

  ... and Hollywood Hijinx is one of my favorites!

Subject: Morrow MD-11 woes
Message-ID: <1igcnbINNpi8@titan.ucc.umass.edu>

Hi old-time CP/M'ers!  I try to rarely spend time on Usenet (too much
else to do, and Usenet can be too addictive), but it's nice to see a
CP/M group here!

Anyway, I used to use a Morrow MD-11 (at the time of purchase, circa
1984, it was far more powerful than just about anything else out
there); I haven't used or needed it for some years, but I've recently
wanted to pull some old files off of it (most of them in LBR format).
Trouble is, the old thing just won't boot.  I get a "Data Not Found"
error regardless of whether I try to boot off the hard disk or an
original distribution floppy.

Unfortunately, I put all the manuals I had out in the recycling bin
some months ago, so I can't just look up the answer to my dilemma.

In any case, does anyone have any suggestions?  Does anyone know which
jumpers to change to conduct diagnostics on this lovely dinosaur?  Or,
if the problem is the disk controller (which seems likely), does
anyone have any suggestions whatsoever as to how it might possibly be
fixed?

I'll try to check this newsgroup, but private responses would be
especially appreciated.

Thanks in advance, and cheers to those keeping the CP/M flame,

Michael

There is a commercial package called Uniform -- been around for years,
should still be in business. If you can't find it, ask and I'll look
up the manual. Be sure that you don't pick up a second-hand copy for a
different Kaypro, e.g., K10, as there are different versions of
Uniform for them.

Hmn. It's been *many* moons since I used WS4 on a CP/M Kaypro. But I
*did* use it, and I recall numerous strange quirks. The code simply
did not seem to be mature in the manner of WS3.x. Though I did not
experience what you describe, the red flag above is that "the disk
"goes bad" every so often." This simply does not happen unless there
are problems.

Suggestion: start over with a fresh working disk and see what happens.

FYI, rec.games.int-fiction is the proper place for questions like
this: rec.arts.int-fiction is for discussion of the art of writing
interactive fiction.  Followups are directed appropriately :)

Copyrights on Infocom games are still held.  You cannot get them in
the public domain and I don't expect that to change in the near
future.  The sources are even less available (you can't even illegally
copy them from your friends ;).

Mediagenic has released both "Lost Treasures of Infocom", with 20
Infocom games, for IBM PC-compatibles, Macintoshes, and Amiga systems.
Maps for each game are included, and a book containing photocopies of
(almost) all the relevant bits from the packages, and another booklet
containing the complete hints for each game.  The hints booklet is
*very* poorly done, with spelling and formatting errors abounding.
But I never use hints so I don't care :)

"Lost Treasures of Infocom II", with 11 more games, has been released
for IBM PC-compatibles and Macintoshes.  This is much more
professionally-done package (I guess the success of LTOI I prompted
them to put a little more work into LTOI II :), but it doesn't contain
any hints, just maps and a book of package materials.  It also
contains a card where you can order "Leather Goddesses of Phobos" for
$9.95+S&H (IBM PC version only).

This means all except 4 (I think) Infocom games are currently
available.

I will be re-posting my Infocom game data table to
rec.games.int-fiction momentarily; it has much of the same info as is
contained in Paul David Doherty's fact sheet posted here recently, but
in a more compact, table form.

Email me if you want a copy via email.

Hi,
	I have a CCS system with the CCS CPU and the CCS FDC. I want
to put ZCPR3 on it, but am having problems modifying my BIOS to do
the necessary initialization. The documentation mentions that I may
get some help from others who have put ZCPR3 on their CCS systems.

	So, I am wondering if anyone has ZCPR3 on their CCS systems,
and could maybe help me out. I think all I need to have is the
CCBIOS.ASM file, appropriately modified for ZCPR3. Can anyone help
me?

   I have tried to respond directly to "godel!oscsf@news.pgh.wec.com", who
posted a message that appeared in the INFO-CPM digest asking about acquiring
a Kaypro II computer.  My messages keep bouncing.  Could you please send me
direct email (SAGE@LL.MIT.EDU).

   For others reading this, I still have lots of Kaypro parts available.  I
stripped down two machines so far.  I've got power supplies, video supplies,
motherboards, and keyboards.  There are more machines that can be stripped
down as well.  I would like to reclaim the room in my basement that is
serving as a Kaypro warehouse and also get this equipment into the hands of
people who can put it to use.

   Quite a number of people responded to my earlier posting.  It took me a
while to find the time to strip the machines down and get messages back to
them.  Everyone should have heard from me.  If you haven't, please send me
mail.  I would especially like to hear from the person who wanted the K10
hard disk, which is ready to be shipped.

Yes, CP/M wants to warm-boot to its A: drive. The easy solution is for
you to make *all* of your discs bootable. The system tracks are
reserved for this pupose, so doing so will not take up extra disc
capacity, as in DOS. They, any disc will do!

You don't have to keep the system disk in A:.  You just need a bootable disk
with a copy of PIP or similar utility (such as NSWP or COPY; I get most of my
programs from GEnie, but you can probably ftp them from simtel20.wsmr.army.mil).
On most CP/M systems you make a boot disk by running SYSGEN.

Yes, you must keep a boot disk in the A: drive.  If you boot off a hard
drive that's not a problem.  Another alternative I've used is to install
a RAM disk, SYSGEN the RAM disk and then overlay the BIOS so the RAM disk
becomes drive A:.  You should also extend the device select jumpers
of the floppy drive out to the back so you can change it from A to C,
or just hang a third floppy drive on your system.

PIP is not smart enough to allow swapping diskettes.  Use SWEEP or
NSWEEP instead.

Sorry, can't help here.  I'd love a S-100 hard disk controller myself.

Henry, it's likely that source changes would have to be made.

Best way I can think of running this program, since your friend
is thinking of porting it to a 386 machine, is to get a copy of
Simeon Cran's MYZ80 CP/M emulator for DOS (286 or above) systems.
Then just run have your friend continue running it as a CP/M
application, but on his DOS machine. It should run faster under
CP/M emulation on a 386 than it did on the old machine.

Hi,
  Is anyone familiar with  Micro 5 Turbo system ?  Does the company
still exist today ?  Since I am not very CP/M literate, maybe some of
you CP/M gurus can help me out.
One of my friends' company has a Micro 5 System running an acounting
program (written in MBASIC). The system is a multi-user system and 
has 24 serial ports on the back.  Since the system is very old, he
is afraid the system may die someday and lose all of his data.
He would like to replace the machine with a standard 386 compatiable PC
The Questions that I have are: 

1) Can I replace the MP/M with another multi-user operating system
   such as DR. DOS mult-user version or DesQview running on top of 
   regular DOS ?
2) Will the accounting program run on DOS ?  (I do have the
   source code if I need to make minor modification to the program.)

Thank you very much.  
/Henry

What you need is one of the LU (Library Utility) variants, like
LU.COM - I've been using NULU152.COM for quite a while now.
Check any of the SIMTEL mirror sites for CP/M software.

DRI was recently bought up by Novell, so you might inquire of them regarding
proprietary rights, etc.  Yes, there are a few folks still actively
developing stuff for CP/M, or actually for the upward compatable equivalent
of it, ZCPR34 which runs on the same machines.  There are a number of BBS's
around the world (known as Z-nodes) which feature ZCPR3 software and
exchange information with interested users.  CP/M has been religated to
pretty much of a hobby status, and most of the Z system folks are pretty
much like ham radio operators - the do it for fun and are enthusiastic about
it.  I run a CP/M BBS (Z-node #77) and am still an advocate of CP/M as an
educational operating system since it's pretty completely known and quite
transparent if you get down to studying it.  As one of my CP/M
correspondants said, "I studied MS-DOS to learn how applications work - I
studied CP/M to learn how computers work".  There is even a magazine - The
Computer Journal -which devotes considerable space to CP/M and ZCPR3 topics. 
I suggest you check on to Z-node #3 and explore.  The number is 617-965-7259.
Jay Sage, the friendly sysop thereof, also owns Sage Microsystems East which
markets a number of fine CP/M and ZCPR3 products, some of which Jay has
rescued from a one way journey to the ash heap of computer history.

I strongly suggest that if you plan to do any software development for CP/M
you contact Jay and others in the Z System community and make your product
ZCPR3 aware, since the improvements in ZCPR3 over DRI's original CP/M are
very signifigant and intelligent.

from Columbia, at any rate) on a Kaypro II running CP/M 2.2 .

I've no file-transfer software for this beast at all, just a wretched
terminal program called TERM that sort of emulates an ADM 3A.  Following the
instructions in cpskerm.doc, I carefully typed into DDT the capture program
from the kermit distribution(cpkfet.ddt), saved it, logged into the Unix host
with the hex files, changing the prompt to '@' as expected by the program, and
entered 'cat cpskerm.hex' minus the CR.  I then exited TERM program and ran
the capture program, but (surprise) nothing happened, nothing at all.  No modem
activity whatsoever, which would seem to indicate that perhaps the program
isn't talking to the right device?  But that's just a wild guess, since I'm
almost completely CP/M clueless.  I believe IOBYTE is ok; at least I didn't
consciously do anything to modify it.

Alternatively, I could just type in all the .ASM sources and assemble it
myself, but ASM is the only assembler I've got, and apparently it won't cut
it for building Kermit.  No .ASM source for LASM is provided with the
Kermit stuff, only a .HEX, and I can't imagine trying to type that in.

So, I'm open to any and all suggestions(aside from converting the machine
into a doorstop, that is).  E-mail would probably be best, but posted replies
are fine.  Thanks much in advance!

While it is not yet known for sure, the problem described above appears
to me as if Susan has found the infamous BDOS Function 37 bug. She is
now checking to see if that was indeed her problem. To save others her
grief, I thought I'd post the information I sent to her. Everyone who
has not yet installed a BDOS replacement must at least become aware of
this bug and decide for themselves whether or not to patch their BDOS.

The following text is from the file NULU151.INF contained in the
library NULU152A.LBR. I have deleted much that is not relevant and you
will find my comments in square brackets with my initials.


-------------------------begin extraction-------------------------------

[Extracted from: NULU152.INF, a file included with NULU152A.LBR, a
library utility program - DCK]

<much stuff deleted -DCK>

The  other  problem  - that  of  overcoming  the  BDOS  error  is   more
complicated.  The  simplest  way  would be to fix the BDOS  and  I  have
included a patch to the Digital Research BDOS for those who wish to make
the change. There are dangers inherent with fixing the BDOS however, and
I would strongly recommend leaving things the way they are.  My argument
for leaving things is as follows:

The  CP/M 2.2 BDOS is a stable product and can be guaranteed to  perform
in exactly the same way for every user.  Knowing its limitations,  it is
possible to overcome the problems caused by the bug(s).  If all users of
NULU were to patch their BDOSes,  they may one day come across a program
which  works  BECAUSE  of  the bug and hence would  not  work  on  their
systems.  Similarly,  any software developed on a 'fixed' BDOS cannot be
guaranteed to work on an unfixed BDOS.  However, I include the patch and
leave it up the users to decide. Freedom of choice is everyones right.

The  BDOS bug although related to function 37 is not,  in fact,  in that
function  but in the Select Disk function (function 14).  Problems  will
only be caused under the following circumstances:

1. The default drive has been reset, AND

2. Data has been written to the default drive since the disk reset, AND

3. Some sort of disk activity is requested on a different drive.

The  BDOS  keeps  a 16 bit variable (the login vector) which  shows  the
login state for each of drives A-P.  In the vector,  each bit represents
one drive and is set if the drive is logged in.  As records are  written
to disk,  the allocation vector in the BIOS is used to maintain a record
of  those  disk blocks allocated to the file.  The allocation vector  is
updated  as blocks are written to disk but is initially set up from  the
disk  directory  when the drive is first logged  in.  BDOS  function  37
simply  resets  the appropriate bit(s) in the login vector which  should
cause the drive to be relogged on the next access.

Unfortunately,  Digital  Research  maintain  an  internal  variable  for
holding  the last drive accessed and check it before logging in a  disk.
If  the requested drive is the same as the last,  then the BDOS  assumes
that  it  is already logged in and it doesn't check the login vector  at
all.  If  we have reset the default drive,  the internal  variable  will
still  say that is is logged in,  even though the login vector bit  will
have  been  reset.  Disk writes may still be made to this drive and  the
allocation vector will still be updated.

If we were now to temporarily switch drives to do a read,  for  example.
The  internal  variable  will reflect this and NEXT time we  access  the
default drive,  the BDOS's check will now say "Ah,  a different drive  -
check the login vector".  When this happens, of course, it will find the
bit  for  this  drive is reset and will re-read the  disk  directory  to
update the allocation vector.

The  disk  directory is only updated when either an extent  boundary  is
passed (every 16k) or when the file is closed.  Consequently,  unless we
are lucky,  the disk directory will not show the last few disk writes we
have  made and those bits will be reset in the allocation  vector.  This
means  that as far as the BDOS is concerned,  those blocks are free  for
use  and  it will use them again - even if it means allocating the  same
block(s) twice to the same file.

In context of NULU,  assume that a library, resident on drive A, is open
and  that  we  are currently logged into drive B (ie:  drive  B  is  the
default  drive).  Assume  that we wish to extract a 100k member file  to
drive  B.  NULU  creates a buffer when the library is opened  and  a  2k
buffer for the file to be extracted.  The buffer for the library will be
a  large percentage of the remaining TPA size but suffice to say that it
will  be smaller than our member file.  We then fill the library  buffer
with  the  first part of the member file and reset drive B in  case  the
disk  has  been changed - condition 1 is then satisfied.  We  now  start
writing  out the member file (condition 2) until the library  buffer  is
exhausted.  We  then  need  to read more of the library from drive  A  -
condition 3.

<more stuff deleted - mostly NULU specific code - DCK>

On another subject altogether,  the additions of code to save and resore
the S2 byte are to do with files larger than 512k. It may be of interest
to  note that Digital Research 'forgot' to document that the S2 byte  is
an overflow extent byte.  Anyone who has tried to edit a text file under
Wordstar  will  probably have found that it goes bananas when  the  file
size  exceeds  512k.  Wordstar is not alone in this,  there are  several
other  commercial  and PD programs that suffer badly when  dealing  with
files greater than 512k.

Digital  Research  say that CP/M 2.2 can handle files of up to  8Mb  and
CP/M  Plus can handle files up to 32Mb.  They also say that  the  extent
byte  (under 2.2 and Plus) can vary between 0 and 31 in use - under CP/M
1.4  this was 0 to 15.  Now 32 times 16k is nowhere near 8Mb  let  alone
32Mb,  in fact it comes to that magic figure of 512k - this is where the
S2  byte  comes in.  The S2 byte counts the multiples of 512k used in  a
file  and may range from 0 to 15 under CP/M 2.2 (bits 0-3) and 0  to  63
under CP/M Plus (bits 0-6).  Bit 7 of the S2 byte is used by the BDOS as
an internal 'archive' bit.  When a file is opened, an examination of the
S2 byte will show a value of 80H.  If any write is performed to the file
in question,  this bit will be cleared.  When the close file function is
called,  if  the bit is set then no action is required.  If it is clear,
the  disk  directory is updated.

<more NULU specific code deleted - DCK>

The DRI BDOS fix
----------------

Zero  out the following locations in the DRI BDOS,  note that  the  BDOS
starts  6  bytes before the address at location 0006H and that  ZSID/DDT
etc.  will not give the true address. Use something like Z3LOC or STATUS
to  determine your BDOS address.  The bytes at those locations and  what
they do are given so that you can patch away with confidence.

Location to patch       Byte at that location (Hex)
                     (xx = depends upon BDOS address)

BDOS + 0C45H                    3A         LDA xxD6H     ; Get wanted drive
BDOS + 0C46H                    D6
BDOS + 0C47H                    xx
BDOS + 0C48H                    21         LXI H,xx42H   ; Get last drive
BDOS + 0C49H                    42
BDOS + 0C4AH                    xx
BDOS + 0C4BH                    BE         CMP M         ; Same drive?
BDOS + 0C4CH                    C8         RZ            ; Return if it is

[Note: only the RZ code at 0c4ch need be set to zero - DCK]

This patch prevents the BDOS from using its internal saved record of the
last  drive  accessed  and forces it to check the login vector  bits  to
determine whether or not to relog a drive.

The patch above works but on your own head be it!


-------------------------end of extraction------------------------------ 


As a final note, anyone who is running one of the BDOS replacements, P2DOS,
NovaDOS, ZRDOS, ZSDOS, and so on, should find that this bug has been fixed.
I all my 14 years of CP/M, I have never encountered a program that required
the bug present to work properly. (Insert weasel words here) Thats not to
say such a program doesn't exist, just that I have not found it yet.

Subject: CP/M FOR TRS-80 MODEL III, 48K
Message-ID: <16B551047E.R3DRS@VM1.CC.UAKRON.EDU>

I have recently aquired a TRS-80 Model III, but with no software (other than a
couple bootable TRSDOS V1.2 with nothing else useful on them).  Knowing that
CP/M was a very popular replacement for TRDOS, i am interested in finding some
sort of version of this operating system so i might make some use of this
machine.  Could someone point me to a source for something i could use?
I did find something that looked promising that came with a Z80 emulator for
MS DOS, but i think that it might be for a 64K system (mine is 48K).  Is there
a good CP/M source available through the internet?  Also, how about software?
 
                    Thanks in advance,  Dave Snyder   r3drs@vm1.cc.uakron.edu

Message-ID: <4361.9301121751@clus1.ulcc.ac.uk>

I was interested in the post about the lodd off data in Wordstar 4.0
and Don Kirkpatrick's post about the BDOS function 37. Some years ago
I and otherws were using DEC rainbows with WS 3.00 and found that WS would
occasionally lose blocks of text. The files were nowehere near
512 K long. As far as I could discover the text lost was always in a
secondary, non-contiguous extent.

Recently colleagues have been having a similar problem with WS 4.0 on
MS-DOS systems. Text after the first 1K of the file is sometimes lost and
the file is cross-linked with another. So far this has only been
detected on floppy disk directories, not on hard disks.


I know that strictly this is a problem for info-ibmpc, not info-cpm,
but it may be that the CP/M and MS-DOS faults are related. I should
be grateful for any help that can be offered.

The .LBR format is an archive format without compression used frequently for
bundling of CP/M program components which are usually compressed before
being archived.  You will want to look for the programs LU, NULU, LGET,
DELBR (or DE-LBR) or LT (Library Typer, also capable of extraction) to
extract files from a LBR archive.  If the files within the LBR archive have
the filespec *.?Q? you may well need the progrum USQ or UNSQUEEZ to
uncompress the component files.  If the files have the format *.?Z? you will
need UNCR or UNCRUNCH to uncompress them.  SIMTEL20 used to have an
exhaustive catalog of CP/M public domain utilities available for ftp.  If
you are in the US, there are a number of bulletin boards which specialize in
CP/M software.  I suggest you contact Jay Sage's BBS at 617-965-7259 for a
good selection.

It should be noted that most versions of UNCR will also unsqueeze and UNSQ
is not required.  The latest that I have seen - UNCRLZH - also handles that
compression mode as well.

A bit late in responding but it took me a while to find my
documentation.

There are several options for HD add-ons to S-100 systems.  

I use(d) a DTC S-100 SASI interface board connected to an OMTI controller.
This gave me 2 5.25" floppies and 2 ST-506 hd's.  The Xebec 1410 and Sysgen
series would also work, they were all SASI interfaced.

The DTC SASI interface supported DMA but the board was generally shipped
with no DMA logic installed.  It should be possible to use an 8255 or
the like to build a polled IO SASI interface.

A second option is/was the XCOMP ST/S and ST/R.  The ST/S was for S-100
systems, ST/R for 'other'.  The ST/R was installed by adding an adapter
between the original Z80 in your CPU and the ST/R controller set.

If someone is particularly interested in the SASI interface option, I
have several OMTI and Xebec controllers.  I still have a DTC SASI
interface but the decision to get rid of it is pending :-)

There is still some CP/M development going on in the UK, largely for Amstrad's
PCW series of Z80 word-processors.  These are marketed with a wp called
Locoscript, which is self-booting, although using CP/M disk format.  This may
have changed since I had one at home; the more recent ones have 3.5" disks, not
the far less common 3" disks they originally used, and may have moved over to
MS-DOS format to aid file transfer to Locoscript PC).  When I had one of these
machines (bought in 1984 and still going strong in 1990), it was running CP/M
Plus (3.14), which I was programming using a really great suite consisting of
Debugger/Disassembler, Full-screen editor, and Z80 macro assembler, called
Devpac80.  This was written by a company called HiSoft based in Dunstable, UK,
who write and/or market a wide variety of compilers for CP/M 2.2 and later.
The last catalogue I had included at least two different C compilers, Pascal,
Fortan, Forth, Pilot, Modula-2, Prolog, Devpac80, and various flavours of
BASIC, including Locomotive's Mallard BASIC, said to be the most powerful 8-bit
BASIC around.  Mallard BASIC is also bundled with Amstrad PCW machines.

As far as I am aware these are still marketed (HiSoft's stall at the 1991
Computer Shopper Show had most of these for sale), and they are pretty cheap;
about L35.00 per package.  For serious CP/M hobbyists, they maight be worth
trying to get hold of.  Anyone who's interested please mail me, and I'll e-mail
you HiSoft's address which I will dig out at home.

Subject: LBR Files and Compression
Message-ID: <9301141001.AA20940@LL.MIT.EDU>

   Lindsay Haisley's list of tools for dealing with LBR archives containing
compressed files omitted my favorite: LBREXT.  This program will extract
member files from libraries and optionally uncompress them from squeezed
(*.?q?), crunched (*.?z?), and LZH encoded (*.?y?) format.  LBREXT is a full
Z-System program that will work perfectly under standard CP/M as well to the
extent possible.  The syntax is

        LBREXT lbrfile[.LBR] member1[,member2,...] [/option]

The LBR file name can be given with or without the LBR extension.  One may
give a single member file specification (which may be 'ambiguous', that is,
contain '?' or '*') or a number of such specifications separated by commas. 
The option '/U' specifies that any matching compressed member files are to
be uncompressed as they are extracted.  I believe the '/O' option specifies
the the extracted file(s) should overwrite any that already exist.

   Lindsay was nice enough to mention my Z-Node as a good source for these
files.  The Z-Node concentrates on files that run specifically under Z-
System.  I operate a second BBS (running on DOS hardware with PCBoard, two
phone lines, and high-speed modems) at 617-965-7046.  That BBS supports
general CP/M and MS-DOS and has a directory dedicated to support of
archiving and compression.  At the moment, the main phone number has a
v.32bis modem.  If that line is busy, the connection hunts to the second
line (617-965-7785) which has a USRobotics Courier HST modem.  However, I am
about to reverse these lines so that people with v.32bis modems can
guarantee connection to my v.32bis modem by calling the second number
directly.  That switch may have occurred by the time you read this message.

This rings a bell. I remember having trouble with WS4 when editing large
files on a floppy based machine. Especially when inserting a block from
another file. Parts of the file would disappear and other parts get scrambled.

I came to the conclusion that the code just isn't as stable as previous
versions. Unfortunately I can't reproduce this problem using my CP/M
emulator (MYZ80) on the IBM clone, which runs CP/M 3.0. It's as stable as
a rock.

    I have answered directly with more details, but more people than Mark
might want to know that:
-The DEC Rainbow has 2 processors, a Z80 which can run CP/M-80 code, and a
 8086 which can run either CP/M-86 or MSDOS.
-There exists a good Z80 Fortran compiler, FORTRAN-80 by Microsoft. Against
 a statement by Microsoft that they make/made it public, I will gladly send
 a copy, with the documentation which I have kept, limited  to operating
 instructions and machine dependencies. Remember: MEMORY(Z80) =< 64Kbytes !
-Any so-called PC compiler running on a PC or XT (that is, on 8086 and 8088
 processors) such as Microsoft's, Lahey's, Waterloo, and probably (not tested
 but very educated guess) the BCF compiler located in <MSDOS.FORTRAN> at
 SIMTEL20, will run on a Rainbow with two caveats: a) Lahey's require a 8087
 coprocessor even for compilation jobs even if the program does not use any
 real number, b) of course no graphics library made for the PC will work.
-Too many Rainbow owners have not had a chance to hear that very many packages
 made for the PC (XT, 8088, that is, not AT's 286/386/486, just in case you
 dream) will run flawless on the Rainbow. The border line is very easily
 defined, any package writing I/O thru BIOS calls will work, any package
 writing directly into the device will fail. In less cryptic language, games
 and packages "optimised" for speed I/O will normally fail, the rest will
 work. Many commercial packages (examples: KEDIT, REXX) have a documented or
 hidden option to enforce BIOS I/O to screen: with that option on, they do
 run on Rainbows, although (often very much) slower. Packages that come with
 customization options for various "terminals" will work on the Rainbow if
 installed as VT220 (memory mapped when option is available).
-A few examples of free software found on SIMTEL20 with which a science
 student can get a lot of work out of a Rainbow 100, under MSDOS: JOVE to
 edit texts, TEX to produce high quality documents, SMALL-C to write in C,
 COMPAS to write in Pascal, almost certainly BCF for Fortran. I would bet
 that there IS a data base and that there IS a spreadsheet that will work, one
 just needs a little bit of patience to try the packages until one finds the
 good one. Of course there is at Columbia a version of Kermit for the Rainbow,
 and the Rainbow is also in any case a VT100 terminal (at least VT220 in fact).
-What you really need to enjoy your Rainbow is a hard disk. With a bit of luck,
 the old Rainbow left over there might have 768k RAM, which could help convince
 those who don't believe that MSDOS does work beyond 640K  (up to 1 Mb, but
 IBM castrated again...). Still, without a hard disk, the Rainbow is frustra-
 ting.

Tee-hee.  I remember writing an entire Arkanoid clone in Z80 assembler for my
Amstrad PCW8256.  The code fit into 2k, including all the graphics routines I'd
written, and the data for the levels took another 4k.  Compare that with
DOS/Windoze where the smallest program I've written was 16k (and did virtually
nothing).  Even worse is the Unix clone Linux, which I also run on my PC, which
common to many C compilers, it seems, generates absolutely huge binaries.  I
have 8Mb of RAM in my PC and X Windows stumbles after only a couple of
reasonable programs.  The Amstrad PCW uses a banked memory system (most
machines are fitted with 256k or 512k).  I never managed to fill even 64k, but
there you go.  I never wrote in anything other than assembler, and I suppose
64k of machine code is a pretty hefty program.  Now that I have a PC capable of
running a Z80 emulator at the same speed as a native Z80A, I might get back
into CP/M, because it's the only operating system I've ever been able to
clearly understand in its entirety.  I'm glad to see there's such interest in
CP/M still around.

To avoid unnecessary net traffic, let it be said that I already have 22DISK

One cannot run programs (or operating systems) designed for use on Intel
80x86 based system (MS-DOS, PC-DOS, DR-DOS, etc.) on the older 8080 or Z80
based systems (CP/M, TP/M, CP/M+ etc.) or vice versa (without and emulator). 
I assume the Micro 5 System falls into the latter category and that MP/M is
a CP/M workalike.  It is possible that one could get the programs up and
running on an AT with the help of an emulator such as MYZ80, but it would
probably be slower than on the Micro 5, and I'm not sure what I/O support is
available in these environments.  It is highly doubtful that the Micro 5's
support of 24 serial ports could be translated into anything meaningful in a
DOS environment.

You may be able to translate the BASIC programs into GWBASIC or another
dialect which will run under DOS.  BASIC is not as easily transported as C
or other languages which were designed work across different platforms, so
I'm not sure how "minor" the modifications will be, and, depending on the
complexity of the programs, the job may turn you into a BASIC expert,
assuming you have the time for the required research.

From a cost/time point of view, the most economical solution might well be
for your friend to print out as much data as possible from your old system
and then reenter it manually into one of the excellent accounting packages
available for use in a DOS environment.  If necessary, you may be able to
move the data files and source code from your Micro 5 to an AT on floppies
using Uniform-PC from MicroSolutions or 22DISK from Sydex, both of which are
excellent products for the purpose.

I'm not familiar with the CCS system but have installed ZCPR33 and ZCPR34 on
Kaypro systems.  I don't recall that any BIOS modifications are required
(although it's been some time since I've done the job).  ZCPR3 is
essentially a CCP replacement and (especially in the case of ZCPR34 with
NZ-COM) should require only the initialization of the ZCPR3-specific data
structures which describe your system layout.

A stock (non-modified) TRS-80 Model III will not run CP/M as RS used the
lower 14K for EPROMs, memory mapped I/O space, and video memory. I have
heard of modifications to the Model III that will remap these into the 
upper 16K (basically remap the top two address lines), and then some other
hardware to handle the initial hardware boot (ie: a shadow EPROM at 0 that
can be mapped out, or something). Anyway, CP/M can run on it, but you must
get your soldering iron out (Or be lucky enough to locate one of the
retrofit kits for the Model III that just plugged in - I think it was a
daughter board that plugged into the Z80 socket, with the Z80 relocated to
the daughter board).

The TRS-80 Model IV, and the portable (actually more of a 'luggable') IVP
could run TRSDOS or CP/M. Maybe you could locate one of these....

Good luck.

PS: Rereading the above, I realized that I assume that you know that CP/M
    requires a contiguous RAM area starting at address $0000. Just thought
    I would point it out for the CP/M newbies...   ;-}

Any bootable disk in CP/M has the system on the system tracks and is by
definition a "system disk".  Such a disk must remain in his A: drive during
a warm boot.

   What is that format?  I can see if my copy of MM supports it.  Another
approach would be to develop a custom format specification for 22DISK.  If
you have one of these diskettes, you can use Sydex's ANADISK program to
analyze the disk and learn some things about its format structure.  Building
a definition table for 22DISK is not intrinsically difficult.

As far as I am aware, MP/M is a multi-user version of CP/M with many extra
features, such as scheduling, print spooling and so on.  We used to have a
network of Z80 machines at school, all connected to a Z80 fileserver (wow...
such speed!) running MP/M.  It also had a relocatable form of executable, .PRL
files rather than .COM  I presume these were a forerunner of MS-DOS .EXE
executables.

Digital Research did the same trick with DR-DOS and produced Concurrent DOS for
PC's.

I do have a CP/M version (which I use from time to time on a DEC Rainbow).
I couldn't instantly find the box and the book.
If the info is still needed, write to me directly with the format you
are looking for, I'll boot up the old Rainbow to check.
My bet however is that you will save time and money by asking at large
what are the 22DSK parameters for the diskette you want to read; adjusting
22DSK is then trivial.

The company is Intersecting Concepts.  I don't have their address or
phone number handy just now.  Be careful of MediaMaster.  They advertise
bunches of CP/M formats, but I suggested it to a colleague of mine and
after paying a very high price for the software, he found it wouldn't
work for his format.  He asked me to try it on some others, and I was
not able to read the only 2 other formats that were on their list of
formats supported, and available to me.  When I tried to talk to them
about the problem over the phone, they were very rude, and no help at all.

As I have said before, others have tried the product and liked it.  Perhaps
it works with the more common formats.  My experience was quite different.
I use, and swear by, 22DISK.

I suggest that you have your friend buy a supported copy of 22DISK.  The
vendor claims that they will help a user define just about any format to
the program.  If your friend decides to buy MediaMaster, please...please..
get him/her to try (somehow) out the particular format of interest *BEFORE*
he/she writes the check

Subject: Re: ZCPR3 on California Computer Systems Machine
Message-ID: <9301151247.AA18104@LL.MIT.EDU>

   A manual installation of ZCPR3 requires some modest changes to the system
BIOS.  First, the BIOS must be moved down in memory to open up space for the
ZCPR3 buffers (multiple command line buffer, environment buffer, path
buffer, named directory register, shell stack, etc.).  If MOVCPM is
available, it should be able to handle that job.  In addition, the buffers
must be initialized.  If you have the CBIOS source code, this poses no
problems in principle.  If you don't have source, then you have to patch
into the cold boot code (before it merges, as it sometimes does, with the
warm boot code).  Writing this code is not difficult in principle, but
putting all the pieces together -- the parts you write and the existing BIOS
object code -- can be a little tricky.

   Fortunately, none of this is necessary any more in the overwhelming
majority of cases.  NZCOM takes care of everything automatically.  A menu-
based utility allows you to design your system configuration or
configurations.  If you have more than one, you can change among them
without rebooting.  In fact, you can change operating systems right in the
middle of a multiple command sequence, which means that alias scripts can
potentially do it automatically.  System modules are provided in a run-time
relocatable format so that nothing has to be assembled or reassembled for
use at a new address.  Even the command processor, BDOS, and BIOS interface
modules can be reloaded while the system is running!  In short, an NZCOM-
created Z-System is superior to a manually installed system.  There are only
two drawbacks: a memory penalty of 256 bytes and a financial cost of $49.

   The manual that comes with NZCOM provides a minimal introduction to Z-
System.  The most valuable source of information is The Computer Journal
magazine, where I have been writing a regular column for about six years and
where several other Z-System developers and users have also published
frequently.

Message-ID: <C0x26n.26t@undergrad.math.waterloo.edu>

Okay, okay, this isn't comp.os.hdos, but comp.os.hdos doesn't exist.

A Heath H-89 computer will be coming into my possession shortly.
I have some software for it, including CP/M 2.2.04 and HDOS 2.0.
I was wondering:

     1) Is there anyone out there who knows where I might get a copy
        of the HDOS source code? I know that it was available at one
        point in time, but that was several years ago. If you still
        have a copy that you no longer need, please let me know.

     2) Does anyone know where I can get a copy of HDOS 3.0? Again,
        I know that it was once available (for the cost of disks and
        shipping!) but that was quite some time ago. Is it actually
        public-domain? If so, is there perhaps an ftp site that might
        have it? How about by snail-mail?

     3) What is the status of ZCPR and ZR-DOS? I have read several
        postings about them, but still haven't figured out if they
        are public domain or commercial. Please enlighten me and
        include sources where I might get the full system.

In the interest of netiquette, please do not post replies to the
news-group. E-mail me directly and I will summarize my findings if
there is sufficient interest. My e-mail address is:

        dpejcha@napier.uwaterloo.ca

PS: Any information about other HDOS or H89-specific software would
    also be greatly appreciated.

Thank you (in advance) one and all

The only sure way to find out if it will work is to try it.  Some programs
initialize themselves in such a fashion that a reentry to the code after
initialization won't work, while others are more forgiving.  My experience
is that among more complex programs (which include those generated with
Pascal and C compilers) a successful reentry to the executed code (which is
what you will be SAVEing) is the exception rather than the rule, but again,
you should try it.

Message-ID: <727299604.AA01100@contrast.wlink.nl>

Hi All,

I have been trying to get 22disk, Xenocopy and some other, comparable
CP/M disk converters to run on my 386 clone for weeks now, but they all
fail to work. I spent most of my effort on 22disk, which reports a
'drive not ready' after it starts to read the CP/M disk that was
supposed to be converted. The drive starts spinning for a second or so,
then the error message appears and the drive stops.

This happens with disks from all kinds of CP/M machines (Cromemco,
Superbrain, Epson, IBM CP/M 86). It also happens when I try to format an
alien disk. Once, just once, I got it working for a few minutes, but
that was all.

Is there something I don't know? Fidgeting with BIOS settings and
drivparm didn't help me. Do you need some special disk controller? My
clone is equipped with one of the newer multi I/O cards.

Well, in short: Help!


Groeten,

           Oscar

Message-ID: <lleuakINNrto@utkcs2.cs.utk.edu>

Question:  I want to write a two-step program in Turbo Pascal -- The question
is will what I want to do work.

I want Step1 to read in and fill various arrays.  (The arrays are going to 
be relatively constant, and I am trying to avoid filling them every 
time I execute the program.  The arrays will probably have 300-ish elements 
in several arrays -- to much to really fill "by hand".  Besides, the data 
will change from time to time (it is actually Family data (birthdays, 
anniversaries, etc.))).  Then I want to Chain (?) to Step2 which will 
actually run the program applications.

If I exit the program immediately after chaining, and then SAVE the program,
will I be able to execute Step2 only (with its nicely filled arrays.
If this won't work, is there some cute trick that I can do to make it work?

Exactly what state in program execution does the SAVE statement get it?  (If
I am misunderstanding the operation of the Save statement, forgive my
obviously idiotic ramblings.)

Thanks

This one I can answer, because I first had this problem with my Intertec
Compustar (relatives of the SuperBrain).  I found I had to format the 
Compustar disk on the DOS machine with 22Disk's CFMT /com3 Du: command,
but then could easily read and write the data from the Intertec computers.
The CP/M machine does not write the proper header on the DOS disk for the
DOS machine to recognize that there is a disk there.  

Try to format the disk on the DOS machine, and then copy files to it.  I have
had beautiful luck with this technique.  (Kaypro format works fine from the 
Kaypro, it must set up the 'boot track' that the DOS machine recognizes that
it has a formated disk in it).

The biggest challenge is probably discerning whether MP/M features were

is not likely that MBASIC knew about MP/M though.

Having delved into the HP-125 myself as a self-training course in how an
operating system works, I'll wager you're running into some problems with
function keys and screen paging.  HP made their CP/M quite specific to the
machine and made use of several 'pages' of screen memory, as well as ANSI
screen display logic, and multiple-use function keys.

As far as I could tell, they never intended it to be used often as a
standalone CP/M machine, but rather as a "word processor/Basic Programming/
Spreadsheet" machine.  The specifics of the hardware is probably what is
killing you.  Best of luck in getting it to work ... I don't think you will.

I have had no trouble with 22disk installed on a 486 clone. But I
did have to reinstall it - I had originally copied it over from my
previous XT, and that installation gave problems. If you have been
using an incomplete 22disk from a friend's machine,
that may be the problem. Get the full current version from Simtel20.
You may need the registered version for some formats.
The registered version has more formats than the shareware version.
Make sure that the specifications for the drives and other
features of your system are set correctly when you install 22disk.

Alternatively the problem could be with your drive cache or PC
speed. If you have a turbo switch, try switching it so that the
computer is set on 'slow' (i.e. AT) speed. If you use
Smartdrv or another drive cache, try altering the buffering settings
for the floppy drive. (I have not found that a turbo setting caused
problems for 22disk, but I have found that a program designed to
read TRS-80 disks on older PCs could not read the floppies unless
the turbo was set OFF, and moreover could not format alien disks unless the
write cache for the floppy drive was switched ON.)

There are other tricks that sometimes work, such as covering the
index hole on the floppy with a write-protect tab.

Are you operating under any sort of multitasking software (MS-Windows,
DesqView, etc.)?  If so, you should exit your multitasking environment and
run under plain MS-DOS.  22DISK (and probably similar software as well)
makes system calls which are not supported under some multitasking
environments.  If this isn't the case, I have found Sydex to be friendly and
helpful with problems.  Contact them at:

Subject: How to convert a MP/M tape to UNIX?
Message-ID: <1993Jan20.220845.22103@philce.ce.philips.nl>

Hello netlanders,

I'm having a bit trouble converting a tape written on a
PHILIPS P3800 Turbo-DOS (MP/M) system to a more familiar format
like tar.

The tape has been written using the "savestr" command on the MP/M 
system. I don't know if this is a standard MP/M command, but it gives
the possibility to write a disk partition to 1/4" tape.
I don't have any more information on this command or the format of the
data.

I want to read the tape onto my SUN. I do get data off the tape, but not
in any understandable format.

So I am looking for a MP/M utility to write a tape in a known format, or
for a UNIX utility to read the tape and convert it.
If there is no such utility I have to use 5.25" floppies and I will need
one of the utilities I have been reading about in this newsgroup like 
22DISK.

Is there a ftp site where I can get me a copy of 22DISK?

Any HELP appreciated.

TIA and regards,

There were two copies of the compiler supplied:

cii      <- produced 8080 code
czii(?)  <- produced Z-80 code

for pure z80 you also needed to recompile the libraries using the z80
compiler. instructions on how to do this were provided.

Well, I have Aztec C 1.06d and I have two versions of the compiler.

     'CC' generates 8080 code only
     'CZ' generates Z80 code in 'extended Intel' format

As someone once pointed out, the Z80 compiler really doesn't take full
advantage of the Z80's instruction set.  I ran a small program through
both and didn't see any difference in the output.

Besides, the library routines would have to all be in 8080 code anyway.

I don't know the default settings, but the switches are buffered

After that it's all down to the software...

SUSAN FARMER asked about writing "a two-step program in Turbo Pascal."  Her
scheme sounded problematical to me.  If it fails, another approach would be
to keep the initialization data in a file and have the Turbo program read it
in.  Changing that data would be easier that way, too.  You could even have
an option within the program to write out its data to a file.

Don't know about 1.05g, but the 1.06d manual says the difference is the 
addition of two register variables (from two to four).

I don't suppose so.  You can run the target code through a disassembler
and see what you get.  If you are sure you are in code and see JR to
a reasonable address, it's Z80 code.  If you see only JP (JMP) instructions
is is probably 8080 code.  8085 is identical to 8080 code except for

It may not be quite as simple as you think.  How do you know if you are
looking at code, data or random garbage?  What you want is a superset
of a disassembler and those generally need a lot of user interventioon.

Consider the following:  (This is based on actual code)

   ...
   call print
   db   'Hello, world', CR, LF, 0
   mov  a, b
   ...

The print function would pull the string off the stack, print it and adjust
the stack pointer before returning.  How would you determine the start of
data there and if you did how would you know where it ended?  If you are
lucky someone has already written what you want.  If not, this is not a
knock-off project by any means.

I would just add that a Z80 disassembler would see the 8085 SIM and RIM
instructions as Z80 instructions (which ones?  anybody?).  So, if the code
contained those instructions but no other Z80 instructions, then it would
be 8085 code.

There's a trick I SORTA remember which uses the Z80's additional overflow
capability of the parity flag.  I can't remember the specifics, but 
trying this on an 8080/8085 and a Z80 will yield different results.
 
 MVI A,80H
 SUI 81H        ;; force an overflow
 JPO WHATEVER

If I remember correctly, the parity flag will be set on one and clear on
the other, but I cannot remember offhand which one it is.

Just thought I'd summarize for any others having problems: it appears that
reading 40 track disks in HD disk drives can give problems. Of course, my CP/M
machines have ~10-year old drives, so alignment is not perfect anyway. Using a
HD mechanism makes it even more critical. The solutions that worked for me:
- use a new(er) version of 22dsk. It supports ATs these days. - use normal
360k
drives, who needs these new-fangled HD things anyway :)

And, best of all:
- format the disks on the AT, then use these disks on the CP/M machines.
22disk
will have no problems reading the disks after that.

Thanks to all who helped!


Groeten,

           Oscar

doesn't have to do anything fancy - just let me copy files across to
my "ordinary" 170k A: drive.

2) (Probably a FAQ - if so, sorry) Does anyone have a full list of CPM
system calls .. I have the simpler ones like printing chars etc but
not anything more complex - please don't say RTFM..ever seen Amstrads
CPM documentation ? ... 144pages of license and 5pages about how to
put discs in the drives..:-)

Subject: Re: 8080/8085/Z80 Code Identifier
Message-ID: <9301241501.AA23431@LL.MIT.EDU>

John Winslade asked about determining if a given COM file included Z80 or
8085 code in addition to 8080 code.  A few people offered answers.  One was
the following:

>> There's a trick I SORTA remember which uses the Z80's additional overflow
>> capability of the parity flag.

   This is not the answer to the question at hand.  It is a method of
determining within a program what kind of processor it is actually running
on at the time.  It is often used in programs that require a Z80 to make
sure they are NOT running on just an 8080 so that they can abort gracefully
before they go up in flames.

   In fact, as one reply noted, it would be extremely difficult to determine
by any simple analysis what opcodes appear in a COM file, since there is no
easy way to discriminate between code and data.  However, there is a rather
nice way to find out if you have, of all things, a DOS machine with the
22NICE emulator.  If I remember correctly, it  can optionally be set up to
emulate only 8080 opcodes or to emulate the full Z80 set.  In the former
mode, it will trap Z80 opcodes as illegal.  This approach works because the
emulator actually tries to execute the program, and that distinguishes
between data and code.

   It would be possible to do the same thing under CP/M itself, namely, to
write an 8080/Z80 emulator (strange to emulate a processor on the very
processor that is being emulated!).  In fact, it may even be that the DSD
(Dynamic Screen Debugger) tool already does this (it certainly could be made
to do it), since it supports an emulation mode in which it does not actually
run the code (as DDT and SID do) but emulates (simulates) its operation
while allowing a user routine to evaluate whatever one wishes on each step
of the code.

   But it will only execute those parts of the program that are
   in the execution path for the data (or other) supplied for
   that run.  It may be that Z80 specific code only exists in
   parts of the program that are not executed in the conditions
   of the test.  eg Z80 code may exist in exception code.

   While this approach may definately say that some particular
   programs do have Z80 code, the reverse may not be true, it
   will not be possible to say that other programs do not have
   Z80 code.

The IX and IY registers are used in certain cases, the nmemonics are
generated with DEFB's, so that they pass through an 8080 assembler.

As I look at the pile of unused (unusable) 8" drives in one corner of 
my basement, I came up with a couple of questions

1) What do I need for the DIP style terminator resistors on Qume DataTrak8
   DSDS drive?

2) I have a couple of fancy 1/2 height NEC 8" drives that use DC power
   only. What is the pin out on the power plug? I't a little 4 or 5 
square pins in row connector, not the usual massive block style.

3) Does anyone have mods to a cheap PC floppy controller to let it read/write
   8" drives? I'm not interested in buying a new card, but have several
   extra XT and AT floppy controllers to experiment with.

Hi all!

Does anyone know if the Manx Software System inc still lives somewhere.
Perhaps they have an email address.
I bought their Cross compilers for MSDOS and CPM 6 months ago.
I tried to fax to their fax-no 9085428, but I have not received any answers.

My problem is anyhow related to converting doubles to floats.
This problem only occurs with the C80 compiler.

 (float) (double) 6.2000 --> 6.199(...)
 (float) (double) 1234.5678 --> 1234.566(...)
 (float) (double) 300.2 --> 300.1992(...)

Perhaps this has to do with the FLT80 assembler library.

Compiler versions is anyhow:
  Aztec C80 Pass1 v4.10b 10-3-88 (C) 1982-1988 by Manx Software Systems, Inc.
  Aztec C80 Pass2 v4.10b 1-11-90
  Aztec AS80 v4.10b 5-9-88

Richard Plinston added the following comment to my suggestion of using an
emulator to determine the presence or absence of Z80 opcodes in a given COM
file:

>> But it will only execute those parts of the program that are in the

>> of the program that are not executed ...

   This is true, and I, too, thought of that at the time I composed my
message.  However, I decided not to mention it, since it is highly, highly
unlikely -- though not impossible -- that only 8080 opcodes would be used in
the main program code while a Z80 opcode would be used in exception code.

   One could come up with with a program (using self-modifying code!) that
would appear to have only 8080 opcodes except under arbitarily specific
input conditions, and to that extent there is no way, in principle, to
determine with certainty from the COM file alone that it does not and can
not contain Z80 opcodes.  However, I do not think that this is what the
person who made the original posting was thinking about; his question was
much more practical than that, and I think the emulator approach would solve
his problem very nicely and easily.

hang 'em off your at if you have lots of8 inch disks to play with - an at
5.25 1.2MB floppy is simply a squished 8 inch drive, with one minor exception.

8 inch drives only support 77 tracks, instead of 80 (at least the ones i have
used in the past only use 77 - shugart 801, for example).  These drives may
handle 80 tracks if you try to format them that way.  if not, then try the
/t and /n switches to override format's default settings.

the at 1.2MB drives actually changes spindle speed and transfer rate to the
same values as the old 8 inch drive double density charactistics when in
high density mode.  you might have to build a funny cable to go from 34 pin to
50 pin, but in general you should be able to use the 8 inch drive in place of
a regular 1.2 HD drive

good luck!

   I don't have a definitive answer yet, but I can give a tentative YES. 
Actually, some of us were debating whether we should have ONLY the Z Fest
and skip the connection with the Trenton program.  It looks now as though we
will probably be going with the same format as last year -- and probably the
same venue for the Z Fest.  Only the purveyor of pizzas will definitely be
changed!  (Having pizzas delivered one at a time every ten minutes for about
fifty people was not generally judged to be very satisfactory.)

   We do not yet have anyone who has volunteered to take responsibility for
making the local arrangements.  Lee Bradley did an excellent job of paving
the way last year, but he doesn't want a second term.  Also, I have not yet
reserved a room with the Trenton organizers.  The official deadline has
passed, but it is probably still possible to get our room and get listed on
the program.  I have had major deadlines here at work that have made it
impossible for me to give any serious thought to Trenton.

Im having trouble with the RIGHT drive. Some times when I fire this thing up the drive will work perfect, other times it will read/log onto it once, other times it will not work at all. Any segestions!!!

2) I have a MS-DOS operating system disk that does not come up with any type of a listing but there is something on the disk. Is this the disk to get the QX-10 to operate in the MS-DOS system!!!

3) there is a program on the CP/M Boot disk thats called QXPC.COM. When I run this program it locks up the computer and has a "Testing QX-PC" message. There is anouther QX program that asks if I would like to install QX-PC on the hard disk. I answered "YES" and nothing happened. I ran it again and a Warning Came up stating that QX-PC was installed. Whats going on!!!!

4) Where can I get a full set of documentation for the EPSON QX-10 all I have is a few reference book.

I would appriceate any information I can get.

Hi,

I am trying to get hold of the CP/M 2.2 Alteration Guide as referred to
in the CP/M 2.2 Manual. This guide apparently details how to configure
the partial BIOS of an unconfigured version of CP/M to the specific hardware
on which CP/M is going to be run.

I am also interested in the Alteration Guide for CP/M 3.0.

I have tried contacting Digital Research UK with the aim of obtaining this
documentation (and an unconfigured version of CP/M) but unfortunately DR UK
do not hold any CP/M stock at all, and do not have any archives according to
the representative to whom I spoke.

I have written to DR US, but have not had a reply yet. I was hoping that
someone in this newsgroup could help!

Replys via this news group or directly to mwestern@ihlpx.att.com would be
very gratefully received.

Thanks

	Can't help with 1 and 2, but the AT 1.2 Mbyte format is
	supposed to be hardware and software compatible with the
	8" drive double sided double density format.  Haven't
	actually hooked one up myself, but I'd be interested to
	know what results you get.  Note that the cable is not the
	same, so you have to figure out an adapter.

I recently had this problem, and it turned out to be the drive cable
to motherboard IDC connector.  But a number of different connectors
and indeed problems with the drives themselves would give this effect.
In the end I made up a set of extension cables so I could run the 
machine dismantled, and swapped cables until the fault went away.
Then I attacked the duff cable.

You have the software, but not (probably) the hardware for the TITAN
QX-PC MSDOS Coprocessor Board, which may still be available.  It costs
around $400 and is almost useless.  I use mine as a 500KB ramdisk under
CP/M, where it is marginally effective.  (Needless to say, it was in the
machine when I got it).  Check the slots to see you haven't got the board
installed, and then ditch the software.

I don't know where you can get documentation now Snyderscope has folded.
I find odds and ends at swapmeets, but that's about all.

Hope this helps - Will

   CP/M stands for "Control Program/Monitor."
       - Osborne 1 User's Reference Guide, REV: 2/22/82, page 48
   Another book I have says it's Control Program for Microcomputers.
   My copies of DR books supplied with an early Kaypro are packed 
   away so I don't know what DR says.

Thom Hogan says that it stands for "Control Program/Monitor", and the 
first line of the DR manual is "CP/M is a monitor control program for 
microcomputer system development..." so he's probably right.

Subject: How to convert a MP/M tape to UNIX?
Message-ID: <1029327.57214.7610@kcbbs.gen.nz>

    >>> it was written using the "savestr" on MP/M

    It is likely that the tape is a simple block stream of the
    disc partition.  That is, it is a series of blocks in the
    same order that they appear on the disc from where they
    come.  Somewhere at the start of the tape will be the directory
    entries then the data blocks as found.  Each file will not be
    contiguous but will be scattered throughout the tape identifiable
    only by following the directory entries.

    A restore of the tape to a suitable disc using appropriate s/w
    would be required.

    Of course I may be entirely wrong.

    cheers

I need a good terminal emulator that will support the vt series of terminals
for a Kaypro 2 running CP/M.  If anyone has such a beast or knows of where
I could get it I would be very grateful.  I thought I should put the machine
to some good use.  Thanks

I'm looking for a product called MSPRO from Computer House which
allows MSDOS to be run on a CompuPro 8/16 computer. The product
consists of a boot PROM (for a Disk1A) and a system disk (8 inch).
If anyone has one of these that they would like to get rid of,
please get in touch with me.

Thanks.

If you can find a copy, pick up The Programmer's CP/M Handbook, by Andy
Johnson-Laird (Osborn/McGraw Hill, ISBN 0-88134-103-7).  It's an excellent
reference on the subject, having two chapters devoted to writing a BIOS with
a lot of programming examples.

In case you haven't heard, DR US was recently bought out by Novell, so I
suspect that they are in a pretty serious state of transition right now.

Back in 1980, when I was still in school I was told CP/M stands for
Control Program for Microprocessors, and the CP/M books I have over here
say the same thing.  (Don't tell me CP/M has become so ancient that no
one even knows what the letters stand for!)  :)

According to The CP/M Bible (Waite & Angermeyer, H.W. Sams & Co) it means
"Control Program for Microprocessors".  DR, in their official manual, does
not explain the acronym.

Subject: Televideo TS 803
Message-ID: <1k81ctINNgvt@life.ai.mit.edu>

Two days ago I was given a Televideo TS 803 with boot disk and some other
software.  I already really like the machine, due to its graphics capability
and not one, but two serial ports, and I've broken the barrier of transfers
to and from it, but I've also come up with some questions that the user's
manual doesn't answer.

What is an STI?  I haven't found an overlay for MEX or ZMP for this machine
and the reason seems to be this STI.  I gather it somehow replaces the Z80
CTC, but none of my data books lists something called an STI.

The manual mentions expandability to 128K and there is, indeed, a row of
extra memory sockets, but no mention is made as to the method of using
this extra memory.  (I have the chips to plug in if there is some kind of
built in bank switching and I find out how to use it.)

There is a 40 pin header on the circuit board labeled "HARD DISK".  Is
this for a piggyback controller, or will the machine directly support
the appropriate hard disk?  (I strongly suspect the former, but I have to
ask anyway.)  :)

Answers to any of these questions, or any suplimentary info on the TS 803
will be most welcome.
