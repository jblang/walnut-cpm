Can anyone tell me if/how I can put a 10 or 20M hard drive on a Kaypro II?  Is
there a (relatively) inexpensive way to do this? I can probably find a cheap
(used) PC hard drive, but I'm sure that the CP/M / MessyDOS controllers are
incompatible...

You're mistaken there, if the Kaypro in question has a TurboROM
(as I've heard).  All that it need to have is an ST-506
interface, and you have to do a little of jumpering (the only one
I can think of is drive select) and let your formatting/BIOS
software take their respective courses.  I know a few friends who
have donw just what you've described ("PC drives"?  They're all
the same.  In fact, the two Quantum Q540's on my PC came the
other direction; from a pair of CP/M-type machines (actually
Concurrent DOS, no relation to the MeSsy variety))

> Eiffel: Accept no substitutes

In this case, there is no such thing as a "substitute" for there
is no such thing as a "CP/M drive" and a "PC drive".  As long as
they speak MFM through an ST-506 controller, you'll be fine
(provided you have the right firm-/software).

I have been reading this newsgroup for a couple of weeks now,
and I am surprised at the level of knowledge shown here! I
have acquired 2 CP/M systems, and I now currently use a Xerox
820-II system, with 2 8" floppy drives. Here's my question,
and please everyone, keep the answers SIMPLE, as I have NO
previous computer experience (which is why people gave me the
cp/m systems, I believe) and I also don't seem to be very
smart about learning computers, either. Anyway, I also have
2 other, functional, 8" floppy drives in a metal tray, which
I would like to have hooked up to the currently functioning
cpu, so that I have a 4-drive system, AND so that the system
know that it has 4 drives accessible (c&d drives?) BTW, I
also have another cpu for the xerox that I can put the working
floppy drives in, if necessary. I have no idea if this is 
possible, but it sems to me logical that one should be able to
have a functional 4-drive system that knows itself, at least
from what I've been reading here recently. Any (simple) ideas?
Help!

Check out Emerald in Oregon.  They carry the "Compaticard" which is a PC
compatible disk controller.  I don't have one, but they appear to handle
8" drives on a PC, although I believe the ads say that the AT will not
boot from an 8" drive (that may not be a big deal!).  They are not cheap,
but seem to answer your needs.

Subject: SIMTEL20 disk space
Message-ID: <WANCHO.12642998015.BABYL@WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL>

Due to a scheduling problem for the construction of the required room
expansion to house the recently procured disk drives, there will be an
unexpected three-to-four-month delay in the installation of the
drives.  This delay prompted some drastic action to make more long
overdue disk space available to the ever-growing collections on
SIMTEL20 after more than two years of managing saturated capacity.

After consultation with our advisors, the PC/Blue collection was taken
offline, to be restored when the new drives are online, together with
nearly 100 new volumes currently waiting for disk space to become
available.  This decision was based on the fact that the existing
MSDOS and MSDOS2 collections represent a majority of the same files
contained in the PC/Blue collection and are generally newer versions
(without the overhead of keeping older versions, due to the release
scheme used by the PC/Blue Librarian).

Because of the disproportionate amount of space freed up by removing
the PC/Blue collection from PD1: (about half the capacity of PD1:),
several collections were moved from PD2: and PD3: to PD1:, and from
PD3: to PD2::

    PD2:<MSDOS2*>     ->  PD1:  (the subdirs will be moved to PD1:<MSDOS>
    PD3:<HZ100>       ->  PD1:
    PD3:<MISC*>       ->  PD1:

    PD3:<CPMUG>       ->  PD2:
    PD3:<ZSYS*>       ->  PD2:

Now, all MSDOS and related collections are on PD1: and all CP/M and
related collections are together on PD2:.  The Unix-C and Ada
collections will compete for the remain space on PD2:, while the
Macintosh collection will compete for space on PD3: with the system
support and documentation files.  Note: PD3: also contains a mirror of
the corresponding collections from NIC.DDN.MIL, namely all RFCs in
RFC:, most of the NETINFO: files, all DDN-NEWS: files.

We hope this temporary inconvenience will be offset by the value and
availability of many new current releases we have been unable to
provide until now.

You can use the "Xerox" method of daisy chaining; this is pretty much
built into your system and would just require attaching the extra 8"
Shugart unit up to the back of your current drives and setting the
approproate swicthes on the controller card (I think!).

Other than that, I'm not sure what you might do to add drives to the
system, but I'm sure its possible.  You might try calling Mitch
Mlinar's BBS in Torrance, CA for information, or if you can't reach
it leave me a message and I will help you track down some software.

Z3PLUS  looks very interesting.  I am considering purchasing it, but I
don't know that I can afford it at the moment.

 Here's the vendor of the harddisk used by more than 50 people with great 
 pleasure: Dobbertin Elektronik GmbH, Brahmsstr. 4, D-6835 Bruehl, Germany
 Tel. 06202 / 71417   They also provide a patch for the silicon disk operation
 ROM, since there is a hardware error (slight) in the device itself.
He wanted to know the price. In Germany, the price is 1100.-- DM including
14 \% VAT. This is normally not included in export business. So the VAT rate
of your own country has to be added here on top of the net price. Also, one
should consider shipping cost and customs. This means, that a collective order
will help to bring down freight expenses. 

So for those interested in more info, here the FAX number of DOBBERTIN GMBlpH
06202 75509 (I hope this is correct, check carrier tone!) 

Referring to sending P.D. empty disks:
Should I send disks which
are designed for 360K (IBM style) or 1.2M (IBM style)?   My
thought is the first, because I have formatted them to 800K before
without problems.  There are sometimes problems with the others.
Please only use standard disks. I do prefer 1.2 MB, this will be approximately
20 Disks. 

Again: Yes- this is the right address!

Thank you for the offer.  I will gather together the necessary

There is an overlay for NightOwl Softwares MEX communication software for the
Dynabyte DB 8/1.  The overlay is designated MXO-DB10.ASM, and should be on
many BBS that handle CP/M stuff along with the PD MEX114.LBR package.  If the
overlay is not directly applicable, it should at least be similar.

Thanks to the help of some fine netters I just got my
hand on a copy of INTTERM, an interrupt driven terminal
program for a Kaypro.  But unfortunately it
doesn't work on my Kaypro.  Apparently it works on
other systems.  From looking at the code there are a 
couple of questions I have.

1.  Why is it necessary to wait for the disk drive
    to deselect?

2.  Why does it relocate handlers into different areas
    of memory and could this possibly be stomping on
    something.  

3.  Does anyone have a memory layout and tech. info for
    the KPII-84 that they would send me?

Any help and info will be greatly appreciated.

   i use imp245 (of irv hoff fame) and at 2400 baud it loses the third char
of every line on my II/83.
 
   i imagine this is due to the screen handling routines in ROM, as it
apparently takes more time to handle a carriage return than it does to
put a char on the screen.
 
   the best solution would be to use a lower baud rate until you can either
increase the processor speed or install a rom that handles the screen
quicker.  at 2400 baud, i have no problems when i configure the host system
to insert 3 nulls after every carriage return.  at 9600 baud you'd probably
need 40 or 50 of them.

Chuckle, more likely because the CP/M systems were cheap.  Both my mother and
sister-in-law do a lot of word processing.  I set them both up with Xerox
820-II computers (which cost very little) and both of them are quite happy.

It *IS* possible to convert the 820-II to use four drives instead of two ....
but it's going to take a lot of work.  Your going to have to rewrite the BIOS.
..... And even then, I'm not sure the extra two drive select lines are on the
Floppy controller board (I'd have to take a look).

If you decide to go this route, describe to me what you have, and I'll tell you
how to put it together.  It sound like you might have some non-standard
(home-built?) equipment.

  Wacky Willy's at 11th and Stark have a pair of them, both brand new.  I
don't think they do any mail order business, but even then if you look in
the right places you should find similar deals.  at Electronic Supply
Corporation in seattle (Latona ave and 45th street) a couple years ago
i bought a pair of shurgart sa860 drives for $25 apiece, so the
deals are out there.
 
  if you are referring to jb technologies, don't ever buy an item like that
from them.  in fact, if you can help it, never buy an 8 inch drive mail
order, especially hard drives.  insist on seeing the drive (preferably in 
operating, if possible) before laying down cash.  it's very rare to find
new, unused 8 inch drives these days, and finding the media can be even
harder.  (that is, finding it at a resonable price.)  for one thing, 8 inch
drives weight quite a bit, and are quite fragile.  you'll pay more for
shipping and may get a drive that's out of alignment or not working.
and you can bet, if you file a claim with ups for damages, you won't get
much back, even if you point out how much you paid.

  well, what i meant was could i connect my 8 inch drives to an existing
AT HD controller and get the thing to work with uniform??  the reason
why is because compaticards aren't exactly cheap, and i'd like to
avoid that step if possible.  i can make a proper cable, but i need to
know if uniform understands such a setup.

   ok, mine has one serial port, and no graphics or attributes.  also,

the kaypro claimed it was a single sided floppy, so apparently it has
single sided drives.   would i need to change the bios to add double

Open the box and check the monitor ROM.  If it is 81-232-A, you have a later
II/83 which shares the same board with the 4/83 and DSDD should be no problem.
If it is 81-149-C, I don't know.  However, all three used the same CP/M 2.2F.

Sorry to take exception with this. I don't think it is the applications
programmers responsibility to guard against all manner of stupidity on the
part of those writing systems code. Believe me, every modern OS puts the
burden of saving and restoring machine state on the OS -- on a Unix system
a system call is commonly implemented by a TRAP or INT, and the first thing
the OS will do is save all the registers and whatever else is involved with
the user context so it can restore it transparently.  As you point out there
is no possible way that user code can "guard against" what is done with
registers in interrupt routines since they are completely asynchronous.

The sad reality of things though is that you are right in a way,
due to the abundance of funky systems software in the CPM realm.
In the hey-day of CPM every Tom, Dick, and Harry was in a rush to port CPM
to this or that platform, and some of the work was poorly done.
This forces you and I to go to lengths we shouldn't have to, if we really
want "portability" to every sleaze-ball system.  However if the above 
guidelines for SYSTEMS code were followed, we would not have to do this.
Another case could be made perhaps for efficiency, the applications
programmer knows at any time exactly what he needs to save, whereas a
systems call handler must necessarily save everything to be general.
In the Z80 realm where every machine cycle is precious, this might have
merit, but I would rather save the code space (and my keystrokes :-) ).

That only works if you have the 8" hard drive, which by the way, has only one floppy.

I read this article on Thursday, November 29. The next day I tucked my
Kaypro under my arm, grabed a hard disk with my other hand, and payed
Emerald Microware a visit. On the following Tuesday, I picked up my
machine with a new (to me) 20 meg hard drive.  That's what I call
service.

The price was $245 for the kit and $100 to install it. Emerald Microware
really knows Kaypros and CP/M.

Thanks for the tip Don.

[saga on why INITTERM doesn't work on his Kaypro]

     If you don't, your drives will stay selected forever.  The Kaypro
BIOS has a test loop in the character I/O routines.  If you haven't
talked to the drives by the time the counter gets to zero, it
deselects and turns off the motors.  When you run INTTERM, you are no
longer using the BIOS, so your drives stay selected.  This would be a
real problem on the K10, where your HD would stay selected forever.

     It moves itself above 8000h because it needs the ROM in order to
talk to the screen.  The ROM comes in at 0h-8000h.  If an interrupt
occurred while the program had the ROM enabled, the interrupt vector
would point to a random location in the ROM, not in the program.
Result:  BLOOOIE!

What I meant to imply is that the CompatiCard is essentially a 4-drive AT FDC.
Therefore, it should be possible to connect to a regular AT FDC.  Try it, all
it should cost you would be the effort to make the cable.  As to UniForm
understanding it as an 8", I doubt it.  But it should write to it in 1.2
format.  Look into the capabilities of Driver.sys, though.

     No, you don't need to change the BIOS, but you DO need to:

	a) add double sided drives
        b) add one jumper to enable the side select line on the
           interface

     The Kaypro as sold cannot deal with 8" drives. The data transfer
rate over the interface is twice as fast as your 5" drives.  This goes
for the AT drives, too.  This is why you need a new controller when
you add a 1.2 or 1.44 Mb drive to a PC.

    You don't upgrade it.

     You've already done the test.  You only have 1 serial port,
therefore you have an '83 series machine.  Since it's only got SSDD
drives, probabilities are REAL high that you do, indeed, have a 2-83
motherboard.

     To tell for sure, look closely at your motherboard.  The original
2-83 had motherboard 81-110.  The 4-83 had motheboard 81-240.  They
are basically the same motherboard except for some jumpers.

Message-ID: <1990Dec7.015508.8635@massey.ac.nz>

Hi
A friend of mine has recently purchased a NORTHSTAR cpm machine on
which he wants to run either CP/M 3 or CP/M+ which he already owns
but for another brand of CPM machine.  To do this he needs a copy of
the custom BIOS for the Northstar for CP/M.  

Can anyone help out, in any way?

I hope this makes sense - my background was with M6809 and Flex so all
I know of CPM machines is that they preceded the PC :-)  The above is
a transciption of what I wrote on the back of a punched card during
his telephone call.

Any help would be appreciated - it seems a pity to let  perfectly
good hardware die ...

Thanks
Giovanni

I wrote a number of overlays for a few other comm programs for
the Dynabyte, like ZMP (my personal favorite) and Qterm and UUCP
(these two I am a beta tester for and I run a UUCP site with it,
namely ijsys (reachable via
...!ames!pacbell!sactoh0!ijsys!ianj)), and will continue to
write.  I'm debating whether I ought to write one for IMP, and
I've been thinking of overhauling the MEX overlay because it
doesn't support anything over 1200 baud.

He may need an .LBR extractor, or it might be better to send the
source (if any) straight to him because I don't think he has a
LBR extractor for his Dynabyte.  Or better yet, if he has a DOS
box (or access to one), send him one for DOS.

I've also talked to the guy.  He doesn't have all that much for
it except what he already has.

I read this note on Thursday, November 29. The next day I grabed a hard
disk, stuck my Kaypro under my arm, and drove over to Emerald Microware.
The following Tuesday, I had a Kaypro with a 20 Meg hard disk. I sure
can't complain about the service.

The kit cost $245 and I payed them $100 to install it. I'm glad I let them
install it because he worried about things I would not have considered.
For example, if the hard disk is too close to the floppy, the motor current
on the floppy will cause soft errors on the hard drive.

Thanks for the tip, Don.

Also, in order for intterm to run on an '83 series Kaypro II or IV, it
has to relocate itself above where the video RAM gets bank switched in.
I believe that the video RAM is mapped in just above the ROM.  Jumping
into the middle of VRAM wouldn't be too healthy, either.  The '84's
use a 6845 video controller, and talk to it through the Z80 IO ports,
the video RAM is not memory mapped.  The '84's have all sorts of
snazzy video attributes, but their video is much slower than the '83's.

On the '83's, people have even bypassed the ROM and used the Z80 block
move instruction to update the screen to make it even faster (like a lot
of PC programs do).  Of course, this makes the programs non-portable.
On the '84's, it should be possible to talk to the 6845 directly to
speed things up.  The BackGrounder II screen driver for the '84's does
just this.  It redraws the Kaypro's screen faster than anything else
I've seen.

MicroCornucopia has a schematic and theory of operation for the '84's
(and '83's and the 10's also).  It's interesting to get even just to
read through and say: "Oh -- So THAT'S why it works that way!"
I'd give you MicroC's address if I had it here at work.  Email me
if you want to get it from them -- I'll get their address for you.

I've been wondering that myself, but I have an XT and I have an
SA851 busy doing nothing at the moment...  However, if that
bit fails, you might try 22DISK.  It has some text in there about
using 8" drives, and you can specify whether or not you're using
a CompatiCard to drive it.

I have had several requests for a list of the system disks available in

dynamic thing with new editions coming in aperiodically.  If you have
something that you think I should have, please e-mail me about it.
Likewise, if you need something that I do have, send e-mail also.

I will probably re-post this list every so often, unless I get flamed

It is necessary for UniForm to be 'advised' of the presence of a particular
drive in order for it to access it.  This is done in the AT's CMOS and/or in
the config.sys file - depending on the controller, etc.  In the case of
CompatiCard, there is the statement: device = ccdriver (followed by
appropriate hyroglyphics) that identifies the drive parameters.  It may well
be possible to accomplish the same thing using whatever driver your
HDC/FDC uses to identify attached floppies.  But, not having tried it, I don't
know for sure.  Hopefully some other reader does, and will share his wisdom
with us.

Why?  "Because CP/M is an **8080** operating system - thus it may only use
8080 registers."  I got this reply back from Digital Research back in '80
when I asked them about the Z/80 registers.

That's right, but the silly people who did the Osborne-1 roms didn't. 
Hence perfectly valid Z80 applications that ran on other folks' systems
would crash on the Osborne.

Exactly.

Yes, it would make an application even more bullet proof to have it save
all the Z80 registers [or don't use them :-)] before it called into
BDOS/BIOS, but folks who write BIOS software should preserve the Z80
registers to help maintain compatibility with "incorrect" software.

Hi Netlanders,

I've written a simple program to convert true Z280 mnenomics to Z80
so you can use your "old" Z80 assembler for assembling. If there's
interest on the net I'll post it (about 25k).

Message-ID: <7imuT1w163w@cynic.wimsey.bc.ca>

Hello all - I am disassembling a boot prom and need to know some Z80DMA 
and Z80DART stuff.  The DMA gets sent 08hex as one of the first 
instructions - then it's not used again by the prom.  The DART gets 
sent this sequence:
 
 18 01 00 03 C1 04 44 05 68 00  (the last 00 might be superfluous)
 
to initialise it, and then the command port is only used by the 
following bit of code.  
 
 
FiddleP1:
    XOR    A                ;zero A and reset flags
    OUT    (DARTAStat),A    ;send it out
    IN     A,(DARTAStat)    
    AND    1                ;mask on bit 0
    SCF                     ;set this in case it was set
    RET    Z                ;ret if the bit was not set
    OUT    (DARTAStat),A    ;SEE QUESTION TWO BELOW
    IN     A,(DARTAStat)
    AND    'p'              ;70H - mask bits 456

    IN     A,(DATRADat)
    LD     A,'0'            ;30H - load A without affecting flags
    OUT    (DARTAStat),A
    OR     A                
    RET
 
Question ONE:
 
What DOES the set of initialisation bytes do?
 
Question TWO:
 
What I need to know here are the meanings of the bits 0, 4, 5, and 6; 
what happens when the status register is loaded with the returned byte 
after it is masked with 0000 0001 binary; and what happnes when it is 
loaded with 030hex.
 
No, I don't have a manual/set of data sheets, nor does either of the 
libraries I tried.
 
Thanks in advance to anyone who can answer these questions for me...

Message-ID: <8487@mcshh.hanse.de>

Doug Braun writes about CP/M Benchmarks.
He's absolutely right: the problem is that there is no standard (not only C)
compiler for CP/M. So, for testing the machine itself, we should at least
take the most usual compiler around here. I guess, that is Turbo-Pascal 3.0.
Perhaps the MBasic-Interpreter (though a hack) could serve for this purpose,
too.
So, if we use a standard set of test routines (i.e. for integer and real
arithmetic, and for I/O on ramdisk/harddisk/floppy) and compile them with
exactly the same compiler (Turbo-3), the results should be comparable.
Although I use a Z280 too, I think it's not right to use modified compilers
for benchmarks (except when the compliers are exactly the same, and we
just want to compare some Z280 with each other).
In that means, I'm using such a benchmark (published in c't magazine some
years ago) for a long time. I might post the sources on the net, if there
is interest.

I have gotten some firmware source on a 8" CP/M floppy and want to decode
the filesystem.  I went to "Software, Etc." and at least the guys working
there had HEARD of CP/M...  The files I want can probably be extracted
just by sorting through the data sectors by hand, but I figure if I need
to do this once, I might just need to do it again, and would enjoy doing
it "right" anyway.

  perhaps i didn't make myself clear.  (entirely possible, since i'm human
and not perfect...)
 
  it's the fact that the compaticard is not cheap that causes me to post
the question in the first place.
 
  now, i know the hardware of an AT floppy controller will be able to control
an 8 inch drive.  that is understood without question, since it is basically
the same as the interface used with 8 inch drives.
 
  what i meant to ask was, "Does uniform know how to use the AT floppy
controller when it is connected to an 8 inch drive??"
 
  i have a space in my system's floppy storage system that is designed for
AT compatible HD disk drives, but what i want to know is if i were to
connect an 8 inch drive to it (with, of course, a cable that routes all
of the signals where they should go) can i expect uniform to be able to
work with this setup?  currently, i have a western digital WD1003-WA2
controller with both a st225 and a teac HD drive connected to it.  there
is room to connect another floppy drive to the controller (it supports
2 drives), and i'd like to put my 8 inch drive on that.
 
   i know a compaticard would solve the problem, but in my situation that
is not an alternative.

Of course, that is the safest way. But then, system behaviour is very
well specified (see below). So I especially wanted to emphasize the
responsibility of the application programmers (not to blame it all on
the system programmers!).

Sorry, but that's not logical. If one uses Z80 opcodes in an application, he
must be aware that at least the BIOS also uses these instructions.

Of course, in fact it doesn't matter *who* saves. Just that the system may
save registers which aren't used by the application at all.
As for the spec's: see below.

I wonder if anyone of you ever read the CP/M Programmers Guide. In this
(original DRI) document there is the clear specification. The CP/M-Plus
Programmers Guide (as I use CP/M-Plus) tells me on page 27:

	When a transient program makes a BDOS function call, the BDOS does
	not restore registers to their entry values before returning to the
	calling program. The responsiblity for saving and restoring any
	critical register values rests with the calling program.

So everyone who writes (or wants to write) applications programs should
please read the specifications before doing so.

Of course, that quotation doesn't mention Z80 registers. But if you think
logically and carefully look at the sentence, it is absolutely clear that
*every* register may be changed after returning from a system call.

BTW, even commercial programs may have bugs: In Turbo-Pascal 3.0, the IX
and IY registers aren't saved before calling the Console Input routine, but
used afterwards. So be careful. (every other Char I/O is ok!)

	Greetings. I have great news! I went out a got a fully
	functional Kaypro 10! WITH all the manuals and most
	disks. ALL FOR $10 (even includes zipped velcro case)!


	Anyways, I still would like to get some stuff for the 
	Osborne, but if anyone out there want's one of mine,
	it's $50 plus you pay shipping. No docs or disks but
	I might make copies if I get some for my other O1.


	I have a feeling that the Kaypro 10 is better than my //e :-(

	It's nice to have a 10MB drive (true, it's slow. Can I just
	slip in a 40MB and take advantage of the decreased access time?
	even if I still get 10MB...)

	It has WordStar, lots of games, Superterm, etc. installed
	on drive B0: (I'll have to read about it later) and comes
	with a 5+1/4" floppy. Quite nice. Has a parallel, serial and
	a modem port so I don't need cards, like in my Apple...

	Anyways, as for the O1, it's definitely going to be a 
	security system and I'll use the K10 as a "toy" (read:MAC).

	Take care.

	P.S. Is the little fan supposed to be on all the time or just
	when it gets too hot? Also, the POWER led does not light, but
	everything works....

	Greetings. I got 2 Kaypro 10's. I turn one of them on,
	nice menu appears, I can use any software I choose,
	play games, etc.

	I turn the other on and the hard disk refuses to boot
	up... no matter what I do. I put in a system disk, get
	the A0> prompt, type "dir b:", light goes on, head
	unparks, I get a "BDos err on B: Bad Sector", same
	for drive C:....

	But, interestingly, if I wait for the head to park (not
	sure if this is normal - it makes a funny sound), and
	hit spacebar, I can sometimes get a whole directory
	and only get an error on the last line... I can't run
	FINDBAD though :-)

	Also, it appears that I got the computer with its heads
	UNparked... head (gasp) crash? But why would it show
	me the directory sometimes (about 1 out of 60 times)


	Does anyone have/know of a program that will format
	and partition a new/old hardrive? FMTFLPY (sp?)
	does not work, neither does MFDISK...

	I gues I will need a WD-1002-WD0 controller card if the
	hard drive is ok, anyone have one - REAL CHEAP?

	I have other ST-212 hard drives at home so swapping one
	is no problem. I'm also handy with a soldering iron
	if anyone has any pointers. I don't want to put too
	much money into it because I have so many other micros
	(//+,//e,vic,c64,s100,sun,apollo,osborne,timex,vic20,
	and a pdp 11/73 (whew) :-) that I don't mind trashing
	this one (for parts) ;-)

	Also, my other system can not boot from the hard
	drive, but it did come with a statup disk. I can
	use the hard drive with no problems. One problem,
	to make a floppy, one needs to have A: and B: to
	be hard drives and C: to be the floppy, but if I
	have to boot with a floppy, IT gets the A: and
	B: and C: are hard drives. The GENFLPY program
	just barfs and exits with a configuration error.
	Anyone know a way around that? CONFIG does not
	seem to list it there. Yes, I did look on
	simtel and wuarchive... nothing useful. Besides,
	I can't download anything. 

	[this is getting long]

	Also, if I can prove that I have the manuals for
	a program, will they send me a copy of a disk so
	I can use?  (WordStar, for example?)

	
	Take care.

	P.S. I am/will archive all I get. Please e-mail,
	reading news is expen$ive... ;-)

I'm using WordStar on an Osborne 1 along with Kermit, trying to program
a microcomputer board I built using BASIC-52 (Intel).

Files created with WordStar must contain some binary characters, which is
ruining the "raw" upload of program code to the uC board.

I need a real, flat ASCII file on disk- so is there easily available a
utility to massage WordStar output?

I suppose one could use PIP's Z option, and/or an MBASIC program- but I'll
bet this is a problem others have already beaten.  True?

        First, thanks to everyone who helped me with my earlier
questions on Otronas.  BTW, Mycroft appears to be defunct.

        I recently acquired an Otrona/IEEE-488 hard drive.
Unfortunately, the drive stops working after 10-15 minutes of
operation.  The problem appears to be in the controller card
in the external drive box.

        1.  Have any of you ever encountered a similar problem?
        2.  Does anyone have:
            a.  documentation for the Otrona HD?
            b.  an extra HD controller card (or an entire

            c.  an extra 128k/IEEE-488 board for sale?
            d.  a C-compiler for the Otrona?

well, CP/M itself doesn't use the special registers, but the BIOS might,
since that was supplied from the manufacturer of the machine.  there is 
another problem, though, in that some z-80 BIOS' were written in such way
that the index registers of the z-80 as well as the alternate register
set were used as temporary storage between calls, and applications that
used these registers would bomb on machines that expected those values
to still be there.
 
CP/M itself (for BDOS calls) doesn't preserve any registers.  (which led to
programs being littered with  PUSH B! PUSH D! PUSH H and corresponding
pops after each BDOS call)  perhaps it would be best to assume the bios
doesn't save the special registers in the z-80.   but an unacceptable
situation is where the BIOS requires the application to not change the 
value of those registers.
 
sure, CP/M is an 8080 operating system, but since most CP/M machines still
working these days are Z-80 based, then perhaps it should be considered a
z-80 operating system.  writing applications to run under z-80 CP/M should
be free to use those registers, but not expect the operating system to
preserve the contents.  (exception - interrupt handlers.)
 
people who own machines with a BIOS that does store values in special z80
registers would probably have to hack their BIOS so that it doesn't.  those
writing programs that use special z80 registers should PUSH them before
a BDOS call and POP them after the call, assuming they need to save the 
contents of those registers.

Two queries:

Does anyone have Dave Goodenough's UUCP suite of version later than
2.1a (9)? If so, could they mail me that they have it. I don't want them
to mail it to me - I would then get 3+ copies of it. (I pay by kilobyte).

What is the convention for the "true" file length byte in CPM Plus?
(It's set by setting flag f6' and putting the byte value in CR).
I assume it is the number of unused bytes in the last sector. Is this right?

On mine, it's due to having to scroll the screen contens up a line.  I've got
an 84 model or three,  and it keeps chars fine after a screen clear until
it hits line 25 and then begins to scroll and lose chars 3 to 6 of every
line.  Really annoying.  Got the uC Max Rom and it worked until I got a
Maestro 2400ZXR modem.  Now it's just as bad as before with 1200 baud!

I changed the 6845 too and it does make a difference, but not enough.  We're
gonna have to fix this one for good Guys!  Damn.

Hmmm...  I have NOT used word-scar in years, but I recall that if you use it
in "document mode" by selecting "open document file" on it's mail menu, it
will set the high order bits of the first (or was it the last) character in
wach string token (ie. word in a sentence.)  You can opt for opening your 
files in "non-document" mode and this will not happen, but you will see some
other differences like fixed tab sizes and so on.  I always used non-doc mode
when in word-scar when I was using it for this exact reason.  I think it is
safe to say that in non-doc mode, word-scar is like a full screen ed.

If you do not know what I am talking about, then either wordstar is not what it
was 10 years ago, or you have never run it w/o specifying a file name as the
file to edit.  Just run it w/o any perameters and you will get a menu that
includes "open doc file" and "open non-doc file".  I think there was also some
way to set it up so that non-doc was the default mode with some setup program
that it came with.

Hope that's it.

The thing to do (perhaps you know this) is to run wordstar in
non-document mode - then you read and write plain old ascii files and
all is well.  A contract I have made with myself is to NEVER type
the filename to be edited on the command line (wordstar is most commonly
installed to use document mode by default - putting all those nasty binary
chars in your file (and setting the 8th bit in some others as well
as part of it's way of "marking" up your file.)  Then type N and then type
your filename --- if you mistakenly start wordstar in document mode on
your 2999 line source file DON'T SAVE IT!!! use the abort and exit command
(whatever that is, I forget), and start over.  If you did save it .........
....... you poor guy ..... try the following recipe.

Just talked to my CPM guru nextdoor and he says to write a simple
filter that does this - 
Read the file byte by byte.
Force the high bit in every byte to zero on every byte read.
Delete every byte that is < 0x20 (blank) and that is
not 0x09, 0x0a, 0x0c, 0r 0x0d  (tab,newline,formfeed,return).

A code fragment in C would be something like this:
(this has not been tested, but this is the idea)

    while ( c = getchar() ) {
	c &= 0x7f;
	if ( c < 0x20 ) {
	    if ( c == 0x09 || c == 0x0a || c == 0x00c || c == 0x0d )
		putchar(c);
	} else
	    putchar(c);
    }

Subject: uniform and 8 inch cpm formats on AT controllers
Message-ID: <1990Dec12.101626.16284@techbook.com>

   well, after a little experimentation, it seems that uniform
DOES know how to massage an AT disk controller (HD) to produce
8 inch disk formats.   however, i do not know if the formats it
produces are readable on 8 inch machines.  all i did was install
my dsqd 5.25 inch drive as an 8 inch dsdd drive, and try the 8 inch
formats.   it does format the 5.25 inch drive as either 77 or 154
tracks (depending on single or double sided formats) and it can
read its own formats.   now, to find out for sure if you can use
an AT floppy port, I (or someone who has a spare floppy) will have to
wire up an 8 inch drive to the 5.25 inch controller and see if
it really does work.

i had a file around here that showed how to wire a HD drive to an
8 inch port, and imagine that i'll have to use the same cable
for the 8 inch drive to 5.25 inch controller.  problem is, it's
buried in a couple boxes of 8 inch cp/m disks and i don't relish
the thought of spelunking into that box to find it.  besides, since
there are probably other people on the net that want this information,
could someone be so kind as to post that file for us??

also, if anyone has any comments or suggestions concerning making a
cable for this, feel free to add to the discussion.  i'm going to
have to visit the library sometime later in the week and see what
signals on the interface will have to go where, and work from that,
but if someone knows it off of the top of their head, it would
save me a trip into downtown portland, something i also do not
relish.

and lastly, if someone does try this and get it working, please let
everyone else know of your success, and perhaps even post some
tips on getting it all to work.

but it looks like the hard part is over.  uniform does know how to
work a HD controller.

I have an SD-Systems setup, using their Versafloppy III (?) from back
before the flood.  This controller has a connector for 5 in. drives,
but I've been unsuccessful getting it to run an AT-style (dshd) drive.
Any suggestions welcome: is the connector the same for the hd drive as
for the dsdd model? Termination of cable req'd?  Jumpers somewhere?
Symptoms are that my FORMAT selects the drive and steps across it
(trying various formats originally intended for 5 in. drives), then
doesn't find the format when I look for the directory, use STAT, or
run DTYPE (a drive checking utility which looks at formats).  Any
suggestions welcome.  BTW, the card set originally came from JADE.
It has worked impeccably, except I had apparently a defective mapping
PROM, for which JADE sold me a replacement.  Thanks.  :=).

Even in non-document mode, WordStar will set the high bit of the character
the cursor is on at the time of the disk save.  It's entirely too nervous
for my application, unless the output is filtered through an external utility.

Now that is good advice-

too bad the original authors of WordStar were too brain-dead re:ascii files.
There's no reason they couldn't have built this code into the program- except
nobody's perfect; I guess they didn't think of it?  I dunno, except they do
massage the file for video display, just not to disk.  Not too bright.

   WordStar files created in DOCUMENT mode have many characters with the high
bit set, especially when justification has been turned on.  However, if you
create the document in NONDOCUMENT mode, then it should be a pure ASCII file,
or so I have always believed.

   There are utilities that will do this, but why don't you try using
WordStar's own nondocument mode?

The 1.2M floppy format uses the same data-transfer rate as an 8" drive
(500Kbits/sec). This is also true for 1.44M drives.

360K floppies use the standard 250Kbits/sec.

All IBM formats use MFM (Double-density).

CP/M uses FM (single density), and MFM.

RE: WordStar Utility

Try Irv Hoff's FILT7, which should be available on your local RCP/M
or SIMTEL20.  If all else fails, message me and I will send you a
copy.

FILT7 is pretty good, and has several options built into the program.
Its other upside is that it is fast and small (ie: it won't hog a chunk
of your disk space).

THere is a program called VDOEDIT (sp?) in Simtel that is a raw-text word
processor with WORDSTAR COMMANDS!!! (which I assume is the only reason why you'd
    want to hold on to WS despite its peculiarity).

In fact, the "binary" elements in the WOrdstar output can be removed,
I think, by "clearing" the MSB (bit 7) of each byte. Word star uses all
ASCII code for formating (unlike, say, WOrdPerfect), so getting rid of the end-
of-word markers would just do fine.

Hmmmm, time to play with WordStar again.  I have never had that happen to me

When I was still using my old WordStar on an 8080 S-100 CPM system, 
used Irv Hoff's "filt.com" program. It would strip all the high
order bits, etc and give you a plain ASCII file. It's probably 
available on CompuSee's CPM forum. (My version is probably buried
in the basemenon an 8" floppy....somewhere....maybe)

A similar program is available froStarFixer called FileFixer that
does a similar job for MSDOS WordStar afficionados.
Good Luck in your search.

Even in non-document mode, WordStar will set the high bit of the character
the cursor is on at the time of the disk save.  It's entirely too nervous
for my application, unless the output is filtered through an external utility.

Now that is good advice-

too bad the original authors of WordStar were too brain-dead re:ascii files.
There's no reason they couldn't have built this code into the program- except
nobody's perfect; I guess they didn't think of it?  I dunno, except they do
massage the file for video display, just not to disk.  Not too bright.

With WordStar 4.0 for CP/M, you have a couple of options.  You can force
it to open a file in non-document mode from the command line:

	ws filename.ext n

If you do accidently create a file in document mode, you can always use
good ol' pip to strip the high bits off:

	pip ascii.txt:=highbits.doc[z]

WordStar 4.0 can also strip the high bits.  Re-open the file in non-document
mode, then use ^B (I believe -- it might be ^^) to convert the file to an 
ascii file.  Use ^QQ^B, and then WordStar do its stuff.

Hmmm, I knew both of those, but what is the transfer rate for a quad density

Sorry if I'm wrong, I did not use WordStar for the last years.
Can't you guys strip off the high bits by printing to a file?  Worked fine
for me the last time I did it.
That's a lot easier than using utilities!

I have a single-sheet mailing from them from October 1988.  The only price
they show is a "special student discount price" of $29.95, plus $5 s/h.
This package includes the compiler (with 434-page book), a split-screen
editor and a windowing source-level debugger.  Unfortunately, only the
compiler is part of the CP/M version; the other goodies were developed for
MS-DOS (the sheet, in fact, is very much MS-DOS-oriented).  I don't
remember why they sent me the "educational package" price; it may be that
that had become their price for all customers.  Anyway, for more up-to-date
information (it's Sunday, so I can't do it), you can contact them at:

	Mix Software
	1132 Commerce Drive
	Richardson, TX 75081
	214-783-6001

By the way, they claim to support the full K&R standard, including bit
fields plus enums and structure assignments.  You may not want to use these
features yourself, but it's increasingly likely that you'll encounter them
in PD source.  Just yesterday I was burned by BDS C's refusal to allow
static assignment of character arrays.  This further complicated building
of sgrep from a C Users' Group diskette.  I *still* prefer BDS C to Aztec C
for stuff I need to run small and fast, though.

On the other hand, be sure that these advertised features are actually
in the *CP/M* version; many commercial vendors are simply selling older
versions, having ceased development years ago.  These often started as
"subset" compilers, and were done well before enums, etc. became popular.
Good luck.  

Oh yes, please post what you learn, particularly about the status of their 
CP/M support.

Hello everyone,
 
Some time ago someone on this newsgroup mentioned a C compiler by MIX Software
for cp/m.  Does anyone know if this compiler is still available?  As I recall,
the package was around $25US and included a book on C, does anyone have any
other details to share? Your assistance is appreciated.

                    ========================
                    ========================

Hello Lance, yes I'm the one with the MIX C compiler (CP/M 
version) for sale.  Yes, it includes and excellent C tutorial in 
the 430 page manual.  The price is $20.00 plus $5.00 for S&H (UPS 
ground in the continental US).  I will quote shipping charges to 
other areas.

The MIX C compiler is a full K & R implementation of the C 
language.  The system requirements are:
   CP/M-80 (2.0 or higher)
   55K memory
   2 disk drives (or HD)
   Z80 CPU

I can install the software on many UNIFORM supported 5.25", CP/M 
disk formats, but the only ones that I can test are TeleVideo and 
360K IBM formats.  If you can transfer the files from one of 
those, I suggest you order in that format.  I can also arrange 
for you to download the software from my BBS.  Feel free to send 
e-mail or call for additional information.  Take care.

What do you mean by "quad"?  I've heard it used several different
ways.  Quad meaning either the high density disks (1200k), or the
DD 96tpi.  If you're talking about the latter, it should be the
same rate as DSDD, 48tpi.

I have original, brand new, WordStar 3.3 for sale.  Software is 
on 8 inch diskette (Xerox) and it has a deluxe manual (with 3 
ring binder).  This software is registerable and upgradable, even 
to WordStar 6.0 (for DOS if you're so inclined).  I can transfer 
the WordStar to 5.25" diskette (TeleVideo CP/M or IBM format 
suggested) that is supported by UNIFORM, but those are the 2 that 
I can test.

The price is $30.00 plus $5.00 for S&H (UPS ground, anywhere in 
the continental US).  I can quote you shipping charges to other 
areas.  Thanks and take care.

Message-ID: <1949@beguine.UUCP>

Could someone help me out a bit.  I have found an old Device
called a CP/M Companion 2.2.  This is a small case with a handle
on it.  It has a disk drive and a small light on the front which
says "virtual disk" next to it.  It has three rs-232 type ports
on it labelled, parallel, modem/host, and terminal.

Do you know what this is and if it is worth while for meto
try to use it?  I have an Apple IIe.  I thought maybe the disk drive
might be useful or maybe some of the chips???   Any thoughts?

I would also consider selling it if someone wants it.

Please e-mail to    mdgoodma@crdec8.apgea.army.mil

or you may reply here.  But the e-mail address is preferred.

Thanks,

Sorry about the messed up quoting above, guys.  Still learning this 
editor.  
Anyway I ahve MIX C for CP/M and it IS K&R standard.  The split screen 
editor is a seperate package, which I also have.  The editor uses a lot 
of overlays, so it would be slow on a floppy; on a HD it's ok, on a 
ramdisk it would be great.  It's a very complete editor - you can 
redefine EVERYTHING, it does macros, it works on disk based files 
(there's another slowdown) and it comes quite well documented.
 
All this I got some (3?) years ago so it might not be available but if it 
is go for it.  The compiler has BIOS routines, a speedup optimizer, and a 
shrink optimizer, and a linker I think.  The tutorial is really good - 
you can learn C from it.

Subject: Wordstar and the high bit
Message-ID: <009414CF0E8414E0.000010C0@dcs.simpact.com>

Generally the first thing you need on a cpm/m machine is a comms program,
to dig around BBSs for old software - and the second thing is a filter to
strip the junk out of the capture buffers.  You can write it in any
language you like, but you will surely need it; quite often pip..[Z]
makes an acceptable substitute.

Wordstar obviously had this question come up too often, because they put
a 'print to ASCII file' output into CP/M 4.0, and into all subsequent
(MSDOS) versions.  If you are editing, not telecommunicating, and don't
want the stuff there in the first place, you can set a flag in Wordstar
so it comes up in the N mode as a default; then you can only do D editing
from the main menu.  Or use vde, which doesn't put junk in the file until
you tell it to.

I've never had Wordstar (3.0 or 3.3) set a bit in an N-edited file at the
cursor position; which version were you running?

The real problem is a file with a premature ^Z, so that nothing beyond that
point can be seen by an editor.  DDT is then the only cure.

Good luck, anyway - Will

Subject 1:     Ascii output from WStar

Using WordStar 3.3 or 3.0, I have no problems creating an ascii file -
even though I have not yet figured out the difference between document
and non-document mode.

I create files without justification, and don't use anything fancy such
as underscore or bold.  When it is time to save and up-load, I start
printing (even though I don't even have a printer yet).  One of the options
is "print to disk" - this allows me to enter a file-name and save the file.

This new file, when uploaded with Kermit, contains no control characters.

Subject 2:      Where can I get WordStar 4.0?

Now a question: I would like to upgrade to WordStar 4.0 (for CP/M 2.24d)
                I have an IMS (Industrial Micro Systems) machine with
                the 8 inch floppy disk drives (DD/SD).  Any used (and legal)
                copy with documentation for sale, or an address of a
                distributor with an idea of cost, would be much appreciated.

Some time ago there was a request for information/review of the various CP/M C
compilers.  I would like to see a posting of the various compilers with
their pros and cons.  I would be happy to collect this info and post a 
summary, but I suspect this has alread been done (maybe I missed it?).

I have used the Aztec compiler with complete satisfaction, MIX is a new one,
I have the BDS 1.50 compiler sitting on the shelf and have not yet given it
a try.  I have some projects up and coming where I will want to ROM the code,
any suggestions on whether Aztec or BDS would be better for this?  Actually
any hints on ROMing C code for a Z80 controller kind of project would be
happily accepted.

I believe what is refered to as quad-density is also known as a 720k drive,
(the nomenclature is a bit sloppy, quad density means different things in
different contexts) and indeed has a 250kb/s xfer rate - the density being
acheived by higher track density (96tpi instead of the usual 48tpi).

BTW, for you transfer rate trivia freaks, did you know that a floppy written
on a 360kb drive and later read on a 1.2M drive (AT, HD 5.25in) has a xfer
rate of 300kb/s since the 1.2M drive rotates at 360 rpm, but the 360kb drive
rotated at 300rpm - this in part explains why you can read 360kb floppies on
such drives, but may have trouble writing to them (the other part is probably
the slimmer heads on the 1.2M drive).

I always used to use this method. An alternative is to get the PD VDE 2.66
editor from Simtel20. With this, you can load up a file in document mode
and save it back in non-document mode with the high bits stripped. Frankly
after using VDE on CP/M I wouldn't go back to Wordstar 3 unless I absolutely
had to (e.g. for a large file which VDE can't handle).
 
However, the high-bit problem isn't the only one you need to get round to
produce a pure ASCII file from a WS document file.
 
 If you have used print control
codes (e.g ^A, ^S, ^T, ^B etc.) you will need to strip those out too. WS
3.3 will replace most of them by nothing in a  global replacement, but it
won't recognize ^S (underline) in replacement mode. WS 4 (at least the DOS
version) will. With VDE, you could write a macro to do it. Alternatively,
having stripped the high bits with PIP ..[Z], you would need to run the file
through a second filter to get rid of the control codes. The following bit
of MS-BASIC code gives an idea:
 
[Initialization]
ctrl%=""
FOR n= 1 to 9
ctrl%=ctrl%+chr%(n)
next
for n=11 to 12
ctrl%=ctrl%+chr%(n)
next
For n=14 to 25
ctrl%=ctrl%+chr%(n)
next
[leave chr%(10) and (13) in]
....
[processing the file]
(assumes that infile is no. 1, outfile no. 2)
 
while not eof(1)
 line input #1, a%
 for count=1 to len(ctrl%)
  x=instr(a%,mid%(ctrl%,count,1))
  while x >0
   mid%(a%,x,1)="":' [or " " if you're worried about zero bytes]
   x=instr(a%,mid%(ctrl%,count,1))
  wend
 next count
 print #2,a%
wend
 
My syntax may be a bit ropey, but this gives the general idea. Let's
have a C version, please.

a) The 08h for the DMA means: Port B is I/O and decrements.
   That seems to be not the whole initialization :-)

The DART status register is as follows:
bit 7 : break
bit 6 : not used
bit 5 : cts
bit 4 : ri
bit 3 : dcd
bit 2 : tx buffer empty
bit 1 : int. pending (ch. A only)
bit 0 : rx char available

Be aware that you need only two addresses per channel, so the addresses of
the status register and the command register are equal (see init part).
So sending 00 to that address resets the internal register pointer (so that
the next read-access will safely get the status register).
The second output does exactly the same, as the value in A will always be 00.
Outputting 30h to the command register means 'error reset'.

Hope this may help you.

I thought that 1.2M floppy drives had a speed select line that allowed the
speed to be switched between 300rpm and 360rpm.....O.K. here it is from an
article in "The Computer Journal" from issue 44, page 17:
 
         ... It [a 1.2meg drive] is an 80 track double-sided drive,
         that, when pin 2 is pulled low, increases its rotational
         speed to 360 rpm.  At the same time, the NEC 765 floppy
         controller doubles its data rate to 500K bits/sec, and writes
         15 sectors of 512 bytes/sector.
 
Since pin 2 is normally low, the drive ends up spinning at 360 rpm, unless
allowed to change in the controller hardware (a speed select latch??).

If that's so, is a value of zero in this place mean that the last block
contains 128 used bytes? The "unused bytes" scenario seems more natural...

Clarification anyone?

Ise Henin asked the question "Where can I get WordStar 4.0?"  I would 
recommend that he talk directly with Micropro.  When I bought the upgrade for
my Intertec Compustars, I had to get WS4 for my home Kaypro, and do an 
electronic transfer to the Intertecs.  I got Micropro's permission to do this
type of transfer.  They had WordStar 4.0 in stock on a series of systems, but
not mine.  I bought 2 copies, and did the electronic transfer, and have 4.0
working fine on my systems.

The number I have is 800-227-5609, extension 769.  They are located at:

		Micropro International Corporation
		33 San Pablo Avenue
		San Rafael, CA  94903

One and a half years ago, Micropro still was available to assist me in an 
installation problem.  That was super for an 'obsolete' operating system.  
Other software houses have not been anywhere as helpful with their stock 
answer 'We don't support CP/M any more', or 'CP/M, what's that?'

Other phone numbers for Micropro from the installation manual are

		415-499-8864
		415-499-5693 (for WordStar CP/M Edition)

With the KayPLUS ROM, I can run at a peak of 4800 baud.  I can't quite
remember, but I think that consecutive screen-clears will ultimately cause
a char to be dropped.

The uC ROM is no better than the Kaypro ROM regarding screen update speed.
In other words, it is not very good.  However, one should note that the
6845 setup on the Kaypro is a poor h/w job; the video s/w is stuck with
all the work and handshaking and timing -- no fun at all.  The uC and
Kaypro original s/w tried to compensate and ended up with an effective
but slower solution.

I already have a Wameco (sp?) digital readout type

"Quad density" is a mis-nomer.  It started many many years ago when someone
(I think it was Micropolis) was able to reduce the step positions reliably.
The first drives were 100 tpi (that's right), later to become 96 tpi so
that you could double step  96 tpi to read 48 tpi disks.

"Quad density" is an advertising gimmick that stuck.  It is nothing more
than double density with twice the tracks, erg "quad capacity" should have
been the name.  Transfer rate is the same 250K/bits/sec.   8" single
density is also this rate, only the DD use 500k, which was only about 15%
slower than first PC hard drives

Message-ID: <28972@usc>

Regarding the "length byte" in CP/M 3.0.

Checking my CP/M Plus manual, it is indeed the length in bytes (module 128).
Thus, a value of "00" means the sector is full.

In fact, that is the default because it is up to the application to set this
value.  There are FEW programs which worry or care about the length of the
last sector in CP/M since there was never this mechanism in CP/M 2.2 which
is still the mainstay (or clone-stay) of CP/M these days.

Unless you are strictly in CP/M+ land and ALL of your applications know it,
use of this byte is of no help.

The DR CP/M 3 manual says "This facility can identify THE LAST BYTE of 
the last record of the file."  Whether DR counts beginning at 0 or at 1 
is not stated.
 
However, the value is set to 0 when the file is created and has a zero 
length.  Maybe you have to look at the record count in this case to 
deduce what number DR starts with.

     It's an SIO.  According to Mostek's 1985 data book, the 3884 is
the version that has *TxCB and *RxCB bonded together.

     Any Z80 data book should have what you need.

IMHO that is a little silly.  My terminal program (runs in the
native mode of my CP/M machine) traps that.   I did this mostly
because the screen is bit-mapped (16K) and takes _ages_ to clear
(well, ages in processor time!).    Some of the BB systems I know
(Opus particularly) send 3 or 4 clear screen sequences. 
 
I would have thought that any reasonable bios/comms program would
have the same trap.

No. Not true.  I don't know of any BIOSes in Kaypro/Xerox land that
trap multiple screen clears.  COMM programs (by and large) do not know
the clear screen sequence for the local terminal or, if they do, do
not check for repeating sequences.

Otherwise, I agree that multiple sequential screen clears are goofy and
unnecessary.

Tom, 

   There was a version of PCfile that was written for CP/M.  The primary computer it was to run on, though, was OS-1.  It will work with the Kaypro, but the opening screens are all trash. The upshot is  that if  they ever convert to Ms-Dos, the can upgrade to a PC version and still use their old files.  E-Mail me if you can't find it.

   i'm having a problem installing the hard disk version of 
pickles and trout cp/m on my tandy 16b with 12 meg hard disk.

   after running the system configuration MENU, and selecting the
hard disk module and a proper hard disk table, i reboot the system
like i'm supposed to.   after a little bit of floppy disk grinding, 
the loader writes on the screen 'Load Error 99' and things come to
a halt.   the hard disk is functional since i ran xenix on it, and
i powered everything up in the proper sequence.  (hard disk first.)

   after repeated attempts, i still get the same message.  usually, 
when the loader complains with an error message, it's because there is
an essential file that is missing, but i seem to have all of the
files needed to install the system.  even when i disable the hard disk
by deselecting the hard disk module in the installation, the system
stills gives the same error message.  

   does anyone know what could be causing this problem??

Hello All --

I'm the proud (?) owner of some surplus Z80 boards that look like they
have connectors for the Apple bus on them.  There was no documentation
available, and I'm wondering if any of you Apple CP/Mers might be able
to help identify them.  They are marked "Advanced Logic Systems".  There
is a "Z80 Card" that is a Z80B and little else but some interface chips
and a small PROM/ROM(?).  It does not even have an on-board clock that I
can see.  Also I have a "CP/M Card" from the same vendor.  It is unpopulated,
but looks like it would have memory, a crystal, etc.  There are no component
values or IC id's on the silk screen.  Can somebody tell me if they are
useful, or if there is documentation available for them??

If the board has some DRAM, it's the ALR Z80 card. If no ram
of its own, it may be a clone of the Microsoft Z80 card. These
each require their own boot disks, but data disks are compatible
between the two systems. The ALR card supported some add-on cards
for extra memory , maybe even a version of CP/M Plus.

Message-ID: <1990Dec24.162439.6459@ccu.umanitoba.ca>

Hello net world. I recently found CP/M 86 for the IBM DisplayWriter.
It appears to function well and makes what was otherwise a word processor
into a real computer of sorts. In the setup.cmd program it has configurations
for communication ports which it can't detect. From this I presume the
DisplayWriter can have communucation ports but this unit doesn't. Any ideas
where I can find such a board? Hopefully they are standard RS232's. 
Also of course now we need software. Does anyone out there have anything
for CP/M 86 formatted to a DisplayWriter readable 8" disk. The stuff of
interest would be:
	some sort of database (dbase 2?)
	some sort of spreadsheet (supercalc?)
	programming languages (mbasic, pl/1, fortran, cbasic, pascal)
	communications program to go with serial board
 
maybe i'm working on the silly assumption that such stuff actually made
it to CP/M 86, but it seems to be a pretty good, fast OS. also, does
anyone have some technical specs on the DisplayWriter? We didn't get any
manuals with it.
 
						thanks and have a good holiday

I think that any old 8" SSSD CP/M disk will be readable by the thing.

I know that spreadsheets, programming languages, and communications
programs made it to CP/M-86. I've seen (but, alas, don't have) Microsoft's
MultiPlan, a C compiler or two, and I've got KERMIT for my Rainbow. The
old Turbo Pascal manual (you know, version 3.01A and before; when it was
good) has a section on CP/M-86. I wouldn't be surprised if you could still
get CP/M-86 Turbo from Borland; it was only a few years ago that I ordered
8" CP/M-80 Turbo from them.

Glad to hear you've got it running.

Subject: emulator for TeleVideo 1603

I have an old TeleVideo 1603 pc that I would like to use to access my
account at this university.  Unfortunately the mainframe expects to
see an IBM pc, a VT100, or three other rather obscure terminals when
I dial in.  Does anyone know of an emulator (IBM or VT100) that would
run on a 1603?  I have two communications packages that run under
CPM-86 on the TeleVideo: TeleAsync and Mite.  I have managed to log
on to my account with Mite (which I tell the mainframe is a VT100
terminal) but have problems with the screen not clearing.  Emulation
can be added to Mite, but I don't have any program docs to see what that
involves.  I'm not even sure if the company which marketed Mite is still
around.  Any information on Mite would also be greatly appreciated.

Thanks, in advance.

This is the WS that came with the Osborne 1- v 2.26.  It *does* funky things,
even in non-doc mode.  Trust me! :-)

I am most assuredly not hell-bent on WS, it's just what I have.  I can try
PIP [z], printing to disk, another editor, or a utility.  One of those ought
to do it!

I wish I'd said I knew about non-doc mode in my original letter- oh well.

 Aha! Some versions of WordStar supported direct write to screen

Osborne knew to highlight the current character.

Has anyone out there ever heard of an Omti Series 10 SASI controller?
I am looking for specs, manual, any info.
I have two of these, each mounted on 8-inch winchesters (Quantum Q2020).
I need enough info to write a new driver for these things.  In particular
I need the details for the format and the set drive parameters commands.
In particular, want to know if this thing will handle a Q2040.
Any help will really be appreciated - I have gone most of the way reverse
engineering the thing (drew the schematic, read out and disassembled the
microcode roms, you wouldn't believe it ... ). The closest thing I got to
getting help from the manufacturer was talking to an engineer on the phone
who said,
>Yes I remember working late nights on that one, it warms my heart to know

Anyhow, this thing works, so if someone out there has
any documentation it will warm MY heart to hear from you!

Probably his best shot is to find someone with a PC and UniForm-PC or 22Disk
who should be able to read them easily.  There is a Direct 1025 listed in
UniForm-PC, and likely in 22Disk, also.

Subject: emulator for TeleVideo 1603

Many thanks to David Fetrow and Bill Marcum for their suggestions
concerning possible ways to use a TeleVideo 1603 pc to log into the
mainframe at my university.

Further perusal of the help files reveals that it is possible to log
in in line mode.  Not really a very satisfactory solution.

A few weeks back I checked the kermserv at Columbia to see if there
was a version of Kermit for the TeleVideo.  The best I could find
was a CPM-86 version that might (???) run on the TeleVideo, or a
generic MS-DOS version that pokes along at 1200 bps.  Anyone know
of a version of Kermit that will run on a TeleVideo?  The IBM/MS-DOS
version I have seen does vt100 emulation.  I'm hopping that any
version of Kermit for the TeleVideo might be similarly configured.

Thanks.

No luck, Word Master still won't edit the file.  I don't have a lot of

You're mistaken there, if the Kaypro in question has a TurboROM
(as I've heard).  All that it need to have is an ST-506
interface, and you have to do a little of jumpering (the only one
I can think of is drive select) and let your formatting/BIOS
software take their respective courses.  I know a few friends who
have donw just what you've described ("PC drives"?  They're all
the same.  In fact, the two Quantum Q540's on my PC came the
other direction; from a pair of CP/M-type machines (actually
Concurrent DOS, no relation to the MeSsy variety))

> =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
> Eiffel: Accept no substitutes

In this case, there is no such thing as a "substitute" for there
is no such thing as a "CP/M drive" and a "PC drive".  As long as
they speak MFM through an ST-506 controller, you'll be fine
(provided you have the right firm-/software).

Hi friends of CP/M !

I am looking for some files of the BD Software C-Compiler, because a friend
of mine has a defective version of these files.

If you still have got this Compiler or a hint where to find them, so please
E-Mail me !

I have been reading this newsgroup for a couple of weeks now,
and I am surprised at the level of knowledge shown here! I
have acquired 2 CP/M systems, and I now currently use a Xerox
820-II system, with 2 8" floppy drives. Here's my question,
and please everyone, keep the answers SIMPLE, as I have NO
previous computer experience (which is why people gave me the
cp/m systems, I believe) and I also don't seem to be very
smart about learning computers, either. Anyway, I also have
2 other, functional, 8" floppy drives in a metal tray, which
I would like to have hooked up to the currently functioning
cpu, so that I have a 4-drive system, AND so that the system
know that it has 4 drives accessible (c&d drives?) BTW, I
also have another cpu for the xerox that I can put the working
floppy drives in, if necessary. I have no idea if this is 
possible, but it sems to me logical that one should be able to
have a functional 4-drive system that knows itself, at least
from what I've been reading here recently. Any (simple) ideas?
Help!

Check out Emerald in Oregon.  They carry the "Compaticard" which is a PC
compatible disk controller.  I don't have one, but they appear to handle
8" drives on a PC, although I believe the ads say that the AT will not
boot from an 8" drive (that may not be a big deal!).  They are not cheap,
but seem to answer your needs.

[Emerald advertises in a number of publications.  I've seen their ads in
Circuit Cellar Ink]

Message-ID: <WANCHO.12642998015.BABYL@WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL>

Due to a scheduling problem for the construction of the required room
expansion to house the recently procured disk drives, there will be an
unexpected three-to-four-month delay in the installation of the
drives.  This delay prompted some drastic action to make more long
overdue disk space available to the ever-growing collections on
SIMTEL20 after more than two years of managing saturated capacity.

After consultation with our advisors, the PC/Blue collection was taken
offline, to be restored when the new drives are online, together with
nearly 100 new volumes currently waiting for disk space to become
available.  This decision was based on the fact that the existing
MSDOS and MSDOS2 collections represent a majority of the same files
contained in the PC/Blue collection and are generally newer versions
(without the overhead of keeping older versions, due to the release
scheme used by the PC/Blue Librarian).

Because of the disproportionate amount of space freed up by removing
the PC/Blue collection from PD1: (about half the capacity of PD1:),
several collections were moved from PD2: and PD3: to PD1:, and from
PD3: to PD2::

    PD2:<MSDOS2*>     ->  PD1:  (the subdirs will be moved to PD1:<MSDOS>
    PD3:<HZ100>       ->  PD1:
    PD3:<MISC*>       ->  PD1:

    PD3:<CPMUG>       ->  PD2:
    PD3:<ZSYS*>       ->  PD2:

Now, all MSDOS and related collections are on PD1: and all CP/M and
related collections are together on PD2:.  The Unix-C and Ada
collections will compete for the remain space on PD2:, while the
Macintosh collection will compete for space on PD3: with the system
support and documentation files.  Note: PD3: also contains a mirror of
the corresponding collections from NIC.DDN.MIL, namely all RFCs in
RFC:, most of the NETINFO: files, all DDN-NEWS: files.

We hope this temporary inconvenience will be offset by the value and
availability of many new current releases we have been unable to
provide until now.

You can use the "Xerox" method of daisy chaining; this is pretty much
built into your system and would just require attaching the extra 8"
Shugart unit up to the back of your current drives and setting the
approproate swicthes on the controller card (I think!).

Other than that, I'm not sure what you might do to add drives to the
system, but I'm sure its possible.  You might try calling Mitch
Mlinar's BBS in Torrance, CA for information, or if you can't reach
it leave me a message and I will help you track down some software.

Z3PLUS  looks very interesting.  I am considering purchasing it, but I
don't know that I can afford it at the moment.

 Here's the vendor of the harddisk used by more than 50 people with great 
 pleasure: Dobbertin Elektronik GmbH, Brahmsstr. 4, D-6835 Bruehl, Germany
 Tel. 06202 / 71417   They also provide a patch for the silicon disk operation
 ROM, since there is a hardware error (slight) in the device itself.
He wanted to know the price. In Germany, the price is 1100.-- DM including
14 \% VAT. This is normally not included in export business. So the VAT rate
of your own country has to be added here on top of the net price. Also, one
should consider shipping cost and customs. This means, that a collective order
will help to bring down freight expenses. 

So for those interested in more info, here the FAX number of DOBBERTIN GMBlpH
06202 75509 (I hope this is correct, check carrier tone!) 

Referring to sending P.D. empty disks:
Should I send disks which
are designed for 360K (IBM style) or 1.2M (IBM style)?   My
thought is the first, because I have formatted them to 800K before
without problems.  There are sometimes problems with the others.
Please only use standard disks. I do prefer 1.2 MB, this will be approximately
20 Disks. 

Again: Yes- this is the right address!

Thank you for the offer.  I will gather together the necessary
disks, and send them off to you later this month.

There is an overlay for NightOwl Softwares MEX communication software for the
Dynabyte DB 8/1.  The overlay is designated MXO-DB10.ASM, and should be on
many BBS that handle CP/M stuff along with the PD MEX114.LBR package.  If the
overlay is not directly applicable, it should at least be similar.

If it would be useful, I can send you a uuencoded package called BOOTSTRP.LBR

Recently I acquired a CP/M system made by a company called Dynabyte,
this system is a Dynabyte model 5200; unfortunately, instead of using
standard format 8" disks, it uses 5-1/4" floppies which appear to use a
format which is incompatible with that of any other CP/M systems that I

communications, or file transfer, programs on any of the diskettes which

have TMS 5550 marked on them (if I recall correctly from when I had the
CPU card removed from the system).

Is there anyone out there who is familiar with this system, its UARTS,
or who has any ideas about how to get a communications and file transfer
program set up and running on this system?  Thanks in advance for any
information.

Thanks to the help of some fine netters I just got my
hand on a copy of INTTERM, an interrupt driven terminal
program for a Kaypro.  But unfortunately it
doesn't work on my Kaypro.  Apparently it works on
other systems.  From looking at the code there are a 
couple of questions I have.

1.  Why is it necessary to wait for the disk drive
    to deselect?

2.  Why does it relocate handlers into different areas
    of memory and could this possibly be stomping on
    something.  

3.  Does anyone have a memory layout and tech. info for
    the KPII-84 that they would send me?

Any help and info will be greatly appreciated.

   i use imp245 (of irv hoff fame) and at 2400 baud it loses the third char
of every line on my II/83.
 
   i imagine this is due to the screen handling routines in ROM, as it
apparently takes more time to handle a carriage return than it does to
put a char on the screen.
 
   the best solution would be to use a lower baud rate until you can either
increase the processor speed or install a rom that handles the screen
quicker.  at 2400 baud, i have no problems when i configure the host system
to insert 3 nulls after every carriage return.  at 9600 baud you'd probably
need 40 or 50 of them.

Chuckle, more likely because the CP/M systems were cheap.  Both my mother and

820-II computers (which cost very little) and both of them are quite happy.

It *IS* possible to convert the 820-II to use four drives instead of two ....
but it's going to take a lot of work.  Your going to have to rewrite the BIOS.
..... And even then, I'm not sure the extra two drive select lines are on the
Floppy controller board (I'd have to take a look).

If you decide to go this route, describe to me what you have, and I'll tell you
how to put it together.  It sound like you might have some non-standard

  Wacky Willy's at 11th and Stark have a pair of them, both brand new.  I
don't think they do any mail order business, but even then if you look in
the right places you should find similar deals.  at Electronic Supply
Corporation in seattle (Latona ave and 45th street) a couple years ago
i bought a pair of shurgart sa860 drives for $25 apiece, so the
deals are out there.
 
  if you are referring to jb technologies, don't ever buy an item like that
from them.  in fact, if you can help it, never buy an 8 inch drive mail
order, especially hard drives.  insist on seeing the drive (preferably in 
operating, if possible) before laying down cash.  it's very rare to find
new, unused 8 inch drives these days, and finding the media can be even
harder.  (that is, finding it at a resonable price.)  for one thing, 8 inch
drives weight quite a bit, and are quite fragile.  you'll pay more for
shipping and may get a drive that's out of alignment or not working.
and you can bet, if you file a claim with ups for damages, you won't get
much back, even if you point out how much you paid.

  well, what i meant was could i connect my 8 inch drives to an existing
AT HD controller and get the thing to work with uniform??  the reason
why is because compaticards aren't exactly cheap, and i'd like to
avoid that step if possible.  i can make a proper cable, but i need to

   ok, mine has one serial port, and no graphics or attributes.  also,
after formatting a double sided kaypro floppy on my AT with uniform,
the kaypro claimed it was a single sided floppy, so apparently it has
single sided drives.   would i need to change the bios to add double
sided drives??  (i'd like to put qd drives on it, or better yet, 1.2

   also, what is needed to upgrade the video to the 84 standard??
i use vde as a text editor, and it need reverse video to show

   also, how do you tell if the machine has a IV motherboard???  if
mine does, then i could probably get dsdd or qd drives to work

Open the box and check the monitor ROM.  If it is 81-232-A, you have a later
II/83 which shares the same board with the 4/83 and DSDD should be no problem.
If it is 81-149-C, I don't know.  However, all three used the same CP/M 2.2F.

Sorry to take exception with this. I don't think it is the applications
programmers responsibility to guard against all manner of stupidity on the
part of those writing systems code. Believe me, every modern OS puts the
burden of saving and restoring machine state on the OS -- on a Unix system
a system call is commonly implemented by a TRAP or INT, and the first thing
the OS will do is save all the registers and whatever else is involved with
the user context so it can restore it transparently.  As you point out there
is no possible way that user code can "guard against" what is done with
registers in interrupt routines since they are completely asynchronous.

The sad reality of things though is that you are right in a way,
due to the abundance of funky systems software in the CPM realm.
In the hey-day of CPM every Tom, Dick, and Harry was in a rush to port CPM
to this or that platform, and some of the work was poorly done.
This forces you and I to go to lengths we shouldn't have to, if we really
want "portability" to every sleaze-ball system.  However if the above 
guidelines for SYSTEMS code were followed, we would not have to do this.
Another case could be made perhaps for efficiency, the applications
programmer knows at any time exactly what he needs to save, whereas a
systems call handler must necessarily save everything to be general.
In the Z80 realm where every machine cycle is precious, this might have
merit, but I would rather save the code space (and my keystrokes :-) ).

That only works if you have the 8" hard drive, which by the way, has only one floppy.

I read this article on Thursday, November 29. The next day I tucked my
Kaypro under my arm, grabed a hard disk with my other hand, and payed
Emerald Microware a visit. On the following Tuesday, I picked up my
machine with a new (to me) 20 meg hard drive.  That's what I call
service.

The price was $245 for the kit and $100 to install it. Emerald Microware
really knows Kaypros and CP/M.

Thanks for the tip Don.

[saga on why INITTERM doesn't work on his Kaypro]

     If you don't, your drives will stay selected forever.  The Kaypro
BIOS has a test loop in the character I/O routines.  If you haven't
talked to the drives by the time the counter gets to zero, it
deselects and turns off the motors.  When you run INTTERM, you are no
longer using the BIOS, so your drives stay selected.  This would be a
real problem on the K10, where your HD would stay selected forever.

     It moves itself above 8000h because it needs the ROM in order to
talk to the screen.  The ROM comes in at 0h-8000h.  If an interrupt
occurred while the program had the ROM enabled, the interrupt vector
would point to a random location in the ROM, not in the program.
Result:  BLOOOIE!

What I meant to imply is that the CompatiCard is essentially a 4-drive AT FDC.
Therefore, it should be possible to connect to a regular AT FDC.  Try it, all
it should cost you would be the effort to make the cable.  As to UniForm
understanding it as an 8", I doubt it.  But it should write to it in 1.2
format.  Look into the capabilities of Driver.sys, though.

     No, you don't need to change the BIOS, but you DO need to:

	a) add double sided drives
        b) add one jumper to enable the side select line on the
           interface

     The Kaypro as sold cannot deal with 8" drives. The data transfer
rate over the interface is twice as fast as your 5" drives.  This goes
for the AT drives, too.  This is why you need a new controller when
you add a 1.2 or 1.44 Mb drive to a PC.

    You don't upgrade it.

     You've already done the test.  You only have 1 serial port,
therefore you have an '83 series machine.  Since it's only got SSDD
drives, probabilities are REAL high that you do, indeed, have a 2-83
motherboard.

     To tell for sure, look closely at your motherboard.  The original
2-83 had motherboard 81-110.  The 4-83 had motheboard 81-240.  They
are basically the same motherboard except for some jumpers.

Message-ID: <1990Dec7.015508.8635@massey.ac.nz>

Hi
A friend of mine has recently purchased a NORTHSTAR cpm machine on
which he wants to run either CP/M 3 or CP/M+ which he already owns
but for another brand of CPM machine.  To do this he needs a copy of
the custom BIOS for the Northstar for CP/M.  

Can anyone help out, in any way?

I hope this makes sense - my background was with M6809 and Flex so all
I know of CPM machines is that they preceded the PC :-)  The above is
a transciption of what I wrote on the back of a punched card during
his telephone call.

Any help would be appreciated - it seems a pity to let  perfectly
good hardware die ...

Thanks
Giovanni

I wrote a number of overlays for a few other comm programs for
the Dynabyte, like ZMP (my personal favorite) and Qterm and UUCP
(these two I am a beta tester for and I run a UUCP site with it,
namely ijsys (reachable via
...!ames!pacbell!sactoh0!ijsys!ianj)), and will continue to
write.  I'm debating whether I ought to write one for IMP, and
I've been thinking of overhauling the MEX overlay because it
doesn't support anything over 1200 baud.

He may need an .LBR extractor, or it might be better to send the
source (if any) straight to him because I don't think he has a
LBR extractor for his Dynabyte.  Or better yet, if he has a DOS
box (or access to one), send him one for DOS.

I've also talked to the guy.  He doesn't have all that much for
it except what he already has.

I read this note on Thursday, November 29. The next day I grabed a hard
disk, stuck my Kaypro under my arm, and drove over to Emerald Microware.
The following Tuesday, I had a Kaypro with a 20 Meg hard disk. I sure
can't complain about the service.

The kit cost $245 and I payed them $100 to install it. I'm glad I let them
install it because he worried about things I would not have considered.
For example, if the hard disk is too close to the floppy, the motor current
on the floppy will cause soft errors on the hard drive.

Thanks for the tip, Don.

Also, in order for intterm to run on an '83 series Kaypro II or IV, it
has to relocate itself above where the video RAM gets bank switched in.
I believe that the video RAM is mapped in just above the ROM.  Jumping
into the middle of VRAM wouldn't be too healthy, either.  The '84's
use a 6845 video controller, and talk to it through the Z80 IO ports,
the video RAM is not memory mapped.  The '84's have all sorts of
snazzy video attributes, but their video is much slower than the '83's.

On the '83's, people have even bypassed the ROM and used the Z80 block
move instruction to update the screen to make it even faster (like a lot
of PC programs do).  Of course, this makes the programs non-portable.
On the '84's, it should be possible to talk to the 6845 directly to
speed things up.  The BackGrounder II screen driver for the '84's does
just this.  It redraws the Kaypro's screen faster than anything else
I've seen.

MicroCornucopia has a schematic and theory of operation for the '84's
(and '83's and the 10's also).  It's interesting to get even just to
read through and say: "Oh -- So THAT'S why it works that way!"
I'd give you MicroC's address if I had it here at work.  Email me
if you want to get it from them -- I'll get their address for you.

I've been wondering that myself, but I have an XT and I have an
SA851 busy doing nothing at the moment...  However, if that
bit fails, you might try 22DISK.  It has some text in there about
using 8" drives, and you can specify whether or not you're using
a CompatiCard to drive it.

I have had several requests for a list of the system disks available in
the SDCS Dino-SIG archive that I keep.  Happily, the archive is a
dynamic thing with new editions coming in aperiodically.  If you have
something that you think I should have, please e-mail me about it.
Likewise, if you need something that I do have, send e-mail also.

I will probably re-post this list every so often, unless I get flamed
too much for excessive bandwidth.

It is necessary for UniForm to be 'advised' of the presence of a particular
drive in order for it to access it.  This is done in the AT's CMOS and/or in
the config.sys file - depending on the controller, etc.  In the case of
CompatiCard, there is the statement: device = ccdriver (followed by
appropriate hyroglyphics) that identifies the drive parameters.  It may well
be possible to accomplish the same thing using whatever driver your
HDC/FDC uses to identify attached floppies.  But, not having tried it, I don't
know for sure.  Hopefully some other reader does, and will share his wisdom
with us.

Why?  "Because CP/M is an **8080** operating system - thus it may only use
8080 registers."  I got this reply back from Digital Research back in '80
when I asked them about the Z/80 registers.

That's right, but the silly people who did the Osborne-1 roms didn't. 
Hence perfectly valid Z80 applications that ran on other folks' systems
would crash on the Osborne. 

>When will programmers (system *and* application) finally understand that
>everything should be programmed as portable and universal as possible ?

Exactly.

Yes, it would make an application even more bullet proof to have it save
all the Z80 registers [or don't use them :-)] before it called into
BDOS/BIOS, but folks who write BIOS software should preserve the Z80
registers to help maintain compatibility with "incorrect" software.

Hi Netlanders,

I've written a simple program to convert true Z280 mnenomics to Z80
so you can use your "old" Z80 assembler for assembling. If there's
interest on the net I'll post it (about 25k).

Subject: Z80DMA & DART
Message-ID: <7imuT1w163w@cynic.wimsey.bc.ca>

Hello all - I am disassembling a boot prom and need to know some Z80DMA 
and Z80DART stuff.  The DMA gets sent 08hex as one of the first 
instructions - then it's not used again by the prom.  The DART gets 
sent this sequence:
 
 18 01 00 03 C1 04 44 05 68 00  (the last 00 might be superfluous)
 
to initialise it, and then the command port is only used by the 
following bit of code.  
 
 
FiddleP1:
    XOR    A                ;zero A and reset flags
    OUT    (DARTAStat),A    ;send it out
    IN     A,(DARTAStat)    
    AND    1                ;mask on bit 0
    SCF                     ;set this in case it was set
    RET    Z                ;ret if the bit was not set
    OUT    (DARTAStat),A    ;SEE QUESTION TWO BELOW
    IN     A,(DARTAStat)
    AND    'p'              ;70H - mask bits 456
    RET    Z                ;ret if none of the above set
    IN     A,(DATRADat)
    LD     A,'0'            ;30H - load A without affecting flags
    OUT    (DARTAStat),A
    OR     A                
    RET
 
Question ONE:
 
What DOES the set of initialisation bytes do?
 
Question TWO:
 
What I need to know here are the meanings of the bits 0, 4, 5, and 6; 
what happens when the status register is loaded with the returned byte 
after it is masked with 0000 0001 binary; and what happnes when it is 
loaded with 030hex.
 
No, I don't have a manual/set of data sheets, nor does either of the 
libraries I tried.
 
Thanks in advance to anyone who can answer these questions for me...

Doug Braun writes about CP/M Benchmarks.
He's absolutely right: the problem is that there is no standard (not only C)
compiler for CP/M. So, for testing the machine itself, we should at least
take the most usual compiler around here. I guess, that is Turbo-Pascal 3.0.
Perhaps the MBasic-Interpreter (though a hack) could serve for this purpose,
too.
So, if we use a standard set of test routines (i.e. for integer and real
arithmetic, and for I/O on ramdisk/harddisk/floppy) and compile them with
exactly the same compiler (Turbo-3), the results should be comparable.
Although I use a Z280 too, I think it's not right to use modified compilers
for benchmarks (except when the compliers are exactly the same, and we
just want to compare some Z280 with each other).
In that means, I'm using such a benchmark (published in c't magazine some
years ago) for a long time. I might post the sources on the net, if there
is interest.

I have gotten some firmware source on a 8" CP/M floppy and want to decode
the filesystem.  I went to "Software, Etc." and at least the guys working
there had HEARD of CP/M...  The files I want can probably be extracted
just by sorting through the data sectors by hand, but I figure if I need
to do this once, I might just need to do it again, and would enjoy doing
it "right" anyway.

  perhaps i didn't make myself clear.  (entirely possible, since i'm human
and not perfect...)
 
  it's the fact that the compaticard is not cheap that causes me to post
the question in the first place.
 
  now, i know the hardware of an AT floppy controller will be able to control
an 8 inch drive.  that is understood without question, since it is basically
the same as the interface used with 8 inch drives.
 
  what i meant to ask was, "Does uniform know how to use the AT floppy
controller when it is connected to an 8 inch drive??"
 
  i have a space in my system's floppy storage system that is designed for
AT compatible HD disk drives, but what i want to know is if i were to
connect an 8 inch drive to it (with, of course, a cable that routes all
of the signals where they should go) can i expect uniform to be able to
work with this setup?  currently, i have a western digital WD1003-WA2
controller with both a st225 and a teac HD drive connected to it.  there
is room to connect another floppy drive to the controller (it supports
2 drives), and i'd like to put my 8 inch drive on that.
 
   i know a compaticard would solve the problem, but in my situation that
is not an alternative.

Of course, that is the safest way. But then, system behaviour is very
well specified (see below). So I especially wanted to emphasize the
responsibility of the application programmers (not to blame it all on
the system programmers!).

Sorry, but that's not logical. If one uses Z80 opcodes in an application, he
must be aware that at least the BIOS also uses these instructions.

Of course, in fact it doesn't matter *who* saves. Just that the system may
save registers which aren't used by the application at all.
As for the spec's: see below.

I wonder if anyone of you ever read the CP/M Programmers Guide. In this
(original DRI) document there is the clear specification. The CP/M-Plus
Programmers Guide (as I use CP/M-Plus) tells me on page 27:

	When a transient program makes a BDOS function call, the BDOS does
	not restore registers to their entry values before returning to the
	calling program. The responsiblity for saving and restoring any
	critical register values rests with the calling program.

So everyone who writes (or wants to write) applications programs should
please read the specifications before doing so.

Of course, that quotation doesn't mention Z80 registers. But if you think
logically and carefully look at the sentence, it is absolutely clear that
*every* register may be changed after returning from a system call.

BTW, even commercial programs may have bugs: In Turbo-Pascal 3.0, the IX
and IY registers aren't saved before calling the Console Input routine, but
used afterwards. So be careful. (every other Char I/O is ok!)

	Greetings. I have great news! I went out a got a fully

	disks. ALL FOR $10 (even includes zipped velcro case)!


	Anyways, I still would like to get some stuff for the

	it's $50 plus you pay shipping. No docs or disks but
	I might make copies if I get some for my other O1.


	I have a feeling that the Kaypro 10 is better than my //e :-(

	It's nice to have a 10MB drive (true, it's slow. Can I just
	slip in a 40MB and take advantage of the decreased access time?
	even if I still get 10MB...)

	It has WordStar, lots of games, Superterm, etc. installed
	on drive B0: (I'll have to read about it later) and comes
	with a 5+1/4" floppy. Quite nice. Has a parallel, serial and
	a modem port so I don't need cards, like in my Apple...

	Anyways, as for the O1, it's definitely going to be a 
	security system and I'll use the K10 as a "toy" (read:MAC).

	Take care.

	P.S. Is the little fan supposed to be on all the time or just
	when it gets too hot? Also, the POWER led does not light, but

	Greetings. I got 2 Kaypro 10's. I turn one of them on,
	nice menu appears, I can use any software I choose,
	play games, etc.

	I turn the other on and the hard disk refuses to boot
	up... no matter what I do. I put in a system disk, get
	the A0> prompt, type "dir b:", light goes on, head
	unparks, I get a "BDos err on B: Bad Sector", same
	for drive C:....

	But, interestingly, if I wait for the head to park (not
	sure if this is normal - it makes a funny sound), and
	hit spacebar, I can sometimes get a whole directory
	and only get an error on the last line... I can't run
	FINDBAD though :-)

	Also, it appears that I got the computer with its heads
	UNparked... head (gasp) crash? But why would it show
	me the directory sometimes (about 1 out of 60 times)


	Does anyone have/know of a program that will format
	and partition a new/old hardrive? FMTFLPY (sp?)
	does not work, neither does MFDISK...

	I gues I will need a WD-1002-WD0 controller card if the
	hard drive is ok, anyone have one - REAL CHEAP?

	I have other ST-212 hard drives at home so swapping one
	is no problem. I'm also handy with a soldering iron
	if anyone has any pointers. I don't want to put too
	much money into it because I have so many other micros

	and a pdp 11/73 (whew) :-) that I don't mind trashing
	this one (for parts) ;-)

	Also, my other system can not boot from the hard
	drive, but it did come with a statup disk. I can
	use the hard drive with no problems. One problem,
	to make a floppy, one needs to have A: and B: to
	be hard drives and C: to be the floppy, but if I
	have to boot with a floppy, IT gets the A: and
	B: and C: are hard drives. The GENFLPY program
	just barfs and exits with a configuration error.
	Anyone know a way around that? CONFIG does not
	seem to list it there. Yes, I did look on
	simtel and wuarchive... nothing useful. Besides,
	I can't download anything. 

	[this is getting long]

	Also, if I can prove that I have the manuals for
	a program, will they send me a copy of a disk so
	I can use?  (WordStar, for example?)

	
	Take care.

I'm using WordStar on an Osborne 1 along with Kermit, trying to program
a microcomputer board I built using BASIC-52 (Intel).

Files created with WordStar must contain some binary characters, which is
ruining the "raw" upload of program code to the uC board.

I need a real, flat ASCII file on disk- so is there easily available a
utility to massage WordStar output?

I suppose one could use PIP's Z option, and/or an MBASIC program- but I'll
bet this is a problem others have already beaten.  True?

        I recently acquired an Otrona/IEEE-488 hard drive.
Unfortunately, the drive stops working after 10-15 minutes of
operation.  The problem appears to be in the controller card
in the external drive box.

        1.  Have any of you ever encountered a similar problem?
        2.  Does anyone have:

well, CP/M itself doesn't use the special registers, but the BIOS might,
since that was supplied from the manufacturer of the machine.  there is 
another problem, though, in that some z-80 BIOS' were written in such way
that the index registers of the z-80 as well as the alternate register
set were used as temporary storage between calls, and applications that
used these registers would bomb on machines that expected those values
to still be there.
 
CP/M itself (for BDOS calls) doesn't preserve any registers.  (which led to
programs being littered with  PUSH B! PUSH D! PUSH H and corresponding
pops after each BDOS call)  perhaps it would be best to assume the bios
doesn't save the special registers in the z-80.   but an unacceptable
situation is where the BIOS requires the application to not change the 
value of those registers.
 
sure, CP/M is an 8080 operating system, but since most CP/M machines still
working these days are Z-80 based, then perhaps it should be considered a
z-80 operating system.  writing applications to run under z-80 CP/M should
be free to use those registers, but not expect the operating system to
preserve the contents.  (exception - interrupt handlers.)
 
people who own machines with a BIOS that does store values in special z80
registers would probably have to hack their BIOS so that it doesn't.  those
writing programs that use special z80 registers should PUSH them before
a BDOS call and POP them after the call, assuming they need to save the 
contents of those registers.

to mail it to me - I would then get 3+ copies of it. (I pay by kilobyte).

What is the convention for the "true" file length byte in CPM Plus?
(It's set by setting flag f6' and putting the byte value in CR).
I assume it is the number of unused bytes in the last sector. Is this right?

On mine, it's due to having to scroll the screen contens up a line.  I've got
an 84 model or three,  and it keeps chars fine after a screen clear until
it hits line 25 and then begins to scroll and lose chars 3 to 6 of every
line.  Really annoying.  Got the uC Max Rom and it worked until I got a
Maestro 2400ZXR modem.  Now it's just as bad as before with 1200 baud!

I changed the 6845 too and it does make a difference, but not enough.  We're
gonna have to fix this one for good Guys!  Damn.

Hmmm...  I have NOT used word-scar in years, but I recall that if you use it
in "document mode" by selecting "open document file" on it's mail menu, it
will set the high order bits of the first (or was it the last) character in
wach string token (ie. word in a sentence.)  You can opt for opening your 
files in "non-document" mode and this will not happen, but you will see some
other differences like fixed tab sizes and so on.  I always used non-doc mode
when in word-scar when I was using it for this exact reason.  I think it is
safe to say that in non-doc mode, word-scar is like a full screen ed.

If you do not know what I am talking about, then either wordstar is not what it
was 10 years ago, or you have never run it w/o specifying a file name as the
file to edit.  Just run it w/o any perameters and you will get a menu that
includes "open doc file" and "open non-doc file".  I think there was also some
way to set it up so that non-doc was the default mode with some setup program
that it came with.

Hope that's it.

The thing to do (perhaps you know this) is to run wordstar in
non-document mode - then you read and write plain old ascii files and
all is well.  A contract I have made with myself is to NEVER type
the filename to be edited on the command line (wordstar is most commonly
installed to use document mode by default - putting all those nasty binary
chars in your file (and setting the 8th bit in some others as well
as part of it's way of "marking" up your file.)  Then type N and then type
your filename --- if you mistakenly start wordstar in document mode on
your 2999 line source file DON'T SAVE IT!!! use the abort and exit command
(whatever that is, I forget), and start over.  If you did save it .........
....... you poor guy ..... try the following recipe.

Just talked to my CPM guru nextdoor and he says to write a simple
filter that does this - 
Read the file byte by byte.
Force the high bit in every byte to zero on every byte read.
Delete every byte that is < 0x20 (blank) and that is
not 0x09, 0x0a, 0x0c, 0r 0x0d  (tab,newline,formfeed,return).

A code fragment in C would be something like this:
(this has not been tested, but this is the idea)

    while ( c = getchar() ) {
	c &= 0x7f;
	if ( c < 0x20 ) {
	    if ( c == 0x09 || c == 0x0a || c == 0x00c || c == 0x0d )
		putchar(c);
	} else
	    putchar(c);
    }

Message-ID: <1990Dec12.101626.16284@techbook.com>

   well, after a little experimentation, it seems that uniform
DOES know how to massage an AT disk controller (HD) to produce
8 inch disk formats.   however, i do not know if the formats it
produces are readable on 8 inch machines.  all i did was install
my dsqd 5.25 inch drive as an 8 inch dsdd drive, and try the 8 inch
formats.   it does format the 5.25 inch drive as either 77 or 154
tracks (depending on single or double sided formats) and it can
read its own formats.   now, to find out for sure if you can use
an AT floppy port, I (or someone who has a spare floppy) will have to
wire up an 8 inch drive to the 5.25 inch controller and see if
it really does work.

i had a file around here that showed how to wire a HD drive to an
8 inch port, and imagine that i'll have to use the same cable
for the 8 inch drive to 5.25 inch controller.  problem is, it's
buried in a couple boxes of 8 inch cp/m disks and i don't relish
the thought of spelunking into that box to find it.  besides, since
there are probably other people on the net that want this information,
could someone be so kind as to post that file for us??

also, if anyone has any comments or suggestions concerning making a
cable for this, feel free to add to the discussion.  i'm going to
have to visit the library sometime later in the week and see what
signals on the interface will have to go where, and work from that,
but if someone knows it off of the top of their head, it would
save me a trip into downtown portland, something i also do not
relish.

and lastly, if someone does try this and get it working, please let
everyone else know of your success, and perhaps even post some
tips on getting it all to work.

but it looks like the hard part is over.  uniform does know how to
work a HD controller.

I have an SD-Systems setup, using their Versafloppy III (?) from back
before the flood.  This controller has a connector for 5 in. drives,
but I've been unsuccessful getting it to run an AT-style (dshd) drive.
Any suggestions welcome: is the connector the same for the hd drive as
for the dsdd model? Termination of cable req'd?  Jumpers somewhere?
Symptoms are that my FORMAT selects the drive and steps across it
(trying various formats originally intended for 5 in. drives), then
doesn't find the format when I look for the directory, use STAT, or
run DTYPE (a drive checking utility which looks at formats).  Any
suggestions welcome.  BTW, the card set originally came from JADE.
It has worked impeccably, except I had apparently a defective mapping
PROM, for which JADE sold me a replacement.  Thanks.  :=).

Even in non-document mode, WordStar will set the high bit of the character
the cursor is on at the time of the disk save.  It's entirely too nervous
for my application, unless the output is filtered through an external utility.

   WordStar files created in DOCUMENT mode have many characters with the high
bit set, especially when justification has been turned on.  However, if you
create the document in NONDOCUMENT mode, then it should be a pure ASCII file,
or so I have always believed.

   There are utilities that will do this, but why don't you try using
WordStar's own nondocument mode?

The 1.2M floppy format uses the same data-transfer rate as an 8" drive
(500Kbits/sec). This is also true for 1.44M drives.

360K floppies use the standard 250Kbits/sec.

All IBM formats use MFM (Double-density).

CP/M uses FM (single density), and MFM.

RE: WordStar Utility

Try Irv Hoff's FILT7, which should be available on your local RCP/M
or SIMTEL20.  If all else fails, message me and I will send you a
copy.

FILT7 is pretty good, and has several options built into the program.
Its other upside is that it is fast and small (ie: it won't hog a chunk
of your disk space).

THere is a program called VDOEDIT (sp?) in Simtel that is a raw-text word
processor with WORDSTAR COMMANDS!!! (which I assume is the only reason why you'd
    want to hold on to WS despite its peculiarity).

In fact, the "binary" elements in the WOrdstar output can be removed,
I think, by "clearing" the MSB (bit 7) of each byte. Word star uses all
ASCII code for formating (unlike, say, WOrdPerfect), so getting rid of the end-
of-word markers would just do fine.

Hmmmm, time to play with WordStar again.  I have never had that happen to me

When I was still using my old WordStar on an 8080 S-100 CPM system, 
used Irv Hoff's "filt.com" program. It would strip all the high
order bits, etc and give you a plain ASCII file. It's probably 
available on CompuSee's CPM forum. (My version is probably buried
in the basemenon an 8" floppy....somewhere....maybe)

A similar program is available froStarFixer called FileFixer that
does a similar job for MSDOS WordStar afficionados.
Good Luck in your search.

With WordStar 4.0 for CP/M, you have a couple of options.  You can force
it to open a file in non-document mode from the command line:

	ws filename.ext n

If you do accidently create a file in document mode, you can always use
good ol' pip to strip the high bits off:

	pip ascii.txt:=highbits.doc[z]

WordStar 4.0 can also strip the high bits.  Re-open the file in non-document
mode, then use ^B (I believe -- it might be ^^) to convert the file to an 
ascii file.  Use ^QQ^B, and then WordStar do its stuff.

Can't you guys strip off the high bits by printing to a file?  Worked fine
for me the last time I did it.
That's a lot easier than using utilities!

I have a single-sheet mailing from them from October 1988.  The only price
they show is a "special student discount price" of $29.95, plus $5 s/h.
This package includes the compiler (with 434-page book), a split-screen
editor and a windowing source-level debugger.  Unfortunately, only the
compiler is part of the CP/M version; the other goodies were developed for
MS-DOS (the sheet, in fact, is very much MS-DOS-oriented).  I don't
remember why they sent me the "educational package" price; it may be that
that had become their price for all customers.  Anyway, for more up-to-date
information (it's Sunday, so I can't do it), you can contact them at:

	Mix Software
	1132 Commerce Drive
	Richardson, TX 75081
	214-783-6001

By the way, they claim to support the full K&R standard, including bit
fields plus enums and structure assignments.  You may not want to use these
features yourself, but it's increasingly likely that you'll encounter them
in PD source.  Just yesterday I was burned by BDS C's refusal to allow
static assignment of character arrays.  This further complicated building
of sgrep from a C Users' Group diskette.  I *still* prefer BDS C to Aztec C
for stuff I need to run small and fast, though.

On the other hand, be sure that these advertised features are actually
in the *CP/M* version; many commercial vendors are simply selling older
versions, having ceased development years ago.  These often started as
"subset" compilers, and were done well before enums, etc. became popular.
Good luck.  

Oh yes, please post what you learn, particularly about the status of their 
CP/M support.

				-Jim.

Hello everyone,
 
Some time ago someone on this newsgroup mentioned a C compiler by MIX Software
for cp/m.  Does anyone know if this compiler is still available?  As I recall,
the package was around $25US and included a book on C, does anyone have any
other details to share? Your assistance is appreciated.

                    ========================

Hello Lance, yes I'm the one with the MIX C compiler (CP/M 
version) for sale.  Yes, it includes and excellent C tutorial in 
the 430 page manual.  The price is $20.00 plus $5.00 for S&H (UPS 
ground in the continental US).  I will quote shipping charges to 
other areas.

The MIX C compiler is a full K & R implementation of the C 
language.  The system requirements are:
   CP/M-80 (2.0 or higher)
   55K memory
   2 disk drives (or HD)
   Z80 CPU

I can install the software on many UNIFORM supported 5.25", CP/M 
disk formats, but the only ones that I can test are TeleVideo and 
360K IBM formats.  If you can transfer the files from one of 
those, I suggest you order in that format.  I can also arrange 
for you to download the software from my BBS.  Feel free to send 
e-mail or call for additional information.  Take care.

What do you mean by "quad"?  I've heard it used several different
ways.  Quad meaning either the high density disks (1200k), or the
DD 96tpi.  If you're talking about the latter, it should be the
same rate as DSDD, 48tpi.

I have original, brand new, WordStar 3.3 for sale.  Software is 
on 8 inch diskette (Xerox) and it has a deluxe manual (with 3 
ring binder).  This software is registerable and upgradable, even 
to WordStar 6.0 (for DOS if you're so inclined).  I can transfer 
the WordStar to 5.25" diskette (TeleVideo CP/M or IBM format 
suggested) that is supported by UNIFORM, but those are the 2 that 
I can test.

The price is $30.00 plus $5.00 for S&H (UPS ground, anywhere in 
the continental US).  I can quote you shipping charges to other 
areas.  Thanks and take care.

Could someone help me out a bit.  I have found an old Device
called a CP/M Companion 2.2.  This is a small case with a handle
on it.  It has a disk drive and a small light on the front which
says "virtual disk" next to it.  It has three rs-232 type ports
on it labelled, parallel, modem/host, and terminal.

Do you know what this is and if it is worth while for meto
try to use it?  I have an Apple IIe.  I thought maybe the disk drive
might be useful or maybe some of the chips???   Any thoughts?

I would also consider selling it if someone wants it.

Please e-mail to    mdgoodma@crdec8.apgea.army.mil

or you may reply here.  But the e-mail address is preferred.

Sorry about the messed up quoting above, guys.  Still learning this 
editor.  
Anyway I ahve MIX C for CP/M and it IS K&R standard.  The split screen 
editor is a seperate package, which I also have.  The editor uses a lot 
of overlays, so it would be slow on a floppy; on a HD it's ok, on a 
ramdisk it would be great.  It's a very complete editor - you can 
redefine EVERYTHING, it does macros, it works on disk based files 
(there's another slowdown) and it comes quite well documented.
 
All this I got some (3?) years ago so it might not be available but if it 
is go for it.  The compiler has BIOS routines, a speedup optimizer, and a 
shrink optimizer, and a linker I think.  The tutorial is really good - 
you can learn C from it.

Quad density and High density are *NOT* the same thing, even though they both
have 96tpi.  You did answer my question though.  :-)  Thanks.

Subject: Wordstar and the high bit
Message-ID: <009414CF0E8414E0.000010C0@dcs.simpact.com>

Generally the first thing you need on a cpm/m machine is a comms program,
to dig around BBSs for old software - and the second thing is a filter to
strip the junk out of the capture buffers.  You can write it in any
language you like, but you will surely need it; quite often pip..[Z]
makes an acceptable substitute.

Wordstar obviously had this question come up too often, because they put
a 'print to ASCII file' output into CP/M 4.0, and into all subsequent
(MSDOS) versions.  If you are editing, not telecommunicating, and don't
want the stuff there in the first place, you can set a flag in Wordstar
so it comes up in the N mode as a default; then you can only do D editing
from the main menu.  Or use vde, which doesn't put junk in the file until
you tell it to.

I've never had Wordstar (3.0 or 3.3) set a bit in an N-edited file at the
cursor position; which version were you running?

The real problem is a file with a premature ^Z, so that nothing beyond that
point can be seen by an editor.  DDT is then the only cure.

Good luck, anyway - Will

I tried to do that so I can print a text file (a PD software manual written

Subject 1:     Ascii output from WStar

Using WordStar 3.3 or 3.0, I have no problems creating an ascii file -
even though I have not yet figured out the difference between document
and non-document mode.

I create files without justification, and don't use anything fancy such
as underscore or bold.  When it is time to save and up-load, I start
printing (even though I don't even have a printer yet).  One of the options
is "print to disk" - this allows me to enter a file-name and save the file.

This new file, when uploaded with Kermit, contains no control characters.

Subject 2:      Where can I get WordStar 4.0?

Now a question: I would like to upgrade to WordStar 4.0 (for CP/M 2.24d)
                I have an IMS (Industrial Micro Systems) machine with
                the 8 inch floppy disk drives (DD/SD).  Any used (and legal)
                copy with documentation for sale, or an address of a
                distributor with an idea of cost, would be much appreciated.

Some time ago there was a request for information/review of the various CP/M C
compilers.  I would like to see a posting of the various compilers with
their pros and cons.  I would be happy to collect this info and post a 
summary, but I suspect this has alread been done (maybe I missed it?).

I have used the Aztec compiler with complete satisfaction, MIX is a new one,
I have the BDS 1.50 compiler sitting on the shelf and have not yet given it
a try.  I have some projects up and coming where I will want to ROM the code,
any suggestions on whether Aztec or BDS would be better for this?  Actually
any hints on ROMing C code for a Z80 controller kind of project would be
happily accepted.

I believe what is refered to as quad-density is also known as a 720k drive,
(the nomenclature is a bit sloppy, quad density means different things in
different contexts) and indeed has a 250kb/s xfer rate - the density being
acheived by higher track density (96tpi instead of the usual 48tpi).

BTW, for you transfer rate trivia freaks, did you know that a floppy written
on a 360kb drive and later read on a 1.2M drive (AT, HD 5.25in) has a xfer
rate of 300kb/s since the 1.2M drive rotates at 360 rpm, but the 360kb drive
rotated at 300rpm - this in part explains why you can read 360kb floppies on
such drives, but may have trouble writing to them (the other part is probably
the slimmer heads on the 1.2M drive).

I always used to use this method. An alternative is to get the PD VDE 2.66
editor from Simtel20. With this, you can load up a file in document mode
and save it back in non-document mode with the high bits stripped. Frankly
after using VDE on CP/M I wouldn't go back to Wordstar 3 unless I absolutely
had to (e.g. for a large file which VDE can't handle).
 
However, the high-bit problem isn't the only one you need to get round to
produce a pure ASCII file from a WS document file.
 
 If you have used print control
codes (e.g ^A, ^S, ^T, ^B etc.) you will need to strip those out too. WS
3.3 will replace most of them by nothing in a  global replacement, but it
won't recognize ^S (underline) in replacement mode. WS 4 (at least the DOS
version) will. With VDE, you could write a macro to do it. Alternatively,
having stripped the high bits with PIP ..[Z], you would need to run the file
through a second filter to get rid of the control codes. The following bit
of MS-BASIC code gives an idea:
 
[Initialization]
ctrl%=""
FOR n= 1 to 9
ctrl%=ctrl%+chr%(n)
next
for n=11 to 12
ctrl%=ctrl%+chr%(n)
next
For n=14 to 25
ctrl%=ctrl%+chr%(n)
next
[leave chr%(10) and (13) in]
....
[processing the file]
(assumes that infile is no. 1, outfile no. 2)
 
while not eof(1)
 line input #1, a%
 for count=1 to len(ctrl%)
  x=instr(a%,mid%(ctrl%,count,1))
  while x >0
   mid%(a%,x,1)="":' [or " " if you're worried about zero bytes]
   x=instr(a%,mid%(ctrl%,count,1))
  wend
 next count
 print #2,a%
wend
 
My syntax may be a bit ropey, but this gives the general idea. Let's
have a C version, please.

   That seems to be not the whole initialization :-)

The DART status register is as follows:
bit 7 : break
bit 6 : not used
bit 5 : cts
bit 4 : ri
bit 3 : dcd
bit 2 : tx buffer empty
bit 1 : int. pending (ch. A only)
bit 0 : rx char available

Be aware that you need only two addresses per channel, so the addresses of
the status register and the command register are equal (see init part).
So sending 00 to that address resets the internal register pointer (so that
the next read-access will safely get the status register).
The second output does exactly the same, as the value in A will always be 00.
Outputting 30h to the command register means 'error reset'.

Hope this may help you.

I snagged from Thousand Oaks to work with my CompuPro 8/16
running Concurrent DOS (and mebbe I *MIGHT* let Marc Wilson have
a copy of it too (just ribbin' ya, Marc)).  The code I got from
TO was ported to CI's C, and I'm having a hell of a time trying

I thought that 1.2M floppy drives had a speed select line that allowed the
speed to be switched between 300rpm and 360rpm.....O.K. here it is from an
article in "The Computer Journal" from issue 44, page 17:
 
         ... It [a 1.2meg drive] is an 80 track double-sided drive,
         that, when pin 2 is pulled low, increases its rotational
         speed to 360 rpm.  At the same time, the NEC 765 floppy
         controller doubles its data rate to 500K bits/sec, and writes
         15 sectors of 512 bytes/sector.
 
Since pin 2 is normally low, the drive ends up spinning at 360 rpm, unless
allowed to change in the controller hardware (a speed select latch??).

If that's so, is a value of zero in this place mean that the last block
contains 128 used bytes? The "unused bytes" scenario seems more natural...

Clarification anyone?

Ise Henin asked the question "Where can I get WordStar 4.0?"  I would 
recommend that he talk directly with Micropro.  When I bought the upgrade for
my Intertec Compustars, I had to get WS4 for my home Kaypro, and do an 
electronic transfer to the Intertecs.  I got Micropro's permission to do this
type of transfer.  They had WordStar 4.0 in stock on a series of systems, but
not mine.  I bought 2 copies, and did the electronic transfer, and have 4.0
working fine on my systems.

The number I have is 800-227-5609, extension 769.  They are located at:

		Micropro International Corporation
		33 San Pablo Avenue
		San Rafael, CA  94903

One and a half years ago, Micropro still was available to assist me in an 
installation problem.  That was super for an 'obsolete' operating system.  
Other software houses have not been anywhere as helpful with their stock 
answer 'We don't support CP/M any more', or 'CP/M, what's that?'

Other phone numbers for Micropro from the installation manual are

		415-499-8864
		415-499-5693 (for WordStar CP/M Edition)

Message-ID: <28971@usc>

With the KayPLUS ROM, I can run at a peak of 4800 baud.  I can't quite
remember, but I think that consecutive screen-clears will ultimately cause
a char to be dropped.

The uC ROM is no better than the Kaypro ROM regarding screen update speed.
In other words, it is not very good.  However, one should note that the
6845 setup on the Kaypro is a poor h/w job; the video s/w is stuck with
all the work and handshaking and timing -- no fun at all.  The uC and
Kaypro original s/w tried to compensate and ended up with an effective
but slower solution.

If you happen to have an old S-100 mainframe box with

to get rid of for a few dollars, drop a note to me.
I already have a Wameco (sp?) digital readout type
display, so what I am looking for is the LED type.
I believe there were 3 common systems sold with LED
front panels. I am looking for intact front panels and
motherboard/box/power supplies, nothing mangled, please.

"Quad density" is a mis-nomer.  It started many many years ago when someone
(I think it was Micropolis) was able to reduce the step positions reliably.
The first drives were 100 tpi (that's right), later to become 96 tpi so
that you could double step  96 tpi to read 48 tpi disks.

"Quad density" is an advertising gimmick that stuck.  It is nothing more
than double density with twice the tracks, erg "quad capacity" should have
been the name.  Transfer rate is the same 250K/bits/sec.   8" single
density is also this rate, only the DD use 500k, which was only about 15%
slower than first PC hard drives

Message-ID: <28972@usc>

Regarding the "length byte" in CP/M 3.0.

Checking my CP/M Plus manual, it is indeed the length in bytes (module 128).
Thus, a value of "00" means the sector is full.

In fact, that is the default because it is up to the application to set this
value.  There are FEW programs which worry or care about the length of the
last sector in CP/M since there was never this mechanism in CP/M 2.2 which
is still the mainstay (or clone-stay) of CP/M these days.

Unless you are strictly in CP/M+ land and ALL of your applications know it,
use of this byte is of no help.

The DR CP/M 3 manual says "This facility can identify THE LAST BYTE of 
the last record of the file."  Whether DR counts beginning at 0 or at 1 
is not stated.
 
However, the value is set to 0 when the file is created and has a zero 
length.  Maybe you have to look at the record count in this case to 
deduce what number DR starts with.

     It's an SIO.  According to Mostek's 1985 data book, the 3884 is
the version that has *TxCB and *RxCB bonded together.

     Any Z80 data book should have what you need.

IMHO that is a little silly.  My terminal program (runs in the
native mode of my CP/M machine) traps that.   I did this mostly
because the screen is bit-mapped (16K) and takes _ages_ to clear
(well, ages in processor time!).    Some of the BB systems I know
(Opus particularly) send 3 or 4 clear screen sequences. 
 
I would have thought that any reasonable bios/comms program would
have the same trap.

No. Not true.  I don't know of any BIOSes in Kaypro/Xerox land that
trap multiple screen clears.  COMM programs (by and large) do not know
the clear screen sequence for the local terminal or, if they do, do
not check for repeating sequences.

Otherwise, I agree that multiple sequential screen clears are goofy and
unnecessary.

Tom, 

   There was a version of PCfile that was written for CP/M.  The primary computer it was to run on, though, was OS-1.  It will work with the Kaypro, but the opening screens are all trash. The upshot is  that if  they ever convert to Ms-Dos, the can upgrade to a PC version and still use their old files.  E-Mail me if you can't find it.

   i'm having a problem installing the hard disk version of 
pickles and trout cp/m on my tandy 16b with 12 meg hard disk.

   after running the system configuration MENU, and selecting the
hard disk module and a proper hard disk table, i reboot the system
like i'm supposed to.   after a little bit of floppy disk grinding, 
the loader writes on the screen 'Load Error 99' and things come to
a halt.   the hard disk is functional since i ran xenix on it, and
i powered everything up in the proper sequence.  (hard disk first.)

   after repeated attempts, i still get the same message.  usually, 
when the loader complains with an error message, it's because there is
an essential file that is missing, but i seem to have all of the
files needed to install the system.  even when i disable the hard disk
by deselecting the hard disk module in the installation, the system
stills gives the same error message.  

   does anyone know what could be causing this problem??

Hello All --

I'm the proud (?) owner of some surplus Z80 boards that look like they
have connectors for the Apple bus on them.  There was no documentation
available, and I'm wondering if any of you Apple CP/Mers might be able
to help identify them.  They are marked "Advanced Logic Systems".  There
is a "Z80 Card" that is a Z80B and little else but some interface chips
and a small PROM/ROM(?).  It does not even have an on-board clock that I
can see.  Also I have a "CP/M Card" from the same vendor.  It is unpopulated,
but looks like it would have memory, a crystal, etc.  There are no component
values or IC id's on the silk screen.  Can somebody tell me if they are
useful, or if there is documentation available for them??

If the board has some DRAM, it's the ALR Z80 card. If no ram
of its own, it may be a clone of the Microsoft Z80 card. These
each require their own boot disks, but data disks are compatible
between the two systems. The ALR card supported some add-on cards
for extra memory , maybe even a version of CP/M Plus.

Message-ID: <1990Dec24.162439.6459@ccu.umanitoba.ca>

Hello net world. I recently found CP/M 86 for the IBM DisplayWriter.
It appears to function well and makes what was otherwise a word processor
into a real computer of sorts. In the setup.cmd program it has configurations
for communication ports which it can't detect. From this I presume the
DisplayWriter can have communucation ports but this unit doesn't. Any ideas
where I can find such a board? Hopefully they are standard RS232's. 
Also of course now we need software. Does anyone out there have anything
for CP/M 86 formatted to a DisplayWriter readable 8" disk. The stuff of
interest would be:
	some sort of database (dbase 2?)
	some sort of spreadsheet (supercalc?)
	programming languages (mbasic, pl/1, fortran, cbasic, pascal)
	communications program to go with serial board
 
maybe i'm working on the silly assumption that such stuff actually made
it to CP/M 86, but it seems to be a pretty good, fast OS. also, does
anyone have some technical specs on the DisplayWriter? We didn't get any
manuals with it.

I think that any old 8" SSSD CP/M disk will be readable by the thing.

I know that spreadsheets, programming languages, and communications
programs made it to CP/M-86. I've seen (but, alas, don't have) Microsoft's
MultiPlan, a C compiler or two, and I've got KERMIT for my Rainbow. The
old Turbo Pascal manual (you know, version 3.01A and before; when it was
good) has a section on CP/M-86. I wouldn't be surprised if you could still
get CP/M-86 Turbo from Borland; it was only a few years ago that I ordered
8" CP/M-80 Turbo from them.

Glad to hear you've got it running.

Subject: emulator for TeleVideo 1603

I have an old TeleVideo 1603 pc that I would like to use to access my
account at this university.  Unfortunately the mainframe expects to
see an IBM pc, a VT100, or three other rather obscure terminals when
I dial in.  Does anyone know of an emulator (IBM or VT100) that would
run on a 1603?  I have two communications packages that run under
CPM-86 on the TeleVideo: TeleAsync and Mite.  I have managed to log
on to my account with Mite (which I tell the mainframe is a VT100
terminal) but have problems with the screen not clearing.  Emulation
can be added to Mite, but I don't have any program docs to see what that
involves.  I'm not even sure if the company which marketed Mite is still
around.  Any information on Mite would also be greatly appreciated.

Thanks, in advance.

This is the WS that came with the Osborne 1- v 2.26.  It *does* funky things,
even in non-doc mode.  Trust me! :-)

I am most assuredly not hell-bent on WS, it's just what I have.  I can try
PIP [z], printing to disk, another editor, or a utility.  One of those ought
to do it!

I wish I'd said I knew about non-doc mode in my original letter- oh well.

 Aha! Some versions of WordStar supported direct write to screen
memory on the (few) machines that had screen memory as part of
system RAM. I suspect that setting the high bit is the way the
Osborne knew to highlight the current character.

Message-ID: <779@organpipe.UUCP>

Has anyone out there ever heard of an Omti Series 10 SASI controller?
I am looking for specs, manual, any info.
I have two of these, each mounted on 8-inch winchesters (Quantum Q2020).
I need enough info to write a new driver for these things.  In particular
I need the details for the format and the set drive parameters commands.
In particular, want to know if this thing will handle a Q2040.
Any help will really be appreciated - I have gone most of the way reverse
engineering the thing (drew the schematic, read out and disassembled the
microcode roms, you wouldn't believe it ... ). The closest thing I got to
getting help from the manufacturer was talking to an engineer on the phone
who said,
>Yes I remember working late nights on that one, it warms my heart to know
>someone out there is still using it.
Anyhow, this thing works, so if someone out there has
any documentation it will warm MY heart to hear from you!

some CPM disks from a DIRECT machine.  He needs to transfer this 
data to MS-DOS format.  I told him I would try reading his disks
with my C-128 running CPM+, but I didn't have any luck.  All I 
really need to do is read the data off the disks and upload it to
another system, I don't actually have to transfer to another disk.
Does anyone know anything about the DIRECT computer and its disk 
format?  Any suggestions would be most appreciated.  Please reply
by mail, as I might miss your message otherwise.

Probably his best shot is to find someone with a PC and UniForm-PC or 22Disk
who should be able to read them easily.  There is a Direct 1025 listed in
UniForm-PC, and likely in 22Disk, also.

Subject: emulator for TeleVideo 1603

Many thanks to David Fetrow and Bill Marcum for their suggestions
concerning possible ways to use a TeleVideo 1603 pc to log into the
mainframe at my university.

Further perusal of the help files reveals that it is possible to log
in in line mode.  Not really a very satisfactory solution.

A few weeks back I checked the kermserv at Columbia to see if there
was a version of Kermit for the TeleVideo.  The best I could find
was a CPM-86 version that might (???) run on the TeleVideo, or a
generic MS-DOS version that pokes along at 1200 bps.  Anyone know
of a version of Kermit that will run on a TeleVideo?  The IBM/MS-DOS
version I have seen does vt100 emulation.  I'm hopping that any
version of Kermit for the TeleVideo might be similarly configured.

Thanks.

Subject: Help with embedded ^Z
Message-ID: <5687@spdcc.SPDCC.COM>

I was adding some control characters to a text file for a printer and,
without realising the consequences, added a control Z in the first line
of the file.

I've tryed using pip thus:
>pip
*a.a=b.b[osStuff^Z]

Where "Stuff" is a string that occurs in the second block of the file.

No luck, Word Master still won't edit the file.  I don't have a lot of
the utilities around, BASIC-80 and PIP usually do the trick.  I tryed
reading the file in BASIC, no luck.

Any help would be appreciated ...
