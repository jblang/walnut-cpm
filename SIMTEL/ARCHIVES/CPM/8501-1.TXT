The dust consists of the minerals that are found in your water supply.
If you live in a hard water area, the humidifier will leave a
noticeable layer of dust on objects in the room.

One humidifier manufacturer suggests in the owners manual, "If this
humidifier will be operated in a room containing electronic equipment,
USE DISTILLED WATER ONLY".

Subject: RBBS version 3.7 now available

The latest version of RBBS, the MBASIC Remote Bulletin Board System
program, is now available from SIMTEL20:

Filename			Type	 Bytes	 CRC

Directory MICRO:<CPM.RBBS>
RBBS37-1.LBR.1			COM	134272  3041H
RBBS37-2.LBR.1			COM	 67456  B0AAH

The first .LBR is all you need to get up and running.  The second is
source code and not needed since the already-compiled program is
supplied in RBBS37-1.LBR.  You configure your system name, password,
where files are to be stored, etc., in easily installed files using
RBBSINST.COM.

Thanks to Dennis Recla for this version.  Here are his comments about
what's in the two LBRs:

RBBS37-1.LBR contains the files necessary to run RBBS37.  These are the
running .COM files and sample message files.
 
-README .001   1K | BOOTPWD .      1K | BULLETIN.      1K | CALLERS .      1K
COMMENTS.      1K | COUNTERS.      1K | ENTERCPM.      1K | HELP    .      1K
INFO    .      1K | LASTCALR.      1K | MENURBBS.      1K | MESSAGES.      1K
NEWCOM  .      1K | NEWS    .      1K | RBBS    .COM   1K | RBBS37  .COM  45K
RBBS37  .DQC  22K | RBBSINST.COM  27K | RBBSINST.HQP   7K | RBBSUTIL.COM  25K
SUMMARY .      1K | TWIT    .      1K | USERS   .      1K | pwds    .      1K

Remember RBBS.COM is a special file that allows you to leave it in A0: and
run the real RBBS.COM program in A14:.

Also.. the file  pwds  is not in this .LBR since there is no way to produce
a lowercase file in a .LBR.

RBBS37-2.LBR contains the source code files for the .COM files
in RBBS37-1.LBR.
 
-README .002   1K | RBBS37  .AQC  27K | RBBS37NC.AQC  20K | RBBSINST.AQC  11K 
RBBSUTIL.AQC   9K

Separating the files in this way allows you to download a single .LBR with
all the files you need to run the system.

	After considerable testing, an apparent bug has been found in
nswp207. The following conditions will cause problems.

	Hardware:	Lobo MAX-80
	OS:		CPM Plus
	
	When copying a file with the 'm' command, if the source file is
over 1 extent long, and you tell it to copy to a drive that is not ready,
i.e. no disk in drive, the SOURCE file is truncated to 1 extent. If the
file is important, this could ruin your entire day. Nswp205, disk7 and
PIP do not exhibit this behavior and nswp207 does not have the problem
under CP/M 2.2 with the same hardware. 5 in., 8 in. and hard disk do not
seem to make any difference, if the destination drive is not ready, the
source file is eaten.

	The number for Dave Rand given in nswp2.ws is no longer valid, if
someone would make sure this file gets to him, it would be appreciated. 
In the meanwhile, either be careful or use nswp205. My thanks to Mr. Rand
and many others who make the fruits of their labors available for all
to use and learn.

To:  info-cpm@AMSAA.ARPA
Message-ID:  <850102153928.007926@HI-MULTICS.ARPA>


I recently downloaded the Small C library from Simtel.  The fputs
function in the library recognizes only <lf> as the line termination
character, while Mince puts in only <cr> (beats me why this is the
case).  My primary use for Small C is programs to massage Mince-made
files.  So I made a two-line addition, reassembled the module, and
rebuilt clib.rel with the new iolib entry.  In the process I made the
following discovery:

The version of clib.rel on Simtel links properly into compiler-produced
code with the L80 command

L80 <prog>, clib/s, <prog>/n/e

The reassembled version would not put a JMP instruction in 100h unless I
converted an internal label in iolib (START) to public, and used the
command line

L80 <prog>, clib/s, <prog>/n/e:START

Clearly, the orignal author did something in M80 or LIB so that L80
would recognize the internal label START of some middle module in
clib.rel as the start of the program.  I am using the Apple version of
M80/L80/LIB from Microsoft and can find no hint of how to do this trick
in their documentation.  Can any of the old hands out there tell me what
was done?

Subj: Wanted: Testsites for DateStamper


DateStamper(TM) provides  automatic, transparent, and virtually
instantaneous date- and time-stamping for CP/M 2.2 files.
With a real-time clock, date plus actual time is stamped; otherwise,
the date plus a 'relative' time (the ordinal count of
file accesses).   DateStamper runs with all CP/M-standard programs;
files and disks are fully compatible with standard CP/M.

DateStamper is currently available in a special version for all
Kaypros that have Plu*Perfect Systems' enhanced CP/M 2.2E operating
system.  The general CP/M version is expected to be released in late February.
(The Kaypro-only version is $39 from Plu*Perfect Systems; the 
general version will be under $50 in 8-inch format.  They include
full-featured directory and file-maintenance utilities.)

Beta-test sites for the general version are needed to shake out
interfacing to the variety of real-time clocks used in CP/M installations.

Beta sites requirements:
   *  CP/M 2.2.
   *  Real-time hardware or terminal clock.  
   *  ASM programming experience.
   *  Willingness to contribute clock-interfacing code and documentation.

If you would like to assist with testing DateStamper, please reply
directly to me with a summary of your clock and other 2.2 system
hardware.

Manny,

I'm sorry, but there are no guest accounts on SIMTEL20.  However,
almost all the files available here in MICRO:<CPM.*> are also
available on the Royal Oak RCPM system in a suburb of Detroit, MI.
I'm sure that this information is little consolation, but certainly
better than being completely cut off.  In fact, while you have the
chance, why don't you grab MICRO:<CPM.MISC>RCPM-054.LQT and see if you
can find an RCPM system in your area...

Indeed Adaptec sells a Z80-ST506 harddisk adaptor that plugs into the Z-80

could connect a Xebec SCSI-ST506 interface(aka Host Adaptor) The adaptec one
requires you to relocate your CP/M image down by 2K leave your BIOS alone,
insert their driver, and poof you are up and running.

Subject: BU hard disk backup updated

BU Version 1.1 updated by Bernie Eiben <EIBEN at DEC-MARLBORO> is now
available on SIMTEL20: 

Filename			Type	 Bytes	 CRC

Directory MICRO:<CPM.HDUTL>
BU-11.LBR.1			COM	 37632  7A85H

Here is Bernie's description of his updates:

Changed  BU to keep file-attributes, when moving files to floppy - makes it
easier to use NSWEEP to restore.  Changed ERASE algorithm to allow to  wipe
files with attributes.  Changed SPACE-routine and added " K left" output to
screen  to  know, how long the specific floppy might last.  Added some more
"excluded" file-types and VT100 as the "default terminal". - Thanks for a
GOOD and FAST Backup-utility!

Here is an edited extract from the DOC file that explains what BU is:

BU.COM is a simple, but effective hard disk backup utility.  It will back
up most hard disk systems without any need for a modification of the .ASM
source code (although it has been provided if you need to change).
Patch locations are provided in the .COM file for your terminal's
clear screen control code or escape sequence.  Another patch location
sets the number of file types which you wish to have excluded from
backup, the file is currently configured to skip 7 different filetypes:

	PRN,HEX,SYM,BAK,$$$,TMP,BAD

The program asks which drives are to be used for source and destination
and verifies it before continuing.  It also asks if you want all user
areas backed up or just the one you are in.

The "F4" file attribute bit supported under CP/M can be used so BU
will will only backup new files (ones that haven't had the F4 bit set
by BU or some other utility such as NSWP which can set or reset the F4
attribute bit).

You have to be careful when buying 2400 bps modems (at least for other than
internal use where you can buy ALL of the modems) is that you get ones that
are likely to be compatible with what others have.  I noticed that the DEC
modem in the compilation in V4 #140 is a Bell 201 standard modem, while some
of the others are CCITT V.24 (not sure about this number) which are quite
different.

Bell 201 is 2400 bps, but half-duplex over the switched network (you need a
4-wire leased line for full duplex).  A venerable standard, but not
universally applicable because so many systems do not support half duplex
and syncronous operation.

Even being 2400 bps full duplex does not ensure interoperability (for
example of what can go wrong, look at 1200 bps full duplex modems where the
Vadic 3400 and Bell 212 protocols are utterly different implementations of
the same basic modulation scheme).

I don't know what standard will finally win out, but at least you know the
CCITT standards will work will most modems in Europe, and maybe here too.

Subject: MS-DOS // CPM-86 file transfers


We are in need of a program (or programs) to run on an NEC APC under
CP/M-86 and MS-DOS.  The programs need to be able to allow copying files
from the 'other' disk format (i.e. MS-DOS under CP/M, CP/M under MS-DOS).
Pointers to either public domain or commercial programs would be 
appreciated.  Right now we are using multiple machines and doing an 
RS-232 transfer.  It works, but is slow, and ties up two machines.

Also, does anyone know if the new version of CCP/M-86 with MS-DOS

Subject: KERMIT and USQ for TURBO Pascal

Date: Wednesday, 2 January 1985  13:00-MST
From: B.Eiben LCG Ext 617-467-4431 <EIBEN at DEC-MARLBORO>
Re:   TKERMIT.LBR and USQ.PQS for TURBO Pascal

Turbo Pascal is alive and well - here two major pieces in TURBO.

TKERMIT.LBR holds V1.1 of CP/M Kermit - using I/O byte redirection (currently
set for DEC-VT180 - but easily changed to other systems supporting the I/O
byte). ASCII (text) and Binary transfers supported up to 4800 Baud ! Directory
and ERase command, port-setting etc... Documentation included for the owner
of other systems.

USQ.PQS is the TURBO implementation of USQ - tested on CP/M,CPM-86 and MSDOS

Thanks to Jeff Duncan (LSM.DUNCAN@DEC-Marlboro) - who also promised to "bless"
the opposite piece SQ.PAS
				Have a happy New Year!

The above files are available via ANONYMOUS ftp from Simtel20:

Filename			Type	 Bytes	 CRC

Directory MICRO:<CPM.PASCAL>
TKERMIT.LBR.1			COM	 50048  447DH
USQ.PQS.1			COM	  5632  8F5AH

They are stored in ITS-binary format.  Questions on format to
INFO-CPM-REQUEST@AMSAA, please.

Can anyone give me instructions for screen installation of Turbo Pascal
on my ATR8000?  
Specifically, my problem is this:
	From the Turbo editor, whenever I do a CTRL-Y(delete line),
	the bottom screen border increases in size by one line
	in length.  This throws the whole display off. 
thanks in advance for any help given.

The archive blurb is a bit out of date on the location of that file.
It was moved to MICRO:<CPM.MODEM2>MBOOT3.ASM some time ago as part of
the file reorganization at Simtel20.

	I have a library in .IRL format that contains, amongst others,
one routine called IN and another called OUT. When linked with LINK-80
these are correctly read from the library and appear in the symbol table
but the instructions that CALL them have the wrong addresses.

	I assume that if I were to give them different names then everything
would be OK (other routines from the library link with no problems) and the
only thing about these two is that they have the same names as 8080 op-codes
but LINK doesn't know about those.

	Can anybody suggest what might be going on and provide a fix. I
don't want to change the names of the routines because I have a lot of
source code that refers to them.

While messing around with Turbo Pascal last night I typed in the
following short program:

|    program testvars;
|
|    var a : packed array [0..15] of boolean;
|        b : set of 0..15;
|
|    begin
|    writeln(sizeof(a),' ',sizeof(b));
|    end.

The result was that variable 'a' took 16 bytes and 'b' took 2 bytes. A
quick check of the manual revealed that the word 'packed' is ignored
in Turbo; packing occurs automatically whenever possible. It certainly
seems possible for packing to occur here. There is a compiler
directive (*X- *) which supposedly causes the code size for arrays to
be minimized, but the size is unchanged when I use this. It appears
that Turbo is tuned for maximum speed, not minimum code size. Sets,
however, use one bit per element, just as in UCSD Pascal.

Could someone try this on the 8088/8086 version of Turbo? I'm using
the CP/M version on an Apple //e with a Z-80 card.

While we're on the subject, has anyone received info on new compilers
from Borland? I keep hearing rumors of a Modula-2 compiler and an
upgraded version of the Pascal compiler. Any news?

Both the Micromint Term-mite and the Digital Research terminal boards
look to be reasonably good.  The Term-mite is about $250 while the
ZRT-80 is $129.... a significant cost difference.

Can anyone sway me towards either one of these boards?  Any personal

Look to the assembler instead of the linker.  Many assemblers will
quietly substitute the value of the opcode (such as IN or OUT) when you
use it as an address in an instruction.

Subject: TOPS-20 SQ and TOPS-20 MODEM

Bill Westfield and I were working on somewhat different versions of C
sources to SQ for TOPS-20 use, using different compilers.  My version,
based on SQU-PORT.LBR, a "portable" version, uses the "MIT C" compiler
and runtime package, and was completed shortly after Bill's
announcement, with Eliot Moss' help.

Although there are some significant differences in both versions -
look for an announcement momentarily, both produce files with a byte
size of 8.  One difference is that my version produces files with the
ITS Binary header.  This caused a problem with MODEM only - the other
CP/M-related programs for TOPS-20, such as USQ, handled this just
fine.

So, there is now a new version of MODEM (310) for TOPS-20 with
reworked automatic file type determination code, and which now also
happens to write ITS Binary files with a bytesize of 8 instead of the
old 36.

Source and a ready-to-run executable are in MICRO:<CPM.TOPS-20>MODEM.*
here.

For those of you wishing to try my version of SQ, you may FTP it from
SYS: here.  Sources are not quite ready for release yet.

As Bill noted earlier, both versions of TOPS-20 SQ are capable of
squeezing arbitrarily large TOPS-20 files (hopefully text files as
both programs assume).  Unfortunately, USQ/TYPESQ use file memory
mapping techniques which limit the size of the files that can be
handled.  (At the time USQ/TYPESQ was written, it wasn't expected to
handle but typically sized CP/M files.)  There *may* be a version of
USQ/TYPESQ available to handle such large files in the near future.
In the meantime, be aware of the potential problem.

I have had a ProModem for about a year, and have noticed that some of
the things that are mentioned in the manual are not true. For
instance, if the line is busy the manual says that the modem should
detect the busy signal, hang up and try again. This does not happen.
Also if you have the options processor installed you have the ability
to create logon macros, which I have not been able to get to work as
of yet. Another problem with the options processor, is with its
ability to send and receive messages at preset times, this does not
work either. When attempting to receive, it will answer the phone,
detect carrier and then hang up. Other than these problems, I have
been satisfied with the operation of the modem. If anyone has had the
same problems, and knows of a solution please send me mail. Also if
you have any other problems, send mail. If there are many responses I
will summarize to the net.

   Sorry, I must have missed this request the last time.  There is a system
called XenoFile, under UCSD, which is intended for transfer to/from CP/M.
As I recall (never having used it myself) it consists of two programs and 
three units.  What this sort of complexity is for, I know not.

   I believe it is available from both NCI in Vancouver and SofTech Microsystems
in San Diego.  Best thing to do is contact them.

   Funny thing is, there is a single unit from NCI, called PCDOS, which 
handles transfers to/from DOS discs.  Why won't the same arrangement work with 
CP/M?  I have no idea.

----------------

   I have Turbo on an 8088.  It's the same story.  Turbo packs to the byte 
level only; I'm told this is typical of Pascal implementations.  UCSD is 
one of the few that packs to the bit level.  I did my test in a different 
way: a case variant record where one variation was an array of boolean, by which
I wanted to access the bits of the other variation.  No good.  I had an 
array of bytes where I wanted bits.

   Yes, Turbo's optimisation is definitely for speed; I believe they state as
much.  I'm not sure, though, whether $X- is the right setting for optimised
arrays.  Are sure that's not actually the default setting?

   As far as I'm aware Turbo's sets are bit vectors.  I think (hope, 
certainly) that this is also typical of Pascal implementations (else why 
impose such a ridiculous restriction as a 32-element set?).

   I too am eagerly awaiting reports of Borland's Modula-2.  Having separately
compilable modules will make a great difference to me.  And with luck, the
reams of additional features stuffed into Turbo will be separated into
modules.  (Have you considered what the Turbo compiler's symbol must look
like, not to mention the code to initialize it?!)

Subject: Another TOPS-20 SQ/USQ Available

Yet another version of a TOPS-20 SQ and USQ is now available, based on
the "portable" C version, for ANONYMOUS FTP from MICRO:<CPM.T20-SQUSQ>
here on SIMTEL20.  These programs are meant to be compiled with the
"MIT C" compiler.  However, ready-to-run executables are available in
the same directory.  Note: USQ is a special version, not to be
confused with the more generic and significantly faster version of USQ
by GZ@MC in MICRO:<CPM.TOPS-20>.  Please rename this special version
of USQ to LUSQ (for Large file USQ) if you choose to install it on our
system.

SQ differs from Bill Westfield's recently announced version in the
handling of input and output filenames and input and output padding.
This version also writes output files with the ITS Binary header, a
known sore point subject to change.

USQ is different from GZ's USQ in that it will handle any arbitrarily
large file that SQ can produce; it assumes the original file was an
ASCII text file; it is more than three times slower.  It also has the
TYPESQ functionality by the use of the -count option for previewing
without actually unsqueezing.

Bug reports to me, please.

I just bought my daughter a Royal Alphatronic computer to do word processing
on - it came with a tailored version of Peachtext and Peachcalc, and it was
a good buy.  It's a Z80A, 4 MHz, 64K machine with a single 320K dual-sided
disk drive.

Questions:

1.  How do I go about getting Kermit onto this beast?  The disk format is
    not specified by Royal - is 320K on 80 tracks a standard format?  There
    is no info on what disk controller chip(s) the thing uses.

2.  If anyone has used this system, can you tell me how to put Peachtext
    files onto a diskette that isn't the Peachtext system disk?  If I use
    the editor menu option to save files, it doesn't work right - if i go
    to the top-level menu and try to save, it says I have to have the PT
    disk in the drive.

As always, thanks for any assistance.

	As far as I know,  there is no real "documentation" on the series
of BYE programs (but I'm probably wrong).  Kim Levitt's MBYE (Modular BYE)
program is a nice one,  and it includes documentation as well.  Most of the
documentation,  however,  is right in MBYE's source code.  You should have
no problem finding an overlay for the Heath.  For more information,  and
possibly a little help,  try Kim Levitt's RCP/M at 213/653-6398.  You'll
find MBYE files online.  Let me know if you need any more help.

As for converting .COM files to .HEX files, why bother?  I have
written an easy program which takes any file as input, and types
the .HEX output at you from the BBS.  True, there is no instant
CRC checking as with XMODEM, but .HEX files do contain checksums on
each line, so any errors will be detected eventually.

There are any number of more-or-less serious programs which will run a game

player, who uses one of the "card-counting" strategies?
 
I have heard of one which runs only on the IBM-PC, which configures
to any of the established set of house rules, and which will exercise and
evaluate the player's mastery of the playing strategy.
 
What I am looking for is such a program for my cp/m (Kaypro, actually) machine.
PD preferred (obviously) but not necessary.
 
I will summarize reply(ies) to those who so request (rather than burden the
entire net-readership).

No, but I *hear* that Turbo was actually written in Sweden, and is sold
in Europe as COMPAS Pascal.  I think Phillipe Kahn is >just< (:-)

No, I have no rumors about the reputed Turbo C or Turbo Modula, or where
they're being done.  How 'bout you, out there?

CPM+ incompatibilities...
  I am a happy owner of Osborne Executive owner... but...
Osborne did a bad thing... they goofed with the index registers in the bios
before saving them on the stack... something that is not sopposed to happen,
as some software packages (TURBO pascal for one i think) use the IX and IY
index registers without saving them before a BDOS call. ZAP! The new 1.21
rom availiable from osborne is supposed to fix this problem. When I get
this Rom, if anyone is interested I will research it. I do know that the
RSX i wrote works well for this purpose. Osbornes have given cpm+ a bad
name for no reason... IT IS 100% COMPATIBLE with 2.2, but some programs
such as public domain BYE does not work since the BDOS and BIOS are actually
stored in other pages of ram, so it makes it difficult to patch them.
An RSX is a Resident System Extension... cpm thinks of it as a routine
to run before entering bios. This is a legal patch that cpm accounts for.
The one I wrote just saves IX and IY on the stack, goes through to BDOS,
then when returning, pops them back off the stack...
Correct me if I am wrong please....

Kaypro Rom upgrade... look in Micro Cornucopia... for the 'PRO-8'
replacement rom. Sorry, but the newest kaypro board is not the
same as the kaypro 10. Kaypro is switching to basically 2 board types.
The non-K10 systems have the same board, at different levels of
population. (They all have capabilities to be a K4/84!! with clock
and modem.) The K10 board has been around as the same with some
rev levels, but same basic layout since the introduction of the Kaypro
10. Actually, having the new board is an advantage... look
on the back of the unit... you should have an unmarked Rj-11
(phone connector) socket in the middle-right of the back (looking
from front of system)... that is where the modem goes... If it is
a Kaypro 10 board, it will have 2 of those sockets next to each
other... on the left-most side... one is kayboard and the other is
for an un-supported light pen interface... but it does not
have the other 'modem' socket... 
  hope this helped

The problem is easily fixed.  In all the user overlays for MEX and
MODEM7 there is an equate that sets whether control characters are
passed along to the console in the terminal mode.  Look for this:

IGNCTL: DB      NO              ;yes=do not send control characters
                                ;above CTL-M to CRT in terminal mode
                                ;no=send any incoming CTL-char to CRT

Chances are yours is set to YES instead of NO.

I am running ZCPR (version 1) on a Heath H89.  I seem to remember
reading or seeing recently a scheme whereby the file search was
extended to include files of the *.OVR and *.MSG type, so that if
you were to be logged onto Drive C: and issued the command SC
(with SC being on A:), the SC program would know where to find
its overlays.  As it is, of course, ZCPR finds SC which then
errors out because it cannot find its overlay files.  Can anyone
help me locate the "fix" I think I saw?

Please reply directly to me (stanley at eclb), and I will
summarize for the net.  Thanks in advance.

iLISP is a lexically scoped lisp based on the SCHEME dialect  
of Lisp which runs on Z80 CP/M 2.X 

I have been going through some of the exercises from Abelson & 
Sussmans' STRUCTURE AND INTERPRETATION OF COMPUTER PROGRAMS (MIT
Press '85)--which is an excellent book--and having a lot of fun
doing so.  For $55, this is a really fun system for playing with
objects, packages, constraint systems, etc.  There are some
differences in this dialect and that described in Struct &
Interp, but I have yet to come across something I couldn't do
in a clean and obvious way.

Synopsis:
  Just like the big boys: read and run time macros, optimized
tail recursion (does not burn stack space; no [ugly] PROG or GO
needed), error handling and toploop fully user controlled, init
(startup) file, assembler interface, CATCH, floating point math,
CP/M access, assembler interface, list editor, TRACEing, BREAK,
user control of error handling, ramdom access function library
system (most convenient!), pretty printing functions, readable
reference manual (165 pg, + 60 pg intro for non-lispers), terminal
configuration options, full control of string and cons space
allocation, etc, etc.  Aside from this it is jus' plain fun to 
use (this is NOT a paid ad, really)!.   Warning: the intro for
beginners is much too formal.  The Struct & Interp is a much
better introduction for new lispers, who may need some hand-
holding in any case.  Unfortunately, no vectors or compilation.

general prims:
+ - * / ABS ADD1 ARCTAN COSINE FIX FLOAT MINUS REM SINE SUB1 SQRT
APPEND CAR CARS CDR CDRS CONS COPY DREVERSE LAST LENGTH LIST
MEMB MEMBER NCONC NTH REPLACA REPLACD REPLACAD TCONC GETPL GETPROP
LISTGET LISTPUT LISTREM PUTPROP REMPROP SETPL ALPHAORDER NCHARS 
PACK SET UNPACK UNSET ATOM EQ EQUAL LISTP LITATOM MACROP NULL
NUMNBERP PROPP VALUEP ZEROP = >= <= > < 

i/o and special prims:

FILEDIR GFD IOBYTE OPEN OPENP SFP ARGCNT ASCII BYTE CHAR ERR
EVAL DEFEXP DESCRIBE EXIT FREE FULL LOAD MEMORY PROG1 RECLAIM
RESET MAP TERPRI TYPE UNSETF

also has a number of macros and special forms (MAP functions, 
PROGN, DEFINE, SETQ, SELECTQ, COND, LET, LETSYS, etc) and a
bunch of utility functions (string handling, statistics, Eliza,
etc).  There is more, but I'm tired of typing and you get the idea.

As functions are full-fledged data objects, they can be assigned
to, allowing you to do things like generalize "+" to lists, eg:
(SETQ OLD-ADD +)	; expects 2 args
(DEFINE + ARGS (MAP ID ARGS OLD-ADD 0))
(UNSET 'OLD-ADD)
will now allow (+ 4 3 6) =>13 instead of an error (2 args expected)
and (+ ) =>0.

There are several info sources on ZCPR3:

	Z3USER.SI	-- a user's perspective of the concepts of the system
	Z3INS*.SI	-- installation manual
	Z3NEWS.*	-- newsletters about questions, changes, etc
	magazines	-- articles have appeared in Computer Language,
				Dr Dobbs, User's Guide, and others, and
				an article is due to come out in Byte in
				the next few months

The first three references are files stored in the MICRO:<CPM.ZCPR3>
directory on SIMTEL20.  Finally, a book on ZCPR3 is due to come out later
this month or next month.

Do you know of any CP/M based programs which will manage a
stock portfolio?  It should maintain a database for a
number of securities which includes, perhaps among other
things, the following:
    purchase price
    purchase data
    quantity purchased
    pricing history
    p/e history

Other items which would be nice but are not essential:
    plot graphs on a dot matrix printer
    produce a report of stocks which excede certain
	thresholds on price
    ???

The program can be either public domain or purchased
software.

[shift to the left! shift to the right! pop up! push down! byte! byte! byte!]

The IBM 1130 (a 16 bit machine, 60's vintage) running Disk Monitor
Version 2 (mod 10 July 1971) had a linker/loader with some
very desirable options.

My suggestion as to how to handle '$' in identifiers is to push that
problem as low as possible.  The 1130's linker had the 'equate' option
that specified the substitution of subroutines during the building
of a core load
form: *equat(sub1,sub2),...,(subm,subn)
	substituted sub2 for sub1

so 'C' programs would use something like:
	*equat(sys_read, SYS$READ)
This means that all references to the subroutine up to the link pass
would be the 'C' name (7 char maximum, per K&R).  Only at the link pass
would machine-dependent features such as longer name lengths and
funny characters be available.  Only- what name would stay in the
symbol table for the debugger to use?  This has the advantage of
moving the problem out of the 'C' language and into the loader
which I am under the impression is quite machine dependent anyway.

<< The following is of interest to systems that don't swap or page
  or are very memory limited >>

Yes folks, the 1130 supported overlays and in a painless way, that
was transparent to the coding.  If the program size exceeded available
core (yes - I said core) then the call was altered to call 'FLIPR'
which would read in the subroutine into the overlay area (in not
already there) and pass execution to the desired subroutine.
There were SOCAL (System call loaded on call) and LOCAL
(subroutines loaded on call). (There was a distinction between
system and user subroutines).

		memory was mapped as:
			+--------------+
			| main program |
			+--------------+
			| subroutines  | including FLIPR
			+--------------+
			| local        | size of largest LOCAL
			+--------------+
			| socal        | size of largest SOCAL
			+--------------+
			| common       |
			+--------------+

The linker would try the following in building a core image
1) build everything in memory
if it doesn't fit
2) SOCAL some of the less-frequently used system routines
if it still doesn't fit
3) SOCAL all the system routines
if it still doesn't fit
4) gives up

Now, just tell it what subroutines you are willing to have loaded on call
by specifying the option
	*local main1,sub1,sub2,sub3,...,subn
	where main1 is the main program
	sub1,... are the subroutines to be loaded on call

	If there was more than one main program (one passed execution
	to another by 'chain', similar to 'exec')you coded
	*local main2,sub1,sub2,sub3,...,subn
	for the other main program, and so on.

and re-link.  No need for recoding or recompilation.

	I see this as being very necessary for
running large programs on CPM machines
which are usually restricted to 64K.  Whitesmith's "C" has no such
ability, restricting program size to actual memory size.  Manx's "C"
has an overlay ability, but has to be explicitly called
by the calling program. (Aha! Now you see why its in net.micro! )

	Now for real fun.  If you coded a non-blank in column 26 of the
//XEQ card (that invoked the linker/loader) that allowed a LOCAL to
call another LOCAL.  This required special programming to pass a
link word [mainline program address] since there was no stack thus
all non-common variables were lost when overlaid.  This restricted
the LOCAL call LOCAL to assembly language only.

	Of course, load although not-called were called NOCAL and were coded:
	*nocalmain1,sub1,...,subn
but that's a nothing special.

	Rhetorical question: Why don't any of the 'modern' loaders
offer these wonderful options?  Let's see you run a Fortran compiler
and non-trivial program in 16K!!!!!


P.S. I have pieces of the 1130 all over my apartment, including the
	front panel.  Does anybody else miss the beastie????

When I first saw a TURBO Pascal ad (about a year ago), I figured it had to
be some sort of scam or at least gross deception.  I phoned and asked for a
review copy (I was writing a Pascal column for IBM Softalk at the time),
ready to rip it to shreds when it arrived.  Instead, I wrote such a glowing
(if slightly incredulous) review that Borland quotes me in their ads.  I've
asked Philippe Kahn about it on a number of occasions, and he just tells me
that it's a "simple recursive-descent compiler" and "I'm surprised that 
nobody else has come out with one."  I still think it's magic.

Does anybody know of any types of utilities to make a z80 running
CP/M 2.1 Unix-like.  I'm looking for things like full i/o redirection that
"overlays" over the CP/M like a shell (command interpretuer) that will
provide Unix features.  Someone told me about one called "microshell" but
I can't find reference anywhere to it.

 As the manual mentions, this requires that the switch on the bottom
 be set to enable this activity and that it will retry every 30 seconds.
 I have found both of these statements to be true. I have a modem 
 program (MEX) that will do redial so I disable this "feature"

I've just gotten a CPM machine, & am struggling to

to hack thru the system with DDT, etc.). Now I start
reading micro.cpm news & I hear everyone talking about
SIMTEL20. ( Sounds like a giant BBS? ). Would you
please let me know something more about this, how I
could access the files, and so on? If I can get stuff
from it onto this system, can I XMODEM it to my house
and so on? Thanks in advance,

I can't say I know what's wrong but I have been 
using Tubro with the ATR8000, and it works Ok. You
have to use TINST to set up the system for a TELEVIDEO
TVI 921 terminal (basically any ADM3a type). Are you
using Autoterm from SWP, or the 80 col. cartridge?
I use the cartridge myself, and I'd recommend it highly
if you haven't yet gotten something for 80 cols. Anyway,
that is a perfect ADm3a clone, so anything set up for
that will be perfect.
				Good Luck,

I recently snarfed the POW2 text formatter from SIMTEL20.  It works fairly
well overall, but it has a few deficiencies.  Among these are the lack of
various fonts support (you can overstrike a whole line, and underline
centered text -- whoopee), the treatment of centering as a special command
rather than as a justification mode, the lack of variable-space total
justification for printers that support it, the lack of a file inclusion
command, the lack of three-part titles, and blank lines not causing a
paragraph break.

I have fixed one of these by adding font support.  The command FT,number
switches to the font given by the number, in a table of font handling
routine addresses.  The font handling routines output a single character in
the routine's font, and they are printer specific (non-portable).  However,
so far I have only added this for left justification, the only mode I use;
any font changes will result in bad font-character associations in right or
total justify mode, and will have no effect in unformatted text (which I'm
not really sure is a very bad thing).  I would not want to release such a
program, but I am also not heavily motivated to fix it in a way I will never
use.  So does anyone else want to add this?  If you are serious about it,
and have a weekend to spare, let me know and I'll send you a copy.

Perhaps a number of us could work together on adding the other useful
features I mentioned as well.  POW has the potential to be a very powerful
tool; it seems no one has ever gotten around to making it one.

Some weeks ago, I snarfed the public domain screen editor from SIMTEL20.  It
was nicely done, but a three-mode editor was totally unacceptable to my
emacs-configured fingers.  I've hacked away at it heavily, adding many
features and completely replacing the user interface with an emacs-like one
(although it is not emacs-like otherwise -- no multiple windows, no
extension language, no marking yet).

The major extension that still needs to be done is extending it to arbitrary
file sizes.  I have worked out a scheme for doing this, but I was wondering
whether anyone else has already done it, with the new buffer module being in
the public domain.  If so, it would sure save a lot of time.

If not, then I have a question for you CP/M wizards.  Is there any portable
way to make a file shrink?  That is, to free sectors from the end of it that
were formerly in use?  If so, how?  I have not examined the CP/M file system
heavily, although I have hacked other parts of BIOS, so if there is a way it
shouldn't be over my head.  I need this because I don't want my temporary
files to be stuck at their maximum length.

I promised to report back; this is it.  I never got it where I could stand

where EMACS and my screen got too confused about who was where.

So far, except for Kahn's assurance that it is really simple, it seems that
nobody is willing to admit that they know how it works.  Here is a new, simpler
question:

	1.  Is anybody out there trying to figure out how Turbo "does it"?

	2.  Is anybody debating what it could do better, so that version x
	    will be even spiffier?

Here are a few of my own (somehat trivial) wishes.
  - A stand-alone version of the editor/run-time system.  TRUE FACT.  I use
    Turbo as my editor when writing in C.  ("Why?" is a lng story.)

 - A utility that will strip out totally unused parts of .COM files.  
   if, for example, Turbo loads all the trig functions into every .COM
   file, could a utility dtect that they were never used, and squeeze them
   out?

 - Turbo's random number generator is not so hot.  In paticular, it cannot
   be started from a particular seed.  Patches?

 - Could Turbo be patched to add a "true" complex type, and thereby save us
   all from those letters in BYTE that say "Real men use FORTRAN!"

Of Course!  First, someone (not me, sorry, I don't even know assembler) will
have to figure out how Turbo is possible, period.

thanks for listening

Subject: CP/M Standards
To: info-cpm@AMSAA.ARPA


Lastbutnotleast, I wish to send up a trial balloon, and see if anybody salutes
it...

People seem to keep asking, or even just claiming, that CP/M is dead. 
I think it is dead the way FORTRAN died about 15 years ago, that is, it now
lives in so many forms, and is "evolving" so much that it will probably never
disappear.  Notice that after years and years of fooling around, the FORTRAN
folk finally got up a "standard", first 66, then 77, and now so-called 8x.

Is anyone doing this for CP/M???

I know of at least ZCPRn, TURBO-DOS, RCPM, the UNIX-like "addons", and a lot
of different little utiliies for time-stamping, making USER 0 files public,
incremental backup, and so on.

Let's call DR's plain version "level 0".  For me, User numbers are nearly
useless in level 0.  How would it be best to fix that, and could we
standardize it, make PIP, ED, STAT, etc. understand it, and call it
level 1?  Could we standardize on a subset of the good features in EX, SUPERSUB,
etc, and add those to level 1?

and so on.  

In short, CP/M has a lot of good features, and some bad ones.  People add enhancements, but they (the enhancements) often interfere with one another.
This prohibits developers of compilers and editors and so on from using
the enhancements, and CP/M eventually dies.

I think that this is such a good idea, that I would not be surprised if it is
already happening.  I could be wrong.

One last thing.  I am posting this idea to see if there is any interest in
discussing it publically, so post you responses to INFO-CPM.  Do not send me
a separate copy, I can read it here.  Of course, if you have a
personal message to me that would not be approprate for the BBoard, you should
send it directly to me.

FILINK.COM is a protocol developed by Epson and is thus far available
nly on the Geneva and the QX-10 (it may still not be available for the
latter machine). We have promises of a generic FILINK program for
CP/M-80, but in the meantime, I modified Modem2. Recently others have
done likewise with MDM7 (both a MDM7 overlay and a modified MDM7
called EPXMD3.COM I think) and David Kozinn is working on a MEX
overlay. The files are available in the CP/M sig on Compuserve, or you
can send me a blank tape if you want a copy of MODEM2.

SQ now accepts wild-card filenames and properly handles ITS Binary and
TOPS-20 Binary input files as well as common ASCII text files.
However, if a file with a bytesize of 36 is not an ITS Binary file, it
blindly assumes the file is ASCII, even though the file may be
something else.

USQ (which should be renamed LUSQ to avoid confusion with GZ's far
superior USQ) now also accepts wild-card filenames and still blindly
assumes the output file is an ASCII text file.  (GZ's USQ tries to
guess the output file bytesize.)

Subject: possible problems with large numbers of open files simultaneously?

Does CP/M do strange things when many files are open and being written
at once?  I have a program that does this (six files are being written
at once, and are therefore open), and a variety of strange behaviours
occur, such as the disk write sequential call seems to return errors
(non-zero value in the A register) before the disk is actually full.

Related question:  the documentation for this op (whatever the number
is) says that a non-zero value is returned in the A register for a
nonsuccessful write due to a full disk.  Can this happen for other
reasons than a full disk?  Examples would be some flavor of write
error, etc.

When deleting a file, what if anything besides the file name (the
first 12 bytes, giving the drive, name, and extension) should be
initialized, and to what value?  Which should not be?

When opening a file for reading, same questions.  Does not closing a
file after reading it, either partially or totally, cause any
problems?

What is the best procedure for temporarily closing a file so it can be
read from disk in a different FCB, and then reopening it later for
writing, at the spot I left off when closing it?  I. e. I flush the
memory buffers for the six files I mentioned above, close the files,
and use a different FCB for reading them.  When I read it, I open the
file, but never close it.  To reopen the file, I save the number of
the last record, open the proper extent of the file, and restore the
last record number (base+32).

To initialize an FCB for creating a file or deleting it, I set the
following to zero: bytes 12 through 15, and byte 32 (offset from the
base of the FCB).  Is this the right thing to do?  Should I do this
much?

What seems to happen is at the time the disk is full, my program seems
to delete all the files.  It should only delete the oldest generation
(that's implicit in the file name).  It only calls the routine to do
so when the value returned from the write is non-zero.

If anyone can help me with this I would be extremely grateful.

Message-ID:  <850114073257.188287@MIT-MULTICS.ARPA>

Let me add two things to this discussion, which may or may not be
helpful:

The *equat feature of the 1130 linker also appeared in an early version
of the OS/360 "linkage editor", with the keyword CHANGE (If I recall)
and a slightly different syntax.  This feature has been carried forward
into subsequent versions of the related operating systems, so it was not
an idea that appeared and disappeared because almost no one found it
interesting.  Note, however, that as soon as one generalizes the
characters that can appear in some places and not in others, that the
linker (or whatever) needs special syntax, like quoting characters, to
delimit strings that might otherwise not be acceptable to it [either].

Although sharing some sympathy for the linker plan, I see it more as a
useful mechanism for patching things up at the last possible moment than
as a good solution.  A better solution involves seeing it as just
another case of binding the semantics of a name in a program (e.g.,
something that obeys the C (or whatever) naming rules to that name,
where the "external" form, whether longer or of a different case or
symbol structure, is just part of the semantics.  A near variation of
the problem that illustrates the point appears when you think, not of
"how to get a $ into a name", but about inter-language procedure calls
(or external (global) variable references of other sorts) where two or
more statically compiled languages have different rules about the naming
of such variables.

ANSI X3J1 (PL/I) had a long series of discussions on this one a year or
two ago in the context of languages that supported case sensitivity in
identifiers and operating systems that did not, languages that didn't
and operatings systems that did, and languages that had "everything goes
to upper" mapping rules and those that preserved case sensitivity.  The
conclusion was that, while it was probably a good idea to have some
name-changing and mapping linker facilities also (whatever that might
mean in a host independent way), it should be possible, for a number of
reasons, to make these bindings at compile time also.  Unless the
committee changes its mind (very unlikely, but I am obligated to say
things like that), the next version of the PL/I standard will go out for
public comment with an optional extension to the syntax for external
names, in the form of
    EXTERNAL (...)
 s.t., in a particularly bizzare case, you might write
    dcl sub1 external("avery_long$name_with_all_sorts#@%^&of NONSENSEinIT");
 what goes between the parens is, clearly, an implementation-dependent
and otherwise unrestricted character string.  It can even be a character
variable, as long as its value is known at transation time.

  It is also pretty easy to implement, even if only by preparing, and
passing along, a few instructions to the linker as part of the
translator's output.

  Note also that this type of approach permits either name (or, if the
capability is otherwise available, both names) to be made available in
the symbol table, since the translator has all the information available
when the symbol table is constructed.

    Enhancing the Osborne Executive Enhanced BIOS Version 1.1

     According  to  OCC,  their enhanced Osborne  Executive  BIOS 
prevents  a  premature  display of BIOS time-out  error  messages 
while using printers with internal print buffers.   This is  only 
partially true.   The delay value,  DELAY0,  is reset after every 
timeout to the value you supplied with the new SETUP command, but 
the initial timeout value remains at five seconds.  To change the 
initial  value,  I  recommend the following steps,  using  DU-V86 
which can be found on the -FOG/EX1.006 disk.

     Enter DU, logon to a disk containing CPM3.SYS, and get a map 
of the disk by typing M.  A typical map line might be:

A0-AF  00 CPM3    .SYS 00 : B0-B1  00 CPM3    .SYS 01

What  we  really want to know is where on the disk  the  CPM3.SYS 
file starts.   On this disk it starts with Group A0.   The sector 
we  want to change is 5 groups and 7 sectors or 2FH sectors  from 
the  start of the CPM3.SYS file,  or in this case,  it  is  group 
A5:07.  Enter:

GA0;+2F;D

to display the sector of interest.   CPM3.SYS will probably start 
at a different location on your disk,  substitute the first group 
listed in the map for the A0 in the above command.

     The last line of the displayed sector should read:

70  03CD2EE4 C118DF01 3A06E6B7 2008C5CD  *.M.dA._.:.f7 .EM*

If  it doesn't,  then you don't have the latest enhanced CPM3.SYS 
from OCC or you didn't enter the command correctly.   Look at the 
map  again  and  make  sure you have found  the  first  entry  of 
CPM3.SYS in the map.

     If  the last line of the displayed sector matches that above 
then  you have found the correct sector.   The  eighth  byte,  01 
above,  is  the byte we want to change.   A value of 01 gives a 5 
second  timeout,  I  changed  mine to 78H to give  a  600  second 
timeout.  To do this, enter:

CH77,78;W;X

DU  will update your disk and exit.   Reboot the system with  the 
updated  disk  and verify that the first BIOS timeout  error  now 
takes  much longer than 5 seconds.   If so,  you've now fixed the 
timeout bug!

I've been writing on an xmodem protocal in 'C' (to make it more
portable for me) and have been using XMDM-102.ASM as the referance.
I've looked at other 'C' programs already written but most of them
make an error in the protocal or are as obese as the assembler code.
That is they send a 16 bit record number, rather than the proper 8 bits.
I suspect that they were never tested.  Also while looking at the code
I noticed a bug in the WRBLOCK routine at WRERR.
It says MVI C,CAN, and should say MVI A,CAN.  I don't know if anyone in
this group keeps track of reports, but thought I might pass it on.

--cut here--

Zilog Z800 microprocessor chip quick description.

Hello folks out there in techie land, 

I just got in a new Zilog catalog and found the technical specs 
for  the Z800 chip.  I thought some out there might be interested
in a quick review of what seems to be a very nice chip.  Here  we
go...

The  Z800 family will be offered in 4 packages,  their  abilities
are:

1. address 512K bytes of memory on an eight bit data bus,
2. address 512K bytes of memory on a sixteen bit data bus,
3. address 16M  bytes of memory on an eight bit data bus,
4. address 16M  bytes of memory on a sixteen bit data bus.

Packages one and two are 40 pin, and 3 and 4 are 64 pin.

The chip is Z80 object code compatible

There is a 256 byte on chip memory that is configurable to cache 
or normal RAM.

The Z800 also has 4 DMA channels, 4 counter/timers, a dynamic RAM 
refresh generator,  a clock osc., a memory management unit, and a  
UART directly on the chip. (only the 64 pin version can access all 
features).

The  chip will support what Zilog calls Nibble mode addressing of 
chips, for faster accessing of RAM (I think Intel calls it Ripple 
mode, I could be wrong).

The bus interface could be handy for those of us who want to  use 
the  Z800 at the targeted 10MHz of the first chips Zilog will put
out, (25 Mhz later) even if we can only afford chips that can run 
at  four  or  five  MHz.  There is a timing control register that 
tells  the  CPU  that  Bus operations will be clocked at the same 
speed  as  the  CPU,  or  1/2 of the speed,  or 1/4 of the speed. 
There are also high and low  memory  wait state insertion bits if  
memory of mixed speeds is to be used.

There is an on chip single step mode.

There are 9 addressing modes:
1. Register,
2. Immediate,
3. Register Indirect,
4. Direct Address,
5. Index,
6. Short Index,               
7. Relative,                  
8. Stack Pointer Relative,    *
9. Base Index                 *
  * indicates new to Z800 (from Z80)

Looks to me like a super chip... can't wait 'till someone comes out with 
an add on board for my Kaypro 10 (hint's to those out there who are 
capable...)

Subject:  DbaseII errors

	Hello fellow hackers;
       

	Is anyone out there familiar enough with dbaseII to explain the
	"TOO MANY FILES OPEN" error message.... I've written a few menu-
	driven packages, and they all work well, except for the inter-
	mittent error of too many files being open...
	I'm aware of the fact that if the USE command is issued without an
	argument, all open files should be closed, but even this tactic
	doesn't seem to work.
	Is anyone aware of a different approach to this problem, or has 
	anyone found a way around it?
	Please send your responses to me at CRDC, and I'll forward the
	solution to the net, if there is one.

	Thanks, 
	JACK H. SMITH

YES YES YES!

Turbo Pascal is available for the following 4 operating systems:

CP/M 80 {8080,Z80}
CP/86     {8088/8086}
MS DOS  {8088-8086}
PS DOS   {8088/8086}

I'am using the CP/M-86 version on a DEC Rainbow 100
Limits under CPM/86
Source file block limit := 64K bytes if >64K use {$I file}
Code segment limit := 64K if>64 K required use overlays or chaining
Data segment limit := 64K
Heap stack limit determined by avail mem, no apparant limit
The compiler editor requires 33K of RAM

Check yu code to determine if you are properly 'RETURNING' from you
sub-menu or command modules.Dbase keeps a STACK of 'DO's that must be
popped by issuing a return. If this stack overflows you will get the TOO
MANY FILES OPEN error. Make sure you always return to your MAIN MENU via
a RETURN and not a direct call to that menu.

XREF250.LBR a "blessed" XREF.  It now marks symbol-definitions (a'la
the "real" XREF's) - and allows to get a XREF ONLY - since most
editors allow to "see" line-numbers.  I rearranged the code - took the
comments from the M80 source - and dropped it - it was neither
remarkably faster nor does everybody have M80 (otherwise he has CREF80
too).  Changes documented in source.

It is now available from Simtel20 as:

loop swapping. I tried increasing the size of the swap file to 248K and
making the delay count for swapping the max (2000), no help! Any ideas?

I think your "swapping loop" is just a question of waiting long enough
on initial entry to the file.  I thought I had that problem too,
because I lost patience.  I routinely edit files of 240 KB now, with a
swap file of 256KB.

You should be using the Digital Research MAC assembler (MAC.COM).
Z80.LIB is available from SIMTEL20 as:

Rename Z80-V3.LIB to Z80.LIB before using.  It must be on the default
drive unless you give MAC.COM a directive to look for it elsewhere.

Does anyone know of a public domain program to help read/write MS-DOS
format (written in Pascal of course), on non-IBM-PC type machines?  We
have a need to do this on just about any kind of micro with a 5 1/4
disk drive.  Apples, Osborne, Kaypro,etc...  The reason for Pascal is
that at least that much or it would be portable and the low level
stuff could be done just for that machine.  (Sort of like xmodem7 is
patched.)  Thanks in advance.

Oh, I have run across a program on a local R-CP/M system here called
RDMSDOS.C which claims to work on CP/M systems..  But I am in the
process of contacting the author before excepting it as Public Domain.
I will let you know if it is or not.

been tested under CP/M80 v2.2 and is expected to run properly under
CP/M+ as well.

Here is a short description of the changes from version 3.00 to 3.10.
Please use it until the revised document file, LU310.DOC is available,
which should be real soon now.

1.  Bug Fix in -Reorg to another drive.  Under 3.00 if you had reorgan-
    ized FOO.LBR from A: to B:, and there was _already_ a FOO.LBR on B:,
    LU would not have properly erased the old file, causing duplicate
    file names.  Yuchh.  I found this one by accident, rather than from
    a bug report, so I guess no one has ever been bitten by this one.
    Anyhow, it's fixed now.

2.  Change in reorganization logic.  If reorganization is done from one
    user/drive to another, the old copy of the library will no longer be
    deleted.  This gives some backup protection from Old Man Murphy.  The
    old copy will still be erased when reorganization is done within a
    single user/drive.

3.  I've hacked the directed I/O code to allow the -U operator to be used
    even if directed I/O (<input and >log) files are open.  This should
    make directed I/O more useable.  Leor's original DIO would lose track
    of the DIO files when the default drive was changed, so -U had been
    locked out in v3.00

4.  In response to user requests, a default library name will no longer
    be opened automatically when operands are being read from the console
    (stdin).  Instead, an error message will be issued saying that no
    library is open.  The default library LIBRARY.LBR will still be used
    if operands are being read from command line arguments, and no -O
    (open) is done.

5.  New operator -H (Help).  In response to user requests, a brief one-
    screen summary of operators, and the operands they expect, is now
    displayed by typing -H.  It is by no means an online user manual,
    just a memory jogger.  I knew it was time for this when I started to
    forget the commands myself!  Must be getting old.

6.  Version 3.10 still does not support the date/time stamping features
    defined in the new standard (LUDEF5) but now conforms to that stand-
    ard as a non-supporting program.  It preserves pre-existing stamps
    when appropriate, and will zero out any stamps which are made incor-
    rect by changes to the files or directory.	Pad counts, as defined
    in the standard, are tolerated, but not used, as they have no mean-
    ing under a CP/M-only environment.

7.  In bumming the extra space for the help code (the program is still
    under 20k on disk) I cleaned and tightened some of the logic, which
    may cause some cosmetic differences.  You may notice, for example,
    that the last operator used will show up in the prompt even if it
    was -L, -R, or -C, which take no operands.	There is no functional
    difference, though; operands will still be ignored by these opera-
    tors.

XLISP USERS

This document briefly describes my version 1.2 of XLISP.  It has nothing
in common with the previously released version 1.2 other than that it is
a descendant of my original version 1.1.  It will be available shortly from
the PC-SIG, SIG/M and PC-BLUE user groups.  It will be distributed in
source form with machine readable documentation.  Please don't ask to have
the sources distributed on usenet.  The entire distribution is over 200K

          XLISP: An Experimental Object Oriented Language

                            Version 1.2

                          October 11, 1984


                                 by
                             David Betz
                         114 Davenport Ave.
                       Manchester, NH  03103

                       (603) 623-3330 (work)


    XLISP is an experimental programming language combining some
    of  the  features  of LISP with an object oriented extension
    capability.  It was  implemented  to  allow  experimentation
    with  object oriented programming on small computers.  There
    are currently implementations running on  the  PDP-11  under
    RSX-11,  RT-11, and UNIX V7, on the VAX-11 under VAX/VMS and
    Berkeley VAX/UNIX, on the Z-80 under CP/M-80, on  the  Z8000
    under UNIX V7, and on the 8088/8086 under CP/M-86 or MS-DOS.
    A version is currently being developed for the  68000  under
    CP/M-68K.   It  is  completely  written  in  the programming
    language 'C'  and  is  easily  extended  with  user  written
    built-in  functions  and classes.  It is available in source
    form free of charge to  non-commercial  users.   Prospective
    commercial users should contact the author for permission to
    use XLISP.

    Version 1.2 of XLISP differs from  version  1.1  in  several
    ways.   It  supports  many  more Lisp functions.  Also, many
    version 1.1  functions  have  been  renamed  and/or  changed
    slightly  to follow traditional Lisp usage.  One of the most
    frequently reported problems in version  1.1  resulted  from
    many  functions being named after their equivilent functions
    in the C language.  This turned  out  to  be  confusing  for
    people who were trying to learn XLISP using traditional LISP
    texts as references.  Version 1.2 renames these functions to
    be compatible with more traditional dialects of LISP.

    A recommended text for learning LISP programming is the book
    "LISP"  by Winston and Horn and published by Addison Wesley.
    The first edition of this book is based on MacLisp  and  the
    second  edition is based on Common Lisp.  Future versions of
    XLISP will migrate towards compatiblility with Common Lisp.

Be advised:  Perfect Writer Version II does NOT run on CP/M, is NOT
based on Mince/Emacs, and will NOT work on an Apple ][+.  It is a
MacWrite clonette for the //c and //e, with pull-down windows and lots
of klutz.  Thorn/EMI, the record company who pretends to be in the
software business, is dropping all distribution and support for the
"real" Perfect Writer.  Sic Transit Mince?  I sure hope not.

A friend of mine discovered this to his great dismay when he ordered
Perfect Writer and got the "improved" version.  Now he wants to know
where he can get something close to Mince/Scribble (the basis for the
original PW) and so do I.  Any clues out there in netland?

	O.K.; so I didn't really make myself clear regarding the
	answer to my question about the 'Too many files open' error
	with dbaseII......

	The problem was that I was looping back to the menu by issueing
	a DO command when I should've been using a RETURN command.

	I guess after looping around with DO's, the dbaseII package
	was opening another file each time I looped until it thought
	I'd opened Too Many files...

	I haven't tried this solution as yet, (I haven't had time),
	but it sure sounds reasonable....

	Thanks for keeping me on my toes guys...

I hate to do it to everybody - and I didn't bump the version-nr either.
But using it - I came to hate my laziness in "flagging" references - so
I changed from ">> number" to "[number]" to make it easier on my "red
eyes"... since "visibility" is obviously dependent on terminal (or
printer) both LEADIN ( [ ) and TRAIL ( ] ) are EQUATES up front in the
source. NOT a change in functionality - so I left it at 2.50 (yeah and
I shuffled the source AGAIN to have main-code -> subs -> data ->
"once-only code" consistency (again only for the "next guy" improving
XREF).

The new XREF250.LBR is now available from SIMTEL20 as:

Please watch out for the file PATCH17+.lbr.  IT has appeared on
several west coast boards as of yesterday.  It has several serious
bugs in it, and a friend and I are in the process of helping the
author to clean it up.  The last version that really worked was 1.6.
Please remove any copies of any version of Patch 1.7 from the net.
The next (hopefully beta-tested) version will be 1.8, and will not be
released until it is relatively bomb- proofed.  This program has such
potential and such a nice user interface that we don't want to see it
ruined by premature release and thereby attracting an unearned bad
reputation.  Thanks for your cooperation.

There is a public domain blackjack program available through
Micro Cornucopia ph. (503)-382-8048.  ask for Kaypro disc K3.
I do not know the difficulty level of the game or if they even 
give you the source or not, but I do know the program is available
for the Kaypro.

Message-ID: <740@hou2h.UUCP>

To:       info-cpm@AMSAA.ARPA

Is anyone else having difficulty with Microsoft's Linker L80 when using
the search mode, that is, with a /s at the end of the file to be searched?
I am presently trying to use the linker with the C library of SmallC v2.1.
If I link the entire library with the compiled program, the resulting code
works just fine, but of course, I end up with a rather large program.  When
using the search mode, I get error messages that indicate that the linker
has not found certain modules of code.  What is a little confusing is that 
the modules that it is trying to link are not required by the compiled code
but are definitely present in the library.

Any suggestions would be appreciated.
Thanks for any replies.

Well, I wouldn't claim to *miss* the bloody thing, though I have fond memories.
Let's remember, though, that that 16K Fortran compiler had *27* (count 'em)
overlaid passes.  Things like:  pass 1 - lexical analysis of declarations,
pass 2 - lexical analysis of code, pass 3 - parse integer declarations,
pass 4 - put integer declarations into the symbol table (I'm making these
up; it's been far too long to remember what they were.  But you get the idea).

Tim, Have you looked into the ROFF4 formatter? It has all of the features
you mentioned plus some. It is on Simtel20 if you want to snarf a copy,
also available on your local BBS (Consult RCPM-057.LST for details,
not available in all areas, not sold in stores) It has the nice feature
of being able to define ones own font (assuming your printer can do
bit mapped graphics) and is quite flexible.

I saw microshell once, and was impressed by the similarity of the
user interface with UNIX's. It implemented pipes by redirecting
I/O through a temporary disk file and seemed to work fairly well
until you needed to change the disk with the pipe file on it. This
of course wouldn't be a problem on a hard disk. If I might make a
suggestion, look into the ZCPR3 package on Simtel20 or your local
computer BBS. It implements a rather large part of the Unix user
interface, adds TERMCAP capabilities, a nice shell package with
variables and parameter substitution similar to csh and some 
limited flow control. (If-Then-Else) But no CASE WHILE and UNTIL.
Still some pretty involved shell scripts are possible. It
does not offer I/O redirection or pipes, however the company
handling bug reports and distribution of a self installing version
,Echelon inc., have hinted strongly that their new version of the
BDOS will do just that. The best part is that if you can find a
local BBS that has it you can get it FREE by just downloading it.
That includes copies of a zillion utilities. It does make the
CP/M user interface usable, but you will need a Z80 to take full
advantage of it.

With all the hoopla about the various pros and cons of .5 Gbyte optical
disks, I thought it might be quite feasible to put the entire Simtel-20
archives on such a disk, in such a way that it would be easy to update.
There would be lots of room left over, and if they could be manufactured
cheaply enough maybe a series a archives could be established around the
country. I would certainly be willing to interface one of the Optimem or
equivalent drives to a CP/M system (I am aware of the logistics of such
an undertaking, with the restraints CP/M puts on file systems) and then
providing a place to put it where it could be called up and searched. 
Does this sound like a reasonable undertaking ? It would be nice if we
could get Shugart to donate a drive and some disks for the publicity but
even paying for it outright is not enitirely impossible. Does anyone
know of the single unit evaluation drives cost? Also, Frank or Keith,
could one of you give an update on how much space the MICRO: archives
are using ?

Chuck,

Interesting you should bring this up.  The very large capacity disks is
exactly what Echelon has been addressing recently.  ZRDOS2, Echelon's
BDOS replacement which combines with ZCPR3, addresses 512 M bytes directly.
Other features, such as no need for a ^C any more and an extended READLN
function (fct 10) are also present.  Interacting with ZCPR3, named dirs
over a 512M space become especially useful.  I haven't brought up ZRDOS2 yet,
but it is sitting on my shelf waiting for installation.

The directory MICRO:<CPM.Z3NEW> (a new directory on SIMTEL20) contains

	LRUNZ3.ASM	- a version of LRUNZ for Z3
	Z3BYE.DOC	- notes on using Z3 with RCP/M applications
	Z3HELPR4.EI	- a list of people volunteering to help others
			  with installing and in answering questions
			  about Z3; note that certain people specialize, such

	Z3EMX.LBR	- using Z3 with EMX
	ZBYE.MAC	- a version of BYE for Z3 use

These will probably be moved into <CPM.ZCPR3> at a later date.

The only problem with ZCPR (to me) is the amount of disk that you need
to get all the utilities us and operational.  Having a KAYPRO-II with
2 180K drives, I'd have no room left on the disk for anything after
loading all the nifty ZCPR utilities.

Ah, yes...Memories of my first machine....an old 4K 1130.
I miss it muchly...The techniques learned on that machine, at least for
me, predate any formal CS training, and are "instinctive" rather than
learned by rote...

We used to call SOCAL and LOCAL "cram and crunch"....and got around large
programming problems by making ALL variables COMMON.  We had large
payroll systems, personnel systems, even large linear algebra matrix
manipulations using this technique.

The whole concept of linking, speed trade-offs using core-image
loads, relocating programs.....ah, yes.....that was the way to learn!

We even knew if we had diagnostics in our compile by the sound of the
old 1132 printer....It had a different "rhythm.".....I remember talking
on the phone from home to a friend at the computer...in the background was
the printer ker-chunking out a listing for him.....I heard the
unmistakable tones of a diagnostic report, and told him he had better
fix his bugs and re-compile....He thought I was psychic!

[I'm new to USENET,so please be kind]

	Causing a BREAK without a break key is tricky since BREAK is not
a character but a line condition.  An active RS232 line (transmit or
receive data) is normally in the MARKING state (quiescent state)
(binary 1, voltage between -3 and -25 volts).  When a character is sent,
the line sends a start bit (goes SPACE, binary 0, voltage between +3 and
+25 volts), then the data bits (and parity if enabled), then a stop
bit (back to MARKING).

	A framing error is caused when the end bit isn't received
when it is expected, usually suggesting mismatched speeds.

	A break condition is when the line is put in the SPACE state
for the time it takes to transmit a character (including start and
stop bits) and thus cannot be confused with a character transmission.
Some serial communication chips will detect the start and end of
a break (since it may last a looooong time) and interrupt on both.
Others just give a framing error with 00h data.

	The UNIX Administrator's Manual under TERMIO(7) under IGNBRK
states that a break condition is a framing error with data 00h.  Non-null
data causing a framing error is considered a framing error.

	A break key causes the line to go spacing for about 1.1 to 2x
a character time length (usually a long time - around 200 milliseconds).

	Your trick of going to a slower speed may work if the software
treats framing error as a break (regardless if the data is 00h or not).
If they are treated differently, then you must transmit a NULL
character, usually control @.  This will be undistinguishable from a
break to all but the fussiest of receivers.  This also points out
that a framing error on a null character will be misinterpreted
as a break.

	I trust this definitively answers your question.  Ask anything
more technical and I will refer to the EIA Standard for RS-232-C
"Interface Between Data Terminal Equipment and Data Communication
Equipment Employing Serial Binary Data Interchange". So there!

You're quite right about ZCPR3 on 180K disks.  Some of the Echelon
newsletters talk about this, and one gives a breakdown of the disk overhead.
There is some discussion about reducing this overhead by being selective about
the features; overhead can drop to as little as 60K for some applications.
But if you want everything, there is a price to pay.

Subject:  macrotech board update...
To: info-cpm@Amsaa.ARPA

I have bought a Macrotech MI-286 from Gifford Computer Systems, whose
problems I described in a previous note.  Their recommended cure was
to upgrade my hard disk controller board from a Morrow HDCA-4 to a
Compupro Disk2.  However, a conversation with the techs at Macrotech
resulted in confusing information: Macrotech tells me that the problem
is most likely in the Compupro RAM 16 boards that I am using; these
are alleged to have a wrong pull-up resistor in R1.  They said that
the fix would be to put the correct resistor there, and all would be
well.  They also said that other Compupro memory boards did not have
the same problem, and that they knew of people with Morrow controllers
running Macrotech boards without difficulty.

I tried something else, with their concurrence.  I replaced my 4 RAM
16 boards with a RAM 22 board, and tried running the Macrotech board
with that configuration.  Here I had a very strange experience -- the
system worked fine in the morning, but then I shut it down.  In the
afternoon, I powered up again, and found that the system no longer
worked.  Closer investigation revealed that my hard disk directory had
been trashed in a very subtle way, and Gifford says that their other
customers with Morrow controllers and Macrotech boards have reported
similar trashing problems.

I have decided to take Gifford's solution, since they were 
generous in offering me some trade-in value for my Morrow controller,
*and* assuring me of refund if their solution did not work.

More as it develops.

	"Is anyone else having difficulty with Microsoft's Linker L80
	when using the search mode, that is, with a /s at the end of

There's a bug in L80.  When searching a library, it encounters a
module, and begins passing over the symbols to see if any are needed.
If it passes over a COMMON block, then comes to an symbol which is
needed, it gets a fatal system error in trying to back up to the
beginning of the module and begin loading.

This prevents inclusion of output from the Aztec C compiler in
libraries.  A work-around is to edit the assembly output from the
compiler and move all the common blocks to the end of the file.

I submitted a bug report to Microsoft two years ago, and received
acknowledgement, but to my knowledge they have never fixed this.

All of this applies to CP/M-80 version 2.2.

Key to understanding disk file I/O in CP/M is the fact that all of the
information about an "open file" is contained in the FCB, which your
program allocates and controls.  To open a file, CP/M just fills in
your FCB with the directory information about the base segment, then
promptly forgets about the file.  When you read, it uses the FCB to
determine which record to get, calls the BIOS to read it, then updates
the FCB to point to the next record.  When you cross to a new segment,
CP/M goes to the directory and fills in the FCB with the new segment's
information.

On output, the directory is not updated until you do a CLOSE or WRITE
to a different segment.  That's why, if you CREATE a file, WRITE many
records to it, then kill your program, you often discover that you have
a zero length file; the WRITEs happened but the directory was never
updated to record them.  On the next warm boot, all the records that
were written are reclaimed as free space.

	"Does CP/M do strange things when many files are open and being
	written at once?  I have a program that does this (six files
	are being written at once, and are therefore open), and a
	variety of strange behaviours occur, such as the disk write
	sequential call seems to return errors (non-zero value in the A
	register) before the disk is actually full."

I regular open dozens of file for input and output, with no trouble.
Since CP/M doesn't record knowledge of open files, there's no problem
with any internal tables overflowing (there aren't any).  Perhaps the
fact that the directory updates are deferred is fooling you into
thinking that the disk isn't full when actually all the free records
have been used up.

	"Related question:  the documentation for this op (whatever the
	number is) says that a non-zero value is returned in the A
	register for a nonsuccessful write due to a full disk.  Can
	this happen for other reasons than a full disk?  Examples would
	be some flavor of write error, etc."

A write will also fail if it's attempting to create a new segment and
the directory is full.

	"When deleting a file, what if anything besides the file name
	(the first 12 bytes, giving the drive, name, and extension)
	should be initialized, and to what value?  Which should not
	be?"

Of the first 16 bytes, set the last four to zero.  Actually I always go
belts-and-suspenders and zero all the rest of the FCB, but it shouldn't
be necessary.

	"When opening a file for reading, same questions.  Does not
	closing a file after reading it, either partially or totally,
	cause any problems?"

Just the opposite.  You should take pains NOT to do a CLOSE of a file
that was used only for reading.  This is because all a CLOSE does is
copy the FCB back out to the directory.  If you haven't modified the
file, this is an unnecessary disk access, and will prevent your program
from running when the file or the disk is read-only.

	"What is the best procedure for temporarily closing a file so
	it can be read from disk in a different FCB, and then reopening
	it later for writing, at the spot I left off when closing it?
	I. e. I flush the memory buffers for the six files I mentioned
	above, close the files, and use a different FCB for reading
	them.  When I read it, I open the file, but never close it.  To
	reopen the file, I save the number of the last record, open the
	proper extent of the file, and restore the last record number
	(base+32)."

If you're absolutely sure that you're not going to write (or otherwise
modify) the file while it's temporarily closed, it suffices to do a
CLOSE and keep the FCB, then resume WRITING with the FCB later.  This
is because CLOSE doesn't cause the file to no longer be OPEN in the
usual sense; all CLOSE really does is update the directory.  In fact,
if you have a transaction processing program which adds records to an
open file, it should CLOSE the file whenever it knows that it will be
idle for awhile (waiting for another line of terminal input), to make
sure that the entire file will be there if the system crashes or
someone removes the floppy.

	"To initialize an FCB for creating a file or deleting it, I set
	the following to zero: bytes 12 through 15, and byte 32 (offset
	from the base of the FCB).  Is this the right thing to do?
	Should I do this much?"

This should be enough.  But it can't hurt to zero the whole thing, just
in case.  I admit to what may be superstition here, but I keep finding
the "undefined" or "reserved for future use" bits in the FCB turn out
to be used.

Subject: Hard Disk Problems

     I recently purchased a CompuPro Disk 3 hard disk controller
to go with my CP/M-816 system.  For the hard disk, I found a bargain
for a Rotating Memory Systems RMS 513 10 MB drive for $250 at a swap
meet.  The drive's characteristics are 216 cylilinders, 6 heads (i.e.,
tracks) per cylinder, 9 sectors per track, 1K per sector.  Naturally,
this is all ST506 compatible.

     Not that I really want to bore you with all this; no, what I need
is help getting the thing to work.  I have had the controller card
checked out at CompuPro, and it works.  I have had the RMS 513 drive
tested, and it performs "flawlessly", according to the third party
who tested it.

     So, what's the problem?  Well, I set up DPB's and DPH's, and
the following would happen.  The system would come up alright.
Attempting to write to the hard disk with "pip" and the verify option
would produce "foo.$$$: verify error."  Attempting to write to the
hard disk with "pip" and no verify would successfully create the
file, but attempting to run the file would crash the system.
When I would bring the system back up, there would be eight or
nine (!) entries of "foo.com" (or whatever file I tried to transfer)
in the directory of the hard disk.

     Now, it could very well be that I screwed up my DPB's and
DPH's.  But, it's my understanding that *any* ST506 compatible drive
can be run as an ST506.  It would just use 153 cylinders instead of
216, and 4 heads instead of 6.  CompuPro supplies a bios entry
for a ST506.  Naturally (?), attempting to use the ST506 bios entry
produces exactly the same results.

     I am at wit's end.  I have had both the drive and the controller
tested, and they each work separately.  Running a format/verify/data test
from the CompuPro disk 3 controller works fine.  But trying to run
the drive under CP/M bombs.  Any hard disk wizards out there who
could be of help?  Please reply directly to me, as I am no longer on
the alias (I had myself removed right before I needed it!)  I'll
summarize any general info I receive to the net.  Thanks very much.

Subject: Large number of simultaneously open files
To: info-cpm@BRL.ARPA


Andy Klossner mentioned that you should take pains NOT to close a file open
only for read because

	1) It's not necessary
	2) Causes an unnecessary disk access

I must take exception to this; first, it's good programming practice to 
close all open files, regardless of their read/write status.  But more im-
portantly, multi-user operating systems (such as MP/M and TurboDOS) that allow
filesharing must keep a record in memory for each file; these systems release
this memory when a file is closed.  Programs that open a large number of files
without closing them (CRCK.COM is a good example of this) tend to cause the
file lock space to be exhausted.  This is an especially severe problem with
MP/M, where lock space is a fixed number of files (TurboDOS uses all avail-
able memory).

Closing a file open for read does NOT cause an unnecessary directory access
under CP/M 2.2; CP/M keeps a flag in the FCB that is set when a write oc-
curs (bit 7 of the S2 byte, for those who are interested ... 0=written); if
the file hasn't been written to, CP/M returns a successful close result,
but inhibits any disk update.		--Ron Fowler

The KAYPRO II video section was designed to imitate the control sequences of a
Lear-Siegler ADM-3A terminal.  For most commercial software, this means you
can "install" or customize the display characteristics by choosing the ADM=3A

choice of "ADM-3A" on the menu, the following information may help.

The following is a list of the KPRO II  "Terminal" attributes and control

I have been told by friends that a lot of software for modems requires that
your auto-dialling be EXACTLY like hayes does it, down to even the timings.
They say that people have used this in hacks and if the timings etc. are not
right then you are in trouble.  

I have a design for a 2400 bps modem which I think is Hayes compatible.  Can
anyone tell me of any software that sells in any volume that depends on this
sort of exact compatibility and will fail otherwise.  Note that my modem does
exactly what Hayes says its modems do in the manual.  I am looking for
programs that depend on ANY unmentioned pieces of information about the Hayes
modem.  If you point out any such software to me I will get you a 2400 bps
modem really cheap in a couple of months.

On a similar note.  Does anyone out there want to test out production samples
a month from now.  I should be worth my while to give you a free sample.
Thanks much for the help.				Sesh.

Can someone answer these two questions about the QX-10 disk format (380k is the

The BDOS (CP/M 2.2 and, I assume, CP/M Plus) is smart enough to not rewrite
the FCB if it's not been changed.  Not closing input files is just asking
for trouble if you ever upgrade to a multiuser or multiprocessor system.

Again, this may cause trouble if you upgrade to a multiuser or multiprocessor
system.

I strongly recommand that all files be closed after processing and that
I/O never be done to a "closed" FCB.  Closing an input file causes negligible
overhead.  Opening a closed file does require some overhead, but I think it's
worth it.

I posted this to net.wanted.sources a few days ago, but forgot these two
groups.  To all of you who are seeing it twice, my humble apologies.

I have a copy of UMODEM that will run on System V.  It's not the latest
version around, but it works quite well.  If you are interested in a copy,
send me mail and I will either post it or mail it to you, depending on the
level of interest.

Is there a method that enables program output to be sent
to the screen and printer??? Cntrl-P works when running
CPM, but from Turbo Pascal, it doesn't. (at least not on
my machine.)  Do I make the program a .COM file and use Cntrl-P??
Thanks in advance for any help given.

Rick,

    Do you think it would be possible to make a "standard" ZCPR3 bank
select interface? It would really be nice If I could swap out some 
of Z3 environments when I wasn't using them. It would also give me
back enough TPA to keep Mince from thrashing the disk.

I made a couple of changes to the ZCPR3.ASM file to make using the wheel
byte a little easier. First I added a Wheel Prompt variable (WPRMPT)
so that when you were enabled ZCPR could change the '>' to something
else, being an old TOPS-20 fan I of course use '!'. Thus, when you are
NOT enabled, and your prompt was "A:SYS>" , when you set the wheel
byte it becomes "A:SYS!", real trivial stuff here. The second change
was to make it easier to use my own system when it was in the "secure"
mode. Basically, the password checking facility on directories is 
defeated by having wheel enabled. Since I don't know how many others
will find these useful, currently the only copy of these changes,
(besides my own) is on the ZCPR3 BBS at (415) 489-9005, if there
is some interest I will send a copy to Simtel-20.

Actually, you can get a lot of benefit from just having Z3, the environments,
and a couple of utilities there. With the "standard" 1K overhead in
the BIOS plus the flow control package for really neat ZEX command files
All you need on your disk are LDR to load the environments, two environments
SYS.ENV, and SYS.FCP, IF.COM to handle IF's that the FCP can't and your
own DIR.COM. All told about 16K worth of stuff, and more if you replace
SUB with ZEX, no loss there. You get the benefits of multiple commands,
path searching, and a termcap for use when you are using some of the
other utilities. If you go over the list of utilities you will see a lot
of duplication in them, such as PAGE.COM and PRINT.COM, which are like
the resident commands TYPE and LIST. (more features but essentially the
same function) ERROR1,ERROR2,ERROR3,ERRORX are neat (you only need one
of the numbered error packages to handle errors and ERRORX to turn of
handling errors) If you use VMENU you don't need MENU, if you use 
SWEEP you probably won't need MCOPY, and if you aren't debugging or
something you don't need DU3 or MU3. Assuming you are the only one
on the system you probably wouldn't need WHEEL so when it comes down
to it, you really can everything you NEED plus some others for less
30K and practically everything with 64K. Not to bad really, especially
if it means you can get rid of some of the programs you currently have
on the disk, like PIP.COM or DUMP.COM. The only thing you might want at 
first but could later get rid of are the Help files for the utilities
you did have on line. I have a 180K  minifloppy that is nothing but help
(and it has space leftover) set aside as sort of a tutorial disk.
It really isn't as bad as you might think, the problem is all of
Ricks examples in the Documentation seem to have EVERYTHING loaded so
it looks like that is the Only way to have ZCPR3. This is definitely
not true.

After posting an article asking about Unix-like utilities for a z80 running
2.1 CP/M, I recieved several suggestions.  One was ZCPR3.  They all said I
could get it for free from many RCPM sites, but the last one around here
in Portland that I know about was Chuch Forsberg's.  It hasn't been around
for a while.  Anyone know of an RCPM site locally in the Portland area
with ZCPR3? How about the next closest site?

Try LAR.C under MICRO:<UNIX.CPM>.  If it compiles for your particular

Chuck,

	Re your request about adding bank select to ZCPR3, I feel that
bank select has to be implemented in the BDOS/ZRDOS rather than in Z3 itself,
altho ZCPR3 CP could use it.  We (ie, the Echelon effort) are not moving
in that direction, but rather in the direction of the Z800.  The Z800
offers a large memory address space, Z80 compatability, a higher speed,
and other nice features, and ZRDOS3 combined with a ZCPR3 for it are
on the drawing boards, with CP/M compatability be retained (hopefully
entirely, but the Z3 approach may have to be changed - still formulating).
Part of the Z80 compatability involves dividing memory into 64K banks,
so bank switching definitely comes into play with ZRDOS3/ZCPR3.

	I have no idea when this software will emerge.  ZRDOS1 is out now,
and ZRDOS2 is almost out (both are for conventional CP/M environs, tho).

		Rick

------------
In CP/M-80, the Turbo Pascal "filesize(filvar)" function will return the
number of records in the named file.  Each record consumes 128 bytes.  So,
the Kilobyte size is calculated by:  RECS x 128.  When the file is saved
in CP/M, file space is allocated in increments of 2K bytes.  The following
example will calculate the K's.
 
program find_k;
type
   filename = string[12];
var
   fname : filename;
   kfile : file;
   remain : boolean;
   i,recs,k,bytes : integer;
begin
   write('Enter the filename: ');
   readln(fname);
   for i:=1 to length(fname) do
      fname[i]:=upcase(fname[i]);
   assign(kfile,fname);
   reset(kfile);
   recs:=filesize(kfile);
   close(kfile);
   bytes:=recs*128;          { how many 128 byte records }
   k:=bytes div 1024;          { get the nearest k. oKay? }
   remain:=(bytes mod 1024)<>0;          { do I need another k? }
   if remain then k:=k+1;
   if (k=0) or odd(k) then k:=k+1;     { add another k for CP/M filesaves }
   writeln('That file is ',k,'K long')
end.

Subject: Reply to: cp/m standards


One thing that I have long argued with the system folk at DRI is for the 
DRI supported definition of a large number of additional OPTIONAL CP/M
calls.  I wanted them to define a few new BDOS calls, and a ton of BIOS
calls, all of which would be optional.  For an implementor to bring up
CP/M on a new machine would require no more than it does now.  But if
he wanted to add, for instance, support for a real-time clock, then there
would be a standard call for it, complete with a description of what to
return.  

I use this example because most all new designs support clocks, extra
ports, and the like.  But they all do it differently, even though all
are running CP/M.  

Key things would be:

  o Support calls for a large number of potential hardware devices, 
    including I/O ports, clocks, interrupts, and screens.

  o A 'configuration' call to return the system configuration (in some
    standard format).

  o A standard mechanism for returning a 'fault' or 'not-available'
    status.

So far some of the DRI people say they have been arguing for the same
thing.  Others are afraid a long list of calls (even optional) would
scare off developers.

 I am trying to help a friend upgrade his Apple from running with a
softcard to a Franklin Z-80 card ( same as PCPI Applicard or Starcard).
Everything seems to work ok except for MBASIC.  MBASIC runs , but
some of the screen formatting isn't correct.  In particular the home and clear
statements seem to be fouled up.  We have tried various combinations
of the "hardware" and "software" configurations under CONFIGSV with no luck.
I assumed that MBASIC was sending screen control equivalent to a SOROC, and that the terminal would be an "80 column card", a VIDEX compatible.
Can anyone tell me how to correct this situation by modifying "sftvideo"
or MBASIC itself?

Wouldn't the cp/m-86 and mp/m-86(80) system calls serve as a good
guide for extensions?  Clock support appears in mp/m, and even as
early as cp/m-3.0, the iobyte is abandoned in favor of a more complete
device control scheme.

I would also suggest the CP/Net (now DRNet, I suppose) networking
support, for the transition of a stand-alone workstation to a
file-serving network node.  Though cp/net wasn't successful, drnet may
have a chance.

Jim,

You might try to get in touch with the folks at Echelon.  They are VERY
GUN HO about the CP/M 8-bit world and would be much more receptive to
any comments/suggestions you have.  They are now selling a BDOS replacement
so one might consider completely dumping DRI altogether.  I talked with
the Dallas DRI rep a few months ago about some new CP/M-80 software and
he wasn't interested at all - "CP/M is dead" was about all he could say.
What I would like to have told that guy is that "DRI is dead" because
they abandoned the CP/M market they ruled and they can't begin to compete
with Microsoft/IBM in the 808x world.

John.

Rumor has it that they (despite Kahn's remarks about C being the

As an ex-DRIP (DRI person), lemme add my two cents worth.  Yes, DRI
has given up on CP/M.  CP/M+ is the last OS product that DRI intends
to market for the 8080/Z80 machines.  Instead they're out to try to
beat Microsoft with things like Concurrent-PCdos.  

I really find it too bad.  Not so much that they want to cover the
upper level machines, but that they want to 'beat' Microsoft.  It
means, that for the rest of their corporate life, they'll be copying
Microsoft and AT+T (Unix).  It's really too bad, because there are
lots of talented people in DRI who just aren't being heard.

Moral:  If you start a company, don't be 'market driven'.  You're then
a slave to your market.

More power to Echelon,
Tony ;-)

If it was done right, your RDMSDOS.C should work correctly on just about any 
CP/M system.  The author should have used BDOS call 31, which returns the
address of the disk parameter block in HL.  Since the DPB is a fixed size
across all CP/M systems, you now know where to stuff the information you have
about the MS-DOS disk format.  Needless to say, it's a little more 
complicated than that, since the MS-DOS FAT is somewhat different from CP/M's
FCB, but it's really not that complicated.

BTW, could you send along a copy of your C program if it turns out to public
domain?

<Here we go again>

Simtel20 is a site on the Arpanet which happens to be run by nice
guys who keep sources to many, many different kinds of micros, 
especially MS-DOS and CP/M machines.  Unless you are on the Arpanet
you can't access them directly (since it's a military-connected
machine, I wonder if they have/publicize their dial-up lines??).
On the arpanet, you can telnet to them an login as anonymous and
ftp the files you need (I believe they like you to do this at
off-peak hours).

When I worked at U.T. I could grab things (they are on the Arpanet
which is overseen or sponsored or somehow otherwise connected with
the DOD).  Now I'm at a uucp only site, so I no longer have access
either (not that this should make you feel any better, it just appears
to me that this is the boat most people on Usenet are in).  People
who won't be able to access Simtel20 keep seeing postings from Arpa
people who can and they get confused -- especially new ones like
yourself.  Don't feel bad, this question comes up all the time.

Keith (or somebody):  maybe when someone makes a posting about new
sources being updated, it might pay to have a short (paragraph) blurb
at the end about Simtel and who can access.  If it was kept around
and posted every now and again and at the end of all your announcements,
maybe these questions would be fewer and farther between.  

Or maybe you have a form letter you send people when they ask and I'm
sitting here being redundant.

King - every now and then we send out the SIMTEL20 blurb.  There really is
no set schedule when it is done, it just seems that we do it when the
interest is there.  Since a lot of folks have been asking the question,
maybe it's time to send it out again.  Therefore, for those of you
who have seen this before, please accept my apologies for dumping some
4 or 5 kb of blurb in your mailbox.  For those of you who haven't
seen this before, here goes:

"How can a user of a USENET host access the public domain
microcomputer software collection on the DDN/MILNET host
SIMTEL20" is being asked with increasing frequency as that
software collection continues to grow.  Unfortunately, direct
access is not possible as there is no UUCP gateway for file
transfer between SIMTEL20 (running TOPS-20) and a USENET host (as
there is for electronic mail).

(DDN, formerly known as ARPANET, is the Defense Data Network.
DDN, along with Arpanet, SATNET, SRINET, etc. are all members of 
a TCP/IP protocol-based, multiple gateway network called InterNet.)

USENET has been built on adjacent hosts voluntarily agreeing to
store-and-forward relatively short messages across the USENET
over dialup lines at 300 or 1200 bps.  In the past, helpful InterNet
users would fetch the file(s) requested and then e-mail them to
the requestor.  However, it has been pointed out that large file
transfers disrupt the service, delay the shorter messages, and
generate unacceptably large phone bills, all of which add up to
threaten the tenuous connections that some USENET hosts can
barely afford to have.  Therefore, we have been asked to
encourage InterNet users not to pass archive programs this way.

Now for the good news.  Some InterNet users, if sent a suitable disk,
will download files and return mail the floppy to the requestor.
To find a friendly InterNet user, send a message to INFO-CPM at DDN
host AMSAA.ARPA via net.micro.cpm identifying your disk format and 
your request.  Usually, someone will respond and come to your aid.
If not, don't be bashful, wait a week and try again.  But please
remember, any such arrangements are strictly between you and your
respondent.  This is not, repeat NOT, a service of either the InterNet
or INFO-CPM.

If the above arrangement is inconvenient, or doesn't work, here
are several other sources for public domain software.


----------------------------------------------------------------------

Information (and prices) are subject to change without notice.  A
volume is usually one floppy disk.


1.  CP/M User's Group

The CP/MUG volumes are available from:

  CP/M User's Group
  1651 3rd Avenue
  New York, NY 10028

Current volumes are numbered 1 through 92 at $13 per 8" SSSD disk
(Northstar format also available).  The catalog is $6.


2.  Special Interest Group/Microcomputers (SIG/M)

 The SIG/M volumes are distributed by:

  SIG/M
  Amateur Computer Group of New Jersey, Inc.
  Box 97
  Iselin, NJ 08830

Current volumes are numbered 000 through 172.  The first disk is
$6.00 and $5.00 for each additional disk.  The catalog is $2.


3.  New York Amateur Computer Club

PC-BLUE software volumes for the IBM-PC are available from:

  S-100, CP/M User Group
  The New York Amateur Computer Club
  P.O.  Box 106
  Church Street Station
  New York, NY  10008

The documentation files from the SIG/M and CPMUG volumes are
available in hardcopy form, grouped into "books", from the NYACC.
Each book is priced at $10 including shipping, $15 for overseas
airmail.  All orders must be prepaid.


4.  PicoNet CP/M Users Group

PicoNet, CP/MUG, and SIG/M software volumes are available from:

  PicoNet
  P.O. Box 391566
  Mountain View, CA 94039

Available in 8" and most 5 1/4" soft sector only at $6.00 per
disk plus $1.50 shipping per order.  California residents add
6.5% sales tax.  Quantity discounts are available.


5. Other sources:

Compuserve Information Service is another source of public domain
software. There are a number of special interest groups (SIGs)
devoted to specific hardware as well as CP-MIG, the generic CP/M
SIG, a repository for a large quantity of public domain software
downloadable by the Compuserve file transer protocol (Christensen
protocol is expected by late summer, 1984). There is no charge for
access to CP-MIG other than the standard CIS connect charges, and
Compuserve can be accessed through their own communications network
or through Tymnet.

Microsystems magazine periodically publishes a full list of
sources for public domain software in addition to those listed
here, with monthly updates/additions.

... and many Remote CP/M (RCPM) systems around the country, where
software is available for downloading for the price of a phone
call.  The May 1984 issue of Microsystems contains the full listing of
known RCPMs at the time of publication.


I would like to thank Dave Towson, Frank Wancho and Charlie Strom for all
their assistance in putting this blurb together.  If anybody out in InterNet
Land has any questions or comments about the above blurb, feel free to 
contact any one of us.

TURBOBUG.TXT follows:

                    ***** BUG REPORT *****
         ***** MAJOR BUG IN TURBO PASCAL V2.00 *****
                         July 1,1984
                    (updated December 1984)


     The runtime routines  do  not  handle  a  floating-point 
(real)  subtraction  correctly.  For  some subtractions,  the 
correct  difference  is  returned;  for  others,  a  zero  is 
returned. The following program demonstrates the bug:

program test;
begin
     writeln(9.+(-6.0));        { Wrong value returned }
     writeln(-1.0+(-1.0));      { Correct value returned }
     writeln(1-2);              { Correct value returned }
     writeln(1.-2:10:2);        { Wrong value returned }
     writeln(1.-2.0);           { Wrong value returned }
     writeln(1-2.0);            { Wrong value returned }
     writeln(456 - 123.0);      { Correct value returned }
end.

A value of zero is returned on those lines marked as 'wrong'. 
The other lines return the correct difference.



VERSIONS TESTED AND FOUND OK (December 1984)

The following versions of Turbo have been checked for this bug 
and are alright.  Any versions for same OS, with higher serial 
numbers, should be alright--but  use the above test program to 
be sure.  The bug may be unique to MS-DOS versions.

	Turbo  ver 1.01A for CP/M-86    serial #  1225
	Turbo  ver 2.00B for CP/M-86    serial # 49036
	Turbo  ver 2.00B for MS-DOS     serial #131821

(Comments  have  been  added for clarity).  This disassembled 
code is located in the  routines  that  handle  addition  and 
subtraction  (only the subtraction part is shown).  The error 
occurs when the routine tests to see if  the  result  of  the 
subtraction is zero. It tests for a zero by "OR-ing" together 
the five bytes of the mantissa (the instructions that do this 
are at offsets 1305H to 130BH). If the mantissa is zero, then 
the result of this "multiple-or" will set the zero flag.  The 
first  of  these instructions is a move of the word at [DI+4] 
to AX.  The next instruction takes the logical OR of  AX  and 
[DI+2].  No problem so far.  However, the last instruction is 
"OR AL,[DI+1]",  an instruction that operates on a  byte  and 
not  on  a word.  If the OR of the words at [DI+4] and [DI+2] 
results in a word whose UPPER byte is NONZERO but whose LOWER 
byte is ZERO,  then the next instruction, the "byte-wise" OR, 
will SET the zero flag if the byte at [DI+1] is zero.  Notice 
that the instruction at 130BH totally ignores the contents of 
the upper byte of AX;  the flags are  set  according  to  the 
lower byte of AX only.  This is what causes the error.


THE FIX

     The fix to this bug is simple: simply exchange the order 
of the two "OR" instructions.  This way, the zero flag is set 
according  to  a  full  16-bit  OR  and  not  an  8-bit  one. 
IMPORTANT:  Only persons familiar with the operation of DEBUG 
should  attempt  the  following.  Using DEBUG,  the following 
sequence of commands can be used to fix the bug:

     Assumptions and notes in the following:
          1) ONLY WORK ON A COPY OF TURBO!  DO  NOT  USE 
             YOUR MASTER COPY!
          2) The sequence of commands shown below writes 
             out  the   fixed   version   to   the  file 
             'turbo.com'
          3) Make sure that you have version 2.00
          4) 'turbo.com'   must   be   in   the  current 
             directory on drive B.
          5) DOS  2.00  or  above  is  being  used  (the 
             debugger in DOS 1.00 and 1.10 does not have 
             the 'assemble' command).                           
          6) Be  sure  to  verify  that  the code in the 
             compiler is the same as  that  shown  below 
             initially.  After the changes are made,  be 
             sure to verify that the changes  have  been 
             made  correctly  before  writing  the fixed 
             version out to disk.

OTHER NOTES ABOUT TURBO

     One  cannot  set  breakpoints  in TURBO using DEBUG.  It 
seems that TURBO  uses  the  breakpoint  interrupt  for  some 
hideous  reason.  If  one  attempts  to set breakpoints,  the 
system will probably crash.  Tracing,  however,  does seem to 
work.  The  above  bug  was  tracked down only after hours of 
tracing (by machine and by hand) and disassembling.

	A couple of years ago, I had a UN*X look-a-like running on a Z80
machine.  It was basically a V6 re-do, and ran many things faster than my
current networked Alti.  The software was Micronix and it was from Morrow
computing.  It rand on their Decision I with 1/2 meg of memory and 15
meg hard disk.  With a 6 mhz z80 it supported 4 users easily, and had CP/M
as one of it's shells!  It did all the normal UN*X stuff, i/o redirection,
background tasks, print spoolers, 'bout half the normal UN*X utilities.
But if you typed 'WS', it would see that wordstar was a cp/m program, bring
up the CP/M shell, and run WordStar.  It was written by a guy named rick 
something, and mite still be available from Morrows.  Ran about $500.

The MBASIC that came with the Softcard is a special "Apple version" that
is specific for the Softcard and will not work on the Applicard.  You'll
need the "CP/M-80 version".

Recently I was able to get SUBMIT to do exactly what it is supposed
to do.  How ever if I try to do exactly the same thing on another
disk, all I get is some 'whirrring' of the disk drive then the system
prompt and then the drive stops and that's it!

In the back of my mind I seem to recall an article about some
SUBMIT bugs - does anyone recall.  Thanks for any help.

This is going to involve a change to the BDOS or a way to keep part of
ZCPR resident while a program is running.

What I did to solve this same problem on my H89 was to disassemble
the BDOS and change it so that all files in user area 0 are visible
from any other user area.  This makes SWEEP painful, so I keep all my
files on A: in 0 and on B: I keep no files in 0.  Not elegant, but it
has worked for a long time.

Probably the only way is to write zeroes into the directory entries
( and then reset the disk system ).
But this involves knowing how those allocation block numbers are stored
in the directory entries, and this is really a mess.  The allocation
block numbers can be either 1 or 2 bytes in length (you can figure it
out), so there may be either 8 or 16 of them per directory entry.
Even worse, it may happen that there is not a one-to-one correspondence
between directory entries and extents.  A directory entry that addresses
two extents is possible, and then the extent number on the first directory
entry of the file will be 0 or 1, depending on whether the file extends
into the second extent.  The reason for this is that the field which
indicates the number of 128 byte records in the extent is just 1 byte
long, with maximum allowable value of 128.  Thus 16K is the maximum 
extent size.
	It's probably posssible to write the code to shrink the file
portably, but only if you have access to some of these other types of
CP/M systems for debugging.

I purchased Microsoft's M80/L80 assembler package 2-3 months ago and

Is there anyone out there that is running an ALS CP/M 3.0+ card,
SYNETIX RAM disk, and the SWEEP program?

I am not getting a valid number for the unused space on the RAM disk
when I run the SWEEP program.
I would really appreciate a copy of the source of SWEEP. Then I could
do what I need to do. I know that the ALS card requires the use of
CP/M functions 33 and 34 to access the banked memory.

I have one additional problem with the CAT.COM program. After I boot
up and initialize the SYNETIX RAM disk, I cannot get CAT to operate.
When I type CAT, the cursor advances to the next line and no further
action occurs. Does anyone else have this problem?

Subjuct: Using MSDOS Debug with Turbo Pascal
To: Info-CPM@AMSAA.ARPA, Info-Micro@BRL-VGR.ARPA, Pascal/Turbo^.X@XEROX.ARPA

It is possible to use Debug break points on a turbo pascal.  You first have 
to NOP an instruction.  I got this information from Borland a month ago
and have used it successfully several times.  There is one side effect.
You lose the ^C abort function once the patch is installed.

The patch is as follows:

In the CSEG of your program at
 
   Loc        Current       New
  0BE2          E8           90
  0BE3          DC           90
  0BE4          FD           90


This patch is replacing a   'Call Int21' with 'NOPs'


I hope this helps.

From: Michael Neary <MNeary.es@XEROX.ARPA>

-

Is there a library of stimuli that I can feed to the General Instruments
AY3-8910 chip to create special sound effects and/or music?  I just
acquired some old game boards using this chip, and I figured that I
should endeavor to avoid re-inventing the wheel while I try to justify
this purchase.

This particular design is driven by a Z-80, but libraries targeted for
other CPU's (using AY3-8910) are also solicited, since they would tend
to be table-driven.

Particular places I'm hoping for pointers to:

	App notes for plug-in cards using this chip for popular micros.
	(Apple? C-64? S-100?)
	App notes for computers using this chip (are there any?)
	Software (or tables only) for arcade games. 


I will be happy to share my results with all who request, so if your
reply is confidential, please so state.

Thanks,

I've copied the XSQ, XUSQ, and LAR programs onto our VAX (under VMS) and 
compiled/linked/tested them.  They work fine, but either I'm using them 
wrong or our copy of FTP doesn't do a BINARY (image) format file transfer 
properly.

I expected the SQueezed files to begin with hex 76 followed by hex FF, 
followed by a 16-bit checksum, followed by a file name.  But SMALLC.DOQB 
and SMC-ASM and several others I've copied contain something completely 
different.  Do I run LAR on these files first, the XUSQ?  Or what?

In-reply-to: Msg of 23 Jan 1985  12:44-MST from Ted Shapin <BEC.SHAPIN at USC-ECL.ARPA>

    DRI's MAC seems to change lower case in comments to upper case.
    Is there a fix for this?  Ted .

Yes, here is MAC.FIX:

TOPIC :  HOW TO MODIFY MAC.COM TO NOT CHANGE LOWER-CASE TO UPPER-CASE
FROM  :  IRVIN M. HOFF
DATE  :  22 OCT 82

     MAC.COM (by Digital Research) is one of the most popular assemblers
used with CP/M.  It has one feature that most people do not like -- when
making a print file (FILENAME.PRN) it automatically converts any lower-
case characters to upper-case.

     Neither ASM.COM nor RMAC.COM by the same firm does that.

     There are two ways to modify MAC.COM to approach this problem.
Changing address 165C from C8 to D0 will convert any lower-case source
code to upper, leaving DB strings and comments alone.  (1st example
below).  Changing 1663 from E6 to 5F will leave all the lower case
comments alone, will convert all DB strings to upper case, but will
toss out any lower case code that does not agree with labels that
are also lower case.  (second example.)
1st example:  leaves all comments and DB strings alone     
===================================================
 
1655  47                 MOV    B,A
1656  3A 05 30           LDA    3005
1659  FE 03              CPI    03
165B  78                 MOV    A,B
165C  C8                 RZ

     Change the RZ (C8) to a RNC (D0)

                   Using DDT or SID:

165C  C8 D0

A>SAVE 46 MAC.COM

      This will convert any source code not in a string from lower to
upper, and not bother any comment areas or DB strings.  It's as close
as you can get easily, to leaving all lower case alone. 

2nd example:  leaves all comments alone, but throws out lower case
              source code including strings that do not match.
===================================================
1663  E6 5F                  (ANI  5FH)

                   Using DDT or SID, change to:

1663  E6 7F                  (ANI  7FH)

A>SAVE 46 MAC.COM            (new, normal version)


     This prevents the lower-case from being changed to upper-case.
For a complete disassembly of that area:


1655  47        MOV   B,A      ;Put the char. into 'B' temporarily
1656  3A 05 30  LDA   ABORT    ;See any request to quit
1659  FE 03     CPI   03
165B  78        MOV   A,B      ;Get the char. back again
165C  C8        RZ             ;Exit with the char. if a 03
165D  FE 61     CPI   61H      ;Less than lower-case alpha char.?
165F  D8        RC             ;If less, ignore
1660  FE 7B     CPI   7AH+1    ;More than lower-case alpha char.?
1662  D0        RNC            ;If more, ignore
1663  E6 5F     ANI   5FH      ;Otherwise change to upper-case
1665  C9        RET            ;Finished

     Back in high school, we had an IBM 1620 that was just as old
as I was.  Someone had discovered that if you put an AM radio on
the console near the typewriter, and tuned to the low end of the
AM dial, you could hear all sorts of interesting noises.  We never
did figure out what caused them, but one guy wrote a program that
would play songs, and after a while, you could tell what the
computer was doing by the sounds it was making.  It was lots of
fun to be able to tell innocent bystanders "the printer will start
in five seconds", and then have it happen.

fascinating.  One of the real difficulties is that there are
KNOWN bugs in the B-step revs of the 80286 chip; so many that
CompuPro refuses to sell a 286 board except for "development",
and warns users.  Macrotech and Gifford think they have fixed or
wired around all the problems, and perhaps they have, although
your strange experiences make one wonder.
	Dual processors were a great idea in their time.  After
some thought, though, I am converting my system to a new
CompuPro 80286/287 board (as of now they are shipping the C-step
80286 chip, which doesn't have the problems of the b step) and a
Z-80 SPUZ slave Z-80 p[rocessor.  This will run both processors
at once, and if fed a z-80 .com file that runs and the 286 is
available for other simultaneous work.  Seems more advanced than
a dual processor.  But I will also keep a vanilla z-80 around to
write books with until I'm sure...

This wonderful piece of software has 10 pages of documentation!
I believe the problem is in the order of your modules.  I am just
guessing but this happened to me once, so I ordered the modules
so the linker doesn't have to back-up.  If a function in one module
calls a function in another module, the caller must come before the
called function.   Good luck, you'll need it.

There is another temporary fix... just ask L80 to search the library twice (or
more) by doing "foolib/s,foolib/s".  L80 doesn't know how to backup, but you
can tell it to search as many times as necessary to pick up backward
references.

I have developed and someday soon (hopefully) will market a S-100 card
with two AY-3-8910s, joysticks, tracballs, clock/calander w/battery
backup, and SSI-263 high tech Speech Synthesizer.  I have demo programs
in ZBASIC (Zenith Z-100) to drive all the sounds (these came from the
AY.. Data Sheets) and MUSIC (I wrote a sheet music hand encoded data
cruncher to AY.. program to pump the AYs with mindblowing music.
I hand encoded Star Wars and the rest I converted from the SIG/M Music-
Composer Data (device used CP/M CPU intensive 4 D/A converters) to
my more humanlly readable data format.  I think they are SIG/M volumes
66-69 (3 disks) +/- a number.  You can get it by FTP from SIMTEL-20.

Unfortunately, I can not release my programs (they are not the greatest
anyway as I know very little about Music) until my device comes to
market and copyrights are canned.

The AY-3-8910 Data Manual is a must if you are to do anything worthwhile
with them.   It also contains equations for register values for a wanted
frequency, wave form stuff and most important a table of all the notes
on a piano and the freq to several places.  I can upload this for you
as I'd hate to have another person on earth have to type it in again.

If you or anyone has any other info on using the AY-3-8910, have any
interesting noises, and/or any computer format music/song data for
any computer music devices please let me in on it.   Thanx

Cheers,
Gern

I had the opportunity to use Microshell for several months
a couple of years ago, and it was generally great.  The only
difficulty arose with programs compiled using a C compiler
that incorporated code for command-line arguments and
I/O redirection.  Microshell and the C programs never could
seem to agree on who was going to do the redirection, with
the usual result that stuff went in all sorts of strange
directions....

Subj: PUBlic filetype patch for CP/M 2.2 - official version


PUBPATCH is a CP/M 2.2 BDOS patch that implements the PUBlic file
attribute (bit 7 of 2nd character of a filename) and makes a file with
the PUBlic attribute assessible from any user number.  PUBlic files
allows a single copy of "associated files" -- libraries, databases,
overlays, swap files, etc -- to serve all user numbers.  They retain
their other attributes and may therefore be read/write as well as
read/only.

Complete documentation of PUBlic files appears in "CP/M 2.2 Goes
Public", by Bridger Mitchell and Derek McKay, Plu*Perfect Systems, Dr.
Dobb's Journal, Nov. 1984.  Limited documentation is included in the
preamble of PUBPATCH.ASM, and supporting files and installation are
described in PUBLIC.DOC.

Some earlier releases by others, available on some RCPM systems, that
attempt to implement a similar patch are reporting differing degrees
of success.  To cut through any confusion, I've sent Keith Petersen
the Plu*Perfect Systems release disk, and he's uploaded it to
SIMTEL20.  Keith has removed the earlier versions - only the
"official" versions of the files remain and are listed below.  Note
that some "unofficial" versions were also called "PUBPATCH.ASM".

The patch can be installed in Z80 systems running standard CP/M 2.2
using RELPUBLC.COM to relocate PUBPATCH.HXR (a hex-relocatable version
of PUBPATCH).  The squeezed source file is PUBPATCH.AQM.

SD.COM (with SD.DOC) are SuperDirectory extended to support display of
PUBlic files.  DISK7P.COM (with DISK7P.DOC) is the extended file-
maintenance utility DISK7.

The PUBLIC.COM and PUBLIC.AQM file is v 1.1.  It corrects a bug in the
published source v 1.0, which failed to set the PUBlic attribute bit
for very long files that overflowed the extent count into the S2
directory byte.

Restrictions, documented in LICENSE.NOT, are summarized here:

PUBPATCH.ASM, PUBLIC.ASM, and derivative files RELPUBLC.COM and
PUBPATCH.HXR, are copyrighted by Plu*Perfect Systems.  Permission is

	In order to print output to both the screen and the line
printer in Turbo Pascal under CP/M you must include a second
writeln statement which directs its output to the Lst device.
For example, to print the string 'Hello There!' on both the
screen and printer, you would include the following lines in
your program:

	writeln ('Hello There!'); { print on screen }
	writeln (Lst,'Hello There!'); { print on printer }

	This is discussed beginning in section 14.5, Text Files,
of my Turbo manual.  There is a program with examples in 
section 14.5.1, and a description of the logical devices given
in section 14.5.2.

Message-Id: <1985.01.25.15.09.57.630.03354@Dione.rice>

Does anyone have a UNIX utility to manipulate SS SD 8" CP/M floppies
under UNIX?  I have a bare-bones program capable of extracting files.
It cannot, however, write on the floppies, nor can it deal with
attribute bits or CP/M+ file system extensions.

If no such program is conveniently available, could someone point me
towards the information necessary to write one of my own?  My CP/M
manuals don't seem to contain quite enough information.

I too am new to the net news and have not been able to find out
how to access SIMTEL20!!  I see people talking about many programs
I would love to try.

Can I access SIMTEL20, and if so HOW??

I work at AT&T Teletype Corp., Skokie, IL

Thanks to all who replied to my problem with SUBMIT.  The problem was
an unwanted blank line at the end of the '.SUB' file.  That sure kills 
the operation cold...

Found that the screen editor I use ('scope' from Vector Graphic) adds
a blank line at the end of the file if I use the 'insert' mode, but
not if I use the 'append' mode.  I can now watch for that problem and 
have perfect results every time.

  It certainly would be nice if scribble were released to the public domain.
A lot of Kaypro owners have Perfect Writer/Perfect Formatter, which are 
clones of Mince/Scribble.  But unlike Scribble, P. Formatter did not 
come with source code, and so Kaypro owners have not been able to customize
the formatting to their likes and needs.  (Or was it just Mince that 
came with source?)

Subject:  MDM730 Overlay for Ithaca Intersystems VIO board with 2661 USART
To: info-cpm@Amsaa.ARPA
Cc: treid@Mitre.ARPA

Help:

I have an Ithaca Intersystems 525 (or 800) system with a VIO board that
has a 2661 USART on it.  The system is 3 years old.  The M7VIO-1.ASM
overlay for MDM730 is for the 2651 and, needless to say, doesn't work.
The initialization is wrong (comes up 300 baud, not 1200, etc.) and
when this is circumvented via a built-in terminal mode, every 10th-50th
character is duplicated in MDM730 terminal mode.

Solutions sought in order of desire:  (1) someone who has brought up 
modem7 on an II 525/800 and can help this lost soul, (->3) information
on the care, feeding, initialization, and I/O on the 2661, (<-2) another
M7 overlay, and finally (4) kind thoughts for one who will never enjoy
the pleasures of MDM730.

Thanks for all.  Tom.

Easy??  Well, not really.  To get a directory listing, you have to set
up the File Control Block (FCB) and call BDOS functions 11h (search for
first) and 12h (search for next).  In this example, bytes 0 to 11 will
be used in setting up the FCB.  Byte 0 is the drive number to access,
bytes 1 to 8 is the file name, and bytes 9 to 11 is the file type.  
Since we're searching the entire directory, fill the bytes for name and
type with 3Fh (questionmark) for *all* files.  When calling BDOS 11h,
if a file is found, the Direct Memory Address (DMA) is filled with the
record (128 bytes) containing the directory entry and returns a value
(0,1,2,3) indicating the starting position (each record contains 4
filenames of 32 bytes each).  Calling BDOS 12h continues the search in
the directory until no more files are found.  Something like this will
do the job:
 
program directory;
 
const                     { CP/M-80 BDOS calls }
  search_first = $0011;
  search_next = $0012;
  set_DMA  = $001A;
 
var
   first : boolean;
   i,directory_code : integer;
   DMA : array[1..128] of byte;
   FCB : array[0..11] of byte absolute $005C;
       { location of File Control Block }
 
procedure next;
   var
      ch : char;
      starting_position : integer;
      name : string[12];
   begin
      name := '';
      starting_position := directory_code * 32;     { get start of next file }
      for i:= starting_position + 1 to starting_position + 11 do
         begin
            ch := char(mem[addr(DMA) + i]);
            if i = starting_position + 9 then name := name + '.' + ch
               else name := name + ch
         end;
      writeln(name);
   end;
 
begin
   bdos(set_DMA,addr(DMA));     { allocate a record of memory for the DMA }
   FCB[0] := 0;     { drive # to access:  0 = A, 1 = B, ...}
   for i := 1 to 11 do      { fill FCB with '?'s to match all files }
      FCB[i] := $3F;
   first := true;
   repeat
      { get directory_code of file given by the FCB }
      if first then
         directory_code := bdos(search_first,addr(FCB))
      else
         directory_code := bdos(search_next);     { continue search }
      first := false;
      if directory_code <> $FF then next;     { file present? }
   until directory_code = $FF;     { no more files }
end.

Because of the good documentation and careful construction of Turbo-Pascal
it is possible to make it do almost anything you wish.  For instance if
you really want to echo all console output to the printer the following
program will do it.  The information needed to set it up can be found in 
the Turbo Pascal manual in section A.12 for CPM systems and B2.3 for 8086
based systems.

         Program ControlpTest;
         
         Var
            Ch : Char;
            SaveAddress : Integer;

         Procedure PWrite (Ch : Char);
         Var
            CB : Byte Absolute Ch;
         
         Begin {PWrite}
         Bios (4, CB);
         Bios (3, CB);
         End; {PWrite}
         
         
         Begin {ControlpTest}
         SaveAddress := ConOutPtr;      {Save address of default routine}
         ConOutPtr := Addr (PWrite);    {turn on printer echo}   
         Read (Kbd, Ch);
         While Ch <> ^Z Do              {test the echo until control-Z}
            Begin
            Write (Ch);
            Read (Kbd, Ch);
            End;
         ConOutPtr := SaveAddress;      {turn off printer echo}
         End.

If you really want to simulate control-P in all its glory then simply patch
into the console input routine in a similar fashion (ConInPtr := address of
your own Procedure).  Your procedure can then scan all console input for a 
control-P and turn the echo on or off as shown above.

I hope this technique is useful to some of you.

Another possible solution for those who insist on downgrading
their CP/M systems to UNIX :-) was/is Cromemco's CROMIX.
It ran on their S-100 machines with a Z-80 and 128K min of
RAM. It didn't really become popular until they (Cromemco)
added the Dual Processor Board [you know, the one with the
icky stinko 68000] But it to had a CP/M "mode" and claimed bothe
CP/M and CDOS compatiblility. Not to slow either.

[scribble has gone the way of the line eater bug]

I gave Mark of the Unicorn a call this morning.  I was seeking an
update to a program we bought from them 3 years ago called scribble.
It was a word processing package patterned after scribe.  The version
we have is v1.3 and I know that at one time they were selling v1.4
which had bug fixes and enhancements.  However, a very nice girl
from MOTU informed me that scribble is a non-product and that there
are no updates possible.  I asked her about v1.4 and she said go
ahead and get it any way possible.  Does anyone out there have v1.4?
I would be willing to pay for media and postage to any kind soul
who can help me out.

P.S. Maybe we should ask MOTU to donate scribble to the Public Domain
     since they have no further interest in it?

The submitted algorithm has some misleading information and at least one flaw
outright: Files CAN be empty, taking up zero K on the disk. The misleading part
is that not ALL CP/M systems allocate 2k at a time; mine (Osborne DD) allocates
only 1K.  This is nice since you waste at most 1023 bytes (as opposed to 2047
in the worst case of 2K clusters), but it is NOT nice in that reading a file
>16K causes a seek back to the directory to open another extent, whereas this
would only happen every 32K with 2K allocations.

yes, i do have a copy of kermit that will run on an apple.  but it is

the source is ~ 176K. and the library file for kermit is ~ 360K.  if you
send me a disc i will give you the 'com' file configured for the 
micromodem(i think it sould run at 300 baud just fine) or if your machine
has uuencode/uudecode i will send you a copy of the 'com' file through mail.
you are welcome to the sources but i don't think you have the disc space
to accommonate the source file for kermit let alone assemble it!

The problem with submit is documented in the cpm manual.  "If the submit
function is performed on any disk other than drive A, the commands are not
processed until the disk is inerted into drive A and the system reboots."

The problem is that the $$$.SUB file is created on B:, say, but the CCP
looks only on A: for it.  There is a patch which fixes it and is easy to
apply - I might be able to dig it out for you if you send me mail, but
it would take a while, since now I use ZEX exclusively (you could use
ZEX or EX - they are memory-based submt type programs).

A friend of mine has posed a question concerning CP/M which
is beyond my competence, so I'm hoping someone out there can
provide an answer.  The problem runs as follows:

He has a system consisting of an Apple //e, an Advanced Logic
Systems CP/M Card, and an Epson RX-80 printer (the printer
interface card is, I believe, a standard Apple Centronics card).
The version of CP/M being used is 3.01B1.  Whenever he attempts
to get a hardcopy of the file, the text always comes out double
spaced on the printer.  I came up with a band-aid solution to this
by writing a short Applesoft Basic program which set the printer
default line spacing to half normal.

The question we're trying to answer is this:
A) Are there any system parameters or switches inside the CP/M
   operating system which can be changed to cure this double spacing
   problem?  Apparently CP/M is sending a line feed with each carriage
   return, and the printer is happily appending a line feed after the
   carriage return also.  Anyway, we don't want to change the dip
   switches inside the Epson, since other software depends on them,
   so is there a way to stop CP/M from sending its own line feed?

B) If the answer to A) is no, then we would like to find out how to set
   up a 'PROFILE.SUB' file to perform the same actions as the Applesoft
   program.  Those actions are:
	--print a message to the screen to turn on the printer,
	  and then press a key
	--wait for a keypress
	--establish a data channel to the printer (PR#1 in Applesoft)
	--send the appropriate control characters to the printer
	  (ESC-@-CR-ESC-A-ACK-CR)
	--close the data channel (PR#0)

   I've speculated that the last 3 steps could be performed by:
	DEVICE CONOUT: = LPT
	TYPE SETUP.DAT
	DEVICE CONOUT: = CRT
   where SETUP.DAT contains the control characters for the printer;
   however, I haven't been able to create SETUP.DAT, since the only
   text editor he has is ED and I can't figure out how to enter control
   characters into a file using it.

Anyway, if anyone has any answers/solutions/clarifications concerning
the above questions, please send me mail at
	...ihnp4!wucs!wuibc!etm

  Or, you could write a procedure to print to both the console and the printer:

  type
    workstring = string[255];


   procedure both(stuff: workstring);
   begin
	writeln(stuff);
	writeln(LST,stuff);
   end;

  You may want to use the compiler directive {$V-} with this which relaxes
parameter checking and allows parameters of any string length to be passed.
{See section 16.1.1 of manual about this}.
The problem with this approach is that you may want to print both strings
and numbers, which won't be automatically formatted as with the writeln
command.

I got the following question from a friend of mine.

I can't see why you can't use the seriel card in slot one.
That should not stop CP/M from booting up.

Can anyone out there shed any light on this problem?

Reply to either him or me.

Thanks in advance..

Text: Doug,
I still have not gotten my serial card to work.  I have only an
Apple Serial Card not the Super Serial card (I borrowed a Super
card from a neighbor only to see that it didn't work in slot 1 eithter).
I wrote to ALS and got a reply they say they have a utility called
FLIP that does the same thing as DEVICE except with the Apple Slots
1, 2, and 3.  It is included in CP/M releases 3.01B2 and later.  I
got release 3.01B1 and didn't get it.  Just sent them a letter today
asking them to send it and asked them to charge their CP/M programmers
kit on my MasterCard and send that too.  I have tried alot of different
things with the printer card in slot 2 trying to direct the output to
AUX: using DEVICE .  I have been unsuccessful in getting DEVICE to do
anything.  All devices are assigned as Null.  A control-P with the printer
card in slot 2 only gives me double characters on the screen.  As I
mentioned earlier the serial card doesn't allow CP/M to boot when the
serial card is in slot 1.  ALS' documentation says slot 1 is for the
printer card and does not specifically state parallel only!  

Anyhow, I don't care if I have to put my printer serial card in slot 2
I'd just like to be able to get the output of WordStar to my printer!
my slot assignment is:
Slot #0   16K Card
Slot #1   vacant
Slot #2   Serial Card
Slot #3   Micromax-80 80 Col card
Slot #4   CP/M Card
Slot #5   Vacant
Slot #6   Disk Controller 
Slot #7   ThunderClock
If you could tell me how to direct the output to AUX: or slot 2
I'd appreciate it!

Thanks,
Jim

I am running CP/M-86, and want to be able to set the default disk from within
a program in such a way that it *REMAINS* set after exiting the program. The
bdos 14 call modifies the default only while the program is running, but I
need to chain to a program on another disk, which will run with that disk
selected. (I have considered modifying the second program to select the right
disk based on a passed parameter, but would prefer a cleaner solution.)

I don't think that you're the only person that submit has chosen to abuse. I
regularly have trouble with it, to wit: write a submit file, run it, it runs,
make one change, the whole thing bombs. Look at submit file with ddt, can't
find any bogus characters...give up...(if I had a dime for every hour I've
wasted, I could go to dinner at a *nice* restaurant)

I don't use submit anymore. I use microshell instead. It looks more like unix
anyway, and I've never had trouble with it not wanting to do what's in the
batch file. I also have another shell-type program called clip that does the
same sort of thing, and allows conditionals, more like a shell script would.
(neither are public domain, they're commercial programs)

If someone out there in net.land knows how to make submit do something
useful, please let me know. I'm very tempted to do this:

Chuck,
	Won't changing your system prompt to "A:!" screw up the way
ZEX handles input control.  If you use the "<uparrow><doublequote>" 
option in a ZEX file, ZEX turns control over to the console until it sees
a 'special character' pass by.  The special character in the distribution
version is a ">" with the MSB set.  It seems like that should leave the re-
mainder of your ZEX file pending forever.  Is that right, Rick?

Jim,
	I have the following arrangement of cards and have not had a problem.
		Slot 0:128K ram
		Slot 1:Super-Serial Card (modem)
		Slot 2:Apple Serial Card (printer)
		Slot 3:80-col card
		Slot 4:Z80 card
		Slot 5:vacant
		Slot 6:disk
		Slot 7:vacant
	Within the configuration block of CP/M, I have routines to make the
128K ram look like a disk, the Slot 2 Apple Serial Card look like a printer
with DTR flow control, and the Super-Serial Card look like another console.
The Apple Serial Card has no flow control on board, but since the printer
doesn't transmit, I switched the DTR and REC lines on the RS-232 connector.
The Apple Serial Card is nothing but a ROM, line driver, and line sensor
that I can read/write directly.  The ROM contains software for RS-232 timing,
so I use it to output a byte at a time, but I only send it a byte after
reading that the DTR line is high.  The Super-Serial Card has flow control
on board and so is called in the normal fashion of a port/status register
pair.
	If the above superficial view is helpful, then fine, otherwise,
write me at rmeier@star.arpa.

I'm looking for a program which will let me display and patch the directory

automatically check for some consistency and rebuild the allocation vectors.

I've heard a rumor that one such program is named "FILFIX", but don't know
from where it is available.  I'd very much appreciate any pointers to this
program or one similar.

Thank you,

WestWind is the result of a merger (buy-out?) of Drive C and Trantor.  Anyway,
the card said that new, warrantee-able O-1s and Executives were available for
$697 and $947, respectively.  Their phone # is 800-526-6500 outside of CA

Text: Bob,
Thanks for your reply.  Last night I had a major breakthru by getting
data to my printer.  I was able to do this by putting my serial card
in slot #2 and using PIP to send a file to AUX: (slot 2)  I have 
WordStar and would like to use the print command in WordStar, but
the next best thing would be to send the output of WordStar to disk
and then use pip to print it out.  

ALS told me in a letter that with release 3.01B2 and later they have
a utility called FLIP to reassign Apple slots 1, 2, and 3 similar to
the way DEVICE.COM works.  I have release 3.01B1 and don't have the
the FLIP utility.  ALS says they will mail it to me.  So far I have 
been unable to get DEVICE.COM to work (maybe I'm using the wrong format
for the command or something else simple).  Since ALS has come up with
the FLIP utility, perhaps that's because DEVICE doesn't work with the
Apple.  Oh, well, my main concern was to get data to the serial printer
and I overcame that last night using PIP.  It still would be nice to
be able to turn on the printer using ctrl-p, hopefully ALS FLIP will
do that by allowing me to redefine slot #2 as LST: instead of AUX: .

I still haven't discovered why CP/M won't boot with the serial card
in slot #1.  I thought it may be because the serial card occupies
some of the same ROM space as the CP/M card.  I know there is a 
problem where the MicroModem will not work in slot 2 if the Serial
Card is in slot #1.  Maybe you can shed some light on that since you
have serial cards in both slot 1 and 2.

I have ordered the ALS Programmers' Toolkit which includes two disks
containing both the source for ALS' BIOS and Digital Research 
skeletal BIOS.  With that I should be in pretty good shape to figure
things out.  

Over here in Stuttgart, Germany. I am really isolated from the
"real world".  I don't know anyone else here that has the ALS
CP/M card here.
Thanks again.
Brad

A few Osborne 1's are still available from Drive C.  Prices start  at  $797
for  52  column  screen,  $997  for  the  52/80/104 column screen.  All are
double-density, fully warrantied and include CP/M 2.2, WordStar, SuperCalc,
CBasic,  and  MBasic.  They  also  have Executives for $1197 with CP/M 3.0,
Personal Pearl, and the UCSD P-system as well as the O-1  software  (except
for CP/M 2.2, of course).

Drive C recently changed their name, I can't remember to what, but their
address is still the one below as far as I know:

I've recently become the recipient of a single board computer
(guaranteed to boot up) equipped with 8088,8087,8089, and 7220 for
console and graphics for an exceedingly reasonable price.  The computer
in question comes with CP/M-86 and not MS-DOS.  It also comes sans
documentation for the operating system. This is NOT (repeat NOT) a
pirate copy.  The computer has been discontinued by the manufacturer who
is selling off his stock.  The hardware is well documented though.

I'm looking for a book which documents the features of CP/M-86
especially the assembler.  I am experienced in CP/M-80 and could likely
use the 86 version but the book would be helpful.

Thanks,

Subject:  Need Help on BASICA Comm Support

[Preface:  I've already bounced the following problem off of info-ibmpc@
usc-isib with no luck (my thanks anyway).  Does anybody on info-micro or
info-cpm have any suggestions short of getting in touch with IBM, Microsoft,
or Andy Fluegelman (sp?)?  -- Thanks, L.A.]

I'm having problems trying to get BASICA to deal with the Async Comm Adapter
at 1200 baud, no parity, 8 data bits, and 1 stop bit.  After I do an
'open "com1:1200,n,8,1"' statement, I send my Hayes Smartmodem 1200 a couple
of "AT"'s to set it straight as to what the communications parameters are,
and then I send it the command to dial the local TELENET access point.
So far, so good -- everything the modem has echoed back to the PC has been
interpreted perfectly with regard to the comm parms.  But from the very
beginning of my TELENET dialogue, something goes amiss.  Everything I send
to TELENET is sent correctly and interpreted correctly, but I have problems
when I try to receive data from TELENET.  It seems that the BASICA comm
support software insists on setting the high bit in the 8-bit data byte I'm
receiving in order to bring the total number of data bits to an odd number.
If the data byte already has an odd number of data bits, then the high bit
is left alone as a zero-bit.  For example, if TELENET tries to send me an
upper case A (ASCII 65 -- the 64 bit and the 1-bit), then what BASICA
delivers to my program in response to an "input$(1,#1)" is an ASCII 193 --
the 128 bit is set to bring the total number of data bits up to 3, an odd
number.  I know this is starting to sound like a parity problem, but is it?...

I've done some investigation and found the following things out.  For one,
TELENET isn't the problem, and neither is my modem or the Async Adapter
card, because when I try to talk to TELENET using the 1200-N-8-1 configuration
through a non-BASIC program (e.g., PC/Intercomm or Smartcom II), everything
works fine.  I've even checked the Line Control Register on the INS8250
chip after opening COM1:1200,N,8,1, and it correctly reports a value of 3,
regardless of whether the comm port was opened by BASIC or a non-BASIC program.
Therefore, it really does appear like the problem is with the input part of
the BASIC comm routines (output at 1200,N,8,1 works fine).  What really makes
this weird is that PC-TALK III uses 1200,N,8,1 for transmitting and receiving
binary and XMODEM files, and as far as I know, I've never seen any reports of
those routines failing because of this apparent error.  That's why I'd like
to think that I'm just doing something ridiculously wrong.

If anybody's got any ideas on what the problem is and/or how to solve it,
*please* let me know.

I tried both patches in MAX.FIX, but neither really works.  Also, on
Option 2, the author grabled the instruction (one should change 1664,
not 1663).

Have you tried either one?  Does it work for you?  If not, maybe one
ought to spare people grief. I assume you want this sort of feedback.

Now available from SIMTEL20:

Filename			Type	 Bytes	 CRC

Directory MICRO:<CPM.HDUTL>
BU-V12.LBR.1			COM	 58112  5D6CH

i just uploaded version 1.2 of BU. fixed up the printer routines. added top-
of-forms, better use of spacing, etc. the library in addition to the .ASM and
.DOC has four files:

BU1.COM    -    improved generic version. should work with most micro's and
                printers.

BU2.COM    -    adjusted # of columns and lines per page. printer must be setup
                to 132 columns (16.5 char/in.) and 88 lines per page.

BU3.COM    -    same as BU2.COM but will send the DEC escape sequences to setup
                printer. no need to run a printer setup program before hand.

BU4.COM    -    same as BU3.COM with RBYANC support added. BU1,BU2, and BU3
                write a disk label to floppy with a date dependent format
                e.i. '-YYMMDDd.nnn where YYMMDD are the date entered, 'd' is
                the drive letter backed up and 'nnn' is the label prompted for.
                Using this label with RBYANC poses a problem because you cannot,
                at least i have not found a way yet, to delete an entire volume
                from the MAST.CAT. instead, BU4 will write the date out in this
                format, '+YYMMDDd.nnn' and write a second label name with the 
                following format '--BACKUP.nnn', 'nnn'= volume label prompted
                for under BU?.COM. When backing up over old floppies, the label
                will remain the same therefor RBYANC will just update the 
                volume directory in MAST.CAT instead creating a new volume.
                I use two sets of backups (doesn't everybody ???) using the
                following format: 'A01, A02, A03 ... Ann' for the first
                and 'B01, B02, B03, ... Bnn' for the second. This makes the 
                volume labels for RBYANC as follows:
                '--BACKUP.A01, --BACKUP.A02, etc.' and '--BACKUP.B01, 
                --BACKUP.A02, etc.'. makes them easy to spot in MAST.CAT.
                also, the date file name is always up front of MAST.CAT making
                it easy to tell when the last bakups where done. sorry for the 
                lengthy explanation.

The BU-V12.ASM can be easily modified to accomodate other printers. i added
some new EQU to 

1.   send printer escape sequences, detailed by 'SETPRINTER'
2.   add RBYANC support
3.   change # of columns and page size

these are all easily modifiable. i plan for some extensive DEC dependent
escape sequences to be used for Rainbow,s to pretty up the screen and printer
later, look for another upload of BU-RB.LBR

*** note ***
i did not add cut lines to printer, to messy to figure in and keep all of the
directory on one page. you may wish to redo yourself

What else is the basic program doing? To get a good communications set
both transmit and receive, the basic has to be back to the interface quick     
enough to catch the echoed characters. If not a control-s and control-q flow
control is needed, so data in and data out do not occur at the same time. If all
this fails look in writing a machine language I/O handler or compiling basic.
I had this problem with a Digital Group computer and their stupid operating
system did not set up the Uart's properly. I doubt that's the problem here 
since the other software works.

good luck,

Re filink for the Geneva - I have seen a generic implementation with
source available which should be easily adaptable to any machine
running CP/M 2.2. It is an independent effort (not from Epson) and it
is in the database on the Epson sig on Compuserve.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think I've seen a book by John Lindsay
called "CP/M-86 Assembly Language Programming".  He's also written a
similar book for CP/M-80.  Most others I've seen just rehash the instruction
set.  I haven't yet read this one since I'm still waiting for it (from Data
Processing Book Svc, no less::::: NO PLUG!! just info...)

Does anyone have any info on the structure of the data file
that comes with the Random House Thesaurus -- the additive
package for Wordstar?

I'd like to be able to access the thesaurus from some other
programs.

thanks

Subject: New ZCPR3 Files
To: info-cpm@AMSAA.ARPA

The following files are now in MICRO:<CPM.Z3NEW> on SIMTEL20.
They are also in MICRO:<CPM.ZCPR3>, and they are placed in Z3NEW for
your convenience; they will be removed from Z3NEW after at least one
week.

	LDR.MAC and LDR.COM  -- version 1.2 of LDR
	Z3INS.MAC and Z3INS.COM  -- version 1.2 of Z3INS
	Z3FULL.RPT and Z3HELP.RPT -- configuration of all ZCPR3 files
	Z3NEWS.104 -- latest newsletter from Echelon (discusses VFILER,
		ZRDOS2, Z800, others)
	WMZ3PAT.ASM -- a patch to Word Master version 1.07 to feed
		off of the ZCPR3 TCAP facility for terminal control!
		By Dennis Wright
	WSZ3PAT.ASM -- a similar patch to Word Star version 3.0!
		Also by Dennis Wright

The two patch files are really signficant!  I have tried them both, and they
seem to work very nicely!  Now, WM and WS can run with any terminal by
changing just the TCAP entry on the Z3 System.  Imagine an interactive
user dialing into a BBS, specifying his terminal, and then being able to
run WM or WS to edit files!  Very nice.  One tradeoff, tho -- the size
of WM.COM and WS.COM increases as a result of this patch.  WS.COM is
almost twice as big as the previous version; WM.COM is enlarged only slightly.

	Enjoy!

Subject: Trouble booting CP/M-86


I hope someone has a fix for this problem.  I don't have a good solution.

I have been running CP/M-86 from floppies on an IBM-PC (early model).  I 
added a hard disk and run CCP/M-86 from that, as well as still running the
CP/M-86 from floppy.  Because I had an old IBM-PC I could not boot directly
from hard disk, but had to use a special boot floppy to bring up CCP/M.

Now I have the new ROM for my PC, and I can boot MS-DOS or CCP/M directly
from the hard disk. *BUT* I can no longer boot any of my CP/M-86 floppy
disks.      

I put the diskette in drive A: and power up.  After a small wait the CRT
says '1 hard disk' and spins the floppy.  It then says:

  Interrupt #40 from C800:0353
  Strike any key to continue

vertically down the screen (and it wasn't easy to read, believe me!).
Striking any key just repeats the message.

What am I doing wrong.  I can still boot a floppy version of MS-DOS, but
not CP/M-86.  Turning off the hard drive doesn't help.  Any suggestions?

					tnx

	Osborn/McGraw-Hill has a very good book titled 'CPM Users Guide' that
covers both CPM and CPM-86 with some assembly language. I believe it is
in its 3d edition. Do not confuse this with the newly released 'CPM-86
Users Guide', I just purchased a copy and am unimpressed.

I have installed the PUBlic (1.0) patch described in Dr. Dobbs and find many
files dissapear when using a patched system!  DU informas me that the missing
files are those which follow the first erased FCB in the directory, leading
me to believe the patched "Find Next" BDOS call is quitting when it finds
a single E5H, instead of the "high water mark", a whole FCB of E5H's.

Comparison with the published listing shows my patch is identical (I think).
Has anyone else experienced this?  Does v1.1 fix this as well as the multiple
extent problem mentioned, or does v1.1 only apply to the PUBLIC utility?
Or perhaps this patch only works with contiguous directory entries? (ugh!)

Subject: ITS-binary files on SIMTEL20 - pro and con

The original purpose of the so-called ITS-binary file, with its
four-byte header, was so that people using the MIT "ITS" operating
system would be able to tell the difference between BINARY and ASCII
files (the operating system has no such built-in feature).

It appears that putting this four-byte header on all our
MICRO:<CPM.xxx> binary files is causing problems for people on other
operating systems who must strip the first four bytes.

The question is:  Should all of the rest of the net users have to work
out this extra step (sometimes requiring special programs to do it).
I think not.

The solution, it seems to me, is for someone at MIT to write a special
version of FTP that will add the special ITS-binary header on any
BINARY file that is FTPed.  This would require the FTP to be able to
query the sending end as to what the file type is: ASCII or BINARY.

I hope we can do away with ITS-binary files soon.  They're a real pain
to have to explain to every new user.

Subject: Re:  Need HELP with SUBMIT
Cc: info-cpm@amsaa.ARPA

Using submit on any disk involves a simple patch to SUBMIT - changing
one byte causes it to put the $$$.SUB file on A: instead of the current
disk, so that the CCP can find it.
   Anyway, I've been using ZCPR2 for so long, the issue is academic for
me.  ZEX works much better because it is memory based, and EX will do the
same on any CPM system.
   Thanks for the feedback.
