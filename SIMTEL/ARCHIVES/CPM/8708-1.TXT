A friend of mine gave me a nice little Z-80 system made by Access Matrix
Corp., formerly of 2159 Bering Dr. San Jose CA.  The system needs some
minor repair for which I need a schematic.  Does anyone know if this
company is still around, if so where?  Failing that, how about somebody
with schematics or a pointer to a user group.

Its a portable system with an acoustic/direct modem, Epson printer,
two 5-1/4" floppies, CRT and keyboard all built in.  Very nice, if it
only worked.  There is no model number except the logo "Access" and
a serial number (1326).  The mother board is model 695.0001.00 Rev. 9.

Thanks in advance.

Subject:  XEROX 820 DD Package revisited

Last week, I posted a query concerning a package by Software Publishers,
Inc. which converts single density disks on my Xerox 820 to double density.
Thanks to Mitch Mlinar for his response.

I've been experimenting with the problem and have come up with some interesting
results which I hope somebody can explain.

The experiment is to take a disk, format it with one of several combinations of
DD format and skew, copy to it ADV02A.LBR, extract ADV.CQM using LU, and USQ
*.?Q?.

In the first trial, I used 9 sectors/track at 1024 byte sectors.  During the
USQ, two sectors came up bad.  Repeating the experiment (including formating
and verifying the format), the SAME two sectors came up bad.  When I tried
changing the DD format to 26 sectors/track at 256 byte sectors, two DIFFERENT
sectors came up bad, but at about the same time into the USQing.  Again, this
was repeatable.  But, when I tried both 50 and 52 sectors/track at 128 bytes
(the magic number), there were NO errors.

It sounds like I have a software problem while writing a certain pattern to the
disk or while writing a certain combination of virtual 128 byte blocks.  The
problem is not with LU since I have been able to blow up sectors while
downloading through KERMIT and other *seemingly* random times.  But something
that LU does cause the problem to show up.  Does anyone know what LU does twice
to extract ADV.CQM that it otherwise doesn't do?  I'll suppy any information
about sectors numbers if necessary.  The bad sectors show up about 1/3 and 2/3
into the USQing of ADV.CQM.

My next step is to disassemble to BIOS and try to put in moustraps.  If anyone
can give me any ideas, I'd be very appreciative.

Can anybody out there help me find a company that will convert my CP/M

is only a small factor.. I just don't want to type them in by hand and
I don't have the 2 machines at the same location BUT I need to get the
ascii files off of the ALTOS Z80 system onto a DOS floppy where I can
then decide which platform to re-port the code.

I bought the SWP double density package for my 820 5 1/4" DS system, but
before I ever installed it I upgraded to an 820-II.  I still have all
the software on disks and the chip and the instructions none of which I
ever expect to use.  If anyone on the DL has a use for them, please let
me know.  In so far as I know, the package is specific for the 820.  
Perhaps someone can use it and help Elliot  solve his problem.

Twice in the last couple of days I've tried to get stuff from the PD

As this might suggest, I've been sending to ARCHIVE-REQUEST@SIMTEL20.  Is

Re:   Archive Server Shutdown

Several changes to the Archive Server have been made in the past few
weeks to improve service for replies sent through intermediate hosts.
One of the requested changes was to reduce the size of the messages by
half so that these messages don't hog the single-stream mail
channels, particularly on BITNET, for extended periods of time, and
thus give other mail a chance to get through in a timely manner.

Unfortunately, this has resulted in the SIMTEL20 mail queue to rapidly
grow way beyond all expectations: the Server was now generating twice
as many messages and our dedicated mailer for this service now had to
establish twice as many connections for the same number of replies.
That mailer could not keep up with the the queue, and for the second
time in as many weeks, we have had to shutdown the Server because we
were running out of disk space.

Because the disk space is at a premium for our regular users, and
because the resources required by both the Server and the mailer have
now reached a point well beyond the capabilities of our present system
configuration, the Server has been shut down until further notice and
for an indefinite period of time.  New requests will be returned
unanswered, and both present requests and replies will be flushed.

In the meantime, we are examining other possibilities to provide
access to our collections.  Because the great majority of requests
have come from BITNET users, we are looking for one or more BITNET
hosts willing to provide the disk space and BITSERV facilities for one
or more of our collections of public domain software.

As  soon as I read this, I knew how to correct the problem.  On my Shugarts,
there is a screw to adjust the distance between the disk and the load pad when
the disk was not loaded.  I turned out that all I needed to do was reduce the
distance, thus reducing the loading time.  Ken, you may want to check this on
your CDCs.  Note that there are two screws; one is sealed, so adjust the bottom
one.

Thanks to those who have replied.  I now have a 100% functional CP/M system
with dual 8" DD drives.  Now if only I can get PD software from the archive
server... :-)

available.  In the meantime, see PD:<CPM.FILEDOCS>CPMAUG01.LST (ascii)
or CPMAUG01.LZT (crunched) which is a complete listing of all CP/M
files on GEnie, each with a one-line description.  Since SIMTEL20 and
GEnie have many of the same files, this will be a very useful listing.
It is updated monthly.

Note: to save space in the following listing, the device name PD: which
normally appears ahead of the directory name has been omitted.

If you have a V20 chip in your PC you can continue to use your CP/M
programs on the PC (as long as they are 8080, not Z80, executables).
The program to do this is:

Filename			Type	 Bytes	 CRC

Directory PD:<MSDOS.EMULATORS>
V20-80.COM			BINARY	  7552  2D8BH

Also available is:
Z80MU310.ARC			BINARY	165376  E0F5H

which is a Z80 emulator for the PC.  It works, but is rather slow.

How  can I get the RS232 port to communicate with a parallel type
printer.  I am using Word Star, and have tried most everything  I
can think of!

Anyone have an idea other than using the IEEE port?

This is the kind of reply that irks me so much that I have to say something:

Alan, there is NOTHING wrong with your comment EXCEPT that you should admit
that you are the president of KCT which is done as a side business.  This
net is NOT for free advertising.  To soften it a little, I would not have
minded the same posting at all if you had just appended:

          President, KCT  (or whatever your title is now)

Your "neat stuff ..." comment takes on a different meaning when this is
taken into consideration: PR bs.  I don't mind "plugs" as long as it is
admitted (Jay Sage did not hide the fact he is behind the new
ZCPR stuff and wants to make money from it); honesty is the best policy.

To the net - about the Kenmore Tech Clock:

It is a very good clock, but also the most expensive one on the market at
$100 assembled.  It takes 16 continuous I/O ports and mine required calibration
using capacitors since it lost 3 minutes a week.  The board is 3x3 (or around
there in size) and stands 5/8 in high, so make sure you have room for it.
My clock is still running (on its second battery); I also have a no-slot
running (in another machine) which is easier to install and cheaper, 
although to be fair, the driver support in the KCT stuff was very good
compared to the no-slot lack of info.

     Any of the 8080 to 8088 converters will work just fine, save for the RIM
and SIM instructions of the 8085.  These, you can no doubt do by hand... if
there are 8088 equivalents ( don't ask me... I don't touch IBM! ).

     Try XLT8086.  Runs on the 8080, and creates an 8088 source file.

I recently posted a request for info about a company offering a modem for

the following bulletin, which I am passing along...

There is an ad appearing in BYTE, INFO WORLD, Compuserve's ONLINE and
perhaps other places (it may be scheduled for PC WORLD). It is a full
page ad by an outfit in Beverly Hills California called Compuscan.
Prices are absurdly low - in fact - they are below wholesale.
To make a long story short - the whole thing is a scam. We have the
postal authorities on it. INFO WORLD will have a front page story next
week on it.
In the meantime, don't fall for it. If you already have - RUN to the
bank and stop payment on the check. (Get to the bank in person and get
it from them in writing that you told them.) If you already sent money
and your check was cashed - next time remember the old -but true fact -
that if sounds too good to be true - chances are it is not true.
Please pass it on through the BBS networks.

Punt. RS-232 serial ports don't talk to parallel printers (anything using a
Centronics parallel interface, i.e. Epson, Okidata,...). You can buy a
printer buffer that has a serial input (I believe there are versions of
Quadram's Microfazer that will do the trick). Aside from that, if the Exec
(which I'm not particularly familiar with) doesn't have a parallel printer
port, you'll have to kludge around the IEEE port.

  MICROPRO ANNOUNCED UPDATE OF WORDSTAR - CP/M EDITION RELEASE 4
             CP/M Update Offers Over 100 Enhancements

 SAN RAFAEL, Calif., July 23, 1987 - MicroPro International
Corporation (MPRO/NASDAQ) today announced that an updated version
of WordStar for CP/M microcomputers will begin shipping in
mid-August.  WordStar, originally released for CP/M
microcomputers, is the most widely-used word processing software
for microcomputers.  Currently, MicroPro is celebrating its "3
millionth-product-shipped" milestone.  WordStar is widely used by
writers, businesses, corporations of all sizes and governmental
agencies around the world.

      "WordStar, CP/M Edition, Release 4, offers more than 100
enhancements over the current CP/M version, while maintaining the
look and feel of the user interface that has become a word
processing standard as well as a standard for many other types of
microcomputer applications," said MicroPro president and CEO Leon
Williams.

      "MicroPro has a very special relationship with our CP/M
customers.  WordStar was originally release for CP/M machines in
1979 long before the industry adopted MS-DOS as the standard
operating system.  We realize that we got our start with CP/M
users and we want to assure them that we will continue to provide
them with access to the latest technology.  The `New' MicroPro is
committed to providing regular product updates for all our
customers, including those who use WordStar on CP/M systems,"
said Williams.

       WordStar, CP/M Edition, Release 4 will be priced at $295
and will be available in retail stores in September.  Release 4
contains improved versions of the WORD Plus spelling checker,
developed by San Diego-based Software Heaven Inc., and MailMerge
and a new, easier to use indexing system.

 New Features

       "Early this year, we conducted a survey to determine what
features CP/M users wanted in an upgrade.  The response was
overwhelming.  Letters and phone calls poured into MicroPro.
Based on the feedback we added more than 100 new features to the
CP/M version of WordStar," said Williams.

       Among the new features CP/M users requested and will find
in WordStar, CP/M Edition, Release 4 are: "Go-to page," stored
ruler lines, new 61,000-word dictionary (dictionary size may be
smaller depending on hardware), programmable macros, an "Undo"
command, built-in four function calculator, user number path
support, onscreen bold and underline (available on most
hardware), function keys (depending on hardware), laser printing
capability, and improved speed throughout the program.  The
product has been designed to support floppy-based and hard
disk-based systems and to take maximum advantage of available
system memory resources.

 Warranty

       WordStar, CP/M Edition, Release 4 includes free 90
day-warranty support.  Ninety days from the date of purchase (or
45 days from date of first call with less than 45 days remaining
on warranty period), customers have unlimited calling to a
dedicated telephone number.

 Update Pricing

       As part of its 3 millionth-product-shipped celebration,
MicroPro will make updates available to all CP/M users for $89.00
plus tax and $5.00 for shipping and handling with a limit of one
update per user.  Additionally, MicroPro will make special
pricing available to user groups.  The price for user groups who
order 2-9 CP/M updates is $85.00 for each update plus shipping
and handling.  For 10 or more copies the price is $79.00 per
update plus shipping and handling.  To be eligible for the
discount, user groups must contact MicroPro's customer service
department and place the entire order at one time.  The order
must be pre-paid.

       For general information on update policies and procedures
or to place an order, interested parties can call MicroPro
directly at (800) 227-5609 from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. Pacific time
Monday through Friday.

     This is not an advertisement; however, based on my experience 
with the DOS version of WordStar 4.0 (most, but not all new 
features are common to both CP/M and MS/PCDOS versions), you will 
want to consider upgrading.  One of the most significant features 
is the extensive patching info provided.  With earlier versions of 
WordStar, the user community compiled and maintained complete 
listings of user modifiable patch locations.  MicroPro learned 
from this and with release 4.0, has provided this information as 
well as a program to facilitate user patching of WordStar.  The 
configurable options and patch locations far exceed those found in 
earlier WordStar releases.

Perhaps a serial to parallel converter is what you need.  One could get that
with a printer buffer as well...

MINCE (Mince Is not Complete Emacs) was written by Mark of the
Unicorn, Cambridge MA about 5 years ago, with a companion SCRIBBLE
formatter (a watered down SCRIBE).  It included source code (for bds-c
1.4x) for the "outer" editor routines and was extensible by
recompiling/relinking. It's got the basic emacs flavor:  8 buffers,
split screen, auto-insert, virtual memory, ...  It lacks the high-end
stuff: regular expressions, incremental search, bindable macros, etc.
The MINCE+SCRIBBLE+BDS-C package was called Amethyst; and there are
archived simtel20 files for the Amethyst user's group.

Perfect Writer is an imperfectly-realized modification of MINCE that
put the command-bindings into the swap file (making the bindings
configurable without recompilation), added hooks for spell and
help modes, and wrapped the editor and formatter inside an optional
shell menu.  It was marketed by Perfect Software, which was bought by
Thorne-EMI.

Perfect Writer was now and againn bundled with Kaypros, and at
Plu*Perfect Systems we developed enhancements and bug fixes that
patched the Kaypro version of PW into the co-called "Plu*Perfect
Writer" (PPW).

I use PPW and MINCE almost exclusively on CP/M machines, and use
several unix and ms-dos flavors of emacs.  For text and program
editing the cp/m versions serve me well.

How can you get MINCE or PW ?  I really don't know.  Unicorn won't
sell to end-users and long ago stopped support of MINCE.  Possibly
EMI would have a PW.  Plu*Perfect supports P*PW, doesn't sell PW;
you have to have the original PW yourself.

Right, be careful, but also don't pay too much. I got a 1200 baud
modem for $109 from an ad in COMPUTER SHOPPER. That catalog was full
of ads with stuff in that basic price range. I also just got a 1200
baud modem from the C.O.M.B. catalog for $79, $83.50 with shipping and
handling. Both work fine and have Hayes command compatibility,
auto-dial, etc., etc. I don't know how to tell the scams from the real
but my guess is that the scams are not prevalent and will be short
lived. I hope so anyway. 

Sorry if you just bought your Hayes at the local store for $475. I'm
not a dealer so don't write to me to get you one. These deals are not
unusual if you check out BYTE and COMPUTER SHOPPER (I find it in the
supermarket with the other mags).

Hi again ... I managed to dig up the specs on the IEEE -> Centronics
parallel port D connector.  Specs is as follows:

Cen               Ozzy
1                 11

The osborne connector is numbered with one being in the upper

circuit edge.

I am looking for a Small-C compiler to generate Z80 code, I would prefer

8080, but I don't know 8080 pneumonics and the assembler I have is a Z80
one.

Or...

Does anyone out there have an 8080 to Z80 conversion utility???

I don't read this group much, so could you please respond to me via email?

Subject: Re: EMACS for CP/M

Mark of the Unicorn was selling MINCE (MINCE Is Not Complete EMACS).
The last known CP/M price I saw was around $99 for it.  However, They
really wanted to push Final Word (kind of a combination MINCE/SCRIBBLE)
and they may have stopped marketing MINCE (at least I think they stopped
selling their MS-DOS copy of it).

There is a MICRO-EMACS available in the public domain, but as far as I
know, it is too big to run under CP/M-80, and is written in C.  It should
run under CP/M-86, CP/M-68K, as well as MS-DOS and the Atari and the Amiga.

Workman and Associates have an editor which is a cross between WordStar
and EMACS which is written in their FTL-MODULA-2 compiler which is fairly
cheap (around $40-50 I think).  It runs well with their FTL-MODULA-2 compiler,
and comes with sources if you feel like modifying it.

There's also WordStar, but that isn't EMACS, is it...

Any other ideas anyone?

(I work for neither Workman and Assoc., MicroPro, nor Mark of the Unicorn,
and am endorsing none of the above mentioned editors.
The other usual disclaimers also apply...)

thus give other mail a chance to get through in a timely manner.

Unfortunately, this has resulted in the SIMTEL20 mail queue to rapidly
grow way beyond all expectations:  the Server was now generating twice
as many messages and our dedicated mailer for this service now had to
establish twice as many connections for the same number of replies.  
That mailer could not keep up with the queue, and for the second
time in as many weeks, we have had to shutdown the Server because we
were running out of disk space.  

Because the disk space is at a premium for our regular users, and
because the resources required by both the Server and the mailer have
now reached a point well beyond the capabilities of our present system
configuration, the Server has been shut down until further notice and
for an indefinite period of time.  New requests will be returned 
unanswered, and both present requests and replies will be flushed.  

In the meantime, we are examining other possibilities to provide
access to our collections.  Because the great majority of requests
have come from BITNET users, we are looking for one or more BITNET
hosts willing to provide the disk space and BITSERV facilities for one
or more of our collections of public domain software.

There is no Small-C program which generates Z-80 code.  A program called
XLATE (or ZXLATE) - up to version 1.4 now - converts 8080 code to Z-80 code.
It is very nice and handles all the psuedo-ops of most assemblers.

SmallC doesn't make use of the extra Z80 instructions, so the only
thing you have to do is modify the code generator to write Z80 style
mnemonics. I did this to mine.

As far as I know, there is no VT100 emulator for the CP/M Kaypro.  I do have a
set of termcaps for the Kaypro that implement its built-in video functions, if this will help.  I also have a public domain terminal program called INTTERM.
Its interrupt driven, so it will not drop characters like the CP/M Kermit will.
Used with the my termcaps, it gives you a nifty terminal out of the old great
gray lunchbox.  (Sysline, line insert & delete, inverse half-intensity video,
etc.)  Let me know if any of this might help, and I'll see if I can post them.

SUch a thing does in fact exist, since I have a copy of it somewhere.  It
does work after a fashion; I can't really evaluate it fully because I almost
never use it.  But it is strictly a terminal emulator; no facilities for
file transfer.

There is a VT100 emulator for the Kaypro 4 (and other later-model
Kaypro's).  I have not used it, so I cannot vouch for it at all.  One
obvious problem that I have no idea about is that the Kaypro keyboard has
nothing available to correspond to the PF1-PF4 keys of the VT100.  This may
or may not affect what you need it for.  It is strictly a terminal emulator,
with no file transfer capabilities, though you may be able to use a program
like IOCAP to capture what appears on your screen (but I cannot guarantee
anything like that).  It is also supposed to have a maximum speed of 1200
bps, which also may or may not affect you.  I am pretty sure that Steve
Sanders' Tampa Bay KUG (which I think is now called something else, sorry)
would have it.

I have finally gotten MEX 1.12 to work!!  I found the overlay

downloading to a unix machine, transfering to my Apple-compatible,
going from DOS to CP/M, etc.  I have been able to download
8-bit files from my local RCP/M with no problems.

However, I have access (via ftp) to simtel20 and would like
to ship compressed files home from unix.  I have had difficulty
in using uncrunch on unix, but I could just do the uncompressing
at home.  I need to know a) how to properly ftp 8-bit files
to a VAX running Ultrix unix and b) how to use xmodem (unix)
or something to retrieve the files on my CP/M system.  Note
that I set xmodem and MEX for checksum as the xmodem manual
page (unix) said that CRC mode did not work right.  Could the
problem be that parity might be set to 7E1 on the VAX?

You should not request too many files due to keep quiet tranmissions.

WANCHO: You should transfer all pd collections to Bitnet CP/M libary.

RE:  ZTIME-1 Clock

My  impression  was  that  the  term "no slot" clocks was used primarily to
refer to clocks for the IBM PC and compatibles; the ZTIME-1 and friends are
for  Z-80  machines.  Still, if the "no slot" clocks use ROM/RAM sockets as
an installation/interface mechanism, they could be used on CP/M machines.

I have installed and used both the ZTIME-1 and the Advent clock.  These two
clocks  are, to the best of my knowledge, the most popular clocks available
for  CP/M  machines.   The  Legacy  clock also enjoys a following; I am not
familiar with it.


                               Observations

Disclaimers:  impressions  noted below are based upon events which occurred
two  years  ago;  the  products  may  have  changed  since then.  I have no
connection whatsoever with either of the companies mentioned.


Hardware

Both  the  ZTIME-1  and  the Advent use the National Semiconductor MM58167A
real time clock chip.  This is the same clock that is in the AT and most AT
clones.  It is an excellent, general purpose clock chip.

Both  clock  products  are  supplied  as a piggyback for the Z-80 CPU chip;
i.e.,  to  install the clock boards one removes the Z-80 chip, installs the
Z-80  in  a  socket  on  the clock board, and then installs the clock board
itself  into  the  Z-80  socket.   Both  boards  feature battery backup, of
course.   The 58167 is very parsimonious WRT power consumption.  There is a
pin  on  the chip which, when it goes low (e.g., when power is removed from
the  board),  puts  the  chip  into  a  "power  off" mode in which all chip
functions  save  those  required  for  register  maintenance and update are
halted.  The spec sheet claims the power consumption in this mode is in the
microwatt range.

The  ZTIME-1  board is not as fancy or "professional" looking as the Advent
board  (the  latter  has  silk  screened legends, machine generated traces,
etc.;  it  just looks like a high quality board), but it functions well.  I
installed  the  ZTIME-1  in  a Morrow MD3.  Other than a tight physical fit
(the  CPU  was near the rear of the cabinet and I had to trim one corner of
the  ZTIME-1  board  to  get  it to fit) I encountered no problems with the
board.   I  had to replace the Z-80 because it was soldered in (no socket),
but  that's  another story; see below.  The ZTIME-1 worked the first time I
tested  it.   I used it with the DateStamper (DS) software from Plu-Perfect
Systems.  As noted in an earlier message, the DS package contains a driver
for  this clock.  I did, however, have to cut a trace and jumper another to
change the I/O address base for the clock because of the I/O map within the
Morrow.  More on this below.

I  installed the Advent clock in my Kaypro 10.  It, too, went in easily and
worked the first time.  No physical space problems here.  No jumpers either
because of the manner in which the clock is addressed.  More on this below.
I  migrated  the  DateStamper  software  to  my Kaypro when I abandoned the
Morrow; the DS package contains a driver for this clock too.


Things to think about:

First,  check  your system motherboard to see if your CPU chip is socketed.
Most  are,  but  if  it  isn't  you'll  have  to install a socket to effect
installation  of  either  of these clock boards.  Not overly difficult, but
tedious.   And,  you'll  need  to  get another Z-80 chip.  (Believe me, you
don't  want  to  try to remove the one that's solder mounted in the hope of
salvaging it -- cut the pins, throw the chip away, and carefully remove the
leads  with  a  desoldering tool.  Install a socket on the motherboard; get
another  Z-80  and  install  it  on  the clock board.  Some may debate this
advice,  but in my opinion the price of a Z-80 isn't high enough to justify
attempted removal and reuse of a soldered chip.)

Next,  think about I/O port mapping, particularly if you are looking at the
ZTIME-1.   The  58167 is designed with address line input to control access
to its internal registers.  This design eliminates the need for a "control"
register  which,  on some chips, is used to select an internal register for
read/write.   For  example,  the  6845  CRT  controller  has  30+  internal
registers.   To  access these, one must first write (OUT) a numerical value
into an address register to select one of the other registers, then execute
the  IN/OUT  command  to read/write the desired register.  The 58167 design
eliminates  the  need for this extra level of indirection.  The ZTIME-1 and
the  Advent,  however,  have very different mechanisms for interfacing with
these clock chip address lines.

The  ZTIME-1 uses its glue chips to map the address lines on the clock chip
directly  into  the  Z-80  I/O  port address space.  This presents a fairly
straightforward  interface to the programmer -- one I/O port for each clock
chip  register -- but it requires *32* I/O ports.  True, that's only 12% of
the available space, but the kicker is that the ports must be *contiguous*.
The  ZTIME-1, thus, requires a port base within your system that allows for
32  contiguous  open  port  addresses.   As  shipped, the board defaults to
E0-FF.   This  conflicted  with  the Morrow port address space (even though
Kenmore's  documentation claimed the default configuration would work on an
MD3;  maybe  they  were lucky when they tested it), and I had to modify the
board  to  change  the  port  base.   The  change required solder and trace
cutting;  no  dip  switches  here.   Don't  misunderstand  --  the board is
designed to be altered in this way and the documentation is clear, but such
alteration does require trace cutting and soldering.  I changed the base to
A0.

The  Advent board is somewhat more sophisticated.  It is designed primarily
for  Kaypros,  though  it  should  work  in  any Z-80 machine which doesn't
utilize  the  port  address  space  to which the board is sensitive (80H to
90H).   (Advent  may  offer  a generic, non-Kaypro specific version of this
board;  I  don't  know.)  The  interface  on  this  board is based upon the
operation  of the I/O instructions in the Z-80.  The "standard", 8080 like,
direct  I/O  instruction of the Z-80 (IN/OUT <port address>) functions like
its  counterpart  in  the 8080; the port address is placed on the low order
address  lines  and  the  contents  of the A register is placed on the data
lines  and  the high order address lines.  The Z-80, however, is capable of
indirect  I/O  instructions which do not exist in the 8080.  These indirect
instructions  permit  IN/OUT instructions to move data from registers other
than  the  A  and  permit  register based selection of an I/O port address.
When  an  indirect  I/O  instruction  is  executed,  the contents of the *B
register*  (as opposed to the A) is placed on the high order address lines.
The Advent board utilizes this fact to map the clock chip into a single I/O
port.   The  lower  5  high  order address lines from the Z-80 (A8-A12) are
mapped  to the 5 address lines on the clock chip.  Thus, the content of the
B  register is used to select a clock register.  Somewhat more complex from
a programming standpoint, but very conserving of I/O port space.  There is,
however,  no  provision for altering the single port address (90H) which is
used  to control the clock.  By design, neither this address nor the others
to  which the board reacts (80H-90H) conflict with Kaypro architecture.  If
this  board  is  being  considered  for a Z-80 machine other than a Kaypro,
however, the port map situation would have to be investigated.


Software

Both  boards  come  with a disk of support software, including a program to
set/read  the  clock and various examples of clock interface programs.  The
Kenmore  package includes clock interface software for MS BASIC 80, generic
C  and  Turbo  Pascal.  The Advent package includes all of the above plus a
dBase II routine.

The  Advent  software  is  more sophisticated than the Kenmore, but all the
software  functioned adequately.  I have been using the dBase II routine as
part  of my dBase startup file to set the date() variable within dBase from
the  clock.   This  is  very  handy,  as  any  reader who has used dBase II
extensively will appreciate.


Miscellaneous

One  interesting  vagary  of  this  chip:  the  chip  does  not have a year
register.  So, once a year, you will have to manually update the content of
one  of  latch  registers  to  reflect the change of year.  The DateStamper
software uses the hundredths/tenths of second latch to hold the year.  This
alteration takes about 30 seconds with DDT.


Summary

Either of these clock boards will provide a useful and convenient real time
clock  capability  for  your  Z-80  CP/M  machine.   The Advent is somewhat
flashier and the support software is a bit more sophisticated; its price is
also, predictably, higher.  The Kenmore is more economical, particularly if
it is purchased in kit form (I did not buy the kit).

I  no  longer  have  the Morrow, but still use the Kaypro occasionally.  My
primary  machine is now an AT clone.  I strongly recommend the installation
of  a  real time clock in your machine if you don't have one; they are very
useful and convenient.

The  last  magazine  advertisements  I saw had both of these clock products
priced  under  $100.   Haven't  seen  a Kenmore ad lately, but Advent is in
nearly every issue of Micro Cornucopia and Profiles.

Enjoy  your  real  time clock.  Once you use a system which has one, you'll
wonder how you ever got along without it.

Please disregard Timothy Stark's mention of how to access the CP/M

small set of files I had stored there long before the demise of
the Simtel20 server.  (It was an unadvertised cache of my down-loads
from Simtel20 and those of a few others.)

The full CP/M archive as of June 17 is available from LISTSERV@RPICICGE
with (and only with) the /PDGET command as mentioned in a previous
posting.

By the way, the server apparently has a major problem handling
certain case-sensitive network addresses.  Vacation has prevented me
from attacking the problem sooner, but as my time permits I'll be
looking at it.  My apologies for any inconvenience this has caused.
If you have observed any other problems, please let me know directly.

  I have a question about the listserv archive server.  I may be the only one
  in the world with this problem, so feel free to ignore it.  I have the
  ability to send/receive mail on the internet, but not the ability to use
  FTP.  To complicate matters, because of the nature of our network setup, the
  return address that appears on the "From:" line in the header is always wrong.
  Thus, I cannot use any of the servers as is.

  My question then:  Is it possible to add an optional forwarding command that
  gives the exact address that the server is to send the files to?  To avoid
  one person randomly sending files to everyone, the reply can include in the
  header who made the original request.  Does this put any additional burden on
  the server?  Is this a reasonable request?  Is there anyone else out there
  who would use this if it existed?

If any of you ZTIME-I or other clock owners are interested, I could 
post the collection of public domain software from our Application
Users Disk.  Because many of the clocks use the MM58167, it should
be useful for others.

I will have to somehow get it all packaged together.
All of it includes source code, but is that what all you folks
want?  I don't have 'arc' for my CP/M machine, so if you folks
would like the binaries 'arced', someone would have to send me
a uuencoded arc (not 'arced' please).  Then, where should I post it?

Additionally, if you people have some software that never made it
to the A.U.G. Disk, send it to me soon and I will include it.
Please follow the instructions in the ZTIME-I manual for AUG
submissions, or mail them to me here (see signature).

Lastly, we are still here...but at a new address and phone number.

You should get one or both of the magazines that cover these (and other
Heath/Zenith) machines.   There are lots of ads for i/o devices for
H-89s.   The classified ads in these magazines also list lots of H-89s
and H-89 parts for sale. 

The two magazines are:  Remark (published by the Heath Users Group) and
Sextant.   I don't have addresses for either with me (write me if you
can't find them), but if you call Heathkit in Benton Harbor, I'm sure
they can tell you how to get Remark (at least).

what the pin-outs for the video was.   He  wanted  to  connect  a
monitor  to  his osborne I and apparently did not have the "plug"
that goes to the ext video port.

I have two osborne Is, but the plug I got with  them  (It  has  a
phono  plug  on  it)  doesn't  seem  to work, that is the monitor
doesn't seem to work when it is plugged in.  Any ideas  why?   It
works fine (the plug) when I connect it to the Osborne Exec.

Thanks for your assistance.
