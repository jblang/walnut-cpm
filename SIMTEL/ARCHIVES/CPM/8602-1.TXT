To Charles Loader:

This is regarding your reply to my request looking for a ROM PAC
for my Sorcerer.  I have been trying to call Ted Hoekman to see if
he wants to sell his or give me a copy on floppy.  However, he has
not been home when I call after regular business hours.  Could you
please get in touch with him regarding this matter?
I can be reached at AT&T on Coronet 8-377-2523 or write to:

Software Protection Symposium
To Be Held in Pittsburgh 4-5 April 1986


PITTSBURGH -- "The Future of Software Protection", a two-day symposium
scheduled for 4-5 April 1986, will bring prominent legal scholars and
others together to discuss one of the most crucial and controversial
legal issues of the day.  The symposium is jointly sponsored by the
Software Engineering Institute and the University of Pittsburgh Law
Review.  The program will focus on intellectual property law and
whether it can evolve to provide adequate protection for software.

Topics to be discussed during the one and a half days include patent
protection for algorithms, simultaneous copyright/trade secret
protection, scope of fair use in copyright cases, ownership rights in
computer generated works, and sui generis protection for software
without legislation.  Discussion on the second day will center on the
Department of Defense's software procurement policy.

The registration fee of $100 includes the University of Pittsburgh Law
Review issue in which articles by the major speakers will be published.  
For further information, please contact Carol Biesecker, [412] 268-7786.

    There are unanswered references in the users manual that the O1
    can be strapped on the RS232C port for 2400 Baud. Does anyone out there
    know precisely how to strap the standard O1 for 2400 BPS? Thanks! Dan
    
	      --------------------
		
Dan,

There is a jumper on the main logic board that must be changed to
get 2400 baud at the RS-232 port.  When you do this, you also
change the 300 baud to 600 baud, so beware if you still need to
communicate with something at 300.  Location of the jumper is in
the Tech manual, or perhaps in the blue user's manual.  If you
can't find it, let me know and I'll send the data from the tech
manual (which is not here with me) over the net.

                                ...Dick

Some time ago, i posted a bug report on UNSPOL38, which indicated that it
failed to work on my rainbow.  It appears, now, that the reason why is that
when it attempts to return system control to the user, the CP/M-80 tried
to reboot to CP/M-86.  I think that UNSPOL38 would work OK if converted to
ASM86.  Does anyone else have any experience with this?  Thanks,	der

change-able in the chars. used. it is not full on graphics but
does a nice job. You can get it from Simtel20 as

	Help!!!!

	I have an Intertec model 10 chained to a DSS-10 as station 1, and
	I need to find someplace to replace the model-10's boot-rom so that
	I can re-format my network of model 30s (unenhanced), and re-initialize
	my DSS-10.

	Does anyone out there use Intertec Compustars, or does anyone know of
	a place where I might be able to find either a boot-rom for the 
	model-10 (revision level .1, or .3) or the hub-rom of the Winchester
	DSS-10 (revision level .3 or .4)....

	My maintenance contractor is having much difficulty in locating these
	rom-chips so I thought I might have some luck asking for info from the
	net. 

	I do wish that all of the Compustar users out there will get in touch
	with me directly so that we might share battle and fish stories, etc.

	Please respond directly to me ; as I will summarize the results. If
	there are no responses, there will be nothing to summarize, so you

I have placed SF.Z80 and SF.COM into PD:<CPM.Z3NEW> and PD:<CPM.ZCPR3>.
SFILER, a Subset VFILER, is a reusable component which can be placed
easily into any Z System program.  SF demonstrates how simple the process
is and how effective/useful SFILER is.  SFILER.REL has not been released yet.

;
;  SFILER Demo - Simple VFILER by Richard Conn
;  This program demonstrates the SFILEH from the new high-order
;    components library SFILER.  Any program can have a built-in
;    VFILER-like capability as easily as it is done in this program.
;
;  Assembly instructions:
;	1) assemble SF.Z80 to produce SF.REL; command:
;		ZAS SF
;	2) link in the proper libraries to create SF.COM; command:
;		ZLINK SF,SFILER/,VLIB/,Z3LIB/,SYSLIB/

;	SF can be installed in the standard way; command:
;		Z3INS SYS.ENV SF.COM
;

;
;  At this point, the initialization required to run SFILEH is done:
;	1) HL contains the address of the start of the free space area
;		after the end of this program
;	2) the FCB at 5CH is properly initialized with file name (space

I need help setting the cursor type on the Epson Geneva (PX-8).  The config
program has an option for changing the cursor but it does not seem to stick.
With the LCD screen it would be helpful to be able to spot the cursor more
easily -- block cursor instead of the default underline.  Any ideas?

Nice  program, FATCAT.  I pulled the version 2.3 LBR file and began working
with  it.  I installed it on a Morrow system with no problems at all.  On a
Kaypro,  however,  I encountered a problem related to the exit selection on
the  main  menu.   After  pondering  it  for  awhile and playing with it, I
surmised  that  what is happening is that the <ESC> used to select the exit
is  being echoed to the screen (as are all the other menu options when they
are  selected),  and,  since  <ESC>  leads off many of the Kaypro attribute
sequences,  the  next  several characters which are sent through the CONOUT
routine  are  gobbled  by the ROM code.

So,  I  went  into the installation program and thought "OK, I'll specify a
dummy  sequence  for program exit (terminal reset) to pad the <ESC>." Sigh.
No  such  luck.   The  Turbo  install  program  won't  buy a terminal reset
sequence which begins with a printing character -- or so it seems.

Not  a  terrible  problem  by any measure, but rather annoying.  A printing
character, perhaps, for the exit selection in version 2.4?

Great program.

Help,
	I have just upgraded from a Xerox 820 to an 820-II and I seem to be 
having trouble formatting disks. Since I have 5-1/4" drives I could not use
the 8" version of CPM that came with the 820-II board and tried using the
820 version that I have been using on the old board. It has two INIT programs,
one called INIT and the other called INIT-II(I assumed for the 820-II). I am 
guessing that I need the 820-II version of CPM but I can't figure out how to port
it to my machine. Any suggestions?
Thanks,

I have an ancient copy of Magic Wand that was configured by a 
no-longer-existant dealer (in those days dealer configuration was a way of 
stopping pirates).  The print processor was configured for a Spinwriter because
Diablo printers didn't work very well compared to Spinwriters.  Now, however, 
the Spinwriter is no longer and I want to use it with printers that are Diablo 
compatible (like laser printers).  Does anyone know how to "adjust" the print 
processor for Diablo.  Investigations lead me to believe that a chunk of code 
at address 400h is replaced with a chunk of code for the Diablo.

I would appreciate any help.  Thanks.

;		     FIX FOR NULU VERSION 1.5
;		   A Message from Martin Murray
;		     with acknowledgements to
;			 Howard Goldstein
;			     01/09/86
;
; A fix has been found for NULU v1.5.  Like all good fixes, however, it
; causes its own share of problems and can only stand as a temporary fix
; until I can get version 1.6 out.  The problem was BDOS function 37,
; which NULU15 uses before writing to a drive in case it has been
; changed.  Under certain circumstances, BDOS loses its mind when this
; function is called and starts giving away previously allocated disk
; blocks.  This is no good for anyone.	The "solution" lies in NOT USING
; BDOS 37.  The problem now is that you cannot tell NULU to log in a new
; disk.  Oh well, try to live with it until I get the new one out that
; will support the fix.
;
; Assemble with your favorite assembler and merge the resulting .HEX
; file into NULU15 with MLOAD.
;
;	     MLOAD NULU151.COM=NULU15.COM,NULUFIX.HEX
;
; The result will be NULU 1.51 and will have the date of 01/09/86.
;
; More than special thanks are due to Howard Goldstein for this fix.  He
; found the problem.  He tested the fix.  He waded through all my self-
; modifying code.  His family will appreciate any help in paying the
; psychiatrist's bills.

Subject:  Archive blurb changed:

Fellow CP/Mers - Due to the relocation of the newsgroup correspondence
archives on SIMTEL20, the "archive blurb", which is a users' guide to the
SIMTEL20 archives, has been changed as shown below:

1.  The following text has been added to the section entitled "SIGNIFICANT
CHANGES":

     Newsgroup correspondence archive files moved:  Newsgroup correspondence
archives have been moved from directory PS:<MAIL.ARCHIVES> to individual
directories having names of the form PS:<ARCHIVES.KEYWORD>, where "KEYWORD"
has been chosen to indicate the associated newsgroup.  See the section
entitled "NEWSGROUP CORRESPONDENCE ARCHIVES" for additional details.


2.  The section entitled "NEWSGROUP CORRESPONDENCE ARCHIVES" has been changed
to the following:

     Copies of correspondence for several newsgroups are kept on SIMTEL20 in
directories with names of the form PS:<ARCHIVES.KEYWORD>, where "KEYWORD" has
been chosen to indicate the associated newsgroup.  At present, the following
correspondence archives are available:

		   newsgroup		   mail archive filename
		---------------		   ---------------------
		ADA-SW			   PS:<ARCHIVES.ADA-SW>
		AMETHYST-USERS		   PS:<ARCHIVES.AMETHYST>
		INFO-68K		   PS:<ARCHIVES.68K>
		INFO-APPLE		   PS:<ARCHIVES.APPLE>
		INFO-CPM		   PS:<ARCHIVES.CPM>
		INFO-FORTH		   PS:<ARCHIVES.FORTH>
		INFO-HAMS		   PS:<ARCHIVES.HAMS>
		INFO-MICRO		   PS:<ARCHIVES.MICRO>
		INFO-MODEM7		   PS:<ARCHIVES.MODEM7>
		INFO-MODEMXX		   PS:<ARCHIVES.MODEMXX>
		INFO-MODULA-2		   PS:<ARCHIVES.MODULA-2>
		NORTHSTAR-USERS		   PS:<ARCHIVES.NORTHSTAR>
		INFO-PASCAL		   PS:<ARCHIVES.PASCAL>
		UNIX-SW			   PS:<ARCHIVES.UNIX-SW>
		INFO-XENIX310		   PS:<ARCHIVES.XENIX310>

Descriptions of these and other newsgroups can be obtained via FTP with
anonymous login (as for SIMTEL20) from the Network Information Center's host
SRI-NIC.ARPA.  Ask for the file PS:<NETINFO>INTEREST-GROUPS.TXT (an ASCII
file).  And please note, this is NOT on SIMTEL20.

     File names for SIMTEL20 newsgroup correspondence archives have two
forms.  For example, PS:<ARCHIVES.CPM>CPM.ARCHIV.ymmdd  is a group of files
containing INFO-CPM correspondence going back several years.  The characters
"ymmdd" in the file names are actually digits giving the year, month and day
of the last message in each particular file.  Current correspondence is kept
in the file PS:<ARCHIVES.CPM>CPM-ARCHIV.TXT, which is constantly changing.
Although INFO-CPM has been used as an example here, the same naming scheme
is used for the other newsgroup files as well.  For a complete list of
available files, connect to SIMTEL20 via FTP and do this:

		dir ps:<archives>

You will receive a list of names of the form:

		KEYWORD.DIRECTORY.n

where "n" is one or more digits.  For example, the INFO-CPM listing currently
appears as "CPM.DIRECTORY.1"  To then get a list of files in a particular
archive, do this:

		dir ps:<archives.keyword>

where "keyword" (for example, "cpm") is chosen from the preceding list, and
the word "directory" and the number "n" are not used.  At present, all of
these files are stored in ASCII.

Hello,

     I am LT John Rossi III <ROSSI@NUSC.ARPA>.  I have been reviewing some
of the archives from SIMTEL20 and I was somehow lead to believe that AMSAA
is a clearinghouse for info on CP/M systems.  I have tried to access AMSAA by way of FTP and TELNET and have found that there is no ANONYMOUS access.  Question
#1 - Are ytou an interactive clearinghouse ?.
     Independent of direct access to AMSAA, I would like to know if you could 
point me in the direction of a place where I can obtain a version of the MODEMx
program in Northstar DS/DD (360K) format.  I am currently conducting experimentsat U.S. Navy Subbase,NLON, NSMRL and I would like to use my old standby N*
controller based kluged computer to handle some of the data.  My communications
ports are by old CompuPro Interfacer I boards so I need sufficient documentationalong with the program so that I asn patch the appropriate linklages to my user area.  I need the modem program for communication with a VAX-750 which will be
handling most of the data.  Since N* is a hard sectored format, I realize that
I have two options, type in source code, or find someone who can supply machine readable media.  I would prefer the later and would be more than happy to
pay for the service of obtaining the software and documentation I need to get
this project moving.  Any advice would be appreciated.

Thank You,

John Rossi III


P.S. I am still new to this network game so If you could, please acknowledge

Subject: Morrow MD2
Message-Id: <16Feb86.123819.PB80@A.CS.CMU.EDU>

I purchased a Morrow MD2 (used) last year for my father, and just now
purchased a Kaypro II (used) for my wife. Thanks to MFDISK and UNIFORM
I can exchange disks between the two. Given the limitations imposed
by the Kaypro II drives (191K each) I'm planning to try the Micro-Cornucopia
PRO-8 ROM with a pair of Mitsubishi disks (see article in M-C Dec. '85).
Seems very straightforward.

I'd like to do the same with the MD2; at least to get DSDD. That should just
mean a new ROM if I stick to two drives; else some decoder logic changes.
The M-C folks I talked to last week had never heard of such a thing. Of course
the MD3 does just that.

Question:

	Anyone done any sort of upgrade to a MD2?

	Anyone have a Schematic for the MD2?

	Anyone be willing to copy their MD3 ROM and determine any wiring
		diferences with the MD2 (i.e. have a MD3 schematic?)?

	Anyone have any help, at all, to offer? Pointers?

Thank you.

Message-Id: <16Feb86.124832.PB80@A.CS.CMU.EDU>

I'd like to move files between a Kaypro II and a PC-AT system. I have
only SSDD drives currently, although I am led to believe that PC-DOS
will read SSDD disks. Is this true?

I have an old UNIFORM and MFDISK; of course neither handle PC-DOS. I
understand that the current UNIFORM does. Can anyone comment on their
experiences with the product used for this purpose?

I am planning to try the Micro-Cornucopia PRO-8 upgrade with a pair of
Mitsubishi DSQD drives (see M-C Dec.84/Jan.85). How does this work with
UNIFORM? Or will it? I'd like to still be able to use these drives to
write DSDD disks for the standard 360K PC-DOS format. I'd also like to
able to use these drives to write SSDD disks to communicate with a MD2
(unless I can figure how to upgrade that to DSDD). Is this possible, or
will I have to retain a DSDD drive and SSDD drive respectively. I gather
that the DSDD drive can write SSDD just fine (sales lit. for UNIFORM).
The question is whether the 80 tpi drive (QD) can write/read (of course)
the 40 tpi disks?

Comments? Experiences? Help?

I pulled the XLISP 1.2 package down from Simtel tonight.  However, when I
tried to compile it (BTW, does anyone have the COM file?) it asked for the
file "setjmp.h" when compiling with Aztec C.  Does anyone know how to obtain
this file?  It wasn't in the LBR file.

Don't bother with XLISP 1.2 under CP/M. It is simply too big and it
doesn't make sense to try to run it since it leaves practically no space
for lists. I received a similar warning a few months ago and still went
ahead (I had to convince myself). It is so bad that after starting XLISP
1.2 all you can do is 5 or 6 conses or appends using small lists before
you get an 'out of memory' error message, so it is truly USELESS (under
CP/M that is). XLISP keeps getting bigger (and better) and any version
after 1.1 is really meant to be used on an MS-DOS system with a lot of
memory.

If you must have a PD LISP for CP/M, use XLISP 1.1, which is smaller and
will leave you some more room to play around. It is less standard than
later versions, with a C flavor, but it will manipulate lists for you.

Computer-Viruses:  Help needed !!!

Please don`t mind for posting my request into this
notefile.

I have been searching for any kind of literature
concerning the subject of `computer viruses` for
three weeks now and my results are rather poor.

I only found 2 interesting entries in the databases
locally available. Because I intend to get a Ph.D.
in protection mechanisms against computer viruses
I really have a big need for more references and
hints to get.

So, if anybody out there in the net does know something
about the stuff, please give me any kind of information.

I`m also interested in getting contacts to others
working on the same or similar subject.

If there will be enough feedback I will summarize the
replies to the net.

I am the owner of an Apple II with a Starcard (aka PCPI Applicard), and am very

I need, and how to go about installing this on an Apple, as much of the 
stuff I've looked at on various area RCPM's seems oriented toward different
(ie, more standard) machines.  Anyone out there care to give me a hand
and point me in the right direction?  I have the PCPI/Z3 library, which
contains stuff necessary for installation, but what else do I need?  Also,
I have a Sider 10 meg hard disk; does this make a difference?

Any help provided will be appreciated!  Thanks in advance.

Subject: Hitachi HD64180 - Zilog Z80 compatibility bug

Forwarded from the RCP/M Sysop Clearinghouse...

--cut here--HD64180.BUG--cut here--
 
                     Last update:  02/09/86
                           HD64180.BUG
                              V 1.0
 
 
I believe the following section was written by:
 
                             WA7GXD
 
           (See Gateway Vol 2, No 11.  Jan. 24, 1986)
 
 
     If  you  are planning on using a Hitachi HD64180 (guess  you 
have to use Hitachi if you plan on using a 64180...) please  note 
that it is not directly compatible with Z80 (tm) style peripheral 
ICs when using the Mode 2 interrupt scheme.   I know; I found out 
the hard, expensive way.
 
     I  have  designed a packet switch for Amateur  packet  radio 
usage that is based on the 64180, a PIO, a pair of SIO/2s and the 
NCR5380 SCSI chip.  It also has 16 bytewide sockets and screws on 
the  side of a 5.25" floppy disk controller.   It is on a 4-layer 
board  and we had prototype boards made (compiled is the  nearest 
software  equivalent...).   During final hardware debug  testing, 
mode 2 interrupts were switched on.
 
     The peripheral would service exactly 1 interrupt,  then lock 
its IEO line low and stay that way until power off/power on reset 
was accomplished!
 
     It  turns  out that the timing of the LIR* output  from  the 
64180  needs to be delayed (undocumented requirement of  the  Z80 
(tm)  peripherals!).  Hitachi has a simple circuit to  accomplish 
this  if  you  happen  to have the spare flip flop  and  OR  gate 
floating  around on your board.   I didn't and simply  redesigned 
the wait-state generator to accomplish the same thing.
 
     Now Mode 2 works just fine.

Book  [January, 1985 #U77]
 
                  PG 27: I/O ADDRESSING NOTES:
 
     "The  on-chip I/O register addresses are located in the  I/O 
address  space from 0000H to 00FFH (16-bit I/O  addresses)."   [A 
note  under figure 2.2.5 on page 15:  'NOTE:  A16-A18 = 0 for I/O 
cycles'.] "Thus,  to access the on-chip I/O registers (using  I/O 
instructions),"
 
 
     [Is there some other way to access these registers,  besides 
I/O instructions?  IOE* and ME* would determine whether it is I/O 
or  MEmory,  so what does the last part of the previous paragraph 
mean?]
 
"the high-order 8 bits of the 16-bit I/O address must be 0."
 
     "The  conventional I/O instructions (OUT (m),A / IN A,(m)  / 
OUTI / INI / etc.) Place the contents of a CPU register,"
 
     [The "B" register,  this is because of the way the Z-80 (tm) 
handles  the "IN g,(C)" and the "OUT (C),g"  instructions.   This 
means  that you could design a Z-80 circuit that could have  more 
than  256 I/O address,  by using the "B" register as part of  the 
I/O  address.  This  could  also means that if your  I/O  address 
decoder does not properly account for the A8 - A15 address  lines 
you may not get the I/O address you want.]
 
"on  the  high-order 8 bits of the address bus,  and thus may  be 
difficult to use for accessing on chip I/O registers."
 
     "For efficient on-chip I/O registers access, a number of new 
instructions have been added which force the high-order 8 bits of 
the 16-bit I/O address to 0.   These instructions are IN0,  OUT0, 
OTIM,  OTIMR, OTDM, OTDMR and TSTIO (See section 3.1 Instructions 
set)."
 
     [Unfortunitly   the  instructions  described  in  the   last 
paragraph  would  not  be Z-80 compatible,  if  that  is  of  any 
consideration.   A  possible  solution would be to zero  the  "B" 
register   of  the  64180  or  the  Z-80  before  doing  any  I/O 
instructions,  however  this  may  not be possible  {if  the  "B" 
register is being used} or practical in all cases.]
  

     "Note  that when writing to an internal  I/O  register,  the 
same  I/O  write  occurs  on  the  external  bus.   However,  the 
duplicate  external  I/O  write cycle will exhibit  internal  I/O 
write  cycle  timing.   For  example,  the WAIT*  input  and  the 
programmable  wait  state generator are  ignored."   [This  could 
conceivably  cause  some slow peripherals to 'go out to  lunch'.] 
"Similarly,  internal  I/O  read cycles also  cause  a  duplicate 
external  I/O  read cycle - however,  the external read  data  is 
ignored by the HD64180."
 
     "Normally,  external I/O addresses should be chosen to avoid 
overlap  with  internal  I/O  addresses to  avoid  duplicate  I/O 
accesses."
 
     Several places Hitachi states that the HD64180 can  directly 
address  64K of I/O address [which it can in hardward] (pages  2, 
5,  15,  51 and others), however it does not tell how to do it in 
software.   Is there some way besides doing tricks with "B",  DMA 
or  I/O block instructions,  that I missed,  to address more than 
256   I/O  locations?     (Such  as  "OUT  (1234H),reg"  or   "IN 
reg,(1234H)".)

Rick:

After much experimenting, I have gotten ZCPR3 up and running on
my H89, using a BIOS mod written by Jerry Furst.  One problem,
however:

1. ZCPR3 (correctly) expects to find STARTUP.COM and tries to run
it on cold boot.

2. I created STARTUP.COM using ALIAS, consisting only of the LDR
commands needed to load the system segments.

3. When ZCPR3 tries to run this ALIAS, it returns either an
"Ovfl" error, or it fills the Shell Stack.  (Didn't think ALIAS
used the Shell Stack!)

4. If I run the same ALIAS (STARTUP) from the ZCPR3 prompt, it
works fine.

I spoke with Jerry Furst, the BIOS mod author, and he reported
that he had the same problem.  He was able to work around only by
using the ZCPR2 STARTUP.COM program.

The STARTUP feature is important to making these systems turn-key
for users.  I can only figure that something is going wrong in
trying to load the system segments.

Help, please.  What's happening here?  Has this affected anyone
else?  How do I fix it?

Once I get this licked, I'll upload Jerry's auto-install ZCPR3
files for the H89 with this fix included.  He has done a nice
job, and you can install ZCPR3 from scratch on an H89 in about 75
minutes without a hitch.

Thanks in advance.

Hi folks. I have a very very old (brown case) Osborne 1 that I'd like
to get some use out of. I just recently dusted the little bugger off and
put in a new power supply (AGAIN!), and I have a few questions.

Re: double density upgrade

Which one should I use? I can go to The Valley and get myself an Osborne
made (and designed? uh oh!) upgrade. However, I have seen ads from a Texas
firm that sells a DD upgrade. Does anyone know about it?

Re: buggy rom software / bios source on disk?

In the version that I have (1.43? 1.36? can't remember now), the ROM software
was written by someone who didn't know CP/M coding conventions (CP/M is
an 8080 operating system, therefore the z80 registers are sacred and are not
to be clobbered), so I can't use things like Turbo Pascal or TLC Lisp.
Sniff sniff. Is there an upgrade that I can get that will fix the roms?
Does anyone have the BIOS source code on disk? One could patch around the
rom brokenness that way...

thanks muchly!

We ordered and installed the Nuevo Double Density upgrade (that's the firm
in Texas you're thinking about) on our brown case Osborne I in August,
1984.  It took us about three hours, the first to get our courage up to
open the case--between the two of us we have about as much
electronic/mechanical/electrical engineering experience as a sixties'
sitcom housewife--and the last because we misread the instructions, which
were perfectly clear, supplemented with photos.  If we can do it, you can.
Cost then was around $150, and we figured at the rate we were buying
disks, DD capability alone would pay for itself in six months (it did).
Besides making 184K available instead of 92K, it also stores data in 1K
(rather than 2K) blocks, so there is less wasted space.  I am not a
hardware expert, so I can't give you a detailed analysis of performance,
but since we installed it we haven't had any cause to worry about it, and
we use our O1 heavily--4 hours a day or so, for text processing and
programming.  The DD upgrade kit includes the Osborne ROM version 1.5
which uses the BIOS correctly.  There are instructions for modifying the
system tracks to use the new ROM and DD code (but be careful: it is done
using a SETUP file and it takes longer than you think to finish; if it
doesn't finish, it won't work on the new ROM, and you'll have to put the
old ROM back in and start over).  Once installed, the Nueveo-supplied
ROM is all you need to run Borland's Turbo Pascal (which we use a lot).
I can't answer for TLC Lisp because we don't have it, but if all it
requires is a 1.5 revision, you should be set.

Good Luck!

Andy,

I have a blue-case Ozzie with the Osborne double density board,
and it works just fine.  I understand that some of them have
trouble with single-density disks, but mine doesn't.

Have no first hand knowledge of Nuevo (that outfit in Texas)
products, but everyone I have heard of with their stuff raves
about the product and the service.  Probably a safe try.

Besides the Osborne DD upgrade, Nuevo Electronics has a proven one too.
Stay away from anything made by a company called Osmosis, they are
famous for their lemons. Your DD upgrade should come with a new ROM
since the old one doesn't know about DD, so that solves your other
problem. I have the Nuevo DD upgrade and BIOS in my O-1 (a blue case
model) and Turbo Pascal runs just fine on it. Make sure you tell them
you have an older model Osborne, the upgrade is different for it.

By the way, you would do well to get in touch with your local Osborne
users' group; now that Osborne has gone under that may be your only
resource for the machine. Also becoming a member of FOG (First Osborne
Group) is very worthwhile. If you can't find a local group send me a
message, I might be able to help.

Enjoy!

I have an Apple II+ with a CP/M card and am beginning to explore the world of public 
domain software. I have been using ASCII EXPRESS from DOS then transfering the files
to CP/M format. The problem is this only works for text files. My question is: are
there public domain packages that allow downloading direct from CP/M for the Apple?
Is there some way to get a copy on disk? I'll bet one or two exist in some of the
databases I know, but if I can't download them......

                             -Any help will be appreciated-

-----------------------------------------------------------------

     I  am  trying  to put together a working MEX  1.14  for  the 
following equipment and am getting nowhere.  I can get the MEX to 
install properly, etc. but then when I get to terminal mode all I 
can  get  the system to do is give me the help menu  (ESC+?)  and 
exit  to command mode (ESC-E).  I can't get the modem to  receive 
any  data at all from the keyboard.  I've tried  everything  (ie: 
switching slots,  checking cards, power off, unplug, ad naseum in 
finium);  anyone have any ideas? or better yet, a working copy of 
MEX 1.14 for the below system?

     Apple //e
     Apple SSC (dips set ON are: 24567 12345) in slot #2
     Micro-Soft Premium Softcard //e in auxiliary slot
     Disk // controller card in slot #6
     Sider 1 10M drive controller card in slot #7

     I  know  the above will work somehow,  since I have  a  MDM7 
configured and working (taken off a local RCP/M). I need MEX so I 
can use the USR Courier 2400 at 2400 baud instead of 300/1200. If 
you  can  help out feel free to call me voice at 213-539-9395  or 
530-0845 anytime after 2:00pm. Thanks in advance for your help.

re: m-100/KAYPRO hookup
There is a program called TERM that you should be able to use
if you set the console up (CON:) to be the serial port (using CONFIG)
also use CONFIG to set up the required baud-rate if different than
"normal" (whatever that is). You should then be able to "run" the
KAYPRO from the serial port. I don't know if this will allow binary
transfers but should be OK for ASCII. There is also a users group
for the M-100 users. The moderator is -drew- and the address is on
the ARPA net (as well as some others) info-laptops-request@mit-oz
the net itself is the same less -request. They have message and
program archives, and seem very knowledgable. I hope this gets
you what you need. I don't know why I couldn't get to your address
but then I'm NOT a 'net person'. 	shawn@acc.arpa

	Here's an interesting problem. I need to exchange files with
an NBI Word Processing "machine". Don't ask me why anyone would actually
buy one of these beasts instead of a CHEAPER (!) PC-AT or CP/M machine,
but here's the situation.

	They have one or two 5 1/4 inch floppies, no hard disk, are
probably 8 bit machines, and drive a multiple port letter-quality
printer. We've been told that to connect another brand machine to one
of the "extra" LQP ports will void the warrenty. Heaven forbid!

	The better solution would be able to read/write to NBI disks,
if possible. Since there are the appropriate software packages to
transfer between CP/M formats and PC-DOS formats, it would be nice to do
the same with the NBI format. And seemingly reasonable, too.

	Although our current machine is a CP/M, we have access to a
PC-AT as a potential intermediary. The question is, how to get from one
of them to the NBI? Assuming that files are ASCII (am I assuming too
much?), and that a standard floppy controller chip is used, this should
be possible.

	Unfortunately, NBI has been very unhelpful (as you can gather
from the above comment). I guess they just want to sell more of
their machines rather than to talk with the rest of the world.

	Can anyone help me with additional information, technical
data, a word of advice, solace? Also, if you know of any other forums
than info-cpm and info-ibmpc in which such a question could be addressed
would you please direct this message there? My sincere thanks.

Subject: CCS: Company going under?/info needed

  I  am  trying  to get some docs on some S-100  boards  made  by 
California Computer Systems,  of 250 Caribbean Drive,  Sunnyvale, 
CA  regarding some boards I bought to upgrade my venerable  IMSAI 
system.  When I tried to call them at (408) 734-5811,  I got a Ma 
Bell  "this  # disconnected" message.  Would anyone in  the  know 
please  contact me at the below address and tell me if they moved 
or went belly-up? Any info would be appreciated.
  I am also looking for an overlay for MEX,  MDM7xx, or any other 
programs  available using the CCS 2719 2 serial / 2 parallel  I/O 
board,  and  am  looking  for info on the CCS 2805  Terminator  / 
Wallclock board, which I am planning on using in an RCP/M. If CCS 
still exists and I can get a valid phone number / address, I will 
be ordering the manual on the thing from them if available.
  One last thing;  has anything special been done with a CCS 2810 
& 2422 board combination? We down here are especially looking for 
interesting  things done with the a custom  BIOS,  ie.  CP/M  3+, 
banking,  ZCPR or Z-DOS , and MP/M implementations. We are trying 
to do some interesting things with them,  and would appreciate it 
if  any  help or programs were sent our way.  We are planning  to 
archive  all  info  we  get,  and will  be  more  than  happy  to 
retransmit as needed.

                             Thanks,

Paul - We use a lot of NBIs here.  My first comment is that they do not
talk very well to anything!  There is a Canadian company (the name
escapes me at the moment) that manufactures a box that hooks-up to
your PC/AT.  This box has, if I remember right, one 8" drive & one
5 1/4 drive.  You put their conversion floppy into the AT and your
source/destination floppies in and the conversion box attempts to
translate from one wp disk to the other.  It will also do a wp to
ascii conversion.  The big problem is that this box & software 
supposedly costs BIG $$$ ($7k+).  For the money, though, it is 
supposed to work well.  If you want to go that route, get back
to me and I'll try to dig-up some details.

The "cheap" way to go is to connect a pc to the NBI's serial port and
"transmit" or "receive" documents from/to the NBI.  We have found
the fastest speed that really works is 4800 bps.  Generally, the 
screen shows a loss of characters, but the characters really do 
show up.  If you transfer a document from the NBI, anything that is
underscored gets transferred as just the underscores.  (It looks like
NBI handles underscoring by typing the word, backspacing and underlining.)

Our search for a file transfer protocol for the NBI was unsuccessful.

BTW, the VT100 emulator for the NBI doesn't work if you try to use it
going into a UNIX host and want to do vi.  NBI's response was
"Yes, we know of that problem; no, we're not going to fix it; and
you should realize that our VT100 emulator doesn't do anything
really sophisticated like true cursor addressing."

One more thing.  NBI makes a board for the PC that allows you to do
NBI word processing on an IBM PC.  Perhaps that will allow you to
read NBI disks on the PC.  Since I don't have one of those boards,
I can't really tell you much.  Maybe NBI can (ha!)

either public domain or reasonable in cost.

Thanks in advance!

Well, to prove my point about NOT knowing the net schemes,
I've mannaged to get the wrong address for the info-laptops
group, OR they have changed their address? (but not likely)
following are the addresses given for info-laptops by SRI-NIC
in their files:

Again, -drew- can point you to the archives for their

Sorry for the trouble. Hope this helps.

    I think your problem results from not properly initializing the
    environment descriptor during the BIOS coldboot.  In order for an
    alias to run, it must be able to locate the multiple command line
    buffer.  It gets this information from the environment descriptor.
    Your coldboot code is apparently putting the startup command into
    the multiple command line buffer, but it is not setting the address
    of the buffer into the location Z3ENV+18H.  Good luck.

Jay,

You were absolutely right.  Thanks for the pointer.  Adding the
following code at the END of the initialization routine for Z3ENV
makes it work right (8080 mnemonics):

        LXI H,Z3CL           SHLD Z3ENV+18H

I am posting this reply to the net because others have also
indicated the same problem.  Hope this helps.

Subject: Roff4 problems / What is ZCPR ?

Hello all,

As a first time user of this user group I have a few questions:

1. I am using Roff4 1.60 written by E. Bergmann.
Unfortunately I have a problem. From time to time I get the following
error message:
"STRLN3: weird character value .."
(or something like that, can't remember now)

This error occurs when I try to output various formulas like:

 x      1    1            1      1
e = 1 + -- + -- + ... + ------ + --
        2!   3!         (n-1)!   n!

The definitions needed to output such a formula are very long:
I use the following:
.sc #
e^+x^-=#1#+^(^+1^-^)--^)^-2!^+#+#^(^+1^)--^)^-3!^+   etc.

This line expands to 1 + 1/2! + 1/3! on paper (I hope).
I frequently need to build up 2 or 3-4 formulas after another (the
definitions are very long, sometimes over 2 lines of 80 characters) seperated
with some text. The formulas itself are formatted just fine; but
the curious error "STRLN3" occurs when Roff4 wants to output a footer at
the bottom of the text.
I think Roff4 can't handle such long equations of over 2 lines and is
going haywire.
The funny thing is that if I delete one equation from the (problem) page,
the error "STRLN3" doesn't occur. The deleted equation formatted in a separate
file (containing just that equation) works fine also. But the moment I
put the equation back in the original text, Roff4 refuses to work correctly.

Can anyone help me ??? What is causing this problem ? How can you rectify
it ? Are there more known problems with this version of Roff4?
Any general information about Roff is welcome also.

2. What are the ZCPR2 and ZCPR3 systems? I want to implement it on the
following system:

Acorn BBC model B with Acorn Z80 second processor
64K RAM, 56K free
2 * 400 K disk drives

The only assembler I have is the ASM assembler included in the CP/M 2.2
package. I believe you need the MAC assembler from DR to implement ZCPR??


Thanks in advance

Call Manx and order the upgrade.  The latest version supports setjmp/longjmp
as well as UNIX compatible IOCTL calls.  Well worth the $100.00

Satisfied customer only, no connection with Manx.

        I'd  like  to do the same with the MD2; at least to get DSDD.  That
        should  just  mean  a  new  ROM if I stick to two drives; else some
        decoder  logic  changes.   The  M-C folks I talked to last week had
        never heard of such a thing.  Of course the MD3 does just that.

        Question:

             Anyone done any sort of upgrade to a MD2?

We have not upgraded MD2s per se, but we have added additional drives to an
MD3  to  bring the configuration up to a total of four drives (2 DS, 2 SS).
This  required  only  that several locations in the BIOS be patched; it did
not  require  a  ROM  change.   Note,  however,  that  the MD3 ROM has a DS
personality which is designed to permit the reading/writing of SS diskettes
in  the  DS  drives.  The process is "automatic"; i.e., the ROM responds to
the  presence  of  SS  diskettes  without user intervention.  I do not know
whether  a ROM change would be required to implement what you desire, but I
suspect not.  Our MD3s are running BIOS 3.1; the MD2s 2.3.

             Anyone have a Schematic for the MD2?

             Anyone  be  willing  to  copy  their MD3 ROM and determine any
             wiring diferences with the MD2 (i.e.  have a MD3 schematic?)?

I   believe  that  the  Morrow  Owners  Review  (MOG)  offers  a  technical
information  manual  on  the Morrow CP/M machines.  MOG is at P O Box 5437,
Berkeley  CA,  94705.   MOG  publishes a user oriented magazine of the same
name which is a good source of info about the Morrows.
