	Does anyone know if there is a screen driver which handles "mouse-text"
characters (I would like to use my PCPI card on my GS with Wordstar)?

	Please reply directly to "brl-smoke" to avoid the "digest" delays.
Thanks in advance.

Sorry.  My writing error: I meant the add-on cards which use either a 1793 or
similar controller work.  I *thought* the article meant changing the *820*
CPU clock rate, not the disk controller clock.  You are correct: the 1771 no
way/no how can achieve double density.

Not really true for floppy drives running under certain controllers.

Your explanation is *technically* correct.  However, ....

Unfortunately, the *true* head settling time is actually the seek time PLUS
the head settling time on the WD (and, I believe also the Fujitsu)
controllers.  The algorithm inside the controller waits the 'x mS' AFTER
giving the step signal BEFORE it does anything else - even if it is the last
step.  Hence, there is an inherent sum where you would not expect one
otherwise.

With data from eight different Xerox systems which failed to achieve a higher
step rate than 6/10 mS on 8"DS capable of 3 mS (2 of
these where 8"SS capable of 6 mS which had to be run at 15 mS).  After
watching activity with a scope, I read the Shugart and WD manuals and
determined that relation.

Now, before I confuse somebody, Steve is really *correct*: settling time is
the sole performance parameter that needs to be altered.  What I was trying
to point out in my original article is that since the settling time is too
low using the internal 15 mS value, the added seek time delay of 3-15 mS has
a major effect.  By varying the step rate, I effectively vary the settling
time.

Clearly, the solution was simple: I decided to add an external one-shot of 30
mS.  Now, although settling time is *still* not independent of step rate, at
least settling time is always high enough regardless of the actual step rate.
All systems now work just fine at their spec step rates (and have been since
this mod was made to all of them 2+ years ago).

Subject: Altos CP/M BIOS needed

Greetings to all:
I have an ALTOS 51D (?) box which has a Z80 with much bank-switched memory, 
a single froppy dlive and a 10Mb hard disk.  It once had MP/M on it, but has
been blown away.

A:  I have (or soon will) an ALTOS CP/M floppy, 8 inch variety.
    Is it possible to hook it up so I can boot off this?
    If so, how?

B:  Does anyone have a 5.25" CP/M diskette for this so I can revive
    the box?

The purpose for doing this is so I can implement a Packet Radio BBS ported
from a Xerox 820-I.
Thanks very much.   Kurt Freiberger, WB5BBW

Subject: Determining TPA Requirements of Programs

Checking before you run a program to see if there is enough
TPA may not be enough by itself.  Consider a program that
allocates itself both stack and heap space.  Typically, the
stack space is static and resides right above the code itself.
Heap usually starts just below all the CPM stuff in high memory
and works down.  And heap is usually data driven -- you can't
know how much data there will be at program design time.
Early Pascal compilers for CPM were great fun to watch when
you could cause a heap/stack collision (i.e. run out of TPA) which
would send everything off into the weeds -- correctable only by
a cold boot.

Subject: TPA requirements

The first CP/M programs, WordStar, dBASEII, etc. were written to run
in 48k or less so that they would run under MP/M which only allowed
that much memory for the transient .COM file.  Some later offerings
(PerfectCalc comes to mind) were written without this consideration.
These seem to expect 56k or so of TPA.  Much the pity, they don't check
to see if they have enough memory, they simply run and then bomb out
In practice, there is no way to tell (unless, of course, you read the
manual) except to try it.  If you would write a CP/M program and limit
it to 48k of memory use, you can be fairly sure it will run everywhere.
Z-System (ZCPR3+, et. al.) provides means for the .COM to determine
dynamically how much memory is available and to size itself accordingly.

Subj: Stack in the BIOS, and the SB180 format
Hi

I am writing my own BIOS. So far it has been quite easy (thanks to a real
smart disk controller), and the BIOS has been structurally simple.

Now the BIOS is growing (for example interrupt-driven buffered IO, and several
switchable disk drivers) and getting more complicated; that involves several
layers of subroutines in regular BIOS routines and interrupt service routines.

So far I simply ignored the problem of having enough space on the stack when
the BIOS is called; the bios will just never need more than 4 bytes for itself
(two levels of subroutines), so I just assume that whenever the BIOS is called
(regardless whether from the BDOS or from an user program) there are at least 4
bytes left on the stack, and never ran into a problem. Now I may have to use up
to 30 or 40 bytes on the stack, and I'm getting scared. So, here is the
question: Is there any generally accepted rule about how much stackspace should
be available when the BIOS gets called ? If no, what can one usually get away
with ? What are your experiences ???

I know that I can keep a seperate BIOS-internal stack, and switch stacks
whenever the BIOS is called. That is awkward (for example, it gets confusing
when one BIOS routine calls another one, or even worse, an interrupt-service
routine calls a BIOS routine !) and time-consuming (that is particularly bad
for interrupt-service routines).

Second part of the question (quite unrelated to part one): Could a kind soul
tell me about the details of the 5 1/4" disk formats usually used by:
- Heathkit H89
- Byte/Micromint SB180
- Kaypro portable.
I want ALL THE DETAILS (SD/DD, # tracks, # sectors, sector length, SS/DS,
side bits set on which side, directory length, sector skewing).

As usual, answers directly to me, i'll write a summary.

Thanks a lot in advance !

     I have some 8" disks for X820-1.  In it, there is IMP for Xerox, and
two flavors of format programs.  I doubt that they will format DSDD.  As
far as I know, the 820-1 could only do SSSD, but there is a BIOS that will
use the nether sides of A: and B: as C: and D: respectively.  Send me a

The Xerox 820-I does not support double density, the 820-II does.  If anyone
requires dd on an 820-I , I'd recommend looking into back issues of Micro
Cornucopia Magazine. All things considered, the 820-II is the better way to go.
The -II motherboard is a direct replacement for the -I.(if you have the Xerox

Subject: Checking TPA requirements
I would like to offer another possible approach to the problem of checking if
an existing program will run on another machine, such as a Geneva. Although I
agree with others who say there is no way of knowing you can do some tests
BEFORE you go to the effort of moving the software across to the portables.
The is a nice little program around called TPA.COM. In its latest version it
will not only tell you how much TPA you have, but also simulate a reduction in
TPA for you. So, after determining the TPA available on the portables, you
could try running the software after TPA has adjusted the TPA on your own
machine. Incidently, I have not had any problems with programs on my Geneva
except those which trap the BIOS warm boot (e.g. ZCOM, QK). I suspect this is
because the Geneva has a much larger BIOS vector than CP/M offers with obvious
results!

Subject: UNARCing files under CP/M (or Z)
In the middle of last month someone posted an ARCed file which I would be
interested in getting working for one of my children. The frustrating thing
(as an LBR user) is that although I can display the ARC directory and/or
display the files on the screen, I cannot extract them into files. I currently
have UNARC.COM. Which program/programs should I have to achieve my ends?
Help/advice would be most welcome.

Subject: Godbout RAM 23 PAL equations

At the end of this article are the PAL equations for upgrading a
64K RAM 23 board to 128K.

Years ago, I bought a half populated RAM 23 board.  i.e. 64K out of 128K.
If you added more RAM chips, you had to change the PAL.  The 128K PAL would
work fine with a half populated board, but a 64K PAL wouldn't work with more
than 64K of RAM.

This was Godbout's way of screwing over customers.  It really teed me off.
They had to go OUT OF THEIR WAY to put a restricted PAL in the half populated
boards.  Keep in mind that a 64K PAL and my 128K PAL start out as the same
chip, they are just burnt different.  Their 64K PAL does cute things like
turning on several banks of chips when you try to access something over 64K.
This has the tendancy to burn up the output drivers of your RAM chips.

I had previously liked the openness and versatility of S-100 hardware, Godbout's
in particular.  I was considering recommending their stuff for use in test
rigs.  After my experience with the 64K RAM 23 board, I haven't felt 
comfortable enough to do so.

I have never forgotten about the arrogant, malicious attitude shown by their
intention bad design.

I've never seen a fully populated board from Godbout, but I knew that the
PAL had to be simple, so I figured out what I'd like the PAL to do, and wrote
the equations.  It was a fun exercise in that respect.  My PAL worked 
on the first try.  It works fine with either a half populated or a fully
populated board.

One note of caution, the original PAL allowed writes to RAM while phantom is
asserted, violating the IEEE-696 spec:

	   2.2.9.6  Phantom Slaves (PHANTOM*).  A
	line, PHANTOM*, is provided for overlaying 
	memory slaves at a common address location.
	When this line is activated phantom memory
	slaves are enabled and normal memory slaves
	are disabled.  All normal memory slaves shall
	have the capability of being disabled in response
	to PHANTOM*.  Memory slaves shall be disabled
	during PHANTOM* for both read and write cycles.
	   This line is specified as an open-collector line.

Note the explicit proscription against writes during PHANTOM*.  
Godbout's CP/M 68K relies upon using RAM boards that violate IEEE-696
by writing to RAM while PHANTOM* is asserted.  I never found any documentation
of their's that mentioned this violation of IEEE-696.  I had to figure it
out the hard way when I put in non-Godbout boards that followed IEEE-696
by disabling writes while PHANTOM* is asserted.

I have intentionally implemented the same violation, so that I can boot
CP/M 68K.  I think being able to write during PHANTOM* is a desirable
thing to have in the spec, but it is damnable of Godbout to claim adherance
to the IEEE-696 spec, when such a violation has been implemented without
even so much as a notice that they did it.  They should have put another
jumper to select whether you want to enable of disable writes during
PHANTOM*.  The PAL has spare input pins to implement such an option.

The PAL goes in socket U7.

I've had my PAL in use for quite some time now.  I didn't think to post 
the equations until a friend recently asked for them.  I hope this helps
those of you with 64K RAM 23 boards.

Subject: How do I find out what I can get to run on our Compu-Pro

We use a Compu-pro box running concurrent dos from Digital Research
It supposedly runs both CPM and MS-Dos type applications, but in fact
only runs CPM type applications since it doesn't support screen
writes for Ms-Dos.  

We would really like to get some NICE CPM software to run on 
this otherwise wonderful machine.  Can someone inform us as to where
we can get program descriptions and where we can purchase such
tantalizing sounding programs as PerfectCalc and others?

Also can someone tell us about bulletin boards where we can go
seeking public domain programs that will help us through our daily
tasks and system maintenance?

This would be much appreciated, Sincerely, Michel Gelobter.

Subject: Ode to the King

In an article published in the May issue of "PROFILES" magazine (page 15), the 
status of the Ultraboard from High Tech Research was discussed.  The article 
stated that Ultraboard would give CP/M a rebirth.

Capsule form of the article follows:

>Ultraboard is based on the Zilog Z280 chip

>Ultraboard should be able to address up to 16 megabytes of memory with our
>    systems

>High Tech Research had a cash flow problem and had to put the project on hold

>HTR states that "Ultraboard isn't dead; CP/M isn't dead.  We'll re-evaluate
     the project and if there is still a demand for it, we'll bring it out."

>SLR Systems has expressed an interest in writing an alternative operating 
     system to allow users to take advantage of multi-tasking and multi-user 
     capabilities of the Z280.

If someone on the network has the address for High Tech Research, we should 
flood them with inquiries about Ultraboard.  That way, we network members 
could have some say in the future of CP/M

How about it?

Subject: Stack in the BIOS, and the SB180 format

I will send you some turbo pascal fragments documenting
the h89 formats. If you have the actual DD h89 disk, all this
information is written out on the first sector of the disk
in a manner similar to the BPB of an MSDOS disk. You will
probably not be able to read a disk you wrote elsewhere on
an H89 unless this block is present. The default is SD SS.
The other gotcha is that the 177x controller used on a H89
is not completely compatible with the 765 clone on the SB180.
The incompatiblity is said to arise from the index hole and how
soon data can appear after the hole. According to this theory,
the 177X controllers can write sooner after the index, and the 765
attempting to read this disk cannot recover from the registering the
passage of the index hole to get the first sector.
  Depending on your bios, the index hole may not need to be observed,
so one solution that works sometimes on a PC is to cover the index
hole of the disk. I changed the format program on my H89 to write
more filler bytes before the first sector of data..
 In the other direction, I have observed no problems except that 
pc disks are formatted with no physical skew factor, so the h89
reads them more slowly than its own which have a physical slew
which is invisible after the format.

Subject: The power connector on Shugart drives

A while ago somebody asked about connectors on a Shugart 801.  I figured
out the wiring on my Shugart 800 a while back but only for the power connector.
Like this:

	1	
	2	common
	3	common
	4	-12V
	5	+5V
	6	common

There is a wire on pin one but I was under the impression that it went to
an empty pin at the power supply.  If you have -5v, pin one is probably it.

I would really like a technical manual.  Sigh...  Its a hard life :-)

The latest version of UNARC is 1.6, which is distributed as

Echelon has gone out of business.  Their software products (including TM2)
will now be available from:
		Alpha Systems Corp.
		711 Chatsworth Place
		San Jose, CA  95128
		(408) 297-5594
I called this number Wednesday afternoon, and the gentleman I spoke with
(J. Wright) seemed quite helpful and enthusiastic about the Z-System
products and TM2.  He said he would be posting an article about all this
within a few days to Usenet.  I'm waiting with "baited breath".

This is an old address taken from an ad for Handyman in the August 1986
issue of Profiles:

High Tech Research
1135 Pine Street, # 107
Redding, CA 96001

Phone: 1-800-446-3220 (in CA: 1-800-446-3223)

I do not guarantee that the address or phone # is still current, but it is a

Subject: UNARC revisited
My thanks were slightly premature! ON my return home I have discovered that
my eyesight is not failing, nor is my brain, and UNARC will not extract!
A good dose of Z8E has solved the problem, but not explained it. UNARC is
sensitive to the value of location 3E. If that is zero (it is on my machines)
then the help info and the action of the program is adjusted to stop
file extraction! UNARC will now work OK if I precede it (in an alias) by a
swift poke of this location. NOW - why is UNARC checking this location?
My CP/M documentation says 'NOt currently used, reserved'. Is this another
form of 'wheel' byte used by BYE or some such program?

A good source for all commercial CP/M application software (word processors,
spreadsheets, etc.) is an outfit called Central Computer Products.

If you are in the USA, you can call their toll free 800 number and ask for
their 64-page catalog of CP/M software.  If overseas, you need to use the
other number shown below.

They have just about everything that was ever popular for CP/M.

Central Computer Products         800/533-8049 (USA except CA)
330 Central Avenue                800/624-5628 (in CA only)

     Sorry it took me so long to get back to you with this, but I've been so 
busy lately, I just haven't had time to cook up a good example.

     I usually don't use M80/L80.  If I *do* use M80, then I use one of the 
public domain linkers, like PDLN, or ProLink.  My preferred linker is DRI's 
LINK, but I use SLR Systems SLRNK when I want speed.  All of them are in the 
ASM: directory.

     Ok, what we need here is a good example.  Take a look at the file below.  
As you can see, the only thing in it is a CSEG.  Note the *absence* of any ORG 
statement.

-----

        end

-----
Ok, we've got a test file.  Let's assemble it...

My copy of M80 has been patched to return flags for warnings ant fatal errors
in the Z-System registers.  It is otherwise *identical* to M80 v3.44.
-----

C0:SCRATCH>asm:m80 =test.z80/z

M80 v3.44 for LB/Z80 Z-System

No Fatal error(s)

-----
Well, it assembled with no errors, let's try linking it.
-----

-----
Hmmm... it looks like L80 has indeed created a zero-filled .HEX file.  However, 
if you look again, you can see that the data area goes from 1000 to 1018.  
Since I didn't specify a separate address for the data segment, the code 
segment is there.

Let's look at the .HEX file.
-----

-----
Well, what do you know?  MLOAD says that the start address is 1000h, and the 
ending address is 1017H.  Definately no zero-fill here.

As another check, let's look at the .COM file generated by MLOAD.  Note that we 
*cannot* run this file, as MLOAD warned us its ORiGin wasn't at 100h, but at 
1000h.

-----
Look at the address field of the LXI D instruction.  It's 1008h.  This
indicates that this file does indeed have an origin above 100h.
-----

     Well, I'd say that that fits your requirements.

     On another related subject, why are you using a .HEX file at all?  That 
requires much tedious calculation of offsets, etc.  Why not just assemble to a 
binary file and install?  Much simpler, and faster.

     If I can help with anything else, please don't hesitate to ask.

Subject: Good Letter Quality Printers

I am looking for a good letter quality printer that is fast and cheap.  I 
have a kaypro 4 at home which I only use for writing letters, and some larger
documents (up to 20 pages max).  I have an old Olivetti dry inkjet printer
(no longer in production - which I bought from DAK Industries) which is 
producing worse and worse copies day by day.  It does serve though for draft
copies, especially when you are used to it.  I am currently looking for
something that will provide me service for professional correspondence.  My
brother has a C. Itoh F-10 Starwriter (which he bought for $1K 4 years ago).
It is built like a tank.  He has had no service call on it in 4 years, and
it moves right along at 40 cps.  It is also no longer produced, and I don't
have $1K.  The local computer discount house has a Panasonic daisywheel
which is 18 cps and lacks the bulletproof features of the C. Itoh, but it
is still in production, and we would be able to obtain service through 
Roslin Electronics.  I would appreciate comments on daisywheel printers, as
when I write company presidents and other important people, I want good
quality print.

I have also seen ads for an NEC 24-pin printer, under $500.  Does anyone know 
if these have a very good NLQ mode.  They have a nice feature (according to
ads) of being able to slip in a single sheet or and envelope, without removing
the tractor feed paper.  Are they durable/reliable?  Any other suggestions?

Thanks in advance.

Subject: UNARC and location 3EH

Tony Addyman (MA18@SYSE.SALFORD.AC.UK) writes about the inability to extract
from archive files using a wheel-byte protected version of the UNARC program.
This is a classic example of what happens when programs are distributed in a
form other than that recommended by the author.

Apparently, Tony is using a version of UNARC which has been modified for use
on remote BBS systems (RCP/M's).  Let me assure Tony that (1) UNARC has the
capability to extract, as well list and typeout, archive files (that is the
the primary reason for the program's existence), and (2) the authorized
distribution of UNARC.COM will work on virtually any standard CP/M system
without alteration (or sensitivity to location 3E).

The latest (and only such) "authorized" distribution, version 1.6, is
contained within a file named UNARC16.ARK.  This is a "self-extracting"
archive.  If no earlier version of UNARC is available, this file can be
renamed to UNARC16.COM and then executed on the user's system.  This will
generate working program versions for both Z80 systems (UNARC.COM) and 8080
systems (UNARCA.COM), along with program documentation (UNARC.DOC) and all
associated files.

In particular, an assembly language overlay file (UNARCOVL.ASM) is provided
for purposes of local modifications to UNARC for non-universal options (such
as wheel-byte protection used on RCP/M systems).  That file contains an
explicit warning to not redistribute modified versions of the program.  This
warning was apparently ignored by whoever supplied Tony with his copy of the
UNARC program.

I just purchased the 24 printer to which you refer - the NEC P2200.  It does
as the add says, including using a "push tractor" which allows you to
park your tractor-fed paper and print cut sheets, then return to the 
tractor-fed paper fairly automatically.  All this for $339 mail order.
I find the NLQ output more than acceptable, and I think you'd be pretty
hard pressed (without a lot of squinting or a magnifying glass) to tell it
from typewritten output.  The proportional spacing is very nice too.

As for its longevity, I'm sure it won't be up to my old Okidata 92, since
the case and innerds are mostly plastic.  So far (1 month!) it hasn't had
any problems though.

I have nothing but praise for the EPSON LQ-800 24-pin printer.  I have
used them for two years now and am very satisfied.  Recently I needed
to get a printer for my office and was able to pick one up for $299 as
they are being discontinued in favor of the new LQ-850.  Priority One
and Jade (look in BYTE etc., for addresses and phone numbers) both have
them at that price.  It is a super value.

According to a distributor that I have contact with, there have been problems
with the NEC 2200:  electronically, no problems;  physically, the plastic
knobbies and the like have a tendency to break over time.

Disclaimer:  I got this info second hand, so take it with a grain of salt.
I have had no experience with the NEC 2200 except that I have evaluated the
printer's capabilities and found it to be exceptional for the price.

  I have a couple of Ithaca Intersystems 256KDR S-100 memory boards which I'd 
really like to use. 512 kb would be rather nice, and there's more where they 
came from. 

  However, there's a wee problem. Or two.

     a) They use IEEE 696 24-bit addressing. Sounds great, right? Yeah, well,
how do you do Z80-style bank switching? I can put 8-bit addresses on those
lines, no problem. But HOW DO I KEEP A COMMON BANK? The Z80's going to want to
keep some memory common, to execute in, won't it? The only thing I can think
of is to hack up the board, moving the boards address bits 16 through 23 down
one where they connect to the bus, putting them on 15 through 22, and tying
the internal bit 15 low (I think). That would make everything show up in the
low 32k only. 
  
     Surely there's a better way...? 

     b) The docs I have for them are a bit deficient: no schematics, and there
are (is?) one dip switch and one jumper which are not even mentioned. 

  The boards are identified as 1119-03.

  If anybody could belp be out, I sure would appreciate it!

Subject: A suggestion for LQ printers

Jim Moore is looking for a LQ printer.  Jim, that F-10 you like is 
selling in a number of ads  (and this must be the first time in
months that I don't have a whole STACK of ads in front of me) 
for between $250 - $299.  If you want tractors (and I recommend
them) they will probably cost you another $50.  [Stupid sheet
feeder is still selling for around $150 though, drat!]

All the companies selling these things apparently have an agreement
they signed about "brand names", it will NOT say it is C. ITOH in
the ad (although they will probably make references to the F-10).
Actually the printer was never MADE by C.ITOH, but they did the
distribution in the U.S.  Mine (which I paid $1400 for some years
ago --the 55 CPS model--) says TEC, which I believe was the actual
manufacturer.

Your right, that thing is without a doubt the best designed piece
of machinery I have come across in a long time.  Even the packing
box was a beautiful work of planning, from the built-in carrying
handle, to the little yellow ribbons used to tie the packing material
together.  I have printed dozens of boxes of paper through that thing,
and the only thing I have to do by way of maintenance is change
the ribbon.

You could do what I did. A little awkward, but the results were quite nice.
Using a wire wrap board that allows orientation of a socket with no
restrictions, place a 40 pin three level W/W socket such that it's pins
can be inserted into the CPU board Z80 socket, sandwich style. Also place
the TI MMU chip (it's a 40 pin chip, 7461x series) on the board somewhere.
Put the Z80 on another W/W socket real close to the main CPU socket, and
connect all same-numbered pins together, except the ones that need to be
interrupted to the MMU chip. A little bit of decode logic and you're in
business: A two board CPU sandwich that allows you to map any 4k block
in 24 bit space to any 4k block in 16 bit space.

In the interest of simplicity, I recommend that you do not attempt to
implement the register read features of the chip. It will conflict with the
on board buffers of the main CPU and cause you no end of grief if you try.

Also, since the data bus of the mapping chip during map register access is
also the address bus input, I found that rather than buffering and steering
the data bus it was far easier to just program the chip through the address
bus of the Z80. It is a seldom used feature of the Z80, but you can write
to a port while generating an 8 bit port address on the low byte of the 
address bus, while putting another register on the high byte of the address
bus. That register will be either the "A" or the "B" register, depending on
which output instruction you are using.

I have actually implemented this kludge on the Computime Z80 CPU board. I got
carried away and put a DMA chip and SCSI interface on the W/W board, 
since it bugged me to see all that wasted real-estate. Unfortunately, the
added capacitive loading of the extra chips and wiring made the system
unreliable at 6Mhz, and I had to throttle back to 4Mhz. Grumble. In
retrospect, board real-estate is cheap ($35) I would have been better off
just using two W/W boards.

Net-people:

	A while back I mentioned having a z80 assembler that is available
in the public domain. There has been a certain amount of interest shown in
it - people E-mailing me and asking for copies, so I am tempted to post the
executables here (in INTEL .HEX format so EVERYONE can use them). However
before I do so I want to be sure that the majority decision is with me -
i.e. I don't want to be on the receiving end of a "770K waste of time
posting" flame throw. So before I post, please email me a yes or a no
opinion, and I will act in accordance with the majority wishes. Please
note that the assembler is NOT compatible with M80 or anything else out
there, but it does have some useful (?) features (I think they're useful).
As a possible prelude, I could post the relevant parts of the documentation
that cover the inconsistancies, so people can make their decisions based
on real information.

Comments PLEASE BY E-MAIL, and I'll keep everyone posted.

Subject: Good Letter Quality Printers

The NEC printer you are talking about is the NECP2200. I have owned one
for about the last 5 months.
Pros:
1. Letter quality output. It really does look quite good, provided you
   have a reasonably fresh ribbon.
2. Many  built in typestyles. It may be as many as eight, I don't
   have the manual handy.
3. The sheet feeder is a nice touch. Works reasonably well.
4. 360 dpi resolution on graphics.
Cons:
1. Construction is not terribly rugged. I haven't broken anything,
   but I have been careful.
2. Makes a high pitched whine when printing. Annoying (but characteristic
   of low end 24 pin printers).
3. Tractor is a pain. It can be set up as unidirectional or bidirectional.
   Took me a half a hour to set up the first time. Now I have the hang of
   it, but still is a poor design.
4. Ribbons are a little hard to find. Finally found a good mail order place
   that makes their own. Better than NEC's.

I have mixed feelings about this printer. I generally pleased with it, but
think that I would be happier if I had waited and spent a little more money
on something else.
One really good deal you may want to investigate is in the last two issues
of Computer Shopper. A couple of places are selling the Epson LQ800 (with
tractor)  for around $300.00. A nicely made 24 pin printer, at a really good
price.

> Long article about assembly & linkage with odd offsets.

If I may be permitted to throw in my 2 cents worth here, I have an assembler /
linker pair that will place anything you like anywhere you like. For example
it has created code to be burnt into an EPROM (code and initialised data at
0000H, uninitialised data at 4000H), or a BIOS (everything starting at
0F200H), or if you leave it alone, it produces a regular CP/M flavour .COM
file: starting at 0100H. It's all done with flags to the linker: basically
when you link, you just tell the linker where to put everything, and voila -
there you are.

CAVEAT - It is *_NOT_* compatible with M80, so sources will need to
be massaged, but I use it all the time, and it does work.

P.S. I wrote it myself, so I have no problem at all about shipping a copy
to anyone who is interested.

approch, the CPU board had a simple MMU which provided 8 banks of 16 4K
memory address translation.  That's how MP/M and banked CP/M plus were
implimented to look like a banked system, while DMA was still 24-bit addresses.

BUT........I have an easier (better :-)) fix for you people with Cromemco or
Advanced Micro type CPUs.

I will provide you schmatics of a one chip addition to the 256K board, so that
it will read the bank switch lines from the S-100 bus.

.........BONUS........make board into 1 meg.............BONUS............

It will also show how add address decoding for using 256K mem chips, giving
you 1 meg capacity on the board.

I can't/won't character draw it here, so Email me your Postal address and I
will USMail a copy to you.

David:

While I appreciate your offer and have no objections to such a posting
myself, this kind of thing is really up to the moderator of the list
and not us.

If you aren't allowed to post it you could 1) upload it to SIMTEL20 and
ROYAL OAK, and/or 2) give it to one person on each net and let them
redistribute it, posting the contacts here, or 3) all of the above.
Either way thanks for making it available and I'd be interested in
getting a copy of it too !

David, please don't post programs to Info-Cpm.  It causes many people
to lose the entire Info-Cpm Digest because the file exceeds their
allocated disk storage.  Everyone on this newsgroup can get files from
Simtel20 either by FTP or netmail using the server at CICGE.RPI.EDU.

I can take your program as crunched files in an LBR so that all the
related files are together.  There are two ways to get it to me.
First, if you have a GEnie account you can upload it without charge to
the CP/M RoundTable and I'll transfer it to SIMTEL20.  If you can't do
that then upload it to your host and uuencode the LBR and send it to
me via netmail.  The best path from you will be

iA. Miller's book on CP/M is pretty good. You might also get source code
from the simtel20 archives. I suggest early stuff by Peteresen or
Christensen.. sources for DU or Plink or Modem before they got cluttered
up by other people. DASM is a good one to look at also. There are a
few sample BIOS floating about also. These tend to be device dependent,
so you would ideally like to find one for a machine using the same
serial and disk controller chips as the system you have. Common disk
controller chips are the Western Digital 179X series. Common serial
chips are the 8250, 8251, 2661, and z80sio. Code for these can also
be found in overlays to MODEM. Disk controller code will probably 
be harder to find.

Subject: Announcing Version 4.09 of Kermit-80 for CP/M-80
Keywords: CP/M-80 Kermit 4.09

After an incredibly long gestation period, here is hopefully an updated
version of Kermit-80 V4.05. Kermit-80 V4.08 is issued for testing purposes
only.  Version 4.09 is the release issue of version 4.08.  I still, however,
want any feedback about problems generated in this revision, or others
desperately want fixing.

Superficially, there is little real change in operation of Kermit-80, version
4.05, but there have been some major jobs tackled like trapping BDOS calls and
multiple FCB buffering...

New bits for this version include:
     SET       {SEND/RECEIVE} START-OF-PACKET character
     SET       DIRECTORY-FILE-SIZE (Shows or hides file sizes on 
                 DIRectory displays)
     SET       TERMINAL to OFF, VT52, DUMB, EXTERNAL, QUIET, REGULAR.
     SET       USER to set other user spaces
     RECEIVE   to collect a file from a remote SENDer
     GET       to collect a file from a remote SERVER
     SEND      {local filename} {remote filename}
     TAKE      to take command files from disk (including other take files!)
     FCOPY     Copy CP/M files from within Kermit (no wildcard)
     TYPE      Type a file to the console from within Kermit
     PRINT     Print a file to the printer from within Kermit
     -         Updated  TRANSMIT command that waits for a string of characters
                 from the host (default is CR).
     -         Command line commands, eg:
                    KERMIT ;SET FILE BINARY;SEND FOO.BAR
     -         Automatic TAKE KERMIT.INI on default disk on
                 loading KERMIT-80 (useful for SET BAUD etc.)
     -         Much improved speed on DIRECTORY 
     -         Automatic CLOSE-ing of a terminal connection if the line is
                 DROP-ped (currently only for an Apple, and Torch has a dummy
                 test for cntrl-] D in connect state)
     -         Improved printer handling.

On the negative side, only LASM and Microsoft M80 assemblers can be used to
assemble the source files. I personally see no point in being able to support
several assemblers if LASM can do the job, but then again, I have not used the
MAC80 cross assembler...  Comments on assembler compatabilities, please!

All source files have been renamed, and there are a few additions. All source
files are named in the form CPaxxx.ASM, where:

     a=A for general information
     a=S for system independent source files and hex file
     a=X for system dependent source files
     a=V for system-dependent hex files

The system dependent code has changed a litle too, hopefully bringing the
CPXSYS.ASM (formerly CP4SYS.ASM) file a bit more toward a manageable size.
There is now the possibility for FAMILIES of systems, like APPLE and NorthStar
(also Comart), which contains code for computers of a single type.  I have
immediately gone against all this by creating a family with the code for
Torches, Cifers, Ithacas and Superbrains (this because we have these systems
here at Loughborough.)

Bertil Schou.

[Ed. - Many thanks, Bertil!  And also to Alan Phillips and Steve Jenkins at
Lancaster University for sending this new version to us via transoceanic
magnetic tape, and to the many others in the UK who contributed to this new
release.  This version supports all the systems supported by version 4.05,
with the exception of the HP-125, and with the addition of many more, for a
total of something like 52 systems.  The new files have been installed in
KER:CP*.*, and the old ones moved (on CU20B, anyway) to KO:CP*.*.  CP/M
users, please get this new version and try it out, so we can make sure it's
safe to distribute.  And this is also the time to plead ONCE AGAIN for
volunteers to distribute CP/M Kermit on 5.25-inch diskette for different
kinds of systems, and also in "universal" 8-inch diskette format.  Please
come forward if you can do it, or know of a user group that can!]

Keith,

We've been through this before with other proposals for postings of
programs.  Yes, there are serious problems with postings and those problems
are not going to go away.  You have good reason to discourage posting, but
your reasoning is FLAWED.  It is simply NOT TRUE that "everyone on this
newsgroup" can ftp.  "This newsgroup" includes many people (like me) who are
not reading INFO-CPM (a moderated internet (?) group), but comp.os.cpm (an
unmoderated uunet group).  The constraints are VERY different.  It is still
better to have the programs posted to Royal Oak, for example, than to the
net, but SIMTEL20 is NOT accessible to everyone.  I only wish I could have
access to SIMTEL20 or ftp from other sites, but I can't.  So please refrain
from making unwarrented generalizations about what "everyone" can or cannot
do.  This is not intended as simply a flame, but you and a (large) number of
other people from all of the various ends of "the" net do need to realize
that their little corner of the net is not the whole thing.

I don't see why we don't post sources/binaries for CP/M to the net. We seem
to have sources/binaries groups for just about everything else on the net,
and some groups, such as the Minix group (at least in its early days), had
sources posted in the discussion group itself.

It's nice that SIMTEL20 is archiving this stuff, but that site is not
readily accessible for some of us, and besides, it appears they're archiving
PC stuff, and yet we have PC groups.

I'm sure there's a lot more stuff people'd share (ex: my initial cuts at
opendir()/readdir(), and "du:filename" extensions to the Eco-C runtime
library) if there were a more convenient distribution for the smaller things
at least. Some things, such as Greg Lee's EP utilities - at 1 Megabyte, are
obviously too large to post, but surely we can handle smaller packages.

Thoughts?

Subject: Faster floppy drives

Higher floppy step rates.

Many modern floppy drives work at higher step rates than the
Western Digital (or compatible) Floppy Disc Controllers (FDCs)
may be programmed for. The highest step rate (FDC at 1 MHz)
is 6 ms per step. It is a pity that the controller cannot achive
the maximum drive performance. I think I have a solution to
the problem. It works for the WD 2797 controller and 3 1/2 inch
drive in my Bondwell-2 computer. I guess it will work for other
software compatible controllers also (1771, 1773, 2793, etc).

It IS possible to step the drive faster than the data sheet for
the controller says. Just use this Z80 program:

Final notes:
    My Bondwell uses a TIME = 216 constant. The fastest stepping
    rate you normally get with the FDC is something like TIME = 900.

    FCOMM is the I/O address to the FDC command/status register.
    FTRK is the I/O address to the FDC track register.

    This program must, of course, be inserted into your BIOS.

    I hope this may be of some use to some of you. The algorithm
    may be used on 8080 computers also, of course. Maybe the
    IBM PC also can do this. I dont know that. Please try it
    out.

    There may be errors in this note.

    Write EMAIL to me if you have questions or remarks.

Subject: z80 assemblers

Have you tried the archive server?  Before you flame me please be
fully informed.  Comp.Os.Cpm is a newsgroup for messages, not
binaries.  If you insist on posting binaries I will have no choice but
to ask that the gateway between Usenet and Arpanet be SHUT OFF.

[Note: In the following discussion, if you are not on BITNET
substitute the address LISTSERV@CICGE.RPI.EDU for the address shown.]

            Help information for the PDGET command
*****************************************************************

     Selected portions of the SIMTEL20 public domain software archives
are available via a file server at RPICICGE.BITNET.  At present the
collections include the following directories:

     PD1:<CPM.*>     -- The Info-CPM archive (CP/M machines)
     PD1:<SIGM.*>    -- The SIG/M User Group archive (CP/M machines)
     PD1:<MISC.*>    -- The Miscellaneous archives
     PD1:<MSDOS.*>   -- The IBM-PC/MSDOS archives
     PD1:<PC-BLUE.*> -- The PC-Blue User Group archive (MSDOS machines)
Planned:
     PD1:<CPMUG.*>   -- The CP/M User Group archive.

Any of the files in these collections are available from the file
server LISTSERV@RPICICGE.BITNET.  The server responds to two commands.
/PDDIR requests a directory listing of files available in an archive,
and /PDGET requests a file from an archive.  The file server accepts
commands in both interactive messages or RFC822-style mail.  (On
VM and MVS Bitnet hosts, TELL LISTSERV AT RPICICGE... can be used to
send an interactive message.  Other Bitnet systems may have similar
facilities.  People on non-Bitnet systems must use the mail interface,
and must insure that the From: header represents a valid return path.)

****Note:  The server actually responds to many, many other commands,
           but none of them have anything to do with the archives.

The two commands have the following form:

      /PDGET  <format>  simtel.filename  < ( encoding >
      /PDDIR  simtel.pattern

The <...> mark things that are optional.

* "simtel.filename" specifies the name of a file to be delivered to the
    user.  Names are usually of the form "PD1:<dir.subdir>name.type"

* "simtel.pattern" specifies a search pattern used in generating a
    directory listing.  The form of the pattern is like the filename
    mentioned above, but asterisks (*) may be used freely in the
    subdir, name, and type parts as wild cards (but not in the dir field.)

* "format" specifies the method of transmission to be used:

    NETDATA  -- suitable for transfer to Bitnet hosts that can accept
                files in IBM Netdata format.
    PUNCH    -- suitable for transfer to Bitnet hosts that can accept
                files but cannot decode the Netdata format.  Files
                are sent as 80-byte card-images.
    MAIL     -- suitable for transfer to hosts that can accept only
                mail or are accessible to Bitnet only through gateways.
                Large files sent via mail are split into several
                smaller files that the recipient must reassemble.
    If the format is omitted, NETDATA is assumed for Bitnet hosts
    and MAIL for all others.

* "encoding" specifies any special encoding of the file data:

    ASIS     -- suitable for hosts that can receive binary data.  The
                file is sent exactly as it is stored on RPICICGE:
                CP/M sector images, binary mostly.  ASIS may be used
                only with format NETDATA.
    UUENCODE -- suitable for hosts that cannot receive binary data.
                The file is sent uuencoded.
    TRANSLATE -- suitable for any host, but only when the file actually
                represents readable text.  The file is translated into
                character data format.
    If the encoding is omitted, files are sent ASIS if the transmission
    format is NETDATA, and UUENCODEd otherwise.

/PDDIR Examples:
================
(1)  The user is looking for the ARC programs.
            /PDDIR  PD1:<MSDOS.*>ARC*.*

(2)  The user wants a listing of the full MSDOS collection.
            /PDDIR  PD1:<MSDOS>

/PDGET Examples:
================
In each of the following examples the user wants the -FILES.DOC file to
examine on his host and the PKX35A35.EXE file to download to his micro,
both from the MSDOS collection.  Note that none of the examples have a
closing parenthesis!

(1)  The user is on an IBM host directly connected to Bitnet:
           /PDGET  NETDATA  PD1:<MSDOS.STARTER>-FILES.DOC  (TRANSLATE
           /PDGET  NETDATA  PD1:<MSDOS.ARC-LBR>PKX35A35.EXE

(2)  The user is on a non-IBM host directly connected to Bitnet and can
     receive Netdata files:
           /PDGET  NETDATA  PD1:<MSDOS.STARTER>-FILES.DOC  (TRANSLATE
           /PDGET  NETDATA  PD1:<MSDOS.ARC-LBR>PKX35A35.EXE  (UUE

(3)  The user is on a non-IBM host directly connected to Bitnet and can
     receive punch files:
           /PDGET  PUNCH  PD1:<MSDOS.STARTER>-FILES.DOC  (TRANSLATE
           /PDGET  PUNCH  PD1:<MSDOS.ARC-LBR>PKX35A35.EXE  (UUE

(4)  The user is on some host somewhere:
           /PDGET  MAIL  PD1:<MSDOS.STARTER>-FILES.DOC  (TRANSLATE
           /PDGET  MAIL  PD1:<MSDOS.ARC-LBR>PKX35A35.EXE  (UUE

Does anyone out there know whether MDBS III (a full hierarchical database

somewhere ? Or does someone have an old one she/he wants to sell ? And if not,
would someone who has it be willing to share his copy with me ?

Any good hints would be appreciated. Also, if someone knows another good

        More up-to-date info on the server at RPICICGE.BITNET
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Date: Tue, 24 May 88 08:36:04 EDT
From: "John S. Fisher"  <FISHER@CICGE.RPI.EDU>
Subject: More up-to-date info on the server at RPICICGE.BITNET

The following is a more up-to-date collection of information about using the
server at RPICICGE.BITNET (aka CICGE.RPI.EDU).  Two notes first, though:  For
non-Bitnet users connectivity continues to be a problem.  The server uses the
From: header in mail messages to derive the return path, and it does this
without the aid of a domain name server.  Hosts not in the SRI hosts tables
are typically unreachable.  Also, there have been some performance problems
with the gateway between Arpanet and Nysernet (where CICGE.RPI.EDU is to be
found).  The ability of the server to satisfy file requests has been hampered.

           --------------
RPICICGE File Server Documentation and Usage Notes

The RPICICGE File Server gives users on Bitnet hosts nearly up-to-date
access to the collossal public domain software collection stored on
Simtel20.ARPA.  The server runs on an IBM VM/SP system and is built on
top of popular mail/file server, Revised LISTSERV.  However, since the
server handles files directly from Simtel20.ARPA, the normal VM/SP and
LISTSERV concepts do not apply.

     Simtel20.ARPA is a DEC Tops-20 system, and file naming therefore
follow Tops-20 conventions.  For this server, file names always conform ,
to the following layout:

     diskname:<directoryname.subdirectoryname>filename.extension

The diskname identifies the physical disk device where the file is
stored.  The software archives are all kept on the disk named PD.
The directoryname identifies in which archive the file is stored.
The server provides access to the following archives:

     CPM     -- Info-CPM software archives.
     MSDOS   -- Info-IBMPC software archives.
     SIGM    -- SIG/M software archives.
     PC-BLUE -- PC-Blue software archives.
     MISC    -- Miscellaneous software archives.

The subdirectorynames partitions the archive into categories, and the
categories vary from archive to archive.  The filename is generally
some descriptive name for the file; the extentionname indicates its
type.  For example,

     PD:<MSDOS.STARTER>UUDECODE.BAS

is a BASIC source program that does uudecoding.  It is located in the
STARTER (for starter-kit) subdirectory of the MSDOS archive.  When
requesting files from the server you must specify the file's fully
qualified name using the Tops-20 notation.

(Note:  The design of the server does not allow for getting files
at the top level directory, e.g. PD:<CPM>CPM.CRCLST is not available.
However, since the files at the top level are generally directory
listings, the need for them is superceded by the /PDDIR command.)

Requests are sent to LISTSERV@RPICICGE.BITNET either as RFC822-style
mail, or as interactive messages.  Two commands are supported by the
server.  The /PDDIR command requests a directory of available files,
and the /PDDIR command requests a specific file.

*********************
The /PDDIR command. *
*********************
The /PDDIR command is used to list the names of files that match some
pattern.  The command has several forms.  They are:

    /PDDIR
    /PDDIR  PD:<directory>
    /PDDIR  PD:<directory.subdirectory>filename.ext  age

The first form lists the names of all the archives known to the server.
At present these are CPM, SIGM, PC-BLUE, MSDOS, and MISC.  The second
form lists the names of all the subdirectories in a particular archive.
(The directory name must be one of the known archives: CPM, SIGM, etc.)
The third form lists the names of files in the archive.  The age
parameter limits how old a file in the archive may be and still be
considered.  If omitted, the default is 30, meaning 30 days old.
The directory name must be one of CPM, SIGM, PC-BLUE, MSDOS, or MISC.
The subdirectory, filename, and ext may include asterisks ('*') as
"wild-card" characters.  The following are examples.

    /PDDIR PD:<MSDOS>  --Lists all subdirectories in the MSDOS archive.
    /PDDIR PD:<SIGM.*>*.*   --Lists files added in the last 30 days.
    /PDDIR PD:<MISC.VAXVMS>*.* 9999 --Lists VAX/VMS related files.
    /PDDIR PD:<CPM>UUDECODE*.* 9999 --Lists uudecode software for CP/M.

*********************
The /PDDIR command. *
*********************
The /PDGET command is used to request specific files.  No pattern-
matching is allowed.  The syntax for this command is as follows:

    /PDGET  format  simtel.filename   ( encoding

The format specifies how the file is to be transmitted.  Allowed
values are NETDATA, PUNCH, and MAIL.

    NETDATA  -- suitable for transfer to Bitnet hosts that can accept
                files in IBM Netdata format.
    PUNCH    -- suitable for transfer to Bitnet hosts that can accept
                files but cannot decode the Netdata format.  Files
                are sent as 80-byte card-images.
    MAIL     -- suitable for transfer to hosts that can accept only
                mail or are accessible to Bitnet only through gateways.
                Large files sent via mail are split into several
                smaller files that the recipient must reassemble.

If the format is omitted, NETDATA is assumed for Bitnet hosts and MAIL
for all others.

The encoding specifies any special translation for the file data:

    ASIS     -- suitable for hosts that can receive binary data.  The
                file is sent exactly as it is stored on the server:
                binary images of the file data.  ASIS may be used
                only with format NETDATA.
    UUENCODE -- suitable for hosts that cannot receive binary data.
                The file is sent uuencoded.
    TRANSLATE -- suitable for any host, but only when the file actually
                represents readable text.  The file is translated to
                EBCDIC.  (If you are on an ASCII machine, then your
                system should automatically translate to ASCII when
                the file arrives.) TRANSLATE applied to a binary file
                will yield trash.

If no encoding is specified, then ASIS is assumed for NETDATA, and
UUENCODE for the others.

*** Note:  Users on non-IBM hosts should remember that with the
           NETDATA/ASIS server defaults, binary data is put on an
           EBCDIC network (viz. Bitnet).  The normal action of most
           non-IBM networking software is to do EBCDIC/ASCII trans-
           lation on incoming data.  This will render most files
           from the server useless.  Non-IBM users should either
           use one of the other encoding options or receive the
           a file without translation.  (Jnet has this capability.)

In each of the following examples the user wants the UUDECODE.HEX and
the UNARC16.ARK file to download to a CP/M micro.

(1)  The user is on an IBM host directly connected to Bitnet:
          /PDGET  NETDATA  PD:<CPM.STARTER-KIT>UUDECODE.HEX (TRANSLATE
          /PDGET  NETDATA  PD:<CPM.ARC-LBR>UNARC16.ARK

(2)  The user is on a non-IBM host directly connected to Bitnet and can
     receive Netdata files, but not binary:
          /PDGET  NETDATA  PD:<CPM.STARTER-KIT>UUDECODE.HEX (TRANSLATE
          /PDGET  NETDATA  PD:<CPM.ARC-LBR>UNARC16.ARK  (UUE

(3)  The user is on some host somewhere:
          /PDGET  MAIL  PD:<CPM.STARTER-KIT>UUDECODE.HEX (TRANSLATE
          /PDGET  MAIL  PD:<CPM.ARC-LBR>UNARC16.ARK  (UUE

*********************
Additional remarks: *
*********************
(1)  If the server is unable to satisfy a request for a file from
     Simtel20 in three days, the request is rejected.

(2)  The server limits /PDGET and /PDDIR request by number and by size.
     The limits are adjusted periodically to regulate network load.

(3)  The server refreshes its directory listings of files at Simtel20
     about every two days.  Therefore, there is a window during which
     requests for recently deleted files are accepted by the server
     and requests for recently added files are rejected.

(4)  The server is EXPERIMENTAL.  It is supported on an as-time-is-
     available, best-efforts basis.

(5)  The primary mission of the server is to support the Info-CPM
     community on Bitnet.  General availability will continue as
     long as that mission is not compromised, and as long as disk
     space, system load, and network load are not a problem.

(6)  Problems regarding the service should be sent directly to
     FISHER@RPICICGE, and not to anyone at Simtel20 or its associated
     interest groups.

Subject: Good Letter Quality Printers

You should also look at the Star NB24-10, when comparing 24-pin printers.
We just bought one for home use, and we like it so far. I think you can get
one mail-order ~$400. Here is a short list of features.

	- emulates epson, IBM Proprinter and IBM graphics printer.
	- ~180Cps draft, ~70Cps NLQ (This is from memory)
	- countless pitch/print style combinations programmable
	  from the front panel
	- has 3 different characters tables (2 have special characters
	  like foreign characters and IBM style graphics characters)
	- tractor and friction feed (no form parking though)
	- print quality looks a little better than the NEC P2200
	- it's seems pretty rugged for a low-cost printers. 
	- one build in font, downloadable fonts and optional font
	  cartridge.
	- they also make it with a 15" carriage (NB24-15) it also
	  has (2) font ports.

We bought it mainly to replace a NEC 360 ELF and are very satisfied
with print quality and versatility.  I wish they would have had this
printer back when we bought the ELF. Anyone want to buy a used NEC ELF ?

Subject: MexPack VT100 Emulator

 
Gordon Marwood asked about VT100 emulators.  The MexPack (and MexPlus) VT100
emulator package is still available for purchase.  My wife's company, Sage
Microsystems East, sells it, as does I am sure NightOwl software (the author
Ron Fowler's company).  MexPack includes a few emulators and other items and
costs either $30 or $40, I believe, as an option with Mex-Plus (which is $50
or $60, I believe -- the combination is no more than $100).  Sorry that I
don't remember the exact price.  Obviously, I can get it.
 
The VT100 emulation is limited to what can reasonably be done on a screen. 
Thus it does not include 132-character width or double-height formats.  It
may support scroll windows, but I am not sure of that.  It does require that
the host system have certain facilities, including insert and delete line
capability.
 
Let me know if you have further questions or interest.

Subject: Posting cp/m sources and binaries

Background:  I am a person on the Usenet side of things, and I have
             contributed a goodly number of programs (all high quality
	     of course :-) ) to simtel20 by emailing them to Keith P.

	     In fact, I've just got working a CP/M-80 version of
	     "uncompress" that decompresses files compressed with
	     the Unix "COMPRESS" program (with 16-bit compress!).
	     I'm currently working on assembly-language speedups for it.

	     I've got a couple other programs that I already finished
	     but haven't gotten around to distributing them yet.

PROBLEM:
=======
	  a) People want to post and receive CP/M program source and binaries.
	  b) This if fine for those on the "Usenet" side of this newsgroup.
	  c) This is "forbidden" on the ARPA side of the newsnet gateway.
	  d) Nothing is posted to usenet side to keep the ARPA side happy.
	  e) The ARPA side has ftp access to SIMTEL20, the USENET side does
	     not.  Files of things I would normally post to this net
	     (like other computer groups) get mailed "to" the Simtel20
	     archive.  In other words:  the usenet side of this newsnet
	     gives up program/source availablity  in order to keep the
	     ARPA gateway.  Why this is a good deal for the USENETers is
	     not clear.

SOLUTIONS:
=========
	 a)  Mail-server on Simtel20 that gives usenet folk access to
	     simtel20 archives.  

	     This was tried but turned off due to excess burden of the
	     simtel20 machine.

	     Maybe it could be viable if the server could access ONLY
	     CP/M archives.  When it was last up, you could access
	     ALL archives, and other news groups "heard about it" and
	     were using it for everything.  Even the IBM pc group that
	     has it's own binary and source groups!

	 b)  A new USENET group for binaries and sources:

	 		comp.os.cpm.sources

		(and allow both binaries and sources).

	     This new group would NOT be gatewayed the the ARPA world.


	 c)  Have the gatewaying program (?) look for a keyword in the
	     subject line (like: _PROGRAM_) and NOT pass any that
	     have that keyword in it.

	     Then, require that keyword to be included in all program
	     postings.


	 d)  Drop the connection between the USENET side and the
	     ARPA side.  This probably would be a net-gain for the
	     Usenet side even if not optimum.

That's part of the story.  The other part was that the server was
overburdening the network resources and the intermediate hosts
relaying the mail files.  Toward the end, the output volume probably
exceeded the combined total of all the other hosts on the net.

	 b)  A new USENET group for binaries and sources:

This is probably the best overall solution, provided that Keith is

FTP access to SIMTEL20.ARPA will be shut down tonight for several
hours while we reorganize some directories to equalize the usage of
devices PD1: and PD2:  We were running out of space on PD1:

CPM, CPMUG, SIGM, and ZSYS will be moved from PD1: to PD2:, and 
MACINTOSH will be moved from PD2: to PD1:.

Please make a note of these changes so you can change any batch files

Will it support the VT100 application keypad?
(that's where the keypad keys have their codes changed by request of the
host computer, so it can distinguish them from the number keys on 
the top row).

I'm looking for a good VT100 emulator for a Kaypro 2.
It has to have application keypad support.
It doesn't need file transfer, just good emulation.

Any suggestions?

Net-people:

	In respect of Keith's wishes I am not posting ZSM to the net. I
AM going to get a copy to Keith at simtel20.arpa, for the benefit of all
internet & bitnet people, and for those UUCP sites that have written or
posted, I have all requests saved, and will ship them out. Sadly, I've
limited myself to one a night to keep the load on our neighbours to a
minimum, so it may be a week or two before I get back to you. Please be
patient, you'll get it eventually.

	As an aside, does anyone have the mailing address of someone who
looks after the SIG/M or CPMUG libraries, cause since I'm doing this, I
might as well go the whole hog and put it in the P.D. libraries. (P.S.
whatever became of ZOSO :-) :-)

There is also a Kaypro VT100 emulator (VT100KAY.LBR) in SIMTEL20 archives

Is this true?  If so, why?  It would seem this would be the ideal
place to post a CP/M binary, since it wouldn't run on any other
machine, and therefore would be uninteresting in any other group.
Maybe you are saying binaries should not be posted at all, but
disseminated via BBS's and the like?

Subject: How can I do direct disk access with SoftCard CP/M?

Actually, it's my daughter who needs it.  She's using an Apple ][+ with
an oldstyle Microsoft SoftCard, and two Disk ][ floppy drives.  She's
been getting a unusual number of format errors that show up as bad
sectors some time after the disk is formatted -- usually in the middle
of a WordStar save, which is catastrophic if the file is new and large.

So the question is, since Microsoft wasn't kind enough to supply me with
its driver sources way back in '82, I don't know how to write a program
that can verify the format by reading each sector directly.  BIOS calls
appear able to read only real files via the FCB, which means that I can
only read tracks 4-34, and that only if I turn that area into a 126K
file by writing it first.  There's gotta be a better way!

What makes this more difficult is that I'm not really a CP/M wizard --
I don't know how to go poking around looking for things in a running
system, and wouldn't know what to look for if I did.

Any offers of help, suggestions, what have you?  Maybe an existing
program that does what I need?  If that's the case, I'll happily pay
for the mailing of a disk with said program on it -- sources included
if possible, please, so I might not have to ask a question like this
again.

Well, see if the people at SoftKlone - the makers of Mirror (a crosstalk(R)
clone) - have Mirror for CP/M (R).  I doubt it, but it is worth a check,
as their MS/DOS (R) Mirror (R) has both Vt100 and Vt52 emulation.  I have
not checked to see about keypad support.  Go to your local software
store and ask them to look up SoftKlone or Mirror (R) and give you
the address/phone number.

Or email me and I will find where I hid the documentation for Mirror

I believe Mex's overlay supports function keys and probably will support the
function keys in application mode if you can redefine them on the Kaypro
before running Mex.  I redefined them on my Zorba using the Zorba's bios
redefinition functions and setup program and they worked fine with EDT.  Of 
course the keys did not have their definitions swapped by the escape code to put
them in application mode, but since they were there already it worked fine.

Yes, it was released on February 1, 1988 as:

Filename			Type	 Bytes	 CRC

Directory PD2:<CPM.GENDOC>
UCPM10.ARK			BINARY	 74064  C16FH

It's a very extensive list, arranged so it can be easily printed.
I thought the file was announced to Info-Cpm.  If not, I'm sorry.
It's well worth reading.

For those unable to access SIMTEL20 because of network restrictions,
please remember that MOST of the new files announced to Info-Cpm are
also available on my RCP/M Royal Oak (MI) which may be accessed at
300 bps (Bell 103a), 1200 bps (Bell 212a), 2400 bps (V.22 bis), or
9600 bps (HST).  The telephone number is (313) 759-6569.  They are
also available from the CP/M RoundTable on General Electric
Information Services' GEnie.

The directories on my RCP/M have been recently reorganized.  The MAP
command will produce the following display:
