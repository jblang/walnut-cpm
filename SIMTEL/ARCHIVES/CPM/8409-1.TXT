David,

I used to be included on your distribution list for INFO-CPM until we were
moved to another host which can't support a large amount of message traffic.
(This may soon be changed, I hope.)  I enjoyed very much the information I
received from it.

A member of our users group needs some information and I know of no better
source than INFO-CPM participants.

Would you please ask them if they know of a utility (public domain or 
copywrited) that can read files on a MS-DOS dik and transfer them to a CP/M-
80 or CP/M-86 disk?

Since I don't have access to INFO-CPM would yu have them send answers to
EDENS@ALMSA-1?

Thank you for your help.

Crede

EDENS@ALMSA-1

Only book I've found that explains much is Inside CP/M by David E Cortesi
(Holt, Rinehart and Winston).  It's primarily about CP/M-80, but the
file structure for CP/M-86 is the same.

You also should get hold of one of the public domain programs for
looking at the disk by sector.  Best known is DU in both CP/M-80 and
CP/M-86 versions.  Just about any RCPM (CP/M bulletin board) will have
the CP/M-80 version.  Larger ones will have the CP/M-86 version also.

Good luck.  CP/M's pretty simple, but the poor documentation makes it
pretty hard to figure out what's going on.

For CP/M 80 (2.2), you cannot beat Andy Johnson-Laird's
The Program,mer's CP/M Handbook, pub by Osborne/McGraw Hill.

I have read just about every book I coyuld find on CP{/M
and that's the best by far.

The Programmer's CP/M Handbook, by Andy Johnson-Laird (Osborne/Mcgraw-Hill)
was reviewed in this month's BYTE, and they say that it was quite good.
If you buy an uninstalled version of CP/M-80 or -86 you should also get lots
of info.  As for MS-DOS, forget it.  They don't believe in giving out info
about it, everything you will get is in the manuals they give you.  If you
have almost no technical information, you could try buying the IBM DOS 2.1
Technical Refrence Manual, but that's about it.  MS-DOS isn't a very good
operating system anyway.

Take a look at "The Programmer's CP/M Handbook" by Andy Johnson-Laird, published
by Osborne/McGraw-Hill.  I read the review of it in the August '84 Byte (pg 90)
and purchased it last week.  I am a fairly experienced CP/M programmer (I have
done a complete port of CP/M to my home-brew Z80 with hard disk and non-standard
floppies), but this book has helped me a lot by revealing some useful
tricks/gotchas and other info which is missing or poorly documented in the DR
manuals.  It also contains a LOT of source, either in ASM or in BDS/C, for a
complete BIOS as well as a bunch of enhanced utilities.  Almost all meat and no
fat!

Why don't you hook the RS-232 serial ports (normally used for a modem)
"back-to-back" and use some version of MODEM/MODEM7/XMODEM on both
machines to do the transfers at 9600 baud?  Here's the gist of how
it's done:

Use any version of Ward Christensen's MODEM program (MODEM7xx, MDM7xx,
MODEM2xx) and connect the two machines together using RS-232 serial
port.  Set the ports for 8 data bits, one stop bit and no parity.
Reverse the connections on pins 2 and 3 on ONE END of the cable
connecting the two machines.  Make sure the baud rate is identical on
both.  Test path using the "T"(terminal) mode on each MODEM program
before trying transfers.  You should be able to type on one machine
and see it on the other.  Set baud rate for highest that will support
error-free transfers (I use 4800 baud).  Initially start at 1200 (or
even 300) baud to debug the connections.  If you use MDM7xx, you'll be
able to use the "B"(batch) mode which allows multiple transfers with
commands specifying ambiguous names (like SB B:*.*).

Subject: ZCPR3 Bugs

	Several bugs have been reported and verified in some ZCPR3
tools.  These bugs will be corrected.  Until such corrections are
issued, however, Echelon is publishing a list of these bugs in their
newsletter so the community will be aware of them and not surprised if
they encounter them.  I will be posting this newsletter (as well as
the others) to the net as I receive them.

	One bug reported with MENU, where when the user strikes an
invalid menu option immediately followed by a CR, is serious enough
(especially for those who want to use MENU for RCPM operation) that
the changes to the source code required to correct this bug will be
posted in a newsletter before the new MENU is released.

	The current plans are to release the Phase 2 software VERY
SOON NOW.  I am cleaning up the doc (HLP files) on Z3LIB and making
sure that all of the doc is in place and correct on the tools.

	The book is coming along ... my publisher is very, very busy
with it.  No major hitches so far.  The book will cover all of the
ZCPR3 software (both phase 1 and phase 2).  I am currently in contract
negotiations for the second book, which is dedicated to the libraries
available under ZCPR3.

	Some time after the Phase 2 release, a "bug disk" will be
released thru Echelon (I will see that a copy gets into SIG/M and
SIMTEL20).  I suspect a 1-2 month gap between Phase 2 and the "bug
disk".  Echelon is acting as THE central, configuration control point
for ZCPR3.  If you want to report an alleged bug or recommend a change
to a tool, please do so thru Echelon.  You can do it thru me, but it
is much, much easier on me if Echelon handles it so that I can go
ahead with the rest of the work and see only one copy of each bug
report/request.

So far, Media Master (about $75, look for add in Byte) has got me back and
forth between an MD3 and a Rainbow.  It claims to do MS-DOS and PC-DOS too.
Actually, the Rainbow version only handles one-sided disks, but the Morrow
can be told to look at one-side only using FOREIGN, and then requesting
MD2.

I once used UNIFORM on Kaypro, and was impressed.  You tell Uniform that b:
is a xxx disk, and then, form then on, it is.  You can run programs, transfer
files, or whatever.  TMedia Master is more self contained--you tell it what
type of disk is on A, what on B, and then can copy, delete, rename, or
whatever.  But you can't run sweep, say.

FILETRAN, which I had some time ago, never worked very well.  But they are on
a later version now.

The Los Angeles city attorney has filed criminal charages against the
Sysop of the Mog-Ur BBS because of credit card numbers posted on his
system. You may recall that his system was previously confiscated by
police and then later returned. At the time the machine was returned
the city attorney said they were not going to file charges for lack of
evidence. It seems great pressure was brought on top levels of the
city attorney's office so they decided to go back on their agreement
not to prosecute. A preliminary hearing has been scheduled for late
next week at which time we should know more about what is going on. I
will keep the net informed as I get news.

The following two messages are related to the current Mog-Ur BBS situation.
There was another messsage along with these asking for donations for a defense
fund, but I am not forwarding it because it might upset the Arpanet people.

To: ALL
Subject: MOG-UR/PACTEL UPDATE (AND I THOUGHT WE WERE THROUGH WITH THIS)! 

	Owing to a difficult work schedule this week and the fact 
that I broke both my ankles, which are now in casts, it 
has been hard for me to quickly determine the facts and post 
same. In addition, my attorney, Chuck Lindner, is trying 
a death penalty case and therefore difficult to reach.
	The info that I have is as follows:
The L.A. City Attorney went back on his word not to prosecute 
and breeched the agreement that he had with my attorney. 
The City Attorney contends that they held a meeting for 
which PacTel flew down to attend, and since we were not 
present they allowed Pactel to present their case alone.
NEITHER CHUCK NOR MYSELF WERE EVER INFORMED OF THIS MEETING!
As a result of that (they claim), they decided that they 
were going to file charges... Chuck has indicated to me 
that political pressure was brought to bear at the very 
highest level of the City Attorneys office and THAT is why 
they suddenly broke their word, did not inform anyone, and 
decided to take the action thay did! Needless to say, Chuck
is furious and told me intends to perform some rearrangement 
of their anatomy as a result of this! He is of the opinion
that this latest action is totally politically motivated.
He also had some other comments and conclusions but
I had best not quote them in an open message! Chuck is taking 
it as a personal afront and has so informed the filing attorney.
I think that I need not mention how I am taking it and
what my position is!
	I will have more information and details this weekend and 
will post them as I learn them. In the meantime, there ARE 
things that anyone who is concerned can do: Write Ira
Reiner, the L.A. City Attorney (Suite 1800, City Hall East,
200 N. Main St., L.A., CA 90012), and let him know exactly
how you feel about this situation specifically and/or
make any favorable comments that you feel appropriate regarding
me and the system. Feel free to lambast him, it is now
more than appropriate! It doesnt have to be a literary work 
of art but write! Also, please copy me with any correspondence
that you may send.  Second, I need to compile a list of
everyone (users and sysops alike) who would be willing to 
attend the arraingement hearing (date TBA) and offer testimony in
my behalf (Chuck would like as many people as possible there
and, more important, at the trial if it goes that far).
	Please tell everyone you know, every sysop, and spread 
these messages around the systems you access all over the 
country! 
	Oh yes, the section of the code that they plan to charge 
me under (I may have listed the number incorrectly earlier) 
is that pertaining to "COMPUTER CRIME USING CREDIT CARDS"...
	Remember!!!  WRITE THE LETTERS TO IRA REINER AND GET ME 
NAMES, ADDRESS, AND TELEPHONE NUMBERS OF THOSE WILLING TO 
TESTIFY!  AND SPREAD THE MESSAGES!

Subject: CHARGES AGAINST TOM <13>

To: all concerned BBS users
From: Peggy Watt, InfoWorld reporter

I thought the telephone company and city of L.A. had decided 
not to press charges against Tom (so did he!) but since 
they have, I'm back to covering the question of sysop 
liability for messages...I'm interested in any and all comments
on the issue, observations, and reports on what other sysops
are doing to protect themselves.  I understand Tom's attorney, 
Chuck Lindner, is relying on good sysop support, and I want 
to follow that, too. 
Feel free to leave me messages/comments on this board, or 
contact me at InfoWorld (800-344-INFO). 
Thanks, Peggy.

The one I' know of is in use taking data from a US weather service line

Subject:  Turbo Pascal patch

Haah,

Several months ago someone requested a patch for Turbo Pascal so that
it would automatically load the error message overlay file without
asking the user first.  Well, this weekend I finally poked around and
wrote a patch for both Z-80 versions (1.0 and 2.0).  In essence, what
happens is that Turbo displays the question, calls a subroutine to
read the response, and stores the response.  The yes_or_no sbr returns
a 0 if the answer was 'N', and non-zero (I didn't check the exact
value) if the answer was 'Y'.  Turbo then loads the message file if
the zero flag is not set.

The patch given below overwrites the call to the "display string"
function and the start of the message.  It clears the A register, adds
one to clear the zero flag, and branches past the call to yes_or_no.
If don't you want to load the error file, change the increment
instruction to a no_op.

When the patched Turbo is run, the copyright message will be displayed
until the error file has been loaded, then it will display the "main"
menu.  If the error file is not being loaded, the c-r message will be
displayed briefly, to be replaced by the main menu.  Remember, this
patch is for the Z-80 versions, altho a similar patch could probably
be used for the IBM version.

NOTE: in the patches below, all user input is in lower case, and
      comments to the patcher are in brackets [].

Note that the above "difference" listing does not show the directory
name (except where the directory is a new one).  If you are not
familiar with the directory naming scheme I'd suggest that you
FTP micro:<cpm>cpm.crclst to your host and scan it with an editor
to find the file(s) of interest.  You will find the full file spec
given therein.

SIMTEL20 supports the ANONYMOUS login under FTP.

Use BDOS when you can. If it is too slow, use BIOS.

Re:   zcpr3 comments/questions

Rick...

Just got zcpr3 up and running on a Discovery Multi Processor...

Great system...  having lots of fun with it... 

1.  HELP.MAC uses COUT from syslib...  COUT goes direct to bios
    thus bypassing BDOS and in particular TAB expansion....
    A regression from prior versions of HELP...  (I just used
    an internal COUT to solve the problem)

Reply:
	The routine BOUT (BDOS Output) in SYSLIB3 can also be used.
BOUT and COUT both output the char in A with no side effects, but BOUT
uses the BDOS while COUT uses the BIOS.

2.  Prior versions of HELP (at least the ones I have) display
    available HLP files on the disk when HELP is typed...
    Why is is this gone?

Reply:
	I was not happy with that feature of HELP.  I removed it for
the following reasons:

		(1) I didn't feel it was used very frequently and it
cost in terms of space
		(2) I didn't like its operation; if the SYSLIB series
of HLP files was in the path, for example, then all 20 of them would
appear as options, but it only makes sense to see SYSLIB.HLP and not
the rest unless you have memorized what SYSLIBA.HLP, etc, contains
		(3) Aliases are fundamental under ZCPR3, and, with
them, a feature like this can be replaced via the FINDF (Find File)
command:
			IF NUL $1
				FINDF *.HLP
			ELSE
				HELP $1
			FI
		(4) the above alias simply "simulates" the older HELP
in this sense; a solution that I prefer is:
			IF NUL $1
				MENU HELPMENU
			ELSE
				HELP $1
			FI
so that a (probably multiple) menu of valid HLP files with their names
as the user would prefer to see them would come up instead


3.  In your sample bios you have an equate symbol CPMDRV which
    is undefined..  I ignored it...  What was it?

Reply:
	CPMDRV is an internal buffer to my BIOS.  It should not have
been in the example.

4.  Is there a ZEX.HLP file available...

Reply:
	Yes.  The file CMDFILES.HLP contains data on both SUB and ZEX.

For those of you who have FTP access to SIMTEL20:

We are now experimentally running a different FTP Server that happens
to have the feature most requested: to be able to use your CWD command
or equivalent (one of the new TOPS-20 FTP programs also allows a SET
DIRECTORY command) to set the default pathname.  (Do not bother giving
a password when it asks for one, as the path is already defaulted at
that point.)

There was an old version around that did not do any dialling or
have terminal emulation.

Is there any improved version?

Also, does anyone know of a program implementing the XMODEM protocol
on a PDP 11/70 running iAS operating system.

Please reply by mail.

Subject: Screen Editor for CP/M
Article-I.D.: ihuxk.732

	After spending a good part of my day using a screen editor, I
have difficulty adjusting to the simple text editor (TED) available
on my system.  Granted, I can use Wordstar, but it leaves some strange
footprints.  I am looking for a good utility editor with which I can
enter text or programs and have screen editing capability.  Can anyone
recommend such a beast that is available on CP/M and for which the 
source is available?
	Thanks in advance for your help.

Article-I.D.: decwrl.3513

I have TURBO Pascal V1 (soon to be V2) on my Apple ][+, and I've been 
playing with direct character input from the keyboard so that I can 
handle such things as the right and left arrows to do funny things.  The 
following code segment is what I've come up with - am I missing 
something or is there really no orthodox way to do it...?

Program Test;

  Type Str80:      string[80];

  Var InputString: Str80;

Function CharGet: char;

  Var KeyBuffer:   char absolute $E000;
      CharGet:     char;

  Begin;
    While not (KeyPressed) do begin;
    End;
    CharGet := KeyBuffer;
  End;

{ The main body begins here }

  Begin;
    InputString := '';
    While (CharGet <> #128) do begin;

      { Mumblefratz, as required }

    End;
  End.

To: info-cpm@BRL.ARPA

I have used MINCE for many years on my CP/M system. It is also available
for the IBM PC which I use at work. It is a (large) subset of the EMACs editor
which is on TOPS-20 which I use at work and FINE which is on the PDP-10 (at
work). Obviously I don't have to keep changing gears too much to do editing
on various systems. Anyways, MINCE used to be available from Mark of the Unicorn.
I think I heard that they weren't selling it anymore but someone else might
have a better pointer. If it is still available I would recommend it. The
other religious camp will no doubt offer wordstart (W*) as a good choice for
screen editors too.

Re PLOT33.  It would not run on my S-100 system -- instead of spaces, it printed
underlines across the display.  But ion a KAYPRO it worked fine.

Traced problem to fact that on my S-100 (and on friend's TELETEK board, too)
the paralell port sends pout only 7 bits, and uses eight bit to strobe
printer.  Have not yet figured out how to fix.

Maybe others are frustrated and do not know why, hence I'm passing
the infor on to you.  You seem to be distributing it, so
you may be a good focal point for such info.

Subject: Macro assemblers for cpm/80 systems
Article-I.D.: decwrl.3520

I'm looking to buy (or simply acquire, if legally possible) a macro assembler
to use on a z80 system running cp/m 2.2 .  One concern is compatibility
with existing public-domain software whose source is available.

I know of the existence of MAC and M80, but I don't know how compatible
they are or which is more widely used for producing public domain software.

I'm also interested in a linker compatible with the assembler, and a symbolic
debugger (ZSID?  what other choices are there?).

I'm willing to pay as much as some prices I've seen advertised for the
DR or Microsoft products; but of course I'm willing to pay less, if there's
something good enough available for less.

Please respond direct to me, and I'll summarize if there's enough interest.

Subject: Problems with MICRO:

The RP06 disk pack which you know as our MICRO: structure apparently
had developed one or more bad spots over the year it has been in
service, and was finally detected sometime last week.  Such latent
errors are not handled well by the system, with one error generating
others and eventually giving the appearance of a degenerating system,
masking the original error, and eventually crashing the system.

The problem was correctly diagnosed yesterday afternoon, and a fresh
disk pack was brought online, initialized, and the MICRO: filesystem
was restored from Friday's full backup and Wednesday night's
incremental backup tapes.  The integrity of the structure was
thoroughly checked and a new backup run was then made and ran to
completion without errors.

In the process, I created the structure with no swapping pages
reserved for system use.  Thus, we have recovered about 7,000
additional disk pages available for still more files to be stored.  We
now have plenty of room for the 16 new SIG/M disks arrived in the
interim.  They will be uploaded next week.  Watch for an announcement.

Those of you who may have experienced difficulty with FTPing files
from MICRO: between last Thursday and yesterday, please try again.  If
you have any problems, let me know.

I have about 300 double-spaced pages of text stored on Atari diskettes
(1050 disk drive).  Anyone have any idea how best to get these files
translated into CP/M formatted disks (in particular, Kaypro II or
Kaypro 4 diskettes).  This is a one time only job, so investing lots
in special software and hardware is a route of last resort.  More
desirable would be some disk conversion house that would do this for a
fee.  Any ideas?

tnx in advance.

uicsl!pollack    Sep  4 15:23:00 1984



Could someone mail me a brief operational description of
an IMSAI VIO board. I have got one without any documentation
and need to know where it sits in memory or IO space, and
what kind of stuff is in the ROM, etc.


Thanks in advance,

Jordan

Subject: Kaypro 4-84 time display program now available

Kaypro 4-84 users will be interested in the KP4TIME2 package.  These
files are now available from SIMTEL20:

	Filename		Type	 Bytes	 CRC

MICRO:<CPM.KAYPRO>
	KP4TIME2.ASM.1		ASCII	 21849  9F1EH
	KP4TIME2.COM.1		COM	   896  C8F0H

...and for those who want the whole package and can FTP ITS-binary files:
	KP4TIME2.LBR.1		COM	 13824  A3E7H

Here's a short description of the program:

CP/M program to display and set the real-time clock on Kaypro 4-84.
Written 04/22/84 by Bob Snider, Columbus Ohio. Greatly expanded 6/30/84.
Display is MM/DD HH:MM:SS and can be 24-hour format or 12-hour with
AM/PM. Date is optional, and the ability to set the clock is optional
for those who want a minimum length module. Customize this assembly
by setting the options in the "Customization section".

The clock is just displayed by the command "TIME". The clock is displayed
and set by anything extra on the command line, ie. "TIME SET". The
program will prompt for date and time value which must be entered as in the
display format. 

Each of the following items can be set independently:

   Date (month/day)
   Day of the week
   Time of day (seconds may be omitted)

If the 12-hour format is on, AM or PM must always follow the time.

Any omitted items are not changed in the clock.

The clock is set at the carriage return. The input line is parsed for
proper format, but not checked for valid dates or times. If nothing is
entered the time is unchanged. If an error is detected, the position of
the error in the string is flagged with a '^' and nothing is set.
The clock is checked to see if an update has occurred while being read,
and it is re-read if so, ensuring valid time displays.

Problems or enhancements should be directed to the Kaypro User's Group on
CompuServe, page PCS-25.

Subject: FTPing ASCII files to ITS

This is probably of interest only to readers on the ITS machines:

Some of the ASCII text files in MICRO: do not appear to have the EOF
^C padding such files are expected to have when read on an ITS
machine.  This is because such files are defaultly and more
efficiently FTP'd in IMAGE mode.  If this is a problem, re-FTP the
file in TEXT mode and the correct padding will be applied in the
process.

(It is probably more technically correct to say that this problem is
more noticable with files that are not close to exact multiples of
1024 PDP-10 words.)

Recent revisions:

8/26/84  2.8  Added equate to support Anchor Signalman Mark XII modem.

		 and accurate SET DELAY processing for Anchor modems.
		 Also incorporated the PARITY, STOPBITS and LENGTH
		 commands from the Norm Saunders overlay (MXO-KP3X) in
		 an attempt to unify the Kaypro MEX overlay identity crisis.
		 The new SET commands are NOT implemented for the 4'84
		 internal modem.  The SET ? command and the SET without
		 arguments correctly distinguishes between the internal
		 and external modem support.          Terry Carroll

8/03/84  2.7	 Added call to DISCON: (disconnect routine) in the
		 Smartmodem dialing routine at SMDMOFF:.  It appeared that
		 when either the delay timer timed out or a CTRL -C
		 abort coincided with a connect, the modem did 
		 connect, even though the overlay responded with
		 NO ANSWER. Added these calls to make sure there
		 is no unannounced connect.	John C. Smith

Fowler:

Msg 132 is 12 line(s) on 09/08/84 from BOB SANDEL
to RON FOWLER about MODIFIED SM-13 TO STOP HANGUPS

Ron, Although the SM-13 overlay worked quite well for me with MEX10,
I started experiencing a lot of Anchor XII hangups when I implemented
MEX111.  Seems like MEX111 is too fast to allow a proper disconnect of
the Anchor.  I experimented and have U/L MX-SM13A (A for Anchor) which
has added 3 CALLs to DISCON before turning control back to MEX111.
Seems to works a lot better for me---let's see how others do with the
alteration.  I speeded up the DISCON times to 1.2 seconds from 2.0
seconds.  Still having some difficulty recogninzing a Control C when
in the auto-repeat dial mode.  Currently only about 50% effective.
Thx for a powerful modem executive. Bob

MXO-SY20.ASM is a MEX overlay for the Sanyo MBC-1000 Computer.

THIS OVERLAY MAKES USE OF TIMER 2 OF THE 8253 PROGRAMMABLE INTERVAL
TIMER (IC4) ON THE SERIAL I/O BOARD OF THE SANYO MBC-1000 AND REQUIRES
A HARDWARE MODIFICATION.

The overlay allows use the "SET" command to change the baudrate when
desired.  It starts out at 1200 baud when the program is first called
up.  Only 300 & 1200 Baud are enabled; info for other baudrates is
provided in table form in the overlay.

The SET command allows the user to change the baud rates, and the
parity.  The parity options are: No parity (NONE); Even parity (EVEN);
Even parity with 8 data bits (EVEN8); Odd parity (ODD); and Odd parity
with 8 data bits (ODD8).  EVEN8 and ODD8 are for special purposes and
will most likely never be used.

This code looks quite similar to a test version of PUBPATCH I released
late last spring.  Who's the contributor, and what's the background?

An article documenting the patch we developed at Plu*Perfect Systems is
scheduled for a fall Dr. Dobbs issue.  It includes code for a PUBLIC utility
to set/reset the public bit & list public files.  A disk is available with
an augmented SD to list public files in a separate 'public' directory.

Without some further bdos patches the patch you released will probably
suffer from the  weak points that we had to overcome in our initial version
of the public-attribute-bit approach:  era *.* will wipe out public files
from any user number, and dir  will show public files in every user number.
The Dr. Dobbs version handles this well-- public files have a type of SYStem
status and are accessible only by unambiguous filename or search-for-next
function.

Our approach is copyrighted, but we will be releasing it for non-commercial,
single-user use to the CP/M community.  SIMTEL20 availability would also
be fine; the documentation is the article, and I would have to check
with the editor about release before publication.

	Your problem stems from the BIOS in the Kaypro not
implementing the List Status call properly. There has been
considerable discussion on this in the past; few programs use the
status call because more than a few BIOS authors have been remiss in
not including same.
	There are probably several solutions depending on your
expertise. You might patch it yourself, go to the Kaypro Sig on
Compuserve and ask for a patch, etc.

Anchorman has either a bug, or a safeguard that if the +s pass through
at full speed (as they would in an ESC+T type transfer), the modem
ignores them.  I put in a patch to call a delay of 6 in the timer
sequence between the ''+''s and doubled all the other delays in the
disconnect sequence and it works at least 95% of the time.  The way to
solve the ^C problem is that the Anchorman will not abort on (CR), it
needs an A.  I modified it to send (CR), pause, ''A'', pause, ''T'',
pause and then (CR).  Works all the time, except while the Anchorman
is still sending back the numbers (ie still dialing) (the Anchorman
echoes each character back as it is dialed).  Another thing that
should be down with the MEx overlay is to increase the timeout (which
is default 60 seconds).  Since the Anchorman waits 36 seconds before
hanging up and some ALD pauses coul make up the rest to 60, sometimes
it times-out too soon.

A quick call to directory resistance gave their number as:
(617)576-2760. I called, and got infinite ringing (not strange,
considering it was a sunday). And we still pay royalties to
them everytime we send out a Unix system with Mince and/or
Scribble on it, so I assume they're alive. They certainly were
as of the last time I went out to the American Twine Building to
fix their CADR.

Hi,

	I understand that Echelon has fully installed ZCPR3 on the
Kaypro-10 already.  You might want to contact them for details.  Frank
Gaude and I were talking about it the other day, and he said it took a
lot of internal knowledge that Joe Wright, the guy who worked with
Frank to do the installation, had.  Joe writes BIOSes as part of his
work in Sunnyvale.

I have been trying to use uc14.c from micro:<unix.cpm> to exchange text
files with a cp/m system using mdm730.  I have successfully sent files
to the unix system, but all attempts to receive files have failed.
What I have done is to send the unix machine the command to send a file.
Then I escape to the mdm730 command mode  and ask to recieve the file.
What I get is an attempt to transfer, but with a message " Illegal character
in header".  If I don't try to receive the file to a cpm disk file, but supply
a NAK from the keyboard, a block is sent to the screen. Sending non-NAK's
causes the block to repeat and sending ACK causes the next block to be sent,
as expected.  Anyone have an idea about what I might be doing wrong????

Thanks,

Subject: dBASE II on a VAX
To: info-cpm@AMSAA.ARPA

I've been attempting to use dBASE II on a VAX (MOUSE@USC-ECL).  In
setting up a database, I discovered an upper limit of 431 records; I
can enter more than 431, but any attempt to sort or index the
database, or to edit any additional records, results in the program
screaming RECORD OUT OF RANGE.

Considering that dBASE II itself states that it has an upper limit of
some 65,000 records with 32 fields, and I'm only using 6 fields, 431
records is quite a reduction and renders the program pretty useless as
far as I'm concerned.  Has anybody else had this problem, or can
suggest ways of fixing it or getting around it?

said was that it looked good in a show.

If anybody out there is has used one, what I want to know is: Is it easy to

I bought an Ampro 'Little Board' computer - and while I have no complaints
about the hardware, they have come up with a new twist in software.

Manuals are optional.

One of the reasons I went with this outfit was that they prominently advertised
that CP/M 2.2 came with the board.  They did not mean the manuals, however.
When I asked about this, the response was a list of CP/M books, including
Digital Research.  I can buy the standard manuals for $35.

Selling software without manuals is ridiculous (except maybe to Mr. Pournelle,
then he couldn't have any negative comments about the documentation :-)  ).


Just thought you might like to know . . . .

I once had this happen to me when a power glitch messed up my file.
Everything looked ok when doing a

  disp struct

(i.e. the correct number of records was displayed), but an append would
end with the

  RECORD NUMBER OUT OF RANGE

message.

I fixed my problem by doing a pack, which ended up with one fewer
records than I should have had. Then I found the missing record and
inserted it back in where it belonged.

The new Apple //c is much the same - except they try to give the
impression that you don't really have to know anything more than
how to turn it on, insert the disk and boot.

So the manual tell *very* little more thatn that!

(*Do* you have to know anything more than that anyway?? - Nope.
As long as you never want to do anything more than turn it on,
insert the disk and boot!)

    	Newsletter 5 is now stored in MICRO:<CPM.ZCPR3> on SIMTEL20 as
    Z3NEWS.005.  All of the newsletters are now named Z3NEWS.nnn to match
    Echelon's convention.

The new naming is going to cause a problem for all RCPM operators who
would normally store these files SQueezed.  It will be Z3NEWS.0Q5,
which means when the news letters get to number 10 there will be a
duplication of all the file names from that point onward.  I liked the
old naming convention - it came out xxx.ZQ

    Re:   Inside CP/M tutoral files now available

    Re your note in INSIDCPM files...Looks like they are all short,
    and all interesting.  It would save a lot of time and work if it
    is possible for you to combine them into a .LBR file, so that one
    can download at one crak.  I do not mean removing the individual
    files; rather, adding a LBR file that contains them all.

Good idea, Eric.  The .LBR is now available for those who can FTP
ITS-binary files from SIMTEL20 and want the whole package.

I am lookimg for graphics primitives for the TEK 401x machines that can be
made to run on a Rainbow (cpm-80 or 86). Preferably in C or Pascal.

I don't need anything really fancy, or even well-documented.

I'll summarize responses, if it looks interesting.  thanks

SOmeone asked about MINCE?  Carnegie-Mellon used to hand out MINCE and
SCRIBBLE for about $100, but now they seem to have switched to an
editor named EPSILON (also EMACS like).

I believe that PERFECTWRITER's editor, and THE FINAL WORD's editor
are also very emacs like.

Also, thanks to all responses for OSBORNE VS. EMACS.  The O almost runs
EMACS well now.  Summary forthcoming...

The Final Word is NOT EMACS-like; it uses a two dimensional control
structure of verb-noun (e.g., DELETE WORD).

	I've got two Tandom TM100-4 drives (5.25" DSDD 96TPI) I want
to send out.  One needs an alignment,  the other needs more (I think).

	Does anyone have any experience with the repair by mail places

a LOGO for the Rainbow, and realized that such information
represents an important starting point.

any suggestions?

Use FTP with user name anonymous to log on to SIMTEL-20.  Use any
printable string as password ( I found this out today...used to use
anonymous as the password).  Look at docs on your system for FTP.  You
do need to know how to move around and get directories.

Subject: FTNOTE14 WordStar footnoter now available

FTNOTE, the footnote program for use with WordStar, has been updated
to version 1.4 and is now available from SIMTEL20.  A short list of
the updates and a general description of the program follow the
directory listing:

Filename			Type	 Bytes	 CRC

Directory MICRO:<CPM.WSTAR>
	FTNOTE14.COM.1		COM	 17408  F366H
	FTNOTE14.DOC.2		ASCII	 25756  D58DH
	FTNOTE14.DQC.1		COM	 16256  10D7H
	FTNOTE14.HEX.1		ASCII	 42382  449BH
	FTNOTE14.INF.1		ASCII	  1457  3BC1H

Version 1.4 incorporates several improvements over the previous
version 1.33 of FTNOTE.COM.  The DOC file has been updated
accordingly.

ADDITIONAL FEATURES:

(1)  Larger page numbers are now supported (up to 999).  The page
    number reference syntax has been changed accordingly, and is
    no longer compatible with that of versions 1.3x.
(2)  Larger footnote numbers (up to 999) are now available as an
    option.  (Old style numbers to 99 are still supported.)
(3)  The footnote separator line length can now be adjusted by a
    user patch.  In addition, if the character "_" is used, this
    line will no longer collide with footnote superscripts.

MINOR BUGS FIXED:

(1)  "-e" and "-r" modes now allow "#1" to remain in footnotes.
    Previously "-e" replaced "#1" with "##" in the notes.  This has
    no effect on format mode, but caused misnumbered end notes, when
    "-n" mode was used.
(2)  The ".FI" dot command now looks for the specified file on the
    same drive as the original file.  Previously it looked on the
    default drive, even if a drive was specified on the command line.
(3)  Attempts to set an already set page marker now generate the
    error message "! duplicate ref".  Previously the original setting
    was simply overridden.

     FTNOTE.COM is a formatting utility for WordStar files.  Its main
function is to allow the printing of WordStar documents with page-bottom
footnotes, but it does internal page referencing and improved block
formatting as well.
     FTNOTE will automatically move your footnotes into and out of your
text file; number them for use as end notes; or produce a printable file
with them at page bottom.
     FTNOTE is an effective but simple program.  It does NOT attempt to
duplicate the existing capabilities of WordStar: editing, justification,
or printing.  It is a utility to be used in conjunction with WordStar.

FEATURES:   * simple, natural file format
	    * automatic separation of text and notes
	    * will produce end notes or footnotes as desired
	    * automatic footnote numbering
	    * numbering can match up across multiple files
	    * page-mode or continuous footnote numbers
	    * long notes will continue on next page
	    * many formatting options allow flexible results
	    * automatic internal page reference numbering
	    * useful improved figure-block formatting
	    * can be run FROM WORDSTAR with Main Menu "R" command

The reason for selling the manual separately is not to rook the
individual buying only one.   It prevents the person or business
that buys truckloads from having to buy more manuals than they need.
If I was selling a special purpose computer and my customer didn't
need the manual, I sure wouldn't want one per board.  Hopefully they
made it very clear in their add though, because I'd also be ticked if
I bought a single board and was SURPRISED buy not getting the manual.

Subject:  Epson PX-8 (Geneva) review
To: ARPEE@mit-mc.ARPA, INFO-CPM@mit-mc.ARPA
cc: STEVEH@mit-mc.ARPA

Let me preface this with the comment that I was only able to get close enough
to play with this unit for about 10 minutes, so this will not be a thorough
review.  My frame of reference is my NEC-8201A lap computer.

The unit seems to be well constructed, and about the size of a piece of paper
(nominally 8.5 by 11") and less than 2" thick.  It has two stubs that rotate
from the back to become feet that adjust the angle of the keyboard.  The
keyboard is relatively quiet, and has a short row of function keys above it
(five PF keys and <ESC> <PAUSE> and <STOP> keys).  It has four arrow keys, and
I believe that I saw two control keys.  There is a removable cover that
protects the keys when the unit is not being used.

The display is 80x8, with better resolution than the HP Portable that I saw
three weeks ago.  The display rotates up from a face-down protective position
into several detented positions.  Additionally, there is a control on the
display that adjusts the "viewing angle".

The big selling point that I had heard about was the unit runs CP/M on a Z-80
chip, and has several bundled software products on ROM chips.  There are slots
for two ROM chips to be loaded at a time, and they are treated as ROM-disk
drives B: and C:.  There is 15K RAM disk available as drive A: and a 3.5"
firmly-disk (well, it certainly isn't a floppy!) a la' the Macintosh, that
plugs into the back and becomes drive D:.  I was not impressed by the data
transfer rate of the disk.  I believe I saw something that said that it was
running at 38.4 Kbs, but I may be wrong.  There is a CP/M utility ROM-disk
with: STAT, PIP, PXMODEM, TERM, etc.  Another one has a slimmed down version
of Wordstar, although I think that this one will be harder to learn, since the
^J help menues are among the missing.  There are two additional ROM drives
that I wasn't able to see: a scheduling program (by Micro-pro), and a
spreadsheet program.  There is also an internal micro-cassette tape recorder,
but I was not able to discern how it was operated, in the time available to
me.

So far, so good.  If it weren't for the following I would have walked out
of there with one (which isn't quite true, since they had none in stock, but
they would be delivered Real Soon Now).  The 15K RAM drive just isn't big
enough for my needs (up to two weeks on the road before I can dump data back
into my Molecular Multicomputer,) and the only way that you can upgrade is by
60 and 120K external units.  (One of the reasons that I was looking into the
Geneva, was the NEC is just about an inch too thick to fit in my briefcase, so
I must carry it.)

Another BIG boo, is the fact that they have chosen to go non-standard on their
RS-232.  They use what appears to be a mini-DIN plug.  They have cables that
adjust from their plug to DB-25s, but they are male plugs, so I would need at
least a gender-mender in addition to their $30 one-foot cable.  I asked the
Epson (not the dealer's) technical representative if the information to craft
my own cable came with the unit, he "thought" so.

I noticed no battery-low indicator on the unit, and the display documentation
said that if "you turned the unit on and the display didn't show anything, it
was time to recharge the unit."  I certainly would hope that the screen
doesn't die on me after I had been working on a report for several hours.  I
asked if there were a spare battery pack that you could carry with you, but the
tech rep said that he would have to get back to me on that.

My bottom-line opinion: for some people, an adequate lap-portable, and I feel
that Epson came close to making me part with my money, but I believe that I
will wait until they make further adjustments.

I think that your listing of additions/changes to SIMTEL will
be useful after the directories are printed with the files, but
until we can get a short description of the files on SIMTEL it
is sometimes like having all of the definitions and spellings
in a dictionery just placed out in a pile in front of us.

Yes Steve, it would be nice to have at least a one line description
of each of the files such as exists for the micro:<sigm> files.  It looks
like a rather formidable task to prepare such a Catalog file as one
would have to download and read most of the DOC files and probably
some of the ASM files as well.  Would be most practical to develop
such a Catalog file directly on SIMTEL, where all the files are.  Perhaps
someone with access to that system will volunteer to do that.

As it is, the crc difference files that I have been generating and
distributing will be most useful to those who follow the micro:<cpm>
files rather closely and want to know when new versions of familiar
programs show up on SIMTEL20.

I'm gonna mull this over and maybe come up with something to
make the subject messages more informative.

Thanks for your feedback.

Subject: MODEL II TRSDOS (Scriptsit II) => CP/M transfers?

Although our secretary does very well at remembering the command sets
for three different editors, we would like to cut it down to two...

You see, we have a bunch of files on Scriptsit II disks for a TRS-80
Model II.  We would like to copy them over to CP/M disks on the same
machine to have the documents eventually usable with WordStar.  The
one utility we have doesn't seem to like these Scriptsit disks (maybe
because they are double density, or not "real" TRSDOS disks, or ...)

So, we would like to know if such a CP/M utility exists that would
make the conversion, if it is in the public domain, and where can we
get/buy a copy of the program?

Thanks,

I have been having trouble getting Xmodem93 to work on my Kaypro IV. I have
been using the overlay for Zilog S-I/O which says it will work with a
Kaypro and an external modem. It seems to work fine until I run it under
RCPM and then for some reason it doesn't work. After it is run it waits
until someone types something and then gives the standard Xmodem message
about sending or receiving files but then it just sits there and spins
the disk drive. Does anyone have any ideas?

Allow me to clarify some of the points on the Epson Geneva/PX-8 lap
machine.
The ram disk on the standard unit may be optionally sized from 0-24K,
stealing the ram from the 64K main memory. There are several accessory
units available, including 60K or 120K ram disks as well as an MFU
(multifunction unit) that includes 60K ram disk, a 300 baud atodial
modem, and another rom socket. The latter item is not released yet,
and I am waiting for it. I agree that a ram disk accessory is a must.
There is a small program that access the built-in A to D to read the
battery voltage and graphically report the state of its charge.
Lastly, the RS-232 port is 100% standard except for the connector. The
cable is well made and connects directly to my stand-alone modem,
prionter, or computer for file transfers.
As you can tell, I'm quite happy with the PX-8.

Good point, Keith.  Will probably change the naming convention to
something that falls in line with the squeezing convention.

In-reply-to: Msg of 13 Sep 1984  16:27-MDT from Dick <MEAD at USC-ECLB.ARPA>

	The book on PD software I received was called "The Free
Software Handbook, 1984-1985 CP/M Edition", and it is written by T.
Gregory Platt, Patricia Hatcher, and Blake Van Meter.  It is published
by Peopletalk Associates, Inc, PO Box 863652, Plano, TX  75086.  They
want $17.95 for it.

	It documents about 70 programs that the authors felt were
especially good.  These included games, directory assistance programs,
library utilities, communications programs (mainly SMODEM53), and
hacker's tools.  New SWEEP 205, DISK76, CLEANUP, RPIP, UNERA,
SUPERSUB, DISPLAY, LISTT, VLIST, HELP (generic), BANNER, POSTER,
GOTHIC, PASSWORD, SCRAMBLE, SORTV, SPELL, UNSPOOL, LU, CAT, SMODEM53,
IDUMP, DU-V86, I/O-CAP, and ZCPR2 (in general).

	I really enjoyed the book and feel it is well-written.  I was
not aware of some of the programs they covered (like LISTT and VLIST).
The reading was light and easy, even fun.

Subject: FIXTEX12.ASM ascii file filter utility update

Date: Sunday, 16 September 1984
From: Eric Stork <STORK at MIT-MC>
To:   W8SDZ
Re:   FIXTEX12.ASM

I HAVE JUST UPLOADED FIXTEX12.ASM.

FIXTEX12 has a couple of bug fixed: One to allow assembly with MAC,
which allows nested IFs and therefore rejected an open IF statement,
and one to make sure that the high bit is stripped in all options.
(Some of the options that test a flag restore the byte from trhe input
buffer after the ANI 7Fh - that in effect resets the high bit if it
was set in the first place -- the bug fix just puts the reset byte
into the IBUF before going on to other option).

This program by PLK@MIT-MC, based on your FILTEX, is remarkably
useful.  I came back to it time and again to built a new tool that I
may need.  It surely ought to be in any list of all time winners in
the PD.
Eric

The program is now available from SIMTEL20:

Subject: XMODEM97 for RCPMs now available

XMODEM, the remote console program for RCPMs, has been updated to
XMODEM97.  It's now available from SIMTEL20:

Filename			Type	 Bytes	 CRC

Directory MICRO:<CPM.RCPM>
XMODEM97.AQM.1			COM	 55680  1824H
XMODEM97.ASM.1			ASCII	 83216  0E46H
XMODEM97.DOC.1			ASCII	  7189  FFDDH

Here's what's new since XMODEM93:

; 09/10/84  Added conditional code to set WRTLOC to prevent hangups
;   v9.7    in the middle of a transfer and also fixed console
;	    key function check to be conditional and also done during
;	    WAITNAK and wait for SOH in RCVRECD.   - Kim Levitt
;
; 07/26/84  Added code to switch to CHECKSUM mode after the 5th
;   v9.6    initial timeout to accommodate users of software packages
;	    which don't support CRC protocol (and whose operators
;	    are unaware of the differences).	- Sigi Kluger
;
; 07/20/84  More ZCPR2 support added-
;   v9.5    If ZCPR2 = YES then the NO COMS (Rec or send), NO $SYS,
;           and NO #s are all set to NO if the Wheel byte at 03eh is
;           non-zero (set).  Also the transfer MAXTIM routine and
;           also the TIMEON maximum will both be unlimited.  If you 
;           are using ZCPR2, why not really use it.  Also had 
;           previously added a local console keyboard status check
;           which someone cleaned up a bit.
;                                       - Steve Sanders
;
; 07/10/84  Simple change made at request of many Sysops:
;   v9.4	ZCPR2's path will no longer conflict with TIMEON routines.
;	    CWM had set up the time routines to store info in lowmem, this
;	    has been changed.  Now, a routine called GETTIME will return
;	    the time in registers instead of peeking lowmem.
;					- Paul Traina
;
; 07/04/84  Fixed timing circuits to handle 2400, 4800, 9600 AND 19200
;   v9.3    bps modems.  Other trivial changes.  (A few RCPM are now
;	    using 2400 bps and one is using 4800 bps.)  Incorporated
;	    George Peace's modification to XMDMROOM.PCH to correctly
;	    display CP/M Plus space remaining on disk.
;					- Irv Hoff 

For those who want to know what XMODEM is:

This program allows a remote user to transfer files (to or from) a
RCPM facility.  Files may be loaded to a specific user area, keeping
all new programs in that one area.  This aids the SYSOP as well as the
remote user.  If uploading a .COM file, an option changes it
automatically to an .OBJ file.  This security feature prevents
intentional uploading of programs that could be used to alter (or
erase, etc.) those already present.

SYSOPs may use MAXTIM to set the time limit for downloading files.  It
prevents users from tying up the system for excessive lengths of time
with slow modems.  For instance, 30 minutes limits 300 baud users to
about 48k.  MAXTIM does not kick them off, it stops them from starting
to download a lengthy file.  Current versions of BYE3 further limit
the user to one hour total time (or whatever the SYSOP specifies), so
numerous downloads of short files are not possible.  Current versions
of BYE3 can also prohibit operation of baud rates slower than 300 bps
during prime hours (such as 6-11 pm) as specified by the SYSOP.

XMODEM allows programs to be uploaded to a non-public area for private
use of the SYSOP.  (Use "RP" or "RPC" for the private area.)	It also
allows private programs to be downloaded from a special area, giving
the SYSOP the ability to make any person a temporary privileged user.
(A private note tells the person the name of the file.  Others would
be unaware such a file existed, insuring excellent security.)

Individual files from a library group may be downloaded.  The library
extent (.LBR) need not be included, in which case it is automatically
added.  Using library groups permits greater utilization of the avail-
able disk space, plus puts all associated files into the same program.
An example is shown in the menu.

Since there are so many different computer/modem combinations, you are
expected to select one of the external overlays available to match the
equipment being used (or make your own).  First, select the general
options desired on this program and assemble it.  ASM.COM is suitable.
Then use LOAD to get a .COM file.  Edit the appropriate external over-
lay and assemble it to get a .HEX file.  DDT (or SID, etc.) would be
used to merge the two into your final working .COM file.  (The infor-
mation on how to do this is contained in the external patch file.  It
is easier and quicker to do than it may appear.  Follow instructions
included in each overlay.)

Subject: New version of MODEM for TOPS-20

Frank Wancho has released a new version of MODEM (302) for TOPS-20.
It is now available from SIMTEL20:

Filename			Type	 Bytes	 CRC

Directory MICRO:<CPM.TOPS-20>
MODEM.EXE.302			ASCII	 20480  825FH
MODEM.MAC.302			ASCII	 48121  5A5BH

This version has ALL of the timeout and error recovery features of
MDM730 as modified by PAT730V8.

There are 27 changes detailed at the front of the source file.  All
previously known bugs are fixed in this version.  One new bug has been
introduced and remains to be found and fixed: in batch receive mode
(with respect to the mainframe end), the first sector of each file
transfered is NAK'd.  This does NOT occur in single-file receive mode
and thus remains a mystery.  Frank considered this minor and decided
not to hold up this release until he found it.

A reminder for TAC users: unless your TAC port's input buffer has been
set to 134 characters instead of the default 64, there is no hope of
ever being able to upload at speeds higher than 300 bps.  If you don't
know the setting of your port, check with your TAC Liaison as listed
by the NIC WHOIS program for TACname-TAC.

Also, it is strongly recommended that you give your TAC the following
three commands before attempting to open a connection:

@D C A
@F O E
@F I E

Since it appears that it is possible to have flow control exerted by
the TAC even while in binary mode, you must shut that feature off to
have any hope of transferring files at any speed.  (You must do this
sequence even if you are starting a new connection with your TAC as
the person(s) before your may have left either or both of those
features on.  They are NOT reset by an @R or @L or hangup.)

Bug reports and whatnot concerning this new version of MODEM to
WANCHO@SIMTEL20.

Hi --

	ZCPR3 Phase 2 went out to Echelon today.  It looks like Beta
Testing and online doc is finally done.  Should know for sure in a day
or two.

	Phase 2 includes the following:

		VFILER for ZCPR3
		VMENU for ZCPR3
		DU3 for ZCPR3
		MU3 for ZCPR3 (MEMORY UTILITY)
		DEBUG.RCP - MU3 in an RCP, which can be used as a shell
		Other miscellaneous tools

		Z3LIB - complete source code and HLP
		VLIB - complete source code and HLP

	Source and object were included with all tools.  Only DEBUG.RCP
needs to be reassembled.  The others can be installed by naming them in
an INS file and running Z3INS on them.

	VFILER, VMENU, DU3, and MU3 are screen-oriented and use the Z3TCAP
facility.

	ZCPR3 Phase 2 will be released thru SIG/M as Phase 1 was.

	I have what I hope is a relatively easy question for some CP/M expert
out there in netland, I'm trying to use SUBMIT and XSUB to run a program
and have several initialization commands executed in that program. Normally
the program is run:

	A>master
	program herald prints here
	&some input
	&some more
	& . .
	& . .
	&term			a command to enter a terminal emulation mode

The submit file I thought would work is:

	xsub
	master
	some input
	some more
	.
	.
	term


What happens is:

	A>submit mstr

	A>XSUB

	A>MASTER
	program herald prints here

Does anyone know anything about MODEM730 for CDOS?
I tried MDM730 and the M7CD-2 overlay, but according
to reports from the user, it uses CPM BDOS calls that
arent in CDOS...

Please respond directly to me, as I am no longer on info-cpm.

To: INFO-CPM@mit-mc.ARPA


I'm a Xerox 820-II 16/8 user, and I'm trying to set up my RCP/M making
use of the 16/8's co-processor. I can use one processor, say, to assemble
a program, and the other to work on word processing, but I when I try to
use one processor for NON-disk I/O, it just sits there. I.e., it seems
that the processors will work at the same time only during disk I/O.
To make it short -- If someone logs onto my system while I'm word processing
on the co-processor (BYE on Z-80, myself on 8086), they can't use the
system. It hangs. If I press CTRL/RET to get back to the Z-80, they can.

Is there a way to let them use the system while I use the other processor?
(are there even any 16/8 users there??) Maybe this is just the way dual
processors work; I'm a novice as far as knowing how the things work, but
it seems like an annoying "feature".

				Please mail directly, not through INFO-CPM.

I am trying to write a dBase program that will allow rapid indexed

up to (say) 100 characters of keywords, and then I want to be able to
display all records that include a particular keyword of interest
WITHOUT going through a record by record search.  All the ways I can
think of to do this are very clumsy.  Anyone with good ideas out
there?

Many bibliography management programs do this, but without knowing
about their quality, I'm hesitant to go that way.

thanks in advance.  I will post replies to anyone who want them.

The following is based on working with the PX-8.

> There is 15K RAM disk available as drive A:.

The RAM disk can be set to as high as 24K, but some programs won't run
with it at the maximum.  In any case, 24K is still too small.  A separate
60K or 64K RAM disk is available and, I think, mandatory.  The separate
RAM disks attach to the base unit making a very nice package.  They do ad
~$500 to the price though.

I don't have the disk, but that is the rate given in the manual.  Haven't seen
the disk even, but at that rate they certainly would be slow.

Almost certainly true.  The version of Wordstar will be very easy to use
for anyone who's used it on a larger machine -- only a few things are missing.
One annoyance:  because the menus are missing, it's not possible to see
the state of various toggles that are normally displayed on the ^O menu.

The scheduling program looks real nice, but it stores the schedule in an
expandable area of main memory.  Other programs may interfere and this
area is definitely less secure than a file (even on RAM disk) would be.
The spreadsheet program is similar to SuperCalc (not to CalcStar!) but
much more limited.  The cassette, for the most part, looks like a disk and
is operated as the H: drive.  There are some limitations like no random
access (random access BDOS calls are supported provided that the records
are actually read in order starting from the first) and only one file
open at a time on the tape.  The tape is, however, very slow.  It's not
really practical to work from it, so these restrictions aren't all that
important.

The information for making cables is in the manual.  Even so, I'll second
the boo.  The last thing I needed was more RS232 cables.

If you are working with the machine and the battery get's low, it displays
the message "Charge Battery" and locks up.  No warning.  An extra battery
pack should be no problem -- just order the replacement battery -- it just
plugs in, but it would be a bit of a nuisance as I don't believe Epson provides
any external way to charge the battery.  One could, of course, find or build
a charger.  There is a public domain program to check the battery condition;
this helps, but, since you have to run it to check, is not nearly as good
as a warning system.

A few quibbles not contained in the original posting:

There is no parallel printer port.  This is strange since RS232 is not
standard on Epson printers.  WordStar (and some other things) are configured
for Epson printers and are not changable.

The technical documentation is not adequate.  There is nothing on accessing
the I/O ports except from BASIC.

Not all of the standard CP/M utilities are included.  It is arguable that
those not included aren't appropriate on a lap top, but I feel that if they
are advertising CP/M they should give it to you.

My bottom-line opinion: for some people, an adequate lap-portable, and I feel
that Epson came close to making me part with my money, but I believe that I
will wait until they make further adjustments.

I do like the machine very much though.  My base point is the Radio Shack
Model 100 (essentially the same as the NEC).  Languages other than BASIC are
supported.  Unless you have the diskette drives, it would be difficult to
run a compiler on the PX-8 (Turbo Pascal may be an exception), but it's no
trick to compile on another machine and move it to the PX-8.  Standard
CP/M software runs quite nicely (subject, of course, to disk space and
screen limitations).  Once you do figure out how to use it, I/O to the
RS232 is easier and more flexible than I've seen on any other micro.

All in all, I'd say that in spite of some flaws, the PX-8 is an excellant
portable machine, particularly for someone who has another CP/M system.

is there a version of squeeze and unsqueeze that is Dec-10/20 and CP/M
compatible?  Simply, I want to squeeze a DEC-10 data file, bring it
down with, say, Kermit, and then Unsqueeze it.

thanks

There are two different kinds of ultraviolet tubes available--short
wave and long wave.  The kind used to illuminate posters, etc. are
long wave.  The kind used to erase EPROMS are short wave.  Short wave
UV is the component of sunlight which causes tanning (and sunburn, and
skin cancer), so you have to be very careful not to look at a short
wave UV lamp.  I've been using a General Electric G8T5 8-watt
germicidal tube with very good results.  If you want to build an
eraser from scratch then you'll also need an 8-watt ballast and an
FS-5 starter.  There are some back issues of BYTE magazine which
describe the construction of an EPROM eraser.  However, at least one
of these articles INCORRECTLY suggests using a long-wave UV lamp.  The
easiest way (and probably cheapest way) to build an EPROM eraser is to
buy the G8T5 tube and put it in an inexpensive fluorescent desk lamp
which already contains the correct ballast, starter, sockets, cord and
power switch.

Good luck and have fun.  Let me know if you need more information.

    I have been using an excellent version of SWEEP by Dave Rand.  (Only 16K,
    and some useful features I haven't seen on others, like the ability to
    Erase Tagged files.)

    I wanna contact him.  Anyone know his address??

Yes, it's in the .DOC file for NSWP.

I'm planning to try MCI's TELEX  link to communicate with
clients.  But I need to know about TELEEX codes (Baudot ??).
Anyone have a pointer to those codes?  Sure would appreciate
knowing of a file on SIMETL20, or elsewhere, that can explain
what is available for TELEX.

Thanks,

 I aggree - KWOC (keyword out of context) searches in dbase II are
very clumsy.  What I've done is to separate the keywords into
a separate field per keyword and cycle through the indexes for 
a search.

 Updateing (or adding records) becomes slow and involves re-indexing
if one has more than seven indexes with standard dBase II.4 - I
believe III has more capibility for simulataneous indexes.

 If you find a more elegant method - please tell!

Why not just use MCI Mail. You can send a receive TELEX (and TWX)

You are probably slightly out of date with reference to monthly
charges on Western Union Telex. Their Easy-Link service has no monthly
charges whatsoever and is much more flexible both in terms of types of
messages and structure of the system than is MCI Mail. There is no
application fee and they supply two thick volumes of Telex numbers.

Does anyone have experience with MAXTOR hard disk drives.  They supply
drives with capacities that range from (get this) 65-380 megabytes
unformatted on 5 1/4 disks (up to 8 platters in a drive).  I've got
their literature but would like to hear from someone with personal
experience.  S-100 is selling the 140M version for about $4k.

No other manufacturer comes close to that capacity for that price.  It
almost sounds too good to be true.

The attached listing, taken from the SIMTEL20 file MICRO:<CPM>CPM.CRCLST,
shows the contents of the directory MICRO:<CPM.SQUSQ>, which contains the
programs for squeezing and unsqueezing files on a CP/M machine.  Navigation
through the SIMTEL20 archives is explained in the "archive blurb" entitled
"The SIMTEL20 Archives".  If you would like a copy, just send me a note and
I'll be happy to send it along.

     Since you specifically mentioned wanting source code, the files with
names ending in ".C" will probably be of most interest.  I also recommend
the ".DOC" files for general information.  In the attached listing, the fields
following the filename contain the file-type, file-size in characters or bytes,
and the cyclic redundancy code (CRC) for error-checking your download.  Enjoy.

Subject: Copying files containing 'holes'

Under CP/M 2.2,..., files written by random access may contain 'holes'--
logical data records that have never been written.  A number of
utilities don't seem to handle this situation well.

PIP copies only at most some of the written records, missing those in higher
directory extents.

SD reports 'virtual' file size -- the number of blocks (in Kbytes)
required if the file consisted entirely of written records.  It's easy
to get multi-megabyte sizes reported.

What 'should' a well-behaved utility do  -- i.e. what's the most useful
filesize report, and which records should be copied?  On first thought,
it seems that the size should be number of *allocated* blocks (in Kbytes)
and the copy should consist of exactly those blocks, except that in the final
block only the records <= last record of file should be copied.

Have other utilities already worked this out?

Just picked up a spare computer, TRS Model 4P at $995. It runs CP/M 2.2,
but requires booting with image first. I noticed that the CP/M Plus for
Model 4 requires no separate boot. The manual says CP/M Plus is
compatible with all previous versions of CP/M, but I saw no mention of
how to access files/programs on 2.2 version disks.

Since this is my first look at CP/M Plus, can someone indoctrinate me
on it? Reply direct to JFORREST@SIMTEL20 and not to the entire
list, please.

Thanks in advance

Bridger - You have raised an interesting question.  I have never used
random CP/M files with "holes", but I have read about them.  I think I 
agree with your position on what should be copied.  I wonder, however,
how CP/M treats such a file if you ask the CCP to TYPE it.  What goes to
the screen - just the written sectors, written sectors with intervening
garbage, or what?  And if just the written sectors are displayed, in what
order do you see them?

     I have used a model 4p, running CP/M, about 6 months ago so my memory
may be failing me. I don't remember having the problem you describe. I had
a copy of CP/M plus for the model 4 and the disk booted right up in CP/M
on the 4p without having to go through TRSDOS. Unfortunately I don't have
that machine anymore since it was loaned to me to do some program development
for a client. I do remeber having problems with one of the setup utilities
(cursor type (blinking,not blinking) etc.) but nothing as serious as not
being able to boot up or anything like that. If you could be more specific
as to the problems that occur when it does boot perhaps it may jog my memory
as to what may have also happened to me when using that machine with CP/M
plus.

Thought I'd get my dime in...

  Anybody tried to interface a Quantum 40M 8-incher to a Z-100???  I just
lucked into one for $250, and the manuals show the same signals on the
drive as are supplied on the stock Z-100 hard disk controller and data
separator.  The Quantum is supposed to be SA1000 compatible.

  On putting the Zenith hard-disk upgrade into non-Heath (Zenith) systems,
the problem I'm aware of (like on my home system) is that the controller
card is not powered from the bus, but gets its juice directly from the
power supply.  On the Zenith systems, the power supply doesn't have the
output for the disk controller...on the Heathkit, it does.  Upgrading the 
Zenith requires a new power supply.  I checking now for the brave souls to see
if you could tap your own connections out of the existing supply.

I have heard that the Radio Shack implementation of CP/M Plus is a
real nightmare. It seems that Radio Shack contracted with DRI to write
Plus for the Mod 4, and that we are now seeing the old finger pointing
game - DRI says Radio Shack screwed up on the specs., and Radio Shack
says DRI blew the implementation!
Check out Montezuma Micro's Plus for the Mod 4 - I have heard it works
much better.

(Note the above is heresay garnered from listening into the
conversations of many Model 4 owners on CP-MIG on Compuserve.)

    You are probably slightly out of date with reference to monthly
    charges on Western Union Telex. Their Easy-Link service has no monthly
    charges whatsoever and is much more flexible both in terms of types of
    messages and structure of the system than is MCI Mail. There is no
    application fee and they supply two thick volumes of Telex numbers.

MCI Mail has no application fee, or a montly fee, or even a fee to read
mail. The only charges are for sending mail out.

I suppose the directory would be useful, but they can be bought. Easylink
(and I've done *lots* of work with it) is quite user-hostile as far as
protocol and such. I prefer MCI Mail.

Subject:  Re:  Questions on CP/M Plus

Charlie - Something sounds fishy about that TRS/DRI finger-pointing story.
If Tandy contracted with DRI to write CP/M+ for the Model 4, and didn't
provide DRI with a bunch of Model 4's to try it out on (with a contractual
obligation to do so), it's truly amazing.  But then, Radio Shack has certainly
done some spectacularly stupid things - like trying to make the Model-I a
closed system while Apple was doing just the opposite with their Apple-II.
I doubt whether RS will ever recover from that blunder.

Look in your dBASE manual for information on the "$ substring logical
operator", I think this will help you. A search through the entire
database is nessessary because this is the way a dabase management
system works, it searches through the entire database record by record
till the information is found. If it finds it in record #1, it doesn't
know if record #50 also containes the correct information. If you can,
input the data ranking it in ASCII collating sequence within each
record. INDEXing the database will then put records with the same
keywords together.

Subject: Kaypro-10/Diablo 630 interface troubles
CC: moore.losangel%ibm-sj.csnet@csnet-relay.arpa

I have a PERSISTENT problem using my 630 at 1200 baud (serial) on my
K-10.  The symptom is that when the K-10 sends more than a buffer-full
to the 630, the handshake is fumbled and EVERY TIME a single character
is dropped.  What is particularly strange, is that the same 630 works
fine with my K-2 and K-4, as well as Osborne and even Northstar (on the
same test file)!
 
My local dealer and even Kaypro themselves seem to be at a loss to explain
or fix this problem.  Kaypro seems to believe that I am the only person
who is having this problem.  Am I?  To their credit, they seem to be
really trying to fix the problem -- they replaced the main boards free
in both my K-10s -- unfortunately, the issue remains.
 
Is there anyone out there who has both a Kaypro-10 and a Diablo 630?  Do
they interface properly at 1200 baud and more than one 630-buffer load?
If so, what version ROM (the first number you see when it cold boots) and
CP/M do you have?  If not, what have you tried to fix it and did it work?
 
Note, this problem is NOT related to any particular piece of software; it
is evidenced by "type testfile.630 <ctl-P><CR>".
 
HELP!
 
Thanks for anything ...

substrings, and I can't think of an easy way to do it.

We have a Kaypro II and a Diablo 620; the combination works fine with WordStar,
Perfect Writer, etc., but we experience a somewhat similar problem in printing
Perfect Filer.  Again, the problem seems to be with the handshaking; we overrun
the buffer in the printer, causing strange & variable misprints - usually only
a few characters here and there.  Our dealer has spoken to Kaypro & concluded that the problem 
is in the cable - two connections need to be interchanged to correct the glitch.
It does seem to work if the baud rate is reduced from 1200 to about 120.  I don't
know if our problem is related to yours.

	We have yet to really put Perfect Filer to the test, so I am not sure what
will happen if we try to print a large formatted output.

Subject: Public-Key encryption programs available

The following Public-Key encryption program packages are now available
from SIMTEL20.  The files are in ITS-binary format only because many
of them are stored in binary format inside the .LBRs.  If you need
these programs and cannot FTP ITS-binary files from SIMTEL20, call
RCPM Royal Oak (MI) 313-759-6569.  You'll find them on the D: drive
there as PKS10/M.LBR and RSA11/T.LBR.

Filename			Type	 Bytes	 CRC

Directory MICRO:<CPM.PUBKEY>
PKS10-M.LBR.1			COM	  9728  6C07H
RSA11-T.LBR.1			COM	 69760  DEE4H

Here's a short description of these programs:

PKS Version 1.0

     Public  Key  System routines are derived from  the  article; 
'Public  Key Cryptography:  An Introduction to a powerful crypto-
graphic system for use on microcomputers" by John Smith found  in 
BYTE magazine Volume 8, Number 1, January, 1983.

     The  routines here are MBASIC compatible and differ from the 
published  routines only in handling of the BASIC  function  RND.  
MBASIC  RND  with  an argument of zero  simply  returns  whatever 
number was last generated.   The MBASIC command RANDOMIZE is used 
to seed the random number generator with a number from 0 to 32767 
by  computing;   N  mod  32768.   This  change  appears  in  both 
TESTPRIM.BAS and FINDPRIM.BAS.

RSA Version 1.1 

     The  programs RSASetUp,  RSACrypt,  and RSAClear implement a 
version  of the Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (1) approach to public  key 
cryptography  using TURBO Pascal 2.0 (tm) and intended to run  in 
CP/M  2.2 (tm)  environments.   The following discussion and  the 
subroutines in these programs depend on Knuth (2). Another intro-
duction to this subject is found in Smith (3) with BASIC routines
presented  there  available  in the PKS10/M.LBR library  on  some
bulletin board systems.

     The object files were produced in a configuration such  that 
the   utility  EX or microShell (tm) may be used   to  facilitate 
I/O.

It's pretty nice, especially if you like nroff.  I have made a few
changes/additions to make nro look even more like it.  I will send
it along to INFO-IBMPC, so look there in a little while . . .

A CP/M program called NRO was posted to the net a long time ago.  I
believe it is public domain.  It is an nroff clone, written in C (I
think Aztec, but I don't remember).  Does anyone have the sources of
this?  Does anyone remember who wrote it?  I think it may be due for
reposting.

Subject: Bugs in SD directory program

The following file is forwarded from the RCPM circuit.

To: All Bug Hunters       From: Paul Foote          Date: Sept. 17,1984

I have discovered two subtle bugs in SD-xx.COM where -xx is at least
from -78 to -92 (I suspect they've always been there).  Both bugs
involve the "magic number" *** 255 ***.

BUG ONE

If you have a file EXACTLY 255 records long AND that file is a member
of a .LBR library, SD $L tells you that file is "0k", rather than 32k
in size.  Abel Iwaz found this one in MEX11.LBR in which SD $L told
him MEX.HQP was 0k in size.  After some puzzling around I noticed it
was 255 records in length.  To confirm my guess I created a library
called SDTEST.LBR containing 3 garbage files, one of which was 255
records long.  Bingo !  SD $L said the file (SDTEST.BUG) was 0k.

BUG TWO

When you execute SD on a hard disk containing EXACTLY 255 files, only
the first column of files is displayed -- the other three columns are
blanked out.  Also, as you add or subtract files one at a time 0, 1,
2, or 3 files are blanked out in one row of the display in columns 2
through 4. 

REMARKS

I am not yet too crafty with assembly language, but I know lots of you
out there are.  So I hope I'll see SD-93 or SD-94 on this board soon
-- with these bugs fixed.

Notes on NSWP 204
-----------------

NSWP 204 has a few new features! First, limited CPM 3 has been established,
in that if you have BDOS version over 3.0 (which may include MPM), you may
now run with ALV banked. NSWP will use the BDOS call to obtain the ALV
information. This also applies to the 16 bit version.

Before 204, if you attempted to delete a file that was currently tagged,
it was not removed from the tagged file size. It is correctly handled in all
cases now.

NSWP now saves the SP, rather than (SP), in order to support totally non-
standard implementations of BDOS and CCP.

When using the '?' function, the current disk information, along with the
tagged file size.

The copy file speed has been further optimized by elimination of a redundant
BDOS call (deleting a file, when we know it ain't there!).

NSWP has been modified to better support MPM and MPM86 by doing a rename
after a copy operation. This will drop the copy speed slightly, nullifying
the effect of the above change.

If you find anything else, please drop me a line...

Notes on NSWP 205
-----------------

NSWP 204 introduced a bug that would not allow you to copy a file if
that file was set to R/O, unless you had a destination that was ALSO
R/O!


Notes on NSWP 206
-----------------

NSWP 206 has further CPM 3 features, such as using the display-and-return
error mode. As well, NSWP now fully implements the $$$ copy file techinque,
for both regular and SQ/USQ file copy operations. This will permit the use
of 'PUBLIC' BDOS patches, and full use under MPM, as well as concurrent CPM
86. You may now log directly to a drive/user from the CCP, by using
the syntax NSWP A4:*.*, or more simply NSWP A4 . NSWP now uses the same
routine for CCP logon, as it does for the LOG command within NSWP. If you
have selected a group of files (*.QQZ, for example), this information is
displayed at logon.

07/07/84
NSWP 207
--------

NSWP 207 has the last of the CPM 3 features, and concurrent as well, this
being the multisector IO feature. This speeds file transfers under these
operating systems by at LEAST 1.5 times, and it even handles physical IO
errors whilst doing this. Also, the copy command has been alterted so that
if you copy to a DIFFERENT drive, the disk system is reset. This will permit
fast copies to the same diskette, and the ability to freely change the
destination disk!

John Diamant's suggestion about NRO is misplaced, alas. NRO is not an
nroff clone but a roff clone, and is much less complicated (and useful)
than nroff. It is available on many public-access BBS systems.
