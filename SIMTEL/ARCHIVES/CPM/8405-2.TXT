To: INFO-CPM@AMSAA.ARPA

I need to buy a disk-controller for my boss's son's TRS-80 mod 3. There are
several different ones advertised in 80-MICRO for around $200 (He already
has 2 Shugart SA200 disk drives)..  These advertrisements do not say much
about them, just that they include the controller, power-supply, mounting
hardware, and cables... Has anybody used any, are they any 'gotchas' in using
them, and are they any that I should stay away from...

Any advice at all would be greatly appreciated...

Keith - About a month ago, I installed a pair of DSDD full-size 5.25-inch
Tandons, a disk controller board, an RS-232 board and a separate disk drive
power supply in a friend's TRS-80 Model-III.  We bought all of the electronics
for the disk upgrade from an outfit called Micro Data Supplies in Euclid, Ohio.
They have a package called a "Diskit".  The disk controller board was the
Micro Design MD-7 (or something like that).  We bought the RS-232 board from 
the same outfit in Ohio.  The diskit included the controller board, all cables
(except a ground strap for the drives), two metal mounting plates for the
drives, a drive power supply (switching type by Astec - almost identical to
that used in the Model-III itself), and instructions.  Everything plugged or
screwed in, and it worked right away.  The quality of all items seems very
good, judging by appearance only.  There have been no failures so far.  This
kit supports single or double-side drives, 5.25 or 8-inch, and both internal
and external drives.  The RS-232 board is a separate purchase.  It too looks
good, and worked right away.  So far, the owner of the computer and I are very
pleased with what we bought.  The service on the order was within a week or
two. I don't remember exactly, but it was fast.
