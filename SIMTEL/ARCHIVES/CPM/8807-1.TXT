{
Recursion program discussed earlier in INFO-CPM Digest - implemented
for Turbo Pascal.
 
The program as originally submitted will not work in *any* correctly
implemented Pascal, because it allows only one byte for the variable
"nextchar".   Declaring the variable inside a procedure doesn't mean
that the variable will have a new space created for it on every call
to the procedure; it only means that the variable is not global.
 
Furthermore, it is necessary to make your Pascal's I/O routines take
characters as they are typed, instead of waiting for a <CR>.   Turbo
does this by using a file read from predeclared file "Kbd".  Then it
is necessary to write the character because file reads do not echo.

I am looking for an overlay which will allow MEXplus to be run on a DEC Rainbow

its suitability.

I beg your pardon? Distinct instances of called procedures should have
their own instances of local variables, otherwise recursion is
handicapped.  Any Pascal compiler that doesn't implement this correctly
is brain-damaged. (I know there are some micro compilers out there that
require recursive procedures to be identified as such, so that they can
get away with allocating static storage for local variables instead of
stack storage, because stack manipulation is expensive on itty-bitty
micros.) The relevant reference is J&W 3rd edition, paragraph 10.3.

The reason why the program posted won't work as such is because of line
buffering on most systems.

Well, as you noted, unless you set input mode to binary (or immediate),
the observation that this program requires a line terminator is not surprising.

However, the reason that the msdos and cpm versions only print the last character
is because they did not correctly handle recursion.  The return address and
the variable 'nextchar' both got overwritten on the recursion.

So, it only proves that both pascals dont do windo... I mean recursion.

Sorry about that.
Oh, yes, it prints the word backward fine on a Sun 3/50, but since I did not set
'binary' input mode, I needed a carriage return.

From: mailrus!eecae!upba!unocss!tucker@ames.arc.nasa.gov  (Greg Tucker)
Subject: Otrona Attache repairs needed.

I doubt Jerry Pournelle is out there in "UsenetLand", but perhaps there
is someone else who can help me.  Just recently a friend gave me her
Otrona Attache to fix and return.  When I told her that the problem was
probably the power supply and I couldn't fix it, she told me that I could
keep the machine if I could get it to work.  Ah ha!  This is my problem.

For those of you who are not familiar with the machine, Otrona is a company
that went under several years ago.  However, the Attache, a CPM
transportable with dual disk drives and 5 inch monitor, is a darn nice
little machine.

When I turn on the machine I get nothing.  Zilch.  It is completely dead.
She said her daughter killed it when she went to Europe, and it hasn't
worked since.  The power supply is built to work with varying voltage
standards, however, you have to reverse a card in the back to keep it from
blowing.  This I doubt she did.  I opened up the machine, for all the
good it did me.  The switch is okay, and there is NO power to the fan
(which works fine).  With my limited electronics experience I would say
the power supply is probably the culprit, no?

Now, for the questions...

1. Is anyone aware of a power supply I could buy for it?  Unfortunately,
   Attaches don't use the nice little modular boxed supplies found in
   todays PCs, but rather an open one that runs across two pc boards.
   I assume they did this to make it compatible with other standards.

2. Does anyone know if these machines are still serviced?

3. I am aware that the Attache has an input on the back for a DC power
   supply, namely a battery pack.  However, they don't define the
   configuration for the pins in the manual.  Does anyone know this
   pin configuration?  Would it be possible to use another external
   power supply using this DC input?

4. Am I wasting my time?  I hope not.  All I have is a crummy little
   Apple //e with NO good terminal emulation software, and no good
   Kermit driver.  In addition, the Attache sure would be nice in the
   dorm...

5. Could anyone give me any additional info they might think would be
   helpful?

Thanks in advance...

Subject: Z80 Pascal Compilers and recursion.

Some confusing, misleading, notes have been posted about the simple recursive
example which I quoted only to show that Turbo-Pascal and Polydata Pascal were
behaving in the SAME incorrect way.

1. Pascal IS recursive and the example works perfectly, I repeat, with UNIX
on a VAX, with VAX-VMS, with the IBM and the Waterloo compiler on IBM-VM
systems, with Microsoft Pascal under MS-DOS, and with JRT Pascal on my Z80
system. It does NOT work correctly with Turbo-Pascal and Polydata Pascal under
MS-DOS but this has nothing to do with the language implementation, only with
its I/O interface when the unit is the keyboard.

2. Turbo Pascal and Polydata Pascal DO correctly implement recursion, with the
DEFAULT {A-} compiler option . The alternate option {A+}, under CP/M-80 ONLY,
contrarily to what Erik Seielstad writes, makes the code NOT recursive. Again,
the DEFAULT obeys Pascal RULES, while EXPLICITLY requesting {A+} ( A for
ABSOLUTE code) will assume you don't want recursion and thus save speed and
memory (so says the guide, at least...)

3. Then I will repeat my request: WHO CAN GIVE ME AN ADDRESS WHERE TO BUY
PREFERABLY Z80_Polydata_Pascal ,OR STILL ACCEPTABLE Z80_Turbo_Pascal?

I received no reply on this before and i still need help.  I have a friend

ports, e.g. LST:, PRN:, PUN:, AUX: in every case the system hangs, as 
though waiting for a DTR.  The printer self tests OK and both units are set
to run at 1200 baud, 8 bits, no parity.  I don't even get garbage.  The NEC
has a DB25 connector; that with the baud and parity switches makes me believe it
uses a serial interface.  Is there something else i need to know to get
the Kaypro to dump a character stream?  It also has a parallel port, but 
the software didn't have any procedures to reassign any logical devices.

From: ted@sbcs.sunysb.edu  (Dr. Ted Carnevale)
Subject: Pascal, recursion, and buffered input

There seems to be some confusion about these topics and the capabilities of
at least one Pascal compiler for "itty bitty micros," as some wag put it.
The difficulties arose about a program like this, which ought to
accept keyboard input until a space is encountered,
and then echo the entire input string backwards.
============

PROGRAM tryit(input,output);

PROCEDURE readwrite;
VAR nextchar:char;
BEGIN
  read(nextchar); if nextchar <> ' ' then readwrite; write(nextchar);
END;

BEGIN
  writeln('Type in a word that ends with a space');
  readwrite
END.

============
There are two reasons this program doesn't work properly with Turbo Pascal:
Turbo buffers keyboard input, and recursion is NOT enabled as a default.

It really isn't necessary to resort to arrays for temporary storage of 
keyboard input.  Simply enabling recursion with the {$A-} option and 
turning off input buffering takes care of most of the problem:
============

PROGRAM tryitr(input,output);
(* With Turbo Pascal this program works like so:

print message
REPEAT
  accept keyboard input until CR is encountered
UNTIL input stream contains a blank
starting with the blank and working backward, print out the input stream

Thus this input stream:
onetwothree four five<CR>
produces this output:
 eerhtowteno

and this input stream:
one<CR>
two<CR>
three four five<CR>
produces this output:
 eerht
owt
eno
*)

(* enable recursion *)
{$A-}
(* use standard Pascal I/O rather than buffered keyboard input *)
{$B-}

PROCEDURE readwrite;
VAR nextchar:char;
BEGIN
  read(nextchar); if nextchar <> ' ' then readwrite; write(nextchar);
END;

BEGIN
  writeln('Type in a word that ends with a space');
  readwrite
END.

============
Still, the program doesn't quite work properly.  It should produce its 
output as soon as a blank occurs in the input stream, instead of waiting
for a carriage return to tell it to process an input line.  Reading from
the "keyboard" input device instead of standard input takes care of this
last problem.  Note that the {$B-} switch is no longer needed--"keyboard"
input is not buffered.
============

PROGRAM trykbd(input,output);
(* With Turbo Pascal this program works like so:
print message
REPEAT
  accept input stream
UNTIL blank is encountered
starting with the blank and working backward, print out the input stream

Thus this input stream:
onetwothreeB
produces this output:
Beerhtowteno
where B is a blank
*)

(* enable recursion *)
{$A-}

PROCEDURE readwrite;
VAR nextchar:char;
BEGIN
  read(Kbd,nextchar); write(nextchar);
  if nextchar <> ' ' then readwrite; write(nextchar);
END;

BEGIN
  writeln('Type in a word that ends with a space');
  readwrite
END.

============

    I am forced to disagree.  The definition of Pascal sets up a
stack frame at runtime for each invocation of a subroutine.  This is
the reason ANY recursion is possible in pascal.  The program TRYIT
was a simple example of recursion, and *should* work on all pascal
compilers.  I tried it here on our mainframe, and it worked fine as
written.
    The reasson it does not work on Turbo Pascal, is Borland
allocates static storage for all variables at compile time, unless
the special compiler directive {A+} is used.

In Turbo V3.0, {$A+} is the default - not {$A-} as Jacques Goldberg
says.  This was done to provide the fastest possible compilation and
execution in the general case.  Be that as it may...

Jacques, you can buy Z80 Turbo in any one of zillions of disk formats
directly from Borland:

	Borland International
	4585 Scotts Valley Drive
	Scotts Valley, CA  95066
	USA

Specify CP/M-80 and your disk format.  The price for V3.0 is $69.95. 
Do not buy V4.0, which is for MS-DOS only, specifically PCs and PC
clones.

There should be a program on your system disk called "CONFIG.COM".  This
program permits you to change many of system's parameters, including the
assignment of the LST: device, baud rates, numeric keypad and cursor key
character generation, etc.  You may also reassign logical devices with
"STAT.COM" (also on your system disk).  It is documented in your CP/M
manual.  For example:

A0>stat dev:

will produce a listing of the logical device assignments.

The actual pin assignments on your Kaypro should be in your Owner's Manual.
Interfacing the Kaypro to a serial printer is discussed at some length in
"The RS-232 Solution", available from Sybex Computer Books.  Kaypro
apparently did some strange things to the RS-232 interface (but then who
hasn't!).

Subject: Looking for GOOD Fortran manual

I have a copy of Microsoft Fortran 77 for a C/PM operating system that I'd 
really like to get running in the next month and a half.

There's just one little problem...the Microsoft Fortran manual is ka-ka.

Does anyone have any suggestions for a more readable/understandable Fortran
manual that can be used with this version of Microsoft and that will help
me to do my programming?  Alternatively, I am also accepting suggestions
for other C/PM Fortran packages that have good documentation and user
interface.

Thanks muchly!

(Apologies in advance if this is the wrong place to send this to; not
surprisingly, I couldn't find a mailing list devoted just to S-100 stuff).

Yesterday I received a Solid State Music PB-1 prom burner S-100 board.
Naturally, it came without manuals or schematics, and the person doubts
that it works.

Does anybody know if (a) SSM is still around, and if so, what their
address/phone number is, and (b) if not, does anybody have a PB-1 manual
or schematic that I could photocopy?

Please reply directly to me, as I'm not on info-micro.  Thanks.

Subject: CBIOS & format for Xerox 820-1 w/double dens mod

	Greetings!

	I have a Xerox 820-1 I'm trying to upgrade to double
density, using the WD 2793 controller (yes, and the Emerald Microware
upgrade kit). It runs CP/M 2.2, and does it very nicely. It occurs 
to me that I will need a format program to handle
double density. I could write one, but if someone else has invented this
particular wheel, why should I? :-)

	In addition, the CBIOS will also need to know how to select the
proper density, keep track of who's double and who's single at any given
moment, etc. (this particular system will have 2 to 4  5 1/4" DSDD drives
on it, and I need to do a LOT of single -> double copying)
I suspect someone's already addressed this task, and again I don't see
the need to dig into the beast if it's already been done, so....

	Any comments?

There are a couple of ROMs sold for the 820-I which have a number of
utilities associated with them.  One is the Xpro MicroCornucopia ROM and the
other is the MicroCode Plus2 ROM.  The Xpro is super-cheap since it has few
features in it.  Plus2 is about $40(?) but has about 11 formats built-in, a
way to define user-definable formats, and can read/write MS-DOS disks through
Bridger Mitchell's DosDisk program.  There are a bunch of other features
Plus2 has that Xpro does not; Xpro only comes with ROM, BIOS, FORMAT, and
SYSGEN.

I will have to warn you that I am a tad biased, though, since I wrote the ROM
and all utilities for it.

I'm no Kaypro Guru, but reading between the lines from above I interpret it
to mean that your friend's Kaypro has a serial port for a modem and a parallel
port for a centronix style printer. The problem with the "DB25" RS232
connectors is that there are two ways of wiring them: DTE (Data terminal
equipment) and DCE (Data carrier equipment). DCE refers to modems, which
transmit data on pin 3, DSR (Data Set Ready) on pin 6, DCD (Data carrier
detect) on pin 8 and CTS (Clear to send) on pin 5. DTE refers to just about
everything else: terminals, the PUN: RDR: port on the back of a Kaypro, and
printers: these devices transmit data on pin 2, DTR (Data terminal ready)
on pin 20, and RTS (Request to send) on pin 4. Now if you've been following
all the above, you will have noticed that BOTH the printer AND the Kaypro
are transmitting on the same pins (2,4,20) and listening to the same
pins (3,5,6,8). What you need to do is to make up a crossover cable
(sometimes called a null modem) which does the following: on both ends
pin 2 at one end goes to pin 3 at the other end, pin 20 at one end
goes to pins 6 and 8 at the other, and pin 4 at one end goes to pin
5 at the same end:

	2------------\/-----------2
	3------------/\-----------3
	4---+                 +---4
	5---+                 +---5
	6-----+           +-------6
	8-----+-----\/----+-------8
	20----------/\-----------20

with pin 7 (ground) wired straight through. What this does is to trick
each end into thinking the other end is a modem, and everyone is happy.
I can't guarantee that this is the solution, but if you've been using
the same cable to talk to the printer as you talk to a modem with then
I'll take even's money bets that's why it wasn't working.

    I have recently obtained an IMSAI computer for fun, and I am having

I have aligned one of them, but I still can't get it to boot.  I received
about 40 disks with the system, but I think they may all be bad since they
haven't been used for around eight years.  Everything else seems to be ok
(computer accesses drive 0), so I have concluded that the disks have to 
be bad.  Does anyone out there in net-land still have an S100 computer

I would be willing to buy a copy of Northstar CPM if anyone still has

I agree with Dave Goodenough's solution, that most likely a null modem
is needed with the cable that is currently being used.  I found that one
can often get by with just a 4-wire cable, with 1-1, 2-3, 3-2, and 7-7 in
the cable, and pins 8-20 wired independently at each end.  Seems to keep
the devices happy.  By the way, this is a standard cable assembly available
from INMAC among other places.

Help!!!
	I have a z80 cpm box at work that has problems, and I'm looking
	for ideas to improve it a little.  If it were up to me, I'd
	replace it with a Pc, but for several reasons, we need to continue
	to use it.

	The version of cpm that it is running seems to be < 2.2, and 
	the bdos seem to be brain-damaged.
	(1) There is no escape code to position the cursor, however 
		calling the bios CONOUT routine to print a 0x18 with the 
		row/col in HL does the job.  (don't even ask how I found
		this out!)
	(2) Bdos function 6 (direct console i/o) does not exist, but 
		the corresponding bios calls work ok.  Other bdos calls 
		may be ok, but I trust the bios much more.  The bdos also
		refuses to return the version#.
	
	The computer itself is a Videoplan form Kontron Electronics 
	(in Munich & California), has 1 Z80-sio, 1 ctc, 2 pio's (keyboard 
	& printer) and a WD1771-B01 floppy controller (single density). 
	The motherboard is a (4mhz?) KDT rev. IV.  If anyone from Kontron 
	is reading this, and has any docs on this board, please send me 
	e-mail.

	Even its disks are strange - single density, 35 tracks x 2 sides, 
	and 16 sectors/track yielding about 138K per disk.

	I've been thinking about getting Z-cpr to replace the bdos/ccp,
	but I'm not sure if it would even install in such a brain damaged
	system.  I have no hardware or software docs on this machine, but
	I have found all of the port#s for the sio/ctc/pio's, and can
	probably find the floppy controller and video (Motorola 6845L) if
	needed.  

	Anyone got any other ideas?  I'd love to be able to do double-density,
	but I don't know if the WD1771 can do this.  I have heard that 
	Z-Cpr 3.4 is self-installing, but it may have problems here...
	I have managed to get kermit running, but I'd like to get turbo
	pascal or a c-compiler working.  Respond via e-mail, or post it
	if you think others would be interested.

Joe,

the Morrow Micro-Decision computers are pretty fine machines.
We bought one for my Dad several years ago and he still uses it
regularly.  Dad's desires are pretty modest; he's quite
happy with WordStar and I've made up a couple utilities
for him.  TurboPascal works just fine for the dinking around.
I keep a few things like spreadsheets in Dad's portfolio so I
can do some work while visiting and out of reach of my CPM
machines.

The MD2s and kin are pretty much middle of the road CPM so they
don't quibble much about any middle of the road CPM software.

Unfortunately, support is a bit hard to find.  George Morrow himself
is alive and well, but the company didn't make it (they were having
too much fun).

     What you are describing sounds very much like CP/M 1.4.  It implemented
neither the BDOS 6 call, nor the BDOS 12 call ( well, it *did* do BDOS 12,
but it used it for something else ).

     As for trusting the BIOS, watch out.  There are differences between the
2.2 BIOS and a 1.4 BIOS.

     I can almost guarantee that you won't be able to install the Z-System
on this machine.  You need a 2.2 system for that.  NZCOM will probably
blow up if you try to use it.  Save your money.

     I know that the 1770 can, but it needs external help.  How do I know
this?  This computer right here ( Ampro LB/Z80 ) uses the 1770.  Pick
up the data sheets on the chip from Western Digital.  They've always been
most helpful when I've spoken to them.

     Good luck!

Subject: C for CP/M

Hello,

    I would like to have C for my Apple CP/M system ... could anyone out 
there tell me if there is Turbo C for such a configuration.  If not Turbo C,
then is BSD C still available, and if it is, how could I get it?  I guess
BSD C would be ok since simtel20 has several directories of stuff for it.
Any information about C for CP/M would be welcome, and can be sent to
the addresses following this message.

            Thanks,
                Rodney Ferryman

Subject: Need ascii encoded keyboard

I am in need of a cheap ascii encoded keyboard for my cp/m box.
The original one has an 8-bit ascii parallel interface with strobe
line.  If anyone has a used one they would like to sell, or know of
where I can get one (in a case), please reply via e-mail.

Subject: ZCPR3.4 for Apple CP/M.

I've read about the new auto-installing ZCPR system, some weeks ago in
this very INFO-CPM bulletin. But If I remember it well they concluded
that auto-installing would NOT work for Aplle CP/M. So, will first of
all ZCPR3.4 be supported for Apple (probably yes) and when will the
patching program be available (something like the file in the following
subdirectory <cpm.apple>ap60zcpr.lbr )?

I cann't remember whether NZCOM or ZCPR3.4 wasn't PD?

Thanks in advance )(bye)(

Subject: Apple and CPM / AE Z80plus

I have a Laser128 with an AE Z80plus card in it running CP/AM 5.1.
I just purchased Borland's Turbo Pascal V3.0 which seems to run just fine.
The problem is that is all I have for the card, I would like to find a 
communications program that works with it as this would allow me to get
more software.
I called one public domain company and they sent me one that is communicating
with something other than my modem and therefore is just generating garbage.
Also, is there a way to read disks formatted for other CP/M formats?

Any help would be appreciated.

Request for a C Compiler:
------------------------

I am EXCEEDINGLY happy with the very cheap MIX-C compiler.

I use it on the Z80/CP/M Lobo Max-80 to develop software at home, which has
always been ported without a flaw to my MS-DOS machine, and to our IBM=VM
(Waterloo C compiler), VAX-VMS and Unix machines.

The book only that comes with it would cost more than the package, if you would
go to a store to purchase similar material.

I may have been happy, but I never had any problem in 2 years.

MIX-Software used to carry many formats, and their phone is
1-800-333-0330

From: MA18%SYSE.SALFORD.AC.UK@CUNYVM.CUNY.EDU
Subject: NZCOM and Echelon IOPs - A Problem.

Subject: Problems with Echelon supplied IOPs and NZCOM.
I have experienced a problem with all three of the IOPs that Echelon used to
supply (Nukey, Bprinter, and recorder) when trying to use them with my system
running NZCOM, when everything was OK under ZCOM. I have identified the
problem with NUKEY, but have not had the time nor the inclination to check the
other two. I suspect the problem is generic. The cause f thof the problem is th
the coding of Nukey assumes that ENV address is a multiple of 256. So when it
tries to find the address of the IOP from the ENVironment it *REPLACES* the
lower byte of the address (in L) rather than adding it in. With NZCOM on my
new system the ENV address has a lower byte of 80H (it is E280H). It used to
be a multiple of 256. I am not sure whose "fault" this problem is but it may
not matter too much as there is a simple solution.

I could have simply altered the existing code to set the top bit when the
lower byte of the address was replaced. This is simple. It will work BUT it
may recur with some other memory configuration of NZCOM. My preferred solution
is to use an ARUNZ alias to do the following:
load nukey into memory
set a register to the value loc 109 (using an alias - to ensure memory is loaded
test the register using IF (type 3 or 4)  and conditionally patch the
    offending constant
finally we simply GO!

I intended to include the source of the two aliases - but I left them at home
on my Z machine. This is coming to you from a PC (no comment). If this idea
is not enough I can post the sources later in the week.

I hope this is of some help.

BTW NZCOM is a really nice system. I can now use ProPascal and Turbo M2
without needing to go to CPM, and I can very easily re-load my RCP and IOP
after using BGii.

The 7710 uses hardware handshaking, if I remember correctly.  I'll be at
a site next week that drives a NEC with a Kaypro and will try to get the cable
info; it was written up in one of those books on intrfacing serial devices
available at larger Daltons, etc.

Subject: Printer mystery...

I bought a used printer last weekend to use with my Kaypro 1.  It's a Radio
Shack LP VIII.  (Don't laugh -- it was cheap and apparently in great shape.)
Plugged into the parallel port on the Kaypro, it prints nearly every character
twice in ssuucceessiioonn -- not a pretty sight!  Except....when using the
K-1 screen dump program (from simtel20), it prints perfectly.  Printing
from WordStar, PIP and anything else I've tried results in doubled characters.

I connected the printer to a friend's PC-clone, and it prints perfectly there.
Suspecting a problem with my centronics port, I connected the same friend's
Okidata 182 to the Kaypro.  Perfect results again.  So, all the *pieces* work
independently, but the combination of the Kaypro and the LP VIII fails --
except using the screen dump program. 

Has anyone seen this sort of problem?  Is there any cure, or are these devices
just flat incompatible??

I'd sure appreciate any help....

Subject: Hard disk question - Intertec CP/M

I have an Intertec VPU-30 linked with an Intertec DSS-10 10 Meg hard disk that 
was working completely for years.  Recently, i took the DSS-10 to an Intertec 
Maintance shop to try to pick up a "new" (read liquidating) unit to talk to the
unit.  We got the unit to be able to read files on the DSS-10 but not copy
between floppy and hard drive.  (This is not the problem, but background info).

Now I have the hard drive back on my own systems here, and find I cannot copy 
anything to the hard disk.  I can access all files on the hard drive, but if
I try to create a new one with WordStar(tm), or PIP, it locks up the system.

Any ideas what has happened out there in CP/M land?

Contact me at pvpullen@crdec-vax2.arpa with e-mail or at (301) 671 3544 by 
land line.

I can save you a some time, I think.  The Spinwriter 7700 family
hardware handshakes on pin 19 (Secondary Request To Send).  To set up
a cable, you should connect pins 5 and 6 on the computer side to pin
19 on the printer side.  A diagram for it looks like this:

Computer	Printer
-----------------------
TD  2	<----->	2  TD	(straight through)
RD  3	<----->	3  RD
SG  7	<----->	7  SG
CTS 5	<--,
DSR 6	<--|-->	19 SRTS

Sorry for not noticing this the first time :-).  By the way, I found
this out the hard way (I'm not really a hardware hacker), even though
I had the Spinwriter manual right in front of me.  What a drag!

	"The 7710 uses hardware handshaking, if I remember correctly."

The 7710 will do just about anything ... it will do hardware handshake,
XON/XOFF, or ETX/ACK.  This is all selected by dip switches.  But the
pinouts are nonstandard, so if you want hardware handshake you'll have
to make a special cable.

I've had a 7710 for six years, hooked to my TRS-80 model II running P&T
CP/M.  (I never dreamed this system would keep working for so long!)  I
use hardware handshake at 1200 baud.

Subject: SIMTEL20->CMS->DOS Success

I recently requested help transferring files from SIMTEL20 to my micro via
an IBM mainframe.  After reading several replies (thanks :-) and
experimenting a bit, I have succeeded.  The trick is to issue the FTP
command TYPE I followed by TYPE 8 before transferring a file (actually,
TYPE 8, TYPE 32, and QUOTE TYPE seem to have the same effect).

A few details: I am using MS-Kermit 2.30 and a modem to connect my micro
to an IBM 4381 via a Series/1 protocol converter.  The 4381 is running
CMS.  I use FTP on the 4381 to connect to SIMTEL20.  The following
"recipe" successfully transferred the file from FTP to my micro:

1)  start up FTP on the 4381 and connect to SIMTEL20
2)  issue the FTP command TYPE I
3)  issue the FTP command TYPE L 8
    (or TYPE L 32 or QUOTE TYPE L 8)
4)  use the FTP command CWD to get to the right SIMTEL20 directory
5)  use the FTP command GET to transfer the file to the 4381
6)  use the FTP command QUIT to log off SIMTEL20 and shut down FTP
7)  start up CMS-Kermit on the 4381
8)  issue the CMS-Kermit command SET FILE-TYPE BINARY (MS-Kermit doesn't
need to be "told" that the file type is binary, but other communications
packages, such as ProComm, do need to be "told")
9)  use the two Kermits to transfer the file from the 4381 to my micro
10) "unarc" the file if it is an ARC file (I use ARCE30F).

The FTP commands TYPE L 8, TYPE L 32, and QUOTE TYPE L 32 seemed to have
identical effects.  The copies of the file were the same length according
to both CMS and DOS, and ARCE30F was able to "unarc" all three.

The FTP command TYPE L 8 was inadequate unless preceded by TYPE I The FTP
command TYPE I was inadequate unless followed by TYPE L 8, TYPE L 32, or
QUOTE TYPE L 8.  The version of FTP I use does not recognize the TENEX
command.

I've said this before (and got roundly roasted for it), BUT be
careful of MediaMaster!!  They advertise that it works for lots
of CP/M formats, when in fact, of the five that I tried, only
1 (Kaypro) worked.  This was the PC version.  That was bad enough,
but the people at Intersecting Concepts were NO help at all with
pleas for help.
You might try to use a copy of the program on your particular
CP/M format BEFORE you throw your $$'s at them.

(The above is MY opinion, derived from personal experience.  I
don't want to hear about ALL the formats that MM works with.  It
didn't work with the ones that I needed it for, and I felt/feel
ripped off.  Your mileage may vary!)

I'm looking for a piece of software (which I think I remember

MSDOS machines hooked in on a serial port.  I was thinking
that this server code on the AT would run in the background
so that a user could be on the console while the remotes were
transfering files in the background.  I don't need full OS
capability across the network, just simple file transfers and
maybe a way to change directories and get a directory listing.
A KERMIT server that ran in the background would be ideal!
Has anyone seen / come across anything like this?  I'd
appreciate any info.   Posting OK, Direct E-Mail BEST.  TNX

This may be part of your problem: function 12 (0xc) in V2.0 and higher
gives back the version number - V1.X does not: it appears that you have
a very early version. To verify this try some tests of the random access
routines: if they fail you almost certainly have a pre 2.0 bdos.

Sadly the 1771 only talks single density, and I don't know if the 1791 /
1793 would be a dropin replacement.

     Is there anyone else out there looking for a mainframe archiver? I
am referring to the archiver programs which take files on a floppy
disk, crunch, squeeze, pack, store, etc., them into a single file
called an archive, which is a very popular space saving mechanism in
the microcomputer world. There was a request for one in Florida and
now there is a request for one here in Alaska, two states which are
about as far apart as one can get and still be in the same country,
etc., and all that jazz. Please! Help! We need a mainframe archiver!

Oops, sorry folks, I didn't mention what KIND of mainframe. We are
operating a VAX/VMS v4.6 . . .gf

Kids these days.....   It's not a mainframe if it has wheels.

I would like to get CPM for the Commodore 64 and I understand Commodore
does not market it anymore.  Does anyone know how I could get it?

Subject: help with zcom and zcpr1

....zzzzz

perhaps someone can help shed some light on a problem i'm having.  i 
run pickles and trout cp/m 2.2mh on a radio shack model ii/16 with a 
15 meg hard drive.

for some time i've been successfully running zcom on the system, but 
this eats up quite a bit of my tpa and so i have memory problems with 
programs that are tpa hungry... compilers, ark02, ...

i located a copy of zcpr1, assembled it for cb00h, where my stock ccp 
loads, inserted it in the appropriate p&t hard drive file 
(bioscp/m.pnt), fixed the relocation bitmap for it and ran it.  no 
problems so far.

i figured i'd use zcpr1 when i had to do memory hungry stuff, and load 
zcom when not.  with the zcpr1 loaded, i typed in the command to bring 
up zcom (with zrdos and zcpr33 installed) as normal.  the first 
indication i got that things weren't loading well was when hsh errored 
and told me it needed zcpr33 to run.  things whirred and clicked a 
moment longer and then settled out to the prompt ">".  not much 
functionality was left at this time...  although zcx worked.

so... the question is, since the zcpr1 ccp fit exactly where the stock 
ccp resided, why didn't zcom sign on correctly?  i even tried doing 
the zcld again...  but things didn't change.

i figure i'm missing something obvious....   if you have any ideas, 
please let me know.   thanks...

True, but still usable as is.  In CP/M 1.3 and 1.4, it was not *intended* to
return the version number, but rather some obscure disk function like "unload
heads" or something like that.  The function *is* supposed to return A=00,
which lets you know it is earlier than CP/M 2.x or MP/M.

David is correct about the single-density 1771; also, the 1791/1793 is NOT a
drop in replacement.  You need a bit of external clock/data separation
circuitry to run double density as well as a higher clock rate to the chip
itself (2 MHz instead of 1 MHz).  Potentially some major board work here...

I missed out on the earlier conversation, so don't know what system you have
and if there is some adapter kit sold for your machine.
