Subject: PREBAS - a Basic pre-processor now available

PREBAS is available from SIMTEL20 as:

Filename			Type	 Bytes	 CRC

Directory MICRO:<CPM.BASIC>
PREBAS.LBR.1			BINARY	 67456  5EE9H

Here is a brief excerpt from the author's .DOC file:

PREBAS is a pre-processor for BASIC.  It takes a flat ASCII file, adds
line numbers to it, and, optionally, resolves references to target
labels.  It can also resolve the labels without line numbers, or strip
old line numbers out of a file.  PREBAS is intended as an aid to BASIC
programmers.  With it they can enter a program in their favorite text
editor or word processor, while not worrying about line numbers, or
the targets for their GOTO and GOSUB statements.  It has a number of
options, including:

     adding line numbers
     resolving labels
     stripping old line numbers  
     selection of the start number 
     selection of the step size selection of the label marker 
     addition of comments to the end of a line,  
     showing target labels  
     command line execution (not yet available in MS/DOS version)

PREBAS was written in Microsoft BASIC (MBASIC) and was compiled with
BASCOM. There are three files:

     PREBAS.DOC -- This document.
     PREBAS.COM -- The compiled executable program (linked to 
                   OBSLIB.REL).
     PREBAS.BAS -- The BASIC source code.

Note: I include the BASIC source so that the defaults can be changed
(see Appendix A -- Customization) or so that PREBAS can be recompiled
to run under the BRUN run-time library. PREBAS does run under the
interpreter, but runs very slowly (especially if you are resolving
labels).  PREBAS translates line-by-line (writing each line out to the
new file), rather than in RAM.  I felt that speed was less important
than a limitation of size imposed by the size of RAM.  However, PREBAS
is still limited by disk capacity, needing room for a file at least
the same size as the input file.

Subject: FBAD60 non-destructive disk test program

FBAD60 is now available from SIMTEL20 as:

Filename			Type	 Bytes	 CRC

Directory MICRO:<CPM.DSKUTL>
FBAD60.LBR.1			BINARY	 30208  0393H

FBAD is a NON-DESTRUCTIVE disk test program for CP/M-80.  It will find
all bad blocks on a disk and build a file [UNUSED].BAD to allocate
them, thus "locking out" the bad blocks so CP/M will not use them.
This allows continued use of the disk as though it had no bad areas.

If an [UNUSED].BAD file is found on the disk before the test you will
be prompted to keep the existing file (and all currently flagged bad
blocks) or erase it and only flag the bad blocks found on the current
pass.

Good news for CP/M+ users!  You can use FBAD60.  Dave Mabry says: I
have included a file in the LBR called BIOS2RSX.RSX which is an RSX
for CP/M Plus that will allow FBAD to work on CP/M Plus operating
systems.  In order to use FBAD on CP/M Plus you must attach the RSX to
FBAD.COM as follows:

GENCOM FBAD60 BIOS2RSX

Then the resultant FBAD60.COM will then run properly on CP/M Plus
but will not run on CP/M V2.2 or earlier without removing the RSX.

Here is what's new in recent updates to FBAD:

; 03/28/85 Cleaned up some code that sends messages.
;   v60    Modified STOP routine so that you really can abort the
;	   program with ^C.		- Dave Mabry
;
; 03/16/85 Program will ask you if you want to continue checking on the
;   v59    same drive as originally entered - added a byte at the end of
;	   the code (ORIGDR) to store the value from the FCB.
;					     ( Ken Kaplan )
;
; 12/12/84  Added the ability to keep bad blocks that were flagged in a
;   v58     previous [UNUSED].BAD file.  If a block was ever flagged as
;	    bad by this program, it is probably weak.  If on a subse-
;	    quent test, it makes it through the BIOS retires and is read
;	    successfully, I want the block to stay in the [UNUSED].BAD
;	    file.  Removed the coded in LTOP which cleared the high byte
;	    of HL after a call to RECTRN.  My BIOS (Morrow DJDMA) sets
;	    the high bit of HL to indicated side 1 of a double-sided
;	    drive.			- Ron Schwabel (Ron Schwabel)
;
; 11/29/84  Integrated Mike Webbs idea to display Track-Nr. Changed DOC
;   v57     up front accordingly.	- BGE
;

;   v56     the 06/07/84 version.  Reformatted.
;					- Irv Hoff

I have had a Hayes 2400 modem for a week, now.  It came with a note
saying that it wouldn't work on some earlier PBX's, and if I had one,
to return the modem and a new one would be sent out in 2 weeks.

It is much more vulnerable to shot noise (appears as random left-hand

I received my new Heathkit catalog yesterday and was surprised to see

$99.00 (was $250.00) and MPM-86 for $99.00 (was $649.00!!).

Not being familiar with the capabilities, limitations and availability
of applications software for these products, I wondered if these were
"dead" operating systems.  I use mainly CP/M-85 and MS-DOS.

Can someone convince me that:
   A.  These prices are the bargain of the century!!
                       or
   B.  They aren't worth the shipping cost.

Subject: Uniform and Media Master
To: info-cpm@AMSAA.ARPA


I agree with those folks who recommend Uniform and Media Master as good file
transfer programs.  I have used them both on Morrow, Rainbow, and Osborne-1
(CP/M on all three) and have rarely had any difficulties.  

There is one important difference between these two products that might help
someone out there choose between them.

Media Master - MM is all menu driven.  You do your work from within MM.  For
example, I can tell my rainbow that drive A: is Kaypro II, B: is IBM 1.0ss,
and C: is IBM 2.0ss, and then use menu commands to list directories, move
files from one disk to another, erase files, etc.  I can even format new disks.

Uniform - On the Morrow MD3, I can only reassign drive B:.  For MSDOS<->CPM
transfers, it uses menues like MM, except that I cannot go from one alien format
to another.  I always have to go thru Morrow format.

Uniform - On the other hand, if Uniforms is used to tell the Morrowthat
drive B: is a CPM format, say Osborne or Kaypro, then the user can exit back to
CPM, but the alien disk format sticks.  You can edit files on B:alien.dsk,
run .com files, use sweep to move stuff around, etc.  (I guess Uniform patches
the OS.)

In short, if you move files from one alien format to another, MM is the choice.
If you usually use files from one alien format on your base machine, then
I think Uniform is more appropriate.

By the way, Media Master on many CP/M machines is only about $30.

Unfortunately, you cannot read or write Apple disks on a CP/M system
like the Kaypro. The reason for this is that Apple uses a HARD SECTORED
"maverick" format unlike every other system out there which uses SOFT
sectoring (which is what makes programs like MediaMaster and Uniform
possible).

However, there is a way to get those text files over to the Kaypro, and
it actually makes more sense in your situation.
What you need is a modem and communications software on both machines:
then file transfer will be as easy as a phone call (well, almost)

If you don't already have the software, the public domain program MODEM7
is available for both the Kaypro and the Apple (you can get them through
your local user groups)

wrongo - the apple use soft-sectoring (not hard sectoring)

the only hard sector machines left are very old Heaths and NorthStars
(I've got a NorthStar and an apple both)

In truth, the apple is 'softer' sectoring than anybody else - it
doesn't look at the sector hole(s) *AT ALL*.  Therefore one can use
in the apple either soft or hard sectored disks providing that you
format them first.  It is this 'softer' sectoring that makes the
apple weird - all other normal machine do look at the index hole -
a hard sectored disk drives them wild.

The end result is the same in anycase--> use a commo program.

CP/M-86 is very much a 'live' system (although nowhere near as
popular in the USA as MS-DOS).  MP/M-86 has pretty much been
replaced by Concurrent CP/M-86 and Concurrent PC-DOS.

But that price on CP/M-86 is *WAY* out of line.  Mail order prices
have been as low as $33.

NetLandians,

A separate message described a bug in TurboPascal V2.0 for CP/M-80.  If
you are running TurboPascal in a User Area other than 0, when you exit
TurboPascal it will force you into User Area 0 whether you like it or not.

The fix described several bytes in TurboPascal to patch, but was specific
to Version 2.0 only.

Here's the fix for TurboPascal Version 1.0 for CP/M-80:

Using DDT, DSD, EDFILE, or whatever, list 2741H...

Original code:

2741  LDA 3E24		;where TurboPascal earlier stored the
			;current disk/user.
      DCR A		;always
      STA 0004		;where CP/M keeps the current disk/user
      JMP 0000		;return to CP/M

I couldn't find exactly WHERE TurboPascal messes up that stored
disk/user value, but it sure 'nuff gets blown away somewhere.

So... just eliminate that retrieval altogether.  It appears that
the original CP/M stored value at 0004 does NOT get changed (I tried
various disk reads and writes, and it remained the same disk and user
area as when I started).

2741  JMP 0000		;just return to CP/M, skipping the rest.

Now, when you exit TurboPascal, you'll still be in your original

Subject: APPLE ][ to KAYPRO on a null modem
To: stork@MIT-MC.ARPA
CC: info-cpm@AMSAA.ARPA


I have transferred files from an APPLE ][ to a KAYPRO using MEX
on the KAYPRO and ZPRO on the APPLE ][ over a null modem at
speeds of up to 9600 baud. It worked beautifully.
I initially did it using modems at 300 baud and a phone, but found that the
phone line is unnecessary if you have a seriel card in 
the APPLE ][, you can easily use a null modem cable.
A null modem cable can easily be built. It is simply a
pair of db-25 connectors (Males usually) that have the following
pin connections: Pin 1 to pin 1, pin 2 to pin 3 at the other end,
pin 3 to pin 2 at the other end, pin 7 to pin 7, pin 6 to
pin 20 at the other end and pin 20 to pin 6 at the other end. The idea is to swap the send
and receive lines and the dtr and cts lines.
If you have an APPLE ][ super serial card, then you don't need
to build anything. You can set the configuration block to the
TERMINAL mode and use your existing db-25 cable. Read the book
and you'll see that this configuration is the
same as having a null modem cable.

It should be possible to write the RWTS (read-write-track-sector)
code that resides at BD00-BFFF in an APPLE ][ in 8080 code
and make it run in a KAYPRO. The hard part would be to
get the documentation which describes how you access the
disk directly from 8080 code in the KAYPRO. You
would need to know how to turn on the motor, how to
check for write protect, how long to wait after turning
on the motor before reading, what the data really looks
like when you do a read (bit-by-bit read) and how
you define which disk drive you want to access. I
do not know if this information is available for the KAYPRO.
It is also possible to use MEX, MODEM7, or any other
xmodem-capable program to do quick APPLE ][ to KAYPRO
transfers. I like using MEX because it has wild card
capability. 

If the files you need to transfer
are ascii, rather than binary, it is
possible to use PIP on both ends
to transfer them from the APPLE ][ to the KAYPRO.
this is not the rpeferred method, however. There
is no checksum or CRC if you use PIP.
Best of luck...
Doug

If the files are DOS text files you can use ASCII EXPRESS
to transfer them out the seriel port.

The info I gave you in my first message would refer
to the situation where the APPLE ][ is running CPM.

Apple *does not* use a hard sectored format.  Its uses a 16 sector format
which *does not* use the index hole, thus soft sectored.  Software is
able to find any given track/sector without the aid from the hardware.
 
When using a communications program on the Kaypro (i.e. modem7 or mex)
and Apple (i.e. ASCII Express "The Professional), avoid using the xmodem
(Christensen) protocol if possible.  Invoke the Apple's comm program to
list the file and copy the data into the buffer of modem7 or mex.  Protocol
is possible, but the file has to be processed after the transfer.
 
Apple's method of terminating a line in a text file is just a carriage
return -- with no linefeed.  So when you type the file out in CP/M, every
line will be overwritten.  Solve this by processing the file with FILTEX
(a public domain program) or some other utility that inserts a LF after
every orphan CR.  Likewise, a CP/M text file transferred to an Apple will
contain that *normal* LF and appear double-spaced when listed.

Two popular CP/M cards are available for the Apple:  the "Softcard" by
Microsoft and the "Appli-Card" by PCPI.  They sell for about $275.00.
Each card comes with a utility disk that includes a program to convert
DOS files to CP/M.

Hello,

I've read the recent messages re how to read Apple disks from a Kaypro
(or other CP/M system).  Most responses involve connecting the two
computers (Apple and CP/M system) with a serial or modem connection,
and maybe or maybe not buying a CP/M card for the Apple.

Just to inform you of a somewhat wilder kludge that (remarkably enough)
worked after a fashion.

I had some Apples running Pascal on a Corvus Omninet.  Didn't have any
Omninet connections for my CP/M system (a Decision I - the big S100 buss
sucker).

Used a serial card (Super Serial, I think) in the Apple slot normally
used when attaching an external terminal (forget the number now, but it's
in Apple and Super Serial Card documentation).  Used the normal Omninet
card in the Apple, plus its 16K Language card.

Fired up the Toad (the Decision I) and hard-wired to the Apple's serial
port as a terminal.  Used a modem program (MODEM730, in this case) in
T mode (terminal) to actually run the Apple, and used file buffering and
saving (also from T mode) when I wanted to save something from the Apple.
(Just told it to type - or the equivalent Pascal term.)

Worked really well, except for some Pascal screen-addressing commands
built into our Omninet shell that I didn't want to mess with.  But for
straight serial data - no problems at all!  Worked with 8-bit also, by
the way.  Donno what I'll do with Apple binary code on the Toad, but
there it is!

So, if you're working back-to-back (might even work over a modem!), that
is ONE way - and you don't need a CP/M card in the Apple either.

David Kirschbaum

Those poor lonely CRs can be fixed quickly in WORDSTAR using the
following procedure

1. Edit the file using the "N" or "D" option from the WS main menu.
2. Execute the search and replace by typing ctrl-Q and "A" and return.
3. Respond to the FIND? with a ctrl-P and ctrl-M and return.
4. Respond to the Replace with? with ctrl-N and return
5. Respond to the Options? with GN and return.

The complete file will be fixed.

Note If you quickly follow the return after the 'GN' with a ctrl-Q, an A,
and a return, the display will not be updated during the changes.
This makes the change take place significantly faster. In
point of fact, you can use a ctr-k and a space to eliminate
the display updating. I "discovered" this by accident one day
when I was impatiently waiting for WORDSTAR to finish up.
Hope this helps.

I have done most of the work on the DECmate MODEM overlay, so perhaps I can
help.  You should first check the overlay file to see if it really is
a version that has the most recent DECmate code in it.  The problem is that
the 6120 (PDP-8) processor in the DECmate II handles all the I/O, and in
particular it grabs any XON/XOFF's (^S/^Q) and does its own flow control
without passing them on to the Z80.  It is possible, however, to command
the 6120 to not do this and pass thru everything.  This is what the overlay
does, in the initialization subroutine.  You should look at the source
code in the overlay that you have to see if that feature exists and is
enabled.  If you do not have the most recent overlay, which is called
something like M7VT-4 (or higher), you can get it from SIMTEL20 or 
DEC-MARLBORO.

Incidentally, I have noticed that MDM730 and higher running on 
DECmate's seem to have a problem with passing thru function key escape 
sequences, in particular the direction arrows.  I think it's some kind 
of timing problem, but I haven't pursued it.  I don't *think* it 
affects file transfer.  Personally, I always use Kermit.

Todd (et al),

Don't think your problem with Kermit-80 not wanting to move binary files
lies within the Kermit-80 code (unless your particular copy got trashed/
changed somehow).

I've got v4.0 running on my Decision I (with a few system-dependent changes
because of the way the Toad handles its ports, and my having to work through
a TAC all the time), and routinely move binary.

I'm sure you know it isn't really binary - the packetized characters are
pure ASCII, prefixed with a unique character if non-visible.

Never tried your system though.  Good luck!

Roger on supporting Sol and his new Micro/Systems Journal.

I subscribed as soon as I found out about it (rots of ruck on getting MY
money back from Ziff-Davis too!).

I'm still contentedly hacking away in my CP/M/MP/M environment, and am quite
happy to read about something other than PC peripherals and MS-DOS.

And of course I remain a faithful Dr. Dobbs subscriber (and occasionally
even understand most of it!).

So another unsolicited endorsement for Sol Libes and his Journal.

Lee (et al),

Needing a good random number generator myself, I scrounged around all OVER
the nets and literature, and have about everything available out there.

What I do NOT have is the training/knowledge/techniques to tell if ANY of
them are truly any good!

Various authoritative sources are quite free at warning how difficult it is
to generate true random numbers (EVERYTHING is called "pseudo.."), but
do darned little to provide a solution!

I don't know enough about proper mathematical/logical testing to prove
anything myself (and am sorely tried at this point, depending very much on
random numbers on an encryption scheme I've been working on for 9 months
now).

Any methametical geniuses out there who can point me to NOT a long and deep
discussion on the validity/nonvalidity of generation methods, but a clean
SOLUTION!?

Re the original query.. I can list what I DO have and maybe move it to you
one way or another if you just want some code to play with.  I just can't
tell you if it's any GOOD or not!

NetLandians,

Scientific American Magazine, Dec 84, had a stimulating article in their
regular Computer Recreations column about a water world simulation, where
sharks and fishes fought their eternal struggle.

Article was VERY well done and most interesting.  The program discussed
was described well.  I just wondered if anyone had the code for this program.
I don't mind writing it myself (the description is that good), but have
little time right now.

Thanks in advance,

David,

  The differerence between random numbers and pseudo random numbers is
that while pseudo random numbers APPEAR to be random, the same sequence
of numbers will be generated each time the pseudo generator is run.
This is of course due to the fact that the same code is being executed
each time the program is run.  A way to prevent this from happining it
to SEED the pseudo generator with some truly random number from outside
the program i.e. a number from the system clock or the number of clock
ticks from a prompt to the reaction time to type something back to the
prompt.  If you need something that is truly random reguardless of seed
even, then you may have to resort to a hardware hack such as the input
from a ADC (analog to digital converter) with it's input comming from
a "white noise generator".  This would be truly random (make sure that
the white noise generator is an analog device and not one of the newer
"digitaly derived" generators).  Hope this helps.

Regards, Paul Grupp  <GRUPP@MIT-MC.ARPA>

I recently purchased the newly introduced MIX Editor which was
advertised in Dr. Dobb's Journal.  Because of recent net discussion
on the subject of editors, I thought I would share my findings.

According to the MIX Editor, herein called MIX, user manual
introduction, MIX is described as a full screen,
programmable text editor designed for entering programs.  The
three features that make MIX a great tool are:
     1) it allows the screen to be split either vertically or
        horizontally for simultaneous editing of two files,
     2) it is programmable via user defined macros built from
        the 100+ predefined editor commands, and
     3) it can be customized for different terminal or 
        application configurations via user defined setup
        files.

Editing is accomplished by using either the predefined key
sequences or by entering commands by name from command mode.  Key
layout and commands are patterened after Wordstar but can be
customized to user specification.  In addition to the many
familiar editing commands are some useful new commands such
as auto indent, change disk, display line numbers and autoline.
Autoline automatically increments and includes lne numbers when
entering BASIC programs.  Auto numbering is provided for inserted
lines as well, but there does not appear to be a way to renumber
should the need arise.  Also included are commands to duplicate
and center lines and to 'undelete' mistakenly deleted words or
lines.  While the split screen feature is a welcome addition, I
found that the vertical split mode did not behave as described in
the manual when invoked on my NEC PC8800 computer.

MIX comes with a 100 page user manual that does a good job of 
explaining the editor commands and features.  There are a few
samples of setup files and macro definitions but there could be
more.  Noticeably absent, however, is a command quick-reference
card.  I think one would be very useful particularly because of
the many special commands and multiple invocation modes.  A file
on the distribution diskette contains explanations and examples
of useful patches for the .COM and .OVY files and includes a
section detailing special cursor addressing.

All things considered, I must agree with the advertising copy
statement that MIX is "a powerful addition to any programmer's
tool box."  MIX provides many features not found in more 
expensive editors and is a bargain at the introductory price of
$29.95 plus $5 shipping (US).  MIX is available for PCDOS/MSDOS or
CPM80 in a number of formats and can be obtained from:

	Suite 363

For every problem there is one           	Dave Beyerl
solution which is simple, neat,                 ihuxk!db21

Reply-To: "R. MEIER" <rmeier@SU-STAR.ARPA>

Todd,
	I too have been using Kermit-80 v4 for routinely transferring
binary and text files without difficulty.  On the mainframe end, there
has been a Kermit-32 (VMS) and a UxKermit (Unix).  I encountered a
frustrating problem when I originally brought up Kermit v3, which might
be of help.  My version of Kermit used an unremembered character to
indicate characters > 80h, but both mainframe kermits used '&'.  This
was a simple problem, but I used Kermit for about 2 weeks without
realizing why it would not transfer binary files, but would transfer
most (but not all) text files.
	Another possibility to check is that you are using the correct
error detection code.  I have heard that some mainframes use 6-bit crc
on text files, but expect 12-bit crc on binary files.
	Both of the above problems should result in getting a large number
of retries (> 4, probably 20) for each packet.  If you don't get a quick
fix, or a pointer that solves the problem, you might try posting your
symptoms.  As a test to see if the first problem is correct, you might
try sending some text files in binary mode.  You should get correct copies
of the text files with garbage appended to the end.

A  week  or  so  ago,  I  asked  the net about the feasibility of
someone who has an APPLE IIe doing some draft typing for me,  and
then  transferring  the material to my KAYPRO for finalizing, The
key issues were:

    .   Can one use something like UNIFORM to read  APPLE II
        disks of the KAYPRO?

    .   Other problems or solutions?

I  got  a  number  of  responses,  including  some requests for a
summary of responses.  I have summarized the comments, eliminated
most of the inevitable redundancy,  and  am  submitting  the  end
result for the use of those who may be interested.

In  a  nutshell,  EXCEPT  for  modem or direct RS-232 transfer of
ASCII files, and the subsequent manipulation of those files  with
a filter like FILTEX, it's not feasible to move drafts from APPLE
to  CP/M systems, and back.  Even with modem-like approaches it's
cumbersome.

Thanks to all who contributed their insights and experiences,

Eric

               Summary of APPLE <--> CP/M Responses 

1.0.  Is there any way I can read text  files  off  an  Apple  II
disk, using a Kaypro II?  Is there a formatting program that will
do that?


Unfortunately,  you  cannot  read  or write Apple disks on a CP/M
system like the Kaypro.  The reason for this is that Apple uses a
HARD SECTORED "maverick" format unlike  every  other  system  out
there  which  uses  SOFT  sectoring (which is what makes programs
like MediaMaster and Uniform possible).

It should be possible to write the RWTS (read-write-track-sector)
code that resides at BD00-BFFF in an APPLE ][ in  8080  code  and
make  it  run  in  a  KAYPRO.   The hard part would be to get the
documentation which describes how you access  the  disk  directly
from 8080 code in the KAYPRO.  You would need to know how to turn
on  the  motor,  how to check for write protect, how long to wait
after turning on the motor before reading, what the  data  really
looks  like  when  you  do  a  read (bit-by-bit read) and how you
define which disk drive you want to access.  I  do  not  know  if
this information is available for the KAYPRO.


Apple  diskettes  use  a  SOFT  sectored  scheme, but the data is
encoded using a GCR technique instead of  the  more  popular  MFM
method.   Most  systems  (if  not  all) would not be able to read
them.


Apple *does not* use a hard  sectored  format.   Its  uses  a  16
sector  format  which  *does  not*  use the index hole, thus soft
sectored.  Software is   able  to  find  any  given  track/sector
without the aid from the hardware.


In  truth, the apple is 'softer' sectoring than anybody else - it
doesn't look at the sector hole(s) *AT ALL*.  Therefore  one  can
use  in  the  apple  either soft or hard sectored disks providing
that you format them first.  It is this 'softer'  sectoring  that
makes  the  apple weird - all other normal machine do look at the
index hole - a hard sectored disk drives them wild.


2.0.  Is it economical to get my potential typist a CP/M card for
her Apple?  Are they still made?  Where and by whom?  Costs?


There is no way to read an apple disk in  a  Kaypro  disk  drive,
with  or  without  CP/M  in the Apple.  The Apple hardware uses a
very unique coding scheme for putting bits on the  disk.    About
the  only  practical  thing to do is use modems in both machines,
and transfer the files over the phone line.   This  is  practical
and  easy.  (Or if the machines are close together, you can cable
the serial ports on  the two machines directly  together  without
modems.   This  takes  a  little knowledge and the willingness to
wire up a special connector.)

Apple's method of terminating a line in a text  file  is  just  a
carriage  return  -- with no linefeed.  So when you type the file
out in CP/M, every line  will  be  overwritten.   Solve  this  by
processing the file with FILTEX (a public domain program) or some
other utility that inserts a LF after every orphan CR.  Likewise,
a  CP/M  text  file  transferred  to  an  Apple will contain that
*normal* LF and appear double-spaced when listed.

Another potential problem is that not all word processors on  the
Apple II (or any other machine) use the same kind of files.  Some
Apple  II  word processors use Apple DOS 3.3 or ProDos "standard"
text files, but others use their own unique  file  format.   Some
achieve  protection  by screwing up the DOS and writing the whole
disk in a wierd way.   So it matters  which  word  processor  she
uses!

I  have  transferred files from an APPLE ][ to a KAYPRO using MEX
on the KAYPRO and ZPRO on the APPLE  ][  over  a  null  modem  at
speeds  of  up to 9600 baud.  It worked beautifully.  I initially
did it using modems at 300 baud and a phone, but found  that  the
phone line is unnecessary if you have a seriel card in  the APPLE
][,  you  can  easily use a null modem cable.  A null modem cable
can easily be built.  It is simply a  pair  of  db-25  connectors
(Males usually) that have the following pin connections: Pin 1 to
pin  1,  pin  2  to pin 3 at the other end, pin 3 to pin 2 at the
other end, pin 7 to pin 7, pin 6 to pin 20 at the other  end  and
pin  20  to pin 6 at the other end.  The idea is to swap the send
and receive lines and the dtr and cts  lines.   If  you  have  an
APPLE  ][  super  serial  card,  then  you  don't  need  to build
anything.  You can set the configuration block  to  the  TERMINAL
mode and use your existing db-25 cable.  Read the book and you'll
see  that  this  configuration is the same as having a null modem
cable.

It  is  also  possible  to  use  MEX,  MODEM7,   or   any   other
xmodem-capable  program to do quick APPLE ][ to KAYPRO transfers.
I like using MEX because it has wild card capability.

If the files you need to transfer are ascii, rather than  binary,
it  is possible to use PIP on both ends to transfer them from the
APPLE ][ to the  KAYPRO.   this  is  not  the  rpeferred  method,
however.  There is no checksum or CRC if you use PIP.

If  the  files  are  DOS  text files you can use ASCII EXPRESS to
transfer them out the seriel port.

Two  popular  CP/M  cards  are  available  for  the  Apple:   the
"Softcard"  by Microsoft and the "Appli-Card" by PCPI.  They sell
for about $275.00.  Each card comes  with  a  utility  disk  that
includes a program to convert DOS files to CP/M.

On  the  CP/M  card  add-on...   just  went  through  this with a
customer in an "attempt" to upgrade his Apple.  Take  a  look  at
the December issue of Byte Magazine - there's a multi-page review
of  these  things in the back.  But changing to a CP/M card won't
solve a disk compatibility problem.   Since  they  all  use  that
Apple drive, they're constrained to use the hardware and firmware
designed to drive 'em.

                               ###

To: info-cpm@AMSAA.ARPA


Cuccia's (non) solution is an example of my problem.  I call it a non-solution
because (1) it defines a constant M >> the upper limit allowed in most Z80
Pascals, and (2) the statement x := (x*A) mod M is eventually gonna overflow.

Another problem: A and M relatively prime is NOT sufficient to guarantee good
statistical properties of a rn generator.  

So, in more direct form, here is my problem:  I am writing a journal article
that includes a monte-carlo statistical simulation.  I know that the journal
@i(requires) a "good" rn generator--most people use IMSL.  A good rn generator
is one that passes a wide variety of statistical tests for randomness. 
Therefore, I must now find a "good" generator for the Z80, or port my program
over to a mainframe with IMSL.

I have nothing against linear congruential generators as suggested by Cuccia,
but I gotta know what the right constants are for my z80, and I hafta have
a citation that says they are the right ones, else the journal will laugh
and say, "resubmit when you have duplicated your results on a real computer."

One last point--I have tested the built in random in Turbo Pascal, and it sure
isn't random.

In writing game programs for the "KIDS", I use the internal clock
counter locations in the computer to seed a nominal ramdon number
generator.  It appears to get rid of the Pseudo part of it, in that the
system "never" starts at the same place.
Hours*minutes*seconds*day*month*year kind of thing seems to do pretty
good.

Subject: PD Modem control programs for CCP/M or MP/M
To: Info-Cpm@AMSAA.ARPA

Upon (finally) receiving Viasyn/ComuPro's Concurrent DOS 816, I
discovered a problem: all my public domain modem software expects to
directly control the hardware, bipassing the OS to do status polling;
since Concurrent doesn't give its exclusive attention to the modem
control program, I lose characters when inputting a continuous data
stream at 1200 baud with *anything* else running concurrently.

Have any of you running CCP/M in any of its various incarnations, MP/M
86 or MP/M 816 found a modem control program, either public or
commercial, which can run as a background task?  Has anyone succesfully
hacked a MEX, MDM840, MDM901, or MDM7XX overlay to exist in this
environment?

If not, I have thought that one of the above overlays might be made to
work if it polled a CCP/M AUX device, since Viasyn/CompuPro tells me
these are handled in the same fashion as TTY devices, i.e., a ring
buffer filled by an interrupt driver.  This solution only works on
input, however, as I believe the function code 0FFh must be used to
signal input.  Anybody tried something similar?  I'm flying blind on
this one 'till my System & Programmer's manual arrives, so I don't know
*exactly* what the function codes are or do.

Please advise soonest if you know a solution.

^X^XMMoon --

1.	I also just this week received my Concurrent CP/M (they don't
call it ConcurrentDOS, for some funny reason).  Along with my OS,
Viasyn/Compupro packages AMCALL/MCALL-II, which comes configured for
Concurrent.  I'm surprised you didn't also receive this modem program.

2.	Though I haven't checked, I'm under the impression that
there's a Modem840 that's configurable for MP/M-86 (816) that has an
RSP monitoring the modem port.  You might look to see whether or not
this is true.

3.	Did you also have to pay $28 for the programmer's
documentation???  This is another place I think Compupro really pulled
a questionable move...  I had to pay the extra $28 just to get the
programmer's guide and system guide!!!

big big clue to my much sought after answer.  I am embarrassed to
say that the following is all that needs to be done to make
binary transfers work.

	C-Kermit side
		set file mode binary
		set parity even		{never thought of changing
					 from none to even!}
	Kermit-80 side
		set file-mode binary
		set parity even		{default is none}

I've tested sending and receiving a couple of binary files.  Seems
to work fine.  Thanks to all who sent suggestions!..todd

Use the "Find and Replace" command; for the "find" string, enter
a ctrl-N; for the "Replace" string, enter a <cr> (or if you want to 
replace the hard carriage return with a blank, enter a space; for 
"Options", enter GN.  Then when Wordstar starts to update the screen, 
hit any key to stop screen updates and speed up the process.  This will 
result in one long line of text, so you will have to re-format after the
replacement is over.  

What I do when I wat to remove hard carriage returns from a text file,
is to invoke the Find and Replace command at the beginning of the 
file, with ctrl-N for the find string, space for the replace string, and 
just a N for the option, then scroll through the file, hitting a
ctrl-L for each carriage return I want to remove (the ctrl-L simply
repeats the last Find and Replace command entered); then at the end
of each paragraph, enter a ctrl-B (re-format) to reformat the paragraph
to your desired margins with soft carriage returns within the paragraph.

Netlandians,
	I saw this editor (VDO 2.3) running on a KAYPRO and it was very nice.
It uses a subset of the WS command set, complete enough for most quick editing
tasks.  Main limitation is that it loads entire file into memory, however this
same limitation also makes it very fast.  But the thing that makes it
irresistible is that it is only *5K* !!
	The documentation has a section on installation and modification, which
says to alter the source code.  Looked in the original library and guess what...... NO source.  Does anyone have the source for this thing?  The version my
friend showed me came from a .lbr file called VDO23KP.LBR.  If you have the
source, or know where I can get it, please let me know; care of APA@CMU-CS-C.

MM(ushr)oo(m/n) --

Yes, sir, my system is a 696/S-100 system also, with rev id 3.1D.
Looks like the same one.  I think they told me that if you bought
MP/M-816 after a certain date, you got the update free, but without
the modem program.

I have a feeling there's a lot of song and dance left; there's still
the hurdle of MSDOS 2.0 (or greater) compatibility.  I'm sure looking
forward to that one.

Tip for ex-MP/M-816 users:  SYSTAT from ConcurrentDOS works finely
under MP/M-816.  Kind of makes me want to try some of the other
utilities...  

I can't use ConcurrentDOS yet since I'm having trouble booting it.
(Can anyone help: The disk drives step about 15 times, loading the
.SYS file, I think, then do what sounds like 2 whole-disk seeks, and
dies.)

is a problem when we switch from camera A to cam B.  The tape slows down 
because its going back into the seach mode.  At least this is what ive been

	Question!  If When I whant to switch from A to B I invoke a vertical
sync till source B goes into its natural vert sync then let b take over will
I still get the moter slow down into search?  

	The video monitor will black out for a max of 1 frame but this is
ok, since the eye will not really see this.  

	Well if any one out there in net land has any video recorder servo

In-reply-to: Msg of 4 Apr 1985  13:42-MST from sac at mitre-bedford.ARPA

    I have ftp'd 2 .LBR's and I want to unpack them under UNIX. This would
    allow me use of the high speed printers. Question: How and where is
    the program?
    		Thanks!

Here is a q&a session that answers most questions about LBR files.

Re:   How to find out what .LBR files are

    A question: what exactly are these LBR (library?) files?

See MICRO:<CPM.CPMLIB>LU310.DQC

    Is there some special tool that must be employed to pry them open
    (like "ar" on UNIX for object libraries)?  Is that tool available
    on Simtel-20?

Yes, get MICRO:<CPM.CPMLIB>LU310.COM

    Is there a version of it runs under UNIX?

No, not a completely compatible one.  The closest thing is
MICRO:<UNIX.CPM>LAR.C

    I've been keeping a small public database of messages relating to
    the Simtel library culled from info-cpm.  These messages include
    comprehensive documents from you and a few other people that
    describe how to make access to Simtel-20 and what the various
    file types are, but sadly, I cannot find any description of LBR
    files among them.

A complete description of the official file structure of .LBRs is in
MICRO:<CPM.CPMLIB>LUDEF5.DQC.

KAYPRO II VIDEO SOFTWARE DRIVER.

The KAYPRO II video section was designed to imitate the control
sequences of a Lear-Siegler ADM-3A terminal.  For most commercial
software, this means you can "install" or customize the display
characteristics by choosing the ADM=3A from the menu.  For custome
software or those instances where there is no choice of "ADM-3A" on
the menu, the following information may help.

The following is a list of the KPRO II "Terminal" attributes and
control sequences.

Cursor Control -

Thanks for all the suggestions.  The most common, and quickest for me to use
was to ^QA for a ^N and then just replace it with a null.  It worked fast
once I hit the escape key.  (For those of you who are unaware, if you are
doing a global replace, i.e., the gn option, if you hit the escape key, the
screen doesn't show each line getting changed.  It really speeds things up.)

I also had several suggestions regarding two PD programs, ENSOFT and FIXTEX.
Both are out at SIMTEL20.  If I had to do this a lot (which I don't) then I
would probably grab one or both of those pgms.  But for the quick and dirty,
the first method works fine.

     You neglected to state whether or not the VTR was consumer or professional.
The motor slows down during the switch because (evidently) this is its free
running speed in absence of a tach pulse (vertical sync). You can adjust this
parameter in some VHS recorders but it screws up freeze frame, etc.

     It might be possible to genlock the two cameras; if they use a sync 
generator such as the MM5321 (National) or the "other" popular one made by
Fairchild. What has to happen here is to drive both cameras from a single
timebase (probably originating in a 14.318 mc crystal) as well as sending the
frame 1 line 1 signal to reset the "other" camera(s). This will have other
benefits as well, not the least of which is a consistent colour burst phase
from camera to camera WITH RESPECT TO THE 4 FIELD SEQUENCE. 

     The vertical sync (and horizontal sync) is then hopefully genlocked, which
would allow hot switching during the vertical interval.

     There is simply no hope otherwise, as consumer recorders (indeed, all
recorders) cannot cope with hot asynchronous switching without a time base
corrector. The time constant in the head servo of a VTR is extremely long,
and cannot be made to recover in a frame time. Besides, how do you expect to
handle wrong field edits asynchronously?

      I could see a way if you could send "advanced VTR sync" such as a line
store type time base corrector uses, but this is strictly a hackage for the
not-so-weak-of-heart.

     Sorry, but genlocking is a fact of life for those "professional" switchings,
and there just isn't any other economical way to do it. The time base correctors
required cost $10,000 or so each minimum, you'll need 1 and want 2.

     If you are serious, get some reasonable JVC E.N.G. type cameras that can
be genlocked.....

Yes, you'll find it on SIMTEL20 as:

Filename			Type	 Bytes	 CRC

WSCR.MSG.1			ASCII	   985  BA27H

The .MSG file tells about it.  Run the program without an argument for
a menu.  It works great.

I saw the graphics card last Saturday.  It's real, takes a keyboard,
and was running multi-windowing ConcurrentDOS.  It was using a NEC
monitor, not of good resolution, so there was some alignment problem
at the upper left corner of the screen.  Windows could be moved with
cursor keys (probably also by mouse, but we didn't have one).  For
serious or extended work, I would recommend not using color, as the
resolution is pretty bad.  That could be the 640x200 limitation, or
the monitor; or both.

We were using the top-of-the-line Keytronics keyboard, and my friend
Ed was of the opinion that the next model lower down in the line would
have sufficed; the one he had was overly fancy.

SuperCalc3 needs MSDOS 2.0, and therefore wouldn't generate graphics.
Lotus 1-2-3 ran.  (That was a surprise).  (This all hearsay from Ed,
my Compupro system center friend.  I wasn't able to stay too long.)
We're still trying various packages.  dBase3 didn't run.

Ed recommends Alloy for cartridge tape backup.  Says they're now
reliable and easy to use.

If anyone has corrections to the above, please let me know.  I'd like
more information myself.

     WORDSTAR FILES AND CARRIAGE RETURNS
                -- Glen Cooper
 
FMT to WordStar users have been encountering
a bothersome problem--every time they down-
load the former to the latter each line ends
in a hard carriage return (making WordStar
think every line is its own paragraph).
 
WordStar normally ends each line with a
"soft" carriage return (8D hex) as well as a
line feed (0A hex), but for any line which
happens to be at the end of a paragraph, the
soft carriage return is made "hard" (0D hex)
by having the higher-order bit turned off.
This difference is required because WordStar
justifies paragraphs, not line ranges, and
the program needs to know where each para-
graph ends.
 
Unfortunately, WordStar does not distinguish
between soft and hard returns in its editing
commands so users cannot easily make hard
returns soft. MicroPro suggests deleting the
hard returns and reformatting. This can be
very tedious when large files produced by
other programs need to edited by WordStar and
all the returns are hard. For example, files
produced on a mainframe and downloaded onto a
microcomputer by a communications program may
only have hard returns.
 
An easier way around this problem is demon-
strated in the following MicroSoft Basic
program which takes a file on drive B (called
HARD) and transforms it into a new file on
drive B (called SOFT) where all carriage re-
turns are made soft:
 
 
   100 REM
   110 REM from hard to soft carriage returns
   120 REM
   130 OPEN "I",#1,"B:HARD"
   140 OPEN "O",#2,"B:SOFT"
   150 IF EOF(1) GOTO 190
   160 LINE INPUT #1,L$
   170 PRINT #2,L$+CHR$(141)+CHR$(10);
   180 GOTO 150
   190 END
 
Note that this program assumes each line of
B:HARD ends in a hard carriage return.
 
After running the program you can then use
WordStar to mark the end of paragraphs by
hitting the return key anywhere on those
lines which end them (making sure insert mode
is off to avoid unwanted line breaks).
Another way to do this would be to end each
paragraph beforehand with a special symbol
(i.e., one which is not used for anything
else in the file) and then use WordStar's
global find and replace command to change all
special symbols to hard returns.

A. Why not add a genlock module to one of your cameras, or get a
Panasonic
3170 or one other consumer/genlockable camera?. Then you could use my
$450
switcher (via Sony) & not only do Vertical/Int switching, but
fades/dissolves
as well, & split screen wipes, horizontal, or vertical, or color keying
for titles,
or special color effects, some very wild, like change a persons white
shirt to
red,yellow, cyan, etc, or tint the grass to be greener.

With a digital switcher and genlocked cameras, your picture synch's are
then fully broadcast comapatible. I moved up to the $2995 JVC 600 line
camera, for single shoots, or can balance with internal color bars to my
JVC S-3, or old Sony 2000, or even RCA C001 for a 2 camera video.

B. Get a TBC!. I just added a Sony Insert 3/4" machine; but gave up
following what you want to do.  To go from one machine to another;
unless you lock the synch's together, you'll have timing problems.
Timing can be cured with a TBC.
time base corrector (TBC's =  $6000 ) 

A. With my new($700-used) Sony flying erase/insert edit 3/4" machine,
I can tape directly to my 3/4" from one camera, & from Camera 2 to my 2d
VCR; & then dub from the 2d VHS machine over the lst video and have a
two camera shoot; but it means a lot of post production editing.. That's
why there are so many Hollywood Post-production houses with TBC's for
getting a final product.

I'm considering buying a 10 or 20MB winchester for my H89 (I know,
throwing new money after old, right?) and I was wandering through
my latest Heath catalog and couldn't find any such animal.  I could
have sworn there was one at some point.  1) was there, is there still,
and can someone tell me how to get info on it (price, etc.) and 2) if
Heath has never had such an animal, has anyone done something else in
the way of drive and controller from another vendor which is relatively
simple to put install and if so, could you send me some info?
BTW, I have CP/M 2.2.

	We got in a shipment of hard-sectored disks for our Apples by
mistake. I attempted to use them, as I could also see no reason the Apple
couldn't use hard-sectored disks (you are of course right about the Apple
using soft sectoring). Well, the hard sectored disks formatted perfectly,
and *seemed* to work at first, but quickly began to get habitual write
errors. These were good, name-brand disks, by the way.
	I can't fault your logic - I still don't understand why the hard-
sectored disks didn't work. But I thought I'd better warn those who want
to try it to be cautious - don't be too quick to commit valuable files
to these disks.

is on the PC-SIG disk number S217-16.  I looked on SIMTEL20 and DEC-MARLBORO

    I have taken the plug and acquired the above machine because of the
irresistable combination of cause and amount of software available.  I
believe **MOST** C-64 software runs on the SX.  My son is 6, and except
for rare excursions on my lap, has not touched a computer.
    If you have experienced any educational software and will volunteer
comments to me, I would appreciate it.  If this has been covered before,
please give me a pointer, I travel A LOT and could have easily missed
the subject.  If I receive any direct comments, I will collate, respect
your annonymity (if so desired), and post a summary to the net, if so
desired.
    Thanks.

RE:  Detailed information on Kaypro II video driver

Note  that  these  codes  are  for the older, original Kaypro II (sometimes
called a 2'83).  The new Kaypro 2's, (often referred to as 2'84's) and 2X's
and  4's  have  the  same  capabilites  as the original Kaypro 10's.  These
include,  in  addition  to those listed for the Kaypro II, video attributes
(inverse,  low  intensity, blink, underline) and text erasure (end of line,
end  of  page).   The  Greek  alphabet is not included in the newer models,
however.

The  newer  boards  (all  Kaypro  8  bit models now contain the same mother
board)  also  support a limited "graphics" capability.  This is handled via
the BIOS in a pseudo pixel addressable mode.

The Kaypro remains, however, a functional superset of the ADM3A.

This message describes several "linear congruential" random number
generators.

A characteristic of the linear congruential method is that the maximum
period is determined by the precision of arithmetic used.  For example,
using 16-bit binary arithmetic, the maximum possible period is 65,535.
To make the period reasonably large, 32-bit binary arithmetic should be
used.  The selection of the multiplier and constant also affect the
period and distribution of the random numbers. (For more on this refer
to Knuth, Semi-Numerical Algorithms)

Here is the random number generator from a Unix system.  It runs on a
VAX which has 32 bit words.

/* @(#)rand.c	4.1 (Berkeley) 12/21/80 */
static	long	randx = 1;

srand(x)
unsigned x;
{
	randx = x;
}

rand()
{
	return((randx = randx * 1103515245 + 12345) & 0x7fffffff);
}



If you have real arithmetic available, you might want to try the
following random number generator.  It generates a real in the range 0 <
n < 1.  This one has a period of 1 million.  It comes from the HP-67
library.

NewSeed := Frac(9821. * Seed + 0.211327)

Caution: be sure to avoid a starting seed equal to (1. - 0.211327)/9821.
That seed will produce a result of zero.  This formula assumes that the
precision of the arithmetic is ten decimal digits or better.


Most random number generators produce uniformly distributed numbers.
Sometimes it is desirable to have normally (Gaussian) distributed
numbers.  The following formula can be used to convert uniformly
distributed numbers into normally distributed numbers with a given mean
and standard deviation.


T = sqrt(-2*ln(rand1))*sin(360*rand2)

G = StdDev*T + Mean

where

rand1 : random number in the range 0 < n < 1
rand2 : another random number in the range 0 < n < 1
StdDev : standard deviation of desired distribution
Mean : mean of desired distribution

Reference
Knuth, Semi-Numerical Algorithms p. 104

The only drawback is that transcendental functions must be evaluated.
This can be speeded up at the expense of memory by the use of table
look-up.

Roz - I got a C-64 for my 3 year old.  My experience has been that the
CBS Software and the Spinnaker Software is really good.  Spinnaker's
Alphabet Zoo might be good for a 6 yr. old (it's too advanced for my 
son.) It needs a joy stick, but if the SX is like the C-64, there should
be a port for it.  It uses the Atari-type joy stick, which is available
from all sorts of places, including your local Radio Shack.  

One additional set of Software that is really quite good is the stuff
from Children's Television Workshop (a.k.a., Sesame Street).  The CTW
software is published by CBS Software.

Hope this helps.

While A (= 2047) and M (= 524287) are mutually prime (HCF = 1), which
is all that is required for the algorithm, A is not a prime number:

	2047 = 23 * 89

which will hopefully discourage 16-bit-machine users from using it
for M (which must be prime for the series to have full period).
Here at DCIEM we use an implementation of the generator described
on p. 464 of Knuth's vol. 2, with k = 55, j = 31.  As no multiplications
or divisions are involved, it is reasonably fast.

It should work if you just do "set parity space" in C-kermit (this turns on

Kermit to work with my Osborne Executive.  Has anyone had better luck
than I in pulling off that trick?  My problem in a nutshell is that when
I go into the CONNECT mode, exactly one character gets sent and then the
program "hangs up." Most of the time I'm even fortunate to be able to
get back to the Kermit command mode without having to reboot.  I
normally use MEX for communication, and am quite happy with it, but now
and then I need the Kermit protocol.  Otherwise, I'd just forget it and
stick with MEX.

Beta-testing has been completed on 15-20
types of CP/M machines and real-time clocks.  To readily
support Apple ][ and Z-100 machines running CP/M 2.2
with a real-time clock, we'd appreciate volunteers with
those systems and ASM programming experience who are willing

Does anyone have any information on:

   1.  The compatability of their MUON operating system with CP/M.
       Hint: I have been told it is an "extended" CP/M BDOS?

   2.  Disk format.  I know it's double sided, but that's about all.
       Is it similar to any other format (eg, KAYPRO).


Since this is not likely to be of general interest, replys by mail would
be appreciated.

Thanks!

I have recently seen an addendum by John Byrns to Ward Christensen's 1982 
MODEM protocol document that discusses the CRC option (both were recently
posted to net.sources).  Has anyone written down "official" protocols
for the batch file transfer mode of MODEM??  Comparing several
different programs, I find that they differ in whether or not the
file-name checksum is to be ACKed or not.  I think these two cases are
mutually exclusive!  Thus, I would like to know the "official" way of
doing things.

I just got an Epson PX-8 and want to be able to transfer
binary files from my Osborne. Currently, I convert the
file to ASCII codes, send that file and use a BASIC
program on the Epson to convert it back again. This works
fairly well but there must be an easier way. If MDM7 can
transfer binary files, I'd like a copy of a PX-8 overlay.
Any suggestions will be appreciated.

The "StarCard" sold by MicroPro with Wordstar is indeed the PCPI
Applicard running at 6Mhz.  I comes with a double sided disk that
contains CP/M 2.2 (may have been updated to 3.0) and all the
standard utilities (STAT, ASM, etc) on one side, and hardware
related utilities on the other.  It is also packaged with a 
beginners book on CP/M, "CP/M Primer".

It is a good package price if you can still get it.

[This line has bugs.... >0OO OO0<]

Hep, ah say, hep me!!!

I  finally decided to replace my *old* upwards from CP/M (tm) 1.4 compatable
Xitan  ELDOS 'operating system' with CP/M 2.2. I wrote a BIOS, including the
guts  of  the ELDOS driver for my Xitan DDDC disk controller, and tested it.
Parts  actually  worked.  I then tried to create a system disk with CP/M 2.2
and my new BIOS and learned, much to my horror, the result was *too big*.

I  realize  that I could just increase the system tracks to 3 from 2, giving
more  room, but I've got a lot of software (150+ diskettes) that assume data
(directory) starts on track 3, so....

[Bright  idea,  after  much  gnashing  of teeth, pulling of hair, renting of
clothing,  although  I now realize that others (Heathkit) have done it, too]
"I'll  put  the CCP in a file (CCP.SYS), BDOS and BIOS on the system tracks,
and  have  the  cold  and warm starts load the CCP from disk using BDOS file
I/O. That'll give me plenty of room."

Soooo,  I  modify  the  BIOS  boot  to call BDOS to open CCP.SYS, read in 16
records, and presto, the CCP is loaded, right?

Wrong.  For  some  unexplained reason, no data is transferred. DDTing though
the  BIOS  I  find  that  a) CCP.SYS is opened just fine (FCB modified, disk
accessed,  no errors returned, an' ever'thing) but b) when BDOS is called to
read each record, no disk activity occurs although BDOS returns with 0 in <A
(that's  register  A,  for  all  you ZBUG fans), saying everything's kosher.
Balderdash!!!

If  I've  managed to leave the CCP in place (after DDTing old CPM.SYS), CP/M
executes normally, impling that my BIOS is alright, and that BDOS is alright
(I  can  execute STAT.COM and other .COM's, TYPE files, etc.). However, if I
zap  the  CCP before executing the warm start, BIOS thinks it loaded the CCP
from CCP.SYS and tries to execute garbage.

I  *must*  be  doing something wrong, but what? Help. ELDOS is too large and

 I have some problems with VFILE.CMD (version 1.2). When I run it under 
 MPM-816 (in a Compupro system with a Q540 Hard disk) it hangs the system
 when I try to log into C5:, B6: or B10: (from any drive or user area).
 I also hangs when the program is invoked from C5, B6 or B10. I can abort
 from another console but the system starts getting flakey after this. 

 The previous version (1.1) works very well. Has anybody noticed this type of
 problem with VFILE (1.2)?
 
 I had been using version 1.2 for some time in my home system and never noticed
 anything amiss, but I had never tried to access these drives and areas with it.
 Most of the time I use other disk programs and these user areas have very 
 little activity.

 The problem showed up when checking a new Compupro (MPM-816) system I 
 installed in my lab. By pure chance I tried VFILE in C5 and the system hanged.
 Since it was consistent I checked all the other drives and user areas and
 found B6 and B10. Assuming the problem was in the system we started checking
 the hardware. Couldn't find anything wrong. Finally decided to try my home
 system hard disk with the new mainframe and the problem showed up.
 Then I checked my home system with VFILE and same thing happened.

Does anyone out there have any information on Liquid Crystal Displays

that was used by the late Gavilan.  I just received one of the units, and
desparately need to interface it into a homebrew portable system.  The unit
has two connectors on the rear, a 10-pin inline, and a 4-pin inline which
may be the power connection.

   Would appreciate any info on connection, and interfacing data.  Trying
to obtain such from here in Germany is a bit of a problem.

Right, the Starcard is the PCPI card.  And yes, it does come
with the CP/M utilites and device drivers.  MicroPro supplies

Does anyone know where to get-nuts-and-bolts technical information
about the PCPI Applicard?  I was recently given one as a gift by
someone who got it for free as part of a package with wordstar
software.  He already had a CPM card for his Apple II clone, so he
didn't need the Applicard, and gave it to me.  Unfortunately the
documentation he got with it is *very basic*, tells you how to plug it
in and run wordstar on it, period!  I dont want to run wordstar, but I
would like to run Turbo Pascal on it, and the things I want to do with
it involve needing to know the details of the communication between
the 6502 and the Z80.

Pointers to good books would be most helpful.

Replys by email and I will summarize for the net if there is enough
interest.

Thanks in advance

Bob,

Re your query about sending binary files from your Epson PX-8.  Yep,
MDM7 can send binary just fine, but I hope someone else can point you
to the PX-8 overlay.  Kermit does well with binary too (to LOTS of
different otherwise incompatible systems), but with somewhat more
overhead if it has to ASCIIze midstream.  Haven't heard of a PX-8 version
of Kermit yet.

The scheme you are using [not bringing in the CCP until the system is
up] *should* work just fine.  "There must be a bug there somewhere ..."
[Big help, right?]

Anyway, there is another scheme which CCS uses and might be of use to
you.  If you measure closely, CP/M-2.2 will fit in two tracks on a single
sided, single density diskette *JUST BARELY*.  I believe it has between
384 and 512 bytes left free, depending on bootstrap.

What CCS does is put the system out there with an absolutely minimal
BIOS, just big enough to force BDOS to run a program which reads in
BIOS.SYS into a memory buffer, copy it up over the mini-bios, and exit
with a cold or warm boot (as you choose).  You don't need 
any disk write, fancy error checking, serial port, or printer support.
You don't even HAVE to have a CON: driver.

Obviously the system is
loaded at an address which leaves room at the top of memory for the
full size BIOS.

An advantage over the CCP scheme is that is simplifies warm-starts after
every ^C, the CCP and BDOS are in the system tracks where they belong.
Another advantage (if you play with the BIOS like I do) is that all you
have to do to test out a new BIOS is simply replace the BIOS.SYS file.
No mucking with PUTSYS, GETSYS, or the like.

 The following is an extract from the DOC file:


 It shouldn't happen -- but it does.

 You're  using  your  favorite word processor -- a report, letter,
 program, what-have-you -- and a glitch locks up the terminal.

 Of  course, if you know a lot about how CP/M's memory works, have
 DDT   or   its   equivalent   available,   don't   overlay   your
 text-in-memory  with  DDT  or  its  clone,  know  where your word
 processor's edit space begins, know how to move  the  content  of
 memory  to 100H, know how to find the end of your text in memory,
 know how to figure the number of pages to save -- if you know ALL
 of the above you can save your assets and start over.

 But now there is a better way to SAVE YOUR ASSets - enter SYA.


 SYA is a 3k program that you should keep handy.  Menu-driven,  it
 can  be figured out easily even if yu've not used it for a while.
 If you screw up, just exit SYA and invoke it  again.   Since  you
 don't  have  to  move memory around, you can try as many times as
 you like so long as you don't turn the power off.

 Here's what SYA does:

     .   Starting at the beginning of  the  editor's  storage
         space, SYA dumps memory to the console.

        ..  DUMPing can be a screen-full at a time, or a line
            at  a  time.   Set and reset as you like with the
            'L' command.

        ..  All control characters (exept CR,LF, &  TAB)  are
            filtered  from  the  console,  to keep the screen
            from doing weird graphic things.

        ..  If you DUMP past your text, you'll get garbage on
            the screen, but that will stop eventually.   Then
            you can do 'L', 'B', or 'T' -  see below.

        ..  If you get a long run of garbage without stopping
            (because   SYA   doesn't   encounter  a  stopping
            character), hit any key to  interrupt  the  DUMP,
            then do 'L', 'B', or 'T'.

     .   After each screen, or each line in single-line mode,
         a SPACE or CR will continue DUMPING.

     .   'B' will ask you how many lines you want to back up.

     .   'T' puts you at the TOP of the storage space  again,
         and DUMPS from there.

     .   'L'   (for   LINES)  asks  if  you  want  PAGING  or
         SINGE-LINE dumping.

     .   'S'  will SAVE your file from its beginning to where
         you were when you typed 'S'.

     .   'M' gives you a MENU of options.

     .   'X' will EXIT.  So will ^C.


         I wrote SYA for my own and some friends' use.  As of
         now  it  works  only with Wordstar 3.0, and with the
         old TSC line editor.

 You can easily set up SYA.ASM for YOUR favorite editor, or for any
 other  program  that  uses a defined area   of memory for data (it
 should work for dBASE-II, SUPERCALC, etc.).

   Yes, there are various overlays available for Apple CP/M systems that
you can choose from, depending on your specific serial card/modem combination.
However, I couldn't get MXO-AC-1 to assemble correctly;  I think someone
put it together without thoroughly testing it (this is the version for the
Apple-Cat ][/212a modem under a MicroSoft-clone CP/M card).  The overlays
are available on many RCP/Ms nationwide.  Just look for the one that's
written for your particular modem (or serial card), edit it as desired, ass-
emble it, and MLOAD it into MEX.  If you have problems, try using a MODEM7
overlay -- most of these will work with MEX also.

Using the Anchor Mk XII within BYE.COM

To use the Mk XII you must ascertain if you have the proper rom set.
This can be done by connecting up the modem and typing ATI1 the result
will be a number if the number is 218 then you are ok, if not get on the
phone to Anchor and get them to replace the roms in your modem. This fixes
a nasty habit of the Anchor's which will cause a seizure of the worst kind
if someone calls your modem at 300 baud. Apparently the modem gets confused
when it answers and has to switch baud rate hanging up the entire system.
Thanks to Ed Richter for this information. This tip and the following mod
allow the Anchor to function as a Hayes clone in a BBS situation.

1)Open the modem case using a wide blade screwdriver.  Pry the top
  separate from the bottom.
2)Solder the banded end of a small switching diode such as 1N914 or 1N4148 
  to the RS232 connector pin 20.  Keep the lead long and insert in a piece 
  of sleeving stripped from a wire.  Looking from where the ribbon cable 
  enters the board, this is the center of the 7 pins in the 2nd row from
  the outside of the case.
3)Solder the other end of the diode to a piece of wire.  Slide sleeving 
  over the exposed diode lead for insulation.
4)Solder the other end of the wire to the plus(+) side of capacitor C48.
  This was in the farthest corner of mine.  On newer boards, it is near
  the center of the board.
-----> That's all- not bad for 10 cents!  If you run a Kaypro, see my
       program HANGUP.ASM to see how to use this.  Most versions of BYE
       try to drop carrier via DTR even if they think you don't have it!

Does anyone know where I can get my hands on the METAL message system
software?  I am trying to assemble a RCPM using ZCPR3, and I hear that 
METAL works well in that application.
 
Thanks in advance

Steve,

	I think Echelon sells METAL now.  If not (or anyway), you
can find out more by leaving a message on Z-Node Central.  Z-Node Central
runs METAL.

Notes:

* B3IM-3.DOC - Adapts all modems using Hayes protocol to BYE333 (or
higher) and intelligent modems like:

	 Hayes Smartmodem (300 or 1200 or 2400)
	 Racal-Vadic Maxwell 1200V or 2400V
	 U.S. Robotics (300 or 1200 or 2400)
	 Promodem, Anchor and others

* Many of the inserts in the BYE3-OVL.LBR have been corrected
since BYE332 was released.  Be sure to get the latest version
for your port (BYE3-OVL.LBR dated 4/15/85 which is the one we have
here at SIMTEL20).

* ASMB3.SUB shows how to (more simply) edit and assemble BYE33n.ASM
for multiple versions and/or many changes...  WITHOUT always editing
the humongous 80K source each time.

* BYE3 inserts currently available - BYE3.ASM takes full advantage of
the result codes returned by modems using "AT" protocol.  It uses the
terse mode to recognize the speed of the incoming signal and
automatically adjusts the computer I/O to that speed, without the user
needing to type any CR's.  This is of particular benefit for RCPM
systems using the new 300/1200/2400 modems.

Versions of BYE2 and BYE3 prior to BYE331 have relied on the old PMMI
routine to match the incoming speed by adjusting the I/O baud rate
until recognizing a CR from a string of CR's sent by the user.  That
method is not needed by modems using "AT" result codes.  The PMMI does
not support 1200 or 2400 bps in any event, hence very few are
currently in use.

All the inserts below have been altered to work with the new versions
of BYE3.  2400 bps was added to each from information supplied by the
manufacturer's data sheets and/or overlays developed for MDM7, MEX1,
etc.  BYE3 has an equate to set with the highest speed available for
your modem, whether 300 or 1200 or 2400 bps.

BYE3 includes smartmodem routines developed for use with modems using
the "AT" protocol pioneered by Hayes.  No external smartmodem inserts
are thus needed, except for systems such as the Cermetek which use
their own protocol.  The included smartmodem routines also allow
answering on first ring, with optional echo-checking offered by some
modems for insured accuracy of command accectance.

     REMEMBER:  These are inserts, not overlays.  They go into
                BYE3 at the area specifified by the ++++ char-
                acters, near the start of the program.

Both version 2. and 3. seem to give garbage all overthe screen when

From: Jeff Edelheit <edelheit@MITRE.ARPA>

"How can a user of a USENET host access the public domain
microcomputer software collection on the DDN/MILNET host
SIMTEL20" is being asked with increasing frequency as that
software collection continues to grow.  Unfortunately, direct
access is not possible as there is no UUCP gateway for file
transfer between SIMTEL20 (running TOPS-20) and a USENET host (as
there is for electronic mail).

(DDN, formerly known as ARPANET, is the Defense Data Network.
DDN, along with Arpanet, SATNET, SRINET, etc. are all members of 
a TCP/IP protocol-based, multiple gateway network called InterNet.)

USENET has been built on adjacent hosts voluntarily agreeing to
store-and-forward relatively short messages across the USENET
over dialup lines at 300 or 1200 bps.  In the past, helpful InterNet
users would fetch the file(s) requested and then e-mail them to
the requestor.  However, it has been pointed out that large file
transfers disrupt the service, delay the shorter messages, and
generate unacceptably large phone bills, all of which add up to
threaten the tenuous connections that some USENET hosts can
barely afford to have.  Therefore, we have been asked to
encourage InterNet users not to pass archive programs this way.

Now for the good news.  Some InterNet users, if sent a suitable disk,
will download files and return mail the floppy to the requestor.
To find a friendly InterNet user, send a message to INFO-CPM at DDN
host AMSAA.ARPA via net.micro.cpm identifying your disk format and 
your request.  Usually, someone will respond and come to your aid.
If not, don't be bashful, wait a week and try again.  But please
remember, any such arrangements are strictly between you and your
respondent.  This is not, repeat NOT, a service of either the InterNet
or INFO-CPM.

If the above arrangement is inconvenient, or doesn't work, here
are several other sources for public domain software.


----------------------------------------------------------------------

Information (and prices) are subject to change without notice.  A
volume is usually one floppy disk.


1.  CP/M User's Group

The CP/MUG volumes are available from:

  CP/M User's Group
  1651 3rd Avenue
  New York, NY 10028

Current volumes are numbered 1 through 92 at $13 per 8" SSSD disk

2.  Special Interest Group/Microcomputers (SIG/M)

 The SIG/M volumes are distributed by:

  SIG/M
  Amateur Computer Group of New Jersey, Inc.
  Box 97
  Iselin, NJ 08830

Current volumes are numbered 000 through 172.  The first disk is
$6.00 and $5.00 for each additional disk.  The catalog is $2.


3.  New York Amateur Computer Club

PC-BLUE software volumes for the IBM-PC are available from:

  S-100, CP/M User Group
  The New York Amateur Computer Club
  P.O.  Box 106
  Church Street Station
  New York, NY  10008

The documentation files from the SIG/M and CPMUG volumes are
available in hardcopy form, grouped into "books", from the NYACC.
Each book is priced at $10 including shipping, $15 for overseas
airmail.  All orders must be prepaid.


4.  PicoNet CP/M Users Group

PicoNet, CP/MUG, and SIG/M software volumes are available from:

  PicoNet
  P.O. Box 391566
  Mountain View, CA 94039

Available in 8" and most 5 1/4" soft sector only at $6.00 per
disk plus $1.50 shipping per order.  California residents add
6.5% sales tax.  Quantity discounts are available.


5. Other sources:

Compuserve Information Service is another source of public domain
software. There are a number of special interest groups (SIGs)
devoted to specific hardware as well as CP-MIG, the generic CP/M
SIG, a repository for a large quantity of public domain software
downloadable by the Compuserve file transer protocol (Christensen
protocol is expected by late summer, 1984). There is no charge for
access to CP-MIG other than the standard CIS connect charges, and
Compuserve can be accessed through their own communications network
or through Tymnet.

... and many Remote CP/M (RCPM) systems around the country, where
software is available for downloading for the price of a phone
call.  The May 1984 issue of Microsystems contains the full listing of
known RCPMs at the time of publication.


I would like to thank Dave Towson, Frank Wancho and Charlie Strom for all
their assistance in putting this blurb together.  If anybody out in InterNet
Land has any questions or comments about the above blurb, feel free to

Info on potential trap for MEX users: Modem7 contained default code
for the PMMI modem in the user area.  Some overlays took advantage of
that when no change was required by placing DS's there instead of the
required ANI and CPI code.  No problem with Modem7, but MEX doesn't
work then because there is a RET NOP NOP there.  Two MXO overlays
ACTUALLY exist with this problem - they could never have worked! (Irv
strikes again?).  MXO-DP??.AQM and MXO-TV??.AQM.

I lost about two hours trying to figure that one out.  The program
locked up immediately because the ANI and CPI stuff was missing!

*** MASSAGE THIS LINE WITH YOUR PLACE ***

Yeah, the PCPI 'starcard' is one of the best CP/M cards available on the
apple.  I got it for ~ $185 and thought it was a steal.  If you see it lower,
GET IT!  It comes with CP/M primer, Wordstar 3.3 + manual, CP/M system disk
which includes drivers for 80 col cards or 70 col hi-res (goes slow, but
works).  The card itself is fast.  It also comes with the starcard manual
which explains all you need except for one of the drivers. ( I still can't
figure out what RAMDISK.DVR is used for.  Maybe for the 256K Add-on ramdisk
you can install...)  The WS manual is geared for using the PCPI card, too.

You have your basic cp/m utilities: stat, submit, etc. & one called adosxfer
which transfers files back and forth between dos 3.3 and cp/m.  There is also
a file called dosrdsk or something, which, when transferred to dos 3.3, can
make the extra 64K on the starcard emulate a ramdisk.  When you're using the
card, you can change the apple memory into a printer buffer (35K or so!)

I have used my card for about 3 weeks now (I only have 1 drive and am in
pain...you really need 2 ++).  I do recommend it to *anyone* with a //e
who wants cp/m.  I've used cp/m 3.0 before, but the novelty of cp/m on an
apple makes me forget the problems of cp/m 2.2 .

How does one tell how fast a 64K dynamic ram is? On Intel CPU's they mark
them with -1 (10Mhz) -2 (8Mhz) -3 (5Mhz). Is there a similiar marking on
dynamic rams? What is the fastest 64K dynamic ram available. I have seen some
advertised at 120ns. Are there 100ns 64K rams?

The MODEM7 "batch protocol" was never widely accepted because it is so
very specific to CP/M.

My understanding is that Ward is writing an article for Byte which describes
the "YMODEM" protocol extensions as used by the YAM series of programs.

A file describing the extensions is available on Telegodzilla (503-621-3746)
as YAMPROT.DQC.

A friend has a local organization with a mailing list of ~5000.
He also has an H89 CP/M-80 computer.  Could someone suggest
a mailing list program that need only print address labels for
a newsletter?  The only two specifics are that it needs to sort
on the zipcodes for bulk mailing rate and the 5.25 inch disks
won't hold the entire list, so it must be able to spread across
disks.  A PD program would be nice, but a reasonably priced
commercial product would suffice.  Please respond by mail.

Thanks in advance,

Re:   Squealing diskettes solved

A month or so back I solicited opinions on squealing diskettes.
Yesterday I solved it with a replace of the PRESSURE PAD on the
Shugart 801 drives.  I also WD-40'd the stepper lead screw, and now
seeking is as smooth as velvet, IN SPITE of maintenance people's
advice to leave it "dry" so it doesn't attract dust.

Re:   WD-40 and Shugart

I have lubricated my lead screws for a number of years.  One of my
drives started acting up and I noticed that it was very hard to
manually move the lead screw.  I cleaned the screw completely with a
freon based solvent and then lubricated with a light machine oil.
This speeded up disk access significantly!  Anyway, the choice of
lubricant makes a BIG difference.  After about 6 months I had to go
clean and relubricate the screw.  It got all gummed up.  This time I
used a silicon based spray product.  That attracted less dirt and
lasts about a year.  Cleaning and spraying once a year doesn't bother
me much.  It also a good idea to check the pressure pads at least once
a year.  As they wear out the disk reads and writes become less
reliable.

Yep!  It is just that.  The manuals that come with it are abominable.
However, there is a 50 dollar 'developers manual' available from PCPI.
I ordered one yesterday.  I'll post more info after I have looked at the
it.  I'm told that the Applicard/Starcard will not run Microsoft basic
(either Mbasic or Gbasic)  but have heard rumors that PCPI will sell
a patch to basic (one or the other or both??? Anybody know for sure?)
that solves the problem.  The Starcard comes with one 'flippy' disk
with CPM and the basic cpm utilities on it (PIP, STAT, ED, etc. but not Basic).

PS -- I have also heard rumors that PCPI is 'going big blue' and is not
interested in pushing their Apple products anymore.  Could this explain the low
price for the Starcard?

There was a post awhile back about how to tell if you need to get a new
ROM for your Mark XII.  Mine failed the test, so I called Anchor.  They said
that the ATI1 command reports a checksum, and that if you get
254, 083, or 104, then you should call them.  I got 129, and they said that
is fine.

Also, if AT? responds with an "Error", this means that you have a ROM that
is capable of sending a Break.  If not, the upgrade is $40.

At leat, this is what I think he said.

I have a CP/M-80 system (Apple II with Microsoft Softcard, about 4 yrs
old) and an AT&T PC 6300 running MS-DOS (new).  I would like to send some
of my data files from the Apple to the 6300.  I find that my CP/M system
has a problem in the use of MDM712 and MDM740 (which I just downloaded
from CompuServe).  I can receive files just fine.  I have a problem with
some files when I try to send them in Checksum mode.  None of the systems
to which I have access have CRC mode, so I am unable to test that.

What happens is that (on some files) the receiving end believes that the
transfer has completed prematurely.  For each file that gives me trouble,
there is one consistent spot where this always occurs.  The spot is different
for different files.  I have encountered the same problem now in sending
files to the MS-DOS system, and to a Unix System V with both umodem (2
versions) and uc (2 versions).  This is why I suspect my Apple's software.

I have a relatively short test case (about 4K) that I can send out to
someone who would like to check to be sure that it is MDM7 and not
something peculiar that I have done to my overlay or hardware.

I would be grateful of software for MS-DOS that supports CRC checksum,
in case that will solve my problem.  Another solution would be working
file transmission software for the Apple (modem2 compatible).  Another
solution would be CP/M Kermit, configured for an Apple II with Mountain
CPS card.  If all else fails, raw CP/M Kermit, which I would hack, would
be helpful.

Thanks.  I can't think of anything else I can do.

Pat (et al),

CP/M on a Commodore 64 isn't exactly the CP/M we all know and love!  Things
can get VERY weird out, mixing the 6510 and its environment with the Z80,
CP/M's addressing, etc.  For example, you'll never read anyone else's CP/M
5.25 floppy!  (Nothing but another C64, that is.)  I don't wanna even THINK
about the patching necessary for ports, etc. to transport something like
MODEM7 or Kermit!

Some smart guys are trying to solve some problems.  See Dr. Dobbs, Jan 85,
for a discussion of problems with commercial and other software on the C64
with CP/M.  They did an MBOOT and MODEM7 fix of sorts.  Horror show of
moving code via MBOOT and modem.

Suggest you look at/review articles about the newer Commodore machine that
does full C64 work, plus a slightly better job of CP/M (only slightly).

I won't address prices, etc.  Check recent copies of RUN, COMPUTE!, etc.

Regards, and good luck,

I dug deeply into drive screw lubrication issues a few years ago, and
received advice from the vendor of my system to use ONLY a
Teflon-based lubricant, and that very sparingly.  I've used TRI-FLOW
for years on my and friends 801s, with no problems.  For what that may

Subject: file tran CP/M-80 to MS-DOS problem

The protocol file transfer buffer size is configurable in later
versions of Modem7.  For a 5-1/4" disk, which is relatively slow, the
buffer should be set for no larger than 4k.  If that fails, try 2k.
See the phone number overlay for details on what address to patch.
Make sure that the PC 6300 is initialized for 8 data bits, ONE stop
bit, and no parity.  This is important.

The best oil-type lubricant i have seen for this application
is a product called BREAK-FREE.  The volatile component dries
in about 12 hours, and has little attraction for dust thereafter
For units operating in an extremely dusty environment, you 
might try a product called DRI-SLIDE.  It is Moly-disulfide
in an extremely volatile carrier.  It is completely dry in less
than 24 hours and will work right into the surface of the parts

   Kim Levitt's MBBS is now available -- it's a very nice alternative to
RBBS and its clones.  The .LBR file is 134k and is available on his RCP/M
(MBBS #001) at 213/653-6398, 300/1200bps.  I've asked him about adding it
to Simtel20 -- I'm waiting for a reply.  If you plan to set up an MBBS

The following is an edited copy of an interview that appeared in the 
form of several messages on Ward Christensen's bulletin board.  It 
offers some interesting insight into the life and times of our "CP/M 
Guru".

From: Ward Christensen
To:   Laurence Gonzales
Re:   Interview

I'm a negativist, hater of life, and have a short fuse - it doesn't 
take much to set me off.  That's why I'm into computers - its almost 
like a drug, letting you get so completely wrapped up in it, the "world 
passes you by", i.e. I've been known to have a bad headache or stomach 
ache, but an hour of computing, and I'm oblivious to it, until I stop 
for something.  It's a totally engrossing way to "pass the time".

What I do for IBM and why I like working there?  Well, Very long story, 
but you asked for it.  Lets go back to my Sr. year of high school.  I 
"built" a computer - merely a 10-stage binary counter with phone-dial 
input, and some wires to handle carrying from one "flip-flop" to the 
next, and lights to show output, etc.  After pi__ing away 3 semesters 
at a big university not being sure what I wanted to do with my life 
(still the case, by the way), I dropped out and went back "home" - and 
skipping a few chapters of the book, got asked that since I'd "built" a 
computer in high school, would I like to learn to program them?  This 
was in '65 or so.  I said "sure", and took a few IBM classes in 
Milwaukee, riding into school on my motorcycle.  After a few months, I 
realized that I really liked computers - I was technically inclined, 
and somewhat a loner, and what better thing could there be?  Sure, I 
liked going on motorcycle rides, but not in the winter, etc.

Came time to go back to college, I talked with our IBM Systems 
Engineer, and asked what kind of schooling I should get.  I hoped he 
wouldn't say "business degree", 'cause that turned me off.  No, he said 
math, sciences, etc.  So I went to a small college (now bankrupt, 
R.I.P.) and got a Physics Major, Chem Minor, and hit "deans list" 6 
semesters in a row, then took ONE job interview, IBM.  I figured simply 
that I could either work for someone who USES computers, or someone who 
MAKES them, and the decision sounded easy if I wanted to be "where he 
action is".

However, I wasn't smart enough to go looking for the best job in IBM, 
instead I just interviewed the local office, which was looking for a 
systems engineer - the "technical side of sales", i.e. doing 
configurations, performance planning, helping solve bugs, etc.

I wound up in the Hammond IN branch, and have stuck with it since.

If I had it to do over again, I'd look for a job in research or 
something more technically involved.  Matter of fact, it came as quite 
a shock to find the IBM office back then didn't even have a computer in 
it!  Here I was, working for a computer mfgr, but not working with a 
computer!  I was only able to work with the customer's machines!

So, I guess that got me interested in a home computer.  I remember 
being interested in the very early 70's, and bought a Data General Nova 
instruction manual, got literature from TI on their minicomputers, etc.  
I learned about the 8008 in Jan '74, and taught myself TTL that summer, 
and bought an Altair, the "first popular" computer kit, in early '75.

SO, long answer - what do I do for IBM?  Well, I'm still an SE, but 
have moved up a few jobs - trainee, assistant, associate, se, and now 
advisory.  We are just now starting to have PC's in the offices.

As to my view of "IBM vs my personal contributions" - well, I guess 
that after writing a letter to IBM trying to get them to come out with 
a personal computer, and receiving a reply "we don't think there is a 
market for them", I kind of "went off on my own".  For conflict of 
interest reasons, I decided that I'd give away anything I did, rather 
than trying to sell it.  This is a very "conscientious", or whatever 
word fits - thing for me to do - people say I've passed up millions $ 
in the many things I pioneered.  But, I wasn't the entrepreneur type, 
and IBM paid well enough to finance my hobby.  I'm sure it helped my 
IBM related career, i.e. outside recognition, etc.

I guess I don't remember the Ted Nelson thing fighting to get the 
"world up in arms against the computer giants".  I've seen nothing 
wrong with "computer giants" - thought I admit that when a company gets 
larger than some critical mass, it gets a "momentum" disproportionate 
to its technical abilities - allowing it to sometimes come out with 
products that would have failed if done by other companies - perhaps 
the PC Jr is such - having recently had new life breathed into it ala 
new keyboard, and significant price cuts (temporary tho they were).

The kind of practical innovation that has come out of IBM has been VERY 
fascinating.  I used to like to talk to fellow computer hobbyists about 
the printer we had that printed about as fast as you could pull paper 
out of a box; and about the 2.5 BILLION byte "boxes" of disk storage, 
etc.

I always kept my hobby separate from my job - I didn't see how I could 
enjoy the hobby if it became the same as my job, but as of Jan 1, I 
knuckled under to that, too, and am now the workstation specialist 
(means PC's and terminals) for one of the branch offices in downtown 
Chicago.  (which I really hate - being a small town "boy", the big city 
is really a pain!)  But, having bought a house at a time that interest 
rates were low, its like having a rich uncle, what with what has 
happened to interest rates.  It tends to keep me rooted in one spot.  
(I always was very conservative).

Old Q's: "you were 29 when you got into this, right?  And what 
background did you have to read TTL tech material anyway?"  Yes, 29.  
And for technical background, I had a degree in physics, and even from 
a liberal arts college, you DO learn some basic electronics.  Also of 
course remember I'd built this computer in high school, but still I was 
most certainly not one of the "jocks".  TTL just came natural to me, I 
guess because its so mathematical in nature.  Its as "simple as" 0 
volts being a "false" value, and 5 volts being a "true" value, and 
voila (or is it viola?) you could do things like and, or, exclusive or, 
not, not-and, etc - but instead of numbers on a sheet of paper, they 
were electrical signals.

History on the micro?  When did it go from switches on the front panel?  
I guess '76 or so - or whenever the apple ONE came out, and the SOL, 
which was a small machine based upon similar technology to the original 
Altair that is credited with starting it all.  But then again, my 
current CP/M machine, with 256K, 3 floppies, and 8M of hard disk, still 
has front panel switches, and LIGHTS.  I sure miss the LIGHTS on my PC 
- you can tell what its doing, how its doing, etc.

When did I first discover I could "play" with a computer?  Well, I 
guess that high school project was one.  It was purely a technical 
challenge, and learning tool - had no practical application.  Actually, 
I was motivated to spend the $$ to build it knowing I'd win first prize 
(I suppose I could be a bit less egotistical and say "hoped.."), of 
$75.  Sure enough I won, but got a hand-shake and 'gee, sorry - we 
never got out to get funds for a bond' story.  Owell.

Then, within my first year working at IBM, the first customer I worked 
with was sufficiently impressed to try to hire me away, and a whopping 
40% pay hike over what IBM paid - but I figured I'd be better in the 
long run to stay with IBM.  Right!  That company doesn't exist any 
more!.

What "clicked" to make me excited about the fact of having my own 
computer? Well, I don't remember, sorry.  I guess I just never found 
anything technically challenging enough, and realized that a computer 
would be a tool of unlimited variability that could do what I wanted it 
to do.  I guess I was just a computer junkie, even though at the time 
there weren't home machines. I remember this customer (that offered me 
the job) wasn't allowed to trust me with a key, but they approved me 
sleeping over Friday night so I could use the computer Saturday. As a 
result, they got some results they certainly didn't get out of their 
own people - because I was willing to spend so much time at it.  It 
really IS a "habit" - like a drug, etc.  Why else would I be - as I am 
now - typing at after midnight, having to get up shortly after 6:00 
tomorrow, etc.  It is just so completely unlimiting, I guess.   Today, 
I was stuck in a VERY crowded elevator for about 6 minutes. Two of the 
people were claustrophobic. I say this because somehow my interest in 
computers is as inexplicable as the claustrophobia is to them - it is 
just there.  I think because I was a loner, I never got interested in 
the more "humanitarian" things - never got interested in "partying", 
owning a boat, etc.  I HATE driving - being very law abiding, it is 
unbearable to be placed in a situation of watching everyone else break 
the law, from failing to signal, to parking in two places, to speeding, 
- sitting home at my computer is perhaps a sign of "withdrawal".  I did 
fall in love once, 1977, er, March, ah, March 2nd, ah, 8:30 PM (not 
that it made a big deal to me, heh heh).   Believe it or not "my disk 
drives rusted up" as a result of that - but sadly for the wrong reason 
-massive depression because she was a "career worman", and I just 
didn't fit in her life.  It did open my eyes to a lot of life, but also 
made me sort of "give up" - I look at it as both the best and the worst 
thing that ever happened to me.

What did I do in '55 w/hen Chuck Berry and Bill Haley revolutionized 
music? They did?  Was I building radios?  No, I didn't have the 
ambition to learn anything that complicated.  I just mixed chemicals 
together, and blew up the back yard, I guess.  (take one part 
gunpowder, bury in 1 foot deep hole; bury a wire with fine wire wrapped 
around match head in it, cover with dirt, go in house and plug other 
end in socket, go back out and apologize to neighbors cookout for 
sprinkling dirt on them..

"Get a job" was the first 45 I bought, and I didn't buy many.  Came 
from "college educated" family, with sort of "snobbish" mother - when 
we got a TV, unlike everyone else who put an antenna on the roof, she 
insisted it go in the attic so no one would know we had time for such 
frivolity.  I think they sort of turned me into a loner, too, by 
steering me toward the "children of their friends", rather than the 
local neighborhood kids, who were mostly factory workers' kids (not 
all, one friend's father was doctor, etc).

I guess it was HeathKit that got me into electronics - I built their 
16-in-one transistor experimentors kit my jr year of High School; Oh, 
also I think I subscribed to Popular Electronics.  Later to Radio 
Electronics.  You are bound to pick up some things from that, by 
osmosis if nothing else.  I was even known to buy old used computer 
boards for two bucks fifty, and literally blow-torch the chips off of 
them to make my projects.

  you might try contacting Russel Oiler at (619) 271-5610.  He is
the head of the Otrona Users Group in San Diego.  If Russel donesn't
know himself, he at least will be able to point you in the right

  I used to have a small number of them myself, but sold them to

Just a note about using wd-40. I have a friend who is a maintenance
chief for the navy at Miramar naval air station. He says that the navy
will not allow wd-40 to be used because of its corrosive actions.  I
have personaly noted some things on my watch buttons that verify the
statement. I personally use wd-40 to free up stuck things (and it does
do a good job) but then I make sure I clean and reoil the part
affected.

A computer system is only obsolete when you have progressed past it's
inherent capabilities, (i.e. Not enough memory space, not enough disk
space, processor to slow, screen to small and not expandable). In your
case it appears that you are still developing on your system and that it
is still a useful tool. Like any tool, your system becomes more useful
when it's easier or faster after an enhancement is added. In this case
(adding a rigid) you will find 2x to 10x improvement in disk bound
processing, plus the added convienence of all your files directly
accessable without swapping disks...The added enhancement of ZCPR will
make your system feel like an extension of your own thought cataloging
method. 
I have added a rigid to my XEROX 820-II and now am hardly able to stand
the use of a floppy system, in fact I got so hooked that I hacked around
the system and added another TW0 8 meg rigids to the system giving me 24
megs of online storage..A bit of over kill, but It allows me do do
anything I want in terms of segmenting my work. $1000 dollars will be
well spent to keep a friendly, familiar piece of equipment from
becomming 'obsolete', after all a computer only processes bits, it's the
human perception that makes one computer better than another...

Subject: --- ADM3a/KAYPRO II Termcaps ---
To: INFO-CPM@AMSAA.ARPA
Reply-To: MAX.HARTMAN@ames-vmsb.ARPA


The question was brought up about why the one termcap did not have
a "le" (cursor left) field?   Answer:  at the start of the entry there
is the "bs" (Back-space capability) field.  If I remember correctly, this
field is a flag, whose mere presence states "a ^H will move the cursor
backwards on this type of terminal". 

Also, the only difference on the compared ADM3a and KAYPRO entries was the
delete line (and move all other lines up) entry.   This will speed up the
use of vi if it is present, but the straight ADM3a entry will ALSO work,
just not as fast....when the application calls for deleting a line, it
will repaint the entire lower screen, instead of moving them up w/ the
screen-driver assistance.....

And finally, I think the tirade about the "ma" (cursor-key map) entry
was a little unjust....it may have been a little off, but it was probably
just typoes (those things are tedious to type if you don't know what they
mean!), and not maliciousness on his part, which was what the person doing
the yelling seemed to imply (I don't remember the names of the person who
submitted the entries, or the one who seemed so offended about them were).

If you were merely trying to point out an error (whoever you are), I
apologize for the above, but your letter DID seem a little over-vicious....

Dave Towson, et. al., thanks.  I am the originator of the ADM3a/Kaypro
termcap (or the one who POSTED it, anyway) that's been causing all of
the hoop-lah.

Perhaps the differences that were of consurn have something to do with
the fact that I provided an EMACS termcap entry, and this was being
compared and contrasted to a UNIX termcap.  I can state that I have used
this termcap on a Kaypro II with my own hands for hours on our VAX under
VAX/VMS running a Gosling EMACS.  As for the rest of the world, gee -
I dunno.  I hope it was of help, anyway.  And if you need the EMACS
termcap gobbledegook deciphered for you out there in netland, I will be
happy to provide the EMACS interpretation for you to the best of my
ability.  As to UNIX - go find a UNIX person, I'm a VAX/micro hacker.
Or a micro VAX-hacker.  Or perhaps - uh, never mind.  Best I not use
VAX, UNIX, and hacker in sentences lest I let myself in for a flame.

As to "tirades" and all of that, I am not upset - yet another flame in
netland, as I see it - and probably quite useful if you are trying to
get up on a UNIX system at that.

With respect to the cost of the hard drive, if the $895 includes the 
controller and the 8mb is formatted, then the price does not seem to be
too out-of-line, just a little high.

Regarding the question about obsolescence, I think that if you like a system
(i.e., it does almost everything you want) and don't think that you will be
replacing it anytime in the near to mid future (1 to 3 years) then it doesn't
really matter if the system is not "state-of-the-art".  If it's functional, use
it; if it ain't broke, don't fix it.

Richard (Secrist) offered to explain the EMACS termcap "gobbledegook"
and I'd like to take him up on that offer....I am only familiar w/ UNIX
termcap gobbledegook, and that not very recently (I have been working on
RSX-11m/VMS/RT-11/etc.... systems for the paste 2-3 years....  Just what
is the meaning of the infamous "ma" field, that was misteaken (or was it?)
for a keypad "map" definition??  And what about the rest of the stuff...to
be honest, I read that it was an "EMACS termcap entry"...but it just didn't\
hit that it would be all that different from a UNIX termcap entry......care
to elucidate on the differences??

Subject: Re: Continuing Saga of the ADM3a/Kaypro Termcap

Some of you may have noticed differences in the padding number for
"cl", eg. :cl=3^Z:, cl=1^Z . I suspect that some of the problems
I have observed with the Kaypro 2x at higher port speeds (eg. 1200,
9600 baud) are related to needs for the microcomputer to do some work
each time it receives a new-line (linefeed) and/or return (CR)
character from a remote system.  Depending on the port speed and the
amount of cpu processing required by the communication program on
the Kaypro, it may be necessary to increase the padding on "cl"
(clear screen), and set or increase "dC" (number of milisec of
cr delay needed) and "dN" (number of milisec of nl delay needed).

Of course, adding padding and end of line delays to the termcap
may not be the whole solution.  Lack of data line flow control
(eg. XOFF/XON) can easily bring most communications programs to a
halt at higher speeds (by overflowing I/O buffers). In addition,
many communication and file transfer program assume a quick
response to transmission from the remote machine. That is, the
program will time out when the required response is delayed,
for example, by an overloaded time sharing system.

Jim,

  you might try contacting Russel Oiler at (619) 271-5610.  He is
the head of the Otrona Users Group in San Diego.  If Russel donesn't
know himself, he at least will be able to point you in the right
direction.  

  I used to have a small number of them myself, but sold them to 
others like you (I kept an 8/16, though).

Jack,

   As far as I have been able to determine, the Kaypro is compatible
with an ADM3 (or 3a).  I think this is for Kaypro 2, but I am not sure.
Try setting the term type to ADM3a, which SHOULD be in the /etc/termcap
file in most systems.  If it works, you could always add the special
function (keypad) keys yourself (I don't remember if they generate
special codes or just the ASCII numbers.....)
 
   If anyone else has any more information......

Jim Moore (aside from asking about where to buy an Otrona, which
someone else responded to) asked about what happens to the inventory
of a company that folds.   I would assume that it gets sold off,
at least that is what happened to some of the old Atari inventory
recently (although Atari just sort of turned over, rather than folding).
A local electronics store bought up a lot of their old stock, and I
got a 300-baud acoustic modem (Atari 830) for $7.50!  Places like DAK
probably watch out for things like this too, they bought up all of the
Olivetti Ink-jet printers, and sold them for $199 each, after control
of Olivetti was turned over to a company that was not interested in
maintaining that product.  (The above "aquisition" is un-verified, and
mentioned AS REMEMBERED from reading the DAK advertisement for the 
printer in question...I do NOT want to start any un-founded rumors
about Olivetti! -rmh)  Keep an eye out for bargains such as those 
mentioned above when a company runs into problems!  (I would not
normally consider buying a 300-baud modem, I was waiting for the
prices on the 1200's to come down after the introduction of the
2400's......but for that price I can even put up w/ the problems
of an acoustic modem.....)

The following is the entry from our site's EMACS termcap file (under VAX/VMS)

except for the last entry "dl=\ER:".

"dl=" is for the "delete current line" function, which moves all lines below
it up by one.  The "\ER:" means escape-R, with the '\' and ':' being
delimiters.

NetLandians,

I'm busily collecting various Random Number Generators (RNGs for now).
One friend on the net pointed me at Prof. Arne Thesen, an engineer at
Univ of Wisconsin-Madison.  The kind professor mailed me several of his most
interesting papers, and I'm busily trying to understand them.

One hack of one of his algorithms is in my directory, ABN.ISCAMS@USC-ISID,
available via Anonymous FTP.  TurboPascal, demo version only, using the
Tausworthe Algorithm.  Nice code.  Other techniques will be available, plus
a full copy of his most pertinent two papers, as I get the time.

Professor Thesen kindly placed his work in the Public Domain, with the
condition that credits remain with the code/articles.

Regards,
David Kirschbaum
Toad Hall
(ABN.ISCAMS@USC-ISID)
P.S.: excuse the Pascal hack - I'm only a novice in the language.

Subject:  Re:  Kaypro Termcap Entry - Comparison with ADM-3A

Richard et al - The string "ma=...etc" in the termcaps you posted for the
ADM-3A and kaypro appears to be in error.  The "ma" string is an "arrow-key
map" for use with the screen editor "vi", version 2 only.  This string is
now essentially obsolete.  Nevertheless, the string you posted "j^Jk^P^K^Pl"
appears to have two problems: it contains a printing character "j" as the
first character, and the field-separator ":" is missing from the end.  It
seems that having a printing character as the first character issued by an
arrow key would be extremely confusing, since it could not be distinguished
from the same character in text until a following key or keys had been
examined.  This would cause that particular printing character not to be
echoed to the screen until the following character or characters had been
entered.  The ADM-3A termcap entry for our local UNIX machines gives just
"^K^P" for the "ma" string.  This is, I admit, a minor point since the "ma"
string will be rarely (if ever) used.  A more significant apparent error is
in the string "cs=...etc".  Our local UNIX documentation has this string
being used to change the scrolling region, which is quite different from
"clear-to-end-of-display" ("cd"), which seems to have been the intent.

     Of possibly more interest is the following termcap for the Kaypro-II,
taken from our local "/etc/termcap" file.

# KayPro II from Richard G Turner <rturner at Darcom-Hq.ARPA>
# I've found that my KayPro II, running MDM730, continues to emulate an
# ADM-3A terminal, just like I was running TERM.COM. On our 4.2 UNIX
# system the following termcap entry works well:
# I have noticed a couple of minor glitches, but nothing I can't work
# around.
k2|kaypro|KayPro II:\
	:am:bs:li#24:co#80:\
	:cm=\E=%+ %+ :\
	:ho=^^:cl=1^Z:\
	:nd=^L:up=^K:do=^J:\
	:ce=^X:cd=^W:\
	:al=\EE:dl=\ER:

I have no personal experience with this termcap, and I don't know why there
are strings for moving the cursor right, up and down ("nd", "up" and "do"
respectively), but not one to move the cursor left ("le").  But the added
string "al" (add line) is particularly desirable for use with screen editors
via low-speed communications, as it allows local re-writing of a substantial
portion of the screen, and you don't have to wait for this re-writing to be
done at low speed from the remote machine.  Perhaps Richard Turner, the author
(who receives info-cpm), will comment on the missing "le" string, and also
on whether his shorter (one millisecond versus three) delay for the clear-
screen ("cl") string has caused any problems.

     General note:  Termcaps seem awfully cryptic and confusing at first
encounter, but they are really not difficult to comprehend PROVIDED you have
a good set of instructions.  I will be happy to send such a set of instructions
to anyone who wants it.  But please send requests to me, and not to the whole
list unless absolutely necessary.

I'll look around and see if I can determine who sent it, but I'm afraid the

Subj: DateStamper for CP/M 2.2 is ready


DateStamper(tm) --  a CP/M 2.2 system extension for automatic time-and
-date-stamping of files -- has passed its beta-tests, thanks to skillful and
persistent assistance from Dave Birnbaum, Hal Bower, Bob Clements,
Jack Bicer, Paul Kelley, Kim Korner, Neil Maron, Dick Mead, Mike Niswonger,
Ed Park, and John Shaver.

This announcement summarizes how DateStamper works, its major features,
companion utilities, and availability.

		--------------------------------------

			    DateStamper(tm)

  A CP/M 2.2 system extension for automatic time-and-date-stamping of files.


			 >>>  HOW IT WORKS  <<<

Disks prepared for DateStamping store the created, modified, and accessed
dates for each directory entry in a special file, which is the first-
allocated file on the disk and also the first entry in the directory.

The command to load DateStamper may be placed in the user's command
processor buffer to allow automatic loading at each cold boot; or,
DateStamper can be loaded manually with a transient command.  DateStamper
then patches into the BIOS and BDOS, and monitors BDOS calls until cold-boot
or power-down.  It keeps track of writes, and updates the time-and-date file
on creates, opens, and closes, using BIOS file i/o.

The clock-reading routine is externally callable at an offset available at a
BDOS patch.  It returns packed BCD date and time to the caller's buffer.


			>>>  MAJOR FEATURES  <<<

Function       ..  Stamps every file's create, access and modify time and date
		   with imperceptible overhead.

Hardware       ..  Clock NOT REQUIRED.  Default mode uses a "relative"
		   counter clock that increments on each file access.
	       ..  Use any hardware or terminal real-time clock to stamp
		   actual time.  Pre-assembled routines for popular clocks,
		   plus custom ASM option.

Compatibility  ..  Works with all programs adhering to CP/M 2.2 interfacing
                   standards.
	       ..  Runs with replacement CCP's such as ZCPRx
	       ..  Requires standard CP/M 2.2 BDOS.
	       ..  Disks and files are fully compatible with standard CP/M 80
		   and CP/M 86 format (but not CP/M 86 timestamp).  Intermix
		   regular and DateStamper-prepared disks.

Resource use   ..  Uses less than 1K memory.  Loads below the CCP (default
		   case) or above the BIOS.
	       ..  Uses 1 directory entry plus 1 small file per disk.

Accessibility  ..  Portable, machine-independent entrypoint for reading date
		   and time.
	       ..  File times and dates available to applications programs.


		     >>>  PRINCIPAL  UTILITIES  <<<

SDD	       ..  SuperDirectory enhanced to show create, access, modify
		   time and date in selectable formats and to support
		   PUBlic filetype.

DATSWEEP       ..  A compleat 6-window file-maintenance utility.  Select and
		   tag files by wildcard, attribute bit, and date-time
		   relational operators for copy/rename/erase/change-date/
		   change-user-number operations.  View mode is bidirectional
		   with horizontal scrolling and string-search (forward-only
		   for squeezed files).

LOG,TOTALLOG   ..  Log time-stamped category of computer use.  Show monthly
		   summary by category.

DATE	       ..  Display current date and time.


		    >>>  INSTALLATION UTILITIES  <<< 

..	Prepare a disk with time-and-date file.  Run once for each disk.
..	Set date and relative time, when required.
..	Configure utilities for terminal-specific video sequences.
..	Set default modes for utilities.
..	Customize DateStamper for system addresses, real-time clock, and
	auto-execute command line.


		     >>>  COMPANION UTILITIES  <<<

	The DateStamper toolkit disk(s) will contain additional utilities
with source code, including user contributions.  They currently comprise:

MAKE  	   ..	Create submit script from a makefile of file dependencies
		based on last-modified date (a la unix) -- by Neil Maron.
MCAT,XCAT  ..	Catalog and cross-reference disks with file dates --
		by Hal Bower.
APPEND	   ..	Concatenate text files with filename/datestamp separator.
SAP51	   ..	New version of SAP (sort and pack directory) that supports
		the DateStamper time and date file; with other improvements.
DSLIB	   ..	8080 ASM library of routines to read clock and return file
		time and date, callable from BDS-C.


			 >>>  AVAILABILITY  <<<

Plu*Perfect Systems is sending information brochures and taking orders;
shipments will go out as soon as the manual comes back from the printer --

Is Intertec, the maker of Superbrains still around? I remember them producing
a network and PC compatibles at some point.

I have a 64K ATR8000 CP/M 80 machine, and someone has just come
out with a hard disk drive for it.  The drive can store 8 Mb, and 
costs $895.00  .  That is almost as much as the cost of the computer
and two 5.25" floppy drives, and I'm wondering if it is worth putting
in all that money for the hard disk.  Never having used one before, I
have no basis for judgement.  I'm pretty happy with the system itself,
I run a fair bit of stuff on it (Wordstar, Turbo and C, terminal emulation
and so on), and I'm trying to get ZCPR3 cranked up on it.  But I have
been asked if I can justify spending another $1000 on a system that appears
to be obsolete, and I'm finding it hard to say very much.  I would
appreciate comments from any of you 'out there in netland'.
Is it convinient enough to be worth the cost?  Is it worth investing
in this system?   Everything will be appreciated.  Thanks,

Does anybody on this net have the specs for the algorithm used to squeeze
(or more importantly, unsqueeze) things on SIMTEL20?
Better yet, if there is a C program to do the unsqueezing, could somebody
post it, or mail it to me.  PLEASE!

If somebody will mail me the English description of the algorithm, I will
write a C program to do it and post it to net.sources.

I have a copy of both sq.c and usq.c which I find to be compatible with the
CP/M utilities I use. I got them off a BBS somewhere, and fixed them. I use
them a good deal for squeezing files to be transferred between our VAX at 
work and my CP/M machine at home. At 300 baud, I need all the help I can get!

These utilities appear to have come from the net originally. I haven't been on
long, so I wouldn't really know. If there is interest, I will post them to
net.sources.

A Word of Warning: I sent these utilities to several other CP/M users in the
area (on the net). One (and only one) reported that he was unable to unsqueeze
files that he squeezed on his system at home! Something caused usq to crash
with a core dump. We have not found the problem, but it only occurs with files
squeezed by his particular squeeze program! The rest of us have never had a 
problem with the utilities.

Fellow CP/Mers - For nearly two months, the machine from which info-cpm is
distributed has been having hardware problems.  These have been sporadic in
nature, with frequent crashes at times, and then "quiet periods" during which
the machine stayed up for several days.  Things now seem to be building to
some sort of climax.  So far today, the machine has crashed at least eight
times.  With luck, the thing will go down and stay dead so that DEC maintenance
can find the problem.  Without luck, we may limp along for weeks.

     It is possible that mail processing will be noticeably slowed by these
frequent crashes.  Please be patient if info-cpm traffic becomes erratic.
Those of us who are homed on this machine are just as unhappy about the
situation as you are.

be immediately accepted by whichever local machine is currently answering
to the net address "brl", and further delivery to amsaa will become our
local affair.  Such deliveries are attempted at ten-minute intervals.

I made the mistake last February of thinking that I could 
place a mail order for a floppy disk drive and receive 
the new drive in a reasonable time. I looked in various
magazines for the best price and finaly placed an order
with P1E for:

            1 Mitsubishi 8" disk drive,
            1 box of diskettes, and
            1 30"/60" cable

After waiting a few weeks for the drive to be stocked, I
received:

            1 dual 8" disk drive cabinet w/power supply,
            1 30"/30" cable, and
            1 invoice that listed correctly my original order

I called P1E and was informed that they would ship me the
correct order only after I returned the incorrect items. On
my original order I included $9.50 for shipping and handling.
When I shipped the incorrect order back to P1E the shipping
cost me $11.50 since the cabinet was heavier than my original
order. When I asked the service people about getting my
money back, they said that I would have to eat the cost for
their mistake. 

The final twist of this whole mess is that they have confirmed
that they received my order on 4/9/85 but as of today no 
shipment back to me has been made. 

One thing that has saved me money on this whole mess is that
you do not have to use the long distance number to get P1E.
I have been able to use the 800 number and have them connect
me to customer service. If it wasn't for that I think my
phone bill would be larger than my original order.

This has been my third order (and last) with P1E and they
are batting 3 for 3. In the future I will pay the higher
east coast prices just to be able to get my hands on
the vendor when things go wrong.

Bill (et al),

Can't find my listing of the SIGM volumes at SIMTEL20 ANYWHERE!  But anyway...

Our friends at Universidad de Pueblo in Mexico City disassembled the 8080
version of SQ and USQ from its binary .COM file (as a student exercise, I
understand), and rewrote it like humans would in Assembler.

Carved a whole BUNCH of waste out of it, reduced its compiled form signifi-
cantly, and also increased its speed.

The kid went through THEIR source code, stuck in a bunch of Z80 stuff (and
tightened up the code a little more), and it still works!

However, for a nice, documented (yep, in English) source code for SQ and
USQ squeeze programs, to include a nice library where you can use the SQ
and USQ algorithms as part of a byte stream in about ANYTHING...

It's in one of the volumes (above 170, as I recollect) in the SIGM archives
at SIMTEL20, identified (as several volumes are) by the Univ. de
Pueblo name and a bunch of SQ/USQ files.  Have fun!  I sure did!

Oh, yeah,

Almost forgot, re the algorithm for SQ/USQ.

Forget where I found it (on this net?), but some persevering soul did an USQ
in BASIC for the PC that nicely shows the algorithm if you can read BASIC.
(They are the first to admit it runs slowly uncompiled, and barely tolerably
compiled.)

If no one else remembers where this came from, I can upload to the requesting
party or put it available via Anonymous FTP in my directory.  Just yell.

Donno if the rascal actually works (didn't bother to try), but the code looks
sound as I recollect from my work with the .ASM and .ZSM versions I played with.
