From: Michal Young <young@uci-icsc.ARPA>

Micro Cornucopia sells three varieties of Kaypro schematics, for $20 each,
with a theory-of-operation keyed to schematic.
	-  Kaypro II & 4 (pre-84)
	-  Kaypro 10 (without modem)
	-  Kaypro 2, 4, 10 (84 series)
Schematics are on a single 24" by 36" sheet.  They include serial and
parallel port details and programming examples, and other nitty-gritty
details that is hard to find elsewhere (e.g., how the Kaypro II bios
switches between video and main ram banks). I have both the Micro-C
schematic for Kaypro II, and a bootleg copy of the dealer's manual and
schematic.  The Micro-C version is a lot better than what Kaypro provides
dealers.  

Address:	Micro Cornucopia
		P.O. Box 223
		Bend, Oregon  97709

Phone:		(503) 382-5060  (9am to 5pm, PST)

They take Visa and Mastercard, and prices include postage.
I've ordered from them by phone, and got good fast service.  They also have
a technical help hot-line, the number of which I don't want to broadcast to
the net, but you'll find out about it if you decide to buy a schematic from 
them.  I've called the technical hotline and gotten good help on tracking
down a hardware problem. In summary, this organization is a good resource to
people with Kaypros (also Big Board homebrew systems, and Xerox 820 series.)

I have no connection with Micro C, other than as a satisfied subscriber and
customer.

Subject: List of best public domain CP/M programs

Norm Gregory, SysOp of Seattle's "Downspout" Z-Node, provides this
list of best public domain software for the CP/M user.  This list is
updated monthly.  It is presented here for your information and does
NOT in any way indicate that ALL these files are available from
SIMTEL20, my RCP/M, or GEnie's CP/M RoundTable.  However, many are
available from these sources.

PD:<CPM>CPM.CRCLST on SIMTEL20 (the file listing all the filenames,
sizes and CRCs of the PD:<CPM.xx> directories) has been updated as
of today.

SEPBEST2.LST is a revised version of SEPTBEST.LST to correct for duplicate
entries, bad alphabetical sort, and incorrect end-of-file.  No entries have
been altered.  -- Keith Petersen, W8SDZ -- 9/1/86 0938 edt.

----
ACMDU11.LBR - ZCPR3
   Allows you to add, delete and view aliases in an ALIAS.CMD file without a
   word processor.  ACMDUTIL was written for those of us who write aliases on
   the fly.  V1.1 now searches BASE: rather than ROOT: for the ALIAS.CMD file
   and takes an optional DU: on the command line to find any copy of ALIAS.CMD.

-----
ACREATE3.LBR
   ACREATE now searches A0: and A15: and DCREATE extracts the command
   line from an alias file and puts it in a text file for editing.
   That's right,  ACREATE3.COM creates a ZCPR3 ALIAS file from a standard
   text file.  And DCREATE.COM will create a text file from an ALIAS file.
   The system works well and is fast.		(01:52:31 AM  Jul 14, 1985)

----
ADIS.LBR - CP/M
  Matt Wing's Z80 and 8080 disasembler.

----
ALIAS#1.LBR - Z3
   The Echelon ZCPR3 newsletters frequently contain sample Alias scripts....
   this library contains almost all those which have been published to date,
   plus a few to come in future newsletters.

----
ARCDIR.LBR - CP/M
   A utlity to allow CP/M80 users to do a directory of PC/DOS ARC files.
   A must for BBS systems.		[ 06:45:01 AM  Nov 21, 1985 ]

----
ARUNZ09.LBR - ZCPR3
   ARUNZ now has MENU/VMENU-style user prompts (but better!) and parameters
   that read Z3 registers and memory locations.  If you run a Z3 system and
   do not use ARUNZ you are missing what is perhaps the best of all Z3
   utilities.  Store all your alias scripts in one little ASCII text file.

----
ASCII.LBR - CP/M
   ASCII.COM is for folks with poor memories. Just type in ASCII<CR> and
   press any key.  The key and it's HEX code is displayed.  ^C to end the
   program and warm boot the system.		[ 12:21:13 AM  Dec 07, 1985 ]

----
AUTOZINS.CCP
   Notes on modifing your copy of ZCPR3 ccp to "autoinstall" all ZCPR3
   utilities.  Erase ZINS - you won't need it any more.  No more hassles
   with downloading ZCPR3 programs and forgetting to install them.

----
B-COMPIL.LBR - CP/M
  This is BCBC, CP/M VERSION 1.1, written by Bruce Tonkin.  It's a BASIC

   Finally a BYE5 insert for the Commodore C128 to be used with BYE510 or
   newer.  Thanks to George Peace.

----
BBCAT10.LBR
   BBCAT is a catalog program integrated with the archive/dater/backup
   utility BBACK (v6.0) to provide a convenient way of keeping track of
   backed-up files and of eliminating duplicates.  Unlike NCAT, UCAT et
   al, which are meant chiefly for the floppy-disk user, BBCAT is de-
   signed primarily for those with hard disks who only use floppies for
   back-up and storage.

----
BD03.LBR - CP/M
   Irv Hoff's update to his fine bad sector lockout program.  This one
   reports the file names that have bad sectors, which is what you
   really want to know.

----
BISHOW32.LBR - CP/M
   BISHOW32 reads just about any text file, whether or not it is squeezed
   or enclosed in a library. It allows you to move forward and back in
   the file by a page or a line at a time. You can scroll horizontally
   in a file wider than the screen. You can jump back to the top of the
   file. It uses Wordstar cursor keys, as well as alternates. Fits in 2k

----
BRADFORD.LBR - CP/M
   Aaron Contorer's Near Letter Quality printer program for Epson and Gemini
   printers.  A commercial package that Aaron is now distributing as Freeware.
   If you use it, send Aaron $15 and he will send you his manual, which tells
   you about advanced features.

----
BU14.LBR - CP/M
   Hard disk back-up, special printer versions in .LBR

----
BWFMT.LBR - CP/M
   This is for BONDWELL computers, 12 and 12A for sure (maybe 14 &16).
   These allow formatting disks for Osborne and Kaypro computers.

----
BYE510.LBR - RCPM/BBS
   BYE5 is the program most RCP/M systems use (for CP/M 2 and CP/M 3) to
   interface their computer and modem to their local BBS system.  This
   version adds the SYSLOG option which captures all input from the remote
   user.  Other improvements...read BYE5.HQS in the .LBR.

----
CHEFREC.5Q - CP/M
   More recipes for Chef.com.

----
CHOP.LBR - CP/M
   CHOP is a little CP/M program written in Turbo Pascal to copy a large
   text file into a number of consecutive smaller ones which are easier
   to handle and edit.	The new files have numbered extensions (file
   types).  The file will be divided into pieces, each having 128 lines.
   These can be edited and then re-combined with PIP.  Program is very
   slow and files are quite small, typically 5-8k each (depends on the
   average line length).

----
CRUNCH12.LBR - CP/M
   File compression utilities for "squeezing" files using the same
   algorithms as the MSDOS ARC program. Source code included.

----
DASM16.LBR - CP/M
   This is Rick Conn's DASM15 now including an include file for
   Hitachi HD64180 mnemonics.	   [ 03:10:00 PM  Oct 26, 1985 ]

----
DBL4.LBR - CP/M
   Update of the DBL program for printing two pages on one page with an Epson
   printer in compressed mode.		    [ 04:20:52 AM  Nov 19, 1985 ]

----
DBUG10.LBR - CP/M
   An internal debugger for Turbo Pascal programs; sort of a DDT tool. It adds
   about 600 lines of code in an include file.	[ 02:55:24 AM  Dec 28, 1985 ]

----
DEARC2.LBR - CP/M
   Allows a CP/M user to access those 16 bit .ARC files that you see
   everywhere.	The program uses two different decompression algorithyms,
   the Greenlaw and LZW, depending on the method used to compress initially.

----
DEBUGRCP.AQM - ZCPR3
   ZCPR3 Debug facility (same as MU31) in a Resident Command Package.

----
DIR1ST31.LBR - CP/M
  DIRFIRST:  Z-80 sorted directory showing first line(s) of files.
  Latest in the DIRFIRST series (v 3.1).

----
DIRR7.LBR - CP/M
   Directory file, alphabetizes vertically in an unique manner generally
   considered to be superior to that of "SD".  Type '?' for a help guide
   to see the various options available.  In extended mode, shows system
   files, R/O and archived files with special characters, making use of
   reverse video, lower case, etc. superfluous.  Can also make hard-copy
   or a disk file including those attributes.  Has several unusual fea-
   tures you will immediately like.  Fixed the 'A' option this version.
		       [ 11:36:24 PM  Dec 11, 1985 ]

----
DIRSIZE.LBR - CP/M
   Utility program for disk directory file count. [ 02:33:31 AM  Apr 24, 1986 ]

----
DU312.LBR - Z3
     Newest version of DiskUtility from Z-NODE Central.

----
DZ-APR86.LBR - CP/M
   John Washington's latest update to his DazzleStar.  It does NOT
   replace DZ-FEB86.LBR.  It is a supplement, principally advising
   of a few fixes.

----
DZ-FEB86.LBR - CP/M
   This is latest version of DAZLSTAR, an interactive Z80 disassembler
   New version has comprehensive install program, "side-line" comments,
   active cursor indicator in both ascii and hex fields, and greatly
   improved menus.  Extremely flexible.  If you do any disassembly, you
   need this one.			[ 04:54:14 AM  Apr 06, 1986 ]

----
EPRO.LBR - CP/M
   E-Prolog is a public domain prolog interpreter for Z-80 computers.
   The .LBR file contains the interpreter, a library of logical predi-
   cates (AND, OR, etc.), some sample databases, assembly language
   source modules, documentation, and some other things.  E-Prolog is
   a minimal prolog, but it works for constructing databases and
   inference rules within them.  Its main lack is that it won't do
   even integer arithmetic.  It will do disk I/O.

----
EXPRESS1.LBR - CP/M
   A very fast full screen text editor. EXPRESS v1.0: 1) includes a
   built in macro key translator and editor; 2) can be installed on any
   CP/M 2.2 system with at least 48k of memory and a terminal with direct
   cursor addressing; 3) is not a word processor; 4) is a preliminary and
   limited implementation, distributed without charge, to introduce users
   to the potential of the EXPRESS full screen editor from Cecil and Laine
   Stump of Woodinville, Washington.	     [ 02:51:25 AM  Sep 28, 1985 ]

----
FANFOLD5.LBR - CP/M
   "Universal" version of Ron Rock's (Chicago) FANFOLD. For those with Turbo-
   Pascal a small RUN.PAS file chains to FANFOLD.CHN with printer codes
   supplied by user. START address 2100; END address CB10.

----
FASTMX80.MOD - CP/M
   Speedup for Epson MX-80 Printers!!	       [ 06:16:51 AM  May 29, 1986 ]

----
FATCAT24.CHG - FATCAT
   Locations in FATCAT24 to change the "|" delimiter to something your
   printer can print i.e. a ":".

----
FATCAT24.LBR - CP/M
   Steve Cohen's (Chicago) update of his marvelous catalog program stamps out
   bugs in version 2.3 and adds some goodies such as a print to file routine.
   If you came to the party late FATCAT is the super-duper-disk cataloguer
   featuring rapid-fire disk insertion, with tedious catalog updating taking
   place after all disks entered; also library file support and a
   screen-oriented "Cleanup" mode in which files can be erased or renamed
   before being catalogued, and also disk-name files can be added in
   this mode.

----
FBAD60.LBR - CP/M
   Finds and locks out bad sectors on a CP/M-80 disk.  Finally it will
   now run under CP/M Plus as well using included RSX.	Instructions
   on how to implement version for CPM Plus are included.

----
FILT7A.LBR - CP/M
   A multi-purpose filter program for text files, WordStar files or as-
   sembly level source code files.  Menu-selection.  Removes all tabs or
   optionally puts tabs at all optimum locations.  This version checks
   for space breaks and soft-hyphens before looking for unwanted control
   characters.	Very fast, when done shows a summary of what it found.
   7k, 54 records.

----
FINREP22.LBR - CP/M
   Eric Gans' (French Department, UCLA, Los Angeles, CA) FINd and REPlace
   V2.2 which adds "V" flag to allow user verification ("Replace  (y/n)?")
   before replacement in text files. FINREP is a search/replace program that
   remedies most of the deficiencies of Wordstar's ^QA and other similar
   commands.  Aside from being faster, it has important additional features:
     - allows wildcards in search string (v2.0)
     - allows wildcard filename (find/replace in groups of files)
     - command-line entry allows batch processing by SUBMIT, etc.
     - allows entry of control or hex characters (0-FF)
     - can be used with object files (e.g., COM files)
     - sets  capitalization (first letter or whole word) and high
       bit of the last character according to the old string
   This last feature means that,  for example,	if you are writing a
   scenario where the characters' names appear sometimes in CAPS and
   sometimes just Capitalized, you don't need two search/replaces to
   replace one name with another: JOE will be replaced by HARRY, Joe
   by Harry, and even joe by harry.

----
FRONT50.LBR - CP/M
   Latest update of FRONT, a program that replaces the usual CPM A>
   prompt with a menu.

----
FT.LBR - CP/M
   A quick, dirty, and tiny text file creator.	Type FT FILENAME.EXT and start
   typing.  Two <CR>'s closes and saves file.  [ 03:50:10 AM  Oct 25, 1985 ]

----
FU-12.LBR - CP/M
  File Utility is a full screen binary file editor.  Cursor functions pretty
  much follow WS commands.  Also includes a windowed full function calculator
  for binary, hex, and decimal interger.   And takes up less memory than
  PATCH, which is great for use small TPAers.	Great hacking tool!!!

----
FUNKY12.LBR - CP/M
  Allows you to program your terminal's function keys, either interactively
  or from a disk file.	This version includes the ability to embed control
  characters and escape sequences.

----
GKEY2.LBR - CP/M
   Gans' key enhancer generalized for all CP/M machines (2.2 at least).
   Smaller than SMARTKEY, allows redefinition of ESCAPE sequences.
   use a little beta-testing on machines other than the Kaypro.

----
GTXT11.LBR
   Makes a text file into a .COM file. V1.1 update:
	- exit via ^C.
	- zeroes high bit to read (say) WS doc mode files
	- allows printing of control characters using "^" (thus ^Z entered in
	  the text will blank the screen when the COM file is run.)
	- page breaks can be forced with "~"  However, a "[More]" is issued
	  every 23 lines without you having to add "~" to the text;  when you
	  type a character the [More] is blanked out and doesn't waste a line
	  on the screen.			(12:40:38 AM  Jun 25, 1985)

----
HELP53.OBJ
   HELP is version 5.3 of HELP for ZCPR3.  The version adds automatic
   unsqueeze, so when you issue a command like "HELP topic", HELP
   will search for topic.HLP or topic.HQP along the path and in the
   HELP: directory, and, when found, will load and unsqueeze as
   necessary.  The tradeoff is space vs speed - squeezed files take
   less space but more time to unsqueeze during the load.  Once loaded,
   there is no difference in processing HLP/HQP until next load.

----
HIPPO11C.LBR - CP/M
   Vastly improved release of Happy Investor's (tm) Personal Portfolio
   Organizer.  Bugs fixed, more convenience, and capacity expanded to
   5 securities and 10 purchases in this free version of HIPPO (tm).

----
HSH15.LBR - ZCPR3
   History SHell.  Allows recall and editing of previous command lines.
   Version 1.5 corrects a serious bug in handling entry of long command
   lines and allows installation of the prompt string.

----
IMP244.LBR - CP/M
   Modem program that has 1k protocol, automatic step-down for 2400 bps
   modems and KMD-batch mode as well as MODEM7 batch.  This version
   changes the batch header block to work with KMD - stores the file
   length as two hex bytes at the end of the block.  Can now handle
   files up to 8.2 megabytes, while showing additional information.
   Also supports the Anchor Mark XII for autodial and is easier to use
   in terminal mode with Osborne OS-1 computers.  Other changes.

----
IMP-OVL.LBR - CP/M
   Overlays for the IMP modem program, dated 27 Oct 85.  See IMP-OVL.LST
   for a list of those avaiable in this library. [ 02:49:05 AM	Oct 30, 1985 ]

----
IMPATCH.LBR - CP/M
   IMPATCH is a menu-driven program for patching of IMP244 default
   parameters.	Options include either directly patching your version
   of IMP or writing a new version of IMP containing the changes.  The
   LBR file contains a DOC file with patch points explained.

----
INDEX85.LBR
   INDEX85 reworking by David Cortesi (Dr. Dobbs, "Inside CP/M," etc.)
   of his earlier indexing program.  This version (no new features,
   but also no bugs) is now in Turbo-pascal, and is quite elegant.  Also
   very useful for indexing any sort of published or just printed document.
   It's provided in compiled form for CP/M 80 systems (including a 48k
   version for us Z-system users), but may be recompiled for MS/DOS,
   probably without code changes.

----
INDOTCOM.ZQX - ZCPR3
   This .zex file will install your default RCP, FCP, NDR, PATH, and
   WHEEL specifications right into Z3DOTCOM so you don't have to
   load them each time you boot up unless you change them on the fly.

----
K83ZCPR3.LBR
   Full implementation of ZCPR3 for older Kaypro II's and IV's (pre-1984
   machines without video/graphics enhancements).  Fully compatible with
   the "standard" John Smith implementations for the Kaypro 10 and 484.
   Gives the user full utility interchangeability without reinstallation
   with ZCPR3 files (except SYS.ENV) used on Kaypro 10's and 484's. Uses
   all the Smith implementation addresses.

----
K83Z3UPD.LBR
   This is a library file which updates the K83ZCPR3.LBR.  It contains
   an updated bios image, the ASM file used to modify bios images, both
   of which focus on fixing the LISTST bug in the KAYPRO rom.  It also
   contains an alias program which alters one byte in any other alias
   program so that it can be used as a STARTUP.COM on a 58k TPA Kaypro
   ZCPR3 system and a .DOC file.       [ 04:05:03 AM  Jan 23, 1986 ]

----
KISOR.ART - Other
   Henry Kisor computer column no longer appears in The Seattle Times.
   This is copy of his last piece.

----
KMD.HQP - CP/M
   Help file telling how to transfer files with KMD.  Beneficial for new
   CP/M users who are unfamiliar with file transfer protocols.	Will
   hopefully save SYSOPs a lot of time trying to answer individual
   questions.  Even the experienced CP/M user might find the information
   of interest/value.  There are perhaps functions available some users
   are not aware exist and might find useful to their normal operation.

----
KMD22.LBR - GENERAL CP/M
   KMD is used by most RCPM systems for handling file transfers to/from
   the remote user.  This version uses Bob Freed's routines which allow
   downloading member files from an .ARC archive library.  It also uses
   a concept similar to that used for IMP, MDM7 and MEX permitting easy
   and rapid installation, via a master overlay merged with the object
   code file.  This permits a modest sized library.  33k, 259 records.

----
LABELG10.LBR
   LABELG10.LBR is a Turbo Pascal file that can be used to create
   Multiple Labels, store label information to disk, write to list
   Disk Labels, and finally act as a MailMerge-type creator of a form
   letter and the appropriate address label file.  A COM file is
   included that will run on any CP/M-type system.  All source files
   are also included.

------
LASM3.LBR
  This is an enhanced version of Pete Mack's LASM assembler which was it-
  self an improved version of Ward Christenson's LINKASM assembler.  All
  of the Z80 op codes have been added in the style of the 8080.  Also
  the symbol cross reference (requested by the XREF directive) will now
  be printed on the console if the normal listing has been directed there
  (the previous version only generated the XREF listing if the normal
  listing was directed to a .PRN file).

----
LRUN23.LBR
   Slight improvement over the already-good LRUN22.  Program now shows
   the bad command, with an LRUNZ-style error display, if it's not in
   the default or selected LBR. 	(03:09:56 AM  Jul 11, 1985)

----
LSTOOL11.LBR - CP/M
  Jim Gronek's utility program designed to extend the usefulness of the
  MCAT/XCAT or LCAT/XLCAT Disk Cataloging System.  LST-TOOL can read the
  .LST files produced by XCAT/XLCAT and report useful information on them
  back to you.	 V1.1 utilizes a technique to automatically determine
  available memory at run-time.

----
LUZ3.LBR
   ZCPR3 library tools.  LGET to extract and optionally unsqueeze files
   from a library, LLF to display files in a library, LX to run files from
   a library, LHELP to process HLP/HQP files in a library.  From Rick Conn.

----
M80VMN.DOC - ZCPR3
   Examples of what can be done with Z3's MENU, accessing editor, assembler,
   debugger, help system for writing programs with syslib.  Sure
   beats the L80 command line.		 [ 06:00:55 AM	Nov 09, 1985 ]

----
MACPRINT.LBR - CP/M
   Public domain fancy printing program that really does enhance Epson
   compatibles!  --  Triple height, "MAC" style characters from a
   standard ASCII text file or the keyboard, runs under CP/M, and as
   the signon warns, don't hold your breath if you're running it on
   floppies!

----
MAKBATCH.LBR - CP/M
   Fast, easy way to create and execute submit-like commands, without
   submit.com or the need for an editor.  Instead of a secondary .sub
   file you get a primary .com file, ready to go. [ 06:11:25 AM  Oct 16, 1985 ]

----
MBINDX.LBR
  This program produces an index of the variables and reserved words used in
  a MBASIC program file.  The file to be indexed MUST be saved in the 'A'
  (=ASCII) mode.

----
MEMCOM.LBR
  These programs establish a virtual "ram disk", drive "E:", of various sizes,
  using space from TPA.  All that one must do is execute one of the MEMx.COM
  programs within this .LBR and a virtual disk will be created.  All
  subsequent references to "E:" will deal with the ram disk.  It appears that
  once installed, the only way to remove the ram disk is to reboot the system.

----
MENU40.LBR

Subject: Commodore 128

[line eater bait]

I am the owner of a Commodore 128 and a 1571.
I bought it for its versatility and would not mind its slow speed if
there were no exageration and it were bug free. But it is not the case.
I would like to know if these problems show up on U.S. or recent machines
or does anyone have comments or cure for the following:


128 Mode:

-The DOS shell file copy function exhibits the stange behaviour of
adding one byte to the file being copied. Harmless for program files,
it is a nuisance for text files. I'd be glad to have a correction
for this otherwise very handy program.

-The 1571 is double sided and faster than the 1541... until I get to
filling side two. On that side, writing is VERY slow. The drive
alternately accesses the data and the directory sectors for EACH
sector being written. Looks like it reads and/or writes the BAM (block
availability map) for each sector. On side one, the directory is
accessed only between a group of records. The SAVE command does however
fill both sides without directory access. It only occurs during other
I/O's (e. g. program output or file copy).

-The capslock key has no effect on the letter Q.

CP/M mode:

-Is there a way to assign the printer logical unit to the user port to
a parallel printer?
-There is a device driver supposed to drive a 6251 rs232 chip. But the
128 has none. What is it there for? I would appreciate to do rs232 I/O
(not modem).
-There is an evident lack of keyboard buffering and auto repeat.
-The screen output is very slow (80 column).
-Commodore statement of a 4MHz Z80 is a very subtle lie. It DOES 4MHz,
but only HALF of the time (each other half cycle of a 2MHz clock).
Really 2MHz. Would they pay half time employees at full rate?
-The CPM+ makes ridiculous little use of the alternate memory bank for
I/O buffers.
-In other words, is there a better CP/M than the one we get with the
machine?

[These are not opinions, but facts]

I'm trying to set up BYE510 on my C128 with 1670 modem.
I put in the proper insert, and have it running, except
when I type BYE E I get some information about the number of
calls, and then, continuously:

A
Echo error
A
Echo error

I assume this is something I'm doing wrong in the Modem configuartion
section.  What should the modem settings be for the 1670?  Thanks
in advance!

Hello -

     I've seen several references on the net for a portable CP/M
machine going by the name of "Bondwell".  Who is selling these things
in the Maryland area?

     Also, some questions to those already owning this portable:

	Are schematics and tech info available?

	I believe there are two Bondwell machines - one runs CP/M 2.2,
	the other runs 3.0 .  True?

	How many and which of the CP/M utilities (ASM, PIP, ED, etc) 
	are supplied?

	How much documentation is supplied?

	Is it bundled with any other software?

     If I get sufficient queries, I'll post a summary to the net.

Thanks -

Mark Becker

Reply to request from singpang%hlerul5.bitnet:

1. The only widely utilized mailing list for the C64/C128 is the USENET list
   called "net.micro.cbm".  This list is *not* gatewayed into the Arpanet.
   I have no idea if there is a USENET/BITNET gateway that passes this list.
   You can *submit* postings to "net.micro.cbm" by sending mail to
   microcomputer.cbm@rutgers.arpa.  However, you cannot receive the postings
   because of the lack of a bidirectional gateway.  Therefore, if you do
   submit a posting that requires a reply, be sure to ask for a carbon-copy
   to be sent directly to your address.

2. There are many communications programs, including Kermit, for the C128 in
   C64 mode.  There are a few (no Kermit) for the C128 in native mode.  There
   are at least 3 (IMP, MEX, and Kermit) for the C128 in CP/M mode.  In short,
   there is no shortage of comm. programs - it's just a matter of finding
   the one you want.  All 3 CP/M programs are in the SIMTEL20 archives (I know,
   BITNET people can't get those yet, but in time.....).

3/4. C64 and C128 disks are virtually identical (there are two flavors, single
   sided and double sided, but with a 1571 drive, either machine can read or
   write either format).  There are currently bugs in the drive ROM which make
   it semi-pointless to use double sided with C64 or C128 mode.  CP/M disk
   formats are simply random accessed variants of the basic C128 double or
   single sided formats - the three possible MFM formats are documented in 
   the (Commodore) C128 Programmer's Reference Manual, and with this knowledge,
   it is not tough reading or writing CP/M disk formats from non-CP/M modes
   (hint: use the U1 and U2 random access functions of the drive DOS).  On the
   other hand, CP/M cannot log in a non-CP/M formatted diskette, so reading or
   writing such from CP/M might be a hassle, if it is possible at all.

5. With the right communication software, a modem works great with the C128
   in any mode at 300 or 1200 baud.  The 128 has no UART, so there is so-called
   "bit-banging" code in both the ROM Kernal and in the CP/M BIOS to support
   receiving and sending bits at the right rate via internal clock interrupts.
   At 1200 baud, this eats up plenty of CPU time, but for general comm. 
   functions (terminal emulation, uploading, downloading, capture buffer), this
   is no problem as long as the remote system can handle an occasional XON/
   XOFF flow control sequence.  I say "with the right communication software"
   because there are bugs in the Kernel ROM, so you cannot use the RS-232 port
   code by the book.  You have your choice of either a TTL/Commodore
   User Port compatible modem (from several manufacturers including Commodore),
   or an ordinary RS-232 modem.  If you use an RS-232 modem, you need level
   converters between the user port and the modem - Commodore and others sell
   such converters, or you can make your own.  I use an Andersen-Jacobson 1259
   RS-232 modem with homebrew (transistor even!) inverters.  I use IMP, MEX,
   and Kermit in CP/M mode, TERM.PLUS, Kermit, XMOBUF, and Punter programs in
   C64 mode.  The only semi-useful program I've used in 128 mode is called
   MicroVT-128 and it has not matured into a stable product yet.

6. C128 CP/M 3.0 is a very faithful implementation of banked CP/M 3.0 with a
   58K TPA.  You should be using the 6DEC85 or 8DEC85 versions to get the
   full benefit of bug fixes, RS-232 port support, and RAM expansion support.
   The only reason *any* CP/M 3.0 program would not run on the 128 would be
   that is was not configurable for the terminal emulation used by the 128
   BIOS, that is an ADM31 (almost).  Many CP/M 2.2 programs will work without
   any problem at all; in this case, any incompatibility (in addition to
   terminal emulation) would be in the form of 2.2/3.0 differences; fortunately,
   these are minimal since 3.0 was designed to be largely compatible with
   2.2, while adding new features.  One example of incompatibility is that
   some 2.2 "unerase" programs are confused by the volume header and/or time
   stamps of 3.0 and thus will not work.  But the vast majority of CP/M 2.2
   products seem to work just fine (try before you buy!).  The 1571 disk drive
   will sense (and cause the BIOS to adapt to) MFM diskettes formatted for the
   Osborn (SSDD), Kaypro II, Kaypro IV, Epson (something or other...), and
   IBM-PC CP/M-86, and possibly some others; consult the manual for details.

Beware, the 128, even in CP/M mode, is not without it's faults.  The Z-80 is
only running at 2Mhz., so don't expect the performance of a 6Mhz. system.  
Screen updates are moderately slow (but not unusable - equivalent to somewhere
around 300 characters/second).  You should set the
baud rate down to 110 whenever you are not using the RS-232 port to minimize
interrupt processing overhead, and maximize *your* use of the CPU.  Diskette
reads (on a 1571 drive) are pleasingly fast (from MFM formatted diskettes), but
writes are quite a bit slower (there is a utility available which almost doubles
the write speed - much better).  40 column mode is almost useless (sideways
scrolling) for CP/M, so you better use an RGB or monochrome 80 column monitor.
And finally, ROM bugs in the 1571 drive make it nearly useless to try to use
double sided formatted diskettes in the non-CP/M modes (this has been fixed
by Commodore, but it is still not obvious how to get the new ROMS - new ROMS
are being used in newly manufactured units, but it would be hard to say if a
given drive on a dealer's shelf had the old or the new).

Sincerely,
Frank Prindle

I don't know, one would presume so, but I don't know where to get them.

True.  The Bondwell Model 12 runs,CP/M 2.2, Model 14 (which I have) runs 3.0

Quite a Few. PIP, ED, at least one macro assembler, I will have to make a list
and get back to you on that, but there is quite a bit of stuff

> 	How much documentation is supplied?

Documentation is so-so.  Better in some areas than others.  The DDT
documentation is non-existant, the ED documentation is ok, I guess, the PIP
documentation seems complete.  One of the manuals is just on the CPM utiltities.
There is at least one page for each utiltiy, but it does not always cover all
that you need to know

> 	Is it bundled with any other software?

Yes, Wordstar and Mailmerge (minus spelling checker), Calcstar, Datastar,
Reportstar.  All of these include manuals put out by Micropro.  No language
is included however.  I considered this a problem, but purchased Turbo
Pascal the next week.  The Bondwell 14 can read and write several different
disk formats including Kaypro II, and Osborne 1 double density, but cannot
format anything but it's own format.  I ended up getting a couple of disks
formated by an Osborne system and keep them for passing data to other systems.

The Bondwell is supposed to be a Kaypro II compatable system, and so far
it has been.  I have not bought much in the way of software (a spelling
checker, Turbo Pascal, Zork III, Right-Hand Man), but all was purchased
as if I were using a Kaypro II, and seems to work.  The only exception is
the Right-Hand Man, which I specified CP/M 3.0, and thinks there are only
24 lines on the screen (the screen is 25 lines X 80 Characters/line).

Please note all of the above is off the top of my head, and about a Bondwell 14.
I do not have any direct knowledge of the bondwell 12.

Something else as to using CP/M and a modem...

You must have the December 6(?) overlay for your CP/M 3.0. The system included
with the machine is *not* capable of using a modem! This overlay is available
on Quantum-Link for sure, and possibly GENIE. 

I have not used a 128 for over six months, however, and CBM may be including
the new version of CP/M with the machines by now. Surefire way to tell: Look
at the release date when you boot the system. If it's August, it's the old
one. The new one is dated December '85 or later. 

I suggest you use IMP or MEX for your modeming. They are superior to anything I
have seen in the C-128 public domain world.

This message marks an historic moment, and a bit of background history
which has brought us to this moment is in order.  Please bear with me
while you read this lead-in to details you have all been eagerly
awaiting at the end of this message.

Seven years ago this past Friday, August 29, 1979, INFO-CPM was formed
as a spin-off of INFO-MICRO, both homed at the time on MIT-MC.  The
following month Keith Petersen's Royal Oak RCP/M system was
discovered, and Keith was invited to directly participate in the
INFO-CPM discussions.  Through Keith's direct access, he was able to
upload, crudely at first, selected files for FTP from MIT-MC from his
vast up-to-date RCP/M collection.  As new files became available,
Keith made the announcements to the INFO-CPM list.  New contributions
and updates to existing files were likewise made available from other
ARPANET users.  Thus, the CP/M archives was born, with disk space
courtesy of the MIT-MC management.

This activity caused the development of several mainframe versions of
CP/M utilities, such as the first mainframe implementation of the
Christensen Protocol, in MacLisp, by Ed Barton, called LMODEM.  Then
Gail Zacharias developed MMODEM, USQ, HEXFIY, COMIFY, MAKLBR, DE-LBR
and others, some of which were modified for use on TOPS-20 systems.
Bill Westfield wrote the original and invaluable MODEM program for
TOPS-20, which has recently been overhauled into TMODEM.

Disk space was inherently limited on MIT-MC, and when the Macsyma
Consortium was dissolved at the end of September, 1983, SIMTEL20 at
White Sands Missile Range (WSMR) was already online and had disk space
to spare on the required 176MB RP06 boot disk.  (SIMTEL20 is a
contraction of the name of the branch which then owned the machine,
SIMulation and TELeprocessing, DECSYSTEM-20.)  During that month, the
CP/M collection was moved from MIT-MC to the RP06, designated as the
MICRO: structure, on SIMTEL20.  Already purchased for a closely
related project, the then named DARCOM Microcomputer Software Sharing
System (DMSSS), were the entire sets of the CPMUG, SIG/M, and PC/BLUE
distributions, which were uploaded as-is to MICRO:.  Since then we
managed to get placed on the tail end of the regional distribution of
both the SIG/M and PC/BLUE update sets which periodically extend both
of those collections.

As this was all going on, it became evident that a collection of
Unix/C versions of the CP/M utilities would be required and that
collection was started.  That collection has since come under the
sponsorship of another organization within the Army Materiel Command
(AMC) to which WSMR belongs.  That organization, Logistics Systems
Support Activity, LSSA, provided the funds for the 512MB disk drive
known as PD:, to which all the collections residing on the out-grown
MICRO: structure were moved in November, 1985.

In November, 1984, Rick Conn volunteered to start the extremely
popular Ada Software Repository, originally on PS: as there was no
room on MICRO:, and then moved to PD: when that device came online.

As with the CP/M archives in PD:<CPM.*> being considered the best and
most recent, the MSDOS archives are also in the process of being
similarly organized in PD:<MSDOS.*>, with files culled from the latest
releases of the PC/BLUE collection as well as the INFO-IBMPC
collections on ISI-B and Pete Galvin's collection on UTEXAS-20.

When the CP/M collection first started, there was only one directory
with subdirectories, and several not-necessarily CP/M-related
directories lived under that tree.  Recently, a new top-level
directory was created on PD:, named PD:<MISC>.  Now those generic
subdirectories in PD:<CPM.*>, PD:<UNIX.*>, and PD:<MSDOS.*> are being
moved to that new directory tree.

The original INFO-CPM list was maintained on MIT-MC until 1983 and
then moved to BRL, where it was maintained by Ron Natalie for a short
while.  Ron, who has been the maintainer of INFO-MICRO, among other
lists, drafted Dave Towson to maintain the INFO-CPM list on AMSAA.
Dave has been continuously maintaining the list since November 1983,
periodically rewriting and distributing the SIMTEL20 Archive Users
Guide, commonly referred to as the "Archive Blurb" and answering
numerous user requests for information on access to the SIMTEL20
collections.

As the subscription list to INFO-CPM grew, it was gatewayed into the
USENET community, first as fa.info-cpm, and now as a two-way
newsgroup, net.micro.cpm.  Later, members from other communities
joined the list from CSNET, BITNET, and others.  Meanwhile, new files
and entire collections were added to the SIMTEL20 archives and
announced to the INFO-CPM list.  Access to these files was inherently
limited to those with Internet FTP access to SIMTEL20, unless some
kind soul volunteered to mail selected files on request.

Recently, there was a flurry of messages pleading for some form of
automated access to the SIMTEL20 archives via net mail.  About two
weeks ago, while reading these pleadings while on travel in the
mountains of Colorado, I said that all the pieces were falling into
place to be put together to provide that service.  Maybe it was the
altitude that made me say that, but everything eventually did fall
into place in the two weeks since then.

A Mail File Server was written in C using a beta version of an about
to be released compiler for TOPS-20 systems.  If it wasn't for the
quick turnaround on reported bug fixes by the two principal
maintainers of that compiler and run-time library, Ken Harrenstien and
Ian Mackey at SRI-NIC, this program could not have been developed in
such a short time by a person whose only other claim to fame in C
programming is one other C program he co-authored two years ago.

The original concept for this service came from a similar service
developed by Jack Dongarra of the Argonne National Laboratory and Eric
Grosse of AT&T Bell Laboratories called NetLib, which is available
from ANL-MCS for mail access into its collection of well-indexed and
documented high quality public domain mathematical software routines.
Their work was supported, in part, by the National Science Foundation.
From their sources came that part of the package which extracts the
requestor's return address from the request file.

The SIMTEL20 version of this service has been in beta test for almost
two weeks now, with new features added and many bugs fixed since then.
While credits are being handed out, I wish to thank Matt Kimmel for
checking out access from the BITNET side, and Eric Hildum from the
USENET side.  And, to Keith Petersen, Dave Towson, Bernie Eiben, Rick
Conn, and Mark Crispin for participating in a lively discussion of the
principles of operation of this service.

Now, before I bombard you with details on how to access the files, let
me caution you that this system is experimental.  There is no such
thing as finding the "last" bug in any program.  Furthermore, I sit in
awe and fear that even selective and judicious use of this system by
the potential audience this message will eventually reach may overload
this machine or some of the fragile mail links between hosts on the
various networks connecting us all together.

This means that those of you already with FTP access to SIMTEL20 must
not use this service and continue using FTP.  There is no blocking
mechanism in place right now, but I will consider taking the time to
install one if you choose to ignore this request.  Those of you on
USENET, BITNET, and CSNET hosts should consider appointing one point
of contact through which you should funnel your requests and the
reconstructed files from the replies from this service should be made
available to all your local users.  This particularly applies to the
HELP, INFO, and BOOTSTRAP messages and the files they point to.

This message is being sent only to the readers of INFO-CPM so that we
can gauge the impact on the system.  Please do not redistribute this
message to any other mailing list or newsgroup.   Their time will come.

What follows is the message you get in response to the SEND HELP

--------------------

           HOW TO ACCESS THE SIMTEL20 ARCHIVES VIA NET MAIL

To obtain one or more files by netmail from the public domain archives
kept on SIMTEL20.ARPA, send a message to:

ARCHIVE-REQUEST@SIMTEL20.ARPA, or via uucp:
...!seismo!simtel20.arpa!archive-request
...!ucbvax!simtel20.arpa!archive-request
...!uw-beaver!simtel20.arpa!archive-request

The message body must contain lines beginning with the keyword SEND,
one SEND line for each file requested.  Case is not significant.

The general syntax of a SEND line is:

SEND format filename

In general, a filename consists of the following components:

device:<directory>file.type.generation

"device:" is usually PD:, and the combination of PD:<directory> is
expected unless an alias has been advertised of the form "alias:",
which takes the place of both device and directory fields.  The
generation field may be left off and defaulted to the highest
generation number.  "file.type" follows the usual filenaming
conventions.

In all formats listed below, if the file to be sent is larger than
55K, the file is sent in numbered parts.  The parts must be
reassembled in order and edited to remove any headers, preface, and
trailers before the process can be reversed to reconstruct the
original file.

Allowable formats are:

SEND HELP
	This file you are reading now.

SEND INFO
	A detailed description of the SIMTEL20 Archives, which
	includes this file, pointers to certain key files, and
	descriptions of various file transfer programs and related
	utilities.

SEND BOOTSTRAP
	A brief quick reference listing of filenames of the key
	utilities used to reconstruct files sent by the compression
	and encoding techniques listed below.

SEND DIR filespec
	This format returns a CRC list of the requested files, and is
	the only format which allows wildcard filenames (but not
	wildcard directory names).  The list is sent as an ASCII text
	file.  The wildcard characters are "*" and "%".  The asterisk
	means any number of characters, while the percent sign means
	exactly one character.  Either or both may appear in any
	combination in either or both the file or type fields, while
	only the asterisk may appear in the generation field.

SEND RAW filename
	If the file is ASCII, it is sent as-is, regardless of size.
	This format is the least efficient over network and mail
	gateway resources.  Use this format only if you absolutely
	must to get yourself bootstrapped.  Then please use one of the
	other formats listed below.

With the four formats listed below, if the file is ASCII and under 25k
characters, it is sent as-is, as if RAW format was requested.  Binary
files are always processed according to the requested format.
However, a request for ARC or SQ processing of files with type .ARC,
.LBR, or .%Q% is ignored and the original file is either uuencoded or
hexified (if possible), according to the requested format.  If the
file was not sent RAW, a short preface is inserted at the front of the
message describing the process actually taken and a CRC entry
describing the original file.

SEND ARE filename  or  SEND filename
	The original file is made into a uuencoded ARC file.

SEND ARH filename
	The original file is made into a hexified ARC file if the ARC
	file is under 64K bytes long.  Otherwise, an apology is
	returned instead of the requested file.

SEND SQE filename
	The original file is made into a uuencoded SQueezed file.

SEND SQH filename
	The original file is made into a hexified SQueezed file if the
	Squeezed file is under 64K bytes long.  Otherwise, an apology
	is returned instead of the requested file.

To get started in finding your way around the SIMTEL20 archives, send
another request: SEND INFO

The ARCHIVE-REQUEST address is serviced by a batch job that
reschedules itself one hour after it completes the current pass.  That
frequency is subject to change.

Can anyone out there tell me anything good or bad about the Utah Fortran
compiler from Ellis Computing that I see advertised in Byte?  This compiler
(along with compilers for Cobol and Pascal, and intrepreters for Basic and
Pilot) is advertised at $39.95. Normally I'd guess that it's a low quality
product (you usually get what you pay for) but this company has been around
for several years marketing the same thing for CP/M (called Nevada Fortran).
I also know that there ARE some good quality compilers out there for a low
price.  Does anyone know if this is one of them?  Thanks.

Dustin - If you are interested in tracking expenses by user-defined
catagories, just grab any dbms (like dBase) and set up a few fields like
ck. no., date, payee, amount, and catagory.  Once your check register(s)
are loaded, you can just sum by catagory.

I have been doing this for about 5 years and it works like a champ.
(The only problem comes up when my wife says things like "We spent
HOW MUCH at the supermarket last year!!!???")

Re:   Previous request-for-information about P2DOS

Many thanks to the those who responded.  As pointed out by "Bernie
<EIBEN@MARLBORO.DEC.COM>" my only real problem was that the .COM file
created using the utilites provided in the .LBR is just a touch to
large.  A LOAD/SAVE 14 restores the file to its actual and proper
size.  After that it suddenly worked just fine....

...Well, almost:  If others attempt to install P2DOS, be forwarned
that as distributed the search path table is stored at 0040H
and following.  This area is designated as reserved for BIOS use
(not for the BDOS).  So, confirm first that your BIOS does not use
this scratch area or move the search path table elsewhere.  (My H89
BIOS--vanilla from Heath--does use it :-)

Subject: Assembling SYSLIB with ZAS and Z80ASM (SLR)
Reply-To: SAGE@LL.ARPA

Relayed from my RCP/M...I've had complaints from users about not being
able to assemble the new SYSLIB, Z3LIB and VLIB wihout purchasing the
ZAS assembler.  It used to be possible to use M80/L80.  This file
tells about one alternative.

                ASSEMBLING SYSLIB WITH ZAS AND Z80ASM (SLR)

                                  Jay Sage
                             September 4, 1986


     I was moved to write these comments after reading Richard Conn's
article on the libraries (SYSLIB, Z3LIB, and VLIB) in Micro/Systems Journal. 
In that article he states that ZAS is the only assembler that is capable of
assembling the new version 3.6 release of SYSLIB.  This statement seemed
both odd and self-serving, odd because ZAS is always promoted as being
compatible with other standard assemblers and self-serving because Conn is
now an employee of Echelon, which distributes ZAS.  I began to do a little
investigating.

     Please understand that I am generally a strong supporter of Echelon,
the company marketing the Z-System and its support programs.  They are, I
believe, the last hope for 8-bit CP/M-type computers, and we should support
them by buying their products and encouraging our friends to do the same. 
However, ZAS has been a sticking point for me.  I formed a less than
enthusiastic opinion of ZAS at the beginning and tried to help the author
make an honest Z-System program out of it.  Unfortunately, its subsequent
development has done nothing to change my original opinion (more on that
below).  Once the superbly written, high performance assembly-language tools
from SLR Systems became available at a comparable (slightly higher) price, I
saw no reason to settle for the mediocrity of ZAS.  If Conn had said in the
article that the SYSLIB source was written to be assembled using ZAS and
might require slight modifications for other assemblers, I would not be
writing this comment.

     I found it hard to believe that Z80ASM would have any significant
problem assembling SYSLIB, so I gave it a try.  The complete assembly of 189
source modules to Microsoft-format REL files took only 11 minutes and 25
seconds on my Ampro floppy-based system, an average of 3.6 seconds per
module (considering the tremendous disk thrashing required to read 189
source files and write 189 REL files, things would have been much faster
with a hard disk).

     It turned out that very strictly speaking Conn was right.  There were
five files, the ones dealing with library management (SLUDIR, SLUOPEN,
SLUCLOSE, SLUREAD, and SLUINIT), that produced error messages.  The reason
was their use of ZAS's idiosyncratic ".IN" insert pseudo-op.  If one spends
a moment with a text editor and changes the five instances of ".IN" to
".INCLUDE", then Z80ASM works beautifully.  Knowing Steve Russell of SLR, I
would not be surprised if the next version of Z80ASM recognizes the ".IN"
pseudo-op.  It already tolerates ZAS's peculiar requirement of square
brackets where other assemblers use normal parentheses.  Changing ".IN" to
"MACLIB" and putting in the ".Z80" directives might even make M80 work (I
did not try that).  If anyone reading Conn's comment thought that he should
buy ZAS just to be able to work with the SYSLIB source code, he was
seriously misled.  I am sure that almost any assembler using Zilog mnemonics
can be made to work with very little effort.  Since the code appears to use
no Zilog-only instructions, one could probably even convert the source back
to the Intel mnemonics in which Conn wrote the original routines and use an
Intel assembler.

     Having gone through the assembly process with Z80ASM, I was now curious
to see how ZAS would perform.  I got out a copy of ZAS version 2.3.  Since
ZAS does not support internal script files and multiple assemblies as Z80ASM
does, I prepared a ZEX script file to perform the task.  At first I wrote
the script to invoke ZAS for each module.  Then it occurred to me that it
was unfair to force ZAS to reload for each module when Z80ASM only had to
load once.  So I decided to use the ZCPR "GO" command for all but the first
module.

    For some reason I decided first to make sure that ZAS could be rerun
using "GO", as Z-System programs generally should.  I tried it manually on a
pair of files with the command line "ZAS FILE1;GO FILE2".  It seemed to work
fine.  I ended up with two appropriately named REL files, but something
about the ZAS output message made me suspicious -- both files were reported
as having the same number of lines, symbols, etc.  Sure enough -- ZAS messed
up.  It gave the appearance of working but in fact did not, the worst kind
of failure.

     I don't know exactly what ZAS is doing, since the second output REL
file did not correspond to either the second or the first source file.  One
thing is for sure.  The author of ZAS still does not fully understand the
principles of Z-System programming.  [My first disillusionment with ZAS came
when I tried for many months to get the author to make it support the ZCPR3
program error flag (I even sent the code to do it).  Steve Russell grasped
the principle immediately and implemented it quickly and correctly; he even
made the logical extensions of the concept to CP/M3 (set CP/M3 error flag)
and CP/M2.2 (kill $$$.SUB submit file).]  ZAS apparently relies on the
initial loading of ZAS.COM from disk to initialize some data space. 
Programs that are to work under the "GO" command must, obviously, perform
all required initializations in code.  Otherwise the buffers, flags, and
file control blocks will not necessarily be in their initialized state when
the program is rerun using "GO".

     With a ZEX script that reloaded ZAS for each assembly (I had no
choice), ZAS took 43 minutes and 30 seconds to assemble SYSLIB, nearly four
times as long as Z80ASM.  Carrying out the five source changes to make
SYSLIB compatible with other assemblers, including Z80ASM, would take much
less than the 22-minute time difference.

     One final note on the SYSLIB code itself.  There are some unfortunate
inconsistencies in the code due to reliance on the truncated external
references of the Microsoft REL format.  The SLR assemblers can optionally
generate special SLR-format REL files (only the SLR linker can process
these) that, among other advantages, support 16-character external names. 
When assembling SYSLIB to SLR-format REL files, however, one discovers that
the external and internal names of some routines in SYSLIB are not
consistent.  The module S0FILEIO.Z80 makes reference to the externals
"FI$CLOSE" and "FO$CLOSE".  However, the module SFILEIO, which defines these
references, specifies the public names as "FI$CLOS" and "FO$CLOS".  With
Microsoft truncation of externals to 6 or 7 characters (I don't know which
ZAS does), these are equivalent.  In making the SLR versions of the
libraries (SYSSLR.REL, Z3SLR.REL, and VSLR.REL), I had to correct these
inconsistencies.

	The New Z System
	by Richard Conn, 6 Sep 1986

	I have been working quietly on the development of the new Z System
for quite some time, and I feel that I must speak out now on what I am doing
so that people will know the true story.  This presentation is short and not
complete, but it is enough to answer some basic questions without taking too
much of my time away from the development activities.


Why create a new Z System?
--------------------------
	First of all, why am I creating a new Z System?  There are many
reasons:
		1) I have studied the old Z System for over two years now,
reviewing it for flaws and weaknesses.  From the beginning, I have stated
that the Z System is evolutionary, and I have enough new ideas now to implement
the next step in this evolution.
		2) I have been learning many new things about other
environments, including Ada Programming Support Environments (APSEs),
UNIX, SUN window-based systems, TOPS-20, VAX/VMS, and Symbolics workstations.
I have seen many good ideas that I would like to incorporate into my
personal computer environment, the Z System.
		3) My next real goal is the development of a banked Z System
followed by a multitasking Z System.  An improvement in the current non-banked
Z System is a logical step along the way, giving me a platform from which to
experiment with some of the new ideas before fully incorporating them into
the new systems.  ZCPR 3.3 is not a goal, but is a milestone along the road
to a goal.
		4) My needs have changed and are continuing to change, and
the old Z System no longer meets my needs.  I have to change the system in
order to continue advancing toward my other goals.

	At a recent talk I gave at the Trenton Computer Festival, someone
asked me if I plan to move over to the IBM community.  If I was motivated
by profit to a large extent, my answer would obviously have been yes.  But
my principal motivation is to learn and grow and to have fun doing it.  The
money is a very nice side effect, but it is not the driving side effect.
I definitely intend to keep learning through the Z System.  The Z System,
coupled with the very rich computer environment I am accessing through
my communications system, has enough potential to meet my needs for many
years to come.


New Standards
-------------
	Good software engineering principles and common sense indicate that
a lot of benefit can be derived through standards.  The evolving ZCPR 3.3
and Z System now have a number of standards going for them:

		1) a common language, implemented by the ZAS assembler
		2) a common support library, implemented by SYSLIB, Z3LIB,
			and VLIB
		3) a common format for all assembly language programs,
			implemented by PPAL - the Pretty Printer for
			Assembly Language
		4) a common operating system and support base, implemented
			by ZCPR3 and ZRDOS
		5) a common documentation format which allows easier
			upgrading of the documentation as the programs
			change; this system is for both hardcopy (MAN)
			and online (HELP) mediums
		6) a common configuration management system, CONFIG,
			which allows users to easily identify their
			configuration and determine if all of their
			programs are current
		7) page-relocatable structures for system segments,
			ZCPR 3.3 itself, and ZRDOS, which server to
			further support transportability and make
			installation easier
		8) a very robust communications protocol, supporting
			packet sizes from 1 data byte to 4K data bytes

	You will see all of these in the months to come.


The Libraries
-------------
	One key point to make here is that I purposely did not mention
a common binary structure, like the Environment Descriptor.  The Environment
Descriptor is not a standard, but the interface to it, namely Z3LIB and VLIB,
is.  This was purposely done so that future growth would be supported.
As the Z System evolves, it will probably be necessary to delete old features
which are no longer needed in favor of new features which provide new
capabilities.  If the binary structures, like the Environment Descriptor,
are to preserved, then the growth will be hampered by the lack of availability
of space in which to implement the new features.  By standardizing on the
interface to the Environment Descriptor and not the structure of the
descriptor itself, then the Environment Descriptor can take any desired form
without concern for the impact on other programs.  Specifically,

		ld	hl,envadr	; get base address of env
		ld	de,offflag	; get offset to a flag
		add	hl,de		; point to the flag
		ld	a,(hl)		; get the flag value

would be severly impacted if the structure of the Environment Descriptor
changed, but a call like:

		ext	getflag		; reference library routine to get flag
		...
		call	getflag		; return flag in A

would not be impacted at all by such a change.  The library containing the
GETFLAG routine would be impacted, but it is a lot easier to change one
module in a library and reassemble 100 programs than it is to track the
necessary changes in, edit, and then reassemble 100 programs.

	With one exception, the routines in the new Z3LIB for ZCPR 3.3
have the same names and interfaces as the routines in the old Z3LIB.
Conversion is simple - reassembly is all that is required.

	Unfortunately, many programmers have not yet learned this lesson.
They continue to write code which does not use the libraries.  Imagine
the work that will be required to go through their programs, modifying the
references in order to be compatable with the banked ZCPR3.  Imagine them
going through the work again for the multitasking ZCPR3, and again and again
as ZCPR3 continues to evolve.  Thanks to Echelon, ZCPR 3.3 is still
compatable at the binary level in terms of the Environment Descriptor.
Certain values have been replaced with others, so changes will still be
necessary, but many of the key values have stayed in the same places with
the same meanings.  My original approach was to free up all of the dead
space left by the removed values, making more room at the end for growth,
but Echelon convinced me that the impact on programs written by those who
didn't understand the basic principle of the libraries would be devastating.
Thanks to the new design, it only took me 3 hours to convert back with no
loss of functionality -- yet another benefit from the new structured design
of the system -- but I can guarantee that the future systems will not be
converted in this manner.

	If everyone starts thinking in terms of the libraries, the future
growth of the Z System is assured.  If people cling to the old ideas of not
using the libraries, then it is clear that growth will be curtailed.


The Bottom Line
---------------
	I am moving forward with the development of the new ZCPR 3.3 and
the new Z System.  As you can see, there are many changes in it, and I have
barely skimmed the surface.  I will move ahead and release it only when I am
satisfied that it is usable to others.  Documentation must go with the
release, so the release will not take place until the documentation is ready.
My goal is to meet my needs, as outlined above, and this goal will be met.
I thank those of you who have been supportive in the efforts of Echelon and
myself, and I sincerely hope that you will share in my enthusiasm for the
new ZCPR 3.3 when I release it to you.

	ZAS (from Echelon)/Z80ASM (from SLR), and the Z System Libraries
		by Richard Conn, 6 September 1986

	Jay Sage's recent comments in the file ZAS-SLR.DOC are understood,
although somewhat in error, and I feel that it is necessary to clarify my
position on the subject.

	First, as Jay admits, there are no errors in the article.  ZAS is
the only assembler (to my knowledge and his) that can assemble the libraries
without error at this time.  Granted, I'll take Jay's word for it that five
library modules (LUDIR, LUOPEN, LUCLOSE, LUREAD, and LUINIT) can be modified in
a minor way to allow Z80ASM to assemble them.  What Jay doesn't know is that
the new Z3LIB requires all 70+ modules to be edited and reassembled in order to
use the SLR assembler with them.

	Second, Jay is totally wrong and uninformed about my relationship
with Echelon.  I am not an employee of Echelon and have never been an
employee of Echelon.  I receive royalty checks from Echelon for the sale
of my books and software and I work closely with them.  The sale of ZAS
has no impact whatsoever on my income.  Obviously, the sale of the libraries
does, since the libraries constitute a product line of which I am the author.
I really resent Jay's insinuations and feel they reflect very poorly on him.

	Third, ZAS is the only assembler I use today.  I use it for the
following reasons: (1) it meets my needs, (2) it represents a standard
language that Echelon and I have some influence on, (3) it is reliable
in the way I use it, and (4) it is supported.  I have been an advocate of
Ada for many years now, and the reasons for my love of Ada include the same
reasons given in the previous sentence (with the exception that I don't
have as extensive influence on the development of Ada as I do of ZAS).  I
have seen the benefits of having a standard language and am completely sold
on them.  Among many other reasons, having a standard language like ZAS
allows us to change the language definition as our needs change, and I
definitely have such changes in mind for the future.

	Fourth, I have nothing whatsoever against SLR or any other
company or its products.  I have heard others say that the SLR tool is
a fine tool, and I have no reason to doubt such a statement.  I have
never used the SLR Z80ASM tool, but this may change since SLR contacted
me and wanted to send me a copy.

	Fifth, we are not at an impass.  Taking a lesson from the Ada
community, we see Ada as a standard language with over 50 different compilers
for it.  All of these compilers implement the same language, which means
that there are no subsets or supersets, and I can write an Ada program on
any computer using any one of these compilers and port this program to
any other computer using any other of these compilers.  Porting the program
amounts to placing the source code on the target system, compiling, and
running.  No change to the source code at all.  But these compilers are not
all identical.  Some are faster than others, some generate more efficient
code than others.

	I want to see the same thing happen in the Z System community.
Any source code program can be ported to any Z System machine and assembled
with the standard assembly language.  This was my goal in standardizing on
ZAS from the beginning.  Echelon will soon be offering an implementation of
C, which I haven't seen yet, but if it meets the four requirements outlined
above, I imagine that I will adopt it in the same way.

	This action does not close the Z System market in any way, just like
Ada did not close the compiler market.  The vendors who wanted a piece of
the Ada action simply (actually, after enormous investments) marketed their
own Ada compilers which were validated.  Validation meant that each compiler
was approved by the US Government Ada Joint Program Office after passing
through a suite of over 4000 tests to assure that it compiled Ada programs
with no supersets or subsets.  This test suite was not exhaustive, and some
minor differences exist in the compilers, but the test suite is under
constant revision to make it progressively better.

	Echelon supports something called the "Z Team", which is a
team of people developing products for the Z System.  The authors of ZAS,
DSD, ZDM, the new C compiler, etc., as well as myself are on this team.
We receive our own mailings from Echelon as a team and are kept up to
date with each other's activities.  We also receive internal data on what
Echelon is up to.  I understand that Echelon and SLR, which is the subject
of this particular message, discussed the possibility of SLR joining the
Z team (ie, Echelon carrying their product), but an agreement was
not reached.  The Z Team works well together overall.

	If SLR or any other company wants to join in Echelon's adventure
with the Z System, there is no reason that yet another team, one concerned
with the Z System standard language (which is now ZAS only) and other
details of the Z System development, can be formed.  It is not appropriate
to use the Echelon Team for this purpose, since companies that may be
competators of Echelon may be involved.  The Z System as a standard
goes beyond specific companies.

	With a standard language, call it ZA, then ZAS and Z80ASM could
become products which compete with each other fairly and we could still
have ONE language for the Z System.  One language is what I want, and
I don't care if it is just ZAS or a group of assemblers made by a group
of companies.

;%Description:
;	PPAL is a Pretty Printer for Assembly Language for the Z System.
;Its purpose is to reformat assembly language source programs in order to
;have all Z System programs conform to a standard structure.  PPAL is highly
;configurable, accepting directives from both the command line and the source
;code itself, so that PPAL may be used to format programs in different ways
;for a variety of standards.
;	Directives for specific configuration of the pretty printing process
;may be presented on the command line or within the body of the code in
;special comment lines, beginning with ";#".  The following directives are
;recognized.  In each general case (like, Au), the first letter indicates the
;directive name, and the following letters indicate types of characters which
;may be specified; specifically:
;		o - option chars specific to the directive
;		u - case indication, U for Upper-case, L for Lower-case,
;			X for unchanged
;		y - yes/no indication, Y for Yes, N for No, X for unchanged
;
;	Au - controls the case of operands (arguments)
;		AU makes non-quoted alphabetic argument characters upper-case
;		AL makes non-quoted alphabetic argument characters lower-case
;		AX leaves the case of argument characters unchanged
;	By - remove blank lines
;		BY (yes) turns on removal of blank lines
;		BN (no) turns off removal of blank lines
;		BX (unchanged) is the same as BN
;	Cou, Coy - comment line formatting (a comment line is a line beginning
;	    with a semicolon, as opposed to an embedded comment)
;		CWy controls removal of the space character after the
;		    semicolon
;			CWY (yes) removes the space after the semicolon if a
;			          space is present, else no change
;			CWN (no) inserts the space after the semicolon if no
;			         space is present, else no change
;			CWX (unchanged) makes no change
;		CFu controls case of the first character in the comment line
;			CFU makes the first character upper-case
;			CFL make the first character lower-case
;			CFX leaves the case of the first character unchanged
;		CAu controls case of all characters in the comment line
;		    except the first character if CFU or CFL is in effect
;			CAU makes all characters upper-case
;			CAL makes all characters lower-case
;			CAX leaves the case of all characters unchanged
;	Eou, Eoy - embedded comment formatting
;		ECy controls placement of the embedded comment if it begins
;		    after field4 (column 33)
;			ECY (yes) places embedded comments on the next line
;			ECN, ECX (no, unchanged) leaves embedded comments
;				on the same line
;		EWy controls removal of the space character after the
;		    semicolon
;			EWY (yes) removes the space after the semicolon if a
;			          space is present, else no change
;			EWN (no) inserts the space after the semicolon if no
;			         space is present, else no change
;			EWX (unchanged) makes no change
;		EFu controls case of the first character in the comment
;			EFU makes the first character upper-case
;			EFL make the first character lower-case
;			EFX leaves the case of the first character unchanged
;		EAu controls case of all characters in the comment
;		    except the first character if EFU or EFL is in effect
;			EAU makes all characters upper-case
;			EAL makes all characters lower-case
;			EAX leaves the case of all characters unchanged
;	Ioy - indent lines subordinate to IFs or MACROs
;		I+ increases the indentation level by 1 character
;		I- decreases the indentation level by 1 character (0 min)
;		IIy controls indentation for the IF/ELSE/ENDIF pseudo-ops
;			IIY causes all opcodes subordinate to an IF to be
;			     indented one character; each successive IF
;			     causes another indentation; ENDIF brings the
;			     indentation level out; ELSE temporarily brings
;			     the indentation level out for the ELSE pseudo-op
;			     only
;			IIN, IIX (no, unchanged) causes indentation under IFs
;			     to not take place
;		IMy controls indentation for the MACRO/ENDM pseudo-ops
;			IMY causes all opcodes subordinate to a MACRO to be
;			     indented one character; ENDM brings the
;			     indentation level out
;			IMN, IMX (no, unchanged) causes indentation under
;			     MACROs to not take place
;	Lou, Loy - control format of labels
;		LFu controls the case of the first character of a label
;			LFU makes the first character upper-case
;			LFL makes the first character lower-case
;			LFX leaves the case of the first character unchanged
;		LAu controls the case of all characters in a label except
;		    the first character if LFU or LFL is in effect
;			LAU makes all characters upper-case
;			LAL makes all characters lower-case
;			LAX leaves the case of all characters unchanged
;		LCy controls the presence of a colon after a normal label
;			LCY ensures that there is a colon after each label
;			LCN ensures that there is no colon after each label
;			LCX has no effect on a trailing colon; if one was
;			    present in the input, it is present in the output
;		LSy controls the presence of a colon after a special label,
;		    where a "special" label is a label in front of a MACRO,
;		    SET, or EQU pseudo-op
;			LSY ensures that there is a colon after a special label
;			LSN ensures that there is no colon after a spec label
;			LSX has no effect on a trailing colon; if one was
;			    present in the input, it is present in the output

;	If no directives are given, the format F1 is selected.  F1 is always

;settings or all settings within this default.
;
;	Examples of various forms a label may take on:
;		Forms		AbCd	hello	EXEC
;		--------	----	-----	----
;		LFX, LAX	AbCd	hello	EXEC

;
;	Directives may be placed in any order with any or no delimiters:
;		"LFXLAU"	"LFX LAU"	"LFX,LAU"
;have the same meanings.  This applies to both command lines and embedded
;comments.
;		PPAL file1,file2 LFX LAU
;		;#LFX, LAU
;	Note that allowing directives embedded in the files they are acting
;on allows one part of the file to take on one format and another part of the
;file to take on another format.

Greetings fellow CP/M'ers.

I have over a Megabyte of new CP/M software that I would like to get out
in the world as shareware. It was originally intended to be a commercial
product, but I think the time has passed for that. What I want to know is
how to go about doing it. Posting it to the net might raise just a few
hackles, so I'm reluctant to do that. Also, spending a few hundred dollars
to ship it to a BBS a thousand or so miles away doesn't sound attractive.
(I'm physically in Edmonton, Alberta - home of West Edmonton Mall.)

What I have to give away is a full programming language system. The language,
called Draco (pronounced Drayko), has been in use for a couple of years now,
so the compiler is fairly stable, as are the other utilities. The compiler
compiles at about 1500 lines per minute (5 MHz 8085) directly to relocatable
object files. The linker is similarly capable. Code produced is about on
par with the best produced by any C or Pascal compiler I've heard of. As an
example, the compiler itself is about 10000 lines. It compiles on a single
8" floppy in under 10 minutes, yielding about 40K of code. For small programs,
under 100 lines, the time to load the compiler is easily the dominant factor.
All of the tools are easy to use, and fit well into CP/M. Again, as an
example, to build the compiler from scratch, I just type

	draco dr*
	link dr1 dr2 dr3 dr4 dr5 dr6 dr7 dr8 dr9 -sodraco

(I built file patterns into the compiler, but not the linker - sigh.) The
entire package includes fairly complete documentation on everything, a few
thousand lines of sample sources (including a CRT-oriented adventure game
system needing only a scenario), and several utilities. Major programs:

	draco.com - the compiler itself
	link.com - the linker
	drlib.com - the library builder
	ddis.com - the disassembler
	das.com - a simple, one-pass assembler
	xref.com - call cross referencer
	trrun.lib - 8080 version of run-time library (quite comprehensive)
	trcpm.lib - CP/M-80 interface stubs
	crt.lib - terminal independent CRT I/O library (facilities vary from
		simple cursor addressing up through on screen formatter,
		menu builder and forms input routines)
	config.com - program to configure .set programs to a given terminal
	config.dat - database of terminal definitions (from a termcap)
	ded.set - visual programming editor
	hedit.set - visual hex editor/viewer
	cmp.set - visual file comparer
	- several CRT oriented games. Some are trivial, but two are major
		entities in their own right.

OK, so what should I do with this stuff? (Nasty comments can be directed to
/dev/null.) I'm willing to package up one or two copies (takes 5 single
sided single density disks) and send them to major sites (note that the
stuff is SHAREWARE, not FREEWARE), but I do not want to get into distributing
it myself - I figure I'm better off porting my compiler to the 68000 family.

Cc: microcomputer.cbm@rutgers.ARPA

The C128 can (in CP/M mode with a 1571 disk drive) read, write, and format the
following diskette formats:

   Single Sided Commodore GCR CP/M 2.2 (32 tracks of 17 (256 byte) sectors)
   Single Sided C128 CP/M 3.0 GCR (680 logical tracks of 1 (256 byte) sector)
   Double Sided C128 CP/M 3.0 GCR (1360 logical tracks of 1 (256 byte) sector)
   Epson QX10 DS MFM (80 tracks of 10 (512 byte) sectors)
   IBM CP/M 86 SS MFM (40 tracks of 8 (512 byte) sectors)
   IBM CP/M 86 DS MFM (80 tracks of 8 (512 byte) sectors)
   Kaypro II SS MFM (40 tracks of 10 (512 byte) sectors)
   Kaypro IV DS MFM (80 tracks of 10 (512 byte) sectors)
   Osborn DD MFM (80 tracks of 5 (1024 byte) sectors)

Hope this clarifys things.  Most Commodore documentation implies there are
additional formats, but without committing to what they are.  Thus, the above
are obviously all the "official" formats!

Rick - After reading Jay,s message and your reply regarding SYSLIB, I decided
to take a look to see whether the archives still contained a version of SYSLIB
that could be assembled with M80.  I was surprised when the string-search of
CPM.CRCLST failed to come up with ANY entry for SYSLIB.  I thought for sure it
would be in the ZCPR2 directory.

     How about restoring to the archives the latest version of SYSLIB that
will still work with the tools lots of people already have?  It seems a shame
to limit the use of such a good thing to those who wish to purchase a new
assembler.

	The original ZCPR 3.0 SYSLIB is in PD:<ZSYS.SYSLIB>.  It is also
in PD:<SIGM> in the proper volume (as referenced by the article).  The
new libraries will be released when ZCPR 3.3 is released.

	In PD:<ZSYS> are:
		ZSYS.CRCLST
		ZSYS.USAGE - frequency of access/most popular
		ZSYS.SNP - snapshot

	The ZSYS archive is like the ADA archive in its management,
and the ZSYS archive is for Z System - specifics only.

		Rick

PS. Don't forget that any assembler compatable with the Microsoft REL
format can USE the new SYSLIB ... you don't have to assemble it to use it.
Using it is simply a matter of linking.

Hi all!
I seem to be having some trouble with the Z80 cartridge I purchased recently
for my C-64.  It doesn't want to boot up on my machine.  I did find some
information that the Z80 will not work on the later models of the C-64,
namely, the 3rd and 4th models.
Does anybody out there have any information on how to make the Z80 work on
these later models?  It would be a great help.
     
Thanks in advance,

I recently purchased a VT-100 clone and am thinking of purchasing a
low-cost CP/M box to attach to it.  Could anyone answer the following
questions:

	* Does CP/M terminal support handle VT-100's?  Is there some
	type of Install program, or do I have to hack the BIOS to make
	things work?

	* Does anyone know of cheap CP/M boxes that can be had?  SWP
	products makes the ATR8000, which is a CP/M system that can be
	attached to Ataris and RS-232 terminals.  I have also seen the
	"Little Board" advertised in Byte, which is supposed to be a
	CP/M system that can be mounted in a disk drive case along
	with the drive.  Ideally, I would like to spend as little
	money as possible.  I am looking for 64K and two drives.

	* What Emacs-like editors run under CP/M?  I know of Mince,
	but I have heard that it has nasty bugs (at least its
	incarnation on the PC did).  Is it possible to get MicroEmacs
	to run in 64K?  It has conditional compilation for CP/M-86 --
	will this also work with CP/M-80?

Please send replies by E-mail.  Thank you.

Subject: Z80 cartridge for C64

The Z80 CP/M add-on cartridge for the Commodore 64 *will not* work on any C64
which contains the newer improved video (VIC II) chip.  The reason is that the
original video chip (used during about the first year of C64 production) had
a flaw in the derivation of the internal clocks and the processor clock from
the color clock input - this flaw caused the dot-clock to be in-phase with the
horizontal scan rate (a no-no for NTSC color character generation). The net
result was excessive chroma distortion of the characters in most color combi-
nations on a TV set or NTSC monitor.

It took Commodore a while to realize what the problem was, but eventually they
fixed it.  Unfortunately, the phase relationship between the processor clock
and the dot clock was irrevocably altered, and all CP/M cartridges (which
worked with the old chips) suddenly croaked.  I think the Federal Trade
Commission considered this a massive enough screw-up on Commodore's part to
order them to refund the purchase price on any and all CP/M cartridges, which
they did and are still doing.

As the proud owner of one of these, your only alternatives are:

  1. Find a C64 owner with one of the old VIC II chips (display red characters
     on a black background and look at the output on a TV set - if you can't
     read every other character, it's the old chip.  If the display is quite
     readable, it's the new chip) and swap chips with him.  He'll enjoy the
     better video; your CP/M cartridge will work.  However, unless you're using
     a "separated" video monitor (e.g. C= 1702), your eyes will suffer!

  2. Contact Commodore and ask how to get your money back!

Sincerely,
Frank Prindle

801PRT11 - MPS801 file printer version 1.1 is now available from
SIMTEL20 as:

Filename			Type	 Bytes	 CRC

Directory PD:<CPM.C128>
801PRT11.LBR.1			BINARY	 27136  4663H

This is a file printer designed with the Commodore MPS801 and 1525
printers in mind.  It should, however, work with any printer that does
not need linefeeds.  It sends two extra carriage returns to the
printer at the end to clear out the buffer, so that no lines will be
dropped as happens with many file listers when used with the MPS801.
It also filters out linefeeds.

This source code and the program are in the public domain. Modify them
as you see fit.

Update:
9/7/86 - Removed code-wasting check to see if printer opened ok
         since it didn't work and added tab expansion to make
         version 1.1.

The files included in the original distribution library for 801prt11
are:

801PRT11.INF - Info on the distribution library
801PRT10.DOC - Documentation for 801PRT11
801PRT11.C   - C source code for 801PRT11
801PRT11.COM - The actual 801PRT11 program.
801PRT11.UPD - Update notes.

Enjoy the program!!

My trusty Kermit (CP4) which ran like a champ over a TAC to a TOPS-20
Kermit no longer will talk.  File transfers abort without a single
packet successfully passed.  Probably due to the new TAC software...
Anybody got a fix?

Message-ID:  <8609091222.aa15776@VGR.BRL.ARPA>

     I read Keith Petersen's message of July 28 on the Avatex 1200 bps modem
and Steve Sanders glowing testimonial, and decided that I could finally break
away from the 300 baud mode.  I ordered the Avatex from The Wholesale Outlet of
Albany, NY, and charged it to my Visa account.
 
     A few days later I received a note from them saying that the modem was on
back order and would be shipped in 30 days.  Well, at $87 I figured I could
wait a bit.
 
     After a little more than 30 days had passed, UPS dropped off a package
which I eagerly opened to find, not an Avatex but, an EasyData 1200D.  A quick
look at the invoice revealed that the price was not $87 but $110.
 
     Has this happened to anyone else on the net?
 
     Is this some kind of "bait-and-switch" scam?
 
     Should I call The Wholesale Outlet and cuss at them or thank them?
 
     Does anyone have any experience using this modem?
 
     This modem is manufactured by a company called GCH Systems of Sunnyvale,
CA.  I quickly tried it out on the DDN and it worked flawlessly at 300 and 1200
bps.  (My old 300 baud modems would be affected by noisy phone lines and would
result in numerous crc errors while downloading).
 
     It seems to do everything the Avatex does and it has a built-in speaker
too.  I realize that $110 is still a great price for a 1200 bps modem but I
can't help feeling a bit uneasy about this unexpected substitution.
 
     Any information on this "EasyData 1200D" modem or on "GCH Systems" or on
"The wholesale Outlet" or just a few soothing words to allay my fears, will be
greatly appreciated.

Gentlemen:

I need to locate a public domain assembler compatible with the MAC assembler
supplied by Digital Research.  As I am trying to modify a BIOS apparently
assembled with this assembler, I also need the macro libraries containing
the disk parameter table macros.  

My access to the network is somewhat restricted by the form of our connection;
however I can transfer files located on SIMTEL20.

				Thank you,

This may not be fully MAC compatible, but it's worth a try.  It's a
public domain Z80 macro assembler.

I have a problem concerning the archive-request mechanism that is
in place at SIMTEL20.

It seems that when I attempt to get the <CPM.STARTER-KIT> files (in
particular USQ120.COM), I receive the file in a 'squeezed' format.
Well, needless to say, I cannot unsqueeze this file (I am using
the SEND RAW PD:<CPM.STARTER-KIT>USQ120.COM request command.)

Am I doing something wrong?  Is there a way of getting a USQ120.ASM?

Or have I yet to fly the required number of bombing missions?
Is Major Major in? Oh, he is only 'in' when he is not here?  :-)

Addt'l comments 08/08/86

I now have one of the Basic Time 2400 modems, I placed an order
for it on a Monday and rec'd the modem on Thursday ($5 extra for
UPS Blue Label service.)  As you know, I already have 2 Courier
2400 modems and have been 100% satisfied with them, but I wanted 
to try one of the BT modems - the price looked to good to be true.

The BT2400E (external RS-232C version) is housed in a slimline
plastic enclosure with 8 LEDs on the front and NO hardware DIP
switches - all configuration is done via software.  I was a little
bothered by the lack of the familiar DIP switches until I found
out how easy the modem is to software program - now I don't
miss the DIP switches at all!  The BT2400E modem has more features
than the Couriers (did I say that!) and at a savings of around
$75 - latest mail order price on Courier is $375.00

I have been giving the BT2400E a real work-out the last 3 or
4 days and am happy to report that it works fine at 1200 or 2400
baud to all the systems I have called.  The modem appears to have
good filtering as I have not experienced any more line noise than
I do with the Couriers.  I am using the modem with PibTerm and
ProComm modem programs for the IBM-PC and it's a perfect match.
The only thing you need do is issue an intialization string when
the modem is first brought online.  The default settings have
the DTR and DCD lines ALWAYS HIGH - so for normal modem mode
you need to issue the following string:

                   AT &D2 &S1 &C1 &W <return>

This command tells the modem to respond normally to the flow
control on the DTR line and DCD line and then stores this data
internally in its non-volatile memory.  Configuring a modem via
software is much simpler than changing DIP switches which usually
entails pulling off a faceplate to access the switches.

All in all, I give the BT2400E modem 5 stars out of a possible
5 stars.  The price is great, the delivery is quick, the modem
performs 100% and seems to be very compatible with most other
2400 baud modems, and the supplier (QUBIE) stands behind the 
product with a 30-day money back guarantee of satisfaction.  
How could you lose on a deal like this - you have 30 days to 
try it and see if it meets your needs.

Subject: SQ, CRUNCH, ARC, LBR and vice versa on IBM mainframes

I think there was a misunderstanding in a reply to John Fishers letter about
informations on SQ, CRUNCH,... formats. He seems to have the same problem as
me. We are working on IBM mainframes and want to look at the file we get
from SIMTEL20 before shipping them to our micros. Documentation files can be
printed on high speed printers. There is no need to ship them via telephone
lines to the micros. My question: Is there any software available for IBM
mainframes (not PC's) to do the job? Thanks in advance for any reply.

subject: Need help for turbo-pascal(-bug?)

I have the following problem with a program, using the turbo tool-box
(access system version 1.0) and turbo pascal version 3.00A.
I wrote a program that uses 2 different databases and 4 different
index-files. Sometimes the program runs perfectly. Somtimes, when I only
add a few lines of code, the program crashes immediatly, without coming
to the added code. Sometimes senceless error messages  occur with
filenames made of random characters. Then I switch on the $U+ compiler
option without any other changes on the program and the program perfectly
runs again. It is a mystery for me. I never had any difficulties with
this version of turpo pascal before. All other programs are still running
so it is not the hardware. Is there someone out there who has an idea?
Any, really any, comments are welcome.

Subject: Apple CP/M overlays for BYE5

The following Apple CP/M overlays for BYE5 are now available from
SIMTEL20:

Filename			Type	 Bytes	 CRC

Directory PD:<CPM.BYE5>
B5AA-3.IQS.1			BINARY	  4608  9797H
B5AB-1.IQS.1			BINARY	  8448  88CEH
B5AC-1.IQS.3			BINARY	  2432  3BBAH
B5AS-2.IQS.1			BINARY	  3840  F82EH

B5AA-3.IQS is the BYE5 insert for the Apple ][, ][+, or //e, with PCPI
Applicard Z80 card and Super Serial card. This version corrects the
bug that prevented BYE5 from dropping DTR to hang up the phone when
the caller typed 'BYE'. Tested with Prometheus Promodem with good
results.

B5AB-1.IQS is the BYE5 insert for Apple // with the ALS CP/M+ card and
Super Serial card.

B5AC-1.IQS is the BYE5 insert for the Apple ][, ][+, or //e with the
Microsoft Softcard (or clone) and Applecat plug-in modem card.

B5AS-2.IQS is the BYE5 insert for the Apple ][, ][+, or //e with
Microsoft Softcard (or clone) and Super Serial Card. It probably will
also work on the Apple //c with ZRAM or equivalent Z80 enhancement.
Version 2 corrects the address offset problem and should be fully
functional. Tested on Apple ][+, Softcard, Super Serial card, and
Prometheus Promodem with good results.

The C128 has built-in code to read and write Kaypro II, Kaypro IV,
Osborne Double Density, and some kind of IBM format.  The limit on
this, however, is only the software.  I believe there is at least one
public domain program out there that will set the 1571 drive up for many
different formats.  The 1571 drive has a programmable MFM controller that
can read most of the CP/M formats that have been used once it is properly
set up.  As for software compatibility, the C128 is most compatible with
a Kaypro.  This is basically screen driver compatibiliy, as I've found most
CP/M stuff to be very transportable (Epson stuff is often an exception to
this; they do quite a bit of machine specific things).  The C128 screen
driver is an ADM-31 (or ADM-3A) with a few extensions for color.  Some 
Kaypro machines have a few non-compatible extensions to the ADM standard,
though the latest versions of the C128 BIOS (December '85 or later) are
a bit more Kaypro compatible than the early C128 BIOS was.

You've found a classic problem , which is waht resulted in the Z-80 card
being discontinued.  The original card worked fine on the C64 that it was
designed for.  That machine used a Revision 5 (as I recall) VIC chip.
Later on, the VIC was revised to cure a problem it had with sparkling
characters.  That impacted on total system timing, but no effort was made
to fix the CP/M card.  The result is that if you have a system with a
REV 7 or 8 VIC, you have less than about 50% chance of the CP/M card
working.

Now that RAM chip prices have dropped through the floor ...

Can anyone recommend a cheap board with a huge slug of memory for an
IEEE S-100 system, with memory mapping suitable for CP/M 3?  My CPU
board (a 1978 vintage Ithaca) doesn't do appropriate memory mapping.
In 1983 there was a great little board, with each 4k page independently
mappable, for a couple of grand; seems like it should cost a couple of
hundred by now if still in production.

Subject: Special characters in TOPS-20 filenames

All the files in our collections which were uploaded as-is from
existing collections, such as CPMUG, SIG/M, and PC/BLUE, have
some filenames containing "special characters" as far as our TOPS-20
file system is concerned.  These characters are not considered
"special" by their respective operating systems, but they must be
quoted by prefixing a ^V immediately prior to each such character.

I have scanned our collections, and the following special characters
currently exist in the filenames:

& - ampersand          @ - at sign
/ - slash              + - plus sign
# - pound sign         ^ - caret
% - percent sign       ' - single quote
! - exclamation mark

In general, all punctuation characters are considered special.  When
in doubt, it doesn't hurt to prefix the character with a ^V, except
for the period between the filename and filetype.

Those of you accessing our collections via FTP have already discovered
this ^V prefix requirement.  However, those of you accessing our
system through ARCHIVE-REQUEST may be wondering why you are getting
back "File Not Found" messages.  This ^V prefix requirement is part of
the reason.  The other part is that there is a bug in the runtime
library for the version of the C compiler I am using for the server
and some of the utilities it uses.  The next release should have this
fixed and hopefully I will have figured out how to have the server
automatically insert the ^V prefix where required so that you need not
have to bother remembering to do so.

Where that leaves us at the moment is that files with those special
characters, especially the slash, imbedded in filenames are currently
inaccessible via ARCHIVE-REQUEST.

Subject: AMPRO MULTIFMT utility


     I have a small problem which I hope that those of you out there in
net-land may be able to help me with....

     I have an Ampro LB computer. The BIOS that Ampro supplies with the
machine ( currently v3.8 ) allows reading/writing from approximately sixty
different formats, with a utility included to format about half of them as
well. Problem: I have 2 96-tpi drives... and I need to format a 48-tpi
disk. The read/write routines use something called a "double-step bit" to
enable the 96 track drive to read a 48 track disk. This is done in the
BIOS, and the utilities include an option to set this bit.

     Is there a way to cause the drives to "double-step" so that I can use
the MULTIFMT program, which does *not* include this option? Or is it
impossible? I would appreciate any insights.

Is the mail server that allows remote access to the SIMTEL20 PD archives
working? 

I sent two requests for the info files, one about 10 days ago and the
second about a week ago. I have gotten nothing back - not even an
"addressee unknown" error message. Since I didn't get a message saying
that it was undeliverable, I assume my message got thru to ARCHIVE-REQUEST.

My only suspicion is that the server was not able to correctly extract
a return address for me since the chain of VAX/VMS mail to CSNET phone
mail to ARPANET can produce some bizarre address syntax. 

Can anyone tell me what is going on?

A 96 tpi drive requires a floppy disk designed for 96 tpi (called high
density).  You can format a high density disk to 48 tpi but only on a 96
tpi drive.  Subsequent writes on a 48 tpi drive will be unreliable.

            THE LIBRARIES, ZAS, AND THE SLR ASSEMBLERS -- PART 2

                                  Jay Sage
                             September 11, 1986


                                 Background

     After reading Richard Conn's article on the libraries in Micro/Systems 
Journal (MSJ), I felt that Richard had been highly misleading in his 
statements such as the following:

     SYSLIB Version 3.6 (the most recent version) is written in the 
     ZAS assembler language and can only be assembled by the ZAS 
     assembler (SYSLIB.REL is provided in the distribution, so it is 
     not necessary to be able to assemble SYSLIB in order to use it).
     
This statement and an identical one about Z3LIB Version 1.3 imply that 
anyone who wants to work with the library source code has to go out and buy 
ZAS.  I felt that this impression needed to be corrected, especially where 
(in my opinion) ZAS is at best a mediocre assembler, particularly in 
contrast to the superb assemblers from SLR systems that are available at 
nearly the same price.  I released the file ZAS-SLR.DOC to clarify matters.  
Richard has now released his rebuttal in ZAS-STD.DOC.  While Richard's 
comments in MSJ were merely misleading, some of those in ZAS-STD.DOC could 
well be construed as an affront to what is left of the 8-bit programmer 
community.  More on that a little later.  First I would like to deal 
specifically with Richard's comments in rebuttal to mine.


                       Rebuttal to Richard's Rebuttal

     In Richard's responses to my comments I thought I was reading something 
composed by the State Department -- a lot of semantic sidestepping to 
distract one's attention from the real issue, the misleading statements in 
the MSJ article.

     First Richard corrects me concerning his employment by Echelon.  OK, 
let's use the words "very closely associated, including financially" 
instead.  Actually, I may indeed have been wrong.  I had been told several 
months ago by someone definitely in a position to know that Richard was 
working full time for Echelon.  Perhaps I misunderstood; perhaps things did 
not work out as planned; perhaps the legal relationship is technically not 
employment.  It really doesn't matter.  The real issue is that Richard is 
using ZAS not because he examined a lot of assemblers and found ZAS to be 
the best.  He uses it, I submit, because it is the product promoted by 
Echelon.  AND THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH THAT.  There would also be nothing 
wrong with his being employed by Echelon and supporting his employer by 
using and promoting the employer's products (the fact that Richard makes no 
money directly from the sales of ZAS is irrelevant; I don't make any money 
directly from my employer's sales either).  What is wrong is to promote 
those products in a misleading way.

     Richard pointed gleefully to my admission that SLR's Z80ASM assembler 
could not fully assemble the SYSLIB source as released.  I ask the rest of 
the community out there: Do you think that, in the nearly three hundred 
modules and thousands of lines of code, five lines with ".IN LUDDEF" that 
have to be changed to "INCLUDE LUDDEF.LIB" justify conveying the impression 
that you better go out and buy ZAS if you want to use the source code?  I 
find it very hard to believe that anyone who would know what to do with the 
source code would have any trouble whatsoever converting the source back to 
one of the standard assembler formats.

     Richard states that SLR's Z80ASM cannot assemble the latest Z3LIB 
without completely editing the source (though in the same text he also 
states that he has never seen or used the SLR assembler!).  In fact, Z80ASM 
assembles the latest releases of Z3LIB (1.3) and VLIB (1.1) without any 
problems at all.  Perhaps Richard was referring to a future version of the 
libraries.  Is he planning to make deliberate use of idiosyncrasies of the 
ZAS assembler to make sure that only ZAS can be used?  Even then I am sure 
there would be no serious difficulty in converting the code to a format 
suitable for conventional assemblers.

     To sum all this up, I repeat my previous statement that if Richard had 
said something like "the most recent versions of the libraries are written 
in the ZAS assembler language and might require some minor changes for use 
with other assemblers" I would have had no problem and would not have 
written ZAS-SLR.DOC.


                            Two Technical Asides

     While I was running the code through the SLR assemblers, I decided to 
check my speculation that the libraries contained only 8080-compatible 
opcodes (Richard implied repeatedly in the article that the older releases 
of the libraries were for 8080 but that the current versions were for Z80 
and HD64180 only).  SLR's fancier, virtual-memory assembler Z80ASM+ has an 
option to flag any non-8080 instructions as errors (its further ability to 
flag absolute jumps that could be replaced by relative jumps saved 
significant code in VFILER 4.1).  I ran it on all modules of all three 
libraries.  Only four modules contained any Z80-specific opcodes.  These 
were in the same library-utility modules that have the ZAS-specific ".IN" 
pseudo-ops.  Since these are the newest routines, they suggest that Richard 
is now writing code that will not support 8080- and 8085-based computers.  
This in not a criticism; I also think it is time to start taking advantage 
of the Z80 opcodes.  (The SLR assemblers carry this to a very high degree, 
increasing speed and efficiency by making extensive use of alternate and 
index registers.)  I would leave it to the minority with 8085s to convert 
the source and release 8080 versions of the libraries.

     While I am on asides, let me note another technical shortcoming of the 
coding in the libraries (in ZAS-SLR.DOC I noted a few inconsistencies in 
symbol names).  None of the routines place their uninitialized data space 
into data segments (DSEGs).  As a result, COM files made using the libraries 
include useless bytes that slow down loading and take up extra disk space.  
This has been a problem with all Z programs.  It's not an earthshaking 
matter, but it is completely unnecessary.  VFILER Version 4.1 is the first Z 
program (to my knowledge) where the main program has support for DSEGs.  I 
am now in the process of modifying the libraries code for VFILER.  The 
linking step is more complicated (except with SLR's virtual-memory linker 
SLRNK+, which does it automatically), requiring two linking operations, one 
to determine the end of the program space (CSEG) and a second one to perform 
the linkage with the data space ORGed immediately after the program space.  
With SLRNK this is no big deal, since it will perform two linkages in less 
time than other linkers can do one.  And during development there is no need 
to place the data space precisely at the end of the code space.


                     The Standard for 8-Bit Assemblers

     Now I turn my attention to the part of Richard's ZAS-STD.DOC that I 
feel is a real chutzpah.  In that file we learn that Richard Conn (King 
Richard, perhaps) has decreed a new standard for assembly language that we 
all must follow if we want to be a part of the Z programming community.  He 
argues very eloquently and convincingly for the value of standards, pointing 
to the example of Ada, his other major interest.

     I, too, place a high value on standards, especially when they are a 
help to everyone.  But consider how standards are usually arrived at in a 
democratic society.  Several steps are involved:

    1.  Notice is given to the community that a standard is being 
        considered;
    
    2.  A committee of experts and interested parties is formed to 
        oversee the development of the standard;
    
    3.  Existing products are examined, studied, and evaluated;
    
    4.  Input is solicited from the community at large.
    
     Richard Conn, as far as I can tell, has done none of these things!  
First, the announcement of "The ZAS Standard" in ZAS-STD.DOC fell like a 
bombshell.  I have not seen any notice in Z-News or on Z-Node Central of the 
intention to formulate and enforce an assembler standard.  There is a BIG 
difference between ZAS as the only assembler sold and supported by Echelon 
and ZAS as THE STANDARD assembler.  Any company may choose to market a 
particular product, but only IBM then declares it to be a world standard 
(actually, even IBM doesn't do that; their choice just becomes the de facto 
standard).

     Second, there has been no committee of experts, at least not a public 
one.  Richard Conn, perhaps with others on the "Echelon Team", seems to have 
appointed himself.  Does Echelon really think it is the IBM of the 8-bit 
world?!

     Third, from Richard's own text we see that no examination of existing 
products has been conducted.  He states plainly in that text that he has 
never seen the SLR assemblers.  Anyone who keeps himself at all informed 
about activities in the computer world other than his own would surely have 
noticed the advertisements for the SLR tools.  The utterly outrageous (but 
true!) claims in those ads should have at least led a standards setter to 
investigate.

     Fourth, since the community was not even notified of an impending 
standard, its input was neither solicited nor given consideration.  We have 
been presented with a fait accompli.  I, and I am sure others, would like to 
ask that Richard Conn show some genuine respect for the rest of the 8-bit 
programming community by paying a little attention to our ideas in addition 
to his own.  That means not only listening to us when we talk directly to 
him but more importantly looking at the new programs and program 
enhancements that we release and at the dialogue on Z-Node Central and the 
other Z-Nodes.  And it also means actively soliciting input before he makes 
decisions that he expects the whole community to follow.

     Richard's actions would be open to criticism even if the standard 
decreed for us were a good one, but it is not.  When Echelon first offered 
ZAS, many of us in the community wanted to and tried to support it.  
Unfortunately, we found it to be a very mediocre assembler plagued with a 
continuing series of problems and deficiencies (I don't want to go into them 
here).  I have reached the point where I am no longer willing to expend the 
effort to check my code for ZAS compatibility; Joe Wright, a member (or 
former member?) of the Echelon Team, has even consented to be quoted in the 
SLR advertisements (I would, too).

     It is with regret that I make the above statements about ZAS.  In 
general, the Echelon product line is a superb one that lives up to Echelon's 
image of excellence.  Many of the products (the DSD debugger and REVAS3 
disassembler) are, I think, the best available.  Joe Wright's auto-install Z 
System packages are marvels of ingenuity; ZRDOS offers excellent new 
functionality; ZCPR3 itself, the centerpiece, is dazzling.  ZAS, 
unfortunately, stands out like a sore thumb in this list.  When I first used 
the SLR assemblers, my immediate reaction was: There are the assemblers that 
belong in the Echelon product line!


                              A Silver Lining

     There is a silver lining I am happy to report.  Yesterday Richard sent 
a message over the INFO-CPM mailing list on the Defense Data Network (ARPA-
NET), where our previous round of files also appeared, noting that he had 
just received copies of the SLR assemblers and, though he had not yet used 
them, was impressed with them based on the documentation.  He also reported 
that Echelon and SLR Systems are talking.  Perhaps this false start at 
standard-setting will be set aright, and we will all benefit.


                               Final Footnote

     Lest anyone take the above remarks excessively seriously, I would like 
to temper them by adding that under circumstances such as these I am given 
to a degree of overstatement.  After all, with nothing but a steady stream 
of superb new Z programs week after week, one looks for something to break 
the monotony.  And why should Frank Gaude' with his Z-News be the only one
to provide some color?  Of course, Frank's style and mine are not exactly
the same, and I prefer Cabernet Sauvignon to Zinfandel.

Subject:  Let's "mellow out" a bit!

Fellow CP/Mers - I have been reading with interest but also with growing
concern the exchange of messages between Jay Sage and Rick Conn concerning
Rick's adoption of the ZAS assembler as a "standard" for his further develop-
ment of ZCPR and related software.  The "discussion" started off a bit on the
"edgy" side, but it is now rapidly approaching nasty.  This is a real shame,
because Jay is generally raising reasonable questions of interest to many of
us, and I for one would like to hear the answers.  But having witnessed one
p___ing contest on this list already (it was about a modem program, a couple
years ago), I definitely don't want to see that happen again.

     In my opinion, Rick Conn DOESN'T OWE US ANYTHING!  He has created and
donated free of cost an ENORMOUS software suite that takes about 5 megabytes
of storage in the archive.  This is the result of several years of work,
and it still boggles me that Rick has GIVEN IT AWAY.  Just reading through the
pounds of well written documentation seems to take forever!  So if Rick wants
to standardize on the ZAS assembler (or COBOL, or SNAFU, or whatever), it's
entirely his business, and I don't think we have any RIGHTS in the matter.
Rick may possibly do some things that will cut off part of the community who
are currently enjoying his efforts, and that will be sad.  I don't think this
has happened yet, but if it does, I hope to see some messages in this forum
seeking a compromise solution.  I also hope such messages will be courteous
and respectful.  After all, even the creator of 5 megabytes of first class
free software can screw up occasionally!

     So let's continue to explore the new directions Rick's efforts are
taking.  If Rick says some things that seem inaccurate or that we don't
understand, let's ask him about them.  But let's also remember that Rick isn't
a one-man benevolent society.  He is not our servant.  Even if we strongly
disagree with what he is saying, let's be graceful about it.

     Let's mellow out a bit, PLEASE!

take exception to Rick Conn's choice, then let them blaze the

I have just completed a simple MIDI interface for the Otrona Attache.
I have tested it with my Ensoniq ESQ-1, but it should work with anything else...
If anyone out there is interested, drop me a note.

NOTE:  This is just the hardware part; the software part should keep me
busy for quite a while :-)

My thanks, too!  However, being a relatively new subscriber to the group, I 
only know of the existence of this boon, and not how to take advantage of
it.  Perhaps it was in a message I didn't read closely enough because
I didn't know what I had, but  ...

Would it be possible for someone to post again how someone can take
advantage of the SIMTEL20 archives?  What kind of account is needed, and
where, and how to know what to order, etc.

I apologize if this produces tedious net.mail for others, but I would sure
appreciate some assistance here.

Subject: Recent changes to the Archive Server

For those of you who missed the announcement, send a message to
ARCHIVE-REQUEST@SIMTEL20 which contains the one line: SEND INFO
in the message body.  Please do not send to ARCHIVE-SERVER via your
reply mechanism as it ends up in my mailbox and delays processing of
your requests.

I have made a couple of changes in the Server.  The first is that you
will no longer need to remember to quote certain characters in
filenames which are "special" characters to TOPS-20.  The Server now
does that for you, except for the slash ("/") character, and I expect
that to be fixed shortly.  (That means that any file with a slash in
the filename will show up as Not Found for now.)

The second change is to block certain extremely large files from being
processed in their original form.  These files are available from
other sources, as are most of the files we keep here.

In the two weeks since the availability of this service was announced,
we have processed just over 2,800 requests.  About 200 of those were
requests for the basic HELP, INFO, and BOOTSTRAP files.  About 260
were for filenames that didn't exist for one reason or another, and
about 300 resulted in multi-part replies.  The remaining 2,100
requests were answered with one message file in reply.  Of those, only
200 were for directory listings; the remaining 1,900 requests were for
actual files.

This is certainly a very active rate, and far greater than I
anticipated.  But, then again, I had no way to even guess the rate.
We seem to be able to tolerate the additional load to a point.
However, I still am considering a less responsive frequency and push
the processing back to nights and weekends.  This may happen without
warning, especially after other groups receive the notice that this
service is available...

Subject: Technical Information for ARC files

ARC-FILE.INF, created by Keith Petersen, W8SDZ, 21-Sep-86, extracted
from UNARC.INF by Robert A. Freed.

From:     Robert A. Freed
Subject:  Technical Information for ARC files
Date:     June 24, 1986

Note: In the following discussion, UNARC refers to my CP/M-80 program
for extracting files from MSDOS ARCs.  The definitions of the ARC file
format are based on MSDOS ARC512.EXE.

ARCHIVE FILE FORMAT
-------------------

Component files are stored sequentially within an archive.  Each entry
is preceded by a 29-byte header, which contains the directory
information.  There is no wasted space between entries.  (This is in
contrast to the centralized directory used by Novosielski libraries.
Although random access to subfiles within an archive can be noticeably
slower than with libraries, archives do have the advantage of not
requiring pre-allocation of directory space.)

Archive entries are normally maintained in sorted name order.  The
format of the 29-byte archive header is as follows:

Byte 1:  1A Hex.
         This marks the start of an archive header.  If this byte is not found 
         when expected, UNARC will scan forward in the file (up to 64K bytes) 
         in an attempt to find it (followed by a valid compression version).  
         If a valid header is found in this manner, a warning message is 
         issued and archive file processing continues.  Otherwise, the file is 
         assumed to be an invalid archive and processing is aborted.  (This is 
         compatible with MS-DOS ARC version 5.12).  Note that a special 
         exception is made at the beginning of an archive file, to accomodate 
         "self-unpacking" archives (see below).

Byte 2:  Compression version, as follows:

         0 = end of file marker (remaining bytes not present)
         1 = unpacked (obsolete)
         2 = unpacked
         3 = packed
         4 = squeezed (after packing)
         5 = crunched (obsolete)
         6 = crunched (after packing) (obsolete)
         7 = crunched (after packing, using faster hash algorithm) (obsolete)
         8 = crunched (after packing, using dynamic LZW variations)

Bytes 3-15:  ASCII file name, nul-terminated.

(All of the following numeric values are stored low-byte first.)

Bytes 16-19:  Compressed file size in bytes.

Bytes 20-21:  File date, in 16-bit MS-DOS format:
              Bits 15:9 = year - 1980
              Bits  8:5 = month of year
              Bits  4:0 = day of month
              (All zero means no date.)

Bytes 22-23:  File time, in 16-bit MS-DOS format:
              Bits 15:11 = hour (24-hour clock)
              Bits 10:5  = minute
              Bits  4:0  = second/2 (not displayed by UNARC)

Bytes 24-25:  Cyclic redundancy check (CRC) value (see below).

Bytes 26-29:  Original (uncompressed) file length in bytes.
              (This field is not present for version 1 entries, byte 2 = 1.  
              I.e., in this case the header is only 25 bytes long.  Because 
              version 1 files are uncompressed, the value normally found in 
              this field may be obtained from bytes 16-19.)


SELF-UNPACKING ARCHIVES
-----------------------

A "self-unpacking" archive is one which can be renamed to a .COM file
and executed as a program.  An example of such a file is the MS-DOS
program ARC512.COM, which is a standard archive file preceded by a
three-byte jump instruction.  The first entry in this file is a simple
"bootstrap" program in uncompressed form, which loads the subfile
ARC.EXE (also uncompressed) into memory and passes control to it.  In
anticipation of a similar scheme for future distribution of UNARC, the
program permits up to three bytes to precede the first header in an
archive file (with no error message).


CRC COMPUTATION
---------------

Archive files use a 16-bit cyclic redundancy check (CRC) for error
control.  The particular CRC polynomial used is x^16 + x^15 + x^2 + 1,
which is commonly known as "CRC-16" and is used in many data
transmission protocols (e.g. DEC DDCMP and IBM BSC), as well as by
most floppy disk controllers.  Note that this differs from the CCITT
polynomial (x^16 + x^12 + x^5 + 1), which is used by the XMODEM-CRC
protocol and the public domain CHEK program (although these do not
adhere strictly to the CCITT standard).  The MS-DOS ARC program does
perform a mathematically sound and accurate CRC calculation.  (We
mention this because it contrasts with some unfortunately popular
public domain programs we have witnessed, which from time immemorial
have based their calculation on an obscure magazine article which
contained a typographical error!)

Additional note (while we are on the subject of CRC's): The validity
of using a 16-bit CRC for checking an entire file is somewhat
questionable.  Many people quote the statistics related to these
functions (e.g. "all two-bit errors, all single burst errors of 16 or
fewer bits, 99.997% of all single 17-bit burst errors, etc."), without
realizing that these claims are valid only if the total number of bits
checked is less than 32767 (which is why they are used in small-packet
data transmission protocols).  I.e., for file sizes in excess of about
4K bytes, a 16-bit CRC is not really as good as what is often claimed.
This is not to say that it is bad, but there are more reliable methods
available (e.g. the 32-bit AUTODIN-II polynomial).  (End of lecture!)

I've had the same problem over here.  I was almost ready to give up on my 
request when a reply from it came through.  The final turnaround
time was OVER 10 days.  I have yet to receive a reply from 3 other
requests I sent in only hours after I sent my first request.  Is the
network really this slow?????  The only advice I have is wait (thats
what I'm still doing).

Z-System is the name of the CP/M-replacement operating system from
Echelon, Inc.  It uses Richard Conn's ZCPR3 for the command processor
and Dennis Wright's ZRDOS disk operating system (replaces the BDOS).  This
is the state-of-the-art operating system for Z80 (and NS800 and HD64180
and even 8080 or 8085) computers.  If you are not using it, you should
definitely look into it.

with it.

Subject: Writing 48 tpi on 96 tpi drives
Cc: kenny

We've been through this several times before... and I am already seeing the
incorrect explanations of the compatibility problems between 48 tpi and
96 tpi drives flying.  Here's a legitimate, simplified explanation.
Please feel free to repost to the whole net if you see enough wrong
ones go by (I've only seen two so far).

The 96 tpi drives place two tracks in the space where a 48 tpi drive
puts one:

		48 TPI				96 TPI
------------------------------------------------------------------------

################################|################################
################################|################################
################################|
################################|################################
################################|################################
                                |
################################|################################
################################|################################
################################|
################################|################################
################################|################################

				etc.

A 96 TPI drive can easily read a 48 TPI disk.  The narrow head sits in
the wide track
######## like ##############################
######## this ##############################
############################################ or
################################ like ######
################################ this ######

and has no problems picking up the data.  The problem comes when a 96
tpi drive WRITES a 48 tpi disk.  If the disk is truly blank and
unformatted, the 96 TPI head will write its narrow track and the 48 TPI
can read it because there isn't anything else there to read:

############################## +----+
############################## |    |
                               |wide|
                               |head|
                               +----+

But, if there's ANY data on the disk (say, for example, that the disk
was formatted on a 48 TPI machine), then when the 96 TPI drive writes
it, we'll have something like
                                +----+
################################|head|$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
################################+----+$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
######################################################################
######################################################################
######################################################################

so that two different streams of data appear in the area that the 48
TPI head will read.  When the 48 TPI disk reads the data, it'll see
some sort of bizarre average of the two and get read errors.  (Don't
flame, physicists and those who understand the recording format.  I
SAID this was a simplified explanation).

Reformatting the disk on either style of drive won't help.  Nor will
duplicating the data on both half-tracks; they won't be precisely in
sync.  The only thing that can be done to REwrite a 48tpi disc on a
96tpi drive is run the whole shebang through a bulk degausser so that
you again have a blank, truly blank disk.

The degaussing is recommended in any case, since discs received from
the manufacturer sometimes have test patterns left on them and aren't
truly blank.

Most 96tpi manufacturers don't want to contend with these issues, so
they simply specify that you can read, but not write.

Like Bob Haar (article <3820@brl-smoke.ARPA>), I too sent a request for the
INFO files to the SIMTEL20 PD archives, and received nothing in response.
Any suggestions as to what happened and how to get around it would be
appreciated.  Am I correct in suspecting that there will be a large number
of people who have experienced this problem?  If there's a problem with
working out return addresses, then is it possible that most or all people
who request information from the UK will also have this problem?

Subject: Archive Server response

The Archive Server program looks for a Reply-To: line, and if it
exists, it extracts, as-is, an address to use for the To: line in its
replies.  If the Reply-To: line is not found, then it uses the From:
line, if it exists.  If the From: line is not found, it logs the event
and proceeds to the next request message.  This is exactly the same
mechanism used by the Reply command of many user mail handler
programs.  In any event, the extracted return address is
case-preserved and no address conversion whatsoever is done.  Our
mailer, on the other hand, will convert the host name on the right of
the atsign to the Official Host Name IN THE ENVELOPE, not the header,
if the host name is found to be an alias.  This conversion has not
been the source of any of the problems seen so far.

Most of the problems in getting the mail out of here stem from a
rather severe congestion problem on the ARPANET side of DDN which has
been going on for the past two weeks.  This has been impacting replies
to be sent through CSNET-RELAY and WISCVM in particular.

Our mailer tries to send a message immediately, and failing that first
try, puts the message in a queue.  Failures are typically "Cannot
connect to host," which may mean that the host is not up or the host
is up but does not respond to a connection request within the
two-minute timeout window.

The mailer then attempts to send each message in that queue once an
hour for the next three days.  Notices are sent to the sender (me in
this case) when the message has not been sent after the first 24 and
then 48 hours.  After 36 hourly attempts, the failed message is sent
back to the sender (me) and I discard it.

However, if the message gets out of here, then the next bottleneck
would be at the gateway host or some intermediate site on the other
side of that host.  Sometimes even those eventually come back as
undeliverable because some host in the return address didn't exist or
did not respond in the timeout window.  Those get tossed too.

That's the way it is; it probably isn't going to get any better, and
may get a lot worse.

Of course it didn't help matters any that we had a severe head crash
on our boot disk early Friday morning and did not come back up until
late Saturday afternoon.  Messages scheduled to be timeout in that
period had one more chance when we came back up and then were returned
to sender.  Lenthy outages such as that one are very rare and the
missed attempts an unfortunate side-effect.  But, timeouts are the
only way to maintain sanity in our queues.

As for the server process itself, it appears that I will have to place
a limit on how many requests will be honored in any one message.  I
didn't place one because I thought people would be reasonable - I was
wrong.  The limit will be five (5) request lines in any one request
message, with the remainder ignored, probably with an appropriate
message.  Also, processing of requests will be suspended during prime
time on Fridays while we run our full backups.

Re:   Getting P2DOS running on H89

     The basic problem I had with P2DOS stems from an error in the
support utilities provided in the distribution.  Somewhere during the
steps to relocate the .REL file the resulting .COM file grows to be
larger than 0E00h bytes.  I was zapping zeroes on top of the BIOS
when trying to overlay the BDOS.  At any rate,  LOAD/SAVE 14 resolves
the problem by shrinking the .COM file to its correct size.

     There is one other problem I encountered that is specific to
the H89's BIOS implementation.  P2DOS, as distributed, uses 0040h
and following for its file search path table.  0040ff has been
reserved by DRI for BIOS, not BDOS usage.  The Heath BIOS uses
that area for its logical/physical drive map.  So, either disable
the feature in P2DOS, or move it somewhere else.  (There is room
in P2DOS itself for it.  When I get some time, I'm going to try
it there).

     At this time I have it running just fine with the path
feature disabled.  I'm using it with ZCPR (as in ZCPR1) so the
path feature is only partly missing.

        I have recieved several requests for  information  regarding
        the creation of MFM-formatted disks using the Commodore 1571
        disk drive.  Hopefully this is enough to get you started.  A
        new FORMAT.COM file for C128 CP/M 3.0  should  be  available
        pretty soon-  watch your favorite BBS for it.

        Please refer to the 1571 Disk Drive User's Guide, Appendix G,
        page 101, for a complete description of the FORMAT MFM  burst
        command. The table below contains the data required to create
        a particular MFM disk format.  MD  and SS are given as binary
        values; the rest are decimal:


                 FMT         MD         SS      IL   N    LT   NS

             Epson QX10   01100110   10000001   0    2    39   10

             Osborne DD   01000110   10000001   0    3    39   5

             Kaypro II    01000110   10000000   0    2    39   10

             Kaypro IV    01010110   10001010   0    2    39   10

             IBM SS       01000110   10000001   0    2    39   8

             IBM DS       01100110   10000001   0    2    39   8



                MD   is the Mode                      byte 2
                SS   is the Starting Sector number         3
                IL   is the Interleave                     4
                N    is the Sector Size                    5
                LT   is the Last Track number              6
                NS   is the Number of Sectors              7



        The following BASIC program  demonstrates  how  a  FORMAT MFM
        command can be sent to a 1571 drive:

     10 OPEN  15,8,15
     20 PRINT#15,"U0"+CHR$(102)+CHR$(129)+CHR$(0)+CHR$(2)+CHR$(39)+CHR$(10)
     30 CLOSE 15

        The example above formats the disk in unit #8 using the Epson
        parameters.  Of course, you must still install the  necessary
        boot and directory sectors to make your DOS (CP/M) happy. The
        higher-level 1571 DOS commands,  such as Load, Save, and Dir,
        will never be happy with non-Commodore formats,  needless  to
        say, right?

I have no trouble downloading using MODEM on TOPS-20 to download when
I talk directly on a dial-up line to the TOPS-20 machine.

My problem is that when I attempt to download through the TAC, I get
the message "bad header in record 1", "bad header in record 2", etc
until my MODM700 program quits on me.

Any suggestions?

Thanks.

Subject: Automatic disk logging

     I want to add automatic disk logging to my BDOS ( P2DOS ), but I'm not
sure about how to go about it. So far, I've produced some very wrird behavior
patterns from the BDOS, but no success.

     I think what needs to be done is for BDOS to check each drive's status
upon it's selection, and reset it if it is R/O.

     Any comments or help would be greatly appreciated.

sounds like the TAC is in 7-bit ASCII mode, rather than binary.  Have
you tried B I S and B O S (I think those are the commands)?  They should
cause the TAC to go into binary mode with eight-bit characters (the
complemented count in the header is 8-bits, even if everything else is
only 7 bits).

    Good luck

In-reply-to: Msg of 25 Sep 1986  16:50-MDT from Mike Barker <mbarker at bbnccv.ARPA>

Both MODEM and the newer TMODEM have code for two methods of
negotiating network binary mode for the TAC user for the duration of
the file transfer on TOPS-20 systems.  One method assumes that the
monitor does not double the IAC character (FFH) and thus allows the
user program to send the appropriate sequences in-band to the TAC.
The other method assumes that the monitor always doubles the IAC
character and provides a particular monitor call to provide the
capability to do that negotiation.

The problem is that some monitors double the IAC character always, but
have no local mod to provide the capability to turn on network binary
mode.  Thus, as Mike says, the user must give the TAC commands:

@B O S
@B I S

in that order.  The side effect of the @B I S is that the user can no
longer give any more TAC commands for the remainder of the session
with that host.  (When the host closes the connection after the user
logs out, the TAC port is set back to normal.)

The situation is further complicated in that neither the MODEM nor
TMODEM program{ have compilation conditionals to allow for this third
case where the monitor does the IAC doubling, but does not provide for
a monitor call.  The solution in those cases is to send this message
to your system wizard and have them contact me to work out a fix.

Subject: Automatic Disk Logging
To: info-cpm@AMSAA.ARPA
Message-ID: <SAGE.26936916@LL.ARPA>

I have not really thought through the question of how one would make
the disk operating system (DOS) perform automatic disk logging, but I do
not think that it is sufficient or necessary to simply check for which
disks are set to read-only status.  First of all, the user may have set
a disk to R/O status (using STAT or another utility), and that diskette
may not have been changed.  In fact, relogging that diskette would
defeat the purpose behind the user's setting it to R/O status, i.e., to
prevent any writing to that diskette.  Secondly, after a diskette is
swapped without resetting with a control-c, the diskette is not yet
marked as read-only.
 
I think that what has to be done is the following.  Whenever DOS is
asked to write to a disk, it must check the allocation table implied by
the directory on the diskette with the allocation table stored in the
BIOS.  If the diskette has not been swapped, the two tables will agree;
if they have been swapped chances are very high that they will not
agree.  The standard Digital Research BDOS does this, and if it finds
that the tables do not agree, it then sets the disk status to read-only,
which precipitates the "BDOS ERROR: DISK R/O" error message.  If you
want the DOS to log in the swapped disk, you must take a more complex
action at this point.
 
I am sure that the required actions to handle this situation are
more complex than meets the eye.  If you want to try hacking, have fun!
I would start by adding code to log in the new disk in such a way that
the write operation can then proceed.  Good luck.  If you simply want
this very nice capability in your system, I strongly recommend that you
look into purchasing ZRDOS from Echelon, Inc. (415-948-3820).  Although
ZRDOS is the DOS used with the Echelon Z operating system, ZRDOS can be
used as the DOS in a standard CP/M2.2 system as well (it does require a
Z80 or compatible microprocessor).  ZRDOS offers quite a few nice
features in addition to automatic disk logging, and I am sure that
Echelon will be happy to send you more detailed information.  As good as
ZRDOS is, by the way, it still cannot handle all disk-swap situations.
I believe that it has trouble, at least on some systems that support
automatic recognition of multiple disk formats, when the swapped
diskette has a different format, such as when you remove a Kaypro SSDD
diskette and put in an Ampro DSDD diskette.  I say all this as an
indication that automatic disk logging is not as easy as one might think
at first.  ZRDOS has gone through a lot of development to get to the
point it is at now.

CP/M 3.0 (A.K.A. CP/M-Plus) does automatic disk logging as a matter of course.
It does this two ways - first by comparing the allocation tables of the disk
and BIOS, as suggested by Mr. Sage, and secondly, if operating with a drive
that can detect disk removal/insertion (by interruptions of the write-lock
photocell), by using that information.  And as Mr. Sage suggests, there are
some problems when swapping formats (this, on a C-128/1571 CP/M system), but
it largely works just fine.  C-128 CP/M 3.0 supports a virtual drive (E:), and
as expected, disk swaps to honor requests for the virtual drive do not trigger
the automatic logging.

From: bridger@RAND-UNIX.ARPA

A slight correction to the discussion: the Digital Research CP/M 2.2
BDOS computes a checksum of each directory sector when it logs in a
new disk (unless cks=0 in the disk parameter block).  When a disk
directory sector is read, it is these stored checksums, not the
bitmap of allocated disk groups, that are compared with the values
computed from the (possibly changed) disk.

Writing to a file causes the allocation map (in memory) and the
user-supplied file control block to be updated, and causes the data
to be written to the disk sectors (when the bios flushes the host
buffer); it does not alter the disk directory.  The directory
information -- which groups are allocated to which files -- is only
updated on the disk when a file (or one extent of a file) is closed.

Auto-logging DOS's usually can't totally prevent trashing a disk.
Suppose that a program creates a file and writes to it, leaving it
open, and the user then swaps in a different disk.  The dos won't
detect the change until the program causes a directory access.  So,
if the program continues to write to the file, the data will go onto
the new disk, overwriting whatever is in those groups; the R/O error
will occur at the close (or other directory operation).

Perhaps the original question -- "auto-logging of disks" -- was
really a query about a BIOS operation (as Jay has suggested).  A
well-designed bios will do a media-determination check whenever
SELDSK is called with bit 0 of register E RESET (e.g. E = 0 or 2) and
will set the dph and associated dpb accordingly for
sides/density/format ...  CP/M 2.2 calls SELDSK with E bit 0 reset
after a ^C and when next selecting a disk that has been logged off.

Of course, only some of the 100+ 5 1/4" formats can be distinguished
by their format pattern.  Bioses that support "foreign" formats may
do so automatically (within the supported subset); others may simply
provide a different logical drive and require the user to install the
dpb/dph information before using it.  For example, it is possible to
set the Advent/Plu*Perfect Systems Turborom on a Kaypro so that the
bios automatically distinguishes Kaypro DSDD 512 format from Ampro
DSDD 512.

*BIOS-level* auto-disk format determination should be compatible with
any cp/m 2.2-type dos, requiring only ^C, reset, or logoff/logon at
the dos level.

I have it on good authority that none exists.  Apple used such a hardware
dependent system that the best way to read an Apple disk, is to use an Apple
Z80 system and pip it over.

What appled did was put the alignment marks on the disk as written bytes,
and so the controller has to track those codes to read the disk.
I suppose it could be done, but I been told it's VERY hard.

I know there is someone making an expansion card for the IBMPC that
allows it to read Apple formats.  I don't remember the name of the
company, but it's one of the "regular" IBM expansion card makers.
Since neither the PC nor the Apple are up my alley, I probably wouldn't
normally remember this, but there's a business here in town that does
a brisk trade in translating disks via one of these cards.
