NOTE!!
The official release version of QTERM is either QTERM41D.LBR, or if your
system crunches IX and IY try to find QTERM41E.LBR. When I get off my

Any previous version will probably be missing features (especially
if you've got a 4.0x version).

I agree with the cost vs. speed arguement, but I wonder how fast a 6 MHz
Z80 really is.  The Microsoft Softcard runs at 3.58 MHz, not 1 MHz, and
that just barely gets it up to the speed of the 1 MHz 6502.  I started
here at Microsoft after the Softcard had fizzled out, so I'm no expert on
our product.  In fact, I actually have a Taiwan peripheral clone of the
Softcard.  But I have looked into the architecture, and a Z80 takes three
cycles to transfer a byte, where the 6502 takes one.  Add to that the
restriction that the video generator uses every other half cycle at 1 MHz
to read video RAM, and then you'll see why the Softcard would see a lot of
RAM wait states when accessing main Apple memory.  When the phase 1 Apple
clock is low, the Z80 sees a clock low for 500ns, then when phase 1 is
high, the Z80 sees a few quick bursts at 3.58 MHz, but then it stops again
when phase 1 goes low again.  I think the Softcard //e is a little faster
because of the on-board 64K which is not restricted to video timing (but
is unusable as //e aux memory).  So, depending upon whether the Applicard
has its own independant memory bus (to remove the video wait states), it
might not actually be running at a full 6 MHz.  Even if it is, its not 6
times faster than the Microsoft (or AE) card - more like twice (at best).

BTW, if the Applicard comes with any documentation or schematics which
diagram its operation, I would be curious to hear how it does interface to
the Apple.  I'm always looking for the better mousetrap.

I have two of the Applicards, both running at 6 Mhz.  Both have a full
64K of memory and I think both allow a 62K TPA.  Device drivers are
normally written in 6502 and thus allows the best of both worlds, that is,
full utilization of both busses.  One of the two boards has a 128k
memory expansion on it, with a ramdisk driver as one of the driver
devices.  I don't know how any of it is configured.  Terminal screen
update when the Applicard is about twice as fast as ordinarily when
Wordstar is running, but I think this is probably limited just by the
data transfer to the Apple bus (never measured explicitly, just
subjective memory).  Also I have a very slow video card (ALS Smarterm I..
my Smarterm II blew out, TWICE, and it is now being used to support a
sagging table leg.)  If I had some kinda benchmark program for CP/M,
the relative performance of the on-the-board stuff could probably be
checked.  But then, I dont think PCPI is still making/supporting them
so its probably all academic.  We who have em get the performance and
nobody else can get em.

I once responded to someone who posted a message that they wanted to
buy one of 'em from me, and the offer that was returned was "$75, but
only if it includes the 128K ram card and all of the technical documentation
that you have --- oh yeah, and the hard disk driver software too."
Well, I did not sell it after all, ya see, cause it was $200. for
the card, $250 for the extra memory and $150 for the hard disk driver
that somebody wrote, and then there was the two $50. upgrades to PCPI
for versions 1.5 and 2.0 of the system software.  Nah, he could buy a
clone of the Microsoft card with no system software at all from a local swap
meet, or he could add a grand total of $16 to that and get the world.
I think not.

I asked a friend of mine who has a Z89 and he says that the hardware
is capable of either hard or soft, it's all in the BIOS, which is on the
system tracks of the boot disk.  IOW, to "convert" his machine to a
soft-sectored machine, simply get your hands on a soft-sectored boot
disk, and do it.  Is there a HUG around there somewhere?  (Heathkit
User Group)  Most Heath stores sponsor them or at least know of them.

The original H89 design put ROM at location 0, and a special CP/M was
created which could accommodate this.  (The same hack was used on the
TRS-80 model III.)  Standard CP/M binaries will not work on such a
system.

There was a mod to the H89 later which made the ROM shadow-able and put
RAM at 0.  Before you spend a lot of time moving your software onto H89
disks, you might as well find out if it has the mod.

There is the Heath User Group, who distributes a fair amount of
stuff in hard-sector format.  The _only_ other option is to 
hook up a serial link (preferably at 9600+).  My tertiary 
system is a Micropolis-based machine, 16-sector, 77 tracks,
SSQD, 315K per disk.  It doesn't have a whole lot, since I
have never managed to get a serial port to cuntion with the 
odd system clock I have on the CPU (1.8432MHz - most S100
systems demand a 2 MHz clock for a serial port).

Actually, as late as three years ago, you could have gone to a
Heathkit store for conversion.  A lot of them had -89's with 
two controllers in them.  One of his options is to add a second
disk controller (soft-sectored, of course), which will give him
a bit more storage to boot.  So I misspoke.  There are some options.

This is not true.   The drive is pretty much the standard 5 1/4" drive
(of that day), but the controller is completely different.
Heath/Zenith and a number of third party suppliers sold soft-sector
controllers (called H37 format), but I'm not aware that any of these
would also do hard sector (though I guess that could be possible).  Many
people had both hard sector and soft sector drives on H-89s.

You either need to move stuff between the machines the with the serial
lines or install a soft sector controller in the 89 (not too easy to
find now).  

HUG sell (for about $15) a package that allows a PC to emulate an 89.
This includes a pretty nice utility for moving stuff between them with
the serial lines.

Brian,
  I have run a PCPI card as well as a Softcard and was impressed by
both at one time or other.  I feel that the PCPI card had more
flexibility than the Softcard.  There were more configuration options
for the PCPI card which helps alot when there are no BIOSs available
for either.  Getting back to your question, it has been a while since
I have written much for the PCPI card but here goes.

  The Z80 and the 6502 run on two completely different clock cycles.
tThe Z80 can run up to the board and memory access limit and not be
directly affected by the 6502 chugging along at 1M.  However, all I/O
is performed by the 6502; thus reducing throughput on I/O bound
processes.  The bios, from the Z80 side, is a bunch of routines that
pass command words and blocks of data to the 6502 via a Z80 I/O port.
Several Zilog ports are used, some for data and some for status of the
data ports.  From the 6502 side, interrupts are generated and the
commands and data are memory mapped to I/O locations in the Apple I/O
slot address space depending on the location of the card.  Development
of I/O drivers requires, in many cases, both Z80 and 6502 assembler
programming.  The interface is "slick" because there is no need to rush
to read data from the port if you write your dirvers properly; let the
Apple buffer the data (it will use all the memory you have installed)
and read it at your leasure. 6502 interupts are generated for both read
and written data to the channel port between the 6502 and the Z80.

  I hope this answers your questions, if not let me know.

The 1.8432 is a magic number for one of the older baud reate generator chips -
a motorola I think.  You might want to check the data books.

A friend of mine has a Z89 with one controller and he can boot it either way.
The hard/soft distinction is in the BIOS, and that's on the system tracks.

Subject: New CP/M mail server

A copy of RNA (a very simple archive server) has been installed on
lakart.UUCP, to allow access to CP/M software that I have written
(sorry, I can't archive everything on SIMTEL20, we only have 1/2 a
Gig here :-) ).

To access it, I'd suggest starting by getting help and index, although
I can summarise the index as it currently stands:

qterm:	qterm V4.1e - the latest and greatest
zsm:	zsm V2.3 - will come in handy for patching qterm

OK, so it's only two files. However in the near future, two others
will be appearing:

qtermp:	patches for qterm - not too many, but it's a start
z80ccp:	my revised z80 CCP

and yet more as time progresses.

To access this server send mail containing the following:

/send whatever to address

to rna@lakart.UUCP. whatever is what you want to get, so to get help and
index you'd say:

/send index to address
/send help to address

Since RNA is about as thick as two short planks, I'll give some hints
for addresses:

Mapped uucp sites (i.e. ones that pathalias knows about) should simply
provide: host!user or user@host.uucp - lakart can route to these.

Ghost uucp sites (ones that pathalias doesn't know about) should provide
a bang path from a backbone site, again by routing to the backbone it'll
get there.

Domain addressed sites should simply provide a user@host.domain type address:
it will be forwarded to a gateway for subsequent delivery.

To reach lakart, use the addresses below, and I'll also go in and hack the
headers later to make this appear to come from rna (rather than dg) so that
replying to it will work. If you have any questions, send mail to
rna-help@lakart.UUCP.

Subject: Conversion of CP/M files to MS-DOS

I have very recently used a software package called Xeno Copy (version 2.0)
which allows the user to read CP/M files on an MS-DOS drive and transfer them toan MS-DOS formatted diskette. (It also allows a user to format a diskette
for CP/M and write files to a CP/M formatted diskette). I borrowed the package  from the campus Computing Facility and successfully used it to transfer CP/M
WordStar files onto a MS-DOS disk. Once transferred, I used a package called
PerfectExchange to translate the files from WordStar into WordPerfect 5.0. It   all worked without a hitch (amazing when you think of the difficulties to
overcome)! 

Xeno Copy was developed by a company in Los Angeles called Vertex Systems.      Version 3.0 was released (I know since the flier for this was included with the documentation the Computing Facility had for their version 2.0). I called
the number in the documentation, but it is now a number for a private residence.There is no number for Vertex Systems in the LA Directory, nor could I find a
company listing in computer software guides. (I did track down a software      
development company in Pennsylvania called Vertex Systems -- but it has nothing
to do with the LA Company).

Does anyone know if the company went out of business? Was the copyright
assigned to another company? Is it being distributed under another name?

Are there similar packages for CP/M to MS-DOS migration on the market? Can
anyone provide names, vendors?

This saves a BUNDLE on the costs for diskette conversion!

I would appreciate answers to be posted directly to my INTERNET address. I will
share the information in a single post to this board late
board later.

Thanks.

I wanna keep my only copy of dbase-2, but I did run across a copy of
Personal Pearl, a Morrow program, that I'd be willing to part with at
no charge.  HOWEVER, the master distribution disk has a read-error on
a file that I strongly believe is essential to the operation of Pearl.
Pearl is a simplified database manager and from the examples in the
book (several books-in-one) that I have it would seem to do what little
a church would require, particularly at no-charge.

Does someone else out there also own Personal Pearl, such that if I send
my stuff off to Mr. Mandrell, he'd be able somehow to get someone to supply
him with a copy of that file only.  If the company is still in existence,
they might supply it or whatever.  I'd like to help but the product is now
on the edge of the wastebasket, just waiting for a tiny shove in the wrong
direction (or another earthquake... my home is 1 mile from the epicenter
of the last 5.2/4.6 that we had ... whew) to free up some shelf space for
yet another batch'o'nearly obsolete software.

Of course, by the time this gets posted, no doubt he'll already have
15 copies of DBASE-2 and nobody will care.  Well, its worth a try.
The file on my master that I cannot read is:

	PEARLI.LIB

What exactly are you trying to do with WordStar?  So far as I know, never
having owned CP/M WordStar (I use an OLD MS-DOS version), the best way to 
put a file on another disk is to use ^K^B and ^K^K to mark the whole file
then ^K^W to write it to another file.  It works, but it's a bit clumsy.
If you need, I can send a sort of copy of my MS-DOS WScheatsheet.  WS 3.12
is functionally identical to and slower than CP/M WS of the same vintage,
since it is merely translated assembler. I got it in 1984.  What sorts of
docs do you have, and of course, what do you need?  I can probably give you
a hand.  Oh yeah, you can also copy the file from the editting no-file menu.
I almost forgot about that.
Hope this helps.

Subject: Conversion of CP/M files to MS-DOS

   There are a number of such products.  My favorite is Uniform from

        Micro Solutions, Inc.
        132 West Lincoln Highway
        DeKalb, IL 60115
        (815) 756-3411

The product comes in versions that run on IBM-PC compatibles (so that they
can read, write, and format CP/M-format diskettes) or on various CP/M
machines (Televideo, Kaypro, SB180, and others) so that they can handle the
formats for other CP/M machines AND so that they can read, write, and format
simple MS-DOS 360K format DOS diskettes.

   Another product is MediaMaster from

        Intersecting Concepts
        4573 Heatherglen Court
        Moorpark, CA 93021
        (805) 529-5073
        CIS (72145,1147)

They offer versions that run on CP/M and MS-DOS computers.  The main
difference between Uniform and MediaMaster on the PC is that the latter only
allows specific file operations to be carried out inside MediaMaster, while
Uniform creates a virtual drive (with the next available disk letter) in the
desired format, after which you can use all your favorite programs directly
on the foreign-format diskette.

   Finally, there is also a public-domain or shareware program called 22DISK
that is on most DOS BBS systems and is surely available from the archives at
SIMETEL20.

   If you want to work on a CP/M system with MS-DOS diskettes, a unique
product is DosDisk from Plu*Perfect Systems.  It does what Uniform does on
the PC, allowing you to use all your favorite software directly on the files
on the DOS diskette.  It is the only such utility for a CP/M machine that
supports DOS subdirectories and maintains file date stamps (provided the
CP/M system is running DateStamper or ZDOS).  Bridger Mitchell (the author
of DosDisk) reads this newsgroup and can answer any technical questions.

This is in reply to the recent posting on conversion software.
I suppose there are many packages, however I have just tried one
( shareware, or freeware, ) that seems to be very powerful.
It is called 22disk.  I got it from the simtel20 library. If
you have access to the net you can get it.  I think
it is in  PD1:<msdos.dskutl>  22dsk130.arc
Otherwise you can write the company at

Luther,  You've got either a Model-16 (most likely), a model-6000, or
an upgraded Model-12.  The major distinction (not important to you at this
point) is whether the 68000 has a 6 or 8 Mhz crystal.

Basically, all three of these are good reliable CP/M platforms (can run
both CP/M-2.2 and CP/M-68K).  You can also run TRSDOS (a Radio Shack
operating system) and the multi-user XENIX (Unix clone) if you have
enough memory and a hard disk.  Give TriSoft a call at (512) 472-0744
for some free info, or send me your US Mail address.

If you turn on the machine, the disks spin up, and the message
INSERT DISKETTE shows up on the screen, then the thing is probably
working (there is a self-test on powerup).

memory allocation.

The biggest problem with vi is modes.  You can't configure vedit (for
example) to look like vi, because vedit wants a META key before each
and every command mode keystroke.  Otherwise your're in insert (or

A final alternative (which I encourage some young, rambunctious hacker)

Subject: Amstrad CP/M Software

   There are several types of Amstrad computer running CP/M.  They are very
popular in England, and in Europe in general.  For a while Sears Roebuck was
promoting them here in the US, and so there are actually quite a few around.
The LocoScipt wordprocessor is actually rather nice, especially for
beginners, and both of my children (9 and 13) have been happily using it for
the past year.

   Ours is a PCW8256 that had an extra 256K or RAM chips added to convert it
into what I think is called the PCW8512 (or, perhaps, it is PCW9512).  In
any case, the PCW series of machines runs CP/M-Plus and emulates one of the
common terminals (H19, I believe, but I would have to look it up at home to
be sure).  This machine should run any public-domain or commercial software
that is designed for CP/M-Plus, and that includes almost all CP/M software.
The hardest thing is getting software onto the machine's unique 3" -- not
the standard 3.5" -- diskettes.

   My wife bought the Amstrad specifically for production of the Z-System
and other CP/M products that her company sells.  I expected the machine to
be nothing more than a toy but was most delightfully surprised to find that
it is a very solid CP/M machine and, with its substantial RAM disk, an
excellent platform for the Z-System.

   There is another series of Amstrad computers called CPC (464, 664, and
6128).  They apparently run CP/M-2.2.  I do not know very much about these
machines, but I have a contact in Germany who runs a computer club, many of
whose members have them.  I gather from what he told me that they emulate a
rather strange terminal that is not found on most software installation
programs.  Generally, however, there is little trouble in patching in the
terminal codes, and I do have a list of them.

   I would recommend that you pick up either or both of the following files
from the SIMTEL20 archives or from most CP/M remote access systems (commonly
called BBSs): CPMSVL-D.LBR (CP/M Software Vendor List), CPMSRC-H.LZT (CP/M
SouRCes).  These files have lists of sources of commercial and free CP/M
software.  If you have access to the SIMTEL20 archives, then you can get
thousands of files there that will run on your Amstrad.

   My wife has an excess of those ghastly expensive 3" Amstrad diskettes and
will sell boxes of 10 for $45 plus $3 shipping per order.  If you have no
other way to get software, I would be willing to put a few files on the
diskettes at no extra charge.  For a small copying fee, I would be willing
to convert any material you want from my Z-Node remote access sytem or from
the Boston Computer Society ZI/TEL system (which supports MS-DOS and CP/M
and also runs from my house).

Subject: Any Files For Older Altos Computer?

I have an Altos computer that was marketed under Moore Business
System's label. I understand it runs with a Z80 chip and uses
CPM, and it probably came out around the early 1980's. I'd like
 to make use of it alongside my Mac+. I understand the hard drive
 it has can't be easily interfaced to the Mac, but I'd like to
 make use of the Altos as best I can, including sending files
 back and forth to the Mac.

What I'd like to know in general is what public domain or
shareware programs are around for it, and can it run any garden
 variety CPM program(if such things exist). I have no manuals for
 the machine, plus I use my Mac+ for most everything. It's just
 that I got this Altos for cheap, and I'd like to explore what's
 out there for it, ESPECIALLY telecommunication programs and BBS
 host programs- I'm contemplating running a BBS off of it since
 it has a 8.5 Meg hard drive in it. I'd also like to know more
 about transferring files to and from my Mac+. Please send your

Hi.  I somehow goofed up my CP/M disk for my Radio Shack Model II.  I
just bought the computer a few weeks ago.  It has one drive and one
Corvus hard disk (20 Meg).  I have (had) a disk which I could boot up
and it would go over to the hard disk.  Everything was working fine until
I ran some utility called TRS2CPM (or something like that on the
TRS-DOS diskette), and it asked me to switch disks a few times and
then it said something like "No Files Found".  No, I don't know what I
was doing, and I don't have a CP/M manual.  Here is the problem - the

Subject: Utility to look at CP/M files

Earlier, I posted a note inquiring about availability of programs to
read CP/M files on an MS-DOS machine. I received several invaluable
responses. Now my problem is this: I had one diskette I was trying to
read from CP/M and write to MS-DOS format. The package I was using
(Xeno-Write) was unable to do this. When using a global search request
(*.*) to read all files, it scrolled segments of a file on the screen.

I am suspicious that the file was accidentally erased (if not, then the disk
is damaged) and that the program was looking for the file address which
was not there.

Do there exist programs like Norton Utilities for the CP/M operating system? 
If so, I can look at the file and see if anything can be retrieved.

Thanks in advance for any advice which might be rendered.

Please respond directly to my internet address (but also feel free to post
to the COMP.OS.CPM Usenet board.

Consider the 'S' editor as presented with source code in Webb Miller's

Subject: Any Cromemco Owners Out There?

I have a NorthStar Horizon for which I have been attempting to obtain a
soft-sector controller.  I located one, but one of the conditions of the
sale was that I had to take the whole computer.

So, now I am the proud owner of a Cromemco System Three, with 64K of RAM,
a parallel interface, and a soft-sector controller.  It can accomodate up
to four 8" floppy drives.  It came with one drive (a PerSci 277), which is 
reportedly broken.  So, now I need to locate a compatible 8" drive.  The
controller will take 8" or 5-1/4", but the OS is on 8" floppies.  At least
the ROM-based monitor will help me.

The plan was to get the controller and drive working on the Cromemco and
then transplant to the NorthStar.  The Cromemco is *so* nice, though, that
I may ditch the NorthStar.  It's good to have a *standard* S-100 bus, too.

So, does anyone else on the list have a Cromemco System?  Is the company
still in business?  They had a UNIX knockoff, apparently.  Anybody have
a copy I could buy or duplicate?  The supplied OS is supposed to be call
compatible with CP/M 1.3 applications.  Any applications?  I at least
need a terminal emulator/file transfer package if I'm to start getting
stuff from the archives.

Subject: INFO-CPM Digest V89 #164 - CP/M conversion

Steve Wooldridge noted that upon examining his disks using a utility, he found
fragmented files.  It may not be relevant in this case, but I encountered a
similar problem in converting a "dinosaur" disk to MS-DOS.  It was due to an
interleave of 5:1 on the SSDD floppy of the older machine.  This means that
files written by the old machine were "chopped up" when read on the PC.  To
discover what the interleave factor was, I created a large file on the old
machine, with line numbers.  By studying the sequence of the file as read by
the PC, I was able to discern the 5:1 ratio.

Another possibility might be that the older machine is fragmenting the files
for optimum disk usage.  If so, a solution might be to copy the disk onto a
new disk on the old machine before reading it on the PC.  This would likely
produce unfragmented files (but wouldn't solve any interleave problem).

I hope this will help.

Any DRI people reading this, or any BDOS gurus, out there?
I have a specific question about my flavor of BDOS.  I'm
running cp/m-68k on an hp series 200 machine.  The system
documentation specifies support for an HP9133A hard drive.
I have access to an HP9133H.  Can my BDOS be modified to 
support this later model (more bytes) disc drive?

I've tried partitioning the 'H' into smaller units comparable
to the 'A' but I get solid disc errors when I try to use it.

Anyone have any clues?

Check out DU-V80.  THis is a PD absolute disk sector editor.  I have run it
on at least three different machines, and it seems to be very good, as long
as you know what you are doing.  You need to know the directory layout, and
how to read control blocks and such, but it's pretty slick.
You can edit in ASCII or hex at a minimum.  It won't follow the sector 
allocation sequence, you have to do that yourself.  Simtel20 ought to have it,
but I couldn't tell you where it might be.  I think it should be available
on all CP/M BBS's.

Good Luck
Marc

Don't worry about miodifying your program to accomodate your
Televideo.  They both use standard ADM-3A sequences.  However, you
might want to keep your eyes open for ESC-Gx sequences, but I doubt
the Osborne supports those sequences.  Otherwise, you really don't
need to modify your program.  Have fun (Or at least try to... :)

There are a couple of things you can do.  (It sounds like you got
the system, but not the documentation.)  First, call Oakland, CA
directory assistance and ask for a company called "Silicon Valley
Surplus."  SVS bought Morrow's inventory when Morrow when bankrupt.
Although this has now been 3 or 4 years, you still may be able to
get Morrow documentation from them--assuming the company itself
still exists.  :-)

Second, check your local bookstore or public library for books on
WordStar.  There are many, but be sure to look for the older (i.e.,
pre-Version 3) ones.

If you're willing to spend a few bucks, the WordStar Company (formerly
called Micropro) still sells Version 4.0 of WordStar for CP/M
computers, inlcuding Morrow's.  Price is < $100.  Call 1-800-555-1212
and ask for an 800 number for "WordStar International" (or "Micropro").

Good Luck.

Subject: Need information on Diablo/Xerox 3000

Hello all -

I have nearby a working Diablo/Xerox model 3000 word processing unit.
It came with several single-sided 8" diskettes, none of which can be
read on my trusty old XOR S100 machine with it's WD1797-based disk
controller.

One of the diskettes is labelled CP/M-80.  Thats the good news.  The
bad news is the system doesn't recognize the disk.

The hope is to convert this system for use as a BBS for the hearing
impaired.  To do this, I have been hunting for a technical manual.  I
would like to know the backplane pinout and I/O port addressing for
the serial/parallel ports present on the machine.

I have been on the phone to one division of Diablo/Xerox after
another.  I have been shuttled from one long distance call to another,
finally completing the "loop" by the last-called division saying to
contact the first-called division.

The machine _is_ old; circa 1980.  But I am hoping someone _out there_
knows something about it or can refer me to the _right place_.

Your help is appreciated.  Please e-mail your information.  If there
is any interest, I will summarize to the group.

CP/M normally tries to prevent you from writing to a disk that was not
in the drive the most recent time that the drive was accessed.  However,
Wordstar does have a command called "Log A New Disk".  Look on the
Control-K menu (press and hold the control Key, and then press and
release the K key) and wait for the menus to come up.  I think the
correct combination is ^KL.  You can then remove the disk from drive
B, and insert a new disk for reading and writing files.  I don't believe
that this can be done in the middle of an edit session, (WHILE you are
actually editing a file), but you can do this in between file edits.
You cannot remove the "A" disk while editing because the Wordstar messages
are coming from it while you are editing.

If you want to move a file from one disk onto a new disk to that you can
edit it there (where it is less crowded), use the PIP command as follows:

1. Make sure you know which file name you wish to copy on the source disk. 

2. Reset your system, (^C) with your master CP/M disk in the A: drive and the
destination (freshly formatted/initialized disk in drive B:

3. Issue the command PIP

4. The PIP prompt appears on the screen.  When your disk activity light
goes out, remove the A (master) disk and insert your source disk.

5. Type:  b:=a:filename.ext[v]

The file gets copied to the new disk.  Notice that this does not violate
CP/M's disk-change rules because the new disk you inserted is read-only
and that is all you are doing to it.  The B disk was in the drive when the
system was reset, so as long as it is not itself write protected, you can
copy to it.

6.  Reinsert your master disk into the A drive, and type ^C (Control-C)
to exit PIP.

How much (if any) Morrow documentation did you get with the system?
I don't have a Morrow, but did buy SOME of its docs at a computer swap
meet because I have a Kaypro and it runs most Morrow software.
For a small fee I may be willing to part with some of the docs that
I do have.

Subject: Onyx computers, help

I am the proud owner of two onyx cpm/mpm/oasis computers, a onyx 5000
which is a single user 64k cpm system with a 20meg hard disk and a
onyx 8000 which is 4 user oasis/mpm system with 128k and a 20 meg
hard disk.  Currently these systems have no floppy drives in them.
My problems is that I can find no docs for these systems anywhere.
Both run as they are (booting from the hard disk), but I would like
to implement UZI or something similar on them and need low level
technical specs on them.  Also would like to to add floppies to them
and need some tech specs on them to do so.  If anyone out there has 
some docs for these systems I would appreciate hearing from you.
Thanx in advance!

I have a manual for the FD1165, from NEC.  The power connector on that
one matches the one you describe, so I assume that it's the same drive.

Anyway, here's the pinout:

	1 -DC +24 v

	4 -- Ground
	5 -- N/C
	6 -- N/C
	7 -- FG ( Frame Ground )

If you need it, I have both the product description and e maintenance

Subject: BDOS Guru for CP/M-68K

Jon,  you are looking for the right thing, in the wrong place.

The tables that (SHOULD) control the disk size and configuration
are the DPH (disk parameter header) and DPB (disk parameter block).
They are located in the BIOS, which is unique to each machine type
you are using.  The BDOS and CCP doesn't change from machine to
machine (at least, not for a particular version of CP/M-68K).

You can get SOME idea of the DPH and DPB from the DSK: display of
the STAT command.  To really look at the tables you need to do
the following:

	Bring up DDT

	Punch in a little program to do a SELECT DISK

		BIOS function 9

	The value returned in Reg. D0.L is a pointer to
		the DPH.  Eight words into the DPH is a
		pointer to the DPB.  Pretty much everything
		the system knows about your disk is
		contained in these two tables.

If you have source to the BIOS, modifying it for a bigger disk
(or partitioning it) is trivial.  If not, it can be a challenge.
One problem is that the CSV and ALV may need to be increased 
in size for a bigger disk.

For further information, check pages 24 and 40-45 of the
CP/M-68K SYSTEM manual (note: page numbers may vary, I am
looking in an old manual).

Subject: Trashed CP/M diskette

I had to read the letter twice to get it all straight (I think).  And
I believe I know what happened to your diskette.

As I interpret things, you had a Model-II with a copy of ATON CP/M
booted, and tried to run a program called TRS2CPM.  That is a Pickles&
Trout program, which assumes certain things about the system ... no
telling *WHAT* it did to any diskette it found lurking around.

ATON was (is?) a company that sold CP/M for the Model-II, etc.
They made a very TECHNICALLY good product (extremely fast, and
found several hardware features in the machines that even TANDY
didn't know were there).  Their documentation and general quality
control were nowhere near the level of Pickles&Trout, however, and
as a result they never sold more than a small fraction of what
P&T did.

You're right, they all used a number of different disk formats
(standard??? what's that?).  P&T got more storage from a diskette,
but will not read Lifeboat or ATON diskettes (except in the common
SSSD interchange CP/M standard).  It ALSO sounds like you may
have a CORVUS hard disk.  ***BIG PROBLEM***   I could probably
salvage your ATON disk from some of the stuff I have around
TriSoft  (and we can certainly supply replacement P&T disks
and manuals), but we have NOTHING for the CORVUS hard disks.

ATON International *may* still be around, although I do not have
their address handy.  Maybe someone else can help with that.

Subject: Writing PC-DOS Disks on a Kaypro

Bill Swan and others asked about public domain programs to allow reading
and writing MS-DOS disks on a Kaypro.  Why does it have to be public domain?
If you have a TurboROM or KROM, you can use the marvelous DosDisk from
Plu*Perfect.  It costs only $30, hardly a lot of money to make the machine
useful.  With DosDisk, one of the Kaypro drives will act just like an MS-DOS
drive: you can use all your standard programs to access files on the disk.
DosDisk is unique in giving you access not only to the root directory of the
DOS disk but to all subdirectories as well.

Subject: Conversion of CP/M(?) files to MS-DOS

After seeing the discussion on file conversion, I'd thought I'd give my
current problem a shot.  Has anybody heard of an NEC PC 9801 and is it
a CP/M machine?  The basic situation is this; My boss is trying to put
together a book with various authors writing individual chapters.  One
hope of the publisher was to have all the chapters on disk (and in the
same format) so that the typesetting, etc. would be easier.  One of the
authors sent us his chapter on a 2SHD diskette from the NEC PC 9801,
using Wordstar version 4.0.  I called NEC here in the states and the
guy said that he's never heard of it and that the parent company in
Japan sells a completely different line of pc's.  If it is a CP/M machine
will any of the previously mentioned conversion software (Uniform, Media-
Master, 22DSK do the job?   I should mention, the only CP/M capable
machine we have is the DEC Rainbow, with the RX50 drives.  We have
several MS-DOS computers around, with both 360K and 1.2 MB drives avail-
able.  Please respond directly if possible.  Thanks.

hello,

a friend of mine asked me to place a request concerning a tatung cp/m-

has some troubles as follows:
- as described in the manual, there should be a possibility to add a
  third disk-drive; but doing so, the controller sets all four select-
  outputs to high-level instead only drive-select-2. the disk controller
  should be a wd1793, but a MB8877A (fairchild?) is built-in.
  who knows anything about that problem or can tell us anything about
  that chip?
- other problems are to install a 2-mb-ramdisk and/or a 27-mb-harddisk.
  it also should be possible (manual), but there's no description, how.

please contact me, if you could help us and/or you're tatung-user too.

Speaking strictly for myself, it does not have to be public domain. It just
seemed more likely to be p/d than to be a commercial product.
  
Be that as it may - the Kaypro in question is vanilla, so where can I get a
"TurboROM" or "KROM", and how much is *that*?
  
(Also, do you have an address for Plu*Perfect?)
