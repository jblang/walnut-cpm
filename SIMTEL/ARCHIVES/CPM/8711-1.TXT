Can anyone advise where the ARC program for the CP/M systems is available?
hopefully it is somewhere near Halifax, N.S. It is to be used on an Osborne
computer system and also under the Atari ST CP/M emulator.
Thanks.

Thanks to Steve Sherin for answering so promptly and on the weekend yet.
Since your answer I received a HEX file from Keith Petersen at Simtel20
which contains an UNARC program. Thanks loads guys. Enjoy the weekend.

Keith,

I received you message and had already read most of what you had sent.
However, let me explain to you what I did and maybe you can help me.

I used "FTP SIMTEL20.ARPA" and logged in as anonymous/guest.
I did a bget (binary get) to download arc521.com to my VAX 11/780.
I logged out of SIMTEL20 and proceeded to use my VAX to run XMODEM.
I have a TANDY (IBM PC CLONE) the uses MIRROR (CROSSTALK CLONE). It 
supports XMODEM protocol as well. So I ran XMODEM on my VAX, issued the
Send command, issued an RX (Receive XMODEM) command on my TANDY,
and downloaded ARC521.COM.
 
After logging out of the VAX I executed the command ARC521 and
got garbage on the screen. That is where I stand.

Along the way I downloaded ARC.EXE from <PC-BLUE> in the same manner
and got a "Program too big to fit in memory" on my TANDY. I have 640k
on my TANDY so I know there is plenty of room.

I hope you might be able to help me.

Thanks.

Kathy(piccionek@eglin-vax.arpa)

PS. My TANDY runs MSDOS 3.2.

I missed the posting here of Small C as originally published in
Dr. Dobb's Journal.  I am looking for the C source or 6502 source
for a Commodore C-64.  I have a C compiler for the C-64, but it
would be nice to port the public domain Small C to the C-64.

Kathy,

Please do not use "bget" or "type image" when transferring binary
files from this host.  Those two commands expect the host on the other
end to also be a 32-bit word machine.  This host is a 36-bit word
machine, and the resulting file will be trash as you observed.

The proper command it "type l 8" or its equivalent, "tenex."  But,
beware that some recent ftp programs have been appearing with "tenex"
incorrectly implemented as a "type l 32" equivalent.  If you have
problems, as your local system wizard, and refer to this message.

                        PBBS version 4.0

                 Changes from Previous Versions

This release fixes all known bugs in version 3.0.


PBBSHDR:
ZCPR3 compatiblity/enhancements from Ron Hilgert and others.
Added equates  to support the DISKLOG feature  of  BYE510.   This
     also  requires  a  new location in low memory  (DSKFLG:)  to
     allow  the  DISKLOG to be turned on and  off.   A  new  flag
     (DSKLOG:)  was  added  to  allow the sysop  to  disable  the
     disklog code if he is not using it.
Added DSPCLR flag to allow/disable displaying the last 13 callers
     when  PBYE  logs  the caller off of  the  system.   Only  13
     callers  are displayed,  since this is all that will fit  on
     the screen with the rest of the messages between callers.
Added support  for separate DUs for new CP/M and MS-DOS  uploads.
     If the MSDOS:  equate is yes,  then the system will ask each
     user  (level  3 and up) which operating system  he  prefers.
     Then,  when he jumps from PBBS to CP/M,  he will be sent  to
     the appropriate DU.  This question is only asked one time.
Added equates  to allow the BULLETIN.PBS file to be displayed  at
     login  (BULTIN:)  and to allow a different welcome file  for
     each user level from 2 to 7 (WELCUM:).
Added equate to allow the sysop to display system usage stats  at
     each  login  (DSTATS:).   See  PBBS section for  details  of
     stats.
Sysop  may  now  choose  whether he wants to ask  each  user  for
     comments at signoff by setting the EXCMT equate.
Added equate  to allow 2 methods of displaying messages during  a
     READ comand (SKPHDR:).  Sysop may choose whether to show the
     header  and  the  message at one time or to  show  just  the
     header  and  then  ask the user if he  wishes  to  read  the
     message.
Added necessary  EXT's to header to take advantage of new PBBSUBS
     routines suggested and provided by Ian Cottrell.
Added   new  hash  table  to  more  closely  follow  the   normal      
     distribution of last names throughout the alphabet.
PBBS:
Included  the "U" by user level into the standard  command.   Any
     user may scan users by access level - up to own level only.
Fixed the  YAK  problem  of loosing  unlimited  time  users  when
     Yakking.
Fixed the  message pause counter problem seen when listing a long
     message during the message entry/edit section.
Added the  capability  to ask for NEW+ or N+ and get  a  non-stop
     dump of all of the new messages since you were last on.
New auto wrap routines during message entry, thanks to Irv Hoff.
When a  user uses the WHATSNEW feature to view new  uploads,  the
     system  now  shows  him where in the list  his  last  log-in
     occurred.  Super new routines from Dick Roberts.
PBBS now uses a new hash routine to improve the effectiveness  of
     the user lookup routines.
System now prompts new users for a desired screen width (from  39
     to  78) and uses this width when displaying  messages,  etc.
     From Irv again.
Dick  Roberts added routines to keep track of the number of users
     and total active time for the system each day.   The  number
     of users for the current day and the percentage usage of the
     system  for  the  current  day  and  the  previous  day  may
     optionally be displayed to each user at login.
Syste     deposit  users  into  the appropriate area when  they  leave
     PBBS.
Each time the [more] prompt is displayed, users may enter a space
     (space  bar) to advance the screen 1 line (and  display  the
     [more]  prompt again).   Entry of any other character causes
     another full screen to be displayed.
Changed the prompts on the message headers to  R)ead,  P)revious,
     N)ext or E)xit.
Changed the prompts after a message display to .........

PMAINT:
Added a  feature that was submitted by Terry Pinto that  displays
     the  record  number  of  the user  next  to  his  name  when
     displaying user records from PMAINT.
Defeatured  the (8) command to only show the users that are going
     to be deleated on the next PBYE user purge.   I did this  to
     allow  you  to  recover  from  catastrophic  clock  failures
     without destroying your user and message bases.
Ian Cottrell added the complete sort routine for the user  rehash
     selection.   Now there is no need for an external program to
     do this.  Thanks IAN.
New hash routines also used here.
When the  sysop renumbers the message base,  each user's previous
     high  message  counter  is  translated  to  the  appropriate
     message  in  the new numbering scheme.  Users no longer lose
     their  place in the message base whenever the  messages  are
     renumbered.

PBBSUBS:
In  the process of cleaning up some code in PBBSUBS, I discovered
     that  they have never checked for DISK FULL  condition  when
     writting  to the disk.   I suppect that much of the  strange
     behavior  that  was  un-trackable was in fact  due  to  this
     problem.   Please  use  only the new version of  PBBSUBS.REL
     from now on.   The error messages have been expanded to give
     you a better idea of what may have caused the problem.
All  hardcopy support routines have been moved to the  SUBS,  and
     eliminated  from the PMAINT program.   Several routines were
     re-coded to take advantage of new techniques for moving data
     - Thanks Ian.
Added several  new  routines and cleaned up much of the  code  to
     streamline the 'subs' routines.

ALL OTHERS
     Added  necessay  code  to  take  advantage  of  new  PBBSUBS
     routines and new flags in PBBSHDR.

                 Installation Notes for PBBS 4.0

All previous PBBS utilities are obsoleted by this release.   None
of them will work after installing this system.   All of the PBBS
message and users files are fully compatible, BUT,  you must pack
the  message base using your old PBBSMNT prior to installing  the
new system.  You MUST use the new PBBSUBS.REL file provided.

INSTALLATION:

     1)  Using your old PBBSMNT,  pack the message base to remove
     all  deleted messages.  The old way of deleting messages  is
     incompatible with the (R),(D) flags.

     2)   Go through the PBBSHDR.MAC file and set the equates for
     your  system.  All previous hdrs are obsolete and cannot  be
     used.  Then assemble and link all PBBS 4.0 files.
     NOTE:  If you decide to use the WELCUM equate, you will need
          to  build text files for user levels between 2  and  7.
          These  files  are  named WELCOM#.PBS,  where the  #  is
          replaced with the user's level.

     3)  Rehash your users file with the new PBBSMNT.  This  will
     set the new hash order and allow the rest of the programs to
     function.

Russ

     to  78) and uses this width when displaying  messages,  etc.
     From Irv again.
Dick  Roberts added routines to keep track of the number of users
     and total active time for the system each day.   The  number
     of users for the current day and the percentage usage of the
     system  for  the  current  day  and  the  previous  day  may
     optionally be displayed to each user at login.
Syste     deposit  users  into  the appropriate area when  they  leave
     PBBS.
Each time the [more] prompt is displayed, users may enter a space
     (space  bar) to advance the screen 1 line (and  display  the
     [more]  prompt again).   Entry of any other character causes
     another full screen to be displayed.
Changed the prompts on the message headers to  R)ead,  P)revious,
     N)ext or E)xit.
Changed the prompts after a message display to .........

PMAINT:
Added a  feature that was submitted by Terry Pinto that  displays
     the  record  number  of  the user  next  to  his  name  when
     displaying user records from PMAINT.
Defeatured  the (8) command to only show the users that are going
     to be deleated on the next PBYE user purge.   I did this  to
     allow  you  to  recover  from  catastrophic  clock  failures
     without destroying your user and message bases.
Ian Cottrell added the complete sort routine for the user  rehash
     selection.   Now there is no need for an external program to
     do this.  Thanks IAN.
New hash routines also used here.
When the  sysop renumbers the message base,  each user's previous
     high  message  counter  is  translated  to  the  appropriate
     message  in  the new numbering scheme.  Users no longer lose
     their  place in the message base whenever the  messages  are
     renumbered.

PBBSUBS:
In  the process of cleaning up some code in PBBSUBS, I discovered
     that  they have never checked for DISK FULL  condition  when
     writting  to the disk.   I suppect that much of the  strange
     behavior  that  was  un-trackable was in fact  due  to  this
     problem.   Please  use  only the new version of  PBBSUBS.REL
     from now on.   The error messages have been expanded to give
     you a better idea of what may have caused the problem.
All  hardcopy support routines have been moved to the  SUBS,  and
     eliminated  from the PMAINT program.   Several routines were
     re-coded to take advantage of new techniques for moving data
     - Thanks Ian.
Added several  new  routines and cleaned up much of the  code  to
     streamline the 'subs' routines.

ALL OTHERS
     Added  necessay  code  to  take  advantage  of  new  PBBSUBS
     routines and new flags in PBBSHDR.

                 Installation Notes for PBBS 4.0

All previous PBBS utilities are obsoleted by this release.   None
of them will work after installing this system.   All of the PBBS
message and users files are fully compatible, BUT,  you must pack
the  message base using your old PBBSMNT prior to installing  the
new system.  You MUST use the new PBBSUBS.REL file provided.

INSTALLATION:

     1)  Using your old PBBSMNT,  pack the message base to remove
     all  deleted messages.  The old way of deleting messages  is
     incompatible with the (R),(D) flags.

     2)   Go through the PBBSHDR.MAC file and set the equates for
     your  system.  All previous hdrs are obsolete and cannot  be
     used.  Then assemble and link all PBBS 4.0 files.
     NOTE:  If you decide to use the WELCUM equate, you will need
          to  build text files for user levels between 2  and  7.
          These  files  are  named WELCOM#.PBS,  where the  #  is
          replaced with the user's level.

     3)  Rehash your users file with the new PBBSMNT.  This  will
     set the new hash order and allow the rest of the programs to
     function.

I regret to report that the file server in place at LISTSERV@RPICICGE.BITNET
has been swamped with more requests than it can apparently handle at this
time.  The bottleneck is the rate at which files can be transferred from
Simtel20 to my server's cache via FTP.

More than half of all requests are getting rejected after the 5 day
time-out period.  And more than three quarters of the requests are for
IBM PC software.  Since it was my intent to offer the service first and
foremost to the Info-CPM community for access to the Simtel20 CP/M archives,
the server will now accept requests for files from the CPM and SIGM
directories only.  Access to the PC-BLUE and MSDOS collections is
suspended indefinitely.  If/when there is some reliability improvements
and through-put improvements to the several internet gateways between
Simtel20 and my host, I will remove the restriction.

By the way, if anyone out there in Bitnet-land with a VM/CMS host and
an internet connection is interested in sponsoring a copy of the server,
please let me know....

SIMTEL20 stores binaries in a funny way:  it has a 36 bit word length, so it
stores 4 8-bit bytes in each 36-bit word, the other 4 bits being zero filled.
If you use a binary ftp, you get a direct copy of this, which is garbage for
your computer.  What you will need to do is to find out how (with your
particular system) to make ftp do the translation from 36 bits to 4 8-bit
bytes for you.  On our 11/780 VAXen (4.3 bsd), one types the command "tenex"
at the ftp prompt.  I forget where the name comes from.  You'll have to
find out if there is something similar for your machine.  Also, when you
perform the file transfer to your Tandy, be sure that you put sending xmodem
into binary mode; otherwise it will translate every occurence of ^J to ^M^J
(file for text files, but it really mangles binaries).

Copies of CP/M-86 can be found sometimes from Priority 1 or S-100.  If you
have a Compupro type system try direct to COmpupro or one of their dealers.  
   
One other suggestion - I get much of my CP/M and S-100 stuff from a place in
Rialto, California.  They (actually He) may be able to be of help.  Try
Microcomputer Solutions (Michael Louie) at 714-820-9850.  He has alot of

CP/M-816 (8088/8080 both) and Hard disk.  Very helpful and knowlegable.  Hope
this helps.

There was a problem on SIMTEL20 Saturday night with ANONYMOUS ftp
logins.  It has been fixed.

The system has been going through some changes in the past week.  It
now has more memory and the network server has a higher priority (both
of which have made a great improvement in response time).  Later this
week we will be doubling the disk storage space available.

Please bear with us if there are some problems during this transition.

There are two versions - one supports automatic compression with
Huffman squeezing, packing or storing, along with DIR and delete
member file - and another version with LZW crunching, packing or

The LZW version requires a large ( >60K ) CP/M and is much slower than

   Speaking of SIMTEL20 problems... I have not been able to get
to simtel20 for the past month now.  The most common problem
is simtel20's ftp processor is not responding after I am
connected, or sometimes I would get connection timed-out error.
   Last week I read that ARPANET is having some work done to
it to improve access and communications between sites but I
am not sure if this is the problem.

I do not know much about the FTP facilities on your VAX, but I do
know that there has been some historical confusion about the
appropriate TYPE command needed when fetching binary files.  The
Tops-20 system (Simtel20) supports variable "byte" sizes, and it
is necessary to inform FTP what byte size is being used.
    The archive blurb suggests TYPE L 8 (meaning an 8-bit byte)
for binary transfers.  I have never gotten this to work on my
IBM host, but TYPE L 32 works just fine (plus one other command
to disable ASCII->EBCDIC translation).  You might try preceding
the RETR command in FTP with TYPE.  If your implementation does
not support the TYPE command, try QUOT TYPE L 32 (or 8).

Subject: ARC maker for CP/M now available from SIMTEL20

Be careful with the new ARC maker for CP/M.  There are some problems
that will have to ironed out in the next revision.  The following
message is from RCP/M Royal Oak (313) 759-6569.

Re:   CP/M ARK program

   I feel like a kid who got exactly the toy he wanted for Christmas --
but then found out it didn't work.

   After waiting over a year for a CP/M archive program, it's finally
here.  But it's slow and has some dangerous bugs.

   There are two versions:  ARCS does file compression by Squeezing,
ARCC does it by crunching.  Each has it's own problems.

   ARCS bombs out if you try to put more than 64 files into an archive.
It WILL close the archive correctly, but if you specified a file list
or wild cards totally more than 64 files, it just aborts after the the
64th is arc'd.  And it IS slow:  I was trying to archive the initial
program load for my RAMdisk, about 700K in 65 files.  Took OVER AN HOUR
to get the 64th file (RAMdisk to floppy).  Then ten very noisy minutes
of disk error retry, trying to figure out where to put the 65th file.
Finally it aborted.

   ARCC has a different problem.  The docs say it needs a TPA of AT LEAST
60K.  I have 56K, and it works if you try to archive small files, and
specify a small file list.  BUT if you run out of memory, it DOES NOT
exit gracefully -- it goes off into never-never land, and sometimes
will trash your disk directory en route.

    ARCC is even slower than ARCS -- a single 12K file took about 5
minutes to archive (RAMdisk to RAMdisk) on my 4Mhz Kaypro.  So even if
you have the memory to run it, you might not have the time.

    If you need 'em, they're here -- but be careful . . .

I want to thank all of you who responded to my plea about help on ARC
files. For your information, I was finally able to download files
to my TANDY. Here's how I did it:
 		ftp simtel20.arpa
		Logged in
		tenex
		get <files> <files>
		ex

Then I used KERMIT to download the files.

AND IT WORKED!!!!!

Thanks again for all your help.

James Hendrix has a book on Small-C named _The Small C Handbook_.
It discusses the structure of the compiler, interworkings, etc.
Pretty much all you ever wanted to know about Small-C is in there.
It includes a source for Small-C (for the 8080).

Message-Id: <5772@j.cc.purdue.edu>
Sender: info-cpm-request@simtel20.arpa
To: info-cpm@simtel20.arpa

I recently obtained an *old* NEC-PC8801A from a friend
who wants me to do some custom work on it. As inherited,
it had only the assembler -- and now, after some deliberation
and a lot of downloading traffic from simtel20, the beast
is being tamed. 

I obtained a version of N88-Disk BASIC from NEC (thanks,
Richard Johnson) with the following BASIC files:

	setinf.n88	phyfrm.n88	...

My question is: What are these for? The documentation is
a bit sparse -- "setinf" is supposed to write an information
track to disk (for what purpose, I don't know) and "phyfrm"
"physically" formats a DMA disk (presumably the 8881 drives
I have), whatever "physical" formatting involves (as opposed
to "normal" formatting).

Also, if anyone can offer some information on either purchasing
or obtaining a public domain version of "ZASM", I'd be grateful.
(I believe ZASM is needed to assemble the ZCPR3 sources from
simtel20????).

Any responses are probably best handled via e-mail. UUCP is
ok, ARPA preferred (agv@s.cc.purdue.edu). Much thanks in advance.

Asking for info on P.D. versions of pascal, prolog, lisp:

I have turned up the following info:
FOG, PO Box 3474, Daly City, CA 94015 (415-755-2000)
has JRT Pascal on 4 PD disks  $4 each for members $8 for nonmembers

Central Computer Products, 330 Central Ave., Fillmore CA 93015
(800-533-8049) sells LISP/80 for $36, also has Turbo Pascal for $59

Spite Software, 4875 SW 19th Drive, Portland OR 97201 (800-237-9111)
has FTL Modula2 for $49.95 ($39.95 for FOG members).

I have not been able to locate a PD version of lisp or prolog.
Hope the above will be of use - I mentions the Modula2 since it is
basically an improved version of Pascal.

I would also suggest looking at CP/M COMAL available from
COMAL Users Group USA, 6041 Monona Drive Madison WI.  It is the best
programming language I have yet found (I have compared it against
Pascal, Basic, Modula2, C, Fortran).

The Kaypro 1 (& all 1984 & up) has 16k of static video ram controlled by a
Synertek 6845.  The '83 series II's and IV's had 2k of memory mapped video
ram that is bank switched (if I remember correctly).  I you have software
for the early Kaypros that tries to write to video ram, strange things
will happen.  The '84's use the additional ram to provide video attributes.
The following escape sequences are used by the '84 series.

Position Cursor:		ESC,'=',row+32,col+32
Home Cursor:			^^ or RS
Cursor Left:			^H
Cursor Right:			^L
Cursor Up:			^K
Cursor Down:			^J
Line Feed:			^J
Carriage Return:		^M
Erase EOS:			^W
Erase EOL:			^X
Erase Screen:			^Z
Insert Line:			ESC, 'E'
Delete Line:			ESC, 'R'

The following sequences are supported ONLY on '84 series and all Kaypro 10's

Write Pixel:			ESC, '*', row+32, col+32
Erase Pixel:			ESC, ' ', row+32, col+32
Draw Line:			ESC, 'L', row1+32, col1+32, row2+32, col2+32
Erase Line:			ESC, 'D', row1+32, col1+32, row2+32, col2+32

Attributes are produced by the following:

Inverse on:			ESC, 'B0'
   "    off:			ESC, 'C0'
Half intensity on:		ESC, 'B1'
 "       "     off:		ESC, 'C1'
Blinking on:			ESC, 'B2'
   "	 off:			ESC, 'C2'
Underline on:			ESC, 'B3'
   "	  off:			ESC, 'C3'
Cursor on:			ESC, 'B4'
   "   off"			ESC, 'C4'
Graphics Mode on:		ESC, 'B5'
   "      "   off:		ESC, 'C5'
Save Cursor Position:		ESC, 'B6'
Restore "	"		ESC, 'C6'
Status Line Protection on:	ESC, 'B7'
  "	"	"      off:	ESC, 'C7'

The following sequences are supported only on '83's:

Display Ascii:			ESC, 'A'
Display Greek:			ESC, 'G'

The only other big difference is system size.  '83 II's & IV's have a 64k
system, floppy drive '84's a 63k system, and Kaypro 10's and all U-ROM Kaypros
have a 60k system.  You could be running into a memory conflict problem (but
I think this in unlikely).

Hope this helps.

Hello ZCPR users:

   I am planning to get ZCPR33 softwares for my CP/M machine. It is not
good idea to get some softwares from BitNet File Server. I want that where
is ZCPR33 softwares that company sells or gave away. Best to send SASE-mailer
to for distribute ZCPR33 softwares. Please let me know for more information
about how to obtain ZCPR33 softwares and ZRDOS softwares, etc.. Thanks!

Hello, everyone:

I don't have ratfor compiler! At Simtel20 Library, I get RATFOR.LBR from

badly! Can you send me ratfor package?? Source code?? If you are sending

Strange as it may seem, I'm looking for an emulator for a Z80 CP/M system
that will run on either a 3B1 or a 3B2.  It should mimic CP/M and permit
CP/M COM files to run.  

Does anyone know of such a beast?  Thanks.

	Yes, I believe I know of one instance when the above was done.
Apparently someone ported a FIG Forth CP/M system over to the Model 100/102.
The above system (and a good bit of support programming) is availible on
the M100SIG of Compuserve.  I haven't downloaded it yet (got my M102 just 2
weeks ago) but it should be OK since I have the implementation  on my
Osborne-1.

A friend of mine has a Sanyo MBC 1200 and is trying to re-write (modify)
his BIOS to include more entries in his jump table.  He modified it, re-
assembled it, and does not work.  It seems that the skewing is not working
properly (but dont quote me on that).  No references are made to the area
(at least not direct references that were not recognized by the disassembler.

If anyone has any dealings with modifying this BIOS, please help, as we

Does anyone have scehmatics or actual BIOS listings for this machine?

Thanks for any help.

Thanks - I knew of this and this was in part my motivation to ask the
CP/M list.  I downloaded all of that stuff and it ought to work for
just about anybody's machine, except if you want to edit screens it's
set up to use a Chipmunk disk.  I'd prefer to edit a screen file just on
the Tandy and let BASIC write it off to a cassette or someplace (I have
a System-100 Streaming tape - good stuff).  BTW there is a version of
MVP Forth for the M100 that is compatible with the CP/M-80 incarnation,
only problem is the Model 100 version takes over almost all the RAM from
the top down and is not relocatable.  It is fully compatible with the
CP/M-80 version though...

CompuServe also had some file in the M100 libraries that held some useful
equates that you could use under either M80 or ASM, I forget which, but
nobody took it any further than a few simple things.

First there's Betz's XLISP, then there is a Lisp-in-Pascal that's got
a couple of iterations in CPMUG or SIG/M someplace - but that version
doesn't support arithmatic - and their is ILISP (scheme-ish), which I got

Are there any other LISPs, esp. in a high-level language or 8080/Z80

I would greatly appreciate help from someone who knows their way around
cpm 2.2 and/or Kaypro IV's and Perfect writer.

I purchased a Kaypro IV used a 1 1/2 years ago.  I wanted to do some database
work for my parents who own a Kaypro 10.  In any case, I have come to know
and love Perfect Writer recently, and have a parallel printer.  The problem
seems to be that Perfect Writer was originally installed for a serial printer.
I had the printer working on my folks Kaypro 10 (under Wordstar), but now
it doesn't work with my IV.  When running the PFCONFIG program, I get
into a menu which asks for some CPM BIOS numbers and masks.  I didn't
get a CPM book with my IV, so I don't know what they mean.  If anyone knows
how to select the parallel port under Perfect Writer or has a handy listing
of the BIOS calls by number, I would appreciate it.

Thanks very much, in advance!!

     The performance of the Avatex 1200 has been quite adequate for me.  It is
not particularly noise-sensitive, and is extremely reliable.

     As for its Hayes compatibility...  All you get are a few of the AT
commands.  No S registers.  The only way to drop carrier is to drop DTR on
your RS-232 port.  Linitations, but not serious ones.

** FLAME ON!!! ***

  This is a most frustrating, Arpanet-chauvinistic attitude! Only a fraction
of the people who recieve this newsgroup have the capability of performing FTP
access to the massive SIMTEL20 archives. This summer, SIMTEL20 shut down their
mail server, so that's out too... but I guess those on Arpanet don't care
about that. If they want to use SIMTEL20, fine, but DON'T go telling the rest 
of the group not to post binaries! Come ON!!!

** FLAME OFF **.

  I'm sure Keith didn't think his answer through before replying, or perhaps
it was a stock answer formulated back when things were different, or
something. He's been too generous with us, myself included, in the past. 

  However, the point needs making. I can neither submit not retrieve files 
from SIMTEL20. This is not an idle complaint - I would do both if I could.

  There _is_ a mail server on the network: listserv@rpicicge.bitnet (the
contact appears to be "John S. Fisher" <FISHER@RPICICGE.bitnet>). It has taken
over a large chunk of SIMTEL20's CPM mail service, for those who have access
to BITNET. Of course, it's not quite current and has limited "bandwidth", but
deserves a lot of support. I believe it's download-only at the moment. 

  I suggest that binary postings to the net use either HEX or UUENCODE format. 
There are public domain programs available to work with both; HEX is easier to 
get the software for, but I understand that UUENCODE does some compression.

If the posting of binaries starts on Info-Cpm I will shut off the
Usenet and CsNet gateways from this mailing list.  There are other
ways of distributing binaries other than a mailing list.

I am the one who must wade through all the mailer rejections that are
caused by mailing list recipients exceeding their alloted disk space
and by angry system administrators who have deliberate message size
limits because they have to PAY for every byte that they receive.

The Info-Cpm mailing list handler presently has a limit of about 50k.
If binary postings start I will ask the system administrator to reduce
it to 10k.  I don't have the time to read all the rejections.

Instead of talking about posting binaries perhaps a discussion should
be started about a file server for CsNet and Usenet.  There are a
number of hosts that are on both the Arpanet and one of those two
nets.

A friend works for a company that has some IMS systems running Turbodos.  They
canceled their maintenance contract with the people who were maintaining the
systems and picked up a new contractor, but the new contract is only for
hardware.  Even tho' the technician has attempted to make work with the
software, they don't have the source to the [modified] OS, and as such have
trouble getting the system to work with some of the new hardware they are
installing.

Any leads to contractors who can help in this area would be greatly
appreciated.

Info-Cpm, fine... but what about posting to comp.os.cpm (or how about 
comp.{sources,binaries}.cpm)? Some of us out here in the net.boonies
don't have FTP access to the SIMTEL20 archives...

It is ironic that this dialog arrived in my mailbox on "Graham-Rudman
Day."  SIMTEL20.arpa is funded by your tax dollars and mine.  The
official justification for even having CPM archives on this machine is
that there are still a number of CPM workstations in government
laboratories and offices which are made more useful and efficient (as
are their human users) by having public domain CPM software readily
available.

In various times and places, we have all heard pleadings to keep down
the volume of traffic flowing through UUCP links in order to keep down
the long distance telephone bills of the individual users.  Similarly,
we are seeing problems in internetworking to Bitnet and to the
UK community because host resources are overworked and funds are not
forthcoming to upgrade gateways.

Well, folks, the U.S. government is in the same boat as the rest of us.
Keith Peterson and many other folks on Arpanet/MILNET machines are not
paid to distribute public domain software to the world at large.  Their
kind extensions of their work time into their personal lives and time
represents a "second mile" not always noticed or appreciated.

I agree with Keith:  Servers on Bitnet and "the UUCP net" are needed to
complement SIMTEL's service.  Such a server,  APPLE2-L, runs under
something called LISTSERV at BROWNVM.  Also, a UseNet group,
comp.binaries.cpm, might be useful.  Conceivably, it could be gatewayed
with a Bitnet server.

But if the folks in the U.S. REALLY desire some governmental austerity,
they're all going to have to allow their own oxen to be gored just a
little.

I think it is really unfair to flame at Simtel20 and/or the internet
at large just because they have something and "you cannot get it".
The fact is that just about everything in the Simtel20 archives
(at least for CP/M) is available through alternate means.  There
are the public BBS's and the information network services and the
marketeers of public domain software collections.

Granted, those aren't quite free, but the cost is actually modest.
Mail over the networks isn't quite free, either, by the way.  You
may not see any direct chargeback for mail sent and received, but
some of us do.  And we all pay in some sense for any unnecessary
load placed on the networks.

Please do not construe my comments as "dog-in-the-manger"
(if that is the right analogy) just because I now have FTP access to
Simtel20 and you don't.  I joined this group before I had FTP and
before Simtel20 started the mail-based archive service.  I did not
think that I had any "inherient right" to be able to access the Simtel20
archives then, nor when the mail service was cancelled, nor now.

By the way, the file server at RPICICGE.Bitnet can also be addressed
via CICGE.RPI.EDU on the internet.  Eventhough targeted to service
the Bitnet Info-CPM people, mail requests from other networks are
supported as long as the server can figure out how to send back a
reply.  It won't work for everyone, but there are at least some
requests it has processed for people in UUCP-land and on mail-only
Arpanet sites.

I agree  with Keith  Petersen that  Info-Cpm should  be kept  free  of
binary postings.   Such postings  are usually  of interest  to only  a
limited number of people  and have no place  on a general  information
mailing list.  Keith has mentioned a number of alternative methods for
obtaining binaries and in fact provides access to many of the binaries
available at SIMTEL20 via a personal BBS which he maintains.

Let's knock off  the negative  criticism and concentrate  on the  many
possible solutions available to the network community.

Well, I don't know if they would let us poor old 8-bit people get
away with a newsgroup.

However, the cheapest method of distribution is still good old U.S.
Mail.  

For example, I have a "centipede" program that I wrote one weekend
years ago for my Osborne.  I've been thinking about cleaning it up
and giving it away to people, but how many folks could use it?

It seems that we shall always get the short end of the stick, so
I'd suggest that we rely on SIG/M and our local BBS sysops for
the bulk of PD programs.

I think that it should be okay to post source on the net, but binaries
are a little unwieldly.

Keith, I know that one can get UUCP for TOPS-20 systems, how about
you set up a few dialin ports and let people who want access set up
uucp accounts and turn on the server for them?  That way they pay
the shipping costs off-site and *everyone* gets access to the
SIMTEL20 archives again.

Subject: Re:  Modem info

I have been using this modem for about 8 months with *reasonable*
success.  It is missing two things:  a speaker and the S register.

The speaker I miss more than I thought I would.  It is annoying to
sit through several redials not realizing that the phone I am dialing
is busy.  Or worse, to mis-remember the number and finally pick up
the phone to hear someone going "Hello ... Hello?"

The S register is generally not needed.  However on the Hayes it
controls some things which can affect reliability of operation on
unusually strong or weak lines.

Conclusion:  I paid $69 for mine.  I would like the other features,
but I am fairly certain I would not like them several hundred dollars
worth.

Re:   CP/M software file server on Bitnet

I have made a few radical changes to the CP/M file server on Bitnet.
I will describe the changes first, then, for many of the newer people
on this list who never heard of the server, I'll review its use.

(1)  The server has been redesigned to use a disk "cache" for keeping
     only the most recently/frequently requested files online.  Requests
     for files not in the cache are deferred for overnight processing.
     The offline-to-online procedure is automated, but subject to
     delays; if a request cannot be satisfied in 5 days, the request
     is abandoned.

(2)  The archive is now more current than the former collection
     (which was dated 17 July 1987).  I will try to keep my server
     up to date with Simtel20, at least within a week or two.  This
     means very new files on Simtel20 will not be immediately available
     on my server, and the reverse for recent deletions.  Synchronizing
     my server with Simtel20 is a manual process I'll perform on a
     best-efforts basis.

(3)  THE SERVER IS STILL EXPERIMENTAL, AND INFORMATION ABOUT IT SHOULD
     STILL BE KEPT CONFIDENTIAL TO THIS GROUP.

(4)  The /PDDIR command is available for getting directory listings.

(5)  As before, if you have any comments, questions or problems with the
     server, direct them to FISHER@RPICICGE.BITNET (me), and not the
     Info-CPM mailing list.

*****************************************************************
*           Help information for the PDGET command.             *
*****************************************************************
     Selected portions of the SIMTEL20 public domain software
archives are available at RPICICGE.BITNET.  At present the
collections include the following directories:

     PD:<CPM.*>     -- The Info-CPM archive (CP/M machines).
     PD:<SIGM.*>    -- The SIG/M User Group archive (CP/M machines).
Planned:
     PD:<CPMUG.*>   -- The CP/M User Group archive.

Any of the files in these collections are available from the file
server LISTSERV@RPICICGE.BITNET.  The server responds to two commands.
/PDDIR requests a directory listing of files available in an archive,
and /PDGET requests a file from an archive.  The file server accepts
commands in both interactive messages or RFC822-style mail.  (On
VM and MVS Bitnet hosts, TELL LISTSERV AT RPICICGE... can be used to
send an interactive message.  Other Bitnet systems may have similar
facilities.  People on non-Bitnet systems must use the mail interface,
and must insure that the From: header represents a valid return path.)

****Note:  The server actually responds to many, many other commands,
           but none of them have anything to do with the archives.

The two commands have the following form:

      /PDGET  <format>  simtel.filename  < ( encoding >
      /PDDIR  simtel.pattern

The <...> mark things that are optional.

* "simtel.filename" specifies the name of a file to be delivered to the
    user.  Names are usually of the form "PD:<dir.subdir>name.type"

* "simtel.pattern" specifies a search pattern used in generating a
    directory listing.  The form of the pattern is like the filename
    mentioned above, but asterisks (*) may be used freely in the
    subdir, name, and type parts as wild cards (but not in the dir field.)

* "format" specifies the method of transmission to be used:

    NETDATA  -- suitable for transfer to Bitnet hosts that can accept
                files in IBM Netdata format.
    PUNCH    -- suitable for transfer to Bitnet hosts that can accept
                files but cannot decode the Netdata format.  Files
                are sent as 80-byte card-images.
    MAIL     -- suitable for transfer to hosts that can accept only
                mail or are accessible to Bitnet only through gateways.
                Large files sent via mail are split into several
                smaller files that the recipient must reassemble.
    If the format is omitted, NETDATA is assumed for Bitnet hosts
    and MAIL for all others.

* "encoding" specifies any special encoding of the file data:

    ASIS     -- suitable for hosts that can receive binary data.  The
                file is sent exactly as it is stored on my system:
                CP/M sector images, binary mostly.  ASIS may be used
                only with format NETDATA.
    UUENCODE -- suitable for hosts that cannot receive binary data.
                The file is sent uuencoded.
    TRANSLATE -- suitable for any host, but only when the file actually
                represents readable text.  The file is translated into
                character data format.
    If the encoding is omitted, files are sent ASIS if the transmission
    format is NETDATA, and UUENCODEd otherwise.

/PDDIR Examples:
================
(1)  The user is looking for the LASM program.
            /PDDIR  PD:<CPM.*>LASM.*

(2)  The user wants a listing of the full CPM collection.
            /PDDIR  PD:<CPM>

/PDGET Examples:
================
In each of the following examples the user wants the CPM.CRCLST file to
examine on his host and the UNARC16.ARK file to download to his micro,
both from the CPM collection.  Note that none of the examples have a
closing parenthesis!

(1)  The user is on an IBM host directly connected to Bitnet:
           /PDGET  NETDATA  PD:<CPM>CPM.CRCLST  (TRANSLATE
           /PDGET  NETDATA  PD:<CPM.ARC-LBR>UNARC16.ARK

(2)  The user is on a non-IBM host directly connected to Bitnet and can
     receive Netdata files:
           /PDGET  NETDATA  PD:<CPM>CPM.CRCLST  (TRANSLATE
           /PDGET  NETDATA  PD:<CPM.ARC-LBR>UNARC16.ARK  (UUE

(3)  The user is on a non-IBM host directly connected to Bitnet and can
     receive punch files:
           /PDGET  PUNCH  PD:<CPM>CPM.CRCLST  (TRANSLATE
           /PDGET  PUNCH  PD:<CPM.ARC-LBR>UNARC16.ARK  (UUE

(4)  The user is on some host somewhere:
           /PDGET  MAIL  PD:<CPM>CPM.CRCLST  (TRANSLATE
           /PDGET  MAIL  PD:<CPM.ARC-LBR>UNARC16.ARK  (UUE

That works both ways.  If submission and acquisition of programs is
strictly via FTP, then you'll lose a good part of the program sub-

Subject: DEC VT180 "Robin"  Questions
Message-Id: <4450@sol.ARPA>
Sender: info-cpm-request@simtel20.arpa
To: info-cpm@simtel20.arpa

I'm a long-time CP/M hacker, so I was called in recently to
help set up a DEC VT180 that had been donated to a local 
non-profit group.

The VT180 (also known as the "Robin") is basically a VT100 terminal
with a built-in Z80 board and external floppies that runs CP/M.
The donated one came with CP/M, a word processing program, and
a spreadsheet.  There was also a Users Guide and troubleshooting manual.

The main use would be as a terminal to a mainframe data base system.
It would also be hooked to a videodisk system so that video frames
could be called up under control of the mainframe (they already had this
working with a VT102 terminal).

We tried using the VT180 first as just a VT100 terminal.
This worked fine at 9600 baud, with one problem.
The setup screen lets you set the baud rate, parity, etc.,
for the communications port, but has nowhere to set them for
the printer port.  The manual doesn't say anything on this.

Question #1:  When used as a terminal, how do you set the
parameters of the printer port?

The mainframe software we were using sends the standard VT100
code sequence to cause messages to go out to the printer.
This works on our real VT102, but on the VT180 the messages
show on the video screen instead.  The manual doesn't list the control
codes obeyed by the VT180.

Question #2:  When used as a terminal, does the VT180 allow sending
messages to the printer?  How about doing a screen dump or printer
echo? (these use the shifted ENTER key on a VT102).

So, we tried CP/M.  This has a utility for setting the port parameters.
I got a copy of Kermit version 4.05
by downloading to an IBM PC and using Media Master to make
a VT180-compatible floppy.  Kermit worked OK, passing the
control codes on to the built-in terminal.  But it still
wouldn't send things to the printer under program control.  And we lose a few
characters after every Form Feed, presumably because it takes
so long to clear the screen.  I was able to send things to the printer
with the standard CP/M  Control-P key.

Question #3:  Is there any way to avoid losing characters
under Kermit+CP/M?  Any way to use the printer?

Question #4:  Is there some better communications program
for the VT180, which might solve some of these problems?

Thanks in advance for any help.

I generally agree.
I know several people who are presently using the Avatex 1200
with no problems.  

Four things to note:

1) While the 1200 is "not particularly  noise-sensitive",
   it is not tremendous at noise filtering either.
   Around Rochester there is a great variation in phone-line
   quality.  Avatexes work fine in some areas and not in others.
   However, it is at least as good as most $200 modems I have tried.

2) The 1200 has no speaker, which can be annoying when your
   calls don't go through--you don't know if the other end didn't
   answer, answered but wasn't a modem, or was a modem
   but wasn't recognized.

3) Several stores in Rochester sell the 1200 for $99 to $110.
   I have seen it advertised in _Computer Shopper_ as
   low as $88.

4) When you place your order, explain that you are not sure if
   this modem will work on your phone lines and be sure
   the store will give you a refund if it doesn't.

Hope this helps.

Subject: post binaries to each other - not the whole list !

I concur and support everything Keith has said in with regard to the
posting of binaries.  In addition to that, even CP/Mers aren't all
going to want the Centepede program for the Osborne-1 or whatever,
whereas the Osborne-1 people may think that's just dandy.

One good alternative that Keith is so nice to slave over is his Royal
Oak CP/M BBS - you can dial-in and up or download to this board at
no charge but the phone call; furthermore this makes it available
to the wider audience of the net(s) and Genie if warranted.

Of course if you'd like to get hexalated files circulated through the
INFO-CPM audience one alternative might be to make an announcement in
INFO-CPM that you have prepared a package for net distribution, and if
someone on the INFO-CPM list desires it via net mail they could send a
request to so-and-so directly (*not* on INFO-CPM) to receive a copy of
the package non-FTP from the originator, and that way it's between just
the people who want it.  Would such announcements be welcomed here Keith ?

Subject: Avatex Modem

Thanks to everyone (I had about a dozen replies) who provided opinions on the
Avatex 1200 (non-HC) modem.  The consensus seemed to ba that for the price it
was an adequuate modem.  The lack of a speaker was seen as an inconvenience
and the inability to program an S-register as a limitation for some special
applications.  One respondent had concerns about its performance on noisy
lines.  For the price US$88 it doesn't seem a bad deal.  In the end I decided
to go for a Smarteam 1200AT which was available for US$98, and seemed better
value for money, with none of the previous limitations (I hope!).

Subject: Notes on the LISTSERV file server.

Two blunders have been found and corrected for the file server in
Bitnet-land:

(1)  Under certain ill-defined conditions the return address was
     accidentally forced to all upper-case.  Some requestors (mostly
     in UUCP-land) would receive no replies.

(2)  A recent update to the CP/M file directory mis-tagged a few
     ASCII files as binary and some binary files as ASCII.  (The
     problem only effected the CPM.* directories.)  Requests for such
     mis-tagged files were answered with garbage.  I have corrected
     the directory, and flushed all of the misfetched files from
     the cache (at least I think I got them all).  If you received
     a garbage file, please retry the request AND let me know, too,
     so I can make sure the cache is clean.

Subj: Help in selecting the right Modula 2 needed
Hi everyone

we are contemplating buying a Modula 2 compiler for cp/m. It has to run on a
Z80 (although the processor is soon going to be a Z280). As far as I can see,
there are three compilers on the market (excluding the one for UCSD-p):
- Turbo Modula 2 (available from Echelon for $89.95),
- the Zuerich M2 compiler (available from W&A for $160), and
- FTL Modula 2 (also W&A for $49.95).
Now the question: who has some experience with those compilers (both good and
bad), and if you know them well: which one would you recommend ? I do not need
ROM-able code (but it may be handy some time), but i DO need linking with
assembler code (but not necessarily an inline-assembler). A nice user-interface
helps, but is not really necessary. Extreme compilation speed is not a must,
but the code should be fast and particularly tight (i expect some programs
to be limited by code size). Any bad or good advice is appreciated.

BTW, apologies to Keith Petersen and John S. Fisher. I was too harsh about the
"ARPA-net attitude of Simtel20". But i still think there should be more cp/m
file servers, both on BITNET and on other nets.

	I'm not sure what kind of disks I take...that is much of the
problem!  I am running a SORD M-68, a dual processor (Z80/68000)
machine that was made (and sold) exclusizely in Japan. My uncle
received it as a gift when he ran Citibank's computer operations in
Japan. When it came time for me to go to college, the SORD had evolved
from the latest to technology to paperweight mode, so my uncle passed
it on to me.

	In any case, I know that the disks I use are 5-1/4" floppys,
approximately 1MB storage. They are not compatible with IBM-PC disks,
if that is any help.

	I have C for my 68000 (running CP/M there), WordStar (I think
3.00) for my Z80, and then a batch of other stuff (including Basic)
for SORD's own OS running on the Z80. I don't have much information
about the internals.....  my uncle didn't have those manuals (he
didn't bother bringing them back since they were in Japanese!).

	Please let me know if you can think of any possible way that I
can get Kermit from the VAXen here (which can get it with FTP) to my
micro.

Subject:      Turbo & FTL Modula-2
To:           INFO-CPM@SIMTEL20.ARPA


  I have used both the FTL & Turbo Modula-2 Compilers. The FTL Compiler
appears to be very standard, and includes the source for all of its
libraries.  It can produce ROM-able code, and this was the main feature
we wanted it for here. We have a Z-80 SBC running here, with compiled FTL
Modula-2 in ROM.  The compiler & linker run at reasonable speeds.  The FTL
system also includes a editor that can link to the compiler & linker, and
the Modula-2 source for the editor can be purchased. The editor is
Wordstar like, is pretty nice. It can only edit files that can fit entire
in the RAM editing buffer, unfortunately. The FTL manual leaves quite a
bit to be desired, and does not cover the contents of the libraries at
all.  The best manual I found was to print the definitions files for the
Modula libraries. As for assembler support, you have to use there own
assembler, which I have never tried.

  As for the Turbo Modula-2 system, it is a more professional system with
the usual Turbo environment. (There are some nice extensions from the
Turbo Pascal Environment) The complier is also pretty fast, and
can produce either Z-80 (or 64180) machine code or a interpreted "M-
code". The Z-80 .COM file appears to be rather bloated, and will normally
be larger than the same code compiled by the FTL. There are also some
extensions such as WRITE & WRITELN which function like Pascal's, but are
very non-standard Modula-2. The system can link to Microsoft .REL files.
I have produced some M-80 assembler code, and had success in linking it
in with the Modula-2 system. This is a very nice feature. The biggest
problem & complaint that I have with the Turbo Modula system is the fact
the libraries seem to be non-standard in some aspects (mainly in I/O
operations). I get the feeling that the writers of the Turbo system
intended the Pascal-style WRITE & WRITELN extensions to be used mainly,
instead of the more normal Modula-2 Write.... procedures. The manual for
the Turbo system is very nice, and has complete library coverage.

I remember a discussion on this net in one of the unix newsgroups
where binaries were allowed to be posted about the possibilities of
malicious programmers putting in nasty surprises in a binary.  Some of
these binaries would work for a long time, performing useful
functions, but when some internal use counter reached some "magic"
number, BOOM, the program would turn ugly and start erasing all files
in all directories, or some such nasty thing.

I have also seen almost identical postings in various BB systems
around the country.

I, personally, wouldn't trust a binary unless handed to me by someone
I would trust with my login password.  I'd also have to know that the
person in question wrote the program whose binary I was running.

Let's hear it for source code!

I am planning to upgrade my homebrew Z-80 CP/M system
with a new Z-280 CPU and memory.  I am wondering:

Does anyone know any hobbyist-oriented chip retailers (JDR Microdevices,
etc.) that carry it?  I assume I can get from distributors like
Hamilton-Avnet, but they make it difficult if your'e not a corporate account.

Has anyone seen performance benchmarks for this chip?  I am especially
interested in the performance improvment given by the cache and burst
reads, and in tradeoff of processor vs. bus clock rate.

Can somebody tell me about Z80DOS?

I happened to get a copy of P2DOS a while back, and have just now gotten 
around to installing it (yes, it works!). The main attraction was having
timestamps, although the search path (I haven't implemented that yet) seems
also to be a good idea. The extra space freed up is a big help in supporting
additional ZCPR3 features.

I am aware of the existence of SUPRDOS, but this plethora of p/d BDOSes 
is annoying.. ZCPR3 was a whole lot easier to decide on for the lack of
"competition".

If somebody could post or e-mail me a comparison of SUPRDOS, Z80DOS, and 
P2DOS, I would be grateful. (Of course, if somebody would send me SUPRDOS
and Z80DOS, *I* would post the comparison.   only 1/2 :-)

Subject:  Z80 Modula-2

This is my first attempt to contribute to the CPM info so I am not sure if
I should reply to the board or direct. To be safe I will try both and risk
annoying people.

Z80 Modula-2: I have all three of the compilers mentioned as a result of a
project I am involved with. Personally, I have used FTL a little, Turbo a
lot and the Hoshstrasser compiler not at all. This does not reflect the
qualities of the compilers - it is simply chance.

My preference for Turbo over FTL reflects the success with which I managed to
get the editor working on my machine. The Turbo one works well, the FTL one
badly. Indeed I have started using VDO when using FTL.

On the subject of code size, Turbo only generated Z80 code as an option. It
interprets an intermediate code by default. This allows one to swap speed for
space.

I read the manuals for all three compilers last night to see how the tackled
the problem of ass lang interfacing. Only the Zurich compiler will allow an
ass lang module to contain variables which can be exported and accessed by
Modula-2 modules. The other two compilers limit you to exporting procedures.
All three permit the linking of REL files with the assistance of a utility.
The Modula-2 linkers supplied don't use REL file format themselves. The FTL
compiler comes with its own Z80 assembler.

I have not tried to interface assembly code with any of these compilers, but
after reading the manual I would select the Zurich compiler as the one I
would try first.

I hope this is of some help - if it gets to you!

Steve,
  Before you do anything drastic, suggest you try calling your local
Epson distributor (call Epson's widely-advertised number in Torrance if
you don't know where the distributor is).  They claim to have Geneva
parts; sometimes they do.  The dealers are, of course, useless.  Failing
that, try DAK and see if you can convince them to sell you the cables
without a computer attached.
   If that fails, two comments:
 1) If you can find the "round-type miniature" connector (Epson
variously refers to it that way and as a mini-DIN), then
    Round connector             DB25
    1 GND                   7
    2 TXD                   2
    3 RXD                   3
    4 RTC                   4 RTS
    5 CTS                   5
    6 DSR                   6
    7 DTR                  20
    8 CD                    8
    E CG                    1
 I think "E" is the shell, and can't account for the "RTC" label - it
may be a typo.  This information is copied out of the Technical Manual
for the PX-8.
 2) Your big problem if you decide to write one yourself will be getting
the little mini-pseudo-DIN round connectors.  The last time I looked
(about six months ago, I admit), couldn't find a source of supply.
However, Apple uses the same connector on their newer Macs, and sells an
expensive little converter from that connector to a DB9 (!)  female.  I
got one of those some months ago with the intent of building a backup
for my Epson cables (I've got one broken one, and am not impressed with
their quality or robustness), but have not been able to get around to
ringing it out and building the appropriate DB9->DB25 converter to
string together with it.  I have no particular reason to believe that
Apple's pinouts have anything to do with Epson's.  If anyone has figured
this one out, and has worked out the pin configuration of the DB9->DB25
converter that converts Apple's round-connector->DB9 converter into a
Geneva round-connector->DB25 serial, I'd be interested.

Subject: PIPing random files


Does this sound familiar?  An application program has a large random
file it creates at the beginning.  Various entries are filled, but by
no means all.  The person in question says he used to be able to
copy the files from one floppy to another using PIP with no problem.
Now he has a hard disk and when he copies the random file from floppy
to the hard disk (important note: NOT the same random file as he used
to copy between floppies), PIP "shrinks" the file, and the application
program throws up all over it.

I remember some years ago a problem with using PIP to copy random files,
but just added a "random copy" into my application program and forgot
about it.  Any solutions based on the limited info available?  Any
PD copy program that would NOT have this problem?

The problem may be that PIP is interpreting the file as a TEXT file, and is
truncating it at the first CTRL-Z (ASCII #26) character that it finds.
Try the following version of the PIP command -- it should probably solve the
problem:
     
     PIP destfile=sourcefile[O]
     
The "O" parameter tells PIP that the file being copied is a binary file,
and tells it to copy the ENTIRE file, even if it finds a CTRL-Z in it, which
would mean "END-OF-FILE" for a text file.  You'll still have to include
any "G" paraemter that is necessary for copying from one user area on the
floppy to a different user area on the hard disk.

Again I will send this both to the questioner and the board. I cannot help
you with a source of a suitable cable, but I can supply the pin-outs and in
the unlikely event of there being no source of a suitable plug in the entire
US of A, I have a spare I could mail you (for Christmas!)
The pin-outs:

Serial (not RS232):
1. Ground
2. Transmit data (PTX)
3. Receive data (PRX)
4. RTS
5.C CTS
6. PIN (status ready)
7. POUT (control signal)
8. -
E. Frame ground

RS232:
1. GND
2. TxD
3. RxD
4. RTS
5. CTS
6. DSR
7. DTR
8. DCD
E. Frame ground

the middle row of pins on the connector are not symmetric so you can tell
which way the number goes:

    1   2
   3 4   5
    6 7 8

I hope this helps.

Copying randomly-written sparse CP/M files is considerably more
involved than the sequential read/sequential write operation used
by PIP and nearly every other file copy utility; it is especially
tricky when the source and destination have different logical block
sizes.  When I wrote DATSWEEP for DateStamper I queried the list
about interest in adding that capability; no one expressed interest.
I know know of no general-purpose utility that can do it correctly.

Your best bet is probably to use the database program that created
the sparse file to copy it; I expect that all such programs contain an
internal copy command that will work (e.g. for dbase II, "copy to
<drive>").

Subject: Z80DOS, PZDOS and datestamp formats
In-Reply-To: Your message of 25 Nov 87 21:24:32 GMT.

Date: Mon, 30 Nov 87 09:46:49 PST

There is a resurgence of interest in CP/M 2.2-compatible bdos's;
at least two are under active development and not yet stable:  Z80DOS
and PZDOS.

Carson Wilson's doc file in the z80dos library tabulates the heritage
and major features of a number of variants; his z80dos is largely
derived from P2DOS.  Version 1.0 was released. 2.0 is being
beta-tested now and is available on some z-nodes.

Hal Bower and Cameron Cotrill have been perfecting PZDOS, also
derived from P2DOS; it is nearing release.

Automatic file time and datestamping is a feature many cp/m 2.2 users
already have by using DateStamper.  Z80DOS implements timestamps
in a manner similar to that used in cp/m 3 -- using 1 directory
entry every 4 for the stamps; however, its method conflicts
(destructively) with cp/m 3 file stamps.  PZDOS is aiming to give
the user the choice of either DateStamper or cp/m 3-type stamps.

The behind-the-scenes debate about timestamp formats is multifaceted.
(I'm the author of DateStamper; read with salt-shaker at hand).  Some
of the issues are:

The DateStamper format is the most portable -- DateStamper will run
with no bios or bdos modifications on virtually any cp/m
2.2-compatible system, including 8080 cpu's.  DateStamper includes
full create/modified/accessed times and dates.  But it requires the
most space -- 1.0 to 1.25 K.

The cp/m 3 and z80dos formats use up 1/4th of the directory entries,
require replacement of the bdos, but use no extra memory in a z80
system (8080 versions are not available).

A DateStamper disk can be transported to another cp/m 2.2
system and the datestamps will continue to be maintained on that
system if DateStamper is installed.  The other formats require a
compatible replacement bdos that supports their format.

It would be desirable to standardize on a single format for all of
cp/m 2.2; that would enable all of us to use all of the
timestamp-featured utilities that already exist (directory, filecopy,
disk catalog, unix-make, for DateStamper) and are being developed, and
to exchange fully-compatible disks.  But the jury is still out on
whether these dos's will evolve to that point...
