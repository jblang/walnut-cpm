Subject: Future of SIMTEL-20

It seems that the following should be repeated so that people begin to
understand.

1-It is not the existence of SIMTEL-20 that's in danger, but the job for Keith
to maintain it. Mirrors are not relevant here. What use would your library be
without a dedicated, gifted, person keeping it ALIVE? What use is there for
a mirror copy of a dead, not updated, undocumented library?

2-Even if CP/M has ceased to be considered useful by some people, that's NOT
the issue, again. SIMTEL-20 and Keith also give life to the flourishing MS-DOS
systems, and the same funding agencies certainly don't consider THAT dead.

3-Contrarily to what some people might believe, there is NOTHING such as money
to convince funding agencies of having made a wrong decision. I am willing to
bet that for prestige considerations only, the agency behind this decision
will not be able to swallow a flow of small cheques from individuals all over
the world. When I suggested to pay 50$/year for 10 years, I meant business,
and I mean it today. However, precisely because they deal with money, our
funding agencies know that they MUST recognize a need as soon as lots of people
are willing to pay for it from their own pocket.

So why wouldn't we stop arguing and just start sending cheques. PLEASE
ADVERTISE AN ADDRESS.

Actually, Curt, what you see as CPM56.COM is just standard notation for a 
56K sysgen image of your system. Had it been sysgened for 58K and then 
saved as a disk file (instead of placed on the system tracks), it would 
be usual to name the file CPM58.COM. The point is that as a sysgen file, 
there is no source for it.

What you need is the source of the BIOS for your Apple II (or is it 
Apple //e?). What kind of CP/M card have you got in the machine?

I did it again. Last weekend, at a garage sale, i bought a morrow md-3 for
20 bucks, and they threw in an md-2 for nothing. I had a md-3 boot disk
in my wonder basement, and the md-3 is solid.

I need some information on the md-3:

1) has anybody ever hacked hardware on this beast? added ramdisk?
   hard disk? 96 tpi drives? 3.5 inch drives? bitmapped graphics?
   vector floating point?

2) does any software exist that allows reading multiple formats like
   kaypro, televideo, 96tpi compupro?

3) anybody ever seen schematics?

finally, anybody want a free md-2? or a northstar advantage?
come pick them up in san francisco, or pay for shipping.

Message-ID: <XX00000043@cpc.actrix.gen.nz>

Hi, Netlanders!

Lots of good news for owners of Amstrad CPCs.  The first piece of good 
news is that I have (finally) got my hard drive working.  Only one 10 
Meg partition at the moment, but I'm working on it.  Currently the 
allocation buffer is in main memory (TPA), so I am reluctant to expand 
it out for 20 Meg.  The software for the hard drive is an RSX (CP/M Plus 
style), and seems to work fine (been working for about a week now).  If 
anyone wants a copy, mail me, and I will arrange somthing.  For those
that missed what I have done, the main piece of circuitry (and most 
expensive) is a hard drive controller board, which has a SCSI interface. 
I built a simple SCSI controller for the Amstrad that talks to this. 
Current throughput is about 30K/s - not that wonderful, but then I 
really should improve the SCSI controller (put a DMA chip on it).  As a 
side note, does anyone else using a hard drive on their CP/M computer 
know the sort of throughput they get?  

A piece of news from a little while ago. Someone down here (Bevan Arps) 
has written a replacement routine to control the RAM disk (Dk'tronics 
style), which seems to be much more bug free than the original 
dk'tronics ones.  He has also written some other clever software that 
works in with CP/M Plus, to add additional disk formats (including some 
400K and 800K formats, for people with 3.5" or 5.25" drives).  It also 
adds the PCW 40 track format (useful for moving stuff around).  And he 
has written a program that speeds up text output quite a lot.  If people 
are interested in these (mail me), I will arrange some way of getting 
them to you.  I don't particularly want to email copies out to everyone 
(email is charged by volume from here), but perhaps someone else can 
offer to distribute them?

The last piece of news, for the moment, is that I am working on a few 
ideas for the Amstrad hardware.  The first is adding a DMA chip (mostly 
for the hard drive above).  Other ideas include getting the Amstrad 
running in IM2 (vectored interupts), and daisy chaining the interupts 
(like Zilog suggest).  One other idea is to get four disk drives going 
on the Amstrad - not quite so important to me with a hard drive; but I 
do have another drive (800K) that I want to use. These ideas are all in 
the "thinking about them" stage, but results may come soon.

Anyone else out there still working with Amstrad CPCs please feel free 
to contact me.  I am (as seen above) interested in ideas for 
modifying/adding to the Amstrad hardware, and also interested in 
programming (mostly machine code and some C).

Subject: Graphics standard for small systems?
Message-ID: <1991Oct4.110905.4392@ips.oz.au>

Has anyone defined a suitable (portable?) graphics standard for small
machines?  Things like Sun raster file, X, GIF etc are all very well,
but a little bit overboard for what I want.  I'm sure that many CP/M
machines have graphics support, but I'll bet they all have their own
standard, possibly even depending on the graphics package they run at
the time.  Is there a suitable portable format, amenable to conversion
between other formats?

For example, the system here is a Microbee (if you've never heard of
it, don't worry, if you have you'll know what I mean) that has a character
addressable screen (80 x 24/25), but you get to define the characters in
a cell of 9 x 11 (I think) dots, thus permitting arbitrary graphics, as
long as your character map doesn't overflow (128 user-defined cells).
For all I know, other systems are dot-addressable etc.

What I'm looking for is a format that handles most hardware oddities,
but can run under CP/M without requiring whopping large arrays etc.
I guess I'll define my own, but I prefer to use an existing one.

Something else that occurred to me while I was typing this was some sort
of a protocol - a heavily cut-down "X" perhaps - that could be put into
terminal emulators running remote graphics packages.  E.g. you want to
display your favourite GIF file, stored on your works machine, on your
colour CP/M computer.  You would therefore run a viewer that translates
the GIF format into this protocol, and your terminal emulator would then
start hammering away on the colour maps etc.  Anyone done this?

[ Note for Microbee owners - TELCOM is all very well, but terribly limited
  in its capabilities.  What it really needs is a DECENT VT-100 emulator,
  a better way of implementing "chat" scripts, a "macro" capability, and the
  ability to run a program on the capture buffer, possibly leaving the
  results there for subsequent transmission.  An in-core editor would also
  be nice.  Am I asking too much? :-)  I'll see what I can write. ]

[ Note for non-Microbee owners - before you leap up and say "Why don't you
  run XYZ-TERM or something?  It has all that and more besides!" consider
  that the Microbee does NOT have a serial port - instead it bit-bangs
  on a Z80 PIO with a software UART!  I'm not even sure where it gets its
  timing from, it could be software loops for all I know - I haven't seen
  a BIOS listing yet - and I understand that the BIOS routines are slow
  anyway, hence programs like TELCOM have their own.  I have plans to
  install the 8530 SCC chip - there is provision for it - one day.  I have
  a few programs I would love to run, but they expect either a dedicated
  SIO chip with a port address, or an entry point that can send and fetch
  characters with a minimum of fuss - like, all 8 bits at a time! :-)
  There are also certain other oddities which I won't go into just now. ]

Sorry for the long-winded posting, but I prefer to anticipate any questions
that may be asked.

I can quite easily download from there to a pc, so how about from the pc to

I know nothing about the Memorex 550 floppy drives, but .....

The Xerox 820-II uses "standard" 5.25" low density (360K on the PC) floppy
drives.  Just make sure the jumper is set to drive the Motor On signal with the
Drive Select.  (Most low density drives have this jumper, though few High
Density drives do).

Note that the 820-II's  with 5.25" drives all came with Shugart 400 (Single
sided) or 450 (double sided) full height floppy drives, which were powered by
the CPU's power supply.  If you were to replace them with newer half height
drives, they would consume less power, and using the CONFIGUR utility, you can
set the Step Rate to 6 mS, vs. the SA400's 30 mS and SA450's 20 mS Step Rates.
While it's still slow using floppies, you will see a noticable speed up in disk
access time.

Hmmm, also note that the boot disks on the Xerox 820-II assume a 30 mS Step
Rate as default.  If you have the SA450 drives, you should change it to 20 mS
on your "working" system disk (don't touch the originals).  The drives will
make less noise, and will be a little faster.

As far as 8" drives go, they need to be compatible with the Shugart 800 series,
and many are.

I have been considering such a problem.  My answer/intentions
would be to use RMS's/MIT's SUPDUP protocol.  It has provisions for both 
text and graphics, and is reasonably extendable.  

	Relevant RFCS are:  
		749	Telnet SUPDUP-Output option
		747	Recent extensions to the SUPDUP protocol
		746	SUPDUP graphics extension
		736	Telnet SUPDUP option
		734	SUPDUP Protocol

	The intro from the original RFC is appended to this note.

Another choice might be a version of Bellcore's MGR window system, although
that might require too much space.

SUPDUP Display Protocol						    Page 1

INTRODUCTION

This document describes  the SUPDUP protocol,  a highly efficient  display
telnet protocol.  It originally started as a private protocol between  the
ITS systems at MIT to allow a user at any one of these systems to use  one
of the others as a display.  At the current writing, SUPDUP user  programs
also exist  for  Data  Disc  and  Datamedia  displays  at  SU-AI  and  for
Datamedias at SRI-KL.  The author is not aware of any SUPDUP servers other
than at the four MIT ITS sites.

The advantage  of  the  SUPDUP  protocol  over  an  individual  terminal's
protocol is that SUPDUP defines a "virtual" or "software" display terminal
that implements relevant  cursor motion operations.   The protocol is  not
built on  any  particular  display  terminal but  rather  on  the  set  of
functions common to all display terminals; hence it is completely  device-
independent.  In addition, the protocol also provides for terminals  which
cannot handle certain operations, such as line or character insert/delete.
In fact,  it is  more than  this.   It provides  for terminals  which  are
missing any set of features, all the way down to model 33 Teletypes.

The advantage over the TELNET protocol  is that SUPDUP takes advantage  of
the full  capabilities of  display  terminals, although  it also  has  the
ability to run printing terminals.

It is to be  noted that SUPDUP operates  independently from TELNET; it  is
not an option to  the TELNET protocol.   In addition, certain  assumptions
are made about the  server and the user  programs and their  capabilities.
Specifically, it is  assumed that the  operating system on  a server  host
provides all the display-oriented features of ITS.  However, a server  may
elect not to do certain display operations available in SUPDUP; the SUPDUP
protocol is far-reaching enough so  that the protocol allows terminals  to
be handled  as well  as that  host can  handle terminals  in general.   Of
course, if a host does not  support display terminals in any special  way,
there is no point in bothering  to implement a SUPDUP server since  TELNET
will work just as well.

I have a Heath/Zenith 89 computer with some software, but I am limited by
my hardware in running the software.  Does anyone have the old H77 external
dual drive unit that they would like to part with, or at a reasonable cost.
Need them to be the hard-sectored drives as well.  Or possibly the H37
controller card and a soft sectored drive combination.  Right now, I only
have one internal 100K hard sectored drive.  Thanks in advance!

a few times now i have been contacted by people wanting to populate
their basements with potential museum pieces. Yesterday, i paid my
semi-annual trip to Quinn's, and he had some interesting things that
i could not bring myself to buy, but i thought that maybe somebody
would want one.

1) mits altair, early model with ugly silkscreened front cover,
   point to glorious point wiring. looks seriously expanded
   with northstar cpu, als-8(!) in rom, about 10 boards in all.
   very good shape.  this one started it all. 
   he wanted 50 bucks for it.

2) processor technology sol-20 with helios disk. two complete.
   full docs. yes, this sucker has the infamous persci floppy
   with the linear voice coil positioner. great shape, the 
   wooden side panels are unscuffed. no boot disks.
   didn't ask for price, but my experience at the place tells 
   me he'd let them go for 40 each, your mileage may vary.

3) northstar advantage, 2 floppies. two complete.
   4 mhz z80 cp/m machine with bitmapped(!) graphics display.
   i have one of these in my basement already, but if you can
   stand hard sectored media, which i detest, these suckers
   could be yours for next to nothing ($20.00 ?)

4) the usual odd bits and pieces. 3 morrow md-11 mother boards,
   unknown condition; 3 z-64 satellite processors, look ok;
   i've never paid more than 5 bucks for a board at Quinns.
   note that if you don't know the place, you could easily
   blow an entire day prospecting.
   
the address (they will ship anywhere):

   Mike Quinn Electronics

I have no connection to the place other than fanatical customer.

Subject: BCPL for CP/M, MSDOS and Unix
Message-ID: <1991Oct11.020022.23256@syd.dit.CSIRO.AU>

There's a BCPL* compiler bootstrap kit with an INTCODE interpreter in
C.  It compiles on CP/M, MSDOS and Unix.  Executables for CP/M and DOS
are also provided.  You can get it from ftp.syd.dit.csiro.au
[130.155.128.3] in [.languages]bcpl.tar_z (VMS machine).  The kit is
based on the INTCODE bootstrap technique explained in the book BCPL:
The language and its implementation, Richards and another (not certain
of title, book's at home).

Remember, it's an interpretive system for bootstrapping purposes, so
expect a 10 to 20 times hit compared with native code.

The interpreter was done for fun so it's offered as is, no support,
USTL.  But if you do anything weird with it, do let me know.

*BCPL (Basic Combined Programming Language) is a system programming
language invented by Martin Richards. It's a typeless language with
only one data type, the machine word.  Some of its ideas have
influenced C.

A friend has been given an Epson Qx16 computer and a Spectrum Lx-80 printer.
Unfortunately the documentation for the _printer_ is missing.  There

If you can provide me with some info about these switch settings I would

This machine runs MSDOS  in addition to CP/M so if anyone can recommend
other appropriate news groups, please e-mail.

Message-ID: <1991Oct11.005950.23159@ecsvax.uncecs.edu>

I was recently given an Osborne Executive. Although the previous
owner thought it was working, it wouldn't boot. A quick check
showed that a card is apparently missing -- there is a long
connector on one end of the main board with nothing attached
to it.  This computer sat for a while in an open computer 
facility, and I suspect that someone ripped off the card
thinking it might have RAM on it.

Despite the fact that I once owned an Osborne Executive, I
no longer know what the card was that was taken. Anyone have
any clues? Any sources for the part?

None whatsoever. All I know is that it is a SuperMicro*32 w/o the expansion
port (for addition of external drives and such) model number 35-32
serial: 20126.
It is running CP/M 2.2 although the boot disk (floppy) has a bad boot
track.
It seems to have been made around '82 or '83.

I have the "SuperMicro Installation and User Reference Manual" but as for
documentation that is it.

Do you have any idea of the relationship between your Supermicro*32a and

Can you describe the size and shape of the circuit card(s)?  From running /
CPM-2.2, I assume a Z-80 processor, correct?

Are you able to look at the boot track to see what the problem is?

Good luck, my friend, and may the Force be with you.  DRI is in
the process of being bought out by Novell, and they probably
don't (and won't) give a rat's posterior about CP/M.  If I'm not

Try the 22DISK set ( shareware ) from SIMTEL20, in MSDOS.DSKUTL
directory. 
  One problem that might happen is that some cpm bios's need a
header block at the beginning of the disk to be able to recognize
the format of the disk.

  Have you tried formatting the disks on your TS803 and then using Media
Master to read/write them?

  Yup.  Uniform-PC by MicroSolutions.  I can point you at a vendor if

Subject: Re: Osborne Executive -- Part Missing
Message-ID: <1991Oct16.082033@IASTATE.EDU>

     The Osborne Executive has two long connectors on each side of the
    motherboard.  The connector on the left is for the memory board.  The
    board is positioned upside down on spacers.  If you lift the board off
    you will find two rows of 4164 rams chips and some TTL support chips.
    If you are missing this card your in trouble.  I am working on a
    replacement (see below), but I won't count on it right away.

    The connector on the right was used for the hard disk interface card.
    (Did I really say HARD DISK?)  Yes, a very few Osborne Executives had
    hard disks in them.  I have not seen one, but a co-worker said he once
    had one.  ( I am trying to find out more about this.)

    You didn't give very much information on the symptoms on why your
    machine would not boot.  I am willing to help you, but I'll need more
    information on the trouble.

    Since I used to service Osbornes (and still do) I have the service
    manuals and schematics to the Executive.  I am working on upgrading my
    Executive to add the additional four banks of memory, a larger boot
    EPROM to add additional routines to the BIOS and replacing the 5 1/4
    inch disk drives with 3 1/2 inch HD drives.  (The Executive was built
    with easily expandable hardware.)  I almost have the pc layout of the
    memory board done.  I am still trying to track down the Osborne
    Technical Reference manuals to get the BIOS listings to do the EPROM
    and disk drives.

    Even though I don't mind altering my Executive, I would like to find
    one I could experiment with.  If anyone has an Executive they don't
    want anymore I would gladly pay shiping and handling.

Wrong, pal.  There's no such thing as a "hard-sectored drive" in
the 5 1/4" world.  Besides, ALL  FM and MFM soft-secotred setups
have and use the said emitter-dectector pair.  Even the IBM PCs
use them. That's how the hardware finds sector 1 on each track.
In the world of soft-sectors, it's called the "index detector";
in hard sectors, it demarcates each sector and says where the
track starts/ends.

The only thing that determines whether the disk is hard- or
soft-sectored, save the drive controller, is the disk itself.

The only soft-sectored drives that don't use the index/sector
hole that I know of are Apple II, Commodore, and Atari.

> To be certain, look for a hard sector detector/LED combo near the

Pure and total horse-hockey.  FM and MFM soft-sectored systems
MUST use it to find the first sector.  In soft-sectored world,
like I said, it's called the "index sensor".  3 1/2" drives use
it too, but it's built into the drive and the diskette itself
doesn't need the hole because the diskette lines up to the hub in
EXACTLY the same place every time.  On the 5 1/4" disk where you
can't clamp onto a very specific place like you can with a 3 1/2"
and have it line up with the index, you MUST have part of the
indexing mechanism on the floppy diskette itself.  And don't tell
me it doesn't.  And if you try, tell me what that one hole on the
diskette (not the hub; the one where sectoring holes would
normally go) is for.

BTW, there's no such thing an an "IBM PC floppy drive".  There
ain't no such thing.  The interface is exactly the same as if you
had taken your disk drive from your Kaypro and plugged it into
your PC.

I've been working with someone on GEnie, and the standard TRS-80

Any takers?

Subject: forsale: Osborne I CP/M computer (and books)
Message-ID: <1991Oct18.181317.20661@cbnewsh.cb.att.com>

For sale: Osborne I CP/M computer, software, and books.  [[This is a
sort of a repost with a couple changes.  A few of the items from my
previous post were sold; I thought I had a deal for the rest, but it
fell through.]]

I won't describe the basic Osborne I configuration; if you don't
already know what an O-1 is, then you probably shouldn't go after this
offer.  It ain't no "compatible" PC!  On the other hand, if you're
interested and have questions, feel free to get in touch.

I got this machine in (probably) '82 and used it regularly for a few
years.  It's been closed up since '86, but I fired it up today and it
still works great.  I'd like to sell it to someone who knows what
they're getting into.  I need the space more than I need the money, so
make a fair offer and feel free to embellish in the hope that I'll go
for some low sucker price (but I do have my pride: it cost me $1300
[at the time a "fire sale" price] for the machine, plus all the extras
I accumulated along the way; naturally, that's a fantasy price these
days).  If you're part of some nonprofit organization that's already
using Osbornes (or at least CP/M machines), I would consider donating
this in exchange for a tax receipt.

FEATURES:
	blue case
	ROM version 1.44
	clean (really clean, not junky, not even dusty)
	external video jack [see VIDEO NOTE]
	double density disk upgrade
	all the original s/w and docs, even the original carton the
	     thing came in
	rear-vent fan thingy (I forget the official name of this)
	parallel printer adaptor cable
	joystick adaptor (this works with a couple of the games I
	     have, but today I can't find the adaptor itself; if I
	     find it later, it's yours)

VIDEO NOTE: The external video output is part of the 52/80/100 board
(Osborne ScreenPac), but the rest of the board never worked right.
Still the external video jack works, and you can have both the
built-in monitor and an external monitor working at the same time; no
funny plug to play around with.  I also have the "exmon" adaptor (the
funny plug that is used to switch between internal and external
monitors); I don't recall if it works.  I have an amber monitor that I
used to use with this.  It's a USI PS3.  It used to be considered
hi-res, but certainly wouldn't be today.  If you want the monitor,
make an offer.

SOFTWARE:  In addition to the stuff that all Osborne I's came with
(WordStar 2.26, SuperCalc, CBASIC, MBASIC) and a lot of mid-80's
vintage public domain stuff, here's some other (mostly commercial)
software that I got over the years.  This is all legally acquired and
I still have complete original documentation for most of it.

	The Micro Link (v 1.1) [comm program]
	Personal Pearl [relational database program, 7 disks!]
	Media Master (v 3.00s) [foreign disk reader/writer]
	Small MAC [macro assembler]
	Z80ASM (SLR Systems)
	Nevada FORTRAN
	Z80 Cross Assembler (2500AD Software)
	MIX Editor
	MIX ASM Utility
	SCG22 [source code generator for CP/M 2.2]

Besides all this, you get to stroll down memory lane and relive early
microcomputer history as you look at the odd collection of disks and
sleeves in the 50-100 other disks that come with it.

I also have a ton of documentation for the Osborne and for CP/M in
general:

	Osborne I Technical Manual (includes ROM/BIOS listings)
	Osdex (index to O1 user's manual)
	Sams Computerfacts: OCC1, OCC1A (schematics, etc)
	Don't (Or How to Care for Your Computer)
	Microprocessor Interfacing Techniques

	More TRS-80 Assembly Language
	8080A-8085 Assembly Language Programming
	Programming the Z80

	The Programmer's CP/M Handbook
	The CP/M Plus Handbook
	Osborne CP/M User Guide
	Mastering CP/M
	CP/M Operating System Manual (official Digital Research version)

	C Primer Plus (this book sucks)
	CBASIC User Guide
	Payroll with Cost Accounting (includes CBASIC source listing)
	Best of Interface Age, Volume I, Software in BASIC
	Understanding FORTH
	Pocket Guide to FORTH

	Quick and Easy WordStar
	Proportional Spacing on WordStar
	The Small C Handbook
	SuperCalc Primer


I'd prefer to get rid of it in a big heap, but I'd consider doing it
in pieces.  So, like, make me an offer for some or all of this.  Email
preferred, but my daytime phone number is below.

There is quite a bit of online documentation on SIMTEL20
in the CPM sections. There are help files, and rewites of
the command line processor, the BDOS and many samples of
BIOS code. If you want function calls, just look at the
docs for MSDOS 1.0 :) .
  If you want to try out an authenic non-souped up CP/M 2.2
online, rlogin into hopf.math.purdue.edu (128.210.3.18) as
"cpm" . This will put you into a real CPM running on a

Not an uncommon problem.  Format the diskette on the native machine
and then write to it on the PC.  Media-Master is a piece of dog-meat
anyway --- use 22disk or Uniform.

The folks at Sydex (creators of 22disk) told me that the FDC chip
used in most PC's cannot read or write single density with sector
size of 128b.  Supposedly a flaw in the chip logic.  I have no way
to verify this, and just pass it along as a potential topic of
discussion.  Does the TeleVideo TS803 use SD 128b sectors anywhere
on a diskette????

Sure, either MicroSolutions' UniForm, or Sydex 22Disk will do the job for

The manual for the C-128 has a coupon for the CP/M 3.0 disks and 
DRI CP/M 3.0 manuals.  The price for the disk and manuals is

 Re: Wow! a CP/M BBS!!!
 
 Wow! That is all I have to say! I haven't seen a CP/M BBS in a 
loooong time!!  As an introduction, I am living in Fla, and can 
only call sporadically... but call I will! I will even upload, 
seeing that I have access to several other BBS' around this great 
country of ours <snicker>. I am running on a Kaypro 2 with dual 
195k FD's, und am communicating using a modified version of MEX 
4.1.
    
 I will have questions, seeing as how I am a new CP/M user, and I 
will probably drive you crazy with feedback and questions, but, 
that's the way I am...  To get to the heart of my reason for 
contacting anyone I can, I am looking for some way to put a pair 
of 360k FD's into a Kaypro2 without killing my computer or 
getting LOTS of BDOS errors... is it the BIOS, or my software??? 
I needs to know!!! If you can help me with this, and carry what I 
need, I will purchase said equipment from you!!! I am also 
looking for a way to connect a 10 meg HD to this monster (same 
question)... I already cut the holes into the case for the FD's 
(they are full height) and would appreciate an answer FAST!!! I 
also have put off purchasing a Kalok 10 meg HD 'til i could find 
someone who isn't ashamed of knowing more about CP/M than the 
fact that it is an operating system... I am looking forward to 
this, as are a few friends running under 3.0 on commie 128's (I 
am on 2.2).
                      Thank you VERRRY much,

I would suggest that you try formatting the disk on the TeleVideo 
and see will the PC-clone then read and write to/from the disk.
    
>1: What is wrong?
    
It could have something to do with the size of the read/write 
heads on the drive.  Does your PC-clone have 360K drives?  If 
not, the heads are narrower thus making alignment more critical.  
As least that's what I've been told.

UNIFORM-PC can do it.  I think it is priced around $65-$70.  I

Message-ID: <2@blkbox.UUCP>

The Black Box BBS, formerly a Fidonet based system, is now on Usenet and is
available 24 hours a day, 365 days a week, with a full newsfeed.  The two
lines are 713-480-2686 (V32/V42/V42bis/HST) and 713-480-2685 (2400 MNP-5).

I am a long time CP/Mer, from waaay back in the 70s, and am planning on including a section of my favorite CPM programs.  I will also continue to support MSBBS, the Fidonet BBS I wrote in Turbo Modula-2.  

The old Kaypro bit the dust, and I have replaced it with a 486, SCO Open Desktop, and am really enjoying it.  In fact, I would like to give my old CP/M systems a good home.  If you want one, give me a call voice at 713-480-2684.

1 Televideo 816, 32 meg hard drive, up to 16 users, $250
1 Televideo 802, 2 floppies, 2 serial, 1 paralell, $100
1 Televideo RWP, *4* Z80's, each with 2 serial ports, perfect for a BBS! $200
2 broken Televideo 800s, no floppies (diskless), $25/each    

If you buy allof the above, $500.  Full docs and LOTS of software will be
included, along with LOTS of spare boards, chips, etc.  The system currently 
is set up for 5 terminals, the 802 and the RWP with 4.  Just add more and
turn them on in the config file for up to a 16 user CP/M system! 

I also have a SWP ATR8000, with 4 floppies (2 5 1/4" ds/dd, 2 8" ds/dd), also with full docs, tons of disks, et al, $300.  If you want the COPOWER 88 ramdisk
(1 meg) which can also run CP/M 86 and MS/PCDOS (I have both for it), $200.
It is GREAT for exchanging from CP/M to DOS, as you can use the DOS2CPM, and
CPM2DOS and CPMDIR commands in DOS to move files around!  Full 973K TPA in DOS!!due to the lack of screen memory!

Buy both the ATR and the Copower and I will throw in an Atari 800 and a 
monitor (b/w) so for $500, you get a full system.

Call at 713-480-2684 voice for more info.

The TeleVideo 800A is a workstation, and as such you would have 
to use the fileserver (which ever one you have) to load a 
properly configured comm pgm to run a modem off of its RS-232 
port.  I think the 800A uses the TeleVideo 802 overlays for IMP 
and MEX.
   
You should also be able to configure your 800A as a terminal 
(dip switches), connect it to the terminal port on your 
fileserver, and then run a modem off of the CPU's RS-232 port.  
Of course the comm pgm. must be properly congigured here also.

A quick look at the schematic of a PC FDC controller would tell you
that regardless of the chip's logic, correct or not, the PC FDC
controller can't read or write single density anyway, since there is
no logic to change clock frequencies or modulation.

The documentation for 22DISK describes an eay hardware modification
to standard PC floppy controller boards to enable single density 
READING. It uses un-used extra logic gates on the board to detect
MFS/FM off the previously unconnected pin on the 765 chip.
   I've tried the mod. It worked to read Heath SD softsectored
disks.
   The documentation mentions that WRITING would require
timing compensation which is not accomplished by the easy mod.
   I have not tried any 8" drives on the PC.

True, all drives use the emitter-detector pair.  Wrong, there is
such a thing as a "hard-sectored drive" in the 5 1/4" world.

>use them. That's how the hardware finds sector 1 on each track.

Exactly, and that is the difference.  For the "hard-sectored drive"
the drive had on-board logic to determine where the start of the track
was, and provided *TWO* index outputs on the interface connector.
One index output indicated the sector pulses, one indicated start of
track.  This is not to say that most standard drives won't work with
hard sectored disks, given the right controller.  BUT, I have seen
drives that tested "ready" by looking for index timing, that wouldn't
ever come "ready" if you used a hard sectored diskette in them.

>BTW, there's no such thing an an "IBM PC floppy drive".  There

While it is true that the interface for an "IBM PC floppy drive" is
exactly the same as other 5 1/4" drives (assuming DSDD), there is one
significant difference.  Many of the lower cost floppy drives manufactured
now have no jumpers to configure device select, motor control, etc.
In other words, it will work only if it is OK with you that all drives
are selected with DS1 and are configured for "select with MOTOR ON".
These I would certainly call "IBM PC floppy drives", since if I was
designing a system, or using it in an old Kaypro, those are not the
interface configuration options I would select.  Then there is the
matter of the 5.25" HD floppies, which DON'T have "exactly" the same
interface as a Kaypro, and nobody had ever heard of them before they
appeared on the IBM AT.  I would argue that those would also be called
"IBM PC floppy drives".

Minor Point:
  Actually, C= does use the index/sector hole when performing the initial
format.  After that it uses some bytes that indicate the start and end of each
sector.

Dave, you helped me on my system awhile back, and as I am a novice with my 
system, you did most everything for me.  It works, although it doesn't seem to 
handle all the vt100 codes very well, and that's probably due to the notorious
2 character drop (time taken for 'new line' redraw to take place - on a 2400 
baud modem).   Let me know what you need, and hopefully I can help you back.

I'm just up the street from you now, in Sacramento, so calling won't be a 
problem like last time.

And I have to disagree with some of Erik Lindbergs comments.  :-)

The drives or BIOS?  It's true that what you said is *PART* of how the 8" and
5.25" High Density drives test for drive ready (assuming that the 5.25" HD
drives even has the Drive Ready option), but note that most 5.25" do not even
HAVE the signal (I have never seen one that does).  However, a BIOS that tests
for the drive being ready be testing the index hole timing is the BEST type of
BIOS for substituting 5.25" HD drives for 8" drives!!!  :-)

Hmmm, I have seen this trend in 5.25" High Density floppy drives, but not on
the typical "360K" drive.  On High Density drives there are usually two jumpers
to select DS0 and DS1, instead of four jumpers.  I have never seen one with no
jumpers, though that does not mean they don't exist.  In addition, your correct
in saying there is usually no way to configure MOTOR ON to work with Drive
Select.

I have yet to see a "low density" drive with less than four drive selector
jumpers (does not mean they don't exist though).  In addition, there is
*usually* a way to configure MOTOR ON to be driven by DRIVE SELECT, though you
might have to look for it.  I have a pair of Chinon "low density" drives (you
wanna talk about cheap drives), and by following the MOTOR ON trace, I quickly
found where I needed to solder a jumper between two pads to tie MOTOR ON to
DRIVE SELECT.  While these drives did not provide jumper pins, the ability was
still there.

In any case, many non-PC 5.25" controllers already have a MOTOR ON signal,
unless the controller is meant to drive both 5.25" and 8" drives.  Even then
though, it still might have a MOTOR ON signal.

> Then there is the matter of the 5.25" HD floppies, which DON'T have

The interface differences are so little that they should not matter, unless the
Kaypro did something *VERY* non-standard.  The signal pins that the Kaypro
should actually be using are pin-for-pin identical!  There are different
reasons that the HD drives do not "plug-n-play", but it's not because of the
hardware signal interface.

BTW: The differences on the HD drives are pin 2, SPEED SELECT, and Pin 34 DRIVE
READY/DISK CHANGE.  There are "no connection" pins on the "low density" drives.

> and nobody had ever heard of them before
> they appeared on the IBM AT.

Again, not true!  They had been around for several years before the IBM AT used
them.  It's just that they were never POPULAR (read inexpensive) until the AT
used them.  They were developed to replace the 8" drive, but by the time they
got to market, the 8" drive was already dead, and everyone was using the 5.25"
"mini-floppy" drives.

> I would argue that those [High Density Drives] would also be

Feel free, but I am not sure why you would want to.  I have a pair of them
running on a Xerox 820-II.  Fuji Xerox used them in their workstations (which,
by the way, are older than the IBM AT), and I have seen them in other non-PC
computers.  Personally, I would NEVER call a floppy drive an "IBM PC floppy
drive" unless it ONLY worked in a PC and nothing else.  :-)  I know of no
drives like that.

That information is correct and is generally the cause when one cannot 
use a floppy formatted on a PC using one of the common tools (Uniform-PC, 
22DISK, Media Master, etc). There are two solutions. Get a floppy 
controller for the PC that can write single density or format on a native 
machine.

It should be noted that many CP/M formats will format the first track in 
single density and the rest in double. The Xerox 820 series all did this. 
Uniform-PC handles this format very well once the disk is formatted in a 
machine that can write that first track.

My experience is that if the parameters of the hard disk of the
replace drive exceed those of the unusable drive in terms of number
of heads and cylinders, then it should work, although at the lower
capacity. I imagine that the typical old 10 meg drive from XT's with
320 cylinders and 4 heads would work. Clarence Wilkerson

i've come across this machine made by Xerox.  it's got a Terminal module that's

Comm, Printer, Keyboard, and Disk Drives.

the disk drive module, is unfortunatly shot. (more specifically, the Shugart 1004
hard disk is shot.. it's been blowing up fuses and power supplies left and right.
needless to say, i've trashed it)   the floppy still works.  anyways..

the CPU module/Terminal thingy has  Xerox v5.00 (c) 1983  rom monitor.  
I've managed to figure out most of the commands.. like assemble, insert, dump
save, load, etc.     it's also got a command H)ost Terminal.   this thing would
make a very nice little terminal if only i could change baud rates.. it's stuck
at 300 bps. 


Could someone please tell me 
	a)	How to change the baud rate on this thing. 
	b)	the commands for the rom monitor

I would say that there is, indeed, no such thing as a "hard sectored **drive**".
What was hard-sectored or soft-sectored was the **disk**, not the drive.  For a
long time I used 5-1/4" dsdd drives with the "hard sectored" controller in my
Heathkit, then moved those drives to a PC clone.

What you describe is a Xerox DEM-II. It is based on the Xerox 820-II, 
with the motherboard in the bottom of the terminal cabinet and an 
external drive cabinet about the size and shape of a PC, which holds a 
floppy and a hard drive. The parameters for the hard drive are set in the 
ROM bios (tracks, heads, etc.) so you will need to replace the Shugart 
100-4 with a similar model. Once up and running, it makes a nice little 
10MB CP/M box.

The Xerox CP/M line was based on the Ferguson Big Board, as was the 
Kaypro. Good lineage. The video attributes between the Xerox and the 
Kaypro are different, but port assignments and other machine-specific 
things are the same. A terminal program configured for the Kaypro will 
work out of the box on the Xerox.

Is it worth your while to get the OS for this box? I would say so. At one 
time, these units were hot tickets. You might ask Lee Bradley who runs 
his bbs on a DEM-II if he will give you a boot disk. Lee's board can be 
reached at (203) 665-1100.

The command to switch the terminal to a higher baud rate:

     At the opening prompt (before hitting H for Host Terminal),
     enter Bn where n equals the baud rate desired.

     5 =  300 baud
     7 = 1200 baud     E = 9600 baud
     A = 2400 baud     F =19200 baud

Then hit H to enter the host terminal.

I could not figure out a return address for this message, and thus am sending
it to the whole group.  I think the original message was written by Erik
Fichtner?

What you have is a Xerox 820-II.  5.00 ROM was the last version of ROM for this
computer, and supports the Disk Expansion Module (DEM) which is not what you
have.  :-)

Send me a mail note, and I'll give your more information on the beast.  If
you'll pay shipping, I'll send you some documentation for the computer,
including the monitor ROM documentation which explains how to do things like
change the BAUD rate, etc.

I believe Chris is incorrect in the statement made above. What you have is
a hard/floppy disk system. The floppy is probably a Shugart 851 8" double
sided double density drive but it could be a Shugart 801 8" single sided
double density drive. The hard drive is (was) a Shugart 1004. The 1004 is 
an 8" 10 megabyte drive that requires a DTC controller board. If you had a
dual 8" floppy assembly you could plug it into the back of the floppy/hard 
drive assembly and have a total 3 floppies and 1 hard drive.

If interested, I have 2 or 3 1004s to sell. I would like to get $50.00 plus
shipping each.

Subject: Adding a hard disk

Hello all,

I own a CP/M computer (of course), you may never heard of. It was built
in Japan and sold in Germany by a firm called Triumph Adler. It was
named "alphatronic PC" here and "Royal alphatronic" in the UK. It was
never intended to add a hard disk to this machine. But I would like
to upgrade my system from CP/M 2.2 to ZCPR 3.3 and adding a hard disk
too, would be nice. Some month ago, I read a notice mentioning that
there exists a kind of SCSI card for systems like mine. They claim,
that one needs only to remove the Z80 chip, then plug in that board and
then put in the Z80 chip in that board. Do somebody know where I can
order such a board, preferably with an appropriate hard disk and
the software? I have the BIOS for my system, so to add software is not
the problem.

                                  Thanks a lot and best regards

Sounds akin to a modified saying, "a $5,000 computer will protect
a $0.10 fuse by blowing first", right?  This is mainly if you're
either reading heavy current draw, or if worse comes to worse,
your switching supply crowbars.  I've worked on an XT motherboard
where the power supply was crowbaring due to the fact that a
capacitor, and interestingly enough, a tanty, was shorted out.
All supplies went dead the instant the supply was fired up.

OK, I didn't now that.  I blithely assumed that the Commodore
didn't use the index holes.

My apologies to the person I said my original comments to.  I had
forgotten about the drives like the Micropolises (or was that
Micropoles?  :-) ).  Anyway, I have little, if not no, experience
with hard-sectored systems, even though I own part of one (an old
North Star).  But with the Apple, I know for absolute sure that
all the sectoring, in fact, every bit of the formatting including
how to deal with the stepper motor, including finding sector zero
is done entirely in software, in Apple's infinite wisdom to make
everything as proprietary as humanly possible.  I know that well
because I own several, and I have CP/M for it in several forms.

Any Double sided Double density (i.e. PC 360k) disks will work fine.
A pair of half height Teacs will fit in one slot and you could cover over

Woah. Brings back memories. That thing was such a performance pig I just
chucked it. Took 2 minutes to do a 'DIR' on an empty disk on a Sun 3/160.

The emulator itself is just that - an emulator. If I remember right,
upm loaded in a .HEX file, relocated it to the top of memory (after
figuring out how much to leave for BIOS and buffers), and jumped to
$8000.

The relocator assumed the code was loaded in at 0, with all the jumps
set to run at location 0. The relocation bitmap started at $4000, and
a length byte was at $FFFF, which was the number of pages in the
relocated chunk. The bitmap was one bit per byte of relocated code.
If the bit was 1, then an offset was applied to the byte as it was
copied into place, otherwise the byte was copied verbatim.

The BIOS jump table was 76 C9 00 76 C9 00.... That is, a
bunch of HALTs, then RETs. The idea was that a HALT caused the emulator
to return to the C program that called it, which then examined
(PC%64)/3 to see which BIOS call it was. It then performed the desired
BIOS function (in C), incremented PC, and jumped back into the emulator.
The rest of CP/M (BDOS, CCP) was Z-80. That way, someone
could have made ZCPR for it if they wanted. I couldn't distribute
BDOS/CCP since they're still subject to Digital Research's copyright.
Which is a shame, since DR no longer distributes CP/M. IMHO if
they're not going to sell it, they ought to give it to someone
who will, or make it PD. But that's another story.

If this is indeed the DTC controller, you might consider getting a
DTC 510 or similar to replace it. The hardware interface is the same,
judging from what was used in the Heath-Zenith H89 H67 interface.
The DTC510 runs std. 5.25 inch hard drives. The DTC520 has a built-in
floppy controller for 5.25" drives. Weird Warehouse used to sell these
pretty cheaply.

Depends on the cause of failure of the diode.  If it fails because of an
overvoltage condition, it will likely fail open.  If the cause of failure
is excess current, it will almost always fail *shorted*.

  Simple sequential testing will fail miserably on simple things like
shorted/open address lines (like bad sockets, or solder bridges...)

Suggest that you do a complete backup to floppy disk first.  Then reinstall
the boot track and see if that helps.  If not, you should consider
reformatting the drive and reinstalling boot track and files.  If that 
doesn't do it, there is a possibility that the controller has drifted out
of spec.  I haven't got an answer for that one!

Can't speak to 5.25" hard-sector drives of my own knowledge.  However, with
the old Shugart 801/851 drives, you had to strap the electronics differently
for hard or soft sector compatibility.

Most any half high 360K floppy drive should do the job for your Kaypro 4.
*BUT* be sure that the drive has jumpers for drive selection which you
need in the Kaypro.  Some of the recent drives have done away with them
because PCs make the selection with the twist in the ribbon cable.

No need to do that. The emulator handles Z-80.
Now the emulator wasn't fully debugged, so there
aren't any guarantees. I don't even have the source
anymore.

Had a lot of fun with that upm, hacking for it's own sake.  As I reall
there were amazingly few errors, like xoring swapped with an and in one
of the series, and some incorrect flag states, I forget.  

On some of the fast machines it will give respectable performance, 
especially for disk intensive tasks.

The only way I was able to debug it properly while hacking for all
the speed I could find was to set up test programs on a real Z80 CPM
machine, dump the console output back to unix, then run the same program
on the emulator, and use diff to munch the megabytes.  That sure zeroed
in on some obscure errors in a hurry.

In the end though, all I really wanted was to bring unix tools to the
CPM code, compile, and debug cycle.  To that end all it took was
some utilities to switch the conin/conout from the real console to
the serial port and back, a simple file transfer utility, and then a
rudimentary scripting utility on the unix side.  It's a lot of fun
to type "make" and dog that little puppie. Meanwhile, in another window,
you can work on the next step.  It's like revenge for all those hours
spent plinking a little and waiting for the stinker to be ready for me,
"Mush! Mush! Spin that floppy, compile that code!  No rest for you!
Now mush, mush!"
