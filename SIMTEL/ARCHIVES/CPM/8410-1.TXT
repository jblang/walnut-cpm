Message-ID:  <841001055043.447509@HI-MULTICS.ARPA>

I am experiencing severe difficulties trying to implement "named
directories" under ZCPR3.  I suspect that there is a bug in LDR v1.0 (27
Feb 84).  The logic at "setdata:" after the call to "getndr" appears
incorrect.

Also it appears as though the named directory buffer must be a multiple
of 256 bytes.  This is not mentioned in the installation procedures.

I have the command line buffer following the named directory buffer and
I think it is being overlayed by the named directory.

There was no source supplied for z3lib.rel or vlib.rel from SIG/M which
makes troubleshooting a bit more difficult.

MKDIR had to be re-assembled as the supplied com file wouldn't write the
NAMES.NDR file without aborting.

In order to link the utilities properly the following command was used
instead of the one specified on page 91 of the installation manual:

L80 /P:100,$1,Z3LIB/S,SYSLIB/S,$1/N/U/E

instead of:

L80 $1,Z3LIB/S,SYSLIB/S,$1/N,/U,/E

THREE extra zeroes were placed at the beginning of the utility if the
recommended L80 command string was used from page 91.

If someone could shed some light on the above it would be greatly
appreciated.

Please send explicit mail as I cannot ftp from simtel20.

Thanks

	All of the problems you reported (with the possible exception
of the LDR problem - will look at it) have already been reported and
posted in the ZCPR3 Newsletters.  I just sent you copies of the first
5 newsletters ... hope this will help.  There is a lot of data here.

	The route which has been taken in problem reporting and
tracking, namely thru Echelon and the newsletters, has worked out
nicely from my point of view.  I see only one report on each potential
problem (with the exception of my DDN mail) and don't have to respond
to 20 or more questions about the same problem -- the responses are
posted in the newsletters, and the ZCPR3 user community can read them.
Additionally, Echelon, thru its (1) posted address, (2) posted
telephone number, and (3) electronic bulletin board provides a
convenient method of communication which is supplemented greatly by
its newsletter.  I really urge the ZCPR3 community to take advantage
of this service and read the newsletters.

	I will be posting newsletters 6 and 7 soon.  The bug reports
are going down, and more and more newsletter material is oriented
around new products, a review of the ZCPR3 system (highlights of
programs), and other useful tidbits of information.

	I have mentioned several times that the book is coming out ...
take heart, for it really is happening.  I see it mutate time and time
again these days.  For your information, there are two literary
editors working on it (actually, they have finished) and one technical
editor (Chris Terry, formerly of Microsystems).  I feel that Chris'
inputs have really been helpful, and he is currently in control of the
StarIndex copy of the book.  He is reviewing and adding a section on
the auto-installing Z3-DOT-COM to it.  The next pass is to send me the
StarIndex copy for one last review and run thru StarIndex, and then I
will send the final to him for printing and forwarding to the
publisher for typesetting.  We are approx 1 week behind the last
posted schedule right now, but you can see that there is not much left
to do.

	Oh, one last thing, remember that all sources are supplied to
the ZCPR3 System.  The phase 2 release included complete sources to
Z3LIB and VLIB, as well as several new tools, such as VFILER and
VMENU.

In-reply-to: Msg of 18 Sep 1984  03:34-MDT from cpm at wpafb-afita

Hi, Kirk,

	Very good message ... it looks like you anticipated every
possible response (within reason -- ie, you left off my nuking
Dayton).  Anyway, as you have already surmised, there is really little
I can do for you from here.  At a minimum, source to the BIOS is
required to analyze the problem, and the one MD-2 I accessed before
(which is now in Australia) was one of the first, to which Morrow was
willing (at the time) to provide the source.  For any reasonable,
non-cookbook installation of ZCPR2 or ZCPR3 in the conventional sense
(ie, on the system tracks), we can't do anything without the source to
the BIOS.  Then, it really is a rather simple task to modify the cold
boot routine to initialize the buffers, to select the desired options
in the Z3BASE.LIB file, etc, and then to bring up the resulting ZCPR3
System.

	Unlike with ZCPR2, ZCPR3 adds another alternative --
Z3-Dot-Com ($49 from Echelon).  This is an auto-installing ZCPR3 that
(1) takes just a few minutes to run in order to create Z3.COM and (2)
does not require the user to do anything other than select a few
options.  No BIOS source, no worry about ROM versions, etc.  Just
install and run.  Then, once Z3.COM is created, you may want to set up
your auto-boot program to issue the command "Z3" in order to come up
automatically in ZCPR3 (STARTUP in ZCPR3 will run other things for
you), and you have a system that runs ZCPR3 from cold boot.  It seems
to me like $49 is a small price to pay for the convenience and lack of
pain.

	I feel that this is the best advice I can give you.  This is a
solution to your installation problems.

	Also, for the audience in general, Frank Gaude' informed me
tonight that Z3-Dot-Com has been brought up on the Compupro 8/16 and
the Z-100.  He does not have much feedback yet from the users, so
there may still be some problems, but he feels good about the current
version.

Article-I.D.: lanl-a.13861

I am now the proud owner of an HP Laser Jet Printer.  The print quality
is fantastic.  Before I embark on a modification of Wordstar to let me
use micro-justification with it, I thought I would ask if anyone has 
already tackled the problem.  The difficulty is in setting the Horizontal
and Vertical motion Indices (HMI & VMI).  As configured for daisywheel
printers W* sends <esc> <char> <binary number>.  The Laser Jet needs
<esc> <char> <char> <Ascii representation of a number> <char>.  Not only
is the numeric info imbedded in the string but it must be converted to ASCII!!
The other question of interest is:  Has anyone had any experience with
the graphics capability of the Laser Jet??  It appears straightforward
to use graphics to generate special symbols imbedded in text, but given
the limited (59K) memory it does not seem possible to draw line graphs, etc.
Of course, bit mapped graphics 8" X 10" X 300 dots X 300 dots/in is
880Kbytes!!

Thanks,

Article-I.D.: decvax.524
Received: from Usenet.uucp by SRI-Unix.uucp with rs232; 29 Apr 83 1:34-PDT

I have received a large number of requests from people who have not received
parts of the last XLISP distribution.  For a while I was honoring requests
to send individuals the files that they were missing.  Then, when that became
unreasonable due to the number of requests, I reposted several of the
original files.  Even then I got requests from people who hadn't gotten either
the original version or the redistributed version.  Because of all of this I
have decided that net.sources isn't a reliable way of distributing a program
as large as XLISP.  Rather than replying to each of the people who sent me
mail, I am sending this news article to explain my next plan for distributing
XLISP.  Would anyone who wants a copy of XLISP please send me a stamped,
self addressed SSSD floppy at the following address:

	David Betz
	Digital Equipment Corporation
	110 Spit Brook Rd.
	Nashua, NH  03062

Please specify whether you want the disk in CP/M format, RT-11 format,
VMS format, or UNIX (tar) format.

I'm sorry about this being a less than convienient form of distribution,
but I don't think that its fair to the rest of the users of the network
to continue sending the large XLISP distribution files over and over
again just so that the few people who didn't receive them correctly the
first time can have another chance.

Subject: ZCPR3 Bug Fixes

	FYI, pass one is now complete on the bug fixes.  All bugs
reported in the ZCPR3 newsletters have been addressed and (so the test
group feels at this time) corrected.  We are planning to go thru a lot
of really extensive testing before the release of the "bug disk", and
I am sending this message to let you know that things are happening in
this area.

	The bugs reported in the ZCPR3 tools have shown themselves in
the variety of different installations that people have made of ZCPR3.
I feel that this should be emphasized -- many of the bugs may never be
observed by many of you because of the nature of your installation.
The newsletters should serve to make you aware that you MAY see these
bugs, and you should be aware of the potential of encountering them.

	One non-bug which I will work on soon is a revision of ZEX.
The new ZEX will be able to be installed like any other tool, and the
involved reassembly process will be eliminated.  ZEX is so powerful
and fundamental to ZCPR3 that I feel that any stumbling block placed
in the way of its use, such as its involved installation with a
CERTAIN, SPECIFIC version of ZSID, should be removed.

Second and last request for a calendar/scheduling program...

A week ago I asked INFO-CPM list for information regarding the above.
Again I plea for information that might be out there in netland regarding
such a program either in the public domain or commercially available.  I
got one reply indicating DATEBOOK as a possible solution.  Are there others?
The other replies were from folks such as I asking for me to share the info I
get on the subject.  There is interest from many quarters - PLEASE respond if
you have ANY info on ANY calendar/scheduling software at all.  Thanks in 
advance for anything you can share with us.

Are  there  any recommendations for a line-oriented editor for an
8086-based micro running MS-DOS?  This is for people who can  use
a  braille terminal with an 8086 machine (by declaring the device
as AUX).  The line-oriented editor should have no screen-oriented
characteristics  or  graphics in it.  EDLIN will work with such a
configuration, but is very buggy.  If you  know  of  any  editors
that  perform  like  EDLIN but with much greater capabilities and
are not buggy, let me know.  I ned the name of  the  editor,  the
vendor  and  his  address,  and  the  approximate  price  of  the
software.

As  an  example  of  a  screen-oriented  program,  BASIC  is  NOT
accessible  by braille terminals in AUX mode.  (BASIC in MS-DOS).
Another way to determine if the editor will  function  without  a
screen  is to use CTTY /DEV/PRN or <CONTROL-P> and see if you can
access the editor with all output going to the printer instead of
tothe screen.  EDLIN works this way also, but BASIC won't.

Thanks in advance for any info.

with Anchor XII.  As you can see I am now on the Multics machine.  Does
any one know of Modem7 running here or must I use kermit.  Also there is
some conversion program for FTP files that we can get.  Apparently , I
heard only the source for Modem740 is on the

it expected.?  Thanks,

From the A>SUBMIT $$$.SUB should envoke the file. CP/M86 is different
than CP/M80 in this respect. This problem exists with dBASEII, the
command "QUIT TO" creates a  .SUB file of commands which are exicuted
upon exiting dBASEII in CP/M80 but won't work in CP/M86 (1.107).

Hi, Dave,

	I haven't made any changes to ZCPR3 itself yet.  The changes just apply
to the toolset.  There are no plans to change the distributed installation
manual since it and the newsletters combine to document the installation
procedures and the anticipated problems associated with installation.
The book has a large section on installation, and I'm trying to make sure
that it is up to date.

Isaac,

1. As per the norm, I haven't observed the problem with ? that
you mentioned.  I just read your note, returned to my system, entered
DU3, typed ?, and read thru the help screens.  I also did the same thing
from the command line: DU3 ?.

I don't doubt that the problem exists as you say it does.  Probably
a subtle difference between our systems.  Also, I'm not surprised that
the problem was fixed in DU2 and it never got back to me.  Under the old
system (without Echelon around to be a point for CM control), that happened
a lot.  People would make changes and I would never see them, and, even if I
did, rather than getting a DIFF file which would point exactly to the changes,
I would get a new source and be expected to go thru it to figure out what they
did (of course, it is still THIS way).  Quite a time loss.  Do you want to
track the problem and point it out to me?  This may be best since I am
not able to duplicate it.

2. Your arrow keys problem is typical.  That's why the old Wordstar sequence
is still in there as well.  Rather than reassembling to give you a different
exit char, you could also zero the arrow key definitions for the 820-II
and use the WS keys instead.  Then there would be no conflict.  Either way.

Try the editor in the "Software Tools" book by Ritchie and Plaugher.
There is both Pascal and Ratfor versions and the program is pretty
straight forward and well documented. You could even modify/custimize
it to fit your needs. If programming is not your cup of tea, then 
you may be able to find it commercially (Software Toolworks ???).

I receive a letter in the mail today from TRIOS Micro Systems
indicating that they are discontinuing sale and delivery of the PMC
Micromate Model 101.  In place of the PMC Micromate they are now
selling a new product called the "Micromix 3.0" which is also a Z80A
machine, but with addtional features and options.  The bundled software
appears to be the same (CP/M Plus, T/Maker III, etc.). Hardware is
packaged better (one or two drives in the CPU box). 128K banked RAM is
standard (same as PMC Model 101), 256 banked RAM is optional (new).
Diskette controller is the Western Digital FD 1793 (supports 4 8" and 4
5.25" external drives, and optional 2 3.5" drives). Also new are:
optional 4K, 8K, or 16K on-board EPROM,  2 DMA controllers, and
optional SIO controller for synchronous comms. CPU box is 50% wider
(aprox. 9x9x14"). Price for the low end unit (CPU / single 5.25 drive)
is the same.

Delivery of the MicroMix 3.0 will start in 30-45 days.

TRIOS customers with outstanding orders for the old MicroMate product
may either request that TRIOS reschedule on a first in - first out basiss
and receive delivery of the new updated product (Micromix 3.0), at no
addtional cost, or they may reissue their purchase order for the
older product directly to Personal Micro Computers, Inc., the
manufacturer, on the manufacturer's terms for price and delivery.

I have looked into modems and like the Rixon 212, it is microprocessor
run, Hayes compatible, stores up to 10 phone numbers with discriptive
text (batt. backup) and can link phone numbers (if one is busy, another
number is automaticly dialed). Price about $500 but I've seen it for
less than $400.

	That is interesting news.  It is the nature of the computer business
that you always have to have an upgrade or a new product.  At least it is
close enough that Micromate isn't abandoned.  I will try to get to user's
meeting tonight.  My system is working great.

	I got my huge tri-band Yagi beam up on the house last Sunday--
with some neighbors acting a little upset about the view.  Must think
of some peace offerings. Hi Hi

The Sysop is the main maintainer of the program now -- he
is working on a new version (he is already several versions
ahead of what you have if you haven't talked to him probably).

This is to announce KERMIT-80 for Compupro Interfacer 3/4 with CP/M-80 2.2,
based on version 3.9A of CP/M Kermit.  It includes support for:

. Interfacer 3/4 board I/O.
. Terminal control sequences for Wyse Technology WY-100.
. Racal-Vadic Auto Dial VA212 modem
. US Robotics Password modem
. Sending break with <ESC> B while CONNECTed.

The source is in KER:CPMPRO.M80.  The hex file is in KER:CPMPRO.HEX, and a
help/installation file is in KER:CPMPRO.HLP.  These files are available via
anonymous FTP from CU20B and COLUMBIA-20 (after 6pm Eastern time).

No attempt was made to build all the other CP/M Kermits from this source, so
for now it will have its own.  It is expected that Compupro IF 3/4 support will
be added to version 4 of CP/M-80 Kermit, the "modular version", soon after
version 4 is released.

Subject: Index to BYTE
To: info-cpm@Amsaa.ARPA
cc: STORK@Mit-Mc.ARPA, POURNE@Mit-Mc.ARPA

Many of us have been annoyed by the fact that BYTE seems to have
given up indexing its book.  There is a lot of good stuff there,
but finding it when you need it is godawful.

Assuming that BYTE is not about to do an index (are they, Jerry P.?),
here is an idea:
  How about a cooperative project in which as many of the netlandians
who want to participate JOINTLY put together a PD BYET index.
A group of us could be a teering committee to set up a system
(probably based on dBSEII) and then -- when the system exists as a
.CMD file for data entry -- people could volunteer to do
1 or 2 back issues, or maybe half an issue, or whetever (depends on
the number of volunteers).  If that works, and if enough
people are willing to help, we can have for our use something that
BYTE damned well should provide to its subscribers, but doesn't seem
to want to provide (why not, Jerry P.?).

If interested in participating in this project, please
contact me at STORK@MIT-MC.  If there is enough interest,
I'll put together a proposal for the people who are
interested.  Please indicate if you are willing to (1) help
plant the project, and/or (2), index an issue.
If volunteering for indexing, pls indicateyour collection or
access to back issues.

Eric - You have an excellent idea re: PD BYTE index.  If you get enough inter-
ist, I would like to participate.  Perhaps an INFO-BYTE area can be set up here
at MIT and we could all feed our input to a central file.  I suggest that if
enough interest is forthcoming, that all those interested be assigned a very
specific subject to keep track of and report back to the main data file.  In
this way, nearly every subject of import to the readership of this great pub-
lication would be covered.  I would keep an eye out for material on any subject
I am given - this would be no real chore since I read the magazine from cover
to cover anyhow (I am sure most folks do).  Keep me informed on the level of
interest you generate.  I will encourage others that I know on MC to get a word
back to you indicating their level of interest and suggestions for smoothing
the the input process.  Good luck on this venture...

Subject: MD730C64 modem program for Commodore 64 CP/M

Ross Alford <mcnc!ecsvax!alford> has contributed MD730C64, a version
of MDM730 for Commodore-64 CP/M.  He says:

MD730C64 is the version of MDM730 that runs on the C64.  It works well
for xmodem file transfers (much more reliable than MODEM64).
Unfortunately, it only runs at 300 baud, and the SET command sends it
off into a nasty disk-grinding crash.  It uses 40 columns and the
standard Commodore character set in terminal mode.  Overall, much
better than MODEM64 but still needs work.

The files are now available from SIMTEL20 as:

In-Reply-To: Article <>

The routine is "setjmp" and in conjunction with "longjmp"
provides the ability to "goto" anywhere in a program where
you have already been.  It is typically used for error
recovery or interrupt handling and, like the mundane
"goto," is probably not a part of good, structured
programming.

You certainly should not go out of your way to work it into
your programs.

In trying to compile LUX40 (same with all previous versions of LUX) I
get 21 warnings in the form of:

Q 0A05' CD         0000       +       CALL

with no fatal errors. However, LUX then attaches to the LBR file but none of
the commands work. May be my M80 as it is an old version (3.35). Anyone
familiar with LUX and able to offer suggestions, I will appreciate as I
need a new version of LUX for my RCPM.

Subject: BYTE INDEX
To: INFO-CPM@Amsaa.ARPA
cc: STORK@Mit-Mc.ARPA

I am encourage by the response to my suggestion on yesterday regarding
the possibility of a PD joint effort to create an index to BYTE.
Here are a few points from the responses:
1.  Several people said they'd be glad to help, but do not have dBASEII.
    QUESTION:  Is it reasonable to assume that most everyone on this net
    has access to MBAASIC, or to something like it?  If so, we could
    put together a data input file that runs on basic and that 
    outputs the product in a standard format that can be accepted into
    dBASEII (or some other standard system).  I think that would work.
    If there are people who would participate but hesitate because they do not
    have dBASEII, please let me know about you if you have BASIC of
    some sort.
2.   Indexing is a lot of work.  Are there ideas of what should be 
     covered?  'Everything' is easy to say, but hard to do and
     generates a lot of output (of couse, we'll be able to scan it
     electronically).  Ideas on what should have priority attention?
3.   I'm collecting the names/net-addresses of people who respond to me on this
     and am glad to serve temporarily as the 'committee sec'y'.  Will
    get back to respondents in a few days, when there has been enough
    time to get most volunteer responses.
4.  In the meantime, if someone wants to forward the idea to
    the other nets (MICRO,PC,what have you), please do so.  There is a lot of
    work to be done and we can use as many volunteers as are available.

    For efficiency sake, for the time being, ask volunteers to respond
    direct to me (STORK@MIT-MC), and I'll compile a list.

Eric.

I tried to send an earlier message about Xmodem97 but it didn't get

several Undefined errors. Has anyone else experienced such problems?
If needed I can record where the errors took place.

Buying the 192k memory upgrade is not worth the money because you can
now get the 256k upgrade for roughly the same amount of money. This is
better because with the 256k upgrade, you can bump the memory of the
Rainbow to 800+k just by adding chips (Finally!). If you buy the 192k
option, that's all the memory you can get (just 256k). If you ever need
to upgrade past 256k you will have to sell your 192k board and by the
256k board anyways. If you are concerned that the PC100A will not
support that board, DEC has a memory adaptor that will convert your
PC100A into a PC100B for about $99 bucks.

The Rainbow 100 has the ability to read IBM single sided diskettes!
Use the IBM single side 8 sector format.
With perseverance it also seems to write to this format.

Now you can add RSX's to CP/M 2.2.  The following files are now

...and for those who want the entire package and can FTP ITS-binary
files:
22RSX.LBR.1			COM	 23296  A4F8H

Here's a brief excerpt from the author's .DOC file:

     22RSX: a Resident System Extension facility for CP/M 2.x

22RSX  is  a  facility to allow the installation and  removal  of
Resident System Extensions.  Briefly, an extension is an addition
to BDOS that can monitor,  trap,  alter or process any BDOS  call 
made  from an applications program.  This came about after I  had 
worked  a bit with CP/M 3.0.  It's RSX facility impressed me with 
the fact that it made it relatively easy to 'patch' the operating 
system  to add things such as remote  consoles,  print  spoolers, 
etc.  Since I had some experience with CP/M, I decided to write a 
similar system for CP/M 2.2.
Note:  I  realize  that  there is an RSX manager written  by  Jim 
Lopushinsky for CP/M 2.2.  I have never used it,  but from what I 
have  seen and read,  it seems to require a fair amount  of  work 
with DDT, M80, etc. This system, on the other hand, takes care of 
all installation. All you have to do is write a module, insert it 
in the driver,  assemble, load and run! And your finished product 
will,  assuming  that it uses standard CP/M calls and procedures, 
run on any other CP/M system without modification.

This system, as distributed, consists of the following files:

   22RSX.ASM    -------> The module installation driver.
   REMOVE.OBJ   -------> The module removal program.
   22RSX.DOC    -------> Documentation.
   EXPTABS.22X  -------> A demonstration module.
   CONSOLE.22X  -------> Another demonstration module.
   CONSTAT.ASM  -------> The companion access program for CONSOLE.22X.

Eric - The December 1981 issue of BYTE contained a very well done index of the
magazine from September 1975 (the first issue) through December 1981.  I have
no idea whether any more recent index has been published.  If not, and if BYTE
has no plans for doing so in the near future, I would be pleased to participate
in the public effort you have proposed.  I have all issues of BYTE from the
first onward.  I request that readers who would like to see the index I
mentioned above not ask me for copies.  The thing is about a quarter of an inch
thick when copied on a single-side copier, and I just don't have the time to
make copies, not to mention the matter of copyright.

Hi!  I believe that the recent start-up of ARPA INFO-CPM list feeds to
fa.info-cpm is redundant with a cross-feeding of the same information
with net.micro.cpm.  Although the effor to feed INFO-CPM is appreciated,
I believe that it is not necessary at this time.  Please turn it back
off so that we can reduce net traffic a bit.  Thanks.

    It is true that the Rainbow's drives can be configured in software to read
discs of a variety of formats, including IBM's 8 sector-per-track format,
which they seem to read quite reliably (once correctly set).

    ** HOWEVER .... **

    I *STRONGLY* suggest *NOT* writing to IBM PC formatted discs with 
the Rainbow 100 or the Rainbow 100+.  Our group regularly uses both machines, 
and we need to move text files between them.  We soon found that letting the 
Rainbow write to IBM discs results in areas on the disc which are unreadable 
to the IBM ("bad blocks" under the UCSD p-System).  Massive writes, such as 
moving files around on the disc, "seduce" the disc: the IBM will never read it 
again (except to format it): only the Rainbow will be able to use it.

    I know of two possible reasons for this:

    - number of tracks per inch: the IBM uses 48 TPI, the Rainbow 96 TPI
       (lets them get 800 UCSD blocks on one side of the disc).  The tracks
       that the Rainbow writes are too thin for the IBM.
    - number of parameters that software can set vs. all the parameters 
      that the drives actually use:  I do not believe that enough parameters
        are provided to let the software give an accurate description of the
	drive to be simulated.  One can, for instance, get close enough to the
	IBM's format to permit (reasonably) reliable reading; but not reliable
	writing.

    I am no expert in disc drive technology, so I may be quite wrong about both of these.  I would be interested to hear from people who know better.

PS.  Users of the p-System on the Sage, take note: SageUtil can be used to 
     configure the drives so that they write to Rainbow discs very reliably.
     I find this very useful when doing work for the Rainbow because of the 
     much greater speed of the Sage.
     Does that fact that the Sage drives are also 96 tracks per inch have
     anything to do with this?

Subject: NULU10 - a machine language alternative to LU

A machine language alternative to LU (the Library Utility program that
makes .LBR files) is now available from SIMTEL20.

Filename			Type	 Bytes	 CRC

Directory MICRO:<CPM.CPMLIB>
NULU10.COM.1			COM	 14336  63C1H
NULU10.DOC.1			ASCII	 40770  91E0H
NULU10.HEX.1			ASCII	 34899  255BH

...and the whole package for those who can FTP ITS-binary files:
NULU10.LBR.1			COM	 38272  D7CEH

Here is an excerpt from the author's .DOC file:

NULU  is  offered  as a complete replacement for LU  and  LSWEEP.  
Weighing  in  at 14k,  it includes nearly all  features  of  both 
programs and then some.  It features:

	Two operation modes with a full menu for each
	Viewing  and printing of member files,  unsqueezing  when
                necessary
	Extraction of member files with an option to unsqueeze
                where appropriate
	Bigger libraries, up to 800 members or more depending on
                available memory
	Automatic member sorting, all members kept sorted at all
                times
	Faster reorganization
	Enhanced error handling
	Access to deleted members
	Optional read only mode
	General compatibility with LU and NSWEEP syntax
	Numerous user patches

I  am aware of only one thing that LU does that NULU does not do.  
LU  maintains  a  CRC for each member file and  for  the  library 
directory  as a whole.   NULU doesn't do this at all.   In  fact, 
NULU changes these CRC bytes to 00 as soon as it gets the chance.  
In case you still want or need to run LU on a library modified by 
NULU, LU will simply regard it as a library created by an earlier  
LU version and will promptly set CRC's for the various members.

To the best of my knowledge,  NULU will run on any system running 
CP/M  2.x  or  higher,  however it has only been  tested  on  the 
Osborne  1  and the Osborne Executive computers.   It is  written 
entirely in 8080 assembly language.

Subject:  GSX-80

Does anyone out there know what is happening with Digital Research's GSX-80,
their graphics system extension?

I have an S-100 system running CP/M Plus and would like to add bit-mapped
graphics capability and develop some window-based software. GSX-80 sounds
like a reasonable software base but I have been unable to get any info
about it from DR. Is GSX-80 still alive ? (Is DR still alive?). Do any of
the graphics hardware vendors support it? 

I am hoping to use CP/M Plus memory banking to build a single-user,
multi-tasking extension based on a window manager. Other than the window
system itself, the biggest problem seems to be file handling. Does anyone
know of any fundamental problems in using CP/M 3.0 this way. Does D.R.
have any intentions to introduce additional CP/M-80 products? 

Thanks for any advice you can give.

I need to make notes about the articles I review, each note focusing on
a different aspect of the article's quality, then keep track of the

The table comparing baudot and ascii codes is quite handy if you are doing
an interface between the two systems.  However, there is an error in the
table.  The "decimal" column should start with zero and end with 127.  As
posted, it starts with 1 and ends with 128.

As you know 8086 and 8080/Z80 are different microprocessors
with different instruction sets. Therefore the programs (.COM files)
from CP/M 80 will not execute on the 8086. If the programs are
written in a high level language and you have the sources and the
language's CP/M 86 counterpart exist, then you could
recompile/reinterpret the sources to execute the programs on CP/M 86. 

Data files, however, are compatible enough that you should not need
to modify them.

No, but I did notice that an earlier version of NSWP207 that I got from a
CBBS that had a banner date 7/14/84 had a completely different BINCOM.
I don't know which is correct.  I never noticed any problems with the
earlier version.

The first time I got Nsweep207, I did have problems with it trashing
files on me. I later got a different copy (from SIMTEL) and it seems
to be working fine. The only little thing I have noticed is that it
will not generate a squeezed file for files smaller than 2k on my
hard disk system, and on a floppy system. I assume it is looking to
see if the squeezed file will be larger than the source and skipping
it if so.

	I am very interested in conferencing software, mail

	I do not know what languages these are written in, who
owns them (or are they public) etc.  Preferably we would like
something we can get source code for taht will handle or can be
modified to handle a lot of users.  We are prepared to rewrite,

In the following list of changes/additions to the subject directory, the
old sub-directory (9-14-84) appears first and the new sub-directory
(10-06-84) immediately thereafter.

Thus, the sub-directory micro:<cpm.apple> is unchanged except that the file
appledrv.doc.1 has been added.  Where the sub-directory name appears only
once (at the left margin), that is an entirely new sub-directory.  For
example, see micro:<cpm.cobol>.

Subject: XMODEM64 for Commodore-64 - author reply

Just after my announcement of the availability of XMODEM64.BAS for the
Commodore-64, the following message was received.  A reply from the
author follows:

Date: Thursday, 30 August 1984
From: prindle at NADC
To:   Info-Cpm
Re:   Christensen MODEM program for Commodore-64

Unfortunately, Commodore BASIC programs, of which this one is no
exception, utilize control characters, both normal ascii ones and ones
with the high order bit set (ie. chr$(x) where x>127), and are thus
not amenable to storage and transfer as normal ascii files.  All of
the cursor positioning characters and reverse field characters are
missing from MICRO:<CPM.COMMODORE>XMODEM64.BAS.  Commodore BASIC
programs must be treated (especially by XMODEM programs themselves) as
"binary", not text, and are best transmitted as hex files.  Of course,
it is possible to write a C64 program which uses only the normal ascii
subset, but I haven't seen one (nontrivial) yet!

[The author reply via TCBBS Detroit]

Msg 282 is 15 line(s) on 09/18/84 from JOHN s hex files.  Of course,
it is possible to write a C64 program which uses only the normal ascii

[The author reply via TCBBS Detroit]

Msg 282 is 15 line(s) on 09/18/84 from JOHN DAVIS
to PRINDLE AT NADC about XMODEM64.BUG

Sir:
I read the file you uploaded titled XMODEM64.BUG
It is in total error! Please have it deleated!
Before I uploaded the program XMODEM64.BAS I checked
to be sure there were NONE of the special Commodore
characters you talk about. They were all expressed as
CHR$(123) or whatever.  Ie. J$=CHR$(13) (return)
This program was written just so it could be uploaded
in this manner as was most of the program that uploaded it
no special reverse vidio characters appear anywhere in the
listing of this program no are any intended to.
Also the program was uploaded with XMODEM checksum protocall
That means that any 8 bit characters would have made the 
trip with no problems as XMODEM is an eight bit format
Please check your comments closer in the futher thanks

Subject: Demise of MICROSYSTEMS magazine

Just about a year after Ziff-Davis took over the publication of
Microsystems, they decided to drop the magazine last month due to
"poor" circulation and lack of substantial growth potential.  Current
circulation is about 55,000, and 100,000 is the minimum they estimate
they need to make it viable.  The November issue, to be shipped
shortly, will be its last.

I talked to Sol Libes last night and he gave me that information
above.  Needless to say, Sol was quite depressed about this whole
situation, and says he has been for the last month since the decision
was made.  He also said that he had unsuccessfully tried to buy
Microsystems from Ziff-Davis.  He is trying to find another publishing
service to start up a new magazine to continue the recent trend of
articles in the old one with himself and Chris Terry doing the
editorial work.

In my opinion, Microsystem was one of the finest publications
available for the serious programmer.  It will be missed by many of
us.

It's no wonder that Microsystems is dead, it has been going down hill
ever since Ziff-Davis took over. The emphasis has shifted from S-100 and
CP/M to IBM-PC and UNIX. I for one an tired of hearing about the PC and
all its clones. Whatever pub. that Sol wants to start, I'll subscribe to
it.

Status of This Memo

   This RFC suggests a proposed protocol for the ARPA-Internet 
   community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements. 
   Distribution of this memo is unlimited.

   This paper proposes and specifies a protocol which allows two 
   programs to reliably communicate over a communication link.  It 
   ensures that the data entering one end of the link if received 
   arrives at the other end intact and unaltered.  The protocol, named 
   RATP, is designed to operate over a full duplex point-to-point 
   connection.  It contains some features which tailor it to the RS-232 
   links now in common use.

Public access files may be copied from the <RFC> directory at 
SRI-NIC.ARPA via FTP with username ANONYMOUS and password GUEST.

   The normal method for distribution of RFCs is for interested parties 
   to copy the documents from the NIC online library using FTP.  
   Requests for special distribution should be addressed to either the 
   author of the RFC in question or to NIC@SRI-NIC.ARPA.  Unless 
   specifically noted otherwise on the RFC itself, all RFCs are for 
   unlimited distribution.

Submissions for Requests for Comments should be sent to 
POSTEL@USC-ISIF.ARPA.

Requests to be added to or deleted from this distribution list should be
sent to NIC@SRI-NIC.ARPA.

Text: Excuse the media, only have access to this net.  Query for hardware
information...

   I obtained a surplus keyboard a while back that has the most fantastic
feel and layout of any that I have experienced to date.  In attempting to
use it in a new construction project, however, I discoverd that it uses
Hall-Effect switches.  Being stationed in Germany, I have been unable to
locate any information on how to build an encoder, or even the theory of
operation for these little beasts.

   Any information on these switches would be appreciated, to include
addresses of OEMs.  The particular unit in question was manufactured by
Microswitch, but the letter I mailed five months ago (which included a
SASE) was never answered.  The mail over here is slow, but I must conclude
that they will not respond.

   I would appreciate any info, to include deep "tech talk".  Have been
homebrewing computers for over 8 years.

   Thanks in advance.

Subject:  Re:  Help with Hall-Effect

Hal - I have disassembled a couple Hall-effect keyswitches, and have found
inside each an integrated circuit chip mounted with its plane vertical.  Four
connections protrude from the bottom of each chip assembly.  These connections
allow each chip assembly to be soldered to a mother-board which underlies the
keyswitch matrix.  The mechanical portion of each keyswitch consists of a
magnet mounted on a plunger, and a restoring-spring.  When the plunger is
depressed, the magnet is moved down next to the IC chip assembly, thereby
subjecting the chip to a magnetic field.  In the case of the switches I have
disassembled, the magnet assembly is U-shaped, and actually surrounds the chip
when the plunger is depressed.  The presence of a magnetic field causes the
chip to establish an electrical connection.  The following is excerpted from
a Micro Switch "product sheet", and gives a bit more description.

     "The 12SW and 16SW Series use the revolutionary Hall effect solid state
switch pioneered and developed by MICRO SWITCH.  Solid state switches eliminate
the problems associated with mechanical switching...contact bounce, contamin-
ation, and intermittent switching at low levels.

     The switching function is performed within an integrated circuit 0.040
inch square.  The chip is actuated by a magnet to produce an analog control
voltage.  Hall voltage is converted into a digital output with a trigger
circuit and amplifier.  Each key module provides two isolated outputs."

     This little blurb is for numeric keypad assemblies 12SW and 16SW, having
12 and 16 switches respectively.  They operate from a +5-volt supply, and draw
60 and 80 MA max respectively, inplying a drain of 5 MA per keyswitch.  Each
output (there are two per keyswitch) puts out a minimum of +2.4 volts while
sourcing 160 microamps with the switch DE-ACTIVATED.  In the ACTIVATED state,
each output can sink 3.2 MA with a maximum voltage drop of +0.4 volts.  This
is obviously intended to interface with TTL circuits.

     I have "product sheets" for the following Micro Switch keyboards:
	53SW1-1
	61SW12-1
	50SW11-50
	67SW5-17
	66SW6-51
	66SW6-52
	78SW6-44
	63SW5-4
	70SW12-1
	75SW12 series
	51SD12-1
	51SW12-1
If any of these numbers match your keyboard, let me know and I'll give you
whatever additional information I have.  Don't expect much, however, as
there is little technical data in these "product sheets".


Best regards,

Dave

Hello Keith --

     Keith, after <CPM.22RSX>REMOVE.COM did nasty things to my test
disk, I disassembled it and found a couple of interesting things.

Woe to those with systems that have:

    (a) other than an LXI H,WMADDR / SHLD 0006 in the warmboot routine
	for initializing locations 5 and 6.  Both 22RSX and REMOVE look
	for the LXI H,d16 / SHLD 06 sequence.

    (b) the BIOS WMBOOT routine in ROM - the RSX installation will
	work okay until the next JMP 0 when locations 5, 6, and 7
	are re-loaded from the BIOS WMBOOT routine.

    (c) Lastly, the routine that searches for LXI H,d16 / SHLD 06
	( hex 21 xx xx 22 06 ) doesn't check for the 00 after the 06.
	The demo software blew up on me as (I found out later) there
	is an LXI H,d16 / SHLD 06F3 in my system before the warmboot
	vector gets initialized and the software got 'confused'
	and modified the wrong data.

	The *REAL* gotcha is that both programs search for the
	LXI / SHLD sequence starting at **04, "**" being system size
	dependent.

Whew... enough bug tracing for this week...

***********************   BUG ALERT !!! ************************

	this bug has not shown itself in version 1.11
*********************************************************

*			(up the creek without a paddle)	*
*********************************************************

Should this message make it to Ron Fowler, suggestion for MEX 2.0 or sooner:

	Allow toggle to silence messages like '***REPLY***','ZZZZZ',
'Term-mode' and other stat responses when executing from a READ file.
This way, one would see exactly what is happening on-line just as if
one is executing all commands invisibly (no harsh interrupting messages).
These messages take up valuable screen space.

	MEX is really evolving ... can't wait for version 2

Here is a short description of how it works:

WELCOME3.MEX, by Bruce Morgen, expert refinements by Ron Fowler, loop
back to auto-answer by Bruce Morgen.

This file may be used to do a relatively automatic file transfer setup
from your computer to a remote user.  It will prompt him to prepare a
file-receive at his end, wait for him to do it and allow a comment
(logged to a disk file) at the end.  PLEASE NOTE!:  THE FILE WILL WORK
AS-IS ONLY IF YOUR MEX OVERLAY SUPPORTS AUTO-ANSWER WITH A `SET
ANSWER' COMMAND.  It is only one small step toward really using MEX
1.11's programability and can be easily edited for other uses.

WELCOME4.MEX (9/19/84) is the result of a little on-line experience
and my extremely ethical nature, which would not allow me to promise
an XMODEM filesend that I could not deliver.........Bruce

Re:   Obscure microprocessor chip needed

This is quite a bit off the beaten track, but I thought I'd give it a
try.  If there are any UUCP lists which might address the issue (a
net.electronics, maybe?  or maybe even net.general?  I can't reach
UUCPland from here) I'd appreciate someone forwarding this there
(once, please).

I am in need of a rather obscure microprocessor/IO controller for an
Aiwa M800 cassette deck.  The processor controls the autobias adjust
for the deck.  Mine apparently crapped out, and Aiwa says they
discontinued the tape deck in April---hence they won't sell me a new
microprocessor.

I'd be willing to pay some reasonable amount for the right part, or
even for a similar deck that for some other reason doesn't work and is
about to be scrapped.  I'd aldo be more than willing to shower heaps
of thanks and praise for anyone who can direct me to a place I can get
this part.

Okay, 'nuff of that.  The part itself is specified as Aiwa part number
82-155-616-01, a "uCOM43-546C155".  It's got 42 (yep, 42) pins on it.

It's quite probable that this thing is an I/O controller with a
mask-programmed ROM in it.  This makes a close substitute, of course,
very much at issue.

If anyone knows how to find such an obscure part, or (heaven forbid)
has an old deck they don't want for some reason which has a working
one, I'd be very grateful indeed.

To reply to me, send to FONER at MIT-MC if you're on the ARPAnet.
UUCP users who can't hit the ARPAnet can reply directly if they know
some working route to mitccc or mit-charon.  (My username is simply

    Re:   BYTE Index

    Is it true that BYTE is planning to publish an index soon?
    If so, the PD effort I suggested to create a BYTE index is
    a waste of time.  Will appreciate your advice.

Subject: MEX overlay for Apple II with Micromodem II/IIE

A new overlay is now available for the MEX modem program for use with
the Apple II with the Hayes Micromodem II/IIE and the ALS CP/M card or
the Microsoft CP/M card.  This version supports Touch-Tone dialing on
the Micromodem IIE.  Also, a bug was fixed that prohibited the
Micromodem IIe from operating on the Softcard.

The file is available from Simtel20 as:

From: Dan Kent  <KENT@SUMEX-AIM.ARPA>
Subject: anotated biblio software?

Can anyone reveal their experience with bibliography management software?
Have been using raw DbaseII on my Osbornes with CPM 2.2 and hating it.

I need to make notes about the articles I review, each note focusing on
a different aspect of the article's quality, then keep track of the 
citation by author and thre or four keywords, and by my adhoc rating of
article qualtiy...

If anyone can help, I will summarize for the net.  Id appreciate hearing
about PD as well as proprietary software, even MSDOS stuff...

Yes, there is a PD Bibliography package.  It's now available from
Simtel20 as:

Filename			Type	 Bytes	 CRC

Directory MICRO:<CPM.BASIC>
BIBLIO.LBR.1			COM	 35584  601BH

Please take a look at it and send your comments and review to
Info-Cpm.  Thanks.
