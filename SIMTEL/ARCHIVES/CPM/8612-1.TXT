Subject: re: vi-like editor

Dr. Bruce Wampler's TVX editor (public domain) exists on SIMTEL20 in two forms:
in PD:<CPM.C128>C128TVX2.LBR is an older version that is "vi-like" but does
not have the same exact user interface as "vi", however, it is small enough to
run on a CP/M 3.0 system (mine has 58K TPA).  On PD:<MSDOS.TVX-EDITOR> is a
newer version with an interface which comes closer to emulating "vi", but may
be too large to run on a 64K system once compiled (I'm not sure, never tried).
There are conditional compilation sections to support CP/M.  The source lang-
uage is "C".  The .COM file in C128TVX2.LBR is set up for an ADM31 terminal
emulation - if you have any other terminal type, you will have to re-compile.

Subject:  CP/M 80 C

	Thanks to all for responses to my query.

	I thought I'd pass on the results of phone conversations with two
CP/M 80 C compiler vendors.

1)	the latest release of Aztec C is 1.06d.  According to the vendor,
	it is System V compatible with respect to all the pre-processor
	directives (I didn't ask whether they had bit-fields yet).

	(The pre-processor stuff is important if you like Fred Fish's 
	DBUG program posted on the network a little while ago.)

2)	the latest release of the Eco-C compiler is 3.47.  They too men-
	tioned support for System V pre-processor directives.  The person
	I talked to would not guarentee that a "bug" I was told was in
	their CP/M 80 C compiler had been fixed.  (He says that K&R say
	that there is supposed to be a space between the function name and
	the left paran.)
	(or at least that there is some scripture somewhere which justifies
	their not making a change)

	Thanks again for your replies.  We still have not made any commit-
ments so any additional information will be appreciated.

Hello.

	I successfully uploaded the DRACO system and example programs from
SIMTEL20, and have had 100% success in getting the demo programs to compile
and run.

	However, for some reason, whenever I try out any program which has
any errors in - for example:

#util.g

proc nonrec main() void:

if x=1 then
	writeln("Hi there.")
fi
corp

	...then although the correct error (16) is flagged showing that "x" is
unknown, the full error message does not appear, even though DRCERR.DAT is
on the same (default) directory.

	I am using DRACO.COM rather than BIGDRACO.COM, 'cos my CP/M-plus system
only has a 59K TPA, and BIGDRACO.COM needs 60K (apparently).


	Does anyone have any suggestions as to what I am doing wrong?

A few weeks ago, I was able to access simtel20. I received the INFO
package and then received some catalogues.  I have asked simtel for
some more catalogues and have received no reply.


I received the following information. It is excerpted from an article
on netnews:

What I would like to know is, did I originally access simtel20 legally,
and if so, can I still access it ? I communicate to simtel through ihnp4. Does
this satisfy the above requirements?

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Subject: UNIX equivalent for crunch 2.3

I am looking for a high level language (read that "C") implementation which
uncompresses files compressed by the CP/M utility CRUNCH 2.3.  I've always
been impressed by the many, many, implementations of SQ/USQ, all of which
read and write the same format files.  Unfortunately, this is apparently not
the case with this new generation of "Lempel-Zev" compression programs.
Neither "COMPRESS" (from PD:<UNIX.FILE-MGMT>), nor "LZW" (from PD:<UNIX.CPM>),
will decode this format; add to this the fact that "LZW" seems to be terminally
broken when compiled under UNIX.  A solution to this problem is not obvious.

Alternatively, I would take a formal specification of the format of these
"crunched" files and put together such a utility myself.

Thanks in advance,

Subject: CRUNCH-UNCRUNCH abstract

The following is Steven Greenberg's ABSTRACT.TEC from CRUNCH23.LBR.

                       Technical Abstract

CRUNCH 1.x maintained a table representing up to 4096 strings  of
varying lengths using the so called LZW algorithm, which has been
described in the earlier documentation.  These strings were  ent-
ered into a table in a manner where the strings content was  used
to  determine the physical location (hashing), and that  location
was used as the output code.  Hash "collisions" were resolved  by
maintaining another 12 bits of data per entry which was a "link",
or pointer to another entry.

In contrast, CRUNCH 2.x uses an "open-addressing, double hashing"
method similar to that employed in the UNIX COMPRESS.  This meth-
od  involves a table of length 5003, where only 4096 entries  are
ever made, insuring the table never gets much more than about 80%
full.  When a hash collision occurs, a secondary hash function is
used to check a series of additional entries until an empty entry
is  encountered.   This method creates a table filled  with  many
criss-crossed "virtual" chains, without the use of a "link" entry
in the table.

One reason this is important is that [without using any addition-
al  memory] the 1 1/2 bytes which were previously allocated as  a
link can now become the [output] code number.  This enables us to
assign  code  numbers, which are kept right alongside  the  entry
itself,  independently  of the entry's physical  location.   This
allows  the codes to be assigned in order, permitting the use  of
9-bit  representations  until there are 512 codes in  the  table,
after which 10 bit representations are output, etc.

The  variable bit length method has three ramifications.   It  is
particularly  helpful when encoding very short files,  where  the
table  never even fills up.  It also provides a fixed  additional
savings  (not  insubstantial) even when the table does  fill  up.
Thirdly,  it  reduces the overhead associated with  an  "adaptive
reset"  to the point where it becomes a very viable  alternative.
"Adaptive  reset" simply means throwing out the whole  table  and
starting over.  This can be quite advantageous when used  proper-
ly.  CRUNCH v2.x employs this provision, which was not  incorpor-
ated in the V1.x algorithm.

"Code  reassignment" is an advancement I introduced with the  re-
lease  of CRUNCH v2.0 based on original work.  It is not used  in
COMPRESS,  any  MS-DOS ARC program, or [to the best of  my  know-
ledge]  any other data compression utility  currently  available.
There are many ways one might go about this (and at least as many
possible pitfalls).  The algorithm I selected seemed to represent
a good tradeoff between speed, memory used, and improved  perfor-
mance, while maintaining "soundness of algorithm" (ie it works).


Briefly,  it works as follows: Once the table fills up, the  code
reassignment process begins. (At this same time, the  possibility
of  adaptive reset is also enabled).  Whenever a new  code  would
otherwise be made (if the table weren't full), the entries  along
the  hash  chain  which  would normally  contain  the  entry  are
scanned.  The first, if any, of those entries which was made  but
never  subsequently referenced is bumped in favor of the new  en-
try.   The uncruncher, which would not normally need  to  perform
any  hash  type function, has an auxiliary  physical  to  logical
translation table, where it simulates the hashing going on in the
cruncher.   In this fashion it is able to exactly  reproduce  the
reassignments made my the cruncher, which is essential.

---

I  hope to write an article soon on "Recent Advancements in  Data
Compression".  It would cover the recent history generally, along
with a more detailed description of some of the algorithms, and a
series of additional ideas for future enhancement.

I've been getting files from the Archive-Server at SIMTEL20 since its
inauguration without any problems, but now seem to have hit on one....

During the last ten days or so, I have sent off several requests (via the
Bitnet-Arpanet gateway at WISCVM ) but have not had a single reply.

I understand that there is some congestion between Bitnet and Arpanet -
is this the reason? Other stuff from Arpanet appears to be getting through,
including my INFO-CPM mailings. Could anyone throw any light on what is
happening? Have other Bitnet requestors encountered this problem recently?

Sorry, I tried to mail this, but it got bounced.


If the UART which you are using is a Z80 SIO or DART, then the interrupts
are easy.  If you have something like and 8251, then things get a bit worse.

All of the following assumes that you have a Z80 device out there:

  The Z80 actually has 3 interrupt modes:
  Mode 0:
  A device toggles the INTR line, and the Z80 reads one byte off of the data
bus and executes it.  This instruction is usually a RST, since these are one-
byte CALLs (so they can be forced easily).  The RST instructions run you to
one of 8 locations in low memory (0000, 0008, 0010, 0018, 0020, 0028, 0030,
or 0038).  Actually, you can force any instruction onto the bus, but it doesn't
really make sense to do a INC or whatever when an interrupt happens.
 This is not the mode you would be using.

 Mode 1:
 A device toggles the INTR line, and the Z80 branches to location 0038.  It
pushes the current PC onto the stack, so that you can perform an RET and get
back to your program.  This mode is rarely used.

 Mode 2:
 Welcome to the real power of interrupts.  In this mode, the I register
contains the top 8 bits of an address.  When a device toggles the INTR line,
the Z80 acknowledges it, and then reads in one byte.  This is the bottom
8 bits of an address.

	((I reg) * 256) + (byte read in)

The Z80 goes to the calculated address, and grabs the word there.  This is
the address vector of the interrupt routine.  Perhaps an example would help.

Suppose you had the following code at location XX00 (any page boundary):



; channel B of the SIO

	dw	chbtx		; transmitter empty
	dw	chbstat		; external status change
	dw	chbrx		; receive char available
	dw	chbspec		; special receive condition

; channel A of the SIO

	dw	chatx		; transmitter empty
	dw	chastat		; external status change
	dw	charx		; receive char available
	dw	chaspec		; special receive condition



Then, if you perform the following code:



	ld	a,XX		; the page number of the interrupt table
	ld	i,a		; setup the interrupt register



Any interrupt vectors that are placed on the bus will access the above
table.  Still with me?

Now, you need to set the SIO up.  You might want to find a DART or SIO
manual for this code to make sense, but here goes.  I use the OTIR to
output a block of data to the same port.  You need to know the ports that
the SIO resides at.



	ld	hl,table	; the address of the table
	ld	b,tlen		; the length of the table
	ld	c,SIO_PORT	; the port address
	otir



with a table that looks like this:



table:
	db	0		; junk.  Make sure we are at register 0
	db	18h		; reset the SIO
	db	4		; switch to register 4
	db	44h		; X16 clock, 1 stop, no parity
	db	3		; switch to register 3
	db	0c1h		; rx 8 bits, rx enable
	db	5		; switch to register 5
	db	0eah		; dtr, tx 8 bits, tx enable, RTS
	db	1		; register 1 (interrupt enable)
; set Y to 1 if you want a transmitter interrupt, or to 0 if you want to
; poll.  0 is probably the way you want to go.  Note that the value given
; below disables interrupts for special receive conditions, and for status
; changes (modem signals), so that the entries into the interrupt table above
; need not have them.
	db	000110Y0b	; rx int on all chars
; if this is channel B of the SIO which you are initializing, add the following
	db	2		; switch to register 2
	db	0		; vector value
tlen	equ	$-table		; calculate the length of the table



If you are not initializing channel B with the above code, you need to send
a 2 and a 0 to channel B's control port also.

Well, that is the very basics.  Make sure your interrupt routines end with
the RETI instruction, instead of a RET.  If you have any questions, send
me some mail, or give me a call at (206) 882-5252.

     As  mentioned, the cruncher is based an Kent Williams'  imp-
lementation  of the Lempel / Zev algorithm.  For  further  infor-
mation on the algorithm itself, I refer you to his public  domain 
file  LZW2COM.LBR which contains a description of  the  technique 
and an actual implementation written in "C" source.

     In order to make a practical stand alone "cruncher" that was 
easy  to use, especially for those already familiar with  squeez-
ers, some header information had to be included in the  resulting 
"crunched" file (eg. the filename of the original file, etc.).  I 
have  defined  a header based on the time  tested  squeezed  file 
format, with some necessary changes and a few additions.  The ad-
ditions are mostly to insure that files crunched now will  always 
be un-crunchable with future versions of the uncruncher, no  mat-
ter what possible enhancements are made.  Those familiar with the 
MS-DOS  ARC.xxx program have probably seen this idea  in  action.  
More on this later.

     Another  slight problem with LZWCOM & LZWUNC had to do  with 
the  question of termination.  When the input file was  exhausted 
during  compression,  it was unlikely the output file  was  on  a 
sector  boundary.   No matter what the rest of the  final  output 
sector  was padded with ("1A"'s were used), the uncruncher  would 
try  to uncrunch those bytes (since all data is conceivably  val-
id).   This  resulted  in occasional  extra  sectors  of  garbage 
following an otherwise properly decoded file.  While this did not 
usually cause a problem, it was certainly not desirable.

     I have chosen to handle the termination problem the same way 
it was handled with squeezed files;  by dedicating a unique  code 
to  represent EOF (End Of Field).  By only allowing 4095  instead 
of  4096 different codes (not a major shortcoming), code 000  can 
become  a  dedicated EOF.  As soon as it is  encountered  on  the 
input  file, the decoding process is known to be  complete.   For 
those who are interested, the exact code put out by CRUNCH can be 
duplicated by the "C" program LZWCOM if table entry zero "artifi-
cially" flagged as "used" (before initializing the table).   That 
insures  that the code will never come up, except  when  manually 
inserted at the end of file.

     The other functional difference from LZWCOM involves  repeat 
byte coding.  CRUNCH converts the "physical input stream" into  a 
"logical  input  stream", which is then handed to  the  cruncher.  
The conversion takes 3 or more contiguous occurrences of the same 
byte  and encodes them as <byte> "90H" <count> where  "count"  is 
the number of "additional" occurrences of <byte> (ie total occur-
rences  -1).  90H itself is encoded as "90H" ,"00".  This  scheme 
is identical to that used in standard squeezing.

     Crunching  requires  only one pass through the  input  file, 
while  squeezing requires two.  While this is one of its  signif-
icant  advantages, it does complicate the problem of including  a 
checksum,  if  one is desired, in the header of the  result  file 
(since  the value is not known until everything is done).  A  bad 
solution is to close the finished output file, re-open it, insert 
the checksum, and close it again.  A good solution is to put  the 
checksum at the end of the output file right after the EOF.   And 
that's  where  it is.  With all this in mind,  herein  follows  a 
specification for the format of a crunched file.

          ---------------------------------------------

     ID  FIELD:  Bytes 0 and 1 are always 076H and 0FEH,  respec-
tively.  This identifies the file as "crunched".

     FILENAME:  The  filename field starts at byte 2.   It  is  a 
field  of variable length, terminated by a zero byte.  The  field 
contains  the  filename as ASCII chars, including  an  ASCII  "." 
immediately preceding the filename's extension.  Less than  eight 
characters may precede the ".";  there is no necessity to pad the 
filename with blanks.  Additional characters after the 3rd exten-
sion character but before the zero byte specifically are  allowed 
and  will be ignored by the current uncruncher.  This  allows  an 
area of unlimited size for date stamping, or other  miscellaneous 
information which a future cruncher or application program  might 
want  to insert, for use or display by some uncrunching  program.  
By  skipping over these bytes now, future  incompatibilities  are 
eliminated.

     Following the zero byte are the following 4 bytes, in order:

     REFERENCE REVISION LEVEL:   1 byte  }
     SIGNIFICANT REVISION LEVEL: 1 byte  } described later
     ERROR DETECTION TYPE:       1 byte  }
     SPARE:                      1 byte  }

     CRUNCHED  OUTPUT: After the SPARE byte, the actual  crunched 
output finally begins.  The crunched output is a series of 12-bit 
codes  in "natural" order.  (Every other 12-bit code starts on  a 
byte  boundary and includes the 4 ms bits of the next byte.   The 
"odd"  codes start in the middle of a byte and include the  whole 
following byte as the remaining 8 ls bits).  A 12-bit code of 000 
is  an EOF, as explained above.  If the EOF code itself  ends  in 
the middle of a byte, an additional 4 bits of zero are padded  on 
to get back on a byte boundary for the checksum. 

     CHECKSUM: The next two bytes are the 16-bit checksum,  least 
significant  byte first.  The checksum is the modulo 2^16 sum  of 
all  the bytes as input from the physical input stream, prior  to 
repeat  byte encoding (or, in the case of uncrunching, as  output 
to the physical output stream, after repeat byte decoding).

     REMAINDER  OF THE SECTOR: The remaining bytes in the  sector 
following  the checksum are irrelevant.  CRUNCH fills  them  with 
"1A"'s.

          ---------------------------------------------

     These are the four bytes not fully described above:

     "Reference  Revision Level":  The program/revision level  of 
the  program that performed the crunch operation.  This  byte  is 
put  in  for general reference only. The current  value  is  "10" 
(hex).

     "Significant Revision Level":  If the value of this byte  in 
a  crunched data file exceeds the value contained within the  un-
crunching  program, the message "File requires newer revision  of 
program" will be displayed.  If changes or enhancements are  ever 
made to CRUNCH which are significant enough to actually output an 
incompatible file, the information in this byte will allow a  new 
revision  of UNCR to be compatible with all existing data  files, 
old  or  new.  The error message gets displayed only  if  someone 
tries to uncrunch a new file with an old uncruncher which doesn't 
know about the "future" format yet. Current value is "10" (hex).

     "Error Detection Type": If this value is non-zero, the  cur-
rent  uncruncher will not examine the checksum or give  an  error 
associated  with  it.  This will permit a CRC type (or  no  error 
checking) value to be used if circumstances warrant it. The  cur-
rent  UNCR program is always checking for "illegal" codes,  which 
are  ones which have not been defined by previous codes.  If  any 
are  encountered,  the message "Invalid Crunched File"  is  disp-
layed. This inherent self-checking probably precludes the  neces-
sity of more advanced error checking.

     "Spare":  The SPARE byte is a spare byte.

Subject: Towards a UNIX equivalent for crunch 2.3

The original LZWCOM program referred to in Steven Greenberg's
description of his CRUNCH/UNCRUNCH program is available from
SIMTEL20 as:

Filename			Type	 Bytes	 CRC

Directory PD:<CPM.SQUSQ>
LZW.LBR.1			BINARY	 50816  0D23H

This LBR contains the following files:

 COMMLZW.C
 LZW.C
 LZW.DQC
 LZW.SUB
 LZWCOM.COM
 LZWUNC.C
 LZWUNC.COM

Please remember that Greenberg has pointed out some shortcomings and
problems with the original LZWCOM approach.  However, this should be a
good starting place for making a Unix C version of Greenberg's
enhanced cruncher.  The LZW.DOC file says that the C programs can be
compiled on Unix and should be reasonably portable.

Please keep me posted on your progress.  I need a C version myself for
use here on SIMTEL20 to maintain the crunched files.

  I think this is backwards.  I use ECO-C (version 3.10) and you can NOT place
a space between the function call and the open paren.  K&R does NOT say that
a space is valid, but they never say that it isn't.

Subject: CP/M ARC's renamed to ARKs

In response to a suggestion by Bob Freed <apollo!freed@EDDIE.MIT.EDU>
the author of the CP/M UNARC program, I have renamed *.ARC to *.ARK in
the SIMTEL20 CP/M program archives and on my RCP/M Royal Oak.  I will
also be doing the same on the GEnie CP/M RoundTable.

Bob suggested that there would be less confusion about whether
programs were for CP/M or MSDOS.  The file structure of ARCs and ARKs
is identical and Bob's UNARC program will automatically deal with
either filetype extension.

Bob is close to releasing his new CP/M ARC/ARK maker program NOAH (as
in NOAH's ARK).  Questions about UNARC and NOAH should be directed to
Bob at his new network address (welcome to the network Bob!).

I also have experienced a major problem getting ANYTHING from SIMTEL20
lately.  I had entered requests every other day for about two weeks and
received nothing.  On a hunch, I tried sending a hand-constructed request
file, bypassing my mail system (even though it had always worked before).
I received the archive file the next day.
     Has something strange happened to the BITNET/ARPA gateway regarding
mail from mailers, or perhaps has ARCHIVE-REQUEST support changed slightly
so that my (formerly acceptable) RFC822 headers are rejected?

Geroge/Frank,

     I have been tasked with providing a quick response to a query regarding
site licensing of software.  I haven't been following this too closely of late.
Would appreciate any off-the-top-of-your-head comments on current status.

     On my last look, most software vendors (despite enormous pressure from
business users) were well-contented with status quo and reluctant to offer site
licenses.  The few I read about seemed to be only token gestures
(astronomically priced).  Has anything changed?

1.  Any typical examples spring to mind (product, license cost, copy limit)?

2.  Does one license generally provide for multiple formats (e.g., NorthStar,
Apple, Z-100, Wyse PC, Z-248)?

3.  Are patches or upgrades included or even provided for?

     Any quick thoughts would be appreciated.  Thanks.

No question.  Barnes&Noble.  Fifth Avenue at around 18th Street (It's
been a while... best to check the phone book first and get the exact
address).  They pride themselves on being able to come up with
virtually any textbook, including out-of-print ones.  I still use them
as a last-resort source when other efforts to find a book have failed,
even though I haven't lived in New York for years.

    I am trying to find a copy of CPM86 or Concurrent DOS. I just
got a hold of an iSBC 12a board (8086 processor for the multibus)
and need to get an OS up and running. I guess it doesn't need to be
CP/M but I don't know of any other OS readily available.

I will *PAY* for it if I can find something.

Thanks in advance,
Jeff Konicek

P.S. Anybody ever get MSDOS running on a non-ibm 8086 machine
    (Specifically, the multibus with ram, disk control, serial
     I/O, and terminal (no graphics))

The FCC is considering reregulating the packet-switching networks like Telenet,
Tymnet, Compuserve, The Source and PC Pursuit.	This could result in additional
costs to the user.  This is excerpted from Infomat magazine which is available
for downloading.


 ====================================
 COMPUTER AND SOFTWARE NEWS -- PART 1
 ====================================

 ------------------------------------
 FREE LOCAL ACCESS TO PACKET
 SWITCHING NETWORKS MAY BE ELIMINATED
 ------------------------------------

 (BPS) -- The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) will vote on a proposal
to reregulate packet switching networks that, if approved, would eliminate
free local telephone access to those networks.

 "If this occurs, it might eventually double or triple the costs to those
using packet switching networks to access commercial on-line databases and
information services and triple or quadruple the costs to those using
Telenet's PC Pursuit," said Philip M. Walker, vice president and regulatory
counsel for Telenet Communications Corp.

 Predictably, the initiative to reregulate packet switching networks comes
primarily from the Bell Operating Companies (BOCs) and secondarily from AT&T.
These companies provide local telephone service to vast majority of telephone
customers throughout the U.S. and will benefit the most from FCC reregulation
of the packet switching networks.

 Under current FCC rules formulated in 1980 in the FCC's Second Computer
Inquiry, called Computer II, a distinction is made between "basic services"
and "enhanced services."

 "Basic services" are those that don't offer protocol conversion such as local
and long-distance voice telephone services.  "Enhanced services" are defined
in an open-ended fashion as computer-based services that are more than a
"basic service," in other words, services such as packet switching networks,
database and on-line type services, and remote computing services that offer
protocol conversion, according to Walker.

 Under the 1980 Computer II Inquiry, the FCC ruled that "basic services" would
continue to be regulated as they had always been.  However, the FCC also ruled
that "enhanced services" would be deregulated, which opened up the industry to
competition.  This resulted in numerous companies entering the packet
switching business, including BOCs, AT&T and at least a dozen others.  The
competition resulted in significant price reductions for packet switching
services.

 To prevent monopolization of the packet switching industry by the Big Boys
(the BOCs and AT&T), the FCC ruled that they had to keep separate accounting
figures for their "basic services" and for their "enhanced services," and that
they could not use revenues from their lucrative "basic services" to cross-
subsidize their "enhanced service" packet switching networks.

 The FCC also ruled that if the BOCs and AT&T used their "basic service"
telephone lines for packet switching services, then they must let their
competitors have access to those lines on the same basis, which would preserve
true competition in the industry.

 "Now, under the FCC's Computer Inquiry III, the FCC is asking, should we
redefine protocol conversion services as 'basic services' rather than enhanced
services?  Should we redefine all those companies as common carriers?  This
would, in effect, subject them not only to federal regulations but, even
worse, to state regulations," Walker said.

 The result would eliminate comparable interconnection requirements currently
imposed on BOCs and AT&T, allowing them to charge their packet switching
competitors local dial-in fees to access packet switching long-distance line
networks.

 It would also allow BOCs and AT&T to offer their own packet switching
services on a non-compensatory basis and, finally, allow them to cross-
subsidize those services with revenues from their much more lucrative voice
telephone service revenues.  In short, it would allow BOCs and AT&T to
monopolize the packet switching industry and probably drive out most
competitors.

 "In terms of cost impact," Walker said, "if we had to pay local access
charges, it would cost us about $3.60 an hour at the originating end, for
calls made by users to on-line databases and information services like
CompuServe and The Source.

 "And with PC Pursuit, for which we have out-dial modems, we would have to pay
not only 3.60 per hour access fees at the originating end but also $4.80 at
the terminating end, a total of about $8 or $9.  Obviously, to survive, we
would have to add those additional charges to our current fees and pass them
on to our consumers," Walker said.

 That would almost certainly spell the end of PC Pursuit, and it would likely
put out of business not only many independent packet switching networks but
also many on-line databases and information services.

 FCC approval of changes being considered in Computer III, Walker said, "would
really have a major impact on anyone using a packet switching service to
access online bulletin boards, databases, or information services aimed at the
residential user.  They are just going to get creamed if this happens."

 Walker said that is was not clear exactly when the FCC would vote on the
proposal, but that it would probably be the latter part of January or early
part of February, 1987.  "They are moving very fast on this," he said.

 "Low-Cost packet switching Service Threatened"

 by Alan R. Bechtold

 As described in our lead news story this issue, the FCC is now considering a
major change in the way packet switched phone services are defined.  This
change is likely to lead to the demise of many of these services, and to much
higher prices for the use of the few that will eventually remain in business.

 At the risk of over-simplification, I think I should first describe just what
a packet switched networking service is.  These are the services you use to
access online databases and commercial online services, such as CompuServe and
The Source, with just a local telephone call.  Once you call the local Telenet
or Tymnet number, for example, and a connection is made, you are then
connected with a computer that puts you in communication with the online
services with which you wish to communicate.

 This computer is handling a number of calls into the main system computer at
the same time.	It takes information you send and delivers it in "packets" to
the proper destination, picks up information from the online service computer
you called, and sends it, also in "packets," back to you.  All of this
communicating is done in these so-called "packets" because this allows the
network's computers to offer protocol conversion and handle several ongoing
communications sessions at the same time.

 FCC regulations allow AT&T and Bell Operating Companies (BOCs) to engage in
packet switching network operations, but they must also maintain completely
separate accounting of their voice and packet switching operations.  They must
also offer free local-calling access to their lines to any competitors engaged
in the packet switching service industry.

 The above regulations have allowed Telenet and Tymnet, among others, to
operate at a reasonable cost in a competitive atmosphere.  This is a case of
regulation of a business actually RESULTING in increased competition and lower
prices to consumers.

 As things stand now, you can call any local Telenet or Tymnet access number
and use these services to inexpensively access such online services as
CompuServe, The Source, Delphi, and countless others.  In addition, GTE's new
PC PURSUIT service now offers you access, through their Telenet packet
switching service, to literally hundreds of local bulletin boards in cities
all across the country--for a flat charge of $25 per month.

 But, the FCC is now being asked to REREGULATE this segment of the
communications industry, eliminating the FCC requirements that AT&T and BOCs
keep separate accounting records of their voice and packet switching services,
and eliminating the stipulation that the BOCs and AT&T must offer their
competitors in the packet switching business free access to their local
telephone connection lines.

 The idea is patently ridiculous.

 Mark Fowler, Chairman of the FCC, has been hailed by the press as a "fair-
market zealot."  The chances are very good that he views this proposed
reregulation as the magic road to increased competition and fairer pricing for
consumers.

 Unofficially, the word is out that the FCC advisory committee now considering
this matter is indeed leaning in favor of the proposed reregulation of the
packet switching industry.  If the committee recommends these changes, it's
likely that a majority of the five voting members on the Federal
Communications Commission will vote in favor of the changes.

 I have talked to sources within the industry who say it is the BOCs who are
pushing VERY HARD for this reregulation, because they want to get into the
packet switching service business in a big way, and they would like to rid
themselves of needless competition on their way to success.

 What's that?  RID themselves of competition?  But--the proposed reregulation
is supposed to FOSTER competition!  Why would a group of companies (BOCs)
hoping to eliminate their competition PUSH for this reregulation?  I hope the
answer to THAT question is entirely clear.

 Here we have an industry that is currently populated with plenty of
competition.  Prices are already reasonable.  Reregulation of the packet
switching service industry will IMMEDIATELY give giant corporations the upper
hand, and will allow them to cut off free access to their local access phone
lines to their competitors, namely Telenet and Tymnet and other similar
services that now offer you high-quality service, in a competitive
marketplace, at reasonable prices.

 The proposed reregulation, however, would force all packet switching services
to compete with the BOCs and AT&T, companies that would be able to use the
enormous profits they earn with their voice telephone services to cross-
subsidize their packet switching services and offer them on a non-compensatory
basis, at least until their competitors are eliminated.  When that happens,
they are then sure to jack up their fees to any level they want.

 It would also force their packet switching competitors to pay access fees for
connection to local phone lines.  The access fees alone could add as much as
$4.00 per hour to the fees packet switching companies would be forced to pass
on to their customers.	This will be added to your hourly connect-time charges
for accessing ALL online databases through these services.

 The proposed reregulation could very well spell the death of PC PURSUIT.
Because GTE also uses dial-out modems at the other end of their Telenet
connections for PC PURSUIT service, the company would be forced to pay an
hourly charge at BOTH ends of the phone line--totaling up to $8 or $9 per
hour.  These fees would have to be added to the flat $25 per month that GTE
now charges for access to PC-PURSUIT.  It would simply make the final cost to
PC-PURSUIT customers too high for the service to remain practical and
affordable.

 So--this is ONE TIME you MUST use your word processor to produce some letters
opposing this proposed reregulation!  Write to:

 Honorable Mark Fowler
 Chairman of the Federal Communications Commission
 Washington D.C. 20554

 Refer to Computer Inquiry III in your letters.  State clearly, in your own
words, that competitive packet switching services should not be reregulated or
subjected to carrier access charges, and then explain why not.	Tell Mr.
Fowler that reregulation of packet switching services will completely destroy
the existing fair market for these services, and eventually increase costs,
not DECREASE them.

 And hurry!  I have heard this matter will be going before the FCC for a vote
in the latter part of January or early part of February.  Time is running out.

I know someone with an S-100 Z-80 CP/M system that includes
a Solid State Music VB3B video board.
This is a 24x80 character board driving a standard video monitor.
His BIOS has just a "glass tty" driver, i.e. it can send
characters tothe screen one after the other, and obey
CR and LF, but no other cursor positioning.

The only program he has that does full-screen stuff is Wordstar,
which has its own video board driver.

He has a modem on his system and a terminal emulation program
(MODEM7 or one of its derivatives).  Now he wants to be able
to call a host computer and do full-screen terminal emulation,
with some sort of cursor control so he can run screen editors
on the host instead of line editors.

Does anyone have a terminal emulation program I could have
(we might even pay for a commercial one) that emulates a
VT52, H19, VT100, ADM3 or anything else halfway intelligent,
using a VB3B without any CP/M BIOS support for cursor
positioning?

I have the version of KERMIT from Queen's University, written
in Turbo Pascal, that emulates a VT52.  Unfortunately, it
uses the Turbo Pascal screen-management functions.  These can be
easily patched to match any terminal, but won't work with a 
really dumb one; there has to be cursor positioning already
supported.

Thanks in advance for any help.

p.s. Why not add a driver to the BIOS?  The system is so
old it's not worth the time and trouble.  For $150
we could buy a used CRT terminal and avoid the whole problem.

Pardon the posting but a lot of my e-mail has been bounced back,
and I want this reply received on time to be useful.

Barnes and Noble has a good selection at their main store at
17th street and 5th Avenue.  You don't have the time to browse the
Bargain Annex across the street.

I remember a good selection of computer books at Coliseum Books
at 57th Street and Broadway (I believe).  It's near the NY Coliseum.

I also need a good C compiler under CP/M.  I'm on a Kaypro.  Aztec C
would be dandy, but Software Toolworks C would be ok also.

Every once in a while I run across a program that is either binary-only, or

It seems like it might not be too hard to write a conversion RSX to do
translations, and be relatively universal as well.  If someone has an
osborn list and sends it to me, I'd appreciate it.  If there's interest,
I could post the results.

    a "fair market zealot."  The chances are very good that he views this
    proposed reregulation as the magic road to increased competition and
    fairer pricing for consumers.

  In a free market, it would not matter to users whether this
legislation was passed or not.  The legislation does not COMPELL local
phone companies to charge four dollars or more per hour for a local
phone call to a long distance data service (e.g. PC PURSUIT) it merely
ALLOWS them to do so.
  Since it doesn't cost local phone companies any more to complete a
local call to such a service than it costs them to complete any other
local call, phone companies would not lose money by not adding this
charge.  And since any local phone company which chose NOT to charge
extra for such calls would get plenty of business from users who
formerly used any local phone company which DID decide to add the
extra charge, there would certainly be local phone companies which
choose not to add this charge.  This is how the free market works.
  HOWEVER, we unfortunately do NOT have a free market in local
telephone service.  Since each user has no choice which local phone
company to use, thanks to a pernicious government-mandated monopoly,
most local phone companies probably WILL add this charge if they are
allowed to.  They know they won't lose any customers to competing
firms, since there are no competing firms allowed.
  In an ideal world, this legislation would be a good thing.  Phone
companies like any other company should be allowed to charge whatever
they wish for their services, subject only to the constraints of the
marketplace.  But in the context of the captive marketplace, this
legislation would be a very bad thing.  If phone companies are given
a monopoly, their prices have to be regulated by the government, since
they are not regulated by the free market.  Without regulation, they
would be able to charge as much as they could without people abandoning
phone service for bicycle messengers or carrier pigeons.
  Phone service ought to cost the user just a few percent more than
the cost to the phone company of providing the service.  In a free
market, it would.  In a regulated mandated monopoly, it might (how
could anyone ever tell?).  But given an unregulated mandated monopoly,
i.e. the worst of both worlds, the local phone companies will sell
their services for slightly less than the cost to the user of doing
completely without phone service.
  If Mark Fowler is indeed an advocate of the free market system, this
is how it should be explained to him.

So why don't you guys just go ahead and buy your compilers directly from
Aztec or Software Toolworks? They will be very happy to sell you a real
legal copy, and carry both QX-10 and Kaypro formats. Mix also has a C
compiler for just $39, with tons of documentation, a good deal for a
learning tool.

Remember that info-cpm isn't for classified ads (at least on the ARPANET
side).

That's about the size of it too - a learning tool.  Mix C for CP/M is a victim
of terminal neglect.  It does more things wrong than right.  While the MSDOS
version has undergone many revisions in the past year, the CP/M version
remains virtually untouched.  All sorts of problems with blanks, unexpected
reserved words, undocumented error codes, runtime anomalies, etc.  Forget
trying to port any non-trivial program to Mix C, you're wasting your time.

People have written lots on this new FCC rule change ( threat? threat?? ).
Lots of stirring propaganda about regulators who beleive in fairy
tales, monopolies that will screw you to the wall given the chance,
and legislated monopolies. Lots of misconceptions.

First: MODEM calls DO NOT cost the phone company the same amount as
other calls. They tend to be longer, and don't tolerate noise as well.
Anyone who knows ANYTHING about the phone system knows it can only handle
some fraction of the possible calls that might be happening at any one
time, and the longer the average phone call is, the more equipment
will be needed to meet this fraction. If the phone company always
charged for local service BY THE MINUTE, well, no problem, but
phone companies usually charge BY THE CALL or BY THE MONTH. So heavy
modem users are currently being SUBSIDIZED by the rest of the users.
Sounds like it MIGHT be UNFAIR. 

Second: the goverment does not "mandate" a "pernicous" monopoly, it
simply allows it. You or I can go out, get right-of-way on the
utility poles like the cable companies, and start our very own 
telephone system. The problem is you and I would lose big money trying
to compete with the phone system. And our users would be annoyed at
people next door using BELL being a long-distance call. But you can do it,
in fact, General Electric HAS done it, for both its local and long-distance
telephone needs ( known as DIALCOM ).

If ANYBODY needs something explained to him, it is probably NOT Mark Fowler.
Before people rush to pester him, why don't you all invite someone from
the Phone Companies to give THEIR SIDE. This rush to get half-informed 
people to rise up and make trouble is simply electronic rabble-rousing,
NOT what democracy thrives on : informed opinion from people who have
been exposed to ALL SIDES of an issue.

( DISCLAIMER : I'm not neccesarily disagreeing with anyone, nor
  do these opinions represent anybody elses. I could even be wrong.
  But then again, so could you. 'Cause remember ...  No matter 
  where you go, There you are. )		Dennis O'Connor

The reason I posted this to the net is that most of you reading this
are now developing under the *nix environment.  Many of you who may
have bought a 'real legal' copy of the Aztec C compiler no longer use
or need it.  I'm simply offering an oportunity for someone to re-coup
a little of their investment by selling a tool they no longer need.

As it turns out, I ran out of time and so have purchased my own copy
directly.  However, I've received requests from others to turn over
any 'extra' leads to them.

As for MIX C, I've also heard that it's worthless for serious work.
I have tried it, along with SuperSoft, Ecco, and BDS.  None are full
implementations of C (at least in the versions I've got).

How is the C by Software Toolworks?  I understand it is about $50
for CP/M.

Is Software Toolworks C a full implementation (or close)?

Dennis;
	When I had to deal with one of the Intel Boards
about three years ago, I found that Intel supported (had)
a users group called Insight. It cost us about $200.00
to join for the year, but it was like a CP/M Users Group
(an example only) in that you had access to programs written,
and donated by others. If you donate programs, you get credit
toward those you wish to obtain. The only frusterating part
was that you had to join BEFORE you found out IF they had
what you needed. We took the chance, and got what we needed,
and it saved us a BUNCH of time, effort, and bucks.
I'm afraid that this info is three years old, we didn't
renew out membership, as the project was completed.
I'm afraid couldn't tell you how to get to them,
except possibly through an Intel Rep.
I hope this helps, I can't remember what all they had, I do
remember that it seemed extensive at the time, with all sorts
of off the wall programs for specific applications, and
quite a bit of general interest as well.

	Take Care

Hello all,
thank you for all the messages concerning my query about xmodem for the vax.
I have received a copy and everything is doing fine (I think).
I have now another problem:
I have downloaded rsasetup.com. Unfortunately this program hangs up my micro
CRCK4.COM gives as checksum E608. Is this the right checksum??
If the author is listening: I would rather have the Turbo Pascal sources
because I think ther terminal package in Turbo Pascal is driving my micro
crazy. It does not know about the terminal implemented in rsasetup, rsacrypt
and rsaclear.

Can anyone tell me if this package (rsat12.lbr on sigm vol202) is working
properly on any micro or do I have to look for something else.

If you know of any other package concerning public key cryptography (or other
systems) please let me know.. I intend to use it for private messages in Fido
networks and Bitnet.

I have downloaded VFILER for CPM-86 - FASTVF86.LBR on SIGM vol 229.
The LBR includes a doc file, a source (A86) file and an executable.
The program runs OK, but not perfectly since my terminal has some codes
different from a NEC APC.  The doc and source give easy directions for
customizing it, but it didn't work.  I then tried just reassembling the
original A86 file, following the directions, to see if that would work -
it doesn't.  I get BDOS errors with strange files and impossible disks
when I try to run it.  Has anyone tried using this file (on anything
other than an APC) ?  I am using ASM86 ver 1.1, under MPM-86 ver 2.13,
if that means anything to anyone.  I am using a WYSE 100 terminal, though
that doesn't matter since I get errors even before i try to customize
the program.  If noone has any idea what's wrong, does anyone have a similar
type of filer program for CPM-86 ?

They have a good selection of textbooks (undergrad and grad) and monographs;
I've found things there that B&N didn't stock.  They don't take credit cards,
but they did take a personal check from a NJ bank.  All this information is
as of about a year ago.

I have been buying my textbooks and all my technical books from them
for over 3 years now.  They are a fantastic store.  They have almost
everything.  They also give you a ten percent discount and they also
only charge $1.50 for shipping (they ship UPS, BTW).

I've just transferred a copy of what I consider to be a first release
of UNCR.C to simtel20.

Filename			Type	 Bytes	 CRC

Directory PD:<UNIX.CPM>
UNCR231.C.1			ASCII	 12651  0052H

It is portable enough to compile and execute ok on an 8-bit CP/M system,
though about 2.5 times slower than the real UNCR 2.3.  So it's major
application is uncrunching on the host (UNIX, VMS, TOPS-20 ...)
systems.  I've tested it through all it's major paths on a Sun-3, a
VAX-11/780, and the C-128 CP/M.  Here is an abstract:

UNCR231.C is a C language implementation of the LZW decompression
algorithm utilized by Steven Greenberg's Z-80 CP/M program UNCR
Version 2.3 (from PD:<CPM.SQUSQ>CRUNCH23.LBR).  This program will
decompress (uncrunch) any file written with CRUNCH 2.x, although it
will not work with files written by CRUNCH 1.x (an earlier algorithm).
The only requirements placed on the C compiler used are that it
support a long type of at least 4 bytes (actually 21 bits will do),
and that it will read and write files in binary (no newline or ^Z
translation) using getc()/putc() when the files have been opened with
mode "rb"/"wb".  This is absolutely the case for UNIX on 32 bit
machines, but may require some coaxing on other systems, particularly
CP/M and MSDOS compilers.  Note that UNCR231.C is not recommended for
use on z-80 CP/M systems, since the real thing is over twice as fast;
rather it is meant to fill the gap and allow these "crunched" files to
be recovered on more powerful systems where speed is not an issue.
Usage is just:

$ uncr <filename> [<another filename> ...]

If your shell or O.S. does wildcard expansion, by all means use that.
Files not in "crunched" format will be skipped.  The decompressed
files will have the names of the original CP/M files (in lower case if
that is significant on your system).  This program follows in the
footsteps of usq.c and lar.c in attempting to provide a portable
implentation of a popular algorithm.

Sincerely,
Frank Prindle

Subject: Looking for a book on CP/M interfacing

I'd like to write an application program or two and am looking for a book that 
will provide concise and complete information on using CP/M system services 
(BIOS calls).  My MicroPro StarCard came with "The CP/M Primer," by Murtha and
Waite, but there's very little *really* useful info there.  For $2.00 I bought
a remaindered book called "A Practical Guide to CP/M" which isn't all that 
useful, either.  What I need is specific information on what the register
contents should be on entry and exit, where the byte count is returned on a
console read, what anomalous results can occur, etc. 

Thanks in advance,

I'm aware of, and have seen Smart Key II in use.
I am very interested in its companion program,
Smart Print. I need a filter between the output
of a word processor, and a letter quality printer.
The problem is that I need to do foreign language
text processing such as the ' over another character,
the umlaut etc. This requires that the printer
strike, backspace, and strike again. Neat trick, except
that the word processor will count this as three
characters, and justify accordingly. I hope to find
a public domain 'filter' that will recognize an otherwise
unused chacachter such as ] or [ and substitute the
appropriate strike, backspace, strike sequence.
Anyone had to 'deal' with this problem?
And /or know of an existing program that will
filter the text for me? Any help will be much
apppreciated.

Subject:  Useful new product for CP/M and some related operating systems:

Fellow CP/Mers - In keeping with my periodically announced policy (copy sent
upon request) of posting announcements of new commercial products that are of
general interest to the CP/M community, here is a description of a software
product from Plu*Perfect Systems that adds to CP/M the ability to switch back
and forth between two active tasks without losing the current status of
either. This feature is one that I have come to dearly love as a regular user
of the UNIX operating system.  Quite often, I find that while involved with
one task I need information from another.  For example, when answering
correspondence I frequently need to refer to the message to which I am
responding.  If I know from the start that I will need to do that, I use the
two-window mode of our message program; but if I find out too late, it is
extremely handy to be able to suspend the editor job and go back and read the
message.  Other scenarios are more likely for the CP/M environment, but the
one just given was the first to come to mind.  The new product, known as
"BackGrounder ii", also provides a print spooler and a number of additional
functions that appear to be quite useful.

     A demonstration version is available from the SIMTEL20 archives in file:

		       PD:<CPM.BKGROUNDER>BGIIDEMO.LBR

It includes all BGii features, but is restricted to drive A: and lacks the
spooler and other utilities.  Patches for WordStar 3.0 and 3.3 that redraw the
screen in response to a control-backslash are also provided so that the user
can see the text he is editing after he returns to a suspended editor task.
However, these patches do not require the BackGrounder product, and appear to
be generally useful (I tried the one for WS 3.3, and it worked fine on a
TurboDOS computer without BGii).  The files in the demo library have been
compressed using the CRUNCH utility (which, by the way is rather impressive in
its ability to achieve compression factors in excess of two-to-one).  A copy
of the uncruncher is included in the library, but it did not operate properly
on the TurboDOS system on which I tried it.  Fortunately, the fix was
available from the archives:  File:

			 PD:<CPM.SQUSQ>CRUNCH23.LBR

contains a complete CRUNCH package including the cruncher, uncruncher,
documentation and a note describing how to patch the cruncher and uncruncher
so that they will work correctly under TurboDOS.

     Before attempting to use the demonstration software, users are urged to
read the following files from the library:

		-CRUNCH.NOT for uncrunching instructions
		BGIIDEMO.DOC for summary of features and files
		DINSTALL.PRN for detailed installation steps

     The complete BGii system, with printed and indexed user's manual, can be
obtained from Plu*Perfect Systems, Box 1494, Idyllwild CA 92349.  The price
is:
		     $75 + 6% in California + $3 shipping.

Other sources are listed in the documentation.

     The following information has been provided by the vendor, and I have no
personal experience with the product.  Additional information can be requested
from the author at the following address:

			      BackGrounder ii


			       MAJOR FEATURES


TASK SWITCHING

      On user command, switch between two active programs, each with full
memory.


BACKGROUND COMMANDS

      Run built-in BackGrounder ii commands from within an active program,
as well as at CP/M prompt:

      bg     calc  cls   cut     date  dir    echo  era     feed  find  forms
      flip   go    get   help    jot   jump   keys  list    ndr   note  ocp
      paste  peek  poke  printr  ren   reset  save  screen  shift
      spool  swap  time  type    user  whl    whlq

Supports ZCPR3 syntax: DU:filename.typ, named-directory, multiple-command
line.


BACKGROUND LIST SPOOLING AND PRINTING

     Redirect list output to file.  Print files from a queue while running
programs.


CUT-AND-PASTE

     Transfer screen region to notepad, another program, or printer (requires
screendriver).


KEYBOARD MACROS

     Pre-defined, on-the-fly, and record-keystroke capability, both global
and program-specific.   Load and save macros within a program.


EXTENSIBLE COMMANDS

     Add customized, user-coded assembly-language foreground and background
commands.


			        REQUIREMENTS

NECESSARY

     Z80 or equivalent CPU, standard CP/M 2.2 BDOS, or ZRDOS v. 1.1, 1.2, 1.3,
or 1.7.


RECOMMENDED

     Ram-disk or hard-disk.


DESIRABLE

     Video-mapped memory, or terminal with transmit-character or transmit-
region function.


MEMORY AND DISK SPACE

     Standard system: 2.75K memory + 2K of CCP space.

     ZCPR3 system:    0.25K memory + 2K of CCP space, if RCP and IOP are
                      reclaimed.

     100K swap file.


				COMPATIBILITY

     Runs all CP/M 2.2 programs that adhere to CP/M addressing standards,
subject to above memory limit.

     Supports all ZCPR3 external environment buffers, including task-specific
shells.

     Unspooling may drop keyboard characters if the BIOS lacks a type-ahead
buffer.


				 PERFORMANCE

     BGii uses a pre-allocated disk file as virtual memory for overlays and
task-switching buffers.  Ram-disks work best, and tuned hard-disks are also
effective.  On floppy-disk systems, BGii can be used well as an extended
command processor for one task; however, task-switching is too slow to be
used as a regular floppy feature.

     Representative 58-60K tpa swap times:

	SB180   	6 Mhz	ram disk			< 1 sec
	Kaypro 10	4 Mhz	Advent ram disk			< 2 secs
	Kaypro 10	4 Mhz	Turborom, hard disk, 1K sectors	  4 secs
	Kaypro  2	5 Mhz	Turborom, DSDD 1K floppy	~20 secs


			 SCREEN-RELATED FEATURES

     BGii uses optional terminal-specific screendrivers to save and restore
the working screen and to implement cut-and-paste, notepad, and screen-dump
commands.  Screendrivers are available for Kaypro '83, Kaypro '84, and
Heath/Zenith 19 computers/terminals.  ASM source code and documentation for
these drivers permits modification for other terminals that have a transmit-
character or transmit-region function.

     If no screendriver is installed, BGii can send a user-defined macro
to the running program to cause it to redraw the screen, if it has that
capability.  Patches to add this feature to WordStar v 3.0 and 3.3 are
included.

There is an excellent series of application notes regarding Z80 interrupts
and asynchronous communications in Zilog's "Microprocessor Applications
Reference Book, Volume 1." There are two in-depth articles on asynchronous
applications of the DART/SIO, as well as a good article on synchronous SIO
programming. In addition, there are several other articles that deal with
interrupt-driven use of the CTC, etc. Each article includes commented
assembly language code.

You should be able to obtain a copy of this book from Zilog Sales and
Technical Center, 10340 Bubb Road, Cupertino, CA 95014. Their phone number
is (408) 446-9848. These books were often given free of charge to designers
using the Z80, so perhaps Zilog will sell one for a nominal cost.

I do what you're talking about frequently - probably on a daily basis.  A
simple filter may be a cheap way to deal with your problem, but it's a
band-aid, and it is guaranteed to get in your way more than it helps out. 
What you might think about instead is investing in a better word processor. 

A good word processor will *not* count a char-<BS>-char sequence as three 
characters and misjustify the output.  I use WordStar, and WS handles this
function quite well.  In the WS installation sequence, you can tell WS about 
your printer:

a.  Backspacing printer - able to backspace and overstrike the same character

b.  Non-backspacing printer - print the entire line and issue <CR> without
    accompanying <LF>, then restrike all overstruck character positions on
    the line

When editing, you enter the backspace command the same way regardless of how 
your printer is installed, and WS figures out how to print things.

WordStar is disgustingly cheap at present, at least in its IBM or Apple CP/M 
incarnations - something like $120 will get you WS Professional, which 
includes Spellstar, MailMerge, and StarIndex.  Sure, there are *nicer* WP 
packages available now, but WS is still about the most powerful one around.
If WS isn't to your liking, try some of the other good WPs, such as Paper 
Clip or WordPerfect.

VMSSWEEP.FOR.28			ASCII	 53386  ED78H

I have modified V2.7 of VMSSWEEP to extend the EXTRACT and VIEW
functions to process all of the members of library.  It does this by
accepting at the member number prompt a number greater than the
maximum number of members, and interpreting this as "all members".
The prompt indicates this option by suggesting "(9999 for all)".

It also fixes a problem in which unacceptable VMS file names were
generated if the member names had the 8th bit set.  I don't know how
such libraries got created in the first place, but this version strips
8th bits off of the file names.

This version does NOT correctly handle members CRUNCHed with the
latest LZW algorithm, which typically have names of the form "*.?Z?".
VMSSWEEP will hang on these files.

Incidentally, V2.7 corrected the problem with some .ARC libraries
which caused older versions to report CRC errors.  This showed up in
the DRACO libraries.

I have taken the liberty of naming this version V2.8.

Just invested in a hard disc which arrived a week after order (coast to

When I phoned in the order, they found my name in the address database
(even though it had been almost a year since last order), updated
the address and got with the hardware.

Hardware house only -- no software to speak of.

This in response to my message to Shawn Miner in re: his query for a filter to
handle overstriking sequences via backspacing. 

True, you should be able to turn off the justify option.  With WordStar, and 
with most other good WPs, you can.  But turning off justification is not in
itself sufficient.  Consider the following nonsensical bit of French 
philosophy:

    Ca, c'est la boite noire de noel bien aimee qui doit rougir qu'on la
    connaitrait. 

(Rough translation, "That's the well-loved black Christmas box that must blush
so that it may be known."  Pardon the rust; I've had little opportunity to
speak French in the last 20 years.) 

This example, of course, lacks six diacritical marks that should be there. 
To print it with marks, by backspacing, requires twelve "extra" characters in
the text - with justification turned off, you'll get one awfully short line in
the middle of your text, or maybe two slightly short ones.  For drafts, and
for many other uses, that's okay.  But it's not acceptable if you're trying to
produce professional printed copy.  For that, you need justification.  A good
WP understands all this.  WordStar counts a <BS> and one following character
as no characters and thereby does not screw up the character count.  Justified
or not, the printed text will have lines as full as possible.  I surmise that 
other WPs are as intelligent.

Writing a filter to handle all the justification, character-counting, bolding, 
underscoring, line-overstriking, discretionary hyphenation, etc., that a truly
good WP does, seems to me a trifle in the line of far too much work for far
too little return, without even considering the hassle of using such a filter.
Such a filter defeats the purpose of a WP - why not just use ED and then run
the result through your filter??  No, thank you, not me.

Message-ID: <3841@utcsri.UUCP>
Date: 30 Dec 86 01:12:29 GMT
To:       info-cpm@AMSAA.ARPA

There was some demand for this, so here goes.

APPLICABILITY:
	Microsoft MACRO-80 assembler, version 3.44.
	The title of an assembler listing shows:
		MACRO-80 3.44   30-Mar-82

EFFECT:
	(1) upper and lower case in symbols become distinct. External
	symbols are passed to the linker L80 with their case intact.
	L80 and LIB80 don't seem to have any trouble with the lowercase
	letters. Macro names are also dualcase; you may define a macro
	'call' which does not conflict with the mnemonic CALL.

	(2) As a side-effect of (1), predefined symbols such as mnemonics,
	assembler directives, and register names must be in UPPER case.

	(3) The warning message '%No END statement' becomes '%No END'
	[ I had to get a few bytes from somewhere...]

	(4) WEIRDNESS:: The symbols are shoved into buckets based on their
	first letter. After the patch, 'FOOBAR' and 'frobozz' go into the
	same bucket. The problem is that the table lookup code assumes that
	each bucket contains symbols with the same initial letter, so
	'foobar' will conflict with 'Foobar'. I don't know whether this
	can be fixed. The initial letter *is* stored in the symbol table,
	since 'foobar' and 'Foobar' are both propogated intact into the
	object module (provided only one of the two is defined).
	L80 does not suffer from this problem.

PATCH:
-----------------------------------
 OFFSET	    ADDRESS
(in file) (in memory)	WAS   BECOMES
   40B	       50B	20	00
			73	D6
			74	3B
			61	E6
			74	1F
			65	4F
			6D	C9

   A82	       B82	20	00

   BFC	       CFC	D6	C3
			3B	0C
			4F	05
-----------------------------------

People who already have large run-time object libraries with all uppercase
globals will need to reassemble them with the patched assembler in order to
call them from C using lower case symbols. Perhaps a more useful patch would
invert the case; a call to printf() would refer to the global 'PRINTF', and
the function FooBar would appear to the linker as 'fOObAR'. All predefined
assembler words would then have to appear in lowercase. If there is any
demand for such a weirdness, I will get out my byte-bashing utilities
and figure out the patch (If I remember correctly how the above patch
works, the case-inverting patch is quite simple).

To: INFO-CPM@AMSAA.ARPA

Message-ID: <12266848113.6.WANCHO@SIMTEL20.ARPA>

With all those ads for dirt-cheap high-capacity hard disk drives
(relative to just a few years ago), just what would I need to buy to
hook one of those drives to my S-100 NorthStar Horizon, mostly running
TurboDOS these days?  What interface do most of these drives use/need?
Are they mostly ST-506-compatible, or SCSI, or what?

I have several ways to go depending on the answer.  For example, if
they were ST-506, I could probably get a TurboMaster card with a
built-in ST-506 interface and the TurboDOS drivers to go with it.
(The catch is that I haven't yet heard of a mod for it to allow me to
block out the 1K I need at the top of Bank 0 so I can keep my N* disk
controller in the system.)  Other hard disk controller cards pose
problems of their own, such as one of the old Morrow cards or the
CompuPro DISK3 - i.e., some know historical problems with these cards
on the N* S-100 bus with the N* ZPU card, plus the possible lack of
TurboDOS drivers to support them.

Now, if these drives can use the so-called SCSI interface, perhaps I
can consider using the AMPRO SCSI add-on, if they still sell it.  But,
as I recall, it wasn't quite up to the full SCSI spec - something
about limits on the number of devices or device addresses or somesuch.
That, of course, may be academic if you only plan to hook up one or
two of these drives.

In any event, the question remains: what interface do these cheap hard
drives expect?  (What do they expect if you don't buy the PC interface
card normally sold with these drives?)  I'll compile a list of brand
name, model number, interface, and recommendation when and if I
receive sufficient replies.

Thanks,
Frank

on my Altos 586 to read Double Density (instead of Quad) diskettes.  It
actually couldn't be any simpler.  MODE.CMD set it to single, double, or
Altos format.  In double-density mode, the drive reads an IBM PC CP/M-86
diskette that I had paid $25 to get converted several months ago to Altos
format.  The MODE command is NOT in the Altos documentation - I checked and
rechecked after I discovered the program.  One of the Altos manuals (not
the MPM-86 manual) does mention that the drive can read double-density
diskettes (though not single-density) so I always knew it could be done,
I just didn't know - it was right in front of me the whole time....
I don't know if there are any other Altos 586/986 users out there, but
if there are I hope this helps.

My sister-in-law uses a Kaypro iV with CP/M, but this is
mostly a WordStar question: How can you get the underline
to fill the spaces between words?  I have wanted to
do this from time to time myself, but always come up
empty handed, and just put up with the way WS does it.
She can not; there is some peculiar nursing journal format
she has to conform to.  I've wondered about the non-break-space,
but that's such a pain!  Any easy answers?

There are two ways that I know of to accomplish what you want.  

First, of course, is to use the non-break space, but I agree that it's a pain.

The second way assumes that your printer (your sister's, actually) has a 
command code to turn on continuous underline.  If that is the case, there is a 
WS patch called ANYCODE that will do what you want.  The original ANYCODE was 
created by Doug Hurst.  I rewrote it to handle what I felt were two very 
severe limitations it had - my version is called ANYCODE2, and it is upward 
compatible with Doug's ANYCODE.

ANYCODE2 uses two characters as flags to initiate special sequences.  

1.  A back accent (" ` ", hex 60) will cause ANYCODE2 to collect the next two
    characters, which must be valid hex-ASCII characters (0123456789ABCDEF)
    and convert them into a single ASCII character for transmission.  For
    example, this sequence: 

	whatever text `0Fexpanded text`12 some more text

    will cause the words "expanded text" to be printed double-wide on an Epson
    printer.  The `0F is an ASCII <SI> and the `12 is a <DC2>. 

2.  A tilde (" ~ ", hex 7E) will cause the same action except that an <ESC>
    will be transmitted FIRST, before the constructed character.  For example,
    this sequence:

	~4E`08

    will transmit <ESC> N <BS> which will cause an Epson printer to set for
    an eight-line perforation skip between pages.  You could do the same
    thing this way:

	`1B`4E`08

    but using the tilde is more convenient.

ANYCODE2 allows you to use lowercase characters in your code sequences, so 
that `4e will be read the same as `4E.  It also allows you to print the two 
special leadin characters by repeating them - this sequence:

	an ``enclosed' word

will print as:

	an `enclosed' word

ANYCODE2 is in 8080 code and can be assembled and installed into WS using DDT 
under CP/M.  It goes into a special patch area provided and does not increase
the size of the WS.COM file. 

To do continuous underlining, create your WS file as you want it, and then go 
back and, with margin release set, insert the code sequences to turn 
continuous underlining on and off.  You can do this very easily by creating a 
text block containing one sequence, plant it everywhere you want it, and then 
create another block for the second sequence.  You have to do all the 
justification and so forth that you want BEFORE inserting the code sequences, 
because WS sees these sequences as "real" characters in the file.

I don't have a way to upload ANYCODE2 to a BBS anywhere - no serial line on my 
home machine.  If there is interest in ANYCODE2, send email to me, and I'll
bring a copy of the source listing to work and type it in for upload or
posting.

To get a continuous underline in WS, you have to fill the blanks
with '___'s.  A bit clumsy, but it works.

Does anyone know the difference between various CPM disk formats ?
I am using an Altos 586, which I recently discovered can read
double-density (as opposed to quad or 96 tpi) disks.  This worked
for a disk that was in IBM CPM-86 format.  Does anyone know if this
is the same as (or close enough to) Kaypro 2 CPM ?  Kaypro 2 CPM is
the only 5-1/4" CPM format for BYTE Listings on Disk.  If I can
read that format I may get some of those disks.  The Altos manual
doesn't mention the MODE command I used to read the IBM disks, so
it obviously doesn't tell me what other disks I can read, if any.
Any info. will be greatly appreciated.

DO NOT GET THIS COMPILER!!!

I got one and the stupid thing stacks the arguements to subroutines in
REVERSE ORDER!!! This makes routines like printf and scanf very awkward.
They have to define a macro which expands into two calls; the first to
a routine that marks the stack position in a global variable, then they
call a bastardized printf that looks at the args backwards from the
global variable content.

Now, if you can live with that crap, I have nothing but contempt
for you.

I have a small problem.  Small floppies, that is.  I have a number of large
files on my hard disk, and would like to back them up on floppies .   Apple
5.25 floppies only hold 126k; what do I do with these 180k .LBR's?

Any suggestions would be appreciated.  Also, if anyone knows of a backup/restore
utility that will split files, please mail back.  I posted that question about
a month ago, and didn't receive one reply.  Hard to beleive I'm the only person
with this problem.

Thanks in advance.  Happy New Year!

Joe.

The printer is a CITIZEN, not a Century.  Anyway, the problem is that
I can't get Wordstar to work with it.  Any help would be apprecialted.
Is there a significant difference between the MS/DOS "serial",
"parallel" winstall results and the cp/m "primary list device?"

     WordStar should work just fine with the CP/M LST: device.  Make sure you
are not defining a protocol to be used, or any hardware ports, or anything
like that.  Let your operating system handle it.  That's all I'm doing right
now.
