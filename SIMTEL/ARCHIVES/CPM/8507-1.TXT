Subject: VMENU37
To: info-cpm@AMSAA.ARPA

Re the recent upload to VMENU, two items:

	1. The message said that VMENU is now a "true shell"; VMENU has
always been a ZCPR3 shell since the Z3 release a year ago.  An improved
technique, which decreases the shell installation time by about 50%,
is now being employed in shell designs under Z3.  This technique
has the shell look into the CL buffer to see if anything follows, and,
if not, the shell proceeds to execute.  The original design did
not do this, simply returning to the OS and letting Z3 load and invoke
the shell as a shell almost immediately.  This caused a second,
unnecessary load when the shell was first installed.  See Chapter
6 (on shells) and Chapter 5 (on menu subsystems) in ZCPR3:
The Manual for a lot more detail.  Also see the shell manipulation
routines in Z3LIB.

	2. I have not yet been informed by Echelon that VMENU 3.7 has
been approved.  As such, I recommed that users approach with care.
One of the biggest differences between the version
control of Z2 and Z3 is that Echelon plays the role of configuration
manager on all Z3 software releases.  Users are encouraged to change the
software if they like, but releases are to be done thru Echelon.  There
is a file checkout mechanism, which insures that people aren't wasting
effort by working on the same file at the same time, and Echelon runs tests
on the released files before it approves the release.  While this does not
guarantee that no bugs creep in, it helps a lot.  I'm no exception
to this rule -- I currently have SYSLIB, Z3LIB, and VLIB checked out,
and Echelon will test the software after I check it back in.

		Rick

PS If the situation with VMENU has gotten out of hand, it is quite possible
that the uploaded VMENU 3.7 is not the same as that which
will be released.  Al Dunsmuir currently has VMENU checked out.

Mark,

I'm currently using Manx Aztec C on a CP/M system to write control code
for xerographic devices within Xerox.  I've had good results with it (it
is almost a full implementation minus bit fields).

I currently support interrrupts, but you'll have to write your own
context saving mechanism (just save all the registers).  Floats may be a
problem within interrupt handlers, I don't know if you want to compute
there.

Supposedly, it is fairly easy to generate rommable code with the
compiler.  They support an initialized and uninitialized data array with
their linker.  However, doing these things are feasible but often a
pain.  The first time is always the hardest.

By mixed language programming, I assume you mean support for assembly
language.  You can imbed assembly language within your C code and also
write assembly language subroutines if you maintain the Aztec calling
conventions.

In addition, I found the code generation mechanism isn't too bad.  I
also use Aztec to support 6502 applications, but that is a different
story altogether.

I (also) bought a copy of the MIX editor for CP/M.  I think that they
have done a good job on this editor, excepting one slight lack which
makes the product useless for me-- the editor does not know what to do
with control characters in files that you edit.  This includes such
interesting characters as formfeeds and tabs.  MIX will offer to convert
LEADING tabs to spaces for you during editing, and back again when writing
out the file, but to my way of thinking, this is not enough.

If editing these control characters doesn't come up for you, MIX seems to
be really good.  I hope that they work on this problem so that I can use
it, too.

The maximum storage space depends on the block size your BIOS uses.  CP/M
allows up to 64K blocks, each block can be 1, 2, 4, 8, or 16K as I recall.
An even more limiting feature (?) is only 16 blocks can be allocated to the
directory.  Assuming you use 2K blocks (32 MB disk capacity possible), you
can have only 1024 directory entries...

I hope this helps and, even tho I don't have the manuals here for reference,
I think the numbers quoted are reasonably accurate.  I'm currently in the
process of hacking up my BIOS to add a couple of 8 MB disks and remember
looking all this up in order to decide block size and determine my DPB.
It sounds like you have an improperly defined DBP if your directory is
getting wiped out.

Before I say anything (while I still have your attention), please
note that I do not have access to the net, much less this newsgroup.
I have mailed this artical to a good friend who has posted it for
me (And I don't think she reads net.lang.forth or net.micro.cpm). 
So please

use your 'f'-key or your 'r'-key to reply to this artical, but reply

Microcomputing put out a couple of articals once on how to write
your own FORTH interpreter/compiler, written for a CP/M machine in
8080 assembly language.  Someone with whom I've since lost touch
gave me copies of the articals, which I have been using as a guide
to do an implementation on my C64.  I've gotten a lot of the work
done, but right at the end of the second artical (the one about the
compiler), I discovered that there were a couple of listings that
came after the textual part of the artical that my friend neglected
to give to me.  Which brings me to the point of this posting:

If anybody has hardcopies, on-line listings, or can point me to
where I can get copies of those listings, I would appreciate it if
you would get in touch with me at

Columbia moved kermit from cucs20 (columbia-20) to cu20b a while
back when cu20b joined the net.  For a while they maintained both,
but I guess they have removed it from cucs20.

ftp to cu20b, login anonymous, and have fun with kermit:


One small problem, however.  Due to phys. plant maintenance, cu20b
will be down this weekend.

Subject: More on AMPRO Little board BIOS
To: info-cpm@AMSAA.ARPA
Message-ID: <TYM-ACB-793EU@OFFICE-2>

Some problems never seem to get fixed.

My wife has been using an Ampro Little Board for over a year now for a writing 
project.  I put together a system including TEAC 55B and 55F drives for her.  
One of the chronic problems with the Little Board and the TEAC drives has been 
intermittant write errors.  The latest version (received a few weeks ago) of 
their BIOS shows that in the past the problem may even have been solved.  It 
ain't today.  The problem:

How long do you wait for the heads to settle.  The controller has a really good
idea that 1 second is good if the motor was not running (and the heads are not 
loaded) but Ampro has tried several attempts at optimization which are all 
failures.

Katie started having trouble with bad writes after file saves from Magic Wand. 
MW always writes to a brand new file which it opens before it allows any 
editing.  There are no disk reads involved as output to a new file only 
requires allocation of blocks.  So this problem is the same one observed with 
MODEM transfers where the writes are after pauses long enough for the motors to
stop.

Well Katie had been running on an old version of the BIOS which clearly had the
problem as there was almost no wait time for the motor to start.  The latest 
release "fixes" the problem by waiting for several revolutions (requires 
several good reads of sector id of the same id ) after starting the motor.  
Still broke!

Apparently older TEAC drives slow down (longer head load times) as his started 
to become a burden just this week.  I got out my trusty AM radio and tuned into
a good buzz and started poking around with DU.  When writing to the TOP side 
(the side with the loading head) nothing starts to happen until the head slams 
to the surface.  In this case the current 3 revolutions for the heads to settle
is quite adaquate.  On the BOTTOM side the ID reads happen before the flux in 
the head solenoid had even started to build up.  The write operation starts 
even before the head is loaded and the head slams to the surface in the middle 
of the write.  The head hitting the disk rattles the disk and completely 
destroys any synchronization that may have been achieved before the write 
began, result: BDOS BAD SECTOR.  Two weeks ago the head came down either before
the write started or AFTER the write ended!.

The only thing that works ALL the time is the technique used in a very early 
BIOS version.  Turn on the bit in the Disk Controller commands that causes a 1 
second pause whenever the motor is started.  If the motor is already running, 
the pause is not executed.  1 second is not a very long time to wait to insure 
that your data gets written on the disk!  The current BIOS just isn't good 
enough!  So maybe my drives are a little slow! Big deal!

The patch is really very easy.  The MOTOR ON routine has a few READ ID commands
in it for Ampro's "optimized" timing.  Simply patch on the Motor Pause bit for 
these READ ID operations and all your troubles are over.  Peace  !!  I hope 
that someone is saved an aggravating day by reading this.  Incidentally  I 
bought a TEAC 53B drive and like it a lot.  No head loading and very quiet 
seeks!

I would like information on the following:

1) Has anyone out there installed ZCPR3 on a Kaypro "luggable"?  We couldn't
   do it.  Some points: we DO NOT have the CP/M macro assembler, we tried
   assembling with the plain-vanilla assembler and a DIFFERENT macro ass-
   embler than was used in the installation instructions.  Could this have
   been the problem?  Other than that, we followed installation instructions
   as closely as possible.  If you want more details from which to help us,
   please ask.

2) Does anyone know the format of a WordStar created file?  I know some things:
   CR/LF pair ends a line, if the high-bit is set on the LF it ends the page,
   ctrl-S toggles the underlining.  Can anyone out there tell me more info?

3) There is no third question.

Thanks in advance,

To follow up my earlier request to the net for help with sample CP/M-80
BIOS listings for adding a Xebec S1410 controller and two Shugart SA606
Winchester drives to my system with a CCS 2422 FDC, I got a few suggestions
and comments that indicated others may be interested in doing the same thing
but no specific help.  Even so, I now have the hardware running with BIOS
mods I hacked together and can verify that such a task is not impossible.
The drives formatted to 8.2 MB each with no problems so far.

Source information:  (I have no connection, just satisfied customer.)
The Shugart SA606 drives were $150 each and the Xebec S1410 SASI Controller
was $125 from Paramount Electronics, 649 Arques Ave., Sunnyvale, CA 94086,
(408) 773-9595.  The Xebec S-100 Host Adapter I ended up using was $90
from Hamilton-Avnet.  For a sample BIOS and a diagnostic program in Z80
assembly language, feel free to contact me at the address below.

I have used several C compilers on CP/M and have tried most of the
things you refer to.  All of them produce "com"able code, if you mean
produces a .com file.  I also think all of them require you to go through
and assembler, linker and loader to accomplish this.  If you mean "rom"able,
I know Aztec does it and I think the others will too if you put in the right
ORG statements or whatnot.  There is usually a way even if they didn't design
it in.

1) Aztec.  Expensive at $200, but K&R complete, or more so than most.  Good
library.  Includes its own assembler, linker and librarian.  Slow as mollasses.
I use it because I am familiar with it and didn't want to mess with the
idiosyncrasies of the others (at the time).  No bit fields or preprocessor
macros, but it seems NOBODY has those.  The manual is geared after UNIX (not
a terribly good precedent but OK) which I am sure they developed the language
on.  One of the big plusses about this system is its transportability -- Aztec
makes (virtually) identical compilers for essentially every processor and
operating system.  They even make cross-compilers so you can (for example)
develop on cp/m and run on apple.

2) BDS .  A friend swears by it and it seems fast, efficient and correct.
That is, the compiler seems fast.  I don't know that much about the code
efficiency but he says it is efficient.  $150.  The manual is very good.
No library is as complete as Aztecs, but you can always add your own
library modules to any of these.  BDS was really the CPM C standard
for quite a while, before:

3) C/80 .  for 50$ (might be 60 now) and 20 extra for floating point, the real
bargain in C compilers.  I used an early version of this and didn't like it
because they didn't seem to conform to K&R (at least not the library functions)
and as I was struggling to *learn* the language in the first place, I didn't
want to mess with language variants.  Now, however, it seems to have been
cleaned up significantly.  People seem to love it only second to Turbo pascal,
and amazing things have been written with it.  The people at Software
Toolworks (makers of C/80) have written a lot of stuff with it themselves,
notably MyCalc (best spreadsheet for cpm I have seen; I am told supercalc does
sorts better, but I just like the way MyCalc works.  Amazing that visicalc
made any money at all, considering how limited it was) and Mychess.  Lots of
other people use C/80.  Real nice to have floating point; I think it
comes with Aztec but you might have to pay extra for it.  C/80 is probably
your best bet (at least to get started).

4) Q/C.  The only thing I can say about this is it comes with source code,
written in C.  I don't know how it runs since I've never used it, but if 
you want to know how a compiler is written, this would probably be $95
well spent.  Chances are it is real slow (whereas BDS and C/80 are
written, I believe, in assembly).

What do I prefer?  Well, they all do so many disk accesses, and of
course going in and out of the editor (wordstar) is incredibly time
consuming.  I get very frustrated and am thinking of putting a RAM disk
on my Kaypro with a megabyte (~$450) to speed up *everything*.  But it seems
such a waste for most tasks, which are fast.  I keep hearing rumors about:

5) Turbo C.  Vaporware at the moment, but if it is anything like Turbo P,
it will be worth waiting for.  They may have put all their efforts 
into Modula-2, but we can hope.  I would by Turbo C in a second, and
be off and running.  Failing that, I may just give up the wait and
buy Turbo Pascal.

Some of the public IBM bulletin board systems are using a program called
ARC.EXE to pack related files into "archives".  In the past, this has
been done with "LU*" library utility programs.  I think the library
utility programs are to be preferred for the following reasons:
.
1) They are public domain, whereas ARC.EXE is a product of System
   Enhancement associates and asks for a "donation".
.
2) The LU programs are well documented. Gary Novosielski wrote the
   first version in C.  The documentation for current versions is
   in LUDEF5.DOC.  Some versions have source available.
.
3) Library programs exist on mainframes such as Unix and DEC-20 that
   will handle .LBR files.
.
4) The format is compatible with CP/M-80 .LBR files, so the CP/M user
   can handle them (altho not run the executable).
.
5) LBR utilities exist to run executable programs directly from the
   library file.
.
6) Paul Homchick and Vernon Buerg have written high performance versions
   of LU* programs for the IBM-PC.  LUE201.COM is 2688 bytes and will
   extract all members and unsqueeze them if necessary at the same time.
.
7) ARC does result in slightly smaller files. Comparing library files
   with archive files shows .LBR files to be about 1000 bytes larger,
   for .LBR files from 11000 to 40000 bytes in size, apparently because
   a better algorithm is used for packing repeated characters in .EXE
   files. However, I believe the other reasons listed above justify
   using the .LBR programs.

Answer to question number 2:

Basically, a WordStar file is an ASCII text file with the high bit set
to signify certain formatting features.  All control characters using
ctrl-P to enter are stored as straight ASCII, thus typing a ctrl-P
ctrl-B stores a ctrl-B in the file.

The uses of the high bit are as follows, as far as I have determined.
   a high bit on an LF signifies a page break (as you have noted)
   a high bit on a space signifies a "soft" space (used by WordStar to
microjustify)
   a high bit on the last character of a word means that it is part of a
justified paragraph.

Also the hex characters 1E and 1F signify soft hyphens, one being in the
middle of a line, the other at the end (I don't recall which is which).

Using this information, I have been able to write a microjustification
program for dot-matrix printers (WordStar only provides for daisy-wheel
printers).

Answer to question number 3:
   42 :-)

I'd like to add that C/80 produces the smallest and fastest .com files.
BDS-C compiles very fast, but is probably the most non-standard.  For
"standardness" and portability you can't beat Aztec.

Personally, I have a short fuse, so I stick with Turbo Pascal, which
doesn't tax my patience at compile time.

I recommend referring to the very complete review of C compilers
published recently in Computer Language magazine.

A few quick follow-up notes to the discussion of various CP/M C compilers: 

1)  Aztec *does* support parameterized pre-processor macros.

2)  The icky thing about the BDS compiler is that it is somewhat
    non-standard.  Another thing is that, at least in earlier versions
    (here's hoping this has been fixed), the compiler didn't know about
    floats.  There was floating point support in the libraries, however.

My version of Aztec C for CP/M-80 (1.05g) definitely supports

Hello,

I am looking for instructions on how to read the CPM/86 command line from
within Turbo Pascal specifically.

I have found the location of the command buffer, but it appears to be a
circular referenced affair. What I need is the pointer location if my
assumptions are correct, or any flames that might lead me in the correct
direction should my assumptions be wrong.

I will appreciate any and all advice as I haven't much hair left.

Thanks!

Subject:   using both side of disks
ReSent-From: KPETERSEN@SIMTEL20.ARPA
ReSent-To: Info-Cpm@AMSAA.ARPA
ReSent-Date: Thu 11 Jul 1985 05:54-MDT

Whether it is a good idea to use both sides of a floppy disk depends
on two things:

1)  Is the magnetic material on both sides of the disk error-free.

2)  Are the disks designed to be "flipped".  That is, can the disk
    safely rotate in both directions with no damage.

Most floppy disks are manufactured with a magnetic coating on *both*
sides.  The disks are then tested to make sure that there are no
defects which would make them unsuitable for data storage.  If one
side of a disk is bad, then it is usually ceritfied as a single-sided
disk, if both sides are good, then it is certified as a double-sided
disk.  When you buy blank disks, it will always say on the box whether
the disks are single or double sided.  Therefore, most single-sided
disks have *known* defects on the uncertified side (you can tell which
side is the correct side because it has the label on it).

All floppy disks have what is known as a "liner".  This is inside the
cover of the disk and it has two main functions: to minimize friction
as the disk is spinning; and to catch and redirect any dirt and dust
which may have found its way into the disk jacket.  There are a wide
variety of liner designs, and some of them are intended for use with
disks that will only be spinning in *one* direction.  Flipping a disk
with such a liner could cause dirt and dust that was trapped by the
liner to be released onto the disk, creating the potential for head or
disk damage.

It must be mentioned that there are really *two* kinds of double-sided
disks.  Some disk drives, (such as the double sided drives in the IBM
PC) have two heads, one for each side of the disk.  Thus they use both
sides of the disk, but the disks always spin in the same direction.
When you "flip" a disk on a single-sided disk drive, such as the
Commodore 1541, the disk will spin in the opposite direction when you
flip it.  Thus there are some floppy-disks on which both sides can be
used, but you might not want to use the *back* side on your Commodore
1541 disk drive because using that side will cause the disk to spin in
the wrong direction.

It is absolutely safe to use both sides of a disk on a 1541 disk-drive
if the disks are certified double-sided on the box, and there is a
write-protect notch cut on both side edges of the disk.  If not, then
it is risky to use the uncertified side for data storage.

If you buy a commercial software product which uses both sides of a
disk, then it is probably safe to assume that they are using the
correct kind of disk.

Ralph,

The following suppliers of rigid disk drives are listed in the spring
84 DEC Rainbow handbook.

CORVUS SYSTEMS
2029 O'Toole Ave.
San Jose, CA 95131
(408) 946-7700

  External winchester drives 5.9 M, 12.1 M, 18.4 M

UNIVATION INC
1037 North Fair Oaks Ave.
Sunnyvale, CA 94089
(408) 745-0180

 5 M removable hard disk with 64-320K RAM
 11 M internal hard disk with 64-320 K RAM

QUCES INC.
3 Quces Drive
Metuchen NJ 08840
(800) 631-5944
(201) 548-2135
 
 10, 16, 20, 42, 57, and 84 M Hard disk subsystems

The June 85 Digital Review had an article on rigid disk drives for DEC
computers, Rainbow to VAX.

Of the vendors listed only digital and Univation were listed for the
Rainbow.
The following Univation list prices were given.

DHD205R-64 5.25 inch 20 MB fixed 5 MB removable 85 msec access time
625KB/Sec
List price $3995

DHD20-64 5.25 inch 20.7 MB fixed 85 msec access time 625KB/Sec
List price $2750

DHD11-64 5.25 inch 11 MB fixed 80 msec access time 625KB/Sec
List price $2160

I hope you find this info useful, if you had an IBM PC you can get a 10
MB drivesetup for about $600 and 20 MB for about $ 800.

A while back Advanced Computer Products had a close on the DEC 5 MB
Rainbow
upgrade for $750, but none are left.

Also please note unless you have thre Rainbow 100B you will have to
replace the power supply as the 100A power supply can not supply a
rigid.

Sad note, you can buy a Tandy 1200 with 10 Meg Hard Disk($1995) for less
than the cost of any of the above!

I have been using the following method for reading the command line
arguments from Turbo Pascal. (CP/M-86 version 2.0, Turbo Pascal version
2.0)

Declare the following global variable:
var

   CmdLine : String[128] absolute(DSeg:$80); { this is the location of
the CP/M 86 Command line buffer}

   CmdLineString : String[128]; { used to save the command line }

You must execute the following code before your program does any IO and
destroys the buffer !

CmdLineString := CmdLine; { Copies the command line args into the safe
area}

Note that if length(CmdLine) = 0 then no args were passed.
The data format of Dseg:$80 is as follows:
The byte at Dseg:$80 is the nunber of characters passed in the cmd line
after the name of the .CMD file called including the leading space. This
will be CmdLine[0] in the Turbo Pascal string. Thus the string is
returned by CP/M in the same format as required by Turbo.

The same method can be used for CP/M 80 except the declaration is:
CmdLine : String[128] Absolute $80;

And for MS-DOS
CmdLine : String[128] Absolute(CSeg:$80);

It is my understanding that the CP/M-80 versions only allow a limited
number of characters to be passed as arguments(arround 30) I have not
verified this for any of the implementations.

Turbo Pascal 3.0 includes 'standard' procedures for reading the command
line arguments.

Does anyone know of a good terminal emulator for an old Vector Graphic
VIP micro using CP/M? It's a Z-80 based machine with a single sided, double
density disk drive.  Support of full screen editors (e. g. vi) on the host
is a requirement; emulating a VT100, or HP2621 is fine.  I will pay
a reasonable price for a suitable commercial product.

More followup on the C compiler commentary.

In article <801@vax2.fluke.UUCP> morgan@fluke.UUCP (Bruce Eckel) writes:

Unlike other C compilers, BDS C does not produce an intermediate
assembler, but produces relocatables directly. This is one of the
reasons for it's compile-time speed. It comes with a program to turn
pseudo-assembler into .CRL files, and a source-level debugger (the only
CP/M-80 compiler to do so, last time I looked). It can be used to
generate rommable code and interrupt handlers (I've done so).

The major loss with BDS C is the I/O library, and no initializers. The
I/O library looks like the PWB library. BDS C is *not* suitable for
writing code for porting to other system, or for porting code from other
systems to CP/M-80. I think it's the best thing around for writing
CP/M-80 code, though.

BDS C is written in assembler (yet another reason for it's speed). C/80
is written in C. In fact, C/80 and Q/C both started from the Public
Domain Small/C compiler. I was never happy with C/80, as the early
version (v2.0) I have is full of bugs. It did produce fast code, by
copying the arguments into a fixed area of memory, and then back onto
the stack for subroutine calls so recursion worked. This was (I think)
the reason that it evaluated and stacked subroutine arguments from left
to right instead of right to left (like nearly every other C compiler I
know of). This quirk could expose portability problems in your code, and
makes the printf function the single ugliest piece of C I've ever laid
eyes on. They may have fixed this by now.

2. Variable blocking factors-i.e., 256, 512, or 1024 bytes/sector.
3. Z80 coded (feature?).

For example, 379 produces "parallel incremental contingency."  No
one knows what that means, but it sounds impressive.

Now, someone truly clever out there in Netland should develop a
module that can be integrated into any word processor so that
when a specially defined key is hit, the module will:

    .   Generate a three-digit random number,

    .   Reach into the table for the Buzz Words, and

    .   Insert the appropriate phrase into the document
        being prepared.


Upward and onward.

Re getting the command line in CP/M-80:  FACT - in Version 1, at least,
of Turbo Pascal, Turbo eats everything after maybe the 30th or 31st
character - puts a bunch of (consistent) garbage there.  I have extensively
tested this and am sorely tried by this particular bug!

Subject: COEX 64k RAM board problems - help needed

I received the following message asking for help:

Date: 12-Jul-85
From: Robb Adams
Re:   COEX 64K RAM BOARD PROBLEMS

Just acquired two COEX (Components Express) 64k Ram cards only to
discover an interesting and persistent bug. It seems that RAM between
1000 - 1fffh is filled with 7eh (0111 1110b) throughout this 4k region
as though b1-6 were jammed high and on BOTH boards. Continuity checks
ok. Anyone know of this problem or bus conflict. The environment is a
Morrow Decision I which has always taken kindly to OEM devices.

Please reply to me.  I will relay any answers to Robb.

I have never dealt with that company, but we (at CMU) use Microprocessors
Unlimited for all of our memory purchases (chips.)  They currently list 
the 41256 chips for $3.25 each.  I think that you will be pleased ith
their service.  Their phone is (918)267-4961.  We have ordered probably
more than a thousand chips from them with no bad ones.

Subject:  Failure of network service to AMSAA.ARPA

Fellow CP/Mers - While I was on vacation (6-13 July), the machine from which
this list is distributed was moved from its normal site to a trailer located
a short distance across the parking lot.  Plans had been made for continuing
network service, and indeed the network was just about the first form of
communications to come up.  Two days ago, we had a real humdinger of an
electrical storm.  Residential electric service was disrupted for many homes.
Another casualty was the AMSAA network interface.

     As you can see, we are now back in netland, but this has been accom-
plished using borrowed equipment.  The loan is short-term, but repair of the
network interface is underway.  If all goes well, there will be no further
interruption of service.  However, Old Man Murphy hangs around here too, so we
make no promises.

     In the worst-case scenario, there is another machine with a light enough
load to host info-cpm.  This machine has just had some new hardware installed,
and it is presently not entirely well.  But what the heck - we wouldn't want
life around here to get dull, would we?

     So for the present, info-cpm is back.  We'll see what the future brings.

Subject:  AMSAA.ARPA network problems persist.

Fellow CP/Mers - It seems that I was a bit hasty in sending my last message.
As it turns out, the machine from which this list is distributed is sort of
"half back on the net".  The lightning that took out the network interface in
the VAX also zapped the IMP port which provides our published network address.
Mike Muuss (pronounced "moose"), one of our system wizards, got AMSAA back on
the local BRLNET by using another IMP port and suitably altering the entries
in the local routing tables.  However, this still leaves us with our published
network address out of action.  Thus, we can send packets out, but no one out
in netland knows the address to use for sending packets back to us.

     I will let you know when this situation improves, but for now there is no
point in sending mail to info-cpm, as it will just be rejected.


Sigh,

Well, everyone has his/her own opinion, but from my experience three+ years
of nearly trouble-free HEAVY use of two Otrona machines in very hostile field
environments [I'm a field marine biologist], this box HAS WORKED FOR ME!  I
guess my view is from the perspective "it gets the job done for me" soooo
much better than B4.  Am aware that there may be much better systems now
[both hardware & software-wise].  Again, the machine has already paid for
itself in utility for my projects.    Aloha,  Jeff Grovhoug

I have a CCS model 400 processor running CP/M 2.2.
I need KERMIT for this machine. I tried a local 
copy of the "generic cp/m" KERMIT but it didn't work.

If I can't find KERMIT a version of MODEM7 for the CCS
might be usefull.

If I can't find either, then some advice on how to configure
generic KERMIT or generic MODEM7 for my machine would be
helpfull.

I have found myself a complexing little puzzle: I want to invoke a new
.COM program from inside MBASIC.  Now, I know MBASIC overwrites the CCP.
So the first thing I will do is find where the CCP starts and use the
/M directive when invoking MBASIC to prevent it from overwriting the
CCP.

I also suspect the CCP may not start at its lowest memory location, so
I will write a little assembly program which pops the CCP return address
off the stack (if you do not disturb the stack, you can just ret from a
program).

Now the problem is, the CCP seems to have its own buffer which it keeps
the command line in.  As the CCP is proprietary, I don't know where that
is (maybe I should know and am just stupid.  Someone enlighten me).  But
the people who write SUBMIT, XSUB and EX know how to do it.  I really
wonder how.  Perhaps they take control of standard input and force it
to the CCP somehow (a warm boot is always executed between programs, so
the CCP gets reloaded, and they can't be diddling with it).  If you
could just feed the thing a line terminated with a CR, you would be home
free.

I am not trying to make any money with this, I just think it would be
a very neat trick.  Any suggestions?

Interesting.  I have *never* seen a disk with notches cut on both sides,
except when I have personally known the person who cut them.  Most 'double
sided' software distribution disks I have seen have actually not had
notches on *either* side.  They must have been produced on duplicating
machines that ignored the presence or absence of write protect notches.

On the other hand, I have the following philosophy on 'flippy' disks --
Because of the dirt entrapment/releasing problem, it is never a good idea
to use the 'back' side of a disk, unless the disk is (almost) brand new.
That means that for day to day use, if you only have a single sided drive,
you should only use the front side of your disks.  Whether you buy disks
marked 'single sided' or 'double sided' is a matter of personal preference,
especially since the price difference is so small, nowadays.  I buy 'double
sided' disks, personally, because of the following observation --  There
*is* one safe use for 'flippy' disks.  That is for distributing software
that is too big to fit on a single side.  In that case, you are going to
use a new -- fresh out of the box -- disk, so you are not worried about
dirt, and the recipient is going to make a backup copy (onto *two* disks!)
as soon as she gets it, then put it away and (hopefully) never have to
read it again, so she is not worried about dirt either.  I do enough
software swapping that I find it useful to have a supply of 'double sided'
disks readily available at all times.

As an aside, I don't think it is possible to design a liner that will not
entrap some dirt, and release it if the disk is spun the other way.  That
just seems like the the inevitable workings of the laws of physics to me.

Enjoy!

	With all of the hoopla that Echelon has been putting on, they have
kept us up to date on several continuing high-performance CP/M systems.  The
first of these systems (based on the Hitachi 64180) has appeared from MicroMint,
the company made famous by BYTE magazine and Ciarcia's Circuit Cellar.  A blurb
has been released describing the board:


        The MICROMINT SB180 computer packs a lot of computing power in
a very small package!  The SB180, only 4" by 7 1/2", offers a Z-80
compatible CPU running at 6 MHz, 256K bytes of RAM, up to 32 K bytes of
ROM, two serial ports, a parallel port, expansion bus, and an industry
standard 765A-compatible disk controller for up to four disk drives -
any combination of 3 1/2", 5 1/4", or 8" drives.  Whether you use the
SB180 as the basis for a complete disk based computer system or use its
32K of ROM space for a battery-powered dedicated controller application
program, you will appreciate its ability to run standard 8080/8085 and
Z-80 software at up to twice the speed of a 4 MHz Z-80.


	The description, price and order information can be found in the full
file on SIMTEL20 as  MICRO:<CPM.GENDOC>SB180.TQT (squeezed format).

Readers of info-cpm - From time to time, people offer items for sale via
usenet news and these notices are gatewayed to info-cpm.  Use of the
government sponsored Defense Data Network (over which we operate) for

that would be to cut the usenet gateway, which most agree would be shooting
ourselves in the foot.

     But dammit, there is NO EXCUSE for carrying on sale negotiations via

is packaged with an unconditional 90 day warranty from the company
mentioned above.I don't know the exact price, but somewhere around
$1000.00.I do know they are factory sealed in the box.I found this
information on a local board (619)283-0498.
    Fora total weight of 20lbs and 5 existing service locations in
this area, its not a bad buy.I understand the the Mari company has

It seems that Yet Another Bye insert for the Apple-Cat II modem has
bombed.  B3AC-0.INS for the BYE335 series of Bye programs has an
"Await Ring" routine that checks for carrier only.  It does not appear
to check for RING.  This may be because you need to have the Firmware
chip in the modem card -- is this true?  I have not been able to get
any Apple-Cat insert working with any of the BYE programs so far
(BYE3, also MBYE with -both- revisions of the insert file).

Are these really bugs, or is the firmware chip required -- There is
quite a demand for Apple-Cat II BYE overlays; perhaps someone with a
bit more ex- perience at assembly language that I would be willing to
contribute this over- lay, a TESTED, WORKING copy, to the MBYE/BYE
collection.

Please reply if you would be willing to write this insert, or if you
know why I am having so much trouble getting this working, or if you
know where I can get a working insert file.  There are many
RCP/M-SysOps who are anxious to get a system running, but have no BYE
insert that seems to work.  I was not able to contact Wayne Masters,
author of the Apple-Cat insert.

  I've just released MEX version 1.14.  It fixes a few long-standing bugs,
and adds support for 1K blocks (as implemented in the current (10.8) 
version of XMODEM.  This enhancement complies fully with Chuck Forsberg's
YMODEM specification for 1K packets.
  The files can be found on SIMTEL20, in MICRO:<MEX> as follows:

		MEX114.LBR	entire package
		MEXOVL06.LQT	List of all known overlays

Note that MEXOVL06.LQT is also present in the two library files, so if
you FTP either of these, you have the overlay list.

Someone please tell Paul Traina that I have just released XMDM109.  I
hear he's working on changes to XMDM108.  Tell him PLEASE use XMDM109!
It's available on my RCPM (Royal Oak) or the Sysop RCPM (Dave Hardy).

After extensive testing of XMDM108 I found a few things that needed
cleaning up.  The changes were not in the area of the file transfer
routines.  XMDM108 is functional.  There was a SERIOUS security
problem, though, that needed to be fixed immediately.  While I was at
it, I set the equates to "generic" so the file could be assembled
without editing for those who just wanted a simple transfer program
between two computers.  You'll find XMDM109.LBR in MICRO:<CPM.RCPM>
after I have uploaded it (I'll announce it).

I have heard that there exist Program Design Languages (PDL's) which are
used to develop preliminary versions of computer programs on larger computers.
Does anyone know if PDL's are available for micros?  I would think that
these design languages would be very useful in the preliminary design of
larger application programs.  If you know of any PDL's for micros, either
commercial or public domain, I would appreciate some guidance.  Thanks in

While the Ada movement has tried to make the concept of PDLs concrete,
the traditional notion is a "pidgen or structured English" statement
of the intent of a procedure; the procedures being produced in a top-down,
step-wise refinement process.  The "syntax" is usually derived from an
ALGOL base (Pascal, Ada, etc.).  The object of a procedure written in PDL
is WHAT the procedure is to accomplish, not HOW.  The key words such as
IF, THEN, WHILE, DO, BEGIN, etc. are there with the expressions and 
statements replaced with ENGLISH language statements.  An example:

     WHILE train has not arrived DO
       IF you have a quarter
       THEN play pac-man
       ELSE
         IF you have a $1 bill
         THEN use coin changer
         ELSE try begging

The English language statements can become comments in your final program.
The object in this design phase is the overall structure and logic of what
you want to accomplish, leaving the how to the next lower refinement.

The Ada community has settled on the obvious: why should your PDL be any
different from the programming language ==> the PDL for an Ada program
should very closely resemble Ada so that there is little translation from
the design to the implementation.  In fact, you should be able to make the
English language statements comments and/or replace them with the HOW.

My feeling is that the PDL should be rather informal and very reader 
oriented with the intent of explaining what a routine is to do in the
easiest, most understandable way without having a lot of syntax thrust
upon you.  PDL is for the human <--> the programming language is for the 
computer (I agree, too simplistic).

There are some pseudo-compilers/interpreters which will execute and
attempt to analyze PDL (ie., a logical expression is displayed and
the user is prompted for a Y/N, an arithmetic expression is prompted
for a number, and an English statement displayed as an effect - you
are attempting to symbolicly execute your design).  However, PDL
languages with the usual notion of compilers are not really applicable.

If anyone knows of any RCP/M anywhere in the U.S. that has version 1.2

Subject: Turbo free space query
Cc: info-pascal@brl.ARPA

Does anyone know of a correct algorithm for finding the amount of free space
on a drive in Turbo Pascal?  My quick and dirty algorithm below outputs the
corect results on my 128k floppies and 96k RAM disk, but errors on a hard
drive.
 
When a drive is activated in CP/M, an allocation vector is set up to determine 
the amount of free space remaining on the drive.  This vector is composed of
bits with a 0 indicating a free block and a 1 indicating an allocated block.
Calling BDOSHL(alloc_vect) puts the address of the allocation vector (for
the current selected drive) in the HL register pair.  "temp" points to the
address in memory where the allocation vector is stored.  "quotient" incre-
ments to the next consecutive 8-bit byte in the vector.  "freek" tallies up
all the 0 bits and is the value for the space remaining.
 
Would someone compile and execute this, and mail me the results?  (Be sure to
change the constant "total_k" to match your drive size.)  Or better yet,
supply me with a correct algorithm...

Does anyone know of a collection of subroutines for Turbo Pascal to do
file handling? Specifically, file look up, renaming, and deletion.
I currently need ones for CP/M but anticipate a need in the near future 
for some MS-DOS ones also. Any pointers/References appreciated.

Another consideration is the index hole, which is not going to
be in the same place if the disc is flipped over. Thus, the disc drive
must be able to cope with the index hole on the other side of the disc
center line, or discs with two center holes must be used. (has anyone ever
seen any of these?)

-Another note- the certified side of a disc is *not* the side with the
label on it. When inserting a disc into a drive with the label up,
the read/write head accesses the disc surface through the slot in
the *underside* of the disc jacket.

	Double sided disks are usually for drives with 2 heads.  The disks
still only spin in one direction.  You still face the problem of releasing
dirt trapped when spinning in the original direction.  I've been using the
flip side of single sided disks on a single head drive for several years
with no problems on either side of the disk, even though it spins both ways.

    Think we all need more information than this to go by. Do you own one ?
have you used one ?? What is wrong with it ?? Give us some details..
I own two, and am pleased, although the company is defunct, and I
purchased then at a good deal less than what they were going for new.
The only problem that I can see is Otrona put some inferior drives on
it's earlier machines, and these have caused some problems and some of the
earlier keyboards were trash. Also there isn't much software support, but most
of the MSDOS and CPM stuff will run on them.
    Lets here the gripes but back them up !!!

the only gripes I have heard about the Attache seems to be when
it is serving as an MS-DOS machine (specifics about MS-DOS problems,
I don't know, but I have heard it is just generally slow & poor in
performance...).  NO-ONE who has clarified his view to me seems to
think it is bad as a CP/M machine.

other 5 1/4 disk formats (although I know nothing about Kaypros).
Perhaps someone in the Boston area could provide me with a diskette or
someone outside the area could mail me one.  I'd pay postage and
diskette charge.  Any other help or pointers to help would be

Subject: BYE337 remote console program available

BYE337 is now available from SIMTEL20.  Here is an except from the
source code comments (a complete list of files follows):

This program allows modem callers to use a CP/M system just as if they
were seated at the system console.  Special assembly-time options al-
low limiting the caller's access by password and/or access to only a
message-service program.  A number of external inserts are available
to adapt this program to various computers, clocks and modems.  It may
be assembled with ASM, LASM, MAC or M80.  If the ZCPR3 equate is set
YES, a macro assembler such as MAC or M80 will be required.  If the
program will not assemble correctly with M80, check the insert that
was added, it likely is not configured properly.

There was a program called BYE5 that was released recently.  This is a
spin-off on BYE335 and has no advantages over the current release of
BYE.  If you have BYE5, please understand that this is newer and is
the "proper" continuation of the BYE family.  BYE3 is placed in the
public domain.  It may be updated or altered for your personal use.
I'd like to try and consolodate any new releases, so we can avoid
another MODEM7 fiasco.  If you have changes that you feel should be
included in future releases, please forward them to Saratoga OxGate
408/354-5934 (pst)

v337 - 07/24/85 - *All BYE dependant routines may be accessed through
BDOS calls now.  BYE intercepted the BDOS vector anyway, so I figured
we might as well do something with it.  BYEBDOS calls start at 80
decimal.  See BYE337.DOC for more information.  *Striped out many
comments, because I've written and included a comprehensive BYE
manual.  *Added fixes for: Anchor modems, MBBS disconnect, and
function keys generating nulls.  *Removed BYELOW equate...you MUST to
run BYE low now.  Sorry.  *If you're not using the NO25TH option, the
LCDATA buffer will be a single entry (a 0) so your BBS can sense
you're not using the NO25TH deal and not overrwrite BYE.  *Removed
manditory NO25TH when using OxGate, as OxGate's now smart enough to
sense that you don't have the buffer (see above).  *Added NEEDLC.  If
yes, then will include code to read lastcaller.  *If you have your own
modem overlay, please remove the "ANI 7FH" or "ANI 127"'s that are in
it.  This will allow 8-bit I/O for programs like XMODEM.  *Removed
low-memory bytes LHOUR/LMIN-- XModem and BBS can access them by
looking at RTCBUF+7 and RTCBUF+8 *Made the two subroutines: BCDBIN and
BINBCD deleteable.  If you need them, then set BIN2BCD and/or BCD2BIN
to "YES", otherwise they won't be assembled into the code.  *If TIMEON
is yes, you should make sure your clock insert pokes not only CHOUR
and CMIN with the binary hour/min, but that it pokes the RTCbuf with
the BCD values.  This way BBSs and XMODEM can get the time and date
from BYE.  *No longer uses STATUS byte in low-memory.  *No longer
patches punch and reader devices to modem.  -- pst

v336 - 06/28/85 - *Added call to mdhang so phone will hangup for
twit-kills.  *Fixed bug that caused BYE to randomly turn off modem
I/O.  *Removed remote user's ability to type ^T to see time on system.
(let him run a transient program)--it was too complex with fkeys.

FYI: BYE337 SUPERSEEDS BYE5.  BYE5 does not have the advanced features
	of BYE337, plus the fact that BYE337 improves upon all work
	done in BYE5.  If you have BYE5 currently on your system,
	-- PLEASE DELETE IT -- to avoid confusing users.

BYE3.ASM takes full advantage of the result codes returned by modems
using 'AT' protocol.  It uses the terse mode to recognize the speed of
the incoming signal and automatically adjusts the computer I/O to that
speed, without the user needing to type any CR's.  This is of particular
benefit for RCPM systems using the new 300/1200/2400 modems.  (For those
modems not supporting the 'AT' protocol, the caller will still need to
type enough CR characters to establish his speed.)

No external smartmodem inserts are needed, except for systems such as
the Cermetek or Pen-tel which use their own protocol.  The included
smartmodem routines also allow answering on first ring, with optional
echo-checking required by some modems for insured accuracy of command
accectance.

I have downloaded Bill Rink's PATCH18A and have found a distinct bug
in it.  I am running a N* Horizon with Bob Plouff's GENUSR front end.
Upon installing PATCH18A, I attempted to access a file and to do a
directory.  Both failed miserably - ie., PATCH is not recognizing the
directory at all.  If you have access to Bill Rink or the supplier of
the library now on SIMTEL, please let them know of this problem.  I
wonder if anyone else has had these results?  Upon getting PATCHZ80
and using it flawlessly for about 4 months now, I was most anxious to
see what the latest version had in it.  Unfortunately, it is not
working as described on my system.  Any help would be most
appreciated.  PATCH is a most useful utility and I would like to have
the latest version, if it works!

A simple way to do this is to use Mail-Merge.  If you don't have it
another approach is to use ^KB -- ^KK to mark the whole text.  Then
use ^KC repeatedly to make as many copies as you desire.  If you have
page numbering turned on put a .pn1 at the top of the block. Also, put
a .pa at the bottom to ensure that each copy starts at the beginning
of a page.

The best thing about Wordstar is if you want to do something there is usually
a way to do it.

DBL211 is now available from SIMTEL20 as:

Filename			Type	 Bytes	 CRC

Directory MICRO:<CPM.LIST>
DBL211.LBR.1			BINARY	 11392  B121H

Info from the author:

DBL.ASM was written to use the features of most of the common printers
to reduce the amount of paper used to list text files that are not
overly wide.  What it does is to print two pages at a time on a single
sheet of paper in a side by side fashion using the compressed mode of
the printer.  Sort of like:

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx   xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx   xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
.
.
.
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx   xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

     Page [ 1]             Page [ 2]

The version that I left on RCPM was set up to run on my Epson RX-80
printer, which takes the same commands as other Epson printers and the
Gemini printers as well.  The Feb 14, 1984 version has an added
feature, it can start printing in the middle of a file.

			Alan W Warren (4/09/84)

The version uploaded as DBL211.LBR is the above with the following
changes, which some may like to call enhancements:

0.  Conditional assembly for the Oki Microline 82A and 92 printers is
added, with the spacing set up so column width is 64 chars.
DBL211.COM is assembled for the Oki.  (Guess my brand of printer,
anyone?)

1.  If a line is too long to fit in the half-page column, it
is now folded onto the next line instead of being truncated.

2.  To stop print, use control-X instead of space.  I hit the space
bar too often by accident.

3.  If the text contains formfeeds, these are now acted upon in the
expected sense, namely no more text appears in that column and the
text continues at the top of the next.

Subject:   2400 baud auto-dial/auto-answer modem for $399
ReSent-From: KPETERSEN@SIMTEL20.ARPA
ReSent-To: Info-Cpm@AMSAA.ARPA
ReSent-Date: Thu 25 Jul 1985 21:33-MDT

I have spent the last 2 weeks evaluating a US Robitics Courier 2400
modem.  I have beat on it pretty severly and can't find anything wrong
with it.  We are buying several. I like it well enough that I will
probably buy myself one for home use.

The modem was used for uucp traffic on seismo for 2 weeks. It was used
for both dialins and dialing out. The ONLY problem I could find with
it is that if you try and call another site at 2400 baud and it can
only sync up at 1200, the modem prints "CONNECTED 1200" and then
resets the baudrate to the host to 1200 baud. I added 5 lines of code
to the dialer in uucp and have had no problems since. I consider this
to be minor.

Anyway, on to details. The GSA cost is $399 quantity 1. If you are not
on the GSA scale (i.e. if you don't buy as a US government agency),
you can still get it at this price by mentioning you heard about this
price from The Center for Seismic Studies (i.e. where I work). The
list price on this model is $895 and the regular non-GSA price is $479
(other dealers may charge more).

The modem operates at 300/1200/2400 baud (Bell 103/Bell212A/CCITT
V22.bis) in both originate and answer mode. It will fall back to 1200
from 2400, but not from 1200 to 300 in orignate mode and correctly
autobaud in answer mode. A nice (and undocumented feature) is that the
modem will detect what baudrate the computer is sending at and use
that as the dialout speed. This means you can just list the same modem
in your L-devices file 3 times with different speeds and not change
anything else.  [it's simpler than it sounds if you are confused]

In orignate mode, it will detect (with a serate message for each)
ringing, busy, dialtone, and voice (and hang up on a voice).

It uses a superset of the HAYES SMARTMODEM command set. I used the
unmodified Hayes driver for a while before changing it to also handle
the USR extensions. It also claims to be able to be used with
CrossTalk, SmartCom and PC-Talk communications software, but I was
unable to test this. (I presume it will work, as it looks like a
hayes)

It does pulse or tone dialing and if tone dialing doesn't get rid of
the dialtone, it will try pulse dialing.

The warranty is 2 years from US Robotics. The dealer will also handle
warranty repairs (by sending you a working one and sending yours off
to the factory.)

The 1200 baud performance was much, much better than our Racal-Vadic
MACS dialers. We were able to connect to sites with the USR modem that
we could not get to with the Vadic modem. There was very little noise
at 2400 baud and virtually none at 1200. I successfully connected at
2400 baud to ATT, Concord Data Systems, Vadic and USR 2400 baud
modems, so there is no interoperability problem. This also worked at
2400 baud on our ITT WATS lines which are much, much noiser than ATT
WATS (then again, they are also much cheaper, you get what you pay
for). I expected it to have problems with the noisy ITT lines, but it
worked perfectly. I wasn't able to give it the acid test of trying to
use Sprint, but then nothing works on Sprint reliably...

Physically, it's 6" x 10" x 1". It's a very nice, low profile modem.

The dealer is the major east cost distributer for US Robotics and has
many units in stock. We received ours within days of placing the
order.

The $399 price is ONLY available from the following dealer.  Any other
dealer will probably charge you more.

The dealer is:
	Advanced Data Products, Inc.
	18974 Bonanza Way (B-3)
	Gaithersburg, MD 20879
	(301) 424-9490
The salesmans name is:
	Don Parnell

You can probably pay for the cost of the modem in the savings in a few
months phone charges.

It sounds too good to be true, but I've got a couple in the computer
room proving they are real.

Subject: Unix Program for Converting SIMTEL20 FTP Server Filenames

Many have complained that when getting (especially "mget"ing) files to
a Unix system from the SIMTEL20 FTP server, the resulting filenames are
not what would be desired.  This problem is partially fixed by the
installation of a new FTP server that allows users to CWD (CD) to a
given directory for read access, so that the fully qualified file name
need not be sent back for each file gotten with an "mget".

However, even if you CWD to the directory before issuing an mget
command, the files will still show up with uppercase names and will
include "generation" (version) numbers.  And of course, if you fail to
CWD first, you still get the directory name too, so that you are
likely to find files with names like

<UNIX.UTIL1>CRCK2.C.1

in your Unix directory, rather than the crck2.c you might have
wanted.

A new program, XXU.C (20-to-Unix filename converter), is available in
PS:<UNIX.UTIL1> which will fix the names of all files sent to a Unix
system from a DEC-20 FTP server.  It should work on VMS and DEC-20
filenames alike -- it strips DECnet node names, device names,
directory names, generation numbers, and it lowercases the uppercase
letters.  When renaming to the name thus formed, it takes care not to
write over any existing files.  See comments in the source for further
details.

relayed to info-c and net.lang.c by the arpanet <-> usenet gateway machine,
brl-tgr.  It seems the parser was only looking at the first six characters, so
info-c looked the same as info-cpm.  I have been told that the problem has
been fixed.  If further difficulties of this nature arise, please contact
me. And thanks to the people to sent me mail concerning this problem.

    and while <UNIX> does, xxu.c isn't in it.

My appologies to all.  I left out once character in the directory

   I have a small problem which some of you may be able to help me with.  What
I am trying to do is read and write an Intertec Superbrain disk format on my
Ampro Little Board.  The current software on the Ampro doesn't support the
Intertec but I can get it to read and write that format if I know the following
paramaters:   Allocation block size (1K/2K)
              Bytes per sector
              Logical sectors per track
              Block shift factor
              Block mask
              Extent mask or data block allocation size
              Max data block number
              Max directory entries
              Directory group allocation 0
              Directory group allocation 1
              Check size
              Number of reserved tracks
              Skew table format

If any of you out there (especialy the people which own Superbrains) could
possibly get any of this information to me it would be very much appreciated.

NetLandians,

I noticed the PC and Pascal world doesn't have (or I couldn't find) a nice
little public domain hi-bit stripping program for WS and other nasty type
files.  Grabbed a handful of PD programs, some TURBTOOL procedures, and
did a little hack.

Stripper naturally strips the 8th bit (just like good old PIP with the Z
option).  Also does a tabify routine to replace all those WS DOC type file
streams of spaces with 8-space tabs.  Also grabs isolated CRs and makes them
CR/LF combinations.

Works fairly fast (didn't do any inline assembler to keep it transportable),
simple, from the command line.  Default product is FOOBAR.HAR, but you can
force any desired file name from the cmd line.  Sorry, no MS-DOS paths
(tho if someone could tell me how to do that...) but alternate disks, of
course.

Source is available via FTP from my directory, ABN.ISCAMS@USC-ISID as:
STRIPPER.PAS

I'll leave it there for a week or so.

Would appreciate feedback (especially if any bugs or failures!).

Regards,
David Kirschbaum

 Back in 1975 or 76 when true double sided disks were just new I ordered
some "two" sided disks and received what I didn't want. I got a disk
with two cutouts for both index and write protect holes presumably
certified for both sides.
  The one disturbing thing about a disk like this in my mind has to do
with the purpose of the disk cover itself. If I am not mistaken
considerable effort goes into the design of the cover to promote its
ability to clean particles off the disk media. I believe this function
is unidirectional and note that when flipped the disk will be spinning
in the opposite direction with respect to the cover.

NetLandians,

Moved down a nice little Turbo Pascal Kermit from DEC-MARLBORO.  Author
is Jeff Duncan, written in Dec 84.

Didn't hear anything on the nets about it (as I recall), so thought I'd
remind people.

Nice little package.  Not a real "full house" Kermit with all the bells and
whistles, but a real nice neat framework and the basic protocol to work from.
Much easier to hack and install than the big Assembler Kermits (believe me!),
and works just fine as is.

His package is "generic CP/M", using the Iobyte to switch ports between
Rdr/Punch and Console, but the interface is so nice and clean that it would be
fairly easy to hack in anything else you want.

Maybe some PC or MS-DOS wizard could do a hack and give us a module to handle
that environment?  Sure could use that myself, since I have friends with PC type
systems that need something, but don't have a machine handy to experiment on.

That Kermit is NOT at SIMTEL20, to the best of my knowledge, and maybe oughtta
be - sure is neat!

David Kirschbaum

Subject: SD100 super directory program available

The latest version of SD, the super directory program, is now
available from SIMTEL20 as:

Filename			Type	 Bytes	 CRC

Directory MICRO:<CPM.DIRUTL>
SD100.LBR.1			BINARY	 80640  F9AEH

SD displays the directory of a CP/M disk, sorted alphabetically, with
the file size in k, rounded to the nearest CP/M block size.  Also
displays library files with the file size in k if the '$L' option is
used.
 
Here is an excerpt from the update information:

 ======================================================================
 
  07/24/85  Rewrote the TIMEON code to allow use of the existing time-
    v100    on-system data contained in BYE5, BYE3, BYE+ or MBYE's RTC
 	    buffer.  If TIMEON is YES, SD merely reports "Time on system
 	    is nnn minutes" and makes no attempt to log the user off.
 	    Logoff responsibility is delegated to the (M)BYE(+) program.
 	    TIMEON checks to see if BYE is running and continues without
 	    reporting time-on if not.  No installation required to use
 	    this feature if you have clock code installed in your BYE.
 	    All page-1 equates previously used by TIMEON were deleted.
 
 	    This update also contains the SD99.FIX code for nested IF'
 
 					- Wayne Masters, Potpourri
 ======================================================================
 
  07/11/85  Added THREBYT equate for systems needing a 3-byte sequence
    v99     for reverse video.	If THREBYT is YES then the value coded
 	    at TBYTE is added to the reverse video sequence (currently
 	    set for a Kaypro).
 
 	    Also added a new "?" option which will display a menu
 	    of the $ options available if HELP is YES.
 
 					- Steve Sanders
 ======================================================================
 
  03/15/85  Fixes obscure display bug which deletes display of 1, 2 or
    v98     3 file names in 3 out of 4 cases when the directory has
 	    >255 entries.  The fix code was written by Peter Lyman.
 	    (See SD98.NOT).
 					- Paul Foote

 =======================================================================
 
  01/21/85  Added support for ZRDOS.  Although CP/M compatible, ZRDOS
    v97     does not allow the SWAPEM technique of poking local values
 	    into the operating system.	Instead, a test for ZRDOS is
 	    made and, if present, further calls to CPM: set the Warm
 	    Boot Trap in ZRDOS.  On any error detected by ZRDOS the
 	    trap is reset and control is passed to DSKERR:  No equates
 	    need be changed for CPM/ZRDOS, testing is dynamic in the
 	    run-time code.
 					- Joe Wright
 
 =======================================================================
 
  12/28/84  Added CP/M Plus TIMEON logic controlled by tag CPM3.  Also
 	    inserted a call to CKABRT in routine TYPE to catch an abort
 	    request (^C) sooner.
 					- George Peace
 
 =======================================================================
  Current versions of SD automatically adjust for any block size and di-
  rectory length under CP/M 1.4 or 2.x or MP/M (any version).  They also
  automatically adjust for any number of disk drives and work satisfac-
  torily even if no disk is in that drive at the moment.  Provisions are
  made for:
 
 	(1) automatic pauses when the screen fills up
 	(2) searching individual or multiple drives and/or user areas
 	(3) unconditional or optional resetting the disk system before
 	    execution begins
 	(4) directing output to a disk file called SD.DIR and appending
 	    to that file on subsequent runs
 	(5) summary line output giving drive and user information, num-
 	    ber of files matched and how much space they consume, and
 	    the amount of free space remaining on the disk
 	(6) displaying or suppressing "system" files
 	(7) accepting ambiguous filenames with or without a drive name
 	(8) printer output
 	(9) optional help menu with $?
 
 
  See SD.DOC for detailed instructions on configuring and running SD.ASM

SAP v44, the sort & pack directory program is now available from
SIMTEL20 as:

Filename			Type	 Bytes	 CRC

Directory MICRO:<CPM.DIRUTL>
SAP44.LBR.1			BINARY	 16128  073EH

THIS PROGRAM READS THE DISK DIRECTORY TRACKS, SORTS THEM
ALPHABETICALLY THEN REPLACES THEM ON THE DISK.  ALL UNUSED OR ERASED
AREAS ON THE DIRECTORY TRACK ARE REFORMATTED WITH CONTINUOUS 'E5'
CHARACTERS.  (THIS ERASES PREVIOUS FILE NAMES WHICH HAVE BEEN
DEACTIVATED.)  SORTING THE DIRECTORY IN THIS MANNER OFFERS MANY
ADVANTAGES.  SOME OF THEM ARE:

	1)  ALLOWS 'DIR' TO SHOW AN ALPHABETIZED LISTING
	2)  ELIMINATES POTENTIAL PROBLEMS WITH "UNERASE" PROGRAMS
	3)  SPEEDS UP ACCESS VIA 'SD' AND OTHER SPECIAL PROGRAMS
	4)  ASSISTS ON WORKING DIRECTLY ON THE DISK WITH 'DU', ETC.
	5)  REMOVES FILES FROM THE DISK SOMEBODY ELSE COULD RECOVER
	6)  OPTIONALLY ERASES ALL FILES OF ZERO LENGTH (EXCEPT THOSE
		STARTING WITH '-' FOR CATALOG USE WITH MAST.CAT)

Here is information about the past few updates:

07/25/85 - v44 - Added some pushes and pops so that the switch routine
will swap the entire contents of the two directory entries.
Previously it only swapped the part after it found a difference which
sometimes resulted in flag bits moving from one file to another.- Bob
Clyne

03/20/85 - v43 - Inserted my name where it belonged under the v42
release notice, added conditional assembly option for verbose mode
which will, if selected, permit the program to assemble in under 1k.
Added conditional assembly option for CP/M-only mode which suppresses
check for MP/M and CP/M+.  - Dennis Quinn

03/06/85 - v42 - Removed "trash directory" feature to make program
more user-friendly, made "delete zero-length files" an assembly-time
option, as there are more programs than MCAT which make use of
zero-length files.- Dennis Quinn (added in v43)

02/28/85 - v41 - Minor cleanup, made compatible with all assemblers. -
Irv Hoff

09/17/84 - v40 - Added 'Previously sorted' statement that was included
in v37 but got dropped from v38 when the Shell-Metnzer sort was put
in.  It still rewrites the directory even if previously sorted, to
insure erased programs at end of directory are properly cleared.- Irv
Hoff

07/27/84 - v39 - Corrected sorting of last directory entry. - WOD

10/16/83 - v38 - Now using a Shell-Metzner sort which speeds the
sorting time considerably, especially on large directories.  - Sigi
Kluger

07/27/83 -v37 - Shows an error flag for MP/M and CP/M+ both.  Rewrites
the directory even if previously sorted, to insure erased programs at
end of directory are properly cleared.  - Irv Hoff

Netlandians,

I've been working through a US Robotics Autolink 212A 300/1200 baud modem
from my micro thru a local TAC to my host on the ARPANet.  The local TAC uses
Racal Vadic 1200 baud modems, and the TAC wizards tell me it's a Bell 212
protocol modem, not the 212A.

Never thought that made a real difference, but I got problems!

During fast typing in terminal mode (right here in the editor of my mailer,
Hermes, for instance), I will suddenly get a short burst of garbage and a
lockup!  My modem lights indicate I continue to send out, but NO incoming
data.  Thought for a while the TAC modem was hanging up, but not true:
it continues to receive my commands (transmitted in the blind as it were)
and respond to them.

After much experimentation, it appears that MY USR modem is somehow losing its
incoming data!  Turning it off somewhere on the board or something.  If I very
quickly pulse the on/off switch (and am lucky enough not to have the phone
or far modem hang up on me!), I regain the incoming data channel again!

I also experience this lockup when running Kermit on my host - usually at the
exact same packet - and when doing a straight upload (using XON/XOFF flow
control at the TAC to insure I don't overflow its buffers) into a text editor.
(Sorry, during Kermit, that's during Sends to the distant Kermit only.)  So
the problem appears to be related to my modem sending somehow!

I've turned off echo at the TAC (running with local echo), and that seemed
to help a little but no guarantees - it may still lock up, but now at a
different place during the transfer.

I've experienced no such problems when dealing with other modems in the
local area, cross-country, etc.  (Of course, haven't been able to find another
Racal Vadic Bell 212 either.)

The USR Autolink 212A documentation is sketchy, to say the least!  No software
commands are documented at all (do any exist?), and only the autoanswer switch
on the back is explained.  Word length and stop bits are settable internally,
but remain at the factory default 8 bits, 2 stop bits.

Any suggestions, ideas, similar experiences?  This is bad news when I can't
upload ANYTHING anymore!  (Still works fine at 300 baud (Bell 202), but ugh.)

Thanks in advance (and sorry for the length).

Does anyone out there know how to make a Microsoft Premium Softcard
send all its output to an Apple slot?
I need to do this so I can hook up my braille display. Thanks in advance.

I   would  like  to  invite  comment  on  the  RAMDISKS  used  in 
conjunction with CP/M systems.     Please discuss the  advantages 
and  bugs  you  have found for your  system.     Currently  I  am 
interested in using MICROSHERE's Ramdisk with a Kaypro 4-84.   

Is  the  cost  of the ramdisk worthy of the  increased  speed  in 
program  execution?     Does the ramdisk make working  with  very 
large  dBase  II files faster?     What are typical time  savings 
(relative to processor speed)?

Thanks  very  much  for your attention  in  this  matter.     All 
replies will be summarized and posted to this net group.

Could somebody mail me, repost, or tell me where to get the Wordstar to
nroff filter which was posted to the net a few months ago?  I can ftp
off of any given ARPA site, like seismo, simtel20, market etc.  I also
wouldn't mind knowing how intelligent it is, that is, whether it just
flattens a Wordstar file, or whether it actually comes up with the
right nroff formatting commands.  Thanks in advance for your

Re using both sides .. I shall not address the safety of this, wear and tear,
certified sides, etc.  (That's been discussed plenty.)

However, the index holes are no problem.  I have a batch of junk disks
I experiment with.  THREE holes now!  One at about 1:00 for single-side
drives, one at about 2:00 for regular double side (yep, that's how the
drive can tell!), and one at 11:00 for flipping single-sided ones.

PS: you have to tape over the double-sided one if you want to do single-side
or flip-side on a double-side drive!  Gave me fits for a while.

As I discussed in more detail on another list, there have been some
reports of compatibility problems with the US Robotics (and other
2400 bps modems as well).  A top level modem expert I know told
me that he personally would NOT buy into 2400's at this time
unless:

1) They were REALLY cheap (like $100 he said!)
2) You were going to only be talking to the same brand of modem
   at the other end.

He said that this situation is changing but that in his opinion
he's gotten too many bad reports and knows of too many manufacturing
changes under way to want to dive in at this juncture.

Just passing this along.

Dave,

KERMIT is the one set of "public domain" files we do not keep on
SIMTEL20.  We don't keep KERMIT sources here for two reasons: we don't
have the SPACE to keep redundant copies of what is already available
via FTP from CU20B, and we wouldn't have the TIME to keep our copies
current even if we did have the space.

If anybody wishes to keep track of new developments with KERMIT,
subscribe to the weekly INFO-KERMIT-DIGEST by sending your request to
be added to the mailing list to INFO-KERMIT-REQUEST@CU20B.  Currently
under discussion are proposed major extensions to the protocol as well
as the regular announcements of new versions available and bug reports
and fixes to current versions.

    I downloaded a file from Bill Wood's board (Barstow) this AM called
    IMP240.OBJ.  It appeared to be the modified MDM740 that I was looking
    for, but when I tried to configure it with the overlay for my system,
    it stopped working.  The file was completely alone without any
    accompanying documentation, which isn't Irv's style, so I wonder if it
    was a bogus effort.  I'll try to raise Irv on CompuServe and get a
    reading.

    MEX is nice, but I need a program that isn't that complicated for the
    users I have in mind.

IMP240 is available from SIMTEL20.  Test with care.  No source code is
available and I haven't tested it.

Fellow CP/Mers - You may have noticed that mail flow in and out of AMSAA.ARPA,
the machine that handles info-cpm, has been slow lately.  The following
excerpt from the AMSAA login message explains the situation:

"Until lightning protection equipment is obtained and installed, network
service will be available only when the system is attended and provided there
is no threat of electrical storm.  This is because we must physically
"pull-the-plug" at both ends of the network cable to protect the equipment
against lightning damage."

Reply-To: "R. Meier" <rmeier@su-star.ARPA>

Seepee Emm,
	I have been using a Saturn Ramdisk 128K with my Apple ][+ for
over a year now, with no problems.  The supplied interface software is
needlessly complicated, slow and uses almost all of the Cp/m configuration
block, but despite this, I have not yet bothered to rewrite it.
	I find that I only use it about 15% of the time, but that when
I use it, it is well worth it.  I use it when I know that a given
program will have many disk references.  I typically use Wordstar,
by copying my file to the ramdisk, there editting it, and periodically
copying it back to floppy disk.  I find that the reduction in WAIT
(for disk operation) time is much more comfortable, and avoids the
problem of lost characters when a disk operation is performed while
typing.  I have found that when compiling with small c or using
the asm assembler, it is worthwhile to send the hex to the ram disk
and then load from the ram disk back onto a floppy.
	In summary,
		Saturn Ram Disk 128K
		No Problem operation > 1 yr
		Interface Software inconvenient
		Editting Speedup (x2) (mostly psychological)
		Assembly/Compiling Speedup (x2) (including copy time)

	Before, getting the new version of Kermit which does disk
buffering, I could almost double my effective file transfer rate, by
copying to ram disk.

cc: BUDDENBERGRA@USC-ISI.ARPA

                  TURBO-MODULA-II IS NEARLY HERE

     For those of you who wanted a large-program, modern,

structured language in a usable implementation, for REAL

computers (Z80 types, 8088's need not apply), there is hope.

Allow me to present the evidence.

     This past weekend, I had the priviledge of attending SOG-IV,

Dave Thompson's (MicroCornucopia) annual picnic and computerists

whing-ding.  Philippe Kahn didn't make it this year, but sent

Mike Weisert, one of Borland's programmers instead.  Mike's topic

was "Intro to Modula-II & the Borland Implementation".  After

comparing and contrasting Pascal and Modula for a while, he got

to the important points:  how Borland was building the compiler.

Selected tidbits (those that my brain retained):

     -  The compiler actually exists.  Mike had a Kaypro with the

compiler up and running.  The top menu looks (strangely) like the

Turbo-Pascal menu.  The editor is the same too.  Borland is

adhering to the Rev-3 Modula specification.

     -  Because Modula has separate compilation as part of the

compiler specification rather than part of the implementation,

the compiler compiles to disk.  Sorry, no in-RAM compilation.

The top menu also directly  calls  the  linker.
   The  demo  program  used  some
familiar modules adapted from the Turbo-tools

ACCESS.BOX package, so I expect to see them available too.

---------------------------------
  Dates weren't

mentioned, but the product demo was real enough to convince me

that this wasn't vapor.

The CPM version was the one shown.  The MS-DOS version is not

nearly as far along and Mike offered no prognostication regarding

its availability.  8088 owners...suffer!  Mike wouldn't quote a

specific price, but said "under $100".

    "fallback" of data rate making each call at a maximum (dflt 2400)
    rate, switches to a lower rate if the remote modem can't handle the
    higher.  If the USR2400 switch is set, it supports the Courier's
    adaptive dialing, automatically sets the Couriers busy detector, and
    supports "RINGING" and "VOICE" status codes.
