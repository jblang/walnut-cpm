The break signal is merely a sustained SPACE signal in the RS-232
connection.  (SPACE referring to the MARK/SPACE (1/0) distinction,
not the ascii 32 space code...)  If you have direct access to the
lines on the RS-232 port on your osborne from software, you can
create a small routine to pull this line down for a short period.

Normally the port carries a MARK signal, broken by a SPACE then
8 bits of ascii code w/ 1 or two stop bits.

I may have my usage of MARK & SPACE reversed.  It could be carrying
the SPACE normally, requiring a sustained MARK to use as BREAK.  See
your systems documentation on RS-232 port usage (if any....).

Hope this helps,

SETDRU is one method.  PUBlic files are another, one
that requires no patches to the program and uses no tpa,
but does patch the bdos. 

PUBPATCH, in the simtel20 directory of that name, is a z80
patch to an UNMODIFIED cp/m 2.2  bdos that makes a file
PUBlic when attrribute bit 2 is set in the directory.
A PUBlic file is accessible from all user numbers on
the disk.  See  our article in Dr. Dobbs' Jrnl. Oct (or Nov) 1984
for further description.

<cpm.dirutl>setdru.lbr is the file name of the program you asked for 
to let WordStar find its overlays files in other user areas.

However, I don't think that is what you *really* want.  For that,
look to <cpm.pubpatch>pubpat.lbr.  That is a BDOS patch that allows
*any* program to cross user lines for overlays. (I use it for
WordStar, dBase and SuperCalc with no problems.)

One activatives a file to be accessable in any area by setting the
high-bit of second character of the file-name.  I use NSWP for this,
the pubpat libarary has it's own program for it.  There are some
side effects but none as bad as those in setdru.  As Jerry says,
recommended.

Subject:  7000+ character tutorial on sending BREAK:

Fellow CP/Mers - In response to a recent request for information regarding
how to send BREAK from a microcomputer, here is a 7000+ character tutorial on
the subject.  Sample code is included.

     The American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII) defines a
set of 128 characters that are encoded as the various combinations of seven
bits.  When this code is used over a serial asynchronous communications link,
some additional bits are added to the seven ASCII bits to form the total
"package" that is transmitted for each character sent.

     The term "asynchronous" means that the receiver doesn't know in advance
when a character is coming.  It just sits in an "idle" state until some special
event signals the start of a new character.  This idle state is caused by the
presence of a steady logic-one signal at the receiver input, and it can last
indefinitely.  The "special event" that signals the beginning of a new
character is a transition from the idle-state logic-one signal to a logic-zero
which lasts for one bit-time, and is known as a "start-bit".

     A start-bit "wakes-up" the receiver, which then records in some sort of
memory, typically a shift-register, the states of the next seven or eight bits.
Whether seven or eight bits are recorded depends on whether "parity" is being
used.  Parity is a simple error detection scheme that, though easily deceived,
is better than nothing.  It is implemented by adding an extra bit (the eighth
bit) to the existing seven ASCII bits such that the total number of logic-one
bits in the eight-bit group is either odd or even, depending on whether "odd
parity" or "even parity" is being used.  For example, the ASCII representation
for "A" is "1000001", which has an even number of 1's.  Therefore, adding even
parity results in "01000001", which still has an even number of 1's, whereas
the odd parity representation is "11000001".

     After the start-bit and seven or eight "data-bits", the receiver expects
to see a return to the logic-one state to signify the end of the character.
This logic-one state lasts for at least one bit-time, and is known as a
"stop-bit" (or bits).  Typically, one stop-bit is used for all speeds greater
than 110 baud, and two stop-bits are used at 110 baud and below.  This
convention derives from the mechanical roots of teleprinting, where the
electro-mechanical devices used to decode and print the received characters
needed time to stop quivering after each character before being ready to decode
and print the next.

     To summarize then, an ASCII character sent via an asynchronous serial
channel consists of one start-bit, seven or eight data-bits (depending on
whether parity is being used), and one or two stop-bits (depending on the
speed of transmission).  This brings us (at last) to the BREAK signal.

     The BREAK signal has its roots at least as far back as the days of
mechanical teleprinters, perhaps all the way back to electro-mechanical
telegraphy.  Early teleprinters used an electro-mechanical device called a
"selector" to perform the decoding function now done electronically by devices
such as the Universal Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter (UART).  The start-bit
caused a current flowing in the selector electro-magnet to cease, thereby
releasing a clutch that set into motion a complex mechanical process that
resulted in the printing of the received character.  This process made a
considerable noise, even when a non-printing character such as a space was
received.  If a steady logic-zero signal (no current in the selector magnet)
was presented to the receiving teleprinter, the machine emitted a steady
rhythmic clunking that was impossible to ignore.  Consequently, the machines
had a key labeled BREAK that merely opened the series DC circuit connecting
all transmitters and receivers in the teleprinter network, thereby getting the
attention of all operators.  There was also a BELL character, but this had to
be correctly decoded by a receiver in order to ring the bell, whereas the
BREAK was a "non-character" that could be used to interrupt a transmission-
in-progress, since it simply disrupted the whole network and made a lot of
noise at each receiving teleprinter.

     Today, the BREAK signal performs a similar function in a similar manner.
It is used now most often to gain the attention of a computer or other
machine, rather than to alert a human operator.  But it is still generated by
sending a logic-zero signal of indeterminate length, although by convention
some specific durations (typically in the 300 - 500 millisecond range) have
been adopted.  Modern electronic receiving circuits such as those whose names
end with "ART" (as in UART) interpret the beginning of the BREAK as a start-bit
followed by seven or eight logic-zero data-bits (the ASCII NUL character).  But
the expected stop-bit (return to logic-one state) is missing.  This causes the
receiving circuit to generate an error condition called "framing error", which
is typically signaled by the setting of an error-bit in the status register
of the receiving device.  How the "user machine" responds to this condition is
determined by the user-machine's software.

     The example to follow shows how a BREAK can be sent via software control
of a 1602 UART.  This device, which is typical of many such devices, has a
command instruction that forces the output to a logic-zero state until the
complementary instruction is issued.  The code is taken from my MODEM7 overlay
for the TRS-80 Model-I computer.  All code not needed for this specific
example has been deleted.

Note that the particular control-bytes needed to program the 1602 UART were
determined from the 1602 data sheet.  It is pointless to attempt writing this
kind of code unless you have access to this kind of information.  Many readers
of info-cpm can help in this regard.

     Many other examples can be found in the overlay files on SIMTEL20 in
directories PD:<CPM.MODEM7> and PD:<CPM.MEX>, available via FTP with login
username "anonymous" and password "ftp" (or any other printing string).

Subject: SB180 help


I have purchased a SB180 board and have wired it into a power supply
and installed two Tandon TM-65-2 48 tpi 5-1/4" DSDD drives (80 tracks
per drive, unformatted 500K bytes maximum storage).  These
drives do not support the READY line, so I have installed the JP 6
jumper on the SB180, which makes the disk controller think the disk
drives are always ready.  The ROM monitor on the SB180, when it see's
that the drives are ready, assumes that the user wants to autoboot from
the floppy.  When I try to boot the ZRDOS operating system, I get
the operating system sign-on for version 2.1 of ZRDOS.
According to the manual, this indicates that ZRDOS has
been correctly loaded into memory.  I then get the message

     Read Error on A:

     I have installed a switch as part of my JP 6 jumper, so I can make
the monitor think that the floppies are not ready and thus enter the
command entry state.  From the monitor, I have not been able to format
floppies.  The program disappears for a time and then aborts with a
dump of the disk controller status registers and the head, track, and
sector in which the format dies.  Using the monitor R command, I am
able to read sectors from the operating system diskette.  When I go
beyond sector 9 with the read, I get the same disk controller status
register dump.

     The Tandon drives do not support the Head Load line in the
interface.  This is pin 4 and is listed as a spare for the floppy.
The SB180 manual alludes to the fact that Head Load is not required
but is desirable to extend the life of the diskettes.  Is this line
required?  Is there any way to make the Tandon drives support the
READY line (pin 34)?  The Tandon manual alludes to this line being
optionally enabled, but does not tell how.  There is no jumper
documented.

     Has anyone else tried to interface this type of drive to the
SB180?  If so, please provide any hints or insights.  Any other SB180
ideas??

Thanks in advance.

Re PUBPATCH in finding WS overlays..

PUBPATCH will look to "root" disk same user, then "root" disk user 0, for
.COM files but will NOT find overlays!  (Had this problem with WS,
Turbo Pascal, others.)  Also, while within WS, you can't RUN programs
not in your immediate user area because WS doesn't seem to use the BDOS
calls to find files.  So PUBPATCH won't be of much help in this case.

I ended up keeping one copy of WS.COM in my "root" disk, A0, along with
"original" copies of the required overlays.  Then used DUPUSR (another
public domain program .. copies a directory entry to another user area
but NOT the program, saving MUCH disk space) to copy overlay file names
to all required user areas.  STATed them protected and invisible so the
names wouldn't be in the way.  Could then run WS from any disk any user,
with NO increased disk usage.

Worked fine, did the same with Turbo Pascal and a couple other programs
that had associated data files.

Yep, there is a WS patch program in the SIMTEL20 archives, and I think
it IS named SETDRU.COM.  Patches WS directly, as I recall, so WS is then smart
enough to find its overlays at a selected "root" disk/user.  A little more
elegant than my DUPUSR kludge, but then I'd used DUPUSR for other things
and kind of got in a rut.

There is some code on [the fine] Royal Oak BBS (ergo SIMTEL20) called
CCPPATCH.ASM.  It's purpose in life is similar to that of the Wordstar
user-number hoppers that have been discussed of late, only it's more
generic - instead of user numbers it works with drives.  For example,
if I try to fire up an image on C: and it's not there, CCPPATCH makes
the system look on A: before it errors-out on you.

My problem is - what do you build it with and/or does it work ?  I
blindly threw it at ASM, but ASM wasn't fond of it - undefined labels.
I dunno - maybe those are Z80 ops.  Basically, I want a tool to do this

Hardly undocumented, since it says so right in the article. Yet why consider

to buy compoilers (such as FORTRAN & COBOL) written for the Heath

since the Zenith product was cheaper.  Trouble is, I can't find

I haven't used there RAM disk board, but have used other boards from
them S-100 static RAM and ROM boards all with no problems, these boards
seemed well designed and the PWB was of good quality. The instructions
were good(I built mine from the bare boards)

PS: Digital Research Computers brought out a single board computer
called "Big Board", Xerox later based the 820 on this design.

Fellow CP/Mers - In response to a recent request for information regarding
how to send BREAK from a microcomputer, here is a 7000+ character tutorial on
the subject.  Sample code is included.

     The American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII) defines a
set of 128 characters that are encoded as the various combinations of seven
bits.  When this code is used over a serial asynchronous communications link,
some additional bits are added to the seven ASCII bits to form the total
"package" that is transmitted for each character sent.

     The term "asynchronous" means that the receiver doesn't know in advance
when a character is coming.  It just sits in an "idle" state until some special
event signals the start of a new character.  This idle state is caused by the
presence of a steady logic-one signal at the receiver input, and it can last
indefinitely.  The "special event" that signals the beginning of a new
character is a transition from the idle-state logic-one signal to a logic-zero
which lasts for one bit-time, and is known as a "start-bit".

     A start-bit "wakes-up" the receiver, which then records in some sort of
memory, typically a shift-register, the states of the next seven or eight bits.
Whether seven or eight bits are recorded depends on whether "parity" is being
used.  Parity is a simple error detection scheme that, though easily deceived,
is better than nothing.  It is implemented by adding an extra bit (the eighth
bit) to the existing seven ASCII bits such that the total number of logic-one
bits in the eight-bit group is either odd or even, depending on whether "odd
parity" or "even parity" is being used.  For example, the ASCII representation
for "A" is "1000001", which has an even number of 1's.  Therefore, adding even
parity results in "01000001", which still has an even number of 1's, whereas
the odd parity representation is "11000001".

     After the start-bit and seven or eight "data-bits", the receiver expects
to see a return to the logic-one state to signify the end of the character.
This logic-one state lasts for at least one bit-time, and is known as a
"stop-bit" (or bits).  Typically, one stop-bit is used for all speeds greater
than 110 baud, and two stop-bits are used at 110 baud and below.  This
convention derives from the mechanical roots of teleprinting, where the
electro-mechanical devices used to decode and print the received characters
needed time to stop quivering after each character before being ready to decode
and print the next.

     To summarize then, an ASCII character sent via an asynchronous serial
channel consists of one start-bit, seven or eight data-bits (depending on
whether parity is being used), and one or two stop-bits (depending on the
speed of transmission).  This brings us (at last) to the BREAK signal.

     The BREAK signal has its roots at least as far back as the days of
mechanical teleprinters, perhaps all the way back to electro-mechanical
telegraphy.  Early teleprinters used an electro-mechanical device called a
"selector" to perform the decoding function now done electronically by devices
such as the Universal Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter (UART).  The start-bit
caused a current flowing in the selector electro-magnet to cease, thereby
releasing a clutch that set into motion a complex mechanical process that
resulted in the printing of the received character.  This process made a
considerable noise, even when a non-printing character such as a space was
received.  If a steady logic-zero signal (no current in the selector magnet)
was presented to the receiving teleprinter, the machine emitted a steady
rhythmic clunking that was impossible to ignore.  Consequently, the machines
had a key labeled BREAK that merely opened the series DC circuit connecting
all transmitters and receivers in the teleprinter network, thereby getting the
attention of all operators.  There was also a BELL character, but this had to
be correctly decoded by a receiver in order to ring the bell, whereas the
BREAK was a "non-character" that could be used to interrupt a transmission-
in-progress, since it simply disrupted the whole network and made a lot of
noise at each receiving teleprinter.

     Today, the BREAK signal performs a similar function in a similar manner.
It is used now most often to gain the attention of a computer or other
machine, rather than to alert a human operator.  But it is still generated by
sending a logic-zero signal of indeterminate length, although by convention
some specific durations (typically in the 300 - 500 millisecond range) have
been adopted.  Modern electronic receiving circuits such as those whose names
end with "ART" (as in UART) interpret the beginning of the BREAK as a start-bit
followed by seven or eight logic-zero data-bits (the ASCII NUL character).  But
the expected stop-bit (return to logic-one state) is missing.  This causes the
receiving circuit to generate an error condition called "framing error", which
is typically signaled by the setting of an error-bit in the status register
of the receiving device.  How the "user machine" responds to this condition is
determined by the user-machine's software.

     The example to follow shows how a BREAK can be sent via software control
of a 1602 UART.  This device, which is typical of many such devices, has a
command instruction that forces the output to a logic-zero state until the
complementary instruction is issued.  The code is taken from my MODEM7 overlay
for the TRS-80 Model-I computer.  All code not needed for this specific
example has been deleted.

		OUT	CONTROLP	;to turn off break.
		POP	H		;Restore double registers.
		POP	D		;

Note that the particular control-bytes needed to program the 1602 UART were
determined from the 1602 data sheet.  It is pointless to attempt writing this
kind of code unless you have access to this kind of information.  Many readers
of info-cpm can help in this regard.

     Many other examples can be found in the overlay files on SIMTEL20 in
directories PD:<CPM.MODEM7> and PD:<CPM.MEX>, available via FTP with login
username "anonymous" and password "ftp" (or any other printing string).

David,
Maybe your BDOS is not standard ....

i.e. I do exactly what you say doesn't work - I have WS.COM, WSOVLY.COM and
WSMSGS.ORVR in user 0 disk A.  Now, any disk, any user can type 'WS' and
expect to get WordStar (running the ZCPR2 patches also.)  The 'r' command
of WordStar doesn't work as you stated unless the target program is also
marked public.  Note that the WS internal search for overlay must have
the proper drive where the overlays are located (label DEFDSK)

I used to use the DUPUSR kludge but got burned by it from (my) carelessness.
pubpatch is more 'elegant'.

(All of this on a NorthStar Horizon w/352k running TSS/C, a multi-user
CP/M system using one Z80 and bankswitching.  [yes, it *is* slow at times!])

What exactly is an unwanted ad?

Is it a For Sale ad, or is it a request for the latest version of MODEM ?
Is it and ad that implies exchange of cash, or exchange of floppies?

Is this group therefore just for technical info, and not a place to
connect with other users?

It seems silly to forbid most ads for personal entities ( not commmercial 
entities ) because they mostly involve give and take between legitimately
interested parties. The primary assumption of the "personal" ad here is that
the ad will be used on one occasion, e.g. to get rid of your cpm system.
Abuses therefore include only those people who try to get rid of more than
a few of an item ( "I've got 300,000 cpm systems to get rid of and a special
rate for net people" ).  

the whole point of using the net is that it allows you to interact with people
with a common interest. If you take out the common interest variable by
placing the ad in a general-purpose mailing group, then you defeat this
purpose. 

Ads that did not relate to cpm *would* be objectionable.

Eric - Since I started the discussion, I'd like to reply to your comments.

There were several reasons for the establishment of the ARPANET.  First, and
foremost, was to develop the concept of packet switching.  Once you could do
that, it seemed that a logical use was to foster communications of technical
issues between interested parties.  Requests for help in bringing-up the 
latest version of a package (proprietary or public domain) is valid.  Comments
on the use of a proprietary object (software, hardware) are valid, as well, in
my opinion, the experiences had with a commercial vendor (I have had a bad 
experience with XYZ, Inc).  All of these topics allow for the passing of 
information between interested parties.  I, for one, would like to know that
if you buy a product from XYZ for either employment/research or 
personal-related work, the kind of support you might get from the vendor.

The ARPANET was not intended for use as an advertising medium for either
commercial concerns or individuals to sell goods and/or services.  

My comments are based on the idea that ARPANET is a DoD-funded activity, not
funded and supported by the private sector.  The above comments are strictly
personal and do not reflect those of either my employer, DoD or any other
government agency.

This may sound silly, but TURBO PASCAL is available for the C64 CPM
option.
In fact TURBO-PASCAL is the only product ever offered for the C64 CPM
option.(on the Commodore disk format)

TURBO comes with a screen editor that mimics WS in the non-document
mode.
The editor works well and is fast. It is limited to files that can fit
in memory.

For what it's worth...

I concur with Jeff's comments on inappropriateness of private or any
other ads on the ARPANet.  (I'm sure DoD is vastly reassured and encouraged
by that.)

But I would hate to lose the ties/links with those other nets that work
with us on the ARPANet who DO permit these adds.  Regrettably, some people's
distribution schemas will shoot ads across to us .. a good application for
AI maybe?  To filter them out?  Any messages with "FOR SALE", "CHEAP",
"SUCH A DEAL"?

	Minor correction to your very good lesson on asynch for those who
	believe the world started with the microcomputer:  The convention as
	I have always heard it is to default to 2 stop bits for baud rates
	150 and below, not 110 and below.  In field test versions of some DEC
	operating system (I think RSX, but am not sure), they also originally
	had 110 and changed it to 150 when I reported it to them.
	
     Thanks, Richard.  Anybody know what hardware was originally responsible
for the use of 150 baud?  110 baud was derived from a nominal rate of 10
characters-per-second, with 11 bits (one start, eight data and two stop) per
character (10 x 11 = 110).  150 baud appears to be based on 15 characters-per-
second with 10 bits (only one stop-bit) per character.  Who made the first 15
cps printer?

>> Anybody know what hardware was originally responsible for the

The first major printer at 150 baud  (maybe the first of all, I don't know)
was the Teletype model 37.  Its mechanism was a lot like the model 35,
but with a bigger type basket. It was Teletype's first
machine with lower case letters.  We used them on some of the early PDP-10
processors as consoles. [We = DEC engineering of about 1969.]

And the person who corrected the tutorial by saying that 150 baud
machines used two stop bits was wrong. The model 37 used one stop bit.

I think the 37 was the only machine I ever saw that was fully mechanical
at that speed. That is, the "UART" function (serial <--> parallel
conversion) was mechanical, not electronic.  It rattled its little heart
out at a good clip, but couldn't really stand up to the effort. They didn't
last long before wearing themselves out and dying.

Must strongly disagree with the statement that Model 37's wear
out fast.  I have one (currently in storage) that was the ONLY printer
on my home system(s) for over 3 years, often printing large assembly
listings lasting over 6 hours.  As long as you gave them an annual oil
change and lube, they will last almost indefinately.  The one I have
is set for 10 pitch, although I understand some were 12-pitch, and
printed only 69 characters before inducing an automatic line feed.
   The 150 bps speed appears to be an early effort into the standard
rates governed by the "75 times 2 to the nth" rule comprised of 75, 150,
300, 600, 1200...etc bit rates.
   One quirk on some Model 37s is that many had the MIL-STD-188C inter-
faces which use a POSITIVE voltage for a logical "1" whereas RS-232 uses
a NEGATIVE voltage for a logical "1".  This means that an extra inverter
is required when driving the device from commonly available interfaces.

                        SCAN Version 1.00

SCAN, based on the program BISHOW, is a program to view text and 
squeezed text files.   It can be used to take quick looks at files 
without unsqueezing them or loading a large text editor, or to 
examine another file with the RUN command while in Wordstar. 
You can display the file in either direction, search for
strings, or view only selected columns of the file.  In function, it
is identical to BISHOW Version 1.11 with two major additions  the
search function, and the ability to bishow a squeezed file.  The
program is written for Z80's only, and the addition of the unsqueezing
routines has ballooned the program to just under 4K.  The various
commands for SCAN are:

     1)   Display the Next Page (Forward a Page) 
     2)   Display the Previous Page (Back a Page)
     3)   Display the Next Line (Next Line)
     4)   Display the Previous Line (Back a Line)
     5)   Display the First Page (Top of File)
     6)   Display the Last Page (End of File)
     7)   Quit (End SCAN)
     8)   Set Screen Parameters
     9)   Search for a String of Characters
          Searching includes wild card characters, forward and
          backward search, and option to ignore upper/lower case.
    10)   Display Help

As distributed, SCAN contains a small patch file (SCANPAT.ASM). 
This allow changing the various default parameters, as well as 
the commands and terminal characteristics.  Look at this file for 
information about modifying SCAN.  The distributed version of 
SCAN is configured for the standard command names and a "plain 
vanilla" CRT.  This should work for most terminals.

If you are interested in the program, please E-mail me a message.
If there is enough interest, I will distribute it via net.sources,
otherwise I'll E-mail it back to you.  The normal distribution package
includes SCAN.DOC, SCANPAT.ASM, AND SCAN.HEX.  The sources is written
in Zilog mnemonics and is not being distributed at this time.

No, I don't think that is silly at all.
My main reason for wanting the editor is to avoid using ED to create and edit .ASM files.
Does the editor with TURBO support .ASM and .TXT file type?
I also got a copy of VDO.hex that Keith Petersen was nice enough to send me
and I am going to try that out too.
Have to dig out that program that lets you xfer files from C64 DOS<=>C64 CP/M.

What does Turbo Pascal for the C64 CP/M cost?
Thanks in advance.

I have dealt with Digital Research Computers (of Texas) a couple of times
and had good results. The lab where I worked bought a bunch of their ZRT-80
boards to upgrade some otherwise scrap terminals. The only difficulty was 
in teaching them to handle a P.O. (they wanted to know how to "cash" it)
The boards worked fine on power-up so I can't say how they would handle a
service call. 

As for the RAM disk I keep seeing it and wondering if I should risk it. If
you do get one please post your experiences with it to the net.

    If you're talking about the MD-11 system from MORROW, there is a
phone number for their California office (415) 430-1970.  I called
recently since I'm having trouble with my hard disk.  For the Boston
area the nearest official Morrow service place is near Nashua NH.
They're Computer Data Services (or Systematic Solutions) (603) 673-7375
The Meeting Place Mall, Amherst, NH 03031.  They might be able to help

I had my C64 replaced with a new one about a month ago.  I didn't see
any new changes in the new C64 but I guess there is since my C64 CP/M
doesn't work now.  Does anyone know why?  I bought it in Nov. 83.  Of
course I might be stuck with it now, worst is that I can't run CP/M on
my c64 now.

I don't know about their RAM boards, but their ZRT-80 board is pretty good.
I don't know if the same person that designed the ZRT-80 (Bill White) did
the RAM boards or not.  But, if so, the RAM boards are probably pretty solid.

I have built three ZRT-80's from kits.  It's not a problem for someone
who has built similar boards before, but the manuals are definitely not
in the same category as those from Heathkit.  The instructions for the
ZRT-80 kit are three pages long.

One of the things I like about dealing with DRC is that, in the case of the
ZRT-80 board, they make the software source code available on a disk for
a reasonable price.  Also, the manual includes a nice writeup on how to
use it and how it works.

My only beef is that they always quote 2 weeks delivery, and they mean it.
I don't know if they sit on the orders for two weeks or if they are always
two weeks behind, but they deinitely do not ship your order the next day.
(maybe they are just very organized?)

If DRC had something that I wanted I would definitely give them an order.

Although I have not checked it out, I assume that the overlays for the
MEX (and perhaps a few other ) modem program(s) for the O1 have the
assembly code for implementing a "break" using the uart chip in the O1.

These overlays can be found in the simtel20 archives:  micro:<cpm.mex>.

Initial Performance:

No errors during 10 hours at 2400 bps from home (1 crow mile from UofW) 
into some 2400 bps modem (make unknown) attached to Sytek network at 
UofW.  No errors when using the Courier to dial out from MATH into the 
Sytek at 2400bps and then logging back into MATH again. Many errors on 
MATH end during two of several 1200 bps calls into WATMATH ttyd0 
(Gandalf/Cermetek SAM 212A modem).  The errors were always BREAK 
followed by a "{".  Unlike the Hayes 1200 modem I normally use, taking 
an extension phone off the hook at 1200bps made the MATH errors much 
worse rather than better.  (The Hayes 1200 is virtually error-free with 
the phone off the hook at 1200bps.)  Calling in to MATH and ROSE modems 
(Gandalf/Cermetek SAM 212A modems) produced lots and lots of noise when 
I tried calling out and back in using the Courier at 1200bps.  Using 
the Courier to call in to WATCGL, WATDAISY, and WATMUM (Vadic 3451 
modems) showed no noise.  As I said, at 2400bps, calling out from MATH 
into the unknown 2400 bps modem using the Courier showed no noise at 
all.

UUCP

Our byte rate to ihnp4 in Chigago is usually about 70-90 bytes/sec at 
1200 bps; using the 2400 bps Courier changed that up to about 145 
bytes/sec. Looking at the amount of illumination of the send/receive 
data LEDs, I get the feeling that the limiting factor is still the load 
on ihnp4, not the speed or quality of the line or modem.  ihnp4 would 
not respond for long periods of time; this would often cause our end to 
time out.  I babysat the modem and kept calling back whenever this 
happened. ihnp4 has an ARK 2400 bps modem inbound, and uses a Concord 
outbound.

In town here, we do a maximum of 110 bytes/sec at 1200 bps; using the 
Courier upped that to about 215 bytes/sec.  If they ever start charging 
for local calls, the higher speed will be useful.

Calling utzoo in Toronto, our 1200 bps byte rate is about 109 
bytes/sec.  I tried to use the Courier into their 2400 bps modems (they 
have a Racal-Vadic 2400PA), but the noise on the line usually prevented 
the login from succeeding.  In the rare cases where it did succeed, the 
error rate was so high that the byte rate was only 24 bytes/sec, with 
so many timeouts that the overall rate was less than half that.  1200 
bps on the same line, a UofW FX Toronto line, worked just fine.  I 
tried avoiding the FX line and just dialling long distance and got 
about the same error rate, so I don't think it's the FX line that's 
awful.  (After all, we call ihnp4 at 1200 and 2400 bps using the same 
set-up with much better results.)

I put the Courier onto its own dedicated phone line, getting it off the 
UofW SL-1 extension altogether, and called utzoo again.  Byte rate went 
up to 150 bytes/sec, provided I could get logged in.  Still lots of 
noise on the line.

I called linus (Boston), who have Concord Data 2400 bps modems, and 
noticed no noise on the line during the brief call there.  I sent them 
/etc/termcap (74355 bytes) and got a byte rate of 210 bytes/sec. (Very 
Nice!)  I called utai (Toronto) briefly, and noticed no noise there 
either.  (No uucp account, so I couldn't send anything.)

To sum up: it seems the University's SL-1 switch might be damaging 
communications a bit.  Regardless of that, the Courier just doesn't 
like talking to the Vadic at utzoo at 2400 bps no matter what line I 
use.  The Courier calls all four other 2400 bps modems I know of okay.  
henry@utzoo says their 2400 bps calls to linus average over 200 
bytes/sec both ways; we seem to do the same to linus, but can't talk to 
utzoo.  Just shows that things that can talk to the same thing can't 
necessarily talk to each other!

Observed Quirks with this modem:

If you are connected to something at 2400bps, you use +++ to get back 
to the command mode, you display and *interrupt* a HELP menu, then go 
back on line, you get lots of repeating junk on your screen.  You have 
to use +++ to go off-line again, display a HELP menu *without 
interruption*, then go back on line.  If you try the same thing at 
1200bps, you get *no* junk if you interrupt the HELP menu and go back 
on line, and you get the repeating junk if you let it finish and go 
back on line!  At 1200 bps, I had the modem hang three times when this 
junk started appearing.  When the junk is printing, the Receive Data 
light is flashing madly and pulling out the phone cord gives an 
immediate NO CARRIER.  When the modem hung, the RD light went out, the 
SD light would flash when characters were typed, but nothing appeared 
on the screen and +++ and AT had no effect.  Pulling out the phone cord 
did not affect the hung modem; it just did not respond to anything and 
I had to power down every time.  Looks like you'd better not need any 
on-line help screens in the middle of a session.

We took the modem to a country exchange, long distance to UofW, and saw 
the same sort of junk appear when we tried calling the unknown 2400 bps 
modem at UofW.  The 2400 would answer, signal 2400 bps, and the Courier 
would respond with CONNECT 1200 (!?) and then lots of incessant junk.  
We usually had to power off the modem to get it back.  The incessant 
junk looked the same as the junk that kept spewing out in the above-
mentioned help-menu bug.  It's almost as if the answering modem were 
sending a 2400 bps carrier that the Courier was mis-interpreting at 
1200 bps, resulting in a continuous stream of junk. Actually using the 
Courier to call out at 1200 bps on the same country line worked just 
fine.

Nothing I tried could get the modem to recognize my VOICE in the 
extended result code set.  I set parameter X6 and phoned from my home 
line to my data line and answered the phone myself - the Courier said 
RINGING and then eventually NO CARRIER, no matter what I said into the 
phone. A friend tried the same thing and yelled a few times into the 
phone, and it recognized his voice as VOICE.

I picked up my extension phone, dialed a '5' to get rid of the dial 
tone, and then told the Courier to dial a number on the same line.  If 
I said nothing, it would correctly detect NO DIAL TONE.  If I talked 
while it came off-hook, it would usually mistake my voice for a dial 
tone, dial the number into my voice, and then say either BUSY or 
RINGING followed eventually by NO CARRIER.

Register S10 (timer for loss of carrier) claims to be scaled in tenth-
seconds, but setting it to 254 and unplugging the telephone cable 
causes carrier loss after only a second or two, not 25 seconds. Setting 
S10 to 255 and unplugging the cable hangs the modem.  It gets stuck 
off-hook with the CD light on, and refuses to respond to anything 
except power-off, even with the cable plugged in again.

The manual says you can type the command set in upper or lower case. 
What it doesn't say is that both letters of the AT prefix must be the 
*same* case -- "AT" and "at" work; "aT" and "At" do not.

"A/" repeats the last command, and the last command is cleared the 
instant the letters AT appear, so if you intended to repeat the last 
command but type AT followed by backspace followed by /, it's too late.  
Backspace only deletes command chars, not the prefix itself. This is a 
"feature" of Hayes modems, too.

The "guard band" register (S12) behaves a bit non-intuitively when set 
to small values.  Not only does the guard band decrease, but the length 
of time in which you have to type all three "+"s goes down too!  At 
small settings, you have to use the repeat key to get it fast enough. 
At the smallest settings, I think you're required to type the "+"s 
faster than the baud rate will allow...

Summary:

I could have put up with the help-menu problem if I hadn't also tripped 
over similar junk when using the modem in the country.  Looks like the 
modem's state transition diagram has a loophole.  UofW needs a modem 
that can talk 2400 bps to utzoo in Toronto, ideally using the cheap FX 
line through the UofW SL-1 exchange, and this one can't do that very 
well.  (In fact the ratio of line costs, FX versus using DDD on a 
private line, is almost exactly the ratio of byte rates, meaning we 
save no money going to 2400 bps on the DDD line instead of using 1200 
bps on the FX line.)

WATFOR stands for WATerlooFORtran and is an interactive Fortran interputer.
It was developed by Waterloo University in Canada.

The first machine to use it was the Commadore 9000 (Super PET).
I don't know if ever was made available for any other machines.

David:

To the best of my knowledge there is nothing unique about .ASM and .TXT
files, that is they are sequential ASCII text files. Using the
TURBO-PASCAL etitor you can give a file any name and extension that is a
legal CP/M file name. Thus you should be able te create and edit .ASM
and .TXT files with out any problems. In fact the TURBO editor can make
a file of the type NAME.COM but CP/M won't like it! The only restriction
is the file size is <62K (the manual says 64K) and the file must fit in
available memory, thus on CP/M 80 systems the file size will be much
less than 62K by the size of TURBO and the resident CP/M RAM space.

When you do a save from the TURBO editor the existing file NAME.EXT is
renamed NAME.BAK and a new NAME.EXT file is created.

Hi,

Recently, I have started programming on an IBM PC, and have the following
problem:

I have a Compupro/Viasyn 816 at home, which is an S-100 machine. For my work, 
I need an IBM PC compatible system.

I know that I can buy a PC board, more memory and a hard disk for my system,
but the price tag is too high. So, what I'd like to find out is:

1- Is there a cheaper way to convert a Compupro into an IBM PC compatible machine?
2- Is it possible to trade in or exchange my sytem for a PC or a compatible?
3- If possible, what steps should I take to sell my system?

I need to resolve this issue as quickly as possible, so please, any info will
be greatly appreciated.

	Thanks in advance,
	Jack Bicer

WATFOR was NOT first implemented on the SuperPET. It's immediate successor,
WATFIV, is mentioned in the 1979 edition of the dragon book (Aho and
Ullman), so WATFOR was around a long time before SuperPET. The version I am
aware of was available on IBM mainframes and was not an interpreter;  it was
a very fast compiler optimized for handling multiple compiles submitted in a
batch.  It was specially designed for student use, concentrating on quick
compile and good error checking rather than optimized object code.

I used WATFOR/WATFIV back in '72 on U of Mich's IBM 360/67.  Presumably that
predates the "Commadore 9000 (Super PET)."

Steven:

There was a very good article that included this in the June 85 Dr.
Dobbs Journal. The article title is "Christensen Protocols in C" by
Donald Krantz.
The article starts on P66 and there is a special section on CRC on p.68.
This CRC is based on the CCITT polynomial X^16+X^12+X^5+1 (Someone must
know what that means). 

The Source Code in C for the entire XFR communications package can be
downloaded from the TCOG BBS (612) 724-7779 @300/1200 baud

Perhaps this article and code can help you with a KERMIT version of CRC.

WATFOR77 is available for PC-DOS from:
        WATCOM Products Inc
        415 Phillip Street
        Waterloo, Ontario, Canada
        N2L 3X2
        (519) 886-3700
        Telex 06-955 458
It is available for other systems, too (e.g. IBM VM/CMS), but I don't
think it runs under CP/M.  It supports the full FORTRAN 77 standard.
Your daugther may be using WATFOR on a DEC mini in which case I believe
it would be a FORTRAN 66 compiler (from the same people).  (btw WATCOM
Products markets software developed by the WATCOM Group, as well as
software developed at the University of Waterloo - where I am employed.)

Warning:  I just implemented CRC from this article, and it is vague in
one serious point:  It says simply that the CRC is generated by running "each
byte of the packet" through the generator.  In Christensen protocol, this 
would normally include the header info, as when calculating checksum, but
(at least in Christensen) for CRC you only want the actual data bytes to
be CRC'd.

Note:  Your mileage may differ.

Someone recently asked for CRC code in C but I've forgotten
who.  So here it is again.

From: harpo!floyd!clyde!burl!hou3c!hocda!machaids!djj at ucb-vax

About a month ago I put a  request  for  CRC  (Cyclic  Redundancy
Codes)  information  on this net.  I received in a number of good
programs and comments, and several requests to forward whatever I
discovered.   Since  I have not been able send mail to several of
the people who made requests, I'll put this summary on the net.

It appears that CRC calculations are based on a  polynomial  that
is  not standardized, so it is possible to have several different
valid CRC values for the same  file  simply  by  using  different
polynomials.   There  is  an article in the June 83 issue of IEEE
Micro which gives a little background on CRC and on a method  for
calculating  same.   Unfortunately,  the  examples  are  given in
assembler.

One of the C programs I received, and modified slightly  produces
CRC  values  identical to those produced by CRCK.COM and "uc" the
UNIX/CPM communications  program  that  is  intended  to  replace
"umodem".  Here is the source code ---- "crck.c" (118 lines;  493
words; 2874 bytes):
/*
 *			----	crck.c    ----
 *
 *			Version 1.0  -  4/9/83
 *
 *	This UN*X program performs a file hashsum calculation consistent
 *	with the de facto standard (but misnamed) "CRCK" program for CP/M.
 *
 *	Usage: crck [-w] filename...
 *
 *		The -w flag suppresses the warning message that normally
 *		is printed when a file is found not to be a multiple of
 *		128 bytes in size.  (Such a file cannot be a faithful copy
 *		of a CP/M file, since CP/M files are always a multiple of
 *		128 bytes).
 *
 *	Notes:
 *		1. Two versions of the CRCK program exist in the CP/M
 *		world. Variants of Keith Petersen's original program
 *		are the de facto standard, even though they misuse the
 *		underlying CRC calculation subroutine and therefore don't
 *		really perform a "CRC" function.  This program produces
 *		hashsums consistent with Petersen's scheme, currently
 *		found in the "CRCK4x.ASM" series.
 *
 *		2. In order for valid comparisons to be made between the
 *		CP/M and UNIX copies of a file, the file must, of course,
 *		have been transferred intact; i.e., with the "-rb" option
 *		of umodem, or the "-b" option of rb.

Subject: SB180 quirks
From: Rex Buddenberg <BUDDENBERGRA@USC-ISI.ARPA>
To: info-cpm@AMSAA.ARPA
cc: BUDDENBERGRA@USC-ISI.ARPA

Some experiences with the Ciarcia SB180 computer board.
The SB180 board has some gotchas attached.  It is a solid machine,
but not without some rough edges.  Here is what a couple of us have
found:
	Reset.  A cold boot doesn't always.  The system is supposed
to come up in monitor if no disk is present in A: (or no drives
attached).  System is supposed to reboot CPM if the disc is loaded.
In both cases, it often takes several resets to get action.
	Discs.  Read the manual carefully.  Few drives come correctly
configured out of the box.  If you put an 8" drive on the system
(eg as C:), you gotta turn it on every time you use the machine.
If you don't (or turn it off without shutting down the rest of the
system), you get this Gawd-awful buzz in the 5" drives.
	Configuration.  I hooked up a couple Qume 542's and found
that you want to pull ALL the shunts except the drive
select strap.  Regarding 8" drives, a Qume DT8 came up
OK after fiddling around with the settings for a bit.  
A Tandon half height has yet to decide to cooperate.
	Kermit.  And modem programs.  Haven't yet figured out the
I/O.  The CP4 'generic' Kermit will not talk to the modem for
some reason.  Yes, I tried all the port settings.
If someone gets a Kermit front end for this thing, let me
know...  
	ASCI ports.  You get a terminal and a modem port.  The basic
bits come right out of the 64180 and only the 1488/1489 RS-232
drivers are between your terminal and the CPU.  Which is just
enough.  My printer is wired as a DTE, but the modem is a DCE.
So to avoid fooling around with null modems and such, try this.
Get a 26 pin crimp-on connector to attach the
ribbon to the board.  Get your length of ribbon cable and crimp
the connector to it in the middle.  Then wire each end to the
DB-25s however you need them.  I got one female DTE and one male
DCE so both peripherals plug in correctly.  
	Z-DOS.  You have to sort thru all the stuff on the masters
and figger out that you don't need the 4 directory programs
supplied -- 1 will do nicely.  Unfortunately there isn't a lot of help
in setting up a usable working disc configuration.  Take out
too much and you get warmed over CPM.  Put in too much and you have
disc-bloat.  Not obvious where to discriminate.  But I guess this
is a bit like inheriting your million and not knowing where to
spend it all.
	There is no readily apparent way to get from CPM to the monitor.
The reverse is obvious.  
	Summary.  This board did not come up quite as slickly as my
AMPRO Little Board, which has become my workhorse for
general stuff.  But it is in the same league.

	suggests 'Fortran IV with Watfor & Watfiv', a text that I used 
	in 1971 in high school. 'SSS Fortran' has most of the features 
	of Watfor or Watfiv except for the inherent differencs caused
	by implementation on an 8-bit micro. It runs on my Intertec 
	Compustar which is running standard CP/M 2.2.
		Supersoft's address is P.O. Box 1628, Champaign, IL

Hello netlanders,

I am getting a new computer and need to decide whether to get 96 tpi drives
or 48 tpi drives.  I know I get double the storage with 96 tpi, but I also
give up disk compatability with them don't I?  Is there a way I could
read/write a 48 tpi disks on a 96 tpi machine.  (The system is question
is the new SB180 system described in Byte.)  Can other systems write disks
for these drives?

Is anyone on the net aware of a public domain FTP or Modem7 overlay

I am sure most (all?) folks on the net have never heard of this

Subject: RESEND OF CPM KERMIT REQUEST

From: Trevor O. McCarthy:

	I sent a request three weeks ago  for information on kermit-80 for the
APPLE II series.  I cannot get it to run with an Applied Engineering Z80+ card
in slot #7 (using their CPM called "CPAM 4.1").  I have heard that some people
cannot get kermit-80 to run with Microsoft CP/M in any slot except 4 or 5.  Is
this true?  I can't change my slot assignments as all other slots have cards
or products already set up for them.

	I realise that someone may already have responded to my previous
message, but our ARPANET box was down, and I did not receive any mail. Anyone
who might have sent a response got it returned as undeliverable.  I would
appreciate a "resend" of any responses to my first message, as well as any
other replies, advice, or comments.

Thanks.

John,

You can read 48 tpi disks on 96 tpi drives by double-stepping the
head for each track; Heath H89's have been doing this for a long
time.  Writing in 48 tpi from a 96 tpi drive is another thing.
I've been told it can be done, and have seen it happen
occasionally on an IBM PC/AT, but my experience tells me it is a
very dicey business.  Reading can be done dependably, but not
writing.

I have a DEC Rainbow that uses DEC RX50 single sidded 96 tpi drives,
under MS-DOS I can read IBM PC single sidded 48 tpi disks.

There is also a program called Media Master that allows reading(and
writing) of many popular 96 & 48 tpi disks.

MM even allows the 96 tpi drive to format a disk to the popular 48 tpi
formats, Kaypro, IBM PC, Osborne.

One problem that can occur in writing is that the 96 tpi head width is
narrower than with a 48tpi drive (At least DEC claims it is) and a 48
tpi drive might have trouble reading a 48 tpi disk written with a 96 tpi
drive.
I have had very good results with this, but always use a 'new' disk to
avoid data residue that could be left from a 48 tpi write that may not
erase completly with a 96 tpi head.

To make a long story short, with the right software you can read the 48
tpi disks on the 96 tpi drives!

Subject: 96/48 TPI compatibility
To: info-cpm@AMSAA.ARPA

I have been told that reading and writing of 48TPI format disks can
be done with double stepping (for reading) and bulk erased and reformatted
(both, not one or the other - for writing) disks.  If the disks are just
reformatted, there can be some confusion on the 48TPI drive's part.

Subject: Request for CP/M help on Find Next

	I need some help on using the CP/M Find First/Find Next commands.
I use the following routine to find the first file on the disk by using
the Find First CP/M command, then open the file and print the file name.
Then I close the file and use the same routine to find the next file.
On calling this routine, the ambigious file name is pointed to by reg HL,
and the last file found is pointed to by reg DE.  Reg A contains the value
zero on the first call, and 7 on successive calls.  I stepped through this
code with DDT, and everything seems proper, but the Find Next call always
returns with Reg A = 0FFH to indicate no files found.  But files exist!

	I got this code from _The CP/M Programmer's Handbook_ by Andy
Johnson-Laird, but it never finds the second or later files.  Another
version of code using this routine finds some, but not all, of the files
on the disk.  What am I doing wrong???

	I looked through the INSIDCPM.LBR, but they are not really doing
anything similar.  When I modify the program to not open the files that
were found, but just print the names, and also to not do the Find First
again, then it finds all the files.  But I need to open the files and
copy them, and this seems to screw up the Find Next!  Can anyone help?????

Ken,

I'm glad to know it can be done with repeatability.  Any hints
you can offer on how to get the write part to work dependably
will be greatly appreciated.  My H89 won't do that at all, and
out PC/AT at the office bats no better than .400.

To:  info-cpm@BRL.ARPA
Message-ID:  <851011175646.693832@HI-MULTICS.ARPA>

I was hoping to add some hardware supported CP/M-80 capabilities to an
IBM-compatible computer.  I checked with two vendors who advertise in
BYTE (Oryx Systems Inc.  and Progressive Micro Distributors) to see if
they had the Xedex/Microlog Baby Blue II.  Both listed it, but neither
of them had it in stock.  Both said the vendor is "going bankrupt" and
it is therefore hard to get stock.  Question 1:  Is there some other
vendor that does have the Baby Blue II in stock?

A second alternative which now is appearing is the TurboSlave from Earth
computers.  This TurboSlave-PC has a Z80H, 128K of RAM, two RS232 ports,
and TurboDOS.  The price, $495 list, seems quite reasonable.  I just am
not sure I want to be the first person to try it.  Question 2:  Is there
anyone out there who has tried this board (and liked it)?

Please send your responses to Cargo at HI-Multics.  If I get any
responses I will summarize.  If I get other people asking for the
results of my query I will try to keep in touch.  $500 is not the kind
of money I would like to risk without taking a deeper look.

The cp/m 2.2 search first/search next functions must be used
with NO INTERVENING bdos or bios file i/o calls.  Search-next
proceeds from internal bdos pointers and the bios's directory
buffer contents; a close-function, for example, will change
both and a subsequent search-next will be proceeding from
the end of the directory.  It is ok to use selected other (non-file i/o)
calls between search function calls, e.g. print-character.

For what it's worth, we were so concerned about read/write of 48 tpi
on our PC/AT we spent the extra $200+ and got the optional 48 tpi
second drive.

Dick, one thing to note in Ken's earlier note was that he said he
used 2.1 not 3.1.  If the 2.1 is a typo, then he is having much better
luck than anyonelse I know.

I am looking for a cross-assambler for the 6502 type micro-processor
to run under CP/M-68K.  I doubt that such a program exists in a
ready-to-run form.  I will settle for such an assambler coded in C,
FORTRAN or Pascal in source form, which I could then translate (if
not C) and compile for my CP/M-68K system.  As another alternitive,
an assambler that runs on the VAX will be ok, if that is all that is
available.

 I believe you are wrong about the interpreter part. But you are right about
all the rest. It was the best diagnostic compiler/interpreter I have ever

At one time, Corvus offered an option for their hard disk systems called
the 'Mirror', which allowed backing up hard disks to a VCR.  I don't
know whether it is still offered, what the cost is, or whether it is
available for a non-Corvus drive, but in principle it can be done.
Anyone else have more?

The heads in a 96 tpi drive are *definitely* narrower than on a 48 tpi
drive.  I have successfully "read back" from a 96 tpi drive using a
Shugart SA 455.  I use this drive in my PC AT, and have no problems
reading from the 1.2 MB drive.  However, I have not been able to get
reliable readback using the Tandon or CDC drives IBM uses in PC's, or
with Teac drives.  It all depends on the head sensitivity, and also the
media quality.  

This approach is strictly for those who don't need backups.

For those who can roll their own, for less than 100 today, you can buy
a standard half-high SA 455.    Five bucks (see PC World back pages)
gets you a set of mounting rails.  You'll find a trace on the SA 455's
motherboard for  pin 34.  Cut this trace, and voila, you now have an
AT-compatible drive.  For drives without such a trace or jumper, just
cover pin 34 with some tape.  Install the drive as drive B, following
the AT's Installation Manual instructions, and you now have a two-floppy
system.  (Always convenient for floppy duplication.)  

At this price, there's no reason to take chances.

    If anyone has an old (1.5 - 2 years) Morrow MD-11 that has troubles
with the hard disk, you might be interested in knowing that there is new
distribution software out that is more sofisticated about bad sectors on
the hard disk.  My troubles were caused by personal Pearl trying to write
to a bad sector.  When the service rep loaded with the new software, the
sectors were properly remapped, and the machine works like a charm!

    There is also an upgrade for some PAL chips, and my rep recommended a
new fan (the old models tend to over heat).

    So you might want to look into this before you run into these problems,
so that you don't loose any thing if it happens.  That's right, my backup
is worthless...

We recently purchased a Compaq AT compatable and were having trouble
formating diskettes.  The unit has one 96tpi and one 48tpi drives.
After talking with the service people at the store, here is the summary:

-a 96 tpi drive can read and write* 48 tpi format.
-a 48 tpi drive can read diskettes formated to 48 tpi by a 96 tpi drive.
-use High Density media when writing with 96 tpi drives.
-use double density media when writing with 48 tpi drives.

*We were told that 96 tpi drives heads are narrower and that the write
current is different than 48 tpi drives.  Therefore, 48 tpi drives
cannot write on HD media and 96 tpi drive cannot write on 2D (double
density media).

Think twice about getting BDS C: it may compile very fast, but it is
non-standard enough to make porting a pain. If you have no intention of
ever recompiling your code on another system that's fine, otherwise...

More standard low price compilers for CP/M are C/80 with Mathpak
(produces very efficient code) and Q/C (comes with source code!) among
others. MIX C was been prematurely anounced at $39.95 three months ago
and they aren't shipping yet (hmm...).

Check the C compiler reviews in Dr. Dobbs, Byte and Computer Language
for some very complete info.

I'm interested in your program, it looks like a fine extension to
bishow...please let me know how I can get a copy of the program to post
on a CPM BBS that I run here in Dallas.

I tried sending this directly, but the mailer had some problems
w/ what I thought the address was, so re. the find/next problem:

If you can print the names properly, I would suggest COPYING
each name as find next finds them, then after all names have
been found use your list of file names to open each of them.

Gee, I used WATFOR in 1968 on an IBM 360.  They (Univ. of Waterloo) also
released in about that time frame WATFIV (WATerloo Fortran IV) and a 
terrific Assembler.  I was very impressed with their compilers.

The Ampro can read 48TPI disks on 96TPI drives, and since Joe Wright wrote
the BIOS for the SB180 and is/was heavily involved in the Ampro software I
suspect the SB180 will also support this capability. Another solution is 
to spend the $20 for a single sided 48TPI drive and use it as a spare for
compatibility purposes.

A 96tpi drive CAN read disks written on a 48tpi drive; the second part
of the construction article for that same SB180 implies as much.  The 
BIOS needs some extra code to realize it must double-step for these
disk formats.  The major problem as I understand it is that in writing, 
the 96tpi drive lays down a narrower 'track' than the 48tpi drive (makes 
sense), which may either get lost against a previously written 'wide' 
track if the disk has been used before in a 48tpi drive, or simply be 
too narrow for the 48tpi drive's head to get a useful signal from.

Hope this helps.

Subject: SB180 & Tandon half-height drives

You can get one Tandon half-height drive to work with a SB180 system
by jumpering it so that the drive is selected all the time.  It should
also be jumpered so that the 'Motor On' function is NOT controlled by
the drive selection, i.e., the seperate 'Motor On' signal line is
used.  Having the drive selected all the time precludes the use of
multiple drives.  There appears to be a strange timing incompatability
between the disk controller on the SB180 and the Tandon drives.  I
think I may have to peel the drive select lines coming out of the disk
controller off and run them into some special circuitry and then into
the Tandon drives to be able to use multiple drives.  For now, I at
least can boot ZRDOS and make back ups.  Be informed that the Tandon
drives don't support the READY line.  You must jumper the JP6
selection on the SB180.  I installed a switch on this jumper, so that
I can get to the SB180 monitor.  When JP6 is wired permanently, the
monitor thinks the drive is always ready, and thus tries to autoboot.
You can fix this be reburning a new monitor PROM, but I haven't gotten
around to this yet.

Subject:  Reading & writing 48 tpi on 96 tpi drives

Please note that I DID say I'm using DOS 2.10 to write my 48 tpi disks on
the 96 tpi drives. I can't say what happens after the disks have been on
the shelf for a year because I've only had my AT a few months. I have
definitely been able to read these 48 tpi disks on my XT, though, so I am
NOT just reading them on the same kind of drive I'm writing on. (The XT has
standard 48 tpi drives.) As far as brands are concerned, my 96 tpi drive
is the standard one that comes with all AT's from IBM. I would estimate
that I've read at least 15 diskettes on a 48 tpi drive that were created on
the 96 tpi drive. That may not be enough to reach any definite conclusions,
but so far success has been 100%. I should also mention that about half of
these diskettes were 48 tpi, the other half 96 tpi formatted to 48. So the
statement that you shouldn't use the 96 tpi disks at 48 format doesn't seem
to hold, either.
	I can't remember if there's any difference between the way DOS 2.10
and DOS 3.0 write 48 tpi diskettes, because I've always used strictly DOS
2.10. Can someone help me out on that? If there is, then this may be the
source of the problem for you 3.0 people. Using the HIDE/UNHIDE utilities
in the public domain you should be able to rename you hidden dos files and
maintain both operating systems on your hard disk. Or come to think of it,
I guess all you'd need is both versions of FORMAT.

Message-ID: <[USC-ECLB.ARPA]15-Oct-85 06:00:46.STANLEY>

Netlandians:

I need some bright suggestions.  I have recently installed the
CDR Super-RAM in my Heath H89.  This gizmo contains a megabyte of
RAM (41256's) that can be accessed as a RAM disk, with 64K of the
1024K serving as the computer's main memory.  The RAM install
program allows you to boot from the RAM disk, by partitioning it
into two logical disks, A: and B:, and "sliding" the physical
disks up two logical slots.  So, when I turn on the H89, I boot
from physical and logical disk A:, but after I run the INSRAM
installation program, physical disk A: is now logical disk C:.

OK, that is how it is set up.  However, since the installation,
the system has had a large number of spurious responses.
Sometimes the keyboard will lock up for no apparent reason.
Sometimes, I will return to the H89 to find input showing on the
command line that I did not type.  Other times, the terminal will
just go crazy, ringing the bell and filling the screen with
garbage.  These responses also seem to have the effect of
inserting spurious characters into files on the RAM drives.

I have checked everything thoroughly, and all seems OK.  The
terminal section passes all the standard tests.  The response
seems independent of terminal speed, or whether I am running with
the RAM disk as A:, or as some higher disk.  It also happens when
running from floppies, without having installed the RAM disk!

The H89 is connected to a power conditioner, so I don't think
power glitches are a problem.  But when these gremlins take over,
the only way to recover is to reset and re-boot the H89.  The RAM
disk files are not lost, but as noted above, they are often
trashed.

I would welcome any suggestions to help solve this problem.

                                ...Dick Stanley

Richard,

    Try this.  When you find the first file with search for first
save the name away in a buffer.  Then when you are ready to search
for next, do a search for first again with the UNambigious filename
you stored away (this will get you back to where you left off).
THEN do your search for next with your ambigious file spec.  Of course
you will need to save any filename found now for the next search for
next.

Paul,

	Thanks for your help, but that is what I tried.  Please look at my
code, which I got from _The CP/M Programmer's Handbook_ by Andy Johnson-Laird.
I have the address of the ambigious filename in reg HL, and the unambigious
file name in reg DE.  I search for the "destination" FCB (the one found last
time), then search for the next one using the ambigious FCB, which I have
copied into the "destination" FCB.  In one case, it never finds the second
filename.  In another case, it finds 17 out of 25 filenames.  I can see no
patterns in what it does and does not find.

	My code is not exactly like that in the book,
but the idea is the same.

	Excerpted from my subroutine to get first/next filename.
The entire subroutine was posted last time.  This is just the part that
finds the NEXT filename.  The DMA buffer has been set up already.
The "destination" FCB is the one that was filled last time from the one
found.  The file name in that FCB has been opened and closed, using this
FCB.  The "source" FCB is the ambigious file name used in the last
"find first/find next" call to this subroutine.

I have a friend who happily used NULU12 to squeeze files on his
molecular super micro-x running a hard-disk with 8k blocks.  Apparently
he squeezed nsweep2 was used, and put in a library using nulu.  Two
problems, when he tries to view certain members or extract , he gets a
disk error, other members have some parts of their file name
disappearing.  Any suggestions to

A- recovery

or

B- versions that won't do this in the future.

Thanks, Allan

Also NSWP2 gave disk errors when the files were being squeezed (some of
them it just did not squeeze) when a mass sqeeze was used on NSWP2.

I purchased a Rainbow from DEC bundled with MBASIC and MULTIPLAN.  It came
with an impressive collection of manuals, but the impression faded soon,
when i discovered that there was no documentation on ddt, ddt86, or the 
details of writing in asm or asm86.  Are other Rainbow owners in the same
fix?  Can anyone point me to where i can fill in the missing documentation?

Subject: Problem with card slots & CP/M
To: info-apple@MIT-MC.ARPA, info-cpm@MIT-MC.ARPA


   I am trying to use an SSM serial interface card (note:  NOT the Super-Serial
card!) on an Apple II+ CP/M system with a Diablo 630 printer.  The card works
fine from Applesoft BASIC but if I try to go into CP/M, the system freezes up.
I have tried two CP/M cards, and the same problem occurs with both.  I have
tried both MicroSoft 60k CP/M and the 10MB Sider hard drive's 60k CP/M, and
the problem occurs with both CP/Ms here too.  My slots are configured as
follows:

0  16k expansion card
1  SSM serial interface card (to Diablo 630)
2  Apple-Cat II/212a modem
3  Viewmax-80 80col/lowercase
4  MicroSoft-Compatible CP/M card
5  EMPTY
6  Floppy controller
7  10MB Sider controller

   If I put the serial card in slot #5, I can use CP/M but it will not send
anything to the printer -- I suppose this is because CP/M expects the printer
to be interfaced to slot #1.  Is there any way around this problem, or does
anyone know any possible configuration that will let me use the Sider's CP/M
with a Diablo 630 on the SSM serial card?

I don't know what you mean here.

I agree. However, part of the problems being encountered stem from the
fact that arpanet people want to share *extensively* with non-arpa people.
This implicitly implies an exchange of information that goes beyond purely
military activities. If you throw out many ads, you're throwing the clothes
out with the bathwater. Essentially, I agree that ads, under the proclaimed
goals of arpa, are against the rules. However, banning some ads will
certainly harm the goals of arpa, namely, increased, effective interaction
with the defense support community ( note, not only the dod itself, since if 
this were the goal they could cut the lines or use the darpa ( not arpa )
network. )

When I post an ad to a non-arpa newsgroup, is it my fault that someone
automatically forwards it to every defense site? No, as long as i am not
violating the rules of the local newsgroup, i can't be to blame. Rather,
it is the group of arpa folks who crave and subcribe to this newsgroup that
have asked for extra baloney. 

Of course, when the ads violate non-arpa standards, then the poster is to
blame. But that debate also belongs to the users of the lan, not the
incidental subscribers from the arpanet. 

I hope i haven't infuriated to many generals by writing this stuff, since
it is fairly political by nature. Can we agree to disagree? I still think that
no matter what, one must abide by the rules of the community of users, and
that there is a place for compromise for mutually benefitting parties.

Russ (et al),
(Russ responded to Ted Emigh about SCAN, suggesting it might be a good
extension to bishow.}
I did a hack and put assembler routines for Unsqueezing squeezed text
files into BISHOW.  Works just fine, but .. since you're having to
buffer text (to permit paging back and forth), it's aggravating to
wait not only while your system reads in from disk a new buffer full,
but then the Unsqueezing too.  Since I used two different buffer sizes
(one for reads, one for the unsqueezed text), it got a little strange.
Worked .. but as I said, aggravating.

If you wanna see how I did it, yell, and I'll (painstakingly) upload
the source code where you can FTP it.

Eric,

    When I post an ad to a non-arpa newsgroup, is it my fault that
    someone automatically forwards it to every defense site?  No, as
    long as i am not violating the rules of the local newsgroup, i
    can't be to blame.  Rather, it is the group of arpa folks who
    crave and subcribe to this newsgroup that have asked for extra
    baloney.

You have it backwards.  For the record, I started INFO-CPM at MIT-MC
as an ARPANET mailing list spinoff of INFO-MICRO on 29 August 1980.
The uucp newgroup was subsequently created to subscribe to this list.
The same sequence occurred earlier when I resurrected INFO-MICRO after
it had become dormant for about a year.  There are several other
newsgroups with similar ARPANET origins, such as HUMAN-NETS, the first
digest format mailing list and SF-LOVERS.

One of the reasons that several mailing lists went to digest format
was to filter out such for-sale messages to save the list from being
disbanded.  Over the years, both INFO-CPM and INFO-MICRO lists have
been occassionally hit with for-sale messages, with the subsequent
flurry of messages reminding people of the restrictions imposed on the
ARPA community and redirecting the poster to the apparently little
known and used for-sale or wanted newsgroups.  At times, there is even
a suggestion that these lists be converted to digest format to filter
for-sale messsages.  Unfortunately, no one wants to volunteer as the
burnout rate for moderators of high-volume lists is also high.

You ask if we can agree to disagree.  The answer is no.  For sale
message to newsgroups such as INFO-CPM and INFO-MICRO will not be
tolerated.  For-sale messages leaking into what is now called DDN
(Defense Data Network) is quite a serious matter.  There is mention of
it in netiquette, which every potential poster to a newsgroup should
read.  The consequences on the DDN side if users from a particular
host do not observe this restriction is to pull their connection from
the net.  This has never actually happened, but it has come close on
more than one occassion in the early years.  The consequences on the
uucp side is to drop the gateway.  We do not wish to do that.  But if
you insist on ignoring our restrictions, we have no choice.

SYSLIB contains a set of routines for directory accessing, and the
source code may help in answering your questions.  The DIRF routine
inits a buffer area, loads a disk directory, selects a set of files
from the loaded dir, selects user areas, packs the dir, and alphabetizes.
DIRFS does the same, but provides information on file sizes as well (and runs slower).
There are also DIRLOAD and DIRSLOAD.

	The source code is in the SDIR.MAC modules of SYSLIB3: on SIMTEL20.
I think there are several SDIR*.MAC modules there.

Hi Russ,

This is not specifically in reply to your message above, but prompted by
it and today's reply by David Kirschbaum.  When I visited you this
summer you mentioned that you had a friend up at PARC who has an account
on the VAX that can get to SIMTEL20.  I have such an account also but
haven't been able to get it to work.  Could you give me his name and net
address?  I'd like to contact him and have him forward to me the Chat
typescript from such a session so I can see what I am doing wrong.  Then
possibly I can 'share the load' in getting new programs for [ISIS]<CPM>
and your RCPM (as my time allows!).

What about parity ????  Can anyone help ?

The following is the text of a letter I sent today to Applied Engineering
about their Ramworks ramdisk driver for the PCPI Applicard CPM card for the
Apple II series.

My question for the net is --

Does anybody have a fix for these problems?

Also, if Steven N. Hirsch is on the net (He appears to have been the author
of the driver in question...)  would he please get in touch with me.

Please respond by E-mail, if possible.

Thanks in advance

PO Box 798
Carrollton Texas 75006


Dear Sirs:

I recently bought a copy of your ramdrive device driver for the Applied
Engineering Ramworks(tm) board and the PCPI Applicard(tm).

I have noticed a couple of problems with it that I hope you will
correct in later releases.  I would also appreciate it if you could
send me an appropriate patch for the release I have.

I am using it on an 'enhanced' Apple IIe, with an Applicard in slot 4,
an Apple Super-Serial card in slot 1 for my serial printer, an Apple
Duo-Disk in slot 6, and an Apple extended 80 column color card in
the Auxiliary slot.  I was told over the phone by your tech support
people before I bought it, that the software would work with the
Apple color card just as well as with the Ramworks card, though the
resulting ramdrive would be small.  In fact it does seem to work
quite well.  There is enough room in the ramdrive for a copy of
Turbo Pascal, PIP, and a few other useful utilities, and even a small
amount of scratch space left over.  I have a small "SUBMIT" file on
my boot disk that loads up the ramdrive with the things I want on it
at system startup time.  The feature of configuring the ramdrive as
disk A: is really very nice! 

The first problem is really quite trivial, and I would not mention
it at all, except that I am already writing to you about the second
problem.  The first problem is that the "R" and "W" that are supposed
to flash in the lower right corner of the screen, appear as mousetext
instead of letters on my enhanced IIe.  As I say, not a big problem,
but something worth noting for future releases.  Personally, I would
have preferred to hear the speaker grumble a little bit when the
ramdrive was working, instead of having one character of my screen be
taken away from me, but that is a matter of preference.  (After all,
real disk drives make noise when they are doing something, why not the
ramdrive too?)

The second problem is somewhat more serious.  The README.WS file that
comes on the same disk with the software warns of a potential conflict
between the PCPI BUFFER.DVR printer driver and the ramdrive software
over control of the first (in my case the only) bank of auxiliary
memory.  It says to "Be aware of this, and install accordingly."  But
it does not say what installing accordingly means.  Is there an
alternate printer driver that does not use the aux memory?
Or is there a patch to BUFFER.DVR to prevent it from using the
aux memory.  BUFFER.DVR works just fine without the auxiliary
memory on machines without the extended 80-column card.  It buffers in
the leftover part of main memory.  So it presumably could be patched 
to ignore aux memory altogether, but the README.WS file does not
give a clue as to how to accomplish this.

With these questions in my mind, I said to myself, "nothing ventured,
nothing gained." and decided to try it anyway.  To my surprise, it
seemed to work!  I put things in the ramdrive, and got them back
intact.  I queued up several small files to the printer and could
still use the ramdrive.  The queued files printed fine.  They were
obviously not being overwritten by the stuff I put in the ramdrive. 
So, OK, BUFFER.DVR must be using the leftover main memory first, and
only going to the aux memory as a last resort.  "Well," said I,
"lets really load it up and watch it rip!"  So I queued up a very
large file to print that should have filled up the available main
memory and sloshed over into the aux memory, then tried some ramdrive
activity.  Still OK!  "Better and better!" said I, feeling really
fine.  But still, that warning in the README.WS file must have meant
something!  So I queued up a second copy of the same print file and
about half way through it, the entire system hung.  Everything stopped
at once.  I had to cold boot to clear it up.

So the conclusion is that if I am careful not to fill up the printer
buffer too full, I can use it the way I have it configured.  But it
would be awfully nice to have some kind of patch that would keep it
from hanging if I get careless and queue up too much printer output.
Also, the README.WS file should be more explicit on the subject of
"installing accordingly".

	DEC sells three manual sets for the Rainbow, each one is
(I believe) about $75.  I do not know why DEC does not include any
data with its systems unless you buy the manual set, but that is what
they do.  If you want to know ANYTHING about the operating systems
(other than the most basic stuff), you must buy the manual set.
I could not even use MS-DOS DEBUG without the manual set.

	The manuals are as follows:

		CP/M Technical Documentation Manual
		MS-DOS Technical Documentation Manual
		Rainbow 100B/100+ Technical Documentation Manual.

	The CP/M and MS-DOS manuals contain data on the operating systems,
and the other one is for the hardware itself.  The hardware manual includes
complete specs on the boards, connectors, memory map, etc.  The operating
system manuals give only memory maps for the operating system itself and
the interrupts they use, plus BIOS listings, etc.

	All are from DECDIRECT.  When I bought mine, they sent the manuals
for the 100A, not the 100B.  It took me quite a while to get the right ones.
I hope that they have that corrected by now.  If not, and you get the
wrong manuals, you only have 30 days to correct the mistake.

Ken - DOS 3.0/1 gives you the capability of formatting the 1.2 mb 
floppies on the 96tpi drive.  I don't believe that 2.1 supports that.

Considering the advantages of 3.0/1, I am somewhat suprised that
you are still using 2.1; especially on an AT.  I guess, though,
if you are happy with 2.1, there's no motivation to move-up.

        Put briefly, I need to know how I can find the address of
        the current DMA area.

        Expansion:

        I'm running CP/M-80 Ver. 2.2. This enables me to set the DMA to
        anywhere I like; fair enough, there's a system call for it
        (26). But I can't find any way to set it back to what it was
        before, only the default at 80H.

        The reason I want to do this is that I'm designing a print
        spooler for my home system, a Gemini Multi-Board system,
        using an area in my RAM-disk for the spool file(s) and
        interrupts from a real-time clock to drive the despooling.
        Now, sooner or later my interrupt routine is going to want
        to read a sector from the RAM-disk when an application
        program has set the DMA address to somewhere other than the
        default area. If I restore the DMA address from that used by
        the despooler to the default - Blooey!!

        I can't find this data in my Digital Research manuals.

        Any help would be very welcome.

        If there is a lot of interest, I'll summarise to the net.

        Many thanks,

I don't debate the order of events or event the role of the arpanet in 
fostering interest in various areas. You win that battle, though you don't win

I'd really like to hear a definition of net.micro.cpm that doesn't include
INFO-CPM. Are they one and the same group? Or are they different?
This issue goes beyond ad postings. The meat of it is, who calls the shots.
Does arpanet call the shots in usenet newsgroups? It appears so. If this is
the case, then let's just admit it once and for all.


Also, if this group is gateway'd to arpa, why isn't it called fa.info-cpm
rather than net.micro.cpm. Or even better, mail.info-cpm?
On usenet, this *is* the ettiquite. Or am I mistaken?

Overall, you totally miss the point. 

If a usenet newsgroup allows ads ( e.g. na.for-sale ) and those ads
are forwarded all over the DDN, who ( as a result ) deserves to be yanked off
of the net - the poster or the person who made the connection? 
It's a chicken or the egg problem, except among certain net historians and
finger pointers. 

-------
The answer obviously lies in negotiation and observing the tendancies that
will best help *both* newsgroups. 
-------

And it is here that I think we should
agree to disagree on . I think limited ads are useful, even for arpanet 
types, and certainly for non-arpa types. This is a *philosophical* stance, not a
*political* one.  Politically, you guys win. After all, Mr DoD pays my paycheck
also.  ( After i've paid him, of course ). Believe me, I know the rules and try 
to abide by them.

But the issue over whether there is a legitimate advantage in terms of
communication in using one forum versus the other is just not settled!
You don't decide what is best, you explore and find out! Just like with
television and radio, it is not possible to foresee all the ways a medium
may be used. I personally would like to see many, many more people use
networks like this if only for the reason that it makes certain kinds of
activities easier to accomplish. And I don't think that this can happen
without cost, but what other major technologies didn't get started in the
defense sector?  I am pro-technology and pro-effective communication,
not anti-arpa. Peek at the larger issue, rather than the most obvious
( and redundant ) interpretation.


But aside from the noise here, this discussion was 
old  before it started. I give up.
No hard feelings, I hope.

I have posted the files for Software Tools in Pascal (Turbo Pascal
version) to SIMTEL20 as:

Filename			Type	 Bytes	 CRC

Directory MICRO:<CPM.TURBOPAS>
TRBTOL86.LBR.1			BINARY	 70784  0559H

This library contains the source from the book "Software Tools in
Pascal" by B.W. Kernighan and P.J. Plauger, Addison-Wesley.  It has
been adapted for Turbo Pascal.  Accepts redirection, but not pipes.
The version using TURBO is fast enough to make this a useful set of
tools for file manipulation.

The primitives in this version are basically the UCSD Pascal versions
presented in the book, with modifications for Turbo Pascal.

This version has been modified for use under Turbo Pascal v. 3.0 under
CP/M-86.  There are no system dependent statements in the code to the
best of my knowledge, so it should work under MS-DOS as well.

The original version (typed in by Bill McGee) was set up for CP/M-80
and used the CHAIN capability of Turbo Pascal.  I have eliminated that
feature in favor of using INCLUDE files.  There is not enough memory
available in a CP/M-80 system for this version, but one could modify
the include file list to eliminate unwanted features or to make more
than one version, (e.g. break out EDIT, FORMAT, and DEFINE).

There was really only one change required to the McGee's original to
get it to work with version 3.0.  A readln(TRM) had to be added in the
subroutine GETKBD.  The change to CP/M-86 required replacing all calls
to the procedure BDOS(0,0) with HALT.  This change works with the
CP/M-80 version of Turbo Pascal v. 3.0 as well.  Thus, as anyone can
see, all of the hard work was done by Bill.

Please note that this is copyrighted software.  Right has been granted
to freely distribute or duplicate this software, providing
distribution or duplication is not for profit or other commercial gain
and that the copyright notice within remains intact.

I originally received these from a telephone BBS without the copyright
notices.  I spoke with Brian Kernighan and he indicated that, as far
as he was concerned, there was no problem if suitable copyright
notices were included.  The notice I used is the same as the one on
the Chris Lewis version already archived.  I also spoke to Bill McGee,
the originator of these files.  He said that he did little more than
type them in and felt no proprietary interest of his was involved.
Likewise, I only made a few simple modifications to get the programs
working under CP/M-86.

There has been a lot of interest in the Software Tools for Turbo
Pascal on the nets, judging by all the mail I have received recently.
I particularly like the translit program.  And I want to use the macro
expansion program on a project I'm working on.

I find the editor not too useful and the archive program ditto.

ReSent-To: Info-Cpm@BRL.ARPA
ReSent-Date: Sat 19 Oct 1985 12:54-MDT

This message announces the posting of version 1.0 of the WA8DED
firmware for the TAPR TNC-1.  It is being posted on SIMTEL20 on the
ARPANET. Some Usenet guru will have to carry on from there for the
usenet folks.

Version 0.91 was posted there previously. Version 1.0 has a few
additional features, mostly in the monitoring area, and a few bug
fixes.

The new files are available from SIMTEL20 as:

Filename			Type	 Bytes	 CRC

Directory MICRO:<CPM.PACKET>
TNCDED10.DOC.1			ASCII	 34730  3A91H
TNCDED10.HEX.1			ASCII	 46093  0F18H
TNCDED10.MSG.1			ASCII	  4022  85C3H

This firmware runs on the TAPR TNC-1 and its clones, the AEA and the
Heath HD-4040 TNCs.  It is NOT an upgrade of the TAPR code. It is a
completely new implementation of the AX.25 protocol, both the current
version 2.0 and the older 1.x version supported by the normal TAPR
code. It also supports up to four simultaneously open connections on
one TNC.  And it has a "host friendly" mode, which is intended to
simplify the interfacing of the TNC to a Bulletin Board or other
computer system. It has noticeably fewer protocol bugs than the TAPR
code, and a much more informative Monitor mode.

The command interface is NOT the same as the TAPR TNC code.  It is
therefore not just an improvement for your TNC, but a complete change
of the interface. So you might not want it if you (or your computer)
are used to the standard interface.

The files being posted are: This message, TNCDED10.MSG; The
documentation file, TNCDED10.DOC; and the binary of the code itself,
in Intel Hex format, in TNCDED10.HEX.

The code occupies two 2764 EPROMs (actually about 1.2 EPROMs - plenty
of space left in the second one).  The EPROMs reside at C000 and E000
of the TNC, sockets U11 and U12 respectively.  If you need to
manipulate this file with a CP/M DDT, remember to use an offset with
the I command so that you don't overwrite your DDT, BDOS and BIOS. Put
C000 through DFFF into the EPROM for U11, and put E000 through FFFF
into the EPROM for U12.

The code and documentation are copyrighted 1985 by Ronald Raikes,
WA8DED. They are submitted with his permission for non-commercial use
by individual Radio Amateurs. All other rights reserved by Ronald
Raikes.

The program is written in 6809 assembler. The source code is not being
posted, but is available from Ron by sending him an 8" SSSD CP/M
format disk in a reusable mailer with return postage.  Enclose a
letter agreeing to the above personal use restriction.  To ease the
load on Ron, I will also make copies under the same ground rules.

Eric, there is a bottom line to all this.  If the ads continue, the
gateway between net.micro.cpm and INFO-CPM will be discontinued.  I
don't think any of us want to see that.  We ALL gain a lot by the free
flow of information and ideas between readers on both networks.

Many net.micro.cpm readers have told me that they value my
announcements of new public-domain software as it becomes available,
even though they cannot access SIMTEL20.  They know that MOST of the
new files are available either on their local RCPM or my RCPM Royal
Oak (MI).

I suggest we terminate this discussion before someone decides to pull
the gateway.  It's pointless to argue who is right.

    (Russ responded to Ted Emigh about SCAN, suggesting it might be a good
    extension to bishow.)

    (David did a hack and put assembler routines for Unsqueezing squeezed
    text files into BISHOW.)

Hold on there!  Aren't you all reinventing the wheel?  I thought
everyone know about:

Filename                        Type     Bytes   CRC

Directory MICRO:<CPM.TXTUTL>
BISHOW31.AQM.1                  BINARY   32384  525DH

This version has been around a LONG time (since January 1984).
It will read normal or squeezed files AND files inside LBRs!

Here is a short bit of the update history:

title   'BISHOW v3.01 - buffered bidirectional file scroll utility'

Ver 3.01, 15 Jan 84, Frans van Duinen, Toronto, Ont
        - made unsqueeze message optional
        - added library capability
        - fixed bug in conditional assembly of CLRSCR

Ver 2.09, 7 Jan 84, Frans van Duinen, Toronto, Ont
        - Modified USQ routines for higher speed (+10%) and
          less memory usage.
        - made USQ code optional through conditional assembly
        - fixed a bug introduced with 2.08 and SHORT=TRUE 
          (resulted from ASM's inability to nest IF/ENDIF) 
        - fixed a bug  that reset FCBEX after open, whenever
          sector 0 was read, (this resulted in BDOS assuming that
          the current extent, whose allocation group nos were still
          in the FCB, was the correct one. 
        - Changed exit to clear screen only on Q or ^C exit,
          to leave any messages visible
        - Made wait after clear screen a cond assembly option

Ver 2.08, 2 Jan 84, Frans van Duinen, Toronto, Ont
        - added squeezed file capability
        - added sidewise scrolling on ^I, ^L, steps of 8
        - Osborne support for cursor keys, clr scr & scr size
        - Changed FILBAK rtn to recognize top of file
        - Set up flag to avoid unnecessary re-reading of
          top of file 

        The unsqueeze code was lifted from the USQ base code
        by Dave Rand (Edmonton, Alberta) as adapted for LTYPE1
        by S.Kluger (El Paso,Texas)
        The code was lifted to allow continued use of ASM.COM

	"Now, sooner or later my interrupt routine is going to want

        program has set the DMA address to somewhere other than the
        default area."  - Peter Kendell <pete@stc.UUCP>

Worse yet, it might try to do so during the execution of another system
call.  In the case of CP/M 2.2 you can probably guard against this
eventuality simply by checking for saved PC >= base of BDOS.  For CP/M+
one would also have to test for BANK not equal to 1 (as well as assure
the interrupt service routine resides in common memory!).  Is there a
better way, anyone?

As for finding the DMA address, in CP/M+ it's kept in SCB+3C, but for
2.2 I'm not sure.  It is passed to BIOS function 12 (SETDMA), so if you
have BIOS source you can figure out where your BIOS saves it.  If not,
you might have to resort to disassembling BDOS function 26 (sigh...).

Agreed, it was prematurly anounced, by they *are* shipping.  Someone I
worked with just got his copy.  Some time ago, I posted a favorable
review for the MIX editor.  In all my spare time :-) I plan to evaluate
the MIX compiler, also.

I have a Compupro computer which I upgraded to use the Macrotech
MI-286 board, which is a direct replacement for the Compupro 8088/85
board.  I would like to upgrade my operating system to Concurrent
DOS8-16, but, Compupro has fixed up their loader and SW! programs to
detect the non-Compupro board.  Does anyone know how to either change
the software so it thinks everything is OK or to fix the harware to the
same end.  The Macrotech board was sufficiently expensive that I find
changing to Viasyn's 286 and Z-80 boards unattractive.  And I don't want to
buy the Concurrent DOS without some assurance that it can be made to
work with the Macrotech board.

Thanks,

Has anyone out there tried the MIX C compiler and Editor for CP/M?  What do
you think of it?  It is better than the Manx Aztec CII compiler?  What is
the code like?  How complete is it?  How fast?  Any advice given will be
greatly appreciated.

Message-ID: <32179@lanl.ARPA>

To:       info-cpm@AMSAA.ARPA


I have just recently brought up MEX114 on my Compupro system.  As it
stands when I try to use the echo-screen-to-printer mode the whole
system hangs after 100 or so characters.  If I put pointers to my
own routines in the list output vector and the list status vector, I
find that the status routine is called frequently and the list device
is ready, but there never seems to be a call to the output routine.
All of this is probably cockpit trouble, but while I'm struggling I
thought I would put out a query in the faint hope that someone will
say "Oh, yeah.  What you need to do is..."
By the way, the symptoms are the same under CP/M-80 and CP/M-816.

Any thoughts would be appreciated.

p.s.  I vaguely recall having a problem with the list status returned
by my BIOS when I installed MODEM730 a while back.  Very strange.

Thanks,

Subject: CP/M help on Find Next - unlimited number of names

A complete routine for doing the search-first/search-next without
building a table (i.e., has NO limit on the number of file names) is
included in my COPYFILE program.  It's available from SIMTEL20 as:

Filename			Type	 Bytes	 CRC

Directory MICRO:<CPM.FILCPY>
CPYFIL15.LBR.1			BINARY	  8576  AAECH

This program will copy files of any length from one drive to another,
with 16k (optionally larger) buffering.  It was created for very long
files (megabyte length), which are not properly handled by CP/M 2.x
PIP.  This version offers selective copying of files - something not
available with PIP.  The destination files will have NO attributes
set, which is useful for copying from CP/M 2.x to 1.4 disks.

COMMANDS:
	COPYFILE [drive:]<filename.filetype> <destination drive:>[/S]
	Requires the use of the /S option if transfer
	of files with SYS attribute is wanted.

EXAMPLES:
	COPYFILE MYFILE.ASM B:
		gets MYFILE.ASM from default disk and copies to B:
	COPYFILE A:MYFILE.ASM B:
		gets MYFILE.ASM from A: and copies to B:
	COPYFILE B:*.* A:
		gets all files from B: and copies to A:
		
All normal ambiguous file names are allowed.

Subject:  AMSAA is temporarily in netmail limbo:

Fellow CP/Mers - After a LONG wait for new network access hardware, AMSAA.ARPA
(the machine from which info-cpm is distributed) is now on the BRL fiber-optic
ring-net with a new net address, 192.5.24.10.  Unfortunately, at this time
it's a case of "close-but-no-cigar" because the network host tables have not
been updated yet; that should happen soon.  The old net interface still works,
and still answers to the old net address, 128.20.3.1, but only if it is
plugged-in, which at this moment it is not.  Therefore, incoming mail may be
sporadically rejected for a day or two longer.  But once the new net address
is propagated, AMSAA should settle down to being on the net 24 hours a day
like in the "good old days" before lightening zapped the network interface.

     Just a little longer, folks...

If you own or plan to buy or build the SB180 super 8-bit computer
designed by Steve Ciarcia of BYTE magazine and manufactured by
Micromint you may wish to look into becoming a member of N.A.O.G.  It
has been formed on Steve's suggestion and with the cooperation, but
NOT ownership, of Micromint.

The N.A.O.G. newsletter will be delivered via first-class mail each
month, starting in January.  It will be edited by User's Guide
"Advanced User" columnist Bruce Morgen, former Computer Editor of
Electronic Products magazine.  Each newsletter will contain news of
the latest SB180-compatible hardware and software, including Z-System
hints and tutorials, news of the latest program revisions and hardware
upgrades from Micromint and from the N.A.O.G. membership.

Starting with the second newsletter, disks will be available to
members for a little over the cost of media and mailing, each with
about 300K of software as described in the preceding newsletters.

The North American One-Eighty Group will be officially announced in
the December BYTE, the issue that will include Steve's new Turn-Key
Bulletin Board System (TKBBS), based on the SB180, the new COMM180
modem/SCSI board, Rick Conn's TERM3 and Tim Gary's Z-Msg software.

An introductory one-year N.A.O.G. membership is $12 per year,
including twelve issues of the newsletter as well as user disk
privileges and access to the members-only sections of the N.A.O.G.
TKBBS remote system.

I know it doesn't help CP/M 2.2 users, but ZRDOS offers at GETDMA function
as well as a SETDMA function.  Hence, there's your answer in a Z-System
environment.  Also, since ZRDOS is one-level reentrant, you don't have to
worry about this happening during a DOS call.

Subject: uucp net access to SIMTEL20 PD files

    Is this stuff restricted only to persons on the arpanet?  I've been
    seeing lots of reference to PD material here in net.micro.cpm, but it
    seems that most all of it, and all of you, are out in ARPAland.  Is
    there any reason for a lowly uucp netter to be reading this stuff?

Ed, thanks for your note.  Simtel20 is not accessable from the uucp
net, unfortunately.  If you have access to an Arpanet or Milnet host
you can use FTP to get all the files you want.  Otherwise, your local
RCPM will be the best bet.  I post a complete list each month of all
known RCPMs to net.micro.cpm.

If you are unable to access SIMTEL20 because of network restrictions
please remember that MOST of the new files announced to Info-Cpm are
also available on my RCPM Royal Oak (MI) which may be accessed at 300
bps using the 103a modem mode or 1200 bps using either the 212a or
Vadic 3400 modes.  The telephone number is (313) 759-6569.

I don't consider uucp netters to be "lowly".  In fact I try very hard
to make new pd files available to them either via netmail (if the
files are small enough) or by making space available on my RCPM for
requested files.  I have received many comments from uucp readers
thanking me to keeping them up-to-date on what's new in the CP/M
PD world.

NetLandians,
A recent conversation (re classified adds) mentioned a document (?)
called Netiquette .. first I'd heard of it.  Assume it's a Miss Manners
for net behavior/protocols/customs.

Can anyone point me to a copy?  I can FTP from my host if you'll set
the protection to read.

Thanks in advance,

Mark,

Suggest you get the files
COMDEMO.PAS
COMDEMO.DOC
CLIB180.DOC
CLIB180.INC
from DEC-MARLBORO.ARPA, directory TURBO:

(If you don't have FTP capabilities, yell and I can mail them to you.)
They discuss comm ports with Turbo Pascal in the CP/M environment and
provide a fairly full shell for a modem program.

Also TKERMIT.LBR in directory CPM.TURBOPAS at our beloved archive,
SIMTEL20.ARPA, has a full (well, a shell anyway) KERMIT that uses the
CP/M IOBYTE to check the serial port.  Nice sample code there too.
(Tho that's a little big for mailing).

So if you can't reach any of these thru your nets, yell.
Regards,

Keith,

	Thanks for your help.  I downloaded CPYFIL15.LBR and set it up on
my Rainbow at work.  I looked at the way you did it, and it looked similar
to what I tried.  I made some modifications to my program, but it still did
not help.  Then I tried your COM file as it is in the library, specifing
*.* to be copied.  It, also, only found the first file and quit (just like
my program).  It looks like I am not doing anything wrong, but the Rainbow
version of CP/M is acting funny.  Oh well!  I will have to try something
else, I guess (such as building a table of names or counting the number
done so far).

	Anyway, thanks again for your help.

PS:  I am sending a copy to INFO-CPM@AMSAA.  If anyone else has a Rainbow,
	try the MICRO:<CPM.FILCPY>CPYFIL15.LBR program and see if it works
	for you.

john,

i ordered the mix 'c' compiler about 3 weeks ago and it was shipped
( dated 10/15 ) to me this week. $45 including shipping. 

It appears to be a complete implementation of 'C' and has a large number
of unix-like and cpm-specific functions ( i.e. bdos/bios calls, chain ).

The manual is very large ( like a small telephone book ) and seems 
pretty good. It's loaded with examples ( about one example per 
item described ). The type-face stinks, though, and also the production
quality ( i.e. rather poor indexes. ) The manual compares to aztec, but that
might be as far as it goes. 

The compiler is quite slow, but appears to work ( for $40, the latter was
certainly in doubt. ) I tested it by compiling some xlisp source, and it
compiled without changes. It appears, though, that there are some kludges.
For example, to run an executable file you have to have a runtime
overlay on the disk, and the overlay ( that loads in the stdio package
) is loaded up ( slowly ) before the program runs. This seems artificial to
me. I should point out that a compiler option turns this off, but then one
isn't using i/o. 

The compiler in one pass creates an object file that can be passsed to the
linker.
Two utilities are provided that can be used before linking: a code speed
optimizer ( increases speed and code size ) and a code size optimizer 
( decreases size and speed ). I haven't had a chance to try these.

The code doesn't appear too fast, but i haven't tested it either with a
benchmark or by using the speedup utility. 

They do provide a full gamut of 'C' tools, from void constructs to
assigning structures to standard i/o functions. Also there is some source code
to some of the i/o functions ( fprintf, i think, etc ( ??? )).


Overall, I commend them on providing full K&R compatibility ( both the compiler
and the manual are highly compatible ). At this point I can't commend them
for runtime efficiency, nor for user interface ( as i would turbo pascal ).

However, for the price it is obviously excellent, especially given the
full K&R support ( including floats and longs, unix fns ( e.g. execl, execv,
printf, getc, etc )). 

For anyone on a budget, i recommend it, particularily for c novices
( there's a decent tutorial ). If you're rich, aztec is better, 
but maybe not for long. With several changes, this package could compete.
I should point out that it costs more for two books on 'C' than for this
compiler that includes a first-rate manual and is portable to many machines. 

Apple cpm users beware: 2 normal drives are not enough, unless you are fond of 
pulling floppies in and out of drives. A Unidisk 3.5 or a hard disk is
recommendable for this package, unless you have an editor that is smaller
than, say, wordstar. ( 30K ) One drive systems with less than 300K are out of
the question. However, it does work with 2 drives and 64k.

if anyone has specific questions, mail me and i'll try to answer them.

FIRST-TIME IMPRESSIONS ON MIX-C AND MIX EDITOR (CP/M  version):

The prominently advertised MIX C compiler is finally being shipped. Mine
arrived yesterday (two months late). I hope the delay means that version
1.0 is fully functional and has not been rushed to the marketplace. I'd
rather wait than be irate.

Mild irritation: I ordered COD and MIX didn't tell me that they instruct
UPS *not* to accept personal checks.

So far I haven't had time to really test the compiler. I did some
standard trivial stuff last night and MIX C performed. The documentation
is a large and thick softcover manual that includes an introduction to
the C language. It seemed well structured and clear, with enough
examples. According to the manual most default settings can be changed
by the user (where to look for overlays, etc.) and programs can be
optimized for either size or speed. The standard libraries can also be
changed. Creation of overlays seems fairly painless since the linker
they provide appears to be quite programmer-friendly.

My first impression with my new toy is very positive. For $39.95 it
seems like a bargain (unless I uncover some crippling bug tonight...)

I also ordered the MIX Editor and I tend to agree with the positive
reviews posted on this list. I like the ability to split my screen and
edit two files at a time. It is programmable so you can redefine your
keyboard or even write editor procedures. It certainly is more editing
power than I expected to ever have on my CP/M system.

Mike:

The Rainbow uses XON/XOFF protocol.

I have a Rainbow and LA50 and have had no problem, here is how my
switches are set:

SW1 0-8 open
SW2 0-6,8 open 7 closed

The above switch settings are the 'as shipped default settings' as shown
on the LA50 manual on page 13.

Hope this helps.

Hi; I picked up your note on this C compiler from the net.  I own an APPLE IIE

appreciate any information you may have on this subject, especially the

I tried sending this directly, but the mailer had some problems
w/ what I thought the address was, so re. the find/next problem:

If you can print the names properly, I would suggest COPYING
each name as find next finds them, then after all names have
been found use your list of file names to open each of them.

Gee, I used WATFOR in 1968 on an IBM 360.  They (Univ. of Waterloo) also
released in about that time frame WATFIV (WATerloo Fortran IV) and a
terrific Assembler.  I was very impressed with their compilers.

The Ampro can read 48TPI disks on 96TPI drives, and since Joe Wright wrote
the BIOS for the SB180 and is/was heavily involved in the Ampro software I
suspect the SB180 will also support this capability. Another solution is
to spend the $20 for a single sided 48TPI drive and use it as a spare for
compatibility purposes.

Subject: SB180 & Tandon half-height drives

You can get one Tandon half-height drive to work with a SB180 system
by jumpering it so that the drive is selected all the time.  It should
also be jumpered so that the 'Motor On' function is NOT controlled by
the drive selection, i.e., the seperate 'Motor On' signal line is
used.  Having the drive selected all the time precludes the use of
multiple drives.  There appears to be a strange timing incompatability
between the disk controller on the SB180 and the Tandon drives.  I
think I may have to peel the drive select lines coming out of the disk
controller off and run them into some special circuitry and then into
the Tandon drives to be able to use multiple drives.  For now, I at
least can boot ZRDOS and make back ups.  Be informed that the Tandon
drives don't support the READY line.  You must jumper the JP6
selection on the SB180.  I installed a switch on this jumper, so that
I can get to the SB180 monitor.  When JP6 is wired permanently, the
monitor thinks the drive is always ready, and thus tries to autoboot.
You can fix this be reburning a new monitor PROM, but I haven't gotten
around to this yet.

A 96tpi drive CAN read disks written on a 48tpi drive; the second part
of the construction article for that same SB180 implies as much.  The
BIOS needs some extra code to realize it must double-step for these
disk formats.  The major problem as I understand it is that in writing,
the 96tpi drive lays down a narrower 'track' than the 48tpi drive (makes
sense), which may either get lost against a previously written 'wide'
track if the disk has been used before in a 48tpi drive, or simply be
too narrow for the 48tpi drive's head to get a useful signal from.

Hope this helps.

Subject: MIX editor
To: info-cpm@AMSAA.ARPA
Message-ID: <COR-ACB-7X34O@OFFICE-1>

Based on the recent interest in MIX C and Editor, I would like to reask a 
question I posted earlier.  Just after posting I lost my network connection due
to a change in address.  So I repeat the questions.  Sorry if I cause much 
repeating of answers.

Is the MIX editor written in Turbo?

I ask because the MIX editor does not run on my system and I want to avoid 
buying the language that it was written in.  Why does it not run you ask?  My 
system runs with interrupts active so that I can have console type ahead.  The 
MIX editor does everything but work with interrupts active.  Either the run 
time code is mismanaging the stack (say by fetching values from the stack 
"below" the stack pointer) or switching stacks and not leaving room for entries
caused by interrupts. I have no trouble if I run without interrupts.  I guessed
at Turbo because of the strange run time error messages I got about heaps and 
stacks that printed out when I tried it with interrupts enabled.

Other comments about MIX are that it is reasonably powerful.  I got it to 
behave like Magic Wand (my favorite editor) and its macro capability seems very
nice (especially for the price).  It is, however, VERY slow and VERY large 
(medium level languages have this problem).  Even with tons of overlays only a 
16K buffer is left on my 59K Northstar system (Magic Wand leaves over 40K).

I got it because it handles split screens and was programmable.  I will 
probably use it for those tasks that require those features.  Must be a lot 
better with bigger memories and faster CPU's.  Is writing fast, compact, and 
powerful code a lost art?

Unified Software Systems of New Carrollton, MD has made the $35 sampler
version of their FORTH-83 CP/M-80 product available on bulletin boards
on the west coast and Florida.  The system is a precompiled version of
the full product, sans sources, fancy doc, and certain bells & whistles.

Has anybody run across it, and if so, WHERE ?!

Much grass.

P.S.> They also have the same product available for sundry micros and the
VAX.  I am in no way affliated with them, nor is this supposed to be an
ad, I just wanted to share the knowledge and find the sampler on a BBS.
It's supposed to live in a couple of squeezed libraries.  I do use their
VAX product and like it.

The following message I sent apparently got lost by the mailer so I am
resending it. Please note that I have since received MIX-C and sent a
preliminary review to this group. Again, my personal feeling from what I
have had a chance to check out is that MIX-C is the best deal in
low-price C compilers, being fully K&R compatible.

----- Forwarded message # 1:

Think twice about getting BDS C: it may compile very fast, but it is
non-standard enough to make porting a pain. If you have no intention of
ever recompiling your code on another system that's fine, otherwise...

More standard low price compilers for CP/M are C/80 with Mathpak
(produces very efficient code) and Q/C (comes with source code!) among
others. MIX C was been prematurely anounced at $39.95 three months ago
and they aren't shipping yet (hmm...).

Check the C compiler reviews in Dr. Dobbs, Byte and Computer Language
for some very complete info.

Be sure to check out the MIX C compiler.  When I called in my VISA order about
4 weeks ago, the CPM-80 version was ~3 weeks from shipping, seems they wanted to
update it to include features they'd added to the IBM-PC version.  I received
the CPM-80 version last week along with a very excellent manual.  The tutorial
is the best written introduction to C that I've found and I've looked at and/or
purchased many.  Now if the compiler is anywhere near as good as the manual...

I have just succeeded in getting a development environment that will allow
me to assemble large ASM programs for my CP/M system (Apple II based, small
floppies).  I am interested in upgrading my file transfer software to a
version more recent than MDM712, which is what I have been running.  I do
have MDM740, but not an example of the newer format overlay file for modem
configuration or phone number definition.  I also do not have the M7LIB
or M7FNK programs.
	A)  Does anyone have the files I am missing?
	B)  Is there a more recent / better file transfer program for
	    which source is available (ASM or BDS-C) that supports
	    CRC/Batch mode?  Can I get it?
Thanks much.

                               Is CP/M-80 dead?

                  Fun in buying TurboPascal for my NorthStar


     When Adam Osborne was asked if he saw any future in CP/M-80 at a recent
seminar I attended, his answer was short and to the point: "None.  Next
Question?"

     Of course everyone laughed at that and I even kinda aggreed with the
statement.  While I thought that CP/M-80 would never actually die, it probably
would become a secondary option to IBM in small machines.  Then I tried to get
a discount copy of TurboPascal for my NorthStar Horizon running N* CP/M.

     Those that have organic memories going back a couple months remember a
want notice I posted on "Wanna buy TurboPascal for CP/M-80."  To all that
replied, thank you; I was surprised at the response.  Of the thirty or so
replies:

     - about half recommended going directly to Borland and buying it at the
retail of $69,
     - the other half contained various suggestions, some good, some not so
good.  There were two recommendations for "Spite Software" in, I think,
Washington State and two for "The Programmers's Shop" in Maine.
     - I even got several offers for pirate copies.

     All-in-all it took me about four weeks to actually receive a copy.  I
think I tried just about *all* of the 800 numbers in most of the popular
computer magazines.  The results of this informal survey in the basis for the
title of this note:  4/5ths of those called only offered MS-DOS software - the
other 1/5 would order CP/M stuff for a two to four week delay.  Only one had
it in stock and only one copy at that.  The magic words were *IBM*compatible*.
Yes, I knew that most micros sold are Irish Barf Models, but several sales-
people even asked if CP/M-80 was *IBM* *compatible*!  sheesh.
 
     I ended up buying the in-stock copy from the Programmers Shop and got it
10-14 days later.  (The guys there knew what CP/M was - and even asked the
right questions about disk format without prompting.)  A good place to deal
with.

     Through a bit of stupidity on my part, I actually brought and paid for
TWO copies, the other from a local dealer.  When one gets desperate and mad
one makes bad decisions.  (Anyone need a [factory-sealed] of Turbo copy for
CP/M?  And no, Frank, this is not an ad!)  The sum result was that my effort
to get a fast cheaper copy by going through mail-order backfired by being even
slower and more expensive.  My recommendation: buy directly from Borland.

     All-in-all, Osborne's comment kept coming back to me - despite CP/M-plus,
Echelon, ZCPR3, SB180, Richard Conn (sorry Rich), the dedication of thousands
of hackers, and the archives of Simtel20, CP/M *is* dying.  Even Digital
Research is no longer supporting it!  (That might not be a big loss though.)

     Is there anything we can (or should) be doing about that?  I just bought
an new z80 s-100 (N*) box - is it obsolete even before I pay it off?  The cost
to convert it to the magic IBM-compatible cost more than a separate new Irish
Barf Model PC.  Are we all going to go the way of the TI99a people?  And if we
go, aren't the 6502 Apple hackers right behind?  Or in front?

     As the cheerleaders say: 'Lets hear some *NOISE*!'

Anybody have any recommendations for an accounting and a database
package which runs on CP/M and which would serve the needs of a church?
The accounting package would have to handle the sorts of financial data
one would expect for a church operation and the database would have to
handle membership and mailing lists.  Simple user interfaces are
naturally a premium consideration.

Bob,

Enjoyed your trials narrative better than you probably enjoyed the trials!
Wish I had an answer to the fading popularity of CP/M .. I'm sitting here
with my good and faithful Toad (Morrow Decision I, S100) and the stolid and
mysterious Beast (CompuPro S100 multi-user with Gifford MP/M 816), yet all
my most recent developmental work is in the flashy Gulfstream..
NOT because it's a better programming environment (ugh), but only because
(1) that's where the markets are
(2) bloody people seem to want flash out there (e.g., popup windows,
    fancy screens, everything at their fingertips at the same time but
    "don't expect ME to read a manual", etc.

Sigh ...

[The memory queue pushed this one out the back...]

At some point in the recent past, on one of the several (many)
RCP/M systems I'm involved with, I saw a library with a program
to do disk transfers/reads/something between CP/M and RT/11.

Now a friend of mine with an RT/11 system has expressed an interest in it,
and I can't find it!!!

Since it was a CP/M program, I'm assuming that it was good only for
reading RT/11 files into CP/M.  Fine, I'll take what I can get.

I don't have ARPA access, but I check these RCP/M systems fairly often:
	Lillipute:	(312) 649-1730	(Chicago)
	Voorhees:	(609) 428-8864	(Southern NJ)

Plus there's always my uucp address, which I'm hoping will show up
with my .signature - oh, what the heck, I'll risk it being here twice...

Subject: Is CP/M Dead (or) Turbo buy fun

Bob,

First, let's clarify one point: if you judge the vitality of an
operating system, or anything else for that matter, on the basis of
vendor support, then there are many popular, but dead products out
there.

In the case of CP/M and DRI, it was CP/M-Plus that was put out to
pasture under the heading of Level "D" support "for mature products
that are not actively supported".  CP/M 2.2 (CP/M-80) has been
assigned Level "C" support, which is limited to questions submitted on
CompuServe and phone calls.

Now, that is not as good as Level "B" ("active support", meaning
they'll eventually answer letters, too) nor Level "A".  But, it's not
dead, or in the "mature" catagory as far as DRI is concerned.

Of course, the counter argument is that CP/M-80 was never supported by
DRI in the first place.  Ever try to call in the early days and get an
answer?

Just because Adam Osborne says there's no future in CP/M-80 doesn't
mean that it is dead.  There's a difference.  The market for CP/M is
simply mature and mostly saturated.  If you're going to write
software, don't bother writing for CP/M - write for the hungry mass
market that's still trying to catch up with the rest of us using
tight, functional, and efficient programs.  There's a future and a
fortune there, not in CP/M.

There are about maybe 2 million CP/M users out there, many of them
perfectly content with what they have and don't need anything else.
See Jerry Pournelle's column this month for one, possibly prevelant
viewpoint, at least among us diehards, and note that Jerry has a
choice.

To anyone who has/is using a Compupro 10+ micro with CCPM/8-16:

  I have been using a 10+ for several weeks now, and have become
exasperated with the Compupro documentation (or lack of). 
If there is anyone out there who has done system level programming
on this machine, I would like to talk to you concerning some very basic yet 
undocumented features/commands.  For example:

	- How does one reset the real time clock.  The documentation
	  mentions the following: 
		   A>  DATE SET
	  But that does not seem to work.

	- The 10+ supports several printers, yet it is not documented
	  anywhere how to access them and switch printers from within
	  a program (assembly language, Pascal, C, etc..)

	- The operating system seems to have a bug concerning the 
	  release of the printers.  When more than one user tries to 
	  print a document to a common printer from within a program 
	  (i.e. Wordstar, Dbase), the second user's program seems to 
	  hang until the first users exits his program (back to the
	  system prompt).

	- Is it possible to detach the console as in MP/M, to run
	  a background task with CCP/M 8-16?

Also, if anyone has any hardware reference manuals for the machine, 
I would also like to find out how the communications are done between
the Z80`s and the 8088 CPU/Disk Drives.

I have made several attempts to contact D.R.I., the dealer where I
bought the system, and even Compupro to get some of these answers
but all in vain.  Any help in an of the above topics is appreciated.

Message-ID: <428@sii.UUCP>

To:       info-cpm@AMSAA.ARPA

I also got my MIX C compiler a week or two ago and agree with all the
positive things that have been said about it here.  It seems to be
an excellent buy for $39.95 (or $45 with COD)-  it comes with a thick
paperback-book manual with C tutorial, reference, and lots of examples
(there are some errors in the examples so the proofreading may not have
been great).  The compiler can produce listing files. The linker supports
libraries-- you manipulate a library by converting it to an ASCII form and
editing it!  The linker can deal with either the ASCII or binary form (it
appears that the binary form has an awful lot of overhead in it, but no
matter there).  Multiple overlay areas are supported, which is nice on
a CPM80 system.

On the negative side:

	- the linker seems incredibly picky.  If you don't give it the
	  commands in the right sequence, you can get a fatal error message
	  or, worse yet, your program simply won't work.

	- you can define multiple overlay regions in your program, but
	  each region is a fixed size and must be big enough for the largest
	  overlay you are going to put in there.  I would much rather see
	  a hierarchical overlay structure, where overlay boundaries depend
	  on the definition of the higher-level overlay.  But again, for
	  $40 this is great.

	- The minimum program size seems to be about 24K.  This is because
	  the compiler generates intermediate code; an interpreter occupies
	  the first 20K or so of every program.  This interpreter does not
	  have to be linked with the program, so the file size can be small,
	  but in this case you have to have the runtime overlay hanging around
	  on your disc in order to run your programs.

	- There is no mechanism for linking assembler programs to the C
	  programs.  There *is* a mechanism for calling assembler programs,
	  though, if you want to load or initialize code into memory
	  somewhere, you can call it.  Kind of like the Atari notion of
	  a BASIC-Assembler interface.

	- The compiler matches reserved words in either-case mode;  you
	  CAN NOT turn this off.  That is, the reserved word "int" can
	  be given as "int", "Int", "INT", etc.  This is the only thing
	  that I think they did really Wrong.

I bought because I hoped that since it generates intermediate code, it would
compile some large programs to fit into my CPM80 system better.  I haven't
proved or disproved this notion yet, but given the horrible code produced
by the Aztec and Ecosoft compilers that I have, I don't doubt that there
is a size threshold above which programs compiled with MIX will be smaller
than with those others. All in all, it seems to be a great buy, especially
if you don't care about speed.

About the MIX editor: I'll restate what I said several months ago.  MIX
seems to have done a great job with this too, but (as with the compiler)
they made one thing Wrong: the editor doesn't deal with control characters.
Like formfeeds and tabs!!  So for me, the editor is useless.  The folks
at MIX say they are going to fix this-- I hope so, because the editor looks
really nice.

Why can't the gateway be moderated?  This is being done for a lot of
ARPAnet groups as we watch (read net.announce).  The moderator would be
able to forward only those articles from net.micro.cpm that s/he felt were
appropriate.  Needless to say, there is probably much less that originates
on the ARPAnet that  net.micro.cpm readers would be offended by, but that
could be deleted too.

Rick Thomas

PS  I would volunteer to do the moderation, if somebody would fix me up
with an account on an ARPAnet machine that I could get to via a local phone
call...

I don't think that a moderated system is the answer to the problem. 
On the Xerox system we don't get many (we get a few but not enough to
bothersome) ads because we have mailing lists intended for them a-
lone. There is a JunkMail and WantAds list for those who are interested
in receiving the mail. This is probably the best solution, because it
keeps all parties satisfied.

I spent a lot of time and energy trying to find a package similar to what you
have described for my synagogue (there are a lot of similarities between
a church and synagogue package.)  Bottom line was that the one's I found
were generally written for MS/PC-DOS and that the affordable ones ($2,500 or
less) weren't very good.  (My congregation felt they couldn't afford more
than $2,500.  There are some packages for $3,000 and more but I didn't
bother to look.)

Since there is a market for a relatively good package at a reasonable price,
I decided to write one.  (Maybe I should say integrate one.)  I am using 
the Micro Business Applications (MBA) Accountant Series (G/L, A/P, A/R)
and dBaseIII.  I am using dBase for membership data (Name, address, phone #,
children's names, birthdates, youth group activity) and for some billing 
data.  I am writting some dBase code generate some monthly, quarterly,
semi-annual and annual billing data.  This data is passed to the MBA A/R
for statement generation, account aging, and G/L posting.  Since we have
about 50 employees (school teachers, custodians, office staff) we are using
MBA's payroll system.  (It passes data to the G/L).

All of the MBA software was originally written for CP/M-80 systems and was
then ported to PC/MS-DOS.  It has a pretty-good user interface and the 
documentation is really complete.  I chose dBaseIII for two reasons:
the "Assist" program makes it easier for the novice to generate queries,
reports and address labels; and the MBA software included a conversion
utility to go between the MBA files and dBase II/III.  I am not suggesting
that my choices were the best; they just seem to work fairly well and 
you can't ask for much more.

Hope this was helpful.

To: info-cpm@AMSAA.ARPA

I join those who believe in CP/M.  Not that it is the greatest etc, but because
it is functional, simple, and predictable.  I have done some rather 
sophisitcated things for CP/M including POP UP windows and ThinkTank like 
things.  But people are killing it.  The users are killing it.  How?

Simple.  As a commercial CP/M developer and vendor I find that it is nearly 
impossible to find any publication read by the "2 million" CP/M users.  While 
there are many publications that CP/M users read most of them are dominated by 
"IBM" users.  Advertising rates are based on total circulation and thus 
advertising for the 3% of the CP/M readers is prohibitive.  This applies to 
distributors as well who must examine their advertising costs.  So since the 
publishers killed off the likes of Microsystems there is no central place to 
advertise new CP/M software.

I am sorry if that sounds like a very commercial reason and I would surely 
appreciate feedback.  I find it frustrating.  CP/M users should rally behind 
some publication and boost its readership to 500,000 CP/M readers.  That ought 
to create the atmosphere for developers to reach the "2 million" users.

I think Alan's message raises a matter of great concern to the users of CPM...
there simply is no magazine that deals principally with CPM matters and hence
can create a forum for information exchange concerning it.

I was startled to learn recently that KayPro's magazine Profiles, with 100,000
circulation is that largest magazine appealing mostly to CPM users and it is
undergoing an identity crisis since KayPro is no selling MS-DOS based
computers.

Dave,

I think you're pretty much right, at least for us unrepentant and
unreconstructed hackers.  But for my wife, DOS is better, because the
bigger memory space of a 16 bit system makes for "friendlier" programs.
And my wife is part of that great mass market that will buy a machine
with 3 initials on it because they feel good about those three initials
(beats me why, with Compupro's around, but that's another story).  

Even CP/M 86, had it caught on, would have been better than CP/M 80 for
this reason.  

If Gary Kildall made only one mistake, it was in putting work into an
8-bit operating system, and not the 16 -bit version.  Thus, he wasn't
ready when IBM *wanted* to use CP/M 86.

Sigh ...

For those looking for a publication to rally behind consider MicroCornucopia
of Bend (I think) Oregon.  I've been reading it since issue#1 and think it is
great.  It too is suffering from what's next but has not made any firm 
decisions.  It looks like a good place to advertize since it is a Z80 (+others)

Regarding Borland Modula-II, I called them last week after a long

This is the beta, not the release.

An aside, re the 'is CPM dead -- when I said I wanted mine on 8" CPM,
I got a long pause!  Then 'Can you read anything else?'  Alas...

Hello, Bob,

	"Is CP/M Dead?" is a matter of perspective, as I see it.  It also
depends on what you mean by "Dead."  I offer the following:

Meaning of "Is CP/M Dead?"			Answer to "Is CP/M Dead?"
--------------------------			-------------------------
1. Is anyone making commercial software 	No, CP/M is not dead; there
 packages for CP/M now?				 are many new commercial
						 packages out there (1)

2. Are the majority of the users of all		I don't know, but I think
 microcomputers running CP/M?			 50/50 chance that IBM has
						 not reached 2 Million users;
						 but how many old CP/M users
						 switched to IBM?

3. Are new users of microcomputers buying	Yes, the new users are largely
 CP/M systems (counting derivatives)?		 buying IBM, so CP/M is dying
 (this refers to personal computer users)	 if not already dead

4. Are total sales of new microcomputers	I don't know, but I am aware
 leaning toward CP/M (counting derivatives)?	 of many, many embedded micros
 (this refers to PCs and embedded computers)	 running CP/M et al

5. Is the flow of public domain CP/M software	No, as is evidenced by the
 stopping?					 latest SIG/M releases I saw
						 today, CP/M is still thriving

6. Where is the majority of the public domain	No, CP/M is not dead; looking
 software?					 at the libraries, CP/M is
						 first, IBM is second; but how
						 do the "good/junk" ratios
						 compare?

------------

	So, the above sums up my response to your question.  If you look
at the "new user" community, the answer is what you expected - Yes, CP/M is
dead since the majority of new PC users are not buying it (my meaning 3 above).
There are lots of applications, especially embedded applications, where a Z80
running CP/M is a marvelous, simple, and cheap solution (try embedding an IBM
PC in a communications controller, if you see what I mean).  In the other
four categories, the issue is not at all clear.  CP/M (and the Z System)
is certainly alive as I see it.

	As for myself, I am running ZCPR3/ZRDOS and do not intend to switch
at home.  This combination meets my needs nicely.  At work, I use TIPCs
(IBM workalikes), and I have no complaints, but I don't do anything there
that I can't do at home.  I write code in assembly language and C at home,
and exclusively in C at work (except on the VAX, where I write exclusively
in Ada, and the VAX 11/785 makes a nice PC when working with Ada).

	My next hardware move is to upgrade to an S-100, 64180 board
(one is out now).  I plan to follow that with more software, particularly
a multi-tasking ZCPR4 with a large TPA.  After that, I will probably move
to a good, very fast UNIX system (68020, 32032 class).  Essentially, I plan
to skip the IBM PC market entirely ... if I need a powerful processor, I'll
go with one backed by a good operating system.

	For further discussions, see Jerry Pournelle's column in the
November "Byte" and the "Of Interest" column by Alex Ragen in the November
"Dr. Dobb's Journal."  Quoted from Alex' column:

	"Electronic Business, a magazine devoted to the dollars and
cents issues of the computer business, recently published a long article
analyzing the microprocessor market.  It carried the surprising message
that 8-bit processors make up by far the lion's share of that market,
with 16-bit processors trailing far behind.  Moreover, most industry
observers expect this situation to continue for many years.  The reason
is that the now inexpensive 8-bit processors and their peripherals are
perfectly adequate for most applications.  Where 16-bit processors hold
sway is in the prestige conscious world of the personal computer, where
only the latest fashion is marketable."

   In response to the "Is CPM dead issue", Consider the quality of newer
programs and tools coming out now.  This little OS and its derivative,
ZRDOS, are really entering maturity.  EFFICIENT tools are becoming avail-
able as evidenced by newer languages like Modula-2, which in the case of a
recent issue of Computer Languages (I think) comparing a pre-release of
Borland's Modula-2, Hochstrasser's Modula-2 (Which I use, and distributed
by Workman & Associates in the US), and three systems for MS-DOS.  The 8-
bitters under CPM compared VERY favorably to the MS-DOS systems.

   The ease of tailoring CP/M systems to specific applications while not
destroying compatibility should not be overlooked.  I have a system that
adapts to nearly any disk format by coding the disk layout on track 0,
sector 1 in single-density.  I can therefore play around with things like
skew factors and physical sector sizes.  Why be locked into 4.5 kb per
track on a 5"disk when room exists for a full 5 k per track.  The Ampro
little boards and SB-180 can provide very graphic examples of high-perfor-
mance systemsd managed by a flexible and capable OS like CP/M.

   A while ago, a round-table discussion occured here on the "ideal CP/M
environment".  I contend that the current state of CP/M has advanced even
more in the past year.  The problem, as one contributor mentioned, is that
the information is not getting out to the masses.  Consider the following:

        DateStamper - Adds real-time or pseudo-time and date capability to
                CP/M systems.  It stays resident after loading and occupies
                less than 1k.  I have used it  for quite a while in both
                below CCP and above-BIOS locations, and have found NO glitches.

        Mix Editor - I don't have this program, but the ads say it supports
                split-screen and dual-file editting, such as the touted
                "cut-and-paste" capability of "larger" machines.

        Hochstrasser Modula-2 - Very efficient code generation, adaptable
                to run-time CP/M machine, supports shared data areas needed
                for overlays, chaining, etc.

        Dazzlestar - Available from Simtel20.  Screen-oriented disassembler.
                This is an amazingly friendly disassembler, with a non-standard
                .MAC output format, but very capable.

   Eventually, I am sure that knowledge of MS-DOS may be required, but I keep
hoping that something offering the flexibility, capability, and efficiency of
CP/M will displace it before that time.  (Hope springs eternal...etc).
                Hal

Another possible rallying point for CP/Mers is the First Osborne
Group's FOGHORN.  While there is obviously a noticeable Osborne
bias, most of what is presented is plain vanilla CP/M application
stuff.  I seem to remember its current circulation is around
20,000, and it attracts a large number of CP/M advertisers.  I've
used much of the stuff in there on both my Osborne and on my two
H89's.

Most of the Osborne and Kaypro and generic software should run on the
C128.
When you order SW specify the Osborne or Kaypro formats the 128 can read
both.

I have a DEC Rainbow and wrote out XLISP on Osborne format for a friend
with a C128 and it worked fine.

DEARC.PQS, a generic Turbo V3 routine which unpacks .ARC files, (ARC
is a utility widely used on FIDO bulletin boards to pack files
together), has been uploaded to SIMTEL20 as:

Filename			Type	 Bytes	 CRC

Directory MICRO:<CPM.TURBOPAS>
DEARC.PQS.1			BINARY	 11904  89D3H

Up to now, we CPM people have been stuck having to skip any .ARC
files. No longer!!!! The utility should be compiled and run passing
the .ARC filename as the p1 parameter.

I have downloaded it into the NICBUL RBBS system.  You can also call
(608) 273-5037 between 6pm to 8am M-F or all day on weekends CST.
Baud rate is 300/1200/2400.

File you will need is:
	YMODEM.ARC

If you don't have the arc program, get:
	ARC430.EQE
	ARC430.DQC

Someone also upload a YAM demo program:
	YAMDEMO2.ARC

When you call the system use USE as the first name, NET as the last name
and UUCP as the password.  That will give you plenty of time to download
all of the programs (at 1200 or 2400). 

I am the SYSOP, so if you have any problems, let me know, either here or on
the BBS.

Help...  I just found an add from a company that has an 8" floppy controller
for the Apple for $29.95!!  I called the toll free number and the guy says
that he has a controller with schematic but no software.  The board uses
a WD1793 controller chip and has CORVUS etched on the board.  He also says
that all calls by others to CORVUS produced the response of "Never heard of
a 8" controller board for the Apple".  Anyway, does anyone have any experience
with writing drivers for the Apple and PCPI CP/M??  I might take a chance
for 30 bucks if I knew I could get some help with the software.
                              Thanks in advance

I am posting this message for a friend.  Mail responses to me at

  We are having a problem with Perfect Filer running on a Kaypro with
a 10M hard disk.  When we delete a record, the index goes away as it 
should. However, the record is still in the database, and is printed 
when we print our reports.  We have tried to get around this temporarily
by creating a 'deleted' field in the record, but the 'deleted' records 
still take up space (of course) and there seems to be no way of copying
only selected records from one database to another.
  Any ideas on what we are missing (or the program is lacking), or 
suggestions on ways to get around this (a BASIC program maybe?) would
be greatly appreciated.

   Thanks for your help!    Mike Blackwell

I would like very much to get hold of a ram disk program for the

(I know about RAMDISK for MS-DOS.)

Subject: SD102 Super Directory program now available

The latest verion of SD, the "Super Directory" program, is now
available from SIMTEL20 as:

Filename			Type	 Bytes	 CRC

Directory MICRO:<CPM.DIRUTL>
SD102.LBR.1			BINARY	 77952  BCA1H

SD displays the directory of a CP/M disk, sorted alphabetically, with
the file size in k, rounded to the nearest CP/M block size.  Also
displays library files with the file size in k if the '$L' option is
used.  This version can be assembled with ASM, LASM, MAC, RMAC or M80.

Latest revision:

10/31/85  Fixed bug which caused system to crash if BYE low (LOWCCP)
  v102    and using disk options (DOPT EQU YES).  Thanks to Wayne
          Masters for reporting it.
                                        - Keith Petersen, W8SDZ

Current versions of SD automatically adjust for any block size and
directory length under CP/M 1.4 or 2.x or MP/M (any version).  They
also automatically adjust for any number of disk drives and work
satisfactorily even if no disk is in that drive at the moment.
Provisions are made for:

        (1) automatic pauses when the screen fills up
        (2) searching individual or multiple drives and/or user areas
        (3) unconditional or optional resetting the disk system before
            execution begins
        (4) directing output to a disk file called SD.DIR and appending
            to that file on subsequent runs
        (5) summary line output giving drive and user information,
            number of files matched and how much space they consume,
            and the amount of free space remaining on the disk
        (6) displaying or suppressing "system" files
        (7) accepting ambiguous filenames with or without a drive name
        (8) printer output
        (9) optional help menu with $?

Previous revisions:

10/28/85  Added an equate to allow display of file attributes only in
  v101    inverse video.  This leaves the header line in normal video
          and avoids that bright band on the screen.  Also, with the
          THREBYT equate set, the third byte was written to the disk
          when the F option was active.  This mod fixes that problem.
                                        - Barron McIntire

07/24/85  Rewrote the TIMEON code to allow use of the existing time-
  v100    on-system data contained in BYE5, BYE3, BYE+ or MBYE's RTC
          buffer.  If TIMEON is YES, SD merely reports "Time on system
          is nnn minutes" and makes no attempt to log the user off.
          Logoff responsibility is delegated to the (M)BYE(+) program.
          TIMEON checks to see if BYE is running and continues without
          reporting time-on if not.  No installation required to use
          this feature if you have clock code installed in your BYE.
          All page-1 equates previously used by TIMEON were deleted.
          This update also contains the SD99.FIX code for nested IF'
                                        - Wayne Masters, Potpourri

07/11/85  Added THREBYT equate for systems needing a 3-byte sequence
  v99     for reverse video.    If THREBYT is YES then the value coded
          at TBYTE is added to the reverse video sequence (currently
          set for a Kaypro).  Also added a new "?" option which will
          display a menu of the $ options available if HELP is YES.
                                        - Steve Sanders

03/15/85  Fixes obscure display bug which deletes display of 1, 2 or
  v98     3 file names in 3 out of 4 cases when the directory has
          >255 entries.  The fix code was written by Peter Lyman.
                                        - Paul Foote

01/21/85  Added support for ZRDOS.  Although CP/M compatible, ZRDOS
  v97     does not allow the SWAPEM technique of poking local values
          into the operating system.   Instead, a test for ZRDOS is
          made and, if present, further calls to CPM: set the Warm
          Boot Trap in ZRDOS.  On any error detected by ZRDOS the
          trap is reset and control is passed to DSKERR:  No equates
          need be changed for CPM/ZRDOS, testing is dynamic in the
          run-time code.
