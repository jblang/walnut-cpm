Turned on my Otrona Attache with the keyboard not connected and ever since
it fails in this way.  With power on there is no monitor prompt for disks.
Disks don't boot.  The drive lights glow faintly while power is on and flash
as power is turned off.

Does this grand little computer have much chance at another life?  I replaced
the button battaries but have no test point docs.  Neither do the local fixers.

Please reply with mail.

   Well, I have overcome one part of the problem I was having getting MEX to
run on someone's Sanyo 1250, and now I face the next phase.

   Someone pointed out that there was a superbly written MEX overlay for the
Sanyo 1250 sitting right on my own Z-Node BBS!  I had not recognized it
because it used the ID letters SN instead of SY.

   Now the trouble is that the screen codes are all messed up.  That overlay,
I guess, includes only the modem-control-hardware overlay and not the
terminal overlay.  So, now I want to ask if anyone has a terminal overlay for
the Sanyo 1250 or, lacking that, a complete set of screen codes.  Someone
already gave me the basic ones.  Does it support any graphics characters?

FAQ file? Hmmm, that's a novel idea. I don't think this group has seen 
one in a while. ;-)

As to your other question: UNARC16.COM is a self-extracting file that can 
then extract from *.ARC and *.ARK files. ARK11.ARK gives full 
functionality -- it can make, update, extract. The results are fully SEA 
and PKARC (oops!) compliant. Note: *.ARC and *.ARK files are identical in
structure. The difference in the extension is only to highlight files of 
interest to CPMers (the *.ARK).

Jeff Wieland added to my comments about using DI/EI around code that must not
be interrupted:

>> Shouldn't this code be examining the current interrupt state before it
>> goes changing them?

Yes, it certainly SHOULD.  However, as you noted yourself, it may not be
possible in operating-system code, which runs under severe memory
constraints.  This is something I will certainly look into (thanks for the
exact TCJ references).

My guess is that the problem does not affect very many people.  This was the
first report of any problem, though, of course, this is not always a good
indicator.  I am always amazed at how quick people are to blame software
problems on themselves rather than on the author (where it belongs), and
terrible bugs sometimes sit unreported for long periods of time.

This OS is described fully in the following book:

	THEOS/OASIS User's Handbook
	by Walter C. Stagner Jr.
	Weber Systems, Inc.
	8437 Mayfield Road
	Chesterland, Ohio 44026
	ISBN 0-938862-00-6   1985

As of 1985 THEOS was distributed by THEOS Software Company. 
The former distributor was Phase One systems.  I don't know if
they are still in business. no address is given in the book.

There is also reference to a THEOS User's Group:

	Fred Bellomy
	THEOS User's Group
	PO Box 2400
	Santa Barbara, CA 93120
	805/965-0265

The book lists the following implementations:

	Seiko 16-bit systems, apparently including much application
	software and a "CP/M Adapter" to run CP/M programs.

	ALTOS

	IBM PC/XT

	ONYX 186D (apparently a primary platform)

	Advanced Digital Super System II

Presumably the OS could be obtained (as of 1985) through the hardware
vendors.  Again, no addresses are given.

I have a Z80 disassembler written in C (should be quite portable).
I run it under unix on a sparc and feed it intel hex files sucked out
of roms by my prom burner.  It would be easy to modify it to accept
other kinds of input (and to run on other systems).

Anybody that wants it, let me know.

Subject: CP/M on an Apple II
Message-ID: <1992Mar23.151028.13651@meaddata.com>

I run CP/M on an Apple //e with a Microsoft Premium Softcard //e installed.
This card is a 6 MHz Z80 coprocessor, 64K memory expansion, and 80-column
combination card that fits the AUX slot of the Apple //e.  However, I'm in
the process of migrating to an Apple IIgs, which doesn't have an AUX slot.
I'd like to know if there is a high-speed Z80 card that will work in one of
the standard slots of the IIgs, preferably without disabling the built-in
function of the slot or slowing down the system speed.  I've heard of an
"AppliCard" (or something like that), but don't know anything about it or
where I can get one.  I'd consider buying such a card from someone, or
trading the Softcard for it and a normal 64K/80-column card for the //e.
Thanks!

I have some information on OASIS and the company that still (as of a year or
so ago) supports it.  I'm sure that there were a number of S-100 machines 
that it was ported to, but the only one that I know of first hand was by
NNC (so called No Name Computer) Electronics in the L.A. area.  OASIS, of 
itself, was a multiuser operating system, rather in the vein of MP/M.  I 
think that THEOS was rather more the PC compatible implementation of OASIS.
I need to dig out some information from a text that I have, and will e-mail
it to you.

I've lost the manual.  Could someone who remembers, or

Subject: Hard disk for S-100, CP/M
Message-ID: <2787@dove.nist.gov>

I have an S-100 based CP/M system. It's purely home-brew, and I can't 
get rid of it since there's too much effort invested in special-purpose
boards I've built for it. I would like to put a hard disk on it. It has
a 10 MHz 80186 CPU.

Does anyone have a reccomendation for a controller card? Does anyone make
them for S-100? Does anyone know how to interface a PC controller card to
S-100?

Thanks for any help.

Not to steal any of Ed's thunder, but MIX C for CP/M may also be ordered from
MIX software themselves.  Just look for any POWER C ad to get their address/
phone #.

Make sure you say that you want the CP/M version.

Shouldn't this code be examining the current interrupt state before it
goes changing them?  I mean, if interrupts aren't enabled, it should
detect this and not enable them when it gets through the critical
section of the code.

Bridger Mitchell had some examples for doing this in The Computer
Journal, Vols. 36 & 37.  Be sure to see both articles, because the
second has a work-around for a Z80 that the code in the first article.
Specifically, if an interrupt occurs while your code is checking the
interrupt status, the Z80 will wrongly report that interrupts are 
disabled.

On the other hand, the code to do this might not fit, either in the
Type 4 header or in the command processor.

Disks don't boot.  The drive lights glow faintly while power is on and flash

FAQ file? Hmmm, that's a novel idea. I don't think this group has seen 
one in a while. ;-)

As to your other question: UNARC16.COM is a self-extracting file that can 
then extract from *.ARC and *.ARK files. ARK11.ARK gives full 
functionality -- it can make, update, extract. The results are fully SEA 
and PKARC (oops!) compliant. Note: *.ARC and *.ARK files are identical in
structure. The difference in the extension is only to highlight files of 
interest to CPMers (the *.ARK).

  They are neither.  They are single-sided, 96tpi drives ... about

Thanks, Bill! It's likely that Televideo used similar tricks on 
the whole line of their CP/M machines ... worth running with 
anyway :-)  Are there particular bit patterns used to swap in and

It should.  To that end, I reviewed the files at SIMTEL20 under CP/M-86
and drew a blank.  The only thing they appeared to have was an Un-Sqeeze
program, which sounded like the opposite from what you wanted.

There is a possibility that you might want to explore, if you are not
successful in getting one directly.  That is to get the source for an
8080/Z80 compression program and translate it to 8086 compatible source
code and assemble it for your use.  To that end, following are a couple
of directory and file cites from SIMTEL20 that could be used in that
way.

Directory PD2:<CPM.SQUSQ>
CRNCH24S.LBR  B   97536  880218  Source for Cruncher/Uncruncher

Directory PD2:<CPM.ASMUTL>
XLT86.LBR     B   83584  850916  8080 to 8086 source code translator

It is possible that you might have to create some macros to convert Z80
instructions into something that the 8086 can do, but that should be the
only major stumbling block.

As a point of curiousity, what type of TurboDOS 86 system are you
running?  Single user or network?  What hardware?

Sorry for the delay.  My copy of the CCS documentation for cp/m 2.2
only reproduces the DRI documents.  It includes no ccbios.asm BIOS source 
except the skeleton that DRI provided to all their customers.  Sorry.

On the other side, re: disassemblers, I had two ideas:

 (1) I found a Z80 dissassembler on OAK's SIMTEL mirror:
     OAK.oakland.edu, /pub/simtel20/msdos (I think), as
     /pub/simtel20/msdos/disasm/dasmz80.arc (whew)
     I haven't ftp'd it nor tried it, but the name looks right.

 (2) Many BIOS were written with 8080 instructions, only.
     Do you _know_ you need z80 instructions decoded in your
     BIOS?  (Naturally, you may need a z80 source if you intend to 
     patch it with z80 opcodes.)

Message-ID: <43855@mentor.cc.purdue.edu>

Hello.  I know this is a ridiculus rush, but I'm left with little choice.
I have literally two to three weeks to learn everything I can about the 
CP/M software available for my computer's version of the OS, called in the
manual, "CP/M 3+", for the Commodore 128.  The processor used is the Z80,
without any math coprocessors or whatever else there is.  Several stores
have been unable to help me find the reference manual for the version I have,
and the I can't find any books in the campus library for my version.  I
don't even know what versions would be similar to the one I have or what 
versions came before and after it.  I have *very* little experience with 
it, so *absolutely anything* would be helpful and greatly appreciated.

The reason I am so desperately interested in the OS all of the sudden is it
seems to be the only chance I have of finding a *good* C compiler for my
computer.  Is there a C compiler for CP/M 3+ that conforms to the ANSI standard
or at least conforms completely to the K&R standard?  Is any of it available
from ftp?  Does anyone know of a source for the manual?

Knowing so little about the subject, if my post doesn't belong in the cpm
group, or I haven't given enough info or anything else is wrong, please tell
me...

Thanx,
Trever,

Trever, the Commodore 128 runs CP/M Plus (aka CP/M 3.0).  If you 
have a manual for your 128, it includes a coupon that when sent 
in to DRI (Digital Research Inc.) along with a check for $19.95, 
will get you manual for CP/M Plus.  If you do not have the 
manual, I can send you a copy of the coupon which works equally 
well.  Send SASE and mention what it is for.
    
In regards to a full K & R C compiler:
    
C FEVER catch it!
    
I have copies of a booklet with the above title.  It explains 
all the features of the MIX C compiler and the MIX Editor.  If 
you would like to know more about these bargain priced products, 
send a stamped, self-addressed envelope to me at the address 
below.  Outside of the US, send $1.00 (refundable with your 
order) along with your name and address.  C FEVER, catch it for 
CP/M or DOS, without going broke.
     
To the best of my knowledge there is no ANSI compatible C 
compiler for CP/M.

Message-ID: <wspas59.702723544@rw9.urc.tue.nl>

This week I downloaded some CPM software from wuarchive.wustl.edu.
Because it had been arc-ed I downloaded the unarcer too, although I
already have one on my MSX system (with cp/m+).
Although I set the binary mode in FTP something is essentially wrong
with the files. After I copied them to 3,5" disks on an AT, and converted
them to cp/m format, the unarcer refuses to unarc them (well, that IS
what an unarcer should do isn't it...) . It keeps telling me that
something is wrong with the archive file header and then it skips some
bytes.
At first I thought it was the unarcer I downloaded. In my opinion it had
a strange length (just about 5KB) while the one on my MSX system is
about 15KB I believe, and that's just a cp/m conversion..... Maybe it
should be mentioned that this one won't unarc my files either.

Can someone tell me what I'm doing wrong (without laughing me in the
face...) ?

 all help appreciated,

SPECIALS.CMP must be in alphabetical order.  THEWORD

Enter: DICTSORT SPECIALS.CMP to prep the list.  Your

THEWORD was available for MSDOS 1.0.  It runs in later releases

There was once a program called Uniform, which had both CP/M and DOS 
versions, which allowed conversion of the other.  I believe another program 
was called MediaMaster.  No one I've contacted has a copy (of the CP/M 
version), and no one else had responded when I asked.

Digital Research is no longer supporting CP/M.  A few years ago, I sent
them a letter asking for information, the reply came from a totally different
company, was a form letter, and it did not answer my question.

If you have FTP capability, you can get 22DISK from the Simtel-20 echoes,
under MSDOS/DSKUTL.  It's shareware.  The freely distributable version
supports many disk formats, and the registered version adds support for
even more.

I have Oasis documentation from Phase One.  If you have any trouble
locating same, I can probably get copies to you.  Phase One told me, when
I got my copies, that I got one of the last three available, and that
there would be no future printings of the doc.s.  If this turns out to be
the case, I would be happy to help.  I have the doc.s for the Oasis System
Reference Manual, the Executive (Exec) Processing lang., and Oasis Basic;
which IMHO is the best Basic around.  I may be able to locate more if
needed.  
 
I am running Oasis on an IBC MultiStar with 55meg HD and TeleVideo
monitor.  It will accomodate up to 6 terminals and one printer as it
stands now.  Pretty neat machine.

I think you'll be better of with the HiTech C if you want ANSI compatibility.
It's ANSI comp. and does floats and all. I've ported 'less' to my CPM machine.

Subject: CP/M on an Apple II
Message-ID: <1992Mar23.151028.13651@meaddata.com>

I run CP/M on an Apple //e with a Microsoft Premium Softcard //e installed.
This card is a 6 MHz Z80 coprocessor, 64K memory expansion, and 80-column
combination card that fits the AUX slot of the Apple //e.  However, I'm in
the process of migrating to an Apple IIgs, which doesn't have an AUX slot.
I'd like to know if there is a high-speed Z80 card that will work in one of
the standard slots of the IIgs, preferably without disabling the built-in
function of the slot or slowing down the system speed.  I've heard of an
"AppliCard" (or something like that), but don't know anything about it or
where I can get one.  I'd consider buying such a card from someone, or
trading the Softcard for it and a normal 64K/80-column card for the //e.
Thanks!

In addition to Uniform there is a product called DosDisk sold by
Sage Microsystems East, 1435 Centre Street, Newton Centre, MA
02159-2469. It claims to allow DOS disks to be read directly in a
CP/M machine. Price varies from $30 to $45 depending on version.

(I have no connexion with the firm except as a customer for another
product with which this one was advertised).

There are various PD programs for the  purpose on simtel20. The
only one I could make work was PCSWP05. It's rather slow, but it
does the job. You have to be able to configure your system to
recognize the physical format of the DOS disk.

Edward, actually I misspoke.  The coupons are addressed to and 
should mailed to Commodore and not to DRI.  The manual that will 
be sent is a copy of the DRI CP/M Plus User's Guide, Programmer's 
Guide, and System Guide all bound into one volume.  It says that 
it is reprinted by Commodore with the permission of DRI.  Take 
care.

I think the C128 CP/M manual and source code disks came from Commodore,
not from DRI.  In any case, as of one year ago, they were still available,
as was the 1581 (3.5 inch) version of C128 CP/M.

There are licensed vendors selling CP/M. Alexander and Lord in the Bay 
area comes to mind, though you'd better be sitting down when you see the 
price. Another source (and MUCH more reasonable!): Lambda Software Publishing
(David McGlone). Let me know if you need the address.

Subject: DOS <> CP/M under CP/M

On Simtel-20 (sorry, no time to check where....) I found quite some time
ago a program TRANSFER that does it, fast and neat.
More often (because I download in office with a fast link) I would use
22DSK under DOS for the conversion, but from time to time I make such copies
at home with my dear LOBO-80, one 360k drive (40 tracks double sided) which
I use as the "MSDOS" drive for TRANSFER, and one 720k (80 tracks double sided)
holding CP/M.
To correctly use TRANSFER, it must of course be on a/the CP/M drive  (B disk
on my system). I never had any problem with this program, ecept that it halts
the computer, and you reboot, if you type in wrong diskettes assignments when
prompted. One of the most frequent typos is to say A: instead of A for a drive.
Again sorry (author, excuse me...) but I'm short of time to retrieve the
SIMTEL location of this program.
                                          Jacques

Try mirrors/cpm/dskutl/swp-ms10.ark from wuarchive.wustl.edu.  It contains
the Turbo Pascal sources of a program to read and write ms-dos disks on 
a CP/M host. You must adapt a few routines to your CP/M host. It uses a
SWEEP-like user interface, supports MS-DOS directories, knows about text
and binary files and contains a good error handling.

There is a program called, I believe, rdms.com.  I have a copy of it and it 
does the job.  The author has posted to this group within the last few months,
if I'm not mistaken.  Perhaps he will catch this and respond....

Nobody makes anything for S100 anymore, it is just a question of what kind
of controller card you can scrounge up, and if you can reverse engineer it
or find documentation.

Well, if you are really into homebrew, here are two pretty reasonable ways
to go:  The first is SCSI (SASI), this is really a pretty simple parallel
interface with a well documentated protocol.  I hacked together a simple
interface that worked, based on a 8255 PIO chip, but if I had it to do
again, I would probably just use ttl latches and buffers.  Simple hardware
means driving all the scsi states with software, no big deal.  You can
push more of the work into hardware if you want, add DMA, make it as complex
as you want to.

Another option is the very popular IDE interface being used in PC's.
A couple reasons this is not as attractive as SCSI:  It has a 16-bit data
bus (so if you want this in a Z80 system, forget it).  Also the price of
SCSI drives is about the same as IDE drives these days, so why mess with
the IDE jobs -- you also have to pry documentation out of the vendors
(which is not all that hard actually), and once again write a driver/bios
to support it.

Forget homebrewing an MFM interface unless you are a real whiz at designing
phase locked loops and such to build the data separator, go with the
"smart" drives like the SCSI.

Just my opinions after all.

It is not clear to me just what it is that you want to do on the PC.  Are you
talking about getting a TRSDOS emulator up?  Or is it to run a TRS-80 CP/M
program?

If the latter, the obvious choice is Sydex' 22DISK, which permits running CP/M
2.2 programs on a PC.  If the former, I cannot help you.

Hi all,

I am also interested in reading, writing and maybe even formatting 360K
PC disks in my CPM drive. But as far as I learned, all programs that
are mentioned in this list, assume that the physical sector length is
512 bytes long. Debugging my BIOS I found that my FDC is programmed to
use 256 byte sectors and to pack 8 sectors on side 1 and 8 sectors on
side 2 (total: 16 sectors per track). Since the FDC is a uPD765,
which I think was used in old PC-XT's too, there should be no problems
doing the required tasks, if somebody can tell me how to progam the
appropriate registers; i.e. I need information for such things like
GAP length, fill byte, etc. Can anybody out there provide me this
informations? Has anybody written a program to format such a drive?
Is my opinion correct, that the physical data like HEAD UP TIME, STEP
RATE, HEAD LOAD TIME, neeed not to be changed?

                                                    Thanks in advance

Subject: File transfers for Epson PX-8
Message-ID: <tco62INNqtf@cs.utexas.edu>

A friend of mine just got an Epson PX-8 and we need some way to transfer
files to and from it.  The terminal program he has for it only does ASCII
transfers and we have lots of programs (including other term programs)
that we'd like to be able to use with it.  If anyone has any kind of file
transfer utility, or term program that they could send him on PX-8 tape
or disk we would be eternally grateful.  Please direct your responses
directly to him at:

aggedor@ccwf.cc.utexas.edu

Thanks.

Two remarks with respect to TRANSFER:
1- Guenter Radestock (Radest@IRA.UKA.DE) has recently improved TRANSFER.
   Some major bugs are removed from TRANSFER (you could not copy a file
   of exactly 64 KB).
2- SWP-MS10.ARK (also available on Simtel-20) is a complete rewrite of
   TRANSFER, with added functionality.

Subject: SUMMARY: Z80 disassemblers
Message-ID: <55630@hydra.gatech.EDU>

Many thanks to those who responded to my question about Z80 disassemblers.
Wow, I didn't know there was still so much CP/M and Z80 stuff around.  I am
impressed by all the goodies that are available, many of them home grown.
Anyway, on to the summary.

Most people mentioned some of the CP/M based disassemblers available on
SIMTEL.  Evidently there is even a CP/M emulator which will run these on
a non-CP/M box.  Neat!  There are also some cross-disassemblers available
from uunet and from the authors directly.  Finally, there is at least one
commercial product from Pseudo Corp in Newport News, VA.  A list of all the
different disassemblers and related stuff follows.

Z80 Disassemblers
  ZDASM         from SIMTEL20
  DAZZLESTAR    from SIMTEL20 
  Z80-DIS22     from SIMTEL20 
  Z8E           from SIMTEL20 
  DIS80         from astro.as.arizioni.edu
  ZMAC          from uunet
  FRANKENSTEIN  from wuarchive.wustl.edu

CP/M Emulator
  Z80MU52b      from SIMTEL20

Many thanks to those who responded.

Subject: TRS-80 Emulators
Message-ID: <1580.9204241206@clus1.ulcc.ac.uk>

There is a TRS-80 Model III emulator called PC-THree available from
Hypersoft, PO Box 51155, Raleigh, NC 27609. This emulates the entire
machine, and provides a disk transfer program which creates 'filedisks'
on your MS-DOS hard disk from which TRS-80 operating systems and 
application software can be run. It works quite well, although the
graphics emulation leaves a lot to be desired. It will drive the PC's
serial port and a printer attached to the PC. There is no emulation
of the cassette port (and therefore no sound emulation). You really need
an AT or above to run it efficiently - otherwise the keyboard driver tends
to lose characters.

Since the model III emulates the Model I to a large extent, you can run
much Model I software on a MS_DOS PC under Pc-Three.

Hypersoft also produce PC-FOUR, which emulates the Model 4 in native mode
only. I'm not sure if it also emulates the LS-DOS operating system or
if you have to copy that to a 'filedisk' as with Pc-Three. Pc-four
will not emulate a Model 4 running CP/M.

I should be glad to know if any of the rumours of public-domain
emulators can be substantiated.

Subject: WANTED: Z80 disassembler
Message-ID: <55273@hydra.gatech.EDU>

Sorry if this is a FAQ and sorry if these news groups aren't the most 
appropriate place for this question but it was the closest fit I could 
find!

I need to find a disassembler for some Z80 code sitting in a system with
no documentation.  I have looked in a few magazines like Circuit Cellar, 
etc.  without much luck.  Can anyone recommend a source for either a 
software-only disassembler or an in-circuit-emulator which includes
disassembly capability.  I need to end up with a source listing that I can
then document (for future generations, presumably).  Money is no (well, it
actually always is but..) object.

Thanx in advance and sorry again for the sort of poor fit between my 
question and the major "theme" of the news group.  But I'm desperate!
