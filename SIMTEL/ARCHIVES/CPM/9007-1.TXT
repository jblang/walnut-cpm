Subject: cp/m to ibm

Since several people seem to be interested, I will review the ways I know of
to transfer files between cp/m disks and ibm disks.

1.  UNIFORM and MEDIA MASTER are commercial programs which run on ibm's and
read or write most cp/m formats.

2.  A public domain program called RDMS will read ibm disks on a cp/m machine.
 I know there is a C128 version available on Simtel, GEnie, etc.

3.  A good way to transfer stuff on a C128 is to use ibm cp/m86 disk format.
That is one of the formats which the 128 understands by default (both the
single sided and double sided forms are supported).  A lot of ibm compatibles
have a utility which will read and write cpm86 disks.  I know the Zenith at's
which the government buys has such a utility.

Hope that is helpful.  I have used method 3 extensively, and find it to be the
easiest.

Also on the C128, Big Blue Reader is a program (commercial) which runs in 128
mode and will convert files from ibm, cp/m, and commodore 5.25 and 3.5 disks.
It has the ability to read and write to any of those forms (although the only
cp/m formats supported are the native commodore (GCR) formats).

 A friend of mine who works for CA state gov't needs an Amstrad PCW 9512.
 Frankly I'm not at all sure exactly was this beast is, the way he
 described its features the 9512 sounds like a dedicated word processor
 machine. However, he called it a CPM computer. Any help would be most
 appreciated.

I know now that the Amstrad is an English computer and is still available.
If I could get a line on a used one that would be great.

Thanks for any help you can give.

I believe the Z88 uses an Intel 8088 cpu, rather than the Zilog Z80.
The ZX-80 was a Z80 machine, though.

Subject: Various answers to various questions...
Message-ID: <5804@balu.UUCP>

This is about several themes of the last ~50 messages.

1. WordStar with HP-LJ
I think it's not that hard installing the HPLJ to WordStar 3.3. However, you
can use only about 5% of the printer's features. Ever thought of WS 4.0?
With that, HPLJ is fully supported (including proportional spacing, various
fonts and so on), and many new functions are added. WS 4.0 for CP/M behaves
exactly like WS 4.0 for MSDOS, if you know. I'm using WS 4.0 myself, and I
wouldn't miss it anymore.

2. CP/M to DOS conversion
Seems to me that there was someone who wanted to *run* DOS programs (or even
DOS O.S.) under CP/M. That is *impossible* anyway 'cause of different object
codes. The only thing you can do is *transfer* any kind of data (usually
source code) between the two. For that, there are some transfer programs
available. 22DISK was mentioned; I prefer using my own program (published
in c't mag in 1987). These programs just copy files from CP/M to a DOS disk
with respect to the different disk format and organization.

3. CP/M 3.0 Tools and Utilities
Every program written for CP/M 2.2 will also run with CP/M 3.0, as long as it
doesn't use direct BIOS calls (which are handled very different). For those
applications where this is impossible (i.e. Disk Utilities), there are CP/M 3
versions (or universal versions) available everywhere (or no need for!).
Concerning data file transfer between CP/M and MSDOS versions of the same
program, there are slight differences. For example, with WS-CP/M special
characters are stored directly, while with DOS-WS they are embedded in 1Bh
and 1Ch (or 9B/1C when soft-formatted). So you need an additional format
translator for transferring WS documents between CP/M and DOS. Don't know if
there are this kind of differences in file format of the other programs that
were mentioned.

4. Printing with PIP
Susie Keim was writing that the machine messages 'not enough memory' when
trying to copy a file to the printer with PIP. I never knew that PIP contained
such a message, so I guess the system was outputting it. That could be the
result of a damaged (or just too large) PIP.COM file. It should be about 8k.
Please check out *who* is messaging there (system or PIP), which should be
distinguishable by 'before/during/after' loading PIP.

5. WordStar to ASCII
There is a point in the 'printing menu' at which you can choose 'print to
disk'. That's exactly what you are looking for. This relates to WS 3.x.
When using WS 4.0, there's a special printer driver named 'ASCII' which does
the same.

6. WordStar Menu delays
There are three delay times in the patch area of WS (all versions). One of
them is that for the menues to remain onscreen. At least you could minimize
this value, which would result in the signons beeing displayed one after
another. BTW ever thought of WS 3.0, 3.1 or 4.0 ? Version 3.3 is the only one
with that screen-filling signon...

Gary, don't spread such vile rumours :-) James Slayden was correct, the Z88
has a Z80. (I have one right here in my backpack...) Clocked at around
3.5Mhz, as I recall. OZ is actually an "operating system", rather than a
control program, though I have a few ideas on how to write a bdos/bios
emulator for it to convert those calls to the equivalent OZ functions. (If
you'd be interested in such a thing, let me know.)

OZ is multitasking, handles memory banking and management, has a hierarchical
file system, named device drivers, as well as floating point and long integer
functions. There is a complete reference manual (several hundred pages.) I've
never tried UZI, but it could probably be made to work in a Z88 with lots of
memory (they have 1Meg cards now, and you can use two or maybe three of them
at once [and still run on 4 AA batteries :-)])

This is what I've been using for several years. Easiest to do and I have
a a disk I use just for this purpose. Write to it on the PC, put it in
the Molecular, PIP the files off of it and DEL *.* then back to the PC
for the next load. Since it's very configurable, you don't have to worry
about how many drives you have, hard OR floppy.

I've looked around for something like this that will work on the Mole
with no success.

Subject: MS-DOS Emulator V2 coming soon - Info on DPHs and DPBs needed
Message-ID: <2289@iddth.UUCP>

MS-DOS Emulator V2

MS-DOS Emulator's V1.03 (demo/test) is to be followed by the
full-featured V2 soon (I hope at the end of July - the work has been
seriously delayed due to moving into a new house and the hard work
related to that). A demo/test version will be posted on the net as soon
as it will work. I intend to distribute the V2 as shareware, since it
required some 6 months of work (mainly on evenings and during weekends -
the temporary abandon of the work after V1.03 is not included).

For making the emulator as much machine- and CP/M version-independent as
possible, I would be very glad to get information on the format of Disk
Parameters Blocks (DPBs) and Disk Parameters Headers (DPHs) used on
different systems. My machine is a Commodore 128 with CP/M Plus. The
only requirements to a system for running the MS-DOS Emulator are (1) to be
able to read MFM diskettes with 40 tracks and 512-byte sectors and (2)
to do no translation of the sector and track numbers. The second
condition is not observed by some CP/M Plus systems (Commodore 128 is
among them) and this is the reason of my request for information on DPBs
and DPHs. Any BIOS sources (if not copyrighted) are also wellcomed.

The MS-DOS Emulator V1.03 is a demo/test version running only on
Commodore 128. The emulator allows the user to handle files on MS-DOS
diskettes directly with CP/M's commands and programs. It makes,
actually, the CP/M to recognize the MS-DOS format. The MS-DOS formats
supported depends only on the possibilities of a certain system to
read/write the MS-DOS diskettes.

        Use the print (P) option from the main menu.  One of the
        choices is "Print to file?".  Answer yes to this option and
        Wordstar will send a formatted version of the text to the
        indicated file.  Keep in mind that any printer codes
        associated with text enhancements (bold, underline, etc.)
        will be included in the text written to the disk file.

I have used this method and I stumbled on a little problem: many
characters have bit 7 set to 1. It causes some troubles when converting
files to other formats or when printing them out on some types of
printers. I currently copy files to MS-DOS and Commodore 128 formats.
The solution: copy the file resulting from WordStar's "P" command with
the PIP utility, using the "z" option - it zeroes bit 7. The command
line should look like:

	PIP newfile=oldfile[Z]

PIP can be run from WordStar by using the "R" command.

Happy hacking,

The easiest way to speed the start up of CP/M WS 3.3 is to use DDT to put
a NOP just after the start of the screen data, which is near the front of
the ws.com file (I think the file's right - I know its near the front). I
found the right place pretty quickly, but it was a few years ago.

I also wrote an overlay to patch WS 3.3 with MLOAD, once and for all. If 
anyone wants a copy, email me and I'll try to dig it out.  Basically (well,
assembler, actually...) a list of all the patch points I could dig out of
miscellaneous sources.

Good luck - Will

A few years ago I was using an Osborne I and then graduated to an
Osborne Executive (it came w/ UCSD Pascal).  I (reluctantly) moved all
my computing to MS-Dos about 4 years back.  
Well, this isn't alt.folklore.computers, so on to my question:  

I recently needed to access some of my data from my Osborne I days, and 
found (actually remembered) that Media Master and Uniform will not read
single density disks.  I presume that this is a hardware limitation of 
the *BM drive.  Can anyone give me any info on how to read my ancient

Bzzzzzzztt, Sorry, no stove, no cigar.  The Z88 uses a Z80.
Sir Clive wanted the QL to have a Z80, but his engineers
wanted the sporty 68008.  With the Z88, he went back to the
reliable Z80.
The original poster was right in that respect.  But the OS is not
called OZ, it is called PipeDream.

   Bzzzzzzztt, Sorry, no stove, no cigar.  The Z88 uses a Z80.
   Sir Clive wanted the QL to have a Z80, but his engineers
   wanted the sporty 68008.  With the Z88, he went back to the
   reliable Z80.
   The original poster was right in that respect.  But the OS is not

According to documentation which came with my TRS-80 emulator for
the PC, the problem is with the disk controller, not with the
drives. You might be able to find someone with a non-standard
controller in his PC which could read the Osborne disks.
 
The Sydex 22disk program states of the Osborne 1 single-density
format:
 
This format requires a controller capable of operating in single-density
(FM) mode.  If you are using a standard PC-style controller, you will most
likely NOT be able to handle this format.  The MicroSolutions CompatiCard
will handle this format, however, and may be used in addition to your
normal controller.
 
22Disk (at least the registered version) handles the following
Osborne formats:
 
 OSB1   Osborne 1 - SSSD 48 tpi 5.25"
 OSB2   Osborne 1 - SSDD 48 tpi 5.25"
 OSB3   Osborne Executive - SSDD 48 tpi 5.25"
 OSB4   Osborne G2 System - DSDD 48 tpi 5.25"
 OSB5   Osborne G2 System - DSDD 96 tpi 5.25"
 OSB6   Osborne 1 + Osmosis - DSDD 96 tpi 5.25"
 OSB7   Osborne Nuevo - DSDD 48 tpi 5.25"
 OSB8   Osborne Vixen - DSDD 48 tpi 5.25"
 OSB9   Osborne Executive w/Z3 - DSDD 96 tpi 5.25"

Subject: Working with MS-DOS Disks Under CP/M

   I have watched the discussion about moving information between CP/M
and MS-DOS diskettes hoping that someone would provide full
information.  When I saw the recent message from "Long Haired Nicky" I
decided I better add my two cents.

   I do not understand why "Nicky" is working on the project he is,
since a superb product already exists.  It is DosDisk from Bridger
Mitchell's Plu*Perfect Systems.  DosDisk runs on a number of machines,
including C128s, Kaypros, and Morrows.  It allows the CP/M machine to
work directly with MS-DOS diskettes using all standard programs.
DosDisk even supports DOS subdirectories and time/date stamps.  The
only useful thing that it cannot do is format diskettes in MS-DOS
format.  I have never really thought about it, but it is probably
limited to the standard 360K DSDD format.

   Preconfigured versions of DosDisk for a list of about 10 machines
cost only $30.  For SB180 computers with XBIOS, there is a special
version of DosDisk that runs as a BSX and takes up NO TPA!  There is a
kit version for $45 for those who can write their own overlay drivers.
Anyone who wants further information is welcome to contact me.

Disclaimer: My wife's company sells the whole line of Plu*Perfect
Systems software, including DosDisk, and I played a role as an alpha
and beta tester in the design of DosDisk (I'm the one who asked for
subdirectory support).  Since I work on a Compaq 386 at work and an
SB180 at home, I use DosDisk all the time.  It is the only product
that allows me to keep the time/date stamps current across both
machines.

Message-ID: <1990Jul6.224018.5038@actrix.co.nz>

I own an Amstrad CPC6128 which runs CP/M Plus (61K TPA, 180K disks). I
can read most other 5.25" CP/M disk formats to import data/programs.

I am looking for a C compiler for my machine.  Requirements: Moderately
fast, Moderately good, Fairly cheap, minimum of K&R standard.
 
Does anyone have any comments, recommendations, or suggestions.  Any
contact addresses, or prices would be appreciated.

I have heard that the Mix C compiler (CP/M version) is quite good, but I
don't have a contact address, or a current price.  Does anyone else?

Please post to the net, or mail suggestions to the address below (the
header may be wrong).

Thanks in advance, Ewen McNeill.

Hello CPMers.

Encouraged by the warm and very efficient response when I recently asked
about VT100 emulation, I dare ask something else now.

I have seen in the archive a compiler <cpm.pascal-p>. Because the files are
large, and before I load networks with a request, can any of you tell if this
could be the PolyPascal compiler? Does it resemble early versions of
CP/M-80 TurboPascal, of the days it still was almost true Pascal?
I still use JRT-Pascal, is that pascal-p better?

You'll just have to find a machine that can do it. I presume that you don't
have the Osborne anymore, so you'll have to find someone else that can.

I was able to read one with my Kaypro 10 using Uniform.

Musta been a REAL old version of Uniform. I thought it was capable of
single density so I just fired up version 1.08 and I'm looking at it on
my PC screen right now. Not only does it support several single density
formats, it even specifically lists TWO Osborne I formats, both double
AND single desity. So, all you need is a newer version of Uniform and
you've got it licked. :-)  As to Media Master, I can't help you there.
Never tried it.

Dear Jacques, I may not be real sure but Kermit works for me.  However,
I'm using a VT180 and that may be translating the ansi in firmware instead
of via Kermit.  Good Luck!

According to a file included with the CP/M emulator, it does appear to be in
the public domain, placed there by none other than Atari Corp. (who also 
appears to be the one who commissioned the port to the ST.) I got it off of
Terminator, though I'll be happy to mail it to you if you wish. Please respond
by email and I'll do it (its over 200K uuencoded/arc'ed so I don't want to be
one of ten doing it :-) )

I'm glad you asked about it though, since I use it occasionally, and find that
a few pieces of functionality and information are missing and was thinking of
bringing up the topic myself. First of all, I can't find any information about
hard-disk support under CP/M, though the TOS filesystem commands can access the
hard disk. Also, there's not enough info to make changes to CP/M itself like
upgrading to ZCPR. (For those of you not familiar with it, the Atari ST CP/M 
emulator emulates a "documented" Z80, i.e. doesn't implement the undocumented
Z80 opcodes.) If anyone can help, please post or email.

From: Sprague.WBST311@Xerox.COM
Subject: Help needed with TeleVideo TS-804
Message-ID: <900709-114903-1797@Xerox>

An old college buddy of mine picked up a TeleVideo TS-804, complete with a
tape backup unit (TS-806C), and an extra terminal.  He knew nothing about
it other than he thought it was CP/M and asked me to take a look at it when
I stopped by his place on my vacation over the forth.

It booted up fine for me (his wife thought she had screwed the hard disk
up), and I found out that it was running MP/M II.  I had no problem looking
into different things and showing he and his wife how to use it.  We
started cleaning out all the garbage left over from the previous owners
WordStar letters and memos (I was rather surprised to find that this
company information had not been deleted).  While my buddy had gotten most
of the documentation that went with this system, (except for the MP/M
Manuals and the TS-804 Technical Reference Manual) the ONLY floppy disk he
had gotten was the WordStar Master disk.  As I have never messed with MP/M
before some things were not obvious.

Anyway, the following morning, the system would not boot up.  It came out
of Diagnostics and said:

WDC NOT READY ERROR

I assume WDC means Winchester Drive Controller, but this error message does
not give me enough information to tell if it is a problem with the Hard
Drive, or the Hard Drive Controller.  Does anybody know?  We opened the
case, and did the obvious things ... look for anything out of place, check
all the connectors, and so on, but still it would not boot.  Since we had
no bootable floppies ......

After we had given up, his wife flicked the power switch off an on one more
time (Yes, I know about Shift/ Break Break), and suddenly everything came
up.  We grabbed some floppies and started formatting them.  I then used
WRITESYS on several of them, to create bootable disks.  I made up a
WordStar disk, so that they could use the computer even if the hard drive
would not work. For now anyway, word processing is the main thing they want
to do with it.

I continued cleaning up the hard drive, and backing some of the software up
on floppies.  Later on into the evening, the thing started acting funny ...
telling me that there were no files on floppies that I KNEW had files on
them.  I rebooted it, and got some sort of disk error.  Since a bunch of
other old college buddies had showed up, we did not do anything else.

The next day, again it would not boot up ... same problem.  I was pretty
sure by that time that I knew why he had gotten it so cheap ... and why
none of the companies files had been deleted.  :-)

I tried booting from some of the floppies, and discovered that MPM.SYS was
also needed for the bloody thing to boot.  Grumble, my inexperience with
MP/M got me.  All I had to do was get the thing to boot once, and I could
take care of that problem ... of course, it wouldn't boot until his wife
flipped the power switch one more time ... when I had the car all packed
and ready to leave for home.

This time, it wouldn't come up though.  This time it said:

MPMLDR error: Dsk rd err

I assume this means that it had read problems while trying to start/run the
MP/M loader?  That's all it would do from that point on.  So, here we were
with a hard drive that wouldn't boot, containing the one file needed to
make the floppies boot.  Catch-22.

So ..... could anyone tell me any more about the WDC error?  Would anyone
have an MP/M system disk, or at least an MPM.SYS file for the TeleVideo
TS-804?  If we can boot from a floppy, I am pretty sure we can get at the
files on the hard drive .... or at least they can still use WordStar from a
floppy.

Out of curiosity, is it still possible to get MP/M?

Message-ID: <1990Jul9.150653.14988@cbnewsm.att.com>

A friend is trying to make use of an old CP/M XEROX
word processing system.  I can't seem to find the model
number at the moment, but it was an alphanumeric; the
system doesn't seem to have a model name. It has 2 
8" floppy drives. The owner has a good supply of disks,
and has a disk that seems to be a boot disk, but 
nothing happens when it tries to boot off this. BTW,
when powered on, the system comes up with 3 choices:
typewriter, wordprocessor, or host terminal (or similar
descriptions). Maybe this will help identify the system.

To get to my question, does anyone know what this beast
is, and can software be acquired to make it useful?
It seems to be working OK other than the fact that it
won't boot off this floppy - the light comes on on the
floppy drive...

Thanks!

Subject: QX-10 with ZCPR3 and NovaDos
Message-ID: <9007091535.AD00042@adam.DG.COM>

CEO summary:
Over the weekend, I finally got around to installing NovaDos and I am 
currently working on installing ZCPR3 on the QX-10.  In installing 
NovaDos, I discovered after some debuging that the BIOS was patching 
the BDOS was causing things to be screwed up when the BDOS was 
replaced with a different version, but I got it to work.  I tried 
getting Z80DOS to work, but it keeps coldbooting.  Installing ZCPR3 
is difficult, but with the BDOS replacement, I think I can work out a 
way where I just add a BIOS extension overwriting the BDOS and using 
the original BIOS for services (this is where the ZCPR3 buffers will 
be stored, along with the cold boot requirements) and BDOS and BIOS 
will be loaded below that.  My questions are:
(1) Has anyone else installed any of these things on a QX-10? (If 
someone is insterested in using them after I am through, I would be 
interested to here from them as well).
(2) In loading NovaDos, it mentions a library NVDSUTL.LBR, and Z80DOS 
mentions library 2 of 3 as being Z8D24SUP.LBR.  Does anyone have 
these two libraries?  They are not on simtel20 where I got everything 
else.
(3) Any suggestions about installing ZCPR3 to use bank switching or 
in a fixed BIOS size environment?  Thanks.

Hiya all,
  I've just gotten ahold of a XEROX 16/8 with a single 8" flopy drive
  and all that.  Anyway, the boot disk is NO GOOD.  I called XEROX, who
  referred me to a users group, who told me that if I couldn't find
  someone to make me a copy of the system, I've got a very big doorstop!

  Needless to say, that's what I'm looking for.  A copy of the CP/M disks
  for this machine.  All those responding will be entered into
  a raffle for my firstborn child.

  Thanks.

Hello netlanders,

	This is my first time posting to this group, so forgive me if I
cover any old ground.

	I have an Amstrad 6128, running CPM 2.2+, which I play around with at 
home, it has the 3" disk drive. which is a rather expensive little toy, 
as the diskettes cost aprox $10 each...  What I would like to do is add on a 
5 1/4" drive (I can pick up an old ibm one quite easily.)  are there any 
suggestions, advise or experience that anyone could give me.


	My second question involves the presence of ftp sites for PD Amstrad
stuff around ???

Would anyone be willing to share the agonies, ecstasies, and other
practical advice as to BEGINNING to get the hardware/software which I
will need so I can access an IBM system from my home (Osborne 1--SSSD)
computer.  I am not an assembly language programmer--much more the user
of applications programs.  My main intended use is tracking netmail (our
library catalog is also online through the mainframe.  Is it asking too
much to even consider using the Osborne as a terminal for other
mainframe applications (like SAS, for example)?  Any advice would be
appreciated.  If the whole question is too fundamental, I would be
willing to take answers directly and summarize for the net.

I assume that the Simtel server will have numerous Osborne public domain
programs/utilities, and am anxious to search that out, but will save my
questions on THAT topic for another posting.

Thank you much--Andy Stewart, C3038b at umrvmb.umr.edu

Message-ID: <XX000118c2@pallio.UUCP>

I recently got an old computer with a pair of full height 5.25" drives in
it. One of them is out of alignment because disks formatted in this drive
can't be read by the other (or any other 5.25" drive in the house), and
disks formatted by a good drive (of which I have several), can't be read
by the bad drive. For those that are interested, the drives are made by
Tandon, and use a split band actuator to move the heads.

If you read this in comp.peripherals, please E-mail to the address below,
since I don't get a feed of that group here on pallio.

Are you SURE about those choices?  THe Xerox 820-II comes up

Subject: QX-10 and Z-system
Message-ID: <0093991DD3485260.00000111@dcs.simpact.com>

I run ZCPR 3.3 on an SB-180, and wanted to run it also on my QX-10.  I decided
the best way to play it was to move the BDOS down, and put the ZCPR buffers
between the BDOS and BIOS.  However, I couldn't find out how (where) the QX10
kept the location of the BDOS for use in eg. the  warm-boot code; in the end,
other tasks became more relevant.  Bank 0 is full of goodies, by the way - I
remapped the keyboard to handle an ASCII unit, and found a lot of fascinating
graphics primitives (?); if Epson had only documented their software, the
QX-10 would have swept all before it.  I look at a 600x400 screen, totally
unusable to me unless I program the graphics controller directly, and  feel
very discouraged.

Jay Sage came across one of my pleas for help on a BBS, and wrote me a note
to say that a lot of people in his area were running the Z-system on QX-10s
with no real problems.  I don't know which version they were running; it may
be later than 3.3.  I recently got a price for the current ZCPR/ZRDOS to run
on a QX-10 from Jay Sage's company (~$140 total) and decided it just wasn't
cost effective.  If you ran the new ZCPR with NOVADOS (is that possible?)
it would only cost you ~$75; pricey, but might be worth it.

Anway, good luck - Will

Subject: QX-10 and Z-system

   This is in response to Will Rose's recent message.

>> I decided the best way to play it was to move the BDOS down, and put the
>> ZCPR buffers between the BDOS and BIOS.

   Even if you could figure out how to do this, it does not result in the
best solution.  There are quite a few CP/M programs that calculate addresses
on the assumption that the BDOS is 0E00H below the BIOS entry point.  They
will fail after you have made your modification.  You would also have to
perform a code relocation on the BDOS, since it would now be running at a
different address, and you would have to change the BIOS warmboot so that it
would load the BDOS and CCP to the new addresses.

>> However, I couldn't find out how (where) the QX10 kept the location of

   Is it not kept on the system tracks of the diskette the way it is on
other CP/M computers?

   The ones I know about most recently are using NZCOM.  It is not a
question, in any case, of the ZCPR version.  They all run more or less the
same way.  Later versions just have improved features.  ZCPR33 is a MAJOR
improvement over ZCPR3; ZCPR34, the latest version, has some nice additional
features but nothing anyone really has to have.

   There was apparently a major misunderstanding here.  The cost of NZCOM is
$70, and that provides a COMPLETE, automatically installing, and fully
reconfigurable (statically and dynamically) Z-System, INCLUDING the ZRDOS
disk operating system replacement code.  It is very easy, if not trivial, to
substitute NOVADOS or Z80DOS.  In fact, you can change DOSs at will, even in
the middle of a command line!  You can then experiment easily with different
versions of the DOS without having even to reboot the computer.

   The finest replacement DOS, in my opinion, is ZDOS (the ZSDOS/ZDDOS pair
of datestamping DOSs).  The full price of that package is $75; it is reduced
to $60 for owners of NZCOM (or ZRDOS in any form obtained legitimately).
There is no need to purchase ZDOS with NZCOM.

   If $70 stretches the budget too much and/or one would rather invest
significant amounts of time, then a manual installation of ZCPR33 makes
sense.  This is not easy if you do not have source code for the BIOS or a
version of MOVCPM that will move the whole system down in memory.

   Otherwise, there are many reasons, as I set forth in one of my TCJ
columns, to prefer NZCOM -- for technical and performance reasons, not just
for the ease of installation.  The Ampro on which my Z-Node BBS is running
still has a manually installed Z-System, but that is only because I don't
have time to fix things that are not broken.  If I were doing it over, I
would certainly use NZCOM instead, as I do on my Televideo 803H and Amstrad
PCW8512 (actually, Z3PLUS on the Amstrad).

Subject: Replay to Cory Hug

   Cory Hug made the following response to me regarding my questioning of
Nicky's effort to write a program to allow a CP/M computer to work with IBM-
format diskettes:

>> SAGE,
>>      perhaps he is working on this project to help those of us who can't

   If he is working on it either because he did not like DosDisk or because
he wanted to release it freely to the public for those people who cannot
afford $30 (the price for the version for his C128), that is fine.  More
likely -- and this turned out to be the case -- he was completely unaware of
DosDisk.

   There are enough *unavailable* tools to work on that it is a shame to be
duplicating those that already exist.  Since Nicky referred to releasing his
program as shareware, the cost savings over the very inexpensive DosDisk
would be very little, except of course to those who take and use shareware
without paying for it.  Also, of course, Nicky may have more time than
money, and he may prefer to write his own program.

   All this notwithstanding, there are many people reading this digest whom
I would like to be aware of DosDisk.  For them, $30 will immediately provide
their computers with this much needed functionality.

I'm the proud new owner of a couple of TeleVideo TS816/40 and a 
TS816H/40.  Unfortunately these beauties came without any 
documentation or tapes (the 816/40 has a built in tape backup).  
One of the computers has TurboDos installed.  The TS816H is just 
a 40 meg HD (with power supply) in the same size case as the 
TS816/40.
         
I would like to locate documentation on the 816/40 and 816H/40, 
as well as TurboDos.  While I'm at it, I'd also like to find out 
something about a "TeleVideo PM Interface" card that has a ROM

and it looks like it plugs into an IBM (or clone) slot.  Can 
anyone help with information on these cards, I have several of 
them.
      
Finally, does anyone have any of the cards which, when plugged

workstation off of one of the TS816/40's?  Thanks in advance for 
any help you can provide.  Take care.

Qterm by the esteemed David Goodenough will emulate VT100 fairly well, if
the real terminal it's talking to has (at least) screen clear, direct
cursor addressing, line delete and line insert.  Char insert and char delete
help.  Look for QTERM42G.LBR on Simtel20.  You'll also need EXL.LBR or
something else that can handle ?Y? files.  However, source is not available.

I believe this is reasonably simple, given the hardware and the cable (ie.
an IDC and edge connector.)  The Amstrad is very widely used in England -
try writing to Amstrad PCW Magazine, 116-120 Goswell Road, London, EC1 7RD
and asking them if they know of an available kit or instructions.  A few
months subscription to this mag might be worthwhile (I don't know what their
overseas rates are) since they advertise all sorts of goodies like ramdisks,
ports, clocks, and more software than you knew existed.

Standard disclaimers apply - I don't actually even own an Amstrad, I've just
worked on a couple for friends.  It was felt that as we came from the same
country, we would have an inherent understanding...

Good luck - Will

David - you might also want to check that the drive's rotational speed
is up to spec.  I had two 5 1/4" floppys that could format disks for themselves
but no other drives could read them.  I found that the rotational speed was
off by about 5 milliseconds.  It should be about 200ms between index pulses.
Once adjusted (via a potentiometer on the circuit board) the drives worked
fine.  I used some diagnostic software that came with my computer but an
o-scope or counter or mabe even seat-of-the-pants adjustment while trying to
read a good disk would work...

	I too have an old full-height Tandon floppy drive.  It has a
'stroboscope' pattern on this what-ever-it-is-in-English which spins on
the bottom of the drive.  Light it with a mains-operated light bulb
and you can easily adjust the speed accurately enough.

Subject: Wordstar backspace and delete
Message-ID: <00939B7957768680.00000111@dcs.simpact.com>

A couple of people asked me how to change around the BS and DEL keys in
WordStar 3.3.  Off the top of my head, I thought Wsinstall would do it, but
this option must have been added only in later versions.  Since I loathe a
destructive backspace, I've never tried to change from the standard, but
below is a way of patching ws.com if you need to; I've tested it, and at
least for me, it works.
 
Ws.com has a number of keystroke despatch tables, which each consist of a
number of four-byte sequences.  The first two bytes are the key(s) to be
matched, and the second two are some form of jump location - I've not 
bothered to find out what.
 
The despatch table needed here is the file-editing command table, whose
start is marked by the internal label 'VTAB'.  In my version of 3.3, this
is at address 489h.  The four relevant keystrokes are ^S, ^H, ^G, and DEL.
For those keyboards that cannot produce DEL, Wordstar has an equivalent,
^_; I've ignored this.
 
We want to leave ^S and ^G alone, and make ^H act like DEL, and DEL act
like ^G.  Using DDT, this is done by changing the following locations
in my (3.3) version of ws.com:
 
    location 4a3h from dah to 43h  - for ^H
    location 4a4h from 63h to 68h
    location 543h from 43h to 64h  - for DEL 
    location 544h remains as 68h
 
If you're using winstall, you can use offsets from VTAB.
 
Function or arrow keys are more difficult; there seem to be two approaches.
 
There is a label UCONI, which I found at 29dh, which marks the user console
input routine.  (The routine before it is for console status, UCNSTA, and the
one following is console output, UCONO.)  One way to install function keys
would be to add an input routine that recognises them and translates them
into a keycode sequence (such as ^S or ^D) that Wordstar can understand.
 
The other approach is via a label XTAB, which I found at 655h.  This marks
the end of the (official) file-editing command dispatch table that starts at
VTAB; there is room, (I think) for a further 9 four-byte entries.  If you add
the keybcodes for function and arrow keys, and vector them to addresses that
are already used by standard Wordstar commands, you should get the required
result.  I haven't tried this.
 
Good luck - Will

Thanks - just as well I didn't continue...  Where do you put the buffers,

because I couldn't see how to move the BIOS.

I should have said 'the current ZCPR/ZDOS  ... ($130 plus tax and postage
where applicable)'.  I use ZRDOS 1.7, and consider it a step back from CP/Ms
BDOS - I'm very tired of 'ZRDOS error no. ??' messages.  I  should have said
it auto-installed, too - sorry.

True - if you're upgrading, this is the one to have.  I very much want date-
stamping.  The Z-system would be especially useful, I imagine, on the Amstrad
(since this machine is also under discussion).  I never did like CP/M 3.0;
seems awkward to use somehow, tho' there's a lot of power in there.

Subject: Amstrad 3.5" Diskettes

   I have an overstock of these diskettes.  We had high hopes that Z3PLUS
would become very popular with the Amstrad crowd in Europe.  As a result,
I bought a second-hand Amstrad to develop a custom version of Z3PLUS and
to produce the diskettes.  I also bought a supply of those ridiculously
expensive diskettes.  A hundred of them cost about as much as the whole
computer, with its extra high-density disk drive and serial port!

   Well, it turns out that those Amstrad folks are about the least
sophisticated computer users in the world, even the ones who consider
themselves super-intelligent and belong to Mensa (there is a user group
in the US for Amstrad owners that is loosely affiliated with Mensa).
They basically just live in their Locoscript wordprocessor, and that is
it.  Consequently, I have far more of these diskettes than I can use,
and I would like to see them doing someone some good.  I am willing to
ship them to anyone in the US postpaid at $35 per box of 10.  This is
less than I paid dealer-wholesale in quantity and is less than the price
in England, where competition appears to keep the price a little less
outrageous.

   This offer is good while supplies last.  My kids make good use of
Locoscript on the Amstrad, and an order for Z-System software comes
along every so often, so I will keep a few extra disks on hand.  I should
be able to part with five or six boxes.

A friend of mine in England advised me that another magazine was preferable.
It is called something like "8000 PCW".  I got an airmail subscription.  The
cost is quite steep: nearly $100 for a one-year, 12-issue subscription.  It
does have extensive, interesting advertisements.  There is an awful lot of
software available in England for the PCW computers.  One thing, though.
There is virtually no interest in or knowledge of the CP/M side of the
machines.  I think I have seen only one CP/M article, and it talked about
DDT, which I would regard as thoroughly obsolete at this point.

If all you want is some advertisements, I would be willing to lend you one
of my copies of "8000".

For the ?Y? files I've used UNCRLZH.COM

Before QTERM will run on a specific machine, however, it needs to be patched.
Obtain a copy of QTPATCH.LBR, which contains patch source code for various
machines, plus ZSM.COM and ZPATCH.COM; programs that make this a relatively
painless procedure.

I've become quite fond of QTERM because of it's scripting capability,
and personally have versions running on Altos 580, Sony SMC-70, 
Televideo TS-816/40 and of course TS-803.

Finally, the Z80DOS docs talk about a file Z80D24SUP which is not

One wants to put the buffers above the BIOS.  If you have a complete version
of MOVCPM, this is easy.  Just create a "smaller" system.  If you presently
have, say, a "61K system" and want 4K for ZCPR buffers, then create a "57K
system".  You will still have to add a patch to the BIOS coldboot code to
initialize the buffers.  That is pretty easy to do.

>> Yes, [the DOS is kept on the system tracks of the diskette,] but there

I'm not sure I quite followed this comment.  Usually there are a couple of
boot loader sectors and then the operating system in one contiguous block.
The CCP occupies 16 records (2k), the DOS 28 records, and the BIOS whatever
it takes.  There are characteristic signatures that allow one to identify
each of the three components.

>> I use ZRDOS 1.7, and consider it a step back from CP/Ms BDOS - I'm very

I've never been a fan of ZRDOS, either, but the cryptic error messages were
not the worst thing.  After all, one can look them up, and the program
DOSERR would convert the number into a full-text message.  What I really
objected to was the way public directories were (mis)implemented.  ZDOS
handled that matter nicely (and managed to fit in full error messages
nevertheless -- nothing like good coding!).

ZRDOS does have some good features.  I am told that it does run noticeably
faster than BDOS.  Also, deficient as the public directory implementation
might be, it still makes possible some things that could not otherwise be
done.

In any case, as I mentioned in my earlier message, it is quite trivial to
replace the ZRDOS that comes with NZCOM with either NOVADOS or Z80DOS.  The
latter, I know, comes in the ZRL relocatable format so that it can be
installed without any effort at all.

One other comment about ZDOS.  At $60 (for NZCOM owners), it is not very
much more than DateStamper ($50).  So for only $10 more, you get a superior
form of datestamping (less memory used and more flexibility) and a superior
DOS.

Yes, but who would want to do that ? I bought an ST to get software, 
even though I had a technically superior (and 20 times more expensive, 
originally) CP/M-68k machine.. . The only reasonable thing I can think of,
for the CP/M-68k machine, is to emulate TOS (only the `normal' bits, 
not BIOS..) in order to run compilers etc.

Anyway, CP/M-68k STINKS. It does allow for disk change without reboot, but 
that's about the only improvement in usability over CP/M 2.0. I can't
even write a terminal emulator, since the standard BIOS doesn't have 
status info. for the serial line(s), arrrghh.

I though TOS was basically CP/M-68K plus GEM and a bunch of extra functions
in the ROM I/O system (xios?).

Have you considered porting MINIX-ST to the CP/M machine?

Gosh, sounds like you 'have several of them'.

The Televideos used a DB15 RS-422 arrangement to communicate to the server,
and it sounds suspicously like the cards you're trying to get info on are
the cards that you are looking for.

Yes, as far as I can see. The emulation of TOS on a CP/M-68k machine would
mainly consist of remapping the traps (I'd probably have to redo some
arguments - trap numbers etc) as the functionality is there. Also, all
the things that you *can't* do on CP/M-68k would have to be caught.. .

>Have you considered porting MINIX-ST to the CP/M machine?

Yes, but I don't have the time. The only problem is that I can't (easily) 
get to the I/O system, since it's tied to a Z80 computer. The machine is
basically a HUGE Z80 computer with a 68000 board tagged on top, communicating
through shared memory (the machine is a SORD M68). It would be fun though,
although my enthusiasm for the machine slumped somewhat when my experimental
CP/M 80 system zeroed the disk block containing the directory on my 
working disk..... (those were the days...).

Of course you're right. In fact, it wouldn't be an emulation at all
but could be a "native" operating system. However, the point of 
emulating CP/M-80 was to allow people who had CP/M machines to 
migrate to the Atari without discarding all of their CP/M-80
software. In fact, the emulator is nearly as fast as my 2.5 MHz
Z80 machine and screen and disk I/O is much faster. Transferring
the software is my only holdup to getting rid of the real CP/M
machine.

As an aside, I worked with Andy Mickel here at Apollo for a couple
of years -- I can see him saying that :-)

Several people have recommended checking the drive rotational speed.
Certainly try that first (I recommend using a flourescent light if there
is a timing disk on the hub pulley underneath the drive).  There will be
a 10 turn potentiometer on the motor control board to adjust the speed of
the motor.  Don't adjust the wrong one if there is no separate motor
control board.

If you really need to align the drive, you will need an alignment 
diskette.  This is a specially recorded analog diskette which cannot
be duplicated by regular (digital) drives.  You will also need an
oscilloscope which can invert one channel and add the two channels
together to produce a single trace on the screen.  This is not 'x-y'
mode, but a regular sweep mode with the two channels summed together.
Connect the two probes to the differential inputs from the drive side
1 preamplifier and sync the sweep on the index pulse.  Insert the
alignment diskette, start the drive and step to track 16. Adjust 
your scope and you will see a pattern on the screen resembling a 
pair of cats eyes, or a butterfly if you prefer.  The idea is to 
loosen the retaining screw on the stepper, and move the head until 
the two 'lobes' of the pattern are as close to the same height as 
possible.  Tighten down the screw and make sure the pattern hasn't
changed (this will probably take a few tries till you get the hang
of it).  Now unload the drive head so you can move the scope probes
to the side 2 preamplifier and check the alignment of the other
head.  It is extremely rare that head 2 will be out of alignment
with head 1, but if it is, you're in trouble.  There is no good
way to adjust head 2, as it is (usually) simply screwed to head
1 and you will have to remove the aligment diskette, make a blind
adjustment, and take a reading to see if you hit the mark.

If you feel like you want to go through with this, I can get you the
part number for the alignment diskette. Heck, I might just send you
mine, since I no longer feel it is cost effetive to align 5.25"
drives.  The whole procedure is likely to take you a couple of
hours if it is your first time, and replacement drives can be had
for $50.  Incidently, if you buy an alignment diskette, it will
cost you $35.

Your system may be a XEROX 820-II or 16/8 microcomputer. The 820-II has a Z80
processor and runs CP/M80 version 2.2.  A lot of good software is available for
the 820-II. Much of it is in the public domain and is available in the SIMTEL20
CP/M Archives. Commercial software is also available through mail order.
Central Computer Products of Fillmore, California, is an excellent source.

The XEROX 16/8 is really an 820-II with an Intel 8086 coprocessor. This micro
is capable of running CP/M86 and MS-DOS in addition to CP/M80. There isn't
much available software for CP/M86 and only generic MS-DOS applications will
run on the 16/8, provided the machine has enough RAM. The 16/8 can do multi-
processing, allowing two programs to execute simultaneously - one on the Z80
running CP/M80, the other on the 8086 running CP/M86. I have a 16/8 micro and
wanted to take advantage of this feature. But, because there isn't much CP/M86
software available, I have replaced my 8086 with a V30 chip which is able to
run a CP/M80 emulator under CP/M86. Now I can run two CP/M80 programs at once,
and have more available RAM for some CP/M80 applications, like Supercalc, that
can use it.

The way to boot the system is to place a bootable disk in drive A, press "L"
and the enter key. (Insert the disk with the label to the right). Try this with
all your disks, until one works. Some of those disks may be bootable as well.

I hope this information is of some help.

There is something of a communications gap here. I bought an Amstrad because
it was cheap and because I thought that there'd be lots of good CP/M software
available. It turns out to be quite difficult to get the stuff, I've never
seen anything about Z-system on it until recently in this newsgroup, and
even the UK CP/M user group aren't very helpful as they have trouble with

As most of the magazines want more contributors maybe Jay should have tried

Does anyone know whether 'JC-Systems', a company that made S100
CPU and SCSI boards (z80 and 64180) and used to be advertised in
MicroSystems magazine, is still in operation, has moved, changed their
name or is out of business?
Picked up a number of their boards at a garage sale and would like to

I have downloaded the files Spell21.lbr and spell21x.lbr from simtel.
They seem to work as advertised, but the dictionary (dict.dic) seems to be
missing some common words, like 'for.'  I can't recompile the dictionary with
dictionary compiler because the raw dictionary is too big to fit on a disk.

I tried the seperate file in the same directory (dict.dic) but had the same
results.  Is this software disagreeing with my computer? (Osborne Exec)

Has anyone else had a similar problem with this program?  I could try and find
an alternate (smaller) dictionary, but I cannot be sure that they will have
all of the forms of the words that this package has.  

Any ideas?

disks which will work in my 96tpi 80tk ds dd Tandon TM101-4 drives which
Montezuma Micro CP/M will format to 820K.  I just bought a box of Kodak MD"-HD

the verify pass.  These disks are made for high density drives (1.2Meg).
 
In the past, I have found Radio Shack 80tk 5.25" disks to work well, and also

Yes, there is a communications gap, but I could not figure out how to break
through.  When I sent contributions to magazines in Europe (even had one
written in German -- checked by a German colleague of mine), I never even
got replies.  The same was true of all the magazines, user groups, and
dealers to whom "press kits" about Z-System were sent, especially in
England.  There seemed to be no interest in CP/M developments at all, or at
least not from a foreign source.

As far as getting software is concerned, it IS quite easy.  Besides me,
Elliam Associates will gladly convert software from one diskette format to
another, including Amstrad.  I am quite sure that they sell their CP/M
product line in Amstrad format, as does Sage Microsystems.

>> As most of the magazines want more contributors maybe Jay should have

>> there ? Mind you it's probably a bit late now.

As I commented above, I tried submitting something a couple of times, but
there was never even an acknowledgment.  Writing articles, as I do regularly
for The Computer Journal, is an enormous amount of work, and I was not about
to continue doing that when there was no response.

After I joined the Amstrad SIG in the U.S., I sent information about Z-
System along with a special offer to just about all the activists in the
group.  One member took the trouble to write to me to tell me that CP/M-Plus
already did everything that Z-System does (I took this as an indicator of
the level of technical understanding and expertise in that community).
There was only one of the activists who showed any interest, and he told me
that my impression of the rest of the community as he had seen it was
basically correct.

There are, of course, some exceptions (besides you and me), but the number
appears to be remarkably small.  They probably have no way of knowing about
each other, because the magazines and user groups do not address their
interests.  I have gotten a number of requests from people in Great Britain
for names of other people with a strong technical interest in CP/M-
compatible computing, and I have been happy to try to hook those people up.

For many years I traveled to Germany and Switzerland trying to find or
encourage the formation of 8-bit user groups.  I never had much luck, though
I am ecstatic that there is now a very active group in Germany, led by
Helmut Jungkunz.  Soon we will start to see new Z-System programs
contributed by European programmers.

Message-ID: <859@iceman.jcu.oz>

The question was:  what sort of disks to use in a DSQD drive for
820k.  The poster tried HD disks, and they didn't work.  Not
surprising:  HD disks have greater coercivity, meaning they are 
more resistant to magnetisation, and need stronger write flux.  This
allows more sectors/track without adjacent regions affecting one another
What you really want are DSQD disks, certified for quad density.  I
haven't seen these advertised for some time, but not to worry--I've thus
far used over 150 DSDD disks at 720k in a TEAC quad drive and have had
no failures, despite using a variety of no-name generic disks.  If you
are a worrier, run a verify program after formatting.  DSQD disks, when
they were available, were simply standard disks that had been tested
at quad density.

Swap the 1.2M discs with someone using an AT clone. They have a different
oxide coating from regular discs, which is why you had a formatting
problem. 

The easiest thing to do is buy DSDD 360K discs. There is no difference
between these and "certified" 80tk floppies other than the certification.
For that matter, all the single and double side single and double
density discs are cut from the same sheet of media, including 48tpi
and 96tpi. I've never had any problems using DSDD floppies for 80tk
drives, and in fact have always bought the cheapest name-brand disc
I could find. (The absolute cheapest is probably not a good idea, I
at least want some idea of the manufacturers' background.)

The manufacturers punch a pile of "biscuits", as the media is called,
and start certifying at the highest level the media is capable of until
they fill their orders for this batch. Then, they step down to the
next lower level until it's filled, and so on. At worst, I think you'll
find 1 disc in 20 that won't format correctly, which is bunches cheaper
than Radio Shack 80tk discs.

Subject: Lance's T's question about quad dens disks..

Dear Lance....

since this probably is of general interest....
Single and Double-density disketts have a lower magnetic hysteresis and
are easier for read/write heads to maniplulate the magnetic particles.
Quad-density disks are higher, and corresponds to metal cassette tapes,
you can read them all day long, but you can't record onto them since the
normal cassette tapes can't "flip" the magnets on the tape.

It seems like your drive is of the lower density version, and the disks are
of a higher dens.  I got this from the info-dec-micro list, by the way.

I use el cheapos from Babbages, double dens double sided, and my VT180
single dens single sided loves them.  I tried "flippies" for a while,
but disk management becomes a problem..  hope this helps!!!!

My original reply did not go through for some reason.

Others have spoken up about this, but I thought I would still add my 2
cents.  As was said, the Xerox 820 computer (820, 820-II, or 16/8) do NOT
have an option on power up for "wordprocessor".  The Xerox 820 gives you
two options; "typewriter" and "load".  The Xerox 820-II (and 16/8) give you
those two options, plus "terminal".

In addition, as someone pointed out, this could be an 860, which was a CP/M
based word processing "work station".  Because this system has two drives
(and three power up options), I suspect it is an 820-II.  It's been a while
since I have seen one (and I never used one), but I think the Xerox 860 had
only one drive.

David, get in touch with me.  I can get you a system disk for any one of
the Xerox 820 computers.

In additon, I receintly got some software and the users manuals for the
Xerox 860 (I bought an old 820-II, and this stuff was included with it).
If anyone needs information on them, maybe I can now help.

Assuming you have Internet access:

ftp wsmr-simtel20.army.mil
user: anonymous

This is a TOPS system.  You'll find the CP/M stuff by:

cd pd2:<cpm>

To transfer binary files you'll need to use the 'tenex' file type.

I have a Morrow Micro-decision with a 96tpi DSDD drive.  The Non-HD 96tpi
diskettes are out there.  I've seen them in some well stocked office 
supply stores.  In the past I've gotten Memorex 96tpi DSDD diskettes mailorder.
I've also gotten Dysan 96tpi DSDD diskettes special order from friendly
computer stores (stay away from Whole Earth).

The CP/M User Group (UK) aka. CPMMSDOSUGUK is a good source of technical

will recover.

I wrote them an article on the Z-system some time last year, but haven't
