When Mike tries to run his serial port above 1200 baud, characters 
begin dropping out of the text.  The system works very well at 1200
or below.  Different terminal programs have been tried, as well as 
different modems.

When logged onto a vax running unix, the vax understands all characters
sent from the Kaypro, but the display still drops characters.

Has anyone seen this problem?  And does any one have a fix?

Thanks.

What terminal does the Osborne I emulate?  I have an original tan-case with
the official double-density and 80/104 column upgrades.  I recall reading in
an old issue of The Portable Companion that the O1 emulated a tvi920.  However,
using this driver results in 1) control codes being displayed on the screen, 
and 2) no line-feeds.  If you're using an O1 to communicate with another
system and you've got a terminal emulation that works, please let me know.

Thanks.

I had a KP 2x (1984) with the same "feature".  The graphics screen monitor
is so slow that it cannot keep up above 1200 baud.  Microcornucopia sells
a new ROM for Kaypros which is supposed to get you up to about 4800 baud.
The problem is with the line feed portion of the memory mapped I/O.  From
the time that you issue a LF at 9600 baud until the routine returns, you 
have "missed" 3 or 4 characters at the modem port.

A possibility is to modify your modem 7 clone or kermit to issue an XOFF
just before you do a line feed to shut off the incoming characters, do the
LF, and then XON to continue receiving. (Your host will hate you.)

What you really need is an asynchronous modem port handler.  Check with the
local Kaypro gurus and see if there is one.  The problem can't be all that
rare that someone hasn't done something.

Good luck.

taking an alternate route to solve the problem).

And now for my question:  Is there a way to take a Kaypro 2/4 and modify
it to be IBM compatible?  I've heard rumors to this effect, but as
yet I've gotten no names of places that'll do it.

Thanks again,

I have had similar problems using a friend's '2 on a VAX under VMS.  I
could do like 3600 if I turned up the NULLS, but the problem then was
his monitor displayed them as /@@@@/ for however many I turned on, which
loses.

Are you familar with Micro Cornucopia magazine ?  Amongst their
public doman collections for the Kaypro is a terminal program that does
the Right Thing for Kaypros (whatever that is) so I could run 9600 no
problem without nulls.  The Micro-8 monitor ROM upgrade (?!) from the 
same folks also took care of the null-echo problem.

If you don't have an address I can go find it and post it.

If you don't have any luck getting an answer (or if someone out there has
an "unknown" type) we could compile a list of say, all known DEL EOL
sequences and you could just write a program to try them all until one
connected...

The Osborne I (brown case) emulates the old televideo 920.  I have used
the standard TERMCAP for the tvi920 with the columns modified to 51 for
four years, and been able to use the Rand editor and play rogue (under a
version that thought 51 columns was okay) and do other heavy cursor
package routines from home with a hayes modem at 1200 baud and the public
domain OTERM terminal package.

Hope that helps.

to figure out the parameters for the Ampro so it can read and write disks
from an Apple (running CP/M) and an AT&T 6300 (also running CP/M).  If you
have twiddled with the Ampro's disk formats before, please let me know what
your experience has been.

This doesn't qualify as a Public Domain entry, but the price is
so low, it's almost stealing.

I have used the MIX editor that you've seen advertised everywhere
for $29 with great success. 

My system: in case it's important, is a Lobo Max-80.  It is a 5 Mhz
Z80-based system w/128k RAM, 2 serial ports, built-in 5" and 8" floppy
drivers, as well as SASI H.D. interface, Real Time Clock, etc.
It runs Radio Shack MIII programs (under LDOS) and also runs CPM 2.2
and CPM PLUS (3.0).

I won't clutter up the net with a lot of specs (unless someone requests
specific information), but this Editor made it possible for me to use
CPM effectively. Previously, I was not able to do very much in the way
of programming, lacking a decent editor.

Quickie, condensed specs:  all of the commands are based on those that
Micropro's Wordstar uses. They are just about exactly the same.  If you
don't like that, you can change all the key bindings. This thing does
windows, multiple files, long files, split screens, etc.  You can set
up initialization files so that different versions are available.
It has a very nice Macro command facility.

Quite a bargain for $29 bucks!

Usual disclaimer: I have no vested interest in this company, am just
a satisfied user.

Keywords: Greatest Public Domain Program ever.
To:       info-cpm@AMSAA.ARPA

This posting is in response to an article requesting information on
running CPM applications under MS-DOS (not for him, for his sister :-)
One response suggested a V20 chip, but that really doesn't help, because
that only handles the 8080 instructions (most CPM machines are Z80) and
also does not provide you with the BDOS interface critical to any CPM
program. But there is a good solution:

Tell your sister it *is* possible to run almost any program from a true
CPM environment, where "true" is defined as one that does not depend on
any hardware specific features of the system it was running under. The
efficiency of the operation depends on your implementation.

1) FREE: This is the method I use. It is also the slowest method, but
   has some side benefits I find irresistable, besides the price. There
   is a public domain program that fully implements the Z80 instruction
   set and all the relevant CPM BDOS calls. It also provides a VT52
   emulator which may be turned on or off with a simple command. You can
   suspend your CPM task at any time and examine memory, debug, set break
   points, disassemble, even execute a DOS subshell, and then pick up
   execution where it left off. In fact it includes a very flexible and
   complete symbolic debugger as part of the "CPM" environment, which
   even has an option to generate an output file that may be recompiled
   with MAC80 to create the original COM file. Variables and labels are
   assigned on the fly or read from an initialization file.

   I have run DbaseII, SuperCalc, Laboratory Microsystems FORTH, Turbo
   pascal and MS-BASIC under the shell with no problems. You get a
   63k TPA, too, which I have never seen in any *real* CPM system!
   Utilities like STAT, directory sorters, and the like don't work, they
   make no sense given the environment you are in. You use the resident
   PC utilities for that stuff by prefixing it with "!" (just like the
   big boys on Unix Ma!).

   For number crunching we are hurting in this department. A typical PC
   at 4.77Mhz benchmarks at the equivalent of a 250 Khz Z80 CPU, not too
   impressive (or impressive in a negative sense of the word :-). File
   access is done in native mode, so it is alot better. On my 8Mhz AT
   the emulator benchmarks at 1.2 Mhz equivalent Z80 speed, but the file
   access is so much faster that my Dbase applications run at the same
   speed they did under my 4Mhz Z80 CPM system. And that was the original
   reason *I* was interested in this.

   If anyone is interested in this program, E-mail me and we can setup
   some way to get it to you. I won't send it over the net, it is too big.
   But you could download it from me, or send me a disk, or something.

2) <$100: Buy the V20 chip and one of the commercial emulators that provide
   emulation of the missing Z80 opcodes and the CPM environment. Total cost
   will be very nearly $100. From a speed standpoint this solution is vastly
   superior. From a compatibility standpoint, somewhat less so. I tried this
   method first, and was disappointed. Besides not haveing the great
   environment of (1), allowing DOS execution and debugging, there was
   generally a poor user interface and compatibility problem. Without going
   into a more lengthy discussion, I found that some packages would work in
   one environment and not in another. Some packages require you to go to
   painfull contortions to get the application up and running.

3) >$250: Buy a Z80 host board and plug it into your PC. I am currently
   considering this option. Logically you could expect the best of all
   worlds in this case. You have a true Z80 processor, with it's own
   memory, and it only depends on the PC for doing it's I/O. You 
   could have *real* CPM running on this hummer! At 8 Mhz! I have seen
   several different boards to do this, the cheapest one which seems to
   have the capabilities I would be looking for is advertised in last
   months Byte magazine for only $199. The catch here is that you are
   dependant on how they wrote their BIOS as to whether you have a really
   useable system. I don't have any experience with the company, so I
   can't really say how good it is likely to be, but if you are not 
   in a hurry, I will probably be buying this system and I could post a 
   review to the net. For about $600-$800 you can get the original "Blue"
   board, which has a good reputation for compatibility.

Hope this helps!!

        PMATE can be obtained, please?  Particularly, outside the USA.

	What sounds like an even greater deal is their current
package price for both the editor and their C compiler...does
anybody know whether their compiler is any good???  They claim
its a complete C...how about code size and compile times.  If
anybody has any experience with their compiler I, for one,
would like to heare about it.  I'm currently looking for
a decent C for my Z80 CP/M system that's not too costly.
$55 sounds pretty good.

In a previous article, Dick (kodak!gardner) Gardner sang the
praises of the MIX editor ($30 through MIX Software), and I
thought I should give equal time to an opposing view.  I bought
the MIX editor about a year ago and had all sorts of problems
with it.  A quick look at it with a debugger, and the setting
up of a new stack pointer at the beginning of the program helped
some of the more serious (random) crashes, but I still had some
problems with it.  It seemed to crash if you reached the end of
the memory buffer without _manually_ swapping buffers, it took
_forever_ to do a block move, there was no easy way to back up
in large files, and it would occasionally go away at random
times.  I have renamed it to the MIXmaster editor and stuffed
it into a drawer somewhere.  I called the company to tell them
about my partial fix (the stack pointer) and they denied there
was a problem, treated me like an idiot {I may be one, but I
resent the attitude of 'there couldn't be anything wrong with
_our_ software, dummy'}, and made me call their 'technical'
line (my dime) with my bug report.
	Admittedly, this is a (potentially) wonderful program, as
when it was working, it worked really well, I was able to set
it up about halfway between RSX KED and Wordstar, and was very
powerful and extensable.  However, unexplained random crashes
and serious problems with large files made me put it aside and
purchase Wordstar...
	My system is a (primarily) Compupro S-100 machine running
CP/M 2.2N with (at the time) 64K, 6MHz Z-80, no interrupts, and
2 8 inch floppies.

Subject:   Looking for a good C compiler

I am looking into learning C and I wondered if anyone would have
any suggestions on what compilers are worthwhile.  I have the
following requirements arranged in some sort of order of importance:

1.  Cheap.
2.  I would like a unit that is also available for the IBM PC because
    I am slowly rebuilding my system to be 8088 based.
3.  Something with at least a rotten tutorial since I've never used
    the language.

I have been looking into a compiler from MIX corp. and Dr Dobb's
small Compiler.  If anyone has any comments about these, I'd love to
hear them!

Thanks in advance,
Rob

Subject: Mix C+ 

There is a review of Mix C in the June 86 issue of BYTE magazine.  May I add
that I own a copy for CP/M-80 and have found that it works in general, though
a bit slower than Aztec C; the generated code is somewhat more bulky and runs
more slowly too.  It also has some strange characteristics for the unwary -
for example, string substitutions (from #defines) eat up the whitespace 
following the token to be replaced, and if the replacement string does not
include a trailing comment, no whitespace is replaced. E.G.:

#define EXTERN extern
EXTERN int noodle;

expands to:

externint noodle;

Which, of course, generates a compiler error.  The solution is to add a comment
to the end of the #define with intervening whitespace:

#define EXTERN extern /**/

Also, it's treatment of comments is somewhat nonstandard - I believe something
like this blows off:

	/*commented out		inode++; /*increment node pointer*/

All in all, such things wouldn't bother you once you know about them, but they
are a pain if trying to port a program written for another compiler.  So for
$40.00, you probably get more than you pay for, though not everything you always
wanted, and there is a huge book included (not the best C tutorial I've
ever seen, but acceptable).  Suggest you read the Byte article for more
details on the cans and cannots.

Sincerely,

Keith - I just FTPed the whole directory and started unsqueezing all squeezed
files.  Two of them, "dpinst.mqc" and "nswpt.mac" failed to unsqueeze, and
caused a UNIX error.  The UNIX error is an artifact of the particular
unsqueezer program I am using, but the cause is real enough:  There is a
high-bit set in the name-field at the beginning of each file.  I used a UNIX
file-dumper program (od -h filename) to make this determination.  It is
interesting to note that the TOPS-20 unsqueezer is able to deal with this
situation.  I copied and unsqueezed the files on SIMTEL20 without difficulty.

Keywords:MIX C compiler, speed, size
To:       info-cpm@AMSAA.ARPA

I am not an expert on C compilers, but I did buy and use the MIX C and
found it to be adequate for the programs that I write. (Occasional)

The main concern about MIX C is that it compiles into psuedo-code, and
requires a run-time support package, which translates to a rather large
code size.  The run-time package can exist separately or be included in
the program.    

Included in the package are utilities to optimize for size and/or speed.
MIX C programs run noticeably slower than those that create assembler
source, naturally.  A simple test of a software timing loop resulted in
code 1/4 the speed of Aztec C, for example.  Keep in mind that the
cost is about 1/3.

It is a full-blown implementation of C, with some nice enhancements.
The tutorial/manual is excellent, with sensible examples, and clear
explanations.

All in all, the package is certainly worth $59.

If you're in to programming, Borlunds Turbo Pascal and Turbo Toolbox (or
Database Toolbox) is well worth the investment.  Mail order is cheapest.
The source code supplied will allow you to create B-Tree type indexes
that provide almost immediate look-up and access of very large files.

Subject:  Posting software directly to info-cpm or net.micro.cpm:

Fellow CP/Mers - On the 19th of July I went on a one week vacation.  While I
was gone, a revolutionary thing happened on this list: messages with sizes in
the thirty to forty thousand byte range containing software encoded for
transmission via mail channels started showing up.  Now, I am beginning to
receive queries from info-cpm readers wanting to know what's going on.

     To understand this reaction, one must recall some fairly recent history:
For at least the last several years (the time during which I have been
maintaining this list), we have from time to time received requests from the
USENET community to not post messages containing tens of thousands of
characters because much of the USENET relies on dialup telephone connections
for transmission, and these telephone calls cost money.  Similar requests have
been heard from the DDN side because info-cpm is a mail-list, and some readers
have accounts that are subject to disk storage quotas.  I can personally
attest that this is a problem for some people, because I must from time
to time temporarily delete people from the list because they have gone on
vacation (or whatever) and their mail has built up to the point that their
disk quotas have been exceeded, causing all subsequent mail to be rejected
(which causes automated "nastygrams" to be returned to me as list maintainer,
and to originators of messages to info-cpm).

     But during this same time, a very important evolution has occurred:
"mail-only" connections have been established between the DDN and several
other networks.  And thus, a significant number of people using these networks
have begun receiving info-cpm (and net.micro.cpm via the automatic message
forwarding service provided by the Army Ballistic Research Laboratory).  Many
of these people are from overseas (England, Germany, Norway, Denmark, Sweden
and Holland come to mind).  And at a time when we are hearing that "CP/M is
dead", the enthusiasm of these people seems to suggest that some sort of
"rebirth" of CP/M may be occurring overseas.  Now imagine (if you're not one
of them) how frustrating it must be for these new readers to constantly read
messages describing the wealth of free software available from SIMTEL20 to
those of us using hosts connected to the DDN.  (Readers in the CSNET and
USENET, into which info-cpm has been relayed for some time, don't have to
imagine how this feels; THEY KNOW.)  As far as these "outsiders" are
concerned, SIMTEL20 might as well be on the planet Pluto.

     To deal with this situation as best I can, I have created separate
"welcome" messages to be sent to new info-cpm subscribers.  The one for the
DDN people contains the "archive blurb" (a sort of SIMTEL20 archives
handbook), while the one for non-DDN readers explains that the archives are
not available to them, and includes the nice writeup by Jeff Edelheit
describing alternate sources for much of this software.  Also, when I update
the blurb, I limit the distribution of the new version to DDN subscribers
so as not to burden the non-DDN people with something that can only be a
source of frustration.  I wish I could do more, but I don't know how.

     So given this situation, along come some folks who have worked up CP/M
versions of programs used in the UNIX world to transmit groups of files (the
functional equivalent of a CP/M archive) and encoded binary files via ordinary
mail channels.  AND all this stuff can be processed on UNIX machines before
downloading to a micro.  Suddenly, there is a ray of hope for the hordes of
"disenfranchised" readers, and from the limited reactions I have seen so far
THEY LOVE IT!

     Now the idea of sending software via mail and news-feed channels is not
new:  This has been going on in newsgroups like the USENET's net.sources for
quite a while.  But USENET sites can arrange to not receive selected
newsgroups if the disk storage or transmission costs are more than they wish
to bear.  I would not like to see info-cpm dumped into the "bit bucket" for
such a reason.  Frankly, I am surprised that I have not seen "screams of
anguish" from the USENET community in response to the recent high-volume
activity in info-cpm/net.micro.cpm.  Maybe everybody has fat wallets and huge
disks these days...

     So what to do?  It has been suggested that a separate USENET newsgroup,
something like "net.cpm.sources", could be established.  This would be a nice
solution for USENET, I think, because it would allow each site the option I
mentioned above.  But it would not do much for people in other networks.  What
other possibilities are there?  And is anyone willing to VOLUNTEER to provide
some sort of archive service in the other networks (I believe BITNET has
something going now, but I don't really know anything about it)?  And most
important, how do you feel about direct software distribution via info-cpm.

     I realize that asking these questions is likely to start a free-for-all,
but I think this is a really important issue.  It is, for example, conceivable
that the info-cpm <-> net.micro.cpm message forwarding service might have to
be discontinued if things get really out of control, but I in my opinion this
would be EXTREMELY UNDESIRABLE.  I am not implying that such a move is at
all imminent; it is NOT.  But we are faced with an important policy decision
concerning how we want our newsgroup to operate.  This issue is muddied
somewhat by the "government interest".  The US Army provides considerable
resources to maintain the SIMTEL20 archives, and info-cpm is one of the
channels through which the contents of those archives are made known to
government users.  So I think the Government has some rights regarding how
this list is operated, although I'm not sure what they are.  I hope Frank
Wancho will comment on this.

     So please send your comments and opinions regarding this matter to the
list as a whole, and not just to me as list maintainer.  I think this needs to
be an open discussion.  And please "make sure your brain is running before
putting your mouth (or fingers, in this case) in gear".  There are diverse
interests at stake here, and this is not a trivial question.  Let's do the
best we can.

Subject:  [Keith Petersen:  Bad files in <CPM.TURBODOS-SIGI>]

Fellow CP/Mers - A couple days ago I sent Keith Petersen a message (with a
copy to this list) describing what I perceived to be a problem with certain
squeezed files in the <CPM> archive.  Basically, when I tried to unsqueeze
these files on a BSD 4.2 UNIX system, I got a core dump.  The problem was
being caused by high-bits set in the filename field inside the squeezed file.
The contents of this field are read during unsqueezing, and determine the
filename under which the unsqueezed file will be stored.  When UNIX tried to
create files having high-bits set in the filename, it really "lost it".  Here
is Keith's reply to my message:


----- Forwarded message # 1:

Subject: Bad files in <CPM.TURBODOS-SIGI>

Dave, the UnSQueezer program is supposed to strip off the high order
bits of the filenames in case they had any CP/M attributes set when
they were LBR'ed.  This was added to the specification for USQ some
time ago after some SysOps started using attributes inside LBRs for
certain controls over privacy and downloading by callers.

--Keith

----- End of forwarded messages

     The unsqueezer I have been using is from <UNIX.CPM>XUSQ107.C in the
SIMTEL20 <UNIX> archive.  A look at the source code reveals that the high-
bits of the filename characters are indeed not being stripped.  The fix is
very simple.  Here it is:

	p = origname;				/* Get original file name */
	do {					/* send it to array */
		*p = getc(in);
		*p &= 0177;    <---------------- ADD THIS LINE
	} while(*p++ != '\0');


The new line goes after line number 136 (at least in my copy).

     I don't know whether a similar change would be desirable for XTYPE107.C
and/or XSQ107.C as I haven't looked.  If you would like to know whether the
unsqueezer you are using can handle filenames having CP/M attribute (high)
bits set, grab a copy of <CPM.TURBODOS-SIGI>DPINST.MQC from SIMTEL20 and try
to unsqueeze it.

     Thanks for your help, Keith.

What is distasteful about posting software to the list are all the negatives
that Dave mentioned plus:

Software ends up being "kept" in two places and in two different forms.  Thus
DDN users (who may have just joined the group and haven't received previous
mail) must not only "look" at the CP/M,CPMUG,and SIGM directories on SIMTEL
where software is stored in it's natural form (files), but must also "look"
for more software embedded throughout the mail archives.  One cannot, un-
fortunately, even if he knew the subject line or date of a pertinent mailing
which contained software, ftp a single mail item from the mail archives, but
must retrieve a whole year's mail and then edit through it to separate out
the software of interest.  Also, this form of storage is very inefficient:
instead of taking up less space than the original file (i.e. by using sq, lu,
or arc), software ends up taking much *more* space than the original file
because it's encoded.  In other words, though there may be reasons to do
it for the non-DDN community, it is clearly detrimental to the DDN side.

Gee, Keith, I've been using the unsqueezer from <cpm.squ-port> it seems like

and this is the first file I've heard of it doesn't work with.  With this
program, under UNIX 4.1BSD, you get a file name with a ? in it that you can't

Does this problem affect any version of "usq" running under CP/M?

In-reply-to: Msg of 7 Aug 1986  09:06-MDT from prindle at nadc.ARPA

Frank has brought up a very important point.  The INFO-CPM mail
archives are also stored here (in PS:<ARCHIVES.CPM>) from Day 1 (less
some holes), completely unedited, except to occassionally split the
current file into "manageable" chunks.  We also hold the mail archives
for 18 other mailing lists.  The intent is to keep all archives
online.  However, with disk space currently at a premium, the
duplication would quickly use up whatever's left.

So, from our standpoint, we would much rather prefer a new spin-off
list be formed, ala net.sources or mod.sources, perhaps named either
net.micro.cpm.sources or net.sources.cpm or mod.sources.cpm, or
whatever is correct by the prevailing convention(s), and leave
net.micro.cpm off that newsgroup, please.

With all of the wizzards out there, there aught to be
a demon that accepts mail with a path/filename in it.
This demon takes the path/filename, goes into the simtel20
archive, gets the file, encodes it, and mails it back out.
The only person effected, is the requestor. Is something like this
possible? even if only parts of it are demonable, maybe it 
would be much easier for someone to keep up?

Your question re Kaypro-->PClone modification is something I've 
wondered about.  The SWP board is more useful as a ramdisk than as
a MSDOS system--I have the 256k version, and it's great under CP/M,
but almost completely IBM-uncompatible, and there is very little
truly generic software around for MSDOS.  However, just because SWP
hasn't done it doesn't mean it can't be done:  A Kaypro provides
almost all of the parts you would need to build a PClone, except for
the motherboard--a nice sturdy case, power supply, keyboard (which
would need either modification or a tricky BIOS), two disk drives,
and an external-synch monitor.  It also has a large base of installed
systems, many of the owners of which are feeling that the world is
passing them by.  A clever hardware person ought to be able to install
one of these 'little-board' style all-in-one (serial, parallel
interfaces and pseudo color- or mono- graphics adapter all on the
board) motherboards in a Kaypro case for little more than the cost of 
the board.  A REALLY clever hardware/software person could probably
even build in Z80 support so the Kaypro could continue to fulfill
its original role.  I suspect that a kit of this sort could sell
briskly for around $400-500 and make someone a mint.

	The answer to your question is 'sort of'.  SWP makes (made?) a piggy
back board that contained an 8088  and 256/512K of memory.  It gave you a ram
disk in Kaypro mode, and allowed you to run MS-DOS on the 8088.  NOTE this does
not mean IBM compatible.  It had no graphics, and the memory map doesn't look
at all like the IBM.  It will run MS-DOS software, not IBM software.  This
constitutes around 10% of the total IBM software.  WordStar 3.0 would run, but
not 3.3, DBase II, but not DBase III etc.  The reason for this is the IBM is
*SLOW* and people found the only way to get decient speed out of the beast  was
to blow the DOS away and drive the hardware directly, added to this MS-DOS has
no graphics support in it, and you'll see that not very much IBM software is
going to run on the thing.

I have an Ampro Little Board, and have read and written a wide variety of 
disks on it.  Don't know about the ATT box, it came out since I stopped using
that machine as my primary (own a unix box now, you know how it is...).  I
wish you luck with the Apple disks though, the controller uses an entirely
different concept for storing information on the disk.  I've not seen a 
standard disk drive ever be able to read/write from one.  I worked for a 
dealer for a while, and so aquired a bunch of apple hardware.  Neat, but
very incompatible with the rest of the world.

We used the MIX compiler for the PC in a consulting job a while back, and were
not very happy with it.  I wasn't using it myself, so comments are all at 
least second hand, but I think the docs were poor, and the compatibility with
other C compilers seemed to be lacking.  Again, this was about a year ago, and
I wasn't the one hacking with it.

SmallC is fun, and a neat way to learn the language, but I feel it is 
insufficient for doing any "real", large applications.  Sources have been
posted a couple times, and I'm sure you can get an executable by asking 
around.

I used the C/80 compiler for CP/M for quite a while, and was pretty happy with
it.  It can be purchased with the floating point stuff and a good tutorial for
about $100 from several places.  I got mine from Sprite Software, I think.

Currently, the compiler I use the most is the Aztec family from Manx.  The
fact that versions are available for a wide variety of targets is a big plus.
I've got the CP/M and MS-Dos versions, both seem to work pretty well.  Good
correlation with the 4.2bsd compiler, and a fair set of runtimes.  
Unfortunately, Aztec compilers are NOT cheap. 

In any case, get a copy of Kernighan and Ritchie's "The C Programming 
Language"... there may be better tutorials around, and there may be more
complete references for modern compilers, but my graphic-designer girlfriend
learned C with it... and gave it high marks for understandability.

assume that you're aware that you can assign a footer message in

It seems to me that there is a simple solution (if everyone goes
along).  That is to split the source distribution on Usenet off from
the main list (call it net.micro.cpm.source or net.source.cpm or
whatever they want to use), then to gateway that list in the same way
that the main list is now, but as a seperate list.  All of the non-DDN
subscribers will probably want to be on the list as well as some on
the DDN side.  It would also be useful if someone in the DDN world
would extract useful things and submit them to the archive, but I
suspect the more useful entries will end up there eventually anyway.

A more elaborate form of this might be to allow some automated
procedure to extract items from the "sources" list and keep them
somewhere for a while.  Then people submitting source could send a
note to the main list and DDN types could get a copy of useful stuff
without being required to receive and store it all.  This is similar
to the way many UNIX (tm) sites handle net.sources now.

Fellow CP/Mers - Thanks to all who have contributed to this discussion so
far.  The comments have all been quite thoughtful and reasonable, in my
opinion.  With this note, I am relaying a message sent to me at the list
maintainer's address for the reason stated therein.  This message, like some
others, suggests an approach that would require the development of some new
software.  Assuming that a host to run some special software (not necessarily
exactly as described here, but something new) were available, does anyone care
to volunteer to write such software?

Dave,
I am sending this to you rather than the whole list because:

1. It is long.
2. It may be totally out in left field!

If you think it has any merit, then by all means post it to INFO-CPM and/or
INFO-ADA.  But if you think I'm crazy, tell me so, 'cause I still have plenty
to learn about networks.

Incidentally, if for no other reason, CP/M re-birth may be attributed partially
to the Commodore 128.  That's certainly why I'm here!

Thanks,
Frank Prindle

--------------------------------Cut Here--------------------------------------
I know I have gotten requests to help non-DDN people get selective pieces of
software from the SIMTEL20 archives.  To do this manually, while tolerable in
extreme moderation, is impossible on any sort of large scale.  On the other
hand, wholesale distribution of software over the INFO-xxx mailing lists is
just not practical.

There is, perhaps, a technical solution to the problem of how to allow non-DDN
network users to submit software to, and extract software from, the SIMTEL20
public domain archives (CP/M, MSDOS, UNIX, and ADA). First let's work up to
the solution with some observations:

First -

DDN hosts seem quite capable of receiving mail from, and mailing to, hosts on
other networks through a fairly extensive network of relay sites.  Although
there seem to be a variety of syntax variations, the following form (from the
DDN side) seems more or less universally understood:

	mail person%host.hisdomain@relayhost.mydomain

where "relayhost" has access to both "mydomain" and "hisdomain" networks.

 (e.g.) mail smith%umass.bitnet@wiscvm.arpa

I don't know the details of mail syntax from other networks to get the mail to
a relay site, but it obviously can be done, and if it gets to a relay addressed
to someone%somewhere.arpa, it will no doubt make it to it's DDN destination.
(This will undoubtedly be somewhat complicated soon, as there is a movement
afoot to have DDN hosts adopt more exotic domain names as opposed to just
plain ".arpa".  This will just blow off about half the mailers and mail
servers in the world for a few months until all the software gets modified to
handle the new domain syntax).

Second -

The "person" to whom mail is addressed may, in actuality, be an automaton
(e.g. a re-distribution list) as opposed to a real person who sifts through
mail.  Thus, properly formatted mail might easily be processed as input to
a computer program, the actions of which would be directed by the contents
of the mail.  A simple example of this would be a periodic batch demon
checking a user's mailbox every hour or so and sending out a canned reply
to the sender: SORRY, I AM OUT OF TOWN FOR TWO WEEKS - WILL REPLY 8/16/86.
Of course, the demon would have to have a few ounces of intelligence; for 
example, it would be most unkind to send such a reply to a distribution list
like INFO-CPM, for this would start an endless loop (don't laugh, it has
happened!).

Now, for the potential solution -

Instead of a non-DDN user posting an encoded form of his software to the entire
world, he would mail his encoded software (adhering to specific formatting
rules) to a DDN "server" mailbox.  If "uuencode" were used, perhaps it would
be best if this server were on a UNIX machine rather than TOPS-20, but other
encoders/decoders (e.g. public domain atob/btoa) could be used.  The server
would scan the sender's message, sense that it was a submission and properly
formatted, send an acknowledgement back to the sender, and queue the decoded
files for "ftp" transmission to SIMTEL20 archive administrators (the last step
would not be necessary if the "server" were SIMTEL20 itself).  When and if the
archive adminstrator put the software in the archives, he/she would notify the
original user by mail, who in turn could post a short note to the mailing list
abstracting the software and noting that it was now in the archives.

When a non-DDN user wished files or a directory from a particular archive,
he would again mail to the "server", this time formatted as a "software
request" rather than a submission.  The server would scan the sender's message,
sense that it was a software request, ftp the requested software from SIMTEL20,
encode it according to the rules, and mail it to the requestor.

When the "server" receives an ill-formatted message, notice to that effect is
simply returned to the sender.  A single server need not handle all the
SIMTEL20 archives, nor is it necessary for a single server to handle both
the submissions and the software requests for a single archive (i.e. sharing
the burden!).

But can it work? -

Now I'm not saying such an approach is without substantial technical risk or
complexity.  It obviously represents a potentially large increase in computing
resource burden to be absorbed by the administrator(s) of the server(s).  It
may also be administratively unacceptable to the DDN regulators or to the
regulators of the other networks.  It also may not work at all, for a variety
of technical reasons (e.g. mail messages on USENET are generally limited to
100000 bytes, so large files would have to be broken up).  By building a new
(and inefficient) File Transfer Protocol on top of the mail connections, it
probably borders on heresy!  Furthermore, interactions with "net.sources" and
other such special arrangements should be considered.  Finally, it represents
a lot of work to implement.

Nuff said - I'll ramble no further.  Perhaps this discussion should be moved
to INFO-NETS.

     The current AMPRO BIOS allows the reading of over 60 different disk

rather than the MFM format that most drives use. I'm not saying that it's
impossible, but I don't think it can be done.

I have a related experience that might help.  It seems that when I
tried to install the 60K version of Microsoft CP/M on my Apple ][ Plus,
BDS C would roll over and croak.  I was forced to go back to 56K CP/M.
I hypothesize that in 60K CP/M, Microsoft folds the CCP (and possibly
other parts of CP/M) into the alternative 4K memory bank on the
language card, and BDS C makes direct use of memory locations or
routines in the CCP.

Conclusion: you must somehow switch the CCP in and out of the normal
address space during compilation in such a way that BDS C can make use
of both the CCP and the CP/M system services (a difficult, perhaps
impossible task), or use a 56K version of CP/M.

WARNING:  PC Pursuit will not upload certain files!

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

As if the busy signals and disconnects were not enough (sigh),
listen to this...

Under certain circumstances, files may not be uploaded to a
remote system with Christensen ("XMODEM") protocol using the PC
Pursuit service of GTE Telenet.  In particular, the three-byte
ASCII sequence <CR, '@', CR> (binary <0DH, 40H, 0DH>) is ALWAYS
interpreted as an escape to Telenet command level.  If this
sequence occurs in an appropriate place within a file, that file
cannot be uploaded!  The typical effect with most file transfer
programs is the occurrence of repeated local timeout errors, and
an apparent loss of connection when the user returns to terminal
mode to attempt recovery after the transfer is aborted.

I have verified the above with Telenet customer service and
engineering representatives.  Their response was that this is an
unfortunate result of the established Telenet command structure,
and it is not likely that any attempt will be made to provide a
solution to this problem for PC Pursuit customers!  (Considering
the difficulty of making network connections at almost any hour
of the night, I'm sure there must be A LOT of us PC Pursuers out
there...  At $25 per month each, I had hoped we deserved a better
response than that.)

Note that this situation is unlikely to occur within an ASCII
text file produced on CP/M or MS-DOS systems, since CR is almost
always followed by LF in such files.  But it is certainly
possible within a binary (e.g. .COM) file.  (The high bit of each
byte is insignificant to Telenet, so there are actually eight
different 3-byte binary sequences which may cause this problem.) 
Also, there is a small likelihood of this occurring even during a
text file transfer, due to the binary record count and checksum
or CRC bytes which are generated by the protocol.  From my own
experience, the problem seems most likely to occur within
SQueezed files.

As a possible workaround to this problem, I would suggest trying
either of the following:

1.  Change the file compression.  I.e., (un)SQueeze or (un)CRUNCH
    the file, as appropriate to its original form.  Then leave a
    message to the remote system's SysOp requesting that the file
    be restored after it is received.

2.  If you are using XMODEM-CRC mode, try Checksum mode (or vice-
    versa).  If you are using 1K-byte (YMODEM) transfers, try
    using the slower 128-byte transfers instead.  Either of these
    changes may allow recovery from a small class of situations
    which could cause the problem.

The following facts should also be noted:

1.  This problem occurs only with uploads.  Downloads from a
    remote system are not affected.

2.  Once such a file transfer has been aborted, you have NOT lost
    your connection to the remote system!  Simply issue the
    command CONT (continue) at the Telenet @ prompt.

I hope this information will save others the hours of aggravation
it has caused me.

Subject: Re:   Bondwell CP/M computers

Yes, I owned a model 12 for a month or so before I picked up my Kaypro. I must
say it was an excellant machine. The thing is essentially a Kaypro 4-84, with
a 4 meg clock, two drives, and a 9" amber monitor. In addition you get
function keys, an external monitor output, and (in my case) WordStar,
DataStar, CalcStar, and a couple other Star's with complete documentation,
i.e. copies of Micro Pro's complete manuals. The cabinet design is far
superior to the Kaypro's. It is made of a thick plastic, with all the controls
(power, contrast, reset) on the front next to the monitor. The cord stores in a
compartment on the back, which, when closed, protects all the plugs, (monitor
output, 2 RS-232, 1 serial, power input). The only reason I didn't keep it was
that I needed double sided drives, which your $399 model probably doesn't have.
(although they *are* manufactured with DSDD drives, for what would have cost me
$400 more). It also comes with a program that allows it to read and write to
Kaypro II, Osbourne, and some other strange make disks, although it cannot
format Kaypro, etc.

I would avoid the model 14, which uses CP/M 3.0 like the Commodore 128. Not
that there's anything wrong with 3.0, it's just that there evidently isn't a
whole lot of machines that use it.

BTW, Kaypro is selling model 1's again for $595! You may want to look into one
of those. You can buy them directly from the factory at that price.

I would like to obtain the following reference information for the PCPI
Applicard Z-80 processor and the accompanying CP/M implementation.
I think that Personal Computer Products Inc. was purchased by Micropro or
went out of business.  

I know some people know this (employees of Empathy Software, former
PCPI employees), and there must be somewhere to write to obtain
at least some hardware reference information.  

Now it gets boring:

	Apple View of Applicard:
		- use of standard slot-dependent addresses for scratch
		  RAM, ROM, and interprocessor communication
		- interrupt daisy chain handling
		- dma daisy chain handling
		- location, size, and entry points of 6502 monitor
		- boot sequence 
	Applicard view of itself and the Apple
		- RAM and ROM addressing/bank switching
		- i/o space resources
		- ports used to interface to 6502
		- boot sequence
		- writing and installing device drivers
	Hardware
		- schematics
		- meaning of the 2x4 and the 2x25 jumpers or expansion
		  connectors

I have done various CP/M OEM ports, written drivers, spoolers, etc. and
am very familiar with all the insides of the Microsoft Softcard implementation.

I know I can figure all this out again by disassembling lotsa code.
And I can figure out the hardware by tracing the etch of
both sides of the board and reverse-engineering the schematics.  This is
just an extremely tedious process.

I would be willing to pay a modest amount, e.g. under $20 for significant
portions of the information mentioned.  I have no commercial interest in
any of this.  I am merely exploring this implementation.
		
Thank you kindly for your interest if you have read this far.  Any assistance
will be appreciated.

I have heard that MIX C is slow, and has a *huge* run-time package.

I've been using BDS C, which works pretty well, but the i/o is non-standard.
It has a few other shortcomings, some of which have been quite irritating,
but all-in-all, it works.

I've a friend who's been using Ecosoft C (for Z80), and rates it quite highly.
It's not cheap, but it's apparently pretty good.

I've used the MIX C compiler under CP/M and find it to be OK for
light and ocassional use.  I wouldn't recommend it for a developer.

It does not compile to assembler, but rather to psuedo-code.  It
creates somewhat large programs, since the the run-time support
must be included (or exist on the system separately)  It doesn't
compare in speed, since it runs sort of like it was an interpreter.
It is complete, with some nice enhancements. The tutorial/manual
is pretty good.  There is a version of MIX C available for the PC.

Since you mentioned the PC, I have just bought a Turbo clone, and
got a copy of ECO-C88 from ECOSOFT for $59.  This is a pretty nice
package, at least for my needs.  It does limit you to a small
memory model, though.(64k)  The manual is adequate, but not great.
The compiler is quite good -- fairly fast and complete.  You must
use the IBM Linker (no problem for me since I'm using PC-DOS).
The only problem I've found is that it is a little difficult to use
on a 'floppy-only' machine.  The size of the libraries means swapping
disks alot.  Since I've gotten my 10 megger, though, it simplified
things greatly. I'm quite happy with this package.
I DO think that I would buy something else if I was in business
writing C programs. (just in case I needed a larger memory model)

I hope this information is helpful.

No, PCPI did not go out of business.  The last I heard, they were phasing
out on Apple stuff and concentrating on the IBM market.  The PCPI card
alone contains 64k of onboard memory.  The 2x5 and 2x25 expansion pins
are used to piggy-back another memory module onto the Appli-Card.  Each
memory module can contain up to 128k of memory.  Only two modules max
may be added, though.  This gives you a RAM disk with a 222k workspace,
-2k for the directory, and - 32k for software management.
 
PCPI offers an OEM package for about $50 that gives the technical info you
need.  Also included are two disks which contains sample drivers, a 6502
cross assembler and loader.  You might want to contact them to see if this
package is still offered.

Just a short note on your
PCPI query - perhaps more
will follow very soon.

PCPI is still alive and
well, although the PCPI
Applicard is no longer
marketed.  They do still
support the card, however,
and do a nice job of it.

Much of the info you
desire is in the OEM
support package with
that is
available from PCPI.
It includes sample drivers
for all device classes,
a 6502 assembler that
runs under the Z80, and
other software information.

The OEM package was about
$35 or $40.

There is very little about
the PCPI hardware in
print.  The best sources
of this are calling PCPI
technical support directly
or Laing Electronics (or
the Laing BBS).  The PCPI
technical people (make
sure you ask for tech
support) were very nice
about answering all of
my questions, and in
as much detail as I cared
to pursue on the hardware
side of things.  Don't
press on the software,
buy the OEM package.  There
are people on this list
who have had a fair amount
of experience with both.

I'm trying to use MailMerge to assemble letters containing multiple lines of 
information extracted from multiple data files, without success.

I have two data files, one containing a list of people who are to be included
in a seminar, and the other containing a list of the people who will moderate
the seminar (actually three or four different seminar groupings, all to run
concurrently).  I need to generate two sets of letters: 

1.  Extract a data record from list 1 to be the addressing information, and a
    data record from list 2 to tell the addressee when and where the seminar
    is to be, and by whom it will be moderated.  (For a seminar with three
    groups, this set will contain between 15 and 18 letters.)

2.  Extract a data record from list 2 to be the addressing information, and 
    six selected records from list 1, to tell the addressed moderator the
    names, etc., of the people who will be in his or her group.  (For a 
    seminar with three groups, this set will contain three letters.)

Am I trying to do the impossible?

Is there really no way to disable the escape sequence with Telenet?
Foreign data networks (about which I know more) all provide for this, with
standard international paramater no. 1 for PAD (packet assembler and
disassembler) protocols, according to a CCITT standard.  When paramater
no. 1 is set to 0, you cannot escape to net command level in that session
and so can upload binary files.

Subject:  posting software to the net

I would like to encourage some kind of posting of software in addition
to the archives at SIMTEL20. As one the the low-class non-DDN people, I
feel the frustration that has been expressed by others when I see glowing
descriptions of some new public-domain software that sounds useful only
to find out that the only way to get it is thru FTP on ARPANET. Ther are
some excellent nearby RCP/M bulletin board systems that I use, but not all
the stuff I want shows up there.

WE do have to be careful about this, however. From my perspective, the
phone charges are insignificant, but other restrictions would prohibit
indiscriminant whole-sale mailing of software. I do have mass storage
limitations that could easily be exceded if tons of software poured in
while I was away on vacation. Since our local CSNET software is the
store-and-forward variety, it would interprete disk quota problems as
an incomplete delivery and re-try every hour, generating MANY error
messages to the system administrator along the way. You can imagine
that this might cause unfriendly feelings. Other people do have
problems with the telephone charges, and would not want to get large
volumes of unwanted software.

AT the same time, I am greatly in favor of distributing source code.
I have no sympathy for the argument that says "please send executables
only since I have only a BASIC interpreter." I have a least one compiler
for all the major languages (C, PASCAL, FORTRAN, BASIC) as well as
several assemblers and interpreters. Of course my BDS-C compiler is
would force me to modify code intended for MIX-C or C-80 or XYZ-C
compilers, but that's the way it goes. AT least I have a chance to
do so. If I get executable or object code, there is no reasonable
way for me to modify it for the particulars of my machine. Besides,
I like to look at the source code to get ideas and learn new techniques.
I believe that most CP/M enthusiasts (as opposed to users) would agree.

My idea of the optimum situation would be one in which announcements
of new software would be distributed thru INFO-CPM and have the source
code accessable somewhere via a mail request. The when I see something
interesting, I could send off a mail message asking to have the source
code mailed to me. I don't think it is reasonable to expect the originator
of the software to do this. Often it is quite dificult to figure out
mail return addresses that come from some other net, even given the
mail header info and what the person thinks is his return address. I know
that I would be less than excited about mailing out hundreds of messages
to unknown people if I had to spend a number of minutes deciphering
addresses and dealing with an uncooperative mail system. The ideal system
would be to have an mail server installed in a central site that
would accept requests for source code and automatically send the request
source via return mail. I think that the major impediment is getting
software to implement such a server - or does this kind of thing already
exist somewhere?

Second best would be having a seperate mailing list (maybe info-cpm-sources)
send out to a subset of the INFO-CPM mail list. Individuals would have to
request to be on the source mailing list. We would get some software
that we weren't interested in, but people who don't want it at all would
not be bothered by it.

I guess all this verbage boils down to:

        1) distribute source code, not object code

        2) have a seperate, parallel mail list for the sources

        3) myabe try to develope an automatic server

SUBJECT:  PC Pursuit file upload problem solved!

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

My previous warning message (PCP-WARN.MSG) reported the inability 
of GTE Telenet's PC Pursuit service to upload certain files using 
Christensen ("XMODEM") protocol.  In particular, files containing 
the three-byte ASCII sequence <CR, '@', CR> (binary <0DH, 40H, 
0DH>) cannot normally be uploaded, since this sequence (and any 
variation with high bits set in any of the three bytes) causes an 
escape to Telenet command level.

In response to my initial inquiry about this problem, Telenet 
customer service and engineering representatives informed me that 
no solution was likely.  I am now pleased to report that this 
information was incorrect!  It is possible to upload files 
containing the three-byte Telenet escape sequence by following 
the procedure described below.

After connecting to the remote modem (C DIALxxx/xx command), 
escape to Telenet command level by typing (cr) @ (cr).  Then 
issue the following two commands at the Telenet @ prompts (where 
(cr) indicates RETURN or ENTER as appropriate to your keyboard):

        @SET? 1:0 (cr)
        PAR1:0

        @CONT (cr)

The SET? (Set Parameter) command disables subsequent recognition 
of the normal Telenet escape sequence.  (The PAR1:0 message is a 
response from Telenet.)  The CONT (Continue) command then returns 
control to the remote modem.  Note that the above commands may be 
entered at any time after connecting to the remote dialing area 
via the Telenet C (Connect) command (i.e., before or after 
issuing a Hayes modem ATDT dialing command to connect to a remote 
system).  However, these commands should be used with caution...
Once they have been entered, there is no way to escape back to 
Telenet command level in order to issue a D (Disconnect) command! 
I.e., connection to another dialing area can only be made by 
hanging up (dropping carrier) and then re-dialing into your local 
Telenet access node.

My thanks to Telenet Director of Marketing, Kevin Abt (the 
"Father of PC Pursuit") for researching this problem and 
providing the above information.  Kevin also reports that GTE is 
actively responding to the enormous popularity of PC Pursuit by 
expanding capacity and enhancing the system.  They have just 
completed a several-week effort to increase the number of 
outgoing modems in each of the 14 metropolitan areas currently 
served by PC Pursuit.  (I have personally noticed a marked 
improvement in the time required to obtain network connections.)  
They are now in the process of testing 2400 bps service and new 
modems which provide enhanced call progress reporting, for 
deployment in all PC Pursuit cities.  They are also soliciting 
requests for additional cities for future service.  To keep 
abreast of the latest developments and/or to provide feedback to 
Kevin, call the NET-EXCHANGE, a FIDO BBS in the Washington, DC 
(DIAL202) area at (703)-689-3561.

I'm trying to use MailMerge to assemble letters containing multiple lines of 
information extracted from multiple data files, without success.

I have two data files, one containing a list of people who are to be included
in a seminar, and the other containing a list of the people who will moderate
the seminar (actually three or four different seminar groupings, all to run
concurrently).  I need to generate two sets of letters: 

1.  Extract a data record from list 1 to be the addressing information, and a
    data record from list 2 to tell the addressee when and where the seminar
    is to be, and by whom it will be moderated.  (For a seminar with three
    groups, this set will contain between 15 and 18 letters.)

2.  Extract a data record from list 2 to be the addressing information, and 
    six selected records from list 1, to tell the addressed moderator the
    names, etc., of the people who will be in his or her group.  (For a 
    seminar with three groups, this set will contain three letters.)

Am I trying to do the impossible?

Thanks for any help,

As far as I know, Commodore is has no plans to publish the diagrams.  The RAM
expansion modules consist simply of either 64K x1 or 256K x1 DRAMs and the
8726 (custom) controller.  The controller itself eliminates the need for TTL
address and data buffering.  The controller also provides DRAM refresh.
The C128 (or C64) processor accesses the expansion RAM via instructions to the
controller, which then reads/writes/swaps memory via DMA.  The controller
drives the bus only during phase 2 of the standard 1MHz system clock.

[sacrafice for the line-eater]

It has been my *very* limited experience with a Bondwell 14 running
CP/M 3.0 that I have had no trouble running CP/M 2.2 programs.  The
14 is supposed to be Kaypro II compatable, and we have had no trouble
running the programs (few they may be) that we bought for it.  This
includes Turbo Pascal, and a couple of communications progams (neither
of which meet our needs).

We have had problems with CP/M 2.2 systems reading our CP/M 3.0 disks.
What we have had to do in those cases is find a mutual read/write format
and have the other machine format a disk to use. We now keep a few disks
around that are in a different format to be used for tansfers.

I am interested in any info about the compatability of CP/M 3.0 and 2.2
programs.  Thanks in advance.

You NEED to buy L. David Stone's book called (something like) "Things
MicroPro Never Told You About WordStar, MailMerge & StarIndex".  The
book is loaded with fairly well documented features that MicroPro
doesn't cover in the manual and with lots of great "tricks" on how to
get your hardware to do (WordStar) things you might otherwise never
dream up yourself.  It sells for between $15 and $20; I don't remember
the exact price; and has a black cover with the title in white and green
printed diagonally across it.

Good Luck

It now appears that the "best" solution to the problem of
non-Internet access to the files in the SIMTEL20 archives
is to develop a program that will take specifically formatted
mail requests for files, ARC and uuencode the file, and send
the result back to the requestor if the file is under a certain
ceiling.  The alternate suggestion of a "net.sources.cpm" could
still be independently persued, but only one address per site.

The pieces of the mail server technique are falling together.
I currently have a TOPS-20 version of ARC about 95% complete.
A TOPS-20 version of uuencode will be revisited shortly.  The
server to envelope these pieces appears to be "easy" (famous
last words).  Let me see what can be done, and I'll report
back to you all when I come up for air...

[munch]

	As a Usenet site with no connections to the ARPA net I have
been drooling over some of the teasers we've gotten in the form of
SIMTEL20 lists.  I requested info from the net regarding existence
of a CP/M BBS in the Maryland area and got no responses.  So I vote
for posting to the net.  However...as a site that pays our own phone
bills from contracts and grants I would like to see it be a moderated
group (say mod.source.cpm) with some reasonable form of archiving.
That might prevent the usual 'I didn't get whizbang...could someone
repost it?'  Perhaps a list of what's available could be kept and
mail to the list maintainer would bounce the list back.  Then
requests for something archived could be mailed to the moderator.
I bet if we thought about it for a bit we could come up with a decent
method of automatically mailing out the requested software.

	So there's my two cents worth.  Not having connections
to the other nets I can't respond to the other concerns that were
raised.  My only concern is that we not raise the ire of the net
any more than it already is due to increased volume (see what's
been happening in net.adm etc).

	I'm glad to see that CP/M lives!

(PLEASE EXCUSE THE ALL-CAPS)

I THINK THAT THE IDEA OF A SERVER GETTING MAIL COMMANDS
AND SENDING FILES IS AN *EXCELLENT* IDEA.  HOWEVER, SINCE
NOT ALL NETWORK USERS ARE USING TOPS-20, I THINK THAT FILES
SHOULD BE ABLE TO BE SENT IN OTHER FORMATS, SUCH AS .hex
FILES. FOR EXAMPLE, THERE COULD BE COMMANDS LIKE:


HEX NULU151.COM       -WOULD SEND NULU151.COM IN HEX FORMAT, TO
                       BE LOAD'ED OR HEXCOM'D.

UUE NULU151.COM       -WOULD SEND NULU151.COM IN A UUENCODED
                       FORMAT.

THERE COULD ALSO BE A DIR COMMAND, WHICH, BY ITSELF, WOULD
SEND A LIST OF THE FILE AREAS AVAILABLE, AND WITH A PARAMETER
OF A FILE AREA WOULD SEND A LIST OF THE FILES IN THAT AREA.
I THINK THAT THIS WOULD BE AN EXCELLENT SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEM
OF ACCCESS TO THE SIMTEL20 ARCHIVES BY BITNET, JANET, CSNET,
ETC.

Matt,

It's not that anybody is running under TOPS-20.  It's just that
TOPS-20 is the operating system used by SIMTEL20.  I feel that the
basic requirement to have ARC and uudecode available on the target
operating system is not too much to ask.  ARC is already native to
MSDOS users, and I believe there is a version of uudecode also
available.  On the CP/M side, there are several variants of at least
the extract portion of ARC available, and I believe uudecode is
available as well.

The reason for choosing these two in combination is that the resulting
message is pretty well guaranteed to be both shorter than the original
and transmittable as an ordinary text mail file.  It's not a parsing
problem; it's simply an arbitrary policy decision, for now, at least.
Let me see how things go and maybe there might be an option made
available to allow retrieval of certain key bootstrap files only in
HEX form.

Subject: Mail access to the SIMTEL20 archives

I am a Europian BITNET-user and I am in deed a little bit frustrated when
I hear of all the software on SIMTEL20. I only want to make one (new?) point.
If sources are distributed with a new mailing list it is still impossible
to get old, but certainly good, software from SIMTEL20. The solution with
an automatic fileserver sounds much more attractive to my ears.

Now the question arises: do we really have to develop our own software?
There are some other fileservers on the ARPA-net that also work together
with BITNET. For example:

    INFO@CSNET-SH.ARPA
You can get more informations with:
    Request:Info
    Topic: Help

and:
     NETLIB@ANL-MCS.ARPA
To receive information mail the following command to NETLIB:

Send index

These are automatic fileservers, as far as I know. Does anyone know,
whether it is possible to use their software?

Descriptions:

C128TVX2.LBR -

This is a version of the TVX video-oriented editor configured for the
Commodore 128 running CP/M 3.0.  Executable .COM file, source code and
manual are included.  The program would be usable as-is on other CP/M
systems which support ADM-31 terminal control sequences, but would
have to be recompiled to support other terminals.  In this version,
text buffer sizing is automatic as a function of available TPA, so it
will work with RSXs active (unlike a previous version, TVX-C128).  The
name of the LBR has been changed to allow a version number to be included
to avoid confusion with the older version.

C8FILCPY.LBR -

This is specifically designed for allowing a Commodore 128 user
with a single drive (yes, they do exist) to copy CP/M files without
unnecessary disk swapping.  This program, unlike PIP or SWEEP, buffers
several files between disk swaps, in an effort to mimimize disk swaps.
It uses virtual drive E:.  Source and .COM file included.

C1571-2.COM -

This version, dated 24-Feb-86, is a replacement for C1571.COM.  It
is a disk write speedup utility for the Commodore 1571 disk drive
running with CP/M 3.0 on a C128.  The original one uploaded is an
early Commodore release which has two bugs: MFM operation of the
drive is damaged, and the drive motor refuses to shut off after a
write.  This version fixes those bugs.  Commodore says it's ok to
distribute this, and seeks wide availability.

Additional info on PD:<CPM.C128> files C128TVX2.LBR and C8FILCPY.LBR:

The .COM files were compiled with Z-80 op-codes and may not work without
recompilation on 8080 based systems (are there really such things still
existing?).  This does not affect C128 owners, as this is a Z80 machine.

The FILECOPY program does not support "cross-user" copies (whereas PIP,
and perhaps SWEEP do).

Subject:  bulk file transfers via xmodem

	
	Fellow netlanders:

		Being fully aware of the xmodem programs available from
	SIMTEL20, and using them to download software from our BSD4.2 vax
	to my micro....I was wondering if anyone knew of a version of
	xmodem that supports bulk transfers via wildcards and the like.

		I know that 'mget' in ftp allows bulk transfers from
	SIMTEL20 to my local vax system, and my version of MDM730 also
	supports bulk transfers....but the version of xmodem only 
	supports single file transfers.

		If anyone out there knows of a version of xmodem that
	does support bulk transfers, I'd surely be interested in hearing
	from him/her. It sure would make life a little easier.

I realize that you weren't really trying to suggest that we ignore 8080-based
systems, Frank.

But I thought I would point out that there is actually a GROWING number
of non-Z80 CP/M systems around. Namely those that use the NEC V-20 chip
in an IBM-PC/clone environment.  The V-20 unfortunately doesn't do the
Z-80 opcodes, but it is a GREAT 8080.  I am currently doing all my 8080
and Z80 development work using the 8-bit M80/L80 from a retired CP/M
machine. The V-20 is much faster and it allows me to mix more modern
tools like MAKE and a better editor with the venerable assembler/linker
and some others that I retain from the Z-80 machine. Unfortunately, there
are a few such tools, to which I do not have the source, that won't run
because of the Z-80 opcodes in them.

Subject: Any TurboDOS Users out there?
To: info-cpm@AMSAA.ARPA, turbodos-users@BRL-SEM.ARPA
Cc: towson@BRL.ARPA, rbloom@APG-1.ARPA

I am a new user of TurboDOS, the multi-processor and multi-user 
operating system.  I am not yet on the plateau of my learning 
curve from the supplied documentation, but am rapidly approaching 
it.  The machine in question is a NorthStar Horizon running 8 
TurboSlaves, 2 HD18's, 2 printers and some commo ports.  It's 
currently running TurboDOS version 1.3 (N* v1.1.1).  (NorthStar 
never released a 1.4 version.)

Is there any TurboDOS users out there that can aid me in some 
slightly past initial type questions?  (in order of priority:)

     . WordStar does not properly close files when they're saved, 
they're truly closed only when WS is exited.  A second person in 
a file previously opened but not properly closed is not allowed 
to make changes and save them.  (And how I have the COMPAT flag 
set, you don't even get an error!)  So, is there a patch so WS 
*will* correctly close a file that is saved with the common ^K^D?

     . MXO-TD30 is the MEX overlay for TurboDOS using the printer 
port on the user processor.  It works fine for my dial-up Modem.  
However, it can't send a <break> on my Earth TurboSlave card.  Of 
course, that what I need to do.  Before I try to tackle the 
hardware specifics in the overlay, has anyone already solved it?

     . MEX-TDOS is the mex overlay for TurboDOS to use a port off 
of the master processor and involves defining a new user (t-41) 
call for better response.  Also of course, it's very hardware 
specific (written for a JCS s-100 computer.)  Likewise, before I 
tackle this one, has anyone done an overlay for the NorthStar 
Horizon HSIO/4?

     . d/Multi is a dBase II enhancement that turns it into a 
true multi-user DBMS with the record and files locks of TurboDOS.  
Anybody use it?  It is any good?  Is there something better?

     . With the potentially huge (well, relivitively huge) 'BIOS' 
memory space availability with banked slaves, has any one written 
QuickKey or similar function key enhancements?  After 5 years 
with a TeleVideo terminal, I *still* haven't found any use for 
the unredefinable 'function' keys!  The enhancements I have found 
and are working on are fanled and timecl.

     . So far I know of only one book about/for TurboDOS 
("TurboDOS made easy," by Steven Marks) other than the two 
binders that came with my NorthStar version 1.3.  (The upgrade to 
Version 1.4 is on order.)  Are there any other books on the 
subject?  (An example: the use of the AUTOLOAD command to create 
command line synonyms [or ZCPR3 aliases] is not mentioned at all 
and is probably more usefull have the functions that are listed!)  
Sure it's fun to figure these things out yourself, but I wonder 
what I'm missing.  (mini-review: The Marks book is not bad, adds 
sections on why one would want to do things to the information 
that already is in the user's guide, written in a plain language.  
Unfortunated marred by some bad typos, some which are opposite of 
what was wanted.  An example: 'set filename.ext ;-r' sets the r/o 
flag *ON*.)


Any of the above need not be public domain and/or 'free', though 
it sure does make procurement easier!  As the system in question 
belongs to Uncle Sam, some funds should be available somewhere :-)

Version 11.7 of the W0RLI MailBox/Gateway has been released and is now
available from SIMTEL20 as:

Filename			Type	 Bytes	 CRC

Directory PD:<CPM.PACKET>
PACKT117.ARC.1			BINARY	212704  0B69H

This release is being distributed in ARC format because of the more
efficient packing methods available.  You can extract the files on
your CP/M system using one of the following:

Directory PD:<CPM.STARTER-KIT>
UNARC.COM-Z80.1			BINARY	  4096  C209H <--Z80 version
UNARCA.COM-8080.1		BINARY	  4736  DF9BH <--8080 version

The changes since the last such posting, version 11.2, are summarized
below in an extract from the CHANGES.TNC file.

For those who have not seen this system before, a brief description:

The W0RLI MailBox and GateWay is a system which runs on a Xerox 820
computer and which operates on Amateur Packet Radio via one or two
TAPR TNCs (or clones). It also runs with TNC-2s.

The W0RLI system is running at over 75 sites in some number of
countries and makes up the majority of the packet mail forwarding
system. It is also used for gatewaying between local packet areas and
long haul links on HF, or to nearby nets on other VHF/UHF bands.
For a more complete description, see NOTES.TNC.

Hank is not on ARPANET or Usenet.  I will be glad to relay comments
and questions to him.  However, he is also in the process of moving
from W1-land to W6-land, so contact is not as solid as it has been.
Also, he won't be doing much coding on this system for a while,
for the same reason.

If you would prefer to get this distribution on ready-to-run
disks for your Xerox 820, send a self-addressed stamped 8" SSSD
disk (in re-usable mailer) to K7PYK at the address below. Two
disks if you want the sources as well.

I will do the same under the same conditions.  I am good in the
Callbook.

NOTE -  Hank is no longer doing distributions himself.  Wes, K7PYK,
has kindly volunteered to take over that job.  Please do NOT send
disks to Hank.

A version of UUENCODE/UUDECODE for CP/M was recently posted to
Info-Cpm.  However, the UUENCODE program has a bug that adds one
additional record to the UUENCODEd file and when you UUDECODE it the
CRCs won't match.  I'm hoping the author will send me a fixed version
which I can then make available on SIMTEL20 and through other means.

Has anyone built a version of David Betz' XLISP for CP/M-80 since v1.2 ?
If so, what compiler did you use (anybody tried Small-C ?), and/or where
did you download it from ?

Did the INFO-XLISP list ever get started ?

I must lend my support to the view of Willie Smith, as I too deposited the MIX 
editor into my lower left hand drawer.  My syste uses interrupts and the 
crashes are not random.  I cannot even run the configuration program.  I did 
disable interrupts with a special BIOS and configured MIX.  What I found was a 
powerful but incredibly slow editor.  Every operation seemed to require an 
overlay to be loaded from disk.  Furthermore only 8K bytes are available to 
edit anything.  I use Magic Wand and have over 40K bytes resident with all 
commands resident also.  I could not take the performance hit of using MIX in 
spite of its features (assuming that I could get it to run with interrupts).  I
am interested in the Stack Fix.   Late in responding as I was in AUstralia for 
a month.

Subject: Bug in CP/M UUENCODE fixed

Several weeks ago UUENCODE and UUDECODE, written in Turbo Pascal for
use on CP/M, were posted to Info-Cpm (net.micro.cpm).  A bug in
UUENCODE caused one additional "garbage" record to be included at the
end of the file.  This caused the resultant UUDECODEd file to be one
record longer than the original file and prevented error checking with
CRCK.  The fixed area is shown below (thanks to Bernie Eiben):

  procedure encode1;

    begin {encode1};
      if numbytes = bytesperhunk then flushhunk;
      endofinfile := not (getbyte(hunk[numbytes]));
      if not endofinfile then numbytes := succ(numbytes)  {No succ at EOF -BE}
    end; {encode1}

I do hope we don't end up using uuencode/uudecode when other means are
available for doing file transfers.  We CP/M'ers have maintained a
relatively error-free environment over the years.  The
Uuencode/Uudecode system contains NO CRC or CHECKSUM error checking!
If we were to add that, the programs would no longer be compatible
with Unix versions.  I suggest that anyone sending files using this
program include a CRC list in the introduction so readers can check
the decoded files with my CRCK program.  CRCK, by the way, is also
available for Unix.  It's in PD:<UNIX.CPM>CRCK2.C here at SIMTEL20.

	Depends on what you concider cheap.  Ecosoft C is $49.95.  I like it
alot, but it's HUGE.  I've used bother BDS and Ecosoft, BDS is very fast, and
comes with alot of goodies, but is terribly non-K&R.  Ecosoft is standard,
cheap, and has a good library, but it's slow and the modules have to be very
small to compile under it.

Epson's PX-8 is a CP/M laptop.  There are a few stores that still sell
them...in fact, Epson supports them fairly well.  They go up to ~32K I
believe, and come with a word-processor (ski-writer).  3.5" drives
are amoung the accessories available.

Subject: possible bug in CP/M 3.0 "PIP"

CP/M 3.0 supports the character "_" (underline) as valid within a filename and
it is so documented.  Builtins such as ERASE and RENAME have no trouble
handling this, nor does either the builtin or transient DIR.  However, PIP just
gets bent out of shape and refuses to accept the syntax (e.g. a:=b:tvx_io.c).
I am referring specifically to the Commodore 128 version of 3.0, but suspect it
is really a generic problem.  Digital Research sent me their set of application
notes, but I didn't see this mentioned as a fixed bug.  I don't suppose there is
any easy fix short of re-writing PIP?

Recently I called PCPI ((619)485-8411) and got lots of their BIOS info just
by talking to one of their tech support people.  They are very helpful.
Their implementation of CP/M is much more elegant and customizable than that
of Microsoft.  I know they're not out of business unless they are advertising
their new laser printer in PC Week for masochistic purposes only.

I'm looking for CP/M 3.0 or ZCPR3 for the Applicard.  Does anyone know if
they are available?

The 'work around' that I use to make bulk downloads from my unix
machine to my micro is to use MEX in the 'read' mode.  Goes something
like this:
	1. use mget for the simtel20 batch
	  2. copy a directory listing down to the micro
	3. while holding the line open, drop to a text editor on
the micro.
		delete the junk at the start and end of the file with
			the directory in it
		change all lines from 'filename' to 
			'sendout "umodem -sbl filename";r filename
		save it
	4. go back into mex and give the command 'read filelist' where
filelist has the modified file directory
	5. watch it go
Lots of capability with a read file - once I downloaded 50 files with
one command.

It appears the the recent update of the TAC software to #113 increased
the input buffers enough to suuport XMODEM protocol (yeh, I know it's
MODEM protocol).  I've been able to upload to SIMTEL20 from TACs that
previously didn't work for that.  If you've been using KERMIT because
your buffer was too small, give TMODEM a try now and see if it works
for uploading.

The Epson Geneva (PX-8) definitely is a CP/M machine.  The Starlet (I am
pretty sure) and the SORD can operate as CP/M machines, but have
additional (and default) operating modes that are intended to be
'simple' and that don't look like CP/M.  The PX-8 moves beyond/above
CP/M only in having a menu-selection mode for commands that is easily
shut off.

Incidentally, these three machines are really laptops, with weights in
the 4-5 pound range.  The Bondwell, as I understand it, requires a
somewhat stronger lap.

If anyone cares, I have no affiliation with any of the four companies,
and this should not be construed as a recommendation for or against of
the machines, although I do have a much-travelled and much-abused Epson.

There is at least on BB near/in Baltimore that supports CPM, MSDOS & PCDOS.
That is at the Heath Electronic Center.  The BB telephone number is
301-661-2175, the board operates 24 hours a day, with the hours of 6-8am
being reserved for the SYSOPS.  There is no charge, and several of the
users have MILNET (SIMTEL20) access.  The board is closed, you can call in
at 300, 1200 & 2400 baud and get the info for obtaining access - put your
printer on.  The BB is not as busy as on might expect and there is a one
hour limitation unless you are uploading.

reference to an article or book that describes ZCPR - preferably one that is
available outside of the USA?  I seem to recall mention of a book in this
newsgroup some time ago.   Also, frequently there is mention in this
newsgroup of ZSYS software:  is this the same thing, or related?  And how
can someone at my side of the pond obtain this software?  Please mail
responses, and I'll post a summary if it looks to be interesting to others.

Many thanks to those who assisted me with getting UUENCODE and 
UUDECODE up, in the interests of paying it forward:
	Anyone who needs a HEX version of the latest UUENCODE and
UUDECODE (load with LOAD/DDT/DEHEXIFY/etc) for CP/M, pelase write
me and I will send you the files.
 
Hmm, it would appear that the MIX editor is really touchy about
stack space, if it can't run with interrupts.  My hack was fairly
simple, I used a debugger (ZDT) to disassemble the program at
0100H and followed the logic as best as I could.  One of the first
things the program does is to set up the stack pointer to a known
value.  I patched this location to set up the stack pointer to FFFFH
(where there is some free room in my BIOS), and the program appeared
to work better (the continual crashes went away).  When I explained
this to the guy at MIX, he said it couldn't be the stack, as the 
program used 4K (not a typo, four kilobytes) of stack space.  As it
didn't use that much in that blank space at the end of my bios, I
assumed it set up one stack for the init routines and then another
for the actual execution.  [Special NOTE: the stack builds _down_
from the top, if you do this, point at the _highest_ adress in the
stack space when you say  LD  SP,SPACE].  Even after fixing that
major problem, though, I don't know if it's worth it....

I would appreciate information from anyone who has used/uses DateStamper.
What restrictions does it place on the host system?  I have modified

A friend was just complaining about the lack of support
for dial code prefixes with MEX.  He'd like to be able
to make calls via Sprint and only have to tell MEX about
his access code, etc., only once.

I haven't used MEX in quite some time, but I thought it
had that capability.

Could someone who knows please mail me a description of
how to use that feature (if it exists).

Thanks very much.

Re:   Uuencode/uudecode character transparency over the net

I did some experimenting with the character translation that takes place
when one crosses a BITNET/ARPANET gateway.  Many characters were filtered
during the EBCDIC <==> ASCII conversions, particularly by the UCBJADE
gateway.  However, it appears that ALL of the characters used by the
uuencode/uudecode programs have unique representations on both sides
of the WISCVM gateway.  Also, the translation performed at WISCVM
seems to agree exactly with the translation VM on IBM hosts uses when
communicating with ASCII terminals.  (I do not know if the same
statement can be made for MVS hosts and the non-IBM BITNET machines.)

At any rate, at least for VM BITNET sites, ARPANET to BITNET via the
normal WISCVM path, then to CP/M via something suitable like KERMIT
should yield the desired results.

(**Note**:  The EBCDIC values used for brackets, braces, backslash,
etc, are not same values needed for a TN-train printer.  So, though
clear-text files may look funny when displayed on an IBM printer or
327X terminal, they should still arrive in CP/M-land correctly :-)

Header-Disclaimer: I don't like my headers either !
X-VMS-Mail-To: CPM

I am running MEX 1.14 on my Apple (kudos Nightowl !).  Anyway, either
with or without the Smartmodem overlay, I can't seem to enter a '*'
as part of the number... it's an invalid number if I do.  The MEX doc
says that it doesn't stop you from entering what you want, but I of
course have the source for the overlays I', using and it doesn't do it !
(Sticking to the typical ATDT 1-615-etc. works fine.)  I want to do an
'ATDT *70,' to disable my call-waiting.  Grumble.

Does anybody dial a '*' into their MEX ?  Thanks !

I am also one of those people who does not have access to SIMTEL20 through

SIMTEL20 software?

We do have a BITNET connection at this site, and I can request that files be
loaded to it if anyone can give me the appropriate instructions on how to do
this.  (Our administrators are considering installing a software package to
allow the server style of transfer - if anyone has information on available

   Below is a copy of an earlier message from Keith Petersen about P2DOS. 
This DOS (version 2.1 at least) has many attractive features.  You have the
full source, so you can tailor it as you wish.  It supports time/date
stamping of files in a CP/M3-compatible way.  It has a search path, like
that of ZCPR, but unlike the latter is useful when a running program looks
for other files, such as overlays, swap files, libraries, and so on.  One of
the troublesome limitations of ZCPR is that it can find the main COM file,
such as WS.COM, along the search path, but then when WS looks for its
overlays, it can't find them and the program grinds to a halt.  There are,
of course, other solutions to this problem.  P2DOS now also supports the
archive bit so that modified files can be identified.  The one feature that
ZRDOS has that P2DOS currently lacks is the ability to automatically log in
new disks.

Message-ID: <SAGE.23450894@LL.ARPA>

   Below is a description of DateStamper that appeared earlier on the net by
one of its authors, Bridger Mitchell.  I would add the following comments.
 
   The original version poked changes into the BDOS and might have failed to
work with a modified BDOS.  However, the current release includes a version
that will work with any kind of CP/M2.2-compatible BDOS, such as ZRDOS or,
presumably, P2DOS.
 
   There are two ways to install DateStamper.  The easy way is as an RSX
(resident system extension) below the CCP.  In that case you are right that
it takes up quite a bit of TPA (2K for the CCP plus about 1K more for
DateStamper itself).  If you can move your CCP, BDOS, and BIOS down by about
1K, you can install DateStamper above the BIOS.  Then the TPA space you lose
is only that required for the DateStamper code.  This TPA loss, however, is
permanent; you cannot recover it by not loading DateStamper (you can, of
course, boot from a vanilla CP/M disk).  With DateStamper running as an RSX,
it can be removed from memory when its presence is causing a problem.  Bruce
Morgen and I wrote a program (not yet distributed) called CLRRSX that will
remove DateStamper and any other RSXs present.
 
   It is very impressive how unobtrusively DateStamper functions.  I had
worried that all the accesses to the time/date file would slow things down,
but it turns out not to be noticeable.  I am very pleased with it.  The only
problem I have encountered is that when files are copied with standard
utilities, the destination file is given the current date/time rather than
the date/time of the source file.  This is, of course, not a defect of
DateStamper but of the utilities.  Gradually, as more of us use DateStamper,
utilities will be modified to support it.  I plan to add it to the next
release of VFILER and would like to add it to some general copy program like
PPIP, MCOPY, and/or AC.

--------------------  copy of message from Bridger Mitchell follows  -------
 
DateStamper is a CP/M 2.2 system extension for time-and-date-stamping of
files.  It occupies under 1K of high memory, either above/in the bios
or below the CCP and stamps the created, accessed and modified date-and-time
of each file.  Each directory entry has a corresponding 16-byte
entry in the special datestamper file, which is the first directory entry
and occupies the first unreserved groups on a disk.  A disk is prepared,
once, for datestamping with the PUTDS utility, which creates the file,
moving existing entries/groups if necessary.
 
Except for the use of the one directory entry and space for the file
(1K per 64 directory entries) DateStamper and non-datestamper disks
are totally compatible.  All disk i/o is done at the bios level,
with little overhead.
 
DateStamper runs with most any type of real-time clock. Or with none,
in which case it keeps the date plus  "relative time" - one tick per
file access.  The clock interface is portable - applications programs
can read the current time with an extended bdos-getversion call.
 
The major utilities supplied with DateStamper are SDD - an extension
of Super Directory to include created/accessed/modified dates/times,
and DATSWEEP - a many-featured file-maintenance program that supports
incremental file backup, etc. by date and time.  Applications programs
can obtain a file's datestamps through a specified interface.
 
DateStamper runs with the standard Digital Research CP/m 2.2 bdos,
with various Apple 2/2e z80 look-alikes, Magnolia-H/Z 89/90, ZRDOS,
and some other variants.  Not, however, with 3.0 or TurboDos.

Re: DateStamper requirements
Date: Fri, 22 Aug 86 11:12:13 PDT
From: bridger@RAND-UNIX.ARPA

DateStamper is a resident extension of the bios and bdos.  The
resident code is less than 1K for standard cp/m 2.2 and about 1.2 K
for apple/zrdos/... variants of cp/m.

Installation options are:

1. locate "above the bios" .  This requires free memory anywhere between
   the bios jump table and the top of memory.  Usually users need to run
   MOVCPM to create a 1K or 1.25K smaller system.  Some ZCPR3 users use
   the IOP buffer area (they don't use IO packages) and leave the system
   size unchanged.

2. locate below the ccp.  This makes the ccp resident too, and uses
   an additional 2K of memory.  The bios' warm-boot routine is bypassed,
   so the ccp/bdos remain resident.  A very few programs assume or require that
   nothing is resident below the ccp; they won't run with this
   installation option, nor with DDT or EX or ...

DateStamper runs with an unmodified cp/m 2.2 bdos and 8080 or z80-type
processors.  The longer (~1.2K) version runs with some non-standard
2.2-type dos's.  It is not compatible with cp/m 3, mpm, and most other networks.

DateStamper does not require a clock, but uses one if available.
If not, file access "times" are sequential numbers, plus the date.

The datestamping file is 1/2 the size of the directory for each disk
prepared for datestamping (usually 1 or 2K).  It must be the first
entry in the directory and occupy the first data groups on the disk.
Except for these requirements, datestamped disks are fully compatible
with any cp/m system.  The PUTDS utility creates this file, once, for
each disk.

Subj: ?big-board I bios defect
Date: Fri, 22 Aug 86 18:46:48 PDT
From: bridger@RAND-UNIX.ARPA


Beta-testing for BackGrounder has turned up a serious defect in a Big
Board I double-density 8" bios (19 June 83).  It handles sector
deblocking very inefficiently, resulting in a 20-fold slowdown in
effective disk i/o when reading then writing the same random records!

Does someone have a more recent version?  Is the problem present
in the BB II bioses also (the code contains lots of calls to "flush").
Is the author reachable?

Subject: MEX long distance codes?

The MEX modem program DOES handle alternate long distance codes.  Here
is an excerpt from the manual:

   Appendix 2: Alternate Long Distance Service numbers (ALDS):

This appendix details the use of Alternate Long Distance Service
(ALDS) numbers with MEX.

You may have two ALDS numbers defined; simply enter them as you would
any other number, but give them a name of '>' or '<' (normal delay
characters, passwords, etc may be included).  Then, if you have a
number you'd like to route through your ALDS service, simply prefix it
with the associated '>' or '<'.  An example should clarify this:

You have MCI service, your password is 98765, and it takes 2-4 seconds
to connect after the number is dialed.  You also have Sprint (you
cover all your bases, don't you?), the password is 12345, and it
sometimes takes 6 seconds to reach the number after it is dialed.
Finally, you have a Hayes Smartmodem; a comma in the dialing string is
a 2-second pause (is it really?  I don't have a Hayes, so let's
pretend).

In order to use both services, we'll put one number on the > key:

        [MEX] A0>>PHONE >=555-9122,,98765         <<--- MCI

note the four second delay with the two commas, then the password.

Now Sprint:

        [MEX] A0>>PHONE <=555-8144,,,12345

<longer delay, different password>.

Now RBBS Rockhead is a long, long distance call; it's available only
through Sprint (and, of course, Ma Bell). We decide that if we can't
make it through Sprint, we don't want to call RBBS Rockhead.  Here's
how we enter the number:

        [MEX] A0>>PHONE ROCKHEAD=<202-555-1414

Now RBBS Aristocrat is our favorite BBS; if Sprint is jammed up, we'd
like the option of dialing it over Ma Bell lines.  So we define it
without an ALDS marker, like this:

        [MEX] A0>>PHONE ARISTOCRAT=202-555-2222

Now notice that we can still call Aristocrat through Sprint or MCI
with:

        [MEX] A0>>CALL <ARISTOCRAT              <<--- Sprint
        [MEX] A0>>CALL >ARISTOCRAT              <<--- MCI

But we must explicitly enter the ALDS symbol in the CALL command.

Since Rockhead is defined with a leading '<', it will always go
through MCI; we don't have to supply an ALDS symbol in the CALL
command (we can switch to the other ALDS number, however, by
specifying the other ALDS symbol in the CALL command; eg,"CALL
>ROCKHEAD" will switch to MCI even though we've defined Sprint as
Rockhead's ALDS number).

In short, the left or right arrow specification is treated as if its
ALDS number were part of the number being dialed.

I think you are talking about the PC based version.  I purchased ECO-C for
my system and payed $300, along with a high-speed assembler and linker.
I have used it for quite awhile, and I like it.

Some disadvantages:
1) Comments nest.  Some people like this, but it causes problems when I
   want to port code from UNIX, and someone has commented out a line
   like this:
     /* x=2;   /* set x to 2 */
2) It is slow, but that is fairly well made up for by the assembler
   package.
3) It is missing the fread() and fwrite() routines.  They aren't hard
   to write, but it is a bother.
4) A bug:  if you reference off of a pointer using a negative subscript,
   it will crash the compiler.  that is 'x=ptr[-1];'  instead, I use
   'x= *(ptr-1);', which works just fine.

Some advantages:
1) The assembler they provide with it (SLR, at extra cost) is FAST.  They
   say it will manage six times the speed of M80, and it's true.  To those
   people out there still living with M80 and L80, I highly recommend
   changing over.
2) When the compiler gives error messages, they are good, with multiple
   lines of text, and even referencing a page number in the C book that
   comes along with it.
3) It is complete, with all data types supported, nested structures, unions,
   and all of the other little beasties that you want.
4) It provides routines to access the I/O ports, so you don't need to write
   assembly language routines to do this.
5) The manual is good.  They completely cover all of the function library,
   as well as all of the switches.
6) The provide the math functions.
7) You can get source to the libraries (send them floppies and $10).

I have not seen the problem with large modules mentioned, since I have taken
stuff right off of the net, and compiled it.  It does sometimes barf on
switch statements that contain more than about 128(?) cases.

Disclaimer: Just a happy customer.

I find myself in need of a utility to automatically insert change bars
into a document prepared by WordStar and printed by MailMerge.  The
preliminary research I have done has uncovered one possibility using
Carousel Microtools DIFF and FORMAT utilities which are similar to the
UNIX tools but run under CPM-80.  Does anyone know of any other tools
which may fit this need either public domain, shareware or proprietary?
The tools must run under either CPM (perferred) or MSDOS.

Please respond to Stenson at HI-MULTICS.

Thanks in advance!

Re:   LZW CRUNCHER and NSWP7 NULU

I have been using the LZW (or is it LWZ) crunch12, uncrunch12 and
typelz15 series. The speed and space savings are great.  I was
wondering if anyone knows or could tell me if NSWP7, NULU, Qlist and
similar programs can be modified to allow both squeezed and crunched
actions.  Has anyone heard if this is being done or do they know where
to get the files to allow one to integrate the LZW into those
programs.  Any info would be helpful to have.

Re:   Crunch Programs

Dan, the "new" programs (NSWP andLU) do not come with source, so
therefor we are at the mercy of the author to modify the programs.
Dave Rand is now in the PC/MS-DOS area and hasn't updated NSWP for
some time.  I don't know whats going on with NULU, there is still an
outstanding bug in that program, but I haven't seen and update for a
while.  The author said he would modify the program for ZCPR3.

Qlist does have source as I recall, but I think that program is
written in 8080 code, so it probably shouldn't be made machine
dependent by adding the CRUNCH routines which only support Z80 code.
There is supposed be a 8080 version of CRUNCH on its way.  Anyway, I
haven't seen any updates to Qlist.

I would like to add BISHOW to you list.  I really miss not working
with CRUNCHed files using that program.

     I have implemented P2DOS on an Ampro Little Board successfully. It's not
to difficult. If you're not using M80, then *don't* use LOAD.COM to make the
.COM file. Use MLOAD. LOAD will make a file that is much too big. Load
P2DOS.COM on top of your system image with DDT. In normal DRI CP/M 2.2, the
BDOS is at address 1180 in the system image. Hope this helps!

     The documentation that is in P2DOS.LBR is very scanty. Here is a very
brief rundown of some of P2DOS's features.

     o Written in Z80 rather than in 8080. Makes it smaller and presumably
       faster.

     o Supports an RTC through an extra BDOS call. Also supports date & time
       stamping, with the correct routines in your BIOS ( which the docs do
       *not* elaborate on ).

     o Supports Public files through one of the unused attribute bits ( #2, I
       think ). Any file set to a SYStem file, and with this atttribute set,
       can be accessed from any user area.

     o Supports a path-search feature akin to ZCPR3's, except at the BDOS
       level, rather than that of the CCP. Only SYStem files can be found in
       this way.

     o Expanded error messages. You are now told what the error is ( normal
       BDOS message ), what BDOS function caused the error, and the file
       involved, if any.

     I have had the combination of P2DOS and ZCPR3 running on my Ampro for
over a month now, and have noticed no bugs. On the other hand, I'm not using
all the features listed above.

Subject: TAC buffer expansion news

BBN recently updated the Arpa/Milnet TAC software to version #113.  As
I mentioned in a previous message, I am now able to upload files using
the 128-byte record "XMODEM Protocol" via any TAC that I have tried.
The input buffers were previously 64 bytes.

Today I tried using the 1k packet size option available in some newer
versions of micro and mainframe implementations of the various
versions of XMODEM.  It worked perfectly at 1200 bps through three
different TACs that I tried!

It would seem safe to assume that BBN has expanded the input buffers
on many, if not all, ports to over 1024 bytes.

If you have had problems in the past uploading to your host via a TAC,
try again.  Your TAC announces in the sign-on banner what version of
the software it is running.  If it says #113, you're in business!
