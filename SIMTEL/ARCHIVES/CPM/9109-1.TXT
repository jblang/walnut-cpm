   ok, there are several possibilities...
 
   if the amstrad numbers their sectors starting from 0 (which is strange)
as the first sector on the disk, and with X as the last sector on the disk,
it could be that the boot track was fried somehow.  you can repair that
type of damage with SYSGEN or similar utility on your system.  (note: some
implementations of CP/M do not come with sysgen, and you often can't lift
sysgen from one system and use it on another.  there is apparently something
hardware specific about it.)
 
   it is possible that the first sector of the directory was trashed, which
means that you either can reconstruct it to the point where you'll be able
to resurect the file(s) you want, or at least view it and write down the
block numbers by hand, and then use a sector/editor program like DU to
retrieve the blocks one by one (which i'll admit is kinda tedious for a
50 page file) and stick them into a file.
 
   if you could provide some more information about what error messages you
get when you try certain operations, then it would be easier to narrow down 
the problem so as to give you the correct help.

I don't know anything about the Amstrad, but I once had to use DU to
reconstruct a file, and I thought maybe this could be of use to you.

Who knows?

You can use DU to lift the data from a sector on one disk and then take
that disk out, put in the bad disk, and it can write that same sector to
the bad disk.  Thus, if you have a good disk and a copy of DU, you might
be able to restore that bad sector.  DU doesn't check for the disk being
the same one.  I had to do hundreds of sectors this way once, and it did
work.  It was just the books for my business for the entire year, and a
date with the tax auditor made the tedium somehow seem less significant
than the relief the success of the project produced.

Do try with a not so important disk first, to make sure you understand
how it works and that it actually does.

Of course, if there is something physically wrong with the disk, it won't 
work.

Wayne Sung wrote an article on interfacing a Bournelli drive to a CP/M 
computer in the January/February 1991 issue of The Computer Journal. It 
included both schematics and source code and involved adapting the 
parallel port to a SCSI port. Since SASI is the forerunner of SCSI, I 
would think you could get a headstart with Wayne's approach. You can 
order the back issue for $4.50 (US) or $6.00 (Foriegn, airmail) in US
funds. Ask for issue number 48.

Let me add my independant recommendation of TCJ, and that particular
article.  Issue 48 of TCJ was the very first I had ever seen, and I was
really impressed.  That article was the one that started me thinking
about a hard drive for my Amstrad again.  With some kind help of the
net (esp. people in sci.electronics) I found a source of bridge boards,
and bought one.

That article contained enough information for me to get my host
controller up and going.  The hardware for my drive is now almost done.
The parts used by the circuit described in the article are the sort of
thing that any self-respecting hardware hacker would have in his/her
junkbox... I don't think I actually bought anything to get the host
circuit up and going.

The software listed is sufficent for a CP/M 2.2 setup, but I am going to
have a little more fun writing the software for my banked (CP/M Plus)
setup.  The source listing provided is a good starting place though.  I
think it is even possible to get a copy of the source on magnetic media,
which should make things nicer for those who want to use it "as is".

Recently I have become the owner of a 'pile' of Kaypros

Yes, and here's another possibility:
If, as I suspect, this is a PCW with a 720k drive, and it's a 720k disc,
then the the disc may have been inserted the wrong way round.
I got fooled by this once.

I did send email to Anders about this, but haven't had any response, so I
don't know if it got through.

I ported MicroEmacs to CP/M. When I finished, there were no living
CP/M BBSes to post it to....

I never tried running it off a floppy; overlays are required,
and hard-disk performance was pretty good; the overlay most often in
memory contained page up/down, start-of-line, and so forth, in other
words
	the most common commands.

AZTEC-C was used for compiling.

Other limitations: no Regular Expression Search; no Search/Replace (
but you can search and then execute keyboard macro ); cannot keep up
with typing speed in two-window mode; maximum file size is about
30K, because the file is all in memory -- this is the maximum of ALL
FILES at once!

Good points: a REAL EDITOR that works under CP/M!!!!!
In one-window mode, it runs as fast as you can type.
Useful features added: go-to-next-sequential-buffer,
go-to-first-Word, and others... ( don't remember all the details ).

Now, the big question: where could I post this?
does anyone want to see it?
And, how do I post this source? I don't have a shar-wrapping
utility, just where is it on uunet and where do I get it?

Most Unix Boxes will also support vt52

there is a nice program called 'vt52.com' at SIMTEL20 and wuarchive's
simtel mirror, that allows  the old 2.5 MHz Kaypros to run at 2400 and 
4800 baud.

It's dumb terminal only (no logging, no up/downloads), but its very nice
for terminal usage.

Yes, there are a few people who still know CP/M exists.  Several 
of the Znodes and RCPM's carry a periodically updated list of 
who's still carrying CP/M software. Perhaps one of the unix 
archive sites (simtel20?) has it also ... file name of the latest 
release is CPMSVL-D.LBR.  
.
You might ask Jay Sage for information regarding Z-System 
utilities especially about Zmate (which he adapted from Pmate). 
.
There is also a Z-System floppy disk mailing service operated by 
Chris Ewens, the editor of 'The Computer Journal'.

NewWord or WordStar 4.0 if you're lucky enough to have it bundled 
with your system - and you like the WS diamond. Fast, unlimited 
file size, good range of printer drivers. Sweet.
.
VDE or ZDE ! Hands down the best WS diamond PD editor! Edited 
file is limited by available TPA, but you run fsplit13 on a large 
text file to split it into small enough chunks, edit the chunks 
with ZDE or VDE, then use CONCAT to paste the pieces again.
.
Can't comment on Zmate ... I've only had Zmate for a short while,
incredibly powerful and complex, needs Z-System.

There's a way of emulating MicroEMACS using the editor that 
comes with the MIX C compiler package but it's not very 
satisfactory.
You might (with a little work) be able to get Zmate to emulate 
MicroEMACS ... I haven't tried this since my fingers only know 
WS ... but reading the docs, it sounds possible to emulate (at 
least) the basic EMACS key strokes; (at best) a large chuck of the 
EMACS command set.
There was an editor that did emacs fairly well called MINCE
(MINCE Is Not Emacs) by Mark of the Unicorn - don't know if it's 
still available, had a good review in Microsystems.
Hope this helps.

VDE and ZDE, it's Z-system descendant, do much of what you want and 
supports macros.  The author is still working on it, unfortunately,
now in the PC environment (hey, he has to make a living... <grin>).  I
used it on my C=128 until the CP/M got to small for my genealogy database.
Now I use the PC VDE on my 386.  I've heard some people talk highly

The MIX editor does all you want, and the way it does reminds emacs.
More than 100 commands, macros, free key binding.

Look for any MIX ad in BYTE for example, phone them for their CP/M editor.
I paid them less than 20$ for it a few years ago. Less sportive than doing
it yourself, but MY time is money, what about yours?

Wayne Sung wrote an article on interfacing a Bournelli drive to a CP/M
computer in the January/February 1991 issue of The Computer Journal. It
included both schematics and source code and involved adapting the
parallel port to a SCSI port. Since SASI is the forerunner of SCSI, I
would think you could get a headstart with Wayne's approach. You can
order the back issue for $4.50 (US) or $6.00 (Foriegn, airmail) in US
funds. Ask for issue number 48.

Let me add my independant recommendation of TCJ, and that particular
article.  Issue 48 of TCJ was the very first I had ever seen, and I was
really impressed.  That article was the one that started me thinking
about a hard drive for my Amstrad again.  With some kind help of the
net (esp. people in sci.electronics) I found a source of bridge boards,
and bought one.

That article contained enough information for me to get my host
controller up and going.  The hardware for my drive is now almost done.
The parts used by the circuit described in the article are the sort of
thing that any self-respecting hardware hacker would have in his/her
junkbox... I don't think I actually bought anything to get the host
circuit up and going.

The software listed is sufficent for a CP/M 2.2 setup, but I am going to
have a little more fun writing the software for my banked (CP/M Plus)
setup.  The source listing provided is a good starting place though.  I
think it is even possible to get a copy of the source on magnetic media,
which should make things nicer for those who want to use it "as is".

Recently I have become the owner of a 'pile' of Kaypros

Joe Burger asked about sources of CP/M software.  The CP/M software vendor
list that someone else recently mentioned is a good place to look, but
unfortunately this list has not been maintained in recent years.  A good way
to keep up with those who are ACTIVELY supporting CP/M today is to read "The
Computer Journal" and the "Z Letter", whose editor/publishers can be
contacted at the following addresses:

Subject: S-100 Systems For Sale
Message-ID: <1991Sep4.204439.424@gss.com>

I have two older S-100 machines stored away in my closet at home. Now, because
I have no use for them and (more importantly) because my wife has even less
use for them, I would like to sell them. I have not attempted to power them
up in the last 5-7 years. Some particulars:

	Ithaca Intersystems DPS-1
	-------------------------

	  A front panel machine with 20 slot motherboard and a
	  honker power supply.

	  Two 8" floppy drives and a 5.25" floppy.

	  Numerous plug-in circuit cards:

		Godbout 8085/8088 CPU card
		Godbout Disk1 floppy drive controller card
		z-80 cpu
		Ithaca Intersystems floppy drive controller card
		8086 cpu (homebrew, wire-wrapped)
		Godbout Interfacer III i/o card
		(2) Godbout System Support I's (multifunction card)
		(2) 256kb memory cards
		Plug-in bus probe analyzer card
		etc...

	  This system cost over $6000 when it was bought new 10 years ago. Now,
	  $500 OBO takes it (you pay the shipping). I have manuals for some of
	  the cards but not all. There is a bunch of CP/M software also (CP/M2,
	  CP/M3, Pascal, Microsoft Basic, more...).


	Processor Technology SOL
	------------------------

	  This system was bought in 1978 from the Computer Mart of NY when
	  Stan Veit (now editor emeritus of Computer Shopper) owned the store.
	  It was (and still could be) a real example of one of the first and
	  best in micro's. It's case has walnut side panels (wow, haven't seen
	  this in any computers since).
	  
	  Unfortunately, it doesn't work right now. At one point it was used
	  in a warehouse for inventory control and the warehouse was unheated
	  in the winter. The warmth of the computer was an attraction too
	  strong for some of the resident rodent population which quickly took
	  up residence in the inside of the system. Their bodily fluids have
	  eaten away some of the pins of some of the chips on the system
	  board. The original assembly manual is part of the package, however,
	  so some enterprising electronics hobbyist should have no trouble
	  getting the thing to work again.

	  The system cost about $2500 when I first bought it. I don't really
	  know what to offer this system for but the best offer will get it.
	  Once again the buyer pays the shipping charges.

I won't quibble with the first part, but the second part of your statement is
certainly not true.  Perhaps you did not know about all the CP/M boards, but
there is quite a long list published every month.  I suppose this is a
further illustration of the big problem we in the 8-bit world are facing:
people who don't already know about the sources of support have no way to
find out about them.

>> Good points: a REAL EDITOR that works under CP/M!!!!!

That may be, but I think there are a number of other good, probably even
better possibilities.  For normal users ZDE is a very good performer.  For
'power' users -- the kind of people who would like Emacs or TECO -- there is
ZMATE (formerly PMATE).  It has fully bindable keys and an advanced macro
language capability.  It is quite fast, handles large files (via disk
swapping), and supports two windows.  ZMATE works with the Z-System TCAP to
configure automatically to the current terminal characteristics, including
the height and width of the screen.  The Computer Journal has a regular
column on PMATE macros.

VEDIT is a similar editor (I believe it started as a clone), but I have
always found it lacking in some critical areas where PMATE did things right. 
I also just heard that the author of VEDIT has dropped support of the CP/M
version of the editor.  I am currently supporting ZMATE.

The library files extract o.k. but the .com files do not run properly.
The program as installed will crash in varying places on varying machines,

program also crashes.  I would appreciate if you could attempt to replicate

                   ***************************

I have the MIX Editor for sale in both CP/M and PCDOS versions.  
Among the many excellent features of the MIX Editor are the 
ability to work on two files simultaneously.  The manuals for the 
MIX C and the MIX Editor cover both the CP/M and the PCDOS 
versions.

The software is available on many UNIFORM supported 5.25" (DD) 
CP/M and IBM-PC (360K) disk formats.  I prefer to use TeleVideo 
(5.25", DD, DS, 48tpi) CP/M disks, since I use TeleVideo 
computers and therefore I can test the disk before shipping.  
Please specify your choice.

The price for each of the above software packages is only $20.00 
plus $5.00 for shipping and handling (UPS ground, in the 
continental US).  Orders shipped to a California address must 
include 8.25% sales tax.  If you order both the CP/M and PCDOS 
versions of either the MIX C compiler or MIX Editor the price is 
only $25.00 plus $5.00 for S&H (UPS ground, in the 48 contiguous 
states).  At this special low price only one manual is provided.  

Contact me at any address below for shipping charges outside the 
US (48 contiguous states) or for additional information.  Thanks 
for your interest.  Take care.

                    ** System Requirements **

                         MIX C Compiler

CP/M version:                  MS/PCDOS version:

CP/M 80 (2.0 or higher)        128K memory
55K memory                     1 disk drive
2 disk drives or HD

                           MIX Editor

CP/M version:                  MS/PCDOS version:

Z80 CPU                        PCDOS (2.0 or higher)
CP/M 80 (2.0 or higher)        192K memory
55K memory
1 disk drive

You can't.  It is a common misconception, started by a misdirected magazine
writer, that Z80MU is public domain.  It is NOT, and the article has caused
considerable grief and hard feelings at the company that actually developed
Z80MU.

Actually, on second thought, I'm sure they would be happy to sell you a
source license, for the right price.  Here is their address:

Subject: Anyone have a source listing for BIOS w/DTC520 controller??
Message-ID: <1991Sep8.074704.16455@techbook.com>

   I'm looking for a sample BIOS source listing for a z80 with a DTC520
controller.  I found a bunch of controllers at a great price and am wondering
what i'm getting myself into in trying to incorporate some of these into
some machines i have.
 
   this controller supports 2 hard drives and 4 floppies.  It uses a
proprietary host interface, but i have all the information needed to build
the host adaptor.

   Z80 opcodes would be preferred, but since beggars can't be choosers, i'll
struggle with 8080 opcodes if need be.

   I've been wanting to play around with new fast Z80s for a while and this
controller seems like just the ticket for such a project, since i won't
have to worry about building a hard disk interface, just the host adaptor
and a little bit of software.

Subject: QX-10 Hard Disk (Comrex Comfiler) questions
Message-ID: <3312@tamsun.TAMU.EDU>

Howdy!  'gratulate me!  'gratulate me!
 
I just bought an Epson QX-10 with a Comrex CR-1510 ComFiler hard disk!!
Unfortunately, the ComFiler flaked out very soon after I got it home.  I
was wondering if there is any chance of resurrecting it.
 
The man I bought it from was one of those "befuddled users" who just
managed to stumble through enough of ValDocs to write letters and never
bothered to become proficient with it or the machine.  Consequently, the
hard disk was not connected when I went to examine the machine nor were
any logical drives assigned to HD1 and HD2.  I decided to hook the disk up
and see what it was all about.  After noting the orientation of the
connector on the interface card in the QX-10, the hard disk was turned on.
 
A directory of the disk (which I assigned to C: and D: via SETUP) appeared
with no hint of trouble.  I had brought FBAD v7.0 with me and it declared
that there were no bad blocks on either C: or D:.  Satisfied with the
performance, I paid the man and took my new play-toy home.  I must note
that I was unable to locate references to any disk-parking software either
in the manuals or on any disks I had immediately at hand.  Thus, I simply
turned the system off (CPU first, then the hard disk--as I _later_ learned
is correct).
 
When I set the system up at home, all appeared to be well at first.  I got
a directory listing of the disk and was satisfied that I had done no serious
damage by not parking the heads.  I then worked with files on floppies
exclusively for about three hours (maintenance and exploration).  I then
attemped to access the hard disk.
 
Lo, and behold!  I was greeted with a 'Not Ready' error.  A retry resulted in
a 'R/W' error and after a few 'Continue' selections, I got only a partial
directory listing with a few more 'R/W' errors (with Bad Sector reports).
As I had chosen a poor orientation for the drive which blocked the outflow
air vents, I assumed that thermal drift (expansion of the disk causing head/
track mis-alignment) had occured thus accounting for the errors.
 
I shut the system down (this time parking the heads) and let it cool off over
night.  I relocated the drive the next morning and started it up.  No dice!
The drive behaved as erratically as it had the night before.  As I worked
with it, it got progressively worse right before my eyes until I got nothing
but error messages ('R/W' errors).
 
I decided that there was nothing left but to reformat the drive.  (I had the
original floppies for anything of consequence to me.)  The manual says that
formating the 10MB disk would take aboout 25 minutes.  It sat there for 3
hours!!  It very slowly counted off the cylinders and heads until it logged
"Cyl 305  Head 3" at which point the program declared:  "Drive Format
Failure--Contact your dealer for service"  Subsequent access to the disk
results in 'R/W' errors on every sectory of cylinder 0, head 0.  I ran
the other diagnostic software that was supplied and the disk passes a random
seek test and the controller passes its diagnostic tests.
 
Examination of the system revealed that the interface card in the CPU appears
to just bring the expansion buss out to the back of the machine.  From
there, a 40-pin ribbon cable runs through the hard disk enclosure and plugs
into a Western Digital 1002 Hard Disk Controller.  The actual disk mechanism
is a 5.25" Full-height MFM drive by Computer Memories, Inc., model CM5412.
Configuration is 306 Cylinders, 4 Heads.  I suspect that this is analogous
to a Seagate ST-412.  The configuration is also the same as the IBM PC-AT
Type 1 drive.

Could anyone help me test the drive mechanism or any other part of the
system for "low cost" (knowwhutahmean?).  Are there any drives matching the
above configuration available (new or used)?  If a larger disk will replace
it, is there a way to use the full capacity?  I would also appreciate some
education on hard disk systems as implemented on CP/M machines as I have
never used a hard disk on any CP/M machine.  (And it may be some time before
I do.)
 
Thanks.

Perfect writer, although a bit slow, does good emacs emulation, provides
the ability to display multiple windows and supports large files via disk
swapping.  It also has a very powerful text formatting language.
Unfortunately, the company that made it went out of business years ago, and
I do not know what happened to either the rights to sell or the source.

This last saturday afternoon I acquired a Cromemco Z-2H computer.
it's an s100 bus system, with a dual Z80/68000 processor board among
other nice things.  anyways, the guy I got it from said it just needed
the operating system. a friend of mine has copies of the Cromix
operating system (Cromemco Unix) and helped install it...

while installing the operating system on the hard disk, the disk froze up
and died. in the process of fixing it, a few hardware items got zapped
anyways....

does anyone have a Cromemco DPU or XPU processor board and/or a 16FDC or
64FDC board that they want to sell/donate/trade?  also other S100 hardware
that runs with the 32-bit 68000 processor would be nice...

A CP/M sharwrapping program? Think shar15.lbr is on simtel20, and 
it will do if you just want to post ascii.  you'll probably also 
want the uuencode and uudecode pair from simtel20 to post or mail 
object and compressed files.

Subject: My new(!) QX-10 just died! :-(
Message-ID: <3324@tamsun.TAMU.EDU>

The Subject: says it all.  The QX-10 I just recently acquired has "winked out".

Situation:  I was online to tamuts.tamu.edu and reading alt.folklore.computers
	    (I had been on a few hours) when I heard my phone make the little
	    "dink" noise it makes whenever a phone is taken off-hook or
	    replaced on-hook (a cheap UniSonic from Walmart).

	    I though that my room-mate had picked up the phone (again) knock-
	    ing me off-line.  But, when I looked at my screen, there was no
	    garbage as I had expected.  In fact, the screen held the unblem-
	    ished image of the last message I had read.  I typed <space> a few
	    times to go on to the next message.  Then I typed <Return> and
	    'q' and lot of other stuff and nothing was happening.  I looked
	    at my modem and noticed that nothing was being sent and then
	    that I was, in fact, on-hook.  I should have seen characters
	    coming back at me.

	    I tried of exit my comm program (ZMP 1.5) with no success.
	    I had locked the machine before so I fugured it would be a simple
	    matter of re-booting.  the sequence <ctrl><grph shift><stop> (for
	    those who know the Valdocs Document Processor keyboard)
	    did nothing.  Well, let's try the hardware RESET button under
	    the ledge of the case.

	    NOTHING!!   I pressed, released, then held for a while and released
	    and absolutely nothing happened.  So I decided to turn it off and
	    then on againn (power cycling as I've heard it called).

	    Again nothing.  No 'INSERT DISKETTE' message, no disk drive homing,
	    no flashing keyboard lights.  The only thing that appeared to work
	    was the cooling fan.  The power supply seemed to be humming a
	    a little louder than usual.

	    I opened it to see if there was any obvoious damage that would
	    indicate the fault.  I could see no gross damage.  (I looked at
	    and removed and examined all circuit boards.)  everything looks
	    OK on the outside.

Can anyone out there help me?  Any suggestions as to what could have failed and
caused this.  Any clue as to the nature of this failure.  Also any suggestions
as to where I might obtain service for this machine if the fix is not simply a
chip or other componet replacement.  I have neither the time, tools or experi-
ence to tackle a complicated bit of repair (but I have the enthusiasm).

I had no indication that the machine might fail when I bought it.  I has
operated just fine for the two weeks that I have had it.  (Just like I thought
the Hard Disk was OK.)

Thanks for the help.  Calling all QX-10 gurus!!!

Message-ID: <pjb.684456294@hss>

I have been given a Heath/Zenith H8 (8080 based) with some software 
(kermit, basic, fortran, maybe C but I haven't found it yet). 

I am interested in accessing the com port in this system programmitically.
Is there anything like the IBM BIOS calls that read and write one char to 
the com port like there are on DOS systems??

I have manuals for BASIC, and FORTRAN, and they do not mention anything
about opening the COM port as a file. Attempting to do this (the Com port
has a name something with a colon) gave a bad disk file name error, so I 
assume that open is disk-oriented only.

Any ideas? I can access the com port through kermit, but obviously this 
isn't all i'm after here.

However, he is searching for support, and other programs to run on his

Because the of the distance between us, in New Zealand, and Texas it
would be difficult for us to provide support.  If there is someone
nearer to this person (at least in the US!) who has knowledge of the
Kaypro II and is willing to help out, please Email me.  I will pass on
the name/address I have.

Thank you for your attention; we return you to the regular broadcast
:-)

John, hopefully someone on the net has just the experience to help you. 
But if that turns out not to be the case, then let me point you to the

While wuarchive.wustl.edu is down you may access the SIMTEL20 mirrored
files on oak.oakland.edu [141.210.10.117].  Anonymous FTP is available

Message-ID: <AGW.91Sep12095612@flounder.cs.columbia.edu>

Hello.

One of my students has an old CP/M machine and a new MS-DOS machine (I
don't have the particulars).  He also has a bunch of ASCII files on
CP/M disks that he would like to be able to read on his MS-DOS box.

Does anybody out there know of any CP/M to MS-DOS ascii file
conversion programs he can use?

Please mail me your responses, as I don't read this newsgroup.
Thanks.

Subject: H-8 COM PORT

In reference to the question about the H-8 COM port, you did
not state whether the machine was running under HDOS or CP/M
You also did not (assuming that it is CP/M) mention what version
of dos you are running.  If you are using CP/M 2.0 or up the
configur program should allow you to set up port 330Q for the modem
you should access it via device UR1: .  This is as per my book on
Heath/Zenith CP/M version 2.2.xx.  Configur is rather easy to follow
through the menus,  that is as easy as CP/M ever is.

I have discovered that the files CPSCOM.ASM, CPSPK2.ASM, CPSREM.ASM
and CPSUTL.ASM in the file PD2:<CPM.KERMIT>CP411SRC.ARK are corrupt;
repeat-prefixing negotiations appear to have misfired when I
transferred those files to my archiving system.  There are also a
couple of explanatory files missing from CP411SRC.ARK.  Accordingly, I
have uploaded to Simtel20 a corrected copy of CP411SRC.ARK.

Cheers!

Anyone desperate for a "real editor," old enough to remember TECO,
and crazy enough to remember it fondly, can search out and obtain
TED.  TED is an editor patterned after old TEC124 on TOPS-10, with
a bunch of TECO-11 things thrown in, and some completely new things
as well.

I wrote it about 13 years ago, and long ago uploaded it, binaries
and sources and documentation, to various bulletin board systems.
Good luck!

I picked up a Systems Group box last Thursday; a Systems Group
System 2800; and it's got more software than I can handle (unless
of course I wanted to become a CPA :-) ).  Just wondering, does
anyone have manuals for the hardware?  I probably have enough in
the form of BIOS source code and perhaps specsheets for the
Z80CTC and the Z80DART, but I wouldn't mind having the books.
Also, anyone have a communications driver?

I may have performed poorly, but I failed to discover any organizer program
(I mean, calendar, schedules, things to do) under CP/M in the SIMTEL stuff.

Since I unfortunately have only one CP/M engine at home, none in office,
I would greatly appreciate any such CP/M organizer coming with its source
code, to be able to use the same file structure on the same organizer
on that horrible PC-clone which plagues my office.

I need a bootable system disk for a Sanyo MBC-1200.  It is a 
5-1/4 inch disk but I have no idea as to it's density or 
format.  Maybe there is some old CP/M'er out there who might 
have such a disk.  The computer is quite old.  I found it in

You might want to contact Herb Johnson at 1519 Mt. Everett Street, 
Colorado Springs, Colorado 80909. I understand that he is commercially 
involved in buying and selling S-100 boards and so should probably have 
what you want. If he doesn't, he can get it.

  Jensen Tools (I think in Tempe, AZ) is a large electronics tool company

that I don't have a better address.

  You might also try calling Dysan (I think they have an 800 number, so
try directory assistance), and ordering from them directly.

I must have missed the earlier article. As the publisher of the journal 
in question, perhaps I can give the information previously requested. 
Larry Moore is right about the subscription costs within the US. For 
"Outside-US" subscriptions, the cost is $24/1 year, $44/2 years by surface
or $38/1 year, $72/2 years by airmail.

Larry is "Not Quite Right" on the complimentary issue. Yes, anyone who 
sends name and address, either by email, snail mail, telephone call or 
carrier pigeon, and requests a "trial subscription" will be given a copy. 
If you like TCJ, then just pay the invoice that will come. But you DO NOT 
HAVE TO RETURN THE COPY if you don't like it! Just pass it on to someone 
who might, and return the invoice to me, marked "Cancelled."

Thanks, Larry, for answering the inquiry. I appreciate your 
thoughfulness.

I have uploaded pd2:<cpm.dskutl>TRANF18.ARK to SIMTEL20.

It is a system independant version of the TRANSFER utility, a program
to transfer files between CPM and DOS (both directions).  Transfer1.8
doesn't replace version 1.2 in the archives allthough it derived from
the same original program.  TRANSFER 1.8 is supposed to be compatible
with CPM 2.2 and CPM+.  Documentation is included in the archive.

Message-ID: <1991Sep16.030828.27777@usenet.ins.cwru.edu>

Hello.  Do you have a TI 99/4a collecting dust in your closet?

If you do then maybe you should get it out. A lot of things have
changed (improved) in the last few years.

We now have Hard Drive controllers, fifth generation video 
processors (Many graphic viewing formats, RLE,GIF etc) and
Ram disks.

Do you remember how slow your TI was (3.3 MHz I beleive)
well now we even have an accelerator that fits inside of your
console and replaces the CPU with a chip running currently at 
16 MHZ.  The TMS9900 chip is basically replaced by a TMS99105.
The 99105 has a potential for 24 Mhz.

If you are interested and want more info about the TI then
please respond via email to gilpin@snowhite.EEAP.CWRU.Edu
or post to the comp.sys.ti on the usenet.


Have a nice day.

Since we don't know what organizer you are using in the office, finding 
one that duplicates it will present a bit of a problem. I know of one 
fairly extensive organizer in CP/M called HANDY. I have it on my bbs's 
CPM: (B0:) directory in a file named HANDY.LBR. Unfortunately, it does 
not include source code. Sorry, no ftp here -- you'll have to come and 
get it at (908) 754-9067.

Hope that helps.

I have tried e-mail, but looks like it bounced, so I am posting this to the
newsgroup.
I've got a Geneva PX-8 with the standard software package (wordstar, etc),
120k ramdisk wedge and stationary (non-portable) dual 5 1/4 inch disk drive
module for it.  Everything is in working condition, and I've got original
packaging for everything.  Battery in it is ok also.  I have barely used it
ever since I got it about 1.5 years ago, 'cause I could not find a file
transfer program for it to work with my other systems.  I've heard of generic
version of filink, but could not obtain it anywhere.  So, it just have been
sitting on the shelf.  If you are interested, let me know how much you can
offer for all the stuff.  I would rather get rid of the whole thing.

I think that there were later editors also called TED, so you may not
have the one that I wrote.  At any rate, I have a document that I wrote
for it; it doesn't exactly match the distributed version, since somebody
else actually wrote a better document for it later, and that was used
instead.  (I don't have access to that other document.)

A test to find out if what you have is the TED that I wrote:

Run the program (type TED)

You'll get a single-character prompt (an asterisk or a pound sign,
something like that, depending on the version).  type

ex$$

where the '$' are ESCAPE keys (they echo as '$').  This will exit the
editor. 

If this isn't what you get, then you probably don't have my editor.  If
this is what you get, then I can send you the document if you'd like.

Message-ID: <3160@umriscc.isc.umr.edu>

I am a newcomer to this group, but have been using CP/M 2.2 on my Apple II+
since 1985.  I use a patched version that allows me to use a 360K Rana Elite II
floppy disk drive.  This patch is applied using a .com program that was 
provided by Rana, who is now defunct.

What I need is the annotated source for cpm56.com so that I can figure out what
was patched.  The reason why I want to determine what was patched is so that I
can patch something like ZCPR, etc. to use the capabilities of my Rana drive.
Currently, the Rana patch and the ZCPR patch clash, making an unusable version
of cpm56.com that supports ZCPR _and_ the Rana drive.

I tried asking about this on the apple group, but got no answers.  Can anybody
help me or point me to a book that would have the information I need?

1-I didn't make myselk clear, it seems. I asked for the source code to port
the CP/M program to MS-DOS so that both machines use compatible data files.

2-Would HANDY.LBR be found by chance on some CP/M-UG disk?

   same here, except a slightly different request - information leading
to the incorporation and programming of a Z80DMA chip into a homebrew
system.  for some strange reason that escapes me, information on that
chip (and the Z80DART, although folklore has it the DART is a SIO that
doesn't do sync comm) is extremely hard to come by...

Message-ID: <9109171052.AA15075@LL.MIT.EDU>

   A little while back, Dmitry Grinauz asked about Perfect Writer.  Indeed,
the company that made it is no longer in business.  However, they gave
permission to my group at the Boston Computer Society (the ZITEL Group) to
distribute the software.  There are no longer any manuals, but I am told by
the leader of the group (who uses PW himself) that there is a DOC file with
enough information to use the program.  He also said that anyone familiar
with EMACS would feel at home immediately.

   At the meeting of the group last week I spoke to the disk librarian.  He
was, unfortunately, a bit vague about the procedures for getting a diskette. 
He seems to expect people to call him by phone -- not so easy for people
outside the Boston area (let alone out of the country).  I think the
following procedure will work to get a catalog disk listing our holdings
(and, I hope, giving full order instructions).  Send a blank, formatted,
well-labeled diskette in a reusable mailer together with a return address
label, return postage, and perhaps $1 for ZITEL to:

        Dave Veinot
        24 Menotomy Road
        Arlington, MA 02174

For those who can call, his phone number is 617-641-0889.  If stamps and
currency are a problem, let me know and we can work out something.  After
all, ZITEL maintains this library so that we can help people get software.

   Another possibility is the following.  Plu*Perfect Systems (Bridger
Mitchell) and Sage Microsystems East (my wife's company) have available an
improved version of the software called Plu*Perfect Writer (guess what the
original product of Plu*Perfect Systems was).  PPW was sold originally as an
upgrade to PW and assumed that the purchaser had a PW manual; PPW comes only
with a DOC file with information on the improved features.  I do not use PW
or PPW myself, so I cannot tell you now what those improvements are, but I
can assure you -- based on my knowledge of Bridger Mitchell's other work --
that it is very much worth having.  I think the price is $35.

There will be no one to catalog the MS-DOS, CP/M and MISC repositories

A while back I wads kicking up a fuss about distributions going haywire,
and none of my messages leaving the good old U.S. of A. Well, one person
who replied to my message pointed out that:

It occurs to me that perhaps it would be a good thing to check what's
going on: I get about 2 to 3 to 4 messages a day here. If people outside
the U.S. are seeing less than this, then something is not working right.

Subject: Kaypro-10 Disc Stuck
Message-ID: <685223151@bronto.cs.duke.edu>

I have a Kaypro-10 which was working fine when I stuck it in the closet
about a year ago. When I had occasion to resuscitate it recently, I
found to my dismay that the hard disc would not spin up. It makes a
couple of muffled "clunk" sounds when I power it up, but that's it. The
computer is OK, because I can boot it from floppies, but needless to
say, the HD has 99.9% of my files on it (I know, I know... backups :-(

Anyway, does anyone out here know of a way to jumpstart the disc short
of physical destruction? I looked for little holes and tool access
ports but found nothing obvious. Any suggestions would be greatly
appreciated.  If I get it going, I will probably soon post a "Kaypro 10
for sale" ad, so the person who solves the problem gets a good
discount.

Thanks,

Oh, I agree with that.  The trouble is that this letter turned up out of
the blue, with very little information in it other than someone who had a
Kaypro and wanted support.  From New Zealand, it is difficult to support
someone in Texas.... :-)  Perhaps someone else who is contacting him (I
have passed the address onto a couple of people) could mention the
wonders of modems.

As a side note, what is the volume in CPMTECH like?  I might be
interested in getting it brought into New Zealand, but that would mean
someone paying the bills...

Agreed. I'm in the process of trying to write an interrupt driver for the
Kaypro, the only problem (as far as I can tell) is that I need to do some
other "interrupt related" things myself, because I'm messing with the
interrupts, and may wind up screwing something up.

However it ought to be possible.

Also agreed - you're presimably talking about the case when the text data
is arriving too fast. However most all CP/M systems can dump printable
characters to the screen in almost no time at all. It's things like scrolling
the screen and some of the other strange functions that start taking time.
provided there's a reasonable amount of text output as text, it ought to
work OK. Consider the C128 - that's slower than the Mississippi in the
summertime getting text to the screen, but it can still keep up at 2400
with an interrupt driven serial driver.

I'd love it if they had - cuz it'd save me a pile of work. However, I'll
get this beaten senseless yet. Either that or die trying. :-/

I am in the way of porting a few programs from CP/M 2.2 to CP/M+ and
have no access to CP/M+ manuals.  I tried to do sector or record I/O in
CP/M+ but couldn't get it to work. 

I know
-	how to call the BIOS with a BIOSPB ...
-	that the BIOS READ and WRITE do physical, not logical I/O
-	that the SECTRAN call translates from logical to physical

I don't know
-	how exactly to call SECTRAN
-	how to determine the physical sector size
-	why I didn't manage to get ANY read to work yet 
	(Track0, Sector1 should work even if my assumptions 
	on Sector numbers are wrong)
-	what happened to the deblocking flags from CP/M2.2
-	if (maybe) there are new flags in CP/M3

Any help will be appreciated.

I have a Kaypro II and a Kaypro 4 with Advent TurboROM upgrades.  I
happen to notice that it looks like the code for the TurboROM was,
in some way, jointly developed with Plu*Perfect.  However, nothing I
have says how to contact the folks at Plu*Perfect.

This seems like a good time to ask:  How can I contact Plu*Perfect

You may be lucky and have a drive just like my original Shugart 604. That
one reminds me from time to time that it loves being petted: look from the
rear thru the blind between the printed card and the body of the drive.
You will perhaps see a stainless steel drum. Learn how to introduce your finger
(NO METAL PART) and exercise gently spinning the drum, with power off. When
you feel you begin to love the drive (and will therefore NEVER get rid of
your CP/M baby), power up and help the drive start. With a little bit of love
from your side, it will serve you for long years to come...

I hope I am not abusing this net to just inform myself. This note follows
a report of an attempt to recompile HANDY with CBASIC2.

1-Re PD2:<CPM.DATABASE>HANDYS (the source file). Its DOC says that the
author converted if from CBASIC2 to CB80. People who wish to compile with
CBASIC2 could perhaps ask the author for the original CBASIC2 code...

2-In the same directory, 00INDEX.TXT says that the contents of HANDYP10.LBR
is unknown: it's a hidden GEM ( a real GEM, not an Atari): it's HANDY extended
and written in dBase ][ language, with quite a bit of powerful additional
features. Incredibly enough, it isn't in PD1:<MSDOS.DATABASE> nor <.DBASE>.
But porting it to MSDOS, and shuttling the data file diskette between the
two systems, is very easy, and solved my problem.

Try taking the hard disk unit out of the computer so that you can move it
freely in space.  Being careful not to drop it or throw it across the room
accidentally, try jerking the platters loose by quickly twisting it back and
forth about the axis of rotation of the platters.  I have actually done this
once with an old Seagate full-height HD and it worked without losing any info.
However, I make no guarantees...

	Greetings. Wow, another Kaypro 10 user! I got mine for $10 WORKING! -	
	I don't think you will give me a discound _that_ good! :-)

	Anyways, I have a drive just like that in my IBM XT. It's a 20MB
	28ms deal and instead of tossing it, I drilled a hole in the computer
	case, took off the static strap, made a handy-dandy "crank", and
	everyday, before turning on the power, I spin it up - MANUALLY!

	It brings a new meaning to the saying: 

	"The XT is to PC's what Model T was to cars" ;-)

	SERIOUSLY, what you need to do is this:

	Take off the screws, 2 on top, 4 on each side (phillips).
	Take out the hard disk controller card (4 screws) - remember
	how the cables go!
	Take out the floppy drive (4? screws from bottom)
	Take off cables from floppy drive and hard drive - same for power.
	Take out the 4 screws from the bottom that hold the HD cage.
	Disconnect the 80-pin ribbon cable.
	Take out the 4 screws that hold the HD in metal box.
	On the PCB side, in the middle of the board, there should be
	a metal strap (grounding) - if there is a screw, take it out,
	if not, just bend the metal.

	HERE IT IS: With a small screwdriver, spin the "wheel" a few revs.
	
	IF YOU MANAGE TO ASSEMBLE THE COMPUTER, THE HARD DRIVE WILL SPIN UP!

	I'm serious, this is the only way on the K10. 

	In my PC, I just installed the drive up side down and took off
	the grounding strip completely. The hole in the case is aligned with
	the hole that was left when I took the carbon "plug" out. The plug
	is used as a bearing for the contact area where the static strap
	touches the spinning motor. I just insert the crank, crank it a
	few times, and hit the BIG RED SWITCH and it boots just fine - as
	it has for 1+1/2 years!

	Take care.

	P.S. So, what's the deal on NEVER mounting a hard drive up side down?
	I put over 1,000 hours on mine (with thre above problem) :-)

I am certainly prepared to commit myself to take a 10 years subscription

I certainly would not write this so "straight" if he wasn't already

I am looking for the book "C-128 CP/M User's Guide" by Abacus.  It's book #8
in their series on the Commodore 128.

Would prefer new but good used is acceptable.  Please email with whereabouts
and price.

Thanks!

Message-ID: <1991Sep20.225340.9337@tandem.com>

I'm not sure of the etiquette here, so I'll keep this short.  I publish one
of the few CP/M and Z-System magazines left.  It's called The Z-Letter, and
it's been monthly, with a new 8-1/2 x 11" format, since November 1990.  
(Before that it had a different format and was very occasional.)

The Z-Letter carries letters, articles, news, and advertisements from
companies that sell CP/M and Z-System software and hardware.  The September
issue, which will be out shortly, will carry the complete parts list and
schematics for the new YASBEC computer.  If you would like a free sample
issue of The Z-Letter, send me your address, and I'll send you a copy.  Of
course I hope you'll subscribe ($15 per year U.S., $18 Canada & Mexico, $45
overseas).  I'm also looking for distributors to make The Z-Letter cheaper
overseas, especially Australia, New Zealand, and Europe.

I have a Kaypro II and a Kaypro 4 with Advent TurboROM upgrades.  I
happen to notice that it looks like the code for the TurboROM was,
in some way, jointly developed with Plu*Perfect.  However, nothing I

CRR0120.ZIP is the latest version.

In my opinion QWK is a duff standard, and very few of the readers 
based on that file format generate messages which conform with 
Fidonet specifications. (The messages will be thrown away by the 
Zone1 echomail backbone software.)

XRS-Door (by Mike Ratledge) only works for Remote Access, 
QuickBBS, and SuperBBS based bulletin boards, although a bundler 
for *.MSG type message bases is currently being written.

  sure - just toss source in so i can see what you're doing.  
 
  another possibility that works, albeit a hardware solution, is to pull
the Z80 from its socket, bend pin 24 up, reinsert the chip with pin 24
still sticking up, and solder one leg of a 220 ohm resistor to pin
24.  solder a wire onto the other leg, and run it to a +5 source in the
computer. (pin 11 on the Z80 will do.)
 
  stick one end of a 220-1000 ohm resistor into pin 24 of the Z80s
socket (making sure it does not touch pin 24 of the Z80) and tie
the other end to Z80 pin 29.
 
  what this does is eliminate the WAIT state that was built into the
kaypro.  i haven't tried this on a kaypro, only on a TRS80 model II,
and had good success getting it to keep up at 2400 baud.
 
  bear in mind, this mod is not guarenteed (only do this if you've done
stuff like this before).   don't hold me responsible if you blow up your
machine.

  a little clarification - i'm not even sure if there was a wait state
or two added to the kaypro machine cycle, however i do remember this
was a common practice way back when, and it mainly was because of the
memory chips being used.  most were conservatively rated, and most
machines will work with the wait state removed.  this mod speeds up a
TRS80 Mod II about 20-25%.
 
  some boot roms are too slow to operate without the wait state, and some
disk format programs use CPU timing cycles as part of their operation,
so this will not work on those machines.
 
  if you do this mod, the first thing you should try when you complete
the hardware side of it is to boot the machine and try to format a
disk.  if everything still works right, then i'd say it's safe...
 
  and even if it does not work, it's easy to undo...

Subject: HELP! My computer is dead!
Message-ID: <1991Sep23.220043.777@ns.network.com>

  I have a Bigboard II computer.  It was acting rather flakey for a while
(the thing would make a strange noise, freeze up, and have a faint odor of
something burning), but I could reboot and everything would be fine.  Well
my wife was using it when this happened and she left it in that state while 
she called me at work to find out what to do .. now it's totally dead.

  I checked the power supply first and found that when the power supply
is connected to the computer the 5v supply drops to about 2.5v.  So I
connected up a resistor (alternate load), the voltage held steady, so I
concluded that there must be a partial short in the computer (feel free
to correct me at any point).  So I pulled out all of the ICs (in groups)
and reconnected power, still 2.5v, so I guess its not the ICs.  Now I
guess it might be a Cap, Diode, or Resistor, but it's a fair amount of
work to pull those off the board.  Anybody out there got any ideas, or
even better some experience fixing this type of computer?

  Thanks in advance, for any help you can send my way.

________________________________________________________________

I have built a Z80 based system. Now, I am trying to develop some
piece of software for this system. I have been using a Z80
asmbler to develop a program. For simple programs just using asmbler
is not a problem, but for long and complicated programs it needs more
care and insight into low-level programming.
        Is there any way to develop software in a high-level language

        Any help will be very much appreciated.

The immediate solution is:

A3> pip a:=c:*.*[g0]                  (gotta add them square brackets!)

make patches for my Rana Elite II drive on CP/M versions other than CP/M 2.2.

Thanks in advance,

The main question here is:
  What kind of system do you use for development?
For CP/M systems there is a wide choice of compilers. (See the CP/M
compiler list) I'm not sure about cross-compilers for MS-DOS...

I wouldn't mind contributing either, if my status as 'unemployed' would
change.  Unfortunately, I don't think it will anytime soon.

Also, as SimTel20 (and hence Keith's position) is somehow funded by the US
government, I would find it very unlikely that even if _every_ subscriber
to comp.os.cpm petitioned for its continued existance, the decision would
be reversed.  It boils down to money, and Uncle Sam has decided that the 
CP/M community is no longer worth holding onto.

It would seem prudent to investigate ways of minimizing the effect that
losing SimTel20 (and Keith) will have to our archiving/retreiving ability.  
I understand there was another site somewhere that 'mirrored' SimTel20;
true?  Will that system also be closing shop?  Or will it become the prime
archive site for comp.os.cpm ?  Might it be possible to convince some
other site to provide a home for said archive?  If there is such a site,
but is lacking in administrative manpower to handle the load, I think we
can suggest a qualified canidate (right Keith? ;-)).

wuarchive.wustl.edu has an archive in pub/mirrors/cpm, which seems to be
fairly complete.  I have no idea what their submission policy is, or if they
take submissions to the mirrors directory.

	Greetings. There was once a discussion on where to find a PL/I
	compiler. Well, I found something like that but for MS-DOS.

	I ran it on my 486 without problems. It came as a ZIP file which
	contained the executable, GET THIS! 290K of C source ;-), and
	a bunch of examples (hey, one of them calculates PI to any
	number of digits - provided you can wait, and I mean, wait... :-)

	You can find it on wuarchive but since it is in the /mirrors,
	it should also be on Simtel20. It's in the directory:

	/mirrors/msdos/pli	<- If I remember correctly...


	With a nice C compiler and some knowledge on changing ms-dos
	calls to cp/m, I'm sure someone out there could do wonders!

	Take care.

OK, I have a clone of the Microsoft CP/M card; no extra memory, uses DMA to
access the system memory, and uses a Mostek Z80.  I am running CP/M 2.2 on a 
64K Apple II+ (heavily upgraded).

My Rana Elite II drive (360K; 40 track, two sided) came with a .com file that
when executed patched the cpm56.com file for sysgenning the new system.  Fine,
no problem, until I tried to upgrade to ZCPR.  The version of ZCPR that I
found uses a submit batch file (and DDT) to patch the cpm56.com file.  The
problem is that both patches are not compatible as written, one will clobber
the other (regardless of which one is applied first).

Further more, I keep toying with the idea of adding a hard drive, but if I
can't properly integrate my Rana drive into ZCPR myself, there is no hope of
adding a hard drive for use by CP/M (most add-on drives for the Apple seem to
be strictly Prodos supported these days).

There must be documentation somewhere on the contents of the system image that
cpm56.com contains and loads onto the disk when you do a sysgen and how to 
patch cpm56.com to make changes!

Any help that anyone can give would be most appreciated!

Subject: Re: C-128 CP/M screen I/O
Message-ID: <1991Sep26.152912.5682@bronze.ucs.indiana.edu>

Using the public domain CONF command to set the RS-232 baud rate to a very
low value helps a great deal. (Of course, when you use a terminal program,
it's reset to something reasonable). CP/M's lowest baud rate setting is
50bps, but at that rate it drops keystrokes. Two settings that provide
adequate key scanning while improving performance markedly are "conf
baud=110" and "conf baud=75,feel=0". I'm not sure exactly what "feel" does
but the lower the (non-negative) value, the better the keyboard's response.

It would be interesting to see some kind of comparative benchmark of these
2 settings. Based on a subjective and unscientific test (scrolling in VDE),
the 110bps setting seemed slightly faster, contrary to What Should Happen
(tm). (or what intuition would suggest.)

If memory serves, "feel" indicates how often an interrupt checks the keyboard.
A feel of 0 means to check the keyboard every time; a feel of 1 means to check
the keyboard every other time (skip 1), and so forth.  Baud says how many
times the interrupt occurs.

Actually, Curt, what you see as CPM56.COM is just standard notation for a 
56K sysgen image of your system. Had it been sysgened for 58K and then 
saved as a disk file (instead of placed on the system tracks), it would 
be usual to name the file CPM58.COM. The point is that as a sysgen file, 
there is no source for it.

What you need is the source of the BIOS for your Apple II (or is it 
Apple //e?). What kind of CP/M card have you got in the machine?

 Try the following:
  pip a:[GX]=c:*.*[GY]
 Watch the brackets... This will copy from area Y on drive c to area X on 
drive a.  
  Note that [GX] is not needed if you want it to goto A0...
