As some of you probably already know there is a major design flaw in
Turbo PASCAL. Namely, THEY USE THE COMMAND LINE TO STORE DATA INTO!
For those of you have tried to use the CP/M command tail with the
statement 
VAR CmdLine : String[127] absolute $80;
Will probably notice that if your command line is more often than
not completely munged when you try to read it. I have found that
if the VERY FIRST thing your program does is copy the command line
into a string variable with the loop
FOR I := 1 to Mem[$80] do Cmdline[I] := Chr(Mem[$80+I]);
CmdLine[0] := Mem[$80];
The most you can get seems to be around 37 characters of the original
command tail. The rest is corrupted(sp?) by Turbo's init procedure.

  There is a solution however, or rather a hack, that will allow one
the full use of the command tail. The procedure is as follows :

  o Put the following code in the program at or before the point where
    you will use the command line : 

    Const 
      Start_Address = $1FC9; { Declare the value from your system }
    Var 
      I       : Integer;
      CmdLine : String[127]

    For I := 1 to Mem[Start_Address] Do 
      Cmdline[I] := Chr(Mem[Start_Address+I]);
    CmdLine[0] := Chr(Mem[Start_Address]);

  o Go into the Options menu, and set the mode to Com file. (Doesn't
    make sense to have command line recognition when you are running
    the code from memory.)

  o Then set the start address from what it currently is to start_
    address + 80h bytes. In my system the start address went from 
    1FC9h to 2049h.

  o "Q"uit the options menu and compile the program. When completed
    the list of memory used should come up with 128 bytes free at the
    beginning of your program.

  o Now use DDT or SID or ZSID on the resultant .COM file. Note the
    length of the file (so you can save it again later) and dump
    at address 100H. There will be a jump at 100 to the start address
    you adjusted above. After that will be a copyright message from
    Borland, and some zeros until about address 170h. Do the following
    commands in the debugger :
    A>ZSID FOO.COM
    ZSID .........
    xxyy HHHH HHHH     <- The hex number xx is the number of pages you 
    #a100                 need to save.
    100 jp 130
    103
    #a130
    130 ld hl,80
    133 ld de,1fc9
    136 ld bc,80
    139 ldir
    13B jp "start_Address"  ; use the address that the jump at 100 originally
    13E                     ; pointed to.
    #G0
    A>Save zz FOO.COM  <- convert xx to decimal and use in place of zz.

You now have a .COM file, that will first save the command tail before
Turbo has a chance to Stomp on it. Argh! Why couldn't they design it
correctly in the first place!

Well, I did it.

With surprisingly little effort I've replaced the one of the SSDD drives on my 
horizon with two DSDD 96-tpi TEAC FD55F's - from 163k per drive to 784k per 
drive in one evening.  Total cost $283.70.  (2 x $135 for the drives + $8.70 
shipping + $5.00 for one 34-pin edge connector from Radio Shack.)  I even 
managed to add in the archive BDOS patch, ZCPR2 with BIOS inits, and Plouffe's 
2k block mods for the octal drives.

I've written up exactly what I did in a message to NorthStar-Users and will 
forward a copy to any that ask (it's some 24k long).  If response is good 
enough (<4 requests) I'll also post directly to INFO-CPM.  It should end up in 
the <cpm.nstar> directory at simtel20 eventually.

I have been having trouble installing ZCPR2 on my Xerox, specifically 
with modifying the BIOS the take care of the various buffers, etc.
Does anyone have ZCPR2 running on the Xerox, and if so could I get a
copy of your BIOS or suggestions on buffer assignment.

Thanks,

	You may want to try and get some old issues of the 99'er
magazine.  You ask WHY?  Because the TI 99/4a used TI's 76498a
sound chip which worked *similarly* to the GI AY3-8910/2.  Obviously
the values will be different but it's the general scheme (timings and
frequencies) of how the sounds are produced that will allow you to
re-create them on the different sound chip and maybe learn how to
create your own.  Also, several years ago Steve Ciarcia had a column
(in BYTE, naturally) devoted to the GI sound maker and you may be able
to use some of his examples.  Nonetheless, please let me know of any
libraries or further examples you may come across.  Thanks,

 You can get Microshell from

    1800 MIchael Faraday Drive, Suite 206
    Reston, Virginia, 22090
    (703) 471-5598

 I would also check Microtools, and MicroTree. I just bought MicroTree from
 them (ls, cd, pwd, tree, mv, cp, rm, mkdir, rmdir) and it works very well
 (it maps user areas to dnamed directories). I run all three programs under
  MPM-816, but I have also used Microshell and Microtools under CP/M-80, and
  CP/M-816.
 Note that they do not support Microshell under MPM , some things do not work
 well in this environment ( no line editor for example, and script files
 which cross user and drive boundaries don't work well).

   I have taken the big step from 8 to 16 bits with my recent order of
a Z-150. What I don't want to do is give up my dual DDDS 8" drives. The
local Heath folks don't admit to being able to interface 8" drives, which
I take as simple nonsense. Can someone point me to a solution. With all
those IBM systems out there, shurly someone has an 8" controller.

Last year, I bought a military surplus Intertec SuperBrain for use as an
intelligent terminal.  However, it is far more versatile than that, which
has led me to want to attach some outher devices to it.  There used to exist
a beast known as a SuperBrain S-100 bus adaptor.  This fits onto the
internal 40-pin Z-80 bus connector, and provides an S-100 bus interface.

My question: Does anyone know where I could pick up the S-100 bus adaptor?
Alternately, how hard would it be to interface devices directly to the
40-pin connector?

Please keep in mind that I am a hardware cretin who writes device drivers
for a living (strange but true).  This would be essentially a "first
project" as far as the hardware is concerned, but supporting software is not
a problem.

The pin connections to the internal Z/80 bus are shown below:
