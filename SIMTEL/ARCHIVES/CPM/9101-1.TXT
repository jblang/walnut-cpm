The only way you'll get this out is by using a programming language
that can read binary files - you'll then get garbage beyond the 'real'
terminating ^Z; or use DDT to change the 'wrong' ^Z to something
innocuous.

Tom Albrecht was looking for a mailing list program.  If he is using the
Z-System, then he should try Joe Mortenson's ZDB (Z DataBase), a small
database program for just this purpose that is currently under active
development.  I have not used it myself, but it gets excellent reviews from
callers at my Z-Node.  It has probably been posted to the Z areas on
SIMTEL20.

Well, I can't remember where I downloaded it, but I have something called
'Small tex' by Mike Meyer (no relation!) circa 1982. I never actually set
it up, but according to its users manual, it does share lots of stuff with
Knuth's Tex. However, rather than using metafonts it apparently uses
Fancy Font(tm) from SoftCraft for output.

This information is offered merely as proof that such a thing does exist.

Subject: TeX under CP/M ???

Ben Wildasin asked for it.

Ben, I am addicted to TeX and no less to CP/M.
But TeX under CP/M, I wouldn't try to turn the dream into reality.

TeX was originally written in WEB, with the WEB interpreter (TANGLE)
producing PASCAL source code. The TeX program relies on enumerated
variables in the range 0..32767? Do you know a CP/M compiler handling
that?

A converter WEB-to-C was then developped, that makes porting much easier.
Today you can get the source for TeX in C. All implementations known to
me under MSDOS starting from the C code use an internal virtual memory
management because the 640k addressing space is not large enough. Even
if such a management would be ported to CP/M, I do not see how the
memory swapping and overlayed code and work areas could be packed in
60k of memory left on a banked system. It could be a challenge, but not
something practical.

DVI drivers, you ask.
One could think of TeXing the document on some other machine, downloading
the intermediary DVI file to a CP/M machine, and using the CP/M system
to display the output. A Previewer is probably feasible under CP/M as what
you need is a bit map of the screen (in some graphics mode, not all CP/M
system has such a feature). And to print, but probably you would want to
print on a cheap Epson-like device: there again memory bitmaps are
required, and with the much higher resolution again the driver will
essentially exercise the hard disk, and the user will be frustrated.
It already takes FIVE MINUTES if not more to print one page of TeX output
on an Epson printer with a 10 MHz 8086 processor!!!!

I know only one reasonable way to TeXing under CP/M. Purchase one of those
cheap PC-clones, with 640k RAM and at least 20 Mb hard disk, and a graphics
card, and declare it to yourself and friends as a co-processor to the CP/M
machine. As a SLAVE, the idea of keeping a PC is perhaps tolerable....

If however you NEED TeX the right machine to purchase is OF COURSE not
the PC junk. What you want is an AMIGA. TeX on an Amiga outperforms just
about anything existing except powerful workstations. Speed is not the main
issue. With the Amiga you see the output and the input on the same screen
side by side, without printing, and the turnaround to prepare a document
is minimized.

Too bad, it ain't CP/M....                        Jacques

I second that. Don't even think of it. I just finished a tangle (sorry
for pun) with getting TeX running on a Tandy 6000 (68k based Xenix
machine) with 1 M memory and tens of Mb of disk. My major problems:

Needed flexnames cpp (got free version).
Needed long identifiers (used shortc and cpp).
Bug in compiler for large multi-d arrays.

And the sheer amount of time needed to compile and test.

I would say the minimum configuration that will support TeX comfortably
is 1 M memory, 20 Mb disk, flexnames C compiler with 32 integer type.
Below this you'll need ugly tricks.

So go buy yourself a cheap PC clone instead.

Oh, if there are any t6k readers, I'll announce the diffs in the Tandy
newsgroup soon.

I received a letter from Chris McEwen the other day, announcing that he was
taking over Art Carlson's job as editor of The Computer Journal.  He didn't
get into the details, and I'd let my subscription lapse after issue #47.
There was a file, either on Jay Sage's Z-Node or BCS's ZI/TEL BBS
explaining what happened, but I failed to obtain a copy.  Does anyone have
more information?  Chris McEwen alluded to health problems that finally
forced Art Carlson to step down.

Personally, the Z-System bias of the magazine made it less attractive for
me, since I'm still struggling with a CP/M 1.3 clone (Cromemco CDOS),
leaving me out of the running for a Z-System.  The hardware articles were
disappointing, too.  Of course, *now* Chris McEwen announces that they've 
done an article on building a SCSI interface, and it's the in issue I just 
missed.  <Sigh>.

Greetings. I got the K10 working. Here's how (maybe someone else got a
non-working one too)

If you take the case off and face the HD controller board, try to
locate all the mounting screws for the PCB. There should be 4. Now,
look at the top-left one (nearest the face panel on top) and take it
out (with a screwdriver). The problem with my K10 was that, after
years of vibrations, the HD controller shifted so much as to make a
resistors lead touch the grounding screw. That's why, early on, it's a
just a "flakey" HD drive and only later (after many angry HITS on the
right side ;-) does it fail completely...

Well, all I did was put a small plastic washer on that mounting screw,
formatted the drive, and let it run all night. No problems yet!
[wheeeeee]

Now for the question (no, not related). I would like to know more
about the TurboROM. I took out the old 10MB drive and put in a 40 MB
28 ms. I UNDERSTAND that the most I can get is a speed improvement,
but I want MORE :-) A person I know put in 2 10MB drives and just put
a switch on the front panel so he can switch them in and out ! :-)
Viola, 20MB! [grin]

Take care.

Subject: TeX under CP/M and ``TeX clones''.

I did not know that there exists or has existed anything like a stripped
down TeX or something resembling TeX.

IF IT EXISTS, KEEP YOUR HANDS AWAY.

Because TeX is TeX only if it is TeX. This is not a joke. One of the most
important FACTS about TeX, explaining at least in part its popularity in the
academic community, is that THE SAME INPUT FILE PRODUCES IDENTICALLY THE
SAME DOCUMENT ON ANY OUTPUT DEVICE USING ANY COMPUTER.

If you use ``something like'', you will start up happy to use your CP/M
machine with it. Then you will want MORE, BETTER QUALITY with a laser printer
for example. You will transfer the input to another machine, and IT WON'T WORK.
Unless you care for guaranteed frustration, DO NOT START.           Jacques

Subject: Trouble Installing ZSDOS on a Xerox 820-II
Message-ID: <" 3-Jan-91  8:48:00 EST".*.Michael_D._Sprague.wbst311@Xerox.com>

Has anyone ever installed ZSDOS (by Plu*Perfect) on a Xerox 820-II?  Can it be
done?  I have had one heck of a time trying!!!  Bridger gave me the phone
number for one of the authors, but before I go bothering anyone at their home,
I thought I would first check here.

When I tried using INSTALOS in the normal way.  I got an error message saying
"Bit relocatable table not found" (or something like that).  The error, when
checked in the manual, said that something was probably non-standard, and
suggested trying MOVCPM to create a file, and use INSTALOS with the /A option.

So, I tried MOVCPM * *.  I kept getting the message SYNCRONIZATION ERROR, and
the computer locked up, forcing me to push the reset button.  I finally
reformatted the disk I was trying to put ZSDOS on, and SYSGEN'ed it from my
Master System Disk.  I did NOT run CONFIGUR like I normally would.  Once the
needed CP/M and ZSDOS files were copied over, I ran MOVCPM * * again.

This time, MOVECPM worked.  It would have defaulted to a filename of CPM60.SYS,
but I named it SYSTEM.MDL so I could use the default in INSTALOS.  At that
point, I ran INSTALOS /A, and used SYSTEM.MDL.  It seemed to work this time,
though it came up with the following.

	CCP   0000H
	BDOS  0800H
	BIOS  1600H

Not exactly what I was expecting for a 60K system!!!  Not being happy with
this, I continued on anyway, and replaced the DOS using ZSSYS.ZRL.  I then
SYSGENED the disk using the resulting MDL file.  As expected, the computer
locked up when I tried to boot it.

I really don't know what to do next.  Any suggestions?

Carol, I have a Kaypro 10 with the Advent Turbo Rom, and also the clock 
they used to sell, and I ADDED a 56 meg drive.  The original one in it 
was a 10 meg 1/2 high, and it was a fairly simple matter to add another 
1/2 high drive.  Took a new control cable with an extra connector, a 
second data cable, a Y for the power cable to split off power to 2 
drives, and the ROM and Formatter Advent used to sell.  You would have 50 
megs if you left your original drive in. 
 
There is a minor speed improvement with the Turbo Rom.  
 
I hear that since Bridger Mitchell wrote the Rom and Formatter 
originally, he is selling them now.  Can someone else verify this? 
 
Good luck, and I will be glad to help if needed.

In fact Word Master gave me no advise about the ^Z, it just refused to

I ended up using BASIC to edit the file as a random access file.

1) Who created/produced/sells MP/M? I'd like to get a packet (once I
   get out of this broke-ness spell) and play with. While you're at
   it, any comments?

2) Could anyone tell me a phone number for Digital Research or whoever
   it is that sells CP/M for them now? DR's 800 number disappeared.

Thnx!

I have recently acquired dbaseII for the osborne 1 and don't know
how to use it on my kaypro 2x.  When I put the disk in it says it
can't read my diskette.  Any ideas on how to convert these osborne
disks to kaypro so I can use them?

   Chris is taking over not only as editor but as publisher.  The complete
text from an announcement file on my Z-Node is attached below.  If our
community is to retain this tremendously valuable resource (all the others
have folded or defected), we must have new subscribers and contributors
coming on board.  Please give the magazine a try.

   I don't think Jim really expects TCJ to cover CP/M-1.3!!  With such an old
version of CP/M, Jim in not likely to find much applicable material in TCJ or
anywhere else.  While the CP/M coverage in TCJ is largely concerned with Z-
System (after all, that is where by far most of the action is in CP/M
programming), TCJ covers much more than just Z-System.  We are especially
looking toward expanding the coverage of embedded controllers and local area
networks.  The next issue will probably include articles on both (assuming I
finish mine describing the controller I built to run my home's heating and
electrical system).

>> The hardware articles were disappointing, too.

   What was wrong with them, and what would you like to see?  More specific
comments would be more helpful.  The management is very much open to
suggestions!

   If that is the article I am thinking of, it described a way to attach a
Bernouilli box to a CP/M computer.  If I could find a surplus Bernouilli box,
as the author did, I'd love to try that out.

   Here is the set of news releases about changes at TCJ.  Please note that I
have no financial stake in TCJ (unless you count losing money by underwriting
the cost of new subscriptions placed with Sage Microsystems East).  I am
strongly committed to keeping this last true hobbyist magazine alive. 
Besides writing my own columns, I also solicit and edit submissions from
other authors.

                                 NEWS RELEASE

Art Carlson, editor and publisher of The Computer Journal (TCJ) has announced
his retirement. Chris McEwen is named as the new editor and publisher. Art
cites health as his reason for the change. "The past few years have been a
struggle due to my personal health," Art writes. "It is time to get help. I
spent a lot of time thinking about the type of person who could continue TCJ
from its present base, and expand it without ruining what we have worked so
hard to achieve. It had to be someone interested in our areas of computing."

Chris states that no changes in format or editorial policies are anticipated.
"The traditional strengths of TCJ as a technical journal--its quality
articles and reader involvement--will continue. We look forward to building
on the solid foundation that Art gave us."

The Computer Journal publishes technical papers relating to micro computers,
embedded controllers and operating systems. "Upcoming articles include use of
ground as a surge sink for power line protection and assembly language
programming for the high level language programmer," the new editor reports.
TCJ also provides thorough coverage of the CP/M and Z-System operating
systems. The journal, published six times per year, is expected to expand
soon from its current 40 to 48 pages. Chris explains, "Our most recent issue
went to press with just two column inches uncommitted. We have a growing
backlog of good articles awaiting space."

The new address for TCJ is: The Computer Journal, PO Box 12, South
Plainfield, New Jersey 07080.

FREE TRIAL SUBSCRIPTIONS

A subscription policy change is announced concurrent with the news release of
Art Carlson's retirement from the position as editor and publisher of The
Computer Journal. Previously, TCJ was available only through prepaid
subscriptions. This required readers to pay prior to seeing their first issue
of the journal.

Effective immediately, subscriptions will be accepted without pre-payment.
New subscribers will be given an opportunity to review their first issue
before being asked to pay. Should you feel that TCJ is not for you, simply
mark the invoice "Canceled" and return to us.

Alternately, and for a limited time only, prepaid subscriptions will be given
a discount of $2 per year for US subscribers or $3 per year for foreign
subscribers. This offer is valid for both new subscriptions and renewals, but
expires on 31 May 1991.

What do you get when you subscribe to The Computer Journal? TCJ stands as the
sole remaining general circulation magazine providing full support for CP/M,
Z-System and 8-bit operating systems. Articles written by such Z-System
notables as Jay Sage, Carson Wilson, and Bridger Mitchell appear regularly.
Use of Z-System and its tools are discussed in depth. But we don't stop with
that. Articles include advanced programming techniques, such as using
logarithms to speed mathematical calculations. Interfacing devices on micro
computers is covered, as a recent article on building an RS-422 interface
showed. And real world solutions to real world problems are given: The
March/April issue will have a paper describing the dangers of MOVs and using
the ground line to dissipate surges in power line conditioners.

If you are a CP/M or Z-System user, or if you are an advanced user of any
micro computer system, you should take a look at TCJ. Send us your name and
address and let us send you the latest issue.

Wanted: No slot clock for Kaypro 10.

I am interested in buying a no slot clock for my Kaypro 10. It is one of the
earlier models without the timer or internal modem. Does anyone know of a
company that still sells a no slot clock for a Z80 machine? It would be great

Mike Sprague described his travails with getting ZSDOS installed on his Xerox
computer.

   That shows that the system you were running at the time was not one
created by that version of MOVCPM, which checks the DOS serial number in the
first six bytes of code.  Digital Research punishes one for trying to use a
'borrowed' MOVCPM by locking up the system.

>>      BIOS  1600H

   This may or may not be a problem.  I don't remember what those values are
supposed to be.  I'd recommend that you look at that image file and see where
the CCP, DOS, and BIOS appear.  Normal SYSGEN images have them at 980H,
1180H, and 1F80H, respectively.

   I would also suggest that you make up a new boot disk based on the system
generated by MOVCPM and make sure it works.  Then go back to the ZSDOS
installation.

   Chris McEwen at Z-Node #32 runs this stuff, I'm quite sure, on Xerox 16/8
computers.  If it will work there, it should work on your simpler machine. 
Also, I seem to recall that the clock module menu includes something for the
Xerox 820 (though I may be mistaken).  Good luck.

Yes and no.  

No, WordStar for the Osborne 1 did not come configured for memory mapped
video - I don't know why - it's orders of magnitude faster than going through
a jillion layers of software.

Yes, you could set the underline attribute by or'ing with 0x80.

Actually, WordStar on the Osborne 1 didn't come configured for any
of the features of the machine; it was just shipped as plain vanilla,
as far as I could ever tell. For example, the arrow keys on the machine
were set up to deliver CP/M codes, and you had to do a messy setup
operation to switch back and forth between those and the codes that
WordStar expected.

I found it much easier to use after I dug into the customisation
info, and set the screen help delays etc to what I thought were
sensible values. I also found and published a patch for the arrow keys
problem, but that's a longer story ...

   there is a program for the kaypro called mfdisk, which is supposed to
allow you to set one of your disk drives to the osborne format, as well
as format a disk in that format.  while i have not tried it myself,
i would guess that it works.
 
   there is a selection in that utility that is supposed to let you
read/ write, and format an ibm pc disk, but i haven't been able to get
that to work.  would it be safe to assume that only works for cp/m 86
and not msdos??   (msdos has a very different directory structure than
cp/m.  perhaps it works with msdos 1.xx or so...)

With my Kaypro-2 came a program which enabled it to read Osborne
disks. If the only problem is the disk format that should solve it.
I suppose you can get it from another Kaypro owner, as it came bundled
with your machine and you have some sort of right to it.
If, however, dbaseII needs to be customized for use on a particular
CP/M machine, it will not be that easy, I am afraid :-( (I simply do
not know)

Hmmmm, seems strange that DR would try to keep you from using MOVCPM, when it
*seems* to be standard utility on a CP/M System Disk.  Odd!

I'm not sure if that was the case here, however.  My normal System/Boot disk
was created using the original System/Boot disk.  Using my normal System/Boot
disk, I had formatted, sysgen'ed, and configured the disk on which I was trying
to put ZSDOS.  MOVCPM is not on my normal System/Boot disk, because it's
something I never use (normally).  I grabbed MOVCPM for the ZSDOS disk from the
original system/boot disk.  (And yes, I do have a backup of the original system
disk  :-)

Does this then mean that only a disk formatted and sysgened by the original
System/Boot disk can be used by MOVCPM?  Or does this mean that the version of
MOVCPM supplied with my System/Boot disk is useless with that disk?

I was wondering if the problem was in that I had configured the system.  Xerox
supplied a utility called CONFIGUR which allows you to set the defaults upon
booting.  Things like the floppy drive step rate (the default 30mS is a tad
slow), options for the serial ports, 7 or 8 bit keyboard, and things like that.
I usually run it when I sysgen a disk, to set a faster floppy step rate,
changed the printer to 9600 baud, and the keyboard to 8 bits.

Chuckle it's the same machine, not a simpler one.  A 16/8 is nothing more than
an 820-II with the 16/8 board (8086 CPU w/128K RAM) installed!!  The software
is slightly different, in that you get CP/M, CP/M-80 and CP/M-86.  CP/M-80
itself might be more complex than CP/M, in that it is meant for concurrent
operation with the 16/8's CP/M-86.  Even so, when you boot the machine, your
booting CP/M, not CP/M-80.

The TurboROM is now being marketed and supported by Sage Microsystems East.
Contact Jay Sage, uucp address sage@LL.MIT.EDU.
 
TurboROM (or another ROM upgrade) is required on a K-10 in order to access
more than one hd of 10MB. TurboROM allows a total of 2 hard drives of up to
56MB each (simultaneously, no switches!).  In addition, it provides a
type-ahead keyboard buffer, a built in screen dump, cursor configuration,
built in screen blanking after 10 minutes of nonuse, onscreen time display
if you have a built in clock (some K-10's do), auto-detection of a variety
of floppy disk formats (many more using Plu*Perfect's MULTICOPY), support
for time/date stamping of files (requires Plu*Perfect DateStamper), and last
and possibly not least, support for up to 4 floppy drives.  I guess that
about sums it up.  I hope it's OK to post this.  I don't make any money off
of TurboROM, but use one in my personal K-10 and also in my BBS K-10.  I'm
happy to see that Jay has picked up the ball on this one.

Your problem is a relatively simple one but requires the right tool, in 
this case any one of several will do.  A public domain program called 
SZAP is available on many BBS's around which is a "binary" file editor, 
which is to say that it doesn't recognize ^Z as an EOF marker and allows 
you to change bytes anywhere in the file.  An other utility which will do
the job is a disk editor.  Two of them DU (many versions around) and SODU 
(which is screen oriented and must be taylored for individual terminals) are
fairly common.  These programs allow you to edit disks by track and sector 
or by group, which is the logical data unit referenced in the CP/M 
directory

The easiest solution, if the file is small, is to use DDT, or any other
debugger, load the file into memory (it must all fit), change the offending
^Z to whatever, quit DDT and SAVE the appropriate number of pages to the
filename of your choice.

I believe that BDS C is now being supported by Sage Microsystems East, and
has been upgraded to be fully compatable with ZCPR3.  Mail to Jay sSage can be

I thought it might be helpful for readers to see how the mix of articles 
evolved over 1990.  This exercise has convinced me that TCJ may, both by
moving forward and stepping back, become something of great value to us
humble CP/M folk.  I'll talk to Jay tonight, and probably resume by

Thanks for the number for Znode 45.  You might have noticed when you 
uploaded ZMP15 that the RCPM there is using RZMP16 for Zmodem u/d loads.  
This is a serious upgrade of ZMP15 which makes use of BYE rather than 
terminal overlays.  The .LBR is available there as RZMP16.LBR.  Thanks again
to Ron Murray.

Message-ID: <3832@eastapps.East.Sun.COM>

I recently aquired at auction some Zenith PCs that I believe are CP/M
machines, but I'm not sure. They are all-in-one boxes with a 12" green
monitor, two (what look like 360K) diskette drives, a keyboard and several
I/O ports on the back. Typing the "help" key at boot time displays a
diagnostic menu. I did not receive any OS with these and would really
appreciate hearing from anyone who knows what they are and/or has the
OS for them (will pay all costs). The model number on the back is:
ZFG121-32 if that means anything to you. 

Thanks for taking the time to read this! Any insight appreciated!

Well, there are a couple of programs around that can handle this.
I use Media Master by Spectre Technologies (22458 Ventura Blvd.,
Suite E, Woodland Hills, CA 91364; phone 818-716-1655).  Uniform is
another program that should be able to do the trick -- I think you
can get it from FOG.  And, a more circuitous route would be to use
a shareware package like 22NICE which permits IBM-compatibles to
emulate an Osborne or Kaypro disk drive (I've used it to move
SuperCalc files from my old Ozzy to my new 386 machine).

I have said this before (tired of hearing it??), but be very careful
about software like MediaMaster before putting big bucks into it.  I
was fooled by their documentation and impressive list of "formats
handled".  It (apparently) works fine with a format like Kaypro's
DSDD, that is quite common.  I can tell you, from personal experience,
that it will NOT read these Ozzy diskettes, if they are single density,
on a vanilla PC clone unless you have a specialized controller/drives.
It has problems with single density diskettes (early Osbournes used SD).
There are other formats that they advertise, that will not work (Cromemco
DSDD is a notable example).  Try before you buy.  Of course the same is
true for Uniform and 22NICE, but I have not had the opportunity to try
them.

Please don't respond with "I have it and love it.  It works with xxxx"
etc.  I'm glad that you like it, but if you're thinking about buying
it for reading some format that you commonly use, and you have no
direct knowledge that it works with that format -- proceed with
caution!!  Flames to /dev/null.

You should have the utility MFDISK.COM with your 2X which will permit reading
the Osborne disk.

Subject: CP/M & MBASIC question
Message-ID: <77348@unix.cis.pitt.edu>

	Greetings I have a Kaypro 10 and am starting to experiment
	with CP/M. (My first z80 machine)

	I have several questions:

	1) Is there a command in Miscrosoft BASIC (M-80) that will
	clear the screen and home the cursor? I have all docs but they
	say nothing.

	2) I have a simple CLS.COM program that is about 15 bytes long
	that clears the screen. Now, I DUMPed it and converted the
	hex to decimal and poked those values from within BASIC.
	When I CALL it, it clears the screen and does a "Warm Boot"
	[bummer]. Anyways, I got rid of the JMP 0000h (for the
	warm boot) but now in hangs. [bummer^2] Arghh... Good lord,
	even my Apple ][+ has a HOME command! ;-)

	3) How do I load a binary file so I can use it with the
	USR# function? I have an assembler (RMAC), a linker, a
	BASICLIB.REL (what is that <--- ?), and MBASIC. Is this
	all I need? Oh, yeah, I have a hard disk so space in not
	a problem.

	(I have the source for SAFETY.COM, which also clears the screen,
	but even that does not work when POKEed from BASIC. Can I use
	&HD000? I have no idea where empty space is in BASIC.)

	Anyone?

	I also don't have a text editor (WS died) so I wrote my own
	in basic.... can't use the "," with INPUT... it gives a
	"Redo from start" (or something similar).

	4) Anyone know how to read a text file using random-access?
	I tried every possible combination. I can create but I can't
	read it. (Remember, you can't read a file that contains ","s
	with the INPUT# statement)

	Maybe I should stick to assembly..... [grin]
	(Yeah, but you need an editor for that - Catch 22???)

	Take care.

	P.S. Please e-mail. I will archive everything. Before sending
	a "send everything to me", give me a few days to organize :-)

   the memory mapped video on the osborne is somewhat strangely laid out,
and micropro never bothered to adapt the memory mapped version of wordstar.

   but soon pd text editors began showing up for the ozzy, such as vdo and
its successor, vde.  for a machine like a stock osborne, thay are actually
much better than wordstar.
 
   download them from a bbs near you.  vde ended at 2.66 (eric meyer still
does work on his PC version of vde, which is (INHO) the best text editor
available for msdos machines.  (it even runs on a dec rainbow))  but is
very stable and has no major bugs.

   MOVCPM is a standard program that comes with CP/M, but it contains the
licensed software for that machine: the CCP, the serialized BDOS, and the
manufacturer's (or DRI's) proprietary BIOS.  It is not a utility that can be
moved from system to system; it is the basic operating system generation
program.

   SYSGEN, on the other hand, is a more-or-less universal utility.  It
extracts the operating system from the system tracks on a diskette and/or
writes it to a new diskette.  It does not generate a new system; it only
copies it.  It may be used with MOVCPM to put the system created by MOVCPM
onto the system tracks of a diskette for booting.

   If you got a synchronization error report when you ran MOVCPM, then the
operating system that you were running at the time was not one that was
created by that copy of MOVCPM.  Specifically, the BDOS in use either was not
the Digital Research BDOS (perhaps you has installed something else) or had a
different serial number.  People have published, by the way, the simple patch
for defeating the serial number check.

   CONFIGUR probably just changes values a specific locations in the BIOS
code, and this should have no effect on the operation of MOVCPM or the
installation of ZSDOS.

   Yes, but I would call a machine without the extra board and the software
complications required to deal with it a "simpler" one.  Even more reason to
contact Chris McEwen if you are still having trouble after generating a
clean, new system disk.

To be fair, most MOVCPM`s incorporate at least minimal BIOS type code
to boot the system, so for a general user to use a different version
of MOVCPM than the one intended for the system would be pointless and
confusing to diagnose. Obviously this doesn't apply to hackers, who find
their own workarounds.

No, there is no such command in MBASIC to do that.  The  reason is that
most CP/M computer manufacturers failed to get together on ways to do
obvious things like screen handling, so they are (nearly) all different.

Yes, that is certainly a bummer all right.  The easy thing to do with a
Kaypro is simply:

	PRINT CHR$(26);

All Kaypros that I know of treat a control-z sent to the screen as
meaning clear the screen and home the cursor.

I like VDE as a text editor.  It is fast and relatively stable. 
Different people will have different preferences, but for an "in-memory"
text editor, I find VDE to be about the fastest and least buggy one
around.  It works well on Kaypros.  Its only problem shows up when you
need to edit a file larger than about 35KB.  Then you need the virtual
memory functionality of something like WS or Perfect Writer (an attempt
at an EMACS clone).

There is probably someone there in Pittsburgh (I assume from your
address) who can supply you with numerous PD programs, including
editors.  If not, send me email and I may be able to help.

The 100-4 is a double side 96-tpi drive.  From the common dash number, I would
assume that the 65-4 is also 96-tpi.  Look for an upper head to see if it is
double sided.

This is a hint given in the documentation, but in my case, it didn't help.
I tried lots of different combinations, without success.  I guess I have
no problem with these programs; they are *VERY* useful *IF* they work.
My problem is that the vendor makes expansive claims about the formats
that they can process, and the warning to potential users is that these
claims *CAN* be untrue.  Be careful!!  Particularly if the format you are
interested in reading is single-density and/or not-so-common.

Even worse, in the case of MediaMaster, phone calls to the vendor for
help were treated as a nuisance.  Then you are really stuck.

Again, the bulk of these comments are directed toward the MediaMaster
product.  I have little experience with Uniform or 22Disk.

Try this:

PRINT CHR$(26) : REM Clear screen
PRINT CHR$(27);"=";CHR$(X+31);CHR$(Y+31) : REM move cursor

CP/M machines work the way God intended (they have terminals instead of
standard hardware that everyone has to know about), so it was not possible
for Microsoft to put those commands in.

I might have the coordinate order backwards, and +31 means that the upper
left hand corner is (1,1). If you want it to be (0,0), add 32 instead.

If you have the manuals, you should look up how to call a machine language
routine; it's been long enough since I played with BASIC at that level (I've
discovered the magic of assemblers now) that I don't remember. At the very
least you have to replace the JMP 0000h with a RET (opcode C9H). If you just
delete the JMP, you'll wind up wandering through memory; I usually trash a
disk when that happens, so I tend to be careful.

I used to hand poke them, but I have done things like read a binary image
into a string and use that to construct a source statement on disk. Getting
machine code into BASIC is not easy.

BASICLIB.REL is the run-time library for a BASIC compiler, e.g., BASCOM,
which compiles Microsoft BASIC. I seem to recall that its library was called
BASLIB, though.

The traditional way to do this is store the code in a string variable and 
use VARPTR to find the address of the variable; if you've got manuals you
can figure out how to do that. I seem to recall that VARPTR( A$ ) is the
length of A$ and then VARPTR( A$ ) + 1 contains the low-order byte of the
data area and VARPTR( A$ ) + 2 contains the high-order byte. But it's been
a while.

I've worked with both MediaMaster and Uniform, though not with a large
number of off-the-wall systems.  However, I have noticed that I usually
must format the transfer diskette with MM or Uniform before copying the
data onto the disk.  When formatted by the target machine, MM & Uniform
often can't read it.  When formatted with MM or Uniform, usually both
can read and write the diskette.

Hope it helps...

You Bet!!  The C Users Group has released a diskette of cross assmebler
sources that includes one for the Z80 written by Will Colley (sp??)
called "AZ80" (I think).  I run it on an MS-DOS machine, and find it
quite nice.  I believe it was also posted to comp.binaries.ibm.pc *VERY*
recently.  It is written in C, so I see no reason why an enterprising
Sun-ite couldn't port it to UNIX (or most any place that has a decent
C compiler.)

I may be dreaming, but I thought I would ask anyway...

Does a Z-80/8080 emulator exist that runs under Unix, preferably
that can boot CP/M, using files to emulate the floppies?

Failing that any cross-assemblers or compilers that will run under
Unix and generate binaries that will run under CP/M?

Reasons why you make ask?

1. to run old software, thus really eliminating the need to keep old
   equipment around.

-- OR --

2. to be able to find some use for said dust gathering old machines.


Anyone find any interesting uses for old machines (other than the
obvious planter/doorstop etc.?   (I.E. device (BSR or otherwise)
controller, serial mux, printer switch, etc?)

(I'm new to this group so forgive me if this has been asked before...)

VDE is still supported by Carson Wilson as ZDE (for ZCPR3).  Check his

Subject: Using BYE as a relocatable RSX
Message-ID: <1F8RV1w163w@austex>

I recently upgraded by BBS from Z33 to Z34 with NZCOM.  I read with 
interest Chris McEwen's article in TCJ #42 on using BYE with NZCOM, however
I found the job to be not as formidable as advirtised.  NZCOM is easy to
configure and BYE is a bear, but once tamed and properly configured, it
coexists with NZCOM with no apparent problems.  I did not encounter any 
of the bugs which Chris reported.  I suspect that his maxdrive and maxuser
quirk was an artifact of QBBS.  HBBS, which is written in assembler had the
same problem - maxdrive was set one drive lower than it should have been.
The bug was easily killed.  
 
I would like to know if anyone has tried rewriting BYE to run as a
relocatable RSX under Z34.  Z34, NZCOM and JetLDR allow dynamic reloction
of files by two different mechanisms.  A "type 4" COM file contains a PRL
style relocation bitmap and an elegant relocation header (thanks, Bridger!)
which places the working image of the file in high memory just below the
CCP.  JetLDR has the capability as well of placing an RSX at the memory
location of your choice using a CFG file interface.  The RSX is in a .REL
format and JetLDR is capable of handling all the hooks via multiple common
declarations in the RXS relocatable module.
 
I'm probably going to jump into this one and try it myself at some point,
however if anyone has done this before I'd like to take advantage of 
his or her (hopefully successful) experience.

Thanks again Jay, and others, for the info.

If my MOVCPM and operating system do not match, then I am afraid they will
NEVER match.  However, I still think it might have had something to do with
CONFIGUR.  I kept getting the synchronization error until I formatted a floppy
with the master, sysgened it BUT did not configure it.  Formatting, sysgening
and configuring it, even using the master, resulted in a synchronization error.

Anyone know the patch for defeating the serial number check for MOVCPM?  I may
need it here.

What I meant to say is that CP/M is CP/M is CP/M.  Unless you start using the
16/8 board, with concurrent CP/M-80 and CP/M-86, there is NO difference between
running CP/M on a 16/8 or the 820-II.  Even so, I suspect the changes for ZSDOS
might be no different for CP/M-80, than for CP/M, assuming it could even be
installed.  CP/M-80 is NOT sysgened onto the boot tracks of the bootable floppy
(nor is CP/M-86).  Normal CP/M is what gets installed.  You have to run an
application (I don't remember what it is off the top of my head) to shift from
CP/M to CP/M-80.  Thus, I suspect you can't even install ZSDOS on the 16/8's
CP/M-80.

I may not be exactly correct here, as it's been a while since I messed with a
16/8 board.  It seems that there is so little software for CP/M-86, that it's
really not worth my time.

This does not mean, however, that I will not contact Chris McEwen.  Is there a
way I can contact him, besides the Z-nodes?  Someday I'm gonna hook a modem to
one of my computers ... someday.  :-)

     The Disk 2 is a two board set.  If you don't have both boards,
you can't use it.

     CompuPro's Disk 2 is a SA-1000 ( ie. 8" ) HD interface.  Specs
basically read like those for the Disk 3, except for the interface
(DMA across 64k boundaries, intelligent controller, etc. )

     It's no longer supported, but CompuPro will still answer
questions about it.  The manual is still available from them, too.
Give tech. support a call.

Does anyone know anything about this board (Compupro Disk 2 cntrl)?  
I believe it is a hard disk controller to SA-4000 <?>.  Is SA-4000 compatible
with ST-506?

The clear screen command for the Kaypro 10 is ^Z, aka 1b hex, aka CHR$(26)
in Basic, I think.  Any way you can send this to the screen will work.

You have to change the JMP 0 to a RET (C9 hex).  This will return 
program control to the CCP rather than to the BIOS warm boot.

Subject: cpm emulators under unix
Message-ID: <3813@mentor.cc.purdue.edu>

I'm using a cp/m emulator for unix that I got from the U. Of Tokyo 
ftp site a year or so ago. It does 8080 only, and is not complete
emulation of all flags. In particular Wordstar does not run. 
For some reason, WS uses JPO in a way that depends on a very
good emulation ( this is jump on odd parity). The implementor of
my version tried to just always save the last arithmetic result
and then recreate the flags when needed. This should work for 
reasonable code, but obviously fails for code like
     lxi h, arbitrary_word
     push  h
     pop   psw
Anyway, the version I have runs CP/M, MAC, M80, L80, MBASIC, etc,
so I haven't made the ultimate effort to track down the last ergs
fr the emulation.
  You can try out the look and feel of CP/M-80 by rlogging into
"cpm@hopf.math.purdue.edu". This is readonly system, so about all
you do without getting kicked off is run SD, MBASIC, etc.

Help

--- a friend has managed to obtain a SANYO MBC1000 system which
is apparently a CP/M machine, but he doesn't have any software for
it, and more specifically, a systems disk.

I'm assuming that this contains the utilities necessary to format
disks and generally fire up the machine.

If you would be prepared to send us a copy of such a disk (I know
this sounds a bit vague, but then I've never used CP/M :-), let me
know how we might go about easing the transfer.

Normally I'd use UUENCODE and PKZIP, but have no idea on how to get
the info from a PC to a CP/M disk.

Thanks

Mine needs a little work but it is running code.  It also has a
built in debugger which is handy.  That is the part that needs the most
work right now.  The debugger is a compile time option because it
is slooooooooow with it in.  I haven't compiled it under anything but
my 386 system so I can't guarantee plug and play but it is mainly
ANSI so should work on ANSI compilers.  I use GNU C.

I'll post it to alt.sources.  Comments are greatly appreciated.  I
thought there was a mailing list for discussing this.  It seemed
like everyone was writing a CP/M emulator at one point and someone
started a mailing list to swap code and ideas.  I remember joining
the list but I can't remember who was running it and I haven't seen
anything.  Anyone know if this is still happening?

Aztec C, MAC, HEX and a bunch of others work on mine.  One thing
needed is a test suite.  My idea is to run instructions and jump
to zero on error.  A debugger can then watch to see where the jump
occurs since the error immediately stops the system.  Of course it
is important to test the test and jump instructions rather early.

That's why I built in a debugger.  It helps debug the processor itself.

Mine isn't too bad.  I emulate CP/M rather than loading a real copy.
It helps speed things up.  An interesting side effect of the method
I use is that the TPA can stretch from 0100 to fffe, 258 bytes short
of the entire 64k, as long as the high 1 or 2 k is only used for
stack or data.  Programs that do standard checking for top of TPA
still have up to fec0 where the BDOS seems to sit.

	My guess is that what you have are what is known as Heath/Zenith
89 computers.  Two five inch drives are mounted vert. to the right of the
screen.  There should be a fan mounted in the top-right-rear of the case.
This is a 2 MHZ computer but can be modified to run at 4.

This machine was built/designed by Heathkit.  Heathkit  was purchased by 
Zenith which started calling Heath's computers 'Zenith Data Systems.'

These computers ran both CPM and HDOS (Heath-DOS).  The problem you
now face is to determine what type of disk drives you have.  Heath
used one hard sector format and at least two soft sectored formats.

Our BBS uses a Kenmore Ztime-I Calendar/Clock in our Kaypro 10.  It was, I
understand, widely used a few years ago as a Kaypro add-on clock.  The 
company is Kenmore Computer Technologies, 71 Argonne Drive, Kenmore, NY
14217.  Phone (716) 877-0617.  I don't know if they are still in business.

There is a program called Uniform from Micro Solutions, Inc. (Lord knows
if they're still in business) which is commercial and an excellent 
disk format xlater for CP/M machines.  You must have the version written
for your machine.  It will both copy and format to a large variety of other
CP/M disk formats.  You can also find a friend with a MS-DOS machine and 
use an excellent DOS program called 22DISK (v 12 is current) to read and
write CP/M formats via a DOS machine.  We have 22DISK and MFDISK available
on the Kaypro Club of Austin BBS here.  I'm not sure if they are up, but
if you look and don't find them, leave a msg and they can be posted.

Bummer....I have that volume, but haven't had much time to do anything
with it.  I was thinking of CUG #276 which is a bunch of cross compilers
written by Will Colley (sp??).  The Z80 version, called "az80", has
complete sources.  I compiled it with Turbo C on an XT clone, and it
seems to work very well.  It is very similar to M80, which I have gotten
used to thru the years.  I would think that a reasonably talented
person could port it to, say Sun, without a great hassle.  Have not
tried it however.  If you're out there Will Colley --- thanks for a
nice piece of software!!!

Probably, the best way is for the parties on both ends to get a copy of
Sydex' TeleDisk (v2.04 or later).  This shareware program permits making
a file of the original disk and creating a clone of the disk from the file
on the other end.  It is very powerful and utilitarian software!

If you are able to get a copy of the MBC-1000 disk, I'd sure appreciate a
copy also!

   I use these clock daughter boards in a number of my computers and have
always been very happy with them.  Their one shortcoming is that they do not
keep track of the year.  There are some extra registers, and there is a
common convention for storing the year in one of those registers.  Then one
just has to remember every January 1 to update the year value.

   I do not know what the status of Kenmore Computer Technologies is.  They
moved at one point, and we lost track of them for a while.  In any case,
Chris McEwen, sysop of Z-Node 32, is a source for these units.  He even
offers, I believe, a discounted price.  Contact him at

   On another note, Lindsay mentioned Uniform.  The company that makes it,
Micro Solutions, Inc., is definitely still in business.  Their Uniform for

The move cursor sequence, while correct, is unnecessary since the act
of clearing the screen with CHR$(26) leaves the cursor in the home 
position as well as clearing any video attributes which may have been set.

Greetings. 

I was given a computer that I have no docs on. It consists of a
keyboard, S100 card-cage, and power supply. It came with 2 8" drives.
The computer is made by the "ProcessorTechnology" and is called "SoI
Terminal Computer" Model # 20.

I has several slots on the back: Parallel, Serial, Casette interface.
There is also a card that controls the 2 8" drives with its own ribbon
cable.

I have a box of disks for it: CP/M-CDOS (FIG-FORTH) V1.2 8080 & Z80
(FORTH READABLE), MICROSOFT BASIC V5.03, UTILITY PROGRAMS, 48K WORK
DISK, FORTH SCREENS, 8080 FORTH, FOTH Z-80 CP/M (INCLUDING FLOATING
POINT), WORD PROCESSING, some more cryptic-labeled disks.

The card-cage has these cards: 2708 module (personality module), Disk
Jockey 2D/B (2D mod B) Rev 3, 16K static RAM (MM16K14) by The Memory
Merchant, 32K static RAM by Industrial Micro Systems.

Anyone have/had/remember one of these? It says that it is (C) by
ProcessorTechnology in 1976....so I guess it's been a while.

What I want is some info about how to boot it from the floppy drive(s)
and what some of the DIP switches do. Anything...

Take care.

P.S. By the way, what is a "Tandy Model 16"? Interesting?
Someone is selling them for $25, broken... Just wandering...

You can use PIP to primitive file splitting and concantenation.  When I 
ran into this difficulty with a textfile I TYPE'd the file to the console 
and waited until what I thought was half of it had scrolled by, then did 
control-S and picked out what I hoped was a unique sequence of bytes 
 
The I did PIP <newfile>=<oldfile>[Q<uniquestring>^Z]
      and
          PIP <newfile2>=<oldfile>[S<uniquestring>^Z]

This can be undone by
          PIP <bigfile>=<oldfile>,<oldfile2>

Message-ID: <4314@mentor.cc.purdue.edu>

I believe that the 8meg limit is set in the coding of
the BDOS, and inforced in the BIOS in the sense that
certain scratch ram in the BIOS data area has a preset
size.
   I think several replacement BDOS clones, e.g.
DOSPLUS, offer larger maximum logical disk size.
   There would be some perfomance penalties for
using larger sizes, namely more directory entries
to check or larger logical block sizes.

South Plainfield is in the part of New Jersey that moved to area code 908,

Well, I'm a little late in reporting, but here's what I found out:

Kenmore Technologies is still in business, and is still producing the clock.
Their price is $99.95.  Chris is buying bare boards from them (he could
simply copy the board design but he's "not in the business of ripping off
people's intellectual property"), and populating the boards himself.  He's
offering the finished product for $79.95, including shipping.

The board plugs into the Z-80's socket, and then the Z-80 plugs into the
board.  For machines which lacke the clearance above the CPU socket for the
addtional board, there is a version that connects with a ribbon cable,
allowing the board to be sited elsewhere.  One needs to be careful of how
the cable is routed, avoiding RF noise from switching power supplies, etc
(the only failed installation Chris ever heard of was with an Altos whose
switcher drove the CPU nuts).  The device (a National 58167) appears at I/O
address 0xE0 (0E0h for you old-timers :-), and can be moved to a different
address with trace cuts and jumpers.

Checks should be written to Chris McEwen, and sent to him at:

	P.O. Box 12
	South Plainfield, NJ 07080-0012
	908-755-6186

The above phone number is covered by an answering machine, whereas the one
Jay gave earlier may not be.  You're more likely to reach Chris directly in
the evening, by the way.  Around 8pm seems to work.

> Where did/does the 8 meg limit on logical disk size in CP/M come from?

It has to do with the fact that CP/M uses a 16 bit logical block pointer,
Since CP/M also uses 128 byte logical sectors (sector blocking/deblocking
routines change the physical sector size on the disk but the logical sector
size remains at 128), the maximum logical disk size is:

        65536 * 128 = 8192K

My Molecular Series 9 system has drive B set up as an 8 meg drive.
Doing a STAT B:DSK: yields the following:

            B: Drive Characteristics
        65536: 128 Byte Record Capacity
         8192: Kilobyte Drive  Capacity

It seems to me like RLB's reply is a good explanation of why
the maximum size of file would be 8 megs, if we can access
sectors of the file by a 16 bit integer. Why does it dictate
the max. logical size of the disk, however?

  NOte that this restriction is removed in CPM3 and MPM2.  The file
size restriction is limited by the 16 bit record pointer in MPM2
(I haven't combed the CPM3 manuals that closely), but the logical
device size is limited by the cluster size.  Device size is 
expressed in terms of the number of clusters, so the maximum
device is 32767*16384 (or 65535*16384) as the largest allocation
cluster is 16K bytes.
  When you get these large devices, however, MPM2 signifigantly slows
down when doing any directory operations as it scans the (potentially)
large directory.  A little work with caching the directory can make
a world of difference...

I apologize if this if one of the frequently asked questions but I just
got a CPM emulator from the Amiga and was wondering where I could FTP
some CPM software and if in fact that software would run.  The software
emulates the 8080 with H19 Terminal Emulation.

What I really need is a good public domain assembler for a class I am
taking.  I would also be interested in taking a look at stuff like
Mbasic and other software as well.

   The Sol was a relatively popular S-100 based computer made for
several years - the first really good Trek game I ever saw ran on one.
Processor Technology was located in Emeryville at first, experienced
tremendous growth, moved to enormous quarters in Pleasanton and then
quickly went bust. Too bad, too; the Sol was neat 'coz it was essentially
what people wanted in an Imsai 8080 but sized to fit on a desk.

  Yeah, these were 16 bit Radio Shack computers, based on the 68000
chip, and they ran Xenix and some mutation of TRS-DOS, as I recall, circa 1983.

  What a trip down sentimental lane. Afterall, I learned assmebly

Does the Kaypro have any 28 pin EPROM sockets? If so one
could use the Dallas Semiconductor "SMART WATCH". You just
slip it between the EPROM and the old socket. The usual
price seems to be about $40, but I sometimes see it for
$25. It does need some software, because it's not the usual
read a RAM address or port.

   well, not really.   it is limited by the directory structure that is at 
the heart of all cp/m disk operations.  cp/m only allows for a maximum of
65536 128 byte blocks.  that is the maximum size of a file, or a whole
disk.
 
   there is a built in mechanism in cp/m to allow the creation of 
partitions on a single physical disk.
 
    dosplus is essentially a different operating system than cp/m,
and it allows a larger total disk space through a somewhat revamped
directory structure.
 
   zcpr3 and zsystem do it through other techniques.

Not really a follow up article, but another question of the same class.

I just purchased a computer at an auction - couldn't pass it up - a nice
S-100 box with two boards, one a "pickles and trout" looks like a video
board ???  And the other (the one I am hoping someone may have info on,
or even a BOOT DISK!!!! ??)  is a Intercontinental Micro Systems Corp.
single board computer.  This little rascal has a Z80A, 9519 interrupt ctlr,
1793 FDC, Z80A SIO/0, 64K of ram, DMA chip and more!!  Wow!  this looks 
like one of the neatest little Z80 CP/M boards I have yet to see.

However, I have no manuals or software -- can anyone help?

Message-ID: <00943348CC8AFDE0.00000618@dcs.simpact.com>

I'm not sure there is a maximum *volume* size.  The maximum file size
is 8MB, or 0xfff (largest available number) x 128 (sector size) bytes.
A larger file couldn't be accessed randomly, since you'd run out of
sector numbers.  

I don't know if there's any reason you can't have a volume bigger than
the largest possible file, but if you do the maths you may find, given
a reasonable allocation block size, that you run out of space in, say,
the disk map around the maximum file size.

Good luck - Will

Subject: Need Description of Disk Parameter Block
Message-ID: <62314@bbn.BBN.COM>

I'm in the process of getting UNARC16 working on my Cromemco under CDOS.
Since CDOS provides only CP/M 1.3 calls, it complains when UNARC16 does a
call to the CP/M 2.x function 0x1F.  

For those who don't have their function tables handy (add another Post-It
note to your favorite email/readnews terminal :-), 0x1F is Get Disk
Parameters Block, which is used to get a pointer in order to query and
(possibly) alter aspects of the disk via this DPB.  This function is used
mostly by file compression and disk directory programs like Super
Directory.

What I need to know is the format of a DPB.  Armed with that knowledge, I
can patch UNARC16 to request the same information from with appropriate
(non-CP/M 1.3) CDOS call.  It only uses one entry from the DPB, so I'm sure
it's just looking for the block size.

By the way, Waite & Lafore's _Soul_Of_CP/M_ has been no help in this
regard.  They acknowledge the existence of function 0x1F, but say nothing
more about it or DPB's.  So much for getting to the "soul" of CP/M.  What
they *do* cover they explain pretty well, but it's annoying what they leave
out.

Subject: Z80 Emulator
Message-ID: <R6cBw1w163w@austex>

Discussion on this newsgroup of Z80 emultors brings me to a question to
which I've been looking for an answer for some time.  Is there an MS-DOS
based Z80 emulator out there which does a >>full<< emulation of the CP/M 
BIOS, including disk functions.  I'm looking for an emulator with a monitor
debugger which will allow me to work effectively on CCP, BDOS and ZCPR3 
system components.  The emulators I've seen so far (which isn't very many)
allow running plain vanilla CP/M programs under a simulated BDOS and, as
in the case of Z80MU, don't really support disk functions.  Joan Riff and 
company don't seem to understand that a CP/M disk is just a doubly sub-
scripted array from the point of view of the BIOS, and any managing 
software need only be able to import and optionally export "files" from 
this data structure to and from true files in the MS-DOS environment, a
fairly simple job.  The BDOS file handling system is much more complex, 
but there are enough copies of the CP/M BDOS, ZRDOS, NovaDOS, ZSDOS, 
etc. around to handle the job if BIOS emulation is properly done, and a 
boot routine is provided to load some system software into the emulated
64K Z80 memory domain.  Such a system would provide maximum flexibility
in CP/M emulation.  Riff seems to have the attitude that anything other
than plain vanilla CP/M (e.g. ZCPR3) or stock MS-DOS (e.g. 4DOS) is a sin
against nature and the users of same should take their computers and go
straight to the Warm Place.  On top of that, newer versions of Z80MU are
severely overpriced (considering that they don't do a true CP/M BIOS 
emulation) at $150, for which price I can buy Borland's Turbo C++
Professional or similar package with loads of disks, documentation, 
examples, etc....

I don't want to get into the "RIFF" wars again. I think
Z80MU has a certain market that is happy to use it.
If you don't want the bells and whistles of the newer
versions, the last public domain version is still kicking
about.
   If you just want a RAW z80 emulation package that will
potentially run any z80 operating system, I haven't seen
any. Your best bet would be to get source to one of the
existing emulators, for example, the Heath User's group
emulator. 
   If speed is not an issue, there have been at least a
couple of emulators issued on usenet for z80's, written
in C. Complete z80 implementations may be hard to find,
because often people get tired of thinking about half parity
flags and DAA, etc.

	Nick Sayer's emulator (posted to alt.sources a while ago, and
written in reasonably portable (at least among larger machines) C)
*only* fakes the BIOS (there's a table of BIOS entry points that does
RST 38H for each, which is detected by the emulator - the emulator
looks at the address, and does the appropriate BIOS function.) The
BDOS is loaded in from an external file, but is a normal Z80 (or 8080)
BDOS. 
	The problem with this design is that it is *SLOW*. There are a
number of places where the BDOS copies sectors around - that loop is
emulated instruction by instruction, which takes a long time.

	Nick's emulator can certainly run anything with a BIOS; in
fact, if you disable the BIOS hooks and provide routines that do "the
right thing" with IN and OUT you can probably emulate *any* z80...
once I've got the time, I do intend to emulate the Radio Shack Model 4

	Nick's emulation is *very* careful, particularly due to my
banging on it as an alpha tester... I also double checked everything
against the Zilog Z80 manual for clarification of what the flags do.
Half carry is done "live" as are all the flags (there is an "F"
register, and everything tweaks it as it goes...) There isn't really
any support for the different IM 0..2 interrupt modes, but I suspect
that doesn't matter much for most uses - and that code would tend to
need customization based on the particular hardware being emulated
anyhow.

Message-ID: <CAA64FDA49FF003506@ucs.uwplatt.edu>

Hello,
 
I have found out a few more bits concerning the problem with the TRANSMIT
command in cp/m kermit V4.09:
 
1).  The every 128th character is being dropped, starting with the 1288th
     character.
 
2).  The transmit function is handled by the file CPSTT.ASM in kermit.
 
3).  The routines to handle the reading from the file into the big buffer
     are in the file CPSUTL.ASM
 
4).  The characters are read from the big buffer one at a time into a
     retransmit buffer, for retransmission of the current line if
     specified by console input.
 
5).  It seems that the 128th character is skipped when reading from the
     bug buffer into the line buffer.
 
 
Any kermit experts out there willing to lend a hand?

I think you are both correct, as I believe the board in question is a
CompuWatch by Compu-Time which does, I believe, have battery backup.  Look for
a little 'black-box' that says Data Sentry in the center right hand portion of
the board.  That is GE's 3.6vdc ni-cad package.

Subject: Fix for Kermit TRANSMIT command bug.
Message-ID: <CA65827C3CBF003620@ucs.uwplatt.edu>

Hello,
 
I have found the fix to the bug in with the TRANSMIT command in version 4.09 of
kermit.  The bug is in the file CPSUTL.ASM. The problem is that subroutine
INBUF: is pre-decrementing the byte count by 1, (decrementing an assembly
generated constant) causing the last character of each record to be ignored.
 
The line at fault was a few lines after label inbuf2: and read
 
        mvi     a,bufsiz-1      ; Number of bytes in buffer (pre-decremented)
 
this should be corrected to
 
        mvi     a,bufsiz        ; Number of bytes in buffer.
 
This bug only shows when files to be send via TRANSMIT are greater than 128
bytes.
 
 
The pausit: routine in the same file is also missing a return statement.
The cpsker.hex file does not seem to have this problem, but the source
file does not have the return listed in the (corrected) code fragment below:
 
        jz      pausi1          ; loop until a key has been pressed.
        ret
 
I hope this can help someone.

         Philip, have you ever run across a computer called a "ADWIN-80"? 
 

         It seems to be a single board Z-80 based system, 256K memory, 4 

         serial, 1 parallel printer, SCSI or SASI bus interface, WD2797 

         8/5/3" floppy controller, parallel keyboard interface and video 

         display circuit.  The person who owns it has no idea of where 
the 

         boot disk or anything else for it is.  I was thinking about 

         picking it up (the price is right -- free) but not sure if I 

         wanted to tie into another project such as you are having with 
the 

         Bullet.  Dismantling the ROMs just not something I want to get 

         into for the next few months. Especially not on a machine as 

         jammed as this one is.  Stuffed the entire board into a 5.25" 

         drive form factor.  No ASICS so some chips are mounted under 

         socketed LSI and all the other fun you can have cramming a board 


         to it's maximum.



         According to Richard, it was originally mounted into a terminal 

         and had one 5.25" floppy connected to it.  At some point, it was 


         removed from the terminal and kinda lost in a box.  Evidently 
his 

         brother who originally owned it is no longer into computers and 

         hence he is willing to give it to me (for some strange reason, 
he 

         thinks I might be willing to give it a good home).



 
Folks I copied the above message from a local BBS that David Bowerman 
runs.  He's a good fellow so if anyone has a lead then please respond.

You need FINDBAD. This works after formatting disks, and reads
sectors to find bad ones. The bad ones are collected in a file
stuffed in user number 15.
  Caution: Under CP/M a sector can belong to more than one
logical file. After using FINDBAD, any bad sectors will belong
to both the badsector file, and the previous owner. You can
use DU to discover this problem. If the file is data, you can
recover as much as possible by copying to a file of a different
name, and then erasing the previous copy.
  Check the SIMTEL20 site for FINDBAD. It's a simple idea and
works.

  well, it's like this - that same 16 bit integer that is used to address
sectors in a file is also used to address blocks in a disk.  therefore, 
the maximum available blocks on a disk is 65536, or 8192K bytes total.
   
  to access larger disks you would need a larger block pointer, something
on the order of 24 bits or 32 bits.  however, there is too much overhead
associated with maintaining two pointers, and large ones at that, in
an 8 bit system.   it is just easier to accept the 16 bit pointers and
work with them.

But the size of a disk block can be large, i.e. 1k, 4k even 16k.
Even 1k x 65535 = 64 megs.
  Of course it's hard to imagine doing a DIR to a disk with
64k 1k files.......

The following are several CP/M associated programs.  While only the last one
really fits you description, I included the others in case you might find
something useful.  I'm not sure if the conversion program actually has an
executable along with the source, but it should not be too much of a problem
to find someone to compile it if it's not.

Hope this helps.

Message-ID: <85300@unix.cis.pitt.edu>

	Greetings. I got some custom hard drives for peanuts. When
	I took them apart (a nice enclosure with a PS for 2 HH 
	Hard drives and a fan) I found:
	
	1 custom board (Anyone hear of 8800 buss?)
	  - Nothing interesting. It has one 50 pin connector and
	    out comes another 50 pin connector that hooks with (below)

	1 Xebec (FAB 10427 Rev 2 [(A)MLI-6] ASSY 104526) controller board
	  - This has a 50-pin input (will this work with my K10's
	    ribbon cable that connects the motherboard with the WD
	    controller?) Out comes a 34-pin drive control and 20-pin
	    data cables (ST-506)

	1 ST-406 Hard drive. Looks old - 1982ish... It's a FH 5 1/4".

	
	Now, I know that I can use the enclosure for any standard
	ST-506 drive (or 2 HH) but I want to know if I can perhaps
	connect this to any machine. Again, anyone know if the K10
	BIOS (CP/M 2.2F in general) supports Xebec controllers?
	It seems to have the same motherboard-controller cable.

	Take care.

	P.S. I asked several questions, here, about CP/M, MBASIC, and
	other stuff. Does anyone want me to summarize and post?

hi,

  Looking for CP/M for the C-128......
  I ordered it a while back and my check was cashed but the
  disk or anything else never came....
   Didn't remember to write down the address or name of the
  company I ordered it from either (just tore the order form
  out of the C-128 users manual, and that was that...)

 really need CP/M for the C128, if anyone can help please
 speak now.....

Subject: Found the Syncronization Error problem with MOVCPM
Message-ID: <"29-Jan-91 16:00:49 EST".*.Michael_D._Sprague.wbst311@Xerox.com>

If you remember, I was having trouble installing ZSDOS on a Xerox 820-II.  One
of the problems was in using MOVCPM to create an absolute file os the system.
I kept getting a SYNCRONIZATION ERROR.

Jay Sage explained that this was probably because the system was not created
using that version of MOVCPM.  I had trouble believing this, because I only
HAVE one system disk, and unless it was screwed up, which did not seem to be
the case, then MOVCPM and the system HAD to be the same.

Well Jay was right, but not in the way he had ment.  In playing around with it
some more, it seems ZSDOS's INSTALOS modifies MOVCPM or something like that.
Using the original master system disk, I formatted a new disk, sysgened it, and
then copied MOVCPM and the other files needed to install ZSDOS.  I then booted
the system using the new disk, and ran MOVCPM.  It worked fine, but I didn't do
anything else with it.  I then ran ZSDOS's INSTALOS in the normal way.  Note
that it uses MOVCPM.  As before, I got the "bit relocatable table not found"
error, so I decided to create an absolute file of the system.  MOVCPM gave me a
SYNCRONIZATION ERROR.  I deleted MOVCPM and then copied it over from the master
disk again.  It ran without a problem.

I tried this a couple more times, just to be sure.  If I ran INSTALOS in the
normal fashon, then I was NOT able to use MOVCPM anymore, until I deleted it,
and copied over a new version.

Strange!

I was thumbing through the new National Instruments catalog this afternoon.
Imagine my surprise at spotting boards for the S-100 bus.  They list a
DMA-capable IEEE-488 (GPIB) interface for $1295, and I/O port version for
$495, and drivers for either one in C for $300.  If any wealthy S-100 owners
are interested in this, their number is 800-IEEE-488 (that's 800-433-3488).
These products also appear in the 1989 edition of the catalog, by the way,
at the same prices.

Subject: need CP/M file transfer binary for generic machine
Message-ID: <9981@orca.wv.tek.com>

After ten years of Wordstar, my TRS-80 model II is fading away (one
drive gone, keyboard is flaky, display column 2 overlays column 1), and
I've bought a PC clone.  I need to get my files off the old 8-inch
disks.  To that end, I'm looking for a CP/M serial port file transfer
program.  The constraints:

  -- It must be for "generic" platforms: it has to restrict itself to
     BDOS and BIOS calls.  Going directly to the I/O ports won't work
     because the Pickles & Trout BIOS takes interrupts and snarfs input
     on those ports as soon as it arrives.

  -- It has to be in assembler or binary form -- I don't have a
     worthwhile C compiler.

Best of all would be a program that runs in server mode, so I don't
have to type two commands to transfer one file.

Any protocol is okay, I can match software on the PC clone to fit.

I tried a KERMIT.ASM with "gener" defined to TRUE, but the darn thing
tried to write out my Centronics port.  Looks like erroneous
manipulation of the IOBYTE.  I don't have enough machine left to debug
this version.

If I can get the software onto my VAX, I can get it onto my CP/M
system.  My VAX can FTP to much of the internet, but not to SIMTEL20
(sigh).

Any references would be greatly appreciated.
