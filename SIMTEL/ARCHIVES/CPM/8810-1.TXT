Subject: CP/M-Z80 on UNIX??

I would like to be able to run CP/M on a UNIX PC (68010 CPU).  Is there
an emulator available?  Is there some source code I could hack from a
CP/M-680x0 emulator for a non-UNIX system?

Thanks.

Subject: IMP control

I'm trying to use my little C-128 to connect to a mainframe via modem.
I'm using a 1670 modem and IMP for my communications.  The problem is
that the mainframe requires a break signal to wake up the port.  Is it
possible to do this with IMP?  I've done it using the vt100-128 program
provided on the disk that came with the modem but the program as a whole
sucks swamp water.

Much thanks in advance.

Subject: Looking for software: PL/M

I've recently stumbled across some old software written in PL/M, and
would like to be able to make some changes.  The target machine is a
Z-80 process control system (actually an amateur radio repeater control
system), the test system is an IMSAI 8080 S-100 system, and the software
development system will be a PClone or the IMSAI.  The ideal would be to 
find a complete package somewhere.  As far as I know, it is not 
available from DR any more...

[spritzensparken!]

I have had two Tandon TM-848-02 floppy drives fail recently.
(half height DSDD 8")
Both failed the same way.
They worked as double sided, then the upper head failed.
Now they cannot read nor write the upper side,
but function okay as single sided.

The heads look fine.
What went wrong?  Can I fix it easily and cheaply?
(Remember that new drives are $50 at computer fairs).

Thanks for your assistance.

Of course, just about anything is better than IDRIS, including CPM let
alone the after market stuff in PD as well as commercial stuff that has
been around for years.

Regarding UN*X like OSes for banked memory systems, there is also QPLUS
which is more of an OS than CPM, DOS, or ZCPR3.  Not well advertised,
though.  And the demo PD version is somewhat stripped down from the
commercial package.

But, then again, I am biased as I helped write a good chunk of it.

At the time (~1979), I beleive Whitesmiths was afraid of incurring
the wrath of AT&T.  Copyrights and such.  Perhaps they were overly
cautious, or perhaps it was a valid concern.  I don't know where
I heard this, but it wasn't from Whitesmiths, so take it with a grain
of salt.

This discussion has overlooked the motivation of Unix incompatibility
in Idris.  Plauger and associates were scared that AT&T lawyers would
shut them down under the trade secret laws because they had access to
Unix source code before they formed Whitesmiths.  The "galloping
incompatibility" was an attempt to demonstrate that Idris was not a
Unix rip-off.

This was back in the days when the same company that sold Unix would
hassle you about adding an unregistered extension phone, and the
lowest-cost Unix license was $20,000 (no cheap binaries).  I'd say
their concern was justified.

I have in my hands one port of XINU (as in Doug Comer) to the Z80; that
was written in C/80 CP/M C.  I have seen others.  The XINU port that I
have is a bare-bones kernel (no utilities).  It is a little odd to see
the results of ps -efl on an ADM-3a connected to an IMSAI, though.

The XINU port that I have was done by Ed Schramm, who lives near 
Norfolk, VA.  I can provide an address if needed.

I run Z80MU without an AUTOEXEC.Z80 file.  I believe that I ran it that

I am trying to get a copy of either 4.05 or 4.09 Kermit to run on a CPTxx
system running in data processing mode, and have come up on several problems
that I need assistance from a user on the network.

a.  In attempting to download the HEX files, I have hit a roadblock in getting
the files into the machine.  Would a user out there have a disk containing 
Kermit that I can barter for?  I have no formatted data processing disks at
present to use to resupply, but would be able to supply a DSDD 3.5 inch disk
as a replacement.

b.  Is there a format routine available for this machine that would format a 
disk to use standard DSDD 3.5 inch disks?

Any assistance would be appreciated

Sorry, couldn't get e-mail delivered.  This is really directed at the original
posting.

I have the pl/i program for cpm, complete with the manual.  Since I'm not using
cpm any more at all, I'd be glad to sell it.  Either send me e-mail (but please
be sure I can get back to you--I have only usenet and BITNET access) or snail

Subject: Operating System Command References

Hello.  I am need of some information for a school project that I am hoping
everyone may be able to help me with.  What I need to do is make a reference
chart as large as possible that covers various basic commands for the various
operating systems in existance. For example:

	Command Summary		UNIX		MS-DOS		TOPS-10

	display directory	ls -l		dir		dir
	copy a file		cp old new	copy old new	copy new old

What I need from Netland is the common commands for the various operating 
systems.  Such as XENIX, VMS, CP/M, AppleDos, BSD, Xenix, TRS/Ls Dos, etc.  
Just the basic commands.  This also will go into making "alias templates" for 
CSH and KSH for users on UNIX systems who would like to have a command set of 
their native machine. 

Here is a small list of commands that I would like for the chart. It is not all
of them, just the ones I can think of off hand.  I am using the UNIX equivalents
of each since UNIX is my native operating system.

	cat		cd/chdir	chmod		ln
	lpr		mkdir		more/less	mv
	rm		cp		ls		biff
	finger		who		mail/mailx	mesg
	write/chat	cal		calendar	date
	lock		pwd		uptime		man
	pr		cmp		diff		find
	grep		head/tail	sort		uniq
	wc		kill		ps		tee
	time

I know that some operating systems will not have some of these commands, like
MSDOS would not have 'who' or 'ps'.  Those will be represented by 'N/A' in the
chart.  I would also like to have the commands for entering both common line
and full screen editors, especially for the ones that come with the operating
system.  Not the editor commands, just the command to get into an editor.

After this project, and if it gets a good grade, my next project will probably
be along the same lines with the exception of making a chart for editors, both
full screen and line.

All information and help would be greatly appreciated.  Please mail all replies
so I can be sure to collect them all. And if you are interested in the "aliasing
templates", mail me and I will get them to you upon their completion.  If there
is enough interest in them, I may post them to the net.

Sorry about the cross posting but I wanted to get this to all the groups that
dealt with a different operating system.

Thanks for your help.

In a recent response to Apple's "Look and Feel" lawsuit, HP maintained
that the Mac's graphical interface is based on work done by other
companies - in particular, Xerox Corp.  HP's filing further alledged
that Apple obtained copyright registrations on the screen display
fraudulently by not disclosing to the U.S. Copyright Office that the
Mac's display was derived from Xerox's work.

This is an interesting turn of events.  If this is upheld by the court
it could invalidate the copyrights of all shareware and commercial
programs which contain a substantial amount of public domain code.

I wonder how that would affect the SEA vs. PKWare suit?

Would it make ZOO's copyright invalid?

How about all the copyrighted file transfer programs out there which
use the Ward Christensen protocol (popularly called XMODEM) and all
those YMODEM and ZMODEM programs based on Chuck Forsberg's PD code?

Subject: Looking For Z80 assembler Source

   I am looking for source in "C" for a Z80 assembler. I have a copy of a 
z80 macro assembler in "C", but I can't compile it on my machine because 
it uses yacc. I am using Aztec C on an Amiga.

Any suggestions would be appreciated (if anyone has the machine and a

NOTE: My company deals in IDRIS product for ATARI ST.

IDRIS for the Z80 is a very old product, and Whitesmiths probably would not
sell it to now.  IDRIS however runs on may different processors.  IDRIS 3.14
which I have on my ATARI MEGA-4 (mc68000), has WSL ANSI C compiler, X-Windows
and TCP/IP.

I have never seen or heard of QPLUS, if and when I do, and if it is good and
properly priced, I might buy it for my Oz-1.

    I read an article in UNIX World comparing system V and AIX. It clearly stated that System V did not have VM(Virtual Memory concept). Can someone clear the following doubts for me through e-mail to nataraj@happy.cc.utexas.edu


   (1) If there is no VM, how does the operating system, bring the programs from secondary storage to main for execution.(System V )

   (2) How does MS-Dos solve the above problem?
    
    (3) I have comments like Unix needs at least 4M of main memory?
      Is it for all the daemons to run?

Subject: CP/M+ <-> Apple DOS3.3 file transfer

Hello, net.wizards:

I own an old Apple II Plus, and have installed a "CP/M Card [TM]" from
Advanced Logic Systems.  The Card runs CP/M 3.0 in a banked memory
configuration.

What I am looking for is a way of converting files from CP/M format to
DOS 3.3 and vice-versa.  I have looked into CP/Muffin from A.P.P.L.E., but
it does not transfer files to CP/M format, and for some reason I have not
had much luck coaxing it to transfer file from CP/M to DOS either.

I would appreciate any leads you can give me.

Many thanks in advance,

Subject: CP/M+ BIOS

I own an old Apple II Plus system into which I have installed a "CP/M Card [TM]"
from Advanced Logic Systems.  The Card runs CP/M 3.0 in a banked memory
configuration.

My application is a disk conversion program which will move files to and from
CP/M and Apple DOS 3.3 formats.  It seems that making BIOS calls will not
work properly when accessing the disk, as most of the BIOS related to disk
activity reside in the bank opposite the application code.

I have tried setting my disk access parameters by calling the BIOS SELDISK,
SETTRACK, SETSECTOR, SETDMA, SELMEM, and SETBNK routines before calling READ.
The result is that this sequence of calls will in fact transfer the data into
my buffer if it happens to be in the area of memory that is shared between the
two banks (no surprise).

There are two reasons why I don't use the code that works:  First, SID is
loaded into the part of memory that is shared between banks, so my broken
program breaks worse under the debugger; second, my programming environment
(one of the C implementations) makes it hard to allocate my transfer buffer
in the shared memory area as that is where the stack resides.

Has anyone solved this problem?  Or does anyone have any suggestions for
anything I have left out?

Second, I see that the BDOS provides a "DIRECT BIOS CALLS" function which
takes as a parameter the address of some sort of parameter block which
presumably contains parameters that are loaded into registers before calling
the BIOS.  Does this facility overcome the bank dependence of the BIOS?
What is the format of this parameter block?

None of the literature I got with my Card has the information I need.  Neither
does the application note describing ALS' banked memory implementation, nor do
the other CP/M books I've bought over the years.

Any help you could give me would be much appreciated.

Many thanks in advance,

Subject: CP/M Emulator for 680x0

Does anyone have a lead on a program that will emulate CP/M-80 on a
UNIX-PC?  Actually, minimum requirements are a ZSID-like program that
runs on a UPC, that will let me debug Z80 binaries.  Does either exist?

People have recommended the code that was published in DDJ in early
1986.  I typed in about 1/2 page of code and the UPC assembler didn't
like it at all!  Is there an assembler directive to produce a listing file?

Thanks.

They run the same Z-System applications and tools.  Installation is
menu-driven and automatic; no assembly is required.  Documentation is

Z3PLUS is running on a good number of CP/M Plus machines, including
Amstrads, Osborne Executives, Morrow MD-11's, Visual 1050's, ...
NZ-COM is running on any number of CP/M 2.2 models.

Subject: a very naive Question???

The article is inaccurate.  System V has virtual memory of almost
any definition.  Originally System V had problems with virtual memory.
There are two differing definitions of Virtual Memory.

The more liberal definition says that Virtual Memory provides for swap
extension of real memory and some sort of address translation.  UNIX has
always done this.

The more restrictive definition is that some mechanism such as paging or
segmented swapping exists as well.

The difference is summarized in the following.  Suppose you have 1 M
of real memory and you want to run a 2 M process.  Prior to recent system
V versions, you were out of luck.  It always expected to load a whole
process as a unit.  On paging systems, it only needed to bring in the
parts needed for the execution of the current instruction.

The virtual memory argument was best summarized by Bruce Crabill of
the University of Maryland.  "It ain't virtual unless it's not all there."
This means that the liberal definition is kind of weak if you have to
have real memory to back your virtual memory for any give process.

-Ron

Of course, they may have meant VM as Virtual Machine.  It is doubtful
that anything other than AIX/370 is going to support that.

Subject: Turbo C

We have recently taken delivery of a used dual-drive Northstar Horizon.  This
unit has a Z80A and 64K of RAM.  The system is currently running CP/M version
2.23a, and has a copy of Turbo Pascal.  I prefer to program in C, and I have 
been wondering: 

	1. Did Borland ever offer Turbo C for CP/M?
	2. If so, is there any way of obtaining a copy, now?  
	3. Are there other C compilers available for this system?

Also, how concerned should we be about the supply of 10-sector diskettes?
So far, it sounds like 3M and Verbatim are still offering them.  The few 
distributors (all mail-order) who still accept orders for them have had 
none in stock; the risk of dead inventory is apparently too great.  Has 
this been other people's experience?  My project manager has been joking 
about punching our own holes with a straight pin.

My apologies to the members of the NORTHSTAR-USERS mailing list, who have 
already seen this posting; I wanted to reach as broad an applicable group
as possible.  Thank you.

1. That's Virtual Machine not Virtual Memory.  AIX uses VRM which is a sort
of low level idealized machine that comes between AIX and the true hardware.
It complicates life quite a bit when you want to add support for non
standard devices.  I think it's supposed to disapear in the future.

2. MS-Dos has neither.  It's a program loader that runs in 8086/8088
mode (< 1 Meg).  Yeah, it'll run on 80286/80386 machines, but it doesn't
take advantage of any of the extended features.

3.) Unix always needs one more meg than you have installed, either main
memory or secondary storage but usually both. ;-)

Are you serious?  It probably has its flaws, but the idea that every copy of
the OS has to be relinked every time any hardware is changes went out of
favor everywhere but here in Unix-land years ago.  I was of the opinion, last
I read anything of the AIX docs, that the VRM/dynamic drivers system was
AIX's most useful "enhancement".  (Even Messy-DOS is simpler and more
versatile at the same time than the Unices I have looked at recently (:-).

Actually, to repeat myself, user loadable drivers and the much maligned
"BIOS" create a reasonable virtual machine (virtual memory, . . . lets
talk about real computers now . . .).

     Wrong. The actual concept of virtual memory is the ability to allow
programs to use more memory than the machine physically has by swapping
the least recently used pages to secondary storage. For instance, if your
program wants to use 50 megabytes of memory and your machine only has
4 megabytes of main memory, you need store the excess on the disk until it
is needed again by the program. If your machine can do this, it has virtual
memory. This is usually (if not always) transparent to the program. Your
definition is only a part of today's virtual memory systems.

     Close, but not quite. Demand paging involves only the code portion of
the program. Instead of loading the whole program immediately when is is
executed, only the initially needed pages are loaded and new pages are
"paged in" as they are needed. This way, the program starts much faster.
What you have described here is actually the way virtual memory works. By
the way, I'm pretty sure you need a virtual memory system to be able to
implement demand paging.

>                    Anyway, even the "swapping" style of memory sharing
> uses Virtual Memory.

     Wrong. The definition swapping depends on what type of memory you
have (virtual or non-virtual). On non-virtual memory systems, swapping
occurs when a process needs to execute, but there isn't enough memory to
bring it in. Another process that is not currently executing is swapped
out (to secondary storage) to make room for the new process. Note that the
ENTIRE process is swapped out, not just pieces of it, as is true with a
virtual memory system.

     Swapping in a virtual memory system refers to the swapping of those
"chunks" or pages to and from secondary storage. Most people actually call
this "paging", since only pages of the process are swapped, rather than the
whole process. We say that a process is "swapped out" when all of its pages
have been placed on secondary storage. This usually only occurs on a heavily
loaded system.

     Again, this is the definition of virtual memory.

Lots of errors and inconsistencies in this discussion, mostly based on
terminology disagreement.

	"I read an article in UNIX World comparing system V and AIX. It
	clearly stated that System V did not have VM(Virtual Memory
	concept)."

As has been pointed out, the initials "VM" in the IBM mainframe world
stand for "virtual machine," a completely different animal from
"virtual memory."

		"The actual definition of Virtual Memory involves the
		concept of allowing programs to believe that they are

		address."

	"Wrong. The actual concept of virtual memory is the ability to
	allow programs to use more memory than the machine physically
	has by swapping the least recently used pages to secondary
	storage."

The term "virtual memory" has different definitions depending on who
you talk to and when you talk to them.  You can find texts that define
VM in both of the above ways.  The original poster was not "wrong."

	"Demand paging involves only the code portion of the program."

I've never heard this before.  In my (not trivial) experience, the term
"demand paging" always refers to dynamic paging of both instructions
and data.  I'd be interested in references to articles or books that
employ this restricted definition.

My CP/M Plus revision level for the CP/M Card [TM] is 3.01C2, about
3+1/2 years old.  It came with some Prodos utilities, but I don't
have Prodos.

The good folks at ALS sent me a copy of Mark Howard's application
note describing the APRD and APWRT calls.  The problem with this
method is that I have no documentation describing the Z-80/6502
interface, or any protocol for invoking RWTS (or anything else)
under the 6502.

It looks like this is what I need.  Unfortunately, its calling
sequence looks like one of the best kept secrets in the industry.
Every document I've seen that mentions it simply states that DEreg
passes a "BIOS PB [parameter block?] address" and that Areg 
returns with the "BIOS return."  Nowhere have I seen the field
offsets, sizes, and purposes of this BIOS PB thing; I am also
curious about how the SELDISK BIOS call return value is passed
back, as it's normally an address returned in HLreg.  The BDOS
function number for the direct BIOS calls is indeed 32H (or 50 in
decimal).

I've calculated the interleave translation, and I can even
calculate it at runtime by reading track $11 (assuming the VTOC
and directory are allocated the same way stock DOS 3.3 allocates
them, probably a bad assumption but it works for me).

As I mentioned in my previous posting, I have been able to coax the
BIOS to read DOS sectors into shared memory, but this involved
disassembling parts of the BIOS, and kludging in my own routines
which switch banks and call the BIOS.  The problems I've run into
are that so far I've only been able to copy sectors into/out of
shared memory, the subroutine I hooked into in the BIOS kept
moving as newer BIOS revisions came out (not a flame, just an
observation of a standard side-effect of software development), and
the discovery that SID is loaded into the top of memory (into shared
memory).

The ideal solution to my problem, I believe, would be an implementation
using the BDOS call we discussed.  A second solution would be to find
out where the BDOS keeps its transfer buffer in shared memory, and use
my hack to switch banks and call the BIOS myself.

I would appreciate any help that Gale (or anyone else knowledgeable
about this BDOS call) could give me.

Well, I called Borland International regarding Turbo C, and was informed that
they never offered it for CP/M.  Apparently they decided to drop CP/M before
they released Turbo C.  Strike 1.

I called Lifeboat Associates, which is now located in Tarrytown, NY.  Their
receptionist now answers the phone as "Magellan...".  Their software support 
person informed me that they discontinued CP/M support a while ago, but gave
me a number for a place called Software Resources.  Strike 2.

The woman at Software Resources acknowledged that they once supported CP/M,
but no longer do so.  Strike 3.

So, it looks like I've exhausted all potential commercial sources of a C
compiler.  Perhaps someone on the list is interested in selling their copy
of BDS C?  Are there any public domain compilers around?  I'm getting some
sense that there is a freeware compiler floating around the RCPM systems.

I received a message that a gentleman named John called me at work, regarding
the Northstar.  I guess this was in response to my earlier compiler inquiry.  
The number for the return call was in Connecticut and I've gotten no answer

I have examined the output of this program, and it is impressive.
"Crushing" consistently generates smaller files than either "Crunching"
or "Squashing".  And it does this without resorting to memory-hungry
brute force methods (such as LZW compression with 16-bit codes, as used
by the UNIX public domain COMPRESS program.)

  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Please consider this carefully, people!  Most of the recent discussion
pertaining to compressing archivers, such as ARC, PKPAK (nee PKARC),
ZOO, DWC, and now GSARC (to name just a few :-)), has related to the
issue of portability.  While that is understandably of great concern to
many USENET readers, it should not be overlooked that *compression
efficiency* is the primary reason for the existence and popularity of
these programs.

Some of us, who have actively researched LZW and other data compression
techniques, have known that further improvement of current methods is
technologically feasible.  I predict that this "Crushing" variation is
not even the ultimate we are likely to see in the near future.  Legal,
moral, and philosophical concerns aside, I urge continued support for
such advancements in the state of the art.

In this spirit, I have begun making the necessary modifications to my
CP/M archive extraction program, UNARC, to handle .ARC files generated
by GSARC10.  (Just as I did almost two years ago, when Phil Katz'
PKARC20 introduced an improved compression method to .ARC files.)

The internal RAMdisk is 32K.  If you plug in an outboard cartridge you
can have whatever is in that, typically 128K.  If you chose to run with
a 64K TPA (56K TPA) you have to use an external RAM cartridge as a RAMdisk

>So, it looks like I've exhausted all potential commercial sources of a C
>compiler...

I have 2 CP/M C compilers.   The first one I is QCX, the other is
Aztec C from MANX.

QCX is was an upgrade to a compiler called Q/C.  The upgrade was mostly
compatability and portability changes.  QCX is a reasonably full
featured compiler that is almost completely K&R compatable (lacks bit
fields and doubles, and any of the ANSI or SysIII extensions like void
and enum).  It's biggest advantage is that it comes with full source
code, not just for the libraries, but the compiler too!  It will compile
itself.

Looking at the source, it appears the person who wrote it was not a
compiler specialist, but it is well commented and maintainable.  Local
changes made here were to add voids, and unsigned characters as types
handled specially by the compiler (unsigned chars are not promoted to
ints in operations only involving other unsigned chars, since they can
fit in the accumulator and results in a major speed win).  The point of
that digression is you can fix up anything you want if you have the
source.

I ported it to UNIX to be able to do cross development for CP/M.  The
compiler output is Z80 assembler source, so if you want to do cross
development, you need a cross assembler (and possibly a linker).  When I
bought QCX several years ago, it cost less than $150.  Also, it was sold
with MS-DOS executables for cross support (I think that's what the X
stood for), Q/C was the native CP/M product.  BTW, on the cross support
front, The Code Works also sold (in source) a Z80 assembler/linker.  I
bought it, but unless it has been substantially enhanced, don't bother.
It probably works OK native on CP/M, but took *MAJOR* rework to build on
UNIX!  Repeat after me, "Pointers are not integers".

QCX was written by Jim Colvin at:
    Quality Computer Systems
    3394 East Stiles Avenue
    Camarillo, CA 93010

It was published by:
    The Code Works
    Box 62136
    Santa Barbara, CA 93160
    (805) 684-9534

This information is several years old, so you may have to hunt a bit
to find them. 

If you are not looking for something you can hack around with, but
just something you can run, the other compiler I use is Aztec C
release 1.06D from Manx Software Systems, Inc.  It is basically the
same C compiler they sell to the IBM PC world and the Apple MAC folks,
so it is quite full featured.  The difference is just in the code
generation portion, I'm led to believe.  They used to sell several
packages (called commercial, developers, etc.) that differed in
whether you got library source and some of the utilities; I'm a little
hazy about that.  The set I bought came with library source, compilers
for both Z80 and 8080 output (the big difference is the Z80 allows one
extra "register" specification), an assembler and linker (although
you can also use Microsoft M80 and L80 or Digital Research RMAC and
LINK if you like), a librarian and some other utilities.  The supplied
assembler/linker/librarian are quite good and faster than the
Microsoft and Digital Research counterparts because they are tailored
to deal with the compiler output (no macro's, for example).  They also
support overlays and there is an overlay manager supplied in source.
Since this is a port of the standard Aztec C, the library is quite
complete.  I regularly move programs from UNIX to CP/M with little
effort as long as the programs don't require impossible system
functions like fork(2).

Manx advertizes regularly in most of the computer magazines.  They
quit mentioning the CP/M version in the ads about a year ago, but when
I called and asked for it they were willing to sell it to me with the
caution "there will be no further development on this product, what
you get is what you get".  That was fine with me.  They wanted about
$250 for the whole enchilada (sources for libraries and all), I didn't
ask about other configurations and the price seemed somewhat
negotiable as they were just unloading inventory, I gathered.

Summary: Q/C and/or QCX; you get ALL the source, reasonably cheap
         Aztec C; more robust and full featured ("commercial", even!)

Of course, I am not affiliated with any of these people; they probably
don't even know I exist.  If you have any specific questions not
addressed in the lengthy ramblings above, send me e-mail at the
address below.  Don't give up!  C lives and works in the CP/M world.

When Borland says 'never offered', I get the feeling that the developed
but unoffered product is still lying about on a floppy marked 'can be
re-used' in Los Gatos somewhere:-)

Maybe you don't want it, but wasn't Mix C initially offerred under CP/M?
The only advertise their DOS version now.

I believe that a Small-C compiler is available at simtel-20.

Good luck.

Subject: CP/M C Compilers

Not so, Ralph.

Borland started out as Turbo-Pascal for CPM machines -- a product
looking for a company.  Since Philippe Kahn, at the time an illegal
alien, couldn't get anyone else to market T-P, he formed Borland
and started selling.  Migration to MS_DOS (and CPM-86) happened
later.  This dates back to '83 or so (I have a Turbo-Pascal compiler
with a 4 digit serial number to prove it), before MS-DOS was a real
market force.

Turbo-C didn't get to market until 85 or 86.  Indeed, Philippe, in 
a Dr Dobbs interview described C 'not as a language, but as a disease'
and indicated that they were getting into C rather reluctantly.
By this time, MS-DOS had pretty well taken over, so its rather doubtful
that a CPM Turbo-C copmpiler exists.

Incidentally, Modula-2 from Borland did go the way you suspicion.
Since M-2 was a natural extension for a house already selling
Pascal compilers, the CPM version did indeed grow.  But not an MS-DOS
version.  Because, probably, the market had moved on, Borland
declined to sell it themselves, but licensed it to Echelon.  My
guess is the decision might have been different if they had
an MS-DOS M2 compiler so they could support both OS's.  Sigh.

Apparently, no one has heard of Dynacomp!  I have their most recently
printed catalog, and it is full of software for cp/m computers(among others).
They will ship in many different formats, both 8" and 5 1/4" for a variety 
of machines.  

Yes, they do sell a "C" compiler, (C/80) made by a company called "Toolworks".
The price is $49.95 for 5 1/4" or $52.45 for 8".  The compiler seems
fairly complete, looking at the catalog description, though some seldomly used
language features are left out.

Also available from Dynacomp is a package called "C/NIX", to provide
a UNIX-like environment on CP/M computers.  This program adds the most
convenient features of UNIX, such as piping, hierarchical directories,
and search paths.  C/NIX costs $59.95 on 5 1/4" or 8".

They have a toll free phone number for placing orders:

1-800-828-6772

and their address:

Dynacomp, Inc.
DYNACOMP Office Building
178 Phillips Road
Webster, NY 14580


If anyone has used either C/NIX or C/80, could they please post their
opinions on the worth of these programs?

and therefore am unable to make any claims about the quality of 
their software.

Subject: Looking for info on SuperBrain QD computer

I recently acquired a computer called a SuperBrain QD made by Intertec Data
Systems.  It's got two DS 5 inch floppies, 2 Z80's, 64K of RAM, a display and
keyboard all in one nice (if large) package.  Unfortunately, I didn't get any
disks or documentation.  I assume it runs CP/M.  On power up, it
displays "3.1  Insert diskette in drive A:" and waits for a disk I don't have.
I tried a boot floppy from my old Kaypro 10 and it had read enough to cause
instant brain death.

Anyway, I wonder if anyone out there can tell me more about my latest computer.
I'd also appreciate any help you can provide in getting a copy of the operating
system.  I called the phone number on the back of the case and talked to a
little kid that had never heard of Intertec.  Are they still in business?

Email if possible as this is posted to a number of newsgroups and I 
doubt anyone besides myself wants to hear about this anyway.  Thanks.

  The below applies only to the Epson PX-8; I know nothing about the

  EPXMD3.COM is an adaptation of MDM740 for the PX-8.  It was
  adapted from the MDM740 source (Remember when source was almost
  always included with PD software?) for the PX-8 (Geneva).  Z80
  code was used in the adaptation -- none was used in the original
  MDM740 source; so the entire program was issued in source for the
  PX-8 as a .MAC file.

  Patch EPXMD3.COM location 0103h to 50h (ASCII P) to obtain pulse
  dialing; it should be 54h (ASCII T) for tone.

  There is a little known overlay for the PX-8 for the MDM7xx series
  existing.  If you have a MDM7xx program you are using, patch the
  .COM file at location 0105h as above.  (Note that MODEM7xx and
  MDM7xx are quite different animals.)

  There exists no PX-8 overlay for IMP2xx.  (I would very much like
  someone to make a liar of me in this statement.)

  There does exist a PX-8 overlay for MEX114.  The current version
  number of it is 1.2.

The Amstrad CP/M machines are named CPC 664, CPC 6128
resp. PCW 8256, PCW 8512, PCW 9512.
I think, you refer to one of those.

All of them have built-in diskette-drives for the rather
rare 3"-diskettes, so if this is the format which is needed,
you won't have much success with 3.5"-diskettes.

If the machine really has an external 3.5"-drive, many formats
are possible, even including the same as on the 3"-drive,
which is single-sided with 180K and would not use much of a
3.5"-diskette.

I would like to thank all the great people who responded in my hour of

the same machine I have.  Its nice to know that I am not completely

Subject: Morrow S-100 board

     Can anyone tell me anything about a board I just acquired?  It's
a Morrow Designs MULT/IO S-100 board.  It has:

        1) 3 8250's
        2) 1 8259 interrupt controller
        3) 2k of static RAM
        4) a funny connector that I was told is a parallel port, although
           I don't see how ( a 50-pinner... looks like an 8" drive port )

     I know the board supports extended addressing for the memory on
it, but beyond that I haven't experimented ( missing a 25LS2521 for
the port selection ).

     It sounds a *lot* like my CompuPro System Support 1, except of
course for the fact that the Morrow board doesn't include a clock.

     Does anyone use this beast?  I'd like to get it working... three
more serial ports would be VERY useful right now... as would a
Centronics port, if that's what this 50-pin connector is.

     Thanks.

I bought C/80 for my H-89 CP/M computer many, many moons ago.  Back then,
I couldn't afford anything else and @ $49, I thought C/80 was the greatest
thing since sliced bread.  I still feel that way.  I received updates for
longs and float/doubles later and some other stuff, so you can do serious
work with it.  For $49, it a an extremely stable and solid product.  Yes,
C/80 is missing a few things - bit fields and I can't remember what else,
but it produces fairly tight code and has a farily fast compile time.
Dr. Dobbs published an article featuring a peephole optimizer for Z80/8080
C compilers a few years ago and that optimizer is available in their C Chest.

I still write software for embedded controllers using the Z-80,
but not using C/80 unfortunately.  I still wish I could switch to it...

Subject: z80 replacements, S-100 single board computers

I am considering upgrading my S-100 Z-80 computer with a replacement
CPU board using either the Hitachi HD64180 or the Zilog Z280 so that
I can run my current CP/M programs. I have a couple of questions and
would appreciate any information anyone can share.

1) Are the Z280 and HD64180 trully object code compatible with the
Z-80 ?

2) In what ways are the Z280 and HD64180 different?

3) I would like to run a version of the Z system (ZCPR & ZRDOS)
that takes advantage of the larger address space of these chips.
Are there implementations available?

4) Does anyone have experience with particular boards that they
could comment on ?


The feature set that I am looking for is:

    - S-100 board.
    - at least 12Mhz CPU.
    - on board RAM, either static or dynamic but fast and rock solid.
    - 2 serial, one parallel port.
    - floppy disk controller for 8 inch drives minimum, with
        support for 5 1/4 desirable.
    - ROM firmware with monitor program and low level I/O drivers.
    - can access off board memory and peripherals using
        standard S-100 addressing.
    - supports S-100 multi-mastering and DMA transfers to on-board
        memory.
    - SCSI or hard disk controller - optional, but nice
    - clock/calendar ahrdware with backup battery.
    - ZRDOS or CP/M 3.0 software available.

If you can recommend specific products that match this description,
please let me know. The only one I have found so far is a Z280
single board computer from a company called Computer Design
Solutions, Inc. in Statesville, NC, phone: (704)876-2346. It sounds
good but technical info is meager and the board is currently
vaporware - in production around the end of the year (which year?).
They are quoting a price of $550 for the board with 128K RAM.
I have not heard of this company before. Does anyone have any experience
with them?

- sorry if this request got long winded, but I would really
  appreciate any advice.

I don't have any schematics or user manual for your board, but I do have some
BIOS drivers (From a Morrow BIOS) for your board.  It is indeed 3 serial ports,
and Morrow used this board in it's Decision-1 S-100 machines.  Morrow used
Port 1 for CON, Port 2 for RDR/PUN, and Port 3 for LPT (according to the
BIOS source).  I suspect that the 50-pin connector is used for all three
serial ports, but I don't have the pin mappings.
