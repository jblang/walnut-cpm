Thanks, Curt! Your derived version is much less flexible, though.
Those who want the original can get it via anonymous ftp from ftp.cs.kun.nl
as /pub/Z80Dis/z80dis.tar.Z. Excerpts from the README file:

It was originally (27 Dec 1989) posted to comp.os.cpm, shortly followed
by a patch (10 Jan 1990). The tar file includes the patch.

There is a Z80 & CP/M emulator on one of the Amiga PD collections - I seem
to recollect that it is in 68000 assembler, but given the closeness of Unix
and AmigaDos there would not be too much trouble in porting it to those
machines that have 680x0 in their guts.

Message-ID: <" 3-Dec-91 13:16:51 EST".*.Michael_D._Sprague.wbst311@Xerox.com>

The Xerox 820-II has a serial printer port built in, with a connector on the
back.  It is assumed that you will used a serial printer interface when
connecting a printer the the Xerox 820-II.  There is an optional parallel port
on the mother board though.


General Purpose PIO:
--------------------

As you stated, there is a 40 pin header inside the machine (J8), for connecting
up to the General Purpose PIO.  This port can be configured to support a
parallel printer interface.  To do so, you will have to build a printer cable,
configure the port, and then run the CONFIGUR utility on your CP/M system disk
(and any other system disk that will need to support the parallel printer).

Following is a pinout of the 40 pin connector, its pin assignment, and how
these pins are used for the parallel printer port option.

		   J8		Pin Assignment	Printer Assignment
		   --		--------------	------------------

		1	2
all odd		o	o	Port A STROBE
numbered	o	o	Port A READY

		o	o	Port A bit 5	Data Bit 5
		o	o	Port A bit 6	Data Bit 6
		o	o	Port A bit 7	Data Bit 7
		o	o	Port B READY

		o	o	Port B bit 4	Busy
		o	o	Port B bit 5
		o	o	Port B bit 6	On Line
		o	o	Port B bit 7	Acknowledge
		39	40


General Purpose PIO Hardware Configuration:
-------------------------------------------

To configure the hardware, you will need to add shunt jumpers to J11.  Jumpers
should be installed between pins 1 and 3, pins 5 and 6, pins 9 and 10, and pins
17 and 18.  This will configure the Port A and the lower 4 bits of Port B for
output, and the upper 4 bits of Port B for input.

		   J11

		o	o	Port B lower direction

		o	o	Port A STROBE polarity
		o	o	Port B STROBE polarity
		o	o	Port A lower direction
	+5 V	o	o	+5 V
		19	20


Parallel Printer Software Configuration:
----------------------------------------

When you run the CONFIGUR utility, select the "Select I/O Device Assignments"
option.  Change the "List" device to the Parallel Printer option.  Now exit,
and save the configuration.  Note the the "Print Screen" function on the
keyboard will no longer work.


Building the Printer Cable:
---------------------------

I have done this two different ways.  The first was to run ribbon cable into a
D25 connector, and then build a D25 to Centronics cable.  This took a little
more work, since I had to solder connections, but was easy to do.  Note that it
was NOT compatible with the IBM parallel cable.

The second way was to make a long ribbon cable, that went directly from the
820-II to the printer.  This can be obnoxious to do, since you need to cut and
move wires in the ribbon cable, in order to get them to line up with the
centronics.

A third option would be to run ribbon cable to a D25 connector, and make it
compatible with IBM's printer cable.  It's just not worth it though.  It will
cost you more than the second option, and you have to move even MORE wires than
you have to do with the second option.  Of course, you could run ribbon cable
directly to a D25 connector, and then buy one of those little interface boxes
that have a D25 on each side, and the ability to cross-wire what ever you need.
Then it would be pretty easy to make the final output compatible with an IBM PC
printer cable.

Here is the pin to pin connection I used for the second option (ribbon cable
from 820-II to printer).

Centronics	J8
----------	---
	 1	30
	 2	 6
	 3	 8
	 4	10
	 5	12
	 6	14
	 7	16
	 8	18
	 9	20
	10	40
	11	34
	12	36
	13	38
	14	26
	15	nc
	16	nc

	19	31
	20	 7
	21	 9
	22	11
	23	13
	24	15
	25	17
	26	19
	27	39
	28	33
	29	35
	30	37
	31	nc
	32	nc
	33	nc
	34	nc
	35	nc
	36	nc

I do not currently have a copy of what I did for option 1, though with a little
time, I'm sure I could come up with it.  If need be, I can also list the pin
out of the Centronics printer connector.  Note that the pins on the centronics
connector are numbered in a row (first row: 1-18; second row: 19-36), rather
than back an forth as on the 40 pin connector (first row: odd numbers; second
row: even numbers).

Latter, all.

Message-ID: <1991Dec11.012301.26863@salado.rc.arizona.edu>

A recent post by aduncan@rhea.trl.oz.au mentioned that a z80 and CP/M
emulator existed written in 68000 assembly language.  Thanks for the tip!

I poked around a bit, and found two of these in an amiga archive site, and
thought I would post the details in case others were interested.  I do not
own an amiga, probably never will, but I do own an ATT unix-pc which is a
68010 machine -- my thought is that an emulator carefully written in assembly
should far outperform one written in C.

My desire is to be able to run M80, L80, and a C-compiler using one of these
emulators on my unix machine, then I will have make and vi and be able to
generate code for embedded Z80 or 8085 projects.  All just plans at this point,
but if it ever flies, perhaps I will report back here.  As yet, I am not clear
which of these two I will use, and I imagine I will write some code in C on the
unix machine, and package the assembly language code as a routine within that.

Anyway here is what I found......

At the anonymous ftp site  gatekeeper.dec.com --

----------------------------------
cd pub/micros/atari/fish/f1/f165

cd pub/micros/atari/fish/f1/f165

Two earlier versions of this one are in the archives at gatekeeper.
This emulator was originally an 8080 job with Heath H19 support.
This version (2.0) now supports the full set of Z80 opcodes.
Was written by Jim Cathey and Charlie Gibbs and is dated  1-9-89

Subject: File copy utility with archive bit and datestamp ?
Message-ID: <2826@unixhub.SLAC.Stanford.EDU>

Does anyone know a cp/m utility similar to NewSweep, Wash or B29 which
- Knows about the archive bit (copy only files which have been 
  modified, and set the archive status bit after copying), and
- Knows about Novados (or SuperBDOS or cp/m+ or ...) style datestamps,
  and can propagate the datestamp from the source to the destination
  file when copying, and
- works with NovaDOS (or SuperBDOS or Z80DOS), which are a set of 
  enhanced BDOS replacements ?
A user interface as nifty as NewSweep, Wash or B29 is not required.

The use of such a utility is obvious: Backup, including incremental
backup.  The newer BDOSes already support datestamping and the archive
bit, so all the information is there. There is a program called
ARCOPY21 in the SIMTEL archive, which can do copying depending on the
archive bit, but it doesn't reset the archive bit on the source of the
copy, nor does it know about datestamps. Part of the problem could
probably solved with ZEX scripts, but again that doesn't help with the
datestamps.

Any pointers ? I do not use cp/m+ (aka cp/m 3.0), and I rarely use
ZCPR3.4 (aka NZ-COM), so I would prefer a tool which functions under
cp/m 2.2 with such an enhanced BDOS.

Jay, please ask the owner if he does not mean INTERTEC rather than with a final
K. The name of the system indeed rings a bell. INTERTEC was the manufacturer
of the famous SuperBrain series and I definitely remember they had a hard disk
based M/PM system which is very likely what you have there.
If this is correct then it runs any MP/M and CP/M software.
I may have very limited info hidden somewhere, of the kind a dealer would
provide "by the way" about the MP/M system when selling the stand-alone CP/M
one.

I think this machine was the diskless sibling (possibly the predecessor)
(and maybe even the predecedent) of the Intertec _Superbrain_ cp/m systems
we had at Scientific-Atlanta in about 1980-82.  My memory is that the system
had a single motherboard, very few options, the usual dumb-terminal cursor
addressing and character attributes (but no graphics), and came in three
disk configurations: one 5.25" DD/DS, two 5.25" DD/DS, and one diskette plus
one internal hard disk.  I could be wrong about the last.  My two-drive
model routinely burned out the disk drives, since they had rubber-band
drive and ran _all_the_time_.

The Superbrain looked like a reasonably smooth Adds terminal.  If your
Compustar looks like a terminal, it may _just_be_ a terminal.  If it
looks like a chassis, it may be a multiuser cp/m of some kind.  What
does it look like?  Any connectors which might be fast enough data
paths for a shared-disk transfer?

I have some old disks from my Superbrain, but don't at the moment have
any way to read them.  The sector size is too large for the BIOS of my
SD-Systems boat anchor, and I never got a 5.25" drive to work convincingly
with it, anyway.

Maybe this will jog someone's memory on the _Compustar_.

I'm not familiar with the Osborne, but if it's really composite video, an IBM
PC monitor won't work.  A TV with audio/video inputs, or a VCR, or a Commodore
1702 monitor would work.

Subject: Emulator
Message-ID: <gdGDFWq00WBL82ZYQy@andrew.cmu.edu>

After reading about the interest in emulators, I thought that I would post
this pre-release notice.  Several years back (you've heard this before...)
I wrote an 8080 emulator that ran CP/M modulo a couple of minor bugs.  I was
in the process of upgrading it to a Z80 emulator when I became interested in
other things.  I have been playing with it again and may even finish it...

My emulator is written in C for BSD Unix.  I intend it to be public-domain.
I keep my copy of CP/M 2.2 in hex on-line for testing, but users will have
to supply their own copy.  Perhaps someone could come up with some "free"
alternatives.

I have several "devices" that can be accessed:
1) multiple ttys
2) emulated disks (one disk per Unix file)
3) Unix file access

If anyone has ideas of things that they would like to see in a portable
emulator, let me know and I will try to work them in.  It may take a while,
but if there is enough interest, it may keep me interested...

    Well, I sent mail to Mike, but since there is more interest I'll post
it here.  The university I attend had two 11/780s back in, I believe, 1984.
One of these had a board in it sold by a company called Bridge something-
or-other.  It had four Z80H's on it running CP/M which users could access.
Any more than four got an emulated CP/M which was slower.  It used VMS
virtual disk files and had transfer utilities.  I can probably get more info
on it from the then-system manager, but I seriously doubt the company is
still in business or selling the boards.

The program you need is ACOPY.  The latest version is 3.3.  I'm not
sure if it is available in the net archives though.  If not you can find it
on ZeeMachine here in the San Jose area: 408-245-1420.  ACOPY 3.3 does
offer full support of datestamps and use of the archive bit.  The author
of the program calls ZeeMachine regularly and is more than happy to 
assist if you require any help, but I believe ACOPY should meet all of
your needs 'right out of the box'.

You mean you have ZCPR34 and actually prefer vanilla CP/M??

No. You should try to find an old monochrome monitor for the
C64. A CBM 1081 or 1084 should do the same job, but only b/w,
no color available.

The primary application for the slot was an 8086 board which gave a
limited MSODS 2.11 capability.  There was also a board that provided
what appears to be an IEEE-488 interface for an external hard disk.
There may have been an internal modem, but I never heard of it.

The pinouts for the serial ports are attached.  Probably if you are
using MEX+ you can use that VT-xxx emulator.  I forget whether it is
VT-100 or 52.

If you press Ctrl-Esc, you will get a status line along the bottom edge
of the screen that then permits setting a variety of things; including
key-click, screen brightness, baud rate, etc. and also displays time and
date.  Pressing the Tab key while the status line is present gives a new
status line with choices of Calculator, Screen Dump, Alarms, Install,
and Exit.  Each of these is a function of Valet which requires the
presence of the file VALET.VL2 on disk.

By the way, if you have not already discovered it, right shift & reset will
reset (cold boot) the Attache.

I'm not aware of any PD programs.  Sydex's shareware 22DISK,
MicroSolutions commercial UniForm-PC, are two programs with that
capability, however.  You are correct, they are standard 360k drives -
just 2/3rd high vice half high.

Hello,
 
Could someone please tell me if Aaron Contorer of ConCom Enterprises still
supports his Bradford printing program?  It is available from Simtel20 as
a fully function executable with little documentation.  I am interested in
getting the documentation.  A letter if inquiry to the p.o. box address
was never responded to.
 
If anyone is using Bradford could help me I would much appreciate it.  I am
having problems getting Bradford to properly indent paragraphs when printing
in justified mode.  Bradford is indenting BOTH sides of the line, instead of
just from the left margin.  Is there a special command it get it to indent
paragraphs?  I have noticed that none of the sample files that come with the
public distribution contain any indented paragraphs.

In a recent Info-cpm Digest, you let it be known that you were looking
for a program that would copy files and handle the "archive" bit in a
sane matter as well as handle date/time stamps under one of the BDOS
replacements. Try PPIP18.LBR. It should be on Simtel-20 in the
pd2:<cpm.dskutl> or pd2:<cpm.filutl> directories (guess the periods
should have been commas -- have VMS on the brain!). PPIP18 is pretty
slick and only 4 or 5 K to boot.

Hi everybody!  I just read the request for help on OSBORNE's video standard.
Well, it's really a standard composite video signal, that can be displayed on
any video monitor.  There's a trick though to get a reasonable display, since
OSBORNE does not use a standard screen size:  unwind the deflection coil of the
CRT by two circles, that should do it!
  
In any case, consult the FOG, First Osborne Group, on that matter.  I think
they discussed this in their famous FOGHORN.

    Well, I sent mail to Mike, but since there is more interest I'll post
it here.  The university I attend had two 11/780s back in, I believe, 1984.
One of these had a board in it sold by a company called Bridge something-
or-other.  It had four Z80H's on it running CP/M which users could access.
Any more than four got an emulated CP/M which was slower.  It used VMS
virtual disk files and had transfer utilities.  I can probably get more info
on it from the then-system manager, but I seriously doubt the company is
still in business or selling the boards.

Message-ID: <1991Dec11.012301.26863@salado.rc.arizona.edu>

A recent post by aduncan@rhea.trl.oz.au mentioned that a z80 and CP/M
emulator existed written in 68000 assembly language.  Thanks for the tip!

I poked around a bit, and found two of these in an amiga archive site, and
thought I would post the details in case others were interested.  I do not
own an amiga, probably never will, but I do own an ATT unix-pc which is a
68010 machine -- my thought is that an emulator carefully written in assembly
should far outperform one written in C.

My desire is to be able to run M80, L80, and a C-compiler using one of these
emulators on my unix machine, then I will have make and vi and be able to
generate code for embedded Z80 or 8085 projects.  All just plans at this point,
but if it ever flies, perhaps I will report back here.  As yet, I am not clear
which of these two I will use, and I imagine I will write some code in C on the
unix machine, and package the assembly language code as a routine within that.

Anyway here is what I found......

At the anonymous ftp site  gatekeeper.dec.com --

----------------------------------
cd pub/micros/atari/fish/f1/f165
binary ; get CPM.zoo

This emulator does Z80 and CP/M emulation, with ADM3A support.
Was written by Ulf Nordquist and is dated  10/88

----------------------------------
cd pub/micros/atari/fish/f1/f165
binary ; get SimCPM.zoo

Two earlier versions of this one are in the archives at gatekeeper.
This emulator was originally an 8080 job with Heath H19 support.
This version (2.0) now supports the full set of Z80 opcodes.
Was written by Jim Cathey and Charlie Gibbs and is dated  1-9-89
Apparently is based on a set of articles that appeared in Dr. Dobbs Journal
in January - March, 1986

Did you look at the RLE format - it's a nice simple and small monochrome
graphics format. It goes something like this:

ESC G H 

for the first three characters, then black and white color codes to fill
out the entire area of 256 * 192 pixels. The black and white codes
come in pairs, a byte for each value, black first, then white. The
two counts are simply the number of black pixels, followed by the number
of white pixels. Both values are offset by 20h to make them printable,
and the largest legal value is 7fh, encoding 5fh pixels (i.e. 95).

So to output continuous white, you'd say:

20 7f 20 7f 20 7f ..... etc. That'd give zero black, and 95 white
over and over. Note that the picture is filled in from the top
left corner, with lines running from left to right, and lines going
down. Also, if the number of pixels given wont fit on the remainder
of the current line, then simply take the excess and place those on
the start of the next line.

I think the original spec says to ignore values less than 20h, so that
cr/lf pairs can be added for readability. Also, If I were going to send
them as text files, I'd want to see about not using 7f, but making my
maximum value 7e, which _IS_ a printable character ('~'), where 7f
(DEL) is not.

Drop me a line if you want some sample RLE files, and maybe I can also
cook up some C code to convert a RLE file.

Just some comments. 1) Most of the tools you mentioned like
M80, L80, MAC, RMAC run on an 8080 machine and don't require
a Z80 (emulator).   2) If you have an old PC around, you can
get quite respectable performance with either emulators like
Z80MU or 22NICE.  3) Most unix 68000's use a peculiar brand of
68k assembly language mnemonics compared to Motorola standards.
For example, SIMCPM is written using Motorola mnemonics plus
quite a few macros.   
    Anyway, I would suggest getting the 8080emulator available
from hopf.math.purdue.edu (128.210.3.18) in the ~ftp/pub/cpm
directory, and trying it out to see if you really need higer
performance ( compared to the work of getting it).

I didn't write the emulator. I imported it from the U. Tokyo
archives, and the documentation is in Japanese. I figured the
configuration out from the source files. Someone in Australia
promised me a rough translation of the docs, but I don't have
them yet.

I think this machine was the diskless sibling (possibly the predecessor)
(and maybe even the predecedent) of the Intertec _Superbrain_ cp/m systems
we had at Scientific-Atlanta in about 1980-82.  My memory is that the system
had a single motherboard, very few options, the usual dumb-terminal cursor
addressing and character attributes (but no graphics), and came in three
disk configurations: one 5.25" DD/DS, two 5.25" DD/DS, and one diskette plus
one internal hard disk.  I could be wrong about the last.  My two-drive
model routinely burned out the disk drives, since they had rubber-band
drive and ran _all_the_time_.

The Superbrain looked like a reasonably smooth Adds terminal.  If your
Compustar looks like a terminal, it may _just_be_ a terminal.  If it
looks like a chassis, it may be a multiuser cp/m of some kind.  What
does it look like?  Any connectors which might be fast enough data
paths for a shared-disk transfer?

I have some old disks from my Superbrain, but don't at the moment have
any way to read them.  The sector size is too large for the BIOS of my
SD-Systems boat anchor, and I never got a 5.25" drive to work convincingly
with it, anyway.

Maybe this will jog someone's memory on the _Compustar_.

I'm not familiar with the Osborne, but if it's really composite video, an IBM
PC monitor won't work.  A TV with audio/video inputs, or a VCR, or a Commodore
1702 monitor would work.
