Actually, I'd think that the cp/m 3.0 "type" stamps that are
actually cp/m 3.0 compatible would be the most portable.  It would
allow 2.2 users to be compatible with the already existing standard
as defined by DRI in CP/M 3.0.

With a timestamp compatible with CP/M 3.0, ALL CP/M-80's would use a
single format!  existing CP/M 3.0 utilities (such as UNIX-like "make")
may be usable by 2.2 users (see the CPM3 section of Simtel20 archives).

I heartily agree with the desire for a uniform time-stamp mechanism.

I just brought up P2DOS in the past couple weeks so I could get this feature.
Although, as Bridger points out, it uses 1/4 of the directory entries, I find
I usually run out of disk space with only half of the entries used. If I'm
desperate for directory entries and don't care about timestamps (as I was last
night when I had to re-assemble SYSLIB3), I can always clear the directory.

Giving up 1-1.25K, as DateStamper requires, is a bigger issue for me. After my
years with a CP/M manufacturer (*years* ago!) I got perhaps unduly sensitive
to the issue of TPA. Some of the utilities I use like as much TPA as they
can get (what I hear of Wordstar 4.0, of which I am anxiously awaiting 
delivery, puts it in this category). I, for one, am reluctant to reduce the
available TPA on my system, especially since I already have the feature
without.

On the other hand, if the DateStamper mechanism were to become the standard,
I'd have less trouble justifying it. If the {P2,Z80,PZ}DOS reflects the CP/M-3
system, though, I'm not sure which system gets my nod.

I don't know much of DateStamper (is this a commercial product, Bridger, and
if so how much and where?), nor how it hooks into the system. The idea that it
is 808{0,5} compatible is great, it doesn't limit this feature to us Z80 users.
How is it destructively incompatible with the CP/M-3 method?

Also, are utilities written using CP/M-3's timestamp mechanisms usable with
P2DOS? I seem to recall somebody wrote a make utility for CP/M-3, for example.
I presume they wouldn't work with DateStamper.

The  one-line  descriptions  contained  in  the  files  SIMCPM.ARK  or

one minor correction is necessary to construct a DBASE II database for

structure has  been  entered via  the  CREATE command,  the  DBASE  II
command APPEND FROM SIMCPM.IDX DELIMITED loads the database.  The file
SIMCPM.IDX requires only one modification.  The beginning of each line

The full power of DBASE II is now available for searching through  the

I disagree with both postings to some extent.

(1) QP/M is actually just as portable as DateStamper and is a drop-in
replacement for CP/M 2.2.  Read this: you give up *no* extra memory and
*no* directory entries to have full time/date stamping of create/update/
backup.  If you don't have a real-time clock, that is ok; but having some
sort of counting clock helps.  You need a Z80 for this guy.  QP/M was
written from scratch as a Z80 operating system compatible with CP/M;
DateStamper was initially a set of patches to 2.2 but has evolved some
since.  I think both are fine (but I am biased to QP/M since I wrote it :-).
We already have a full set of utilities (such as QSWEEP, QPIP, QSTAT, QDIR,
QBACKUP, MAKEQ, CATALOGQ) available which uses the time/date value -
primarily through DOS calls explicitly assigned to time/date stamping.

(2) I take issue with the CP/M 3.0 method of stamping disks.  Only
a *single* date/time is supported (yuck), but you GIVE UP DIRECTORY ENTRIES.
Maybe this is not a problem when you:
     (a) start with a virgin disk
     (b) don't mind moving files to reformat
     (c) all of your files are large
but it has been my experience that the ratio of disk use to directory
use on many systems is pretty close percentage wise.  Floppy formats are
fixed, and it is stupid to increase the number of directory entries just
for CP/M 3.0.  A similar thought for hard drives: why search through all those
extra FCB entries which are really filename related?  A time/date file
(such as used by DateStamper [or was] and by QP/M) is a better alternative
in the CP/M world.

-------------

On the issue of compatibility, I agree completely.  Let's standardize
on something, the first being a time/date DOS call that fetches all of
the time/date information for a given file.  That way, even on the different
OSes, at least all time/date DOS calls would work.  A complete standard would
be much more difficult to implement at the file/directory level - as the
issues here can become religious :-)

I have an orphan computer (Visual Technology 1050) that runs
CPM3 (banked).  Does anyone have any experience (rumor?,
advice?) on adapting the CPM3 BIOS to run ZCPR3?  Following the
cookbook instructions in Richard Conn's user's manual were
spectacularly unsuccessful.  I also tried simply lifting out
the calls required for CPM 2.2, and then running SYSGEN on it,
to make the system into a cpm 2.2 system, and THEN following the
install procedure, but this was
also unsuccessfully.  (I have a sneaking suspicion that I have
to change the boot sector, but I have no proof, and I don't know
how to look at the boot sector.)

Perusing the postings I have noticed some discussion on other
BDOS replacements, such as Z80DOS and some others.  What are
their claims to fame, and how do they compare with each other
and with ZCPR?

How do I read and alter the boot sector (trk 0 sec 1 on my disks)?
Also, how do I read the first two tracks?  Can I change these
easily?  Is there a program available, preferably in the PD?
(I tried to write a quick and dirty one, and the results were
less than useful.  So I sez to myself, 'Why reinvent the wheel?')

Does anyone have any suggestions for a general purpose (and
inexpensive) general accounting program for CPM based
systems.

I realize this is a lot of questions, so I thank everyone
for their patience, and help.

I am posting this for a friend who owns a NEC-APC running

1) Can a version of BASIC still be obtained for this beast?

2) Does anyone have some advice in getting a version of

   there before so I'm familiar with the rudimentary
   procedures. Details and experiences with the APC
   or CPM-86 are appreciated, however.

3) Can anyone recommend a list of useful directories for
   the APC from simtel20? The <CPM.CPM86> directory looks
   like the place to start. Where to from here?

4) Finally, some information about the disk (8 inch)
   formats would be appreciated. From the documentation,
   there appears to be a single-sided single-density
   format (how many tracks and how many bytes per sector?)
   and a double-sided double-density format (again,
   what is the sector size and number of tracks?).

I intend to ftp software from simtel20 and cu20b.columbia
to our VAXen, then download to my own NEC-PC8801 to
store on 8 inch disks (if my format is compatible with the
APC). 

E-mail is the preferred medium for those wishing to respond.

Assembly language is compact and fast.  It's the most efficient way to
do simple tasks that deal with moving bytes of data, such as copying
and modifying files.  It allows the most sophisticated interfacing
with the CP/M operating system, which is itself written in assembly
language.  Many of the public domain programs on SIMTEL20 are written
in assembly language.  To learn more about 8080 assembly language,
review the tutorial contained in this ARK.  Eric Meyer, author of VDE,
wrote this series of articles entitled "Assembly Language
Programming"".  Thanks to Eric for allowing everyone to share this
wealth of information!

This file is also available on my RCP/M and on GEnie's CP/M
RoundTable.

Subject: Xmodem for 4.2/4.3 BSD Unix (and maybe Sys V)

In case you missed the update, Steve Grandi has an excellent Xmodem
for 4.2/4.3 BSD Unix.  It is available via standard anonymous FTP from
SIMTEL20 as:

Filename			Type	 Bytes	 CRC

Directory PD2:<UNIX.XMODEM>
XMODEM34.SHAR.1			ASCII	 84452  D010H

The xmodem program implements the Christensen (XMODEM) file transfer
protocol for moving files between 4.2/4.3BSD Unix systems and
microcomputers.  The XMODEM/CRC protocol, the MODEM7 batch protocol,
the XMODEM-1K block protocol and the YMODEM batch protocol are all
supported by xmodem.  For details of the protocols, see the document
edited by Chuck Forsberg titled XMODEM/YMODEM Protocol Reference.

This program runs on 4.2/4.3BSD systems ONLY.  It has been tested on
VAXes and Suns against the MEX-PC program from Niteowl Software and
the ZCOMM and DSZ programs from Omen Technology.

The author tried to keep the 4.2isms (select system call, 4.2BSD/v7
tty structures, gettimeofday system call, etc.) confined to the source
file getput.c; but makes no guarantees.  Also, no attempt was made to
keep variable names under 7 characters.  A version of getput.c that
MAY work on Sys V Unix systems is included.  See notes on other
changes for Sys V.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
[From the author]

Program history:

Descended from UMODEM 3.5 by Lauren Weinstein, Richard Conn, and others.

Based on XMODEM Version 1.0 by Brian Kantor, UCSD (3/84) (Don't blame
him for what follows....)

Version 2.0 (CRC-16 and Modem7 batch file transfer) (5/85)

Version 2.1 (1K packets) (7/85)

Version 2.2 (general clean-ups and multi-character read speed-ups) (9/85)

Version 2.3 (nap while reading packets; split into several source
	     files) (1/86)

Version 3.0 (Ymodem batch receive; associated changes) (2/86)

Version 3.1 (Ymodem batch send; associated changes) (8/86)

Version 3.2 (general cleanups) (9/86) (Released to the world 1/87)

Changes leading to version 3.3

1) "Better" handshaking for MODEM7 batch transfers (5/19/87).

2) If reception of a file is aborted due to errors, delete incomplete
file (5/19/87).

3) If an "impossible" tty speed is detected, assume 1200 bps (5/19/87).

4) Disallow CAN-CAN abort during file send or receive except at
beginning of file transfer (during batch transfers, CAN-CAN abort is
allowed at beginning of each file transfer) (5/19/87).

5) Uncouple total allowed errors during the reception of a single
packet (ERRORMAX, now made 10) and errors allowed when starting
transfer (STERRORMAX, set to 10) (5/19/87).

6) Fix some bugs when receiving an empty file and when a phase error
occurs during a file reception (5/19/87).

7) Portability fix in prtime and projtime; they also handle
pathological cases better (5/19/87).

8) During file reception an EOT is not believed unless it is sent
again in response to a NAK (5/25/87).

9) Modified cpm_unix and unixify so a filename without an extension
will not have a trailing dot in its filename after being received in a
MODEM7 or YMODEM batch transfer (5/25/87).

10) Allowable errors during transmission of a single packet now set to
ERRORMAX (5/27/87).

11) When transferring a binary file, the YMODEM file length field is
filled in on transmit and (if present) used to truncate the file on
reception.  A new truncate function (truncfile) added to getput.c to
do the deed (5/28/87).  The file mode field is also set but is ignored
on file reception.

12) In a batch receive (xmodem -rt), program can be forced into
checksum mode by specifying the "M" flag indicating a MODEM7 transfer
(5/30/87).

13) Changed the "B" option to "M" to indicate MODEM7 batch.  Made all
option flags case insensitive.  Command line is now recorded in the
log file (5/30/87).

14) The "KND/IMP" convention of using "CK" to invoke 1K packets during
YMODEM batch transfers was installed.  This code will be sent during a
batch recieve if "K" is included on the command line unless "M" is
also present.  This code will be recognized when sending under all
circumstances (5/30/87).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes leading to version 3.4

1) Fix usage message (10/2/87).

2) Sender will now try up to 10 times (EOTMAX) to send an EOT to
terminate a transmission.  Used to be 5 times, but Chuck Forsberg's
"official" minimum requirements for YMODEM mandate 10 (10/2/87).

3) Handle YMODEM file modification times if present in header on
reception of both binary and text files (10/2/87).  Retracted when
can't seem to get proper times whn playing with dsz (10/3/87).

4) Null bytes are now stripped out of files when received as text
files (MEX doesn't seem to want to put in the terminating control-Z)
(10/3/87).

5) Slightly modified terminal parameter setting to explicitly turn of
CRMOD and to flush read queue; ideas stolen from Kermit.  Will it fly
on Pyramid?  (10/3/87).

6) Decreased time between "startup" characters sent when starting a
file receive operation.  This should increase perceived response.  Now
waits only 2 seconds instead of 6 (waits for 5 seconds for subsequent
packets.  STERRORMAX now 30, CRCSWMAX now 15.  Timeouts on 1st sector
no longer reported in log (10/5/87).

7) Once again played with kernel sleeps in readbuf() (packet reading
routine).  On busy system could cause real problems.  Now supply flag
(t) to suppress sleeping on Too Busy systems.  No longer suppress
sleep when speeds are over 4800 bps.  Sleep kludge DOES help: on an
empty 750 running 4.3BSD, a file reception at 2400 bps used 6% of the
CPU with the sleep kludge and 24% without it (data transfer rates were
the the same) (10/5/87).

reception.  When YMODEM file length is set, stop writing characters
when reach length.  This will allow YMODEM file lengths to work for
text files and the elimination of truncfile() in getput.c (which was
impossible for SYS V) (10/5/87).

9) Another attempt at tty modes.  Now do nothing but set speeds, set
mode to raw, and turn off echoing and tandem (10/6/87).

Subject: Xmodem for 4.2/4.3 BSD Unix (and maybe Sys V)

In case you missed the update, Steve Grandi has an excellent Xmodem
for 4.2/4.3 BSD Unix.  It is available via standard anonymous FTP from
SIMTEL20 as:

Filename			Type	 Bytes	 CRC

Directory PD2:<UNIX.XMODEM>
XMODEM34.SHAR.1			ASCII	 84452  D010H

The xmodem program implements the Christensen (XMODEM) file transfer
protocol for moving files between 4.2/4.3BSD Unix systems and
microcomputers.  The XMODEM/CRC protocol, the MODEM7 batch protocol,
the XMODEM-1K block protocol and the YMODEM batch protocol are all
supported by xmodem.  For details of the protocols, see the document
edited by Chuck Forsberg titled XMODEM/YMODEM Protocol Reference.

This program runs on 4.2/4.3BSD systems ONLY.  It has been tested on
VAXes and Suns against the MEX-PC program from Niteowl Software and
the ZCOMM and DSZ programs from Omen Technology.

The author tried to keep the 4.2isms (select system call, 4.2BSD/v7
tty structures, gettimeofday system call, etc.) confined to the source
file getput.c; but makes no guarantees.  Also, no attempt was made to
keep variable names under 7 characters.  A version of getput.c that
MAY work on Sys V Unix systems is included.  See notes on other
changes for Sys V.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
[From the author]

Program history:

Descended from UMODEM 3.5 by Lauren Weinstein, Richard Conn, and others.

Based on XMODEM Version 1.0 by Brian Kantor, UCSD (3/84) (Don't blame
him for what follows....)

Version 2.0 (CRC-16 and Modem7 batch file transfer) (5/85)

Version 2.1 (1K packets) (7/85)

Version 2.2 (general clean-ups and multi-character read speed-ups) (9/85)

Version 2.3 (nap while reading packets; split into several source
	     files) (1/86)

Version 3.0 (Ymodem batch receive; associated changes) (2/86)

Version 3.1 (Ymodem batch send; associated changes) (8/86)

Version 3.2 (general cleanups) (9/86) (Released to the world 1/87)

Changes leading to version 3.3

1) "Better" handshaking for MODEM7 batch transfers (5/19/87).

2) If reception of a file is aborted due to errors, delete incomplete
file (5/19/87).

3) If an "impossible" tty speed is detected, assume 1200 bps (5/19/87).

4) Disallow CAN-CAN abort during file send or receive except at
beginning of file transfer (during batch transfers, CAN-CAN abort is
allowed at beginning of each file transfer) (5/19/87).

5) Uncouple total allowed errors during the reception of a single
packet (ERRORMAX, now made 10) and errors allowed when starting
transfer (STERRORMAX, set to 10) (5/19/87).

6) Fix some bugs when receiving an empty file and when a phase error
occurs during a file reception (5/19/87).

7) Portability fix in prtime and projtime; they also handle
pathological cases better (5/19/87).

8) During file reception an EOT is not believed unless it is sent
again in response to a NAK (5/25/87).

9) Modified cpm_unix and unixify so a filename without an extension
will not have a trailing dot in its filename after being received in a
MODEM7 or YMODEM batch transfer (5/25/87).

10) Allowable errors during transmission of a single packet now set to
ERRORMAX (5/27/87).

11) When transferring a binary file, the YMODEM file length field is
filled in on transmit and (if present) used to truncate the file on
reception.  A new truncate function (truncfile) added to getput.c to
do the deed (5/28/87).  The file mode field is also set but is ignored
on file reception.

12) In a batch receive (xmodem -rt), program can be forced into
checksum mode by specifying the "M" flag indicating a MODEM7 transfer
(5/30/87).

13) Changed the "B" option to "M" to indicate MODEM7 batch.  Made all
option flags case insensitive.  Command line is now recorded in the
log file (5/30/87).

14) The "KND/IMP" convention of using "CK" to invoke 1K packets during
YMODEM batch transfers was installed.  This code will be sent during a
batch recieve if "K" is included on the command line unless "M" is
also present.  This code will be recognized when sending under all
circumstances (5/30/87).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes leading to version 3.4

1) Fix usage message (10/2/87).

2) Sender will now try up to 10 times (EOTMAX) to send an EOT to
terminate a transmission.  Used to be 5 times, but Chuck Forsberg's
"official" minimum requirements for YMODEM mandate 10 (10/2/87).

3) Handle YMODEM file modification times if present in header on
reception of both binary and text files (10/2/87).  Retracted when
can't seem to get proper times whn playing with dsz (10/3/87).

4) Null bytes are now stripped out of files when received as text
files (MEX doesn't seem to want to put in the terminating control-Z)
(10/3/87).

5) Slightly modified terminal parameter setting to explicitly turn of
CRMOD and to flush read queue; ideas stolen from Kermit.  Will it fly
on Pyramid?  (10/3/87).

6) Decreased time between "startup" characters sent when starting a
file receive operation.  This should increase perceived response.  Now
waits only 2 seconds instead of 6 (waits for 5 seconds for subsequent
packets.  STERRORMAX now 30, CRCSWMAX now 15.  Timeouts on 1st sector
no longer reported in log (10/5/87).

7) Once again played with kernel sleeps in readbuf() (packet reading
routine).  On busy system could cause real problems.  Now supply flag
(t) to suppress sleeping on Too Busy systems.  No longer suppress
sleep when speeds are over 4800 bps.  Sleep kludge DOES help: on an
empty 750 running 4.3BSD, a file reception at 2400 bps used 6% of the
CPU with the sleep kludge and 24% without it (data transfer rates were
the the same) (10/5/87).

8) Actually count characters as they are being read for a file
reception.  When YMODEM file length is set, stop writing characters
when reach length.  This will allow YMODEM file lengths to work for
text files and the elimination of truncfile() in getput.c (which was
impossible for SYS V) (10/5/87).

9) Another attempt at tty modes.  Now do nothing but set speeds, set
mode to raw, and turn off echoing and tandem (10/6/87).

I can help with Kermit and the disk formats.  The NEC APC is an orphan
machine now, but way ahead of its time.  It's a shame to handicap it by
running CP/M-86 instead of MS-DOS.  NEC Information Systems still
offers support, software upgrades, and maintenance.

For the record, the NEC APC came out in 1983.  List price was slightly 
higher than a "similarly" equipped PC system, but discounts were
readily available.  In 1984, $ 3200 bought:

NEC APC, 8086 processor, 256K ram
640*512 graphics in 8 colors with monitor (VERY sharp - people still
are amazed when they discover the display is COLOR).  Two display
processors, one for text, one for graphics with hardware line and
circle drawing.  Special hardware for custom character sets.
Two 8" DSDD floppy disk drives (1.25 megabytes each), and the APC
printer.
Parallel and Serial ports are standard, 102 key keyboard.  22
Programmable function keys.
NEC 8023 graphics printer.

I've since added a math co-processor, and 640 K of RAM.

Standard (included free!) documentation included complete machine-
readable source listings of the BIOS and proprietary system utilities,
a System Reference Guide (including full technical details and
schematics), the MS-DOS Technical Reference Manual (far more
complete than the expensive IBM version, which wasn't even available
until 2 years later), MS-DOS user's guide, and bundled software
(WordStar, Multiplan, and DBASE II in my case).

I've never had a single maintenance problem since I've owned the
machine.

Now, can somebody explain how IBM sets the standards?!

The port of ZCPR3 (v. 3.3) to CP/M 3 systems is in the late-alph-test
stage, and release is projected for January.  Availability will be
announced here.

Z3ON3, the workname for this version of ZCPR33, is implemented as a
CP/M 3 RSX; it requires no changes whatever to the bios or system
tracks, and can be rapidly loaded and unloaded.  I expect it will
run on most/all z80-based cp/m 3 systems, with no system configuration
required.

Most Z-tools run without change, and we are cataloging those requiring
attention.  Programs that use these functions will need upgrading:

	direct bios file i/o
	disk size calculation from the allocation vector
	references to zcpr3 internal addresses (show, h, ...)

(Conversion of zcpr3 to an RSX has been a major system-programming
task; I would advise against attempting it yourself without
a very complete understanding of the internals of the cp/m 3 bdos
and ccp).

For those of us who still work with CP/M programming, something I've
always wished for would be a largish book giving terminal escape
sequences, disk formats, asynchronous communications info, and 
other related computer-specific info for the plethora of CP/M 
machines.  This would make it much easier for us to develop pro-
grams with a somewaht braoder market than heretofore possible.  
Judging from Micropro's sales of CP/M Wordstar 4.0, there's still
something of a market.

I wondered if this could be something we could undertake as an 
online project.  We could develop a template of requested info, 
allow places for further information, send the info to a central
gathering point, and gather it all into an ASCII text file (or 
files) that we could put out on various BBS's.  

Maybe while we're at it, we could include basic stuff like 8080
and Z80 mnemonics, CP/M and CP/M Plus BDOS and BIOS entry 
points and the like.  Maybe this would give us an opportunity
to develop something like an RSX that could deal with a standard
TERMCAP, allowing the development of near-universal screen-oriented
CP/M programs.  Any interest out there?

DU  uses direct bios file i/o to access disk sectors.  It's an
example of a program that needs repackaging to run under cp/m 3.
To use it, get CPM2RSX (or similarly-named RSX) and use the
CP/M 3 utility to encapsulate a COM file with that RSX.

That particular RSX converts  cp/m 2.2-style direct bios io calls
to cp/m 3 calls via the dos AND provides full physical->logical
sector deblocking.

However, as noted previously, you can't just put a zcpr3 cp/m 2.2 type
command processor on the boot tracks of a cp/m 3 system and
go; it requires rebuilding the interface from the ground up.

Am I missing something?  The newest version of DU I have seen,
version 8.9 (from sometime in 1984), is supposed to check whether it
is running on CP/M 1.x, 2.x, or 3.x, and adjust accordingly.
For example, it uses direct BIOS calls for 1 and 2, but
uses BDOS function 50 to do its BIOS calls in 3.

Meanwhile, I am in the process of converting DU to run on my MP/M system.
Has anyone already done this?

BTW, I assume we are talking about the same "DU"--the disk utility
which lets you read, write, and modify any sector on the disk.

I have a prog which a friend typed in from Nibble; it reads stars names,
and the two angles out of a file, asks you where you are in the world, and
what time it is, and plots the stars on the screen.  It's pretty slick.  it
slides the stars around as time goes on, and you can move a box to over
a star with the mouse and it'll give you the name, or you can type the name
and it'll flash the star if it's on the screen, or let you know if it's not.
It's called Planetarium- can send you a copy if you're int.

To: steep-mo-m@HUACHUCA-EM.ARPA

This is a week direction to start but it may yield a source.
Within the last couple of years I saw a TV show that described a group
of 12 year olds from England that had as a class project sat. tracking.
They were using computers (nothing fancy) and had punched in Russian
sat. data. These kids were not only computing azimuths, but also the
decaying orbits. Seems to me they also were one of the first to predict
the fall of the nuclear fueled sat that the Russians lost in Canada.
The coordinates they predicted were quite close to the actual fall site.

Good luck, I would also like a title of this software.

We have developed an interactive computer graphics system which includes the
items you mentioned in your message: display satellite ground tracks and which
will calculate and observer's azimuth and elevation angles.

This system is called TACK (named after a map tack) and is in operation at
several government locations.  To quote from one of our customer's Tech Notes:

'TACK is an interactive computer graphics system that integrates the following
capabilities:
   Map Generation,
   Geographic data display,
   Symbol generation and display,
   Satellite trajectory simulation and display,
   Simulation of concurrent multiple satellite flight,
   Satellite sensor footprint display,
   A geographic data-base management and reporting system based on
display-by-example,
   Construction and manipulation of abstractions of structures stored in
data-base files or created interactively.'

The system is designed to show satellite traces (and sensor footprints) on a map
generated on the screen from world data bank data (resolution up to world data
bank II).   Satellite orbital element information is stored locally or can be
input by the user.  Maps are drawn on the screen for several different
projections: Equirectangular, Lambert, Perspective, Mercator, Gnomonic.  The
area of the world displayed is determined either by the user or automatically by
giving a satellite and a time of interest.

The TACK system is in operation on several computer systems (IBM, & DEC) and
elements are available in workstation-based systems.

There is much too much other information about TACK to include in a message.
From what your message said TACK can fill your need, so please contact me
directly so we can discuss your requirements in more detail.

I am having trouble getting the one Zilog salesman who can send

I have an NEC PC8801-A, and I belong to the Turbo User's Group.  They (and

is buying software in the Osborne format, and having a friend of mine, who
owns Unidos, convert to my format.  Recently, TUG dropped the Osborne
format, so now I'm ordering in the Kaypro format.  I did get a utility with
my machine that lets me re-configure my drives to anything that CP/M can be
configured for without special hardware.  This means that if I can get the
SPT, BSH, etc. and the 1st sector ID, Density, etc. for the Osborne and the
Kaypro, then I don't have to wait for a couple of months when my friend's
machine isn't busy on a day that I have free.  If anyone knows what the
formats are, or if there's a product for CP/M machines like Unidos, please
e-mail the information to me.  Thanks.

responded that CP/M Plus was a mistake from the start and that 
they had no intention of porting ZCPR3 for CPM3.  So I'm interested
to learn that such a project is underway.  Does anyone know (a)
what advantages the CP/M Plus version of ZCPR3 would have over
CCP+; (b) whether the banked version of ZRDOS has been ported for
any banked CP/M Plus BIOSes; and (c) if so, which BIOSes have been 
supported (I have an Osborne Executive with about three different
BIOSes for it).

Sounds like a nice idea, and I could contribute info about one machine,
but I wonder how useful this might be in the long run. I suspect that
most CP/M users are now fairly knowledgeable (the dummies have gone to
MSDOS now :-), and certainly those who would be calling the BBSs would
have the knowledge to apply overlay patches for their system.

The fear I have is the plethora of terminals (take a look at the Unix
termcap files - you could extract a *lot* of info right there!), and of
weird disk formats that would require very specific knowledge of *in
advance* to handle.

For example of the latter, my Alspa machine (8") ALWAYS makes track 0
single density, track 1 double, and the rest of the disk as selected
(unless you are dealing with what it calls an IBM format, which is 
all SSSD). Now to confuse the issue, it does not translate double-density
sectors in the BIOS, it pre-formats them skewed!! (It will work if the
disk is formatted with the sectors in order, but oh, how slow it runs!)
I have no idea what the 5-1/4" disks are like.

As far as termcap capabilities, doesn't ZCPR3 make this available?

Are you proposing to collect the information?

I am also wondering about disk formats.  I would

Has anyone ever compiled a list of formats?

I assume a format description would include the following:

Recording format:  IBM (SD or DD) or Apple.
	This would also include definitions of gaps, CRCs,
	address marks, etc.  These are the truly controller-
	dependent characteristics.  

Number of sides and tracks:
	These are drive-dependent characteristics.

Sector size and sectors/track:
	Controllers can almose always be programmed for this.

CP/M filesystem parameters:

	Strictly software-dependent.

Has anyone ever seen a list.

Subject: Need Ithaca InterSystems I/O card info
Message-Id: <499@kksys.UUCP>
Sender: info-cpm-request@simtel20.arpa
To: info-cpm@simtel20.arpa

I have an Ithaca InterSystems I/O card, model 1110-01, for which I
have no documentation.  It seems to have two serial ports, what appear
to be two bidirectional parallel ports, and possibly other 'stuff'.
Unfortunately, it also has a plethora of jumpers on it.  Does anyone
have any information on this board?  I'd be happy to pay for a copy of
a manual.  Even a recent address for Ithaca would be helpful.  I can't
even find a copy of Byte that's old enough to have one of their ads.
Please reply via mail.  Thanks!

                              ===========

     INSTRUCTIONS:  We're attempting to gather as much information as we 
can  about  existing CP/M computers.   Our intention is to  compile  the 
results  into a large document file that will be made available to  CP/M 
users  and  developers  by way of electronic  Bulletin  Board  services, 
including  the comp.os.cpm newsgroup of Usenet.   Your participation  is 
very much appreciated.

     The  survey  forms which follow have been designed so that you  can 
copy,  fill out, and return them electronically.  Email is the preferred 
means of completing and returning the form, so that all information will 
be  immediately  available in machine-readable form.   Copy  the  survey 
forms which follow to your computer.  You might make copies available to 
local BBS's or Clubs which support CP/M.   Fill out as much  information 
as  you have,  and be as verbose as you will.   Try to give  information 
you  think  would help someone unfamiliar with your computer  trying  to 
port a new program to it.  

     We'd  also  appreciate other information in ASCII or Wordstar  text 
format  which you'd like to see in an omnibus CP/M  reference  document.  
Such   items  might  include:    8080/Z80/8085/Z280  opcodes,   language 
summaries  (e.g.,  Small C library functions),  standard BDOS  and  BIOS 
functions, and access to facilities of common software packages (such as 
the extended system calls for the BYE series).  If you have any thoughts 
on the formatting or distribution, we'd like to hear.  

     Please return the form via email to:

          tcamp@ecsvax.bitnet

Subj: Problems with the Pascal UUDECODER
Hi

I have a little problem: I suspect the standard cp/m UUDECODEr had a bug.

Here is the story: When i request a binary file (LBR, squeezed or suchlike)
from the BITNET server at RPI i have to request it as UUENCODED (because our
mail handler munches every binary file), and even then all the (up-arrow) are
converted into ^(twiddle). So, i transfer the UUENCODED file to the cp/m micro,
and run it through the regular UUDECODER (made from
PD:<CPM.STARTER-KIT>UUDECODE.HEX or .PAS, from SIMTEL20 or the server at RPI).

Unfortunately, the UUDECODER doesn't like the file: he complains about the
second to last line being too short (in 80% of the cases). Here an example:
M56<')',8<%.%1QT% "X$]#0&\C$#$#0#D#296#4&0'D5%%64$-?T#D#(#-/M
MVP@!H) "(0 V+!H:&AH:&AH:&AH:&AH:&AH:&AH:&AH:&AH:&AH:&AH:&AH:M
3&AH:&AH:&AH:&AH:&AH:&AH:&@M  <----- this line is (supposedly) too short
 M
end

And, even worse, in the rare case that UUDECODE doesn't complain about such a
line being too short, sometimes the output file is wrong (like several
characters missing). But, miracle, some files get through without any problem.

On the other hand, i am sure that the uuencoded files did NOT get munched
on the way to the micro (test: transmit it back, and compare).

I have tested this with more than 30 files, and after a while it is no fun any
more. So, the question is: does this UUDECODEr have a known bug, am i making a
mistake, or what ? Maybe the UUENCODER used by the server is wrong (but that
sounds VERY improbable).

Any help is appreciated. As usual: if i get enough answers, i'll summarize
then to the net.

Check out a book called:

A Programmer's Guide to Video Display Terminals 

by David Stephens
Atlantis Publishing 1985
ISBN 0-936158-01-8

It has the escape sequences indexed by Manufacturer, Terminal, Curson
Address Lead-in, Clear Screen, etc.

It also has some info on the ANSI X3.64 standard.

I think it would be terrific.  I use a Perkin-Elmer terminal w/ my CPM 
system, and have had to go into a PD program and figure out it's hard-
coded escape sequences and replace or null them out.
Would terminfo be a start?

  It has been done to an extent. From my old CP/M application programming days
I have a book that lists 145 terminals and PC's one per page listing:
   -Screen Layout in rows and columns
   -Row, col numbering scheme
   -Cursor addressing and examples
   -Erasure
   -Video Attributes
   -Cursor keys
   -Character Set
   -Emulation
   -Function keys
 
   It's invaluable (and was when you could make money in CP/M). It has a few
weaknesses because it doesn't know about any real bells and whistles, and
some of the info on wierd 'magic cookie' HP terminals and such doesn't even
begin to describe the Twilight Zone design of them, but on the whole the book
is very accurate.
 
   It has just about every PC and terminal that existed in 1985.
 
It's:
     A Programmer's Guide to Video Display Terminals
     by David Sthephens
     1985 Atlantis Publishing Corporation
     P.O. Box 59467
     Dallas, Texas 75229
     ISBN 0-936158-01-8
 
  I haven't a clue wether this company exists anymore, or if there is a
  newer version. I've got mine and it would take a $lot$ of money to
  take it away. It has been invaluable on a number of occasions. I mean
  where else could you find the cursor movement sequences for a Franklin
  Ace ? :-)

  Perhaps we could find the author and persuade him to post his term database ?

My face is (seasonally?) red.  The generic DU does, indeed, check
for CP/M 3 and use BDOS function 50.  I have been testing with
"DU3", a Rick Conn variant of DU that has only CP/M 2.2 capability.

CP/M 3 users should use generic DU.
When ZCPR33 is released for CP/M 3, DU3 users will be able to
run that version under an RSX.

Jeff,
Our (limited) experience at Plu*Perfect Systems with MicroSphere
add-on products for Kaypros has been that their software is not
relocatable.  Thus, although the Advent and MicroSphere hardware should be
compatible, and the Plu*Perfect/Advent TurboRom software is
relocatable, you may have a problem if you need to put their drivers
anywhere other than the hard addresses for which they were assembled.

Bridger:
I didn't think that software would be a problem, since as far as I can tell,
one uses Z80 port i/o to talk to the uSphere Color Board.  Of course, this
could still be a problem if it and Advent's Ram disk happen to use the same
port addresses.  I'd probably better look into that, too.  

What I was originally concerned about was that Color Board uses the rear-most
SIO chip (socket on a ribbon cable plugs in underneath the SIO), and that
since the Advent Host Adapter comes up right next to this chip, it would be
physically impossible to install it.

Someone should load her down, I could always distribute it, but that would

  I've been working on a format program to do exactly that for my own
8" DSDD system (S100, SD Systems controller with WD 1791, Jade Z80
CPU) so I could change skew factors without messing around in the BIOS
or figuring out some scheme to tell it what skew to use.

  I do skew calculation 'on the fly' now, rather than having to
re-build the tables, and a little experimentation has convinced me to
adopt a skew of 2 for most situations. The person from whom I bought
the system had used no skew at all. It loaded programs very quickly,
but re-logging the directories after rebooting was almost painful :-).
Unfortunately, I have a LOT of disks already recorded in that format,
and would really rather not have to go back and copy the lot over...
although, come to think of it, it might be simpler...

  I can see no reason why a PROPERLY SELECTED skew would not work very
nicely in a pre-formatted configuration. Do you know whether there
might be some reason _other_ than the choice of skew factor, which
could be causing the problem?

  If you have the source for the format program and wouldn't mind
sending me a copy, I would very much appreciate it.

Subject: Re: Problems with the Pascal UUDECODER
In-Reply-To:  RALPH@UHHEPG -- 12 DEC 87 01:14-

The Pascal UUDECODE appears to be in complete agreement with all
of the other UUDECODE programs I've been able to compare it to.
The problem is being generated by the uuencoder used by the Bitnet
file server.

Apparently, the (correct) uuencoders always construct encoded data
that is a multiple of 4 bytes (which becomes 3 bytes when decoded).
The encoder used by my server encodes only the exact number needed.
Some, if not all, of the standard decoders depend on finding a
multiple of 4 bytes, thus the error.

At any rate, I'll repair my uuencoder as soon as possible.  However,
if you take any of the files you have that are a problem and replace
the trailing "M" in the problem line with "   M" (3 spaces and "M")
you should be able to circumvent the error.

1. Z280:
Scott Moore at Zedux, 818-787-0113 voice, 818-787-0458 bbs has a Z280
board running with a multi-tasking OS he supplies with it.  It
supports multiple cp/m partitions, but not zcpr3.

2. Z3ON3 -- the port of ZCPR33 to CP/M 3 (CP/M PLUS) that is under
development -- will provide essentially all ZCPR3 features on a CP/M 3
system, including:

	z3 external environment descriptor
	zcpr33 command processor
	flow control (FCP)
	resident command processor (RCP),
	z3 termcap
	z3 named directories
	but NOT: input/output packages (IOP).

Most CP/M 3 features remain active:
	hashed directories
	bdos disk buffering
	RSX capability, including PUT/GET redirection

There are some changes:
	multiple command line is zcpr3 style
	file-level passwords not supported by the command processor

Importantly, no bios changes are required -- Z3ON3 will be a "drop-in"
RSX; the user will install and remove "ZCPR33" features from a cp/m 3
system dynamically, with one command.


3. Echelon developed a banked version of ZRDOS for the DT-42, with a
cp/m 2.2 bios.  I don't believe any other banked versions have been
developed.  Trying to do one for a CP/M 3 bios would be problematic
at best, because CP/M 3 makes fundamental changes in the bios/bdos
disk i/o interface.

Has anybody ever managed to get Kermit to work under M/PM?  Is there a simple

	On-chip peripherals: One serial port, 4-DMAs, 3 counter timers.

	Paged memory management, supporting virtual memory and
	seperated code and data space.

	User and system modes, allowing 'illegal opcode' traps
	for things like I/O in user mode.

	A 256-byte cache.

	Configurable for a 16-bit bus interface with to do burst
	reads (4 words in one bus cycle).


This is a very sophisticated chip.  With a 16-bit bus and burst memory,
you shopuld get about 5x speedup, as far as I can tell.
With an inproved compiler for the new instructions, even more
speedup will result.  The chip has been available for several months;
single unit price is about $40.
It blows away the Hitachi HD61480 chip, which is also a Z-80 enhancement.
That chip has virtually no added instructions, no new addressing modes,
crude memory management, no protection, and the same old Z-80 bus interface.

By the way, the Z-280 will also run with the standard Z-80 bus, as well
as the 16-bit bus.

There three programs that I am aware of:

Media Master (I can't remember the manufacturer, but it's one I have for
my Kaypro)
Compat from Mycroft Labs

Uniform is probably your best bet.  They seem to have versions for all

I am somewhat confused.  I have downloaded two terminal pgms for my
Osborn I that are supposed to run off the serial port.  Neither does.

In my reading, I have come across the explanation of the "STAT"
command which allows me to assign any physical device to a logical
device.  My problem is that I can't figure out form the book exactly
what that means.

According to the Ref manuel I have the following logical devices:

  CON: >> Keyboard + screen
  RDR: >> serial/parallel/ieee  (Can anyone tell me what a "reader" is)
  PUN: >>   "        "      "   (Can anyone tell me what a "punch" is)
  LST: >>   "        "      "

I have the following physical devices:

  TTY:
  CRT:
  BAT:
  UC1:
  PTR:
  UR1:
  UR2:
  PTP:
  UP1:
  UP2:
  LPT:
  UL1:

Does anyone have a simple explanation for all this, or even a not so
simple one would be a help.

From what I have found, the RS-232 (Serial) port and the 9 pin (modem)
port have about the same functions.  Book says "the modem and RS-232
interfaces are basically one and the same; the primary difference is
that many of the signal levels on the RS-232 connector are help
constant, while you can manipulate them using the modem connector."

It goes on further to say: "If all you need to do is read to and from
the modem/or serial port, simply change the IO BYTE indirectly by
using the CP/M STAT command..."

Seems to me I should be able to run a standard modem off the RS-232
port if I can change the IO BYTE.  Any ideas?

Thanks in advance.

Yes, I have been using various versions of CP/M Kermit on my
Z-80 S-100 MP/M system for several years.  The latest is
CP/M Kermit 4.05, but I have also used the Turbo Pascal
QKKERMIT.

All I did was use the standard technique of putting in my
initialization code and code to read and write the correct
I/O ports for my serial board.  So, it is really just like CP/M.

How did I manage this?  Well, my modem is on a serial port that
is known to MP/M as a user terminal, but I tricked MP/M into ignoring
it by pulling the jumper on the board so that the input interrupt
is disabled.  Ordinarily, as soon as a character came in from the modem
MP/M would service the interrupt, grab the character, and put it in
the input buffer for that user.  Since I wanted Kermit to be able
to test for and grab the character, I had to disable the interrupts.
So, MP/M never knows that a character has come in.

If you have to use a port that is serviced by MP/M, you will have
to access it through the operating system.  
I see two ways to do this.  One is to do BIOS calls, putting in the
correct terminal number in the right register so as to sense
and fetch from (and send to, of course) the right serial port.
The other is to use the BDOS status and in/out calls, which always
refer to the "attached" terminal.  Then keep giving the 
BDOS (actually XDOS) calls that attach and detach the two terminals,
namely the one assigned to your console and the one assigned to the modem.

Hope this helps.

Also, I seem to recall that when the MODEM700 series of terminal
programs came out several years ago, someone generated suggested
patches for MP/M.  Maybe these would give you some ideas.

From: Lee Rimar
Re:   Ideas on file splitting

    Sometimes I get a text file so large it becomes clumsy to edit.
WordStar gets very slow on big files, and hogs disk spaces.  VDE
limits file size to available memory, usually around 48-52K.

    There are file splitting programs, but they have problems.  Many
are written in Pascal, big and slow.  Assembly language versions are
much better.  But they all work by copying the big file into several
small files.  Time consuming, and takes up more disk space.

    I have a faster way to do it.  Maybe a trick "old hands" in CP/M
have known for years, but I've never seen/heard it mentioned:

    Use a disk editor to modify the directory entry for the file.
Changing a few bytes in each physical directory extent can "split" a
file into several smaller files.  Typically these files will be 16K,
but it depends on physical/logical extent layout.

    You should work only with back-ups or scratch disk.  Also a good
idea to run a directory "Sort & Pack" program first.  A "cleaned-up"
directory is easier to work with.

    With SODU82 (Screen Oriented DU, v8.2), I can split any size file
into 16K blocks in less than a minute.  But I'm doing it manually.  I
look at the directory entries, decide what bytes to change, and key in
the values myself.  I think a program to automate this could do the
same thing in 2-3 seconds.  But I've never seen such a program, and
don't know assembly language well enough to write one.

    Which leads me to the 64K question(s):  Has anyone ELSE seen such
a program?  Would anyone consider writing one?  Let me know . . .

If he hasn't tried it already, perhaps the Generic Kermit for CP/M 3.0

Filename			Type	 Bytes	 CRC

NULU152A.LBR			BINARY	 56192  C306H

NULU152A is a new release (from England) of Martin Murray's "NULU" LBR
file maintenance utility for 8080 and Z80 CP/M computers.  The
original documentation for NULU version 1.5 (included in the library)
still applies except for the section headed NULU MODIFICATION where
the patch addresses have changed.  These have been detailed in
NULUMOD.DOC and NULUTERM.ASM.

This version corrects the problem with prior versions of NULU, when 
extracting data from a library on one drive to files on another.  This 
was found to be due to a bug in the CP/M 2.2 BDOS associated with BDOS 
function 37 (Reset Drive).  It also corrects a problem with the Krunch 
command.  The changes made are discussed in detail in NULU152.INF 
included in the LBR.

You should get this file even if you are not interested in NULU
because it contains some very informative information on undocumented
features in the CP/M 2.2 and CP/M-Plus BDOS.

This file is also available on my RCP/M and on GEnie's CP/M
RoundTable.

I may not be able to answer all your questions, but I'll take a shot at
what I can.

>   RDR: >> serial/parallel/ieee  (Can anyone tell me what a "reader" is)
>   PUN: >>   "        "      "   (Can anyone tell me what a "punch" is)

These are from the days of my relative youth, John, back when much computer
I/O was done with paper tape.  Much, but not all, of that paper tape was
run through Teletype Model ASR-33 terminals, which were a) reasonably cheap
and b) about the only terminals available.  The ASR-33 is really three
devices in one:  a hardcopy terminal (keyboard and printer), a paper tape
reader, and a paper tape punch.  The three devices all share the same
serial line, which can be wired either half- or full-duplex.

Because a given program may need to talk at different times to various
physical devices whose characteristics may differ widely, CP/M allows you
an easy way to do that.  It embodies the concept of "logical" devices,
which exist only in software.  CON:, KBD:, RDR:, and PUN: are the CP/M
logical devices.  Think of them as black boxes.  It is the task of  the
BIOS to translate the communications to and from the proper formats. 
Inside each of the black boxes, the translation is made between the
program's data transfer protocol and that of the physical device to which
the logical device is assigned.  For example, suppose you want to sell
bread in cases of 12 loaves.  People buying bread want only one loaf at a
time.  You hire a person to take the loaves out of the cases and sell them
one at a time.  You are transferring bread to a logical device named
"Middleman" who is in turn transferring it to physical devices named
"people".

In the case of RDR: and PUN:, these logical devices can be assigned to
physical device TTY: along with logical devices CON: and KBD: -- the result
is that you can then use the paper tape stuff on the Teletype simply by
knowing the right time to stop and start the reader or punch.  Or they can
be assigned to PTR: and PTP:, which are most likely the RS232 port.

On your RS232 connector, signals like DSR (Data Set Ready), CTS (Clear to
Send), and DCD (Data Carrier Detect) are probably wired true so that the
connector will look like a fully functional and ready modem to any printer
that you may attach.  

Other signals such as DTR (Data Terminal Ready) and RTS (Request to Send)
may be wired true so that you can connect a modem without having to
manipulate all the complex RS232 protocol.  Doing this, however, does limit
your ability to monitor system faults, because your hardware won't see it
if the modem goes south.

Seems to me that you're probably right.  But changing the I/O Byte may not
be necessary.  You may be able to just assign RDR: and PUN: to the
appropriate port.

Here is an explanation of your physical devices:

  TTY:	a hardcopy terminal, (originally a KSR-33) 
  CRT:	video terminal (CONsole)
  BAT:	the BATCH control file
  UC1:	Secondary COMM port
  PTR:	COMM port IN (also the paper tape "reader" of the KSR-33)
  UR1:	supplemental i/o IN
  UR2:	        "
  PTP:	COMM port OUT (also the paper tape "punch" of the KSR-33)
  UP1:	supplemental i/o OUT
  UP2:          "
  LPT:	the primary LIST device, (LST:), a printer, usually serial.
  UL1:	?

>Does anyone have a simple explanation for all this, or even a not so
>simple one would be a help.

Stat allows you to tie a logical name eg: (CON:) to a *particular* physical
device eg: (TTY:) so that standard CP/M system calls will access the
correct port on YOUR system.

an example might be: 	A>stat dev:<ret>
the system might return:
			CON: is CRT:			 
			LST: is LPT:
to change the assignments:
			A>stat logdev:=physdev:<ret>
such changes are TEMPORARY, a ^C will restore defaults.  But this will
allow you to find which devices will run your prog's and you can sysgen
the changes if need be (or modify the prog's to use the correct calls
for your devices).
	Hope this is what you needed.		[dale]

For those of you who may be filling out the CP/M Survey form, let me
make a couple of notes.  If you don't have the time to fill in all
the RS232 info, please indicate (if you can) what UART or SIO chip
your computer uses, and (again, if you have it) what ports are
utilized.  We can deduce a lot from this.  If your computer emulates
a standard terminal (ADM3A, ANSI, etc.), you do not need to fill
out the entire escape sequences.  At this point, however, I have not
yet received forms from Kaypro users--and we'd like to have copies
of their escape sequences.  If you have a Kaypro 10, '84 series
Kaypro, or an earlier Kaypro model, I'd encourage you to fill out
the escape sequences.  Thanks very much.  Osborne Users:  we've 
got the basic O1 and Executive information.  If you're a Vixen
user, you might just drop a note and indicate the extent to which
its terminal sequences differ from the O1 or Exec.

Subject: PIPing random files


My thanks to all those who replied concerning problems when PIPing
random files.  Many pointed out that the O option must be used to
prevent PIP from seeing ^Z as an EOF.  Unfortunately, we had already
done this.  

I am afraid the most accurate (if not the most helpful) reply pointed
out "it can't be done."  Actually, it can be SOMETIMES done.  I have 
PIPed random files and had it work.  I have also had it fail miserably!
No one had a utility which interpreted the random record info and 
copied the file correctly.  Sigh.

Again,  much thanks.     mknox

DosDisk -- a MS-DOS Disk Emulator for CP/M -- has just been completed.
It may do more, or less, than what you need, depending...

DosDisk runs on CP/M 2.2 or 3 systems that have a "modern" bios that
can support foreign disk formats.  Currently, it is preconfigured
for Kaypro with Turborom or QPM, Morrow MD3 and MD11, ON!, Ampro
LittleBoard, Xeros 820-I with Plus-2 rom, and Commodore C128.

The kit version, for assembly-language buffs, can be configured for
other supporting bioses.

Unlike file-transfer programs such as Uniform and MediaMaster,
DosDisk allows cp/m programs to use the pc disk *directly* --
i.e. you can run WordStar, dBase, ... on files on the pc disk,
no copying is needed.  Effectively, the pc disk becomes a cp/m disk
in a cp/m computer.

If you don't have a suitable bios, or if you need only to copy
files, Uniform, MediaMaster or one of the CP/M public domain
transfer utilities may be what you want.

If you want to use the CP/M disk on an MS-DOS computer, Uniform and
other companies have similar MS-DOS utilities.

A DosDisk announcement should be forthcoming to this list shortly.

Howdy!

I am looking for people using Apple CP/M who have actually PAID (Yes,
PAID) MicroPro for WordStar v.4, CP/M edition.  I am asking because
MicroPro has basically shafted me.... I paid $94 dollars to upgrade to
the new software, and it is unuseable on my system (//+ with a
StarCard and a generic 80-column card).  This is extremely unusual
because the old WordStar (v.3.33) worked perfectly.

  Any help with this would be greatly appreciated.  Send E-mail, and
if I get enough responses, I'll summarize.

>From: "Cynthia_A._Burnett.Sunnyvale"@Xerox.COM

>can anyone help?  

One of the quickest, hassle-free ways to copy CP/M to MS-DOS (also
least expensive) is to use an MS-DOS comm. program (QMODEM is a
good one) to receive RS-232 from the CP/M machine.  There are some
limitations, however.  You have to have access to both computers
at the same time, and be able to cable them together.  You must
convince the CP/M machine to transmit the file to its serial port.
And, of course, non-ASCII files present more of a challenge.  I
have a Cromemco S-100 that uses a serial device for CONSOLE.  A
PC clone makes a wonderful dumb terminal for the Cromemco, and
QMODEM running on the clone lets me move files both ways.  You can
pick up a copy of QMODEM from one of the PD services for $3 to $5.
Computer shows in the Bay Area almost always have at least 6 PD
software booths.   Good Luck!  :+)

We have received UCPM survey forms for Osbornes, Apple CP/Ms, 
Compupro, and other CP/M computers.  An obviousy missing category
is Kaypro and Mrrow.  If you're familiar with either computer,
please return a form.  We'll need rsponses from Kaypro users 
with 83 and 84 series graphics, and fMorrows witharious terminal
configurations.  Thanks.

                              ===========

     INSTRUCTIONS:  We're attempting to gather as much information as we 
can  about  existing CP/M computers.   Our intention is to  compile  the 
results  into a large document file that will be made available to  CP/M 
users  and  developers  by way of electronic  Bulletin  Board  services, 
including  the comp.os.cpm newsgroup of Usenet.   Your participation  is 
very much appreciated.

     The  survey  forms which follow have been designed so that you  can 
copy,  fill out, and return them electronically.  Email is the preferred 
means of completing and returning the form, so that all information will 
be  immediately  available in machine-readable form.   Copy  the  survey 
forms which follow to your computer.  You might make copies available to 
local BBS's or Clubs which support CP/M.   Fill out as much  information 
as  you have,  and be as verbose as you will.   Try to give  information 
you  think  would help someone unfamiliar with your computer  trying  to 
port a new program to it.  

     We'd  also  appreciate other information in ASCII or Wordstar  text 
format  which you'd like to see in an omnibus CP/M  reference  document.  
Such   items  might  include:    8080/Z80/8085/Z280  opcodes,   language 
summaries  (e.g.,  Small C library functions),  standard BDOS  and  BIOS 
functions, and access to facilities of common software packages (such as 
the extended system calls for the BYE series).  If you have any thoughts 
on the formatting or distribution, we'd like to hear.  

     Please return the form via email to:

          tcamp@ecsvax.bitnet
     or   tcamp@dukeac.bitnet
     or   T.CAMPBELL1 on the Genie System.

     If you need to return a hardcopy, you may send it by U.S. snail to:

Subject: Re:  Apple CP/M WordStar v. 4?

Jonathan - I did the same as you and purchased the upgrade deal.  I also
have a similar system to yours (a ][+, a Starcard and a generic (Videoterm
compatible 80-col card).  I had a minor problem getting it to work, I had 
trouble with the Erase to End of Line code, but it now seems to work.  
Now I come to think of it, I have not installed the printer yet, so I don't 
know whether there is any problem there.  I bought the Apple specific version
and I also know someone who bought the generic CP/M version and patched it
to work with the Applicard/Starcard.  What specific problems are you having?

Why don't you give us a hint about what's troubling you instead of just
the flames ?

Some suggestions:

	Are you running v1.6 or 2.0 or the StarCard CP/M implementation ?
	v2.0 is much nicer and might help you out, and it's still available
	from PCPI ~$40.

	Try 'genning up the software 70-column mode and see if that works.
	The new WS might hate your 80-column card.  If that works we can
	address the 80-column card problem next.

	You've got a supported product now - have you called MicroPro yet ?
	You won't be alone because they sold oodles of those things...

	Have you INSTALLed the WS yet ?  Last time you bought it it came
	ready-to-go...

	Primary questions here are, if you have heard of the Visual
1050 desktop computer, is it (reportedly) KAPRO compatible?
	One is affecting my life through my sister who aquired one,
and thus far I have managed to figure out that it will talk via
telenet as an "ansi" terminal on the UNIX machines.
	Furthermore, I have seen the supplied software includes
a CPM base and Wordstar plus a few other kwown programs. 
	The innards include a 6502 (co)processor(?) some NEC
chips, two single(?) sided 96 TPI drives etc.
	Any help out there?
	I would like to grant my sis the proper termcap, an ansi sys
and amongst other things, an executable for Hack, and direction
towards the preferable OS whether it be xx-DOS or stick with CPM.
	The supplied terminal emulator called tty1050 (which I am
using to compose this) seems to only be capable of ASCII file
transfers via a trap method. Is there anything else available for this
machine?

	Any responses to the effect that this boat anchor could be
replaced with a (pick your favorite clone) should be directed to
/dev/null. Any real help with this problem will be graciously
appreciated.

 About: Z-Node Central Moving Again (18 lines) 

Z-Node Central is moving again.  Echelon is moving their operations 
to the Lake Tahoe area and are therefore giving up their office space 
in Los Altos, where this system currently resides.
 
One of the factors in making the decision as to where to move this 
system was PC Pursuit access.  As some of you know, the original location 
of this system (my home) is not accessible via PC Pursuit.  Thus, moving 
the system back to my house was not feasible.
 
So, the decision has been made to move the system to someone else's 
home.  Consequently, I will no longer be the primary sysop here, but 
I will continue to actively participate.  The new sysop will be Ron 
Bardarson, and the move date is next monday, November 30th.
 
So, remember, after November 30th, the new phone number of Z-Node Central 
will be changed to 408/432-0821.  Please copy this message and post 
it far and wide to hopefully get it to the folks who call infrequently.

Subject: Backgrounder II


I have recently purchased Backgrounder II and, from what I have seen so far, it
should make a very useful addition to my CP/M system.  I use an Apple II+ with
a PCPI Applicard.  The Backgrounder II swap file resides in the 222K PCPI
Ramdisk and this provides fairly quick "swap" operation (about 1 1/2 seconds).
It may be that I have not yet learned all that I need to about BGII, but two
functions are giving me problems.  The JOT function appears to work and I can 
enter notes into the notepad, but if I exit from it with the SUSPEND character
and then return again to JOT, the original text which I put in the JOTpad is 
not there.   The JOTPAD file has been created and exists in the directory, but
listing it (e.g. with "V" from NSWP) confirms that the file does not contain 
the entered text.  The other difficulty is with the SCREEN function.  This only
partially works.  If for example I list (while in foreground CP/M) a listing 
from NSWP, the printed output from SCREEN or the contentes of a file generated
by SCREEN FILENAME are incomplete and the text is displaced to the right by
about thirty characters.  I am suspecting that there may be a problem with the 
screen driver (or maybe I don't have my terminal characteristics installed
correctly; though I don't think that this is the problem as other BGII
functions which use most of the terminal control commands seem to work OK).
The driver that I am using is PCPI-VDX.DRV.  This was a modification of the
Apple IIe screen driver which has been around for a while.

If anyone can make has had any similar experiences, or can suggest any 
solutions, I would appreciate it before I am tempted to dive in to the screen
driver code.

Yes.  In the Zenith Z-100 world which contains both an 8085 and a
8088, there is a ZCPM program that either emulates CPM from
the command line to run CP/M programs or converts them to run
under MSDOS directly.   I think it uses the 8085 secretly,
but programs using the NEC V20 are avaiable to perform in almost
the same way.   The answer is - it can be done.  I don't know which
way you prefer or if there are PD solutions.

Cheers,

Subject: MEX1.65 Character Loss
Cc: rfowler@simtel20.arpa

 
The CP/M system that I use is an Apple ][+ and PCPI Applicard.  While 
developing a new overlay and PCPI driver using interrupts, to avoid the 
usual character loss at high baud rates, I have come across a problem 
which seems to afflict the Apple/Applicard even without interrupts and at 
1200 baud.  At this baud rate, I experience no character loss on screen 
during normal operation.  However, if I invoke a capture file, I do experience
character loss at the place where the capture buffer is being written to disk 
(in this case it is the Applicard add-on Ramdisk).  THis loss occurs both on 
screen and in the captured file and, typically may be half a dozen or so 
characters.  It seems that this bug has always been present in the MEX software
that I have used, though I had not noticed it because I don't usually capture
files as large as the capture buffer (16-17K).  Another local user has done a 
similar test with MEX1.65B and a non-Apple CP/M machine and the loss does not 
occur.  It does not, therefore, seem to be a basic problem with MEX.  If any 
Apple/Applicard user has noticed this before and has any clues about solving 
the problem, I would be interested to know.

Subject: Modem problems

I have recently purchased a SmartTEAM 1200AT modem.  The first unit I received
caused quite a few errors during file transfers, e.g. about 70 in a 40K file.
This was duly replaced by the supplier.  The new unit still gives errors,
though fewer (typically one error every 20K of file transferred).  I also see 
the occasional altered character on the screen.  I had previously seen good 
reports of SmartTEAM units.  Does anyone have any experience of this unit.  I 
am wondering whether to persevere and try to get another replacement or cut my
losses at this point.
                                         Gordon Marwood
P.S. The modem is connected to an Apple ][+ via a Super Serial Card, but I 
don't see that it is anything to do with the problem.  I have previously
used a USR Password 1200 and it is very unusual to get errors.

   There was always an interest in porting ZCPR3 to CP/M-Plus systems.  We
just never before saw any way to do it in a universal way (i.e., not a
separate port for each type of CP/M+ system) and without an enormous amount
of work.  Once Bridger Mitchell conceived a way to achieve a universal port,
we became highly enthusiastic about the project.  There are a lot of CP/M+
machines out there, and many of their owners have been asking for ZCPR3 for
a long time.
 
   I have not looked at CCP+, which I believe is a limited implementation of
an earlier version of ZCPR.  I suspect that ZCPR3 is a far more powerful
command processor than CCP+.  If nothing else, there is a vast array of
ZCPR3 support programs (history shells, alias processors, file maintenance
shells, and many more), and the number is still growing at a significant
rate.  The Z community is large and enthusiastic, and if it can join forces
with the CP/M+ community, we will all win.

Briefly, ZCPR3 is a highly advanced version of the CP/M command processor
that incorporates the best features of many other operating systems such as
Unix (nested shells, multiple commands on a line, named directories, flow
control commands, command search path, modular resident command extensions,
terminal independence via TCAP, extended command processors, alias
processing).  A good way to answer the question in more detail would be to
look in the SIMTEL20 directory with ZCPR3 files.  In particular, there
should be files containing the strings CONCEPT and USER.  These are Richard
Conn's ZCPR3 concepts manual and user guide.  They explain the concepts
behind the design of ZCPR3 and give many examples of its use.

If mex is "smart", it should be polling the modem input status between
each sector-write call in the flushing routine, and buffering any
received characters for "catch-up" processing when the buffer-flushing
is completed.  [Ron Fowler: does mex do this?]  But if not, it's
likely that characters are arriving at the modem port before the
buffer-flushing operation completes.  Unless the arriving bytes are
buffered before they reach mex, the first ones will be overwritten by
the later ones, creating a gap in the input stream received by the mex
software.

The real time required to flush a buffer is system-dependent, probably
dominated by the drive's step rate and the track number of the capture
file, and also affected by the CPU clock rate.  Another system with
faster disks, a faster cpu, or even a differently located file, could
have no lossage.  On your system, if you capture to a ram disk, for
example, there may be no lossage.

Many systems have 1-3 byte buffering in the UART chip that receives
the bytes from the modem; different systems use different UARTS.  More
buffering can be obtained by writing an interrupt-service routine for
the modem ports; only a few bioses have such support, but it may be
possible to write the mex overlay that way.

I could also use a Z80 assempler source.  I want to modify it to
handle the new Z280 instuctions and addressing modes.  If and when I
get it done, I will be glad to re-post it.

(Sorry if this is a re-posting.  It bombed for me the first time)

From the Internet, you can send mail to a user at a bitnet host using
the following:

	user%host.bitnet@cunyvm.cuny.edu

This is an interim solution; be alert, in the next few months, for
another change.

HNY to all!

After unsatisfactory results from one manufacturer's 1200 baud modem, I am 
now contemplating the purchase of a Packard-Bell PB1200 Plus external modem.
If anyone has any good or bad experience of this modem, I would appreciate 
their views on this unit.  I am unclear whether this modem has a programmable
S-register.  Can anyone clarify this ?
