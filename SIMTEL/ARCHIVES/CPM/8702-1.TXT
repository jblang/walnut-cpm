Hello All -

     I've got a controller (DTC-510A), a drive (Tandon TM-501), and
some idea of the hardware interface requirements... can someone give
me a pointer to a sample of a software driver to run under CP/M-2.2 ?
I'd like to avoid re-inventing the wheel if possible.

     For the curious, Xebec no longer sells their S-100 host interface
adapter and software package.  For other computers, yes.. but not
S-100.

Regards,
Mark

Subject: Intersecting Concepts
To: info-cpm@AMSAA-SEER.ARPA
Status:  N

I've seen some comments on the net about Intersecting Concepts ( creators
of Media Master and ZP/EM ).  Would-be emulators should approach their
products with caution.

A colleague of mine purchased their package to copy some WS stuff from
5-1/4 CP/M diskettes of unknown origin.  When he had troubles, he brought
them to me.  After trying full-track reads on his diskettes with my S-100
system (unsuccessfully), I surmised that they fell into Intersecting
Concept's category of diskettes written with "incompatible controller
hardware" and thus un-readable with their product.

In the meantime, I tried out three other diskette formats of known origin
with Media Master and ZP/EM in an attempt to determine what the problem
was.  The program would not read my Osborne or Wang OIS 60 formats, and
although the directory of a Columbia 964 disk came up (with incorrect file
sizes) and Media Master copied some very vanilla utilities such as PIP, ASM,
etc., the resulting files would not work with the ZP/EM emulator.  

Perhaps I hit upon some of their least-used formats, I don't know.  I can say,
however, that when I called them for help, they treated me with sarcasm and
disdain.  I can only assume that folks who react that way must be besieged
daily by angry and disappointed customers.  They finally agreed to send
another copy of the distribution diskette, but it produced the same results.

This whole incident left me with a VERY bad impression of the company, and
my friend with a copy of a $60. program that is worthless to him.  BE SURE
that you know it will work BEFORE you buy it from them.  You probably won't
find this vendor very helpful with problems.

In response to Andy Weaver's request for a version of MicroEMACS
for CP/M-86, the C Users' Group (Box 97, McPherson, KS 67460 (316)
241-1065) has two PD disks with MicroEMACS goodies.  One is C
source (#198) and the other is MS-DOS exe and docs. (#197).  The
exe works fine on the PC and Clones, so perhaps with a little bit
of work on the sources, MicroEMACS can function with CP/M-86.  At
$6. per disk, you can't beat the price!

Hello,
  I tried send to archive-request via UUCP. Explain: ...!ucbvax!simtel20.arpa!
archive-request. I am waited for files in approx 1 day and get requested files.
I couldn't believe that WISCVM gateways tie network too much. Today, I
received some requested files from archive-request. It took 7 days to
arrive! On friday, it modified to replyable-block. I had send to info-CPM
but it mailed back me. I was surprised that I received from
BITNET%"H462BATMS@GALLUA.BITNET" from arpanet instead EDU%"....@WISCVM.WISC.EDU"
That cause blocked some mail server to reply to bitnet sites. To work, use
UUCP mail until WISCVM has repaired. Sorry for you.
 
Last weekend, I tried to send netmail to archive-request and I get some
files from archive-request via UUCP. It works fine!
 
For BITNET users, use SENDGATE to send to archive-request:
      simtel20!archive-request@ucbvax.uucp or
      simtel20!archive-request@ucbvax.usenet to send request files.
 
or you can look in your archive blurb about UUCP.
 
Thanx,
 
Tim Stark

  I found some problems because I didn't receive any mails for a week from
wiscvm gateways but my mails works well. But replies failed back to bitnet.
I get mail from Info-CPM that I sent the same a week ago. I found that
Bitnet%"H462BATMS@GALLUA" instead EDU%"H462BATMS%GALLUA.BITNET@WISCVM.
WISC.EDU" that caused some servers am going to bomb out and failed requested
files to bitnet. Also other problems, someone shutdown two of three SMTP
gateways that cause blocked mails in arpanet area. If three SMTP is up,
it is work fine for arpanet is going back normal. I believe that
WISCVM get biggest problems that insults users in both arpanet and bitnet.
Sorry for you. try send to other gateways. Bitnet.gates is avaiable in
NICSERVE@BITNIC. Thanx. Please contact JULIE@WISCVM.WISC.EDU about blocked
messages because of shutdown two of SMTP servers: SMTPUSR1 and SMTPUSR2.
 
Thank for Arpanet SIG support! I have subscribe all of Info-CPM, Info-VAX, and

write a disk that can then be read by an Osborne Executive (or some
other ssdd cpm format?

Unless you own the unlikely combination of a C64 and a C1571 (not 1541) disk
drive, you cannot write a CP/M diskette for Osborne, Epson, etc.  The reason
is that the 1541 disk drive *cannot* write MFM or FM format diskettes as used
by virtually every other system except APPLE.  These drives write only a form
of NRZ encoding called GCR (Group Code Recording) - totally unreadable by
any other drive without special hardware/controller.  This was the basic
reason why C64 CP/M never seriously caught on - there was no way, other than
via modem, to get programs in or out!  And even with a 1571 drive hooked to
a C64, I know of no utilities written explicitly for the 64 to do the necessary
copy.

On the other hand, there are several public domain utilities for the C128 with
C1571 disk drive, which will copy files from normal CBM format to any of a
variety of CP/M formats, Osborne MFM being one of the defaults.  I believe
the C128 CP/M program RDCBM20 (see [SIMTEL20]PD:<CPM.C128>RDCBM20.LBR) would
be the easiest to use, and it does the necessary translation for text files
from Commodore character set to ASCII.  The latest Commodore FORMAT.COM
utility will allow you to format an Osborne diskette too (not sure about the
Osborne Executive though - maybe just the Osborne 1).

So if this conversion you require is a one-time process, beg or borrow a 128
to do the job.  The 1571 will read the C64/1541 diskettes just fine.

Sincerely,
Frank Prindle

I've just gotten delivery on the MIX C compiler for CP/M.  In several
respects it doesn't meet your needs...

	>it MUST create 8080-object code (NOT Z-80)
nope

	it must create ROMable code, separate DATA and CODE segments.
maybe

	>code must be able to run standalone, without the CP/M environment
no, or at least, not as such

	>it should be interlinkable with assembly language routines,

maybe, asm() calls are certainly there

...but I'm happy with it in almost all other respects.  It is a
commercial product, that runs right out of the box without apologies
or compromises.  It supports a number of function libraries for bdos
and bios calls; there's also an ms-dos version, so there are functions
for each.  It supports a FULL Kernighan and Ritchie C.  Compiles are
slow and it generates (to date) unimpressive code.  But it supports
everything: all data types, structures, assignments to structures,
enumeration, the works.  Comes with a few useful tools -- object code
speed or space optimizing, bin-to-ascii conversion.  Supports i/o
redirection from command line.

All in all a good buy at $40, everything works *so far*, and I can
recommend it as a user.  I have no relation with the company other
than as a satisfied customer.  MIX may be called at 1-800-523-9520, or
you can mail your check to 2116 East Arataho, Suite 363, Richardson
TX, 75081.

In light of the present transitory (I hope) difficulties with the Wisconsin
gateway between BITNET and ARPANET, it seems appropriate to ask:
 
    Are we demanding a little too much from the gateway?
 
I don't know the terms and conditions under which the WISCVM gate operates,
but I assume the improperly coerced "From:" address problem was not done
in malice.  At any rate, the gate is there and works, and generally works
well.  Can we help it work better?
 
How many Info-CPM members are on the BITNET side of Wisconsin?  Just
guessing, I would say I get 50 or so Info-CPM items per week. ...that
times however many of us there are over here I am sure represents a lot
of traffic through the gate.
 
Should we set up a single BITNET host as the redistribution point for all
Info-CPM traffic to BITNET-land?  As maintainer of my host and its mail
services I can offer RPICICGE for that function.  The redistribution
functions already exist; all that is needed is the mailing list....

I have not heard of a "new" FORMAT.COM before-- Where/how does one get it?
My 128 came with an old cpm version, and the FORMAT doesn't even do single
sided disks (the menu says it does, but...).  I presume that has been fixed,
too?

Message-ID:  <8702100831.aa18678@AMSAA-SEER.AMSAA-SEER.ARPA>

The C128 CP/M utility FORMAT.COM distributed with early 128s only did three
formats - all were GCR, all formated both sides of the disk (on a 1571), and
two of them marked the disk as single sided in track 18, sector 0.  The GCR
portion of the C1571 DOS just doesn't have an option to only format one side.
The only way to get a true "flippy" CP/M diskette formatted is to force the
drive into 1541 (aka "oh-so-slow") mode (send U0>M0 to the command channel),
then boot up (from a single sided system disk) and ask FORMAT to do one of the
single sided formats.  The CP/M diskettes distributed by Commodore are "flippy"
and not double sided because some masochist may be trying to run CP/M with only
a 1541 drive.

The newer FORMAT.COM (which I assume is being distributed with 128s now, and
on the new CP/M release,  8 Dec 85) will do the above 3, plus format a number of
MFM formats.  I got my copy off of either GENIE or COMPUSERVE, I can't remem-
ber which, a long time ago.  I will upload it to SIMTEL20 (where the rest of
the 6/8 Dec 85 updated CP/M software resides) with Commodore's permission.

Subject: re: re: c64 to CP/M

I got my C128 this past Christmas which had the 8 Dec 1985 release (at least
thats the date returned with no date set), but the FORMAT that came with it
only has a menu for 128-double, 128-single, and 64-single formats.

I can comfirm that 128-single also zaps 'side-2' on a 1571. I tried to make
a 'flippy' for a friend with 128 stuff on one side and CP/M on the other.
I did the 128 side first, then went to CP/M and formatted what I thought
was the 'other side'.  Luckily, I then went back to 128 mode to print
the directory (which I had forgotten to do) and 128 DOS was somewhat
confused by the disk.  Anyway, sounds like Commodore is still 
distributing the '2 1/2 option' FORMAT.COM.  Maybe the version from
GENIE and/or COMPUSERVE is an 'enhanced' version.

blug...
     I have a couple of TAB 1630 microcomputers that run CP/M 86 on 8
inch disks. The problem...no software to speak of. The machines were
donated to our institution without any applications software, although
I do have the system utilities, etc.
     If anyone knows the wherabouts of some cheap or free (pub domain)
languages, word processors/editors, that might run on our setup, please
let me know. I'd like to arrange to trade for disks. As far as format
goes, I can't even tell that, but I think it would be equivalent to
a DEC Rainbow. These TABs, which use 8086 CPUs, are so poorly supported
that not even the manufacturer knows how it is set up, nor does the
company seem to know where I can get a manual on it. (I called 'em up!).
     Your help would be MOST APPRECIATED. (P.S. I did find a big PD CP/M
catalog, but the CP/M 86 section listed very little, though I can get
Tiny C and a Forth from them.)

Recently I received a CP/M cartridge for the Commodore 64. I know everyone
would advise me to use a C-128 to do CP/M, but at the moment I have no money to
buy one. I got this strange problem: on some machines the cartridge works, on
others it doesn't. And every time the 64 hangs at an other moment, sometimes
after 1 asterisk (there's an asterisk for every sector that gets loaded during
a cold boot), sometimes after 3 or 4 (there should be 28 !!).
Does anyone know about differences between individual C-64's ??

Marc Wilson claims that the *newer* video chips work ok with the C64 CP/M
cartridge and the *older* ones don't.  It is my understanding that it is the
other way around, as I stated in my previous message: the CP/M cartridge works
fine with the *older* video chip, does not work at all with the *newer* video
chip.  I believe, as a result of this, the Federal Trade Commission ordered
Commodore to refund the money of anyone who ever bought a CP/M cartridge and
subsequently did not want it because it wouldn't work with newer 64s.

     There was a problem with early versions of the 64 and the CP/M cartridge.
It had to do with timing differences between the video chip and the Z80 in the
cartridge.  Newer 64's have newer VIC chips, and the problem doesn't show up.

     Your CP/M system may also be glitched.  Does the drive light blink when
booting?

The reason that the CP/M cartridge works on some 64s and not on others is that
newer 64s have an improved VIC II chip which produces proper NTSC video (the
old one had a bug and divided a clock by 64 instead of 65, or something like
that, which produced garbled color video).  The newer chip produces a slightly
different (1 or 2 percent) processor clock timing and the CP/M cartridge fails
to operate correctly.  The only cure is to use an older VIC II chip - if you
are using a Commodore 1701/1702/1802/1902 monitor with the separated video
input, the old chip looks as good as the new one.  Only the composite video is
screwed up.  Thus, if you have a friend with a C64 with the old VIC II chip but
no CP/M cartridge, do both of you a favor and trade chips with him - he gets a
better composite display if that matters, and you get a working CP/M cartridge.
The VIC II chip is the large chip to the left side under the metal "can" - it
has a blob of heat-sink compound on the top that a spring presses on when the
cover is replacd.

Subject: Re:  CP/M on the Commodore 64

The current issue of RUN (March 87) has a response to a letter to Commodore
Clinic on a different subject (problems with the ram expanders on early C128s)
which hints at a similar problem with the C64 CP/M cartridge.  The letter and
response are on page 92

The guy with the ram expander is treatening to sue or turn them in to the
Federal Trade Commission for false advertising.  The answer says that Commodore
had some trouble with the Feds over the C64 CP/M problem and promised they
would stop advertising products and
features not actually available.
Maybe you have some legal recourse if one of the C64s that won't run the CP/M
is yours.

You might even get Commodore to replace yours (but its doubtful) if you
threaten to bring this up with the FTC again.

Subject: C64 CP/M woes
Date:    Thu, 12-FEB-1987 06:53 EST
Header-Disclaimer: I don't like my headers either !
X-VMS-Mail-To: CPM

I was bitten by the same series of events that have been discussed
with the C64 cartridges.  I called CBM a couple of months ago and
they still offer full refunds for the price of the cartridge or
offer to swap an equal amount of CBM software; I protested and said
I just wanted CP/M to work - and could they sell me an old VIC-II
chip... and they said no, but confirmed the story Frank and the
others have retold here - but recommended strongly against such a
plan because it seems the CP/M cartridge is so fragile that they do
not guarantee that even the VIC-swap will work.

Frank, et.al.: how bad does the composite get ?  I have a very small
5" monitor (just bigger than Osborne-1 sized) in my portable CBM SX-64
(the ones liquidated by COMB) and use my composite all of the time to
augment that display... if it looses too badly I'll have to give up
on the cartridge maybe.  Opinions ?

Subject: MEX+ Keystrings


I should like to implement MEX+ softkey definitions to set up other key
definitions, e.g.  KEY K="KEY Q="QUIT^M"^MKEY O="STAT RUB OFF^M"".  The 
point of this is to set up MEX with customized softkeys when calling a 
particular remote system.  The problem is the "quotes within quotes" which
MEX cannot interpret correctly.  One solution would be to specify a LOAD
NAME.KEY within a softkey string, but that is slower and requires and extra
file to be maintained (NAME.KEY). Does anyone have any ideas how this 
problem may be avoided.  Specifying characters within the keystring 
definition with the binary /O option does not help.

TeX probably has no chance of fitting on any 8 bit micro. There are
commercial TeX's for MSDOS. The problem with porting the software
yourself is that TeX is a good torture test of Pascal compilers.  There
is also a C version. You can FTP TeX sources from score.stanford.edu at
off-peak hours.

The problem is not just porting TeX, you have to bring up the fonts and
device drivers. There is a lot of code and data involved. The Unix TeX
tape has 35 Mb of goodies.

Subject: Applicard Ramdisk

In the file Aplicard-review.1 (SIMTEL20 pd:<cpm.apple>, Rick Thomas suggests
that the Applicard can run a Ramdisk of up to "half a meg".  I am familiar with
the 128K (unformatted) piggyback cards for the Applicard and I use two of these
to give 222K formatted.  However, I have never heard of "half a meg" being
available.  Can anyone provide any information about this, please ?
    Also for the Applicard, I understand that a SIO piggyback board was also
produced.  Does anyone know whether this is still available and what the source
might be (ref. SIMTEL20 file PD:<cpm.apple>pcpi-sio.lbr.1).

For those looking for updated CPM for their C-128's, I have some hope.
I just read this morning in the most recent issue of COMPUTE!S GAZETTE
that Commodore is replacing the 128's CPM disk with an upgrade for $5.
Just make sure you have a complete copy of the original disk, and send
it with the $5 to Commodore to get the newest stuff.  I'm sorry that I
don't have the address at hand, as I didn't think I would be posting
this to answer the question as to how to get a CPM upgrade.  I plan on
sending mine in shortly, just to be sure I have up-to-date software.

I imagine (just guessing here) that the address given in the C-128 
manual for Commodore replacement of the CPM disk (should something 
happen to it) would be adequate for the above purpose as well.

does anyone know of a version of the wordprocessor TEX from D.Knuth
for CP/M 2.2 or MSDOS?. I understand there is a public domain source
of the program in PASCAL. Does anyone have it??
 
CAn someone tell me the difference between TYPELZ and the other programs
that axist to type, unpack?? crunched files (with extension *.?z?).

Keywords: speech chips
To:       info-cpm@AMSAA-SEER.ARPA


I got my B. G. Micro speech card the other night, so
here is a preliminary report.

The board plugs into an IBM-PC or clone, but takes
only power from the bus; you have to have a COM1 or
2 port that you can connect to the thing around back.

When I got it, I checked the baud rate, set it to 1200
for my system, and hooked it to my com port via a 
pin-for-pin cable, re-directed LPT to COM, hit control-P,
and it spoke.

And how well does it speak, this is the burning question.
Not that well.  I fed it some text files, and it was often
intelligible....but it fouls up an awful lot of common
words.  Like "files".  Just "file" sounds great, but
it pronounces "files" like "feels".  What it clearly 
needs is a filter prog in front of it that catches words
and massages the output.  Which brings me to the software
they supply.

It says COMPUTALKER DEMO DISK, and has a trivial example
of making an autoexec file copy a file to the COM1: port.
The only prog the have is called WORDLIST, and is supplied
in basic source and also .EXE compiled versions.
All this prog seems to do is allow you to make up a list
of words vs. what you really want to send to the thing
to sound like that word (eg. files -> file ss).  You
can save this list to disk.  But, as far as I can see, 
there is no way to use this list unless you write your
own prog to do it.

Physical Aspects:

The speaker mounted to the PC board is too high to allow
another board in the next slot; I took it off.  There is
a RCA phono jack on the back of the card in parallel
with the built-in speaker.  No volume control, but a place
for one on the PC board.... I reached into my drawer to
get a 10K pot & soldered it in (you don't have a drawer
like that? There's always Radio Shack...).
Since it does NOT interface to the PC bus, it would be easy
to use on any other system, if you could get the +5,+12 and
-12V somewhere (hmm.. I see the -12 coming in from the connector
on the schematic, but I don't see it going anywhere...
the +5 feeds the allophone chip and the text-to-speech chip,
and the +12 feeds the audio amp.)  By the way, the chips are
the General Instrument SP0256-AL2 allophone chip, and
the CTS256-AL2 code-to-speech chip, which has a built-in
UART.  There is also a 2K RAM chip for buffering the ASCII
stream, and a socket for an Exception EPROM you could
make to improve specific situations if you have the chip
data sheets.



Misc.

They supply a schematic, and about a page or so of notes..
but the chip details like you get from Radio Shack if you
buy the chips are not included.

If this is a duplicate, I apologize - our poster was broken.

A couple of months ago (November?), as I understand it, a shareware compiler
of mine, called Draco, was to be placed on the Simtel-20 archives. The only
mention of it on the net that I saw was something to the effect that the
standard librarian wouldn't unpack the libraries (apparently created on an
MSDOS system) that were used, and that that program was being fixed. Has
this been done? Has anybody used Draco? Any reactions to it, or to the
programs (screen editor, tools, adventure system, CRT games) that were
included in the package?

As near as I can tell, the quality of the package is on par with the
commercial compilers, so I had thought to hear something from someone.
(It's only problem being that it's not C, Pascal or Modula-2).

I'm finally breaking down and asking this because I'm getting close to the
point of having my Amiga version ready, and would appreciate any feedback
on the CP/M-80 version before I go ahead with it.

There is a wealth of public domain software available for the 
Robin and Rainbow systems on the public access DEC MARKET system, 
running TOPS-20.

Dial 1200 baud, 8N parity, phone 617-467-7437

login at the "@" system prompt with

LOG LCG.KERMIT KERMIT  where the second "Kermit" is a noecho password.

Carefully take notes, or have ^P turned on for the first screen, 
which shows how to get further help, and describes how to transfer 
files using KERMIT. XMODEM is not available as a downloading 
protocol, but MODEM/XMODEM sources are available.

Type out the AREAS.TXT help file for pointers to all the logical
storage areas.

There is also the "Robin Owner's Group" or ROG, which publishes a 
newsletter on a roughly quarterly basis.

I will claim to have worked for this company on this product, but don't
hold it against me.

The format for the floppy's are the infamous IBM 3740 format.
This is also the standard CP/M 8 inch format.  You can (or at least
could 2-3 years ago) get software that this box understands.  Computer
Innovation's C compiler used to work on it.  We had MicroPro's Wordstar
up on it (There was a mod to remap ^S/^Q to ^] and ^\ repectively).

The biggest problem in getting s/w for this system is that it runs
CP/M-86 which virtually died due to MS-DOS.

The reason that there is no support, is because the division that made
that family basically folded.  When you call Tab support, ask for EOP
(or what is left of EOP), they made the box.

Mail me direct if you want more info.

I have had the "problem" of typing "rm xxx" on our CP/M machine (by
mistake) as I would on a UNIX machine.  This was partially fixed by
making a rm.sub that passed the parameter line to ERASE.COM.  This
didn't really work very well because ERA isn't as flexible as rm.
So...I have written an (original) rm program that acts like rm.  It's
now available from SIMTEL20 as:

Filename			Type	 Bytes	 CRC

Directory PD:<CPM.DIRUTL>
RM104.ARK.1			BINARY	 15938  9BCBH

RM104 is a file deletion program for the CP/M-80 environment that
operates more or less in the style of UNIX (tm of AT&T) "rm".  Unlike
CP/M "erase", multiple filenames can be specified, and each can be
regular-expression wildcarded.  Further, it defaults into a verbose
mode, and can be run in an interactive query mode.  The plain '-'
option is for use with filenames that start with a '-'.

  Usage: rm [-f] [-i] [-q] [-] [s:]filename [filename...]

	        s: => Expand afn only with SYStem attribute files
		-f => Delete files, even if read-only
		-i => Interactive query before deleting each file
		-q => Quiet mode
		-  => Designates that filenames follow

The distributed compiled version of this program used the M.
Kersenbrock version of croot.c where the filenames are Unix-like
regular-expression (ambiguous) filenames.  See the documentation for
details.

The handling of "SYStem attribute" and "R/O" are those defined under
CP/M 3.0, although this program is also compatible with CP/M 2.2 .

The compiled binary, when run under CP/M 3.0, will set the system
error-status upon error to that value handled by the CCP105 CCP
replacement for "make" reasons explained there (if you use CP/M 3.0
and haven't replaced your CCP with CCP105, then you're working too
hard!).  This program (and CCP105 also) is compiled for Z80 only!

Subject: Response to Chris Gray's request for Draco feedback
Message-ID:  <8702190106.aa06865@AMSAA-SEER.AMSAA-SEER.ARPA>

In experience with Draco has been generally good--it has performed mostly
as described.  For the most part, it is a nice programming language.
I became interested in Draco because I have an application written in
FORTRAN that I want to release to the PD libraries.  It's a full screen
data entry/analysis type program that would be generally useful only if
terminal independent.  The Draco crt.lib looked promising.  In porting
that application, though, I have encountered a few shortcomings of
the package that I will share:
 
(1)  The compiler generates bad code for read(ptr*) if ptr is of type
     *ulong.  It adds an extra POP H / MOV M,E / INC H / MOV M,E that
     just doesn't belong there.  read(ulong), however, works fine.
 
(2)  In my application, most of the logic is decision table based.
     A GOTO would be damn convenient.  The While-loop and if-nests
     I'm forced to use now are quite overwhelming.
 
(3)  The lack of support for formatted input was a mistake.  Fixed
     format input does not belong in the stone ages; it is very
     appropriate for reading machine-generated data.
 
(4)  At one point I could have really used a floating type.  The
     compiler knows about float, but the run-time library does not.
     Can documentation be released about the internal representation
     of float and procedure linkage so we can develop our own float
     support?
 
(5)  BIGDRACO requires a 60K TPA, but does not check to see if it
     has it.  I have a 59K TPA (alas).
 
(6)  Is an open() to either a procedure or *char string cheap or
     expensive?  I need internal char -> number -> char conversion
     and wanted to avoid the overhead of repeated opens for each
     conversion.  The one-character-lookahead feature of read(),
     though, has been a problem.
 
(7)  Like most other support I've seen, the Draco crt library gets
     tailored of the particular terminal and this tailoring solves
     the problem of how to do output to the terminal.  Any thoughts
     on similar tailoring for input?  (E.g. choice of cursor keys,
     function keys, escape sequences....)  Any thoughts on special
     output rendering choices?  (E.g. "semi-graphic" type symbols
     to draw lines versus the typical - + and |.)
 
(8)  Given that Chris Gray has announced the very low probably of
     any continued support to the CPM version of Draco, would the
     author consider releasing the source?
 
 
(I have not, as yet, looked at any of the games, etc. so I have
no comments on them....)

The FIRST thing you do with any of these types of programs,

blown, the DU (or others) may not 'lock on' to the disk.
In this case, the recomendation is to put another disk
in the drive, have the disk utility 'lock on' then
swap disks and put the one to be saved in place.
	The DU program is not the most abuser friendly
however, if you READ THE INSTRUCTIONS, and PRACTICE,
things should go well.

In one of the messages displayed by FORMAT2.COM, there is a misspelled word

fine if your selling very large disks but i think thats terrible. 
 Does anyone with a similar setup have a solution for smaller groups.
Does anyone know if there is some restriction in microsoft apple cpm
or if this is just terrible software from novocomp. The documentation from
novocomp is muniscule and is not even translated well from german. HELP!

[sprong!]

I have a disk and two sectors have gone bad.
I get read errors (meaning that possibly the formatting was damaged).

I understand that there are programs to help me repair the disk.
	DISK DOCTOR - Who sells it?  Is it much better than DU?
	DU - public domain  (I'm getting a copy soon.
		Will I have to customize it a lot?)
	SPAT - public domain.  I have a copy.  It's useless without
		the specific system it was written for.

Since I plan to recover only the text files, I figure that I can
display all the good sectors, and like a puzzle, put together
the good pieces and combine those sectors to a 'good disk'
as one file.
Oh - this is a 5.25" double sided 80 track disk.
track 1 side 0 sector 3 went bad (directory!).
Looking at the other directory sectors would probably help
me find some files and narrow down the sector search.

Any helpful advise?

If you look at one of the "DRIVERS" lists on SIMTEL20  PD:<APPLE.CPM>
you will find reference to a PD driver for the CPS card.  However, the
driver itself is not in SIMTEL20.

I am in the market for an inexpensive RAMDISK card for my S100 system.
If anyone has one that they are interested in selling, or if you can
recommend a good source for "previously owned" S100 cards, please let

Hi. Does anyone have, or know where I can get, a program to copy files of any
size from a CP/M format disk to an MSDOS disk? I have one but the file size is
limited to ~40K. I need to copy a file around ~60K. I am running CP/M 3.0+ on
a Commodore 128. I prefer it to copy from CP/M format disks but will settle
for copying from CBM DOS disks. Any and all help will be much appreciated.

In response to the request for a program to convert from cpm disk to
msdos disk, I'll volunteer the short turbo pascal program I wrote to run
on a pc clone.  This program, running on an ibmpc, will read a cpm disk,
formatted by an Osborne (SSDD) and write in msdos format.  I haven't
tried it on large files, but since the source is pascal, it should
(hopefully) be easy enough to modify, if needed.

Sorry to be posting this to the net instead of a direct reply, but my
host couldn't determine the address for a direct reply.

(This is a repost of a previous request for the same thing, only changed
 slightly)

Hi. Does anyone have, or know where I can get, a program to copy files of any
size and type from a CP/M DS (such as Kaypro IV, for example, but I can read a
few others) format disk to an MSDOS disk? I have one but the file size is
limited to ~40K. The largest file I have is around 200K. I am running CP/M
3.0+ on a Commodore 128. I prefer it to copy from CP/M format disks but will
settle for copying from CBM DOS disks. Also, I need either binaries or ASM
source as I have no C or Pascal (or other) compilers for either IBM or CP/M.
Any and all help would be much appreciated.

There are several commercial programs that will handle conversion from
various CP/M formats to MS-DOS.  The best is probably UNIORM, by
Micro Solutions.  It will not only let you read/write/format a variety
of CP/M formats, but will let you read those disks in your MS-DOS
computer as if they were native MS-DOS diskettes.  Other good ones
are Media Master, and Xenocopy.  Note that for high density or single
density formats you need a drive capable of reading them, and double
ditto for 8" formats--usually you need a special controller (which,
for instance, MicroSolutions also sells).

One of the better s-100 ram-disk boards available is the 
LS-100 by Digital Reearch (Computers), Dallas, Tx.  It
was about $150. (in kit form) the last I knew.  They used
to advertise it quite heavily, but I don't think I've
seen an ad for it in quite a while.  It uses 4 banks of
64K DRAM and an 8203 memory controller.  I'll bet it is
still available.  Why don't you give them a call??  I use
two of them on my s-100, and have had very good luck with
them.  There's even an upgrade to 1 meg. available from
George Dombrowski Jr. (SYNC studios, 42 Pondview Drive,
Southington, Ct. 06489 (203) 621-6839).  It is too expensive
($275 for existing board or $495 for new) for my blood, but
it's there.  D.R. used to sell bare boards with documentation
and software for about $70, so that could be an option as
well.  I believe we work for the same organization, and I'd
be glad to help you out with this.  I've built one of their
kits, and a bare board!

I hope that someone out there in net.land can help me out with
a rather strange problem.
 
I recently purchased a Morrow MD2 single-board system (rev 2.0
Kojinsha), bundled with CP/M 2.2, MBASIC, and NewWord.  I am
quite satisfied with the system, except for one not-so-small
problem:  I can't get the second serial port to work!
 
Apparently, the IOBYTE is not implemented, so commands like
STAT PUN: = PTP: have no effect, and ctrl-p locks the system up.
The only way I can get the port to do anything at all is to
run KERMIT (configured for the Morrow MD1).  In KERMIT, I can
send stuff out to the modem with no errors, but the stuff sent
back from the modem to the Morrow is total garbage.  It appears
as if the receive characteristics (speed, word length, etc.) are
not the same as the transmit characteristics.
 
The port is an Intel 8251A, with clocking provided by an 8253.
Disassembly of the Morrow BIOS does not show any references to
the ports for the 8253, so the initialization of the baud generator
must be done in the boot ROM.  Also, KERMIT does nothing with these
ports.
 
Perhaps those of you who have experience with the MD2 can give me
some pointers on how to fix this problem.  Please reply to me
directly; I'll summarize the responses and post them to the net.

I would like to tell the USART in my Z-80 CPM machine to
send serial data with 1 start bit, 7 data bits, 1 parity bit, and
one stop bit.

	The initialization routine in my bios sends 0CEH to the serial status

	If anybody knows the other control bytes, mucho appreciado!

		Mode format - async mode

	0-1	Clock rate: 00 = sync mode, 01 = 1x, 10 = 16x, 11 = 64x
	2-3	Char length: 00 = 5, 01 = 6, 10 = 7, 11 = 8 bits

Bit #0 is the least significant bit; #7 is the most significant bit.

The mode byte for 1 start bit, 7 data bits, odd parity, and 1 stop bit
would be 05Ah (which includes the 16x clock factor too).

I know of two versions.  One is offered by Montezuma Micro and
costs about $150 (maybe a bit more).  The other is sold by Rose (or
something like that) and sells for about $80.
Supposedly, the MM version is a good bit "slicker".
Pick up an 80Micro to check out the prices.

To program the 8251:

The chip is programmed by writing a sequence of control words (bytes!) to the
control register.

1)  All programming goes to the same chip "address", so first you must insure 
    that the chip is in a known state.  One way to do this is a hardware
    reset, another is to write three "all zero" dummy bytes to the chip, and
    then a command instruction with the internal reset bit "one".  (This covers
    the case where the first two may be interpreted as "sync" characters.)

2)  Write a "mode" instruction to the control register:

	Assuming that you will use the chip in asynchronous mode:

	b7,b6 : stop bits : 00 invalid, 01 -> 1bit, 10 -> 1.5bits, 11 -> 2bits
	b5    : 0 -> odd parity, 1 -> even parity  (only if parity enabled)
	b4    : 0 -> parity disabled, 1 -> parity enabled
	b3,b2 : character size : 00 -> 5bit, 01 -> 6bit, 10 -> 7bit, 11 -> 8bit
	b1,b0 : clock factor : 00 -> sync mode, 01 -> 1x, 10 -> 16x, 11 -> 64x

3)  Write no "sync" characters, since I am assuming asynchronous operation.

4)  Write a "command" instruction to the control register:

	b7 : 1 -> enter "hunt" mode (only for sync operation, no effect here)
	b6 : 1 -> internal reset, next write will be "mode" instruction
	b5 : 1 -> request-to-send output will go active (note active low)
	b4 : 1 -> reset error flags: parity, overrun, framing
	b3 : 1 -> send "break" character (force transmitted data to 0)
	b2 : 1 -> receive enable
	b1 : 1 -> data-terminal-ready output will go active (note active low)
	b0 : 1 -> transmit enable

5)  now the chip should be working...

Therefore, for your requested parameters of 7 data, parity, and 1 stop:

	00000000 (sync) dummy sync if reading sync characters
	00000000 (sync) second dummy sync
	00000000 (command) dummy command
	01000000 (command) internal reset
	01111010 (mode) even parity or 01011010 odd parity, both 16x clock
	00100111 (command) example with both RTS and DTR active

I hope I got this right, and that it is the information you need.

Thanks everyone for the hints about the CP/M cartridge for the Commodore 64.
It really works! At first I was afraid it wouldn't, because people were talking
about NTSC and so and here in Europe we have another video-system, called PAL.
Also there were newer 64's that did work with the cartridge!
But I just exchanged the VIC's so everything works fine now.
I have another question:
Most files on ARCHIVE-REQUEST are send arc'ed, squeezed and/or uudecoded.
It takes a lot of work to download them and only afterwards you can see if
they're useful.
Is there anyone who knows a UNARC, LU and/or UUDECODE program to do it on
an VM/CMS system?
At the moment we have no C-compiler here, but if it's necessary this can change
..

I know of two versions.  One is offered by Montezuma Micro and
costs about $150 (maybe a bit more).  The other is sold by Rose (or
something like that) and sells for about $80.
Supposedly, the MM version is a good bit "slicker".
Pick up an 80Micro to check out the prices.

If you do find a PD CP/M, let everybody know.
Good luck.

Several Infocom games, including "Hitchhiker's Guide", are available
for CP/M-80 machines, but Infocom doesn't tell you this.

Many of us have stared longingly at Infocom's matrix of games vs
machines and despaired at all the blank boxes in the CP/M-80 line.
Many of those blanks correspond to filled boxes in the "Kaypro II"
line, meaning that those games are available for the Kaypro II
computer.  The Kaypro II is a Z80 based machine running CP/M-80.  I
wrote to Infocom asking whether I could run Kaypro II games on my CP/M
system, but they ignored me.  So I took a chance and bought the Kaypro
II version of "Hitchhiker's Guide."

Good news -- the Kaypro II package differs from a standard CP/M-80
package only in that the software (the .COM and .DAT files) are
distributed on a Kaypro 5.25" floppy, and the .COM file is
preconfigured for the Kaypro II environment; no configuration files are
supplied.  Neither the floppy disk nor the software are copy protected,
and an old configuration file from, e.g., the CP/M distribution of
"Zork I" will still work on the .COM file.  The only problem, then, is
transferring files from the Kaypro II disk to an eight inch disk, but
readers of these newsgroups should have little trouble finding
resources to accomplish this.  [Don't ask me for help, I relied heavily
on the kindness of friends.]

This information comes at an opportune time.  Infocom is discontinuing
many of their lines of machine support, including the Kaypro II, and is
blowing away these games for about $17, a much lower price than the
standard $40.  This sale ends on March 31, after which the software may
not be available at all.

I speculate that Infocom stopped distributing their games in CP/M-80
format because they wanted to stop supporting the eight inch disk and
the larger packaging that such disks necessitate.

Warning: I haven't verified that the Kaypro II software works on a
CP/M-80 system that doesn't use a Z80 processor.  I have no reason to
suspect it, but wouldn't be surprised if a Z80 is required.

Chris, have you tried a program called Uniform?  I am not sure if it will
handle Commodore disks, but it handles TONS of different disk type.  It
also supports 3.5", 5.25", 8", SS, DD, and QD drives...  It's truely
an amazing product!!  I don't know the name of the company that makes it
or their address or phone number, but here is the complete name of the 
software package:
 
                 Uniform-PC
 
So, maybe you can find it in a local computer store.  I have seen many
stores which carry it.  Be sure it reads your disk before you purchase
it (If you decide to buy it).  This is not the only software package
which does this, so be sure to look around..  Hope I helped ya out
a little bit, as well as someone else...

Subject: Applicard and Super Serial Card at 9600 baud

Does anyone have any experience of using the PCPI Applicard and Super Serial
card at 9600 baud.  I have tried this and found that a lot of characters are
dropped.  As the basic Super Serial Card in dumb terminal mode (working
totally in the Apple environment) does not seem to have this problem, I 
suspect that the difficulty arises because of slow communication 
between the Apple and the Applicard (in character rather than block mode).
One solution, if indeed this is the problem, might be to use the SIO board
which plugs directly into the Applicard.  If any one has any other ideas
I would appreciate them.
                                      thank you in advance

Subject: Re:  UnARC'ing and UUdecoding on the mainframe

There are some unix versions in 'c' source form at SIMTEL20
in the pd:<unix.*> directories.

For example 
	pd:<unix.utils1> 
		arc.shar1  \
		arc.shar2  | implement 'arc/unarc'
		arc.shar3  /
'shar' files are files which you can run thru 'sh' (after deleting
a few lines at the beginning, list one and it will be obvious) to
create the 'shared' files.  You could seperate the files by hand
with a half-decent editor.

Other files of interest are:

	pd:<unix.arc-lbr>lar.c		handles '.lbr' files
	pd:<unix.sq-usq>
		uncr231.c		handles '*.?Z?' files
		usq17u.c		handles '*.?Q?' files
		xusq107.c		same??

As I said these are in source form for unix. Don't know how much trouble
it would be to convert to VM/CMS.

I also don't know if there is a pd:<vms.*> collection at simtel20
which may have what you want in a native form.

Message-ID:  <8702260850.aa02931@AMSAA-SEER.AMSAA-SEER.ARPA>

The mode byte bits are as follows:
	Bits 7-6:	Number of stop bits
		00: invalid
		01: 1 bit
		10: 1.5 bits
		11: 2 bits
	Bit 5:		Parity type
		0: odd

	Bits 3-2:	Character length (not including parity bit)
		00: 5 bits
		01: 6 bits
		10: 7 bits
		11: 8 bits
	Bits 1-0:	Clock multiplier
		00: Sync mode
		01: 1X
		10: 16X
		11: 64X
Thus 07AH is the correct setting for Seven bits, even parity, one stop bit,
16X clock.  05AH is the same with odd parity.

Subject: Applicard and Super Serial Card
Cc: info-cpm@AMSAA-SEER.ARPA

Thanks for your comments re- the 9600 baud problem.  From what you say, it may
be impossible to run the Applicard at this speed, if the screen is going to be
updated.  I was thinking about two possible solutions, using a direct serial 
I/O from the Applicard bus or writing some sort of buffered driver for the
Super Serial Card.  Both of these would be fairly long term projects.  
However, if the screen is the limitation, the first solution may not work. I 
was also wondering whether some sort of block mode transfer to screen might be 
possible.  One line at a time would presumably be more efficient than the 
present one character at a time.  I have a ][+, so your other solution is not
possible.  I must use 9600 as I wish to be included in a group access to a
VAX, which for complicated reasons cannot use autobauding, and 9600 has been
chosen as the fixed rate.  
                                     Thanks again

Keywords: Colex-880 CP/M
To:       info-cpm@AMSAA-SEER.ARPA


I have found a Colex-880 CP/M machine for sale and want to know
if any one has any experience with it.  I have the following questions:
	Is it a good manchine?
	Are there any user groups, BBS's, or companies that support it?
	Is there additional software for it?
	Is MicroEmacs available for it?

I want to buy a CP/M machine to do assembly programming for a Z-80
microprocessor.  I am wanting to do hardware development using a Z-80.
I feel that the best way to do this is to have a host system to do
development on.  I like the machine because it is a STD bus machine
with two 800K floppies and it is cheep ($275).

Also can anybody recommend books on using CP/M and programming under CP/M.

Thanks in advance

I don't know about the machine you asked about, but I'm going to
stick my nose in and say that if that machine doesn't work out,
look into a used Tandy Model 4.  It will indeed run CP/M, and a
very nice version at that (Montezeuma Micro).  In addition, under
its proprietary DOS (LS-DOS 6.3), it runs **THE** best Z-80
assembler I've ever seen, called Pro-MRAS, from a company called
Misosys.  For an 'obsolete' machine, the amount of support the
Model 4 has has to be seen to be believed!!

After pulling out the current issue of 80-Micro and looking through it, here
are the available CP/M's for the 4p:
 
Montezuma Micro    $169   Hard disk driver, add $30
PO box 224767
Dallas, Texas 75222  USA
ph: 800-527-0347 (USA)
    800-442-1310 (Texas)
    214-631-7900
    This is the best CP/M I have seen for the Tandy Line
 
CP/M Plus is available from any Radio Shack, but is not very compatible
with most things.
 
Rose's cp/m is just a very old version of Montezuma Micro CP/M and is
somewhat limited compared to the new version.

Your problem is probably related to whatever driver routines you are using
to receive information from the card(s).  At 9600, there really isn't enough
time to do much with the data once you've got it (mainly due to the slow
6502 processing).  I've managed to transfer information at 19200 baud using
the super-serial card, but only if I do the processing myself in assembly
language and don't try doing anything related to printing on the screen
or writing to any other peripherals.

(you might be able to print on the screen using your own routines, but don't
try it using the normal apple-bios way, you'll loose characters every time).

What language(s) are you using for this?

Many of you sent me the data that I requested - thanks.

A most thorough description of the 8251 was provided by an article
called Programming the Intel 8251A USART, written by Ed Greenberg.
This article can be found in a file called INTE8251.ART on
SIMTEL20 (thanks again, Keith).

Recently I posted a request looking for a CP/M->MSDOS copier. In case anyone
else is interested in such a utility, here are the two which come most highly
recommended (yes, they are in order from 1st to 2nd most recommended):

Uniform
	- installs as device driver (a new line in CONFIG.SYS), allows
	  transparent access to CP/M files via a different drive code.
	- supports numerous CP/M formats except Apple
	- from: Micro Solutions
		125 S. Fourth St.
		DeKalb, Illinois 60115
		(815) 756-3411
	- price: $69.95-$79 (got too conflicting prices)

MediaMaster
	- available for a wide variety of micros.
	- transfer to/from a wide variety of machines/formats.
	- from: Intersecting Concepts
		4573 Heatherglen Ct.
		Moorpark, California
		93021
		(805) 529-5073 or
		1-800-824-7888 (oper 251) [24hr toll free ordering line]
	- price: ?

There were also a couple of others such as Convert and Big Blue Reader II
(BBR II runs on the C128, I assume, since BBR does) but I don't know too much
about them.
