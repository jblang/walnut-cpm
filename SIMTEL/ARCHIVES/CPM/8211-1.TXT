Regretably this will be my last sending to this mail list.
Indeed, even this one will cost me dearly.  I had over a hundred
"MAIL MEMO" messages tonight; all because the mail memo demon
--and demon it is--insists on telling me ALL about everyone on
the list who no longer gets mail.  I am weary of learning that
goldfarb doesn't get message and a copy is being returned.  Also
that--well, you get the idea.  A hundred of those is too many.

I suppose I will get this one back a dozen times; as I said, it
will cost me.

Surely there is a remedy?  But I do not know it.

I am pleased with "Micro Cornucopia" a journal devoted to the
"Big Board" CP/M system.  It comes out 6 times a year from
PO Box 223, Bend, Oregon 97709.  Subscriptions are $16.

Issues average about 24 pages with hardware and software hints
such as adding a RAM power supply protection circuit, configuring
MODEM7, disk drive jumper options, etc.

So far the 8 issues have all been on the original Big Board, but the
editor is building a Big Board II and I expect future issues will
have articles on both.

A good article on disk drive maintenance in No. 8 saved me
a lot of trouble.  I had a drive that would make errors
after about track 42. ... Turned out it had lost the
head load pressure pad!
 
Back issues are available at $3.

COPYFAST is a very useful disk copy program. It uses RAM up to capacity
to buffer data and has provision for installation using either direct
calls to disk controller firmware (a few implementations are present as
assembly-time conditionals) or BDOS calls. The latter option also permits
several alternative run-time behaviors such as copying system tracks only,
data tracks only, a specified range of tracks, etc.

Note that the program must be adapted to the number of sectors/track,
number of tracks, etc. for the target system and can be fine-tuned to
allow very rapid disk copying.

The answer to this is probably obvious, to those who know the answer.

What flag or field or whatever shows that a disk has been 'logged in'?
This comes up two ways:

     o Something used by BDOS to tell it to 'login' a disk and build a 
       directory check table and allocation table.

     o Some way for the BIOS to know that the disk drive has a new disk
       and it needs to be checked (i.e. density, format, etc.).  Obviously
       the BIOS doesn't want to do this everytime SELDSK is called.

I strongly suspect a word in the DPH table, but which one?

??????????

  tnx

I've started reading my mail using BABYL, and got someone to figure out
what it too to remove those blasted lines (BABYL already restructures
the headers), because at 300 baud they really get in the way.  Look at

About your 7E's...  it has been a while, but am pretty sure that 7E is the
opcode of the instruction your monitor uses to do the memory fetch,
probably a 'MOV A,M'.  I have had this before...  First I will explain
where I have seen it; I don't see a clear match with your problem,
but then I am not familiar with your hardware...

If you have a processor with no buffering, when you do the MOV A,M
the opcode (7E?) gets put on the bus.  When the processor does the read
the bus is tri-stated, and the opcode is still hanging around from
capacitance.  Since there is no memory out there, nobody drives the
bus, so you read the opcode.  If you have a running processor you
can see this by writing a memory poker that uses a different instruction,
like ldax b or d... then you see their opcode.

This certainly would not explain your problem with EI's etc.  Actually,
not much of anything would run since on the 8080 all jumps, ret, and
I think calls have the upper bit set.  Since you DID seem to get the memory
dumper of some description to run, it must not drop them ALL the time.

Anyway, good luck !    I hope this helped some...

	My bios CONIN has an option to enter a countdown loop when an ESC is
received.  If the next char is received within that time, it assumes both
the escape and the follow-on character were sent by a function key.  It then
discards the ESC and sets the high bit of the follow-on character to signal
the application program.  If it timesout without receiving anything, the 
ESC is presumed to have been typed as the escape key and is returned.
	You could have your editor patch in its own CONIN to do this while
it's running, then restore the bios CONIN on exit from the editor.
	The timing constant is based on the CPU speed and the baud rate for
the terminal channel and presumes that the follow-on character will be sent
by the terminal's ROM as soon as the baudrate permits.
	Let me know if you pursue this.  On reading Roger Long's message,
I see that this technique may need to be extended another character for
the 3-character sequences from the H-19 alternate keypad.
	A useful feature of this approach is that it allows the editor
to distinguish between ESC-char sent as separate keystrokes, and a function
key that transmits the same sequence.  This permits binding the function keys
to anything without conflicting with bindings chosen for the separate
keystroke commands.

        I am very pleased (yeah, and kind of proud since it WAS a
lot  of  work) to announce the release of SYSLIB for CP/M 2.2.  I
am sending this to both INFO-CPM and INFO-MICRO since SYSLIB  can
be used to create programs which run on ANY 8080 or Z80 microcom-
puter, not necessarily just CP/M, altho CP/M is  required  to  do
the assembly.

        SYSLIB is an extensive set of utility subroutines,  writ-
ten in 8080 assembly language.  There are over 130 subroutines in
over 70 modules in the library.  The following shows the scope of
the  library  by  showing you all the files which are required to
contain it and its documentation.

        SYSLIB is documented in two ways.  A 100+ page  user  and
reference  manual  exists  which tells you about each of the rou-
tines and gives you 7 sample programs which you can study to  see
how  SYSLIB  is used.  Additionally, 13 HLP (for use with my HELP
program for online documentation) files are available which  con-
tain the same information the routine description sections of the
user and reference manual contains.  You  can  effectively  index
into  the  user  and  reference  manual  quickly by using the HLP
files.

        A second, following message which  is  much  longer  than
this one has been prepared to tell you exactly what SYSLIB is and
does.  This was done so that those not interested in SYSLIB  need
not read thru all of the basic description information.

	M80.COM, L80.COM, and SYSLIB.REL are required to do SYSLIB
programming.  All the other files are source and documentation.

        Information on the files making up SYSLIB follows:

              SYSLIB -- An Integrated Library of Assembly Language
          Utility Subroutines for use with the Microsoft M80 Assembler


        1.0  Introduction

        1.01 What is SYSLIB?

             SYSLIB  (SYStem LIBrary) is a collection of over 130 subrou-
        tines which are designed to provide to the CP/M 8080/Z80 assembly 
        language  programmer a set of functions upon which he  can  build 
        his programs.  This library is intended to relieve the programmer 
        of  the task of frequently "reinventing the wheel" and to provide 
        him   with  an  tool  environment  which  encourages   structured 
        programming at the assembly language level.

             Each  subroutine within SYSLIB can be viewed as  a  reliable 
        "black box."  The subroutines in SYSLIB are completely documented 
        within  this 100+ page manual and the SYSLIBx.HLP files,  and the 
        programmer  is consistently provided with the following  informa-
        tion:
                  1.  Name of Subroutine
                  2.  Function it performs
                  3.  What its inputs are
                  4.  What its outputs are
                  5.  What registers are affected by it
                  6.  What other library routines it calls upon
                  7.  What errors can occur and how it handles them

             The routines within SYSLIB are designed to work together and 
        complement  each other.   Parameter passing is consistent between 
        the various subroutines; for instance, all routines which need to 
        be  passed  a  pointer to a File Control Block  are  passed  that 
        pointer in the DE register pair.   Also,  as a general rule, if a 
        register is not returned as an output from the SYSLIB subroutine, 
        then  its value is not affected (it has the same value  when  the 
        routine is exited as it had when the routine was called).

             SYSLIB  itself  is a library of relocatable  object  modules 
        created  in  the Microsoft M80 relocatable  object  format.   All 
        subroutines within SYSLIB are grouped within functionally-related 
        modules.   Once  a routine is referenced (by the EXT statement in 
        the M80 assembly language program),  its module is loaded and  it 
        is  available  to the programmer by means of a simple  subroutine 
        call.   All  other subroutines within that particular module  are 
        also loaded,  but they are not available to the programmer unless 
        he  has also referenced them by EXT statements.   The  module  is 
        loaded  only  once,  regardless of how many routines  within  the 
        module  are referenced.   For this reason,  I have designed  each 
        module  to contain routines which are frequently used together or 
        are  called  by each other (one routine within the  module  calls 
        another routine within the module).

                        SYSLIB User and Reference Manual



        1.02 What is Needed to Use SYSLIB?

             You  need an 8080- or Z80-based microcomputer with at  least 
        48K  bytes of contiguous memory running CP/M 2.2,  the  Microsoft 
        M80  assembler tool set (specifically,  the M80 assembler and the 
        L80 linker),  and the usual set of software development tools (an 
        editor and, preferably, a debugger) to use SYSLIB.



        1.03 What Does SYSLIB Buy Me?

             The bottom line is that,  to the experienced SYSLIB program-
        mer,  SYSLIB has the potential of being a significant tool  which 
        enables him to:

                  1.  Solve his programming task quickly
                       -- because  he spends less time writing  com-
            monly-used subroutines and worrying about how his regis-
            ters  are  affected by these subroutines and  more  time 
            concentrating on the problem at hand

                  2.  Write space- and speed-efficient code
                       -- because  all  of the SYSLIB routines  have 
            been gone over time and time again to reduce their  size 
            and  make  them more efficient in terms  of  speed;  for 
            example,  the  SORT routine is a Shell Sort that can  be 
            called to perform the sort using pointers (in which case 
            it  exchanges pointers rather than records when it needs 
            to do a swap) or perform the sort without using pointers 
            (when space is a factor and there may not be enough room 
            for a pointer table)

                  3.  Write more maintainable code
                       -- because SYSLIB is designed with structured 
            programming philosophy in mind; each subroutine is equi-
            valent  to a process box,  having (1) only one  entrance 
            and one exit,  (2) a precisely-defined function, and (3) 
            a precisely-defined set of input and output  parameters; 
            having  used  SYSLIB for some time now,  the author  has 
            noted that his programming thought processes and program 
            designs  have tended more and more toward  end-in  (top-
            down from the objective point of view and bottom-up from 
            the SYSLIB subroutine point of view), structured designs 
            that  he  can  go back to at a later  date  and  readily 
            decipher and modify

                  4.  Reduce the programming effort
                       -- because  SYSLIB provides a number of  very 
            involved routines which would, in themselves, take quite 
            some  time to code;  for example,  the DIRF routine will 
            load the directory of a disk into memory,  select a  set 
            of  files  from that loaded directory as specified by  a 
            File Control Block and a flag which indicates whether to 
            include System or Non-System files and what user area is 
            to  be examined,  packs the loaded  directory  (removing 
            entries not selected from the memory buffer),  alphabet-
            izes  the directory entries by file name and type or  by 
            file  type and name,  and returns a pointer to the first 
            entry and a count of the number of entries selected


             In many ways,  SYSLIB brings some of the advantages of  pro-
        gramming  in  a High-Order Language,  like C or  Pascal,  to  the 
        assembly  language  programmer.  It  allows him to  maintain  the 
        smaller code size and greater efficiency which can be realized in 
        assembly  language programming and simultaneously realize  a  re-
        duced  life-cycle  cost  (from development to fielding  to  post-
        fielding  maintenance  and modification) over  assembly  language 
        programming without a SYSLIB-like tool set.



        1.04 How Do I Assemble with SYSLIB?

             Each  example in Section 21 of this manual shows an assembly 
        of the sample program.   I frequently use a command file, which I 
        call M80.SUB,  to assemble my programs.   This command file takes 
        only one parameter,  the name of the file to be assembled WITHOUT 
        its type (MAC is assumed).  Warning:  The command MUST be:

                                SUB M80 filename

        and it MUST NOT be:

                              SUB M80 filename.typ

        If  it  is of the latter form,  the source code will  be  deleted 
        during the assembly process!  You may wish to remove the

                                   ERA $1.BAK 

        command in the M80.SUB file to eliminate this problem.  I only do 
        this for a space savings.

                        SYSLIB User and Reference Manual



             My M80.SUB command file is:

        ;  M80.SUB -- MACRO-80 Assembler and Linker
        M80 =$1
        SUB /A  PLEASE ABORT IF ERROR(S) EXIST
        ERA $1.BAK
        ERA $1.COM
        L80 /P:100,$1,A:SYSLIB/S,$1/N,/U,/E
        ERA $1.REL
        ;  ASSEMBLY COMPLETE

             I run ZCPR2 instead of the CP/M 2.2 CCP,  and I am always on 
        Drive  B:  doing  my  development  work,  while  my  editors  and 
        assemblers (and SYSLIB.REL) are on Drive A:.   Note that this  is 
        reflected in M80.SUB, where L80 looks for A:SYSLIB for the scan.



        1.05 How Do I Learn to Use SYSLIB Effectively?

             This is, of course, opinion, but I feel that the best way to 
        learn how to use SYSLIB would involve the following steps:

                  1.   Study  the  SYSLIB manual in an overview  fashion, 
        familiarizing  yourself  with the functions  of  the  subroutines 
        available

                  2.   Study in some detail the sample source programs in 
        Section 21, jumping back to the main body of the manual from time 
        to  time to see why the routines I selected in the programs  were 
        used in the way I used them

                  3.  Try coding a couple of the routines in this manual, 
        copying them verbatim and assembling them

                  4.  Try making up a few simple problems of your own and 
        use SYSLIB to code them

                  5.   Apply  SYSLIB to a significant program you want to 
        write

             I am a strong advocate of writing programs in order to learn 
        how to program,  and I feel that it is most important to (1) gain 
        as  much familiarity with the SYSLIB routines as you can and  (2) 
        to write programs using these routines.

Via:  Brl-Bmd; 4 Nov 82 19:46-EST

	XDIR3, complete with its installation program (XDIR3INS) and
its HLP file, are now ready for distribution on MIT-MC.  Keith will let
you know where the files are when he is ready.

	Some documentation on what XDIR3 is and does follows:

                        Overview of XDIR3

     XDIR3  is an extended directory display utility designed  to 
run  under CP/M 2.2 and support some of the extended features  of 
ZCPR2 as well.  Any conventional CP/M 2.2 user may use XDIR3, but 
he  should make sure he turns off the ZCPR2-specific features  by 
running  the XDIR3 Installation Program,  XDIR3INS,  and manually 
turning them off before using XDIR3.

     XDIR3  automatically  adapts to any Org-0 CP/M  2.2  system, 
regardless of the size of its disks.  It reads the disk parameter 
block information from the operating system to determine what the 
attributes  of  the  disk it is working with  are,  and  it  then 
presents its display information accordingly.

     XDIR3 runs in two basic modes:
          . as a directory display utility
          . as a file scanner utility (File Name Buffer Facility)

     XDIR3  is a ZCPR2 utility which supports the extended  ZCPR2 
features, particularly named directories.

     As   a  directory  display  utility,   it  displays  to  you 
information  about  the files on a particular disk in  all  or  a 
particular user area.  It gives you the following information:
          . Name of File
          . Size of File (in K bytes)
          . Attributes of File (R/O or System)
          . Sum of Sizes of All Files Displayed
          . Total Number of Files on Disk
          . Amount of Space Remaining on Disk
          . What Disk and What User Area you are looking at

     As a file scanner utility, it does the following:
          . Logs a group of selected files to disk for later scan
          . Prints the contents of such a log file
          . Scans a log file and compares it with the files
               selected by you, telling you what files are
               missing and what files are additional

     XDIR3 is quite human-oriented,  with many built-in  features 
which  provide  a  human-interface type of service to  the  user.  
Some of these include:

          . Named Directories may be specified
          . The file listing is alphabetized by file name and
               type or file type and name, depending on user
               preference
          . The file listing is organized vertically or
               horizontally, depending on user preference
          . Output may also be send to disk or printer
          . XDIR3 is designed to run quickly, having an optimum
               design in its directory load and sort modules



                 Basic Use of XDIR3 under ZCPR2

     XDIR3 is invoked by one of the following command lines:

          XDIR afn oooo... or XDIR afn /oooo...
and
          XDIR /oooo...

where all elements after the XDIR command are optional.

     'afn'  is an ambiguous file reference,  as described on  the 
following frames.   'o' is an option letter, which is one or more 
of  the options described on the next frame.   Note that since  a 
slash denotes that an option follows, an afn may not begin with a 
slash.   This  can be changed by an equate in the source code  of 
XDIR3 if desired.


          Aa - Set the attributes of the files to be displayed
               a=S for System Files, a=N for Non-System Files
               a=A for All Files (Non-System and System)
          D  - Send Output to Disk
          Ff - Engage File Name Buffer Facility
               f=L to Log File Names to Disk
               f=P to Print Names Logged to Disk
               f=S to Scan Disk for File Names and Compare to
                    Log
          G  - Toggle Grouping (group files by name and type or
                    type and name)
          H  - Toggle Horizontal or Vertical display format
          I  - Inspect files selected by FL option
          N  - Negate Selection; select those files which do NOT
                    match the ambiguous file name
          P  - Send Output to Printer


     'afn' is an ambiguous file reference, of the general form:

          dir:filename.typ

where
     filename.typ   is a conventional CP/M ambiguous file name
                         (wild card characters of ? and * are OK,
                         but file name must NOT start with /)
     dir:           is a ZCPR2 directory specification, which may
                         be one of the following forms:
          d:        where 'd' is a disk letter (A-P) to indicate
                         the current user area on that disk
          u:        where 'u' is a user number (0-31) to indicate
                         that user on the current disk; 'u' may
                         be a '?', in which case all user areas
                         are selected
          du:       where 'du' specifies both disk and user
          name:     where 'name' is the name of a directory
                         (disk/user area)

I have uploaded files to AR47:CPM; at MIT-MC that permits users
of North Star CP/M vers 1.1.0 to have two additional floppy disk formats
on 5 1/4 in drives.  North Star supports Octal (N drives) in that version
but with 4kb directory blocks.  I have added an additional format that  gives
2kb directory blocks.  Additionally, there is an alternate format provided
for Quad drives (doubleside,doubledensity) that permits 80 tracks vs the
North Star 70 track support.  You can intermix diskettes and drives for
the North Star supported formats as well as these (except for obvious
physical constraints).

The main file is NEWFRM 11ASM which patches into your system with DDT
(after assembly).  Use GENSYS 41COM instead of your SYSGEN program to
write the patched system to your system tracks.  Also get the formatter
and copier, NEWFMT COM and NEWCOPY COM to work with his system.
GENUSR 45ASM is an extensive patch file that incorporates many user
features including an extended CCP - and has the two new disk formats
already built into it.			enjoy

I left out where the routines are at this time is because Keith (w8sdz)
is trying to find a place for them at this time.  Everyone will be
informed when they are placed on the net.

	For the time being, the library itself, the HLP files, and (I hope)
the user's manual will be placed on MIT-MC.  The source code, being so
huge, may not necessarily be placed on MIT-MC, but it will be showing up
in the SIG/M disks.

	I've found a very good source for Control Data disks. A box
of 12 5-1/4" (or 10 8" disks) costs only $19.90... There is a $3
P&H charge for 1 to 4 boxes, and a $4 charge for 5 or more (no
limit). They are error free, have a 1 year warranty, and come with
hub rings installed. I ordered a box, and they arrived promptly.
They seem like good disks. I haven't given them extensive tests
yet, as I've just recently gotten them, but none of them have
zonked out (I've had that happen to me with other brand new disks).
Overall, it seems like a good deal. For all interested in trying
some, here are the phone numbers that were listed on the sheet:

1-800-521-5700 (Everywhere but:)
1-800-482-4770 (Michigan)
  313-557-3036 (Detroit)
  312-992-0076 (Chicago)
  614-221-1788 (Columbus)
  513-621-1518 (Cincinnati)
Telex: 810-224-4646
(Yes, I proofread the numbers, and there are no typos (any more))

Well, I must terminate this messagge, as my rabbit, Spike, is
nibbling on phone cord, and I must chase her out of the room...
"Share and Enjoy."

We are currently debating as to if the source should be placed

Whenever I attempt to do sequential I/O in text mode with JRT Pascal, I
am unable to read a character at a time.  Whenever I read 1 character, the
next character returned by a word request is the first character after
the next space.  Thus, two read requests on the string "THIS WORD" in
a file would return T and W.

The same code on another system produced "THIS WORD".  Any fixes?

Hi,

I have the Morrow terminal on loan for evaluation and I am
trying to configure it for WordStar.  Documentation is very
sparse.  I have it configured as an ADM-31, which was the
way it was configured in a local computer store.  Are there
any special patches that should be made to wordstar to make
the thing work right?  Any patches to anything else...I am
using 3.0 of wordstar.

Thanks in advance,
David

I was discussing a small documentation problem with the JRT folks in San
Francisco via telephone last week.  Upon completion of the main part of
our discussion, I mentioned a rather nastily worded rebuttal to the
benefits of JRT Pascal which was contained in last week's Infoworld.  It
seems that under certain circumstances JRT Pascal could not correctly
multiply a number times zero and come up with zero.  I was immediately
provided with the fix.

Use DDT on EXEC.COM.  Change an "ED" (echo delta) code in location 563C
(five six three charlie) to "EB" (echo bravo).  After exiting DDT, then
savethe modified version with SAVE 90 EXEC.COM.

I have little experience (so far) with JRT Pascal, but am learning slowly.
I have found the JRT people to be very helpful in the three conversations
that I have had over the last six weeks.

Hope this helps,
Bud

The hitch is, the data path must be 8 bits wide.  That is, all
8 bits must be able to be transmitted from the computer to the
printer.  Has anyone done this?  Any advice?

Via:  Brl-Bmd; 8 Nov 82 20:27-EST

Alan,

        No, I don't like to get into the  distribution  business.
If  I  do, I end up spending all my time copying files for people
and not getting any work done.  That's why we use MIT-MC like  we
do.  The designer does not have to spend a lot of time doing such
tasks, and those who want the files need only make the investment
in time to get them.

        SIG/M, who will be receiving all of SYSLIB, is set up  to
do  the  copying for you.  Their charge, if you supply the disks,
is only $1/disk, and the money goes to the Amateur Computer Group
of  NJ to support SIG/M and club activities further.  They charge
$4/disk if they have to supply the disk.  Typically, you have  to
be a club member to use SIG/M, and this costs only $14/year, and,
with ACG-NJ being over 1100 members strong and putting out a very
nice 20-page newsletter every month, I think it is well worth it.

        The ACG-NJ is also a major sponsor of the Trenton Comput-
er  Festival,  which  typically is held in April and includes a 5
acre flea market and many talks by various people in  the  micro-
computer community.  Sol Libes, who has a monthly column in Byte,
is a very active member of the ACG-NJ, and the festival also  in-
cludes talks by him and others, such as Gary Kildall.

        The club is by no means devoted to CP/M,  altho  all  the
SIG/M  disks  are.   The following user groups are present within
the club:

                SIG/M, CP/M
                TRS-80
                SIG68, 680x
                Apple
                PET
                6502
                North Star

as well as the following software libraries:

                SIG/M
                North Star
                TRS-80 Disk
                Apple

and special interest groups:

                Pascal
                1802
                Heath
                POLY-88
                S-100
                Atari
                IBM-PC

        If you wish to find out more about SIG/M and the  ACG-NJ,
the address is:

                Scotch Plains, NJ  07076

        I greatly perfer SIG/M to CP/M UG because (1) it  is  de-
finitely  a not-for-profit organization and you don't end up pay-
ing a company for public domain software and (2) the  prices  are
much  more reasonable.  The ACG-NJ will ship the entire SIG/M li-
brary (now up to 75 8" disks) to any  valid  computer  club,  and
they  may  distribute  to their members absolutely free of charge
(which is the way public domain software SHOULD  be  handled,  as
opposed to selling it, in my opinion).  All the computer club has
to do is pay for the disks.  SIG/M has a published  catalog,  and
their  disks include, among other things, the old CP/M 1.4 SYSLIB
and ZCPR1.

	One thing I forgot to mention about the ACG-NJ:  they frequently
put together group purchases on things, such as disk drives, disks, etc,
and with 1100 members, if you get 1-10% involved, you have a LOT of buying
power, which frequently results in very nice prices.

I have found the answer to my initialization problem.
It seems that the morrow terminal acts like an adm-31, with a
single exception...the row and column cursor commands are reversed.

By making a patch to a designated address in wordstar, this
problem was reasonably avoided.

Thanks,

When to (physically) log in a new disk?  I've been using CP/M for
6 years now, and haven't seen a good answer.  My new system, a US MICRO
XOR (S100-12) system [side-note: excellent system, literally "plug it
in and run", well worth the $$] has a BIOS which does disk format
selection as follows:
   Upon warm-start, each disk is marked "unaccessed".
   The first time a disk is used (from the BIOS's point of view),
a "format-check" operation is performed: track 0 sector 1 is read: this
will *always* have 128 bytes -- and the last byte is checked for format
information... E5 means SSSD 8", 1A means SSDD 8", etc.
   Unfortunately, the log-in of a disk from the BDOS's (and hence the
program's) point of view is seperated completely from the BIOS login;
so if you insert a new disk and do a BDOS(RELOG_DISK), the BDOS will
note (for its use) that this is a new disk, the block-table must be
recomputed, etc.  The BIOS never hears of this... if the disk formats
don't match (see program SWEEP, for instance), the system tends to
die when accessing is attempted.  This is an inherent flaw in the
way *this particular BIOS* was designed -- I've seen BIOSs which
use the timeout-overflow standard to check for disk format change.
   How did I get around this?  I haven't, yet.  I have planned out
a solution, and will implement it when time allows.  The solution is
rather hacky, some of you out there may appreciate more than I:
I assume that when a new disk is inserted, the first operation will
be one which accesses the directory, starting at the beginning.  This
may be a directory search, DIR, file-open, whatever.  So every time I
go to do a READ, I check the TRACK/SECTOR combination to see if it is
the combination which means "beginning-of-directory".  (This can be
precomputed for any and all disk formats based on the DPB.)  If I
*am* seeking the begin-dir., I over-seek to track 0 sector 1, read it
in, and double-check the format.

   If this seems overly gross to you, try instead this:  trace out in
the BDOS to find the sequence of operations performed to login a disk...
at some point, it will mark the disk (in the BDOS logged-in vector)
as "unused" -- insert a call at this point to your routine in the BIOS
which will perform the same operation, keeping its own version of
the LOGIN_VECTOR.  Then, when SELDSK is called, check it and....

Ain't CP/M wonderful?  Isn't the concept of multiple-densities well
handled?

	We, the Computer Science Undergraduate Association (CSUA) of the 
University of California at Berkeley, are launching a hardware drive
to acquire equipment to provide the students of UCB with a varied
computing environment.  We are a part of the Associated Students of the
University of California, and as such are a non-profit organization.
We would be happy to write out a receipt for any and all computer
equipment donated to us so it can be claimed as a tax exemption, and
provided the equipment is received before the end of the year, it can
be claimed as a deduction for this year.

	We are in need of terminals, lineprinters, modems, disk drives,
and any other peripherals.  We would accept any type of computing
equipment, ranging from a Vax 11/780 running VMUnix to a 6800 system
running Flex.  We would also accept just the PC boards, or a full system.
Anything would be greatly appreciated.  In addition, we would especially
like to acquire 16 bit processors capable of running Unix, since almost all
the students here program on Unix systems.  

	If you or your company can donate equipment, or if you know someone
who might be able to help us, please reply to:

	The directory JCAF; on MIT-MC contains the following files:

		MODEM 781ASM
		MODEM 781COM
		MODEM 781HEX
		MODEM 78LIB
		MODEM 781HIS
		MCNFG 781ASM
		MNUM  781ASM

This version of MODEM7 has not been put in AR61:CPM; since Keith is
going to upload another version for me to combine with the present
version. In the meantime some of you may want to use this version.
A description of the changes follows:

;11/10/82  Combined MODEM771 and MODEM780 as follows:
;
;	     1. Used erase file function in 780,
;	     2. Used 780 code to make display of error count start at 1
;		 and changed display to decimal,
;	     3. Used 780 idea for throttled output on terminal mode
;		 transfer of text file to remote but wrote new routines
;		 including one for user to set speed,
;	     4. Moved disk reset to DIR routine as in 780,
;	     5. Used 780 code to give kbytes free on DIR command but
;		 modified to give kbytes free on requested drive instead
;		 of default drive.
;
;	   Made the following changes:
;
;	     1. Eliminated IMSAI front panel routines,
;	     2.	Changed so PMMI control-D (disconnect) checks for file
;		 open on returning to menu mode,
;	     3. Fixed file display on bulk transfer so that spaces are
;		 eliminated and period is inserted if required,
;	     4. Changed M(enu) to H(elp) command,
;	     5. Added code to allow echo mode to use optional toggling of
;		 send linefeed after carriage return,
;	     6. Added toggling of Checksum/CRC modes on file receive,
;	     7. Added optional code to clear to end of screen on next line
;		 from current cursor position when returning from terminal
;		 mode, this eliminates jumbled screen when working remote
;		 which positions cursor.

The BDOS asks the BIOS to log in a disk by passing a flag in the E register
when calling SELDSK.  As to how the BDOS knows that a log in is necessary,
I can only surmise that the directory checksum is verified before any disk
write, but I have nothing with which to back that up.

My thanks to Ben Goldfarb for pointing out the secret.  An undocumented feature
in BDOS provides that the LSB of the E-register is a 0 if this is the first
time (i.e. after a cold or warm boot) that SELDSK has been called to select
the disk specified in the C-register.  Calls for a disk which has been 
previously logged in all have that LSB set.

I have found the answer to my question about the morrow terminal.
To correct some confusion however, it was not information about
how to install things into wordstar, but the peculiarities
of the morrow terminal.  The thing came with no documentation at
all, so all of the control sequences had to be worked out by trial
and error (and a call to Morrow).  Thanks for all the help.

You are absolutely correct.  The CBIOS in the Micro Decision is

In response to your message of 12 Nov 1982 1628-EST

Either I misunderstand your question, or the answer is much simpler
than Steve's suggestion.

Whenever the BDOS calls the SELDSK entry of BIOS, it supplies
its idea of whether the drive is new. Bit 0 of register E is a 1
if the drive is already logged, and a 0 if it's new, as determined
by the "logged disks" vector. So your BIOS should check that bit
and do any needed setup only when the bit is zero.
So if you go through the warm boot routine (by typing ^C)
when you change media, you're all set. If you're trying
to detect changed disks WITHOUT a warm boot, I can't help you.

Re:   when to log-in a new disk?

   Steve, your BIOS should relog a disk whenever its SELDSK entry is
called with a 0 in the E register; this bit is actually the "login
vector"
 rotated such that the requested drive's bit is in DE
least-significant-bit. This is not documented in the system Alteration
guide but is supported for all SELDSK calls in both CP/M 2.x, MP/M II
and CP/M III (so I'm told).  If DR had bothered to mention this in the
original documentation, disk-relogging problems like this would never
have come about.			--Ron

  In fact, once accessed, a disk is considered logged until the
next warm-boot, even if it has changed.  The bit passed in E is
actually the login vector rotated such that e reg bit 0 has the
requested login vector bit.			--Ron

The secret of running MODEM2 and MODEM7 at high baud rates is to use
the "Q" (quiet) mode option.  This prevents the console status
messages from being printed.  It's that delay that causes it to fail.
If console status messages are never needed, consider XMODEM.  It
ALWAYS runs in the quiet mode, which is nice because you don't have to
remember to type that option.

Put your density check routine in the CBIOS "HOME" routine.  CP/M does
a "HOME" (usually translated to a track 0 seek or "restore") before
doing directory operations, in order to assure proper re-calibration
of the drive.  If this works for you, please tell Info-Cpm.  If not,
tell me.  Thanks.

	Really now, modem7 isn't quite as bad as it has been made out to be
in a recent flame to this list.  While a size of 52 sectors might be
considered a bit hefty by some, its advantages far outweigh its bulk, even
when one is limited (such as I) to 241K bytes per disk.  I use it every day
as a remote terminal and especially for file transfer.  While I am aware
that older versions had their problems, I find the the latest (modem770+) work quite 
nicely.  The user interface is improved with each version, allowing 
on-the-fly and initial setting of a variety of parameters that allow provide a
customized version.  In addition, it is very easy to tailor for any sort
of 8080/Z80 hrdand communications hardware.  The only machine dependancy in`then    
the code is the data/status port number and the receive/send bit number.
It handles CRC/checksum, wild-card file transfer (eg. *.*), dir and era
functions.  It has an on-line phone number library and provides a total
environment as opposed to modem2 which is a one mode-per-sho-per-shot deal.
I have been able to transfer from an IBM PC running modem2 to a Z80 CP/M
machine running modem7 at 9600 baud using a null modem cable.  I did not
even need to use quiet mode.

**DISCLAIMER**
	I have been somewhat involved in the development and testing of
the most recent versions of modem7 and can be expected to be somewhat
partial to it.  While not overly familiar with the code I have used most
of the options and find that they work as advertised in the online menu.

My view of JRT is that it is worth $29.95 but not much more.
The error messages are not Pascal and the language is not
Pascal; and the eextensions are not all that good.  But that is
my view, and perhaps I'm wrong.

There is a well-defined (though perhaps not documented; I forget) way
for the BIOS to know about BDOS disk resets.  When the BDOS calls
SELDSK, bit 0 of E is 0 if the BDOS thinks the disk is being accessed
the first time, else 1.

Dear Mr. Beals,
  In the course of the past 5 days, you have transmitted the following 
three letters across the 'net.  The first was to me personally, the latter 
two CC:'ed to the entire INFO-CPM community.  The tone existing in each of 
the three letters is, in my opinion, not befitting to the mature group of 
individuals sharing these resources.
  I take personal offense to the first letter:  it (my letter) was in 
response to a request for information;  admittedly I was wrong, out of my 
own ignorance  (I have used CP/M and similar OS's for quite a long time, 
but had never had the actual need to use this particular feature).  As to 
the first letter:

    i've been using modem2 (orig wc version) at 9600 baud VERY reliable
    for 6 mos now...your problem is that modem7 is a toatal crock
    of <insert your favorite obscene noun here, mine has to deal with

    -------

They further indicate a total lack of tolerance of anything different by 
yourself;  in fact, you seem to desire to aggresively destroy anything you 
you are not currently enraptured with.  Such an attitude is not conductive 
to harmonious existance, nor towards the development and propagation of 
knowledge and information.  (I know for one, if you were to put out a 
request for information or some product I had written, I would hesitate to 
answer, knowing that if it does not fit YOUR purposes exactly you might 
very well proceed to describe it to others as... well, I will let the 
latter two letters speak for themselves.)
  In summary, Mr. Beals, I can only say that I hope you were having an 
"off" few days when these letters were written and sent; and I hope you 
will be more considering of your actions in the future.

Tom,

The CP/M assembler business IS somewhat confusing  with  all  the
similar  names  and different capabilities for the various assem-
blers out there.  Here is a  quick  summary  which  I  hope  will
answer some of your questions:


ASM (I call it ASM2) -- this is the  assembler  that  comes  with
CP/M  2.2;  what  I call ASM is the assembler that came with CP/M
1.4, and the major difference is that with ASM,  quoted  text  is
always  capitalized  while  ASM2  allows lower-case to pass thru;
ASM and ASM2 have no macro capability, but do support conditional
assembly, SET, and a few nice operations in the operand field

MAC -- this is DR's upgrade to ASM and ASM2 (DR=Digital Research,
who wrote CP/M); this is basically the same assembler, but it can
use macros and macro libraries; it still generates just HEX files
as output

M80/L80 -- this is Microsoft's assembler, which is used to assem-
ble  programs  requiring SYSLIB; M80 is the assembler, which sup-
ports nice features found in MAC, such as  macros,  AND  supports
relocatable  libraries (which MAC does not); the output of M80 is
a REL file, NOT a HEX file, and this output  is  then  passed  to
L80; L80 can take a number of REL files and put them together and
generate a HEX or a COM file or both; M80 also supports both  In-
tel  and Zilog mnemonics, while MAC and ASM/ASM2 just support In-
tel mnemonics, altho there is a Z80  macro  library  which  comes
with  MAC  to allow you to assemble for the Z80-specific instruc-
tions, but does not allow Zilog mnemonics

Other assemblers are available, but these are the main ones I use
and  know  about.   I use M80/L80 for most of the ZCPR2 work, but
MAC is required to assemble ZCPR2  itself  (and  ZCPR1  for  that
matter).   A  big difference is that MAC allows longer names than
M80 (M80 is limited to 6 chars in my version).

Hope this helps.  Feel free to write if you still have questions.

Rick

	I am looking for a file management package accessible from 
a language like C.  Ideally, it would consist of individual loader
modules which could be linked in with an application written in C.
It might also contain separate command language modules.  It would
be nice to have the source available, particularly if it is C code.
A package close to what I am looking for is BT-80 from Microsoft.
This package supports b-tree record indexing, however it is written
primarily for use with PLI/80, which is required for running BT-80.

As interest in such a package has been expressed by several people
I have contacted, I will summarize results of any replies which
are made directly to me, however I think the topic is of broad enough
interest to be discussed on-line.

Thanks for any information,
	Bill (RIZZI@ISIB)

	I feel that I must warn potential purchasers of the disk buffering
program called Cache/Q that it has serious bugs and is an unacceptable
product in my opinion. This program is currently being heavily advertised
in Infoworld. The bugs I found about 8 weeks ago are that the feature of
specification of file type to buffer does not work (it is an all or nothing
choice now) and even more seriously, the author forgot to include a
BDOS disk reset upon warm boot. The result is that one cannot switch disks
under the buffering program. It appears that development was performed on
a hard disk and there were no beta tests using floppies!
	I have spoken to the author at least four times since I discovered
these bugs and have gotten a different excuse each time; my next (and
last verbal effort) will be for a request for the source code so I can fix
the problems myself, an immediate replacement or a refund. I am not
sanguine to say the least.
	The design of the program, which allows the use of bank-switched
memory (a nice feature) is to buffer on a file rather than a track basis -
a big mistake.
	I see in the latest Infoworld ad that Tecne Software will be at the
L.A. Computer Showcase Expo Nov. 18-20. Are there any souls
interested in calling this guy on the defective software he is peddling?

	I have uploaded the file CPM;NOCLR C to MC.

NOCLR contains a function called noclrex() which is used
to perform a hack on programs like CHDIR, when compiled with
version 1.50 of the BDS C Compiler.  IT appears that Leor's
newest version has the runtime system (C.CCC) clear out the
external data area before actually executing the compiled
program.  

Now this is all well and good for nearly all of the programs
written.  One program that does not work well when the externals
are initialized is Rick Conn's CHDIR.C program.  What CHDIR does
is create directory names and place them in tables that are
external variables to the compiler.  When the user is done entering
names, CHDIR writes itself back out to disk, including the external
data, so that the next time it runs, it is already initialized.

The problem is that when a compiled program is run, before any
of the user-written code is executed, it performs a number of
initializations, including clearing external data.

NOCLR is used to cause the run-time package to skip the stage
where it clears the external data by poking a jump instruction
into memory.  When CHDIR is executed initially, the external
data is cleared.  The, when noclrex() is called, a jump instruction
is used to bypass the segment that clears the externals.  Finally,
when the program is written out with changes, this bypass is left
in so the externals won't be cleared the next time through.

Because some people do not like to have their programs hacked up
and because this only affects those using version 1.5 of the 
compiler, I have not made any changes to CHDIR.C.  SHould
you need to bypass the phase that clears externals, simply
poke a JMP XXXX into the runtime space or use NOCLR.C.
A call of noclrex() early on in the program (any time before
write-out) will solve the problem.

If, for some reason, it doesn't work, check the addresses in NOCLR
and C.CCC.  My version of C.CCC comes from a pre-release version
of BDS C 1.5 and may not be the same as yours.

Finally, I would appreciate it if someone would move NOCLR to
a proper archive directory.

Enjoy,.

CACHE/Q I never tried, but MicroCache from England looks to be
an excellent cache system making use of bank switch memory.
MicroCache works essentially invisibly and can be as small as a
few K or up to about 8 megabytes for cache memory.  Naturally
the thing most often accessed is kept; with small memory that is
likley to be the directory of the disk most often written to.
Even then it speeds things up nicely.

        Sorry about the inconvenience with CHDIR.  I have  really
considered  the  need  of  CHDIR to write itself back out to disk
somewhat of a cludge, and have already designed a new CHDIR which
runs in the ZCPR2 environment.  Am really hoping to get ZCPR2 out
before Christmas, and, unlike ZCPR1, ZCPR2 is coming with a whole
set  of  utility programs (probably 30 or 40 before I'm finished)
which are intimately linked to each  other.   CHDIR  and  CD  are
parts  of  the  heart of the system, and CHDIR now creates a file
containing the directory names rather than storing them internal-
ly.

        The reason for this is that ALL of  the  ZCPR2  utilities
will be supporting a named directory structure, based on the file
created by CHDIR.  Examples:

                XDIR JEFF:*.COM

                ERASE ASM:*.TMP,MYWORK:*.ASM,HELP:*.*

                MCOPY BACKUP:=WORK1:*.SRC

        As you can see, ZCPR2 offers quite a  difference.   Also,
anywhere  you  can  use  a  named directory, you can also use the
disk/user form:

                XDIR B5:

        For those considering using CHDIR, you may wish  to  wait
until after the ZCPR2 release.

Does  anyone  out  there  know of any IBM 3270 Terminal emulators
that can be used with the Apple II+ micro (either with CPM or DOS
3.3  or  Apple Pascal operating systems)?  I would appreciate any
information or leads you may have.

Thanks.

Does anybody have software for converting an 8080/z80 assembly
language program between CROSS and Microsoft-assembler syntax?
(Both directions are needed, although either will be useful.)

	The following describes recent changes:

;11/18/81  Combined 11/10/82 and 11/11/82.
;
;	   Made the following changes:
;
;	     1.	Added optional routine to overlay file to clear screen
;		 and home cursor on paging of menu etc.,
;	     2. Changed printer toggle to terminal mode command and made
;		 optional with overlay file,
;	     3. Changed routines to set MSPEED when changing buad rate with
;		 SET command,
;	     4. Added more information to display of current settings
;		 and used calls to save space,
;	     5. Fixed and shortened bytes free routine,
;	     6. Shortened and separated LIB SENDTIME routine into two parts
;		 so that it can be used in display of current settings,
;	     7. Made echo mode part of normal terminal mode to save space
;		 and make all terminal mode commands available in echo mode,
;	     8. Fixed PMMI BYE routine so that it works with overlay file,
;	     9. Eliminated F command as redundant, DIR FOO (where FOO is a
;		 nonexistent file) accomplishes the same thing.
;								;P.L.Kelley


;11/11/82  Made the following changes:
;
;	     1. Fixed PMMI dialing routines,
;	     2.	Added menu command to display current settings
;		 including bytes remaining in memory buffer,
;	     3. Added menu command to change default drive,
;	     4. Added menu command for local echo in terminal mode,
;	     5. Added menu command to toggle printer on/off,
;	     6. Fixed PMMI BYE so warm boots.
;							- Irv Hoff

;11/10/82  Combined MODEM771 and MODEM780 (F. Gaude) as follows:
;
;	     1. Used erase file function in 780,
;	     2. Used 780 code to make display of error count start at 1
;		 and changed display to decimal,
;	     3. Used 780 idea for throttled output on terminal mode
;		 transfer of text file to remote but wrote new routines
;		 including one for user to set speed,
;	     4. Moved disk reset to DIR routine as in 780,
;	     5. Used 780 code to give kbytes free on DIR command but
;		 modified to give kbytes free on requested drive instead
;		 of default drive.
;
;	   Made the following changes:
;
;	     1. Eliminated IMSAI front panel routines,
;	     2.	Changed so PMMI control-D (disconnect) checks for file
;		 open on returning to menu mode,
;	     3. Fixed file display on bulk transfer so that spaces are
;		 eliminated and period is inserted if required,
;	     4. Changed M(enu) to H(elp) command,
;	     5. Added code to allow echo mode to use optional toggling of
;		 send linefeed after carriage return,
;	     6. Added toggling of Checksum/CRC modes on file receive,
;	     7. Added optional code to clear to end of screen on next line
;		 from current cursor position when returning from terminal
;		 mode, this eliminates jumbled screen when working remote
;		 which positions cursor.
;								;P.L.Kelley

;11/02/82  Shows the time to send a file.  (Routine was placed in
;	    MODEM791.LIB).  Set MSPEED to the speed you normally use.
;	    Currently set at 300 Baud.  Can reset at any time using the
;	    menu.					- Irv Hoff

;10/20/82  Made the following changes:
;
;	    1. New 'F' command shows free disk space on default drive
;		and resets drive to prevent R/O errors when attempting
;		to upload to default disk.
;	    2. Requesting DIR also shows free disk space and resets the
;		current drive. (From F. Gaude's 780).
;	    3. Heading automatically tells if set for PMMI Modem or not.
;		(Previously always indicated it was PMMI-only.)
;	    4. Grouped all TRUE/FALSE statements together.
;	    5. Put 'PMMIBYTE' immediately after ORG 0100H.
;	    6. Increased checksum timeout to original value (10 seconds)
;		to agree with CRC timeout.  This should allow adequate
;		time for slow disk systems to write.

can anyone tell me about what i should do in the way of diagnostics
when i actually open the box that a new computer comes in?  it seems
there should be diagnostics that could give the system a workout
BEFORE marginal components fail when out-of-warranty.  any suggestions
for (a) home-programmed tests, (b) diagnostic packages, (c) hardware
diddling, (d) anything else?  how long should these things be run?

also, what is the "recommended" factory burn-in time for components in
testing?  clearly 200 hours is better than 48, but how much better?

i'll post answers to the list.

thanks.

I'm looking for certain information on GODBOUT/COMPUPRO systems...

(1) is there error-correcting circuitry available? (or parity checking?)

(2) they market an 8086/8087 board, but they claim that the 8086 is restricted to running at 5 MHz "with the 8087", vs. a 10 MHz speed without it. 

	(a) how come?

	(b) does this mean that the simple existence of the 8087
	inhibits 10 Mhz operation, regardless of whether the 8087 is actually
	in use, or can the 8086 run in 10 Mhz mode while the 8087 is either
	not in use or somewho disabled?  can it be disabled at all?

(3) can the 8087 be accessed while running 8 bit software?  For
example, if I had a fortran program wanting to do number
crunchingwhich was running on another card (e.g., their CPU Z card),
could I get at the 8087? Or is the 8087 a 16 bit job?

(4) how does the 8087 work anyway?  does the cpu see it as an I/O
device, or what?

(5) can anyone recommend a good hard disk (preferably with an
integrated tape back-up) which runs well with Godbout/Compupro
controllers?

(6) I've seen a few ads specifying particlar all-Godbout/Compupro
configurations, but for my needs, none of these are just what I need.
Does anyone do custom integration by mail?  if so, are they reliable,
etc...?

I will share all replies...

many thanks.

These files are from Mike Karas' article in Lifelines of a couple of months

reducing the TPA size. Note that RMAC, LINK, and DISKDEF.LIB (from the CP/M 2.2
distribution disk) are required for assembly.
If there are any souls out there brave enough to modify the program to
use bank switched/extended addressed memory, please do so! This would be
a significant contribution to the public domain CP/M world!

      In fact, once accessed, a disk is considered logged until the

Not strictly true.  There is a "Reset disk subsystem" BDOS call that
will un-log all disks without warm booting.

The 8087 is a co-processor.  When the 8086 want to do floating point
operations, it uses the various ESC opcodes.  The 8087 reads this
from the bus, and by watching the status lines of the 8086, is able to
determine when tey are executed.  It then can read an operand from the
bus (which the 8086 fetches and discards durring the ESC operation).
I dont know wgether the 8087 can also control the bus itself, but I
assume it must (otherwise  it would take several ESC instructions
to load a full floating point number...)  All this means that there
is little chance of getting at the 8087 from another processor.

Presumably, the 8087 will only run at 5MHz because is is not as far
along the learning curve as the 8086.  The first 8086s were 5Mhz too.
Due to the above outlined tight coupling between the 86 and 87, they
must both run at the same clock speed.

	Has anyone had any experience with the LU program set with
libraries over 256k?  It seems to be fouling up somehow on the directory:
some directory programs report a file length as (true length) mod 256K.
	I've modified the filefind program so it searches ALL 4 or 16 drives
of a cp/m system rather than ending at the first non-existent drive --who
should this be reported to?
	I feel that dirty linen like the recent message set between PLATT
and BANDY ought not to be aired; I'm not taking sides -- I just feel that
I have better things to do then listen to this nonsense.  If you object
to someone's behavior, say so *privately*, or ignore it.  The only saving
grace of twits is that they *eventually* go away if you ignore them.  If
you just can't take it, then remove the name from the list or take some
other pointed action.  End of flame.

As far as I can tell, G & G Engineering is the best Godbout
integration house around.  They seem to know there stuff when
it comes to system integration.  Since they have Compupros
stamp of approval for integration work, it seems that they
may be what you want.  I spoke with them once and was
impressed by their knowledge.  (however, they have grown
considerably in the half year since then).  For your information
they are in San Leandro and San Francisco CA, in the 415 area.
I believe that their ads are in a number of the trade mags.  I
also believe they will do stuff by mail.  

Be forwarned however, they are not cheap.

Good Luck,

Mabey files loaded to the CPM directory should be squeezed before
sending them to MC.  Doing this would increase the speed of transfers
to and from the machine as well as decreasing the ammount of
disk space taken up by these files.

	Files in CPM; should be compressed.

Please dont.  Some of us like to look at the program/whatever
BEFORE we download it, if it ever gets downloaded at all.  I
frequently run a program from CPM though a translation process
and assemble using a cross assembler...  It is particurally
annoying, for example, that the documentation for SYSLIB, which
is applicable to more than just CPM systems, is essentially
unusable without a rather specific cpm environment. (Not that
Im complaining - beggars can't be choosy!).  The ideal solution
would be to write versions of SQUEZE/UNSQUEZE for various large
computers (it might even be useful in its own right!).  For
example, does anyone have it running under UNIX (this should
be relatively easy...).

For those of you who may not be aware, other than various varieties of
MODEM, we have several other utilities available for the CP/M hacker
for use on certain mainframes:

Ian Mackey's CRC - the ITS and TOPS-20 equivalent of Keith Petersen's
CRCK.  Contact GREN@MC for availability of the sources, written in
MIDAS.

Gail Zacharias' COMIFY and HEXIFY, which convert HEX files to COM
files, and vice-versa.  Contact GZ@MC.  Sources are also in MIDAS as I
recall - for ITS...

As the space availability on MC:CPM; dwindles, and as Bill Westfield
points out, utilities such as mainframe versions of SQ, USQ, and TSQ
would certainly be welcome additions to the mainframe world in their
own right.  And UNIX machines do not hold a monopoly on C compilers...

Another vote for NOT squeezing files on MC;CPM...AT THIS TIME.

Reason against:  It has the unfortunate feature of turning text files
into binary files, which a still large number of us are not set up to
handle.  It is already a problem with the .COM files on MC;CPM.  Many
of them need to be .COMs, because of space requirements; but then the
 .HEX unloaded version is needed too, taking up even more space due to
the duplication.  Not to mention needing some kind sole to unload the
files each time.

Possible solution:  A mechanism for performing the UNLOAD function on
the MIT machine.  This would allow the transfer of binary files, both
 .COM and .xSx types, by anyone; in the more efficient binary form  if
the user had the capability, as clear text if not.  An alternate sol-
ution would of course involve UNLOAD programs for the remote sites,
with the advantage of improved ARPANET transmission times, but  would
then require a large and diverse number of such programs.

Mabey files loaded to the CPM directory should be squeezed before
sending them to MC.  Doing this would increase the speed of transfers
to and from the machine as well as decreasing the ammount of
disk space taken up by these files.

It is a nice idea. But, unfortunately, I, and perhaps many
others, would not be able to transfer squeezed files. I am only
able to grab text files intact, and need non-text files Hexed,
which, of course, takes up time and room. However, as long as
there are helpful people who don't mind requests to hexify some
files, I won't mind too much.

Via:  Brl; 21 Nov 82 14:30-EST
Via:  Brl-Bmd; 21 Nov 82 14:57-EST

A friend is considering buying a Model II system but wants to run CP/M
instead of TRSDOS.  I am aware of Pickles & Trout's CP/M for that
machine, but there are some things I don't like about their
implementation (such as not providing source for the CBIOS, putting
serial number checks into several of their utilities which makes it
almost impossible to use ZCPR because it has no serial number, etc).

Is there another source for CP/M 2.2 for that machine?  Alternately has
anyone solved the problems I mentioned above?

As I mentioned in my previous message, there are several mainframe
implementations of MODEM, and there are two working versions that run
on TOPS-20 machines: Bill Westfield's MODEM and Max Diaz' XMODEM.
Sources to both are kept in MC:AR60:.  MODEM works on TOPS-20 only and
also works through an ARPANET connection using a TIP or TAC, NCP or
TCP.  XMODEM works on TOPS-20 direct only, and on TENEX either direct
or through an ARPANET connection using a TIP or TAC, NCP or TCP.

Downloading using either program works at any speed.  Uploading works
at any speed in direct mode, and through a TIP up to 1200.  TACs have
an inherent design flaw (a fixed-size 64-byte input buffer) which
prevents or severely inhibits uploading at speeds greater than 300.

Both uploading and downloading using either program properly handle
both text and binary files, including those binary files uploaded to
MC via LMODEM which contain a special header word as the first word of
the file to indicate that it is a binary file since ITS sites do not
have FDBs to indicate file type.  Thus, you should no longer need
files in HEX or text-only form unless you cannot FTP from MC.

Note to UNIX sites: UMODEM is available and does work with both text
and binary files in your environment.  The trick is to get FTP to
transfer the binary files correctly...someone else can tell us how
they do that.

Further comment on SQueezed vs text vs binary files: binary files are
stored as 4 bytes per PDP-10 36-bit word; text files are stored as 5
bytes per PDP-10 word.  Storing a text file as a binary file takes up
25% more disk space.  Squeezing that file first yields a typical 40%
reduction and takes up 15% less disk space.  That 15% helps, but that
alone is not quite enough justification - converting several files to
Library format is.  The reason: each file takes up directory entry
space, limiting the combined total amount of space for both the files
themselves and the directory entry space.  By packing several related
files into Library format, already a binary file at that point, and
then SQueezing the resulting file, we can make *much* more space
available for the many files which should have been uploaded by now
and haven't, due to that space crunch.

I can appreciate Bill Westfield's desire to leave text files alone so
that he can manipulate them online, but that is a luxury we can no
longer afford.  The principal intent of a CPM directory on MC is to
have a repository for public domain files of interest to the CP/M
community which they can, in turn, download to their micros by
whatever means available to them.  At first, uploading and downloading
was limited to those who had access to MC.  Since then, programs like
Bill's own MODEM have sprung up to provide similar capabilities to
other mainframes.  I suspect that it won't be too long before someone
converts SQ, USQ, TYPESQ, and LU to mainframe versions of those
utilities we have found so handy on our micros...

There are a number of CP/M implementations for the Model-II.  Briefly, (and
in my own humble opinion):

o  P&T -- I agree with your complaints, but feel that theirs is the best
	overall product for the price.  The provide very good documentation
	(a rare bird indeed).  They support a variety of disk drives, both
	hard and soft.  They provide a good supply of useful, well written
	utilities.  And they provide good customer support (except for certain
	policies like not providing source).  Only one other complaint;  the
	double density disk format they chose is a little strange, 16 sectors
	of 512 bytes  (most use 15 x 512).  This does provide more storage
	than others, but is very hard to read on other machines.

o  Lifeboat -- The other current major supplier.  Not as good an implementation
	as P&T, and with the usual Lifeboat support (one customer I know of is
	still waiting for an answer to his question after 2 years!).  Does
	support 8 x 1k disk sectors.  

o  CPU SHOP and FMG -- sold a lot of copies early on, but have mostly faded
	away, at least as a CP/M Model-II supplier.  More expensive.

o  ATON -- one of the best jobs of fully utilizing the Model-II hardware that
	I have seen.  Only a little more expensive.  Fair documentations,
	actually quite good for a hacker, not near as good as P&T if you are
	a business turnkey type.  The ATON version(s) support disk caching
	through extra memory cards, and also concurrent operations using
	multiple banked memory cards.  I have no direct experience running
	the system (called JOBSTREAM), but careful review of the manuals
	makes it look like it was done by a hacker who knows his way around
	a system.  ATON has only had it out a few months.

Conclusion:  I'd still go with the P&T.  Most products now support it (Word-
	star, dBASE, etc.), where some of the other implementations may require
	some effort to install application packages.  [Side note:  the P&T
	makes full use of the CRT capabilities, much better than Lifeboat]
	I am recommending P&T to those who ask me; and using it as a base
	for a Model-16 or Model-II Enhanced CP/M-68K implementation.

The actual release version of v1.5 (which still hasn't been finalized) will
have a new CLINK option which inhibits the clearing of external data, like
Dave Gewirtz's NOCLEAR program does.
I'll probably be sending a "final" v1.50 to the User's Group for general

Re:   diagnostics for new computers, fresh out of box

Sudden infant mortality is surely a very common occurrence in the
microcomputer field. Memoery tests are very useful; the best I have
seen is called the Rasmussen Memory test (MEMR2) from Lifeboat and is
most likely available from them for a modest fee. There are also a
plethora of public domain memory tests available in the public domain
and they are generally useful for "hard" errors only; I have seen
several instances of bad memory where the mory tests insist that all
is well. Those that exercise the memory at full speed are the best.
Look at one called WORM and another called UMPIRE (both in the public
domain.) I did just have ocassion to repair a CCS 16K static board on
which a 2114 went bad after about 18 months of almost daily use. This
is the exception.
The best way to burn in the system is to use it in normal operation
intensively for a while. I find that the real life conditions will
show up any faults much more effectively than the so-called test
programs. If your machine runs WordStar for example, chances are that
there are no problems.
I will leave comments re disk drives and other components to others
who are more knowledgeable about them.

Really, the ideal would be:
The files are kept SQ'ed; there was a TYPESQ equiv.; MODEMxxx would
hexify on the fly if needed.  Result: everyone benefits!
If TYPESQ were difficult, then keep files UNSQ'ed and let MODEMxxx
SQ them on the fly (a bit much, but...).  I do think that MODEMxxx should
have the hexify option built-in for those of you that can't use 8-bit.
Well, enuf for dreaming.     Glenn

I'd sure like to know where these rumors about "graphics support"
under 3.0 are coming from!  In all of my discussions with persons
about 3.0, and in all of the literature I've seen on the subject, there
has been no mention of any kind of graphics.  I can't even see
how such a thing would be implemented... What KIND of graphics?  For
what kind of graphics devices?  Barring convincing evidence to the
contrary, I would brand these rumors as hogwash.

In fact, everything I've learned so far about 3.0 leads me to expect
it will be about as exciting as a new assembler for the IBM 360.
Digital Research seems to have no interest in supporting 3.0 for
other than large OEM's with turnkey-type systems.  The "advances"
of 3.0 all sound pretty dubious, and I understand that the documentation
isn't even up to D.R.'s usual low standards.  Given that D.R. plans
to continue to "support" 2.2, it appears that 3.0 is an attempt
to squeeze some bucks out of the "higher-end" Z80 machines currently
on the market.  I'm not against new software for 8080/Z80's, but
I view 3.0 with a considerable lack of interest.

I think I know what they are refering to.

Morrow uses his own terminal (an adm-20) with the
micro decision.  It tends to act like an adm31 with
the absolute cursor addressing reversed.

The adm-31 does an ESC = Y X to goto a position, while
morrows terminal does an ESC = X Y.

Morrow therefore has put a hack in the bios that checks for
ESC followed by '='.  It then intercepts the next two characters
and reverses them.

I suspect that this is the protential incompatibility
problem.  Worst case solution for the h19 is re-hacking
the BIOS supplied with the micro-decision.

The "graphics support" everyone seems to be taking for granted
consists of a couple of BIOS calls to do cursor addressing, clear
screen and the like, according to what I have been told. It would make
applications programming a little easier, but I strongly suspect that
most developers of CP/M software will elect to stay 2.2 compatible. I
see 3.0 as a hacker's joy and wonder if it will make much of a dent in
the 2.2 installed user base.
Running with bank switched memory and deblocking in the BDOS rather
than the BIOS, time stamping of files, and the like seem to be the
main attractions of 3.0. My understanding is that the current version
still has a couple of bugs. D.R. in their infinite(?) wisdom elected
not to make 3.0 available to individuals (probably because the doc is
up to usual standards of illegibility); I intend to get it as soon as
possible, but no way do I see throwing out 2.2.

Dear Rick:
	Thanks for the plug for SIG/M and ACG-NJ.  I wish to just
correct you on one thing.  One does not have to be a member of ACG-NJ
to order or copy SIG/M disks.  This service is offered to both members
and non-members at no extra charge.  Also, SIG/M has now released
85 volumes.  A copy of our printed catalog is $1 or $1.50 via mail.
It can be ordered from: SIG/M, Box 97, Iselin NJ 08830.

early on in the initialization code, this
is some osborne dependant code to swap in a set
of roms (from 000 to 1ff) and then procede to try
to write to them...if it fails, the sucker just
warm boots, and if it doesn't, then you're ok.
here's the patch so anyone can use it:

location 4436h is the starting location of the

Let me put some rumors to rest.

(* Disclaimer *)
I am a former DR employee, and possibly a future employee. I was a
summer-intern in the graphics group. My total time spent hacking CP/M
totals only about 3 months. For one of those, I was priviledged
enough to be a beta-test for CP/M 3.0. The following information
should not be taken as an ad for DR or as any statement of the
functions of future DR products.
(* End Disclaimer *)

1) Graphics:
The new graphics package that DR will come out with will (at last
report) be 2.2 compatible. I am not a liberty to discuss the details
of implementation, but I can say that there is more to it then Mr.
Weinstein suggests. 

The new graphics subroutine package will support some form of the new
GKS graphics standard, level 1B. Again, at last report, it will be
accessible from Pl/I, Fortran, and Pascal. CB-80 is also a
possibility.

I will divulge further info on this as soon as the product hits the
market.

2) CP/M 3.0:
Again, I was using an early beta test version, but I do think that
CP/M 3.0 is a significant upgrade over 2.2 FOR SOME SYSTEMS. In
particular, if you are privileged enough to have banked memory, or a
hard disk, you might be interested.

Via:  Brl-Bmd; 24 Nov 82 10:20-EST

I've recently been trying to configure WordStar for an IDS 480 printer.
As long as I only tell WordStar that it's a dumb tty-like printer,
things work pretty well.  But not satisfied with leaving well enough
alone, I've been trying to configure it so that it makes use of the
proportional spaceing features.  Here's where I get into trouble.

First of all, the escape sequences on the 480 are NOT binary.  For 
instance, the sequence to space over 15/120ths of an inch would be:
	<esc><U><,><1><5><,><$>
In other words, for each character you write on the paper, you end up
sending eight.  Not quite...  make that nine, because the printer has
already spaced past the character it just printed, so you have to send
a backspace, and then the foobar sequence above.  As you might expect,
WordStar driving the IDS in this mode ends up printing slower than a
teletype.

The second half of the problem is the prism's automatic proportional
spacing and justification mode.  In order for this to work, you send
the printer a stream of text without carriage returns, and the printer
decides how and where to split it into lines.  When you finally
send a carriage return, that ends the paragraph.  Try to tell WordStar
how to do that!

Does anyone have any bright ideas?  Another thought might be to redo
the internal printer firmware, so that it accepted the QUME or DIABLO
escape sequences.  Does anyone know what processor lies in the inards
of this beast?  Also what type of prom for the firmware, and also what
kind of prom/character generator for the fonts?  (Obviously I haven't
taken this one apart yet, since it isn't mine, and I'm not that 
desparate...  yet...)

Thanks in advance for any info.

This may be old stuff to some of you, but I thought I'd post it anyway
since it could save considerable time if you don't know about it.  Two
people here spent a lot of time trying to get the old N* single density
disk controller to work with the Polymorphic 8813 CPU with frustrating
results.  The problem is that the clock interrupt on the CPU card must
be disabled for the N* controller to work properly.

Do you know of any on-line depository of programs in MBASIC (or other
BASICs)?  Nobody seems to admit to using BASIC but I find it very
useful and, when compiled, fast.  I know that lots of good scientific
type BASIC programs exist but I would like to avoid typing the source.
For example: statistics, navigation, path profiles & propagation loss
etc. etc.  I don't see much interest in BASIC on the part of the
INFO-CPM correspondants.  Maybe you know of another host that has a
BASIC interest group??  There are lots of programs available for
Northstar BASIC thru the user groups but I have found that the
programs have bugs or limitations.  They are often the contributions
of gross amateurs who assume particular system configurations, like
POKEs to N* DOS (at an assumed location).

A network depository of BASIC programs is, I feel, likely to have
well written and reliable programs with continuous user refinement.

Know of any such network resource??  Al

I appreciate Tony's message about 3.0, but it leads me to suspect there
is still alot of confusion about 3.0 flowing around.  First of all,
the D.R. Graphics PACKAGE is, as far as I know, a completely separate
offering from CP/M itself, and in fact does conform to certain
graphics standards.  The rumors I was addressing were the ones
that said "... and CP/M 3.0 will support graphics".  This implies that
a graphics package is PART of 3.0, which I have no reason to believe
to be true.  In fact, Tony DID say that the graphics package was 2.2
compatible.  So I guess we've laid *that* rumor to rest.

Let's review what we know about CP/M 3.0 to date:

(I do not claim this to be an unbiased view, as will rapidly become
clear):

1) Provides more "menu-oriented" features/help command.  
   -- probably good for SOME OEM's but probably inadequate for most
      users, or at least unwanted by many.  Probably aimed at the
      turnkey business market.

2) Automatic searching of USER 0 if program not found on current
   user area.  
   -- what an advance!  ZCPR has provided this sort of functionality,
      and MUCH, MUCH more, for free, for a long time.

3) Disk blocking/deblocking moved to BDOS.
   -- this is a feature???  D.R. only claims "functional" compatibility
      between 2.2 and 3.0.  I suspect there are some assumptions about
      the sophistication of your programs -- I'd bet any reasonable
      amount that ALOT of heavily used programs will not work without
      modification under 3.0.  

4) Some sort of date/time stamping.
   -- reasonable I suppose.  Most other systems have provided such
   a feature all along.  Whether it is sophisticated enough for
   easy interfacing to different sorts of clocks, etc. is another
   matter.  See, I am TRYING to be fair!

5) Some sort of file I/O redirection.  Gee, just what Microshell
   does now!  Why do I get the feeling that there will be some
   sort of restrictions to redirection, like, maybe only BDOS
   output (not BIOS output) will work properly with redirection?
   (We had to do both for MARC and it was a PAIN.)

6) Memory Usage.  Now we get to the real nitty gritty.  Supposedly there
   will be two versions of CP/M 3.0.  One for people without bank-
   switched memory and one for people with additional memroy.  If you
   are running a simple 64K system, the *other* features of CP/M apparently
   take up at least another 4K from standard 2.2.  (We know that these
   features must be coming from somewhere, and obviously you can no
   longer overlay that portion of the BDOS which has the disk blocking/
   deblocking code unless you a running a very simple program.
   
   If you have more than 64K memory, and someone to figure out how
   to interface it with your new 3.0 bios (apparently D.R. has NO
   interest in helping other than large, turnkey-type OEM's with
   such support), you can let the system reside in a different
   bank of memory, and give yourself a larger TPA.  Also, apparently
   you use the additional memory in such a manner as to provide the
   same "sort" of functionality that FAST/SPEED have provided under
   1.4 and 2.2 to do reasonable disk buffering.  How well this works
   under the D.R. implementation, or how difficult it is to interface,
   remains to be same.  I'll bet that > 64K memory bioses are a real
   PAIN to get working right, and will be very highly system dependent.

   The idea of having a larger TPA sounds nice at first, unless you
   consider having any sort of compatibility with 2.2 to be
   important!  If you plan to write programs that will still run under
   2.2, you will still be restricted to the "standard" size TPA's,
   and there are one hell of alot of 2.2's out there!

I claim that the bottom line remains the same -- 3.0 has been oriented
almost totally toward the OEM who plans to run many "identical"
systems (or nearly so), and doesn't mind a very complex bios since
there is only one hardware configuration to worry about.  The fact
that D.R. has told non-OEM's to "go away" when it comes to 3.0 is
highly suspicious.  I won't even drag up the issue of documentation
quality again... we all know about that.  The issue of CP/M 2.2
compatibility is also less important to such OEM's since, often they
will just be running their own collection of programs on their hardware,
and won't even try to distribute their software more widely.

---

In answer to a number of questions I've received, I'm hoping to get
MARC out in some form quite early in '83, and I will take a look
at the issues of CP/M 3.0 compatiblity.  But, frankly, I don't
consider it to be a priority task.  In fact, I don't know if I really
want to take the time to get my complex hard disk/floppy bios running
under 3.0!  If I use the bank-switched version, I've got system
dependencies again, and if I use the the non-banked version, I lose
4K off the top!  Neither of these options is particularly appealing.
For now, MARC will be a 2.2 compatible product, period.

By the way, I've been "warned" that there will be some sort of review
of MARC in the December BYTE (apparently as a text "box" included in the
review of two other software products).  The person who wrote the
article is one of the beta test sites -- though he has not had the
most up-to-date version of the system or utilities by any means.
I think he wrote the article about eight months ago and it has 
taken until now to get into print!  Anyway, it might be amusing
reading.  I *hope* it's amusing...

For those interested and who don't subscribe, I just though I'd
mention that the December-82 issue of DR. DOBB'S JOURNAL has the
first half of a listing of Small-C V.2.  The second half will be
published in the January-83 issue.  (And hopefully someone will
upload it to MC:)

I haven't looked at the compiler in detail, however the article
states that it differs from V.1 in the following ways:

1. Code optimization has been added.  Programs are now typically
   15 to 30 percent smaller than before.

2. Data initialization is supported for global variables, arrays,
   and pointers.  Uninitialized objects default to binary zero.

3. Constant expressions are now evaluated at compile time.  They
   may also be used as array dimensions, data initializers, and in 
   "case" statements.

4. the #ifdef, #ifndef, #else, and #endif statements are supported 
   with nesting.

5. The "extern" storage class is supported for global variable,
   array pointer, and function declarations.  The effect is to
   declare them as external references to the assembler.

6. A mechanism for passing an argument count to called functions is
   provided.

7. The following new statements are now supported:
   a. for
   b. do/while
   c. switch/case/default
   d. goto
   
8. Lists of expressions are now permitted.

9. The assignment operators |=, ^=, &=, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=, >>=,
   and <<= are now supported.

10. The logical operators || and && are supported.  Testing proceeds
    left to right and ceases when the outcome is known.

11. The operators ~ and ! are now supported

12. Local variables are now local to the block rather than the
    whole function.

13. The back-slash escape sequences for character and string constants
    have been added (per DDJ #56).

There is more, but I think this gives you an idea what has been done.

This product, advertised in Byte, is excellent  -- at least based on a week's experience.
It is a thesarus which can be accessed directly 
or from inside Wordstar!  It's extremely fast (for a
floppy disc/z80).  Much faster in the look-up mode than The Word, for example.

It allows one to put the cursor on a word,
hit escape twice, and quickly see the thesarus entry
for that word. You can then select a word from the 
thesarus list,  it will move the selected word into
your text and drop the original word. It gets capitalization right most of the time.


Two problems. 
 Price  $150  which is reasonable.
 It uses about 200k of disk space.

If you write a lot in wordstar, it's a very handy
tool.

I too read about the RH Thesarus and was impressed by the description.
There are other useful programs such as spelling checkers that interface
to Wordstar in a similar way.

Let's suppose I prefer Mince over Wordstar and would like to interface
it to the Thesarus.  This is reasonable considering that I (like all
Amethyst users) have the C sources to the outer (command interpreter)
portion of Mince.  Is there a specification for how such external
packages get loaded (e.g. as overlays) and how they interact with the
text buffer and screen?  Is it useful enough to form a general purpose
standard for editors in the CP/M environment?

Actually, there are some good cases for a larger TPA.  Microsoft (and probably
others) seem not to have heard of a virtual memory loader.  The L80 program
requires that it be able to fit both the loader AND the program in memory
at the same time.  Couple that to the fact that the loader keeps growing with
each version, and that BLANK COMMON takes up room even during load.

What you have left is programs that you have to squeeze over and over to make
load, but which have lots of memory left free when they are executed.

Conclusion:  My system needs more memory (at present) than the person who  
runs a .COM file.

There is a bug in the routine that prints the day of the week in the
conditionally assembled routine for the Godbout System Support 1 real
time clock.  I don't know whether it has been reported before.  As the
code was distributed, it always prints 'Sunday' for the day of the week.
This is because the routine is reading a zero byte in the MSM5832 by
outputting CREAD+6 to the command port.  This should be CREAD+7 to 
return the 'days one' digit.

I have been trying to get BYE79 up and running on the RADIO SHACK Model
16 and have little information about the serial ports. I know that the
Status Port is F6H and the data port is F4H and have gotten the
MSTAT,MINPUT,MOUTPUT routines to work ok...my problem is in detecting
the carrier. I noticed that if you keep reading F6H....the status
lies...  there must be something else to do..

I am using a Hayes Smartmodem on the Model 16's Serial Port A.

Can someone provide me with the information on the serial ports or...

Does anyone have BYE up on the Model 16?

Any inputs would be appreciated!    Dennis

Two additional points:

	362 Fifth Avenue
	New York, N.Y. 10001

	Dictronics Customer Service 
		(505) 281-5444

I'm not sure that that number is correct for ordering.

(2) Two people asked me it this program RHT could
be run from inside Mince or other non-Wordstar Editors.
As far as I can tell, the answer is no.
The RHT has a standalone mode.  The computer will
look up words in the thesarus for you.  It's not nearly as convenient
as using the thesarus inside the word processor!
(But, it's faster than a paper, ink, fingers, mind thesarus processor).

The following is largely a repeat of a message I sent recently to INFO-CPM.
I've been getting a multitude of bizarre error messages back from various
network gateways, and I have no way to know if this message reached
the majority of intended recipients, thusly this rerun.

I will add a couple of comments here in reference to a message I got
from someone who *did* receive my message.  While I agree that having
a big TPA would be nice for development in some cases, my biggest
concern is that we will still see more and more programs that will
REQUIRE that sort of TPA for program *usage* later on, not just
for development.  I would suggest that this will lead to a
(potentially serious) fragmentation between those with "normal"
TPAs and those with "extended" TPAs via unique bank-switched memory
schemes.  The fact that some linkers, for example, don't efficiently
use the available memory is the fault of lazy software designers,
and not necessarily the sort of problem at which we should simply
"throw more memory" .  Enough on that, here's the original message.
My apologies to those of you who may have already seen it...

---

I appreciate Tony's message about 3.0, but it leads me to suspect there
is still alot of confusion about 3.0 flowing around.  First of all,
the D.R. Graphics PACKAGE is, as far as I know, a completely separate
offering from CP/M itself, and in fact does conform to certain
graphics standards.  The rumors I was addressing were the ones
that said "... and CP/M 3.0 will support graphics".  This implies that
a graphics package is PART of 3.0, which I have no reason to believe
to be true.  In fact, Tony DID say that the graphics package was 2.2
compatible.  So I guess we've laid *that* rumor to rest.

Let's review what we know about CP/M 3.0 to date:

(I do not claim this to be an unbiased view, as will rapidly become
clear):

1) Provides more "menu-oriented" features/help command.  
   -- probably good for SOME OEM's but probably inadequate for most
      users, or at least unwanted by many.  Probably aimed at the
      turnkey business market.

2) Automatic searching of USER 0 if program not found on current
   user area.  
   -- what an advance!  ZCPR has provided this sort of functionality,
      and MUCH, MUCH more, for free, for a long time.

3) Disk blocking/deblocking moved to BDOS.
   -- this is a feature???  D.R. only claims "functional" compatibility
      between 2.2 and 3.0.  I suspect there are some assumptions about
      the sophistication of your programs -- I'd bet any reasonable
      amount that ALOT of heavily used programs will not work without
      modification under 3.0.  

4) Some sort of date/time stamping.
   -- reasonable I suppose.  Most other systems have provided such
   a feature all along.  Whether it is sophisticated enough for
   easy interfacing to different sorts of clocks, etc. is another
   matter.  See, I am TRYING to be fair!

5) Some sort of file I/O redirection.  Gee, just what Microshell
   does now!  Why do I get the feeling that there will be some
   sort of restrictions to redirection, like, maybe only BDOS
   output (not BIOS output) will work properly with redirection?
   (We had to do both for MARC and it was a PAIN.)

6) Memory Usage.  Now we get to the real nitty gritty.  Supposedly there
   will be two versions of CP/M 3.0.  One for people without bank-
   switched memory and one for people with additional memroy.  If you
   are running a simple 64K system, the *other* features of CP/M apparently
   take up at least another 4K from standard 2.2.  (We know that these
   features must be coming from somewhere, and obviously you can no
   longer overlay that portion of the BDOS which has the disk blocking/
   deblocking code unless you a running a very simple program.
   
   If you have more than 64K memory, and someone to figure out how
   to interface it with your new 3.0 bios (apparently D.R. has NO
   interest in helping other than large, turnkey-type OEM's with
   such support), you can let the system reside in a different
   bank of memory, and give yourself a larger TPA.  Also, apparently
   you use the additional memory in such a manner as to provide the
   same "sort" of functionality that FAST/SPEED have provided under
   1.4 and 2.2 to do reasonable disk buffering.  How well this works
   under the D.R. implementation, or how difficult it is to interface,
   remains to be same.  I'll bet that > 64K memory bioses are a real
   PAIN to get working right, and will be very highly system dependent.

   The idea of having a larger TPA sounds nice at first, unless you
   consider having any sort of compatibility with 2.2 to be
   important!  If you plan to write programs that will still run under
   2.2, you will still be restricted to the "standard" size TPA's,
   and there are one hell of alot of 2.2's out there!

I claim that the bottom line remains the same -- 3.0 has been oriented
almost totally toward the OEM who plans to run many "identical"
systems (or nearly so), and doesn't mind a very complex bios since
there is only one hardware configuration to worry about.  The fact
that D.R. has told non-OEM's to "go away" when it comes to 3.0 is
highly suspicious.  I won't even drag up the issue of documentation
quality again... we all know about that.  The issue of CP/M 2.2
compatibility is also less important to such OEM's since, often they
will just be running their own collection of programs on their hardware,
and won't even try to distribute their software more widely.

---

In answer to a number of questions I've received, I'm hoping to get
MARC out in some form quite early in '83, and I will take a look
at the issues of CP/M 3.0 compatiblity.  But, frankly, I don't
consider it to be a priority task.  In fact, I don't know if I really
want to take the time to get my complex hard disk/floppy bios running
under 3.0!  If I use the bank-switched version, I've got system
dependencies again, and if I use the the non-banked version, I lose
4K off the top!  Neither of these options is particularly appealing.
For now, MARC will be a 2.2 compatible product, period.

By the way, I've been "warned" that there will be some sort of review
of MARC in the December BYTE (apparently as a text "box" included in the
review of two other software products).  The person who wrote the
article is one of the beta test sites -- though he has not had the
most up-to-date version of the system or utilities by any means.
I think he wrote the article about eight months ago and it has 
taken until now to get into print!  Anyway, it might be amusing
reading.  I *hope* it's amusing.. .

What's wrong with a bunch of people getting together (say, 25 or 30 -- a
club, perhaps), buying an OEM license, and then helping each other
configure similar copies of 3.0 with ZCPR and any other features they
want? Perhaps a bunch from the net can get together and un-hair most of
the interfacing code -- standardising the parts we use which are the
same.

I've always wondered what extra info an OEM got on CPM anyway, and as a
member of a corporation like this, I would be able to see. I wouldn't be
ablle to show other people, but that's about what it's like these days
with other software packages.

Offhand, I can see a few potential problems with your
proposed idea...

1) The way D.R. operates these days, I doubt if 20 or 25 people is
   what they're thinking of when they're talking about OEM's!  I suspect
   they are thinking much larger numbers.

2) I have reason to believe that the INFO-CPM readership probably
   represents about the MOST diverse collection of CP/M hardware to
   be found anywhere -- a real cross-section.  This means that it
   is unlikely that many of us will have identical hardware configurations,
   particularly in the area of disks, memory, I/O, and the other
   parameters that can make BIOSes a pain.  Anyone out there want
   to write a 3.0 BIOS for Persci floppies, a Morrow 10 Meg drive,
   and circa 1979 Microbyte memory boards?  Fat chance.

3) Given the additional memory apparently required for 3.0, and the
   presumed complexity of new BIOSes, it is not clear how many of
   us would WANT to go to 3.0 even if it were made easier.  Many of
   us have programs that would most likely need substantial modification
   to run under 3.0, and some people really don't have an urge to throw
   more money down the CP/M rathole this late in the game.

P.S.  I wouldn't stop using MARC in any case.  Every time I pop down
      to CP/M I feel like I've stepped back 10 years.

A few comments concerning Gumby's msg.  The idea of a club getting together
and purchasing an OEM agreement is probably quite reasonable.  The minimum
number of copies for a reasonable discount is usually 25, and the discount
is usually about 60% of list.  I see no reason for DR to not agree to this.

As for what extra info OEMers get; virtually nothing.  Just a little earlier
and a little more unreadable.  However, they are for certain on the list
for the mailout of fixes, which a good deal of them then do NOT pass on.
(Note: P&T is one of the few I know of who send out fixes, both from them-
selves and DR, as they come out.)

About ZCPR and 3.0.  The OEM agreement prevents the OEMer from modifying
the BDOS and CCP (or other included processors).  He can add additional
processors (FORMAT, MEMTEST, FOOBAR, that sort of thing), but he cannot
sell CP/M cum ZCPR as CP/M.  A legally fine point?  It might be permissable
to distribute the original CP/M 3.0, unmodified, and with a copy of ZCPR
and instructions (or an auto-install program).  That might meet the needs
of the ARPA community.

I recently downloaded SQ-16 and USQ-19 from the MC-CPM archives.  The
documentation seems to be the old version 15 documentation, and without
going through the source (I only downloaded the COMs), I can't seem
to get wildcards to work in the manner that I expect they should.
Could someone please help me out and tell me what I'm assuming 
incorrectly?  The command that I'm giving that's causing an error is:

	A>usq b: b:*.doc

Now I assume that will squeeze all the .DOC files on B:, placing the
resultant .DQC files on B:.  It finds the first file, goes through
the analysis, and says "S not found" or some such error.  I'm
assuming (hoping) from the comments in the front of SQ-16 and USQ-19
that they will properly handle wildcards, so I don't need FLS.

I have found an infintely wrong behavior in the TMODEM V 3.0
porgram (on MIT-OZ). It does not take the last ^Z encountered in
the stream as EOF, but rather the first ^Z. This means you can't send
a file with a control-Z in it. The right thing to do is to have it
keep each packet until it sees if the next character is EOT or SOH, and
if it is EOT, go back and remove the ^Zs at the end of the last packet.
Do I have to fix the problem, or can someone more proficient at C do
it?

Hay.  If you guys are serious, I've got OEM agreements with several companies
and, (if your serious enough to commit to buying CPM 3.0), would be more than
willing to get one with DR and pass on the goodies.

    The San Diego Computer Society is planning to
build a software exchange system based on the RCP/M
software packages.  We would appreciate the following
information.  
    1) Is there a central clearing house for the latest
'official' versions of the software?  (Non-Arpa)
    2) Are any of the packages proprietary, and if so, who
do we contact?
    3) Has anyone implemented a multi-user RCP/M?  We are
looking at a Discovery multi-processor unit configured 
for a minimum of four dial-in lines.
    4) We may have to run a 'Show-and-Tell' program on
a large monitor on public display.  Have you seen anything
that would be good for this?

I am going to help a friend load files on his Osborne.  Contrary to the
documentation at the beginning of the program, does this run on one without
modification with a dumb modem?

CP/M Plus (it has already had a name change! formerly CP/M 3.0) will
be officially announced at Comdex this week according to a friend of
mine at D.R. His comments have also led me to believe that they have had
second thoughts about supporting end-users; the manuals are readable!
(so he claims) and designed for the hacker to be able to bring the
system up without need for valium.

D.R. has also announced a CBBS for supporting their products. I have not
tried it myself yet, but my friend tells me you need a valis serial number
to log in! He also says that their Vax has lost a lot of the older serial
numbers, so don't be all that surprised if you have trouble accessing
the CBBS (I won't even try out my Imsai CP/M 1.3 serial number!)

I get the feeling (maybe its just hope) that D.R. is making a greater
effort to support the CP/M community. I hope so.

I have a friend with an IBM PC and the Microstuf, Inc. program
"Crosstalk" (which is a program for communicating with a serial line).
He uses it, of course, to connect to his modem.

Does anyone know what terminal this program emulates, if any?  Is
there a standard set of control character sequences for the PC?

Is there any ITS CRTSTY options set up that would make my friend's
life more wonderful?

Is there some other list I should send this message to?
What happened to Info-Micro?

Thanks,

I called the number (408-649-5186) and found out it works. The hardware they
are using is:   Altos 8000-10 microcomputer;
                 (running CP/M 2.2(4FO));
                 single 8" floppy drive;
                 single 8" Shugart 10 M-byte hard disk;
                 Racal-Vadic VA3450P external modem.
Its nice to know you don't have to call during normal working hours. Now I'm
able leave a message when I have a problem, not the next working day.

MARC looks very much like V6 UNIX to the user.  It runs on any micro
that runs cp/m, and comes up by absorbing the cp/m bios from the existing
system.  It is not a multitasking system, so you can't fork things off to run
in the background, or do anything that implies two things going on at once.
An exception is that pipes from the shell are implemented with intermediate
files.  MARC has a version of BDS C that is custom made for it, I think with
floating point.  It also has a version of MINCE (an editor similar to emacs) 
for it.  It has a CP/M emulator so that all but the very largest CP/M software
will run under it.  I think anything that fits in a 48K TPA will work. 

I have a many page question and answer type blurb on it along with a
sample terminal session that I can send to whoever asks.  The material I have is
half a year old, and half several years old (When I talked to him 2 or 3 years
ago he was surprised it was still around!).  I saw it working last July; it
really does work!  In fact, uucp site "vortex" is a z80 running MARC!

vortex!lauren (Lauren Weinstein) is in charge of getting MARC to market.

Is that a fair description Lauren?

About 6 months ago, I ran into a (rather nasty) MPM 2.0 bug. While discussing
DRI's software support with someone, this came up again. Somebody suggested
posting it here, both as a warning, and on the off chance that sombody
knows of a fix.

The problem is that MPM does NOT reinitialize page zero in a when a process
exits, unless page zero of the partition is also page zero for a bank.

This is a problem if you have a program that twists things in page zero. Any
of the `CCP replacements' (microshell, etc) or a menu-driven system that
uses program chainging (Magic Wand II) will trip over this. The sympton is
that, after running such a program, you get the thing back the very next time
something exits, IF you took a hard (^C or whatever) exit.

When I talked to DRI about it, they said `send us a disk with software that
displays the problem, and we may look at it.' Just one of the many reasons
that I hate DRI.

This is the table that wordstar uses to calculate the size of

Does anyone know the address within WS.COM that this exists?
