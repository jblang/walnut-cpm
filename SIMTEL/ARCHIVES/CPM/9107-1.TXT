Subject: cp/m screenplay formatter
Message-ID: <R3gB51w163w@dorsai.com>

I use a kaypro 1, double-sided, double-density disk drives with the
wordstar 4.0 version.  A friend showed me a program for screen-
writing for DOS that did everything, including repagination if you
change the merest paragraph.  These tasks take me a full work day
at least.  Not having the spare cash for even a cheap DOS machine,
I thought to ask here.  Dos anyone know of a screenplay formatter,
specifically one that repaginate, for cp/m?  I would also like to
know if there is an off-line reader for cp/m.  I'm new-ish to these
PCboard and Unix BBSs.  Do you really need a separate off-line 
reader for every BBS program?  Thanks to one and all.

I had a 806 up and running for a while (until the HD gave up of old age).
The idea is that the machine boots either from floppy or from
harddisk. Of course the 806 (a server for up to 6 diskless z80 systems) was
supposed to boot from harddisk all the time. The trick was to simply press
the re-boot button immediately, and then it would try the other device.
I suppose it stored an indication of what was tried last time somewhere
in memory.

So, if you have a reset button on it, try using that.

The 80x series are sufficiently prehistoric _not_ to know something as
auto-configuration. You could try to find the boot ROM's, disassemble
them, find the right spot for correcting the boot device, and make new
EPROM's. ;-)

Greetings, Bert

I certainly can.  I -WROTE- one!  See, the Applied Engineering
Z80 Plus card for the II Plus, //e, IIGS and compatibles are
completely compatible with Microsoft's board.  One board will run
the other's CP/M (CP/AM).  In fact, I have a Microsoft SoftCard
(as in the original, not the SoftCard //e) and I tested the patch
under Applied Engineering's CP/AM 5.1 and it works well.  But you
MUST be using a Super Serial card or something like it, i.e. one
that runs a 6551 at memory locations 0E0x8 through 0E0xB where
x=8H + slot.

ankh@diku..dk (Klaus Ambrass) answered a request for the source code for 
a program to generate ?Y? (LZH) compressed files was in C. Roger Warren 
in San Diego coded CRLZH12.LBR in assembler, which will both compress and

did not feel he was done with his work (or so he stated to me).

I believe Roger is soon to release an update, possibly by the end of the 
summer. Am hopeful he will release the source code at that time.

Meanwhile, since it is not in a high level language, you could 
disassemble. On the other hand, I would suspect not many would understand

BASPLOT.LBR     Regression and Spline functions plot in BASIC

Given a set of experimental points the program will plot the points on either
graphics screen or graphics plotter or will write all command lines into a
data file.  If required, the program will calculate regression coefficients
(8 models) or spline functions coefficients (their first and second derivati-
ves) and will plot these functions.  Source code files (Microsoft BASCOM Com-
piler v.5.3) can be easily modified to suit.  Literature references are given
where appropriate.

pd2:<cpm.asmutl>
ASMLIB.LBR      Library of .ASM routines and utilities

This is a collection of .asm routines which are compatible with Digital
Research macro assembler, linker and librarian (RMAC, LINK, and LIB).  The
routines include miscelaneous functions (read and write clock, RAM tests,
monitor, read analogue to digital channel, etc.), screen functions, character
string functions, conversions, simple maths and numeric printing.  Utilities
for manipulation of binary files, reading and writing EPROMs (27.. series),
and terminal setup utility.

Have a person with an H89 and a Magnolia disc controller.  As far as he knows
he has only used hard sectored disks.  No manuals to be found, etc, etc, etc.

It seems like I remember, back in the days when I had my 89 running, that the
Magnolia would support soft sectored disks.

Can anyone tell me if it is possible to pull a jumper or flip a dip switch
and get the Magnolia to use soft sectored disks?  It would be nice to see the

I have something you might call a manual, but it was for the TRS-80/TRS-DOS
version of small-c (waaaay back). There's not much manual you need I think.
Small-c is just a stripped down C; no floats/doubles, strict old style K&R.
Sorry, but I haven't got more recent info.

This is the famous & fabulous Macro-80 Macro Assembler Last time I tried to
get info about it (few years back) the importer for Microsoft in the Netherlands
didn't now what it was. I'ld allmost publicly advise you to get a copy, but
who knows how Microsoft would react... ;-)

>3. How to use small-c with LASM and MLOAD instead (or any other combination

The only important thing is compatibility. Small-c produces M80 assembly.
The library (did you get it in source?) is probably an L80 ".REL" file.

Just an editor.

UZI was written for a fairly complete compiler. I forgot, sorry. Maybe
somebody else knows more (the author of UZI? ;-)).

This is not so much of a problem. What is a problem (and see the next article
in this group) is hardware/software prerequisites, what cpm support is needed,
how to install it, what constitutes, in short, a fully-configured environment
in which the thing has to run.

For example, while smc211 outputs l80/m80 code, an earlier version (203)
makes LASM/MLOAD code. However, it writes the assembler output on stdout
and as far as I can tell there is no I/O redirection in CPM. And no way to
specify an output file name for the compiler!

This sort of hijinks by software makes life very difficult...

The library source is there, but given the difficulties mentioned above
I can't quite see what to do with it yet. Also, one would presumably need a 
library manager along the lines of Borland TLIB to make alternate libraries.

See last point. How are relocateable libraries made under CPM? For different

OK, so if anyone knows a better way to go, speak up! I am trying to do this
with all PD/shareware software since one _cannot_ buy cpm software in this 
country any more (as far as I know), and in any case, it seems silly to 
actually spend _real money_ on this stuff!

I've had a look at the ASMUTL stuff at wuarchive, does anyone know if any
of these assembler/linker packages will replace L80/M80? 

And so on...I must be mad!

Well, here is my standard UZI plug, from about a year ago.  It mentions
the compiler I used.  Note that I am very close to releasing UZI-280,
which is ten times cooler than UZI, assuming you have a Z280 computer.

UZI is presumably still on SIMTEL20, and probably other places as well.





		UZI: UNIX Z-80 IMPLEMENTATION

		  Written by Douglas Braun


Introduction:

UZI is an implementation of the Unix kernel written for a Z-80 based
computer.  It implementts almost all of the functionality of the
7th Edition Unix kernel.  UZI was written to run on one specific
collection of custom-built hardware, but since it can easily have device
drivers added to it, and it does not use any memory management hardware,
it should be possible to port it to numerous computers that current use
the CP/M operating system.  The source code is written mostly in C,
and was compiled with The Code Works' Q/C compiler.  UZI's code was
written from scratch, and contains no AT&T code, so it is not subject
to any of AT&T's copyright or licensing restrictions.  Numerous 7th
Edition programs have been ported to UZI with little or no difficulty,
including the complete Bourne shell, ed, sed, dc, cpp, etc.


How it works:

Since there is no standard memory management hardware on 8080-family
computers, UZI uses "total swapping" to achieve multiprocessing.
This has two implications:  First, UZI requires a reasonably fast
hard disk.  Second, there is no point in running a different process
while a process is waiting for disk I/O.  This simplifies the design
of the block device drivers, since they do not have to be interrupt-based.

UZI itself occupies the upper 32K of memory, and the currently running
process occupies the lower 32K.   Since UZI currently barely fits in 32K,
a full 64K of RAM is necessary.

UZI does need some additional hardware support.  First, there must be
some sort of clock or timer that can provide a periodic interrupt.
Also, the current implementation uses an additional real-time clock
to get the time for file timestamps, etc.  The current TTY driver assumes
an interrupt-driven keyboard, which should exist on most systems.
The distribution contains code for hard and floppy disk drivers, but
since these were written for custom hardware, they are provided only
as templates to write new ones.


How UZI is different than real Unix:

UZI implements almost all of the 7th Edition functionality.
All file I/O, directories, mountable file systems, user and group IDs,
pipes, and applicable device I/O are supported.  Process control
(fork(), execve(), signal(), kill(), pause(), alarm(), and wait()) are fully
supported.  The number of processes is limited only by the swap space
available.  As mentioned above,  UZI implements Unix well enough to
run the Bourne shell in its full functionality.  The only changes made
to the shell's source code were to satisfy the limitations of the C compiler.

Here is a (possibly incomplete) list of missing features and limitations:

    The debugger- and profiler-related system calls do not exist.

    The old 6th edition seek() was implemented, instead of lseek().

    The supplied TTY driver is bare-bones.  It supports only one port,
    and most IOCTLs are not supported.

    Inode numbers are only 16-bit, so filesystems are 32 Meg or less.

    File dates are not in the standard format.  Instead they look like
    those used by MS-DOS.

    The 4.2BSD execve() was implemented.  Additional flavors of exec()
    are supported by the library.

    The format of the device driver switch table is unlike that of
    the 7th Edition.

    The necessary semaphores and locking mechanisms to implement 
    reentrant disk I/O are not there.  This would make it harder to
    implement interrupt-driven disk I/O without busy-waiting.


A Description of this Release:

Here is a list of the files supplied, and a brief description of each:


intro:		What you are reading

config.h:	Setup parameters, such as table sizes, and the device
		driver switch table.

unix.h:		All strcuture declarations, typedefs and defines.
		(Includes things like errno.h).

extern.h:	Declarations of all global variables and tables.

data.c:		Dummy to source extern.h and devine globals.

dispatch.c:	System call dispatch table.

scall1.c:	System calls, mostly file-related.

scall2.c:	Rest of system calls.

filesys.c:	Routines for managing file system.

process.c:	Routines for process management and context switching.
		Somewhat machine-dependent.

devio.c:	Generic I/O routines, including queue routines.

devtty.c:	Simple TTY driver, slightly-machine dependent.

devwd.c:	Hard disk driver.  Very machine-dependent.

devflop.c:	Floppy disk driver.  Very machine-dependent.

devmisc.c:	Simple device drivers, such as /dev/mem.

machdep.c:	Machine-dependent code, especially real-time-clock and
		interrupt handling code.

extras.c:	Procedures missing from the Q/C compiler's library.

filler.mac:	Dummy to make linker load UZI at correct address.

makeunix.sub:	CP/M SUBMIT file to compile everything.

loadunix.sub:	CP/M SUBMIT file to load everything.


Miscellaneous Notes:

UZI was compiled with the Code Works Q/C C compiler and the Microsoft
M80 assembler under the CP/M operating system, on the same hardware
it runs on.  Also used was a version of cpp ported to CP/M, since
the Q/C compiler does not handle macros with arguments.  However, there
are only a couple of these in the code, and they could easily be removed.

Because UZI occupies the upper 32K of memory, the standard L80 linker
could not be used to link it.  Instead, a homebrew L80 replacement linker
was used.  This generated a 64K-byte CP/M .COM file, which has the lower 
32K pruned by the CP/M PIP utility.  This is the reason for appearance
of the string "MOMBASSA" in filler.mac and loadunix.sub.

To boot UZI, a short CP/M program was run that reads in the UZI image,
copies it to the upper 32K of memory, and jumps to its start address.
Other CP/M programs were written to build, inspect, and check UZI filesystems
under CP/M.  These made it possible to have a root file system made before
starting up UZI.  If the demand exists, these programs can be included
in another release.


Running programs under UZI:

A number of 7th Edition, System V, and 4.2BSD programs were ported to
UZI.  Most notably, the Bourne shell and ed run fine under UZI.
In addition the 4.2BSD stdio library was also ported.  This, along
with the Code Works Q/C library and miscellaneous System V library 
functions, was used when porting programs.

Due to obvious legal reasons, the source or executables for most of these
programs cannot be released.  However, some kernel-dependent programs
such as ps and fsck were written from scratch and can be included in future
releases.  Also, a package was created that can be linked to CP/M .COM
files that will allow them to run under UZI.  This was used to get
the M80 assembler and L80 linker to run under UZI.  Cpp was also
ported to UZI.  However, it was not possible to fit the Q/C compiler
into 32K, so all programs (and UZI itself) were cross-compiled under CP/M.

The Minix operating system, written for PCs by Andrew Tanenbaum et al,
contains many programs that should compile and run under UZI.  Since
Minix is much less encumbered by licensing provisions than real Unix,
it would make sense to port Minix programs to UZI.  In fact, UZI itself
could be ported to the PC, and used as a replacement for the Minix kernel.

Can anyone recommend a small but useful editor ? 
I've been using Turbo Pascal as an editor, but I feel it's overkill
for short programs/files (note: I don't want line editors, eg ED,
just screen editors. Multiple files would be a bonus :)

I've seen UZI mentioned a lot in this group, but I've never
seen anything that really indicates what it is.
So, what is it ? 
What sort of CP/M machine does it require ? Hard disk, 1 or 2 floppies ?
56/128 k RAM ?

Also, can anyone answer the same questions for ZCPR3.3 ...I know
it's a replacement for the CCP, but I looked in the
ZCPR3.3 directory on wuarchivel.wustl.edu - there are a _lot_
of files there ... what are they all ? are they all needed ?
Will they run on any CP/M machine, do they depend
on being patched for each particular machine ??

<whew> Well, that's all (for now)
It might be best to e-mail replies to dcook@spam.adelaide.edu.au,
and if anyone else is as ignorant about CP/M as me ( :-), I'll summarize.

(the amazing thing is, I've been in an information vacuum w.r.t. CP/M
for 6 years now ! Especially in hearing about latest developments)

Well, the one I know of is called CRR0110.ZIP.  I can .uue it to you 
if you can undo that.  It allows you to use XRS mailers a.k.a. a few
other names as well.  A fellow in the UK has written it; actually, IS
writing it.  has gone thru 3 revs from CRR0030 since last October...

Let us know if you want it.   I post this so others can see if they want to
try it too...

BTW it is a memory hog.  I have to strip out my HD RSX so it can run.


See ya...

Well, I uploaded Portable WordStar to my DECmate II and hacked it over to run
there. It's a reasonabl WordStar implementation in 32K.

Subject: CPM compiler survey, please read & reply
Message-ID: <1991Jul12.081014.25381@cs.rug.nl>

Dear all,
  Now and again the question of available CP/M compilers pops up.
Lately this keeps centering around C compilers and Macro assemblers,
but I think it would be nice to get a more general overview.

  Now I'm strictly CP/M-80 (2.2/3) myself, but I suppose we've got an
audience with also CP/M-68k and CP/M-86 users. Undoubtebly the latter
versions have more coplete implementations, but let's see anyway.

Some compilers I can drag from memory:
  C: Small-c, BDS-C
  Pascal: Turbo-Pascal v3, Pascal/MT+
  BASIC: MBASIC (interpreter), CBASIC
  Assembly: M80, ASM (CP/M 1/2 standard), MAC/RMAC (CP/M 3 standard)
  Modula-2 (by rumor)
  Ada (sounds like a nightmare, but anyway)
  PL/M (never seen one, but the BDOS interface (parameters in BC/DE) is
    based on a PL/M convention)

  I would like to collect information about any compiler you can think of
that runs on CP/M machines, and I'll summarize the results. Preferably
I'ld like to get entries as this one:

  Language: C
  Compiler name: BDS-C version ??, Copyright holder: BD Software
  Status: sold???, last checked: 198?, where: computer shop
  Remarks: No floating point, K&R
  Minimal system: CP/M-80, 48k, floppy.

Especially the status of a package will be interesting. I doubt if many
shops still sell CP/M software, and the big question is: `how far can we
go?'

  Please mail your answers to me (laverman@cs.rug.nl). I'll let it
collect for maybe two weeks, and then compile a list.

Greetings, Bert

Thanks to Michael (mds@iddth2.id.dk) for pointing me to ARCSRC.TAR-Z
under PD2:<UNIX-C.ARC-PROGS> at SIMTEL20.  That did the trick.

Thanks to all the others, too, who offered help via e-mail.

I have been using version 2.03 of Small C from Simtel20 for some
time now with no difficulties.  Contrary to the above extract,
the compiler does support I/O redirection, in compiling and when
running programs generated by the compiler.  I use the LASM
version of the compiler. Using the link directive, the need to
copy the iolib.asm and call.asm files to the end of the compiler
output is unnecessary.  I also have a doc file for the compiler
that is not part of smc203.ark.
 
Redirection of i/o in Small C works as shown in the K+R book:
 
A>cc80a program.c >program.asm
 
would compile program.c to program.asm.
 
A>program <input.txt >output.txt
 
would run program.com created by Small C and LASM, with input
taken from file input.txt and output sent to file output.txt.
 
If you are interested in discussing Small C, please let me know.

Message-ID: <1991Jul10.144417.2625@convex.com>

I have an IMS (Industrial Micro Systems) Series 5000 CPM system, which 
has a model A820 winchester disk controller and Seagate 10Mbyte 
5 1/4" drives.  Unfortunately, the EPROM on the disk controller appears to
have gone bad (the EPROM is what configures the board as either an 8"
or 5 1/4" controller).  I would like to find someone out there who can
get me a copy of the EPROM, a hex dump of it, or at least some information
on how to generate a new one.  Any information at all would be greatly
appreciated (including if IMS is still in business, and if so where at).

In addition, my only copy of PLINK-II from Phoenix Software Associates 
for this same beast has gotten corrupted, and I would really like to
replace it if possible.  Anyone have any information on this company, or
where I might obtain a copy?

I wasn't aware that there existed any LZH-cruncher in CP/M (now I am).
And where please can I get a copy of CRLZH12.LBR? Site addr, mail addr,

You can say that again. I've been looking into it a bit and found a lot of
incomprehensible (sp?) stuff. Mind you, that the process of compacting data
was explained to me twice and it sounded sooooo easy, but that, when faced
with the actual code, I'd have to give up. I simply couldn't remember a
thing, and so far I haven't had any luck in finding any literature on it

Message-ID: <9318176@ub.cc.umich.edu>

In answer to a question from someone looking for a small handy editor, I use
something called VDE which takes up 10k of disk space (very nice) and has
WS-like commands, but produces regular ascii files, with cr's if you set a
right margin for auto-wrap.  It's not perfect, but it's very nice especially
for editing small command files and the like.
 
By the way, if any of you know where docs are, let me know.  There are a few
things I haven't been able to figure out, such as what the printing options
are, and how to use the split window function.

Message-ID: <1991Jul15.190307.17707@unx.sas.com>

I have an .LBR file of a PD FORTH (F83), that I would need to read, but I
do not have an .LBR file reader. I am not normally a CPM'er, but I do have
access to several Z80 systems I would like to put the FORTH on (there is
some source in the file I am told).

The problem is that I do not know how to read the file.... Any documentation
on the file format, or perhaps a reader (written in C, Pascal, Fortran, or
someother high level language available on my Unix workstation) is available.

Please help, since I need the FORTH source for a project that is already 
over-due (local area robotics contest).

BTW: If anyone has source to a PD Z80 FORTH system that they could email me,
     please let me know....

CRR works with XRS-Door (was RAX/QMX/etc.).

CRR is on SIMTEL if anyone is interested <CPM.BBS>.

Yes, CRR is still being developed. It was started in Easter 1990, 
and there's a group of CPM users on the local bulletin board who 
won't let me stop tweaking it.

> BTW it is a memory hog.  I have to strip out my HD RSX so it can run.

Yes, it needs 42K. I've tried as hard as I can to keep the 
requirements down (overlays), and the distribution versions have 
only 4K of space for the Turbo Pascal heap...

It's shareware. (Only 7 registrations in the whole year it's been 
released 8-( ).

Bug reports, suggestions, (dare I say it) registrations welcomed.

I have the full LBR for VDE version 2.66 on my Z-Node in central New 
Jersey. You can connect at (908) 754-9067 or through PCP (NJNBR) or 
Starlink (3319) at up to 2400 bps. Also have ZDE, which is VDE updated

You'd be better off using ZDE which is more up-to-date than VDE
(the author of VDE doesn't support CP/M anymore) and is ZCPR3
compatible.

I have received many inquiries about why SIMTEL20 does not publish
instructions for uploading files for those who wish to submit their
programs.  The reason is that we prefer to coordinate uploads by
having contributors contact us first so we can check to make sure the
program is not already in the repository.

File uploads are accepted via FTP using a special uploading account,
or via e-mail using a special mailbox which does not interfere with
regular correspondence.

If you have a program to upload please send e-mail to me with a short
description of the files you wish to submit.  Please do *not* send
files to my mailbox.  Because of local management policy, SIMTEL20
does not accept games for submission to the archives unless they are
strictly educational.

Thanks to all those who are actively supporting the respository by
helping us keep up to date with the latest programs.

Hello,

  I own an old Kaypro 4, still running CP/M 2.2, and am looking to find
two things: One: a ZModem up/download program and an uncompresser for

won't let me in.

Also, does anyone still sell the graphics chips for the old (pre-'84)
Kaypro IIs and 4s, I'd kind of like to be able to do VT-100 codes with
my Kaypro, so that I don't have to scrounge for adm3a or vt52 codes for

          assist in writing programs in 8080 and TDL version  Z80 
          assembler.  Assemble  with RMAC or uss the  source  for 
          your own reasons.
          The  main reason (for me) for writing this library  was 
          to  provide a configurable set of screen  driver  codes 
          (ie  cursor address, half intensity etc etc). This  was 
          done by putting a key-code at the start of the table of 
          attribute codes which another program searches for  and 
          patches  directly. So, you can patch  programs  written 
          with ASMLIB to suit most terminals.
          Other  functions in the library such as a  simple  time 
          delay,  CRC  generator, cursor addressing  and  message 
          printing make ASMLIB cute and simple to use.

FP        A  screen  oriented file patcher. Does a  neat  job  of 
          patching in ascii or hex and has a host of options etc. 

PROM150   A premium program for programming EPROMS on SME Systems 
          (bet  you never heard of us!) or S.D.  Systems  Prom100 
          cards. If you are this far into eprom programming  then 
          you should be able to figure out that for the 2764  and 
          bigger  eproms  you need an adaptor. Contact me  for  a 
          circuit diagram etc.

SETUP     A  program  that  directly patches  (wow!)  the  screen 
          driver codes in .COM files that use the ASMLIB program. 
          This  program should be accompanied by a (small?)  data 
          base  of  available  screen setup codes  which  can  be 
          edited and added to etc.

TATT      A program to TEST setup and ASMLIB screen drivers.

PS. If  anyone  out  there is doing development work  on  a  CP/M 
    system  for the '64180 chip and uses RMAC then I have my  own 
    source  for another library of functions including  interrupt 
    redirection etc. This is intended for embedded systems only.

How about posting it to SIMTEL20 (if that'd be OK with the author) so we can
all check it out/enjoy it/use it?  Keith Peterson is still the moderator,
and he still follows this group.  You can also find instructions on how
to post to SIMTEL20 in the (ack) comp.binaries.ibm.pc.archives group.

I believe so.  I wrote it...  I'll post it for those who are
interested, but I can't right now because the PC I'm using, which
I'm borrowing from a friend, is running hard drives only.  I'll

Rembrandt is still available from Central Computer Products for the
your Kaypro. The graphics program with a new ROM chip is $49. Rembrandt
is a graphics presentation software package. It includes on screen
drafting, both free hand and data graphing, as well as fancy printer
drivers to make hard copy presentations. Central Computer Products can
be contacted:

	330 Central Avenue
	Fillmore California 93015

David, you want ZMP15 for Zmodem. Don't be fooled by the 'Z' in the name. 
That refers to 'Zmodem' and not 'ZCPR' or 'Z-System'. It is a CP/M 
implementation of Zmodem in C, written by Ron Murray in Australia.

The 'uncompressor' you want is in either CRUNCH28.LBR or CRLZHnn.LBR 
(last CRLZH I have is version 1.1 but I think 1.2 is out). Either or both 
are readily available on Z-Nodes around the country. You can find them on 
my CRUNCH: directory on Z-Node 32 at (908) 754-9067. Use the NJNBR (for 
PC Pursuit) or 3319 (for StarLink) outdials if you have either service.
I have ZMP15.LBR on the MODEM: directory, if memory serves me right.

Which country ? Please remember that this is an *international*
network ... I don't know what exactly a Z-node is,
and I sure *don't* want to pay the phone bill
for calling one from Australia :-)

Besides, I got CRLZH from wuarchive.wustl.edu, (which mirrors
the wsmr-simtel20.army.mil archives of CP/M, MS-DOS, and
other software), via anonymous ftp, from the directory
mirrors/cpm/squsq, file crlzh11.lbr.

1. I just got a Kaypro 4, it has a Kaypro 4 case, and a 'non-glare' screen over the monitor...  it also has a Turbo modification... BUT it appears to be a kaypro ][! when it boots it says 'Kaypro II' and some Kaypro 4 programs don't seem to work on it... 

  What is the difference on the motherboard between a Kaypro 2 and 4?
  Also, could someone post a uuencoded ROM 'image' (ie bin file, or HEX...or asm that I can assemble...but I PREFER one already assembled, linked, and split into seperate image files)

Hi, everyone! 

I am looking for a hard drive that was made specifically for the Actrix, or
Access Matrix CP/M computer.  I know that this was a 10 meg hard drive with
Xebec HPIB controller in it.  Unfortunately, I do not know the model number
of the controller.  Anyhow, if anybody got that drive and is willing to sell
it, please let me know.  I would settle for a box with working controller
and bad drive.

If it's what I THINK it is, it is not a Kapyro specific program, but an ASCII
based instrument flight simulator.  It's called Instrument Flight if I remember
right.  I have it (on a Xerox 820-II), and it's not bad at all.

Last I knew, you could get it from Central Computer Products for around $30.
Elliam Associates might also have it.  In any case, they are both sources where
you can still get CP/M software.

CRUNCH28 will certainly do it for him, Chris, but I think that EXL (which I
sent him in uue form) is a better choice since it handles libraries as well.

Where can one get ZDE?  I had been using VDE, and like it moderately 
so.  Is ZDE ZCPR 3.0 capable?  (rather than 3.4 or 4.0 or whatever...)

As long as I'm wandering about in the quicksand of editors... is there 
a vi-clone for CP/M?

Well, that list is bogus.  Z-node #50 has not been in existance for at least
two years. . .   

I remember calling it in late '89 only to find it disconnected.

The good news is that:  Z-node 62, run by Lindsay Allen & Ron Murray
is going quite nicely.  They are even on Fido-net.  If anyone wants the
ZN62 Fido-net node number, I'll get it for them!

Mr. McEwen seems to have forgotten that there are sites called
"RCP/Ms".  Not everyone who runs a CP/M BBS necessarily runs a
Z-Node, Chris.  In fact, the RCP/M is the direct ancestor to the
Z-Nodes.  Don't also forget that Z-Nodes are, by their very
nature, RCP/Ms.

I have the full LBR for VDE version 2.66 on my Z-Node in central New 
Jersey. You can connect at (908) 754-9067 or through PCP (NJNBR) or

It is probably either an 802H or 803H.  Perhaps Ed Grey, who frequents these
parts, can shed some further light on it.  He is much more conversant with
TeleVideo things than I.

Is there anything that might tell the model? I know the 806 prints dots
while it is waiting for the harddisk to come up. Does it have a reset
button? try pressing it, maybe it'll switch over to the floppy drive.
(the 806 does this)

Sounds to me like your machine is configured to a satellite machine on a
Mmmost network. It's looking to boot from the network server rather than from
a local disk. There's a dipswitch that controls whether or not it does that,
but I haven't the foggiest which.

Assuming it's an 802 or 803, that is...

Message-ID: <9107220910.AA07810@nextasy2.eecs.wsu.edu>

i have to get rid of the following two systems, as soon as possible.  i am
not looking to get rich, merely to cover some of my initial investment
(i only have about $250 invested total) 
and give these systems a good home.  otherwise they get junked.

system #1:  a tei 18-slot motherboard, case, powersupply.  several boards,
including z80 cpu, probably 32-48k ram, (on multiple 8k boards, blech),
a custom disk controller (no drives though), and a 2sio/2pio board.  this
has been tested briefly, just to verify that it powers up and run zapple
properly.

system #2:  a running ccs system.  humongous power supply and case, 18-20
slot motherboard.  disk controller, two 8" drives.  5 serial ports.  64k
ram.  all cards are ccs boards.  most of the documentation on most of the
cards.  bios source, (etc) but i can't currently generate a new system (just
copy bootable disks and modify disk sectors manually to change the bios).
the disk drives are dsdd (1.2 megs).  10-15 1.2 meg disks filled with stuff;
another 30 or so low density (256k) disks.  disk case.

i am in a hurry right now, so i won't go into detail.  send me email and i can
give a complete summary of parts, with factory part numbers.  system #2 has
worked very well for me over the past few years, but i have reached a point
where i can no longer fit everything i own into my  pickup truck so i have
to ditch some of it.  make me an offer and its yours.  you will have to worry
about shipping charges; these suckers weight a ton.  hell, make me a semi
decent offer on system #2 and you can have #1 for a song.  you will probably
have to pay more for postage or shipping than anything else... unless you
are anywhere near pullman, washington (oh, yeah, right!)

please don't make me junk these...  both motherboards are excellent for
prototyping, but who has time for that kind of stuff???

anyway, contact me by email:

Hi all,

  My compiler survey did get some results, but I would like to
extend the list a little before posting it. particularly, there are
several compilers/packages mentioned by name only.

  Can anyone give me info on:

	FTL Modula-2 (also mentioned as Hisoft FTL Modula-2)
	Turbo Modula-2 (heard about it in comp.lang.modula2)
	Pro Pascal
	Janus/Ada C-Pack (Is that Ada, or just the manufacturers' name??)
	JRT Pascal

  Several remarks were made about Microsoft not caring anymore about
their products. Anyone from Microsoft on the list?

  RS (I suppose that is Radio Shack aka Tandy) in Australia seems to sell
quite some stuff for 3-figure amounts (Australian $). Anyone from Tandy in
the US on-line?

I believe I just said that.  I've been using ZCPR33 for a long
time (about a year and a half) and have had no problems with ZDE.
BTW, are you running ZCPR 3.0?  If so, you'd be better off
running ZCPR 3.3.  It's MUCH better than 3.0.  You don't have to
change your Z3BASE.LIB file.

I am pretty sure you have snagged one of the "network" stations from an
old TeleVideo system.  The dots you see are the machine waiting for the
network to respond via the RS422 port.  Someplace inside the machine is
a switch you can throw to defeat this portion of the BIOS, and force the
machine to run standalone.  I used a system like this about 10 years ago,
right before IBM announced the PC.  I don't have any of the docs, so I 
can't even begin to suggest which switch to play with.  I think I DO have
some of the original 5.25 disks around here someplace.  I'll see if there's
any documentation on them.  I think the OS was called MMMOST, or something
like that.  It was basically CP/M, made "easy" for idiots.

From the rear connection description, it sounds more like the server without
the hard drive.  Earl, is there open space for a hard drive or is it covered
with a blank panel?  Are the two ribbon cables and edge connectors for a hard
disk installed?  Do they connect to *anything* if so? 

No, don't characterize it as junk - at least not yet!

You might ask for more information at the Dino(saur) SIG of the San Diego 
Computer Society for help - lots of old-time CP/M Hackers that should 
collectively be able to come up with a solution for you.
 Also, Jade has a San Diego store, they MIGHT be able to come up with some 
information for you - but I wouldn't bet on it, as they completely 
discontinued their once-extensive CP/M support almost 10 years ago....

I recently acquired a Microsoft Softcard for an Apple ][+ that sits over

Is there some way to pass Z80 instructions to it on the bus (possible multi-processing)
is there any way I can program this card to do Z80 things without the
CP/M disks to run it?

and if not, does anyone have disks/manuals or copies thereof that they could

  Sure.  Just add the /O switch when you call BASCOM.  
  eg.  bascom=ziffle /o

Hey, this is amazing!! The 800 really IS a diskless mmmost client! At
least, I haven't seen any with another way of running. It wants the
server to send over the CP/M image.
  However, I'm starting to get confused about your description. Not
the 800, but the 806 SERVER has 6 connections on its back!, and didn't
you mention an empty spot where a harddisk could have been. Could it
be you have BOTH an 806 AND an 800, and didn't know BOTH have a Z80?
The 800 looks remarkably like a Tvi-950 terminal, and it is VERY easy
to mistake it for a dumb terminal!

P.S. if this is the case, you'ld better find an 806 WITH a harddisk
before you can do something with it. Earlyer version had a a small
HD (10 MB unformatted, about 7.5MB usable space), later versions
sported a slim-line TEAC floppy drive, and still later versions
had a 20MB HD.

Message-ID: <1991Jul24.152521@IASTATE.EDU>

 
    I am planning on making some modifications to my Osborne Executive.
    What I plan is to do the following:

       1.  Build a replacement memory board to add memory banks 2-6
       2.  Replace my 5 1/4" (180K) floppies with 3 1/2" (720K) floppies
       3.  Replace the Monitor EPROM (a 2764 with a 27128) and put in
              some addition built in functions.

    I have schematics and just about have the artwork for the memory
    board done.  However to get 2 and 3 above accomplished, I need the
    listing to Osborne Executive ROM Monitor version 1.44 and BIOS code.
    Does someone out there have the Osborne Technical Reference Manuals
    that contains the source code listings?  Can I make some arrangement
    to photocopy or scan them in?

    I have also talked to two people who said they had hard drives in
    their Exec's (when they had them).  Does anybody have any technical
    information on this?

an insufficient memory error and the program aborts.  Any idea how
much TPA this program needs to run?  I am using Montezuma Micro CP/M

I have been able to use the bf2small.com in the bfupdat1.ark. This is
a version which will only to 140 columns and uses less memory.
 
Is this program still being sold?

Nor would I! :-) A Z-Node is a bbs that is devoted to supporting
CP/M and ZCPR. Most are run as RCP/Ms.

Ian, a Z-Node and an RCP/M are not necessarily the same. My system
is both. That is, it is an RCP/M that is dedicated to supporting
CP/M and Z-System users. But as matter of definition, the term
RCP/M refers to a system whereby the users are permitted access
to the CP/M operating system. What they may *find* there depends
on what the system is established to support. Of course, many do
support our operating system, but I've known many RCP/Ms used to
support private businesses, writers' groups, clubs. That was why
I mentioned Z-Nodes.

Support for CP/M does not have to come from a CP/M based machine.
There are people running Z-Nodes (supporting CP/M and ZCPR) from
other platforms. So Z-Nodes are not, by their very nature, RCP/Ms.

This brings us full circle. (1) A Z-Node is a bbs (usually but not
always an RCP/M) to support CP/M and ZCPR. (2) Many RCP/Ms support
CP/M and ZCPR but few outside the United States have been listed,
at least so far as the rest of us would know. Ian Cottrell publishes
a list of RCPMs and Jay Sage releases the list of Z-Nodes. I have
published the Z-Node list in the last two issues of TCJ. The RCP/M
listing is too large to print.

Sysops of either should get their systems listed so that support
for users can be available in their own countries. Jay reads this
news group. His Internet address is SAGE@LL.MIT.EDU. So far as I
know, Ian is not on the net. I can forward mail to him for you. We
need your help in compiling the information! Thanks.

   Yes, it is possible.
 
   on the command line for the compiler add a /O (letter 'O' not a zero)
to tell the compiler to stick RQUEST OBSLIB.REL into the object file,
instead of RQUEST BASLIB.REL.
 
   the linker will instead pull routines out of the OBSLIB.REL library.
These routines do not require the presence of BRUN.COM, and oftentimes will
allow larger programs to execute in less memory.
 
   To do this, you need to have a copy of OBSLIB.REL around somewhere.  It
is a part of the distribution package.
 
   But the downside of this is that there are some commands that are 
implemented in BASLIB.REL that are not implemented in OBSLIB.REL.  Depending
on whether your existing programs use these commands, you might have some
problems getting them to compile to standalone executables.  

   For instance, COMMON is not supported, and CHAIN is semantically equivalent
to a RUN statement.
 
   RUN <linenumber> is not supported.  RUN can only call another *.COM
file.

   The CLEAR command is not supported in any way.

   For large applications, these may cause additional problems.  Implementing
a system of programs that call one another is not easy, since sharing
information is restricted.  What you may end up doing is passing parameters
from one module to another by writing them into a file, and having the target
module check for the presence of that file

   Programs that use CLEAR to allow arrays to be resized will also have
problems.  Arrays cannot be dynamically allocated, as they could with the
interpreter, and array definitions must be integer constants.  Once you
define an array for a program, you cannot delete it or change it.
 
   Hope that helps you...

First, I wanna thank all who have replied to my plea for help. (I don't
know how I get myself into these things!). Second, the consensus seems to
be that I have two birds here; the monitor seems to be in actuality  
something else, a Televideo model 800. The cpu seems to be a Televideo
Model 806. At least that's what those with much more brains than I say
it is. I guess the big problem is that the monitor is looking for a     
"server" to boot up from, and the cpu is trying to boot up period. Somehow
I gotta get the two connected together properly. While the monitor part
has an RS422 connector, the other end of the cable that's connected to it
is connected to the "User 1" port on the cpu. Now, the cpu has a "terminal"
port, but no cable connected to it, and none came with it. It looks to be a
25-pin RS232 connector. Say, do you suppose that I could hook up a dumb
televideo 950 or 925 terminal to that, and t'd fire up? Just a thought....
in the meantine, I guess the big question is, can this monitor and this
cpu be made to work together? (I haven't got a Televideo dumb terminal
anyway!) To those of you who responded to me via here, I'll keep ya'all
posted as to any developments in this saga, please keep feeding me info!
For those of you who sent me email on this, check your mailboxes!

Earl, I have a copy of the MMMOST disk that I am sending to you - I think I
still have your address.  I have Sysgen'd it with the CPM58.COM file that is
on the disk.  Hopefully, it will boot for you.  The only 802 that I have is
the 802H (hard-drive), and I'm not sure it will work.  I'll send it along
also, though, just in case.

Most of the files on the MMMOST disk will probably not be of value, but they
are there anyway for your own amazement, if nothing else.  Keep us posted on

Message-ID: <9460729@ub.cc.umich.edu>

I am using the cpm QTERM comm program with its vt100 emulator to talk to
our mainframe (UB-MTS) full-screen message system.
I am running QTERM on a Kaypro-II, a slow machine.
The problem I am having is that even at 1200 baud  sometimes the vt100 codes
coming in from MTS go by too fast for the Kaypro to keep up, and the screen
gets scrambled.  I checked this out at 300 baud, and at that speed it works
first time, every time, but that is impractical.
 
What I need is either a way to halt input from MTS while the Kaypro processes
the cursor and screen control codes, or a way to patch QTERM with what I believe
is called an "interrupt driver".  I'm just parroting the term, I don't know
what it means.  
 
I have a fast terminal emulator (fastterm.com) that works at high speeds without
dropping characters, apparently because it is interrupt driven.
 
Suggestions are solicited.  Please keep in mind that I relatively ignorant of
these matters, and have almost no experience in working with assembler.  If   
patching is an option you'll have to tell me how, as well as what to patch.
 
Thanks.

I have every clue and I'll see if I can help because I started

You absolultely can NOT do multi-processing with a regular
SoftCard (maybe, and I mean ---MAYBE---, with a SoftCard //e).
It is physically impossible and it isn't feasible if you're
talking about running the two processors running asynchronously
(i.e. running the two processors independently of each other).
When the SoftCard is active, it effectively completely takes over
your whole computer.  It puts the 6502 to sleep and becomes the
main processor for a time.

                  C P / M - 8 0   C O M P I L E R   L I S T
                  =========================================

  This list is an attempt at answering most of the `Can anyone tell me what
the best CP/M compiler for language "foo" is?' questions. Please do not
expect this list to be definitive. I am very much dependent on the information
sent to me, and if nobody mentioned a certain compiler, chances are you won't
find it here. If you know of a compiler that should be in the list, send me
a description.

  Compiler categories:
    I've split up the list into two parts, based on how much info I have on
the compiler concerned. The first list is a list of compilers with some kind
of description, the second list contains compiler only known to me by name.
Please note that 1 (one) line of descriptive comment is enough to make it a
category 1 compiler. ;-)

  Compiler availability:
    Many compilers are still sold, others can only be obtained as an illegal
copy. Also some compilers are public domain, but alas that group is rather
small. I think that, even though many companies are no longer actively
engaged in maintaining their CP/M packages, they will _not_ look kindly on
publicly announced copying. Since I received _no_ communications from
persons working for companies like Borland, Microsoft, and Digital Research,
I wonder if any of them monitor this list. Perhaps we as collective CP/M
users can draw some goodwill, and persuade them to remove some of the copying
restrictions on e.g. binaries.
  I mention the copyright holder when known. "?? PD ??" means that I don't
know, but that they are for sale at such a low rate that I suspect them to
be at least shareware.
  Many Bulletin Boards have interesting software, and Ed Grey not only
runs a BBS, but also sells MIX C and Turbo PASCAL v3. RS components in
England also sells originals materials. I mention these two as example,
undoubtebly there are others with remnants of a large stock. JRT PASCAL,
Prolog-80, Micro-COBOL, Forth-83, Small-C and others are appearently
PD, and can be had from BBSes. PCW world seems to have MBASIC on one of
their disks, but I'm doubtful about their right to do this.

  References:
    I include the names of all those that sent me information on the
compilers, since they are likely to know more if you have questions about
a specific product.

  The rumors:
    Hah! many! I'm forced to reject rumors that Microsoft is no longer
interested: RS components still sells compilers for CP/M+ - including
Macro-80! - for three figure amounts.

   Kinda common on 2Mhz z80 machines...

   well, most mainframes don't have the response time needed to tell them
to stop sending in time.  the interrupt driven approach is the best
alternative, but bear in mind it might not solve the problem.

   most cp/m com programs use an "overlay" to allow the same executable code
to work on different serial port hardware.  your best bet would be to
rewrite the overlay so it does interrupt driven input/output.  the hardware
is definately able to support it.
 
   but the reason why i said this might not work is because interrupt driven
input will allow the terminal/computer to store characters it otherwise would
miss in a circular buffer in RAM.  If the serial port baud rate is too fast
for the processor to handle, then interrupt driven input won't do a scrap of
good.  it will, however, allow your machine to handle the data as fast as
it can when the baud rate is faster than the processor can handle, for short
periods of time.  (like, the the processor is handling those vt100 codes.)
you may find that you'll have to get your mainframe to add nulls to the end
of every line, to give the kaypro time to catch up.
 
   handling interrupt requests on a z80 system (using z80sio chips) is
very straightforward and reading the data sheets will give you all the 
information you need.  (whether it is comprehendable or not is left as
an excercise for the student...  ;)  there are many books on the subject,
if you can still find them.
 
   someone may have already gone ahead and written an interrupt driven 
overlay for QTERM for the kaypro II, so if you can find someone who has one
you may have the easy way out there.
 
   but if you can't find one, i'll help you with it.  I have a kaypro II 83,
which is probably the same thing you have, and could help debug the code.
all you need as a starting point is a virgin copy of the QTERM distribution,
which should have the overlay information in it.

I had a 806 up and running for a while (until the HD gave up of old age).
The idea is that the machine boots either from floppy or from
harddisk. Of course the 806 (a server for up to 6 diskless z80 systems) was
supposed to boot from harddisk all the time. The trick was to simply press
the re-boot button immediately, and then it would try the other device.
I suppose it stored an indication of what was tried last time somewhere
in memory.

So, if you have a reset button on it, try using that.

The 80x series are sufficiently prehistoric _not_ to know something as
auto-configuration. You could try to find the boot ROM's, disassemble
them, find the right spot for correcting the boot device, and make new
EPROM's. ;-)

I certainly can.  I -WROTE- one!  See, the Applied Engineering
Z80 Plus card for the II Plus, //e, IIGS and compatibles are
completely compatible with Microsoft's board.  One board will run
the other's CP/M (CP/AM).  In fact, I have a Microsoft SoftCard
(as in the original, not the SoftCard //e) and I tested the patch
under Applied Engineering's CP/AM 5.1 and it works well.  But you
MUST be using a Super Serial card or something like it, i.e. one
that runs a 6551 at memory locations 0E0x8 through 0E0xB where
x=8H + slot.

Subject: Source for .?Y?
Message-ID: <NaqB51w164w@gnat.rent.com>

ankh@diku..dk (Klaus Ambrass) answered a request for the source code for 
a program to generate ?Y? (LZH) compressed files was in C. Roger Warren 
in San Diego coded CRLZH12.LBR in assembler, which will both compress and 
extract LZH to/from ?Y? files. He did not include the source code as he 
did not feel he was done with his work (or so he stated to me).

I believe Roger is soon to release an update, possibly by the end of the 
summer. Am hopeful he will release the source code at that time.

Meanwhile, since it is not in a high level language, you could 
disassemble. On the other hand, I would suspect not many would understand 
what is going on in there! :-)

I have uploaded to SIMTEL20:

pd2:<cpm.graphics>
BASPLOT.LBR     Regression and Spline functions plot in BASIC

Given a set of experimental points the program will plot the points on either
graphics screen or graphics plotter or will write all command lines into a
data file.  If required, the program will calculate regression coefficients
(8 models) or spline functions coefficients (their first and second derivati-
ves) and will plot these functions.  Source code files (Microsoft BASCOM Com-
piler v.5.3) can be easily modified to suit.  Literature references are given
where appropriate.

pd2:<cpm.asmutl>
ASMLIB.LBR      Library of .ASM routines and utilities

This is a collection of .asm routines which are compatible with Digital
Research macro assembler, linker and librarian (RMAC, LINK, and LIB).  The
routines include miscelaneous functions (read and write clock, RAM tests,
monitor, read analogue to digital channel, etc.), screen functions, character
string functions, conversions, simple maths and numeric printing.  Utilities
for manipulation of binary files, reading and writing EPROMs (27.. series),
and terminal setup utility.

Have a person with an H89 and a Magnolia disc controller.  As far as he knows
he has only used hard sectored disks.  No manuals to be found, etc, etc, etc.

It seems like I remember, back in the days when I had my 89 running, that the
Magnolia would support soft sectored disks.

Can anyone tell me if it is possible to pull a jumper or flip a dip switch
and get the Magnolia to use soft sectored disks?  It would be nice to see the

Please reply by email if possible

I have something you might call a manual, but it was for the TRS-80/TRS-DOS

Small-c is just a stripped down C; no floats/doubles, strict old style K&R.

The only important thing is compatibility. Small-c produces M80 assembly.
The library (did you get it in source?) is probably an L80 ".REL" file.

UZI was written for a fairly complete compiler. I forgot, sorry. Maybe
somebody else knows more (the author of UZI? ;-)).

This is not so much of a problem. What is a problem (and see the next article
in this group) is hardware/software prerequisites, what cpm support is needed,
how to install it, what constitutes, in short, a fully-configured environment
in which the thing has to run.

For example, while smc211 outputs l80/m80 code, an earlier version (203)
makes LASM/MLOAD code. However, it writes the assembler output on stdout
and as far as I can tell there is no I/O redirection in CPM. And no way to
specify an output file name for the compiler!

This sort of hijinks by software makes life very difficult...

Hello Bill? Any comments? 

Lets follow this up by mail 'with an expectation of privacy' :-)

The library source is there, but given the difficulties mentioned above
I can't quite see what to do with it yet. Also, one would presumably need a 
library manager along the lines of Borland TLIB to make alternate libraries.

>>4. Whether any other CPM utilities are required, and where they are.
>Just an editor.

See last point. How are relocateable libraries made under CPM? For different
assembler/linker combinations?

>UZI was written for a fairly complete compiler. I forgot, sorry. Maybe

OK, so if anyone knows a better way to go, speak up! I am trying to do this
with all PD/shareware software since one _cannot_ buy cpm software in this 
country any more (as far as I know), and in any case, it seems silly to 
actually spend _real money_ on this stuff!

I've had a look at the ASMUTL stuff at wuarchive, does anyone know if any
of these assembler/linker packages will replace L80/M80? 

And so on...I must be mad!

Well, here is my standard UZI plug, from about a year ago.  It mentions
the compiler I used.  Note that I am very close to releasing UZI-280,
which is ten times cooler than UZI, assuming you have a Z280 computer.

UZI is presumably still on SIMTEL20, and probably other places as well.





		UZI: UNIX Z-80 IMPLEMENTATION

		  Written by Douglas Braun


Introduction:

UZI is an implementation of the Unix kernel written for a Z-80 based
computer.  It implementts almost all of the functionality of the
7th Edition Unix kernel.  UZI was written to run on one specific
collection of custom-built hardware, but since it can easily have device
drivers added to it, and it does not use any memory management hardware,
it should be possible to port it to numerous computers that current use
the CP/M operating system.  The source code is written mostly in C,
and was compiled with The Code Works' Q/C compiler.  UZI's code was
written from scratch, and contains no AT&T code, so it is not subject
to any of AT&T's copyright or licensing restrictions.  Numerous 7th
Edition programs have been ported to UZI with little or no difficulty,
including the complete Bourne shell, ed, sed, dc, cpp, etc.


How it works:

Since there is no standard memory management hardware on 8080-family
computers, UZI uses "total swapping" to achieve multiprocessing.
This has two implications:  First, UZI requires a reasonably fast
hard disk.  Second, there is no point in running a different process
while a process is waiting for disk I/O.  This simplifies the design
of the block device drivers, since they do not have to be interrupt-based.

UZI itself occupies the upper 32K of memory, and the currently running
process occupies the lower 32K.   Since UZI currently barely fits in 32K,
a full 64K of RAM is necessary.

UZI does need some additional hardware support.  First, there must be
some sort of clock or timer that can provide a periodic interrupt.
Also, the current implementation uses an additional real-time clock
to get the time for file timestamps, etc.  The current TTY driver assumes
an interrupt-driven keyboard, which should exist on most systems.
The distribution contains code for hard and floppy disk drivers, but
since these were written for custom hardware, they are provided only
as templates to write new ones.


How UZI is different than real Unix:

UZI implements almost all of the 7th Edition functionality.
All file I/O, directories, mountable file systems, user and group IDs,
pipes, and applicable device I/O are supported.  Process control
(fork(), execve(), signal(), kill(), pause(), alarm(), and wait()) are fully
supported.  The number of processes is limited only by the swap space
available.  As mentioned above,  UZI implements Unix well enough to
run the Bourne shell in its full functionality.  The only changes made
to the shell's source code were to satisfy the limitations of the C compiler.

Here is a (possibly incomplete) list of missing features and limitations:

    The debugger- and profiler-related system calls do not exist.

    The old 6th edition seek() was implemented, instead of lseek().

    The supplied TTY driver is bare-bones.  It supports only one port,
    and most IOCTLs are not supported.

    Inode numbers are only 16-bit, so filesystems are 32 Meg or less.

    File dates are not in the standard format.  Instead they look like
    those used by MS-DOS.

    The 4.2BSD execve() was implemented.  Additional flavors of exec()
    are supported by the library.

    The format of the device driver switch table is unlike that of
    the 7th Edition.

    The necessary semaphores and locking mechanisms to implement 
    reentrant disk I/O are not there.  This would make it harder to
    implement interrupt-driven disk I/O without busy-waiting.


A Description of this Release:

Here is a list of the files supplied, and a brief description of each:


intro:		What you are reading

config.h:	Setup parameters, such as table sizes, and the device
		driver switch table.

unix.h:		All strcuture declarations, typedefs and defines.
		(Includes things like errno.h).

extern.h:	Declarations of all global variables and tables.

data.c:		Dummy to source extern.h and devine globals.

dispatch.c:	System call dispatch table.

scall1.c:	System calls, mostly file-related.

scall2.c:	Rest of system calls.

filesys.c:	Routines for managing file system.

process.c:	Routines for process management and context switching.
		Somewhat machine-dependent.

devio.c:	Generic I/O routines, including queue routines.

devtty.c:	Simple TTY driver, slightly-machine dependent.

devwd.c:	Hard disk driver.  Very machine-dependent.

devflop.c:	Floppy disk driver.  Very machine-dependent.

devmisc.c:	Simple device drivers, such as /dev/mem.

machdep.c:	Machine-dependent code, especially real-time-clock and
		interrupt handling code.

extras.c:	Procedures missing from the Q/C compiler's library.

filler.mac:	Dummy to make linker load UZI at correct address.

makeunix.sub:	CP/M SUBMIT file to compile everything.

loadunix.sub:	CP/M SUBMIT file to load everything.


Miscellaneous Notes:

UZI was compiled with the Code Works Q/C C compiler and the Microsoft
M80 assembler under the CP/M operating system, on the same hardware
it runs on.  Also used was a version of cpp ported to CP/M, since
the Q/C compiler does not handle macros with arguments.  However, there
are only a couple of these in the code, and they could easily be removed.

Because UZI occupies the upper 32K of memory, the standard L80 linker
could not be used to link it.  Instead, a homebrew L80 replacement linker
was used.  This generated a 64K-byte CP/M .COM file, which has the lower 
32K pruned by the CP/M PIP utility.  This is the reason for appearance
of the string "MOMBASSA" in filler.mac and loadunix.sub.

To boot UZI, a short CP/M program was run that reads in the UZI image,
copies it to the upper 32K of memory, and jumps to its start address.
Other CP/M programs were written to build, inspect, and check UZI filesystems
under CP/M.  These made it possible to have a root file system made before
starting up UZI.  If the demand exists, these programs can be included
in another release.


Running programs under UZI:

A number of 7th Edition, System V, and 4.2BSD programs were ported to
UZI.  Most notably, the Bourne shell and ed run fine under UZI.
In addition the 4.2BSD stdio library was also ported.  This, along
with the Code Works Q/C library and miscellaneous System V library 
functions, was used when porting programs.

Due to obvious legal reasons, the source or executables for most of these
programs cannot be released.  However, some kernel-dependent programs
such as ps and fsck were written from scratch and can be included in future
releases.  Also, a package was created that can be linked to CP/M .COM
files that will allow them to run under UZI.  This was used to get
the M80 assembler and L80 linker to run under UZI.  Cpp was also
ported to UZI.  However, it was not possible to fit the Q/C compiler
into 32K, so all programs (and UZI itself) were cross-compiled under CP/M.

The Minix operating system, written for PCs by Andrew Tanenbaum et al,
contains many programs that should compile and run under UZI.  Since
Minix is much less encumbered by licensing provisions than real Unix,
it would make sense to port Minix programs to UZI.  In fact, UZI itself
could be ported to the PC, and used as a replacement for the Minix kernel.

Can anyone recommend a small but useful editor ? 
I've been using Turbo Pascal as an editor, but I feel it's overkill
for short programs/files (note: I don't want line editors, eg ED,
just screen editors. Multiple files would be a bonus :)

I've seen UZI mentioned a lot in this group, but I've never
seen anything that really indicates what it is.
So, what is it ? 
What sort of CP/M machine does it require ? Hard disk, 1 or 2 floppies ?
56/128 k RAM ?

Also, can anyone answer the same questions for ZCPR3.3 ...I know
it's a replacement for the CCP, but I looked in the
ZCPR3.3 directory on wuarchivel.wustl.edu - there are a _lot_
of files there ... what are they all ? are they all needed ?
Will they run on any CP/M machine, do they depend
on being patched for each particular machine ??

<whew> Well, that's all (for now)
It might be best to e-mail replies to dcook@spam.adelaide.edu.au,
and if anyone else is as ignorant about CP/M as me ( :-), I'll summarize.

(the amazing thing is, I've been in an information vacuum w.r.t. CP/M
for 6 years now ! Especially in hearing about latest developments)

Well, the one I know of is called CRR0110.ZIP.  I can .uue it to you 
if you can undo that.  It allows you to use XRS mailers a.k.a. a few
other names as well.  A fellow in the UK has written it; actually, IS
writing it.  has gone thru 3 revs from CRR0030 since last October...

Let us know if you want it.   I post this so others can see if they want to
try it too...

BTW it is a memory hog.  I have to strip out my HD RSX so it can run.

Well, here is my standard UZI plug, from about a year ago.  It mentions
the compiler I used.  Note that I am very close to releasing UZI-280,
which is ten times cooler than UZI, assuming you have a Z280 computer.

UZI is presumably still on SIMTEL20, and probably other places as well.





		UZI: UNIX Z-80 IMPLEMENTATION

		  Written by Douglas Braun


Introduction:

UZI is an implementation of the Unix kernel written for a Z-80 based
computer.  It implementts almost all of the functionality of the
7th Edition Unix kernel.  UZI was written to run on one specific
collection of custom-built hardware, but since it can easily have device
drivers added to it, and it does not use any memory management hardware,
it should be possible to port it to numerous computers that current use
the CP/M operating system.  The source code is written mostly in C,
and was compiled with The Code Works' Q/C compiler.  UZI's code was
written from scratch, and contains no AT&T code, so it is not subject
to any of AT&T's copyright or licensing restrictions.  Numerous 7th
Edition programs have been ported to UZI with little or no difficulty,
including the complete Bourne shell, ed, sed, dc, cpp, etc.


How it works:

Since there is no standard memory management hardware on 8080-family
computers, UZI uses "total swapping" to achieve multiprocessing.
This has two implications:  First, UZI requires a reasonably fast
hard disk.  Second, there is no point in running a different process
while a process is waiting for disk I/O.  This simplifies the design
of the block device drivers, since they do not have to be interrupt-based.

UZI itself occupies the upper 32K of memory, and the currently running
process occupies the lower 32K.   Since UZI currently barely fits in 32K,
a full 64K of RAM is necessary.

UZI does need some additional hardware support.  First, there must be
some sort of clock or timer that can provide a periodic interrupt.
Also, the current implementation uses an additional real-time clock
to get the time for file timestamps, etc.  The current TTY driver assumes
an interrupt-driven keyboard, which should exist on most systems.
The distribution contains code for hard and floppy disk drivers, but
since these were written for custom hardware, they are provided only
as templates to write new ones.


How UZI is different than real Unix:

UZI implements almost all of the 7th Edition functionality.
All file I/O, directories, mountable file systems, user and group IDs,
pipes, and applicable device I/O are supported.  Process control
(fork(), execve(), signal(), kill(), pause(), alarm(), and wait()) are fully
supported.  The number of processes is limited only by the swap space
available.  As mentioned above,  UZI implements Unix well enough to
run the Bourne shell in its full functionality.  The only changes made
to the shell's source code were to satisfy the limitations of the C compiler.

Here is a (possibly incomplete) list of missing features and limitations:

    The debugger- and profiler-related system calls do not exist.

    The old 6th edition seek() was implemented, instead of lseek().

    The supplied TTY driver is bare-bones.  It supports only one port,
    and most IOCTLs are not supported.

    Inode numbers are only 16-bit, so filesystems are 32 Meg or less.

    File dates are not in the standard format.  Instead they look like
    those used by MS-DOS.

    The 4.2BSD execve() was implemented.  Additional flavors of exec()
    are supported by the library.

    The format of the device driver switch table is unlike that of
    the 7th Edition.

    The necessary semaphores and locking mechanisms to implement 
    reentrant disk I/O are not there.  This would make it harder to
    implement interrupt-driven disk I/O without busy-waiting.


A Description of this Release:

Here is a list of the files supplied, and a brief description of each:


intro:		What you are reading

config.h:	Setup parameters, such as table sizes, and the device
		driver switch table.

unix.h:		All strcuture declarations, typedefs and defines.
		(Includes things like errno.h).

extern.h:	Declarations of all global variables and tables.

data.c:		Dummy to source extern.h and devine globals.

dispatch.c:	System call dispatch table.

scall1.c:	System calls, mostly file-related.

scall2.c:	Rest of system calls.

filesys.c:	Routines for managing file system.

process.c:	Routines for process management and context switching.
		Somewhat machine-dependent.

devio.c:	Generic I/O routines, including queue routines.

devtty.c:	Simple TTY driver, slightly-machine dependent.

devwd.c:	Hard disk driver.  Very machine-dependent.

devflop.c:	Floppy disk driver.  Very machine-dependent.

devmisc.c:	Simple device drivers, such as /dev/mem.

machdep.c:	Machine-dependent code, especially real-time-clock and
		interrupt handling code.

extras.c:	Procedures missing from the Q/C compiler's library.

filler.mac:	Dummy to make linker load UZI at correct address.

makeunix.sub:	CP/M SUBMIT file to compile everything.

loadunix.sub:	CP/M SUBMIT file to load everything.


Miscellaneous Notes:

UZI was compiled with the Code Works Q/C C compiler and the Microsoft
M80 assembler under the CP/M operating system, on the same hardware
it runs on.  Also used was a version of cpp ported to CP/M, since
the Q/C compiler does not handle macros with arguments.  However, there
are only a couple of these in the code, and they could easily be removed.

Because UZI occupies the upper 32K of memory, the standard L80 linker
could not be used to link it.  Instead, a homebrew L80 replacement linker
was used.  This generated a 64K-byte CP/M .COM file, which has the lower 
32K pruned by the CP/M PIP utility.  This is the reason for appearance
of the string "MOMBASSA" in filler.mac and loadunix.sub.

To boot UZI, a short CP/M program was run that reads in the UZI image,
copies it to the upper 32K of memory, and jumps to its start address.
Other CP/M programs were written to build, inspect, and check UZI filesystems
under CP/M.  These made it possible to have a root file system made before
starting up UZI.  If the demand exists, these programs can be included
in another release.


Running programs under UZI:

A number of 7th Edition, System V, and 4.2BSD programs were ported to
UZI.  Most notably, the Bourne shell and ed run fine under UZI.
In addition the 4.2BSD stdio library was also ported.  This, along
with the Code Works Q/C library and miscellaneous System V library 
functions, was used when porting programs.

Due to obvious legal reasons, the source or executables for most of these
programs cannot be released.  However, some kernel-dependent programs
such as ps and fsck were written from scratch and can be included in future
releases.  Also, a package was created that can be linked to CP/M .COM
files that will allow them to run under UZI.  This was used to get
the M80 assembler and L80 linker to run under UZI.  Cpp was also
ported to UZI.  However, it was not possible to fit the Q/C compiler
into 32K, so all programs (and UZI itself) were cross-compiled under CP/M.

The Minix operating system, written for PCs by Andrew Tanenbaum et al,
contains many programs that should compile and run under UZI.  Since
Minix is much less encumbered by licensing provisions than real Unix,
it would make sense to port Minix programs to UZI.  In fact, UZI itself
could be ported to the PC, and used as a replacement for the Minix kernel.

Dear all,
  Now and again the question of available CP/M compilers pops up.
Lately this keeps centering around C compilers and Macro assemblers,
but I think it would be nice to get a more general overview.

  Now I'm strictly CP/M-80 (2.2/3) myself, but I suppose we've got an
audience with also CP/M-68k and CP/M-86 users. Undoubtebly the latter
versions have more coplete implementations, but let's see anyway.

Some compilers I can drag from memory:
  C: Small-c, BDS-C
  Pascal: Turbo-Pascal v3, Pascal/MT+
  BASIC: MBASIC (interpreter), CBASIC
  Assembly: M80, ASM (CP/M 1/2 standard), MAC/RMAC (CP/M 3 standard)
  Modula-2 (by rumor)
  Ada (sounds like a nightmare, but anyway)
  PL/M (never seen one, but the BDOS interface (parameters in BC/DE) is
    based on a PL/M convention)

  I would like to collect information about any compiler you can think of
that runs on CP/M machines, and I'll summarize the results. Preferably
I'ld like to get entries as this one:

  Language: C
  Compiler name: BDS-C version ??, Copyright holder: BD Software
  Status: sold???, last checked: 198?, where: computer shop
  Remarks: No floating point, K&R
  Minimal system: CP/M-80, 48k, floppy.

Especially the status of a package will be interesting. I doubt if many
shops still sell CP/M software, and the big question is: `how far can we
go?'

  Please mail your answers to me (laverman@cs.rug.nl). I'll let it
collect for maybe two weeks, and then compile a list.

Greetings, Bert

I have been using version 2.03 of Small C from Simtel20 for some
time now with no difficulties.  Contrary to the above extract,
the compiler does support I/O redirection, in compiling and when
running programs generated by the compiler.  I use the LASM
version of the compiler. Using the link directive, the need to
copy the iolib.asm and call.asm files to the end of the compiler
output is unnecessary.  I also have a doc file for the compiler
that is not part of smc203.ark.
 
Redirection of i/o in Small C works as shown in the K+R book:
 
A>cc80a program.c >program.asm
 
would compile program.c to program.asm.
 
A>program <input.txt >output.txt
 
would run program.com created by Small C and LASM, with input
taken from file input.txt and output sent to file output.txt.
 
If you are interested in discussing Small C, please let me know.

I wasn't aware that there existed any LZH-cruncher in CP/M (now I am).
And where please can I get a copy of CRLZH12.LBR? Site addr, mail addr,

You can say that again. I've been looking into it a bit and found a lot of
incomprehensible (sp?) stuff. Mind you, that the process of compacting data
was explained to me twice and it sounded sooooo easy, but that, when faced
with the actual code, I'd have to give up. I simply couldn't remember a
thing, and so far I haven't had any luck in finding any literature on it

In answer to a question from someone looking for a small handy editor, I use
something called VDE which takes up 10k of disk space (very nice) and has
WS-like commands, but produces regular ascii files, with cr's if you set a
right margin for auto-wrap.  It's not perfect, but it's very nice especially
for editing small command files and the like.
 
By the way, if any of you know where docs are, let me know.  There are a few
things I haven't been able to figure out, such as what the printing options
are, and how to use the split window function.

Subject: Info needed on .LBR file format
Message-ID: <1991Jul15.190307.17707@unx.sas.com>

I have an .LBR file of a PD FORTH (F83), that I would need to read, but I
do not have an .LBR file reader. I am not normally a CPM'er, but I do have
access to several Z80 systems I would like to put the FORTH on (there is
some source in the file I am told).

The problem is that I do not know how to read the file.... Any documentation
on the file format, or perhaps a reader (written in C, Pascal, Fortran, or
someother high level language available on my Unix workstation) is available.

Please help, since I need the FORTH source for a project that is already 
over-due (local area robotics contest).

BTW: If anyone has source to a PD Z80 FORTH system that they could email me,
     please let me know....

CRR works with XRS-Door (was RAX/QMX/etc.).

CRR is on SIMTEL if anyone is interested <CPM.BBS>.

Yes, CRR is still being developed. It was started in Easter 1990, 
and there's a group of CPM users on the local bulletin board who 
won't let me stop tweaking it.

> BTW it is a memory hog.  I have to strip out my HD RSX so it can run.

Yes, it needs 42K. I've tried as hard as I can to keep the 
requirements down (overlays), and the distribution versions have 
only 4K of space for the Turbo Pascal heap...

It's shareware. (Only 7 registrations in the whole year it's been 
released 8-( ).

Bug reports, suggestions, (dare I say it) registrations welcomed.

I have the full LBR for VDE version 2.66 on my Z-Node in central New 
Jersey. You can connect at (908) 754-9067 or through PCP (NJNBR) or 
Starlink (3319) at up to 2400 bps. Also have ZDE, which is VDE updated 
for Z-System.

You'd be better off using ZDE which is more up-to-date than VDE
(the author of VDE doesn't support CP/M anymore) and is ZCPR3
compatible.

Subject: How to upload files to SIMTEL20
Message-ID: <W8SDZ.12702110105.BABYL@WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL>

I have received many inquiries about why SIMTEL20 does not publish
instructions for uploading files for those who wish to submit their
programs.  The reason is that we prefer to coordinate uploads by
having contributors contact us first so we can check to make sure the
program is not already in the repository.

File uploads are accepted via FTP using a special uploading account,
or via e-mail using a special mailbox which does not interfere with
regular correspondence.

If you have a program to upload please send e-mail to me with a short
description of the files you wish to submit.  Please do *not* send
files to my mailbox.  Because of local management policy, SIMTEL20
does not accept games for submission to the archives unless they are
strictly educational.

Thanks to all those who are actively supporting the respository by
helping us keep up to date with the latest programs.

Subject: Looking for Kaypro 4 software
Message-ID: <1991Jul17.003820.7010@ncsu.edu>

Hello,

  I own an old Kaypro 4, still running CP/M 2.2, and am looking to find
two things: One: a ZModem up/download program and an uncompresser for
*.?Z? files (like FILENAME.CZM) . Simtel-20 doesn't recognize me, and
won't let me in.

Also, does anyone still sell the graphics chips for the old (pre-'84)
Kaypro IIs and 4s, I'd kind of like to be able to do VT-100 codes with
my Kaypro, so that I don't have to scrounge for adm3a or vt52 codes for
my sysops.

I have uploaded to SIMTEL20:

pd2:<cpm.graphics>
BASPLOT.LBR     Regression and Spline functions plot in BASIC

Given a set of experimental points the program will plot the points on either
graphics screen or graphics plotter or will write all command lines into a
data file.  If required, the program will calculate regression coefficients
(8 models) or spline functions coefficients (their first and second derivati-
ves) and will plot these functions.  Source code files (Microsoft BASCOM Com-
piler v.5.3) can be easily modified to suit.  Literature references are given
where appropriate.

pd2:<cpm.asmutl>
ASMLIB.LBR      Library of .ASM routines and utilities

This is a collection of .asm routines which are compatible with Digital
Research macro assembler, linker and librarian (RMAC, LINK, and LIB).  The
routines include miscelaneous functions (read and write clock, RAM tests,
monitor, read analogue to digital channel, etc.), screen functions, character
string functions, conversions, simple maths and numeric printing.  Utilities
for manipulation of binary files, reading and writing EPROMs (27.. series),
and terminal setup utility.

The following is a message from the ASMLIB.LBR author:

To Whom It May Concern (CP/M users)

The following 5 programs are hereby placed into the public domain 
for  free usage with the sole restriction that the authors  name, 
Richard C Holmes, and company copyright messages are not changed. 

In other words, we wrote the programs and are happy to anyone who 
wants to use them to do so as long as we are remembered! 

There  shall  be no fee charged for this software  by  any  third 
party or company or department. This software is free to the  end 
user. 

ASMLIB    A source library of assembler routines put together  to 
          assist in writing programs in 8080 and TDL version  Z80 
          assembler.  Assemble  with RMAC or uss the  source  for 
          your own reasons.
          The  main reason (for me) for writing this library  was 
          to  provide a configurable set of screen  driver  codes 
          (ie  cursor address, half intensity etc etc). This  was 
          done by putting a key-code at the start of the table of 
          attribute codes which another program searches for  and 
          patches  directly. So, you can patch  programs  written 
          with ASMLIB to suit most terminals.
          Other  functions in the library such as a  simple  time 
          delay,  CRC  generator, cursor addressing  and  message 
          printing make ASMLIB cute and simple to use.

FP        A  screen  oriented file patcher. Does a  neat  job  of 
          patching in ascii or hex and has a host of options etc. 

PROM150   A premium program for programming EPROMS on SME Systems 
          (bet  you never heard of us!) or S.D.  Systems  Prom100 
          cards. If you are this far into eprom programming  then 
          you should be able to figure out that for the 2764  and 
          bigger  eproms  you need an adaptor. Contact me  for  a 
          circuit diagram etc.

SETUP     A  program  that  directly patches  (wow!)  the  screen 
          driver codes in .COM files that use the ASMLIB program. 
          This  program should be accompanied by a (small?)  data 
          base  of  available  screen setup codes  which  can  be 
          edited and added to etc.

TATT      A program to TEST setup and ASMLIB screen drivers.

PS. If  anyone  out  there is doing development work  on  a  CP/M 
    system  for the '64180 chip and uses RMAC then I have my  own 
    source  for another library of functions including  interrupt 
    redirection etc. This is intended for embedded systems only.

How about posting it to SIMTEL20 (if that'd be OK with the author) so we can
all check it out/enjoy it/use it?  Keith Peterson is still the moderator,
and he still follows this group.  You can also find instructions on how
to post to SIMTEL20 in the (ack) comp.binaries.ibm.pc.archives group.

I used to have a copy of a Kapyro flight simulator program.

It was basically an instruments only landing simulatoion. I have lost my
copy, and canot even recall the name. If anyone knows where to find it
Please let me know. (you might guess I'm tryoing to get things working
again on this old dino. It been running hard since Christmas, 1983, with only
one major problem (Disk head on A drive gave out in '89).

I believe so.  I wrote it...  I'll post it for those who are
interested, but I can't right now because the PC I'm using, which
I'm borrowing from a friend, is running hard drives only.  I'll
post it soon.

Rembrandt is still available from Central Computer Products for the
your Kaypro. The graphics program with a new ROM chip is $49. Rembrandt
is a graphics presentation software package. It includes on screen
drafting, both free hand and data graphing, as well as fancy printer
drivers to make hard copy presentations. Central Computer Products can
be contacted:

	330 Central Avenue
	Fillmore California 93015
	(805) 542-4189

I have no relationship with either the makers of Rembrandt or Central
Computer products other than as a satisfied customer.

David, you want ZMP15 for Zmodem. Don't be fooled by the 'Z' in the name. 
That refers to 'Zmodem' and not 'ZCPR' or 'Z-System'. It is a CP/M 
implementation of Zmodem in C, written by Ron Murray in Australia.

The 'uncompressor' you want is in either CRUNCH28.LBR or CRLZHnn.LBR 
(last CRLZH I have is version 1.1 but I think 1.2 is out). Either or both 
are readily available on Z-Nodes around the country. You can find them on 
my CRUNCH: directory on Z-Node 32 at (908) 754-9067. Use the NJNBR (for 
PC Pursuit) or 3319 (for StarLink) outdials if you have either service.
I have ZMP15.LBR on the MODEM: directory, if memory serves me right.

Which country ? Please remember that this is an *international*

and I sure *don't* want to pay the phone bill
for calling one from Australia :-)

Besides, I got CRLZH from wuarchive.wustl.edu, (which mirrors
the wsmr-simtel20.army.mil archives of CP/M, MS-DOS, and
other software), via anonymous ftp, from the directory
mirrors/cpm/squsq, file crlzh11.lbr.

1. I just got a Kaypro 4, it has a Kaypro 4 case, and a 'non-glare' screen over the monitor...  it also has a Turbo modification... BUT it appears to be a kaypro ][! when it boots it says 'Kaypro II' and some Kaypro 4 programs don't seem to work on it... 

  What is the difference on the motherboard between a Kaypro 2 and 4?
  Also, could someone post a uuencoded ROM 'image' (ie bin file, or HEX...or asm that I can assemble...but I PREFER one already assembled, linked, and split into seperate image files)

Hi, everyone! 

I am looking for a hard drive that was made specifically for the Actrix, or
Access Matrix CP/M computer.  I know that this was a 10 meg hard drive with
Xebec HPIB controller in it.  Unfortunately, I do not know the model number
of the controller.  Anyhow, if anybody got that drive and is willing to sell
it, please let me know.  I would settle for a box with working controller
and bad drive.

If it's what I THINK it is, it is not a Kapyro specific program, but an ASCII
based instrument flight simulator.  It's called Instrument Flight if I remember
right.  I have it (on a Xerox 820-II), and it's not bad at all.

Last I knew, you could get it from Central Computer Products for around $30.
Elliam Associates might also have it.  In any case, they are both sources where
you can still get CP/M software.

CRUNCH28 will certainly do it for him, Chris, but I think that EXL (which I
sent him in uue form) is a better choice since it handles libraries as well.

Where can one get ZDE?  I had been using VDE, and like it moderately 
so.  Is ZDE ZCPR 3.0 capable?  (rather than 3.4 or 4.0 or whatever...)

As long as I'm wandering about in the quicksand of editors... is there 
a vi-clone for CP/M?

Well, that list is bogus.  Z-node #50 has not been in existance for at least
two years. . .   

I remember calling it in late '89 only to find it disconnected.

The good news is that:  Z-node 62, run by Lindsay Allen & Ron Murray
is going quite nicely.  They are even on Fido-net.  If anyone wants the
ZN62 Fido-net node number, I'll get it for them!

Mr. McEwen seems to have forgotten that there are sites called
"RCP/Ms".  Not everyone who runs a CP/M BBS necessarily runs a
Z-Node, Chris.  In fact, the RCP/M is the direct ancestor to the
Z-Nodes.  Don't also forget that Z-Nodes are, by their very
nature, RCP/Ms.

I have the full LBR for VDE version 2.66 on my Z-Node in central New 
Jersey. You can connect at (908) 754-9067 or through PCP (NJNBR) or 
Starlink (3319) at up to 2400 bps. Also have ZDE, which is VDE updated 
for Z-System.

It is probably either an 802H or 803H.  Perhaps Ed Grey, who frequents these

Is there anything that might tell the model? I know the 806 prints dots
while it is waiting for the harddisk to come up. Does it have a reset
button? try pressing it, maybe it'll switch over to the floppy drive.
(the 806 does this)

Sounds to me like your machine is configured to a satellite machine on a
Mmmost network. It's looking to boot from the network server rather than from
a local disk. There's a dipswitch that controls whether or not it does that,
but I haven't the foggiest which.

Assuming it's an 802 or 803, that is...

Message-ID: <9107220910.AA07810@nextasy2.eecs.wsu.edu>

i have to get rid of the following two systems, as soon as possible.  i am
not looking to get rich, merely to cover some of my initial investment
(i only have about $250 invested total) 
and give these systems a good home.  otherwise they get junked.

system #1:  a tei 18-slot motherboard, case, powersupply.  several boards,
including z80 cpu, probably 32-48k ram, (on multiple 8k boards, blech),
a custom disk controller (no drives though), and a 2sio/2pio board.  this
has been tested briefly, just to verify that it powers up and run zapple
properly.

system #2:  a running ccs system.  humongous power supply and case, 18-20
slot motherboard.  disk controller, two 8" drives.  5 serial ports.  64k
ram.  all cards are ccs boards.  most of the documentation on most of the
cards.  bios source, (etc) but i can't currently generate a new system (just
copy bootable disks and modify disk sectors manually to change the bios).
the disk drives are dsdd (1.2 megs).  10-15 1.2 meg disks filled with stuff;
another 30 or so low density (256k) disks.  disk case.

i am in a hurry right now, so i won't go into detail.  send me email and i can
give a complete summary of parts, with factory part numbers.  system #2 has
worked very well for me over the past few years, but i have reached a point
where i can no longer fit everything i own into my  pickup truck so i have
to ditch some of it.  make me an offer and its yours.  you will have to worry
about shipping charges; these suckers weight a ton.  hell, make me a semi
decent offer on system #2 and you can have #1 for a song.  you will probably
have to pay more for postage or shipping than anything else... unless you
are anywhere near pullman, washington (oh, yeah, right!)

please don't make me junk these...  both motherboards are excellent for
prototyping, but who has time for that kind of stuff???

anyway, contact me by email:

Hi all,

  My compiler survey did get some results, but I would like to
extend the list a little before posting it. particularly, there are
several compilers/packages mentioned by name only.

  Can anyone give me info on:

	FTL Modula-2 (also mentioned as Hisoft FTL Modula-2)
	Turbo Modula-2 (heard about it in comp.lang.modula2)
	Pro Pascal
	Janus/Ada C-Pack (Is that Ada, or just the manufacturers' name??)
	JRT Pascal

  Several remarks were made about Microsoft not caring anymore about
their products. Anyone from Microsoft on the list?

  RS (I suppose that is Radio Shack aka Tandy) in Australia seems to sell
quite some stuff for 3-figure amounts (Australian $). Anyone from Tandy in
the US on-line?

I believe I just said that.  I've been using ZCPR33 for a long
time (about a year and a half) and have had no problems with ZDE.
BTW, are you running ZCPR 3.0?  If so, you'd be better off
running ZCPR 3.3.  It's MUCH better than 3.0.  You don't have to
change your Z3BASE.LIB file.

I am pretty sure you have snagged one of the "network" stations from an
old TeleVideo system.  The dots you see are the machine waiting for the
network to respond via the RS422 port.  Someplace inside the machine is
a switch you can throw to defeat this portion of the BIOS, and force the
machine to run standalone.  I used a system like this about 10 years ago,
right before IBM announced the PC.  I don't have any of the docs, so I 
can't even begin to suggest which switch to play with.  I think I DO have
some of the original 5.25 disks around here someplace.  I'll see if there's
any documentation on them.  I think the OS was called MMMOST, or something
like that.  It was basically CP/M, made "easy" for idiots.

From the rear connection description, it sounds more like the server without
the hard drive.  Earl, is there open space for a hard drive or is it covered
with a blank panel?  Are the two ribbon cables and edge connectors for a hard
disk installed?  Do they connect to *anything* if so? 

No, don't characterize it as junk - at least not yet!

You might ask for more information at the Dino(saur) SIG of the San Diego

  Sure.  Just add the /O switch when you call BASCOM.  
  eg.  bascom=ziffle /o

Hey, this is amazing!! The 800 really IS a diskless mmmost client! At
least, I haven't seen any with another way of running. It wants the
server to send over the CP/M image.
  However, I'm starting to get confused about your description. Not
the 800, but the 806 SERVER has 6 connections on its back!, and didn't
you mention an empty spot where a harddisk could have been. Could it
be you have BOTH an 806 AND an 800, and didn't know BOTH have a Z80?
The 800 looks remarkably like a Tvi-950 terminal, and it is VERY easy
to mistake it for a dumb terminal!

P.S. if this is the case, you'ld better find an 806 WITH a harddisk
before you can do something with it. Earlyer version had a a small
HD (10 MB unformatted, about 7.5MB usable space), later versions
sported a slim-line TEAC floppy drive, and still later versions
had a 20MB HD.

              some addition built in functions.

    I have schematics and just about have the artwork for the memory
    board done.  However to get 2 and 3 above accomplished, I need the
    listing to Osborne Executive ROM Monitor version 1.44 and BIOS code.
    Does someone out there have the Osborne Technical Reference Manuals
    that contains the source code listings?  Can I make some arrangement
    to photocopy or scan them in?

    I have also talked to two people who said they had hard drives in
    their Exec's (when they had them).  Does anybody have any technical
    information on this?

Hello,
 
Has anyone used the Bradford printing program available from Simtel20
in <cpm.list> as brad2-a.ark?  When I try to run bradford.com I get
an insufficient memory error and the program aborts.  Any idea how
much TPA this program needs to run?  I am using Montezuma Micro CP/M
on my TRS-80 Model 4.
 
I have been able to use the bf2small.com in the bfupdat1.ark. This is
a version which will only to 140 columns and uses less memory.
 
Is this program still being sold?

Nor would I! :-) A Z-Node is a bbs that is devoted to supporting
CP/M and ZCPR. Most are run as RCP/Ms.

Ian, a Z-Node and an RCP/M are not necessarily the same. My system
is both. That is, it is an RCP/M that is dedicated to supporting
CP/M and Z-System users. But as matter of definition, the term
RCP/M refers to a system whereby the users are permitted access
to the CP/M operating system. What they may *find* there depends
on what the system is established to support. Of course, many do
support our operating system, but I've known many RCP/Ms used to
support private businesses, writers' groups, clubs. That was why
I mentioned Z-Nodes.

Support for CP/M does not have to come from a CP/M based machine.
There are people running Z-Nodes (supporting CP/M and ZCPR) from
other platforms. So Z-Nodes are not, by their very nature, RCP/Ms.

This brings us full circle. (1) A Z-Node is a bbs (usually but not
always an RCP/M) to support CP/M and ZCPR. (2) Many RCP/Ms support
CP/M and ZCPR but few outside the United States have been listed,
at least so far as the rest of us would know. Ian Cottrell publishes
a list of RCPMs and Jay Sage releases the list of Z-Nodes. I have
published the Z-Node list in the last two issues of TCJ. The RCP/M
listing is too large to print.

Sysops of either should get their systems listed so that support
for users can be available in their own countries. Jay reads this
news group. His Internet address is SAGE@LL.MIT.EDU. So far as I
know, Ian is not on the net. I can forward mail to him for you. We
need your help in compiling the information! Thanks.

   Yes, it is possible.
 
   on the command line for the compiler add a /O (letter 'O' not a zero)
to tell the compiler to stick RQUEST OBSLIB.REL into the object file,
instead of RQUEST BASLIB.REL.
 
   the linker will instead pull routines out of the OBSLIB.REL library.
These routines do not require the presence of BRUN.COM, and oftentimes will
allow larger programs to execute in less memory.
 
   To do this, you need to have a copy of OBSLIB.REL around somewhere.  It
is a part of the distribution package.
 
   But the downside of this is that there are some commands that are 
implemented in BASLIB.REL that are not implemented in OBSLIB.REL.  Depending
on whether your existing programs use these commands, you might have some
problems getting them to compile to standalone executables.  

   For instance, COMMON is not supported, and CHAIN is semantically equivalent
to a RUN statement.
 
   RUN <linenumber> is not supported.  RUN can only call another *.COM
file.

   The CLEAR command is not supported in any way.

   For large applications, these may cause additional problems.  Implementing
a system of programs that call one another is not easy, since sharing
information is restricted.  What you may end up doing is passing parameters
from one module to another by writing them into a file, and having the target
module check for the presence of that file

   Programs that use CLEAR to allow arrays to be resized will also have
problems.  Arrays cannot be dynamically allocated, as they could with the
interpreter, and array definitions must be integer constants.  Once you
define an array for a program, you cannot delete it or change it.
 
   Hope that helps you...

First, I wanna thank all who have replied to my plea for help. (I don't
know how I get myself into these things!). Second, the consensus seems to
be that I have two birds here; the monitor seems to be in actuality  
something else, a Televideo model 800. The cpu seems to be a Televideo
Model 806. At least that's what those with much more brains than I say
it is. I guess the big problem is that the monitor is looking for a     
"server" to boot up from, and the cpu is trying to boot up period. Somehow
I gotta get the two connected together properly. While the monitor part
has an RS422 connector, the other end of the cable that's connected to it
is connected to the "User 1" port on the cpu. Now, the cpu has a "terminal"
port, but no cable connected to it, and none came with it. It looks to be a
25-pin RS232 connector. Say, do you suppose that I could hook up a dumb
televideo 950 or 925 terminal to that, and t'd fire up? Just a thought....
in the meantine, I guess the big question is, can this monitor and this
cpu be made to work together? (I haven't got a Televideo dumb terminal
anyway!) To those of you who responded to me via here, I'll keep ya'all
posted as to any developments in this saga, please keep feeding me info!
For those of you who sent me email on this, check your mailboxes!

Earl, I have a copy of the MMMOST disk that I am sending to you - I think I
still have your address.  I have Sysgen'd it with the CPM58.COM file that is

the 802H (hard-drive), and I'm not sure it will work.  I'll send it along
also, though, just in case.

Most of the files on the MMMOST disk will probably not be of value, but they
are there anyway for your own amazement, if nothing else.  Keep us posted on

Subject: Qterm/vt100   
Message-ID: <9460729@ub.cc.umich.edu>

I am using the cpm QTERM comm program with its vt100 emulator to talk to
our mainframe (UB-MTS) full-screen message system.
I am running QTERM on a Kaypro-II, a slow machine.
The problem I am having is that even at 1200 baud  sometimes the vt100 codes
coming in from MTS go by too fast for the Kaypro to keep up, and the screen
gets scrambled.  I checked this out at 300 baud, and at that speed it works
first time, every time, but that is impractical.
 
What I need is either a way to halt input from MTS while the Kaypro processes
the cursor and screen control codes, or a way to patch QTERM with what I believe
is called an "interrupt driver".  I'm just parroting the term, I don't know
what it means.  
 
I have a fast terminal emulator (fastterm.com) that works at high speeds without
dropping characters, apparently because it is interrupt driven.
 
Suggestions are solicited.  Please keep in mind that I relatively ignorant of
these matters, and have almost no experience in working with assembler.  If   
patching is an option you'll have to tell me how, as well as what to patch.
 
Thanks.

You absolultely can NOT do multi-processing with a regular
SoftCard (maybe, and I mean ---MAYBE---, with a SoftCard //e).
It is physically impossible and it isn't feasible if you're
talking about running the two processors running asynchronously
(i.e. running the two processors independently of each other).
When the SoftCard is active, it effectively completely takes over
your whole computer.  It puts the 6502 to sleep and becomes the
main processor for a time.

                  =========================================

  This list is an attempt at answering most of the `Can anyone tell me what
the best CP/M compiler for language "foo" is?' questions. Please do not
expect this list to be definitive. I am very much dependent on the information
sent to me, and if nobody mentioned a certain compiler, chances are you won't
find it here. If you know of a compiler that should be in the list, send me
a description.

  Compiler categories:
    I've split up the list into two parts, based on how much info I have on
the compiler concerned. The first list is a list of compilers with some kind
of description, the second list contains compiler only known to me by name.
Please note that 1 (one) line of descriptive comment is enough to make it a
category 1 compiler. ;-)

  Compiler availability:
    Many compilers are still sold, others can only be obtained as an illegal
copy. Also some compilers are public domain, but alas that group is rather
small. I think that, even though many companies are no longer actively
engaged in maintaining their CP/M packages, they will _not_ look kindly on
publicly announced copying. Since I received _no_ communications from
persons working for companies like Borland, Microsoft, and Digital Research,
I wonder if any of them monitor this list. Perhaps we as collective CP/M
users can draw some goodwill, and persuade them to remove some of the copying
restrictions on e.g. binaries.
  I mention the copyright holder when known. "?? PD ??" means that I don't
know, but that they are for sale at such a low rate that I suspect them to
be at least shareware.
  Many Bulletin Boards have interesting software, and Ed Grey not only
runs a BBS, but also sells MIX C and Turbo PASCAL v3. RS components in
England also sells originals materials. I mention these two as example,
undoubtebly there are others with remnants of a large stock. JRT PASCAL,
Prolog-80, Micro-COBOL, Forth-83, Small-C and others are appearently
PD, and can be had from BBSes. PCW world seems to have MBASIC on one of
their disks, but I'm doubtful about their right to do this.

  References:
    I include the names of all those that sent me information on the
compilers, since they are likely to know more if you have questions about
a specific product.

  The rumors:
    Hah! many! I'm forced to reject rumors that Microsoft is no longer
interested: RS components still sells compilers for CP/M+ - including
Macro-80! - for three figure amounts.

   Kinda common on 2Mhz z80 machines...

   well, most mainframes don't have the response time needed to tell them
to stop sending in time.  the interrupt driven approach is the best
alternative, but bear in mind it might not solve the problem.

   most cp/m com programs use an "overlay" to allow the same executable code
to work on different serial port hardware.  your best bet would be to
rewrite the overlay so it does interrupt driven input/output.  the hardware
is definately able to support it.
 
   but the reason why i said this might not work is because interrupt driven
input will allow the terminal/computer to store characters it otherwise would
miss in a circular buffer in RAM.  If the serial port baud rate is too fast
for the processor to handle, then interrupt driven input won't do a scrap of
good.  it will, however, allow your machine to handle the data as fast as
it can when the baud rate is faster than the processor can handle, for short
periods of time.  (like, the the processor is handling those vt100 codes.)
you may find that you'll have to get your mainframe to add nulls to the end
of every line, to give the kaypro time to catch up.
 
   handling interrupt requests on a z80 system (using z80sio chips) is
very straightforward and reading the data sheets will give you all the 
information you need.  (whether it is comprehendable or not is left as
an excercise for the student...  ;)  there are many books on the subject,
if you can still find them.
 
   someone may have already gone ahead and written an interrupt driven 
overlay for QTERM for the kaypro II, so if you can find someone who has one
you may have the easy way out there.
 
   but if you can't find one, i'll help you with it.  I have a kaypro II 83,
which is probably the same thing you have, and could help debug the code.
all you need as a starting point is a virgin copy of the QTERM distribution,
which should have the overlay information in it.
