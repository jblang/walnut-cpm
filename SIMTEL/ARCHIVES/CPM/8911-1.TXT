There's a file on both simtel20 and genie called zmp15kp.lbr which is
ZMP already configured for the Kaypro.  On simtel20 it's in the
directory pd2:<cpm.zmodem>.  I haven't used it extensively
yet but it does work on the kaypro 2X.

Subject: on the other side of the floppy ...

A friend of mine wants to know how to do a CP/M bios (BDOS) call to
read/write side 1 of the floppy disk (vs side 0).

He knows where the disk controller is and he can do whatever he wants to
either sides of the floppy by writing to it directly and bypassing BDOS.
What he wants to know is how to do it via a BDOS call; or how to set it up
such that the BDOS call will read side 1 of the disk.

I have a CP/M Plus card for my Apple //e made by ALS (who no longer exists)
and it came with plenty of documentation, all by Digital Research.  However,
they were no help what-so-ever when it comes to accessing side 1 of the
floppy.  May be because my computer does not understand side 1 since it
doesn't have double sided disk drives!!  

Anyways.  If anyone out there knows how to setup BDOS to access side 1 please
email my friend at:

I've used probably most of the C compilers out (at least at one rev each :-),
and my preferred one is Aztec C.  Ecosoft C isn't bad, but the compiler has
an irritating habit of crashing on syntax errors!  I used BDS C 1.5 a fair
amount, it worked well but wasn't very "standard" - I'm told this is fixed
with their new v1.6. If so, it might be your best bet...

Subject: Z-sys help w/ Xerox 820-II

Help!  S-O-S!  Help!
  
I am in acute need of a solution to a problem that has taken my BBS,
The Shire Scribe BBS, off line.
  
I have operated happily for the past two years using MICROcode QP/M
v2.7 as an OS for my Xerox 820-II. It has search path, and time/date
stamping, and some other neat features that made is suited for my use.
   
Saddly, I encountered an avalanche of requests from my user base, all
non-programmers I might add, to expand to allow the use of FIDO-mail
on my CP/M machine. I found the software to do this, and when run as
a manually operated system, it works fine.
BUT, QP/M does not recognize, nor act upon $$$.SUB files, and as a
result, the YBBAT utilities which automate the netmail process, have
brought the system down consistantly. No-one is happy about that!
  
In discussions with others, it was suggested that I set up a ZCMD28 or 
29 CPR, and that it would solve my problems. It might have, if I could
get it to work on my system.
  
I can't seem to correctly install a ZCMD system on my XEROX 820-II. I
have been told that the machine is different than most, and has a 
large number of strangly unique problems. I don't know... I'm almost
ready to surrender.
  
What I need, is someone who has either set up a Z-system on a XEROX 820-II,
who can guide me through the creation. * OR * someone who would send me
a Z-Systemed Xerox disk.
 
I don't know what else to do.
Any help would be greatly appreciated, and will allow the BBS to again
answer the phone.
 
Thanks

True they are different cpu's, BUT the Z280 IS a superset of the

Find an Epson repair center and tell them you want to order a battery
for a PX-8.  The part number on the one I have in front of me is RB 201.
It costs about $95.

>Are they one of those flat proprietary things or

It looks like four nicads wired together, though I haven't broken mine
open to see.  The spec is: 4.8V/1100mAh.

Subject: CP/M-86 on Toshiba laptops

 I have, after a great deal of difficulty, been able to install a CP/M-86 partition on the hard disk of a Toshiba 286 laptop, but I still cannot figure out any way to make a bootable 3.5" floppy.
 
  I put the CP/M partition on the hard disk by attaching the 5.25" drive of an external AT to the Toshiba through an adapter.  After installing the CP/M on the Toshiba, I had no difficulty booting it from the hard disk, but even when I format the 3.5" floppy on the Toshiba, and copy the software from the Toshiba's hard disk to the floppy, I cannot make it boot. If this isn't frustrating enough, the Toshiba won't read 3.5" floppies that are formated on the AT 286. BTW, both the Toshiba and the AT have 2 Meg



 3.5" drives, and the AT has a 1.2 Meg 5.25" drive.
 
 Has anyone been able to make bootable 3.5" floppies?
 
 On the positive side, the Toshiba runs applications written for CP/M-86 faster and with less hassles than the AT, and of course, it is certainly more portable!
 
 What applications, you might ask, are available for CP/M-86?  Well, it seems that a number of industrial programs from Germany, especially those for Siemens programmable logic controllers, are only available in CP/M-86 versions.

Got a quick question for all you cpm gurus.  I was given ( or

with a decision to sell it.  I have a chance to get a Kaypro at
a very very low cost and after some thought, It's the best

Now the question...
How much should I ask for an Osborne 1 , with software.  I would
like to get about 100.00.  Does that sound like too much?

Any suggestions will be appreciated.

 The external monitor adapter, if I remember correctly, is more than just connectors and cables.  Ok, I just opened up my adapter. It contains an MC14528 integrated circuit, 5 resisters, 2 diodes, 3 capacitors, and 2 transisters. Its a little too complicated for most people to duplicate.  I suggest you try to buy one. Maybe you can even talk me into selling mine.
 
 Wait, a minute. The original Osborne external video monitor did not require the adapter. It just plugged into the port marked "DO NOT REMOVE THIS CONNECTOR WITH POWER ON".  The low cost, standard composite video monitors do require an adapter to plug into that port, such as the DAPTRON VIDEO ADAPTER that I have. These adapters were not made by Osborne.
 
 KL>   Next, one of them has an internal modem; what sort of commands does

 The internal modem is a primative, pulse dial, 300-baud unit. I have one good one and a dead one.  I'd be glad to make you a copy of some software that can address that modem, but be aware that the modem is really no winner.

   Dealing with hardware details does not fall within the province of
the BDOS.  A clue to this is the fact that *ALL* CP/M-2.2 computers use
the very same BDOS code, despite many hardware differences (some use
hard disks, RAM disks, or floppies; the floppies are single-sided or
double-sided, 48-tpi or 96-tpi, 8" or 5", etc.).  The BDOS deals with
disks at the file level, not at the physical sector and side level.

   You should not expect Digital Research to help with this, as it has
nothing to do with CP/M.  All the hardware-specific information is in
the BIOS, which is supplied by the computer designer and not by DRI.

   Even the BIOS, by the way, does not deal with the hardware at the
'side' level.  Externally, it is required to select a specified track
and sector number only.  It is a BIOS internal function to decide on which
side a sector of a given number is located.  So, I think your friend
cannot use the operating system to select a specified side of the
diskette; he will have to, as he is now, use code that directly accesses
the disk controller.

  I have never heard of anything like this... a BIOS which understands

logical track goes on one side, one on the other. I *did* have a BIOS
which treated the two sides as separate drives (C: and D:) but that was
a BIOS I wrote myself from scratch and which had a special purpose.

     There are some CP/M BIOSes that treat the second side of the disk as
an extension of the first... i.e. as a track with twice the # of sectors.

     CCS BIOS for their 2422 S-100 disk controlr is like this.

Subject: S-100 help

I recently aquired an IMS S-100 machine, and need a bit of help with it. The 
model (as far as I can tell), is 8000SX. I need help booting it up.

What came with the machine is: 
 
Z-80 master/slave
Two Z-80 user processors
Adaptec hard drive controller
Floppy drive controller (IMS is stamped on the board)
What looks like a paralell interface adapter
Quantum 2040 hard drive
Two IMS Ultima II terminals
No floppy came with the system, but I purchased a Tandon 8" DSDD drive (no
idea what the model is)
 
When I power it up, not a thing happens. The terminal just sits there, 
cursor happily blinking. I throw the reset switch, and still no dice.
I called Cubix (the company that brought out L/F Tech, who in turn
brought out IMS), and got little help. They stated that they still 
support these machines, but I havent gotten a bit of support from them.
I asked if they could send me a boot floppy, and an installation guide,
about a month ago, and havent heard from them since.

I need someone to tell me how to install this thing (which boards are needed
and how to wire them together. Seems to be about 5 headers on each processor
board, and Ive no idea what to plug where.)
 
If someone could lend a hand, Id greatfully appreciate it. Please call me
at (201)989-8161 if you can give me some kind of information. At this 
point, any info is good, as I have none. Many thanx for listening.

Subject: Subsrciption Rates for The Computer Journal

[This is another reposting of this message.]

Although I posted a similar message not very long ago, I am still
getting questions about the subscription rates for The Computer
Journal (TCJ).  Also, I have now talked to Art Carlson, the publisher,
and have learned that my overseas rates were not entirely correct.

                                1 YEAR          2 YEARS
                                ------          -------

        United States             $16             $28

        Canada                    $22             $42

        Surface Foreign           $24

        Air to Europe             $32

        Air to Elsewhere          $38

I did not ask Art Carlson about two-year rates outside the US and
Canada.  The figures might be a bit daunting anyway!  I should add
that a one-year subscription means six issues.  Subscriptions can be
ordered by writing or calling:

        The Computer Journal

Subject: Z280 Instruction Set

I think there is a little misunderstanding :
Fifi is talking about Z280 and Z800 (which was never produced).
The Z8000 is really another CPU (real 16-Bit). The Z280 Instruction
Set (identical to that of Z800 as released in 1983) is really
a superset of the Z80 instruction set.
Has everybody understood now?

Subject: S-100 revisited

In the never ending saga of bringing up an old S-100 machine, I recived 
some usefull information today.

Called Cubix again and got a little more help this time. I learned how to
set the address jumpers for each user processor and wiring for the terminal
Also the fellow told me how to get to the ROM monitor.

I set everything as told, and finally got to the monitor. A little bit
more useful than a dead, blank screen. I still cant get an operation
system to load. I learned (thru three people: Cubix, Helena Valley in     
Montana, and horne@cs.utexas.edu) that this is a TurboDOS system.

Next step, to bring up an operating system. Still need help with that.
I can only do so much with the ROM monitor.

 Mack, although I had a neighbor give me an 01 with software and modem for free because he thought it didn't work (just cleaned the disk drive and it flew), I think that an 01 should be worth at least $100.  Even though it is an old computer, it does do word processing, is luggable, and can communicate over a modem.

Subject: Ever hear of Molecular Computer?

I've stumbled into posession of an interesting 16 user CP/M machine
called a SuperMicro 32X from Molecular Computer, Inc.  Each user gets
their own Z-80 processor and they all sit on an 8 bit CSMA/CD bus with
one processor that takes care of a shared hard disk, floppy, and tape drive.

Unfortunately, the company went bankrupt several years ago and there was
no technical documentation supplied with the system.  I hesitate to put
any amount of work into it fearing that it will break and be unfixable.

Anyone know who might have docs to this thing?  (Designers?  Field service?)

It's too bad this thing is such a black box; it's a well designed
system.  But now it might as well be scrapped for parts.

Interesting.  It sounds almost identical to an MS-DOS machine I put
together a few years ago; one CPU per person, up to 32 CPUs total.
And I thought it was a novel idea.... :-)

A program that works on a Kaypro, Bigboard or Xerox 820-I or Xerox 820-II

1. Howard, did You notice a key on Your keyboard marked with something
   like "Carriage return", "Return" or the like?

2. An ftp site is a host on the usenet which runs an ftp deamon and
   allows other hosts (and especially users on those hosts) to access
   files on the local system.
   (Be aware that You'll need an account on such a host or the host has
   to provide an "anonymous" login to access specific files)

3. SIMTEL-20 has a host of cp/m software

Hi.  I have a NEC PC-8500 computer, and I am looking for any sort of
information on its internals that you might have.  The only information
I was able to get from NEC was the service manual for the computer itself;
unfortunately, there was no information on peripherals or anything even
closely related to programming.  So, I am searching for any sort of
documentation other than the NEC service manual that is out there.

My system consists of the basic PC-8500, plus a PC-8508 128k RAM module
(with a couple of ROM sockets I would like to fill), a PC-8431 monitor/disk
interface, and a PC-8441 disk drive.  If you have any information at all
about any of this stuff, please send me some mail.  I am particularly
interested in:
     1.  information on the extended BIOS routines.  I have had some
	 success at disassembling the BIOS but there are about 100 routines
	 and I have so far only figured out what about 1/3 to 1/2 of them
	 do.
     2.  I/O port assignments.  So far I know the ones for the disk drive
	 and video interface (from the documentation) and partial information
	 on the parallel port and memory mapping register, but there is much
	 more that I haven't been able to figure out from reading the ROM.
	 The schematic is no help either since all of the chip selecting and
	 such is done by a couple of custom PALs.
     3.  how to set up a ROM so it will show up in the application menu
     4.  pinouts for the disk drive, both the internal connectors (so I can
	 add another drive) and the interface connector (so I can turn my
	 Amiga into a disk server... the manual describes the protocol in
	 detail but they forgot to give the pinouts of the cable)
     5.  Leads on where I can find any application ROMs that might have ever
	 been produced for this thing.

For those who might be unfamiliar with this machine, it is a nice little
laptop with a good keyboard, flip-up 80x25 LCD, Z-80 compatible CPU, 64k RAM,
300 bps modem, and applications in ROM (CP/M 2.2 with a menu driven CCP,
WordStar, SuperCalc, telecommunications, and simple database)... sort of like
a Tandy 100 on steroids.

As I said, *any* information you can send me will be appreciated.  Likewise,
if you are interested in the (quite incomplete) information I have dug up
in disassembling the 8500's BIOS, let me know.  Thanks...

G'day, eh?

Subject: on the other side of the floppy ...

Hello.

"snoopy" (Mathias Niemz) writes about problems with adapting his "multi-format 
bios" to the Alphatronic disk format.
But, the way of accessing the second side of the floppy is quite standard.
For remembrance: there are two ways of second-side access:
1. 'Sector Overflow'. The most usual method. The sectors of side 2 are
   processed after that of side 1 on the same track. So every track appears
   to have twice as much sectors for the BDOS.
2. 'Track Overflow'. Not that usual, but still standard and ok. The sectors
   of side 2 are processed after side 1 is finished, i.e. after maximum
   track on side 1 comes track 0 on side 2.
Every "multi-format bios" that wears this name for right, should be able
to process both ways of double-side access. So, I guess that Mathias doesn't
really have such a bios.
Just for the record: There is also a third way of accessing side 2.
One can mix the two methods mentioned above and will get the following:
The real order of sector processing is like 'sector overflow', but the
tracks are numbered equal on side 1 and odd on side 2. So, the BDOS thinks
of twice as much tracks (as with track overflow), but in fact there are
twice as much sectors. If you then choose an odd number of offset tracks,
the most real multi-format systems get in trouble (mine too), as they can't
divide the physical tracks into two logical tracks.

Subject: Well, I finally got CPM,

Hello, 
I did finally get a copy of CPM for my S-100 machine. I was always begging for
a copy of someone's boot floppy but the idea of working the thing blindly into
my system was a little scary. Last week , at a swap meet, I found a copy of CPM
with all the docs, fresh from the factory in shrink wrap. It cost a whole $2.50!

Now I have also aquired a hard disk controller for cheap but I'm caught again in
the 'no documentation' trap. The card is S-100,  
		-->  HDCA-4A  WINCHESTER CONTROLLER by George Morrow.

I'd like to put this card into action, so I'm asking for any help to get infor-
mation. I have called several old numbers for Morrow Computers but never reached
anyone connected with the company.

Can someone please give me a current number for Morrow or send me info on the 
board. I need docs and some idea about how to incorporate drivers into my BIOS.

I am thanking in advance for all your help........

  Well, there's tiny-C, which is PD, and a version from _Code Works_
which might be. Neither have f.p., and even after a beating on the code
generator it was not more than adequate. 

  Some of our summer students hacked the CW version to generate 8051
code. Now's there's a hack for you! The original PC, powered by

  About Thinkertoys, as far as I know "they be gone." I sold one of
these beasts and will be seing the current owner tomorrow night and try
to ask if he has the manual. I recall that they were a low capacity 14

Applicard is from PCPI and was sold as the StarCard with wordstar.
Also, Franklin sold it as their CPM card.

[First, please let me apologize for posting to the net, but I haven't been
able to contact David Goodenough via mail, nor at any of the 4 bbs numbers
he lists.]

Has anyone managed to get UUCP201 working yet?
I seem to have gotten QTERM (v4.1d) working reasonably well.
However, UUCP201 is a different story. 

I've gotten to where I've editted TCAP.Z and CONFIG.Z to reflect my site and
my oddball hardware. (I had to write an interrupt routine to keep from
dropping characters, but that's another story...)

At this point, the documentation says to type
SUBMIT B:ALL
at the A prompt. Well, I've done that, and made sure it's the SUBMIT.COM that
came out of the UUCP201.LBR, and all I get is what seems to be the DRI SUBMIT
complaining that there's no input file! What gives?

I'd appreciate any information.

Thanks,
Andy

I have the exact same problem on my system, only I forgot to modify
my tcap.z file (which shouldn't be too hard to do, since I already
have QTERM working on my system).  Evidently, the file ALL.SUB file
is missing from the library.  I too need it.

Subject: ZSID question

How often does this happen to YOU?  I have inherited some old Z80 code and
don't have any manuals.  In fact, I hardly have a development system!  
Anyway, included is a batch file to link everything.  After linking is 
complete, it calls ZSID with the following commands:

       ZSID PROG.COM
       A80 
       LD HL,6100
       LD DE,6200
       LD BC,6001
       LDDR

       .

       G80
       IPROG.COM
       R
       GO
       SAVE 32 CPROG.COM
 
I can figure what the code is doing.  What are the ZSID commands?  

Would it have anything to do with the fact that the target machine for this
program is NOT a 100% CP/M box?

Many, many thanks in advance!

I screwed up. Would you believe 100H-2100H?

Of course, if the machine isn't standard CP/M, then the starting point
of SAVE may very well be different.

Could very well be: looks like the net effect of this is to create a
file with 6100H-61FFH as a copy of 6200H-62FFH; I'd bet the machine's
memory map is weird.

Subject: Baud rates on a C128 in CP/M mode

I have a real need to alter the baud rate on a C128 (running in CP/M mode)
to either 75 or 50 BPS. I can get it down to 300 easily, but was wondering
how to get it to go slower. I know that (for now) 2400 is out due to the
rather ghastly coding of the 232 driver, but I'd imagine slower should be
trivial.

Followups are directed to comp.sys.cbm for any CP/M'ers that wish to follow,
or just mail me, and if enough people ask, I'll summarize.

			Thanks in advance,

I have two HP 120 computers which I use as hp2621 terminals
to Unix boxes. I also have a HP 2683 computer which I also use
as a terminal.

I need a manual for the HP 2683 computer (the local HP office says
the machine is obsolete, not supported, and no docs or parts
are available.)

I'm also looking for the HPIB cable, diskdrive, and CPM o/s

There is!
You can send mail to either of
   LISTSERV@VM.ECS.RPI.EDU
   LISTSERV@VM1.NODAK.EDU

The mail body should be something like (start in leftmost column):
/PDDIR
	- returns: CPM SIGM PC-BLUE MSDOS MISC
/PDDIR PD:<directory>
/PDDIR PD:<directory.subdirectory>filename.ext age
	- directory is one of CPM SIGM PC-BLUE MSDOS MISC
	- age = 0..9999, specifies age of files for directory listing
	  default is 30 days
	- wildcards are allowed e.g.
		/PDDIR PD:<CPM.*>*.* 9999
	 will work, but will probably cause a lot of nuisance
/PDGET format PD:<CPM.subdirectory>filename.ext (encoding
	- use format=MAIL, encoding=UUE (note the left brace!!)
	- no wildcards allowed here

The amount sent at each request is limited in number of files and number
of bytes sent.

Subject: TeleVideo TS804

Does anyone else out there have a TeleVideo TS804?  I  bought one used for
$450.  It came with a 10 meg harddisk, Multi-user CP/M, and CP/M+ (CP/M 3.0).
I use CP/M+ pretty much exclusively.  Anyway, it had been working pretty
flawlessly, but now when I power it up, shortly after I get the
"Running diagnostics..." msg., it says something like: WDC REG ERROR, then
refuses to boot off the hard disk.  I think the WDC means "Winchester Drive
Controller", but have no idea what "REG" means.  Register, perhaps?  Anyway,
I can get it to boot off the floppy, and then read/write from the HD, but
the HD makes strange noises it didn't used to make.  Kind of a buzzing sound
when it accesses the HD.  I realize this is an old computer, and I could
proabably buy an IBM compatible that would run circles around this thing
for the cost to fix it, but if anyone could offer me any assistance, I would
be very grateful.

KERMIT has a VT52 emulator and is written in ASM. I know how to get it

It's also available via anonymous FTP, but I don't know how to get there.

For what it's worth, the June 1984 issue of Microsystems starts a two-part
article on X.25, with code written in Pascal. Simply dive into your pile
of back issues (doesn't every die-hard CP/Mer have a pile of back issues
of magazines?) and enjoy.

The code in these articles is written in Pascal-MT/86, but should be
reasonably close to almost portable (I don't have Part II, which has
the code, immediately handy).

Hope this helps.

I can't believe Ian and I are the only ones trying to get this to work?!

Also there is mention of a QTERM 4.2 (with a larger patch area) -
does anyone have it? One of my oddball machines required that I write
a received character interrupt routine, and unfortunately it's bigger
that the 4.1d patch area.

Hello.

As I did before, here I tell it once again:

I WILL NEVER PUT "ARC V2.0" IN ANY NET VIA E-MAIL.

It's just too expensive because of it's large size. All europeans who are
interested in it are allowed to send me a 5" disk with the exact description
of the used format (best, a well-known one, i.e. Osborne-DD) with a "SASE".
Please: Don't use 'strange formats' (I explained sometime ago) !

For the ones in USA: Please contact Jay Sage! He will get a copy of the
program as soon as it's fully (?) tested.

So: please don't send me messages like 'please mail the program' any more, ok?

Subject: Need Amstrad CP/M conversion

Greetings, Net-Land. 

I have received two compact floppy discs from a researcher here who
wants the files off of those discs and converted into a more usable
format (ie, MS-DOS).  As near as we can determine, the discs, which
measure 3.2" x 3.8" x 0.2", are for an Amstrad CP/M machine with a
single-sided drive, which was what they were using in the Sudan,
apparantly.  At any rate, does anybody stateside have any ideas as
to where I might go to get these things converted?

					Thanks!

Subject: ZSID question

I don't have a copy of ZSID, so you may have to take the following analysis
with a grain of salt.  However, it's not too different in syntax from
some other CP/M debuggers I've used...  With the previous warning in mind,
here is my analysis of your batch file:


       ZSID PROG.COM      - invokes ZSID (Symbolic Debugger for Z80 ) and
                            loads "PROG.COM" to transient Program Area
                            (typically 0100H on conventional CP/M systems)
       A80                - assemble the following code beginning at address
                            0080H

       LD HL,6100        \
       LD DE,6200         \  Relocates a large block of memory (I would
       LD BC,6001         /  suspect the BIOS... ???)
       LDDR              /   (ie, shift 6001H bytes down by 0100H (assuming
       NOP                   the default assembler base is hexadecimal!)
       NOP
       .                  - end of code...
       P8B                - got me, but I think this sets a breakpoint in ZSID
                            at location 008BH, returning control to ZSID when
                            address 008BH is encountered.  It would appear to
                            prevent the need for a "RET" instruction in the
                            assembly code segment...
       G80                - execute code stating @ 0080H
                            ( effectively a jump, which will relocate memory,
                            then return control to ZSID... )
       IPROG.COM          - set up File Control Block for filename "PROG.COM"
       R                  - read in file set up with previous "I" command

       GO                 - execute program in TPA without reloading it
                            (usually, this is effectively a JMP to 0100H )
                          - GO is a CCP command, meaning that you
                            have exitted ZSID somehow between the "R"
                            command and the "GO" command, although I don't
                            see how (perhaps an embedded ^C in the batch
                            file ???)

       SAVE 32 CPROG.COM  - save 32 pages starting @ 0100H to the
                            file "CPROG.COM" (one page being 256 bytes)
                          - "SAVE" is also a CCP command, which makes
                            me sure you have left ZSID by this point...

The code is quite likely a quick and dirty way to read in a program,
offset said program (somehow) and then write it out again.  However,
it sure plays hell on absolute addressing schemes...  But, I can't offer
any more information than this.  Perhaps someone else on the net?

Hi,

I have recently built an interface to connect an Atari Mouse to my
SB180FX (Steve Ciarcia's Z-System).
I would like to publish the design in Steve's "Circuit Cellar Ink", but
this would only make sense if the mouse itself was separately available
in the US (I had difficulties buying one in Germany, I got mine from the
Netherlands).

So: can one buy an Atari Mouse separately from the Machine itself?

Message-ID: <4408.2573b882@uwovax.uwo.ca>

 I have an OSBORNE 001 with the external video option and monitor.  The
external video worked for a while. However, it has not worked since I ran
the CP/M SETUP program (to change a printer device). This may have been
coincidental with unplugging the external video connector while the Osborne
was powered on.

 Does anyone know if there is a common problem that might occur with the
Osborne video output? How can it be fixed? Are any circuit diagrams available?
I'm confident that the CPU and other circuitry are okay.  The problem seems
to be in the video output.

BTW, I don't have the plug marked "Warning do not remove with power on" so
I can't try the internal monitor to see if that works.

Any help would be appreciated.

Thanks,

Hello.

Is it true? Does really NOONE of you know the LDDR command of Z80?
It's quite unbelievable for me, 
so here is a lesson in Z80 Assembler Programming:

The LDDR command
- takes the byte from address (HL)
- puts it to the address (DE)
- decrements BC, DE and HL
- until BC is zero.

Got it?
So the tiny program of "ashepps" will take all memory from 0100h (including)
to 6100h (including, too) and move it up to 0200h to 6200h. Nothing else,
and especially no down-move!
The LDDR command is used instead of the LDIR command cause the segment is
overlapping in the high-part.

The 'G0' command is indeed the system reboot command (just as ^C, but better
for batch file use). SAVE 32 will also save the memory from 0100h to 20FFh,
as mentioned by jay maynard.

The function of that batchfile depends on the original length of PROG.COM:
If it's more than 8k, the generated file will be unchanged.
Else, the file will lengthened up to 8k, and the added part will be a copy
of the original (moved up by 100h), plus eventually some old stuff that was
in memory that time.

I can't imagine what kind of purpose that batchfile could have.
But surely it has nothing to do with the BIOS, as someone guessed before.

Tilmann.

Actually, this starts execution at location 0. I.e., it does a warm boot.

Hello there,

a friend is working with COBOL on MSDOS-machines. He is now trying to
port his programs to CP/M. But the Microsoft-COBOL he owns seems not to
compile his programs. Now he is looking for other compilers on CP/M.
I forgot the name of his MSDOS compiler, but the company earlier sold a
version for CP/M which is no more available.
Are there any other COBOL compilers for CP/M than Microsoft?

Another question. I recently got ZEX50 from SIMTEL20 and tried it under
ZCPR33, but the only thing that happened was a message like 'the Z-system
 lacks some features required' or so. In the latest version of Z3LIB
I found the description of the new enhanced environment descriptor.
After working on  my SYS.ENV, the ZEX error message changed to
'incompatible RSX changed address at (0001)'.
As I understand, ZEX 5.0 should run under ZCPR33. Obviously,
I missed something.
Any hints would be helpful.

Thanks, Roger.
