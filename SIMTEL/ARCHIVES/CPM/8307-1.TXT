Subject:  ZCPR2 for Osborne-1

        I am very pleased  to  announce  that  AR86:CPM  contains
Z2OZ.LQR,  a  library  file  containing the source for a FULL (or
nearly so) implementation of ZCPR2 which  runs  on  an  Osborne-1
with  Version 1.4 ROM.  The source to a special version of ZCPR2,
its header, a patch to the  BIOS,  and  a  text  file  describing
installation  procedures  are  contained  in this LBR file.  CRCs
match.

        This implementation of ZCPR2 for the  Osborne-1  includes
external  paths,  multiple  command  lines,  both  SUBMIT and ZEX
capability,  autostart  via  STARTUP,  and  other  useful  ZCPR2-
specific  features.   It  really  makes the Osborne-1 look like a
different machine!  Notably lacking from this (because  I  didn't
feel  it made sense to include it) is the named directory feature
of ZCPR2.

        Enjoy!

I wasn't aware that there was a rule saying we had to stick to the
original topic in our discussions.

Anyway, mutability of a system to meet the needs or desires of
a particular user for a particular application is another good
attribute to look for.  Items such as being able to define your
own commands, invoke menus as desired (without excessive programming
effort), change working environs (subdirectories, I/O system, etc),
and tailoring user interfaces are good things to consider as well
as those I mentioned in the last message.

     NAME
	  inews	- submit news articles

     SYNOPSIS
	  inews	-t _t_i_t_l_e [ -n _n_e_w_s_g_r_o_u_p_s ] [ -e	_e_x_p_i_r_a_t_i_o_n _d_a_t_e	]

	  inews	-p  [ _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e ]

	  inews	-C _n_e_w_s_g_r_o_u_p

     DESCRIPTION
	  _I_n_e_w_s	submits	news articles to  the  USENET  news  network.	The
	  first	 form  is  for	submitting user	articles.  The body will be
	  read from the	standard input.	 A _t_i_t_l_e must be specified as there
	  is no	default.  Each article belongs to a list of newsgroups.	 If
	  the -n flag is omitted, the list will	default	to  something  line
	  _g_e_n_e_r_a_l.   (On  ours,	 it  is	 _g_e_n_e_r_a_l.) If you wish to submit an
	  article in multiple newsgroups, the _n_e_w_s_g_r_o_u_p_s must be  separated
	  by  commas  and/or spaces.  If not specified,	the expiration date
	  will be set to the local default.   The  -f  flag  specifies	the
	  article's  sender.  Without this flag, the sender defaults to	the
	  user's name.

	  The second  form  is	used  for  receiving  articles	from  other
	  machines.   If  _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e  is given, the article will be read from
	  the specified	file; Otherwise	the article will be read  from	the
	  standard  input.   An	 expiration  date need not be present and a
	  receival date, if present, will be ignored.

	  After	local installation, inews will transmit	the article to	all
	  systems that subscribe to the	newsgroups that	the article belongs
	  to.

	  The third form is for	creating new newsgroups.  On some  systems,
	  this	may  be	limited	to specific users such as the super-user or
	  news administrator.  (This happens on	ours.)

	  If the file /usr/lib/news/recording is present, it is	taken as  a
	  list of "recordings" to be shown to users posting news.  (This is
	  by analogy to	the recording you hear when you	dial information in
	  some	parts of the country, asking you if you	really wanted to do
	  this.) The file contains lines of the	form:
	       newsgroups <tab>	filename
	  for example:
	       net.all	 /usr/lib/news/net.recording
	       fa.all	 /usr/lib/news/fa.recording
	  Any user posting an article to a newsgroup matching  the  pattern
	  on  the left will be shown the contents of the file on the right.
	  The user is then told	to hit DEL to abort or RETURN  to  proceed.
	  The  intent of this feature is to help companies keep	proprietary
	  information from accidently leaking out.

I am considering a Kaypro as a general-purpose home machine and terminal,
because I like the price and the Perfect Software.  It would also be used
heavily as a terminal, though, via 212 modem to UNIX.
Does anyone have experience with the Kaypro for word-processing and other
CP/M stuff, and as a UNIX terminal?  What software do you use for terminal
emulation and file upload/download?  Any advice for me?

Subject:  XMODEM 5.1

	I have taken the liberty, as I usually do, to modify the XMODEM.FOR
program to match my tastes, as I do with most PD software I lay my hands on.
If anyone is interested, it is in AR90:CPM as XMODEM.LQR.  This LBR file
contains 8 or 9 files, including a new source and COM (VAX Command) files.
The big differences between 5.0 and 5.1 are that (1) 5.1 is radically
restructured internally, employing more structured programming techniques
and fewer GOTOs, and (2) 5.1 supports the ST and RT options, wherein XMODEM
internally converts from CP/M text file format to VAX/VMS text file format
and back as required.  Also, two new VAX/VMS commands are available, called
SEND and RECV, which transfer text files only with conversion (intended to
be used as frequently-needed functions).

	Enjoy!

P.S.  Keith, would you let the author know about this and provide him
with a copy if he wants one?  Thanks.

                 Public Domain Responsibilities
                       By Richard Greenlaw
     From Dr. Dobb's Journal, Number 81, July 1983, Page 10

To DDJ Readers and CP/M Users,

	Over  the  years  that DDJ has been serving  us,  I  have 
contributed on article (a disassembler in issue no. 27), a review 
of the PC-1 pocket computer (in issue no.  52) and a few letters.  
However,  this contribution is a bit different.   The bottom line 
of this letter is a warning!

	I  am  the  author  of a set  of  programs  which  is  in 
widespread   public   domain   distribution   (at   least   three 
continents).   They are called SQ.COM, USQ.COM and FLS.COM.  They 
run  on CP/M systems and serve to squeeze files to smaller  sizes 
in   preparation  for  transmission  via  modem  or  distribution 
diskette.

	The latest version of these programs are 1.5, 1.5 and 1.1 
respectively.   I  released these programs to the public  domain, 
except  for financial gain,  and included full source code (in  C 
language)  and  extensive documentation.   This software  is  now 
available via the C Users group, which has advertized in DDJ.

	Having  had reasonable experiences with  previous  public 
offerings,   I  gave my name and address in the documentation and 
in the sign-on message of each program.  Therein lies the story!

	In recent months I have had a couple of dozen phone calls 
claiming  that  these programs have  destroyed  various  innocent 
files.   But when I ask for details,  I find that the programs in 
question have version numbers higher than any I have ever issued!  
Not  only that,  but many different version numbers,  as high  as 
1.9, have been mentioned!

	I  expect  that  whoever produced each version  of  these 
programs was as innocent as I was in August of 1981 when I ussued 
the above-mentioned programs.   But the fact remains that one  or 
more  persons has taken it upon themselves to propagate  modified 
versions  of  my  software without taking the  responsibility  of 
adding  their name and address to the documentation  and  sign-on 
messages.

	It is an unfortunate fact that C and probably other high-
level  languages  can crash impolitely when the CP/M TPA  is  too 
small  for the program and its data space,  including dynamically 
allocated  local  variables.   (These programs do  use  recursive 
algorithems).

	I have heard,  without confirmation, that vast amounts of 
code  have been added to some versions of these programs  to  add 
wild card file name processing.   Perhaps this is the problem.  I 
provided that feature as a separate program,  FLS.COM,  precisely 
for  that reason.   It is also possible that full and careful use 
of the recompilation options available in BDS-C has been  abused, 
resulting  in too much code or improperly linked code.   Or maybe 
there  have  simply  been  some accidents  in  copying  or  modem 
transmission.

	Whatever  the  case,  I  recommend  that  if  you  modify 
software which you have not written, then try to consult with the 
original author before publicly distributing such  software.   If 
that is not possible, at least accept the responsibility of being 
the  first  line of complaint handling by adding (not  replacing) 
your name to the documentation and sign-on message.

	If  anyone has a file which the above-mentioned  versions 
of my programs cannot squeeze and then reproduce,  please contact 
me.   My  computers  can read and write  the  following  diskette 
formats:  Micropolis  Mod  II,  Max-80 5" 40  track/side  (SS/DS, 
SD/DD)  formats,   Osborne  Single  Density,  Omikron  5"  single 
density, Xerox 5" single density.  Except for the Micropolis, all 
of the above are handled by my Lobo Max-80 computer.

	Do  you  really  want  more  public  domain  source  code 
sofrware?    If  so,   and  if  you  know  the  source  of  these 
modifications,  please  help stamp out the bad versions (copies?) 
of  this software.   Unfortunately,  I don't know  exactly  which 
versions are bad because not one single person has ever sent me a 
courtesy copy of any modifications!

	To  those  bewildered innocent victims,  the  unsqueezing 
precess contains a validity check based on the original file.  If 
you  can produce a file (not just a console display)  by  running 
the  USQ.COM program,  then the resulting file should be an exact 
replica of the original.

	I  also ask purchasers of communications packages  who  I 
have  authorized to distribute this software not to assume that I 
am  responsible for the communications packages.   It seems  that 
reproduction of my documentation files makes my name and  address 
more prominent than those of the commercial distributers!

Re:   Can Sinclair Be Used As CPM Board for C64?

Well, I can't speak for the Sinclair (since I don't like it); but as
for interfacing the 64 to another computer, I have definite plans in
that arena...

I have an interface between my VIC-20 and my 160-K Z80-S100-CP/M
system that allows the CP/M system to be an intelligent peripheral to
the VIC20 --- for storage of files, andoutput to the printer (the
interface "supplants" the CBM serial bus devices #8 and 4).  I plan to
extend this interface (consisting of a pair of programs I call VICNET,
plus an 8255 on the S-100 bus connected to the VIC user port) to allow
either end to emulate a terminal for the other end, as well as an
option to effectively turn the VIC into an intelligent graphics
terminal, as seen from the S100 (CP/M) system.
  Last week, I picked up a C64 programmer's guide, and was pleasently
surprised to find that the KERNEL interface for the C64 is
functionally identical to that of the VIC! The result?  My software
should be pretty easily transported to the 64, providing a much more
powerful peripheral for the CP/M system (or vice-versa).
  I plan to somehow market the package (including a graphics package
to run on the 64 (I have one about 50% completed for the VIC), that
will effectively convert the 64 into a graphics display terminal.  A
complicating factor in this effort is that fact that the product is
not a "pure" software product; there is a hardware interface involved.
That may drastically affect any marketing considerations...

If anyone is interested in what the package does now, along with what
I plan for it to do when it's completed, let me know, and I'll write
it up and pass it along to the list.

(please don't consider this a commercial plug, as the project is not
yet -- and may well never be -- a commercially available product.)

There is a slight problem with the latest version of umodem (umodem32.c).
A modification to set a logfile default was done in this version and it
will fail to work on some systems because the modifier used a bitwise
instead of a logical 'NOT' to flip a toggle.  The fix is probably not
worth changing the revision number, but I did so  here to avoid confusion
(and besides, I use RCS).  Following is a diff between 3.2 and 3.3 (disregard
the first line, which is RCS info).

Subject:  using SQ and USQ
To: info-cpm@brl

can someone tell me just what you do to use SQ and USQ on ITS in file
transmission to a CP/M machine?  Presumably I need to squeeze a file
on MC, send it to my cp/m system, and then unsqueeze it.  what's the
unsqueeze program called?

Can this be done for mail reading as well?

sorry about asking so basic a question...

Re:   Ackerman Digital's Circuit and Pulse programs

  I've just finished evaluating Ackerman Digital's CIRCUIT
and PULSE programs, which are programs written to perform
linear circuit analysis.  The programs are provided in
compiled MBASIC, and they are real dogs!  There is
absolutely NO error checking, and the programs blow-up
even with the examples in the book!  Only about a third
of the software promised in the manuals is provided on the
disk, and the manuals provided are for different
versions of programs than the ones on the disk.

  I'm mentioning this here, because I would hate to see
anyone *screwed* by buying these rip-off programs.
Naturally, source for the programs is NOT provided, so
there is absolutely nothing that the unfortunate user can
do to make the programs work.

Subject: MDM711 now available on MIT-MC
To: Info-Cpm@brl
cc: INFO-MODEM7@mit-mc

Irv Hoff has just released MDM711, the latest version of the MODEM7
series.  The files are on MIT-MC as:

AR61:CPM;
  MDM711 AQM  --  The squeezed source code for the main program
                  (not normally needed but here for reference)
  MDM711 LBR  --  The LBR file that contains MDM711.COM, DOC, and
                  all the user overlays and patching instructions.
  MDM711 TXT  --  A brief explaination of what files are available.

NOTE: The AQM and LBR files are stored in ITS "COM file" binary format.
      The TXT file is ASCII text.


For those who have not been following the MDM7xx series, here's
some information on new features that have been added and bug
fixes that have been made.  If you haven't updated your MODEM7
program lately, you're missing out on a lot of exciting new
features.  Notice that the program now also supports "smart modem"
users.

  NOTE: MDM711 SUPPORTS AUTO-DIALING AND AUTOMATIC CONTINUOUS
	REDIALING FOR THE FOLLOWING MODEMS:

		a)  PMMI 103 PLUG-IN S-100 MODEM
		b)  HAYES SMARTMODEM 300 OR 1200
		c)  U. S. ROBOTICS 300/1200 MODEM

	   THIS IS THE ONLY EXISTING PROGRAM TO SUPPORT ALL
	   THESE MODEMS CONCURRENTLY.  CHECK THE FOLLOWING
	   THREE BYTES IN ANY OF THE OVERLAYS.  (YOU CAN
	   STILL USE THE PROGRAM WITH OTHER EXTERNAL MODEMS
	   SUCH AS THE BELL 212A, RACAL-VADIC, ETC., WITH
	   MANUAL DIALING.)

		0103H	FF = PMMI, 00 = NON-PMMI
		0104H	FF = HAYES SMARTMODEM 300 OR 1200
				OR U. S. ROBOTICS 300/1200
			00 = NONE OF THE ABOVE
		0105H	54 = "T" FOR TOUCH TONE DIALING, OR
			50 = "P" FOR ROTARY PULSE DIALING
				(FOR HAYES OR U. S. ROBOTICS ONLY)

***********************************************************************

07/01/83  Changed TERM to allow use of printer port for modem use.
	    Needed by the Morrow MD and NEC 8001 computers.  Changed all
 MDM711   overlays to allow overprinting the PMMI parity routines as
	    the Applecat overlay was not working properly.  Removed the
	    short break tone during disconnect as Smartmodem 1200 were
	    locking up.  (Smartmodem 300 were operating normally.)
					- Irv Hoff

06/17/83  At last.  Program now has autodialing and auto-continuous
	    redialing for Hayes Smartmodem 300 or 1200, PMMI 103 modem
 MDM710   or U.S.Robotics.  After first unsuccessful try, asks if you
	    want to quit, try once again, or continuously redial.  Also
	    changed the BYE routine to be compatible with systems other
	    than RCP/M.  Now trap 87H and 7H which are sometimes used by
	    mainframes to signify "do not send any more sectors at this
	    time".  This keeps the original Christensen protocol when
	    ACKNAK is set YES.  (ACKNAK can of course be set to NO if
	    the results seem preferable to the user.  Some problems have
	    been noticed in batch transfers and modem-to-modem use with
	    ACKNAK set NO.)		- Irv Hoff

05/27/83  Corrected a phone number in the library.  Added a CR/LF for
	    the quiet mode if using batch transfer.  Simplified initial-
 MDM709   ization at startup.  Two minor mods to assist in adding an
	    overlay for Hayes 300/1200 SmartModem later.
					- Irv Hoff


05/15/83  Extensive revisions on many parts of the program.  Relocated
	    most of the PMMI routines near the start to facilitate using
 MDM708   the new 300/1200 PMMI board or the Hayes Smartmodem.  Some
	    of the more ambitious changes include:
		a) CRC system replaced with the high-speed lookup tables
		   similar to those used in CHEK15.
		b) Separate printer buffer.  Can now print regardless of
		   input speed even when saving for a disk file.
		c) Printer buffer and disk buffer each can accept up to
		   128 characters after an X-OFF to compensate for line-
		   oriented systems and satellite linking.
		d) Saving to disk made far more user-friendly.  'NOL' no
		   longer used.  File automatically closed upon exit.
		e) Sector count shown before "ACK" is sent, allowing
		   high-speed transfers (to 19,200 baud) without errors.
		f) Typing BYE on command line or CTL-D in terminal mode
		   disconnects and returns to CP/M.  Also closes any disk
		   files that may be open.  "X" (secondary option) does
		   the same thing, allowing automatic terminate at com-
		   pletion of file transfer.
		g) Improved the "E" (echo) mode, also half duplex mode.
		h) Control characters above ^M not passed to the CRT, an
		   optional feature.
		i) Handling of command line options greatly modernized.
		j) For PMMI users, program automatically comes up in
		   originate mode at default speed.  No need to ever say
		   TO.300 unless a baudrate change is desired.
		k) Simlified and changed numerous flags to be consistent
		   with others.
		l) Several improvements in error handling and detection.
	    Numerous other changes.  We attempted to incorporate all the
	    suggestions forwarded from various users in addition to some
	    features I wanted myself.   - Irv Hoff

01/01/83  First version.  Can be assembled with ASM.COM.  MDM700 was
	    selected to commence a new series of version numbers.  This
 MDM700   can be readily used on data bank systems that limit file
	    names to a total of 6 characters.

You asked some time back if MDM7xx does anything smart when in the
CONTROL-Y mode.  It sends an X-OFF and then buffers up to 128 MORE
CHARACTERS while it waits for the other end to quit sending.  It then
writes to the disk and then sends X-ON after resetting its pointers to
the start of the buffer.  The file is not closed until you issue the
WRT command from the command prompt.  This allows almost unlimited
size ASCII captures.

In-reply-to: Msg of Wed 29 Jun 83 17:50:00-EDT from Jon Albers <ALBERS at NLM-MCS.ARPA>

Hello, Jon.  You asked what the format is for the files on MC.  That's
a rather large question to answer.  If you meant MDM711 files, the
.AQM and .LBR files are stored as "COM files" in binary format.  This
means that if you FTP the files to yourself, you'll have to use the
8-bit binary mode in FTP for those files.  You'll get them intact,
complete with the 4-byte header that is used on ITS "COM files".  You
can get rid of those four bytes by running ITSCVT on them (see
AR13:CPM;ITSCVT HEX).
   Some files are stored in ASCII and some are stored in ITS COM file
(binary) format.  The usual way to know which is which is to look at
the file name.  If it has COM or AQM or WQ or DQC as the last part of
the filename, it's stored in ITS COM file format.  This is necessary
because those are binary files - the COM files and the squeezed files.
   I haven't had the time to split the MDM711 LBR down to individual
files and them upload them to MIT-MC.  That takes a lot of time.  So I
did the next-best thing and uploaded the whole .LBR file.  You'll need
LU.COM to extract the files.  If you can't fit this on your Osborne
disk, the best way to get it would be to call any RCPM system and use
the XMODEM L command to extract the .COM and Osborne overlay files
from the LBR.

Eric,

	I have been running the Optronics board on my s-100 system for over a
month with no adverse effects.  In fact, the soft error rate on my disks
(DT8's) due to dirt, etc. seems to have gone down sharply: one error
since the installation, as opposed to one or two a week before.

On the negative side, the documentation could have been better, since
this is not for the casual hardware hacker.  While I found the
installation to require only about 20 min., homework prior to
installation was about two hours.  The bottom line here is how
off-the-wall your drive's option configuration is & how familiar you are
with the same.  Depending on if you're running something really, ah,
customized (?) or not, things can get hairy, though the Optronics board
should work just about anywhere.

On balance, I'm quite happy with the installation.  Good luck.

Subject:  Special Circuit Breaker Wanted!
To: INFO-CPM@brl, INFO-MICRO@brl

As some of you may know the MACSYMA Consortium will be dissolved come
1 October, and we have been advised to make alternate plans because
the future of the MIT-MC machine is not clear at this time.

I have been making alternate plans for some three years now, and have
new host up on the net which has space reserved to hold all of the
files currently in MC:CPM; and then some, including all the archives
for both lists, and all of CPMUG and SIG/M files...

Unfortunately, we cannot keep the new machine up while no one is
present in the building because we cannot consider the air
conditioning system to be 100% reliable, and the building is in the
middle of the desert...  Thus, we are up only from 8:30am to 9:40pm
MDT weekdays...

So, we have devised a scheme to brute-force cut the power when the
temperature reaches a critical point.  This scheme requires either an
externally controlled three-phase circuit breaker or some sort of
relay-driven crow-bar switch, with a capacity of approximately 75-100
amps per leg!  We have yet to find a solid lead on such a device, and
hope that perhaps someone reading this mail can help.

Address any replies directly to me, and not either list, please.

Thanks,

The following excerpt from MDM711.INF will explain what each of the
files is for.

TOPIC :  MDM711 MODEM PROGRAM INSTALLATION INFORMATION
FROM  :  IRVIN M. HOFF W6FFC

       This program is based on one originally written by Ward Christ-
ensen in September 1977.  It has since undergone a considerable number
of changes.  Recent changes include auto-dialing and continuous redial-
ing for the Hayes 300 or 1200 Smartmodem and the U. S. Robotics, along
with the standard PMMI 103 routines the program has supported since its
inception.

NOTE:  Special configuration files are being added for specific types of
       computers.  Several are available as shown below.  Others will be
       provided for popular computers using external modems.  This file
       will be updated accordingly.

       To adapt this version to your equipment, you will want to get
some of the following programs:

        Program name    Squeezed Name          Purpose

        MDM711.ASM      MDM711.AQM        (source code file)
        MDM711.COM      MDM711.OBJ        (object code file)
        MDM711.DOC      MDM711.DQC        (how-to-use file)
        MDM711.INF      MDM711.IQF        (information file)
        MDM711AC.AQM    MDM711AC.AQM      (AppleCat II overlay file)
        MDM711AP.ASM    MDM711AP.AQM      (Apple II overlay file)
        MDM711DP.ASM    MDM711DP.AQM      (Datapoint 1560 overlay)  
        MDM711GP.ASM    MDM711GP.AQM      (General purpose overlay)
        MDM711H8.ASM    MDM711H8.AQM      (Heath/Zenith H89 file)
        MDM711HZ.ASM    MDM711HZ.AQM      (Heath/Zenith Z-100 file)
        MDM711KP.ASM    MDM711KP.AQM      (KayPro overlay file)
        MDM711MD.ASM    MDM711MD.AQM      (Morrow MD overlay file)
        MDM711NE.ASM    MDM711NE.AQM      (NEC PC-8001 overlay file)
        MDM711NM.ASM    MDM711NM.AQM      (Phone number overlay)
        MDM711OS.ASM    MDM711OS.AQM      (Osborne overlay file)
        MDM711PM.ASM    MDM711PM.AQM      (PMMI S-100 modem overlay)
        MDM711TV.ASM    MDM711TV.AQM      (TeleVideo TS-802 overlay)
        MDM711XE.ASM    MDM711XE.AQM      (Xerox 820 overlay file)

       (The minimum would be any pair in one of the examples shown
below.)

       There are several ways by which you can set the proper ports,
status pin values, etc. for your equipment.

     1) Use your editor, ASM (or MAC)  MDM711.COM    and
        and DDT (or SID) with:         MDM711xx.ASM

               (711xx stands for an appropriate overlay)
                                                             or
     2) Use your editor, ASM (or MAC)  MDM711.ASM

        One of those should appeal to you.  The program is designed to
work immediately for PMMI users with no changes - just use MDM711.COM.
(You might wish to change some of the available options, however.  It
is set to use base port 0C0H.)

        When ready to use the program, type 'H' (for 'HELP'), hit RET
and it will display helpful information on the commands.  There are so
many commands there are several pages.  You can abort the display with
a CTL-C.  (One of the most useful features being CTL-P to toggle your
printer on/off.)  You can also type a question mark (?) which shows the
current parameters.

        The program has received numerous worthwhile optional features
in the past several months.

Subject: ZCPR2 Implementation for KAYPRO II

File CPM;AR84:ZCP-KP LQR contains all the files needed
to install ZCPR2 on the KAYPRO II.

This file was originally put together to help some people
who have KAYPRO IIs, but who are too new to CP/M
hacking to be prepared to tackle the task of installing
ZCPR2 from scratch.

The version of ZCPR2 provided includes MULTIPLE COMMAND
BUFFER, but does NOT include NAMED DIRECTORIES or WHEEL
functions (which make little sense on so small a
system as KAYPRO II).  Also, I/O redirection is not
included.

The content of ZCP-KP LQR are a detailed
DOC file that is intented to be used by
a complete CP/M novice, and two HEX files
to overlay the KAYPRO II owner's own CP/M.
I originally put this material together to put ZCPR2
on my son's KAYPRO, and am making it more widely available
with R.Conn's approval.

To use:
          1.  Download
          2.  Unsqueeze (using USQ.COM)
          3.  Extract all files (using LU.COM)
          4.  Read the DOC file and follow instructions.

Subject: Non-Heath 8" disk drives on H-100/Z-100 systems
Article-I.D.: lanl-a.359

We are having a problem using Siemens FDD-100-8 series disk drives
with the Heath h-100 computer.  The problem revolves around the track-to-
track step times.  It seems the system comes set up for 3ms step times
but the Siemens (and Shugart 801's) are slower than this.  The information
we have received from Heath has been insufficient to solve the problem.
The symptoms are: Select errors on boot.  Sometimes we can read directories
and close-in files. Other times we can't. The drives have been checked on
another system that used a WD1791 controller and seem to be OK.
Has anyone had any experience with this problem that might be helpful to us??
The Siemens drives would be a real bargain if the frustration could be 
eliminated.

P.S.  I think I have figured out a reasonable scheme for adding error
correction (I'm unsure of the performance, though.  I don't know of any
method other than brute force searches through the dictionary.)  Even
if correction doesn't work, there will at least be options to accept and
correct words manually during the Spell run.

Is there a description of the multiple-file transfer aspect of the MDM7xx

to upgrade UMODEM (the UNIX version of the MODEM protocol transfer

done this (if so, please let the rest of us share in your work).

Also, has any thought been given to upgrading the MMODEM program at

rate is available.
The system is a "CALL-BACK" system and the hours
it is online are:
 SUNDAY, MONDAY, TUESDAY  10 A.M. to 6 P.M. PDT
 FRIDAY  10 P.M. PDT to SATURDAY  10 A.M. PDT
 and the phone number is (213) 799-4583 ..

Call-back means to dial & let it ring 1 time, hangup & call back
If it rings more than 3 times, the answering machine will answer,
so consider that warning that the system is not up.

Expect to be disconnected if online outside posted hours.
If you call outside posted hours, an answering machine will
get you.

The files 'READ-ME.NOW'  and  'USER.MAP'  and  'HELP'  on the
system should be read.

Uploads are to be sent to the regular system Pasadena CBSS/RCPM
at (213) 799-1632, this goes for messages too.

Now that the frivolity is out of the way, I desparately need some info
on the DEC Rainbow. Rice is running a summer computer camp using these
beasties, and I (being our resident CP/M type system hacker) got elected 
to provided technical support. 

My problems are many; my resources are few. I will supposedly be
getting a technical manual sometime in the next month or so, but that
will be a bit too late.  Any help that can be provided will be muchly
appreciated. And now, my problems:

1) I need to be able to format disks for the 100. There is (as best I
can tell) NO format utility supplied with it.  Q: Is there one that I
am just not seeing? Q: Does ANYONE out there have one? Q: Does anyone
know what the disk pararmeters (tpi, sides, skew factor, etc.) are so
that I can write my own on a REAL machine?

2) I need to pipe some stuff over from a very different machine. 
It is, however, another CP/M machine, so I could PIP from it's RS232
port to the Rainbow's communications port. Q: How is the communications
port defined in the Rainbow IOBYTE? Is it defined in the IOBYTE? Q: Is
there a more convenient way to do this? (I was planning on PIP'ing in
HEX mode, as it is a HEX file.

3) Should I just give up and throw it (physically) out the window?

Thanks. Replying to me is a bit difficult. Please use one of the

Info-CPM readers who have an account on MIT-MC should be VERY careful
about using USQ on MC.  Please don't use it unless you know its commands.
We have had two occasions recently where ARchive files were messed up
because users didn't know that the default output of USQ goes to the
SAME DIRECTORY as the input file.  Most of the ARchive devices are
filled to capacity and this causes them to exceed the safe limit.
This corrupts the Archived files making it necessary to restore the
entire ARchive.

I just made :CPM;USQ defaultly output the file to your home directory, so
you don't need to be very careful anymore.

Note that you can direct the output to any file you want, by doing
   :CPM;USQ input file, output file

Guest users of MC should use this form to place the output in a file
obeying the naming conventions of group directories, e.g.
   :CPM;USQ AR203:CPM;BIG WQN, MYNAME BIGWIN

KERMIT is a protocol for transferring files between computers of all sizes
over ordinary asynchronous telecommunication lines using packets, checksums,
and retransmission to promote data integrity.  Microcomputer implementations
of KERMIT (and some of the mainframe implementations) also provide terminal
emulation.  KERMIT is non-proprietary, thoroughly documented, well tested, and
in wide use.  The protocol and the original program implementations were
developed at Columbia University and have been shared with many other
institutions, some of which -- particularly Stevens Institue of Technology --
have made contributions of their own.

* KERMIT Implementations

KERMIT is presently available for the following systems:

    Machine             Operating System    Language
    -------             ----------------    --------
    DECSYSTEM-20        TOPS-20             MACRO-20
    DECsystem-10        TOPS-10             MACRO-10
    VAX-11              VMS                 Bliss-32, Macro-32
    IBM 370 Series      VM/CMS              IBM Assembler
    VAX,PDP-11,SUN,etc  UNIX                C
    PDP-11              RT-11               OMSI Pascal
    8080, 8085, or Z80  CP/M                ASM
    8086, 8088          PC DOS, MS DOS      IBM PC Macro Assembler
    Apple II 6502       Apple DOS           DEC-10/20 CROSS

All but the UNIX version and RT-11 versions use or imitate the TOPS-20 style
of user interface - command keyword recognition and completion, ?-help, etc.

The 8080 version runs on the DEC VT180, DEC Rainbow-100 (speeds up to 1800
baud only), DECmate II (CP/M), Heath/Zenith-89 and 100, Intertec Superbrain,
Apple II with Z80 Softcard, TRS-80 II (CP/M), Osborne 1, Osborne Executive,
Kaypro II, Vector Graphics, Ohio Scientific, Telcon Zorba, and others.  The
8086 version runs on the IBM PC and lookalikes (such as the Compaq portable)
and on the Heath/Zenith-100.

* Distribution Policy

The KERMIT software is free and available to all, sources and documentation
included.  Columbia University has been charging a reproduction fee of $100
for mailing tapes to recover its costs.  Other sites are free to redistribute
KERMIT on their own terms, and are encouraged to do so, with the following
stipulations: KERMIT should not be sold for profit; credit should be given
where it is due; and new material should be sent back to Columbia University
so that we can maintain a definitive and comprehensive set of KERMIT
implementations for further distribution.

* Distribution Mechanisms:

In addition to direct distribution from Columbia, KERMIT (all the versions
listed above, as they existed in June 1983) has been placed on the DECUS
VAX/VMS and RSX-11 SIG tapes, and may, at some point, be added to the DECUS
library for DEC-10's and -20s, and also distributed through IBM SHARE.  In
addition, the KERMIT distribution is available at Columbia to users of BITNET
on host CUVMA.

* ARPAnet Distribution:

Now KERMIT is available in its entirety to the ARPAnet community.  An up-to-
date KERMIT distribution area will be maintained on the Columbia University
Computer Science Department DECSYSTEM-20, a new machine which as just been
added to the ARPAnet.

The KERMIT distribution can be found at ARPAnet host COLUMBIA-20 in the
directory PS:<KERMIT>, accessible via anonymous FTP.  This is a large area,
containing sources (and in some cases binaries or hex) of all implementations,
plus documentation and various utility programs -- presently over 2000 DEC-20
pages in about 170 files -- so you probably don't want to take the whole area
blindly.  First, look at the short file 00README.TXT (starts with two zeros,
always appears at the top of a directory listing), which explains what is
where, and then take the parts that are of interest to you.  The KERMIT area
on COLUMBIA-20 should now be considered the definitive source for KERMIT on
the ARPAnet; other areas where parts of the KERMIT distribution have been
available will not necessarily remain current or complete.

The major documentation for KERMIT is the KERMIT USERS GUIDE and the KERMIT
PROTOCOL MANUAL, on line as USER.DOC and PROTO.DOC, respectively.  The User's
Guide gives an overview, general instructions for use, and details about the
use and installation of each version, including procedures for initially
downloading microcomputer versions from a mainframe host.  The Protocol manual
is supposed to describe the protocol in sufficient detail to allow new
implementations of KERMIT to be written.

KERMIT is an active project.  Features are being added to existing
implementations, bugs are fixed, new implementations are being developed.
Towards the end of August (when I return from vacation), I'll set up a KERMIT
mailing list for reporting bugs, trading information, announcing new versions,
etc.  In the meantime, send comments and inquiries to me at this ID, though I
won't be able to answer for a while.

 The C user group cost $10 per year.  This only an approx cost since
 it is supposed to be for 6 issues of the newsletters which "should"
 be published bi-monthly.  The past year has not seen this happen though.

 The big benifit from membership is that you can get the latest BDS
 version for $8 when you join and send them a copy of your license.
 They do have a considerable amount of software available and this
 can also be purchased for $8 per disk( 8" SSSD ).  There is no
 catalog as such but you do get back issues of the newsletter which
 list the offerings.

 The group has recently expanded to cover all micro C's (but only
 BDS is offered for update).  The group does support several
 Cnodes around the country where the software from the library is
 available for downloading.

To: decvax!wivax!linus!philabs!cmcl2!lanl-a!jp@ucb-vax.ARPA, info-cpm@brl.ARPA

I am using a Shugart 851 and a CDC drive, both 8-inch and double-sided,
on a Z-100. They work OK, under both CP/M-85 and ZDOS.
However, occasionally they don't; I will get a seek error, especially
on FORMAT. Usually rebooting fixes this up.  This problem is only on the
Shugart, not the CDC.
I tried changing the step rates under CP/M and ZDOS using the info in the
Zenith manuals. This fixed up the CP/M-85, but not the ZDOS.

This caused me to find out about ANOTHER problem. The MAP command
on ZDOS 1.1 will not let you declare a drive imaginary, so it can
share a physical disk with another drive.
I called the Zenith hotline and they mailed me a new version.
This works, except now there is no way to make a drive un-imaginary.
There is no switch for it, and MAP/Z, which is supposed to reset
the drive configuration, does not affect imaginary drives.
I called Zenith back and they said it is supposed to work this way.

we haven't gotten an acceptable demo from our local dealer (due to his

Subject: More on Rick Rump's "Disk Maker" 5-1/4" disk machine
To: INFO-CPM@mit-mc

Mine has been delivered and installed, and it works beautifully, allowing
for teething problems typical of first units shipped (mine is THE first).
For the $1200 price tag (not $1400 as earlier reported, though the price may
go up if Rick wants any dealers to be able to afford to carry it!), you get
a Suntronics controller, one DSDD 40 track 5-1/4" drive in a 2-drive cabinet,
cables and software. An optional second 96 track drive may be obtained.

The software consists of three programs and a database file. One program
configures the system to your specifications (clear-screen string, drive-group
where the drive(s) will be addressed, and error diagnostic options); the
second program formats floppies in one of the 25-odd supported formats; the
last program "installs" the drive as emulating one of the formats. That is,
a typical sequence to produce a disk in , say, Osborne format would run as
follows:
	1. Run DMFORM.COM to format the disk. It comes up with a menu, you
	   pick number 1 (Osborne), and it goes and formats/verifies the
	   disk
	2. Run DMSET.COM, pick menu number 1, and it echoes the string:
	   Disk Format is: Osborne SSSD
	   A> (or whatever)
	   at which point you're back at CP/M command level with drive D:
	   (or whichever you've configured it to be) being an Osborne format
	   drive. Any time you warm-boot, the "Osborne" message flashes to
	   remind you you've got the Disk Maker emulator running.
	3. Now just write your data onto drive D: any way you want (PIP,
	   SWEEP, CP, whatever) !! All normal CP/M commands, such as STAT,
	   work fine on that drive and tell you all the things that apply
	   to an Osborne drive.
	4. To switch to another format, just run DMSET again and pick another
	   format.
Once a format has been installed with DMSET, the drive may be both read from
and written to just like any CP/M drive. The following formats are supported
in my version, with more coming probably soon: Osborne (90K, 183K); 
TRS-80 Mod I Omikron, TRS-80 MOD III MM, Xerox 820 (82K, 155K); 
IBM-PC (CP/M-86) 154K; Kaypro II; TI professional; Televideo 802/803;
Zorba; Otrona Attache; Superbrain(162K, 340K); Heath H-37 (148K, 304K);
Heath Magnolia; Heath Z-100 (148K, 304K); NEC PC-8001A; Access;
Dec VT180; DEC Rainbow 96-TPI (with optional 96-TPI drive).

The software is terse, well-executed and effective. Obviously the system
is expandable to new formats by obtaining updates to the database file.
HARD-SECTORED FORMATS ARE NOT CURRENTLY SUPPORTED, although some thought is
being put into this problem.

Again, this neat little package is available from New Generation Systems,

separate from the actual data files?  Can you generate a schema
file to describe a file that FMS-80 didn't write?  Is it worth
the $395 that they are charging?
   If possible, I'd like to have any responses by Tuesday (19
Jul 83).  Thanks for your help.

	Does anyone know of a program like xmodem that uses the kermit file
transfer protocols?  This program is to be used as Xmodem is used with MDM7 type
programs.  I would like to use this in conjuction with xmodem on an RCP/M.

I heard last night that the new PMMI modem will be available the 3rd
week in August.  I also heard that they haven't forgotten me and I'm
still on the list to get one.  There was apparently some last-minute
problem at the Racal-Vadic factory that required Craig to fly out
there one or more times.

I'm sending this from the new home for the CPM software archives.
This machine is still in the testing phase, however.  We'll make an

I have been trying to get around the bug in the TAC software that
prevents the use of MODEM on TOPS-20 and umodem on Unix hosts.

I found a way to make it work:  BEFORE you connect to your host,
do @B O S to start binary output on the TAC.  This fixes the
problem and I have sucessfully use both MODEM and umodem today through
the TAC.  You must do this before you connect to your host or it won't
work.

Subject:  Morrow BIOS bug!
To: info-cpm@brl
cc: GRUPP@mit-mc

The BIOS supplied with my Morrow M20 hard disk had a bug in the DPB.
This BIOS has equates for the M10, M20, and M26 so if you have one
of these drives with supplied BIOS, you might want to check.

PROBLEM;  The DPB reserves 512 directory entries, but the AL0 and AL1
          reserve space for 4 time that.  This means that there is
          48K of unuseable disk space.

TO FIX;   Edit the BIOS file equates for your drive (2 DPB's for M10
          3 DPB's for M20 and M26) and change the DRM and or AL0 & AL1.
          I chose to make 1024 directory entries (as I was running out
          of dir space before disk space).  To do this set DRM=1023,
          AL0=0FFH, and AL1=0 (check that the block size is 4K (BSH=5)
          or else these values will have to be changed as per the D.R.
          manual).  Then assemble the file and use DDT to overlay the
          hex file on your sysgen immage, and save.

IF YOU CAN'T fix this yourself (best NOT to try if you don't know) don't
worry...  The bug has no effect on the operation of the system other than
waisting some disk space.

--Paul

P.S.  The FIX I described will give you 1024 directory entries and 32K
      more file space, and will NOT disturb ant pre-existing files or
      directory entries.

                          Los Altos, CA 94022

Fellow Computer Hobbiest:

     Several  friends and I have been trying to use the popular  CCS2422 
Floppy Disk Controller board in our S-100 systems.  We encountered a few 
problems  which cost us substantial frustration until the solutions  had 
been worked out.  We had tentatively thought that we had bad EPROM's and 
bad  disc  controller  IC's before making  the  modifications  described 
below.   The IC numbers refer to the rev.  B board, the changes apply to 
the rev A board as well.

     1.  The buffer which drives the data-in bus,  U40,  has to drive  8 
lines  at the same time.   Depending on the configuration of the rest of 
the  system,  it  may have a peak current of 1/2 amp or more for  a  few 
nanoseconds.   Although this IC is close to the S-100 ground pins(50 and 
100),  this current has to flow through traces which are common to  the 
rest  of  the board.   I have actually seen this current surge  cause  a 
voltage  spike  of 2 volts.   Needless to say,  this can and does  cause 
false inputs to many of the other IC's on the board.  The solution is to 
cut the trace on the top side of the board to U40, pin 10.  Next, on the 
back  side,  connect  U40,  pin 10 by a piece of insulated wire  to  the 
ground trace near pin 100,  and continue the wire around the edge of the 
board  to the top side near pin 50.   Number 28 or 30 wire-wrap wire  is 
suitable.  The  inductance  of the wire is primarily a function  of  its 
length.  There is little to be gained by using an 18 guage wire.

     2.  Although  the  ground  traces  appear at  first  glance  to  be 
connected together, there are several places where a ground trace starts 
at  one  side of the board,  goes to several IC's and then stops in  the 
middle of the board.   Your DC ohmmeter will measure continuity, because 
the  traces  are connected by long paths around the edge of  the  board.  
More  reliable operation of the 2422 can be achieved if these  "dangling 
ends"  are  connected together.   The candidates for connection  are  as 
follows:

          U7   pin 7  to  U8   pin 20
          U20  pin 7  to  U21  pin  8
          U13  pin 10 to  U14  pin  7
          U35  pin 7  to  U44  pin  8
          U39  pin 7  to  S-100 pin 50

If your system uses the S-100 pins 20 and 70 as grounds,  the should  be 
connected in as well.

     3.  This  one  corrects  one  of the  symptoms  of  the  inadequate 
grounding  mentioned  in 1 and 2.   Historically,  it was  found  first, 
because the board would often hang up in an "Auto-wait" state when using 
the monitor EPROM.  Short spikes on SOUT or SINP propogate the the logic 
to  the clock U42A when the CPU is really accessing a memory address  of 
F733.   This  change  prevents short spikes from clocking the Auto  wait 
flip-flop but has no effect on desired operation.
     Cut  the  +5v trace going to U42 pin 2.   It is on the back of  the 
board  and you do not have to remove the IC or the socket to get to  it. 
(Hurray!)  Now connect pin 2 to U35 pin 11.   This is the logical OR  of 
SOUT and SINP.  In the case of a short spike, this point will be back in 
the logic low state before the clock signal gets to the flip-flop.

     4. Some of our boards did not work with some of the Western Digital 
IC's.   The  problem  was  most  pronounced  with  5  1/4  inch  drives.  
Eventually  we found that the problem is that the board design  requires 
the  WD1793 to operate outside of its specified range.   In  particular, 
the data sheet requires that the data inputs be held for 70 ns after the 
end  of the write pulse.   However,  the 2422 actually switches off  the 
data  bus  buffer  before  sending the write pulse to the  1793  or  the 
control latches.   It is only the PC board capacitance which causes  the 
circuit to work!  The solution is to keep U39 turned on a little longer.  
There  are several solutions,  but the most reliable is to substitute an 
unused  section  of open-collector NAND gate U5 for the section  of  U20 
which drives U39 pin's 1 and 19.   Connect U20 pin's 4 and 5 to U5 pin's 
13 and 14 respectively.   Cut the trace to U20 pin 6 and connect a  wire 
form  that trace to U5 pin 12.   Connect a 1K pullup to U5 pin  12,  and 
somewhere  along that trace connect a 80 to 100 pF capacitor to  ground.  
This will slow down the rising edge of the signal to U39 pin 1.

     After  these  changes,  the CCS2422 works quite  well.   With  some 
experimental  changes  to  the  wait-state  circuitry,   one  board  has 
successfully  done disk operations with a CPU clock speed in excess of 6 
MHz.   More  work  remains to be done before claiming  that  a  complete 
speed-up can be reliably achieved.

     The  problems  with inadequately engineered ground connections  and 
buffers  which are turned off too early are not unique to the CCS  2422.  
You  might keep them in mind when you have problems with other  circuits 
which  give  erratic  behavior.   I hope this  letter  helps  make  your 
computer experience more enjoyable.

Or, perhaps more efficient, modify FP.COM to work on the word list in

MDM711.FIX                July 14, 1983

There is a problem with MDM711,  in that when you are transfering 
files  in  the ASCII mode the CTRL 'Y' character that is used  to 
toggle  open  the  memory buffer is not  trapped  by  the  MDM711 
program.   By not trapping the character it is sent to the system 
you  are downloading from.   In the case of many mainframe systems 
the Ctrl 'Y' character is decoded as an EOF and the command  that 
you  were  using to transmitt the ASCII text will  be  terminated 
before you are able to capture any of the text.
 
There is a simple fix which can be made by using DDT or a similar 
type  program  to  modify the MDM711XX.COM file  you  are  using.  
This  fix does not alter the code but it does vector the  program 
off  to a MORE correct location than it is now.   All the tests I 
have performed so far seems to indicate that the change does  not 
cause  any furthur problems except for the fact that now only the 
Ctrl 'Y' is trapped, but the Ctrl 'R' (used to close your capture 
buffer) is still passed to the transmitting system.   As fas as I 
know the Ctrl 'R' will not cause any problems if it does you will 
need to modify the MDM711.ASM file at NOLST1: (123C H) TO NOLST3: 
(125D H) so that it works correctly.  

I  was reluctant to make changes to the MDM711.ASM file since  it 
was so new,  and this simple single byte 'FIX' seems to take care 
of the problem.
 
STEP 1 :     A>DDT  MDM711XX.COM
               DDT VERS 2.2
               NEXT  PC
               4300 0100
STEP 2:        -S125C            Type in S125C and then CR
STEP 3:        125C  10  44      Type in 44 and then CR
STEP 4:        125D  19  .       Type in . and then CR
STEP 5:        -G0               Type in G0 to exit DDT

STEP 6:        A>SAVE 66 MDM711XX.COM  (File now modified)


Thats  all you need to do to the program.   You can do it to  the 
MDM711XX.COM  file you are using or to the MASTER MDM711.COM file 
that  is  in the MDM711.LBR file.   If you do it  to  the  MASTER 
MDM711.COM file then it will propogate to other configurations of 
the MDM711 program with the proper overlay file.

     o    As the MM-103, the modem requires 4 contiguous ports
     o    Deliveries are due to start late August
     o    Orders are being taken now

     From a reference in the brochure, as well as being able to 
read the name off of the chip in the cover photo, it looks as 
though Racal-Vadic had a bit to do with the developement of the 
MM-212, nothing wrong with that. I only wish that they had 
somehow been able to keep the programability of the MM-103.

     I myself plan to try the approach of leaving both modems in 
the system, and online. The MM-212 will do all of the answering, 
if a Bell 103 carrier is detected,( modem sends an "L" ), then I 
plan to switch over to the MM-103, and go through the normal baud 
checking that most of us are used to. Otherwise, the MM-212 will 
handle the call entirely. Now, my first impression of that crazed 
thought is that there will be a lot of code laying around, but 
seeing how the 212 seems to be dream to control versus the Hayes 
300/1200, I'll sacrifice a few nights and weekends of work, and 
trade 1/2K or so of code to do it! The flexibility will be 
enormous for us S-100 users...

     I hope this has shed some light on what PMMI is doing these 
days. By the way, the suggested retail is $695.95, not bad 
considering what it would cost those of us without an open serial 
port to add a quad board plus an external modem. And you still 
might not be able to get all of the features.

I have the Racal Vadic 212PA modem.  It looks like they just
did a little modifying to the code on the software side since
the features look identical.  The PA is a nice modem, but a
real *pain* to program to dial, etc.  The PMMI should be
easier.  

I had a PMMI 103 attached to a TRS-80 (Model I no less) and
was very pleased.  It will be interesting to see how this new
board works out.  $700 is not cheap, and Vadic and offspring
are not known for their discounts...  -r

JRT has a long history of taking many (3-6) months to ship
orders.  This is strictly illegal for a mail order firm, of

them down yet.  I suspect this is because nobody has more than
$30 invested, so it's not worth the trouble to any one individ-
ual.  
 
   If you really want it, I suggest you invest a little more in
a few phone calls, and try to get some action.  Or, better, find
someone who already has it and copy it (legally) from them - then
cancel your order and save $30.  Contact your local computer club,
or RCPM system.  

   If you're looking for a reliable Pascal compiler, I suggest
you forget the JRT product entirely.  It has too many bugs to
be useful for production work.  It's ok for playing, I guess.

Hi, Arlene,

	ZCPR2 is located in ARs (Archives) 80-86 of the CPM directory
on MIT-MC.  It is also located on other machines, one of which will
be transitioned to after September when MIT-MC *may* be lost to the net.
Announcements of this transition will be made to INFO-CPM by the
host when he is ready.

	The directories (ARs) are referenced by AR8x:CPM where x=0 to 6.
MIT-MC is a glass house, and you can use FTP (IF binary transmission
is available to your host) to transfer the files in these ARs to your
machine.  Pure binary is stored here (executable images), so the
transfer must be an 8-bit transfer.

If anyone has has purchased dGRAPH to run on their CPM system using

familiar:
     "Overlay Loader:  .PRG file missing or truncated"

The problem occurs because both California Computer and FOX & GELLER
use locations 50-->5B hex.  The fix is simple and is described in Jerry
Pournelle's July 83 column in BYTE (pp 353).

You have to modify your BIOS to move the DEBLOCK PARAMETERS out of page 0
of memory.  Use your editor to modify the CCS BIOS as follows:
  1. Find and delete the statement
     IDSV:   EQU 4EH   ;Sector ID Save area
  2. Find the statement
     BEGDAT  EQU$
  3. Add immediately after the statement defining BEGDAT
     IDSV:   DS  8
  4. Assemble the BIOS and install as described in the CCS manual

Are you referring to CCPM-86 rather than a method of using both
processors simultaneously? I would thing that the latter would be much
sexier. I am aware of some development in this direction elsewhere
(not at DR nor at Zenith) but it is premature for me to comment
further. Rest assured that if and when anything comes to fruition on
this front, I will certainly advise the net. Zenith hardware looks
excellent to me (sure wish I had a Z-100!) but they are falling flat
on their face in the software arena. Good thing there are a lot of

Subject:  CPM-816
To: goldfarb.ucf-cs@rand-relay
cc: Info-CPM@brl

CPM-816 is now available for the Compupro system running an 8085/88
board. The minimum requirement is the CPU, a System Support 1, and
128K or 192K of memory (I cannot recall that one) and of course a
disk-1 controller. There are two ways to obtain this, one being
directly through Compupro, the other (cheaper) way is directly from
the author at Proper Software, 1024 Center Street, Berkley, Ca. 94704.
You must send your original CP/M-86 disk along with a $50 payment.
They will add the modified loader, CCP and SW!.CMD file to your disk.

Oh yes, an brief explanation of CPM-816 is in order - it allows you to
run 8-bit or 16-bit applications under the same operating system. If a
.CMD file cannot be found, it looks for a .COM file. If found, it will
re-parse the command line into the form

		SW! FOO ZOT

SW! is the switch command that sets up the 8-bit environment; the
operator originally typed FOO ZOT and there was no FOO.CMD present,
but there was a FOO.COM file. A bonus is that the 8088 does all
operating system calls and you have a 62K TPA. I have yet to run
across a .COM file that would not run properly, though I have not
really been beating on it for too long.

Subject:  Hard Disk Utilities

        I have just uploaded several hard disk utilities  from  a
recent SIG/M disk of that topic.  They are in AR15:CPM on MIT-MC.
CRCs check.  These utilities are:

Name            MIT-MC Files            Function

BIGBURST        BIGBUR ASM & DOC        Copy a file from a hard disk
                                        to several floppies, where
                                        the file is too big to fit
                                        on just one floppy

FLOPCOPY        FLPCPY ASM & DOC        On a hard disk/one floppy system,
                                        copy files from one floppy to
                                        another thru the hard disk
                                        automatically; this copies all
                                        files from the source floppy to
                                        the hard disk and then tells you
                                        to insert the dest floppy, at
                                        which time it copies all files from
                                        the hard disk to the dest floppy,
                                        deleting the files from the hard disk

MULTCOPY        MLTCPY ASM & DOC        Backs up a hard disk onto multiple
                                        floppies; assumes the largest file
                                        can fit on one floppy

        The BACKUP program  from  the  same  set  is  similar  to
MULTCOPY  and was already in AR15:CPM.  All programs were written
and contributed by Gary Young in North Hollywood, CA.  I have not
tried them myself, but I have heard that they work well.

        Enjoy!

Subject:  FILER and VFILER

are now on MIT-MC in AR87:CPM.  This contains versions  of  FILER
and  VFILER  designed  to  run on 8080's or Z80's (FILER 8COM and
VFILER 8COM) and designed to run on just Z80's  (FILER  ZCOM  and
VFILER  ZCOM).   Online documentation as FILER HLP and VFILER HLP
is also in the AR.

FILER is an  enhancement  of  DISK76C  which  has  several  added
features  for the ZCPR2 environment.  It allows the user to chain
to another program, such as XDIR, from within FILER and return if
the  MCL  feature is enabled.  There is a built-in help for quick
reference and a detailed help which chains to HELP FILER for more
information.   Also,  the DU form is supported throughout as well
as the DIR form: hence, you can  log  into  or  copy  into  other
directories  by  using  names  such  as  "7" (for user 7, current
disk), "B" (for current user, disk B), "B7" (for user 7, disk B),
and  "WORDSTAR"  (for  a  directory  named  WORDSTAR).   It  also
includes other features over DISK76C.

VFILER is an  enhancement  of  FILER  which  is  totally  screen-
oriented,  designed  to  run  on  a  CRT  which  supports  cursor
addressing.  VFILER is quite nice to use, allowing you to use the
arrow  keys on your CRT (or the Word Star movement keys) to point
to a file on the display.  At this time, you may  issue  commands
such  as  C  for  copy,  T for tag (for later copy/delete), D for
delete, M for mass copy of all  tagged  files,  and  Y  for  mass
delete  of all tagged files with or without verification.  VFILER
is very human-oriented and even fun to use.

Thanks to Hal Carter, Charlie Strom, Frank Wancho, and Ron Fowler
for  ideas  and  suggestions about the design of FILER and VFILER
and for testing it.  I really  think  these  programs  make  nice
additions to the ZCPR2 System.  They both have to be installed by
GENINS (current version is OK), and  VFILER  requires  additional
installation as documented in its Help File.

The file VFSC ASM is used to patch VFILER  ?COM  for  the  screen
controls.  Enjoy!

To: info-cpm@mit-mc
Reply-To: BLC@jpl-vax

I have been using the U.S. Robotics Password ($380 from the 
Bottom Line) for about 2 weeks. 
 
1)	Although I don't know how smart the Hayes unit is, the 
Password has a number of options, all programmed by sending 
ASCII strings to the modem. 

	a)	Number of times to let the phone ring before 
		answering. 
	b)	Tone or pulse dialing. 
	c)	Time to wait after dialing for carrier. 
	d)	Time to leave the monitoring spekaker on
		(default is from time dial command is given
		until carrier is established.)
	e)	force answer mode (can also be set with DIP switch.)
	f)	Local echo (also known as half duplex.)

2)	There are several other options, which don't seem very
important.

3)	Once carrier is established, the onlyhing the modem will
respond to is a one second pause followed by +++ followed by
another one second pause. Four pluses are ignored. (the +
character can also be programmed to any other character.)

4)	The unit seems to run hot. Only time will tell if
this is a problem or not.

Subject: CP/M-86 and CCP/M-86 on Z-100
To: info-cpm@BRL.ARPA

Having just signed a non-disclosure agreement, I expect to
receive a pre-release copy of CP/M-86 for the Z-100 from
Zenith in the next few days. Official release to the general public
will be early September. 
I also have Version 2.0 of ZDOS (MSDOS), complete with pipes,
subdirectories, etc. I'm not sure of the general release date.
It looks like, as part of my summer job, I will be porting
CCP/M to the Z-100. If anyone knows of this already
being done, let me know so I can avoid the trouble!
As far as I have been told, Zenith is not porting CCP/M
at present, and DR is not going to port it to anything
but the IBM PC.

Final note: Can anyone give me advice on converting aa
CP/M-86 BIOS to a CCP/M XIOS?  DR covers the conversion in
one page of the manual, and it looks fairly straightforward,
but any experiences will be appreciated.

Would it be possible for someone on ARPANET to send me copies of
these two programs configured for a Z100 (CP/M-85 and/or MS-DOS,

Article-I.D.: dadla-b.500

I noticed an article from someone who was waiting for the PMMI
S-100 Bell 212 modem.  He (and anyone else waiting for such) should
wait no longer.  U. S. Robotics is already shipping their S-100
modem which is based on the Auto Dial 212A which has been out since
December.  At $350 (my price in onesies) it has the PMMI beat before
it gets started.  Don't put too much stock in the Vadic parentage;
I am not suprised at the delays in getting it out because the Vadic
212s are incredibly antiquated technology, loaded with 3-4 times
the parts of the USR, most of them 1% analog stuff, and Vadic is
losing their quality control.  USR's modems are cheap because
they don't have much inside; just 3 micros, 14 I. C.'s total, and
not much analog stuff.  I have delivered about 60 with only a couple
of DOA's.  I don't normally advertise like this, but I hate to see
people wait around so they can waste their money...

  The compiler is EXPENSIVE compared to the others on the market (2-1/2 times

Cc: CCVAX.ty@nosc

We have played around with several "C" compilers one of them being the
EcoSoft C compiler, another being Aztec's, and finally Software Toolworks.
EcoSoft's had a significant code generation problem in our view and that
was when you defined an array of say 8k EcoSoft's assembler output was not
at all efficient.  It generated a:
	rept	8k
	db	0
	endm
This allowed you to go to lunch twice before the assembler finished. The
other 2 "C's" just did a "DS 8k" and that was that.  Just that 1 item caused
us to pretty much abandon EcoSofts.  There were a few other minor items which
I do not recall right now.  The real problem was that we could not take a 
source and compile it using these 3 compilers plus the one on our UNIX system
and come out with 4 executables.  All compilers would have to complain about
some syntax or another and no one complaint was common amoung them. So much
for transportability.  Aztec's had a fairly complete library whereas Toolworks
is somewhat limited.

	Yes, there is a Pascal-to-c translator, available from Whitesmith's.
It is written in their version of c, and the source is available.
It produces super-slow c, but is acceptable in a pinch.  The program is
small and attempts to put loop control into register variables.  
The resulting code is poor because:

	1) It is unreadable.  No c variables are retained by their origonal 
		names.  
	2) The referencing if enclosing proceedure's variables (so casually 
		done in Pascal) is ineffecient.

	But it does work.  In many cases, that's all that matters.

Subject:  New ZCPR2 Utilities

AR87:CPM on MIT-MC contains two new ZCPR2 utilities -- FIND and UNERA.
Both are installed by GENINS (actually, no installation needed for UNERA).
CRCs check.

UNERA, like the other PD UNERAs, is used to unerase files, but this one
is integrated into the ZCPR2 System with the consistent syntax.  The form
of this command is:

	UNERA afn,afn,afn,afn,... o

where as many ambiguous file names as desired can be given.  Built-in
documentation, invoked by simply typing UNERA with no args or UNERA //,
tells you how to use it.  UNERA normally places the unerased files into
the current user.  There are options to:  Pause for disk change, Place
files into User 0, and List erased files.

FIND, like FILE13, is used to search all disks and user areas for
a set of files.  Again, being consistent with the ZCPR2 syntax, FIND
has the following form:

	FIND afn,afn,afn,... o

FIND produces an alphabetical listing of all matched files by disk.
FIND does not include System files by default, and the only option, S,
enables it to include these also.  FIND is installed by GENINS, and
GENINS may be used to restrict its range (in terms of disk scanned
and maximum user area scanned).


Both utilities are quite small, under 2K in size, and both run very
quickly, using direct BIOS calls to move through the directory.

	Enjoy!

We just got CCP/M (Concurrent CP/M) for an IBM PC from Digital

MS-DOS has a RDCPM command to go in the opposite direction,
but we want to move "C" programs we wrote for Lattice C to
CP/M so we can try the DR C compiler.

Subject: getting MODEM903 to work

The following is most of a letter that I wrote to someone today
who asked me for help on getting his VT180 up with modem7.  The
resulting treatise turned into such a magnum opus that I decided
to post it to the net so that the novices among us would have some
quick information available to them.  If you already know all about
ftp'ing com files and lbr and sq and usq and itscvt then skip the
rest of this:

	MODEM903 is a version of MODEM797 and MDM707 that includes
a version for the VT180.  It works perfectly, too!  To get this
wonderful thing, here is what you must do: (this is all for Berkeley Unix
and may have to be modified is your host is something else.)

1.	ftp mit-mc	;ring up the mit-mc machine

2.	get 'AR13:CPM;ITSCVT HEX' itscvt.hex	;get an ascii image of
			;this Intel Hex format program.

3.	get 'AR13:CPM;LDIR 211HEX' ldir.hex	;get this while at it

4.	get 'AR13:CPM;LU 211HEX' lu.hex		;and this too
 
3.	type local	;this causes binary transfers, but with appropriate
			;conversions between word lengths of the DEC 10 at
			;mit-mc and my vax.  Your command for this may
			;differ.  Consult local system guru, or experiment.

4.	get 'CPM:MODEM 903LBR' modem903.lbr

5.	bye		;leave ftp.  Some ftp's can't do more than one get
			;per connect (like mine) so you may have to invoke
			;ftp and bye out of it multiple times.

6. 	port all this stuff over to a CPM computer.  I assume you have
	access to one besides the VT180.  It should have at least 241K
	disks attached, or some of this will be a real !@?#@!#.

A>load itscvt		;make itscvt.com out of itscvt.hex
<messages from
 load.com>...

A>load lu		;make lu.com

A>load ldir		;make ldir.com

A>itscvt modem903.lbr
Translate, Skip, Quit, or Continuous? T
opening file
done				;we have just removed the four garbage
				;bytes at the start of the file that are
				;and artifact of the ftp process.

A>era modem903.lbr		;erase original file to make room
A>ren modem903.lbr=modem903.cpm	;use output of itscvt which has CPM extension

A>lu -o modem903 -e *.* -x	;invoke library utility, open the library
<messages from lu.com		;extract all files, and exit. (I think this
about its progress>		;is right.)

A>usq *.?q?			;now unsqueeze all the files from the library
				;you may have to do them one at a time
				;and erase the squeezed versions if you have
				;tiny disks.

Now read the file HOWTOASM.DOC and do what it says.  The file 8250SYS.ASM
is already configured for the VT180 and only needs to be renamed SYS.ASM.

A>ren SYS.ASM=8250SYS.ASM
A>lasm modem903.aaz
A>mload modem903

Now use MBOOT3 to bring the finished MODEM903.COM over to the vt180.  The
file is 17K in size, so you might be able to send the MODEM903.HEX over
using pip or pipmodem and load it on the VT180 using LOAD.COM.  (Although
there is a different loader supplied in MODEM903.LBR that you are
supposed to use instead of LOAD.COM.)

This isn't really related to a terminal, so am sending to these two lists.

We have uncovered a problem with the new FX-80 printer.  Specifically, the
printer will "eat" one valid, printable, preceding character for every DC3
not immediately following a LF character.  Has anyone else seen this
problem?  It occurs frequently using SCRIPT on an IBM VM/CMS system.  Other
printers, including the MX-80 predecessor do not err in similar
circumstances.

In fairness to Ecosoft, their intent was to initialize the array to zero
(see discussions in net.lang.c about this).  Nevertheless, it ought to be
made an option; there are many cases where the array initialization is
unnecessary and slows the assembler down a lot.

If you need a program to create LU format libraries for transfer
to a CP/M based personal computer, I have written one.
The basic idea is to combine files on the Unix machine and then transfer
them in one operation to the personal computer.  There the program LU
can be used to extract the files out.

It is called lar.c and has been posted to net.sources.
You ARPANET folks can probably find it on MIT-MC soon.

Subject: Zenith Z100 news
Article-I.D.: hou2b.69

These comments on the Zenith Z100 were reported in Sextant:   The 
Independent  Magazine  for the Entire Zenith  Computer  Community 
(Summer,  1983  issue).   Most  of them are from a  question  and 
answer  session at the Eighth West Coast Computer Faire in  March 
of this year.

"Barry  Watzman  of  Heath/Zenith  recently  told  Sextant   that 
standard  CP/M-86  will  be available for the Z100  'probably  in 
1983.'   This  is a little sooner  than  planned,  Watzman  said.  
CP/M-86 wasn't originally a very high priority item, until Zenith 
software  developers  say that it had been announced in a  Zenith 
Data Systems software catalog - by mistake.
...
"Unfortunatley,  it has been more difficult than was  anticipated 
to  make IBM PC software work on the Z100.   software written for 
the  PC  is  'optimized'  to take best  advantage  of  the  IBM's 
keyboard  and  screen display functions;  the Z100  keyboard  and 
screen display are different.   Those functions are controlled by 
read-only memory (ROM).  Zenith Data Systems expects to release a 
new  ROM this summer which will duplicate more functions  of  the 
PC's ROM,  enabling Z100 uses to use the developing PC-compatible 
software pool."
...
"I've  found a 'kludgy' way to use escape sequences on the  Z100.  
I  use  the  'insert special character' feature of an  editor  to 
create  a text file consisting of the appropriate  escape  codes.  
Then  I  went back to Z-DOS and TYPEd the file to  the  screen... 
There should be an easier way, though."
...
Barry Watzmann on CP/M Plus:   "I cannot say definitively that we 
will or won't [provide it].  It all is a question of priorityies.  
My personal feelin,  to the extent that it matters,  is that  we 
should  do 3.0 (CP/M Plus) on the Z100 as an upgrade to  CP/M-85.  
I would hope that we might be able to do that in August,  give or 
take a couple of months."
...
Barry Watzmann on Concurrent CP/M:  "We are not currently working 
on Concurrent CP/M or MP/M [the multiuser version].  I personally 
wish that we were,  but the fact of the matter is, we aren't.  We 
are  working  on  some networking stuff."
...
Barry Watzmann on MS-DOS 2.0:  "MS-DOS 2.0 we will definitely do.  
There's no question about that.   There has been some  discussion 
internally that some of the resources to get CP/M-86 out and some 
of  the resources to get MS-DOSthey're  allocated to CP/M-86,  and that may change.   I kind  of 
don't  want  to  see that change;  I'd like to  see  CP/M-86  out 
already.   But  we  will definitely be  doing  MS-DOS  2.0.   I'm 
tempted to back off on 'definitely', but I believe we will see it 
this year for certain, possible by the late second or early third 
quarter.   There  will  be extreme pressure on us,  with the  IBM 
announcement, to get that out."
...
Barry Watzmann on the 8087:  "Yes, alot of thought has been given 
to  that [the 8087].   I don't have an answer for you right  now.  
But we have a strong desire to fit the 8087 to our  machine,  and 
there  is work going on to accomplish that goal...  I am  hopeful 
that, at some point before the end of the year, we willbe able to 
make an announcement regarding that."

Watzmann  also Announced that Microsoft FORTRAN and  COBOL  would 
soon  be  shipped  and that UCSD p-System,  version IV  would  be 
shipped in May.

One  additional note:   Barry Watzmann,  the Zenith Data  Systems 
computer  product line director,  resigned from Zenith at the end 
of May, so he cannot be held to these words.

I understand that different ROMs in the Osborne change the addresses

Subject:  Re:  zcpr2 and unsqueezing

Russ - With regard to your file unsqueezing problem, it seems likely that
you are having the same problem we on the BRL UNIX machines have had in
transferring binary files from mit-mc.  MC is a 36-bit machine, and packs
binary files four-bytes-to-the-word.  The remaining four bits are filled
with zeros, and at least in our experience, those four-zeros-per-word are
delivered along with the desired binary information when files are FTP'ed.
Two people here have dealt with this problem:  One, Joel Kalb <jkalb@brl>
has written a CP/M program to remove the junk, but I guess that won't help
you since you want to correct the files while still in the UNIX domain.
The other person, Steve Segletes <steven@brl>, has written a C program
which works well, but is still being polished, and which runs under UNIX.  Both
of these programs also strip-off the first four bytes of the recieved binary
file.  These bytes are put there by mc as part of the file-transfer process,
and are not part of the desired file.  To see whether you are having the 
same problem we are having, I suggest you try the same experiment we did here:
FTP both the ASCII-hex file and the resulting COM file for some convenient
program (such as, AR13:CPM;CRCK 44HEX  and  AR12:CPM;CRCK 44COM) and then
use the UNIX utility OD with the hex-byte option to get a hex-dump of the
COM file (and maybe print the first ten lines or so).  Then compare what you
got with what it was supposed to be as read from the ASCII-hex file.  (If
you don't know how to read Intel hex format records, send me mail and I'll tell
you, or alternatively, transfer the hex file to your CPM system and LOAD it
to get a clean COM file which you can dump using DDT.)  If you are having "our"
problem, you will find that the first four bytes of the FTP'ed COM (binary)
file will be 93 3A D8 00 (in hex), and that from there on,  each four bytes of
desired data will be preceded by four junk-zeros.  This will cause the first
four program bytes to be shifted-right by four bits (for example, C3 34 12 F3
will be changed to 0C 33 41 2F 30), and then the next four junk-zeros will
bring the next four bytes back into proper registrtation.  This pattern will
repeat for the rest of the file, giving five bad bytes, four good ones. five
bad, four good, etc.  The programs written by Steve and Joel strip the first
four bytes and then throw-out the first four bits of each 36 bits thereafter.
They work like a champ.  If you are having this problem, your unsqueezer will
not be able to recognize the mess as a squeezed file, much less unsqueeze it.
As a final note, I guess I should say specifically that squeezed files must
be moved as BINARY files using the image-mode (i.e.,TYPE IMAGE) of FTP.  If
you haven't been doing that, you have probably gotten a lot of extra carriage
returns added to your binary data by the UNIX FTP server.  Use image-mode for
squeezed files.  We have had no trouble moving ASCII files from mc to our UNIX
machines (both PDP-11 and VAX), but until the two post-processors were written
binary files were 100% frustration.  If you would like copies of either of the
post-processors, send netmail to steven@brl for the C program, or jkalb@brl for
the CP/M version.  Both work.  Good luck!

OK, I give up; what's modem9xx?  that is, vs. mdm7??.  And I suppose
that there is some confusion on the net of all the various version and

modem9??, tmodem, etc.?

For that matter, it probably would be instructive to see a review of all
the commo packages, both commercial and public domain, available for cp/m

Gary Little draws a parallel between JRT Pascal slipping on deliveries
of their $40 compiler and big companies (such as defense contractors)
slipping several months on their deliverables.

Defense contractors get paid *after* they produce.  (Just try getting
the federal government to pay in advance on an order!  I have, and they
don't.)  JRT requires payment in advance, cashes the check, then sits
on the money for several months.  This is in violation of laws designed
explicitly to protect the mail order buyer.  If a merchant does not
ship your product within thirty days of accepting your payment (i.e.,
cashing your check or debiting your credit card), you can and should
contact the postmaster at the merchant's post office and complain that
you are the victim of mail fraud.  An investigation will ensue.  (Write
to Postmaster / City, State ZIPCODE)

My wife and I sell mail order software "on the side", and we've been
known to delay many weeks between receipt of an order and its shipment,
usually because the software is being upgraded or we're out of material
such as three-ring binders.  However, we make a practice of cashing the
check AFTER the product is shipped.

I don't think the problem is with xusq107.  I am the one who hacked that for
the Vax and 4.1bsd, I haven't ever had any problems since I got it going on
this machine.  Here are some places where you might be going astray:
       1)  Not compiling xusq107.c with -DVAX
       2)  Not using the -b option of umodem to transfer the file (if you
           are using umodem).
       3)  Not stripping the ITS "stuff" off of the squeezed file after
           you get it from MIT-MC.
       4)  Not setting "Tenex" mode for the FTP transfer.
If these seem elementary, I am trying to cover all bases.  Let me know if
I can help you further.

If you are getting all your bits and bytes shifted around, you are using
the wrong mode in ftp!  In addition to specifying image mode, you should
also specify "8-bit bytes".  ITS will then take care of extracting the
bytes from PDP-10 words in the correct way.  I gather different unix ftp
programs have different commands, but I'm told at least one of them does it
this way:

	ftp mit-mc
	type i
	quote
	type "l 8"

You will still need to strip the 4 header bytes (which I'm told you can do
with a general-purpose utility called 'dd'), but you certainly shouldn't
have to shift anything around!

Intel's Fortran 86 compiler is good, it supports Fortran 77 with
character data types, ect... However it is expensive, and currently runs
under the RMX 86 operating system and the ISIS series III os.

It compiles routines to run with a 'large' model segmentation- ie every
routine has its own code and data segments.

Dave, you can get away from the binary zero padding problem on FTPing
binary files from MIT-MC if you simply tell FTP (on BRL or BMD) that
you want the 8-bit byte mode.  The command at BRL and BMD that does
this is "tenex".  If you do this before transferring binary files from
MC, the only thing you'll have to do to make them CP/M compatible is
to strip off the first four bytes.  These first four bytes are added
to COM files by our Christensen-compatible MMODEM program so that it
and other programs can later tell the difference between ASCII and
BINARY files.  I have written a program, ITSCVT, which runs on your
CP/M machine, which removes the first four bytes of ITS-style "COM"
(binary) files.  It's available in AR13:CPM;ITSCVT HEX

XMODEM, UMODEM, MODEM2xx, MODEM7xx, MODEM9xx, TMODEM, and MDM7xx ALL
use the SAME Christensen protocol.  There are no "flavors" except for
an OPTION for using a CRC error checking mode instead of the original
CHECKSUM error checking mode.  This run-time OPTION is available in
all of the above-named programs except for UMODEM and TMODEM.

MODEM9xx is a generic MODEM7xx program for serial-port modems.  It
does NOT support the PMMI S-100 modem.

MDM711 supports PMMI S-100, D.C. Hayes "Smart Modem", U.S. Robotics
intelligent modem, AND serial port modems.  Many user overlays are
provided for easy customization of the MDM711.COM file, so it is NOT
necessary to get the .ASM file to bring up this program.  Future
support will be provided for the new PMMI MM-212 (1200 baud) S-100
modem.

MDM7xx, MODEM7xx and MODEM9xx all provide a "batch transfer" OPTION
which allows more than one file to be transferred without operator
intervention.  Again, this is an OPTION and can be considered an
extention of the Christensen protocol rather than a violation of it.
It does not have to be used.
