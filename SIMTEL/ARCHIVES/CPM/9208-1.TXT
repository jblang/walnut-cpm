	I know that this may not be the best place to talk about this,
but is the only one I know, so here it is:  I have an Osborne Executive
which seems to have a problem that does not allow it to read its disks.
 In fact, the drive whirls for some time and it prints an error message
(boot error?).  Any suggestions of what should I do?

Yep, that is a nicely-built machine.  Messed with one extensively

The serial port is nothing more than a 6551 addressed at Slot 1's
addresses.  I'd have to consult the docs (if the organization who
owned it still has it) for the parallel port.

Like I said, if the organization which owned the Basis 108 I
used still has it, I will see about getting schematics.  No
guarantees, though.

My biggest piece of advice is make sure that the serial card that
you use has a 6551 ACIA.  The 6850 gave me no end of pain on the
cards I have it on.

Good system.  I must agree.  I started messing with computers
with such a system.

There was a Patch Disk which was delivered with the Basis 108. On that disk there
was a program to modify the OS-disks from Apple and the DIFF's as a HEX-dump.
The Patch-program took the HEX-dump and modified the bytes in the System.
The most important Patches had to deal with the 80 Chars display, which was absolute
incompatible to any 80 chars display I saw for the Apple II. As far as I remember
it was quite easy to apply those patches. I hope you can get them somewere, but I
think they are copyrighted.

PS: I think that Patch-disk was readable with DOS 3.3, UCSD-Pascal and CP/M,
    but was not able to boot at all.

I too have the "preliminary" spec sheets for the Z800 and Z80,000.
I doubt they went very far.
I recall hearing that the Z800 was done in NMOS and the Z180
replaced it, being CMOS.
I used to chat with Steve Ciarcia and crew at the Trenton Computer shows.
I admitted that I am a Zilog fan and wished that he had used the
Zilog chip instead of the Hitachi.
He too lamented Zilog's lack of availability and higher price,
thus the Hitachi part was more available and attractively priced.

I still have several Z80 systems ready to run.
I'll post about them when I'm ready to rejuvinate those projects.

Message-ID: <4640212@neptons.UUCP>

I was asked to get a TRS80 Model 4P that was a $20 garage sale
special working.  It appears that the owner swapped the drives
and changed the jumper settings in trying to get the system
working.  I diagnosed the problem as a bad switching supply and
now have the supply working.

The problem now is that on power up, one of the drives turns on
for a while and then a

CASS? 

is displayed on the screen.  I have not seen any reference to
the CASS? in the manual.  After hitting the return a couple of
times the system goes into BASIC.

The spacebar also does not seem to work on the keyboard.  Can
anyone out there please tell me the proper disk drive jumper settings
and which is drive 0 and drive 1 (upper and lower)?  I seem to
have the CPM disks for the system also, but I can't get any disk
to boot.

Thanks,

Roger

The z800 was started in NMOS but changed to a CMOS design when it
became apparent that NMOS was a dead end. Along the way, Hitachi came
out with the z180 and Zilog became a second source for that part. About
this time, Zilog realized the z80,000 (and their z8000) would never be
a hit. They decided to climb on the z180 bandwagon by renaming the
z800 as z280. The z280 has been available since 1989. I know, I
upgraded my CPM system to one over 2 years ago.

Not exactly.  Zilog did indeed have a z8000 (not 80,000).  The stillborn
z800 became the z280, not the z180.  The hd64180 was an independent
development by Hitachi.  When Zilog and Hitachi made a deal for 
Hitachi to make the z280 (z800) Hitachi agreed to let Zilog make the
64180 and call it a z180.

The Z80,000 was Zilog's ill-fated 32-bit processor. The last I heard about
it (many years ago) was that Zilog was going to change its target market
to the military. Presumably it never got done.

Message-ID: <1992Aug06.045659.17702@blkbox>

Where may I write to obtain programmers' reference materials for
either the Hitachi HD64180 or the Zilog Z80180?

I'd like a U.S. address for Hitachi if possible as I have an HD64180-
based system.
Also, what is Zilog's address.  Failing Hitachi, I'll ask Zilog for the Z80180
reference manuals/data sheet.

Better yet, If anyone out there has an extra or knows who else I might
contact to get ahold of this information, please send me email, or
post if anyone else might be interested in this kind of thing.

Of course ordinary programming is similar to the Z80 except that instruction
timing is different, but I'm also interested in using the internal '180 devices
so I need info on those.

Thanks.

Hi,

I was given a TRS80 Model 4 that was found at a Garage sale with
all disks for both the TRSDOS and CP/M 3.0, but only the manuals
for the TRSDOS.  Does anyone out there have a CP/M PLUS manual

I am quite familiar with CP/M 2.2, but the 3.0 is new.

Try checking your phone book under Electronic Equipment & Supplies.  
The ones in this area are Hall-Mark Electronic Corp, Kimball Electronics inc,
Marshall Electronics, Milgray Electronics, etc...
Find the rep for Hitachi and they should have or be able to get these books:

	HD64180 8-bit High Integration CMOS Microprocessor User's Manual
	#U77
	October, 1985 (Couldn't find an 88 version)

The Programming Manual and Users Manual were most usefull to me.

22DISK for reading various disk formats and 22NICE, an emulator were
written by a company called SYDEX in Sunnyvale, California, USA.  The
company seems to be out of business since the phones are no longer
connected.  Can anyone tell me if SYDEX or the 22DISK author is still

Subject: ARK V1.1 Problem - Help ?
Message-ID: <1992Aug11.103344.24971@nessie.mcc.ac.uk>

I recently downloaded ARK V1.1 from a mirror archive of Simtel-20 and have
been using the program to compress WordStar document files and save myself
some disk space.

I hit a problem when I tried to archive a disk containing 128 files (the
maximum number of entries for the CP/M format I am using - Gemini QDDS). All
went well for the first 64 files. Instead of 'Adding' the next file to the
archive ARK started 'Updating' an earlier file in the directory !  There 
followed a long list of 'Updating' files.

Is there a fix for this problem ?


Many thanks,

Peter Green.

Subject: question for kaypro experts
Message-ID: <1992Aug11.150759.21158@cfa203.harvard.edu>

Here is a question for Kaypro experts.


I have a Kaypro 2, ROM 81-292. It has 2 drives and 2 serial ports.
The only software I have is a "wordstar and mailmerge" disk,
which works fine in the machine, and I can use "dir", but do
not have "format" or "copy". So, I figured I need a system disk of some sort.

So, I ordered a system disk from Don Maslin, who keeps the CPM archives.
Don sent me two disks DSDD, the system (cpm 2.2g) and a comm program disk, MEX.

There is a problem.  The machine can not boot off of the system disk.
Also my machine does not show anything on the disks!

If I load the mailmerge disk, I can use the dir commmand.  It
shows for the cpm disk something like....

A0>dir a:
A:  :   :   :
A:  :   :   :
A:  :   :   :
A:  :   :   :
A:  :   :   :
A:  :   :   :
A:  :   :   :
A:  :   :   :

and for the MEX disk
A0>dir a:
A:  

The machine cannot use the system disk.
It hangs and all I get on the screen is
                 *Kaypro*
A

Any experts recognize this?  Is it a disk format problem?
It looks like dir sees something on the disk, but can't give 
the directory.

Thanks for any help in advance.

Nope, they just moved.  If I remember, I'll bring in their address tomorrow.
Just a short while ago, I sent out a note on 22DISK, 22NICE, and ANADISK ...
Shareware from SYDEX which is of interest to CP/M'ers.

I don't have a copy of that note anymore, but it included their new address and
telephone number, a short description of the programs (from SYDEX's README
file) and the new cost for the programs (they went up $5 to $15).

I think the problem is the system disks you have.  A Kaypro 2 of that
vintage (I think that rom is probably one of the first, what's the
serial # on your machine?) is definitely SSDD disks.

Yeah, I seem to remember something like that being the sign of trying to
use double-sided disks in the machine.

Go back to Don and tell him you need single sided disks.  CP/M 3.3 fits
just fine on 2 191 K disks (but you really only need one to boot, the 
other is just additional utilities.)  It's an honest mistake--later
models called Kaypro 2 have double-sided drives, however the Kaypro II
(which is most likely what you have) does not.  

I might be able to help you out, but I haven't booted my Kaypro in
months and am not sure it's still working.  Changes are Don's a better
shot anyway.  Good luck.

I didn't know that Hitachi actually makes Z280's. Z180 is based
on HD64180, but has some minor changes to make it more compatible
to the Z80-interrupt scheme (easy connection to Z80 peripherals).

Z80,000 was the processor I wanted to go with after my Z8001. But
as the years went by nothing showed up until at a local university
booth a Zilog-speaker said, that they had actually done some chips.
But they consumed too much power (NMOS, then) and they didn't know
if the NMOS-parts would ever get ready for the masses.

A while ago I read about two new developements, th Z16C00 and the
Z320. When I asked Zilog, they told me that Z16C00 is compatible
to Z8000 but CMOS. I don't have any data on it, maybe it uses
fewer clocks for some instructions.
Z320 was claimed to be their Z80,000 in CMOS, but I have no data
either. If it is Z80,000 as the 1984 tech. man. defines it, it
would be too slow to be useful.

They absolutely are still in business and still producing excellent software
(22DISK and 22NICE are just two products among many).  It's just that they
have moved to Oregon, and there are still lots of old copies of the
shareware around with the old address and phone number.  Here is the new
information:

        Data:   503-683-1385

I'm sending them $25 today for their AnaDisk program.  Stick a CP/M disk in
your machine and get a complete report on how it is set up: sides, sector
sizes, skew.  Look at any track or sector.  It's like the standard CP/M disk
utility programs except that it works with diskettes in just about any
format.  And it can make a duplicate of just about anything you throw its
way.  Sydex is definitely a company that deserves our support.

Hello & Greetings!

Well.... I now have my Kaypro II and Osbourne Executive up and running
 (Thanks to Don Maslin!) 

But I have a small question.

Is there a program out there which would let me use one (or both) of the  
above machines connected to my IBM PC via rs-232c possibly via modem to allow  
using the PC's harddrive for storage/retrieval?

----( begin dream here )------
What I wish is a program which would be transparent to the CPM Machine, and  
maybe run in the back ground (tsr) on the PC.
I guess I would settle for a good ftp program or something also.
----( end dream here )------

last question:

I've ftp'ed alot of files which I thought were text but when I looked at them
they look like they are compressed. All the files end in .azt for example:
cpm-cc07.azt
Could someone tell me how/what_to_use to extract them?

			Thanks,

I need some assistance from the Net on the following:

  I am looking for E-Mail replies from anyone that has any CBIS
  Network-OS boot ROMS for the TeleVideo RS-422 interface for IBM
  compatible computers.

  Anyone that has spare cards for TeleVideo's Remote Workstation
  Processor (RWP), otherwise known as the TS-800R... I need two cards,
  or as many as anyone can locate.

  Anyone who has worked with Network-OS and has discovered a method of
  connecting two TS-806's or TS-816's to transfer files via RS-422.

  Anyone that has ZMP working on the TeleVideo TS-803 or TS-803H.


Much thanks to all who reply!

Subject: public domain C application code?
Message-ID: <9208141514.AA06181@tmpcu.mdc.com>

The McDonnell Douglas Recreational Computer Club's CP/M SIG has recently
discovered the possible existance of public domain C application code in the
CPMUG collection.  Is it true that from about Volume 93 on, all the CPMUG
volumes are C application source code?

Any information on where these volumes can be located (either by mail from a
public domain software company or by FTP from a CP/M archive site) would be
most appreciated.

Just when we thought we had a complete archive library...

Thanks in advance for your help!

To use CP/M 2.2 on a Model III, you'll need a "Holmes Vid-80" board or its 
equivalent. "Holmes" has been out of business for a number of years, but 
someone may be willing to sell you the necessary hardware. If I remember 
correctly, "Holmes" also sold a version of CP/M 2.2 that worked with its 
hardware...  :)  Good Luck!

I need CP/M for TRS80 Model 4, and for a Cromemco Z-2 i think. I have a
8" DS/DD floppy that claims to be CP/M 2.2 for Cromemco, but there
doesnt seem to be much on the disk. Its the 64K version. At the very
least i need some way to download some of the CP/M software from 
wsmr-simtel20.army.mil into the Cromemco (i just repaired its power supply 
last night, and amazingly enough it works!). A little noisy, but it works...

If you are trying to do it at the RCA jack level, you can't.  (As
far as I know)  You have to actually tear the equipment apart,
and you will probably have to use a CGA monitor because it's
designed to be operated at NTSC scan rates.

Message-ID: <1992Aug17.092920.1@woods.ulowell.edu>

	I had hoped that this message would be a final one of thanks, 
to all the people who had given me various advice about my old Amstrad
word processor; the delay was due to the long time it took to obtain
the proper 3.5 disk drive.
	I hooked things up as instructed, and turned on the switch, only
to get absolutely nothing.  I have taken the beast even further apart than
it was before I tried adding the 2nd drive; still -- nothing.
	The trouble seems to be that the 5 volt output is about 3 volts,
and the 12 volt output is about 5; the 24 volts is ok.  There is no raster;
I suspect there is no high voltage on the CRT (I can't hear it); and the 
voltages there are something I do not like to even get near.
	So, on an outside chance, if anyone has access to the schematic
of the power supply-video board of an Amstrad, I will pay you to make
a copy.  I suspect that the diagram is basically the same for all models;
mine was a PCW8256 (or was it? I took all the stuff home from work).
	Also, maybe someone can answer this question.  In normal operation,
does the CRT require a signal coming back from the computer board before
it starts operating?  If so, can I trick it into operation?  (I am trying
to find out if the high voltage supply of the CRT is what is loading
down the power supply.)

	In fact the index of the CPM/C128 archived files have a number of

Also, since I downloaded these files into a GCR CBM formatted disk what do

Yes, I for one don't use Z-System for a couple of reasons.  First,
it takes away memory from an already memory starved system.  Second,
when it comes to my CPM based systems I'm cheap and I don't want to 
spend any more money on them. Finally,  I have Z3Plus but my 
CPM+ board on my Heath system went south so I'm back to using plain vanilla
CPM V2.2.  Maybe when I get the CPM+ board back in operation, I'll run
Z3Plus but until then I can't see investing in any more Z-System stuff.
Now don't get me wrong, when I used Z3Plus, I was very please with it.
It had some nice functions that I didn't find in any other operation system,
and the memory requirement on a Z3Plus system weren't outrageous.

Unfortunately, I'm being dragged into the PC world.  I've bought some neat 
pieces of software and I think knowing the PC world is not a bad idea. 
Like it or not, we may all have some sort of PC system sitting in our
houses. I still use my Z80 systems from time to time.  My son
enjoys banging on the keyboard and I still write some programs using
MODULA-2 but as far as spending any more money on my old system, I'm
pretty hard pressed to do so.

Yes, many of us know about the Z-system, but when you have converted
mostly to DOS and the CP/M systems exist only for solving problems
others are having or for bringing up non-working systems, there is
little to upgrade for.  I really do not want to learn a new interface
this late in the game.

dzc is a compressed DOC file (look for UNCR24 or later; handles xqx, xzx, etc),
aqm is compressed ASM file, rsx is CP/M 3.0 Resident EXtension file like DOS
TSR (I think), but I haven't previously seen irv and rsp files.

To move files from GCR to MFM disk, you can use the built in MFM formats for
IBM, Osborne, Kaypro and others or use M.Garamzhegy's J'ggler128 which 
allowed you to format/read/write many other CP/M MFM formats.  Or if you want
MS-DOS MFM, use DOSDISK.  Format the MFM disk first then COPY/PIP the file from
GCR to MFM.

I suggest the LIB files are probably LBR files.  You will need something
like LU or NULU to extract their members.  .?z? files are crunched.  Use
UNCRUNCH on them.  ?q? files are squeezed.  Use USQ on them.  Dunno about
the others.

I don't know about the C128 GCR -> MFM conversion but stay tuned.
Somebody here will tell you.  There is more than one C128 out there.

Before you can do anything else, you need a program that will run in C128
native mode, and will copy your CP/M files over to a CP/M disk.  There's
a program callled Crosslink (or Xlink) that will do this, although its
capabilities are limited.

Once you have Xlink, you should also get a program called RDCBM and transfer
it to a CP/M disk, along with the necessary utility to extract the files.
(You'll probably find it in the form of RDCBM21.LBR, which requires a
de-library utility, as well as an unsqueezer.)

RRDCBM will allow you to read those Commodore native GCR disks while you're
running CP/M, but it only works with a 1541 or 1571 drive.  If you have a
1581, you're out of luck.  Unless....!

Unless you have a 1750 or compatible (512K or larger) REU.  I have a program
called xfer2reu, which runs in 128 native mode, and will transfer files
from a Commodore disk to the CP/M ramdisk, formatting the ramdisk if
necessary.  So far as I know, it works with any CBM drive.  However, it 
only works with a 1750 or clone, not with 1700 (unless it's been upgraded
to 512K), and certainly not with QBB, RamLink, RamDrive, GeoRam, or any
other type of ram expansion.

XFER2REU is not entirely bug-free, so it's properly still in the beta-testing
stage.  However, it does work quite well most of the time for me.  I've
had some difficulties making it work properly for someone who has a very
early 128, so I can't guarantee it would work for you.

However, I'll be happy to email a uu-encoded copy of it to anyone who's
interested.  Please reply, if possible, to this address:

rholmes@athena.cs.uga.edu

I'll also respond to requests emailed to my bitnet addres, rholmes@uga,

There are programs for formating disks in MFM formats.  I haven't used them.

First, you need a 1571 for 5.25" disks.  Or, a 1581 for 3.5" disks.  The 1541
drive WON'T handle MFM disks.

There are serveral MFM formats built into CP/M on the C128.  There are also
programs for extending the list.  (I've never used them either.)  But once
you get or make an MFM disk, you can use PIP to transfer the files.

  Yup. Z80MU is a Z80-CP/M 2.2 emulator that seems to work quite well.
Shareware, but the registration fee is kind of steep .. $150.

I am trying this one more time, I hate to throw this stuff out or stick it
into parts bin in the garage.

I know there are still some Zorba (old CP/M) machine owners out there.
I have some spare parts for a Zorba, sold mine a few years ago, anyway I
would like to clean out the closet and get rid of some of this stuff, so
no reasonable offer will be refused.  Just please make some type of offer.

Zorba mother board.  Partially populated, fully socketed.
With schematics and documentation (whatever I had when I got my machine).

Canon 2/3 height drive for a Zorba.  Can be used in a P.C., works fine.

Power supply for the Zorba.

For those of you attached to your machines here are those spare parts to keep
them running for a few more years.  For hobbyists here are some parts to
mess around with.

I once tried to install ZCPR3 on my Apple CP/M system, but it clobbered the
patch(es) that allow me to make full use of my Rana Elite II drive (360K vs
140K on a normal Apple 5.25" drive).  The disk space is more important.  I do
know that NZCOM is supposed to install on the Apple, but would it support my
Rana drive?  If you can prove to me that it can utilize my drive, I would be
motivated to try it.

I just replaced the original 1100 mAH battery pack in my PX-8 with one rated
1600 mAH.  I figured the increased capacity would be quite useful.
Unfortunately, the new pack fails to fully charge, even when left charging
for up to 18 hours.  Have any other PX-8 owners experienced anything similar?
Also, does anyone know if the PX-8 needs to be modified to charge the batteries
at a higher rate?  I know that charge rate is related to capacity.

Try and unplugging the second drive and see if the supplies go back
to the proper values.  I suspect you are loading the supply.
Otherwise, look at the supply (I do not have one of these systems)
and see if there is a limiting resistor on the front end of the
swicher (close to the AC supply input) and look at its value.  You
can probably chop 20% off of the resistor value without hurting the
supply.  Any more and you  could be in trouble.

Good Luck...

If those modifications are callable by the BIOS with regular BIOS
calls, or if you can make use of them through the BDOS, I don't
think you should have any problems.  Believe me; I know from
whence I speak.  I started on an Apple, and I had to hack CP/M in
order to make it work properly with our full ASCII keyboard (I
have an Apple II Plus with a MicroSwitch keyboard which, unlike
the Rev 4-equipped keyboards, can do all 128 characters, but the
lower- and uppercase characters were reversed, i.e. I had to hit
shift to get lowercase and vice-versa.  The routine was called by
the BIOS and it works just beautifully with anything.).  It
worked in Microsoft's CP/M and it worked just as well in Applied
Engineering's CP/AM (which, incidentally, boots just fine on a
non-Applied Engineering Z80 card, SO LONG AS IT IS MICROSOFT
SOFTCARD (---NOT--- SOFTCARD //E) COMPATIBLE.  And if you can
find a copy of AE's CP/AM, USE IT!!!!  IT'S A GREAT SYSTEM!!!

Subject: Access to Internet through CP/M
Message-ID: <1684E87A2.IF29731@VM.CC.LATECH.EDU>

     I've just begun using the Internet from my DOS machine linked to my univer
sity's mainframe at work. I would like to also be able to use it from home.
My problem is that my home machine is a Kaypro IV CP/M. I'm sure that I co
uld dial up and connect through the built-in modem.However, once I connected,
 I would not have the opportunity to use the function-key operations, since the
 Kaypro does not have function keys.
Does anyone have any suggestions as to what I might do?

Paul,
 
  Having owned a PX-8, I understand your reasons for replacing the batteries.
I have also replaced them in my machine.  I was able to get them to a full
charge by letting them sit for over 20 hours.  They should charge to full,
just takes longer.  Leave them on charge till they get a bit warm.  Keep 
track of how long it took for them to warm up a bit.  That is the time you
DO NOT want to exceed.  If they are still not charged, then the RS-232 port
may be turned on.  It stays on until turned off.  If you run MEX and fail
to kill the 232 port, the Ni-Cads, never reach full charge, because almost
no software turnes off the port.  It's in the book somewhere, but alas,
I have sold mine else I would look it up for you.

I got Nevada Fortran for the DEC VT180 (Robin); it cost $30 US, 10 years ago,
which was (and still would be) a cheap price.
I believe Nevada has other languages, and that they were written for more
popular Z80 computers than the Robin.

Subject: WANTED: Bit shift method for XMODEM packet check sum.
Message-ID: <1992Aug30.195744.2256@leela.cs.orst.edu>

I'm looking for the bit shift method of obtaining the checksum used in the
XMODEM file transfer protocol.  I don't need any C or other high level
language code, and I already have the mathematical formula for obtaining
this sum but what I need is the fast way using registers in the 8088 CPU.


The reason I need this is that I'm trying to help out a friend with his BBS
system.  He does his own programming and since he is using an old XT for 
a server and it handles multiple calls simultaneously, the poor machine
gets bogged down computing the checksum in a high level language (I don't
recall what language he is using, but it was something really obscure which
had excellent string handling capabilities.  Anyway he says the ting to do
is to put some numbers into the CPU reginsters directly, do some quick
shifting of something, and then out pops the checksum.  This would speed up
the system quite a bit I understand.

So if you have the CPU register method of getting the XMODEM checksum please
email it to me.

Thank you very much,

Dean,

If you *really* meant "checksum," there is no algorithm - you simply
total the bytes of the packet and ignore the overflow, and the result
is the (8-bit) checksum.  But, nobody should be using "xmodem"
transfers with simple checksums; they should be using 16-bit CRCs at a
minimum.  (Idealy, they should be using the zmodem protocol with
32-bit CRCs.)

If you want to see how checksums and both types of CRCs are handled in
C, get a hold of a copy of the sources to RZ/SZ.  We have an anonymous
ftpable set in PD8:<MISC.ZMODEM> here.
