Subject: C compiler

I already wrote in this discussion several months ago that the 19.95$ MIX-C
compiler does all my CP/M work and that I never had any problems with it
including K&R compatibility.

Somebody just noted here that MIX doesn't advertise their CP/M products any
more. They do advertise their MS-DOS ones though, phone them and ask for the
CP/M stuff.
If they say they don't market it any more, ask them for the permission to
copy mine (free) and send me their written authorization. Out of the 400
pages manual (tutorial, C reference manual, l{rary, operations manual) I will
also Xerox the CP/M dependent part (special functions and operating instruc-
tions).

Subject: Kermit Archives

	I have been trying to unravel the directory PD2:<CPM.KERMIT> for
a friend who has an old Morrow Decisions CP/M machine.  I plan to get
him the HEX files and the DOCs.  

	However, when I "un-arc" CP409HEX.ARK.1, I find that a number of
the HEX files in that archive fail the parity check and that the
"un-arc-ing" terminates prematurely because a "File has an invalid
decode tree."  Although there are 61 files in the archive, I get only 38
of them because of this premature termination.

	I believe that my "un-arc-ing' procedure is valid, because it
unravels the DOC archive in the sme directory satisfactorily.

	Have any of you met this problem and solved it?  If so, how?

	Thanks,

Subject: Aztec C and register declarations

Another correspondent writes about Aztec C:

	"The set I bought came with library source, compilers for both
	Z80 and 8080 output (the big difference is the Z80 allows one
	extra "register" specification) ..."

That's two extra.  On the 8080, the first "register" goes in BC, the
rest in the stack frame.  On the Z80, the second and third "register"s
go in IX and IY.

Using BC is a win over statics, but IX and IY are not (it takes more
code to use them than it does to use static memory).  All three
registers give better code than automatics (stack frame elements).

In 1982 I did an extensive project in Aztec C, on a TRS-80 model II
running Pickles&Trout CP/M.  Five months of programming a "business
BASIC" compiler, for real-world money.  I was quite happy with the
Aztec C compiler.

Well, MANY years ago I used Toolworks C from SW Toolworks.  (Think
I still have it around somewhere...)  My memories of it are pretty
dim, but I seem to recall that it worked pretty well.  I had to
use it on a floppy system, so things were pretty slow compiling.
But, having used Microsoft C on an MessDoss system, I can say
that it was not as slow as MicroSoft C was.

But my test case was very tiny (one or two programs), and my
memory of the results VERY hazy.  Has no-one else used Toolworks C?

Subject: K10 disks, and reading on XT/AT

Well, I hate to have to post this update, but I figured I had better.

Forget all the stuff I told you about how K10 disks were drastically
different than K4 disks. (Kaypro 10, Kaypro 4, for those not up on
what was happening)

A very fine gentleman in Kansas by the name of Richard offered to 
attempt to read the K10 disk with various programs he had, including
22DISK.  Well, 22DISK had no problems reading the K10 disk.  22DISK 
is a shareware program which has a LARGE number of disk formats it can
read.  And you can configure it to read almost any format you can 
describe, according to the documentation.  (22DISK is on SIMTEL20 
somewhere)

Another person was able to read the K10 disk I sent him with (I believe)
Uniform.

My thanks to both of you, and my apologies for having such a terrible name
memory.  (BTW, Richard, I hope to get your disks back out in the mail
sometime this week.  Will email you when I do.)

	If you want to hack C for yourself under CP/M-80 C/80 is a good
	price/performance product for small floppy-based systems.
	It was reasonably K & R and had all the normal functions and
	was easy to port stuff into.  If you're a general hacker and
	program in a number of languages you should be pleased.  If
	you are an esoteric C hacker doing big-time C you should get out
	the bucks and spring for Aztec C.  C/80 didn't compile through
	a bunch of inordinate steps or take significantly longer than
	it should for what it was doing, so I was happy enough with it
	in the limited environments I was playing in.  I used Whitesmith's
	C for CP/M at the same shop and while it was robust I thought
	I'd go nuts going through all of the compiling and linking steps,
	waiting and waiting... it wasn't worth it for light-duty home
	hackery and cost too much.  Aztec C was best if you're going to
	spend significant amounts of time in C.  C/80 is fine for
	recreational C programming.

Anyone remember MEX.COM? It's a modem program that I like
quite a bit. Unfortunately, I last used it about three years ago
when CP/M worked on my Apple (I got a //gs, and found my CP/M
card wouldn't physically fit inside, so last night i got brave
with a hacksaw....), and had a different serial card, so now
I need a new overlay...
 
Does anyone have either a generic MEX overlay for a serial
interface and Hayes compatable 2400 baud modem OR a MEX
overlay for the Apple //gs modem port and a 2400 baud Hayes
compatable modem?
 
Thanks in advance.

Subject: CP/M Emulation

I  am  running  a CP/M emulator that I downloaded from the SIMTEL
archives.  It works well on most programs written  for  the  8080
cpu.   Every now an again however I get a error message that says
"BRANCH OUTSIDE ADDRESS SPACE" and I get dumped back to CP/M-86.

What does the error message mean?

What can I do to fix it

I think that since 8080 programs load at 100H while CP/M-86 loads
at  000H may be part of the problem.  If that's the caes, how can
I get the pgms to load at 000H.

If that's not the  problem,  does  anyone  know  how  It  can  be
corrected?
Many thank's in advance.

Keith,
   How about posting an address or phone number where we can order this
product? And maybe a price? I have used Z80MU for some time. I would have
been willing to pay for it, but the documentation specifically requested
no money. The new features you describe sound wonderfull, and I am willing
to buy the product sight-unseen, based on the quality of the existing free
version. Accessing SIMTEL is next to impossible for me, and to do so just
to download MU_DEMO to obtain a phone number seems counter productive, so
I, for one, would appreciate the address or phone #. Hmmmm..... You don't
suppose they have the same address/phone they did when Z80MU first came
out, do you? What a concept! Maybe I'll call that old number tomorrow...

SIMTEL-20 broadcasts the digest via e-mail, and you can have it
e-mailed to you by sending them mail at INFO-CPM-REQUEST@SIMTEL20.
ARMY.MIL.  However it sounds like you are already getting that

collection of custom-built hardware, but since it can easily have device
drivers added to it, and it does not use any memory management hardware,
it should be possible to port it to numerous computers that current use
the CP/M operating system.  The source code is written mostly in C,
and was compiled with The Code Works' Q/C compiler.  UZI's code was
written from scratch, and contains no AT&T code, so it is not subject
to any of AT&T's copyright or licensing restrictions.  Numerous 7th
Edition programs have been ported to UZI with little or no difficulty,
including the complete Bourne shell, ed, sed, dc, cpp, etc.


How it works:

Since there is no standard memory management hardware on 8080-family
computers, UZI uses "total swapping" to achieve multiprocessing.
This has two implications:  First, UZI requires a reasonably fast
hard disk.  Second, there is no point in running a different process
while a process is waiting for disk I/O.  This simplifies the design
of the block device drivers, since they do not have to be interrupt-based.

UZI itself occupies the upper 32K of memory, and the currently running
process occupies the lower 32K.   Since UZI currently barely fits in 32K,
a full 64K of RAM is necessary.

UZI does need some additional hardware support.  First, there must be
some sort of clock or timer that can provide a periodic interrupt.
Also, the current implementation uses an additional real-time clock
to get the time for file timestamps, etc.  The current TTY driver assumes
an interrupt-driven keyboard, which should exist on most systems.
The distribution contains code for hard and floppy disk drivers, but
since these were written for custom hardware, they are provided only
as templates to write new ones.


How UZI is different than real Unix:

UZI implements almost all of the 7th Edition functionality.
All file I/O, directories, mountable file systems, user and group IDs,
pipes, and applicable device I/O are supported.  Process control
(fork(), execve(), signal(), kill(), pause(), alarm(), and wait()) are fully
supported.  The number of processes is limited only by the swap space
available.  As mentioned above,  UZI implements Unix well enough to
run the Bourne shell in its full functionality.  The only changes made
to the shell's source code were to satisfy the limitations of the C compiler.

Here is a (possibly incomplete) list of missing features and limitations:

    The debugger- and profiler-related system calls do not exist.

    The old 6th edition seek() was implemented, instead of lseek().

    The supplied TTY driver is bare-bones.  It supports only one port,
    and most IOCTLs are not supported.

    Inode numbers are only 16-bit, so filesystems are 32 Meg or less.

    File dates are not in the standard format.  Instead they look like
    those used by MS-DOS.

    The 4.2BSD execve() was implemented.  Additional flavors of exec()
    are supported by the library.

    The format of the device driver switch table is unlike that of
    the 7th Edition.

    The necessary semaphores and locking mechanisms to implement 
    reentrant disk I/O are not there.  This would make it harder to
    implement interrupt-driven disk I/O without busy-waiting.


A Description of this Release:

Here is a list of the files supplied, and a brief description of each:


intro:		What you are reading

config.h:	Setup parameters, such as table sizes, and the device
		driver switch table.

unix.h:		All strcuture declarations, typedefs and defines.
		(Includes things like errno.h).

extern.h:	Declarations of all global variables and tables.

data.c:		Dummy to source extern.h and devine globals.

dispatch.c:	System call dispatch table.

scall1.c:	System calls, mostly file-related.

scall2.c:	Rest of system calls.

filesys.c:	Routines for managing file system.

process.c:	Routines for process management and context switching.
		Somewhat machine-dependent.

devio.c:	Generic I/O routines, including queue routines.

devtty.c:	Simple TTY driver, slightly-machine dependent.

devwd.c:	Hard disk driver.  Very machine-dependent.

devflop.c:	Floppy disk driver.  Very machine-dependent.

devmisc.c:	Simple device drivers, such as /dev/mem.

machdep.c:	Machine-dependent code, especially real-time-clock and
		interrupt handling code.

extras.c:	Procedures missing from the Q/C compiler's library.

filler.mac:	Dummy to make linker load UZI at correct address.

makeunix.sub:	CP/M SUBMIT file to compile everything.

loadunix.sub:	CP/M SUBMIT file to load everything.


Miscellaneous Notes:

UZI was compiled with the Code Works Q/C C compiler and the Microsoft
M80 assembler under the CP/M operating system, on the same hardware
it runs on.  Also used was a version of cpp ported to CP/M, since
the Q/C compiler does not handle macros with arguments.  However, there
are only a couple of these in the code, and they could easily be removed.

Because UZI occupies the upper 32K of memory, the standard L80 linker
could not be used to link it.  Instead, a homebrew L80 replacement linker
was used.  This generated a 64K-byte CP/M .COM file, which has the lower 
32K pruned by the CP/M PIP utility.  This is the reason for appearance
of the string "MOMBASSA" in filler.mac and loadunix.sub.

To boot UZI, a short CP/M program was run that reads in the UZI image,
copies it to the upper 32K of memory, and jumps to its start address.
Other CP/M programs were written to build, inspect, and check UZI filesystems
under CP/M.  These made it possible to have a root file system made before
starting up UZI.  If the demand exists, these programs can be included
in another release.


Running programs under UZI:

A number of 7th Edition, System V, and 4.2BSD programs were ported to
UZI.  Most notably, the Bourne shell and ed run fine under UZI.
In addition the 4.2BSD stdio library was also ported.  This, along
with the Code Works Q/C library and miscellaneous System V library 
functions, was used when porting programs.

Due to obvious legal reasons, the source or executables for most of these
programs cannot be released.  However, some kernel-dependent programs
such as ps and fsck were written from scratch and can be included in future
releases.  Also, a package was created that can be linked to CP/M .COM
files that will allow them to run under UZI.  This was used to get
the M80 assembler and L80 linker to run under UZI.  Cpp was also
ported to UZI.  However, it was not possible to fit the Q/C compiler
into 32K, so all programs (and UZI itself) were cross-compiled under CP/M.

The Minix operating system, written for PCs by Andrew Tanenbaum et al,
contains many programs that should compile and run under UZI.  Since
Minix is much less encumbered by licensing provisions than real Unix,
it would make sense to port Minix programs to UZI.  In fact, UZI itself
could be ported to the PC, and used as a replacement for the Minix kernel.

Subject: Computer Design Solutions Z280 S-100 board

I recently requested comments on HD64180 or Z280 boards to replace
a Z-80 CPU board in an S-100 system. I got a few responses but
there seems to be only one candidate, a Z280 S-100 bus single
board computer from a company called Computer Design Solutions
in Statesville, NC.

Their product sounds good - has all the features I want at a
reasonable price - but I don't know anything about the company
itself. I don't want to put down good money for vaporware from
a firm that might go out of business any day.

Has anyone had any experience with Computer Design Solutions
or know anything about there reliability ?

Since there doesn't seem to be a comp.sys.S-100, this seems to be the 
next best place to post this...

I've got a IMSAI S-100 box, with a Jade "BIG-Z" Z-80 CPU card, and a Jade
"Double-D" disk controller, rev. C.  I picked up a rev B card in surplus,
and it doesn't seem to work.  Before I go trying to borrow a good scope
and/or a logic analyzer (both would require calling in past favors) does
anybody know if the s/w I have on my rev C. will work, or do I have to start
hacking (again...) ?

Anyone know what mods need to be done to the IMSAI to allow it to run IEEE 696?

Lastly, there are times that I can't get the mess to boot.  If I pull the
extra boards out (Semidisk, Godbout Interfacer 4 (triple serial & Centronics))
to a bare minimum (CPU, 64k Godbout RAM 17, floppy controller) it boots ok.  I
can then shut it down, plug in the other cards, power it up, and reboot with
no problems.  Any ideas?

I have a Morrow "Switchboard" for sale, with docs.

I'm looking for docs / bios code fragments for the following:
     Compu-Time T102A calendar/clock card
     California Computer Systems 2805 calendar/clock/terminator card
         "          "        "   2720 multi-port paralell I/O card

     Macrotech "MAX" memory board (no part number visible)
     Mullen "TB1" extender/logic probe (what chips are used ie logic probe?)
Memory Merchant MM16K14 memory cards
Qume DT-8 drives

Any help would be appreciated.  I am trying to bring up two systems for local

I have the 'manual' for that card somewhere, and I remember that there were
some mods to change a rev B board to a rev C board.  Email me a good path,

All I can say is, I have never had that problem with my setup (64k ram board,
Big z, Jade DD disk, 8" SA850 drives, VDB (video display board), 3 ramdisk
boards from that digital place in Texas, and a 2P+S (or 4P+S?) 
serial/parallel board - i.e.  a pretty full system).  I assume that a
Semidisk is a ramdisk?  Is it battery backed up?  If so, and the backup
voltage is getting onto the bus somehow, that could make it not reset.
...I think.

Well, I am keeping my s100 partly because it is not worth selling it,
and partly because I have some nifty I/O boards I want to play with,
and partly because it is handy to have a spare computer around which has
3 serial ports and 2 parallel ports, and which has a low cost so you are
not as afraid of blowing it up!

From: Ralph Becker-Szendy RALPH AT UHHEPG
To:   B_INFOCPM
Subj: MEX Overlays and SCSI Implementations
Two questions:

I jost got MEX onto my machine (which is barely compatible to itself, and not
compatible to anything else under the sun). I understand from the MEX
documentation that one needs two overlays: one for the computer-hardware (which
essentially implements the IO), and one for the modem (which implements
commands for dialing, disconnecting and such). I already got the modem-overlays
for Hayes-compatible modems (called SM13 through SM16), so this part is taken
care of. But now I need the "hardware-overlay", and if possible I don't want to
write one myself (doesn't seem to be worth the effort). In the case of Kermit
there is a "generic" overlay which does all the IO via the BIOS entry points
for PUNcher/ReaDeR. Is there a MEX overlay which does exactly that, and could
therefore run on any cp/m hardware with an IOByte and full PUN/RDR support
(like mine)? Such an overlay (although not extremely efficient) would save me a
lot of time. And if there is no "generic" overlay, is there one which just uses
a Z80 SIO (so I only have to patch the SIOs port adress into the overlay? And
if both of these simple solutions don't exist, which  overlay (out of the ones
available via SIMTEL20) should I use as a template write my own (very simple)
overlay?

Part two is more of a hardware question, and does not REALLY belong on
INFO-CPM. I'll ask anyhow: I am comtemplating adding a hard-disk to my system.
There isn't anything on the market (no surprise in the case of a self-built
computer with a non-standard bus). I see two good options:

a. Buy an IBM/PC (8-bit bus, not AT) disk controller, and just adapt the bus
signals (and connectors, of course) to interface it to the Z80 bus. Obviously
I'd have to disable the PC BIOS ROM on the controller card, and I'd have to
find out the low-level commands for the disk controller. Advantage: real cheap.
Disadvantage: No DMA; and it's a kludge; and my machine may get AIDS from the
PC (aargh) hardware. Question: Does anyone have (good or bad) experiences with
using PC periphereals on a Z80 based system? Which controllers are good to use
(for example, well enough documented)?

b. Build my own SCSI controller. As far as I understand SCSI is
just a glorified parallel port and an interface definition. There are
(supposedly) dedicated SCSI controller chips. And one could add DMA (with the
Z80-DMA chip, or with the built-in DMAs in the Z280). Advantage: nice, clean
design. Can be made to be real fast (DMA). Can implement a real nice driver in
the BIOS. Can connect more than just disk drives to the SCSI bus (tape drives
and laser printers come to my mind). Disadvantage: Lots of work. SCSI disk
drives are more expensive. Again, who has experiences with this? Which
SCSI controller chips and disk drives are recommended?

I would be interested in the sources too. However, I suggest waiting a
bit because I think comp.sources.misc is moderated. It might just be
that the sources were mailed to the moderator, when they were supposedly
posted. (Since all this has happened just recently, the moderator maybe
hasn't got round to approving the sources yet)

Any (even contradicting) info on this is of course appreciated.

No help on Part I here, and Part II DOES belong in INFO-CPM!  Look in back
issues of MicroCornucopia --- say about March-April or May-June 1987.  Dave
Hardy devoted one of his last S-100 columns to plans for a wire-wrapped
HD interface for the S-100 buss.  He used a Western Digital generic con-
troller (can't remember the number, but I can get it for you if you want),
and the S-100 part was just a bi-directional parallel port to get data
and commands to and from the WD card.  The WD card can handle up to 2
ST-506 drives (you know, "IBM compatible") that are less costly than
SCSI, I think.  I was very interested in his design, but the one place
that advertised this generic WD controller wants about $180 for it.  That's
way too high when one can buy a PC controller for way less than half that!!
I wrote to him, and asked him about using a PC controller, and hacking it
around to work, but he never responded.  The generic WD card is *ONE* way
to go.  There is also a HD kit for the Z80 that apparently uses a little 
"daughter" board that plugs into the existing Z-80 socket.  This comes
with the WD generic controller and "software".  Definitely the "easy"
way to go, but not easy on the wallet -- $500 range.  I can get you
that address if you're interested.  Don't know if it uses DMA.  I might
be biased here, but I'd avoid dealing with SCSI if I could.  Too costly.
You can pick up an ST-506 drive (10-20M) for relatively little.  See if
you can find Dave's article.  It'll give you some ideas!!

Subject: GOCCP for PCPI

It's me again.
 
I have managed to scrounge an old copy of GOCCP.ASM, and a copy
of MAC to assemble it with. After some poking about, I found a
good way to stuff it into PCPI CP/M where it sits in 6502 space,
and that works just fine, but it requires me to have an AUTOST.COM
on all my boot disks to load GOCCP the first time.
 
Has anyone figured out how to patch the PCPICPM file with a new
CCP so that it can be relocatable by the INSTALL.COM program?

Sheesh, sometimes I wish I just had a SYSGEN.COM to play with....
 
BTW: For those that don't know, GOCCP is a CCP replacement that
changes 

A>

to

A0> (adds user number)

prints a list of files as it ERAses them
(good for when you use wildcard ERAses), looks for com files in
user 0 on the current disk if not found in current user area, then
looks on drive A, user 0, provides a GO command that simply jumps
into the TPA (0100H) after formatting the command line properly,
fixes a couple of bugs, and in general does a better job than the
"vanilla" CP/M but isn't as complicated as ZCPRx.
 
Anyone who wants the source, the .HEX for CCPs at 0DC00H, the source
and .HEX for my funny AUTOST.COM, or who wants to buy me a rolls
royce (:-}) can send mail.

Re: cost of SCSI

     SCSI is cheap, not expensive.  Most SCSI controllers are running
somewhere between $100-150 right now.  These speak the ST-506 interface
standard, so all you need is a standard drive on the other end.

     Total cost: about $300.  Not too bad, is it?  Especially since most SCSI
controllers can handle two drives of almost any size, while the PC
controllers limit the size of the drives you can put on them.

     Most people have the idea that SCSI is expensive just because it's
expensive on the Mac.  For quite a few people, the first time they heard of
SCSI was in connection with the Macintosh... and *everything* that goes with
the Mac is expensive!

Subject: Jade S-100

In INFO-CPM 88-248,  Mike Norris asks about a problem in which
his S-100 system fails to boot, but when he removes some "other
boards" it boots and then boots successfully after insert the
removed boards. This kind of behavior is symptomatic of bad
connections between one of the boards and the S-100 socket.

Try pulling all your boards, cleaning the sockets with spray
contact cleaner (use a good quality product designed for
electronic equipment), and claen the boards' edge connector
fingers by rubbing with a soft pencil eraser and then spray
them with the contact cleaner.

I have the same problem with my S-100 system but infrequently -
once every year or two. When this has happened, it has usually
been sufficient to pop the boards lose and re-seat them in the
connectors. I have gone to performing the cleaning process
as part of the annual preventive maintainance and haven't had
the problem for several years.

I have talked to a number on DEC service technicians who say
the second thing they do on service calls (after check the power
switch) is to reseat all the boards.

As I understand it, what happens is that there is some oxidation
off the metal surfaces of the contacts that builds up and acts
as an insulator. This happens even on the two surfaces of an
edge connector where they are in contact. Better immunity to
this kind of problem is one of the reasons that pin-in-socket
connectors like those used in the VME bus are popular in
industrial systems.

From: uop!mrapple@ucdavis.ucdavis.edu  (Nick Sayer)
Subject: GOCCP installed

Well...

I figured out how to patch the PCPICPM file to include GOCCP...
Anyone who wants a copy of PCPICPM (or STARCPM) with GOCCP installed
(and it even relocates properly with INSTALL.COM!) can send me
mail.
 
What I discovered is the map of the PCPI file. The addresses
below are the addresses when you load PCPICPM into the TPA
(most probably with DDT). If you want the file offsets, subtract
0100H from these addresses.
 
0100-01FF   Code for the boot sector (track 0, sector 0)
0200-09FF   CCP
0A00-17FF   BDOS
1800-20FF   BIOS
2100-30FF   6502 resident BIOS-type code
3100-311F   relocation bitmap for boot sector (0100-01FF)
3120-321F   relocation bitmap for CCP
3220-33DF   relocation bitmap for BDOS
33E0-34FF   relocation bitmap for BIOS
3500-36FF   relocation bitmap for 6502 resident BIOS-type code

Note that the relocation map size for a segment is the size of
the segment in question divided by 8. Normally, the relocation
maps for the boot code and 6502 code are all 0s.

Here's how you figure out what to put in the relocation maps.

First, assemble the code for the segment you want such that
it's ORG is that of a CP/M system with the CCP starting at 0DC00H.
Put this aside for now.

Next, assemble the code for the segment with the ORG 0100H higher than
it was last time.

Feed these two files into a PCPI utility called GENBMAP.COM (see
below). That will spit out a bitmap file. *** GENBMAP.COM HAS A
BUG IN IT THAT OUTPUTS ONE SECTOR TOO MANY! MAKE SURE THAT
THE BITMAP FILE IS THE RIGHT SIZE! ***

Load the bitmap and code into the PCPICPM file and save it.

-----

Now I'm sure you're wondering what GENBMAP.COM does. What it does
is do a byte by byte comparison between the two given files.
If the bytes are equal, it outputs a 0 bit. If they're not
equal, it outputs a 1 bit. These bits are collected in the
bitmap, such that there is a one-to-one match between the bits
in the bitmap and the bytes in the input files. The MSB of
byte 0 of the bit map is the first byte of the code, the
LSB of byte 0 of the bit map is the 8th byte of the code,
the MSB of byte 1 of the bit map is the 9th byte of the
code, etc.

Hope this is helpful and doesn't get me into trouble for
giving away state secrets :-).

BTW: Last time I heard, PCPI was no longer supporting their CP/M
boards. Can anyone substantiate? Is there a PCPI CP/M users group?
Would anyone like to start one?

Subject: MEX Overlays and SCSI Implementations

For using the z80 SIO, there are several variants , but
the zerox 820 source code should provide a guid. Variants
include the port addresses, whether the two port addresses
are interleaved or not, and how the data rate is set ( this
is external to the z80sio.

  For the scsi question, there are lots of scsi controller
  boards going on the surplus market for under $100, see
  Computer Surplus Store ads in BYTE or Computer Shopper.
  Surplus 10 megs drives are about $100. The port to talk
  to the SCSI drive is basically a bidirectional parallel
  port with several status lines. It is balanced by a
  resistor network to about 3 volts.
    The pc board approach is used by some tandy coco suppliers,
    and I know of at least one such arrangement for Heath Zenith
    H89's. The address lines for memory don't have to be selected,
    you can just address it via ports, but of course you have
    to write the software. The SASI or SCSI software is probably
    more generic.

Nick also commented that it "isn't as complicated as ZCPRx."  With the new
autoinstall Z-Systems (NZCOM for CP/M-2.2 computers and Z3PLUS for CP/M-Plus
computers), ZCPRx is no longer complicated.  In Nick's case, he would just
have to set up his system to run the command NZCOM on cold boot, and the Z-
System of his own design would come up automatically.
 
   NZCOM, together with the superb new DOS replacement ZSDOS/ZDDOS (with
integral datestamping, DOS search path, public file support, and dynamic
reconfiguration capabilities) is being used as the OEM operating system with
a new 64180-based Apple CP/M card soon to be announced.
 
   At long last, I have a facility for writing diskettes in Apple CP/M (Soft
Card) format, and thus the huge Z-System distribution packages no longer
have to be downloaded.

I did just this for my one-of-a-kind CPM system, and it has worked out
very well.  The SCSI Host Adapter is indeed a glorified parallel port,
and I built one from 6 or so TTL chips.  If you used one of those SCSI
controller chips, the design wuld probably be even simpler.

For a controller, there are several places to get SCSI-to-ST506 controller
cards.  I have one made by Shugart (before they went away).  There
are several others readily available, for about $80 or so.  I have
also had a SCSI tape drive hooked up to my system.  This was very easy to do.
I also use the same controller (I have two) on a PC with a PC host adapter.

If this approach sounds worthwhile to you (or anyone else), send me mail,
and I will tell you more.

Does anyone have any drivers for PCPI Apple CP/M?  I am especially
interested in drivers for:
     . AppleCat Modem

Subject: SCSI Implementations (adaptec manual)

I can reccomend the Adaptec ACB-4000(A) reference manual that you can
request with the board (which converts SCSI to ST-412/506 that those
cheap PClone drives want.  It describes EVERYTHING, and even has a
source listing for an 8085 (I think) driver in back.

On the disk side, there are easily-interfacable custom chips, like the NCR
5380, which has CMOS and high-performance variants.  There are lots of
things to worry about when building a SCSI interface, although if you only
plan to attach a single drive to a single computer then you can probably not 
worry about arbitration and other stuff.  These days, I'd go and build
a PClone backplane interface and buy the cheap cards for it.  (For example,
I think I saw a $49 SCSI interface in some random magazine the other day.)

As always, be careful about TERMPWR, this is where some SCSI devices 'miss'
obeying the SPEC.

Good luck.

I too have been waiting patiently, but there has not been much traffic in

I vote for posting it here, after all, this is where the Z-80 folks hang out.

Hey Nick,

        That's a very interesting piece of program you have, I'm very
much interested in it. By the way I've an Apple ][+ 64 K, 2 drives,
and uses a Softcard CP/M, which runs Apple CP/M 2.23.
What is the main difference between a PCPI and a Soft-card ? I assume
that the CP/M soft isn't the same. As I see you use PCPICPM.COM file
to install a CP/M image on disk and I use CPM60.COM .
But good news for you maybe is that I ones tried to install P2dos, a
replacement for BDOS, which I failed to install on an Apple, but then I
had a lot of responses of INFO-CPM readers who wanted to help me.
There was one program that was very useful, nl. SYSLOAD.COM from the
author of P2DOS, which basically could load the CP/M image into memory
(at a save place, where exactly I cann't remember for the moment --) I've
to check this one -- ) and afterwards save it again to disk. On the
other hand I used therfore DDT for the same purposes.
If you want more information about this please ask me, and in the meanwhile
I'll refresh my memory about that subject.
OK
Gratien D'haese

P.S.: P2DOS is still not working on an Apple.

been quite a lot of PCPI discussion via info-cpm from time to time, and I have

up a separate user/interest group for PCPI, I would support it, but I would

Which is another good reason not to use them.  There are several good
PD linkers which handle either case, although assemblers in general
do not.  Seven character globals are the limit if you want to stick
with true .REL format; if not (like SLR), then you can have 16 chars.

There are two systems on the market for adding hard drives to a

requiring any SCSI card at the other end.

The other is by Emerald Microware which does SASI for $50 including s/w,
requiring a Western Digital card at the other end.

I have one of the Ampro and three of the Emerald as well as a
home-brew SCSI.  All work fine.

I did the same thing using my Xerox 820-II parallel port to talk to
a SCSI board (Shugart SA1610).  This one did not require any chips, just
cabling.  Unfortunately, the cabling is point-to-point to transform Xerox
parallel ports into SCSI; also, you can only operate one SCSI card.  However,
that is enough to run two hard drives.

It was a bear to get the timing right.  The -I was too slow for writing, but
fine for reading which screwed me up for awhile.  I also tried an Omti card
with the same results.  -II, or -I with speedup, is fast enough to keep up
on these two cards at least.

Subject: North Star Woes

I'm the lucky owner of a really nifty-swifty 64K 2-floppy North
Star Horizon, acquired second-hand with virtually no
documentation.  It runs North Star CP.M 2.2.  Anyways, I've been
downloading lots of CP/M PD stuff from SIMTEL20 and local BBSes,
but recently much of it doesn't work.  I use a strange setup to
acquire the programs, so that may be at fault...  I use my Amiga
1000 as my download and BBS-hopping computer (among other things)
and then upload from the Amiga to the North Star using a 9600BPS
null-modem hookup.  I use a good, reliable comm program on the
Amiga, and MEX v 114 on the North Star.  The XMODEM transfers
from Amiga to NS all work just fine.  (XMODEM CRC, of course)
Anyways, when I go to use the un-LBR'd COM files, the North Star
just gronks the primary (logged-in) drive for a few seconds and
then reports             NO SPACE 
    Neat, eh?  I thought the problem was some BIOS modifications
I made, but the problem persists even when I boot from a nearly-
virgin system disk (free of my hacking).

So, I'm open to suggestions.  Should I try re-shipping the files
to the NS?  Look at possible hardware problems?  Pray to whatever
formless demons control CP/M bugs?

The zero byte is NOT always zero; it indicates the record type of this
line of hex code.  The last line of a HEX file is usually:

	:00xxyy01

where xxyy is the starting address for example, although I have seen other
meanings for it.  The 01 indicates this is the last record.

Checksum is computed by taking the sum of all bytes on the line (the colon is
ignored) and inverting it.  In other words, if you sum all bytes on the
line including the checksum, the result should be an 8-bit zero (ignore any
carry beyond 8-bits).

I have seem some implementations which, for some reason, ignore the count
byte (1st one) in computing the checksum.  Don't know how that happened,
but that method is wrong.

If You look into the May/June 1986 issues of BYTE (that was the time
BYTE was still readable), You'll find in Steve Ciarcia's column
a two-part article on
	"Adding SCSI to the SB180 Computer"
This gives You
a) a fairly good introducation into SCSI
b) a hardware description of the SCSI controller on the SB180/SB180FX.
The design uses the NCR 53C80 which uses a chip count of 1 (one)
plus a couple of terminating resistors, though it calls on the HD64180's
on-chip-DMA.

(I must admit, I own an SB180FX with the SCSI I/F but have not been
able to get it running yet 8-( )

Subject: Mystery North Star problems solved!

Well, gang, I figured out the problems which plagued my North Star Horizon.
In an earlier post, I sent out a plea for help with my 64K North Star, running
NS CP/M 2.2.
	Anyways, the answer was:
		I had 16K of RAM addressed incorrectly.
The 64K is in 4 16K boards.  One of the boards, the 16K at 08000h, had
its address switches set wrong.  (Bloody gremlins!)  I really don't recall
touching the switches, but fiddling around inside it's possible to do nearly
any adjustment by accident!

	The missing 16K, where everybody thought 16K oughta be, caused lots
of problems which would only manifest themselves in programs or data that 
needed that bank.  Hence, the sporadic nature of the bug.  (Gosh! To think
that the machine could limp, let alone run well most of the time, with one-
fourth of its memory absent...amazing!)

I am not an expert on Apple CP/M, but it is my understanding that a great
many people have quite successfully installed all kinds of replacement
operating system components.  I know for a fact that this is true of the
Apple PCPI system.
 
No one has yet informed me of any Apple CP/M board on which our new NZ-COM
(for CP/M-2.2) and Z3PLUS (for CP/M-Plus) versions of Z-System do not run
(and there are a good number of Apple customers).  They install
automatically, so anyone with an Apple CP/M computer should be able to use
them, even if they do not know anything about the intricacies of the
operating system.  There is no need to assemble or patch anything; they run
like an application program.  Most of the NZ-COM configuration is
accomplished with a menu program.  The finer points in NZ-COM and all the
customization (if needed) in Z3PLUS are handled by editing a simple text
file.
 
NZ-COM already includes the ZRDOS replacement disk operating system and the
ZCPR34 command processor replacement.  ZSDOS/ZDDOS, spectacular new DOS
replacements that are about to be released (manuals are at the printer now),
can also be installed into an NZ-COM system (or even a CP/M system).  They
bring the DOS functionality to a level corresponding to ZCPR3.  Features are
run-time configurable.  DateStamping has been designed in.  With ZDDOS it is
handled completely within the DOS; ZSDOS requires a small external module. 
The date stamping can be either Plu*Perfect style or CP/M-Plus (P2DOS) style
OR BOTH SIMULTANEOUSLY!  Plu*Perfect style public files are supported, and
ZSDOS even has a DOS search path like the command search path of ZCPR3. 
Access modes (read-only or read/write) to files located indirectly are
controlled dynamically using the utility ZSCONFIG.  Automatic disk logging,
of course!  Excellent error messages that report not only the nature of the
error but the name of the file involved, if any.
 
So, there is no reason for Apple CP/M users not to take advantage of the
advanced CP/M-compatible operating systems.

That wonderful, verbose NO SPACE message is printed by the CP/M
program loader when it runs out of TPA for an executable.  In other
words, you don't have enough RAM to run whatever programs you are
trying to run.

As I recall, the North Star didn't use the standard memory
organization for CP/M (TPA started at 0x100, CCP/BDOS/BIOS at top of
memory is the standard).  If your arrangement is different, you will
have to relocate the binaries before they will run in a different
configuration.

[In response to several requests here is the latest SIMTEL20 archive blurb]

                     THE SIMTEL20 ARCHIVES

OVERVIEW

There is a collossal amount of free public domain software for the
CP/M, PCDOS/MSDOS and UNIX operating systems, and for the DoD standard
programming language, Ada, in several archives on WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL,
a DECsystem-20 running the TOPS-20 operating system at White Sands
Missile Range.  Archives of correspondence for several newsgroups,
including INFO-CPM, are also available.

You can obtain these files using the InterNet file transfer protocol,
FTP (described in a following paragraph), with user-name "anonymous".
For a login password, use your host-name or any other string of
printing characters.  Throughout this message, FTP examples are given
in a GENERIC syntax.  You will have to consult either local
documentation or your friendly system wizard to learn the actual
syntax used with your local mainframe operating system.  For the sake
of brevity, the full host name "WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL" will be
dropped from further references to SIMTEL20 in this discussion.

To obtain directory listings, connect to SIMTEL20 via FTP and do this:

  get pd2:<cpm>cpm.crclst
  get pd2:<cpmug>cpmug.crclst
  get pd2:<sigm>sigm.crclst
  get pd1:<msdos>msdos.crclst
  get pd1:<pc-blue>pc-blue.crclst
  get pd1:<misc>misc.crclst
  get pd2:<unix-c>unix-c.crclst
  get pd2:<ada>ada.crclst

The <CPM> and <MSDOS> archives are the ones to watch for the very
latest CP/M and MSDOS offerings, as they are updated frequently.  The
<CPMUG>, <SIGM> and <PC-BLUE> archives contain software distributed by
the CP/M Users Group, the SIG/M Users Group and the PC-Blue Users
Group respectively.  This software is available on diskettes from the
associated users groups, and the archives are updated as new volumes
are issued.  The <PC-BLUE> archive contains software for the IBM-PC
and similar machines.  Some runs under CP/M, and some under
PCDOS/MSDOS.  The <MSDOS> archive also contains software for the MSDOS
and PCDOS operating systems; but this archive is locally managed, and
therefore is updated more frequently than the <PC-BLUE> archive.  The
<UNIX-C> archive contains a variety of UNIX tools.  Those which apply
specifically to CP/M are in the directory <UNIX-C.CPM>.  The <ADA>
archive is growing rapidly. Information about this archive is in
directory PD2:<ADA.GENERAL>.  In general, the archived software is
very good, having been worked-over and refined by many users.  The
documentation and comments tend to be complete and informative.  Files
in all of these archives can be obtained using the FTP procedures
described in this message.

PLEASE NOTE: Due to the large number of files available, the archive
maintainers cannot possibly attempt to validate the proper operation of
the various programs.  When a program bug is reported, immediate action
is taken to either correct the error or remove the offending program
from the archives.  Still, users must understand that all archive
programs are offered AS IS, and the archive maintainers specifically
disclaim any liability should these programs malfunction or cause
damage, incidental or otherwise.  When testing ANY new software, be
certain that all information stored on disk is backed-up before you
start, so that you can recover if files are damaged or erased.  This is
particularly true if you have a hard disk, in which case malfunctions
can be spectacularly disasterous.

FILE TYPES

Files are stored in two formats: Text files such as those with names
that end with DOC, HEX, INF and ASM are sometimes stored as ASCII
files, but usually these files are stored in binary squeezed form.
Binary storage is also used for executable (COM) and library files.
Squeezed and library files are described below.  All binary data are
stored as four 8-bit bytes per 36-bit SIMTEL20 word, with the low-order
four bits of each word filled with zeros.  If such a file is
interpreted as a contiguous string, as will happen if a straight binary
transfer is made to a 16 or 32-bit UNIX machine, the four zero filler-
bits per 36-bit group will cause rather bizarre and frustrating
results.  The methods for dealing with this situation, which differ
from machine to machine, are explained in a following paragraph.

Squeezed and crunched files have been compressed using programs
available in directory <CPM.SQUSQ> to obtain a significant size
reduction.  Squeezed files can be identified by the letter Q in the
second letter of the extension field.  For example, the file
PD2:<CPM.ASMUTL>RMACPAT.AQM is a squeezed file.  It must be
transferred as a binary file, and then unsqueezed.  The unsqueezing
can be done on a CP/M system using USQ-xx.COM (where "xx" is the
current version) from directory <CPM.SQUSQ>, or there are several
host-based unsqueezers in the <CPM> and <UNIX-C> archives (see for
example, directories <MISC.TOPS-20> and <UNIX-C.CPM>).  Files with
the letter Z as the second letter of the extension field are crunched.
Uncrunch programs can be found in the same directories as the
unsqueezer programs.

CP/M library and archive files (those with names ending in LBR and ARK)
combine several regular CP/M files into a single BINARY file which
contains an internal directory of its contents.  LBRs are created using
the CP/M library utility LU310.COM or some other compatible utility.
The complete packages for LU310 and a newer compatible program called
NULUxx (where "xx" is the version) can be found in directory
PD2:<CPM.ARC-LBR>.  C-language source code for compatible UNIX
utilities for System V and Berkeley versions of UNIX are in directory
PD2:<UNIX-C.ARC-PROGS>.

For more information on ARC, ARK, LBR, squeezed and crunched files,
get PD2:<CPM>-FILES.DOC and/or PD1:<MSDOS>-FILES.DOC.

Although the type of storage used for a particular file can usually be
inferred from the file-name, this is not always true.  It is a good
idea to check the appropriate "crclst" file to ascertain the storage
format used for each file of interest.  Now, and for the foreseeable
future, storage formats for files in the <SIGM>, <CPMUG> and <PC-BLUE>
archives can be determined from their "generation numbers", as shown by
the FTP directory command.  For example, the FTP command:

  dir pd1:<pc-blue.vol001>

will yield results of the form:

  -CATALOG.001.2
  ABSTRACT.001.2
  BW.ASM.2
  BW.BAS.1
  BW.EXE.1
  COLOR.ASM.2
  COLOR.BAS.1
  COLOR.EXE.1
  ...and so on

All files with names ending in ".1" are stored in binary format, and
those with names ending in ".2" are stored in ASCII.  This relationship
will continue to apply for files in the <SIGM>, <CPMUG> and <PC-BLUE>
archives until further notice.

WARNING: Because the public domain archives on SIMTEL20 consume a huge
amount of disk space, storage capacity will be conserved by the
greatest practical use of libraries, archives, crunched and squeezed
files, all of which are stored in binary format.  If you cannot
properly transfer binary files, you are going to be VERY FRUSTRATED!
If you need help, please contact your local system wizard and provide
him/her with a copy of this message.  Having done that, if you are
still unable to make things work correctly, send a message to
INFO-CPM-REQUEST@WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL and I will try to help you.
Please provide the following information:

 1. Machine and operating system  (e.g., VAX-11/780, 4.2 BSD UNIX)
 2. Network software in use  (e.g., 3-Com UNET)
 3. Complete list of available FTP commands  (e.g., GET, PUT, etc.)

Important files in the <CPMUG> and <PC-BLUE> archives are the
CATALOG files. These files, which are stored in ASCII, contain the
"-CATALOG.nnn" files from all the volumes of their respective archives.
To obtain these composite catalog files, connect to SIMTEL20 via FTP
and do this:

  get pd2:<cpmug>cpmug.cat
  get pd1:<pc-blue.vol000>pcblue.cat

Similar files exist for the <SIGM> archive, but they are stored in
squeezed form.  These files, when unsqueezed, yields SIG0.CAT and
SIG1.CAT (the catalog).  They can be obtained using the FTP command:

  get pd2:<sigm.vol000>sig0.cqt
  get pd2:<sigm.vol000>sig1.cqt

(NOTE: That's "L-and-three-zeros" in "vol000")

FILE TRANSFER VIA FTP

FTP stands for File Transfer Protocol, a formalized procedure for
moving files among machines on the Defense Data Network (DDN) and other
networks that connect with the DDN.  The protocol is implemented by a
program often called FTP.  The different mainframe operating systems
implement FTP with variations in command syntax.  Some systems have the
remote-file-name precede the local-file-name in the command.  Others
reverse this order.  Some versions have the whole command on a single
input line, while others use multiple lines.  Read the documentation
for your local system, or consult a friendly system wizard for the
details of your local FTP command syntax.

UNIX users can do something like "man ftp" for on-line instructions.
However, not all UNIX FTP programs are called "ftp", so you may have
to snoop around in the system directories or ask a system wizard for
the correct local name to use with the "man" command.  ITS users can
do ":INFO FTP", and "HELP FTP" works on TOPS-20 and some other
operating systems.  I will be happy to update this message with
pointers to other sources of on-line documentation if they are sent
to INFO-CPM-REQUEST@WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL.

FTP transfers from SIMTEL20 can be made with user-name "anonymous".
Use GUEST for the password.  For anonymous logins, SIMTEL20 supports
the FTP "change working directory" command.  (Your local syntax may
be something like CD, or CWD).  Ignore the message which may appear
that prompts you to enter a password.  This command allows you to
specify a default SIMTEL20 directory to be used for all file
retrievals, and thereby relieves you from having to repeatedly type
"pdx:<whatever>" as part of each filename.  For example, you can do
something like this:

  cd pd2:<cpm.goodstuff>
  get filename-1
  get filename-2
  ...and so on

instead of using the longer filename forms shown in previous examples.

Users of TOPS-10, TENEX, TOPS-20 or ITS systems can use "image" or
"paged" mode for ALL transfers.  UNIX users must use "ascii" mode for
ASCII files, and "type tenex" or "type L 8" mode for binary files.
MULTICS users can use "ascii" mode for ASCII files, but binary files
require special treatment that is best described by the following
example provided by Paul Schauble <Schauble@mit-multics.arpa>:

 !ftp simtel20
  220 WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL FTP Server Process 5Z(14)-7 at [date/time]

  user_ftp:  !login anonymous
  331 ANONYMOUS user ok, send real ident as password.
  Password:  !guest

  user_ftp:  !quote "type l 8" <--(NOTE: That's lowercase "L" 8.)
  200 Type L bytesize 8 ok.

  user_ftp:  !get micro:<cpm.zcpr3>alias.hlp alias.hlp
  150 Retrieve of MICRO:<CPM.ZCPR3>ALIAS.HLP.1 started.
  226 Transfer completed.
  Total elapsed time:  35.7 seconds.
  4348 bytes transferred in 18.5 seconds (1850 bits/sec).

  user_ftp:  !quit
  221 QUIT command received. Goodbye.

Lines beginning with "!" are typed by the terminal user. The received
files are stored on MULTICS with one 8-bit byte per 9-bit word, and can
be transferred to a microcomputer with Kermit (described in a
following paragraph).

All aspects of the FTP process for UNIX machines have been automated
to a high degree by a program in directory PD2:<UNIX-C.CPM>. With this
program, a simple command like "mb modm700.com" can connect to
SIMTEL20 and transfer the binary file "modm700.com" from directory
PD2:<CPM.MODEM7> to a local file also named "modm700.com", all with no
user intervention.  Batch command files containing multiple lines of
the form in the above example can be run in no-hangup background mode
to transfer whole directories without the user even remaining
logged-in on his local system.  For more information, get the file
PD2:<UNIX-C.CPM>AUTOFTP-DOC.TXT.

PROGRAMS FOR TRANSFERRING FILES AMONG MAINFRAMES AND MICROS

Christensen Protocol Mainframe Programs:

For a micro to reliably exchange files with a mainframe, cooperating
file transfer programs with automatic error detection and
retransmission of faulty blocks must be running on both computers. One
such family of programs uses a popular protocol created by Ward
Christensen and enhanced by others.  Directory PD2:<UNIX-C.XYZMODEM>
contains several programs, XMODEM, UC and the older UMODEM (all
written in C), which implement this protocol on UNIX machines.  See
the file PD2:<UNIX-C>UNIX-C.CRCLST for a list of other useful UNIX
utilities.

On ITS machines, file transfer using the Christensen protocol can be
done using MMODEM (type :MMODEM for instructions), or LMODEM.
Documentation for LMODEM is in file .INFO.;LMODEM HELP. Other useful
ITS utilities include:

 TYPE8  - types an ASCII file stored in ITS binary format.
 TYPESQ - types an ITS binary format "squeezed" file (see the first
          paragraph under FILE TYPES).
 USQ    - creates an unsqueezed version of a squeezed file.
 HEXIFY - creates an Intel hex format file from an ITS binary format
          COM file.
 COMIFY - creates a COM file from an Intel hex file.
 CRC    - computes the Cyclic Redundancy Check value for a file, using
          the same algorithm that is used by the CP/M program CRCK.

Brief instructions for any of these utilities except LMODEM can be
obtained by typing ":utility_name" (for example, :CRC).

The ITS utilities listed above are also available for use with TOPS-20,
but since ITS binary format is no longer being used for the SIMTEL20
archives, these utilities have been converted to work with TOPS-20
binary formats.  A collection of TOPS-20 utilities for transferring and
manipulating files can be found in directory PD1:<MISC.TOPS-20>.  See
PD1:<MISC>MISC.CRCLST for a list of available programs.

File transfer and conversion utilities for use with VAX/VMS machines
are contained in directory PD1:<MISC.VAXVMS>.  See MISC.CRCLST for
details.

Christensen Protocol Microcomputer Programs:

An excellent program for transferring files between micros, or between
micros and mainframes is called MODM700.  This program, often referred
to as MODEM7 (the name of its easier to pronounce ancestor), uses the
popular Christensen protocol to transfer files with automatic error
detection and retransmission of erroneous blocks.

To get started with MODM700, you should first FTP and examine the "DOC"
and "MSG" files from the binary library file PD2:<CPM.MODEM7>MODM700.LBR.
The "DOC" and "MSG" files are actually stored in the library in
squeezed form, so you will have to perform three steps to get them:

   1. FTP the binary library file.
   2. Extract the elements having filename extensions of "DQC" and
      "MQG". If you have no facilities for doing this on your
      mainframe host (see the earlier comments on mainframe-based
      library utilities), then you will have to transfer the library
      to a microcomputer and extract the necessary elements there.
      If this requirement seems to put you in a "Catch-22" situation
      because you have no facilities for mainframe-to-microcomputer
      transfers, there is a way out; read the "Getting Started"
      section which follows.

   3. Use an "unsqueezer" (described above) to convert the "DQC" and
      "MQG" files extracted from the library into "DOC" and "MSG"
      files. As in the case of the library extractions, unsqueezing
      can be done on either a mainfrome host or a microcomputer,
      depending on your circumstances.

Together, these files will tell you just about all there is to know
about getting MODM700 to run on your machine. Take the time to read
them; they're quite informative.  You will also get some helpful
insights from reading some of the overlay files. These overlays,
described in file PD2:<CPM.MODEM7>M7OVL-yy.LST, are used to customize
MODM700 for particular machines without having to edit and assemble
the huge MODM700 source file.  Complete instructions for performing
this procedure are contained in each overlay file.  The letters "yy"
in the above filename should be replaced with two digits giving the
current version number as determined from CPM.CRCLST.

And then, there is MEX. MEX stands for "modem executive", and it is
just what the name implies, a communications and file-transfer
program with a built-in mini operating system that runs under CP/M.
This program can do file transfers using either the Christensen or
Compuserve protocol, and it has an enormous potential for highly
automated operations because it can read and execute command-scripts
pre-stored in disk files.  These scripts can include sending
commands to a remote computer, as if they had been sent manually
from the microcomputer in terminal-mode.  Users of this relatively
new program are still exploring its possibilities.  For more
information, look in CPM.CRCLST under the heading "PD2:<CPM.MEX>",
and then get the various files that have "DQC" and "IQF" in their
names.  These DOCumentation and INFormation files are stored in
squeezed form (note the "Q" in the filename extensions), so you will
have to unsqueeze them.  Overlays for MODM700 will also work with
MEX, but they will not provide all of the extended MEX features.

Kermit:

Another excellent program for transferring files is called KERMIT. This
program has the advantage of being available for an impressively large
number of mainframes and micros. It is, for example, available for the
IBM-PC, and it DOES NOT require CP/M.

To get started with KERMIT, connect to CUNIXC.CC.COLUMBIA.EDU using
FTP, and do this:

  login anonymous
  user guest    (or answer guest if it asks for a password)
  cd ker
  get readme.doc

Note that this file is NOT on SIMTEL20, and the name is subject to
change.  If you cannot find a file with this name, snoop around in the
first half-dozen or so files in the alphabetical listing obtainable
using the FTP directory command:

  dir

You should find something useful.

  Questions can be addressed to INFO-KERMIT-REQUEST@CUNIXC.CC.COLUMBIA.EDU.

Getting Started:

In order to get MODM700, MEX or KERMIT running on your micro, you must
first transfer the necessary files from mainframe to micro. If you
already have a receive-to-disk communications program of some sort, you
can use it to move the needed files.  In the long-run it is essential
to be able to transfer 8-bit binary files, but initially it is not
absolutely necessary.  Some of the files are quite large.  For example,
MODM700.COM is over 18K bytes, and the HEX file (which you will need if
you can't transfer 8-bit files) is over 45K.  Moving large files to
your micro without using an error detecting protocol can result in
frustrating errors, but it can be done by receiving multiple copies and
using manual or machine-assisted comparisons to locate and repair bad
parts of the code.  However, there IS a better way.

Directory PD2:<CPM.STARTER-KIT> contains a short starter-program called
PIPMODEM.ASM that can be FTPed to your mainframe, printed, and then
entered into your microcomputer by hand and assembled.  This can then
be used to down-load either MBOOT3.ASM or BMODEM.BAS (depending on
whether you prefer assembly language or BASIC), both of which can
receive files using the error detecting Christensen protocol.  Once you
have this capability, you can download the full-function file transfer
program of your choice.  To examine this option, connect to SIMTEL20
via FTP and do this:

  get pd2:<cpm.starter-kit>pipmodem.asm
  get pd2:<cpm.starter-kit>pipmodem.doc
  get pd2:<cpm.starter-kit>mboot3.asm
  get pd2:<cpm.starter-kit>bmodem.bas
  get pd2:<cpm.starter-kit>bmodem.doc

All are ASCII files.  Read PIPMODEM.DOC first, then look at MBOOT3.ASM
and BMODEM.DOC.  PIPMODEM.DOC explains the situation very nicely.
Questions concerning these programs should be sent to
INFO-CPM@WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL (NOT to INFO-CPM-REQUEST).

NEWSGROUP CORRESPONDENCE ARCHIVES

Copies of correspondence for several newsgroups are kept on SIMTEL20
in directories with names of the form PD2:<ARCHIVES.KEYWORD>, where
"KEYWORD" has been chosen to indicate the associated newsgroup. At
present, the following correspondence archives are available:

     newsgroup        mail archive filename
  ---------------     ---------------------
  ADA-SW              PD2:<ARCHIVES.ADA-SW>
  AMETHYST-USERS      PD2:<ARCHIVES.AMETHYST>
  INFO-68K            PD2:<ARCHIVES.68K>
  INFO-APPLE          PD2:<ARCHIVES.APPLE>
  INFO-CPM            PD2:<ARCHIVES.CPM>
  INFO-FORTH          PD2:<ARCHIVES.FORTH>
  INFO-HAMS           PD2:<ARCHIVES.HAMS>
  INFO-MICRO          PD2:<ARCHIVES.MICRO>
  INFO-XMODEM         PD2:<ARCHIVES.XMODEM>
  INFO-MODEMXX        PD2:<ARCHIVES.MODEMXX>
  INFO-MODULA-2       PD2:<ARCHIVES.MODULA-2>
  NORTHSTAR-USERS     PD2:<ARCHIVES.NORTHSTAR>
  PACKET-RADIO        PD2:<ARCHIVES.PACKET>
  INFO-PASCAL         PD2:<ARCHIVES.PASCAL>
  UNIX-SW             PD2:<ARCHIVES.UNIX-SW>
  INFO-XENIX310       PD2:<ARCHIVES.XENIX310>

Descriptions of these and other newsgroups can be obtained via FTP with
anonymous login (as for SIMTEL20) from the Network Information Center's
host SRI-NIC.ARPA.  Ask for the file PS:<NETINFO>INTEREST-GROUPS.TXT
(an ASCII file).  And please note, this is NOT on SIMTEL20.

File names for SIMTEL20 newsgroup correspondence archives have two
forms. For example, PD2:<ARCHIVES.CPM>CPM.ARCHIV.ymmdd is a group of
files containing INFO-CPM correspondence going back several years. The
characters "ymmdd" in the file names are actually digits giving the
year, month and day of the last message in each particular file.  Current
correspondence is kept in the file PD2:<ARCHIVES.CPM>CPM-ARCHIV.TXT, which
is constantly changing. Although INFO-CPM has been used as an example
here, the same naming scheme is used for the other newsgroup files as
well.  For a complete list of available files, connect to SIMTEL20 via
FTP and do this:

  dir PD2:<ARchives>

You will receive a list of names of the form:

  KEYWORD.DIRECTORY.n

where "n" is one or more digits.  For example, the INFO-CPM listing
currently appears as "CPM.DIRECTORY.1"  To then get a list of files in
a particular archive, do this:

  dir PD2:<ARchives.keyword>

where "keyword" (for example, "cpm") is chosen from the preceding list,
and the word "directory" and the number "n" are not used.  At present,
all of these files are stored in ASCII.

Subject: More up-to-date info on the server at RPICICGE.BITNET

The following is a more up-to-date collection of information about
using the server at RPICICGE.BITNET (aka VM.ECS.RPI.EDU).  Two notes
first, though: For non-Bitnet users connectivity continues to be a
problem.  The server uses the From: header in mail messages to derive
the return path, and it does this without the aid of a domain name
server.  Hosts not in the SRI hosts tables are typically unreachable.
Also, there have been some performance problems with the gateway
between Arpanet and Nysernet (where VM.ECS.RPI.EDU is to be found).
The ability of the server to satisfy file requests has been hampered.

RPICICGE File Server Documentation and Usage Notes

The RPICICGE File Server gives users on Bitnet hosts nearly up-to-date
access to the collossal public domain software collection stored on
WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL.  The server runs on an IBM VM/SP system and is
built on top of popular mail/file server, Revised LISTSERV.  However,
since the server handles files directly from WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL,
the normal VM/SP and LISTSERV concepts do not apply.

     WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL is a DEC Tops-20 system, and file naming
therefore follow Tops-20 conventions.  For this server, file names
always conform , to the following layout:

     diskname:<directoryname.subdirectoryname>filename.extension

The diskname identifies the physical disk device where the file is
stored.  The software archives are all kept on the disk named PD.
The directoryname identifies in which archive the file is stored.
The server provides access to the following archives:

     CPM     -- Info-CPM software archives.
     MSDOS   -- Info-IBMPC software archives.
     SIGM    -- SIG/M software archives.
     PC-BLUE -- PC-Blue software archives.
     MISC    -- Miscellaneous software archives.

The subdirectorynames partitions the archive into categories, and the
categories vary from archive to archive.  The filename is generally
some descriptive name for the file; the extentionname indicates its
type.  For example,

     PD1:<MSDOS.STARTER>UUDECODE.BAS

is a BASIC source program that does uudecoding.  It is located in the
STARTER (for starter-kit) subdirectory of the MSDOS archive.  When
requesting files from the server you must specify the file's fully
qualified name using the Tops-20 notation.

(Note:  The design of the server does not allow for getting files
at the top level directory, e.g. PD2:<CPM>CPM.CRCLST is not available.
However, since the files at the top level are generally directory
listings, the need for them is superceded by the /PDDIR command.)

Requests are sent to LISTSERV@RPICICGE.BITNET either as RFC822-style
mail, or as interactive messages.  Two commands are supported by the
server.  The /PDDIR command requests a directory of available files,
and the /PDDIR command requests a specific file.

*********************
The /PDDIR command. *
*********************
The /PDDIR command is used to list the names of files that match some
pattern.  The command has several forms.  They are:

    /PDDIR
    /PDDIR  PD1:<directory>
    /PDDIR  PD1:<directory.subdirectory>filename.ext  age

The first form lists the names of all the archives known to the server.
At present these are CPM, SIGM, PC-BLUE, MSDOS, and MISC.  The second
form lists the names of all the subdirectories in a particular archive.
(The directory name must be one of the known archives: CPM, SIGM, etc.)
The third form lists the names of files in the archive.  The age
parameter limits how old a file in the archive may be and still be
considered.  If omitted, the default is 30, meaning 30 days old.
The directory name must be one of CPM, SIGM, PC-BLUE, MSDOS, or MISC.
The subdirectory, filename, and ext may include asterisks ('*') as
"wild-card" characters.  The following are examples.

    /PDDIR PD1:<MSDOS>  --Lists all subdirectories in the MSDOS archive.
    /PDDIR PD2:<SIGM.*>*.*   --Lists files added in the last 30 days.
    /PDDIR PD1:<MISC.VAXVMS>*.* 9999 --Lists VAX/VMS related files.
    /PDDIR PD2:<CPM>UUDECODE*.* 9999 --Lists uudecode software for CP/M.

*********************
The /PDDIR command. *
*********************
The /PDGET command is used to request specific files.  No pattern-
matching is allowed.  The syntax for this command is as follows:

    /PDGET  format  simtel.filename   ( encoding

The format specifies how the file is to be transmitted.  Allowed
values are NETDATA, PUNCH, and MAIL.

    NETDATA  -- suitable for transfer to Bitnet hosts that can accept
                files in IBM Netdata format.
    PUNCH    -- suitable for transfer to Bitnet hosts that can accept
                files but cannot decode the Netdata format.  Files
                are sent as 80-byte card-images.
    MAIL     -- suitable for transfer to hosts that can accept only
                mail or are accessible to Bitnet only through gateways.
                Large files sent via mail are split into several
                smaller files that the recipient must reassemble.

If the format is omitted, NETDATA is assumed for Bitnet hosts and MAIL
for all others.

The encoding specifies any special translation for the file data:

    ASIS     -- suitable for hosts that can receive binary data.  The
                file is sent exactly as it is stored on the server:
                binary images of the file data.  ASIS may be used
                only with format NETDATA.
    UUENCODE -- suitable for hosts that cannot receive binary data.
                The file is sent uuencoded.
    TRANSLATE -- suitable for any host, but only when the file actually
                represents readable text.  The file is translated to
                EBCDIC.  (If you are on an ASCII machine, then your
                system should automatically translate to ASCII when
                the file arrives.) TRANSLATE applied to a binary file
                will yield trash.

If no encoding is specified, then ASIS is assumed for NETDATA, and
UUENCODE for the others.

*** Note:  Users on non-IBM hosts should remember that with the
           NETDATA/ASIS server defaults, binary data is put on an
           EBCDIC network (viz. Bitnet).  The normal action of most
           non-IBM networking software is to do EBCDIC/ASCII trans-
           lation on incoming data.  This will render most files
           from the server useless.  Non-IBM users should either
           use one of the other encoding options or receive the
           a file without translation.  (Jnet has this capability.)

In each of the following examples the user wants the UUDECODE.HEX and
the UNARC16.ARK file to download to a CP/M micro.

(1)  The user is on an IBM host directly connected to Bitnet:
          /PDGET  NETDATA  PD2:<CPM.STARTER-KIT>UUDECODE.HEX (TRANSLATE
          /PDGET  NETDATA  PD2:<CPM.ARC-LBR>UNARC16.ARK

(2)  The user is on a non-IBM host directly connected to Bitnet and can
     receive Netdata files, but not binary:
          /PDGET  NETDATA  PD2:<CPM.STARTER-KIT>UUDECODE.HEX (TRANSLATE
          /PDGET  NETDATA  PD2:<CPM.ARC-LBR>UNARC16.ARK  (UUE

(3)  The user is on some host somewhere:
          /PDGET  MAIL  PD2:<CPM.STARTER-KIT>UUDECODE.HEX (TRANSLATE
          /PDGET  MAIL  PD2:<CPM.ARC-LBR>UNARC16.ARK  (UUE

*********************
Additional remarks: *
*********************
(1)  If the server is unable to satisfy a request for a file from
     Simtel20 in three days, the request is rejected.

(2)  The server limits /PDGET and /PDDIR request by number and by size.
     The limits are adjusted periodically to regulate network load.

(3)  The server refreshes its directory listings of files at Simtel20
     about every two days.  Therefore, there is a window during which
     requests for recently deleted files are accepted by the server
     and requests for recently added files are rejected.

(4)  The server is EXPERIMENTAL.  It is supported on an as-time-is-
     available, best-efforts basis.

(5)  The primary mission of the server is to support the Info-CPM
     community on Bitnet.  General availability will continue as
     long as that mission is not compromised, and as long as disk
     space, system load, and network load are not a problem.

(6)  Problems regarding the service should be sent directly to
     FISHER@RPICICGE, and not to anyone at Simtel20 or its associated
     interest groups.

Subject: extremely cheap single-board comput

Well, they aren't what You would call "extremely cheap (n <= $30)",
but have You looked at the Single Board Computers/Controllers
Steve Ciarcia (from BYTE and CCInk) designed?

They might just be what You are looking for, but the price tag is
a little higher than the one You mention:

BCC11 Z8 based, BASIC/Forth programmable	$139.00
BCC52 8052 based, BASIC programmable		$189.00
BCC180 64180 based, BASIC programmable		$395.00
You can add opto-isolated I/O to be on the safe side:
BCC40D 8-Ch opto isolated I/O			$139.00
BCC40R 8-Ch Relay output board			$169.00

Question is if You are able to get anything in the $30.00 range!

I've built the BCC11 and the BCC52 myself and they are real fun!
(They were described in BYTE some time ago: BCC11: BYTE July/August 1981,
BCC52, BCC180 I forgot)
Their main advantage is, they're programmable in BASIC (I would prefer
C or PASCAL, but BASIC's what You get)
You can also escape to assembly language for the time-critical stuff.

Subject: Format of .REL files

I have posted this before on a different newsgroup, have received an
e-mail-response, but have lost it.
So here I go again:

What is the format of the (Microsoft?) .REL files that the assembler
generates?
All I have found out is that they seem to be bit-packed, i.e. they
consist of fields that are more or less any number of bits in size.

My foremost aim is to write a UN*X nm(1)-style utility  for my
Z-System (Steve Ciarcia's SB180FX), which is CP/M2.2 compatible.

Subject: Accessing SIMTEL20 files from Europe

The BITNET server at RPICICGE is no longer accessible from European
sites, but instead there are serveral 'sub-servers' spread throughout
Europe, which offer the same service on BITNET.

Below is the original Help file from these European TRICKLE servers.

======================== Begin of RED Help file ===========================

               RED - Listserv Redirector
               (C)1988 Turgut Kalfaoglu


What is RED?
  RED provides the SIMTEL20  files, and directory listings, with its
  own cache, where it keeps  its most recently requested files. It
  reduces the network load by providing the cache, and by providing
  directory listings  locally, instead of through  a distant list
  server.. It is a machine  (process) that runs disconnected from a
  terminal.

  Currently, the four sites that run this  software are called:

  In Denmark:   TRICKLE@DKTC11
  In Turkey:    TRICKLE@TREARN
  In Italy:     TRICKLE@IMIPOLI
  In Belgium:   TRICKLE@BANUFS11

  You are urged  to use the one that is  closer to your location.

  In this  tutorial, we will  be using 'TELL TRICKLE  AT TREARN',
  but  this  can  be  replaced  with  'TELL  TRICKLE  AT  DKTC11'
  or 'TELL TRICKLE AT IMIPOLI'.

  We also will use the 'TELL' command to send a single line message.
  It should be replaced with whatever is appropriate for your system.
  (Like XMIT , SEND, etc.)

How does it work?
  It provides faster file delivery than LISTSERV@RPICICGE because it
  holds the most recently requested files, and it also asks its peers,
  to find out if any of them has the file.

  It has two major commands.  /PDDIR and /PDGET..  As the names
  indicate, /PDDIR provides the names of the files, and /PDGET
  delivers files.

How to use /PDDIR:
  On IBM/VM systems, you can get a list of the 'major directory' names
  by simply typing this command:

           TELL TRICKLE AT TREARN /PDDIR
  RED should now send you a list of the major directory names.  Now,
  you can obtain a list of the sub-directories of any of the displayed
  names by putting the name between less-than and greater-than
  symbols..  For example,

           TELL TRICKLE AT TREARN /PDDIR <MSDOS>

  RED will mail you a file containing the names of the
  sub-directories.  Once you choose a subdirectory to examine, type in
  the main directory name, a period, then the name of the subdirectory
  name.  For example, if you chose SYSUTL sub-directory of MSDOS, then
  you may type this:

           TELL TRICKLE AT TREARN /PDDIR <MSDOS.SYSUTL>

  RED will first notify you of the number of files found, then will go
  ahead and mail you this list..  Once you choose your file(s) to
  order, then read on..

How to use the /PDGET command:
  Once you have a filename in hand, then tell RED to send you this
  file by providing it with the full directory name, and the
  filename..  If you wish to order a game called MADMAX.ARC that
  resides in the <MSDOS.GAMES> directory, then you may type in this
  command:

      TELL TRICKLE AT TREARN /PDGET <MSDOS.GAMES>MADMAX.ARC

  naturally, the above is only an example, and the file may or may not
  be present if you send the above command.

Receiving your file in a different format:

  Normally, SIMTEL files are sent AS-IS, meaning, ASCII.  If you would
  like to receive your file in a different format, you may want to
  append any of the below to the end of your command:

  (EBC80 Converts the file to 80-Column EBCDIC format
  (EBC32 Converts the file to 132-Column EBCDIC format
  (UUE uuencodes the file
  (OLD Sends the file using DISK DUMP or PUNCH format
  (SF Supresses BITSEND, and forces SENDFILE to be used for the
  transfer.
  (MAIL Forces results to be sent via MAILER.  (This is the default
  for MAIL command files)

  You may also wish to combine several options together.  For example,
  to receive a directory listing in PUNCH format, and UUEncoded,
   TELL TRICKLE AT TREARN /PDDIR <MSDOS.C> (OLD UUE

  To receive a file in in EBCDIC format, you may enter a command that
  looks like this:

   TELL TRICKLE AT TREARN /PDGET <MSDOS.GAMES>MADMAX.ARC (EBC80


Other commands:
   /NEWS  sends you our 2-page newsletter.
   /STAT  provides you the statistics of usage.
   /HELP  sends you this file.
   /IMDAT  sends   the  Turkish  version  of   this  help  file.
   /CAC Sends  you a list  of the files  that are stored  on its
         disk right  now. These files  can be sent  faster than
         the other files.
   /OPS   displays the RED operators
   /QUO Shows  you the RED's quota,  and how much of  that quotait
         has  used.  Once  RED  exceeds its  quota,  it  cannot
         order files,  until it receives some  of the requested
         files.
   /SUB <dirnam>
        Allows  you  to  subscribe to  a  directory.  Whenever
        a  new listing  comes in,  RED  will send  you a  file
        containing the names of the new files.
   /UNSUB <dirnam> is to stop RED from sending you the new files
        listings. Please issue this command  if you will not use
        the server anymore.
   /NEW <dirnam> nnn
        This command, displays the files that have arrived within
        'nnn' days, in the 'dirnam' directory.  If 'nnn' is
        omitted, it defaults to the last time you issued this
        command, for that directory.  If you are issuing this
        command for the first time, then it simply looks for
        files that are at most a month old.
   /POLL forces RED to check its peer servers

Priviledged commands:
  (This is a subset of the actual RED administrator's command list)
  /STOP will stop RED's activity
  /OFFLINE Stops REDs interpretation of files and commands.
  /ONLINE   puts the server back online.
  /SEND fn ft TO  userid AT nodeid Sends a local  file to a user
  /RDR forces RED to examine its reader, and process those files.
  /QRDR displays RED's reader

Delay Periods:
  If the file that you requested already exists in the cache
  directory, then you may expect to receive your file within a few
  minutes..  However, the system that RED is running is often slowed
  down by the other processes that are running.  This negatively
  affects the response time of RED.  If the file requested does not
  existin the cache directory, then RED will have to order this file
  from its list server..  If this is the case, the response time of
  RED is dependent upon the list server.  RED will give up waiting for
  a file after five to twelve days after its request.

Sending files to RED:

  RED now accepts command files in either MAIL or NOTE format.  Use
  NOTE or MAIL utilities to prepare your command file.  The files may
  contain any number of instructions, one per line.  Note that RED
  will abort processing a file if it detects an invalid command within
  the file.  RED does not necessarily mail back command requests - it
  may use single-line messages, when it is more appropriate to do so.

How to DONATE files to Simtel Archives:

  Files that you receive from here are sent from another network
  called ArpaNet.  The person-in-charge for the programs can be
  contacted at: W8SDZ@WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL.  Since it's another network,
  you will need to use MAIL to send the message.  He urges that you talk
  to him before you send in the file, so that he can check where it
  should be put, if it already exists, etc.  After getting his
  approval, you need to UUENCODE your file (perhaps using PDUTIL),
  then MAIL it to him.

Format of the files that comes with /PDGET command:

  RED will  send the files in  a NETDATA format, -unless  you use
  the  (OLD option-.  These files  can be  LOOKed, and  RECEIVEd.
  Note  that  PEEK  command   will  not  display  NETDATA  format
  properly.  However, since  most files  are in  ASCII, it  is of
  little use to LOOK at them.

  The files will mostly be either in Binary format, in ASCII format,
  or in EBCDIC format.  The binary files are recognized by the
  '.BIN','.EXE', '.COM ', '.ARC', '.LBR' suffix in their names.  These
  files are machine-specific.The files that are in ASCII format can be
  converted to EBCDIC (so that they can be used on an IBM system) by
  running a conversion program called PDUTIL.  If your installation
  does not have either of these files, Either I, or the
  LISTSERV@RPICICGE can provide it.  Simply say:
       TELL LISTSERV AT RPICICGE GET PDUTIL PACKAGE

The .ARC format:
  ARC is a special compression method that provides substential
  reduction on file size.  There are one or more files contained
  within an .ARC archive.  In order to extract the files from an
  archive, you will need a utility called ARC or PKXARC.These are
  available from <MSDOS.ARC-LBR> directory.  The actual file names of
  these files vary, but you may
  try:  TELL TRICKLE  AT  TREARN /PDGET  <MSDOS.ARC-LBR>PK361.EXE
  or:  TELL TRICKLE  AT  TREARN /PDGET  <MSDOS.ARC-LBR>ARC512.EXE
  If these attempts fail, it will probably mean that the file version
  has changed, and so has the file name.  You may wish to try
       TELL TRICKLE AT TREARN /PDDIR <MSDOS.ARC-LBR>
  and guess the new name of these files.

  Once you receive either ARC or PKXARC and an .ARC file, transmit
  them to your personal computer and issue the following command:

  ARC X <filename.arc>
    or
  PKUNPACK <filename>

  There is also a second utility called ARCUTIL, which runs on the VM
  systems, and extracts files.  It also provides ASCII to EBCDIC
  conversion of the extracted files.  To request ARCUTIL, enter:
     TELL  TRICKLE  AT   TREARN  /PDGET  <MISC.IBM-VM>ARCUTIL.LBR

  The directories of SIMTEL change often.  So, the above files may or
  may not be in the same directories as I have indicated.  So you may
  have to do some searching to find them..  A good place to check
  would be the <MSDOS.STARTER> directory, where additional help, and
  the mentioned archive managers can be found.

How to use the BITSEND/BITRCV:

  From now on, RED is sending its files in a special format called
  BITSEND - Unless you include the (SF option while issuing your
  command.

  In this format, the files that are sent are broken into smaller
  pieces, if the entire file is too big to be sent.  (Too big: over
  300K Bytes)

  If the file you request is over 300K, then the server will first
  send you a file called <fn> BITCTRL - this is the control file,
  where BITSEND has written the protocol used, the number of pieces
  that make up that file, etc.

  ( Important:)
  ( You  should NOT  'RECEIVE' any  files that  have BITCTRL  or)
  ( just numbers as filetype| )


  If you wait a little longer, the rest of the file will arrive, the
  filename will be the same as the <fn> BITCTRL file, but the filetype
  will consist of just numbers.  Once you have all the pieces that
  make up that file, you can then issue the BITRCV command.  You must
  also specify the 'spool ID' of the file that has BITCTRL as
  filetype.  From RDRList, you can simply type BITRCV in front of the
  file that has BITCTRL as filetype.

  If you get back an error message, saying "UNKNOWN CP/CMS COMMAND" it
  simply states that your installation does not have the BITRCV
  program.  Contact your network manager/system operator.

  Note: BITRCV EXEC can be obtained from your country NETSERV as well.
  Simply send "GET BITRCV EXEC" to your NETSERV.

  (VAX users:)
  (There is also an identical file for your installation, however,)
  (it is called 'BITRCV COM', and can be obtained from a NETSERV. )

  If you get back an error saying that not all of the file is in the
  reader, it simply means that you have to wait a little longer for
  the rest of the file to arrive.

Looking for a few good computer centers...

  That would be interested in running a copy of RED.  When you run a
  copy of RED, you increase the power of the whole file serving
  network.  Since each RED is aware of each other's existence, they
  will inquire each other about the requested files, and the users
  will enjoy a fast service, if any of the participating REDs has that
  file.  Since they inquire each other about the files in their
  caches, there are no multiple copies of a file on different REDs.
  Your RED will automatically get its directories, (and sometimes its
  source code) by its designated parent every couple of days.


  You will need:
  * VM/CMS 3 or higher
  * 15, 3375 cylinders (minimum)
  * Rexx Interpreter

  Please get in touch with TURGUT@TREARN if you would like to learn
  more about running a RED.

========================== End of RED Help file ===========================

Some additional remarks:

There are meanwhile at least two more servers:
TRICKLE @ AWIWUW11 (Vienna, Austria)
TRICKLE @ DB0FUB11 (Berlin, Germany)

Each of these servers is responsible for a certain region of Europe, and
if you try another one, it normally tells you to use the correct one.
One added exception is meanwhile: If a server has a requested file
already in its local cache, is sends the file directly. It answers also
to the command /CACHE, so you can find out what files are currently
present there.

This works very fine, but if you want to order a file, which is not yet
in any cache directory, it can take very long, resp. doesn't work at
all. All the servers seem to have a long list of outstanding files that
they don't get over from the States.

So you are not very lucky, if you are just interested in one particular
file and it is not yet there, but you can always browse the local
directories for interesting files, which are then sent very fast.

One last remark: The server programs are not always online, so it is
normally better to send them files or mail instead of interactive
messages.

To put it all together: I think the idea of the whole thing is very
good, but the actual results could still be improved. Perhaps it would
help, if more European sites participated in the service, as the primary
bottleneck seems to be the heavily used intercontinental line between
America and Europe.

After sending Mike Morris a note about my Big-Z board (which turns out

of the notes you have fix a big glitch in one of the I/O lines, then I
would sure be interested in any way I could get a copy of them (or a

Actually, the Northstar Horizon with Northstar cp/m is 'standard' in the
sense the the TPA does start at the customary 0x100, and generic cp/m
binaries will run as in any other system.  A possible problem (this may
be what is refered to in the cited article) is that the Northstar boot
load prom is at 0xe800, which limits the size of the TPA, and, in the
standard Horizon, the prom is not 'phantomed' out.

Northstar cp/m came with a utility (CPMGEN) which enabled one to select
the address(s) at which the various operating system segments ran.  Most
systems with 64k memory and the 0xe800 prom were configured like this:

	tpa		0x0100 - 0xd1ff
	ccp		0xd200 - 0xd9ff
	bdos		0xda00 - 0xe7ff
	prom		0xe800 - 0xefff
	bios		0xf000 - 0xfcff
   (or)	bios		0xf300 - 0xffff

An alternate boot load prom located at 0xfc00 was available for a time
from Northstar, as were various homebrew versions.  Many Northstars used
by hacker types were so equiped.

Note: John L. Schuncke, Jr - if you read this, mail to you bounced.  E-mail

I add my vote to it.  I just purchased a Macintosh Plus, because the parts
for my Kaypro are getting harder and harder to find in my area (and the
drives are starting to talk among themselves of revolutions ... ), but
damned if I'm going to give up my "fastest Wordstar(tm) in the west"

[Christmas hack time again!]

I have heard of many hd interfaces for z80 cpm systems in comp.os.cpm recently,
and was wondering if anyone had added one to a commodore 128.  (2Mhz z80 with
cp/m 3.00)

The best configuration I can think of is a drop in interface (i.e. plugs into
z80 socket) that hooks up to a st412/506 or SCSI drive.  

If anyone knows of a beastie like this,  I'd like to hear from you - try to 
get an address or phone number for ordering your specific beastie.

I would look carefully at the SIG/M diskette listings; they supported CP/M-86
at one point.  I have a copy of the old RESOURCE 8080 disassembler (Ward C.'s)
and a modified version written to disassemble Z80 code, both in source code

or you could try the Royal Oak BBS.

I mentioned before that I have an Epson Geneva with a broken PF-10 drive.
I have received a couple of offers for it as is, but none with which I'm 
happy (fair enough-it's busted).  So I thought I'd try something else.  
What I really need is a CP/M box with a disk drive so I can run my

WANTED:	A portable CP/M computer, preferably Osborne Executive or Vixen, 
	preferably with some version of Wordstar, but it must have a disk
	format accessible from Media Master and standard stuff.  Must have

WILL TRADE: An Epson Geneva laptop (PX-8) rig.  Has standard Geneva stuff
	(64k ram, serial port, 8x80 lcd screen, built-in microcassette 
	drive, portable Wordstar, Calc, and Scheduler, as well as MBASIC,
	on ROM chips [2 slots]); also has multi-unit with 64k ramdisk, 
	300 baud modem, and one extra ROM slot; portable printer (looks

Ya bet there is!

If You look at the CP/M disk directory entry format:

uu   ff ii ll ee nn aa mm ee ee xx tt   ee 00 00 nn
||   |				    |   ||       ||
||   ^-- filename.ext --------------^   ||       ^^-- file size in sectors

^^-- user area number or
  -- 0e5h if erased

aa aa aa aa  aa aa aa aa  aa aa aa aa  aa aa aa aa
|						 |
^-- allocation group numbers --------------------^

Note: The only difference between an unused and a used entry is the
user area field value.
If the file is erased, it is e5, if not, it is 0 <= uu <= 15 (or so).
(Of course, You must somehow take the free blocks into account)

There are a number of (PD) programs floating around that do the desired
unerasing.
BEWARE: You must not do anything after having ERAsed the files.

I have one, if You want to, I'll send it to You.
Send me Your e-mail address!
