The readers many of us depend on to read messages to info-micro

in the text that the subject has been seen and it is
almost impossible to understand what the message is about.

If you have a couple seconds, add the subject in the text.

	I am contemplating buying the Kaypro II but have not been very
impressed with the terminal emulator/modem software they want to sell
me. I can live happily with the public domain MODEMX.X stuff but wonder
about public domain terminal emulators? I need something that will
emulate VT52, VT100, H19 and/or ADM3a at 1200 or 2400 baud. I could hack
something up but would hate to reinvent the wheel.
	Also, does anyone have any feel if it's worth waiting a few
months for the Kaypro 10 (with hard disk for $1k over Kaypro II price)
or just as good to go with the II now?
	Thanks-

Kim,
	In reference to you message of 1 Apr 83 re: Kaypro II terminal emulator, I would
wait around for the KAYPRO 10, if that was my only choice of computer.  You might cgeck
into the Access Computer, which has the following:

Hardware:
		64K RAM  8K eprom
		7 inch CRT w/ 24x80 lines of text
		2 double sided double density 5 1/4 inch disk drives (320 KB ea.)
		Built in acoustic coupler [300 bps]
		Built in direct connect modem [not sure, but I think 300/1200 baud]
		2 RS-232 ports, 61-9600 baud
		1 centronics port
		1 IEEE 488 port
		Selectric type keyboard
Software:
		CP/M
		MBASIC
		CBASIC
		Perfict Writer/speller/file/calc
	And a communications package that emulated H19, VT100, VT52, and something called
a 'TH6800', whatever that is...  
	If you want to get more info, write them at:
		Access Matrix Corporation
		2159 Bering Drive
		San Jose, CA  95131
or call;

Frank,
	The way the computer reads disks is comtrolled by the disk controller.
In the KAYPRO, the disk controller is unable to read anything not written on a KAYPRO,
so you would have to change the hardware, not the software to be able to read other
disk formats.  The Osborne Double Density option allows one to read other disk formats
because the drive controller ROM has the instructions on how to do this..  If the
Kaypro has an EPROM in the disk controller, you might be able to re-
program it, but It would be very difficult to do so.  The easiest
way to do file transfer would be to have an Ozzie or PC hard-wired to each other
and send files through the ports.

I suppose I wasn't clear (I know I wasn't). The reader I was referring
to is BBoard or identical, it is the same on at least 10 hosts I use,
and it has the same problem on most of the hosts the gripes are now
coming from. There appears to be no problem if messages are sent via
sndmsg, but Hermes and most other mail systems do not provide a
message that reflects a subject field in BBoard type readers.

So, no big deal. If your message provides a needed service, all
interested will seek out the subject; if you are requesting info,
your chances of a response are reduced.

No point in screaming.

Kim,
	I haven't seenit because it has not been fully marketed.  Some computer
stores have demos in, but thats about it.  I call around about it and I talked
to a few friends and here is what I found:

	The Access will cost around $2400 - $2500
	It will have 64K of RAM + 8K of EPROM
	It will run CP/M 80 [3.0 when it comes out]
	It will have the modems as I said, though I still don't know about the baud
	It will have an 80 column printer with graphics, I think it is a 
Prowriter striped down and built into the Access's case
	And it will have an 80x24 AMBER CRT.
	
	The keyboard is VT100 type low-profile with all the special function keys, ESC, CTL, DEL,
etc...
	2 RS232 ports, 1 Centronics, and one IEEE 488 port finish up the package.  The disk drives
are as I said, 5 1/4, DD DS.  and an option to add an 8 inch drive externially...

	That all I have on it for now...  Check back with me in a few days for more, or I'll
let you know..

	Thanks for responding ref. my quest to find a true VMS version of
MODEM to run on a VAX 11/780. I have since obtained a copy of UMODEM
and we are adapting it to run on the VAX we run UNIX on; additionally, we
do have UNICE running on our VMS based VAX, and that could be an interim
solution. Despite my probings of various implementors, I still have not found
the elusive version that was described in Bill Westfield's MODEM commentary.
My department is interested in both a UNIX and VMS version, and we would
like to add features to support a 1200 Baud autodialer we have. I did hear
from/about one in-progress implementation, so maybe I should just be patient
Thanks for you response

   I assume most of you, like I, read the INFO files while
under HERMES, so, I would also assume that many of you have also
found a way the problem of being unable to issue a CTL E (modem7x)
or CTL O (smodem). These are, of course the menu calls on those
modem programs. This is not a critical problem, obviously, just a
nusance I would like to avoid if possible.
   Any advice??

	I would like to see quidelines for submission of documentation
to nets/rcpms. 

	Quite often I have spent a lot of time changing document
files to make them printable on the local system, and a few
guidelines might make that type of labor unnecessary.  I would
like to see some discussion of this.

1.	Place a comment line at the bottom of the file to
	indicate where the file ends.

It is nice to know that the file was not truncated in transit.

2.	If you are submitting a file generated with WordStar,
	do not use right margin justification.

If the parity (soft) bit gets stripped somewhere along the line,
it is not too much work to go through the file and replace the
hard <cr>'s with soft <cr>'s, but it is a real pain trying to
replace/remove the extra spaces.

3.	Do not use 70+ columns for line width.

Some people are limited to using typewriter based printers,
and would be limitted to 66 columns.  That's the reason I've had
to reformat some non-soft WordStar files.

4.	Use ^L or '.PA' or equivalent for page breaks.  Do not
	use 12 spaces to generate a new page.

It is a lot easier to change a formfeed to blank lines than to change
blank lines to a formfeed.  Same goes for WordStar's '.PA' command.

	This list is not complete or all inclusive.  I hope that
it may prime the pumps so that we can get a GOOD standard for
exchanging document file.  I would prefer to receive all the
files in pure WordStar format, but every one of the mainframe
systems that I deal with, from VAX's to CompuServe, have
path restrictions for the parity bit.  If this was discussed
awhile back, and I missed it, I would appreciate a summary
-BY MAIL-.

I was wondering if there are any S-100 floppy disk controller boards that
have the following set of features:

1) Board buffers a sector, and is intelligient enough that the CPU can
issue a command, do something else, and come back later for the data in
response to an interrupt (similarly for writing).

2) Works with single and double density drives.

3) Works with 8" and 5 1/4" drives.

4) Works with 48 tpi and 96 tpi drives.

5) Items of flavors in (2), (3), and (4) arbitrarily mixable.

6) Controls 2 to 4 drives.

Anybody know of boards meeting all or most of these specs?  (1) is important
for good performance in a banked multi-user system.  Thanks -- Eliot

In response to LHILL's question about getting control characters
to the central computer, when MDM or SMODEM uses some of them
for its own commands:
SURE: ADD A ROUTINE (MDM HAS IT) to have the program take a
character to mean the next character is a command to the modem
program, not a command to send downline in terminal mode.  Then
EVERYTHING not preceeded by that char (I use ^^) is a command
to the computer you are connected to.  That is very necessary
if you want to use, say, EMACS, which uses all the control and
meta characters you can think of.  (The implementation in
MDM is reversed; all control characters are sent to MDM unless
the special character precedes them; I reversed the test to get
the above result.)  Note ^^ is control, up-arrow, or control 6
on some machines.  (P.S.; I switched from that to ^_ since that
is the "down-arrow" key on my TRS-80 Mod II.)

The current version of MODEM7xx (which is now MDM705) allows the
user-configurable option of fixing the terminal mode so that ALL
control characters may be sent to the modem, and only those prefaced
with an intercept character (control up-arrow) will be sent to
MODEM7xx.  The control up-arrow itself may also be sent to the mmodem
by typing it twice.  I'm sure you'll find this latest version well
worth having.  It has many other features, like being able to turn on
the printer while in the terminal mode (even if the printer is slower
than the incoming data on the modem).  There is a printer buffer.

I don't like to see people distribute DOC files in WordStar format
because it **ASSUMES** that everyone has WordStar.  HOW ABSURD!
There's nothing wrong with distributing a WordStar OUTPUT file which
is already formatted (yes, even with multiple CRLFs instead of
formfeeds).  Most RCPM systems are SQUEEZing the files these days and
those multiple characters are stored aas only a few bytes in a
squeezed file.

Hi,... in the new (and super) MDM705 (the MDM7xx series are
an extension of the old MODEM7xx series of modem programs),
there is a toggle that allows you to type those characters
directly to the modem without being intercepted by the program.
To type those program control characters,you must type a 
control-^ which is "local escape character". Irv Hoff (MDM7xx..)
really did a great job on this one - before when using EMACS,I
couldnt use MODEM7xx. The MDM7xx series are in the INFO-CPM archive
#61 on CPM; directory. Enjoy!

-Ed
ps: since USC is in California, you might try calling my RCP/M
(DataTech HQ 415-595-0541) to get those programs but I'm sure you
can get it through the net.

Take a look at the versions of modem7xx and MDM70x that have a three letter
command at the modem command line that toggles the program to allow the
sending of control characters. The commsnd is 'TLC". When thusly toggled,
you must enter a contr-^ and then control E or O to do local modem
commands. Otherwise, contro characters will have no affect on your
modem terminal operation....Neat, huh?

I've had no luck with info-printers @ MC so I'll try this list.

Could somebody tell me the escape sequences necessary to enter/exit
sub/superscript mode with GRAFTRAX+?  I need to know whether I can interface
it to WordStar easily before spending money.  Local dealers have been most
unhelpful!
-Michael

P.S.  By the way, how do characters in this mode look?  Readable?

The character sequences for GRAFTRAX+ are as follows:
	"<ESC> S 0"  => sets superscript mode
	"<ESC> S 1"  => sets subscript mode

The setting of the scripts requires the 3 character sequence although super-
script takes a binary zero to be set, any number greater than zero will set
subscript.

The real problem comes when turning off one of the scripts as you will see.

	"<ESC> T"  =>	Resets supercript, subscript, and unidirectional
			printing.  Does not turn off double strike).
			NOTE: The setting of the script modes also set double
			      strike on and unidirectional printing on.
	"<ESC> H"  =>	Turns off double strike mode, superscript and sub-
			script mode.  Leaves unidirectional printing on.

These script modes are VERY impressive as far as readability.  You can also
set compressed mode, italics mode, prior to scripting.  One thing to watch
out for is that the using of emphasized mode cannot be mixed with the script
modes.  There are some patchs available through some of the RCPM's that enable
you to "Patch" wordstar to ease the setting of these modes since the Scipt
patch area in Wordstar does not do the right thing.

If you need more information reply to this with an address and I will send
the Graftrx+ function sheet that contains all of the escape sequences.

	Sorry to carp, but the stuff with the local escape character
was done by me at about MODEM769. The reason was precisely the one you
gave, i.e. to use the program with EMACS. The history file has been
obliterated. The changes in going from 796 to 705 have not been major
from the point of view of new features and I believe that Frank Gaude
has had a lot to do with the changes.

  Yes, you can have much more than 256 files on a disk; set the
DIRMAX field in your BIOS to whatever you'd like.  There is a
catch however: you must reserve sufficient space for the directory 
via AL0 and AL1; since these two bytes form a 16-bit vector which
is used to initialize the allocation vector, your directory maximum
size is 16 blocks (which may vary from 1K to 16K, depending on how
BLKSHF and BLKMSK are set up).  Hence, with 1K blocks, your dir-
ectory cannot exceed 16K (16 1K blocks; since there is room in a 1K
block for 32 32-byte directory entries, 512 would be the maximum
directory size when using 1K blocks).

Note that you can increase the directory size only be enlarging the
block size, and this is at the expense of efficiency when considering
small files.

Tried this msg a while back, but mailer died.

Those of you with TOPS-20 implementations of MODEM7 may need to be
aware of a new 'feature' of the OS.  TOPS-20 is now trying to impose
flow control on its TTY lines.  A guy at ISI told me that after about
60 chars coming in at 1200-up, the 20 would start throwing out CTL-S
characters trying to stop the sender.  These CTL-S's are interpreted
by MODEM7 (micro side) and MDM705, not as a NAK, but rather as ACK*
(not ACK).  This causes repeated retransmission attempts and finally
aborts the process.  The only way we could tell this was to hook up a
data line monitor.  The 20 side would ACK a block, but the CTL-S had
already initiated a retransmission.  Obviously, this only occurs when
you are trying to download from a micro to the 20.

  Solution:  In GETACK, after you compare for ACK, compare for NAK.  If
not NAK, loop through GETACK.  This will ONLY allow ACK and NAK to
be used for control, but it gets the job done.  Might cause some problems,
but we haven't experienced any.  

  Same guy at ISI told me that 131 or 132 characters at high load and
4800 baud would lose half the block on the 20 side.  In our experience,
this has not been the case.  The front end seems to handle our blocks
without any loss.

BE AWARE!!  If you simply add the two lines necessary for the fix
above, overlay segments for MDM705 will be affected.  We have made a 
separate overlay to correct the problem which removes some of the 
interpretation code in GETACK to maintain spacing.

If anyone sees problems with this approach, please let me know.

Doug

A company named Enercomp sells graphics software
for the CPM user.  I bought a copy two months ago and 
hae the following two major comments:

1)	It works.  You can use your Epson MX-80 or
other dotmatrix printer as if it were a plotter.  It's 
similar to using a SLOW calcomp plotter.  There are
calls for plotting points, lines, 
setting scale, labeling axis etc.
Part of the package is a menu driven option 
for generating pie charts, bar charts and X-Y 
graphs.

2)	The system is "HARD" to use. For example, case is significant 
in commands!  plot <> PLOT.  When it fails (or you
fail  to satisfy its rigid syntax), you get no 
clear indication of the problem.  This program has  a
sort of 1960's feeling about it (It should
be running under IBSYS not CPM).

Nevertheless, it proved valuable and convenient.
It is a low cost way to get printing capability.

In your message you talked about running both VMS and UNIX  concurrently

Thanks much for the report on the Enercomp plotting software. I have
seen ads for it recently as well as a number of other packages of
similar purpose and am interested in purchasing one. A nice feature
(though not a must) would be an optional Microangelo driver as we have
several of them here.

If anyone could comment on any other packages of this ilk, I would

Thanks for the report on TOPS-20 and MODEM7xx, Doug.  This problem has
been addressed, and MDM706 (due out in a few days) will have code to
allow the user to set the program to accept only ACK and NAK and
ignore everything else when it is sending.  This will not only fix the
TOPS-20 (and other mainframes) problem, but should also help those who
have had problems with BBN's short-sighted use of a 64-character
buffer in TAC's.  We're hoping they may expand that someday, but in
the meantime when the TAC's buffer gets full, it sends out an 87h
(bell with high-order bit turned on), which causes MODEM7xx to resend
the sector (thinking it was a "not ACK").

XMODEM74 is also due out in a few days and will have the same option.
I've been testing it on my system and even on micro-to-micro transfers
it does offer improved operation.

Consider this possibility:  you, the "sender" have just sent a
128-byte sector and are now waiting for the ACK from the receiving
end.  Suppose there is some noise on the line during the time you are
waiting for the ACK.  If you take "not ACK" as same as NAK (the way
the old program does), you immediately start re-sending the sector.
Assuming that the receiving end had sent you an ACK, this is an extra
repeat of a sector he already got (which he will of course ignore
since he already has it).  The penalty is the time it takes to send
that sector.  Suppose the same thing happens at the end of that
sector.  If you have a noisy line, it's possible to resend that same
sector MANY times, even though the receiving end has it already and
doesn't want it again!

In my opinion, all versions of Ward Christensen's MODEM2 program
(which includes the various MODEM7xx and XMODEM programs) should be
made to require ACK or NAK after sending a sector and everything else
received while waiting for this should be ignored.

Hopefully the mainframe versions of MODEM will be changed to this new
approach and it may make life a lot easier for us all.  It's been VERY
sucessful on my RCPM's XMODEM.

                    AS-100 Virtual Floppy Disk
               Controller for 5.25 inch Winchesters

                           April, 1983

The AS-100 is the only Winchester disk controller that connect 
directly to your existing floppy disk controller.  The AS-100 
interfaces to the host as one or two floppy disk drives.

*     The host interface is totally compatible with the Shugart 
Associates SA850 and SA450 floppy disk drive interfaces, 
permitting simple connection to virtually any floppy-based 
computer system.

*    An on-board microcomputer permits buffered seek.  Step rates 
of up to 2500 steps per second are supported.

*    Automatic read-after-write check by the AS-100 ensures data 
reliability.

*    The AS-100 dissipates only 5 watts for cool operation and 
low power supply drain.

*     The floppy track format is soft-sectored and can be 
formatted in any convenient single or double density format.  All 
the un-formatted track capacity of the Winchester is available to 
the user.

CONFIGURATION

The AS-100 controller supports a single Winchester drive with 
two, four or eight heads.  The host interface can be configured 
as one or two floppy disks, single or double sided.  
Configuration is by jumper plugs and can be changed at any time 
for any drive/host combination.

The host interface can be configured as either eight inch floppy 
or minifloppy.  If the eight inch configuration is selected, the 
interface is exactly as defined by Shugart Associates as the 
SA850.  If the minifloppy interface is selected, the floppy data 
rate is divided by two, however, the full track capacity of the 
Winchester is still available (10,400 bytes).

There is no limitation within the AS-100 as to how many tracks 
there may be, therefore, Winchesters of any capacity may be 
supported.  One popular configuration, using the Seagate 
Technology ST-506 yields two double-sided floppies, each with 
nine 1024 byte sectors per track and 153 cylinders for a total 
capacity of 5.5 megabytes, formatted.

*NOTE:    The AS-100 does not accommodate write data pre-
compensation.  Write Data must be presented on-time.  A minor 
modification to your floppy controller may be necessary.

COMPATIBILITY

The AS-100 is compatible with the Seagate Technology family of 
Winchester disk drives and with others which support the Seagate 
interface.  Among these are:
      Tandon    TM-600
      RMS       RMS-500
      IMI       
And many others.

SPECIFICATIONS

    Electrical:
              +5 volts @ 1.0 amps
              +12 volts @ 0.1 amps
    Physical:
              Length:  11.0 inches
              Width:  5.75 inches
              Height:  0.5 inches
              Weight:  0.6 pounds

SOFTWARE CONSIDERATIONS

The AS-100 has little software impact on most floppy-based 
computer systems.  The operating system must be told, however, 
that 'these floppies are bigger' than the others.  Using the CP/M 
operating system, this is relatively simple.  You merely change 
and dedicate an existing disk parameter block to the Winchester 
or create a unique table for the Winchester.  For example, the 
table below will define a single 5.5 megabyte Winchester:

    DPB0:      DW	144		;SEC PER TRACK
    	       DB	6		;BLOCK SHIFT
    	       DB	63		;BLOCK MASK
	       DB	3		;EXTNT MASK
	       DW	685		;DISK SIZE-1
	       DW	511		;DIRECTORY MAX
	       DB	192		;ALLOC0
	       DB	0		;ALLOC1
	       DW	0		;CHECK SIZE

I seem to remember seeing something a couple of months ago which
described how to (from a running program) do what the CTRL-P does.  I.e.
to cause everything sent to the console to go to the list device as
well.  I know about exchanging the BIOS pointers to make a Basic PRINT
statement go to the printer, but that isn't quite what I need.  Anyone
who knows how to start and stop the CTRL-P toggle within software,
please drop me a line.  Sorry I wasn't paying better attention before.
Didn't need it 'till now.  Thanks much.  Ron H.

One nice way of doing this is to implement IOBYTE.  You can then PEEK
and POKE at address 3 (the IOBYTE) to turn the printer/console on-off
at will.  This is much better than POKEing into the operating system.
There have been some articles on the subject.  One that I recall was
"Implementing the CP/M IOBYTE" in Microsystems magazine.  I don't
recall what the issue was, but maybe SLIBES at MC can help with that
information..

I have acquired a D. C. Hayes 80-103 S-100 plug-in modem board. The hardware
seems to work fine, but the software leaves a lot to be desired.  In order to
rtemedy the situation,I managed to obtain a copy of CP/MUG's  public domain
distribution vol. 79, which contains MODEM741.ASM, MODEM7.DOC,
&MODEM7.LIB, & MODEM7.SET.  The doc files mention nothing about equates
and/or modifications to MODEM741 for this board.  Now, being a reasonably
competent hacker, I can puzzle out the various and assorted status bits, command
bytes, etc., but beyond that things get real sticky.  My questions are:

1) The MODEM741.ASM file is set up *only* for the PMMI modem, as
delivered.  I have never seen this animal, & some differences stand out as
obious, i.e., the PMMI board has an extra modem control port, MODCTRLP2, I
believe.  This is easy enough to remove, but if I do, how do I know where to
redistribute the functions of this port over to the D. C. Hayes' single control port
without reading the entire 60 odd pages of code in the source file for references. 
That is an imposing task for anyone coming into this cold.

2) If I can avoid the above by finding somone who has already set up
MODEM7XX to work with this board, I would really appreciate a pointer or an
upload that is accessable tome here at work (XEROX, El Segundo, Ca.).  Anybody
out there got the right stuff? 

3)  If I get the equates for an earlier version of MODEM7XX, will they be all
that is needed for MODEM705/6?

To anyone not in possesstion of the 80-103 board, this one predates the
Micromodem 100, Its base address is selectable, & it generates its own clock.  The
ports are BASE (modem data transfer port), BASE+1 (modem status port, i. e.,
TBE, OE, etc.) & modem control (baudrate, character length, no. of stop bits, &
parity.

		Thanx in advance.

	I did not mean to imply that I thought all DOC files should
be in WordStar format.  In fact, my biggest complaint is pulling in
files that have been printed by WordStar with right-hand margin
justification turned on.  I like to reformat document files to fit
the screen of my Osborne.  However, if they have been right justified,
it is a major job to eliminate all of those extra spaces.  That is
my first complaint.  

	I find it interesting that of all the files that I have pulled
in named xxxxxxx.ws, not one has contained soft spaces and cr's.

	The one about preferring ^L over 8 blank lines
comes from trying to 'pr' documents on a UNIX system.

An organization with which I am associated needs a computer.  It
should service 2-5 terminals.  The main box should house a hard
disk of at least 10Mbytes.  In order, the preferred operating
systems are MP/M-80, MP/M-86, and Unix; these are a group of
users, not a group of hackers.  

If your group's computer is described above, I'd like to hear from
you.  I suspect that many who read this message will have advised
some group on a computer purchase, and then, perhaps, have checked
to see how well the system is working.  Please don't reply about
machines available tomorrow; up and working and tested counts
much more for this application.

Hi!  Your message about running Unix and VMS concurrently was forwarded
to me from someone here who reads Info-CPM.  I think that I can answer
most of the questions you raised in that message.  First of all, you are
correct that it is not possible run both VMS and Unix at the same time
on the same machine.  However, I, along with a few other people here at
Rice University, am writing a Unix simulation called Phoenix to run under
VAX/VMS that allows nearly any Unix program to run unmodified under VMS.
Phoenix provides complete Unix compatibility down to the object code level
with only minor exceptions not yet completely implemented.  Programs
currently running here include the "Bourne" shell, the C shell (with almost
full job control), Gosling's Emacs, vi, uucp, Franz lisp, (name your
favorite large Unix program here probably...).  The system is not quite
complete, but should be ready for distribution in a month or two.  It will
be available for only a modest distribution charge to all sites with a Bell
Unix license.  I'm not on Info-CPM, so for more information, mail
directly to me, or (preferably) to:

   In the April issue of MICROSYSTEMS, under NEW PRODUCTS, you find the
following:

   Access Price - $2495
   
  The built in printer delivers high quality printing at 80 cps.  Up to
132 chars can be printed per line on 8.5" paper.  In addition to the
96 char ascii set, graphics are available.  A program INCLUDED in the
software package allows various type styles to be used.
  The internal modem is a standard bell 103 type compatible.  It has a
direct line modular jack as well as an acoustical coupler (take your
pick)  It has four operating modes: manual originate, manual answer,
auto dial, and directory support. 
   The 7" amber screen is a full 80x25 line (the 25th being status of course)
Data and time display are available on the 25th line.  The screen has
user selectable attributes: inverse, blink blank, underline, double
underline, half intensity and normal intensity.
   The system has one parallel port which is centronics compatible OR
bidirectional. One fully implemented IEEE 488 port, and 2(two) rs232 ports
with software selectable speeds up to 9600 baud. 
   Two 5.25" Single sided-double density disks provide for 184K per drive.
An OPTION of Double sided-DD disks is offered for a total of 736Kbytes.
The controller will also support 8" drives in addition to the 5.25".
  The software packages consists of the following:
    a. CP/M 2.2
    b. Perfect Writer
    c.     "   Speller
    d.     "   Filer
    e.     "   Calc
    f. Fancy Font (by SoftCraft) provides fancy fonts (clever name)

    g. Mbasic
    h. CB-80
    i. Communications package (un-named)

This dounds like a fair deal to me, although I am now the proud owner of
a bouncing baby Heath H100 full color system (WITH microangelo boards!)
so I don't think it is for me, but others might like it.  The company 
address for those who wish is:

Access Matrix Copr.
2159 Bearing Drive
San Jose, ca 95131   Phone - (408) 263-3660

Enjoy... (p.s. All those with microangelo boards on ANY system, if you have
any tips for new users of such devices, I would appreciate hearing them.
I have only been able to do minimal things with it so far, and would love
to hear more frlmo those who know. Thanks...)

Frank,

I, too, thought VMS and UNIX could not run on a VAX at the same time.
We DO have a system at work, however, called EUNICE.  It is a UNIX 7
look-alike (minor differences, tho) which runs under VMS.  It tends to

TOPIC :  MDM706 MODEM PROGRAM INSTALLATION INFORMATION
FROM  :  IRVIN M. HOFF
DATE  :  04/04/83

       This program is based on one originally written by Ward Christ-
ensen in Sept. 1977.  It has since undergone a considerable number of
changes.  Two of the latest were (1) printer control while in the "T"
(Terminal) mode and (2) combining the macro library into the program to
eliminate extra files -- also allowing assembly with ASM as well as MAC
or other popular assemblers.

NOTE:  Special configuration files are being added for specific types of
       computers.  Several are available as shown below.  Others will be
       provided for popular computers using external modems.  This file
       will be updated accordingly.

       To adapt this version to your equipment, you will want to get
some of the following programs:

        Program name    Squeezed Name          Purpose

        MDM706.ASM      MDM706.AQM        (source code file)
        MDM706.COM      MDM706.OBJ        (object code file)
	MDM706.DOC      MDM706.DQC        (how-to-use file)
        MDM706.INF      MDM706.IQF        (information file)
        MDM706..SET      MDM706.SQT        (how to set file)
        MDM706AP.ASM    MDM706AP.AQM      (Apple II overlay file)
        MDM706DP.ASM    MDM706DP.AQM      (Datapoint 1560 overlay)	
        MDM706GP.ASM    MDM706GP.AQM      (General purpose overlay)
        MDM706H8.ASM    MDM706H8.AQM      (Heath/Zenith H89 file)
        MDM706HZ.ASM    MDM706HZ.AQM      (Heath/Zenith Z-100 file)
        MDM706KP.ASM    MDM706KP.AQM      (KayPro overlay file)
        MDM706NM.ASM    MDM706NM.AQM      (Phone number overlay)
        MDM706OS.ASM    MDM706OS.AQM      (Osborne overlay file)
        MDM706XE.ASM    MDM706XE.AQM      (Xerox 820 overlay file)


       (The minimum would be any pair in one of the examples shown
below.)

       There are numerous ways by which you can set the proper ports,
status pin values, etc. for your equipment.


     1) Use DDT, SID or DUU with:      MDM706.COM    and
                                       MDM706.SET
                                                             or        
     2) Use your editor, ASM (or MAC)  MDM706.COM    and
        and DDT (or SID) with:         MDM706xx.ASM

               (706xx stands for an appropriate overlay)
                                                             or
     3) Use your editor, ASM (or MAC)  MDM706.ASM


        One of those should appeal to you.  The program is designed to
work immediately for PMMI users with no changes - just use MDM706.COM.
(You might wish to change some of the available options, however.)

        When ready to use the program, type 'H' (for 'HELP'), hit RET
and it will display helpful information on the commands.  There are so
many commands there are several pages.  You can abort the display with
a CTL-C.  (One of the most useful features being CTL-P to toggle your
printer on/off.)  You can also type a question mark (?) which shows the
current parameters.

        The program has received numerous worthwhile optional features
in the past several months.

I'd like to start yet another list, of TurboDOS hackers this time.
And it will be a working group, rather than just a bulletin board
information-passing list.  In other words, it will (hopefully) be
discussions of TurboDOS internals and exchange of public domain
drivers and hacks which are not of general interest to others.

So, send your requests to be added to the as-yet-non-existent
TurboDOS-Hackers list to me, and I'll see if there's enough of us out
there to warrant a list.  I'll post the notice of the creation or
deferment of the list late next week to give all the autodialer relays
a chance to pass this message along...

Charlie,
     Just thought you might be interested, but our club librarian just got an
interesting package from the folks at DR and they said that for users without
bank select ZCPR2 was a much better way to go than CPM+.  We had assumed as
much but were pleasantly surprised to hear it from the horse's mouth. They also
included a very nice package of literature with info about most of the various
user groups and of course other DR products.
     You might pass on to Richard Conn the praise that he is getting from DR. 
Do you suppose that they are trying to recruit him???? Heaven forbid - we need
him too much!

It's easy to write an assembly language program that will filter
Wordstar format stuff to standard.  Test for 8th bit set; if so,
unset it, and add one space, ignoring everything that's a space
until you get to the next non-space; to be more sophisticated,
test to see if the word ended in a . or a ? and add two spaces
if so.
	It took me about an hour to write one of those.  Uset
the program in the MAC document as a model to show how to open
and close files.

TOPIC :  FIX FOR MDM706 (.ASM AND/OR .COM FILES)
FROM  :  IRV HOFF W6FFC
DATE  :  11 APR 83

     If using the "SBQ" (Send Batch in Quiet mode), it often causes
a problem.  Change the following byte on the MDM706.COM file via DDT:

0BCC  4C to 5B

B>DDT MDM706.COM
DDT VERS 2.2
4200 0100
-S0BCC
0BCC 4C 5B             (add the 5B beside the 4C, hit return)
0BCD 1D .              (add the period to return to DDT prompt)
-G0                    (G0 to go back to CP/M prompt

B>SAVE 65 MDM706.COM   (program is now fixed)

     That puts the "Awaiting name NAK" into the quiet mode and clears
up the problem if using the program in that unusual manner.  If using
the .ASM file, make this change:

SENDFN:   CALL   ILPRT
                         change to:
SENDFN:   CALL   ILPRTQ

     We have a MDM707 file ready for distribution that incorporates this
change.   It also adds an automatic timeout in the receive mode after 3
minutes of inactivity.  Up to now we intentionally have had no timeout
at all.  That has inadvertently caused some problems.  This will help
prevent permanent lockout until the operator reboots.

Jerry,
    Thanks for your reply.   Epson sure does advertise, don't they?
 
By the way, what do you think of the QX-10?  I'm looking for a
computer, under $3000 ,  with CP/M, at least 64K RAM, minimum of 2 disk drives
with max storage, (desireable to have bit-mapped graphics...but not reqd),
good video attributes (ie. inverse , high-light, blink), detachable keyboard
with programmable function keys, a *big* screen (at least 12"), and good
software included (minimum of Wordstar or equiv, z80 or 8080 assembler,
Basic of some flavor, a debugger such as DDT).

Keith,

I obtained MDM706 AQM from the Oxgate system in northern Calif. and made
some changes to it so that I could customize it for my Xerox 820-II.  When I
assembled it using MAC I got two undefined variables.
The first one was MVI  A,RUB.  RUB was not defined so I defined it and all was
well.  The second error was:

SCKSER:   MVI  A,BDNMCH

My question is, "Do you know what BDNMCH is suppose to be equated to?".

I know it refers to telling the RECEIVER that a bad name was sent, but that is
all I know.

Any assistance would be appreciated.

Thanks in advance! ! ! !

Can someone tell me whether the modem7 program does anything smart when
in the CONTROL-Y mode (buffering incoming characters in memory) when
the memory gets full? Some programs send an X-OFF while they write to
disk. I suspect that nothing useful happens. Would this be a useful
mod? Sometimes I must download long (>64K) files from remote mainframes
which do not have "modem" capability, but who use X-ON/X-OFF.

I'm looking for a good calendar/scheduling program to run under
CP/M, and I'd like the opinions of anyone willing to give them.
I'd like suggestions on what you've used and might recommend.
I'm interested in programs having the following features:
1) Appointments are cyclic; i.e., every Thursday from 14:00-16:00
   between January 1 and June 30.  Appointments can be modified
   by adding or deleting specific dates, and deleting an appointment
   deletes every specific meeting.
2) Reminders are displayed; i....e., every day from Feb 1 to Feb 10, I
   want to be reminded that there's a film/show/conference going on.
   I would like to see messages like "8 days 'til April 15!".
3) Schedules can be kept for individuals, and I can ask questions
   like "show me every 2 hour block on weekdays between 9:00 and
   17:00 that George and Fred both have free."

In-reply-to:    Your message of 12 April 1983 03:53 EST

According to H-P computers in Westwood Village, they are going to be 
here next Tuesday. 

I spent about an hour and a quarter playing with one today 
(purportedly with old software;  256k version)  and it's very 
easy to learn, and not bad as a word processor (a little slow).  
Also, Pie/Bar/Line etc charts are easy to create, and has an easy 
to use, nice calendar system.

The software needs a bit more integration, but it's nice for the price
($2295 w/64k & $2995 w/256k both w/2 drives).  It's still a Z80, but the 
software and (easy to use for a novice) interface make it attractive.
Offhand this would be a fun machine to have at home.

The rep said that there are five expansion slots in the machine, and that
color would be available down the road, as well as external hard disk.

The rep also thought that the user would not be able to 
add functions to the Valdocs system.  Does anyone have any info on
this?

The latest version of MODEM7, the CP/M file transfer program,
is now available on MIT-MC.  The list of files is the same as
the one I sent announcing MDM706, except for the increment in
the version number of the name.

The new version incorporates fixes and improvements received
from users.  Feedback is encouraged.  Send to INFO-MODEM7@MIT-MC.
If you are still using an old version of this program, you're
missing a lot of new features.

Your problem is solved if you use "Ascom".  The new problem is, it's not public

I am looking forward to reading alot of interesting info in this newsgroup.
Initially I have two questions:

1) I've read recently on the net about a Z80 coded version of CP/M called
ZCPR2. Jerry Pournelle had transferred a message from Rick Conn onto the net
(rconn@brl.arpa) describing the status of it at the time. I wrote Rick and I
haven't heard anything. In short, does anyone else know how to get a copy of
that software?

2) I'd also read of Public domain CP/M software that is available through an
arpa net location and that one was supposed to write Info-Cpm-Request@Brl to
get on some type of "mailing list" and have access to the software. I
similarly wrote them and got no response. Does anyone out on the net know
whether this source is generally available, especially to someone like me
who doesn't have a direct login on arpanet?

I've posted this to the net in hopes that the information will be generally
useful to everyone. If someone has access to other information, such as
nation wide CPM users groups, etc., I for one, would like to see that
published on the net. Or you can mail me and I'll post it.

Thanks....

*** BDS C has some libraries to handle float and long types, but not
    an intrinsic part of the language.

Caveat:
   I do not have actual experience with all these languages, this is from other
sources.

Note: Smallc version is in public domain, can send it to you over uucp.

Don't send any money without receiving tangible collateral.  Looks like a scam
or naivete on the part of the 'company'.  

It would probably be very worthwhile to make the Postal Inspectors aware of the

Subject:  Public Domain Software Documentation

        The New York Amateur Computer Club, Inc, has published  a
series  of  DOCUMENTATION catalogs of the public domain software.
There are 7 catalogs so far, each containing over  200  pages  of
documentation  on  public domain software.  This documentation is
almost exclusively copied from the  documentation  files  on  the
public domain disks themselves.

        I skimmed through all 7 catalogs this afternoon, and they
seem  to  be  quite worthwhile to get.  As I see it, they provide
three main services:

                1) they provide a good  overview  of  the  public
domain  software in SIG/M and CP/M UG; more than just listing the
names of the files/programs on these disks, the documentation  is
included, so you can scan the documentation to see what you real-
ly are dealing with before you acquire the disks

                2) they provide a HARD COPY of the documentation;
once  one  obtains  a disk of software, he usually wants to print
out  the  documentation  anyway;  these  catalogs  are  in  good,
letter-quality print and contain tables of content

                3) they consolidate  the  information  on  public
domain  software and are provided at a reasonable cost (the NYACC
sells them at just slightly above cost, and the profit is used to
fund club activities)

        Several people have been expressing  concerns  about  the
ZCPR2  and  SYSLIB  documentation.   Among other things, the last
three catalogs contain ALL of the ZCPR2 and SYSLIB documentation.

        The catalogs contain the following information:

Book 1 (204 pages):  CP/M 1 to 49; SIG/M 1 to 18
Book 2 (214 pages):  CP/M 50 to 54, 78, 79 (CP/M 55 to 77 are reissues of
        SIG/M 1, 2, 11, 4-10, 13-25 resp); SIG/M 19 to 42
Book 3 (217 pages):  SIG/M 43 to 60
Book 4 (210 pages): CP/M 80 to 84; SIG/M 61 to 76
Book 5 and Book 6 (400+ pages): SIG/M 77 to 106 (ZCPR1 is in SIG/M 77
        and ZCPR2 is in SIG/M 98 to 108; SYSLIB is in SIG/M 88 to 90,
        106 to 108)
Book 7 (200+ pages): SIG/M 107 (SYSLIB documentation)

        For those interested in ZCPR2 and SYSLIB, Books  5  to  7
contain good hardcopies of all of the documentation.

        Each book costs $10 (including shipping) in North America
and $15 (via airmail) overseas.  All orders must be prepaid in US

Subject:  More PD Software Documentation

        The San Diego Computer Society  has  recently  asked  for
(and  received)  permission to copy and sell the ZCPR2 and SYSLIB
documentation.  When I receive official word that they are  ready
to receive orders, I'll post to the net.

        Also note (from the previous  message  about  the  NYACC)
that the NYACC documentation is priced quite reasonably ($10 incl
shipping for 200+ pages), and this is because the NYACC publishes
in  lots of 2000 copies.  They are currently distributing the do-
cumentation, and they have already sold a TON  (figuratively)  of
their catalogs at the Trenton Computer Festival.

        Note:  I believe the San Diego Computer Society is also a
non-profit organization, like the New York Amateur Computer Club,
Inc.  By purchasing their  materials,  you  are  contributing  to
their club's activity funds as well.

Keith,

I obtained MDM706 AQM from the Oxgate system in northern Calif. and made
some changes to it so that I could customize it for my Xerox 820-II.  When I
assembled it using MAC I got two undefined variables.
The first one was MVI  A,RUB.  RUB was not defined so I defined it and all was
well.  The second error was:

SCKSER:   MVI  A,BDNMCH

My question is, "Do you know what BDNMCH is suppose to be equated to?".

I know it refers to telling the RECEIVER that a bad name was sent, but that is
all I know.

Any assistance would be appreciated.

Thanks in advance! ! ! !

Bob,

        SYSLIBI.WS is a brief intro to SYSLIB.   SYSLIBID.WS  and
SYSLIBR.WS are no longer needed.  Hope you just read these refer-
ences within the text as opposed to include files.

        Pages Dist-1 to Dist-5 of the SYSLIB  User  and Reference
Manual  tell  you  about  what the distribution files are.  Also,
track  the  updates  (Z2SYS-nn.MOD  files)  for  future  changes.
Z2SYS-1.MOD and Z2SYS-2.MOD currently exist.

        Finally, make sure you have current versions of the docu-
mentation  (as  opposed  to the pre-release drafts).  The current
SYSLIB User and Reference Manual is  for  version  2.4,  and  the
manual is dated 4 Feb 83.  The current SYSLIB User's Guide is for
2.3 and is Rev B of the guide, dated 14 Dec 83.

        These current versions and  all  future  changes  can  be
tracked  by obtaining the baseline documents and all Z2SYS-nn.MOD
files released and updating as they announce new versions of  the
manuals.  The same is true for ZCPR2.

                Rick

It appears that I will again be working for Digital Research this summer.
Unfortunately, DRI is not on any net, so they don't get the opportunity to
communicate with netland.  This is my attempt to show DRI just what they're
missing.  I'd also like to give you the opportunity to talk to DRI.

I'd like comments and suggestions about DRI and CP/M from you out there in
netland.  Please feel free to comment on customer service, suggestions for
features, or problems with any DRI products.  All messages will be kept
confidential, and no responses will be tendered.  Flames will be re-directed
to the bit bucket.  Hopefully, this will get us all better response from
DRI. 

I am not a DRI employee (yet), and this query is not part of any commercial
venture.

Cheers,

Subject:  Perfect Writer bugs==> Plu*Perfect Writer enhancements
To: INFO-CPM@mit-mc.arpa

This is for those of you using Perfect Writer on KayPro-IIs (and other
machines, I suspect), from a message I recently received:

--------------------

We set out to swat one bug, found a whole nest, and decided that
the useful thing to do was upgrade the Perfect Writer editor itself for
the KayProII.  The patches are intricate and incorporate a host of new
features.  Here's a summary:


Bugs corrected in KayPro-II version 1.03 Perfect Writer:

	- delete sentence (Escape K) [fatal if last sentence not terminated
	       by end-of-sentence token].
	- help (Escape ?) with missing help file [fatal].
	- report status (Control-X =) [line number incorrect].
	- reverse incremental search (Control-R) [failed for single
	       character searches].
	- up-arrow, down-arrow [failed in view mode]
	- delete line forward (Control-C) [modified document in view mode]

Plu*Perfect Writer enhancements:

	- Automatic motor shutoff after reading/writing/swapping.
	- Automatic disk reset.
	- Variable swap file size.
	- User-definable keypad/arrow keys send ANY Perfect Writer commands.
	- Single-keystroke toggle of insert/overtype mode.
	- List directory and free space.
	- Reset disks.
	- Toggle between numeric keypad and enhanced command keypad mode.
	- Settable default margins, tab spacing, and mode.
	- Split line and indent.
	- Reverse Line Scroll.
	

A disk for the KayPro-II with these enhancements and all bug corrections
is available, complete with extensive documentation, from

	PluPerfect Systems
	Box 1494
	Idyllwild CA 92349

Included are automatic patches for Perfect Writer, the swap file, and
the BDOS, and a utility to configure the swap file.  Also, the CCP is
replaced with a ZCPR-like command processor that features an enhanced TYPE
command with forward and reverse page and line modes.

The price is $25 (plus sales tax for California residents).

			-----**********-----

Users who want to install a minimal protective patch can avoid the two fatal
bugs by putting a RETurn instruction at the addresses of the Delete-Sentence
and Help commands.  The following addresses are from PW.SYM for the
KayProII PW version 1.03:

	MHELP    4597 hex
	MDELSENT 50B5 hex

	- USE DDT to read in PW.COM
	- assemble a RET at the two addresses
	- exit DDT and SAVE 136 PW.COM

This is, of course, just a patch around the problem, not a solution, but
it does prevent losing text.  The PluPerfect Systems disk corrects the bugs
so that the commands do function correctly.

	I have had a problem with Ascom - the 8-bit version (on a Kaypro)
was not able to talk to the 16-bit version (on a DEC Rainbow 100).  
Actually, they could talk in terminal and BLOCK mode, but we really
wanted BLOCKV mode to work so that a whole disk could be sent.  No luck.
Westico and Ascom said they have had "some minor problems" themselves
but that it "should" work.  Right.  Also, the CPMUG protocol does not
completely work with something like modem7 - Ascom never sends the 
"end of transfer" message back, letting modem7 hang until it times out.
Otherwise, a very nice product - I like the human interface.

I am recently possessed of a DEC VT-180 system which runs CP/M

I recieved absolutely no useful technical information for it.
For obvious reasons, I would like to get to the various I/O devices

have precise information on the location and protocol of the I/O
ports on this critter?  Disassembling the BIOS is beginning to

A usually reliable source recently told me that Northstar will soon
announce a new 16-bit CPU for the Horizon.  Also a new 5 1/4 Winchester
with 15 Mbyte capacity.

He also said Northstar will soon offer a new release of Northstar BASIC
that runs under CP/M. (Its about time!)  Maybe Northstar BASIC will get
a new lease on life.  Lots of good programs were written in that BASIC
in the early days of micros, that is, 1975-1979.

Can anyone confirm or deny the above?

daisy-wheel printers, but if I select them I cannot customise further.
Also, the Osborne manual I have (does not mention WS version #) lists
some locations to change (PSHALF: and PSFINI:, I think, for half-line feed
and exit re-initialization) that INSTALL cannot find.
At the very least, if I cannot have proportional spacing, can I get
sub- and super-scripts?
Any help will be appreciated.

I was at the Trenton Computer Fair last weekend and
was very impressed by a talk one of the speakes gave
on public domain software for CP/M.  I have a Heath 
H100 which runs CP/M-85 and apparently there is a guy
in Pennsylvania that will supply Heath format 5.25"
soft sectored floppies for any programs in the New
York Amature Computer Club public domain library for
$6.00 each.  This is a great deal, execpt that there
are 200 disks in the NYACC library.

Has anyone had experience with the public domain 
software provided by NYACC (or any other club)?
Which programs are worthwhile getting?  I have seen
several utilities, such as wash and dump which are
"musts", but there is tons of other stuff.  I would
appreciate getting anyone's opinions on these programs.
I have a catalog, and will summarize any information
I get to the net.

Also, does anyone know what is the latest version of
MODEM7?  The NYACC catalog lists a couple of dozen
different versions, ranging from 7.0 to 7.96 to 7.6.
MODEM7.6 appears to be the most recently dated (April,
1982), but I am not sure.  Any help here would be
appreciated.

Thanks in advance.

Iam a little late late replying to your request due to some problems with my mail
server.

I seen demo's and talked to the people at Carousel.  The system I saw the demo
on was an S-100 with a semi-disk the package seemed very fast. The
documentation was complete.   The people who wrote the code are part of the
group that did  LBL Software Tools.  The Software Tools are in public domain
and are available from the Software Tools Users Group.  But the port to a CPM
system is going to be a long project.  On the whole I think the Carousel software
is the way to go.

Article-I.D.: houxm.381
Received: from Usenet.uucp by SRI-Unix.uucp with rs232; 23 Apr 83 3:04-PST

Is there a convention for handling I/O device status in CP/M?  I have a DEC
Rainbow 100 equipped with CP/M-86 and regular CP/M 2.2, and a printer port with
handshake, a vt100 terminal emulator, and a communications port tied to the
CP/M paper tape reader/punch.  Only the keyboard has a CP/M status indicator
(BDOS call #6 with magic code 0feH returns non-zero if a keyboard character
has arrived).  I have found an 8088 address (0:02b4bH) that contains a count
of characters that have arrived and not been processed on the comm. port (paper
tape reader).  I have not been able to find any similar flagging of when the
display is ready to receive another character (only a problem on "clear
screen" at 9600 baud or faster), or when the comm. port (paper tape punch) can
accept another character, or when the printer can accept another character (a
real problem, since printers are usually very slow).  My port of YAM to the
Rainbow sometimes screws up the display in vi and emacs at 9600 baud, and
cannot handle the printer at all (CP/M hangs in BDOS call #5 and loses
characters from the comm. line).  Bugs easily fixed if the status indicators
were there to test.  Questions:
A. Does anyone know how to test for: display ready, comm. line ready, or
printer ready on the Rainbow ?
B. Assuming I find out how to test these status indicators, how should CP/M be
patched to present them ?  Another magic code to BDOS call #6 ?  Additional
BDOS calls ?  or should I just add additional BIOS jump table entries ?  or is
it hopeless, and only direct I/O kludges should be used in the programs ?
C. How did this situation come about ?  Isn't CP/M a mature system able to
support even these simple, fundamental things ?  How does MS-DOS handle I/O
device status ?        Mel Haas  ,  houxm!mel

Believe it or not, there is now a way to run CP/M progras under UNIX (and, for
that matter, VMS, RSX, RT, and some others). Two ways, really--one simulated
(slow but it works) and one hardware. The Virtual Microsystems Z-Board is
now running under UNIX, and is quite nice. I programmed it. I know. Any

Subject:  Communications program info wanted

I would like to be able to access all the goodies available on MIT-MC.
I have an Osborne I, and am running the PLINK program from MC, which enables
me to transfer text files (not binary).  I can ftp from MC to my local host.
Question:
	which files should I get to enable me to up/download arbitrary
files from my local host (VAX780/Berkeley UNIX4.1) to the Osborne?
I believe there are various flavors of a program called MODEM which fit
the bill.  I also presume I will need a program to run at the host end
(I think UMODEM, but I am not sure).  BAsically, which files should I
download from MC in order to accomplish transfers (a mated pair, one for
VAX, one for Osborne)?  .ASM files would be my best bet, but .HEX is
probably OK for the Osborne, and C/pascal for the VAX.  .COM files are out.
Any info will be appreciated.

To transfer files between a unix system (any flavor, v7 and up) and
your osborne, you need a) some flavor of the modem program that has
been configured for the osborne (you can find this in the archives),
and b) a program for unix that implements the same protocol. There are
2 unix modem programs out there. Umodem, which I didn't write. It has
tons of options and is a @i(large) piece of code - also, I have been
told by someone that they tried to use compile it on their flavor of
unix, and it didn't work.

There is also Tmodem, which is my program. It is a program in the unix
style - it does one thing (transfer files), and it does it well. It
will send files up or down and that's it. Two options. It is meant to
transfer binaries from unix to cp/m. It has been under heavy use by a
number of people, and I've ported it to everything from a vanilla v7
to berkeley 4.1. (I like my programs (biased, but such is life.).) If
you need help with Tmodem, ask me. I'm here.

Since I am new to the CP/M set, I am curious about the status of the

directory?  Would you make yourself know to me, please?  My immediate
application is to dump the "good" (ie, working) material out to magtape
in order to prepare disks at somewhat higher than 1200-baud speed.
I have Z-80, 8088, MC68000 systems running a number of different

I have Unix on the 68000.  I would appreciate help in this.  Thanks.

I've been having the same type of questions in mind as those asked by Ken Lee

see all sorts of messages about publicly available CP/M software, and get pages
full of cryptically named programs whose gibberish names (to me, at least)
convey no meaning.  Can anyone enlighten me, or do I have to spend about
$120 to get the NYACC catalogs to find out what's available.  I'd sure appreciate
an abbreviated summary of the types of things that I could get, the identities of
the latest versions, the most useful ones, etc.  Maybe that's either not possible, or
it's too large an order.  Please say so if that is the case.  If it is perhaps someone

he intends to  charge for it (the manuals are LARGE and would
have to be distributed on disks since printing a couple hundred
page manuals wuld require that he charge far t oo much)"

You are perpetrating a misconception that is hard on those of us with slow
printers.  Example:   According to an earlier message, the complete ZCPR2
documentation is 420 pages.  I just called a randomly chosen local quick-print
shop, who will offset print and bind 200 copies of a 500-page (250 two-sided
sheets) 8 1/2" x 11" book from camera ready copy for $12.00 per book.  This price
could be driven lower by higher quantities and/or by finding a hungrier
printer.  The "LARGE" manual is actually less than 1" thick, printed double
sided on good 20# paper.

You would need about six 8" SSSD disks to distribute this same documentation, at
a cost of about $15.00, not counting duplication charges and label printing. 
Office overheads are probably about the same either way, except for the extra
storage space (10 cubic feet) for the paper version.  Either way, office overheads
and a small profit would presumably double the costs mentioned above, and a
full commercial profit would add another ~50%.  UPS shipping to the customer
would add a few dollars to the customer's cost, still leaving the printed version a
bit cheaper.

While this is not fancy "professional" formatting, printing, and binding it is
better than what would result from a "do-it-yourself" printing job by an average
customer working from a distribution disk.

To:  info-cpm@brl-bmd.arpa

I finally got around to writing to Carosel. They sent me a four page
flyer (dated March 1983) with lots of useful information. Major fetures:

61 ultility programs, a versatile command interpreter (shell), a
consistent way to access all the tools, the ability to redirect tool
input and output, a feature that transmits data between tools (pipe
simulations), and a better way to organize your file directories
(simulated hierarchical directories).

The tool kits come in two flavors, the Build-a-ToolKit, and
Use-a-ToolKit.  The former is the more complete and expensive, the
latter smaller and cheaper.

Stated requirements: CP/M 2.2, 64K-bytes of memory (for optimum
performance), Two 8-inch floppy disk drives, Microsoft's Fortran-80 if
compiling tool sources from the Build-a-ToolKit is desired (no version
of Fortran-80 is specified).

Prices: Carousel ToolKit Manual for CP/M 80 (338 page manual with a
beginner's introduction to using the tools on CP/M, tutorials, and
detailed descriptions of each command and library routine), $40.00 (this
does not seem to be good for any credit on a later purchase).

Carousel Use-a-ToolKit (manual, license, 3 diskettes with 61 tools in
binary form) $249.00

Carousel Build-a-ToolKit (everything from the above plus 6 diskettes
with the tool sources, the linkable library, ratfor, and the associated
tool-building tools) $395.00

Additional licenses for single user/machine $40.00

They will pay shipping if prepaid by check or money order. California
sales tax collected where apppropriate.

This looks like a good deal, since the shell functions alone would cost
on the order of $150 for something like the MicroShell (no brosure
handy).  I am certain I have the price wrong for that but I am not too
far off.

I don't feel like typing the descriptions of all 61 tools. Write
Carousel MicroTools, Inc.  at 609 Kearney Street, El Cerrito, CA 94530
for more info. (415) 528-1300 is their phone number.

more or less what can or cannot go wrong with it.

Incidentally, they have found a m ajor bug in the 68000 board at

should swap them out when they've got the bug fixed.

For the past few months, I have been trying to locate public
domain source for the MODEM protocol in Z80, preferably one
that includes CRC's.  I am trying to integrate the protocol
into the upload/download part of a bulletin board system
running on TRaSh-80 models I/III.

I need the source to be able to apply the necessary front-end
and eliminate the unnecessary terminal-type commands. I need
the Z80 flavor since I don't have an 8080 assembler.

If you know of anyone that has the source or know someone that
I might contact, I would *REALLY* appreciate the help. If I
have to program it myself, it won't get done, which would be
too bad since this board is going to be widely distributed.

I can be contact at the above netaddr for those with arpa
access or zza_a116.jhu at UDEL-RELAY for CSNet. Also, PO Box
1577, Baltimore MD 21203.  I'll repay postage/disk for anyone
who sends me the source.

I think if your budget will allow it you should order all 7 volumes of
the NY Club's catalogs.  I bought them at the computer fest and wasn't
sorry.  It's amazing to look through them and see the wide diversity
of things in the public domain.  After you get the catalogs and decide
on some things you want, check the MIT-MC CPM; directory first for
more recent versions, then order.  One nice thing about public-domain
programs is that if they're good ones they seem to be well-maintained
(i.e., updates/fixes/features added, etc.).  For instance, MDM7xx
(a.k.a. MODEM7xx) has gone through MANY revisions (most for the
better) and some people have taken the attitude that they're tired of
getting the newest versions of that program.  I don't see it that way
at all - personally I would want to make sure I ALWAYS had the latest
version, just to make sure I didn't miss out on some nice new feature.
You'd be amazed at how many people don't know, for instance, that
there's a very large printer buffer available in the terminal mode.
That feature has been in there for a number of revisions, but some
users are so far behind they don't have it.

Believe it or not, there is now a way to run CP/M progras under UNIX (and, for

(slow but it works) and one hardware. The Virtual Microsystems Z-Board is
now running under UNIX, and is quite nice. I programmed it. I know. Any

The Epson Qx-10 is as nice a set of hardware as I have seen for
the money.  I am told that it is available with CP/M.  I do not
have CP/M for it.  I have TPM and VALDOCS.  Those are designed
by semi-geniuses for use by semi-idiots.  In theory I have the
poroduction software, but whenevber I call them about things,
they tell me they have another upgrade, and they will be
preoviding upgrades to prevous purchasers.
	If you know little about computers and do not want to
learn much, the VALDOCS system may well be what you need.  It is
a combined text editor, calendar, memo pad, and stuff like that,
all worked from inside the text editor.
Problem is it is SLOW SLOW SLOW SLOW SLowwwwww in disk ops, and
for that matter they work the poor little Z-80 so hard that it
is SLOW writing to the screen.  I do not know whether that is
VALDOCS or inherent in the QX-10.  I do know that if you watch
the screen when you use the system, you will go mildly mad, as
it is a full half second or so behind you (single user).
	There's much to like about the machine, especially the
hardware, but I got a feeling they really need more work on the
software.  I do not know what terminal the QX-10 emulates when
it's in CP/M and not running VLADOCs.  It is a bit-mapped screen
thouggh, so they can put up BOLDFACE and italics and like that
right on screen (and with the Epson Fx-80 printer actually print
it, too...)

Subject: Language Translator query
To:   info-cpm@brl.arpa

I need some help putting together a quick and dirty translator
for a basic-like application language (custom language).

The langauge will have commands similar to those of Basic including

                           GOTO xxx

where xxx is a label on one of the commands in the "program" being
translated.

Most of the other commands are straight forward sorts which begin with
a command name and may have some arguments separated by commas:


              COMMAND-NAME  arg1, arg2, ...

where most of the arguments are numeric, symbolic, or selector
(e.g. YES | NO) type things.

Some fo the arguments will be multiline text literals.

What I am looking for is any code that I could hack into
a reasonable translator for this language.  By the way,
the output of the translator will be an intermediate
form representation of the input suitable for interpretation
by a runtime package.

I am hoping to write the translator in C (BDS or Lattice) but would
go with some other language if I found a very nice box of code
to hackup.

All suggestions will be aprreciated.  Please send them directly to
me (jeffrey@office).

thanks very much,

Just out of curiosity, in what field did you receive your PhD?
(Or is it an M.D.?)

I am certain there is much latent curiosity around the net.

Subject: New ZCPR2 files
To: INFO-CPM@brl.arpa

The new ZCPR2 files Rick Conn just announced are now available
in AR84:CPM;  We would appreciate it if you accessed them there
instead of the previously-announced location, in order to avoid
accidents while FTPing.  The AR84:CPM; location is actually a
"LINK" to the other one, so will be identical.  Because of directory
storage limits many of the files in the CPM; directory are actually
LINKs to files stored in other directories.  We've got a lot of
great things on-line.  See CPM;CPM DIRLST for a complete listing.
