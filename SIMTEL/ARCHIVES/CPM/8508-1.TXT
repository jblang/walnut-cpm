I'm currently using the 360K version of Westwind's Drive C on my Osborne 1.
It  works  as  advertised  and  enormously  speeds up any program that does
overlay swapping from disk (Wordstar is vastly  improved).  It  also  comes
with  a  version  of  Supercalc  2  that uses the RAMDisk for virtual core,
allowing truly enormous spreadsheets.  I haven't had time to test this yet.
I  haven't  encountered any bugs as yet, nor heard of any from anyone else.
It does take about a minute to load from floppies when booting,  but  all's
clear  sailing  from  there.  The drive includes software that allows it to
act as a print buffer and RAMDisk simultaneously.

Drive C costs about $650 in the 360K version.  I thought it was  worth  it,
others may not.  I haven't tried it with dBase II yet, but did use dBase II
with a RAMDisk on an IBM PC.  It makes an enormous difference in speed  (at
least  10x)  over  floppy disk operation.  On the other hand, no difference
was detectable over hard disk operation.

Last I heard there was no dBase  II  compiler,  but  there  was  a  version
available  from Ashton-Tate specifically for people in your position.  It's
a subset of dBase II that allows your command files to be run, but  doesn't
give  the  user  access  to  the  dBase command level.  I'm not sure if the
source is accessible from other text editors with this  version.  I  expect
A-T will be happy to tell you about it (and sell you a license).

Adding a Real Time Clock to a micro can be somewhat of a hassle, to say the
least.  The OKI 5832 is best interfaced thru a PIA, the National 58174 and
58274 chips have faster access times but still require wait states.  OKI,
however, has recently introduced a new RTC chip, the MSM6242RS, that is
designed to be directly interfaced to the sytem bus of Z80, 8080, 8085,
8086/8, 6800, 6502, etc. processors without the need for wait states.  It
has several neat features such as <30 microamps current draw (<10 microamps
in standby mode), +/- 30 seconds adjust, automatic leap year correction,
12/24 hour modes, and year/month/day/day of week in addition to hours/min/sec.

I have one running on my 4 MHz Z80 system now - extremely easy to interface!
The only problems were in setting the 12/24 hour mode correctly and sometimes
BUSY would never go low after once setting HOLD high.  Here are the fixes:
 To read the clock registers, you set the HOLD bit and wait for BUSY to go low.
 If it does't go low within 190 usec, reset HOLD and try again. (You'll fail on
 the first try only once per 36000 tries.)  The data sheet is not too clear on
 how to set the 12/24 hour modes.  To set 12-hour mode, output 01H, then 00H to
 Ctl Reg F.  To set 24-hour mode, output 05H, then 04H to Ctl Reg F.

If you need a RTC, check this one out. 

I have no connection with OKI Semiconductor, just a satisfied user of a good
part that I hadn't heard about until 4 days ago.  They should do a better
job of letting the world know about the 6242.

cc: INFO-MODEM7@SIMTEL20.ARPA

I recently tried using the adaptive dialing mode of my ProModem where
it is possible to determine if tone or pulse is necessary.  I have a 
tone line (on GTE, sigh...), and the call appeared to make the central
office think I was trying to make a "0" prefixed call, such as credit
card or whatever.  The funny "bong" tone appeared followed shortly by
a baffled operator.  Has anyone else had similar experiences, or can
someone offer advice on how to use the ProModem in this mode.  Normal
tone dialing works fine.

Thanks in advance,

Dave,

I use an ordinary hole-punch to punch out the extra index holes.  I use
the jacket of a bad disk as a template.  As a caution, the hole-punch
could be magnetized, so disks should be formatted after this treatment.

Use flippies only for archival disks, not  work disks in a floppy-only
system.

Sorry, as far as I know, Apple runs CP/M-80 (for a Z80, the eight-bit
"original" CP/M).  IBM runs CP/M-86, the sixteen-bit version.  I know
that CP/M was intended to create a "standard" such that the same program
will run on many different machines.  The catch is that CP/M-80 and
CP/M-86 are two DIFFERENT operating systems (only the names (and the
user interface) appear similar).  To get the same program to run on
two machines w/ direct transfer they both have to have the same CPU
(both the Osborne and the Kaypro have a Z80 (I think) and run the
eight-bit CP/M).  If you have the source code for whatever program
you want to transfer, in a high-level language, you can re-compile
on the IBM.  NOTE: Z80 assembler code is NOT suitable for compilation
on the IBM.  You need a language like C, Pascal, FORTRAN, or even 
BASIC.  Does this answer your question?

I recently ran across a program that purported to take a standard M80
symbol table (that normally contains only external references) and 
modify it to contain internal tags.  This would be a great boon to
SID/ZSID debugging.  Unfortunately, I can't remember where I saw it.  
If anyone out there has access to it or knows were it can be found, I
would appreciate the info.

David, I think your problems are due to poor analog design/phone line
interface in your modem.  I went through two USR Passport modems and had
all sorts of garbage characters, random phone line hang up, etc.  At
first I thought I had a bad modem, so I exchanged it for another Passport.
It acted the same way.  It was then I concluded the design of the modem
did not meet my standards so I traded it in on a Rixon R212A.  Calling
the same BBS's I did with the Passport over the same phone line I now have
no problems at all with bad characters, etc.  While USR modems work well
from the microprocessor side, their phone line interface is poor.

Netlandians,

A library file called LOCK.LBR was recently installed at SIMTEL20's
MICRO archives, shortly thereafter followed by a horrible bug warning
message (also in that archive).

I did some testing, disassembly, etc. (the source code will be available
shortly when I'm done - I DO believe in Public Domain source being released).
Only problem I can discover is:
If you LOCK a file twice, you gotta UNLOCK it twice!  LOCK properly
labels its locked files with an ASCII "Locked File" warning, but unfortunately
does NOT look at that warning (or maybe the author didn't WANT to check
that warning to permit double-LOCKing), and will gleefully lock the LOCKed
file again!  (Darn, forgot to check what happens if you LOCK twice using two
different keywords!)

Anyway, test results:  If you LOCK a file once (any kind of file), you can
UNLOCK it just fine with the same keyword.

If you LOCK a file twice (SAME keyword both times), you can UNLOCK it just
fine (using the SAME keyword both times).

Could not make it crash given the above circumstances.

Incidentally, LOCKing algorithm is quite simple - uses the scrambled buffer
toward the end of LOCK.COM against the target file data.  It ADDs the two
values, ANDs in 55H, does a RLCA, XORs it with another pointer character,
and then stuffs it away.

Try Turbo Toolbox from Borland International (same folks who sell Turbo
Pascal).  Turbo Toolbox is a set of Pascal routines (in source) that
implement ISAM files using B+ trees.  Cost about the same as for Turbo
Pascal.

From the algorithm described, I would assume that locking twice, with
different keywords could be undone, using the same two keywords IN
REVERSE ORDER (i.e.: if locked with "dead" then "bolt", unlock with
"bolt" first then "dead"....)   It MIGHT work unlocking with "dead"
then "bolt"....but I wouldn't want to bet on it.....  BTW:  can
you "unlock" a file that has not been locked....if so, can you recover
the data (perhaps  by "locking" it?).

I'm depressed.

I've been attempting to determine just how I can best upgrade my 
office computer.  (I work in a U.S. Army RDT&E organization.)  I 
thought I was in good shape when the Army signed a open contract 
to buy Intel 310 systems, but there is a problem.  To get the 
capability I want, I need to spend over $50k if I go with the 
equipment listed on the (mandatory!) Army contract.

I have a fairly good idea that the capability I want is available 
for much less than the aformentioned $50k - but I don't know 
quite where.  Therefore, I would like to solicite responses from 
anyone of what I should mention as alternatives to my puchasing 
agent when I go in to fight the mandatory part of the contract.  
I need names, addresses, specifications, prices and everything 
else available to get the best available system that meets the 
requirements and is the least expensive.  (I'm a taxpayer too!)  
I just don't believe the 310 is it.

The remainder of this message contains what I am using now, my 
upgrade requirements, what I have to buy from the Intel contract 
to meet those requirements, and some possible alternates to the 
Intel system.

My current system consists of a NorthStar Horizon w/18M HD, 5 
Televideo terminals, a NEC printer, a IDS dot-matrix printer and 
a Hayes modem.  It is running a multi-user OS ('TSS/C' - probably 
quite close to MP/M) with WordStar, dBase II, Mex, and SuperCalc 
as the main applications software.  This system meets my require-
ments except in the following areas: it is too slow under load [5 
users on one Z80!], does not have enough user terminals [has 5, I 
need 8], the disk space is marginal [has 18M, I want ~30-40M), 
and communication with remote systems is awkward [I had to hack 
it badly to get it to work at all].

The two printers and modem will be used on the new system - if I 
can also use the 5 terminals that would be even better.  The 
Horizon main frame and HD I suspect must go.

Requirements (in order of priority)
     1) must run WordStar, dBase, and SuperCalc (I had enough 
trouble training my people in these, I don't want to start over!)
     2) shared files (single-user access to any r/w file, locked 
to other users until released, multiple access to any r/o file.)
     3) queued output to 2 printers
     4) two multiple access commo ports to the outside world - 
one 9600 baud direct connect, one dial-up.  (dial-IN access NOT 
required!)
     5) adequate processing speed for all users (TSS/C's major 
problem is speed - I will buy all the speed improvement I can.)
     6) 8-simultaneous users (single-tasking ok) with access from 
each user's desk.  Reset of 'hung' users w/o system reboot.
     7) 3MegBytes HD storage per user, not including system and 
program storage.  (I figure a minumum of 30M, 40M desired.)
     8) Tape backup system for HD

Note that my current system satisfies the first 4 items above; I 
will not accept a 'new' system that does less that the above even 
if it does that faster!

Intel 310 configuration:
     The basic problem with the 310 is that it is a UNIX box and 
cannot satisfy #1 above in multi-user.  Therefore, one needs to 
run the applications at the workstations, not in the central box 
- and that means using pc's.  (The Wyse 1100 pc is included in 
the contract for just this purpose.)  To satisfy #2 above, the 
pc's must be netted to the central HD via a network of some type.  
So, the configuration looks like:
     8 Wyse 1100 pcs @ $1,926 (IBM-clone, 265k, 2 floppies)
     8 Personal Network Interface Interface Unit @ $1,650 (this 
board connects the pc to the OpenNET LAN, the cheaper NIC steals 
memory from the pc stopping it from running dBase)
     9 10 foot Transceiver Cables @ $70 (+ $15/10 foot over 10')
     1 10 port Intellink @ $1,695 (central node on LAN)
     1 Intel 310 4-user @ $11,245 (4-user includes 80286, 1MRAM 
and 40MB HD, smaller systems don't)
     1 Ethernet commo controller @ $1,795 (connects 310 to LAN)
     1 Tape subsystem on expansion chassis @ $3,339
The total (includes transportation and installation but WITHOUT 
SOFTWARE) is $45,617.  A 'OpenNET' configuration is slightly 
more expensive than the 'Intellink' configuration cited above.  
Software would easily push it over $50k as one needs 8 copies of 
WordStar, dBase and SuperCalc.

As I see it, a TurboDOS or similar system (NorthStar Dimension?) 
that has multiple processors would be best for this application.  
Something on the order of (pure guesses on the $ amounts):
     Main Frame/HD/master processor - $5,000
     Tape drive added to main frame - $1,000
     16-bit slave processors - 8 x $1,500
     RAM disk for speed - $2,000
     3 more terminals - 3 x $700
Comes to a total of 'only' $22,100 w/o software.  That's less 
than HALF the above and does the same thing.  (except run UNIX, 
but running UNIX is a nonrequirement.)

So, anyone have any ideas of what and where I could get something 
better rather than spending $50k of 'your' money?  Please reply 
directly to rbloom@apg-1, I will synopsize results and post 
later.  This is strictly a request-for-information and does not 
obligate anyone for anything and does not represent nor indicate 
U.S. Army policy.  Names used above are copyright somebody else.

Does anyone have a 'quotable' specification for an acceptable sound level
for an office environment?  By quotable, I mean a MIL standard, OSHA spec,
or the like that I can plug into a military Request for Proposal.  We all 
instinctivly know what we can live with, but firm dB levels seem hard to
come by.  Minimum I need are noise levels, but any other (like levels at
specific frequencies) would be appreciated.

Thanx,
Doug

	The book on ZCPR3, namely ZCPR3: The Manual, is out now, and
it is available from the Library of Computer and Information Science and
the Small Computer Book clubs.  It is also available from Echelon.
	The book is divided into three sections: Using ZCPR3 (detailing
all the commands with chapters devoted to the online documentation system,
menus, VFILER, DU3, and general concepts), ZCPR3 Internals (how the
system works), and ZCPR3 Installation.  The book is 350 pages.  
	If you have questions on ZCPR3 (and all of the softwre in the
the <CPM.ZCPR3> archive on SIMTEL20), the book is a good source.  I wrote
ZCPR3 and the book, so you know where I'm coming from, but I really feel
that the book meets a need.
	The next few issues of Byte (starting in Sept) contain Steve
Ciarcia's column on the SB180 single-board computer, and there is a lot
of ink on ZCPR3 here as well.
	Echelon has just received (from me) a new document on IOPs
(the Input/Output Package concept of ZCPR3), and this adds
another 60+ pages of reading.  You can get a hardcopy from Echelon or
download the document from a Z-Node (see the list on SIMTEL20).
	Finally, the Echelon newsletters (there are over 25 now) provide
lots of information on the evolution of ZCPR3 and changes/bug fixes/new
activities.
	I have written an article for Micro Cornucopia on the operational
concept behind the ZCPR3 Environment Descriptor (which should appear in the
next issue).
	Hopefully, this is enough reading to really start to get the
ZCPR3 concepts across.  The source code to the entire system is on SIMTEL20,
and I will be sending an update soon which will bring the files on
SIMTEL20 up with the latest versions of the software.

I think you have perfectly described a Compupro 816 system (Viasyn as
they are called now). I suggest you contact Gifford Systems (look at a
recent Byte magazine for their number, if you can't, let me know). These
are one of the fastest and most reliable machines on the market.

Subject: dBASE II Question 
Cc: ogasawar%tetra@nosc.ARPA, pasquere%tetra@nosc.ARPA



I have a dBASE II question.  First, the scenario.

File X.dbf contains 100 records.  File Y.dbf contains  0  records
but  has the same definition (i.e., STRUCTURE) as X.dbf.  Someone
inadvertently issues the command:

        . use Y
        . copy to X structure

The result is that the 100 records in X.dbf are still there,  but
because it now has the definition of Y.dbf, X.dbf appears to con-
tain 0 records. Any reference to a record number  in  X.dbf  pro-
duces an error because the definition thinks there are none.

The question: is there any way to fake the  definition  of  X.dbf
into  recognizing  those  100  records?  I tried doing an APPEND,
thinking that when it updated the definition it  would  count  in
the  100 records that were there plus the dummy record I just ad-
ded.  Wrong.  It now says I have 1 record in X.dbf instead of 0.

In the interest of broadening the scope of this discussion, I am 
relaying the following discourse that was found today on the MBBS Central
RCP/M.

To:	All who are interested
From:	David McCord, sysop, ZCPR3 BBS (415) 489 9005
Date:	4 Aug 85
Subj:	yet another opinion

It seems as though many sysops (you know who you are) have an ax to grind
against Irv Hoff.

The various recent notes I have seen on the sysop board and in other places
air a trend I see as undesireable; belittling KMD because they want to
grind their axes against Irv.

I am not attempting to defend whetever real or percieved greivances they
may have against Irv; but I must question their rationale in their
criticisms of KMD and BYE500.

One of the things that not many sysops know is that Irv did not implement
the automatic selection of 1k or 128 byte packets purely on his own
whim.  He was asked to bring forth a xmodem-like program that had
automatic selection of block size by the northern california sysop
organization, PRACSA.  The reason this sysops organization did this was
mainly ease of use for non-technical users.  And, we believed there was
sufficient precedent in the automatic selection of CRC or checksum error
checking modes to warrant automatic selection of block size.  By
"automatic", I mean the user need not use any extra command line
parameters, i.e., simply use "XMODEM S" or "KMD S".

I have seen folks questioning and ridiculing the extra "K" that KMD uses
in the synchronization stage to accomplish the automatic selection of
block size.  However, their comments are never specific, usually
something along the lines of "it sucks".  Personally, I would like
some specific information on why "it sucks", because I have yet to see
any.  In my opinion as a professional telecommunications engineer, I see
nothing wrong with the extra character.  The overhead involved is exactly
one character time at whatever baud rate is being used, no matter how
long the file to be transferred is.  This is hardly inefficient or
undesireable, since the result is a program that is easier to use.

Because the PRACSA sysop organization asked Irv to develop what has resulted
in KMD, most of us are using it.  We will probably go on using it until
we are shown solid reasons why we should not do so.  I do not speak
officially for PRACSA, as I am not an elected officer.  However, I am
quite willing to speak at the next PRACSA meeting on the disadvantages of
KMD, should any be brought out.

Perhaps the only valid criticism of KMD is it's name: it is not XMODEM.
I do not have a problem with this personally, because if you are using
ZCPR3 (as I am), it is quite easy to construct an ALIAS named XMODEM that
passes it's parameters to KMD.COM.  However, for non-Z3 systems, facilities
such as SYNONYM could do this also.  Yet, I do concede this as a valid
"problem" of KMD.

But this leads me to the reason that KMD was named differently than XMODEM.
It is because KMD uses BYE500; XMODEM does not.  Charges have been made 
that Irv is trying to "lock in" XMODEM to systems using BYE500.  Wrong!
Irv has "locked in" KMD to systems using BYE500, NOT XMODEM!!!  Irv has
not, to my knowledge, ever come out and said that everyone can get rid
of XMODEM now that KMD is here.  If someone wants to use XMODEM as a
standalone program, fine.  They have that choice.  But for systems already
using BYE, eliminating the redundancy of both the file transfer program
and BYE both having the same routines makes sense.  And, having used BYE500
and KMD on my BBS, I am quite pleased with the added functionality.  I can
use the BYE function keys when KMD is active, and I get a much more 
informative description of block errors during file transfer than I ever
recieved using XMODEM.  Also, it is quite easy to install.

In summary, I think that the arguing that has been going on has not really
been specific enough regarding why KMD may be an inferior choice; instead
it has been oriented more toward "We don't like Irv, and we're gonna get
him by trashing KMD and BYE500".  The people who are doing this are doing
everyone a disservice, because the pseudo-debating is not addressing the
real issues involved.  We could invest our time better by:

	- informing users as to the merits and demerits of the 1k block
	  in various circumstances,
	- discussing if it is better or not better to have auto selection of
	  1k blocks (regardless of the technique used),
	- discussing if it is possible for any mini- or mainframe based
	  multiuser system to cope with 1k blocks with any increase in
	  throughput, etc.

I plead with all involved to continue debating the issues involved, but to
become oriented to facts and logic, instead of insinuation and emotion.

Enough said! (for now...)

I  have  a Drive C that I use with my Osborne I and I  think  its 
wonderful. To be really useful, it needs to be fairly large. Mine 
is 384K and 512K wouldn't hurt a bit. There is some problem using 
it  with  submit  and with programs that sit up  in  high  memory 
intercepting BDOS calls.    I wouldn't use Wordstar without it.


From dual!cbosgd!ihnp4!tektronix!tekchips!toma  (Tom Almy) 
=================================================================
I  have had about a years experience with a RAM-DISK that I built 
for  my  Lobo MAX-80.  My system has a 5 Mhz Z-80,  two  DSDD  8" 
drives (1.2 meg apiece), and a 256k ram-disk. Operating system is 
CP/M+  with about 32k of sector-buffering.      The buffering  of 
CP/M+  improves  performance  of  random-access  files  (such  as 
databases) to the point that ram-disk offers little  improvement. 
I  put  the utility .COM files and the overlays for Wordstar  and 
KAMAS on the RAM disk.  I also don't trust the RAM-DISK for  data 
files (except read-only, where information is always backed up on 
a Floppy).

If  I could do it again,  I would want to rely on track or sector 
buffering instead of a RAM DISK (since it automatically backs  up 
to  the  floppy),  perhaps with a few hundred K of RAM for  this. 
Then  I  would  want to have a ROM DISK (a RAM  disk  with  27256 
EPROMS)  to hold all my commonly used programs and  overlays.  In 
fact,  the CP/M OS could be loaded of of the ROM DISK eliminating 
the need for a "System Disk".


From nsc!seismo!MIT-MC.ARPA!STORK    (Eric Stork) 
=================================================================
I've used a SEMIDISK for 1.5 years now,  and would not be without 
it. Cost has come down a lot (see BYTE ad). Speed is amazing. For 
example,  to  load dBASEII off a floppy takes about 9  secs.   To 
load  off  RAMDISK  takes <1 sec.!  Assembling long  files  is  a 
pleasure.    I keep about 300k of com files in a library, use the 
rest of the 1 meg for data.   Highly recommend RAMSDISK.


From dual!hplabs!tektronix!reed!elaine 
=================================================================
I  am  using  the boards from SemiDisk systems and  have  had  no 
trouble with them. They make anything disk intensive very fast. I 
run a BBS of of mine and I know that is disk *intensive*.


From dual!ucbvax!sdcsvax!crash!ihom  (Irwin Hom)
=================================================================
My  CP/M system consists of an Apple //e using a PCPI  APPLI-Card 
with  a  128k piggy-back RAM board.  A RAMdisk is  definitely  an 
advantage when running programs that use overlays.  Take WordStar 
for example.  Making the transition from floppies to a hard  disk 
speeded up the menu displays by about 70%.  On the RAMdisk,  this 
increased  to 95%.  Almost instantaneous!          The cost for a 
128k module is about $175.  Two modules can be added to the  PCPI 
card allowing a 192k workspace.  A RAMdisk is worthy when working 
with  programs  that  does  a lot of disk access  with  files  or 
overlays.  Recently,  I've  been  developing  programs  in  Turbo 
Pascal. Saving and compiling files on the RAMdisk is a tremendous 
timesaver.

Subject: RAMDISK AND KEYPAD
For  all  Microsphere  Ram Disk users whose  numeric  keypads  no 
longer  work,  the  problem is not with the ramdisk software  but 
with  the cp/m BIOS.  To provide room in memory for  the  ramdisk 
driver, you had to relocate cp/m using the MOVCPM utility. MOVCPM 
contains a copy of your BIOS as set up by KAYPRO,  which includes 
the  keypad  definitions.  It  would be O.K.  if  you  could  use 
CONFIG.COM  to  reconfigure the keypad,  but  unfortunately  they 
wrote  CONFIG  to  work  only with a 64k  system.  It  should  be 
relatively  easy  for a PASCAL programmer to write a  new  CONFIG 
which would work on any size cp/m.

     WHEN  USING THE MICROSPHERE RAM DISK,  DIRECT ACCESS TO  THE 
PRINTER IS NO LONGER AVAILABLE.  I TRIED USING CONTROL-P TO PRINT 
A SMALL DOCUMENT, AND LATER TRIED USING SELECT WORD PROCESSING TO 
PRINT  A LETTER BUT NO PRINTING WAS STARTED.  WHEN I  INITIALIZED 
DISK  "E" (THOUGH ONLY USED THE FLOPPIES AFTER INITIALIZING)  THE 
PRINTER FUNCTIONED,  SO IT SEEMS THAT THE BUFFER DOESN'T FUNCTION 
INDEPENDENTLY  OF  THE RAM DISK.  THIS WILL RARELY BE  A  PROBLEM 
SINCE I EXPECT TO LOAD SELECT INTO THE RAM DISK MOST OF THE TIME, 
BUT  WHEN  QUICKLY  BATTING  OUT A SMALL  LETTER  AND  USING  THE 
FLOPPIES ONLY, THE RAM DISK MUST STILL HAVE BEEN INITIALIZED.

Subject: D HAWKINS - RAM DISK
I did not understand your message about RAM disk  initialization. 
Specifically  I was puzzled by your comment that EX.COM  wouldn't 
work  to initialize the RAM disk.  I use EX.COM and the following 
NEWRAM.SUB file:
        RDISKM64|  {to initialize the disk}
        YY  {to ask for and confirm reformatting}
        PIP E:=A:*.*|  {to copy files from A:}
        DIR F:|  {to switch to RAM disk => A:}
        ERA ???RAM.SUB|  {to erase SUB files}
        D|
This all works fine.  I have another file, OLDRAM.SUB, which does 
the  same except it does not format the disk.  I use this when  I 
have left my external power supply on and have data on the  disk. 
For  this  reason I do not give either commands automatically  on 
boot -I just issue the EX OLDRAM or EX NEWRAM command from the A> 
prompt.

Subject: RAMDISK & WARM BOOT
If owners of Microsphere's Ramdisk use DIR F: to make the Ramdisk 
drive A, then warm boots will not activate the floppies, nor will 
a new floppy be logged on.  For example,  Software Toolworks C/80 
does  a warm boot after a compile.  If C/80 is in the Ramdisk and 
the latter is set to be drive A,  then the warm boot takes  place 
using the Ramdisk and there is no drive activity. But to log in a 
new floppy, it would be necessary to use DIR F: to return the top 
drive  to being drive A,  do a control C,  access the new  floppy 
(most  likely in drive B),  and then use DIR F:  again to restore 
the Ramdisk as drive A.


From: STEVE WILLETT  To: ALL            Date: 07/11/85
Subject: RAMDISK & WARM BOOT
In  response to Daniel Howard's message about  Microsphere's  RAM 
disk and warm boots I'm sorry,  I have to disagree.  I use DIR F: 
to  set  up  the  RAM disk as drive A:  and it  still  spins  the 
floppies and accesses the top drive every time I do a warm  boot. 
It  may  be a side effect of having a Pro8 machine and/or  having 
ZCPR installed, but it definitely does it.

For those of you who have purchased the Microsphere ramdisk, some 
stimulating news.  Just called Fry's in Sunnyvale  (408-733-1770) 
and  found that (hold onto your seats) they are offering the  NEC 
41256-15  (exactly like the ones on our ramdisks) for $2.99 each. 
Get 'em while they're hot!  More good news. Spoke to Don Thompson 
at Microsphere re the upgrade.  Contra to the instruction manual, 
we don't need to upgrade our 8748 chips--the ones installed  were 
the upgraded versions.  Let's see,  that is 16 x 2.99,  or a 512K 
upgrade  for the princely sum of $47.84 plus tax.  Bought mine on 
Saturday,  plugged 'em in,  did the tests, and all is fine. Since 
mine was configured as 512k with a 32k printer buffer, I now have 
960k available with a 32k printer buffer.    Spoke to the  people

I'm a firm believer in networking micros rather than using a central multi-
user micro with terminals.  You can get a massive increase in performance
and usefulness that way.  I suggest getting a network server with software
and a large hard disk.  Novell software seems to provide the greatest file
and record locking capability of the popular packages and can run on a wide
range of manufacturers' hardware.  You can get cheap PC compatibles and you'll
only need a network interface card (besides the usual stuff) in each.  This
will let you run the software required by your specification.  Some software
has network versions.  Those programs you mention probably do.  Each micro
is also capable of standalone operation in this configuration versus the
central multiuser config.  You should be able to find 8-bit networking
software if you prefer, but since the programs you mention also have 16-bit
versions, you may find more available in that world.

Can anyone point me at a public-domain Z80 cross-assembler that will run on
a VAX under VMS?  It can be MACRO-32, Fortrash, Basic, Pascal, C, or Bliss.

If there's not a PD version, is there a CHEAP one that I can get for Apple

Thanks for any help.

I finally found a copy of XLISP12.COM. Thanks to Dave Giunti for
uploading it to the Computer Language BBS. Unfortunately, it really
BARELY fits in 64k: you run out of memory after typing just a few
expressions (don't even try loading a short program). 

What I will end up doing for the local CP/M group (at least in the
meantime) is using version 1.1 with an INIT  file that will "fake"
ASSOC, PUTPROP, GETPROP, MAPCAR and a few other improtant things.

In case anyone is interested, the CL BBS's number is (415)957-9370.

Also, thank you to all of those who responded offering to help.

Can anyone give me a hint as to how someone would call one program,
say WORDSTAR or something simpler, from within another program.

Methods using Turbo Pascal, 'C' or assembler would be useful.

( Please don't tell me to use AUTORUN, etc. I want to call programs from  )
( within programs, not do batch processing of commands.  		  )

I am new to the S-100 area, and having gotten an old IMSAI chassis with power
supply and motherboard, I am eager to make sure it's up to snuff before I
plug anything else into it. I am getting +11 on pins 1 & 51, +21 on 2, -21 on
52, 0 on the grounds (20,50,70,100) and about 2.3 or 4 everywhere else. Is this
normal? If not, a) is it within acceptability and b) if not, what kinds of 
hints can you-all offer to help fix same? These values were tested WITHOUT 
boards, and I only plan to put in 1-3 boards in for quite a while.

  The name of the above is the PCS-80/15 microcomputer, using the EXP-10
motherboard, and the MBU-B 8085-based CPU. The motherboard also has traces
cut at the terminator at pins 71-74,75 being blank,76-78,79 being reconnected,
and 99. Also, the CPU board has spaghetti and cutouts around U31, a chip with
the label N82S31N 7734 and the label is an S. This chip isn't in the original  
assembly instructions, which is ALL I have.
  Anything of help on this, would also be a godsend.
  I can do without the CPU, but I've got an Advanced Digital SUPER QUAD I can
drop into the motherboard, once it gets working.

The best way to output multiple copies from Wordstar is to utilize Mailmerge
to output your file.  Even if you are not really performing mailmerge
functions, such as customizing form letters, you have the ability to 
specify how many copies you wish to have printed.

there is a neat basic program in simtel that lets you do exactly

the name escapes me and my list is not handy.  it's a library

I haven't tried this but if the file got screwed up the way you say it
did, whynot just reverse the process.  Create a new file with the correct
structure, enter the appropriate number of records (or more, if you must guess)
then copy the correct structure back into your file.  If all you did by
your mistake was change the structure and record number, this should fix 
you up.

    Not being on the INFO-MODEM list, I am not privy to the discussion
    that was mentioned on the message forwarded to INFO-CPM, however
    I do have one question to ask:
       Does this one byte change to the header information (to select
       block size) make KMD incompatible with programs that currently
       support the XMODEM protocol?  Any changes made to a protocol 
       should be made in such a manner that the new editions may still
       work with previous versions, that may not know of the new feature.

    Could somebody please inform me about this?  Does anyone think
    that I have a valid point?  If not, why? ...and, what about Naomi?

  I would have thought that my stance on the wars was quite clear by
now, but at the risk of boring everyone to death, I'm going to state
it one more time.  (Hit Cntrl-O NOW to skip this, if you wish!!).
  At this point there is NO difference between the 1K implementations
except for Irv's additions of another 'receiving handshaking
character' the timing dependent nature of the initial handshake, and
the difference between "S" and "SK".  This is in variance from the
YMODEM standard already implemented on MSDOS and UNIX systems.
  If the CP/M community adopts the KMD/IMP protocol, I think it will
be very unfortunate for two reasons.
  1) It adds complexity, outside of the checksum, to an already shakey
protocol which reduces its suitability for use over timesharing
systems and packet-switching networks.  Also by adding ANOTHER
handshaking character, it continues the bad precedent of the C, and
invites further "improvements" via this extension mechanism, and
further degradation.
  2) The existence of a split between the MSDOS / UNIX & CP/M
impementations helps to ensure that adoption of the 1K packet will not
be widespread, and could hasten the end of XMODEM as a low-end
standard by which everyone can transfer files.  For reasons given in
(1), the M-U world is not going to adopt KMD.  For reasons which I can
only characterize as well-meaning but shortsighted, sections of the
CP/M community have not adopted YMODEM.  As you note, the commercial
protocols have not knocked each other out, but they HAVE kept any one
of them from becoming standard.  CP/M users are now in the minority of
micro users, and it's going to get worse.  I fear that KMD, with its
CP/M Ostrich outlook, will be counter productive to widespread
transfer of data via telecommunications.
  To me, it is evident that these are significant reasons for taking a
strong stand.  I hope it is clear that there is no hidden agenda here.

Not being on the INFO-MODEM list, I am not privy to the discussion
that was mentioned on the message forwarded to INFO-CPM, however
I do have one question to ask:
   Does this one byte change to the header information (to select
   block size) make KMD incompatible with programs that currently
   support the XMODEM protocol?  Any changes made to a protocol 
   should be made in such a manner that the new editions may still
   work with previous versions, that may not know of the new feature.

Could somebody please inform me about this?  Does anyone think
that I have a valid point?  If not, why? ...and, what about Naomi?

I am particular interested in a program that would emulate
a DEC terminal, an have upload/download capabilites.

Thanks in advance.

Re:   Hoff's extensions to the 1k protocol
Date: 8/6/85
From: pst

I am writing this in support of the Hoff extensions to the 1k
protocol.  Separately, Paul Homchick and Irv Hoff developed 1k
protocol for XMODEM.  Irv called his new program KMD, Paul kept the
XMODEM line going.

Many of you know me personally, and know that Irv and I have a
complementary/competitive attitude towards our respective programming
projects.  This should make my comments reasonably objective.

I have tried every XMODEM protocol program available for CP/M and
--MANY-- MS-DOS programs, and they are all (except for one exception)
completely compatible with the Hoff extensions.

	1) The Hoff extensions work.

	2) They work well. [i.e. they are transparent to non-compatible
	   programs]

	3) If you are running IMP,  1k protocol transfers become automatic.

	4) It is my dream that Ron Fowler add the extensions to Mex115, but
	   that's up to him.

I think this all-arround competition has brought about some really
nice additions to RCP/M software.

		1) The Christensen/Forsberg/Hoff 1k protocol
		2) The Hoff extensions to the 1k protocol
		3) The Traina Bye-BDOS calls in Bye337

Unfortunately, we have a disadvantage now.  There is great confusion
about XMODEM/BYE3 and KMD/BYE5.  The problem is that these sets of
programs are functionally identical (or will be as soon as the
Hoff/Masters team releases BYE501/KMD04 which use my Bye-BDOS idea).
There are minor differences between the XMODEM/BYE3 and KMD/BYE5
series, but they are identical from a user's standpoint.  We have
programs that are duplicates, the next step is to merge the best of
XMODEM/BYE3 and KMD/BYE5 into a single group of programs again.

However, none of us (the authors) should be the ones to make the
merge, because we have different ideas all want things done our _own_
way, which was one of the causes of the "big split" to begin with.

I will be more than happy to assist some individual in merging this
software, but I will not do it myself, because I feel it would just
continue the split between KMD/BYE5 and XMODEM/BYE3.  Any volenteers?

I am not an assembler programmer, so am not too sure about my comments,
but---

The Zenith Z100 (not the Z150 Z100 PC) has CPM on an 8085 as well as
msdos.  Therefore, I would think that the assmebler instructions that
come with that machine would have the 8085 version.  If you can't get
it closer, I probably have it somewhere in the documentation that came
with my machine.  Or talk to a Heath/Zenith dealer.

Does anyone know if any vendors are working on S-100 boards using the
new Hitachi HD64180 microprocessor?

It seems like a natural for either CP/M Plus or Z-system. It runs 8080
or Z-80 machine code, has on-chip serial I/O, DMA controller, and
programmable timers, and memory management for a 512K memory address
space. It should reasonably make a single board computer and a full-feature
S-100 bus board with RAM, ROM, serial I/O, and a floppy disk controller.

Yes, I have heard rumors which I believe to be true about Quadram
coming out with an S-100 board which is based on the 64180.  It is running
the Z System, and I am supposed to see it in a month or so.  More on that

That person is not on the net.  However, the various versions of XMDM
(XMODEM) have been merged and are now available as:

Filename			Type	 Bytes	 CRC

Directory MICRO:<CPM.RCPM>
XMDM116.LBR.1			BINARY	 99200  D27AH

The various versions ARE compatible with MODEM2, MODEM7, MODM700, MEX,
YMODEM (YAM), etc.  However, the receiving end if assembled to use
Hoff's "C" pause "K" approach may cause the sender to time out one or
two times, making some people think the protocol is broken.  This only
happens on the first record - after that the receiving end sends
ACK/NAK as the case may be.

Then you said 'The new "K" addition opens the door for expanding into
tomorrow's technology, by replacing the "K" with say a "N" for 9600
baud use with say 2k or even 4k packet sizes.".  Sorry, I frowned so
much reading this that my eyebrows touched in the middle.

Thank goodness Charlie Strom jumped in saying " Since these characters
are not in the error-detection routine ... don't you have any concern
that adding still more possibilities will make the protocol more
fragile?"

You blew me away with your reply: "None whatsoever, Charlie, you (and
Ron Fowler) are likely overlooking the fact those protocol characters
are never sent once the first record is sent.  There is no more
liklihood that would be "more fragile" than the current method of
requiring a "C" or "NAK" prior to the first record being sent, in my
evaluation."

Gad, I'm getting to the point where no matter how much I want to do
all this via CIS, I'm tempted to call you on the phone and scream!
How can you not see, that the addition of characters that aren't
checked, is not opening the door to more and more errors!  I curse
myself for initially doing single-char ACK/NAK/EOT.  Then the opening
<nak> was invented by someone (who?) - and not a bad idea.  "C" naking
was a hack, and obviously it doubled the chances of having the
"protocol selection" hosed up, i.e. a 'glitch' that looks like a C or
a NAK; now a glitch that looks like a C or nak or K, is bad.  You seem
to think adding "N" and more chars is "perfectly OK". If you'd said "I
realize 'K' naking is a HACK, and while it opens the door to more
problems, the benefits far outweigh them", THEN I'd be on your side,
and Fowler and Homchick wouldn't be calling me to beg me to take the
"anti-K side".

I am willing to "bless the K-nak", as yet another hack whose side
effects are not significant enough to warrant throwing it away.
Please just don't smoke whatever you smoke when you rationalize that
it is GOOD, and extendable into the future!  It may not make YOUR
brain hurt, but it sure makes MINE hurt!

Subject: What are the Simtel20 Archives
Date: 13 Aug 85 09:05:30 EDT (Tue)
From: Jeff Edelheit <edelheit@MITRE.ARPA>

It seems that it is time to run this blurb again for the benefit of the newer
Usenetters.  For those of us who have seen this note before, I appologize for
cluttering-up your inbox.

"How can a user of a USENET host access the public domain
microcomputer software collection on the DDN/MILNET host
SIMTEL20" is being asked with increasing frequency as that
software collection continues to grow.  Unfortunately, direct
access is not possible as there is no UUCP gateway for file
transfer between SIMTEL20 (running TOPS-20) and a USENET host (as
there is for electronic mail).

(DDN, formerly known as ARPANET, is the Defense Data Network.
DDN, along with Arpanet, SATNET, SRINET, etc. are all members of 
a TCP/IP protocol-based, multiple gateway network called InterNet.)

USENET has been built on adjacent hosts voluntarily agreeing to
store-and-forward relatively short messages across the USENET
over dialup lines at 300 or 1200 bps.  In the past, helpful InterNet
users would fetch the file(s) requested and then e-mail them to
the requestor.  However, it has been pointed out that large file
transfers disrupt the service, delay the shorter messages, and
generate unacceptably large phone bills, all of which add up to
threaten the tenuous connections that some USENET hosts can
barely afford to have.  Therefore, we have been asked to
encourage InterNet users not to pass archive programs this way.

Now for the good news.  Some InterNet users, if sent a suitable disk,
will download files and return mail the floppy to the requestor.
To find a friendly InterNet user, send a message to INFO-CPM at DDN
host AMSAA.ARPA via net.micro.cpm identifying your disk format and 
your request.  Usually, someone will respond and come to your aid.
If not, don't be bashful, wait a week and try again.  But please
remember, any such arrangements are strictly between you and your
respondent.  This is not, repeat NOT, a service of either the InterNet
or INFO-CPM.

If the above arrangement is inconvenient, or doesn't work, here
are several other sources for public domain software.


----------------------------------------------------------------------

Information (and prices) are subject to change without notice.  A
volume is usually one floppy disk.


1.  CP/M User's Group

The CP/MUG volumes are available from:

  CP/M User's Group
  1651 3rd Avenue
  New York, NY 10028

Current volumes are numbered 1 through 92 at $13 per 8" SSSD disk
(Northstar format also available).  The catalog is $6.


2.  Special Interest Group/Microcomputers (SIG/M)

 The SIG/M volumes are distributed by:

  SIG/M
  Amateur Computer Group of New Jersey, Inc.
  Box 97
  Iselin, NJ 08830

Current volumes are numbered 000 through 172.  The first disk is
$6.00 and $5.00 for each additional disk.  The catalog is $2.


3.  New York Amateur Computer Club

PC-BLUE software volumes for the IBM-PC are available from:

  S-100, CP/M User Group

disk plus $1.50 shipping per order.  California residents add
6.5% sales tax.  Quantity discounts are available.


5. Other sources:

Compuserve Information Service is another source of public domain
software. There are a number of special interest groups (SIGs)
devoted to specific hardware as well as CP-MIG, the generic CP/M
SIG, a repository for a large quantity of public domain software
downloadable by the Compuserve file transer protocol (Christensen
protocol is expected by late summer, 1984). There is no charge for
access to CP-MIG other than the standard CIS connect charges, and
Compuserve can be accessed through their own communications network
or through Tymnet.

... and many Remote CP/M (RCPM) systems around the country, where
software is available for downloading for the price of a phone
call.  The May 1984 issue of Microsystems contains the full listing of
known RCPMs at the time of publication.


I would like to thank Dave Towson, Frank Wancho and Charlie Strom for all
their assistance in putting this blurb together.  If anybody out in InterNet
Land has any questions or comments about the above blurb, feel free to 
contact any one of us.

Hey, this really is serious!  The following is a brief article from
the August 1985 AdaData newsletter:

-----

VLSI Circuits Too Small to Endure?  A report in the June issue of
the Journal of Defense & Diplomacy states that the lightweight
conductors used in very large-scale integrated circuits may be
getting too small to withstand the stresses of carrying current.
JODD says that even the tiny flow of electricity passing through
a chip may be sufficient to displace an aluminum circuit's
individual molecules in the same way that traffic can turn an
uneven roadway into a streat of potholes.  But while the road is
usually able to continue to carry its load, the same may not be 
true of the microscopic conductor, which could actually end up
breaking.  The magazine therefore recommends that military chip
suppliers use heavier metals like tungsten, for which Sandia
National Laboratories (Albuquerque, NM) is developing a two-stage
vapor deposition process.

I'm working on an SB180 board (Steve Ciarcia's design) now.  SUPER board.
This 7 1/2" by 4" SBC has an HD64180, 256K bytes RAM, 2 RS-232C drivers,
1 parallel port, and a floppy disk controller for 3 1/2", 5 1/4", and 8"
floppies.  All running the Z System with a RAM disk.  Clock speed is 6+ MHz.

Note that by using the HD64180, the HD64180 ALONE has 64 I/O ports internally,
providing 2 UARTs (RS-232C line drivers are off-chip), one clocked
serial port, 2 timers/counters, 2 DMA controllers (mem-to-mem,
mem-to-io, and mem-to-mem-mapped-io transfers), and a 12-level
priority interrupt controller.  Most impressive.

Finally, the new Echelon ZAS assembler (a Z System tool) assembles the
extended instructions for the 64180, and the ZDMH debugger helps
debug, recognizing 64180 instructions.  So there is a toolset to
support 64180 development available now as well.

Hi,

I have been given your mailing adress by gubbins@radc-tops20.arpa.



If you have a similar mailing list, could you please include me in it.

I'm a senior in the Technical University of Aachen Medical School and as

we have been hooked into BITNET, I have been volunteered by the German

cp/m ( Sorry, some of my capital keys seem not to work properly) user

group to look into it.



Do you distribute public domaine software ?

If yes, could you send me a list ?

Is it possible to get back issues of your digests ?



Thanks in advance,

Hi, Ron,

I'm afraid your rumors are true.  The 64180 has an on-chip MMU
which provides the memory management.  This is accessed via 
on-chip I/O ports and the special set of 64180 I/O instructions.

I haven't found this to be a problem yet.  SW-wise, you init the
MMU, defining the 64K memory banks to have 0, 1, or 2 common
banks (common to all memory 64K memory banks) and 1 base
bank (unique to each 64K memory bank).  Switching banks is like loading
a segment register, wherein you output any of the standard registers or
(HL) to the MMU for the selection.  The resolution of the common and base
banks is to 4K, but that does not stop you from having a 63K+ TPA.

I really like the 64180, but a problem came up last night which really
bothered me.  One of the two UARTS onchip (which I am using to connect
to a Smartmodem) pays attention to the DCD line.  You can sense this
line internally thru a port.  However, if DCD drops off (no carrier),
then the Transmitter section of the UART is disabled!  Ban news!
No more comm to the Smartmodem for dialing the phone, answering the
phone, hanging up the phone, etc.  You can, of course, set the switch
on the Smartmodem to keep DCD true (reverse logic, so 0 actually), but
then you can't use DCD to detect loss of user signal.

There is a way around this problem for the Ciarcia board, but I can't
talk until Nov or so for reasons of confidence.  Ciarcia
will have a project on this option in Dec Byte.  If Steve says I can
talk earlier, I will.

There is something called DBCompiler.  It's fairly nice, but, last time I
looked at it, it did not have the capability of compiling programs which 
utilized the macro (&) function.  It seemed fairly simple to add this
capability.  It is possible that they have, by now.

Also, a company called Fox & Geller puts out some utilities which, I believe,
include a dBASE compiler.

I know for a fact that there ARE ways to get your dBASE code compiled.  Just
hunt around.

Both AZTEC (MANX) and BDS C support the 'exec' statement or an equivalent,
that allow a program to call another.  

NOTE:  These calls are NOT forks, so you cannot return to the original
program.

I believe both systems supply enough of the source to show how it is done.
(if I remember correctly, the file name of the new program is stored
in the BDOS buffer (?at BDOSBASE+8 (?)), and a couple of pointers need
to be set up pointing to the start and end of the filename.


If this is not enough help, send me mail, and I will try to look up
the details.

I just bought three pieces of Osborne I software (issued by Osborne
itself), hoping to run them on my Kaypro II.  The programs should be
generic CP/M because they do not require bypassing the operating
system.  And yet two out of the three don't work.  Is it the case that
Osborne hobbled its software to prevent it to run on other brands
of machines?  If so, how did they do it?

Note: the software is not the bundled stuff that came with an Osborne.
The two packages are MuSimp/MuMath (Soft Warehouse's symbolic algebra
package), and Bascom (Microsoft's BASIC compiler).  I bought new copies,
still shrinkwrapped, from an Osborne dealer (they were very old stock).
Nothing in the license seems to preclude running on a Kaypro.

Symptoms:

MuSimp: Whenever a "RECLAIM();" is executed, the system crashes.
	Usually the machine locks up, but sometimes it gets a BDOS error,
	indicating some kind of wild jump.
BASCOM:	BASCOM loads and then immediately does a warm boot.

While examining the directory on some Osborne I disks, I noticed a couple
of things that puzzled me.

The first extent of some files (they seemed to be big ones) was
sometimes numbered one, instead of zero (the number of the extent is in
the field named "ex", at offset 12).  Why?  Is this legal?

The record count field was not an exact record count for the extent (nor
could it be). The record count is constrained to be in the range 0
through 128, but an extent can hold up to 256 records.  What are the
rules for resolving this?  The CP/M manual does not seem to discuss this.

How do you tell what all those interesting looking files on Simtel20 are?
Does anyone have descriptions of them?

I'm interested in any public domain languages that might be there.  I
haven't found any yet.

I'm using an Otrona Attache, by the way.  I have a Pascal program
written on an Apple II with UCSD Pascal that I want to run on my
Attache.  It seems a shame to buy a compiler to compile a single
program, but if I can't find any public domain language that is
reasonably similiar to Pascal (even basic would be OK), that's
what I'll have to do.  Any recommendations for a CP/M Pascal?

Thanks!

I also ran into the same problem taking BASCOM from the Os1 to CP/M
on a co-processor board in a Fortune 32:16.  Fix is as follows (and
probably the same for Mu*).

Using ddt (or preferferably zsid) trace execution through the init
sequence of the program.  Very shortly after starting, the program
will jump above 4000H.  trace that code, looking for a section of
about 32 bytes, beginning with a DI (disable interrupts) and
ending with EI (enable interrupts).  This section of code
does a bank switch, and verifies that there is ROM at 0100H.
replace this 32 bytes of code with 00h, exit and save the image.

Works for me.

For the record, Drive B on the Os died again, so I am only using the software
on one CPU (albeit a Z80B, running as a task under UNIX on a 68K).
Who says you can't do what you want?  (The MIMIX (tm) software even
lets me use vi as the replacement for CP/Ms ED.)

The main weakness in the Hoff protocol is the dependence on timing of the
C-K sequence.  If timesharing systems, error correcting modems, and/or packet
switch networks are involved, two characrers sent back to back can arrive at
the other end separated by several seconds, and vice versa.

With the advent of PC-PURSUIT which allows virtually unlimited night calling
within 12 cities local call areas for a $25/month flat fee, these
considerations may be upon us sooner than we think.

The YMODEM protocol, wherein the block size is specified to the sender
(SK for 1k, S for 128) has been in use for several years on a multitude of
micro, mini, and mainframe computers and does not have this weakness.

Working between two sngle process micros, with standard modems and phone lines,
the Hoff protocol works well enough for CP/M use.

a copy of my presentation foils on the HD64180 in:

	MICRO:<CPM.GENDOC>HD64180.WS

While they are sketchy (and designed for a presentation), they contain
a lot of summary information, including the instructions extended beyond
the Z80, how the memory management unit works, how the various interrupt
modes work, etc.

	For those of you in the Dallas area, I'm giving this
presentation tonight (15 Aug) at the Metroplex CP/M Interest Group

Subject:  Microprocessors Unlimited, an extraordinary company:

Fellow hardware hackers - I was interested in some recent postings concerning
Microprocessors Unlimited in Beggs, Oklahoma, (918) 267-4961.  Several readers
have reported very favorably concerning their dealings with this company, and
since I needed some parts, I decided to give them a try.  I telephoned my
order on Friday 9 August, and the parts arrived via UPS Blue on Tuesday the
13th.

     Just placing the order on the phone was a pleasant experience.  The lady
with whom I spoke explained carefully who made each chip, its rated speed, its
price, and what optional parts were available.  After I had made my selection,
she took the shipping and billing information, and then read-back ABSOLUTELY
EVERYTHING concerning the order to verify that she had the correct infor-
mation.  The company prefers to take a credit-card number for their own
protection, but to be paid by check when the merchandise is received.  Thus,
an invoice accompanies the package; and if prompt payment is made, no billing
is submitted to the credit-card company.

     The chips were packed in anti-static carriers, and the group of carriers
were then wrapped in aluminum foil.  A label cautioning the user about static
damage had been affixed to the foil package.  A stout shipping box with
adequate shock-absorbant packing was used.

     Along with the parts, there was a nine-page "newsletter" written by John
Gilchrist, who I presume is the proprietor.  Some of the interesting items:
1. Several portions dealing with static electricity damage to IC's , and how
   to prevent it.  (Microprocessors Unlimited shipping personnel work barefoot
   on a conductive floor mat!)
2. A discussion of the disadvantages of doing circuit development work using
   surplus IC's.
3. A statement that the author believes three Japanese companies - NEC, Hitachi
   and Fujitsu - make the best quality IC's.
4. A brief description of a Mitsubishi 64K DRAM having on-chip refresh.
5. A warning that to avoid damage, 2732A EPROMS must be programmed with 21
   volts rather than the 25 volts used for non-suffix 2732's.
6. Several items dealing with the company's business policies.

     So far, I have not tested any of the material I received.  If I discover
anything further of interest concerning this company, I will post another
message.

For anyone doing ANY work with an S-100 system, especially if it is
an older, possibly not IEEE-696 or even a new Z-100 which is IEEE-696,
you MUST get a copy of the book by Sol Libes and Mark Garetz.
I think the correct title is Interfacing to the IEEE-696/S-100 Bus.
It is very well written and will describe everything you need to know.

It helps if you have a copy of the standard:

IEEE Standard 696 Interface Devices
ANSI/IEEE Std 696-1983

It is Heathkit part number 500-69

A rough draft of the standard was published July 1979 in Computer
(IEEE) magazine.

The standard says the +8 lines (pins 1 & 51) must have an instantaneous
minium greater than +7V, instant max less than 25V and an average
max less than +11V.

The pin 2 is 14.5<16<35V with average <21.5

Pin 52 is the same, but negative.

As far as signals go, high state is +2V or greater on the reciever
end.

If you have an old S-100 system, therer are about 4 lines that have have
been changed, but they were never used much anyhow (Memory write lock,
etc.).

Major concern is the bus termination circuits to prevent ringing and
such.


I am doing a lot of work at home, on the side on a 6 channel stereo
sound/speech Synthesizer/joysticks (both analog and digital types)/
clock-calendar with battery backup and on-chip-leap-year.   The design
is finalized and I am workin on the PC Board layout.  It is completely
IEEE-696/S-100.   So if you have any S-100 questions, I'll take a 
stab at them.

Cheers,
Gern

Aside from the fact that Turbo Pascal provides the function
Execute(FilVar) where FilVar is the name of the program to run, if
you want to be really slick, you could run ZCPR3 and stuff the
name of the file to run (and all of its arguments) into the External
Command line buffer and then exit to the CCP. Next thing running would
be your program. (I have done this from turbo and found the results to
be rather effective.

There was a request about what CP/M based Pascal is suitable for
human consumption.  Turbo Pascal from Borland International comes
about as close to being the public domain software you need as
anything else.  Its low price to performance ratio makes Turbo
Pascal an excellent bargain.  The cleanup necessary to go from
UCSD Pascal to Turbo shouldn't give too much difficulty.

Note that companies that take your credit card number down, even
for a purchase by check, may cause you some problems.  In particular,
these companies often "run" your number (for verification) for the 
amount of the purchase through the credit card authorization computer,
which eats down your available credit even though no actual purchase on 
the credit card is being made.  While the lack of a followup purchase
will normally eventually timeout the resulting "purchase authorization"
after some period of time (typically two weeks or so) that is credit
that is unavailable to you during that time--important if you have low
credit limits.  Also, the credit card firms may become irate about
this practice if it occurs too often.

To answer a question I asked recently, yes there is a public domain (or
rather free) Pascal compiler for CP/M.  It's JRT Pascal and it's in
micro:<sigm.vol082> on simtel20.  After a lot of work, I mangaged to
bootstrap my machine to modem7 by way of mboot3, ftp all the files
(warning: get20 didn't always work properly on my machine), and
download them.  (Strange, I never had to convert ITS format.  I wonder
if ftp or something was doing that for me.)

Anyway, the program I want to run gets some strange errors from JRT for
normal operations involving read, readln, write, writeln, reset, and
rewrite.  Could someone tell me where I can find a copy of the JRT
manual or a few large example programs using those features?  Thanks.

One quirk I've already fixed was that you can't use the string
initialize as an identifier in JRT.  I had
	procedure initialize; 
and JRT said identifier expected.  Changing the string stopped the
error message.

Does anyone know if it's possible to create stand alone applications
with JRT or will I always have to type: exec file.int ?

Thank you for your help!

Here's sort of a round about answer to your question.  As you are a usenet
user, the following should provide you with some information:
"How can a user of a USENET host access the public domain
microcomputer software collection on the DDN/MILNET host
SIMTEL20" is being asked with increasing frequency as that
software collection continues to grow.  Unfortunately, direct
access is not possible as there is no UUCP gateway for file
transfer between SIMTEL20 (running TOPS-20) and a USENET host (as
there is for electronic mail).

(DDN, formerly known as ARPANET, is the Defense Data Network.
DDN, along with Arpanet, SATNET, SRINET, etc. are all members of 
a TCP/IP protocol-based, multiple gateway network called InterNet.)

USENET has been built on adjacent hosts voluntarily agreeing to
store-and-forward relatively short messages across the USENET
over dialup lines at 300 or 1200 bps.  In the past, helpful InterNet
users would fetch the file(s) requested and then e-mail them to
the requestor.  However, it has been pointed out that large file
transfers disrupt the service, delay the shorter messages, and
generate unacceptably large phone bills, all of which add up to
threaten the tenuous connections that some USENET hosts can
barely afford to have.  Therefore, we have been asked to
encourage InterNet users not to pass archive programs this way.

Now for the good news.  Some InterNet users, if sent a suitable disk,
will download files and return mail the floppy to the requestor.
To find a friendly InterNet user, send a message to INFO-CPM at DDN
host AMSAA.ARPA via net.micro.cpm identifying your disk format and 
your request.  Usually, someone will respond and come to your aid.
If not, don't be bashful, wait a week and try again.  But please
remember, any such arrangements are strictly between you and your
respondent.  This is not, repeat NOT, a service of either the InterNet
or INFO-CPM.

If the above arrangement is inconvenient, or doesn't work, here
are several other sources for public domain software.


----------------------------------------------------------------------

Information (and prices) are subject to change without notice.  A
volume is usually one floppy disk.

5. Other sources:

Compuserve Information Service is another source of public domain
software. There are a number of special interest groups (SIGs)
devoted to specific hardware as well as CP-MIG, the generic CP/M
SIG, a repository for a large quantity of public domain software
downloadable by the Compuserve file transer protocol (Christensen
protocol is expected by late summer, 1984). There is no charge for
access to CP-MIG other than the standard CIS connect charges, and
Compuserve can be accessed through their own communications network
or through Tymnet.

... and many Remote CP/M (RCPM) systems around the country, where
software is available for downloading for the price of a phone
call.  The May 1984 issue of Microsystems contains the full listing of
known RCPMs at the time of publication.

Subject:  Problems with "get20", UNIX auto-ftp script:

Dan - In a recent posting, you mentioned that "get20" didn't always work
correctly on your machine.  You also wondered why you didn't have to strip
ITS headers from binary files.

     ITS headers are no longer being used on binary files in the SIMTEL20
archives.  This has been the case for many months.  Therefore, the "behead"
utility used with "get20" is now superfluous, and it can be deleted.  If you
do delete it, I suggest you also edit out all references to "behead" in the
"get20" script to avoid "file not found" complaints.

     For those who don't already know, "get20" was written by Ferd Brundick of
the US Army Ballistic Research Laboratory.  It is a Bourne shell script that
takes arguments from the cammand line and forms commands which it sends to the
"ftp" file transfer program to automatically transfer files from the archives
on SIMTEL20.  I have modified "get20" to take a more complex command line, but
it now works with ANY TOPS-20 target machine.  Thus, it can be used with CU20B
for Kermit files, with USC-ISIB for IBM-PC files, with SRI-NIC for the list of
interest groups (PS:<NETINFO>INTEREST-GROUPS.TXT), or whatever.  The new
version of "get20" will be sent to the archives when I have finished testing
it.  As of now, it seems to be working fine.  However, I am very interested in
hearing specifics from anyone having trouble with "get20" in its present form.

     So Dan (and anyone else), if you will send me a thorough description of
the environment in which you are using "get20" with less than satisfactory
results, perhaps the program can be improved to eliminate the problems you are
having.  GET20 can be found on SIMTEL20 in PS:<UNIX.CPM>GET20.  The file
PS:<UNIX.CPM>AUTOFTP.DOC tells how to use it.

Subject: The PC/BLUE Collection

The complete PC/BLUE distribution is now available on SIMTEL20 from
Volumes 000 through 124 in PD:<PC-BLUE.VOLnnn>.  (Note the PD:
designation as the current alias for the MICRO: structure.)

Some notes:

1.  Volumes 001 through 042 were reissued on double-sided disks, two
volumes per disk.  We made no attempt to split the files on those
disks into their respective volumes as originally issued.  Thus, for
the volumes in this range, the files for the even-numbered volumes
will be found in the directory containing the next-lower numbered
volume.  There are a few exceptions.  It would be best to get a copy
of PD:<PC-BLUE>PC-BLUE.CRCLST to check.

2.  These volumes were uploaded from copies of the distribution disks
using a real IBM-PC using MEX-PC, except for two, which were uploaded
later.  In all cases, the MODEM protocol was used.  This means that
because PCDOS stores files in exact length and the MODEM protocol
sends fixed blocks of 128, those files which were not exact multiples
of 128 could not be checked with CRCK to verify the values against the
published values in the -CATALOG files.  Thus, we are going to assume,
unless otherwise informed, that the copies were correctly uploaded
from the disks we received, and further assume that the disks we
received were correct copies of the master disks from which the
published CRCs were computed.  This is further compounded by the fact
that we uploaded all the files in binary format and then post-processed
the files to convert to ASCII those which follow certain rules.  Thus,
the resulting CRCs we publish in PD:<PC-BLUE>PC-BLUE.CRCLST assume
files are multiples of 128 and ASCII files are padded with ^Zs to the
next 128-byte boundary.

3.  We used the MODEM protocol instead of KERMIT so that you may use
either protocol to download these files and use our published CRC
values to verify that you got a correct copy of what we have stored
here.  Had we used KERMIT, those of you using MODEM would not have any
basis to check on the file transfers.

4.  Given the recent appearance of so-called Trojan Horse programs, we
make no guarantees that these programs will work as documented and
only as documented, and furthermore assume no liability should these
programs fail to work or cause damage, incidental or otherwise.  We
merely present this collection as-is for those of you with Internet
FTP access to SIMTEL20 for your convenience.

5.  For those users at sites without Internet access, have your site
manager contact me to make arrangements for one-time, as-is, tape
copies of our collections made at our convenience on tapes you supply
with return postage.  There is no fee and our turnaround is slow.  We
can only write TOPS-20 DUMPER, TOPS-10 Interchange, and Unix tar
format tapes, 9-TRK, 1600 bpi.

Bug? What bu....GULP!

Well,  I don't really know how you would go about it under CP/M 2.x, but 
under CP/M + (aka, CP/M 3.x), there is a new BDOS call (actually, there 
are now MANY new BDOS calls....), number 47(decimal), which is "Chain to
Program."  To use it, place a complete command line (null terminated) in
the default DMA buffer at 0080H, and execute this call.  If the E reg. is
set to 0FFH, then the CCP will change the default drive and user to the
current values; if E is anything else, they will remain the default DMA
values.

There are many new features in CP/M + seem nice, such as this, and there is
a "Load Overlay" call, date and time support, file passwording (in the
banked version), YES, CP/M+ does support banked memory.  Neat stuff.
I started using CP/M 2.2, but I never really got into writing assembly for
it until I got this CP/M+ system.  I think they have done some nice things
here for the asm programmer.  (well, that's my two bits.....)

NetLandians,

Could someone please point me to the documentation/instructions for
CROSS - the cross assembler available on some TOPS-20 hosts, and used
extensively for KERMIT applications.

Second:  Is CROSS proprietary or public domain?

Third:  What happened to CU20B as a host?  The KERMIT archives are out there
(Columbia University), and I saw the msg they were moving the archives to
another disk... but when trying to FTP to CU20B, I get an unknown host error.
Can anyone point me right?

Thanks in advance,

Hi,

can anybody mail a list, if possible complete, of the SIMTEL-20 software ?

Is anybody willing to download some of the software on VAX/VMS ?

Unfortunately there is no ARPA host available in Germany, so I have to try

and find somebody who can help me.

Who can I contact directly at SIMTEL-20 ?

Any help will be very much appreciated.

Eberhard W. Lisse

ps.

I'm a senior in the Technical University of Aachen, Faculty of Medicine, which

only very recently has been connected to BITNET, and have been volunteered

by the German CP/M-UG to try and get those public domaine software over here.

We ARE a developing country, computerwise.

Thanks again,

NetLandians,

JANAP 128 is a peculiar message format used on the AUTODIN system.  I hacked
a little conversion program in BASIC to reformat a crude text file into full
genuine JANAP128.  Did this quite a while ago (part of a little test
interfacing a micro with a big AN/TYC-39 automated switch with GTE.

It's kinda US Army stuff, and I'll make it public domain since I wrote the
sucker on my own system, my own time.  But does anyone NEED such a beastie?
Don't EVEN think of linking into the AUTODIN with your Wombat 68000 either...
got our fingers crushed severely over that!

So yell if you're interested.

I have a 4 Mhz Z80 " Pulsar " SBC system (Australian Design and Manufacture)
which runs under CP/M 2.2 and uses Mitsubishi 8" and 5 1/4" (8" look-alike)
disc drives.

My system can currently format/read/write standard format, IBM-CP/M 256k as 
well as 1.2 Meg quad density discs. I am interested in finding public domain
or reasonably priced commercial software which will allow me to format/read/
write to a range of other disc formats such as IBM PC, Kapro, Osborne etc. I
realise that suitable programs probably exist in the SIGM, CPMUG and other 
Archives but would appreciate hearing from anyone who has had some experience
with their use in systems similar to mine. 

One of the 5 1/4" drives has the facility of being run at 300 rpm as well as
the standard 360 rpm and with the right software this should allow the system
to read and write to/from almost any disc format ? I would welcome any 
comments, laughter etc.

David - Host CU20B, repository of the Kermit files, is still answering the
net.  If your local host tables have gotten trashed, you might try using the
numerical network address 192.5.43.128.  That way, your ftp won't have to look
it up.

Here's an explanation of the problem I was having with get20.  I was using
it to transfer binary files from Simtel20 to this Unix Vax.  When I did,
I would get strange files that had some recognizable text in them.  If I
ftp'd the same file in tenex mode, it arrived properly.  Here's why:

So if you want to use get20 on a Unix machine, you better make sure that
it's using tenex mode.

If you are using a diasy driven for your printer a '.lh16' dot

If you use a tty-like printer driver all is not lost - make up a

Also, there is the ws3330.dqc file in <cpm.wstar> at simtel20 that

You can double space your WS documents without having to reformat
the whole file by writing a quick little BASIS program that will
setup your printer to linefeed after each carriage return.  Your
only problem will probably be that the page breaks will cause you
to have an extra blank page of output every third page.  Of
course you could suppress page formatting and avoid that as well.
Once you have that two or three line BASIC program, you can run
it anytime you want to output a double-spaced copy from WordStar.

Allen,

Re doing a double spacing in WordStar files.. if no one else has a better
idea, I suggest using ^Q^A substitution command, to look for all ^N's
(WS's abbreviation for the normal CR/LF), and replacing them with ^N^J
(CR/LF/LF) or ^N^N (CR/LF/CR/LF).  You could then pick and choose if you
desired NOT to double-double space between paragraphs.  No additional
formatting needed.  If you want a SOFT doublespacing... ugh... couldn't do
that, I don't think, since no way to send the hi-bit CR...

Hope this helps,
David Kirschbaum

    Is there a quick way of doing double spacing on Wordstar without
    reformatting the whole file or using mailmerge.  (or is there a patch?)
    
    Thanks, Allan
    
	      --------------------
		
Allan,

There are two ways that I know of:

1.  Set  the  line spacing to 2 with the Ctl-O-S command when you
begin, or,

2. Patch the line spacing byte to show 2 rather than 1  (I  con't
have  the address here at the office, but it is in most of the PD
files on patching WS).

Hope I've helped.

In a directory entry are 16 bytes for storing allocation group numbers of
the extent.  If the number of allocation groups is larger than 255 then
these numbers take up two bytes, else one byte.  Now, once you know the
size of an allocation group (typically 1K or 2K) you can compute how much
disk space one directory entry can refer to - this typically comes to 16K
or 32K.  If it is 16K or less, then the maximum number of 128-byte sectors
in that space is 128 or less, so the field giving the number of sectors
holds that number just fine, and extents are numbered sequentially.
On the other hand, if it is 32K or more, then the maxmimum number of 128-
byte sectors is 256 or more.  In this case we define an extent to be 16K
of file space, and each directory entry will refer to more than one extent.
The extent number field of the directory entry will contain the number of
the LAST extent referred to, and the number-of-sectors field will indicate
the number of sectors in that last extent.  The extents other than the 
last one all contain 128 sectors, so everything is determined.
  Another way to think about it is this.  Suppose 2**(n+7) is the number of
sectors one directory entry can reference.  Then we have n bits of overflow
from the number-of-sectors field (7 bits) and those n bits are stashed in
the low order part of the extent-number-field.  What makes this not QUITE
right is that on occasion the 8-th bit of the number-of-sectors field is 1,
and then that bit is the overflow bit for the other n+7 bits.

Quoteing verbatum from the DBase manual I have,

"SET CALL TO <address>

Sets the decimal address that will be called by dBASE CALL command.

CALL [<memvar>]

Performs a machine language call to the address set by a SET CALL TO or
the default address if no SET CALL has been done. There are about 254
bytes of stack available, the HL register pair points to the first byte
if the <memvar> was a character string.  It is most important that no
attempts be made to lengthen or shorten a character string.  Control can
be passed back to dBASE with a RET instruction."

The above is the sum total about the CALL instruction, that I have in my
manual.

I have used the combination SET CALL TO <address> and then CALL (with no
<memvar>) with a RET in the machine language code, and that functions as
expected, however, my questions are:

1. What is the DEFAULT address, to which the documentation alludes?
2. "There are about 254 bytes of stack available", where?  Starting at
the default address?
3. What is the function of <memvar>?  Is it to pass a parameter to the
machine language routine?  Give an example.
4. "the HL register pair points to the first byte if the <memvar> was a
character string"  the first byte of what, the <memvar> address? 

Any answers would be apperciated.

Thanks

I don't know what discussion I caught the tail end of with the message about
TURBO Pascal, but it does not follow the UCSD standard.  I use and highly
recommend TURBO Pascal, but it has some distinct non standard characteristics,
including the fact the the standard I/O procedures "get" and "put" are not
implemented in TURBO and instead there are extended "read" and "write"
procedures.  For more info see Dr. Dobb's Journal #105 (july 85).

			(8/15/85 Wall St. Journal)
				ARF! ARF!
	Richard Streeter's bytes got bitten by an "Arf Arf," which isn't
a dog but a horse.
	Mr. Streeter, director of development in the engineering department
of CBS Inc. and home-computer buff, was browsing recently through the
offerings of Family Ledger, a computer bulletin board that can be used by
anybody with a computer and a telephone to swap advice, games or programs -
or to make mischief.  Mr. Streeter loaded into his computer a program that
was billed as enhancing his IBM program's graphics; instead it instantly wiped
out the 900 accounting, word processing and game programs he had stored in
his computer over the years.  All that was left was a taunt glowing back
at him from the screen: "Arf! Arf! Got You!"
"HACKERS" STRIKE AGAIN
	This latest form of computer vandalism - dubbed for obvious reasons
a Trojan Horse - is the work of the same kind of anonymous "hackers" who
get their kicks stealing sensitive data from government computers or invading
school computers to change grades.  But instead of stealing, Trojan Horses
just destroy all the data files in the computer.
	Trojan Horse creators are nearly impossible to catch - they usually
provide phony names and addresses with their programs - and the malevolent
programs often slip by bulletin-board operators.  But they are becoming a
real nuisance.  Several variations of the "Arf! Arf!" program have made
the rounds, including one that poses as a "super-directory" that
conveniently places computer files in alphabetical order.
	Operators have begun to take names and addresses of electronic
bulletin-board users so they can check their authenticity.  When a
computer vandal is uncovered, the word is passed to other operators.
Special testing programs also allow them to study the wording of
submitted programs and detect suspicious commands.
INTERFACER BEWARE
	But while Al Stone, the computer consultant who runs Long Island
based Family Ledger, has such a testing program, he says he didn't have time
to screen the "Arf! Arf!" that bit Mr. Streeter.  "Don't attempt to run
something unless you know its pedigree," he says.
	That's good advice, because the computer pranksters are getting more
clever - and nastier.  They are now creating even-more-insidious programs
that gradually eat away existing files as they are used.  Appropriately
enough, these new programs are known as "worms".

I think the only instruction differences from 8080 to 8085 are the RIM and SIM
instructions to handle the serial I/O lines. So, in, for instance, ASM, the
standard CP/M assembler, a RIM is:
	db	20h		; RIM
and a SIM is:
	db	30h		; SIM
If you have a macro-assembler or Z80 assembler, there may be a slight difference
but there is really nothing all that special about the 8085.

The 8085 also has interrupts 5.5, 6.5, and 7.5 which vector 4 bytes later than
interrupts 5, 6, and 7, and have separate, simply utilized pins, and it has
multiplexed the data with half the address pins to make room for the pins with
the extra functions, but those features have no effect on the assembler.

Re: the "Arf! Arf!" article recently posted.

At least two things may be done to reduce the possibility of damabe
caused by BBS distributed worms.

1) cleared and un-cleared programs should be in seperate directories,
   such that the downloader knows that he is taking a risk selecting
   a program from the set of un-cleared files (for directories, read
   user area in CP/M....alternately the file type (extension) could
   be used to serve a similar purpose...)

2) when testing recently aquired software, use a non-essential diskette.
   if you have an external hard disk, disconnect it.  If you have
   an internal hard disk....you're on your own....I don't know (offhand)
   of any way to disallow access to an internal hard disk drive...although
   some enterprising BIOS hacker could possibly find a way.....

P.S.:  Note that the use of the term "hacker" above is meant in the
       older, more acceptable sense....not the more recently aquired
       derogatory meaning that the media have been promoting.

  A 'logical' extent in CP/M(tm) is of size 16K (128 records of 128 bytes
each). In the simplest case when file space allocation is done in blocks of
1K, each physical extent holds 16 1K block entries (128 records) and is the
same as a 'logical' extent. In this case the extent numbers will be seen to be
0, 1, 2, etc.. However, when disk space is allocated in larger units (2K, 3K,..
16K), each physical extent actually corresponds to >128 records. In this 
situation, after 128 records have been written to an extent, the same extent
, say 0, becomes extent no. + 1, ie 1 in our case and the record count is reset
to 0. This goes on until all 16 allocation table entries are full, then a
new physical extent is created.

>The record count field was not an exact record count for the extent (nor

 The above explanation also clears this.

The fine folks at Microprocessors Unlimited do make mistakes.  However, the
way they deal with their mistakes is just as impressive as their initial
service.   I have placed several orders with them.  On one occasion they
sent the wrong chips.  I phoned them and they sent out replacements that
same day.  The correct chips arrived the following day by Federal Express.
In addition, I was told to reduce my payment by an amount adequate to cover
my expenses for correcting the order and returning the unwanted chips.

After assembly, (with M80) the HEX file is created by linking 
such that,the laod address is A400H (41984, above the limit of 
memory used by dBase) as follows:

L80 /PA400,DIREAD,DIREAD/X/N/E


This is a pretty primative example, but it does exercise the
dBase machine language interface functions.

If anybody has any information regarding the defaults,
I would also be interested.

I am looking for a copy of MEX740.COM (public domain) to use on my
C128. A copy for an Osborne will work fine since the diskette formatting
is the same. Anyone out there with one? Thanks.

Richard et al,

*** FLAME ON ***

You know, I'm getting bloody tired of the misuse and abuse of the term
"hacker".  I worked hard to learn enough to hopefully be considered a member
of those illustrious ranks, and do NOT like being associated with vandals,
delinquents, criminal elements, and the like.

The journalists are mainly responsible for the recent misuse, and delight in
calling any computer-related crime or incident the work of "hackers".
Perhaps a few thousand irate letters to editors, etc., would change their
misguided vocabulary.

I would suggest the use of the word "crasher" (as was recently used in a
book, "The Inner Circle", so I was told) to apply to the destructive or
criminal elements.  Hacker should remain a descriptive term of those who
love computers and programming for their own sake.

For the HD64180, the only source (aside from Hitachi) that I am aware of
is Micromint (see Z-NEWS 208 or 209 for the 800 number).  I have been
told (I haven't seen the price list myself) that Micromint will see you
the 64180 in quan 1 for $20.  The manual is available for $25.  There should
be much more info in the Sept Byte, which features the SB180 board.
I am coming out with a new set of notes on the 64180, and this will be
posted on SIMTEL20 and to USENET.

personally, I like Lauren Weinstein's "cracker" terminology.  He suggested
the use of that term in UNIX/World last year (1984).  Maybe all we old
time 'hackers' should send an electronic petition to one of the mags
on the net and see if they will do something about it.  I notice that

Mr. MacDonald-
As far as I know, What you are asking for is a mishmash of (2) products.
MEX is a program that is fairly new, and versions have only gotten as far
as 1.14 (ie, MEX114) in the public domain, although there is a buyable
product that I hear is much better. I use MEX112 right now, haven't gotten
around to implementing MEX114, and it's just great, although a little
hefty size-wise, especially including the help-file. Ron Fowler puts that
out (I think, anybody may correct), correcttion, DOES put that out and I think 
he can be contacted by yelling "Hey Ron G Fowler" around here or on info-MODEMXX
or info-MODEM7.

MDM740, on the other hand, comes from the esteemed line begun by the illustrious
Ward Christiensen of Christiensen protocol (and other) fame. 
*PLUG* A great guy and an inspiration to us all. *PLUGend* He really deserves
it, though, cause he's really done SO much to help the micro-world grow from
an arcane hobby to something really big like this.
	Getting back to it-MDM740, though in the public domain, was copyrighted
by Irv Hoff *FLAME ON*, who really did the PD world NO FAVOR by doing so,
and ensured the demise of a classic series of reliable(well, semi-, anyway)
series of communications software by despoiling it with his copyright, and
not allowing a source release for those of us who needed it, me for example.
May he get what he deserves.*FLAME OFF*
	The software is nice, but MODM700, another PD program, is just about
the same, with source, too! Hopefully the guys who put this out won't
make Mr. Hoff's mistake, and this will be able to carry on in it's place.
(Note: Irv Hoff has done other, fairly nice noteworthy stuff; he isn't
really bad, just made a dumb decision.)
If you're interested in a fairly straightforward, compact program, this one's
for you. I have a copy, but you can probably get it from your local BBS
just as well, probably even cheaper. Check around for MEX114, too.
Well, hope this helps you out. If you really need them, send mail to me at:

  Re: ROBOTICS 2400 UPDATE

        For those of you using the U.S. Robotics 2400 baud modem
(I have two on my system), you should call U.S. Robotics (800 dial
usr) and request the ROM update. The new version is 242 (you can use
the ATI command to check yours) and fixes many problems and incorporates
a number of additions suggested by users. The update is free (try that
with Hayes).  For the record; my experiences with U.S. Robotics have
been excellent.  They are responsive and seem to care about their
product and its users.  I highly recommend their Courier 2400 mod
(and the half=price sysop offer is still in effect).

Notes aded by Paul Foote - 08/17/85

     Thanks to Tim T. for letting us know about the Courier ROM upgrade.
I too own two Couriers and am delighted with their performance.  By using
the ATI0 command in terminal mode, I found out one had ROM vers. 240,
while the other was vers. 241.  So I called USR Technical Service (their
direct phone number is 312-982-5151, in case you have problems with the
800 number), and they said they would send two vers. 242 plug-in ROMs by
UPS two day air.  They also gave me simple instructions for installing
the new ROMS, and requested that I send them back the old ROMs after
I verified the new ones worked.  I was most impressed with their friendly
and professional helpfulness.  By the way, the USR rep. said they
believe all of the Courier 2400's distributed in their SYSOP offer have
the vers. 242 ROM, but you may want to check anyway.

Message-ID: <12137641695.18.RCONN@SIMTEL20.ARPA>

John,

	I would say that the first step is to buy the book "ZCPR3:
The Manual" (I know it sounds like I am plugging my own book here).
The reason is that the manual is the most complete source for all info
on the ZCPR3 System - it describes usage, all the tools, theory of
operation, and installation.

	When it comes to installation, there are two options: (1)
manual install and (2) automatic install via Z3-DOT-COM (a comercial
product from Echelon).  Automatic install is the easiest (taking only
minutes) an not very expensive (I don't remember the price, but I don't
think it is too high).  Manual install takes a lot more time but produces
the best results (the Z3 System is on the System Tracks).

	If you decide to do the manual install, get the "ZCPR3 Installation
Workbook" -- it helps a lot.  Also, for full functionality you would want
to consider the document "ZCPR3 and IOPs", which discusses the implementation
of I/O Packages under ZCPR3 (which can be used for disk I/O redirection,
function key operation, arrays of I/O devices, and other useful capabilities).

	Finally, but not least, read thru the Echelon newsletters.
There are 27 of them now: Z3NEWS 001-009, 101-109, and 201-209.  301
just came out (making 28), and they come out every 2 weeks.

	Acquisition Data:
		ZCPR3: The Manual (paperback book, available from
Echelon for $20 or the Library of Computer and Information Sciences and
the Small Computer Book Club [if you are a member] for less)
		ZCPR3 Installation Workbook - free (available on
Z-Nodes via downloading or from Echelon in hardcopy for a minor
cost)
		ZCPR3 and IOPs - free (available on Z-Nodes via
downloading or from Echelon in hardcopy for $10)
		Z-News Newsletters - free (available on Z-Nodes via
downloading or from Echelon for a minor subscription fee in hardcopy)

	Many non-Z-Nodes (RCPMs) are carrying the doc files also.
Echelon can be written to:
		Echelon, Inc
		101 First St
		Suite 427
		Los Altos, CA  94022
		415-948-3820

	The newsletters provide tons of information on other items, such
as ZRDOS, Z-System tools, etc, which may be of interest also.

GTE/TELENET is offering a new service called "PC Pursuit". It allows
unlimited 1200 baud modem calls between 12 major cities for a flat fee
of $25/month. The calls can on|y be made after 6PM or on weekends.

Currently the cities supported are: Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Dallas,
Denver, Detroit, Houston, Los Angeles, New York, Philadelphia, San
Francisco, and Washington DC.

Only the originator of the call has to be signed up with GTE, the
destination can be any answering modem in the 12 supported cities.  The
$25/month buys the right to originate the calls from one fixed number.
GTE imposes this as follows: You call a local number, identify yourself
and make the destination request. GTE drops the line, calls the
destination, and when successful calls you back at your registered
number. They guarantee to call you back withing 30 seconds of carrier
at the destination.

GTE is marketing this to PC users who want to access out of town
databases. However, it strikes me that this service could cut
UUCP/mail/netnews and other phone based networking costs way down. The
service appears to be transparent to the destination, but clearly the
connection software would have to be hacked to accomodate GTE's call
origination scheme.

GTE will provide information about the service at 800-368-4215.

I have no connection with GTE, and the above exhausts my knowledge
of the service. I don't know, for example, if the data path provided
is really a full 8 bit path, or if there are timing issues that
would interfere with some protocols. I would guess they run their
own error correction for the long haul part of the circuit, and
the subscriber would only have to worry about errors on the local
circuits at the endpoints.

                                George




               Casey at the Byte

              a poem by Frank Jacobs (from MAD Magazine no. 258, October 1985)

         (with apologies to Ernest Lawrence Thayer)



The meeting at the White House
    Wasn't going well that day;
The budget plan was lost,
    Thus causing ulcers and dismay;
And when Jones failed at the keyboard
    And Kowalski proved a dud,
One could sense some great disaster,
    Like an avalanche or flood.

"Don't panic," said the President,
    "Don't blab it to the press;
"It's true without the budget plan
    "The country's in a mess;
"Two other "aces" failed so far
    "To find just where it is,
"And so I've summoned Casey-
    "With computers he's a whiz"

A gasp was heard as Casey
    Made his entrance on the scene;
'Twas clear that he was just a lad
    No older than sixteen;
And yet despite his lack of years,
    One fact outshone the rest-
As a trouble shooting "hacker"
    His credentials were the best.

He boasted a degree from Yale,
    Plus two from M.I.T.;
His work with "backup", "RAM" and "track"
    Was marvelous to see;
The range of his computer skills
    Was hailed both near and far
From Commodore to IBM,
    From Wang to NCR.

There was ease in Casey's manner
    As he entered his commands;
One could sense some mighty power
    Was contained within his hands
With lightning speed his fingers moved
    To press each crucial key;
"The budget plan exists," he said.
    "It cannot hide from me."

With great persistense Casey toiled,
    And yet, upon the screen,
No buried data came to light
    From in the great machine,
Except for birthday greetings
    To a Congressman in Maine,
Two vetos and a slogan
    From the '84 campaign.

The strain now shows in Casey's eyes;
    He's aged a dozen years;
But then, at last, to joyful shouts,
    The budget plan appears!
And now he lifts his head in pride,
    A smile upon his face;
And now the mood is shattered
    As his elbow hits "ERASE".

Oh, somewhere there are nations
    Where the keenest minds prevail,
Where budgets can be balanced
    And the experts never fail;
And somewhere data's safely stored,
    Preserved beyond a doubt,
But no plan can save the Whit House-
    Klutzy Casey wiped it out.

Subject: GTE Telenet PC Pursuit - additional info available

GTE Telenet has an 800 number to call for more information on "PC
Pursuit".  It turned out to be a modem connected to a "FIDO" bbs
system.  I downloaded all the info files and made a transcript of the
terminal session.  It's available from SIMTEL20 as:

Filename			Type	 Bytes	 CRC

Directory MICRO:<CPM.GENDOC>
PCPURSUT.LBR.1			BINARY	 13184  FC34H

If you are unable to access Simtel-20 because of network restrictions
this file is available for downloading (using the XMODEM protocol) on
my RCPM Royal Oak (MI) which may be accessed at 300 baud using the
103a modem mode or 1200 baud using either the 212a or Vadic 3400
modes.  The telephone number is (313) 759-6569.  The file is on the D:
drive.

Additional notes: There is a one-time sign-up fee of $25 for "PC
Pursuit".  Also, it's unlikely that you'll be able to access bbs
systems in the distant city if they are "message-unit" calls for the
Telenet dial-out node.  Unfortunately this IS the case here in the
Detroit area where my RCPM is located.  PC Pursuit users will probably
not be able to access it since it's a "near-zone" message unit call
from the Telenet node.

The GTE Telenet FIDO number is (800) 835-3001.

There are some significant limitations to this service that people
should be aware of (I talked to one of the system designers)...

1) Calls are limited to one hour.
2) While they haven't implemented the restrictions yet, they are
   likely to limit both the originating and terminating ends of the
   calls to phone numbers that are a LOCAL CALL from their dialout nodes.
   This might mean, for example, that a person in West L.A. couldn't
   use the service since they are not local to the dialout node
   (which is in downtown L.A.).  The problem is that the service
   must dial out at both ends, and they are apparently unwilling to
   eat the ZUM/toll charges indefinitely.  When and how restrictions
   would be implemented (and on what basis) is still unclear, but they
   told me that something would definitely happen in the area of
   restrictions.
3) The service is really designed for individuals, not for
   commercial use.  They aren't trying to screen out the companies at 
   this time and will let them sign up, but it isn't clear what will
   happen if commercial users start clogging things up.
4) Capacity is limited.  In L.A., for example, there can only be
   a maximum of 24 users on the service at any given time.
   They can obviously expand this within some limits, but not
   indefinitely.
5) It isn't clear how good the response is going to be for many
   applications.  TELENET is always very bursty and subject to
   pretty slow throughput much of the time (as any TELENET user
   will tell you).

It's certainly an interesting service, but seems mostly oriented toward
what they originally said -- people sitting there typing at remote BBS's.

You might be interested in a new part from Motorola, it's the
MC145406. It's a CMOS tranceiver that combines the functions of the
1488 and 1489. It contains 3 drivers and 3 receivers. It runs on +-5
V. And it uses 1/10 the power of the 1488. Price is $1.59 in 100-unit
quantities (see _Electronic Design_, August 8,1985, pg. 149).

Some people still have not heard that Sol Libes, founder of

Ziff-Davis).  The new Journal is patterned after the original, with
many technical articles on microcomputers of one sort or another. The
ad/editorial ratio is 40/60; most computer mags are 60% ads; this one
is 60% articles.

Paul--two things.  First, I think you're looking either for MODEM7 or
MEX.  The latest version of the former is (in at least one line of
descent) is MDM740, and the latest version of the latter is MEX114.
Second, unless the Commodore 128's modem port has been set up exactly
the same as the Osborne's (which is unlikely) , an Osborne version of
MODEM7 or MEX won't work on the C-128.  I don't know if C-128 overlays
(overlays are pieces of machine code which customize a program to a
specific computer) exists for MODEM7 or MEX.  If you have ARPANET
access, MODEM7 and MEX can be gotten by anonymous FTP to
SIMTEL20.ARPA.  If not, try getting in touch with:

		P.O. Box 97

Good luck, and mail me if you need any help.  -- Bill Edwards

David, Richard, and (undoubtedly) others-

	Although I agree with David's exception to the word "hackers", being
a originally positive/neutral word badly distorted by media, and also that
the word "hacker" should, if possible, be re-corrected to it's original
(glorious?) usage, I feel it a _very_ bad idea to use the name "crashers", as
used by Bill Landreth in his (ghostwritten) book, as he himself was a criminal
who escaped a more serious punishment by pleading insanity (ha ain't, folks;
read on) and age.  Instead, he was required to pay his phone bills,
and given a two-year parole that _required_ him to attend college for the next
two years. I should have such a sentence, eh? Afterward, a firm selling ghost-
written novels got in touch with him, as a result of which he is now getting
a regular income in royalties, and I believe is now a computer security
consultant making a fair amount of money doing that. Although it seems that
crime, for him, has paid fairly well, I wouldn't personally stoop so low as
to use a phrase coined by someone that has harmed the computing field in this
manner.  An alternate suggestion has been advanced in this area, which is
"worms".  The nickname is for those who "worm" there way into systems they 
don't have legal access to, and I feel that the word, with it's negative
semantic connotations, is more apropo. Also, the word has origins going back to
"tapeworms", which is the nickname for a program designed to get into systems,
gain higher access, poke into areas the security system was designed for, or
just plain be destructive (Also see: Trojan Horse).  Let's not dignify these
jerks with the kind of name _they_ call themselves; know them for the worms they
really are.

Re:   BYE501/KMD04/IMP241

BYE501 adds full support to CP/M 3 users, adds TIMEON support
to systems without a clock, fixes several problems with LUX
users and MBBS, adds the extended BDOS calls to support all
versions of XMODEM and KMD04 and adds HS4800 and HS9600 code
to support the new 300/1200/2400/4800/9600 bps modems that
will start beta test on Potpourri soon.  Read the BYE5.HIS
file for a full summary of new features.

BYE5.DOC and B5-CPM3.DOC provide a complete guide for installing and
using BYE5 for CP/M 2 and CP/M 3 systems.  Systems running BYE5/KMD04
can now offer batch-mode file transfers to the general public, since
TIMEON security is available with or without a clock.  KMD04 allows
batch up/downloads for IMP241, Yam and ProYam users (MEX soon?).
KMD04 also presents a menu for selecting the subject matter before
asking for a description of the upload.

                             REQUEST
                             -------

Having just arrived at APG BRL from the Greaty South Land (Australia). I am 
in the process of setting up my CP/M system to communicate with the American 
Net through the BRL VAX and consequently reqire a copy of KERMIT or a similar
compatible modem program. My system uses 8" drives which read/write standard 
IBM 3740 CP/M SSSD 256k format discs. I would appreciate it if someone 
(preferably local to save time) with a similar system could provide me with 
a copy of KERMIT.ASM and KERMIT.DOC or any other suitable program in my system
disc format. I will provide 8" disc(s) of course.

Thanking any kind individual(s) in advance! I can be reached through the net 
or by phone at (301) 278 6076.

Subject: --- more on "hacker" ---
To: info-cpm@AMSAA.ARPA
Reply-To: nep.pgelhausen@AMES-VMSB.ARPA


Kevin suggested the use of the term "worm" instead of hacker, basically
(from what I read in his letter) because he didn't like the idea that
the guy that suggested the term "crasher" is making money on his book.

Judging from the excerpt of the book (Out of the Inner Circle) that
was published in Popular Computing (may 85), he actually has a well
thought-out set of classifications for what the press calls "hackers",
these are:
   Novice, Student, Tourist, Crasher, & Thief

I may not agree (entirely) with these classifications...but that is
on the basis of having read the excerpt explaining them, not because
I am jealous of the guy making money and being "sentanced to college
for two years".

In the meantime, the issue was to correct the misuse of the 
term "hacker", not to define a new derogatory term for those who
get their amusement from computers at the expense of others.
Unfortunately the term has meant many things to many people 
for quite a while....anything from a reasonably competant
programmer, to the person who enjoys talking to computers
more than to other human beings.  The problem with trying to
correct the mis-use of this term is that it is hard to pin
down and define "proper use".  The only way I can say it is
that uses feel right, and others don't.  Someone out there
might be eloquent enought to come up w/ a definition that
satisfies everyone (except the media, whose mis-use of the
term is what sparked this whole thing).....but I don't think
that I could (or would presume) to attempt the definitive definition
of this illustrious term.

From: iaips-dcas@USC-ISI.ARPA
To: info-cpm@AMSAA.ARPA, info-micro@AMSAA.ARPA
cc: IAIPS-DCAS@USC-ISI.ARPA

     I have a 1982 vintage KayproII with badly worn disk drives.  Since I'll
be replacing them soon I decided to get the Micro-Cornucopia Pro 8 upgrade kit
and buy double sided drives, either double density or quad density.

     Recently I was informed of a good deal (99 bucks) on Shugart DSQD drives
so, I am leaning in that direction.  (760k - Wow!)

     Being a cautious sort, I would like to know if anyone out there has done
a similar upgrade and can clue me in on the possible pitfalls. Thanks.

Sorry, regretable as it is, but the word "Hacker" is now in the public
vocabulary permanently (well, maybe only for a couple of hundred years
to come) with a pejorative connotation.  Those who aspire to the title
Hacker in a non-pejorative connotation are going to have to coin
another word to use as an illustrious title.  Bitching and moaning and
castigating the journalists is not going to help.  Somehow, also, the
new title has to be fed to the press in contrast to the Hacker image
and popularized.

As one who could probably lay claim to that "illustrious" title, I find
it repugnant.  It brings to mind an image of someone holding a bloody
meat axe.

The original WARNING !! msg was about an artical in the Wall Street

Did I miss a message in here?

RE:  Double spacing WS files.

If you have Mailmerge try this undocumented feature:

       The .LS is for line set.    The source file can remain single

Subject: Prgrmr nds HELP!


Hi all.  I got a question for CP/M programmers:  How can I find out the file
name of the program that was called from the CCP?  I.e., I run, a program
called, say, X5, and the first thing this program wants to find is "X5"
someplace.  This is so the program can create data files called "X5" with
different extensions, but the program name can be changed along with all the
data file names and everything will still work.

The first place I thought of was the FCB the system must have used to open the
program.  I did find it, but it is in a very machine (or implementation)
dependent location.  The challenge:  How can I do this in a CP/M-standard way
that'll work on any CP/M?  

Note: It's not in the low-memory parameter-passing buffer - that buffer starts
with the first characters AFTER the file name!  Grrrr!

HELP!!!!

Subject: Re: KayproII upgrade
Cc: IAIPS-DCAS@USC-ISI.ARPA

I have a 1982 vintage Kaypro II with the Pro8 upgrade and four half height
drives - two DSDD, two DSQD (all Teac) which has also been upgraded to 5 MHz.
I have had virtually no problems with this combo.  I installed a switch which
allows me to set either the Double Density or the Quad Density pair as "A"
and "B" drives.  It is therefore possible for my machine to act like a KP 4
with the flip of a switch.  I do not recommend leaving yourself with no 48 tpi
drive, since the 96 tpis are not completely compatible with the 48s, and if
you want to be able to exchange disks with other machines you need a 48.  My
understanding of the problem is that a 96 drive cannot completely erase or
write over a 48 track.  The 96 doesn't care, since it has a narrow head and
only sees the track it writes (although it can read a wider track by reading
just the middle of it).  However if you take a disk which was written on
with a 48 drive, then write over part of it (say the directory!) with a 96,
and then try to read it again with a 48, the 48 sees some of the old track
along with the new track and gets garbage.

Any way, that's what I did, and it gives me about 2 1/4 meg of floppy stor-
age on board my Kaypro.  Then I added a 1 meg RAM disk.......

NetLandians,

Has anyone else experienced problems with the TOPS-20 file transfer program
MODEM when working through a TAC?

I've tested the latest from SIMTEL20 PD:<CPM.TOPS-20> (I think .315), and
same problem as the one on my host.

Symptoms:  With two different versions of a micro MODEM using Christensen
Protocol (MODEM901 for the Compupro and MDM730 for my Decision I CP/M),
same error:  Incorrect Record # (or was it Header #).  Program never
begins to download.  Watching and capturing the mainframe MODEM packet,
I see with a DUMP two ASCII 01 characters as a leader.

MODEM used to work for me quite a few months ago, but now no luck.
Uploads ("Sends") also fail -- MODEM first returns an ASCII 87H, and then
as I recall, CRs and sometimes a NAK.  No packets move.  Both Checksum
and CRC fail.

I experimented with toggling my TAC Trap (sending the TAC intercept character
twice), but to no avail.

Sure has me bugged!  Would appreciate any help/suggestions.

David Kirschbaum

First off:

*** FLAME ON ***

Andy mentioned that "whoever doesn't back up his files gets what he
deserves".  I think that this idea is ok to a point, but he overlooks
one thing:  restoring 900 files is going to be a real pain even if you
DO have them backed up!  The real problem is the jerks that think this
kind of stuff is funny!

*** FLAME OFF ***

I have already outlined what I think could be done about trojan
horse software problems, but I don't know if it got to the net
or not (possibly just slow turn-around time for me to get my
copy back....) so here goes again:

   1) downloaders should take precautions when testing ANY unknown
      software found on a BBS.  Use a scratch disk.  If you have
      a hard disk you can disconnect...disconnect it!  Etc....

   2) BBS managers could put untested software into a different
      directory/user-area than tested software.  I know they
      can't spend all their time testing things, but if there
      are two seperate areas, downloaders could have a better
      idea of what they're getting!

Any comments on these ideas?

Hi,
Most of the programs I've seen DID in fact use the FCB down in low memory,
and it appears NOT to be hardware-specific : that's a sacred part of the
CP/M organization and seldom is perverted (except for Turbo Pascal, which
eats all after the 31st byte or so).

Starting beyond the program (e.g. X5 FOOBAR.TXT) is NOT so terrible -
heck, your program knows what its name is, doesn't it?  Simpler, just gobble
chars until you hit a space.

But as I recall, if you just grab everything starting at 080H for 128 bytes,
that should be the full "command tail".  Starts with command tail length,
maybe a space or two, the command tail itself (consider it a string),
and terminated (as I recall) with a 0.

Look at any of a number of .ASM programs that type, list, display, squeeze,
.. almost anything, and grab that command tail chunk of code.

I'm getting close to firing up an RCPM/RBBS myself, and kind of wondered
about something that maybe relates to anti-Arf! actions.

Why do sysops not insist on source code only?  Why would a user/donor only
want to upload a .COM or .OBJ file?  Sysops then have problems with
copyright infringements as well as the deadly Arf!

Someone with practical experience could probably answer this.
I for one NEVER (well, not unless I absolutely have to) download a .COM or
.OBJ file - heck, too much to learn (and maybe to modify) in that .ASM or
.PAS or .BAS source!

I have had so much trouble with the TOPS-20 MODEM program for the
past two  years  that  I  finally  gave  uponit  and  use  KERMIT
exclusively  on  the net.  Nothing I or the ECLB folks did seemed
to help.  Tried all of the TAC settings, too.   KERMIT  works,  I
recommend  it.  (If using binary file transfer, set the TAC using
the command sequence @@d c a, @@b o s, @@b i s first.)

Subject:  Modem programs for CP/M System ???



Thank you to all out there who responded to my request for use of 8" SSSD 
CP/M facility to assist in my acquiring modem program(s) for my CP/M machine.

I have now obtained copy of Modem7 suite of programs and am configuring
overlay patch for my system.

Some of you requested details of my CP/M system and I have included the
details below:

	System is a "PULSAR" Little Big Board LBB computer which runs a 4 Meg 
        Z80 under CP/M 2.2, 3.0 or TurboDos 1.3 operating systems. Board size
	5" X 8". LBB has two serial ports and 50 pin floppy connector on board
        and requires a serial terminal for operation.

	Floppy disc drives are 1 x 8" and 2 x 5 1/4" (8" lookalikes) which can
	read/write to standard IBM 3740 SSSD or 1.2 meg Quad DSDD formats.

	System uses STD bus but Little Big Board can be used stand alone if
	there is no expansion facility required.

	I have a 10 Meg 68k"CHS" Co-processor system attached through my Z80 
	running CP/M 68 with a 3/4 Meg Ram card. This allows me to toggle back
	and forth between my Z80 and 68K systems quickly. The Ram card is
	accessible to both systems and makes for very fast processing.

	The facility to still use my old Z80 CP/M software, especially 
	Wordstar, and other CP/M utilities on the same machine as the 68K is 
        certainly extremely handy. The 68K CPU card talks to the outside world
        via an interface card which is plugged into the Z80 CPU (LBB) socket.
        The Z80 then plugs into the interface card and the 68K board uses all
        the Z80's IO facilities. I have not had any experience with a 
        dedicated 68K system so I can make no comparisons as regards speed 
        but it certainly works extremely well.

Now for the plugs

1. I have no association with CHS but I  recommend their add on 68K systems.
   They now have a 3 Meg Ram card (same as mine with 256K chips which I must
   get around to doing too one day??) and in addition to the Z80 coprocessor
   for all of you who are sick of your slow old IBM PC or clone there is a 68K
   plug in for those machines called the PRO 68. The claimed performance is 
   out of this world. I have some benchmark data for any interested parties.
   Operating systems which are supplied with all CHS boards are CPM68K and 
   OS9/68 (UNIX look alike).

   For anyone who requires a faster machine (state of the art CPU ?) but does 
   not want to fork out for a 68K Sage or Pinnacle (I am not sure of spelling)
   and who is attached to their old CP/M machine and software this may be an 
   alternative. I purchased mine in Australia and consequently cannot help
   you with where to get more information on systems performance, prices or 
   whereabouts of CHS. (somewhere in or near NEW YORK city or state ?????)
   ( If CHS is listening all donations to the make N.M. BURMAN a millionaire
     fund will be graciously accepted )

2. I have an association with PULSAR COMPUTERS. It is run by a friend of mine.
   I can recommend their systems but I am *biased* they make a range of STD 
   BUS and stand alone Z80 A, Z80 B and 80186 single board computers and
   associated system boards in board only, fullkit and A&T form. These single
   board system are available from Pulsar Australia and I can give any
   interested parties limited documentation and approximate prices as well as
   an address to write to for enquires.

Finally I hope that during my 15 month stay here in the US I can get to meet
or at least converse on the net with as many people as possible. My apology to
anyone who may feel the above comments are too commercial for INFO-CPM.
Someone did ask about my system, however, and I was only too happy to comply.

I already replied to Dave and the INFO-MODEMXX list, but forgot to
include INFO-CPM.  The problem is that beginning with the current
version of TOPS-20 MODEM, you cannot simply take our .EXE file and
expect it to run on your machine.  In fact, I shouldn't have left it
in that section.  The reason is is that there are conditionals which
depend on features in the TOPS-20 MONITR to handle network binary mode
negotiations.  Our MONITOR does it differently than it used to.

What you need to do is grab the source file and compile it.  If it
still fails to work properly for you, let me know, and include the net
address of your machine's wizard.

Because:

1) The donor may wish to be the 'clearinghouse' for his/her program
instead of having a hundred modified versions floating around.

2)Donated software may be a preliminary version of a future commercial
product. This is a convenient way to get a program tested and obtain
feedback, so everybody wins. Of course this doesn't mean the author has
to give away the whole show (source code).

BITnet is a store and forward 'mailnet'.  I do not know of the design
configuration, but it may very well be like USENET, which is a 1200
baud dial-the-next-computer-down-the-line-and-ram-the-messages-to-it.
The systems may be hardwired together.  Anyhow, a LOT of colleges and
universities are (almost overnight) now on it and they can all send
user mail to/from each other.   The farthest I have seen BITnet go
is to a medical school in Germany.

The DDN (ArpaNet/MilNet) 'feeder' is a host called WISCVM.ARPA that
is both on the DDN and BITnet which acts as a mail gateway.

The problem with BITnet and the other mailnets is that it is ONLY
a mail message system.  The mailnetters constantly want to know
how to access/FTP (DDN/INTERNET TCP/IP Host-to-host File Transfer)/etc
like they read about the DDNers cross logging into other systems
(TELNET) and transfering files from the public domain program 
directories and such.  It can't be done.   Mailing the programs
is greatly frowned apon also due to the loading it causes on the
mailnets.

Well, I hope this info might be what you are looking for.

Cheers,
Gern

Thanks for your response, but I think you missed the point.  I want the
program and its data files to be renamable.  Then the .COM file will find the
data files by looking for the extensions (which remain constant) with the same
name as the .COM file.  And at 080H there is definitely no file name, just the
command tail.

If you know where the command name/FCB/File-name-as-typed-in is stored, or how
to find it, please drop me a note.


thanks,

Subject: Kermit on NEC 8001
To: info-cpm@AMSAA.ARPA
cc: info-kermit@CU20B.ARPA

Some time ago there was a complaint that the Generic version of Kermit
only partially worked on the NEC 8001.  I had reason to need it recently
and found the following fix which works quite well.

Generic Kermit uses the iobyte to switch to the BAT console (which takes
its input from the RDR device) so that it can check the serial port input
status using the Console Status BIOS call.  The BIOS therefore must check
the iobyte twice in this situation, once to determine that the BAT console
is in use, then again to decide which physical device RDR is set to.  The
NEC 8001 does this for the Console Input routine, but not for Console Status.
The default Console Status routine always returns No Input Available, so
that Kermit never tries to receive a character even though it can send them
just fine.

The solution is to patch the dispatch table for the Console Status routine
so that it proceeds to the serial status routine instead of the default.
It might be hard to determine the address of the status routine if RDR is
set to the PTR, UR1, or UR2 device, but for the TTY device the address is
just two entries earlier in the table to be patched.  Fortunately Kermit
uses the TTY device by default.

On the NEC 8001, the serial driver is loaded dynamically, and the address
of the status routine varies depending on which driver is used.  Therefore
this patch must be made each time the system is cold-booted, after installing
the serial device driver but before running Kermit.  It's easiest to make
the patch into a simple program using DDT as follows:

A>DDT
DDT VERS 2.2
-A100
0100 LHLD 1		; get the address of the BIOS jump table
0103 INX  H		; step forward to the Console Status entry
0104 INX  H
0105 INX  H
0106 INX  H
0107 MOV  A,M		; get the address of the Console Status dispatcher
0108 INX  H
0109 MOV  H,M
010A MOV  L,A
010B INX  H		; step past the dispatcher's initial JMP instruction
010C INX  H
010D INX  H
010E MOV  C,M		; pick up the address for the TTY Status routine
010F INX  H
0110 MOV  B,M
0111 INX  H
0112 INX  H		; step forward to the BAT entry
0113 INX  H
0114 MOV  M,C		; save the TTY address in the BAT entry
0115 INX  H
0116 MOV  M,B
0117 RET		; return to CP/M
0118 .
-^C			; Now get out of DDT
A>SAVE 1 KPATCH.COM	;  and save the patch as a COM file

With this patch program available, perform the following sequence of
actions after cold boot to bring up Kermit:

A>INSTALL8 IRS232A TTY: [,,,,O]		; install the driver as device TTY
					; set up for Object files.  The driver
					; name may vary.
A>KPATCH				; Patch the BAT status routine
A>KERMIT				; Start Kermit

With the interrupt-driven serial driver in place, this has worked perfectly
for me at up to 9600 baud.  Good luck.

   Flame on ME?  I merely suggested that keeping backups would help in a Tro-
jan Horse situation -- I -certainly- didn't mean to say that anyone who doesn't
keep backups "gets what they deserve".  I emphasise keeping backups only be-
cause it's a (more or less) "foolproof" way to be sure you don't lose your
files.  I've lost my HD driectories numerous times by just trying to install
ZCPR3 and modifying the CCP, etc.  Backups, even though it takes up a lot of 
time on a HD and can get costly, are still my most common ways to prevent
files, be it a Trojan Horse or careless mistakes when modifying the CCP.  Sorry
if I gave you the impression that people who don't keep backups get what they
deserve.

In-Reply-To: <KPETERSEN.12138712382.BABYL@SIMTEL20.ARPA>

The MODEM.EXE from simtel20 is set up to use special monitor changes
in their monitor that do things "right according to MRC" (Eg IAC
doubling, special MTOPR for setting Telnet binary mode).  This of
course doesn't work on most tops20s - be sure to get the sources and
set proper assembly conditionals, rather than just FTPing new binaries.

There are basically three types of tops20 monitors:

1) Hacked monitor - doesn't do IAC doubling at all.  This allows
   MODEM and KERMIT and so on to do their own telnet negotiations,
   and tehrefore work, as long as they also remember to double their
   own IACs too.  Unwary programs may have characters mysteriously
   disappear when they try to output a 0FFh without this doubling.
   I think Vanilla DEC software looks like this - it is the most
   likely version for your arpanet tops20 system to have.

2) Broken monitor - does IAC doubling (or tries to), but doesn't have
   MTOPR for setting binary mode on tcp telnet connections.  In order
   for this to work with modem at all, you have to do @B I S, @B O S,
   on your TAC by hand, which you can not then turn off.  This was
   a result of trying to fix type 1 monitors, without allowing for
   the fact that user software was counting on the "bugs".  There is
   also a REALLY BROKEN monitor that refuses to enter binary telnet
   mode at all, but this version has hopefully dissappeared.

3) Panda (MRC) monitor.  Does IAC doubling, but also provides a
   special call for negotiating network binary mode.  This version
   is probably the closest to "correct", but doesn't have very wide
   distribution (the edits are "Panda Proprietary"), and suffers
   somewhat in terms of efficiency.  SIMTEL runs this version.

There has been quite a discussion on info-cpm as of this date regarding a
standardization of a cliche' term for computer criminals, with the above
three being suggested as appropriate so far. I feel this would be a good
idea, so as to combat the media phrase "hackers", which is not only
inappropriate but deragatory to the amateur and professional computing field
as a whole. Could we get together on this? I would like to suggest a poll,
taken by a responsible system/person from netland as a whole, with the results
accepted by all.  I am aware that this may be an off-the-beaten-path 
suggestion, but I feel with the rising tide of discovered computer crime, it
is now an appropriate time to get together and have an appropriate nickname
for these dastardly fellows, so that "hacking" as a expression may be
restored to it's former glory(?). Comments, ladies and gentlemen?
I, unfortunately, cannot do this myself, as our system cannot handle that kind
of load. Any volunteers?

Hal - Bitnet is a service of EDUCOM.  Bitnet, CSNET and one or two others
are all services of EDUCOM.  If I remember correctly, all of the EDUCOM
net services are based on RSCS (IBM for Remote spooling....(?)).  There is
a gateway between CSNET and Arpanet (I believe it is at WISCVM or was
it CSNET-RELAY?)  A bitnet user cannot FTP or TELNET to an ARPA/Milnet host.
It is my understanding that it is just an email gateway.

If the resources the Bitnetter wants is the SIMTEL20 archives, depending on
what and how much they want, you may be able to "mail" it to them.  Otherwise,
Frank Wancho (Wancho@SIMTEL20) might generate one or more tapes.

Hope this helps.

Thanks for your reply.  The only possibility I've gotten so far is (in a
vanilla CCP) to get contents of 0006H and subtrace 7FEH from it.  This is
supposed to be some kind of command line or FCB thing in CCP.  Do you know
anything about this?

I am not aware of a way to resolve the problem of identifying the command
line verb for a program under standard CP/M.  This is one of the first features
I put into ZCPR3 ... ZCPR3 supports an External FCB which is at a memory location
you can find via the Environment Descriptor, and it contains the name of the
last command executed.  A program can look at this and determine its name.

The address your are referring to (the address of the BDOS-7FEH, where
the BDOS entry point is obtained from locations 6 and 7) is an internal
command line buffer used by the CP/M 2.2 CCP.  Some commercial programs
and some older CP/M 2.2 PD programs used to stuff command lines they wanted
to execute here and then enter the CCP in the proper fashion to have it
execute them.  This buffer does contain a command line verb,
but there is also an internal pointer that was set before the command line
was interpreted to tell the CCP where to begin processing.  The command
line does not have to begin at the first byte of this buffer.  I think
you are coming close, tho.

Backup or no backup, anyone who intentially posts anything that
intentionally destroys information, and misrepresents it as
something worthwhile deserves the greatest prosecution the law
allows, and the parents should be responsible for the actions
of their malicious (sp?) little brats if they try to hide
under "juvenile".  Maybe make them pay for re-entering and
verifying all of the data (they have to figure out how to verify
it if no backups are avail.  They destroyed it.)

PS:  Any proceeds from the brats book go to the Olde Programmers
Home and Relief Fund.  (S)He don't get nuthin'.

Subject:  CONIX


I am considering adding a UNIX-like shell to my CP/M system. I am
currently looking at CONIX and ZCPR. 

Would any of you with experience with either of these or with
recommendations for alternatives please reply to me at

	HAAR.GMR@CSNET-RELAY  (or HAAR@GMR if you are on CSNET)

I will forward replies to anyone who is intested or to INFO-CPM
if there is enough interest.

The features that I am looking for are:

	- compatible with CP/M 3.0 at the BDOS level
	  (retains banked memory and disk caching)

	- compatible with all CP/M software that uses
	  standard system calling conventions

	- provides I/O redirection in a UNIX-like fashion

	- hierachical, named directories

	- automatic path searches including overlay files

	- shell command language including variables, conditionals,
	  loops, and nested shell scripts

I would appreciate any information you can provide.

I am in dire need of a CP/M-based hard disk-to-floppy large file backup
utility that allows files larger than a single Apple 5-1/4" (126k) floppy
to be backed up on several floppies.  I was planning to write one in Turbo
P or BDS C but I thought there might already be something handy out there.
I need to back up large data files from a Corvus hard disk running Omninet
Constellation II software.  This system does not recognize other hard disks
(Sider, etc.) or large storage devices, only other Corvus disks or tapes 
($$), and regular floppies.  Any suggestions?  (I don't seem to be able to
get to Simtel20, by the way).

			Many thanks in advance,

					Jeff

I have been doing some work for a friend who bought a NEC 8001 (?) cpm
system second hand, complete with software and no manuals.  I've been using
the LYNC terminal program to talk to Unix VAxen, but really need some file
transfer (and wholly functional terminal emulation) capabilities.  Could
someone out there help me with lync information?  I've banged on control
keys till my fingers are numb, but haven't discovered how to get through to
any configuration/file transfer menu's.  Right now, I don't even know what
it's trying to emulate !!!! Even the address of whoever sells lync would be
a huge help.

				THANKS !!!!

Jeff,

Seems to me back in the old SIGM archives (early disks, down under 150
as I recall), there was something called BIGCOPY .. anyway, permitted
a huge file to overflow to a second disk.  Never did figure how you were
elegantly supposed to put those fragments together again - don't recall
if the program(s) did it both ways or not.  Give me a little time and I'll
try to dig itout.  Never used it since I use 8" floppies myself.

Subject: Turbo-Kermit on Ampro Little Board
To: info-cpm@AMSAA.ARPA
CC: ABN-ISCAMS@usc-isid.ARPA

There is a Turbo-Pascal version of Kermit floating around for the
CP/M-80 systems.  For those who might have tried it on an Ampro Little
Board and been unsuccessful in getting it to come up, try changing the
assignment of the variable "port" from:
        port := 2               to:     port := 0
  The Turbo version uses some fancy switching of the IOBYTE to convert
from the console to the RDR/PUN device.  In the Ampro, the normal hard-
wired definition for RDR/PUN is Serial Port B which is the standard TTY:
device.  The Columbia version evidentally uses UR1:/UP1: which becomes
the BAT: console device when switched in for status reads to the console
device.
   With this one equate fixed (in the main K.PAS module), terminal oper-
ation with the "connect" command works.  There are a couple of other
assignments that need to be fixed in the port configuration section, but
I haven't sorted it out yet.
   If someone has used this program to transfer binary files to/from a
BBN C-70 Unix machine, I would appreciate any info on settings in both
programs, since I still can't get that to work yet.

Does anyone have some general-purpose software UART

Hokay...
After much testing, hex dumping, switching between Kermit and MDM730+,
I have finally beaten the particular problem with my particular TAC when
trying to download binary files with the Tops-20 MODEM program.

Nuttin wrong with the MODEM program! (Well, nothing much.)  Despite NOT
having any "flow control" set on the TAC, and despite what the MODEM
program is supposed to do to set up the TAC .. you MUST command the TAC
to disengage flow control with:
@@F O E
@@F I E
before the Tops-20 MODEM program can work.  Yep, it takes BOTH flow
controls like above - without either, you'll get the "Incorrect Record
# in Header #n" message.

Kermit, of course, has none of these problems SO LONG AS you have not
SET flow control with the usual
@@F O S  or
@@F I S

Uploading still fails, with my system receiving sporadic NAKs - could be
the hapless TAC's buffers overflowing, altho my Wizards of TACiness
(got that from Europe) say it has the new improved 128-byte buffers, etc.
So... Kermit for uploads, and finally MODEM for downloads.

Thanks for all the help, guys.

Kevin,

I'm gathering sample Public Domain software to do the very same, but am
slightly involved right now bringing up MODEM and Kermit on a new PC system.
I've been downloading the RBBS files from SIMTEL20
PD:<CPM.RBBS> since they look like the most powerful.  Also have some
Turbo Pascal code lying about in my MAST.CAT that is also an RBBS.

Nothing running yet, but not long now.  If no one else with actual
experience volunteers, your friend and I can learn together!
I'm running a CompuPro dual processor with MP/M 8-16, but suspect I shall
just bring her up under CP/M-86 or CP/M-80 for this particular function.
