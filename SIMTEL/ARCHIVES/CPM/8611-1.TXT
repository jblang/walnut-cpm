Subject: NSWP207

After bombing with NSWP208, I got this version (207) from SIMTEL20. I
am having three troubles.

1.  NSWEEP207 does not seem to accept a file-spec as JCL.  I can type

	NSWEEP207 *.mss
     
    and I will get the same thing as if I type

	NSWEEP207

    I also have trouble using a drive-spec, so that

	NSWEEP207 b:*.mss

    gives funny results.


2.  NSWEEP207 does not seem to want to View files for me.  I get the
first few lines of the file, and then I get what appears to be a
display of the directory (i.e., lines with some ascii text in them and
some garbage, and the ascii text is filenames on that drive).

3. The squeeze function creates a larger file than the original, and
isn't even squeezed.

In case it is relevant, I am running this on M/PM 8-16, on a hard
disk.

help?  

Thanks..

I have indeed been biten by the same bug several time, and have written a
termcap and a terminfo for the 128.  The main problem is that the C-128 isn't
really an adm-341 emulator as much as a Kaypro emulator.  The <ESC>G#
codes are different, which causes the alt char set to be used instead of
inverse video.  Here is the termcap that I am using on SysV.2 UNIX's:
---------------cut here--------------
c128|c128.mex|cpm128|commodore-128 cp/m+:\
	:co#80:li#24:am:cl=\E*:bs:\
	:cm=\E=%+ %+ :nd=\014:up=\013:ce=\ET:cd=\EY:\
	:al=\EE:dl=\ER:im=:ei=:ic=\EQ:mi:dm=:ed=:dc=\EW:\
	:so=\EG4:se=\EG0:us=\EG3:ue=\EG0:
----------------------------
Its not absolutely complete, but its better than trying to use the ADM-31
and going blind.  The terminfo (available on request) is more complete and
based on a look at the terminal emulation sources in the CBM release.

I just uploaded RDMS233C.LBR to SIMTEL20:

Filename			Type	 Bytes	 CRC

Directory PD:<CPM.C128>
RDMS233C.LBR.1			BINARY	 47104  BA48H

This is an adaptation of RSMS 2.33 (from <CPM.DSKUTL>RDMS233.LBR) for
the Commodore 128 running CP/M 3.0.  This program will allow reading
of any of the 4 MSDOS format diskettes, copying files to CP/M format
diskettes.  This is only useful for copying text (program source and
doc included) and data files - MSDOS .com or .exe files will not run
under CP/M!!!

From:        Rob Olson <GA.OLS%ISUMVS.BITNET@wiscvm.ARPA>

I have a strange question for any of you with long memories:
   I picked up a Xerox 850 stand alone word processing unit a
while back that I am trying to get to work with a CP/M system.
Requests made to Xerox on my behalf didn't return much and I think
that this is the place to reach the people I need...

1) I'm trying to get the printer part to work with my system by
installing a standard interface on the printer unit itself.  The
connection to the box has resisted my attempts with a scope to
figure out what is going on.  Any information on a pinout would
be wonderfull...

2) I am trying to use the 8" drives as the base for a new CP/M
system that a friend is developing.  The drives are Shugart SS/SD
with a Xerox board instead of the original from Shugart!  Anybody
know what this beastly does.


   Since this is not of general interest, please reply directly to
me.  Thanks for listening.

2)Is there a p/d terminal program and an assembler that will run on 
cpm 80?  I am new the cpm world and am not real sure what else is
available.  Does anyone have a list of what is available and what is
the best assembler for cpm either p/d or otherwise.

Would it be possible to get a copy of the actual Applications note for the ^s fix.
I would like to see what was done to get around the problem.

Thanks in advance.

While having the SIMTEL20 archives is a truly wonderful thing, it is less
than reliable for me.  I have requested a couple of files as many as 3 times
(requests separated by at least a week) without getting any response from
them at all.  Other files I have received parts 2 and 3 of three, and never
gotten part 1.

Maybe I am doing something wrong?

It would be very nice to have a *reliable* source...

The source is only as reliable is the mail routes when using the
archive server.  Host "seismo" has blocked any messages originating
from the server because they do not wish to handle the mail traffic it
generates.  You must use a path other than seismo.  Here are some
that work...

To obtain up to five files in a single request message by netmail from
the public domain archives kept on SIMTEL20.ARPA, send a message to:

ARCHIVE-REQUEST@SIMTEL20.ARPA, or via uucp:
...!ucbvax!simtel20.arpa!archive-request
...!uw-beaver!simtel20.arpa!archive-request
...!decwrl!simtel20.arpa!archive-request
...!lll-crg!simtel20.arpa!archive-request

The message body must contain lines beginning with the keyword SEND,
one SEND line for each file requested.  Case is not significant.

The general syntax of a SEND line is:

SEND format filename

In general, a filename consists of the following components:

device:<directory>file.type.generation

"device:" is usually PD:, and the combination of PD:<directory> is
expected unless an alias has been advertised of the form "alias:",
which takes the place of both device and directory fields.  The
generation field may be left off and defaulted to the highest
generation number.  "file.type" follows the usual filenaming
conventions.

In all formats listed below, if the file to be sent is larger than
55K, the file is sent in numbered parts.  The parts must be
reassembled in order and edited to remove any headers, preface, and
trailers before the process can be reversed to reconstruct the
original file.

Allowable formats are:

SEND HELP
        This file you are reading now.

SEND INFO
        A detailed description of the SIMTEL20 Archives, which
        includes this file, pointers to certain key files, and
        descriptions of various file transfer programs and related
        utilities.

SEND BOOTSTRAP
        A brief quick reference listing of filenames of the key
        utilities used to reconstruct files sent by the compression
        and encoding techniques listed below.

SEND DIR filespec
        This format returns a CRC list of the requested files, and is
        the only format which allows wildcard filenames (but not
        wildcard directory names).  The list is sent as an ASCII text
        file.  The wildcard characters are "*" and "%".  The asterisk
        means any number of characters, while the percent sign means
        exactly one character.  Either or both may appear in any
        combination in either or both the file or type fields, while
        only the asterisk may appear in the generation field.

SEND RAW filename
        If the file is ASCII, it is sent as-is, regardless of size.
        This format is the least efficient over network and mail
        gateway resources.  Use this format only if you absolutely
        must.

With the four formats listed below, if the file is ASCII and under 25k
characters, it is sent as-is, as if RAW format was requested.  Binary
files are always processed according to the requested format.
However, a request for ARC or SQ processing of files with type .ARC,
.LBR, or .%Q% is ignored and the original file is either uuencoded or
hexified (if possible), according to the requested format.  If the
file was not sent RAW, a short preface is inserted at the front of the
message describing the process actually taken and a CRC entry
describing the original file.

SEND ARE filename  or  SEND filename
        The original file is made into a uuencoded ARC file.

SEND ARH filename
        The original file is made into a hexified ARC file if the ARC
        file is under 64K bytes long.  Otherwise, an apology is
        returned instead of the requested file.

SEND SQE filename
        The original file is made into a uuencoded SQueezed file.

SEND SQH filename
        The original file is made into a hexified SQueezed file if the
        Squeezed file is under 64K bytes long.  Otherwise, an apology
        is returned instead of the requested file.

To get started in finding your way around the SIMTEL20 archives, send

Subject:        Help with BRADFORD needed


I am having problems with BRADFORD, the letter quality printing program,
which does not appear to run on my machine. I have got the version from
SIMTEL20 (in PD:<CPM.LIST>BRADFORD.LBR). The program starts O.K. with
the sign-on message and the first prompt (enter filename:), but after
typing in the name of a file present on the disk, there is some disk
activity and the system just warm boots - no error messages.
Has anyone else encountered this problem?
My machine is a 64K Amstrad CPC464 (probably unknown in the States, but
very popular here in Europe).

user system ever developed for the home user.  If there are any other users
left out there, please EMAIL me.

A couple of us here have decided to dump all the overly-complex operating
systems we've been playing with at home (AmigaDOS, Micronics (and other UNIX
look-alikes), MPM, etc.) and do our hobby computing on OASIS.  We would LOVE
to get into a software exchange with other OASIS users.

If you want to respond, please use EMAIL, as this is being posted on some

This newsgroup is being renamed from net.micro.cpm to comp.os.cpm.
This renaming will gradually take place over the next few weeks.
More and more messages posted to this newsgroup will be aliased
into the new newsgroup as they pass through the net, and people
will begin to post to the new group.  After a few weeks, the
old name will be removed.

This note is to inform you of the renaming so you can begin to

The problem could be in your path, (some are simply more reliable than others)
or you could be addressing your requests wrong. They are to be sent to
ARCHIVE-REQUEST@SIMTEL20, not ARCHIVE-SERVER where the programs are sent
*from*. Hope this helps.

Subject: N* Advantage = Dumb terminal?
To: info-cpm@AMSAA.ARPA, info-micro@SIMTEL20.ARPA
Cc: rbloom@APG-1.ARPA

I'm trying to use my NorthStar Advantage (a all-in-one computer) 
as a dumb terminal to a TurboDOS system.  The problem is that 
every commo package I've tried so far is too slow for any speeds 
higher then 1200 baud or so.  I want 4800 baud minimum, 9600 baud 
desired.  (19.2k? dream mode on)

I don't need *any* facilities in the way of file handling, just a 
basic terminal with editing (cursor control, clear screen, 
insert/delete line, inverse video - which are all provided by the 
video driver anyway.)

The modem7/mex overlays are not fast enough - or more properly, 
the computer does not execute the video driver bdos/bios calls 
fast enough.  The effect is characters are lost, most commonly 
one or two after a linefeed.  The 'host' TurboDOS does recognise 
the DTR line and stops output accordingly if DTR drops.  The 
Advantage i/o also can be interrupt driven (but is not under 
cp/m).

I've written a tiny commo program that does nothing but ship 
characters to/from the modem port from/to the console 
output/input via IN/OUT and bdos func 6.  All my attempts to 
control DTR to avoid character loss has been unsuccessfull.  (I 
don't know how to write a interrupt-driver or I would have tried 
that too.)

So, has anyone tried/done a hack for the Advantage to allow 
serial i/o at speed above 2400 baud?  My normal dealer says max 
is 1200 baud and won't help further.  With a cooperating host 
(i.e. acknowledges the DTR line) I'm sure higher speeds are 
possible.  But how?

Having used the N* Advantage in past years, I can testify that a major
part of your problem is simply that it is not a very quick computer.
This is especially true of it's screen.  On this basis I must sadly
say that you may not get much more speed than what you currently have.

    I'm trying to use my NorthStar Advantage (a all-in-one computer) 
    as a dumb terminal to a TurboDOS system.  The problem is that 
    every commo package I've tried so far is too slow for any speeds 
    higher then 1200 baud or so.  I want 4800 baud minimum, 9600 baud 
    desired.  (19.2k? dream mode on)
...
    The effect is characters are lost, most commonly one or two after
    a linefeed.
...
This is a common problem with any memory mapped display that is updated
by the host CPU.  The problem here is that any line feed that requires
the screen to scroll (e.g. <LF> on the last line) will need the CPU
to move EVERY character on the screen up one line then clear the last
line.  This takes a great deal of CPU time and while this is going on
the CPU can't poll the port to check for new incomming data.  Here are
three solutions that I've used in order of ease to implement.

 1.  Have the host send PADD characters (or pause time) after it sends
     a <LF>.  (note clear screen takes a while too)
 2.  Write interupt drivers for the COMM port that fills a buffer that
     the term program goes to when looking for input.
 3.  Write your own screen driver that looks at the comm port after
     each single line is moved, and buffers any waiting data between
     it's moves.
 (4) Get a terminal or new system! 8^)

Using any of 1-3 I've gotten an AVERAGE throughput of about 80K baud!

I would like to interface an IBM-type keyboard to my Osborne Executive.
The keyboard puts out a TTL "ascii-like" serial bit stream and my
computer expects to see an 8-bit parallel input on the keyboard port.  I
imagine that someone has done this sort of thing before, maybe even some
company that offers an IBMPC-keyboard-to-8-bit-parallel conversion

this.

First off, the IBM keyboard sends serial data of key number NOT ascii.
It sends the key number when the key is pressed, then sends key#+80h
for key release.  For info on an adapter see Micro/Systems Journal issue
July/August 86, pg 34.

Yes, there is a program called CRUNCH (and companion UNCRunch) which
does Lempel-Zev-Welch style file compression on CP/M-80.  It is far
more efficient than SQueeze/UnSQueeze which uses the Hoffman
algorithm.  The efficiency of CRUNCH exceeds that of MSDOS`s
ARC512.EXE utility.

[Flame on] - Too bad the authors of LU and NULU never released the
source code.  We **COULD** have had a combined LBR/CRUNCH which would
have been better than MSDOS's ARC files.  Another stifling of software
expansion/development caused by those who will not share the basic
tools we need to keep CP/M alive. [end of flame].

    What is Draco, Why Did I Write It and Why Is It Like It Is?

    I usually describe Draco (pronounced Dray-ko) as a "systems
programming language". That means that it is a language which is
suitable for what I think of as systems programming - writing
operating systems, compilers, editors, databases, etc. This doesn't
mean that it isn't suitable for other applications such as writing
games, graphics programs, numerical programs, etc. It does mean that
the language has all of the facilities needed for the former type of
programming, such as bit operators, pointer manipulation, support for
complex data structures, etc.

    What is different about Draco? I won't try to compare it with
every other programming language in the world; instead I'll stick to
two of the most popular ones for micros nowadays - C and Pascal. Draco
has all of the facilities of C, except for bitfields and the macro
preprocessor. Unlike C, and like Pascal, it is a strongly typed
language. This means that it won't let you assign an integer to a
pointer (unless you really insist). It is also not an expression
language like C, thus it makes a quite strict distinction between
statements like "a := 27" and expressions like "a + 27". Pascal is
strongly typed, but lacks many of C's facilities - pointer
manipulation, bit manipulation, standard separate compilation,
conditional compilation, etc. I like to think that Draco combines the
best features of both languages.

    Visually, Draco doesn't really resemble either language closely,
but is a little closer to Pascal than C. It uses ':=' for assignment
and '=' for comparison, like Pascal and unlike C. It's structure and
union declarations are like those of C, however. As a simple
comparison, here follows the same program, written in Pascal, C, and
Draco:

Pascal:

    PROGRAM test(INPUT, OUTPUT);
    VAR
        i, j : INTEGER;

    BEGIN
        FOR i := 0 TO 10 DO BEGIN
            FOR j := 0 TO i DO
                WRITE(j : 2, ' ');
            WRITELN
        END;
        WRITELN("All done.")
    END.

C:

    #include <stdio.h>

    main(argc, argv)
    int argc;
    char *argv[];
    {
        int i, j;

        for (i = 0; i <= 10; ++i) {
            for (j = 0; j <= i; ++j)
                printf("%2d ", j);
            printf("\n");
        }
        printf("All done.\n");
    }

Draco:

    proc main()void:
        int i, j;

        for i from 0 upto 10 do
            for j from 0 upto i do
                write(j : 2, ' ');
            od;
            writeln();
        od;
        writeln("All done.");
    corp;

    First, it's clear that the C program has lots of brackets, while
the Pascal and Draco programs have lots of keywords. A significant
difference, not very clear in this small example, is that Draco uses
different keywords for each job, rather than relying on a single
construct (the BEGIN - END or '{' - '}' block). I greatly prefer
keywords, finding them easier on the eye. I also prefer languages in
which the use of case (UPPER v.s. lower) is available for my own
purposes, rather than having them equivalent as in most Pascals. Also,
note that the Draco program uses 'upto' in the 'for' loops - this
tells the compiler that the loop will be counting upwards; 'downto' is
used for downward counting loops. C doesn't really have a semantically
different 'for' loop - it's is just a kind of shorthand for a 'while'
loop.

    Some of the inadequacies of Pascal from my point of view are as follows:

    - no standard separate compilation
    - no conditional compilation
    - no general string mechanism
    - no pointer manipulation
    - no bit manipulation
    - I HATE BEGIN and END!
    - no signed/unsigned types
    - limitations on function and argument types
    - procedure calls don't use '()' - they look like variables
    - no typed, named, constants
    - no available, decent implementations (fast compilation, good code,
        nice libraries, good error reporting)
    - I/O semantics that are poor for interactive programs
    - no file inclusion or module specification facility

    Some of the inadequacies of C from my point of view:

    - too many bloody brackets!
    - horrible declaration syntax (just what is "char *(*p[])()"?)
    - error prone conventions (how many times have YOU written '=' when
        you meant '=='?)
    - non-portable I/O (if you don't believe this, take a look at the
        open calls on CP/M or MS-DOS versions of C, where you get to tell
        it what it's supposed to do with '\n')
    - potential for extremely unreadable code (misuse of macros, etc.)
    - slow compilers (as I've heard it, the reason that the original UNIX C
        compiler for the PDP-11 generated assembler source was so that the
        compiler writers didn't have to worry about long/short branch
        optimization, since that was done by the assembler. Producing
        assembler source is just plain slow. Those who argue that they want
        to hand edit it to improve it are crazy!)
    - lack of much type checking (I prefer compilers that tell me about my
        dumb mistakes. This a lot better in the ANSI draft version.)
    - inefficient standard setup - passing everything as 16 bits on an 8
        bit CPU isn't so hot
    - stupid linkers - why add all that code I'm never calling?
    - no built-in I/O - this makes even the simplest programs large
    - no typed, named constants

    All of these issues have been addressed in the Draco language and
tools.  Just as important to me is the quality of the tools (compiler,
linker, etc.)  The Draco compiler goes from source code to
relocatable, optimized machine code at a rate of about 2000 lines per
minute on a 5 MHz 8085. Working from one 8" floppy disk, the entire
compiler (about 10,000 lines) can be rebuilt in under 10 minutes. No
other compiler I've heard of for CP/M can do this (at least not and
produce good code). The linker will link small programs in one quick
pass, and won't load any code that isn't referenced by the program. A
simple "hello there world" program is under 1000 bytes.

    Another reason that these programs exist is that I LIKE writing
compilers and stuff. I'm up to about seven compilers now, the latest
of which is a C compiler that should meet the ANSI draft standard
(it's a huge monster written in C, but at least I was paid to write
it!)

    So I've written my very own personal compiler, that does things
just the way I want; why should anyone else want to use it? Put
simply, the Draco package (which includes the various libraries I've
built up) is possibly the most effective way to produce compact,
efficient code for CP/M systems. In the past couple of years, asside
from fine tuning the compiler, I've written somewhere around 20,000
lines of Draco code, including the screen editor I'm typing this into,
a complex graphic role-playing game, several CRT-oriented games for
CP/M, ranging from the trivial to the quite complex, a database
package, a text processor (with a friend), a modem program, etc. If
you want to program a CP/M system, whether for fun, profit or
whatever, and are willing to learn another language, then I feel that
Draco is a valid choice.

    To be fair, I will end this intro with a list of things that I
find are lacking in the this version of Draco:

    - essentially non-existant floating point support
    - no proper modules (although Draco goes about half way to providing a
        usable kind of module)
    - no bit oriented type (I haven't yet fully convinced myself that this
        is needed)
    - error handling is considerably better than most C compilers I've
        heard of, but it could still use some improvement
    - object code can ALWAYS use improvement, but the improvements that are
        left would either be difficult or of little actual benefit and
        would probably make the compiler too big to fit on standard CP/M
        systems

and, of course

    - Draco is supported only by me, and available only on the systems that
        I choose to put it on (currently CP/M-80 and Commodore Amiga,
        although the Amiga version hasn't been widely released yet)

			About the Draco Disks

There are 3 disks in this set:

1 - documentation - writeups on the language, tools, programs, etc.
	Also contains lots of sample Draco sources.

2 - compiler - contains the compiler, linker, assembler, disassembler,
	librarian, cross-referencer, libraries and include files

3 - programs - contains programs which must be configured using the CONFIG
	program: several games and the editor


All material in these ARCs are supplied "as is" with no warrantees or
guarantees of any kind. The tools, especially the compiler and linker,
have been heavily used and should be fairly bug free. Some of the
games have known glitches.

All material in these ARCs is supplied as "copyrighted shareware".
This means that you can use the supplied material as you see fit, and
you can give away copies of the disks to anyone, so long as the file
named "README.TXT" is included in each ARC. The author retains all
other rights to the software.

This software was originally intended as commercial software, and some
of the writeups reflect this orientation. Due to the lack of a viable
market for CP/M-80, character based software, this software is now
being distributed as "shareware", in which user's are requested to
send a suitable donation to the author if they feel the software
merits it. Such contributions can be thought of as encouragement to
the author to create and release more software and more versions of
the current software.  Currently under way is a conversion of the
compiler to generate MC68000 code. The immediate target machine is the
Commodore Amiga. Soon to follow that is a comprehensive graphics
adventure system originally written for CP/M-80 using the Compupro
"Spectrum" graphics board.

I reliably use Mex 114 at 38.4Kbs, so I doubt that the fault
lies in the program itself.  I'd suspect either the overlay or
the hardware itself before I'd worry aut the program.

PISTOL is a Portably Implemented Stack Oriented Language that is a cross
between STOIC and FORTH.  Version 2.0 of PISTOL for CP/M-80 (in BDS-C) and
for the DEC-20 (in PASCAL) can be found on SIG/M volume 114.

I am in the course of converting the PASCAL version over for VAX/VMS, and
perhaps to Turbo Pascal [ please - no inquires, I'll post news here once
I'm done ].

My purpose here is two-fold: 1) to inform people about the code (a prior
fig-forth in C that was widely discussed turns out only to be good under
UNIX/bsd because you use the stream editor to install it; BDS-C is weird
but at least it's C); 2) HAS ANYBODY ALREADY PORTED PISTOL TO OTHER MACHINES
OR KNOW OF A MORE RECENT VERSION OF THE CODE ?

Thanks.

     I have been using ProLink 1.5 for a few weeks now. What a fantastic
program! Goodbye LINK, L80, and all the rest.

     However, I have one problem. The multiple command separator ";" is the
same as my CPR, thus I can't pass more than one command to the linker.

     Is there a simple way to change the separator to something else? I run
into this problem frequently with software that does things like this... ZCPR3
gets in the way.

Netlanders,
	I am in the process of reorganizing some Kermit code and I find
that my job would be simplified by a public domain relocating assembler,
preferably with Z80 mnemonics.  Output would preferably be in Microsoft
format, but any format is acceptable if a linker is supplied.  Source code
would be nice, but not manditory.  Any suggestions?

The problem shows up on DRACO-2.ARC and DRACO-3.ARC.  Both ARCs
extract perfectly with the MSDOS ARC512.EXE or PKXARC.COM programs.

I have notified the author of the CP/M UNARC program, Bob Freed.  He's
going to look into a fix.  It's somewhere in the UNcrunch routine.
I'll keep you posted on his progress.

Hang on to your DRACO ARCs.  They ARE good.

I just uploaded a new Commodore 128 program to SIMTEL20.

Filename			Type	 Bytes	 CRC

Directory PD:<CPM.C128>
UNIDRIVE.LBR.1			BINARY	 20480  1690H

UNIDRIVE-128 is a Commodore 128 CP/M disk utility in the spirit of the
MSDOS program UNIFORM(TM).  The normal C-128 BIOS only supports 7
different MFM disk formats.  UNIDRIVE-128 allows the user to select up
to 10 of 24 different CP/M 5.25" MFM diskette formats (seems like
every CP/M computer system ever manufactured used a different
format) which can subsequently be read or written by CP/M 3.0 and the
Commodore 128 BIOS.  This, of course, only works if the 128 is
equipped with at least one Commodore 1571 disk drive.  This is the
first release; subsequent versions will support many more diskette
formats and will (hopefully) be able to "format" diskettes
corresponding to these formats too.  Read UNIDRIVE.DOC within the
library for more info.

Sincerely,
Frank Prindle

All my attempte to mail you the KERMIT and XMODEM files failed.
They were all returned after 7 days with an unable to deliver after 7 days message.

The next best option is to mail you a floppy with all the files.
Send me your postal address and I will mail the needed files.
Do you think there is a customs problem in doing this?

Subject: Lost Mail from the Archive Server

First of all, please address your requests to
ARCHIVE-REQUEST@SIMTEL20.ARPA, *NOT* ARCHIVE-SERVER.  That latter
address is what appears as the Sender in the replies you receive.  If
you reply to that reply in the hopes of getting more files *and* your
mail program is misimplemented in that it forms the header using the
Sender: field, rather than the From:, your message will be
bit-bucketted when it gets here.  In fact, ALL mail addressed to
ARCHIVE-SERVER, including mailer reject notices, is being discarded
unseen by any human.

Secondly, as of this past Saturday, we were forced to reduce the size
of our host tables to improve Internet performance - the host tables
share the same section of memory with the Internet free buffers.  This
rather drastic reduction was accomplished by removing all host aliases
from the distributed table, along with all host entries which do not
advertize at least one TCP service: FTP, TELNET, or SMTP.

What this means is that if you are sending a message through an
Internet host which is not using its Official Host Name, or does not
advertize one of the TCP services listed above, do not expect to see a
reply from us.

Finally, I have noticed several messages coming to us from hosts which
are not even listed in the original host tables we receive from NIC.
These hosts are probably registered under a Domain.  However, we do
not have access to a domain lookup service at this time, and we don't
have the resources to implement our own.  If your request come to us
from such a host, do not expect a reply either.

One more thing: several weeks ago I patched our mailer to keep trying
to send mail hourly for five days instead of three.  This has helped
somewhat in getting mail through to hosts which are taken down for a
weekend or the long three-day weekends.  It has even helped in getting
replies back to the BITNET requestors via WISCVM, but not completely.
I understand that work is in progress to try to reduce the volume of
mailing list mail through that host in the hopes of increasing the
chance for other mail to get through.  What I have seen is that only
parts of multi-part replies from the server getting through, requiring
the requestor to re-request *all* parts of the file.  There *may* be
an extension made to the server, after the first of the year, to allow
for selected parts to be sent.

We are also waiting for some disk space to be freed up so that the
latest releases of the PC-BLUE collection can be uploaded.  We expect
that to happen after the first of the year also.  Meantime, patience.

    Last week I had the dubious good fortune to acquire three old
computers, sans software or documentation.  If possible, I would
like to get all three of them up and operating and keep the best
one for a word processor.  The three are:

    1. North Star Advantage with 15 MB hard drive.
    2. Ontel 1505/OIS 1500 (OP1/15) with 5 MB hard drive.
    3. Sanyo MBC 1000 with one DS/DD floppy drive.

    I have a CP/M boot disk for the Northstar, but I do not have
the Hard Disk Operating System (HDOS).  I would appreciate any
leads to operating systems, software, or documentation for any of
these computers.  I would especially like to find the plug-in
board that reportedly enables the North Star to run MS-DOS
programs.  I have also heard that there is a program that allows
the North Star to read/write soft-sectored diskettes.  Thanks in

Does anyone out there know the details of the compression algorithm(s) used
by the CRUNCH/UNCR programs?  I would like to incorporate UNCR functions
into my IBM (mainframe) utility, but have been unable to decode the crunched
files.  The older versions of the program pair claimed to used LZW, but
its a completely different variation from ARC.  The latest version of CRUNCH
uses GEL(?) compression.

Perhaps someone can send me the source for CRUNCH/UNCR formerly distributed

Help.

     I find I have to write an interrupt-driven application for 
the NorthStar Advantage.  Unfortunately, I don't know how.  
Specifically, I do know how to enable the interrupts, and write 
the interrupt handler, but actually what happens at interrupt 
time eludes me.

     At the interrupt, the z80 jumps to the interrupt routine.  
Where?  My z80 book says, "the z80 expects an [RST or CALL] 
instruction to be placed on its data buss [by the interrupting 
device]"  how it do dat?  Two people who I asked said "to where 
you program it to" but I have no idea how to do that.

     I have a Advantage technical manual.  It may have the info I 
need but I find it incomprehensible.  (I gather that interrupt 
routines are strongly hardware-dependant.)  And I do understand 
that the Advantage is not very fast, but can't believe a simple 
get-and-put routine with interrupts wouldn't be fast enough for 
4800 baud.

     So, can someone help me out?  I'm trying to store the input 
characters from the SIO card away till they can be processed.  I 
have DTR control on the port but I haven't been able to get that 
to work.  (I'm trying to write a very simple high-speed commo 
program.)  I really need a low-level example.

crckk.c  --  CP/M version of the Unix version of the CP/M utility crck
             Version 3.0

Usage:
    crckk [-t|c|u|i] [filename ...   (wildcards OK)  ]

  Calculates a 16-bit cyclic redundancy check on its input files and
 prints the resulting number in hexadecimal.  CRCK(K) is manually invoked
 on two versions of the same file to ensure that they are the same.
 Prints the the filename, size in bytes or sectors depending on the
 option flag, and the CRC.

 This program produces the same check number as do "CRCK" programs,
 the extra "k" in this program's name is for identity-control. This is a 
 different program from CRCK.ASM (currently in version 4.4) used in
 the CP/M world now.

 Options:
     -t    Perform CRCK on a CP/M text file that is stored as a CP/M
           file. CTL-Z is used as valid EOF.

     -u    Perform CRCK on a regular CP/M file.  Takes whatever is there.

     -c    Perform CRCK on a CP/M ".COM" file. Same as -u flag,
           except sectors are reported rather than bytes.

     -i    Perform CRCK on a CP/M ".COM" file stored in ITS binary 
           format.  Same as -c, but ignores the first four bytes of file.

     If no option flag is chosen, the default option is -u.

   1.  This version actually runs a fair bit FASTER than CRCK44 !!!

   2.  Has the true-text "t" option.

       This is good for downloading text files (like shar files)
       from UNIX. If you download a text file "as is"from UNIX OR,
       your modem program doesn't "fill with multiple CTL-Z's",
       then there's a problem matching the CP/M CRCK with the UNIX
       version of CRCK program.  With this option, this crckk "-t" will
       match the "plain" UNIX crck for unadulterated text file transfers.

   3.  User-interface is a bit friendlier and/or more UNIX-like.

       a) Invalid dash option (like crckk -z) will give verbose
          help/error message.

       b) Multiple filenames as parameters are allowed.

       c) Each filename can be wildcarded.

       d) Each wildcard expansion is sorted.

       e) Standard-in is allowed source ("< filename")

       f) Output list can be redirected to file using standard output
          (" > outputfile ").

       g) Error message(s) can be redirected into standard error.
          (" >> errorfile").

       h) Pipes are also allowed (but in general not too useful except
          for with other CP/M programs that are suitably compiled).


   NOTE:  I didn't write this program, but I did make rather substantial
          changes to the original UNIX version.  Some changes were for
          functional reasons (the -t option), but mostly for huge
          speed-performance reasons.  My original port was slow as
          a dog (not released).  This version is VERY fast.

Hello 

I've been able to get stuff from simtel20 but...
I've asked for uudecode and unarc and they have been sent uuencoded & arc'ed
is there any kind soul out there who could send me the two programs or
point the way to getting access to them ? email please.

There was a person on who was looking for a way to use his Northstar
Advantage for a dumb terminal. I have such a program unfortunatly I
do not have the source as I got it before I realized the need for source
if you will email me mabe we can work something out.

thanks

I drew SIMTEL20's attention on the problem he describes.
I ran into the same difficulty.
The directory PD:<MSDOS.STARTER> is supposed to contain the triggering stuff.
PD:<CPM.STARTER> should be its CPM counterpart.
But they only contain binary files of no use to those with no binary retrieval.
Even the only source piece which is supposed to uudecode does not work with
the otherwise welcome added M SIMTEL20 adds to each record.
So I modified it for my own use and posted it to SIMTEL20. I got no answer
so don't know it it is there. In the meantime I got an ARC on diskette, so I
did not experiment the whole triggering process. But at least the following
program does uudecode, slow etc..., is easily convertible and a first step.
Here it goes....

OK, here is my fuzzy recollection of how interrupts work on the Z80:

There are three interrupt modes on the Z80 - 0, 1, and 2. The mode is selected
by executing an IM instruction whose operand is the mode desired.

Mode 0 is the 8080-compatible mode. The Z80 expects the interrupting device
to put a value out on the data bus which indicates what location to jump to.
Their are 8 choices - 0H, 8H, 10H, 18H, 20H, 28H, 30H, and 38H. The processor
executes a CALL instruction to one of these locations, which contains either
an interrupt handler (if it can be handled with only 8 bytes of code) or a
JMP instruction to another location which contains the interrupt handler.

Mode 1 is the simplest mode. All maskable interrupt requests are vectored to
location 38H via a CALL instruction. This mode is equivalent to executing an
RST 7 in Mode 0.

Mode 2 is the most flexible mode, with full vectoring to any location you 
want. In this mode a priority is established among peripherals which can
generate an interrupt. This is done by daisy-chaining the peripherals through
the IEI/IEO pins. Whenever a device generates an interrupt, it pulls its
IEO output low. Also every device in the chain monitors its IEI pin. If this
pin goes low, then the device is disabled from producing interrupts, and the
device will again pull its IEO pin low. In this way, devices farther down the
chain are prevented from interrupting the processor while it is servicing a
higher priority interrupt.

Once this happens, the device puts an 8 bit vector on the data bus. The Z80
reads this vector, which must be programmed as part of the device's initial-
ization, and concatenates it with the contents of the I register. This register
is set to be the high order 8 bits of a 256 byte vector table. This table
can be located anywhere in memory - this is what your friends mean by "it's
wherever you put it". The 8 bit vector from the peripheral points to one of
the 256 locations in this table, which contains the start address of the inter-
rupt handler. You can have several of these tables in memory and switch back 
and forth simply be changing the contents of the I register.

If this is still confusing, e-mail me any specific questions you have and I'll
try to answer them. As I said, it's been a while since I did any Z80 stuff and
my memory is a little fuzzy, but I'll do my best.

I've heard that Hollywood Computers does work on them - anyone

I'm sure you msg has been long answered, but I want to make sure.  HSH15 should
do exactly what you want for command recall, and you can set the cmd-line-limit
yourself from the command line.  Works GREAT and FAST on my old sa-1004 rigid,
and adequately on floppy.  Condition:  you must have at least one element in
your shell stack free to run it (nothing major).  Good luck, and sorry it took
this ling to reply, but I was away from work and they archived my mail... first
chance I've had to get back at it.

     VCED16 should also do the trick, although it's a bit slow on a floppy.
It really flies on a ramdisk, though. Only there when you want it, and it
can be installed as an error handler too. What else could you want?
