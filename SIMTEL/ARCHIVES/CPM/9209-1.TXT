Subject: format for Digital Research CP/M 2.2 distribution disk?
Message-ID: <9209011441.AA16789@tmpcu.mdc.com>

I recently purchased the original Digital Research CP/M 2.2 that was mentioned
here earlier this summer.  The main reason I bought it was for the manual, but
the other members of the CP/M SIG and I would like to play around with the
distribution disk.  All the disk says is that it is in "Xerox" format.  Well,
one member's Xerox 820 wont read it and wont boot it.  Anyone out there know
what format to select in one of the format conversion programs (Uniform, 22disk,
etc,) to read this disk?

Thanks in advance for your help!

I have a Sony Model 35 Series 10 system the has 2 3.5" drives in it. I
am looking for some 
software to drive a modem that also can boot itself or I need a boot
disk also.

The machine currently only has some word processing software for it, but
I would like to
use it as a terminal. So, if anyone has or knows where I can get it (ftp
or otherwise), please
let me know. I also am looking for a cheap 2400 baud modem that will
work with this setup.

Thanks

I use both QTERM and kermit 4.11 on my kaypro II as terminal
programs. QTERM has a command to hang up the modem (^\,) which
doesn't seem to work. Has anybody been succesful in hanging up
the modem on a kaypro II? I was told that the problem is due to
an unusual wiring scheme in the machine. Thanks,

Did you try them?  I think 360K disks should work in a 720K drive.
Your mileage may vary.

I've used 360k floppies on my 720k drives and they work fine.
Unless you're using real old floppies that are barely qualified for
double sided, modern floppies are quite capable of the higher track
density.
I once calculated the bit densities for track-to-track and
bits along a track.  Even at double density, the density along
a track is significantly higher than track to track.
I've done quite well with the bulk floppies.
You should not be spending more than a quarter a piece.
(heck - I've bought 8" double sided floppies for a dime each,
and I've recently been getting them for free).

	Both carry 3M 747-0RH, which is a 5.25" quad density diskette

Under DOS I could format standard 360K 5-1/4" disks to 720K with a programm
called FDFORMAT.

Hello out there in networld! I have just aquired an NCR DecisionMate V
computer, and need some help with it:

Although I have boot disks and CP/M manuals for it, I have no users
manual for the actual machine itself. I will send what it costs to copy
your manual if you have such a machine...

Second dilemma: the machine came with no I/O ports, I believe these are
plug-in modules for RS-232 and Centronics Parallel. Does anyone have any
spares of these, or know where I can obtain them? Alternatley, if you
can send me a schematic for them, I can produce my own. (Pre-fab'd parts
preffered though.)

There is also a curious DB-9 male connector on the right-hand side of
the keyboard... can anyone tell me what it is used for?

Much Thanks in advance for anyone who can help!

BTW, I am also looking for a good communications package for the NCR
too!

Last I knew, Radio Shack sold them ... but the price was NOT cheap.  Note,

them this way a lot, but have never had problems with those I have tried.

Subject: The easiest way to convert formats
Message-ID: <9209020357.aa29394@WHARF.BRL.MIL>

Hello.

May I suggest that the easiest way to convert formats (I do it quite
often) is to execute the job on one of those PC's which are anyway
idle anywhere.  There is a program at the Simtel PC archive and its
replica named 22DSK that does it splendidly. It reads/write just about
any format from ready made tables, and if you have one very strange
format you can expand the table for your case. It won't work with hard
sectored diskettes nor with diskettes written with the Motorola
controller chip found on the old timer Commodore C-64 or Apples.

I also have the Media Master package on CP/M, which costed me some
money, but I never use it, as it is so more convenient to transit on
a PC with 22DSK.

May I add to the veritable flurry of CP/M systems being offered for
sale??  I have had no mechanical/electronic problems (or, for that
matter, modifications) with the Osborne 1 (SS/SD) I bought about ten
years ago.  Used it for relatively lightweight word processing, and,
more recently--very lightly as a terminal to the local "BIG" computer.

I don't have any idea as to the market value (but wondered if the
Boston Computer Exchange even "lists" Osbornes any more?....), so will
be glad to hear from Osborne enthusiasts who may need a working machine
for spare parts, as a backup machine, or whatever with offers to
purchase!!  [Please, I'd feel badly accepting anything over $10,000 :-) ]

More details:
      Grey case Osborne 1, 64K, two floppy drives
      All original copies of software which was included:
            Wordstar (v.2.26?)
            dBase II (never used!!) complete with _two_ manuals
                and a keyboard template
            SuperCalc
      Blue-cover paperback user's manual Osborne
      Townsend, Carl, _Using dBase II_, Osborne-McGraw-Hill, 1984
      Miller, Alan R, Mastering CP/M, Sybex, 1983
      IMP (communications) software "ready to go" with cable included
      2 dozen or so floppy diskettes

      whatever else I can find that will fit into the original box and
packing material.  If you're not interested in buying this package, but
have an opinion as to its value, I'd be glad to get a brief message, but
it's too late to convince **ME** as to the relative merits of CP/M over
DOS.  I just don't have the time to dig into the guts to get CP/M to do
what I want it to--more or less on my own.

      Please respond directly--there's no need to clutter up INFO-CPM
with responses (this is too long already!)

know it exists because I used to do it regularly four years ago. 
Unfortunately, the software dreamed up by a developer here no longer
works for me, I suspect because my operating system on the Macintosh is
too new.  I've tried all the old o.s.'s I could get hold of and nothing
works.  Currently I use Macintosh system 6.0.8 on Mac Plus, SE-30, and
LC.  Grateful for *any* help.

Can't you just use standard 1.2MB floppies on a 720k drive?
It seems since the media is the same, it should work.

 Sorry, the media are distinctly NOT the same!  It is unlikely that the
 720 drive could even successfully format the disk - much less write data 
 to it.  The 1.2 floppy requires a much higher magnetic force to write 
 to it.

If it were, you could. But it isn't.

1.2MB floppies are High Density.  720K floppies are Quad Density.  360K
floppies are Double Density.  Now it turns out that the media currently
used in 360K floppies copes with 720K format (more tracks, no higher bit
density in the track) better than 1.2M floppies (which expect a higher
bit density in the track).

I've had better results with 360K floppies than I've had with 1.2MB
ones, and they're cheaper too :-)

I suggest that if you still have your CPM machine up and running, why not use a communication program to do the transfer.  More than likely it will be easiler than getting another piece of software and it should be fairly quick. Many CPM boxes will allow you to run the comm port a 9600 or 19200 (of course KAYPROs are the exception). I've used this approach for years and I've been very successful at it.  Rarely have I not been able to move files from one machine to another. Now if your CPM box nolonger work

Does anyonew know of a CP/M make utility for use with Makefiles?  And if
not, I guess I should port one or something.  I would imagine that it could
use the Archive Bit of the filename to keep track of what modules are
current.

BTW, I have Aztec Manx C, which is quite good for K&R, but it just doesn't
include a make utility.

Not quite. There *IS* a difference in media between IBM 1.2 meg
disks and IBM 360K disks / Quad density 720K disks. If you don't
believe me, try taking a 360K disk, and formatting it to 1.2 megs.
OTOH, as has been noted you can format 360K disks to 720K (or even
800K) in an IBM 1.2 meg drive: I have a couple of utilities to do
this, and use the 800K format for all my archival backups. It
provides by far and away the best cost per megabyte: 25 cents for
800K works out to about 32 cents per megabyte.

Apparently some of these 'quad' density disk drives are sensitive about NOT 
having hub rings on the floppy. You will notice that High-Density floppies
do not have these rings...

So, is there a source of fairly high quality DS/DD floppies WITHOUT hub rings,
for those of us that plan to format and use these disks as if they were Quad
density disks?

I use both a 4/84 and a 4+88 to work with the internet.  The obstacle you
will encounter is that your host machine may not have software that works
gracefully with the Kaypro.  Some editors presume function keys; some
host software does the same.  The problem lies not in the Kaypro but in
your host mainframe.

If your systems people cannot help you out with an editor and/or support
for the ADM-3A that the Kaypro emulates, perhaps you can find a keypad
redefinition program (several were available for the Kaypro at one time)
that will allow you to program the function key codes into the numeric
keypad.  I'm not sure if it is possible, but it is certainly worth a try
if your host system won't support the Kaypro.  Good luck.

I've written Yet Another CP/M disk conversion for the PC which I think is
pretty keen.  It installs as a device driver instead of being run as a
standalone program so you can manipulate files right off your CP/M floppy
instead of copying them to an MS-DOS disk first.  The drive letter it gives
you can be accessed like any MS-DOS drive, but reading your CP/M disk.  
This would be especially handy when you're running a CP/M emulator like Z80MU
or looking at dBase files.  It is limited to reading only.

I'm finishing up the documentation now, so I'll have a beta test version
ready Real Soon Now.  If you're interested in beta testing this program
(called CP/M Reader), let me know and I'll send you a copy when it's ready.
It currently has about 40 or 50 different disk formats built-in, so it 
should work on just about any 512 byte per sector MFM format disk.  I only
have my own computer to test it on, so I can only say that Superbrain disks
work like a charm (except for my disk alignment problem, grrr).

I'll post a notice here when it's out of beta test.

Hub rings have nothing to do with the density, capacity, etc.

The reason hub rings are not needed on the high-density drives, is that
the drive spins on inserting the disk.  The hub motion is
self-centering because of the rotation.

The older designed drives, the full-height ones, used varying tapers on
the clamping cones.   These drives did NOT rotate upon insertion, and
the hub rings were the added re-inforcment to keep the center holes of
the disks from crimping.

You could really crunch the older disks too, as the drive was done via
a belt and you could really get some torque going in comparison to the
direct drive units.

I had disks (in the 1979/80) era that would spin in the full height
drives, but would not in the half-height direct drive units.

     Sure, Bill, except that you made an implicit assumption which in my

a PC on my OFFICE desk. To follow your recommendation I would need to leave
the PC powered up at all times, to inflige a modem to any person calling me
when I am out of office, to deny phone calls to my family, and to work much
slower than you say with the old 1200 bauds modems which I own. Instead, when
I need a copy here and there, 22DSK on the PC does it instantly!
By the way in the CP/M archives at SIMTEL20 (not MSDOS, CP/M), there IS a
program that works very well on my Lobo to read/write in PC-compatible
format, I just forgot its name.

Mix Software, 2116 E. Arapahoe, Suite 365, Richardson, TX, 75081, used to

and use Turbo C for the DOS environment.  Only minor compatibility
problems, and they usually arise when I want do use some of the extensions
that Turbo C makes available.  The Mix C documentation has been worth the

for under $30, and if it is still sold it should be worth the price.

I hope you have received a number of replies by email, nothing has 
passed this way in this newsgroup.  

If Modula-2 is acceptable, there is a compiler package from Workman & 
Associates - since FTL was written in Queensland Oz, you might already 
know of this and have a more convenient source.  The CP/M version was a 
very reasonable price and there is a version for MSDOS and TOS.

For the language 'C', don't know of a really good public domain compiler 
package. BDS C isn't PD but is interesting ...

There have been about four different versions of 'make' ported to 
CP/M.  The source for one, in Manx Aztec C was written up in a 
back issue of 'Doctor Dobb's Journal'.  Perhaps you might check 
the Periodical Index to find the right volume of DDJ, UofWaterloo 
has/had a fairly complete set of that magazine.  If they've done 
a housecleaning in the last decade, leave a message here with the 
volume number needed.
Good luck.

There is a shareware utility called Chameleon that can move both text and
binary files between DOS 3.3, Prodos 8, CP/M, and Apple Pascal.  Works great!
If you are using a super serial board and find a CP/M executable that talks
to it, I would like to know.  I have MEX and the SSB overlay, but have never
gotten around to trying to get it working.

That first one sounds like a machine I am currently trying to repair.

Does anyone have any technical information about the Altos 586?

My immediate problem is with the floppy drive.  I bought a replacement
floppy drive for the one that died while I was trying to replace the
crashed hard disc... 

The good news is, it is possible to boot up from the new floppy. 

The bad news is, the system will only read from the floppy if the drive is 
already spinning when the read attempt is made.  Eg, the first boot attempt 
fails, but the second works, as long as the second attempt starts while the 
floppy is still spinning from the previous attempt. 

The question: Is there some way I can wire up the floppy drive so that the 
motor is always spinning as long as the power is on?  (I realise this is a 
horrible solution, but it's the easiest I can think of) 

Or is there some sort of Drive Ready signal that I can fake somehow? Would 
any of the jumpers on the drive have anything do with it? 

The drive is 5.25" quad density made by Mitsubishi and it has jumpers on it
labelled MX, HS, HM.  There is a jumper in the HS position.


(I have cross-posted fairly widely, and redirected followups to comp.periphs
and comp.unix.xenix.misc, as this hardly qualifies as a folklore question)

Replies by email would be appreciated, as the system I am posting from
expires articles *very* quickly and I could easily miss something important.

Just to be nit-picky  :-)  720K 5-1/4" drives/disks are NOT quad density,
though they are sometimes incorrectly called that!!  The drives/disks are
DOUBLE DENSITY, but have twice as many TRACKS as a standard Double Density
drive/disk.

Check out C/80 by Software Toolworks, Sherman Oaks, CA.
As I recall, it had a "make" utility.

It went with their product C/NIX, a Unix-like shell for CP/M machines.
I played with it for a while, and it's great!
(It does for CP/M what MKS Toolkit does for DOS).

Sorry, no idea about current availability, etc.

Cheers,
Andy

I've got a copy of C/80 with the mathpack
for $30.00, I'll pay shipping in the US.
It works great, but we went to Archimedes tools at work.  I used
it on  a pc with z80mu.  A great combination.  You can single step
the code and debug without an ice.

Have you tried reading that diskette with 22DSK138's 5 different Xerox
formats? You can't harm your diskette with attempts to read it (protect it
first, one never knows).
In your place this is certainly how I would begin.

I think some of the Xerox 820 formats use a track 0 which is
single density. A standard PC floppy controller probably won't
read a single density track, since that pin on the controller is
not connected to anything. On the 22DISK DOCUMENTATION near the
back, it's explained how to modify a card to read single density.
With this modification, I've been able to read single density Osborne
and Heathkit diskettes.

Hmm,  So let's get this straight.  They are double track and double
density.  2 * 2 = 4.  4 times the density is NOT QUAD density.  Got it.

To pick a nit ....

The org CP/M disks I had were 10 hole hard sectors with 100K per side on
a single sided disk, basically DS/QD is 7+ times that.  The issue at
hand is DENSITY however.  Density meaning how tight the bits are packed. 
Tightly packing the sectors and increasing their size to 512 bytes
enabled us to get 180K on the side of a disk rather than the old 100K
functionality.  This basically put the "bits" almost twice as close
together on a given track, hence "double" density.  Doubling the number
of tracks brings the bits another factor of 2 closer together hence the
term "QUAD DENSITY" diskettes.  QD diskettes were marketed extensively
pre-ibm and clone takeover for hardware such as EPSON, OLIVETTI, SEIKO
(Yea The watch guys sold computers!) and my Heathkit.  The AT&T 3B2 used
these puppies too.  Now the quality of standard IBM "Double Density"
360K media is so good it will work fine as 720K "Quad Density" too. 

The Current Crop of AT/HD stuff is even higher than quad, packing 15 512
byte sectors on a track instead of 9 a factor of 1.7 improvement in
density.  The 3.5" disks on the other hand STARTED at 720K which was
called "double density" so the 1440K 18 SPT 3.5's are now often called
"quad density" which is where the confusion may be from. 

The REAL density improvement on 5.25" has not "really" doubled though.

Single Density = 100K per side
Double Density = 180K per side really 1.8 density not 2
Quad Density   = 360K per side really 3.6 density but advertising you know. 
High Density   = 600K per side They didn't push to "HEPT" density on
		 this one :)

Again this is BIT density, nothing to do with actual storage mind you. 
Also the 3.5's really started out on the HD emulsions.  Now the NEW
stuff comming out is pushing 10MB on Standard floppy style media.  They
stopped "densitizing" the names (finally, thank god) and just say
"2.4MB" or "5MB" 5-1/4" media.

With a copy of AnaDisk you should be able to determine whether it is readable
on a PC, and the characteristics of the format - sector size, interleave, 
sector numbering, etc.

With that information, you should be able to 'build' a custom format identity
for 22Disk, and thus read the disk.

An alternative is to send the disk to Sydex, along with the 22Disk registration
fee, and they will 'build' the format identity for you.

I do not have the direct answer.  However, I have something which may be of
help to you, or be useful for general info:
In the appendix for Kenneth Heyda's "MULTI-SYSTEM 180 with ZCPR2.3"
there is a list of system format parameters for about 20 manufacturers.
I will copy it to here if desired.

E.g., XEROX 820 SD has 18 sectors/track, 128 bytes/sector, and is 
(of course?) S (=single density).
XEROX 820-II DD    has 17,               256,  and (of course?) D.
There is no other Xerox listing.

I know of one for 8086 machine running DOS but am looking for one that runs

Why? Because I have some CPM software that I run now and again but my

Any help would be appreciated.

With the exception of the Xerox 16/8 DEM, all Xerox floppy formats have track 0
formatted as single density.  While I fight with 22DISK to get it to work with
the Xerox formats, I HAVE gotten it to work.  Of course, it does not work for
Xerox 820 disks, since they are single density, and the controller in the PC
can't handle that (without modifications).

I may be way out in left field here, but if I remember right, the first couple
of tracks are reserved for the boot sectors, and there should be nothing for
22DISK to read there anyway.

Subject: KAYPRO W/ WORDSTAR
Message-ID: <1992Sep14.163014.1@vax1.umkc.edu>

I'm writing this on behalf of some friends.  What could be causing Wordstar on
a Kaypro to loose all digits and punctuation on the monitor after about five
minutes of operation?  The characters exist in the text file and print fine but
do not display on the CRT.  After about five minutes of operation these
characters are lost but the editing session can still continue with everything
behaving normally except for the display.  The digits and punctuation
characters disappear and are replaced by blank spaces on the CRT.  I'm sorry I
don't know more specifics on the machine and version of Wordstar being used,
but it was purchased, in the US, in the early 80's.  This machine has served
them very well in Spain, and now in the US.

I use Wordstar and CPM on my Apple ][+ and still like it very well.

They'd have to be less than twice the cost of the cheapest 360K
disk you can find to be effective. And that doesn't include the
cost of the hole puncher needed to run 720K 3.5" disks at 1.44 meg
densities.

Believe it or not, I've seen DSHD diskettes WITH hub rings.  In
fact, I have a few in my collection.

I guess a reason that HD diskettes have no hub ring is so then
the dumb-ass user can tell the difference between a "360K" disk
and a "1.2M" disk just by looking at it.

I've seen DSDD diskettes without hub rings, but those are a PAIN
to find.  I wouldn't waste my time worrying about those silly hub
rings.  Just get DSDD diskettes and get it the hell over with...

	No, it really is a Kaypro 1.  The Kaypro 1 was introduced
around 1985 or so.  It came after all of the Kaypro 2's.  A brief
description of what is has is: 64K, 2 Ds/DD disk drives, 2 serial, 1
parallel, came with CP/M and Perfect Writer.  It has what was called
the "Universal Roms", which was when Kaypro finally got around to
standardizing the roms in all of the machines.

	I have one of them sitting downstairs, along with an original
II'83 and all of the documentation if that can help.  I've also
cross-posted this to comp.os.cpm (which is why I left in so much of
the article.  Apologies to those who get concerned about that sort of
thing.)

I am looking for information about some Kaypro computer's

I believe these machines were called Robie machines or some

It sounds like the character generator EPROM is flakey and some of
the bits are failing.
There was a discussion on this in sci.electronics not so long back.

Try removing the EPROM and cleaning the pins if it is socketed, otherwise
resolder the pins.

good luck

There were two Kaypro manifestations of the Drivetec 3.3 floppy disk drive.
One was the Robie (Darth Vader's lunchbox), and the other was the 4X which
was the normal Kaypro box but with Drivetec's vice normal 360's.

Either version was capable of reading a 360k disk, *but*, only after booting
from the 3.3 disk.  Neither version was capable of writing to a 360k disk.

Message-ID: <ins279k.717045543@mdw039.cc.monash.edu.au>

Hi!

My Father, not being computer minded, paid too much for a Xerox cpm machine
at an auction not so long ago.

It came with NO disks, NO documentation and NO refund......
Consequently, he wants me to get it running for him so that he can do some
basic word processing, spread sheet and database work. (Nothing fancy, but
enough to keep track of bills etc. in his small business)

I know absolutely NOTHING about cpm and have only subscribed to this news
group to find out if the machine can still be used....

It is a Xerox machine (as already stated) with two 8" floppy drives, and a
pretty standard looking CRT. The machine has no visible model name or 
identifyable markings other than "XEROX" on it's crt case. The machine
displays the following message when it is first turned on...

	 XEROX 820 RX VER 1.0...
	 L - LOAD SYSTEM 

It has a printer port, comm port and the keyboard and disk drives also have
port connections going into the crt box where the cpu obviously lives.
I opened the crt box to see if there were any easily identifyable chips or
interesting helpful "other things" but not much made sense to me (what did
I expect?)

Does anyone know what sort of software runs on this dinosaur, & where I could
get it etc??? What disk format does it use?? Any information (useful or
otherwise) would be greatly appreciated!!!

Please e-mail me or post replies here...

Thanks.....martin  (ins279k@ccds.cc.monash.edu.au)

ps: sorry if this is a FAQ....

I long ago got rid of the best computer I ever owned , a rock solid Kaypro II.
I'm still getting by on stone-age stuff: a couple of 8088 XT clones. I have
just inherited another KII from a friend's closet which seems to be
suffering from failure to communicate with its A drive. Switch on, warms up,
CRT says put disk in drive. There is only the master disk, which I ASSUME is
not damaged, but the drive doesn't pay it any mind, or perhaps the board
doesn't pay the drive any mind. I opened up the case, admired the clean lines
of the interior, and swapped the drives, on the theory that A is broke and 
maybe B ain't. No response. Next move?

I have come into possession of a device made by Televideo, and would
appreciate any information anyone could supply.

I have found no model number on this computer, so I can only report that it 
is a self-contained unit, with a monitor mounted on vertical pivots.  Stacked 
to the right of the monitor are two 5.25" vertical disk drives.  The keyboard,
which attaches to the system unit with a coiled cable and modular telephone
connector, has a label that says "Tele-PC", and is laid out much like
the keyboards on the early IBM PC.

Of course, no disks or documentation came with this thing.  I'm guessing
it's a CP/M machine, but does anyone recognize it from the description?

Anybody have any interest in such a system or even the printer. The
printer alone has got to be
worth at least $150 (ribbons alone cost $120). This thing is taking up a
lot of space that I need
and really want to get rid of it. Please make some kind of offer.

	Did you also remember to swap the terminating resistor?  Also
have you tried cleaning the drives?  Also try it with just one drive

When you swapped the drives, did you change the drive select jumpers?  Does
either one of the drive LEDs come on?

   Probably not.  Z80MU does not implement a complete and accurate CP/M
system.  It does a good enough job to allow one to run most standard CP/M
application programs, but it cannot handle operating-system-level stuff.

   However, there is an extremely nice program by Simeon Cran of
Australia called MYZ80.  It creates a totally complete CP/M environment,
including the file system, and it runs anything that will run under CP/M. 
It took me less than a minute to have an NZCOM version of Z-System
running under it.  Look for the file MYZ80100.ZIP on BBSs and (I hope) on
SIMTEL20.  My 486 PC is now by far my highest performance Z-System
Z80/Z180 computer

Subject: Help with Televideo TS816
Message-ID: <1992Sep22.000833.20452@spatula.rent.com>

Hiyas all. For some time now, Ive had a TS816 that I didnt do much
with, so it sat around idle for about a year. Now the other day when
I went to power it on, it wouldnt boot. The belt slipped of the hard
drive, and when I put it back on, I fear that I spun the drive motor
in reverse. For those not familiar with Quantum 8" drives, this can be
A Very Bad Thing. (apperently what happens is the head is mounted on 
a sort of diagional, and when spun backwards, it gouges the platters)

So now I am in sort of a situation. When I first aquired the machine, I
used the tape drive to dump all the data onto carts, so I have a backup
of all the stuff. But, I cant boot it. The head arm goes into its 
jumping back and forth fits, and never arrives at the boot track. 
But, hopefully all is not lost. I have a spare Quantum Q2040 laying 
about (same size drive), that I can replace it with, but the problem is
getting a boot onto it. I know that the 816 can boot from a tape, but 
I dont have a bootable tape. Is there someone out there who could create
one for me, with the dump program on it (and directions, its been a long
time and I dont recall the command syntax) so I can restore it? I would
reimburse you with a replacement tape, and/or shipping, as you desire

Thanx!

In your situation I'd check out your boot disk.  You can do this on any MS-
DOS machine using one of several programs which will read and write the
Kaypro II SSDD format.  One such, which I have on my BBS (512-259-1261, the
Kaypro Club of Austin (TX)) is 22DISK, a shareware set of programs which
allow reading and writing of files to and from floppies using various CP/M
formats.  Another offering from the same company (Sydex) is ANADISK, also for
MS-DOS machines, which will check your boot disk for dead sectors.  Our BBS
offers assistance for Kaypro CP/M users, in as much as we can over the
distances involved.

Hi!!!

I've been told that the Xerox 820 cpm machine with SSSD 8" drives, is just
a Ferguson Big Board "in disguise". Is this true?? What's a Ferguson Big
Board??? 

My hidden agenda is that someone is willing to sell me software for my Xerox
820 which runs on his Ferguson Big Board machine. The claim is that the two
machines are identical.

Any help would be greatly appreciated.....

	Nope, it's not on SIMTEL20 yet, at least under PD1:<MSDOS.

Yes.  Much less.  From memory the price is AUS$30 (works out to about
US$25 I think).

I've had a brief play with MYZ80 and was very impressed.  The pop-up
"debug" window is very useful (ctrl-break brings up a window which
allows single stepping, etc).

I brought it up, in the default configuration, out of the box.  By
default it runs ZPM3 (a CP/M Plus clone) and works very well.  Utilities
are provided for importing/exporting from the CP/M drive, and there is
an API around for talking to the host machines hardware (eg, for serial
comms, printer, etc).

I would strongly recommend obtaining a copy and having a look at it if
you are at all interested in Z80 and/or CP/M emulation. Oh, BTW, it's a
true emulator - with a real BIOS, BDOS, and CCP - none of this "emulated
BDOS" mess.

Simeon Cran, the author, has done a very good job with both MyZ80 and
ZP/M 3.  I use ZP/M 3 on my main CP/M machine, and it works nicely and
is a bit faster than the generic CP/M Plus.  MyZ80 is also very fast.  I
got the impression that on my 286/10 it was an effective 2.5 Mhz Z80 -
very very good.

Subject: Televideo TS806/20 Info Requested
Message-ID: <jfoy.717670030@glia>

Today I was given a system that is tagged as TS-806/20. I'm assuming, at 
least for the moment, that it is a TS-806 computer with a 20 meg hard 
drive. (I know there's a hard drive but I've not been able to determine 
what kind it is yet)

The system came with five TeleVideo 925 terminals with keyboards.

According to what little info came with the system, it seems to run a 
network-type system called MmmOST with CP/M R 2.2.

Ok, the problems:

 1) No boot disk. (5.25" floppy drive so assuming this should be a 5.25" 
    floppy diskette -- about 368k I'd imagine.

 2) No cable for the hard drive. Two openings on the rear of the machine 
    are labeled WINCH (DATA)  and  WINCH (CONTROL). I'm assuming this is 
    where the cable is supposed to snake through.

 3) The cables for the workstation terminals had been severed so I'll 
    probably need new ones. They seem to be RS-422 D-style connections 
    (15-pins).

The questions:

 1) Where can I get a boot disk either with or without MmmOST? Cost?

 2) Where can I get an appropriate hard drive cable? Cost?

 3) Will any RS-422 cables work? If not, where can I get the right type 
    for this setup?


The sooner I can get this system online, the sooner I can finish up CP/M 
ZIP as my other CP/M system (BMC if800) bit the big one about three 
weeks ago.

Comments, pointers, tips, etc. are definitely encouraged.

Thanks for your attention. :)

Subject: Urgent - Info about communications abilities of a CPC6128
Message-ID: <9209251054.aa08910@WHARF.BRL.MIL>

Hello,

I have an Amstrad CPC 6128 computer, running CP/M plus. I want to access
my computer account in the university so since I already have this computer
I was wondering if I could use it as a remote terminal.

So:

1) I know there is a 'general expansion slot' where I could connect an
   RS 232 port. So i can connect it to a modem. But, someone told me that
   regular modems arent 'proper' for Amstrad. I know it sounds silly, because
   the RS232 port is a standard and modems just 'talk' to it, but before
   I give all those money for a modem, I wanna be 100% sure that it will work.
   So, will I have any H/W problems or I will just need regular modem?

2) S/W question:  What communications program will I need in order to
   establish the connection? I am wondering if there is something similar
   to the PROCOMM thing. Does anyone know any program that could turn
   my CPC6128 to a network terminal?   Can I find anything in some anonymous
   FTP site?    if not, is there anything in the market? does it provide
   vt100 emulation?

Please, if anyone wishes to answer I would appreciate if it will be
sent to me by private e-mail because I am not reading the mails of this
discussion group.

Thanks in advance

Hello everyone,
    I have two Victor 9000 computers from the early '80s, and was wondering
if anyone knew anything about them.  They run cpm/86 or ms-dos 2.1.
It appears that they are running an intel 8088 processor like the IBM pc,
but they don't seem to be fully IBM compatible.  I do know that the cpm
system works right.  But anyway, the question is, does anyone know anything
about these machines, have any software they will run, or any peripherals
with which they are compatible?  Also any idea on approximate value if I
were to try to sell these things?

Thanks

I think that the 'Winch' slots you mention are probably for an external 
drive.  There should be an internal one.  Also, on the back panel should
be a 25 pin connector marked Terminal.  On the machine that I have seen, 
this was for the 'master' terminal - the others were for 'slave' or 
'satellite' terminals.

I have a couple of disks with the MmmOST files on them, but neither are 
bootable.  I'd be very interested in a copy of a CP/M 2.2 system disk if
you get one, and also a bootable TurboDOS floppy if someone runs across
one.

The victor 9000 is an MS-DOS compatible, definately NOT IBM-PC
compatible. I knew someone who had one running. It can redefine
ALL it's character fonts, and this option is used in the
special basic to 'do' graphics (i.e. the value in the screen
memory indexes a (i believe 16x16 or 8x16 dot) bitmap array.)

I think it'll run a fair share of MS-DOS programs, but IBM-BIOS
compatibility is a problem...

Ed, is WordStar talking directly to the printer or is it going through
the BIOS (or BDOS)? I remember having this same problem when I was
using 4.0 on CP/M. Removing all the other drivers (ASCII, DRAFT, blah,
blah) helped me.

   It is basically true.  Jim Ferguson developed a very nice single-board
Z80 computer kit at a very attractive price.  That was my first computer,
and it was very nicely done.

   Two other computers used the basic Ferguson design: Xerox and Kaypro.  As
I understand it, Xerox did the right thing legally and ethically; they paid
Ferguson to design a similar board to serve as the basis for their personal
computer.  But they did the wrong thing technically.  They insisted on some
changes from the BigBoard design; all, as far as I could tell (I also had a
Xerox 820 for a while), made the computer worse!

   Kaypro, on the other hand, apparently stole the BigBoard concept. 
However, they did the right thing technically, introducing some nice
improvements (such as support for 5" drives).  This was the very first
Kaypro computer.  In Kaypro's defense, I have been told that they did later
reach an agreement with Ferguson and did pay him.  Unfortunately, Kaypro
went downhill from there and developed a knack for coming out with new
designs that were worse than their predecessors.  I have a Kaypro 286/16 AT
clone.  It is the only clone on which I have had trouble with standard
software.  Kaypro's recent bankruptcy was well-earned.  The old CP/M
machines were probably the best CP/M computers ever made in terms of
reliability, and many are still in regular use.

>> My hidden agenda is that someone is willing to sell me software for my

   The machines are very nearly identical.  This goes back quite a few
years, but my recollection is that I could almost always move software
between the BigBoard and the 820 without having to make any changes.  Of
course, you should understand that most software can moved between any CP/M
computers.  The only changes that are required are configuration for
different terminal codes and different port addresses for I/O.

   The Ferguson boards (including, I believe, the 820 and early Kaypros)
used memory-mapped video with BIOS support for terminal emulation.  Some
BigBoard software actually wrote directly to video RAM for better
performance.  As I recall, such software on my BigBoard would run on the
820.

   In short, I think that the BigBoard software will work, but you should
ask for the right to return it if it cannot be made to work.

Correct. The TS806-10 had a 10Mb drive. Actually, you'll have only 17MB

Mmmost is a program that runs on the 806, and takes care of the 800's disk I/O.
It also provides a rough form of protection, and some printer spooling.

It should boot from the HD. Press the reset button again immediately after
booting if it tries to boot from floppy.

I'm not sure. I had a 806/20, but it was scrapped when the HD gave out.

Subject: Transfer cp/m files to elsewhere
Message-ID: <BvDz5w.Ixp@sci.kun.nl>

Sketch of the situation: there's about 30 cp/m machines
'round here -- ICL Quadra, with one 5 1/4" floppy
(no idea 'bout density) and a 10M hard disk. The stuff
on the hard disk needs to be transferred to a UNIX system.

			----

But how? There's a COM port on these machines, so if
some kind soul can provide KERMIT or so, we could download
the contents to the UNIX system directly. An alternative
is to find a way of reading floppies from these ICLs on
an MS DOS machine (if I can find one with a 5 1/4" drive)
and I can deal with further transfers myself.

Would 22DISK work? I've seen this mentioned several times
here, I'm sure I can dredge up an XT to read the floppies
with. However, I need to get said 22DISK, and that's
easier said than done (really?)

Can someone point me to, say, a European cp/m users group,
an ftp site for a program to read cp/m floppies. How
'bout vaguely useful hints? Could use them, too.

If you need more tech information about these ICL machines,
mail me and I'll look it up. EMail to adridg@sci.kun.nl.

   I can't speak for freeware/shareware, but Al Hawley's ZMAC package, at
$50, is priced close to a shareware level and is an awfully good deal. 
Except for speed, where the SLR tools reign supreme, ZMAC is probably the
highest quality assembler/linker/librarian package available for CP/M.  It
has a number of features available only in the $195 professional SLR tools
(e.g., automatic grouping by the linker of data-segment items at the end of
all code-segment items) and some features found nowhere else (e.g.,
automatic RSX and type-4 Z-System program generation).  And Al Hawley
continues to make improvements.  All other CP/M assemblers are, as far as I
know, unsupported.

Subject: format for Digital Research CP/M 2.2 distribution disk?
Message-ID: <9209011441.AA16789@tmpcu.mdc.com>

I recently purchased the original Digital Research CP/M 2.2 that was mentioned
here earlier this summer.  The main reason I bought it was for the manual, but
the other members of the CP/M SIG and I would like to play around with the
distribution disk.  All the disk says is that it is in "Xerox" format.  Well,
one member's Xerox 820 wont read it and wont boot it.  Anyone out there know
what format to select in one of the format conversion programs (Uniform, 22disk,
etc,) to read this disk?

Thanks in advance for your help!

I have a Sony Model 35 Series 10 system the has 2 3.5" drives in it. I
am looking for some 
software to drive a modem that also can boot itself or I need a boot
disk also.

The machine currently only has some word processing software for it, but
I would like to
use it as a terminal. So, if anyone has or knows where I can get it (ftp
or otherwise), please
let me know. I also am looking for a cheap 2400 baud modem that will
work with this setup.

Thanks

I use both QTERM and kermit 4.11 on my kaypro II as terminal
programs. QTERM has a command to hang up the modem (^\,) which
doesn't seem to work. Has anybody been succesful in hanging up
the modem on a kaypro II? I was told that the problem is due to
an unusual wiring scheme in the machine. Thanks,

Did you try them?  I think 360K disks should work in a 720K drive.
Your mileage may vary.

I've used 360k floppies on my 720k drives and they work fine.
Unless you're using real old floppies that are barely qualified for
double sided, modern floppies are quite capable of the higher track
density.
I once calculated the bit densities for track-to-track and
bits along a track.  Even at double density, the density along
a track is significantly higher than track to track.
I've done quite well with the bulk floppies.
You should not be spending more than a quarter a piece.
(heck - I've bought 8" double sided floppies for a dime each,
and I've recently been getting them for free).

	Both carry 3M 747-0RH, which is a 5.25" quad density diskette
	for about $20-$24 per box of 10.

Under DOS I could format standard 360K 5-1/4" disks to 720K with a programm
called FDFORMAT.

Hello out there in networld! I have just aquired an NCR DecisionMate V
computer, and need some help with it:

Although I have boot disks and CP/M manuals for it, I have no users
manual for the actual machine itself. I will send what it costs to copy
your manual if you have such a machine...

Second dilemma: the machine came with no I/O ports, I believe these are
plug-in modules for RS-232 and Centronics Parallel. Does anyone have any
spares of these, or know where I can obtain them? Alternatley, if you
can send me a schematic for them, I can produce my own. (Pre-fab'd parts
preffered though.)

There is also a curious DB-9 male connector on the right-hand side of
the keyboard... can anyone tell me what it is used for?

Much Thanks in advance for anyone who can help!

BTW, I am also looking for a good communications package for the NCR
too!

Subject: The easiest way to convert formats
Message-ID: <9209020357.aa29394@WHARF.BRL.MIL>

Hello.

May I suggest that the easiest way to convert formats (I do it quite
often) is to execute the job on one of those PC's which are anyway
idle anywhere.  There is a program at the Simtel PC archive and its
replica named 22DSK that does it splendidly. It reads/write just about
any format from ready made tables, and if you have one very strange
format you can expand the table for your case. It won't work with hard
sectored diskettes nor with diskettes written with the Motorola
controller chip found on the old timer Commodore C-64 or Apples.

I also have the Media Master package on CP/M, which costed me some
money, but I never use it, as it is so more convenient to transit on
a PC with 22DSK.

May I add to the veritable flurry of CP/M systems being offered for
sale??  I have had no mechanical/electronic problems (or, for that
matter, modifications) with the Osborne 1 (SS/SD) I bought about ten
years ago.  Used it for relatively lightweight word processing, and,
more recently--very lightly as a terminal to the local "BIG" computer.

I don't have any idea as to the market value (but wondered if the
Boston Computer Exchange even "lists" Osbornes any more?....), so will
be glad to hear from Osborne enthusiasts who may need a working machine
for spare parts, as a backup machine, or whatever with offers to
purchase!!  [Please, I'd feel badly accepting anything over $10,000 :-) ]

More details:
      Grey case Osborne 1, 64K, two floppy drives
      All original copies of software which was included:
            Wordstar (v.2.26?)
            dBase II (never used!!) complete with _two_ manuals
                and a keyboard template
            SuperCalc
      Blue-cover paperback user's manual Osborne
      Townsend, Carl, _Using dBase II_, Osborne-McGraw-Hill, 1984
      Miller, Alan R, Mastering CP/M, Sybex, 1983
      IMP (communications) software "ready to go" with cable included
      2 dozen or so floppy diskettes

      whatever else I can find that will fit into the original box and
packing material.  If you're not interested in buying this package, but
have an opinion as to its value, I'd be glad to get a brief message, but
it's too late to convince **ME** as to the relative merits of CP/M over
DOS.  I just don't have the time to dig into the guts to get CP/M to do
what I want it to--more or less on my own.

      Please respond directly--there's no need to clutter up INFO-CPM
with responses (this is too long already!)

Subject: ASCII transfers cpm-80 to Macintosh os
Message-ID: <1992Sep3.190449.19115@dartvax.dartmouth.edu>

I have an old Epson Geneva PX-8 laptop that I use as a notebook for
wordprocessing.  Does anyone know of software set-up that will allow me
to transfer files (ASCII in Portable WordStar) to the Macintosh?  I
know it exists because I used to do it regularly four years ago. 
Unfortunately, the software dreamed up by a developer here no longer
works for me, I suspect because my operating system on the Macintosh is
too new.  I've tried all the old o.s.'s I could get hold of and nothing
works.  Currently I use Macintosh system 6.0.8 on Mac Plus, SE-30, and
LC.  Grateful for *any* help.

Can't you just use standard 1.2MB floppies on a 720k drive?
It seems since the media is the same, it should work.

 Sorry, the media are distinctly NOT the same!  It is unlikely that the
 720 drive could even successfully format the disk - much less write data 
 to it.  The 1.2 floppy requires a much higher magnetic force to write 
 to it.

If it were, you could. But it isn't.

1.2MB floppies are High Density.  720K floppies are Quad Density.  360K
floppies are Double Density.  Now it turns out that the media currently
used in 360K floppies copes with 720K format (more tracks, no higher bit
density in the track) better than 1.2M floppies (which expect a higher
bit density in the track).

I've had better results with 360K floppies than I've had with 1.2MB
ones, and they're cheaper too :-)

I suggest that if you still have your CPM machine up and running, why not use a communication program to do the transfer.  More than likely it will be easiler than getting another piece of software and it should be fairly quick. Many CPM boxes will allow you to run the comm port a 9600 or 19200 (of course KAYPROs are the exception). I've used this approach for years and I've been very successful at it.  Rarely have I not been able to move files from one machine to another. Now if your CPM box nolonger work







s, than try the software approach but if you want something quick and dirty use a communication program.

Does anyonew know of a CP/M make utility for use with Makefiles?  And if
not, I guess I should port one or something.  I would imagine that it could
use the Archive Bit of the filename to keep track of what modules are
current.

BTW, I have Aztec Manx C, which is quite good for K&R, but it just doesn't
include a make utility.

Not quite. There *IS* a difference in media between IBM 1.2 meg
disks and IBM 360K disks / Quad density 720K disks. If you don't
believe me, try taking a 360K disk, and formatting it to 1.2 megs.
OTOH, as has been noted you can format 360K disks to 720K (or even
800K) in an IBM 1.2 meg drive: I have a couple of utilities to do
this, and use the 800K format for all my archival backups. It
provides by far and away the best cost per megabyte: 25 cents for
800K works out to about 32 cents per megabyte.

Apparently some of these 'quad' density disk drives are sensitive about NOT 
having hub rings on the floppy. You will notice that High-Density floppies
do not have these rings...

So, is there a source of fairly high quality DS/DD floppies WITHOUT hub rings,
for those of us that plan to format and use these disks as if they were Quad
density disks?

I use both a 4/84 and a 4+88 to work with the internet.  The obstacle you
will encounter is that your host machine may not have software that works
gracefully with the Kaypro.  Some editors presume function keys; some
host software does the same.  The problem lies not in the Kaypro but in
your host mainframe.

If your systems people cannot help you out with an editor and/or support
for the ADM-3A that the Kaypro emulates, perhaps you can find a keypad
redefinition program (several were available for the Kaypro at one time)
that will allow you to program the function key codes into the numeric
keypad.  I'm not sure if it is possible, but it is certainly worth a try
if your host system won't support the Kaypro.  Good luck.

I've written Yet Another CP/M disk conversion for the PC which I think is
pretty keen.  It installs as a device driver instead of being run as a
standalone program so you can manipulate files right off your CP/M floppy
instead of copying them to an MS-DOS disk first.  The drive letter it gives
you can be accessed like any MS-DOS drive, but reading your CP/M disk.  
This would be especially handy when you're running a CP/M emulator like Z80MU
or looking at dBase files.  It is limited to reading only.

I'm finishing up the documentation now, so I'll have a beta test version
ready Real Soon Now.  If you're interested in beta testing this program
(called CP/M Reader), let me know and I'll send you a copy when it's ready.
It currently has about 40 or 50 different disk formats built-in, so it 
should work on just about any 512 byte per sector MFM format disk.  I only
have my own computer to test it on, so I can only say that Superbrain disks
work like a charm (except for my disk alignment problem, grrr).

I'll post a notice here when it's out of beta test.

Hub rings have nothing to do with the density, capacity, etc.

The reason hub rings are not needed on the high-density drives, is that
the drive spins on inserting the disk.  The hub motion is
self-centering because of the rotation.

The older designed drives, the full-height ones, used varying tapers on
the clamping cones.   These drives did NOT rotate upon insertion, and
the hub rings were the added re-inforcment to keep the center holes of
the disks from crimping.

You could really crunch the older disks too, as the drive was done via
a belt and you could really get some torque going in comparison to the
direct drive units.

I had disks (in the 1979/80) era that would spin in the full height
drives, but would not in the half-height direct drive units.

     Sure, Bill, except that you made an implicit assumption which in my
case does not work: my Z80 CP/M Lobo is my HOME workhorse, while there is
a PC on my OFFICE desk. To follow your recommendation I would need to leave
the PC powered up at all times, to inflige a modem to any person calling me
when I am out of office, to deny phone calls to my family, and to work much
slower than you say with the old 1200 bauds modems which I own. Instead, when
I need a copy here and there, 22DSK on the PC does it instantly!
By the way in the CP/M archives at SIMTEL20 (not MSDOS, CP/M), there IS a
program that works very well on my Lobo to read/write in PC-compatible
format, I just forgot its name.

Mix Software, 2116 E. Arapahoe, Suite 365, Richardson, TX, 75081, used to
market a C compiler for CP/M.  I still use my copy for CP/M programming
and use Turbo C for the DOS environment.  Only minor compatibility
problems, and they usually arise when I want do use some of the extensions
that Turbo C makes available.  The Mix C documentation has been worth the
price of the compiler.  When I bought it the Mix C compiler was selling
for under $30, and if it is still sold it should be worth the price.

I hope you have received a number of replies by email, nothing has 
passed this way in this newsgroup.  

If Modula-2 is acceptable, there is a compiler package from Workman & 
Associates - since FTL was written in Queensland Oz, you might already 
know of this and have a more convenient source.  The CP/M version was a 
very reasonable price and there is a version for MSDOS and TOS.

For the language 'C', don't know of a really good public domain compiler 
package. BDS C isn't PD but is interesting ...

There have been about four different versions of 'make' ported to 
CP/M.  The source for one, in Manx Aztec C was written up in a 
back issue of 'Doctor Dobb's Journal'.  Perhaps you might check 
the Periodical Index to find the right volume of DDJ, UofWaterloo 
has/had a fairly complete set of that magazine.  If they've done 
a housecleaning in the last decade, leave a message here with the 
volume number needed.
Good luck.

There is a shareware utility called Chameleon that can move both text and
binary files between DOS 3.3, Prodos 8, CP/M, and Apple Pascal.  Works great!
If you are using a super serial board and find a CP/M executable that talks
to it, I would like to know.  I have MEX and the SSB overlay, but have never
gotten around to trying to get it working.

That first one sounds like a machine I am currently trying to repair.

Does anyone have any technical information about the Altos 586?

My immediate problem is with the floppy drive.  I bought a replacement
floppy drive for the one that died while I was trying to replace the
crashed hard disc... 

The good news is, it is possible to boot up from the new floppy. 

The bad news is, the system will only read from the floppy if the drive is 
already spinning when the read attempt is made.  Eg, the first boot attempt 
fails, but the second works, as long as the second attempt starts while the 
floppy is still spinning from the previous attempt. 

The question: Is there some way I can wire up the floppy drive so that the 
motor is always spinning as long as the power is on?  (I realise this is a 
horrible solution, but it's the easiest I can think of) 

Or is there some sort of Drive Ready signal that I can fake somehow? Would 
any of the jumpers on the drive have anything do with it? 

The drive is 5.25" quad density made by Mitsubishi and it has jumpers on it
labelled MX, HS, HM.  There is a jumper in the HS position.


(I have cross-posted fairly widely, and redirected followups to comp.periphs
and comp.unix.xenix.misc, as this hardly qualifies as a folklore question)

Replies by email would be appreciated, as the system I am posting from
expires articles *very* quickly and I could easily miss something important.

Just to be nit-picky  :-)  720K 5-1/4" drives/disks are NOT quad density,
though they are sometimes incorrectly called that!!  The drives/disks are
DOUBLE DENSITY, but have twice as many TRACKS as a standard Double Density
drive/disk.

Check out C/80 by Software Toolworks, Sherman Oaks, CA.
As I recall, it had a "make" utility.

It went with their product C/NIX, a Unix-like shell for CP/M machines.
I played with it for a while, and it's great!
(It does for CP/M what MKS Toolkit does for DOS).

Sorry, no idea about current availability, etc.

Cheers,
Andy

I've got a copy of C/80 with the mathpack
for $30.00, I'll pay shipping in the US.
It works great, but we went to Archimedes tools at work.  I used
it on  a pc with z80mu.  A great combination.  You can single step
the code and debug without an ice.

Have you tried reading that diskette with 22DSK138's 5 different Xerox

In your place this is certainly how I would begin.

I think some of the Xerox 820 formats use a track 0 which is
single density. A standard PC floppy controller probably won't
read a single density track, since that pin on the controller is
not connected to anything. On the 22DISK DOCUMENTATION near the
back, it's explained how to modify a card to read single density.
With this modification, I've been able to read single density Osborne
and Heathkit diskettes.

Hmm,  So let's get this straight.  They are double track and double
density.  2 * 2 = 4.  4 times the density is NOT QUAD density.  Got it.

To pick a nit ....

The org CP/M disks I had were 10 hole hard sectors with 100K per side on
a single sided disk, basically DS/QD is 7+ times that.  The issue at
hand is DENSITY however.  Density meaning how tight the bits are packed. 
Tightly packing the sectors and increasing their size to 512 bytes
enabled us to get 180K on the side of a disk rather than the old 100K
functionality.  This basically put the "bits" almost twice as close
together on a given track, hence "double" density.  Doubling the number
of tracks brings the bits another factor of 2 closer together hence the
term "QUAD DENSITY" diskettes.  QD diskettes were marketed extensively
pre-ibm and clone takeover for hardware such as EPSON, OLIVETTI, SEIKO
(Yea The watch guys sold computers!) and my Heathkit.  The AT&T 3B2 used
these puppies too.  Now the quality of standard IBM "Double Density"
360K media is so good it will work fine as 720K "Quad Density" too. 

The Current Crop of AT/HD stuff is even higher than quad, packing 15 512
byte sectors on a track instead of 9 a factor of 1.7 improvement in
density.  The 3.5" disks on the other hand STARTED at 720K which was
called "double density" so the 1440K 18 SPT 3.5's are now often called
"quad density" which is where the confusion may be from. 

The REAL density improvement on 5.25" has not "really" doubled though.

Single Density = 100K per side
Double Density = 180K per side really 1.8 density not 2
Quad Density   = 360K per side really 3.6 density but advertising you know. 
High Density   = 600K per side They didn't push to "HEPT" density on
		 this one :)

Again this is BIT density, nothing to do with actual storage mind you. 
Also the 3.5's really started out on the HD emulsions.  Now the NEW
stuff comming out is pushing 10MB on Standard floppy style media.  They
stopped "densitizing" the names (finally, thank god) and just say
"2.4MB" or "5MB" 5-1/4" media.

With a copy of AnaDisk you should be able to determine whether it is readable
on a PC, and the characteristics of the format - sector size, interleave, 
sector numbering, etc.

With that information, you should be able to 'build' a custom format identity
for 22Disk, and thus read the disk.

An alternative is to send the disk to Sydex, along with the 22Disk registration
fee, and they will 'build' the format identity for you.

I do not have the direct answer.  However, I have something which may be of
help to you, or be useful for general info:
In the appendix for Kenneth Heyda's "MULTI-SYSTEM 180 with ZCPR2.3"
there is a list of system format parameters for about 20 manufacturers.
I will copy it to here if desired.

E.g., XEROX 820 SD has 18 sectors/track, 128 bytes/sector, and is 
(of course?) S (=single density).
XEROX 820-II DD    has 17,               256,  and (of course?) D.
There is no other Xerox listing.

Hello all:

Does anyone know of a CPM emulator so I can run CPM80 on platforms
that are not of the 8080 family.

I know of one for 8086 machine running DOS but am looking for one that runs
either on Macintosh computers or Unix boxes.

Why? Because I have some CPM software that I run now and again but my

etc etc).

Any help would be appreciated.
thanks

With the exception of the Xerox 16/8 DEM, all Xerox floppy formats have track 0
formatted as single density.  While I fight with 22DISK to get it to work with
the Xerox formats, I HAVE gotten it to work.  Of course, it does not work for
Xerox 820 disks, since they are single density, and the controller in the PC
can't handle that (without modifications).

I may be way out in left field here, but if I remember right, the first couple
of tracks are reserved for the boot sectors, and there should be nothing for
22DISK to read there anyway.

I have a Sony Series 35 Model 10 System that I would REALLY like to get rid of.

The specs as I know are:

	Mac SE look-like case
	2 - 3.5" drives
	Parallel and Serial Ports
	Word Processing Software Package
	Wide Carriage 40cps daisywheel
	     with Twin-bin sheet feeeder
	     and approx 40 extra ribbons.

	From what I have learned this is  a CP/M system

Would like to get $300 for this, but will CERTAINLY entertain ANY offers.

Thanks

Subject: KAYPRO W/ WORDSTAR
Message-ID: <1992Sep14.163014.1@vax1.umkc.edu>

I'm writing this on behalf of some friends.  What could be causing Wordstar on
a Kaypro to loose all digits and punctuation on the monitor after about five
minutes of operation?  The characters exist in the text file and print fine but
do not display on the CRT.  After about five minutes of operation these
characters are lost but the editing session can still continue with everything
behaving normally except for the display.  The digits and punctuation
characters disappear and are replaced by blank spaces on the CRT.  I'm sorry I
don't know more specifics on the machine and version of Wordstar being used,
but it was purchased, in the US, in the early 80's.  This machine has served
them very well in Spain, and now in the US.

I use Wordstar and CPM on my Apple ][+ and still like it very well.

They'd have to be less than twice the cost of the cheapest 360K
disk you can find to be effective. And that doesn't include the
cost of the hole puncher needed to run 720K 3.5" disks at 1.44 meg
densities.

Believe it or not, I've seen DSHD diskettes WITH hub rings.  In
fact, I have a few in my collection.

I guess a reason that HD diskettes have no hub ring is so then
the dumb-ass user can tell the difference between a "360K" disk
and a "1.2M" disk just by looking at it.

I've seen DSDD diskettes without hub rings, but those are a PAIN
to find.  I wouldn't waste my time worrying about those silly hub
rings.  Just get DSDD diskettes and get it the hell over with...

	No, it really is a Kaypro 1.  The Kaypro 1 was introduced
around 1985 or so.  It came after all of the Kaypro 2's.  A brief
description of what is has is: 64K, 2 Ds/DD disk drives, 2 serial, 1
parallel, came with CP/M and Perfect Writer.  It has what was called
the "Universal Roms", which was when Kaypro finally got around to
standardizing the roms in all of the machines.

	I have one of them sitting downstairs, along with an original
II'83 and all of the documentation if that can help.  I've also
cross-posted this to comp.os.cpm (which is why I left in so much of
the article.  Apologies to those who get concerned about that sort of
thing.)

I am looking for information about some Kaypro computer's

capacity drives which were manufactured in the 84-85 timeframe.

I believe these machines were called Robie machines or some
such.  I cannot boot normal 360k floppies on these machines,
although the Drivtecs I haved used on PC's will do so.

It sounds like the character generator EPROM is flakey and some of
the bits are failing.
There was a discussion on this in sci.electronics not so long back.

Try removing the EPROM and cleaning the pins if it is socketed, otherwise
resolder the pins.

good luck

There were two Kaypro manifestations of the Drivetec 3.3 floppy disk drive.
One was the Robie (Darth Vader's lunchbox), and the other was the 4X which
was the normal Kaypro box but with Drivetec's vice normal 360's.

Either version was capable of reading a 360k disk, *but*, only after booting
from the 3.3 disk.  Neither version was capable of writing to a 360k disk.

Message-ID: <ins279k.717045543@mdw039.cc.monash.edu.au>

Hi!

My Father, not being computer minded, paid too much for a Xerox cpm machine
at an auction not so long ago.

It came with NO disks, NO documentation and NO refund......
Consequently, he wants me to get it running for him so that he can do some
basic word processing, spread sheet and database work. (Nothing fancy, but
enough to keep track of bills etc. in his small business)

I know absolutely NOTHING about cpm and have only subscribed to this news
group to find out if the machine can still be used....

It is a Xerox machine (as already stated) with two 8" floppy drives, and a
pretty standard looking CRT. The machine has no visible model name or 
identifyable markings other than "XEROX" on it's crt case. The machine
displays the following message when it is first turned on...

	 XEROX 820 RX VER 1.0...
	 L - LOAD SYSTEM 

It has a printer port, comm port and the keyboard and disk drives also have
port connections going into the crt box where the cpu obviously lives.
I opened the crt box to see if there were any easily identifyable chips or
interesting helpful "other things" but not much made sense to me (what did
I expect?)

Does anyone know what sort of software runs on this dinosaur, & where I could
get it etc??? What disk format does it use?? Any information (useful or
otherwise) would be greatly appreciated!!!

Please e-mail me or post replies here...

Thanks.....martin  (ins279k@ccds.cc.monash.edu.au)

ps: sorry if this is a FAQ....

I long ago got rid of the best computer I ever owned , a rock solid Kaypro II.
I'm still getting by on stone-age stuff: a couple of 8088 XT clones. I have
just inherited another KII from a friend's closet which seems to be
suffering from failure to communicate with its A drive. Switch on, warms up,
CRT says put disk in drive. There is only the master disk, which I ASSUME is
not damaged, but the drive doesn't pay it any mind, or perhaps the board
doesn't pay the drive any mind. I opened up the case, admired the clean lines
of the interior, and swapped the drives, on the theory that A is broke and 
maybe B ain't. No response. Next move?

Subject: Mysterious Televideo computer
Message-ID: <1992Sep21.052835.2679@athena.cs.uga.edu>

I have come into possession of a device made by Televideo, and would
appreciate any information anyone could supply.

I have found no model number on this computer, so I can only report that it 
is a self-contained unit, with a monitor mounted on vertical pivots.  Stacked 
to the right of the monitor are two 5.25" vertical disk drives.  The keyboard,
which attaches to the system unit with a coiled cable and modular telephone
connector, has a label that says "Tele-PC", and is laid out much like
the keyboards on the early IBM PC.

Of course, no disks or documentation came with this thing.  I'm guessing
it's a CP/M machine, but does anyone recognize it from the description?

	Did you also remember to swap the terminating resistor?  Also
have you tried cleaning the drives?  Also try it with just one drive

When you swapped the drives, did you change the drive select jumpers?  Does
either one of the drive LEDs come on?

   Probably not.  Z80MU does not implement a complete and accurate CP/M
system.  It does a good enough job to allow one to run most standard CP/M
application programs, but it cannot handle operating-system-level stuff.

   However, there is an extremely nice program by Simeon Cran of
Australia called MYZ80.  It creates a totally complete CP/M environment,
including the file system, and it runs anything that will run under CP/M. 
It took me less than a minute to have an NZCOM version of Z-System
running under it.  Look for the file MYZ80100.ZIP on BBSs and (I hope) on
SIMTEL20.  My 486 PC is now by far my highest performance Z-System
Z80/Z180 computer

Subject: Help with Televideo TS816
Message-ID: <1992Sep22.000833.20452@spatula.rent.com>

Hiyas all. For some time now, Ive had a TS816 that I didnt do much
with, so it sat around idle for about a year. Now the other day when
I went to power it on, it wouldnt boot. The belt slipped of the hard
drive, and when I put it back on, I fear that I spun the drive motor
in reverse. For those not familiar with Quantum 8" drives, this can be
A Very Bad Thing. (apperently what happens is the head is mounted on 
a sort of diagional, and when spun backwards, it gouges the platters)

So now I am in sort of a situation. When I first aquired the machine, I
used the tape drive to dump all the data onto carts, so I have a backup
of all the stuff. But, I cant boot it. The head arm goes into its 
jumping back and forth fits, and never arrives at the boot track. 
But, hopefully all is not lost. I have a spare Quantum Q2040 laying 
about (same size drive), that I can replace it with, but the problem is
getting a boot onto it. I know that the 816 can boot from a tape, but 
I dont have a bootable tape. Is there someone out there who could create
one for me, with the dump program on it (and directions, its been a long
time and I dont recall the command syntax) so I can restore it? I would
reimburse you with a replacement tape, and/or shipping, as you desire

Thanx!

In your situation I'd check out your boot disk.  You can do this on any MS-
DOS machine using one of several programs which will read and write the
Kaypro II SSDD format.  One such, which I have on my BBS (512-259-1261, the
Kaypro Club of Austin (TX)) is 22DISK, a shareware set of programs which
allow reading and writing of files to and from floppies using various CP/M
formats.  Another offering from the same company (Sydex) is ANADISK, also for
MS-DOS machines, which will check your boot disk for dead sectors.  Our BBS
offers assistance for Kaypro CP/M users, in as much as we can over the
distances involved.

Hi!!!

I've been told that the Xerox 820 cpm machine with SSSD 8" drives, is just
a Ferguson Big Board "in disguise". Is this true?? What's a Ferguson Big
Board??? 

My hidden agenda is that someone is willing to sell me software for my Xerox
820 which runs on his Ferguson Big Board machine. The claim is that the two
machines are identical.

Any help would be greatly appreciated.....

	Nope, it's not on SIMTEL20 yet, at least under PD1:<MSDOS.

Yes.  Much less.  From memory the price is AUS$30 (works out to about
US$25 I think).

I've had a brief play with MYZ80 and was very impressed.  The pop-up
"debug" window is very useful (ctrl-break brings up a window which
allows single stepping, etc).

I brought it up, in the default configuration, out of the box.  By
default it runs ZPM3 (a CP/M Plus clone) and works very well.  Utilities
are provided for importing/exporting from the CP/M drive, and there is
an API around for talking to the host machines hardware (eg, for serial
comms, printer, etc).

I would strongly recommend obtaining a copy and having a look at it if
you are at all interested in Z80 and/or CP/M emulation. Oh, BTW, it's a
true emulator - with a real BIOS, BDOS, and CCP - none of this "emulated
BDOS" mess.

Simeon Cran, the author, has done a very good job with both MyZ80 and
ZP/M 3.  I use ZP/M 3 on my main CP/M machine, and it works nicely and
is a bit faster than the generic CP/M Plus.  MyZ80 is also very fast.  I
got the impression that on my 286/10 it was an effective 2.5 Mhz Z80 -
very very good.

Subject: Televideo TS806/20 Info Requested
Message-ID: <jfoy.717670030@glia>

Today I was given a system that is tagged as TS-806/20. I'm assuming, at 
least for the moment, that it is a TS-806 computer with a 20 meg hard 
drive. (I know there's a hard drive but I've not been able to determine 
what kind it is yet)

The system came with five TeleVideo 925 terminals with keyboards.

According to what little info came with the system, it seems to run a 
network-type system called MmmOST with CP/M R 2.2.

Ok, the problems:

 1) No boot disk. (5.25" floppy drive so assuming this should be a 5.25" 
    floppy diskette -- about 368k I'd imagine.

 2) No cable for the hard drive. Two openings on the rear of the machine 
    are labeled WINCH (DATA)  and  WINCH (CONTROL). I'm assuming this is 
    where the cable is supposed to snake through.

 3) The cables for the workstation terminals had been severed so I'll 
    probably need new ones. They seem to be RS-422 D-style connections 
    (15-pins).

The questions:

 1) Where can I get a boot disk either with or without MmmOST? Cost?

 2) Where can I get an appropriate hard drive cable? Cost?

 3) Will any RS-422 cables work? If not, where can I get the right type 
    for this setup?


The sooner I can get this system online, the sooner I can finish up CP/M 
ZIP as my other CP/M system (BMC if800) bit the big one about three 
weeks ago.

Comments, pointers, tips, etc. are definitely encouraged.

Thanks for your attention. :)

Subject: Urgent - Info about communications abilities of a CPC6128
Message-ID: <9209251054.aa08910@WHARF.BRL.MIL>

Hello,

I have an Amstrad CPC 6128 computer, running CP/M plus. I want to access
my computer account in the university so since I already have this computer
I was wondering if I could use it as a remote terminal.

So:

1) I know there is a 'general expansion slot' where I could connect an
   RS 232 port. So i can connect it to a modem. But, someone told me that
   regular modems arent 'proper' for Amstrad. I know it sounds silly, because
   the RS232 port is a standard and modems just 'talk' to it, but before
   I give all those money for a modem, I wanna be 100% sure that it will work.
   So, will I have any H/W problems or I will just need regular modem?

2) S/W question:  What communications program will I need in order to
   establish the connection? I am wondering if there is something similar
   to the PROCOMM thing. Does anyone know any program that could turn
   my CPC6128 to a network terminal?   Can I find anything in some anonymous
   FTP site?    if not, is there anything in the market? does it provide
   vt100 emulation?

Please, if anyone wishes to answer I would appreciate if it will be
sent to me by private e-mail because I am not reading the mails of this
discussion group.

Thanks in advance

Hello everyone,
    I have two Victor 9000 computers from the early '80s, and was wondering
if anyone knew anything about them.  They run cpm/86 or ms-dos 2.1.
It appears that they are running an intel 8088 processor like the IBM pc,
but they don't seem to be fully IBM compatible.  I do know that the cpm
system works right.  But anyway, the question is, does anyone know anything
about these machines, have any software they will run, or any peripherals
with which they are compatible?  Also any idea on approximate value if I
were to try to sell these things?

Thanks

I think that the 'Winch' slots you mention are probably for an external 
drive.  There should be an internal one.  Also, on the back panel should
be a 25 pin connector marked Terminal.  On the machine that I have seen, 
this was for the 'master' terminal - the others were for 'slave' or 
'satellite' terminals.

I have a couple of disks with the MmmOST files on them, but neither are 
bootable.  I'd be very interested in a copy of a CP/M 2.2 system disk if
you get one, and also a bootable TurboDOS floppy if someone runs across
one.

The victor 9000 is an MS-DOS compatible, definately NOT IBM-PC
compatible. I knew someone who had one running. It can redefine
ALL it's character fonts, and this option is used in the
special basic to 'do' graphics (i.e. the value in the screen
memory indexes a (i believe 16x16 or 8x16 dot) bitmap array.)

I think it'll run a fair share of MS-DOS programs, but IBM-BIOS
compatibility is a problem...

Ed, is WordStar talking directly to the printer or is it going through
the BIOS (or BDOS)? I remember having this same problem when I was
using 4.0 on CP/M. Removing all the other drivers (ASCII, DRAFT, blah,
blah) helped me.

   It is basically true.  Jim Ferguson developed a very nice single-board
Z80 computer kit at a very attractive price.  That was my first computer,
and it was very nicely done.

   Two other computers used the basic Ferguson design: Xerox and Kaypro.  As
I understand it, Xerox did the right thing legally and ethically; they paid
Ferguson to design a similar board to serve as the basis for their personal
computer.  But they did the wrong thing technically.  They insisted on some
changes from the BigBoard design; all, as far as I could tell (I also had a
Xerox 820 for a while), made the computer worse!

   Kaypro, on the other hand, apparently stole the BigBoard concept. 
However, they did the right thing technically, introducing some nice
improvements (such as support for 5" drives).  This was the very first
Kaypro computer.  In Kaypro's defense, I have been told that they did later
reach an agreement with Ferguson and did pay him.  Unfortunately, Kaypro
went downhill from there and developed a knack for coming out with new
designs that were worse than their predecessors.  I have a Kaypro 286/16 AT
clone.  It is the only clone on which I have had trouble with standard
software.  Kaypro's recent bankruptcy was well-earned.  The old CP/M
machines were probably the best CP/M computers ever made in terms of
reliability, and many are still in regular use.

>> My hidden agenda is that someone is willing to sell me software for my

   The machines are very nearly identical.  This goes back quite a few
years, but my recollection is that I could almost always move software
between the BigBoard and the 820 without having to make any changes.  Of
course, you should understand that most software can moved between any CP/M
computers.  The only changes that are required are configuration for
different terminal codes and different port addresses for I/O.

   The Ferguson boards (including, I believe, the 820 and early Kaypros)
used memory-mapped video with BIOS support for terminal emulation.  Some
BigBoard software actually wrote directly to video RAM for better
performance.  As I recall, such software on my BigBoard would run on the
820.

   In short, I think that the BigBoard software will work, but you should
ask for the right to return it if it cannot be made to work.

Correct. The TS806-10 had a 10Mb drive. Actually, you'll have only 17MB
to use. :-(

Thos should be TS800-A's, which are full Z80 systems, but without disks.

Mmmost is a program that runs on the 806, and takes care of the 800's disk I/O.
It also provides a rough form of protection, and some printer spooling.

It should boot from the HD. Press the reset button again immediately after
booting if it tries to boot from floppy.

Subject: Transfer cp/m files to elsewhere
Message-ID: <BvDz5w.Ixp@sci.kun.nl>

Sketch of the situation: there's about 30 cp/m machines
'round here -- ICL Quadra, with one 5 1/4" floppy
(no idea 'bout density) and a 10M hard disk. The stuff
on the hard disk needs to be transferred to a UNIX system.

			----

But how? There's a COM port on these machines, so if
some kind soul can provide KERMIT or so, we could download
the contents to the UNIX system directly. An alternative
is to find a way of reading floppies from these ICLs on
an MS DOS machine (if I can find one with a 5 1/4" drive)
and I can deal with further transfers myself.

Would 22DISK work? I've seen this mentioned several times
here, I'm sure I can dredge up an XT to read the floppies
with. However, I need to get said 22DISK, and that's
easier said than done (really?)

Can someone point me to, say, a European cp/m users group,
an ftp site for a program to read cp/m floppies. How
'bout vaguely useful hints? Could use them, too.

If you need more tech information about these ICL machines,
mail me and I'll look it up. EMail to adridg@sci.kun.nl.

   I can't speak for freeware/shareware, but Al Hawley's ZMAC package, at
$50, is priced close to a shareware level and is an awfully good deal. 
Except for speed, where the SLR tools reign supreme, ZMAC is probably the
highest quality assembler/linker/librarian package available for CP/M.  It
has a number of features available only in the $195 professional SLR tools
(e.g., automatic grouping by the linker of data-segment items at the end of
all code-segment items) and some features found nowhere else (e.g.,
automatic RSX and type-4 Z-System program generation).  And Al Hawley
continues to make improvements.  All other CP/M assemblers are, as far as I
know, unsupported.
