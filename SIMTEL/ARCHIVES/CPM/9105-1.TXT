Subject: C compilers
Message-ID: <mds.673090403@iddth2>

Every once in a while people ask for C-compilers. 

I got the Hi-Tech C in England and I like it :-). The Hi-Tech C was
used for the excellent program zmp; one of the reasons why I chose that
compiler among others. One of the main features of Hi-Tech is that it
is ANSI compatible, so most of the programs written today should
compile with little or no modification. All hackers will appreciate
that all library modules are supplied in source code. Well, nobody
is perfect and the Hi-Tech C has some rough edges but I have been able
to work my way around them with no problems at all. I can post what I
have found out if people are interested. As for the price; it is not
cheap, 120 britsh pounds or 200++ $ (?), but I think it is worth the
money.

And now the most important thing; where to get it:

	GREY MATTER
	2 Prigg Meadow
	Ashburton
	Devon TQ 13 7DF
	England

	Tel. (0364) 53499

As a final remark I want to point out that I have no personal interest
in GREY MATTER, so this is nothing but a friedly hint to fellow CP/M
users.

I hope adverts are allowed in here...

CRR is the CP/M offline reader for use with bulletin boards which 
run XRSDoor (RAX, QMX, etc.)

It runs on any Z80 CPM 2.2 (or later) system with 42K TPA.

If you are interested, please ask for the file "CRR0110.ZIP" on 
your local Fidonet board. (They can get it from the same place 
they got XRS and XRSDoor.)

Subject: Rainbow to 386 file transfer.

Wow !

1-Your Rainbow, as you say yourself, runs MSDOS 2.05 (and there are more recent
versions which you do not need for this purpose) and is perfectly able to read
and write 5.25 in diskettes formatted on your 386 machine provided you format
them SINGLE SIDED, 40 or 80 tracks, on the 386 (specially if 40 tracks).
                                    ==========
2-Even if you insist running the Rainbow under CP/M-86 only, you still can
read and write IBM-PC formatted diskettes, one-sided only of course, using
the MediaMaster commercial program on either the Rainbow or 386, or the
22DISK utility found on SIMTEL-20/MSDOS and replica servers. The latter
however will only work on your 386 and only if your 386 has an 80 tracks
5.25in diskette drive.

3-A third solution is to use Kermit to move files around. At 19200 bauds the
transfer of what you can type in does not add much time to the typing job!

4-The VT102 supersedes VT100 emulation. In fact we use Rainbows here as
VT100, VT102, VT220, without the slightest difficulty. Watch the setup menu!
If you experienced a problem, make sure that the emulation is set TO ANSI, and
if your communication insists on other than NONE parity (some IBM controllers
do), use 7 bits character coding. You have full VT220 compatibility, except,
I think, that you cannot program 80/132 col. mode from the host but must do it
manually.

5-Contrarily to what too many people believe, the Rainbow efficiently runs
almost ANY MSDOS software, except games and closed packages developped for
maximal display speed bypassing DOS calls, and of course any graphics based
application. It may be difficult to reach that configuration today, but I hold
in my lab a Rainbow with 768k memory (not 640...) and a 20 Mb hard disk, and
won't give it out so quickly. The JOVE editor is more than you need for any
editing job, thus I use it on the Rainbow and other PC's. Any serious compiler
works just the same (I use FORTRAN a lot). TeX runs smoothly with an excellent
Previewer. Clearly, Supermarket software fails, but for real scientific work
it ain't a bad machine at all, even in 1991. The problem is, if yours is bare
with 2 diskettes and 256k only, then of course you must forget about TeX and
such things that need more RAM and/or lots of disk space.

If you are looking for a program to make your DOS drive emulate just 
about any CPM drive, try 22DISK from Sydex.  As shareware, it can fake 
more than 200 CPM disk formats.  If you register (or buy direct) for 
only $15, they will custom write a parameter file for your drive if 
one is not included already.

My CPM disk is for an Epson 3.5" laptop that is about as non-standard 
as a disk gets.  The folks at Sydex made it possible for me to pop a 
floppy in my PC and read, write, and even format my Epson disks!

I can't rate the product highly enough - or the people.

I have some Kaypro II boot disks and system software.  I don't think that 
they will work but I could make copies of them for you or other Kaypro users 
out there.

I might have some Osborne 1 boot disks laying around somewhere.  The question 
is where.  Send me a note in a few days and I will have hopefully found them.

I've been doing some assembly language programming on my Northstar
advantage, and the CP/M 2.0 assembler sometimes 'hangs' - No errors, etc.
I have to punch to reset switch.

I found that if I sprinkle NOP instructions throughout the source code
(and NO other changes), it finally assembles without errors after
several trial/error iterations. Does anyone know *what* causes
the assembler to hang, and how to *predictably* avoid the bug ?

Thanks.

Message-ID: <1991May02.115530.6985@cavebbs.gen.nz>

I have a Kaypro 10 which was given to me with the comment "the hard disk seems
to be a bit sick". Well, I couldn't get anything out of the HD at all, and
having obtained the formatting program, I found that I couldn't format it
either. So I concluded that the drive had died altogher.

However, I have obtained a "new" 10MB HD, and it exhibits the same symptoms
when I try to format it. The error messages I get are

	"Fatal error formatting cylinder 0 head 0, press ESC to continue"

followed by

	"Drive rejected, unable to write map on track 0"

Since it does the same thing with both drives, perhaps it isn't the drive 
after all...

Does anyone have any ideas as to what I should try next?
(After I check the cables out, that is :-)

The controller is a Western Digital 1002, the original HD is a Seagate ST212,
and the new HD is an NEC D5124 and has been tested in an MS-DOS machine.
The formatting program is the official Kaypro one.

Hi,

I have a Kaypro IV '84 which I use quite a bit as a terminal.  Currently, 
I am using the term program on the original CP/M system disk.  This program
apparently uses polling and misses multiple characters.  I would be
interested in obtaining a vt100 type emulator which does not loose
characters! :-)  Also I don't currently have the capability to download
software onto my system so I would appreciate it if anyone could mail me a
floppy.  If you can help please send e-mail and we can make further
arrangements.

Thanks!

He has moved from the Boston area to the Bay area.  His machine had several
links, some of which I could never get to work.  The one I have on file for
him that worked fine was simply wet!dg.  I always route uunet!wet!dg because
I know that is sure to work.

	Greetings. I don't know about assembler but if I try to
	compile a basic program that does not have a complete
	last line (ie. return pressed on last line) it won't hang...
	well, actually, it will read forever...

[.sig deleted]

You could try (On the dec):
PIP A:FOO.BAR=TTY:
and on the PC end:
COPY FOO.BAR COM1: (Or whatever the port is called...)

The thing to remember is that a Ctrl-Z must be sent as an EOF to get PIP to
close the file.

It would be simple to try to get the disks compatible, but if you can't
this should work.

As some other people have pointed out, the Rainbow can read single
sided PC disks (180K, oh boy.  Stop don't tease me like that).  It can
also write to freshly formatted (on the PC) singled sided disks with
some degree of reliability (eg, don't delete it off the Rainbow until
it is on the PC), but since you want to go the other way, that is
cool.

There is something called I-Drive that will allow you to connect a
real PC disk (5.25 or 3.5, no HD) to the Rainbow.  It costs $$$$.
There is also a freely available 3.5" driver for the Rainbow
available, but you need to get your own 3.5" floppy and install it
yourself.  Look at the announcement that I'll be posting to
comp.sys.dec.micro tomorrow for details.

	ok what he tells me is :
		he can't access the floppy drive,
		you can only get at the os through some contorted
			sequence of commands
		the video software don't like you to shell out
		the video software boots up automatically.
		A B and C drives are the hard drive (a 20mb)
	It is a really neato computer ( 3 terminals multiuser)
	but we would like it to do more than rent videos
	can any one help?

 Hello,
   I'm looking for a HD and controller for a KAYPRO II. I have no idea
   what to buy or where to look. I'd like something that would also
   run in a 386, if thats possible. Any suggestions would be appreciated.

One of those "rough edges" is that the object code generated by the
compiler does not protect the Z80 X and Y registers over calls to the
BDOS/BIOS. Thus, code generated by this compiler cannot be run on machines
whose CP/M BIOS implimentation destroys the X and Y registers unless the
BIOS is modified. For instance, Zmp (fine program though it may be) will
not run on a Telcon Zorba without rewriting the BIOS (something I am loath
to do since my BIOS has been modified to accommodate speech-access).
For **so** much money, it seems to me, one ought to expect better!

I just bought MIX C for CP/M on 8" and am attempting to build XLISP with
it.  Does anyone remember what changes it required or which options you
took ?  Using Aztec (which I don't have for CP/M) I believe there are some
'.ASM files for the I/O, so I'm not sure about taking those set of options.
I am laboring over V1.2, but will consider V1.1.

Mix C seems to win price/performance wise, per other notes seen here.

Hi!

Would you care to tell us more details? E.g., which computer, which release
of CP/M, which assembler, etc?

Here are some bugs that I am aware of:
   Older versions of probgrams written by David Goodenough hangs when the
   systems make use of alternate registers... Maybe your system does this
   only rarely or makes a mistake once in a while.

   If the source code is too large or the object code too large, z1.com
   tends to hang-some kind of pointer overflow, I presume.

   Someone here in the Boston area just acquired a second-hand Avatar
computer, but, as usual, the person who sold him the hardware had lost track
of almost all the documentation and software -- there is one partially
damaged boot disk, just enough to get the machine running.  With some effort
(using Uniform and DU), I was able to make a set of additional boot
diskettes.  However, we would be very grateful to anyone who could provide us
with copies of the complete Avatar software and documentation.  The new owner
cleaned up the equipment, and it now looks almost brand new!  It would be
nice to see the machine restored to a productive life.  Any help would be
greatly appreciated.

I own a Kaypro II and have a large embedded base of writings, correspondence,
C programs, etc. etc. etc.  I am in the process of buying a 386 based,
IBM compatible computer and I want to retrieve all of the data on my
floppy disks.  Years ago we used a utility that would read any number of
disk formats (including Kaypro) in the drive of a DOS machine.  Now, when
I ask at computer stores, all I get is a blank look.

Does anyone know a utility that will do this? If you could also supply the
price and a source (chain or mail order) for such a program I would really
appreciate it.

Please reply by e-mail, since I may miss a response otherwise.

CP/M was written for the Intel 8080, and all DRI versions (including, I
believe CPM3) are 8080 compatible, meaning that they >>don't<< use the  
special Z80 registers.  The CP/M BDOS, therefore, will preserve the Z80
registers since it knows nothing about them and makes no use of them.  It
was generally accepted industry practice on Z80 based machines to extend
this principle to individual machine BIOS code as well, and with only a 
few exceptions, all Z80 based computers which use the special Z80 registers
save and restore them.  Since this rather sound principle was never, to my
knowledge, incorporated into any sort of industry-wide agreement, these
few exceptions did slip through to cause trouble.  

Since there are a substantial number of programs outstanding which operate
on the assumption that the Z80 special registers are preserved across system 
calls, Jay Sage's suggestion makes more sense than trying to fix >>every<<
program which makes this assumption.  A BIOS fix for every computer which
fails to preserve the Z80 registers can be easily standardized.  A fix for
every program which assumes that they are preserved cannot.

This would seem to indicate that there is something wrong with the the
assembler itself.  Simple soultion: try a different assembler.  If you are
using the standard CP/M ASM.COM try LASM, it is compatible, fast, and will
let you have multiple source files.  It came with CP/M Kermit and i have
been using a lot since.  If you want to do more complicated stuff, try to
find M80, L80 from Microsoft.  I don't think that they are still being
made, but you might find someone witha package to sell.  Unfortunatly these
programs, whie excelent, are VERY obtuse when it cmes to command line
options.  I have to check my manual regularly when using them.

You're welcome, hope I have been of some help.

  Yes I would like something that could be switched over to the
  80386 machine if I end up not using the KAYPRO.

  From the responses I've gotten A HD for the KAYPRO would be pretty

I've added this old Commodore Pet to my collection and it appears to be

Is there by chance any other people who have or know where things like

Is there some sort of users group?

Is there a better newsgroup to ask about this?

Many thanks,  This pet is all warmed up and nothing to run on it.

The talk about MIX C in this discussion reminded me that I'd meant to call them up about a quetion I had.

I asked about getting the CP/M disks for Mix C since I already own the MSDOS version.  They told me that I could do it at the upgrade price... $5 + $2 s&h.  And that the reverse was true too!  If you have the CP/M version, you can get the MSDOS version for $5.  Of course, this isn't true for their ANSI C Compiler, PowerC, but it's only $19.95 too, so it's another great deal

So that means you could have the same compiler for both CP/M and MSDOS for under around $30 including shipping and handling.  Not a bad deal....

HELP!!  I have inherited a TELEVIDEO 803H CP/M computer, and NEED SOFTWARE!

To be more specific, it is a Televideo System TS 803H V1.4, running
CP/M version 2.2 (59K version).  

The demo I got with the computer is fun, but gets boring after 11 or 12 hours..

What I REALLY want is a word processor, perhaps WORDSTAR or something,
and I'd be willing to pay for it, although not a helluva lot.
(The computer with Hard Drive DID cost me twenty bucks..)

I know, I know... It's a dinasour, but it would mean a lot to a friend of mine
if she could give up her manual typewriter.  We's both appreciate something.

----------

   Oh, and along these lines... I've noticed that the computer has a 360k
floppy installed, much like the one in the stone age PC I am using now.
   This may be a longshot, but...  Is there any obscure peice of PC software
that can allow me to read/write to CP/M 2.2 disks?  
   If so, I could FTP CP/M software (From where? I asks...) to my pc, and have
this magic peice of software write to the 2.2 disks... Instant word 
processor! Right? Right!

Email would be graciously appreciated.

Subject: KERMIT 4.11 Installation (Help Wanted)
Message-ID: <28656@hydra.gatech.EDU>

After reading the post that KERMIT had just been re-released for
CP/M, I downloaded all the files that looked appropriate from
watsun..., and that's quite a few!  About 500KB of cp*.asm and cp*.hlp,
with a few stray items still sitting on our file system waiting
to be brought down.  (I got some reading in last night, even at
2400 Bd. [8*>)

I last assembled KERMIT in v.3.1, which was a single, fairly managable
package: I edited in the controls for my terminal, and built the *.com
with ASM and LOAD.  This looks like a _quite_ different proposition,
requiring separate assemblies, linkage, and (maybe) building a library,
overlays, help files, ???.

Has anyone out there put this package, or another recent, similar
release together?  I would like to know:
(1) Which modules do I _not_ need?
(2) Where are the hardware- and terminal-dependent parts buried?
(3) What is a good assembly and linkage sequence?
(4) I also ftp'd two hex files: kernel and generic sections.  How do
    I patch them together (ddt?), and what functions will I have/
    not have in the generic hex patch?

I expect to use M80 and L80 to accomplish the assembly and link, as
they are mentioned in the kernel source header, and I have them.
Been a _long_ time since I tried to _use_ them, tho... [8*(.

Thanks in advance.

Respond e-mail, I guess, since this may not be of very wide interest.
Similarly, I'll forward the most pertinent responses on request to
anyone else at the level of (knowledge:ignorance) to want them.

Of course, CP/M was written for 8080 and thus uses only those registers.
But if YOU as the applications programmer rely on the existance of the Z80
registers, they must be there - implying that the BIOS might use them, too.

As far as I can consider, this is simply not true. All CP/M machines I ever
came in contact with, including my own systems (meanwhile 3 different CP/M-3
implementations), dit not preserve the Z80 registers. I never had troubles,
except finding a bug in Turbo-Pascal where an index register was forgotten to
be saved during Console-Input call (but saved for Con-Out!). BTW, the program
that started this discussion (UCRLZH) runs VERY WELL on my actual machine
which does not preserve any register...

Again, I didn't make that experience. The by far more logical assumption
that in fact every register could be changed after return from BDOS, is
found in every program I ever looked at (or use, of course). More logical,
I say, because it expands the CP/M specification exactly in the same
meaning it was originally defined: 'You may rely on _NO_ register'.
Assuming some registers to be saved and some others not, is not very
consequent, is it? And never forget: If you are able to use the Z80
registers, the BIOS is able, too! (Eventually even the BDOS, if you got
a real Z80 version, which I miss hardly for CP/M-3.)

To come to an end:
Of course, it would be much easier if DRI had specified that every used
register must be saved by the BDOS and BIOS. That would have led to some
additional pushes and pops in both of them, but would have made sure that
applications programs never had to do that. Also, expansion of this spec
would be much easier (with BDOS/BIOS simply saving every used register as
before).
But, as a matter of fact, DRI did not specify that. And like it or not,
their specification is reality. DRI told every programmer NOT to rely on
ANY register, and this should also be expanded in the same meaning (thus
including Z80 registers, in this case).

[stuff deleted]
A lot of this depends on what machines you have.  If your CP/M machine is a
Kaypro, Osborne, or one of a number of other machines, programs exist to
let the CP/M machine write and copy to nad from MS-DOS diskettes.  On the
Kaypro I have COMPAT by Mycroft labs, and it works fine.  You might still
be able to find copies.  I think UNIFORM also works.

	On the MS-DOS end there are also programs to read CP/M diskettes,
but I can't think of the name of one, offhand.  Even these programs will
only read certian formats though, so without knowing what kind of computer
you have I can't be of any futher help.  Good luck!  (You might end up
finding it simpler to put a serial port on the MS-DOS computer just for
this purpose, it may be cheaper, and simpler in the long run...)

From reading the rest of your post, it seems you left out the most
important file for the moment, CPKERM.DOC.  This file is the
documentation for Kermit-80.  It was also updated for the new
release. It explains how to use kermit, and how to install it
on your system, even re-assembling if necessary.  CPKERM.PS is
cpkerm.doc on postscript format and prints a nicely formatted
Kermit-80 manual.
 
If you system is one of those supported (you never did mention
what system you were trying to get kermit to support in your
post) all you need to do is mload the overlay for your system
cpxxxx.hex with the system independent file cpsker.hex.  The
mload program is available from the kermit server along with
its documentation.

This is described in cpkerm.doc.

The hardware and terminal dependent parts are buried in the system
specific overlay file.
 
>(3) What is a good assembly and linkage sequence?
 
Kermit-80 is designed to be assembled with the LASM public domain
assembler. It can also be assembled with m80, but I have not tried
this as I don't have m80.  Since you should be able to use the
system independent hex file as you got it from the server, only one
assembly should be needed if your system is not already one of those
supported. The hex file created by lasm.com is then merged with the
system independent file with mload.com.  Lasm.com is the asm.com
assembler with a LINK command added which allow chaining of files
at assembly time.  It is also 2K smaller than asm.com.
 
>(4) I also ftp'd two hex files: kernel and generic sections.  How do

Mload.com is used to merge the system independent and system dependent
hex files into one executable .com file.  Mload and its documentation
are available from the kermit server and simtel20. If your system is
covered by one of the system dependent hex files, you do not need to
re-assemble.

Lasm.com is available from the same place you got the other kermit
sources.  It is also available on simtel20, along with its sources.
 
I hope this helps.

Try Uniform PC or 22DISK.  I suggest the latter because it's
easily avaiable, cheaper, and, unlike Uniform PC (DO correct me
if I'm wrong because I want to be able to do it), you can
configure it to read just about any format of diskette out there,
with certain obvious exceptions, of course, like hard-sectored
diskettes or non-MFM formats (YES, MFM is applicable in the
floppy diskette world for you DOS folks who are computer
neophytes) like Apple, but I hear of some cards that will read
THOSE.

At least, those that were predefined.  Like I said, 22DISK can be
configured for just about any MFM-format disk.  I had to make an
entry to read diskettes formatted on my sister's computer. Sadly,
Uniform cannot handle that.

Re: Being "of further help"

I belive I just was...  :-)

> Good luck!

If you have an old Ozzy using SSSD drives, you'll need it!  And
you'll need a controller you can modify; the instructions
therefor are in the 22DISK docs.  If you're using Uniform PC, you
just SOL, unless MicroSolutions' CompatiCard can handle SD, and I
believe that 22DISK will handle that as well.

> (You might end up

Yep, sometimes the format isn't properly interpreted by the PC or
laid down to spec by the original computer and said computer
don't give a $#!+ about the sectoring, just as long as the
intersector gaps are right and it knows how to find sector 0 and
dynamically change interleave.  I know my 8" drive does on my
Dynabyte because I try to feed "3740" formatted disks which I
format on it to my CompuPro, the data come in the wrong order; if
I format it on the CompuPro "3740", put it in the Dynabyte, write
some stuff on it, then read it on the C'Pro, it reads the sectors
in their proper order.

Thanks for all the response I got on this.  Eight respondents so far,
with many useful comments.  I probably don't need any more advice,
until I have had time to make some more mistakes.  Thanks to all.

When I get done, I'll be happy to post a note to that effect, and
send a summary then to anyone who would like it.

That sounds like the best advice:
When in doubt,
READ THE DIRECTIONS.

I haven't been using MLOAD or LASM.  Sounds like they are worth
having.

Ans: My system is a Z-80, SD-Systems, SBC-200 (or -300 .. I can't
remember).  256 KBy RAM, incl. 192K as a RAMDisk.  All that's
generic, of course.  The adaptation I meant was for my serial-
port addresses and flags (SSM-I/O4 --anyone remember SSM?), and for
the Adds Viewpoint terminal.  That's a traditional, unbreakable
CP/M _boat_anchor_, in other words.

When I patched my existing Kermit source, I added conditionals for
the cursor and screen control codes, sim. to the structure for the
Superbrain, Heath, etc..

I expect I will now write a short definition file of some kind, or
patch the *.asm for some similar industry-standard terminal.

I left most of the details out here -- just wanted to say 'Thanks'
to the numerous people who responded to my request.

	an emulator for a Z80 and run most (if not all) of my Kaypro
	stuff. Doesn't mean I don't use the K10, either. Even though
	my Kaypro 10 is far from a "portable" it's much better at it
	than the 50+ lb 486 :-)	Besides, show me a z80-based machine
	than can raytrace a 640X486X256 complex scene in under 30 minutes 
	:-)

	Take care.	

	P.S. QNOTD (Qute note of the day) Did you know that Norton

Message-ID: <19375@sdcc6.ucsd.edu>

Is there a program out there that will let me read cpm disk drives
via serial port of a pc?

The cpm machine reads like this on boot up time:

(turn key) 
JADE COMPUTER SYSTEMS MONITER 2.2B

EFFF

(insert system disk, then press 'e')

JADE COMPUTER SYSTEMS
60K CP/M 2.2 DDBIOS 2

I'd like to be able to read the cpm disk drive via pc's serial port,
so I can copy the cpm disk to pc (sort of like using dos's copy
command).  Currently I use a customized file transfer program, but I
find it rather slow for the daunting task I have (I have to transfer
500+ diskettes).  

If there exists such a program, could anyone direct me to the
source?

Please reply via email...

Thank you,

Subject: Kermit-80 Version 4.11

Dear Mr. Mills:
     In a recent Info-cpm digest, in article <26697@hydra.gatech.EDU>, 
you asked how to get Kermit-80 version 4.11. going.  Lance 
Tagliapietra's answer was a good one.  You also might want to get 
cpaaaa.hlp from watsun's ~kermit/a/ directory; this gives the machines 
that Kermit-80 currently supports along with the filenames of the Intel 
hex files for those machines.  As Mr. Tagliapietra says, you probably 
won't have to rebuild the system-independent part of Kermit-80.  If your 
CP/M machine is one of those currently supported by Kermit-80, you need 
only get the system-dependent hex file and combine them with MLOAD, DDT, 
DDTZ or whatever (MLOAD and DDTZ are my preferences since they don't 
require you to calculate image length for a CP/M SAVE).  If your system 
is not supported, pick up cpxtyp.asm, cpxcom.asm, cpxlnk.asm and 
cpxswt.asm.  Currently, systems are organized into "families", as, for 
example, Amstrad machines.  If you were going to recompile Amstrad 
Kermit's system-dependent file, you'd also get cpxpcw.asm.  Some systems 
(as, for example, the HP-125) are in the files cpxsys.asm and 
cpxsy2.asm, which you'd get.  In any case, if your system isn't 
supported, get a "family" file that's close or create one yourself.  If 
your system doesn't have a built-in terminal, you'll also need 
cpxvdu.asm (which contains terminal drivers).  Set the appropriate 
switch in cpxtyp.asm to true (or put one in for your system if it isn't 
supported), set a terminal-switch to TRUE (or select Generic CRT if 
nothing's listed for your terminal or put your terminal's codes into a 
family file or cpxvdu.asm), get LASM or M80 and compile away. L80 can be 
used to link the system-dependent file but you must be sure to do a 
/P:7000 as the first part of the L80 command tail so the REL-file has 
the proper absolute address.  You still need MLOAD, DDT, DDTZ or 
whatever to combine the files, so why not get LASM and use it, too.  
Hope this message along with Mr. Tagliapietra's message helps you.  Feel 
free to ask either him or me any Kermit-80 queries you'd like.
     By the way, I think you'll like Kermit-80 4.11.  It's got support 
for many REMOTE commands (advanced server commands).  It's only drawback 
is that it doesn't support repeat-prefixing or extended-length packets 
yet -- get QTERM version 43E (along with my bug fix for it) to get those 
features.
     Cheers!

cpxsys.asm/cpxsy2.asm.  Then compile and link. -- Mike Freeman K7UIJ --

Hello Netlanders.

I have been given an Osborne 1 (to go with my other CP/M machines).  I
was rather lucky that I got the original disks (and some others) with it
(but not manuals) and all for the price of nothing....  

However, I have some problems and some questions.   First, a bit about
the machine.  An Osborne 1, with double density drives, a rom which
states something like: 7A8007-00 Rev A D7AC OCC. There may be more roms,
etc... I didn't go looking around much.

I also got three "original" looking disks - CP/M 2.2, System and
Utility, CBASIC/MBASIC, and SUPERCALC.  A small number of other disks
came with the system, a lot of them backups/modified versions of the
above.  I think there is also a copy of WordStar somewhere in there.

Anyway, the problems:  1.  B drive refuses to read disks.  It complains
that the disks are unformatted (they are formatted, they work on drive
A).  I have taken the machine apart and looked at the drive, but I
didn't spot anything in my quick inspection that looked wrong. The
select lines make it to the right chips etc.  I ran out of time to check
the R/W data lines.   I would appreciate any suggestions that people
have for why this doesn't work and/or what to check next.  Oh, BTW, I
have tried cleaning the disk heads.   Also, if it is of use, I have an
old (5.25 Double sided, Double Density) IBM disk drive (full height, 
even... :-) -- would this work in its place?

And the next one:  2.  I have very little documentation.  Not that CP/M
itself is a problem (I have been using it for several years), but the
specifics of the Osborne are.  I know enough about the disk format to be
able to get stuff from my other machines to it, but I don't know
anything about the pinouts of the various connectors on the machine. I
presume the one labeled RS232 is pretty standard....  although I seem to
remember hearing something about it being slightly strange.
 
The modem port looks interesting -- can anyone tell me the pin outs.  I
will pull a copy of the Mex overlay for the Osborne off our Simtel
mirror (a year or so out of date, but still lots of nice stuff), and get
that going.  But that still leaves the physical cable details to
determine.  I can use a soldering iron... :-)

Thanks, in advance, for your help.   Replies by mail, or in this group.
Either should get to me pretty quickly.

There are a couple of good programs set for MSDOS machines which allow
them to read a >wide< variety of CP/M disk formats.  A pretty good
program is 22DISK from Sydex.  Their address is P.O. Box 5700, Eugene, OR
97405.  Their phones are (503) 683-6033 (voice), (503) 683-1622 (FAX) and
(503) 683-1385 (data).  22DISK consists of a set of programs which are
analogous to the copy, dir, format, type and erase functions in MSDOS except
that they see a floppy drive via a selected CP/M format.  The registered
version contains support for over 270 different CP/M formats plus the
ability to add custom formats if you know the disk setup parameters.  The
latter can be determined with another of Sydex's offerings called Anadisk
which analyzes the disk format on just about any disk except Apple and
Commodore disks, which do not use FM data encoding.  I use 22DISK and have
had good results with it.  It comes as shareware (the shareware version
doesn't support quite so many CP/M formats) and registration is reasonable
at $25.

The second option is UniForm -PC from Nicro Solutions - the same folks who
made the venerable UniForm for CP/M machines throughout the 80's.  Their
advirtising states that UniForm-PC supports "hundreds of different diskette
formats", which is probably true.  Micro Solutions is at 132 West Lincoln
Hwy, DeKalb, IL  60115.  Phones are (815) 756-3411 (voice) and
(815) 756-2928 (FAX).  UniForm-PC works essentially the same as the old
UniForm for CP/M, installing a device driver or TSR so that standard
DOS functions can be used to work on the target floppy, which is managed
in a CP/M format.  The price, I think, is somewhere between $60 and $80.

I have had good luck with 22DISK and found the the Sydex people to be 
friendly and helpful.  I do have a friend, though, who distributes CP/M
disks professionally and, having tried both, prefers UniForm-PC for
rock solid reliability (the cost of redoing and remailing an overseas
shipment of disks can exceed the cost of either program!).  22DISK allows
access to all CP/M user areas on a floppy, while UniForm-PC accesses only
user 0.

That is an accurate statement.  On my machine I can access over 300 formats in
5.25" both 48 & 96 tpi, and 8" sizes.  3" & 3.5" might add a few more.

On a related subject, I thought I might ask a similar question. I have an
Apple //c, with an Applied Engineering card which gives me cp/m capability.
It has a Z80, and the Z80 gets woken up when I boot with a cp/m diskette.
Other members of my family have various other cp/m machines, like a Heathkit
H89, and an Amstrad PCW8512 with a 5.25" disk drive. I've always wanted to be
able to read these other cp/m disk formats (all 5.25" diskettes), but of course
understand that there are problems. Like the H89 disks are hard sectored :-(

Anyway, I was interested in finding out whether there existed a program that
would enable me to read any cp/m disk format from any other machine. Eg, I
would love to be able to read stuff written on a disk formatted on a Kaypro,
or an Osborne, and have the inverse possible, like giving a Kaypro owner one
of my diskettes formatted on the Apple.

I'm not an expert on disk formats, so let me have the full story if this
is/is not possible. And flame me by email if this is the wrong newsgroup
to discuss this topic :-)

Ooh, I'm only too willing, but it still doesn't :-)

Subject: Kaypro II'83 help
Message-ID: <283AB586.2143@orion.oac.uci.edu>

I have a Kaypro II'83 which after 8 years of loyal service, lost
the ability to boot.  (Drive A can't read the boot track of ANY
disk, old, new, or master.)  I tried the drive-head cleaning trick
with no apparent effect.

I thought to myself "Self, twiddle with the innards, and get the
machine to believe drive B is A and vers vicea."  So I opened
up the poor beast, and twiddled: the two drives are on a single
controller cable; it doesn't matter which connector goes on which
drive; there must be a jumper somewhere which tells the drives
(identical in every obvious respect) their identities.

Question 1: I'd figure it out myself, if I had ever managed to
secure a copy of Chilton's Kaypro Handbook.  Anyone know how to
get one?

Question 2: Barring that, does anyone know how the drives are keyed
to their identities?

Lindsay, you're fogrgetting one thing about 22DISK.  You can
configure it to just about any disk format, which is why Sydex
includes Anadisk.  You also forgot hard-sectored disks as one of
the types of disks that Anadisk doesn't know how to deal with.

hi,

   CP/M to DOS exchangers as I have seen in my use of CP/M machines
 are computer dependent, so what's written on one machine will not/may not
 run on another.   I have a TRS-80 4P and am capable of reading the
 formats of almost any CP/M machine due to the software that was written
 for my machine.  Another piece of software was written (also computer
 dependent) which allows me to go back and forth between CP/M - MSDOS
 (several versions) and a TRS-80 operating system in any order.

   Off hand CP/M-86 has a conversion program and that was on a Zenith-100
 computer, but I don't think that was computer dependent.

   There's also one written for the Commodore 128 CP/M which is built into
 the computer's CP/M mode, which only allows you to read other CP/M formats
 only.

   For the generic Commodore there's "Big Blue Reader", which also reads
 MSDOS disks according to what I've heard.

  Under the Osborne FOG library, there's a program called PCPIP and other
 programs which copy between MSDOS and CPM, but I've never really played
 with them due to what I had.

  By the way, what kind of computer do you have, maybe I could help if I
 knew at least that much, or maybe someone else could help, worth a try...

Wright State University in Dayton, Ohio has three CP/M computers that are
being disposed.  They are property of the University and carry WSU property
tags.  They may be given ONLY to other universities, preferably to Ohio
institutions.  These machines are large ( ~ 1' X 2' X 2' ) and pretty heavy
(up to 50 lbs.).  All three machines have the following:

              Computime CPU and Floppy controller
              Dual 8" DSDD Floppies  (990kB)
              64K Internal Printer Buffer
              Real time clock, calendar
              Linear Power Supply
              Dual Serial Ports
              Single Parallel Port

In addition, two of the machines have 5.25" floppies.  These machines require
a terminal (not provided) for operation.  In the past, Lear Siegler ADM - type
terminals have been used.  At last count, all three computers were working,
but no guarantees are implied.

Postage MUST be paid by the recipient!!  There are no other charges to receive
these computers.  Save money if you want to drive to Dayton and pick them up.

My old computers are packed away at the moment, but as I reacall there is
a jumper or dip swith block for drive select (usually silkscreened on the 
printed circuit as DS0.DS1.DS2.DS3 (or sometimes starting with 1 vice 0).
The other item is terminating resistors, which are usually a DIP or SIP 
pack near the drive select jumpers.  The terminating resistors need to be on
the drive at the END of the cable.  

This was before IBM created the abomination of inserting a twist in the 
drive cable to avoid having to set the jumpers.

Subject: Osborne 1, Questions Answered
Message-ID: <1991May23.042256.12302@actrix.gen.nz>

A great big thank you to all the people who replied to my request for
help with the Osborne 1 that I have been given.

The verdict is that an IBM drive can be put into the machine, if one
tries hard enough.  One has to handle the power supply connections,
which are a separate connector on the IBM drives, but on the underside
of the Osborne drives.  The IBM drives have an earth on the underside of
the connector.  Do *NOT* try connecting it up just to find out if it
would work.  Something will melt down.

The verdict on the serial port and modem port appear to be that they are
the same control lines inside the machine.  The RS232 port apparently is
only TTL levels, so some line driver/receivr chips would be needed.
Speed choices are 300 and 1200, although there is apparently a link
inside which can make this 600 or 2400 (from IMP overlay).

The good news about my Osborne is that the B drive appears to be sort of
working.  It works once I have formatted a disk in it.  I think the main
reason that this works is that it causes the drive to step, and thus
realign onto the disk.  The BIOS in my Amstrad does this automatically
when it has problems (steps out a track, and back, and also seeks to
first/last track and back -- solves some problems).

This semi-strongly suggests an alignment problem to me, so I might have
a look around and see what I can fiddle with... :-)

Anyway, thank you very much to everyone who offered help.

Re. Kaypro II can't boot from disk A.

Very simple.
As always, there is IBM (which ignores the rest of the world) and the rest
of the world.
Since KAYPRO belongs to the rest of the world, I assume that the common 34 wire
flat cable was left intact with all wires parallel. On each of your
drives there is a set of jumpers where you almost certainly will recognize
that ONE of DS0 DS1 DS2 DS3 is jumpered; DS0 on your present A, DS1 on your
present B is ALMOST certain. Just exchange the position of these jumpers.
You will also notice that on ONE drive board there is a vacant socket compared
to the other. The vacant socket MUST be on the drive which is NOT at the end
of the cable, the thing in the socket which looks like a chip is a set of
resistors terminating the flat cable for correct impedance. Be EXCEEDINGLY
careful not to break its legs if you try to relocate that pseudo-chip on an
other drive, when you remove it.

The caveat about IBM is that for reasons which my limited brain was unable to
understand, BIG BLUE of course can't use the DSn jumpers for what there were
designed for, and obtains the same result by crossing a few wires in the cable,
which then ceases to be flat between the first and the second drive. In this
arrangement, both drives have the jumper selection in the same position.

Finally, some old (or is it recent) drives have the jumpers labelles DS1 to
DS 4, not DS0 to DS 1. Just in case some reader might need such clarification.
Also, it is NOT a Law of Nature that the lowest drive is A etc... The system
generation software with my LOBO MAX-80 allows to change these assignments.
Even if the KAYPRO has the same capability, it won't help, since you can't
boot your machine, **BUT**, if the Kaypro HAS this software, and you can run
it to write a new boot disk on an OTHER machine, then you could get a boot
from drive B without opening your machine.

Subject: 5.25" on 8" controller
Message-ID: <16528@helios.TAMU.EDU>

I have recently begun the process of putting 5.25 80-track (high-density) disk
drives on by 8" disk controller.  Although I have had some initial success,
I have hit a few snags that some people on this newsgroup may be able to help
me solve.

For the record, the significant parts of my system are:
     Extended-keyboard Apple //e (PCPI Applicard for CP/M)
        SVA ZVX4 Dual-Density 8" disk controller (in Slot 7)
           2 Shugart SA801 Single-Sided Disk drives (SA800 mode, Soft sector)

The 5.25"drives I'm adding are TEAC FD55GFR's (2).  The drives have been
jumpered for their appropriate addresses (DS2, DS3) and position 34 on the
card edge supplies a READY signal.  All corresponding interface signals have
been mapped from the 8" controller 50-pin connector to the 5.25" drives'
34-pin connector with the exception that HEADLOAD is applied to the IN-USE
position and IN-USE is applied to MOTOR-ON.

At this time, the drived are strapped to turn the motor on when the front
bezel light is lit.  This causes the drives to begin running when they are
selected, but since the controller does not de-select a drive after initial
access, they continue to run until another drive is selected.
Currently, this works to advantage because a second access is necessary to
permit a disk operation to succeed. This is most likely because either the
5.25" drive does not come READY fast enough for the controller to acknow-
ledge or the controller expects the drive to be ready before issuing 
HEADLOAD or IN-USE signals.

Question 1:  How may I get the disk drives to start up only when actually
	     accessed (not just selected) and stop when done.
Question 2:  What solution(s) are there to the apparent time-out on the
	     drive (not ready in time)?  The soolution to this may also
	     provide a solution for Ques. 1.

Qestion 3:  What are symptoms of a drive system with too many terminators
	    installed?  Can this condition manifest itself in the form of
	    errors while formatting disks?  (The 5.25" drives' terminating
	    resistiors are soldered in and the drives are in parallel with
	    the 8" drives [rather than chained after them] which also have
	    otherwise proper termination [drives DS0, DS1 with terminators
	    on DS1] for only two drives.  I have been able to format disks
	    with the 5.25" drives, but there are considerable errors in the
	    process with the drive designated DS2 at the end of the 5.25"
	    chain [tee].

Pleas note that any and all solutions must be compatible with 8" drives
remaining in the system.

I remember seeing a description of a small circuit which solved the problem
of DRIVE READY timeouts, perhaps the person who wrote that message could
email it to me as per my .sig.

Thanks for the help.

Ewen,
 
   I am talking off the top of my head right now, my tech manual are at 
the house, but I believe that the Osb-1 serial port has normal RS-232 
levels. The modem port is the port with the TTL levels, I have a 
schematic at the house to build an adapter to change the modem port to 
regular 232 levels using , 1488 and 1489 driver chips as I remember. It 
also has the resistances to insert in the other lines on the Modem Port. 
To use the Serial port with a Hayes type modem you have to use pins 2 & 
3 reversed to the modem and pin 7 to pin 7 on the modem. Imp 244 works 
real well on mine and ZMP 15 with zmodem protocal is also nice. I have a 
couple of articles on drive alignment and a mod to increase the 
readability of Osborne drive span with a capacitor change. Leave me a 
note or my address is below if you would like some of the info I have. I 
would be glad to send it to you. See you later. Love my OZZIE.

Greetings,

     I have a question about a NEC APC, running CP/M-86, with two 8"
drives.

     I was wondering if it was at all possible to completely change
over from CP/M to DOS.  If not, are file conversions possible between
the two, like converting an executable to run on the CP/M machine from
a DOS exec, if so how would I go about doing it and where would I find
the software to do it.

     Thanks in advance for any help on these questions.

You will find 'berg' jumpers on the floppy disk pc boards very near the
signal connector.  The jumper positions will be labeled ds0..3 or ds1..4
or something.  Drive A will be jumpered one way and drive B another.
Simply move the jumpers to 'swap' the drives.

Hope this helps.

Subject: Re: Osborne 1

I tried conmecting an Osborne 1 to my S100 machine via its SSM IO/4
card.  The SSM card would drive RS-232 via a 1488 chip @ +/- 12V, but
would receive RS-232 via a couple of transistors (had to do with the
board's capability of running current loops instead of EIA, if you
strapped it right).  The transistor bridge was little more than a
voltage divider (it divided the incoming voltage by 3 if I remember
right).  RS-232 signals which were driven at +/- 12V would be converted
to +/-4 Volts, which seems to work OK with the on board TTL circuts.
HOWEVER, when I connected this to the Osborne-1 serial port, I was only
getting 1-way communication.  From the SSM to the osborne worked OK.
It was the Osborne to SSM line which didn't work (at all).  This turned
out to be that the Osborne used a -9V (which while being within the EIA
specifications for RS-232C voltages) which is not common.  It did however
use +12V for the other voltage level.  The result was that the SSM receiver
would divide the -9 down to -3V which is never-never land for TTL levels,
and the SSM board woould fail.  (Now before I get flamed, I know that TTL
uses 0V (gnd) for 0, and 3.5V or so to about 9V for 1, so I must not be
remembering the entire receive circut on the SSM board from memory, and
my schematic for it is at home right now.  Somewhere the circut converted
the +/- signals into +/0V.)

While +12/-9 is within the EIA spec, the Osborne is the ONLY peice of RS-232
compliant equipment I have used with my SSM that didn't work (without a -12V
pull down being added to the input circut).  I therefore have trouble
believing that the Osborne uses "normal RS-232 levels".  I do however believe
that if the SSM board had used a 1489 for its receiver, that it would have
"done the right thing" with the signals received from the Osborne.
Caveat Empteur.

The Osborne 1 uses the standard 1488 and 1489 chips to the external port
of the RS232 interface, and uses +/- 12VDC to drive the signals. The speed
of the RS232 port can be software selectable between two speeds. There is
a way to strap the clock chip to allow up to 4800/9600 bps operation.
This information is from my Osborne 1 Technical Reference Manual,
which indicates on the schematic how to strap the clock chip.

resistor form drive B, the last drive in the chain.  place the 
Terminating resistor in Drive A.  THe T-RES will look like an intgrated 
circuite but will have a 10 ohm symbol on it.  Set drive A for DS0 on the 
jumpers, set drive B to DS1 on the jumpers.  If you jumpers begin at 1 -

Subject: Onyx terminal (OT-80) manual and TCAP wanted
Message-ID: <722@cronos.metaphor.com>

A non-Usenet friend of mine has asked me to post the
following message.  Please reply to him directly at
MCGLONE_DAVID@TANDEM.COM.

Hi, gang.  I've just picked up a late-model Onyx terminal,
an OT-80.  This is the model with a separate keyboard
featuring 16 function keys, a full cursor pad with the
arrow keys arranged in a cross, and a full number pad.
I want to replace the Televideo 950 I'm using now, but
first I need (a) a manual for the Onyx, including how to
program the function keys and the screen, and (b) a TCAP. 
Please reply to MCGLONE_DAVID@TANDEM.COM if you are
willing to sell or give me a manual or a copy of a manual
for this terminal.  I will be awaiting your replies eagerly!

I have uploaded to SIMTEL20:

pd2:<cpm.qterm>
QTERM43E.LBR	Terminal prog. X/Ymodem, Kermit & VT100 emul.
QT43SRC.LBR	Source for QTERM43E.LBR (compiles with ZSM)
QT43EFX2.ARK	Fix for a Ymodem send bug in QTERM v43E
QTPAT42.LBR	Machine-specific QTERM overlays (v42 & later)
QT-ZBA.ZY	QTERM Overlay for the Telcon Zorba

Extract the file QTERM.FOR from QTERM43E.LBR to get a synopsis of
QTERM's capabilities. New in this version is support of extended-length
packets in Kermit protocol transfers and some Kermit Server functions.

Sorry, folks.  I mis-read the data I was sent.  TX, and RX are held at
normal levels.  Some of the information I was sent, however, noted that
some control lines were held at +5V.  This confused me, when I quickly put
together a summary.

Subject: Scott Adams adventures wanted
Message-ID: <127656@tut.cis.ohio-state.edu>

I am trying to locate a copy of the *old* Scott Adams adventure games.  I
know that a disk with 11 games was sold about 6 or 7 years ago for MS-DOS
and CP/M.  Since I have the ability to run all sorts of software, either
will work.  Does anyone out in net.land have an old copy they would be willing
to part with?

Thanks,
-ethan
