Subject: Any good references for CP/M and Z80?

My favorite CP/M and Z80 books are as follows:
 
	Mastering CP/M
	By Alan R. Miller
	(C) 1983 SYBEX Inc.
 
	How To Program the Z80
	By Rodney Zaks
	(C) 1980 SYBEX Inc.
 
	Z80 Assembly Language Programming
	By Lance A. Leventhal
	(C) 1979 Adam Osborne & Assoc. Inc.
 
I don't know if the books are still available, or if they're even
still in print. I've had these for many years.  The first two books
are excellent and I highly recommend them. 'Mastering CP/M is the
best CP/M programming manual that I have seen. It provides lots of 
good examples for BDOS/BIOS calls. 'How to program the Z80' is, in my
opinion, the best Z80 assembler book. It is even better than the
Zilog Z80 manual (and they invented the z80). This book was also 
available from Radio Shack but they have discontinued it.  If you
scour some of the smaller 'Shacks you may still find it. Their 
catalog number is 62-2006.
 
Good luck in trying to find 'em!

Subject: file truncation in CP/M 2.2?

Unlike CP/M Plus, CP/M 2.2 has no truncate-file function.  This
is a useful function when a large file (e.g. a database or library file)
needs to be "lopped off", or packed down, and there's a lack of disk
space to create a temporary duplicate file.

Is there a portable method of truncating a CP/M 2.2 file, using only
BDOS calls?  I believe the following approach will work so long as the
shorter file's final physical extent (i.e. directory entry) is the
same as the original file's:

	open the file
	get file size, to set extent, S2, and record count bytes
	change record count to new number of records in final
	  logical extent
	change extent number, if necessary, to new final logical
	  extent
	clear bit 7 of S2, to mark the file/fcb "modified"
	close the file
	use function 37 to log off the drive (use the FRESET routine,
	  or function 13, if run on the buggy DRI BDOS).

The BDOS will write the changed fcb (directory entry) to the directory
when the file is closed, then rebuild the allocation vector for the
drive using the new number of records.

BUT...what can be done if the truncation results in eliminating the
last physical extent(s)?  The BDOS internally opens and closes each
physical extent of a multi-extent file.  Suppose, for example, you read
randomly the last record you wish to keep in the new file and  it's
not in the last physical extent.  Then you use the procedure above,
and the intermediate extent will be modified in the directory.

But the final extent will remain in the directory, unchanged.  Disk
logins will continue to keep the data groups reserved in that entry
allocated; they are effectively stranded.  And directory utilities
that sort extents will be badly confused.  You'd like to "erase" just
that final extent.  But this can't be done by BDOS calls.  Or can it?

Subject: STOIC Disk I/O ?

Has anyone ever modified the 8080 STOIC for CP/M-80 from SIG/M to read
and write sequential text files (or written code for use from STOIC) ?

It's set up to read source files like you load FORTH screen files for
execution but appears to stop short at that.

I'm looking for a minimal FORTH environment for CP/M-80 that does
sequential text file I/O in both limited TPA and COM-size to use from
a NEC 8500 laptop.

Thanks !

To re-iterate a suggestion of mine vis a vis the comp.binaries.cbm discussion
would it not be possible to create a "cover-all" newsgroup, called
comp.programs.eight-bit
that contains everything. I.E. CP/M binaries, source, C64 / C128 BASIC
progs, assembler source, C source, Commodore binary executables. Yeah, I
know it'd be a real mish-mash, but there is a lot of interest in a CBM
binaries / source group (if you don't believe me, go look at the last two
weeks in comp.sys.cbm :-) Add to that the fact that I am now 12 mailings
behind on getting my assembler out to .UUCP sites, gives you some idea
of the amount of interest we have here.

Please note - I have cross posted to what I believe are the relevant
newsgroups, but followups are directed to news.groups (the correct
place for them) Watch that space for details.

The file SIMCPM.IDX which has a CP/M filelist (with descriptions) is in a

I have just got the BRADFORD program from SIMTEL20. It is in two files
called BRAD2-A.ARK and BRAD2-B.ARK. The program is made by Aaron
Contorer. It may bought from him together with a manual. What it
does? It print in Near Letter Quality with your non-letter-quality
printer.

My problem: Bradford uses the backslash () as a command character.
Command words in the middle of lines are preceded by a backslash.
But the backslash is defined as one of the special norwegian letters
in the norwegian ASCII code. That makes Bradford difficult for us
in Norway (and also Denmark and Sweden).

Do you know how to use another character as the command character?
Help would be very much appreciated...

256K in 32K banks), and a CTC chip option (for generating interrupts at 
regular intervals) Can MP/M use existing BDOS/BIOS code?

Thanks for any info.

Help!  They're getting rid of the TOPS-20 system here, and I need

The problem I'm having is that when I've done a GET from SIMTEL20 (via

download to my Kaypro via kermit, the libary is no good.
 The .LBR directory is intact, as are all files that are normal ascii.
 The problem is with the crunched files.  NONE of them can be typed,
 uncrunched, or reassembled in any way.
  Do I have to ascify, bytify, or something-ify the file before I download
  it, or is the problem with FTP?

I would like to give one more vote FOR something of this sort.  The 
ARPA CP/M archives (SIMTEL et al.) are a great public service, but
are very inconvenient for us non-ARPA folks to use.

The result is that we never see any of the new software that 
gets absorbed into the ivory tower of the ARPA archives.

It is unfortunate that this situation is perpetuated by ARPA threatening
to drop their gateway if anyone even thinks of posting source or binaries
on the net.

A newsgroup for non-ARPA sites (specifically non-gatewayed) which
carried sources would be a great compromise.  The situation now
is far too biased towards the needs/wants/requirements of the ARPA
group, to the detriment of the community at large.

Thanks for the answers to my earlier question about VT100
terminal emulators for Kaypro.
I tried VT100KAY from the Simtel archives and it works pretty well,
although it sometimes messes up by doulbe-spacing when it shouldn't
(probably wrapping around on long lines or something).

Anyways, I'm now looking for a way to save screens for future reference.
Is there a program you can load it that will give you a hot key
that will either dump the current text screen out to the printer
(like the PrintScreen key on an IBM PC), or capture the current screen into
a file?

I tried KPVID, but this only puts graphics screens into a file
(at least I think that's what the documentation means), and it
is a separate command you have to run after getting out
of your program.

Or, do any of the terminal programs people recommended to me
have these features?  Just capturing the terminal session 
character by character (logging) is not good enough, because the cursor
is jumping all around the screen updating the display.

Thanks again for any help you can give.

Subject: Need help with Unix FTP and Kermit

It sounds like you are running kermit on the unix machine with file type
set to text.  Since unix text format is

 a line of stuff<LF>

when it is sent out by things like ftp, kermit, xmodem, etc. they insert
a <CR> in front of the <LF>'s.  This works fine for text files but
wrecks havoc on binary files.

You can either invoke kermit with

kermit -xi

which sets kermit into server mode (the 'x') and sets file type to binary
(the 'i'), or run it with no parameters and do a 'set file type binary'
before going to server mode.  This is available in all the C-Kermit
versions that I have used. (currently using 4E(070) 29 Jan 88)

If you do download a text file while set to binary, the file will
contain no carriage returns and the lines
					 will trail
						   across the screen
								    like this.

There is a program available at Simtel20 that will un-unixize these
type files by adding the <CR>'s.  I don't have my list handy so I can't
tell you what it is called right off.

hope this helps.

I spend a lot of time transferring new SIMTEL20 CP/M files to my RCP/M

The "threat" of discontinuing the Usenet<-->Arpanet gateway is simply
a reality that on the Arpanet side the CP/M newsgroup is a mailing
list.  This sends out hundreds of copies of each posting and you can
see what large program postings would do to us.  It would not only
overload the mail system but it would result in many readers missing
the regular discussions because their disk quotas would be exceeded

Subject: Posting 8 bit sources and binaries

The users of the 'arpa' side of the internet and the 'non-arpa'
are probably equally heterogeneous (myself, I'm actually on the
mil side).  So saying the usenet user needs are different
from an arpanet/simtel20 user is making a distinction where
there probably isn't any.

The problem is one of network abuse and capacity consumption.
If you post things like binaries, all those newsgroup sites get
tons of bits, whether the users want them or not.  The
solution within arpanet was to use simtel20 -- you only use
the network capacity you need to download what you want.

Unfortunately, we are running into a problem.  Defense Communications
Agency, which operates both the arpa and mil parts of DDN isn't
really in the business of providing us comms services as a free
good.  In a year or so, we will all be paying packet charges
for the services -- DCA has to pass the costs back to the users.
One of the unanswered questions is how you manage repositories like
Simtel20 or CU20B -- the costing algorithm does not account for
this at all.  Nobody in DCA really wants to kill them, but
they don't have a decent way to keep them providing the services.
Worse, while we can all see the benefits of these bboards, they
will be difficult to justify too -- who pays the packet charges
for bboard traffic?  The poster?  
If the reader is to incur them, he will have to pay
whether he actually reads or not.  Sticky.

So when Keith enforces the discipline, there are some very good
reasons.

ascii, but not graphics, characters when the hot-key/command is
pressed, then restores the cursor and screen to its original state.
This feature requires a screendriver.  Drivers are included for
both types of Kaypros ('83 and '84), Wyse 50, TVI, Heath/Zenith 19,
and a number of other terminals, as well as info on writing a new
driver.

For Kaypros, there are at least 2 roms that contain the low-level
primitives for dumping the screen to a character device.  The TurboRom
is one; I forget the name of another.  Dumping to a file requires
bdos-re-entrancy and therefore something like BGii.

Bradford allows the command character (\) and the lead-in character
(.) to be redefined. Just insert the following command at the 
beginning of your text:

	.dcc~		{defines the tilde as the command char}
	.dcl^		{defines the caret as the lead-in char}

The .dcc command can be used to set any character to be the command
character.  Just substitute the desired character for the tilde. The
same applies for the .dcl command.

Bradford is actually a lot more powerful than the .DOC file indicates.
Many commands are not documented.  If you really find Bradford useful,
order a manual from the author.  It fully explains the use of ALL of
the commands.  The macro capabilities are quite extensive!  For the
price ($25 U.S.) it is a bargain.

You indicated that you got your copy from SIMTEL20.  As yet, I have not
figured out how to access SIMTEL20.  Could you give a brief explaination
of the commands used to access/download files?

Subject: Getting Files from SIMTEL20 via FTP

On our VAX you have to convert a .LBR or .ARC file from TOPS20 to VAX
file structure before downloading to a CP/M or MSDOS system with Kermit.
There is a program in a VAX library on SIMTEL20 called BINTNXVMS that 
does this.  First capture the .LBR file in 8 bit using ftp BINARY
command.  Then RUN BINTNXVMS.  (Keep the file to be converted in a
separate directory since BINTNXVMS.EXE converts everything in sight.)
Then capture the file with Kermit.  Be sure to set the file type to 
BINARY at both the host Kermit and the receiver Kermit.  Note that 
XMODEM (at least the version on our VAX) won't do.  We have to use 
Kermit.

                 How to access the SIMTEL20 archives
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Subject: How to access the SIMTEL20 archives

[Here is the latest "archive blurb"]

                     THE SIMTEL20 ARCHIVES

OVERVIEW

There is a collossal amount of free public domain software for the
CP/M, PCDOS/MSDOS and UNIX operating systems, and for the DoD standard
programming language, Ada, in several archives on SIMTEL20.ARPA, a
DECsystem-20 running the TOPS-20 operating system at White Sands
Missile Range.  Archives of correspondence for several newsgroups,
including INFO-CPM, are also available.

You can obtain these files using the InterNet file transfer
protocol, FTP (described in a following paragraph), with user-name
"anonymous". For a login password, use your host-name or any other
string of printing characters.  Throughout this message, FTP
examples are given in a GENERIC syntax.  You will have to consult
either local documentation or your friendly system wizard to learn
the actual syntax used with your local mainframe operating system.
For the sake of brevity, the domain suffix ".ARPA" will be dropped
from further references to SIMTEL20 in this discussion.

To obtain directory listings, connect to SIMTEL20 via FTP and do this:

  get pd2:<cpm>cpm.crclst
  get pd2:<cpmug>cpmug.crclst
  get pd2:<sigm>sigm.crclst
  get pd1:<msdos>msdos.crclst
  get pd1:<pc-blue>pc-blue.crclst
  get pd1:<misc>misc.crclst
  get pd2:<unix-c>unix-c.crclst
  get pd2:<ada>ada.crclst

The <CPM> archive is the one to watch for the very latest CP/M
offerings, as it is updated frequently.  The <CPMUG>, <SIGM> and
<PC-BLUE> archives contain software distributed by the CP/M Users
Group, the SIG/M Users Group and the PC-Blue Users Group respectively.
This software is available on diskettes from the associated users
groups, and the archives are updated as new volumes are issued.  The
<PC-BLUE> archive contains software for the IBM-PC and similar
machines.  Some runs under CP/M, and some under PCDOS/MSDOS.  The
<MSDOS> archive also contains software for the MSDOS and PCDOS
operating systems; but this archive is locally managed, and therefore
is updated more frequently than the <PC-BLUE> archive.  The <UNIX-C>
archive contains a variety of UNIX tools.  Those which apply
specifically to CP/M are in the directory <UNIX-C.CPM>.  The <ADA>
archive is growing rapidly. Information about this archive is in
directory PD2:<ADA.GENERAL>.  In general, the archived software is
very good, having been worked-over and refined by many users.  The
documentation and comments tend to be complete and informative.  Files
in all of these archives can be obtained using the FTP procedures
described in this message.

PLEASE NOTE: Due to the large number of files available, the archive
maintainers cannot possibly attempt to validate the proper operation of
the various programs.  When a program bug is reported, immediate action
is taken to either correct the error or remove the offending program
from the archives.  Still, users must understand that all archive
programs are offered AS IS, and the archive maintainers specifically
disclaim any liability should these programs malfunction or cause
damage, incidental or otherwise.  When testing ANY new software, be
certain that all information stored on disk is backed-up before you
start, so that you can recover if files are damaged or erased.  This is
particularly true if you have a hard disk, in which case malfunctions
can be spectacularly disasterous.

FILE TYPES

Files are stored in two formats: Text files such as those with names
that end with DOC, HEX, INF and ASM are sometimes stored as ASCII
files, but usually these files are stored in binary squeezed form.
Binary storage is also used for executable (COM) and library files.
Squeezed and library files are described below.  All binary data are
stored as four 8-bit bytes per 36-bit SIMTEL20 word, with the low-order
four bits of each word filled with zeros.  If such a file is
interpreted as a contiguous string, as will happen if a straight binary
transfer is made to a 16 or 32-bit UNIX machine, the four zero filler-
bits per 36-bit group will cause rather bizarre and frustrating
results.  The methods for dealing with this situation, which differ
from machine to machine, are explained in a following paragraph.

Squeezed and crunched files have been compressed using programs
available in directory <CPM.SQUSQ> to obtain a significant size
reduction.  Squeezed files can be identified by the letter Q in the
second letter of the extension field.  For example, the file
PD2:<CPM.ASMUTL>RMACPAT.AQM is a squeezed file.  It must be
transferred as a binary file, and then unsqueezed.  The unsqueezing
can be done on a CP/M system using USQ-xx.COM (where "xx" is the
current version) from directory <CPM.SQUSQ>, or there are several
host-based unsqueezers in the <CPM> and <UNIX-C> archives (see for
example, directories <MISC.TOPS-20> and <UNIX-C.CPM>).  Files with
the letter Z as the second letter of the extension field are crunched.
Uncrunch programs can be found in the same directories as the
unsqueezer programs.

CP/M library and archive files (those with names ending in LBR and ARK)
combine several regular CP/M files into a single BINARY file which
contains an internal directory of its contents.  LBRs are created using
the CP/M library utility LU310.COM or some other compatible utility.
The complete packages for LU310 and a newer compatible program called
NULUxx (where "xx" is the version) can be found in directory
PD2:<CPM.ARC-LBR>.  C-language source code for compatible UNIX
utilities for System V and Berkeley versions of UNIX are in directory
PD2:<UNIX-C.ARC-PROGS>.

For more information on ARC, ARK, LBR, squeezed and crunched files,
get PD2:<CPM>-FILES.DOC and/or PD1:<MSDOS>-FILES.DOC.

Although the type of storage used for a particular file can usually be
inferred from the file-name, this is not always true.  It is a good
idea to check the appropriate "crclst" file to ascertain the storage
format used for each file of interest.  Now, and for the foreseeable
future, storage formats for files in the <SIGM>, <CPMUG> and <PC-BLUE>
archives can be determined from their "generation numbers", as shown by
the FTP directory command.  For example, the FTP command:

  dir pd1:<pc-blue.vol001>

will yield results of the form:

  -CATALOG.001.2
  ABSTRACT.001.2
  BW.ASM.2
  BW.BAS.1
  BW.EXE.1
  COLOR.ASM.2
  COLOR.BAS.1
  COLOR.EXE.1
  ...and so on

All files with names ending in ".1" are stored in binary format, and
those with names ending in ".2" are stored in ASCII.  This relationship
will continue to apply for files in the <SIGM>, <CPMUG> and <PC-BLUE>
archives until further notice.

WARNING: Because the public domain archives on SIMTEL20 consume a huge
amount of disk space, storage capacity will be conserved by the
greatest practical use of libraries and squeezed files, both of which
are stored in binary format.  If you cannot properly transfer binary
files, you are going to be VERY FRUSTRATED!  If you need help, please
contact your local system wizard and provide him/her with a copy of
this message.  Having done that, if you are still unable to make things
work correctly, send a message to INFO-CPM-REQUEST@SIMTEL20.ARPA and
I will try to help you.  Please provide the following information:

 1. Machine and operating system  (e.g., VAX-11/780, 4.2 BSD UNIX)
 2. Network software in use  (e.g., 3-Com UNET)
 3. Complete list of available FTP commands  (e.g., GET, PUT, etc.)

Important files in the <CPMUG> and <PC-BLUE> archives are the
CATALOG files. These files, which are stored in ASCII, contain the
"-CATALOG.nnn" files from all the volumes of their respective archives.
To obtain these composite catalog files, connect to SIMTEL20 via FTP
and do this:

  get pd2:<cpmug>cpmug.cat
  get pd1:<pc-blue.vol000>pcblue.cat

Similar files exist for the <SIGM> archive, but they are stored in
squeezed form.  These files, when unsqueezed, yields SIG0.CAT and
SIG1.CAT (the catalog).  They can be obtained using the FTP command:

  get pd2:<sigm.vol000>sig0.cqt
  get pd2:<sigm.vol000>sig1.cqt

(NOTE: That's "L-and-three-zeros" in "vol000")

FILE TRANSFER VIA FTP

FTP stands for File Transfer Protocol, a formalized procedure for
moving files among machines on the Defense Data Network (DDN) and other
networks that connect with the DDN.  The protocol is implemented by a
program often called FTP.  The different mainframe operating systems
implement FTP with variations in command syntax.  Some systems have the
remote-file-name precede the local-file-name in the command.  Others
reverse this order.  Some versions have the whole command on a single
input line, while others use multiple lines.  Read the documentation
for your local system, or consult a friendly system wizard for the
details of your local FTP command syntax.

UNIX users can do something like "man ftp" for on-line instructions.
However, not all UNIX FTP programs are called "ftp", so you may have
to snoop around in the system directories or ask a system wizard for
the correct local name to use with the "man" command.  ITS users can
do ":INFO FTP", and "HELP FTP" works on TOPS-20 and some other
operating systems.  I will be happy to update this message with
pointers to other sources of on-line documentation if they are sent
to INFO-CPM-REQUEST@SIMTEL20.ARPA.

FTP transfers from SIMTEL20 can be made with user-name "anonymous".
Use GUEST for the password.  For anonymous logins, SIMTEL20 supports
the FTP "change working directory" command.  (Your local syntax may
be something like CD, or CWD).  Ignore the message which may appear
that prompts you to enter a password.  This command allows you to
specify a default SIMTEL20 directory to be used for all file
retrievals, and thereby relieves you from having to repeatedly type
"pdx:<whatever>" as part of each filename.  For example, you can do
something like this:

  cd pd2:<cpm.goodstuff>
  get filename-1
  get filename-2
  ...and so on

instead of using the longer filename forms shown in previous examples.

Users of TOPS-10, TENEX, TOPS-20 or ITS systems can use "image" or
"paged" mode for ALL transfers.  UNIX users must use "ascii" mode for
ASCII files, and "type tenex" or "type L 8" mode for binary files.
MULTICS users can use "ascii" mode for ASCII files, but binary files
require special treatment that is best described by the following
example provided by Paul Schauble <Schauble@mit-multics.arpa>:

 !ftp simtel20
  220 SIMTEL20.ARPA FTP Server Process 5Z(14)-7 at Mon 10-Sep-84 00:27-MDT

  user_ftp:  !login anonymous
  331 ANONYMOUS user ok, send real ident as password.
  Password:  !guest

  user_ftp:  !quote "type l 8" <--(NOTE: That's lowercase "L" 8.)
  200 Type L bytesize 8 ok.

  user_ftp:  !get micro:<cpm.zcpr3>alias.hlp alias.hlp
  150 Retrieve of MICRO:<CPM.ZCPR3>ALIAS.HLP.1 started.
  226 Transfer completed.
  Total elapsed time:  35.7 seconds.
  4348 bytes transferred in 18.5 seconds (1850 bits/sec).

  user_ftp:  !quit
  221 QUIT command received. Goodbye.

Lines beginning with "!" are typed by the terminal user. The received
files are stored on MULTICS with one 8-bit byte per 9-bit word, and can
be transferred to a microcomputer with Kermit (described in a
following paragraph).

All aspects of the FTP process for UNIX machines have been automated
to a high degree by a program in directory PD2:<UNIX-C.CPM>. With this
program, a simple command like "mb modm700.com" can connect to
SIMTEL20 and transfer the binary file "modm700.com" from directory
PD2:<CPM.MODEM7> to a local file also named "modm700.com", all with no
user intervention.  Batch command files containing multiple lines of
the form in the above example can be run in no-hangup background mode
to transfer whole directories without the user even remaining
logged-in on his local system.  For more information, get the file
PD2:<UNIX-C.CPM>AUTOFTP-DOC.TXT.

PROGRAMS FOR TRANSFERRING FILES AMONG MAINFRAMES AND MICROS

Christensen Protocol Mainframe Programs:

For a micro to reliably exchange files with a mainframe, cooperating
file transfer programs with automatic error detection and
retransmission of faulty blocks must be running on both computers. One
such family of programs uses a popular protocol created by Ward
Christensen and enhanced by others.  Directory PD2:<UNIX-C.XYZMODEM>
contains several programs, XMODEM, UC and the older UMODEM (all
written in C), which implement this protocol on UNIX machines.  See
the file PD2:<UNIX-C>UNIX-C.CRCLST for a list of other useful UNIX
utilities.

On ITS machines, file transfer using the Christensen protocol can be
done using MMODEM (type :MMODEM for instructions), or LMODEM.
Documentation for LMODEM is in file .INFO.;LMODEM HELP. Other useful
ITS utilities include:

 TYPE8  - types an ASCII file stored in ITS binary format.
 TYPESQ - types an ITS binary format "squeezed" file (see the first
          paragraph under FILE TYPES).
 USQ    - creates an unsqueezed version of a squeezed file.
 HEXIFY - creates an Intel hex format file from an ITS binary format
          COM file.
 COMIFY - creates a COM file from an Intel hex file.
 CRC    - computes the Cyclic Redundancy Check value for a file, using
          the same algorithm that is used by the CP/M program CRCK.

Brief instructions for any of these utilities except LMODEM can be
obtained by typing ":utility_name" (for example, :CRC).

The ITS utilities listed above are also available for use with TOPS-20,
but since ITS binary format is no longer being used for the SIMTEL20
archives, these utilities have been converted to work with TOPS-20
binary formats.  A collection of TOPS-20 utilities for transferring and
manipulating files can be found in directory PD1:<MISC.TOPS-20>.  See
PD1:<MISC>MISC.CRCLST for a list of available programs.

File transfer and conversion utilities for use with VAX/VMS machines
are contained in directory PD1:<MISC.VAXVMS>.  See MISC.CRCLST for
details.

Christensen Protocol Microcomputer Programs:

An excellent program for transferring files between micros, or between
micros and mainframes is called MODM700.  This program, often referred
to as MODEM7 (the name of its easier to pronounce ancestor), uses the
popular Christensen protocol to transfer files with automatic error
detection and retransmission of erroneous blocks.

To get started with MODM700, you should first FTP and examine the "DOC"
and "MSG" files from the binary library file PD2:<CPM.MODEM7>MODM700.LBR.
The "DOC" and "MSG" files are actually stored in the library in
squeezed form, so you will have to perform three steps to get them:

   1. FTP the binary library file.
   2. Extract the elements having filename extensions of "DQC" and
      "MQG". If you have no facilities for doing this on your
      mainframe host (see the earlier comments on mainframe-based
      library utilities), then you will have to transfer the library
      to a microcomputer and extract the necessary elements there.
      If this requirement seems to put you in a "Catch-22" situation
      because you have no facilities for mainframe-to-microcomputer
      transfers, there is a way out; read the "Getting Started"
      section which follows.

   3. Use an "unsqueezer" (described above) to convert the "DQC" and
      "MQG" files extracted from the library into "DOC" and "MSG"
      files. As in the case of the library extractions, unsqueezing
      can be done on either a mainfrome host or a microcomputer,
      depending on your circumstances.

Together, these files will tell you just about all there is to know
about getting MODM700 to run on your machine. Take the time to read
them; they're quite informative.  You will also get some helpful
insights from reading some of the overlay files. These overlays,
described in file PD2:<CPM.MODEM7>M7OVL-yy.LST, are used to customize
MODM700 for particular machines without having to edit and assemble
the huge MODM700 source file.  Complete instructions for performing
this procedure are contained in each overlay file.  The letters "yy"
in the above filename should be replaced with two digits giving the
current version number as determined from CPM.CRCLST.

And then, there is MEX. MEX stands for "modem executive", and it is
just what the name implies, a communications and file-transfer
program with a built-in mini operating system that runs under CP/M.
This program can do file transfers using either the Christensen or
Compuserve protocol, and it has an enormous potential for highly
automated operations because it can read and execute command-scripts
pre-stored in disk files.  These scripts can include sending
commands to a remote computer, as if they had been sent manually
from the microcomputer in terminal-mode.  Users of this relatively
new program are still exploring its possibilities.  For more
information, look in CPM.CRCLST under the heading "PD2:<CPM.MEX>",
and then get the various files that have "DQC" and "IQF" in their
names.  These DOCumentation and INFormation files are stored in
squeezed form (note the "Q" in the filename extensions), so you will
have to unsqueeze them.  Overlays for MODM700 will also work with
MEX, but they will not provide all of the extended MEX features.

Kermit:

Another excellent program for transferring files is called KERMIT. This
program has the advantage of being available for an impressively large
number of mainframes and micros. It is, for example, available for the
IBM-PC, and it DOES NOT require CP/M.

To get started with KERMIT, connect to CU20B.COLUMBIA.EDU using FTP,
and do this:

  get ker:aaaread.me

Note that this file is NOT on SIMTEL20, and the name is subject to
change.  If you cannot find a file with this name, snoop around in the
first half-dozen or so files in the alphabetical listing obtainable
using the FTP directory command:

  dir ker:

You should find something useful.

  Questions can be addressed to INFO-KERMIT-REQUEST@CU20B.COLUMBIA.EDU.

Getting Started:

In order to get MODM700, MEX or KERMIT running on your micro, you must
first transfer the necessary files from mainframe to micro. If you
already have a receive-to-disk communications program of some sort, you
can use it to move the needed files.  In the long-run it is essential
to be able to transfer 8-bit binary files, but initially it is not
absolutely necessary.  Some of the files are quite large.  For example,
MODM700.COM is over 18K bytes, and the HEX file (which you will need if
you can't transfer 8-bit files) is over 45K.  Moving large files to
your micro without using an error detecting protocol can result in
frustrating errors, but it can be done by receiving multiple copies and
using manual or machine-assisted comparisons to locate and repair bad
parts of the code.  However, there IS a better way.

Directory PD2:<CPM.STARTER-KIT> contains a short starter-program called
PIPMODEM.ASM that can be FTPed to your mainframe, printed, and then
entered into your microcomputer by hand and assembled.  This can then
be used to down-load either MBOOT3.ASM or BMODEM.BAS (depending on
whether you prefer assembly language or BASIC), both of which can
receive files using the error detecting Christensen protocol.  Once you
have this capability, you can download the full-function file transfer
program of your choice.  To examine this option, connect to SIMTEL20
via FTP and do this:

  get pd2:<cpm.starter-kit>pipmodem.asm
  get pd2:<cpm.starter-kit>pipmodem.doc
  get pd2:<cpm.starter-kit>mboot3.asm
  get pd2:<cpm.starter-kit>bmodem.bas
  get pd2:<cpm.starter-kit>bmodem.doc

All are ASCII files.  Read PIPMODEM.DOC first, then look at MBOOT3.ASM
and BMODEM.DOC.  PIPMODEM.DOC explains the situation very nicely.
Questions concerning these programs should be sent to
INFO-CPM@SIMTEL20.ARPA (NOT to INFO-CPM-REQUEST).

NEWSGROUP CORRESPONDENCE ARCHIVES

Copies of correspondence for several newsgroups are kept on SIMTEL20
in directories with names of the form PD2:<ARCHIVES.KEYWORD>, where
"KEYWORD" has been chosen to indicate the associated newsgroup. At
present, the following correspondence archives are available:

Descriptions of these and other newsgroups can be obtained via FTP with
anonymous login (as for SIMTEL20) from the Network Information Center's
host SRI-NIC.ARPA.  Ask for the file PS:<NETINFO>INTEREST-GROUPS.TXT
(an ASCII file).  And please note, this is NOT on SIMTEL20.

File names for SIMTEL20 newsgroup correspondence archives have two
forms. For example, PD2:<ARCHIVES.CPM>CPM.ARCHIV.ymmdd is a group of
files containing INFO-CPM correspondence going back several years. The
characters "ymmdd" in the file names are actually digits giving the
year, month and day of the last message in each particular file.  Current
correspondence is kept in the file PD2:<ARCHIVES.CPM>CPM-ARCHIV.TXT, which
is constantly changing. Although INFO-CPM has been used as an example
here, the same naming scheme is used for the other newsgroup files as
well.  For a complete list of available files, connect to SIMTEL20 via
FTP and do this:

  dir PD2:<ARchives>

You will receive a list of names of the form:

  KEYWORD.DIRECTORY.n

where "n" is one or more digits.  For example, the INFO-CPM listing
currently appears as "CPM.DIRECTORY.1"  To then get a list of files in
a particular archive, do this:

  dir PD2:<ARchives.keyword>

where "keyword" (for example, "cpm") is chosen from the preceding list,
and the word "directory" and the number "n" are not used.  At present,
all of these files are stored in ASCII.

Subject: FTPing binary files from SIMTEL20 to VAX/VMS hosts

If you have been FTPing our binary files from SIMTEL20 to your VAX/VMS
host using the Wollongong TCP/IP ftp program and either getting
garbage or post-processing the result with the BINTNXVMS program to
fix the file, here is the correct sequence of commands:

binary
quote "type l 8"
get filespec    or mget filespec (if all the filespec files are binary)

Do NOT use bget.  The above sequence results in correctly formatted
files without the use of the BINTNXVMS program.

There is a tenex command, but this was incorrectly implemented and
has been fixed for the next release of TWG ftp for VAX/VMS.

Many moons ago there was a Z-80 based micro with FORTH in ROM called
a Jupiter Ace.  If anyone out there knows where I can get accesories,
peripherals, parts, or just wants to compare notes please get in
touch with me.  I'm trying to build an external keyboard and serial
interface for it, and then maybe port the FORTH to CP/M-80 and/or make
a cross-compiling environment from CP/M-80 to use the Jupiter as a

Anybody know of a source of 22 X 2 edge card connectors ?

If you are sending 8bit data, better check to be sure your modem (if it is
a 'smart' version which puts 2 uarts between your computer and the computer
you are modeming with) is set for 8 bits, as well as your comm program.

Otherwise, you would lose bit 7 (or 8, if you like counting bits from 1, or 0
if you count backwards) on EVERY byte.  Not bad for ascii, terrible for binary.

Of course, you could 'uuencode' it, assuming that is possible on the system
you are downloading from.  Procedure would be:  uuencode it on the host,
send it and capture locally (it is now 'only' ascii chars), uudecode it on
your machine.  But binary is much faster.

Hear here.

This seems to be far and away the best solution. If sources are
posted to usenet and available from simtel20 on arpa, surely that
should keep everyone happy?  Shutting down the gateway seems rather
drastic and unecessary, as it does operate quite satisfactorily for
discussions.  The suggestion to put a header like "_PROGRAM_" in the
subject field and filter such articles out at the gateway would be
very difficult to enforce.

At the moment I (and doubtless many other Usenetters) have absolutely
no access to CPM programs, which is mildly irritating. Requests by
mail for response from servers such as simtel20 always fail somewhere
along the line.

Will somebody formally propose a new group comp.os.cpm.sources then?
It's not clear whether it would be best to have it moderated or
unmoderated. Perhaps it should be moderated if the volume is likely
to be high, to ensure it gets propagated to Europe. Any volunteers?

(US usenetters complaining that people on Internet mailing lists don't
appreciate they're only part of "the" net note: the same applies to
them - Europe is part of the net too!)

Subject: ZCPR33 for the Kaypro 1

I recently bought a Kaypro 1 -- at $199 from COMB, I couldn't resist.  Shortly
thereafter, I discovered the system-specific ZCPR3 implementation
(pd2:<zsys.install>k1z3in.lbr) on SIMTEL20 and installed it on my machine. It
works great and added many useful features, but unfortunately it won't run many
of the new utilities designed specifically for ZCPR 3.3. 

Is there a similar Kaypro 1 installation package for ZCPR33 elsewhere on
SIMTEL20?  If not, could someone who's installed it make one available?

[description of how to do it]

Yes - changing the file size (.fcb + 0fh) will do what you want - this is
how xsub works.

> BUT...what can be done if the truncation results in eliminating the

> ..... But this can't be done by BDOS calls.  Or can it?

No it can't. but it CAN be done portably with BIOS calls. By inspecting
the bios tables (use the "get dpb address" function from bdos) you can
figure out exactly where the directory is, and how big it is. Now keep
on reading directory sectors using bios till you hit the one with the
extent that you want to nuke. Now just replace the first byte in the 32
byte entry with 0e5h, write it back (see caveat) and voila!
CAVEAT: whatever you do, when you write this sector back, reuse the
bios select disk, track, and sector routines, AND MAKE SURE C CONTAINS 1.
At least one bios I've seen destroys the track/sector info on each
read/write, so it's a good idea to reset them. Setting C to 1 forces
the write to happen: usually on bioses where the sector size is
greater than 128 bytes (i.e. all 5.25" DD versions) when a write happens,
the data is just buffered, and only gets flushed when another write to a
different sector occurs. By making C == 1, it forces the bios to write,
hence the directory is kept up to date.

Easy Huh? :-) :-)

Subject: Latest Z-System for Kaypro (and All Other Machines)

   Richard Kershenbaum asked about ZCPR33 for his new Kaypro 1.  I would
recommend that you order the new automatic, universal, dynamic Z-System
called NZ-COM.  It installs automatically on a CP/M-2.2 machine, includes
ZCPR34, and allows the operating system to be changed on the fly so that
you can trade off system features with TPA dynamically, depending on what
task you are working on.  I just finished the 70+ page manual today, and
it will be on its way to the printer tomorrow.  Cost is $69.95 from me or
from Joe Wright, Alpha Systems, 711 Chatsworth Place, San Jose, CA 95128.
You will not be disappointed.

If you'll be posting binaries, then I think the group should be
moderated.  Otherwise, there'll be too great an opportunity for
irresponsible person(s) to post malicious programs nested within
seemingly useful utilities, etc.  

Of course, there is always the problem then of who to moderate.  I'm

     Z33 can be *easily* installed into the package you already have.  If you
have a Z3BASE.LIB file for the configuration you're running, all you have to
do is assemble ZCPR33.Z80 with that as input.  Then slam the resulting .HEX
file into your system image.

     If you don't have Z3BASE.LIB, it gets a little more complicated.  Use
Z3LOC to build Z3BASE.LIB.  You should have a copy of your configuration
floating around, anyway.


     About two years ago, I did a manual install for ZCPR3 for my Ampro
LB/Z80.  When I got Z33, all I did was re-assemble.  It *is* a drop-in
replacement.

Mitsubishi's California headquarters says "Use the MF504A instead."
We say "It's not 100% compatible."  They say "Tough."

Additional info: these drives are for use on a Pulsar Electronics (from
Australia) Z80 cpu card with built-in disk controller (Western Digital

in reference to keith's posting about the availability of sources on his

without problems..  in fact, i prefer it.  i don't have to worry about
code that's gotten munged or truncated while passisng through a site, and
in the case of binary files -- i don't need to worry about splicing all
the parts and uudecoding.

connect charges are low enough on genie at 1200 baud to make it a
reasonable option.

i really don't care to take sides on this issue, however i did feel the
need to back up keith's claim that the files are posted, are available,
and at what i consider to be a very reasonable price (toll call/genie).

i appreciate his efforts in this area.

four Tarbell double density disk controllers (software for them too),
Godbout Z80 CPU cards, various and sundry memory cards, I/O cards, etc.
There's also a decent collection of CP/M and CP/M-86 software on 8"

I need to make some room and am willing to part with these treasures
for *very* reasonable prices.  I mean like free to a charitable outfit
who can use it, or a youngster getting started.  Like $10-20 for a

goes without the card for which it was written :-)  There are a couple
of Imsai chassis and DSDD 8" floppy systems too.  No doc on the Imsai's.

Is anyone out there interested in such stuff?  If so, please email to

Subject: Altos 580, BBS's.

[munch]

I have "inherited" an Altos 580. For those of you with short memories,
this is a 4-user MP/M-II system circa 1983. It has a 10 megabyte hard
drive, and is just sitting there, doing nothing but collecting dust
(along with my ultra-modern Hazeltine terminal, which I similarly
aquired). I've used the machine a little, and it's quite a neat
machine, but I'm afraid it's a little outdated alongside of the Amiga
on the next desk.

My question: Is there a BBS program that can be used with this
machine? I am aquainted with RCP/M and CBBS, but the only versions
I've ever seen ran on CP/M 2.2 systems... are there MP/M versions?

Seems a shame, really... can run a quite adequate BBS with a 10 meg
drive.

I just purchased a Xerox 820-II with 8'inch disk drive and internal hard
drive. The hard drive has a few programs on it but after trying the reconfigure
program without any manuals i changed something i shouldnt have, resulting in
not being able to access the hard drive anymore. Its not that the drive is
nuked or anything, i just need a dos disk - If anyone has a boot-able system
disk for this machine PLEASE by all means leave me e-mail! Im sure i can 
work out a means of payment. 
 
Driving me crazy! I can't use the bloddy machine.. help?

Dear Keith:

Thank you for forwarding the letter from Mr. Braatane
(Dag Henrik Braatane, DBRAATAN@NORUNIT.BITNET).  Please
send him this reply:

----------
Like all aspects of operating Bradford, changing the command
character is explained in the manual, which you obtain when you
send in the $25 registration fee.  To change the command
character, put the following command at the beginning of your
document:  .DCC@    This will change the command character to
be the atsign symbol.  If you prefer, use .dcc! or .dcc~ or
whatever character you want as the command character.

               MEX-Plus Terminal Emulation Information
                 The New Z-Systems: NZ-COM and Z3PLUS

Subject: MEX-Plus Terminal Emulation Information

There have been a number of requests for information about MEX-Plus and its
terminal emulation capability.  The following is offered to answer what
questions I can at this point.  I do not use the emulation on my CP/M
machines, so I cannot offer comments from first-hand experience.  Even on my
Compaq 386, I use the emulation only in its simplest form (i.e., not talking
to programs that expect to see a real VT100 terminal).
 
I finally located a copy of the MEX manual with the pages on the emulation
package.  It is a combined manual (CP/M and IBM-PC), so I cannot be sure at
this point that all of the features are supported in the CP/M version.
 
Here is what the manual says about the DEC VT52/100 emulator (taken from
manual -- I don't even understand what all these things mean).
 
----------
 
The VT52/100 emulator supports the following features of the DEC VT100
terminal:
 
    VT52 support       Cursor Up          Cursor Down        Cursor Left
    Cursor Right       Cursor Position    Cursor Read        Newline
    Char Insert        Char Delete        Line Insert        Line Delete
    Reverse Screen     Scrolling Region   "Origin" Mode      Auto-Wrap
    Cursor Pos.        Index              Reverse Index      Next-Line
    Horiz. Tabs        Erase Line         Device Status      Dev. Attributes
    Identify Term.     Report Cursor Pos.
 
        Save/restore cursor and attributes
        Select graphics dendition (bold/blink/reverse vid/underline)
        Clear screen: full, start-screen-to-cursor, cursor-to-end
        Clear line: full, start-line-to-cursor, cursor-to-end
        Alternate character sets (excluding VT100 optional ROMs)
 
Not supported are the answerback message, smooth-scroll, 132-column mode,
printer functions, terminal self-tests, and keyboard LED's (although all the
escape sequences associated with these functions are accepted).
 
Version 1 of the VT100 emulator does not support any interactive setup; this
will likely be added in a future release.  Also, the numeric keypad keys
function only in "numeric" mode; "alternate" mode is not supported.
 
----------
 
The manual also lists the escape sequences transmitted by some of the
special keys on the IBM PC keyboard.  I have not reproduced that information
here.
 
Unfortunately, because the manual is geared toward IBM PCs, it does not list
the functions that must be supported by the host terminal.  From some of the
functions listed, it would appear that beyond the ordinary ones, there
must be support for insert and delete line and probably insert and delete
character.
 
If anyone is seriously interested in acquiring MEX-Plus with the terminal
emulation packages, I will do some experiments or inquire of the author (Ron
Fowler, who used to read this newsletter but appears no longer to be
active).

Subject: The New Z-Systems: NZ-COM and Z3PLUS

   The following item is submitted in response to a number of inquiries
I have received over the net.
 
   Joe Wright, Bridger Mitchell, and I have just completed NZ-COM and
Z3PLUS, new versions of the Z-System that are automatic, universal, and
dynamic.  NZ-COM runs on CP/M-2.2 computers; Z3PLUS runs on CP/M-Plus
computers.  NZ-COM does run on Apple CP/M cards.
 
   They are automatic in that no installation is required.  In particular,
no changes have to be made in the BIOS.  There is no need for source code,
editing, assembling, MOVCPM, SYSGEN, or DDT.  The Z-System can be removed at
any time by issuing a command that reinstates the user's underlying CP/M
system.  Joe Wright invented the basic technique with his Z3-DOT-COM and Z-
COM products several years ago.  Bridger Mitchell has (hooray!) extended the
technique to CP/M-Plus systems, and many very substantial enhancements have
been added.
 
   The new systems are universal in that system modules can be provided in a
file format that can be used on any system with memory allocated for that
module.  Bridger Mitchell invented a new relocatable file format which we
call ZRL, for Z-system ReLocatable.  It is based on the seldom-used named
common facility supported in advanced assemblers.  For example, the new
command processor, ZCPR34, can be supplied as a small, binary file (e.g.,
ZCPR34.ZRL) that can be loaded into any CP/M-2.2-based Z-System, no matter
how its memory is configured (Z3PLUS has an equivalent command processor). 
There is no longer a need to assemble from source code with a Z3BASE.LIB
file configured to describe the user's particular system.  The same is true
for RCPs, FCPs, DOSs, and other code modules.
 
   My contribution to the effort (besides the version 3.4 command processor)
was to make the operating systems dynamic.  It is no longer necessary to
make a static, once-and-for-all trade-off between Z-System features and
program memory space.  The operating system is now more like an application
program -- it can be changed at any time, even right in the middle of a
multiple command line.  It can be changed manually or automatically under
the control of aliases that use the Z-System flow control facility.
 
   Now you can allocate memory (1.5K typically) for an IOP (input/output
package) only when you are actually using an IOP.  When a memory-hungry
application program is to be run, you can drop the two largest buffers, the
RCP and IOP, which usually take 3.5K of memory.  If you need still more
room, you can drop the NDR and FCP.  You can make a minimum Z-System that
takes only 1.0K and still provides its most important features.  If your
application requires absolutely every available byte of memory, you can drop
back to CP/M.  Using SUBMIT, even this process can be automated!  The Z-
System can disappear, an application can run under standard CP/M, and the Z-
System can be reestablished, all automatically as a result of a single user
command!  You never even know that Z-System was gone.
 
   With NZ-COM's system definition utility MKZCM (MaKe Z-Com) you can define
the sizes of the following modules: CCP, DOS, BIOS, IOP, RCP (resident
command package), FCP (flow command package), NDR (named directory
register), shell stack, and an all-purpose user buffer.  The latter can be
used for "above-BIOS" items like DateStamper, BYE, special drivers, and so
on.  In the case of the shell stack, you can define both the size and number
of stack entries supported.  And, by the way, that was not a misprint above
-- you can define systems with nonstandard CCP, DOS, and BIOS sizes.  This
allows for some rather interesting experiments and configurations.  Z3PLUS
allows similar capabilities.
 
   You can now have several versions of command processor or DOS and load a
new one with a simple command.  NZCOM is supplied with four significant
variants of the command processor; Z3PLUS includes two versions, one of
which puts the time in the prompt.  Similarly, with NZ-COM you can switch
between ZRDOS (supplied with NZ-COM) and other versions of the DOS now (or
soon) available, such as P2DOS, Z80DOS, ZSDOS, and ZDDOS.  (Z3PLUS uses the
CP/M-Plus DOS.)
 
   Each product includes an extensive manual (more than 70 pages in 'IBM'
format binder, written by me and Bridger Mitchell) covering the particular
product and Z-System in general.  There are many examples and hints.  Each
product is priced at $69.95 for the standard version including the necessary
operating system files and a minimum set of Z utilities.  NZ-COM is offered
in a version with some sources (including the source to ZCPR34) at $99.95. 
Eventually there will probably be some higher priced versions that include a
more extensive set of Z utilities on diskette.  For those who have access to
Z-Nodes, Royal Oak, or Simtel20, there will be no need to spend the extra
money on these versions.  For those who for some unusual reason cannot use
NZ-COM (or for the stubborn who insist on an inferior, manually installed
system), the source to ZCPR34 is available separately at $49.95.
 
   For those who have not heard, Joe Wright's Alpha Systems has taken over
the marketing of Z-System from Echelon, which is essentially out of
business.  Orders for the new products can be placed with any of the
following sources:

Subject: Osborne I comm programs(?)

This is a plea for help from anyone with knowledge of the Osborne I and
it's communications ports.  A co-worker has one of these machines and
needs to use it as a simple dumb-terminal.  The machine has a serial
port that is connected to an Osborne internal modem, but we have been
unable to make the modem work with the version of Kermit for the Osborne.

1) Does anyone know the dialing commands for the Osborne internal modem?

2) Is there other PD/Shareware communications software that will work on
   an Osborne?

3) Are there any good sources for information on Osborne questions?

Forgive me if these questions are a bit broad.  My experience with CP/M
machines is limited to a DEC Rainbow.  That means I usually give up
on any question I can't answer myself, since the manufacturer has
declared its product officially dead! :-)

Thanks in advance,

Hopped on Royal Oak the other day and to my surprise there's an APL
for Z-80s using CP/M-80.  Has anybody played with it ?

You really need an APL terminal to use it, shifting in and out to
the APL character set. Has anybody ROMed or softwared an APL
terminal for an Apple //e, Xerox 820, or NEC 8500 ?  I have an
APL terminal program for my Commodore-64 but that's only 40
columns (I snarfed it from CompuServe).  I don't have a IBM-PC or
clone yet but if APL things can be had for that beast I'd be 
interested in that too.

I know you can buy APLs for the Atari 520/1040, Amiga, Mac, and
PCs... but I'm just interested in playing terminal to use the
Z-80 one.

Thanks,

   Marty Zimmerman asked about information and communications programs for      
the Osborne-1.  The First Osborne Group (FOG) has an extensive network of       
bulletin board systems that support Osborne computers.  The Boston Computer     
Society has an Osborne Group, now merging along with my CP/M Group into the

but I could get them if you are interested (I don't know where you are

   There certainly are versions of MDM740, IMP, and MEX114 communication        
programs with overlays for the Osborne.  If you have access to SIMTEL20,        
you can get any of them.  I am not sure what complications are introduced

Hi 'Microemacs' - people,
I found in the PD:<MISC.MICROEMACS> library at the Simtel20 archive 57
ASCII entries for the MICROEMACS program and 1 BINARY file "ME1040.PRG".
On what machine runs the above PRG - file and is the rest the sources

direct access to the Simtel20 archive I have to use the File Server
at RPICICGE in BITNET which accepts only a few requests per day, user
and host.

Has anybody in netland yet ordered the above stuff and perhaps made an
ARC - or LBR - file to compress the whole (in the archive there are
as already mentioned only ASCII - files; that's to big to order) ?
If so could she/he then post it to me ?

I would be glad if somebody could anwer me for the above theme.

Subject: MEX-Plus

   Perhaps I should have said it clearly in my previous message, but MEX-Plus   
is the commercial (non-public-domain) version of MEX.  It costs $59.95 from     
NiteOwl Software or its dealers.  With MEX-Pack, which includes the terminal    
emulation modules and a module for remote operation, the price is $99.95.       
The main differences that I can think of now between MEX114 and MEX-Plus        
(version 1.65B) are: much more extensive scripting capability, support for      
YMODEM batch and 1K-block protocols, support for Kermit and Compuserve          
protocols, fancier video displays.

have WORDSTAR files on them. I need to get these files
onto a system I can use (unix based if possible). My drives
are broken. Is there a way to transfer something like this to
a unix system. Can it be done without the machine itself.

Thanks for any info.

Subject: SIGM missing from the Bitnet file server

Through some as yet unknown program bug, the directory list for SIGM has
vanished from the file server at RPICICGE.BITNET.  At present, all requests
for SIGM files or directory lists receive the cryptic reponse "Cannot seem
to find SIGM".  The condition is temporary; as soon as a new copy of the
SIGM file list can be fetched from Simtel20, service will be restored.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

            Micro Cornucopia SOG VII Technical Conference

	MICRO CORNUCOPIA  SOG VII, TECHNICAL CONFERENCE
	JULY 14-16			   BEND, OREGON

SOG (the Semi-Official Get-Together) is Micro Cornucopia's annual
conference for the hardware and software designers who need to
get away from their benches and into the Oregon Cascades.

This is the place where leading edge technical folks can relax,
let the chips fall where they may, and join discussions that carry
through to dawn.

Thursday has always meant white water rafting on the Deschutes
River followed by a western cookout. This year, you've got a choice
for Thursday. We're also offering a full-day, hands on introduction
to desktop publishing (includes lunch and the western cookout).

Friday and Saturday are filled with information. Speakers from through-
out the U.S. (and the world) bring their expertise to the podiums
at Central Oregon Community College (COCC). From 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.
we're offering a wide selection of topics. After 5, of course,
the talk gets serious and the serious get talking.

Saturday evening's the final event and it's always been great fodder
for discussion. Jim Warren, founder of the West Coast Computer
Faire, will be here to stir up our ideas of computers.

So join Jim, and Microsoft, and Oregon Software, and Intel, and
Logitech, and, well, everyone else and help us continue our trad-
itionally non-traditional technical forum.

		ABOUT BEND

We hold SOG in Bend beacuse Bend is a great place to hold things.
The campus looks out across national forest to the Three Sisters.
We've got lakes, quiet mountain streams, some of the most famous
fly fishing waters in the country, internationally known rock climbing,
Lava Caves National Depressions, the Pine Mountain Observatory,
and real wilderness only 20 minutes away.

In fact, when iot comes down to it, the reason why many attendees
return year after year (and bring spouses or special others) might
just be the beauty of the area. That's why Micro Cornucopia is
here. Really.

I have a friend who obtained a used Kaypro with no documentation, same-same
the NEC Spinwriter.  Can someone share suitable settings for baud rate,
parity, etc. so that the two will talk to each other?  what switch settings
will yield, for example, 1200 baud, 1 stop bit, no parity on the Spinwriter;
and how do we set up the Kaypro to send the char's that way?

*ALSO*, anyone know where documentation for these beasties can be purchased?

Subject: Need info on Osborne-1 power supply?

Once again the Astec power supply in my Osborne 1 has gone south for the
winter without waiting for winter.  Thought I would try to fix it instead 
of shotgunning it this time, but I have no information, schematics, etc.
I would appreciate if someone could mail me a print, or tell me where to
get one.  

Also, I recall an article (in FOGHORN?) identifying the cause of
frequent power supply failures, but I can't find it in my limited
resources.  If anyone can help me I would appreciate it.  Thanks.

I bought a non-functioning Osborne I at a garage sale. Where

This one works as far as showing the initial prompt. However,
it flickers badly if the keyboard is attached, and will not
boot. Clarence Wilkerson

EP (Epson print) is a runoff printer formatter which formats and
prints texts using proportionally spaced fonts of characters on an
Epson MX-80, FX-80, and probably on other Epson-compatible printers.
EP's formatting is controlled by commands which are placed in the
text.  Many fonts are supplied (around 50), and you can design your
own.  The characters of a single font can be modified by being
italicized, underlined, emphasized, enlarged, compressed, etc.

Executables, documents, fonts, a font editor, and BDS-C source code
are included with this distribution.

Many thanks to the author, Greg Lee, for submitting it to our
archives; to Bill Swan for converting it to 9-track tape to get it
to us; and to Frank Wancho for loading the tapes on SIMTEL20.

WADE is an interactive symbolic Z80 debugger with full assembly and
disassembly using standard ZILOG mnemonics.  Up to eight conditional
and/or unconditional breakpoints plus a temporary breakpoint may be
defined.  Full tracing with or without list and with real-time
execution of subroutines on command or automatic is provided.  Tracing
may be controlled by instruction count or a conditional expression.  A
full set of operators provides for arithmetic, logical, shift, and
relational operations on hex, decimal, binary, and character data, and
on registers, variables, and symbols, including embedded assignments
to registers and variables.

For those unable to access SIMTEL20 because of network restrictions,
please remember that MOST of the new files announced to Info-Cpm are
also available on my RCP/M Royal Oak (MI) which may be accessed at
300 bps (Bell 103a), 1200 bps (Bell 212a), 2400 bps (V.22 bis), or
9600 bps (HST).  The telephone number is (313) 759-6569 (now reachable
on PC Pursuit at 2400 bps).  They are also available from the CP/M
RoundTable on General Electric Information Services' GEnie.

The directories on my RCP/M have been recently reorganized.  The MAP

Subject: Quest for a PASCAL Compiler?

Has anybody out there ever met the Danish PolyPascal (alias COMPAS)
Compiler for CP/M-80?

I have the CP/M-86 and MS-DOS versions. The doc explicitly quotes a CP/M-80
version, operationally identical. I found the 8086 versions to be an unusual
tool.

The manufacturer does not answer mail, almost certainly out of business.
Furthermore the 8086 MS-DOS version is available in network public domain
software servers.

Can anybody help me find that Compiler?

I failed to answer directly (e-mail gates barriers).

Why not use the excellent, complete, reliable, well-documented, Microsoft
FORTRAN-80 Library ? The guide gives all details required to interface to
any language. It has 7 digits (single prec) or 16 (double) and all trigon.
and transcendant functions.
I use it a lot with the compiler, get same results as on our IBM3081 and
VAX785.

Subject: The Organizer

Is someone out there who has experience with the "The Organizer" by
Tim McNeal ?  It is a PD program from Simtel20, which keeps track of
all your files in one big data file.
I've got a problem to get this program going:
   By startup of the program it prompts the user for how many disks
he is using; so far so good.
   The program finds the data file 'Organize.dat' in drive A; telling
me he is initializing something and then after a few seconds it is
thanking me for using the ORGANIZER and quits.
   What is going on ?

   Allthough I carefully followed the instructions...
   Maybe one remark: I think the author means with 'BIOS.SYS' file
after a SYSGEN must be on disk, that it must be a bootable disk...
   One last remark: It seems to me that Tim wrote the Organizer
in Turbo Pascal ?  It is extremely pitty he didn't included the
source code.

Also, in another, unrelated article, someone asks for hardware info on
the osborne 1...

Amazingly enough, the Osborne 1 is one of the few computers for which
you can get a Sams (r) Photofact (r) 'thingie'.  Complete schematics!

Go look in your local public library for this little gem.  The Phoenix
public library in Phx Az (not much use to you, probably.:-) had a complete
set of Sams Photofact (r).  If you are really lucky, your local library
will too.

Good luck.  BTW, did you put any sort of spike protection on the power
supply?  I put 2 or 3 MOVs inside the case, and never had any problems.

Also, I assume you know about the jumper which will make the serial
port be 600/2400 baud instead of 300/1200?  I mounted a switch on the
case so I could easily switch between 300/1200/2400 (who needs 600, 
anyway? :-)

Sam's Photo-Facts now has a spinoff  called Sam's Computer Facts which
give complete schematics,   test  point    voltages, etc.   Most  real
electronics stores (like where  a  TV repairman or  Ham operator might
shop)  carry bunches of these  and can order any  they don't  have.  I
have a hazy memory of a note that Radio Shack now also carries them.

Yes, I know Sam's  has one for the  O-1.   Sorry I can't give  you the
specific number.  I think it cost $10-15.

Subject: Mod7 or Kermit for Xerox 16/8

I have a Xerox 820-I.  It is my understanding that the Xerox 820-II
uses the same I/O ports as the 820-I.  I believe that the Xerox 16/8
is really an enhanced version of the 820-II, therefore, Modem7 or
Kermit for the 820-II (or 820-I) should run on your 16/8.  I have
both Modem7 and IMP for my 820-I.  I would be glad to make a copy
for you if you want it.  If you have any technical docs for your
16/8 check to see if the following specs match your machine.

	Xerox 820-I Specs for Comm port:

	Comm Chip - Z-80 SIO-0
	Baud rate chip - 8116
	
	Port 0-3  -  Chan. A Baud rate
	Port 4    -  SIO Chan. A Data
	Port 5    -  SIO Chan. B Data
	Port 6    -  SIO Chan. A Control
	Port 7    -  SIO Chan. B Control
	Port C-F  -  Chan. B Baud Rate

If these specs match the 16/8, and I think they do, then my version
should work on your machine.  Mine is configured to use Channel A,
but it can also be configured to use Channel B (Z-80 assembler required).

Let me know if you want it, and I'll try to get it out to you.  If you
reply to this msg, it may be a while before I respond again.  I am
usually on this network only once or twice each week.

Subject: Small C wanted

Hello there netland !

What I am looking for is the Small C compiler from the Dr. Dobbs

I know that I can get the book and start typing but I want to be able to 
program with the package before I am too old to remember to turn this thing on
I know about the Simtel20 archives but I have heard of the stink that has arisen
about the popularity of the mail server so I dont want to get in the middle
of that.  If some kind soul would e-mail the sources in whole or in peices
to conserve netwidth I would be very greatful. 

I will use a Plexis P/75 that runs System V.2 with some Berkley throun in
to compile the first version.  After that I will download to a 
Televideo 802H running CP/M 2.2 as a target machine.  This has a Z-80 cpu
so if you happen to have the opcode tables for a Z-80 please send them
also.

I know that I should really come into the real world and stop using this
antuiqe but this is a step up from the dumb terminal that I was using (it
was borrowed) but this machine runs and was free, two things I look for 
in a system.

Please e-mail me first so that I can verify the mail path and not 
get a gazillion copies that waste bandwidth.

Thank you very much in advance.

Need help with ZCPR33!

I am using a Tandy Model 4 at home, for which I tried to install ZCPR33.
I followed the steps in the ZCPR3 manual by Richard Conn, modified the BIOS,
made room for the ZCPR3 buffers and initialized them. The system would boot up
normally and everything was fine. After assembling ZCPR33.Z80 I was unable to
write the new system to the system tracks with SYSGEN and the computer locked
up. Then I tried to save ZCPR33.HEX to a COM-file with MLOAD and put it on the
system record directly with a small program. ZCPR33 then booted correctly, but
most of the utilities did not run, although they were properly installed.
This is true for LDR, also. Since I knew the addresses of the ZCPR33 buffers,
I could instead load the system segments via GET, which was built into the CCP.
Now ZCPR33 is working and runs ALIASES. But still most of the utilities won't.
Surprise! When I run the utilities from ZSID, they work fine!

What went wrong?

Thanks in advance, Ruediger.

I thought their was a place called Lanngley-St.Clair that sold

perhaps you could just replace the monitor instead of going

From: "Jacques J. Goldberg" <PHR00JG%TECHNION.BITNET@CUNYVM.CUNY.EDU>
Subject: My request for a lead to Polydata COMPAS (Z-80)

Two of you have answered, proposing to give me Polydata's new address.
I replied privately following the e-mailer reply path shown: the NORDITA
mailer rejected the mail. I tried an alternate, got no reply from you:
Ole Lennert and/or Kristian Damm Jensen, THANK YOU FOR ANSWERING.
Please write me the address of Polydata; if easy for you, please PHONE
them, ask if COMPAS-80 still available and at what cost (I can read just
about any CPM/80 5in1/4 diskette.)

Bill Pechter quoted that COMPAS and Turbo-Pascal could have some family
relationship. I confirm, comparing MSDOS-COMPAS with TurboPascal-3.00!
When two compilers produce the same expected result, there is no proof
that they have anything in common, but when both produce the same UNEXPECTED
result, there MAY be something in common...

Try this with your Pascal system [taken from a Pascal course semestrial test,
where probably the author of the question, what does it do, hadn't tried out..]

program tryit(input,output);
procedure readwrite;
var nextchar:char;
begin
  read(nextchar); if nextchar <> ' ' then readwrite; write(nextchar);
end;
begin
writeln('Type in a sweet word, end with one space');
readwrite
end.

What does it do?
The intention is, store the word typed until a space is met, then write
it reversed, preceded by a space.
In fact, it does not work on any of the machines I tried.
Usually ( Unix, VAX-VMS, IBM-PASCALVS, Waterloo-Pascal, Microsoft PASCAL
under MS-DOS), it works Ok but only after the input string is followed
by a carriage return (that is, writing does NOT start as soon as the
terminating space is typed - systemwise, this makes sense, by the way).
TurboPascal and COMPAS produce only the first character of the original
string, that is, that one which should have been shown last.
