I am looking for information on coprocessor boards for various computers.
Please send me info on any boards you know of, computer they are for,
price, operating systems, comments, etc.

An example would be the Sritek 68K board for the IBM-PC.  The board
plus Xenix costs about $2000.00.

I am hopping that this will generate a lot of responses.  If at all
possible, please send directly to me and I will summerize to the net.
Thanx in advance for you time.

Does anyone know of a program which will reformat the hard disk in the

shutdown program and blew a track . I called Kaypro's hotline for help
and they said "...your right. You blew a track on the disk.". The only
problem is they don't have, or they won't sell, the program to reformat
the drive. They suggest I take it to a dealer and pay them to reformat
it. Theres has to be a better way. Any suggestions would be welcomed.

THIS HAS HAPPENED TO ME SEVERAL TIMES. I use XAMN.COM. Use the
I command to find the track, then use C to change and reformat by
entering E5's then use the W command to write and be sure to then
use F (forward) at least 4 times to make sure it really writes.

Subject:  Re:  what is modem7??

Sean - Both MODEM7 and UMODEM use the same basic protocol, originally designed
by Ward Christensen and commonly known as the Christensen Protocol.  However,
the original protocol used a checksum method of verifying the accuracy of each
128-byte block sent, whereas updated implementations of the protocol ALSO allow
the option of using a more complex (but more capable) cyclic redundancy code,
or CRC, checking scheme.  MODEM7 is a step in the evolution of Christensen
Protocol programs.  An offshoot is the MDM7xx series of programs.  The 
particular program you have may or may not be the actual variant known as 
MODEM7, and it may or may not allow CRC checking.  In any case, UMODEM does NOT
do CRC checking, so will not work with your program in that mode.  If your
program defaults to CRC mode, it may eventually switch to checksum mode after
some number of failed attempts to transfer the first block.  Depending upon how
long it takes for the switch to occur, UMODEM may time-out and quit.

     I suggest you try this:  First verify that UMODEM is more-or-less working
by giving it the command (from a terminal) to send a file.  Assuming that
UMODEM starts up and displays messages that say it is going to send so-and-so
file of such-and-such length and so on, then YOU play the role of the receiving
program (still using your terminal).  Send UMODEM a control-U (which is the
ASCII "NAK" character), and if it is working, UMODEM will send the first block.
If you get the first block on your screen, send another control-U.  This will
tell UMODEM that you have received the block in error, and that UMODEM should
resend that block.  You should get it again on your screen.  You should be able
to repeat this until you reach UMODEM's error count limit, at which time UMODEM
should abort and return you to your host's operating system (i.e., UNIX).  On
the other hand, if you answer a UMODEM transmitted block with a control-F
(which is the ASCII "ACK" character), UMODEM should send the NEXT block.  You
can play around to your heart's content this way, until you are satisfied that
UMODEM is (or isn't) working.  Because of control-structure changes between
BSD 4.1 and 4.2 UNIX, changes to UMODEM are required to make it work on 4.2.
Be sure yours is working.

     If you find that UMODEM is working, then make certain that your "MODEM7"
is operating in checksum (not CRC) mode.  I have not personally used the real
MODEM7 (which you may or may not have), so I know nothing about the command
set or help facility (if it has one).  Perhaps someone else will comment on
that.  Does your program work okay in terminal-mode?  Are you connected 
directly to the UNIX computer?  Your program may not tolerate the delays of a
packet-switching network between you and the UNIX machine.  Are you operating
over an 8-bit path?  Although UMODEM has an optional 7-bit mode, your program
almost certainly does not.  The original Christensen Protocol requires an
8-bit path because of the way block numbers are encoded for error checking.
It won't work over a 7-bit path.  UMODEM should be putting the UNIX machine
in 8-bit "raw" mode.  You can check this by turning on the UMODEM parameter 
display mode with a "p" in the command line.  For example, you might use

	umodem -stp filename.

It is a good idea to have a printing terminal when you do this, as the output
is rather voluminous.  Good luck.

John,

One of the systems you mentioned considering was the Morrow Decision.  Do you
mean the big Decision I (S100 buss Z80 model) or the MicroDecision with the
single motherboard?

I've owned the Decision I for 1 1/2 years now (but not with additional
memory - mine's the single-user 64KB version), and can give you feedback on
what it's like to live with the Toad (as I fondly call it).  I have the
model with a nice fast 5 Megger Winchester and 8" floppy disk drive.
Have NOT, repeat, NOT gotten the necessary fixes from my Morrow vendor (they
said only a new EPROM was needed) to replace the supplied North Star hard
sector 5 1/4" floppy drivers/controller with soft-sector - so still dead in
the water there.  Have NOT, rpt, NOT gotten any guarantees from anyone that
I can easily add more memory.  Documentation SAYS the Toad can switch back
and forth, but no one's guaranteed it yet!  So donno if you can pack in a
nice banked memory.

Have NOT tried a RAM Disk yet, though recent articles (especially one in
Dr. Dobbs latest) seem encouraging that it'll be a drop-in fit.

Hope this is useful.  Get back to me if in fact you mean the Decision I,
and I can say more.

Personally, if I were buying today and wanted power, flexibility, upgrade,
"kind-of" IBM PC family compatibility/similarity, plus access to all the
wonders of CP/M Public Domain, etc. -- I'd buy the Zenith Z100/120/etc
family - maybe the nice one with the 10 Meg hard disk.  If you're a Govt
employee, Government Employees Association (GEA) has such a deal!
And the software costs (Condor, Lotus 123, etc.) are very cheap.  And the
documentation is great!

Plus - who can argue with $20,000,000 worth of systems in the Navy/USAF
plus other colleges pumping out Public Domain goodies?

David Kirschbaum

	Good machines:
	Kaypro, as entry level and cheapest.
	Compupro S-100 as experimental, state of art development
system, as well as darned good "just use it".  They will have
3rd quarter ths year an s-100 IBM Video board, and concurrent
Cp/M alrady runs  IBM PC DOS within it (the whole mess was
working at COMDEX, and with a 2-86 yet, which board will be
available now and useful in about a year.)
	Portable 8-bit Otrona is nice.  The New IBM Otrona is
not bad either.
	We are very happy with the Z-100
	The Z-150 is VERy IBM Compatible; Peter set ours up
today and booted it with an IBM disk right out of the box.
	The TI Professional is a bit nicer than the IBM PC but
not so compatible as the Z-150 (but more so than the TI
Professional.)
	All are pretty good machines.  In part what you get
shuld depend on your service capabilities: who gonna maintain it
and what does the maintainer like?

A friend of mine (not on the net) tells me a curious story:  He was having
problems with his ALS CP/M card occasionally freezing.  He called ALS, and
they told him to look in location C1 of his Apple IIe and see what chip was
there.  According to the Apple specs, it should be a 74S109, but sometimes
Apple uses a 74F109.  Some subtle difference between the two causes the
problem, and putting in a 74S109 solves it.

Has anybody else run into this?  I'm not an engineer, so I don't really
appreciate the differences between the various flavors of 74x109.

The KayPro X is a good buy, with plenty of software.  It runs pretty
fast, both processing and I/O.  It'll never be an IBM PC--the add-on
boards for it only make it a "sorta" MS-DOS machine.  It ain't
as expandable as (say) an S-100/IEE-696 type machine.  It is available
at many locations.  KayPro only acts in its own enlightened
self-interest, so its machines aren't always as reliable as they might
be.  Their hard-disk problems seem to be a thing of the past.


The Morrow MD11 (11 meg storage) has a good reputation.  It's not as
available as the KP10.  Its software offerings aren't as popular.  It's
not designed to be a true portable, though its size lends itself to
that.  Does anyone know if they use plated-media drives?  The MD11's
portability is limited upon the terminal you choose.

Don't know the 4000, so I won't say anything.

The QX-10 still suffers from severe speed problems, enow.  This is
partially due to the 1/2-high Epson drives, which have a 15 msec
track-to-track step rate.  This is three times slower than good drives.
Valdocs doesn't help this; their CP/M keyboard (there are two) is an
"ASCII" layout, like the APPLE II or ASR-33's.  Valdocs is infuriatingly
slow, despite the Rising Star efforts to speed it up.  The QX-10 doesn't
come with much software besides this.  It's not too bad in the
portability department, so long as you have a safe place for the
screen--but it takes two carries to move it.

I like the Zenith Z-100 (though it's more expensive than the above three
in its assembled (and comparable configuration) state).  If you can
solder at all, the Heath H-100 is a great deal and takes only about 10
hours to build.  H/Z offer some good software deals for it.  It can take
8" and 5-1/4" drives.  (someone offers an 8" disk adapter for the
KayPros.)  It's not really portable; it's a little heavier than the
QX-10.  Hard disk option ain't too cheap.  It has a 5-slot
S-100/IEEE-696 bus in its back for expandability.  It'll run CP/M-80,
-86, and MS-DOS 1.1 and 2.0.  Its user group is very active.

Mind you, *my* computer is a CCS Z80 S100 system with dual 8" drives, so
I know how hard it can be to move a computer (groan).

Subject: New CPM Version?
Article-I.D.: intelca.285

With the advent of MEX and Modem7xx and any number of communications
programs. Combined with the neat features of ZCPR it seems it is about
time for a new version of "standard" CP/M, say CP/M 2.3. I suggest we
add some new jumps to the BIOS for communications hardware. Specifically
	MDMIN  - Modem In, read character from modem into A
	MDMOUT - Modem Out, write character in C to Modem
	MDMST  - Modem Status, Returns 0/FF in A is modem is ready to send
		 or has recieved a character (C=0 for input status, 1 for
		 output status)

Have DRI update the BDOS, (ie fix any bugs) and maybe add some system calls
for accessing the communications port. And voila CP/M 2.3. All in 64K so 
everyone can use it, maybe using banks as a BIOS option.

Subject: Wordstar Files (decoding)
Article-I.D.: intelca.284

I have several documentation files that are in "Wordstar" format, but
I do not have Wordstar! Since I have no desire to buy WS just to print
these files out, I wondered if anyone knows of a program that implements
just the formatting part . I have a copy of FILTER, which I used on the
files, that made them into straight ASCII text. However it can either remove
"dot" commands or leave them in, not execute them. Since it would be nice 
to get page breaks, and Headers and Footers, and Boldface and underline
I need something that will do just that. Any pointers would be appreciated,
even some documentation on what the WS commands do would be nice. If
there are any replies I will summarize.

be replacing the drives every year.  Also, any good recommendations on

Workman & Assoc. has ten Siemens 8" SS drives in action.  We've had a
bad time with DOAs, but once we found drives that worked, they always
worked.  Don't know about the DS ones.

The Siemens drives are a little slower than yon Qumes.  We've had even
less trouble with Qumes.

With the price of Siemens drives, one of our peeps bought a spare drive.
Priority One's $99 price is only $25 more than official service price.

W&A also sells spare parts kits for the Siemens SS drives.  This
includes belts, index assemblies, etc..  We've had much less call for
them than the Tandon 5-1/4" drive kits (of which we have sold
hundreds).  Of course, Tandons have the famous door latch problem.

A warning on Mitsubishi 8" drives.  They ain't standard.  CompuPro, CCS,
and several other systems upchuck when you attempt to use them.  There
are differences in the precompensation settings & other things.  This is
why Priority One no longer sells them.

Chuck (et al),
When I hacked my Decision I CBIOS, I implemented a serial port as a modem port.
Just kind of duplicated what the console calls do, and tried calls to RDR and
PUN - worked fine!  Donno why new calls are needed provided you have source
for your own BIOS.

Agreed, many systems do NOT have such a wealth of information about their
own innards, and then you're kind of stuck with a disassembly (tried that
on a Franklin Ace 1200 the other night with IOBYTE implemented, some tricky
memory switching, etc. - ugh!  Never DID find port addresses!).

Of course, if you have an IOBYTE switching things around, you can do other
fancy calls and do things with a modem too.

Just a comment - not too familiar with other systems and their strengths/
weaknesses - and I never mind more built-in functions ... SO LONG as they
don't bloat things even bigger than they already are!  Those BDOS fiddlings
slow things down enough as it is - that's why I use direct CBIOS calls so
much.

David Kirschbaum

John

I have a pair, and 3 close friends have a pair each, for a total of 8
drives in my realm of experience. Of these, 6 work (and have worked)
perfectly from day 1; the other 2 are in the third pass of "send back
to JDR for new drives". 

I note the following things about them: 

(1) they are very speed sensitive; if you don't step at exactly 6ms you
    are very effectively dead
(2) they are quite (when mounted horizontally)
(3) the damned doors don't shut unless there is a disk in the drive
(4) the AC connector that they use in NOT the standard connector used
    by every other 8 inch drive I've ever seen. Be very sure that you
    tell the person you order the enclosure from that you are getting
    Seimens drives and that you get the correct connector. Making your
    own is a pain.....
(5) there is a problem in multi-sector writes under MS-DOS; if you 
    write the last sector on the back side of a track and need to move
    to the first sector on the front side of the next track, it hangs
    if you try to do it conventionally (you have to seek to current
    track, then step in. Sigh....)
(6) for the price, you can't beat them; buy 3 -- use 2 and save one as
    a backup

These are all FD200-8 drives, have been in service since January. The
repeated failure is on an IBM PC with Maynard 8" controller. Recent
MS-DOS BIOS hacking to rectify the problems in multi-sector writes
indicates that the problem is problably software screwing up otherwise
good hardware.

I've had good luck with two North Star Advantage computers.
They have been reasonably reliable, they have good graphics and
CPM implementation (including a GOOD assembly-language interface with the
graphics), and a really solid keyboard.  The things I've
not liked: no software support (the manuals are good, but
there aren't any listings of the BIOS and North Star doesn't
want to hear from you), and hard sectored disks (unlike the rest
of the world).
On the other hand, I have to admit that the Z-100 is a better
computer, and will run any CP/M programs that don't require
a Z-80. Check the prices.

I find it interesting that someone would find a Fairchild F series chip
in an Apple. F series is faster than S (1ns gate delay, typical), and
uses less power. It is considerably more susceptable to noise, however.

Since F is more expensive and harder to get than S, I can't understand
why you'ld see F used. However, it might explain the problems he was having.

     USING AZTEC C WITH THE MICROSOFT OPTION AND THE SOFTLIBC.LIB 
CREATED  FOR THAT OPTION WITH MICROSOFT "LIB"  YIELDS  REL  FILES 
THAT TEND TO HANG UP MICROSOFT "L80".   AFTER  ONE  FILE  IS

SOFTLIBC.LIB is probably in the Aztec format (.LIB extension!). Normally there
should be a library with the .REL extension, which is in Microsoft REL format.
Try to use that one. If you don't have such a library try to contact Manx because
creating the library in .REL format does require some fancy work.

Subject:   The latest info on the BBS confiscation case
ReSent-From: KPETERSEN@Simtel20.ARPA
ReSent-To: Info-Cpm@Amsaa.ARPA
ReSent-Date: Mon 4 Jun 1984 12:24-MDT

On Saturday, June 2, there was a meeting of Los Angeles area
sysops to find out the truth behind the confiscation of the
Mog-Ur BBS. The Sysop of the Mog-Ur BBS was there along with
his lawyer. Here is a report on what I learned at the meeting:


The messages (there were two of them) containing the AT&T
calling card numbers were left on his board using an option to
leave an anonymous message. The Sysop can tell who leaves such
messages, but the general public can't. Another feature of his
BBS software is that you can specify the length of time (in
days) that a message should stay up. The messages in question
were left with a very small number of days and Tom (the sysop)
never got to see them before the system automagically killed
them.

During the time the messages were on, a Pacific Bell agent
called in and saw them. PacBell asked the police to get a
search warrent for Tom's computer. This is standard procedure
when PacTel finds a BBS handing out phone phreak information.
No effort was made to ask Tom to delete the messages or find
out who left them.

Either somehow Tom found out that PacBell was going to show up
or they allowed him to do the work while they were there, but
Tom searched his disk to find the information on the offending
messages (now killed) and got the name of the person who left
the messages. He provided this information to the police.

The police confiscated Tom's computer, not to find out who left
the messages, but to give Tom a hard time. It is a standard
PacBell procedure to have computers confiscated when they are
used to run whacker BBS's. The idea is to use terror to keep
sysops in line. It didn't matter that Tom had provided them
with the name of the person who left it, they were going to
take his computer (which with many hardware goodies, including
a hard disk, is worth over $10k).

The police have charged Tom with conspiracy (which they change
you with when they can't find anything else that will stick),
and under a law that makes it illegal to provide credit card
numbers with the intent to defraud.

Tom has retained a lawyer who thinks the whole thing will be
thrown out and is going to try to make PacBell look bad.
If it ever goes to court he says all he has to do is get a jury
of normal people (i.e. no PacBell employees) and present it as
a case of John Doe vs. the phone company. Nobody likes the
phone company. The lawyer has documented cases where this
kind of information was left for weeks on UCLA computers and
on CompuServe (I assume in BULLET), and the police did
nothing (its easy to pick on a small computer sysop, but trying
to confiscate UCLA or CompuSevre is harder).

InfoWorld reporter Peggy Watt was on the scene and a story will
run on the front page of the next issue about it. If there is
any difference between my story and the one in InfoWorld,
believe InfoWorld. I have tried to get this correct, but Peggy
talked with Tom and his lawyer a lot longer than I did, and she
took written notes (this is from memory).

PacBell has refused to talk to Peggy, and the LAPD person who
conducted the raid is on vacation. When the superior of the
detective was asked about it, the reply was like "You mean we
confiscated $10,000 worth of computers? I didn't know that!".

It was reported earlier that Tom had a section on his BBS
called "Underground" where these kinds of messages were posted
before. I have found out it was his policy to delete any such
messages when he saw them. The idea behind the section was not
to rip off the phone company, but to discuss "things you
wouldn't want just anybody to read" (Tom's system didn't
require validation to use, except for the underground section
which you had to ask for access to). Another idea was to
provide a place to leave unpopular opinions since it had the
ability to leave anonymous messages. I hope this clears up what
this section was meant for.


Thats all for now. The lawyer is pressing for something to be
decided during the next week. I will keep the net posted.

To:  INFO-CPM@BRL.ARPA
Message-ID:  <840604234435.548547@HIS-PHOENIX-MULTICS.ARPA>

In the CP/M-80 implementation of Turbo Pascal, the examples given in the
manual for processing the CP/M command line DON'T WORK.

Consider:

procedure foo;
var cmdline : string [127] absolute $80;
begin
WriteLn (cmdline)
end.

This works correctly for commands up to 32 bytes in length.  Beyond
that, the command line is filled with rubbish by the time the user
program gets control.  Seems the Borland folk use that space for a jump
table and some other miscellaneous material.  They know about the bug --
"we're working on it."

It doesn't look as if it would be too difficult to patch a generated COM
file to grab the command line at initialization time and stash it
somewhere safe.  I may try that one of these times, if they don't come
up with a fix quickly.

My opinion of Turbo just dropped about three notches [to very good, from
superb :-) ].

Note that this is just the 8-bit version; the 16-bit versions can use
``absolute CSeg:$80'' and it works just fine.

Subject:  ZCPR3 Status

        The release of ZCPR3, which was scheduled for the end  of
May,  should  occur sometime within the next few days.  There are
just a couple of  minor  points  to  clear  up  and  some  online
documentation  to bring up to date.  SIG/M (and, I think, the San
Diego Computer Society) has sent me some disks which I'm  waiting
on  now, and I already have disks for SIMTEL20 and Echelon.  I'll
post another message to the group when the disks actually go out.

        Sorry for the delay, but I guess the delay of a  week  or
so  is  tolerable.  When the release occurs, complete source code
to everything will be included, and  most  of  the  documentation
will  be  in the form of HLP files.  One manual, the installation
manual, will be included as well.  After  this,  in  about  three
months, a book on ZCPR3 should come out, providing tons of detail
to those who wish to write their own  utilities,  find  out  more
about  the system, and have a nice hardcopy of the documentation.
Note that the HELPPR (HELP PRint) utility, which is provided with
ZCPR3  at  the initial release, will provide you with an easy way
to print all the HLP files if you wish.

        For those of you familiar with and using ZCPR2,  I  think
you  will  like  ZCPR3 very much.  I personally can't stand to go
back to ZCPR2 any more, being adicted  to  the  new  features  of
ZCPR3.  Also, as a pleasant note, all of the ZCPR2 utilities have
been converted to ZCPR3, and the average utility, performing  the
same  or  more  functions, is 60% smaller under ZCPR3 than it was
under ZCPR2.  About the  only  thing  that  did  not  shrink  was
VFILER.

        Chat later when the release occurs.

                Rick

    I recently used the MXO-KP23.ASM overlay for my Kaypro II,

    be an improvement, except that the DSC command no longer
    works.

    Did I overlook anything?

MXO-KP23.ASM has been replaced by MXO-KP25.ASM.  Several bugs have
been fixed, including the one you mentioned, I believe.  It's in

To: info-hams@simtel20.arpa, info-cpm@brl.arpa

This message announces the availability of a new batch of files in
the SIMTEL20 archive. The complete package makes up a Mailbox
and Bulletin Board system for Packet Radio, and a subset of the
files are useful for any Xerox 820 owner.

The files are in the directory MICRO:<CPM.PACKET>.
The list of files and their CRCs follows. Here is a very
brief summary:

The files XRXP*.* are a commented disassembly of the version 2
boot PROMs for the Xerox 820.

The XBOOT.* and XSBIOS.* files are the bootstrap block and a BIOS
for a CP/M or CP/M-clone system for the Xerox 820. [The CP/M
itself is not included in this package, being copyrighted.
It can be any standard 60K system, the CCP starts at D400.]

The remaining files are a bulletin board system for use with a
Packet Radio station using a TAPR TNC. It can be used for simply
talking to your TNC and sending/receiving files, if you don't
want to become a packet SYSOP.

This Mailbox is currently running at W0RLI, K1BC and K1OJH,
all here in Boston on 145.01.

Start with the READ.ME and the FILES.TNC files to see if you are
interested in the Mailbox, and see also the XRXP.DOC file for
notes on the 820 PROMs.

The PROM disassembly is my work, but the rest is the work of
Hank Oredson, W0RLI. He is not on either ARPANET or Usenet,
so I am posting these for him. I will relay comments and
questions to him. You call also reach him by US Mail at his
address which is in some of the files (TNC.ASM, for one).

And finally, thanks to Keith Petersen for helping me through some
cockpit errors and software recalcitrance in getting the files
uploaded to the net.

Does anyone know of a CP/M 80 emulator that runs under CP/M 86?  The idea is
to transition from an 8-bit to a 16-bit environment without having to cut
over all programs cold turkey.

I'd appreciate any input, pro & con, and any suggestions as to who I might
contact to locate such a beast.  Thanks.

Subject: MODEM730 & KAYPRO: can't print to Epson
Article-I.D.: noscvax.506

Help!
  I'm using MODEM730 on a Kaypro 4 (old, purchased Oct. 83) with a 300 baud
modem, and an Epson MX80 printer with GrafTrax running through the serial
port.
  The MODEM730 was derived from M7KP-1.ASM and installed to know about
the Hayes Smartmodem (even though I'm not running from one). I created the
COM file from SIMTEL20's HEX file, and installed by using DDT.
  My host is a VAX 11/780 running 4.2bsd Unix.

********* the problem *********
  When I select ^P to toggle the Epson online, subsequent lines are losing
characters both on the screen and at the printer. It looks like usually the
missing characters are at the left part of the lines.
  When I toggle the printer off, characters stop disappearing.

  What have I done wrong? I also saw this behavior in earlier versions of
MODEM7, so I don't think the problem is a new one.

  Any ideas?   Thanks in advance!

Subject: MDM7xx and MODM700 progress
In-reply-to: Msg of 5 Jun 1984  20:06-MDT from David Towson (CSD) <towson at Amsaa.ARPA>

Thanks for the note, Dave.  MODM700 will replace MDM7xx because
MODM700 is the next update.  It is the same program, but with a
different name because Irv Hoff has copyrighted the MDM7xx name and
claims that no one but he is "authorized" to make updates.  When he
released MDM740 without source code and announced that source would no
longer be available, it was the "last straw" because there are others
with excellent ideas for improvements and they have been unable to add
them because Irv rejected the ideas for one reason of another.

I agree, he has made significant improvements, but it's time for the
program to return to the public domain.  Here's a progress report on
MODM700 - it looks great!

From: Robert L. Plouffe
To:   Keith Petersen
Re:   MODM700 progress

MODM700 is alive and well.  Nearly finished.

New features are:

1. Wild cards (*) in file names, as well as multiple file names (in send),
automatically place the transfer protocol into batch mode.  Can still use
'B' option but is not necessary.

2. Uses Carrier Detect lead on modem to do various things...

       a. Avoid re-initializing modem and port to default speed
       if carrier is already ON when executing the program -- so
       you can go out to cp/m and then back to MODM700 without
       affecting your modem parameter settings.

       b. Reset modified modem command prompt if carrier is off.
       See 3 below for modified command prompt.

3. The end that dials a connection and gets connected has its
command line prompt modified to say "Enter LOCAL Command" instead
of just "Enter Command".  Thus you can always tell which end is
giving you the command prompt as you proceed and switch between
Command mode and Terminal mode

4.  Any command that can be executed from the Modem command line
can also be executed from the CP/M command line by entering the
command after the program name.  This includes dialing a number
or a library ID.

5.  Length of dialing command from either the CP/M command line
or the Modem command line is no longer restricted to 3 letters.
You can now use 'C', 'CALL', 'CAL', or 'DIAL'.  Also the position
of the command and the number  (either one or both) is no longer
critical on the command line within the limits normally imposed
by CP/M.

6.  The above freedom for other commands and their command tails
(if any) also apply.

7.  New command parser that avoids 'INLNCOMP' routine.  Scans
legal commands first and then looks for legal options (which
are retained from previous versions). This procedure avoids the
'RESTART' sequence to catch primary options. Many synonyms for
commands are allowed such as the example above for dialing. The
list also includes 'SEND', 'RCV', `RECEIVE', 'STAT', 'SAVE',
'CAPTURE', etc, etc...

8. The modem-end that initiates the connection returns to Terminal
mode automatically after a file transfer, and the other end returns
to Command mode.  No need for 'T' on the command line for this to happen.

9.  Automatic disconnect of phone line in batch mode if more than 3
attempts to receive or send a file name upon detection of file name
errors or timeouts.  You can now safely go to bed and let it run to
completion without worrying if it will crash and keep your long-distance
connection up if file name errors occur. The 'D' option already provides
for disconnect upon completion or if too many errors on sector sending
or receiving.

10.  Extensive clean-up of messages to operator in batch mode. No more
nonsense like 'Awaiting name NAK'.  Now sends the message 'Sending file
name' instead, which is actually what is going on and more meaningful
to the user. This is only an example and there are others. Like, says
'File name received' instead of 'Awaiting file name' and does it only
when the file name is received.  This avoids the extra 'Awaiting file
name' message at the end of file transfers in batch. Ditto was done for
the messaging in sending of file names also.

11. You can toggle between 'Q'uiet mode and verbose-reporting during
file transfers by entering a control-V at the keyboard.  Thus if you
are using the 'V'iew option for either S, R or both to see characters
being transferred (including protocol characters), this useful toggle
will prevent the 'verbose-reporting' from interfering and confusing
the viewing on the screen.  Alternatively, it can be used simply to
toggle 'Q' mode on and off even if not in the 'V' mode.

12.  All of the syntax of MODEM7xx, MDM7xx etc that derive from the
original MODEM2/MODEM7 is retained in addition to the new commands
and syntax options.

13.    Last but not least, the program does not build a table of
file names any more for sending in batch mode.  It searches (next)
for files specified both as wild cards and as individual file names
(including their drive designation) for all name specifications
entered on the modem command line.  This will continue indefinitely
until no more files can be found from the file name specifications.
Thus, the program is NO LONGER limited to just 64 files in batch. 
You may enter as many file name specifications (including wild-carded
ones as well as ones with different Drive designations) as the command
line will handle  -128 characters, same as cp/m command line

Does anyone really want the batch calling of phone numbers that is in
MDM740?  I haven't looked at that yet but it should be easy to do if
anyone is really interested.  I don't care for it myself.

Well, that is about it,  -and all I can recall for the moment, except
for several clean-ups and removal of little 'hacks' that didn't do any-
thing. This effort will result in returning the source code for MODEM7
in its latest revised and improved state back to the "public-domain"
where it rightfully belongs.

Steve (et al)

The Wang PCs we procured here at Fort Bragg do have a CP/M-80 emulator,
but it's quite proprietary and I don't think it would likely run on
anything but a Wang PC.

It works fair - so long as it's pure "vanilla" CP/M programs that don't use
any fancy tricks (donno how to define fancy tricks, but it darned sure
can't find ports, peeks or pokes into the guts of the CCP/BDOS, etc.).

Sorry, no other information.

Subject:  S-100 IBM PC graphic boards

I have heard of two S-100 boards that are supposed to emulate the IBM PC
graphics "standard". One, a CompuPro board, was supposed to be exhibited at 
Comdex. Did anyone actually see this board? I understand that the Lomas board
more imminent, perhaps a month away from appearing on dealers' shelves,
and that there will be two versions, the lower cost one being strictly
IBM PC compatible, the fancy one offering a mode with twice the resolution
as well. The Lomas boards will supposedly have a keyboard port for a
Keytroncs (IBM) keyboard, and net single piece cost for the lower cost
version (discounted, not list) is on the order of $300.

Can anyone shed any more light on this subject? Assuming one installs
such a beast in an 8088-based S-100 system, what good is it if one
is not running MSDOS or PCDOS? The other obvious question is whether
there will be any provision to transfer software from PC disks to 8"
or other 5" formats. At first blush it sounds like an interesting idea,
but without CCPM with PCMODE, I am not clear what if anything such
a board will buy me. Any thoughts would be welcome.

Subject: Octagon CP/M 80 BIOS bug
To: info-cpm@BRL.ARPA


This message refers to a bug in the OCTAGON hard disk attach BIOS for
CP/M-80 that sometimes causes the internal disk buffers to get lost on
program exits.

I called Dr. Goodman at Octagon (he wrote the bios) and described our
problem to him.  I had guessed what the problem was, but since we run
a highly modified bios, I wasn't sure if the bug was in our code or
his.  I asked Dr. Goodman to look into it and read him a short basic
program that one of my employees, Al Fallone, wrote to demonstrate
the problem.

10 OPEN a random access file
20 FIELD a string in it
30 LSET the string to "OLD"
40 PUT the string to the file
50 CLOSE the file
60 OPEN the file again
70 FIELD the file the same way as in 20
80 LSET the string to "NEW"
90 PUT the string to the file
100 CLOSE the file again
110 SYSTEM

The bug causes the file to end up with the word "OLD" in it.  the
change to the word "NEW" never gets written.

Dr. Goodman called back at 7:47pm.  Here is the beginning
of our conversation:

Dr G: Hello.
Me: Hello.

Dr G: Guess what?
Me: What.

Dr G: Its a bug.
Me: No kidding.

Rutgers - 2		Octagon- 0

Dr Goodman said that putting a call to FLUSHBUF right after the label
HDwboot (warmboot) in the file HD.ASM will fix the problem.  I added
it. Then I used the submit file to generate a new HD.COM.  Guess what?
It works.

Dr. Goodman went on to say that the 8086 version of the bios does not
have this bug.  So you 16 bitters out there needn't worry.

1. The CompuPro S-100 PC video board was designed by Tony
Pietsch, and a wire-wrap was demonstrated at COMDEX.  Faster'n
hell, color and high-res on same board, steady, said to be 100%
PC compatible down to Flight Simulat or although I have NOT seen
FS run on it.

2. I hAve had telephone conversations with Lomas, who promised
to send me some literature and a letter; the idea is to get some
of ths stuff out here to Chaos Manor.  The day after I talked to
him, his secretary called to ask my address again.
	That was at least thre weeks ago (I'd have to look in
the log to be sure exact date) and since then I have heard
NOTHING.  The editors at BYTE asked me to talk to this guy, and
I certainly would be glad to, but so far the results have not
benn encouaraging. I dunno if (1) they got mad at me, (2) the
Post Awful lost their stuff, (3) their shipping dept never sent
whatever it was, (4) they don't have anytyhing to ship, (5) none
of the above.
	Anyone who is in contact with Lomas might tell them I
still have heard nothing.

3. The CompuPro board was running under Concurrent CP/M with the
PC DOS emulator (not emulator, exaclty) module.  Worked fine,
and could do other jobs.

Thanks for the reply... any word on release dates for either the graphics board
or CCPM with PCMODE? Since I have heard that the Compupro version will be
little different from DRI's OEM release, there should be little holdup on
its release (unless of course the DRI release is buggy, and that would
not be all that amazing, would it?)
For your information, Gifford will be releasing their own version of CCPM 8-16
in the not too distant future; it will be an upgrade from their MP/M 8-16
and will probably look pretty similar at the user interface level. They
have been making lots of happy sounds about their implementation of
DR's SoftNet (Arcnet) and have approximately 15 Compupro and IBM systems
tied together. I may finally have a good enough reason to purchase
an IBM PC!

Subject: SWEEP40 file copy program available on SIMTEL20

SWEEP version 4.0 by Robert Fisher is now available on SIMTEL20.  This
utility program is for maintaining file directories, and transferring
files between drivers and user areas under CP/M 2.2.  When SWEEP is
invoked, you will see a menu of commands and the first entry in the
directory.  You will also be given a total space (in K) occupied by
the files and the remaining space on the disk.  Typing 'space' or
'return' moves you forward in the directory; typing B moves you
backward.  The directory is circular, so typing space at the end of
the directory moves you to the beginning.

This program was written in PL/I and the complied .COM file is 28k,
which is much larger than NSWP or DISK7.  However, SWEEP40 has been
around for a long time and there have been no bugs reported.  I have
received two reports of NSWP205 trashing hard disk directories.

SWINIT is a setup program which allows you to customize SWEEP40 for
your terminal's screen clear command, maximum number of drives
allowed, maximum user number allowed, etc.

No .DOC file is needed because the program has built-in help and
because SWINIT allows customization which was formerly documented in a
.DOC file and required DDT to patch.

Here is a list of the files (the .HEX files are for those who cannot
FTP binary files):

Filename			Type	 Bytes	 Sectors     CRC

Directory MICRO:<CPM.FILCPY>
SWEEP40.COM.1			COM	 28032  219 =  DBH  0599H
SWEEP40.HEX.1			ASCII	 68232  534 = 216H  7549H
SWEEP40.TXT.1			ASCII	   249    2 =   2H  EE98H
SWINIT40.COM.1			COM	 13952  109 =  6DH  D80BH
SWINIT40.HEX.1			ASCII	 33975  266 = 10AH  41A7H

I don't beleive that anyone has mentioned the fact that it is possible
to verify users messages before unleashing them onto the board. CBBS
(Ward & Andy's program) supports this feature. I'm not advocating this
as I'm sure there are types of boards in the USA which are better
totally open.

An interesting fact over here in the United Kingdom is that the
telephone company must approve the modem and the use of the line for
Data comms. We have yet to enter this sort of dimension, as the boards
here tend to be of a technical, or, for sale nature.

I sincerely hope that Tom can get his system back very soon

I have extensively used a couple of Big Board II systems over the last
6 monsths.  The general specs for this single board computer are:

A 4Mhz Z80, 64k RAM, 1 SIO, 2 CTCs, 1 DMA channel, CRT controller,
SASI interface, STD bus, 256k RAM piggy back option, 6 EPROM slots.

For the most part this is a really nice computer.  Some very good
engineering.  For example the ports may be configured as DTEs or DCEs
by moving some jumper blocks.  The CP/M CBIOS is the fastest I have
seen anywhere (that runs in 64k).  You can get a hard disk system up
for a very reasonable price using this as a base (I did).  I have had
only minor reliability problems which are more than offset by the very
reliable CBIOS.  A EPROM programmer program is available.

If you are interested in nit picking...  There were a few screw ups...
The system cannot drive 5.25 and 8" disks at the same time.  There is
a minor design error in the write precompensation circuit (most other
disk controllers also have this problem).  The distributors, Cal-Tex
Computers, is a garage operation.  Which is not to say that they are
dishonest (I believe that they are very honest).  But they might not
be around in a year or two.  Oh yea, do NOT ask Bill Siegman (the
owner) anything other than yes/no/how-much questions..  He will talk
your head off about the silliest subjects.

If you have any questions -- ask (me..  Not Cal-Tex..  See above).

Cc: edelheit@Mitre.ARPA

We've got a ROLM PABX that we're also using as a digital switch.  (It's
the newest model, not one of the older ones that had some really bad
problems.)  Anyway, we have had it now for about one month and have 
found that it has a couple of no-cost additional features such as:

	1.  Dropping your session without the least warning.  Under this
	    scenario, your host session gets dropped, you recall the 
	    host and can re-login.

	2.  Dropping your session without the least warning but when
	    you manually reconnect, it puts you into someone else's
	    session without you having to login!  As you are going 
	    into a LAN, you can find yourself in any number of 
	    different hosts.  (It's interesting to find yourself in
	    the middle of your Dept. Head or Division Head's PROFs
	    acct.)  When you log-off of the "bad" acct. and try
	    to login on your own acct., and if the system will not
	    allow multiple concurrent accesses under the same
	    user id (a la IBM VM/CMS) you can't get in unless the
	    person who may now have your session logs-off or your
	    you call the machine operator and request that you get
	    forced off.

All-in-all, I think the ROLM stinks.  Worse yet, I think I am stuck with it
for at least 2 more years.  I am sort of curious if any other Netlanders
have had ane experiences with this wonderful device.  I'll summarize all 
responses and post them for those who might be interested.

Thanks in advance,

I have owned a Big Board for some 3 years now and it has given me no
trouble at all since I put the thing together.  I recommend it highly.
The price of a kit is under $300 if memory serves me, and you can buy
the bare board if you have a source for parts. (nothing too exoitic on
the BB, just LS and TTL).  Also some good add on boards available for
double density, RAM Disk, etc. Also a decent magazine (micro Cornucopia)
for ideas and support.

The Ferguson Big Board, sometimes refered to the Big Board II, is a
neat little machine. It has all of the features mentioned, plus a 
SCSI interface that will talk to a Xebec hard disk host adapter and
then a hard disk. The BIOS supposedly supports it already, I don't 
know of anyone running a hard disk on one though. The Video is neat
and you can use it as is or write your own emulator for your particular
terminal. All in all a neat system. The FBB can be purchased from
Halted Specialties Corp in Sunnyvale A&T for $545 their # is 
(408) 732-1573. It does not come with CP/M but they sell CP/M 2.2
for $150. You can also get the bare board and ROM set (Monitor, Character
generator) for $245.

Take a bit of advice..  Quit nickel and dime(ing) when it comes to the
purchase of computer equipment..  A Big Board is a good deal because
something similar (but configured) is going to cost at least $1000
more, but the difference between a $400 and $800 dollar terminal is
the difference between junk and quality.  I highly recommend either a
Heathkit H-29 (kit) or Zenith Z-29 (assembled).  If you locate a 10%
discount coupon from Heathkit you can get the H-29 for ~$600.  It will
take you aprox 30 hrs to build.  I don't know of a better terminal
around for the money (anyone else have an opinion?).

As for the cost of a Big Board system:

Big Board II		$600	(Cal-Tex unkit, assembled ~$800)
Power Supply		$200	(Ferguson UPS 5-200)
Case			$200	(tricky to find a good one)
3 Siemans FD100-8s	$400	(Priority 1, 2 production + 1 spare)
Monitor			$150	(I have seen them for $25-$60 w/o case)
Keyboard		$125	(Jameco, not recommended but only 1 I know)
-or- H-29		$650
XEBEC			$350	(Kieruff or $425 from Priority 1)
5 meg ST-506		$500	(seen them for as low as $300)
Misc + Cables		$200
CP/M w/ CBIOS		$150	(Cal-Tex)
Micro Cornucopia	$15	(A must for serious BB hackers)
256k Memory board	$50	(Ferguson, only for hardware hackers)
3 sets of 8 64k chips	$200	(CompuAdd sells 9@$59 w/ 1 yr warranty)

Check Micro Corn, Microsystems or Computer Shopper for BB ads.  There
are plenty of ways to cut the above cost even further (e.g., get a
cheaper linear power supply as opposed to the switcher listed above;
build your own case; shop around for misc bargains in Computer
Shopper).  Moral: Substitue back work for bucks.  The more back the
less bucks.  John Otken.

-- GENERAL CASE...
I don't think that there is an easy way out. I would recommend writing 
three subroutines.
 1 - PORT INSTAT - Check Port Data Received (RxRDY) status. 
 2 - PORT IN - If PORT INSTAT is ready then INput the character.
 3 - PORT OUT - Check Port Data Ready to Send (TxRDY) status, if it is 
     not ready, loop, else OUTput the character.

These routines are not difficult to write, and once you write it, you can 
call them as many times as you like. 

-- ALTERNATIVE ...
If you are very lucky to have the BIOS implementor of your system implement the
I/O byte, such that the system checks the I/O byte location before it does I/O
operation, AND the port you wish can be specified as logical CP/M device (see
STAT documentation), then all you have to do is poke a value into location 3.
The INPUT, INKEY and PRINT will work on the set port.

Good advice, and especially good detail on what it takes with the Big Board
to get up and running.

However...terminals.  I've been running a Freedom 100 terminal since they
first came out (cost about $490 or so then), and have had absolutely NO
problems!  Fast scrolling (normally run at 19200 from my Decision I serial
port), a BUNCH of commands, almost exactly like a Televideo 925.

The original Freedom 100 had a kind of non-glamorous keyboard -- works just
great, don't get me wrong, but doesn't look quite so sexy.

Oh, yeah - by the time I got a printer to try the Auxiliary serial port
off the back of the Freedom, I was out of warranty, and have never managed
to get that port working for Screen Print, etc.  Bad luck, I guess.

The new Freedom 110s (I think) are even nicer - sexy keyboard, PLUS
true programmable function keys (my 100 had the same keys, but NOT
software programmable).


One good looking machine, and advertised retail at only about $525 in Byte
and elsewhere.  I don't know if it's emulating a Televideo 950 or higher in
its normal mode or not; suspect so.  Manual isn't so bad either, though not
like a DEC terminal manual.  Just takes a little figuring and playing.

Hope this helps.

     I'm reluctant to start in on terminal discussions on info-cpm
(isn't there already an info-terms or something?) ... but...  We've
got a Qume QVT-102, which is pretty nice.  It's emulates about 4
other terminals as well as having its own mode (the Televideo 910
mode is the most useful), and it sells somewhere in the neighborhood
of $550.  Priority One carried them at one time, and may still; I don't
have a current catalog.

	If portability is a major concern I think your best bet will be
the Kaypro-10.  The only drawback I know of is the screen size.
	The Morrow MD-11 has more cables (the computer & drives residing
in one box & the terminal being an off-the-shelf ASCII RS232 variety),
but the screen is full-sized.  The hard disk is (obviously) an 11Mbyte
model.  The present terminal (MDT-60) is a little brain damaged (the 
cursor arrow keys send capitol letters) but that hopefully will be
resolved in the future.

How can Irv Hoffman copyright the mdm7xx programs. As I understand
it the latest mdm740 is based upon the original work of Ward
Christensen. Is Hoffman going to split his profits with Ward??
Also, how did Irv Hoffman get sole possension of the source code to
mdm7xx??
I for one, will not buy Hoffman's version of mdm7xx even though I have
been using the mdm7xx programs for years.
BTW, if anyone has the source to mdm740 and wishes it translated to
the Zilog mnemonics then I have a program called makez80 which does
the translation.(A little plug for my program,he he he).

	Heres to hoping that public domain programs remain public.

Is this possible?

Subject: CP/M text editors, Turbo Pascal
Article-I.D.: ittral.424

[real sites don't eat lines]

Several weeks ago I posted a request for information on good CP/M text
editors. I was interested mostly in public domain stuff, but asked for
info on commercially available editors as well.

Twenty-six people responded. Out of these twenty six people, twenty-four
said "TURBO Pascal! A good text editor and a great Pascal compiler, too."

So I bought it. And it really is a great package. For about 50 bucks you
get a really nice editor and Pascal compiler. The text editor has a 
command structure similar to MicroPro's WordStar; I had no trouble 
adapting to it, even though I'd never used WordStar before. So the text
editor comes highly recommended. But wait, there's more...

The Pascal compiler alone is easily worth the price of the package. I'm
using an Apple //e with a Z-80 card, and I would venture to say that
for the money TURBO Pascal is one of the best Pascal compilers available
for the Apple. It compiles down to Z-80 code (compared with Apple Pascal,
which compiles to interpreted p-code), and compiles and runs very fast.
Here are some comparisons:

Sieve benchmark (1 iteration):    Apple Pascal --- 52 seconds
                                  TURBO Pascal ---  5 seconds

Empty loops (1,000,000 times):    Apple Pascal --- 600 seconds
                                  TURBO Pascal ---  46 seconds

Given that Apple Pascal is p-code, the above figures aren't all that
surprising, but many's the time I've wished for a faster Pascal than
Apple Pascal; now I have it. Very compatible, too. I have moved about
20 programs over from Apple Pascal to TURBO, usually with only minor
changes necessary, sometimes none at all.

TURBO Pascal allows the compiled code to be placed on disk (in a .COM
file) or directly into memory where it may be executed immediately. In
both cases the compilation is quite fast, much faster than Apple Pascal.
TURBO also allows overlays.

Well, that's about it. I'm quite impressed with the package. It's one of
the few pieces of software I've bought that I really feel was worth the
money. By the way, I don't mean to start a debate over Apple Pascal and
Turbo Pascal, as they both have their places and I still use them both.
Apple Pascal was the only Pascal compiler I had to compare with.

I'd be interested in comments from other TURBO users.

Ted,

I tried FINDBAD, a CP/M public domain program available on one of the
SIG/M disks and also available via FTP from SIMTEL20 (can get you specific
pointerss if interested).

It seems to work OK on floppies (though sometimes it doesn't find ALL the
bad tracks - don't know why!), but never tried it on my hard disk (a Morrow-
provided 5-Megger with my Decision I) -- scared, I guess!  My hard disk
formatting program seems to do a pretty good job of locating bad sectors -
at least it never found any, and I never get a bad sector error!  However
that formatting program is proprietary, so I can't give it to you.  I THINK
there was an older Morrow hard disk formatting program also at SIMTEL20,
but don't have the pointers right here and don't remember the details
(I looked at it out of curiosity but had no need for it).

Sorry I can't be of more use,but maybe this'll point you toward something
useful.

Keith,
I'd be most interested in a download of that Dr Dobbs text editor you
typed in -- but what's a "shar archive"?  Does that mean I can FTP it
from somewhere?  Or you can maybe mail it to me (in chunks - IF it doesn't
overload your/my mailer or Usenet)?

Sorry, checked all over, but couldn't find any paper heavy enough to
make a twenty-pound note! Considered pasting a regular letter to a cement
block, but couldn't quite see the purpose in it!  Hope this weightless
electronic mail will suffice!

Subject: File Transfers thru a TAC
Cc: key%marlin@Nosc.ARPA

I  am  trying to transfer a text file from a Kaypro 4  through  a 
MILNET  TAC (specifically,  the ACCAT-TAC) to VAX-11/780  running 
4.2bsd UNIX.   I am using a MODEM7 variant,  kmdm795, in checksum 
mode  on the Kaypro.   I have used both xmodem and umodem on  the 
VAX side,  in both receive-text and receive-binary mode and  also 
with  the 7-bit mask option (with umodem).   I have tried sending 
both  with  and without "binary input start" and  "binary  output 
start" set on the TAC.   In each instance I receive the following 
error message:  

          Sending #1 (0001H) 
          87H Rec'd, not ACK
          Sending #1 (0001H) 
          87H Rec'd, not ACK 
               .        .
               .        .

until the transfer dies from too many errors.  

Curiously,  if I turn things around and transfer a file from  the 
VAX to the Kaypro using the same software and the same path,  all 
works fine! 

I  have  been using umodem/xmodem and kmdm795 for a long time  to 
transfer  files without problem to/from the same VAX via a  local 
area network.  

Any suggestions?

Gerald,

I suspect you may be having the same problem I am with going through a TAC.
Downloads work fine, upload NO GO!  I suspected the TAC's input buffer was
to blame (heck, I can overrun that just by manual typing when the system
is slow), and someone else out on the net confirmed that.

They also said you can talk with your local TAC wizards about getting the
buffers expanded from their usual size (I THINK 60-some bytes) to 130-some
(whatever MODEM's packet length is) to overcome this problem.

I talked with mine, and they're talking with the Powers That Be, but no
big buffers yet (they're researching possible bad side effects).

I'm stuck too for packetized uploading, and so use KERMIT for all uploads
requiring error-checking.  (KERMIT's packet length can be adjusted, so
I routinely set them for 48 or so -- works fine.)  For other uploads
when the lines are clear, I engage flow control (FIS on my system) so the
TAC give me XON/XOFFs (so as not to overflow its buffers), and upload
right into a text editor -- works fine.  If I want a binary upload,
I use the PD utility UNLOAD to change my binary file back to hex (ASCII),
upload into the text editor, and send it that way for the other end to
LOAD or MLOAD (another PD utility) back to binary.

There's also a problem when uploading through a TAC -- the TAC's Intercept
Character.  I've patched both KERMIT and MDM730 to check each character sent
(in automated, bulk uploads) for the TAC Intercept Char, and if found, to
send it twice. This insures that character gets to the far end and the TAC
doesn't choke.  If you need more details on this, yell.

Hope this helps.

David Kirschbaum

Stephen (et al)

A wise friend on the net gave me some good advice - to ask for any sort of
transfer of that editor from our friend Keith in London would create some
pretty bad phone bills for some of the nets/routers in between.

I didn't really look at the message routing, but going back now -- I gotta
agree!

He also says that editor is "available in the CP/M archives" -- I asked him
for specific pointers (I assume he means SIMTEL20's treasure trove), and
will be glad to pass on to you (et al) when confirmed.

Alternatively, if that is NOT available here -- Keith, I'm presently involved
in another software transfer (all Public Domain, of course) from the UK,
and can link you up with my Old Country contact.  Possibly you could
piggyback that program over with him (though all this now seems like
somewhat of a kludge).

Not wanting to interfere - but just save all some problems and not abuse
this wonderful system we have here...

Gerry;

When using the TAC put it into Binary mode with @B O S and @B I S
to get it through.  You will not be able to give TAC commands afer that.
Also be sure your umodem has the 4.2 changes to it.

Good Luck

I picked this up on the Sysop Clearinghouse RCPM last night.
---

=================================================================
     MEX-EASY.DOC         05/20/84         STEVE SANDERS
=================================================================

So  you  got  MEX10  and can't quite figure out  what  steps  are 
necessary to input the phone numbers and such...

Well,  you are not alone!   I have most of it figured out after a 
week of playing with it and will pass on what little I do know.

ENTRY OF PHONE LIBRARY
======================

From  the  MEX prompt enter "PHONE  id=number", like this:

          [MEX] A0>>phone a=1-555-111-1111

                       or

          [MEX] A0>>phone alan=997-0020

The "id" string may be up to twelve characters or as few as one.

By entering "PHONE" now, the following will be displayed:

          [MEX] A0>>phone

          A       = 1-555-111-1111
          ALAN    = 997-0020

The simplest way to enter a pre-done library is to make up a file 
to be "READ" in by MEX.   Use Wordstar in non-doc mode and edit a 
file called PHONE.PHN, enter the following:

PHONE A=1-555-111-1111
PHONE ALAN=997-0020
PHONE id=numbers
PHONE etc...

Fill in as many as you want up to a maximum of 30 numbers.   Then 
bring up MEX and enter:

          [MEX] A0>>read phone.phn

You  will then see MEX "read" in each of the phone command  lines 
until  it  reaches the end of the phone.phn file.   You  may  now 
check the newly installed phone library by entering:

          [MEX] A0>>phone

To make this new library a permanent part of your MEX,  just  use 
the  CLONE  command now to copy an image of MEX from memory  with 
the library installed:

          [MEX] A0>>clone mex1.com

You will now have a new file called MEX1.COM which will have  the 
phone library already in it.  

WHAT IS  INI.MEX ??
===================

When MEX is first brought up,  it is pre-set to look for the file 
called INI.MEX.  This file contains commands to be READ in to MEX 
when  it  is  first initialized.   This is very  similar  to  the 
STARTUP  command  under  ZCPR2 which also holds  a  multi-command 
statement  to  be executed after a cold  boot.   You  may  create 
INI.MEX  with  Wordstar in non-doc mode and include  any  "legal" 
MEX10 command line.  Such as:

          GLOBAL T;ID "[ MY-MEX ] ";CAL A

The form of the file is:   command;command;command

Each "legal" MEX command MUST BE seperated by semicolons.

This  would make the return to terminal (T) mode default after  a 
file "R"eceive or "S"end operation;  change the ID string to read 
"[ MY-MEX ]"  rather  than "[MEX]";  and automatically  dial  the 
number associated with the id "A".

... Or,  you can  forget  INI.MEX  altogether and  just receive a 
"Can't find INI.MEX" error message on initialization.  Which does 
not hurt anything,  it just indicates that the file is not on the 
current drive/user if SEARCH = 0.


INSTALLING "KEY" STRINGS
========================

Just as MDM7xx has a CTRL-L logon, you can set one up in MEX much 
the same way.   Once in "T"erminal mode,  the only escape back to 
command  state is with a CTRL-J followed by an "E".   A  complete 
menu  of  escape "CTRL-J" functions is seen by entering a  CTRL-J 
followed by a "?" from Terminal mode.

Any other ASCII key character is a "legal" definable key that can 
be  used in Terminal mode for special functions.   To set up  the 
"L" key the same as the logon key in MDM7xx, enter:

          [MEX] A0>>key l="firstname;lastname^M"

NOTE:  The carat "^" indicates a CTRL key and ^M is the same as a 
       carriage return.   It MUST be inside the quote marks  that 
       define the keystring entered.

Now  once  you are connected with the remote system and  wish  to 
send your logon in, simply enter a CTRL-J followed by an "L".

If  you attempt to specify one of the characters that is  already 
used as a Terminal mode command an error is returned.   Also note 
that  MEX will always prompt you with a "Syntax error" message if 
the command you are trying to enter is illegal.

USING THE HELP COMMAND
======================

MEX has an extensive on-line HELP facility if the HELP.MEX is  on 
the  current drive/user along with your MEX.COM file.   From  the 
MEX prompt enter:

          [MEX] A0>>help ?

The  complete  list of help files available is  displayed.   Then 
just enter HELP followed by the command name desired:

          [MEX] A0>>help call

This would list the help info for the auto-dial command CAL


USING THE SENDOUT COMMAND
=========================

The SENDOUT command is used in .MEX files for automatic operation 
of MEX.COM with the remote host system.  The SENDOUT command will 
send a string out the modem port (hence the name  SENDOUT).   You 
can  specify  a  prefix  and a suffix  for  all  SENDOUT  strings 
allowing  real flexibility.   Most commonly used would be a  null 
string for the prefix and a "^M" (carriage return) as the suffix.
The prefix and suffix can be set by INI.MEX at startup or defined 
by  you  after MEX is up and running.   Type HELP PREFIX or  HELP 
SUFFIX for full info on this.

If  you  know the DIRectory of the system you  are  calling,  you 
can build a file like this:

SENDOUT "XMODEM S B5:SD-88.LBR^M";R SD-88.LBR
SENDOUT "XMODEM S B1:MEXNEWS.0Q2^M";R MEXNEWS.0Q2
SENDOUT "XMODEM S A0:RCPM-049.LQT^M";R RCPM-049.LQT
DSC;EXIT

After connecting with the host system,  signing in,  and entering 
the CP/M system - use CTRL-J then E to get to command prompt.
Let's say this file is called AUTO.MEX, use the following:

          [MEX] A0>>read auto.mex

MEX  will now send the commands to the host system to XMODEM  the 
three  files  listed  above  in the  SENDOUT  commands  and  then 
initiates  the "R"eceive mode and save all 3  files.   When  it's 
done,  MEX  will disconnect from the host (DSC),  and exit MEX to 
your CP/M operating system.

I  think  you can see the possibilities here  are  endless.   The 
above  sequence could have been performed UNATTENDED.   This  can 
save  you a lot of $$$ on long distance charges if you know  what 
files you want in advance.

There are many more commands than the ones I have described here, 
but  this should get you started in the  right  direction.   Just 
remember  that  MEX  can be as simple as as  complicated  as  you 
desire.  It is a great program and will get even better.

	Osborne is expected to come out of chapter 11 in the next month or so.
They have been selling overseas as well as in Canada since before chapter 11,
and plan to re open sales in the U.S. by introducing two new microcomputers.  

	The first release will be of a lap-sized micro using a regular CRT,
which is to be bundled with the usual OCC software package.  (CP/M, WordStar,
SuperCalc, MBASIC/CBASIC, etc.).  It is not known, at this time, what the
specifics of it are yet, but it is rumored that it will be upgradeable to be
IBM-PC compatable.

	The second release will be a desk-top/transportable micro, running
MS-DOS.  Though this doesn't sound too exciting, the real news comes when one 
is told of the response of an OCC engeneer when asked if it would have a 68000
processer in it (---AAAH, Maybe!!!).

	
	They will continue to produce the Executive I, and the Executive II, and
they are making some serious considerations for continuation of the production
of the Ozzie 1.

TWIMC,
 
F.Y.I.
 
I have been having problems with large printouts handshaking properly w/
my 630.  Seems as though someone drops one or two characters per 630-buffer.
 
After consultation w/ the folks at Kaypro, the problem has been narrowed down
to a bug in the ROM.  They are sending me V. 1.9E (not e) and CP/M 2.2G, which
they claim solves the problem.
 
We'll see ...

To: INFO-CPM@Mit-Mc.ARPA


   There will be a new release of MODEM7 software w/source
to the public domain.  It is fully tested with a Hayes modem
now and some local testing with PMMI modems is going on this
week.  It will be initially released to the INFO-MODEM7 list
for comment and/or Beta testing, followed by full release in
a few weeks. Work to be done is some documentation, minor clean
up, and testing.  My time is limited so be patient.

The source contains the following info regarding improvements.

 NOTICE:  This is a new fork in the MODEM7 generic series and
 contains many new features and improvements.  See detail below.	
 Especially see the special configuration requirement necessary
 to obtain the features listed in 2 below under New Features.

 The purpose of this effort is to return the source code for MODEM7,
 in its latest revised and improved state, back to the "public-domain"
 where it rightfully belongs.		Bob Plouffe  --June 12, 1984

			************


 New features are:

 1. Wild cards (*) in file names, as well as multiple file names (in send),
 automatically place the transfer protocol into batch mode.  Can still use
 'B' option but is not necessary.

 2. Uses Carrier Detect lead on modem to do various things...

         a. Avoid re-initializing modem and port to default speed
         if carrier is already ON when executing the program -- so
         you can go out to cp/m and then back to MODM700 without
         affecting your modem parameter settings. 

         b. Reset modified modem command prompt if carrier is off.
         See 3 below for modified command prompt.

	 c. Prevents DIAL (CALL) command from working at either end
	 if already connected as indicated by presence of carrier.

	 d.  Allows for compatibility with remote automatic answering
	 software that requires that the Carrier Detect lead in the
	 RS232 interface follow the presence or absence of carrier.

	 NOTE: You must have a routine in your overlay for checking
	 the status of the CARRIER DETECT lead for these three features
	 (a,b & c) to work as advertised. You will need to get to that
	 through a special jump which you must add to the overlay at
	 the label JMP$CHKCD.  The routine in your overlay must return
	 the Z flag set if carrier is absent and NZ if it is on.
	 You may modify any of the M7 overlays to include this jump
	 and routine without affecting their use for MDM7XX. On a Hayes
	 SmartModem set switch 6 to ON or UP in order for Carrier Detect
	 to be active (else it is tied high permanently).  All other
	 switch settings should be the Factory Settings as listed in
	 Table 1 on page 2-6 of the manual. The ORG for JMP$CHKCD is
	 145H, so place a jump to your routine at that location in
	 your overlay.  There are 3 NOP's there now, so just replace
	 them with the JMP. If you have a PMMI modem, the correct routine
	 is already in this source so you won't have to do anything.	

 3. The end that dials a connection and gets connected has its
 command line prompt modified to say "Enter LOCAL Command" instead
 of just "Enter Command".  Thus you can always tell which end is
 giving you the command prompt as you proceed and switch between
 Command mode and Terminal mode.

 4.  Any command that can be executed from the Modem command line
 can also be executed from the CP/M command line by entering the
 command after the program name.  This includes dialing a number
 or a library ID.

 5.  Length of dialing command from either the CP/M command line
 or the Modem command line is no longer restricted to 3 letters.
 You can now use 'C', 'CALL', 'CAL', or 'DIAL'.  Also the position
 of the command and the number  (either one or both) is no longer
 critical on the command line within the limits normally imposed
 by CP/M.

 6.  The above freedom for other commands and their command tails
 (if any) also apply.

 7.  New command interpreter that avoids 'INLNCOMP' routine.
 Scans legal commands first and then looks for legal options (which
 are retained from previous versions). Many synonyms for commands
 are allowed such as the example above for dialing. The list also
 includes 'SEND', 'RCV', `RECEIVE', 'STAT', 'SAVE', 'CAPTURE', etc.

 8. The modem-end that initiates the connection returns to Terminal
 mode automatically after getting connected and/or after file trans-
 fers are completed.  No need for 'T' on the command line for this to
 happen. The other end automatically returns to Command mode.

 9.  Automatic disconnect of phone line in batch mode if more than 3
 attempts to receive or send a file name upon detection of file name
 errors or timeouts.  You can now safely go to bed and let it run to
 completion without worrying if it will crash and keep your long-distance
 connection up if file name errors occur. The 'D' option already provides
 for disconnect upon completion or if too many errors on sector sending
 or receiving.

 10.  Extensive clean-up of messages to operator in batch mode. No more
 nonsense like 'Awaiting name NAK'.  Now sends the message "Waiting..."
 instead and, when the NAK does get received it says "Sending file name"
 which is actually what is going on and more meaningful to the user.
 This is only an example and there are others. Like, it says "File name
 received" instead of "Awaiting file name" and does it only when the file
 name has been received.  This avoids the extra "Awaiting file name"
 message at the end of file transfers in batch. Ditto was done for the
 messaging in sending of file names also.

 11. You can toggle between 'Q'uiet mode and verbose-reporting during
 file transfers by entering a control-V at the keyboard.  Thus if you
 are using the 'V'iew option for either S, R or both to see characters
 being transferred (including protocol characters), this useful toggle
 will prevent the 'verbose-reporting' from interfering and confusing
 the viewing on the screen.  Alternatively, it can be used simply to
 toggle 'Q' mode on and off even if not in the 'V' mode. This toggle
 will work only at the end making a phone connection and not at the
 end that may answer under 'BYE'.

 12.  All of the syntax of MODEM7xx, MDM7xx etc that derive from the
 original MODEM2/MODEM7 is retained in addition to the new commands
 and syntax options.

 13  Last but not least, the program does not build a table of
 file names any more for sending in batch mode.  It searches (next),
 after each file transfer, for files specified BOTH as wild cards and
 as individual file names (including their drive designation) for all
 name specifications entered on the modem command line.  This will
 continue indefinitely until no more files can be found from the file
 name specifications (or until the receiving end exhausts disk space).
 Thus, the program is NO LONGER limited to just 64 files in batch.

It seems criminal that Irv Hoff was able to take mdm7 out of the public
domain, but I haven't followed all the discussions - maybe there was a
good reason.  However, what stops Mr. Hoff, or someone else, from doing
the same with modm700?  There seem to be ways to keep things private
(e.g. copyrights) but how does one keep things public?

Fellow CP/M'ers - I have just received the following message from a reader of

Subject: "personal" mail on info-cpm

Dave,

I may be out of line here, but I don't like having my mailbox cluttered
with "personal" messages, like the recent few asking a fellow for copies
of the text editor from Dr.  Dobbs journal.  People are awfully free
with carbon copies to info-cpm.  If you agree, I wonder if you could put
out a message asking folks to be more considerate of what they put out
net-wide.

Thanks,

     I feel that this is a very reasonable request.  I cannot imagine any 
reason why the general readership would want to know that Joe User is asking
for a copy of some program from an individual source.  That is a private
transaction, and I ask that you do not send copies of such things to the 
whole list of readers.  Not only do such personal matters waste people's time
and computer resources, but they also COST MONEY for our USENET friends, many
of whom have considerable telephone bills resulting from their network
activities.

     Please broadcast only general interest messages, and use limited
addressing for the private stuff.  Thanks.

  Well, I shan't comment on the legality of claiming copyright of
previously published material:  it varies with whether you adhere to the
Berne conventions or not.
  However, copyright can be used to keep a published work available, if
not really in the public domain.
  (1) Claim copyright on your own behalf, and that of the
      previous authors
  (2) Make use of the program contingent on acceptance of a
      contractual obligation
  (3) Make the contract enforce the accessability requirements
      you desire.
  The following is at least close to correct in Canada:

     Copyright (C) 1965, 1967, 1983 XXX.YYY
         A free and unrestricted licence to use, modify and
     distribute this program is granted, subject to acceptance
     of the following requirements:
         That this notice appear unchanged in the program
     source and executable
         That the program be distributed in full source
     to any further recipients, and
         That .... <whatever you want here>.

  This does NOT prevent a person from claiming copyright on extensions,
or refusing to release his copyrighted parts to the public domain.  It
does keep him from from simply claiming that "no-one owned it so I took
it".

Hello,
I have a Sylvania F6T5BL "black light" tube, it gives off
a purpulish glow... It doesnt seem to erase my EPROMS
but is the same kind used in that BYTE article. Could it
be that programming an EPROM several times require longer
erasure times???? or do I have the wrong UV tube?
In any case, the idea of UV light, +25v besides blown
eproms and melted power supplies is making me go toward
the new EEPROM (Seeq and Xicor +5v EEPROM) -- does anyone
know how to order these things from the distributors,
often rude and only cater to orders of 10000's ??
thank very much -Ed

In the United States, anything which has been published without
copyright notice, or published with copyright notice plus
message to effect that it is released into public domain is in
public domain; claims to the contrary are not going to be
enforced by courts and authorities.
	The case where a public domain work is modified and then
copyright is attempted is cloudy.  Take "My Fair Lady": this is
of course drawn from Bernard Shaw's now public domain Pygmalian;
but of course it is also an original work.  When first done
Pygmalian was not public domain, and license fees were paid to
the Shaw estate.  Now the original is PD but My Fair lady
decidedly is not, as you will find if you try to put it on
without obtaining permission.
	Susanna is an opera drawn from the Bible which is
certainly PD; but Susanna is not.
	A copyright is no more than a license to sue (under
certain circumstances); there are supposed criminal penalties
for willfull violation of copyright but in practice these are
seldom applied.

    The L.A. District Attorney declined to file felony charges and 
referred the matter to the City Attorney for determination of a
misdeamenor filing. The indication is that he, too, will decline...
     Meanwhile, the MOG-UR is back up using loaned equment.
Still 24 hours a day, still 300/1200 baud and still supports multiple 
boards.  The number is 818-366-1238.
      InfoworldMagazine has been running a series of articles and editorials 
on the Mog-ur situation and the ramifications to BBSes in general. The
issues of interest are 25,26 and 27. I highly recommend that anyone who
is concerned about or interested in this situation read these issues 
(you can get them at the library if you don't subscribe and can't find 
them at a newsstand).
       Thanks for your assistance and support, everyone!

I have uploaded some updated files to Simtel20. A new version of the
public domain footnote program has been uploaded to <CPM.WSTAR>:

		FTNOTE13.COM
		FTNOTE13.HEX
		FTNOTE13.DOC

Another useful WordStar utility is in <CPM.TXTUTL>:

		UNSOFT1C.C
		UNSOFT1C.COM
		UNSOFT1C.HEX

This is a utility written in BDS C that will take a WordStar document
file and convert it into a non-document file. See the source for
documentation. Note that the complementary program, ENSOFT.COM will
convert a non-documant file into a document file.

I have a couple of programs that would best be distributed by including them
in the archives at SIMTEL20.  If you are interested, please tell me the best
way to get them there.

The first is a C/80 version of the Dr. Dobbs screen editor, which BDS C version
is presently in MICRO:<CPM.EDITOR>.  I have already had several requests for
this but don't have the time or disk storage to respond to all of them.

The other is a RAM disk emulator for CP/M-86.  It has been written using DR's
ASM86 for the NEC APC, but should move easily to other systems by giving
the segment and offset of the BIOS jumptable.

If either or both of these seem of public interest, I can get them on this
ARPAnet account for retrieval.

Since I am new (very new) to cpm 3.0 aka cpm plus I wonder if any of you
with far more experience than I would recommend against using extended
directories.  Would this then make all my 2.2 disks including hard disk
compatible and useableby 3.0?  I don't see very much activity on this
subject and I wonder if there isno interest or if the compatibilty
problems aren't as severe as I imagine them to be.

The only two things that I am aware of (without hitting the books too
hard) is that direct calls to the bios are not supported by 3.0 and that
the directory can look different from 2.2 if so optioned.

I am beginning to have second thoughts about installing 3.0 for those
reasons and "primarily" because I have fallen in love with zcpr2.  Is
there a "real" advantage to 3.0 or not?

Re:   MOG-UR update!!!

I just learned through a phonecall from Tom Tcimpidis, Sysop of the
Mog-ur's San Fernando Valley HBBS that as of today, June 18th, 1984,
that the  L.A. City Attorney declined to file charges of mis-demeanor.
Evidentally it was realized that the case was very questionable for
charges based on the tactics that were used by the complaintants for
revealing the alleged illegal information.  Horray for Tom!

For some interesting reading, see Issues 25, 26, & 27 of Infoworld.

Tom's equipment and media should be returned to him within

Re:   LINKING LONG BASIC PROGRAMS

Sometime ago I placed an inquiry here about problems I was having
linking long basic programs in the 25-29k range. I was getting out of
memory aborts from the link process. I talked to Microsoft customer
support and there only solution was to make the program smaller.  This
was my Oxgate BB program that I had previously linked under version
5.2 of Bascom.  I asked Microsoft if they had any linker products for
sale that would link from disk.  They said NO!! but quite by accident I
found that the linker LD80 supplied with their Cobol package would
work fine. I have used it on large Fortran and Basic programs with
good results.  Why do you suppose Microsoft doesn't know about their
own products?  I hope this info will help someone else struggling
along. Lifeboat didn't know either or were not telling. They offered
to sell me at $350 PLINK.  Oh well Live and learn.

Hello NetLanders -

   I am trying to bring up CPM on my Intel single board computer system.
The cpu board is the Intel iSBC 8612 and the disk controller
is the Intel iSBC 204 (single sided, single density).
Could somebody give me pointer to a vendor, or information on how
to port an existing system to my hardware.

Please reply direct to me so I won't feel guilty about flooding
INFO-CPM with another handware software porting inquiry.
Thank you in advance.

I don't use zcpr, so I can't help you on the disk questions, but
cp/m-3.0 gives you, if I remember correctly, a BDOS call which
will perform the BIOS call you actually want.  (number ~50 or so).
Going from 2.2 to 3.0 was great for me, but the things I hear about
zcpr make me think there'd be little reason to choose 3.0 over
zcpr, unless you wanted to take advantage of bank-switching.

Forwarded from the Sysop RCPM Clearinghouse for information to DJ2D/B
owners.

From: TIM CANNON
To:   DAVE HARDY

Dave,  Well you had the right answer to the problem of the DJ
controller not being able to copy from 1024 byte sectors to 128 byte
sectors. The 1791 was indeed the culprit. The controller that came
with the board was a Fujitsu 8866 and not a 1791. It follows Morrows
habit of using cheaper chips that don't match what's on the schematic.
Replacing the 1791 also cured another problem with SYSGEN. SYSGENing
would work a little better than 50% of the time. Now it never fails.
It would never get off the first track and just hang the system.
Obviously the same problem as the 1st. track is single density. Well,
thanks again for steering me in the right direction.

Tim.

The serial card drives the printer normally under Apple Dos 3.3

This may or may not be relevant.  I had so many difficulties with my
older Softcard (the one that uses the Apple memory) that I trashed it in
favor of the PCPI Applicard (which I think is really neat).

The system crashed without fail when a card other than an Apple disk
controller was in a slot > 3.  Crash symptoms were random.  Crashes
**only** occurred with the > 44k versions, that is, the versions which
attempted to use the extended memory in slot 0.  So there is evidently a
bug in the BIOS in the bank-switching logic.

I wasted a lot of time chasing hardware bugs until I discovered that 44k
2.2b ran and 56k 2.2b crashed.  I tried 3.0 and it crashed too.
Microsoft's technical support consists of the logical equivalent of busy
signals.  So I upgraded to a 6mhz board with ramdisk that works.

Even if (as I assume) you are putting the board in slot 1, Microsoft's
BIOS seems buggy in this area of RAM/ROM address switching and this may
be causing the problem.  Don't expect them to fix or even acknowledge
the difficulty if you pin it down.

We have a year experience with Applicard, and we like it a lot.
The DRI Goldcard works (with a couple of extras over Applicard)
but costs more; it does let you find the output ports better
than Applicard does.  After observing the neighbor kids
experience with the Microsoft version, we elected to try Applicard.

LSWEEP13.COM AND LSWEEP13.DOC BY Joe Vogler are now available on SIMTEL-20
in:

MICRO:<CPM.CPMLIB>

A short description follows:




HOW TO USE LSWEEP
=================

   The program is run this way:

     A> lsweep <lbrname> [<lbrname> ..... <lbrname>]<cr>

Example:

     A> lsweep justone<cr>
     A> lsweep onesy twosy threesy<cr>
     A> lsweep b:this c:that another d:last<cr>

   You can name as many Libraries as you can fit on the command 
line.  You can specify Libraries on different drives.  You must 
specify at least one Library.  The program will 'process' the 
Library names in the order specified.  When you are done with 
one, it continues on to the next, or exits after the last one.You 
can  also use wildcards.   This was not the case with v1.0.   The 
wildcards are expanded by the program.   You'll get lots of  non-
library names if you forget to use '.LBR' when using wildcards.
   For each Library, he program builds a list of member names & 
file sizes and displays one after another, as you hit the RETURN 
key (or any key not set up as a command key).  There are only 
three command keys:

    ? - Displays HELP menu
    V - Views the 'current' member
    E - Extracts the 'current' member
    X - eXits the current Library and proceeds to 
        the next one or quits, if there are no more.

Jim,

Is your software asking for a single sided double density (SSDD) option
selection?  If not, and it just does DSDD -- a disk rated at SSDD DOES still
have the magnetic media on that "back" side, and it CAN still be formatted
and written to.  (You must have missed the Great Double-Sided Disk Debate
on the net a few months ago!)

It's just that the manufacturer did not certify or warrant or guarantee that
"back" side for double density or something.  Maybe it WILL do just fine,
and maybe it WON'T!  Only your trying will tell!

Lots of people buy El Cheapo (no offense, please - I do it too) single sided
single density disks, punch a couple of holes to tell their disk drive it
IS double sided (it's a physical thing, telling the disk drive), and go right
ahead and format/use DSDD!  Sometimes it works and sometimes...

Now, I do NOT understand why your disk drive isn't picking up the physical
difference (location of timing holes, square write protect notch) between
SSDD and DSDD - maybe one of our Kaypro owners out there can enlighten us?

Regards,
David Kirschbaum

	The physical difference between SS and DS diskettes exists only
for 8" diskettes.  5.25" diskettes are basically all identical, and this
is the variety used on all the Kaypros.

ps:By identical I do not include soft- vs. hard-sectored, which are

A contributing factor may be the BIOS firmware shipped with
the Kaypro 4's and 10's.  It doesn't correctly support the CPM disk-reset
function call.  A drive, once logged in with a double-sided disk, remains
double-sided until the next warm boot, despite any disk-reset call.
This is a pain in programs that permit disk swapping, if you have
both single and double-sided disks.

One solution is the CP/M upgrade from Plu*Perfect Systems, which does
the disk-resets correctly.

The only difference between "single side" and "double side" is
quality control; premium disk houses test both sides and if they
get soft errors on one side either put the disk out as single
side or job lot it to somebody else to sell however they want to...

Subject:  Re:  CP/M gang attribute setter needed

The PROTECT program of the ZCPR2 and ZCPR3 systems may be of interest.
It has the following syntax:

	PROTECT list-of-files options

and the options are quite handy in two nice ways specifically:

	PROTECT list-of-files I<attributes>

will set the indicated attributes on the list of files with inspection.
The user is given each file name in the list which matches the list spec
and is asked to approve the setting of the attributes.  Another option:

	PROTECT list-of-files C

goes thru each file in the list and allows the user to manually specify
the attributes for each file.

	Examples:

		PROTECT B7:*.TXT,ROOT:*.*,WORKDIR:MYWORK.ASM R1I

-- sets all *.TXT files in B7, all *.* files in ROOT:, and MYWORK.ASM in
WORKDIR: to Read/Only and attribute 1 with inspection; each file matching
each reference in the list is named, and the user is asked if he wants
to set it

		PROTECT ROOT:*.COM,BASE:*.COM C

-- names all *.COM files in ROOT: and BASE: and allows the user to input
the new attributes for each file named on a case-by-case basis

	In all cases with PROTECT, all 11 attribute bits (A, R, S, and 1-8)
can be referenced.

	Finally, to illustrate one of the big advantages of ZCPR3, PROTECT.COM
is only 4K in size!  One note:  PROTECT.COM for ZCPR3 will ONLY RUN under
ZCPR3.

Subject:  Some Metrics on the ZCPR3 Release

	The release of ZCPR3 is now underway, and the first three shipments
have gone to Echelon in Silicon Valley (see the latest Microsystems for
address/phone), SIMTEL20, and the Air Force Institute of Technology (AFIT)
EE Dept at Wright-Patterson AFB (for internal use, altho they might let
you copy the disks if you are in the AF at WPAFB).  I am preparing three
more shipments to go out soon to SIG/M, the San Diego Computer Society, and
XEROX (again, for internal use, altho they might let you copy the disks
if you work for XEROX).  AMPRO Computers was one of the test sites, and an
earlier version of ZCPR3 (1 before the release) has been hidden on their
disks for some time now, and they will be upgrading to the release soon
(see the AMPRO ads if you want to contact them).  Also, Echelon has installed
ZCPR3 on the Kaypro 10 (again, 1 before the release version), and you can
contact Echelon for details if you are interested.

	The release of ZCPR3 is taking place in three phases:

		Phase 1 --
			the ZCPR3 Command Processor
			the main ZCPR3 System Segments
			a 120-page installation manual
			a 40-page user's perspective
			58 utilities and associated HLP files
			SYSLIB 3.0 and associated HLP files
			[ complete sources to all of the above]
		Phase 2 --
			more ZCPR3 utilities and HLP files
			more System Segments
			Z3LIB and associated HLP files
			VLIB and associated HLP files
			TIMELIB and associated HLP files
			[ all sources provided ]
		Phase 3 --
			published book: ZCPR3 user/programmer doc
			published book: ZCPR3 libraries
			[ bookpublished by NY Zoetrope, Inc ]

	The doc provided in phases 1 and 2 is quite adequate to install
and begin using the system.  The books provide hardcopy of all online
doc and much internal information (which is not available elsewhere).

	There are 14 disks in the ZCPR3 Phase 1 distribution --

		2 ZCPR3 System disks (ZCPR3 CP and System Segments)
		1 ZCPR3 utilities (all COM files)
		2 HLP files documenting the utilities and CP/Sys Segs
		3 sources for utilities
		1 installation manual (WordStar with MailMerge needed to print)
		1 user's perspective (WS with MM needed to print)
		3 SYSLIB 3.0 sources
		1 SYSLIB 3.0 HLP files and 2/3 differences

	ZCPR3 Phase 1 Statistics --

		58 utilities, the largest of which is 8K in size
		Lines of Code:
			ZCPR3 Command Processor		 4669
			ZCPR3 Sys Segments (6)		 7655
			ZCPR3 utilities (58)		35588
			SYSLIB 3.0 sources		14433
		Documentation:
			ZCPR3 Ins Manual (120 pp)	 6086 lines
			ZCPR3 User's Pers 40pp)		 1940 lines
			ZCPR3 HLP files (17)		 8465 lines
			SYSLIB 3.0 HLP files (20)	 4572 lines
			SYSLIB 2/3 diff summary		  239 lines


	More detail later on how to contact Echelon and Zoetrope.

	As more sets of disks are released, I will post locations to the net.

Well,

I have heard enough to know that ZCPR is a good thing.  But where do I
start?  I have pulled in most of the ZCPR1 stuff but do I even need to
bother?  Can I go straight to ZCPR3?  And the ZCPR2 files seem to (at
least they left off the 2) seem to use ZCPR.COM from version 1.  Am I
wrong?  Can someone give me some general guidance?

Thanks in advance.

Basically each of the ZCPRs are independent, upgraded versions of the earlier
numbered ZCPRs.  These are effectively replacements of the part of the CP/M
operating system that processes terminal input to the OS.  Rich Conn has then
written many utility programs, that have been long needed.

I would recommend that you don't waste your time on the ZCPR(1) files, perhaps
pull down the documentation files from ZCPR2, just for background, and go
directly to ZCPR3.

Two of the ZCPR3 Phase 1 release packages have been received at their
destinations, and reports back are quite good.  Echelon has installed the
new system on several machines now, and no errors have been encountered.
All utilities check out as far as they have been tested so far.  The only
complaint has been that a few typos were found in the installation manual
and the HLP files, but the typos do not impact meaning or present any
misinformation - they are merely cases like two "the" phrases in a row.
All HLP files will be corrected when they are incorporated into the books.

Lt Col Carter at AFIT, WPAFB, has brought up ZCPR3 after only a few hours
of effort.  He had prior knowledge of ZCPR2, and his reports were that with
this knowledge, ZCPR3 came up without any problem.  The BIOS mods were along
the line of ZCPR2 and the installation manual was complete with all necessary
detail.  Lt Col Carter brought up ZCPR3 without any instruction from me,
just using the manuals.  I think that this illustrates the
completeness of the manuals.  He also reported some typos in the
installation manual, but, again, they were minor.

I have completed copying all sets of disks in my possession now,
so 4 sets of disks should go out Monday or Tuesday.  Will let
you know when this happens and to whom.

Phase 2 of the ZCPR3 release should happen in a few weeks, and then
the books will come out (Phase 3).  Again, details on events as they
happen.

    Recently one of our members put out a message about a PD program
    called MT180L.COM, a little utility to configure the Mannesman
    Tally 180L printer.  I downloaded it from SIMTEL20 and it works
    perfectly with the MT160L (the 11" model).  

    Nice little utility, pretty formatting, fancy command line and
    input parsing, MUCH better than pawing through the manual and
    working the front-panel command input!

    More glory to the author, Ray Kester.

Subject: BBS vs. TELCO (LONG message)
To: INFO-CPM@Mit-Mc.ARPA

	In a telephone interview Friday, Douglas Cambern,
Executive Director of Pacific Bell, told me, eventually, that
perhaps Bell had been a bit more severe than was wise; this
after I pointed out that Telco had probably managed to make
enemies out of a lot of rather intelligent people who did NOT
assert any right to publicise telephone codes, etc.
	Cambern wiggled a lot, obviously unhappy at having to
defend the phone company employees action in insisting that
Tcimpidas' equipment be siezed; he admitted that Tcimpidas was
"terribly cooperative".  When I pointed out that Telco actions
cost quite a lot of time and money for Tcimpidas, Cambern took
the position that both Tcimpidas and Telco were "joint victims"
of the people who had posted the codes.  He wasn't too
comfortable with th fact that Telco lost less ("hundreds of
dollars") thant T cimpidas.
	I also pointed out that the recent actions and publicity
would probably generate some desire to harass the Phone co.
among people who would not otherwise thnk of doing that.  His
reply is interesting: "Aperson who is psychologically disposed
to take illegal actions has a character defect that will
eventually cause him to be caught."  He didn't reply when I
said, "O, like Patrick Henry?"
	In any event Cambern now wishes he had attended the
meeting of BBS operators in LA, and would like to attend a
meeting of BBS people with a view to seeing if application of
technological smarts and ingenuity can result in BBS and Telco
cooperating on a fix to the difficulty.  I think he meant it,
although given a telephone interview and the smug attitude he
started with it's hard to be sure.
	Anyone interested in putting together such a meeting
with a high Pacific Bell official (he promises to bring
technical types from Security)?  No guarantees that this isn't
some kind of ploy, but it might be real.
	It was interesting as his attitude changed: in beginning
he couldn't spell or pronouce my name althugh it had been both
spelled and pronounced for him, and he asked if that was
"B-I-T-E Magazine"; after a bit when he learned I had been the
Director of Research for the City of LA, (and that BYTE is not
so small as he thought, and McGraw-Hill not so insignificant as
he hoped) there was a decided change in attitude.
	I don't figure it's my place to organize such a meeting;
I'd loke to come to it, and I'll be glad to convey any
invitation to Cambern if something interesting looks like it
might develop.
	I've been unable to log in on Tcimpidas' BB (line busy
all the time) so anyone who could relay this to him might be
doing him a service.

places but didn't see it.

Has anyone written such a thing?  Please, he will need source code as

Don't be surprised if the updates to cpm etc don't fix your 630 bug.
I bet your using wordstar.  The newer versions of wordstar have a bug
in the etx-ack protocol area when using HMI to right justify.
I tried to get them to fix it to no avail.  It seems that if the
HMI sequence happens to be an ETX char then the printer responds
with an ack and loses the next char or two which are assumed to
be the finish of the HMI sequence.  Old versions
of wordstar don't have the problem.  Early versions of the 630
also had a bug in their roms you might check with Diablo on the
rev date of your diablo.

I disagree with the recommendation that time spent on ZCPR1 would be a
waste.  Personally, I found ZCPR2 to be not worth the time spent to
hack my BIOS for the few extra features it offered (that I wanted)..

ZCPR1 is about as easy to bring up on a system as is possible.  It
doesn't require that you transfer ~10 disks worth of files.  And it is
very "standard" as far as CP/M and every transient program that I have
ever tried.

This is not a critizism of ZCPR2, rather an endorsement of ZCPR1.

Subject: Zilog SIO as a network controller
To: info-micro@BRL.ARPA, info-cpm@BRL.ARPA
cc: rgf@SIMTEL20.ARPA

I'm involved in a project that involves the interconnection of several
Micro's as a local area network under TurboDOS.  I had planned to use
one of the (very expensive, as it turns out) various new network
controller chips, such as the WD2840 or COMM-9026.  Recently, however
I found out that the Zilog SIO is capable of 800KHz operation (in fact,
I've heard that Televideo's TurboDOS implementation employs the SIO as
the network controller).  Since all of the computers I'm working with
already have at least one SIO, I'd prefer to abandon the "fancy" net
controller in favor of an SIO.

Problem is, it seems that to get this kind of speed, you have to run
in one of the synchronous modes (SDLC or Bisync).  Does anyone know
if this is true?  Programming examples would be very helpful also
(I don't suppose anyone has a TurboDOS driver already written for a
high-speed SIO??? )

Another thing I'm not too sure of is the RS-422 interface itself
(I'm considering a bus topology).  When one station is transmitting
on the RS-422, do all other transmitters have to be tri-stated? If
so, what kind of turn-around is required for a station to become a
transmitter?

Any help will be much appreciated.			--Ron Fowler

I think that ZCPR3  will be available
in both licenced and public domain versions.  Rick Conn has posted notes
to this group implying that Z3 wil be p/d, but is not finished yet.

I know tyhat at least one system, the Ampro Little Board, has a licenced
version of ZCPR2 available.

ZCPR2 is unique unto itself.  It does not use anything from ZCPR1.

MY FEELING is that for new users, it would be best to go straight to
ZCPR3.  The installation manual is complete, and the online HLP files
tell you how everything works.  When the book comes out, all documentation
will be in hardcopy form, but that will not be for a while yet.

It will take a while to get used to the concepts of ZCPR3.  The Concepts
manual of ZCPR2 can still serve to provide the basis for ZCPR3 understanding,
but some items have changed, such as the named directory concept.

As with ZCPR2, the hard part of ZCPR3 is getting it up.  Once up, however,
it is quite easy to use.

For now, then, I recommend: get ZCPR3 and use the Concepts manual of ZCPR2
for understanding until the ZCPR3 book comes out.

You are right about the Ampro Little Board -- it is running ZCPR3.
The same ZCPR3 is available to be licensed commercially and from SIG/M.
The release to SIG/M, however, is not to the public domain, but rather to
the ZCPR3 User Community - if I release it to the pd, I lose all rights to
it.  You will not find any reference to the pd in any of the ZCPR3 files
or documentation - it is not in the pd, and I have a copyright pending on
it with the US Gov't.  However, you can acquire it thru the regular sources -
SIG/M, BBSes, etc - and it is fine with me if you use it.

If you are a commercial user who wants to include it in your product,
obtaining a license from Echelon is preferred.  The money made from this
(the cost of a license is very low) is used to support Echelon and its
activities, such as the ZCPR3 BBS, and a percentage of the profit goes back
to me (in support of my further activities).  I don't plan to make much
money from this - I mainly hope that Echelon makes enough to continue its
activities with ZCPR3.

If you are a non-commercial user, Echelon offers you an option thru which
to acquire ZCPR3.  You can get ZCPR3 thru Echelon, SIG/M, a BBS, etc.
All are alternatives for you.  What I like about Echelon which the others
do/may not offer is:

	1. Echelon has a phone number, thru which you can place orders
	2. Echelon will be providing technical support (probably for a minor
fee) if you have questions and/or problems installing ZCPR3 et al
	3. Echelon will be supporting a BBS which you can use for bug reports
and to obtain support/answers to questions; I am tied into Echelon and this BBS
	4. Echelon has promised a FAST turnaround on orders; they have
contracted with a professional disk copying service and have set up things
so they can respond quickly to the users
	5. I am relieved of the burdon of support and questions from each
user individually - this is a huge time sink - but I am still in contact with
the users, et al, if problems come up with the system
	6. Echelon has some excellent people behind it - Frank Gaude (who
wrote DISK7 and COMM7) and Joe Wright (who is known for his expertise in
writing BIOSes, such as the Ampro BIOS) - who can provide good technical
support
	7. Echelon has a staff to handle details and answer the phone;
they are not technically-oriented, but they can take orders and do other
things
	8. Echelon has facilities to handle distribution of the ZCPR3
book (they will be the first to have it when it comes out).  Computer
clubs and other organizations, such as bookstores, are also welcome to
negotiate with Zoetrope for sales rights, so the book will also not be
exclusive to Echelon.

These services provided by Echelon are available to commercial and non-
commercial users.  I like Echelon, but am not directly related and cannot
be held responsible for their actions (so if you have a problem with something
they did, such as send you some disks, contact them and not me).  If they
respond like they say they will, I think we can all benefit from them.
I view this as an experiment at this time (support like this has not been
available to the users before), and am interested in seeing how it works out.


	I will post info on how to access Echelon and Zoetrope in
a day or so.

Subject: Using MEX 1.0 with Sanyo

Forwaded from RCPM Royal Oak:

Date: 5/29/84
From: Richard Latimer
To:   Ron Fowler
Re:   MEX/Sanyo bug fix

MEX 1.0 has the same SANYO MBC-1000 glitch that the MDMxxx series 
has.  When a connection is made after continuous dialing both go 
to a loop doing KEYSTAT, WAIT, & BELL.  The routines in this 
order lock the keyboard out and more or less hang the system.  
The problem can be eliminated by calling the routines in this 
order:  KEYSTAT, BELL, WAIT.  It involves changing 13E9h to Call 
437BH, and 13ECH to Call 0E53H.
   
I hope you can change these lines in version 2.  MEX is a great 
program, and I thank you very much.  When I have the my SANYO 
overlay spruced up I'll upload it.

Subject: USENET access to SIMTEL20 archives
To: info-cpm@Amsaa.ARPA
Cc: edelheit@Mitre.ARPA

"How can a user of a USENET host access the public domain
microcomputer software collection on the DDN/MILNET host
SIMTEL20" is being asked with increasing frequency as that
software collection continues to grow.  Unfortunately, direct
access is not possible as there is no UUCP gateway for file
transfer between SIMTEL20 (running TOPS-20) and a USENET host (as
there is for electronic mail).

(DDN, formerly known as ARPANET, is the Defense Data Network.
DDN, along with Arpanet, SATNET, SRINET, etc. are all members of 
a TCP/IP protocol-based, multiple gateway network called Internet.)

USENET has been built on adjacent hosts voluntarily agreeing to
store-and-forward relatively short messages across the USENET
over dialup lines at 300 or 1200 bps.  In the past, helpful InterNet
users would fetch the file(s) requested and then e-mail them to
the requestor.  However, it has been pointed out that large file
transfers disrupt the service, delay the shorter messages, and
generate unacceptably large phone bills, all of which add up to
threaten the tenuous connections that some USENET hosts can
barely afford to have.  Therefore, we have been asked to
encourage InterNet users not to pass archive programs this way.

Now for the good news.  Some InterNet users, if sent a suitable disk,
will download files and return mail the floppy to the requestor.
To find a friendly InterNet user, send a message to INFO-CPM at DDN
host AMSAA.ARPA via net.micro.cpm identifying your disk format and 
your request.  Usually, someone will respond  message and come to your
to your aid.  If not, don't be bashful, wait a week and try again.
But please remember, any such arrangements are strictly between you
and your respondent.  This is not, repeat NOT, a service of either
the InterNet or INFO-CPM.

If the above arrangement is inconvenient, or doesn't work, here
are several other sources for public domain software.


----------------------------------------------------------------------

Information (and prices) are subject to change without notice.  A
volume is usually one floppy disk.


1.  CP/M User's Group

The CP/MUG volumes are available from:

  CP/M User's Group
  1651 3rd Avenue
  New York, NY 10028

Current volumes are numbered 1 through 92 at $13 per 8" SSSD disk
(Northstar format also available).  The catalog is $6.


2.  Special Interest Group/Microcomputers (SIG/M)

 The SIG/M volumes are distributed by:

  SIG/M
  Amateur Computer Group of New Jersey, Inc.
  Box 97
  Iselin, NJ 08830

Current volumes are numbered 000 through 172.  The first disk is
$6.00 and $5.00 for each additional disk.  The catalog is $2.


3.  New York Amateur Computer Club

PC-BLUE software volumes for the IBM-PC are available from:

  S-100, CP/M User Group
  The New York Amateur Computer Club
  P.O.  Box 106
  Church Street Station
  New York, NY  10008

The documentation files from the SIG/M and CPMUG volumes are
available in hardcopy form, grouped into "books", from the NYACC.
Each book is priced at $10 including shipping, $15 for overseas
airmail.  All orders must be prepaid.


4.  PicoNet CP/M Users Group

PicoNet, CP/MUG, and SIG/M software volumes are available from:

  PicoNet
  P.O. Box 391566
  Mountain View, CA 94039

Available in 8" and most 5 1/4" soft sector only at $6.00 per
disk plus $1.50 shipping per order.  California residents add
6.5% sales tax.  Quantity discounts are available.


5. Other sources:

Compuserve Information Service is another source of public domain
software. There are a number of special interest groups (SIGs)
devoted to specific hardware as well as CP-MIG, the generic CP/M
SIG, a repository for a large quantity of public domain software
downloadable by the Compuserve file transer protocol (Christensen
protocol is expected by late summer, 1984). There is no charge for
access to CP-MIG other than the standard CIS connect charges, and
Compuserve can be accessed through their own communications network
or through Tymnet.

Microsystems magazine periodically publishes a full list of
sources for public domain software in addition to those listed
here, with monthly updates/additions.

... and many Remote CP/M (RCPM) systems around the country, where
software is available for downloading for the price of a phone
call.  The May 1984 issue of Microsystems contains the full listing of
known RCPMs at the time of publication.


I would like to thank Dave Towson, Frank Wancho and Charlie Strom for all
their assistance in putting this blurb together.  If anybody out in InterNet
Land has any questions or comments about the above blurb, feel free to 
contact any one of us.

re: all the discussion of how to get ZCPR3, how about someone giving a
general description of ZCPR3 itself - its capablities, requirements, and
installation. Does it run under standard CP/M 3.0 ? Does it need
banked memory or can it run in non-banked environments? Does the BIOS
have to modified or have extensions added? 

For the sake of us without FTP access, please post on info-cpm rather
than referring us to DOC file somewhere that we cannot get to.

Subject: Password echo patch for MEX 1.0

Forwarded from the RCPM Sysop Clearinghouse:

;   DATE 22jun84 2344
;
For Version 1.0 of MEX with bug fixes up to 3... NOT tested with any file
greater than these....

This file will link WCHAR to the function key OUT routines instead of them
being linked to the WTECHO routines.

The priority for linking to the OUT routine is WTECHO first and if it is
OFF then it links to WCHAR.

This is needed because if you use a function key to send your password to
a remote system that does NOT echo the same characters as the ones that you
are sending, the system will wait forever using the WTECHO routines...

So normally set WTECHO OFF and WCHAR delay to 0 ms.  You may find that you
will have to increase the delay time on some systems that are using a basic
program such as RBBS... Assembly programs such as E-MX and CBBS should respond
well at 0 ms.

To use this file strip the POKE statements out of this file and call the
file PASSON.MEX ... at the >> prompt in MEX type READ PASSON.MEX  then CLONE
a new version of MEX...  (PLEASE use a DIFFERENT name for the clone!!!)

Routine written by Bob Schultz, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.

--------------------------------------------------<<<<<<<
This is the routine to install the patch:

POKE $0A00 $AF $32 $E4 $52 $C5 $CD $96 $3E $C1 $C3 $DF $1E
POKE $1EF4 $CA $00 $0A

Subject: 16 bit files uploaded
To:   INFO-CPM@Brl-Aos.ARPA
cc:   CSTROM@Simtel20.ARPA

For those hardy souls not caving in to big blue, I have uploaded a
couple of 16 bit utilities for CP/M-86 and MP/M-86 to Simtel20. These
files may be found in the <CPM.CPM86> directory, which, incidentally,
is painfully small. The few files resident there could use a little
company!

	DELBR11.CMD
	DELBR11.DOC

DELBR is the 16 bit equivalent of the 2.2 utility of the same name -
it will break a Novosielski-type library (.LBR) file into its members.

	NUSQ110.CMD
	NUSQ110.D}iOC

NUSQ is a file unsqueezer written in 8086 assembly language. This
program is not merely a literal translation of the eight bit code - it
has had some optimization performed, and as a rule, it is very fast.
The doc file describes both CP/M-86 and MSDOS versions. I could
probably upload the latter if demand so dictates.

Subject: CP/M and CB80 questions
Article-I.D.: asgb.500

( whew!  The li      ng monster onl         ouple of bites )

   I have a couple of questions which Digital Research left unanswered
in their documentation.  I understand they have been improving,
but the versions of their manuals I have seem to fall short of the
quality of their software.
   I did try calling them, but they refused to answer, as I have not
purchased their $250.00 programmers support subscription.  Sounds
rather outrageous at first, but I guess they have to do that or else
they would end up consulting for half the country.

The questions:
   1.	This question is about the CP/M* file "$$$.SUB".  How does
	one generate the values for the first byte of each sector?
	I've written a nicer version of the "SUBMIT" command, and
	this is the only thing keeping it from working.


   2.	When compiling CB-80* programs, is there any way to tell the
	compiler a given function, variable, or statement label is
	either external or global so they may be referenced by all
	linked modules?

	I am converting a program to CB-80 for a friend.  I would
	like to plthece the main menu and a frequently used functions
	in the resident module and have them callable from overlays.
	I saw no provision for this in their manual, and I don't have
	the compiler on my system to experiment with.

   I would appreciate some help anyone might be able to give me
on these questions.  Please reply with "mail".

<This bug zapper for those that like to forward...>
Hello NetLanders -

     Since I posted the original message requesting 6809 source to the
popular USQ and SQ programs, there have been a bunch of "If you see it,
please send me a copy." type messages in my mailbox.

     But no real responses.  Surely someone must have it?  Or, if not
in 6809 source, maybe the C source?  I think I can find a 6809 C compiler
someplace around here.

     Anywho, here's a re-posting of the original message:

     <This bug zapper for those that like to forward...>

     I have a request from a local sysop for a 6809-based version
     of the popular USQueezer program.  I looked around in some of
     the obvious places but didn't see it.

     Has anyone written such a thing?  Please, he will need source
     code as he is using a non-standard OS and will have to modify
     the I/O code to fit.

	  Thanks in advance...

     PS:  If you have the SQueezer program, please forward that, too.
          It will be welcome.

To: haar%gmr.csnet@CSNET-RELAY.ARPA

Some time ago, I sent out a rather lengthy intro to ZCPR3 to INFO-CPM.
I am including the first of 10 messages which made up that intro here
in response to your question.  This is carboned to INFO-CPM in case there
are others with the same question.  If you would like more detail than what
this provides, I will send all ten messages to you at your request.

Re your specific questions, ZCPR3 is CP/M 2.2 compatible, as ZCPR1 and ZCPR2
were.  Since full source code is provided, the potential exists for adapting
it to CP/M 3.0.  In order to take advantage of the extended capabilities
of ZCPR3, a BIOS modification (which is optional) is required.  If you do
no chose to make the BIOS modification, most of the features are lost and
you may as well use ZCPR1.


      AN INTRODUCTION TO ZCPR3 FROM THE USER'S PERSPECTIVE

                         by Richard Conn




     The  ZCPR3 System is a collection of programs  based  around 
the  ZCPR3  Command Processor.   Forming an integrated system  of 
tools,  the  ZCPR3  System  offers a  number  of  convenient  and 
sometimes  more  user-friendly  features to the  CP/M  2.2  user.  
Maintaining  CP/M  2.2  compatibility  at all  times  (all  known 
commercial   CP/M   2.2   programs  run   under   ZCPR3   without 
modification),  the ZCPR3 System brings to its users a variety of 
tools  which  conceptually  implement  features  found  in  other 
operating  systems,  including TOPS-20 (1),  UNIX (2),  NOS  (3), 
MULTICS  (4),  and VMS (5),  and tools which  implement  features 
unique to the ZCPR3 System (to my knowledge).

     This  Introduction  is intended to outline some of  the  key 
features  of the ZCPR3 System from the user's perspective.   More 
complete technical details of implementation and use will  follow 
later.   Knowledge  of CP/M 2.2 is assumed,  and some  experience 
with  ZCPR2  is  useful,  in order to  understand  the  following 
presentation  in detail.   The major features of the ZCPR3 System 
which are described in this Introduction include:


          o Directories       o Wheel Users and Passwords

          o Command Lines     o Command Processing
                                   o Resident Command Packages
                                   o Flow Command Packages
                                   o ZEX Command Files

          o Error Handlers    o Aliases

          o Shells            o Z3TCAP
               o Variable          o Screen-Oriented Terminal
               o MENU                   Configuration
               o VFILER

          o "Secure" Systems

Re:   Zcpr Hooks

Yes, there is one "big" hook you can look forward to in ZCPR3 which is
necessary to give you perhaps 80% of the new features.  A 1K (my
recommendation) buffer area is needed to contain the ZCPR3 Environment
Descriptor (which includes TCAP - Terminal Capabilities Entry), named
directory buffer, shell stack, messages, external FCB, external stack,
and (perhaps) path.  This is detailed to the nth degree in the
installation manual, which is included in the distribution.  If you
have ZCPR2 up, you should have no problem getting ZCPR3 up.  It
involves just more of the same types of BIOS initializations.

Also, if you remember the old GENINS procedure for ZCPR2, the ZCPR3
generalized installation program involves issued one simple command
and watching Z3INS step thru all the programs in the INS file,
installing everything it finds. The 58 utilities in Phase 1 release
took me about 4 minutes to install.

NetLandians,

Got my new PROMS in the other day for my Decision I, and a new CBIOS to
implement soft-sector 5.25 drives.  All very nice, except the CP/M with
the new CBIOS had expanded from 16 pages to 18 pages.

Morrow documentation explained how their MOVCPM had a byte at 103h that
you could patch for 16 or 18, to adjust for the new CP/M length.  Unfortunately,
it didn't work.  For the first time I encountered the "Synchronization Error"
which rudely throws you right into your monitor with a HLT instruction!

Looking at MOVCPM isn't much help because it's a hotbed of self-patching
code, and nothing's like it appears once it starts running!  It even does
a tricky XTHL or something to call up the "Synchron..." so you can't even
intercept that call.

Someone told me the abort happens when serial numbers or version numbers or
something don't match -- but I couldn't make much sense of that.

I finally kludged my way around the problem - stepped through the 18-page
MOVCPM with DDT until it crashed, noted the number of operations (just over
3000 (sigh...)), and then stepped to just sort of the crash, zipped out of
DDT, and saved my new 18-page CP/M - but that's no way to do things!
It isn't anything unique about the new MOVCPM or a bug there -- I overlaid
my old MOVCPM over top of the front of the code, and the same thing
happened!

Anyone know exactly WHY you can't MOVCPM an 18-page (or whatever) CP/M
when you're running an older, smaller CP/M in your system?  Memory seems to
have nothing to do with it (e.g., couldn't construct a 48Kb CP/M in my
64K system).  Patch something in the old CP/M?  In MOVCPM?  What?

I fought this for THREE DAYS, so I really would like to know why.

Thanks in advance,
David Kirschbaum (a very weary hacker)

NetLandians,

I need some advice from you all or perhaps any publishers on the net.
(Byte, are you out there?)

Code, articles found in magazines -- can we type them in and upload them,
distribute, etc., as Public Domain (assuming, of course, we'd keep all
credits, bibliographic information, etc.)?  Specifically the Spreadsheet
listing and article in the latest Byte.

Alternatively, is it acceptable to ask the publisher or copyright holder,
case by case, for permission, and do it then (including their permission)?

The wonderful Dr. Dobbs is Public Domain by its very nature and heritage,
and we commonly see things from there ... but what about the others?

I'd like to share the wealth; it SHOULDN'T hurt the magazine if we wait a
month or two before uploading (won't directly affect sales very much
that way).

I'll be glad to consolidate opinions for the net, and forward responses
from any specific publisher if desired.

Regards,
David Kirschbaum

Subject:  Another ZCPR3 system up and running...

I have installed ZCPR3 on a Big Board system with little problem in about
4 hours of effort.  I was running ZCPR2 before.  The system is as Rick Conn
advertizes and runs better than I expected on a floppy disk system.  (Rick
uses a winnie for all his work).  Using a double density 8" disk drive
system (~670 Kbytes per disk) I can put all of the ZCPR3 utilities and system
segments on a disk with about 300 Kbytes left.  The system loads fast and runs
very fast in spite of the extra transient programs which are executed to support
shells, aliases and IF constructs.
	One of the nicest features is the TCAP (like TERMCAP) capability.  On a
Televideo 950, almost all utilities are screen oriented with half intensity
enhancement.  Very Nice!
	I think Rick Conn has a real winner here.  The entire system is
user friendly and consistent.  Get a copy from SIGM or SIMTEL20.  You will
like it....

David - Here are three messages I saved from a while ago which apply to your
recent query concerning MOVCPM "synchronization error".  If you work out the
patches to MOVCPM that will disable this feature, please let us know.  I
realize the feature was put there to prevent people from doing bad things to
CP/M by trying to move it with the wrong version of mover, but it is a
nuisance at times, isn't it.

Subject:  Re:  BDOS secrets

Hi --

1.  The first six bytes of the BDOS (before the entry point) contain the
serial number.  In CP/M systems, the serial number is contained within
the CCP and the BDOS.

2.  The four byte-pairs after the entry point are addresses of subroutines
to be executed when certain BDOS errors occur.  Specifically, these four
byte pairs have the following meanings:

	1st Pair:  Address of Permanent Disk Error routine; this
			routine is executed when bad block is encountered
	2nd Pair:  Address of Select Error routine; this routine
			is executed when a select to an invalid disk
			(such as E when the BIOS allows for up to D)
			is made
	3rd Pair:  Address of Disk R/O Error routine; this routine
			is executed when a write to a R/O disk is attempted
	4th Pair:  Address of File R/O Error routine; this routine
			is executed when a write to a R/O file is attempted

As a rule, these routines usually print an error message and then do a
warm boot.  Utilities may use these to trap out errors they cause and
perform other functions besides warm boot.

To summarize, the picture looks like this:

Base of BDOS:	DS	6	;Serial Number
		JMP	BDOSE	;Enter the BDOS at the command processor
		DW	PERSUB	;Permanent Disk Error
		DW	SELSUB	;Select Disk Error
		DW	ROSUB	;R/O Disk Error
		DW	RONSUB	;R/O File Error
BDOSE:		...		;BDOS command processing

Re:   BDOS secrets

1) Those six bytes at the beginning are the CP/M serial number; they 
   have little significance to anything other than the MOVCPM program
   (which disables interrupts and halts if these numbers do not match 
   MOVCPM's internal serial number).  I'm also told that some rather
   rude implementations of CP/M come with utilities that take it upon
   themselves to do this serial number check also.

2) The four vectors are pointers to the following routines (in order):

	a. Permanent error subroutine (ie, BDOS ERROR ON X: BAD
	   SECTOR)
	b. Select error
	c. Disk read/only error
	d. File read/only error

   The BDOS uses these addresses to find the corresponding error-
   handling subroutine; in theory, a transient program could overlay
   this table with pointers to its own routines, and thereby circum-
   vent the unfriendly BDOS error handlers, replacing the routines
   with more human-oriented messages.  In practice, few programs do
   this; it's a risky practice, and not quite as clear-cut as it
   sounds.			--Ron Fowler

Have you ever noticed that when MOVCPM halts with a serial number
disparity, it prints:

            SYNCRONIZATION [sic] ERROR

This goes back as far as I can remember (version 1.?).  Maybe they 
were looking for one byte to save in MOVCPM and dumped the 'H'? :-)

David - I suggest that you just disable the serial number checking in MOVCPM,
and leave all else alone, which is what I believe you intend to do.  MOVCPM
contains the actual code of the CP/M operating system, along with a bit-map
showing which bytes must be relocated for the different size versions.  If you
diddle the wrong thing, you'll screw it up.  I have been wanting to have a hack
at this myself, but just haven't gotten to it.  It sounds like you have already
located the area where you have to change things.
