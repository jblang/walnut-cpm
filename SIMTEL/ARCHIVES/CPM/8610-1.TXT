RE: Eric Swanson's assertion that there is an IBM-PC board that will read
Apple disks.

True.  I don't remember the name of it, Quadram sticks in mind but that's
probably wrong.  But the board isn't a disk adapter, it's an Apple ][ 
emulator that will allow you to pretend that your PC is an Apple.  It doesn't
support format conversion between disk formats - when it's active, your
PC is no longer a PC.  The board will do almost but not quite all of the
things an Apple ][ does, but unless there has been an upgrade, it isn't
even close to an Apple //e or //c.

Subject:  MEX114 at 4800/9600 Baud

Having used IMP244 and KERMIT405 for various communications chores on
my HEATH H89A, I finally got around to trying out MEX114.  This is a
very impressive program and works fine for me at 1200 and 2400 baud.
Trouble starts when I try to connect into my local mainframe at 4800
or 9600 baud.  At these rates, MEX starts losing characters on the 
receiving end.  I have tried turning QUEUE off and increasing PQSIZE
(from 150 to 450) to no avail.  Being new to the program, I'm wondering
whether I have missed something.  Any hints or pointers would be 
appreciated.

Thanks in advance,

Help!  I have almost all the pieces but I'm not quite there.

I'm trying to get my IBM PC to read and write 8" CP/M format
disks.  Hence this posting to both cpm and ibmpc lists.

I have just gotten an 8" disk controller (from Floppy Disk Services,
Inc., a pretty good disk hardware supplier) made by Maynard.
They sold me a device driver by Flagstaff Engineering which makes
the 8" drives appear as DOS formatted devices and which allows
low level access to the drives.  I have Media Master, which goes
between DOS and CP/M file formats, but only on 5" drives. They
say they are not planning to support 8" formats.

So I need the program that knows CP/M formats and runs on the PC.
FDSI has one for sale, at the LUDICROUS price of $595.00!
Does anyone know of something at a reasonable price?  Or has
anyone got some low level disk accessing code that I could
use to write my own?

Thanks,

X-VMS-To: CSNET%"info-68k@ucbvax.berkeley.edu", CSNET%"info-cpm@amsaa.arpa"

These files comprise a PD 8080 (CP/M-80 2.2) emulator that runs under
CP/M-68K. The emulator is the one published in DDJ.  I made some
modifications to properly handle the base page setup for the target
processor (this only affects programs which use the second FCB in the base
page).


Here is a directory listing on the files on SIMTEL20:

Filename			Type	 Bytes	 CRC

Directory PD:<CPM.CPM68K>
COM2.68K.1			BINARY	 23808  5707H
COM2.LBR.1			BINARY	 50688  7230H

The .68K file is a ready-to-run relocatable executable.  The .LBR file
contains the source code (four squeezed .s files and two undsqueezed .sub
files for re-building the .68K file).  Note:  this is a straight 8080
emulator.  There are hooks for some of the Z80 instructions, so an
enterprising 68K assembly/Z80 hacker can implement a Z80 emulator.

These files also exist on GEnie (in the CP/M RTL) and on BIX (listings, cpm
area).  I don't know if Keith Peterson downloaded to his RCP/M system or
not.

[This must be the line eater]

This is my first request on the net, so please be easy on me.

I am a novice (very novice) graphics person. I hope I ask this in the 
right words.  I am looking for a cheap way (buying or building) to
take a picture (frame) from a video camera and to put it on my 
computer. This means to take the video and convert it to digital
and to have a program convert it to match my graphics screen.

I have a CP/M-MSDOS computer ( not IBM compatable) with 640/400
pixel resolution with 8 colors(no grey scale). I know that there
are many boards out there for S100/IBM busses. What I would
probably need is a system that hooks up by RS232. Or I could
build my own adapter, which will probably not be easy.

I would appreciate any information that any one could send me
on how to do this or companies that I could get information from.

Thanks in advance.

Subject: super LU-like program

I'm looking for a program that 

-- adds/deletes members to a library
-- allows viewing members of the library (even if squeezed)
-- squeezes and unsqueezes members
-- allows mass operations 

Some time ago, I heard of a program would do most of this; I think
this program was called NSWP, but it had bad bugs in it (that trashed
directories?); I seem to recall that these bugs were being fixed, but I
haven't heard anything since then (several months ago).

Can anyone help?  (P.S. I tried loading the file called NSWP.LBR from
SIMTEL20, but when I tried to use LU on it, I got a msg saying "Old
library: no directory, and then LU aborted on me.)

Thanks.

What machine do you have.  I was thinking about building one for my 
Zenith Z-100 (S-100) CP/M-85, MS-DOS machine, but I just use on
rare occasions a Data Translation device on an PC-BUS at work and
copy the data for use with my programs on the Z-100.   I was thinking
of designing one for RS-232C, but even at 9600 or 19.2K Baud, it would
take a minute or more to save/load images.   Also, aside from the
novelity, what good is it really?   And the most important question -
How much would you and/or the public be willing to pay for one?
With development costs, PC-board design and manufacture, loan interests,
parts (FLASH Video A2Ds are VERY expensive), I figured that a 640x480x256
grey scale device would cost about $600 to produce at cost, about $400
more for color.   You might be better off designing a BUS Interface and
be able to plug in S-100 or PC-BUS products into your machine.

Cheers,
Gern

The most versitile program I have seen is "Xenocopy PC" from

Phone (415) 525-3113. This product supports 5 1/4 (40 & 80 track),
8in, and 3 1/2in drives if you have the appropriate hardware.

I do not know if can handle your controller or not. But it
might be worth a phone call to find out.  Program price is
under a hundred dollars.

and Dennis Wright's ZRDOS disk operating system (replaces the BDOS).  This
is the state-of-the-art operating system for Z80 (and NS800 and HD64180

Card, Software Let PCs Read Apple Disks
The Matchpoint-PC package, which includes a card and software, lets IBM PC
users read from and write to Apple DOS, ProDOS, SOS, and CP/M disks.  The
half-size card fits in a PC expansion slot and includes connectors and cable
to hook it to the floppy disk drives.
Besides Matchpoint software, the package comes with UniForm-PC (version 2),
which makes the computer read CP/M disks as if they were PC-DOS disks.  Used
with the Matchpoint board, it also lets you use Apple Softcard and North Star
CP/M disks on a PC.

Subject: Re:  Apple to IBM PC

The only inexpensive product that I know of for handling Apple
diskettes under PCDOS/MSDOS is "Matchpoint" from Micro Solutions,
125 South 4th St., Dekalb, IL 60115, phone: (815) 756-3411.

This product is a half-size board that plugs into an IBM-PC and
comes with "Uniform" which is a general purpose disk format conversion
program.  According to the Micro Solutions sales representative,
"Matchpoint" can handle Apple DOS, ProDOS, Apple CP/M, and Northstar
CP/M.  List price is about $200. Contact Micro Solutions for
detailed information.

Xenosoft, Berkeley CA, may come out with a product in the future
to go with their Xenocopy PC software product. Nothing is
available from them at this time.

Vertex Systems, Los Angeles CA, is no longer in business.
Their telephone is disconnected. And I have verified with two
of there competitors that they are doing business with the
general public.

Sb: A Z-SYSTEM Testimonial 
Fm: Peter O.E. Bekker 74106,1430
To: All

I have just now emerged from 10 grueling hours worth of eye-crossing 
(glossing) installation work - but am proud to report the SUCCESSFUL 
implementation of ZCPR3 and Echelon's ZRDOS on a Kaypro 4-84.  In 
short, a fully functional Z-SYSTEM.

Without qualification I can say the Z-SYSTEM is a MAJOR boon to 8-bit 
computing.

Rick Conn, Joe Wright and the folks at ECHELON are quite definately 
pioneers who have picked-up the ball from Digital Research and run with 
it...far beyond the goal post.  (At first blush this would seem silly -
who would want to run much past the goal post? That's probably what DRI 
asked itself..lo those many years ago.) Well - had DRI only answered 
its own question with the same kind of vision that made it famous in 
the first place, BIG BLUE and its conspirators might not have muscled 
it out of prominence so quickly and completely .. but I digress.

Initial "interfaces" with the Z-SYSTEM have shown a TREMENDOUS 
improvement over CP/M..most particularly in the areas of "friendliness" 
and functionality.  (It's MS/PC-DOS .. for those of us who don't much 
care for the EXPENSE of 16-bit computing.)

While I'd like to babble on & on about Z-SYSTEM - I can't..lest someone 
get the idea I'm enthusiatic about it..or (perish the thought) suspect 
I have an equity interest in the distributor.  (Wish I did.)

But to demonstrate my serious intent - I am preparing a comprehensive 
DOC file for installation of Z-SYSTEM on a KAYPRO 4-84 (for my own 
records) and will be more than happy to post it here should anyone 
express even the slightest interest.  It's not a breeze by any means 
but, when all is said & done, it is well worth the effort.  To 
paraphrase a once obscure music critic named Jon Landau who several 
years ago sat through a Bruce Springsteen performance at a small Boston 
club.. "I have seen the future of 8-bit computing.. and its name is
Z-SYSTEM."

Is there any HARDWARE installation required with ZRDOS or is it 
strictly software?  There must be alot of disk space required just for 
the system files - do you really feel the advantages of the system 
outweigh the disk space required?  I can see it on a hard disk system, 
but am less convinced with floppies.

You're right.  ZSYSTEM is a MUCH more noticeable boon on hard disks 
than floppies.  But there are considerable advantages on the smaller 
drives too.

As for file space..I've enjoyed a GAIN using ZSYSTEM.  First of all, 
ZRDOS is a direct BDOS replacement and takes up no more space than a 
machine's stock BDOS (even though it contains several significant BDOS 
enhancements.

Using ZCPR3, I no longer keep PIP or STAT on most disks, saving 14k 
right there.  Z3, as you know, has CPY and PROT to do most of the 
things PIP & STAT do.  The REQUIRED Z3 files that every disk should 
have are ENV (the environment), LDR (to load the environment..and other 
things) and RCP (the Resident Command Package.) They are 4k, 2k and 2k 
respectively.  So you see -by removing PIP & STAT (14k) I've freed-up 
8k of space per disk since the ZCPR3 residents total only 8k.

No hardware changes of any kind are required.  ZSYSTEM is strictly an 
operating system change...but as I mentioned to Charlie, I've just now 
gotten it running and will be reporting back periodically as advantages 
and disadvantages are observed.  I must say, though, that throughout 
the installation process, it became clear to me that ZSYSTEM is an 
intriguing and damn clever implementation.

The ZRDOS advantages that come immediately to mind are the extended 
function calls you'd heard about.  These include calls to set and reset 
a warm boot trap - a call to GET the current DMA.....ZRDOS also 
supports file archiving and wheel protection...You even get a DELETE 
key that works for command line editing since ZRDOS eliminates the 
troublesome ^R function.

The BIG convenience, of course, is AUTO DISK LOGGING (just like MS-DOS)
no more repetative ^C's each time a disk is changed..just take one out, 
put another one in .. and go.  The error messages are a lot friendlier 
(and more informative) too.

ZRDOS directly answers the complaints of those who say CP/M is too 
"unfriendly" to gain wider accpetance.  And for programmers, it's a 
dream come true..particularly teamed with ZCPR3.

Haven't benchmarked..not really set up for it.  ZRDOS is written in Z80 
so it's got to be a little faster that CP/M..though because of disk 
access slowdowns, probably not noticeably so.  But I guess a Ramdisk 
check could be made.

As for the vast CP/M 80 domain of programs..no reason why they can't be 
run under ZRDOS...

But I've just now gotten this running and I'll report periodically to 
the membership on what I find.

Since ZRDOS is primarily a straight BDOS replacement, I will be 
concentrating [on writing] mostly (and in excruciating detail) on the 
installation of ZCPR3 in the K4-84. Included will be memory locations, 
sizes and uses...cold start patches for the BIOS, a change to lower the 
BDOS, a warm start patch to protect the CPR, step-by-step instruction 
on intstalling ZCPR3's main functions (ie External Path, Wheel Byte, 
Multiple Command Buffer.....in short, all the info I've been UNABLE to 
locate in the many ZCPR3 DOCs I've read.)

I hope to list all this info in such a way that even a total dolt such 
as myself would be able to make sense of it and even get Z-SYSTEM 
running while reading it.

Thanks to all who told me about this great TYPEing program.  It does
have one problem, at least on my system, though.  If you try to
specify a file from JCL, it demands that you specify the drive
explicitly.  If you wait until it drops you into its own processor
(with the "*" prompt), then everything is fine.


Am I screwing up, or is this a real bug?

Tnx.

<----------->

I have used the new USENET<->SIMTEL access method (thanks!), and have fetched
ccp104p.lbr.  This is an enhanced and Z80'd  CCP for CP/M 3.x .  I have
taken this and enhanced it.  My enhancements include:

	1.  Implemented a Unix-csh style of history mechanism (storing
	    quasi-conditionally the last 40 commands).  Actually it works a
	    bit better than csh.  For instance, just after substitution, you
	    are passed to the CP/M command line mini-editor.  The csh
	    "history" command is made a built-in "h" command.

	2.  Implemented a mechanism for easy further enhancement by HLL
	    means.  I think I may want to implement aliases next.  No more
	    of this assembly coding, I thought I gave that up.... :-)

	3.  I have made a small change that allows my CP/M "port" of the
	    Neil Russell "make" work properly when using the option that
	    stops-the-make when a make-step posts an error code.

	    (I posted this "make" to net.micro.cpm a while back, and so
	    perhaps I can be blamed for the ruckus that insued -- I had
	    also posted a CP/M port of a shar/unshar program).

Note that:

	a.) My "enhancements" are defeatable by conditional assembly flags
	    in the header.

	b.) It remains "under 4K" which is the limit on my system without
	    having to do anything tricky (although I *do* have my CP/M 3.0
	    build-disk under "make"...).

	c.) I also wrote a couple "c" utilities to get/put the CCP on the
	    system-track of my floppies (making "installation" trivial).
	    These would have to be modified for other people's machines,
	    but they may be useful starting points assuming you know where
	    your ccp lives.

	d.) I've labeled my version "1.04K"


My QUESTION is this:  In a week or two, after having tested this new CCP
		      a bit more than I have so far, I'd like to distribute
		      this back to SIMTEL in return for what I received.
		      HOW DO I DO THIS?  or: Does anyone really want CP/M
		      enhancements anymore now-days?

QUADRAM came out with a product called the QUADLINK a few years ago. It
consists of a board which you plug into your IBM PC and some software,
part of which runs in PC mode, some of which you can boot in Apple mode
to use for copying files. Unfortunately, I had to copy from Apple CP/M
to IBM PC format, so I first had to find a program to copy to Apple DOS
from CP/M. I managed to find what I hope is a public domain program on
a disk which someone had given me (it's called CPMXFR), and after figuring
out how to use it without any documentation, I managed to get it to convert
my files to Apple DOS. Then, I got the PC booted in Apple mode running this
thing they call the "Filer" and copied them to IBM PC format. It wasn't fun,
but it worked just fine.

  They list the computer itself, the 120K ramdisk unit, the multi-unit
(64k ramdisk, 300-baud modem, extra rom port), the 3.5 inch disk
drive, and some software.  They are pushing a package of the computer,
the multi-unit, and a printer for $699, which is VERY good.

  For those unfamiliar with the px-8, it's a battery operated laptop with
lcd 80x8 screen (implemented as a window over a 24x80 buffer, so normal
software will run).  Weighs maybe 5 pounds, fits into a briefcase along
with other stuff.  And it runs cp/m, so it's easy to develope software 
for it, and there's lots of commercial and pd stuff available.

I have used the Nevada Fortran compiler on a CP/M system
and was pretty satisfied that I got my $30 worth.  The Utah
compilers run on MS-DOS machines.  Both series are sold by
Ellis Computing.

The Fortran compiler generated so-so code using BCD
internal number representation.  The result was then linked
with a ~25 Kbyte runtime module which contained all of the
library functions (even if your program didn't call them).

I only wrote one moderate sized program with it.  In the
process I found no bugs.  The manual was clear and also
free of bugs.

If you want an inexpensive way to learn a language, the
Ellis products are probably a good way to go.  I would not
recommend them for large software products.

There is a board that plugs into a PC compatible and can read/write
Apple ][, //, //e, and Pro-DOS disk formats.  It also reads/writes
MS-DOS formats.  It allows you to format disks for the Apple while on
the PC and works with a multi-floppy or single floppy with hard drive
PC.  It can be configured to process the end of line string on one
format so the other can use the file, to process the end of file
marker, and to set up defaults for how/where the files are stored.
The configuration is saved in a file on disk, so you can load
different files for Pro-DOS and Apple-DOS.

The office across from mine uses one regularly on a Tandy 1200HD.
They say it works as advertised.  I helped the guy install it, and
it's relatively simple.  I think it takes a half-size slot, but it may
be a full-size one (?).  It connects into your floppy controller I
believe.  It doesn't interfere with any normal disk activity.  It only
goes active when you run the supplied software for it.  With the card,
you can transfer files both ways either singly or by the disk.  It
also can give a directory for Apple or PC disks.  The card gets a real
workout, and I don't think they've had any trouble with it.  I don't
know the manufacturer, but the product is "The Apple Turnover Card."
If you are interested, I can find the manufacturers name.  Just send
me mail if you want it.

Hope this helps,

I enjoy your CP/M list, but would like to participate to some IBM PC
discussions as well. I can only get partial information from our belgian
EARN central node. Could someone help me find the way to a good mailing list?
I've tried INFO-IBMPC-REQUEST@USC-ISIB.ARPA but got no mail from them but
a kind reply each time I subscribed.
I also heard of INFO-IBMPC@B.ISI.EDU, is it the same?
Also of net.micro.pc, same again?
Or is there anything else on Arpa or other nets?
Please note that I only have mail access to Arpanet (no FTP from BITNET).
This is why I take the opportunity to publicly thank Frank Wancho at
SIMTEL20 and others for the help in setting up servers.

Has anybody "standardized" BDS C?


I have been working (playing) with a BDS C compiler lately, and have 
been subjected to a number of annoyances related to its non-standard
I/O routines which carry standard names, such as fopen().

A few years back somebody wrote a set of routines, sfopen() et al, 
that work like the "real" thing. I expanded and incorporated those into
"my" libraries, but there is still the problem of finding and changing
names in p/d programs to be compiled with BDS C.

I would like to reorganize the standard libraries so that the "new"
standard functions would work just like the "real" thing. A quick
survey shows the following routines (there may be others) to be
(possibly) nonstandard in some potentially critical way:

	puts()	getline()?
	open()	creat()	read()	write()	seek()?	tell()?
	fopen()	fgets()?

If anybody has done this before (or knows of it being done), I would
appreciate sources, pointers, or hints.

Andre - Here is a 144kb listing of all the interest groups.  Your
guess about isib and b.isi is correct.  The new domain naming convention
is the b.isi.  The difference between info-ibmpc and info-ibmpc-request
is that request is the address used to get on the list.  Your return
address of UZ32112%BLIULG12.BITNET@WISCVM.WISC.EDU is correct.
All I can suggest is that you can try sending a request to the request
address and ask for confirmation of your request to be added to the list.

I'll send the two most recent info-ibmpc digests as separate notes.

HUMAN-NETS@RED.RUTGERS.EDU

   Mailing list originally consisting of the combined memberships of 
   INFO-PCNET, HOME-SAT, and TELETEXT mailing lists.  Human-Nets has discussed 
   many topics, all of them related in some way to the theme of a world-wide 
   computer and telecommunications network usually called WorldNet.  The topics
   have ranged very widely, from something like tutorials, to state of the art 
   discussions, to rampant speculation about technology and its impact.  The 
   list is extremely large, making it necessary to batch messages sent to the 
   list and distributing them once each day during off peak periods to avoid 
   overloading the system.

   The permanent archives contain all of the material distributed to the list. 
   Due to size, this archive is broken down into several different files, 
   stored in reverse temporal order.  The files are currently stored on ARPANet
   host RU-BLUE in files RHYTHM:<PLEASANT.HUMAN-NETS>HUMNET.* (where "*" is a 
   wild-card).

   All requests to be added to or deleted from this list, problems, questions, 
   etc., should be sent to HUMAN-NETS-REQUEST@RUTGERS.

INFO-1100@SUMEX-AIM.STANFORD.EDU
BUG-1100@SUMEX-AIM.STANFORD.EDU

   These discussion lists focus on Xerox 1100 workstations (1100, 1108, 1132, 
   1185, 1186) and protocols.  Their purpose is to stimulate communication and 
   sharing between computer science research groups that are using or are 
   interested in these machines.

   Info-1100 is the "information channel" where messages such as announcements 
   of available lispusers packages may be made or for queries such as "Does 
   anybody know of a PUP file server implementation for the Sinclair ZX-80?".  
   It is intended to be a low-volume list suitable for the casual reader.  
   Bug-1100 is the "bug channel" where readers can warn others of Interlisp-D 
   bugs and/or suggest workarounds or solicit help or discussion; it is 
   expected to have greater volume than Info-1100, being for the hard-core 
   user.  Since hard-core users read both lists, Bug-1100 is a subset of 
   Info-1100 and there is never a need to send to both lists.

   Xerox PARC, SIS, and AIS people are included in the distribution list to 
   facilitate communication about new developments, bugs, performance issues, 
   etc..  Additionally, Info-1100 and Bug-1100 are automatically forwarded to 
   AISupport.pasa@Xerox, where bugs are noted and acted upon if appropriate. 
   Xerox AIS employees will not respond in Bug-1100 unless the reply is of 
   general interest or silence would mislead the readership.

   Archives of messages are kept on SUMEX-AIM in files:
      <BBOARD>INFO-1100.TXT      <BBOARD>BUG-1100.TXT
   Some net-contributed lispusers packages, updates, and patches are kept on 
   SUMEX-AIM in files:
      <LISPUSERS.INTERMEZZO>      <LISPUSERS.KOTO>      etc.

   Requests to be added to or deleted from these lists, problems, questions, 
   etc. should be sent to Info-1100-Request@SUMEX-AIM.STANFORD.EDU or 
   Bug-1100-Request@SUMEX-AIM.STANFORD.EDU.

INFO-FUTURES%BU-CS@CSNet-Relay.ARPA
      INFO-FUTURES@BU-CS (CSNET)
      ...harvard!bu-cs!info-futures (UUCP)

   Digest to provide a speculative forum for analyzing current and likely 
   events in technology as they will affect our near future in computing and 
   related areas.  In broad terms, topics of interest include developments in 
   both computing research and industry which are likely to affect our decision
   making, particularly decisions we are probably grappling with right this 
   minute.  Technologies can change so rapidly that simply forecasting for 
   needs within any organization one or two years in advance can be extremely 
   difficult, frequently we are forced to provide foundations that effectively 
   lock us into a technology for longer periods of time. It is hoped the 
   information this list provides can help both the practitioner and researcher
   determine where best to expend resources.

INFO-IBMPC@USC-ISIB

   Info-IBMPC is a forum for technical discussion of the IBM Personal Computer 
   and compatible micro-computers, providing a way for interested members of 
   the ARPANET community to compare notes, ask questions, and share insights of
   a technical nature about these machines.  While it is not primarily a 
   consumer's guide to the IBM PC, the digest may also be useful for that 
   purpose.

   Messages are collected, edited into digests and distributed as the volume of
   mail dictates (generally twice a week).  All messages of a technical nature 
   about IBM PCs are welcomed; messages about other topics will not be run.  In
   addition, two topics are taboo and are routinely edited out: (1) self 
   promotion of products for sale, and (2) anything about copy protection.

   Recent digests are archived on USC-ISIB in <INFO-IBMPC>DIGESTS-85. Older 
   digests are archived by quarter in the following files:

      Q1-DIGESTS-85   ; V4 # 1-40 [too big for mm, use hermes]
      Q4-DIGESTS-84   ; V3 # 91-119

      Q1-DIGESTS-83   ; V2 # 1-19
      Q34-DIGESTS-82  ; V1 # 1-34

      These files can be read by MM, HERMES, and other TOPS20 mail systems. 
      KWIC-INDEX.TXT contains a key-word-in-context index to digest articles.  
      TOC.???85 contains a table of contents for the month ???. These files may
      be FTP'ed to any Arpanet/Milnet host from [USC-ISIB]<INFO-IBMPC> by 
      logging in within FTP using username ANONYMOUS, password GUEST.  If 
      you're not directly on the Arpanet the files can be mailed to you, 
      although there is a limit to the length of a message.

   A library of free software is maintained in [USC-ISIB]<INFO-IBMPC>.  The 
   list of available programs is in <INFO-IBMPC>PROGRAM-LIBRARY.LIST. Donations
   of source code are eagerly welcomed (even trivial programs). Donated 
   programs must be truly free, with no fee or contribution required or 
   requested.  To donate a program to the library, send a description of the

INFO-KERMIT@CU20B

   Kermit is a file transfer protocol for use primarily between micros and 
   mainframes over TTY lines, and is implemented on a wide variety of both. The
   Info-Kermit mailing list is a digest intended for people who maintain or 
   install Kermit at their sites, or who are (thinking about) working on a new 
   implementation, or who have bugs and/or fixes to report, or who are 
   interested in discussing the protocol; it is available on Internet, CSnet, 
   Mailnet, BITnet, Usenet, CCnet, and any other network gatewayed to the 
   Internet.

   All the Kermit files are on CU20B in the area "KER:" or "K2:".  The file 
   KER:AAAREAD.ME contains information on what files are in the Kermit 
   distribution area and how to find them.  One file worth checking from time 
   to time is KER:AAVNEW.HLP, a brief tabular listing of each existing version 
   of Kermit, showing the version number and date of the latest release of each
   version.  The file KER:AANETW.HLP lists in detail the procedures for 
   obtaining Kermit files via network.

   Kermit files, including program source and documentation, are available as 
   follows:

      Internet: anonymous FTP from host CU20B, area KER: or K2:, 24 hours a 
      day, 7 days a week.

      BITnet: from the KERMSRV server at host CUVMA; type SMSG RSCS MSG CUVMA 
      KERMSRV HELP for further information.

      UUCP: from Oklahoma State University (host okstate) in Stillwater, OK. 
      Mail to uucp-support%okstate@CSNET-RELAY for further information. 
      Selected sources (usually Unix-related) are posted to net.sources from 
      time to time.

      CCNET: DECnet NFT from host CU20B.  Anonymous NFT connections are not 
      permitted from all hosts, so file transfers must be made by system 
      managers or programmers who have access to CU20B.

      U.S. Mail: send requests for information to:

         Kermit Distribution
         Columbia University Center for Computing Activities
         612 West 115 Street
         New York, NY  10025

   Info-Kermit mail was direct up until May 23, 1984, when it became a digest. 
   The pre-digest messages are in KER:MAIL.83A and KER:MAIL.84A.  Volume 1 of 
   the digest is in KER:MAIL.84B.  The current, active digest is in 
   KER:MAIL.TXT.  From time to time, active digests will be retired to files 
   with names like KER:MAIL.85A, KER:MAIL.85B, and so on.

   All requests to be added to or deleted from this list, problems, questions, 
   etc., should be sent to INFO-KERMIT-REQUEST@CU20B.  If your host does not 
   support long names in mail addesses, then just send to KERMIT@CU20B.

INFO-MICRO@BRL

   Information/discussion list on the general interest topic of microcomputers.

   Questions/discussions on a particular Operating System, such as CP/M, should
   be addressed to the specific list if one already exists (such as 
   INFO-CPM@MC.LCS.MIT.EDU (or @BRL) for this example).

   Archives of recent correspondence are kept on SIMTEL20 in several files:

      "PS:<ARCHIVES.MICRO>MICRO.ARCHIV.ymmdd"  is a group of files containing 
      correspondence going back several years.  The characters "ymmdd" in the 
      file names are actually digits giving the year, month and day of the last
      message in each particular file.  "PS:<ARCHIVES.MICRO>MICRO-ARCHIV.TXT" 
      contains a growing archive of current correspondence.

      Over 80 megabytes of public domain software (most of it CP/M) are kept in
      five program archives on SIMTEL20.  For a description of these archives, 
      request a copy of the "archive blurb" from INFO-CPM-REQUEST@AMSAA.  All 
      correspondence and program archives described here are available to

   separate compilation with a module (compilation unit) broken into 
   specification and implementation parts with importing and exporting of 
   objects, controlled machine level access, and concurrent programming and 
   coroutines.  Modula-2 has most of the power of Ada but is small enough that 
   excellent full implementations exist for CP/M 80.

   Mail archives are stored on SIMTEL20 in file:
      <ARCHIVES.MODULA-2>MODULA-2-ARCHIV.TXT
   They are available via ANONYMOUS FTP from SIMTEL20 for those with TCP/IP

INFO-PCNET@MC.LCS.MIT.EDU

   INFO-PCNET is a general mailing list to keep interested people advised of 
   major developments.

   PCNET is a volunteer effort creating a computer network for personal use. 
   Although meant to be device independent, the current design is oriented to 
   use through the telephone system, particularly by computers with automatic 
   dialing and receipt of calls.  PCNET will enable all computer users, whether
   part of a formal network organization or individual owners of personal 
   computers, to communicate with each other effectively.  PCNET is defining 
   communication protocols that assure that transmissions are correct 
   (retransmitting data that is lost or erroneous), and which allow multiple 
   logical data streams so that several programs can share a single hardware 
   communication link.  PCNET has defined a worldwide addressing standard that 
   permits automatic forwarding of messages and files without having to know 
   the topology of the network.

   PCNET is currently finising software on several machines (8080, 6502, 
   PDP-10) using several languages (Assembly language, LISP, C), and refining 
   the documentation; volunteer communications programmers are needed to 
   complete these tasks.

   The PCNET files are on SIMTEL20 in directory PD:<PCNET>.  SIMTEL20 supports 
   ANONYMOUS login within FTP them using any non-null password.

   All requests to be added to or deleted from this list, problems, questions, 
   etc., should be sent to INFO-PCNET-REQUEST@MC.LCS.MIT.EDU.

INFO-TMODEM@SIMTEL20.ARPA
BUG-TMODEM@SIMTEL20.ARPA

   The INFO-TMODEM list is a means for the maintainer of the TMODEM program to 
   send notices to users of TMODEM.  Users of TMODEM send bug reports and 
   feature requests to BUG-TMODEM@SIMTEL20.

   TMODEM is a new TOPS-20 implementation of the Christensen Protocol, with all
   the latest features, such as:
      o  wildcard file transfers in the style of MODEM7
         (YMODEM batch is coming)
      o  the YMODEM implementation of the K option with a new algorithm
         to return to K mode after falling back to "normal" mode
      o  extensive built-in HELP for all commands and options.
   TMODEM is an amalgamation of the old TOPS-20 MODEM program, originally 
   written by Bill Westfield while he was at SRI and now at Stanford, major 
   pieces of the TOPS-20 TELNET program, currently maintained by Mark Crispin, 
   and some pieces of code stolen from TTLINK and KERMIT-20 by Frank da Cruz at
   Columbia University.

   The archives for replaced mailing list INFO-MODEMXX are frozen in 
   <ARCHIVES.MODEMXX> on SIMTEL20.  A new set of archives for INFO-TMODEM is on
   SIMTEL20 in <ARCHIVES.TMODEM>TMODEM-ARCHIV.TXT.  The source for TMODEM is in
   TOPS-20:TMODEM.MAC, and must be compiled for each individual TOPS-20 system 
   environment.

   The only real boundaries to the discussion are defined by the topics of 
   other mailing lists.  Please do not send communications to both this list 
   and AIList or the Prolog list, except in special cases.

   Please "sign" subscriptions with full name and address so that people can 
   access you from Internet and/or BITNET (many other networks can be reached 
   through them and are certainly urged to participate).

   There is no objection to distributing material that is destined for 
   conference proceedings or any other publication.  The Coordinator is 
   involved in SIGIR Forum and, unless submittors request otherwise, may 
   include submissions in whole or in part in future paper versions of the 
   FORUM.  Indeed, this is one form of solicitation for FORUM contributions!  
   Both IRList and the FORUM are unrefereed, and opinions are always those of 
   the author and not of any organization unless there are other indications.  
   Copies of list items should credit the original author, not necessarily the 
   IRList.

   Archival copies of all digests will be kept; feel free to ask IRList-Request
   for recent back issues.  Note that FTP is not possible, so all communication
   must be by EMAIL, phone, or letter.

LIST OF MAILING LISTS

   Mailing-list for "List of lists" update notices.

   There is a master list of ARPANET mailing-lists/digests/discussion groups 
   (~140 lists/2600+ lines/120,000+ characters) on SRI-NIC in files:
      NETINFO:INTEREST-GROUPS-1.TXT  (first half of the list)
      NETINFO:INTEREST-GROUPS-2.TXT  (second half of the list)
      For ARPANET users, SRI-NIC supports the net-standard ANONYMOUS
      login within FTP, with any password.

   To keep people up to date on the large number of such lists, there is a 
   mailing-list for list-of-lists \update notices/.  Copies of the list itself 
   are not sent to the world at large, but for those ARPANET users who 
   seriously intend to FTP the updated versions when updated, a brief notice 
   will be sent when a new version is available.  For those liaisons at 
   internet sites who maintain or redistribute copies for their own networks 
   (DECNet, Xerox, BitNet, MailNet, etc.) and can't reach the master by ARPANET
   FTP, the complete new file will be sent if necessary.  File copies will not 
   normally be sent to individual users, either ARPANET or internet.

   To get on the list (or to submit updates to existing mailing-lists or add 
   new ones), send requests to Rich Zellich <ZELLICH@SRI-NIC.ARPA>

Love-Hounds@MIT-Eddie

   feminism is generally viewed as a good thing on this list.  This mailing 
   list is digested as a kindness to various mail systems.

   All requests to be added to or deleted from this list, problems, questions, 
   etc., should be sent to MAIL-MEN-REQUEST@ROCHESTER.

MHS_(X.400)_Implementation%QZCOM@MIT-MULTICS.ARPA
MHS_IMPLEMENTATION@RSCH.WISC.EDU
MHS_implementation@EAN.UBC.CDN

   A QZCOM conference with the name "MHS (X.400) implementation"; the 
   conference will have the name "MHS_(X.400)_implementation" for mail 
   networks, in most cases postfixed  by "%QZCOM@MIT-MULTICS.ARPA".  The 
   conference/mailing list is open to anyone who is seriously interested in  
   implementing the CCITT X.400 (MHS) message handling protocols or gateways to
   these protocols.  The conference/mailing list can discuss such things as how
   to understand and interpret the MHS recommendation, how to map existing mail
   system and mail network features onto the MHS structure etc.

   To minimize international communications costs, separate distribution lists 
   for CSNET/ARPANET and CDNNET users are being maintained at UWISC and UBC 
   respectively.  ARPANET and CSNET users should send messages to 
   MHS_IMPLEMENTATION@WISC-RSCH.  CDNNET users should send messages to 
   MHS_IMPLEMENTATION@EAN.UBC.CDN.  Messages sent to one of the lists will be 
   forwarded to members of the other lists.

      QZCOM users:
         Use the "member" command.
      ARPANET/CSNET users:
         Send a message to  MHS_IMPLEMENTATION-REQUEST@RSCH.WISC.EDU
      CDNNET users:
         Send a message to MHS_IMPLEMENTATION-REQUEST@EAN.UBC.CDN
      Users at other sites:
         Send a message to "Jacob_Palme_QZ%QZCOM.MAILNET@MIT-MULTICS.ARPA",

   The Music-Research electronic mail redistribution list was established after
   a suggestion made at a meeting in Oxford in July 1986, to provide an 
   effective and fast means of bringing together musicologists, music analysts,
   computer scientists, and others working on applications of computers in 
   music research.  Initially, the list was established for people whose chief 
   interests concern computers and their applications to

      - music representation systems
      - information retrieval systems for musical scores
      - music printing
      - music analysis
      - musicology and ethnomusicology
      - tertiary music education
      - databases of musical information

   The following areas are not the principal concern of this list, although 
   overlapping subjects may well be interesting:

      - primary and secondary education
      - sound generation techniques
      - composition

   All requests to be added to or deleted from this list, problems, questions, 
   etc., should be sent to music-research-request%prg.oxford.ac.uk@CS.UCL.AC.UK
   or UUCP  ...!ukc!ox-prg!music-research-request.

NA@SU-SCORE

   Numerical Analysis mailing-list.

   Moderator: Gene Golub <GOLUB@SU-SCORE>

NAMEDROPPERS@SRI-NIC.ARPA

   The NAMEDROPPERS mailing list is to be used for discussion of the concepts, 
   principles, design, and implementation of the domain style names.  The main 
   focus of this group is the review of documents describing domain style 
   names.  This is a list for participants in a discussion, not observers.  
   Everyone on the list is expected to contribute from time to time.

   Nearly everyone in NAMEDROPPERS is also on HEADER-PEOPLE and also on 
   MSGGROUP.  There is no need to send a message to both NAMEDROPPERS and 
   either of these lists (and certianly not both!).

   All of the previous NAMEDROPPERS discussion can be found in SRI-NIC files
      <NAMSER>NAMEDROPPERS.198X
   where X is the number of the year of the archive you are looking for.  A/O 
   Jan 85, there are archives for 1983, 1984 and 1985.  
   <NAMSER>NAMEDROPPERS.MAIL still contains the most current NAMEDROPPERS 
   dialog.  These files can be accessed via anonymous FTP; new members may wish
   to copy and read these archives before joining the discussion.

   All requests to be added to or deleted from this list, problems, questions, 
   etc., should be sent to NAMEDROPPERS-REQUEST@SRI-NIC.

   Coordinator: Ann Westine <WESTINE@USC-ISIB.ARPA>

NIHONGO@MC.LCS.MIT.EDU

   For discussion of the Japanese language, including both spoken and written 
   forms.  Also see the entry for the INFO-JAPAN mailing list.

   The complete archives are publicly accessible by FTP from host MIT-MC, which
   uses the ITS operating system.  Case is not significant, but the space after
   "NIHON" is.  The archives are in:  COMAIL;NIHON GO

   All requests to be added to or deleted from this list, problems, questions, 
   etc., should be sent to NIHONGO-REQUEST@MC.LCS.MIT.EDU.

NL-KR@ROCHESTER.ARPA

   NL-KR is open to discussion of any topic related to the natural language 
   (both understanding and generation) and knowledge representation, both as 
   subfields of AI.  The Moderator's interests are primarily in:

      Knowledge Representation    Natural Language Understanding
      Discourse Understanding     Philosophy of Language
      Plan Recognition            Computational Linguistics

   Contributions are also welcome on topics such as:

      Cognitive Psychology (as related to NL/KR)
      Human Perception (same)
      Linguistics
      Machine Translation
      Computer and Information Science (as may be used to implement various
      Logic Programming (same)                                   NL systems)

   Contributions may be anything from tutorials to speculation. In particular, 
   the following are sought:

      Abstracts                             Reviews
      Lab Descriptions                      Research Overviews
      Work Planned or in Progress           Half-Baked Ideas
      Conference Announcements              Conference Reports
      Bibliographies                        History of NL/KR
      Puzzles and Unsolved Problems         Anecdotes, Jokes, and Poems
      Queries and Requests                  Address Changes (Bindings)

   This list is in some sense a spin-off of the AIList, and as such, a certain 
   amount of overlap is expected. The primary concentration of this list should
   be NL and KR, that is, natural language (be it understanding, generation, 
   recognition, parsing, semantics, pragmatics, etc.) and how we should 
   represent knowledge (aquisition, access, completeness, etc. are all valid 
   issues).  Topics deemed to be outside the general scope of this list will be
   forwarded to AIList (or other more appropriate list) or rejected.

   Archival copies of all digests will be kept; feel free to ask NL-KR-REQUEST 
   for recent back issues.

   All requests to be added to or deleted from this list, problems, questions, 
   etc., should be sent to NL-KR-REQUEST@ROCHESTER.ARPA.

POLI-SCI@RUTGERS

   POLI-SCI is a spinoff from the HUMAN-NETS discussion list.  Shortly after 
   the November 1980 election, HUMAN-NETS began to discuss the impact that 
   electronic communications had on the election.  As this discussion 
   continued, it lost its narrow focus on electronic communications and began 
   to consider the election in general, how elections are won and lost, and the
   nature of the electoral college.  The growth of these discussions, and their
   spawning of related discussions, indicated that a separate discussion list 
   was merited and POLI-SCI was installed.  Since then POLI-SCI has begun to 
   consider other topics including the history of the Carter and Nixon 
   presidencies, the Iranian hostage crisis, etc. (with a little less dignity, 
   the list might be characterized as a permanent distributed political bull 
   session).

   Archived digest messages are stored on RUTGERS in:
      <poli-sci>mail.txt
      and other files in the <poli-sci> directory

   All requests to be added to or deleted from this list, problems, questions,

PROLOG[-HACKERS]@SU-SCORE

   Prolog and logic programming mailing lists.

   Some of the people answering the initial BBoard message stated that they 
   would be interested in general Prolog and logic programming information, but
   not in the nitty-gritty details of Prolog systems and their bugs. Therefore,
   two mailing lists have been set up, PROLOG and PROLOG-HACKERS: PROLOG will 
   provide a digest of articles of general interest; PROLOG-HACKERS will 
   provide a direct mailing for the nasty stuff.  Finally, PROLOG-REQUEST 
   should be used for distribution requests.  In a nutshell:

      Mail to                 for
      -------                 ---

      PROLOG@SCORE            sending articles of general interest 
      PROLOG-HACKERS@SCORE    sending articles of limited interest 
      PROLOG-REQUEST@SCORE    getting in and out of the mailing lists
                               and other bureaucracy

   Please do not send the same message to PROLOG and PROLOG-HACKERS.  Messages 
   will be moved between lists if appropriate.

   An archive of the USEnet prolog interest group interchange can be FTP'd from
   host SU-SCORE using standard anonymous login convention.  The pathname is:
      PS:<PROLOG>UPIG.ARCHIVE

   Moderator: Chuck Restivo <RESTIVO@SU-SCORE.ARPA>

ProtocolS@RUTGERS

   This list is designed to promote discussion of the various existing FTP 
   protocols for async-ascii-serial-lines and any kind of computer/OS.  The 
   eventual goal is to devise (and implement) an all-purpose standard protocol 
   for FTP.

   Message log/archives are kept at RUTGERS in files:
      PS:<PLEASANT.PROTOCOL>PROTOCOLS.OLD     Pre-digest to 30 Mar 82
      PS:<PLEASANT.PROTOCOL>PROTOCOLS.RECENT  Digest 30 Mar 82 to present

Psychnet <EPSYNET%UHUPVM1.BITNET@WISCVM.WISC.EDU>

   PSYCHNET (tm) is a psychology Newsletter and mailing list, sending out 
   information, news, and academic papers to those who sign up.  An initial 
   formal purpose of Psychnet is distribution of academic papers in advance of 
   the 1986 APA convention; other purposes will develop according to the needs 
   and interests of the profession and Psychnet users.

   Outside BitNet, Psychnet is a Newsletter and mailing list only.  Once per 
   week, members receive the latest Psychnet Newsletter and Index of files 
   available on the server machine.  If a file looks interesting send an E-mail
   request to EPSYNET%UHUPVM1.BITNET@WISCVM.WISC.EDU and the file will be sent 
   to you.

   Within BitNet, Psychnet is also a 24-hour server machine which mails out 
   files to users who first send the PSYCHNET HELP command to userid UH-INFO at
   node UHUPVM1 (*NOT* to userid EPSYNET).  Persons within BitNet may also sign
   up for the mailing list and will get the Newsletter and Index along with 
   other news.  BitNet users, however, should get their files directly from the
   server machine; an Exec file is available for CMS users and COM files are 
   available for VAX users within BitNet.

   To have a file or idea distributed to members of the list send it to the 
   primary list address and it will be sent out, usually with the week's 
   Psychnet Newsletter.

   All requests to be added to or deleted from the mailing list, or to have 
   files distributed should be sent to EPSYNET%UHUPVM1.BITNET@WISCVM.WISC.EDU.

   about Scribe features, bugs, enhancements, performance, support, and other 
   topics of interest to Scribe DBAs.  The list will NOT be moderated, but will
   simply consist of a mail "reflector" - ie. if you send a message to the 
   list, it will be rebroadcast to everyone on the list.  Discussion at the 
   level of "How do I get a paragraph to indent 5 spaces instead of 3?" is 
   specifically discouraged.

SECURITY@RUTGERS

   This list is designed to provide a forum for discussion of the field of 
   security in general, be it electronic, physical, or computer-related.  Since
   the original idea was to name this list LOCKSMITHS, discussions about 
   physical security and hardware are welcomed, but to broaden out into 
   computer security and electronic access control and such is also valid.  In 
   other words, any subject matter relating to the *improvement* and 
   *implementation* of security systems is okay, while how to *defeat* them is 
   not.  Messages are not digestified, but are filtered to keep things of 
   questionable legality/ content from escaping out to the network.

   All requests to be added to or deleted from this list, problems, questions, 
   etc., should be sent to SECURITY-REQUEST@RUTGERS.

SF-CONS LIST

   Mailing-List for SF Conventions listing update notices.

   There is a master SF cons list (averaging 1000-1500 lines or 55,000-75,000 
   characters, including geographic cross-reference) on SRI-NIC in file:
      <ZELLICH>CONS.TXT
   For ARPANET users, SRI-NIC supports the net-standard ANONYMOUS login within 
   FTP, with any password.

   In order to proliferate the list more quickly, there is a mailing list for 
   cons-list \update notices/.  Copies of the cons list itself are not sent to 
   the world at large, but for those ARPANET users who seriously intend to FTP 
   the updated versions every few weeks, a brief notice will be sent when a new
   version is available.  For those liaisons at internet sites who maintain or 
   redistribute copies for their own networks (DECNet, Xerox, BitNet, MailNet, 
   etc.), the complete new file will be sent out if necessary.  File copies 
   will \not/ be sent to individual users, either ARPANET or internet.

   Update notices/file copies can be expected approximately every 2nd or 3rd 
   month.  Sources of cons for the list are LOCUS, ANALOG, STARLOG, flyers 
   picked up at cons by local fen, and anything sent to the list maintainer.

   To get on the update-notices list (or to submit con updates), send messages 
   to Rich Zellich <ZELLICH@SRI-NIC.ARPA>.

SF-LOVERS@RED.RUTGERS.EDU

   Science Fiction lovers.  SF-LOVERS has discussed many topics, all of them 
   related in some way to the theme of science fiction or fantasy.  The topics 
   have ranged very widely from rewritten stories, bad SF movies, and SF 
   conventions to reviews of books and films.  The range of topics is quite 
   wide and anyone is welcome to submit material on these or other topics of 
   interest in this general area.

   The digest has a very large number of readers, and trivial messages are 
   strongly discouraged due to the heavy load SF-LOVERS puts on the hosts CPU 
   and disk space.  Messages to SF-LOVERS@RUTGERS are batched and broadcast 
   periodically.

   The SF-LOVERS archives are available on RUTGERS.  Each volume is contained 
   in its own file, with the contents ordered chronologically. The first 
   archive includes a number of messages from the early days before digests and
   there is much of "historical" interest.  At the end of that volume is a long
   discussion which took place during the Star Wars series craze.

      for checksumming purposes if you FTP the file.  Volume 11 is the current 
      volume A/O Jan 86.  Old issues can also be found at RUTGERS and are in 
      the files SF-LOVERS.xxx-yy where xxx is the month of publication and yy 
      is the current year.  The current month's messages may be found in

   local intelligent devices and a remote timesharing computer.  The software 
   being creating is an adventure game allowing multiple players.  Players may 
   be controlled by either human users or planning software.  The project is 
   potentially enormous and much paring of capabilities is expected.  The 
   primary goals of the project are:

      Error free communication protocol
      Simple control of local intelligent devices
      Centralized database with local caching of unchanging data objects
      Local processing of user commands (to offload central system)
      An adventure game

   This project is an offshoot of a locally funded research grant examining the
   interaction of local intelligent devices and remote timesharing systems.  
   Since January 1, 1984 we have been sponsored by the Rutgers Center for 
   Computer and Information Services.  We hope to produce software useful to 
   other members of the University computing community with this project.  Two 
   such pieces of software are a remote file access system, and a universal 
   window oriented terminal handler.

   The SMAuG group meets every Wednesday evening from 8pm until 10pm at Rutgers
   University in Hill Center room 318.  Hill Center is located on Busch Campus 
   in Piscataway, New Jersey.  Requests for detailed directions should be sent 
   to Fischer.PA@XEROX.ARPA.  If you are coming any distance to attend a 
   meeting please contact Fischer.PA@XEROX.ARPA, sometimes the meetings are 
   held elsewhere, and announcements of this are only distributed locally in 
   the Rutgers area. Your attendance is, however, very welcome!

   There is a separate mailing-list for SMAuG Storywriters: 
   SMAuG-Story^.X@Xerox.ARPA; archives for this list are available from 
   Fischer.PA@Xerox.ARPA.

   All requests to be added to or deleted from this list, back issue requests, 
   problems, questions, etc., should be sent to McGrew.Smaug@RU-BLUE.

   SIMTEL20 (probably monthly).

   UNIX-SW is not a forum for discussion of this software.  Such discussions 
   are more appropriately held with the authors, or in other groups.  Rather, 
   we are attempting to make known to the widest possible audience the contents
   of this large repository of public-domain software.

   SIMTEL20 is a DEC-20 machine running the TOPS20 operating system, located at
   White Sands Missile Range, New Mexico.  The machine is a host on the Defense
   Data Network (DDN), and as such, gives users located on other hosts the 
   capability of directly transferring this software via the FTP (file transfer
   process) command.

   Mail archives are stored on SIMTEL20 in file:

From what I hear, there should be a new version of BDS C comming out that
is supposed to be "more K&R compatible".  That could mean anything from
fixing the I/O routines to adding auto initialization.  One thing that
it is supposed to have is a float data type (about time!!).  You might
want to check with the author to see what he really is doing for the next
release before you take on any really big projects for overhauling the
existing BDS C.

I would be interested in finding a review of C compilers for the CP/M world.
A local reseller (buy cheep, sell high) has a few C compilers but I think she
may not know what she has..  Any suggestions for compilers I should save up
for?  Any news about Supersoft?

Also, any users out there with Montezume Micro's CP/M?  I have some questions
about it on my 4p.  According to Personal Computing +100,000 units were sold.

I tried to Unsqueeze PD:<CPM.WSTAR>WSKEY.DQC -> WSKEY.DOC on this here machine
and after a few pages i got "Premature end of file" from the Unsqueezer.
Question: can anyone send me a copy of WSKEY.DOC (unsqueezed).  Will get it
put back in PD:<CPM.WSTAR> correctly.

Thanks to all who respond, 	--Dick..

WSKEY.DQC was bad.  I replaced it temporarily with WSKEY.DOC,
extracted from WSKEY.LBR which is now there to consolidate the
files associated with that package.

EVERYONE: PLEASE NOTIFY ME WHEN YOU HAVE A PROBLEM WITH ANY FILES IN
THE SIMTEL20 ARCHIVES.  I have off-line backups for nearly everything
I have uploaded over the years.

I came up with a quick and dirty solution for the buffered i/o stuff via
defines and a small library.  It went something like this.  stdio.h for
bdsc is basically bdscio.h with some defines that map fopen to ufopen,
fclose to ufclose and so-on.  The library file (I called it unixio.c)
has the ufopen which uses malloc to get a buffer and bdsc's fopen to do
the actual open after parsing the mode field.  ufclose frees the buffer
and calls fclose.  The higher level calls are easily handled this way
but read/write/seek/tell will need a complete rewrite.  Seek and tell
really can't be done without longs anyway.  As long as your code sticks
to buffered i/o, this works fine and is easy to implement.  While you're
at it, put the whole malloc library in unixio and save yourself further
headaches.  The code in k&r will do.

Subject:  C128 CPM QUESTIONS

Hello All,
I have two questions.

1.  How can I speed up the printing process using Word Star and a C1526 
printer?  Please don't flame me for the printer the price was right a couple
of years ago.  Currently the printer receives a line, prints it, seems to 
think, receives another line, prints, ad infinitem.  Is there a way to 
install Word Star or the CPM + to tell it the printer has a buffer?  If so
how big is the buffer?

2.  Also how can I receive an update to the CPM + system to recognize the 
modem port without using a modem?  When I sent for the utility disks from 
Commodore (In January) I didn't get the updated version.  I have seen the 
update files in the simtel pd but have no way of getting them down.  I don't
have any friends with a C64 and cpm or any with a C128.  Any help would be
greatly appreciated.

Jim

I don't think you can.  The problem isn't the printer; it's the way WordStar
prints.  This is about my only beef with WordStar - I think it prints better 
than any other word processor, but it takes forever to do it.  I usually start 
WordStar printing and then go have a beer.  (I use it on an Apple //e.  Word-
Star, not the beer.)

Does anyone know where I can find the latest version of TVX?  TVX is
purported to be an EMACS-like editor available in the public domain.
I have an older version which someone adapted to the Commodore-128, but
it is more TECO-like than EMACS-like, and appears to be missing a lot
of the features I have seen attributed to TVX.

Thanks.

MMDF-Warning:  Parse error in preceding line at AMSAA.ARPA

In response to Mr. Fleig and Mr. Pierson:

1. I believe [SIMTEL20] PD:<MSDOS.TVX-EDITOR> is the latest (with EMACS
   emulation) version of TVX.  If not, it certainly is more recent than the
   C128 compatible version.  No doubt much fatter too.

2. Wordstar printing slowness on C128: It doesn't go slow on my 128 and
   printer.  I followed the recommendations on speedup in file [SIMTEL20]
   PD:<CPM.C128>WORDSTAR.IQF (squeezed).  Perhaps, elimination of the delays
   as indicated therein also helps the printer, I dunno.  But my Blue-Chip
   printer buffer (4K) gets filled up faster than it can empty.  It may have
   to do with the fact that Wordstar trys to service the printer while also
   letting you edit - cutting the editing delays down probably speeds up the
   printer.  Try the patches in WORDSTAR.IQF and see if they don't help.

3. New C128 BIOS.  The file [SIMTEL20] PD:<CPM.C128>C128-NEW.IRV contains the
   instructions for "getting it down", this assuming you have a modem and some
   software to transfer files (xmodem or kermit) from your host to the 128 in
   either 128 or 64 mode.  If you don't have this, you're not ready for
   running a modem from CP/M anyway.

Hello -

     I would appreciate hearing from someone as to the steps required
for installing TVX on a CP/M 2.2 Z80-based machine.

     I have the sources but am somewhat overwhelmed by the amount of
code and all the switches involved.  At one point I recall reading
that C/80 (Software Toolwork's C compiler) was capable of compiling
this thing but I seemed to have difficulties.

     Thanks for your help..

EXKERMI1 is different from EXKERMIT in that it is a version of KERMIT
written in assy language (hence it is faster and smaller than the
EXKERMIT written in Turbo Pascal).  It also has software-selectable
serial port access whereas EXKERMIT does not (either the modem OR
serial printer port -- one is a DTE the other is set up as a DCE).  In
addition, if you are familiar with the <esc>-command sequence
completion of some of the DEC machines, this version of KERMIT has
that.  I took the assy lang version of the machine-independent version
of KERMIT from CU20B at Columbia and wrote a machine-dependent overlay
for the Osborne Executive computer.

EVOLUTION@KESTREL

   This direct-distribution mailing list is organized to discuss consequences
   of the theory of evolution, with emphasis on mathematics, on computer
   simulations, and on literature.  While creationists in this group are
   expected to be few in number, and while they may not reasonably expect to be
   taken seriously unless they can introduce radically better evidence than
   creationists have in the past, we have no agreement to limit discussion of
   contraversal topics.  The coordinator assumes no responsibility for opinions
   expressed in the group or for misuse.

   Archives are available only upon request to EVOLUTION-REQUEST@KESTREL.

   All requests to be added to or deleted from this list, problems, questions,
   etc., should be sent to EVOLUTION-REQUEST@KESTREL.

HUMAN-NETS@RED.RUTGERS.EDU

   Mailing list originally consisting of the combined memberships of
   INFO-PCNET, HOME-SAT, and TELETEXT mailing lists.  Human-Nets has discussed
   many topics, all of them related in some way to the theme of a world-wide
   computer and telecommunications network usually called WorldNet.  The topics
   have ranged very widely, from something like tutorials, to state of the art
   discussions, to rampant speculation about technology and its impact.  The
   list is extremely large, making it necessary to batch messages sent to the
   list and distributing them once each day during off peak periods to avoid
   overloading the system.

   The permanent archives contain all of the material distributed to the list.
   Due to size, this archive is broken down into several different files,
   stored in reverse temporal order.  The files are currently stored on ARPANet
   host RU-BLUE in files RHYTHM:<PLEASANT.HUMAN-NETS>HUMNET.* (where "*" is a
   wild-card).

   All requests to be added to or deleted from this list, problems, questions,

INFO-1100@SUMEX-AIM.STANFORD.EDU
BUG-1100@SUMEX-AIM.STANFORD.EDU

   These discussion lists focus on Xerox 1100 workstations (1100, 1108, 1132,
   1185, 1186) and protocols.  Their purpose is to stimulate communication and
   sharing between computer science research groups that are using or are
   interested in these machines.

   Info-1100 is the "information channel" where messages such as announcements
   of available lispusers packages may be made or for queries such as "Does
   anybody know of a PUP file server implementation for the Sinclair ZX-80?".
   It is intended to be a low-volume list suitable for the casual reader.
   Bug-1100 is the "bug channel" where readers can warn others of Interlisp-D
   bugs and/or suggest workarounds or solicit help or discussion; it is
   expected to have greater volume than Info-1100, being for the hard-core
   user.  Since hard-core users read both lists, Bug-1100 is a subset of
   Info-1100 and there is never a need to send to both lists.

   Xerox PARC, SIS, and AIS people are included in the distribution list to
   facilitate communication about new developments, bugs, performance issues,
   etc..  Additionally, Info-1100 and Bug-1100 are automatically forwarded to
   AISupport.pasa@Xerox, where bugs are noted and acted upon if appropriate.
   Xerox AIS employees will not respond in Bug-1100 unless the reply is of
   general interest or silence would mislead the readership.

   Archives of messages are kept on SUMEX-AIM in files:
      <BBOARD>INFO-1100.TXT      <BBOARD>BUG-1100.TXT
   Some net-contributed lispusers packages, updates, and patches are kept on
   SUMEX-AIM in files:
      <LISPUSERS.INTERMEZZO>      <LISPUSERS.KOTO>      etc.

   Requests to be added to or deleted from these lists, problems, questions,
   etc. should be sent to Info-1100-Request@SUMEX-AIM.STANFORD.EDU or
   Bug-1100-Request@SUMEX-AIM.STANFORD.EDU.

INFO-FUTURES%BU-CS@CSNet-Relay.ARPA
      INFO-FUTURES@BU-CS (CSNET)
      ...harvard!bu-cs!info-futures (UUCP)

   Digest to provide a speculative forum for analyzing current and likely
   events in technology as they will affect our near future in computing and
   related areas.  In broad terms, topics of interest include developments in
   both computing research and industry which are likely to affect our decision
   making, particularly decisions we are probably grappling with right this
   minute.  Technologies can change so rapidly that simply forecasting for
   needs within any organization one or two years in advance can be extremely
   difficult, frequently we are forced to provide foundations that effectively
   lock us into a technology for longer periods of time. It is hoped the

INFO-IBMPC@USC-ISIB

   Info-IBMPC is a forum for technical discussion of the IBM Personal Computer
   and compatible micro-computers, providing a way for interested members of
   the ARPANET community to compare notes, ask questions, and share insights of
   a technical nature about these machines.  While it is not primarily a
   consumer's guide to the IBM PC, the digest may also be useful for that
   purpose.

   Messages are collected, edited into digests and distributed as the volume of
   mail dictates (generally twice a week).  All messages of a technical nature
   about IBM PCs are welcomed; messages about other topics will not be run.  In
   addition, two topics are taboo and are routinely edited out: (1) self
   promotion of products for sale, and (2) anything about copy protection.

   Recent digests are archived on USC-ISIB in <INFO-IBMPC>DIGESTS-85. Older
   digests are archived by quarter in the following files:

      Q1-DIGESTS-85   ; V4 # 1-40 [too big for mm, use hermes]
      Q4-DIGESTS-84   ; V3 # 91-119
      Q3-DIGESTS-84   ; V3 # 70-90
      Q2-DIGESTS-84   ; V3 # 36-69

      Q1-DIGESTS-83   ; V2 # 1-19
      Q34-DIGESTS-82  ; V1 # 1-34

      These files can be read by MM, HERMES, and other TOPS20 mail systems.
      KWIC-INDEX.TXT contains a key-word-in-context index to digest articles.
      TOC.???85 contains a table of contents for the month ???. These files may
      be FTP'ed to any Arpanet/Milnet host from [USC-ISIB]<INFO-IBMPC> by
      logging in within FTP using username ANONYMOUS, password GUEST.  If
      you're not directly on the Arpanet the files can be mailed to you,
      although there is a limit to the length of a message.

   A library of free software is maintained in [USC-ISIB]<INFO-IBMPC>.  The
   list of available programs is in <INFO-IBMPC>PROGRAM-LIBRARY.LIST. Donations
   of source code are eagerly welcomed (even trivial programs). Donated
   programs must be truly free, with no fee or contribution required or
   requested.  To donate a program to the library, send a description of the
   program along with a copy of the source code to INFO-IBMPC-REQUEST.

INFO-KERMIT@CU20B

   Kermit is a file transfer protocol for use primarily between micros and
   mainframes over TTY lines, and is implemented on a wide variety of both. The
   Info-Kermit mailing list is a digest intended for people who maintain or
   install Kermit at their sites, or who are (thinking about) working on a new
   implementation, or who have bugs and/or fixes to report, or who are
   interested in discussing the protocol; it is available on Internet, CSnet,
   Mailnet, BITnet, Usenet, CCnet, and any other network gatewayed to the
   Internet.

   All the Kermit files are on CU20B in the area "KER:" or "K2:".  The file
   KER:AAAREAD.ME contains information on what files are in the Kermit
   distribution area and how to find them.  One file worth checking from time
   to time is KER:AAVNEW.HLP, a brief tabular listing of each existing version
   of Kermit, showing the version number and date of the latest release of each
   version.  The file KER:AANETW.HLP lists in detail the procedures for
   obtaining Kermit files via network.

   Kermit files, including program source and documentation, are available as
   follows:

      Internet: anonymous FTP from host CU20B, area KER: or K2:, 24 hours a
      day, 7 days a week.

      BITnet: from the KERMSRV server at host CUVMA; type SMSG RSCS MSG CUVMA
      KERMSRV HELP for further information.

      UUCP: from Oklahoma State University (host okstate) in Stillwater, OK.
      Mail to uucp-support%okstate@CSNET-RELAY for further information.
      Selected sources (usually Unix-related) are posted to net.sources from
      time to time.

      CCNET: DECnet NFT from host CU20B.  Anonymous NFT connections are not
      permitted from all hosts, so file transfers must be made by system
      managers or programmers who have access to CU20B.

      U.S. Mail: send requests for information to:

         Kermit Distribution
         Columbia University Center for Computing Activities
         612 West 115 Street
         New York, NY  10025

   Info-Kermit mail was direct up until May 23, 1984, when it became a digest.
   The pre-digest messages are in KER:MAIL.83A and KER:MAIL.84A.  Volume 1 of
   the digest is in KER:MAIL.84B.  The current, active digest is in
   KER:MAIL.TXT.  From time to time, active digests will be retired to files
   with names like KER:MAIL.85A, KER:MAIL.85B, and so on.

   All requests to be added to or deleted from this list, problems, questions,
   etc., should be sent to INFO-KERMIT-REQUEST@CU20B.  If your host does not
   support long names in mail addesses, then just send to KERMIT@CU20B.

   With FTP access as user "anonymous" and any password,you can bring these
   files over to your host and download them to your Macintosh. "Usenet" and
   some of the other networks that copy info-mac will see sources redistributed
   at the time they are mentioned in the digest distributions.  You can in
   addition, purchase a dump tape of the directory; see the file
   <INFO-MAC>00ORDER.

   <INFO-MAC> is also the repository for the development tools and utilities
   developed at SUMEX and at other universities. The "sumacc" cross compiler is
   also available on tape for a minimal charge: See the file
   <INFO-MAC>SUMACC.ORDER

   Messages to INFO-MAC@SUMEX-AIM are scanned to filter out any list requests,
   questions previously answered, pure speculation or opinion, or message
   obviously not in line with the stated purpose of the list.

   All requests to be added to or deleted from this list, problems, questions,

INFO-MICRO@BRL

   Information/discussion list on the general interest topic of microcomputers.

   Questions/discussions on a particular Operating System, such as CP/M, should
   be addressed to the specific list if one already exists (such as
   INFO-CPM@MC.LCS.MIT.EDU (or @BRL) for this example).

   Archives of recent correspondence are kept on SIMTEL20 in several files:

      "PS:<ARCHIVES.MICRO>MICRO.ARCHIV.ymmdd"  is a group of files containing
      correspondence going back several years.  The characters "ymmdd" in the
      file names are actually digits giving the year, month and day of the last
      message in each particular file.  "PS:<ARCHIVES.MICRO>MICRO-ARCHIV.TXT"
      contains a growing archive of current correspondence.

      Over 80 megabytes of public domain software (most of it CP/M) are kept in
      five program archives on SIMTEL20.  For a description of these archives,
      request a copy of the "archive blurb" from INFO-CPM-REQUEST@AMSAA.  All
      correspondence and program archives described here are available to
      Internet users via FTP with user-name ANONYMOUS.

INFO-MODEM7@SIMTEL20.ARPA

   Discussion group for the CP/M MODEM7 Christensen protocol file transfer
   program.  The group is concerned with development, upgrades and bug-fixes.
   It is probably of no interest to most users of the program because as new
   versions are released they are announced to INFO-CPM.

   The current INFO-MODEM7 archives, started with the move from MC to SIMTEL20,
   are kept in PS:<ARCHIVES.MODEM7>MODEM7-ARCHIV.TXT.
   If and when the older archives are located, that file will be placed in
   PS:<ARCHIVES.MODEM7>INFO-MODEM7.ARCHIV.ymmdd.
   These files are available via ANONYMOUS FTP from SIMTEL20 for those with
   TCP/IP access to the Internet.

INFO-MODULA-2@ROCHESTER.ARPA

   A discussion list for the Modula-2 programming language.  Modula-2 is a
   language by Niklaus Wirth which extends the Pascal foundation by providing
   an updated statement syntax (generalized LOOP, EXIT, RETURN, no GOTO),
   separate compilation with a module (compilation unit) broken into
   specification and implementation parts with importing and exporting of
   objects, controlled machine level access, and concurrent programming and
   coroutines.  Modula-2 has most of the power of Ada but is small enough that
   excellent full implementations exist for CP/M 80.

   Mail archives are stored on SIMTEL20 in file:
      <ARCHIVES.MODULA-2>MODULA-2-ARCHIV.TXT
   They are available via ANONYMOUS FTP from SIMTEL20 for those with TCP/IP
   access to the Internet.

INFO-PCNET@MC.LCS.MIT.EDU

   INFO-PCNET is a general mailing list to keep interested people advised of
   major developments.

   PCNET is a volunteer effort creating a computer network for personal use.
   Although meant to be device independent, the current design is oriented to
   use through the telephone system, particularly by computers with automatic
   dialing and receipt of calls.  PCNET will enable all computer users, whether
   part of a formal network organization or individual owners of personal
   computers, to communicate with each other effectively.  PCNET is defining
   communication protocols that assure that transmissions are correct
   (retransmitting data that is lost or erroneous), and which allow multiple
   logical data streams so that several programs can share a single hardware
   communication link.  PCNET has defined a worldwide addressing standard that
   permits automatic forwarding of messages and files without having to know
   the topology of the network.

   PCNET is currently finising software on several machines (8080, 6502,
   PDP-10) using several languages (Assembly language, LISP, C), and refining
   the documentation; volunteer communications programmers are needed to
   complete these tasks.

   The PCNET files are on SIMTEL20 in directory PD:<PCNET>.  SIMTEL20 supports
   ANONYMOUS login within FTP them using any non-null password.

   All requests to be added to or deleted from this list, problems, questions,

BUG-TMODEM@SIMTEL20.ARPA

   The INFO-TMODEM list is a means for the maintainer of the TMODEM program to
   send notices to users of TMODEM.  Users of TMODEM send bug reports and
   feature requests to BUG-TMODEM@SIMTEL20.

   TMODEM is a new TOPS-20 implementation of the Christensen Protocol, with all
   the latest features, such as:
      o  wildcard file transfers in the style of MODEM7
         (YMODEM batch is coming)
      o  the YMODEM implementation of the K option with a new algorithm
         to return to K mode after falling back to "normal" mode
      o  extensive built-in HELP for all commands and options.
   TMODEM is an amalgamation of the old TOPS-20 MODEM program, originally
   written by Bill Westfield while he was at SRI and now at Stanford, major
   pieces of the TOPS-20 TELNET program, currently maintained by Mark Crispin,
   and some pieces of code stolen from TTLINK and KERMIT-20 by Frank da Cruz at
   Columbia University.

   The archives for replaced mailing list INFO-MODEMXX are frozen in
   <ARCHIVES.MODEMXX> on SIMTEL20.  A new set of archives for INFO-TMODEM is on
   SIMTEL20 in <ARCHIVES.TMODEM>TMODEM-ARCHIV.TXT.  The source for TMODEM is in

   small (micro) computers may be moved from INFO-MICRO, INFO-CPM, etc., into
   INFO-UNIX.  Hopefully, enough people who know some answers will subscribe so
   that the list serves a purpose; some overlap is expected with the
   UNIX-WIZARDS list.

   All requests to be added to or deleted from this list, problems, questions,
   etc., should be sent to INFO-UNIX-REQUEST@BRL.ARPA.

   Moderator: Mike Muuss <mike@BRL.ARPA>

   and AIList or the Prolog list, except in special cases.

   Please "sign" subscriptions with full name and address so that people can
   access you from Internet and/or BITNET (many other networks can be reached
   through them and are certainly urged to participate).

   There is no objection to distributing material that is destined for
   conference proceedings or any other publication.  The Coordinator is
   involved in SIGIR Forum and, unless submittors request otherwise, may
   include submissions in whole or in part in future paper versions of the
   FORUM.  Indeed, this is one form of solicitation for FORUM contributions!
   Both IRList and the FORUM are unrefereed, and opinions are always those of
   the author and not of any organization unless there are other indications.
   Copies of list items should credit the original author, not necessarily the
   IRList.

   Archival copies of all digests will be kept; feel free to ask IRList-Request
   for recent back issues.  Note that FTP is not possible, so all communication
   must be by EMAIL, phone, or letter.

LIST OF MAILING LISTS

   Mailing-list for "List of lists" update notices.

   There is a master list of ARPANET mailing-lists/digests/discussion groups
   (~140 lists/2600+ lines/120,000+ characters) on SRI-NIC in files:
      NETINFO:INTEREST-GROUPS-1.TXT  (first half of the list)
      NETINFO:INTEREST-GROUPS-2.TXT  (second half of the list)
      For ARPANET users, SRI-NIC supports the net-standard ANONYMOUS
      login within FTP, with any password.

   To keep people up to date on the large number of such lists, there is a
   mailing-list for list-of-lists \update notices/.  Copies of the list itself
   are not sent to the world at large, but for those ARPANET users who
   seriously intend to FTP the updated versions when updated, a brief notice
   will be sent when a new version is available.  For those liaisons at
   internet sites who maintain or redistribute copies for their own networks
   (DECNet, Xerox, BitNet, MailNet, etc.) and can't reach the master by ARPANET
   FTP, the complete new file will be sent if necessary.  File copies will not
   normally be sent to individual users, either ARPANET or internet.

   To get on the list (or to submit updates to existing mailing-lists or add
   new ones), send requests to Rich Zellich <ZELLICH@SRI-NIC.ARPA>

Love-Hounds@MIT-Eddie

   This is a mailing list for the discussion of Kate Bush's music (and any

   feminism is generally viewed as a good thing on this list.  This mailing
   list is digested as a kindness to various mail systems.

   All requests to be added to or deleted from this list, problems, questions,
   etc., should be sent to MAIL-MEN-REQUEST@ROCHESTER.

   these protocols.  The conference/mailing list can discuss such things as how
   to understand and interpret the MHS recommendation, how to map existing mail
   system and mail network features onto the MHS structure etc.

   To minimize international communications costs, separate distribution lists
   for CSNET/ARPANET and CDNNET users are being maintained at UWISC and UBC
   respectively.  ARPANET and CSNET users should send messages to
   MHS_IMPLEMENTATION@WISC-RSCH.  CDNNET users should send messages to
   MHS_IMPLEMENTATION@EAN.UBC.CDN.  Messages sent to one of the lists will be
   forwarded to members of the other lists.

   Everyone on the list is expected to contribute from time to time.

   Nearly everyone in NAMEDROPPERS is also on HEADER-PEOPLE and also on
   MSGGROUP.  There is no need to send a message to both NAMEDROPPERS and
   either of these lists (and certianly not both!).

   All of the previous NAMEDROPPERS discussion can be found in SRI-NIC files
      <NAMSER>NAMEDROPPERS.198X
   where X is the number of the year of the archive you are looking for.  A/O

NL-KR@ROCHESTER.ARPA

   NL-KR is open to discussion of any topic related to the natural language
   (both understanding and generation) and knowledge representation, both as
   subfields of AI.  The Moderator's interests are primarily in:

      Knowledge Representation    Natural Language Understanding
      Discourse Understanding     Philosophy of Language
      Plan Recognition            Computational Linguistics

   Contributions are also welcome on topics such as:

      Cognitive Psychology (as related to NL/KR)
      Human Perception (same)
      Linguistics
      Machine Translation
      Computer and Information Science (as may be used to implement various
      Logic Programming (same)                                   NL systems)

   Contributions may be anything from tutorials to speculation. In particular,
   the following are sought:

      Abstracts                             Reviews
      Lab Descriptions                      Research Overviews
      Work Planned or in Progress           Half-Baked Ideas
      Conference Announcements              Conference Reports
      Bibliographies                        History of NL/KR
      Puzzles and Unsolved Problems         Anecdotes, Jokes, and Poems
      Queries and Requests                  Address Changes (Bindings)

   This list is in some sense a spin-off of the AIList, and as such, a certain
   amount of overlap is expected. The primary concentration of this list should
   be NL and KR, that is, natural language (be it understanding, generation,
   recognition, parsing, semantics, pragmatics, etc.) and how we should
   represent knowledge (aquisition, access, completeness, etc. are all valid
   issues).  Topics deemed to be outside the general scope of this list will be
   forwarded to AIList (or other more appropriate list) or rejected.

   Archival copies of all digests will be kept; feel free to ask NL-KR-REQUEST
   for recent back issues.

   All requests to be added to or deleted from this list, problems, questions,
   etc., should be sent to NL-KR-REQUEST@ROCHESTER.ARPA.

POLI-SCI@RUTGERS

   POLI-SCI is a spinoff from the HUMAN-NETS discussion list.  Shortly after
   the November 1980 election, HUMAN-NETS began to discuss the impact that
   electronic communications had on the election.  As this discussion
   continued, it lost its narrow focus on electronic communications and began
   to consider the election in general, how elections are won and lost, and the
   nature of the electoral college.  The growth of these discussions, and their
   spawning of related discussions, indicated that a separate discussion list
   was merited and POLI-SCI was installed.  Since then POLI-SCI has begun to
   consider other topics including the history of the Carter and Nixon
   presidencies, the Iranian hostage crisis, etc. (with a little less dignity,
   the list might be characterized as a permanent distributed political bull
   session).

   Archived digest messages are stored on RUTGERS in:

PROLOG[-HACKERS]@SU-SCORE

   Prolog and logic programming mailing lists.

   Some of the people answering the initial BBoard message stated that they
   would be interested in general Prolog and logic programming information, but
   not in the nitty-gritty details of Prolog systems and their bugs. Therefore,
   two mailing lists have been set up, PROLOG and PROLOG-HACKERS: PROLOG will
   provide a digest of articles of general interest; PROLOG-HACKERS will
   provide a direct mailing for the nasty stuff.  Finally, PROLOG-REQUEST
   should be used for distribution requests.  In a nutshell:

      Mail to                 for
      -------                 ---

      PROLOG@SCORE            sending articles of general interest
      PROLOG-HACKERS@SCORE    sending articles of limited interest
      PROLOG-REQUEST@SCORE    getting in and out of the mailing lists
                               and other bureaucracy

   Please do not send the same message to PROLOG and PROLOG-HACKERS.  Messages
   will be moved between lists if appropriate.

   An archive of the USEnet prolog interest group interchange can be FTP'd from
   host SU-SCORE using standard anonymous login convention.  The pathname is:

Psychnet <EPSYNET%UHUPVM1.BITNET@WISCVM.WISC.EDU>

   PSYCHNET (tm) is a psychology Newsletter and mailing list, sending out
   information, news, and academic papers to those who sign up.  An initial
   formal purpose of Psychnet is distribution of academic papers in advance of
   the 1986 APA convention; other purposes will develop according to the needs
   and interests of the profession and Psychnet users.

   Outside BitNet, Psychnet is a Newsletter and mailing list only.  Once per
   week, members receive the latest Psychnet Newsletter and Index of files
   available on the server machine.  If a file looks interesting send an E-mail
   request to EPSYNET%UHUPVM1.BITNET@WISCVM.WISC.EDU and the file will be sent
   to you.

   Within BitNet, Psychnet is also a 24-hour server machine which mails out
   files to users who first send the PSYCHNET HELP command to userid UH-INFO at
   node UHUPVM1 (*NOT* to userid EPSYNET).  Persons within BitNet may also sign
   up for the mailing list and will get the Newsletter and Index along with
   other news.  BitNet users, however, should get their files directly from the
   server machine; an Exec file is available for CMS users and COM files are
   available for VAX users within BitNet.

   To have a file or idea distributed to members of the list send it to the
   primary list address and it will be sent out, usually with the week's
   Psychnet Newsletter.

   All requests to be added to or deleted from the mailing list, or to have
   files distributed should be sent to EPSYNET%UHUPVM1.BITNET@WISCVM.WISC.EDU.

   about Scribe features, bugs, enhancements, performance, support, and other
   topics of interest to Scribe DBAs.  The list will NOT be moderated, but will
   simply consist of a mail "reflector" - ie. if you send a message to the

SECURITY@RUTGERS

   This list is designed to provide a forum for discussion of the field of
   security in general, be it electronic, physical, or computer-related.  Since
   the original idea was to name this list LOCKSMITHS, discussions about
   physical security and hardware are welcomed, but to broaden out into
   computer security and electronic access control and such is also valid.  In
   other words, any subject matter relating to the *improvement* and
   *implementation* of security systems is okay, while how to *defeat* them is
   not.  Messages are not digestified, but are filtered to keep things of
   questionable legality/ content from escaping out to the network.

SF-CONS LIST

   Mailing-List for SF Conventions listing update notices.

   There is a master SF cons list (averaging 1000-1500 lines or 55,000-75,000
   characters, including geographic cross-reference) on SRI-NIC in file:
      <ZELLICH>CONS.TXT
   For ARPANET users, SRI-NIC supports the net-standard ANONYMOUS login within
   FTP, with any password.

   In order to proliferate the list more quickly, there is a mailing list for
   cons-list \update notices/.  Copies of the cons list itself are not sent to
   the world at large, but for those ARPANET users who seriously intend to FTP
   the updated versions every few weeks, a brief notice will be sent when a new
   version is available.  For those liaisons at internet sites who maintain or
   redistribute copies for their own networks (DECNet, Xerox, BitNet, MailNet,
   etc.), the complete new file will be sent out if necessary.  File copies
   will \not/ be sent to individual users, either ARPANET or internet.

   Update notices/file copies can be expected approximately every 2nd or 3rd
   month.  Sources of cons for the list are LOCUS, ANALOG, STARLOG, flyers
   picked up at cons by local fen, and anything sent to the list maintainer.

   To get on the update-notices list (or to submit con updates), send messages
   to Rich Zellich <ZELLICH@SRI-NIC.ARPA>.

SF-LOVERS@RED.RUTGERS.EDU

   Science Fiction lovers.  SF-LOVERS has discussed many topics, all of them
   related in some way to the theme of science fiction or fantasy.  The topics
   have ranged very widely from rewritten stories, bad SF movies, and SF
   conventions to reviews of books and films.  The range of topics is quite
   wide and anyone is welcome to submit material on these or other topics of
   interest in this general area.

   The digest has a very large number of readers, and trivial messages are
   strongly discouraged due to the heavy load SF-LOVERS puts on the hosts CPU
   and disk space.  Messages to SF-LOVERS@RUTGERS are batched and broadcast
   periodically.

   The SF-LOVERS archives are available on RUTGERS.  Each volume is contained
   in its own file, with the contents ordered chronologically. The first
   archive includes a number of messages from the early days before digests and
   there is much of "historical" interest.  At the end of that volume is a long
   discussion which took place during the Star Wars series craze.

      T:<SFL>ARCHIVE.V1      860  2200759

      For those unfamiliar with Tenex/Tops-20, the first number is the number
      of Tenex disk pages, the second is the number of characters in the file,
      for checksumming purposes if you FTP the file.  Volume 11 is the current
      volume A/O Jan 86.  Old issues can also be found at RUTGERS and are in
      the files SF-LOVERS.xxx-yy where xxx is the month of publication and yy
      is the current year.  The current month's messages may be found in

SMAuG^.X@Xerox.ARPA

   Mailing list for communication of ideas about SMAuG (Simultaneous Multiple
   AdventUrer Game).  SMAuG is an applied research project designed to probe
   the problems of distributing the work of a complex piece of software across
   local intelligent devices and a remote timesharing computer.  The software
   being creating is an adventure game allowing multiple players.  Players may
   be controlled by either human users or planning software.  The project is
   potentially enormous and much paring of capabilities is expected.  The
   primary goals of the project are:

      Error free communication protocol
      Simple control of local intelligent devices
      Centralized database with local caching of unchanging data objects
      Local processing of user commands (to offload central system)
      An adventure game

   This project is an offshoot of a locally funded research grant examining the
   interaction of local intelligent devices and remote timesharing systems.
   Since January 1, 1984 we have been sponsored by the Rutgers Center for
   Computer and Information Services.  We hope to produce software useful to
   other members of the University computing community with this project.  Two
   such pieces of software are a remote file access system, and a universal
   window oriented terminal handler.

   The SMAuG group meets every Wednesday evening from 8pm until 10pm at Rutgers
   University in Hill Center room 318.  Hill Center is located on Busch Campus
   in Piscataway, New Jersey.  Requests for detailed directions should be sent
   to Fischer.PA@XEROX.ARPA.  If you are coming any distance to attend a
   meeting please contact Fischer.PA@XEROX.ARPA, sometimes the meetings are
   held elsewhere, and announcements of this are only distributed locally in
   the Rutgers area. Your attendance is, however, very welcome!

   There is a separate mailing-list for SMAuG Storywriters:
   SMAuG-Story^.X@Xerox.ARPA; archives for this list are available from
   Fischer.PA@Xerox.ARPA.

   All requests to be added to or deleted from this list, back issue requests,
   problems, questions, etc., should be sent to McGrew.Smaug@RU-BLUE.

UNIX-SW@SIMTEL20.ARPA

   UNIX-SW is a vehicle for announcing the availablity of new major packages of
   UNIX/'C' language software on the SIMTEL20 repository.  This list will also
   be used to mail periodic updates of the list of all UNIX software held at
   SIMTEL20 (probably monthly).

   UNIX-SW is not a forum for discussion of this software.  Such discussions
   are more appropriately held with the authors, or in other groups.  Rather,
   we are attempting to make known to the widest possible audience the contents
   of this large repository of public-domain software.

   SIMTEL20 is a DEC-20 machine running the TOPS20 operating system, located at
   White Sands Missile Range, New Mexico.  The machine is a host on the Defense
   Data Network (DDN), and as such, gives users located on other hosts the
   capability of directly transferring this software via the FTP (file transfer
   process) command.

   Mail archives are stored on SIMTEL20 in file:
      PS:<ARCHIVES.UNIX-SW>UNIX-SW-ARCHIV.TXT

Why can't you use a modem? If you can, there are programs that operate from the
C-128 mode to download CP/M files. (This is to accomadate the fact that the
first version of the 128's CP/M simply doesn't support a modem!) After you get
the December '85 version of CP/M 3.0, you can use IMP and MEX.

The PD terminal program is called CPMTERM7 and uses a MODEM7 type protocol. It
operates in 128 mode and puts files *in CP/M format* on CP/M disks. There may
be others, but I can't be sure.

Near the end of summer, I took our Kaypro in for drive alignment.  Its
been about a month-and-a-half and we've had no trouble...until now.
All of the programs seem to be OK (read: no panicky phone calls from
home) except for NULU (LU, LDIR, etc.)  It does not seem to be able to
read old library files (that is, created during the pre-align period).
BAD DIRECTORY or INSUFFICIENT MEMORY are the error messages.

I'd bet my left...arm that it is related to the recent alignment.
Short of un-aligning one drive and copying the file (or other such
kludges), does anyone have any suggestions?  The details are kind of
sketchy, and consulting over the phone with distraught relatives can
be hectic, so any help would be appreciated.

Good grief, why not just download the encoded file directly to your CP/M
machine (or copy it to a CP/M diskette, or whatever you intended to do with
the UUDECODED and UNARCed file) and UUDECODE it and UNARC it there?  The whole
purpose of ARC is to make files smaller and therefore faster to download (or
mail across the net), so why defeat it?
