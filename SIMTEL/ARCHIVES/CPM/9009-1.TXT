Check out some old Zsystem code.  Or look to TCJ magazine for some articles.
Some of Jay Sage's stuff is on SIMTEL.  Good luck on finding 8085 CP/M code.
You may need to stick to 8080 stuff.

There is an old book named "CP/M programmers' reference" by QUE.  It is the
most extensive ref. on the Official CP/M's & related stuff. (Not by DRI that
is!)

I just recently unloaded a II here in Tulsa.  Fortunately for me, my
video died earlier, and my local Kaypro dealer replaced the video board
and the tube.

My understanding of the kaypro II video is that there are several types
of tubes in II's, each requiring a matching video board.  Therefore, the
first thing I would do would be to try to find an exact replacement tube
from an electronics parts place, assuming that a voltmeter says that your
filament voltage and high voltage are still intact.

If this fails, there is an outfit which advertised in the Kaypro mags
called ERAC which carried spare parts, especially video.  Sorry, I don't
have any further information about them, except to say that you might try 
calling Microsphere in Oregon to get additional hardware type help or
phone numbers.

The keyboard is served by one of the two SIO chips you see on the motherboard
of the machine.  For the II-83, it's the chip at U70.  For the 2/84, it's the
chip at U11.  Replace it, and see if your problem goes away.  Mine did.

Hi:  In the 84 model I have there are 2 SIO's.  The keyboard uses half of one.
I'm not relly sure of the old units, but I have a schematic & I'll get back to
you on it.  As I recall, the 83 units only have one serial on the back panel
and no internal modem. So, I'd assume that one half of the SIO is for the port
and the other half is the keyboard.  That might get you going.  Catch up with
you soon. . .   Ronn

Sorry 'bout that.  It does have alot of stuff on utilities & languages too.

Note that measuring the high voltage on a tube requires a special
HV meter. You're trying to test something in the area of 8-9KV here,
at very low current levels. Do NOT try to measure it with your average
VOM; it's not designed for it. FYI, a color tubes' HV is generally
20KV or higher. Don't poke around with it unless you have the proper
tools and someone standing by to shut off power in emergencies.

Well, I've decided it's time to clean out my toy box before
I start any new projects, and one of the toys that I think
I'm going to dispose of is my SB180 system. 

Here's my setup:

	* XBIOS
	* SCSI board
	* Hard disk controller w/10 Meg Miniscribe
	* 2 360K floppies
	* 1 760K floppy (flaky, but I can include a replacement)
	* Integrand case w/power supply

Interested?  I don't even know how much I'd ask for the thing. If I get
an offer that seems reasonable (probably depending on my mood :-) I'll
let it go.  Else I'll probaly just gut it and turn the board into some 
sort of controller.

Hello All --

I stumbled onto some S-100 cards last weekend that I'm very curious about,
and wonder if any cp/mer's might know about them.  First, an "Advanced
Digital" super six.  It looks like a complete CPU on a card.  128k DRAM,
floppy controller, two (?) serial ports, and a parallel port.  Of course there
is no documentation.  Anybody know about these things??  Are they worth
trying to get running (forgot to mention that it's a 6 MHz Z-80).  Are
there any sources of dox??  Also snagged an old 64K static ram card
(George Morrow) with 32 2K SRAM chips (very useful), but right in the
middle of these guys is a "82S100".  What is that ... a memory manager
of some sort??, PAL??  Anybody know??

Subject: SYSGEN on the TRS-80 Model 4
Message-ID: <3AC186439C9F8017D3@uwplatt.edu>

Hello All,
 
I am trying to install Z80CCP and ZCPR1 on my TRS-80 Model 4
running Montezuma Micro CP/M and I am having problems with the
SYSGEN program. Using sysgen, I place a copy of the current 64K
system into memory. I then save this image as cpm64.com. Using
DDT I load this image into memory, and overlay the Z80CCP code.
I veryify that the Z80CCP correctly overlayed the cp/m ccp. When
I try to instatll the modified system with SYSGEN, the system
locks up.  SYSGEN will read the original cpm64.com and place it
on disk.  I can make small changes to the cpm64.com with ddt,
and sysgen will still accept it for loading onto system tracks,
so I don't think that I am getting caught by SYSGEN making a
CRC or checksum. I am basically following the instructions in
the ZCPR1 installation file.
 
I am running out of ideas for getting the new CCP onto a system
disk. I have found where the ccp is kept on the system disk,
and I can even get it off into memory with one of the zap
programs. Would like to avoid having to type all the Z80CCP
hex data into a zap program by hand to get it onto disk, when
SYSGEN should do this form me.
 
Does anyone have any suggestions?

I'm afraid that the only way to exchange data with a DOS machine is 
through the serial port. You need to by an expansion from Amstrad wich

    well, I have trouble with the MOVCPM  under MM CP/M also, as does a
  friend of mine in minnesota so it be a bug in the program itself...

  I have an auto install program for Zcpr3 with the only difference
being that you boot up under MM CP/M first before you actually boot up
Zcpr3, but I guess you can make it auto-boot with the config program....
  So far it runs under MM CP/M on my 80 track drive...and haven't really
gotten around to installing it on my system disk (40 track single sided).
  The guy I got it from is supposed to be sending me some more utilities
 for it, since it only came with the basics to install it...

Subject: Sysgen and installing Z80CCP
Message-ID: <392E37688B1F801A10@uwplatt.edu>

Hello All,
 
Since I made my plea for help about SYSGEN on the TRS-80 Model 4, I
have discovered a few more things as I attempt to install Z80CCP.
 
I verified that DDT is loading the Z80CCP overlay correctly over the
old CCP which I placed in memory with SYSGEN. I am using the correct
offset.
 
SYSGEN seems to be checking a few bytes in the image, and will lock
the system up if those bytes do not agree with the cp/m ccp. I found
these by using ddt to fill areas of the cp/m ccp with 00H untill
SYSTEN would lock up (requiring reset) when looking at the memory
image of cp/m. I used divide-and-conquer until I located 5 bytes in
the ccp that cannot be changed to 0: (in the sysgen image) 0d28:10,
0d29:16, 0d2a:04, 0d2c:bf 0d2d:08. Other times sysgen will say I
a bad image and abort when I try to use the modified image.
 
Using DU-V85 (a disk utility available on simtel20) I found the
sectors on my system disk where the ccp is located. I have also worked
out the correct offset for DDT so that I can overlay the Z80CCP
correctly over the old version as Yanked off my system disk with DU
(no offset for SYSGEN).  What I need is a routine that will take
sectors from a file and write them to disk. DU will talk sectors
Yanked into memory and put them into a file, but not the reverse.
Does anyone have any suggestions?
 
Thanks again for your reply.  It is nice to know that at least someone
read my posting.

QTerm is it. You have to do some customizing, but, if you have an external
modem, you can make it a generic cp/m program.

I've lost your message about Amstrads, but the basic position is that they
are extremely common in the UK and almost unknown in the US.
 
You can hang 5.25" drives off them without much trouble, and also (I think)
do the other things you wanted.  Oh yes, I think there *is* an IBM version
of Locoscript, for the PC-compatible Amstrads.

Subject: MicroSoft Fortran-80 for Apple CP/M ???
Message-ID: <900912130754.20a1882e@RIGEL.TAMU.EDU>

I recent picked up a copy of Fortran-80 at a compu-bargain store.
  
It was supplied in the Apple 5.25" CP/M format.  However, when I tried to
run it, it appeared to operate OK, but it would not even compile the demo
programs that came with it and produced zero-length '.REL' files.
  
I followed the examples in the manual very carefully and the same thing
occurred each time.
  
Could this version be MS-SoftCard specific??  I use the PCPI AppliCard with
2 Disk ]['s and 2 UniDisk 3.5's using UNI35.DVR.
  
I had problems with MBASIC when I installed the UniDisk 3.5's. I found out that
the version I had was SoftCard specific (I was later able to obtain a generic
version which works just fine).
  
Are some versions of MS-Fortran-80 SoftCard Specific even in terms of program
operation (ignore special runtime routines)???
  
Better yet, can someone direct me to a good PD/SW CP/M FORTRAN system
(FORTRAN 77, extensions isf possible)??
  
Hangin' in there w/ CP/M  (looking for ZCPRx.y where x=MAX(version),
  						     y=MAX(release).

Message-ID: <900910121031.951985@DMZRZU71-UNI-MAINZ--GERMANY>

There are difficulties in using SYSGEN with a non-DRI CCP on the Model 4.
It seems that SYSGEN looks for a checksum and will not accept Z80CCP or
ZCPRx. The solution is to write a program that will overlay the original
system with the new CCP or to extend Z80CCP with an in-memory-loader
which will move Z80CCP to it's location.
Problems with the new 48K-BIOS might result from the fact, that the newly
generated BIOS contains the same drive parameters as the original version,
2 physical drives SSSD 40 Trk. If you have installed other drives, the
original BIOS wouldn't recognize them. You must then insert a MM SYS DISK
containing CONFIG.COM into A: and configure the new System to a freshly
formatted disk, I missed the details.

For information about about a better (banked) BIOS and ZCPR33, support for
80-Micro 320 K RAM etc., mail me your hardware configs.

Hello All,
 
In my efforts to get z80ccp installed on my system, I downloaded the

work like du-v85 that I had been using.
 
Du-v89.com would not read sectors with the + and - commands, but would
stay on the sector selected when right after the Track command was
given.  I have du-v85, and it properly reads sectors after every + and
- command.
 
Has anyone else noticed this problem? I am running a cp/m system with

I finally did get Z80CCP running on my Model 4.  It works with all the
software I have tested it with, except SYS2M, a utility for putting the
cp/m system into the ram drive to speed up warm boot operations. Many
thanks to those who offered suggestions to my query for help:

I found out that SYSGEN for my system would not be helpful for installing
Z80CCP, but that I could move the z80ccp.com file sector by sector to
overlay the system tracks. Which is what I did, using DU-V85.COM, after
I found out where the ccp was stored on the system tracks.
 
My next project is to increment my cp/m experience by installing zcpr1
to see how it compares, and then z80dos. This may seem foolish, but the
idea is to get more knowledge about how cp/m is put together, as a program,
and on the disk.

There are two versions of Small-C that I KNOW of.  Vers 2.1 I have and was
distributed by MT Books of Redwood City, CA a while back (Dr.Dobbs Fame)
I don't think it's really PD, but it's as close as you're likely to get.
I've got a Kaypro too & was looking for a better compiler (still am)

I'm basically giving in & buying a commercial one soon, but can't decide which.
I have a lot of code for C/80 & BD Software has a new Z-system compatible
compiler for cheep (90 or 60$ depending, see TCJ # 42 Z-corner for more info)
and Hi Tech C has been rumoured to be going for cheep lately in the US and is
supposedly ANSI compatible; Hence my indecision.

You can ask Jay Sage about BDS Z, since I think he can distribute it thru Sage
microsystems East.  He is on the net, but commercial things don't belong here I
think.  So you may want to contact him direct.  I might buy both BDS Z & Hi
tech if I can get a deal on Hi tech.  Let me know what you find out.

Also, I can send you the Small-c archive if you like; just send me yer address
& I'll see about the ok'ness of it ( I believe it's like shareware -25$ ???)

My personal favorite is "The Programmer's CP/M Handbook", by
Andy Johnson-Laird.  Not only is he very knowledgeable about
CP/M, but my understanding is that DR licensed their source code
to him for development.  He's a licensed DR developer.

The book has these chapters:

    1. Introduction
    2. The Structure of CP/M
    3. The CP/M File System
    4. The Console Command Processor (CCP)
    5. The BASIC Disk Operating System
    6. The BASIC Input/Output System
    7. Building a New CP/M System
    8. Writing an Enhanced BIOS
    9. Dealing with Hardware Errors
   10. Debugging a New CP/M System
   11. Additional Utility Programs
   12. Error Messages

Another good book, which doesn't get as deep into CP/M as Andy's book,
is "Mastering CP/M", by Alan R. Miller (published by Sybex) (by the way,
Andy's book is published by Osborne-McGrawHill.).  Alan's book puts more
emphasis on writing for CP/M, using macro assemblers like M80.

Here are the chapters:

    1. CP/M Organization and Operation
    2. Duplicating and Altering CP/M Disks
    3. Adding Features to BIOS
    4. Building a Macro Library
    5. Using BDOS for Nondisk Operations
    6. Reading Disk Files With BDOS
    7. Writing Disk Files With BDOS
    8. The CP/M Directory

the following setup, I'd appreciate it if someone could forward me the
proper gen and par files.
 
Turbo-Dos 1.4
HDC-1001 Hard Disk Controller with Tandon 702 drive (i've got the tables for the hard disk)
Super Six S-100 Single
(5) Super Slave cards.
I have no line printers or other attached S-100 systems

I'd like each slave processor to run the same configuration of turbo-dos,
and the console too.
 The console is 9600 baud, and the other slaves at 9600 aswell.
 
can anyone send me the proper Gen and Par files?
If necessary, I'll download the directories of all my origional disks and
send them to you.

It is _copy protection_!  Sysgen and CCP contain the serial number of
the o/s, and sysgen checks if they match before doing a copy.  I think
it was to cater for OEM specials that were not supplied with a sysgen,
and you could only get new copies from the supplier, rather than create
your own.

*BEEEEP*  "Wrong guess. Do you want to go for double jeopardy where the stakes

Seriously, it _IS_ possible to exchange files with an IBM without having
to resort to the serial cable/RS232C mess and it doesn't even require a 
typist and an IBM !!!

A couple of years ago, my father bought an add on 5.25" drive from a company
called Peartree computers in England. I don't know if they still exist.
However, this beast enabled you to read/write 80 track 720kB CP/M 3.3 disks
and 40 track (320kB ??) IBM disks, the latter using special conversion
software that came with the machine.

So start checking London's Yellow Pages and good luck !!

	Hi! I'm interested in acquiring Z80 CP/M goodies. A long time ago
when I had an Apple IIe I had a Z80 soft-card. Spent a fraction of my time
doing 6502 Assembly language (yuch) - the rest doing Z80 Assembly language
programming (yeah). After that I went to a CCP/M 86 S100 system that I still
have. It uses the 80186. Don't really use it nor have a desire to learn 8086 
assembly language. Have been and am an advocate of the Amiga computer since
1985. 
	I want to regain the ability to be able to incorporate the Z80 in
future projects.  The Z80 is dirt cheap and a fantastic processor to write
code for. 

	Please, anyone who is looking to dump Z80 SBC's (and naturally CP/M)
and/or software M80, L80, etc. please get back to me.

Good score.  I don't know anything about those tho, sorry.  But I used to work
at the lab there, and there was a company down Vasco Road south of East Ave.
The guy who was VP (or?) left the Instrument shop at the lab to do S100 there
and then returned to the shop (?) before I left myself.  You might want to go
into the instrument shop & ask for him.  Unfortunately, I can't remember his
name.  You can give Gary Michalak a call & he might point you in the right
direction, regardless.  He's a pretty cluey bloke.  You can find him in the
directory. . .  Tell him hello from Big Ronn.

It's an old Signetics PROM, call Eric Davis in the CAMAC Test Facility for more

Sure, ZCPR is a replacement CCP (Console Command Processor) for CP/M systems.
It's difficult to grasp if you're not familiar with CP/M and how it's
structured, so I'd suggest that you find a quick descriptive article on it
(CP/M that is) to see how the rest will sit with you.  CP/M has access to
basically a 64Kbyte address space using a Z80 (That's where the Z comes from
in ZCPR) and parts of the operating system (CP/M) use various parts of it.
There is the BIOS, BDOS, CCP and TPA. . .
BIOS is the routines that allow interface to the particular hardware you've
got.  They come with the machine (hopefully) and are written by the computer's
manufacturer, originally.  You may replace this with specialty code if you can
find something for your machine still available.
BDOS are simple routines used for manditory functions.  They are all standard
by number & use so any CP/M program can call them to get something common
accomplished.  You can replace it with some thing like ZRDOS or ZSDOS I
believe.
CCP is what interfaces the User (you) to the BDOS & other things.  So ZCPRx
really is the front end of choice for many users since it's newer, faster,
nicer and generally more capable of keeping you sane while operating the micro
at hand.  It's can have many things in it depending upon which version you
have.  It's up to 3.4 now & you can buy an auto-install version (NZCOM) from
many places (ALPHA, etc.) for about $69.00 US.  Some of the features you may
find valuable are: Named directories, Standard Video Terminal Capabilities,
Aliasing and Shells (allows history of command line inputs & lots of other
labour saving features), multiple command lines & so much other stuph that it'l
spin you out.  It's definitely worth 69 bucks.  I understand NZCOM is so simple
to use that there is no excuse to run ZCPR over the stock CP/M CCP (except for
poverty or apathy)  you can also have the older versions (3.3) for free if you
can slog thru alot of system programming (tedious).  
Any ways,  That's probably more than you wanted to know except that the TPA is
the Transient Program Area, Basically it's what is left over that you run
applications in. (Wordstar, etc)  
Good luck,  go & get some issues of The Computer Journal or Microcornucopia if
you want to go further.

Regarding the recent missives about Amstrad PCW's etc: I am a PCW owner
inthe UK, and can confirm there are several external 3.5" and 5.25" disc
drives marketed for it by various companies over here... there is also
a 3" external drive (i.e. one which takes those nasty little Amstrad-
specific diskettes) intended to be hooked up to a PC.  I believe several
of the packages come with software intended to transfer files from the
Amstrad's CP/M to MS-DOS format too.

There is also *definitely* a MS-DOS version of the Locoscript WP software,
only recently released by Locomotive Software - called surprisingly,
Locoscript-PC.  Costs about 100 pounds.
Locomotive do produce a BASIC (called Mallard Basic, which is bundled with
the PCW along with CP/M+ and Locoscript), and lots of other stuff like
LocoSpell, LocoMail (self explanatory) LocoFile (pop-up database), LocoFont
(different fonts for the PCW's bundled printer, plus several more I don't
remember off-hand, all of which are ancillary to LocoScript.  

If anyone wants any more specific info, contact me by Email and I'll
delve into my back-issues of Amstrad magazines!

I can probably help out with a system disk for your friend's Morrow.  However,
the Morrow used many variants of CP/M which were dependent upon the model
and the monitor prom version.  That's the 24 pin chip in about the middle of
the board which probably has a sticker on it that says MD-ROM Rev n.n and 
what looks like a Hex checksum on it.  

With that information, I can perhaps help out.

works better than vt100 but not the best.  Any ideas?  What about a

Subject: 80 Track  drives as B-drive on AMSTRAD CP/M computers
Message-ID: <1497@doitcr.doit.sub.org>

Hello people,

I keep reading all sorts of very costfull advices on additional drives on 
AMSTRAD CP/M computers. We, the Schneider/Amstrad CPC User Group (SCUG) of 
Munich, offer help to everyone, who wants to add a second drive to his AMSTRAD.
 
Our advice is to always try and get a DSQD (i.e. 80 Track) drive, even if you 
can use only one side for the time beeing. We have a universal driver program
to support a single-sided 80 track format with 360K capacitiy for all AMSTRAD
CP/M computers that can also be use by the CPCs in BASIC! By using a hardware 
switcfor head select, one might also use the other side of the disk, by 
simply switching to the second head. Be careful not to modify the drive itself,
use jumper points, wherever possible. There are also some drives enabling 
double-stepping via jumper select, so that exchanging information with 40 track
drives is also possible, as long as you are the receiving side. If you initiate
such a disk, make sure to use a virgin disk, or, even better, a disk formatted
by the destination drive. 

The format is called B360K and available as public domain. A BASIC formatter,
a CP/M 2.2 formatter and a multipurpose CP/M Plus formatter are included in 
the package. Although copyrights are held by the author, Andreas Kisslinger,
you are free to copy and distribute these programs, provided no commercial 
pricing is charged. If you must charge copyiing, then please be moderate. 
 
Information anprograms can be obtained through me. Send a preformatted disk
of your format, labelled wtih your format name and your address plus a short
handwritten note what it is that you want to this address:
 
Schneider/Amstrad CPC User Group Munich, c/o Helmut Jungkunz, Zacherlstr. 14,
8045 Ismaning, Germany  Tel. 089/969374
 
Use any brand of dri, it'll work on almost all known drives. There are some
drives, though, that can only access 77 tracks correctly, those were used in 
older computers. Modern drives should all be capable of accessing at least 80 
to 82 tracks. 

Note: avoid strange formats, try to stick to the original formats
as soon as you want anybody else to ever read your disks. 

With best regards,

Helmut

Hello people,

I am the head of the Munich  Schneider/Amstrad CPC User Group (SCUG) and 
I am also SIG-OP of NBBS 08165/60041   300 1200 2400 Baud which represents
the direct contact to ZNODE #51, the only European ZNODE. 
You have to be a registered user with NBBS to access this system, though.
Membership is paid on time-dependant credits. So- you decide, when your 
money is going down the line, not a stupid bank computer.
 
Fees are  v e r y   moderate, believe me. 
 
Besides, we are looking for AMSTRAD users all over, to improve the performance
of our equipment. Many utilities can be programmed in a portable manner, so 
they can both run on PCWs and CPCs without any changes. This is a very important
point, which is often overlooked and creates lots of unnecessary work. 
 
Very good standard routines can be found in SYSLIB versions, latest of which is
version 4. All Help-files and 30 MB of utilities for ZCPR can be accessed here.
Note: Z3PLUS is testes and works fine on the AMSTRAD PCW as well! So now you
can make use of all the fine goodies for CP/M Plus as well!
 
3" discs are no pronlem to get over here. They're not too expensive (about 3 to
4 US \$s each, depending on exchange rates, I suppose).
 
User Groups, please do get in contact with us! We use all kinds of CP/M Machines
Atari Sts and IBM compatibles. We don't want any contacts with illegal copiers
of software, we want good and friendly contacts to all colleagues. 
 
Hope to hear from you soon!

The one possible cause is the value in HL when you return from the timer
patch. The code that calls the timer code expects HL to be zero on
return. If it's non-zero, then the programs assume an error, and don't
use the patch value, and prompt anyway. I don't know if this is the case,
but it's the only thing I can think of. Check what is happening, and let
me know.

I haven't seen kconnect, but mex works just fine.  Tell whatever
that you connect with that your terminal is an

Try using either adm3a or vt52. I don't recall which, but either of
these should be ok for Kaypro.

     You only need RASM/LINK if you're going to re-assemble
HEADENTR.A86.  You can alter the system to your hearts content with
CDOSINST and the appropriate XIOS.CON file.

     Do you have documentation for this?  You DO know that you're
supposed to use GENCCPM to re-generate the OS?  Ok, then.

     Now, both RASM86 and LINK86 are *NOT* public domain.  They are
copyrighted software packages, and as such cannot be passed around.
What you need to do is to find a copy of the "Programmer's Utilities"
package for CP/M-86.  You'll find RASM and LINK there.

     Oh, BTW... RASM 1.0 will *NOT* correctly assemble HEADENTR, nor
will LINK86 1.0 link it correctly.  In order to do it, I used RASM86
v1.3 from the Assembler Plus Tools package, and LINK86 v1.02 from my
copy of DRI's C compiler.  This was forced on me because the
XIOS320.CON file supplied by CompuPro won't allow a PC-DOS partition
due to a bad media byte.  I had to re-assemble it.

     If you can tell me what you want done, I suppose I can assemble
it for you.

Two things: the address is rna%pallio.uucp@xait.xerox.com - lakart is where
it _USED_ to be, but they went of line about 18 months ago, and pallio now
talks directly to xait. PLEASE DON'T USE lakart.uucp, because it probably
won't work.

Also, the lines would be:

/send help to address
/send index to address

where 'address' is your address in '@' syntax for domain sites, or '!'
syntax for UUCP hosts. The '/' is important, and the first three words
must be in lower case.

BTW, the site that I use to resolve '@' addresses understands
USER@HOST.BITNET, so bitnet users can get this stuff without any fuss.

Hi,
Can somebody tell me how "hard" the CR/LF sequence is built into CP/M?
I'm asking this as I want to read a text-file line by line and need a
definite place to terminate the line.
UNIX uses a single \n, but with a two character sequence, I'm not sure
if LF is always the last character and the second last character is
always a CR which I can discard.

Regards,

     It's not built into CP/M at all.  It's just that most terminals
and hardcopy drvices of the time required both the CR and the LF to
get to the first position on the next line.

     Why don't you just scan for the CR?  If you find one, then look
at the next character.  If it's a LF, then throw it away.  If it's
not, you've got a weird file.

     You could always therminate the line at 80 characters or CR,
whichever comes first.

IMHO, the best idea is to scan for a LF.  If you find a CR, then
ignore it.  This means that you can read in text files that were
produced on Unix/Amiga/whatever which only have LFs, directly.

If more CP/M utilities did this (UNARC does when typing a file from
an archive), then life would be much nicer, and I could throw away
my unix2cpm program.

Just following up to my own posting. . .

I have a new drive, an FD-55FV, which is a real quad density.  It goes nicely
just in case anyone cares about this type of thing.  I was told by the TEAC
local guru that it is possible to strap an FD-55GFR (1.2M) to act like a Quad.
Although I have not received the docs in the mail yet. Anyways . . .
They are really quiet as well!

I hate to post blind to a newsgroup, but here goes:

A friend who doesn't have news access just acquired a cp/m machine 
  (a Kaypro 4) and knows nothing about the os.  Can someone direct him
  to good books, PD software sites (preferably ftp) and send some good
  general information?

The name of a good PD terminal program would also be greatly appreciated.
  Any email can be directed to jwarren@hmcvax.{bitnet | claremont.edu}.
  Thanks in advance.

Hello u Kaypro'ers:
ADM3 is the stock terminal type for Kaypros, unfortunately, my VAX here don't
support anything but VT-type terminals.  There is an emulator on SIMTEL if you
can access it.  Other wise the MAXROM 84 from microcornucopia will give you
VT52 emulation in ROM.  I got it a few months ago & have had no problems with
at all.  Actually, I just got a quad drive for 50$A and now have 780K storage!
I love it.  For 79$US it's a fair deal.  Anyways there you go . . .

I have looked at this and have more information.  But as of yet,
no one has replied.  Again, if anyone out there knows anything
about this device, PLEASE tell me.

It has three rs-232 type female connections on the back.  These
are labeled, modem, printer, and terminal.

There is also a disk drive and a small indicator light which
says "virtual disk" next to it.

Hope this hepls someone identify this hardware.

Thanks

A quick and dirty method that I have used successfully in both DOS and CP/M
is to simply ignore CRs and use \n as the line terminator.  This will work
most of the time.  It even ports to Unix unchanged although it is a little
wasteful of the CPU checking for non-existent CRs.

Subject: Kaypro Termcap
Message-ID: <XX00011d1a@pallio.UUCP>

A couple of people expressed interest in a termcap for a Kaypro a while back.
There are two versions here, for the non-graphics (1983) Kaypros and for the
graphics (1984) Kaypros.  They should work just fine, but of course I don't
guarentee anything.  And no, the 500 ms. delay on the clear screen command is
not a typo.  The Kaypro 4 ('84) really does need it, even at 1200 baud!

You may also want to mess with a delay on the ce, cd, al and dl
capabilities, since they might take some time too.

Hi:
I sent a letter to them about a year ago to an address in
Microcornucopia from about that era (82) Anyways, It bounced and I
found a new address, (I'm not sure if it's different!)  But was going
to give it another shot.  I just really want the manual since I've got
the floppies & system stuff.  I think my compiler is stuffed because
it doesn't like Semi-colons at the end of lines!?  And spaces either.
Also, I just need a good reference over all.  Thank you for your help.
I'll get my version; I think It's 1.05?

See ya, Ronn

          ===========================================
          ===========================================

Hello Ronn, 

I've got a copy of the AZTEC II C (v 1.05) manual that you can 
buy for $20.00 (including S&H in the USA).  I've had it for some 
time and I never really got to use it, so I might as well let 
someone who wants it get to use it.
 
Also, I sell the MIX 'C' compiler for CP/M.  It is a full K & R 
implementation of the 'C' language that comes with a 
tutorial/manual which, in my opinion, alone is worth the price 
of the package.  Price of the package is $20.00 plus $5.00 for 
S&H in the USA (CA must add sales tax).  It's a true bargain for 
the beginning and intermediate 'C' language programmer.  Since I 
support TeleVideo CP/M systems on my BBS, I only 'stock' the 
software on TeleVideo (5.25" DD,DS) formatted disks.  If you 
cannot transfer to your disk format, I can put the software on 
almost any UNIFORM supported format for $2.50 per disk (2 disks) 
or I can arrange for you to download the software from the BBS 
directly to your computer.  

If you are interested in either or both of the above items, you 
can contact me in one of the ways listed below.  Take care.

   Well, in theory you could use a 1.2 meg drive as a 750k drive, but it would

   the ibm 1.2 meg drives have the equivalent of 8 inch drive electronics,
at least a subset.

   a nifty thing you could do if you wanted to use the 3.5 inch drives,
a 3.5 inch 720k ibm drive is electrically the same as a dsqd 96tpi 5.25
inch drive.

   problems with going the 1.2 meg drive route....   the tracks these drives
write are substantially narrower than even the dsqd drive tracks, to say 
nothing of the dsdd tracks.   also, the write current is also greater.

   these drives can write an ibm 360k format, but the chances of another
type of drive reading it is about 50/50.

   if you already have a 1.2 meg drive, see if you can trade it either for
a real dsqd drive, or for a 720k 3.5 inch drive.

I was just given a NorthStar Advantage by a friend (at least
I think it is an Advantage, the Horizon had the Terminal in
a seperate unit, where as my system as the terminal and cpu
and disks all togheter).
        I am looking for a book disk for the beast.  It seems
to work OK, it's just that I do not have a book disk to test
it with.  It keeps telling me to put a book disk it.
        If someone out there has one, I am willing to pick
up the postage and cost of the disk.  I'd like to at least
see if the beast is working.

I recently acquired a Sierra Data Sciences SBC and system and have a 
teeny tiny problem.  There are two serial ports on teh board, clearly 
marked as to which is a terminal port and which is the printer port. 
The problem is that there is a largish number of jumper points directly
below the header on the board, which I must assume are there to configure
the port characteristics.  I have no idea what the jumpers ought to look 
like, and my clone won't talk to it, or vice versa.  The monitor listing
implies I don't even need a disk to get the board talking, the jumpers
may have been set for some really bizaare terminal.  My clone only requires
a three-wire with 6-8-20 jumpered to make my modem do its magic.  

Dies ANYONE out there have a jumper layout for this beast?  The PC traces
to the jumper block are not at all obvious, and my familiarity with a
Z-80 DUART is academic at best.

Thank much in advance.

... and she wants to connect to various computers.  The Kaypro screen uses
a superset of the adm3a terminal commands.  In other words, Mex, Kermit and
other modem programs will (should) work fine if you tell your host that you
have an adm3a.  Unfortunately, that is a rather slow and limited set of
commands.  The following termcap and terminfo entries have worked well for
me over the last few years.  They make use of the Kaypro's extra features,
such as insert line, delete line, clear-to-eol, etc.

To use the termcap entry, save it to a file such as /home/me/kaypro.tc.  Now
tell everyone about it by typing
	setenv TERM kaypro; setenv TERMCAP /home/me/kaypro.tc
if you use C-shell.  In Bourne or Korn shell, type
	TERM=kaypro ; TERMCAP=/home/me/kaypro.tc ; export TERM TERMCAP

To use the terminfo entry, save it to a file such as kaypro.ti.  Now, set
your terminfo database to your own directory by typing either
	setenv TERMINFO /home/me
or
	TERMINFO=/home/me ; export TERMINFO
and then compiling the terminfo file with the command "tic /home/me/kaypro.ti".

No, I don't guarantee perfect results, but it usually works for me.

A friend of mine was given an Osborne one cpu.  The only problem is that 
they did not give her the cp/m system disks.  I have called Digital Research
and they told me that they no longer sell the system disks and that my best
bet is to try and find someone that has an osborne and ask them to make
me a set of floppy's and send them to me.  

If anyone out there has an osborne that could help, pls let me know.

  i apologize for this seemingly unseemless thread, but the local
piece of s--t mail system here keeps barfing this mail message back
to me, which really doesn't make a whole lot of sense since we
had this thread going in mail for the past 2 or three cycles.  (i know
it's a local thing because the system barfs the message within 10 seconds
of sending it.)

now, back to the discussion....

when this thread was so rudely interrupt by a flakey mail system, 
Mack Goodman wanted to know how to get his Companion (a cp/m 2,2
machine) up and running, mainly because his northstar advantage
didn't know what to do with a soft sectored disk.

---
   well, the companion would be able to read and write soft sectored
disks with no problem, assuming you could find a boot disk for it.
if you can find such a disk, then you would be home free.  just gut the
ns advantage and use it's disk drives for the companion, and term software
on the ns itself.

   whether a system uses hard sector or soft sectored disks is mostly
a function of the controller.   check the controller in the advantage and
see if it uses a 179x or a 765 chip.   if it does, then it's a matter
of software.   if it uses discrete logic, or one of the 177x controller,
then you're out of luck.   i say 179x and 177x meaning the series, as there
is a 1791 and a 1793.  same for the 177x series.  the differences is in the
interface electronics, but both are the same from a software point of
view.

   if you are knowledgable about cp/m and assembly language, you can do
one of two things...  either configure cp/m for the companion, or rewrite
the bios routines in the advantage to allow the use of soft sectored
disks.   and, if you can find a bios listing for a kaypro or other good
cp/m machine, you could hack that until it works.   this is basically
how products like uniform work, they replace those sections of the bios
with code similar to the machine it's trying to emulate the disk format.

   for the advantage, if it uses a 179x controller chip (like most decent
cp/m machines do) then all you would need are the addresses of the controller
ports.   get a bios listing for sometthing like a kaypro, and just change
the addresses in the bios to point to the right place.  do this in ram
with ddt and sysgen it onto a disk, and you would have yourself a boot disk
for any floppy you want.

   for the companion, you would do something similar, except you would have
to find the ports addresses, and since you don't have any docs, that can
be somewhat difficult.  what i would do is open the machine, and look
at the circuit board traces to see what address the controller chip
is located, and go from there.

   once you get a disk system working on the companion, the rest is easy,
since then you could do your system exploring via software on the
machine itself, which is much easier in my opinion from doing it from
circuit board traces.

   where are you located at??  you might be able to find a cp/m machine
cheap, and you wouldn't even need to do some serious hacking to get it
working, either.    unless it is something you like do, which is why
i go through this sort of torture.  (one man's pleasure, another man's
pain...)

   i don't suppose a month goes by where someone offers their cp/m machine
to me for the price of hauling it away.  if you look, you can find some
real bargains out there...

Don't forget that the old sugart 400's that came with the N* only have
35 tracks, as opposed to 40.
Also the WD1771 only supports single density (and single side). It will of
course handle an 8in floppy such as sugart 800 for a wopping 256KB.

Not if you happen to have a bunch of 1.2 meg drives hanging about... :-)

Not true. 80 tracks is 80 tracks, right? They get the extra capacity by
running at 500 KHz data rate instead of 250 KHz used by dsqd.

The only real problem with using a 1.2 MB drive is that they tend to use
pin 34 as Diskette Changed rather than Drive Ready. This confuses most
CP/M machines. This might be jumperable depending on the drive. The 
alternative is to just ground it so the drive always looks ready.

The jumpers are setup so that you can swap 2/3 and 4/5, and play around
with 6,8 and 20.  In general, for a modem you want something like:

	o     o     o     o    o    o     o    o     o
        !           !          !          !
        o     o     o     o    o    o     o    o     o

You won't be able to follow the traces without an ohmeter, as some
of them are on the inner layers of the board.  If you want, I
can send you the wiring.  I'd send it now, but I don't remember it
exactly... 

I used to work for SDS, and have a complete set of manuals available,
as sell as a working 4 user system.

Hope this helps
