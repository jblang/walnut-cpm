I talked this week to Harry Suckow, the boss at Manx Software Systems,
vendors of Aztec C.  He admits that things have been in a shambles;
the problem is that he's been holding down consulting contracts while
letting minimum-wage hired help handle the orders.  Result, orders didn't
get handled, even when they were pre-paid, a postal regulation no-no
good for getting the Feds to shut down your business.  He has finished
the contract, discharged the baddies, hired all new people, and claims
that his order turn-around is now below one week.
  Technically, this compiler is great.  It really does define all of
Kernighan & Ritchie -- not only the language, but just about all of the
library functions, too.  I used this product to write a BASIC compiler --
heavy on the static initializers -- and am so happy with it that my
company is negotiating an OEM agreement to incorporate it into our
utility/translator packages.
  One of my colleagues at another company sent an authorization to his
purchasing department to buy an Aztec C II compiler (includes floats
and longs).  Within two weeks he held it in his hands.  It appears that
Manx is now open for business.

I have uploaded the following files to MC:

		AR70:CPM;FNCFNT COM
			 FNCFNT HEX
			 FNCFNT DM1
			 FNCFNT DM1HEX
			 FNCFNT DOC

These files can be used with an Epson MX80 or MX100 with Graftrax or
Graftrax Plus roms to illustrate the print quality available with the
Fancy Font software package. A 48K or larger CP/M system is required.
Note that the DM1 file is binary and therefore has been hexified for
those who cannot FTP binary files.
I will try to answer any technical questions I can. My only connection
with this product is that of a very satisfied user.
I hope to be uploading more Epson-specific files to AR70 in the near
future.

A friend just bought a used "ICOM Attache", made by
Pertec.  It is part number 200801.  It has a 10-slot
S-100 mother board, power supply and very nice ASCII
keyboard (MITS "AEA Keyboard" part number 200814-1).

Also included was a video board number 1 (part number
200081-800-B) and video board number 2 (part number
200082-800 rev. B).

This unit looks similar to a large typewriter when its
lid is closed.

Can anyone help with schematics and/or instruction book?
The drawings for the video display boards are especially
needed so we can figure out how to make this into a working
microcomputer.

I've uploaded "ar36:cpm;long 1crl" in proper binary format.
So far I've only gotten four self-addressed stamped 8" disks for v1.50
test version return. Here's something to tempt you with: David Kirkland's
symbolic C debugger is going out with each v1.50 beta test disk. So send
TWO 8" disks instead of one. This debugger does things like list out all
variables by name, local and external, knowing the difference between "i"
for different functions...prints out structures in their proper structure,
breakpoints by line-number-in-function and position-of-expression-in-line,
etc. etc. An incredibly neat hack.

Well, it's official: Lifeboat's exclusive is a thing of the past. They
signed the non-exlusive contract several days ago, going into effect
immediately. Thus, the BDS C User's Group is now selling the compiler
directly. I've had several inquiries for the address of the User's Group;
here it is:
	BDS C User's Group (Robert Ward: coordinator, Sheila: sec'y)
	PO Box 287
	Yates Center, Kansas 66783
	(316) 625-3554

Was visited today by Masa Tasaki, director of Lifeboat Japan. GOOD MAN. He's
working on breaking totally free from Lifeboat NY, and I did my part to help
by signing a direct distribution contract for BDS C in Japan (I gave him
an exclusive for Japan, but at least this time my contract has a 90-day
termination clause! I don't expect to use it. The guy was good vibes all
the way.)

it just called MODEM769.HIS, thus reflecting the what the most recent

I feel that I have to add my two cents to the comments on c/80 (version II).
I tried to use it, and gave up in utter disgust. I have never gotten anything
of mine to compile, in spite of 4 years of coding C.

The problems I had were numerous. First, and most obvious, was the library.
Or lack thereof (I confess to being spoiled by Leor & Unix). What was worse,
the supplied printf (the standard C print routine) didn't work when you
told it to output hex. Since the CALLED routine unstacks arguments,
all functions have to be called with the number of arguments that they
are declared with. The contortions to get around this in the print routine
made it somewhat akin to hieroglyphics in readability. There are other,
more subtle bugs in the I/O library (then again, they may be in my code -
but it works under other compilers).

Second, you could not have unions declared outside a function. The compiler
(rightly) declares that you can't initialize a union. You then declare
one outside of a function, and it tries to initialize it to zeros. But this
is illegal...

Third, when the compiler runs out of disk space, it starts merrily dumping
its assembler output to the screen, with (apparently) no way to shut it
off. Since the compiler is written in itself, I assume that the same problems
will appear in user programs.

Last, and what I consider worst, when I spoke to the author about the problems
in his compiler, his attitude seemed to be `Why are you bothering me?'

Caveat: The version of the compiler I bought is (now) about 6 months old.
Some of the problems may have been fixed. Also, I do know people who have
gotten code to run with the compiler (after rewriting the I/O library from
the ground up). They STILL hate the thing.

Recently there has been talk of the various C compilers that

compilers. Is this because of the high price of it or because
its no good?

I ordered the manuals for the Whitesmith's C compiler back
when I was looking for a good C compiler for my CP/M system.
Several things turned me off to them. The compiler requires
60K to run. Becuase of this, you had to do a cold boot to get
back to CP/M. The compiler itself is a full C compiler, initializers,
statics, floats, macro subs, etc. ( I am not sure if they have
implemented the additions from UCB like structure assignments
and enum's) but what I heard from friends was that the
compiler producted 'buggy' code for 8080's. 'Buggy' was a relative
and obscure term. I do know that NONE of thier libraries
are compatible with UNIX libraries. They totally re-wrote
everything from printf's to exit's. Hence, nothing is really
portable, unless you just trash thier libraries. The price
was also, for a hacker, a little high.

	Having used it for several weeks now, i can recommend
the M.I.T.E. communications program from Mycroft Labs.  Mycroft
is Larry hughes.  He did the PLINK and some other modem type
stuff.

MITE isn't free, of course.  It does work, and downloads files
of all kinds, including binary files, even if what you're
communicating with isn't MODEM7.

It's also very easy to use and the documentatin is comprehensible.

The first version of the Whitesmith C compiler had three problems. First,
it was HUGE  (I have it from an insider that the compiler was never meant
to run on CP/M - it just happened to fit). Second, the I/O library mentioned
by tj@okc-unix.  Third - support (especially for CP/M) wasn't very good.

I never saw what the support for CP/M was like. I worked with the VMS version
of the compiler for a short while, and we had lot's of trouble with it, and
with support. Hearsay evidence  suggusts that the problem was agravated if
you had a CP/M version.  See the BDS C Users Group Small C distribution for
some comments.

There is a new version of the Whitesmiths compiler out. From what I have heard,
it fixes the I/O library problems and some (relatively) minor problems with
initializers that appeared in the first compiler. Since I've never seen anything
on the compiler, I won't garuntee these things.

As for the `ucb' extentions, I have never seen ANY non-Unix compiler that tried
to add any of the nice things added to C by Ritchie not documented in the
K & R book (structure assignments/passing/returning, enums), or the
ucb things (arbitrary-length assignments), or even the misc stuff from
other people (classes). It looks like K & R defined `C' for the non-bell
world, and anything added to the language after that won't be see anywhere
but on a Unix system. *sigh*

This may be a problem specific to my system hardware configuration,
but I thought I would mention it to seee if someone knows what's
going on. First, DDT has worked fine on the system up to now,
and as a matter of fact worked partially for 3 or 4 steps one time
during this bug. Now, what I have is a 44k system running in 48k
ram, (the top 4k reserved for programs like BYE).
I just recently tried to test a program using the TRACE and
BREAKPOINT functions, and what I appear to see is the very first
instruction execute, then the system hangs, and I have to re-boot.
The instruction doesn't seem to matter, from an XRA to an LXI H,
I have run this on another system with the same files, and al
works ok, could this be due to my having only a 44k system??
I am not really interested in going too deep into this, perhaps
just a few hints/thoughts. I may just install another 16k and make it
a 56k or larger system. By the way the program I was trying to
debug was less than 4k in size...
Thanks for any help...

DDT, as I recall, uses a rst instruction to return control back
to itself when a break is encountered. I have seen that a few
CP/M systems like to use some locations in base page that perhaps
it shouldn't. It may be that this is where the hangup is at. if
a break is encountered, a rst x instruction gets run which causes
a jump to 0000 0000 00xx x000. if the instruction there is trash,
then anything can happen

I just received my Zpro upgrade to work at 1200 baud with the Novation
Apple-Cat II upgrade, and the only thing to say about itthat it is just
ust great. I have a slightly noisy telephone line, but all I get is an
occasio{. For those that don't know, zpro runs under CPM, supports
onboard and serial port modems, send and receives files under protocol
or straight, and does a host of other things such as terminal emualation
(I use vt52 or iq120 for emacs), macros, and auto login. The only thing
it is missing is a timer program with hooks to a clock.

If you have Zpro, send $10 plus your black box and disk to Southwestern
Data Systems. I did it with Express Mail, and had my disk back in 3 days
(the PO misses the delivery cutoff time in California, making one-day
service impossible). If you don't have Zpro, well...

Oh, you also need a 1200 baud modem. The Apple Cat II WITH the upgrade
is fine, though their instructions leave a lot to be desired. (They
don't have any, but you can call them at 800 423 5419 free.) For some
reason, Novation is a typical nouveau-high-tech company with an
excellent piece of hardware and friendly telephone types, but no ability
to support their product with written documentation. Curious. We have
six Novations and have had no problems (Hayes gave me lot of problems),
but we had to ask around to make the things work. Fortunately, Zpro does
most of that for you. In fact, Zpro is why we got Novation modems. If
they had any brains, they would give it away with the modem instead of
the awful Com-Ware which they include. But that's just my opinion.

Greetings.  I appreciate the fact that INFO-CPM isn't exactly 
the best place for this query, but given the nebulous state of
INFO-MICRO it seemed like a reasonable choice...

I'm looking for any information regarding the "best" C compiler
currently existing for the IBM PC.

I need to know:

1) Is the language implementation complete?
2) Does it generate reasonable code?
3) Does it compile with reasonable speed?
4) Does it generate object code or assembler source?
5) Is its stdio library complete?
6) Which OS does it run under?
7) Etc...

You probably know the sorts of issues I'm concerned about.  Any
information would be appreciated.  Thanks much.

Have you tried running the Lifeboat MEMR2 memory test?  It is a very
good memory test program.  Whenever I have unexplained problems with a
program that has previously worked, the first thing I do is run MEMR2.
Also, have you checked your DDT against 22CRCLST.DOC (my list of CRC's

I noticed your message to Leor telling about a "misfeature" in TYPE15.
You said if the printer was togged with the control-P when the file
was typed out it did not go to the printer, only the console.  This
was not a mistake, it was deliberate!  TYPE15 uses BIOS output instead
of BDOS in order to get around the *misfeature* in CP/M that causes it
to echo characters during output if any are typed.  This is particularly
important on a Remote CP/M system where it's likely that some noise
will be received by the modem while a file is being typed.  Your
solution is to recompile it using BDOS output -OR- use my "SWAP"
program which temporarily transposes the console and list JMPs in the
jump table at the start of the CBIOS.  Another way is to implement
IOBYTE and use STAT to reassign the console output to the printer.
Actually, if you have USQ (the Greenlaw UNsqueezer) you can say USQ -
filename.type and the output will go to the list device if you have
done control-P prior to entering USQ.

The Software Toolworks has a C compiler that (I think) will be out
for the IBM PC.
1) the compiler lacks:
	a) floats
	b) longs
	c) typedef
	d) #line
	e) arguments to #define
2) the code is fair.
(Faster than basic, har har)
3) the speed is Sloooooooow.
4) it produces assembly code. (with in line source if you want it.)
5) the stdio lib is not the most complete I have ever seen (understatement).
6) the printf is bad.
7) price $49.95
I like it,  it is cheap, and since I had to write my own printf and
my own stdio library I understand what it is doing.  Actually
the stdio isn't that bad, it has all the basics.

   .   Could someone refer me to more instructive DDT.COM
       documentation than is contained in Digital Research's
       DDT USERS GUIDE?  That documentation is fine for
       reference, but not for learning.  Is there a book,
       article, or (best of all) a file I could study?

   .   My immediate problem involves debugging a patch for a
       Text Processor.  The Processor will run ONLY when
       invoked with a filename on the command line,
       i.e., PROCESS filename <cr>.  I have not been able to
       figure out how to provide "filename" after calling
       PROCESS.COM into DDT.

  Will greatly appreciate someone who knows how to do that
  sending me a message with instructions.

when cp/m reads in a .COM file to execute, the command line which
was used (excluding the accual file name) to invoke this is placed
at 0x80. the first byte (0x80) indicates how many bytes following this
(0x81 to 0xff) came from the original command line. also, the first two
arguments in the command line are assumed to be files and cp/m
creats two File Control Blocks (I for get the accual address, somewhere
between 0x40 and 0x80) thus making it convenient for the new
program to go and muck with either of these two files. the FCB's
overlap, so only one can be used. if you want to use both, one has
to be moved someplace else. invoke DDT with come bogus arguments and
then tell it to display the base page. the format it simple.
so, what it seems you'll have to do is manually set the base page
up each time, or else set it up once, move that part to 0x100,
G0, save 1 foo (or is it save foo 1?)(blast SDOS!) and then
read in foo each time and move it back to base page.

Thanks for all the response. As far as I am able to

had the problem. Then left the system alone a while,

I mean success only in that I could trace, beco....
because I found that when the trace was working, I
coi   could not Dump or List, it would simply
breakpoint ah  again  (sigh). I think I will quit
while I am still behind...... Thanks again..

P.S. I left a TYPE15 update type wish list on the SYSOP sys.

There is a DDT command to parse a filename and set up the default first FCB, but you can
only specify the default drive (first FCB byte=0).  The command is I if memory serves.

While Whitesmith's C is expensive compared to other comparable products,
it would be a bargain if it were a full implementation of the language
compatible with Unix and if it were easy to use.  It is neither.  In
addition, Whitesmith's support is indifferent, as I will document below.
But first, here's how you compile something using the CP/M version:

[from memory -- subject to slight inaccuracies]

A>pp test.c -o test.tm0
A>p1 test.tm0 -o test.tm1
A>p2 test.tm2 -o test.8
A>an test.8 -o test.r
A>ld80 -o test.com chdr.r test.r clib.a mlib.a .... (ad nauseum)

Naturally, all of the above can be done using a SUBMIT file, or one of the
other, superior utilities of that sort.  But it takes a helluva long time!!
The library searches are all done on the disk, as is all the intermediate
data storage, etc.

Compare the above with the following for BDS C:

A>cc1 test.c
A>clink test

Also, the compatibility with Unix is lacking, especially in the I/O 
department.  When I was contemplating purchasing Whitesmith's C and
Pascal for one of my company's PDP-11's running RT-11, I called the big W
and inquired as to whether they would ever implement printf() as Unix
does.  The response was a very haughty "I doubt that we'll ever implement
printf().  Our putfmt() is a much superior grammar."  [I wonder whether
Dr. Chomsky would agree with him.]  In any case that response was from
a fellow named who was not there the next time I called after I made
the mistake of buying the package.

The problem at that point was that I wasn't able to use the only program
segmentation facility available to memory-starved RT-11 systems, that is
overlays.  The reason was that Whitesmith's generates unnamed .PSECTS in
their object code output, which have the wrong attributes by default.  When
I asked the boys at Whitesmith's what I could do, their response was that
I could "edit the assembly code generated by the compiler" (obviously a
ridiculous solution).  That was not as bad as it got -- actually even if I
HAD edited the MACRO file, I would have still had default .PSECTS in the
library (CLIB) which I did not have the source for.  I was advised by 
Whitesmith's that I could correct that situation by purchasing the source
for the library for ~~ $3000.

The big problem is that Whitesmith's really only gives cursory support
to anyone using an OS other than their own IDRIS (have you ever met anyone
who used IDRIS?)  One of their people admitted this to me during one
of my calls.

You mentioned their Pascal "compiler".  Actually it is a Pascal filter,
translating Pascal source to C (which, of course, adds one more pass to
the busy work described above).  First of all,  it does produce buggy object
code, as I found out first hand with the RT-11 version.  Secondly, it is
pretty close to Wirth-Jensen, which means pretty close to worthless.  Finally,
when I called them to ask specific questions (in advance of its purchase) the
person on the phone told me that he couldn't really tell me much about it --
that most people buy C and then they think it is a good idea to tack on $100
or so to get Pascal.  He gave me the impression that it was an extra bone
in the soup and no more.

From what I have seen of code generated by the CP/M version it is quite large.
I really fail to see where this overpriced compiler will ever do me any
good.  I have been using BDS and have nothing but good things to say about
it.  If you can get along without longs and floats, definitely buy it!

THE FOLLOWING NOTE COMES FROM DOUG DURLAND:
- - - -
 
if anyone else was interested in acquiring a BIGBOARD II.

The pertinent information is:

Manufacturer: CAL-TEX COMPUTERS, INC.
	      780 East Trimble Road
	      San Jose, CA 95131
	      408-942-1424
The Corp. consists of J. Ferguson, R. Smith, and Bill Siegmund
Ferguson and Smith were the designer/software writer for the 
original BIGBOARD distibuted by Digital Research (Texas)
Bill is the local assembler/trouble shooter/document writer/etc.

Board characteristics:

	4 Mhz Z80A
	64K DRAM, 4k static ram, 4k EPROM (monitor) with sockets
	for up to 24K EPROM, static ram, or EEPROM.
	Double density disk controller, 5.25 or 8" (as the board
	  is configured, you cant mix - but this would be an
	  easy mod.  The clock freq. is all they change.)
	SASI interface for hard disk
	STD bus
	2 serial ports
	4 parallel ports
	2 counter - timer chips
	EPROM programmer on board. ( I have written some good 
	  software for it if you get that far )
	ADM 31 terminal emulation (its good)
	DMA

	Cost:  $245 bare board, $695 kit.  CBIOS $25

As I mentioned I had a bit of trouble getting mine up.  Some
board layout problems involving grounding (since corrected)
were quite a headache to iron out.  Mine has now been up for
about 2 months with no further trouble.  I purchased a Motorola
3003 monitor for $75 in order to be able to use a higher than
standard TV scan rate and get some super resolution.  It is
really beautiful.

Some comments on Whitesmith's:  

	(1)	It is very, very slow on CP/M systems.  The system
		I use has a Priam winchester and 32k of disk buffering.
		I would hate to see it on a floppy based system.

	(2)	It is a "full" C (e.g. has floating point in the language).

	(3)	It's faster (execution) than BDS C.  For compilation,
		BDS C is far faster.

	(4)	The entire I/O library is "wrong" - almost nothing
		is compatible with Bell C.

Hi,

  Here's my addition to the recent flood of C compiler info requests.  Has
anyone had any experience with the Q/C compiler from The Code Works?  

  According to the ads, you get a 'fully supported' C compiler AND the source
code for $95.  I'm interested in porting this thing to other processors if
I can get some assurance that it comes at least as close as BDS C in imple-
menting standard K & R.

	A bug in the routine to check the PMMI local command to change
baud rate has been found and fixed in the current version of MODEM 769ASM
in AR61:CPM; on MIT-MC.  A DIF file MDMFIX 769DIF also in AR61:CPM; fixes
the old version if you have a copy. NON-PMMI users need not concern themselves
with the bug.  The HEX and COM files have not been fixed; I plan to replace
MODEM769 with a somewhat enhanced version soon.

        Both CONFIG and TINIT are programs designed for  the  TVI
950  CRT terminal.  CONFIG is used to interactively specify how a
user wants his terminal to be programmed, allowing him to  select
between  five different cursors, various terminal attributes such
as key click, the text of his user line, and the text  programmed
into each of the 11 function keys.  It also has the capability of
writing the selections out to disk in a data  file  that  can  be
later  read by CONFIG or by TINIT, whose function is to read such
a data file and program the terminal (TINIT=Terminal INIT).

        Since CONFIG and TINIT are written in  C  and  are  quite
modular  in their design, it is not too difficult to modify these
programs to work for  other  intelligent  terminals,  such  as  a
H19/H88/H89 or VT100.

        In use, I typically maintain several .CFG files.  One  is
the  standard, general-purpose configuration file, one is for do-
ing software development in C (programs the function keys to  in-
voke the compiler, etc), one is for doing software development in
PASCAL, and one is for doing  software  development  in  assembly
language  (with different function keys invoking different assem-
blers).  There is also a configuration file for doing  text  pro-
cessing.

For a fairly good learning and reference on DDT (and the rest of CPM,
as well), a book by Morrow Designs which is essentially a clarification
of Digital Research's documentation has given me good service.  I use
it instead of the DR documentation, since it has it all and is much more
readable.  It doesn't cover SID, however - only DDT. There are examples
though, and a really handy section with all of the CPM calls defined.

As far as using a console command default string under DDT, about the 
only way is to manually set up the FCB using the S command, and the
CCP string at location 80h with the length in front (SID makes this
much easier with its direct text entry). Sorry - I don't think there's
an easier way.

The claim is tha Cache/Q will work in any CP/M 2.2 system. It will not
boot up properly under ZCPR, but I assembled a relocated ZCPR (C/Q
uses a CCP 600H bytes lower than normal) and was able to cold boot
under the stock CCP and then install C/Q with the ZCPR in control.
Actually, the system reads in a file called CCP.SYS and in theory a
system is not needed on the first two tracks to go from disk to disk.
This would allow booting a single density disk on the A drive using a
Godbout controller (normally forbidden since the BIOS won't fit.)
Problems - It appears that the author (Pete Roberts) developed the
system on a hard disk and forgot to do a drive reset BDOS call when
you warm boot, so unless CCP.SYS is located in the same place on each
disk, it will crash. This was news to Pete when I called to bitch. It
makes me wonder how someone can market a program without beta testing.
Another bug is that there is a routine to specify the file type to be
bufferred, with the option of inversion (in other words buffer all
 .CO? files or dont buffer any .CO? files for example) but this doesn't
work either. You can either buffer all files or none at this point. I
have been promised a fix on this as well. I would say that until these
two bugs are fixed, the buffering program is of dubious value. It will
buffer the directory, and that speeds things up slightly, but you need
a lot of extended address memory for it to be of use in buffering
files. My 20K of extended memory is barely enough to notice. Using it
without extended memory is probably a waste of effort, since it
buffers on a file by file basis rather than on a track by track basis
as does FAST.
Supplier is Techne Software, 3685 Mt. Diablo Blvd., Suite 130,
Lafayette, Ca. 94549. 415-283-6824.
I will report if and when the program runs as advertised; in the
meantime, I would recommend that you save your $195!

	A new version of MODEM7 is available on MIT-MC in AR61:CPM;
The files are:

		MODEM	770ASM
		MODEM	770HEX
		MODEM	770COM
		MCNFG	770ASM
		MODEM	770HIS

In addition MODEM 76LIB has been renamed to MODEM 77LIB for consistency.

	An explaination of the changes follows:

;10/10/82  Made the following changes:
;
;	    1. Corrected bug in routine to check local command
;		to set baud rate,
;	    2. Corrected bug in NEWFILE routine,
;	    3. Reordered the configuration section to make it
;		easier to change,
;	    4. Introduced two optional toggles:
;		a. backspace to rub - on/off,
;		b. send local command to remote unless special character/
;		   use local command locally unless special character,
;	    5. Give new configuration message on toggle,
;	    6. If text file open give message on exiting terminal mode
;		about possible buffer loss,
;	    7. Give error message on reset disk to R/W attempt when file
;		open,
;	    8. Give error message if no file open when DEL, NOL or
;		WRT attempted,
;	    9. Give error message if command invalid,
;	   10. Move PMMI dialing routines so they also can be overlaid
;		by non-PMMI user routines.			;P.L.Kelley

Two possible ways...your Pascal may (though I doubt it) have a neat
little routine called 'exec' otrr 'system' or 'chain' yththat does a load
and go of a com file.  Otherwise, the only way to do a chain is to
load the com file in memory wuititha  relocatable loader routine and jump
to it.  There are a couple of soon to be released software pacakges
that allow com files to be rubnn from other programs and then continue
to execute those programs.  So far they do not include pascal, and at 
any rate are not yet available to the general public.

PS: sooryrry about wierd typing...it looks ok here by I feart that backspace

Has anyone done up modem to run on the ozzie?  I have a loaner
for a week to test some of my software and I have to download
stuff from 8" system to the ozborne.  Also, any routines that allow
the initial download of the modem program would be greatly appreciated.
If that fails, does anyone have the information on what ports and masks
are needed by the RS232 port so I can hack up my own modem changes.

This ozborne came devoid of docs.

Thanks in advance.

I have just submitted to MC:

	AR24:CPM;FIND 2ASM
		 FIND 2COM

These are an enhanced version of Ward Christenson's program which will
report all occurrences of a specified ASCII string in a file. FIND2
requires Digital Research's MAC for assembly.

	Ward Christensen has been doing an outstanding job of explaining
8080 assembly language to the reader of Lifeline magazine.  I think that
the entire CP/M world could benefit from this series he is doing.  Ron Fowler
released his article on TURBODOS to the CPM world after it was published.
Is there any way of convincing Ward of doing the same with his tutorial?
If they were release in a LBR or ARC file, then each one could easily be
accessed for quick reference (i.e. in ARC one could use ARCTYPE).  Is Ward 
planning to do this?  Who could contact him and talk to him about it?

	The file MCNFG 770ASM in AR61:CPM; on MIT-MC has been
upgraded.  This is the user customizable configuration overlay file
for MODEM770. There is now provision for a message on execution which
tells the user the system for which MODEM770 has been configured. This
execution message can help avoid confusion as copies configured for
other than PMMI modems get passed around.

Just a note to thank you for SWAP.ASM - a fantastic idea. I integrated
your routine into the line editor I use for all of my work (a really
fine CP/M editor, based on the Rand Editor used in UNIX), and can now
dump any lines of text to the printer anytime I want, simply by
issuing the command SWAP, and of course can go back to the screen in
the same way.

That's a tremendous convenience when one searches a file of notes and
wants just a few words on hard copy. If you think that anyone else
might want to make the same use of your routine, I'll be glad to
supply the .HEX file and integrating instructions for the TSC Editor.

You mentioned some time back that you have a part-time RCPM
running now and wondered about MINICBBS vs RBBS.  I like
MINICBBS because it is small (about 10k .COM file) and simple.
It's available from me, free to any legal owner of Ward & Randy's
CBBS.  MINICBBS is best used for applications where message
handling is NOT the main purpose of the system.  I think it's
ideal for RCPMs where the primary purpose is file transfers.

Either RBBS or MINICBBS can be run in any user area you want.
This gives complete security of all message and support files.
The way you do this is to get SECURTY2.ASM, my program which
is a simple file loader.  You assemble it and rename it to
RBBS.COM or MINICBBS.COM.  The user executes it, it moves
itself to high memory, switches user numbers, opens and reads
your "real" RBBS.COM file into memory starting at 100H.  When
the read is done, it pushes address 0 onto the stack and calls
100H.  When RBBS or MINICBBS (the real one) is done, it jumps
to address 0 and the warm boot restores the user number to 
whatever it was before you changed it with SECURTY2.  This is
because the CP/M picks up the nibble at address 4 and sets
the user number to whatever was there.  Since our program
does NOT alter that nibble, everything is restored back to
whatever it was before RBBS or MINICBBS was executed.

CBBS is $50 - there is a form to fill out.  It's available
on many RCPM systems as CBBSFORM.DAT.  The price is a real bargain.
It comes on two 8" single density disks (or one punched for
use of both sides).  Lots of documentation and source code.

Have you tried Frank Wancho's RBBS31?  Some of the bugs you
mentioned have been fixed.

I have encountered the following using PLINK to transfer files to
Multics over an ordinary (non-network) dialup link:

1. PLINK appears not to accept console line editing commands in the
filename field, i.e., M<backspace>NEW will not match a file named NEW.

---This is because PLINK does not use the CP/M buffered-console input
   call.  Reason: it's possible to ^C out of that and lose your whole
   PLINK session.  I agree, it would be nice if the PLINK filename input
   accepted backspaces.  Right now, they go into the filename field and
   create a CP/M filename with ^H in it - NOT GOOD.  This is not easily
   fixed with the present routine.  Trapping control characters would
   make it ignore the carriage return that terminates in the filename.

2. When the line contains tabs, PLINK will occasionally die or lockup,
and you have to ctl-c out of it.  Expanding the tabs to spaces seems to
cure this.  This phenomenon appears especially pronounced when the line
is short, as when you have used tabs to generate whitespace in a very
sparse table.

---When you are sending a file with PLINK, if you are sending into a
   program that expands TABs, things get confused when you send them.
   It's better to PIP newfile=oldfile[t8] to expand the tabs before you
   send the file.  It would be nice if PLINK had a time-out feature in
   that area where it is looking for the LF character to know when to
   send the next line.  The time-out would have to look for (x) seconds
   of no characters received.  This could be a problem on time-share
   systems where there may be many seconds of no characters due to system
   load.

I'm looking for a pointer to articles or studies that compare C, Forth or Pascal
compilers that run on micros, such as Z80, 6800 et al, 8085, 8086.  I prefer
something that is 8-bit rather than 16 bit in nature to keep costs down (this is
for large volume).

The kind of comparison I'm looking for is execution speed trade offs, in hard
numbers, not just "I think Forth is twice as fast as Pascal".  I'm willing to take
forever to compile (probably on other host machines), but want to run fast, and
don't need an OS (in other words, ROMable).

So, does Forth run faster than a good C-compiled module, or is it just compact? 
And does it make sense at all to compare these languages to hand-coded
assembly?  My guess is yes, and that someone out there knows the exact
numbers.

There is a FANTASIC modem program called OTERM400 available for
the osborne.  Written by Mike Rubenstien - it incorporates
Ward Christensen protocol, CRC, and CIS protocols too.  Also,
when you are in the 'local' mode, all modem i/o (suppose you go into local
while 'type'ing a file) goes to a window.  It is really nice
from what he says, and others say.  I don't have an ozzie so I can't
vouch for it.  Now all you need is to find somebody with an ozzie
who has a copy of OTERM400!

interested in pro/con opinions so I can pick the best.  I can 

summarize for INFO-CPM if there is enuf interest, or even 

organize a group purchase (I can get dealer prices, but the more 

the less, if you see what I mean).



     Does ANYONE, ANYWHERE have causes/fixes/ideas on the 

WordStar problem where it crashes during flying leaps around a 

memory mapped screen running wide (160+) character texts?  I 

upgraded an IMSAI VIO to run 4 MHz precisely for this 

purpose, and now I find WS screwing up.  I'm going bonkers.

Just for the record, I got hold of a CERMETEK 212A, and it would not
run at 600 baud to my PMMI in 103 mode, guess I will have to try
the VADIC. I am still looking for a 212 modem that has auto-answer/
auto-dial, and is not so "smart" that it cannot run 600 baud in 103
mode to a PMMI (after all if PMMI can do it, why not others?).
p.s. I don't want a modem that requires my mortgaging the farm to 
pay for it...

I think this problem should addressed:
Many C compilers claim V7 UNIX compatible.  In many cases this is
not as great as it seems, and in some cases an inaccurate statement.
For example,  Whitesmiths C claims v7 compatibility, but there are
subtle differences that make porting very time consuming.  If
I bought a compiler that said V7 UNIX compatible, I would expect
the stdio library (standard i/o) and the printf and the 30 or
40 other things that people expect in a V7 C library to work
without change.  It is not acceptable to edit every printf
in a 3000 line program to make it work right.  I expect to be
able to take a program off a V7 system and have it compile and run
(Of course this excludes UNIX specific things like syscalls),
all the math libraris
all the math libraries should work etc, etc.  I haven't seen a
compiler for a micro that will do this.  I am assuming machine
independent code of course.

There are at least two "pseudodisk" systems.  Both work.
Semi-disk works with any s-100 system (and also with trash-80
mod 3 and IBM pc) and any controller (using cpm-2.x).  The
Godbout M-drive or Warp Drive works only if you have a DMA disc
controller, preferably Godbout CompuPro Disk One, AND the
CompuPro 8085/8088 dual processor board.

The Semi-disk is dedicated memory; it is ONLY the "N=Drive"
(ours is tagged as drive 'N').  The Compupro Warp Drive (we have
named it Drive 'M' in our system) consists of ordinary memory
addressed properly plus a program to let you access it in the
right way.  It costs more than semi-disk but you can use the
momory when you use the 8088 (or go to an 8086 or whatever) as
ordinary memory; something you can't do with the N-drive
semi-disk.  Semi-disk is cheaper, and you can get more of it--up
to a megabyte.  We have 500K N-drive and about 256K M drive and
we like both.  They're fast and if you do  much assembly or
compiling you'll LOVE them...

See my BYTE peices for more details.

Will the new modem 7 stuff work with the Osborne OTERM 3.03?

What files constitute a full modem7 set?

Finally, here's my problem...I have been using modem926 for a while
and am now trying to get it to talk with the Osborne.  I can get
the programs to talk together beautifully in terminal mode, but can't
seem to do file transfers between my modem926 and either oterm303 or
the modem216 in the osborne subdirectory.  Since I can talk in terminal
mode both ways, I assume that the modem programs are set up correctly
for ports and masks and such, but I can't send files.

HELP..I have to return the Osborne by Saturday and need to test
my system.

Thanks in advance,
David

The maximum rate at which my Racal-Vadic 3212P will work with a PMMI
locally (in 103 mode) is 550.  At that speed, a few bits are lost.
I tried it at 450 with Keith Petersen's system and was not very
successful -- only got semi-reliable transfers.

I'd like to make a comment on the general topic of disks that live in memory.
I think there is a better alternative: caching.

Instead of using that 256K for a disk, fix the bios to do track read/writes
into it, and then go there when you need something from that track. This
will give you about 40 tracks (15 512 byte sectors) resident in memory (at
least the version I run does) at any one time. You get the following
advantages:

	1) not having to shuffle the files to/from memory to get the speed.
	2) the things you use, as opposed to the things you think you'll use,
		wind up in memory.
	3) it's MUCH easier to get the stuff out to disk (I just ^C).

For example, with my system (320K cache, 4 Mhz z80), the result are nice. On
my current project (~750 lines of BDS C), the system only goes to the disk
for tools: mince and it's swap file, the compiler, and the linker. Other than
that, everything is resident in the cache.  This results in better performance
than a hard disk, even though I have the thing configured to verify after
every read/write, and to flush all the dirty buffers to disk on warm boot.
If I were really worried about speed, instead of reliability, I'd turn all
that off, and pick up 3 times the speed in I/O, plus an extra track buffer,
plus NO (well, most of the time) I/O on warm boot.

Of course, it's not all great - it isn't as fast as a memory disk, and
you don't get the extra 256K of online storage. But I like the increase
in safety.

As for getting it up - I've never looked at FAST (for obvious reasons), but
I seem to remember that it does the same kind of trick in the first bank.
If so, this could be modified (fairly easily, I hope) to cache to an extra
memory board (or two...)

We have two separate downloads of the RATFOR.FOR file and both
of them have the same set of redundant lines.  In function
OPENI, right after the line 23241, there are six lines that are
accidentally repeated.  I don't like munging about in the
Archives, so would the proper person make the fix for other
people?


The copy goes:

23241 if (.not.(i.le.8)) goto 23242
  namer(i)=32
        .
        .
        .
23241 if (.not.(i.le.8)) goto 23242

Please note that I just entered these lines by hand, and may have
missed something, but you get the idea.

Thanks,

I have installed Archive on my CCS CP/M 2.2, ZCPR 1.0, with Morrow M26
Hard disk system.  It seems to set the bits which it is supposed to,
and it seems to copy files in a useful manner.  There is a bug,
however, which someone may be able to explain.  When I try to write
(modify) a file which has had its archive bit set (a normal,
unprotected file which I have examined beforehand) I get the Bdos
Read/Only error.  When I type a ^c to get out of the error and go look
at the file, I find that the File Descriptor Block has all 0s in the
record allocation area.  When I try to write the file again I am able to.

The Archive BDOS patch is obviously the source of this problem.  Perhaps
the CCS BDOS differs from Vanilla CP/M in some way? I don't think so.  As far as I
know, the only strangeness about CCS is that they relocate CP/M an extra
2 k so that a 56K cpm has to be patched at 54K addresses.

Has anyone else had any problems or successes with Archive?

    I have followed the directions given below for the 80 track mod and
    all seems to work!

--Frank
--------------------

El Paso, Tx, 14-Oct-82

The following is a description on how to use full 80 track
capabilities of disk drives like the TANDON TM 100-2 on a North Star
CP/M system using North Star CP/M 2.2 Release 1.1.0.  The
modifications worked when I checked it out initially, but only
constant use of the 80-track system will reveal any bugs.  Therefore,
I can assume no liabilities whatsoever, nor guarantee that the mod
will work for your particular system in any way.

If you are NOT using dual sided drives capable of stepping 40 tracks
per side, or if you are NOT using North Star's CP/M rel. 1.1.0 QD,
then it is time for you to hit Control-C, otherwise read on.

The following steps will guide you through the modification:

1.  Prepare a SYSGEN image of the system you are currently using and
    name it SYS70.COM.

2.  Load SYS70.COM using  A>DDT SYS70.COM.

3.  With the "S" command in DDT make the following changes:

-S2C05
2C05 22 27 <= change max front side track from 34 to 39 (decimal)
2C06 ?? .
-S2C0B
2C0B 23 28 <= change max number of tracks/side from 35 to 40 (decimal)
2C0C ?? .
-S3013
3013 A9 C2 <= change disk length (max CP/M sector)
3013 ?? .
-^C
A>SAVE 70 SYS80.COM

4.  Execute the file SYS80.COM and put the modified system on drive
    A:, then cold-boot.  Your CP/M is now set up to utilize all 80
    tracks on a 48 TPI DSDD drive.  Please note than NO conversion is
    needed to use all 160 Tracks on a 96 TPI drive (such as TM 100-4).

5.  >>>>> IMPORTANT <<<<<
    You are now accessing uninitialized areas of a diskette.  You will
    have to convert all your diskettes from 70- to 80 tracks!  To do
    this, you will have to transfer the contents of one DSDD disk to
    two SSDD disks using the 70 TRACK SYSTEM, and then copy the files
    back to a freshly formatted disk using the 80 TRACK SYSTEM.  While
    this may be somewhat confusing and quite time-consuming, I think
    it is worth doing, since you get an extra 50k per diskette for
    your efforts.  The tradeoff is incompatibility of DSDD diskettes
    with others.  To remedy that, either exchange only SS disks, or
    reformat them when necessary.

To further test this modification, I will soon convert all disks on
the B: drive of the El Paso RCPM to 80 tracks.

						Happy hacking!


Oh, and many thanks to whoever enabled me to do this by providing me
with some insight into the workings of the BIOS.....


El Paso, Tx, 14-Oct-82

This file contains information on how to convert North Star's
FORMAT.COM to format 80 track drives.  As with NS80TRK.MOD, these
modification are tested but can NOT BE GUARANTEED TO WORK FOR YOU!

1.  Modification of FORMAT.COM (for N* CP/M 2.2 rel 1.1.0. ONLY!!!)
for use with a modified CP/M BIOS which allows 80 track drives:

This is the sequence of commands to do it:

A>DDT FORMAT.COM
 ....
-S1EB
01EB 45 4F  <= change max track from 69 to 79
01EC ?? .
-S72E
072E 37 38  <= change display so it says "... 80 tracks..."
072F ?? .
-^C
A>SAVE 9 FORMAT80.COM

This completes the conversion.  Note that FORMAT will still correctly
format single-sided diskettes.


2.  North Star has an undocumented feature in rel. 1.1.0.  This
    feature is the so-called "Nine"-drives.  That means that N* CP/M
    2.2, rel 1.1.0.  is able to control 96 TPI drives.  I have not
    been able to check this out, but see no reason why it shouldn't
    work.  You HAVE TO designate a 96 TPI drive as such and will not
    be able to use any other than a 96 TPI diskette on it.  To do
    this, answer the DRIVE-question in CPMGEN with a "N" instead of
    "D" or "Q".  (You can't fool the system - have to have a real 96
    TPI dual sided drive!)

    In order to format a diskette in "N"-format, you have to modify
    FORMAT.COM.  FORMAT.COM is already prepared to handle N-drives.
    It will even offer this function if you respond with "9" when
    asked for the disk format.  However, it's internal workings
    require your response to be "N", which is normally rejected.  To
    make it accept "N" instead of "9" and be able to format N-drives,
    use DDT to change byte 01F9H from 39H to 4EH.  Then you'll be able
    to use FORMAT.COM with 96 TPI drives.

						Again,
							Happy hacking!

to use the Osborne features and allows the Christenson protocol, Compuserve's
A protocol as well as dumb ASCIII capture and simple terminal mode.
OTSET is used to define strings for the function keys to be used with
OTERM.
I am not an Osborne owner, but if questions/problems arise, I can serve
as a go-between of sorts since Mike Rubenstein, the author, is active on
CP-MIG. Note that source is not being released at this time.

COPYFAST is the program you want.  It does full track reads and
writes, I believe.  It's available from most RCPM systems.  I don't
think it's available on MC:CPM, but I could upload if necessary.

If you look on an RCPM for it, look for CPYFSTxx (where the xx is the
version number).  I don't recall what the latest number is.

I have been put in charge  of arranging several sessions for  the
Fall  1982  DECUS  Symposium.   It  will  be  held  in   Anaheim,
California, from December 6-10, 1982.  The sessions include:

   RP07 & TU78 USER EXPERIENCE ON  DECSYSTEM-10/20
	This session will  be a "user's  panel" where RP07  and
	TU78 users will  discuss their  experiences with  these
	devices at their installations.

   INTERFACING A LASER PAGE PRINTER TO THE DECSYSTEM-20
	This session will  provide information on  how to  hook
	laser printers to a DEC-20  from one or two people  who
	have done it at their sites.

   PERSONAL  COMPUTERS  AND  DECSYSTEM-10/20
	This session will be a panel and audience discussion of
	interconnection  between  personal  computers  and  DEC
	10/20's emphasizing virtual terminals and file transfer
	software.

I need  session chairmen,  persons who  will introduce  speakers,
moderate the floor questions and discussion, and take (or better,
arrange for someone else to take) notes on the session.

I need session speakers, persons who would be willing to speak to
a moderate size, receptive group, about what they have done  with
regard to RP07's, TU78's, high-quality printers, and/or micros.

I am not  a member  of all  of these  lists, so  please send  any
replies to Clive@UTexas.

Gratefully yours,

	I passed Sigi Kluger's NS80TRK.MOD file on to Bob Plouffe.
After looking at it he quickly saw a need for compatibility with
70 tracks.  He therefore has a file that will easily enable one
to patch his NS BIOS for handling BOTH 70 and 80 tracks.  I will talk
to Bob and see how he wants to go about getting it to MIT.
(I still have to ask him about a bug I am encountering with
 ZCPR/NZCPR, so right now it works for standard CCP only)

Does anyone know why certain escape sequences might not work on a
Diablo 630?? For example, the manual we have says that an ESC-P should
turn on proportional spacing. It is listed in the chart as an
uppercase 'P' however there is a note stating "Uppercase letters on
pages 24 and 25 should be struck in lowercase mode.". I have tried
this with both upper and lowercase 'P' and neither seems to do
anything. I have similar problems with ESC-O (bolding), ESC-E
(underscore) and several others. Some escape sequences work correctly,
however. I know the printer is capable of doing those functions as our
Xerox-customized version of WordStar uses them. Is there anything
special that needs to be done to enable these codes??

				Thanks in advance,
				Rick

	After pointing out my previously stated problem to RLP, he
promptly found the error and now has his 80 trk mod set up so there
is no dependence on CCP.  I assume when he has completed it all, he
will upload the file so all N* users can benefit from it.  Remember,
with this you don't have to have 2 copies of CPM, one for each config.

Does anyone know anything (good or bad) about this computer?  My brother wants
to get a word processing system, and doesn't want the Osborne because of the
small screen.  The Kaycomp (or Kaypro now, I guess) seems to have the same
features, minus some of the software, but plus the large screen.  However,
it must be reliable and easy to use, as my brother is not a computer person.

Please answer directly to me; I am no longer on the mailing list.

Thanks for all of your help and responses with regard to

was one of the very first released, and as a result had some
subtle differences that caused screwups with the modem programs.

Again, thanks for your help

I've been installing UMODEM on our VAX 11/780.  If you have a C compiler
with the proper libraries, UMODEM goes on very nicely.  I've been using
EUNICE under VMS, and had to make some minor mods to get it up.  I have one
last routine to replace, and hope to have it running when the VAX and I
are up and available at the same time.

Richard, the "stock" 630 is not capable of such behavior as boldface
et al as you describe. There is a word processing enhancement to the
printer firmaware, but I have never lloked into ot for the following
reason: WordStar supports boldface, underscore, etc. on the 630 inn
software rather than hardware. It boldfaces by doing a backspace and
re-printing the character several times, for example. To obtain a
pseudo proportional spacing, WS ver. 3.0 has an undocumented
unsupported command. Try inerting a ^P at the top of the file (by
using ^PP) and you will notice a diffference. This is not truly
proportional since it has nothing to do withthe presence of a ps
printwheel, but the results are not all that bad.

Rick,

I believe that you will find that your 630 does not contain an option known as
the Expanded Communications Set Option.  The following is quoted from my
copy of the Model 630 Communications Terminal Operators Guide, Document No.
90445-03 (1/82), page 20):

"Expanded Communications Set Option (Fully Featured HPRO5)
This option includes several features which significantly increase the flexibility,
capacity and capability of the Model 630:

Word Processing Enhancements:  These consist of several features which allow
the operator to control the printout format from the keyboard using the ESC and
CTRL codes listed in the chart on pages 26 and 27.  Included are proportional
space printing, offset selection (character spacing), auto underscore, bold
overprint and shadow printing, auto center, auto justify, line edit and margin
control.

Expanded Memory:  
The print buffer (memory) is expanded to 2688 bytes (characters).

"Here Is . . ."  Answerback/NonVolatile Parameter Memory:  This capability is
supported by a small built iln battery which will maintain the data stored in the
RAM (memory) during periods of power off.  The "Here Is . . ." message of up to
31 characters forms an automatic identification reply to enquiries from another
system.  The Parameter memory retains such items as margins, tabs, modes, etc.

HyPlot Vector Plotting:  This feature provides the capability to rapidly produce
graphs and other vector designs, using commands listed in the chart on pages 26
and 27.  See the Product Description for details.

Remote Diagnostics:  This feature allows the interrogation of lmachine parameters
and status thru the serial interface."

So -- why does the Xerox-customized version of WordStar work correctly, you
ask?  Well, because it generates these functions internally to WordStar and does
not invoke them in the printer.  It does not assume that every printer attached to
it can execute these functions.

See your friendly(?) Xerox salesman and order your Expanded Communications
Set Option now.  How's that for a commercial pitch, and I don't even work for
either the Diablo Division or the Office Systems Division of the company.  I must
admit that I am a stockholder, however.

Hope this fully answers your questions.

Your memory serves you correct.  August  1980 Dr Dobbs contained the
Z80 source code for a 6502 emulator called ZX65.  I have a copy of the
executable in machine-readable form, but I can't FTP.  Since I got it
from some RCPM system, you should be able to obtain a copy relatively 
easily, but if you get desparate let me know.

In response to suggestions made by Fylstra/Rconn et. al., I have adopted
a new method of configuring the I/O port interface for BDS C programs
that require direct access to I/O ports. Note that pre-1.50 BDS C packages
had one header file, BDSCIO.H, containing all definitions; v1.50 has
BDSCIO.H for general definitions and HARDWARE.H for hardware-specific
definitions. The new port interface is in HARDWARE.H. TELED.C, the all-in-
one modem program and text editor (a real cute hack, it is) has been
modified to use the new header files and port access scheme. File summary:
	AR34:cpm;bdscio 50h	-- BDSCIO.H
	AR34:cpm;hware 50h	-- HARDWARE.H
	AR35:cpm;teled 12c	-- TELED.C
Feedback is welcome.

I'd like for it to implement accounting just like they taught it in
Elementary Accounting I for Bonehead Engineers, with:
  -- a journal
  -- a ledger, with automatic posting from the journal
  -- ability to generate a balance sheet and an income statement
I *don't* need inventory, payroll, A/P, A/R, just simple accounting.
Any recommendations?

ZDT is quite copyrighted.  It is available for some fee from Lifeboat
(sorry, that is the only place I have seen it.)  I bought it a while ago,
and I recommend that you attempt to find something else first.  Although
it does have some nice features (block compare, block move, etc.) and
I use it for those functions, it is a real pain to use for debugging because
it formats the input.  Instead of figuring out that 1F is 001F, you are
expected to type the whole 4 digit number in.  If you forget, it doesn't
work.  In order to list a segment of code, it makes you specify a range.
Thus, you have to do the computation to figure out how much memory would
fit on a screen.  I don't believe that I am overly lazy in not wanting to
have to think about such things when my energy should be spent debugging
my code, not guessing at memory ranges!

that the 630 isjust too smart for W*!  Aparently, W* demands a sort of total 
control over the printer & some of the smarts of the 630 just got in the way.

The solution was to semi-lobotomize the 630 by removing two of its smarter
chips.  Once this was done, everything worked just fine.  Since we do all of
out printing via wordstar, at least all that requires any funny formatting,
this is just fine & I don't miss the reduced functionality in the hardware,
since the software (W*) does it all.  

(n.b. "out" above = "our".)

I hope this helps.

I have a NorthStar Advantage onto which I am trying to put MODEM7.  My
current stumbling block is lack of documentation for use of the serial
i/o card in the second slot.  The USER.ASM file tells how to run 1200
baud, but until I demonstrate that the thing works I can get only a 300
baud modem.  How do I configure the UART in the second slot?  (Ideally,
someone will volunteer to send me a working MODEM7 source/com/doc on a
NorthStar readable 5.25 inch floppy that I can copy and return with much
gratitude.)  Thanks. Ron.

Actually, I am using NZCPR14, but I will take a fix from anyone.
The problem I have is that the .COM file search is not working
the way I expect. I have 3 drives, A: , B: , C: . The normal
default drive/user is A0, and I have SECURE enabled. I have  .COM
files of the same name on both A: and C:, and C: uses USER's 1-6,
with the .COM files in USER 0. When logged onto C: in User 1-6, and
I try to run one of the  .COM files common to both A: & C:, it
appears that the C: file is selected about every other time, with
the A: file getting used instead of the C: file. What I wanted was
the C: file in user 0 to execute every time if logged anywhere on
C:. Is this due to SECURE, a bug? or do I mis-understand the search
pattern as described in the doc..???? I would like the search pattern
to look like; 1)current drive/user, 2)current drive user 0, 3)drive A
user 0...it may not be quite that way, but what I mean is that the
current drive needs to be checked twice at least, prior to switching
to the DEFAULT (A in this case)..Is it me?? or what??
Thanks for any help. I realize the "REAL" ZCPR group is not supporting
the NZCPR stuff, but maybe a hint, or if it is a bug, a fix.

Heath 89 systems run an os from Heath called HDOS. The design
and implementation is very nice. It is not perfect, but cp/m
could learn a few things from them. also, there is not a whole
lot of software available for hdos, so i switched my 89 to
Magnolia's cp/m. This was relatively painless and not very expensive.
no more than for other systems. they send you a small kit with
diagrams and instructions on how to switch your system over. 
it took me about an hour or so and it booted up the first time,
amazingly enough. I have heard of some bad things about Magnolia,
but my experience has been very good. oh, this is standard cp/m
2.2.

        I don't have a solution to your problem, but it may be  a
thing  of  the past anyway.  ZCPR2 will be coming out soon (hope-
fully within a month), and it has user-definable paths which  are
much  nicer  than  the  old,  "crude" command-search hierarchy of
ZCPR1.  With it, you can specify each user/disk to search  expli-
citly (such as $$, $0, c5, b4, a$, and a0, which searches current
disk/current user to  current  disk/user  0  to  c/5  to  b/4  to
a/current user to a/0).  Also, combined with some utilities which
are coming out with it, you have a named directory structure  and
some  user  area  security  (directories with names like HELP and
PASCAL, say, and passwords required to move  into  System  direc-
tories [when the USER command is disabled]).

        This is just a teaser.  Please don't inquire further  ...
all information will be released when beta testing is complete.

quick & simple, and less than $2000.oo or so. Floppies are not the answer,
i have to nurse the system thru the back-up process. Most tame systems are
in excess of $4000.oo and not very usable. The best i have found is the 
Marshall from TKS Corporation at $3295.oo for S-100. It does what i want, but
at that price i could almost buy another 33 meg drive and back up onto it!

editor to respond correctly if at all.  For example:  ^F is supposed
to go into INSERT mode, for us it goes into SEARCH mode!
And the ^Q SUPER COMMAND (which will allow exit of editor to supervisor)
doesnt respond at all!  As a matter of fact the only command that
is recognized is ^M which is a non-destructive nextline command.

Any suggestions?  Have you had these problems?  What do I do?

Hi,
  Has anyone figured out how to grab all the characters shot down the line
by terminals likle the H-19 when one of the function keys is 
pressed?  I'm working on an editor (another one, yet) that needs to have
the ability to interrupt from screen updates to get user requests, but short
of having an interrupt driven system w/ring buffer or a Super ROM to slow
down the sending, I invariably lose characters.  The editor's written in
BDS C, by the way.

Thanks,
Doug

I recently purchased a Godbout 8085/8088 CPU and to my chagrin it
doesn't work very well.  I can barely get the 8085 to run at 2 MHz.

My system consists of an Imsai 8080, 128K of CCS dynamic memory, a Jade
Double-D FDC, and a CCS 4-port serial I/O card.  I have followed
Godbout's instructions regarding jumper and dip switch options, paying
special attention to those that apply to the Imsai 8080.  The strangest
thing that the CPU does is drop bits 0 and 7 when reading memory.  The
most flagrant case of this occurs when reading nonexistent memory with,
say, DDT.  Instead of all FF's, I get all 7E's!  Particularly
disconcerting as well is the lack of ability to execute an EI (FB --
has both end bits) since my BIOS is interrupt-driven.  Very weird.
At 6 MHz, nothing at all works; this was more or less anticipated.

I have shifted gears back to the original IMS 8080 card, which I'd like
to chuck soon.  Has anyone had similar problems with the 8085/8088 and
what are your experiences with Godbout's Tech. support in cases like
this (i.e., those that are beyond the capability of my "local dealer's"
technical knowledge)?  [I notice that Godbout tries to keep its phone
number out of manuals and other user documents.]

	PIPMODEM.ASM is a routine to modify CP/M-80's PIP to become a
communications terminal program as well as to download to disk a text
file from another computer.

	PIPMODEM.ASM is short enough that it can be easily typed in if
you have a printed copy or be hand copied from a display terminal
while in communication with a remote computer. The comments in lower

I have a copy of the Electric Pencil II text editor/formatter which I

There is a version I could use, but the vendor, Michael Shrayer
Software, seems to have vanished from the face of the earth.  Does
anyone know the whereabouts of Michael Shrayer, or does anyone have
version DS-II (Diablo, Sol, CP/M) of the Electric Pencil?  I would be
more than happy to send a blank floppy disk with a box top from my

program that I can't use anymore.

	You got it.  We had a bolus of 600 messages come in for Rand-Relay
at a time when UDel-Relay's Arpanet connection was very, very sick.
We do not have a TCP connection to UDel-relay, and the messages were
breaking their NCP, so I put them off in a hole.  When UDel was finally
fixed, I put the messages back, and they all timed out simultaneously.
The multiple instances of "deliver" pushed the load average up to 7.0
on Rand-Relay, and caused multiple outgoing copies of the returned mail.

	We have set up procedures now which will let us take over directly
the functions of a broken relay, so this sort of thing shouldn't happen
again.

driver listings, whatever) for the old Micromation
Doubler disk controller board?  I'd be happy to buy
borrow, pay for copying, or whatever is fair.

Any help would be much appreciated.  Call (703)-347-4799
(collect) thanks.

In order to handle fast escape sequences (of the form ESC-key), something
like the following might work:

TERMIN:	LXI	H,BUFCHR
	MOV	A,M
	ORA	A		; is a character buffered?
	MVI	M,0
	RNZ			; yes, return the character
TERMI1:	IN	STAT
	ANI	MASK
	JNZ	TERMI1		; wait for a character to appear
	IN	KEY		; read the character
	ANI	7FH
	CPI	1BH		; is it an ESCape?
	RNZ			; nope, return it as-is
	LXI	H,TIMVAL	; wait for another character
TERMI2:	IN	STAT		; ...calculate TIMVAL to that
	ANI	MASK		; ...this loop will time out
	JZ	TERMI3		; ...if an ESCape is sent alone
	DCX	H
	MOV	A,H
	ORA	L
	JNZ	TERMI2
	JMP	TERMI4		; if time-out, return only ESCape
TERMI3:	IN	KEY
	ANI	7FH
	STA	BUFCHR		; save next character in sequence
TERMI4:	MVI	A,1BH
	RET			; return ESCape

For the keypad keys, where the H19 returns a three-character sequence,
the time-out read could be placed in a subroutine, to wait for the 
fixed second-character value, and finally for the unique third
character value.  Only the third character need be saved.

I have been using the RT11/CPM interchange program, and it works fine.
My only real complaint is that there are no wildcards, each file
name must be entered if you want to transfer the file. I have used
it on 3 different CP/M systems with no trouble.

I have JRT Pascal but don't have the documentation yet.  It appears that the
RESET/REWRITE/OPEN construct is quite different from standard Pascal.  Could
somebody please send me the argument list for these procedures.  What
does OPEN do?
Thanks,

Can  anyone  suggest  a source for programs of  the  kind  listed 
below?  A  program package of this kind is available for the  HP-
41C(V) from Systems Exchange in Santa Monica.   However,  I would 
like  to run the programs on a CP/M based micro.   If you know of 
any  such  programs  that are available  at  a  reasonable  price 
(<$350) or free,  kindly advise.   Would prefer programs to be in 
Microsoft  BASIC,  Fortran 80,  or other commonly available  high 
level  language for CP/M systems.   Maybe you have written  some-
thing  along these lines for your own use and would be willing to 
share it.  Any and all suggestions will be sincerely appreciated.

PROGRAMS:
	Logistical Support Analysis	LSA

	Design To Cost			DTC

	Life-Cycle Costing		LCC

	Level of Repair			LOR

	Repairability and 		RAM
	Maintainability Analysis


I doubt that this kind of stuff would be of general interest so please
reply directly to me.
