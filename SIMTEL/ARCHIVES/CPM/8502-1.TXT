To withstall an question:  NorthSTar CP/M version 1.1.0 or later *IS*
required - this version has all the necessary drivers to handle the
'Nine' drives.  To see if you have it - run CPMGEN and answer the drive

The Scribble formatter, from which Perfect Format and the Final Word are
derived, tokenizes input and strips out 'garbage' characters such as
CTRL-H.  In practice and principle you can't embed ANY control codes and
special  characters directly in a .mss file and expect to see them in
your output.  You really don't want to do thie anyway, since it destroys
the printer independence that is one of the strong points of the
scribe-ish formatting model.

The method suggested by Perfect Software's old Berkeley tech support was
to define one of the extra printer strings, such as the italic on/off to
include a backspace. You therefore create an 'e' overstruck with a '`'
with something like:

	e@i(`)

Of course,  this creates some problems justifying things, since the
width of the grave accent gets counted even though it never really took
up a space.  You can make justification work if you only need to do a
few characters:  You include the CTRL-H and the grave-accent directly in
the italics string, doing the same with other special character and the
boldface, underline, etc. strings.  But you'd be screwed if you wanted
to use some of those attributes as originally intended at the same time.
(And I don't want to think about the proportional spacing implications...)

You'd be in slightly better shape if you have one of the MS-DOS Perfect
Formats, which handle MUCH larger TOCs and indeces, and have three more
special printer control string pairs as 'font1,' font2' and 'font3.'  I
don't know what additional flexibility is provided by The Final Word,
though it would be worth checking out.  The less said about PW 2.0 the
better.

Personally, I'd run with a PC Mince and a Perfect Format or a Final Word
formatter.

I have a number of things from the old 'Amythyst Users Group' that might
be of interest to diehard Mince hackers, and a (relatively) good 'C'
mode of my own design.  Reply via mail and I'll try to dredge it out of
the CP/M archives:  A) If there seems to be enough interest, and  B) I
can find a machine to read my old Osborne-1  disks.  Yes, I hacked Mince
with 90k drives, and it was VERY painful.

PUBPATCH *MUST* be installed on a STANDARD cp/m 2.2 bdos!

Jan Steinman and Paul Kelley have both reported similar problems--
files disappearing from the disk directory following the first
directory entry with 'E5' in byte 0.

Paul's problem was that his Heath CP/M 2.2.03 was *NOT* a standard
cp/m 2.2 bdos.  It contained this patch, abstracted by Paul:

;Patch at BDOS+0DEEH - End of BDOS
;Come here from GETALOC when first byte marked erased
;Speeds up allocation calculation
PATCH:	INX	H		;look at second byte
	CMP	M
	JNZ	GETA1		;if not erase mark, assume file entry
				;  and continue checking directory
	RET			;else assume we have found the region of
				;  the directory not changed since formatting
				;  and quit checking

		**************************
As we said in Dr. Dobbs, and in the PUBPATCH.ASM source, PUBPATCH
patch must be installed in a  *COMPLETELY STANDARD CP/M 2.2 BDOS!*
		**************************

Please recheck your bdos.  In the Heath case, Paul's version looked
like this:

Fragment from STANDARD BDOS2.2 routine to get the allocation vector
;
GETA1:	MVI	C,0FFH		;set the exit code
	CALL	NXTDIR		;set the next directory pointers
	CALL	CHKCNT		;was there one?
	RZ			;return if not
	CALL	PNTDIR		;point to the right spot
;HL now points to first byte of directory entry in DIRBUF
	MVI	A,DELDAT	;get the file deleted mark
	CMP	M		;is this what we see?
	JZ	GETA1		;keep looking for a nonempty block
	LDA	USRCOD		;get the user byte
	CMP	M		;test this against the first byte
	JNZ	GETA2		;if we don't match mark this block

	JNZ	GETA2		;if we don't match mark this block
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Jan:	Please let me know if this is, in fact, the source of your
	problem.
				
info-cpm list:
	The Heath code seems risky to me:  Anyone who, e.g., uses
	DU to clear a bad directory entry to E5's will end up
	unwittingly wiping out the rest of his directory.

I have several Z-80 based machines running CP/M and MP/M.  It would
be nice to network the machines together and CP/Net seemed like the
ideal solution.  Unfortunately, Digital Research no longer supports
CP/Net.  After many phone calls, I have been unable to find a vendor
who still has a copy in stock.

I would appreciate any leads on a place to purchase a copy of CP/Net or
suggestions of alternative networking solutions.

 You can get Microshell from 

    New Generation Systems, INC
    1800 MIchael Faraday Drive, Suite 206
    Reston, Virginia, 22090
    (703) 471-5598

 I would also check Microtools, and MicroTree. I just bought MicroTree from
 them (ls, cd, pwd, tree, mv, cp, rm, mkdir, rmdir) and it works very well
 (it maps user areas to named directories). I run all three programs under
  MPM-816, but I have also used Microshell and Microtools under CP/M-80, and
  CP/M-816.

 Note that they do not support Microshell under MPM , some things do not work
 well in this environment ( no line editor for example, and script files
 which cross user and drive boundaries don't work well).

  In spite of the problems I found when running Microshell under CP/M-816 
and MPM-816 (you loose the command line editor), the features you can use
make it worth it (input and output redirection, pipes, file and drive paths,
delay constants, customizable prompt, and specially their shell language)
 It beats SUBMIT, XSUB, IF,..., etc. 

 Of course, you can only run 8 bit programs under it.

 I have dedicated one user (0) in one logical drive in my Hard disk 
to COM files and microshell scripts, and have COM versions
of all my important utilities (SQ,LU,USQ,SD,FIND,GREP,etc). I keep the shell
as a detached process and attach to it on a different page of my terminal 
(Televideo 950 with 4 pages) any time I want to run an 8 bit prog.
 
When I got Microtree from New Generations they also included a copy of 
'cd.com' so I could change directories inside the shell. I might also order
the 8 bit version to be able to use 'cp', 'mv', etc.

There is a patch to submit.com (or BDOS or CCP or ...) that allows submit
to use any drive.  If no one else posts it and people want it, I'll try to
find my source.  I must warn you, though, that I called my home my "chaostle"
long before reading about Jerry P's "Chaos Manor", so anyone else who has
the document, please post.

Things I'm expecting to get by monday:
1. MINITEL (Modem-like) transfer pieces for IBM and look-alikes (+ Rainbow)
2. an updated NODE-list (weekly update currently) - Fido is growing by
	leaps and bounces (5 nodes per week).

Things I'm trying to get (but don't know yet):
FIDO versions for the IBM and lookalikes
FIDO-libraries (i.e.) "things" they make available and WE HERE don't have.

since FIDO (Tom Jennings) is LATTICE-C based (and source-controlled) - there
are NO SOURCES available for the time being.

FIDO supports MODEM7,KERMIT (and derivatives of both) - including a MODEM7
enhancement (time and date stamps) called MINITEL.

Is there a FIDO version for CP/M-80 V2.2? Is anyone working on one?

AHA!  It is not perfect!

1.  There was a tantalizingly incomplete article about testing different
aspects of floating point arithmetic in the last BYTE.  Has anyone got the whole
program in any and all languages?

2.  I tried the little program in that article in Turbo Pascal and Aztec C
1.06b.  Aztec passed, Turbo FLUNKED!

For me, good floating point is important.  This has me very nervous.  Kahn? 
If you are out there, please make sure that the floating point in Turbo is
as good as it can be.

The problem with bit 8 being set to odd provide odd parity is almost
certainly telenet.  Most communications programs will strip the parity
bit from the characters received individually before putting them on
the screen or checking them against special characters.  It is not
usually practical to do this is basic.  What you normally want for
any kind of terminal is to read 7 data bits, and ignore the parity
bit, but I dont remember offhand whether that is one of the basica
options.  there may also be a telenet pad command to set the parity
and number of databits desired, but I dont know what it would be
offhand.

Subject:  different CPUs

Hi,

I have a small request.  Whenever you send a message about a bug
report or wonderful new patch that you've written, PLEASE tell what
OS/CPU you are using.  On info-cpm you could assume that everyone was
using an 8080, but now discussions have branched out to include CP/M-86,
OS-9, MS-DOS, etc.  The problem is especially acute with programs like
Turbo Pascal that have been implemented on various CPUs.  A recent bug
report caused quite a bit of panic, but the bug is (apparently) only
in the MS-DOS version.  Thanks.

Since we USENET users can't get to SIMTEL20, how about
someone who has access to both USENET and ARPANET occassionally posting
the most asked for CPM programs (like (n)sweep, or du or findbad).

Posting of .com files could be done in uuencode/uudecode format.

I could sure use a CPM+ compatible version of findbad.

I found my CP/M patches, so I can promulgate the submit patch to allow
running from other than A:.  The current submit creates its work file,
$$$.sub, on the default drive, then looks for it on A:.  The patch
causes the work file to be made on A:.  That way, the search works better.

Using DDT, change location 5BBh of submit.com from 0 to 1.  That's it.

As a check, note that locations 5BCh to 5C6h contain "$$$     COM".

Look up the syntax of FCBs to see the rationale for the change (exercise
for the reader :-).

If you have a good library (personal or public), check out Microsystems,
Jul/Aug 1982 p 60.  There are a lot of patches listed there, for pip, asm,
movcpm, et al.

 Somebody asked me for an example of microshell scripts, the following includes
 a few of the commands and does not make use of any of the microtools.
 What I needed is a script to make the output of 'SD $SDALNP' more readable.
 I needed to set the printer margins,etc; form feed in between drive listings,
 I wanted the date, and the option to specify system and library files.

 I 'FILTER'ed the file to eliminate control chars (like ESC G4, ESC G8,
 ESC [ 1;96s, etc I use for my Televideo 950 and Qantex printer).

 The script is in a file called 'hdisk.shl' and it is invoked by the name
 'hdisk <parameters>'

Just modify the byte at 0004 - half of it contains the default drive number,
and half contains the default user number.  (I forget which half, but that
can easily be discovered by experiment).

Hi, Don,

	Sorry I took so long to respond (your message is attached).  Under
ZCPR2 and its version of ZEX, the case you describe is true.  Under
ZCPR3, ZEX does not monitor the prompt, but, rather, ZCPR3 leaves a
message to ZEX which tells it to resume input if it was suspended.  Hence,
the prompt itself is not of consequence under ZCPR3 and may be changed at

Chuck,
	Won't changing your system prompt to "A:!" screw up the way
ZEX handles input control.  If you use the "<uparrow><doublequote>" 
option in a ZEX file, ZEX turns control over to the console until it sees
a 'special character' pass by.  The special character in the distribution
version is a ">" with the MSB set.  It seems like that should leave the re-
mainder of your ZEX file pending forever.  Is that right, Rick?

   Could somebody with easy access to BYTE please put that program on the bboard
 (assuming it is not of unreasonable size)?  I don't get BYTE, but I do have
  Turbo, and I'd like to be sure of the status of the version I have, bugs
  and all.  
  
  If the program is too big for reasonable posting, I'll try some other way.

available on SIMTEL20:

Filename			Type	 Bytes	 CRC

Directory MICRO:<CPM.CPMLIB>
NULU11.LBR.1			COM	 56064  EFB2H

Here are some excerpts from the author's DOC file:

NULU is a complete replacement for LU and LSWEEP.  Weighing in at 15k,
it includes all features of both programs and then some.  It features:

	Two operation modes with a full menu for each
        LU style CRC support and verification
	Viewing and printing of member files, unsqueezing when 
               necessary
	Extraction of member files with an option to unsqueeze 
               where appropriate
	Bigger libraries, up to 800 members or more depending on        
               available memory
	Automatic member sorting, all members kept sorted at all 
               times
	Faster reorganization
	Enhanced error handling
	Access to deleted members
	Optional read only patch
        CP/M Plus support
	General compatibility with LU and NSWEEP syntax
	Numerous user patches

To the best of my knowledge, NULU will run on any system running CP/M
2.x or higher, however it has only been tested by me on the Osborne 1
and the Osborne Executive computers.  It is written entirely in 8080
assembly language.

Subject:  new simtel20 files

Hi,

The following Z80 Turbo Pascal files have been added to simtel20:

Filename			Type	 Bytes	 CRC

Directory MICRO:<CPM.TURBOPAS>
HELPPAT.DOC.1			ASCII	  3301  09BEH
PATCH.PAS.1			ASCII	  3297  550BH
SAMPLPAT.PAS.1			ASCII	  1583  17D5H

The file HELPPAT.DOC shows how to patch Z80 Turbo Pascal versions 1.0
and 2.0 with DDT so that the error message file is automatically
loaded without asking the user.

The program PATCH.PAS allows you to write Turbo programs that access
the CP/M command tail.  Turbo (as written) clobbers the command tail;
this patch program is run on a .COM file to move the tail to a "safe"
location.  It also dummies out some terminal initialization that .COM
files automatically do.

SAMPLPAT.PAS is a sample program showing how your program code must be
modified to use PATCH.PAS.  It also provides documentation for PATCH.PAS.

Subject:  new WordStar patch in simtel20

Hi,

The following file has been added to simtel20:

Filename			Type	 Bytes	 CRC

Directory MICRO:<CPM.WSTAR>
NECWSOVR.AQM.1			COM	 13312  B6C6H

This file is an overlay-style patch file for WordStar 3.0.  It defines
terminal control sequences for a NEC PC-8001 with color monitor,
redefines some WordStar control keys, lowers the help level and delay
times, and defines user commands (^Q, ^W, ^E, and ^R) and control
sequences for a NEC PC-8023A dot-matrix printer.  A custom printer
driver allows you to make use of the printer's Greek, mathematical, and
half-height superscript characters.  True super/sub-scripts have also
been added (sorry, no proportional printing yet).

The file is written in 8080 mnemonics and will assemble correctly with
ASM or MAC.  It is heavily commented so that you can delete sections
which don't apply to your configuration and modify what is left.  For
non-NEC owners, the 8023 is basically the same as the C.Itoh Prowriter
and Apple dot-matrix printers, so you should be able to adapt the
print routine.

The overlay does not change the size of WS.COM, but it does overwrite
sections with the new printer driver and Greek table.

I picked this file up from a local BBS this morning - thought the
net would be interested since it seems to have turned into a test case
on the liability of RBBS sysops.

---------------------------------

7AM, 02/07/85:
    PURSUANT TO A TELEPHONE DISCUSSION WITH REGINALD DUNN,
HEAD OF THE CRIMINAL DIVISION OF THE L.A.  CITY ATTORNEY'S
OFFICE, I WAS INFORMED THAT THE PROSECUTION BELIEVES IT HAS
INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE TO CONTINUE THE PROSECUTION OF TOM
TCIMPIDIS, SYSOP OF MOG-UR.  THIS DETERMINATION WAS MADE AFTER
I REQUESTED A REVIEW OF THE CASE ON 1/11/85 AFTER THE
DEPARTURE OF CITY ATTORNEY IRA REINER TO BECOME D.A., AND
WHILE THE CITY ATTORNEY'S OFFICE IS BEING RUN BY THE CIVIL
SERVICE STAFF PENDING ELECTION OF A NEW CITY ATTORNEY.  MR.
DUNN HAS GIVEN ME HIS WORD THAT THE PEOPLE WILL SEEK DISMISSAL
OF THE CHARGES AGAINST TOM UNDER CALIF.  PENAL CODE SECTION
1385, I.E., DISMISSAL IN THE INTERESTS OF JUSTICE.  UNDER
CALIFORNIA LAW, SUCH A DISMISSAL IS "WITH PREJUDICE" AND THE
PEOPLE CANNOT REFILE THE CASE SUBSEQUENTLY.  TO PUT IT
SUCCINCTLY, A DISMISSAL WILL TERMINATE THE PROSECUTION
PERMANENTLY.
    AS THE MEMBERS KNOW, THE CITY ATTORNEY'S OFFICE HAS
PREVIOUSLY RENEGED ON REPRESENTATIONS MADE TO ME REGARDING
DISMISSAL OF THE CHARGES....I WISH TO ASSURE EVERYONE THAT I
HAVE KNOWN MR.  DUNN FOR 10 YEARS, AND I TRUST HIS WORD
COMPLETELY.  IF HE SAYS THE CASE WILL BE DISMISSED, I AM
SATISFIED THAT SUCH AN ACTION WILL OCCUR.
     WE WIN.  WIN....WIN....WIN....WIN....WIN....MY THANKS TO
EVERYONE WHO CONTRIBUTED TO SUPPORTING TOM AND I IN THE
DEFENSE OF THIS MATTER.  I CONSIDER THIS TO BE A MAJOR VICTORY
FOR THE RIGHTS OF FREE SPEECH OVER THE "BIG BROTHER"
MACHINATIONS OF THE PHONE COMPANY.
     I WOULD BE GRATEFUL IF YOU WOULD DOWNLOAD THIS MESSAGE
AND PLACE IT ON OTHER SYSTEMS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY.....THIS
IS A VERY BIG VICTORY, AND THE BBS AND MODEM COMMUNITIES
SHOULD KNOW ABOUT IT.
     AGAIN, THANKS FOR THE SUPPORT.   BEST WISHES TO ALL,
                        CHUCK LINDNER
                        ATTORNEY FOR SYSOP TOM TCIMPIDIS

8PM, 02/07/85:
     THE CASE OF PEOPLE V. TCIMPIDIS, AKA USE A MODEM, GO TO
JAIL, WAS DISMISSED IN THE "INTERESTS OF JUSTICE" THIS
MORNING, 2/7/85.  AS NOTED EARLIER, THIS DISMISSAL IS WITH
PREJUDICE, AND TOM IS NOW FREE OF THE PACTEL SCOURGE.  ANOTHER
SMALL STEP FOR SOMETHING RESEMBLING JUSTICE.

Two questions:

1)  I recently downloaded the FORTH-83 (SIGM-204) from a RBBS.
    From what I can tell, it looks great.  My problem is that
    I'm used to a FIG-FORTH implementation, and I'm having some
    problems finding some of the old familiar words (it took me
    a couple minutes to find u*d when the old U* wasn't there).
    Is there any documentation, other than the "SHADOW" vocab-
    ulary available?  If someone has an online vocabulary list
    I would really appreciate a copy.  Also some info on the
    meta-compiler would be useful too.

2)  Has anyone already installed ZCPR3 on a Colonial Data
    Services SB-80 (running 2.2)?  If so, I'd appreciate any
    tips or help you might be able to provide.  I'm sure that
    given the time, I'll be able to do it, but why reinvent the
    wheel, right?

Thanks to any and all who may be able to help.

In reference to the news about NULU11.LBR available now in SIMTEL.

 I have been using  NULU instead of LU for several months
under CP/M-80, CP/M-816 and MPM-816 with no problems. It is an excellent
program if you use libraries. I am using them even more with a large hard
disk than with a floppy system. 

I have noticed only two problems:

- if you use NULU with libraries created with LU you get error messages 
   indicating that the directory has a CRC error. Just ignore the message.

- the second is a real bug- if you extract a library member and specify a
  destination ('du:file.ext'), and you enter the file name in lower case
  then you cannot access the file. Directory listings using SD, for instance,
  show the file name in lower case. Rename does not work, but you can
  rename the file using VFILE, SWEEP, or DISK77.

re: JEP's CP/M-86 BIOS

MY version of CompuPro's CP/M-86 won't even run submit out of
other user areas on the A drive!  Does CompuPro *ever* ship these
wonderful enhancements to anyone but JEP?

Still waiting for the TMX BIOS,

Subject: ITS-binary files at SIMTEL20 are no more

All existing ITS-binary files on SIMTEL20's MICRO:<CPM.*> directories
(those funny things with the four-byte header that most users have to
strip off) have been converted to standard Tops-20 BINARY.  What this
means is that you no longer have to strip the four byte headers on
.COM, .LBR, and SQueezed files.  All future binary files will be
stored in standard BINARY (8) format.  A new MICRO:<CPM>CPM.CRCLST has
been generated and should be available by the time you read this
message.  New CRCLSTs for CPMUG and SIGM will be made as soon as the
conversion has been completed on those files.

I read with great interest about a CP/M Lisp compiler called
iLISP.  This program is marketed by Computing Insights.  I
wrote to the company for information about iLISP.  For only
$50.00, the features of iLISP sound too good to be true.
Does anyone out there have any 'hands on' experience with
this program???
I will post response summaries to the net.
Thanks in advance for any help given.

I, too, would recommend the Aztec C compiler, but with one reservation:
it generates sub-optimal (ahem) code.  In fact, one might consider its
code generation downright lousy.  (Note:  my version was released over a
year ago.  They have come out with a new release that's supposed to be a
considerable improvement).  On the other hand, it's highly K & R
compatible, produces reasonable error messages, comes with a decent
librarian, and is easy to work with.

I've heard good things about Ecosoft C, too.  An attractive option with
that compiler is that they have a version out that they distribute with
the SLR Systems Assembler/Linker, which has an outstanding reputation.

Subject: MOG-UR dismissal -- doesn't establish a point of law
Message-Id: <8502101252.902.0.VT1.00C@vortex.UUCP>
To: info-cpm@BRL.ARPA, info-micro@BRL.ARPA

It seems unlikely that this represents a test case for anything.
There were a number of factors in this particular case that make
it very specific and unlikely to form any basis of law.

In particular, it involved only one particular message and not
a pattern of messages.  What would happen with BBS's that routinely
allowed the posting of such messages with credit card numbers,
libelous or copyrighted materials, etc.?  I'll give odds that in
that kind of case, there would be sufficient evidence to proceed with
the prosecution.

It should also be noted that another case (more serious than
the MOG-UR case) is already apparently in its early stages.
It supposedly involves a BBS that was set up and used by Neo-Nazis to 
discuss and plan various illegal activities.  The operator of the BBS
has publicly claimed that he doesn't know anything about what
people discuss on his system -- he doesn't care.  Both the U.S.
and Canada are apparently involved with the case.

In other words, I don't think we're looking at any kind of
general ruling from MOG-UR (in fact, I know we're not,
since a prosecution dismissal does not establish any points of law) and
I would expect to see additional actions taken against 
systems--but presumably using more than a single message as evidence.
There was simply not enough evidence in the MOG-UR case for them
to proceed, but there will be other cases.

Thanks Kevin - (all files in MICRO:<CPM.FIDO> on SIMTEL20) - I left
NODELIST squeezed - and changed the "user-side" to FIDOLIST.039 -
because thats the one most "users" will be interested in. I will wait
- till You get all of the pieces - it took Jim Ryan a LONG TIME to get
them up here - (and me two hours to get the stuff from Yuo - plus
"fun" to stuff it onto the -20 from the VAX) -- I just don't have the
time to change every week a major package. I will however switch
"over" when we get another "major" release - and obviously keep the
"node-lists" up to date , whenever they come in.

Hope, this "compromise" ["latest" on DECNET (for DECcies) and on WAYSTAR
for evrybody - MAJOR releases here - and latest NODELIST here too and
also on SIMTEL-20 - will satisfy everybody involved.

Bernie,

Just uploaded NODELIST.0Q9, and FIDOLIST.0Q9.  (Squeezed NODELIST.039
and FIDOLIST.039 - these files are getting too big not to squeeze them for
transfer!)  These files supersede any earlier NODELIST.BBS or NODELIST.nnn
files (old ones should be deleted).   Also, there has been a new FIDO release,
Version 10E is out and available on WayStar and my REFUGE public directory
  REFUGE""::SYS$PUBLIC:[RAINBOW.MSDOS.FIDO]
I have the DEC Rainbow and IBM PC versions on file, others will be put up
as they become available.   V10E is supposedly bugfixes only, no new function.

Regards,

         Kevin R. Porter (Sysop of WayStar at (617)-481-7147 in Marlboro, MA)

Bernie,

  Well,  it took me most of the morning (it's OK, I have two PC's in
my office), but I got you copies of the (rest of) Fido Version  10c.
Some of the improvements in Fido 10c are :

          *  Automatic initialization of most modems
          *  Better routing schedule
          *  Correction of a few minor bugs

The files I sent you are as follows :

          FIDO_IBM.EQE          Fido for the IBM PC, PCjr and clones
          FIDO_OTR.EQE          Fido for the Otrona Attache
          FIDO_SYO.EQE          Fido for the Sanyo 555
          FIDO_TIP.EQE          Fido for the TI Professional

          SYS_IBM.EQE           Sysop utility for IBM, Otrona, Sanyo
          SYS_TIP.EQE           Sysop utility for the TI Professional

For  those  who  are  not  familiar  with this software -- Fido is a
MS-DOS Message and file transfer system that  supports  Kermit  file
transfers  (as  well as Ascii, Xmodem, Modem7, and Telink), multiple
message areas, and national electronic mail.  It was written by  Tom
Jennings,  who  has  placed  it  in  the  public  domain.If you need
assistance with setting up Fido, you can call the following  systems
:

Take it easy.....
                                           Jim Ryan


Bernie,

  Here  (finally)  are  the  copies of Minitel I started to send you
last Friday.  Minitel (Version 3.00) is  a  communications  software
package  written by Tom Jennings (of Fido fame) that supports Kermit
as well as Xmodem, Modem 7 (batch Xmodem) and Telink  (batch  Xmodem
with MS-DOS filesize information).  There are presently six versions
of Minitel :

           IBMMINI.EXE          Minitel for the IBM PC
           DECMINI.EXE          Minitel for the Rainbow 100
           OTRMINI.EXE          Minitel for the Otrona Attache
           SYOMINI.EXE          Minitel for the Sanyo 555
           TIPMINI.EXE          Minitel for the TI Professional
           JRMINI.EXE           Minitel for the IBM PC/Novation

There are also two document files with Minitel :

           MINITEL.DOC          Documentation on Minitel
           MINITEL.PAT          Instructions on patching Minitel

Hope your users find these programs of value.

                                          Jim Ryan

I am looking for a GOOD C compiler for an

to find had a price tag of $450. Any 
information on one you have used and where
I can order it from would be greatly
appriciated.

I would recommend the AZTEC CII compiler by MANX Software Systems.  I have
found it to be a very GOOD implementation of the K+R syntax.  The price
tag for the complete system is ~ $300-350.

This is a question for those who have or have at least used
the Montezuma CP/M (2.2) for the Model 4. How good is the
system overall? What bugs have you found? What "standard"
CP/M programs will not run properly?

 .. from the glowing reviews I have seen in the last year,
you would think it was the best thing since sliced bread.

Also- where is the price the cheapest?

Does anyone have any info on the structure of the data file
that comes with the Random House Thesaurus -- the additive

I'd like to be able to access the thesaurus from some other

	The 10th Annual Trenton Computer Festival is to be held at Trenton
State College, Trenton, NJ, on April 20 and 21 this year.  The exhibit
area is three times larger than last year, and user group meetings, 
demonstrations, and talks on topics ranging from
computer graphics, robotics, operating systems, computer languages, AI,
and others are planned.  A public forum on SYSOPS/Electronic Bulletin
Boards (with some discussion of the MOG-UR case) is also planned.  For
those interested in ZCPR3, I'll be giving a one-hour talk on its status,
future directions, and software development environment philosophies,
which include UNIX and Ada-based and LISP-based workstations.

Subject: Ampro disk performance
To: info-cpm@AMSAA.ARPA
Message-ID: <TYM-ACB-6D0HT@OFFICE-2.ARPA>

My wife uses an Ampro Little Board computer to do her writing and was 
complaining about the poor disk performance.  I applied high powered diagnostic
techniques (an AM radio placed next to the computer) and discovered that the 48
TPI drives were only reading 1 sector per revolution.  Examination of the 
formatter disclosed a format that assumed that every other sector could be read
(skew of 2?).  It would take an extremely optimistic person to believe that you
could read every other 512 byte sector.  The 96 TPI drives use 1024 byte 
sectors and it is possible to read every other sector.  Changing the formatter 
to set the skew at 3 (reading every third sector  1,8,5,2,9,6,3,10,7,4) 
improved the disk performance by a factor of 3!

Further poking around with the multiformatter revealed that many 5 inch formats
actually use 256 byte sectors.  It takes 6 revolutions to read a full track 
with 256 byte sectors and only 2 to read a full track with 1024 byte sectors 
(due to controller and BIOS set up times).  No wonder a lot of people complain 
about 5 inch disks being SLOW!!

One final comment (somewhat unrelated) a recent DDJ article blamed CP/M for 
only having one buffer shared between reading and writing, thus causing a lot 
of prereading (and poor performance) on certain tasks that alternated reading 
and writing single 128 byte records.   BULL....  that is a BIOS fault!  BIOS's 
are implemented by the computer manufacturer and one would think that more of 
them would try harder to get the best performance from their system.  Only a 
little extra code is required to support separate buffers for read and write 
(deblocking buffers).

My Northstar Horizon with 512 byte sectors and separate read and write 
deblocking buffers (my own BIOS) really hums.  I have 8 inch disks as well and 
with 512 byte sectors there is still a 2 to 1 speed difference.  If you compare
8 inch disks to poorliy implemented (AMPRO's bad choice of skew or 256 byte 
sectors) 5 inch BIOS's you might see 6 or even 12 to 1 (256 byte sectors).  My 
heavens!!

With the small (and slow) disk drive space, I would recommend BDS-C

Kaypro has also added a 2 floppy drive, 256K, IBM compatible model at $2295

	I have since been in touch with the Technical Assistance
group at Borland on the above problem.  They told me that anything
beyond the first character is lost when doing a character read from
a logical device <files are still handled as they should be>.  They
are not sure why this is but they are looking into it.  They believe
Turbo is this way because it has character handling capabilities not
present is standard Pascals.  
	For a solution to the problem, they suggested reading the 
input character string into a variable declared as string.  Once the 
string has been entered, it can be parsed and manipulated as needed 
using the string procedures and functions described in section C.5 
of the manual.  So, for now at least, the word is BEWARE when reading
from logical devices - your input is not processed the same as
when reading from files!

	I had the same problem with Turbo on my DEC Rainbow-100 under CPM/86.
	I used the string solution to read the characters in, if fact thats a
lot easier.
	I hound the problem exists with logical devices CON and TERM but seems
to work ok from the KBD device, except you have to do your owm echo of
the input.

Dave,
  One alternative to the character - read problem that I have used (I
use Turbo on an 8 bit Z80 -CP/M system) is the following:
  
  { Function InKey - Returns a keystroke from the keyboard }
  { returns a keyboard character if one is present, else returns ASCII
NUL }

  function InKey: char;
      var  ch: char;
      begin
        if KeyPressed then Read(Kbd,ch) else ch:= chr(0);
        InKey:= ch;
      end;

  Using this procedure, you can get (and process) any keystroke from the
keyboard. You must provide the explicit processing for the character,
ie: you can't use eoln.
  
  This function emulates the BASIC INKEY$ function that is available in
most of the BASICs now in use. It does not echo to the CRT, and if no
key has been pressed, it returns ASCII NUL.
  
  I would use it in your code as follows:

> 	     InChar: char;

I had placed an order for the USRobotics S-100 card modem with S-100
in Phoenix last July or so.  Originally, they were out of stock and
told me that they were expecting another shipment for USR "at the end
of the month".  As time passed, they told me that USR was
"reengineering" the card.  Most recently they informed me via letter
that USR still hadn't resumed shipping that particular product.

Two questions: Does anybody know who if anybody still has this product
in stock?

Does anybody know what the status of this product is wrto USR's
intentions?

While it had some flaws in its original design, the fixes for them
were well known, and it made sense for USR to fix them.  But it almost
looks like they might have just given up on it, which I think would be
sad.  So I would like to know what the product status of this is, and
where the remaining inventory might be.

Subject: WILDEXP version 2.0 for BDS-C now available

WILDEXP.C version 2.0, a BDS C Command-line Wild-card expansion
utility written by Leor Zolman is now available from SIMTEL20:

Filename			Type	 Bytes	 CRC

Directory MICRO:<CPM.BDSC-1>
WILDEX20.CQ.1			BINARY	  5248  0D5DH

What's new for v2.0:
	User area prefixes on wildcards are now permitted;
	'*' or '?' as user number searches ALL user areas (0-15).
	As usual by BDS C convention: if both a drive spec and a
	user area prefix are used with the same file spec, then
	the user area prefix must be first.

General Description:

WILDEXP lets ambiguous file names appear on the command line to C
programs, automatically expanding the parameter list to contain
all files that fit the afn's.

An afn preceded by a "!" causes all names matching the given afn to
be EXCLUDED from the resulting expansion list. Thus, to yield a
command line containing all files except "COM" files, you'd say:

	A>progname !*.com <cr>

(If a single "!" spec is the only parameter on the command line,
then an implicit "*.*" is assumed to have preceded it.)

Another example: to get all files on B: except .C files, say:

	A>prognam b:*.* !b:*.c <cr>

When giving a "!" afn, "*" chars in the string matches to the end of
either the filename or extension, just like CP/M, but "?" chars match
ONE and ONLY ONE character in either the filename or extension.

So far 2 people on the net and myself have purchased the DISCTRON D519
15 Mbyte formatted Hard Disc drives.  The source of these drives had 2
extra drives from his second load and I just picked them up since the
others worked out so well.  Anyone interested in the drives pls contact

          Weinstein -at HI-MULTICS

          Cost $300 + $9.00(postage/ins) + $4.70(manual on bare drive)


PS
          A good source of an IBM comp disc controller is PROTO-PC
          in St. Paul, MN. They are currently selling the Western
          Digital Disc Controller for $199.00. This is the same controller
          that I use that I bought in APril 1984 for $399.00.

are Michael Adlers V2.2 of spell with relocated PATCH adresses.
Location 103 hex holds the marker-byte, location 104 hex holds the
default-disk byte.  Marker byte is NULL for Wordstar users, default
disk is A: as in the original.  For FinalWord usage octal 23 ('#') is
a good marker-byte, for hard-disk owners its advisable to set the
default-disk byte to the hard-disk (I have it set to octal 5 => E:)

SPELL21.LBR is a fully functional set, SPELL21X.LBR contains the
original dictionary in ASCII-form and DICCRE20.*, the tool to hash it
form SPELL usage.  SPELL allows usage of additional "private"
dictionaries and the supplied dictionary is a "happy medium" between
"speed" and "size" - so SPELL21X.LBR should only be needed in very
special cases.

Patching hints are in the included documentation.

Subject:  RMAC patch


I recently installed a patch to RMAC (CP/M-80 vers. 3.0) that was described
in the Application Note # 1 that was widely distributed thru CBBS systems.
The patch is to force RAMC to include local symbols in the symbol table so
that they are available for use under SID. 

This part seems to work fine. The problem is that if I assemble several files
containing the same EQUATE symbols and then try to link them together, I
get "multiple definition" error messages for all those. This is a royal pain
for modular programs using common equate libraries.

Does anyone have a fix for this? Or should I just go back to the untouched
version of RMAC.

Subject:  Screwed-up mail delivery at AMSAA and BRL hosts.

Keith - Following nearly simultaneous changes to the operating systems of
ALL local hosts AND the mail delivery software as well, mail delivery here
has been in a somewhat chaotic state.  Large queues have been building,
which appear to have then been ignored.  I ride to work with one of the "mail
people", and he has told of having to manually unstick the queues on several
occasions.  I suggest that you resend your message about the demise of ITS
binary files in the archives if you feel there is the slightest chance that
the original was not fully delivered.  This is too significant a change not
to get full distribution.  If local mail problems continue, please send all
future complaints to our Postmaster, Doug Kingston <dpk@brl-tgr>, who is the
only person who can really fix things (since the mail is pretty much his
baby).  But be warned: BRL-TGR has been having serious disk problems for
several days, and mail to that host might "get lost".  Life in computerland
is not dull.

The February issue of BYTE magazine contains an article on the accuracy
of floating-point operations.  Included in the article is a program to
display some of the features of the floating-point implementation of a
compiler.  The program is called GUARD.  It is actually an excerpt from
a larger program called PARANOIA.  Below is a list of the results of
GUARD for several popular compilers/interpreter.

Please refer to the BYTE article "PARANOIA: A FLOATING-POINT BENCHMARK"
for a complete explaination of the terms.  If anyone has the complete
PARANOIA program, I am interested in getting a copy.

I am having a problem with the mcat series of  programs.  I  have
both  mcat.lbr  from  SIMTEL and cat86-1.lbr from DEC-MARLBORO. I
have created the appropriate .cmd files, and the  mast.cat  file,
with  no  problem,  even when I have more than 256 file names. (I
have used the instructions in MAST.SET to fix mcat.cmd to  accept
the  larger  number  of files.) However, both xcat programs, from
the two libraries, boggle at more than 256 filenames, and  return
a message of

         1 File Names
         1 Unique Names

and put nothing else into mast.lst. How do I setup xcat to accept
the larger file sets?

For the record I am using a DEC Rainbow 100A with 800K+  RAM,  so
there can be no problem with available space in RAM.

	After spending a frustrating couple of hours trying to unpack
the spelling library with NULU, I "accidentally" found that my
troubles were with NULU (10 and 11).  Large files, particularly the
source dictionary SPELL.DQT, do >not< get unsqueezed properly by NULU.
Good ol' LU did OK, though.  At least I think so -- I am comparing the
CP/M results with what I get by using the TOPS20 DE-LBR and USQ
utilities. I used NSWEEP to un-squeeze on the micro, and this seems to
be OK, too.

	The upshot is that I am now very suspicious of NULU, esp.  for
largish files.  If anyone is in contact with the NULU author, Martin
Murray, you might want to pass on this message to him, with a copy of
the failing library SPELL21X.LBR.  I really do like NULU, but,
sigh,.....

To anyone that can help;

     I have tried to install NULU11 on my Northstar Horizon system 
that includes a Televideo 950 terminal.  The basic NULU11.COM file 
seems to work as expected.  But I have discovered some problems.  

1)   I can't get NULU11 to activate an installed option command line 
     when I have installed the NULUTERM.ASM and the NULU11F1.ASM 
     files.  

2)   If I create the same library that I have just deleted - on the 
     same empty disk, NULU11 just reopens the old deleted library.  
     However the entire file has not been activated.  It is only 
     minimum (2k) block size.  When I try to add a file then the 
     entire old library is restored.

3)   NULU11 will not open an old file that I have created with NULU10.

4)   I can't get NULU11 to open a library from the command line at 
     invocation if the NULUTERM and NULU11F1 files are installed.

COMAL LANGUAGE INTERPRETER

Comal  is the result of a marriage between Pascal and Basic, and combines  the
best  of these two worlds. It has the simple and highly interactive  operating
environment  that is characteristic of Basic. The programming language  itself
is  in  the same tradition as Algol, Pascal, Ada and other  modern  structured
programming languages.

Mytech  Comal  fulfills  the  Comal 2.00 requirements. Apart  from  the  usual
program  structures  from  Pascal and other languages, like  if,  for,  while,
repeat,  case,  function  and procedure statements, it also has  an  exception
handling  mechanism  similar to what can be found in Ada. The package  concept
makes it possible to use machine language coded routines within Comal, thereby
in  effect extending the language with new keywords. An example of this is the
Turtle graphics package (c.f. LOGO).

In  addition,  Mytech  Comal  has several interesting  enhancements.  We  have
strived  to  make the language as orthogonal as possible. It is  for  instance
possible  to treat array values just as other values, and which can be  passed
as value arguments to functions, can be returned as values from functions etc.
As  another  example,  the  operating environment enables  you  to  trace  the
execution  of  the  program and the intermediate values  computed  during  the
execution.

Mytech  Comal  is  available for the IBM PC family including PC-AT  under  the
operating  systems C-CPM/86, MS-DOS and PC-DOS, and supports the 8087 floating
point  processor.  It  also  runs on several UNIX  systems,  like  VAX,  WICAT
(68000-based),  and a NS32000 system. The software has been written in C,  and
it is therefore a relatively simple task to port it to other systems.

Comal has attracted much interest in Europe in recent years, particularly with
educational  institutions.  In  Denmark  and Sweden  it  has  been  officially
approved  for  use  in  teaching  programming  to  high-school  students.  Its
structure  together  with  its user-friendly interface makes  it  the  perfect
programming  language  both for educational purposes and for the  professional
programmer.

MicroSoft Basic on 8080/z80 allows only value of 1-32767 on
the random record number.  I am using BASCOM compiler right now
and I suspect it will be possible to increase the record number
by hacking BRUN.COM, the runtime module. Did any one knows how
to do it ?

Thanks

Aztec is a reasonable compiler, but if you're just getting started
with C, I would recommend something like the C-80 package from Software
Toolworks.  It sells for $50 (at least, that's what I paid) and generates
good code and is a fairly complete C subset.  It would be hard to beat
for the price.

Another excellent package (great to work with, because it's so fast)
is BDS C, which sells for $150.

I have both the ECO-SOFT C and BDS C for CPM-80.  ECO-SOFT is a
fairly good K&R implementation, but the code it produces and/or its
run-time library are VERY BAD.  

BDS C is a subset, with some moderately annoying restrictions.
However, simple programs in BDS-C seem to be 30% smaller and 30%
faster than the same programs in ECO-SOFT C.  I have found this
to be a sufficiently large difference that I rarely use ECO-SOFT
C (though I keep it around for portability).

Also, BDS C provides a source-level debugger; I know of no other
C for CPM-80 which does.

In other words, I haven't found a satisfactory C for my home system
yet, I have to use two unsatisfactory ones.

<wonder if the line eater also ate the Rainbow>

As I was half listening during the CBS Morining News (2/13/85),
amid the finanicial news they had a one-liner about DEC having 
dropped the Rainbow pc line.  Anybody know what's going on? Last 
thing I had heard was that DEC had big plans for the Rainbow for 
Vax workstations and stuff like that.

  I think you have this reversed, NULU version 1.0 does not put CRC's in the
library directory whereas LU does, this causes LU to indicate a CRC error
when using files created by NULU. NULU Version 1.1 uses CRCs and thus is 
totally compatible with LU. NULU can also be patched to know about your screen
and that makes the output very nice.

I can see how this one would slip by most people. I for one rarely specify
an output file because I want the output to have the same name as it has
when it is in the library. I could see though that if you were doing a 
simultaneous extract (or unsqueeze-extract) and rename by using the
=DU:Filename.Typ it would be a problem. There is one patch file out that
fixes a couple of other bugs in 1.1 call NULU11F1.ASM. I don't know
if it fixes these two above or not.

I sent David a note asking about a recent message saying that Version
1.4 was the latest XLISP.  I was wondering if that was true or not.
From his reply it looks like Version 1.2 will be the last version
that can run on an 8-bit system.

Re:   [winkler: XLISP version 1.4]

The information that Dan Winkler has distributed is correct.  The
newest version of XLISP is version 1.4.  Unfortunately, it is really
too big to fit on CP/M-80 systems any more.  It does work fine under
CP/M-86 and CP/M-68K though.

According to the most recent Computerworld, DEC has dropped production 
of the Rainbow.  The article stated that DEC has a large number of them 
in stock, and will try to run the stock out.  The article also stated
that while the production run of Rainbows has stopped, it could always 
be restarted.

I just downloaded the Public Domain Linking Assembler, LASM.COM, from an
RCPM. Unfortunately, it did not have the .DOC file with it. Could someone
out in net-land send me a copy? I don't think it's too big for the net..
I would prefer to get it from USENET rather than ARPA since I cannot send
to the ARPA net without cost. Thank you.

This can be done with "dd", for example:

% dd if=/dev/floppy of=foo bs=128 count=2002  # read CP/M disk into file "foo"
% dd of=/dev/floppy if=foo bs=128 count=2002  # write CP/M disk from file "foo"

Berkeley supplies a program called "cpm" that allows you to manipulate
a CP/M diskette image file. Look for the sources in /usr/src/new/cpm.
The documentation is in volume 2C of the Berkeley manuals.

Apparently my message concerning the complete changeover from
ITS-binary to BINARY (8) on SIMTEL20 was lost by some mailers.  There
was a mail problem at BRL about that same time.

ALL binary files at SIMTEL20 are now 8-bit BINARY.  There are no
ITS-binary files remaining.  The only change to the FTP user will be
to NOT strip the first four bytes from the head of binary files.

" What is the proper configuration for hooking up an MOV to a power
  line?  (i.e.  in series or in parallel?).

							  Joe "
--------

The MOV is a shunt device: it has a high impedance until a transient
causes a large voltage to appear across it, at which point its
resistance becomes small, or more precisely, it prevents the voltage
from getting much bigger by shunting a large current through the MOV.

To protect equipment with MOVs connected to the AC line, you would
want to choose an MOV rated for a voltage which would not NORMALLY
appear across the line.  Be sure to find out (does anybody know?)
whether the MOV is rated in terms of instantaneous peak voltage or RMS
line voltage.  The peak voltage is sqrt(2) times the RMS value of 115
or 120, thus about 170 volts.  To allow for manufacturing tolerances,
an MOV which limits peaks to about 190 or 200 volts would probably be
about right.

Another parameter you need to choose is the maximum shunt current you
need to handle in the MOV.  The right choice depends on the
application.  For EMP protection, FEMA recommends a rule of thumb of
25 to 120 Amps per FOOT of exposed conductor if the conductor is
vertical and 5 to 10 Amps per foot if it is horizontal.  In either
case, a practical limit would occur at about 2000 Amps because more
than that will arc over around even your MOV.  So probably a 2000 Amp
peak current rating would handle most transients in the real world.
I'm not sure just how LIGHTNING transients would differ from EMP, but
it is generally claimed that the risetime is longer (slower) for
lightning.  I suspect that the above rules of thumb for EMP would
result in a conservative design that would handle lightning nicely
also.

The MOV would be connected across the line (in parallel, in your
terms).  A single MOV at the power entrance point would be very useful
if all wiring beyond that point is in metal conduit.  However, note
that MOVs may become ineffective after being zapped a couple of times,
so it might be well to install several of them in parallel at the
entrance point.  It is also a good idea to inspect or test them
periodically.

Bear in mind that both EMP and lightning are fairly wideband
phenomena, EMP particularly extending well into the VHF region.
Because they are so wideband, they act like (they in fact ARE) radio
waves and can get picked up by even a few FEET of conductor betwee the
"central" MOV and the device in question.  MOVs at various other
points in the system would provide better protection to specific
(expensive) equipment especially if the entrance-point MOV(s) failed
or if the distribution wiring in the building is not shielded.

The LEAD LENGTH and inductance in series with the MOV will greatly
reduce its effectiveness in limiting voltage peaks.  It is best to use
techniques similar to those used in building VHF/UHF amplifiers: very
short leads, wide "straps" rather than ordinary wire, or else large
diameter conductor, avoid bending the conductor (because bends
introduce inductance) etc.

Additional protection can be provided more locally by using Zener
diodes on low-voltage lines and gas gap devices on antenna feedlines.
NOTE THAT AIR GAPS ARE NOT EFFECTIVE against EMP transients because
the risetime is much faster than the time required to ionize air.  Buy
a gas discharge device specifically designed for EMP or lightning
protection, and then check it periodically (after every major
electrical storm, for example).

I hope the above is helpful.  Please note that I am only an "instant"
expert on this subject rather than a "real" expert, so I may not be
able to give you much more detail than the above.  However, I would be
glad to try to answer any further questions or point you at someone
who can do so.

I don't have a program for you, but I do have a possible fix.  I use
MODEM7 with the normal intercept character - even though I use EMACS
here on SIMTEL20.  The trick is to look in your overlay for the option
which defines whether the intercept character preceeds a local or a
remote character.  Reverse it.  You then type the intercept character
ONLY before a local command.  This allows you to use all the control
characters with EMACS.  Type the intercept character twice to send it
out over the modem.

    Keith - I just saw the note on <CPM.SPELL>SPELL21X.LBR, and
    decided to grab a copy.  In doing so, I discovered that an ITS
    header is present on this file (didn't try SPELL21.LBR).  Our
    auto-ftp programs here at BRL check for the ITS header, and strip
    it if present.  The results of this test and strip action are
    reported to the user.  For other files I have FTPed since you
    removed the ITS headers, the program has indeed indicated that
    the header was not present.

You are right.  Sorry about that.  SPELL21X.LBR has been corrected, is
now BINARY instead of ITS-binary.

everything powered to correct voltages. (You would spazz to if you
were only getting 4.50 volts across your pins... I'm using a big power
supply borrowed from work in the interim)

Does anyone know of someone who is manufacturing hefty power supplies
that will fit in the case of the machine? Or for that matter, does anyone
have a list of third party Osborne 1 after-market addons?

Tanks do advance and please cc: replies to me please - I'm not on
info-cpm...

I've got a Z80 CP/M system with two 5.25 in drives. A: is ss/dd,
B: is ds/dd.  I keep getting the error message 

Bdos error on B:R/O

when trying to delete files, or copying using PIP, and with Wordstar.
The canonical situation is having a write-protect tab on the disk: I
don't.  Does anyone have any idea what might be wrong?  Whatever it
is, it's intermittent.  Any pointers as to where the problem may lie
would be appreciated.

	Some CPM systems will assign a dick drive a R/O when the drive door is

case,  enter CTRL-C after changing disks.

Actually one MOV would not work at all. You would need three,

MOV from :
	Hot to Neutral
	Neutral to Ground
	Ground to Hot

This protects the circuit from transients on any or any two of the
three legs of the feed. The real trouble is that the entire load of a
house can tax the MOVs unless you get the more expensive rated MOVs,
and besides most of the devices in the house are insensitive to
transients.

Second, the MOVs on the feed box would protect sensitive equipment
from the outside transients, but would not filter out the transients
that originate within a house. Yes the MOVs would trip and suppress
the transient, but also the power suppies of TV's, computers, etc
would also see the transient since they are on the short side of the
transient, so these devices would not have adequate protection.

The best advice is to install the MOVs as close to sensitive equipment
as possible and if you put MOVs in a outlet box, only plug in
compatible equipment into that box so that you can reduce possibility
of transients defeating the MOVs.

In my parents house, every spring the thundershowers knock out the
rectifiers in the TV. after two years and progressing through voltage
ratings up to the highest (~4Kv), I installed MOVs across the line AND
across the transformer output AND across the rectifier AND across the
output side of the logic supply. (Not across the tube supply of
course!) The cost was only about 15$, but after having the rectifier
replaced twice, and an entire main board replaced because the
transient took out most if not ALL of the IC's, I think the overkill
will save the boards. And for the last four years, there has not been
a single problem due to transients in the TV. (But transients did blow
the radio that was plugged into the SAME outlet).

This is why it is recommended that MOVs be placed in EACH item that
you wish to protect.

20$ of MOVs are worth more than the agrevation of blowing delicate
electrical equipment.

Most MOVs are designated both by peak current and NOMINAL voltage
These devices work for both AC and DC. (AC devices will last longer
though).

If you hooked up MOVs at the feed box for the house, it would protect
from the outside disturbances, but not inside transients.

If you want to protect logic, I recommend tranzorb devices by GS
(general semiconductor), specifically the

	1N5908

This devices charecteristics are:

	1.5Kw Peak Pulse Power dissipation @ 25 deg c
	Tclamp (0 V to BVmin) < 1 pecoseconds! (theoretical)
		(can not measure it if < 3 picoseconds)
	Forward Surge rating (1/2 cycle):
		200amps, 1/120 second @ 25 deg c
	Steady State power dissipation:
		5W @ 75 deg c, lead length 3/8 inch
	Repitition rate (duty cycle):
		.05%

It comes in a molded case, (9.4mm X 5.08mm)

Clamping voltage is 7.2 volts, and rises only slightly to ~ 8 volts @
100v and rises slightly beyond. This is unlike MOVs that may rise to
quite higher than the nominal voltage indicated.

10Kpf capacitance, reducable to 200pf by schottky diode in series, 1KA
@ 7.2 V

This is only one of the devices GS makes, and this is intended for
logic protection. Originally designed for MIL work to protect from
nuke EMP, these devices work quite well.

for more info, write GS for a catalog:

	General Semiconductor Industries, Inc.
	2001 West Tenth Place
	Tempe, Arizona 85281
	(602) 968-3101

This is not an endorsment of mine, however, a friend does endorse
them.

In-reply-to: Msg of 22 Feb 1985  08:06-MST from Walt Livingston <DSDC-SDT2 at GUNTER-ADAM.ARPA>

    Can someone tell me, or show me where to look, for the meanings of such
    file extensions as *.AQM, *.DQC, *.MQC, *.FQX, *.IQF, *.TQT, *.HQP,
    *.OQT, *.FQB, *.LQT, and *.DQR.  All of these file extensions show up
    on binary files.  Is there a standard that these follow??

On files in the MICRO:<CPM.x> directory on SIMTEL20 the "Q" results
when SQ (the Hoffman file squeezer) has been used on the file.  Just
imagine what the missing letter is and you'll have a good idea what
the file is.  You'll need USQ (the unsqueezer) to restore them to the
original form before they can be read.

DQC=DOC, MQC=MAC, FQX=FIX, IQF=INF, TQT=TXT, HQP=HLP, LQT=LST, DQR=DIR.

The OQT and FQB are special cases.  Those resulted when .OCT and .FEB
(the month of the newsletter in question) were squeezed.

    I own a S-100 based micro with boards from Lomas Data Products. Does
anyone else out in netland have a similiar machine. If so, I would like to
discuss various upgrade options with them. For those unfamiliar with LDP,
they are a competitor of Compupro. They sell S-100 boards and systems such
as 10Mhz 8086 boards, 80286 boards, 3Mb dynamic ram boards etc and they
support CPM/86, MSDOS 2.1 and Concurrent PC-DOS (hopefully UNIX soon).

   Recently, they came out with a 3 Mb dynamic ram board which works with a 
10Mhz 8086 with no wait states. More interestingly, they have a S-100 board
which emulates the video display of an IBM PC. It seems to be quite
compatible to the point where they have an IBM PC keyboard interface on the
display board. According to Rich Lomas, they have developed a version of
MS-DOS 2.1 which runs PC-DOS programs. Amongst the ones they tried are
dBaseII and Lotus 1-2-3 with graphics. Does any one know if Compupro came
out with theirs and how compatible it is.

   I have had my system for 2 years and have been quite satisfied with their
support. Upgrading this system is cheap - a 10Mb hard disk with controller
and PS was only $900. Now for $500, I can get PC compatibility (I have 2 8"
and 1 5 1/4" drive) through the graphics board (and retire my faithful 5
year old H-19). I have quite a lot of public domain stuff configured for my
system and will be willing to share it.

I have no connection with LDP other than being a customer.

I apologize if the following bug has already been discussed, but I
don't remember seeing it, so:

Earlier this evening I used "sq" and "lar" under UNIX to create a .LBR
full of SQueezed files, and then shipped it to my CP/M system.  When I
then used "-q *.*" in NULU 1.1 to extract and unsqueeze all of the
files, I was left with a directory full of lower-case file names!

One could perhaps argue that the UNIX version of SQ shouldn't store the
file names in lower case, but I disagree, since they might be destined
for another UNIX system.  In any case, I think NULU should put all file
names in canonical form before using them under CP/M.

To use MOVs, you need three of them.  Inside your outlet box, connect
one from green to white, one from black to white, and one from black
to green.  There is good reason why a single set of MOVs won't protect
a whole house - wires don't have zero resistance to DC, and their
impedance to AC is often rather surprising.  Spikes at one point in
the house may or may not exist elsewhere.

Cheers,

	I have a DEC Rainbow 100+, which uses the DEC Multi-national
character set (an 8-bit character set).  I downloaded the NULU11 library,
and it works fine, except for one problem.  When I View the NULU documentation,
it is fine.  But when I use NULU to unsqueeze it, it is full of 8-bit
characters (which makes it almost impossible to read).  This is also true
for the note file and others in the NULU library.

	I used NULU to create a library of documents for my system.  The
library is called DOCUMENT.LBR.  But whenever I enter NULU and give it the
library, it prints the library name and has 8-bit characters for the file
type.  So it comes out DOCUMENT.xBx, where the x's are 8-bit character in
the DEC multi-national character set.

	Just thought I had better pass along this bug to be added to the

Keith,
In all of this flurry about the NULU11 unsqueeze function, the users
must be sure that they have applied the NULU!!11F1.AQM patch to the original
program.  It fixes some problems with filenames in the unsqueeze function,
plus several others.

In that context, last tweek there was a complaint that NULU11 could not 
successfully unsqueeze the large dictionary file from the new SPELL21X
library.  I tried it here (H89, Heath CP/M) and had no problems at all.

I did, however, pass the bug reports on tho the NULU author, which I will
continue to do with whatever appears on the net.

Regards,
Steve Noland

i just got hold of a xebec s1410 controler(the stand alone SASI model) and
i sa604 hard disk. i am intertaining ideas of force fitting the setup into
my vt180. what i am looking for is examples of bios code to talk to the xebec
controler, or sources for same (i'll pay some dollars but would rather not).
any info would be appreciated. if there is any response , i'll summarize.

Steve:

I had already applied NULU11F1.AQM (the signon message date now reads
02/03/05), so that's not the problem.  I appreciate the suggestion,
though.

My thanks also to all of the kind people who told me of ways to rename
the lower-case-named files.  I should have mentioned in my original
message that I immediately renamed them with NSWP (kudos to Dave Rand).

I'm not presently a Lomas customer, but am quite interested in their
recent announcements. Do you run their CCPM? Is it version 3.1? Does
it offer PCMODE?
I also wonder if the IBM graphics board is a real product, or does it
only exist in the shop? I was hoping that there would be some
alternatives to Dr. Bill's non-existent hardware and kludgey software,
but I have not seen anything to give encouragement that Lomas is the
answer to our prayers, just more hype.

According to the editor of Car and Driver - a rare beast among Z-D
magazines: they make a profit - what is really going on here is that
Ziff-Davis itself is going under.  They have sold a number of
magazines, C/D included, to CBS, and are in the process of
selling/closing nearly everything else.  So if you want a refund from
a defunct magazine, I suggest you move quickly.

More info on this is included in editor David E. Davis's Driver's Seat
column, February 1985 issue of Car and Driver.

Thanks to all who've responded so far.  I wasn't very clear in stating
the original problem.  I get the above error message *when I haven't  
changed the disk in drive B*.  Sometimes I've just completed a PIP and
I know there is lots of space left on the disk.  My suspicion is that 
the write protect switch is acting up because if I stick my finger in the 
drive slot and jiggle the switch, the problem *sometimes* goes away.
And sometimes it doesn't.  An alternative that occasionally works is
to push the disk in and out of the drive a few times.

I've had this happen earlier today, and had to shut the system down
because I couldn't write to drive B, even after ^C'ing many times
and rebooting (and cursing and yelling....).  

Is this a hardware problem or something in the bdos/bios (I think I've
got the sources).

Thanks again,

The BDOS function code for "getting" and "setting" the user area is 20h.
The contents of register E determines whether to get or set.  If register
E contains FFh, then the curent user area is returned in register A.
Any other valid user number in register E will set you to that user.
i.e.

------------
 
The BDOS function code for "getting" and "setting" the user area is 20h.
Perhaps you are not distinguishing hex from decimal or vice-versa (20h = 32d).
Anyways, the contents of register E determines whether to get or set the user
area.  If register E contains FFh, then the curent user area is returned in
register A.  Any other valid user number in register E will set you to that
user number.  i.e.
 
procedure change_users;
   const
      user_code = $0020;   { BDOS call }
      current = $FF;
   var
      new_user : byte;
   begin
      writeln('Current user is: ',bdos(user_code,current));
      write('New user? ');
      readln(new_user);
      bdos(user_code,new_user);   { put new_user in register E to change }
   end;

those types of programs.  The Kaypro uses a serial port rather than a 
parallel port to connect the keyboard.  What needs to be done to change
the way the keyboard is decoded before it goes to the computer?  Would
it be a matter of a neew ROM somewhere?  Can you buy  a serial Dvorak

A shift key mod for the ][+??  All it takes is a wire; there's no big deal
about that really.  Mine consists of one wire with alligator clips on either
end, and one small wire coming out of the game I/O port.  Simply take a
thin short wire, stick it in the game I/O socket (I meant socket not port,
whatever...) at pin 4, and attach one end of the alligator clipped wire to
this short wire that's in pin 4 of game I/O, and the other end to the
keyboard encoder board.  You'll notice that you have under the keyboard
a pile of half-inch pins all lined up.  You'll want the one that's 2nd from
the right (at a bird's eye view of the apple, assuming that the bird is
aloft (1)).  This is where you put the other end of the alligator clipped
wire.  THEN of course, you need the lowercase chip or card or whatever.
(I use a Viewmax-80 card).

Recently a file called NULU12.OBJ appeared on a local system in L.A.  This
fill appears to NOT be a real update to NULU11, but just a renamed NULU11
with the fix file added.  Date appearing in header is 3 Feb 85, along with
NULU 1.2.  That is the same date as in the "fixed" NULU11.  Please watch

Re: protecting your house from lightning carried on the incoming power
lines.

1) Most homes around here have 3 line, single phase 120/240 service.
All three lines should be protected- taking 3 MOVs or ONE three-
electrode gas tube.  When the gas tube is fired (due to voltage on
any pair of lines) it "shorts" all three lines together.

2) At the entrance to the house wiring the power lines can indeed
supply lots of power and so the protection device must be able to pass
lots of current and dissipate lots of power.  Once again a gas tube
fits the description.

  A company I've dealt with (through a distributor) which makes a
variety of gas tube surge protectors is TII (I don't remember what it
stands for, and I can't find my catalog.)  An example of a home
lightening surge protector (from a 6 year old spec sheet): Three wire,
maximum discharge voltage: 450V@500AMP, 800V@1,000AMP 2 1/2" x 2 1/2"
x 1 3/8" + 1/2" threaded nipple $21.54.

I am looking for modem/terminal software for an S-100 CP/M system running
a Z80 system with a CCS 2810 CPU and 2719 I/O board.  I am looking to see
if I can down load files from a CP/M system to a Commodore 64 in order to
save these files on the Commodore disk drive.  It need not be complex,
since I only need the software to down load at the moment.  If anyonh has any
modem hardware (schematics, etc) that would be helpful, too.

I am confused as how to ftp a file from SIMTEL20 to MIT-MC and then
download it to my machine and get the checksum to agree.

For example: In the <cpm.filutl> dir there is a file FINDU10.COM.
The checksum shown for this file in the CRCLST of 010585 was
25F1H and it was labelled to be a COM file.  The CRCLST of
021185 labelled it as a BINARY file, with the same checksum of
25F1H.  When I FTP this file to MIT-MC the checksum, as shown by the :CRC utility on MC is 82D3H and it
is indicated to be "ASCII TEXT".

When I download this file using :MMODEM SB I get still another checksum
when I check the received file using CRCK.  I get 542AH.

Can someone tell me what I'm doing wrong?

	Here is how to do a shift mod. on your apple II (not //e). A
recent message on info-apple covered some of it.

	You will have to connect a wire from the shift key to pin 4 on
the game port. It's the fourth pin from the front on the left side,
looking at it from the keyboard end. One of my ancient tomes (the
Superscribe II manual) saya to use a 13in. length of #22 wire, and
strip 1/4" from both ends. This is a bit too detailed, but who cares.
Ho
	How you connect the other end depends on your computer. If
your apple is revision 6 or 7, it has an extra circuit board attached
between the keyboard and the motherboard. If it is revsion 5 or below,
it doesn't.

	For 6 or 7, connect the other end to the second pin from the
right on the 50-pin connector. (right under the asterisk key) The
connector is on the right half of the board. This is the shift pin.

	If it's revision 5 or below, you have to remove the case by
unscrewing the screws on the bottom (all 10 screws). Then solder the
wire to tyhe shift pin pon the keyboard encoder. 

	You can now use the shift key by reading the input from
paddle button 2 (this is where you connected the wire). It works: I'm
using it now with Ascii Express and as Videx Videoterm 80 col. card.

	This seems as if it will work better. Does anyone have more

info-cpm,
	Can anyone tell me how to port squeezed and library files
from simtel20 to a unix system?  I have been unable to transfer
anything successfully since the change in the squeezer format.
Thank you for any assistance.
	Since the changes in the squeeze format of files archived
on simtel20.  Specifically after transferring a .lbr file to a
unix system, I use itstonorm.c and lar.c from micro:<unix.cpm>
on it.  If I simply use lar.c, it tells me that the library has
no entries, none used, and none unused.  If I run itstonorm on it and
then run lar.c on it, I am informed that it is not a library.  I
have tried to read the ludef5.dqc files but likewise I cannot get
xusq107.c from micro:<unix.cpm> to work.  It informs me that the
decode tree is invalid.

Does anyone out there, have, in any language (high level), for any
computer, a program which will do simple two dimensional curves on a
Diablo printer.  I type lots of lab reports and am tired of plotting
curves by hand. I have seen that Diablos can do simple graphics,
that's all I want.  The ability to read in say four sets of X,Y data
points into the same graph would be nice.  Any help in the area would
be most appreciated.  BitGraphics and Character Graphics programs are
both quite acceptable.

Subject: MLOAD24 - a enhanced replacement for LOAD

MLOAD, Ron Fowler's enhanced replacement for CP/M-80's LOAD.COM has
been updated to version 2.4 and is now available from SIMTEL20:

Filename			Type	 Bytes	 CRC

Directory MICRO:<CPM.ASMUTL>
MLOAD24.AQM.1			BINARY	 24064  585AH

MLOAD is a replacement for the cp/m "LOAD" program: this program fixes
many of the problems associated with the "CP/M" load program, and adds
many new features.

MLOAD has the ability to pre-load a non-hex file, allowing mload to be
used to load hex file patches (obviating any need to use DDT).  The
first (and only the first) filespec (after the "=", if used) may be
non-hex; the filetype must be specified.

	Examples:
		1)	mload ws.com,wspatch
		2)	mload MEXTEST=MEX112.COM,MXO-US13
		3)	mload ws.ovr,ovrpatch

The first example loads WS.COM, overlays it with wspatch.hex, and
writes the output to WS.COM.  The second example loads MEX112.COM,
overlays it with MXO-US13.HEX, and writes the output file to
MEXTEST.COM.  (note that the second example is the recommended
technique, since it preserves the original file). The third example
loads WS.OVR and patches it with the file "OVRPATCH.HEX".

ZCPR2-style du specs are fully supported, for both input and output
files.  Thus, the following command lines are permissable:

	b3>mload a4:myfile.com=0:bigfil,b6:patch1,c9:patch2
	a6>mload b5:=c3:mdm717.com,mdmpatch

After loading, an information line is printed in the statistics
report, which displays the true size of the saved image.

This program is a replacement for the cp/m "LOAD" program.  Why
replace "LOAD"?  well... LOAD.COM has a few deficiencies.  For
example, if your hex file's origin is above 100h, LOAD.COM prepends
blank space to the output file to insure it will work as a CP/M
transient.  It cares not if the file is not intended as a CP/M
transient.  It also doesn't like hex records with mixed load addresses
(for example, one that loads below a previous record -- which is a
perfectly legitimate happenstance).  Also, LOAD.COM can load only one
program at a time, and has no provision for a load bias in the command
specification. Finally, there is no provision for user specification
of the output file name.

Well, there are dozens, but few that can be accessed without some local
cooperation.  In addition, much of the action during the last few years
has been in getting this kind of data in a form so that it can be
distributed on diskettes, with accessing software, for Apple-sized
machines.  A directory of many of those databases, and whether/how they
are accessible from the outside, has been produced annually for the last
few years by Dr.  Loretta Hoover at the University of Missouri at
Columbus.  You may want to reach them and get a copy of the directory
(if you have problems tracking down an address or number, send me mail
and I will send it to you when I next go into the office).

Most of the data available in this country is derived from USDA data
(mostly the so-called Handbook 8) and from data prepared by the FDA.
While those data are public, neither of those organizations have chosen
to make them available via networks (although some of them are available
in machine-readable form).  Most of the databases listed by Hoover are
USDA data, plus some local analyses (of varying quality), plus software;
their vendors are essentially acting as value-added retailers of the
public data.

You should be especially careful where trace nutrients are concerned.
In addition to being analytically tricky, the values of several of them
seem to depend heavily on local growing or feeding conditions, so the
ranges associated with the values (rarely contained in the available
tables) can be astronomical.

We have a project running (under the name "INFOODS") with the charge of
trying to bring some sense out of this madness and of making sure that,
a few years down the line, there are clear "yes" answers to inquiries
like yours from anywhere in the world.  If you can give me a surface
mail address and some information about your background and interests in
this type of information, and are interested, I will get you onto the
newsletter mailing list.

Subject: uucp information?

A friend is writing a Public-Domain MSDOS uucp implementation.  He
needs information on the protocol used by uucio, and on
RS-something-or-another headers.

He says there was something very recently on one of the mailing lists
on where to get various on-line papers, and these were mentioned
there.  Does anyone have a copy of these messages?

Any pointers to information, papers, public-domain implementations or
half-implementation, people, etc. would be appreciated.

Subject: XMODEM version 105 now available from SIMTEL20

Thanks to Steve Noland <NOLAND at USC-ISI.ARPA>, we now have XMDM105,
the latest version of XMODEM.  XMODEM is primarily of interest to
Remote CP/M system operators.  It allows unattended uploads and
downloads using the enhanced Christensen "MODEM" protocol (compatible
with MODEM7) using either CRC or CHECKSUM modes.  The file is
available via ANONYMOUS ftp from SIMTEL20 as:

Filename			Type	 Bytes	 CRC

Directory MICRO:<CPM.RCPM>
XMDM105.LBR.1			BINARY	 97408  6628H

Here are the CRCs for the library's internal files:

	File		Bytes		CRC

	READ.ME		3669		4A89
	WHAFOR.COM	1536		4C8C
	WHANEW.COM	1536		199A
	WHATSFOR.COM	1280		6240
	XMDEL.COM	1152		E3B7
	XMDM105.AQM	78208		E409
	XMDM105.DQC	5376		7004
	XMDM105.IQF	4224		C889

Here is what's new in recent versions:

XMDM105: Now accepts XMODEM R 6:HELLO.DOC.  It also accepts ZCPR
convention, using the current drive if none is mentioned.  Date
routine added for CP/M+ users.  As .PRL files are handled like .COM
files by CP/M+ systems, those are changed now to .OBJ files when using
the CPMPLUS equate.  Several useful auxiliary programs added such as
WHAFOR, WHATNEW, XMDEL, etc., for the SYSOP's use.

XMDM104 NEW CHANGES: Asks for a description of a non-private upload.
Creates and maintains a WHATSFOR.TXT file in A14: area.  A companion
program called WHATSFOR.COM would be placed in A0: to display the
contents of the description file, offering full security.  Most recent
descriptions will be shown first.  (A safety feature times out in
about two minutes if no description is typed.  This prevents permanent
hangups.)

XMDM103: When the WHEEL byte is set, XMDM103 allows SYSOPs to upload
files to any drive or user area in a normal manner.  Previous versions
required the SYSOP to use the same location (usually B0:) available
for remote user.

Configuration option CPMPLUS is provided to allow the TIMEON feature
to operate in a CP/M Plus environment.  The code includes page zero
definition changes as well as additions to the GETTIME subroutine.
Other recent changes listed early in XMDM103.ASM.

Friend,

Re your wanting modem/terminal software for a CP/M system to download to
a Commodore 64...

If you want to do this Thing back-to-back (e.g., not over a telephone), you
could do it through a straight RS-232 connection! PIP will do an XON/XOFF
transfer (>PIP LST:=FOOBAR.TXT[B]).  They sell RS-232 converters for
the C64 via mail order for about $39, and the latest Byte (I think) had
a simple board for that .

If you truly need modem software, get back with me and I'll point you
to MODEM7xx.

Since it is pretty widely known that I have my own versions of
UUCP that are unrelated to AT&T code, I thought I'd comment
on this general topic now to head off the direct mail that usually
gets sent to me after such queries.

---

It is important to realize that UUCP isn't really a protocol, it
is an EFFECT.  It is a bunch of different programs that happen
to know how to speak to each other.  There is no "formal" protocol
in the sense that TCP/IP is a formally specified protocol.
One reason you don't see much about how the protocol works is that
since it is embodied in trade-secret source code, it would be
illicit to read the UUCP source code to figure out the protocol
(and then use or publish that information in non-Unix-licensed environments).

I developed my own knowledge and versions of UUCP completely from the
outside, without any reference to UUCP source code.  This turned out
to be a tremendously more difficult task than I had originally
anticipated.  It involved almost two years of experiments and
endless experimental versions that "sorta" worked or worked only
with some sites.  One of the problems was that I never had any
way to know what I DIDN'T yet know--until one day some new site
would call me and everything would stop working.  Then it was
back to the drawing board.

Over a long period of time, mainly by trial and error, I've gotten
to the point where my own versions of UUCP and related programs
(mail, netnews, rdmail, etc.) seem to be compatible with all known
Unix UUCP's.  I've even got 822 domain support built into my latest
versions.  But when people complain that it has taken me so long
to make these available (particularly the MSDOS version) I can
only point out that it all (from the communications level to the
problems of incompatible filenames and file formats) was a LOT
of work and that I had to do everything on my own time without
any outside support.  I'll be releasing my MSDOS uucp/mail/netnews/
remote access package, including domain support, as a complete package.
For people who don't need all that stuff (and it is a LOT of stuff)
I'll be happy to discuss unbundling UUCP itself or other parts
of the package if people really want it.

Once the various versions of UUCP have settled down again,
I'll try get back to writing up a "formal" protocol spec, which
would include communications info, file naming and handling,
timing constraints (this turns out to be much more critical
than one would think, especially on small machines) and all the
other stuff I've learned over the last couple of years.  Since
all of this knowledge was gained without looking at Unix UUCP source,
I'll be happy to share it once I can put it into a coherent 
framework and I finally have some spare time.

----

Frankly, if I had all of this work to do all over again, I probably 
wouldn't have started.  It was simply too much work and ate a substantial 
chunk out of my life.  What would I have done instead?  I'd have used an 
automated Kermit for everything.  Which is what I currently recommend to
people trying to get fancy file transfer programs going with new
machines.  I am big Kermit fan.

P.S.  If you have any questions, please contact me directly.
      I'll be happy to help.  But these poor lists are already
      overflowing!  Let's try give them a break.
