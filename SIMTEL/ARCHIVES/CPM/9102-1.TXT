Unless I'm mistaken (Its been known to happen), the Xebec card
is a SASI->ST506 disk controller.  SASI was some long lost SCSI
predecessor (probably not compatible with today's SCSI stuff).
(I inhereted an Adaptec controller with a HD cabinet I bought
second hand.  The bus interface card I got with it was for a true blue
IBM-PC I.)

It was the popular thing to do back in the late '70's.  A host
to SASI interface was a real simple card, containing little more
than some buffering logic.  The SASI cable was usually a 50-pin ribbon
cable.  The SASI->ST506 controllers would work with ANY host SASI
adapters, and therefore a manufacturer only had to make one real
disk controller.  The SASI->ST506 controllers I've seen were designed
to be mounted either in a special slot in a hard disk enclosure, or
as a daughter board to ONE of the disk drives logic boards.  The
disk controllers would control up to 2 ST506 type devices.  (They
usually had only 2 data cable connections).

Will it work in your Kaypro?  My guess is only if you can find a
Kaypro->SASI interface card to produce the signals needed on the
50 pin cable, or if the Kaypro HD interface is already SASI.  Sorry, I
can't seem to find any specs on the SASI bus either.  Anyone else?
How about a Kaypro expert who knows how the Kaypro HDs work?

She might try 22DISK on her DOS machine.  I use it all the time

I saw a Kaypro 10 first time for 6 years ago, and now I finally managed to
buy myself one. Wow is this great!

It's goit the standard 10 MB half height HDD installed. Is there any
possibility for adding a second 10 MB disk drive, or possibly even one of
greater capacity? The controller board seems to have one free
data/controller cable connector.

Is there any possibility to speed the whole machine up a little, f ex
changing the crystal to a bigger one (if this help at all)?

Is there a VT100 emulator program which would work at 9600 or 19200 bps? If
I wanted hardware flow control too, am I completely out of Kaypro's
capabilities/the software done this far?

No, the only HD controllers that will work directly with the K10 are the two
variants of the WD-1002-xxx, where xxx is either 05 or HDO.  They are the same
HD controller, but the 05 version also has a floppy controller added in.

I believe - but I'm not absolutely sure - that the Xebec is an SCSI input
controller.

It's a 5 mb drive.

Looking through the schematics for a SASI -> ST506 controller, it looks
like all it's missing is parity.

You can still do this with SCSI. See the latest issue of The Computer
Journal, which contains a SCSI adapter for Z80s consisting of an Intel
8255 and a few OR gates.

You could build a fairly simple SCSI or SASI interface that would plug
into the WD1002-05 port on a Kaypro, but you'd have to write all the
software yourself.

Hello:

Yes, we have a Cromemco C-10 SP (suspect SP means serial port?) and
don't know the pinouts.  It sure would be nice to have a printer

Anybody got docs that could be copied, or know whether any kind of

port?  

Thanks in advance.  Email replies or posted are fine.

The Advent and several other replacement ROMs allow you to use very large

and a Microscience HH-1090 80 meg (of which I get 56 megs due to a 
limitation in the Advent rom).  
 
Most people I talk with think the Advent rom is the best.  They have gone

supposed to be getting set up to sell them for Bridger Mitchell.

Using the mailer "Pine" (like "ELM", I guess) here at UW, they have made
the program inaccessible to vt52 and Adm3a, which the Otrona Attache emulates.
The Attache has some pretty neat screen capabilities.  I don't know why they
won't set Pine up for Adm3a anyway; I turn all the fancy reverse highlighting 
etc. off on my antique MsDos machine, too.  But they haven't.  It would be 
great to be able to use the Otrona to its best advantage, like on trips.  A
laptop it's not, but it Can Be Moved.  

To anyone's knowledge, was there ever a terminal emulator for the O which 
would set it up as a more contemporary terminal?  I could also use one for the 
Morrow.  I guess I can learn to get along without it if I have to, but I like
Pine a lot better than the regular mail program on unix.

Some SASI devices supported parity, and some not. The 50 pin
connector designations are pretty standard, except for pin 26
?? which is used on some SCSI disks to power the terminators.
  I had Turbo Pascal software to execise a SASI interface on
a PC, and it worked ok connected to a SCSI disk.
   SIMTEL20 has some samples of SASI CP/M BIOS's . Although
port assignments will vary with your interface, the logic
flow/command set is standard.

in my backyard -- no disks or anything, I plan to scrap the thing for parts,
(sad, but I already have enough CP/M machines, Stop me, before I kill again.)
Now if I had some boot disks..... ?????

Now, as for Cromemco, they still exist (sort of) they call themselves Dynatech, and have mostly forgotten about the Z80 Cromemco stuff.
I called them a while back and they had one guy handling old Cromemco stuff
they had most of (some of) the manuals in stock for not-too-unreasonable prices.

If it is actually a P&T board, then it is one of two things.  If it is NOT
S-100 then it is for a Tandy Model-II... series and is a clock/calendar/
bell board.  Give-away would be a flat lithium battery on the board.

If it is S-100 then I believe it is probably an IEEE-488 board.  Gregg and
George tried to make several such boards after they gave up on software.
Didn't have much success.  They MAY have made a video board, but I don't
remember any such.

Either Kermit or Xmodem should work fine for you, as they are both 
implemented on MSDOS and CP/M.  Kermit has the added advantage of
sending the file name across the transfer, and some implementations
accept wild cards.

The problem that you will have is getting a Kermit or Xmodem built
for your machine.  CP/M communications programs are tied to the 
hardware because CP/M is too limited to provide those kinds of services.

One other alternative you may not yet have considered is the retrieval
of the files directly from the 8-inch disks.  It is true that the
5.25" formats varied wildly between the various CP/M machines, but
8" formats (for those machines that supported 8" drives) were more
standard.  You may try to find a Zenith Z100 owner (there is a newsgroup
for Z100s) who has 8" drives, and see if they can read your disks.
The Z100 is/was a dual processor (8085/8088) box that could run either
CP/M or MSDOS and could pass files back and forth.

	Greetings. Someone sent me some uuencoded-binary files to my

	get them to my Kaypro 10. I went even as far as getting a

	So, anyone have a K10 uudecode program? Here again is the
	problem, if you send me a .COM file, I have no way of getting
	it to the K10 (catch22??)

	I'm using MEX114 (Modem Executive) but as far as I can tell, it
	only handles ASCII capture... I have a X and Z modem transfer
	programs for the UNIX side of the problem, I just don't have anything
	for the K10.

	By the way, these are small files - I don't care if your solution
	runs at 110 baud :-)

	Again, I can go to Simtel and get stuff (that's actually where
	I got the software) but I can't get the binary files to my K10.

	Take care.

	P.S. I tried UUENCODING the files into text, using ASCII capture,

Subject: 3.5inch HD disk formats: Why not 11*1024
Message-ID: <11344@uhccux.uhcc.Hawaii.Edu>

I just found this message I always wanted to post but never got around to. I
think it was posted to the INFO-CPM side, but never made it to comp.os.cpm.
So here we go:

A while ago there was a long discussion in this space about what the
maximum usefull capacity of a 3.5" disk in HD mode should be. I
remember Dave Goodenough claiming that he runs his with 10*1024+1*512
byte sectors per track, which Tilmann Reh found disgustingly
incompatible, therefore Tilmann uses 10*1024 and frowns on Dave.

Anyhow, we were just re-writing the formatting routines of my disk
controller. We came across something very strange. We claim that
11*1024 is legal ! Here's how the numbers work out:

A 3.5" HD drive is equivalent to a 8" DD drive (500kHz data rate MFM),
except that it spins at 300rpm instead of 360rpm. Lets express that as
saying that a 3.5" drive spins at 5rps. Therefore a track contains
500kHz / 5rps = 100000 bits = 12500 bytes, whereas a 8" track contains
10416 bytes. By the way, the data sheet for a Toshiba ND3561 drive and
for Mitsubishi 3.5" drives agree on 12500 bytes per track, whereas the
data sheets for 5.25" HD drives (which spin at 360rpm like 8" drives
when running in HD mode) say 10416 bytes, just as they should.

Now the overhead on each track. It consists of track header:
- Gap 4a:         80 bytes (content 4E)
- Sync:           12 bytes (content 00)
- Index mark:      4 bytes (3xC2, FC)
- Gap 1           50 bytes (content 4E)
then for each sector:
- Sync:           12 bytes (content 00)
- ID adress mark:  4 bytes (3xA1, FE)
- Sector ID:       4 bytes (Cyl, Head, Sect, Len)
- Sector ID CRC:   2 bytes
- Gap 2:          22 bytes (content 4E)
- Sync            12 bytes (content 00)
- Data mark:       4 bytes (3xA1, FB)
- Data:         1024 bytes
- Data CRC:        2 bytes
- Gap 3            n bytes (content 4E)
and after all sectors:
- Gap 4a:          m bytes (content 4E).

This layout of a track was obtained from the data sheet of the WD 37C65
controller (which agrees with the 176x and 179x controller family, and
with the 2797 actually used in our controller board), and agrees with 
the ones listed in several different drive data sheets.

Therefore, each sector occupies 1086 bytes (1024 net plus 62 bytes
overhead), and there is an additional track overhead of 146 bytes.

Now, we still have to calculate the lengths of Gap 3 and 4a, called n
and m so far. Gap 4a has to be at least 16 bytes, but most formats seem
to use at least 120 bytes, so we stick to just setting its minimum
length at 120 bytes. Now just take the total track length (12500),
subtract track overhead (-146), subtract the minimum length of Gap 4a
(-120), and subtract the space required for data sector (-11*1086).
That yields 12500-146-120-11*1086 = 288. 

Now take these 288 bytes which are left, and distribute them evenly
over the 11 Gap 3s, making each 26 bytes long. In the 176x data sheets
a length of 24 bytes for gap 3 is recommended, so we are safely within
specs. Then the rest of the track (11x26 is a little less than 288 due
to rounding) is filled by letting Gap 4a get as long as it wants
(therefore in our case Gap 4a will be at least 120 bytes, usually a
little longer).

By the way, according to the 176x data sheet the limit of 24 bytes for
gap 3 (as indeed all gap lengths we used above) is already increased
above the functional limit to account for motor speed variation, PLL
lock up time, write splice area etc. Supposedly one can cut all gap
lengths in half (most gaps can theoretically be as short as 2 bytes)
and it would still work. So we seem to be far on the safe side.

Conclusion: 11x1024 is a legal format, and actually leaves a little bit
more safety margin than recommended in the controller data sheet. So,
why does nobody use it? And therefore, why should we be the first ones
to find that out?

Thanx for enlightenment, and don't start a religious war over this one.

Hi!

Could anyone point to a binary file editor that can do search and
replace op's? I want to touch up some text files that I down loaded
and it is getting tedious.

I think there was a program in Simtel that converts a CP/M file to
Unix... but I often need something MUCH MORE general purpose!

(I HAVE been playing with ZAP, but it doesn't do replace. If it does,
I know not how... someone can tell me how to do even "edit" on
this thing... Poor documentation!)

Thank you.

P.S. Oh, I need something more general than CPM2UNIX because I am
doing the opposite: from LF to CR or NULL. And, TAB to SPC. And,
and, and, other silly things like that ...

Message-ID: <316@fxrs.intel.com>

I have a Radio Shack model 4 w/ Montezuma Micro's CP/M 2.2.  I bought a 2400
buad modem a few months back, and while I've endured a problem with not
getting the first characters of the line, I can't stand this problem anymore.

I'm using Qterm 4.2f and I've also used MEX 1.12 (or some old version like
that).  Both worked beautifully for me when I had 1200 baud capability, but
now it seems that 2400 baud is too fast.  Is this true?  How do I fix it?  Is
it a problem of my machine waiting too long at the end of the line before
continuing on to the next line?

This is really annoying, and as I have wanted to get on a couple of new
bulletin boards around town, I can't effectively use them, since they're menu
driven, and the first 3-4 characters are lost, I can't read what character to
use for a particular function.  Sometimes it's intuitive, but most are not.
 

Has anybody else had this problem?  How do you solve it?  Is it a BIOS zap? 



HELP!!!!!

Great, but has anybody actually swapped a 3.5" drive for an 8" drive
and gotten it to work as an 8" drive (I admit that it wastes part
of the 3.5" drive!)??  There is *SOME* attraction in replacing noisy
8" power hogs with newer, quieter hardware *WITHOUT THE ADDED HASSLE
OF SOFTWARE MODIFICATION*.  Part B of the question is, what is the
wiring mod. on the drive connector??

>>now it seems that 2400 baud is too fast.  Is this true?  How do I fix it?  Is
	Well, I run a custom port of TurboDOS on my Model 4P, and
using a simple CP/M style comm program (it makes the TurboDOS "call
0050h" calls instead of the BDOS ones) it has *no* problems with
newlines. (The RS232 driver in the OS is interrupt driven feeding a
128 or 256 byte (I forget which) ring buffer, which helps a bit.) It
does lose when there is a large amount of text (ie a full 24x80 screen
with mostly 60 columns per line...) but upping the buffer size would
probably solve that. (this is at 2400 baud; I've *never* had loss at
1200.)
	There was a standalone comm program that used the same
driver... it would run at 19.2Kbaud without losing data! No OS
overhead at all - the disk had a bootloader which read in the terminal
program, which talked to everything directly.
	There is one important trick, which I suspect MM CP/M doesn't
do. The Model 4 video controller has a register which tells it what
address (in the 2K block) should appear at the top of the screen. In
order to scroll, my driver puts blanks in the 80 characters *after*
the last line, then adds 80 to the register (24x80 = 1920, 25x80=2000,
2K = 2048, so there is room...) *poof* instant scroll (or at least,
one that requires touching 80 bytes, not 2000...)
					_Mark_ <eichin@apollo.hp.com>
ps. Both the TurboDOS port and the comm program were done by myself
and Jon Luning when we worked for DOKAD Inc, a CP/M consulting firm
that I think is gone now (the president had health problems and didn't
have time to continue to run it, and the technical staff all graduated
and went off to college...) I apologize for not being able to
distribute the code; I'm certainly willing to discuss details of the
code for anyone who wants to try using the same techniques.  _Mark_

This doesn't soud right. I've been using Mex on my Amstrad for ages, and
it certainly does have file transfer capability, although the docs aren't
all that easy to read. The R command receives files, the S command sends
them, see the .DOC file for additional info. 

Has your version of Mex had the appropriate overlay installed? There's
one called MXO-KP41.ASM - I assembled and loaded that, and it works just
fine on the K10. I can't see that it should make any difference to the
R and S commands though, they ought to be independent of the overlays.

Subject: PacPerson for CP/M

PacPerson for CP/M is almost (REALLY ALMOST and REALLY NOT QUITE) ready
for release. Prior to the release of PacPerson R2.0, I need serious
testors to help me out.

These are the criteria:

   -that you have a complete QTerm patch available for your own terminal/
    computer and know how to patch it unto a QTerm.Pat compatible
    program.
   -that you have a good knowledge of what kind of bugs can plague a
    program like this (real-time, interactive) and what kind of
    situation can bring those bugs out.
or -that you have a VERY sharp eye for cosmetic and gramatical mistakes
    and such. Spelling checker is a plus; this is primarily to check
    the documentation.

And, of course, you must enjoy playing games.


If you are simply interested in playing the game and having a good time,
please be patient so you may benefit fully from the most finalized
version. I will post an "it's ready" message when R2.0 is ready for
distribution. (R1.0 is identical in features and appearance to R2.0,
so any pre-distribution distribution will cause a general confusion!)

If you are hyperanxious about getting the game when it is released,
drop me a line saying so. I will distribute it directlyl to you
provided I have a valid network address. (It'll take me a while to
be able to type in those long UUnet addresses correctly... :-)  )

Thank you very much

      -John Shin (JSHIN@HampVMS.bitnet)
                 (JSHIN%HampVMS.bitnet@cunyvm.cuny.edu"

P.S. Why is it called PacPerson? It will be obvious once you play
the game if you have any knowledge of all the arcade derivatives
of Pac Man.

P.P.S. David G. - of course, you qualify automatically!

Subject: ZMP 1.5 on Apple //e with Applicard and SSC
Message-ID: <910208124340.20200c7b@SUMMA.TAMU.EDU>

Has anyone ever installed ZMP on an Apple //e using a PCPI Applicard and
Super Serial Card (or AE SerialPro)?

Better yet, is there a ready-made overlay for it?

I have been trying to write my own overlay.  Actually, I lifted most of the
modem in-out-status routines directly from the QTERM patch for the Apple.
By the suggestion in the doc, I put the 'ret' in the init routine so I can
ignore it while I get the main routines working.

When I run it, ZMP puts up its title scree (proving that the gotoxy works) and
then hangs up.  Actually, it seems to jump back to the CCP (ZCPR3) without
properly resetting the screen output.  The result is, that I type characters
and they get built up in the command line buffer, but nothing happens until
I reset the Apple (performs a somewhat stronger warm boot).  Then all the
pending characters are displayed as if they had been typed at the system
prompt (with returns and such which tries to invoke non-existant programs and
the like).

It doesn't appear to even get as far as loading any of its overlays.

Can anyone help and shed light on this problem?

Thanks.

John D. Baker ->An Apple ZCPR3 nut // [STILL waiting for my CardZ180 :-(  ]

PS.  ZMP appears to send/receive a char to my serial port (SerialPro) as 
evidenced by the RD and SD lights on my modem.  It also appears to flash the
switchhook as evidenced by a click from the modem's speaker.  I got all the
routines installed except the ones to set the parameters of the serial port.

Subject: generic transfer program that works on all cpm machines
Message-ID: <1589@doitcr.doit.sub.org>

Hello friends all over the world!
 
ther was a request for a program to transfer data on a generic basis. 
This can easily be achieved by using two programs, that are available free from
me (disk and postage excepted). They are called CPMTRANS and CPMRECIE.  The 
trick is, to split the 8-Bit information up into two nibble halves. This four 
byte info can easily pass the PUN: device and be recieved by the RDR: device.
Thus, the transfer is happily done in good time via RS232 and a nullmodem cable
in between. Everything else is easy. As for all transfers to MS-DOS machines,
I strongly recommend to use 22DISK, the excellent CP/M format program for IBM
clones by SYDEX. At only 35 US$ (I believe that's the price nowadays) it offers
outstanding performance and hundreds of perfectly predesigned CP/M formats. 
Even Users are no problem for 22DISK.  Roll your own formats in no time at all.
It's a must! 
 
Still - long live CP/M !
(longer live ZCPR!)

This is my third request, but I couldn't say with any certainty that the
first two ever went out.  I have recently acquired several board sets
for California Computer Systems machines, and I would like to see what I
can do with them.  I also have 4 Fulcrum SIO-2 boards, also sans
documentation.   Does anyone out there have anything on any of these 
boards?  Anything at all, even to minimal configuration pointers or
default port addresses would be tremendously appreciated.  I can write
BIOS code for them, but it's easier if I know where to send stuff.  

The boot code for the CCS boards appears to be resident on the floppy
controllers, although I haven't attempted to read these chips.  Also,
the 64K dynamic RAM boards are bank switchable, but there is no
indication on the boards as to how to use the bank switching facilities.

The SIO-2's should be fairly simple, and I expect they will help me
upgrade my Poly-88 (which runs unmodified CP/M) to talk to other
machines. That would be nice.

Anyhoo, if you see this and have any ideas, please drop me a line.  I
reply to ALL mail, at least once. Thanks.

Marc

Yes!!!

I had had the same problem. My machine scrolls only when the monitor
finishes a picture and the electron ray goes to the upmost line.  When
my BIOS wants to scroll, it is waiting in an ENDLESS loop for a flag.
I found that the vert sync signal makes an interrupt. In the interrupt
subroutine this flag is set. The CPU escapes from the endless loop and
does the scroll.

There are two ways to fix this:

1. I copied the complete scroll routine from the BIOS into the modem
program and added a SIO polling routine to the endless loop. In this
routine the CPU saves the bytes coming from the modem into a special
area. So when the CPU waits for the scroll, it gets every byte from
the modem. After the scroll the modem program checks this special
area and prints the characters.

2. After that, I finally succeeded to make my Z80 SIO working in
interrupt mode. So of course the CPU gets every byte from the modem.

    The video driver on your machine is probably too slow in scrolling the
screen up when it receives a line feed.  Probably the only thing you can do
is to get the remote system(s) to send you a certain number of NULL characters
(ASCII 0) after each CR/LF.  Most BBSs have that capability.

This is exactly what is happening. The serial port is ignored
when the screen is being scrolled. Fortunately there is a
solution to this problem. There is an overlay for MEX version
1.14 for the TRS-80 Model 4 which is interrupt driven. The
interrupt routine runs asynchronously from the modem in routine,
deposting characters into a buffer. The modem in routine which
MEX calls, grabs characters from the buffer.
 
The overlay is available in the MEX area of the cp/m file section
on simtel, under the filename MXO-RS32.ASM.  There are earlier
overlays for the model 4 available, but these do not use the
model 4 interrupts.
 
Hope this helps,

I suppose anything is possible given enough disk space and

  There are utilities to allow MSDOS diskettes to be
read on CP/M machines. On Simtel20, there's TRANSFER12

Actually, MEX114 will handle Xmodem and Xmodem batch in both CRC and Checksum
modes.  It will also handle 1k block transmission - Ymodem, but not Ymodem
batch.  You should be able to transfer binary files with no problem.

Also wrong.  ST.COM will transfer binary files with Xmodem protocol also.
Just remember that '^-' gets you out of terminal mode, and figure out how from
the prompt line.

Why not use a 5.25" HD drive?  They usually cost about $10 less, and the swap
*seems* to be easier.  And yes, I have replaced 8" drives on a Xerox 820-II
with 5.25" HD drives.  My next attempt will be on a CompuPro S-100 system.

I have not completed the 820-II project yet, due to the stupid mistake of
plugging my interface board in backwords, and blowing one of the drives (maybe
both).  ARRRRGH!!!  However, I have formatted, sysgened and booted a floppy on
the 5.25" HD floppy.

If anyone is interested, I can send out the modification.  If you have the pin
out of your drive, it's fairly obvious what you need to do .. though not in all
cases.  In addition, you may have trouble with the MOTOR ON signal, which 8"
drives don't have.  Some drives allow you to tie the Drive Select to the motor
on, others don't.  Assuming you have power, there is a one chip solution for
Motor On, should you need it.

I agree 100%.  Great program.  I only needed to roll one format,
and that's not bad at all!  Practically all known CP/M computers
are supported (at least those that support soft-sectored MFM or
FM (if you modify your disk controller...).  I believe you can
make it support 8" as well.

Using Kermit for file transfers with Intterm is no problem, I'm just
wondering if there was a program which would modify the kaypro 10 screen as
a VT52. I used to have this kind of program in my old SVI X'press
CPM/MSX-DOS machine.

What I pity my Kaypro is a 10; in my friend's Kaypro 2 KP-VT52 works with no
problems.

	Greetings. I have used my InfoScribe 1000 with my Apple //e for

	following the User's Manual letter-for-letter...

	Anyone know what the little DIP-switches on the back of Infoscribe
	do? There are 8 of them. I have the Centronics interface installed.

	Are there any tricks involved?

Are you sure that Mex 1.14 (I haven't used it in ages), does Ymodem,
rather than Xmodem-1K?  There is a big difference between the two; True
Ymodem sends the file name and a few other useful details (like exact
file length) with the file.

Because of a fate of the naming, someone called the new Xmodem variant
Ymodem, when Omen Techology had already released a program with another
protocol which they called Ymodem.

This leads to strange things, like the protocol being called True Ymodem
(Omen Technology's variety).  However, Ymodem batch has always been True
Ymodem, to my knowledge.

I don't know anything about uudecode for CP/M, but I can tell you a simple way
to gain binary download capability for your machine.  Quite simply, if you can
get the Intel hex code for kermit via anonymous ftp from
watsun.cc.columbia.edu (128.59.39.1) which is all ascii text, then you can use
the command GENCMD on the CP/M end to generate the kermit executable.  I
believe you can find the official instructions on how to do this at the same
site. 

I recently did the above after I aquired a DEC Rainbow for free and was stuck
with a terminal program that was only capable of capturing ascii text.  Intel
hex files end in .h86 and there are versions of kermit in this format for all
sorts of CP/M machines available at the above mentioned site.  I would be very
suprised it there wasn't one there for the good ole' Kaypro.

I phrased it poorly, I am afraid.  I was attempting to paraphrase the
NightOwl doc file from memory.  What I should have said (and what
NightOwl did say) is '... MEX 1.14 is fully compatible with the emerging
YMODEM specification [...] insofar as the 1k blocks are concerned....'

Hallo all,
I'm using for my two 3,5"HD-disks the format with 11x1024 sectors now
for about two years without any problems. It gives you quite a lot
space on a disk (1.76 MB), which is very nice.
It's a format I found in a formatting program for the 8"-disks and
since the 3,5" and 8" disks are working, as has been pointed out,
the same way I gave it a try and all was fine.

I never told something about (nor ever used) a 10x1024 byte 3.5" HD format.
The only 3.5" HD format I ever defined was 11x1024 byte, giving 1760k
per disk. Perhaps at least Christoph remembers that I was the one who gave
him the algorithms and data sheets for gap calculation (resulting in the
format mentioned above).
Sometime ago someone else spreaded a word about things I would have said
concerning format definitions (kind of the above), which are also absolutely
nonsense. Seems like someone is misusing my name?

However, the discussion with Dave was concerning 5.25" DD formats, where I
use 5x1024 byte (or 10x512, if necessary). Dave argued to put one more 512
byte sector in the resulting gap4 (possible only with 5x1024), which I
strictly claimed (and still claim) ILLEGAL.

For those who still do not know about how to reach maximum LEGAL capacity,
and to end the rumours about my format definitions, here are some facts:

3.5" and 5.25" DD:	5x 1024 per side (200/400/800k)
5.25" HD and 8" DD:	9x 1024 per side (1440k)
3.5" HD:		11x 1024 per side (1760k)
All my formats have zero offset tracks (thanks to CP/M-Plus), so the above
capacities are NET.

The Heath H89 CP/M 2.203 BIOS supported a 5 x 1024 format

Hi there! I am sorry to infringe on ya'll, but I have a problem
and this seemed the best place to get help.  I used to have an
Apple II+ compatible (Franklin Ace 1100) with a Microsoft 
Softcard CPM emulator.  I used the card mainly to run Wordstar.
Herein lies the problem.  I sold the machine when I bought an MSDOS
machine.  I have some files from Wordstar on the CPM disk that I need
to transfer to the other machine.  I have access to the Ace 1100 still,
and it has a 300 baud modem.  The MSDOS machine also has a modem.  I don't
have a terminal emulator for CPM though.  I would like to be able to transfer
the files without having to use the modem, if possible.  I need to find
the CHEAPEST way to do the transfer. I really don't want to buy a program
for a one time usage - if you know what I mean.  I was wondering what kind of
options I have.

We transferred many KB of files between a Model 3 under some version of TRSDOS
and a Model II under some similar version; in the previous case using Omniterm
at 9600  bps to an IBM PC with XMODEM.  No problems.  I would guess that the
software you are using is not set up properly to handle flow control and that
this problem appeared when you went to 2400 bps.  I've also used an IMSAI
with a 4MHz Z80 at 9600 with MEX 1.14, no problems on MB of files.

   If you were losing characters at the start of each line at 1200 baud, then
you're going to lose twice as many at 2400. The problem is caused because the
processor must scroll the screen up one line whenever it sees a line feed. If
your system has a separate video controller then it doesn't usually take too
long and characters are rarely lost even at high baud rates. If your main
processor has to do all the work then characters will probably be lost. The
original Apple IIs with 80 column cards were bad in this respect: they'd
even lose about 5 characters at 300 baud.
   The solution depends on the BBS you're calling, as there's probably nothing
you can do to fix it at your end. Most BBS programs will let you specify a
number of nulls at the start of each line. Try selecting some and see if it
helps.

Unfortunately, that is probably not possible.  MSDOS is requering 640 kb
of memory and a 80x8x processor to run.  CP/M is designed to use max. 64
Kb workspace running under a Z80 processor.  This means that you have to

1) Get a 8088 emulator running
2) a MS-DOS emulator running
3) and then find space for the >600 kb requering programe.

You can, however, transfer files easily.  I know of the commercial
programe called UniForm, and the shareware (?) programe 22DSK, which is
avalilable on Simtel20, and its mirrors.

I have several times used my CP/M machine as an editor, doing the hard
typing parts at home, and then moving my stuff to another machine (by
cable but essential the same thing).

Sorry.

Hello,
here is a Turbo Pascal UUDECODE program - hoping you'll excuse me to not
translate texts into english. I wrote it in a few minutes, so it's not
my usual programming style - but works (first line of the UU file must
be the 'begin' line).				Greetings, Tilmann

	Greetings. To tell the truth, I have downloaded almost all
	the CP/M programs for my Kaypro 10 from Simtel20.
	Anyone know of another source? By the way, I installed
	ZCPR3.3 and I am NOT going back to just CP/M :-)

	Anyone?

	Take care.

Message-ID: <13307@life.ai.mit.edu>

Problems.

My S-100 work has just come to an abrupt halt by the failure of both
Shugart 851 8" floppy drives.  One lost head #2 (the head that is on
the head-load lever) some time ago, the other lost it two days ago.

I find that if apply a light pressure on the heads then I can boot the
system.. but this is obviously non-optimal.

Questions:

	* I need references to repair places.  Where have YOU sent
	  8" drives for repair?

	* Does anyone have a manual for this series drive that has a
	  description of all the jumpers and what they do?  Maybe an
	  OEM manual with schematics?

YOUR help is greatly appreciated.

Subject: Kaypro10 -> centronics printer
Message-ID: <90150@unix.cis.pitt.edu>

	Greetings. I'm in the process of "grasping at straws" - as they say.

	I have 2 computers and 2 printers. I have an Apple //e and a
	Kaypro 10. I have one TEC F10-55 and an Infoscribe 1000.
	Fine.

	I can hook up both printers to my Apple and they work like a
	dream.

	When I hook them up to the K10, I get text that has random
	grabage in many places - quite bad, actually or no text at all.

	The main problem that I'm having is the fact that I have no
	docs for my printers. The TEC has an 8-bit and a 12-bit DIP
	switch while the Infoscribe has an 8-bit DIP switch. I have
	no idea what they do - less experimentation....

	Could the problem be that the Stobe and busy are interchanged or
	that busy is never called by the printer. I have docs for the 	
	computers - no problems there.

	Anyone? The TEC is a Diablo 630 "clone" and the InfoScribe is
	a fast 9-pin dot matrix. The infoscribe is on its 13th box of
	paper so it's not like I just got the printer last week :-)

	Is there a trick? Some line that's not quite standard? Anything!

	Take care.

Oh yeah. IBM put Diskette Changed on pin 34, so any 5.25" or 3.5" HD drive
that you buy these days does that. I've also never seen a 5.25" drive that
ignored Motor On, even way back in the old days.

I've also noticed that PC drive vendors tend to be soldering in the drive-
select jumpers these days. I was looking for a drive for a CP/M machine, and
had to look for a while before finding one that wasn't hardwired to be drive
1; that's because IBM put this funky twist in their drive cable that swaps
the drive selects around and gives then individual control over the drive
motors. Of course, the BIOS just goes ahead and turns on both drives at the
same time...

Actually, there is a major difference between 3.5" and 5.25" that I came 
across in a floppy controller data sheet that probably explains why my attempt
to replace the 8" drive on my system failed miserably; I've not tried again
using the new information, so I can't say if that's the problem.

3.5" drives use CMOS drivers for the signals that they drive, and therefore
cannot drive the terminators generally used for 5.25" and 8" drives. The
data sheets for the Intel 82077A therefore recommend that if you are going to
mix 3.5" drives with 5.25" drives, you include a buffer between the 3.5" and
5.25" drives so that the drive doesn't have to try to drive the 5.25"
terminator.

I finally found a home for my CP/M emulator.  You can ftp the latest version
from sipb.mit.edu in directory pub/druid.  Thanks to Mark Eichin for making
this available to me.  I will try to keep that version up to date as I add
improvements and enhancements.  I think it is almost ready to be called a
distribution version but I am still cleaning it up so any suggestions or
comments are welcome.

"I have a list" :-)... actually, I've lost it, but I grabbed it from
BRL.MIL not too long ago.  Try FTP'ing over to there and checking the
most obvious spot(s).  The list includes known public/anonymous allowed
FTP sites, but you can search for CP/M (or anything else) with FIND
or SEARCH or ?.  If you like I can search for it on my system here and
send it to you as well.

Subject: Hard drives and the K10
Message-ID: <91110@unix.cis.pitt.edu>

	Greetings. I have a Kaypro 10 and just installed ZCPR 3.3
	It runs very well, so far. However, unlike CP/M, it has 
	_many_ utilities written for it - somehow the 10MB drive
	was not meant for this OS...

	I know about TurboROM but am not willing to invest the 
	big money (for me, anyways) in a computer that will be
	replaced with a 33MHz 80486 in a few months...

	I still want to keep my K10 to help other people who have this
	machine in our local computer club (PACC)

	Now, I just got 2 nice hard drive enclosures complete with PS'es
	and mounting hardware. I was thinking of getting some cheap,
	used, 10MB hard drives (4 more for a total of 5, 1 in the K10 and
	2 in each enclosure) What I'm planning to do is get a long
	(less then 3 feet - noise, you know) ribbon cable and just
	running it to each drive. Then, on the front panel, have a
	nice 5-way switch. 

	This switch would only be in the prototype. I was thinking of
	using either the parallel port or (best) the modem port to
	control the drives with software. I have a feeling it CAN be done
	and I will try no matter what anyone says :-) 

	So, what I would like is any info on which lines to switch.
	I know about the fact that I have to make sure that ZCPR 3.3
	knows about the change and that my program should make sure that
	the disk is not accessed _while_ I'm switching drives.

	Now that I think about it, ZCPR's path might have problems
	unless I install an identical A0:BASE on all drives (not
	a big waste) If I just run a BBS on my K10 then I don't
	even need to do that since the program will be specificly
	written with these "features" in mind.

	Anyone? Comments? Criticizms? 

	Take care.

	P.S. Please, anyone know why an Apple //e would print on
	a printer just fine and a K10 would give garbage every 5-10
	characters - or not print at all? help....

From: Is PShirley getting married bare-footed? <JSHIN%HAMPVMS.BITNET@YALEVM.YCC.Yale.Edu>
Subject: Long messages and source codes...

Hi!

Could we refrain from posting source codes and really long messages on
the list?

Here is a reason:
For those of us who subscribe to Info-cpm via BITNET, the messages get
"compiled" into a digest every day. That is, instead of many messages
trickling in, we get "chunks" of messages ALL AT ONCE, sorted by alphabet.
That is, if you send a 8K message with a subject that begins with "A,"
we can't get to the next message until about a minute of scrolling later.

Which brings to the next reason:
Many of us are "poor amateurs" making do with whatever we come across.
I.E., we often don't have a 9600 baud modem hooked up at work via
dedicated lines... Until few days ago I was using a 300 baud modem,
but even at 1200 or 9600, for that matter, scrolling through message
you don't want to get to something with a VERY interesting topic
(often beginning with Z-...) is not that fun.

Do this instead:
direct your messages to people who requested it (try not to use
"reply" features of your mailer) or post a "notice" saying what
is available and how to contact you.

Thanks!!!   :-)

    -John

P.S. This is generally not a problem as compared to, say, info-IBMPC,
or games-L where lots of endless discussions take place every day. I
am not the most networkically responsible person, but here's my
penny's worth.

P.P.S. This is a long message, too, but it seemed "general" enough. If you
disagree, you know where to get me: NOT info-cpm, but JSHIN@HAMPVMS.bitnet

   When I fix my CP/M machine, I'll have a look through the sources and see

I got ZMP to work on my Kaypro 10 a couple of months ago.  As I recall,
I had to add an ASEG statement at the head of the M80 source.

You can actually do some major diddling with the BDOS if you want and
modify the directory block size. It's a major hack, but I did it on my
Cromemco system to allow me to make use of a kludged hard disk I hotwired
in. It got a bit flaky with anything that was explicity accessing
directory records but if you're running a 'single application' box
and you need to up the file size, it's a good bet.

I found a Hayes Micromodem 100 in a surplus store, with documentation.
Unfortunately, the one part that is not described iss the part I did not
get; the MICROCOUPLER. The Microcoupler was a Bell Labs proprietary device
that coupled the modem to the phone line. If you have technical
info about the Microcoupler, or info about something similar (or even a spare
Microcoupler) I would love to hear from you.

Thank you.

The ModelIV does not have a dedicated video display system. This leaves
3 options. A modem with a good character buffer that captures in response
to a flow control signal from the PC. (ie. drop DTR before each scroll
call). 2) Line delays on the BBS. (beware of using nulls for timing loops
with the ModIV. Some comm packages actually display the NULLs). 3) Cyclic
(non)Scrolling. Write your term emulator to go to the top line of the screen
instead of scrolling when it hits bottom. DO NOT TRY TO DO A SCREEN CLEAR
WHEN YOU HOME THE CURSOR! Clear screens on the IV take 400-700ms. Enough time
to lose MAJOR amounts of data. When I implemented kermit on the IV, I had
to disabled the status display because it actually slowed down the system 
enough (doing cursor addressing) to drop characters often enough to piss me
off. 

Cheers.

While I agree with the satement, note that some drives have a jumper which
allowes you to use the Drive Select signal for Motor On.  This allows the drive
to ignore Motor On.

Shucks, pull out the terminator. If they're driving the circuit with
CMOS, you won't need it--they were designed originally for open-
collector drivers, which CMOS isn't. If all else fails, build a 
replacement terminator out of higher value resistors. 

It's been my experience that drives and controllers work fine even
when double terminated, both hard and floppy. We've never had a
problem at work (we build ISA systems) with weak signals from 3.5"
drives, and we intermix them constantly.

GENCMD wasn't included with all CP/M implementations. However, you
can suck up the hex file into DDT and when you save it out, it'll
output as binary. (there are docs for this in the BIOS, BDOS and DDT
manuals)

Message-ID: <"14-Feb-91  9:24:24 EST".*.Michael_D._Sprague.wbst311@Xerox.com>

It was suggested that I post the the "one chip solution" for generating Motor
On to a 5.25" HD drive, when making it act like an 8" drive.  Note that I have
*NOT* yet tried my one chip solution .... I will as soon as the NEW drives I
ordered arrive.  Grumble be VERY careful that you don't plug things in
backwards!!!  If something is wrong with this, PLEASE let me know!  I have been
known to make mistakes in the past.  :-)

Since most 8" drive motors are AC and *USUALLY* always spinning (though there
are hardware solutions for this), there is almost never a Motor On signal in
the 8" drive interface.  Some 5.25" drives allow you to set a jumper in order
to use the Drive Select signal for Motor On.  Other drives (Epson for example)
do not seem to do so.

In addition, there is only one drive select line for a 5.25" interface.  While
I am not sure on this, I believe IBM's twisted cable allows them to use one of
the unused Drive Select lines for a Motor On signal, thus they have a Drive
Select *AND* a Motor On signal for each drive.  Let's hope that the high
density drive manufacturers are not making drives specifically for IBM's
twisted cable .... that is, I am banking on the fact that you can still power
*BOTH* drives Motor On signal at the same time like you can for most 360k
drives.  If you can't, this is a serious hiccup in the one chip solution.

Last note that the drives use reverse logic, that is, active low signals.  For
drive select to be active, it must be low.  For the motor to turn on, Motor On
must be low.

A truth table for a two drive system:

 DS0 | DS1 || Motor On
-----+-----++---------
  0  |  0  ||    X	This should never happen.
  0  |  1  ||    0	Drive "A:" has been selected, Motor On.
  1  |  0  ||    0	Drive "B:" has been selected, Motor On.
  1  |  1  ||    1	Neither drive is active, Motor Off.

So if you make the "X" condition a logical "0", you have the truth table for an
AND gate (7408).  Of course, you can also use a NAND gate (7400) and take the
output into both inputs of another NAND gate (4 of them on a 7400), which will
make it act like an inverter.

For a system with more than two drives, use a 7411 for three drives or a 7421
for 4 drives.  Again, by using one of the spare gates in the chip as an
inverter, you could also use a 7410 or a 7420.

Remember, it is a good idea to put a capacitor between Vcc and ground.  A .1uF
ceramic disk should do.

In my case, on a Xerox 820-II, I have a 5 Volt power line in the interface
cable.  I have a small wire wrap perfboard cable adapter which ties the correct
lines in the 820s drive interface cable to the cable that goes to the 5.25"
drives.  This chip will be mounted in the center of the perfboard.  While power
is not a concern, I will probably use LS TTL chips, because I have them.

The CompuPro S-100 will not be so easy, assuming I need to do this.  For it, I
will have to pull 5 Volts from the floppy drive power supply itself.

The Kaypro 10 does indeed use the ST506 interface.  The internal card
is made by Western Digital and will support up to 3 physical hard drives.
The native Kaypro ROM, however, will not support but ONE hard drive, and
a different ROM (such as TurboROM from Sage Microsystems East) is needed
for additional hard drives, or to support more than 10 megs on a single
hard drive.  ST412 (standard MFM) drives work well with the K-10 disk
controller.

My thinking is that your best bet is still the modem route, slow as it
may seem.  Put your sender and sendee together and connect them with a 
null modem cable and xfr and whatever max speed the systems will accept.

The K-10 native ROM will only support one hd of 10 megs.  If you replace
the native Kaypro ROM with a TurboROM, you can use up to two hard drives
of 56 mb each.

I have heard of people doing this, but be careful.  Too much speed

The Kaypro video is notoriously slow, and you must be careful with any 
software which must wait for the K-10's video to update the screen.  I
have to set 9 nulls for screen captures from remotes RAS's on my K-10 or
I lose characters.  

At the risk of sounding like a commercial, I'll repeat again that the 
current source for the Kaypro TurboROM is Sage Microsystems East.  The
BBS number there is 617-965-7259, vox 617-965-3552.  Send snail-mail to
Jay Sage, Sage Microsystems East, 1435 Centre St., Newton Centre, MA
02159-2469.  BBS password is DDT.
 
I have 2 K-10's in the house, both of which have TurboROMs and I'm very
happy with the system improvements they provide.

At least I am here, still looking for a working copy of the VT-52 emulator
(kp-vt52.lbr) for Kaypro 10, or other high speed VT-something emulator for
it. Have been quiet because of the lack of a good (or 'good') terminal
program (I use a 9600 bps modem ;).

Subject: BBS software for Kaypro "8" ??
Message-ID: <1991Feb14.131608.2120@dcs.simpact.com>

Hi, folks,

I have a Kaypro "8" (was a K-2, now 4 mhz, 2x780K, 1x390K), a spare phone line,
and a need to set up a low-end BBS. 

The BBS probably needs a few topic areas, and the ability for users to upload
(possibly non-plain-text, eg MS-DOS WordPerfect) files for downloading by other
users.  2400 bps minimum, it would be nice to support faster.  

What CP/M BBS software would be best, and where would I go to get it???

Assuming that dirty heads are not the problem, have you lost the spring that
loads the upper head?

Pleeeeeeeeeze don't do us any favors.  If large "mail/code/whatever" files
start showing up on this feed, Simtel will drop the mail feed that many of
us depend on.  Leave it in the Simtel20 archives, and don't worry about
"the load", or set it up on another site with anonymous ftp access.  Don't
get me wrong....I'd dearly love to get my hands on the complete set of
ZCPR stuff (part of the problem with ZCPR is knowing what is necessary and
what is not!), but not at the expense of the Simtel mail feed.

	Due to the negative response (for damn good reasons, might
	I add) I will refrain from doing that... :-)

	Take care.

	P.S. If, however, someone can not get to Simtel or a BBS how

	people that if your want a file, I can uuencode it and send it
	directly to them... :-)

Are you saying that ZCPR will ONLY work on a Kaypro with a hard disk, or is it
capable of running on non-Kaypro, non-hard disk systems? (Such as a DEC
Rainbow)

 I recommend QBBS. I'm biased since I had a hand in putting some mods 
into it but it's a nice bbs package for running a small-medium system. 
You can pick it up from Socrates Z-Node @ (201) 754-9067. If you call 
there, leave mail to Chris McEwen (the SysOp) and he'll let you know 
exactly what you need to get it running. Tell Him I sent you ;-)

The subject says it all -- I am looking for Fastback for my Kaypro 2X.
I have been running my 30 meg hard drive without backups for too long.
Fifth Generation Systems apparently no longer sells it for CP/M.  I 
called Central Computer Products a while back, and they said that it
had been withdrawn from the market.  So, does anyone out there have
a copy lying around unused?

Uhhh... I think the spring you mean is located at roughly where the
two 'arms' of the levers holding the heads meet.  It's there with some
red glop on one end and appears to pass from one side of the lever
assembly to the other.

I can see the upper end of the spring.. but not the lower end.  Will
have to find an inspection mirror to peer underneath.  The upper end
has some red glop on it.

I'm a little nervous about removing the head assembly.  Without an
alignment disk and software to run it, I doubt I'd get the heads back
to where I could read 'em.

Thank you for posting the jumper list.  Very much appreciated.

Regards,
Mark

Subject: TeleVideo communication program?

Can anyone recommend a communications program that will allow a
TeleVideo 1603 to log onto an IBM mainframe?  Right now I'm
using TeleAsync (CPM-86) and Mite (MS-DOS).

My problem is that when I log onto the system it asks if I'm
using an IBM-PC, H19, VT-100, or Microbee. If I reply VT-100
(or H19, Microbee) the screen doesn't clear properly. If I
get a --More-- and hit the page space key it moves the bottom
half of the screen up but doesn't do a clear screen.
It's worse when I reply IBM-PC... Everything appears on one
line.  No LF's or clear screen.

I've tried the Kermit server at Columbia but couln't find any-
thing that would seem to fill the bill.  Of course if I had
found something there would still be the problem of how to
get it into the TeleVideo.  Catch 22 ...

Any ideas?  Suggestions?

Also, I'd like to find a BBS program that would run on this
machine.  It has two floppy drives (760 k) and 256 k memory.
and is hooked to a 2400 bps modem.  Either CPM-86 or MS-DOS
would do...

Thanks.

       TURBOROMS FOR KAYPRO CP/M ARE AVAILABLE AGAIN!

 Recently heard that TurboROMs for Kaypro CP/M computers are available 
again!  They vanished when Advent Products Inc. stopped selling products 
for CP/M.  Someone has bought the rights to make them and they are now 
available for you to your order.  The price now is even lower than 
before.

 The new source is Chuck Stafford, and he lives at 4000 Norris Ave., 
Sacramento, CA 95821.  He is asking $35 each for them and this is a much 
lower price than the $59.95 Advent charged.  It's even lower than the 
previous group rate.  Chuck needs to know which model you have, whether 
'83 or '84, just like before.  For phone order, his number is 
916-483-0312.  Since this is his home phone number, if he isn't there, 
leave your name and number and he'll call you back.  His regular work is 
in another business so you'll have to call his home.

 I have just received one TurboROM I bought from him for myself and 
tested it on arrival.  It tests well and seems to be the same product as 
before.  I would not hesitate to suggest that, if you want a TurboROM, 
give Chuck Stafford a call.  If you've never had a TurboROM before, be 
sure and ask to receive all the documentation and software you'll need 
to install it.

In short:  oooooooh, aren't they luvverly....

Meanwhile, back in the real world, the Z-stuff (I can't think of a better
generic) started with a CCP replacement and went on from there to replace
the whole CP/M 2.2 and 3.0 OSs.  I use ZCPR 3.3 and ZRDOS: the former is
PD, and the latter is now probably outdated.  There are better BDOS 
replacements around, including one sold by Jay Sage called ZSDOS.  The
current version of ZCPR is 3.4, and I *think* it's not much different
from 3.3.

If you are using CP/M 2.2 the message is clear, switch to the Z-system.
It will run on any machine that runs CP/M.  I personally dislike CP/M 3.0,
and even if I liked it, I'd still prefer Z (there's logic for you).  Sage
sells autoinstalling versions of Z, and a lot of related stuff.  Most of
the code is available on Z-nodes scattered around the country.

Why is the Z-system such an improvement?  For a start, it integrates
user areas very effectively; you still have a flat file system, but
you can used named directories and other helpful guides.  It also has
an unrivalled selection of command processors, some memory resident
and some disk based, for repetitive tasks.  It is also very configurable,
both at build time and boot time (and while running, for that matter).
I don't make use of half the Z-system features, but going back to CP/M
I still feel hampered.

Good luck - Will

I believe this is not true.  If the cpu is an 8080 or 8085, Z-system
not work - the cpu must be a Z80 (or one of its variants).

Anyone know for certain?

Actually, if you DON'T get the offer, then you won't be able to use the
1581 in CP/M mode. The version that came with the C128 doesn't recognize
the ormat. There is a kludge out there that will patch the CP/M 3.0 sys
file that will allow the 1581 to be viewed as a *1571* with 340K of
space, but, yuck!!

Also, the package comes with all kinds of nifty stuff for programming in
CP/M.

Oh, yes. It also recognizes an REU as drive M:    Up to 512K worth :)

I hear ya!  I have it running on my Dynabyte DB8/1 with a 20MB
8" (can ya believe it?!!) hard disk, and it is a DREAM!!!  Sadly,
I don't have source code to its BIOS, which, IMHO, needs work,
but I was able to kludge it in.  The machine's design is
something like 11 years old, the machine rapidly approaching 9
years old, and it works beautifully, mainly because I had to move
all my boards into a CompuPro box because the Dynabyte box ran
with an MTBF of something like an hour or so...  In the CompuPro
box, I left it on for a WEEK and it didn't lock up or lose its
mind.

Still having trouble running ZEX with it as hard as I try...

Guess I'll hafta scare up some money so I can snag
NZCOM/ZCPR34/ZRDOS (preferably for Z34 to be in source code form
(grinsmilegrin).

Also, just curious, is ZAS still being sold/marketed anywhere?

I had problems when I went to 19,200 baud, so I wrote an insert for 
Ybbat, the Fidonet mailer, which buffers in characters into an internal 
queue.  I can then take characters off the que.  You could also use an 
interrupt driven system.  I have a Kaypro, so I doubt my code would do 
you much good unless your TRS has a Z80 SIO for serial IO.  If so, the 
file is called YBH-KAY1.ASM, and it is on C1: on my system, The Black 
Box, 713-480-2686, 300-19200 baud.

Amen, brother!  I run Z33 plus NovaDOS on my Dynabyte DB8/1 and
my Ampro Little Board.  Great software!!!  Plus you have source
code if you want to extend its capabilities which are already
great.

I'm running it on an S100 box with 20 megs, and it works like a
champ.  Ran it with 10 before but didn't have many problems.  Had
to be a little conscientious with my management...

Nothing but!!!

Yes, paths are probably the most notable feature of ZCPR33.  And
since you have source code, you can make it as big or small as
you need (I believe it's all in the ENVironment discriptor file).
However, if you plan to have a LARGE number of aliases, don't
bother with ALIAS.  Use ARUNZ.  ALIAS creates small .COM
executable files for each alias, and with my hard disk using
questionably large allocation units, 8K, they can add up fast.
You have all your aliases in one file that you locate at the end
of your path called ALIAS.CMD, which is nothing more than a text
file with prototypes for your command lines you wish to execute.
Regardez:

poll    a5:ccico -x66 -s$1 -f$2 -l

which tells my system to do a UUCP poll (I'll explain about UUCP
for CP/M later) using the first and second arguments as 3-letter
system name and a letter for its script (which can be blank or a
letter from A to Z).  Plus it has other neat capabilities whereby
you can get at information in the environment discriptor, like
the CPR location, BDOS location, whatever.  Plus it can parse
named or DU: type drive addressing.  With a little bit of
ingenuity, I have made PIP, a typical non-ZCPR system utility, to
work with ZCPR33 (and you have to have at LEAST ZCPR33 in order
to use ARUNZ).  It's available at SIMTEL20.  I _EXTREMELY_ highly
recommend it.  Yet I still think ALIAS has its place.  You can
use an alias to tell the system to use a customized startup
sequence if you didn't hardcode it (which is one thing I'm going
to change because I hardcoded the startup sequence, like a
dolt...).  And if you tell it to run a program call "STARTUP",
you can create a specialized alias that suits your needs, and you
can easily change it if your needs change and you don't need to
re-hardcode your command line.

Another great program.  Get it as well.  I have used it zillions
of times and cannot complain at all!!!!

Plus you can have several different named directories on your
disk.  And, like the path, it can be as small or big as you need.
My sytem has 28 entries.  I upgraded from 14 when I was running a
10, and 14 was too SMALL, if you can believe that!  Now, I have
room to expand if need be.  Same went with the path, only I
upgraded to 10 elements from 5.

That's optional.  It's a great facility to have available.  You
don't need to reload PIP every time you want to do this.

Word of caution:  It is EXTREMELY huge.  Something like 130K
total.  It's available at a BBS I call locally (uploaded it
myself).  It's at Omni BBS, (916) 386-2521, in the room CP/M
ZCPR3/ZCPR33, I think (it's a Citadel-type system).  My handle
there is IJ if you want to shmooze with me there.

Does anyone know if there are any problems with using one of the
accelerated 6502 replacements (4, 8Mhz ZipChip) when running the PCPI
Applicard's operating system?

I assume that if you properly set it up, there should be no conflicts and
you should actually see some performance improvement (except disk drives),
especially in terms of character I/O.

If anyone runs the Applicard (or even MS SoftCard) on an accelerated
non-GS Apple ][, please let me know about what problems you have/had.

Thanks.

What a flood of questions and comments about ZCPR and Z-System!  Thorbjorn
Ravn Andersen asked:

The subject is much too big to try to answer here.  After all, I have been
writing a regular column in TCJ for close to 25 issues now, and the subject
has still not been exhausted.  I replied to Thorbjorn directly and will
repeat the same offer here.  If you send me a postal address, I can send a
selection of TCJ reprints and other information about Z-System.

Filip Gieszczykiewicz proposed flooding the net with uuencoded Z material, to
which Roger Hanscom replied:

>> Don't get me wrong....I'd dearly love to get my hands on the complete set

Here are my suggestions.

By far the best way to get Z-System running on one's computer is to purchase
NZCOM (if you currently operate with CP/M-2.2) or Z3PLUS (if you currently
operate with CP/M-Plus).  Believe me, I do not say this just so I can make
money.  These versions of Z-System not only configure easily and install
automatically but really offer sustantially superior performance over
manually installed versions of Z-System.  The only good excuse for not going
the NZCOM/Z3PLUS route is not being able to afford the $70.  In that case, if
you have a CP/M-2.2 system and know how to modify the BIOS, you can install
the ZCPR33 command processor, which has been released for public distribution
(though copyrighted).

With NZCOM/Z3PLUS you already get a good selection of support utilities.  The
best way to get the rest if you do not have convenient access to a Z-Node BBS
or to SIMTEL20 is to sign up for ZSUS, the Z-System Software Update Service. 
ZSUS offers a disk subscription service.  Roughly once a month, you get a
diskette with about 250K of newly released Z-System software collected from
Z-Nodes.  (Lately, new programs have been appearing in such volume that new
diskettes are appearing more often than once per month.)

ZSUS also offers some nonsubscription packages.  One includes about 350
programs in executable form.  Another includes a rather complete collection
of help/doc files for those programs.  A third package contains a collection
of articles from The Computer Journal by me, Bridger Mitchell, and others
about the Z-System and advanced CP/M topics.  Two new topical collections are
in the works (if not already available): a programming pack with tools for
assembly-language programming and a wordprocessing pack with tools for
writing.  These packages typically fill two to ten diskettes and cost between
$10 and $35.  ZSUS offers a way to get a lot of stuff very cheap.  For those
who want complete packages, ZSUS even offers a custom service that allows you
to order whatever packages (LBR files) you want from the complete archive of
Z material.

Eric A. Rasmussen asked:

>> Are you saying that ZCPR will ONLY work on a Kaypro with a hard disk, or
>> is it capable of running on non-Kaypro, non-hard disk systems? (Such as a
>> DEC Rainbow)

When I was developing ZCPR, through version 3.3, I DID NOT HAVE A COMPUTER
WITH A HARD DISK!  You better believe it will run on a floppy-only system. 
For sure it runs much better on a hard-disk system, and even better with a
RAM disk (I now have both), but what does not run better with such support?

In one of my first TCJ columns I described some tricks for making Z-System
work better on floppy-only systems.  On a slow computer, one will not make
heavy use of shells, which have to reload at every command prompt.  With my
RAM disk system, I live in the HSH history/command-line-editing shell.

Unfortunately, Eric then mentions the Rainbow, one of the most irritating
systems ever invented.  DEC was a master at violating standards!  The CP/M on
that machine is neither CP/M-2.2 nor CP/M-Plus, and as far as I know no one
has ever gotten any form of ZCPR running on it.  Other than the Rainbow,
there are very, very few machines on which NZCOM/Z3PLUS will not run with
ease.

Danny commented:

>> I believe this is not true [that ZCPR will run on any CP/M machine].  If
>> the cpu is an 8080 or 8085, Z-system not work - the cpu must be a Z80 (or
>> one of its variants).  Anyone know for certain?

That is largely correct.  Beginning with ZCPR33, we made the decision to stop
trying to support CPUs that do not recognize the full Z80 opcode set. 
ZCPR30, however, could be assembled for the 8080/8085.  I had an Intel MDS-
800 development system on which I ran ZCPR30 in the original autoinstall form
called ZCOM (we could probably still make this available to those who want to
have ZCPR but do not support the Z80 instruction set).  My brother had a
Sanyo MBC-3000, which also had 8080s, and we ran ZCOM on it.

Since the source code for ZCPR33 has been published, people are welcome to
make their own changes to work around the sections where Z80 codes are used. 
The source to ZCPR34 is also available, but not for free.  So far as I know,
no one has made a conversion of the Z33 code for the 8080.  They did make
changes to allow it to assemble with M80 instead of ZAS (with its stupid
square brackets -- sorry, but I wrote Z33 under contract to Echelon, which
sold ZAS as its standard assembler).  Z34 is written using sensible formats. 
The SLR assembler can handle the Z33 source as is, and I think the nice ZMAC
assembler can as well.

This is mostly correct.  Z33, though not legally PD, is PD for most intents
and purposes.  Z34 offers a number of additional features, some of them
rather nice.  The differences are detailed in one of my TCJ columns.  The
main one that comes to mind now is the ability to run relocatable object
files.  The command processor typically loads so-called type-4 programs as
high in memory as possible.  In this way one can have two applications in
memory at the same time, which is nice for error handlers and shells and
extended command processors, all of which are loaded automatically by the
operating system.  It is nice if they don't clobber whatever program the user
was running so that the GO command can start it up again without a reload
from disk.  But Will is certainly right that you get all the really important
functionality in Z33.  You might want to get my "ZCPR33 Users Guide" to learn
more about the features in Z33.

Will is also right when he jokes about ZRDOS's status.  Frankly, I didn't
think very highly of its approach from the beginning.  The ZSDOS/ZDDOS BDOS
replacements really do things right!  They incorporate support for file
time/date stamping in a very efficient and flexible way (the hallmark of Z-
System).  The other spectacular feature is the support for finding files that
are not in the current subdirectory (drive/user).  ZDOS (my name for the
pair) has public-file support, as conceived by Plu*Perfect, and the ZSDOS
variant has a file search path like the command search path of ZCPR.

Hope all of this is helpful!

   another plus to running Babel is that the serial routines Bob used
for the TRS2 are very similar to what will work with kaypro
serial ports.  all you have to do is change the port addresses
and you're all set.

I concur.  I might have to do some fiddling with an SA-851 to get
it to run on a Big Board II.

While I'm on the subject, I'm trying to get a few drives to work
on a Big Board II a friend gave me.  He gave me four 8" drives, 3
SS, one DS.  Two are Memorex SS which don't work at all, one is a
SS Siemens which works perfectly, and a DS Siemens which sorta
works.  I mean sorta because it does not step backward nor does
it home when needed.  I have the strangest feeling that the drive
went south somewhere and I don't know what to look for.  But,
like I said, I have a couple of other 8" floppies which do indeed
work, one a Shugart SA-851, and a Qume Qumetrak 842.  I'd like to
know how to jumper these two buggers so they could work with the
Big Board II aside from drive select which any idot who knows
what he/she/it/other is doing.  I have some docs, and it doesn't
say a thing how to jumper the drives.

Also, does anyone know of software for the Big Board?  From what
I understand, it enjoyed a great deal of popularity in the
Netherlands, and they wrote lots of stuff for it.

Many, MANY thanks in advance.

Subject: Motor on and Drive Select
Message-ID: <FEKETE.91Feb19110642@tnds05.tele.nokia.fi>

Hi,

I was involved in developing floppy controller card for CP/M system and
also wrote floppy handlers. From that time I have bad experiences with 
using Drive Select as Motor On. The main problem is that the drives 
usually report Drive Ready before they reach their nominal speed. For 
example I've read in a NEC manual, that Ready will be active when the
motor reaches 50% of the nominal speed (and of course other conditions are
met too). In our system we used Western Digital WD2797 controller, and so
it had problems, sometimes it wrote faulty data to the disk. It happens
very easily when copying from one drive to another or rather when compi-
ling from one drive to the other. In this cases the two (or more) drives are
selected and deselected very often so the motor is also turned on and off 
completely. If the motor is spinning let's say 20% less than nominal speed
reading can be OK, but when you write the sector needs different amount of
space on the disk, and that can cause then not reliable operation. (At least
it caused with WD2797, although I tried the recommended track structure from
WD manual).
So I would *NOT* suggest using simple AND logic to generate Motor on, or
using Drive Select for that purpose. Rather I have two suggestions:
1. Tie Motor On to GND. Most of the drives are turning off their motors, 
   when there is no disk in them (of course not 8" drives). So the motor
   will spin when disk is in the drive and door is closed. From practice 
   I know that doesn't effect the lifetime too much, especially if you 
   have it in your home system. My home made system was working this way
   for years without any damages in drive or diskettes.

2. Use more sophisticated logic (or combine with SW too). The Motor On should
   work so, that when a drive is selected also Motor On becomes active, but
   a logic delays the Ready signal to be active for a while (depending on 
   drive type, but usually 1-2 seconds). The Motor On can be common for all
   the drives, and activation should start if any of the drives are selected.
   But then after deselecting the drives, the Motor On has to be active for 
   a while to eliminate the idle time if selected again. With my 4MHz Z80
   system by using different compilers and other programs I got to the 
   conclusion that 10-15 seconds delay to turn off Motor On is optimal.
   This solution needs for example some gates and a monostable multivibrator,
   but can be implemented with a programmable output and some software (typi-
   cally it should be a timer interrupt to work in the background.)

I hope that my ideas helped you to get less "BDOS Err On A: Bad Sector"
message. :-)

I sure wouldn't mind having info for CP/M-86 stuff either since I
run a CompuPro 8/16 with Concurrent DOS 8/16 which can also run
CP/M-86 software concurrently.  I'm also in the process of
getting CP/M-86 to run on it, and I've also got Aztec C for it
and am learning C and trying to port HMODEM II to CP/M-86 (give
me Zmodem of all things...).

I've recently acquired the source code to Qterm 4.2G, and Dave is
going to release source with his next release of Qterm, and I
will try to see if I can port Qterm over to CP/M-86 so I can have
Kermit and VT-100 emulation.

As far as MS-DOS stuff is concerned, if you have what I think you
have, you'll be having one heck of a time finding BBS software
for MS-DOS for that machine.  You'd have to get a program that
does not speak directly to the screen on a regular (E)ISA/MCA
computer, and can be adapted to talk to your hardware.

Good luck!

Maybe sometimes true. But not always. I was worrying about the termination 
problems when I first added my new 3.5" drive to the existing system. But it 
turns out to work just fine with a Sony 3.5" drive. Currently my setup is: 
Controller in the middle of two cables. On one side about 10' twisted-pair 
cable to an 8" drive, properly terminated at the drive. On the other side 
maybe 2' of regular flat cable to a 3.5" drive and two 5.25" drives, again 
properly terminated at the last 5.25" drive. I know it shouldn't work, it is 
doubly terminated, and NONE of the drive outputs should handle the load of
two terminators, least of which the 3.5" drive. On the other hand, CMOS output
drivers (see 74HCxxx) are very good at driving resistive loads, sometimes I get
the feeling the are more reliable at that than LS drivers. So trial and error
is in order.

It might increase performance, but I don't know enough to answer
that because I don't know how the Applicard handles the Apple's
timing, or even if it does, whch the Microsoft/Applied
Engineering or any of their clones do.

Like I said, I don't know how or if the Applicard reacts or uses
the Apple's clock system.  One thing I _CAN_ tell you is that you
CANNOT use the Zip Chip with a SoftCard "classic" which will work
in any Apple II, so long as you use the standard 1MHz clock. You
have to realize that this card (or the Z80c or any Z80-equipped
Z-RAM for the Apple //c) is a DMA, or as I would prefer to call
it, a bus master card, because it in effect, when activated,
fully takes over the computer and makes the Apple a Z80-based
computer and it talks DIRECTLY to the hardware, and is clocked
DIRECTLY by the Apple's hardware.  I was told by a Zip
representative that it wouldn't work when he was at our locsal
Apple group meeting a while ago.

Subject: Compilers for Z280

Hello, people,

this is an important question, at least for me. I am in desperate search
for a compiler, preferably Modula-2 or C, WITH SOURCES, that i can get up and
running on an Z280. The plan is to develop an experimental OS which should have
multi-tasking capabilities. I read that the Q/C Compiler had been sold with
source. Is that true ? Can i still buy it ? Can it easily be modified to
support the extended Z280-features?

The pd-compilers i know of have their limitations concerning data structures.
I think, it is possible to modify small-C for the Z280, but it would be
lot of work to support multi-dim arrays, structs etc.

For the modern home computers like atari, amiga or pc's, there are pd-compilers
available (even modula-2), so why not for CP/M?

Thank you for your hints,

                    Ruediger.

  Most of the floppy varieties I have seen are jumperable to allow the
MOTOR-ON signal to control the motor without also using DS.  That is,
MOTOR-ON turns ALL motors on.  This should eliminate any problems
with motor spin-up delays when moving from drive-to-drive.
  In some of the older 8" systems we have about, I set the 8" drives
to all load the head at the same time (whenever head-load was asserted)
to eliminate head settling delay when moving from drive to drive.

really must admit that the K10 is a hell to open. Does anybody know the
function of a small circuit board between the monitor and disks, attached to
the disk system? There are just 2 chips and 2 cables, one going to the cpu
board and one going to the disk controller board - it looks pretty weird, as
one definately could have integrated the 2 chips to cpu or controller

OK, I'll bite - all this raving about Z-system and ZCPR has gotten me
interested.  One kind fellow even suggesting he post the whole thing for
us (admirable intentions).  In lieu of that, how about this - post instructions
about where to get the stuff and how to bring it up.  Here is my question
list about ZCPR..

1 - Can I get it for free ?? (always first in my list), if so where --
SIMTEL ??  Can I get all the source code from SIMTEL?  Where else.

2 - Can I bring it up on my own motley collection of hardware, or am
I stuck unless I have a "supported" system.  In other words can I throw
together a disk controller, Z80 CPU, and one or more 64K ram boards in
an S100 box and bring up ZCPR on it  (apart from the usual S100 hardware
compatibility issues). I am asking this because I have a collection of
hardware gathering dust that this sounds like an interesting project for.
In yet other words - can I get example bios source to start off with?
I assume I can use one of my working CP/M 2.2 systems and M80, L80 to
fire up ZCPR for a new system.

3 - what is the mimum hardware config - I take it it handles bank switched
memory, but will some version run with just 64K of RAM.

4 - how about posting a list of what files to get, where to get them,
and how to get started with this  (I mean "the code is available on Z-nodes
scattered around the country" is a just a tad too vague. :-) )

I like the fact that this is a Z80 software package - I mean, If I had any
8080 or 8085 S100 boards, I would take my coping saw, cut out the circuitry
leaving the fingers and sides of the board (so it would still slide into the
card cage) then I would epoxy a piece of nice perf board with solder pads
into the hole thus generated and use the thing for a wire-wrap board.
(Here's a hot tip for you folks wondering what to do with old S100 boards).

hi, i am the proud new owner of a Morrow CP/M machine!!

i have been enjoyably loading some software from simtel to
my mainframe account. i have a few questions about CP/M:

1) what is the archive program for .ARK's, .LIB's, etc

2) are there any pascal or c compilers out there that i could run
   and if so, how much would it cost for me to purchase them.

what do people recommend for a 2 drive system for shareware software
(remember its a Morrow, not a kaypro, etc) the cpu is a 4mhz Z80

point of interest: are there any benchmark programs out there (preferably in
z80 assembly to give it its best showing) i am curious.


thanx a lot.

p.s. i have found, so far, that the cp/m community is by far the nicest
     group of pc owners yet. i have recieved much help in setting things
     up on my computer. many thanx to all.

Hi folks! Sorry to keep botherin' ya, BUT....... I have a xerox 820-II. I
also have 2 fully functional dual-drive units. I wanna hook 'em all together,
giving me a 4 drive system. I understand that I have to jumper each drive so
it knows which one it is; a,b,c, or d, but my problem is, I don't know how to
hook the 50-pin cables together. Anybody out there able to offer simple(?)
instructions?

BTW, thank you to the Pennsylvania Preacher that was kind enough to respond
to my earlier plea regarding a harddrive for this system..... you really made
the day! Waiting for the travel instructions........... :)

Sorry, you've probably missed the article which made me to write my one. I
have also the experience, that you can always jumper a drive so, that it 
controls the motor only by Motor On. (But still most of them are not spinning
if no disk is inserted. But this is now out of our interest, I think.) The 
problem comes if you don't have signal to drive Motor On. Then you can 
set the drive to control the motor by DS, but that in my opinion is dangerous,
as I wrote it in my previous article. My ideas came for that case.
I'm sorry if you just simply misunderstood me, quite probable that I wasn't
clear enough.

Subject: PacPerson for CP/M

Unless I hear from the people doing the "testing" (yeah, right) for me,
PacPerson for CP/M-Z80 will be ready for distribution on Wednesday,
February 27. (Some arbitrary date that gives me some time to goof.)

So, give me your address, and it will be on its way! You need:

  -A CP/M machine with Z-80-type processor, any speed.
  -cursor addressable terminal; the program comes with two patches (
   one for Televideo TVI-920 and one for ANSI ) and with some
   instruction for quick write-up. Having a complete QTerm patch
   will help.
  -some way of getting the network file to your machine as well as
   a UUDecode.com and un-ARC-ish-something.com. If necessary, I can
   send it in some other format with a little delay.

If you don't have a clue what PacPerson can be, don't be embarrassed;
just drop me a line and all will be forgiven.   ;-)

Enjoy!

Hello.

I just called Sydex and ordered my copy of 22DISK so I can translate
these thousands of files from my Morrows, Otrona, ATR 8000
and etc. etc. (You should see this place! I'll post the notice when 
I have the garage sale.)

During the course of the conversation with the nice person, she suggested that
high on their wish list is a disk in Otrona 96tpi format, just Loaded with 
files.  They would like to add that format to the already over 300 they include
in 22DISK.  Wish I could help them out, but my Otrona is just 
the usual 48tpi model.  So I told her I would post a request on this newsgroup.
Seemed to me that someone with one of those machines would probably like to
be able to translate the files to something else?

Absolutely.  YOu can get the sources for ZCPR33 from SIMTEL as
well as a good many of its utilities.  I have checked a few of
them and they are really nice.

I've done precisely that on MY S-100 box, an OLD Dynabyte DB8/1
originally with 10MB hard disk, now with 20 megs (8" platters,
yet!).  As far as BIOS is concerned, I _sorely_ wish I had source
code for this old boatanchor's BIOS, but after a little
sleuthing, I was able to figger out a way to get it online
without having to make extensive jury-rigging than I already had.
But I'll say this; it works, and it works well!  I've had a great
deal of fun putting this system online.

Re:  Minimum hardware config:  64K is almost a must, but if you
did a little paring down, you could get it running with less
memory, but you won't have as capable a system.  Same goes for
whatever type of mass storage you use.  If you have a hard disk,
it makes using it all the nicer, but you could use it on a
floppy-based system, like I've done on my Ampro Little Board, and
I plan to do the same thing with my Big Board II.  As for your
bank-switching question, you'd have to write the bank-switch
routines yourself if you're running a 2.2 system which you
mentioned earlier.  If you're running CP/M Plus, you have to get
Z3PLUS from either Sage Microsystem East or Alpha Systems.  I
have three extra banks of 48K on this unit, but I'm just too
damned lazy to write the routines to make use of them.

At very least, you need ZCPR33.??? which could be LBR, ARK, or
ZIP (yes, there are several CP/M UNZIP utilities out there).  I
uploaded them to a local BBS in my area.  The number of that BBS
is (916) 386-2521.  The BBS is called Omni, plus it has quite a
bit of CP/M software (I know because I uploaded some 75% or so of
their files, and all of their ZCPR3x files).  Also, if any
Z-Enthusiasts are reading this, and call the system and have
stuff to upload, PLEASE DO IT!!!  I cannot afford to call any
Z-Nodes because there are absolutely no Z-Nodes here in
Sacramento, and therefore all of them are long-distance.  I
cannot start one because my folks would not approve.

Gee, that sounds a little drastic.  I know of a source here in

The program you use for ARK files (they'll work with .ARC files
by PKARC and PKPAK and viceversa (I'm serious!  I've tried it!)).
The other file format, which is .LBR, not to be confused to
routine library files, .LIB, you use NULU and an appropriate
uncrunch program.  I recommend CRLZH11.LBR because it will
uncrunch ALL files, including Huffman (?Q?), LZW (?Z?), and LZH
(?Y?) files.  Better yet, I recommend LT29, then you don't have
to extract a file THEN uncrunch it.  It does both at the same
time, though I still recommend NULU to see what's in there, plus
you might want to pick up LDIR.  There is also a couple of UNZIP
programs that will handle PKZIP archives.

There's Turbo Pascal which can be had from Sage Microsystems
East, price unknown.  Jay?  Same goes for BDS-C.  You can also
get Aztec C, and I believe Manx still supports it.

What kind of software did you have in mind?  I.e. programming,

I keep hearing about a seive program that does the Seive of
Eratosthenes (sp?!?!) and that should be a decent benchmark, but
I don't know, and I at this point don't care how fast my machines
run.  If they can get my job done, great.  If they do that plus
blow me out of my seat, all the more nicer. (grinsmilegrin)

	Greetings. A friend of mine has a Model II TRaSh-80. It's

	Again, I don't think I need a "boot" disk since we have one

I noticed that wuarchive.wustl.edu has mount in "mirrors/zsys"
a large collection of files, presumably from simtel20. There's
also a cpm collection. Access to wuarchive is often easier, faster
than SIMTEL20. Plus, you can arrange to soft mount it via nfs on your

ZMP just downloads, and RZMP dow- and uploads?  What does that
mean?  RZMP is like KMD in that you use it for RCP/M's.  ZMP
_WILL_ upload files, you have to use ESC-S.

Manx Software Systems (201-780-3072) no longer *supports* Aztec C for
CP/M.  When I bought my copy, about a year ago, they were selling their
last release at half-price.  This works out to $99.50 for the
essentials, and about $70 more for the version that can generate
ROM-able code.  Its strength is that it comes a lot closer to K&R than
BDS C.  Its weaknesses are that it compiles slower, generates executables
that are bigger and slower, and any bugs you find in the compiler are 
permanent.

BDS C, on the other hand, is a living product.  Jay Sage is among the
developers, and is easy enough to reach (if enough of us badger him 
about it, they may yet add floating point intrinsics :-).

I need to copy disks for my old Epson computer(which I don't have with me).
I can copy the disks onto a 3.5 inch but when I try to copy from that 
back to my 5.25 inch I am getting disk errors.  I assume that these errors
are do to the different format of the CP/M O-S my machine uses.  The
format for the machine is defined as 10 sectors/track, 512 bytes/sector,
and 2 system
tracks.  If anyone knows how I can format my disks to those specifications,
where I can find a machine to do the straight copy on, or any relevant
info please drop me a line ASAP.

Subject: Free Northstar Advantage

Speaking of sorry cries from western Massachusetts, I got a call last
weekend from a guy in Stockbridge who wants to find a good home for a
Northstar Advantage.  He said that Jay Sage had given him my name.  I 
have no interest in this particular machine (my wife has been making
comments about the corpses *already* cluttering the house :-), but
someone here might.

For those unfamiliar with it, the Advantage is an integrated CP/M
machine (CPU, CRT and drives in same case, like a Superbrain).  This
particular machine was having trouble with its drive B before the
high-voltage power supply failed.  The owner thinks the latter problem
merely requires a fuse replacement, but it isn't worth it to him to fix
it (he does his serious work on another unidentified CP/M box).  The
machine requires hard-sector diskettes, which he claims can still be
obtained from Lyben.  He bought some recently, and I believe he plans
to include them with the machine.

The machine is in Stockbridge, but the owner indicated that his son
could bring it into Boston.  If you're interested, call Gordon Northrop
at 413-298-3194.

Thanks for the responses.  I smoked my workstation monitor, so I'm a little
behind in my mail.

Ummm, some 5.25" drives don't even have a Drive Ready signal.  For example, the
SA400, SA450 and SA455.  Many of the 5.25" 1.2Mb drives give you a jumper to
select between Drive Ready and Disk Change.  Even so, my understanding of the
Drive Ready signal (and experimentation with it too) is that the signal works
differently than it does for a 8" drive.  I have the information on the 8"
drive, but do not exactly know how the 5.25" drives with this signal work.
I'll have to find out.

First, I still see no problem with the AND gate.  The real problem your
discussing is with the Drive Ready Signal.  To make things work, I had tied the
controllers Drive Ready signal to ground.  While it seems to work (and has
seemed to work for others), I would still agree that this is BAD.

Second, I did try to tie the Motor On Signal to ground.  I don't remember what
happened now, but I do remember that it did not seem a good solution.

Now your talking.  As having a working Drive Ready Signal makes the whole
system more reliable, this (hardware) is probably the path I will take.

The problem is that there is no Motor On signal on most 8" interface
connectors.  Since the motor is AC, and always on, there was no need for the
signal.  In any case, I have not been able to find such a jumper on the Epson
or Chinon 1.2Mb floppies that I have.  The Shugart drives (and I think the TEAC
drives) do have this jumper.

The problem is that this jumper may have disapeared on newer drives, since most
of these drives are going into PC's, and other computers that provide the Motor
On signal.  Someone mentioned that on some drives, the Drive Select 2 (or DS1
depending on whether it starts for 1 or 0) jumper was soldered in.  The Chinon
drive have the termination resistor soldered in, but there is a jumper labeled
TM, which I think disables the resister pack.

----------

In any case, I am going to again try to jumper the Motor On to ground (on my
new Chinon drives).  I'll also start working on a delay circuit for the Drive
Ready signal.  I suspect that the delay can be quite a bit less than 1 to 2
seconds though.  Main problem will be in making sure I don't add noise to the
interface.

Message-ID: <"22-Feb-91 12:13:59 EST".*.Michael_D._Sprague.wbst311@Xerox.com>

Some of you will remember the trouble I had installing ZSDOS on my Xerox
820-II, specifically all the trouble I had with MOVCPM.

I think I finally have it installed.  Thanks to an old issue of The Computer
Journal, I found that SYSGEN could create an absolute model of your system.
While my CP/M manual doesn't say anything about it, an old book on CP/M did.
You need to do a SYSGEN/SAVE combination.  It was NOT obvious how many memory
pages I needed to SAVE (even though the book thought it was).  I checked the
size of the file MOVCPM had created for my 60k system, and found it to be about
the same size as that shown in the books 54k example.  I did a SAVE 41 to
SYSTEM.MDL.

I then used INSTALOS in the absolute mode, and loaded in the file I had created
with the SYSGEN/SAVE combination.  This time, the BDOS, CCP, and BIOS were
about where I expected them to be.  I replaced the BDOS with ZSDOS, and then
saved the file.

I then used it to SYSGEN a new disk, and had no trouble booting up and using
the disk.  While I still have a little bit of work ahead of me to make sure it
really worked, so far it seems to.  It's nice not having to press Control-C
whenever I change disks in the B drive!!  Of course some of the other features
are far more useful, but that was the first one I noticed.

Next step, ZCPR!

I stand corrected.  The manual for the SA 455/465 says that is does indeed have
a READY signal.  In additon, the manual states that it takes 500 mS for the
drive motor to come up to speed.  READY becomes active 700 mS after the MOTOR
ON signal is generated (assuming all other signals are correct).  It stands to
reason that modern drives are at least as fast as the older SA 455/465, but
still a delay of 500 to 700 mS is in order, just to play it safe.

Better yet if I can use the drives READY signal.  Turns out that it's the 5.25"
READY signal I understand, not the 8".  I poked around with a logic probe this
morning, but didn't find anything out.  I suspect I'll need to have the drive
in a working system, with Drive Select active to find anything out.  I'll let
you all know what I find out.

Last, I think I found the jumper to connect Motor On with Drive Select on the
Chinon drives.  On the 360kb drive (which you can get for $49), you need to
remove the metal shield, and solder a jumper (no jumper pins here) onto J4.  It
is labeled on the circuit board, and has a box around it.  I know have a pair
of them running on my Xerox 820-II.

On the Chinon 1.2Mb drives ($59) I found one of the jumper blocks to be labeled
MS.  As the pins are jumpered together, I assume that if the jumper is
unplugged, then Drive Select and Motor On will be tied together.  I have yet to
test this out though.

I am interested in hearing more from those of you who have or are trying to
replace 8" drives with 3.5" drives.

Enjoy!

**** DON'T DO THIS !!!! ****
Most newer 5/25" or 3/5" drives do not onload the head when the drive is not
being access.  If you leave the drive running continuously, you will wear
out the diskette at an alarming rate.  I have several souvenier diskettes
where nearly all the magnetic oxide has been worn off the diskette from
being left in drives that were running continuously.  You could practically
read a newspaper through one of them.

If you can't do it properly with a real motor control, then either a) tie
motor-on to the drive-select and always delay 1/2 second after selecting
before accessing drive, or b) build a small timer that will pull down the
motor on line for 20-60 seconds after a select.

Computers and human beings should not share the same room when either is

Subject: Z system resources
Message-ID: <m0jA4PL-00004QC@jartel.info.com>

As Jay Sage said, the Z system is too big a subject to explain here, but
one point seems worth making:
 
The Z system uses a standard CP/M BIOS - whatever the BIOS can handle,
(eg. bank switching) that the Z system will use.  The auto-install versions
don't need access to the BIOS source, but as the Z system uses a few K *above*
the BIOS for buffers and command packages, I personally would find it easier
to install a system manually with BIOS source available.
 
Some resources are:
 
"ZCPR3: The Manual" by Richard Conn, published by New York Zoetrope in 1985,
ISBN 0-918432-59-6.  It deals with version 3.0, and so is now a bit outdated.
Jay Sage (again!) may have better documentation on the more recent
developments in the Z system.  The system itself had ~500K of help files
when I last looked, and will have more by now. 
 
The most current list of Z-nodes that I have is below:
 
======================================================================

This list includes information about accessing the Z-Nodes using the two
low-cost data services, PC-Pursuit (PCP) and StarLink (SL).  For nodes
accessible by PCP, the city code and maximum data rate are given.  Where
known, the SL code is given.  An asterisk with the code indicates that the
call to the Z-Node may incur local toll charges.  If you know the SL code
for any nodes that do not have a code listed, I would appreciate it

We are especially happy to welcome with this listing two new Z-Nodes:
Larry Moore's node 13 in Fergus, Ontario, and John Anderson's node 16 in

Hi-

I'd like to get ahold of the CP/M utilities disk for which there is a card i
the C128 system guide.  Unfortunately, my card seems to be missing.  I'm
wondering: is there anyone who is selling there C128 system, or who doesn't
use C128 CP/M, who has these utilities disks (including MAC and RMAC) who
would be willing to part with them?

thanks,

I was thumbing through the Global Computer Supplies catalog this
evening (Saturday evening is slow without Twin Peaks :-), and noticed
that they carry 5.25" hard-sector (useful for that Advantage I
mentioned the other day) and 8" floppies from Verbatim, 3M and Maxell.
I've never done business with them, but they *have* been around a
while.  Their customer service number is 800-227-1246.   Their order

Craig Hagan recently asked the following questions:

>> 2) are there any pascal or c compilers out there that i could run and if
>> so, how much would it cost for me to purchase them.

As others answered for me, my wife's company has Turbo Pascal ($60) and BDS C
($60 for a limited version, $90 for the full package, which I recommend over
the limited one).

However, these are not the only routes.  If you just want to dabble a bit
without (or before) spending any money, there are public-domain compilers
available.  For Pascal, you can get the old JRT Pascal, which was released
when the company went out of business.  This package is no where near the
quality of Turbo Pascal (probably why JRT went out of business), but it is
quite usable -- in fact, I used it on some major projects before Turbo came
along.

There are also some public-domain implementations of C, notably SMALL-C.  I
am not a C programmer, so others will have to supply details on this.

>> what do people recommend for a 2 drive system for shareware software
>> (remember its a Morrow, not a kaypro, etc) the cpu is a 4mhz Z80

What is that crack about "it's a Morrow, not a Kaypro?"  The Morrow, like the
Kaypro, is a very fine machine.  Its terminal is different, so software has
to be configured for it, but that is generally not a big problem.  Most CP/M
computers in use today have 4 MHz Z80s.  I think you have a nicer machine
there than you realize!!

>> point of interest: are there any benchmark programs out there (preferably
>> in z80 assembly to give it its best showing) i am curious.

Bridger Mitchell wrote what is currently the state of the art in sieve
programs.  I know it is posted on my Z-Node, and it is probably on Simtel20,
but I cannot remember its name just now.  Sorry.  Something like JSIEVE or
ZSIEVE, perhaps.  If you really want to know and no one else can supply the
answer, I can fetch it off the Z-Node.

Yes, and I think that is why quite a few of us have stuck with CP/M.  The
hardware may not be as powerful as with some other machines, but the user
community has a different ethic.

I strongly second this comment.  The Z-System does not include a new BIOS; it
builds on the existing BIOS.  It can add features (cf. especially my next TCJ
column), but it never subtracts features.

Will then added:

This comment I do not understand!  True, the Z-System must have some modules
installed in protected memory (above or within the BIOS), but this is the
case whether the system is installed manually or automatically.  The
automatic system uses a trick whose only penalty is a small amount of extra
memory usage (about 0.25K).

In no case is the manual system "easier to install", no matter whether you
have BIOS source or not.  The real limitation of a manual system is that it
is highly inflexible: whatever buffers you have built in, that's what you are
stuck with.  With the automatic system you can change the total amount of
memory used by the buffers, as well as how that memory is partitioned among
them, at any time, even right in the middle of a multiple command line
sequence.

The ability to add and remove BIOS features by exchanging virtual BIOS
(VBIOS) modules is also lost in a manual system.  In principle -- though so
far I have yet to get around to doing this on my Ampro -- one can have a
SMALLER operating system (larger TPA) with NZCOM than with a standard BIOS
installation.  One simply strips all the bells and whistles out of the CBIOS
and includes them in the virtual BIOS.  Then, when one runs an application
that is really memory hungry, one can swap in the minimum VBIOS.

By the way, not having source to the BIOS does not absolutely preclude a
manual installation.  Several installation packages have been published for
ZCPR30, and they can easily be updated for ZCPR33.  You pretty much do need a
working MOVCPM so that you can move the system down to make room above the
BIOS for the Z-System buffers.  Then you have to patch the coldboot code to
initialize those buffers.  I have done that without having any source code. 
The coldboot routines are usually pretty simple and standard, and you can
generally patch in right at the beginning anyway.  Just put the
initialization code up in high memory and have it jump to the original
coldboot code.  If anyone wants more hints on this approach, just ask.  At
one time I had this reduced to a fine art, but now I use nothing but
autoinstall systems, and so I have not thought about these details for
several years.  But if you insist, I am willing to try!

Will mentions Rick Conn's book as a resource.  Sage Microsystems has them in
stock ($20).  Will is quite right that much of the material is rather dated,
but I still find myself referring to it amazingly often.  Another resource,
especially for those doing a manual installation of ZCPR33 is my own book
(pamphlet?) called "The ZCPR33 Users Guide" ($15).  It describes the
significant new features introduced with version 3.3 of ZCPR and has a lot of
material on how to perform the installation.

Mike Sprague described how he finally overcame the obstacles to getting ZDOS
installed on his machine, including all the operations with MOVCPM and SYSGEN
(bravo, and congratulations, Mike).  Then he concluded with "Next step,
ZCPR!"  I just want to remind people again that if you do things the other
way around, an NZCOM Z-System first, then installing ZSDOS is just about
trivial.  Putting the clock-driver module into the NZCOM user buffer is one
of the options on the clock-driver generator's menu, and loading the DOS is
as simple as issuing the command: JETLDR ZSDOS.ZRL.

   Ummm, well, ZMP does both uploads and downloads. At least it did when I
wrote it: but, then, considering that nobody ever does any uploads it's
possible that that part has withered away. Call it evolution in action.

   There are lots of PD assemblers which would probably assemble the overlay
for you, although you may have to tweak it a bit. I can't remember them
offhand, but they're probably on simtel-20 and lots of other places as well.
E-mail me if you're still having problems.

I've been using an Apple II+ with Applicard and Zip Chip - no troubles
to date.  It DOES tend to get hot, though - so a nice bit of cooling
is in order, especially for the Zip Chip.

As an aside, can someone tell me if there are any other hard drives
you can use with a PCPI card besides the Sider?  Ones that work with
Prodos?  What about SCSI?

If you have an Northstar Advantage model III, 
on the cpu card there are 9 positions for 16 pin dips. if you stuff these
with 150ns 64k dram, and put .47uf bypass caps beside them, you can
access the memory via the memory management registers. this gives
you 128k of ram, just enough for cpm3.

i'm in the middle of a cpm3 port, bios to be posted here.  This may
take a while, since the disk controller is so bloody stupid.

. Does anybody know how to get the Advantage to read soft sector?
  the 8-16 msdos does it, very slowly.

. Does anybody have bios source?

. Has anybody seen a ms-dos greater than version 1.25 for this beast?

. how about source to io.sys?? drool.

Message-ID: <1991Feb25.175742.1741@imada.dk>

Some time ago somebody asked about how to recreate the contents of a
compacted file.  There is various methods which is all supported by
numerous utility programs, that are all very well written.

Among these I stumbeled over a mailserver with some very interesting
programs on it, one of these being EXL which is written by David P.
Goodenough.

The original description follows...


----- cut here ----- part 1 ----- cut here -----
/send help sends help for rna
/send index sends a list of available files

[descriptions left out]

exl:	  A program to type squeezed (.?Q?), crunched (.?Z?), and LZH
	  compressed (.?Y?) files. It can also type from a .LBR library
	  file, either an uncompressed member, or one compressed as above;
	  and it can also send output to the printer, and extract single
	  files to disk. This is a preliminary release, but it may prove
	  useful for unwrapping .?Y? files. The final version will include
	  a filesweep mode for uncompressing multiple files either on disk,
	  or extracting multiple files from a .LBR
	  Written by David P. Goodenough, Current version *preliminary*

[more descriptions left out]

----- cut here ----- end of part 1 ----- cut here -----

I do not know if a later version has been released but I have used this
*preliminary version* since about early autum, and found it VERY handy.
You can actually "TYPE" a crunched text file within a library with one
command.

Unfortunately, the errormessages are not always very descriptive, which
once in a while is a bit confusing.

If anyone is interested you can send a letter to

   rna@harlie.lonestar.org

with ONE line in it saying

   "/send help"  or "/send exl" 

but it may take some time.  Otherwise, e-mail me, and I will send you my
copy (uudecoded).

ZCPR is a replacement for the CP/M CCP which provides a variety of 
improvements such as a command search path, named directories, a very open
user area structure, command aliases (substitute small commands for big ones 
or groups of commands), multiple commands on a command line, standard CP/M 
terminal interface, if, else, endif structure in batch command processing 
and much MUCH more.  You can download vs. 3.3 from my bbs listed below, or
from any of the Znodes around the country.  Znode 3 is one of the primary
sources for ZCPR and related software.  The number is 617-965-7259.  Zcpr 
3.4 is a commercial product ($70) but well worth the investment since it 
saves the considerable time and frustration of assembling all the elements
of ZCPR 3.3.  There is also a magazine called The Computer Journal which
has lots of excellent articles on ZCPR and CP/M.  Subscription is $18 a year 
and may be obtained from TCJ, P.O. Box 12, S. Plainfield, NJ  07080-0012. 
Info on TCJ and on ZCPR34 is extensively available on Znode 3, the number of 
which is above.

	Greetings. I beg to differ. The copy of ZCPR 3.3 that is currently

	included both sources and ready .COM files. I had to mess around

	If you want to download from simtel, ftp to "simtel20.army.mil"
	at OFF PEAK hours - like 2 AM EST ;-) - and do this:

	login: anonymous

	> cd pd2:<cpm.kaypro>
	> hash
	> tenex
	> get k10z33.lbr 		[for a Kaypro 10]

	Transfer this to your Kaypro and un-LBR it and read the READ.ME
	and *.DOC files. It took me 25 min to install ZCPR 3.3.

	Take care.

I have it, at least the Z80 version, and it is quite good.  The 180 
version is for the SB180, but might work on a generic 180 or 280.
 
If you want to buy it, let me know.  $75.
 
I don't have the manual any more, but any good Modula-2 manual should 
work.

Howdee:

I was indirectly responsible for that booboo.  You see, CUG only sent me 2 of
the 4 disks in the CUG292 volume; that was before X-mas.  Well I've since 
received a new batch, and have put them into our local FTP site!

You may get the 500-600K .zoo file from SAL.SAIT.EDU.AU in the public
sources area.  It is PD and will let you assemble code for heaps of
micros; especially those from Motorola.  One thing...  I got these on
Kaypro disks and in order to .zoo them I moved them to a PC with Sydex
22disk.  Some one already told me they had garbage at the end of each
file; so if this is true, let me know & I'll .ARK them or something else.

I tested it, and it isn't.

Upon taking the metal shield cover off, I discovered that the jumper was MS1
not MS.  There was also a jumper for MS2.  From this I assume that the jumpers
are really for setting the disk speed either to single speed (MS1) our dual
speed (MS2).

I attempted to follow the MOTOR ON trace on the circuit board (which is how I
found the correct jumper on the 360K drives), but had no luck in finding any
jumper to set the MOTOR ON signal to the DRIVE SELECT signal.  Ah well, back to
the AND gate solution.

I did tie MOTOR ON to ground.  As expected, the motors spun all the time, and
the head stayed loaded.  In additon, I set the jumper that selects between Disk
Ready and Disk Change to the Disk Ready setting.  I connected pin 36 (now Disk
Ready) to the READY line on the 8" interface, and it seemed to work fine.
However I do not know if this will work under normal operation when the motor
has to spin up.

John,
 
   I must admit I don't know what PacPerson is but am always interested 
in new CP/M software. I am running a Osborne 1 which emulates a TV-920 
for screen codes so I might be able to use it right out of the box from 
what you said. I would be glad to upload it to the CP/M boards in the 
Houston, Tx area if you would be so kind as to send me a copy to the 
address below. Thanks Much. Hope to hear from you.

  David,
  sorry I had to post here, but my mailer doesn't like 'rat@ruth.uucp'
  
  Do you notice any performance increase?  I am particularly interested in
  character I/O.   Is character loss over the serial port reduced/eliminated?
  
  This was the main thrust behind my original questions.
  
  Alhough I expect to be getting a CardZ180 in the next few weeks (if Jim Lill
  can ever get it sent off), and will have solved the character loss problem
  that way, I believe that much could be gained by having the 6502 side of the
  OS run as FAST as possible.
  
  What do you think?  That is, what has been your experience, since you run
  an accelerated 6502 with your AppliCard.
  
  Thanks.

  Yes, I put together an overlay for ZMP v1.5 on PCPI Apples.

In his message of 25 Feb 91 17:57:42 GMT, ravn@imada.dk (Thorbjoern Ravn Andersen) states:

[...]
>/send help sends help for rna
>/send index sends a list of available files

  This is not quite the format of the commands to give to the server.
  The "/send" line also must include a destination address.

  The correct format is:

       /send help to your-address-here

            - and -

       /send index to your-address-here

Note that addresses are checked before files are sent out, so mistakes
are usually caught and redirected to the proper destination.

David Goodenough is actively adding to his library of CPM utilities,
so expect more programs to appear as time goes by.

Ron,
 
  I was wondering if you received the Osborne 1 overlay for ZMP that I 
forwarded on thru Fred in Calif. yet? If you didn't get it I will be 
glad to send it straight to you by mail. I still have your address so 
just let me know whether you received it or not. Klaus Schauer did a 
good job on it and it worked real well with my Osborne. Hope to hear 
back from you. I enjoy your comm program. Thanks ..

Subject: Z sys and compilers
Message-ID: <m0jBKnx-0000E8C@jartel.info.com>

To clarify, when I said that it was easier to install the Z system 
manually with BIOS source, I was making the comparison with manula
installation without BIOS source.  In all cases, automatic installation
will be easier.

I recently came across a firm selling C compilers with source for 
a number of microprocessors: 8080, 8086, 6809 among them. They make
a feature of portability, and also sell a number of cross assemblers.
Their prices are in the $20-$50 range; I imagine you get what you pay
for.  (Their compilers are *not* derived from the standard Small-C
series).  I've never bought anything from them, nor do I know anyone
who has, but their address is:

  Nepean, Ontario, Canada

Hope this helps - Will
