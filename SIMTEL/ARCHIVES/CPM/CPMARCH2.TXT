Hi all!

I recall seeing some talk about building a SCSI port for my CP/M machine
and that it was in a magazine called (The) Computer Journal...
My library has "The Computer Journal" but it's mostly math and such; no
tech stuff, is there a magazine titled "Computer Journal"?

Any help on the subject would be most apreciated.

Thanks in advance.

This is taken from the CP/M virus I wrote, but never released:

        sub     a
        jp      pe,notz80        ; test for 8080

The trick is that on an 8080 the parity is even (A is zero) which SETS
the P/V flag, and on a Z80 there has been no overflow, so the flag is
clear.

Hello,

Does anyone on this list know of a way to print a screen on a
Kaypro II?  I would like to be able to dump a screen to the
printer while using communications software.

One alternative would be to save the screens and print them later.
I have a program called TOON which is supposed to save screens to
a disk file, but the machine locks up when I try to use TOON with
communications software.

I have a TPC I, which is almost the same machine as the 803, but has only one
serial port.  The manual has a little information about the STI chip, which
is a Mostek 3801.  There is an IMP overlay available for it, but I haven't
seen one for ZMP.  David Goodenough wrote Qterm for this machine, so with
that program you don't need an overlay.

Most of the CP/M manuals refer to
 
Control Program for Microprocessors
 
Although it is said that Gary Kildall can no longer remember what
he called it originally.

Here' the definitive word, from a book entitled "CP/M Software Finder",
copublished by Que and DR., on p. 18:

"CP/M is the idea of Dr. Gary Kildall, founder and Chief Executive Officer
of Digital Research Inc.  Originated in the mid-1970s when punched paper
tape was the standard method of storage, CP/M was created to ease the burden
of program development.  The abbreviation CP/M stands for Control Program
for Microcomputers"

Hello,

I am going to be using a Cromemco 68000 based S100 system for some work.
What I need is boot code that I can feed into the Z80 to bring the 68K
online.  This is one of those beasts where the Z80 kickstarts the 68000.
I can talk to the IO Processor Z80 and the Boot monitor (RDOS) Z80.

If someone could mail me a little piece of code that I can enter to make
the switch from running on the Z80 to the 68K it would be greatly
appreciated.  If anyone has some of the old O/S disks for this, I could
possibly work my way back from there.

Thanks Much!!

Sorry if this is not the correct forum for this post but here goes.
A church in Modesto, CA recently received a donation of some kind of CP/M
system.  I can't remember the make or model but it had an S-100 bus, with
about 8 processor boards for 8 users.  The thing wants to work but the
hard disk has gone south.  Does anyone out there want or know of anyone
who might want this system?  The church will accept any offer.  Interested
parties may e-mail me.

I guess there is another journal with the same name!  The one you are
interested in is:

You won't find it on any newsstands, and you won't find it in very many
libraries.  But you could subscribe and order back issues, including the
ones on SCSI interfaces.  TCJ needs the support of the community if it is

- According to The CP/M Bible (Waite & Angermeyer, H.W. Sams & Co) it means
- "Control Program for Microprocessors".  DR, in their official manual, does
- not explain the acronym.
- 

   Sure it does.  On Page 223 of the Digital Research CP/M manual,
(Appendix H: Glossary) CP/M is defined as:

"CP/M: Control Program for Microcomputers.  An operating system that manages
 computer resources and provides a standard systems interface to software
 written for a large variety of microprocessor-based computer systems."

Greetings,

I have a TeleVideo TS-802H with a dead hard disk.  In that I don't really need
hard disk in the setting that it is used in, I had thought about adding a
second floppy drive to it and dumping the hd into the scrap box.

I did the obvious, i.e. remove the hd and put in the floppy with the resistor
pak removed, the cable with the twist, and the addresses set for the drive, but
alas.. no boot (message-- HDD error, contact distributor.)

Right on, it's in ROM--
Called TeleVideo, found that noone supports OLD (venerable) machines there.

I obviously need to blow a new prom, pull out the HDD controller and (daughter
board?) to get it going again.

Anyone with assistance, or a PROM listing?

I would really hate to throw away a good machine because the HD failed.

Message-ID: <OBLIVION.93Feb5114933@spica.bu.edu>

Greetings CP/M users...

I was a bit suprised that there was still a CP/M community on the
Internet, Nevertheless, I am greatful.  My question before the group
concerns a People Machine made by Olympia.  It is a 4 user 8086
machine which runs both Concurrent CP/M and MS-DOS 3.3.  When I
obtained the machine, it was supplied with only one BOOT disk, (it
boots into CCP/M-86) with no command to format a disk and transfer the
two boot tracks in order to make another bootable floppy.  The Boot
disk I have now looks like it has been used for approx. three to four
years due to the physical wear on the floppy media.. (caused by the
heads constantly scrapping across the surface of the disk.  I don't
know why but this system does have a Hard Disk but It is not bootable.
It is setup so that I MUST boot off of the Floppy.  I tried every
command possible in all the directories to fine one to create a new
GENSYS file (like in MP/M but CCP/M is much different.)

I also found out that I can not read CP/M 2.2 disks in this machine.
(I also have an ALTOS series 5 which runs MP/M 2.0)  The machines are
completely in compatible.  Which is a bummer.  I expect that I am
going to have to write my own utility to read and copy the two boot

THis may be in a FAQ(is this group large enough for one?), but could
someone list any available User groups/ SIGs/ ftp sites/ bbs's that

pretty funky windowing environment.

Subject: DHNS Status
Message-ID: <1381@pacs.pha.pa.us>

For those wondering about the status of Drexel Hill North Star BBS,
(215)-623-4040, here are some messages left by Sysop Bob Dean on Jay Sage's BBS.

MSG 282 is 12 line(s) on 01/29/93 from BOB DEAN
to ALL about DHN* UPDATE

After a three-month hiatus, DHN* will be returning online inside of
two or so weeks with a new 213 Mb hard drive.  This is thanks to 
any number of people who felt there is still a need for its services
as a major archive of CPM and Z-System software (including your host
sysop here, and the PACS CP/M group which contributed its entire
treasury).  Restoration will be undertaken in stages, since so many
files are involved.  The message base and software will start from
scratch, as the old one was lost.  Thanks go to those who came to
the rescue in its time of need (again!), more info as it becomes news.

Sysop, DHN*  215-623-4040


Msg 288 is 14 line(s) on 02/04/93 from BOB DEAN
to ALL about DHN*/AMPRO/BIG DRIVE

It appears that DHN*'s Ampro will handle about 210 Mb online at a time.
TPA is streched to the max (min) at about 44.50k or so, so the message
base/BBS software will be dictated by what runs at that level (PBBS
or, perhaps HBBS).  The limitation using the stock Ampro bios is now
number of directory entries at 1024 per logical drive (I set at 10
logical drives of 20 Mb each!).  Reloading is tedious of about 110
720k flops (excl Royal Oak material), as the tape backup is no good.
All of 1992 files were lost (about 15-20 Mb), so that will require
rebuilding.  However, I expect that can be sourced from other current
Z-Nodes.  Hardware and new 3/4 tower enclosure appears to be stable,
though one casualty was its 720k 5 1/4", which was replaced with one
temporarily pirated from "Great Kate", disk conversion machine (anyone
have a Teac 55FV gathering dust?).  Treasury was reduced to zero but
it still looks like in about 2 weeks DHN* will be back on track.

I have a fully operational Nortstar Advantage with

loaded on the harddisk including WordStar 3.0, dBase II 2.4
BDS C compiler, and misc. other stuff.

Anyone interested?

I also have an IMSAI 8080 chassis with misc boards.
I don't have any software for it, but I have been

Anyone?

The third card is a Titan MSDOS card.  Depending on the ROM chip and
the revision level of the card it may be a MSDOS emulator (well,
actually the 8088 takes over the whole system, and the Z80 just does
I/O.  I don't know if it will still talk to the HD) and a Ramdisk under
CP/M.  You need the card, it's boot ROM, and the boot floppy to be all
the same vintage for it to work.  The most recent version is 3.0, and
Titan are (used to be) at:
    Titan Technologies
    310 W Ann Street,
    PO Box 8050
    Ann Arbor
    MI 48107    (313) 662-7777
If you can't find them, let me know the revision number on the top
of the ROM (Titan will want this too) and I'll see what I can do.
Versions 1 and 2 used 64KB chips, as far as I can recall, and could
stack up to two memory cards on the cpu card.  Version 3.0 used 256KB
chips, and had only one memory card.  So if there are pins out the top
of the connector, it's version 1 or 2.  (In which case throw it away,
its more trouble than it's worth.  3.0 is barely useful, these days).

I don't think I ever found the solution to this one, tho' I prodded around
inside ws.com with DDT.  If you follow the initial boot sequence of ws,
you *may* find a jump or call to an initialisation routine which if 
replaced by a simple RET stops WS messing with the disk.  But it's a long
time ago, and I replace the Epson WS with a standard version pretty
quickly.  The Epson version is missing a lot of the standard configuration
code, since it is supposed to run only on a QX10.

All virus-infected programs have to be executed before they can infect 
your system, whether they are for MSDOS or CP/M.

The virus was very simple. It could only infect CP/M Plus systems 
(because they have the ability to turn off BDOS error messages) which 
were using Z80s (because I needed the Jump Relative instruction to keep 
the code as position independant as possible). It also checked for there 
being sufficient memory free for its DMA sector buffer.

It copied the first eight bytes from the start of a COM file, placed 
it within the virus code at the end of the COM file, and replaced these 
with a jump to the virus code and an ID of 'GOON'. The virus would 
infect the first COM file it found in the same drive/user area and set 
something so that file wouldn't be touched again.

Every 10 usages of an infected program, it would print "I've been 
sponned" and drop back to the CCP prompt.

A .COM file would grow by three sectors (3x128 bytes) after infection.

Before you ask, I'm not willing to release the full source to anyone. I 
am not going to be held responsible by people for allowing other idiots 
to write programs to crash their computers or wipe their disks.

You can get a shareware program from Sydex called ANADISK which will allow
you to do a track by track copy of a CP/M disk on a MSDOS machine.  Contact
the Sydex BBS at 503-683-1385.

Does the hard drive work properly otherwise?  If not, then the BIOS is 
probably forcing a boot from your floppy.

CP/M system are infamous for having incompatible floppy formats between
manufacturers.  The Altos has a 96tpi format.  What's the spec on the
Olympia.  You may be able to move stuff between machines using 22DISK, also
from Sydex to force your Olympia in MS-DOS mode to write the CP/M format for
the ALTOS.

SIMTEL20 and it's mirror sites have extensive archives of CP/M files.

6.2000 is not exactly representable in 32 bit floating point. 6.199999 has the
same representation as the closest approximation to 6.2
. It depends on number of significant digits you asked for
whether it will be rounded to 6.2 or printed as 6.19999...

This is not a failure of the Aztec software, just the facts of real numbers
vs. floating point representations.

It's an outside possiblity that you can use another hd.  Replacing the HD
with an MFM drive whose drive geometry parameters equal or exceed those of
the existing HD may allow you to continue to use the machine at the expense
of using only part of a good hard drive.  You'll have to be able to boot and
format from a floppy drive.

All my reference materials *also* describe CP/M as "Control Program for 
Microprocessors." However, my instincts tell me that "Control 
Program/Monitor" is the true description. Why else the "slash?"
 
Is Gary Kildall still "out there?" I suspect that only he can provide an 
absolute pronouncement in this matter.  :)
 
(OOPS! Just found a reference that describes CP/M as "Control Program for 
Microcomputers." Just when you thought you were making progress...)
 
Perhaps we should just truncate the operating system's to "CP?" It seems 
that *all* versions agree with "Control Program."  ;)

Quite right, it is dipswitch 2 position 6 (S2-6):  Up for HD boot, down for 
floppy boot.  Also note that position 4 of S2 selects between 10mb and 20mb
HD capability.  Up selects 20mb, down selects 10mb.

At the price of used 20mb disks these days, installing one of them would be
the obvious choice to me.

Check out MEX.  Contact sage@ll.mit.edu (Jay Sage) who doubtless has all the
pd sources on his BBS.  You'll need to do some overlay work to fit the
program to your computer and modem, but after that, it's quite
user-friendly.

May I seriously suggest that you consider something else?

The Z80 addresses a linear address space of 64K. That's it.

If you want more, you've got to bank switch. And you've got to build the 
hardware to bank switch yourself (all right, it's not that difficult, 
but there are easier ways).

If you want Z80 compabible code, consider either the Z180 (which I think 
will address that much, as linear address space), or the Z280 (which is 
a 16 bit chip) and almost certainly will address that much.

MyZ80 is a very good Z80 emulator, current version is 1.03.  But it's 
still got that 64K limit...

Well, all of the files in the library of UUCP on Wuarchive are in a strange 
compression format.  All of the files have the extention with the middle
letter being Y.  For instance:  CCICO.CYM, RMAIL.CYM, SMAIL.SYM, UUCP.DYC,
QTCHAT.DYC, etc.  The only one that is not like this is SETDRV.COM and that
just warm boots my Kaypro 4.  I would really like to get this running on
this machine and I am stumped.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Subject: Interrupts during a BDOS call
Message-ID: <TORBJAR.93Feb10094950@cert17.ce.chalmers.se>

This is obviously implementation dependendent, but...

I'm working on a simple program to copy RTTY.  It works nicely
printing to the console and I decided to try to have it save the
output to a disk file.  Since the diskette drive is a "slow"
device, especially if it has to be started, the program was
changed from polling the Z80 SIO to using interrupts and two 128
byte buffers.  The non-interrupt level loop writes out a full
buffer while the interrupt handler continues to fill the other.

This works well if the write-to-disk is simulated by
print-to-console-at-300-baud, but the system locks up when the
write sequential BDOS call is used.  Everything works if I
terminate the program before the third WRSEQ call (which actually
performs physical I/O): in this case I reset the SIO (disable
receiver and interrupts), calls WRSEQ and CLOSE and have 1, 2 or
3 128 byte blocks in the file (the last is partially filled).
Putting a di/ei pair around the call to WRSEQ make no (visible)
difference.

Keyboard input in general works correctly during diskette I/O
(like type ahead after exiting an editor), but sometimes loses
the first one or two characters.

The system is a Z80 CPU with two SIOs and a DMA that is required
by the FDC.  Non-hardware system documentation from the vendor is
not available (the system is from '84; I've had it for about a
month).  I have started to disassemble the code for write
sequential in hope to find something to explain the behaviour.
Maybe the DMA/FDC combination doesn't tolerate interrupts during
transfers unless some conventions (which console I/O know about)
are followed.

So the question is, is there anything that generally says that
this shouldn't be possible with CP/M?  Has anyone done this on
a CP/M system?  Any hints or information?

Subject: Micro Emacs...  anybody remember it?
Message-ID: <1993Feb9.233117.15025@imada.ou.dk>

About a year ago, I remember seeing somebody talking about an Emacs port
for CP/M (flavour unknown).  I would very much appreciate getting
pointers towards such a beast, as somehow one gets addicted when using
GNU Emacs at a fast Sun machine.

It doesn't matter whether the commandset is very limited.  A very big
boon would be an UNDO.

If you don't know such a beast, but knows a site which archives
comp.os.cpm, that would be great as well (then I will search for it
myself).

Thanks in advance.

Can you send any more information such as make/model, is the harddisk MFM or
IDE or SCSII, how much documentation/boot disks are there.  Multiprocessor
Z80 systems generally had one master and several slave CPU's, or does this
system have something else?

You need a program like ucrlzh??.com to uncrunch files compressed into
filename.?Y? format. It's an advanced (for CP/M, anyway) version of
crunch.

Actually, there is a Fidonet echomail area called "CPMTECH" on the US 
backbone, which tends to be more active than comp.os.cpm. You might like 
to try that first. Many people posting in here also read that echo.

Once upon a time I had a customer who wanted to receive data into the
serial port on a Teletek Systemaster S-100 board at 9600 BAUD and write
it out to the floppy disk for later processing.  He had run into problems
and created a test program to help isolate the problem.  His test program
used the Z80-CTC to generate periodic interrupts in the background while
in the foreground he did BDOS disk I/O.  The catch was the CTC interrupt
routine varied a delay count so that the ISR took longer and longer to
execute.  This test program would hang the system everytime... but in
a slightly different place everytime.

After looking and looking at this problem and trying several potential
fixes I finally found the magic potion to solve the problem.

Note that this particular H/W used the NEC 765 FDC.  This FDC has
the "special" feature that once you start a disk read/write it keeps
going and going and going until given a stop command.  Another piece
of the puzzle was that the FDC was kludged into the Z80 interrupt daisy
chain *at the end*.  When an intack occurred with IEO from the daisy
chain false the data bus was assumed to be driven by some Z80 peripheral
chip (DMA, SIO, or CTC).  If IEO was true then bit 0 of the data bus was
zeroed while the rest floated providing an 0xFE vector for the FDC.

So what would happen is that we would get into the CTC ISR and hang out.
Meanwhile the DMA would interrupt to complete the disk data transfer.
Since we were already servicing an ISR the DMA interrupt was left for
later.  Later when the floppy disk rotated far enough the FDC started
reading/writing the next sector.  But of course the DMA was done so there
was nobody to take/give data and the FDC puked with a data over/under-run.

To fix this we had to:
A) modify the H/W to mask the FDC interrupt if any Z80 peripherals were
   "interrupt-active" using a spare 'and' gate (previously the int line
   from the 765 FDC was direct-connected to the Z80 interrupt input).
B) modify the CTC ISR to allow nested interrupts.
C) modify the DMA ISR to issue the terminal count to the 765 FDC and stop
   the floppy data transfer.

The bottom line is that you are trying to do something pretty advanced
for CP/M and many of these systems weren't up to this type of thing in
box stock form.  Without source code for the BIOS you are going to have
a very difficult time finding the problem.  Maybe this has given you
some ideas on where to look and how to proceed.

I can remember two of them.  One is Mark of the Unicorn's MINCE (Mince
Is Not Complete Emacs); the other is the editor that came with Perfect
Writer (as shipped with Kaypro systems).

I don't believe either has an UNDO feature (at least, I don't think
it's bound to C-_).  Even if they do (and I've missed or forgotten
it), I don't think either can keep undoing successive changes like GNU
Emacs.

That might have been me, but I couldn't tell you for sure.

If it was me, I was probably talking about Perfect Writer, a
commercial more-or-less-emacs-clone published by Perfect
Software.  It was bundled with Kaypros for a while, and I'm
quite familiar with it because my Mom and I each did some
consulting work with Perfect for a while in the early '80s.

>It doesn't matter whether the commandset is very limited.  A very big
>boon would be an UNDO.

I don't recall whether there's an UNDO function.  Seems to
me maybe there is, but don't quote me.  Otherwise, the
commandset isn't too horribly limited.  Seems to me that the
default key-bindings diverge in places from normal emacs,
but they're all configurable (with some config utility, of
course -- no lisp in _my_ 54k TPA!).

Hmm.  You piqued my interest, so I just called my Mom, who
gave me the number of a former Perfect Software employee
with whom we worked for a while.  He gave me a number he had
for one of the founders of the company, but it looks like
he's left town.

For what it's worth, the guy I did talk to said he thought
the product line had been bought by Thorn/EMI, though what's
happened to it since then is anyone's guess.

There were at least three Modula-2 compilers for CP/M-80:

    1.  FTL Modula-2, which was previously mentioned.  This is probably
	your best bet as far as availability.  There were also versions
	of it for MS-DOS and possibly for some of the 68000 based
	computers (Amiga? Atari ST?).  This one produces very tight
	code, according to a review in MicroCornucopia.

    2.	Turbo Modula-2.  Developed by Borland, marketed by the now-
	defunct Echelon, Inc. (the Z-System company).  When Echelon went
	out of business, the marketing agreement died with it.  Borland
	disavows all knowledge of this compiler.  Produces somewhat large,
	very fast code.

	I own a copy of this one -- I bought it from the guy who reviewed
	it in Micro-C.  It has an integrated environment ala' Turbo Pascal.
	The one thing I don't like about it is that it is word oriented.
	This means that there is no such thing as a 1 byte variable --
	2 bytes is the minimum.  Makes setting up records to deal with
	things like FCB's a pain.

	Your only hope to get a copy of this compiler would be to find
	someone who is willing to sell their's.

    3.	There also was a compiler developed in Europe.  I recall seeing
	advertised in a flyer for Workman and Associates.  I think it
	went for about $150.  I'll see if I still have that flyer.

Sorry, I forgot another implementation, JRT Modula II.  You really
don't want to know about this one, possible the single most horrendous
language implementation I have ever seen.  Naturally, it was the one
I ended up buying...

And there was briefly an implementation from Wirth's outfit, Modula
Corp. and another from Volition Systems that ran under the P-system.
Did a Z80 ever run the P-system?

This was probably the Hochstrasser Computing AG compiler, which came I
think from someone near N Wirth's original group.  It was 150 *pounds
sterling* (I don't have a dollar price ) so I doubt it sold in quantity.
I know nothing else about it, but it reached version 2.01, so I suppose
it worked...

Perfect Writer was a customized version of MINCE, licensed from Mark
of the Unicorn.  The MINCE/SCRIBBLE package with selected sources to
customize and recompile into your own version was known as AMETHYST.
That went on to become FINAL WORD.  FW was ported to MS-DOS and ended
up as FW II before it was sold to Borland to become SPRINT.  Borland
still sells, but does not support SPRINT.  MotU, last I checked,
writes (MIDI?)  software for the music industry.  MINCE/FW/FWII are no
longer available from MotU.

Check the PD2:<CPM.AMETHYST> subdir here or the equivalently named
subdir on the mirror sites for AMETHYST-related files (but, not
AMETHYST itself).  PD2:<ARCHIVES.AMETHYST-USERS> contains the mail
archives.

Check PD1:<MSDOS.SPRINT> for SPRINT-related files, also much more on
Compuserve and on Borland's BBS.  Subscribe to SPRINT-L via

    Borland also marketed one that was sold by Echelon (the ZCPR folks)
and Micromint.  Requires a Z80.  My copy bears a 1986 copyright.  

    Echelon is out of business.  I don't know about Micromint.  I've
never brought it up (it came with a computer) so I can't comment on 
how good the package is.

    If someone wants it, I'm amenable to ridiculous offers ....

 I have one that I got from "The Alternate Source", a company that used
 to do a lot of stuff for the old TRS-80 computers.  I've got a Model 4
 here and do have the Modula-2 discs, but cannot test them because I do
 not have CP/M for the machine! :(
 
 drop me e-mail to work out arrangements for transmission of the disks.

This is version 2 (or possibly 1, I don't know the difference).  It has a
max of 512KB of RAM, and runs MSDOS 2.1.  I don't think it will run
DOS 3.3, but you could try.  I can't tell from the ROM numbers whether
you have a CP/M ramdisk or not; the driver for this on my machine is in
a file CPMRAM27.COM, where 27 is the version number of the CP/M (B2.27).
You could look for something similar.

The Titan card is initialised from a CP/M program usually called QXPC.COM.
Titan put this on a separate disk, configured to run QXPC.COM automatically
on boot, and called it a pre-boot disk.  Once the card has been initialised
the user is prompted to load the boot disk for the 16-bit O/S, which need
not necessarily be MSDOS.  There are a couple of device drivers on Titan's
MSDOS boot disk that eg. deal with the hard disk.  They need to be started
from CONFIG.SYS in the usual way - I don't think you can boot directly off
the HD, as the QX16 could.

If you can't find a copy of QXPC.COM let me know - I may still have the
2.1 version around somewhere.

Subject: a cp/m BDOS question
Message-ID: <2044.9302151257@csunb6.scs.leeds.ac.uk>

I'm trying to write so code that accepts an ambiguous file specifier
then for each matched file do something with it.

My code creates an anbiguous FCB (not at 5CH) and then calls BDOS function
17 (dec) Search for First dir. entry, creates a new second FCB for the
found file and then processes the file. The code then loops
on BDOS function 18 (dec) Search for next, doing the same with each
returned directory entry. 

If my program simply displays the name of the file returned, all is well
and I have a simple 'DIR' program. However if the program does any disk
access to the file then the search next function seems to repeatedly
return the first entry - it never moves on. Is this a known BDOS
problem ? Do I have to loop and preserve the returned file details,
and use the list to do the processing after the directory has been
scanned 'without interuption'?

I haven't been here for quite a while, but happy to resurface with
some good news.  DHN* will be back soon, sporting a larger hard 
drive and BBS software.  Unfortunately, all of 1992 files were
lost in the process but, the PACS BBS has kept current thanks to
Mike Finn and Sheldon Isaac, and we'll be back to it.  Looks like
perhaps 1-2 weeks at the outside.
  
Its hard drive went south in November, and with it the tape backup
turned out to be bad.  
  
Still hoping to restore the Royal Oak collection online shortly
thereafter.
  
Thanks go to ny folks at PACS (esp. Mike Finn and Bill Dockhorn)
who donated the entire PACS CP/M treasury to DHN* to purchase a new
drive...and to others, you know who you are!
  
Restoring from about 110 720k flops...phooey!  That is what is taking
so long, at the moment.

I have used the compiler for more than five years now, and I like it.  Efficient
code without serious bugs.  Huge control structures with many small branches
of inline code instead of subroutine calls may confuse it, though.  (Keeps your
style better... :-)  The compiler has four passes and the linker two, so compilation
isn't extremely fast on a floppy-based machine, but you can produce 64K of
code for an eprom if need be.  Compares favourably to some C compilers I
have used.  Library source has coroutine stuff that one could tailor to suit
one's hardware.

The designers sold the thing to Cats AG who once offered an update of it.  I
responded with more than a little delay and never got an answer.  Their ad
mentioned a z280 cross-compiler running under mess-dos among some other
things, so the source most probably hasn't been released to the public domain.

Message-ID: <1993Feb16.165217.11168@lut.ac.uk>

CP/M machines are still available in the UK. Amstrad sell a word processor
which contains a word processing package plus CP/M 3.

I have had my Amstrad PCW for 5 years and have upgraded it to
512k RAM and added a 3.5" disk drive (it has a 3" 'A' drive)

I have recently discovered ftp and would be grateful if ftp sites for
cp/m could listed, particularly games. They need to accept anonymous
ftp, though.


Cheers,

Paul Dobrott:

   Before you do anything with your IBEX computers, could you please send
copies of the boot disks to Don Maslin.  He maintains an archive of boot
disks for CP/M computers.  He has one IBEX boot disk that I provided him
with, but it would be good if he had additional copies that might have
different configurations.  This is especially true for your system with the
hard disk.  The one I got for him was for a system with two 8" floppies.
We really need a boot disk for an IBEX with 5.25" drives.  Do you have any
idea where one might get one?

Subject: Looking for some software
Message-ID: <1lsfc9$fdi@uxa.ecn.bgu.edu>

Hello out there,

I've got some old Kaypro's a model 4 and II and need some help.

The only cp/m disk I have is for the II and doesn't have much on it. I need
to find a format and copy for the 4 so that I can use the double sided
drives. I'm also looking for a spreadsheet and database. I have FTP access
but can't seem to find what I need. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks all.

Jay

Is there a public-domain c-compiler for CP/M somewhere?
Can anyone recommend a c-compiler for the Amstrad CPC-6128 ?

It's in TFM, if memory serves. You can't do anything else with BDOS while
you're doing searches; you have to save all the FCBs you find up and
process them later.

Remember, we're not talking about a re-entrant OS here...

What you are describing is NORMAL???  There is something that you need to
do but I just can't remember what it is precisely.  From what I recall,
you have to do a SEARCH FIRST on the file you just matched and then follow
with a SEARCH NEXT on the ambiguous FCB....no that does not sound right
 
I'll have to read MY docs...pull out the 40 K of source code where I have
all this stuff neatly tucked away.  Will re-post when I have the real
answer...ttys

According to Johnson/Laird's "CP/M Programmer's Handbook", whenever a
subroutine is called to get the >next< file, one must execute a Search First
function to re-find the previous file, using the same FCB as was used for
the previous find.  I would assume that the FCB used for providing the ambiguous
file name will contain, following a Search Next, the information necessary
to keep the process in synch.  It's been a while since I've worked with
these functions, so I can't give better details.

I have sent you an E-MAIL with two pages of source code showing roughly
how to proceed to get the SEARCH NEXT to work properly.  The trick is to
save the CURRENT search first file name, do your stuff with the matched
file, restore the search first file name, call SEARCH FIRST and follow
with SEARCH NEXT.  I have used this in an AFN file copy routine for a CCP
and it works just fine.....ttys

There are a couple of mailers out, but none have the boatload o'features
nor the candy coating that the MeSs-DOS ones typically do.  Ybbat and
Foodo/Pancake and Daisy are the common ones.  None of them are load-and
go, meaning they usually require some machine-specific customization to
get them to work correctly.

I can answer most questions about the Ybbat package.  It's been brought
up on most of the common CP/M machines.  The only one I know of where a
serious attempt to configure it has failed was the C 128, and in this 
case it would run, but had problems and the person doing it finally got
tired of messing with it.

There is a lot of interest and activity in the CP/M community.  To simply
say that CP/M is not dead is an understatement.  There are many active
CP/M users in Fidonet and a number of Fidonet nodes are hosted on CP/M
machines.
 
Good day        JSW

That's too bad.  I would like to see more CP/M implementations get on line.
As you probably found out, coding a program to implement the protocol that
is specified in FTS-0001 is relatively simple, but dealing with the
variations, deviations, violations, and real-world quirks of the many
different mailers out there is what makes the job difficult.

I and a few others have been playing around with the code to KTmail, the
latest Ybbat mailer for over a year now.  (For me, it's been more off than
on lately.)  It's to the point that it ALMOST does a good job of high-
speed windowed Sealink, even when it has to pause to access the disk.  I
am hoping somebody will take on the project of cleaning this up and adding
the few items necessary to give it the capability of the Dietifna variant
of Wazoo.  (If anyone's a fairly good Z80 assembler hacker and wants to try
a shot, please let me know.)

Yes, YBBAT, which just happens to be written by

I did actually write most of one in Turbo Pascal myself, but never

The classic archive for CP/M public domain software is
wsmr-simtel20.army.mil.  There is a mirror site of same on
wuarchive.wustl.edu.  Both will accept anonymous ftp.

The obvious ones are:

oak.oakland.edu            /mirrors/cpm  (slightly uncertain about this)
wsmr-simtel20.army.mil     pd2:<cpm>

These two have exactly the same files, but oakland is far easier to 
negociate your way about in.

I only know of small-C. See SMCxxx in the SIMTEL20 (or mirror) archives.
Mail me if you can't find it.

>Can anyone recommend a c-compiler for the Amstrad CPC-6128 ?
Commercial: 
- MIX C, for $19.95 or so. Pretty good K&R C, comes with a manual which is 
  more a C textbook. More an educational compiler than a production tool.
- Hi-Tech C, for about Aus-$200. I think it's excellent, I use it all
  the time. Some of the libraries are a little buggy, but that can be
  easily fixed, since you get the full source for the libraries. Note that
  this compiler is mostly ANSI compliant (although recently I seem to
  have found some bugs when casting things through (void *) pointer. I have
  the postal address and phone number for them at home, but they can
  be reached on the network as HITECH@HITECH.COM.AU.
- Aztec-C, I only know of its existence, not whether it can still be bought,
  or how expensive it is, and even less how good it is.
For cross-development on an IBM-PC or a Unix workstation, I only know
of the existence of a few suppliers, haven't tried any of them myself:
Hi-Tech, 2500AD, and MicroTec come to mind.

Good luck!

Public Domain: A zillion versions of Small-C.  That's all I believe.

Commercial: I know of MIX C and Aztec C.  The BDS C compiler, although
not 100% standard and lacking floats, is a classic.  I don't know about
the availability of any of those.  Specifically for the CPC you could
check out Arnor C (a full C implementation under CP/M+ from the guys
who brought you Protext).  Last thing I know is they're still in
business for the CPC.

ANSI C, C++: Forget it.
