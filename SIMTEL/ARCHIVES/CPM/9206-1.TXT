I am searching for a CP/M version of "Typing Tutor" or its equivalent for
teaching keyboarding skills, especially to children.  I an using a Morrow
MicroDesigns hard disk system.  Any suggestions for sources of such a program,
or other good sources for CP/M software?  Thanks!

Two CP/M computer systems for sale..  Make me an E-Mail offer..
-
1)  Altos 5-15D..  3 users.. Parallel and serial printer ports..  decent amount
 of software.  2 720K drives  (Total of 1.5 megs of floppy space..  No hard dis
k.)   Runs both MP/M and CP/M.    The size of an epson 80 column printer, excep
t taller (6 inches?)-
-
2) Super CP/M system: CompuPro System 10.. 4 users (Each has its own z80B (8 mh
z) processor..  Full "password entry" protection.. (That is, you can put it onl
ine as a RCP/M and every user will have an account on the system)  Mother proce
ssor is a 10MHZ 8088 (Five Processors total..  That is real processors.. not SI
O controllers! Really neat (Too bad I can't find UNIX for it)
-
40 MEG (SCSI or EDSI--not sure which--really fast, tho') drive (As Drives A->E)
 8" monster drive (In external case with power supply) 600K formatted disks..
 internal 5.25 800K floppy as disk F.  Disk G is a 10 meg tape drive.  I have n
ot used it.. It does work, however.. the software is on the disk.  The is ONE M
EG of memory in this CCP/M MACHINE.
-
4 users.. 2 serial ports for modem and printer (six serials total..) and one pa
rellel printer..  Really decent looking machine (The 8" external drive looks li
ke hell, but you can hide it or leave it off..  If you're running a RCPM outfit
, one generally wants the most bang for their buck.. the extra 600k is sorta ni
ce.)--A decent amount of software is on the HD.
-
Make me an offer..   I have to go back to KAnsas City to get it to have it ship
ped (It would take a few weeks for me to get a chance..)

hi,

  As far as I know, there is a version of kermit written for just
about every computer in existence (don't quote me on that, but as far
as I know - that is true), and it's available by ftp from columbia 
university....

   If you give me more specs on the phillips machine I can look into

Message-ID: <1992Jun2.164245.4005@msc.cornell.edu>

Summary of options to get CPM files to DOS:
====================================================================
Get Kermit for the CPM machines from Columbia archive.
====================================================================
An alternative is a piece of software called "moveit" which uses a serial
link between machines, but is fast at 9600 buad.  Can go CPM to CPM or
CPM to DOS, this will cost money tho and may be trouble to find.
====================================================================
I have used a package called "Uniform" to transfer data form old Kaypro CPM
machines without any problems. The software will set your PC floppy drive
to read literally dozens of different disk formats.

Uniform-PC, from Micro Solutions, Inc,
132 West Lincoln H'way,
DeKalb, Il 60115
(815) 756-3411

The address and phone number are from a manual copyright 1987, but
were correct in 1990.
====================================================================
Get the 22disk package for the pc. It supports most double density
softsectored CP/M formats.

WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL directory PD1:<MSDOS.DSKUTL>
 Filename   Type Length   Date    Description
22DSK138.ZIP  B  193057  920113  CP/M<->Diskette xfer, over 100 formats. SYDEX
or
        wuarchive.wustl.edu:/mirrors/msdos/dskutl/22dsk138.zip
====================================================================
I have a commercial product from Intersecting Concepts to do this, but
I think they have gone out of business, or merged with somebody.
====================================================================
There is (was) a program called "Media Master" which could convert
files from DOS to CP/M or from CP/M to DOS.

Thanks for the response.

  Microsoft Fortran-80 3.44
  Microsoft Cobol-80 4.65

I got these from someone else, so I can't make any guarantees.  You pay
your money and you take your chances.  But the price is right:  $10 per
package, $15 for two, $20 for three, etc.  You also pay postage.

I also have two sets of genuine DRC CP/M 2.2 documentation for sale, same
deal.

Yes, get Sydex' 22DISK (shareware), or MicroSolutions' UniForm-PC
(commercial), or Spectre Technologies' Media Master (commercial).  Assuming a
5.25" drive on the 386, you should be able to read the CP/M disks directly.  I
confess that I am not sure about Media Master and the Phillips, though.

Good luck.

I recently acquired a Cromemco TU-ART (TM) dual serial/dual parallel
S-100 board, without any documentation whatsoever.  I'd like to 
use it in the Altair system I'm trying to resurrect, but need some
more information from anyone who might have or know about one of these.

It's got 2 parallel and 2 serial ports, controlled by a pair of
TI TMS 5501 chips, and there's a block of DIP switches labelled:

                        0R45674567

                           A   B

So, any info on how to program the 5501's, which I/O port numbers the 
board uses, etc., would be very helpful.

Thanks,

Since I am new in this group I have even never heard of Simtel. What's

Speaking of disk reading software from Sydex (ie, 22DISK), does anyone
know the latest registration cost?  The shareware version I have here is
dated in 1988, and lists US$15 as the registration cost.

Any other details about Sydex (ie, address/phone if changed, etc) would
be appreciated too.

Email replies please - I'll provide a summary in two weeks time. Thanks

     I have the 16-sector Microsoft disk but it won't boot on my
present Z80 card, which is for CP/M 3.0.  However, all this stuff is
on disks that are physically Apple-format so very probably the CP/M
3.0 diskcopy program would work to clone a CP/M 2.2 disk (it clones
Apple ProDos disks just fine, doesn't seem to care what the bits
*do* as long as they're in the right place....)  Send me mail if you
want to pursue this.  I'll happily run you off a copy for free but
would like to be reimbursed for the cost of disk, mailer and postage.

There are two versions of the Aztec C Compiler in the package.  One 
generates code for the 8080, the other for Z80.  In version 1.05 (??)
Commercial edition, they were called cii and czii; the one with a 'z'
was the z80 compiler.  I have used the z80 version, ported decus cpp
for it etc, but it contains some aggravating bugs.  One that I haven't
been able to forget was that if(foo) and if(!foo) produced identical
assembler code.  1.05 isn't the latest release, though.

      Send me mail if you want the cpp - you might easily need it if
      your source contains a lot of #defines etc: the compiler is a
      one pass one and doesn't have lots of space to use when running.

The Aztec C that I've got on this machine has two flavors: CC builds 8080 and
CZ builds Z80. Frankly, the Z80 code isn't much of an improvement over the
8080 code; I think it just stores an occasional temporary in IX or IY, but
it's been a long time since I looked at the output.

That was a nice listing, but as the file names suggest, it is
NOT BDS-C. Rather, it is a collection of useful programs and
routines for use with BDS-C. BDS-C itself is NOT PD.

To anyone out there!

I recently picked up an IMSI CPM system and about 100 CPM boards.

I would like to get the system running. Mainly for the same reason
people restore old cars. Is there anyone who still knows how to 
configure a BIOS to get this beast running? Or can tell me what
areas in the BIOS needs to be adjusted? I have not yet powered the
system up, but there should be enough part there to get something
running.

Message-ID: <1992Jun11.152844.18940@midway.uchicago.edu>

	From the New York Times business section, June 11, 1992.

{Start article}
_Judge's Conversion to Bring Kaypro Liquidation_

	A judge said he would convert the troubled Kaypro Corporation
from bankruptcy status, which affords the personal computer maker
protection from its creditors, to bankruptcy status, which calls for
the company to liquidate its assets.  Federal Bankruptcy Judge James
Myers said last week that he would convert Kaypro from Chapter 11 to
Chapter 7, which requires liquidation.

	Howard Justus, the trustee named by the court to oversee the
final operations, said little appeared to be left of the once
fast-growing computer maker to liquidate, particularly when compared
with claims against the company.  Mr. Justus estimated that total
claims reached $20 million.  "All that's left is the cleanup," he
said.  In the two years the company has operated under bankruptcy
protection, Kaypro built up $2 million more in debt, Mr. Justus said.
Under the law, the $2 million plus an additional $1 million in debt
accumulated during pre-bankruptcy would have had to have been repaid
in full before Kaypro could be reorganized.  (AP)

I have a MicroBee DM30 (Cromemco 3102) terminal which I would like to
sell for $20.  These terminals do not emulate a VT100,  or any other
common terminal standard.  My hope is that somewhere a Cromemco owner
will give it a new home.  All manuals included.  Terminal is in
excellent shape.

My machine has a brother in Chicago!  I've got an '83 too.  I used it
regularly for word processing until buying a high-speed modem and
finding out it couldn't sustain 2400bps communications, much less 9600
or higher.  I had to buy an actual MS-LOSS machine.

The Kaypro has its place in my heart though, and occasionally makes a
very nice stool.

     There's always kermit, which for terminal purposes does very reliable
VT100 emulation and also has a file transfer protocol (not the fastest that
ever was, but at 19200bps you probably won't notice.)  I'm still trying to
make kermit-80 work on the Z80 card in me auld Apple but kermit-65 runs
fine on the 6502.  Wants interrupts *and* xon/xoff to keep from dropping
characters at high speed, however, and the combination of the two means that
19200 isn't noticeably faster than 9600.  One of these days I'm going to
hide the Unix box under the table and tell people I have the first AppleII
in the Known Universe to hit Dhrystone 20,000....

     Has anyone else tried to build CP/M kermit-80 from the files on
watsun.cc.columbia.edu?

It was my impression that the '84 had more advanced hardware in a
number of places than the '83 (including serial I/O).  If this is not
the case then the three modem programs I tried all screwed the pooch.
I used the "TERM" program but it started loosing at 2400bps.  I used
the "mdm700" or some such but it wouldn't even try anything faster
than 1200.  The same limitation existed for one other program I tried.

>If you have a copy of Mite that came with your Kaypro, you're all set for

'Mite' didn't ship with the '83's so far as I can tell.

All of this became moot when I bought a PC to handle communications.
It took awhile but I finally got it talking to the modem at 38kbps and
everyone's happy.

Only occasionally.  It's got some very interesting games and my one
and only copy of my address list so it still gets used, just not all
the time anymore.

Hi All,

	I recently purcheased a CP/M machine based on the Intel iSBC
86/05 processor board. It came with a startup disk with PIP on it,
but I want to do some development on it, and it is missing some
key files, like ASM86 and GENCMD. It uses 8" disks. Does someone
have these so I could make a development system? I believe that
once I get the ASM and GENCMD, I can download an XMODEM program
and start transferring the CP/M binaries, right? I looked
through the Simtel CPM section and need to study that a little more.

	Please send mail if you can help me out. Thanks!

		Steven

P.S. This is a system from '82....

I would like to find out were to get ZCPR3.  I would also like to

know if ZCPR3 comes with enough information to taylor it to my

hardware.  I have toyed with the idea of converting a Radio Shack

Model 3 to run CP/M.  To do this I will need to be able to switch 

RAM into the lower 16K where the RS has ROM and memory mapped I/O.

I think I can handle the hardware changes but I would then need to

be able to taylor the Zsystem to the new hardware.  I guess I will

need to write a BIOS or something.  I know ZSystem has been ported

to several Z80 platforms; is the platform specific code in the 

public domain?

	Stool is one possibility, but since we have 2 II'83's and one
Kaypro 1, I was thinking of trying more along the lines of a coffee
table.  The Kaypro XL we have is a PC compatible and is the wrong size
but also still in use.  More seriously, if I upgrade my 386 (sorry,
but I still actually have MS-DOS versions of Perfect Writer, The Word
Plus, and a few other things on it :-) to a UNIX machine, I was thinking
of using the old Kaypros as terminals.  My brother is still using one
of the II's for nearly all of his stuff.

	I'm surprised you had speed problems on the serial port.
We've used ours at 9600 baud over a null modem link with no problems.

	I felt rather insulted over the summer when my mother
suggested getting rid of the Kaypros (they actually reside in
Washington).  To be precise, she asked: "Is there a museum which would
take them?"

I've used my '84 2X as a terminal at 19200 bps.  How, you ask?  Interrupts!
If you have a copy of Mite that came with your Kaypro, you're all set for
speedy communications.  Mite is pretty bogus as far as scripts goes, and
my version lacks the nifty long packet Y- and Z-Modem stuff, but it gets
the job done.  And it uses interrupts to avoid dropping characters.

Their is a P.D. program on Simtel20 in the Kaypro directory (called 
fastterm or something *term) that also uses interrupts, but it can't
perform file transfers, and you have to reboot your Kaypro when you
are finished.  The source is there too for your hacking pleasure.

Use a Kaypro for a stool????  I think we could find it a good home
somewhere.

Wasn't there a version of YAM for the Kaypro? That'll do terminal

Hi netters,

I need some help in converting several disks (hopefully the files on them)
into any PC format. The problem is, that I don't know how to read the disks.
The system they where written with is called 'EXXON office system'. That's
labeled on the disks, and, as I was told, stood on the hardware too. At least
EXXON. 
These machines are already out of work for some years, and I assume they 
are at least 10 years old.
First try in my AT-clone 5,25" drive failed, of course. From the age I 
suspected some CP/M format. So I organized an CP/M reading software from
SYDEX, but no luck with all the 190+ different formats.

Does anyone know this system? Does anyone know how to read the disks (5,25",
DSDD, 96tpi) with an AT-floppy/controller?

Please e-mail me, or post in comp.os.msdos.apps.

Thanks in advance

I have a Kaypro II that someone gave to me, but no sofware came with it.
After much searching, I found some OS disks, and discovered that the
machine does not seem to even try to read the disk drives.  After
swapping with a known good drive, I figured the problem is upstream from
them.

This all leads up to my question:  Does anybody have Kaypro
schematics???  I know that the now defunct Micro Cornucopia used to sell
them, but I never had the need.  Now they are gone...

Thanks in advance, and if you can help, please respond via e-mail.

Re: Orphaned Kaypro's

I bought a used '83 Kaypro II with a busted B: drive, which I replaced promptly
with an Identical drive a friend was liquidating for $10 a piece.  So my
cost of the KAypro II with new drive was $35 and a bunch of discs.  It
has a 7 mhz processor accellerator that can keep up with 2400 as well as
9600 baud transmissions.

Kermit on my K10 does 19k through the tty port (serial printer port)
without any machine-dependent configuration.  I had assumed it must
be polling.  Impossible?  Pretty impressive, anyway.

Very sad to hear of this.  My Kaypro 4-83 occupies a place of honour under my
desk.  It has the nicest keyboard I've ever used on a computer (though that is
a very personal preference).  It was also great fun to use, and while Micro
Cornucopia magazine was in its Kaypro phase, was extremely well supported for
both hardware and software hacking.  In those days (I assume a long white
beard) it was still possible to fiddle with the machine at hardware and BIOS
level, modify the O/S, etc, without devoting *all* your spare time to
computing.

Now, I can't even persuade undergraduate students to borrow it to use for word
processing.

Speaking of disk reading software from Sydex (ie, 22DISK), does anyone
know the latest registration cost?  The shareware version I have here is
dated in 1988, and lists US$15 as the registration cost.

Any other details about Sydex (ie, address/phone if changed, etc) would

This is true -- CP/M Kaypros have no difficulty performing file
transfers at high baud rates by merely polling the serial port.
The problem comes with terminal emulation.  The '84 series Kaypros
are notoriously slow for things like clearing the screen, scrolling,
etc.  At 2400 bps, they will drop something like 30 or 40 characters 
after a clear screen command is issued!  

The '83 series machines are much faster at this stuff.  They use 
memory-mapped video -- the video RAM is bank switched in whenever 
the ROM is switched in.  I believe that the VRAM is located at 0x2000 
when it is switched in.

The '84 series (and all of the Kaypro 10s, I believe) use a 6845 or
6545 video controller chip, and the video RAM is only accessable
through that chip.  Its a lot slower, but you get all of those nice
video attributes, plus the 160 X 100 block graphics.  The only way
I know of for a '84 series machine to be a usable terminal is with
interrupts.  Heck, with Kermit-80 they'll drop 1 or 2 characters after
a screen clear at only 300 baud (using polled IO, of course)!  File
transfers are just fine, though.

Summary: Need switch settings, pinouts, other docs
Message-ID: <642@aardvark.Rain.COM>

I recently acquired a Cromemco TU-ART (TM) dual serial/dual parallel
S-100 board, without any documentation whatsoever.  I'd like to 
use it in the Altair system I'm trying to resurrect, but need some
more information from anyone who might have or know about one of these.

It's got 2 parallel and 2 serial ports, controlled by a pair of
TI TMS 5501 chips, and there's a block of DIP switches labelled:

                        0R45674567
                        ||||||||||
                        2N<--><-->
                           A   B

So, any info on how to program the 5501's, which I/O port numbers the 
board uses, etc., would be very helpful.

Thanks,

Does somebody know (or did anybody come across) a computer virus on
CP/M machines (I mean CP/M-2.* and CP/M-3.*)?  I do not think that
it is possible to have such a "program" that will go into the system
and not being noticed during the transfer of files and then run on its
own (without the user actually typing the program name or including it
in the .SUB files).  My claim is that such a program never existed
on those machines.  Can anyone support me on that?

Subject: Files needed for BIOS assembly
Message-ID: <1992Jun8.231644.4552@news.cs.indiana.edu>

I am in the process of building BIOS 4 from the package on SIMTEL.
All of the required files except "addbios.com" and "gencpm.com" are
on my Additional Utilties disk. After several rounds of returning
faulty disks to CBM, I managed to get a working Additional Utilities
disk, but the source disk was hosed.

So, if these two files are to be found on the source disk, I ask any
charitable soul who believes that I paid my $19.95 and am not trying to
bring CBM to bankruptcy by selling bootleg copies of "addbios.com" and
"gencpm.com" and who had better luck with their Additional Utilties
package to pass these files on to me, preferably uuencoded.

If these files are somewhere other than on the BIOS source disk, does
anyone know where? Also, I have heard about BIOS 5 but it doens't appear
on any FTP sites. Where can it be found?

Thanks for any help.

     I have the 16-sector Microsoft disk but it won't boot on my
present Z80 card, which is for CP/M 3.0.  However, all this stuff is
on disks that are physically Apple-format so very probably the CP/M
3.0 diskcopy program would work to clone a CP/M 2.2 disk (it clones
Apple ProDos disks just fine, doesn't seem to care what the bits
*do* as long as they're in the right place....)  Send me mail if you
want to pursue this.  I'll happily run you off a copy for free but
would like to be reimbursed for the cost of disk, mailer and postage.

That was a nice listing, but as the file names suggest, it is
NOT BDS-C. Rather, it is a collection of useful programs and
routines for use with BDS-C. BDS-C itself is NOT PD.

It's definitely possible - the fact that most CP/M machines boot from
disk makes it possible. However, it is unlikely to be able to do
much/survive across many machines simply because of the inherient
differences between the various machines that ran CP/M.

>
I've heard rumours that there was a CP/M virus, down to some details of
what it was supposed to do.  I'm sceptical because when I heard it was
really too late for anyone to bother with CP/M for writing a virus
because it wasn't mainstream any longer.

Glad to see other Apple CP/M enthusiasts!  I would be willing to Shrinkit and
Binscii the CP/M Master disk and upload it for mailing.  I would also include
a neat shareware program that can move text and binary files between DOS 3.3,
Apple Pascal, CP/M, and Prodos 8, inclusive!  If you dont't have Shrinkit and
Binscii, shame on you!  But if not, let me know and I will include them as well,
as they are Freeware.

Shade and sweet water,

I'm interested in establishing a dialogue with any such people so that I can

I've been using CP/M via the Apple ][-series for a number of years.  First with
a Franklin ACE 1000 with PCPI Applicard.  Then moved over to a //e, taking the
AppliCard with me.  I currently run a full-blown Z-System via the Seven League
Systems' CardZ180.  I experimented with a MS-Softcard clone for the purpose of
software development (overlays for QTERM v4.3e and ZMP v1.5)

Thanks for listening (reading) and I hope to hear from all you Apple CP/Mers!

If this is what I think it is (California Digital has offered CP/M in the
past), then it is for an old Xerox laptop computer (I don't remember the
number, but it had a 3 line LCD display) which used 5.25" disks.  The 8.5"x5.5"
CP/M manuals were from Digital Research, and came in a nice little binder,
which fit in a case (much like IBM's old PC-DOS manuals).  A good deal if you
needed CP/M documentation.

22DISK and UNIFORM do not have the format for the disks though, and I have no
clue as to what the format is.

I've got lots of TUART's, what do you need to know?  The dip switch
is (top is your label "2--0", "ON" is to the right) interrupt mode,
address reversal, and then the base address for device A (A4 thru
A7) and same for device B.  On the interrupt mode, 2 is for IM2 type
interrupts (Z-80), and 0 is for IM0 type interrupts (8080).  The base
address, combined with the following table, addresses the TMS 5501
functions/registers.

A3-A0                   Input                Output
======                  ========             =======
0                     status register        baud rate register
1                     rcv data register      tr data register
2                          ----                command register
3                     interrupt addr reg     intr. mask register
4                     dev. parallel port      dev. parallel port
5                             -----             timer 1
6                          ------             timer 2
7                          ------              timer 3
8                          ------             timer 4
9                          --------           timer 5

The address reversal bit (one can switch device addresses on the fly)
puts device addresses under software control when it's on, and under 
hardware control when it's off via pin 1 of J2 and J3.  Then grounding
this pin will reverse addresses.  Don't ground pin 1 of J2 or J3 when
the TUART is in software mode (dip sw. #2 ON).

The TMS 5501's ought to act like vanilla devices, if you can find the
specs. on them.  A word of warning:  initialize both 5501's even if
you use only one.  A half-arsed 5501 can generate bogus interrupts that
may/will drive you crazy.

I've got some TUART initialization code around here somewhere that I
might be able to send you ---  I had it at my fingertips not 10 years
ago!! @:^)  (just a little joke there!)

Good luck.

Subject: Registration coast of 22DISK (and address change)
Message-ID: <"19-Jun-92  9:38:57 EDT".*.Michael_D._Sprague.wbst311@Xerox.com>

The other day, someone asked what the current price of 22DISK was.  As I
registered a version a month ago, I went through all this.  Sydex has a
different address than that listed in the old shareware ... and the prices have
gone up somewhat.  Here is the scoop of interest from their current list (in
their words, not mine):


AnaDisk -- The complete diskette utility.  Nothing like it anywhere else; scan
edit; repair and copy just about any kind of diskette.  $25.00 registration
fee.

22DISK -- Transfer files, format, examine and erase files on "foreign" CP/M
diskettes on your PC.  Includes tips on supporting 8" and 5.25" single density
disks.  Contains definitions for over 270 different formats.  $25.00
registration fee.

22NICE -- A CP/M 2.2 emulation package.  Supports the NEX V-series chips or
performs emulation by software for both 8080 and Z80 processors.  Includes
terminal emulation and diskette handling for common CP/M systems.  Includes
22DISK.  $40.00 registration fee.

Sydex
P.O. Box 5700
Eugene, OR  97405
(503) 683-6033


I personally have used 22DISK and 22NICE.  I have had some trouble with 22DISK,
as I have reported before.  22NICE seemed to work pretty good for me, though I
had trouble with programs written for the Z80 (for example, the version of
UNCRUNCH that came with NC-COM would not work).  It ran M80 on my old 8MHz 286
much faster than my Xerox 820-II did ... but then, the 286 had a hard drive,
while the 820-II was floppy based.  :-)

Message-ID: <1992Jun22.121326.9442@newshost.anu.edu.au>

   I have just started looking at writing a BackGrounder ii screen 
driver for the Big Board II, but I do not fully understand what I am
doing.  The release notes that came with the package refer to a file
called BGSCREEN.DOC which has some extra info on writing a driver.
I didn't get this file.  Could someone send me a copy please?
   I collected some screen drivers from SIMTEL, so I could probably
muddle my way to a completed source, although a detailed description
of entry points and functions would be nice.  But how do I turn it
into a .DRV file as BGii requires?  Is it just a renamed .REL file, or 
is there something more?
   Finally, and maybe I should have asked this first up, does anyone
have a Big Board II driver they would be willing to share?
   Any help would be most appreciated.
Thanks, Peter Manson.

Subject: Help with Compupro 816...
Message-ID: <1992Jun21.050746.29457@wuecl.wustl.edu>

	I just recently picked up an old Compupro 816 system.  It's a great
	looking machine.  The only problem is that it didn't come with
	any documentation.  Popping the case revealed the following cards:

		3 RAM22 cards
		4 SP186 cards 
		1 SPIO card
		1 Compupro 286 card
		1 System Support card
		1 Disk 1a card
		1 Disk 3 card

	The computer came with a 5 1/4 and 8 inch drive.  The harddrive
	is a full height 72 mb Control Data disk.  Upon powerup the
	hd light comes on and never goes off.  It doesn't even try to 
	access the floppies.  

	The other problem I have is that I can't
	figure out which port on the back is for the console and at
	what speed.  I've been assuming the rs-232 from the system support
	card was the console.  With all the Intel cpus inside I guess
	it ran a kind of multiuser msdos.  If anyone has manuals 
	or documentation I'd gladly pay for a copy and 
	shipping.  I'd probably need a copy of the boot disks too.
	I looking forward to getting this beastie running and any
	help would be appreciated.

	tony!

Sure, why not?  I wrote a ZMP driver a long time ago for the
SoftCard (and any compatibles which map $C0xx (6502 addressing
syntax) to 0E000h (Z80 syntax) and do direct memory-mapped I/O.

Yeah, it's called the "BD Software C Compiler".  There are many versions
of it.  Somehow it ends up on everyone's diskettes even though they don't
know where it came from.

I've heard of that cp/m virus too.  Even to reading the Email from the
person who did it, just to see if it was possible.  Unlike others, this
fellow was ethical enough to keep his virus in a "test tube", and not
release it.  Many Thanks, whoever you are!!!!  His rationale for writing
the virus was to gain experience with programming, not to blow others
out of the water...

Chasened by my recent experience writing a Z-80 interpreter in C
(for those who don't remember, a simple DIR under CP/M took
5 minutes on a Sun 3), I have decided to give it another whack,
but this time the main functionality will be done by an array
of pointers to functions instead of a big case statement.
That ought to make the thing a bit more efficient.

I'm just starting work on it, but thought that now's the time to
line up alpha testers willing to run the thing through its
paces, offer suggestions, code the infamous "DAA" instruction,
etc.

Message-ID: <kg@byu.edu>

I have an Apple//c with a Z80 installed and running that system in CP/M is a  
bit painful.  I remember using TERM programs with a 1200 baud modem and I  
found that I had to either change it to 300 baud or have the BBS send one or  
two nulls at the beginning of each line so my display could catch up.  I  
thought that the old IBM was slow, but that screen display on my //c in CP/M  
is EXTREMELY slow!  It sure is alot slower than it is in DOS 3.3 or ProDOS.   
Does anyone else have that problem?

Another thing that I am looking for is a version of KA9Q that was originally  
written for a Xerox 820 (I think that is the model).  Does anyone have it?  I  
could really use a copy.  Some people have it, but it is on 8" disks and they  
don't have any way to get it on 5.25 or do anything with it.  Can anyone help  
me.

I just called California Digital this afternoon.  They are willing to sell
individual copies of CP/M 2.2 for $15 + $6 shipping.  You get a disk (XEROX
format), a serail #, and the manuals.  They Rep said if you already have CP/M
and are ordering this just to get the serial # and manuals to just copy your
own working system disk onto the one you receive.

There number is 800-421-5041.  They want to unload these!  He made a comment 
about a price break if you bought a lot of 1000 copies! ;-)

---
I tried to mail a response to John Donald Baker with no success (mail gateway
problems).  I have been using CP/M on an Apple II+ since 1985.  I have a set
of include files for Turbo Pascal 3.0 that provide access to the II's Hi-res
graphics (and paddle controls).  I have a 3D graphics lib too, but it is still
under developement (unfortunately that project has been on hold for a while).

I know the Master I have is 2.2, but off hand I could not tell you if there is
further version info (I think it may be 2.2B, though).

> to be able to recognise much of my RAM... apparently newer versions should.

OK, my understanding is that CP/M 2.2 gives you 56K of usable space.  If there
is an Apple version of CP/M 3.0, that should give 60K of work space (out of 64Kof memory).  To access more requires a different BIOS, I believe.  I know that
some of the Z280 systems have 512K system memory, but I don't know of anything
for the Apple (I still use a II+).  I thought about getting an AE Ramfactor
board several years ago, until I found out that to use it under CP/M, I would
have to purchase their Z80 board as well (which came with CP/M 4.0 or 5.0, or
some such animal).

I don't know if Z-System would be able to take advantage of additional memory
or not.  I just recently started looking into the product.

Sounds like my system, only minus 3 SP186 cards and a SPUZ thrown
in for good measure, plus 3 M-DRIVE/Hes with 512K apiece, an
Interfacer 3, and an Interfacer 4.

Don't worry about that.  It ALWAYS does that.

Try putting something in either drive and punching the Reset
button.  If there's nothing in the boot drive, whatever it may
be, it goes IMMEDIATELY into the hard disk bootstrap mode.

Your assumption is quite correct.  You do need DTR for the system
to boot.

The operating system is called Concurrent DOS.  I have two

I'll certainly try my best, though my unit is in storage, and the
72megger is on my DOS machine because the one I had been using on
it died.  But if you want to shoot the breeze about it, gimme a
call at (916) 344-5360.

Well, it is probably a product of the long defunct Vector Graphics of Westlake
Village CA.  They built some interesting machinery, although some was
handicapped with hard sector diskettes.  If you don't think that too much of
the Apple rubbed off on it and the price is right, go for it!

Subject: VT100 Emulation for H89??

Help,
  I am the proud owner of 2 H-89s.  I bought my first one in 1980 and it has
been running fine since with only 1 minor problem.  I have found myself back
in school working on my BS in Computer Science.  It is a real stretch
financially but, I WILL MAKE IT!  I use my old baby as a terminal to communicate
with the VAX at school.  Here is the poblem at hand.
  The vax supports Kermit protocol so i downloaded a copy of the kermit
communications package from Columbia University but it does not support VT100
mode  it has the capability to emulate vt52 but that is all.
  Is there a comm. package that supports vt100 emulation for my terminal?  If
so where can I get a copy of it.  I hope that it is in a form that I can load
thru bitnet as I use the old 5-1/5" 10 sector Hard disk format and the media is
all but impossible to find anymore.

Thanks for any help that anyone can provide.

The only extra memory I can use is a Cirtech PlusRAM board which I can use
as a ramdisk (drive F:). Cirtech supply a program to set it up, but it only
works under 2.23 and above, so far as I can remember. I also now have
(possibly temporarily) the use of an AST SprintDisk - I'll see what I can
do with that, if anything.

Well, I've never seen a virus on my CP/M machine (actually it's an
SB180FX running ZSYSTEM, but that's compatible to CP/M) but I assume
that one could get a virus into such a system.
A virus does not necessarily have to be a complete "program", virusses
(viri/vira?) can also be attached to existing programs. I have the
impression that this is actually the usual way to have a virus.

There is one big difference between MS/DOS and CP/M that make having a
"free" virus in CP/M a little more difficult: the management of free disk
blocks. CP/M rebuilds (part of) it's free block list every time the
current list drains (call this "garbage collection"). That means that a
virus occupying a disk block that does not belong to a file, will sooner
or later be allocated to a growing file. MS/DOS on the other hand, has
it's FAT, which describes ON THE DISK which blocks are free and which
are in use. Therefore a virus can hide in a "non free" but also "non
allocated" block, pretty much like a "bad block". Under CP/M You would
have to group bad blocks into a file.

Of course, You can always attach a virus to an existing file. All CP/M
executables are "COM"-files, i.e. the entire contents of the file are
placed into memory and then execution commences at address 100h (0x100).
You could place a "JMP virus" there which jumps to the added code and
the added code then returns to e.g. 103h. However, think about what You
can (or cannot) do with a mere 56k of free memory (some CP/M systems
have even less).

As I said, I've never tried to write a virus myself, I've never seen one
on CP/M, and thanks to the widespread (commercial) use of MS/DOS, I
am glad no-one actually cares enough about CP/M to actually launch a
viral attack b-{)

Subject: Extremely basic newbie questions
Message-ID: <61164@cup.portal.com>

Hi.  I've been programming and using a variety of computers for at least
the last twelve years, but have never had occasion to become involved with
CP/M, until very recently the stars and planets aligned and, well, here I
am.  To wit, a friend's Commodore 128 has a "Z-80 side" that can run CP/M.  
I have a CP/M emulator for my Amiga.  We share a Z80 Microprocessor Reference 
Manual that I've had since 1982 and have used exactly once.  So we've both
got CP/M and a rudiment of Z80 programming reference, and we're curious what 
can be done with CP/M and how we might write programs for it.   Neither of us
currently know ANYTHING WHATSOEVER about CP/M except for its name and that 
"it's an operating system."

My questions, then, are these:

1) How does a person typically develop programs for CP/M?  What languages,
   makes/versions of text editors, compilers, and assemblers are there, and 
   is there any that's considered a "standard?"  Anything PD?
   
2) How would I go about placing any of these tools onto my Amiga CP/M emu-
   lator or my friend's C=128 "Z80 side"?  Again, are there any "standards?"
   Is everyone still using XMODEM, which I understand was developed under
   CP/M as a "standard" file transfer protocol, way back when.

3) What does the CP/M programming interface consist of?  I presume since
   "CP/M is an operating system," one makes calls to standard routines to
   perform I/O, set/get system/device/etc. information, and so on.  What 
   operations, and what kinds of operations, exist, and how does one access 
   them?

I don't really know enough to ask any more questions than these, but this 
is obviously just the tip of an iceberg.  I've already subscribed to
comp.os.cpm here, but Portal imposes a delay of a day or so before I can
actually use the newsreader on a new newsgroup, so if you reply to this be-
fore about June 28 I might not see it; please e-mail even if you also post.

 Thanks in advance,

Hi Paul, your message has to be pre-formatted to be read by the Usenet
Gateway, then it will make it onto The Internet. Like this:

the first line has the "to: user@host.site.organisation", then a blank
line after that, and then you can type your message.



Pretend the next line is really line #1.

Beginning of your message text....




I wasn't too sure of it for a while, but after being reminded by other
users in the Usenet conferences, and getting reply mail back, it's
really useful. Oh yeah, you have to check conference 104 (usenet
replies), for messages that are sent to you directly as E-Mail, rather
than the others that you see here, that are News messages.

        /B/ .........TTYS!!

Quite true for private mail, but I posted it as a public message.
That's the way it works for Usenet, but if this is Internet and the
rules are different, then that's something else altogether.

I'll ask the powers, and see.

Subject: Is there a good archiving tool ?
Message-ID: <1992Jun26.191134.4687@cns.umist.ac.uk>

Is there a public domain archiving tool for CP/M that compresses files
as they are inserted in the archive ?  I am helping out a friend who
is starting out with a CP/M system but myself come from a DOS
background.

He is working on a system with a allocation blocksize of 4K and many
of his files are typically 3K of WordStar text and so he reaches the
directory entries limit of 128 files with only 30% of the disk used.

Thanks in advance.

Peter Green.

Both of your messages made it onto the net, so you were right.  The "To:" line
is not needed.
