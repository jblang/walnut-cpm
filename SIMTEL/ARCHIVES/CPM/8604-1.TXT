I am trying to locate someone with software for the HP 125.  Specifically, I
hope to find a copy of the Programmer's Package. This contains a variety of the
normal systems utilities for CPM.  Since HP no long manufactures the 125 and
is not making its software available any longer I'm having to look elsewhere.
If anyone has this or any other software which they would be willing to
a copy, or know of anyone who would, I would appreciate getting a response.

Thanks,

Subject:  Posting of commercial messages:

Fellow CP/Mers - Occasional postings of messages offering or announcing items
for sale have caused some flurries of (sometimes) heated debate concerning
"proper use" of the Defense Data Network, through which INFO-CPM is distrib-
uted.  I believe that most subscribers to this list honestly wish to adhere
to the "network rules" and not jeopardize INFO-CPM's use of the DDN.  But
although the policy regarding personal "for sale" messages has been clearly
stated many times (they're not allowed), it has become quite obvious that the
lack of a clearly stated policy concerning new product announcements is causing
much frustration to those who wish to post such information while still
"playing by the rules".  Therefore, this message states my interpretation of
the regulations, and presents a resulting policy to which I, as INFO-CPM list
maintainer, ask all DDN subscribers to adhere.  I also ask that contributors
to "NET.MICRO.CPM" on USENET voluntarily cooperate so that the mutually bene-
ficial news gateway between INFO-CPM and NET.MICRO.CPM is not threatened.

     The June 1984 issue of the "DDN Directory" gives on page 12 the following
statement concerning use of the network:

	"The DDN is an operational DoD network and is not intended
	to compete with comparable commercial service.  It is intended
	to be used solely for the conduct of or in support of official
	U.S. Government business."

It is the vagueness of the term "official U.S. Government business" that forces
a local interpretation to be made, and that is the reason for this message.

     Briefly stated, my policy is this:

	1. I offer to act as a clearinghouse for all new product announcements
	   posted by persons having remunerative interests in the products.
	   Persons wishing to post such announcements are asked to send them to
	   INFO-CPM-REQUEST@AMSAA.ARPA for forwarding to the list.  Please note
	   that this applies ONLY to "remunerative interest postings".  Readers
	   having no such interests are always welcome to send comments about
	   products, new or old, directly to INFO-CPM.

	2. Messages offering personal items for sale must not be posted.

This policy is explained in more detail below.


     PRODUCT ANNOUNCEMENTS:  I feel that the information value of a product
announcement must be weighed against possible personal rewards when making a
decision about use of the network.  There are many government-owned computers
running CP/M, and on which serious government work is being done.  Several
years ago, the DARCOM Microcomputer Software Support System (DMSSS) project
was instituted, with one of its aspects to provide a repository of public
domain software on the net.  INFO-CPM was sponsored as the official vehicle
for announcements of the status of the collections, and to promote the inter-
change of user information on the use of CP/M and the programs which run under
it.  This is why INFO-CPM is "in support of official U.S. Government business".
New products that provide improvements to the CP/M operating system, to
associated utility programs or to the machines on which these programs run
offer productivity increases to government users.  Therefore, it is in the
government interest to distribute factual information concerning such products.
Still, when an individual having a personal monetary interest in a product
posts an announcement concerning that product, it raises questions about
"commercial use of the network".

     Therefore, as I have no involvement with any provider of CP/M-related
products or services, I offer to act as a "clearinghouse" for all new product
announcements being submitted by persons having remunerative interests in
these products.  I ask that all individuals wishing to post such announcements
via INFO-CPM send them to INFO-CPM-REQUEST@AMSAA.ARPA.  My requirements for
relaying such messages to the list are:

	1. They must be of general interest to the "CP/M community".  Products
	   that address specific subsets of this community, such as those
	   which operate with or on an "XYZ machine running CP/M 2.2" meet
	   this requirement.

	2. They must be brief and factual, listing the salient features of
	   the products, and giving brief explanations of the techniques used
	   to achieve improved performance (if applicable).  In short, they
	   must be INFORMATIVE.

	3. They must be free of advertising hype - no superlatives.  Compar-
	   ative words such as "better" and "improved" are OK provided brief
	   explanations are given as stated above.

	4. They should include the name and netmail address of a person to whom
	   requests for additional informaton can be directed, or a statement
	   that no additional information is available if that is the case.

I will not attempt to present here an all-inclusive, "iron-clad" set of rules,
as I do not believe it can be done; and if it can, I don't know how.  Please
send any questions regarding this matter to INFO-CPM-REQUEST@AMSAA.ARPA, and
NOT to the entire list.  If further clarifications seem necessary, I will
update and resend this message.

     PERSONAL "FOR SALE" MESSAGES:  I think there is a very significant
difference between product announcements and personal "for sale" messages.
Products that are offered to the public which provide new capabilities, or
which improve the performance of existing systems offer these same benefits to
government users.  But personal deals are "one-on-one", and unless the buyer is
a government user (which I consider an extremely remote possibility considering
the "red-tape" associated with procurement), no benefit can accrue to the
government.  Therefore, personal small-volume offerings violate the intent
of the rules and should not be posted.

     REPLIES TO POSTINGS:  Please make intelligent decisions regarding replies
to product announcements.  If such a reply is of general interest, then feel
free to send it to INFO-CPM@AMSAA.ARPA (i.e., to the entire list).  I will
include with each posting the address of a person to contact for additional
information (or a statement that no further information is available, if that
is the case).  Please send non-general-interest replies PRIVATELY to the person
listed, and NOT to the entire list.

     If a personal "for sale" message does appear in INFO-CPM and you wish to
respond to it, please do so PRIVATELY and not to the entire list.  If your
mailer can't send private replies, then DO NOT REPLY at all.


     The above policy has been coordinated with the Army Ballistic Research
Laboratory personnel responsible for monitoring BRL's network access, through
which INFO-CPM is delivered to the DDN.  This message will be repeated period-
ically for the information of new readers, and to refresh the memories of
others.  Your cooperation will help to insure the continued existence of the
INFO-CPM newsgroup.

ReSent-Date: Wed 2 Apr 1986 04:44-MST

Some time ago, I posted Version 1.0 of Ron Raikes' (WA8DED)
replacement firmware for the TAPR TNC-1 and its clones.  I just got a
copy of version 1.1, and it is now available on SIMTEL20.

Filename			Type	 Bytes	 CRC

Directory PD:<CPM.PACKET>
TNCDED11.DOC.1			ASCII	 34943  D17BH
TNCDED11.HEX.1			ASCII	 32264  CD0BH
TNCDED11.UPD.1			ASCII	   655  E233H

Here is the update information for this release:

                   Changes incorporated in version 1.1


    1.   FRMR link status messages are displayed properly

    2.   Monitored FRMR frames are displayed properly.

    3.   Handling  of  all  supervisory  frames  has  been   improved
    considerably.

    4.   Transmitter PTT line is not asserted if source call sign  is
    left blank.

    5.   Connect requests  from  invalid  or  blank  call  signs  are
    rejected.

    6.   Changing connection path  from  direct  to  via  digipeaters
    works properly.

    7.   Handling of XON/XOFF has been improved considerably.

    8.   Information sent to an unconnected channel 1  -  4  in  HOST
    mode is discarded.


Ron says that number 6 is the only one that should affect most users.
I think number 7 should help people using computers and communications
programs.  I also think number 4 is a great idea. I hope other vendors
pick up on it. No more connects from "ABCDEF", "NOCALL" or "PK64"!

A quick review for those who haven't heard of this firmware before:

WA8DED, like many of us, got annoyed at the lack of a maintenance
release for the TAPR TNC-1 and clones - the Heath HD-4040, AEA model
whatever, etc. These are the ones with a 6809 microprocessor.  Unlike
most of us, he sat down and did something about it. He wrote this
firmware which replaces the original TAPR V3.1, 3.2 or 3.3 firmware.

It provides many of the features of the newer TNC devices. The main
things, in my opinion, are support of AX.25 version 2, support of
multiple simultaneous connections, much improved monitoring facilities
and a mode specifically designed to interface to a local computer
rather than a terminal, thus solving the flow control and binary
transparency problems. Also, all the local parameters are in
documented locations, so you can burn them in the EPROM and not have
any problems with flakey NOVRAMs.

I highly recommend that this firmware be placed in any digipeaters
still using the TAPR code, to allow AX.25 version 2 frames to be
repeated.

The one down side of this firmware is that the command interface as
seen by the user is NOT compatible with the TAPR firmware. The command
functions are there, but the command names are different, and there is
no "command" versus "converse" mode.  This makes it incompatible with
programs written to talk to a TAPR TNC, such as the W0RLI
MailBox/GateWay system.


If you cannot read these files from SIMTEL20, I will try to help out
on an "as time is available" basis:

If there is a mail path between you and me on which it is polite to
send such large files (34K for the DOC file, 31K for the HEX), I will
mail them to you.

If you want them on disk, I can write IBMPC 360K MS-DOS type 5.25"
disks or 8" SSSD CP/M type disks.  Send me a blank disk in a reusable
mailer and with return postage.

I am not able to make EPROMs for you or provide the files on a dial-up
basis. Sorry.

DRI used to say that information about the use of the S1 and S2 bytes (the
ones at 0D & 0E in the FCB) was proprietary.  Now that they have ceased to
support CP/M, can anyone give us a good explanation of their use(s)?

[just plug it in, and it works]

Is there anyone out there using the STD bus?
If so, how do you rate the vendors?

I have a few brochures.
Pro-Log has a very informative catalog and seems
to have a lot of support.  They say they developed the STD bus in 1978
and put it in the public domain.  They have a lot of boards.

Mostek's boards and chips don't appear to be very good.
For example: the MK3801 Serial Timer Interrupt Controller has bugs
with IEO (the interrupt priority daisy chain) where it is slow
to carry the IEI, and can prematurely reset.  The 12 slot
card cage motherboard has all the signal traces on ONE SIDE
with no interleaving grounds!  Now I see why Vector and Matrix
charge so much for their double-sided boards with the
interleaving grounds!

	So, how about it?

I am trying to locate someone with software for the HP 125.  Specifically, I
hope to find a copy of the Programmer's Package. This contains a variety of the
normal systems utilities for CPM.  Since HP no long manufactures the 125 and is
not making its software available any longer I'm having to look elsewhere. If
anyone has this or any other software which they would be willing to copy, or
know of anyone who would, I would appreciate getting a response.

Thanks,

Most 80-Column cards for the Apples and clones emulate the Datamedia
terminal.  Support for this terminal really isn't that great -- at least
on the systems I've worked with.  I get along fine using ASCII Express
(DOS 3.3 (blech!) or ProDOS) emulating a VT52.  AE lets you emulate ten
different terminals.

Subject: dBASE2 on CP/M & MS-DOS
To: info-cpm@AMSAA.ARPA
Message-ID: <[MC.LCS.MIT.EDU].875663.860406.STORK>

A few weeks ago, I asked whether dBASE2.4n data and command files are
compatible on CP/M and MS-DOS versions of the program.  My reason
was that I use CP/M, but a friend whom I'm helping to computerize
his Optician Business needs to go to MS-DOS for cost and
capacity reasons.

I got encouragement from the net, procured the latest MS-DOS version
(2.43*) of dBASEII - it works perfectly!  Of course,
there are a few changes in 2.43 that would require minor
mods even from earlier MS-DOS versions (e.g., they
dropped the CHANGE command, which requires  a work-around with
@ n,n SAY and GET), but nothing serious.  The point is that
a CP/M user can easily support and MS-DOS user if both run dBASEII.

Now, another question: On p.620 of the Advanced Programmers Guide
for dBASE II/III (Castro, Hanson, Rettig), data are
provided for POKEing out the EJECT function in
dBASE II ver.2.3 - 2.41.

Does anyone know the proper POKE values to do this for
Ver.2.43* MS-DOS?  Would much appreciate the data.

Eric.

Subject: CPM 3.0 Network software

As the result of an aborted contract, the company I work for part-time has
acquired a 95% complete version of CPM 3.0 (no, not CPM 2.2) Networking
software.  The software requires one (or more) CP/M 3.0 machines to act as
"server"(s), and allows other ("user") CP/M 3.0 machines transparent,
error-free access to files or devices on the servers, via assignable logical
device names.  User software need not be modified at all, and the advantages
of banked addressing are retained unchanged. Network hardware required is
simply an RS232 port (SIO) on each server and user machine, and a very
simple RS232 repeater box.  At 19.2K baud serial link rates, the network
performs suprising well.  A side benefit is the installation of a real-time
operating system UNDERNEATH CP/M 3.0, which has shown some nice throughput
improvements even for non-networking applications. The question my company
is interested in, is there any interest in pursing further development of
this product?

Please respond directly to me, and I will summarize any interesting answers.

    I personally have Z80ASM from SLR systems, and I love it.  It cost $50.,
has full macro facilities, generates HEX, COM, or REL output, and is
super-fast.  Their linker is an additional $50, but there is also a public
domain linker (PROLINK, I think it's called) that was developed by
Night Owl software and used internally in the development of MEX.
    If, as I suspect, you don't need this much power, there is at least one
public domain Z80 assembler.  I think there is one that is also called Z80ASM
that handles macros but generates only HEX files.
    ZAS, from Echelon, is also a reasonable choice.  This package costs
$80 (I believe) and includes an assembler, linker, and librarian.  I have
not used ZAS but am told that it is much slower and fussier about its input
than Z80ASM from SLR.
   M80, from Microsoft, was still selling for $200, last time I heard. It's
slow and buggy.  It does, however, handle either Z80 or 8080 opcodes, unlike
the above, which handle only Z80.  M80 includes a linker and librarian.

   You should ask yourself what features you need in an assembler,
especially whether you need one that can generate relocatable code.

I  recently  acquired  (through a death of a friend of the family)
a   CP/M   computer   called  the  Nylac  II  (by  Nylac  Computer
Corporation).   No  documentation  came  with  it,   so I'm hoping
someone  out  in  netland  might be able to help.  Any information
about   this   beast   (including   history)    would  be  greatly
appreciated.  

For those interested, this is what it is:

	1.  It is integrated into a terminal like enclosure with
		dual 5 inch disks to the right of the screen (hard 
		sector).
	
	2.  It has a detached keyboard with a row of function keys
		across the top that are labeled with Electric Pencil
		functions.

	3.  Inside it has a motherboard with most of the useful things
		built in.  It has 3 S-100 slots.  One of the slots is
		occupied with the floppy disk controller.

	4.  The software  that came with it includes CP/M, Electric
		Pencil (which seems to also be called QUILL3), and
		MBASIC.

Re: Z80 assemblers

   There is another public domain Z80 assembler that is not too
widely known.  It's the assembler described in Gordon King's book,
"A Z80 Assembler for CP/M".  It produces list and hex files, but
will not handle macros or relocatable code.  An improved version
was promised in the book, but I haven't seen anything on it yet.

   Unfortunately, King's book is out of print, but there may still
be a few copies available through Micro/Systems Journal.  In their
last 2 or 3 issues, they offered copies of King for $25.95 (I think).
Also, I have a copy of the assembler (translated to fairly standard
Z80 assembler) on tape and can send it to any interested parties
over the BITNET.

Thanks to all who responeded to my query about

The overwhelming majority of those who replied recommeded
Andy Johnson-Laird's book "CPM Programmer's Handbook", so
I thought I'd pass that bit of information to any of you out

I'll appreciate any help anyone can give.

I seem to be in over my head.  I'm trying to set up a private BBS
for a non-profit (religious) radio station.  They have a Hayes 1200
modem and an Osborne-1.

I got the bye339 stuff from simtel20, but I can't seem to make it
work.  It writes strange characters all over the screen and, what
is even more frustrating, it doesn't act consistently.  One time it
does one thing, and the next time it does something else.  If I
persist, the disk develops bad sectors.

I noted in the documentation of bye5 that bye5 will not work with
the Ozzy-1 unless there is a hardward mod.  Is that what the problem
is with the bye3?

The bottom line is that I need to find out whether there is a version
of bye that will run on the Ozzy-1, preferably without a hardware mod.

Can anybody out there help me?

Small-C is cute, but non-standard. For as little as $39.95 you can get
MIX-C, which claims to be full K&R standard compatible, and comes with a
400 page manual and tutorial (a very good value, in my opinion). The
tradeoff is it doesn't produce very efficient code. There are other C
compilers for CP/M for under $100, see magazines like Byte, Dr. Dobbs,
etc for ads. If you're interested in learning about compilers, Q/C comes
with full source for itself written in C ($99 for the whole package).

I don't know much about Q/C, just remember that it got a good review
some time ago when Dr. Dobbs (or was it Byte, or Computer Language
magazine, or all three?) featured a review of several C compilers for
CP/M. The fact that it included its own source code in C made it an
especially good value from an educational standpoint.

I have the Mix C compiler, and while the manual looks VERY good, I
have yet to get my machine to read the fool disks!  I have a Heath
H 89 with 40 track ds disks, and that is the format I ordered from Mix,
and the format that Mix says it sent me.  However, I can't read the
disks on the 40 track drives, nor on a recently-purchased 80 track
drive.  However, I HAVE successfully read the disks on a neighbor's
H 89 with 80 track drives.  The disks, as it turns out, are indeed
recorded in the Heath 40 track format.  As yet, I still have not been
able to get the fool things read on my machine!  The problem is driving
me up a wall.

As to the compiler itself, several of the folks at the Baltimore Heath
Users Group think quite highly of the compiler.  One caveat about the
manual:  The type style used in the manual doesn't distinguish between
the number 1 and a lowercase letter l.  This has caused some confusion.

Reply-To: Info-Cpm@AMSAA.ARPA

The following is a file relayed from my RCP/M.

				NOTEFILE TXT

Notes  toward  an imaginary--and much needed--text database program  in  the 
public domain.

				     *

I  am  not a programmer. But I know of a program that would be welcomed by a 
great many writers using CP/M systems.  Perhaps  I could try  to learn   how 
to  program it,   but that would take too long:   I want to  USE  it  before 
then.  What  is needed is a public domain text database  file.  Notebook,  a 
commercial program from Pro/Tem,  accepts only 9 lines of text in the	CP/M 
version,  which	 is far	too limited.  What I propose is	a program that makes 
use of the model of Dirfiles.com. Dirfiles, a public domain program, creates 
a  listed directory of all files on a disk,   to which a line of comment can 
be appended.  It is used on most  boards and by many individuals to identify 
the  purpose  of the  various programs on the disk.  This is how  I  suggest 
Dirfiles be modified to  create NOTEFILE.COM:

1)  Make it possible to	invoke Dirfiles	from within a  single  file,  rather 
than drawing on	the directory of the whole disk.

2)  Make  it possible to enter a list of subfile names at an  opening  menu, 
with one line of descriptive text, as in Dirfiles.

3)  Make it possible to	access any of these subfiles,  and there enter text. 
It need	not have word-wrap,  but basic editing capacity	would be useful. How 
about  finding a way to	incorporate Vdo.com as the editing-arm of  the	text 
database?  It is only 6-8k. Or perhaps NOTEFILE	can permit access to Vdo via 
a  Run (R) function,  as in Wordstar.  That way it could run other  relevant 
utilities  like Find or Free Filer.  That would give the program  elementary 
database capacities.

Once the individual NOTEFILE database had been entered,	it would provide the 
list   of all the subfiles at the menu.   Other database  programs  operate  
in  much this way,   but the key difference is that  NOTEFILE  would permit 
unstructured  text  entry  of any kind.   (Eventually there should  be  the 
capacity  to draw  up  some kind of structured fields,   if   desired,   as  
in  Notebook    or  Datastar.)  Dbase2 might offer the most natural way  to  
write this program,   but something like a Turbo Pascal compiled file would  
really  be   preferable,   a text  database that might get as much  use  as 
Wordstar  for  those  in  the no-man's  land  between word  processors  and 
databases.   In  any  case,    stick   to  Wordstar  commands and  make  it 
version	of Vdo.

4)  These  subfiles should be able to hold at least three  pages  of  text--
preferably something more like ten pages.

5)  Other  database capacities,	 such as the ability to	sort and  print	 out 
fields,	 could be improved on in later versions	of the program,	 as well  as 
expanding the editing tools.

				     *

			  PURPOSE OF NOTEFILE.COM

Many  editing  projects	require	working	on a cluster of	 related  files.  In 
fact,  this is the best	kind of	outlining of all,  where you can create	 10, 
20,  or	 even more categories (i.e.,  subfiles),   all listed at the opening 
menu as	with dirfiles,	where they can be quickly accessed for data entry or 
scanning.   It seems to	me that	20 subfiles would be a minimum for a  single 
file,  but  a total of 30 or 35	subfiles that could be created would be	much 
more useful,  if it is necessary to set	a limit	on the number of subfiles at 
all.In any case,  each subfile could be expanded as needed and the more this 
becomes possible,  the more useful and used the program will be.

				     *

When I am doing	research,  information comes to	me in snatches.	 Once I	have 
entered	a NOTEFILE database,  I	would like to be able to access	any subfile, 
enter the information, and close it again, then	have quick access to another 
file  within  that text	database.   It should be possible to go	back to	 the 
opening	 menu  by  saving the individual subfile or  abandoning	 the  edited 
version	 of it.	 That way things won't be slowed down too much as  the  text 
file grows larger. Exiting one subfile should return to	the main menu, where 
another	subfile	can be accessed, or the	entire program exited--with a built-
in save,  if possible. It would	be great if the	individual NOTEFILE database 
could  be as large as the diskspace,  but it would still be practical if  it 
were  at least  able to expand beyond the size of the program itself  by  at 
least 40K and hopefully even more. If the program were no more than 20 or so 
K,  then the program and 40K or so of text could fit into memory,  making it 
possible to make between files very quickly.  However, it might be better to 
have  the larger file capacity,   even at the expense of slowing the program  
down.   In  any   case   we  would have a cross between  a  word  processing  
program  and  a  database,  a category into which a lot  of  text  and  note 
material falls.
				     *

If you decide to take a	crack at writing this program (for CP/M, of course!) 
please	upload	to the St.  Louis Kaypro  board, 314-821-0638,  or the local 
Epson board, 314-961-4594, where I will be sure to find it.  Even if you are 
not  a  programer,   if you like the idea and want such  a  program,  please 
upload  this  note wherever you can,  and hopefully it  will fall  into  the 
right hands.  I am freely putting this idea into  the public domain, and all 
I ask is that it be kept there, where CP/M lives.

Does anybody know what 8080 assemblers might be available for
porting on a 4.2 or sys V system?  Lex/Yacc or C scripts are ok.

Also, are there any that have "macro" capability?  I need source,
because this will probably be going on a 6/32 machine.

Please respond by mail.

KAYPRO owners should be interested in a frequently-occurring
harware problem, and in a simple, virtually no-cost cost fix.

    .   I learned about the fix from Ray Kester of
        Springfield, VA, to whom I'd been referred for help
        in fixing the KAYPRO my son uses in college.

    .   Ray suggested that before I bring him the unit, I
        check what he had discovered to be a very frequent
        problem on KAYPROs.

    .   Ray's advice was right on the money - I pass his
        advice to the net so that others can benefit.


THE SYMPTOM: The KAYPRO won't work.  The screen may light up and
the "Insert Disk ..." message may appear, but the 'A' Drive
light won't go on and the computer won't boot.


THE PROBLEM: Especially on units older than the '84' series, the
male connector on the power-supply board was not well soldered
to the foil.

    .   Over time, one of the ten connector pins may
        separate electrically from the foil.

    .   The disconnect may be intermittent or
        load-dependent - the presence of all voltages does
        NOT prove that the problem does not exist.


THE FIX: Obvious, but here it is step-by-step.

    .   The power supply board is mounted on the rear panel
        of the unit, below and at right angles to the main
        board.

    .   Remove the cover (ten screws).  Unplug the ten-pin
        connector from the power supply board and note its
        orientation.

    .   Remove the four screws that hold the power supply
        board to the rear panel, slip off the cable loops
        that may be attached to the power supply's plastic
        'legs', and take out the board.  (It helps also to
        remove the diagonal strut that is attached to the
        bottom and rear panels for rigidity.)

    .   Using a small-wattage (15-25w) soldering iron and
        ROSIN core solder, firmly connect each of the ten
        connector pins to the foil (by flowing solder from
        the pin to the foil).

       ..  The printed circuit board is quite sturdy and
           the connections to the board cover a large area.

       ..  Even those who have never soldered a circuit
           board should be able to do this task after
           asking someone with experience for general
           advice on soldering circuit boards.

    .   Reinstall the power supply board and plug in the
        connector (carefully check the connector's
        orientation).


That's it.

                             ###

Where does this program exist on public domain files?

The MicroVAX floppy drives are RX50's, the same as used in the Rainbow.
We have a version of an old Unix program which read 8" CP/M disks from
the console floppy of a VAX, but are having a hard time converting it
to work for the 5.25" RX50's.  Most of the problem stems from the face
that we can't get good documentation on interleave factors, reserved
tracks/sectors, etc. used by the MicroVAX.  If anyone has tackled this
problem, i would really like to hear from you.  i hate looking at raw
dumps.

NetLandians,
Does anyone out there have a nice piece of code (C, preferably) that
converts between geographic coordinates (latitude/longitude) and UTM
(military grid) coordinates?

I have a couple of pieces of stuff, but nothing very clean and would have
to be converted into C.

Thanks in advance.

Hi all,


I'm looking for several peices of information:

I'm starting a financial affairs/venture capitalists bulletin board at home; I
am looking for good public domain bulletin board software for an APPLE IIe in
both CPM and DOS or PRODOS.

Any recommendations on regular (store bought) CPM or other bulletin board
packages for the APPLE IIe would be appreciated; send ANY comments, advice, or
experience trivia directly to me; I will summarize all to the nets.

ANY person who has direct experience setting up or running a BB would be
especially appreciated.




PART II


I was looking through a DAK catalog recently, and saw a MODEM PHONE (computer-
ized yellow pages they called it).  As part of the sales promo, they said they
had the address of a company that sold a directory of hundreds of bulletin
boards:   does anyone know what this company is and how to find them??

Anyone having lists or directories of bulletin boards, or who knows of a good
bulletin board - pleas write.



Thanks a lot,

Trevor O. McCarthy

Tom:
There are a couple of bulletin board lists available
on Simtel20 through FTP. The path is pd:<CPM.RCPM>
the major file is PBBS02A.LBR (a library file) with most
of the bbs's listed. The other (I'm guessing from over a year ago)
is PBBS-SUP.LBR ( a suplament to the above?) and for the RBBS type
systems RCPM-UG.PRN I assume is the one for RBBS type systems that
was split from the PBBS list last year. RCPMBGNR.DQC should be
of help also. Hope this helps, I haven't used these files for at
least a year so they may have changed the rules since then but
I think that this directory is where you'll find what you want.
If I can help further please contact me. shawn@acc.arpa

                What's the Word on the Z-System?

                               by

              Richard Conn and the Staff of Echelon



   Questions most asked about Z-System (ZCPR3 and ZRDOS):

      1. Is ZCPR3 hard to bring up on my computer?  What
         are my options?

      2. How much memory does a Z-System take?

      3. Do I have to have a hard disk to run the Z-System?
         How much disk space is needed?

      4. How can I find out more about the Z-System?

   Answers and some basic facts are presented herein.

                  QUESTION 1: Bringing up ZCPR3

     -->  1. Is ZCPR3 hard to bring up on my computer?  What
             are my options?

                             ANSWER

If you try to bring up ZCPR3 manually (following the installation 
instructions   in  ZCPR3:  The  Manual),  the  answer   is   yes.  
Experience in assembly-language programming is necessary.  Source 
code to your BIOS is necessary.  An understanding of CP/M and  Z-
System concepts is necessary.
     However,  you may not have to bring ZCPR3  manually.   There 
are options...

                   ZCPR3 Installation Options

OPTIONS
     Your basic options are:
          1) Manual Installation
             o no cost (download the software)
             o complex with many options
             o requires knowledge of assembly language
          2) Automatic Installation (Auto-Install)
             o commercial products:
                 Z3-DOT-COM (includes all help files and
                  all utilities in COM file form)    $ 99.00
                 Z3-DOT-COM (without utilities)      $ 49.95
                 Z-COM (full Z3-DOT-COM with ZRDOS)  $119.00
                 ZRDOS (CP/M BDOS Replacement)       $ 49.50
                 ZRDOS+ (ZRDOS with Public Dirs)     $ 59.50
             o write or call Echelon for current prices
          3) Pre-installed for specific systems
             o soon to be released
             o write or call Echelon for availability/prices
             o target installations:
                       Ampro          Kaypro
                       Eagle          Morrow

                       Heath/Zenith   Micromint SB180
          4) User Groups
             o major user groups often have complete ZCPR3
             o examples:
                          First Osborne user's Group (FOG)
                          Tampa Bay Kaypro User's Group

     QUESTION 2: How Much Memory is Taken Up by a Z-System?

     -->  2. How much memory does a Z-System take?

                             ANSWER

A  Z-System can take up a lot of memory, but it can also take  as 
little as 1K, depending on how it's installed.
     I  have  run the following programs in  a  full-up  Z-System 
(which  takes 5K more than a similar CP/M system), and they  have 
worked well for my applications:
                 dBase II              BDS C
                 WordStar              C/80
                   SpellStar           Pascal/MT+
                   MailMerge           MultiPlan
                   StarIndex           ASM, MAC, M80, ZAS
                 MBASIC                Z-MSG
                 CBASIC2
     There  are  some programs which hog so much  TPA  that  they 
can't run under my full-up Z-System, but I don't use them or need 
them for my applications.
     The  impact on memory is really not that significant if  you 
look at a true picture...

---------      -------------       -------------  -------------
  1.5K           7K = 10.9%          8K = 12.5%    12K = 18.8%
  2.5K           8K = 12.5%          9K = 14.1%    13K = 20.3%
  3.5K           9K = 14.1%         10K = 15.6%    14K = 21.9%
  4.5K          10K = 15.6%         11K = 17.2%    15K = 23.4%
  5.5K          11K = 17.2%         12K = 18.8%    16K = 25.0%

     Note:  nK = p% indicates the size of the system in K (BIOS + 
BDOS  +  CPR) and the percentage of the total memory taken up  by 
the operating system.   In my case,  I am running a Maximum ZCPR3 
with  a 5.5K BIOS overhead,  so this leaves a 48K TPA (64K  - 16K 
System) which expands to 50K if the program overlays ZCPR3.   All 
my programs, including WordStar and dBASE II continue to run, and 
I have full ZCPR3 features.
     Even  with this argument,  people will still ignore the vast 
gains  in  functionality and capability offered by ZCPR3  and  Z-
System  and concentrate on their single-minded fixation with  TPA 
(for  reasons no one has adequately explained to me).   A  future 
ZCPR3 release,  ZCPRB3, will offer a banked memory system with at 
least a 60K TPA (now,  that should make them happy).  Note that I 
am not moving to a banked system on their account,  but as a step 
toward multitasking--something I really want.
.foQuestion 3: How Much Disk Space is Used?                   Page #


    QUESTION 3: Must I have a hard disk to run the Z-System?

     -->  3. Do I have to have a hard disk to run the Z-System?
             How much disk space is needed?

                             ANSWER

No.
     The Z-System runs better on a hard disk...because everything 
runs  better on a hard disk.  Also, a hard disk runs better on  a 
Z-System  because of all the programs and features which  support 
the hard disk:

          Named directories with passwords
          Public directories under ZRDOS+
          Paths
          Shells
          Special commands, like CD (Change Directory)

     Most Z-System features are practical regardless of the  disk 
used.
     The following shows some disk configurations, from a full-up 
hard disk (over 1 megabyte of support files) to a minimum  system 
(less than 40K-bytes of support files)...

     QUESTION 4: How can I find out more about the Z-System?

     -->  4. How can I find out more about the Z-System?

                             ANSWER

There are lots of ways:

          o talking to Z-System users
          o magazines
          o books
          o user's groups
          o Echelon Newsletters (Z-NEWS)
          o Echelon, Inc.

     While  the  first  documentation on the  Z-System  was  very 
technical,  Echelon  and its friends are producing more and  more 
user-oriented  documentation which is aimed at the  non-technical 
user.   Many,  many magazine articles have also come out with the 
intention  of aiding the non-technical user in understanding what 
the Z-System does for him.
     The documentation is abundant...

                     Z-System Documentation

     o Lots of magazine articles (BYTE, Profiles, Remark, etc.)
     o Books and Newsletters (Echelon has current prices)

Subject:  Good Sort Program Needed


I need a sort program with these features:

	handles variable-length records
	records are CR/LF terminated
	fields within records are delimited by arbitrary character - in
this case a comma
	file is large - will not fit in memory - must sort disk file.

I believe I went through the PD archives thoroughly without finding one
although SORTV came close.  Have I missed one?  Does anyone have any
other ideas?

Send mail or post, as you wish.

Thanks,

This file does NOT allow you to reference a .LBR as a disk (too bad, would
be nice)...  Instead it does read all user areas of a drive, looking for
-filename entries, and adds these names to the named_dir_buffer.  This
was intended for logging in flopy drives' named directory entries
automatically.

Paul, Re your message ...

"... I noticed that each file starts with
LXI H,SYSENV ;pointer to sys env
CALL ???INIT ;init for program
and I assume that it is the address after the LXI instruction that the
install program fills in.  If this is the case then why not replace that
code with
LHLD zero_page_pointer_to_SYSENV
CALL ???INIT
this would mean that the tools could be run WITHOUT (re)installing!
It seems to me that this would be a big plus for people that have many
systems, or that load systems of different memory sizes.  A side feature
would be that you could load more than one ENV table for debugging or
what ever and just have to change ONE pointer to use the other one."

	-- Your suggestion would be nice, but there is a problem in
that there is no "free" space on page zero which would provide two
bytes (or even one byte for a page address) that can be guaranteed to
be free in all CP/M implementations ... note that the "standard"
external path location is a variable since some implementations use
this area for BIOS constants; take heart, tho, for in ZCPR 3.3 (the
new version which will go into beta test soon), there are many radical
differencences, one being that the tools do NOT require installation
(the address of the ENV is passed in HL from the ZCPR 3.3).

"Also I was wondering why there was a POINTER -in- the ENV_table that points
to the WHEEL_byte instead of the actual WHEEL_byte itself?  This would save
one byte in the ENV and free up the zero_page entry for something else
(maybe the pointer to sys_env), and it would also save programs from having
to index to get to the wheel_pointer then index to wheel from the pointer.
I thought that maybe this was because many programs have the wheel address
"hard-wired-in" but can't think of any that use wheel that don't allow
you to change the address...  This change would also mean that this would
no longer be necessary for Z-systems, while everyone else could still
patch as always."

	-- Two years ago, when I completed ZCPR 3, I was concerned
with having TWO wheel bytes on a RAS (Remote Access System) - one
wheel byte which was implemented by some other user software, and one
for the ZCPR3.  With the evolution of ZCPR 3.3 into an os/comm system,
of which I have total control, this concern is gone, and ZCPR 3.3 now
has a Wheel BIT in the ENV as well as a variety of access control bits

"I sure think the idea of non-installed tools is a great hack!
So what did I miss, you're far too great a programmer to have passed this
up with out some good reason."

	-- non-installed tools are now common under ZCPR 3.3, as well
as built-in CM; you should try to come to my talks (like the one I
just gave at Trenton, which was packed) - lots of details are coming
out there and in planned articles as well as Z-News; ZCPR 3.3 forms
the basis for ZCPRB3 (Banked ZCPR3) and ZCPRM3 (Multitasking ZCPR3),
so the non-installed tools are here to stay, as well as the new CM
system and communications system attributes of the Z System

        This  file  does  NOT  allow you to reference a .LBR as a disk (too
        bad,  would  be  nice)...


It is nice ...

Note  that there *is* software which permits a .LBR file to be addressed as
a  disk.   The  version  I  have  is 2.2, but there may be a later version.
Don't  know if it is stored at SIMTEL or not.  As I recall, my version came
by way of the Meadowlark BBS in Canada.  The relevant file is LBRDSK22.LBR.
It  contains a program which implements, in CP/M 2.2, a facility similar to
the  CP/M 3.0 RSX.  This RSX "installer" is then used to instantiate an RSX
which implements the ".LBR as a disk" capability.  I am not a heavy user of
the  software,  but  I have some friends who use it all the time.  There is
some  problem  related to my hard drive BIOS/ROM (Kaypro 10) and I've never
had  the  ambition  to  track  it  down, primarily because I don't have the
source  for  the software.  My friends have machines with floppys, and they
have not had any trouble.

Subject: FIX for Sick KAYPROs
To: info-cpm@AMSAA.ARPA, info-micro@AMSAA.ARPA
Message-ID: <[MC.LCS.MIT.EDU].893728.860424.STORK>


KAYPRO owners should be interested in a frequently-occurring
harware problem, and in a simple, virtually no-cost cost fix.

    .   I learned about the fix from Ray Kester of
        Springfield, VA, to whom I'd been referred for help
        in fixing the KAYPRO my son uses in college.

    .   Ray suggested that before I bring him the unit, I
        check what he had discovered to be a very frequent
        problem on KAYPROs.

    .   Ray's advice was right on the money - I pass his
        advice to the net so that others can benefit.


THE SYMPTOM: The KAYPRO won't work.  The screen may light up and
the "Insert Disk ..." message may appear, but the 'A' Drive
light won't go on and the computer won't boot.


THE PROBLEM: Especially on units older than the '84' series, the
male connector on the power-supply board was not well soldered
to the foil.

    .   Over time, one of the ten connector pins may
        separate electrically from the foil.

    .   The disconnect may be intermittent or
        load-dependent - the presence of all voltages does
        NOT prove that the problem does not exist.


THE FIX: Obvious, but here it is step-by-step.

    .   The power supply board is mounted on the rear panel
        of the unit, below and at right angles to the main
        board.

    .   Remove the cover (ten screws).  Unplug the ten-pin
        connector from the power supply board and note its
        orientation.

    .   Remove the four screws that hold the power supply
        board to the rear panel, slip off the cable loops
        that may be attached to the power supply's plastic
        'legs', and take out the board.  (It helps also to
        remove the diagonal strut that is attached to the
        bottom and rear panels for rigidity.)

I am in a situaion where I need to develop code on an IBM-PC but the
debugged code is going to run on a custom Z80 board. I am interested
in any information relating to the following :

	1. Z80 or CP/M cards on IBM-PC.
	2. Cross-compiler or cross-assembler between 8088 and Z80.
	3. 1Mbit EPROM or EEPROM burner with interface to IBM-PC.
	4. Any development tools, software or hardware, that can help me
	   develop, download, and debug code on IBM-PC for Z80 CPU.

Thanks.

I think you're confusing "Small-C" with "Tiny-C".  Tiny-C isn't really C,
its syntax is rather different.  If I recall correctly, Tiny-C was an
interpretive language, and about the first thing even close to C on the
market for micros.  I think that it came without machine-readable media,
and you had to type in the interpreter code (but I may be completely out
of wack).  I think that it was the first package Lifeboat ever distributed.

Small-C V1.0 was written by Ron Cain, complete sources including bare-bones
8080 run-time support were published in Dr. Dobbs about 4-5 years ago.  
It's syntax was *almost* completely compatible with C (only a minor bitch 
or two - which we fixed), and it is a subset: was missing a couple
of statement types, only allowed the following declarations:
	char ...
	char *...
	char ...[]
	int ...
	int *
	int ...[]
(No structs, unions, initializers, longs, unsigneds, floats, doubles, or more
than one "indirection"), and a few other minor glitches (eg: missing all
of the assignment operators except "=" etc.).

It was a fairly impressive achievment even so - Ron Cain had obviously
never seen a compiler before (eg: it had no true "scanner" - which would have
speeded it up rather drastically), and, inspite of the drastic subsetting,
could compile itself rather handily - on a single SSSD 8" CPM disk!

Small-C didn't optimize the output (assembler by the way) at all.  Even so,
we were rather startled to see its generated code outperforming interpretive 
BASICs by two orders of magnitude, and some commercially available (and
expensive) Pascals by a factor of 5 (this was on a 6809).  I included Small-C
into my M.Sc. thesis (on the implementation of Concurrent Euclid, and compiler
benchmarks) just for laughs - the benchmarks weren't all that bad.
A friend of mine wrote an awk-based assembler optimizer that got size gains
of %40 (and higher speed gains), still without even folding constant 
expressions.

This same friend of mine and I typed the sources in, and over a year or so, got
it ported and self-compiling on 8080's, 6809's, pdp11's, vaxes and a
few other machines I can't remember.  It was neat - only took about 8 hours
of work to port to a new machine once you understood how the code generator
worked.  My friend, inspired by playing around with the guts, went on
to reimplement it completely using proper compiler techniques and "heavy"
optimization.  [PT?  Are you listening?  Or, have you forgotten CPM 
altogether?  How about uploading SCC V3 one of these days - if you can
find it...)

Since then I've extended a version (8080, 6809, pdp11 and vax targets) so
as to add all of the statements that were missing, plus ensure that all
operators were implemented plus a lot of other things.  I've often
thought about adding structs and initializers etc., but I'm afraid that
without optimization the durn thing won't fit in 56k.  Further, I've
"disconnected" the compiler's front end from machine-dependencies - I
have an archive containing the compiler's front end binaries, you merely 
have to link in a different code generator (about 9K of source) to retarget
the compiler to a different machine.  We used to do cross-compile the
compiler, download the resultant assembler to the target, assemble and link, 
and voila!

It's a great compiler to cut your teeth on - accompanied by a compiler
construction book it makes a great learning experience.

About 1 1/2 years later, someone else published in Dr. Dobbs a new version 
of Small-C (called Small-C V2.0) that had been greatly extended.  However, 
V2.0 version is a subset of what I have now.

During this time Dr. Dobbs published several C programs intended for
use with this compiler, including a full-screen editor.

Since this time, however, with the availability of full-blown C compilers
really cheap, most people have been drifting away from Small-C.

Regarding Q/C and MIX-C: unless my memory is completely faulty, *both*
of these compilers *are* (or were) Small-C, but greatly extended.  I'm 
absolutely certain Q/C is (which is why it's so cheap and why source 
is released).  Both of them have been extended at least as far as 
structs/unions, but not floating point (I think).  I would imagine that
they don't optimize much either.

If there's sufficient interest, I'll post the sources to the whole
shebang on mod.sources.  It may not be the best compiler (I'd recommend
something better for serious work - even so, I know of at least one company
that really uses it in their products), but it's fun to play with.  And,
if you *need* a "compiler" on a new machine, it's the fastest way to go.

I am *very* interested in the source to this.  If there is not sufficient
interest to post them, I would appreciate it if you would email the

Dr. Dobbs' now offers the "latest and greatest" Small-C source on disk
for around $30. And the documentation in book form for even less.

New version has all assignment operators, and multiple indirection.

Does so now - with a pee-hole optimizer compile-time option.

Q/C has an optional MATHPAK which extends the spec to include floating point.
It does handle structures, but not unions (I think), and definately not bit
fields.

MIX is a full blown - K&R C, structs, unions, floating point - the whole
shebang.  It is not a fast compiler, nor does it produce very tight code,
but it is far and away the cheapest full C compiler on the market.

I would appreciate recommendations for a good word processing program
and a compatible spelling checker for CP/M. The program must be
configurable for a Zenith Z19 (Heath H19) terminal and an Okidata ML92
printer. It would be nice if it would support both the "correspondence
quality" and the standard print modes of the ML92.

Although I have CP/M 2.2, I will probably use Cromemco's CDOS, so CP/M
1.3 compatibility would be a plus. The CPU is a Z80, and the disks are
dual 8inch with 1.2 megabytes each (no hard disk).

Ease of use would be the most important feature after compatibility with
my equipment. Cost would be next. For anything very fancy or
complicated, I would expect to resort to an embedded command formatter
(I'll take recommendations on those also).

I am not very fond of Wordstar. I don't think it carries as much
information in its document files as it ought to. WS can't seem to
decide whether its a word processor, text editor, or an embedded command
text formatter. However, if everyone thinks WS would be best, I might
concede. That is, if someone can tell me where to buy a verion of WS for
CP/M at a reasonable price.

I would also appreciate pointers to reliable vendors of the software.

Thanks in advance!

I am trying to  convert a Turbo Pascal Kermit that was written for
CPM-80 & MS-DOS to CPM-86.  The communications end of it is no problem,
I have that from an earlier Kermit I converted for my system.  The problem
is a seemingly simple directory search.   This starts off with BDOS function
17.  It should be no big deal to change from CPM-80 to CPM-86, right ?
Just change everything to put in SEGments in the right places and it should
all work fine.  Well, that doesn't work.  On the first try (an automatic
search for KERMIT.DEF) the RESULT is always 255, whether or not the file
exists.  On the next try, whether for a real file or not, wildcard or not,
I get a BDOS error on D: Select, function 17 (which is the function I was
trying at least...)
I don't know what I am doing wrong.  This should be very simple, even
though I have never tried this before.  When I run this, the first byte
(drive) = 0, the name and type are set correctly, and I set the extent
byte = 0 (which is what the manual says to do).  I don't see what else
I need to do.  Please help !

*EVERY* case, they have been thouroughly displeased with the products and the
service offered by DAK.  The company will not make any effort to correct 
problems, they will lie to you about schedules and anything else.

   Stay *AWAY* from them!

Subject: Programming a Xerox 820-II
Message-ID: <"MS11(5146)+GLXLIB0(4)-4" 12202716025.15.443.11103 at MARLBORO.DEC.COM>

I have an old XEROX 820-II which I am using for packet radio purposes.
Right now I am using it as a dumb terminal, running SMARTERM, but I
would like to make it more clever.  To do this, I have to know how
to program the I/O port, and possibly how to handle interrupts from
the keyboard.  I would like to use DTR/DTS on the serial port.  I'd
prefer to do it in TURBO Pascal, but assembler is acceptable.  Can
someone tell me how to do this (or does someone have a code fragment
I can look at)?

			Thanks,

This may be true for the people you know, but I've ordered 7 or 8 times
from them and been *generally* pleased.  The merchandise isn't HIGHEST
quality, but it doesn't claim to be... it claims to be neat-o gee-whiz
which it usually is.  The one time I had a problem with something
(I just didn't like it) I returned it and was sent a check very promptly.

Given ANY mail-order place, a certain number of people are going to have
trouble.  The trick is figuring out if that number is a significantly
large number.  Maybe your friends have been extra-unlucky.  Maybe I've
been extra lucky.  Hard to tell with just two examples.  You might
check with the BBB, usually they'll have something to say about any
company that has had significant complaints made against it.  Everyone
I know who has dealt with DAK seems to think they're OK.

I guess I am the exception to the rule, I bought two of the hands of
communicators from them about 6 months ago. They arrived on schedule
and in perfect shape. A month later the microphone went out on one,
I called them up they said send it back, I did and three weeks later
I had a new unit. So much for statistics I guess.

Hi all:

Recently I sent out a message concerning DAK and a Modem Phone, and Bulletin
Boards.  I got back a lot of responses about DAK and how good or bad they
were.

I must have asked my question wrong.  The company I rquested information about
was NOT DAK, but the company that DAK's promo on the modem phone mentions.
The ad for the modem phone says that DAK will send the name of a company that
sells a major Bulletin Board directory (if you buy their modem phone).


What I wanted was information about the company that printed the directory,
and where I could get it, not about DAK itself...sorry for the mix-up.

Does anybody Know the name of this company?

Thanks,

Trevor O. McCarthy

    Two years ago I bought an ink-jet printer from DAK for under $200.00
and have been *THOROUGHLY SATISFIED*.  Change EVERY to n-1; n < innumerable.

have any information. Many thanks in advance

Hello NetLand -

     Received DAK's flyer in the mail the other day and saw their ad
for the "walks like a duck..." 1200 baud modem.  Has anyone purchased
one of these things?  How about a comment or two?

I don't know of a standard driver for this combination, but it should be a
trivial hack to CP/M-68K.  If you do not have the BIOS to change the console
driver, it is still fairly trivial to put a RSX into the system which will
intercept all the console (display) writes and send them to your video board.


Drop me a line if I can help.
