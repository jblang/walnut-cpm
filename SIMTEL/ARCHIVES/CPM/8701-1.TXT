Subject: Kermit
Message-ID: <M1987$000008.359000KATZM.MKATZ@UMD2.UMD.EDU>

I finally have Kermit working correctly on an Altos 586 running MPM-86.
It's not perfect, but its almost done and file transfers work fine.
I got it to work  by using the XIOS functions 4 and 5 which correspond
to CPM-86 BIOS functions 6 and 7 - punch output and reader input.  The
MPM-86 manual says that these functions are needed in the XIOS for
compatibility with CPM-86, but that they should do nothing and return (which
is what the normal Altos 586 XIOS does).  I think it would have made
more sense for DRI to have either implemented the punch/reader to be
used by communications programs or trapped the calls in the BDOS since the
BDOS has to translate them (from  6 & 7 to 4 & 5) for direct BIOS  calls
anyway.  I got the program to work by making the punch output go to
the second printer (which is actually printer 1 since they start at 0).
I made reader input do one of two things - return the status of the port
or return  a character from the port, depending on the value of CX as
passed through the BIOS descriptor.  All of these functions set the port
to the second printer port and then call conin, conout, or const to
do the real work, since all the ports are the same on an Altos (the XIOS
already used conout for list output).  In order to get mutual exclusion,
I didn't have to use any fancy queues, just have the program attach
to printer 1 and MPM handles  the rest.
If anyone  is interested in this program, please let me know and
I can send you the machine specific kermit file (most of the kermit
I used is the same for all CPM-86 machines) and the portion of the XIOS
that I wrote.
Now that I have this working, does anyone have any suggestions for a
file transfer program that includes XMODEM ?  The only limitations are
that it be written in ASM86 or Turbo Pascal for CPM-86.  I know there
are a few in the SIG/M library, but I don't know which is the "best"
one to get.

Subject: Information on SIMTEL20 public domain archives

This message is intended to give a brief overview of files stored in
the public domain archives at SIMTEL20.

     Many of the files in our archives have been compressed and/or
grouped together in a single file by using one of the utilities
available to the public domain that either SQueezes, CRUNCHes,
LiBRaries, or ARChives files.  This has been done to minimize disk
storage requirements and also to minimize download time.

     These processed files are specially named with a filetype and can
be identified by the last 3 letters of a filename after the "." that
signifies the conversion.  These are:

        .ARK   for CP/M files archived (same as MS-DOS "ARC").
        .LBR   for files libraried.
        .?Q?   for squeezed files (middle letter is a Q).
        .?Z?   for crunched files (middle letter is a Z).

     A library is a group of files collected together into one file in
such a way that the individual files may be recovered intact.  A
library file can be identified by the "LBR" as the extent of the file
name.  LU (Library Utility) is a CP/M utility used to maintain
libraries of files.  LU does not perform any compression.  Because of
this, most people will squeeze or crunch files before adding them to a
library if they want to save space.  If you want to remove the
component files (members) from a LBR file, you should have a copy of
LU.COM or other LBR extractor utility.  At the end of this document is
a list of the programs available for that function with libraries.

     Recently, popular CP/M Public Domain software files and
information files are being distributed using ARCHIVE files.  Archive
files are similar to library (LBR) files in that they take a logical
group of files and put them together in a single file.  The main
difference, is that the members of the "ARC" or "ARK" file are
automatically compressed.  The compression algorithm chosen is one of
three which will produce the smallest file.

     Archive files have been available to the MS-DOS and PC-DOS areas,
but, have been made useful in the CP/M environment with the
introduction of the "UNARC" program.  The current version is 1.4, and
is available with extensive documentation, and two executable COM
files, a 8080/8085 version and a Z80 version.  The Z80 version takes
advantage of the expanded Z80 (and equivalent) instruction set for
speed and size, and therefore is machine dependent.  There is also a
modification overlay to adapt the program to non-standard CP/M 2.2 and
3.0 operating systems, such as CP/M68k and CP/M emulators.  Programs
are available on many machines to process "ARC" files, the Atari ST,
systems running the UNIX systems, systems running MS-DOS, and CP/M.

     There currently is no CP/M utility available to make an "ARK"
file.  Archive files will be made in the MS-DOS/PC-DOS, TOPS20 or UNIX
environment.  To avoid confusion on RCP/Ms that support both MS-DOS
and CP/M callers, Archive files have a file extension of "ARK" for
CP/M software and information files.

     Some files on SIMTEL20 have been compressed, using one of the
standard public domain utilities, to minimize download time and to
save storage space.

     Files that have been compressed can be identified by the filetype
(the last 3 letters of a filename after the '.') that signifies the
compression.  These are:

        .?Q?   for Squeezed files (middle letter is a Q).
        .?Z?   for Crunched files (middle letter is a Z).

     USQ120.COM is used to unsqueeze, or expand files that have a "Q"
as the middle letter of the filetype.  Such files have been squeezed,
or compressed with SQ111.COM or similar.  These programs use Huffman
Encoding to reduce the size of the target file.  Depending on the
distribution of data in a file it can be reduced in size by 30% to 60%
by squeezing it.  If you download a file with a filetype indicating
that it is squeezed, you will need USQ120.COM to expand it before you
can use it.  There are other programs available, written in different
languages and take advantage of special hardware, but USQ120 is
8080/8085/Z80 compatible.

     Other utilities are available that have the unsqueeze coding
imbedded and function with squeezed or unsqueezed files.  There are
programs that perform file maintenance functions (NSWP), bi-directiona
display utilities (BISHOW), and string search programs, (FYNDE and
FINDU).  This method of compressing files has been used for some time
now and programs to uncompress the files are available to several
micro processors and main frame computers.

     CRUNCH uses the Lempel-Ziv-Welch (LZW) techniques.  This method
is fast and offers compression ratios around 55%.  Highest compression
is achieved with graphics data, values of 90% are typical, followed by
text, with 50%, and COM files around 20%.  This method is new to the
CP/M environment.  See CRUNCH23.LBR for the Z80 CRUNCH and UNCRunch
programs.  See FCRNCH11.LBR for the 8080/8085 and V20 CRUNCH and
UNCRunch programs.

     Since this method of compression is relatively new, the only
utilities available that processes crunched files are "typer"
utilities such as TYPELZW, TYPEQZ, and LT, which also type members of
libraries and squeezed files.  If running a 8080/8085 processor, check
the documentation to determine if the utility will only process files
on systems using the Z80 processor.  Currently, there is no compatible
program for other micro processors or mainframes.

     MicroSoft BASIC programs are always saved as ASCII files (saved
with the ",A" operand).  They may than be squeezed or crunched.  This
has been done to allow them to be converted for use with other BASIC
compilers or interpreters.

     Some executable files have a file extension of "OBJ".  These are
really "COM" files that have been renamed to "OBJ" to avoid execution
on RCP/M systems.  Rename them back to "COM" for use them as commands
on your system.

   The manual says to use the non-break space; I've used the
underscore character myself on many occasions.  I recall once
seeing a patch to WordStar that caused it to also underline
spaces, but that was many years ago and I have no idea where
I saw it.  Good luck.

Subject: Query: WS continuous underline

The following is from WSUNDERL.TXT, available in our software library
as PD:<CPM.WSTAR>WSUNDERL.TQT.

           Underlining in WordStar with a Dot Matrix Printer

Here's how to set WordStar up so that it will give you continuous
underlining (rather than the broken dash kind) whenever you want it.  I
shall use WordStar 3.3 as the example (the drill for version 3.0 is
somewhat different).  What you have to do is pick out one of the Printer
Codes for which you have no use and redefine it so that it will toggle
continuous underlining on and off.  A suitable one is the ^PY that
WordStar provides for changing your ribbon color, which you are unlikely
to mind giving up.  And you can make the change, by running either
WINSTALL or DDT.  I'll describe the former method, because most people
probably have some acquaintance with it.  <CR> means: enter a Return.

As a safety precaution make a copy of your present WordStar file, and
then work on that copy.  Then, if things go wrong, you still have your
original WordStar file safe and sound.  A simple way to do that is to
rename the file with:

A>ren oldws.com=ws.com  <CR>
A>pip ws.com=oldws.com  <CR>

Now work exclusively with WS.COM.  Start by passing through the early
screens of WINSTALL until you reach the Installation Menu, where you
again choose between two methods of achieving your goal.  I shall
describe the shorter and quicker one.

At the Installation Menu you are invited to select one of several
letters.  Don't take any of them.  Instead do something that you are not
told about at all - hit the "+" key.

1. This will bring up a screen called "Custom Modification routine".
Hit <CR>.

2. You will be asked for a starting address.  Reply by entering the
label:

        :RIBBON     [You must start with that colon]

3. You will be told you are at address 6E3h.  ["h" is not part of the
address; it indicates that the numerals, like all the numerals in this
operation, are in hexadecimal notation.]  And below will be a row of 16
numerals.  You will be asked if this is OK.  It is, so enter Y.

4. The next screen may look terrifying, if you have not been in this
sort of country before.  Not to worry.  Just follow these instructions
blindly - but with your eyes wide open, to make sure that you enter
things exactly as below.

Where the cursor is flashing enter:

        ,03   <CR>   [Put that comma in each time]
        ,1B   <CR>
        ,2D   <CR>
        ,31   <CR>
        .     <CR>   [No comma that time.  Just the period]

5. Then enter <CR> to continue, and repeat the pattern of 2.- 4. above,
but entering different values.  This time give as your starting address:

        :RIBOFF           [Don't forget that colon]

6. You will be told you are at address 6E8h.  That is OK, so type Y.

7. Now the values to be entered at the cursor are:

        ,03   <CR>
        ,1B   <CR>
        ,2D   <CR>
        ,30   <CR>
        .     <CR>

8. Next type X to leave the Modification routine.

   Then type X again to leave the Installation Menu.
   Then type A to save the changes you have made.

** NOTE **  The hexadecimal values given in 4. and 7. above are those
for Epson printers, for which the Underline Mode ON command is: <ESC>-1,
and for OFF is: <ESC>-0.  If you have a printer with different ON and
OFF commands, the hexadecimal values will have to be changed
correspondingly.

The job is almost done, and you are now back at the A> or B>, or
wherever you started.  From now on, when writing a file use ^PY in the
way that you previously used ^PS, and in the printed version of what you
have written the expressions that you marked will have continuous
underlining below them.  At the same time, you can go on using ^PS just
as you do now whenever you want to produce the broken dash kind of
underlining.

There is just one more thing you have to remember when you are using
this method of underlining.  Dot matrix printers are very literal
creatures, and when they are in Underline Mode they underline
everything, including spaces between words, and also the blank space in
the left margin.  If you want "The Wind in the Willows" (the whole title
continuously underlined), "^PYThe Wind in the Willows^PY" will give it
to you.  If you want "The Wind in the Willows" (each word separately
underlined), you will have to write it as "^PYThe^PY ^PYWind^PY ^PYin^PY
^PYthe^PY ^PYWillows^PY".

And if, when you are using the first way, the book title happens to run
over from the end of one line on your screen to the beginning of the
next, in the printed version the blank space in the left margin of that
second line will get underlined too.  You can prevent that by putting in
a closing ^PY at the end of the first line and a new opening ^PY at the
beginning of the next.  But it is a nuisance to have to remember that on
each occasion, and there is a cleaner way that I have been using for a
long time, that I recommend.  It consists simply of telling WordStar
that you are not going to have any left margin at all, and then secretly
telling your printer to put it back again.

1. You remove the margin from WordStar by reducing the Page Offset to
zero with the dot command: .PO 0.  If it is worth your while, you could
change your default Page Offset to that; and then you wouldn't have to
think about it each time.

2. To get the printer to put the margin back again you have to run a
very short file in Basic before giving the command to print.  I call the
file LMARG.BAS; and this is all it consists of:

10 LPRINT CHR$(27)"l"CHR$(10)
20 SYSTEM

If you don't know what that means, it doesn't matter.  It tells the
printer to put in a left margin of 10 characters.  And if you don't know
how to write and save that to disk in Basic, get a friend who does know
to do it for you.

Make sure that you have MBASIC.COM and LMARG.BAS on the same disk as
your WordStar files.  Now, when you have finished writing your file in
WordStar and are ready to print it, first turn on the printer and then
from the Opening Menu choose:

"R Run a program" and enter: "mbasic lmarg  <CR>".  The Basic program
will run, set the margin on the printer and return you to the Opening
Screen where you give the command P and start printing as usual.

That may all sound very complicated.  But remember that you have to do
it only once.  Thereafter, whenever you want to print anything and have
the underlining (or some of it) continuous, all you have to do is: (i)
to insert the .PO 0 command at the beginning of your file.

  (ii) to enclose the expressions to be continuously underlined within a
^PY . . . .^PY command.

  (iii) when you are ready to print, to give those final R and P
commands.

If you are satisfied with the results, you can delete your old WordStar
file (OLDWS.COM).  If you are not satisfied delete the one you have been
playing around with (WS.COM), and rename OLDWS.COM as WS.COM.  You will
have lost nothing but some time and trouble.

Postscript.  To any of you who are using one of those new-fangled MS-DOS
Kaypros: the WINSTALL procedure for you is exactly the same as that I
have described for the CP/M version, except that the starting addresses
you will be given for RIBBON and RIBOFF are different (they are 793h and
798h).  All the steps you have to take are just as I have given them.

Subject:  Kaypro 4 info needed
To:  info-cpm@AMSAA.ARPA
Message-ID:  <870105030158.455578@DOCKMASTER.ARPA>

I am trying to help a friend with a Kaypro 4 to change a communications
program to use the serial printer port instead of the serial rs232 modem
port.  Can anyone point me to information on how to access the printer
serial port directly (i.e., port addresses,etc.)?  Is the serial printer
port initialized and accessed in the same way that the serial rs232
(modem) port is accessed?

Please respond to me directly, and if there is enough response, I will

I've used the Software Toolworks C compiler for a while and while
it does push the arguments to functions in reverse order (like the
Small-c compiler), it does document this.  I used the compiler to
write filters and some comunications programs (it does allow
#asm inline assembly).  It got the job done for me and the
price was right.

   The manual says to use the non-break space; I've used the
underscore character myself on many occasions.  I recall once
seeing a patch to WordStar that caused it to also underline
spaces, but that was many years ago and I have no idea where
I saw it.  Good luck.

Hello all,

I am looking for the latest release of CP/M 3.0 for the Commodore 128.
Commodore does not supply it here in Holland so I trying it here.
The latest version supports the serial IO and you can access a RAMdisk??

Where can I find info about the differences of the several releases
of this implementation of CP/M 3.0??

Thanks in advance

I finally have Kermit working correctly on an Altos 586 running MPM-86.
It's not perfect, but its almost done and file transfers work fine.
I got it to work  by using the XIOS functions 4 and 5 which correspond
to CPM-86 BIOS functions 6 and 7 - punch output and reader input.  The
MPM-86 manual says that these functions are needed in the XIOS for
compatibility with CPM-86, but that they should do nothing and return (which
is what the normal Altos 586 XIOS does).  I think it would have made
more sense for DRI to have either implemented the punch/reader to be
used by communications programs or trapped the calls in the BDOS since the
BDOS has to translate them (from  6 & 7 to 4 & 5) for direct BIOS  calls
anyway.  I got the program to work by making the punch output go to
the second printer (which is actually printer 1 since they start at 0).
I made reader input do one of two things - return the status of the port
or return  a character from the port, depending on the value of CX as
passed through the BIOS descriptor.  All of these functions set the port
to the second printer port and then call conin, conout, or const to
do the real work, since all the ports are the same on an Altos (the XIOS
already used conout for list output).  In order to get mutual exclusion,
I didn't have to use any fancy queues, just have the program attach
to printer 1 and MPM handles  the rest.
If anyone  is interested in this program, please let me know and
I can send you the machine specific kermit file (most of the kermit
I used is the same for all CPM-86 machines) and the portion of the XIOS
that I wrote.
Now that I have this working, does anyone have any suggestions for a
file transfer program that includes XMODEM ?  The only limitations are
that it be written in ASM86 or Turbo Pascal for CPM-86.  I know there
are a few in the SIG/M library, but I don't know which is the "best"
one to get.

Subject: Information on SIMTEL20 public domain archives

This message is intended to give a brief overview of files stored in
the public domain archives at SIMTEL20.

     Many of the files in our archives have been compressed and/or
grouped together in a single file by using one of the utilities
available to the public domain that either SQueezes, CRUNCHes,
LiBRaries, or ARChives files.  This has been done to minimize disk
storage requirements and also to minimize download time.

     These processed files are specially named with a filetype and can
be identified by the last 3 letters of a filename after the "." that
signifies the conversion.  These are:

        .ARK   for CP/M files archived (same as MS-DOS "ARC").
        .LBR   for files libraried.
        .?Q?   for squeezed files (middle letter is a Q).
        .?Z?   for crunched files (middle letter is a Z).

     A library is a group of files collected together into one file in
such a way that the individual files may be recovered intact.  A
library file can be identified by the "LBR" as the extent of the file
name.  LU (Library Utility) is a CP/M utility used to maintain
libraries of files.  LU does not perform any compression.  Because of
this, most people will squeeze or crunch files before adding them to a
library if they want to save space.  If you want to remove the
component files (members) from a LBR file, you should have a copy of
LU.COM or other LBR extractor utility.  At the end of this document is
a list of the programs available for that function with libraries.

     Recently, popular CP/M Public Domain software files and
information files are being distributed using ARCHIVE files.  Archive
files are similar to library (LBR) files in that they take a logical
group of files and put them together in a single file.  The main
difference, is that the members of the "ARC" or "ARK" file are
automatically compressed.  The compression algorithm chosen is one of
three which will produce the smallest file.

     Archive files have been available to the MS-DOS and PC-DOS areas,
but, have been made useful in the CP/M environment with the
introduction of the "UNARC" program.  The current version is 1.4, and
is available with extensive documentation, and two executable COM
files, a 8080/8085 version and a Z80 version.  The Z80 version takes
advantage of the expanded Z80 (and equivalent) instruction set for
speed and size, and therefore is machine dependent.  There is also a
modification overlay to adapt the program to non-standard CP/M 2.2 and
3.0 operating systems, such as CP/M68k and CP/M emulators.  Programs
are available on many machines to process "ARC" files, the Atari ST,
systems running the UNIX systems, systems running MS-DOS, and CP/M.

     There currently is no CP/M utility available to make an "ARK"
file.  Archive files will be made in the MS-DOS/PC-DOS, TOPS20 or UNIX
environment.  To avoid confusion on RCP/Ms that support both MS-DOS
and CP/M callers, Archive files have a file extension of "ARK" for
CP/M software and information files.

     Some files on SIMTEL20 have been compressed, using one of the
standard public domain utilities, to minimize download time and to
save storage space.

     Files that have been compressed can be identified by the filetype
(the last 3 letters of a filename after the '.') that signifies the
compression.  These are:

        .?Q?   for Squeezed files (middle letter is a Q).
        .?Z?   for Crunched files (middle letter is a Z).

     USQ120.COM is used to unsqueeze, or expand files that have a "Q"
as the middle letter of the filetype.  Such files have been squeezed,
or compressed with SQ111.COM or similar.  These programs use Huffman
Encoding to reduce the size of the target file.  Depending on the
distribution of data in a file it can be reduced in size by 30% to 60%
by squeezing it.  If you download a file with a filetype indicating
that it is squeezed, you will need USQ120.COM to expand it before you
can use it.  There are other programs available, written in different
languages and take advantage of special hardware, but USQ120 is
8080/8085/Z80 compatible.

     Other utilities are available that have the unsqueeze coding
imbedded and function with squeezed or unsqueezed files.  There are
programs that perform file maintenance functions (NSWP), bi-directiona
display utilities (BISHOW), and string search programs, (FYNDE and
FINDU).  This method of compressing files has been used for some time
now and programs to uncompress the files are available to several
micro processors and main frame computers.

     CRUNCH uses the Lempel-Ziv-Welch (LZW) techniques.  This method
is fast and offers compression ratios around 55%.  Highest compression
is achieved with graphics data, values of 90% are typical, followed by
text, with 50%, and COM files around 20%.  This method is new to the
CP/M environment.  See CRUNCH23.LBR for the Z80 CRUNCH and UNCRunch
programs.  See FCRNCH11.LBR for the 8080/8085 and V20 CRUNCH and
UNCRunch programs.

     Since this method of compression is relatively new, the only
utilities available that processes crunched files are "typer"
utilities such as TYPELZW, TYPEQZ, and LT, which also type members of
libraries and squeezed files.  If running a 8080/8085 processor, check
the documentation to determine if the utility will only process files
on systems using the Z80 processor.  Currently, there is no compatible
program for other micro processors or mainframes.

     MicroSoft BASIC programs are always saved as ASCII files (saved
with the ",A" operand).  They may than be squeezed or crunched.  This
has been done to allow them to be converted for use with other BASIC
compilers or interpreters.

     Some executable files have a file extension of "OBJ".  These are
really "COM" files that have been renamed to "OBJ" to avoid execution
on RCP/M systems.  Rename them back to "COM" for use them as commands
on your system.

Subject: re: Commodore 128 BIOS Versions
Cc: info-cpm@AMSAA.ARPA

There were essentially 4 versions - one dated August (something or other), and
three dated 4 Dec 85, 6 Dec 85, and 8 Dec 85.  The 4 Dec 85 version was the
first to support RS-232 serial I/O; this bore a RED warning message when booted
to the effect that it was a Beta-Test release.  The 6 Dec 85 and 8 Dec 85 
versions are essentially identical, the former being released via various
BBS systems, the latter being distributed on diskette by Commodore - these both
support RS-232 serial I/O and the 1700/1750 RAM Expansion units as ramdisk M:.
There have been no further releases (actual release date of the 8 Dec 85
version was in the spring of 86.)  Along with the newer versions of the BIOS
are supplied two new BIOS specific utilities: CONF.COM which allows on-the-fly
patching of various BIOS configuration options (such as screen colors, RS-232
baud rate, keyboard sampling rate, keyclick volume, printer translation mode,
etc.); and C1571.COM which speeds up writes to the 1571 drive by bypassing
read-after-write validation.  Also of interest are releases of IMP, MEX, MODEM7,
and BYE which utilize the added "pseudo" UART port.  As a result of the method
necessary to implement the RS-232 I/O, namely running an interrupt routine at
3 times the baud rate, all of the newer versions cause the 128 CP/M to run
anywhere from 6% to 300% slower than the old August version - a rule of thumb
to avoid slow-down: set BAUD to 110 when not using the RS-232 port (it defaults
to 300); this minimizes the interrupt rate without making the keyboard slug-
gish.  The new keyboard scan routine, integrated with the RS-232 interrupt
routine, effectively eliminates all those ugly key-bounce problems common to
earlier versions - keyclick added too!

All the necessary files to update to the newest version are available on 
SIMTEL20 CP/M archives in directory PD:<CPM.C128>.  These are:

I have seen ads for FTL Modula 2 sold by Workman and Associates,
and a local BBS advertises TURBO Modula 2 by Borland, both for CP/M.

I am very impressed with TURBO Pascal, and TURBO Modula
has been rumored for years.

Does anyone have experience with, or knowledge about these or any
other Modula 2 compilers for CP/M?


Thanks in advance,

It has been several years since I have used WS but this is how I
got continuous underlining.  There are (I think) 4 user defineable
keystrokes that can be set up to generate escape sequences to the
printer.  If you have the WS installation package and your printer
has the ability to underline characters, you can easily set up one
sequence to turn on underlining, and another to turn off underlining.
They are inserted into the text the same way you now toggle the 
default bold and underline.  Sorry I cannot tell you the exact 
keystrokes to get at the user defined sequences, but I'm sure they
show up in the ^P menu.

The TOPS-20 versions of the MSDOS ARC program (based on the 5.12
source release and recent bug fixes from the Unix world) and a new
TOPS-20 version of the SQ/USQ utilities (based on the version 3
update of the SQU-PORT release) are now available from SIMTEL20.ARPA.

Both sets require the latest version of the TOPS-20 KCC C compiler
and runtimes.  For information on the availability of KCC, send a
message to INFO-KCC-REQUEST@SRI-NIC.ARPA.  Both sets also require
the files LIBT20.H and LIBT20.REL, which reside in the C: directory
here, if it is necessary to rebuild any of the programs.  Ready-to-
run executables are provided in their respective directories here.

Both sets of sources contain TOPS20 conditionals to make the changes
easy to identify.  Some of the changes may be applicable to some
Unix environments.  It should be possible to eventually merge these
changes with those versions being circulated for the Unix environments
so that one consistent set of sources can be used to build these
programs.

Sources, "make" files, and executables are in PD:<MISC.T20-ARC> and
PD:<MISC.T20-SQUSQ> here on SIMTEL20.ARPA.  Bug reports concerning
these versions should be sent via netmail directly to me.

(Sources for LIBT20 will be available at a later date, when I quit
adding features and catch up with the documentation.)

Well, there is a better way to do this. You can run install
program (wsinstall, was it? it's been a while since I used
the WS) and go to the printer configuration menu.  There, you can
set it up so that the WS command for underscore (whatever it is)
issues the control string to put your printer in underline mode.
You will have to look up the manual for your printer to see what
that string is, but that's all.  If you've never messed with tinkering
with this sort of thing, I advise you to back up WS prog's before
you do anything.

Sorry, but I don't think so.  WS does underscoring in one of two ways:

1.  By printing each character to be underscored, backspacing, and printing
    the underscore.  This is for printers that do an automatic linefeed on
    receipt of a carriage return.

2.  By printing a line of characters, issuing a <CR> without a <LF>, and then
    printing the desired underscores.  This is for printers that do *not* do
    an auto-linefeed, and it's much faster.  It's also less wear and tear on
    the printer - use it if you can.

The ^PS command is a toggle command that starts WS underscoring as I've 
described.  It does *not* issue a printer control sequence and therefore can't
be made to flick the printer into continuous-underscore mode.  Even if you
could do it, what would you do to get the printer *out* of that mode?  WS
turns off its underscoring by sensing a repeat of the ^PS command. 

It is still possible, and easy, to use two of the custom printer codes ^PQ, 
^PW, ^PE, and ^PR - run WINSTALL and select the custom printer installation 
menu item, and then select the optional user-defined codes option.  Set up one 
code to turn on underscoring and another to turn it off.  I can't do this 
because I've got every one of the WS print control commands used, even ^PY.

Or you can use the ANYCODE2 patch I described in an earlier posting - it 
allows you to insert ANY printer control sequence, even if you've got WS 
loaded up with all its options used.  I'm in the process now of sending a 
softcopy of ANYCODE2 and its documentation to Keith Petersen to be added to 
the SIMTEL20 archives.  ANYCODE2 is a little more difficult to set up, but it 
gives you incredible versatility, and it's easy to use once set up.

CRCKK31.LBR.1			BINARY	 32768  9CB1H

This is the improved version of CRCKK that I promised a few weeks ago.
The changes are pretty much along the line I mentioned in my note,
(with the -u option now "simulating" UNIX by ignoring CR's and using
CTL-Z for EOF).

However, I have made other improvements as well, but these are
"hidden" in my compiler who's croot.c and blkio.asm modules I have
again enhanced (substantially).  The .COM included in the CRCKK31.LBR
reflects these improvements.

The improvements are basically two: substanially complete UNIX-shell
syntax (including Unix-style wildcards, complete redirection
w/appending, etc) and possible substantial further speed improvement
when executed under CP/M 3.0 (or greater).  My compiler now generates
code that "automatically" uses CP/M 3.0's multi-sector read/write when
run under CP/M 3.0.  When run under 2.2 it uses the old
one-sector-at-a-time code.

On my computer, this version runs 3X times faster than version 3.0
did.  (With similar improvement with recompilation of other
utilities).

Anyway, I've listed the individual changes and improvements in the two
additional sections that I've added to the README.CRC file.

Just today I had in my hand the Borland book for their M2, it's real 
and you can order it and the interpreter/compiler from *real* people.
Catch is that Borland isn't selling it!

The "Borland Turbo" M2 was developed by an outside s/w house and is
being sold by them.  Name escape's me, but it's right there on the
cover, along with Borland.  Check out the recent BYTE's for Ciarcia's
pieces on his new computer -- there is a reference to this s/w house.

I did inspect the manual, over lunch.  The M2 is apparently a variation
of the M2M interpreter, though there is mention of producing assembler
code.  There are two versions, one for the Z80 (CP/M) and another for
the new Ciarcia board.  An editor and linker are supplied.  COM files
may be produced.

We could not tell is the asm output could be ROMable or not.  Will know
more shortly as the owner puts it up on his Z80, CP/M machine.

I'm writing a program which runs on a PC and can read and write CP/M
floppy/hard disks across a SCSI interface.

I can't seem to find a good spec which describes (preferably in
pseudocode or equations) how block shift, blockmask and extent mask are
used to build/access the directory.

I can figure out easily enough how to read/write cp/m SS/SD floppies,
but playing with hard disks with large group sizes gets trickier.  DRI
documentation concerning low level disk formats seems nonexistant.

Any pointers to magazine articles, books, etc. would be useful.

A set of algorithms in C would be great.

Any help would be appreciated.

I've uploaded to simtel20 the file:

Filename			Type	 Bytes	 CRC

Directory PD:<CPM.BKGROUNDER>
FIXBG102.SUB.1			ASCII	   687  7B81H

The LOADBG.COM, v 1.02, file lost its last 4 bytes -- "3ENV" -- causing
possible errors in any system with a "Z" in its bios area.

The fixup is quickly made.  Get FIXBG102.SUB from PD:<CPM.BKGROUNDER>,
type it for instructions, and run with EX (which is a member of BGIIDEM2.LBR).

	I have a copy of FTL Modula for CP/M, and it works as advertised,
but . . . . . .

	1)	It is written to adhere to Wirth's _THIRD_ edition of the
manual, which has a _lot_ of differences from the _Second_ edition, which
most other Modulas adhere to.

	2)	It has a non-standard library, which makes for some severe
portability problems.  Modules which compile fine in Volition (UCSD p-System),
Logitech, and TURBO CP/M Modula-2, _don't_ in FTL without changes.

	I also have a copy of Borland's Turbo M2 (available from Echelon, Inc.,
835 N. San Antonio Rd., Los Altos  CA  94022; (415) 948-3820), and it is as
nice in every way as their Pascal, and nicer in that you can build much bigger
programs.  It is about $70.00  (they take plastic money).

Can anyone point me to a program (either PD or commercial) whichi

 I am aware of the P&T routine TRS2CPM, but it only moves files

Does someone with hands-on experience with the Wyse 50...
and Televideo 9xx... series terminals know how to determine,
from a program that is running on a host computer attached to one
of those terminals:

1. what screen attributes are active, in which locations of the
   screen?

2. what terminal modes are active, especially # columns, and text
   segment?

In order to complete a BackGrounder ii screendriver for this group
of terminals I'd like to be able to restore the current screen
attributes when the screen gets redrawn.  The manuals do not
seem to include commands to transmit attribute or mode information
to the host.

Subject: Modem7 batch protocol definition

For some time we've hoped that the Modem7 batch protocol would be
defined in easily-understood terms (which might help in finding how to
fix the infinite loop that happens if there is an error when sending
the filename).  I found this in a file called VAX-XMDM.ARC (available
in the SIMTEL20 PD:<MISC.VAXVMS> directory, an improved XMODEM (ver.
5.53) for VAX-VMS which does (optional) batch file transfer and
internal TEXT conversion.

--Keith

Batch protocol for MODEM7 and XMODEM multi-file transfer

Each must specify batch since different treatment of ACK
as first character of "block" is needed.

CAN character is frequently tested for and interpreted as cancel everything
1 sec timeout on characters usually

CHECKSUM used on filename sequence even if CRC to be used in file transfer

on error during filename sequence, both return to beginning
	sender returns to NAK wait
	and receiver returns to NAK send

Time sequence of transfer:
SENDER					RECEIVER

waits for NAK with 80 sec timeout
clear checksum
					NAK  at 10 sec interval 'til ACK or CAN
ACK					
					waits for filename chars 1 sec timeout
					on error goes to above NAK
Loop 11 times (though filename buffer
	allows more)

	(Strip parity bit)
	send next filename character
	(in CP/M FCB form, no dot,
	blank filled, last 3 bytes
	are type)
	add to checksum
	await ACK 1 second timeout
					add to checksum
					ACK
End Loop

EOF (CTRL-Z)
add to checksum
					add to checksum
					send Checksum byte
					await ACK
					(note: if receives noise here,
					one end may proceed to
					normal file transfer, and other to
					restart filename and hang)
verifies checksum
OKNMCH (ACK) or BDNMCH ("u")

		Normal file transfer starts
					NAK or "C"
SOH   start of block
.
.
.
EOT   end of file
					ACK


expects NAK to start next filename
					NAK
ACK  set up receiver for filename
EOT  as first char of filename 
	terminates batch transfer
	(possibly as ANY character
	of filename)

Subject: RDCBM10.COM for C128

Hello,
I have been trying to get RDCBM10 running on my C128 and have had marginal
success.  My configuration is a basic C128 with a 1571 and a 1541. I 
don't have a memory expansion so cannot use drive M: as the CP/M target
drive.  It appears that the first few bytes of the file are not getting
written to the CP/M file (in the neighborhood of 100 +-) based on the
hex dumps I did of the files I tried. I haven't done exaustive testing
to determine the exact number dropped or if it is constant. I suspect
that it does work with drive M: since that is apparently the configuration
the author normally uses based on the defaults.

Has anyone gotten it to work with any combination of 1571/1541 drives
A: B: or E:?  

By the way, RDMS works at least for MS-DOS DS/9-sectors/track (the only
format I've tried). Thanks to Frank Prindle for adapting it for the C128.

Subject: RDCBM10.COM problem

Regarding Commodore 128 program RDCBM10.COM (Read CBM format disks):

Yes, indeed it seems that RDCBM10.COM (on SIMTEL20 in PD:<CPM.C128>) does
drop approximately 137 bytes from the beginning of the file it is copying if
the BINARY copy is specified.  The reason I didn't see this right away is I
only tried the TEXT copy (translated from Commodore to ASCII), and that works
perfectly! Looks like it's time to contact the author - MIX C strikes again
in all probability!  Incidentally, this bug is not related to the output drive
specification - it even fails this way when using M: as the output.

  I have had a Shuffleboard (TM) running in a Radio Shack MIII for three
years. It runs CP/M 2.2 with builtin routines to reset the disk drives to
mimic a number of different machines. It comes with two additional programs
to handle TRSDOS transfers - both directions.
  They might be willing to help short of buying the board. There ads were
in standard magazines a couple years back, or I could dig out the address
if you are interested.

I was reading the Fall 1985 S-100 Journal a couple of days ago.  In
the homebrewing article by Burt Hanagami, he mentions upgrading his
Expandoram II boards from 64k to 256k.  The article only gives his

Expandoram II board and would also like to upgrade it to 256k.  When
I called SD Systems about two years ago to get the PROM upgrade,
they told me it didn't work and I would be wasting my time.  My
question is, has anyone upgraded a SD Systems Expandoram II board to
256k? Could you please send me information on what is required to
upgrade the board.

Fellow CP/Mers - It took a long time for the Army Materiel Systems Analysis
Activity (AMSAA) to start using computers en masse, but it has definitely
happened now.  The word has gotten around that text preparation and written
communication via computer are really slick, and the whole mob seems to have
gotten accounts.  As a result, the poor old AMSAA VAX has been loaded down to
a crawl lately.  For those of you who dig UNIX load factors, I saw it hit 24
for a while today!

     To cut themselves some slack, AMSAA have just installed the "super-
screamer" of the Gould 9000 series.  It has two processors, a hardware
multiply accelerator and 16 megs of main memory, and it is called

				AMSAA-SEER

That's "see-er", as in "forteller of the future", a bit of a jab at the
business AMSAA is in - systems analysis.

     At the present time, human inertia is keeping most people on the VAX,
even though you sometimes have to wait quite a while for keystrike echos and
anything else you would like to happen fast.  So I have decided to remove a
small bit of the load from the poor old VAX, and at the same time speed-up the
handling of this list.  I have moved the list to SEER.

     Now for the (maybe) bad news:  We are running some new mail software
here.  In keeping with the current thinking and policy regarding network
address handling, the new mail system is heavily dependent on a "name server"
(another computer that knows all about host addresses).  When the name server
or the software that interacts with it screws-up, you would be amazed (if you
haven't seen it) how completely disgusting things can get.  To make things a
bit worse, the folks who have to fix these problems (with maybe one or two
exceptions) are just learning about all this good stuff, so we are all
scratching our heads together.

     Anyhow, it seems to be working now, so I have taken the plunge and moved
the list.

Subj: Z80MU emulator for IBM PC's
Message-ID:  <8701150641.aa02963@AMSAA-SEER.AMSAA-SEER.ARPA>

Some time ago (about 2 months I think) I posted a message saying that
 I had trouble getting the Z80MU, emulator program running on an IBM
 compatable (Olivetti M24). It used to load until the end OK without
 error whereupon it would drop out into MS-DOS. I am happy to say that
this did not happen with the NEW version of Z80MU just uploaded to
 SIMTEL20. I tried the old version on an IBM-AT under PC-DOS and it had
 the same problem also. If you are having the same problems as I did, then
 try the new version! Good luck Brian Jarvis Geneva Observatory.

Subject: Looking for a spreadsheet

I'd like suggestions on a fairly powerful, *INEXPENSIVE* spreadsheet that is 
available for Apple // CP/M.  I have VisiCalc Version 3.0 for the Apple, but
I find the 40-column limitation and the difficulty of porting disk-printed
files to CP/M for inclusion in WordStar documents to be a serious drawback. 
I'd really like something more powerful that works in 80 columns under CP/M. 

It's important that any tool recommended be able to do powers and roots, and 
the more powerful the conditional-expression facility is, the better.  (I'd 
really like an IF-THEN-ELSE syntax that can include nested conditionals as
either or both of its target operand expressions.)  I don't particularly need
row/column titling. 

Thanks in advance,

Hello!  I've been trying to connect my H89 to my pc clone (generic with
an AST I/O Plus2 copy) via serial ports.  I've been largely successful;
I can communicate between the two machines with no problems.  The only
snag is this:  when the H89 is plugged into the PC AND powered up, the
PC won't power up!  I've about driven myself nuts moving jumpers and
rearranging cables, but the only time I've managed to get the PC to come
on with the H89 powered on and plugged to it, I also managed to disable
the serial ports!!  Could some kind soul out there please give me some
kind of suggestion, perhaps a preferred cable configuration?  Thank you
in advance for any help!!!

ps- just goes to show, the RS232 standard isn't!  :-)

To: Info-CPM@AMSAA-SEER.ARPA
Message-ID: <12271888481.28.CENT.MBECK@OZ.AI.MIT.EDU>

Hello All -

     I find myself in need of a luggable or semi-portable CP/M system.
After looking through a bunch of ads in various magazines, it seems
the ENTIRE world has pulled the insides out of their old CP/M boxes
and substituted 8088-based electronics instead.  Nothing against
8088-based stuff; I've got software which is not available for that
series of processor.

     I would appreciate receiving pointers to firms which carry CP/M
(Z80-based, please) integrated systems (something slightly smaller
than the old Kaypro 2).  Requirements are:

	o Display built in.  (80 x 24 on a 4" to 5" display is okay.)
	o Serial port is a MUST (need to wire a modem to this thing).
	o Sufficient documentation to port some specialized com-
	  munications software into it (need hardware docs, schematics
	  would be a real plus).
	o Battery-powered units not necessary - commercial power is
	  available for this thing.
	o 5.25" or 3.5" disk drives are a must.

     Your comments/pointers are appreciated.

Regards,
Mark Becker

Subject: Multiplan for VT180 SQRT() bug
Cc: ucdavis!RHG%uregina1.bitnet@AMSAA.arpa


I have discovered a bug in the square root routine in Multiplan.  This
version is for the VT180 - the problem shows up when one tries to take
the square root of 9.94e-16.  The result is one order of magnitude
off.  This version of Multiplan is circa 1981 for a CPM 2.2 Z80 based
machine with a VT100 terminal.  Does anyone out there know of a patch
that I can apply, or how one might go about getting one from Microsoft?

				Thank you,

	Check a current issue of 80-Micro, Monte has an address in Arizona as
	well as Texas, something like "lizard flats". They still have adds in
	80-Micro so I don't think they went belly up. If you need the exact
	address email me and I'll find it for you. By the way, has anyone in
	netland figured out how to defeat the CCP/BDOS/BIOS checking section
	of Monte's SYSGEN? I managed to get a copy of ZCPR 1.0 sysgened but
	I had to hackup sysgen and I was hopeing there is an easier way to
	do it.

[Place your magic decoder ring next to CRT to reveal secret message from NSA]

Being somewhat naive about CP/M anyhow, I am open game for flames, so be
gentle.  I am taking a Computer Science class in assembler and we are using
CP/M-86 of all things on the PC.  I simply do NOT want to use ed line-based
editing; it offends me, considering I am using GNU Emacs to write this article
to the net.

Are there any versions of MicroEMACS or any other screen-oriented editors
for CP/M-86?  If so, please post or e-mail me a response (or, possibly,
uuencoded stuff if possible)  Thanks...

Re: Cheap and powerful spreadsheet for CP/M
Here is an idea.  Turbo/pascal comes with a spreadsheet as a 
sample source program.  I think it is public domain; check.  My
memory is that it doesn't handle zillions of columns but that
it does handle exponents, trig functions and the like.  Hackable?
Good luck.

I ran CP/M-86 for two years on my non-ibm compatible micro and I have
only found one editor that was of any use: Turbo Pascal. The editor was
well worth the sixty or seventy dollars I spent. You can even configure
the keys to be something like emacs.

Subject: Re: Recommendation wanted for luggable/portable CP/M machine

Try a Bondwell 12 if you can find one. It's built like a Compaq, and is a bit
smaller and lighter than a Kaypro. Or call Kaypro here in San Diego (Solana
Beach, actually) and ask if they have any Kaypro 1's for sale. The Kaypro 1 is
essentially an effort to get rid of surplus parts, so direct from Kaypro the
brand new machine would only cost you $595 or thereabouts. I used one for over
a year with no problems and sold it for almost as much as I paid for it. They
are outfitted with DSDD drives and a hi-res screen, and some even come with
K-10 motherboards which come in handy should you want to install a hard disk
later on.

You might try one of the following from SIMTEL20:

Directory  PD:<CPM.VDOEDIT>

	VDE233.LBR.1		BINARY	 53632  ECDCH
	VDO25B.LBR.1		BINARY	 57600  07FBH

Both are screen-oriented editors.  I have used vde for about 2 weeks(!)
so I am still learning.  Haven't tried VDO yet but they seem similar
(started from the same root).  VDE has a wordstar 'flavor', commands
are ESC-x, CONTROL-x, ^Qx, and ^Ox. It also has macro capabilities
which can have 1-255 repeat counts (but I haven't figured out how to
save/reload the macros).  It comes with an install program to set up
for various terminals.  If you are lucky, yours already has a configuration
file set up, otherwise you can roll your own.  My only complaints are
that screen update is slow (on my C128, but then everything is) and
the command codes are non-intuitive (even if I can remember the
letter, I get the 'ESC/CONTROL/^Q/^O' part wrong but that will come).
If you have a memory mapped vidio that meets the requirements, there
is a VDM version that should run much faster.

They aren't the best editors in the world, but they beat the heck
outta ED and the price is right.

Message-ID:  <8701210835.aa05396@AMSAA.AMSAA.ARPA>

Marc - Thanks for your note regarding info-cpm mail delivery problems.  The
effects you are seeing are the result of several hosts operating with out-
of-date routing tables.  AMSAA-SEER is a relatively new machine, which has
been on the net only since the beginning of the year.  Thus, hosts having
obsolete routing tables do not list AMSAA-SEER, and they reject mail from that
machine as being from from a bogus host.  These problems will continue until
one of the following happens:

   1. The host administrators of the "problem machines" update their tables,
or
   2. The rejects become so annoying that I delete the offending addresses
      from the info-cpm distribution list.

I have written to some of the aforementioned host administrators, and am
awaiting some action on their part.  I have also deleted some entries.  Any
addresses still causing problems at the beginning of next week will be zapped.

     Thanks again for your interest.

interpreters and/or compilers for dBase II, and that no fewer than three
of them were in the public domain.  As a modestly disaffected user of
the Ashton-Tate product, this raised my interest level.  I haven't heard
of any of these PD items, though.

Does anyone out there know of any PD dBase II interpreters or compilers,
and if so, would you please provide me a pointer to them?

Please reply to  so@isec-oa  and I will summarize for the net.

Subject: H89 Screen Gremlin
Recently, my venerable H-89A has started to exhibit a strange screen
phenomenon.  After one to two hours of operation, an amorphous area of
very reduced intensity crawls around the screen.  Data is not disturbed,
and the affected area nearly always covers the width of the screen.  It
is not, however, confined to a rectangular area bounded by lines -- it
seems rather shapeless, and it moves about, typically from bottom to top.

It appears to be a Terminal Logic Board problem, but I haven't been able
to isolate it.  The H-89A has an upgraded power supply, and no recent
modifications, so I doubt it is that.

If anyone out there has had or heard of a similar problem, and its cause,
please drop me a note  (so@isec-oa).

Dick Stanley.

I'm looking for a C-Compiler that runs in the CP/M-80 environment.

Important features would be:

        - it MUST create 8080-object code (NOT Z-80), because my
          target machine uses an 8085 as central processor. How-
          ever, the compiler need not run under 8080, my development
          system has an Z-80 built in.

        - it must create ROMable code, that means: separate DATA and
          CODE segments.

        - code must be able to run standalone, without the CP/M en-
          vironment (I know I have to write my own startup module then
          and that I can't use most of the runtime library - but that's
          OK with me).

        - it should be interlinkable with assembly language routines,
          preferrable compatible with the RMAC-package.

        - it should be a commercial product. I tried SCC8080 and had
          no luck running it, I think there must be an error in the
          runtime code provided. As I'm not the one who has to pay
          for it, I don't want to fiddle around with an undocumented
          product.

Thanx for any information,

I cannot locate my manual for my Cromomco ZASM assembler.
(yes, it is a legal copy, coming with my CP/M disk from the VAR)
Does anybody 'out there' answer these questions:

1) I don't have system call #90, 92 for the date and time.
How can I specify them for the heading?

2) How can I specify 132 column mode?
	(it currently truncates comments at column 80)

3) What other options can I specify?

Thanks!

        Use: 'DATE = mmddyy'     for the date...
           : 'TIME = hhmmss'     for the time...

>2) How can I specify 132 column mode?

        Use: 'WIDTH = a decimal #'     to set the page width...
           : 'TRUNC = a decimal #'     to set it and truncate there...

        Now that would be cheating!

Subject: Turbo Modula-2 demo
To: info-cpm@AMSAA-SEER.ARPA
Message-ID: <12273174802.12.RCONN@SIMTEL20.ARPA>

	I have created a new directory under PD:<CPM> called PD:<CPM.TURBOM2>
and placed the file BOXDEMO.LBR in it.  This is a demo of Borland's
Turbo Modula-2 which I felt may be of general interest.  The following is
BOX.DOC, which is contained within BOXDEMO.LBR.

---- BOX.DOC ----

Borland's Turbo Modula-2 for Z80's/HD64180's
	by Rick Conn
	23 Jan 87

	The following files constitute a simple demonstration of
Borland's Turbo Modula-2.  The demo is dependent on a TVI 955 terminal
(it may also run on a TVI 950 - I haven't tried it), and the BOXTEST
routine (the mainline) draws 5 boxes on the screen using business graphics.
This demonstration illustrates the Turbo Modula-2 packaging concept
(definition/implementation modules).
	Echelon sent me a copy of Turbo Modula-2, and, being a fan of Ada,
I took a serious look at the system.  I am very pleased with it.  Turbo
Modula-2 is certainly not Ada (or even close to Ada), but it does contain
some of the really useful concepts that I regularly employ in Ada programming.
For instance,
	1) Turbo Modula-2 supports a packaging concept.  The definition
module/implementation module concept allows a module to be defined without
actually being implemented, allowing programs to be written based solely
on the definition module (deferring the creation of the implementation
module to a later date).
	2) Turbo Modula-2 supports exceptions.  I really like this concept
in Ada, and, in some ways (particularly wrt the ability to pass strings
in exceptions), I like Turbo Modula-2's exception mechanism better.
	3) Turbo Modula-2 supports multi-processing (coroutines).  The
mechanism is simple, not nearly as sophisticated as Ada tasking, but it
is useful.
	I really like Turbo Modula-2 and plan to play with it for a while.
Like Turbo Pascal, Turbo Modula-2 has a very nice integrated working
environment (editor/compiler/librarian).  The code generated by Turbo
Modula-2 is reasonably efficient.

	BOXTEST.COM - COM file containing BOXTEST and BOXLIB; runs

------------------------------------------------------------------------
INSTRUCTIONS FOR COMPILING
	1. Compile BOXLIBD.MOD first.  This the definition module for
BOXLIB which contains the definitions of the types and procedures
within BOXLIB that are visibile external to the BOXLIB module.  Once
compiled, rename the BOXLIBD.SYM file which was created to BOXLIB.SYM.
	2. Use the Turbo Modula-2 librarian to create a new library and
place BOXLIB.SYM into this library.  Add this new library to the
compiler search path.
	3. Compile BOXLIB.MOD next.  This is the implementation module
for BOXLIB which contains the implementations of those procedures
declared in the BOXLIBD definition module.  Compiling BOXLIB.MOD
creates BOXLIB.MCD.
	4. Use the Turbo Modula-2 librarian to add BOXLIB.MCD to the
new library (which already contains BOXLIB.SYM).
	5. Compile the mainline module BOXTEST.MOD.  The resulting
BOXTEST.MCD file may then be linked (be sure the new library which
contains BOXLIB.SYM and BOXLIB.MCD are in the search path).  BOXTEST.MCD
may also be run without explicit linking to create a COM file.

Re: Linking .REL files with Turbo Modula-2

From: bridger@rand-unix.arpa

Rick--

Have you, or anyone else, figured out how to use routines
assembled/compiled outside the Modula-2 system with M2?

The Echelon book says that M2 will be able to make use of SYSLIB and
other Microsoft REL-format libraries.  However, it also says that M2
can call procedures in REL format, but not FUNCTIONS (which return values)!

To be of much use as a general-purpose language, and specifically
in Z-System environments, M2 needs a way to link in ASM (and C and
FORTRAN) generated REL files which return values.  I'd guess that
such routines will require some type of M2-compatible header that
communicates their function and argument types to the linker.

Do you have the specs, or any suggestions?

Subject: New version of RDCBM for Commodore C128 CP/M

Now available from SIMTEL20...

Filename			Type	 Bytes	 CRC

Directory PD:<CPM.C128>
RDCBM20.LBR.1			BINARY	 17280  B99EH

    This program is a general purpose file copier, which copies from a
Commodore DOS format disk to a CP/M disk.  It is designed to be faster
and more convenient to use than any of the existing CBM->CP/M copiers.
It uses burst mode on 1571 drives, and can write to the 17xx RAM
expander or to a 1571 onto any format disk the drive supports.  It does
not require you to exit from CP/M to use it, as it is a CP/M transient
utility.
    Version 2.0 corrects a serious bug in version 1.0, and as a side
benefit is smaller and faster.  Version 1.0 stripped a few hundred
bytes from the beginning of binary files when copied, and also had
problems handling files larger than the memory buffer.  Version 2.0
corrects both of these problems, and has been completely tested on both
types of floppy drive and the RAM expander, and properly performs
binary and text copies on one drive or two.

Hardware requirements are as follows:

    o A Commodore 128 computer

    o At least one 1541 or 1571 disk drive (1571 recommended)

    o Optional but recommended 1700 or 1750 RAM expansion


    The program is set up to operate with two drives, and in fact this
decreased the code size substantially.  However, it works reasonably
well with one floppy if you select drive E as the second drive.

SIGNS version 4.1 and MakeFont version 2.3 are now available from SIMTEL20.

There are now four libraries (or archives) to this set of programs:
TSIGNS, ISIGNS, MSIGNS, and GSIGNS.  Generally speaking, TSIGNS
contains a complete set of files for TurboPascal under CP/M-80, ISIGNS
contains the complete set for MS-DOS, MSIGNS contains generic sources
and executables [in Pascal MT+] for CP/M-80 (8080's), and GSIGNS
contains generic sources and executables [in TurboPascal] for CP/M-80
(Z80).  Pick whatever you need, all can (generally-speaking)
standalone.

SIGNS is a program to make banners (down page) and signs (across
page).  Written in TurboPascal, SIGNS allows lots of options: input
from keyboard or file, output to screen, printer or file, change
height and width of output, and printer control, all in an screen
oriented format.  Generic versions are a bit less capabile and don't
have fancy screen displays.

A separate program, MakeFont, is used to generate the random access
fontfile used by SIGNS.  Three fontfiles are included, one of which
will work only on the MS-DOS version (it's *BIG*).

The full-blown SIGNS is supplied in source code - it may have to be
recomplied, preferably with TurboPascal.  If you don't have Turbo
Pascal, you will have to get either of the GSIGNS or MSIGNS which
contains two other versions: a stripped down version (MSIGNS) without
all the fancy Turbo-Pascal-specific functions, (the executable COM
file for CP/M-80 was done with DR's Pascal MT+ so it should run on
8080's and 8085's too) and a TurboPascal version (GSIGNS) that is very
near to the full SIGNS but with the screen and printer controls
stripped out (this executable COM file for CP/M-80 was done with
TurboPascal, so it's probably Z80 only.)

MS-DOS people have it a bit easier, ISIGNS contains both sources and
executables.

The library name is only a mneumonic to remember the contents of each
library, all are varients or different versions of the base 'SIGNS'.

I have several different applications where I would like to read or write
simple ascii files from msdos or pcdos floppies on my Kaypro 4.  A format
utility that came with the Kaypro allows me to write to a VT180 disk which
I can read on the DEC Rainbow.  The Rainbow has a program to read the CPM
file over to MSDOS.  The process does not work the other direction so most
transfers have been via modem.  

The Kaypro program also lists a few IBM formats but wouldn't they be a CPM 
format and not PCDOS.  Now I need to get documents to and from an IBM PC 
that I do not have access to.  I only get the floppies.  Does anyone have a 
conversion program or any other suggestions?

There is a commercially available program titled UNIFORM which
allows CP/M machines to read other disk formats, to include
MSDOS.

Sounds like this would be "just the ticket."

Good luck...

Wild cards are allowed.  PD:<cpm.arc-lbr>*.* will get the entire directory.

The directory list can be found in PD:<ada>ada.crclst.  Information on
specific files (i.e., descriptions) are found in PD:<ada.general>.

Each main directory has directoryname.crclst (where directoryname is
the name of that main directory).  The crclst file contains the names,
sizes and CRCs of files in ALL subdirectories under that main directory.

Version numbers should be IGNORED.  Do not include them in your
archive server request.  You will automatically get the latest version
of the file if one exists with that name.

Send a message to ARCHIVE-REQUEST@SIMTEL20.ARPA with the command:

SEND BOOTSTRAP

as the first and only line of your message.  It will give a complete
listing of files to get started with.

No.  You'll have to tell ARCHIVE-REQUEST to send the file in HEX
format or UUENCODED.

Here is a copy of the file you get when you tell the server to
SEND HELP.

-----
To obtain up to five files in a single request message by netmail from
the public domain archives kept on SIMTEL20.ARPA, send a message to:

ARCHIVE-REQUEST@SIMTEL20.ARPA

or via uucp:
   ...!ucbvax!simtel20.arpa!archive-request
   ...!uw-beaver!simtel20.arpa!archive-request
   ...!decwrl!simtel20.arpa!archive-request
   ...!lll-crg!simtel20.arpa!archive-request
   ...!ut-sally!simtel20.arpa!archive-request
   ...!harvard!simtel20.arpa!archive-request

[do NOT use host "seismo" - they are blocking messages from the server]

The message body must contain lines beginning with the keyword SEND,
one SEND line for each file requested.  Case is not significant.

The general syntax of a SEND line is:

SEND format filename

In general, a filename consists of the following components:

device:<directory>file.type.generation

"device:" is usually PD:, and the combination of PD:<directory> is
expected unless an alias has been advertised of the form "alias:",
which takes the place of both device and directory fields.  The
generation field should be left off in order to default to the highest
generation number so you can be sure of getting the latest version of
the file requested.  "file.type" follows the usual filenaming
conventions.

In all formats listed below, if the file to be sent is larger than
55K, the file is sent in numbered parts.  The parts must be
reassembled in order and edited to remove any headers, preface, and
trailers before the process can be reversed to reconstruct the
original file.

Allowable formats are:

SEND HELP
        This file you are reading now.

SEND INFO
        A detailed description of the SIMTEL20 Archives, which
        includes this file, pointers to certain key files, and
        descriptions of various file transfer programs and related
        utilities.

SEND BOOTSTRAP
        A brief quick reference listing of filenames of the key
        utilities used to reconstruct files sent by the compression
        and encoding techniques listed below.

SEND DIR filespec
        This format returns a CRC list of the requested files, and is
        the only format which allows wildcard filenames (but not
        wildcard directory names).  The list is sent as an ASCII text
        file.  The wildcard characters are "*" and "%".  The asterisk
        means any number of characters, while the percent sign means
        exactly one character.  Either or both may appear in any
        combination in either or both the file or type fields, while
        only the asterisk may appear in the generation field.

SEND RAW filename
        If the file is ASCII, it is sent as-is, regardless of size.
        This format is the least efficient over network and mail
        gateway resources.  Use this format only if you absolutely
        must.

With the four formats listed below, if the file is ASCII and under 25k
characters, it is sent as-is, as if RAW format was requested.  Binary
files are always processed according to the requested format.
However, a request for ARC or SQ processing of files with type ".ARC",
".LBR", or ".%Q%" is ignored and the original file is either uuencoded
or hexified (if possible), according to the requested format.  If the
file was not sent RAW, a short preface is inserted at the front of the
message describing the process actually taken and a CRC entry
describing the original file.

SEND ARE filename  or  SEND filename
        The original file is made into a uuencoded ARC file.

SEND ARH filename
        The original file is made into a hexified ARC file if the ARC
        file is under 64K bytes long.  Otherwise, an apology is
        returned instead of the requested file.

SEND SQE filename
        The original file is made into a uuencoded SQueezed file.

SEND SQH filename
        The original file is made into a hexified SQueezed file if the
        Squeezed file is under 64K bytes long.  Otherwise, an apology
        is returned instead of the requested file.

To get started in finding your way around the SIMTEL20 archives, send
a message to the server with the request: SEND INFO

	There are a group of files available from simtel20
that were released to the public domain by KAYPRO to do disk
formatting to/from other systems.
	pd:<cpm.kaypro>mfdisk.inf is a note from the releaser
					at KAYPRO.

The files are as follows:
	pd:<cpm.kaypro>mfdisk2.com	for ss/dd KAYPROs
	pd:<cpm.kaypro>mfdisk4.com	for ds/dd KAYPROs
	pd:<cpm.kaypro>mfdisk10.com	for ds/dd KAYPROs with Hard Disks

I have not used these programs, but they were supposed to have been in
use by the masses before release to the domain. I had purchased UNIFORM
before I found out about these. UNIFORM is an easy to use program, and
I have not had a problem with it. It supports ds/dd formats where I have
heard that other commercially available programs don't.
If you get the mfdisk programs up and running, perhaps you could
let the net know.

	Take Care

I don't know if these will work on a Kaypro, but they are free.  There

There is also a C128 version in PD:<CPM.C128>RDMS233C.LBR. It works

Due to the design of the C128 BIOS and the 1571 disk drive, I seriously doubt
it will be able to run any generic version of UNIFORM (Fred Bowen, any thoughts
on this?).  But all things are possible, so you should contact the manufacturer
of UNIFORM and flat-out ask them that question.  In any case, I've modified
RDMS233 to enable it to read (read only!) MSDOS format diskettes on the C128
under CP/M+ with a 1571 drive.  I've also written another utility, UNIDRIVE,
which currently allows the C128 CP/M to read or write any of 24 different CP/M
diskette formats (but not MSDOS).  Neither program will "format" a diskette.

The appropriate files on SIMTEL20 are:

	PD:<CPM.C128>RDMS233C.LBR
	PD:<CPM.C128>UNIDRIVE.LBR

Subject: Re:  Will C128 CP/M run Uniform software?

I don't have any experience with Uniform, but if it doesn't work on
a C128 I know of two public domain programs which *might* meet your
needs. (don't know Uniform's capabilities).

One is RSMS233C which is available from SIMTEL20 as
pd:<cpm.c128>rdms233c.lbr which runs in cp/m mode and
copies files from MS-DOS to CP/M but not the other way.

Another which is available on some BBSs in this area at least is
Crosslink which runs in 128/80-column mode and copies to/from
C128, CP/M, MS-DOS formats with or without ASCII<->PETASCII<->
Screen code translation. Its major drawback is that it only handles
files up to 45.5K bytes. The'driver' is in Basic with m/l routines
to do the actual read/write stuff.  The m/l is (semi-)documented
with at least the entry points for the various format reads/writes,
translations but not the required parameters. These could be 
divined from the Basic calls but you need a 'pretty printer'
as the writer crammed as many statements/line as possible to keep
the buffer size as large as possible, making it hard to read.
Once that was done, you could write your own to read a little/write a
little to handle larger file sizes.

Sorry I couldn't answer your original question, but these are alternatives
if the answer is 'no'.

# .  Does anyone have a 
# conversion program or any other suggestions?

Yes, Call Intersecting Concepts @ 805-373-3900
They have Media Master versions for both the
Rainbow and the Kaypro, and Media Master Plus
for the PC (+clone). I do not follow where
you are going to/from so I can not say which
is the best one for you to buy. 
But all of them read/write/format disks for
'foreign' machines. The exact # of formats
depends on physical limits of the machine's
drives (ie can not make DS disks on Rainbow)
Pleas email me if you need more assistance.

Hello,
   I tried to send netmail to archive-request with 5 requesting files.
last week. After 3 days, I received one of requested files but other
didnt arrived and had bounced because WISCVM.WISCV.EDU lost link from
SIMTEL20 and farther nodes. I tried send news to Info-CPM and get
returned mail and gave me error: Undeliverable to <Info-CPM@AMSAA-SEER>,
Unable connect to that over 3 days. I dont believe that! I tried to send
via UUCP to simtel20.arpa but I didnt receive any mail in several days.
WISCVM cut off servers that cause bounced big files/mails. Please contact
to WISCVM.WISC.EDU!
 
Thanx,
 
Tim.

The Archive Server attempts to send its replies to the requestor
based on the Reply-To: or From: lines of the messages it receives,
in that order.  Recently, messages coming from BITNET sites through
WISCVM.WISC.EDU are being received here without the From: lines
being coerced into the form user%host.BITNET@WISCVM.WISC.EDU.  As we
don't have a table of BITNET hosts, these replies fail.

Thus, if you sent in a request from a BITNET host over the last
several days and didn't receive a reply, you now know why.  When
I hear that WISCVM.WISC.EDU has repaired their mailer, I'll pass
the word so that you may resume sending your requests.  (Alternately,
if anyone knows where I can periodically pick up a copy of a complete
list of BITNET hosts, I'll try to keep our mailer's database current.)

That's fine, except there are many hosts, including this one, which
are not yet capable of resolving domain names.  However, I suspect
we'll have that capability in place long before the BITNET hosts adopt
domain names.  BTW, although .EDU would appear the most likely domain
name, BIT.NET, ala CS.NET, is probably the one which will end up used.

Alternatively all those on bitnet could just use domain names. .EDU seems
an appropriate domain. If those hosts on bitnet would just register their
names in a well known domain like .EDU people would be able to respond
to messages from uucp or arpanet or any on the many networks world wide
supporting the domain name convention.
