  Steve, I retrieved the following two messages from CBBS/DETROIT,
a local message service.  I don't know this guy Winkler, but have
seen his stuff advertised on CBBS's around the country, and (so
far) have heard no bad words about him.
  One advantage I can see is that he provides source for his sys-

to solve them.
  I don't know this guy and can't vouch for his software, but thought
it may be what you need.

Subject: New versions of MODEM and XMODEM

MODEM527.ASM has been updated, and the new file now has the
revision number in the name - instead of the revision date.
The file is MC:CPM;MODEM 206ASM

XMODEM41.ASM has been updated, and the new file is
MC:CPM;XMODEM 42ASM

There have been significant improvements made for users of
the PMMI modem (and hopefully someone with the DC Hayes modem
will add it to the new routines) by checking the overrun and
framing error flags.  See MC:CPM MODEM 206DOC and MC:CPM XMODEM 42DOC.

A bug in MODEM527 which allowed ambiguous or no filename at all
has also been fixed.

These programs support PMMI, DC Hayes, and external serial port
modems.  As mentioned before, the MODEM527 (from which they were
derived) was the "cleanest" and easiest to get up and running.

The new programs have the enthusiastic support of Ward Christensen,
who wrote the original MODEM2.ASM.

I am considering the purchase of a Heathkit H89 computer and have not
been able to decide whether or not to spend more $ ($200) for CPM instead
of the Heath operating system, HDOS.  HDOS comes with a lousy Basic but
CPM doesn't, which accounts for most of the cost.  Does anyone have
any ideas about the differences between HDOS and CPM and what you
consider to be the advantages of CPM?  I have also noticed the software
in the CPM account.  I think that HDOS has the same 8080 assembler.
Would most of the software be compatable with both HDOS and CPM or does
it have specific CPM functions?

Thanks,
	-Michael Adler

P.S.  Could I be put on the mailing INFO-CPM mailing list?

Subject: HDOS loses

I don't know much about HDOS, but even if it's the best thing around, you're
better off with CP/m, since everyone else has it.  I might add that I think
CP/M is one of the worst crocks ever, but it's popularity makes it a must.

You can still run your HDOS programs with an HDOS emulator running under CP/m.
Since all the HDOS system calls start with a RST instruction that CP/m doesn't
use, this should be fairly easy to write, although I have not tried it.
Transferring HDOS programs and files to CP/M format might be a problem.

Subject: Dumb Question

We just received the Winterhalter Remote Batch Terminal Emulator and
the writeup says to rewire the dip headers for a Real-Time Clock of
3.328 ms, Interrupts for Clock as RST5, and for Modem as RST4, and
modem data rate controlled by modem.  The specific details of what to
do are given for our system.

My question is: if we were to do this, would regular CP/M use of other
programs not be bothered by those interrupts (or do I have to do
something to field them)?  Would a regular printer connected to the
port used for the modem no longer work properly?

I have a mixed educated guess as to what will happen without actually
trying it.  Has anybody tried and know for sure?

Subject: TeleVideo Terminal control codes needed

In response to your message sent  05/17/81 04:30:38

There are now, to my understanding five versions of terminals marketed by
TeleVideo, Inc.  The 912B and 912C differ only in keyboard arrangement (the
912B has an 84 key keyboard comprised of alphanumeric characters, symbols,
and control keys to perform its full operations; the 912C has an 82 key
keyboard, in a standard typewriter style, with alphanumeric characters,
symbols, and control keys).  The 920B and 920C are similar to the 912x
series except that 11 special function keys have been added.  All four
models can produce the standard full 128 ASCII character set and can be
optionally (read more $, about $25) be configured with a second display
page.  Upper/lower case display with descenders is standard.  There is a 
new 950 model about which I know zilch.

For the control codes, note that a Televideo is almost identical to a Soroc
IQ 120 terminal.  For a lot of CP/M programs which tailor to terminal codes,
settings for Soroc IQ 120s works quite well.

Does anyone know a a public domain routine in 8080 code to load in
and execute .COM files.  (this is without leaving a note for
the CCP).  In addition, I need the address in the BDOS (offset may be 
a better term) for the print flag - tells whether a ^P was typed, and for
the submit file in progress flag.  I am writing a modification of the
CCP and need this information desparately.  The load and go program
is not as important, I am just lazy.

Thanks for the information that you sent me, but I think that you
missunderstood my original question.  I do not wish to know how
to auto run a program on power up, I am looking for a routine
that does a load and go of com files, without help
from the CCP.  This is because the system I am working on,
spelt developing, does not have a CCP, and needs this to substitute
for the CCP.  In effect, it is one of a 5 part system that replaces
the CCP (one of the 5 parts).  The rest of the system provides a high
level job control language (extensible) for cpm and a
user modifiable shell, as well as all sorts of other fun
little goodies.

Subject: CP/M 3.0

Hello, everyone,

        I just received a wild  rumor  today,  and  was  wondering  if
anyone  can  substantiate  it.   The  rumor:   Digital Research is now
releasing the preliminary version of  CP/M  3.0  for  examination  and
comments from selected parties (in particular, those who paid the $60K
license fee for source modification, etc, rights).  From my source, it
appears  that  3.0  has a radically different directory structure, and
protection mechanisms such as file passwords are implemented.

Re:   Phone number/download

Peter, you asked for a number - but I'm not sure which one you wanted.
The message came with no subject header.  I guess maybe this was about
my announcement of the new FINDBAD program.  If you can FTP from MC,
you can get the file that way.  It's in MC:CPM;FBAD54 ASM and is a
normal ASCII file which should FTP.  The phone number from my remote
CP/M system is (313)-588-7054.  It is a "callback" system.  You have
to ring once, hang up and call again within 40 seconds.  It will
answer the the second call automatically.  Just press RETURNs until it
senses your baud rate.  It will accept 110, 300, 450 and 600 baud
using the standard 103 modem tones.

  Re: Directory problems with BDOS-PAT
 
  Just a note about using STAT.COM with BDOS-PAT.ASM
installed.  It seems that if you do a file attribute
set operation with STAT when in a non-zero user area,
STAT will also get any occurance of the name in user 0
too.  To make matters worse, after STAT grabs the file
from user 0, it writes it back with the current user
number.  For example, if you are in user 5 and type: 
STAT *.* $R/O
STAT will also make all the files in user 0 into R/O
and will "move" them into user 5.  This can be very
dangerous if you have 2 files with the same name in
different user areas.  About the only way to recover
from an error like that is to use DU and be VERY
CAREFUL.  This problem also occurs with several other
programs, and also the built-in CP/M commands.

Subject: Search/Search Next

Can anyone enlighten me about a detail concerning the BDOS functions
search/search next?  The CPM 2.x documentation is reasonably explicit
and it is fairly obvious how to develop a list of file names that
match a given ambiguous file name.  What is unclear is whether one
can issue other BDOS function calls between consecutive search next's.
For example, a "TYPE *.ASM" command might look like this...

	while ((dircode = srchnxt(fcb)) != 0xFF)
		typefile( tbuff + (dircode << 5));
	typefile (fcb)
	{       ... various BDOS read sequential calls ... }

The reason I pose this question is that the 1.4 documentation rather
cryptically says that the Search for next occurrence function is
the same as Search for file, "but called after function 17 (no other
intermediate BDOS calls allowed)", whereas the 2.x documentation
takes no stand on this question.  If it is true that one cannot
do anything useful between consecutive search next's (other than
print out a directory), how does one implement something like the
above TYPE command?  The only examples I have seen actually scan the
entire directory first and store a list of filenames in a table
before performing the function on each name in turn.

Subject: Search first/next question

  Concerning the problems using search first/next to muck
around with files...  I spent some time around 4 or 5 years ago reading
a disassembled version of the CPM 1.4 BDOS, and as I remember it:
  Search First was used to initialize a counter into the directory
       area, and to find the first occurance of a ambiguous filename.
  Search next just kept up the search without reinitialization.
 
  As CP/M would use the current DMA area for directory storage, and
not touch that counter elsewise, as long as you don't mess up
the DMA area (by perhaps switching DMA areas for other IO, then switching
back), you'd be OK using other BDOS calls.  But if you mess up the
current DMA area, since the next search continues within the current block
(in all likelyhood, since directory entries are stored 4 per sector),
it'll get all confused when looking at "smashed" filenames (FCB's)

Subject: DMA ADDRESSES

  If your program is resident while other programs are running
(such as is the case with DESPOOL, which prints a file in "back-
ground" while other programs are running), you can intercept the
BDOS calls by transplanting the address field of the jump inst-
ruction at address 5 with a jump to your intercept routine; the
intercept routine examines the parameter number in the C register,
and, if it is a SETDMA function request, stores the DMA address
in the DE register.  The code sequence could look like this:
        MOV  A,C   ;CHECK THE PARAMETER
        CPI  SDMAF ;SETTING DMA?
        JNZ  NOPE
        XCHG       ;YEP, SAVE A COPY FOR US
        SHLD OURDMA
        XCHG
NOPE:   JMP  $-$

  Note that the $-$ address (which is the real address of the BDOS)
must be filled in by the same routine that overlays the jump at 5.
  Also note that this changes the "top of memory" for programs
that read this address field, such as PIP, to determine the amount
of usable memory.  If your program resides above CPM, this would
cause the BDOS and BIOS to be clobbered.  In this case, you
must overlay the address field of the jump instruction pointed
to by the instruction field of the jump at 5 (which is within
the BDOS), and not the jump at 5 itself.  This allows the BDOS
calls to be intercepted without changing "top of memory".
  Hope this answers your question.

Subject: DMA address finding

 ... yes, I know the "default" DMA area is at 80h.  However, my situation
is roughly like this:  I have implemented the full IOBYTE (mostly with
the aid of a TDL SMB card), I have room for 2K worth of misc. routines
well above CPM.  My user printer device is (to be) a disk-spooler; it
has its own buffer -- it must keep this buffer separate from the transient's
IO buffers (remember, we are never sure what the transient will be
or what/how many DMA areas it may be switching among).  So when it comes
time for the spooler to write a buffer-full, it must save the old
DMA address, set DMA addr to the new buffer (its own), write, and then
reset the old DMA address.  If I could guarantee that all transients
obey the sequence "set dma(addr); write" whenever they went to write, there'd
be no problem.  But I cannot.
  It looks as if I'll stick with that which Ron Fowler suggested,
 
0005 jmp bdos
<bdos>  jmp wherever   ->   <bdos>  jmp mypat (above f800 somewhere)
<mypat> if code=setdma then mysavearea=newaddress
        jmp wherever
 
... aggh, patches and patches on patches...
