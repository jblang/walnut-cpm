Could somebody tell me what Magnolia's link program does to address tables,
etc. when it is used to create their MOVCPM?  I need to know what a .HEX
file must contain to be accepted and the actions caused by various forms
of .HEX files.

It appears that the most logical way to create buffer space for ZCPR2 would
be to simply link a few hundred garbage bytes to MOVCPM.  If I need more space
for the cold boot routine, I could also patch it to jump to my linked code.

Thanks!

I have MODEM20.ASM working on the HP-125 PC.

Send me a blank, formatted disk and a postage-paid
return mailer and I'll send you what I have.

NOTE:  You will need a cable to go from the LARGE
50 pin connector to your serial modem.  The smaller
connector only transfers seven bits of data.

If you have more current or more accurate data on
the HP-125 and MODEM let me know.  I'm no expert.

MODEM731 is MANY revisions old, was around the time when bugs crept in
(which have long since been fixed).  Latest version if MODEM797, which
is compatible with MODEM2xx and XMODEMxx..

	The file FIXTEX 10ASM is on MIT-MC in AR21:CPM;  It is based
on FILTER and FILTEX by Keith Petersen (W8SDZ at MIT-MC). The assembly
switches allow 32 different operations to be performed on a text file.

The following describes what has been done:

	1. Changed to assemble with DRI's ASM,
	2. Changed so that if input file is FILENAME.ABC then output file
		is FILENAME.XYZ where the XYZ's are determined by assembly
		switches or, if renaming is chosen, the output file has
		the original file name and type and the input file name
		has the file type BAK,
	3. Modified so that output file can be on a different drive from
		input file,
	4. Added routines to output several types of files depending on
		assembly time switches, these switches can be set to do
		a number of operations (some are mutually exclusive).
		All cases pad the last sector with EOFs. The operations
		are:
	  a. leave text unchanged,
	  b. delete all control characters except CR, LF and TAB,
	  c. insert LF after each CR if absent,
	  d. insert CR before each LF if absent,
	  e. delete extraneous LFs (those not following CR),
	  f. delete LFs,
	  g. insert one space on each blank line,
	  h. delete LFs and insert a space on each blank line,
	  i. replace TAB with spaces,
	  j. delete LFs and replace TABs with spaces,
	  k. replace TABs with spaces and insert a space on each blank line,
	  l. delete LFs and replace TABs with spaces and insert a space on
		each blank line, (canonical bulletin board file),
	  m. delete any character following ESC,
	  n. replace more than one space with TABs where possible,
	  o. replace more than one space with TABs where possible
		except in 'qouted' strings, (canonical assembly file),
	  p. insert a TABs at start of each line,
	  q.  insert an arbitrary number of spaces at start of each line.

	Options f, g, h, i, j, k and l may be useful when sending files
to bulletin boards and mainframes. Option m may be useful when capturing
text from mainframes which control your terminal in full screen mode.
Option o can shorten assembly language files. Option a is useful when
CRC(K)ing a file sent or received using ITS LMODEM.

Does anyone have a disassembled version of the CP/M BDOS?
I've been trying to put the ARCHIVE patch, which turns the
third file parameter bit into an ARCHIVE bit, into my system, but
it insists on deleting any file which claims to have been archived.
I have to figure out what's happening.

There is a problem using LMODEM on MIT-MC over an ARPAnet TCP connection
that prohibits LMODEM from sending COM (binary) files.  The problem appears
to be that when LMODEM sends an 8C hex it is not transmitted to the ARPAnet,
or the Net itself does not pass this character along to the local system.
LMODEM still works for ASCII files provided that the check-sum character
generated by any block doesn't end up being 8C hex.  LMODEM does still work
correctly if connected via ARPAnet NCP.

to try bringing it up on a PDP-11/70. A C version seems the

Just a quick note to let everyone know that "vortex" has finally
returned to the, uh, "air".  Many thanks to everyone who responded
to my plea after the disk failure here -- and a special thank-you
to those of you who dropped by to help out.

Just in case anybody is curious... The Memorex 101 disk drive appears
to be defective *under* the sealed bubble -- so I've declared it to
be a total loss for the time being.  Vortex is now running on a 12.6
Meg 5 1/4" Winchester, loaned to me for a couple of months by a
gracious gentleman at Bell Labs.  It took me quite a while to get
it working properly with my hardware (the controller manufacturer did not
provide a reasonable driver for that particular disk, so my work
was cut out for me), and even longer to restore my voluminous backups
onto the new drive.  I have the loan of this drive for a couple of
months, what happens after that is still exceedingly unclear.

But for now, at least, the system seems to be running well (though somewhat
slower because of disk limitations) and the crisis appears to be over,
at least for a little while.  Thanks again.

Two matters;

Does anyone know any information about the disk format used by Hendrix
on their word processor systems.  The systems are PDP-11/34s and the
disks are single density (I believe), but beyond that I know nothing.
Before I attack their file structure by hand, any information forthcoming?


Typeahead --- isn't supported by CP/M as it comes from DRI.  Yet several
companies have implemented it in their BIOS (Pickles & Trout, I believe
InterSystem, etc.).  This works (with a few eaten characters) as long as
the ^S fix in not installed.  For those not familiar with the patch, it
fixes a bug where ^S would stop output ONLY if you had not hit another 
character first.

After the fix, CP/M reads any character typed during output to see if it
is a ^S.  If it is, fine.  If not, it just ATE the type-ahead.  Any 
solution?  Putting the ^S trap in BIOS is not really a good idea, as it
upsets binary I/O communication.

Chuck Forsberg hacked the SQ/USQ/TYPESQ for Unix.  I got them from his
RCPM system in Oregon, but found that due to their reliance on 16-bit
ints they wouldn't work on the Vax here.  I hacked in some conditional
typedefs  and now all is fine.

I sent the revisions back to Chuck and also to Keith Petersen, so he could
upload them to MIT-MC.

        I have just completed utility development on ZCPR2 and am
about  to devote time exclusively to finishing the documentation.
This is all that is left before release, which is  currently  set
for  Monday or Tuesday.  With luck, the schedule will be met this
time.

        It has come to my attention that at least one person  has
discovered the archives used on MIT-MC to store the test versions
of the ZCPR2 utilities and ZCPR2 itself  and  has  downloaded  at
lease  some  of them.  Please stop doing this immediately.  ZCPR2
has not yet been released, and if distribution is already  begin-
ning,  I  can  see  a lot of problems coming up.  Principal among
these is the fact that there have been several test  versions  of
the utilities in various states of development with the same ver-
sion numbers.  If these get out, then people  will  not  know  if
they  are  running the right version or not and a lot of time and
effort can be wasted in fixing non-existant problems on  software
that  has  already been fixed.  The only sure way to correct this
problem is to change all the version numbers of  all  the  utili-
ties,  and this could take days, delaying the release even furth-
er.

        Hence, if you have downloaded any of the ZCPR2  utilities
or  ZCPR2 itself, I recommend that you destoy all copies and wait
for the release.  It is only a few days away now.

UMODEM is in the UNIX archive under CPM.

CPM, of course, is a directory on MIT-MC.

I have uploaded FILTEX11.ASM and FILTEX11.COM to MIT-MC.
This is my ASCII file filter program which removes control
characters and "orphan line feeds".  This program is not
new, was written last year and I had thought I had uploaded
it before.  I found that version 1.0 was on MC instead.
The files are:

A coworker in our office has a printed copy of the CPMUG library volumes
1-85.  He is interested in one of the programs listed there and was
wondering of any of their software is accessible from the ARPANET.  I've
looked at the CPM programs on MIT-MC and didn't see it.  He's looking for
AUTOLOAD.COM and AUTOLOAD.DOC listed in volume 81.  This program allows
you to specify a program for the system to default to when you power-up or
reset.  (For example, after doing a reset, instead of returning to
CP/M, you could return to BASIC or WordStar or whatever you specify.)

	Several have expressed concerns like these and similar questions.
Negotiations are currently underway in several areas to solve the problem.
ZCPR2 distribution is not going to be easy.  The source files alone
total to over 1M bytes, and the HLP files add another 250K+, and the
manuals ... well, you've seen a little of the manuals (only a little!).

	I won't go into details yet ... very little is finalized.
Two things I can guarantee ... RCP/M's will have ZCPR2 if they want it
and SIG/M will have it.

	One possiblity I am looking at is an arrangement like what Workman
is doing.  I still do not approve of selling public domain software
(especially without asking the author first), but I am willing to enter
into an arrangement where an organization like Workman's will provide
a distribution AND ASSISTANCE point for a VERY REASONABLE fee.  Note
the operative words.  I'm kind of bending my ideals by saying that
sale of ZCPR2 is OK under the following conditions:

		1. The price is reasonable.

		2.  The seller has my permission to do so.

		3.  The seller will provide technical assistance
to the customer.

		4.  The seller will provide hard copies of the manuals
with ZCPR2.

		5.  Under NO CONDITIONS am I to make one cent of profit
from it and it is to be understood that the software is in the public
domain and copyrighted by me.

	If such a distribution organization can be found, this could
be the best solution.  As for reasonable price, the chief cost will be
the manuals.  I hope that a price of $30 or so can be arrived at
(the distributer HAS to make some profit ... or does he?  Another point).
A meeting will take place (to which I've been invited) at CP/M '83
to discuss the future/directions/etc of public domain software and other
things.  Please don't ask me for permission to attend ... not my meeting
and I can't authorize anyone else to attend.  Ward Christensen, Sol Libes,
and others will be there, however, so the representation is quite good.

	Will post the net on the outcome of the meeting when I return
from San Francisco.

There are several of us down here in OK who would like to get copies of
ZCPR2. However, we are experiencing technical difficulties - like an arpanet
host w/out FTP.  Also, being among those who can't FTP com files, getting
sq'ed files is painful. I would therefore like to explore some alternate
possibilities.

First, how soon will it be possible to get an 8" disk with all the appropriate
files on it (or disks)? Late January? Where will this be avialable from?

Is there any possibility of getting a disk from directly from you? I would
gladly provide a diskette and postage both ways.

Finally (last hope): is there an RCP/M or cnode or whatever with the ZCPR2
files on it? If so, where (number/name), and how large are all the files?

Now, if only UUCP actually gets this to you...

	Thanx,

Mailing list maintainers ;

 I am in the process of centralizing all ARPA mailing lists coming into
SUMEX-AIM to one mailbox to be made available as a Bulletin Board. This helps
us save disk space, and save processing time on both ends.
 I would appreciate it if you could forward to me the names of all people on
your mailing list at SUMEX-AIM, and add a address for
'<mailing list>@SUMEX-AIM' to your present mailing list (for example,
HUMAN-NETS@SUMEX-AIM). Then, I will ask the users of your mailing lists
from SUMEX-AIM to request to be removed from the list.

Thanks, Ed

is that many of my files are larger than the size of one of my floppies.
Would you happen to know of a program that can break up files and save them

Re:   MODEM797 bug?

I had a little trouble using MODEM797 and was hoping that
you might have a little help for me.  While transferring
files in the bulk mode I inadvertently entered this command:
  'TB A:*.*'    (Instead of the S for send I was thinking
T for transmit.  It erased all of the files on the diskette
and opened one with the name: ????????.???.  I recovered
all but the first file in the directory because the group
map for ????????.??? had been set to all zeros, and was
entered where my first file had been.

I'd like to be the one to fix it, but really not good
enough with assembler to do it. Any help would be apprec-
iated. I know, Iknow, Don't use the T, use the S.

I'm becoming interested in purchasing one of the new 103/212
"intelligent" modems such as the DC Hayes Smartmodem-1200 or the
Novation 103/212 modem.  In addition to originate/answer 103 and 212
modes, these modems provide rotary and DTMF dialing as well as ring
detect.  They generally contain an internal micro such as a Z8 and
commands and status replies are communicated between the host and the
internal micro via an RS-232 interface.  The best discount prices I
have seen so far are in the neighborhood of $550 for the DC Hayes.

I would like to hear from people who have experience with or opinions
about any of these modems as well as other modems I may be unaware of.
I have read the review of the DC Hayes 103-only Smartmodem.
Communicating commands on the same port as the data transmission is
obviously going to cause problems unless there is a technique for
out-of-band signalling, and even so, status reports of events such as
remote disconnect may be impossible to report in a manner
distinguishable from the data stream.

	Epson software arrived.  Patches, xerox manuals.  They
are NOWHERE NEAR ready to sell a product that can do what the
advertisiements say; in fact, I do not think they will EVERbe
able to do all of it, although that may simply be a mistake on
my part.
	The machine is good.  The software that comes with it to
a Beta test Site is not evaluable, because it isn't working.
The text editor cannot retrieve files.  I am certain that bug
will be fixed fairly quickly, but it leaves one loathe to spend
much effort trying other features of the machine; in order to do
anything, you have to have two machines, one to take notes on
while you try features of the other; since you will never be
able to get the notes back if you make them on the Epson.

An alternate operating system is "TPM-II" from "Computer Design
Labs".  I have nad no chance to play with it, but it appeares to
be CP/M like.  I t also seems to contain "ZAPPLE" which is an OS
for the Apple when the Apple is running a Z-80.  I don't
understand most of this, but it seemes needlessly complex
compared to standard CP/M.

	The Epson "HASCII" interface is wonderful for beginners
(or would be if it all worked) but I think one mig ht soon tire
of it; to get a menu can take about a minute, and everything
goes cascading through compulsory menus; at least thte documents
I have give no alternatives.  The major stuff is in command keys
on the keyboards, each of which lead you to menus which you can
control, and many of them lead you to still lower levels of
menu; and there is no jump from higest level past any
intermediate.  Since everything is SLOW; to save a three
paragraph file (it did save it, but I have to reset using TPM
and then TYPE command to see it)--to save a three paragraph file
and reread the system and get back to an (empty! -- the file
must be RETRIEVED only RETRIEVE doesn't at present work) took a
LONG time.
	This is probably all going to change.  The hardweare
looks awfully nice, inside and out, and the machine is a Z-80A,
so it surely is capable of faster work, even with 320K
double-sided 5 1/4" disks.  (The advertised HELP features are
not implemented either; not all of them, anyway; there's anote
saying they will be when they get  more room on disks, but no
explanaton of what that means).  
	My suspicion is that the advertised software package is
going to be a while coming; there's so little of it implemented
just yet.  A lot of this is ROM, by the way, making me wonder
why everything is so slow.  Are all 5 1/4 disks that way?  I
cannot recall that the Otrona is that bad; it's the only small
disk machine I have extensive experience with, except an Apple
the boys have--that's SLOW too.
	Prediction: the Epson will turn into a VERY nice
machine, but it's going to take them a while; meanwhile they
have all those ads out there telling you not to buy anything
else, but I'd think it will be at least summer before they get
all the bugs out of their new baby.
	It should be a NICE Z-80 when it is developed.  T hey
have a really nice keyboard, and lots of other stuff going for
it; if it were speedier and could do most of what is advertised
it would be great.
	

	I think I will put the Z-100 in another message.  This
is long enough.

	The Zenith Z-100 is a handsome computer, but that MSDOS
(called Z-DOS for this, but it is the same as PCDOS they tell
me) will drive a CP/M user to drink.  Fast.

	Does anyone know how to make a bootable copy of a system
disk in MSDOS or ZDOS?  The procedures in the manual will NOT
make a disk that will boot.  My backup copy was made when the
BATCH executive command processor took over when running the
distribution disk; you have no choice but to make a backuyp (and
if you didn't have a blank disk handy I guess you'd just be
sol); but it always formats first, then copies the SECOND
distributoin disk, then erases t he batrch processor, finally
making a bootable copy; it isn't obvious what commands it uses
to do that, and none of the commands in the summary of ZDOS
commands tell me.  DSKCOPY copies data only.  SYS doesn't make a
bootable disk.  Everything formats before you copy whether you
want it to or not.

	Indeed, I think the inventors of MSDOS must HATE
computer users.  Each time you boot the system it gives you an
obsolete date (which I guess you cannot change ever?) and time,
and insists that you give it the new date and time.  The command
structure is needlessly complex, and sufficiently like yet
unlike CP/M that it is obvious that the writer was familiar with
CP/M and did things deliberately different.  As for example,
Copy *.* B: will go from the logged in disk to B and copy all
files to B.  Why change it to that?  Presumably to be different
(or perhaps to avoid a lawsuit)?

	I have a demo disk for the Z-100 that shows magnificent
color graphics, but alas, I cannot run Z-basic.  I cannot
because I have only ONE bootable system disk (other than the
original) and it is full.  All attempts to make a new bootable
disk with fewer files on it so that I could PIP (oops, COPY)
ZBASIC over to something so I could actually RUN it have been
frustrated by ZDOS.
	The documents are for the most part the best I have ever
seen.  They are very clear.  Everything is fine, except that it
just don't work, making me wonder if it's hardware; only all the
demonstration stuff runs fine, and it seems unlikely therefore.
	I thnk they tried to be cute.  But maybe not.  Whatever
it is, I quit working with the Z-100 before I began screaming; I
was taken back five years to when i HATED computers, and
everything about them (trying to get a TRS-80 going for the boys
can do that to you; TRS-DOS and MSDOS have sme remarkable
similarities, making me wonder if descendents of the
Marq	uis de Sade went into programming?  Or the same
descendent?)

	I think I am going to love the Z-200.  Alas there is no
CP/M 86 for it> I am tempted to put the machine aside until
there is.  Better a devil I know...

Meanwhile if anyone knows how to make a bootable disk--what is
the equivalent  of "SYSGEN" in ZDOS -- I'll be pleased.  Alas
the explicit cookbook instructions in the manual do not produce
a bootable disk..

	Someone I know needs a version of MODEM for his Xerox 820.
Within the last couple of weeks or so, I remember seeing a message from
someone saying that there was such a thing.  Who was it?

Yes, I know, you can modify the current version of MODEM7 so that it
works on ANYTHING, but that's not really the trouble.  The trouble is
that the Xerox apparently does not like to go into 8-bit data mode, so
I can't transfer .COM or .?Q? files.  Maybe someone knows how to do
this.

I just took delivery on a Corvus 20 MB S-100 system which I got at a real
bargain price. Too bad it arrived DOA! Both the busy and fault lights remain
on continously! Well, it is at the loal Corvus servicing dealer, and I would
hope I will have it back in a few days. In the meantime, I would like to
get in contact with any fellow Corvus/S100 users to compare hints, kinks,
etc. By the way, the subsystem is packaged without any schematics, and the
technical documentation is minimal to say the least. Hopefully this is
the only feature lacking!

You will want to have a chat with Ron Fowler's co-worker Al Jewer at
the Fort Fone File Folder RCPM is Wisconsin.  He changed the Corvus
CBIOS to reduce the CP/M group size and (I believe) increase the
number of directory names.  Tom Churbuck (he died a few months back,
did you know that?) was the one who originally did that work.  He
didn't like the 8k group size that Corvus had picked.  I didn't like
that group size either.  It wastes a lot of disk space when you have
many small files.

One company I do work for has a 10Mb unit hooked up to a TRS-80
Model II, but as far as I can tell the drives are the same for
all computers and only the small host adapter changes from one
to the next, so my comments should apply to your unit.

We have had nothing but problems when dealing with Corvus. They
were over a month late in getting us the unit, and they didnt
seem to care. They were even nasty on the phone when we called
to find out what was going on. On a scale of 1 to 10 I would
rate their customer service a 3.

The hardware has worked Ok so far. We have had it for about
four months and the only trouble we have had with the system
is with the video recorder, which Corvus didnt supply. No
instructions came with our Mirror so we had to call Corvus
to find out what goes where. I dont know if this normal. I
would hope not because when I called I was warned that if I
put the wrong plug in a certain socket I would fry the Mirror
and possibly my hard disk as well.

If you complain loud enough they wee send you a working copy
(done on a dot matrix printer) or their tech manual. The Xerox
copy that I got was hard to read and the printer it was done on
should have had a new ribbon. The manual assumes you are using
an apple, but most of the info applies to all models, just
ignore the Pascal listings in the back.

{I apologize if people get repeats.  The mailer croaked on the
address fylstra at SRI-TSCA.  I don't think it mailed to the
list, but who knows...}


I have the Hayes 1200 and am very pleased with it so far.  The
only problem I had is that the first unit I received died
after 2 hours.  Hayes replaced the unit after a little griping
about a two week service turn-around on a modem I'd had for
one day.  Apparently, things are a bit confused down there
(Georgia).  The company recently moved across the street into
a new building.  

<This info applies to both Smartmodems>

The Hayes has two modes:  command mode and online mode.
In online mode, all characters sent to the modem are sent also
to the comm line.  After dialing a telephone number and
detecting a carrier, the modem goes into this mode.  It
notifies the computer (or terminal) by returning a result
code.   The result codes are either verbose (i.e. CARRIER, NO
CARRIER, OK) or terse (ascii 30H-35H --0-5).  Selection is
done by the users.

When in command mode, commands are sent to the modem by
preceeding them with AT which lets the modem determine the
baud rate, parity, and word length.  The command follows.  The
command terminator can be set thru software.  The default is a
carriage return.  

When the system is "online," the modem is put into command
mode by sending three "escape" characters followed by a pause.
The default escape character is "+".  BTW, the escape
characters are passed thru to the online system.  Because of
this, people complain about having to send "garbage" down the
comm line to to get the modem to do anything.  However, I
don't see any other way to use one port and be able to send
the modem commands while online.  Many modems do not allow
commands to be sent while online.  The Hayes, since it allows
you to select which character is the "escape" handles it the
best way that I can see.  The manual seems to say that either
end of the link can send the escape sequence.  This bothers me
and I have yet to be able to confirm it.  You can set the
modem so that it doesn't accept commands while online and do a
disconnect using DTR (I believe).

Here's a brief example of connecting to a system using a
program to send the commands:

1) Send ATZ (reset)
2) Wait for OK.  If no OK, send escape and wait for OK.
3) Set up modem params (duplex, dialing rate, escape codes,
default line end (CR and LF -- easier to detect result codes
in the data stream)
4) Send dial command
5) Wait for result code.
6) If connect, go into data mode.  Otherwise, No connection or
error (shouldn't happen unless the program is bad)
7) Send data.  Check CD (carrier detect).  When dropped, look
for No carrier result code indicating lost connection.

To hand up, send escape, wait for result (toss echos), then
send ATH (hang up), wait for OK.

I have found that since the Smartmodem is designed for "human
speed" commands, when sending commands to the modem, use echo
mode and wait for each character to be echoed before
continuing.

All in all, I really like the modem.  The only negative about
the 212 part is that if you are using it as an answer modem,
it does an auto-speed detect and switches speeds.  The result
code it sends is at the speed that the last command was sent
at, but then the modem may SWITCH SPEEDS to accommodate the
calling speed.  The program must be set-up to reset the uart
to the appropriate speed or the modem and RS232 will be out of
sync.

BTW, the modem does morse code also...

Let me know if you have any more questions.  The documentation
is acceptable and just about everything is software
selectable! -r

Another 103/212 modem that might interest is the recently released Racal-Vadic
VA212PA.  It has all of the "normal" features: auto dial/auto answer, ring
detection, speed detection upon answer, etc.  It also has the ability to store and
link numbers in it's internal memory.  With this feature, one may link two or
more numbers in memory so that if one of these numbers is busy the modem will
automatically try to call  the next number in the link.  It defaults to DTMF
dialing, but if the dial one is still present after the first digit is sent it
automatically switches to pulse dialing.  Dial sequence is upwards compatable
with the VA3451PA, so any software which will dial the 3451 should be able to
dial the 212 with little change (UUCP took me 5 minutes, and now it will dial
either one).  It's all contained in a nice package which will fit under the
telephone, and has an alphanumeric LCD display which displays modem status. 
The only price that I've seen is $795.

        To keep the interested people abreast of what is  happen-
ing  wrt  the  ZCPR2  release,  the following is a summary of the
status of the system at this time.  As much as I  would  like  to
release  it  now,  I  don't  feel it would be good or fair to the
users to receive a release and then receive  an  upgrade  shortly
thereafter,  so  I am again delaying the release until everything
is finished.  Soon, I hope, but I'm  not  even  guessing  anymore
with all this travel coming up.

Item                    Status
----                    ------
ZCPR2 itself            Done except for cosmetic doc changes
ZCPR2 utilities         30+ are done, 2 to go
ZCPR2 online doc (HLP)  Done except for cosmetic changes (250K+)
ZCPR2 Ins Manual        Now being reviewed and modified; 90%+ done
ZCPR2 Concepts Manual   Now being reviewed and modified; 90%+ done
ZCPR2 User's Guide      Derived from HLP files, should be done soon
ZCPR2 Rationale         Not anywhere near completion
ZCPR2 CAI Course        Long way to go


        I feel that that Rationale manual and the CAI course  are
not  all  that  important on first release, so I may go ahead and
release the system without them.  The other items, however,  must
be included in the first release.

Instead of splitting your file into smaller units, I suggest that you
try to compact your files.  Compact programs typically compress files
using  a Huffman  code.   The amount of  compression  to be  expected
depends  on the  type of  file being  compressed.  Typical  values of
compression are:  Test (38%), Pascal Source (43%), C Source (36%) and
Binary (19%).  These values are the percentages of file bytes reduced
(Courtesy of the Unix Programmer's Manual).

Check out the U.S. Robotics modems. Their functionally
equivalent model to the DC Hayes cost about $100 lesser
(list price) than the best discount price I have seen
for the DC Hayes.
	Also their 1200 baud only( with the usual features)
is only $400. I have one of these and it is working wonderfully
for over 8 months now. Their delivery time from my call
was, amazingly 2 Hrs. They had their local rep deliver it to me at
no extra charge. Their telephone # is 312-733-0497

I have a Cromemco System 3 with CDOS and want to run some CP/M
software. Cromemco's literature refers to CDOS as "upwards-compatible
with CP/M versions up to 1.3". Does anyone know how do they diverge
after that? In particular, I need to run something that is advertised
as "running under CP/M 2.2". Are disks formats different or can I read
CP/M formatted floppys using CDOS?

Also, is there an *official* version of CP/M available for the
Cromemco machines? I heard something about an obscure company
[to me] having CP/M 2.xx for Cromemco, but I want something out
of Digital Research or (?) Lifeboat, i.e. from someone with a
reputation to protect and a (staffed) complaints/technical queries
department. 

I am especially interested in hearing from someone who has CP/M
running in h(er/is) Cromemco machine and if there is any hassle
mounting it/switching from CDOS and back/etc.

Please reply directly to me as I am not in the info-cpm list.

Subject: Need advice on WordStar Modification
 
PROBLEM: To enable SUPERSCRIPT/SUBSCRIPT for a NEC8023A.
 
The  non-Daisy  mods  section  allows insertion of a user-defined
string for super/subscript at ROLUP  &  ROLDOW.   But  the  space
provided is too small to accomodate the complex string needed for
the NEC8023A.
 
GOOD  IDEA  THAT  DID  NOT  WORK: On assumption that some routine
loads string at ROLUP (& ROLDOW) into DE or HL and then sends  to
the  printer, searched (using DASM) WordStar for the addresses of
these strings.  Had I  found  them,  would  have   revised  those
addresses  to  new  locations  in  the  ample space that WordStar
provides for user-defined routines -- that should have  done  it.
But could not find them, and now am stymied on how to proceed.
 
Suggestion,  anyone?   Please  respond direct to STORK at MIT-MC.
If solution is found, will post to net.

  I am trying to get an ids-microprism to work with the ibm-pc.  The text
and fancy fonts seem to work (though not perfectly), but no matter what I
do, the printer refuses to enter the graphics mode.

  Has anyone out there had any experiences with the microprism?  It looks
like a great printer, but if the graphics can't be easily used, it might
not be worth the money..

Please respond to me, as I`m not on all the lists

I need a PASCAL implementatin of a reasonable matrix inverter
for matrices of arbitrary size.  Has anyone written a decent
algorithm for same?  Payment in autographed book or some such.
Urgent need.  Thanks .

See the file in AR61:cpm; at MIT-MC named MDM7xx FIX.
The changes in this file fix the false dialling bug upon retry
in MODEM796 and above (including MDM701 and 702)..

I bought the P&T advanced command processor
from them at the CPM-83 show last week in San Francisco.  It
has most of the features of ZCPR for a single user, except
for the bulletin-board related security features.  It has the
advantage that you can put it anywhere, including drive A of
a hard disk, and warm boots at the end
of programs are practically instantaneous.  It also
comes with a new 'SUB' which has most of the features of
supersub.
It is about $75 or less.  I like it.
P&T also showed CPM-68 which will be out in a couple of months.
They are ready, but Digital Research has a couple of mods to make.
It comes with C and uses standard 68000 mnemonics.  Presumably a lot
of 16 bit cp/m-86 software will also have the same hooks as cpm-68, if
the source code is compilable to 68000.
Tandy was showing CPM-3 for the Mod 16 in Z-80 mode.
It is coming out in a couple of weeks.  The amazing thing is that
Tandy finally has gone to CP/M in addition to TRSDOS. They have
finally reformed.  The new Mod 12 is very nice and can be had with
Mod 16 68000 cards.  Again it is a sign that Tandy has reformed; it
can be had with a card cage accessibly by users from the back via a
few simple thumb-wheels.  No more 'use only our stuff or
lose your warranty and service.'

  This message is to thank the several people who responded to
my eairlier request about how to transfer files from the
mainframes to my micro, and to condense that advice for others
who might be interested. Most notable of the advisors was the 
info received from Bill Rizzi <RIZZI at ISIB> and Frank Wancho
<FJW at MIT-MC>.
   The best single piece of advice I can give is to get the
file modem.doc from SRI-KL, print it and save it!To do this:
    FTP
    *SRI-KL
    *LOGIN ANONYMOUS XYZ
    *ASCII
    *GET <BILLW>MODEM.DOC
       (to local file) MODEM.DOC
    *DIR <BILLW>                   Mightt as well get this
       (to local file)BILLS.DIR    dir while your here.
    *BYE
    [C
Now typ it out to your printer. The major subheadings
of this 13 page file are:
   TOPS-20
   UNIX
   VAX running VMS
   IBM PC
   TRS MOD I II & III
   APPLE
   CPM
   ATARI
   A Tutorial on prococol
It tells you what programs apply to the various systems and
where to get them!!!
   As for me I can't report success as yet. With Bill and Franks
help I do have a CPM version of MODEM which runs on the TOPS-20
in my space and ready to go. But at almost the exact point of
file Xfer the serial port died and my machine is now being
repaired. I am back on my TRS at the moment, and without a
MODEM80 program can't handle the protocol. So any of you who
are successful and find any additional
nuances which need to be overcome, I would appriciate the
feedback.

UMODEM is in the UNIX archive under CPM.

CPM, of course, is a directory on MIT-MC.

Can anyone point me to an interface, either S100 or RS232 to
allow my system to control BSR remote switches?

If not S100 or RS232 I would still be interested in other less
easy methods.

	Thanks!

Re:   MODEM797 bug?

I had a little trouble using MODEM797 and was hoping that
you might have a little help for me.  While transferring
files in the bulk mode I inadvertently entered this command:
  'TB A:*.*'    (Instead of the S for send I was thinking
T for transmit.  It erased all of the files on the diskette
and opened one with the name: ????????.???.  I recovered
all but the first file in the directory because the group
map for ????????.??? had been set to all zeros, and was
entered where my first file had been.

I'd like to be the one to fix it, but really not good
enough with assembler to do it. Any help would be apprec-
iated. I know, Iknow, Don't use the T, use the S.

Regards,    Bruce Kargol
