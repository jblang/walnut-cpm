We are using our micros as intelligent terminals to both shared minis and
to a large host.  One of our number is having difficulty with noise in
his communications with the host.  I would like to correspond with 
anyone who has experience with - has written - error-checking commo
routines.  All we have to work with is an echo from the host, but that
ought to provide enough power to do the job.

Re:   [W8SDZ: [bridger: squeezing MC CPM files-HEXIFY]]

The HEXIFY source is on MC in AR4:GZ;HEXIFY MIDAS.  I doubt it will
do you any good.

COM files are stored on ITS as four 8-bit bytes per PDP-10 word, left
justified.  The first word is a file-type identifier and it is 446353300000
octal.  This particular packing of 8 bit bytes into pdp-10 words is pretty
standard, so if your FTP has a binary mode, it will probably do the right
thing, i.e. give you the correct sequence of 8-bit bytes coming out of the FTP.
If that is the case, the first 4 bytes should be: 223, 072, 330, 0 (octal).
These come from the id word above and are not part of the com file proper, i.e.
should be discarded before downloading to a CP/M system.

Now, if you don't have binary mode in your FTP, or if the binary mode is such
that you get something other 223,072,330,0 as first four bytes when FTPing COM
files (meaning that the server is using some other byte packing), it might
still be possible to FTP the files and reconstruct the original from that.
(The only problem might be CRLF vs. LF transformations in ascii mode).  All you
need to do figure out how the server unpacks the bytes and then "undo" it.  I'd
be happy to help out if you have trouble figuring this out.  Just let me know
what the first few bytes are when you FTP a com file.  But before you go
writing any code, make sure there is no way to make FTP win directly.

There is a problem checking just the echo from the host. Many
times, the noise may only cause incorrect characters on your
receive line while the host received and retransmitted
correctly. Some attempts I've seen have tried to "fix" xmit
errors using deletes to kill the bad chars and then
retransmitting. But, if line noise was the problem, you may be
deleting correct text.  One option is to issue a line delete
and resend the entire line.  Of course, this doesn't help if a
character was garbled into a line terminator (<CR> on most
systems).

All in all, the problem is PRETTY MESSY.  Sometimes you can
tailor to the application.  But, without some type of
checksumming or CRC, you are still going to get errors thru.
And, when using something like a text editor, the protocol has
to be careful when "correcting" to take into account screen
reformatting and the like.  All in all, not a pleasant task.

Good luck. -r

MIT-AI and the source for V2.0 is on MIT-MC, but neither is any help since
I do not have any version of C to compile the source with.  Alternatively,
is there an ASM source for Small-C V1.0 that I can get to bootstrap myselft
up to V2.0?

Additionally, where can I find source and object for Small-VM, Small-SHELL,
and a sample STDIO.ASM?  Any pointers would be appreciated.  For those of

     I have written some software (Z80 assembly code) that checks what comes
back from the host to make sure it's valid.  I'll be glad to send it to anyone
who wants it -- it's pretty short (or I'll post it to Info-CPM if there's
enough interest).  It may take a while though because I have to wait for my
computer to come back from the factory -- it's an Osborne-1 getting a double
density upgrade.
     I do have an observation though:  I seem to get fewer errors when I turn
off echo at the host and use checksums.  I'm not sure whether this is because
of some kind of feedback in the phone lines (anybody know if that's possible?)
or just that my micro is slow in receiving characters when it's trying to
send them at the same time.  My gut feeling says it's the latter.
     I have been playing around with calling bigger machines with my micro
for four to five months now and have NEVER had problems with the bit rate
affecting my error count (i.e. 1200bps is as reliable as 300) and this includes
long-distance phone lines.  Before I got my modem, I heard people complain
about 1200bps being unreliable all the time.  Am I just lucky or do the rest
of you have the same experiences?

company, called Continuum, which sells the Kaypro II with a 10MB hard disk

        I just did a CRC check on all the COM files for ZCPR2  in
AR82:FJW.   They are all current versions.  For those of you with
the Installation Manual, you will find that the CRCs match as ad-
vertised  in  Appendix  A to all files except MKDIR.  The CRC for
MKDIR is C27F, and it is different because a glitch was found  in
SYSLIB's  SORT  routine  and  I corrected it.  MKDIR was the only
ZCPR2 program which I found to use SORT, so I simply  reassembled
it.  Source to MKDIR is the same as before, and only the COM file
is different.

        AR19:CPM now contains the current version of SYSLIB,  viz
2.5.  CRCs match.

There is a new modem program on MC, called :MMODEM.  Do
	 :MMODEM ?
for usage details.  This program imposes a much smaller load on the system than
LMODEM.  However, MMODEM doesn't currently provide the special 7-bit mode that
LMODEM has.  If there is sufficient demand, I can put it in.

Since this is of interest to ITS users only, future annoucements regarding
MMODEM will not be sent to INFO-CPM.  If you use this program, let me know and
I'll put you on INFO-MMODEM where such announcements will go.

I thought it might be useful to advise the net of the location of the
on-line file storage of Richard Conn's ZCPR2 replacement CCP and its
associated documentation and utilities on MC:

	AR80:FJW - This archive contains ZCPR2 proper as well as the
header file required for assembly and some of the documentation.

	AR81:FJW - The .HLP (help) files for ZCPR2, to be used in
conjunction with HELP.COM.

	AR82:FJW - ZCPR2 utilities. The object file only is provided
in most cases due to storage capacity limitations. Source to these
files will soon be available from SIG/M.

	AR83:FJW - ZCPR2 documentation. The balance of documentation not
present in AR80 is in this archive. There still reamains a file or two
which I will be uploading shortly. Note that most of the documentation
has been uploaded in squeezed form due to its size and should be downloaded
or FTP'd as a binary file and later unsqueezed using Richard Greenlaw's
USQ program which is available in the CPM directory on MC.

Trenton Computer Festival (15-17 Apr).  The ZCPR2 and SYSLIB  do-
cumentation  is  expected to reside in two volumes of an n-volume
set of documentation on public domain software they are creating.
The cost per volume is expected to be around $8.

        The NY Amateur Computer Group is a not-for-profit organi-
zation, and any profits from this sale are to go into funding fu-
ture club activities.

        I will drop a message to the net  after  the  sales  have

A new version of the MODEM7 series, MDM705, is now available on MIT-MC.
This version has several different user overlay files to make customization
easy.  You don't really need the MDM705.ASM file (which is now 130k long)
unless you plan to modify or improve the program.  All you need is
MDM705.COM (or HEX if you can't FTP COM files from MC), and the appropriate
user overlay file.  The following are excerpts from Irv Hoff's information
on this new version.

Bug reports to INFO-MODEM7@MIT-MC, please.  This is a special mailing list
for maintainers of the MODEM7 series.

---from MDM705.MSG---

     MDM705 is now available on this system.  After the
MODEM7xx program became MODEM799, a decision was made to
name the next version MDM700.  This also allows it to be
placed on the COMPUSERVE system which limits all file
names to 6 characters including any revision numbers.
     While catering to S-100 systems using the plug-in
PMMI auto-answer, auto-dial modem, it works great on most
other systems as well.  (My own equipment uses an external 
Bell 212A modem with push button manual dialing.)
     This is likely the most sophisticated modem program
available for CP/M users.  An instruction guide is in-
cluded in the group of programs, called MDM705.DOC.
     Look at the short file called MDM705.INF for an
explanation of the various programs in the family.  It
will tell which may be most useful in adapting to your
equipment.  It also gives typical values for many units.

TOPIC :  MDM705 MODEM PROGRAM INSTALLATION INFORMATION
FROM  :  IRVIN M. HOFF
DATE  :  03/03/83


       This program is based on one originally written by Ward Christ-
ensen in Sept. 1977.  It has since undergone a considerable number of
changes.  Two of the latest were (1) printer control while in the "T"
(Terminal) mode and (2) combining the macro library into the program to
eliminate extra files -- also allowing assembly with ASM as well as MAC
or other popular assemblers.

NOTE:  Special configuration files are being added for specific types of
       computers.  Several are available as shown below.  Others will be
       provided for popular computers using external modems.  This file
       will be updated accordingly.  (The MDM705CF.ASM general configure

        NOTE:  The MDM705CF overlay file has additional information
               permitting easy adaptation to the Heath/Zenith units
               using the 8250 I/O.

MDM705 is designed to work immediately for PMMI users with no changes.
(Some preferences might be different from those preset, however.)

        When ready to use the program, type 'H' (for 'HELP'), hit RET
and it will display helpful information on the commands.  There are so
many commands there are several pages.  You can abort the display with
a CTL-C.  (One of the most useful features being CTL-P to toggle your
printer on/off) 

        The program has received numerous worthwhile optional features
in the past several months.

Well, V2.0 was posted to net.sources in source form and without CP/M STDIO
compatibility.  Without a C compiler, I can't use the source.  I need a COM
file.  My only hope is either that somebody has a .COM file already for
CP/M or that I can get my hands on a V1.0 CP/M .COM file.  Failing that, I
can get a 8080 version of the soure to V1.0 and use it to generate a
working V1.0 compiler, and then compile V2.0.  Thanks for youe help though.

        ZCPR2 Mod 0.1 and SYSLIB 2.4 are now in SIG/M.   This  is
complete  with all sources, HLP files, object files, and documen-
tation as WordStar files.  This group constitutes Volumes  98  to
107  of  the SIG/M library.  I gave SIG/M a disk last night which
(by itself) provides the files which upgrade this ZCPR2 and  SYS-
LIB set to ZCPR2 Mod 0.3 and SYSLIB 2.5.  This will be coming out
soon in SIG/M.

        They stated at the meeting  that  they  had  SYSLIB  2.3.
They  actually  have  2.4.   The  confusion comes from the User's
Guide referring to 2.3 and the User and Ref manual  referring  to
2.4.  The User's Guide didn't change from 2.3 to 2.4 to 2.5, so I
just didn't change its header.  No doc  change  is  required  for
2.5,  so  2.4  of  the  User and Reference manual is good for 2.5
also.  This is all explained in the Z2SYS-1.MOD file.

        If you ever have a question on what version of SYSLIB you
have  is,  the following code segment (with its appropriate EXTs)
tells you:

		CALL VERSION
		CALL PHL4HC

        This will cause 0204 to be printed if version 2.4, etc.

Courtesy of Danielson.PA@PARC-MAXC, I have Small-C V2.0 for CP/M on MIT-MC
in the archive EJS;AR50:.  I will keep it up-to-date if I receive any fixes
from Mr. Danielson.  In the archive are the *.MAC (your need M80 rather
than ASM to assemble) files necessary to assemble Small-C V2.0 and the
runtime libraries and i/o interface for CP/M.  Then i/o routines have
references to ROM routines (rather than calling CONIN and CONOUT) so these
will have to change.  I'll make these changes soon and upload onto MIT-MC.

Thanks for getting the Small C version 2.0 CP/M files.
I looked them over and found them all to have strings of
control-Z's at the end.  This would probably not have
caused problems with M80, but there were some "$" and
"%" characters at the end too, probably a shell prompt
from a Unix system.  I have cleaned up all the files and
split them into two archives (because they were so large
they exceeded the safe limit for on ARchive device on
MC) and they're now available in the CPM directory.
The archives are named AR76 V2CMAC and AR77 V2CMA2.
If you update them, please use these as the sources.

Has anyone had any experience with a commodore 64 running cp/m?  I
noticed recently that there is a plug in cartridge that allows the base
machine to run (one of) the most popular small computer operating
system.  Is it compatible with everyone elses cp/m?  I also noticed no
ads anywhere for programs in commodore cp/m format.  Does this mean that
it accepts another popular format (apple perhaps) or that it's hard to
find software for it.  Any info would be appreciated.

Hi!
	Well, apparently my previous letter under the same subject never
got distributed...
	
	Anyway, I am looking for anyone with experience with a California
company called Continuum.  They placed an ad in the March Byte for a 
Kaypro with a 10MB hard-disk, selling for $2795.  This seemed a little
under-priced, so I would like to know if anyone has any info about them
before I buy the Kaypro (If I ever do)

	Also, I'm looking for anyone who has used 'The CP/M Card' from
Advanced Logic Systems.  This is a z-80 card for the Apple ][, and it
comes with CP/M 3.0.  Any opinions/comments are welcome.

		Thanks muchly in advance,

Several times I have tried to transfer an Apple text file to Apple CP/M
and edit it using Mince.  Mince always seems to either cough up the file
with a "read error or no EOF" message, or it takes the file and then
displays it as a single unformatted character string, with ctl-m and
ctl-"at" shown literally.  What gives?

PS.  If it is a basic file and I do a load followed by a save,a then
mince likes it fine.

I ran into a similar problem when converting a large text file under CP/M
from WordStar to The Final Word.  The problem was that some software uses
the high level bit for additional attributes and TFW only recognizes "virgin"
character representations.  Solution:  use PIP to ZERO the high level bit
and she's a worka justa fine.

	I am glad to say that I have been able to create a version of
the commercially available Ascom program that runs on the Rainbow 100.
It uses the CPMUG (CP/M User Group ie. Ward Christensen) protocol as
an option and I was successful in transferring files from a Kaypro II 
running modem7 version 96 to the DEC.

	Now the bad news - Ascom does not properly terminate at the end
of file transfer- it left the Kaypro dangling until it timed out.
The same thing happened when I tried to get Ascom to talk
to Whizlink (yet another Christensen protocol implementation) on a
Toshiba system.  Even worse, the Rainbow could not send a file to the
Kaypro due to bad sector # in header messages.  Most people are 
interested in getting things onto the Rainbow, however.

	This brings up the problem of various packages that SAY they use
the Christensen protocol and do for the most part, except for things
like end of file, etc.  It's bad enough that modem7 has so many
versions, but at least they can talk to each other properly.

	I heard from several people who have an 8088 version of modem7
in assembly language, but never received the source.  If I manage
to grab it somewhere, I will attempt to configure it for the Rainbow
and make it available to any interested parties.

Does anyone know of a disk copy program that works on the SuperBrain
QD?  SuperBrains are delivered without any disk copy program-yuk!
Prefer free of course but willing to pay nominally for a program
that will do the job.

The "compatibility problems" between various programs which say they
use the Christensen protocol are probably caused by timing errors in
the program.  Some well-meaning, but misguided, person updating MODEM2
and MODEM7 changed the 10 second timing to 2 or 3 seconds about a year
or two back.  There was a VERY good reason for it being 10 seconds -
to allow for slower disk systems' time it takes to write to the disk.
This is particularly critical on mini-floppies - some of which have as
slow as 30 milliseconds track-to-track seek time (I know, I have one -
the Micropolis Mod II).  The result is (in some cases) that the
end-of-file byte from the sender is lost by the receiving end.  The
solution is simple - restore the timing back to the 10 seconds that
Ward Christensen and I agreed was optimal.  Those commercial programs
that don't work were probably based upon the public-domain versions
that were available at the time they were written - probably the ones
that had 2-3 second timing values.  If you contact the authors of the
commercial programs, they should be able to tell you the addresses of
where to patch the delays.

Your comments about MODEM7 having so many versions are well taken -
however (flame on) if the program had been written right in the first
place (and had been "clean" source code instead of the poorly
formatted version that was released originally) many of the revisions
would have been unnecessary.  It is inexcusable that the author of
MODEM7 REMOVED ALL OF WARD CHRISTENSEN'S COMMENT LINES in the file!
This made it almost impossible to service the program for updates/bug
fixes, and in my opinion, caused updating it to be more prone to
having bugs. (Flame off).

The present version of MODEM7 (MDM705) is finally in reasonable
condition and has MANY new and useful features - a lot of which are
especially useful here on the net (i.e., the terminal mode now allows
ALL control characters to be passed to the modem, allows toggling the
printer on and off, and has a buffer for the printer in case it's
slower than the incoming data on the modem.  Mind you, I'm not saying
it's perfect, but it finally in good enough shape that I've stopped
recommending MODEM2xx to newcomers.  With the configuration files it
is now no longer necessary to download the .ASM source file.  I
consider that a major step forward and I would hope that people will
not talk down this program simply because it has gone through so many
versions.  That would be throwing away a lot of good work!

Tony Petsch wrote a transfer program that will send any kind of
file fdr om any CP/M system to any CP/M system (provided that
similar ports are available to connect the two machines.)  It
works for KAYPRO and Otrona and I presume will work for Rainbow
although at moment I do not have a Rainbow.
	I wot e about 8500 words on the subject of file
transfers in CP/M (logical and physical devices and all that
crap) which apparently is being included as the documentation
for this program.
	I expect there are other and simpler ways to send files
from one machine to another, but I have not yet seen one that
was completely reliable.  (PIP will work with short text files,
of courswe, but not long ones and not  binary).
	Tony's program sends in Intel Hex format (it hexifies)
and thus does not require any thing on the receiving end other
than PIP or a PIIP-like utility to catch the parts of the
program as they come across (this goofy sender chops the file
sent into pieces short enough that the receiving system can
catch them and write to disk, then open a new files to catch the
next part, etc; then one uses PIP to concatenat the whole mess.)
	Presumably there are other methods that would work?
	I am not being hesitant about where to get this thing T
ony wrote, but it is only availabel commercially and I gather
one should not advertise here; I invite someone to tell a
non-commercial source for a universal transporter...

DO NOT USE PIP TO ZERO the 8th bit for word star or you will
have a screwed up file with goofy carriage returns and plenty
spaces where you don't want them and no way yo format it
properly.
	It's easy enough to write a filter that will eliminate
the extra spaces and extra carriage returns WordStar puts in,
and output your file in the format that your new edityor wants
it; do that, instead of using PIP....

    Terrific!  I called Priority 1 this morning to ask when CPM-68
    would be available for Godbout/CompuPro systems and the answer
    was, "six months from now."  So I guess I can play tiddly-winks
    with the 68K board until then.

    But seriously, given a cross-assembler (which I'd either write 
    or purchase), how easy or difficult wo it be for someone who
    has a lot of CBIOS experience with CPM-80 and CPM-86 to write
    a BIOS and install CPM-68 using a CPM-80 or CPM86 system as the
    development machine?  I'm particularly interested in comments 
    from those who have actually done the job (mknox@utexas-11 et al).

    Also, does anyone know the chance of getting one of these so-called
    beta versions that everyone saw running on CompuPro stuff at CPM-83?

Jerry, have you EVER tries ANY version of MODEM2 or MODEM7?  If you
need to transfer files from one CP/M-80 system to another this one
will do it - with OR WITHOUT modems.  It works just as well on RS-232
ports tied back-to-back.  MODEM7 (available here on MC  as MDM705) has
a "batch transfer" option which would let you do a whole disk if you
wanted to.  I hope you'll try it soon.

I just wrote a file transfer program for UT which works in a manner
similar to what you described, Jerry.  Except it is really intended to
do micro - mainframe transfers (MODEM7 didn't quite fit the bill).
There is no reason it can't do micro - micro transfers but, since we
have only one micro, I can't test that aspect.

It uses intel hex as the transfer protocol EXCEPT that I have added
ACKs and NAKs.  If you just want to send intel hex w/o ACKing and
NAKing then comment out a few lines and presto!

The program is in FORTRASH (at least the file transfer subroutines)
and since we have made the same source work under CP/M, TOPS20, UNIX,
VAX VMS and our own CDC Cyber O.S., I'd say its portable.

It's all done sans the spit and shine on the documentation (take a
week or two) and anyone who wants it may have a copy.  Although, as
you can guess, it is SLOWer than MODEM7.  But it takes about three
days to bring up on a different host, a claim I don't believe can be
made by non-CP/M MODEM7 users.  This program is a real idiot, by design.

John.

Things have improved.  I have a C cross-compiler and a couple of
cross assemblers for the 68000.  I'll be writing a boot eprom, perhaps
a low-level monitor, and a BIOS.  I'll probably write the BIOS in C and the
rest in assembler.  I'll be able to finish all of that before Compupro
does, I'm sure.

Although you are technically correct, the extra <CR/LF>s don't mean anything
to The Final Word when it goes into its formatting routines.  Same for the
extra spaces.  I just took the easy way out.

P.S., the reason for changing the document from WordStar to The Final Word
was to get camera ready copy on a proportionally spacing Diablo 1650 for an

There is a noncommercial product similar to the one you  describe,
Jerry.  Written in BDS C, it is called PH.C.  It, too, hexifies the
source (binary) file for transmission to the target machine, which
need only have PIP to receive it.  It has been around for about a 
year and is available on better RCP/M systems everywhere.  Offhand,
I believe it is on MC, but I don't have a copy of the directory handy
while I'm writing this.

works fine if you have the programs on both machines.  Not so

The APPLE Users Group of El Paso, TX sponsors an RBBS on a NorthStar
Hard Disk CP/M system running TSS/C (certainly a contradiction in
terms).  The system has been on a hiatus since it was converted back
in early January, but is now back up with even more available space
than ever - 6 2MByte logical disk drives for a total of 12MBytes.

To kick it off, I have loaded about half the system already with 60
.LBR files (5698K) of SQueezed files downloaded from MC and other
sources over the past two years or so.  All the files are up-to-date
as of yesterday, and include the latest collection of ZCPR2 files
(except the SYSLIB set), and MODEM 705 (absolutely the last version of
MODEM 7 I will ever download), and take up most of the B:, C:, and D:
drives.  Both LDIR and LMODEM (LU-MODEM) are available to help you
make selective downloads if you do not wish to download an entire .LBR
file using XMODEM.

The system will be up 24-hours a day, seven days a week, and presently
supports only 110 and 300 baud, with a PMMI to be installed "soon".
The number is 915-533-2202, no ringback.  Wade through the RBBS and
into CP/M and have at it!

This message is also to serve as notice that I am rescinding the offer
I made last May to supply this set of files to anyone who sends me a
package of NorthStar Quad disks and return postage.  For those who
send me their disks some time ago, this same collection will be out in
the mail in a couple of days.

Yes, there is an easy way of getting started with MODEM2 or MODEM7.
It's a program called MBOOT.  It's relatively short (about 6k) of
source code for a receive-only (no-frills) version of Ward's MODEM2
program.  It's easily typed in on the target machine.  All that's
required is knowledge of the port number being used, the bits to test for
send and receive.  It assumes that you have already initialized the
port for the desired baud rate, 8 data bits, one stop bit, and no
parity.  This is a bit more preparation than using the simple PIP HEX
file approach, but after it's up and running you can transfer any
program fast and with full error checking.  After you get MBOOT
running you can use it to get MODEM7 and you'll have full batch
transfer capability.  MBOOT is available on MIT-MC as:

AR60:CPM;MBOOT 3ASM

It is also available on every RCPM system across the country, and has
been published in Dr. Dobbs Journal.

Instead of using PIP to zero the 8th bit, print the file to a
DISK file with justification turned off.  This will remove all
of the WordStar characters, ie; Soft Spaces, Hyphens, Carriage
Returns, and leave you with a clean, editable file without all
the extra blanks between words. - Bob

Move-It is from Woolf Software, 23842 Archwood St, Canoga Park, CA
91307 (213) 703-8112.  Probably a local call for you.

It was reviewed in July 82 Interface Age (very favorably) and has been
improved some since.  It works extremely well, and has nice features
such as the ability to get DIR listings from either the remote or loacl
computer, messages, terminal mode, wildcard use (e.g. GET *.COM), and
error control.  Really what you want for downloading files from
8" systems to the multitudinous 5" formats, as well as for general
comm use. Don't remember the price, but in vicinity of $125 I think.

I'll have to see if I can get theirs and mention it; but don't b

I'll get it and look at it; but I think you over estimate the
degree of informat ion most people have, and their ability to
manipulate this stuff.

It is  easy enough to tool up and learn these things for a few
days (at least it is for me) but it is also very easy to forget it..

    I have a Public Key "Trapdoor" crypto system that works fine on
    a Z-80 micro.

    At least it seems to work fine -- I have no way to know how
    secure the code generated really is.

    For those interested:  the public key (mine) is under
    MC:POURNE;PUBLIC kEY and two messages encrypted with it are 
    MC:POURNE;SECRET MSG  (37 words) and
    MC:POURNE;SECRET VITA (1038 words).

    	I'll buy dinner for the first person to tell me the
    secret message (not the vita which is obtainable).  I'd be
    intrested in just how secure this stuff is, and what resources
    are needed to break it (if it can be done).

    	Best,

    will appear in BYTE, but one presumes that by then someone will
    have cracked it if it is crackable..

I don't know if this is news to most people, but I recently found that
one can set up 5 Mb of hard on an S-100 system for about $1000.  $500
for a Morrow Designs controller board (standard Seagate Tech. ST-506
interface, controls up to 4 drives) and $495 for a Western Dynex Corp.
5 Mb REMOVABLE CARTRIDGE drive, advertised in a recent BYTE.  I called
California Digital and they have the Morrow board in stock at $495; the
Western Dynex people said I could buy two of the 5 Mb drives at $495
each (it is the OEM discount price) and the cartridges are $50 a piece.
I also saw a recent ad for a 67 Mb (unformatted) drive for $1500.  So,
5 Mb removable for $1K, 60 Mb non-removable for $2K, including controller.
I think the board comes with sample BIOS code, too.
			Eliot
PS - I may be buying one or both of these in the near future.

DEADLINE is an adventure-like game in which the player is a police
inspector attempting to solve a locked-door murder mystery.  It is
available for various personal computers, including TRS-80, Apple,
Atari, IBM PC, and generic CP/M-80 from Infocom, the folks who gave
us Zork I, Zork II, Zork III, and Starcross (all highly recommended).

I am unable to get very far with DEADLINE (I guess I'm not much of
a detective).  I have the hints published by the Zork User's Group,
which consist entirely of a map of known space, but this doesn't
help.  I would very much appreciate hints from any experienced
DEADLINE players.

The Small-C V2.0 archives on MIT-MC (CPM;AR76: and CPM;AR77:) have been
updated with a new version of the CP/M runtime support (CPM;AR77:RUNTIM
MAC).  All references to ROM routines have been replaced with the
appropriate calls to the BDOS.  The file CC4.MAC was also updated with some
bug fixes from Mr. Danielson in the peephole optimizer.  The new C.HEX file
reflects the changes to RUNTIM and CC4.

Hello,
I was in the middle of MMODEM and it suddenly aborted on
the 40H sector of a 50H sector file... I think what screwed
it up was that I got a msg from Plehn. Looks like MMODEM
doesnt do a TCTYP REFUSE ????

by the way,another hint/tip: If you are on ITS and want
to download a file from the CP/M archive, :COPY it first
from the archive to your disk area and then run MMODEM -
archives take a LOT LONGER to access (esp when on a ITS
other than MC) !!

Later,

The info I quoted recently comes from ads and articles in a recent

drives and their specs.  Just thought people might want to know.

Also, more than one person said that Western Dynex is having problems
and is not yet shipping the 5 Mb drive; silly me, I did not ask them
about delivery.  If I look into it further, I will report back for

MMODEM does do TCTYP REFUSE.  I've installed the current version of MMODEM
on AI.  Let me (not info-cpm) know if the problem still occurs.

This is a total waste of time.  The first thing MMODEM does is copy the file

Keith,

  This message sparked my interest again.

   HOW can I get a source listing of MDM705 FTP'ed to me?

I am vaguely familiar with FTP.   I HAVE ftp'ed to MIT-MC
and gotten a directory listing of CPM; directory.


However, I must be doing something wrong...just can't find the right file...or
I try to FTP and I get garbage.

If you habve time to respond to this msg, could you include a PHOTO
of the procedure...I'm still pretty green at it.  We have a TOPS20 
system here  (prompt: @).

Greatly appreciative,
Tom Carnahan

The below files were moved via FTP from MC to the local UNIX system.  
I tried using the unix usq (xusq.107c) to unsqueeze the files.  
Usq errors with the message: blah.aqm not a SQueezed file.

z2rat.wq
z2rat.wqh
z2ug.wq
z2ug.wqh
z2ug1.wq
zcpr2.23aqm
zcpr2.23lqb

What's up?  This is a 4.1BSD system.  Is there some incompatibility
with usq or FTP or am I doing something wrong?

Thanks,

I'll just follow this with a copy of the program in question.  It has 
enough internal documentation to guide its user; I think 8500 words
on this rather trivial subject is overkill.

The program uses the little-known and little-used block transfer 
mode of PIP which uses XON/XOFF to control transmission.  While this
is a rudimentary and slow way to handle transmission of binary
data, it is good enough to bootstrap modem7 or some such program.

Try it; you'll like it.  It is simple and small, but bigger and
more verbose is not necessarily better.

You need to do the FTP in binary (type image) and then convert that
from ITS format to something that Unix likes.  I've written an ITS to
Unix converter which does the job nicely. Let me know if you need a copy.

Does anyone know if Godbut is working on an implementation of CP/M Plus
(aka 3.0) on the Godbout 8080/z80 hardware? I have great difficulty in
obtaining any meaningful intelligence on what software developments they
have in the hopper, and am loathe to start from scratch here if
someone else is further along than wishful thinking!

Would also of course like to hear about same from G&G or any hackers; perhaps
we could pool our resources? I just received Plus from DR, so they are
indeed shipping; I would like to think that I will be able to do something
other than admire the fancy documentation for the next several months!

Being the individual who hacked xusq107 for 4.1bsd, I can take a  blind
guess at what your problem is.  But since I know absolutely nothing
about FTP I may be way off base.

Usq will fail if you invoke it on a squeezed file that was transferred
using a 7 bit protocol or doing any newline translation.  Is this what
you are doing?  I encountered that problem when I used umodem in the
'text' mode for handling squeezed files; it went away when I started
using the 'binary' mode.

NOTES:

1. Call-back systems are those where a computer and real people
   share the same telephone line.   To contact the people, just
   dial  &  let the phone ring until you  get  an  answer.   To
   contact  the  computer:   (1) dial,  (2) let the phone  ring
   once,  (3) hang up just before the 2nd ring,  & (4) re-dial. 
   Call  back systems are noted as CB,  systems  not  requiring 
   call back are noted as NCB.

2. Baud rates are shown as Bx, where x is a code indicating:
     1= PMMI rates (110-710 baud) ; 2 = 300 baud only
     3= Bell 212A and 300 baud    ; 4 = Vadic 3451 and 300 Baud
     5= Bell 212A, Vadic 3451 and 300 Baud.
   Note  that  the  212A/Vadic  1200 baud  modems  may  not  be   
   compatable with yours. Most of the above systems are   using 
   Vadic  3451 Triple modems,  compatable with both Bell    and 
   Vadic  Standard.  Sign  on  the first time at  300  baud  to   
   determine  the  system capabilities.  Note also that  PMMI's   
   can sometimes be used over 300 baud with 1200 baud  systems.   
   PMMI baud rates are: 110, 300, 450, 600, 710.

3. Alternate Long Distance servies are shown as LDx, where x is 
   a code indicating:
     1= None   2=Sprint   3=MCI   4=ITT
   Whether  a  program  exchange  system is  accessible  by  an   
   a.l.d.s. (=alternative long-distance service) should be con-   
   sidered when planning to modem over long  programs.  Charges   
   on  SPRINT,  ITT/CITYCALL  and MCI are 50-60% of  Ma  Bell's   
   regular long distance rates.

4. Disk  capacity is shown for reference.   Note that disks not 
   noted as HARD may be any combination of floppies,  and  that 
   hard  disks  are generally divided into a number of  logical 
   disks.   Check  the system documentation for  exact  details 
   when logging on.

5. All times listed are local time.

6. NEW SYSOPS: When messaging Jud or Kim with information about
   your system, please include the following data:

   a. Your System's Name (& BBS type)
      (examples: Joe Blow's RBBS, Home Town RCPM/CBBS)
   b. Your System's area code and phone number.
   c. Your Name.
   d. Call Back/No Call Back.
   e. Hours of operation.
   f. Baud rates supported.
   g. Alternative Long Distance Services that can call you.
      (Note that you don't have to subscribe to any, just list
       ones that can call your area.   If you don't know, call
       the local  MCI, SPRINT and/or ITT  offices or their 800
       number and ask 'em.)
   h. Your on-line storage capacity. (Total KB or MB).
   i. Your location. (City, State; State, Area)
   j. Special features and interests, hardware notes, etc.

It  will  greatly  assist  Jud and Kim if  you  can  modem  the 
information  in  a format similar to those already existing  in 
the current listing.

I'm afraid I can't help one helluva lot with the news about CP/M Plus
for Compupro.  They are so hostile out there that I can't even get any
help with my problem of more immediate concern.  All I can go on is
rumor; so far I haven't even heard a rumor about CP/M Plus.

This morning I called the friendly Godbout folk to see if I could get
some tech help for my CPU-68K problems.  (A friend and I, both with 
a lot of 68000 programming experience, failed to get the thing 
working over the weekend).  I was told by the sweet, young thing on
the other end of the phone that I should contact my dealer.  When I
persisted, telling her that my dealer knows as much about software
as my nine year-old nephew and even less about hardware, she told me
that she'd "put me through this time, but I can get into a lot of
trouble for this."  After a suitable delay, Miss Telephone Manners
advised me that none of the tech people were in, "maybe they're in 
a meeting or something."

So you see Godbout is on my **** list at the moment.  Maybe if I send
a copy of this to Jerry Pournelle, he can give me a technique for 
solving the 'Godbout Reachability Problem.'  In the meanwhile, I guess
I'll dust off the logic analyzer...

A company I have dealings with is looking to purchase around 100 microcomputers
for in-house workstations.  They are currently evaluating:

o NEC APC

o IBM-PC

o Heath Z-100

o BMC

o TRS-80 Model-16

They want color and a UNISCOPE terminal emulator, but it isn't mandatory.  They
also want to run CP/M (but don't seem to know that there are different versions
such as CP/M-2.2, CP/M-86, CP/M-68K).  Right now the BMC seems to be the front-
runner because it is color and has the UNISCOPE program which apparently does
work.  I am familiar with the Model-16 and somewhat with the IBM-PC, though 
don't know of a UNISCOPE for either.

Any comments?

By-the-way, I handled the NEC machine a while.  It is not a bad machine, good
graphics, but the CP/M-86 implementation is the pits.  They don't even do disk
blocking/deblocking.  Heads load/unload every 128 bytes, making for one of the
slowest TYPE commands anywhere.

Don't know Godbout's plans, but two pieces of info concerning CP/M-Plus on 
the TRS-80 Model-II, -12, -16.

o Tandy announced it for one-week delivery back in January.  Their best guess
now is maybe the end of April.  Also, it is a minimal implementation.  Leaves
a small TPA, and not all the expanded features which require bank switching
(according to reports, they still haven't shipped my copy).

o Pickles&Trout, one of the two major suppliers of CP/M-2.2 for the above
machines, has announced that they do NOT intend to support CP/M-Plus.  The
reason, they feel that the hardware is not suited to the task and that their
new ACP (a CCP replacement much like ZCPR) will make up the difference.

If I get the time (a very dubious prospect at present) I will take a look
at the schematics and see if it is really all that big a problem to do a
proper CP/M-Plus.  Don't know yet if the Tandy version has enough info left
with it to re-do the job, but I doubt it.

There is usually a 4 byte header at the start of these types
of files, placed there by the modem utility that is used (not FTP),
and so the files have to have those 4 bytes removed. I do this
by loading the file with DDT and moving the file down 4 bytes,
effectively copying over itself. Of course the entire file MUST
fit in ram, so large files are lost to me, the other option is
to be able to use the BILLW MODEM program, which I am told an
can remove the 4 offending bytes. I don't know the reason for the bytes
something to do with ITS, (operating sys??)

same on VMS 3.2 for use with micros and possibly as a part of an

The February Mini-Micro Systems magazine has a lot of info on Winchesters,
including a comparison chart and numerous advertisements.

The previously mentioned Western Dynex 5 Mb removable drive is being shipped
12 weeks after receipt of order, according to their office in Arizona.

Advanced Digital Corp. has what seems to be a good controller for the S-100
bus and ST-506 interface.  It uses the Westrn Digital LSI hard disk controller
chip.  It does not use or require DMA -- it buffers an entire sector and
provides/accepts the data through an I/O port.  Price is $500, including
CP/M driver code in MicroSoft Macro-80 source form.  They are sending me
further technical info, but it sounds like a good one.

Several people said that they had problems using the Morrow Designs board.
One said he uses a Western Digital board, but it requires extra work to
interface to the S-100 bus.

I have the Jade set of boards with the "free" CP/M 3.0 (= CP/M Plus)
on order and should receive it within a week or two.  Right now I have
a CP/M Plus manual set, but it does not have the manual describing the
BDOS/BIOS interface -- it is a user's and programmer's manual.  Still,
I think I understand some of the techniques they are using, and believe
they will be highly effective.  Anyway, if anyone has specific questions,
I will see if I can answer them from the information I have and receive
later.

I have done a little investigation and have found someone who has
plans to implement a full banked CP/M Plus installation on a Godbout.
Time frame is on the order of a month he says, and since it will be
his third implementation, I believe him! I will keep the net informed,
and am fairly certain the BIOS will be placed into the public domain.
I think it will be worthwhile to try to develop a list of Plus
implementations as they appear. I will try to do same, though I do not
expect that I will be posting anything to the list for at least
several weeks.
P&T is all wet if they think a banked Plus system is of minimal
advantage over a 2.2 setup. This of course of course is an opinion
based on a reading of the doc and heresay. I will share more
experiences as I gain them.

I recently saw a part of an Info-cpm message that made mention of an
implementation of MODEM for a VAX/VMS. We would like to implement
same on VMS 3.2 for use with micros and possibly as a part of an
ETHERNET LAN . Can anyone out there point
me towards such an implementation????
Thanks,

I heard a while back of a program that simulates a CP/M system on
a PDP-11 under RSX-11M. We have a PDP 11/t55 with among other things
2 RX01 floppies. Any pointers would be appreciated.

Is the first BIOS vector (the cold boot vector) used once CP/M is
running?  I want to be able to put another vector into that location
after the system has warm booted.  Do any programs use the cold boot
once CP/M is running?

(Yes, I know that if they used it, it would cause the system to
cold boot.  But do any programs purposely cold boot?  Perhaps another
way of phrasing it is why does that vector exist?)

Thanks,

David

Some Bios coldboots patch the coldboot vector to the warmboot address
AFTER the coldboot has taken place.... So this should be acceptable.

I have seen some programs that use the cold-boot vector, but I don't
recall what their names are.  If you want some jump vectors without
adding them at the end of the present jump table, how about PUNCH and
READER?  Some CBIOSs don't implement those at all, just do a RETurn.

   Over the past week I have attempted to download the files on the MIT-MC
CPM directory disks AR61 and AR80-AR83. My success has been mixed. I will
provide a record (below), but 1st let me describe the configurations.

MC to ECLB
   All files were first moved from MC to ECLB under IMAGE.

ECLB
   I have tried to download files, which failed, several times using
various combinations of:
     <WANCHO>  MODEM.EXE.116
     <RIZZI>   MODEM.EXE.31
     <BILLW>   MODEM.EXE.90
              NMODEM.EXE.49
              XMODEM.EXE.1
               MODEM.MAC.115
     <STERNLIGHT>MODEM.EXE.?
(Thanks are extended to each of these programmers for making these files
available)
   Each of these programs run under the TOPS EXE, and may all derive from
a common root program, as it is dificult to tell them apart when running.

TAC
   I must operate through a TAC, upon which I set:
          @p t
          @f i e
          @f o e
and sometimes
          @b i s
          @b o s
which dosen't seem to make any difference.

At HOME
   I have a MAX80 upon which I can run CP/M 2.2 or LDOS5.1.3 and a
300 baud Hayes Smartmodem. To download the files I have tried MODEM72,
SMODEM37, MDM705 and LMODEM (under LDOS - Les Mikesells pgm). I have
used both CHECKSUM and CRC mode - no difference noted.

RESULTS
   In the list below where a file failed to transfer it failed, each
time on the same sector, CONSISTANTLY. All combinations of MODEM 
programes (TOPS and at HOME) produced the exact same result!
   All transfers were S to R (also tried many combinations like
SQ, SQN, SQIN, R, RQ,etc) except one (*).

I have uploaded Dave Hardy's CP/M Plus (aka 3.0) BIOS for the Morrow
DJ2D disk controller to AR18:CPM on MC. This is the first entry in this
arcive, but we expect to be able to expand the available Plus BIOS
implementations in the near future. See Dave's article series in
Microsystems magazine for an excellent treatment of upgrading from
2.2 to 3.0.

I solicit any CP/M Plus software for this archive. Please contact me if
you have any contributions; I am also planning on editing a list of
available implementations both proprietary and in the public domain,
and would appreciate details if you know of such.

I tried to download AR82:CPM;CD and died at block 20,
exactly where LHILL did . I ran Modem705 on Apple
I had f o e and f i e set to delete flow control( I noticed
that that command turns off nulls). I also tried a different
program ASCOM which uses Check character not CRC as modem705 does.
Results exactly the same. I would guess there is some code
sensitivity in net. Any help from the TCP/TAC gurus would be
appreciated. Oh-Modem705 said timeout.
Hope this helps,
Allan
PS Modem705 is really very very nice ....

Dan,

By MODEM do you mean MODEM7 (such as a micro uses to talk to an RCPM
system) or XMODEM (the program at the RCPM which talks to the micro)?  I am
looking for a public domain implementation of XMODEM for a VAX/VMS
11-780, and would appreciate any pointers to same.

Thanks,

I suspect that the problem is that TOPS20 is not properly
doubling the 377 character (the TELNET protocol requires
that or the TAC will eat it) and on that block
the checksum is coming out to 377.

We have code in our monitor to fix this but it may not have migrated
to ISI/ECL yet. I'll make it available to your system people.

We probably shouldn't be bothering the whole info-CPM list
with this discussion.

I have a problem which involves two PC's communicating over a

database.  While communicating each PC will be involved with 
querying and updating the database.  Entries made in one database 
want to be transmitted to the other PC for automatic update of the 
other database; and vice versa.

My questions:

1) Has anyone heard of any similar applications?  Using CPM?

2) It seemed that a multiprocessing CPM might make the application 
easier to create.  Is there a multiprocessing CPM available?

3) Any standard packages that might help?  I have been considering 
using CPM, extracting the Ward Christensen FTP suff from a 
MODEM-like program, and maintaining the database via MBASIC 
or FORTRAN, perhaps using a product like MDBS.  Any suggestions?

4) The PC is up in the air.  Am looking with a portable with some 
track record including a 5-15Mb hard disk.  Any experiences here 
would be appreciated?

Thanks in advance for your response.

Some CBIOSs -do- implement PUNCH and READER, however ... as clock I/O

I am working on VMODEM as time permits these days.  It is an implementation
of UMODEM that is to run under VAX/VMS on our 11/780 at work.  Am writing
it in C using DEC's new C compiler.  Will send it to MC and post a message
when it is done, but don't hold your breath.  Time is not permitting.

PS -- I'm getting around the binary mode conversion problem by using
exec and invoking SET TERM /PASSALL as a subprocess.

I was also very interested in the ALS CP/M Card because I currently have
a Microsoft Softcard for my Apple ][ and have found several deficiencies
relative to my applications.  The most important performance
consideration for me is speed and the Softcard has an effective clock
rate of only 2 Mhz.  Also the Softcard does not include all standard
CP/M utilities such as SYSGEN nor does it include the BIOS source code
although this has been documented in magazines.  As soon as I saw the
ALS ad I called them to confirm the apparent 6 Mhz clock rate.  I asked
to speak to technical support or a product engineer but was told they
were "too busy completing the product design in order that shipments
might begin by the end of March".  The marketing folks informed me that
the Z-80 ran at 6 Mhz without wait states although they didn't seem to
know what wait states were initially.  I was also interested in details
about how bank switching was done ( a feature of CP/M Plus ) such as the
effective clock rate when using the motherboard RAM.  I really needed to
talk to a product engineer for this information and followup questions
but they weren't available.  I next decided to confirm that schematics
were available for the board but I was told that schematics were NOT
included and none would be provided under any circumstances.  I also
asked if BIOS source code was included and again the reply was NO!  Again
this would not be supplied under any circumstances although this policy
was subject to review at some future time I was told.  I immediately
checked the ad for the product and found this claim; "...and full
documentation - for just $399.".   I can find no reasonable
justification for these omissions and I consider them essential portions
of the documentation.  The bad part of all this is that I really want to
buy this product.  (I had even reserved one with my local retailer).  At
this point I not sure what to do next.  If any other potential customers
for this product feel the same about this issue as I do you could help
us all by calling ALS and expressing your opinion.  ALS has a toll-free
number 800-538-8177 outside California that you can use to get
additional information or express your concerns.  Anyone obtaining
additional information about this product could mail it to me or post it
to the net.  I really believe that this product is an excellent value
except for the documentation problem and will be valuable for any Apple
CP/M user.

A little more information -- I was told that the CP/M Card will come
with all documentation and utility programs that one would receive from
Digital Research if you were to purchase CP/M Plus directly from them. I
f this is so it makes this product an even better value.  GSX-80, also
from DR is not yet released but will be shipped to all CP/M Card owners
as soon as its available.  

Finally -- I believe that another 6 Mhz Z-80 card is available but I
recall no mention of CP/M Plus.  The price was somewhere around $600.
The initials of the company were something like PCIP.  Does anyone have
any information about this board?  Also how long will it take Microsoft
to respond with their own product?  Anyone have any insight on this?

Osborne users who are interested in MDM705 (the latest
version of MODEM7) will want to get a copy of MDM705OS.ASM.
If you tried this one before and it didn't work, try again.
This is a fixed version of the Osborne overlay file.
It's available from MIT-MC as AR61:CPM;MDM705 OSASM.
Here's a short note explaining the changes/fixes
to the Osborne overlay:

Folks:
    I currently have a real old DJ controller board and am looking
at replacing it (it's terribly slow as much of the control functions
are done in software).  I've heard good things about the DJ2D, but
I am worried that it too suffers from "software-itis" (using
software where hardware is more appropriate).  Are my fears justified?
What kind of performance does this board provide?  Are there any
restrictions (such as not having any other DMA devices on the bus)?

Thanks.

The .HEX file in AR77: is the result of linking the CC1.REL, CC2.REL,
CC3.REL, CC4.REL, RUNTIME.REL, CALL..REL, and SYSLIB.REL files.  The linking
is done with the L80 linker.  The .REL files are produced from the .MAC
files by usin the M80 macro assembler (both M80 and L80 are from
Microsoft). SysLIB.REL can be found in ar19:cpm;.  Here is a step by step
process in case you prefer:

     First assemble CC1, CC2, CC3, CC4, RUNTIME, and CALL using M80.  Then
link them all together with the L80 command line:
          RUNTIME,CC1,CC2,CC3,CC4,CALL,SYSLIB/S,C.HEX/N/E
This will produce C.HEX..

Re:   Small-C V2 doc??

Yes, the HEX file seems to be the linked version of the sources.  I
was able to generate a new compiler from the sources by assembling
each, then using L80 to link them together.  I believe the cmmand
line I used was
	L80 RUNTIME,CC1,CC2,CC3,CC4,CALL,SYSLIB/S,CC/N/Y/E.

You'll get some undefined globals from this; they are references
in the header (at top of each CCx.MAC) that are externals declared and
never referenced.  They cause no problem, but I edited them out of my
local versions of the CCx.MAC files, just to keep it clean. Note that
these globals are for Hexdrix's SMALL-VM package, which is not used
unless expressly turned on when C is compiled.

As background, the CCx.MAC files are not the source for the compiler,
but rather the output of a version 1 compiler (running on a UNIX
machine).  Hence, to make any substantial changes to the compiler,
you'd need the CCx.C source files.  I haven't actually gotten as far
as recompiling the compiler on itself.		--Ron Fowler

I haven't heard of any problems with DU2 since I corrected that queue
status print bug the other day.  Suggest you check CRCs to see if they
match (the MIT-MC copy versus yours) and, if so, run GENINS on it and
make sure it is properly installed.

convert and debug the thing using the MBASIC that comes with the

the programs from Software Tools by Kernighan and Plauger. I was

Castro Valley, CA. I came across a mention of another implementation
from Carousel MicroTools in El Cerrito, CA.

My questions are: If you have these tools, what kind of experience have
you had with them (good/bad/not worth the money/etc.)? What kind of
experience have you had with the vendors? What are the resources that
you find you need to take advantage of them (disk size, memory size,
Fortran-80 compiler revision, etc.)?

I have read the reviews of the Unicorn Systems tools in InfoWorld, and
Byte, and I have their address. I have NO address for Carousel
MicroTools, and would appreciate one if anyone knows.

I am particular interested in comparing these two vendors in terms of
features, qualitiy of implementation, support, and cost.

Thanks in advance for all your help.

Carousel MicroTools is the new name of Unicorn Systems.  I talked to
them at the West Coast Computer Faire last weekend, and they had a 
large sign in their booth to that effect.

I cannot tell you very much about their packages, since I have not
used them.  They sell two different packages. One is called the
'Carousel Use-a-ToolKit' which contains only .COM files of almost all
of the tools.  The other package, called 'Carousel Build-a-ToolKit'
contains source for all the tools, the Ratfor preprocessor, and a few
associated programs.  The binary license version is 3 diskettes, 61
.COM files.  The source license version is 6 diskettes.  The prices
are $249 and $395 respectively.  The manual is $40.  They currently
support only CP/M-80, but they plan on having CP/M-86 and MSDOS
versions out soon.

Overall, it looked interesting, but I figured it would be a little too
cumbersome to be of much real use, so I didn't buy it.  Their address
is 609 Kearney St. El Cerrito, CA 94530  (415) 528-1300

P.S. I'm amazed! Carousel's flyer was only the fourth one from the 
top in a 3 pound stack of Faire garbage!

Investiagations at CompuPro indicate that CPM+ is SLOWER than
CPM 2.2x, and most of the CP/M + features can be had by doing a
proper bios for 2.2x...  I have not much more info.  My bright
friend is at CompuPro just now, and that's a phone report.  I do
not think I misunderstood..

I recommend S-100 buss equipment.  My own is CompuPro (Godbout)
and I never have problems.  There are color boards for the buss
if you want color, otherwise a terminal works.  I have 8085/8088
dual processor which gives both 8 and 16 bit capability.
Z-100 is pretty good, but it is BIG and no detachable keyboard.
Look at it..

The problem is that they're in a technological fuge just now;
the Faire wasted them, now my crazy friend Tpony is up there.
And they  are moving.  I wanted to read them the copy I was
writing on them in my Faire report and I couldn't get past the
answering service; fortunately somebody in there called me.
	The 68000 is a problem; there are aabout two copies of
CPM-68K in existence that sort of work, and there seem to be
some fatal bugs in the stuff.  Digital keeps recalling and
revising.  It will all be made to work, but some patience is
going to be rquired.
	The problem t here is that there's not really enough
technical staff (they'd hire more if they could find them) and
the place is not well organized; instead, the programmers and
engineers are happy.  As hardware goes that's a great place to
deal with..  For software, I can see you would have trouble
because most of the Godbout people don't, deep down inside,
believe in software.  They don't even use computers in much of
their business application.  This seems crazy, but...
	They got one hell of a hardware outfit, though, and I
always recommend anybody buying their stuff deal with a good
systems consultant;; there's enough slack in the prices that you
can get systems for the advertised price through a systems
consultant and get the consultant free;  or you can buy at
discounts and do your own;  but if you rely on getting the
Godbout people on the phone, you may have leaned on a weak reed.
	I haven't solved the reachability problem except through
one secret technique involving strange golden liquid known as
Grand marnier./....

I wish this hadn't happened; in fact, I wish they'd stop selling
boards before they have software.  The trouble is, Godbout's
people don't BELIEVE in software.  They put out great boards and
hope someone will figure out a way to make use of them in good
systems.  Often people do, but the 68000 hAs been a kind of
disaster, in that the OS's that were to materialize didn't.
	There is an operating system for the 68K board.  It is
in FORTH.  They use it to test the board.  You will not want it.
I could have it and decided against it.
	I hate to say it, but my counsel is PATIENCE.  All will
be well, and reasonably soon.  But soon could be weeks.

I find it very difficult to believe that a properly written banked
CP/M Plus is slower than 2.2, though this migt be the case for
non-banked (minimal) implementation. All of the people I have spoken
to who have diddled with PLUS thus far say it is considerably faster
in disk I/O, directory searches, etc., and it makes emminent sense
that it ought to be. I hope to be able to give a more first-hand
report in the not too distant future. Sounds like sour grapes to me
emanating from Oakland!

Compupro's cpm 2.2 is so slow on floppies driven by the disk 1
board due to some designs compromises that it is not surprising
that plus is even slower on the first try.  It takes some software
smarts to make any bios perform to the limits of the hardware, and
that isn't likely to happen on the first few tries.  Unfortunately
Godbout doesn't keep trying to improve things once they get it to
work.

If there's anyone out there who has contact with the
"Wizzard of OZ" remote CP/M system, I would appreciate it
very much if they were told that their list of RCPMs is
over a year out of date and inaccurately lists my system.
It not only has the wrong (old) phone number, it does not
show that my system is a "ring-back" one and many people are
calling and not getting an answer because of this.

It all depends on the BIOS.  We have 2.2 on 2S2D floppies (1.1
mByte/floppy) that's rather fast, and also has M drive and N
drive.  This is waht is now distributed with the system, I
believe.
	It is certainly true that once Compupro gets the
hardware out the door, they don't worry about the software.  Len
Ott, their softwaerre man, hs planty smarts, but  not much
support.  Of course this makes for some good opportunities,
since the hardware is DAMN good; and some people have done well
writing  optimization software for Compupro systems..

A new version of FILEFIND, now renamed to FILE, is now available on
MIT-MC.  It's in AR22:CPM;FILE 13ASM and AR22:CPM;FILE 13DOC.  Here's
what the latest revisor has to say about it:

---
TOPIC  :  FILE.COM
FROM   :  IRV HOFF
DATE   :  13 FEB 83

NOTE:  ORIGINAL NAME WAS 'FILE'.  RENAMED EARLY 1981 TO 'FILEFIND' BY
       SOMEONE OTHER THAN ORIGINAL AUTHOR.  NOW CORRECTLY NAMED 'FILE'.

SYSOPS:  THIS IS AN IDEAL PGM FOR USE AS  A0>FILE.COM  TO AUGMENT (OR
         REPLACE THINGS LIKE  DIR NAME*.* $U0AD.

     This program finds a requested file on any/all disk drives and any
user area allowed by the system.  Just say:
A>FILE NAME*.*
     and it will find any file commencing with 'NAME' on any disk drive
and any user area.  It doesn't matter what user area or drive you are
in when you start, it commences at A0:  

     This takes the place of things like:  A>DIR NAME*.* $U0AD,  or
A>DIR NAME $AD, etc.  (Those commands normally commence at whatever
drive you are already on.  If starting from D3, you must reset to A0:
before commencing the search or it will skip the A: B: and C: dives com-
pletely.  'FILE' starts at A0: regardless, making it very convenient to
use.)  It is an universal program that adapts equally well to CBBS, RBBS,
DATATECH, OXGATE and other similar RCPM systems.  It is easy to use and
gives all users on all systems a common command.

     (You can also get the entire directory of all drives and all avail-
able user areas by saying:

A>FILE *.*

It is supposed to be ready for sale to the public in June.  I wil
be getting one in about two weeks to do some Beta testing and to
write some software for PMMI.  I'll let you know how it works when
I get it.  It probably won't support 600 baud any more than a
normal Racal-Vadic modem because it is just that - a cooperative
venture between PMMI and Racal-Vadic, with PMMI designing the entire
S-100 interface and Racal-Vadic building their 103/212 programmable
modem on the board.  It is NOT a piggy-back.  It's a fresh design
from PMMI.  PMMI even wrote some new software for the Microprocessor
that's on the board.

This board has many features, including: dial-tone detect, touch-tone
dialing/rotary dialing, redialing of last number, distant end ringing
detect, voice detection (i.e. got a human instead of another modem,
better hang up), busy detect, etc.  Lots of new and interesting
features.  Oh yes, it's possible to count the rings when deciding
whether to answer a call or not.  This means that call-back operation
IS practical with the new PMMI 300/1200 baud modem (the DC Hayes
Smart modem won't do that).

The board meets the full IEEE S-100 specs, including the ability to
operate correctly with systems using 5 mhz clocks (it may actually
work above this, the specs are not final yet).  It looks like a
normal USART-type serial port to the system, making it easy to
program.  It also has maskable interrupt capability.

A fix is supposedly coming in the new model of the disk 1,

I had requested a fix to the files (all the ZCPR2 files)
which have been squished and now cannot be unsqueezed.

It is my understanding that there is something in the ITS
format that prevents a UNIX machine from unsqueezing these
files FTP'ed directly off ITS.

I also understand that there is a filter program out there
to remedy this problem.

Help in this matter is urgently requested.  HELP!!!

Umm, saying that there is something in the ITS format that prevents
files from being unsqueezed by a unix system, once ftp'd off ITS doesnt
saying anything against ITS, its does say something against unix.  if the
brain damage is in unix, dont blame it on its.

I've had lots of problems with "com" binary files on ITS over the years,
and not just from Unix systems -- so don't blame Unix!  The issue is that
ITS stores these files in a sort of "packed" format that is oriented
around its 36 bit words, and includes some other header information
as well.  For example, let's say you have a file that you uploaded
to ITS using the LMODEM "com file" mode.  Now you try to FTP the file
from ITS to a non-ITS system (in binary/image mode).  The file you get
has this packing and strange header information included.  Small wonder
that squeezed files won't unsqueeze!  When instead you download such a file
through LMODEM, ITS performs the conversions and you get a "proper"
binary file again.

Ideally, ITS should have a special FTP mode which would convert
the ITS com file format back to "real" binary on the fly during
transfer.  I suspect that the ITS folks never considered FTP'ing
of com binaries to non-ITS systems to be a "high-demand" type project.

My interest is not which machine has a problem, though you

you have a problem that needs help.

There are two separate issues here.  First is packing 8 bit bytes into PDP-10's
36 bit words.  This is unavoidable, standard, and the ITS ftp server deals with
it just fine.  The problem is getting the unix user end to tell ITS to do it.
SEE BELOW FOR HOW TO DO THIS.

The second problem is the 4-byte header put in the binary CP/M files stored in
the CPM; directory. This has nothing to do with ITS, and was a decision made by
those involved with maintaining this directory and related programs.  There is
no reason on earth for ITS system programs such as FTP to understand the
conventions used by a small segment of the user population (and believe it or
not, providing CP/M software to unix hackers is not MC's rason d'etre).  In any
case, SEE BELOW FOR HOW TO DEAL WITH THIS.

I might suggest that instead of dreaming about what ITS FTP could or could not
be made to do, someone fix umodem to recognize those header bytes (they are
93H,3AH,D8H,00H) and strip them off.  umodem could also use them for their
intended purpose, differentiating between ascii and binary files, so the user
wouldn't have to give a "b" switch (I assume that's what the -sb below does).
The TOPS-20 modem program already does this.

Anyhow, unix people, here are the answers (if unix is so wonderful, how come
everybody has so much trouble figuring this out? (don't bother answering that))

A new version of DICCRE (the dictionary creation program for SPELL) has been

Zolman.

Don't worry about the integrity of dictionaries you have already created!  You
would have noticed had the bug hit you.  DICCRE V1.0 failed to write double
apostrophes to SPELL0.MAC if one was in a word.  Obviously, M80 simply choked

RCPM operators and others occasionally using their systems with
remote console software (like BYE) will want to get the new
XMODEM73.  It has many new features, explained in some detail below.

---
TOPIC:  XMODEM73
FROM :  IRV HOFF W6FFC
DATE :  27 MAR 83

     XMODEM is a program used primarily on remotely operated RCPM systems
that allows program transfer to and/or from remote users.  It can trans-
fer any type of CP/M file including absolute binary files (.OBJ).
     Originally written by Keith Petersen and based at that time on Ward
Christensen's MODEM ver 2.0 it has since undergone extensive revision.
     Nearly every new version has tacked on yet another computer/modem
combination.  It has grown very unwieldy in size and awkward to handle.
     In a major contribution to simplifying the program, Sigi Kluger with
his XMODEM 6.8 stripped out all the various hardware configurations.  He
wound up with a jump table at the beginning that permits use of external
overlay files for a particular computer/modem....  
     The current version is XMODEM 7.3.  The 7.x series has several new
features which give it a tremendous flexibility.  Major recent additions
include:
 
     1) A general purpose menu.  Just type:

	   A0>XMODEM <return> 

	   This menu includes the drive/user area for normal uploading.
	   (The A0> prompt in this and subsequent examples is shown as a
	   typical possibilty of a drive/user area you may be in.)

     2) Ability to send (download to the remote user) member files from
	   a library group (.LBR)  without having to copy the entire li-
	   brary file.  (Use a separate program called LDIR.COM to find
	   the member names of a library group.)
	        
     3) Ability to specify what disk/user area from which to send a pro-
	   gram so the remote user doesn't have to go to that area first:

	   A0>XMODEM S B6:HELLO.DOC

	   (An option limits the maximum user area.)  
 
     4) Programs can be uploaded to a special non-public user area for
	   the exclusive use of the SYSOP.  These can include replacement
	   programs for one already on some public area, experimental
	   programs you wish him to test before making them public, pre-
	   typed notes for his exclusive reading or any program you wish
	   him to see that is not appropriate for public use at that time.

     5) Ability to download from a special area.  This enables the SYSOP
	   to place special programs, pretyped messages, etc. in this
	   area.  He can then leave a private message on his bulletin
	   board to the person for whom the program is intended.  Al-
	   though any user COULD download that program, only the SYSOP
	   and his intended recepient know the its correct name.  This
	   provides excellent security.  The SYSOP can thus make any per-
	   son an instant temporary privileged user.  This gives him a
	   tremendous flexibility he has not previously had.

     6) Spaces can now be used without error.  Example:

	   A0>XMODEM   L   B7:   CATALOG    CAT2.DOC

	   will send a file called CAT2.DOC from the CATALOG.LBR library.
	   NOTE:  The  .LBR extent need not be included.  If not, it is
                  added automatically.		

     At this time there are several external overlays available.  The
list will obviously grow as others add to it:

XM73ACAT   -  for Apple users with the Novation APPLE-CAT modem
XM73MMII   -  for Apple users with the Micromodem II modem
XM73DCXX   -  for Apple users with the D.C. Hayes modem
XM73PMMI   -  for S-100 users with PMMI modem boards
XM73HZ89   -  for Heath/Zenith H8 or H89 users with external modem
XM73INT3   -  for those using the Compupro Interfacer 3/4 modem
XM73EXT    -  for computers with 8251 I/O and external modems

     These contain instructions on how to then use DDT (or SID) to read-
ily adapt the external overlay to the main program.

     These files are available from the MIT-MC CPM; directory.
The names were changed slightly to fit better into the six-character
two-field filename arrangement that ITS uses.

All are in AR63:CPM;

XMACAT 73ASM
XMDCH  73ASM
XMEXT  73ASM
XMHZ89 73ASM
XMINT3 73ASM
XMMMII 73ASM
XMODEM 73ASM
XMODEM 73INF
XMODEM 73MSG
XMPMMI 73ASM

     Users who can download ITS-style "COM" files will find the same
ten files in AR100:W8SDZ; in "squeezed" format to save downloading
time.  This is a temporary ARchive only and will be deleted in a few
days.  As with squeezer convention, the next-to-last character of the
filename is a "Q" instead of its original character.

load to my micro.  I've been quite sucessfull tranfering .hex and .txt
files.  From the ongoing discussion, I think I know why this is but
I'd really like to know how to get around it.

I have ftp'ed a .com and a .hex file of the same program, loaded
the .hex file, and uploaded the (loaded) .com file to compare with
the original ftp'ed .com file.  NO RELATION!  I was hoping that I could
find those four characters that ITS uses as a file identifier (from 
446353300000 octal = 223,072,330,0 as first four bytes)  No luck.

So how do you do it?

Is it possible to generate compatable 8085 code from "C" or LISP-like

Or is there a interpreter for the internally supported primitives
which accepts something other than basic?

The forthcoming 300/1200 baud PMMI S-100 modem will NOT have
the Vadic 3400 protocol included.  Several people asked about
that.  Vadic isn't including it in most of their new OEM units.
There has been some discussion about whether 3400 is better
than 212A, and one comment I read was that it really wasn't a
better protocol.  The only reason it SEEMED better, the sender said,
was that the 212A part of the "Triple Modem" wasn't as well designed
as it could have been.  I assume that if this is true, it could be
the reason that Racal hasn't included the 3400 protocol in the new
units.  They may have improved the 212A part instead, in the interests
of gaining a wider market.  This is all conjecture, however.

June), here's the address and phone number:

I am trying to put together a list of CAD tools that run under CP/M to
aid in circuit design, logic design, PC board layout, etc. Does such a
list exist? If one does not, send me any info you may have and I will
distribute a list of those programs that turn up.

			Thanks,

	Is there a way to get more than 256 (or whatever the Disk
Parameter Header says) files per disk?  Is there any good reason
why I couldn't change my BIOS dph table to be 512 entries?  I have
a few disks that have 100-200k free, but the directory is full.

In the Feb 21 issue of INFOWORLD, page 63, there is an offer
of MODEM7 on a 5-inch disk in SuperBrain format.  Dave
Steidley of Omnitech, 50 Baltusrol Way Short Hills, .J.,
07078 offers the disk for only $7.50 copying charge.  I sent
for one and got it in about 10 days.  It is an older version
of MODEM7 (7.3, I think) but it works fine.  Used that to bring
MODEM705 up on the SuperBrain, saving all the time of bootstrapping
up via MBOOT3.  You don't have to send a disk, it is included
in the $7.50.

On the same page there is a similar offer of MODEM7 for the
Vector Graphic.  Also 85 volumes of CPMUG on Kaypro format
disks.

BRL's ftp doesn't know about BINARY files.  It's a dumb ASCII-only
ftp.  It strips ALL high-order bits from the file.  This has been
brought to the attention of the system gurus at BRL but so far no fix
has been forthcoming.  This was caused by the changeover to TCP/IP,
which required the BRL people to re-write FTP.  They seem to have
little interest in the problems of us CP/M'ers.  (Maybe a little
competativeness showing there?)..
