Subject: Suggestions for Irv Hoff's SD program

TO: Irv Hoff

  I apologize for posting this generally, but I do not have Irv Hoff's
correct network address. Since Irv is still actively developing the SD
program (version 128 is now available), I thought I would send him the
following suggestions.
(1) Support options $1, $2, $3 and $4 which specify the number of
    columns for the listing. I use version 111 of SD which has this
    feature (almost), but it seems to have been dropped from later
    versions.
(2) Support an option to suppress headers and trailers. [Items 1 and 2
    together simplify the post processing of an editable disk copy.]
(3) Support an option which suppresses individual file data, leaving
    only summary information. The summary data could be total number
    of files and their sizes for each user area and for the disk as a
    whole.
(4) Make the default file name and extensions consistent. 'SD' trans-
    lates to 'SD *.*', but (a) 'SD A' is interpreted as 'SD A.<null>'
    (rather than 'SD A.*', and (b) 'SD .B' is interpreted as 'SD <nul>.B'
    (rather than 'SD *.B').
(5) When the screen fills and the user is prompted for MORE, accept
    <space> for a new page and <return> for a single line (a la the
    unix more program).

In the documentation for Z8E, the author describes how to patch it to use
user supplied routines for i/o.  It should be relatively easy to either
use BIOS calls or to perform the i/o yourself (via the Z80 ports), if
you have a BIOS listing.

  I agree! This lack of consinstency - with itself, as well as with most other
directory facilities - is a nuisance. You can specify a null extendion by
specifying 'SD <filename>.' . On the other hand, I can't see a way to specify
a null filename, unless it's 'SD <space>.' ... but then, I've rarely wanted
to, if that proves anything :-)

  I use SD all the time. Just got version 128. It looks good; sorts by
extension/type and size by record are wins to me. One thing I'd like to see is
an indication of how much space each file wastes at the end of the last
allocation group, to decide which files should be placed in libraries. Maybe a
display in fractional groups? 

  If Unix 'compatibility' is worth pursuing (I think it is), then let's return 
to the '-' switch delimiter, rather than the '$'. I'm sure it's easy enough to 
change in the source; maybe it just needs to be documented.

  BTW, does anyone know of a directory utility which will tell you which, if 
any, files have groups multiply allocated? DU will you one of them, but you 
have to delete it to see the others. None of the UNERA-type programs seem to 
check for this properly, and only one bad-block checker (BD) even tells you 
when it does this.

Irv can be found on the CP/M Forum on CompuServe, and on no other
networks that I am aware of.  Perhaps someone will repost your message
to him there.

Subject: BIOS debugging

The way I always did this was to gen the test verision for 32K.  Now Use the 
DDT comand in you 64K version to BOOT the 32k version (This is done by changing
your disk and then using DDT to branch to the BOOT part of your ROM)  It has 
been so long that I can't remember how you arrange to regain control to the DDT
in high memory.  Anyway the DDT in high memory uses the 64K version of the BDOS
to do its I/O, and the CCP, etc that runs in the 32K version is using the 32K 
BDOS.  No problem.    One way to gain control is to Note the address in 
location 38 (the DDT trap address) in the 64k version.  load up DDT on the 32 K
version and change location 38 to point to the 64K value.  Now the next 
Breakpoint will cause control to pass to the DDT in high memory.  Peace

	"The problems it that all of these debuggers appear to use the
	BDOS to do their I/O, and this problem involves BDOS calls to
	the BIOS. Needless to say, this does bad things to the BDOS's
	internal stack ... Another complication is that, in this case,
	the CCP (or it's replacement) must be intact to handle the warm
	boot. I've whipped up a little assembler routine to fudge
	address 0005, etc., to keep the debuggers from overwriting it,
	so at least that's not a problem."

As long as that assembler routine is already there, teach it to
intercept the BDOS call, check to see if it's a terminal I/O request,
and let it through if not; if it is terminal I/O, do it directly (call
the BIOS or write directly to the UART).

Subject: DateStamper

At *LONG* last I finally got around to ordering PluPerfects DateStamper
package.  Overall impression -- Money VERY well spent!  The did a good
job, and for the price, a very good value.

It took some time to go through and verify that none of the addresses
used in the BDOS by DateStamper were in conflict with the numerous
patches I have made myself (I could have used the "non-standard BDOS"
version, but I hate to waste memory).  It would have been nice if they
had provided a list of address they alter.

They reference a number of PD routines they have modified to work with
DateStamper (MCAT, XCAT, APPEND, TOUCH, MAKE, EX14A, etc.) and say they
are "available on various bulletin boards."  Anyone know if any of these
routines ever made it into the SIMTEL20 archives.?  Sure wish I had
source code (sigh!). 

Only a satisfied customer....

What I suggest is that you judicously place some calls to print "progress"
messages in various "suspect" portions of your BIOS, and re-assemble. If you
can use another serial port to dump this info (like a line printer), you might
be able to trace the approxiamte area of the problem.  From there, you might
be able to zero in on it.  Dumping to another serial port makes it easier to
get through a session without wading thru messages within the session.
 
For debugging nasty things like that I like to put tests in like
if "this data item doesn't look normal" then
    print "data item such & such is corrupt" /* hex dump even better... */
in various places in addition to the 
    "print ? BIOS call entered"
    "print ? section x of BIOS call..."
    "print ? BIOS call returning..."
     etc...
messages sprinkled about.

However if this does not help, you'll have to provide more sophisticated
debug traces with print calls etc.  You might want to add a "print_hex_byte"
to your bios to provide another tool to test with.  I see no choice, but to
wade into the code up to your eye balls.

Ever tried to trace a vectored interupt for serial i/o using Zilogs SIO
chips?  Turned out to be hardware after 3 months of pulling my hair out;
The serial i/o chips just needed a 150 ohm resister tied to +5 V on the 
system clock pin!  Without that, they worked most of the time, but not
all of the time!  Had to resort to similar methods to the above, the exception
being that I could not just dump serial data any time I wished (within the
interrupt routine).

	In a recent Byte, Steve Ciarcia refered to "the Hitachi HD64180
(Z180)".  Does this mean that Zilog is now a second source of the HD64180?
Or is the Z180 not exactly the same as a HD64180?

	By the way, I got the first issue of Ciarcia's new magazine,
Circuit Cellar Ink, yesterday, and it looks good.  Just the thing for
anyone who likes his Byte column and wants more.

Thanks for the kind words about DateStamper, Margaret.

DateStamper's several internal patches into the standard DRI CP/M 2.2
BDOS require that the BDOS file functions operate exactly as in DRI's
released version, and be located exactly at those addresses.
DateStamper also patches the BDOS exit routine.  The exact patches
have evolved through several versions, and it wasn't possible to
get them into the printed manual.

The "long" or "non-standard BDOS" version of DateStamper patches only
the entry to the BDOS.  It has proved compatible with quite a variety
of CP/M 2 emulators  -- ZRDOS, P2DOS, Z80DOS, Apple, ...-- but
requires about another 0.25K.

An increasing number of public-domain utilities are supporting
DateStamping, particularly for file copying, directory listing, and
disk cataloging.  The ones you list are available on the DateStamper
Toolkit disk from Plu*Perfect Systems.  More recent ones include:

  CR23D and UNCR23D -- crunch/uncrunch
  PPIP -- file copy
  SAVSTAMP -- save create datestamp when editing,...
  ZFILER -- file utility

Jay Sage's RCPM (617-965-7259) has a number of these.

EX14a fixes EX14 (in-memory batch command processor), which wouldn't
run with any sort of RSX.

As a side note, DosDisk, which has just started shipping, provides
datestamping for files on MS-DOS disks when run on a
DateStamper-equipped system.  The distribution disk includes upgraded
directory (SDD) and file maintenance (DATSWEEP) utilities that
display/use/manipulate the MS-DOS datestamps.

Finally, you'd asked earlier about QP/M.  It's a (Z80) CP/M 2.2 BDOS
emulator by MicroCODE Consulting that has been used principally, I
believe, on Kaypros and Zerox 820-I upgrades.

I have just received the ConIX operating system for my Bondwell 2

the diskette format for my computer, so I got KAYPRO DSDD 5 1/4 inch

my IBM-PC to read this format. (It kan read Kaypro 2, 2X, 4, 10 formats.)
But it didnt work. I get a disk error message all the time. I have

>Thanks for the kind words about DateStamper, Margaret.

I've been using DateStamper since October; I used it with WordStar 4.0,
Eco-C80, and the Make utility supplied in the tool kit to develop a
~3500 compiler for a course in compilers and operating systems that
I took.  DateStamper made keeping the numerous source files up-to-date
easy.  DatSweep made incremental backups possible (I use a 1M Advent
RAM Disk; it sure beats copying ALL the sources just to make sure that
everything is safely on a floppy).

I've been using DosDisk since December (it came with my upgrade for the
MultiCopy program for CP/M Kaypros).  I take disks back-and-forth from
work regularly, and I have only had a problem with one disk: a demo-disk
for CompuView's VEDIT PLUS.  None of our machines at work could read it,
either.  I was able to access it with Media Master on my Kaypro.

I've also been using the public domain demo for BackGrounder II.  Did you
know that there is a way to log to another disk while running BGII?  It
involves DatSweep (doesn't work with NewSweep, so it must be something
peculiar to DatSweep).  Maybe if I get a full-time job, I'll spring for
the complete version.

I need some assistance from a Kermit expert in getting a properly assembled

to reassemble the machine dependent code to come up with a working Kermit.

I find that if I try to download a file in excess of 116 packets, the Kermit
cannot swallow the code at the same time it is writting to the disk.  The 
error displayed on the screen is:

I am using version 4.05 of Kermit, and have C-Kermit in our base VAX down-

Any assistance would be greatly appreciated.

Subject: DosDisk kit version

The "kit version" of DosDisk requires writing and assembling an
overlay for interface to the user's bios.  The bios must have
table-driven logical and physical disk format parameters, so that the
overlay can, when DosDisk is loaded, set or install the MS-DOS format
parameters IN THE BIOS.  (Later when DosDisk is unloaded, the a
different entry point in the overlay must restore the default format).

More simply put, you have to be able to set the bios, somehow,
so bios-read and  bios-write calls will function correctly after
valid track and sector calls have been made.  "Old-style" bioses, with
disk parameters hard-wired into the assembly code, don't normally
support MS-DOS format; "modern" bioses provide some type of
table-lookup for the parameters, and a method of altering or
selecting the table values.

The kit version is not recommend unless you have advanced Z80 assembly
language experience and technical knowledge of your bios.  The
appendix of the user's manual lists the overlay specifications, and
the kit includes a sample overlay.

BTW, DateStamper is NOT REQUIRED for DosDisk, although they work in
tandem very nicely.

Bridger mentioned a utility modified for use with DateStamper.  The
particular program was called PPIP, which I assume is a PIP replacement
which doesn't necessarily alter all the dates when a file is copied.
My impression from him is that this is a PD program.

I haven't been able to find it around.  Jay Sage's BBS (and thanks
for the pointer, Bridger) had many of the others, but I couldn't
find PPIP.  I also do not believe it is on the Plu*Perfect tool

I have heard:
1: The above is a problem only in 8-bit bus mode.  (I use 16-bit)
2: The latest mask revision (due out any day now) has fixed this.

Would it make sense to start a Z-280 mailing list?  I have no

The old ARCHIVE patch (aka ARCHIVE.ASM) had a bug which caused
copies to diskettes with 'removeable media' checking to report
BDOS DISK R/O errors.  Isaac Salzman came out with a one-byte
simple patch to fix the problem.  Unfortunately, it was TO
simple.  It disabled completely the disk-change checking in the
BDOS.

Did anyone ever come up with a better fix for this problem?
(Apparently clearing the archive bit was NOT updating the
directory checksum used by the disk-change check routine.)
I tried substituting the similar patch out of BBACK622.LBR
(called ARCH.ASM), but it seems to have a different problem.

1. Create a file FOO.BAR
2. Set the ARCHIVE bit
3. Edit FOO.BAR 
4. Examine the directory.
   The *new* file FOO.BAR has the
   ARCHIVE bit set, but the old file
   location (now FOO.BAK) has been 
   cleared.

Any suggestions (before I start disassembling more of BDOS)?

Subject: Source for PPIP with DateStamping Support

   PPIP certainly was and should still be on my Z-Node (I wrote the version
with DateStamper support, version 1.5 if I remember correctly -- beware of
later versions; several seriously defective ones were released).
 
   Whenever you are looking for a file on a remote system, you should use a
command provided for that purpose.  The command generally has one of the
following names: FF, FIND, FILE, FINDF, FINDFILE, FILEFIND, WHEREIS, WIS. 
On my system, all of these and then some are available.
 
   If the command is FIND, for example, you would enter the command as FIND
PPIP*.*.  You should always use a wild expression (maybe even just PP*.*,
and PIP*.* in addition) in case the file name is not exactly what you expect
(such as in a library or squeeze or crunched or with a version number).  On
my system, the commands automatically make the file spec wild, and you can
list several file specs for a single search.  Thus on my Z-Node you could
enter:
 
          FF PPIP,PIP
 
This is equivalent to FF PPIP*.* and FF PIP*.* together.

Try setting setting Kermit's buffer size down to 8 or 4 K.  CP/M Kaypros have
very slow disk i/o, particularly writes.  It actually writes each physical
(512 byte) sector 4 times!  The ROM enhancements (e.g. Advent TurboROM)
eliminate this.  The TurboROM actually provides 4 times faster writes and
2 times faster reads.

Here is the official bug sheet, as I received it from ZILOG:

============

Subject: Z280 Errata                       Dated: 06/05/87 at 1522.

This document is a list of known bugs on the Z280 silicon,
Revision G.

1.	POSSIBLE CACHE CORRUPTION.
This bug happens only when the Z280 is used in the Z80 bus
mode. It can be attributed to the fact that the Z280 is
designed as a 16-bit device with internal logic geared
towards the transfer of words instead of bytes.

In the Z80 bus mode with the cache enabled, a memory read of
word quantity data (not instructions) causes the cache to be
updated inadvertently. This happens only if the word data
address is even aligned. This is best explained in the
following example:

The stack pointer (xSP) is pointing to location 1004H. The
contents of external memory (not cache) locations 1004H and
1005H are "BB" and "CC" respectively. When a "POP HL"
instruction is executed, the problem will exhibit itself.

For correct operation, the following events should occur:
	a.	Memory Read Transaction with address "001004"
		valid at time of address strobe (AS). When read
		(RD) is asserted, the data bus should contain
		"BB." Cache location "001004" should be updated to
		"BB" and validated. Register L should now contain
		"BB" as well.
	b.	Memory Read Transaction with address "001005"
		valid at time of address strobe (AS). When read
		(RD) is asserted, the data bus should contain
		"CC." Cache location "001005" should be updated to
		"CC" and validated. Register H should now contain
		"CC" as well.

Due to the errata, the following takes place instead:
	a.	Memory Read Transaction with address "001004"
		valid at time of address strobe (AS). When read
		(RD) is asserted, the data bus contains "BB."
		Cache location "001004" inadvertently gets updated
		to "10" (contents of A15-A8) instead of "BB."
		Cache location "001005" gets updated to "BB"

	b.	No second Memory Read Transaction takes place

This anomaly can be negated through any of the
following methods:
	a.	Use Z-Bus mode instead of Z80.
	b.	Ensure that word data is odd-aligned. This will

	c.	Ensure that no code resides in the same 16-byte

		cannot be the same).
	d.	Disable cache.


2.	BURST MODE MEMORY TRANSACTIONS.
It has been discovered that the burst memory cycle does not
function as described when in the X2 and X4 bus clock modes.
It does function as specified in the X1 bus clock mode. What
happens is that the IE signal behaves as if it were a normal
memory access cycle.

This should not impact many applications because the burst
mode is used for high performance, and the highest
performance should be observed with the X1 bus clock mode.

There is one that advertises in Profiles.  Its called Federal Income Tax

1040, 1040A, and "other frequently used IRS forms".  The price is $59.95 +
$5.00 S&H.  There is also a TaxPreparers version (presumably for people
who do this sort of thing for a living) for $30 more.  The company's name,

The CP/M programs UNARC.COM (for Z80 systems) or UNARCA.COM (for 8080/8085)
will do this for you.  Latest versions (1.6) are contained in the self-
unpacking archive file, UNARC16.ARK.  This is available in the SIMTEL20

file, rename to UNARC16.COM, and run it to extract the UNARC utility and

Subject: Warning About PPIP17

   I saw the note from Keith about PPIP17 being available from
SIMTEL20 and would like to offer a warning.  That version of PPIP is
seriously flawed.  I used to have it on my Z Node, but many users
complained that it did not work.  When I tried it, I experienced
serious problems as well.  There would appear to be either a problem
with the stack, careless use of page 0, or overflow of data onto code. 
The problems do not appear on all systems or at all times.  They
appear to be data dependent.
 
   These problems are unfortunate.  The author of PPIP16 and PPIP17
added a desirable option, 'M' for 'move', to delete the source file
after a successful copy.  Perhaps an enterprising programmer will
extract the code for this option and put it into PPIP15, which does
work.
 
   Another feature that I have wanted to have in PPIP is a default to
ignore SYS-type files and an option ('S') to include them.  I use
DateStamper, and PPIP always wants to copy the R/O-SYS file
!!!TIME&.DAT file when I give a *.* file spec in user 0.  It should be
fairly straightforward to add such a feature.

Subject: CBM <---> CP/M

I have a Commodore-128, a 1571 and a 1541 disk drive.  I would
really like to start using my C128's CP/M mode, but I can't copy
any files to my CP/M disks.  My vt100 emulator and my kermit
programs will download any file to C128 mode, but I have nothing
to move software to CP/M.

Does anybody have a program to move software from C128 to CP/M?
The program MUST run in C128 mode, of course, since if it ran only
in CP/M mode, I wouldn't be able to run it!  I tried downloading
from RPICICGE the file PD:<CPM.C128>64CONVRT, but 64convrt doesn't
read the CP/M directory correctly.

Please, I'd like to get started with CP/M.  There's a lot I can do
once I get just a few programs across!

When I made the PD1:<CPM.FILEDOCS>SIMCPM.IDX database and announced
it to Info-Cpm I thought I had included a comment that it was not
complete.  Many of the older files are not included.  There were just
too many old ones for me to describe in the time that was available.
I didn't want to include files with no description but if you think I
should I can change the database.  Perhaps a better approach would be
to create a second database of undescribed files with a blank
description field until I have time to do them or someone else has the
time.

You don't have to revert to the CRCLST.  See PD1:<CPM>FILES.IDX which
is updated daily (sometimes several times per day when a lot of new
files are added) containing a complete listing of all files.  It's a
comma-delimited file in the same format as SIMCPM.IDX but with a blank
description field on each line.  This file is a handy way to see
"what's new" on SIMTEL20 if you don't want to wait for my monthly
upload report.

Well, if you are working with a Unix system or one of its clones or licencees
you use a program called ``arc'', (who would have thought of it :-) ).
Heck, I only found out last week.

I can probably find the source around here if I look hard but you should look
there first.  Did arc come off the net originally?

DosDisk is written in z80 assembly language and licensed by
Plu*Perfect Systems in binary form.  In principle, a port to 68000
assembler should be possible if the 68k system supports

From: "John S. Fisher"  <FISHER@CICGE.RPI.EDU>
Subject: Bitnet server overloaded

As many of you on the Bitnet-side of this list realize there have been
some difficulties getting files from the Bitnet file server at RPICICGE.
Three independent but simultaneous events seem to have caused serious
network congestion through the main cooridor of Bitnet.  The particular
events are not important except for the fact the RPICICGE server was one
source for the over-run of network data.

Since I cannot allow my server to be an unfair burden to the network I
have placed it into restricted service:  File requests were limited to
one per day, and directory listings were usually disabled.  Februrary
has just not been a good month.

Some analysis of the types of requests flowing into the server indicated
that most of the load was coming from people requesting directory listings
at regular intervals (probably just to see what was new).  I cannot really
blame people for their actions, the server gave them no good alternative.

At any rate, in an attempt to keep the server within acceptable traffic
loads, I have made a couple of changes to how it operates:

1.) The /PDDIR command is be reworked.  If just a directory name is
    specified (as in /PDDIR PD:<CPM>) the server will return a list
    of the subdirectory names.  Formally, it returned a complete listing
    of all files available from the server.

2.) If /PDDIR is used with more than just a directory name specified,
    it expects a new parameter, a number following the name pattern.  The
    number specifies a limit on age for entries to be listed.  If the
    number is omitted, the default is 30 meaning list no file older than
    30 days.  For example, /PDDIR PD:<CPM.*>*.* 14 would search for any
    files in the CPM directory that have been add/updated in the last two
    weeks (but see #3, next).

3.) If /PDDIR is used with an asterisk appearing in the subdirectory name
    (as in /PDDIR PD:<CPM.*>*.* and /PDDIR PD:<CPM.SYS*TL>*.*) then the
    search is unconditionally cut-off after 21 entries are found.  That
    means that /PDDIR PD:<CPM.SYSUTL>*.* 99999 would list all entries in
    the SYSUTL subdirectory, but /PDDIR PD:<CPM.SYS*TL>*.* 9999 would list
    only the first 21 entries.

4.) Both /PDGET and /PDDIR keep track of the number of requests and the
    number of bytes the command generates.  (Formally, only the /PDGET
    command keep counters, and the counters were for number of files.)
    Requests are denied with the counters reach 5 requests or 100,000
    bytes, which ever comes first, in one day.  (However, the first file
    requested during any day may exceed 100,000 bytes.)  Counters are
    also kept by network node to prevent people from defeating the
    command limits by "cycling-through" userids.

5.) The server keeps a local cache of recently requested files.  In many
    cases a file at Simtel20 would be updated, but the server on Bitnet
    would still have a cached copy of the old version.  The server now
    tries to compare date-of-last-change to determine if the cached copy
    is the most current.  Obsolete copies are discarded and the newest
    version fetched in its place.

To make matters worse, complete testing of these changes has been frustrated
by some local problems that have prevented reliable access to the Internet.
The server is presently sitting with a two-day backlog of requests.  But, be
that as it may, most of the changes are long overdue.  The limit parameters
in place are best-guesses by me and are subject to change.

Subject: WXTERM (Windowed Xmodem Terminal) source code needed

WXTERM is a terminal/file transfer program for MSDOS that does
Windowed Xmodem and Xmodem protocols.  The WXTERM.ARC as distributed
did not include source code.  I believe this is written in Turbo
Pascal and originates with some folks associated with the "PLINK"
(People Link) service.  It is public domain and distribution is
encouraged because they want to see more people using the WXmodem
protocol.

On CP/M computers we have no implimentation of ZMODEM (which I
consider to be a better protocol for the new high-speed modems and
packetized networks).  I had hoped that someone would write a Zmodem
program but none seems forthcoming.  The protocol seems too complex to
try to write an assembly-language version for CP/M.  Compiled "C"
versions are too big to fit in most people's transcient program space.

The only alternative seems to be to go to WXmodem.  Does anyone have
the latest Turbo Pascal source for it?  I'd like to try to convert it
to run on CP/M.

I would suggest using SEAlink over WXMODEM, as it is supported over a
much larger base.  SEALink is built into the Opus bulletin board
system, and is present in MANY of the newer terminal programs.  It is
fully compatible with Xmodem, and uses a 6-block window for greater
efficiency over packet-switched networks and the like.  It is also
VERY easy to implement.  I'll see if I can dig up the sample source
code for it; if you have a local Opus bulletin board, see if they have
the BinkleyTerm program available; in the source for Binkley are
routines for Zmodem, Xmodem, Ymodem, and SEAlink.

Subject: DosDisk for CP/M-68K (ref: RSX modules)

With reference to Bridger Mitchell's comments about porting DosDisk
to CP/M-68K (Z-80 assembly language running as RSX routine):

CP/M-68K does indeed support RSX modules (I have written a number of
them), although the total DRI documentation on them in the 68K manual
consists of the statement that they are supported.

I should point out however that porting a Z80 assembly language
program to the 68000 is non-trivial.  Better off to look at the
Z80 code and use that as a template to re-write the program.  The
biggest problem is that the Z80 (and 8080) does not update the CC
for a number of common instructions.  A straight transliterated
version will spend a lot of time saving and restoring
(uselessly) the CC.  Only other solution is to look at every
conditional and see where the CC was actually determined.

- e.g. HAAR@GMR.COM - that is understood by CSNET, ARPANET, and
many others. The file server at RPICICGE is on BITNET and is
unable to send mail to this address. It seems to need the
suffix @RELAY.CS.NET.

Unfortunately, I cannot give this as my return address in
a file request because our mailer generates the return address
automatically. Our systems people tell me that they cannot
modify the CSNET mailer and that the domain-style address
should be understood by any BITNET site that has up to date
software and address tables. Yet this is clearly not the
case at RPICICGE.

Any suggestions other than to give up?

Is there another source for public domain CP/M software
on the net? I cannot get to SIMTEL20 any more because
we are not on ARPANET. I have often used the Royal Oak
RCPM (which has been very helpful in the past) because
they are undergoing an operating system change from CP/M
to TurboDOS and are not yet fully operational.

I shouldn't be surprised by this kind of problem as I use
three different, incompatible mail systems at work. But it
is frustrating to see soemthing useful that you can't quite
get to.

	The 64CONVRT program will work correctly, but the CP/M
	disk that is to be used must be formatted as a 64 SINGLE
	SIDED disk.
	Here is what I did to get a working copy of a terminal 
	program under CP/M (IMP.COM):
	I first downloaded a copy of IMP.COM from a local BBS.
	Next I downloaded a copy of the 64CONVRT program.
	Boot up CP/M and type FORMAT to format a new CP/M disk.
	Select 64 SINGLE SIDED. The convert program will only
	read/write to this format. Run the convert program
	and transfer the terminal program to the new CP/M disk.
	Once you have the program on a CP/M disk you can then
	transfer it over to a double sided c128 CP/M format.
	Once you get IMP up and running, you can download CP/M
	programs directly to a CP/M formatted disk.

You have two choices that I know of:  Big Blue CP/M Reader, which will 
convert files between CBM-CP/M-IBM.  Also the public domain, X-LINK 2.1.
The only diference that I know of between the two is that Big Blue will
format disks, whereas the PD one must have the disks already formatted.

I've been using X-LINK2.1A for some time for IBM/CBM transfers, and
it works quite easily, being menu driven, and fast. The CP/M conversion
part should work equally as fast and easily.

Happy CP/Ming.

I recently obtained Atari's CP/M emulator for the Atari ST.  It seems to work
reasonably well.  But I do need some software including a Z80 assembler, a
C compiler, and a good text editor.  I'm willing to pay (but how would I get it
on Atari's ST CP/M format disks?) but public domain stuff would be fine.  Are
there any BBS's in the US (preferably in Calif/SF Bay Area) that have such
software?  If I have to pay, what would be a good fast assembler, not to

help that you can provide would be great.

I  have  my  Concurrent  CP/M-86  up  and  running on a Commodore

Unfortunately, I did not receive a HEXCOM pgm  with  the  utility

I do have a term called Move-It which will allow  me  to  capture

only download ascii files.

Now to the real problem.  Can anyone tell me how to  convert  HEX
files  to  binary files without HEXCOM?  I think DDT should work,
but I didn't get any literature with  the  disk.   (The  joys  of
owning  an  unsupported  machine)  I  have tried the standard DDT

so  I  have  been  downloading ASM and HEX files.  I would really
like to try some of the very good utilities that are available.

Hello -

     I've been "gifted" with a TM-703C.

     On applying +12 and +5, the motor refuses to spin up even though
the brake solenoid pulls in.  On placing a pencil against the rotor, I

blown.

     Before I think too much about sending it out for repair, I'd like

Number of heads, number of cylinders, reduced-write-current point,

Subject: PCPI Applicard vs. Enhanced Apple //e

The PCPI Applicard's driver set includes one called FAST2E80, which was
intended to provide much-improved screen handling on an Apple //e.  

FAST2E80 does not handle an Enhanced //e properly, because it invokes the
"alternate" inverse uppercase character set that was replaced by MouseText
in the Enhanced //e.  Vanilla programs are fine, but WordStar (for example)
displays the famous "MouseText garbage" for inverse uppercase.

The Enhanced //e has faster screen handling than the original version; in
fact, it's faster than FAST2E80 gives.  So I should just be able to gen a
driver set without this driver, right?  Wrong.  Most vanilla CP/M stuff
seems to run all right without FAST2E80, but WordStar doesn't - every time
I strike the DELETE key, everything below the cursor moves *down* a line. 
That means that WordStar can't be run on an Applicard system in an Enhanced
//e.  Argh!

Does anyone know of a patch to FAST2E80 to make it select the *right*
inverse uppercase character set?  Or is there something in the setup
options for installing the driver?

I have used "HEXIFY"but it seems to place the wrong characters in the first two positions after the colon, and the line is 71 characters long.  When I use asm86 and assemble a86 files, I generate hex files with a 1O after the colon, and lines that are only 65 characters long.  Any ideas?  Sorry if these seem like "dumb" questions, but not much information available for this 
machine,  we  are  writing  the  manuals andgathering most of the

Subject: CP/M-86

John,

The number, in hex, after the colon, is the number of data bytes to
follow after the PC (two hex bytes, low hex byte first) and a 00h.
Thus, if the number after the colon is 10h (16d), the line length, in
characters, would be:

colon		 1
count		 2
address of PC	 4
type (0 = bin)	 2
data in hex	32
checksum	 2
		--
		43

or, an overhead of 11 characters.  Thus, if the line is 71 characters
long, the two characters after the colon would be 1Eh.  If it were 65
characters long, the two characters would be 16h.

In any event, DDT and LOAD both know how to handle counts other than
10h.  All HEXIFY is trying to do is reduce the number of lines
requiring that 11 character overhead by packing more data per line,
all of which is perfectly legal in the Intel HEX format.

I've never heard of a Z180!? But there is an Z280
made by Zilog. It's just wonderful, it's a virtual memory
16-bit Z80 (extended instr. set) with MMU, instr. pipeline
and data/instr. cache. AND lots more.
It currently runs under a 10MHz clock (Xtal = 20MHz) but future
versions will be as fast as 25MHz. The 10MHz version is approx.
3 times faster than a 5 MHz Z80.

Running minix on this chip would be very nice!

ARC for 4.2 BSD and System V is available via anonymous ftp from simtel20.arpa.
They are in the directory "pd2:<unix.arc-lbr>".  This is a version of SEA ARC,
so it doesn't support one of the file compression algorithms used by PKARC.  I
believe that PKARC has an option to force compatibilty with earlier ARC
programs.  This same directory has LAR, an LU clone for UNIX.

Subject: Z-80 assembly UUDECODE is available

Many moons ago, back in June sometime, I wrote a Z-80 assembly
version of UUDECODE, and have been trying to get it to SIMTEL20
since then, but I seem to be having trouble getting mail to Kieth
Petersen, so I thought I'd give one more shot at posting it to
the entire net.
 
Send me mail if you would like an encoded (HEX or UU) copy of
the executable by return mail, and send me an 8 inch disk and
return postage if you want the whole library with sources and
such.  The code was written with the SLR tools, so if your
favorite assembler can't handle 16 character names and such you
may need to hack the sources.
 
The program runs 7 times as fast as the PASCAL version on my
S-100 machine, but I have a hard disk cache so I wrote the disk
I/O routines simply, and the program only runs at 50 percent
of the speed of the PASCAL program on my floppies.  I would
guesstimate that the program will run about 10 times the speed
of the PASCAL version on a RAM disk, though I haven't tried it.
Your milage may vary.
 
I know there was some interest in this back in June, but I
haven't been able to get anyone's attention, so I thought
I'd post one final notice to the entire net.  If there's any
interest, I can Email the binary or Snailmail the sources on
an 8 inch 3740 disk (TPTB will have my head if I start mailing
multiple copies of the source libary through our gateway....)

Question:
>Or is the Z180 not exactly the same as a HD64180?

Answer: the latest Zilog magazine "The last word":

Part-Number   Z80180
Device Name   Z180 8-bit MPU
Description   1MByte Adressing, 2xUARTS, 2xCTC, 2xDMA, Z80 compatible
Speed         8, 10 MHz

Now, the Zilog "Components Literature Order Form":
Part-Number   03-8272-01
Description   Z180/Z64180 Technical Manual
Unit Cost     $12.00

Its amazing how interchangably they use the part number: is it actually
a Z180, a Z80180, or a Z64180 ??? But it is obviously a second source for
the Hitachi CPU.

By the way, in the same naming convention the "interesting" ( <--- my personal
judgement) CPU is called Z280 or Z80280.

By the way, i found Zilog's customer support to be INCREDIBLY BAD ! Obviously
they are not interested in selling their chips (at least to University types
and research projects), because their main market is the military. They are
unpolite, not helpfull, never call back, promise to send literature and samples
and fail to do so, and so son. It was also quite difficult to get "new and hot"
parts from ditributors, which is probably again due to their market
orientation.

Subject: Hexify

Frank,

My machine does not conform to thestandard HEX convention.

Here is a sample of a line that I got when I used "ASM86"
to generate a hexfile.

:1B000081BA0001B109E8CB04A080003C007503E9D103BB5B00BA5C05B921009C
       ^^

Notice the 81!.  That appears for about 1/2 of the pgm, until I 
get a "short" line, then the 81 changes to an 82?

Also note that the two "numbers" after the "1B are "00" not "01"
that "Hexify" produces.

Are these possibly CP/M-86 anomalies?

I have not had any luckfinding any CP/M-86 books, do you have any
possible titles or authors.

Most, in fact all the "utilities" that I have found an A86 (ASM)
file for, run on my machie.  I have to ssume that all others will
too once I figure this problem out.

I just have to figure out how to convrt 8 bit files to 7 bit files
for download.

I am sending a CC to INFO-CPM, maybe I can get some assistance
theretoo.

Any help would be greatly (GREATLY) appreciated, I am doing this
not only for me but about 1000 other Commodore CBM B-128/256 
users in my Club.

Thanks AGAIN in advance.

Subject: P2DOS23 - CP/M BDOS replacement now available from SIMTEL20

Now available via standard anonymous FTP from SIMTEL20...

Filename			Type	 Bytes	 CRC

Directory PD1:<CPM.BDOS>
P2DOS23.LBR.1			BINARY	 63616  2AD1H

In SUPRBDOS Benjamin Ho modified P2DOS to eliminate the need for most
ctl-C's, but in doing so, he made the new BDOS disk error routine
tables incompatible with both CP/M 2.2 and P2DOS.  This incompati-
bility was completely unnecessary.  He also renamed the BDOS
replacement which doesn't make sense either.

I have modified his SUPRBDOS to re-establish full compatibility yet
retain his improvements. I have also added some assembly-time
options. You will find below an excerpt from the assembly listing
describing more fully these changes.

This library (crunched wtih CRUNCH24 and created with NULU) replaces
P2DOS21.ARK, SUPRBDOS.ARK, and SUPRBDOS.BWR, all under PD1:<CPM.BDOS>.

;*
;*   Name returned to P2DOS.
;*
;*   Restored full compatibility with P2DOS mod 2.1 and Digital Research
;*   BDOS. Moved disk error routines and path location address back to
;*   where they were in P2DOS. Fixed Drive Reset Command 37 so only drives
;*   specified in reset vector are affected.
;*
;*   Made system file r/o an assembly time option to satisfy Benjamin Ho's
;*   desire to not protect system files yet allow those of us who want
;*   insurance to take insurance.
;*
;*   Added single character ignore read/only status. It seemed just too
;*   dangerous to allow any character except ^C to cancel r/o status.
;*   This is an assembly time option, so those who wish to retain the
;*   any character cancels r/o status may. The ignore r/o status
;*   character was chosen to be ^X (CANCEL), but may be set to anything
;*   by changing the IGNORE equate.
;*
;*   Added flag to the FLAGS byte to disable ignore r/o status so a
;*   running program can insist that the r/o status of a file or disk
;*   be observed.
;*
;*   Added an assembly time option to allow true XON (^Q) - XOFF (^S)
;*   start/stop of console output. If this option is selected, only
;*   a ^Q will restart suspended console output. Also added is an assembly
;*   time option so suspended console output cannot be restarted by

;*                 Evanston, IL 60201
;*  Background:
;* 
;*  P2DOS MOD 2.1 was not a major improvement on the standard CP/M BDOS.
;*  While it added Public files, slightly more informative error messages, and
;*  time stamp support, it did not fix the major annoyances of the CP/M BDOS,
;*  namely the necessity of logging in new disks with Control-C, mystifying
;*  error messages, and a delete key that looked like it didn't delete.  
;*
;*  P2DOS MOD 2.2 is a major enhancement which liberates the CP/M user from all
;*  these annoyances.  It is compatible with all CP/M software except those
;*  that modify the BDOS.  Fortunately, that type of program is extremely rare.
;*
;*  P2DOS MOD 2.2 may be used with ZCPR3 to provide an extremely powerful
;*  100% CP/M 2.2 compatible operating system.  The resulting system is not
;*  subject to Digital Research's licensing agreement.  The only restriction
;*  is that it may be used for non-commerical use only, as stated by the
;*  authors of ZCPR3 and P2DOS.
;*
;*  Enjoy!
;*  9/2/86- 
;*	    Added automatic login of changed disks--no more Control-C 
;*	      when changing disks!  
;*	    Removed P2DOS tie to ZCPR2.  Can now be used with ZCPR3 or 
;*            (ugh!) normal CP/M.  
;*	    Improved error messages:  
;*	      Disk Error on X: Read Error 
;*                             Write Error 
;*	                       Non-existent drive 
;*                             File is Read-Only 
;*	    Fixed delete key--now works like backspace.  No echoing characters 
;*	    Allowed functions 13 and 37 to recognize changes between single and 
;*            double sided disks on machines which normally require a warm 
;*            boot when "sidedness" is changed.  Bios modification is needed 
;*            to support this feature 
;*	    Fixed directory read bug.  Function 37 bug which plagued
;*            library utility program NULU 1.5 is fixed.
;*	    Choice of assembly by M80 and compatibles or public domain ZASM 
;*          System files are read/write, as in CP/M.  Changed from P2DOS 
;*           mod 2.1 in which system files were R/O
;*          Deleted P2DOS search path so the more flexible 
;*           ZCR3 search path could be used
;*          File split into 3 sections for easy of editing.

Subject: VT52 Emulator Problem

Hello CPM list -
  I have a problem that can't really be answered with a simple yes or no.
  Recently,  LISTSERV@RPICICGE.BITNET started carrying CPM files from SIMTEL20.
I have a Kaypro 2X,  work on a VAX cluster running VMS,  am on BITNET myself,
and with great joy noticed a VT52 emulator.  Got it,  and it didn't work.  Ok.
  The file was <CPM.KAYPRO>KP-VT52.LBR.  I ordered it mailed,  uuencoded.
Used a CPM version of Kermit to download it to my Kaypro.  Decoded it.  Ex-
tracted everything with NULU151.COM (also ordered from the LISTSERV).  Using
a 300/1200 baud Avatex brand partially Hayes compatible modem,  I fired it up.
It sat there,  dead still.  No response of any kind.  With the modem on,  the
screen starts a pyrotechnic display that 15 years ago I would have considered
a cheap high.  This machine was gone.  Had to push the reset.  I traced exe-
cution with DDT and here's what I saw:

       PC          Instruction
      ====         ===========
      0100         NOP
      0101         NOP
      0102         LXI  H,0000*0105
      0105         DAD  SP*0106
      0106         SHLD 0506*0109
      0109         LXI  SP,4082*010C
      010C         LXI  D,4000*010F
      010F         LXI  H,05F9*0112
      0112         LXIB,05FA*0115
      0115         ??=  ED*425D
      425D         RST  07*425D   and the PC is 425D forever after.

This emulator was written in Z80 by Ray Rizzuto and he used Z80MR as an
assembler (which I notice is also available from this LISTSERV).  He states
in his accompanying documentation that this is written for non-graphic versions
of the Kaypro and you guessed it mine is a graphics version.

Has anyone used this emulator?  Is there an updated version available?
How about a fix of some kind (I'm not a Z80 whiz but I can stumble through
instructions)?  Or,  is there another VT52 emulator I can get?  Any help
would be greatly appreciated by myself and by several other Kaypro owners here
who are watching and waiting!

I am not on this list so please write to me directly.  Thanks!

P.S.  Once  - ONCE - after jiggling the modem cable,  I got the modem to
auto-dial,  but the screen was completely blank (not even a cursor).
Haven't figured that one out yet.

Subject: z80-cpm boards for IBM-PCs

  I would be interested in anybody's experiences and recommendations for
addin boards for IBM-PCs that run CPM and are based on the z80 processor.
It must have a parallel port capable of driving a centonics-type printer
interface and it would be nice if there were already software driver hooks
for passing data back and forth from the PC side to the CPM side that
appeared as a device to both (i.e. assign as device or use as source or
destination in copy/pip commands) but this is not essential.

Subject: Help with Heath Z-89 and ZCPR-3....

Hello,

    I have a problem maybe someone out there can help me with.  I have
a HEATH Z-89 computer with a Magnolia Sasi Interface card and a 20 Meg
winnie on which I'd like to install Z-COMM/ZCPR-3.  My problem is that
Z-COMM will install alright but it won't recongnize the Floppy drives. 
After talking to the folks are Echelon about it, I decided to return 
Z-COMM and put up with vanilla Magnolia CPM 2.2.04.  Well it's been about
6 months and I'm getting pretty tried of not having all the neat features
of a Z-SYSTEM so here are my options:

	1) Buy the BIOS sources from Magnolia and do a manual 
	   installation ($75.00 for the sources plus the work to
	   do the installation)

	2) Buy CPM 3.0 system board from Magnolia ($175.00) and wait
	   for ZCPR-33 to be implemented on CPM 3.0

	3) Bring up my Heath version of CPM 2.2.03 and implement
	   Magnolia's controller into that BIOS ($75.00 for source
	   again from Magnolia plus time to implement the controller 
	   into the Heath BIOS)

	4) Tollerate standard CPM (BTW I do use EZCPR)

	5) Buy an IBM compatable. (Notice it's the last option!!!)

Any other options ?  My ideal choice is to find someone whose implemented
ZCPR-33 with the Magnolia Version of CPM borrow there code to implement 
ZCPR-33. Anyone willing to give me a help in doing this ???


thanks,

Subject: HEX codes for CP/M-86

Frank,

I  found  a  hex code for MDM840.  For your information only, the
HEX file is identical to what my"asm86" produces.

I think that  CP/M-86  hex  files need  a  different  format  than
CP/M-80 COM files.

I would sure be interested in finding out why?

Again,  thanks fo your invaluable help thus far.  If you can find
any books on CP/M-86, please provide me the titles/author.

A new batch of PD utilities for CP/M-68K have been uploaded onto
SIMTEL20 and placed in PD1:<CPM.CPM68K> as MSUTILS.LBR.  This
library contains a number of usefull CP/M-68K programs (in MSDOS
style), including COPY, PROTECT, ERASE, SD, and many more.  Written
by Dave Wilcox (who has also done up a very extensive CP/M-68K
fortran statistics package with graphics capability (not PD, though)),
these routines should simplify a lot of common tasks.

The CRC for this file is 4C6Ah, and is about 135k long (lots of

This is a good idea and put me on the list, please, if is started.
Thanks in advance.

I've bought a Z280 and I will investigate if my chip is a broken
one. I need a correct chip 'cause I will exchange my old Z80
in my machine to a faster Z280. The Z80 is used as a (slow)
IO processor.

Last week I sent mail to this list about a CPM VT52 emulator for Kaypros that

that it is unresolvable.  Instead I have been pointed to MEX,  which,  I am
told,  has fair VT100 emulation.  MEX is commercially available with this fea-
ture (known as MEX-PLUS or something like that) for a hundred bucks.  Does any-
one know if any of the files in <CPM.MEX> are equivalent in functionality to the
commercialy avaliable version?

As long as I'm here...  I sort of have a way to FTP things now,  but we haven't
got a nameserver in operation.  Can someone tell me the numerical address of
SIMTEL20?  Thanks in advance!

Subject: Z280 wanted

I have seen information on the Z280 posted several times here.
What I would like to do is work in replacing the Z80 in a TRS-80
model 4 with a Z280.  Some of the features I would like it to
have include extended memory and greater speed.
  Can someone tell me where I can get a Z280 and how much do they
cost?

I  have  found a board for the Corvus hard drive that is supposed
to fit my Osborne Exec.  Only problem  is  I  don't  know  how  to
install  it.   I  have  a  20mb Corvus and would like to try and
connect the two.

Anyone have any ideas?

Thanks in advance

Subject: Wordstar 4.0 support

Some of you may recall that several months ago I posted a complaint
about Wordstar 4.0 failing to work on my hardware configuration and
about Micropro failing to give me any help whatsoever.

A few of you sent me hacks which might fix the problem, but I simply
haven't had time to hack with it.  (Why hack an 8080 when you can hack
a VAX?)

However, I continued to try to get official help from Micropro.  About
a month and a half after my first letter, I sent another one.  A month
and a half after that, I sent another one, this time with a copy going
to the president of the company and the director of customer services.
A week later, I got a check for $94 from them.

So, I guess Micropro has given up on customer service.  When a
customer has a problem, instead of helping him/her solve it, they
simply refund the money and blow it off.

Pretty bad customer relations policy, if you ask me.

It's a real pain in the a$$ to debug a foreign hardware configuration over the
phone. For the past three weeks, I've had that dubious pleasure, with folks in
California that have a very WEIRD modem/interface setup. Despite them reading
me the manuals over the phone line, and me saying "Gawd, that's the strangest
thing I've ever seen", we simply could not get the combination working right
with our program. Finally they said "hell, we'll just ship it to ya, and you
can figure it out over there instead of us running up a $500 phone bill". So
right now that combo is in transit via UPS... it simply is infeasible to try
to deal with strange hardware via remote control. 

However, I doubt that Micropro has the personel, management, or facilities to
do that, and besides, do you want to lose the use of your computer for 30 days
while Micropro figures out what's wrong? Certainly Micropro should have
written you a letter, telling you that they were sorry etc.  But I really
can't fault them for throwing up their hands and giving your money back. You
can't run a program on equipment you don't have.

I might agree with that in principal, but I think that in this case
you are wrong, because you are missing several very important facts
about my particular situation:

  1. Wordstar 3.33 worked PERFECTLY on my computer with no problems
whatsoever, and the new hardware driver is not very different from the
previous one.  Isn't compatibility supposed to increase when the
version number increases?

  2. MicroPro did not even make an effort to help me.  They didn't
call me, they didn't respond to my letters, and they apparently didn't
care whether I solved my problem or not.

  3. My hardware configuration is *not* unusual.  To say that it is
unusual for an Apple ][+ CP/M user to have an 80-column card other
than a Videx is ridiculous.  Furthermore, it would have taken then 0
minutes over the phone to replace the laser printers disk which was
fried when I received the software and which they never replaced.

Subject: Z-280 documentation

Several people mailed me asking for info about the Z-280 chip,
but my replies always bounced back.  So, here is some information:

 I got two at a place called Western Micro (a distributor) in
 Campbell, CA.  The were about $45 each.

 What you really need is the documentation.

 You need to order it from the factory.  The sales offices are usless
 for serious information.

 You want:  

 Z280 MPU Preliminary Product Specification	00-2259-05	N/C
 Z280 Technical Manual				03-8224-02	$15.00

 Send a check for the above amount, plus 10% for S/H, to:

 Zilog

 210 Hacienda Ave.
 Campbell, CA 95008-6609

 or call:  408 370-5987

I didn't knew that this part was alive (I know that Hitachi produces the
64180 but not that Zilog does the same as, obviously, second source).

Not my experience! Here in sweden they are very helpfull.
I've got all help I wanted (so far any way).

I have a "Baby Blue" board that I bought cheap at a close-out
sale and never got to work.  As far as I know, the ones still being
made (as advertised in magazines like Dr. Dobbs) go for around $200,
but I have no experience with them.

BUT, I have used the program Z80MU, which is a free Z-80+CP/M 
emulator done entirely in software, and available wherever good
public domain and shareware programs are.
It is not as fast as a real Z-80, but it is not bad.

Advantages:  Low cost (i.e. $00.00), access to all DOS facilities
(subdirectories, printers,  and so on) as well as all CP/M commands,
and support for large programs (a 60K Transient Program Area).
The authors estimate it runs at about the speed of
a 1MHz Z-80 on a standard 4.77 MHz IBM PC>

I have run the CP/M Microsoft BASIC interpreter and compiler,
and Turbo Pascal, with no trouble.

One other advantage is that it lets you run CP/M programs without having
to prepend a loader program to each one, 
which is required for the Baby Blue.

So, if you don't need to run lots of CP/M programs
(at least so many that speed is really important),
try Z80MU!
