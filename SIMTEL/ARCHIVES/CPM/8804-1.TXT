Subject: CONF for C128

I have been asked about how to get the program CONF mentioned in
a previous letter.

I am pretty sure it is available on GEnie, Compuserve, Q-link,
Simtel20, and from FOG.  It has also been included on the distribution
disks for the 1700/1750 ram expansion, and is on the newest 3.5 inch
(1581) distribution disk.  So far as I know, Commodore permits free
distribution of it.  If all else fails, leave me a mailing address,
and I can send a copy.  On GEnie or CIS check the C128 specific area
under the CP/M SIG.

Once you get a copy, you want to do CONF 40COL=OFF,BAU=110,FEEL=0.
I guarantee a significant difference!

                         Dateline April 1, 1988
                              Anaheim, CA

        Vengance Computing announces imminent production of it's totally
non-PC compatible computer, code-named "The Grudge".

        Co-Founder Tim Jones:  "Look, We've  seen  enough of all this PC
garbage, and certainly had to deal with enough of PC dos  to  last  us a
lifetime."

        Co-Founder Dave Vanhorn:  "I've been running Z-system for a long
time now, and I'm tired of  the  supremacist baloney from the PC crowd."

        "When IBM entered the market, they told us that we were doing it
all wrong and that they had all  the  answers.  Well,  they  were wrong.
Now they  want you to toss all the junk they sold you before and go with
OS/2...  (Remember the PC Jr?)"

        Vengance Computing has decided to come to market with a Z-system
engine which is based on  a  new  chip  which combines the familiar Z-80
family of chips into a single package.  The CPU, CTC, DART  and  PIO are
all nested into a single 100 pin flatpack chip.  The chip supports 6 Mhz
clock rates.

        The operating philosophy of Vengance Computing:

        "In our opinion, the PC  family  tree is a drug-induced mutation
of the Z-80 evolutionary path, and it's time we all woke up  and started
using real  computers  again  instead  of these brain-damaged appliance-
level toys which IBM and Intel have palmed off on us."


        The "Grudge", which is still  in the pre-production stage, has a
conventional floppy controller, paralell printer port with bidirectional
capability, two full-feature serial ports, and a SCSI interface for hard
disk interface and plug-in networking which supports four Mbyte/sec data
rates.  It also includes a real-time clock, and instead of the usual dy-
namic ram, has a full 64K of static, battery backed ram.

        The "Grudge" system will come  with bundled software, ZRDOS, and
ZCPR3.3.  Licencing arraingements on additional packages are still being
worked on.

        It will NOT run flight simulator or Lotus 1-2-3!

        The system BIOS code will not be copy protected. It will instead
be released to the public domain  in order to encourage improvements and
new ideas.  "We absolutely despise the philosophy  of  the closed archi-
tecture and  the  idea that a real computer user dosen't need BIOS code.
Rather than try to keep it  a  secret, we are giving it away....  Soon!"

        The systems will come to market in the upper $500 range and will
also have an optional 256K-8Mby ramdisk board which will plug in through
the expansion bus connector.  "We thought that the  ramdisk  was needed,
but we  remain skeptical of how many people will pay the estimated $2100
for the ram chips  to  fully  populate this option."  (Curent pricing on
1M  X  1  dynamic  rams  is  quoted  at  $32  each,  so  $32*8*8=$2048.)

        The "Grudge" board also includes intelligent caching  for disks,
with extra  memory  allocated  fot this task so as not to use TPA space.

        The systems  are  physically  similar  to  the  SB-180 and Ampro
Little Board computers, and are intended to mount in the  same cabinets.

        "We're also leaving room for other folk's add-on cards, and pro-
viding a pair of decoded I/O port banks for them to use."

        Future plans for the product line include a Z-280 main processor
which will take over the "Grudge" and  use it as an intelligent I/O pro-
cessor.  This Z-280 board (Code named "AVENGER") will run  on  a  16 bit
bus, and  will  include a direct controller for ST-506 type drives which
supports 10Mby/Sec transfer rates.  Installation will be plug-in with an
eprom change on the "Grudge" board.

        Another future add-on is a "Grudge"-to-PC bus interface allowing
the use of suitably cheap  PC  peripheral cards.  "They aren't real won-
derful either, but they are cheap and plentyful!"

        Grudge systems will be available 3rd quarter 88.

Sorry for the repost.  The processor I need info on is the TMS9918A, which
apparently the graphics chip of the 9900 series.  I say "apparently" because
in a book I found by TI that covered the 9900 series, the graphics
characteristics of the "U89" system (9900 based) appear to correspond exactly
to those of the 9918A.  However, this book does not actually mention the
9918A.  Thanks to the people who have responded, but I need info specifically
on the 9918A.

	Z320 is not Z80 compatible.
	As far as I know it is Z80000 packed into new box.
	So it is full 32-bit prosessor equipped

Regarding the query by Mike Ryan regarding the MEXPAT TIMEBASE parameter, I 
don't now what this does, and would be interested to know (in fact MEXPAT
does not seem to be very fully documented anywhere.  There is a file
MEX-BUFF.LBR, but I think that it only discusses the buffers part of MEXPAT).
I am not sure what exactly is meant by "buffer overrun" in this context.  MEX
has a "modem port queue" which can fill up when incoming data rates are high.
I have experienced this problem when running at 9600 baud and avoided it by 
setting STAT QUEUE OFF and having an external buffer with the ability to 
exercise flow control.

I'm sorry to say that my fingers got ahead of my brain when I said that

8" floppies are easily available from mail order houses and at surplus stores.

I have several 8" systems and several 5 1/4" systems; the reliability of the
8" drives is strictly a function of the controller implementation.  My
experience is that the 5 1/4" floppies are less reliable, overall, and the
8" drives are far more reliable than 5 1/4" drives.  I have my IMSAI with two
Tandon 848-2`s and a Tarbell DD controller set for 3ms step rates; it is still
very fast compared to an IBM PC when running WordStar, or a Televideo HD system
running CP/M.

Subject: 8" Hard disk for H89 H67 system

 I noticed that in the last of isssue of Computer Shopper there
were several ads for 8" hard disk that should be suitable for
replacing the one in the H67 unit. One ad had a Quantum 2010
for $69. Other prices went up to $300 for a thirty meg model.
With minimal reconfiguration, the H67 hardware and software
should handle the larger capacity drives also. Or as I mentioned
in my original response, one can use the internal sasi bus
adapter to talk to a DTC510 or XEBEC 1420 and anybody's 5"
st506 drive. These sasi controllers are available for less
than a hundred dollars, and there's a lot of 5" winchesters
around in the 5-40 megabyte range for $100-400. 
   If you're running CP/M, one small hassle is that the absolute
sector number is treated by the bios as a 16 bit unsigned
integer, whereas the controller uses a somewhat longer bit
pattern to address the drive. What this means is that to get
larger drives to work, you need to change the sector size
to 1024 bytes/sector so that you can still get to it all
with the bios. This is done by a jumper on the controller
board.
   I have a setup on my H89 that I've been running for about
4 years, using the internal H67 card and a DTC510 sasi
controller, with a variety of external drives. I never had
the 8" drives, so I had to write my own formatting and partitioning
software. If anyone still cares about this sort stuff, I'll
answer whatever questions you might have. Clarence Wilkerson

Subject: Software for kids ...

My son turned three a couple of months ago and has taken an inordinate
interest in my wifes PC-compatible. Actually its not so inordinate since
Daddy spends his entire day playing with 'puters. He's got his own floppy
now, but it doesn't do anything (yet). Anyway, the PC compatible was moved
to work (for my wife) and I'm thinking about giving him an older CP/M
system. So far his interest has been based on getting characters to print
at the dos-prompt, and overloading the buffer 'til it beeps. Pretty simple.

He's only three, so at this stage I envision that a simple program which
displays a *BIG* character on the display in response to a keystrike will be
pretty entertaining 'til he learns where most of the keys are. Then I
figured that I could down-size the characters from 80x24 to maybe 5x7 so
that he could work on words. As I'm under severe pressure to finish my
dissertation I would prefer not to spend the time writing this (admittedly
simple) code.

Actually, any simple program that would respond to keystrokes with pretty
significant environmental changes would probably be interesting. Adventure-like
games are a little too advanced, might as well hack at the system prompt ...

Anyway, can anyone point me to CP/M "kiddy"/"educational" software? Anything
public-domain? I'd bet that there must be some for the C64/128, but it's
probably in cartridge form. I need 5 1/4" format.

I haven't a C compiler and am not prepared to go back to ASM. I do have
an old BASIC somewhere ... maybe BASIC source would be my best bet. Anyone
have any source? Even PC-based BASIC code for a mono, non-graphic environment
would be useful. The terminal is an ADM31 I believe (a Morrow system);
don't recall whether there is a graphic font.

BTW, what's the easiest way to get a beep into a CP/M system? Seems I could
cycle a bit on a parallel port and drive an amp; I could simply gate an
oscillator with the bit (NE555?); or I could drive a synthesizer chip.
Suggestions? What's a cheap, easy-to-use synthesizer chip?

Pointers, help, suggestions gratefully accepted. Other folks must have
(have had) kids in a CP/M world. What do (did) they do?

An associate needs a version of kermit for mpm v1.0.  We didn't use kermit when
mpm was being used around here, so there wasn't ever a version archived.  Does

This question crops up every couple of months.  Here's a repost of my X-10
bibliography dated 1 Apr 87 01:23:13 GMT.  [Parenthetical notes signed "psf"
come from a followup by psfales@ihlpe.ATT.COM (Pete Fales), dated 3 Jan 88]

o "Computerize a Home"
  by Steve Ciarcia
  Byte, January 1980, page 28
  Notes:  An overview of the X-10 system is presented, along with some photos
	and block diagrams of the commercial system.  Special attention is
	given to the ultrasonic command wand which communicates with the base
	station and can control any of the units under the house code that the
	base station is set to.  One suggestion is presented that uses a pair
	of CMOS MUX chips to simulate matrix closures in the control keypad.
	This approach is discouraged.  Steve then goes on to describe an
	interface that takes commands from a parallel port and sends them
	ultrasonically to the X-10 box.  $80, plus cable, interface, and power.
	[Includes a complete description of the format of the ultrasonic
	signals - psf]

o "Plug-in Remote Control System"
  by Steve Ciarcia
  Radio Electronics, September 1980, page 47
  Notes:  Better details on the inside of the X-10 system, including schematics
	of the base station, lamp module, and appliance module.  No buildable
	project, just lotsa nice info.

o "A $5.25 Interface to the BSR X-10 Home Control System"
  by Alan Trimble
  Byte, September 1980, page 314
  Notes:  A Z-80 assembly routine is presented to directly drive a 40 kHz
	transducer.  This provides a software-intensive, but low budget way to
	do what Steve Ciarcia did in Byte, January 1980, page 28.

o "Apple X10 Control"
  by Wayne Arczynski
  Byte, December 1981, page 469
  Notes:  A 6502 version of Alan Trimble's software-driven ultrasonic
	transducer.  This version is intended for the Apple II.

o "Ask Byte"
  by Steve Ciarcia
  Byte, December 1981, page 254
  Notes:  More information about using relays to "press" buttons on an existing
	X-10 base station.  Also a suggestion about bypassing the ultrasonic
	link by injecting the signal into the control circuitry via an opto-
	isolator.

o "An 8080-Based Remote Appliance Controller"
  by David Staehlin
  Byte, January 1982, page 239
  Notes:  An optoisolator is used to couple a home computer into an existing
	base station.  Most of the article is fancy control software to make
	it all work.

A more recent article (Radio Electronics 1985, I think) describes a dedicated
single-board computer for home control purposes.  It includes direct generation
of X-10 signals and injection into the AC line.

A bit over a year ago, Steve Ciarcia described his "Home Run" computer system
with similar capabilities.  I can look these up, if you need them.
[ "Build The Home Run Control System - Part 2: The Hardware"

Subject: Copying Diskettes

I have some 5 1/4 inch diskettes, containing CP/M programs, which I would
like to copy.  The problem is that I do not have access to a CP/M machine
at the moment.  Is there any way to copy these using an IBM PC?  I have two
programs for the IBM called "Copy Write" (by McQuaid, I believe), and 
"Copy II PC".  These are so called "bit-copiers", not file copiers.

It is my hope that such utilities will not attempt to format the disk, but
will simply copy the contents, CP/M format and all, without doing any
checkng.  Does anyone out there know if either of these will successfully 
make the copy?

Thanks in advance.

Well, I have one.  It's for cp/m mode and it handles all the extra characters
for your keyboard (like the tilda and so on) and is quite easy to use.  Only
problem: no manual.  Good News:  free-ware.  If you drop your name and address
to me throught the mail, I'll send you a copy.  I'll try to find the name of
the guy I got mine from - I got a disk and quite a few useful programs for the
cp/m mode for about $5, along with a catalog.

It must be true.  The two Qume DT-8's that I'm using are only 9 years
old.  Had to get them cleaned and re-aligned last year, so they must
not be very dependable.  Course, my system is only used every day for
only 6-8 hours. ;-}

I did break down last year and buy a newer Qume Track 842 and added it
to the stack.  

I am worried about my hard disk, though, it's 8 years old, and still
formats without any errors other than those listed on the factory stat
sheet.  It's an 8" Quantum 2040, with considerable miles also.

YOu'd think that IMS, Industrial Micro Systems, the manufactuer of my
S-100, would have made better systems back in 1979.......

	I have a set of old Shugart 851 (DS/DD 8" drives) which
	I cleaned once (I think - maybe not at all) since a bought
	them 5-6 years ago -- and they were used when I bought them!
	During this time I have also cleaned a great number of 5.25"
	drives repeatedly and replaced two of them (one on a compaq &
	the other on an NEC APC III)

	I guess they just didn't make systems as well back then. :-)

	Moral:  They're like the old V-8s, not as much power/area
		(or in this case tracks/inch) but YOU CAN'T KILL 'EM!


	Also,  if you switch to 5.25" for CP/M, what format will you
	use?  You won't be able to xfer stuff as easily either.
	(or at least I wont)  Remeber: 8" SSSD format is STANDARD
	for all (ok, well 90%) of the CP/M machines!

I cannot comment on the two programs you asked about, but I CAN tell you that 
there are programs which will allow a PC/compatible to read certain CP/M(r) disks.
For example, there is Media Master and Uniform (or is that UniformPC?).  I know
a tiny bit about MM (Media Master (probably TM, now that I think about it, as 
probably is Uniform... Oh, well)).  MM allows you to read about 30 or 40 different
formats, including strange MS/dos formats, every Kaypro(TM?) disk except for
kaypro10 disks FORMATTED by a Kaypro 10 (there is a bug in the k10 format routine!),
etc.

Also, Dr. Dobbs magazine carries some ads for media read/write programs.  Seems to 
me that one of them only cost about $50-$100.

The advantage of all of this is that not only do you get to copy the disk to 
another CP/M disk of the same format, but you actually have access to the data
and files on the CP/M disks, so you could change to another CP/M (oh, yes, TM
by someone) format or even put the stuff on MS/Dos (tm) disks.   And, if you
have a CP/M (tm) emulator for your PC, you can run those programs (assuming
all legal licensing problems, if any, are taken care of)...

(Side note: this (TM) stuff can get really rediculous.  Not quite sure why I bothered,
but it seemed like the thing to do at the time.)

    It is true, but if you shop around at electronics store you
can probably locate them.  There were several electronics stores that
I have seen the 8" floppy disk drives still, but few and usually with
no warranty.  I have never seen a machine using 8" floppies but I have
never seen one.  One of the places I believe I saw an 8" floppy is a
place in Lubbock, TX but I cannot remember the name of it.  Well, hope
you find some or find someone who still work on 8" floppies.



    Also, does anyone know where about's I can get 3/4 hight 5.25" disk drives?
My disk drives on the Zorba have just about had it, and so I need to get some
new drives and the Zorba uses 3/4 hight drives.









     Which one of these CP/M machines would be a good buy, or if there's
not a machine on the list that you'd like to specify, please specify it
anyways.  Thanks.  The machines are:

           [ ] TRS-80 Model 4
           [ ] Kaypro (model with 392k DS/DD disk drives)
           [ ] Xerox 820-II
           [ ] Osborne 1
           [ ] Osborne Executive
 
Any information would be appreciated.  Also, i'd like to know a price range
now days for what these machines are going for.

Unless I completely misunderstand your question, you don't need any PD
utilities.  Under CP/M 2.x use "stat filename.typ $sys" and under CP/M
3.x use "set filename.typ[sys]".  You may use wildcards in either file
spec.  These commands set the system attribute in the directory entry
which makes the file not appear in directory listings.  You may reset
the bit with "stat filename.typ $dir" or "set filename.typ[dir]".
Other attributes that may be manipulated are read-only/read-write and
the "archived" bit.

In addition, under CP/M 3.x, files in user area 0 with the system
attribute may be opened in read-only mode by programs running in any
user area.  Makes a good way to stash all your .com files.

Subject: Reading CP/M Discs with Media Master

I've not had much experience with other multi-format disk reading programs
(such as Uniform), but Media Master is a TURKEY!  I worked for a guy who
purchased it to transfer some old CP/M Wordstar files to an IBM PC.  He had
trouble with it and asked me to try it out.  I had some old Osborne diskettes
that it refused to read (I can do sector level reads on them with a Versafloppy
controller).  It made a good try with some Columbia Data 964?? diskettes.  The
directory came up but with all the wrong file sizes.  Copies of the files would
not run with their CP/M emulator.  It will not format Cromemco CDOS DS/DD 5 1/4"
so that I can write to them, and it will not read 5 1/4" CDOS diskettes created
on the Cromemco.  When I called the number that is on the Media Master docs.,
they were not only non-helpful, they were insulting ("your diskettes are bad"
(they weren't)...."you don't know what you're doing"...etc.).  I have yet to
find a format that works with their program besides standard MS-DOS.  You
might want to try it only as a last resort, and/or try it out on the format
you're interested in reading BEFORE you buy it.  As far as I'm concerned, it
isn't even worth the cost of a blank diskette to copy it on!

Subject: correction on X-10 remote controller/RS coco.

It is with some chagrin that I must retract my original assertion 
that the Radio Shack #26-3142 remote controller was just a BSR
unit with the name changed.  After some experimenting with my units I
can confidently say that the RS unit COMPLETELY IGNORES YOU if you try to
talk to it using RS232 voltage levels.

After making this determination, I opened up both units to look inside.
Both use the 80C48 microcontroller.  Both use 6116-2 RAM.  In fact, most of the 
components are the same.  This is to be expected.  So, I guess the only 
hardware design difference is in the computer interface circuitry.  The 
BSR unit has a 5 pin DIN receptacle that the cable to the computer
plugs into via a D-25-to-5-pin-DIN-plug adapter cable, and it is in the
same place as the DIN plug on the RS unit.  Perhaps, and I offer 
this only as sheer speculation, the pin functions on the DIN receptacle 
on the RS unit vis a vis I/O are the same as the functions on the DIN
receptacle on the BSR unit, and the only difference is the voltage 
levels they operate at.  If this is the case, here are the pinouts on my 
BSR unit (which operates on RS-232 voltage levels).

There is a good possibility that the control codes in the RS unit are the 
same as the codes in the BSR unit, so my offer to mail a copy
of my BSR X10 Programmers Reference still stands, if anyone is interested
and will send me a USmail address.

Subject: Media Master

Roger,
  Don't know what version of MediaMaster you are using, but, from our
experience, it sounds like you have gotten a different product from a
different company.  We have (usually) found them very responsive when we
have called them, and have used versions of MediaMaster... 
 1) On Rainbows, under CP/M86-80, to read and write SSDD PCDOS
diskettes, SS Osborne diskettes, Kaypro diskettes (subject to the bug
earlier mentioned), SuperBrain diskettes, and a few other things. Most 
of these require driving the 80 track drive in every-other-track mode 
and we have had few problems (the ones we have had *can* be attributed 
to individual diskettes or source machines, since others from the same 
type of machines and software have worked and the problems have been 
tracked back to slightly out-of-alignment drives or otherwise 
mis-recording).
  2) On DDOsborne Is, reading and writing IBM PC PCDOS diskettes (the DD
Ozzie handles most of the CP/M formats that it can handle at all
internally, so MediaMaster has not been needed -- but we have used MM on
the Ozzie to format diskettes in the formats of a few other systems and
used those diskettes successfully thereafter). 
  3) On the IBM PC, to read and write a number of CP/M formats, and 
several deviant MSDOS formats.  We had no problems with any of these 
that were within the limitations of the controller (e.g., I know of no 
one who has succeeded in getting a PC or PC/XT diskette controller to 
deal with single density diskettes, and MediaMaster seems to be a good 
program, not a miracle.  Recently, we added a replacement controller and
a 1.2Mb drive to one of the XTs, with the intention of being able to 
read and write Rainbow 400Kb floppies on the XT.  Media Master manages 
to make that work too, for both Rainbow MSDOS and CP/M formats, but, at 
present, seems to leave the controller in an indeterminate state (i.e., 
MM works fine, but, once we leave it, we need to reboot the machine in 
order to use the diskette drives again).  The problem is likely with the 
controller, or the XT BIOS, but Intersecting Concepts (Media Master) has 
been reasonably helpful to us with trying to debug that too.

We've even made design suggestions to them, and a fair number have shown 
up in subsequent versions.  The only thing we've asked for that they 
have not done is support for VMS Files-11 formats on the Rainbow, and I 
understand and sympathize with their reasons.

I've tried their CP/M software emulator for the IBM PC, and it seems to 
work, but, other than assembling a few programs, I haven't pushed it 
hard enough to have a good opinion.

As I say, I think we may be using a different product, from a different 
company.  Or one of us has weird hardware.

No, we have no affiliation with Intersecting Concepts or Media Master.

with anything I haven't designed and/or written myself, and not often 
those).

Subject: User numbers > 15
I have recently re-assembled my ZCPR3.3 to allow use of user numbers 0-31 by
simply altering the HIGHUSER flag. I have been a little surprised with a couple
of difficulties that have arisen since.

1) BGii (version 1.13) will not allow me access to users above 15, even though
I have set it that way with SETBG, (I know it says in the manual that it gets
the info from Z) and it replaces a ZCPR3.3 which allows access. SHOW even
says access is allowed if SHOW is run under BGii. I assume that I am doing (or
not doing) something stupid! Any ideas anyone?

2) CD (version 3.3) does not like users above 15 either. This seems to be
independent of whether there is named directory entry for the user area.

Subject: BUG in VLU and TCVIEW12

(Minor) BUG with VLU.COM and TCVIEW12.COM
Both these useful programs fail to deal correctly with a TCAP with an
escaped characater in one of the control strings. In my case I need to send
a null as part of the standout string. This is taken as the string terminator,
and the real terminating null ends the 'reverse video off' string immediately.
This results in a VLU with the entire screen in reverse video. The back-slash
character which prefixes the null is sent to the screen, but fortunately it
does no damage! I have not worked out a patch yet for either program, but
I have adopted a work-around for my own system, which masks the 'null' byte
before using it, so I can simply use a character with enough zero bits at the
bottom, but which is not all zero. I hope this is a help to anyone who has a
similar problem. When I get time I will try out as many programs as possible,
as I suspect that this bug could be quite widespread. When I first got my
Z-system I set up a TCAP with reverse-video, but dropped it as some programs
produced such awful screens. This may have been the problem.

Subject: CP/M 2.2 PUBlic files

Brian R. Lair asks if there is a way to access user-0 SYStem
files in read-only mode from another user number.

If the need is only for LOADING COM files (by the command processor)
from other user numbers, then the ZCPR3... search path will do the job
nicely.  If you want PROGRAMS to have automatic access to files in
other user numbers, more is needed.

In my Dr. Dobbs' Journal article (CP/M 2.2 Goes PUBlic, 
I think Nov. '84) I described the following approach to
automatically accessing files from other user numbers:

The CP/M 2.2 BDOS can be modified to make specified files on
a drive "PUBlic".  PUBlic files are accessible from any user
number on the drive, and signified by the f2' bit (filename byte 2,
bit 7); they are read-write and can be used for virtual memory
(swap file) as well as loading COM, overlay, LIB, etc files from
another user number.

Subsequently, P2DOS, PZDOS and Z80DOS have incorporated this
PUBlic functionality.

PUBPATCH, a Z-80 patch for an *UNMODIFIED DRI CP/M 2.2 BDOS*
is listed in the article.  The files are available on simtel20.

Subject: Media Master and Uniform

   I, too, was puzzled by the uncomplimentary message about Media Master.  I
have been using it on my PC computers for many years to convert numerous
CP/M formats.  I have had few, if any, problems, and I, too, have found the
manufacturer, Intersecting Concepts, to be most helpful and responsive.
 
   While on this subject, let me add some information on the relative merits
as I see them, of UNIFORM and Media Master on a PC type machine.  First I
like both of them.  Both support a vast number of formats.
 
   UNIFORM allows one of the drives to become a virtual CP/M drive, allowing
any DOS operation to be performed directly on files on the CP/M disk.  This
is very handy.  Unfortunately, UNIFORM does not know how to handle user
numbers correctly.  It warns you when there are files in user areas other
than 0, but it mashes them all together on reads.  On writes, UNIFORM
actually makes unnecessary modifications to the CP/M directory, permanently
changing user numbers of files in areas other than zero, and (most
unfortunately) destroying the order -- and hence the DateStamper time stamps
-- of all the files!  So, use UNIFORM with great caution and never on a
DateStamped disk you care about.
 
   Media Master does not create a virtual disk and is used only to perform
specific operations on files, such as copying them to or from the DOS disk. 
Media Master transfers files extremely rapidly (I don't know how they manage
that -- they are far faster than DOS itself).  UNIFORM is often very slow,
by the way (though not as horribly slow as I sometimes find it for some
foreign formats on my CP/M SB180).  Media Master does know about and deal
with user areas by allowing you to select the user area to work with (I
don't see why UNIFORM can't figure out how to do something like this, but
their programmer wrote to me that it "can't be done").  Media Master does
not damage the CP/M disk directory or time stamps.

   Brian Lair asked about gaining public access to files in user 0.  The
Echelon Z System (with ZRDOS) allows files in designated directories to

Mitchell will leave a message on where it can be found) that implements
something quite similar to the CP/M-Plus system.

Subject: The Highuser Option in ZCPR33

   The maximum user area displayed by SHOW.COM is not the highest one you
can log into but the highest one you are allowed to reference.  SHOW does
display on one of its screens whether or not the Z33 command processor will
log into high user numbers.  Z33 (and Z34) is the only command processor
that optionally allows user numbers above 15 to be logged into, and there is
considerable risk in doing so.  I implemented that feature as an
intellectual challenge for experimenters who do not mind living on the edge. 
I do not recommend logging into high user areas as a matter of course.
 
   The fact that CD33 will not log into them is a reflection of the sanity
normally built into that program.  It is smart enough to check DU and DIR
references for a valid login range.  It was an oversight that it does not
check the HIGHUSER option bit in the Z33 command processor to see if the
high user numbers are allowed.  I will try to get someone to make the
required change (not at all difficult, since there is a Z33LIB library
routine for checking the HIGHUSER flag bit, I believe).
 
   With Z34 and the extended environment, there is a full drive vector to
replace the overly simplistic maxdrive byte.  CD should be upgraded to
observe the limits imposed by that vector in addition to the maxdrive limit. 
In this way, CD can, like the Z34 command processor, respect holes in the
drive map.

Subject: User numbers > 15

ZCPR v 3.3 and v 3.4 include a "highuser" assembly option that permits
the command processor to log into user numbers 16...31.  When this
is done, the command processor's logged-in drive/user number is stored
in the ZCPR3 message buffers, and the value at 0003h is not valid.

Programs that refer to 0003 will probably run incorrectly, so
you need to check them carefully.  Other programs may (a) prevent
access to a user number > 15, (b) mask the high bits of a user number,
and thus convert a number > 15 into 0...15, which could cause
some nasty behavior, or (c) be just fine.  Because of these
difficulties, I suggest that the highuser option not be used.

BGii (BackGrounder ii) does NOT support logging into a "highuser"
user number; what it does support is references in the command tail to
user numbers up to the MAXUSER value (0...31).

Under BGii , this won't work:

	A>A31:

But this will (with MAXUSER = 31)

	A>DIR A31:*.*

Perhaps the place in Lubbock that you were thinking of was Texas
Instruments.  In any case, 8" floppy disk drives are still manu-
factured and still very easy to get ahold of... except possibly
at Radio Shack.

As for which of the computers you listed would be a good buy, that
depends highly on price, condition, features, and what you plan to
use it for.  The Xerox 820 is widely supported by the users, and
widely available at hamfests and from surplus dealers.  I'd avoid
the Radio Shack/Tandy computers.  Their CP/M was not really standard,
due to hardware constraints on memory locations.

     Yes.  There is a patch for the 2.2 BDOS from Plu*Perfect Software
that will enable this feature.  Look for PUBPAT.LBR on your local RCP/M.
Or, you can email me, and I'll send you a copy.

     On the other hand, there is a better way.  Install a different BDOS.
You can use ZRDOS, from Echelon.  This allows you to mark a specific DU:
as "public."  Any file you place there can be found from anywhere else.
 
     There is also P2DOS/SUPRDOS/Z80DOS/etc.  These do roughly the same
thing, although better ( im my opinion ).  They use attribute bit F2
to mark a file as public.  If this bit is set, the file can be found
from anywhere else on the drive.  Example:  I have WS.COM and the overlays
in user 0 with the F2 bit set.  Now, I try to edit a file in C5:.  WS
looks in C5:, and doesn't find its overlays.  Next, it switches to drive
A:.  The files aren't in A5:, but in A0:.  The BDOS, on the other hand,
makes it *look* like they're in user 5, so that WS works.

     Any more questions?

Subject: Failed to install P2DOS on Apple

Yesterday I tried to install P2DOS. As CP/M image file I used CPM60.COM,
for the APPLE with Softcard 60K.
As DOSSTRT address I used DC00h (high memory) and the image location
(in CPM60.COM) was 1800h. I was able to make a P2DOS.HEX file without
problems, thereafter I used DDT to load the hex file into CPM60.COM.
I saved the new CPM60.COM file as P2DOS.COM. So, I installed the new
CPM image onto a fresh disk.
I tried to do a coldstart from the new disk and my system went bananas!
I checked every step again, but I couldn't find any mistake.
Is anyone out there who can give me a hint ?

Subject: Media Master

  My recent post about problems I have had with Media Master was intended
as a warning to folks who might purchase the product for reading CP/M
diskettes, and then discover that it will not work with the particular
format of interest.
  I assumed, after seeing the number of messages from "satisfied"
customers that have appeared in the last year or so, that it DOES work --
particularly on the more common formats such as Kaypro, Osborne, DOS, etc.
I was disappointed with it, and with the vendor.
  I was trying to use it on a vanilla IBM/PC/XT, attempting to read
diskettes that I was able to read on other machines.  We had no
problems with reading and writing standard MS-DOS diskettes on the
IBM in question, or with copying files to and from it....nothing that
would suggest alignment difficulties.  It was very surprising to me
to have trouble with the Cromemco CDOS format.  A format as common as
that should have been tested...quite a lot.
  The fact remains:  if at all possible, try it out with your format
**BEFORE** spending your money.  DON'T ASSUME THAT IT WILL WORK WITH
ALL THE ADVERTISED FORMATS.  You may be disappointed.

Does Media Master support formats other than CP/M?  How about 8",
5.25" high density, and 3.5" formats?  What disk controllers does
it support?

Uniform supports the Maynard FDC-8 disk controller, and the Micro
Solutions Compaticard, which handles all the above disk formats.

I use Uniform extensively, and highly recommend it.  But don't expect
programs like Media Master to work on a non-standard disk controller
unless explicitely supported.  The fact that you can do a sector read
on the disk the "hard way" doesn't mean that the program will work
properly with that controller.

I contacted Pickles & Trout directly a year or two ago.  They no longer
directly support their CP/M product.  However, Trisoft in Austin, Texas
does continue to sell the Pickles and Trout CP/M for the Model II.  They
also offer pretty good support should a user have any questions.

Among its other features, QP/M has a built-in (user-definable) path which
allows any files along that path to be opened as read/only (if not in the
current drive/user).  This is part of the DOS so that any files that are
opened from the CCP or inside an executable program will work just fine.

Wrong, Jay.  QP/M (which you may not know about, although it has been around
since 1983) has always offered 31 user areas.  In fact, *all* of the programs
associated with it (QSTAT, QPIP, CD, DIR, MAKE, etc.) know about 32 user
areas.

Here, I agree with Jay.  I have found it *very* rare that anyone needs that
many user areas.  Clearly, you never would want it on a floppy (not enough
storage to make it worthwhile).  Furthermore, CP/M+ trashes files above user
number 15 (it only looks at users 0 to 15 to make the allocation bit map) if
given half a chance.

On a hard drive, if you seem to be exceeding the limit, you should look at
your hard drive setup.  You might consider breaking your hard drive up into
smaller logical drives which should give some breathing room.

Although QP/M has always supported 31 user areas, most of the public programs
which support du: have problems above user 15 (especially if they want to
be compatible with CP/M+).  I agree with Jay that it should be used with
some care.

 I suggest you patch the directory entries. MBASIC also allowed lower 
case file names. If you have MBASIC, you might try
NAME "oldfile" AS "newfile"
to change the file name! At last, a use for BASIC.....

I have run across similar problems with the Apple Softcard.  Apparently,
Apple uses a completely non-standard BDOS for the Softcard.  In fact,
there is not a clear split between the BDOS and BIOS as with other
systems.  Because of the way the Apple II handles bank-switched memory,
any changes or replacements to the BDOS and/or BIOS must be customized
for the machine, and almost no standard 'drop-in' replacements will
work.

As an example, there is a special file in the Simtel20 CPM.APPLE
archives for installing ZCPR3 with Softcard CP/M, that does some
non-standard patches to get it to work properly.

Apple did maintain almost all of the BDOS and BIOS call conventions,
so it might be possible to get a replacement BDOS to work.
If anyone does, I'd sure like to hear about it!

John, the command tail is a command that you normally type in on
CP/M's command line like this:

A>ED MYFILE.TXT
     ^--this part

When you run the emulator you probably type something ahead of the ED
in the example above.  Since CP/M can only handle two FCB's on the
command line it becomes necesssary for the emulator to ask for the
command tail.

     How did you create them?  With BASIC?  Microsoft's 'wonderful"
BASIC will allow you to create lower case filenames... why, I don't know.

     You have two possibilities:

		1) Rename the files ( which may be easier )
		2) Use a program that does *not* require input from
		   the command line.

     If you're going to try #2, I suggest NSWP.  It should have no problem
with the lower case name.  One moment, while I check...

     OK, NSWP *does* know what to do with the filename.  The "F"ind 
command won't locate it in the list ( probably due to the fact that
it's capitalizing it's input ), but if you step along to it, and "T"ag
it, then use the "Y" command to set its SYStem attribute, you can make it
disappear.

     'Nuff said.

I was unsuccessful in sending mail to Rusty, so I am replying to the
Net.  Can anyone give more information on this "bug".  I have an '83
Kaypro 10 and have never had problems with diskettes formatting, or
using them on my wife's Kaypro 4'83.

Thanks...cal.
PS.  I know Z80 assembler, have hacked my BIOS/BDOS, so don't spare
the details on this bug.

 I promised Don Kirkpatrick a full report of what I did. Here it comes:
 - my configuration is an Apple ][+ with 64 K of RAM, for running CP/M
   I have a Softcard 60K with a Z80 processor.
   I run the Apple Softcard CP/M 2.23 (to coldstart).
 - On my system disk there are two files to generate a startup disk,
   nl. CPM56.COM and CPM60.COM, which are similar to the SYSGEN program.
   The difference is that CPM60.COM has a copy of the CPM image inside
   the com file and with a SYSGEN program one has to save it.
 - I used the CPM60.COM to generate a new CP/M com file.
   addresses in image file          addresses in high memory
   =======================          ========================
   CCP:  F00h - 17FFh               CCP:  D300h
   BDOS: 1800h - 26FFh              BDOS: DC00h
   BIOS: 2700h - 2CFFh              BIOS: FA03h

   P.S.: This are the addresses which I think the CCP, BDOS and BIOS
         probably begin ? If NOT correct please let me know, because
         the whole installation procedure falls or stands with it !
 - In file P2DOS.MAC I filled the following values in :
   DOSSTRT = DC00h
   SE RI AL NU MB ER = BD 16 00 00 EC B8
   ORG = 100h
   I assembled P2DOS.MAC with the M80 assembler.
   B>a:m80 =p2dos   (no errors were produced)
   B>a:l80 p2dos,p2dos/x/n/e  (to generate the p2dos.hex file)
 - type p2dos.hex gives :
       :20DC0000BD160000ECB8...
          ----  ------------
          BDOS  serialnumber

 - Combined CPM60.COM with P2DOS.HEX using DDT:
   B>DDT CPM60.COM
     -f 1800 26FF 0  (to fill with zeroes)
     -d 1800         (check if made zero)
     -i p2dos.hex
     -r 1700
     -d 1800         (check if p2dos is there)
     -^C
   B>save 44 P2DOS.COM  (new CP/M image file)
   B>P2DOS              (on a fresh disk, writes system tracks)
 - Switch Apple ON/OFF and insert new CP/M startup system disk.
   RESULT= a lot of noice, and over and out.
 - Some final considerations :
   * who has experience with installing a new Apple CP/M image file ?
   * why not sharing some specific Apple CP/M details about the BDOS,
     BIOS and all the rest I don't know about.
   * I could write a technical report about our results and submit it
     to SIMTEL20. Fair or not ? I say don't waste energy, because there
     will be a time we'll be glad we have some left !

on the drive are pretty obvious, but some of the others are not
so.  Will somebody please explain??  Below is a representation of

From: TReed.ElSegundo@Xerox.COM
Subject: Visual, CTRL P,  state indicator

Is there a modified or replacement version of the CPM operating system that gives a visual indication of the state of the CTRL P function (Output to LST: Yes/No)?  Perhaps some character in the upper right hand corner of the display is toggled, or perhaps the character used as the cursor. 

This may sound like a trivial problem particularly if you have an impact printer  because you will have immediate feedback as to the state of the CTRL P when you make an entry.  On the other hand even if you do get immediate feedback you may still want to know the state of CTRL P before you start making entries.

However the ability to determine the state of CTRL P is more significant if you are using a laser printer (which I believe will become more and more the case) because they are silent until a page is ready to be printed.  At that point in time you may or may not have wanted printed output.

Anything around as a solution to the problem?  Does it spark any ideas?

Thanks,
Terry V. Reed

It seems the simplest way to deal with the lower case file names is to
use MBASIC to rename it. It is an isolated case and shouldnt be

Subject: Visible ^P BDOS status

It's going to be difficult to come up with a portable method of
providing visible reporting of ^P status.  Here are some rough
thoughts.

1. Determining the status.  Unlike CP/M Plus, CP/M 2.2 and its
emulators (ZRDOS, QP/M, ...) have no status-reporting function.
You could:
	a) locate the status byte in your particular BDOS, by
	disassembly.
	b) write an RSX to intercept console output functions (and
	   warmboot) and emulate the toggling of ^P.  The warmboot
	   trap will need to account for the fact that
	   the BDOS will now not be reloaded on warmboot, and the
	   status byte therefore  not reset.  Without an RSX in place
	   your BDOS may or may not be reloaded on warmboot, depending
	   on the BIOS implementation of the warmboot function.
	   Initializing the shadow status byte in your RSX is a
	   problem, unless you know where the BDOS's byte is.  (i.e.
	   what if ^P is ON when you load the rsx?)	
	c. Patch the BDOS so that it will call a routine when it changes ^P
	   status.  Locate the routine the BIOS or other protected memory. 
	   You will need to take care that the shaddow status in your routine
	   is correct after a warmboot; the best thing would be for
	   your routine to inspect the status byte in the BDOS.	

2. Detecting change in status.
	a. Have an interrupt-service routine triggered by a clock
	   countdown that checks ^P status once in a while.
	b. Have the RSX update the cursor/25th line if it is emulating
	   ^P toggling.
	c. be called by the BDOS patch (1c above).

3.  Displaying status.  This will require terminal-specific data.
Changing the cursor type can usually be done by sending an escape
sequence to conout.  An alternative is to display an enduring message
on the "25th line" of terminals with such a feature.  (A message
located on a regular text line will quickly scroll off the screen.)  Be
sure to call BIOS conout so you don't recurse in the BDOS!

Trenton Computer Festival '88

                                                April 20, 1988
                                                Jay Sage

Since no one else has uploaded an official file about the Trenton Computer
Festival, I have composed this one myself.

The festival will take place on Saturday, April 23, from 9 am to 6 pm and
Sunday, April 24, from 10 am to 4 pm on the Trenton State College campus.

There will be more than five acres of flea market, rain or shine, and more
than a dozen technical sessions running in parallel!  One of the technical
sessions on Saturday will concentrate on Z System.  I will be speaking on
NZCOM and Z3PLUS.  If time permits, I may talk about ARUNZ as well.  Hal
Bower will present the new ZSDOS disk operating system.  Bruce Morgen will
be there, and others as well, I am sure.  We hope to see you there, too.

Admission is at the door only.  Fee for both days: $7 for adults, $3 for
students and senior citizens, free for preschool children.  Sunday only
admissions are: $5 for adults, $3 students and seniors, free for children
under 12 accompanied by an adult.  FREE PARKING is available, with shuttle
buses from overflow parking areas.  Follow posted signs to parking areas.
For more information, contact Trenton State College at 609-771-2667.

DIRECTIONS:

Railroad: Trenton is on the main service line of AMTRAK.  The railroad
station is in the city, five miles from the campus.  The NJ Transit-Mercer
"G-Trenton State College" bus goes from the station directly to the campus.

Plane: The Mercer County Airport is located within two miles of the campus.
It serves airlines offering daily flights between Trenton and Washington,
Philadelphia, and Newark.  Taxi service is available at the airport.

Automobile: The college is most easily reached by automobile.  Trailblazers
at key intersections near the college will help with directions.

from Newark and North Jersey: Exit from the NJ Turnpike at New Brunswick,
exit 9.  Take Route 18N to Route 1; then follow Route 1 South.  Leave Route
1 at I-295 to 95 and travel south toward Pennsylvania.  Take exit 4,
Pennington Road South.  Continue on Pennington Road (Route 31) south through
the traffic light at Ewingville Road intersection to the college.  The
college is on the left about 0.4 mile from the light.

from Pennsylvania: Follow I-95 North and cross the Scudder Falls Bridge to
Route 31 (Pennington Road) Exit 4A.  Then follow directions above.

     One possibility would be to tell L80 to make a hex file with an origin
at the location you need.  It doesn't have to start at 0100H, you know.

     Why is something like this necessary?  The image is up in memory,
*above* where DDT/SID/ZSID will load.  SYSGEN will load below this.

Subject: looking for CPM emulator for UNIX

Does anyone know of a  CP/M emulator which runs under  UNIX?   (Or  in
fact, a Z80 or 8080 emulator?)  Right now,  speed  and/or completeness
and/or implementation     restrictions      and/or  flavor   of   UNIX
considerations wouldn't disqualify anything (I'm willing to work at it
a little bit).  This is for personal, non-commercial use only, if that
matters.

Just  so there is no misunderstanding,  I'm  looking for  a completely
software-based emulation.  That is, nothing that  involves wiring up a
framis chip to my system  bus or  using some microcoded emulation mode
of xyz cpu chip.

Subject: Visible Ctrl-P toggle

I have an old disassembly of DRI's 2.2 BDOS.  There are no guarantees that
this is the version you are running, but we can be semi-sure that they are
at least *similar*.

In this version, the Ctrl-P flag byte is at offset 030DH from the start
of the BDOS.  This is *not* the address contained in the BDOS vector
( 05H - 07H ).  The real start of BDOS is at the beginning of the page
pointed to by the vector.  Thus, if your BDOS vector points at 0CC06H,
you can assume that your BDOS actually begins at 0CC00H.  The unused
six bytes are for your serial number.
 
Add 030DH to this value, and you get the location of the flag byte.  In
our case, it's 0CF0DH.

Look around in this area with ZSID as you toggle the printer on and off.
ZSID will pass the Ctrl-P to BDOS.  When you see a byte changing from
zero to non-zero and back, you've got it.  Watch out for the next byte
after the flag byte, though.  It's supposed to be where BDOS keeps its
one buffered character.  If BDOS is buffering, you may see this location
change.  You may make sure of the flag byte by the fact that it will
contain either zero, one, or 0FFH.

Let me know if I can be of any more help.

Subject: various topics

I have been away for awhile but found some topics worth commenting on in the 
last two montsh traffic.  First CP/M+  I got my generic version from S100 
Systems some years ago and even they were suprized that they had it (I ordered 
from a 1 year old catalog) and I doubt that they have it now.  I wish that DR 
would officially disown CP/M+ so that I could give (note GIVE) away copies of 
the generic software (not that manuals though as they are very thick).  I found
one overwhelming reason to chose CPM+ over Z system which was the large TPA 
possible with CPM+ and the smaller TPA available with Z system.  I was haveing 
trouble and did not want to go smaller.  As a supplier of RSX style code 
(Write-Hand-Man in particular) I found the standard interface for such in CPM+ 
to be a dream come true.  Nonstandard CPM2 systems abound..  I recently 
switched to 3.5 inch disks for an odd reason.  Only 3.5 inch disks fit into a 
standard bank safe deposit box.  That did it for me.  Now I have a bunch of 8 
inch and 96TPI 5 inch drives lying around unused.  As to Mice.  Skip all the 
crap and geta RAW MOUSE.  The output of a raw mouse is easy to read on a 
Parrallel input port and very cheap these days.  (many will say that it aint 
easy but if you want a copy of an article that was just about to be published 
in DDJ before they got raped send a SSEE and a buck or so to "Poor Person 
Software, 3721 Starr King Circle, Palo Alto, CA 94306")  This article describes
how to put a quadrature mouse into your BIOS to supply cursor characters as the
mouse moves.  Works with ALL software and is a small BIOS addition.

	Xerox 820 boards had the WD1771 disk controller. Won't do double
density. There are those who have managed to hack the board to do DD, but
it involves a daughter board, doubling the CPU clock, hoping the DRAMs
can run that fast, etc. etc. Quite a project.
	Maybe someday (in my spare time [:>) I might consider tackling this one.
Mine has a pair of double sided 5 1/4" Remex ($29.95 !!!) drives configured

Sorry for the delay in replying - this is my first attempt to mail into the

Subjects: Users > 15 (thanks), SSTAT, BGii screen driver
1) My thanks to those who kindly explained the niceties of high user numbers-
particularly to Jay and Bridger.

2) I recently downloaded SSTAT from simtel20 (file ZSTAT19.LBR I think) and
have experienced a couple of problems with it which I would like to pass on
for others (a) It is said that it will work 'out of the box' BUT this is not
quite true. The initial string which is written to the terminal starts with the
hex sequence 1A 17 04 08. On my system this starts loading a soft screen char
bit pattern! I imagine the 1A is intended to clear the screen, but I am not sure
what the others should do. These can be simply and painlessly patched to some
suitable sequence for your terminal. (b) The mechanism which is used to invoke
the reverse video does not work if the char sequence that is used to select
reverse video contains bytes with the top bit set. This is because there is a
common routine which outputs strings to the screen. On detecting a top bit set,
 calls itself to output the necessary control sequences, which themselves
contain bytes with the top bit set, etc. I leave the rest to you imagination...
So far I have not been able to overcome this problem without simply disabling
this feature, which is a pity as I like the program

For those of you who have tried this program it (for me) has the attraction of
giving both the allocated file size, and the actual file size. I find this a
great help in assessing the benefits to be gained from using libraries - my
hard disk has a 16K allocation unit!

3) BGii screen driver. I am in the final stages of testing a screen driver for
a British machine (Acorn BBC + Z80 co-processor). I doubt if there will be
much interest in such a screen driver, but I can make it available to anyone
who would like it. It has been derived from the H19 screen driver which came
with my copy of BGii. For those who understand this machine, the driver currentl
only works in mode 3 (80x25) not mode 0 (80x32). It is able to save  and retore
the colours, TERM state and (surprise, surprise) any use of reverse video.

Subject: CP/M Emulator...

Bill:
	There is a PD CP/M 2.2 emulator that runs under CP/M-68K.  It is
on Simtel20.ARPA as COM.LBR PD1:<CPM.CPM68K>.  The .LBR file is a LU310
compatable library file and contains squeezed (USQ210) sources files, in
68000 assembler.  This emulator runs under CP/M-68K and has a "dummy"
BIOS/BDOS, which just transfer control to the CP/M-68K BIOS/BDOS.  Does
not have a CCP - run one CP/M 2.2 program and returns to CP/M-68K's CCP
(i.e. piggybacks on CP/M-68K's CCP).  Under UNIX, I guess you'll have to
write a "real" BIOS/BDOS which fake it and call UNIX system functions.  This
emulator is mainly an 8080 emulator - does not fully emulate the Z80, although
hooks are there.  Speed:  about 1Mhz 8080 on a 10Mhz 68000.
	Simtel20.ARPA supports anonymous FTP on ARPANet.  I don't know if
this helps any.

A while back I disassembled and analyzed CPM60.COM for CP/M 2.23 on my
Apple II, and this is the memory map that it appears to use:

      CPM60.COM address            memory address
      -----------------            --------------
 BIOS 500h - AFFh                  B000h - B5FFh (in Language Card Bank #2)
 CCP  F00h - 17FFh                 D300h - DBFFh
 BDOS 1800h - 1BFFh                DC00h - DFFFh
 BDOS 1C00h - 26FFh                B5C0h - BFBFh (in Language Card Bank #2)
 BIOS 2700h - 2CFFh                FA00h - FFFFh

Since the Apple only has contiguous memory from 0000h - DFFFh, it is
necessary to split the BDOS into two parts; one is in high memory at
DC00-DFFFh, where you would expect it to be, but the other half is
in bank-switched memory, accessible only if the appropriate bank-switching
routines are inserted into the DC00-DFFFh section of the BDOS.
Likewise, the BIOS is split in two pieces in memory.

I don't think there is any easy way of installing a different BDOS
without very extensive modification/customization for the memory
configuration that Apple uses.

By the way, someone reminded me that this 'warped' implementation of
CP/M is not Apple's fault, as I had implied in a previous posting.
It was developed for them by Microsoft for the Softcard.
(Hmmm.... aren't they one of Digital Research's competitors, anyway? :-) )

If anyone knows how to force M80/L80 to make a .hex file with an origin
at a location other than 100H without zero-filling all the space between
100H and the requested origin, I sure would like to KNOW. I am aware of
all the switches in both M80 and L80. I sure can't find the magic combination.
Perhaps I have an incorrect use of one of the pseudo ops (ASEG, ORG and
so on). Please include your pseudo ops in your answer.

The image in memory that is to receive the new BDOS patch is the reserve
track image from the boot floppy. This reserve track image contains more
than just a copy of the operating system. There is also a cold start loader,
perhaps a sign-on message, maybe even a default command to be executed
the first time the CCP is given control. It is the reserve track image
that must be patched and that presents a problem. CPM standards do not
exist for the reserve track format. The best I can do is to provide a tool
in the event the BDOS image is contiguous on the reserve track(s). I
might note that it is even presumptuous to assume that I can read the
reserve tracks using standard BDOS calls. Quite often the skew factor
on the reserve tracks are different than the standard tracks to
optimize warm boots. (That was my problem with the Northstar, for those of
you who have been patiently following this discussion.)

He just got an 820-1 with two 8-inch drives, but it doesn't seem to be
able to format or use double density disks.  He didn't get an 820 docs,
he found a format program, but it erased the wrong disk.  Any ideas on the
disk formats and format programs?

Several years ago an outfit in Berkeley had just such a product (I think they
supprted VMS, I know they had bsd4.1). My former employer bought it and we 
used it. They had two versions, a s-l-o-w software simulator, and a plug-in
board with 4 Z80 machines that was merely slow (by the standards of my Alspa).

I just found a card for them: (warning, may be out of date)

	What's an easy way to figure out what amount of TPA is required
	to run a '.COM' file ?  I have friends with Genevas and Starlets
	who would like to get CP/M software from me, but I understand
	thoses boxes have limited TPAs in which to play.

I'll say you have a problem!  Simply put, the generic 820-I does *not* read
or write double density.  However, there are some after-market add-on cards
that support it.  Two I know of are: SWP double-density card from somewhere
in Texas that supports EITHER 5.25 or 8" with no mods to your system; Emerald
Microware Plus2 double-density which supports 8" and 5.25, but requires some
mods to the board.

Emerald also has operating systems, BIOSes, formatters, and sysgens for the
820, but I do not know current prices for any of this stuff.

If you need a number to either of these places, let me know.  I can scare
them up since I have both the SWP and Plus2 package.  Single density is just
no fun anymore! :-)

Subject: Determining TPA Requirements of Programs

Richard Secrist asked about determining the amount of TPA that a program
needs.  There is no way in principle to do this.  Well written programs
test to make sure they have enough room and abort with a suitable message
if they don't.  On the other hand, there probably are not very many well
written programs (I certainly have not written too many of them!).
 
An experimental approach would involve zeroing out the TPA memory (for
example, with DDT), then running the program, and finally examining
memory to see what data got written where.  Under Z System it is easy
to examine memory without using any (with the RCP peek command), but there
is undoubtedly some way to do this under CP/M as well.

True.  The clock rate is fine for double density.

Whoa!  The 1771 does not perform MFM encoding/decoding so how can you get
double density?  Double sided is trivial but MFM requires a different
controller chip.  The 1793 is very close pin wise to the 1771 and handles
MFM but it requires extra components to set certain timing parameters.  I
believe the add-on card from Emerald Systems uses this chip.

I really would be interested in how a 1771 can be made to handle double
density.

The step rate is not related to head settling time.  The step rate is the
time difference between step pulses sent out by the controller.  Some
floppys can take step rates down in the microsecond range (buffered seeks).
The drive specifications determine the minimum allowable step rate.

The settling time is the amount of time the head takes to stabilize after
a seek or series of seeks.  You only to need to wait for the heads to
settle after the last seek before performing the read or write operation
so changing this parameter does not cause significant changes in
performance.  Especially considering that rotational delays are around
100ms average (300rpm) and head settling times are around 15ms.

Not quite true.  The Xerox 820 runs at 2.5 MHz which is more than adequate
for 5.25" double-density.  Although it does not quite hack it for a *generic*
8" DD disk driver, the SWP package I mentioned earlier supports 8" DSDD at
2.5 MHz by clever programming.  The SWP package requires absolutely *no*
modifications to the Xerox 820-I - although I do recommend a modification to
increase delay for the head settling time (after seek).  This allows a high
step rate; I run all my 8" drives at 3 mS on the -I.

Subject: Xerox 820-1 and Double Density

In response to some Xerox 820-1 questions on the net recently
(young@ee.ecn.purdue.edu and leftlane!leadfoot@sun.com), as has
already been pointed out, the Xerox 820-1 uses a WD 1771 controller
chip that *only* does single-density disk I/O.

I am a Xerox user (sometimes), and until now I relied on SSSD 8"
drives for my Xerox.  But again, as has already been pointed out,
single-density is no fun!  I'm in the process of doing the
Emerald Microware upgrade on one of my Xerox's.  The 5 MHz mod
was no big deal.  I put an 'A' cpu in the board, and went to
faster EPROM's for the monitor (2716-1 is a must).  The monitor
software has to be patched because it uses the CTC to generate
regular interrupts, and they are used in turn to time disk
access, etc.

The Emerald add-on board uses a WD 1793 chip, and that (in
combination with their Xpro EPROM set) lets one write several
popular double density formats.  The 5 1/4" Kaypro seems to be
the most useful.  I've got the board built and stuck on the
Xerox.  It's up and running at 5 MHz in monitor mode.  Now I've
got to calibrate it, and make up some CP/M disks that are
boot-able on the new hardware.  The Emerald upgrade requires
semi-major mods. to the 820 board.  I avoided most of the
trace cuts by installing sockets under about 5 chips so that
I can "cut" runs by removing chip pins from the socket.  That
leaves the option of going back if I don't like this whole thing.

Emerald is selling the DD-mod. bare boards for $15, or 2 for
$25, right now as a close-out.  Pity I can't give more info. about
how it all works(yet).  Somebody told me that it is slow to boot from
8" drives because it tries several different formats to determine
what kind of hardware is out there -- 5" formats first.  Since
I'd like to run from Tandon 5" drives, I hope that won't be a
problem.  BTW, one doesn't have to do the 5MHz upgrade *except*
for 8" DD.  Apparently, the 2.5 MHz cpu just can't keep up with
8" DD transfer rates.

If anyone is interested in this upgrade, I can keep you posted
about how it works (if it works!).
