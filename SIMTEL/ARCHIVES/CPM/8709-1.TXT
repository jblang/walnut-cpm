Subject: Life, adventure, and 68000 S100's

  Sort of sounds like a Douglas Adams book, doesn't it?  Well, sort of.

  There are a couple of programs which I am sure are available for CP/M, but
haven't seen around anywhere.  Does anybody know of a good version of LIFE?
I'll probably want to adapt it to run on my IMSAI VIO memory-mapped video
board, but that's ok. 

  I don't play computer games much, personally, (a matter of definition,
actually :-) but I have some friends who quite enjoy Adventure.  I understand
that there's an expanded version of the original.  Let's see, how to phrase it
delicately but succinctly: Where? 

  Oh, by the way, I don't have FTP access to anything not connected to our
etherent LAN. So much for Arpanet.

  Has anybody upgraded a Z80 S100 machine to a 68000 and lived to tell about
it?  The idea intrigues me.  I have visions of running a multi-tasking OS like
MINIX or OS9/68K or something.  Suggestions, anyone?  I should be most
interested. 

  I ordered my upgrade to Wordstar 4.0 yesterday. I'm so excited...

If you have, please let me know! Many thanks. I have ADL (Adventure Definition

Subject: S100 68000 hardware


Ken asks about S100 68000 cards.

The normal recommendation is the Compupro CP68K card.  It works with
all the other Compupro boards, but it is also compatible with standard
S100 stuff from anyone else.  The board does (or did) come with
CP/M-68K.  If it doesn't, you can get CP/M-68K from TriSoft (generic
version), or already customised from Gifford (if they still market
it).  It should not be hard to port most any other system to the

board.

I have seen the Compupro board for under $200.  Check with the ads in
the latest issues of Dr Dobbs and Micro/System Journal.

Subject: Wordstar 4.0 for CP/M.

I have for several days tried to get through on the technical phone line to
Micropro to enquire about Wordstar 4.0 for CP/M on the Apple ][ Applicard. As
this line always seems to be busy, I am wondering whether someone on the net
can answer my question.  Does anyone know what version of CP/M 4.0 should be
used with the Applicard.  Is it the "Apple" version, due for release in 
October, or is this just for the Softcard ?  Previous Apple versions of WS
would not work with the Applicard, unless specifically purchased as such 
(or patched).  The answer from the sales part of Micropro was that the Apple
version was the same for both Softcard and Applicard.  THis may be quite 
possible, but I would like to confirm.  I can use 8" disks on my Apple, but
Micropro sales that the generic WS 4.0 on 8" would not be suitable for the 
Applicard.  I find this to be strange, as I have never yet found a piece of
generic CP/M software which would not run on the Applicard (because of the
Applicard itself).  Has anyone obtained any reliable information on this 
subject from Micropro ?

Subject: New files uploaded to SIMTEL20 during August

The following is a complete list of CP/M-oriented files uploaded to
SIMTEL20 during the month of August, 1987.  The numbers following
the filenames are the file size in bytes followed by the file format.
(7) means ASCII, (8) means binary.

For a complete list of all CP/M files, see:
   PD:<CPM>CPM.CRCLST - Complete list with CRC values
   PD:<CPM>CPM.ARC    - The above, ARChived (much smaller), binary(8).
   PD:<CPM>FILES.DIR  - Abbreviated list with only directory and file names
   PD:<CPM>FILES.IDX  - Similar to below, no descriptions, comma delimited

There is currently no complete listing of all files, with descriptions.
That is in the process of being created and will be announced when
available.  In the meantime, see PD:<CPM.FILEDOCS>CPMAUG01.LST (ascii)
or CPMAUG01.LZT (crunched) which is a complete listing of all CP/M
files on GEnie, each with a one-line description.  Since SIMTEL20 and
GEnie have many of the same files, this will be a very useful listing.
It is updated monthly.

Note: to save space in the following listing, the device name PD: which
normally appears ahead of the directory name has been omitted.

I have a friend who has a C128 and wishes
to use his modem with it.  He has the
2.2 patch to run 2.2 software, all he needs now is
the programs to use.  I know MEX has a patch available for it
and is on SIMTEL20, but the files
are not on the BITNET server (which is the only one
which I can use I think).  Can some
kind soul please send me some comm program for the C128 in CPM mode
preferably 2.2.  MEX would be nice.  But beggers can't be
choosers.

Thank for all your help and assistance.
P.S.  I cannot see what I am typing on this

  Thanks, Margaret. I'm replying to the net because it seems to me that I miss
a lot due to people sending direct all the time. It's not as if this list is
overly busy. 

  One thing I'm curious about: I talked to a Cromemco guy once who said that
their 68000 boards are not really compatible with IEE-696. Would you have any
idea if that's true, and whether much is required for mods? I think he said
they require 16-bit memory access. It seems to me IEE-696 says it's optional.
All my boards are 8-bit only. Doesn't sound like a minor difference to me :-). 

  BTW, I never did hear anything positive regarding LIFE or or the newer
ADVENTURE.

Micro/Systems Journal is, indeed, a good place to look.  I bought a self
contained 68008 coprocessor from Peak Electronics in San Jose for around
$900 which included CP/M-68K, the BIOS and monitor sources (Aztec C),
512K RAM, two serial ports and a couple of timers.  The board has bus
rights on the S-100 bus so it can use existing peripherals.

Another interesting feature about the Peak board is how they implemented
CP/M-68K.  They presume that you are running CP/M-80 or CP/M-86 and they
provide a 68K boot program for each.  There's a small interface program
that lets the 68K use the existing BIOS for all of its physical I/O so
the setup is effortless.  When you are through with the 68K you just
execute the RETURN program and you are back where you came from.  This is
particularly useful if you have your favorite editors, etc. whereas
CP/M-68K only comes with ED.

You can get a Godbout board a lot cheaper but you'll have a lot more work
to get it going.  It's a full up 68000 so you don't have the 1Mb limit
of the 68008 but it's not a coprocessor so you will have to interface all
of your peripherals again.  The DRI assembler and C compiler are adequate
(their C is bulky and slow) but I shudder to think of using them to do
a BIOS from scratch.

  Interesting. I jut started getting MSJ. I'll check it out. But what
does "bus rights" mean? Is there an interface? An S100 slot?

  And I'm beginning to wonder what's so special about CP/M-68K. As far
as I can see, it's not compatible with all my CP/M-80 stuff... what do
you use it for?

munch...

	It may interest several people that there is a Z80 mnemonic
Small-C compiler complete with assembler and linker. I got the package
somewhere a few years ago and it's all public domain. There seems to be
massive confusion over the versions available and the machines destined
for the compiler. This is Small_C Version 1.2 destined for the Z80 and
creates a file soley for a Z80 assembler and linker, which as I said
earlier, are included. By the time this gets posted Tom Armistead should
have his copy with explicit instructions on what to do with it. 
	This package also contains floating point routines explicitly for
the Z80 and works very well, especially since it has transcendentals. For
those that like walkback traces, it also includes a profiler.
	
	Now, it would seem to me that since I have written this note,
there must indeed exist a Z80 only Small-C package. Soooo, please stop
telling people it doesn't exist! It does!! I use it!!! In CP/M!!!!

	Now that I have said that, would someone, anybody, please tell
me how to get this package to the net? My only alternative right now is to 
upload it to the Royal Oaks BBS and let Keith handle it IF he wants to. How
about you people letting me know how to get it to the net by E-mailing
instructions via ihnp4!whuts!wsd or maybe some other convenient way. I will
E-mail it to anybody who promises to upload it to the net. In case your
wondering, it will fit on one 360K floppy disk.

To: info-cpm@simtel20.arpa

Now that I finally have ZCPR3.3 installed on my Apple, I have a few questions
that I just cannot seem to find the answers to.  Anyone care to help?

  1).  Just what does an ECP do?  ARUNZ seems to be the choice, but I
       don't know why.  Is there any doc for ARUNZ floating about?

  2).  Is there any documentation for the utilities?  I have ZCPR3, The
       Manual, but it doesn't talk about any of the new ones.  The .LBR
       files contain only update information (ARUNZ is a case in point).

  3).  Is there any summary of what all the various Z system utilities
       do.  As a novice to the Z world, I constantly see things like 
       "a new version of ASDF has been released".  It would be nice to
       be able to look at a list and see a one line description of ASDF.

Thanks in advance for your trouble.

Joe.

I would like to run the ZCPR3 system on my Bondwell 2 computer

ZCPR3 going? What is the difference between ZCPR2 and ZCPR3?
Is ZCPR3 better, and ZCPR33 even better?

For anyone that is interested, I can make available the ADL package for CP/M
2.2.  It is written in BDS C version 1.50a, and binaries can be made available.

Any interest?

Tim has brought up an interesting point.

Ross Cunniff and I developed ADL together.  Ross created the (hopefully)
portable version, written in generic C.  I created a completely independent
version -- with the same functionality -- for CP/M 2.2, written in BDS C
version 1.50a.  If there is interest, I am willing to make available the
source and/or binaries of my version of ADL.

Write me.  If there is enough interest, I may look into some sort of larger
distribution, otherwise e-mail will have to do.

  It's already in the SIG/M library (don't remember which volume - I can check

Does anybody out there have any experience with the CP/M bdos calls
Search for First and Search for Next?
I am working on a program that needs to read every file off of a cp/m disk.
I set the file name in the FCB to ????????.???.
Search for First is called, and returns with the FCB pointing to the first
file on the disk.
The first file is opened, read, and closed successfully.
Search for Next returns with file not found.  (There are more files).
If I set the FCB to ????????.??? before doing the Search for Next, The
function returns with the first file again.
It seems like I am doing something wrong with the FCB.

Any Suggesstions?

I am sure there are thousands of others out there who can answer this one.
(Right, Bridger?)  Essentially, the problem is that whenever you do a
file operation such as Search, Open, or Close, the DOS goes off plucking
through your directory.  Hence, a Search must be followed by a Search for
Next if you want "more of the same".  Any Opens, Closes, Deletes, etc. destroy
the flow of things and you must start over.

Internally, there is a Search for Next directory counter which
keeps track of where the last Search was done AS WELL AS the address of the
FCB used for Search.  (Hence, the little known fact that Search for Next does
not require ANY FCB to be specified - it uses the FCB address from the
previous operation.)  Both the counter and the FCB addr are reset if any
other file operation is attempted (there are some exceptions).

Hope this helps.

CP/M-68K is just another O/S.  It *IS* somewhat compatable with CP/M 2.2 in
that the file system is the same and O/S (i.e. BDOS/BIOS) are compatable
(same function codes, simular data-structures - an FCB is an FCB).  True,
at the assembly language level things are not compatable, nor are executable
files, that is .COM files from CP/M 2.2 won't run under CP/M-68K, nor will .68K
files run under CP/M 2.2, however, if you have a dual CPU system, it makes
sense.  This not really new:  there are a varity of CP/M-80/86 system around
(CompuPro/Viasan makes one, the old DEC Rainbow 100 is another).  

On a related issue:  Mince does exist for CP/M-68K.  Mark Of The Unicorn may
not admit its existance (just like DRI may not admit the existance of
CP/M-68K, or even the existance of the 68000 :_)).  I have Mince for
CP/M-68K (really).  I also have a PD 8080 (CP/M 2.2) emulator for CP/M-68K.
It is not super fast (runs 8080 programs at about a 2Mhz equivelant clock
speed on a 10Mhz 68000), but works.  I use it mostly for an UNARC program
(nope, there is not ARC for CP/M-68K). 

If you are interested in CP/M-68K software, I have written/adapted quite a
pile of it. Including a LU program, extended directory program, extensions
to Mince, FidoNet, a BBS program (adapted from UNaXcess), XModem, Kermit,
(both XModem and Kermit are Stride 400 series dependent, but can be hacked
for your serial ports), and much else. Some of it is on Simtel20, GEnie,
BIX, a little on CompuServe, and most is available for downloading on my BBS
(Locks Hill BBS, FidoNet 321/148, 617-544-6933, 7:30PM to 8:00AM Eastern

It is perfectly reasonable for a CPU card to require 16-bit memory.
There is a range of valid combinations in most IEEE (count the E's) bus
architectures, including 696 (S100), 797 (Multibus), etc. They have
specifications for it, I forget the details but it's something like
M16, A24 (meaning you do 16-bit memory accesses, and support 24-bit
addressing).

The DUAL Systems' 68000 board (which I have used since 1984 and am
still happy with despite the fact that it's not a 68020 :-) ) also
requires 16-bit memories. If you want reasonable performance that is
one end of a price/performance tradeoff; if you want compatibility back
through all the ages (or at least to 1975), that is quite another.
CompuPro, having sold a LOT of 8-bit memory boards, presumably felt
that compatibility was more important.

As far as "mods", if you mean modifying your 8-bit memory boards to
work in 16-bit mode, I hope you aren't serious. When you can buy a
megabyte of 16-bit ram for $500? How much is your time worth? At
a dollar an hour, you're probably still better off going for a new
board. See the ads in Micro/Systems Journal or Computer Shopper.

The way Serch For First/Search For Next are intended to be used is:
1.) seed an FCB with ????????.??? and call Seacrh For Next
2.) while it finds one:
    Copy the name into a second FCB and process the file.
3.) Call Search For Next using the FCB the previous Search call returned.
It is not correct to use the same FCB for search, then immediatey use it 
for Open, Read, Close, then expect it to continue the search.

According to "Inside CP/M" by David E. Cortesi, there should be no
file operations intervening the Search for First and Search for Next,
or intervening successive Search for Next operations, in some implementa-
ations of CP/M.  This may cause the BDOS do lose its place in the
directory.  (See p. 476 of the above text.)

Bus rights means that the 68008 has access to everything on the bus,
memory and I/O.  The S-100 memory is accessed in pages that are set up
with a parallel port that is private to the 68K.  Also note that the
68008 had an 8 bit data bus and can only address 1Mb of memory.  That
limitation was not made by the board designer it's in the chip.  The
Godbout/CompuPro/Viasyn board is a real 68000, the aircraft carrier style
chip, the 68008 is in a 48 pin(?) DIP.  The CompuPro doesn't have any
on-board memory or peripherals so it's pretty hard to turn it on and off.

Au contraire, the way the CP/M-68K BIOS is written you start it from CP/M-80
and it uses your CP/M-80 files (same goes for CP/M-86 and CP/M-816, the way
I use it) and BIOS.  That means that you are in the air in the time it takes
to type "CPM68K".  More importantly you can use all of your favorite stuff
(like an editor!) to compose stuff for CP/M-68K and then fire up the 68K to
run the C compiler and utilities.  I use it for "cross development", the
quotes mean that the target machine isn't emulated, it's really there.  I
have a dual processor (8085/8088) that runs CP/M-816 (80 and 86 transparently)
and when I need to run something for the 68K, I use the Peak board.  There
are a number of applications, print buffer, comm front end...  It's kind of
an expensive print buffer, but I got it because it was the least expensive
way I could tiptoe into the 68K world keeping my investment in S-100 assets
and development tools.

Subject: MINCE for CP/M-68K



Does Mark of the Unicorn really not admit it exists?  Sounds like one
of Reagan's speeches {:-)

TriSoft used to sell MINCE for the CP/M-68K system (although I do not
know if they have any copies in current inventory).  Likewise,
CompuView also has VEDIT for the CP/M-68K system (and probably will
also not admit its existence).  Since most everything I run is dual
processor, I drop back into other systems if I want a full screen
editor.  There are several software emulators (which let you run the
CP/M-2.2 software), but that suffers from speed loss.

For myself, I *LIKE* ED!

in a review in the latest Profiles, the author stated that it loaded in the

	I'm posting for a friend. But hi!

	Does anyone have CP/M for a Morrow Designs Micro Decision? It needs a 
Morrow CP/M disk to boot up. If anyone does have one, is there a way to get 
one nowadays? Morrow folded, I think. And it can't boot off any other CP/M 
we've tried yet.

	The cause is a good one. A friend of ours left her job, and she left 
her access to a modem with it. The Morrow would make a nice telecomputer for 
her, and maybe get her news access. . .

  Actually, no, I wasn't serious. But do you know where I can get
$500? I buy (scrounge) my S100 boards for <$50 apiece from people who
have them sitting around and are glad to get _anything_ for them.
THAT'S hobbyist prices. It's like the man who wished he could afford
an elephant. He didn't really want an elephant; he just wished he
could afford one :-). Is it really nothing special for the average
hobbyist to spend $500 or so on a new board? I guess what I'm
wondering is, how many of the people who read this list are purely
hobbyists in regards to CP/M, as apposed to being able to justify
their expenditures business-wise? Businesses can't afford the time a
hobbyist can spend.

  I've downloaded 3 different Public Domain BDOSes from the new
archive-server.  SUPERBDOS looks nice, especially the disk relogging
features. It's based on P2DOS. However, I also got DOS+, which has DU:
directory support, wheel byte, and a bunch of stuff like that.

  Does anybody have any experience with these, and how they compare to
ZRDOS?

For clarification, it is ADL not DDL which I have been working on.
Basically, we (Ross Cunniff and I) started with DDL, "cleaned up and
modernized" the syntax, added features, etc.  The major differences between
ADL and DDL are:

	1.  ADL syntax differs from DDL for conditional and looping constructs.

	2.  ADL introduces the concept of Actors.

	3.  Extensive work has gone into creating a "Zork-like" parser for
	    player input.

Scenarios written in DDL translate easily to ADL, but not vice versa.  In fact,
two of the sample scenarios that come with the package (AARD and MPU) were
originally written in DDL.

I want to acknowledge the great debt that ADL owes to the creators of DDL:
Bruce Adler, Chris Kostanick, Michael Stein, Michael Urban, and Warren Usui,
then members of the UCLA Computer Club.

 I don't know that I'm an 'average hobbyist', but with a few exceptions,
all of the boards in my system cost multiple hundreds of dollars.  My
boards range from a memory mapped video board (many thanks to the net for
the help in figgereing out how to make it work!) that I got for $10 at
a hamfest to an $1130 Macrotech ADIT board (16 serial ports, DMA, onboard
intelligence, probably the most frustrating purchase I ever made, and I'm
still fighting with Macrotech to try to get them to fix the firmware!).
I have found that Compupro (with the exception of the SPUZ) makes quite
nice hardware, though you do have to pay quite a bit, and you are pretty
much on your own for software (in the CP/M world anyway).  However, you
get what you pay for, and I wouldn't have been able to build the system
I have today (or learn as much as I have building it) unless I was
willing to shell out the cash for the hardware.  That's what credit
cards are for, right?  :+) 
 However, there's no business involved, so since it's just for my own
personal enjoyment, I guess I do qualify as a hobbyist.

Message-Id: <330@gaia.UUCP>
Sender: info-cpm-request@simtel20.arpa
To: info-cpm@simtel20.arpa

Thanks to all of the responses to my first question about the
BDOS Search for First and Search for Next commands.  Most of the
messages I received said that it is necessary to do the Search
Next calls immediately after the Search First, and to save the
filenames and/or FCBs in a buffer before doing any file operations.

I have changed my code and seem to be back to square one.
The procedure I am using is now as follows:

Zero the lower FCB bytes and the CR byte in the FCB (as per cp/m manuals).
Fill the name and extension fields with ???????? and ???   .
Call Search for First with DE pointing to the FCB.
Call Search for Next. (This doesn't help or hurt.)
Call a routine which copies the FCB to another buffer NEWFCB.
Open, Read, and Close the first file using NEWFCB, FCB is not altered.
Call Search for Next. (I tried pointing DE to the FCB, no change.)

The results: The search first returns with the first filename and the file
is read out with no problems.  The search next returns with the first filename
and the read bombs out with an immediate EOF.  The search for first and next
both return without errors (match found).

Am I missing somthing very obvious?

Thanks in advance,

Yes.

I've seen at least four replies go by that all said:

Zero the lower FCB bytes and the CR byte in the FCB (as per cp/m manuals).
Fill the name and extension fields with ???????? and ???   .
Call Search for First
Call a routine which appends the FCB to a list of FCBs

While Search for Next returns OK, DO BEGIN
  Call a routine which appends the FCB to a list of FCBs
END

When the entire list of names is built, go back, and one at a time,
open, read, process, close.

Subject: Help! Problems installing AE Z-card w/ Sider
Message-Id: <3829@ihlpg.ATT.COM>
Sender: info-cpm-request@simtel20.arpa
To: info-cpm@simtel20.arpa


I recently purchased the Applied Engineering Z-card for my Apple ][+ 
w/ Sider as a replacement for my Microsoft look-alike which did not 
support the Sider.  AE claims the Z-card works w/ the Sider.

I'm looking for anyone who may have encountered this problem before.  
I need to know how to get around it - AE appears incapable or 
unwilling to provide support.  

Symptoms:
I follow the installation instructions (to the letter, or any number 
of variations) but it still fails.  The place it fails is during the 
APATCH12 program, shortly after it asks for a one liner to be executed 
on start up.  The instructions indicate that the APATCH12 program is 
supposed to give a message like "PRESS RETURN TO REBOOT" and then 
everything is hunky-dory.  I never get that message, and what's even 
stranger, the APATCH12 program is accessing the floppy drive and never 
touches the Sider.  I would have expected it to write some changes on 
the Sider at some point.  

(Note: the Sider works - it has DOS, ProDos and UCSD up and running).

Needless to say, my AE card isn't doing me much good.  I've contacted 
AE seven times - five phone calls and two letters over a two month 
period.  At one point they were able to duplicate the problem over the 
phone and agreed that some of the APATCH12 programs were flaky and I 
should send them my disk for a replacement, so I did.  Now they have 
changed their mind, saying that they cannot reproduce the problem that 
they already demonstrated(!).  No indication as to when a solution or 
a replacement disk would be forthcoming, and all this while my 
warranty is tick-tick-ticking away, and I'm not even able to use the 
Z-card.  Bloody terrific.  

If anyone has a similar configuration and knows a work-around, I would 
be ever grateful.  If anyone knows some magic for getting AE to 
respond to letters, that would be almost as good.  

Regards,
Tim Born

I probably shouldn't consider myself "the average hobbyist", but $500 is
an EXCEPTIONAL amount to pay for an S-100 card.  I once bought a 32K
memory card new for about $350 (4k x 1 statics), and that almost broke
the bank.  Since then I picked up a set of 3 Cromemco cards (Z80, 64k
and 16 FDC) for $80, and added a new TUART for another $99.  Now that's
more my speed!  These are true hobby systems.  There's lots of hardware
out there that's tempting, but life is too short to be in debt to it.
BTW, I believe that this is where most vendors go wrong.  If it's good,
AND AFFORDABLE, they can sell all they want to.  If one looks at the
harware success stories of the last ten or fifteen years, this is the
common pattern.  When a 68000-based computer falls into this category,
I'll be first in line.

Your main problem is still trying to do File I/O while in the midst of 
the search.  You need to *complete* searching for *all* files, *then* do
your File I/O.  The following C code should clarify things (I don't use
assembly, and am not really up on 8080/Z80 assembler (my system is a
68000 and I run CP/M-68K, which works much like CP/M 2.2):

 /* FCB structure */

typedef struct {
    char drive;		/* drive code */
    char fname[8];	/* file name */
    char ftype[3];	/* file type */
    char unused[21];	/* filler (32-byte FCB) */
    } FCB;

 /* result FCBs will end up in the DMA buffer, which is treated like
    an array of 4 FCBs */

static FCB seabuf[4];

 /* input FCB */

static FCB infcb;

 /* the function __BDOS calls bdos.  takes two args: a function code
    and a parameter.   (CP/M-68K passes the function code in D0 and a long
    word (32-bits) in D1 as the parameter.)
    */

extern int __BDOS();

/* linked list of FCBs - list of names found */

typedef struct flist {
    FCB file;
    struct flist *next;
    } FLIST;

/* memory allocator */

char *malloc();

/* search function */

FLIST *find_all_files()
{
    register FLIST *result,*new;	/* name list pointers */
    register int   status;		/* status code
    register int   i,j;			/* some lose ints */
    register char *p,*q;		/* char (byte) pointers */

    infcb.drive = 0;			/* current drive */
    for (p=infcb.fname,i=0; i < 8; i++, p++) *p = '?'; fill in filename
    for (p=infcb.ftype,i=0; i < 3; i++, p++) *p = '?'; fill in filetype
    for (p=infcb.unused,i=0; i < 21; i++, p++) *p = '\0'; fill in rest of FCB

    __BDOS(SETDMA,&seabuf);		/* set DMA address to result buffer */

    result = 0L;			/* null pointer */

    status = __BDOS(SEARCHFIRST,&infcb); /* start off search */

    while (status != 0x00FF) {		/* found a file? */
	new = (FLIST *) malloc(sizeof(FLIST)); /* allocate some memory */
	if (new == 0L) {		/* memory allocate error */
	    perror("find_all_files (malloc)");
	    abort(0);
	    }
        /* copy found FCB over */
	for (p = &seabuf[0], q = new->file, i=0; i < sizeof(FCB); p++,q++,i++)
	    *q = *p;
	/* add to front of list */
	new->next = result;
	result = new;
	status = __BDOS(SEARCHNEXT,0L); /* search again */
	} /* end of while loop */

    return(result);      /* return pointer to list of file names. */
			 /* note that the list is in reverse order.  One of
			    features of using a linked list structure with
			    prepending in an interative loop.  I am assuming
			    that the order does not really matter. If it does,
			    then the result accumulating code should be
			    */
    }


The above function will generate a list of all files on the current drive.
I used symbolic names for the function codes (don't have my CP/M manuals
here at work) and assume long word pointers (CP/M-68K).  The important thing
is this:  you need to find ALL of the filenames BEFORE doing ANY file I/O.
All bets are off if you use OPEN, CLOSE, DELETE, MAKE, RENAME, READ, WRITE,
READRANDOM, WRITERANDOM, etc. while in the midst of a search first/search 
next cycle.  The DIR command has an easy job:  it just does console I/O
between searches.  STAT and PIP, must acclumulate some sort of name list
and then loop down this list.  Note, if you don't want to mess with
allocating memory and linked lists, you can simply set assign a name
only buffer and copy the filenames from the search buffer, using some
sort of separater character (i.e. a null character), using a name counter
and a working pointer.

Tim,

I can't help with your problem, but I can ease your mind a little.  Once you
have applied for warranty service, your warranty coverage for that specific
problem is frozen in time until the problem is resolved.  That means that AE
is bound to get you up and running, no matter how long it takes.  Don't let
them give you any crap about warranty expiration.

Good luck,

You might want to check out the 68K project in the current Radio Electronics
Magazine.  $200 for "usable" 8Mhz system kit; $500 with floppy subsys, 1Mb
memory, SK/DOS, etc.  Has Itty Bitty Machine PC bus interface to use clone 
controllers for Hard Disk, extra i/o ports (board design includes 2 serial,
1 parallel), bit-map video, etc.  I'm ordering one.		[dale]

The problem, as far as I can see, is that the BDOS has internal variables,
distinct from the FCB, which are maintained in between the Search for First
call and the Search for Next call, and in between successive Search for Next
calls.  Calls to other file functions overwrite those variables.  Therefore
the sequence of calls that you are using fails, since your program has no way
of saving and restoring those variables -- only BDOS knows where they are
stored.

The most obvious, but not a very efficient, way of doing what you want to
do is to maintain a count of which directory entry you are at.  Each time
you finish dumping a file, increment that count, then call Search for First,
and then call Search for Next the number of times specified by count minus
one.  (The initial value for count should be one.)  Don't forget to reject
(and not count) entries that are not the first extension, or else a part
of a file will be mistaken for a complete one.

If I think of a more efficient way, then I'll post it.

Subject: Osborne System Disk..


HELP!!!

   It seems that one of my friends was doing some consulting work for a
firm that owns an Osborne computer.  OK, so what is the problem?

   The problem is that while my friend was on vacation the business
accidentally reformated the system disk.  Still no problem...

   Well, as it turns out the company forgot to mention that that copy
of the system disk was the only copy, the orginal disks that came with
the Osborne I were lost in a recent move.

   Now that is a problem, they still have a couple of bootable disks,
but no longer have such nices things as FORMAT, PIP, STAT, etc...
Can anybody help me out here...  I can probably supply them with
the more generic programs from my CPM library for my Heath, but I'm
afraid there is no way I can come up with FORMAT.  

   I will be more than willing to send someone a disk and mailer, if
someone could copy the stuff onto it and return it I would be very
happy.  I could probably come up with proof of ownership for the machine
if anyone wanted to see it.

Thanks,

Does anyone know where I can get some reasonably priced (free?) documentation
on the Epson QX10?  Basically, I need things like port addresses, etc. Technical
stuff.

While were at it, does anyone know how to write directly to the video?  Is
it memory mapped (and if so, what are the addresses), or do I write to
a port or what? 


Thanks in advance.

Has anyone attempted to write a custom CCP for CP/M 3.0?  The idea of writing 
such a beast in some language other than ASM is tempting.  However, the thought
of dissecting the LOADER from the existing CCP and learning how to get it as 
part of the new CCP and loaded into memory as an RSX is a bit daunting.  Has 
anyone done anything along this line?  I know it is a  bit late for CP/M 3.0 
but I have run out of things to do on CP/M 2.0 and am resisting buying one of 
these new machines where you can't fiddle with the BIOS (in ROM).  What is a 
home computer for if you cn't program it?  So I am converting to CP/M 3.0 
instead.  I would try Turbodos but the supplier is very closed lipped about 
source and my copy for the NorthStar has no BIOS source.  Starting from scratch
there is a bit daunting as well.  Peace

Yes, Alan, there's at least one:

CCP105 is a good implementation of ZCPR2.  It's on simtel20.arpa.

I'm actively working on a ZCPR33 port; it's too early to project a

  Right on! However, there's a lot of stuff coming out for 2.2 still, what with
ZCPR3.3 and all. It seems to me that the BDOS could use some work. I've down-
loaded 3 PD versions: DOS+, P2DOS, and SUPRBDOS. They all look better than
DRI's version, but what about nested directories, or support for squeezed,
crunched, and library files? Lopushinsky's (sp?) LBRDSK (makes library files
look like disk drives) is great, but it would be _so_ nice if the BDOS
understood those other file formats! And how about a CMP2.2 RSX to cache disk
directories or tracks? Or use banks for disk I/O caching?

  I have a copy of DRI's "generic" CPM3 do-it-yourself kit. Since they're not
supporting it any more, I guess they can't kick if I give away a copy. If you
want it.

  Personally, I've been toying with the idea of going to a 68000-based system
and running UNIX or something similar. Or maybe I'll got to CP/M 3.0 myself.
I've been gradually extending the BIOS entry points in my 2.2 system toward
compatibility. It would make it a lot easier to implement large sectors, and I
really like command line editing/recall... but ZCPR33 has aliases and all that
stuff... decisions, decisions. Like is tough :-).

Subj: Details of Intel Hex Format
Hi

i have a very stupid problem: for the first time in my life, i have to create
an Intel hex-file by hand (or rather by a program i wrote, and not by an
assembler or suchlike) to download it ionto an EPROM programmer.
Unfortunately, so far the EPROM programmer refused all my attempts, presumably
due to a format or checksum error in the hex file (it works fine otherwise);
it does beautifully work with other hex files.

Let my explain how one record in the hex-file i write looks like:
each byte is in hexadecimal, written as two (uppercase) ASCII characters.
- a colon ":"
- one byte # of data bytes, in my case "10"
- two bytes load adress, first high, then low byte
- one byte record type (always "00")
- 16 bytes of data
- one byte checksum.
- CR and LF
The checksum is calculated such that the sum of all bytes (including the
"10" and the two adress bytes) is a multiple of 256.

Is there anything wrong with this format ? If yes, what ??

Signed: confused

To: info-cpm@simtel20.arpa

I was wondering if anyone out there is using Turbo Modula2 ona C-128 or
other CP/M+ system.  The reason I ask is that I have been trying it out,
and the thing keeps locking up - forcing me to reboot.  It first happened
several times in the editor, so I went back and started over on the
installation procedure.  Got to the point of trying to use the Filecopy
option in M2, and after it copied a couple of files it locked up again.

I think it unlikely that a peculiarity of the 128 would be causing the
problem since everything else in the world works fine (Wordstar, dBase,
Turbo Pascal, MS Fortran, COMAL, etc), so I was thinking it might have
something to do with the CP/M+.  

Any response from anyone actually using it on any CP/M+ system will be

  I have WordStar 4.0. The verdict: thumbs up! Particular wins, in my view, 
are the properly functioning paragraph reformatting, embedded rulers, improved
WYSIWYG display, and vastly improved installation/tailoring facilities.

  No particular problems to far. Haven't given it a real workout yet. It no
longer includes SPELSTAR, but then I never had it before, either. It includes
instead what I gather is a well-regarded spelling checker package, The Word
Plus. I think I like my own spelling checker better, but then I haven't really
worked this one yet, either. 

  The 8" distribution (that's what I have - you get your choice, of course) 
comes with SIX SSSD disks. I can get the whole thing on one of my DSDD disks,
so i guess it comes to about 750k or so. The distionary alone is something
like 120k, and there are some neat utilities that come with it.

  The documentation is complete, and has a full index. Being very familiar with
WordStar 3.0, I've hardly looked at it. It's not like either the 3.0 or 3.3
stuff. It does contain both tutorial and reference.

  Yes, it's worth the money.

Well, CP/M, CP/M-86, CDOS (Concurrent DOS), MS-DOS, Turbo-DOS,
CP/M-68K and several other, less well-known, DOSes are discussed in
regular columns in the magazine S-100 journal.  This is a new magazine
(only 6 issues printed so far) exclusively for S-100 bus machines
(IEEE-696 bus).  Their address and subscription rates are:
$14.00 for one year (4 issues), $25.00 for 2 years (U.S.A.)
Canada and Mexico: add $3.00 per year
Other countries: add $6.00 per year.  All foreign payments must be in
U.S. currency.  Send orders and payments to:
S-100 Journal
P.O. Box 914
Orem, UT 84067.

The articles tend to be a bit defensive ("Gee, aren't we so much
superior to the PC world?") but contain very good information, and
it's one of the few places where you can find S-100 construction
articles as well as new products for CP/M machines.

I've noticed that the CP/M-80 world seems to be mostly Apple ][
computers with Z-80 cards, or S-100 machines, or old Kaypros.  I have
an original Altair, as well as an NEC PC8801-A/16, both running
CP/M-80.

Subject: HELP!

H E L P !

Is there anyone out there who may have done work on implementing some
other OS than CP/M/Z-System on an Ampro Little Board?  If so, I'd like
to hear from you.

I'm currently trying to put up an MP/M system on the #$%^& thing, and
it's turning out to be a lot harder than I had thought it would.  Any
help would be appreciated.

If anyone has installed CP/M 3, I'd like to hear about that too, if
you're willing to share your secrets.

I picked up both MP/M II and CP/M+ for a song, and I'd like to get both
going, just to see what they'll do.

Actually, the request stems for a desire for information on applications which
run in the TurboDos environment, as I have friends who are running such.
(Also, CP/M is before my time at DRI -- when CP/M was King, I was helping with
TRSDOS (did I say that?)).

I've been using WordStar 4.0 for CP/M for about nine days now.  It does seem
to be BIG improvement on version 3.3 (which came with my Kaypro).  The undo
(^U) is really nice (though I haven't yet had cause to use it), and the improved
printer support is no ad man's hype!  It supports microjustification on most
dot matrix printers (RX-80 etc.).  It supports proportional spacing and the 
built-in underlining on my Toshiba 1340.  It does the bold facing and double
striking by performing a carriage return, instead of back-spacing the printer
to death (as the Qume Sprint 5 driver in 3.3 did).  The installation program
is huge improvement over earier ones.  It now patches the program directly,
instead of laboriously making a copy, and then patching that.  By the way, it
also supports several laser printer (e.g. HP).  No Postscript support, however.

I have found two things (so far) that I don't like.  You can no longer print
a file while editing another.  On the other hand, 4.0 seems to drive the printer
more efficiently, so you get some of that time back.  Second, if you run a
program or the spelling checker from inside WordStar, WordStar "forgets" the
name of the last file that you edited.  Type ^R, and nothing happens.

First, I am not a Wordstar user.  I have recently received a report that 
Write-Hand-Man does not work with Wordstar 4.  WHM is a memory resident pop-up 
desk accessory that has worked with all kinds of configurations in the past.  I
find it hard to imagine what Micropro could have done that would affect WHM and
not Smartkey, and while they might ignore Poor Person Software and WHM, they 
could not ignore Smartkey.  Has anyone had trouble with memory residents and 
Wordstar 4?  I bet that Wordstar 4 is so much larger that the loss of memory 
caused by WHM is the problem but my reports are very vague ("It doesn't work").
  Thanks for any ideas.

To:           Jay Sage <sage@ll.arpa>
 
Jay,
     Is it possible to have flow control processing without having an FCP
installed?  I'm considering eliminating FCPs and RCPs in favor of the jump
in TPA space it'll get me.  Inspiration for this move comes from your bit
on minimal-space Zsystems in TCJ.
                                            Bruce
 
       -------------------------------------------------------------
 
                        FLOW CONTROL WITHOUT AN FCP
 
     While one should always hesitate to say that something is impossible,
that is my reaction to your question about flow control without an FCP.
 
     Flow control is implemented in the command processor through the FCP
module (see the "ZCPR33 User Guide" discussion of how commands are resolved
in the CCP).  Those commands have to be detected and executed regardless of
current flow state and, therefore, have to be in a separate module.
 
     Frank Gaude' gave many examples in Z-News of invoking IF13.COM manually
from the command line (it had to be given a name different from IF so that
it would not be intercepted by the FCP).  This does not achieve proper flow
control and can cause problems.  It only works correctly when it appears
during a true flow state; during a false flow state it is flushed and fails
to kick the flow state up to the next higher level.  If there were no FCP in
the system, you could run IF.COM and could write an ELSE.COM, FI.COM, etc.
to do the right things to the current flow state.  But all programs would
run no matter whether the current flow state were true or false.  The system
would know the flow state but would not act on it.
 
     Flow control could be achieved in this situation by modifying
individual programs to respond to the flow state.  For example, a linker
could be made to check the flow bytes in the message buffer and perform the
linkage only if the current flow state flag is ture.  Under a false flow
state it would simply return without doing anything.
 
     To avoid having to modify every program, one could write a utility that
would test the current flow state.  If it is false, the rest of the command
line would be flushed and the flow state reinitialized.  This program
(called FLOWTEST in the example below) could then be run before a standard
linker in the following sort of command:
 
          ZAS PROG;IF ~ERROR;FLOWTEST;ZLINK etc.
 
ZAS would set the program error flag; IF would set the flow state based on
the error flag, setting it true if the error flag is clear.  FLOWTEST would
run in either case, since there is no FCP, but would flush the rest of the
command line (ZLINK etc.) if the flow state is false.  The normal operation
of complex command lines and ZEX scripts would be seriously affected by this
kind of scheme (there is no such thing as ELSE or FI), however, and I would
not at all recommend it.  But it may help you think of something better.
 
     What I would do instead of eliminating the FCP is to write the smallest
possible FCP, one that would recognize the commands intended for it and feed
them to a COM file for processing.  I have recently been thinking in
background mode of a scheme to get the command processor to perform the
loading of the file so that I don't have to include that code in the FCP, as
is done now.  I think there should be a way to write a fully functional FCP
that takes up only one record (128 bytes).  If the TPA can't stand that much
of a loss, then one might as well just drop back into CP/M.
 
     Here is the germ of a scheme I have in mind to achieve this.  Have the
resident FCP create a phony true flow state one level higher and insert
'FLOW ' in front of the command in the command line.  Then, for example, the
command 'ELSE' would turn into 'FLOW ELSE'.  Because of the phony true flow
state, the command processor would load and run FLOW.  FLOW would undo the
phony true state and perform the 'else' function, adjusting the flow message
bytes accordingly.  FLOW, being a transient, could be as complex and
sophisticated as one wishes.  Other flow commands (IF, FI, XIF, ZIF, OR,
AND, and others that might be invented) would be handled similarly.  The
question is how to fool the CCP into running the command.
 
     Since this whole discussion arose from your desire to maximize TPA, I
would like to add that my next column in The Computer Journal is going to
describe (among other things) a new ZCOM (NZCOM) that does automatically all
of the things (and more) that I described in the previous two columns.  It
can switch to a minimum Z-System for a single command or group of commands
and then switch back to a normal system.  Using SUBMIT it can even switch
back to CP/M, execute some commands, and then automatically return to Z-
System!  I think this will really solve the TPA dilemma with Z-System.  I
plan to get rid of all my manually installed Z-Systems, bring up maximum-TPA
CP/M systems with stripped-down BIOSs, and then use NZCOM to implement Z-
System.

The problem of the PROmM programmer which wouldn't accept home grown
Hex files in my case turned out to be the lack of an end of file
record (record type 01.) I had an "unload" program which took a binary
file and generated a hex file from it. When I sent it to the PROM
programmer, the whole thing locked up. It turned out that until it
saw the EOF record, the programmer still wanted more data. The solution
was to add the following line to the file:

:00000001ff

and everybody was happy.
