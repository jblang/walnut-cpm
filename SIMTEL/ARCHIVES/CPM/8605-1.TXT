The BIOS mod for Z3 is required to set aside AND initialize the buffers used b
by Z3.  When the command processor first begins execution, it assumes the
command line buffer to contain a valid command line, and the address
of the first char (also in a buffer) must be set correctly.  There are also
other buffers whose content must be valid before the command processor is
executed the first time.

I would appreciate getting in touch with folks who employ and care for
the DEC VT-180 Robin.  This CP/M 2.2 Z80 micro is an adaptation of the
DEC VT-100 terminal.

I have no special problems now, but if you have one, you know that it is
a very special machine with a lot of interesting features.  It would be
nice to have someone to call upon when in need.

I recently purchased a 1200 baud Smart Duck modem.  I have had no
trouble with it and I am satisfied with its operation.  It seems to do
everything you would expect of a Hayes compatible modem (plus a few
extra features).  The quality of the unit is not as high as the Hayes,
but then neither is the price.

	A friend of mine, Dick Bollinger, wrote a nice review of
the beast.  He was very pleased with it.  It supports all commands
of the Hayes except ATH2, apparently.  If you wish a copy of

Well, my friends and I have spent a combined total of over $4000 on purchases
from DAK and don't have one bad thing to say about them.  The majority of
what they sell works great, and what doesn't perform up to your expectations
DAK takes back without any problems whatsoever.  My friend bought a printer
from them that he found he didn't like - DAK took it back, no problem.
Another had a problem with his Cerwin-Vega subwoofer; DAK said to send it
back.  He did and soon received a NEW one (not repaired.)  And as for schedules,
I ordered an equalizer from DAK.  They took a little over 2 weeks, so I called
their toll-free line.  I asked about it, and they said it had been shipped "a
few days ago."  UPS delivered it the next day.  I wholeheartedly say that if
DAK has something you'd like, give it a try; you can always send it back.

     I am getting ready to build a SCSI port for my computer so
I can attach a hard disk.  I am going to buy a controller card for
the drive so I don't have to worry about that.  I need source code
for a hard disk driver for SCSI so I can make it work for my
system.  My computer is a NEC PC8801A.  I currently have two
8 inch disk drives on the system.  I may get a controller which will
also control 51/4 inch drives as well as hard disks.  If anyone has
source code for a controller, and would be willing to send it to me, 
I would be eternally (or at least as long as I own the computer) grateful.

                 RELIEF FROM THE 300-BAUD BLAHS

     A Hardware Review of the ADC Phone Modem, Model MD1202

              by Dick Bollinger  -  February, 1986


     One of the truly incredible virtues of high technology is 
that as its products mature, unlike the products of government, 
they get cheaper and affordable by everyone.  Think about it!  
Remember what you paid for your first hand-held calculator that 
now sells for $4.99?  The Pickett slide rule company may never 
recover!

     How about your first ball-point pen?  I remember I paid $15 
for the new Tucker "Wonder" pen.  It was a "wonder" alright.  It 
skipped like crazy and made a blue-stained mess of my hands.  
Today's 69-cent BIC would put any of those first ball points to 
shame.

     The fuss today is over 2400-baud modems.  A few of the 
bulletin boards are already using them.  And quietly the price of 
1200-baud modems is coming down, way down--so much so that those 
of us who have struggled with 300 baud because we couldn't afford 
the luxury of 1200 are beginning to take notice and to take 
heart.  While the Hayes Smartmodem(tm) 1200 still lists for $595, 
that price has eroded significantly (I've seen them advertized as 
low as $349), and a few "clones" have broken the $200 barrier.

     I recently purchased a clone, advertized as a fully Hayes 
compatible "1200 Baud Smart Duck" (the name "Duck" came from the 
distributor's catalog promo, "If it walks like a duck, sounds 
like a duck, and looks like a duck..." What can I say?).  It's 
manufactured in Hong Kong for a company called ADC and distribut-
ed by DAK Industries, Inc, Canoga Park, California.  Its price? 
$169!!

     Does it work at 300 and 1200 baud?  YOU BET IT DOES; SO FAR, 
FLAWLESSLY.  It comes with a 30-day money-back guarantee of 
satisfaction and a 1-year limited Warranty.  More on that later.

     Well, is it really compatible?  Comparing commands listed in 
their manuals and testing the "Duck's" response to the Hayes 
command set, I found only one difference:  The "Duck" DOES NOT 
recognize ATH2, an obscure "special off-hook" command that COULD
BE IMPORTANT to ham RTTY use of the modem.  Otherwise, they are 
identical.  All of the S-register functions and their default 
values are identical too.

     The "Duck" does have three new commands of its own: AT*H 
puts a summary of the AT command list on the screen as a "Help" 
to the operator.  The other two are AT*T, which displays a static 
date and time from the "Duck's" on-board real-time clock, and 
AT*T=MM/DD/hh/mm, which sets the clock.  If this clock is access-
ible; for example, to do stamping of incoming files or the text 
buffer, the manual gives no clue.  Turning power off and then 
back on resets the modem's clock to 01/01, midnight.

     There are several features I like about the "Duck" over the 
Hayes.  Rather than remove a snap-off front panel to get at the 
modem's configuration DIP switches, you simply turn it over on 
its back.  The "Duck" also has a label adjacent to the switches, 
showing the standard (factory) settings and what each means.  No 
big deal; it's just that the "Duck" is a bit handier to con-
figure.

     Here's the one I really like.  The "Duck" has an added 
switch to cause the modem to redial any busy number every 30 
seconds--until it connects or you cancel redialing by turning off 
modem power momentarily.  (There goes your clock setting!  Oh 
well.)  This auto redial is very handy for working busy bulletin 
boards and RCPM's, where it's every man (or gal) for themselves!

     Another plus for the "Duck": It has TWO modular-plug recep-
tacles!  You can plug your phone into the modem and the modem 
into the wall.  Now, why didn't Hayes think of that?  When the 
modem is not powered up and actively "connected" to the line, you 
can use the phone to make and answer calls normally.

     The "Duck" has a speaker, volume control, on-off switch, and 
female RS-232 receptacle, exactly like the Hayes.  Its power 
supply, though, is entirely internal, and it must be connected to 
a grounded, 3-wire ac outlet.  The ac cord set on mine is heavy 
enough for a fair-size waffle iron, but the modem stays quite 
cool.  I suspect that this is a case of component "engineering" 
by availability.  Anyway, I don't think the cord set will EVER 
be a problem.

     But enough about the virtues of $169 Smartmodem(tm) clones.  
The modular wall-to-modem phone cable is supplied.  You will need 
an 8-line (pins 1-8) or 9-line (pins 1-8,20) male-male RS-232 
cable to connect your "Duck" to most any PC, including Xerox 
820's.  The Xerox 820 and 820-II should work alright in the 
modem's factory (default) configuration.  If it gives you any 
trouble, try setting switch 8, 10, or both, to positions opposite 
those shown on the label.  It can't hurt anything.  The rest is 
"Duck" soup.  (Really sorry!)

     The "Duck" comes attractively dressed in a low-boy, putty 
gray molded enclosure and, except for the other guy's distinctive 
"extruded rail" appearance, looks very much like the Hayes.  (If 
you're concerned, it doesn't say "Duck" on it anywhere, unlike 
some "Gorilla Banana" printers I've seen around.)

     The 30-day return privilege is offered by the distributor, 
DAK Industries, Inc., 8200 Remmet Ave., Canoga Park, CA 91304.  
The 1-year Warranty is from the manufacturer (ADC?; no address 
given).  There IS a Service Center address in Van Nuys, CA, at 
the back of the manual, but no Customer Service phone number.

     Speaking of manuals, the one supplied is barely adequate; 
that is, it will get you going.  But if you plan to really work 
the "smarts" of your modem, borrow a Hayes manual from a friend.  
It contains command applications and program examples that the 
Hong Kong tech writer simply forgot to mention or explore.  The 
only things in the Hayes manual that don't apply to the "Duck" 
are the configuration DIP switch information, the Block Diagram, 
and the User Support Information.

     How to order?  That's the easy part.  (Why is it they always 
make it so-o-o easy?)  DAK has a toll-free, 24-hour, 7 days a 
week 800 number to accept credit card orders.  It's 1-800-325-
0800.  You'll be asked for:

     o  Your Zip Code
     o  Your name and mailing address (where to ship).
     o  Credit card type, number, and expiration date.
     o  DAK's Catalog order number:  which is,

              Order No. 4334, "1200 Baud Smart Duck"

     Incidentally, DAK also offers an OnLine Directory of over 
1,100 data bases, with descriptions and access details, for 
$14.95 (plus $2 P&H).  It's Order No. 4358.  I didn't get it, but 
plan to soon.

     The price for the modem is $169, plus $6 for postage and 
handling.  If you're a California resident, they'll add $10.14 
for the governor's campaign fund.  You can expect delivery in a 
week or less.  Mine came in four days by U.P.S.  The package also 
contained an interesting  64-page, full-color Winter '86 catalog 
of sundry electronic gear.  Apparently DAK Industries plans to be 
around for awhile.  All you need, though, is 30 days, right?

   Let's keep the GOOD TIMES rolling - AT 1200 BAUD - at least!

Forgive me for posting this respons, but our mailer (conservatively)
stinks...  You know something is wrong when it is easier to send from
BITNET to UUCP then from UUCP to UUCP.


Well, you come to the right place...

First question:   Which I/O port(s)?   There are several usable I/O ports
including 2 serial and 2 parrellel.   (not to ntion the I/O bus)  If you
are really deperate, and can trash the disk drives (ie. go super-dedicated
and burn PROMs) you can use two more parrellel ports that the Disk Drive
Controller uses.  (I don't really recommend this approach.)

For using the DTR/DTS on the serial ports, those lines can be hardware
jumpered to do either function to allow both port to be used for DTE and/or
DCE equipment.  The information on how to change the settings is in the
book mentioned below.  Access to them is actually best left to going
through CP/m since it is easier then using assembly routines.  You can
you BOIS calls to do the communication, or even output to the serial
ports from the ports on the z80.  Again, more information is 
available in the book.

As to where to get information about them.   Xerox publishes (or atleast 
used to) the "Xerox 16/8 PC Technical Refrence Manual".  It isshould be
available from your nearest service center.   Don't be scared off because
it says "16/8" instead of "820-II" because they are the same machine,
except for the addition of a seperate 8086 processor board in the expansion
bus on the "16/8".   Everything in the manual that doesn't concern the
8086 dual-processor is valid for the 820-II.

If you have any other questions about the 820-II, send me e-mail.  I have
two of them in my basement at home.

Another exception here.  I ordered their '1200 Baud Smart Duck' (1200
baud Hayes compat modem) on December 19th (back when it was $199 -- its
now $169...grrrr).  They said it would take about six weeks for
delivery, but I assumed even more because of the Christmas rush.  You
can imagine my surprise when it arrived on January 6th!  If that's what
you mean by lying about schedules, then let 'em lie!

The modem is solid, seems well built, and needless to say I have had
absolutely no trouble with it.  A good deal in all respects.  Now if
I could only get that $30 back.......

Hi,

Is there any way to format MFM-type disks on the 1571 disk drive on
the Commodore 128?  I know that there is a "Format MFM" disk command,
but I have no idea how to use it.  I am specifically interested in
formatting Kaypro and QX-10 disks.  Any help would be appreciated.

Wrong answer to the question.  "What is the name & address of the *company
mentioned in the ad copy* that sells the directory of bbs's?" was the
question.  I don't know that, either...

I have made innumerable purchases from DAK myself, and have had nothing
but good experience with them.  With the understanding that some of the
ad copy (much/most?) is hype, I have ordered merchandise, in most cases
received it quite promptly (usually less than a week!).  Otherwise,
I received a partial shipment and an equally prompt letter saying that an
item was temporarily out of stock (modulo the items clearly stated as
"closeouts", and only one of those) and would be shipped by such-and-such
a date, only to receive the shipment (except for that one out of stock
closeout) long BEFORE the promised ship date.

Approximately half of the items ordered did not live up to my needs,
regardless of whether I expected them to be better or not, and I returned
them within the 30-day trial period and received an immediate credit to
my credit card.  Other businesses have played footsie with actually
posting the credit, but DAK has always been quite prompt.  To look back
at my record of ordering from them, I have returned just over half of
what I ordered, but they still (apparently) like me.  I still like them.
I take at face value their offer to try some piece of gadgetry for 30
days (I'm a hopeless/helpless gadget freak), and if I decide it's not worth
the money, or just change my mind about it, I return it.

I don't see that I can get anywhere near such a deal from most local
dealers!

The cheapest solution is to replace your 8088 with the NEC V20 chip.
Besides having a superset of the 8088 instruction set it has an internal
z80 emulator, allowing direct running of z80 software.

I have never bought anything from DAK, but I have gotten their catalogs,
and a lot of their stuff looks great.  As far as the Duck, from the technical
description posted here, it sounds almost identical to the Prometheus
ProModem which I paid over $300 for a couple of years ago. Same extended
commands (except @ instead of *), same clock, switches on the bottom, internal
power supply, etc.  The manual seems much better than the Duck manual.
I suppose if I needed another 1200 baud modem I would probably give the
Duck a try since it is better and cheaper than a Hayes (so is the
Promodem, but not as cheap).

This is incorrect. The V20 has an 8080 mode, not a Z-80 mode. 

There are also various software support packages to complete the CP/M
environment by making use of the V-20 processor under the MS-DOS system.
I have heard of public domain ones, but not used them. I use one
put out by Intersecting Concepts called Acceler8/16 (not public
domain). I then run M-80/L-80, DDT, etc. under that. I haven't yet
tried BDS-C, but I think it should work.

Acceler8/16 also includes a software simulator of the 8080, so you
can do the same thing without an NEC V-20 processor. This works
fine, too, but is of course a lot slower.

You can also get MS-DOS cross compilers that produce 8080 or real Z-80
code. I know Aztec makes (or made) one. I've seen it but I don't
have it myself.

Actually the V20 and V30 chips include a more efficient 8088 instruction set,
and since they had some room left over, NEC included the 8080 instruction set
(not the Z80).

I bought a 300/1200 baud "smart" modem from DAK - it was shipped within

Well, just in order to balance an impression, I have bought lots of
stuff from them, from their tapes to manufacturer's close-outs and
always been satisfied.  They sent what they said they would, for the
most part when they said they would.  A couple of exceptions--the last
order I gave them was for a dbx encoder/decoder.  They said it would
be 4 to 6 weeks and I got it in 10 days.  Another time they said 4 to
6 weeks but I got back ordered.  They advised me of this, and gave me
a chance to back out (just like the Fair Trade laws require).  They
didn't nick my credit card until they shipped.  They also *DO* refund
your money if you don't like the product.  No questions asked
(although you do get stuck for the return shipping).  I recommend them
to my friends--no one has been burned yet.

Hello All -

     As (I think) the prime instigator of all the the "I like Dak"
messages (I was the one who asked about the Smart-Duck modem) I'd like
to thank all those who volunteered the information.

     I know that a modem without pins 2, 3, and 7 is usable.  Barely.
However, what RS-232 signals does this thing obey/generate?  DTR?
Carrier Detect?  Ring Indicator?

     Several people have commented about the lack of a detailed
manual.  What *is* shipped?  An interconnect diagram?  An explanation
of the command set?

Subject:  Mix C compiler
To:  info-cpm@AMSAA.ARPA


Hello,

I just purchased the Mix C compiler and Mix Editor (They come as a
package for $54.95.).  I haven't done too much with them yet, but
they look very good.  The C compiler is a full K&R standard compiler,
with Unix V7 and other extensions.  It's very easy to use.  Once
you have compiled a program, you call the Linker, which can translate
the object file to a COM file or let you run it, or several other
functions.  It will link an object file into either a COM file
which depends upon another file that comes on the C disk, or
you can compile it into a totally independent COM file, which will
be longer than the dependent version.

The Editor is one of the best I've seen.  It can edit two files
at the same time, either on different screens or a split screen,
which can be split horizontally or vertically.  It's a totally
programmable editor, and it can be adapted to almost any purpose.
You can also program macros, and all the control characters, etc.
The editor comes configured just like WordStar, and adapted for
structured program writing (Auto-indent, etc.)

Both of these programs are available for MS-DOS or CP/M-80.
The CP/M version requires 2 disk drives, at least 55k TPA,
and a Z80 CPU.  They work on CP/M 2.2 and higher, and are
available in most of the major disk formats, including 8".

The C compiler comes with a large manual, which includes an
introduction to the compiling/linking process, a tutorial,
a reference manual, a section about the functions, and a section about
the tools.

If you have any questions about it, feel free to write me a message.
I'll try to answer your question.

                                               Matt Kimmel,
                                           Matt%UMass.BITNET@wiscvm.ARPA

I am thinking of buying the SEIKOSHA SP-1000 printer that are going these days
for about $200. If anyone has bought one of these I would be most greatfull to
have any comments, whether good or bad about these printers. Even those people
that do not have one but have heard any comments I would still be greatfull to
have any information. Many thanks in advance

I have a friend that bought one recently and has it connected to his

*******************************

I don't know how this conversation about DAK started, but I will add
my two cents worth.... I have purchased MANY items from DAK and have
always been satisfied. There was one item, a telephone HOLD device
that didn't work as advertised. I sent it back and received a full
and complete refund. In addition, I have many friends that have made
purchases from DAK and I have not heard a BAD word yet.....


Does anyone know why this conversation is taking place on this cpm
group ????  Maybe we shuold move it ????

There  was  a  very  good,  both  in  terms  of writing style and nature of
content,  review  of  the  DAK Duck Modem in the most recent issue of Micro
Cornucopia  magazine.   The  writer was very positive about the modem.  His
assessment  was  that,  for  the  price, it might well be the best 1200 bps
modem  buy available.  As I recall, the review described the modem as being
very close to fully Hayes compatible.

Subject: Televideo personal terminal - need help
From: Rex Buddenberg <BUDDENBERGRA@USC-ISI.ARPA>
To: info-cpm@AMSAA.ARPA
cc: BUDDENBERGRA@USC-ISI.ARPA

My Televideo personal terminal hiccupped the other day and seems
to be locked up.  A bunch of terminal attributes (like reverse
video ...) got set.  Keyboard is locked and an Esc-" didn't
do anything.  
The function buttons that set parameters are locked out too.

I was running along and whammo, things went haywire.  The little Board
that drives it was not affected.

Is there any way to make the non-volatile memory that remembers
parameters forget?  Any general reset?

Until I find such button, terminal makes good paperweight.
Anybody got any swift ideas?

I have just purchased a Commodore 128 mouse with the hopes of connecting
it to my Z80/CPM machine.  The only documentation supplied in the package
is the connector pinout.  Does anyone know where I can get the full
technical details for this device?  Items of interest would be schematics,
electrical and timing characteristics, suggested hardware interfaces, and
software drivers.


The connector is laid out as follows:

	PIN	SIGNAL
	 1	UP
	 2	DOWN
	 3	LEFT
	 4	RIGHT
	 5	nc
	 6	BUTTON 1 (left)
	 7	VCC (+5v)
	 8	GND
	 9	BUTTON 2 (right)


The little I could tell about these signals is:

BUTTON #1, BUTTON #2

These lines are connected to one contact of the pushbuttons with the other
contacts to GND.  No pull-up or debounce circuitry.

UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT

Active low signals indicating direction(s) of movement.  UP/LEFT, UP/RIGHT,
DOWN/LEFT and DOWN/RIGHT may be simultaneous and asynchronous with respect
to each other.  Questions are:

	1.  Are these lines pulsed for each 'step' of movement?

	2.  What is the resolution of movement? (i.e. steps/inch)

	3.  What is the minimum/maximum pulse width?

	4.  What is the minimum/maximum high time between pulses?

	5.  What is the output voltage levels?


Thanks in advance,

The C128 'mouse' is not a mouse at all, except it looks like one.   It
is an inverted tracball.  It is simply a digital joystick like interface.
You 'roll-up' (at ANY speed), and it lowers the UP line (pin-1).  Similarly,
for down, left, right (pins 2,3,4 respectively).   The left button is
pin-6, otherwise known as FIRE and the right button is connected in a different
fashion to POT-X (on pin-9).   There is no increments, or timming, or pulse
widths (this is what I consider makes a REAL mouse).   Tracballs work the
same way.   You can use a digital (standard) joystick in place of this
C128 mouse, or a tracball, and the software will not notice (save for no
right button).    This mouse does not even come close to the 'magic' feel
of a real mouse (Microsoft Mouse), but then again it is only $35 instead
of $85 and cheap and marginal is the name of the game in Commodore land.

Cheers,
Gern

   I'm looking for someone that is interested in running a BETA test
copy of a BBS system that has been written in Turbo Pascal. The requirements
for running the system (other than being willing to put the time in) are
as follows:
     1.  A dedicated phone line for the system. If you already are running
         a system, then you should have one of these. (Who knows, you might
         like our system better than what you have?!?)
     2.  Approx. 720k disk storage space or more. The more the merrier we
         all say.
     3.  A 300/1200 baud modem (2400 would be great, but there aren't that
         many out there who can afford them yet.)  For those interested,
         I think USRobotics is still selling the Courior2400 for half
         price to those running BBS system. I could be wrong.
     4.  A real time clock of some kind. This is the biggest boundry that
         I have found in the CP/M market, but hopefully someone out there
         who is interested has one.
     5.  Some paticence with a semi-new system that still has a few bugs
         in it. Remember, this system was written as a senior project and
         the source is over 300k. Hard to debug everything!

   Anyone who is interested drop me a letter.  Oh yes, does anyone know
if there is a copy of Kermit written in turbo pascal? If so, can someone
mail me a copy?

   A copy of the currently working system can be reached at (805) 541-3358
at any of the following baud rates:  300/1200/2400.

Bernie,

I have just uploaded UNARC10.LBR -- Yet another ARC File Processor for
CP/M 2.X.  This one combines the functions of ARCDIR and DEARC.  It is
written in Z80 Assembly Language, and supports the latest ARC file
formats.  Special thanks to this board for providing the C Language
sources of MS-DOS ARC, which enabled me to write the program.

Bob Freed

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks Bob, that was definitely a LONG NEEDED addition to CP/M!  As
discussed, the 'opposite' NARC will be another 'space' and time-saver!

I had only one {minor} problem - since Rainbow's CPM86-80 swallows the
T: since its above the allowed range of supported devices - so I had
to change loc 107 from 20 {T} to 16 {P} - and then use P: to achieve
screen-based listing.  {The error-message was 'slightly' misleading
a'la 'FILE not found' - if it would have repeated the damaged
file-spec, it would have been even faster to correct}.

N.B.  all of the above documented in UNARC10.INF.  Definitely A REAL
addition for SYSOPS too and also a real disk-space and time-saver!

Thanks again to Bob from all of us.

Bernie {waiting for NARC -- Yeah I know, I'm never 'satisfied'..}

Subject:  CBBS Infor Sought

	I am looking for a good PD CBBS program for CP/M-68K,
preferably in C.  I am interested in setting up my machine (a Stride
440) up as a RCPM/CBBS system.  I already have written a "login"
program, which checks an User Authorization File (it reads in a
username and password and then checks for authorization and sets up
drive mappings to selected partitions of the hard disk(s) as
sepcified in the UAF file). The Stride also has a low-level
"Multi-User BIOS" which allows multiple users, each running their own
O/S (I have things setup for multiple users each running their own
copy of CP/M-68K).  All I really need at this point is a basic
CBBS-type program that I can adapt to my system. I am particularly
interested in one that can be exited and re-started (allowing users
to revert to CP/M's CCP (to upload and/or download files) and then
resume the CBBS).  I presently don't have a modem, but plan to get a
modem capable of both 1200 BAUD protocols (BELL 212A and Vadic 3400)
as well as BELL 103.

Marcos, et al,
a pretty good Kermit in Turbo Pascal resides at MARKET (the DEC-MARLBORO
system on the ARPAnet, also available via other channels I don't remember).
In directory TURBO:, as I recall, or perhaps KERMIT:

It's in a .LBR form, and it's a fairly stripped version.  However, it
does have 8-bit and parity handling, plus some system utilities like DIR.

I've used it as the basis for an MS-DOS system (with system-specific
port handlers, of course), but haven't brought it up myself on an 8-bit
system since my Morrow lost its disk controller card!

On the C128, one of the buttons is sensed though a 6526 CIA, the other 
though a port on the SID chip.  Essentially what happens is that one bit
of a parallel output port is used to read in each button press.  Bouncing
has not been a problem, as the port device has a degree of internal pullup,
and scanning this at a 250KHz rate, or thereabouts, at most, we've found
no need for debouncing.  Also, the first button is completely compatible
with the C128/C64 joystick fire button; a large portion of the total
design is based on necessary compatibility with the joystick.

>UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT

These pins emulate the four switches in the standard C128/C64 digital
joystick.

Yes, the lines are pulsed; faster movement results in greater "active" time.
There's a tiny, dedicated microprocessor in the mouse that does the "vane"
pulse to joystick pulse conversion.  These lines are attached to the same
parallel port in the C128/C64 as is the fire button.  

>	2.  What is the resolution of movement? (i.e. steps/inch)

Not sure about these.

>	4.  What is the minimum/maximum high time between pulses?

I think you can "saturate" the pulsing, i.e., if you move it fast enough,
you can get a continuous active output.

>	5.  What is the output voltage levels?

The voltage level into the mouse should be 5v +/- 5% regulated DC, the 
output will be standard TTL levels.

As for programming it, there's a short machine program (6502 code of course)
in the C64 Programmer's Reference Guide, intended for joysticks, which could
be modified for optimal mouse performance.  In the example, $DC00 is the
location of the memory-mapped port.

	;Program to read the direction change from a joystick or mouse.

	DX = $C110		;X direction
	DY = $C111		;Y direction

DJRR	LDA $DC00		;Read port
DJRRB	LDY #$00		;Decode it, buy shifting values right
	LDX #$00		;and testing for the carry bit.
	LSR A			;Bits 0 and 1 modify the Y direction
	BCS DJR0

Re:   UNARC10.LBR

Bernie,

I have just uploaded UNARC10.LBR -- Yet another ARC File Processor for
CP/M 2.X.  This one combines the functions of ARCDIR and DEARC.  It is
written in Z80 Assembly Language, and supports the latest ARC file
formats.  Special thanks to this board for providing the C Language
sources of MS-DOS ARC, which enabled me to write the program.

Bob Freed

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks Bob, that was definitely a LONG NEEDED addition to CP/M!  As
discussed, the 'opposite' NARC will be another 'space' and time-saver!

I had only one {minor} problem - since Rainbow's CPM86-80 swallows the
T: since its above the allowed range of supported devices - so I had
to change loc 107 from 20 {T} to 16 {P} - and then use P: to achieve
screen-based listing.  {The error-message was 'slightly' misleading
a'la 'FILE not found' - if it would have repeated the damaged
file-spec, it would have been even faster to correct}.

N.B.  all of the above documented in UNARC10.INF.  Definitely A REAL
addition for SYSOPS too and also a real disk-space and time-saver!

Thanks again to Bob from all of us.

Bernie {waiting for NARC -- Yeah I know, I'm never 'satisfied'..}

The FORMAT utility on the current CP/M System Disk does not format MFM
diskettes.  I have just received, however, a version of FORMAT.COM that
will format a variety of MFM-type diskettes, including:

	IBM single/double sided
	KAYPRO II and IV
	EPSON QX10
	OSBORNE DD

I am trying to get this 1) through QA, leading to 2) released to production.
I cannot estimate when this will be accomplished.  I will talk to our CP/M
guru and see if a version has or can be made available via this net or other
BBS facilities any earlier.  Keep you posted.

An aside, I have learned that the so-called 'DEC 8th' beta version of CP/M
for the C128 has finally been released to production.  This update has been
available via patch utilities you must download from various BBS facilities.
You could also get it by mailing-in the order form for the DRI manual and
utilities diskette, assuming you have not done so already.  I'll go 'way out
on a limb and see if the patch program can be posted to the net, but I cannot
make any promises.

I'm gonna climb off that limb just now- please be patient!

You might check with the C Users' Group. They had one BBS (the citadel?)

Subj: Changing SWITCHAR in dos 3.x
Date: Wed, 14 May 86 08:36:53 PDT
From: bridger@RAND-UNIX.ARPA

The MS-DOS COMMAND.COM shell uses the forward slash '/'
as its SWITCHAR to designate command-line parameters.
In dos versions 2.x the following line could be added
to the CONFIG.SYS file to change that character to a '-',
allowing the '/' to be used as a separator for directory
names in a path:

        SWITCHAR=-

This doesn't work for dos 3.1.  Is there another way to do it?

Hello NetLand -

     Received DAK's flyer in the mail the other day and saw their ad
for the "walks like a duck..." 1200 baud modem.  Has anyone purchased
one of these things?  How about a comment or two?

/* End of text from convex:net.micro.cpm */


I purchased one of these modems (they are made by ADC) about two months ago
and it works fine. No problems at all! They come with a 30 day refund policy
and a one year warranty.

Subject:  CP/M-68K file upload to SIMTEL20 Help Sought

I have a collection of CP/M-68K programs I'd like to upload to
SIMTEL20, for public access.  The only problem is I don't have access
to SIMTEL20.  I am looking for someone who does have access to
SIMTEL20 and can read one of the disk formats I can produce:

	5.25" -
		Sage/Stride 640K DSDD 96TPI (CP/M-68K file system)
		DEC Rainbow 400K SSDD 96TPI (CP/M-80/86 file system)
		Almost any reasonable single or double side, single
		or double density 96TPI, CP/M file system format is
		posible - my system (a Stride 440) has an
		easy-to-configure low-level BIOS.
	8" -
		Standard SSSD CP/M 2.2 format.

(I can also produce VMS file system 8" disks (DEC Files-11 Structure
Level 2) or various 9-track tape formats (VMS Backup, UNIX TAR, etc.)
at 800, 1600, or 6520 BPI).

Most of the files are in source form (C, with odd bits of assembly
code).  There are a couple of patched object files, which will
probably need to be encoded somehow.  They are compile and run under
CP/M-68K 1.2 and all but one should run on any CP/M-68K system (the
one exception is a program to read MS-DOS disks on a Sage or Stride
under CP/M-68K, although it might even be adaptable).  The programs
include a collection of usefull utilities, including an extended
directory program, some extra goodies for Mince (a keypad hack,
keyboard macros, paren flashing in C mode, mode line processing,
etc.)

I recently acquired an old CP/M machine with no documentation for

documentation on it.  I went in to a few local computer shops and
they had no idea (nor could they sell me more 5 inch hard sector disks).
Is it still being marketed?

Any help would be appreciated.

Quite true!  Rumor has it though that NEC *is* coming out with a Vxx chip
that *will* emulate the Z-80 instruction-set.  I dunno if NEC has made any
public statements about this, but you might give 'em a call and talk to one
of their application engineers, etc.

with a working BYE -- otherwise what good are the existing overlays which

BYE set up for the following configuration, please contact me!

Try a RADIO SHACK dealer, or probably better, a Radio Shack (TRS-80) computer

may be some differences, but an old EP manual for a model-1 would help.

[Pardon the wide distribution but not everyone gets both lists]

Hello Netland...

     I'm the lucky recipient of *three* old Altair/Pertec hard disk
subsystems.. It looks like 5 MB removable/5 MB fixed.  I have the
calibration disk and a full manual for the drives.

     The MITS controllers were included and I am totally mystified by
them even though I have the manual and am of a technical bent.  Would
anyone out there knowing something about this thing send me e-mail?

Thanks in Advance 
Mark

For the curious - the drives are Pertec D34xx-series, top-loading
drives, using 14-inch platters.  They spin at 2,400 RPM and, when
spinning, sound like a DP-center of 10-15 years ago.

Tom,
      I'm wondering, is the machine you just purchased a Heathkit?  The
8-bit Heath machines (the H 8 and H 89) started life with hard-sectored
disk drives.  Most Heathkit stores still stock the Hard sectored disks;
if you can't find them there, try picking up a copy of Sextant or REMark
magazines- they'll have ads from folx who can supply you with hard
sectored disks.

Sweep or NSWP will allow you to rename a file to another user area
on the same drive. Just use the R command and rename the file
to A3:FILE.EXT or whatever.

ALPHATXT.LBR  62k
   AlphaText is an ASCII text formatter for CP/M systems, with the
   ability to produce professional quality formatted documents.  It can
   issue printer dependent escape sequences to control the features
   present in many modern printers.  The user defines these sequences in
   a printer definition file.  AlphaText can also output formatted text
   to the CRT, the LST: device, or to a disk file.  These files can
   later be printed with the PIP utility, mailed to a BBS, etc.

B5-CLOCK.LBR  72k
   This library contains the clock inserts for various computer needed
   for BYE5.

B5C-DCH3.IQS  6k
   TIME routine for BYE5 running on machine with Hayes Chronograph Clock
   connected to second serial port.  This overlay should be easily
   configurable to any system which has an extra RS-232 port to which
   the clock may be connected.

BD02.LBR  10k
   "BD" stands for "Bad Disk".  It reads the records on a disk (floppy
   of hard) and find those that are unacceptable.  It locks out the bad
   blocks containing those records into a file called [LOCKED].OUT.  The
   disk can then be still be used in a normal manner.  It then shows
   what files (if any) are defective.  No source code is provided, but
   .COM and .HLP files are included.  Works with CP/M 2.2 and CP/M-Plus
   (RSX provided).

BRADFORD.LBR  46k
   Lets you use different type fonts (sizes) including near letter
   quality on Epson RX/FX and Star-Gemini printers.  Many different font
   files included in this commercial package.

BU-DDJ-F.LBR  32k
   This is the hard disk back-up program listed in Dr. Dobb's Journal -
   but fixed, and it works.  Use on any CP/M 2.x system with a hard disk
   and floppy drives.

BUPATCH.AQM  4k
   Allows BU to work properly in CP/M systems that have been patched.
   This patch is added to BU.ASM to disable the BDOS patch that makes
   user 0 files public, and to Disable the BDOS patch that sets F3' bit
   when file is written to.

C128BIOS.LBR 130k
   Contains 22 files for the Commodore C128.  Includes the BIOS source
   code, instructions for making the CPM+.SYS file, 40 and 80 column CRT
   drivers, disk controller module, interrupt handler, RAM disk support,
   I/O and system functions, external disk drive support, printer
   drivers, support libraries, etc.

C128NEW2.LBR  78k
   This file is for Commodore C128 users - tells what files they need to
   obtain so they can use a modem in the CP/M mode.  This is the
   information Commodore C128 owners have been looking for so they could
   participate in getting CP/M programs over the telephone.  All files
   except NEWSYS.OBJ are the same as C128-NEW.LBR.  The NEWSYS2.OBJ in
   this library is the Commodore-approved CP/M+ BIOS for your C128,
   dated 6 Dec 85.  The one you have been using (likely dated 4 Dec 85)
   had a warning note with it that it was not as yet approved.

CALLWAIT.DQF  2k
   Tired of your computer calls being interrupted by the call waiting
   feature on your home phone?  This file tells how to use the cancel
   Call-Waiting feature.

COPYRITE.LQW  14k
   Copyright Law as it applies to computers (and programs).

DASMTDL.LBR  18k
   DASM is a disassembler written in the light of RESOURCE.  It
   disassembles to Zilog Z80 mnemonics or TDL mnemonics, depending on
   what options were set when it was assembled.  Built-in documentation
   is included with this program as well.  The COM file in this library
   was assembled for the Zilog mnemonics.

DEARC2.LBR  28k
   Version 1.02 of the CP/M-80 De-Archive program which extracts files
   from PC/MSDOS .ARC files.  Source code written in Turbo Pascal is
   provided, along with a read to run .COM file.  This utility allows a
   CP/M user to access those 16 bit .ARC files that you see everywhere.
   This version automatically adjusts its buffers to any TPA of 48k or
   larger.  Earlier versions were compiled for a fixed system size and
   users reported "insufficient memory" error messages.

DU-TUTOR.AQT  22k
   This is a reference guide to DU (Disk Utility), a famous disk fixer
   from the public domain libraries.  Prepared for The User's Guide
   Magazine, Vol.1, No.4 June 1983 (pages 53-63) by Kelly Smith (TUG
   Contributing Editor) from the original program and documentation by
   Ward Christensen, prolific contributor to the world of public domain
   CP/M software.

EASYBDOS.LBR  94k
   What is this thing everybody is talking about called BDOS?  This
   three part series attempts to answer this question in some detail.

EXTRACT.LBR  6k
   EXTRACT is a program that allows a person to down load a library file
   in its entirety and then extract any part or all of it at his
   leisure.  EXTRACT allows you to extract to various user areas from
   the command line.  The format is the same that Compuview uses in the
   "VPLUS" editor.

FASTPBBS.LBR  8k
   This LBR contains a submit file that makes compiling PBBS easier and
   automatic.  It also contains information on how to set up PBBS for
   more than one SysOp.

FUBBSX.BQS  4k
   Small MBASIC program used to extract the phone numbers for a given
   state from the "Frequently Updated Bulletin Board Systems" list
   (FUBBS for short).

GENEOLGY.LBR  76k
   A complete Family Genealogical database program, written for use with
   dBase II.  Track your family tree(s).

GENIE.CPM  2k
   There is a new National System called GEnie.  This is similar to
   Compuserve but only costs $5 an hour for 3300/1200 BPS access.  This
   file describes the CP/M Roundtable and how to sign up.  If you pay
   more than five dollars an hour to access your favorite RCP/M check
   out GEnie.  300 and 1200 BPS access is only five dollars per hour
   during non-prime hours.  The XMODEM up/downloads are FAST! Almost as
   fast as micro-to-micro.  See you there!

HD64180.BQG  4k
   If you are planning on using a Hitachi HD64180 please note that it is
   not directly compatible with Z80 (tm) style peripheral ICs when using
   the Mode 2 interrupt scheme.

IBACK.LBR  68k
   This library contains the documentation and .COM file to run IBACK, a
   hard disk to floppy diskette backup system.

KMD .HQP  8k
   Help file telling how to transfer files with KMD.  Beneficial for new
   CP/M users who are unfamiliar with file transfer protocols.  Will
   hopefully save SysOps a lot of time trying to answer individual
   questions.  Even the experienced CP/M user might find the information
   of interest/value.  There are perhaps functions available some users
   are not aware exist and might find useful to their normal operation.

KMD-SUPP.LBR  46k
   Two libraries have been made to contain the pertinent information on
   the KMD file transfer program.  This library contains supplemental
   information, much of which was written for first-time readers
   interested in the features of the program and how and why it was
   developed.  This library file also has several peripheral programs
   included which only need to be obtained once, rather than every time
   there is an update to the general source code .ASM file.

KP484Z3.LBR  68k
   The files in this library are those that are needed for the
   installation of ZCPR-3 on the Kaypro 4-84.   Note that this is for
   the new Kaypro 4's only with the internal modem, clock and new
   screen.  These files cannot be used on the older 4's.

KPCW.LBR  6k
   This is a simple Morse Code generating program that uses the "bell"
   in the keyboard of the Kaypro 2X.  Within limits of this equipment,
   it will generate code.  The "limits" appear to be the bell.  The
   Kaypro II has a raspy tone.  My impression is that the bell is not an
   electronic tone oscillator.  Perhaps the same with the Kaypro 2X,
   though the sound is cleaner.  A tone oscillator would produce the
   best tone.

LINEINP.LBR  12k
   LINEINP.INC is a general purpose input module with support routines
   written in Turbo Pascal.  Many programs require formatted input for
   dates, dollar amounts, etc.  LINEINP.INC was born out of the need for
   a common, easy to use interface.

LOCALBBS.IQF  4k
   Phone numbers for bulletin board systems operating in the Detroit
   metropolitan area.

MAKE25.LBR  16k
   This program is designed to allow files to be changed from one user
   area to another.  The user number for a file is stored in first byte
   of the directory entry.  This program assumes that the track and
   sector are set by the search functions and uses a simple BIOS write
   to update the directory.  This program does not copy the file into
   the new user number, only change the number for an existing file.

MEX16SUM.WQ  14k
   An excellent summary of commands in Ron Fowler's new MEX-Plus modem
   program, version 1.65.

MXH-KG11.AQM  14k
   This is a MEX and MexPlus Generic Hardware (MXH) Overlay for Kaypro
   computers using an external modem.  A full-featured SET command
   processor is implemented.

MXM-2406.AQM  16k
   This is a modem overlay for the MEX communication program.  It
   supports 2400 baud auto-stepdown, and works with the Hayes 2400 and
   US Robotics Courier.  Probably others as well.

MXTIMOUT.FQX  2k
   This text file describes a one-byte patch for Kaypro MEX users.  It
   shrinks the file transfer buffer, eliminating timeout errors that
   would otherwise occur when receiving lone files at 1200 BPS on a
   floppy-based Kaypro.  This patch is valid for any computer that has
   disk drives that are "slow" to write a file out to disk.  The default
   file transfer buffer in MEX is 16k, which is too much data to write
   before the sending end times out.

PAIRX131.LBR  4k
   Checks WordStar DOC files for "pairs" of printer control codes like
   ^PB ^PS etc.  Really great not having an entire file printed in
   underline by mistake.

PDFT-046.LQT  12k
   Unofficial summary list of Remote CP/M systems, culled from the
   official RCPM-072 listing.  Intended to be used as a reference guide
   to complement the master listing.  Prepared by Irv Hoff.  For use
   during April, 1986. You would still want to get the master listing
   for full information.  Only 12k, two minutes at 1200 BPS.

PROLNK15.LBR  66k
   NightOwl Software releases ProLink, the great proprietary linkage
   editor, to the public for free distribution.  Included is LINKMAP, a
   REL file display utility.  ProLink is said to be vastly superior to
   L80 as a linker.  Get this one if you do anything with relocatable
   assemblers.

RCPM-072.LQT  56k
   March/April 1986 National RCP/M systems listing.  Systems which are
   strictly MS-DOS have been dropped, as reflected in the list's name
   change from PDSE-nnn back to its former RCPM-nnn name.  This list is
   alphabetized by region, state, and RCP/M system.

RCPM072A.LQT  52k
   March/April 1986 National RCP/M systems listing.  This list is
   alphabetized by state, and RCP/M system.

READCPM.LBR  38k
   READCPM provides the capacity to read CP/M double density
   soft-sectored diskettes from the Heath-Zenith CP/M 2.20X versions
   written on an H89-90 or with CP/M-85 on the Z-100, and transfer these
   files to MSDOS files on a Z-150 or ROM BIOS compatible 8086-8
   machine.

RESQ14.LBR  12k
   RESCUE will recover lost text from RAM.  WordStar disk full, keyboard
   lock up or any of those other things that can happen to you.
   Searches RAM for a phrase supplied by you, when found asks if this is
   your file, if yes loads it into a disk file called RES.Q.  Can find
   text after a warm boot or a cold boot but not after a power down.
   Should run on all CP/M machines.

RPNMF14E.LBR  46k
   RPN floating point calculator.

RS232.HQP  16k
   This is a Practical Guide to RS-232 Interfacing.  The information is
   intended to gather in one place, and explain in simple terms, enough
   of the details of the RS-232 standard to allow a technician to
   construct and/or debug interfaces between any two "RS-232 compatible"
   devices.  A more detailed coverage of the subject may be found in the
   book "Technical Aspects of Data Communication" by John E. McNamara
   (1977, Digital Press).

RSXDEMO.LBR  12k
   This library contains documentation and a program to assist the CP/M
   Plus user in understanding the operation of the Resident System
   Extension (RSX) feature.  Some of the information presented is also
   available in the "CP/M Plus (CP/M Version 3) Operating System
   Programmer's Guide" by Digital Research.

TBDEMO.PQS  10k
   A demonstration database built using Borland's Turbo Toolbox, some
   good examples of how to use.

TRACK2.LBR  40k
   The files in this library are used to keep track of basic telephone
   information, along with various other kinds of data that would be
   especially useful for working with a mailing list.  The system has
   the following functions:

UN33.LBR  12k
   This program is based on UNERASE.COM in the public domain.  It has
   been modified to work with CP/M v3.0, to change the user area of a
   file and to accept ambiguous files names.  It currently works with
   sector sizes of 128, 256 512 and 1024 bytes.  It is placed in the
   public domain by Advanced Logic Systems for public use.  UN3 does not
   work with CP/M v2.2 and requires a Z80 processor.

UNERAS11.LBR  12k
   This program is based on UNERASE.COM in the public domain.  It has
   been modified to work with ZCPR3 Version 1.1 fixed a bug that was
   causing UNERASE to be off by one sector when reading through the
   directory.  It wold miss the first four entries and read one sector
   beyond the end of the directory.

WINDEX21.LBR  10k
   Creates indexes for WordStar files written in document mode.  It can
   be used to index a manuscript of any length, including books up to
   9999 pages, with a maximum of 254 keys.  This updated version can now
   be called up with the WordStar "R" (run program) command, which
   allows the user to return to WordStar after running WINDEX.

XLATE6.LBR  44k
   Translates 8080 to Zilog Z-80 mnemonics.

XLTZ804.LBR  34k
   This CP/M utility translates Intel 8080 assembly language source code
   to Zilog Z80 assembly language source code.  This is a modified
   version of Richard Conn's XLATE2 with several improvements.  It does
   not split long unrecognized macro names.  It uses larger buffers so
   that it operates much faster.  Compare the result of translating the
   file TEST1B.ASM with the results of other translators.

XMDM124.LBR 112k
   This program allows a remote user to transfer files (to or from)
   RCP/M systems running under BYE (remote console program).  It allows
   a caller to control uploads and downloads without a local operator
   being present.  XMODEM is compatible with Ward Christensen's MODEM
   protocol and the single-file mode protocols of MODEM7, MEX, and IMP.
   This version has several bug fixes and some new features have been
   added.

ZHELPR15.RQS  4k
   List of people that have offered their help with problems in
   installing and implementing ZCPR3.

ZSIG-FOR.AQL  6k
   N.A.O.G, the North American One-Eighty Group, becomes NAOG/ZSIG, the
   NAOG ZCPR Systems Interest Group, and embraces all users of ZCPR3.
   Jay Sage is Software Librarian, Richard Jacobson is RAS Coordinator,
   and Bruce Morgen is Director and Editor of the ONE-EIGHTY FILE.
   Membership application and full information are available in this
   file.  A users group for advanced programmers to share their
   discoveries and novice to learn.

ZWORD3.TQT  14k
   Richard Conn and the Staff of Echelon answers the questions: "What's
   the Word on the Z-System?", Is ZCPR3 hard to bring up on my computer?
   What are my options?  How much memory does a Z-System take?  Do I
   have to have a hard disk to run the Z-System?  How much disk space is
   needed?  How can I find out more about the Z-System?

ACREATE3.LBR  22k
   ACREATE now searches A0: and A15: and DCREATE extracts the command
   line from an alias file and puts it in a text file for editing.
   That's right, ACREATE3.COM creates a ZCPR3 ALIAS file from a standard
   text file.  And DCREATE.COM will create a text file from an ALIAS
   file.  The system works well and is fast.

APR86.MQG  28k
   The April, 1986 issue of the Read Only magazine, the monthly news
   magazine of the Tampa Bay Kaypro User's Group and the DataCOM Super
   Systems(tm).  News and reviews of programs, hardware, and peripherals
   for users of microcomputers with CP/M, MP/M, MS-DOS, PC-DOS, or
   TurboDOS operating systems.  These monthly news magazines are of
   interest to all microcomputer users, not just Kaypro.  This issue
   includes the second in a three part series of articles aimed at the
   new owner of an IBM-PC or clone.  This month features some of DOS'
   hidden features and some super FREEWARE programs.

APRBEST.LQT  26k
   Norm Gregory, SysOp of Seattle's "Downspout" Z-Node, provides this
   list (dated April, 1986) of best public domain software for the CP/M
   user.  Brief descriptions of each program are included.  A great way
   to stay informed about new programs.  This list is updated monthly.

BBSUTIL.LBR  58k
   This LBR includes the CHAT, FIND, TIME, and WHEREIS utilities for use
   with remote access systems.

BRADFIX.PQT  2k
   The patches in this file are for BRADFORD, the font program for the
   Epson and Gemini printers.  They may be used to update your COM file
   if you are going to use this program.  The changes have been verified
   for a Kaypro 4-84 and a Xerox 820 with Gemini and Epson dot-matrix
   printers.  Use Patch, DU, or whatever to make changes.

BYE507.LBR 202k
   Program used with RCP/M systems to answer the phone, determine speed
   of the caller, load a bulletin board system, provide time clock
   information. BYE507 corrects problems for CP/M+ users who use a
   different search disk path for local and CP/M+ access.  Also corrects
   instructions for equate selections for PBBS and eliminates
   unnecessary drive motor start/stops for MOTOR users running in local
   "E" mode.  Has both full length and compressed source code
   documentation, and support for various high level languages.

CDIR11.LBR  22k
   This CP/M utility compares the directories of two disks, generic CP/M
   version and two Kaypro specific versions in library.  Kaypro 10
   version allows you to compare any drive/user area of hard drive to
   user 0 of the floppy drive.  CDIR displays the directory of the disk
   in drive A:, with files that are also on drive B: indicated by the
   file name in reverse video if the terminal supports it, or by "*" if
   it does not.  Wild cards are supported.  "CDIR ?" gives a help
   message.  Terminals supported: ADDS Viewpoint/3A Plus, Heath H19,
   IMSAI VIO, TeleVideo series, Wyse50, ADM3A/Kaypro.

CHG11.LBR  12k
   This program is a combination of the UNERA and MAKE utilities.  It
   allows you to change the user area of a program without re-copying
   the entire file.  It can also unerase a file.  Source code,
   documentation, and executable .COM file are provided.

CLNDR13B.LBR  22k
   This is an upgrade to CLEANDIR.  In addition to CLEANDIR functions it
   checks the directory for: Duplicate entries, More than 1 file using
   same allocation block, bad extent number, bad user number, bad file
   name, bad record count.  Tested on Kaypro 10 with both hard disk and
   floppies.  Reports zero-length files.  Especially useful with
   FASTBACK, since it finds things that FASTBACK is known not to like.
   Can check only, without writing.  Z80 only, NO 8080!  Derived from
   SAP with all fixes mentioned in CLNDR.BUG applied.

CRUNCH10.LBR  16k
   "CRUNCH" and "UNCRunch" are stand alone data compression utilities
   which are used in a fashion identical to the popular "SQUEEZE" and
   "UNSQUEEZE" utilities.  They use the Lempel/Zev/Welch algorithm as
   implemented and described by Kent Williams in his public domain file
   "LZW2COM.LBR".  This is the same algorithm which was added as the
   fourth "stowage" type to the popular ARC450.  "Crunched" programs are
   almost always smaller than their "squeezed" counterparts.  This
   library includes a TYPE program that will type normal, squeezed, or
   crunched files, all may be in a library (all six combinations), and
   is only 2k long.  These programs are for Z-80 processors only.

CSWEEP.LBR  20k
   Another one from the Department of Redundancy!  (But Good).  CSWEEP
   is a variant of SWEEP which operates entirely from the CP/M command
   line and has no interactive mode.  Very useful for SUBMIT and other
   command files, and for slogging around big batches of files.  CSWEEP
   does true CRC checking, accepts ZCPR3-style disk/user designator,
   deletes source after copying if requested to do so, recovers nicely
   from BDOS disk errors (with no help from the operator) and more.  It
   will save many keystrokes over SWEEP or NEWSWEEP when moving large
   numbers of files around on your disk system.

DA21B.LBR  8k
   DA is a directory utility (the name stands for Directory Attributes)
   that will run on any Z80 CP/M system (2.2 or 3.0).  It displays the
   files on a disk, the space they take, and the amount of free space.
   Options include displaying and setting file attributes.  The DOC file
   explains how to customize the program by patching the COM file.
   Version 2.0 has been completely rewritten, including redesigned
   display formats, attributes only display under "+-?" operand, and a
   new algorithm improves speed.  Version v2.1B fixed a bug that could
   give incorrect file sizes on some media, allowed use of "?~"
   together, new patches for optional default to "*.*", maximum drive.

DBSQUASH.LBR  28k
   This library contains a small utility for dBase II programmers which
   compacts the ".CMD" files an average of 35-40 per cent, thereby
   saving memory and speeding program execution.  The library contains
   the MBASIC source and a compiled DBSQUASH.COM program.  The COM
   version runs almost twice as fast.  DBSQUASH was written for the
   Osborne I and uses certain screen addressing commands which will not
   work on other machines.  This program is user supported software.

DDTZ.LBR  12k
   DDTZ v2.5 is a rework of DDTY 2.2.5 for improved functionality, bug
   extermination, and complete Z80 support.  In general DDTZ is
   compatible with Digital Research's DDT, but has added and extended
   commands and many fewer bugs.  All Z80 instructions can be
   disassembled.  DDTZ will correctly trace (T and U commands) both Z80
   and 8080 instructions, depending on what CPU is executing.

DEBUG10.LBR  24k
   This is Turbo Pascal source code which implements a low level
   debugging tool similar in nature to DDT or DEBUG which most assembly
   language programmers are familiar with.  When in use, the program
   adds about 600 lines and 6-7K of code and data space to the program
   under test.  The debugger can be used both in memory mode and when
   compiling programs to disk.

DIR1ST31.LBR  14k
   A sorted directory program that displays the first nn lines of each
   ASCII text file.  It permits the user to examine all text files to
   provide additional information on them.  For Z80 computers only.
   Resent version added unsqueezing of squeezed files, skips blank
   lines, and offers a new option "X" to exclude files from the list,
   and option "L" (Libraries) is now defaulted to on.  Minor bug fix of
   this first line(s) sorted directory utility.

DR23.LBR  8k
   The distinctive feature of this alphabetical directory program is
   that it gives the number of 128-byte records/sectors in each file as
   well as the number of K in its allocation blocks.  This information
   is useful when composing file libraries, sending files via modem, or
   checking for different versions of a file.  This version fixed a bug
   in the display, allows easy patching (up to 5 bytes) of inverse video
   on/off routines.

DZ-FEB86.LBR  98k
   This is latest version of DAZLSTAR, an interactive CP/M disassembler
   that works like WordStar on-screen with menus and help.  The new
   version has a comprehensive install program, "side-line" comments,
   active cursor indicator in both ASCII and HEX fields, and greatly
   improved menus.  Extremely flexible.  If you do any disassembly, you
   need this one This replaces all previous DAZLSTAR libraries including
   the DZMENUFX.LBR and any others dealing with the July 85 version.

EPEXAD.LBR  10k
   Advertisement file for EPEX (Environmental Processing EXecutive) v1.0
   This is a replacement operating environment for CP/M 2.2 users.

EXKERMIT.LBR  28k
   A version of KERMIT, the popular communications program, for the
   Osborne Executive.  It is actually taken from the generic Kermit
   written in Turbo Pascal and modified specifically for the Osborne
   Executive.  All I/O addresses the SIO and does not use IOBYTE.

EXRDTRAK.LBR  6k
   This program is for the Osborne Executive, and can be used, in
   conjunction with SID, to read ALL of the information on any track of
   a standard 40-track floppy disk which uses the same type of Floppy
   Disk Controller that the Executive does (i.e., a WD179x Floppy Disk
   Control Chip).  That includes both data and formatting information.

EXWINDOW.LBR  6k
   For those who like the convenience of window-type programs (e.g.,
   SIDEKICK), this program, for the Osborne Executive, will divide the
   screen into two separate windows either horizontally or vertically.
   You cannot have both programs running at the same time but the output
   of the first program will still be there on the screen for reference
   while you are running the second program.

EZ10.LBR  6k
   This program uses the CP/M autoload feature to rapidly execute any
   "COM" program through the use of "abbreviated" command files which
   cause autoloading of those programs, plus execution of any
   pre-selected options.  ("EZ" has been designed to execute "COM's"
   that are used frequently, and which require lengthy strings of
   options and instructions.)

FANFX3.LBR  34k
   FANFOLD is a text file utility to reformat a text file to print on
   both sides of fanfold paper.  It will accept either standard ASCII
   text files or WordStar type document text with embedded soft spaces,
   hyphens, and carriage returns.  The user has control of the output
   format - including two columns per page, characters per inch, lines
   per page, header line, page number placement, hole-punching offset,
   margin and redirection of output.  If desired, FANFOLD will create a
   table of contents based on optional word or phrase delimiters.

FINREP22.LBR  12k
   Eric Gans' (French Department, UCLA, Los Angeles, CA) FINd and
   REPlace V2.2 which adds "V" flag to allow user verification ("Replace
   (y/n)?") before replacement in text files.  FINREP is a search,
   replace program that remedies most of the deficiencies of WordStar's
   ^QA and other similar commands.  Aside from being faster, it has
   important additional features.

FRAC.PQS  4k
   This is a Turbo Pascal program to add or subtract fractions with
   unlike denominators.

FUBBS.AQR  46k
   The un-named successor to Bill Blue's discontinued PAMS list finally
   has a name, "Frequently Updated Bulletin Board Systems" list (FUBBS
   for short).  This is the latest version, released in mid-April 1986.
   This file lists the phone numbers of all known public bulletin board
   systems except CP/M and FIDO systems which have their own
   frequently-updated lists.

GENEOLGY.BUG  2k
   Describes a small bug in EXPLORE1.CMD in GENEOLGY.LBR which may
   prevent the program from printing children's entries, while still
   printing the parents.  It's a one-character fix in one of the
   variables.

GENIE.IDX  2k
   This file contains an index of mnemonics and page numbers to
   illustrate what is currently available on GEnie as of April 9, 1986.
   For details on a free demonstration and optional sign-up please read
   the file GENIE.BBS, available here.

GOTHIC.LBR  12k
   This CP/M utility produces GOTHIC style characters.  This utility
   wants a printer with at least 120 columns.  If your system uses
   interrupts, zero the first byte of the COM file (DI instruction) or
   it will hang.  Uses 3 passes per line to give a good dark mark.
   Known to work with most Epson printers, if 80-column then use
   compressed (condensed) mode.

HDISK002.DQT  10k
   Listing of popular hard disk drive configurations, useful for those
   setting up a new formatting program.  Shows Cylinder and head data.
   Some more are out there - if you add data, bump the version.  Handy
   for some of the inexpensive surplus drives without documentation, as
   well as the newer ones.

IOCAPKP.LBR  18k
   Running I/O-CAP will cause subsequent console output to be buffered
   (16 sectors) for eventual output to disk with a filename called
   USER.LOG.  This file will then be updated as long as I/O-CAP is
   active in the system.  This version added code for Kaypros to
   intercept the control-Z that clears screen, and change it to 1Eh
   (HOME cursor) followed by 17h (Clear to end of screen) on the disk
   output.

K1Z3IN.LBR  34k
   This library includes all the files you need to immediately install
   ZCPR3 onto as many Kaypro One disks as you please.  This is a full
   ZCPR3 implementation excepting IOP and FCP packages.  This
   implementation is intended specifically for the Kaypro Model ONE
   operating under CP/M version 2.2u1 and Monitor ROM number 81-478-A.
   It may also work with ROMs 81-478 and 81-478-B but has not been
   tested with those.

K83ZCPR3.LBR  44k
   This library has the necessary materials for a complete installation
   of ZCPR3 on the "old" Kaypro II's and IV's (models made in 1983
   without video/graphics enhancement).  The package is complete, except
   for certain utilities, which you must get from various RCP/M's and
   Z-Nodes.  All these materials are, of course, available on Lillipute
   Z-Node in Chicago (312-649-1730).

KMD17C.LBR 152k
   Program used by a few RCP/M systems for file transfer to/from RCP/M
   and BBS systems.  It needs no overlay, gets I/O and time clock
   information (if used) from BYE.  Supports KMD batch mode, 1k protocol
   and request for file description.  Recent changes include the "SP"
   (Send Private) option, and mods to correct problems with batch mode
   downloads for some IBM MS-DOS programs such as PROCOMM.  This version
   requires at least two EOT characters be sent to eliminate partial
   files from early termination, also more protection and easier
   installation.  The support utilities can be found in KMD-SUPP.LBR.

KQUESTNS.TQT  4k
   Dave McCord, Vice President of Echelon, discusses the fabulous new
   Bootable Kaypro Z-System Disks sold by Echelon and others.  These
   disks are load and go for Kaypro 10's, 4's, 2's, etc.  You put the
   disk in drive A or C (K10), hit the reset button, and you are full
   Z-System.  Gives you three different versions, including a high TPA
   version and one with full up Z (includes I/O packages).  Also
   includes what many have called the finest book ever written on Z.

LSTOOL11.LBR  40k
   LST-TOOL is a utility program designed to extend the usefulness of
   the MCAT/XCAT or LCAT/XLCAT Disk Cataloging System.  LST-TOOL will
   compare two .LST files created by your disk cataloging program and
   prepare a file called LIST.DIF showing those entries that are on the
   Master List.  It also will read a .LST file and prepare a file called
   DUPES.LST showing all filenames that appear on multiple disks.  A
   terminal installation routine is included that will adapt the program
   to most any Z80-based computers.

LZW.LBR  50k
   This library contains the LZW protocol compression and decompression
   utilities for CP/M.  This technique is used in ARC files, but not
   popular in CP/M.  Try compressing a long file (such as KMD/XMODEM)
   and you'll probably not use it again.  Decompression is a bit faster.
   This is an alternative to the Huffman protocol used in SQ, USQ, NULU,
   etc.  LZW is often more efficient, but slower in all cases.

MBBS45A.LBR 124k
   This is part #1 of Kim Levitt's popular Micro Bulletin Board System
   (MBBS) version 4.4.  No source code is provided but MBBS.COM is
   supplied along with an installation program to allow customization.
   See MBBS44B.LBR for part #2 of this package.

   See MBBS44A.LBR for part #1 of this package.

MBYE&K10.DQC  4k
   This file tells how to install MBYE to implement the use of the 25th
   line for user information display The same video protocol is used on
   the Kaypro 10 and all the other 84 models (284,484,2X,etc) so this
   modification will work on any of these systems.

MBYE41.FIX  2k
   This file supplies the fix for a minor bug with the conditional
   assembly switches in MBYE41.  If MBBS EQU NO, then an undefined label
   error occurs with DSPUSF.

MSWEEP.LBR  28k
   MSWEEP is a utility that will transfer files from a CP/M disk to an
   8" Generic MS-DOS disk or from an 8" Generic MS-DOS disk to a CP/M
   disk.  People using Xerox 16/8 computers with 8" drives will find
   this utility especially useful.  Documentation is in WordStar format.

NEUTEXEC.LBR  26k
   NEUTEXEC is a memory-resident technical character generator for CP/M
   Plus computers and for Epson printers or compatible equipment.  It is
   designed add a set of user-defined symbols to the set of fonts of
   your printer and to make them easily accessible to application
   programs (word-processors, etc.) which do wish to use them.
   Individual characters or complete character sets can also be
   "downloaded" to the program from the document being printed or from
   the operating system.

NOTEFILE.TQT  4k
   Notes toward an imaginary--and much needed--text database program for
   the CP/M public domain.

PBBS-SUP.LBR  66k
   Installation and Documentation files necessary for first time
   installation of PBBS02.  If you are upgrading you will need the
   PBBS02.WQ file from this library to see the new function installation
   settings.  See PBBS02A.LBR also.

PBBS02A.LBR 152k
   This is an update file for PBBS and associated files, a small, fast
   Bulletin Board system.  It offers all of the user tracking features
   of E-MX, all of the features of RBBS, and several features unique to
   PBBS.  All the reported bugs have been fixed and many new features
   have been added.  Most notably: auto reply to messages, comments
   directed to main message base.  If you are upgrading a 1.0 system you
   will only need this LBR.  If you are installing PBBS for the first
   time, you must also get the file PBBS-SUP.LBR (support).

PBBS2A01.FIX  4k
   Fixes a problem to PBBS keeps BYE from doing it's TIME-OUT check
   while waiting for characters from the modem.  This was caused by use
   of BDOS 6 to get character.  Well, BYE has no way of timing BDOS 6
   calls.  So a new routine has been created to use BYE and it's timer.
   Instructions are included in the fix file.

PBBS2A02.FIX  2k
   With the changes in the BYE507 EXIT routine, BYE5 hangs up the phone
   on the user before the statistics print out.  The reason for this is
   somewhat obscure, but the fix is quite easy.  Currently the PBBS just
   does a jump to the error routine in the "REL" file which sets the
   byte at 00h to a CDh and does a jump to location zero, allowing BYE5
   to load and run the PBYE program.  The fix will cause PBBS to load
   the PBYE program and execute it, then call BYE5 to do the log off.

PDLN10.LBR  30k
   PDLN is a version of Digital Research's LINK, Microsoft's L80, and
   SLR System's SLRNK.  PDLN is a linking loader.  It loads one or more
   .REL files into memory, resolves links between them, and creates an
   executable .COM file.  If desired, it can also create a Symbol Table
   file for use with a debugger.  It can search through Library files
   and extract only the necessary modules.  Includes an informative .DOC
   file.  For Z80 only, not for ZCPR only.

PPIP12.LBR  68k
   Slick pip - the Z80 version is fast - CRC and verify options - can
   assemble to pip to destination from source or "copy from source to
   destination" - accepts DU: - other toggles/switches - pip to text
   file with built in editor.

QLIST14.LBR  36k
   QLIST is a CP/M utility for printing squeezed files without going to
   the trouble of unsqueezing them.  It is similar to LISTT in that it
   will paginate, use headers, and permit left margin indentation.
   Version 1.4 fixed problems with headers under different combinations
   of compressed print/expanded header.  Added code to allow header
   message to show total space available for header with all
   combinations of compressed/expanded.

ROYALOAK.DQR  76k
   This file contains the directory listings, including the directories
   of the libraries, of the RCP/M Royal Oak updated April 26, 1986. --
   ([313] 759-6569, 24 hours, 300/1200/2400 BPS.)

RSXMAKER.LBR  20k
   RSX stands for "Resident System Extension", an extension to the
   operating system that resides in memory along with the operating
   system.  This package includes a CP/M utility program to allow easy
   construction of RSX's of your own, and to manage a collection of
   RSX's in memory.  It allows you to install, remove, and show
   information about RSX's.  It also allows you to create RSX's of your
   own so that you needn't use the RSX.COM program to use the RSX.

SAPP12.LBR  16k
   SAP stands for sort and pack (the directory).  It is a must for the
   Hard Disk user.  It makes SD run faster as the directory is already
   already sorted.  This version is fast and efficient.  Try SAPP and
   you will never be without it.  FOR CP/M+ ONLY  (Use SAP.COM for
   normal CP/M v2.2 systems.)

SBDRVJMP.DOC  4k
   A listing for jumping SB180 drives from Steve Ciarcia bulletin board.
   Should be useful for jumpering your drives before installing in
   SB180.

SD115.LBR  80k
   "Super-Directory" is the CP/M utility used by most RCP/M and CP/M
   systems as a "DIR" replacement.  The program displays the contents of
   the disk, alphabetically, by user areas, and includes the size of the
   file.  Optionally, it displays the members of a library.  SD114 has
   added a new option, "$Q", to display files that do not have the
   $ARChive bit set.  This is useful on large hard disks to speed things
   up when backing up a hard disk.  SD115 cleaned up several bugs which
   had been added in recent versions.  You can also use this on your own
   computer, but check the conditionals before assembling.

SFILE+10.LBR  32k
   Allows full wildcard searches of the directories and all library
   files on a CP/M-Plus system for a requested file, starting at A0:.
   The program checks all allowed drives and user areas for a requested
   file or files.  An equate allows for searching into all libraries as
   well, although this usually takes longer.  Used on many RCP/M systems
   with large disk drives and many user areas.  Useful on any large hard
   disk system.  The .COM file is only 3k.  Source code included.  This
   version fixes a bug in the abort routine.

SIDRSX.LBR  4k
   SID.RSX is an extension that adds to the usefulness of the CP/M Plus
   debugger program, SID.  It is attached to your copy of SID.COM using
   GENCOM.  Once this has been done, SID will continue to operate as
   usual, except that there is now a new command available.  You may
   search through memory for given values (either hex or ASCII).

SRT12A.LBR  44k
   General purpose sort program.  Sorts on any character position and
   any key length.  Unlike most sort programs, does not need to keep
   the "before" and "after" lists all in memory, utilizing a method of
   removing the key characters from the lines to be sorted, putting
   just that information in memory, sorting it, and then rebuilding the
   sorted file externally.  Can sort thousands of lines in this manner.

SSTAT18X.LBR  60k
   SSTAT is a substitute for the program STAT.COM that is supplied with
   the CP/M operating system.  It does most of the things that STAT does
   and has some additional capabilities.  It allows you to view a disk
   directory in "ring" format and move forward or backward from file to
   file, see the size of each file in records/kilobytes/ kilobytes
   allocated (rounded to the disk block size), and directory extents,
   get disk space info including number of files in the current user
   area; kbytes occupied on the current user area; kbytes occupied on
   the current drive; kbytes free on the current drive, display disk
   characteristics, display IOBYTE, and change file attributes.

SUPRCKBK.LBR  60k
   SUPER CHECKBOOK in dBase II consisting of 26 routines including
   various output formats.  Allows user to categorized checks by codes,
   perform analysis on codes and run a formatted output.  Also allows
   tax computation in checks and periodic reconciliation.  Also permits
   database of payees and reports etc.  The programs within the library
   file are a dBase II Version 2.4 program.

SUPZAP33.LBR  82k
   SPZ is a full screen interactive disk update utility for CP/M 2.x and
   3.1 systems, providing many of the features found in DU.COM.  The
   program is menu driven, and little additional documentation is
   required.  SPZ requires a Z80 (extensive use is made of Z80 opcodes).
   SPZ enables disk sector editing in HEX or ASCII, using File Relative
   or Track/Sector addressing.  SUPERZAP v 3.2 added operation under
   CP/M 3.1.

THESEUS.LBR  8k
   Theseus is an adaptation for Turbo Pascal of a program presented in
   Paul A. Sand's book, "Advanced Pascal Programming Techniques".  Its
   basic purpose is to demonstrate the use of recursive procedures.
   Theseus first creates a maze (a different, random maze each time the
   program is run) and then solves it.  Thus, it does nothing
   particularly useful, but it is fun to watch.  More importantly,
   studying the code should be most instructive.

TNCDED11.LBR  40k
   The files in this library are version 1.1 of the WA8DED firmware for
   the TAPR TNC-1 and its clones, the AEA and the Heath HD-4040 TNCs.
   It is NOT an upgrade of the TAPR code.  It is a completely new
   implementation of the AX.25 protocol, both the current version 2.0
   and the older 1.x version supported by the normal TAPR code.  It also
   supports up to four simultaneously-open connections on one TNC.  And
   it has a "host friendly" mode, which is intended to simplify the
   interfacing of the TNC to a Bulletin Board or other computer system.
   It has noticeably fewer protocol bugs than the TAPR code, and a must
   more informative Monitor mode.  Version 1.1 fixes some bugs in 1.0
   and offers more features.

TYPRINT3.LBR  14k
   A deluxe "use-your-printer-as-a-typewriter" program.  Sets up various
   printer attributes and sends line-edited text to the printer.  It
   occupies only 2k, and provides a handy means by which to write notes,
   make labels, address envelopes and otherwise produce text without
   creating a file.  Provides a ruler-line to help you know where you
   are.  The COM file is set up for a Panasonic KX-P1091 printer, but a
   ASM file is available for customizing the program to your printer.

USQFST19.LBR  22k
   Exceptionally fast "unsqueeze" program for CP/M use on computers with
   Z80 processors.  UF introduced a new algorithm of Hoffman
   unsqueezing.  Considerably faster than USQ120 and unsqueeze routines
   incorporated into programs such as SWEEP, NSWEEP, NULU, etc.  Also
   extremely short (1k for the COM file).  This updated version, by the
   original author, fixes a file attribute problem and fixes a glitch
   which would cause unnecessary additional sectors to be appended to
   the output file if its length was an exact multiple of the output
   buffer.  Renamed from FU.COM to UF.COM (unsqueeze, fast). Includes
   the source code which can be assembled with M80.

VERSION.LBR  18k
   VERSION provides an easy way to mark CP/M files with version, version
   date, "serial" number, and comments.  The program allows up to 8
   characters for version date, 10 characters for version and serial
   number, and 64 characters for a comment line.  The library contains
   the Turbo Pascal source and a compiles COM file.

WHATSN05.LBR  20k
   This update to WHATSNEW, a program that reads the "XMODEM.LOG" to
   report new files added to an RCP/M system, includes the following
   enhancements: First, it paginates the display, page length or
   override set at assembly time.  Second, if the system WHEEL byte it
   set, the command "WHATSNEW A" will produce a listing of uploads and
   downloads, so the SysOp doesn't have to keep a second copy of the
   program online.

Z8EFIXED.FIX  2k
   Describes a minor bug in Z8E.COM in the terminal I/O section.  It
   interchanges direct and normal I/O BDOS calls which sometimes causes
   the BDOS to return incorrect status to Z8E.  Another problem with the
   I/O is that terminals which require no bias to be added to the ROW or
   COLUMN get bad cursor position information because the normal BDOS
   I/O calls expand ROW or COLUMN 9 (tab) to some number of spaces.  The
   fix is simple and can be entered using Z8E.

ZLUX20.LBR  30k
ZLUX22.LBR  18k
   ZLUX is a ZCPR3 shell for RCP/Ms.  It is designed to imitate the
   functions of LUX but does not require the same amount of overhead to
   run.  Instead of using special LUX*.COM support utilities, it uses
   standard utilities that are commonly available on an RCP/M.  Its menu
   of functions include: BYE, CAT, CHAT, DIR, FILES, HELP, LUX, SEND,
   SENDK and TYPE.  ZLUX 2.0 is a reworking of ZLUX V1.0 in assembly

Sorry for posting this to net, but I **can't** seem to get through to 
"Herlien@drivax" by netmail.  If you ain't him you can say "no" to more
and skip this one.






















Sir, 

Sorry to be so long in replying but I was trying various ways of getting
through to you by netmail & getting stymied left&right.

Much thanks for **your** prompt reply to my original posting.  It's nice
to know there's people out there that like to help.

I was very impressed with your suggested solution to my mucked-up diskette
problem.

The only thing is, well, uh, <sheepish grin> I don't quite **understand** it.

I was a computer science major some couple of years ago, but in the intervening
time I've been a telecomm salesperson & don't do any systems work at all.

Which means I have no idea how to implement your suggested solution.

(In fact, I **did** understand it; that was an exaggeration.  But I don't
know most of the CP/M tools you mentioned in your suggestion, and several
of the ones I knew about I'd never used.)

Is there any way I can get in touch with you to ask a few questions about
this?  It seems that posting via the net would be both slow and rude to other
net.micro.cpm.readers, so if you can trace this back and give me a working
address (I can't seem to make it work from my end), or else send a phone no.
(mine's 415/823-5723 in the daytime, 522-6877 at home) I'd really much
appreciate it.

And, once again, thank you for the suggestion.

Between late December 1985 and April 1986, MIT-MC may have seemed to be
swallowing all mail larger than fairly small.  Anyone under this impression
is correct; MC -was- swallowing such mail.  Due to problems with COMSAT,
the ITS mailer daemon, MC was unable to transmit any mail larger than 2-3
ITS blocks (approximately 10K-15K chars); rather than drop such messages
into the bit bucket, COMSAT renamed them to be files on one of its
auxiliary directories.  Yes, all that lost mail was carefully saved.  So
now that COMSAT has been fixed, we're about to send all this stored,
heretofore untransmittable mail along to its originally intended
destinations.

This means that a lot of mail with very old dates is going to appear over
the next week or so (the process will take several days so as to not
overload COMSAT).  Please don't panic at the antiquity of these messages;
just wait a week and the rush will be over, and then you can return to
receiving normal, ordinary, recently-sent mail.

A lot of these vastly delayed messages have probably already been resent
along alternate paths; we apologize for any duplication.  Please note that
since COMSAT is now much sturdier (anyone interested in the gory details
may direct queries to ANTIQUE-MAIL@AI), it is now again able to deal with
fairly large messages, extensive mailing lists, and combinations thereof.

Subject: CP/M DDT programming question
To: Info-CPM@AMSAA.ARPA
Message-ID: <12208195256.23.SY.FDC@CU20B.COLUMBIA.EDU>

The following procedure is listed in the Kermit User Guide for bootstrapping a
Kermit (or any other) hex file onto a CP/M microcomputer.  We recently had an
opportunity to try it on several different micros, and found that it did not
seem to work.  The DDT program seemed to run OK, the data seemed to transfer
into memory as expected, and the transfer terminated at the right place, but
when it came time to save the data from memory to the disk, a chunk of random
size would almost invariably be lost from the end, even though care was taken
to supply a Control-Z after the last data character.  I'm not an 8080
programmer, and it's not obvious to me what is wrong.  Can anyone out there
find the problem?

The DDT program reads characters from the port into memory until an "@" is
encountered.  Before running the program, the host is given the command to
"type" the desired file, but the command has not yet been terminated with a
carriage return (the DDT program does that).  It is assumed that the IOBYTE is
set so that RDR: and PUN: correspond to the I/O port.  When the "@" arrives,
the program is supposed to write the characters from memory to disk, and
terminate the file with a ^Z.

        -g100,179               ;Execute the program.

After this, the file is supposed to be on the disk.  But usually, only the
first part of the file is there.  Is this a peculiarity of the systems we
were using (DEC VT180 and Vector Graphics 3), or is there something wrong
with the procedure?  Thanks!

Hmmmm, there was a message from someone at commodore saying almost the
exact opposite stuff. They seem to think the mouse did indeed break
the motion into pulses. The pulses were dependent on both how far and
how fast the mouse moved. I will have to track it down (maybe it was
in net.micro) and forward it.

I worked on one many years ago.  I don't have any written
information left, but I could probably remember details if
you have questions.  You said you were totally mystified
by the controller.  It has 4 buffers on the board, and
when you read a sector, the data goes into the buffer.
You can then get the bytes one by one from the buffer
by sending read buffer commands.   This is excruciatingly
slow in BASIC, but assembler routines would work farily
well. (they did as a matter of fact).  Writes work just the
opposite.  You stuff data into the buffer, then command
the controller to write from the buffer to the disk.

I can't remember much more off the top of my head, but
feel free to refer any questions to me.

I plugged the C-128 mouse into the rig of my own design and manufacture
for a Z-100.   I also plugged a regular joystick into the mouse program.
I did not put the mouse on a scope, but the results are conclusive:
The C-128 is not a real mouse, but is an inverted tracball (probably
using the same IC that is in the tracball too).  It does not yield any
stepping increments or my custom software would have been able to detect
it.    A REAL mouse costs money to make, the C-128 is cheap.
The Commodore man is full of it, you can check it out for yourself.

Cheers,
Gern

I have a friend who is interested in obtaining a CP/M based cross assembler
and/or  emulator  for  the RCA1802.  Does anyone know of any such software,
either commercial or public domain?

I  know that 2500 AD was heavily into cross assemblers and emulators, but I
don't have one of their ads handy to check and see if the 1802 was on their
list.

Subject: Where is DEARC2.LBR?

DEARC2.LBR was for the old 4.x versions of ARC.  Since it does not
work with ARC5 and later ARC files, I deleted it.  UNARC10.LBR
replaces it.  UNARC10.LBR was announced to Info-Cpm.

This is the nature of RCP/M-type collections.  When newer versions
come out the old ones are deleted, sometimes after the "what's new"
lists are created.  Sometimes the filenames are changed by the
authors.  I'll try to be more careful to delete such entries in the
what's new list in the future.  I was behind a couple of months and
wanted to get the word out.

I don't have a 2500 AD ad handy, but Avocet Systems also has a lot of cross
assemblers.  They have a full page ad in BYTE (this month, p. 95).  They
have assemblers running under MSDOS,PCDOS,VAX,UNIX,CPM-80, and CPM-86.
They have about 18 target processors, including the 1802.  They have a
toll-free number 800-448-8500 (they put a 1 before it, but we don't dial
the one in Maryland) and their address is PO Box 490-B8, Rockport, Maine,
04856.  They also have a regular number (207) 236-9055, but I would try the
free # first unless you are in Alaska or Hawaii.

I have no connection with Avocet, I have never used their products,
just seen their ads.

Subj:   Testers needed for Backgrounder


Plu*Perfect Systems is completing development of a major
system-extension package for CP/M 2.2 Z80 systems.  It provides
window-like functionality and multiple (non-concurrent) task
operation.  We are ready for wider testing, and thought you
might be interested in helping.  Here's a brief summary:


                        The BACKGROUNDER (v. 2)

MAJOR FEATURES

 - TASK SWITCHING.  Runs 2 applications programs.  Each can be suspended
        to switch to / resume the other.
 - BACKGROUND COMMANDS. Runs built-in commands from within running tasks.
 - BACKGROUND PRINTING. Unspool to printer from a queue of files; spool
        list device output to file.
 - EXTENSIBLE COMMANDS. Add customized commands to command processor.
 - INTERTASK DATA TRANSFER. Cut/paste between tasks.  Background Notepad.
        Screen dump to printer/file.
 - KEYBOARD ENHANCEMENT. Add key definitions to numeric or main keyboard.
        Keystroke recording.  Auto and manual definition loading.
 - ZCPR3 COMPATIBILITY. Supports Z3 external environment buffers.

REQUIREMENTS

 - Z80 or equivalent
 - Standard CP/M 2.2 BDOS or ZRDOS 1.1 or 1.2
 - About 4.5K resident memory (2K of which replaces CCP/ZCPRx).  Most ZCPR3
        systems can relcaim 2K of RCP by using new extensible Overlay Command
        Processor.
 - 100K swap file space (~40K without task swapping)
 - Screen dump, redraw, notepad, cut/paste requires terminal with
        transmit-screen feature or memory-mapped video.

PERFORMANCE

 - ~1 sec. to swap full TPA with ramdisk, 2-4 sec with harddisk,
        10-30 with floppy.
 - 0.2 - 2 sec to redraw screen (terminals limited by baud rate)

COMPATIBILITY

 - Requires that the BIOS adhere to CP/M 2.2 standards
 - Compatible with applications that adhere to 2.2 standards.
 - Some ZCPR3 programs violate standards and can be modified to conform
   (e.g. ZEX).

CURRENT STATUS

 - Well tested on Kaypro '83 and '84 systems with ram, hard and floppy
        drives
 - Limited testing on Ampro Littleboard, SB180, S100 with ram and floppy
        drives
 - Screen drivers completed for Kaypro '83, Kaypro '84, Heath/Zenith
       19/89/90

WHAT'S NEEDED

 - Screen drivers for other popular terminals/computers.  This requires
   advanced z80 assembly-language programming and testing.  About 1K
   of new code must be written, based on current prototypes.
 - Beta testing on additional hardware and applications software.

                -               -               -

If you're interested in assisting and willing to test and contribute
a screen driver, send me a summary of your system(s), including
terminal transmit character/region/screen capability, and disk
drive hardware.

As I am sure you remember, for the last couple of months I have
been trying to increase the number of directory entries on my Altos running
MPM from 1024 to 2048.  I am not sure exactly how I finally got it to
work, but I did.   Thank you to everyone who offered advice, I probably
wouldn't have made it without your help and a little help from above.
Once I am sure this is working (I'll give it a few days to make sure),
I would like to get a C compiler.  Does anyone have any recommendations
for a C compiler for MPM-86?  Any compiler for CPM-86 should work
just fine.  I know someone with Concurrent CPM and Desmet C, and I know
the DRI compiler would work.  I do not need a large memory model, and
price, while not absolutely critical, is a factor.  Please reply directly
to me (MKATZ@UMDB.BITNET or something like that).  Once again, thanks
to everyone who helped.

Re:   US Robotics S-100 update

   If there is anyone out there using the US Robotics S-100 modem,
there is a modification that USR has available that you might be
interested in.  The stock, older, USR S-100 modems are absolutely
incapable of talking to the USR 2400 bauds effectively at 1200 baud
(300 is O.K.), lots of noise on any line.  USR has a replacement
crystal that they were willing to send me at no charge that seems to
eliminate (or at least greatly reduce) the problem.  They say that it
is a higher precision crystal than the old one.  I still highly
recommend against the S100 modem for a BBS, but I must admit that it
makes a better BBS modem than a personal modem.  My next modem will
probably be a more expensive Racal Vadic...

Now available from SIMTEL20:

Filename			Type	 Bytes	 CRC

Directory PD:<CPM.TURBOPAS>
MEMSZ104.LBR.1			BINARY	  4352  FAB1H

MEMSZ104.PAS (ver. 1.04 of MEMSIZE.PAS) is a utility program that
demonstrates the use of Turbo Pascal 3.00A (CP/M-80) system pointers
for both shrinking the program out of the way of CP/M and also then
claiming the rest of available memory for use by the program.

The compiled program will show the effect of memory mapping with
and without the special initialization, so you can see what is
going on.

Using this approach in your programs makes them more portable between
CP/M-80 systems with varying TPA space.

What's new in version 1.04: Use more-precise pointer values

To:       info-cpm@AMSAA.ARPA

Hi all!  A friend of mine recently gave me a s100 card cage that he had
lying around the house, and in it were two cards:

[a] FCD-1 made by Teletek (c) 1980 (rev 6)
[b] Measurement Systems and Controls Inc model DMB 6400 (c) 1979 (rev B)

The FDC-1 looks a lot like a all-in-1 cpu. It has a z80, some ROM (2116),
a zilog pio and a sio, and a nec floppy controller. (Along with the
appropriate connectors) It also has some empty sockets (for 2116s?).

The other board looks like a 64k memory board - has 64k worth of 4116s,
along with the usual ballyhoo of switches and jumpers.

Does anyone have manuals for these things? Or maybe even a running system
that I could get a floppy from so I could have a working system?

Thank you!

Howdy,
     I work as a programmer in the psychology department at the University
 of Massachusetts (Amherst).  My co-workers and I work on Gifford CompuPros
 running CP/M-80, CP/M-86, and MP/M-8/16, doing program development primarily
 in C (Aztec CII, and Optimizing C86).  Unfortunately, we have been unable to
 to find any lint programs or pretty-printers that can run in a CP/M
 environment, which makes de-bugging even more of a hassle than usual.
     If anyone out there knows of such programs, either commercially
 available or in the public domain, or can find C source code to one or both,
 pointers would be greatly appreciated.
                                  Sincerely,

    I downloaded lar.c, xusq107.c, and xtype107.c from pd:<unix.cpm>
    compiled them and have curious results.  Compiles went fine.  lar
    prints the file names and sizes of a library without complaint and
    extracts a .dqc file without a complaint -- oh yes, the machine is a
    DEC 8600 under ULTRIX, a BSD 4.2 clone --.  However, xusq core dumps
    with a "segmentation error".  xtype does also.

    Any ideas.  Thanks for your time and thoughts.  Tom.

Yes, Tom.  xsq, xusq, and xtype were for earlier versions of Unix.
They don't work on BSD 4.2 and no one has fixed them, as far as I
know.  We've allowed them to remain for those using older Unix
versions and also in hopes that someone would fix them for 4.2.

There is a version of sq/usq that will work on BSD 4.2.  It's in:

Filename			Type	 Bytes	 CRC

Directory PD:<UNIX.CPM>
SQU-PORT2.SHAR.1		ASCII	 44835  1990H

This is a "portable" version of sq/usq that has been compiled and
tested the code with the following compilers on the following systems:

system "C" compiler		Xenix (Altos 586)
system "C" compiler		Unix BSD 4.2 (Vax 780)

Now available from Simtel20:

Filename			Type	 Bytes	 CRC

Directory PD:<CPM.KAYPRO>
KAY256.LBR.1			BINARY	  8448  72D7H

This library contains details on adding 256 K of RAM to the Kaypro 4
computer (pre 1984 model).  As most UK Kaypro II's contain a 4
motherboard it applies equally to them.

Additionally the design can be used with any 8 bit computer that uses
64K dynamic RAM's.

No software is included here but if you wish to construct this for a
Kaypro the author has written a BIOS that supports the RAM as a
ramdisk under ZCPR3 and is available from him for the asking.

The following files are included in this library:

1.  HOWTO.TXT    - Detailed instructions
2.  CIRCUIT.TXT  - The schematic diagram
3.  BENCHMRK.TXT - Not essential, gives an idea of benifits likely
                   on disk intensive activities.

Trevor, I will get the Small C Compiler from mod.sources (that's on
Usenet, not Arpanet) and announce when it's available from Simtel20.

    I have an original set of Digital Research CP/M+ v3.0 for
the Commodore 128, consisting of one 5 1/4" disk and one manual.
Since I have no use for it, I'm giving it away rather than tossing
it. This is an unused, legal version. First reply takes it.

Hi.  I'm trying to find out how to transfer data from a Wang word
processor to a CP/M computer.  I've done disk transfers from many other
types of computers, but I have no idea what kind of disk format the
Wang dedicated word processor might use.  Any ideas?
           Thanks,

	Fellow CP/M-users,

		The xmodem program that I use on my vax system (BSD4.2)
	is located either in PD:<unix.communications> or PD:<unix.cpm>.
	Both are written in C language, and of course both are available

There were a couple of xmodem programs posted to net.sources recently, both
of which work on the BSD4.2 system here (I use them because I dislike
kermit).

People:

    I have a immediate need for a device to connect two computers 
to one serial printer.  The cheaper and the quicker the better.

    A straight Y-jack did not work - one computer printed fine, 
the other appeared to, but nothing came out.  The order on the Y-
cable made no difference.  The computers are both NorthStar 
Horizons and the printer is a IDS Prism132.  RS232 serial 
interface on all.

    I could use a A-B switch, but that's about as much problem as 
switching plugs (which is what I'm doing now.)  Although all in 
the same room, the people using the computers can't see which 
computer is currently attached to the printer.

    We lose a lot of characters and bits on the floor if you 
output without the printer connected (and it makes a mess at the 
back of the computer :-)

    Assume all the bauds rates are the same, and the everyone can 
hear the printer to avoid two users trying to both print at the 
same time.

    I saw such a device recently in a catalog - but $65 is too 
much for three plugs and (probably) a couple of diodes.  But how 
should those things be connected up?

[A message from the author]

Bernie,
 
Uploaded UNARC11:
 
"UNARC is CP/M 2.x+ utility which lists, types and extracts files in 
MS-DOS/PC-DOS archives (*.ARC files).  For Z80's only.  UNARC11 has 
new command syntax for typeout (suggested by Irv Hoff's ADIR change 
to UNARC10), to solve problem when used with a CCP replacement like 
ZCPR.  Also, help display is simpler, COM file is smaller (4k), and 
configured version for RCPM's is supplied.  (Retain UNARC10.INF and 
UNARC10.Z80 from old UNARC10.LBR.)  UNARC11.LBR is 34k, 267 records."
 
Note that you were not the only one (just the first) to have trouble 
with the "T:" syntax in UNARC10... In fact, it seems the ONLY system 
this worked on was plain CP/M 2.2 (and nobody uses that anymore!).  
At any rate, this new release fixes all that.
 
I am amazed at the speed with which the program circulated around the 
country:  It's now being used on many RCPM systems.  (I knew it had
achieved legitimacy when Irv Hoff, of MDM7 fame, called about making 
some changes.)  Thanks again for the upload to SIMTEL-20.
 
In the meantime I am busy working on the companion 'NARC' utility...  
As they say, "Real Soon Now".
 
UNARC11S.LBR contains the two files UNARC11.Z80 (source program)
and UNARC10.INF (technical information), both squeezed.  These were
omitted from the released library, UNARC11.LBR, and are now being
provided separately due to popular demand.  69k, 545 records.

Bob Freed

Note from Bernie..

Eventually Bob will split "source and technical description" into an
ARC-file {why not, UNARC can read them and ARC-format is more space-
time saving}. Also be aware, that this 'minor' update has no major
changes in funtionality. It gets rid of the T: device and also gives
a 'patched' version for SYSOPS. So if You were 'happy' with 1.0, no
need to download 1.1!

Rgds,
Bernie.

I would like to support what was said in favor of DAK, with some reservations.
I was one of the people they lied to about schedules, ship dates, etc., BUT
still am a relatively pleased customer.   The problems seem to lie more with
the shipping department than with DAK as a supplier.

Most of the items I have ordered were well worth the price.  In the three
cases so far where I did not like the product, DAK was kind, prompt with the
refund, and generally nice to work with.  I would certainly NOT use them for
any time-critical merchandise, but for general material they are very good.

Also, they are not alone in problems.  I ordered the 1200 BAUD ADC Modem from
DAK and a Jade 1200 Baud modem from Jade at the same time.  Both said they
would be shipped the next day.  Neither was.  After numerouse phone calls and
hair pulling, the DAK modem arrived first and in good working order.  The
Jade modem arrived last and arrived DEAD.  On calling Jade, they suggested
that I call the manufacturer because the problems with these modems were
almost always just minor adjustments...ad nauseum.  It was only with great
reluctance they agreed to take the equipment back and then were three weeks
late in crediting my account!  I've had similar problems with virtually every
computer and/or electronics house I've ever ordered from (except INMAC, but
you pay for that service).  If you want to complain about this, complain
about the entire industry!

 You may have hundreds of answers to this by now but here is one more.
Use new sweep and just rename it from one user to the other. Most everyone
has a sweep and new sweep is just great.
