Mr. Garson then talks about the SIMTEL archives ......

HOWEVER, I'm gonna throw in my $0.02 worth and say that the best CP/M
BBS I've seen is the PICS system. It's written in (Turbo ?) Pascal, and
has all the neat features you expect from a BBS. It is a little
different from a RCP/M in that you never actually get to see the A> or
A0> or whatever prompt, but since there is a BBS program looking after
security etc. it's much easier to do, since vanilla CP/M doesn't really
understand the meaning of the word security (3.0 may be better than 2.2
I just haven't read the documentation enough yet).

Hi,

Does anyone know where I can get a copy of Dbase II? I have P&T CP/M and
it is mentioed in the manual, and I need it to read the Simcpm.idx index
from Simtel20,. but I can not find it anywhere. Can someone suggest a
vendor, or if it is PD software?

Subject: New CCP features.

OK, I'm looking for ideas: I just finished seriously hacking Z80CCP
from the SIMTEL20 archives to do what _I_ think a CCP should do. Given
that it has:

	Automatic Submit operation: if a program is not found either where
		said, or on A0: it throws it at SUBMIT.COM;
	Paging TYPE;
	LIST (TYPE to LST: w/o pages);
	ERA tells you what it's going to erase, and asks about all
		wildcards, not just *.*;
	Civilised USER number handling: I can say B3:PROGRAM, and it
		does the sensible thing, also B3: does the same as
		B: / USER 3;

_AND_:

	about 256 bytes of space left over;

we come to $64,000 question. What do I put in the 256 bytes left?

Basically I'm looking for some small, neat, _USEFUL_ idea to use that
last bit of space. (If this was for the Voyager probe, I'd try to tuck
a pattern matching algorithm in, but I doubt this will ever make outer
space :-) ). It is worth noting that the USER command has been ditched
(it's now redundant), as was the CLS, which I did not consider useful.

Suggestions by E-mail to the address below, or post if you think everyone
wants some neat ideas. If I get enough response, I'll summarise.

The USER command should not be ditched, for lots of reasons: --

  -- Losing it invalidates some shell scripts;
  -- Novices using (old!) "how to use CP/M" books will become confused;
  -- And sometimes you want to change the user number, but don't know

Subject: QX-10/16 VT100 emulation

We are looking for a working VT100 emulator for the QX-16.  We currently
are using an MS-DOS program called Pibterm that was hacked by someone to
address the serial port properly, but this program does not properly
handle scrolling regions, and most of our VAX applications software uses
them.  Our success with other MS-DOS terminal programs has been dismal
due to the very non-MS-DOS-standard way that the 16 accesses the serial
port.

However, it seems that if you run a 16 in CP/M mode (ie, off the Z80),
you wouldn't come across this difficulty.

So the question is, does anyone know of a VT100 emulator for CP/M that:

     -Will work on the QX-10/16
     -Handles VT100 scrolling regions properly
     -Can do most video attributes (bold, inverse, underline, blinking)
     -Can support speeds up to 9600 baud (Xon-Xoff flow control is fine)
      without dropping characters

That sounds like a tall order, I know, but if the answer can be found
anywhere, I think here would be the place.

Thank you very much.

That experiment just about ruined the company. I was an employee at the time.
Management pushed this "semi clone" against the advice of senior engineers,
who wanted NorthStar to develop a true clone, or to work on other proprietary
designs. So much time and resources was spent on this kluge board that
NorthStar could not meet the growing IBM/DOS threat effectively. From then on
NorthStar was doomed.

  No.  It allows you to use more than 64K of RAM and makes it easier to

X3.64 does not do graphics like circles and diagonal lines and such.
It does define how to invoke color text.  ("$" below means the ESC char)
  $[30m = use black text	$[40m = use black background
  $[31m = use red text		$[41m = use red background
  $[32m = use green text	$[42m = use green background
  $[33m = use yellow text	$[43m = use yellow background
  $[34m = use blue text		$[44m = use blue background
  $[35m = use magenta text	$[45m = use magenta background
  $[36m = use cyan text		$[46m = use cyan background
  $[37m = use white text	$[47m = use white background.

If your screen normally has white text on a black background, you can
make it inverse video by using either "$[7m" or "$[30;47m".  For other
escape sequences, check the manual on any VT100 compatible terminal.

I don't think you understood what I said.  I said I had a SOFTcard
which is from Microsoft and not the Applicard which is from PCPI.
However, I'll take what you said into consideration, even though
I'm stuck with a SoftCard.

The Alspa Zero-Net will boot TurboDos, I know, and might boot CP/M if the
BIOS was ever created for it (to my knowledge it never was, at least by
Alspa Computer, but I left there in early '83, a couple years before the
actual demise of the corporation - not that there was much doubt about the
eventual outcome long before then - but I digress...).

The Zero-Net disk formats are a bit unusual (Ron Alspaugh's forte -
optimising disk formats for speed :-), so you're not going to be able to
boot from just any DS/DD disk. A brief explanation:

First, the sector skew is encoded in the track image. In a "normal" disk,
the sector numbers are encoded 1-2-3-..., in the Zero-Net (actually all
Alspa DD formats are similar) they are encoded something like 1-4-7-2-5...
This eliminates the need for skew tables! :-) Still, the only penalty to
you for using an incorrectly sector-labelled disk would be slower 
performance.

A bigger problem arises in identifying the disk type. The Zero-Net used an
awful scheme the particulars of which I've forgotten over the past 6+ years.
I don't think it used the ACI-1/2 scheme of encoding the disk format in byte
0x7F of sector 1 track 0. As I recall (I'd have to look it up to be sure) it
saved it in the sector header, under disk SIDE! It goes something like: 0 
(and 1?) are standard CP/M SS/SD (IBM 3740) format, 2 & 3 are DS/SD, 3 & 4
are DD/SS, 5 & 6 are DD/DS (I seem to remember it went higher, but memory
escapes me right now).

The Zero-Net boots from a disk differently than most CP/M systems, which
normally boot from a reserved track and sector. Under Zero-Net, there are
no reserved tracks - excepting, of course, standard SS/SD disks. Instead,
the boot ROM, which has knowledge of all the disk formats, looks for a file
with a particular name, something like 0BOOT.COM, and loads and executes it. 
That file, the boot loader, then looks for another file presumably containing
the TurboDOS system image, and loads that.

All this by way of saying that you either need the two files on a SS/SD disk
to get going, or an Alspa-formatted DD disk. If you have other Alspa floppies
around, you might try them in case the system files are present on them.

Otherwise, there are two courses of action open to you:

1. Send me e-mail. I may have a Zero disk around (if I can get my ACI-2
TurboDOS system to boot). It's likely to be a very old and buggy version,
unhappily. The TurboDOS writers were madly revising the system at the time,
and the version 1.22? that I've an image of may be very old. 

2. Join the Alspa mailing list (which has been very quiet for several
months). I believe there are some Zero-Net owners there, and they may have
the scoop on more recent version. From my .mailrc file (edited...):
To join the list send request to:
	...!ssyx.ucsc.edu!alspa-users-request
For submissions to the list:
	...!ssyx.ucsc.edu!alspa-users


I would encourage followups to this to be conducted on the mailing list.

Does the "Search for First" function (#17) in the BDOS call

*'s to ???'s, or does the BDOS take care of that?

IF BDOS accepts '*' , does it accept it even if it is NOT the last character?

The answer is yes!

At least one version was distributed on the net recently under the name UZI.
I haven't tried it out so I can't comment on whether (or how well) it works,
although I recall it really needed a fast disk because of the swapping it 
does.

obviously has many features but I have no documentation (particularly about
the screen codes). Some I have determined by examining code provided on the

(e.g. inverse video) to survive beyond a CR/LF. 

Any assistance in this area would be appreciated as would information as to
how to obtain a user handbook and/or a circuit diagram.

A private email reply would be most appropriate since I doubt there are
many people interested in this machine and its peculiarities.

Its been a while since I've done any programming using FINDFIRST but as I 
remember you do need to place the '?'s in the FCB.  I seem to recall that
the parsing function (152?) could help to expand the '*'s if you are using
CP/M 3.0.

Yes, there is a Unix for Z-80.  It's called UZI (neat name, yes?)
I have the source, I think Simtel has it as well.  It is in C with 
a potload of inline assembler.  It was posted to comp.unix.sources
a few months ago.
Laugh, and let me know if it works.

It's called U.Z.I. (Unix Z80 Implementation). Source is on Simtel (I think),

I would also be interested in this.  Has anyone looked at UUPC to
see if it could be ported to a CP/M compatible environment?  It
might be easier to make something like this work under the 
Z-System then under standard CP/M-80.

I have been looking for a hard drive to add to my CP/M Kaypro, and one
of the drives I have been considering is the Seagate St-125.  It sounds
perfect for what I need: 3.5", 40 or 28 ms access, shock mount, low
power.  But, considering the reputation that the 225's (and other 
Seagates) have earned, I am reluctant to plunk down my hard-earned
bucks on a drive that is going to self-destruct.  Does anyone have
any experience with the 3.5" drives from Seagate?

>X-Mailer: Mail User's Shell (6.5.6 6/30/89)

me too.

(What about it, Dave?  Are you going to release your cp/m 'g' protocol
yet?)

I use xmodem and a couple of scripts (started manually on the cp/m
machine) to download stuff from the Unix host, and upload stuff I've
edited locally.  I think it would be a piece of cake to write a
terminal emulator script to call a unix host, log in, invoke xmodem,
download the spooled mail/news or whatever, then delete them from the
spool dir.  It might even be possible to have a restricted shell which
can run only a few commands (rx, sx, rm) on the unix side...

The same script could then take the local cp/m files, upload them, and
pipe them through mail or inews -h and then delete them on the Unix
side.

I assume that since cp/m is not multi-tasking - multi-user that these
up- and download scripts would always have to be invoked manually.  On
the other hand, if the Unix host could poll the cp/m machine running a
bbs system...

I assume that Dave Goodenough has these scripts for qterm; I further
speculate that someone has MEX scripts to do the same sort of thing.
You don't have to run uucp to network to another machine.  Some fancy
scripts (with error-recovery, security, etc) will give you the same
effect.

Of course you'd have to have some code (probably shell scripts) on the
Unix side of the system, but I still think the project is pretty easy.

My cp/m box is a laptop (Bondwell Model 2).  I don't have the need or
the desire to download Unix mail or news and then upload replies,
because it's easier to use the machine on my desk at work.

The answer to the above question is a qualified yes. I have a port of UUPC to
CP/M-80 (using Aztec C), but it is not fully debugged.  Actually, it's only
barely debugged - I haven't gotten it through the dial-up sequence yet. :-)
  
It's also a port of the original version released to the net two years ago,
and I understand that UUPC has been revised and improved since then.
  
Progress is likely to be slow as I am temporarily working two jobs and don't
have the time to futz with it right now. (This is my third run at the problem,
and the second promising one - I have *some* idea of the rough road ahead. :-)
  
There may be another version available soon, but the developer of that version
will have to speak for himself, if he so chooses. One way or another, we'll
have it!!

The same script could then take the local cp/m files, upload them, and
pipe them through mail or inews -h and then delete them on the Unix
side.

I assume that since cp/m is not multi-tasking - multi-user that these
up- and download scripts would always have to be invoked manually.  On
the other hand, if the Unix host could poll the cp/m machine running a
bbs system...

I assume that Dave Goodenough has these scripts for qterm; I further
speculate that someone has MEX scripts to do the same sort of thing.
You don't have to run uucp to network to another machine.  Some fancy
scripts (with error-recovery, security, etc) will give you the same
effect.

Of course you'd have to have some code (probably shell scripts) on the
Unix side of the system, but I still think the project is pretty easy.

My cp/m box is a laptop (Bondwell Model 2).  I don't have the need or
the desire to download Unix mail or news and then upload replies,
because it's easier to use the machine on my desk at work.

Those files are compressed with a program called "CRUNCH".  You use
a program called "UNCRUNCH" to uncompress them.  Those programs are
self-documenting, so by typing "UNCRUNCH", "CRUNCH", "UNCR", "CR",
or whatever, you will get a syntatical diagram on how to use the
program.

Yes there is.  It's a program called ARKxxx where xxx is the
revision number.

There is a program called NULU151 which does the job nicely.  It
will not only extract members of an .LBR file, it will unsqueeze
them, too.  However, I would like to see an uncrunching facility
added to it.

Subject: AAARRRRGGGGHHHH! Ram chip hassles

Forgive the widespread post, but I am being driven quite insane by
this nagging problem.

I am in the process of upping the speed on a PCPI Applicard for a friend
of mine. I was able to do this successfully on my Applicard, with parts
in my toolbox, but now my toolbox is empty, and I need to buy some more
RAMs. 

I need 64Kx1 dynamic RAM chips, like 4164's. They need to be 100 ns.
They need to work with 7 bit (128 cycle) refresh. I have called 20
different people (really! I counted!). Every single person I talked
to apparently didn't know what I was talking about. As I talked to
them, I could see (even through the phone!) this strange blank look
come across their face.

Am I the only one in the world who understands the difference between
7 and 8 bit refresh??? Am I going to have to buy 256K RAM chips and
waste 192K of RAM to make this project go???

This project is for a Z-80. When the Z-80 refreshes, it puts a 7 bit number
out on the high 7 bits of the address bus and generates a special refresh
read signal. Some RAM chips will work just fine when only every second
row is refreshed. These are called 7 bit refresh cycle RAMs.

P-P-P-P-P-Please, eddie!!!!

At last a question I can help with!  A friend and I ran a BBS on a
Morrow MD11 for a couple of years (Starling CP/M+ RCPM).  We used BYE510 
and Metal 1.31f (from the First Osborne Group) - we found Metal to be
OK, if lacking in security.  In three months I'll start up the BBS again 
using BYE510 and PBBS (Pencin/Cottrell).  Any BBS operation will require 
a clock, though - the Morrow lacks one and lacks the time:: routine in
the BIOS.  I'm using a Hayes Chronograph connected to the AUX port of
the Morrow.  There are better, easier and more elegant solutions but it
fitted the budget at the time and has been reliable.  Source for BYE510
is available from most RCPM's as are the PBBS45 source.
Hope this helps,  Larry Moore  CP/M conference chair Canada Remote

The Z-System has an extensive set of library (LBR) tools.  VLU is a
full-screen shell that will display, and extract in uncrunched form,
a .?Z? file.  LTYPE will view in scrolling mode a crunched member of
a library.  Other tools, such as LGET and LPUT, can be used to extract
and insert members.

These tools, like the Z-System, continue to evolve with improved
features.  Recent versions of LPUT, LDIR, and CRUNCH maintain the
datestamps of files inserted and extracted as LBR members, when hosted
by a system running DateStamper.

JetFind, a fast string-search utility with grep features, will search
sQueezed and crunched (?Z?) ascii and WS files inside one or several
libraries.  Options allow extracting matching lines or the entire file.

Z-System tools are available on Z-Nodes and simtel20.  The latest
versions of the Z-System (NZ-COM for CP/M 2.2, Z3PLUS for CP/M Plus),
and also JetFind, are available from Sage Microsystems East and
Plu*Perfect Systems, and also selected Z-Nodes.

Subject: NEC 8500 TELCOM/MODEM7 Bugs; Kermit for this beast ?

	The NEC 8500 has a resident TELCOM program that does MODEM7 transfers.
	8-bit up/downloads using this software frequently fail after a few
	buffers and start NAKing the host.  I haven't figured this out entirely,
	but I do know it is sometimes related to baud rate, i.e. a file that
	NAKs out at 2400 bps might come down at 1200 or 300 bps.  Some files,
	like 8-bit document-mode Wordstar files uploaded to a host from the
	NEC, always seem to NAK-out after 16 (decimal) packets, at anywhere
	from 50 to 9600 bps.  Move a 7-bit text file either way with the
	same setup, host, and software on both ends, and it goes just fine.
	Has anybody riddled this out yet ?

	Better yet, anybody know about a kermit that runs on this beast ?

From "CP/M Operating System Manual" (Digital Research):

"An ASCII question mark (63 decimal, 3F hexadecimal) in any position
 from f1 [First character of file name] through ex [Extent byte] matches
 the corresponding field of any directory entry on the default or
 auto-selected disk drive
"
So, I think a '*' is not allowed and the caller should have expanded it
to '?'s.

Usually, the '*' is considered the last character of the respective part
(filename and/or extension), so
	a*.ext	is converted to	a???????.ext
		as are
	a*ything.ext
	a*******.ext

	a*.b*	is converted to a???????.b??

A Z as the middle letter of the file extension indicates a LZV crunched file. Look for crnch24.{.arc,.ark,.lbr} for source and uncrunch.com -
ARKP04 is the latest version of a SEA arcfile creator that runs under CP/M - UNARC16 is the latest version of a SEA arc member extracter/list.
Latest project is to have an UNZIP that runs under CP/M which extracts and list directory of a 'ZIP' archive - saw a note predicting within two months it'll be ready for release.  A couple of us in Toronto are thinking of writing a 'zip' archive creation program that would run under CP/M (it's a slow hot summer and we've gotta do SOMETHING to keep the juices going  :-)   ).

Hello.

As far as I know, T.I. is the only company that (used to) manufacture
256-cycle refresh 64K DRAMS.  Most, if not all, of the Japanese
made 64K DRAMS, which seems to dominate the mail-order market these
days are definitely 7-bit (128-cycle) refresh.

Just get one, and let me know what the brand name is.  I can look it up
for you, or you can call your local sales office of the manufacturer.

Those mail-order people should AT LEAST know WHICH brand name they are
selling, if the do not know what the refresh cycle is!

I got my '180 books from Hitachi (there were two) and my '280 books from
Zilog.  I was working for TRW at the time I asked for them, and wasn't
given any static about paying for them.  Note the '180 has bastard pin

Subject: TVI806, Getting Software, Etc.

Well, I just recently started playing with my Televideo 806 again, and realized
I didn't have *ANYTHING* useful. Even the copy of ASM I have seems to do wierd
things with seemingly legal (to me 9-) lines. It is, unfortunately, the 8080
version of ASM, & I need to find a whole *BUNCH* of Z-80 tools for the TVI. I
would appreciate anyone pointing me to where to get stuff.

In addition, I have a few specific questions:

1) I also have an IBM PC/XT - I remember there was a program for this which
   would convert just about any CP/M format to another, or between MS-DOS & any
   of the CP/M formats. Could someone please offer to mail me a copy, if you
   have it handy, or tell me where to get it?

2) C compilers - whose are they, how well do they work, how much do they cost?
   I've dealt with C before (on the PC), & since UZI is written in C source
   I'd like to look into C stuff on the TVI. I'm also interested in UZI, since
   my first project would probably be to write a decent Csh-like (as close as I
   could get it 9-) shell for my beasty.

3) Anyone else got a TVI-806 on the net? It's not exactly a common machine,
   I'll grant you. Kind of cute, though. Wish I could figure out how to get at
   the 6 RS-422 ports on the back of the machine - they seem to be made for use
   with Televideo's multi-user OS, which I've heard was 'cute' in the ultimate
   sense of the word (9-).

4) Does anyone have any assembly source I could grab for dealing properly with
   the serial ports, up to about 9600 or thereabouts?

5) I believe a bunch of people mentioned an archive sitting around, how do I
   get to it? In addition, are there any FTP sites with CP/M stuff?

As to exactly what I'm using, it's a Televideo 806, 60K, running CP/M 2.2 (I'd
love to get CP/M 3.0, but can it use the BIOS from 2.2? I doubt it). It's got a
20 Meg (closer to 13 when formatted, etc.) fixed disk, with A: & B: being the
HD, & C: being the 5 1/4" floppy. Far as I know, it's got a Z-80A in it (Z-80
of some sort, at least). I'm using a Wyse terminal as the console.

					Thanx, <Mowgli>

PS. Sorry about the basic questions, but I just got here 8-)

Subject: CP/M-68k editors

The question was raised about alternate CP/M-68K editors.  Jon, It depends
on what system you are running (I mean the HOST hardware).  There are
several alternative editors.  

One, if you have the CPU speed, is to use one of the CP/M-80 emulators
and run any of the traditional CP/M full screen editors (WordStar, 
VEDIT, etc.).  

Two, I believe there is a PD full-screen editor on SIMTEL-20 for the
CP/M-68K system.

Three, MINCE (MINCE Is Not Complete Emacs) is available for CP/M-68K.
I think TriSoft may still have a copy or two on the shelves.

Four, there is also a visual editor from ERG for CP/M-68K, but I
don't recommend it.  The evaluation copy TriSoft received certainly
had a lot of bugs.

Five, pick up a copy of some good editor in source code for the
Atari ST-520.  It should be easy to 'port it.

Let me know if I can help.

I don't think that the Kaypros ever had 8080's in them.  However,
to answer your question, I have been using a program called QTERM
which I have found to be a neat little program in that it not only
offers VT100 emulation, it offers a variety of protocols, like
Xmodem in almost every of its incarnations, including Modem-7
batch.  It also supports Ymodem.  The one thing that ought to make
it a boon with calling Unix systems is that it has the Kermit
transfer protocol.  I'll see if I can mail you a copy (configured
to work on the Kaypro).

Subject: 7 bit refresh

RE:

>I need 64Kx1 dynamic RAM chips, like 4164's. They need to be 100 ns.
They need to work with 7 bit (128 cycle) refresh. I have called 20
different people (really! I counted!). Every single person I talked
to apparently didn't know what I was talking about. As I talked to
them, I could see (even through the phone!) this strange blank look
come across their face.

Am I the only one in the world who understands the difference between
7 and 8 bit refresh??? Am I going to have to buy 256K RAM chips and
waste 192K of RAM to make this project go???


Well I was able to locate data for 4 mfg of 64K DRAM and all but Toshiba
were 8 bit refresh. Note that ALL the data sheets for 256K DRAMS list them
as 256 refresh cycles/4 ms (A0-A7) including Toshiba. * bit refresh seems
to be the industry standard for 64K and 256K DRAMs.

The following info is from the respective mfg data sheets:

Toshiba: TMM41164P-2  128 refresh cycles/2ms(A0-A6) but only 120 ns

NEC: uPD41464-10 256 refresh cycles/4 ms (A0-A7) 100 ns

Hitachi: HM50465P,CP Series 256 refresh cycles/4 ms

TI: No longer lists 64K DRAM but the old(86) data sheets lists the TMS4164
as 256 refresh cycles/4 ms (A0-A7)

Subject: Need for Epson Disk conversion software

I currently have an Epson Geneva (PX-8) laptop computer together 
with a PF-10 portable disk drive. As you may know, Epson decided 
to have a non-standard format for their floppy disk layout for 
this system. As a result, while there is a good bit of CP/M 
software around, any of it distributed on disks for more popular 
CP/M machines won't work when trying to read it from other 
formatted disks. Does anyone know of any software that could be 
used to read such a disk, bringing the material from the original 
disk into RAM disk, and rewriting it back on to another disk in 
the Epson format? Any suggestions would be appreciated. Thanks in 
advance.

(1) I have lost the information on how to get the additional disk
of "standard" CP/M utilities for the C128 (ED, the assemblers,
etc.).  There was a card to mail in that came with my C128D, but
I've lost it.  I got my machine a couple of years ago, and I *think*
I registered my copy of CP/M.

(2) Does anyone know where I could get (public domain or fairly
cheap):
	* a decent CP/M text editor
	* a Z-80 assembler (I understand the one that
	  comes with CP/M uses 8080 mnemonics--I like
	  my LDIR)
	* a C compiler (I understand there's a good
	  PD C compiler that comes with source)

I read comp.sys.cbm fairly often, so you can reply either by posting
there or by email.  I *don't* read comp.os.cpm very often, so email
is preferable to posting there.

Thanks,

I suggest you give Applied Engineering's CP/AM a whizz.  It has a
program called "RAMDRIVE" which works on //e computers equipped
with ramcards like AE's RamWorks (it won't work with RamFactor or
with the Apple card that you have.  BTW, it ought to be in a slot
other than 2 because that's the standard slot for communications
devices (eg modems, etc.) unless you have a reason for locating it
in slot 2).  However, there is a program with it called "PC" which
will check to see if you have Protocol Cards (I think that is what
it stands for...) like the Disk 3.5 controller (a Central Point
Software Universal Disk Controller will work fine and I strongly
suggest it), a RamFactor, or other cards.  I think it might
recognize your card.

However, if you're using Microsoft's CP/M, as far as I know, you're
stuck.  I haven't seen ramdrive software that will work with
Apple expanded ram cards which are in the public domain.

Subject: TVI806, GETTIN

C compilers - since you have an IBM PC I'd suggest getting the HiTech C package from Workman & Associates ... a Z80 CP/M ANSI C compiler that runs very well under a MSDOS CP/M emulator (or with a V20).  Produces good fast CP/M .com files ... you might be able to run it directly under CP/M 2.2 but it likes a LARGE TPA and doesn't seem to like CP/M+ (Morrow HD), and ran poorly on a borrowed Xerox 820-II CP/M 2.2. Might be OK on a Telewidget?^
For use directly under CP/M, nothing I've found beats Manx Aztec C - overlays, roms, DRI or MicroSoft compatable assembly output; 
runs stabily.  Missing a few of the ANSI extensions and also the bit field but otherwise quite fine.
Pricey though.
Hope this helps.

Subject: Uh-oh....  (was 7-bit Refresh)

Well, I am a currently enrolled student living in the college-provided
housing (a.k.a. Dorms).  It so happened that I had to move almost every
semester and go home to Korea over the summer, which means that having
databooks that fill a 4-by-six space was a drag, which lead me to "weed
out" duplicate and "obsolete" copies.  I knew I shouldn't have, but
the "friends (like the recent popular music proclaims)" forced me to.

I say, never trust your "friends!"  I just realized that most companies have
decided to cut back (or discontinue) on their 64-k DRAM products!  The only
databooks that list them are the old ones that I was about to have replaced!
Which means, while the companies ARE still producing 64K DRAMS for
"maintenance" purposes "ONLY," and those parts are available in the market,
I don't have any data on them!

256-K DRAM's (even 64K by 4) are ALMOST WITHOUT EXCEPTION 256 cycle refresh,
which means that they can NOT be used (with ease) with true Z80 (*&D#%ing,
eh!).  MY SUGGESTION, at this point, would be to use 32K by 8 STATIC RAMS
(Hey, don't gasp...)!!!  They are only $15 each, at most, these days int the
mail-order world, and are getting faster by the day.  Pseudo-static RAMS
are not a bad idea, either.

For your information, Hyundai made 256-cycle DRAMS, and Motorola and Oki
made 128-cycle DRAMS.  So did Mostek, but they merged with SGS-Thompson,
and no DRAMS in their databook!  All 128-cyclers are 2mS refresh.

                         John Shin

P.S.  Like I said, it would be also a good idea to get the brand of the
64K parts from the shop and ask the manufacturer, although telling a
256K chip that it is a 64K ship isn't such a bad idea, either.

Subject: New CCP features - summary of suggestions

OK, the polls are in for what you think I should add to Z80CCP. These are
the suggestions:

Ken Yap <lakart!xait!garp!rochester!ken>
Paul Sander <ima!decvax!Atherton.COM!paul>
Jon Peticolas <ima!decvax!decwrl!ucbvax!cbnewsh.att.com!jlp>

These gentlemen all suggested history, something like the C-shell !!
and the likes. Well, with some _REAL_ dirty trickery, and the assumption
that you have a _VANILLA_ DRI V2.2 BDOS, no Z-system, or anything else,
it's in. It works like this: Use ZSID / DDT / Whatever to create a file
of at least 17 blocks, and fill them all with zeros: call it

!CCP.HIS

and put it on A0:

Now, whenever you execute a command, it's saved. To access them, you
enter ^K (that's control K) in response to the A0> prompt, hit return,
and you get the previous one. Hitting ^K ^M again gets you another
command. As it happens, I have 16 programmable function keys on my
machine, so I keep one loaded with < ^X ^K ^M >, where the ^X clears
the command line, ^K is the "up" character, and ^M sends it it. So
repeated hits on this function key step me backwards through my
history. If I were a good kid I'd add ^L or something to go forwards
as well.

Once you have a previous command up, it's just like you typed it in,
but didn't hit return yet - you can then use backspace etc. to edit
it, when you're happy, hit return and away it goes.


Tom Bopp <lakart!xait!uhccux.uhcc.Hawaii.Edu!tbopp>

Suggested the following:

>1. A smarter DIR command, to include file size and space available.
>
>   b3>DIR *5:afn    should work
>   b3>DIR A*:afn    should work
>   b3>DIR **:afn    should work like whereis

OK, I didn't do either of these (i.e. wildcarding drives & users) or
adding filesize / free space since I have utilities to do these,
HOWEVER .....

>2. A command TYPEB (or BTYP, or ???) to produce a DDT-like dump of a
>   binary file.

I did this, and called it DUMP (what else :-) ). But, it wouldn't fit in
the CCP, so I dreamed up the following, which will allow any self
respecting hacker to add anything they like to the CCP.

I created a second "section" of the CCP - resident in A0:!CCP.SYS, that
is called if the CCP is trying to match a command it can't find in it's
own table. It's not always present, it gets loaded when you enter '!' as
a command _OR_ start a command with '!', so:

A0>!DUMP B7:FOO.BAR

will load the extra code, and then do the dump command resident in the
extra code. I've set the extra code to live at 0x8000, and with my CCP
starting at 0xd400, I have up to 20K to play with - lots of room :-)

THE POINT OF THIS is that you can put whatever you want into this
extra addon code, so the customization possibilities are limited only
by your imagination.

>3. A command FEED which would send a FF to the printer.

Trivial, it's in the main CCP code.

>4. A command MENU C:  which would display a list of all .COM files on
>   drive C:, with menu numbers; typing a number would run the program.

Would take a bit of doing - if you want it, throw it in !CCP - you will
find that !CCP is going to become the place where I suggest doing
everything.

>5. A toggle (^F ?) to redirect printer output to a file.  To capture screen

Almost impossible from the CCP level - this takes work messing with the
BDOS, with a TSR. Oh well, I'm 4 and 2 so far .....

!CCP.SYS again - you've got 20K to work in. ..... No, seriously, that's
why I invented the !CCP.SYS approach - it allows an easy hook for doing
custom mods.

> How about IN, OUT, PEEK, POKE ?

Same again .....

> How about LOAD <COMfilename> and RUN ?

This gets interesting. The only reason to do these is if you're going to
take PEEK & POKE to them, and if you do that, they'd better be 32K or smaller.
I suppose you could move the load address for !CCP.SYS up to (say) 0xb000
or somewhere. Note that RUN can be achieved without any code added to the
CCP by creating a file RUN.COM on A0:, size zero bytes.

> I wish I had the space to implement the multiple byte OUT format.

Now you do :-)

Again, I left the memory paragraph SAVE in the regular CCP, but to add
another command to !CCP.SYS - well there's still lots of space to play
with.

Now, for one of my own ideas - COPY needs to go in !CCP.SYS, it would be
a PIP type thing, but I'd have it a bit more flexible:

COPY A3:FILE.XYZ = B7:*.Z

would concatenate all .Z files on B7: and put them in A3:FILE.XYZ, have
it reset before each operation, no more BDOS ERROR on C: R/O


And finally,

Mitchell Wyle <xait!harvard!cs.utexas.edu!uunet!mcvax!inf.ethz.ch!wyle>

Suggested:

> What about a couple of programmable functions (from Bourne's shell):
>
> A0> for FILE in `ls *.TXT` ; do

Again, almost impossible to do from the CCP. However, for those that
are interested, I have a utility to do this sort of thing: I call it
FILSUB. A typical command line might be:

A0>FILSUB [B:*.Z] `EM *.*`

which gets expanded to a $$$.SUB file that takes EM (my editor) to each
.Z file on B:. FILSUB has several other features, but this is the one
that was being asked for, and knowing how I did it, I doubt I could
fit it in the CCP, any more that SUBMIT is part of the CCP.


Again, this is not a closed issue, any other neat ideas will be welcome.

I have a question about CP/M-86 (and Concurrent CP/M-86):

Does anybody know about a C-Compiler (Better: C++) for CP/M-86 that also runs
under Concurrent CP/M-86?
I have only a Version 1.0 of Digital Research C (1981). Very slow, not
Standard, 8087-Lib doesn't work, only the small-memory-model runs under CCP/M.
Has anybody heard about a C-Compiler that has a 8087-Library, is able to link
Assembler-Code or other languages?
And: Where can I buy this Compiler?

Thanks for a response.
Frosch, Karlsruhe.

Subject: Epson PX-8 Disk conversions

Paul N Burgess wrote looking for a way to get disk conversions from the 
Epson PX-8 / PF-10 disk drive format.

The most recent version of MSDOS Media Master supports the PX-8's disk
format, if you can find an IBM PC clone with a 3 1/2 inch drive.  The
720 Kb models are fine; I don't recall any problems with the 1.4Mb ones,
but am not sure we have tried it.   For probably-obvious reasons, Media 
Master is pretty sensitive to having a 100% compatible controller out 
there, and does not get along with "installable" device drivers, such as 
would come with after-the-fact controllers, very well at all.  Most of 
our conversions have been done with a PS-2 Mod 30.

I don't have any idea whether the CP/M-based versions of MediaMaster now 
support the PX-8.  You would need a supported machine with DSDD 3 1/2
inch disk drives, which does not impress me as likely. 

For many purposes like this, we have adopted the alternate solution of 
finding another CP/M machine that can read appropriate disks, then 
running the data down a wire into the Epson using Xmodem, Kermit, or 
whatever.  Then one lets the Epson write its own disks.

You will find that Epson's designers were quite clever about that 
machine.  From reading the drawings, I suspect that they intended to 
permit pulling the 80C80 and replacing it with a 16-bit processor at 
some stage.  But other bits of cleverness like this make it incompatible 
with almost anything you can think of once one gets down to the hardware 
level.  I gather that this has been a generic problem with Epson
computers. 

MediaMaster comes from Intersecting Concepts.  Last address I have handy 
is 68 Long Court, Suite 1B, Long Beach, CA 91360.

No affiliation with companies or endorsement of products mentioned 
above, but we have found them to work.

Subject: getting kermit to work

I have an Osborne Executive computer that I would like to use as a spare 
terminal. I would like to use kermit, since it is free and it is on all
of my other machines.  I have tried to get it running by transfering the .hex
files from Columbia to the Osborne via my IBM, using a program called media
master to get the Osborne to read the IBM disks.  I got the program called 
mload running (apparently) from the hex file and used it to assemble the 
two pieces of Kermit (the system independent and the system specific files)
Unfortunatly, Kermit hangs when I attempt to connect (enter terminal mode), but
operates normally in other respects.  Does anyone have any idea what I might 
be doing wrong?  Is there some special configuring I need to do?  

Failing that, does anyone know of an easier way to get Kermit running on
my machine?  

Thanks.

Help please!

I thought that perchance this was a good newsgroup to ask for help in.  I'm 
sitting here _trying_ to get my trusty Kaypro 10 to talk to it's serial 
interface.  The Superterm program seems to have no problem, (2400 8N1), but 
whenever I try to access the port from pip, basic (m,c,s,&o), or bdos calls, 
the machine sits there and hangs.  I even tried going directly to the Z80 SIO

Any suggestions?

Thanks,

Subject: Uh-oh....  (was 7-bit Refresh)

[In various articles, people proposed all kinds of solutions for the 
128-cycle Z80 refresh problem. I still had my answer to the original
writer lying around and thought it might be useful to others, so here
it goes:]

In article <398@uop.uop.EDU> he wrote:
>I need 64Kx1 dynamic RAM chips, like 4164's. They need to be 100 ns.
>They need to work with 7 bit (128 cycle) refresh. 

The most 64K DRAMs are 7 bit refresh. From memory, Hitachi, NEC, Fujitsu
are all good. Texas Instruments is not. 128 or 256 bit refresh is clearly
marked in  the databook. 90% of the 64K RAMs (usually those from 
The Land Of The Rising Yen) are OK.

If you still only get access to the remaining 10%, there is another
trick using some extra circuitry. Get an extra 4040, connect the clock
of the 4040 to RFSH of the Z80, and use Q7 as the extra refresh address
you were missing. Use a 74153 as multiplexer for the extra addr pin:

During R/W operation, A14/15 is fed to the RAM's, which you needed to
build anyway because the old 4116's didn't have A7. During refresh,
Q7 is fed to the RAMs. Because Q7 toggles each 128 refresh periods,
it refreshes all columns.

I hope this is clear enough. Good luck!

>Am I the only one in the world who understands the difference between
>7 and 8 bit refresh??? Am I going to have to buy 256K RAM chips and
>waste 192K of RAM to make this project go???

256K chips are even worse. They have 8/9 bit refresh, so you have 2
address bits to add. You can use Q8 of the 4040 and the other half
of the 74153 to do this if you like, and have 256K available
(with the multi-task, multi-user Z80 system I built with a group,
we even have 384K available, enough to support 6 CP/M user simultaniously.
How 384K is addressed with a Z80 is another story, available on request).

Why?  It's only compatible with CP/AM which limits you to Apple CP/M owners.
For a considerably lower amount ($0!) you can get ZCPR 3.3 and remain
compatible with any other Z80 machine running ZCPR 3.3 (or CP/M 2.2 if you
limit yourself).

There ARE other CP/M cards besides the slowpokes from AE and Microsoft.

The PCPI card has numerous drivers in the public domain (it has a standard
way of installing any appropriate driver that you choose).  There might
be one for an Apple memory card.

If you don't have an Applicard, perhaps its time you left 1MHz in the dust
and got an older card which still has yet to be beaten at 6MHz.

Applied Engineering, when you gonna wake up and smell the roses?  This card
is at LEAST 5 years older than the Z80 Plus and runs 6 times faster.

From my (limited) experience with CP/M I would say that You can't just
buy a "ramdisk driver".

What You need to do is to change Your machine's BIOS to allow the entries
	HOME, SELDSK, SETTRK, SETSEC, READ and WRITE
to recognize Your RAMdisk.

Depending on the (current) implementation, it would probably be
sufficient to modify HOME, READ and WRITE, as the other ones merely
update some memory locations with the desired values which are later
used by READ and WRITE (with respect to HOME, my CP/M Operating System
Manual says "The disk head of the currently selected disk (...) is
moved to the track 00 position", although You can "translate into a
call to SETTRK with a parameter of 0" which in turn "...seek the
selected track at this time or delay the seek until the next READ or
WRITE actually occurs").

You could probably call the RAMdisk disk E: (A:-D: being used for floppies).

Sure it beats those cards.  But what about //c owners who want to
run CP/M?  Just tell me where one can get an Applicard-type device
for the //c and I'll be happy knowing that you're a little bit
rational.

BTW, what about those of us who can't currently afford an
Applicard?  What are we to do now?  Are we in the stone ages?  We
might, but if we get the job done, and it may take a bit longer,
who cares?!?!?  You have to realize that a lot of us can't go out
and get an Applicard at the snap of a finger.  Money doesn't grow
on trees, you know.  I personally want an Applicard myself, but I
just can't afford it.  Is there something wrong with that?  If you
think there's something wrong with me because I should be running a
PCPI card instead of a Microsoft one, and I'm able to get stuff
done, only at a slower pace, there's something wrong with your
ability to reason, bud.  SERIOUSLY wrong.

Go to wherever sells your favorite IBM peripherals and buy a
half-height 360k-style drive.  A friend of mine has one which came
with Teac drives.  He took them out and put them in his XT.  He
took the XT drives and put them in the TPC1 and it worked fine.  As
for installation, I don't know if you should let the dealer do it
or you should do it yourself for warranty reasons.
