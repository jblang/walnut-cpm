        Well, I haven't the foggiest what the enduser upgrade will be.  Or if
there will be one.  Requires a lot of mods to a 2.2 BIOS to take advantage of
some of the performance enhancments.

        CP/M3 is capable of doing disk I/O 10-20 times faster than optimized
2.2 systems, especially on hard disk systems.  It can run with the BDOS mostly
banked, and use alternate banks as L.R.U. directory caching and deblocking
buffers.  The deblocking is done by the BDOS, not the BIOS.  There is a whole
new set of utilities, it will come with RMAC, LINK, LIB, a MP/M-like SET and
SHOW instead of STAT, rename with wildcards, console I/O redirection to/from
disk, lots of other goodies like that.  Most users should wait for their system
suppliers to offer preconfigured systems, unless they have implemented their
own 2.2 BIOS's.  We are finding it increasingly hard to give tech-support to
individuals trying to write BIOS's.

        I guess I could go on for a while, but I mainly know about the
internals of the BDOS-BIOS interface, and not much about the enduser interface
level of the system.  Ask specific questions, I'll try and answer them.

   +++ Remote CP/M Software Exchange Systems, List # 27 +++

                 Last Revised August 28, 1982     

==============================================================
 A   summary of all known (and running) Remote CP/M   Software  
Exchange  Systems  using  XMODEM for  program  transfers.   It   
would  be  appreciated if operators of new RCPM  systems  will 
transmit  the  needed information about their systems  to  Ben  
Bronson  [Hyde Park RCPM  (312) 955-4493], or  to Jud Newell 
[Mississauga RCPM (416) 826-5394].

Ben and Jud will attempt to coordinate updates to the  
RCPMLIST as they occur...

          List # 27 revised and updated courtesy of:

NOTES:

1. Whether  a	program  exchange system is  accessible  by  an 
   a.l.d.s. (= alternative long-distance service) should be con-
   sidered  when  planning  to modem over long programs. Charges 
   on  SPRINT,  ITT/CITYCALL  and  MCI are  50-60% of  Ma Bell's
   regular  long distance rates.

2. Call-back systems are those where a computer and real people 
   share the same telephone line.   To contact the people, just 
   dial  &  let the phone ring until you  get  an  answer.   To 
   contact  the  computer:   (1) dial,	(2) let the phone  ring 
   once, (3) hang up just before the 2nd ring, & (4) re-dial.

3.  Note  that  the  212A/Vadic 1200 Baud modems  may  not  be 
   compatable  with  yours.    Most of the above  systems  are 
   using  Vadic 3451 Triple modems,  compatable with both Bell 
   and Vadic Standard.   Sign on the first time at 300 baud to 
   determine the system capabilities.    Note also that PMMI's 
   can sometimes be used above 300 baud with 1200 baud systems.

Michael,

I like your spell -- I liked 1.0 better (a little).
I'mI'm not sure if this was plannwed, but I discovered
that I could rename spell (1.0() ame spell (1.0) to "spelstar.ovr"
and WS would correctly (apparently) evoke it w/
the "S" at the no-foile menu.  When it returned, there
was a minor glitch due to returning .bak filename,
but no matter.  

However, for all the bugs you mhave fixed in spell 1.1, 
it now refuses to behave properly when renamed,
as above, and evoked from ws a"' la spellstar.

I get an  disk error every time.  However, when
called from cp/m directly, it seems to work just fine.

Query:  can the virtues of 1.1 be retained while
whatever changes are made to permit spell to once
again masquerade as spellstar?ar?  It would be nice.

Also, how difficult is it to augment 1.1 to print
out tehhe word-statisticas at the end of a run?
I
   
I know this is all really nit-picking -- thanks
for a good program.

the error: UNABLE TO FING UNIVERSAL CMD, which
seems to be appropriately fatal.  

I assume that kermit.mac is for the tops-20 and
kermit.asm is for the micro.  What am I missing?
Who should I ask?   Should I care?  (It looks like
a good thing -- file group transfers between micro
and mainframe).

The Applicard is made by PCPI, whose address is:

Personal Computer Products, Inc.
16776 Bernardo Center Drive
San Diego, CA 92128

I spoke with the developers for a little while at a recent
convention. The card is designed to use its own 64k memory and
only communicates with the Apple to do I/O. This allows the CPU
to run at a full 6 MHz, since it is not contending with the
Apple display bus. In fact, they claimed, multiple cards could
be installed in the Apple and run independently. Although
communication with the Apple was only (I think) 40k bytes/sec.,
they did not believe this resulted in any effective loss of
disk access speed on the programs they had tried.

Although I saw the card, I did not see it in operation. I am
also not sure what software is being provided with the card.

	I am involved in a project which hopefully will provide our
computers with the ability to read or write in any disk format.
We have a great need to transfer customer's data from one micro's
diskettes to another's - given any two micro's.
	The BIOS level coding for this is fairly trivial.  On the
lower levels of drive controller coding however, it doesn't appear
so easy.  One must know if the particular micro is using the IBM
3740 single density format, IBM system 34 double density format or
some off-the-wall format of their own.
	Our computerbasically has two drives.  One of which would
be set to one system's format and the other drive to the destination
format.
	The question is, Who uses what controller's in their micros?,
What density(ies)?, What format?, Hard or soft sectored? and how do
they structure the upper levels of their disks (i.e. # tracks, sectors
per track, block sizes, directory sizes, etc...).
	Mainly though, I'm interested in how the disk are formatted
(address fields, data patterns - things never seen by the typical
user).
	Does anyone out there know of a compilation of this type
of information?  Individual input from those who have found this
information through hacking their micros is also very, very welcome!
	Please reply to me directly.  If there is a demand for it, I
will compile the data and make it available on the net.

I have implemented the sort-merge program from Software Tools in C, and
the file is now available as "AR36:CPM;SORT 1C". It has successfully been
used to alphabetize the "SPELL" dictionary of 188K characters. This took
about 15 minutes on my 10-meg hard disk; I suspect it could take anywhere
from a half hour to an hour or so to do it on floppies. Anyway, the thing
was still being debugged two hours ago, and surely has room for performance
improvement. If anyone succeeds in speeding it up a bit, feel free to replace
the file with your faster version. I felt it was important to get it up as
soon as possible, in case there are others like me who'd like to add their
own flagged words to the SPELL dictionary and be able to sort it for use
by DICCRE.
Enjoy,

I have a small quantity (20 or 30) diskettes that were written with a Tarbell
single density controller..  Tarbell (back when I used to use one) had chosen
some sync byte or something in the formatting of sectors that made disks
formatted with this controller unreadable on a 179X controller.  I seem to
remember there being a program that would convert the old formating information
to something that was compatible with the newer double density format..  Can
anyone point me to a solution??  Would be much appreciated.

The 1771 accepted both 00h and FFh for filling interrecord gaps, while
the 179X requires that you use FFh.  If you change the format program
you use to format diskettes on your single-density system to use FFh
for your fill bytes, the diskettes written will be compatible.  Also,
a simpler solution would be to just format a batch of diskettes on the
system with the 179X controller (which must already use the FFh fill
byte) and then copy your old diskettes onto these newly formatted
diskettes.

Before you go to a lot of work, I'd at least try reading some of your
old diskettes with the 179X.  When the incompatiblity was first
discovered, I already had my 1771 system, and went ahead and changed
my FORMAT program.  I would assume that Tarbell then started shipping
out single-density controllers with compatible software.  I would
also assume that any distribution diskette would be compatible,
as I've never had any problem reading such diskettes on my double
density systems.

	I've just uploaded the following programs to AR20:CPM --

CP/M Name	MIT-MC Name	Function
FORMAT2		DJFMT 10MAC	Formats DJ/2D Rev B disks with a few
		DJFMT 10COM		options beyond the FORMT# pgm
SGEN		DJSGEN 13MAC	Sysgens DJ/2D Rev B with a few options
		DJSGEN 13COM		beyond normal SYSGEN

	Since the DJ/2D uses 179x controller chips, these programs
(in source form) may be useful to non-DJ/2D users as well to give
them insight into how to use the 179x and program it.

	One nice option with both FORMAT2 and SGEN is that they support
immediate, non-prompted execution, so that they may be placed in a SUB
file and used without operator intervention.  For instance, FORMAT2 /A4
formats drive A: as format 4 (1024 bytes/block) and SGEN /AB copies the
system from A: to B:.  Additionally, SGEN adds a nice capability of
specifying a CP/M disk file as a destination (as opposed to the OS tracks
of a disk).

	Enjoy!

I'm considering purchasing the DJ 2D/DMA so that I can add an 8" drive
to my system and possibly replace the controller for the 5-1/4" drives
in my N* in the same stroke.  I have some questions before I take the
plunge:

1.  On the surface, it would appear worthwhile to replace the N*
controller with this DMA controller anyway, even if I didn't get the
8" drive.  Is this really worth it?  Should I consider the CompuPro
Disk 1 instead?  Why?

2.  If I go with the Morrow and an 8" drive, it looks like the best
bet is to go ahead and get their DISCUS 2+2/DMA single drive package
which appears to include everything I need.  Should I consider just
getting the controller and, say, a QUME DT-8 or Mitsubishi, and
scrounge for a suitable case, power supply, etc.?

3.  Are there other more worthwhile choices I have not considered?
Any possibilities should include a DMA controller or have I been
oversold by the specs?

Experienced opinions and second-hand hearsay welcome.  If there's
enough interest, I will summarize for the list.

Thanks,

Abstract (extracted from the doc file):

'KERMIT is a set of programs that implement the "KL10 Error-Free
Reciprocol Microcomputer Interchange over TTY-Lines" protocol.  As the
acronym tries to imply, KERMIT allows error-free transfer of files
between computers over normal terminal communication lines.  The
protocol was originally intended for use between microcomputers and
Digital Equipment Corporation DECSYSTEM-20 KL10 processors (hence the
name), but, happily, the protocol will work between any two computers.

'KERMIT transfers data by encapsulating it in "packets" of control
information.  This information includes a synchronization marker, a
packet number to allow detection of lost packets, a length indicator,
and a "checksum" to allow verification of the data.  Lost or corrupt
packets are detected, and retransmission is requested.  In addition,
various special control packets allow cooperating KERMITs to connect
and disconnect from each other and to exchange various kinds of
information.

'The KERMIT manual and all the associated programs are available to
anyone who asks for them'...  'We encourage anyone who develops new
implementations of KERMIT to send them back to Columbia so they can be
included on the standard KERMIT distribution tape; full credit will be
given to all contributors.  In return, we trust that no one who
obtains KERMIT will attempt to put it on the market, claiming it to be
their own.'

--------------------

We will provide a gateway service at MC for updated source files for
either KERMIT-20 or KERMIT-80.  Please send notice of file
availability to me (FJW@MC) and bug reports, etc., to
EIBEN@DEC-MARLBORO, who made these files available from Columbia.

make using SPELL a bit easier: APPEND.C. This takes a small file and appends
it onto another file of any size, using CP/M 2.2x random-record I/O so it
doesn't have to read through the entire destination file. APPEND is useful
for appending onto the end of the SPELL dictionary, of course.

I received the following messages in response to my "letter
quality printer" query.  My conclusions are:

 - the Diablo 630 is very popular; this is probably a combination
   of reasonable price, good functionality, and high reliability;

 - the Fancy Font software package from Pacific Software is very
   interesting.  I have some brochures and print samples about this
   product and I'm impressed.  Apparently, Fancy Font and an Epson
   printer with Graptrax can together print a number of fonts
   in a number of sizes with several variations in facing (e.g.
   regular, bold, italic, etc.).  The "News Release" from Pacific
   software sort of implies that all samples were printed unreduced
   (i.e. the samples were copies of pages which came "straight from the
   presses").  During a phone conversation with Mr. Overman of
   Pacific Software, I believe he said that the "News Release" itself
   had been reduced.  Well, that's probably just a nit.  The package
   can certainly produce beautiful pages using multiple fonts.
   Don't expect to produce voluminous documents in breathtakingly
   exciting olde english font however.  Print speed is advertised
   as about 6 lines per minute.  


Thanks to all who responded to the query.

p.s. My hytype I daisywheeler is back from the shop and I'm $129.55
     lighter.  But -- its worth it.  The old  clunker once again makes
     neat, clean marks on paper.  Maybe I'll stick with it for another
     year.  In any case, I'll certainly order Graftrax ROMs for my

   it in an envelop (or has it printed inside a sealed envelop the
   way bank deposit slips and paychecks are done) and puts postage
   on it (or meters it) and posts it, so I can send mail to

   Jeffrey, My wife has used a nec 7700 printer for about 1 year now
   in our home translating business.  She has typed well over a
   million words in that time frame.  the printer has performed
   flawlessly.  Since the thimbles can take 128 characters it is
   possible to get some fairly versatile print fonts.  As of yet
   however Nec does not produce one that has both a Full roman set
   and enough Greek and scientific characters to be perfect for use
   in all occasions.  At Nrl we also have the two headed Qume top of
   the line printer.  This printer breaks down every month or two
   and its proportional print is poor.  The nec can produce
   excellent copy with a good text writer,e.g.  Vectors memorite
   III, Micropro's wordstar.  So I would go for the NEC over the
   Qume.  I do not know much about the new Diablo.  Joel (NRL 6510)

   Jeffrey,
   
           I noticed you have an Epson printer. That reminded me
   that there is a most interesting new software package that has
   just been introduced called Fancy Font. This set of programs
   takes advantage of the Epson graftrax rom resolution (apparently
   higher than most if not all other printers in its price class) to
   print a variety of typfaces. The author has included a selection
   of several styles of type in each of several sizes (I have a
   preliminary version, so this may differ slightly from what is now
   being offered), a text formatter which handles the dozen or so
   fonts, the Epson standard character sets, justification, margins,
   headers, etc. with both command line options and imbedded
   controls, as well as a program to edit the supplied fonts and one
   to create those of your own. The latter looks like a real big job
   to me, so I think I'll pass on it!
   
           Anyway, the point of all this is that the print quality
   is fantastic. I can't wait for the reaction when I send my next
   memorandum in old English!
   
           The price of Fancy Font is I believe around $180, and in
   my opinion it is well worth it. Source is:

   Sounds like you are as impressed as I was [editor's note: Charlie
   is referring to Fancy Font].  I do not think you
   will be disappointed with the formatter. It allows justification,
   centering, variable margin size, headers, footers, etc., and up
   to ten fonts/document. I am currently playing around with the
   definition of fonts of my own using the Hershey Character set as
   a basis. This looks like a most simple proposition.

   To: Jeffrey at OFFICE-2
   
   Jeffrey,
   
   If you're currently looking at diablo-type printers (and you're
   willing to pay $3-4K), I suggest that you give SanTek (formerly
   Sanders Technology) a call.  They manufacture a "high-density"
   dot-matrix printer which uses a multi-pass technique to produce
   high quality output.  I've been using one recently, and it's
   really a nice unit.
   
   The printer has many features worth mentioning.  First of all,
   the key to the flexibility of the printer is that it accepts up
   to six ROM cartridges (similar to the Atari Game Cartridges),
   each one containing either one or two fonts.  By sending the
   printer commands (it has lots of them), you can switch between
   fonts, etc.  It sure beats changing Daisywheels.
   
   Another very useful feature of the printer is that it has
   different print qualities (which is does by changing the number
   of passes per line). When preparing drafts, you can use the draft
   ("Epson") quality which in itself looks pretty good.  The nice
   thing about this is that the printer zips along at over 300 cps
   bidirectional.  The highest quality output is printed at about 75
   cps or so, which blows away Diablos.  There are also intermediate
   quality settings which require less time to print.  All of this
   is also under software control.
   
   As far as fonts go, SanTek has a catalog which has everything
   from Helvetica to Cyrillic to Hebrew, as well as Presentation
   Fonts, Greek/Math Fonts, etc. They also have a dot-plot ROM to so
   that one can turn out graphs and charts.
   
   The printer lists for about $4K which is much more cost effective
   than the double daisywheel diablo.  The only drawback of the
   printer is that it is not the most quiet printer I've seen.  Then
   again, for 300+ cps, I can tolerate a bit of noise.  Hope this
   helps out...

   Well - there are lots of printers available.  Since you already
   have an EPSON that tells me that you don't want something really
   expense like a Sanders or Malibu - and that you don't need a dual
   mode printer. Diablo and QUME are probably the most popular with
   the Diablo being my preference BUT there is another one on the
   market which lists for half the price of the Diablo - it is the
   Daisywritter.  This nice machine sells for $1495.00 with a 48K
   buffer and $1095 with a 16K buffer(I think). The actual print
   speed is 30 cps BUT it has a fast slew rate of 200 cps, which is
   used for 1 to n spaces...effectively giving it a throughput of 50
   - 90 cps for average letters..the Diablo 16xx print at 55 cps
   max. Better yet with the 48K buffer which can be downloaded in
   approx. 30 secs. the printer will continue to print for about 30
   min....leaving your machine free to do what it will.  If this
   isn't enough there is one more capability...it handles all of the
   Diablo/Qume/Centronics data protocols as well as having 4(not 1)
   interfaces: IEE 488, Serial, Centronics Parallel, and I forgot
   what the fourth one is.  You don't pay extra for these --- it
   comes with all 4.  Sounds like this would get you the most for
   your money as well as doing the job you need to get done.  If
   your requirements are not what I assumed let me know and I'll see
   if there isn't something around to fill them.

   I got mine (2) [editor's note, Jim is referring to a Diablo

   chips in sockets F23 and F32. You might be able to save $$s by
   buying a 630 w/o these chips initially.  They make the 630 "too

   We use a Diablo 630 with excellent results.  These are not as
   reliable as the older Diablos (e.g. 1650) but are much less
   expensive.  If you get a non-630 Diablo, just be sure it uses
   metal printwheels -- the plastic ones wear out too fast.
   
   If you really feel extravagant you can buy a Wang/Diablo on the
   surplus market (I can get you one for $2800 but you probably want
   to buy it out in CA) and a Morrow Mult I/O (by far the best S-100
   card for controlling one of these).  A friend of mine has had one
   of these for three years, and except for when he plugged the
   interface in backwards, @i<nothing> has ever gone wrong with it

I have been using the DJ2D, Rev. B for about a year and a half, along
with their disk drives.  The drives are nothing special, but if you
sanity (rather than dollars) is an issue, I would strongly
suggest getting the set of the controller and drives.  I have had very
little problems with the DJ itself.  The only thing that has bugged
me is the DMA addressed prom, located at E000.  I had to order another
prom up at F800 (there not easy to burn yourself).  The DJ uses up
2K at the top of memory, plus, if memory serves me correctly, another
2K in transient space as a buffer area.  I am really running a 58K
system instead of a 60K.  If this will cause any problem with you, I
would not suggest buying the board.  I did, at one time, attempt to 
use the bank select feature to cause the disk DMA and prom to be in
another bank, along with the buffer space.  It was a "forever" project
and I gave up.  As for the operation of the DJ, it is nice and fast,
relatively bug free, and as I stated previously, has given me very little
hassle in a year and a half of full time use (average of 7 hours daily).

If you have other specific questions, feel free to ask

For those of you interested in running NorthStar BASIC under CP/M, I

package which now supports N*BASIC 5.2.

The files are in MC:AR47:CPM; as:

NS2CPM DOC      8K  CRC:F99CH

NS2CPM 59ASM   22K  CRC:19E4H

I have not used this conversion, so I cannot attest to its

The RBBS (Remote Bulletin Board System - CBBS in BASIC) files formerly
in AR63:CPM; on MC have been moved to a new AR69:CPM;.

I have also uploaded to that new AR, a new version of RBBS, which
includes many bug fixes and new features that I've been dying for
someone to include ever since I first saw the program.  I would have
added more, but I ran out of TPA space... Unless you have at least a
54K TPA or access to PLINKII, don't bother with this version if you
want to make a .COM file out of it.  (The resulting .COM file is 38K.)

The new files are:

MC:CPM;AR69:
     MENU   RBBS    - name it MENURBBS on your system
     NEWCOM 1       - name it NEWCOM on your system
     RBBS   30ASC   - ASCII source of RBBS 3.0
     RBBS   30DOC   - a brief doc file to get started

If you want to try it out, call our APPLE RCP/M system anytime (300
baud only), no ringback nonsense, at 915-533-2202 in El Paso, TX.

For me, one of the annoying things  about my CP/M is its inability to
print  while  I  do other  things.   I've  tried  despool  with  poor
results.  I much rather have a true multi-programmed system  such  as
Unix or concurrent CP/M, etc. 

But - by now I've have a substantial investment in not changing.  Its
not so much the price of the software or hardware; its more  the time
I've spent tailoring programs, command files,  procedure, etc.  to do
things just the way I like. 

I'm therefore interested in a  print  spooling  mechanism which I can
add to my Godbout 8085/88 S100 system. 

The easiest solution seemed to involve the  acquisition  ($150 or so)
of a 16k buffer to fit inside my Epson MX80.

Well, that seemed simple.  When installed in my printer,  the  buffer
didn't work.   It  worked  at the shop however.  After wasting a good
deal of time, I came to learn that my  Godbout interfacer II parallel
port is not really what an Epson want to see.   I've  just been lucky
that it drives  the  printer  at  normal speed (i.e. printer speed). 
Addition of the buffer increased the data transfer rates so much that
data would no longer transfer.  End of buffer idea.  Of course I soon
thereafter  bought  Godbout's  Interfacer  IV  board  with  a  "true"
centronics parallel port. 

In the meantime, however, I've become interested  in  doing the thing
"right". I first thought that maybe the  8088 could despool from some
extra memory while the 8085 listened to me.  No such luck.  Godbout's
8085/88 dual  processor  board is constructed so that only one of the
processors may be active at once. 

Now, I'm sort of thinking that it  might  be  nice  to  have  a slave
processor on  the  S100  bus.  This processor might be able to handle
one or more of the following tasks. 

  -  buffer printer output and despool it  to any printer (I've got a
     daisywheel as well as the Epson).

  -  spool information coming across my modem to my micro (i.e. catch
     a long file in a local buffer). 

  -  despool information from my micro  to  the  modem (i.e. buffer a
     file from my system to  a  buffer  and  then despool that to the
     modem. 

I  know  this  technique  will  involve   more  expense  than  simply
purchasing an outboard  buffering  device.   It also, however, sounds
like more fun and more flexible.  Using this sort of scheme, I should
be  able  to  cancel  printing  from  my  keyboard  (by  sending  the
appropriate  message to the despooler).  Outboard despoolers  usually
require a mechanical reset to clear printing. 

Has anyone built such a despooler? 

Does anyone have any comments about any of the  available  S100  SBCs
(single board computers) which might be applicable?  I suppose
that I'll want to have a "slave" processor as my despooler
so that it doesn't put memory requests (and the like) out on the bus.

Hello,

  Does anybody (or everybody) know if CP/M makes any use of the s1, s2,
and cr fields of the FCB in the disk directory.  I know what the fields
are used for in the in-core copy of the FCB, but is there any reason they
can't be used for a 'date-last-modified' field on disk?

  Thanks for your time,

I think that the idea of building a print spooler is not
necessarily the most expedient thing in the world.  If
you've got the money, and the time for a toy project, though,
it might be fun.

Have you tried the public domain UNSPOOL program available somewhere
in MC:CPM;?  IT is a rather nice unspooler I have seen working
on other systems.  It does, however require something unusual in
the LSTSTAT bios call.  I have tried it with my LSTSTAT on the
Morrow system with no luck at all (and the LSTSTAT works.)
Good luck with it.  I would play with UNSPOOL first.

Some interesting observations and just a little raving:

For the past few weeks, I have been trying to write a program
that will take a 2k, properly orged image and place it on
track 0, CCP sectors.  That's not all that difficult.  What's
difficult is trying to make it run on machine to machine.
But, sayest thou, CP/M is "the software buss".  Thou repeatest with,
all you need is to get information on the disk parameters and use
that.

WRONGO, MAN WITH FLAT FINGERS....Argh!!!

CP/M will allow you to get back a disk parameter header and 
thereby a pointer to the disk parameter block through the SELDSK
bios call.  Well, the disk parameter block (DPB) describes the disk,
right?  Uh uh, no way Jose.  The DPB describes MOST of the disk,
however, HOWEVER, many manufacturers tend to make track 0 
different from other tracks.  They make other tracks double
density, but track 0 single density, or vice versa, or with
cheese on top.  Nevertheless, they make track 0 with different
parameters than the rest of the disk.  The SELDSK DPB does
not necessarily describe track 0.  But, you say, doesn't
SYSGEN know how to access track zero.  I mean, it DOES
access track zippo. Ah well, you see OEM's purchase an OEM
license for CP/M and get the source for SYSGEN.  

AND THEN THEY MODIFY THE THING, OR REWRITE IT.

See, I thought, well, maybe, just maybe, I could check the
parameters in SYSGEN to see what track zilch is made of, you
know, sugar and spice and everything nice.  Well, I could,
on about 50% of the systems out.  Another 50% have totally
rewritten SYSGEN.  Well, I could patch MOVCPM, thought your
perilous writer.  But noooOOOOOooooOOOOOo....more than 50%
of the OEM's diddle with MOVCPM, or don't even include it.

So it's like this...if you modify track zero stuff, beware...
you will not be able to make it thoroughly portable.

I spoke to Digital Research about this, and they know about
it, but can't do a whole lot.

Argh...<<growl>>...Argh!!!!

(End Rave)

Thank you for listening, this time until next time.

I would suggest that you look at Magnolia Micro Systems for
disk systems for your Z/H89. I have upgraded a friend's H89
using Magnolia stuff and the hardware has always worked and the
manuals were always accurate and easy to read. And usually, 
the installation of anything from them has worked the first
time. HOWEVER, although thier stuff has been good, I have noticed
that generally, their system with 8" shugart disks is rather
slow. I have not had time to figure out why; if it is the type
of disks (I have the step rate set to the fastest possible of
their version of CP/M) or what. If you are looking for performance,
look someplace else, if you want ease of use/upgrade/etc, they
are pretty good.

This is in response to a correspondent who would like to use the S1,
S2, and CR fields of a CP/M disk directory entry to record a file
date/time stamp.
  S2 holds the overflow bits from the extent number.  Under CP/M v1,
extent numbers were five-bit entities and are shoe-horned into the
low five bits of the EX byte.  With CP/M v2, extent numbers are lengthened,
with bits 5 and up (least significant is bit 0) stored in S2.
  The disk directory entry contains only 32 bytes, not 36 bytes as a
File Control Block does.  The CR field, the 33'rd byte, isn't stored.
  I haven't yet found a purpose for S1.  Does anyone know?

I need a good memory test.  I know there are some running around,
but I'm not sure which is which.  I need a good one for
dynamic RAMs.  If there are any other system robustness tests,
I would really appreciate knowing.

Thanks.

You need BRAINWASH!  It's the best memory test I have ever seen for
z80s running CP/M and whatever type of memory.  As far as I know,
it has never failed to find a bad or even slightly slow chip.

I've had my TeleVideo 950 terminal since April 1981.

My reasons for choosing the 950 were primarily three:

	- the displayed image is very clear and stable
	  (no waviness).

	- the keyboard is separate from the display

	- it has 11 (22 if you count shifts) PROGRAMMABLE
	  function keys

I knew the 950 had lots of features, but I hadn't started using
them until recently.

I found out that for about $9.50, I could purchase a 8x2k RAM
chip which gives the 950 another "page" of memory. This is quite
handy.  When I have something on the screen which I want to refer
to later, I simply switch to the alternate page.  Later, when I
need to look at the saved screen, I simply switch back.    I find
this very useful for temporarily saving compiler error messages.
Then when I'm in the editor looking to fix things up, I refer
back to the saved screen image.  I save this image until I've
looked at all the areas corresponding to problems.  I've
programmed one of my function keys to do the switching.  Each
time I hit F11, the other page of memory is displayed and used if
information is written to the screen.

Rick Conn's TVI950 configuration program taught me how to program
a function key so that its action is local (to the terminal)
rather than causing characters to go to the host (my CP/M
system).  This is how I've programmed my F11 function key.

I've tailored Mark of the Unicorn's Mince a little and have
established some of the two key commands on the remainder of my
function keys.

Using the SYNONYM utility, I've created a COM file (950.COM)
whose effect is equivalent to the CP/M command:  TYPE 950.SAV   .
I've created the file 950.SAV to contain the terminal commands
which load all of my function keys and perform other terminal
initialization.

I recently modified my BIOS so that at the end of each coldstart,
the command 950 is executed.  This runs 950.COM which types
950.SAV which configures my function keys and other terminal
characteristics.

Yesterday, I was thinking about the 950's SEND key.  I read my
950 manual and found out that the SEND command could be initiated
from the host system.

I now have built a program which when invoked, causes the
terminal to SEND back the entire screen image which is being
displayed. The resultant characters are stored in a file or
printed to lst: .

This may be slightly useful or may not; time will tell. I guess
it will help when I want to catch (in a file) some sample
dialogue which isn't more than a screenful or two (I can
configure the terminal as 2 - 24 line pages or a single 48 line
page).

One nice thing about having the terminal send back its content is
that the terminal is a REALLY separate machine. It doesn't know
or care about coldstarts, control-zilches, or any other special
thing which may effect the host.  Distributed processing is
powerful.

I guess the point of all this jawboneing is that many terminals
have a lot of logic just waiting for a chance to work.  Its
probably worth a look at your terminal manual to find out what's
out there.

If anyone would like the source to the program which captures the
screen image from TVI950, send me a request.  Its written in BDS
C.

memory test for what??? 8080? z80? 8085? different
processors put different constraints on their dynamic rams.
my system is a z80 and when I upgraded my 2 Mhz cpu to 4 Mhz, 
my "memory test" (supplied in my monitor provided my SD Systems)
said that my memory Worked Perfectly. But for some reason, My
system would no longer boot. It might sometimes do a partial boot 
before croaking or once in a while, it might even get to the cpm
login message before dying. Came to find out later, after several
fistfuls of hair, that the instruct fetch and data fetch cycles for
a z80 were not the same length. instruction fetches were faster (beats
me why) so while normal memory tests might work, the placing of 
accual code in that memory and then jumping to it might not.
so, now ask, what kind of memory test do ya want now?

	Yes! I'd like the c-code for the 950 terminal features you've
developed, for modification to an h19.  Your function-key alternatives 
for mince also sound good.

helpful, and will be forwarding to Amethyst-Users shortly.  Here is the
first installment:

/* windows for AUG */
MBeginWind()	/* on  M-, */	
{
	BPntToMrk(sstart);
	TForce();
	}
MEndWind()	/* on M-. */
{
	BPntToMrk(send);
	BMove(-1);
	TForce();
	}
MMoveToTop()	/* 'M-!' ==> line to top of buffer */
{
 	tmp=prefrow;
	prefrow=0;
	ScrnRange();
	prefrow=tmp;
	ToBegLine();

as to whether or not Motorola did indeed announce CP/M-68K.  The press
release says that they will, but DRI is quoting BOTH Sept. 15 and Dec
15th for release dates!  Confusion.

Different subject.  Surely I am not the only person to try to install

I've assembled //IF and //SKIP (using MAC) previously announced
by Charlie Strom <CSTROM @ MC>.   they are very useful utilities which
enable conditional execution within submit files.  They work
by evaluating conditions which you specify (on //IF invocations)
and then gobbling one or more statements out of $$$.SUB if
the conditions are met (or not met).

Conditions include some character string matching (e.g. does $1
equal "abc...") and a good deal of filename testing (e.g.
$1.ASM  is/is-not ambiguous , or $2.$3 exists).

Very nice.

Yes... standardization would be nice, but not just with track 0!  I think
a much greater problem is the lack of standardization on entire diskettes.
The only "standard" format is the 8" single-density format that Digital
Research (and others) distribute their software in.  If you have 5 1/4" or
double density 8" you can just about give up on being able to easily give
your disks to the guy down the block who has a CP/M system from a different
vendor.  It would have been nice if Digital Research would have stepped in
when OEMs started developing 8" double density and 5 1/4" systems and
define some sort of standard for them as well.  Or if we want a hundred
different flavors so each OEM can do their own thing, we could have defined
the end of track 0 sector 1 (or some *STANDARD* place) to contain a copy
of the disk parameter and sector translate tables to use when reading that
diskette.  Everyone's BIOS could then have a log-in procedure, and everyone
could read everyone else's diskettes.  Wouldn't that be nice?

I just saw the propaganda from the Softcrafts people concerning their Fancy
Fonts package.  It is as nice as everybody says it is. In fact, the typeface
database that comes with it is worth the asking price.

However - the formatter that it comes with seems to be a lossage. Well, it
doesn't look like what I'm used to (scribble), and is noticeably less powerful.
The fix would seem to be some sort of preprocessor.

So: does somebody out there have a CP/M based macro processor that can
be made to turn something that looks like scribe into something that
looks like nroff? Does somebody have a Fancy Fonts -> scribble preprocessor?
Is somebody working on one of the two?

Now, for the reason this went (I hope) to unix-wizards: I remember seeing
several people looking for scribe -> troff translators. This would seem to be
close to what I want. Is the source to such a beast available?

	thanx,

This system is available for public, justified use.  Kindly
refrain from profanity.  This could spell network suicide
when mailing to hundreds of people.  It is also not
appreciated.

Glad you are pleased with the //if-//skip files. I am not, however the
author; rather the credit belongs to Gary Novosielski, one of the more
creative people I have the pleasure of interacting with on
Compuserve's CP/M special interest group (its called CP-MIG). I try to
channel the most interesting original software developed there to MC
and thus through the net.
I will, however, forward your comments to Gary for his consideration.
Thanks for the suggestions.

I have a real need for these 3 programs (CAT/UCAT/FMAP) on my Superbrain,
which is actuall a Superfive, with one floppy plus a hard disk.

FMAP works on the Superbrain, and CAT seems to assemble okay, but UCAT.ASM
requires MAC, which I do not have.

Does anyone have a .COM version of UCAT, that might work on the SB, or a
suggestion as to how I may get it to assemble for a MICRO on a TENEX
host?

Any help appreciated.

Is there a program which is similar to UNLOAD but processes
arbitrary files?

I assume it would decompose an arbitrary file to a string of
printable characters.  There would also need to be an inverse
function to recompose the original file from the decomposition
(i.e. the printable representation).

One use for such a program (and its partner) would be to
facilitate transmission of files where tools like
MODEM were inappropriate.

If I were spec'ing such a tools I would consider:

   - compression (maybe by simply doing some special processing
     on repeated strings of length one or two).

   - validity checks (probably would want to include a checksum
     as the last line of the printable format version;  this
     would be checked by the reconstituter).


If there are interesting answers, I'll publish to the group.

By the way, one of my previous querys asked about despooler
boards for the S100.  I received a number of responses - all but
one response just wanted to receive my responses.  One respondant
suggested that Sierra Data Sciences S100 slave board wa worth looking
into.  For the moment, I'm going to let that one slide.
Its a big project if i start from scratch.

mainly because I'm lazy about learning it. Somebody offered to lead me
by the hand on the system, and even to provide a free account where
I could upload neat C stuff and not have it cost me anything. Is that

One of the responses to my printer query earlier this month
described a package called Fancy Font from SoftCraft
(8726 S. Sepulveda Blvd, Suite 1641, Los Angeles, CA 90045,
213-641-3822).

Fancy Font is billed as a "Personal Typesetter" which prints
on an Epson printer which is equipped with the Epson
GrafTraks option.

After seeing some very impressive page copies, I decided to
plunk down my $180 for the Fancy Font formatter/print program,
the font creation and edit programs, and the various font
and character tables which come with the package.

It arrived today and so did the Graftak ROMs.  I had my 
usual amount of trouble installing the ROMs (I wasn't
real good as a 1401 operator either).  Eventually, the ROMs
were installed and the printer worked as it had before mangling.

Next I brought up the Fancy Font print program and it printed
out one of my recent letters in Olde18 font (Old English style -
18 points high).  Its really nice.  The print quality on my
MX80 is about the same as that of Knuth's Tex and Metafont
book - which means that it looks very good but under close
inspection (eyeballing) is a little raggety.  In any case, for
a $525 printer, its fantastic.

You wont be printing books however, since the print speed is
quite slow (advertised at about 6 lines per minute).

Nonetheless, Fancy Font is terrific in my opinion.  The
package includes about 30 font sets (5 or 6 basic styles
in a number of different sizes and faces) as well as a large
table of characters from which new fonts may be built .

The most impressive feature (once you get over the idea that
your little MX80 can typeset) is Fancy Font's ability to
accept new characters.

You can hand fancy font a text file which contains an image
made "drawn" from asterisks.  Each asterisk represents
a point on a grid which is up to 216 x 120 .  Using
Efont (the font editor), you associate the image with
an ASCII code (0-127).  Then to invoke that image at
print time, simply include the character corresponding to
the code in the text file which you print.  


The following image generates a (vertically compressed
"character" which is aobut 5/8 of an inch high.  The
maximum size character is about one inch square.

*****    ******
 
 
 
 
 
When printed, the "A" looks much more graceful due to
compression in the vertical plane.


I think that Fancy Font is a little bit revolutionary
and deserves attention.

One of Digital Resarch's local representatives (they have
a Palo Alto sales office) offered some information about
CP/M 3.0.  Its probably old hat to many, but was
interesting to me.

  - CP/M 3.0 should be released by the end of the year.
  - the primary improvements are in disk file processing
    speed (7 fold improvement suggested)
  - the system is menu oriented and has improved error
    messages and prompts
  - 100% program and file compatibility with CP/M version 2
    was claimed


DR will supposedly soon also release four new graphics products -
two for ISV's and two for end users.

The representative also indicated that DR would have a number
of announcements at Comdex.  He indicated that the announced products
would be very interesting and ready for pretty much immediate
shipment.

I just visited a local computer garage sale and came back with two
new toys, completely devoid of documentation, specs, or any
proof that they work.  But the price was very right.

Anyway, these devices are two 1200 baud modems, a Novation
4000 series 4202B and Ma Bell dataphone 1800.  The Bell is
actually two boxes, the Dataphone 1800, which has two DB25's
on the back and says "P/O data set 202T type", and another box,
the dataphone channel interface which has one of those multi-
extension phone jobbies on the back and says "series 1 data
mounting".

My goal is to get one of these modems running as a normal 1200
baud modem.  I would guess the Bell machine is auto-dial,
or auto answer at least.  I've no idea about the novation.

I need information about these things.  I would like
basic functional specs, as well as (please, oh please)
documentation so that I can bring these things up.

If you've got docs, or know where I can get them (without
a three month delay time), please let me know.  I am
willing to pay copying charges and postage for them.

If you can help, let me know and I'll give you my 
US Mail address and my blessing.

Thanks in advance,

David

PS:  for those on both lists, sorry.  This probably should
even go to another list on modems, but I'm not sure if there
is such a thing.

Again, thanks.


PPS: By the way, for those who are into "property of Bell" stuff,
there is no such message anywhere, either inside or outside the
boxes, on the PC board, or elsewhere.  I figured that it wouldn't
be wrong to have them this way.

This is an "open letter" to all manufacturers of S-100
hard disk systems.

I am looking for a sponsor for the Royal Oak Remote CP/M
(RCPM) system.  This is an ideal chance for you to spotlight
your product where potential customers can get a first-hand
look at how it performs.

What I am proposing is this:  Send me one of your hard
disk systems (with S-100 controller), which I will put
on-line as the Royal Oak RCPM system.  You will remain
the sole owner of the equipment.  Your only obligation
will be to provide maintenance and operation costs for
the system.  In exchange, you will get an on-line
courtesy message that each caller will see everytime
he calls the system.  You will also receive feedback from
me on any bugs/modifications/improvements I come up with
as a result of my hands-on experience with your equipment.

Motorola did indeed announce CP/M-68K at Wescon, but indicated it wouldn't
be available 'till around the end of the year.  They didn't have it running
at the show.

More interesting to me was their announcement of UNIDOS, which they did have
running, and was to be Beta-sited in a couple of months, and generally
available shortly(?) thereafter.  UNIDOS is a UNIX look-alike.  Does anyone
know if this was an inhouse creation, or if not, whose UNIX look-alike it is?

They didn't have literature available for either, preferring to mail out
literature after the show, so I will wait and see some of the details when
that arrives.  Something that really bothered me about Wescon was the lack
of the plastic bags to carry literature around in.  Quite a few people did
have them, which I assume they brought with them, since I didn't locate
anyone handing them out.  However, if you got on the bus at Wescon to go
over to the Disneyland Hotel to see the Mini/Micro con, there were large
signs at the entrances stating "NO SHOPPING BAGS", and people turning you
back if you tried to enter with anything more than an armload of literature.

I have a real need for these 3 programs (CAT/UCAT/FMAP) on my Superbrain,
which is actuall a Superfive, with one floppy plus a hard disk.

FMAP works on the Superbrain, and CAT seems to assemble okay, but UCAT.ASM
requires MAC, which I do not have.

Does anyone have a .COM version of UCAT, that might work on the SB, or a
suggestion as to how I may get it to assemble for a MICRO on a TENEX
host?

Any help appreciated.

I've used a Decision I with 256K RAM, a 10MB Winchester and 1 floppy
running an early version of Micronix.  Micronix is a fair facsimile
of Unix ver 6, but extremely slow.  The CP/M emulator is even slower;
practically unuseable.  I would estimate it runs at about 20%-25% the
speed of native CP/M.  You set up Unix directories which appear as
logical drives to the CP/M emulator.  This is a nice setup except that
the file structure is not CP/M compatible.  You cannot read a CP/M disk
under the emulator.  You must first run a utility that will convert the
files/programs you wish to use to Micronix format, and then run them
under upm (the CP/M emulator).

The system is much more pleasant to use in "Unix mode", but still
annoyingly slow.  I just don't think a Z80 can hack a Unix type
operating system.

In all fairness to Morrow, it was a preliminary release of Micronix
I used.  They claim the performance of the current version has been
improved dramatically.  Some new ROMS and other minor hardware mods
are included in the new version to beef up performance.  Also, from
a hardware standpoint, I really like the Decision I.  I've been
using a 64K CP/M setup for a couple of months, and it's been 100%
solid.

MDBS is an excelent data base management system, and is available for CP/M
as well as for Unix.  I don't have their address off hand, but they regularly
take out full page adds near the front in Byte.  A little expensive, but
one heck of a dbms!

My contact at D.R. told us that CP/M 3.0 would be released initially
to OEM's only. The date as of a couple of weeks ago was Sept. 26
(since that is a Sunday, obviously it is close but no cigar!) Version
3 will NOT be 100% compatible with 2.2 on the application level; the
BDOS rather than the BIOS will be responsible for deblocking; programs
such as DU that do disk diddling through the BIOS will surely not
operate properly.
Incidentally, there is no real release date to us poor mortals; my
friend told me the documentation is sketchy at best; this coupled with
the desire by DR not to end up doing a lot of hand-holding to end
users trying to do the BIOS conversion will certainly make them drag
their feet a while. I bet the comment re documentation will cause more
than a few chuckles by those reading this!

For those unfamiliar with EX, it is a very enhanced replacement for SUBMIT

UNLOAD does almost what you want.  You simply REName the subject file
to fn.COM, run UNLOAD on it to produce fn.HEX, transmit it to the
other end, LOAD it (automatic checksum checking is built-in), and
REName the resulting fn.COM back to the original name.

While using SWEEP v3.6, I found a minor bug.  If you try to copy or mass-copy
a file with verification, and the file is empty (i.e. 0K long), SWEEP hangs
up.  After resetting my system, it seems that SWEEP created the directory
entry of the file on the destination diskette, and got hung in the 
verification routine.  This was confirmed, as SWEEP works fine when copying
0K files without verification.  Have others experienced this problem?

The bounce of large-list mail, such as to INFO-CPM and INFO-MICRO, via

Lauren,

Here is the message I promised a long time ago.  As you may remember, a
couple of years ago I purchased a copy of OS-1, another Unix-on-a-Z80,
from Electro/Software Labs.  I was able to get it running on my system
and spent a fair amount of time studying the manuals.  This message is
a synopsis of some of the critical gaps in OS-1 that I hope MARC fixes.
I won't touch upon E/S Labs as an organization or their customer
service.  I'm sending this to the whole list because I think others may
be interested in developing custom operating systems or may have ideas
about how to handle some of the problems.

There are only two areas that I feel are crucial, namely booting and
customization for disk formats other than 8" SSSD.

Booting OS-1 was similar to booting UCSD Pascal from CP/M: you first
booted CP/M; then you ran something such as BOOTER.COM; it asked for
the name of a drive from which to boot the OS-1 system disk; you
inserted the diskette and typed a return; and after a minute or so of
disk churning, OS-1 would appear.

Obviously this was something of an ordeal.  I'd be willing to bet that
most CP/M users hit the boot switch pretty frequently during a given
session of hacking.  One reason for this is to guarantee a fresh copy
of everything, resetting the system to a known state.  Another is that
you might be testing a program that has gone to meet its maker in the
infinite loop in the sky.  Any C programmer can recount with grief the
story about the dynamically allocated block that got away.  I really
really hope that it will be possible to boot MARC from the system tracks
on the disk, rather than go thru a multi-stage liftoff.  It seems to
me that it should be possible to stitch a copy of the booter along
with a standard CP/M BIOS into the SYSGEN image, probably on top of
where the BDOS would otherwise reside.  This should enable anyone with
SYSGEN to create a bootable version of MARC.

The second problem with OS-1 was that it had a CP/M 1.4 mentality.
That is, it assumed that your BIOS was only capable of dealing with
8" SSSD soft-sectored disks.  This can be very frustrating when your
system disk contains space for 64 inodes, 62 of which are jammed with
all of the useful utilities that are needed to repair broken heirarchical
file systems, manage user groups, etc, and you know that your disks
can handle four times that amount of space.  So...I really really hope
that MARC can make use of a CP/M 2.x BIOS.  It seems to me that the
CP/M 2.x BIOS design provides a reasonable paradigm for device-independent
access to any type of disk drive, and it is obviously a standard.
Heirarchical filesystems really shine when you have 10 megabytes worth
of files to organize; it would be a shame not to take advantage of
the existing 2.x BIOS.  How many people are still running 1.4 BIOSes?

A third area that I feel strongly about, although I believe it's not
as crucial as the above, is the provision of a standard display control
paradigm.  CP/M provides an implied virtual terminal, which is the
ASR-33.  (I'm stretching it.  The CP/M virtual terminal might have
Backspace, and it probably has lower case, but it doesn't need either.)
We're all used to watching our friends with Apples and IBM PC's run
their display-oriented menus and graphics.  It's a shame that CP/M
doesn't provide a standardized set of primitives to get at the CRT
that is connected to 95% of the consoles, so that all of the public
domain software could do neater things.  I know that recent software
products such as WordStar and Mince take care of this problem with
a configuration program; and if MARC follows the Unix world view,
it will probably use a Termcap data base with an elaborate display
library.

I'd like to suggest an alternative.  Provide a minimum set of display
control primitives (definitely putchar, gotoxy, clrscreen; maybe
clr-to-eol; probably not ins/del line/char).  Have a standardized way
of invoking these primitives from C, hopefully in such a way that the
primitives can be imbedded in strings and be transmitted with printf().
Then interpret the special commands in the BIOS.  One method would be
to set the sign bit on any byte containing a display command, which the
extended BIOS would notice and process seperately; all other characters
would be output just as always.  I'd bet that gotoxy, clrscreen, and
clr-to-eol would add about 30 bytes to my BIOS.  A linkable library
of screen-control functions could instead be bound into each program,
but that presumes you get the source to everything, or at least the
relocatable objects.  My proposal allows distribution of display-oriented
software in binary form.

Well, that's enough on OS-1 and CP/M for now.  I hope you'll say
that it's already implemented.

to the Timex/Sinclair 1000/ZX80/ZX81.  Send requests to be added to
the list to INFO-ZX-REQUEST@CMU-20C.  Send submissions to
INFO-ZX@CMU-20C.  The list will be an immediate distribution list as
long as the volume of traffic doesn't bother other CMUC users.
Messages will be archived in [CMUC]PS:<ZX>ZX.MESSAGES.

Users may submit programs for others to share by FTPing them into
[CMU-20C]PS:<ZX.PROG> using user anonymous.  This will probably not
be too useful until modems for the Sinclair are readily available.

Thanks for your comments.  I can address your points as they reflect
on the current state of the software...

1) Booting.  No matter what you do, booting is a difficult problem.
   I've spent alot of time looking at this issue, and
   so far have found no "universal" way of allowing users to patch a 
   bootable image into their system tracks -- particularly when they
   have other than single-density 8 inch disks.  There are just too
   many variations.  Yeah, given alot of implementation info and a
   wizard, it could be done for any given system, but I don't see how
   to automate the process.  I have the code here for a coldstart MARC
   loader that does part of the work... but it's not enough.  Frankly,
   I can't see spending much more time on this issue until I'm sure
   that the parasitically booting version comes up on everyone's machines!
   There are so many variations that coming up with *anything* that can
   boot *somehow* has been enough work.  Once I see how the initial
   MARC does in mass distribution, I can start worrying about cold
   booting again.  One thing at a time.

   By the way, the MARC boot program, called MBOOT, allows the user to
   customize (with SID or DDT) for default selections of root device,
   reserved memory, and a bunch of other parameters.  These can all
   be overridden by command line options, of course.  MARC takes
   considerable pains to make rebooting a rarity unless you manage
   to totally wipe out the kernel... all "obvious" parameters such
   as pseudo-interrupt traps, control-chars, and the like are reset whenever
   a program terminates (or at user logoff, as appropriate).


2) CP/M 1.4 vs. CP/M 2.X.  No worries there.  I have finally dropped support
   for 1.4 systems and MARC now assumes a 2.X-type system for all operations. 
   Since it derives all its info from the disk parameter tables and uses
   seldsk for disk operations, it should work properly on all legit
   BIOSes.  I know that it has come up under several complex hard disk/floppy
   bioses without any difficulty, and with no "customizing" in the usual 
   sense.  The CP/M emulator attempts to handle all "reasonable" calls to
   the CP/M 2.X type functions.  There are a couple that don't make sense
   in the MARC environment but very few programs ever use them anyway.
   There are some limitations on file size and such under the emulator, but
   these should not normally be of any concern.  The emulator is not
   perfect, but it tries.

3) Display support.  As far as I'm concerned, this does not belong in the
   operating system.  A Berkeley termcap type system would be nice, but
   I sure don't have the time for it now... particularly since no existing
   programs would be using it!  Such an item might be added to Leor's
   wish list of things to add to BDS C generally, but I don't think it
   should be MARC specific.  MARC does have a stty option for console
   type that could be used in conjunction with such a feature if it
   ever appeared.  Maybe some nice info-cpm reader will take it upon
   him/herself to write such a package.  Berkeley termcap is public
   domain, but is rather large.  Any individual effort should at least be
   able to make use of the existing Berkeley /etc/termcap database and
   should be compatible with the formats in that database.

That's about it.  Frankly, my biggest concern now is regarding CP/M 3.0.
I have a sneaky hunch that support for MARC under 3.0 may be difficult
or perhaps impossible.  Concepts such as the disk deblocking being in
the BDOS would make life incredibly difficult, as would the other
inherent kludginess for bank switching and the like that I assume will
be in there.  No doubt that's why they're only releasing to OEM's now --
they figure it will only be useful in "packaged" systems where the
configuration is carefully controlled.  If everyone decides to jump
on the 3.0 bandwagon, I will have to decide if it makes any sense to
try push MARC at all when it depends on 2.X systems.  If large numbers of
people punt 3.0 and stay with 2.X, then the problems will not be
so severe.  I would appreciate any comments from people who have some
feelings about how much impact CP/M 3.0 is actually going to have.
I fear that a new era of incompatibility is about to emerge... with some
programs demanding bank switching for large TPA's, and others being
capable of running in both 2.X and 3.0 environments.  I have no idea how
it's going to turn out.

 I am interested in compiling a list of implementations of Ward
Christenson's MODEM or XMODEM program under various operating
systems. If such a thing exists, could someone please point me to it.
If not, the OS's I am mainly interested in are RSX11m, TENEX, TOPS20,
VMS, UNIX, and TOPS10. I will compile such alist if none already exists,
and store it in some appropriate place, like the CPM dir.

Thanks, Ed

Didn't someone outdate the FMAP/UCAT two step process and turn it
into a simple one step processs. The program that I remember was
written in BDS C.  It made life much simpler, because it allowed
continuous opperation.  The user would insert a disk to be cataloged
into the B drive, catalog it, and then have the option of quiting
or cataloging another disk.

One counter-comment on the termcap reference.  Apparently the 4.2bsd
distribution will have an overhauled and completely different terminal
definition package (encoded in binary, therefore much faster).  Thus,
I see no need for anyone to maintain compatability with the old 
termcap.  The hot ticket would be to design it with the new one in mind.

I am currently in the process of bringing up a system with 5.25" 
double-density double-sided floppies.  The controller I am using
is the 1791.  The 1791 specification gives instructions on how
to format single and double-density 8" floppies, but not 5.25".
Could someone take a look at their format program and see what
sequence of bytes I need to write out to format a 5.25" double
density floppy with 16 256-byte sectors (soft sectored).

Thanks...

The most recent edition of Computer Architecture News
(CAN) includes an article which compares the performance
of Intel's 80286 with other processors.  Its a short
article consisting primarily of a couple of tables.

The tables seem to indicate that a 10MHz 80286 performed
five or six small benchmarks much faster than all other
tested processors including a 16MHz 68000 and a VAX 780!

I've been reading some literature on the 80286 and it appears
overcome most of the limitations of the 8086 including
limited address space for processes and lack of protection.

From where I stand, the smaller 80186 (a single chip coupling
the 8086 with some support functions) and the 80286 look like
parts of a pretty large comeback for Intel and the 8086-family
in the microcomputer marketplace.

Maybe its not really a comeback since Intel was never really
behind.  However, for a while (before the announcement of the IBM PC)
it looked as if the 68000 was going to steal the show.

I would aprreciate hearing from people with information and/or
opinions about the 80286.

Thanks,

These files replace the FMAP/UCAT files used in Ward Christensen's disk
catalog program. NCAT is considerably simpler to use in single or multi-
drive systems and does the catalog function in one step. There is also a
provision for reporting the amount of free space on each disk. This program
can be set at assembly time to include all user areas, but does not allow
the specification of which user number on which a file resides. It is thus
compatible with FMAP/UCAT rather than FMAP2/UCAT2.
XCAT generates a MAST.LST file with cross-referenced entries suitable for
hard-copy output.

On behalf of the Midwest Affiliation of Computer Clubs  (MACC),
the  Toronto  Region  Association of Computer Enthusiasts, Inc.
(TRACE) is proud to announce that the 9th annual MACC Computer-
fest  will be held in Toronto, Ontario, Canada from July 8th to
10th, 1983.  Here's what the event is about:

ORGANIZATION:  A Computerfest committee was formed in  June  of
1982  by  volunteers  from  TRACE,  one  of  the oldest amateur
computer groups in the area.  The  committee  meets  regularly,
and  is  supported  by  several professional advisors recruited
since its inception.  The TRACE computerfest committee competed
successfully  against two other MACC clubs for the privilege of
hosting Computerfest '83, winning the nod by a large majority.

THEME:  Computerfest '83 will be aimed at the computer hobbyist
and  the  interested public.  The overriding motif will be that
"computers are fun!".  The festival will serve  to  communicate
that  message to the public by the example of the participants. 
The registration fees will be  kept  low  to  encourage  public
involvement  and  to  attract  the  largest  number of computer
hobbyists to join in the fun.

EVENTS:  We hope to attract several well-known  hobby-computing
figures   to   take  part  in  a  program  including  seminars,
demonstrations, and exhibits on a wide variety of software- and
hardware-related   topics.    Many   of  the  Toronto  region's
computerists  will  be  involved  in  the  program  either   as
individuals   or  in  connection  with  club  projects.   MACC-
associated  clubs and  individuals  will  be  participating  as
well.   Vendors   of   computer   components  and   peripherals 
will  be  displaying   their   wares,  and  a  flea-market  and
auction will be part  of  the  show.   Further  details  of the
program will be publicized as the schedule gels.

S-100 or Multibus system available.  Questions:

1.  Comments please - which is a better bus to have (S-100 or
Multibus), and why?  Which bus has more things made for it?  Which is
more susceptible to failure?  Which has more stuff supported under
common micro operating systmes (e.g., CP/M)?  My needs are those of a
person who doesn't want to do a bunch of hardware hacking.

2.  What is the track record of Dynabyte hardware?  Anyone out there
actually running a Dynabyte system?  Experiences with Dynabyte as a
company from the user support perspective?  

copies to the list as well as me, please.

There are several known variations:

LMODEM in MacLisp by Ed Barton (EB@MC or EB@OZ).  This is the
granddaddy of the mainfame modem implementations and is what we use to
up and download the majority of the files to MC:CPM; over the past two
years.  Unfortunately, it is known to work only on the ITS machines
which run MacLisp... Automatically detects if the user is connected to
the host via TELNET (ARPANET) and makes the appropriate adjustments...

(Source: MC:FJW;LMODEM >)


UMODEM in C by Lauren Weinstein (vortex!lauren@lbl-unix) and Rick Conn
(rconn@BRL) for Unix machines.  Has an option for use via ARPANET, but
not tested in that mode due to brain-damaged NCP which strips user
data of the 8th bit on input...

(Source: MC:CPM;AR43:UMODEM C)


TMODEM in C by Eliot Moss (EBM@XX) and more recently by Rick Conn and
just recently by Ed Barton.  TMODEM is a rewrite of UMODEM for TOPS-20
and TENEX machines.  TMODEM is in limbo and in need of further
debugging at last report.  TMODEM is the only one of this list (other
than LMODEM) known to run via an ARPANET TIP or TAC connection.

(Source: MC:CPM:AR43:TMODEM C - may not be THE latest version)


VMODEM in C by Rick Conn for the VAX under VMS(?) - based on TMODEM.


XMODEM in SAIL by Max Diaz (MMD@SAIL).  XMODEM appears to require
"Control-C capability"...  It does not work via ARPANET (yet).

Source: MC:CPM;AR60:XMODEM SAI and XMODEM SAIMSG)


MODEM in MAC by Bill Westfield (BILLW@SRI-KL).  This MODEM is the best
of the lot for TOPS-20 users at this time.  It does not yet work via
ARPANET (yet).

(Source: MC:CPM;AR60:MDM20 158MAC and MDM20X 48MAC, an "experimental"
version by Ted Shapin (BEC.SHAPIN@USC-ECLC) based on MDM20 158MAC).


FTPS and FTPG in MAC by Aaron Wohl (WOHL@CMU-20C).


And, finally, FMODEM, by Dr. Larry Armijo and myself, written in
FORTRAN IV (for the SEL 32/55) and FORTRAN-77 (for the SEL 32/77).

(Source: MC:FJW;AR4:FMODEM FOR for the 55, and S77MDM FOR for the 77).


If you do anything with any of these, please let their authors know
about it - and me, too.

    I would be interested to know what hardware/software is available
related to the 68000.  For example, I know that there is an S-100 board
for MC68000 available from DUAL (MC68000 CPU).  What kind of operating
system (cheap) is available for PC budget.  Is there a CP/M like operating
system for the 68000?  Are there any dual processor boards (other than
the 6502/68000).  How about a Z80/68000 board?

    I think CompuPro may be coming out with a 68k board but I can't
get any information on it.

    Thanks in advance.

Multibus probably has more "professional" quality hardware
manufactured for it.  Things like hard disk controllers,
ethrnet interfaces, .5 inch tape controllers, etc.  The
S100 bus has more "hobbiest" type interfaces: voice, low res
graphics, etc.  Multibus tends to be significaantly more
expensive than s100 for equivilent functionality.  In fact,
a bare WW board is about twice as much for multibus as for
S100.  Multibus has its own regulated power supply, which
moves regulation off the individual boards.  This may help
prevent heath problems on the boards, but it makes for a
much more expensive main power supply.  The definitions
that expand multibus to 16 data bits and 24 address lines
are justas ad hoc as the expansion of the S100 bus.

I recently purchased two of these half height 8" DDDS drives
and made the following discoveries:
1) two will not fit in the same cutout as a standard size drive,
   unless the hole is oversized.
2) mention is made of a bracket to mount 2 drives in a single slot,
   however, no mention of how/where to get said bracket.
3) drive motor startup time VERY slow, as opposed to advertised
   claims that it features 1/2 rotation time startup.
4) one has already died after less than 10 hours use. Seems it
   lost the ability to read/write 2 sided disks.(this includes one
   formatted on the drive itself).

I had asked about the drives (local OEM) before buying, and was told
they seemed fine, but of course later comments seen here and else-where
don't look so good. I wonder what the root of the problem is? Are all
the 1/2 highs as bad? Or is Tandon just having a bad run? After this
I may give up on 1/2 highs and stick with QUME/MITSUBISHI and another
box to hold the drives, as it would have been less of a bother.
 
What about the 5.25 DDDS (96tpi) drives, are there any 'gotchas'?

Having a sector somewhere on track 0 that told you usefull information
about the disk would be nice. Unfortunately, it wouldn't give the
"infinite portability" you seem to want. Problems show up in figuring
out what format track zero is in to begin with, and then as to whether
or not your hardware will read said disk. For example, I recently got a
standard 8" disk from a friend - I couldn't read it. Seems that there
had been a third party (going from my S100 8" to friends Apple 5 1/4")
who had copied the stuff to a double sided diskette, in standard 8" single
density format. My system doesn't recognize that a double density diskette
is something it can read. Tack onto this the fact that not everybody uses
the WD 177x controllers (for instance, I have an NEC PD765) and there
are formats that some chips will write that others won't read...

A couple of us localy have considered putting in a "mount table" for
a fifth (or third) disk. Said disk would have no entries for the translate
table or DPB (I think I grabbed the right block). When the user issued
a "mount cromdb26 b:", the system would dig those tables up out of a disk
file, and patch them into the  bios. At the same time, the disk B DPH would
be fixed to use the tables. This may be similar to your login command, but
was designed specifically to let us read ANYBODIES diskette (withen
aforementioned chip limitations). The problem is that this thing is VERY
dangerous (at the same level as multiple density 1.x systems), VERY system
dependent, and would require much work to add a new disk format. We eventually
decided that it wasn't worth the trouble - the two of us could share 8" SSDD, and
8"SSSD worked reasonably well for everybody else.

For the past three years, Lifeboat has been the exclusive distributor of
BDS C. This will not be true for more than a few days longer; a new
NON-exclusive contract has been negotiated, and should be signed all around
very shortly. Therefore, BDS C will soon be purchasable from the C User's
Group (Robert Ward, et. al. in Kansas) and other distributors. I don't
mean this as an advertisement, though; I just want all those people who've
refused to have anything to do with Lifeboat yet desire BDS C to know that
soon there'll be a way to buy it without making Lifeboat a cent.

Some months ago I received a call from some guy who admitted to having a 
bootleg BDS C, who wanted to pay me for it but refused to buy anything
from Lifeboat. The number of customer-service related horror stories I've
been sent from irate Lifeboat customers is also pretty staggering. I
hope the word gets around that there are going to be other sources for
the package! Lifeboat will still be carrying it, but buying it from
the User's Group will make the Group have money to play with for neat
things like remote software-snarfing systems. RBBS operators: pass the
word! thanks,

I get a lot of mail on this; my correspondents are about equally
divided between enthusiastic liking of Tanden thins, and utter
hatred of them.  One major OEM refuses tohandle them because (he
tells me) test indicate excessive media wear.  He is
particularly adamant about not using Tanden 5 1/4" disks.

In the hundreds of letters I have, almost all complining about
disks concern 5 1/4 " except for a few which det est Tanden tin
8" (and I have never had anyone write me about any 8" except
those).  Of course this is hardly a random sample, and I pass it
on for what it's worth.

writing a sort of mini-operating system in FORTH of all things
(as he says, FORTH programmers will understand the documentation

onmachines they have, they can play about with trying to do
software for the 68000 on S-100 bus.

	[This was originally sent to info-Pascal, but comsat
returned with note that there is no such mailing list.  It is, I
think, imporant enough to bother all of you although it is of
value only to Pascal people...]


	We are preparing an article as a submission in design of
a new standard Pascal Prime.  Pascal Prime is intended to
preserve the "spirit" of Pascal and retain its remarkably good
features as a teaching language, while making Pascal more
usable as a practical programming language.

	The idea is to specify a minimum set of extensions to
the language.  The extended language will be called PASCAL
PRIME.

	There will be a conference  at West Coast Computer
Faire, with several of the major compiler writers in attendence.
Features that ought to be in PASCAL PRIME will be discussed.
The whole mess will get fairly wide publicatin.


	Here are some candidate features.  Arguments for or against
their inclusion, plus suggestions for other features which
should be included, will be appreciated.

	FILES IN RECORDS to be allowed.  This is not
controversial, or hasn't been.  Indeed, it's in the standard,
although many implementations don't have it.
 MT+ allows.  UCSD does not .  We
think clearly desirable.

	OTHERWISE statement after CASE.  (OTHERWISE rather than
ELSE since latter may confuse readers...?)

	Ignore underbars as clarity character; do not see.
	
	Guarantee the order of evaluation of AND and OR and
parenthesized statements.

	Is a BREAK statement needed?   It  would be expensive.
It might also be against the spirit of the language; but it
certainly would make writing programs more convenient.


	Needs STRINGS and LONG STRINGS to have the same
relationship as integers and long integers.  Most micro
implementations and indeed most implemenations have strings
anyway.


	A Dynamic Size Array  variable type?
This can also get expensive and needs thought.

UCASE & Lcase
These are needed as standard library features because they are
almost always needed, and are often badly written...

STATIC variables: which are LOCAL to a procedure or functin, but
which do not go away when you exit the function.  Best example
would be the seed for a random number functions.

Standards for separate compilation and INCLUDE.

A way to reseve blocks of memory and get at particular memory
addresses.  This is of course machine dependent, and needs
thought since it compromises portability, but ye gods, without
it you are in real trouble..especially with memory map video...

Ways to get at the programmer stack?  Thought needed; we are not
trying to make Pascal become C.

	Elementary math in the CONSTANT declarations.  At least
allow four-function arithmetic plus chr(x) and ord(x) in the
CONST declarations  [Bell = chr(7) as a legal statement]

Read and write enumeration types.


	And as few other ideas.  Discussion welcome.  What does
PASCAL needd to make it  the right langauge?

CRCK.COM does that, gives a "cyclic redundancy check" rather than
simple checksum. CRC is less prone to errors than checksums.  The
source code, COM file and HEX file (in case you cannot FTP COM files)
is available on MIT-MC as AR24:CPM;CRCK 42BASM and CRCK 42BCOM.  The
HEX file is in AR13:CPM;CRCK 42BHEX.  The program prints the file
names as it reads each file, has optional command to write that output
to a disk file on the default drive.

I have the visual editor from Dr. Dobb's on an arpanet machine. I now

I feel that this stuff belongs in an archive on mc, but don't know how

initializers, floats, doubles, etc?  Finally, does the software include
a standard i/o package and how similar is this package to the UNIX
stdio library.  I would appreciate any information that anyone can give
me.  Thank you very much.

You seem to have an inside ear at Godbout. Anything new to report on
the BIOS you told us about some months back? A lot of mouths are

to be working on a Z80 designed for slaving to a 16 bitter like the

I looked at the Aztec C II compiler a couple of weeks ago. Their claim is
that it implements the language defined by K & R, minus bitfields. As close
as I can tell, they do that. It does indeed have statics, longs, floats,
doubles, initializers, typedefs, macros, etc. The I/O library is very complete
compared to other CP/M C compilers - the only thing missing (from the I/O
library) was scanf. Note, however, that the Unix system calls are not there:
read is by 128 byte blocks, etc. even though fread, etc work as expected. Also,
ONLY the stdio type things are there. You don't get libdbm, the sort routines,
etc.

Nor is it exactly Unix C. For example, I tried compiling some code from a
Unix system (it wasn't mine), and had some troubles. Mainly, the turkey who
wrote the Unix code liked to do things like:

	long dx ;

	z = dx . loint ;

which caused Aztec C to complain.  There may be other such things. I consider
this particular problem to be a change for the better, and expect that
there will be more like it. Also, anything added to C by berkeley or since
K & R appeared won't be in the compiler - enum's, structure assignment, etc.

Summary - this is probably the best buy in a C compiler for CP/M if you are
looking for a good C compiler for CP/M. If you want something to let you
move code back and forth - it's not quite right. You can buy a version
for Unix (or so they claim) which would give you the best bet for such things.

Yes, I got it, as did a few others here. While I have not put it to
much use, it does seem to be a very reasonable Pascal. It is a
P-code type compiler, like CBASIC's INT files, so is not as
fast as some.
You can't beat the price, even if you hate Pascal (or programming).

Oops - after posting the message about the visual editor from Dr. Dobb's,
I find that OKC-UNIX doesn't have a protocol for people on other sites
to ftp files away. *sigh*

It has now been placed on mit-mc where w8sdz at mc requested, and he will
announce when it has been put in the cpm directory.

For those of you not familiar with this package, it is a public domain
visual editor. The (small C) source was published about a year ago in
Dr. Dobb's. The version I uploaded has been transformed into BDS C, and
has a few extra nobs and whistles, and slightly more speed. It is written
in a highly modular form, and is extensively commented about. I had no trouble
making it work on my system, and likewise for the other people locally who've
tried it out.

However - I don't use, having paid good money (and well-spent) for Mince. One
person locally decided it was to slow, and went back to his (unix) ed-based
editor. Therefore, I won't say that what's on mc will work. I will say that it
should be close. Likewise, if you have problems with it, I can't really help
with those. If pieces are missing, then I can help.

Another problem I am told that they have: they do not have an adjustable
track zero sensor. Therefore, every once in a while, a restore operation
will cause the head to seek to track 1 or track -1. It depends on the
drive. I have this second hand, so someone really should check...

Tony Pietsch has delivered his do-all BIOS to Godbout; it is
shorn of the ability to run the Semi-Disk, but it does
everything else.  They will now test it adn get documentation
done (Tony's strong pint is not that, and I refused to do it on
grounds of too many other committments).

Thus this ought to be available in a couple of months.  Bet I
can do.   Sorry.  I was given a bit of a can tied to my tail for
mentioning it on the net earlier--it seems they got a LOT of
calls about it, and didn't have it then ...  Sorry again.  I'll
know better next time.

re CPM 3.0 all I know is I am told I am supposed to be a test
site, but no date has been set, and I have seen nothing; I hear
stories from those who have, but  nothing I'd repeat.

Re z-80/8086 duals, no information.

SAGE 68000 running UCSD Pascal as the OS works, and machines are
being delivered; I have seen them.

I was perusing compuserve the other day, and noticed that someone
hsa uploaded a FancyFont demo file.  Any chance of someone uploading
this to the arpanet ? (I am willing to supply storage for a while,
if necessary.  I understand the file is some 45K bytes long...)

	I got what I think is the real story on this the other day:
	It's being sold so cheap for two reasons: (1) The guy who sells
it wanted to see if he could make money selling so cheap you might as
well buy it as copy it; and he IS making money at it.  (2) He will be
coming out shortly with a native code compiler, which will sell for (I
think it was) $495; in the mean time, a lot of people will get
comfortable with the P-code version, just wishing there were a native
code version, and he'll have a really tremendous mailing list of Pascal
users.

	A friend of mine just bought this C compiler, and I've been reading
the manual.  I don't remember seeing any mention of it here, so let me
summarize it.  It looks very good, and only costs $50.

	It's Kernighan & Ritchie C, except no:
		o  float, double, and long data types (actually it will
		   accept long, but stores it as 16-bits, just like int).
		o  typedef.
		o  Arguments to #define macros.
		o  Bit fields.
		o  #line.
		o  Declarations within nested blocks (i.e., you have to
		   declare all local variables at the beginning of the
		   function definition).

	It does have compile-time initializers, type casts, and static.
	It produces assembly code (and you can include assembly inline in
the C code with the #asm directive), for either an abs assembler provided
with the package, or for Microsoft Macro-80 (so you can link it with other
Macro-80 programs).
	The compiler will produce execution profile code.  If you have a
real-time clock available, it will tell how much time was spent in each
function, and even if you don't, it will tell you how many times each
function was called.  A related facility allows tracing, by telling you
each time a function was entered or exited.
	It uses an interesting approach to local variables:  There are two
types: auto and register.  Auto variables are allocated on the stack, but
register variables are allocated at abs locations but then saved on the
stack when the function starts up (making references to them much faster).
Local variables default to register, but can be forced to auto by declaring
them as such.  Parameters can also be declared register, in which case they'll
be moved to abs locations at function startup time.
	Run-time support includes I/O redirection of standard in/out
(following the Unix V6 model of fin/fout, not the stdio model of
stdin/stdout/stderr), random access file I/O, and limited storage
allocation (you can alloc, but you can't free) .

	The starting point for this compiler was Ron Cain's SmallC, but it
sure has been expanded a lot.

	I haven't played with the compiler at all (I plan to get a copy and
try some benchmarks, etc.), but if it does what the manual says, and
assuming it produces reasonable code, it sure looks nice.

Just finished an article for BYTE comparing several CP/M Pascal
and C compilers on a couple of different programs.  Aztec C does
indeed seem to be as advertised, and has very good portability
to unix C systems.  It has all the good stuff you mentioned, and
data types all the way up through double.  The library is pretty
complete, and is about to be further expanded.  It is also claimed
to be very compatible with C86 from Computer Innovations (Manx
and CI cross-market each other's products). BDS and C/80 are good
too, and a lot cheaper, though not as complete at this time.
