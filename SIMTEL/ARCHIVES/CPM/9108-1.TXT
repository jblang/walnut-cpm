I have uploaded to SIMTEL20:

pd2:<cpm.asmutl>
HD64180A.LBR    Collection of .ASM routines for 64180 chip
HD64180B.LBR    HD64180 programs for embedded controllers

The CRCs are:

---> HD64180B.LBR     CRC  =  E6 16
---> HD64180A.LBR     CRC  =  28 9E

The author of the software in both libraries is Richard C. Holmes of
SME Systems, (Melbourne, Australia).  This is what he wants to say
about the software:

Re   : Z80 Source code modules / monitor / Exec / download

In General
----------
The software on this disk / in this library constitutes a very large
and extended programming (and debugging) effort over a number of
years. It will be largely up to the user to determine how to use the
software provided as it has always been an in-house product - no
manuals exist for this software.

The software is used to provide a control monitor program with quite a
few facilities that make programming embedded Z80 systems a lot
easier. The soft- ware is supplied in source and library form suitable
for the RMAC/LINK/LIB digital research products and includes some
batch files for linkage. RMAC was used as this is what I learned on
and stuck to, thick and thin!

Stop here. I am not interested in a debate as to the reletive merits
of Intel instruction set vs Zilog. I learned on Intel with ASM on a
CP/M 1.4 system and have stayed with these op-codes.

Well, o.k. - I'll have my say :

I hate LD as an opcode - MVI/LXI/LHLD/LDED/STA/LDA.. etc.. are much
more descriptive and "talk better in my head". I feel they are thefore
less prone to being used by mistake than the common cure all LD
instruction when you gotta use brackets and other things. URK. I bet
it's difficult finding a mis-used LD instruction!

The Copyrights of SME Systems and Holmes Industries are mine. I am a
director of both companies and I HEREBY permit all the Z80 and HD64180
type software to be used so long as :-

1. No charge is made for it. It is still my code. You can use it, modify
   it, extract from it BUT NOT SELL IT. If you sell it then lets talk!

2. No liability under any circumstance is placed upon me or any of my
   companies due to its use or mis-use. You use the code, then any
   problems are yours.

These notes have been written to a long time after the enclosed
software was written.

The software that I give you has been used by me and my customers for
years.  This is not to say that it is bug free or even that it is
suitable for anything other than looking at. Standard disclaimer..

All the code is in the Digital Research RMAC format and the (partial)
support library I wrote for the hitachi derivative are provided. There
are undoubtedly some enhanced instructions I have not bothered to
encode.......

I try to stick to a "RISC" type programming methode whereby I use a
limited set of simple instructions and avoid at all cost anything that
may get me "caught up". I like my code to be SIMPLE.

As to the software itself, I have not been overly bothered with tricky
programming and tight code, rather, with making the source a little
easier to work with and therefore reletively "clean". If I needed a
faster program then I use a faster hardware solution. It is MUCH
cheaper than fiddling with software unless quantity is involved.

If you want tricky super tight software then forget it! I hope you
agree with me. To us in a small-run commercial environment where debug
time can be expensive, a little extra time spent planning and writing
more maintainable code has been encouraged.

I am giving this software to you because I have little use for it now.
I love the Z80 and its derivatives and would like to see other users
benefit from my effort.

If you feel strongly enough about the software that you must tell me
something, then please do so.

A problem with ZDE is that the installation program doesn't seem
to be easy to get hold of. I was looking for it on Simtel20 a few 
weeks ago and it wasn't there. Although I use ZDE, it's annoying 
not to be able to change the defaults.

The installation program for VDE 2.66 is avaialable from SIMTEL20
and wuarchive.

SIMTEL20 is now connected to the NSFNET via WESTNET.  Its regular

throughput for non-Milnet users because the packets are no longer

Hi!

I just moved to NYC from Mass. To avoid large phone bills, I had do

But, I would like to stay in touch... and was wondering if there was

or a Mirroring BBS?

Manhattan is fine, too... I will switch to a different metering plan.
It's darn worth it!!!!!

Subject: ZSM23: LIB.L corrupt?
Message-ID: <1991Aug03.212725.7788@actrix.gen.nz>

 [Sorry if this is a duplicate - our news posting program has been
  rejecting stuff for most of the day, or at least appearing to.] 

I was given a copy of David Goodenough's ZSM23.LBR, assembler package.
It looks like a really good assembler, with lots of useful subroutines
supplied.

However, when I came to extract the files, I found that two of the files
in my copy of ZSM23.LBR had the wrong checksums (I used CRCK4.COM to
generate the checksums - everything else was okay).  The two files were:
LIB.L and LIB.DOC

	file        READ-ME    my CRCK
	LIB.L       57-81      16-60
	LIB.DOC     45-F1      48-01

I am not so worried about LIB.DOC as I am about LIB.L.  When I tried to
reassemble ZCAT.Z, and link it, everything appeared to go okay until I
tried to run it.  I used:

	C> ZCAT <wgtnbb57.txz >wgtnbb57.txt

This type of command line arguement worked with the version that was
supplied compiled, but not with my new version that I had assembled.
The program failed with a BDOS error saying that drive H: didn't exist.
Not surprising - I don't have a drive H.

I would be interested to hear the CRCK values that other people get for
these files.  Depending on the values, I might be interested in
obtaining a copy of these files (uuencoded) by mail.  NOTE: PLEASE DON'T
JUST SEND THE FILES. I don't want dozens of files turning up in my
mailbox, especially as I pay for it by volume.  If you are willing to
send me the files, please send an offer first, and I will get back to
you.

BTW, I do know that the ZSM23.LBR package is available from the RNA at
David's UUCP site, but there are two problems with just requesting it.
Firstly, I don't know if it suffers from the same problem , and
secondly, I would rather not get a 90K file by Email, just because one
small part of my version is corrupt (cost, see above).

Thanks in advance for the assistance.

Dear CPM wizards.. two related things. First does anyone out there have a
list of the options available on DR's F77 compiler Ver. 4.1 running under
CPM/86 (syntax.. F77 Filename ??options) as I got this with my machine but 
(as ever) no docs.
I am after this info 'cause I am trying to compile Dungeon (aka Zork) for my
machine. The source is supposed to compile under F77 but I am getting LOTS of
errors. To avoid an attempt to re-invent the wheel has anyone managed to port
this to run under CPM/86. I have the original VAX version & an MSDOS version 
at work, but would really like to play at home :->

I have still been unable to get fileplot to work on my trs-80

specification.  The install program could not find fileplot.com
at all.
 
I tried running fileplot on my televideo ts803h, and it worked
proplerly. So I tried running the install program to set it up
for my printer. The install program did find fileplot.com and
told me that it was set up for a Proprinter correctly, but
aborted with a run-time error (i/o error 99) when I tried to have
it install for Epson printers.
 
The documentation says that the program is written in turo
pascal?  Examination of the .com file shows a Borland
International copyright notice.  Is there problem with turbo
pascal .com files that these platforms?
 
Has anyone else gotten this program to run?

Subject: zde vs vde/Qterm/Simtel
Message-ID: <9522703@ub.cc.umich.edu>

Several of you have said that I'd be better off using zde than vde.  I like vde
and it's nice and small, which is the reason I started using it in the first
place.  What advantage does zde have, and how big is it?  I am using the
current version of vde for most things, but an older version on disks that
I need more space on, as it (the older one) is only 10k, as opposed to 16k.
(And I'm still looking for the installation file for the 10k version so I
can channge its defaults.)
 
On to Qterm.  I followed someone's advice and found out how to add blank        
characters as pad at the end of the line on our mainframe system, and that
helped a lot.  Just adding a three-characters-worth delay keeps from dropping
characters on screen, and gives my Kaypro time to catch up with most of the
vt100 control codes.  Once in a while the vt100 still gets confused, no matter
how long the pad is, but the situation is vastly improved.  (So how do I
pad the end of the line when I'm talking to unix machines?)  I thought
I'd mention that here since I've had mail from many other people who were
having similar problems with lost text (at 2400 baud) on their Kaypros or
other slow machines.
 
I notice that Simtel seems much faster now that it's on NSFNET, if anyone is
wondering.

Subject: Kaypro and .LBR files
Message-ID: <SMD.91Aug8162436@vab01.larc.nasa.gov>

Kaypro Folks,

I yet have a Kaypro II, pre-84 I *think.*  It came bundled with lots of
bad documentation :-(  I am very interested in using FASTERM and other
CP/M PD goodies that have come out since then, but have not updated my
operating system.  I also have no idea on how to un-LBR these .LBR files
to get them to run.

Does any kind soul here have any pointers on where to learn about them?
Any books?  Something on-line (better)?  I am a CS major, so I should be
able to grok stuff.... I hate to throw away a (almost) perfectly good
computer just because it no longer has the bundled software to do what
I want it to do...

Thanks any and all in advance.

Sad and CPM in Eastern Virginia.

Subject: M80 question
Message-ID: <FREED.91Aug8113307@fraktur.adobe.com>

Can anyone please answer a few questions regarding the M80 assembler:

1. Does it support the BSS segment (uninitialized data to go into RAM, while
 cseg and dseg are in ROM)?

2. What are the command line options? I got it with no documentation and only
figured out M80 foo=foo.mac. My manuals on MAC - RMAC do not help much.
Also 'list' does not turn the listfile on.
How does one use the L80?

3. Does anyone have a nice cross-assembler for Z80 to run on a PC or a UNIX
box, shareware prefered?


Thanks.

	Cseg, of course, merely sets the current location counter and
	  will happily accept Code and Data, as will /Common/, Aseg,
          and Dseg.  So constants under Aseg/Cseg and uninit'd data
          under Dseg.  L80, can then be asked to locate segments as
          needed.

	M80 .PRN,.REL=.MAC /L /C /R
	             /L = list file
                     /C = generate .CRF for CREF80

                        end up on other drives)

	And L80

	A> L80 rel,rel,rel,...,COM/E/N

	Greetings. Hahah... $200... hahah... Tell you what, if any of you
	wants to experiment with an Altos 5-15, you can have mine for only
	$100 (and I pay shipping).

	It comes with MP/M, CP/M, a BBS system, all the above (2 720K 5 1/4"
	drives), and a user's manual.

	One catch, however, no CASE. If you want, I can even supply (pardon
	the pun :-) you with a 160W IBM AT PS. Not only is it small, it's
	also a LOT lighter than a linear.

	Take care.

	P.S. Hey, let's trade: I need decent probes for a 20MHz 'scope,
	a 1.44MB 3 1/2" drive, lessee... frequency counter (~20MHz), oh,
	yeah, how about a signal generator (say 20MHz)? I pay shipping and
	we swap!

	(all in good humor, by the way. Not to be rude or something... ;-)

I get the same problem, but only with files opened using 
_fopen(fname,"wo") (ie. binary files).

As I can't contact Dave Goodenough (mail to dg@pallio.UUCP goes 
into the bit-bucket somewhere) I'm also interested in a fix for 
this. (I pay for incoming mail, so no posting binaries to me, 
please).

Message-ID: <CMM.0.90.2.681604787.ephillip@magnus.acs.ohio-state.edu>

Well, the genuis of the day is Brett(sp?) Laverman, who figured out
why this here televideo wasn't sending anything to the screen, even tho'
everything seemed to be in working order..... it seems that televideo,
in a momentary spurt of comedy, swapped the terminal and printer RS232's
on the cpu. I plugged the screen into it, and away we went. Of course,
now there's a new slew of problems. 

1) It seems to boot up off the floppy, which I think it calls a>
   
2) The harddrive (hd) seems to be copnfigured to be the b> & c>
drives. b> is ok, but c> is trashed with sector problems. I'm going
to attempt to format some floppies and dump the contents of b> to
them, then reformat the hd. Anybody got any docs on this procedure?
Also, anyone know how I can get it to boot off the hd w/o a floppy
in the drive?

3) When I type dir at the a> prompt, I get a LOTTA stuff. Can all
this be on one little old floppy? Or is it mebbe somehow running
the dir of b> ?

4) Is it possible to obtain manuals for this thing, or is that a
pipedream?

5) It seems to have a connection for a paralell printer. Is it a
straighforward connection, and works immediately upon, say, sending
stuff to the printer in WS, or do I gotta run some funky printer
driver/control program too? I'd REALLY like to use one of today's
high speed printers with this thing. That and the hd is the only
reason I'm playing with this thing!

6) A modem. Where/how to connect it, since it seems nothing came
outta the other RS232 connector when I had the terminal hooked to it.

7) The terminal that came with it seems to require a lot of key
punching just to get it going; I gotta reset the baud rate, etc
everytime I turn it on. Can I just use a simple old dumb terminal,
preset to the proper baud rate, and leave it at that?

Well, there's the update! Any further advise is appreciated!

There are a number of utilities that will un-LBR files for you.
However, you should also be aware that after extraction from the .LBR
file you may find that they have been compressed in some manner.  The
filename extension would identify the method, e.g. ?Q? for Squeezed, ?Z?
for Crunched, and ?Y? for LZH compression.  Unfortunately, the nicest of
all library utilities has never been updated (to my knowledge) to handle
anything other than squeezed files.  That utility is NULU.COM.  So, in
addition to NULU you would need a late version of UNCRUNCH.COM which
will handle LZH as well as crunched files.  Alternatively, you can get a
copy of EXL.COM which will both extract from the library and also
de-compress the file, but is no where near as convenient to use.  As a
paranthetic note, if your Kaypro is in fact a II vice 2, it is by
definition a pre-84 machine.

Probably you best bets on books are the library(?), swapmeets and
flea-markets, and used book stores.  One of the more comprehensive tomes
- The Waite Group's CP/M Bible published by Sams *may* still be
available, I'm not sure.  It is a good reference.

Hello friends,

    I'm a Aztec C V 1.06B user and I need the Error Messages List.
    At present, I have to guess the meaning of Error Code.
    That's not so good!
    By the way, does anybody have a small and simple text editor
    source code in C?
    I have already tried EditC80 but it didn't work width Aztec C.
    Probably, I don't know enough to.

              Thanks in advance,

                        Andre Jr.

                  C P / M - 8 0   C O M P I L E R   L I S T
                  =========================================

  This list is an attempt at answering most of the `Can anyone tell me what
the best CP/M compiler for language "foo" is?' questions. Please do not
expect this list to be definitive. I am very much dependent on the information
sent to me, and if nobody mentioned a certain compiler, chances are you won't
find it here. If you know of a compiler that should be in the list, send me
a description.

  Compiler categories:
    I've split up the list into two parts, based on how much info I have on
the compiler concerned. The first list is a list of compilers with some kind
of description, the second list contains compiler only known to me by name.
Please note that 1 (one) line of descriptive comment is enough to make it a
category 1 compiler. ;-)

  Compiler availability:
    Many compilers are still sold, others can only be obtained as an illegal
copy. Also some compilers are public domain, but alas that group is rather
small. I think that, even though many companies are no longer actively
engaged in maintaining their CP/M packages, they will _not_ look kindly on
publicly announced copying. Since I received _no_ communications from
persons working for companies like Borland, Microsoft, and Digital Research,
I wonder if any of them monitor this list. Perhaps we as collective CP/M
users can draw some goodwill, and persuade them to remove some of the copying
restrictions on e.g. binaries.
  I mention the copyright holder when known. "?? PD ??" means that I don't
know, but that they are for sale at such a low rate that I suspect them to
be at least shareware.
  Many Bulletin Boards have interesting software, and Ed Grey not only
runs a BBS, but also sells MIX C and Turbo PASCAL v3. RS components in
England also sells originals materials. I mention these two as example,
undoubtebly there are others with remnants of a large stock. JRT PASCAL,
Prolog-80, Micro-COBOL, Forth-83, Small-C and others are appearently
PD, and can be had from BBSes. PCW world seems to have MBASIC on one of
their disks, but I'm doubtful about their right to do this.

  References:
    I include the names of all those that sent me information on the
compilers, since they are likely to know more if you have questions about
a specific product.

  The rumors:
    Hah! many! I'm forced to reject rumors that Microsoft is no longer
interested: RS components still sells compilers for CP/M+ - including
Macro-80! - for three figure amounts.

                *********************************

The MIX C compiler is a complete implementation of C as defined 
in "The C Programming Language" by Kernighan and Richie (the K & 
R standard).  The C library functions provided are compatible 
with the Unix standard, therefore the programs written with MIX C 
are easily ported to other computers and operating systems.  MIX 
C is available for both CP/M or PCDOS and source code written on 
one is easily transportable to the other.

The software is available on many UNIFORM supported 5.25" (DD) 
CP/M and IBM-PC (360K) disk formats.  I prefer to use TeleVideo 
(5.25", DD, DS, 48tpi) CP/M disks, since I use TeleVideo and can 
test them.  Please specify your choice.

The price for the MIX C Compiler is only $20.00 plus $5.00 for 
shipping and handling (UPS, ground in the continental US).  
Orders shipped to a California address must include 8.25% sales 
tax.  If you order both the CP/M and PCDOS versions of either the 
MIX C compiler or MIX Editor the price, with only one manual, is 
$30.00 (which includes the shipping).  Contact me at any address 
below for the additional shipping and insurance charges for 
deliveries outside the US (48 contiguous states) or for 
additional information.

                    ** System Requirements **

                         MIX C Compiler

CP/M version:                  MS/PCDOS version:

Well, I received quite a number of remarks that helped me update my first
version of the CP/M compiler list, so here comes the second version...

Unless I'm seriously mistaken, Chuck Forsberg's Zmodem transfer utility

While I've got the source, (in C), and a C compiler, I don't have
access to a VAX.

Subject: cp/m machine help
Message-ID: <1991Aug14.143318.9181@usenet.ins.cwru.edu>

I need information on a Televidio 803 which I believe is some sort of 
machine (circa 1982-1984) that uses the cp/m operating system.  My 
brother-in-law just inherited this beast and has begun exploring its
manuals and floppies.

The unit has a monochrome monitor, two floppy drives and for operating
software it has B-DOS (Before DOS?).  I believe it was previously used
in an office environment for wordprocessing, spreadsheet and probably 
some "desktop" functions.

I know nothing about cp/m but would like to know if it's possible to load
any of the versions of DOS onto this machine, or if its operation archi-
tecture is something that's BIOS dependant, or whatever.  Is there any 
hardware restriction as to what kind of operating system such a machine
can use?

Not having seen the unit, I don't know what its guts look like.  Do these
things have expansion slots like compatibles that would allow for the
addition of modem card?  And if so, are there communciations packages for
cp/m.  Please post any info here or send me email direct.

Thanks in advance

For sale:  Three Ithaca InterSystems DPS-1 computers.  Each one has:

  20-slot S-100 motherboard in a sturdy chassis with 25-amp power supply;
  Z-80 CPU, 64K RAM, diagnostic front panel with lots of lights and switches;
  SSDD disk controller and a pair of 8-inch floppy-disk drives.

In addition, there is a variety of interface cards, including serial, modem,
sound-effects, eprom-programmer, extender with logic probe, etc., and large
amounts of software (editors, compilers, debuggers, whatever).

All software is licensed, original disks and manuals, etc.  All hardware
includes schematics and manuals.  There are some books and magazines, too.

All three units were working when decommissioned.  One is missing its serial
card, but there's a spare from one of the others so it evens out.

No reasonable offer refused; you pay shipping.  Send email if interested.

Message-ID: <1991Aug14.100654.3730@imada.ou.dk>

QTERM 4.3 -- what's wrong?
-------------------------

I have downloaded QTERM 4.3 from simtel20, and have set the thing up
for my Rc700 [Danish brand].  It appears very neat and works fine
(vt100 emulation and all) until I try to do any kind of filetransfer.
(up or down)

In kermit it times out, and in X/Y modem it tells me that it receives
non-ack characters.  I have never gotten a transfer started yet.

This suggest a bad implementation of the i/o functions in the
overlayfile, but I have hooked it raw into the bios functions (which
works nicely in ZMP, even in X/Y modem).  I have interrupt driven
(with a 256 bytes buffer) serial comms, and besides runs at 1200 baud,
while testing this thing out.

Originally I thought it was modem problems but then I hooked up to a
PC with telix (null-modem) and I still had the problem. (And ZMP still
works perfectly)

Apparently the 7-bit mask have nothing to do with this, and I do not
see anything else appropiate.


Are there anybody who knows what I may have overlooked?


Thanks in advance

P.S.  Three reasons for not using ZMP.  
      1) Slooow  (runs at max 200 chars/sec)
      2) I need the cable from the second discdrive to power the PC, 
         and ZMP do *NOT* like transfers without the correct disk inserted in the
	 systemdrive.  
      3) ZMP crashes occasionally when stopping filetransfers prematurely.

  You can get an add-on card to permit use of the machine on Televideo's 
(obsolete) network server.  But like most CP/M boxes, you'll need a 
serial modem.
  There are several communications packages that could be used with it.
They are supplied in gneric form and you add the overlay specific to your 
machine.  Most available hardware is supported.
  BDOS is an acronym for Basic Disk Operating System.  It's part of CP/M.
  I have both operating software and the manual for the unit...

One small correction:  I am on the net and can be reached at
   ICOTTREL@EMR1.EMR.CA

The current version of the RCP/M list is now available for anonymous FTP
from sun2.emr.ca (132.156.36.14) in directory /pub.  The new version of
the list SHOULD be available from this site on the 1st of each month.

I would like to take this opportunity to ask all readers of this message
(from anywhere in the world) to send me any info about RCP/Ms, Z-Nodes, 
RASs (or whatever else you want to call them!) that support any flavour
of CP/M in their area.  I would very much like to produce a truly 
international RCP/M list (not just Canada and the US) and to do this, I
need help from international readers.  North American readers are also
asked to submit updates, additions and deletions for systems in their
areas.  I cannot afford to validate the entire list (~250 systems) on my
own, so would appreciate any help that can be offered in this area.  Thanks
in advance for your co-operation.

I think you mean BDOS (no dash), and that's just part of the CP/M OS.

Aaaaaaaaaaaarrrrrrggghh!!!! (please extend this to max display width :-))
Some people worry about 'life after death', but this is more like 'was
there computing before DOS', where DOS undoubtably means MeSsy-DOS. ;-)

Dear Stuart, this Televideo 803 will not only run no DOS programs, it
even doesn't run DOS itself! It has (probably) the amazing amount of
64 Kilobytes of memory (not 640, 64!). It's processor is _not_ one of Intel's
brain-damaged segmented 80x86es, but something immensely more unlikely:
The Zilog Z80! Max. addressing capability: 64KB, 8-bit registers, 16-bit
addressing. The 803 (probably) has a 4MHz processor clock. It's disk
format, though 360Kb, will makes any PC/XT/AT throw up unless guided by
a special utility.
  It also is a member of that unique and wunderfull family of machines that
can run most of each others programs, even when their hardware is grossly
incompatible, which is a quality MS-DOS tried to copy (Hell, MS-DOS version 1
was designed to be _completely_ system call compatible with CP/M, so binary
conversion programs could be used), but IBM managed to spoil it.

It has a serial port builtin. You'll have to get an _external_ modem. It
has no expansion slots, since it's not only incompatible, but actually..,
well,... incompatible!

I hope you don't get annoyed at this reply, but I just get emotional when
people mistake a _real_ machine for an IBM compatible. :-)

You should have a Systems Disk with CP/M-80 (ver 2.2) and other 
CP/M utilities.  The above and CP/M-80 (ver 3.0) are the only 
operating systems that you can use on the TeleVideo 803.  CP/M 
2.2 was standard for the computer (w/ 64K RAM), and it is 
expandable to 128K RAM and CP/M 3.0.

There are no expansion slots on the TeleVideo 803, but you can 
use an external modem with any of several excellent 
communications software packages.  Three of the best are public 
domain.  They are IMP245, MEX114, and QTERM43 all of which are 
usable on the 803.  The necessary overlays are available on many 
RCP/Ms across the country.

>Thanks in advance

You're welcome.  BTW, my BBS (number in signature file) offers 
TeleVideo CP/M support.  There is also a lot of public domain 
software available (both generic and TeleVideo specific).  I also 
have users and technical manuals for the TeleVideo 803 and 
several other TeleVideo computers, for sale.  Let me know if I 
can help you or your bother-in law get some use out of the 803.  
Take care.

Message-ID: <W8SDZ.12709737560.BABYL@WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL>

[File: SIMTEL20.INF                   Last revised: June 28, 1991]

   [Note: Due to disk space limitations the PC-Blue collection
   is temporarily off-line.  We are sorry for the inconvenience
   to our users.]

                     THE SIMTEL20 ARCHIVES

OVERVIEW

There is a colossal amount of free public domain and shareware
software for the CP/M, PCDOS/MSDOS, Macintosh, and UNIX operating
systems, and for the DoD standard programming language, Ada, in
several archives on WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL (IP host 192.88.110.20),
a DECSYSTEM-20 running the TOPS-20 operating system at White Sands
Missile Range, New Mexico.  Archives of correspondence for several
mailing lists are also available.

    [SIMTEL20 is a contraction of SIMulation and TELeprocessing, the
    name of the branch that originally purchased the machine and in
    whose building the system still resides, and the "20" in
    DECSYSTEM-20.  The convention of including the "20" in some form
    or another was popular with other DECSYSTEM-20 systems at the time
    SIMTEL20 was named, such as MIT-XX at MIT and SCORE at Stanford.]

You can obtain these files using the InterNet file transfer protocol,
FTP (described in a following paragraph), with user-name "anonymous".
For a login password, use "guest", your host-name, or any other string
of printing characters.  Throughout this message, FTP examples are
given in a GENERIC syntax.  You will have to consult either local
documentation or your friendly system wizard to learn the actual
syntax used with your local mainframe operating system.  For the sake
of brevity, the full host name "WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL" will be
dropped from further references to SIMTEL20 in this discussion.  Also
please note that square brackets may be used in place of angle brackets
in referring to directory names.  For example, pd1:[msdos.filedocs]
is the same as pd1:<msdos.filedocs>

There are many helpful files in the default ANONYMOUS ftp directory.
Please look at these if you have need for further information on
specific collections.

To obtain directory listings, connect to SIMTEL20 via FTP and get
these files:

  pd1:<msdos>msdos.crclst
  pd1:<pc-blue>pc-blue.crclst
  pd2:<cpm>cpm.crclst
  pd2:<cpmug>cpmug.crclst
  pd2:<sigm>sigm.crclst
  pd8:<hz100>hz100.crclst
  pd9:<macintosh>macintosh.crclst
  pd8:<misc>misc.crclst
  pd6:<unix-c>unix-c.crclst
  pd7:<ada>ada.crc

There is also a comma-delimited directory listing in each top-level
directory, FILES.IDX, which is suitable for importing into a database
program.  This file may be of greater use than the crclst files
because it can be compared against an earlier version of the same file
to produce a complete list of files added and deleted from the
archives.  Using the comma-delimited fields it is possible to build a
script for FTP to maintain a parallel archive.  FILES.IDX can be
printed or displayed with a simple BASIC program.  For more information
see PD1:<MSDOS.FILEDOCS>AAAREAD.ME.

The <CPM>, <MSDOS>, and <MACINTOSH> archives are the ones to watch for
the very latest offerings, as they are updated frequently.

The <CPMUG>, <SIGM> and <PC-BLUE> archives contain software distributed
by the CP/M Users Group, the SIG/M Users Group and the PC-Blue Users
Group respectively.  This software is available on diskettes from the
associated user groups, and the archives are updated as new volumes
are issued.  The <PC-BLUE> archive contains software for the IBM-PC
and similar machines.

The <MSDOS> archives also contain software for the MSDOS and PCDOS
operating systems; but these archives are locally managed, and
therefore are updated more frequently than the <PC-BLUE> archive.

The <UNIX-C> archive contains a variety of UNIX tools.  Those which
apply specifically to CP/M are in the directory <UNIX-C.CPM>.

The <ADA> archive is growing rapidly. Information about this archive
is in directory PD7:<ADA.GENERAL>.  In general, the archived software
is very good, having been worked-over and refined by many users.  The
documentation and comments tend to be complete and informative.

Files in all of these archives can be obtained using the FTP procedures
described in this message.

PLEASE NOTE:  Due to the large number of files available, the archive
maintainers cannot possibly attempt to validate the proper operation of
the various programs.  When a program bug is reported, immediate action
is taken to either correct the error or remove the offending program
from the archives.  Still, users must understand that all archive
programs are offered AS IS, and the archive maintainers specifically
disclaim any liability should these programs malfunction or cause
damage, incidental or otherwise.  When testing ANY new software, be
certain that all information stored on disk is backed-up before you
start, so that you can recover if files are damaged or erased.  This is
particularly true if you have a hard disk, in which case malfunctions
can be spectacularly disasterous.

FILE TYPES

Files are stored in two formats: Text files such as those with names
that end with DOC, HEX, INF and ASM are sometimes stored as ASCII
files, but sometimes these files are stored in binary compressed
form.  Binary storage is also used for executable (COM and EXE) and
library/archive files  (LBR and ARC).  All binary data are stored as
four 8-bit bytes per 36-bit SIMTEL20 word, with the low-order four
bits of each word filled with zeros.  If such a file is interpreted
as a contiguous string, as will happen if a straight binary transfer
is made to a 16 or 32-bit UNIX machine, the four zero filler-bits per
36-bit group will cause rather bizarre and frustrating results.

For information on ARC, ARK, LZH, ZIP, ZOO, LBR, squeezed and crunched files,
get PD2:<CPM.STARTER-KIT>00-FILES.DOC and/or PD1:<MSDOS.STARTER>00-FILES.DOC.

Although the type of storage used for a particular file can usually be
inferred from the file-name, this is not always true.  It is a good idea
to check the appropriate "crclst" of "idx" file to ascertain the storage
format used for each file of interest.  Now, and for the foreseeable
future, storage formats for files in the <SIGM>, <CPMUG> and <PC-BLUE>
archives can be determined from their "generation numbers", as shown by
the FTP directory command.  For example, the FTP command:

  dir pd1:<pc-blue.vol001>

will yield results of the form:

  -CATALOG.001.2
  ABSTRACT.001.2
  BW.ASM.2
  BW.BAS.1
  BW.EXE.1
  COLOR.ASM.2
  COLOR.BAS.1
  COLOR.EXE.1
  ...and so on

All files with names ending in ".1" are stored in binary format, and
those with names ending in ".2" are stored in ASCII.  This relationship
will continue to apply for files in the <SIGM>, <CPMUG> and <PC-BLUE>
archives until further notice.

WARNING: Because the public domain archives on SIMTEL20 consume a huge
amount of disk space, storage capacity will be conserved by the
greatest practical use of libraries, archives, crunched and squeezed
files, all of which are stored in binary format.  If you cannot
properly transfer binary files, you are going to be VERY FRUSTRATED!
If you need help, please contact your local system wizard and provide
him/her with a copy of this message.  Having done that, if you are
still unable to make things work correctly, send a message to
Action@WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL and someone will try to help you.
Please provide the following information:

 1. Machine and operating system  (e.g., VAX-11/780, 4.3 BSD UNIX)
 2. Network software in use  (e.g., 3-Com UNET)
 3. Complete list of available FTP commands  (e.g., GET, PUT, etc.)

Important files in the <CPMUG> and <PC-BLUE> archives are the
CATALOG files. These files, which are stored in ASCII, contain the
"-CATALOG.nnn" files from all the volumes of their respective archives.
To obtain these composite catalog files, connect to SIMTEL20 via FTP
and get these files:

  pd2:<cpmug>cpmug.cat
  pd1:<pc-blue.vol000>pcblue.cat

Similar files exist for the <SIGM> archive, but they are stored in
squeezed form.  These files, when unsqueezed, yields SIG0.CAT and
SIG1.CAT (the catalog).

  pd2:<sigm.vol000>sig0.cqt
  pd2:<sigm.vol000>sig1.cqt

(NOTE: That's "L-and-three-zeros" in "vol000")

FILE TRANSFER VIA FTP

FTP stands for File Transfer Protocol, a formalized procedure for
moving files among machines on the Defense Data Network (DDN) and other
networks that connect with the DDN.  The protocol is implemented by a
program often called FTP.  The different mainframe operating systems
implement FTP with variations in command syntax.  Some systems have the
remote-file-name precede the local-file-name in the command.  Others
reverse this order.  Some versions have the whole command on a single
input line, while others use multiple lines.  Read the documentation
for your local system, or consult a friendly system wizard for the
details of your local FTP command syntax.

UNIX users can do something like "man ftp" for on-line instructions.
However, not all UNIX FTP programs are called "ftp", so you may have
to snoop around in the system directories or ask a system wizard for
the correct local name to use with the "man" command.  ITS users can
do ":INFO FTP", and "HELP FTP" works on TOPS-20 and some other
operating systems.  I will be happy to update this message with
pointers to other sources of on-line documentation if they are sent
to w8sdz@WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL.

FTP transfers from SIMTEL20 can be made with user-name "anonymous".
Use GUEST for the password.  For anonymous logins, SIMTEL20 supports
the FTP "change working directory" command.  (Your local syntax may
be something like CD, or CWD).  Ignore the message which may appear
that prompts you to enter a password.  This command allows you to
specify a default SIMTEL20 directory to be used for all file
retrievals, and thereby relieves you from having to repeatedly type
"pdx:<whatever>" as part of each filename.  For example, you can do
something like this:

  cd pd1:<msdos.goodstuff>
  get filename-1
  get filename-2
  ...and so on

instead of using the longer filename forms shown in previous examples.

Users of TOPS-10, TENEX, or TOPS-20 systems can use "image" or "paged"
mode for ALL transfers.  UNIX and other users must use "ascii" mode for
ASCII files, and "type tenex" or "type L 8" mode for binary files.

All aspects of the FTP process for UNIX machines have been automated
to a high degree by two programs in directory PD8:<MISC.UNIX>. With
these programs, a simple command like "sh autoftp30.sh mylist &" can
be run in no-hangup background mode to transfer multiple files from
SIMTEL20 without the user remaining logged-in on the local system.
For more information, get the file PD8:<MISC.UNIX>AUTOFTP30.TAR-Z, a
compressed tar archive.  After transferring it to your Unix host,
rename to autoftp30.tar.Z, uncompress, and extract with tar.  Also
see BATCHFTP102.TAR-Z which is an enhanced version of autoftp.

MAILING LIST CORRESPONDENCE ARCHIVES

Copies of correspondence for several mailing lists are kept on SIMTEL20
in directories with names of the form PD2:<ARCHIVES.KEYWORD>, where
"KEYWORD" has been chosen to indicate the associated mailing list.  At
present, the following correspondence archives are available:

   mailing list       mail archive filename
  ---------------     ---------------------
  ADA-SW              PD2:<ARCHIVES.ADA-SW>
  AMETHYST-USERS      PD2:<ARCHIVES.AMETHYST>

  UNIX-SW             PD2:<ARCHIVES.UNIX-SW>
  VIDEOTECH           PD2:<ARCHIVES.VIDEOTECH>

Descriptions of these and other mailing lists can be obtained via FTP
with anonymous login (as for SIMTEL20) from FTP.NISC.SRI.COM.  Ask for
the file netinfo/interest-groups (an ASCII file).  And please note,
this is NOT on SIMTEL20.

File names for SIMTEL20 mailing list correspondence archives have two
forms.  For example, in PD2:<ARCHIVES.CPM>, which holds the INFO-CPM
correspondence (the "INFO-" is assumed), the forms are: yymm.n-TXT or
yymm.n-TXT-Z.  Files with names ending in -Z were compressed with a
Unix compress-compatible program.  The characters "yymm" in the file
names are the digits of the year and month of the messages in each
particular file.  The "n" was incremented as overflowed 150 disk pages
(approximately 375K).  The current month's correspondence is kept in
CPM-ARCHIV.TXT, which is constantly growing as new messages arrive.
There may also temporarily exist files named CURRENT.n-TXT, which hold
the overflow of the current month's messages when CPM-ARCHIV.TXT is
split into monthly files.  Although INFO-CPM has been used as an
example here, the same naming scheme is used for the other mailing list
files as well.  For a complete list of available files, connect to
SIMTEL20 via FTP and do this:

  dir PD2:<ARCHIVES>

You will receive a list of names of the form:

  KEYWORD.DIRECTORY.n

where "n" is one or more digits.  For example, the INFO-CPM listing
currently appears as "CPM.DIRECTORY.1"  To then get a list of files in
a particular archive, do this:

  dir PD2:<ARchives.keyword>

where "keyword" (for example, "cpm") is chosen from the preceding list,
and the word "directory" and the number "n" are not used.  At present,
all of these files are stored in ASCII.

Message-ID: <1991Aug16.024320.17226@cbnewsh.cb.att.com>

For sale: Osborne I CP/M computer, software, and books

I won't describe the basic Osborne I configuration; if you don't
already know what an O-1 is, then you probably shouldn't go after this
offer.  It ain't no "compatible" PC!  On the other hand, if you're
interested and have questions, feel free to get in touch.

I got this machine in (probably) '82 and used it regularly for a few
years.  It's been closed up since '86, but I fired it up today and it
still works great.  I'd like to sell it to someone who knows what
they're getting into.  I need the space more than I need the money, so
make a fair offer and feel free to embellish in the hope that I'll go
for some low sucker price (but I do have my pride: it cost me $1300
[at the time a "fire sale" price] for the machine, plus all the extras
I accumulated along the way).  If you're part of some nonprofit
organization that's already using Osbornes (or at least CP/M
machines), I would consider donating this in exchange for a tax
receipt.

FEATURES:
	blue case
	ROM version 1.44
	clean (really clean, not junky, not even dusty)
	external video jack [see VIDEO NOTE]
	double density disk upgrade
	all the original s/w and docs, even the original carton the
	     thing came in
	rear-vent fan thingy (I forget the official name of this)
	parallel printer adaptor cable
	joystick adaptor (this works with a couple of the games I
	     have, but today I can't find the adaptor itself; if I
	     find it later, it's yours)

VIDEO NOTE: The external video output is part of the 52/80/100 board
(Osborne ScreenPac), but the rest of the board never worked right.
Still the external video jack works, and you can have both the
built-in monitor and an external monitor working at the same time; no
funny plug to play around with.  I also have the "exmon" adaptor (the
funny plug that is used to switch between internal and external
monitors); I don't recall if it works.  I have an amber monitor that I
used to use with this.  It's a USI PS3.  It used to be considered
hi-res, but certainly wouldn't be today.  If you want the monitor,
make an offer.

SOFTWARE:  In addition to the stuff that all Osborne I's came with
(WordStar 2.26, SuperCalc, CBASIC, MBASIC) and a lot of mid-80's
vintage public domain stuff, here's some other (mostly commercial)
software that I got over the years.  This is all legally acquired and
I still have complete original documentation for most of it.

	The Micro Link (v 1.1) [comm program]
	Personal Pearl [relational database program, 7 disks!]
	Media Master (v 3.00s) [foreign disk reader/writer]
	Small MAC [macro assembler]
	Z80ASM (SLR Systems)
	C/80 compiler (v 3.1)
	C/80 mathpack (v 3.1)
	Nevada FORTRAN
	Z80 Cross Assembler (2500AD Software)
	MIX Editor
	MIX ASM Utility
	WordStar Release 4 upgrade (never tried; disks still sealed)
	Microsoft Basic Compiler (BASCOM) (v 5.30), includes M-80
	    macro assembler and L-80 linker
	SCG22 [source code generator for CP/M 2.2]

Besides all this, you get to stroll down memory lane and relive early
microcomputer history as you look at the odd collection of disks and
sleeves in the 50-100 other disks that come with it.

I also have a ton of documentation for the Osborne and for CP/M in
general:

	Osborne I Technical Manual (includes ROM/BIOS listings)
	Osdex (index to O1 user's manual)
	Sams Computerfacts: OCC1, OCC1A (schematics, etc)
	Don't (Or How to Care for Your Computer)
	Microprocessor Interfacing Techniques

	More TRS-80 Assembly Language
	8080A-8085 Assembly Language Programming
	Programming the Z80

	The Programmer's CP/M Handbook
	The CP/M Plus Handbook
	Osborne CP/M User Guide
	Mastering CP/M
	CP/M Operating System Manual (official Digital Research version)

	C Primer Plus (this book sucks)
	CBASIC User Guide
	Payroll with Cost Accounting (includes CBASIC source listing)
	Best of Interface Age, Volume I, Software in BASIC
	Understanding FORTH
	Pocket Guide to FORTH

	Quick and Easy WordStar
	Proportional Spacing on WordStar
	The Small C Handbook
	SuperCalc Primer


I'd prefer to get rid of it in a big heap, but I'd consider doing it
in pieces.  So, like, make me an offer for some or all of this.  Email
preferred, but my daytime phone number is below.

Subject: FREE ALTOS ACS8000/Z80 MP/M SYSTEM
Message-ID: <9108161806.AA12649@alw.nih.gov>

I own a hardworking Altos ACS8000 MP/M (multiuser) machine, which my wife
wants me to dump because it's taking up too much (guest) room.  I want to find
a good home for it with a fellow CP/M buff -- if they'll come to Santa
Barbara, California, and haul it away.

Here are the specs:

It's an Altos ACS8000 with Zilog Z80 microprocessor running MP/M II (V2.1).
It has an ACS 8200 Circuit Board supporting up to 4 concurrent users, with
208K of random access memory: 16K system memory, and 4 banks of 48K user
memory.  It has one (1) Single/Double density 8" floppy drive and a 14"
Winchester 40MB Hard Drive.

Also part of the free package is an Altos Magnetic Tape Unit (MTU-2, CMTD-
3400S2) to backup the hard disk onto 13.4 MB, 1/4", 450-foot, 4 track, high
density magnetic tape cartridges.  The MTU records data at 6400 BPI in serial
recording, Modified Frequency Modulation format, at 192 Kbits/second.

PLUS, a Televideo 925 monitor and TONS of:  manuals, 8" floppies, tape
cartridges, software on and off the hard disk --  a text editor, spell
checker, mail merger, accounting system, ADVENTURE, etc.

Bonus: Color IDS-100 monitor -- its a gas!

All for the low, low price of $0.  Just pick it up in Santa Barbara,
California, promise to love it forever, and haul it home.

Shipping it would be difficult, since I no longer have the padded cartons that
it came in.  Also, I would have to figure out a way to secure the hard disk
head before shipping.  Finally, it's VERY heavy.

I can help you out with the Molecular system. I have 3 systems myself, 
and I use them all the time, I think they are probably the best

Is this what you mean?  Since WordPerfect has never been
released on CP/M, it would take some kind of twisted S.O.B.
to write such a thing, no?  Well, I guess it's possible.

On the small chance you're actually referring to Perfect
Writer files, well, they're straight ASCII already.  (No, I
didn't really think it'd be that easy.)

i'm looking for a cp/m emulator that will run on the

it does not have to be efficient, sleek, or beautiful, but it
does have to be cheap/free and work at least as well as my old
cp/m card on my apple ][.
please send me mail, and if there is enough response, i will post
it for other interested seekers.  even half-remember hints about
where to find an emulator could be entertaining for me, so please
help me out.
thanks,

try Z80MU.  it's PD and it's the best PC CP/M emulator I've ever seen. 
i've got a copyy somewhere, but I'm in the process of moving so everything 
is in shambles.  send me E-Mail if you can't find a copy.  I've got
version 3.10  I've heard that they've released a version 5, but I've also
heard that they've added happy little menus and colors and other crap
that an operating system should never have.  stick with 3.10  it's like
working with CP/M.  

it's also fast..  running on my 25MHz 386, the emulator averages about
a 3MHz Z80a.  which is about what you get with a CP/M machine anyway.

hope that helps..

Are you CERTAIN it's booting off the floppy?  I'm pretty certain
it's booting off the hard drive.  Unless of course you happen to

Have you watched the floppy's activity light (if it even has one,
which is rare these days)?  If it lights up when you reference
the C: drive, that's probably why it appears trashed.

Define "LOTTA stuff".  Try using the command "STAT d:DSK:", where
d: is the drive letter, and that will tell you the capacity of
each "drive".  Check the number next to "Kilobyte Drive
Capacity".  If it's some number above 730,000 then it's your hard
drive partition.  Also you have neglected some very, EXTREMELY
important information.  What model is your Televideo?  Also,
what's the capacity of your hard drive (if you know)?  Without
that information, it will be difficult to help you.

I don't think you'll have all that much trouble.  There are
probably quite a few Televid users out there...

I'm not entirely sure that's a "parallel" printer port.  It may
just be a serial port.

Hold on a sec, son.  A DB-25 connector is not necessarily an
"RS-232c" connector.  In fact, I can tell you right now, it is
not.  It's just the most commonly used connector for a serial
port.  "RS-232C", or its more verbose name, "Recommended Standard
232 Revision C", is nothing more than a document recommending
standards for serial communications put out by the Electronic
Industry of America (EIA).  The connector doesn't say it's
"RS-232".  In fact, the connector is used all the time for
parallel ports on IBM and compatible machines as well for serial
ports.  Conversely, not all RS-232C ports use DB-25 connectors.
On most AT's, a male DB-9 is used.  On Macintoshes, Apple II GSs,
and Apple IIc Pluses, they use an 8-pin mini-DIN (Deutsche
Industrie Norm) jack.  On some computers like the Dynabyte
Monarch and the AT&T 3B2/400, modular jacks are used.

Conclusion:  BE ---*** V E R Y ***--- CAREFUL WHAT YOU PLUG INTO
WHATEVER PORT YOU PLUG A PERIPHERAL IN!!!!!!  I fried a parallel
printer on my XT by plugging the cable that goes between the back
of the case and the card with a DB-25 at one end and a 16-pin DIP
header at the other end to the game connector on the multi-I/O
card.

Again, you should have stated what kind of gear for those of us
"who just joined us" to know what the heck is going on.  I might
be able to help because I might have some Televid docs floating
around.

there isn't such a beast for CP/M, although it would be a trivial hack to
do it...  however, there is a little program; convert.exe that is included
in WordPerfect that changes just about everything into something else..
use is self explanatory..  

on the off chance that ASCII isn't listed, just go into WordPerfect and
press ^F5 and select 1:Save text or somethin.. this saves as ASCII.

Hmmm.  I've always been able to install ZDE.  Every version I've
gotten ALWAYS had an installation program.  Try looking for a
program called "ZDENSTxx.COM" where XX is the current version.

Free to good home (close to Adelaide South Australia)......

	1 Fergusson (sp?) BB1 z80 computer in Bullet proof
	  Metal case with 220VAC power supply

	2 Shugart 8" floppy drives in similar cases

	Various cables, etc and a Parallel Keyboard.

	No monitor, but you need one (composite I believe)

	NO boot disks or future support (sorry)


I'm moving back to San Diego and will be taking my Kaypros with me, but
this "boat anchor" will remain ANCHORED in SA most likely....

Boot disks available from the Keeper of the System disks (I hope) in S.D.
(Well, maybe a little support in a month or so, ;-) )

I paid 20$Aus for it, but never got around to playing with it!  So if you
want to come by & see it, we can enjoy an Export or a Coopers Ale together
while we warm our toes in front of it....

Cromemco Computer Equipment for sale... (CHEAP!)

        A friend of mine gave me a bunch of Cromemco computer equipment, 
manuals, and some disks. I have run out of space and am getting ready 
to donate it to charity. If you are interrested in anything lease E-mail
me. Any offer that covers shipping and is worth my while (vs a very minor
tax write-off) if fine.

3 Cromemco C10 computers with disk drives: These are Z80 based computers
with monitors that run CDOS (Comemco's enhansed version of CP/M) and
have external Tandon full height double sided/double density disk drives.

1 Cromemco CS1HD: This is a 68000 based system that runs Cromix (Cromemco's
version of UNIX). It is full of S100 boards and is complete except for the
hard drive. It could also have the above C10 computers hooked up to it as
terminals.

Lots of books (service manuals, DBASE II, operating systems, etc) and some
back-up disks.

Alternatively, does there exist a decent screen editor known to work on

     ICL CRT Terminal: 12" Green Phosphor display, 80 Columns by
     24 Rows, with a 25th status line. It came with an ICL Multi-
     user MP/M system, and seems to emulate TeleVideo's Model 950
     quite closely. Appearance-wise, it is beige in colour, and
     similar in shape and style to TeleVideo 925/950/TS-800A and
     early DEC terminals. There are three sets of eight
     dipswitched on the rear panel, and I've tried various
     combinations with no avail... I would like to change the
     baud-rate settings, and the character set to US-English, as
     the terminal runs at 9600 Baud, and uses the UK-English
     (British) character set. Help!

Thanks to all of you who have provided information on my friend's
Televideo 803.  It's been a big help.

Now as for the modem he needs.....

I understand that this unit can only use an external modem.  Are 
these modems species specific to cp/m machines, or can we purchase
any Hayes compatible unit (or are they just for MS-DOS machines?)

If we can't get something new, I imagine we'll be hunting the electronics
surplus stores or flea markets.  Where else might one look for used old
modems for televideos?

Thanks in advance

Vdo is good. Has the main WS commands, edits in memory and is 10k long.
I can mail it to you if you like or ring me on 042 85 2063 for

I did this also.  "Hayes Compatible" mainly means the modem will execute a
set of character commands for modem setup, dialing and storing phone numbers,
etc.  Be sure you get a copy of the commands; they should be listed in the
manual, and many are prefixed "/at" (I think).  You may have to remember
a few commands if you need to use the modem in the non-default condition, and
others such as stored dialing sequences, are also handy.  My terminal
emulator did not store any commands or setups itself, but other cp/m terminal
utilities may do so.

Subject: CP/M and the Coleco ADAM
Message-ID: <1991Aug22.183124.10189@usenet.ins.cwru.edu>

	This is just a feeler post to see how many (if any) ADAM
users are out there.  Locally (Cleveland, Ohio USA) our users
group has a lot of activity with ADAM CP/M 2.2 and a PD rewrite
of CP/M called TDOS 4.58 (which accesses all the 3rd-party
hardware developed for the ADAM after Coleco went bankrupt, like
320K/720K/1.2M/1.44M disk drives, 10/20/40/60M hard drives,
RS232 cards, parallel printers, and paged memory expanders up to
1 meg).  Most ADAM CP/Mers/TDOSers use 80-column serial terminals
to avoid the ugly screen shifting right-and-left necessitated
by ADAM's 40-column video chip (under TDOS; ADAM CP/M 2.2 used a
graphics mode of the VDP to get a whopping 31 columns).  WordStar
3.0 is a big favorite for word processing, and there is a CP/M
version of dBASE which has much use.

	All in all, our orphan ADAM is not doing too badly in
a few key centers in Canada and the USA.  And not just with CP/M
and TDOS---there have been many utility, graphics, game and
computer languages written lately in ADAM's internal EOS opera-
ting system.

	I have programmed PDP-11/34s, IBM xx86s and Macintoshes;
but I have *REALLY* learned how to program hardware from my
Z80 programming on my 64K ADAM with 16K of VRAM, 2 256K digital
data drives (mini cassette-based file-structured magtape) and
2 160K single-sided floppies.

	WordStar 1.0 for the IBM-PC was a 26K .COM file ported
over from the CP/M version.  What is WordStar 5.0, 300K of
bloated, compiled C or Turbo Pascal?  8-bit microprocessor
programmers are probably the last group of real assembly
language programmers left (except for maybe a few OS programmers
at MicroSoft and Apple).  I hope the few of us remaining
continue to maintain CP/M; it is not a bad OS by any means.
UNIX is not the Philosopher's Stone!  :)

Subject: cpm undelete function and more....
Message-ID: <1991Aug21.172238.6894@hfsi.uucp>

I have a request for you CPM guru's out in netland.

I have a friend who owns a Kaypro/10 CPM machine.  She just called
and told me the following:

While I was in WordStar (version unknown), I noticed I had a bunch of
old files and I deleted them.  When I left Wordstar and went back to me
menu [system], I got the outline of the menu but didn't get the inside
of the menu.  [These are her descriptions, not mine.]  I think everything
is still there because I can escape out of the menu and still get to
Wordstar from the A0.  I talked to a company in Arlington and described my
problem and they told me they could recover the menu system but it would
cost about $90.

The questions I have are:

short term:

1) Is there an undelete type command that can be used on a CPM machine?  If so,
   where do I get it and how do I get it on a floppy that the CPM machine
   can read?

2) Is there another way to recover the menu "insides"?

long term:

1) Is there any easy way to get the data files that she has under Wordstar
   in some form that they are importable into an IBm machine if she upgrades?

    Suggestions, comments are certainly appreciated.  Thanks in advance.

You're absolutely right.  Most CP/M machines have nothing more

The answer to your question about whether you could use any
Hayes-compatible unit, in a word, YES.  You can use a Hayes
compatible modem on ANY computer, terminal, or other peripheral
with an RS-232 port.

Remember, most external modems are not for any specific computer.
As long as it has an RS-232C port, you're in the clear.  Case in
point; I used an Atari SX-212 which not only had the 13-pin Atari
connector for 8-bit computers, it had an RS-232C port so I could
plug it into anything with an RS-232 port, which included an
Apple //e.  I also had it plugged into my S-100 box.

It sounds as if the "Company in Arlington" is running a scam, and that your
friend deleted one of the WS overlay files from her hard disk. Depending
on the version she has, she may need WSHELP.OVR, WSMSGS.OVR, WS.OVR, and
WSPRINT.OVR to be available. All she needs to do, probably, is copy the
missing overlay (WS*.OVR) file(s) from her original floppies to her
hard drive.

Message-ID: <1991Aug23.172837.303@wpi.WPI.EDU>

I believe I have just hit the jackpot on this one...

Earlier today at work, I was handed a box of books about CP/M.  Many of these
books actually deal with the operating system itself and give helpful
information about BDOS calls and so on.  One book goes so far as to give an
assembly language listing of a program that will (insert trumpet fanfare here)
undelete a file!  Since I am at work, it would not be appropriate for me to
type it in right now.  However, I promise that I will type it in and post it
sometime during this weekend.

The title of this book is "CP/M Revealed" by Jack D. Dennon, and it is
published by the Hayden Book Company, Inc. of New Jersey, copyright 1982. It
also gives a library of Congress entry in the beginning of the book, which I
will post if there are any interested parties. 

As to the copyright, I seriously doubt that this book is still available from
the publisher, so I don't see what harm I can do by republishing a small
portion of it.  If anyone can convince me otherwise before I post the source
code, I will consider assembling it on my system and just posting the
executable code in uuencoded format.

In the meantime, let me just paraphrase the information at the beginning of
the chapter, which may prove useful to some of you out there...

To erase a file in CP/M, the hex value E5 is entered into byte 00 of each
extent of the file in the disk directory.  Also, all the record blocks
reserved for the file in the RBR are released.

>Greetings, Bert

I seem to darkly remember that it is also reversed, i.e. the command  to be
executed first is the last one in the list. Correct me on this, if I'm
wrong. (I might correct myself. I'll turn on my CP/M system tonight to test
on this).

If you need documentation, let me know, as I am also the proud parent of
one of these (assembled from the original kit c. 1977).  When you solder
one of these babies together you know why they call it a "motherboard".

Right now the system is packed carefully away, with tender regard to it's
historical significance, but most of the documentation is accessable. The
main OS I was running was Northstar Basic, although just before we started
upgrading, I put on CP/M 1.4, but never got much software due to the dearth
of hard-sectored diskettes.

Every public release of ZDE has been in CP/M library form
(ZDExx.LBR).  I've always included the installer in the library.
If you're getting ZDE without the installer, someone has done
you (and probably others) a disservice, and I'd like to know more
about it.

I suggest you check out "Vulcan's Computer Monthly" -- it should have some
information on companies that support TRS-80s.  I have several, and I've used
CP/M on at least a model 4, I'm not sure what needs to be done to use CP/M
on a model 3 (maybe some extra ram).  There are still wordprocessors
available for even non-CP/M (TRS-DOS) users (gasp! and in info-cpm too :-)
so I could look up some addresses if you can't get that magazine.  It has
a monthly column on TRS-80s, and is quite good.

The intent was to use MAIL.COM as a common interface, that's why news
gets dumped into .MAI files. In essence what you're looking for is a
replacement for MAIL.COM that has a better user interface, and can
invoke an editor. Suffice it to say that this is on my list of things

On a further topic, I saw a posting from someone called Thorbejorn
(sorry, I spelled it wrong :-( ), and tried posting a reply. As before,
my reply will not reach Europe because of the "distribution" problem.
Can you re-post your message, and I'll try to get a reply back to you

Well, I've got the 806 cpu back from the shop. Not on;y was there
no short, but it is now worse off than before. Now it boots off
the floppy after the 3rd reset, but "dir" only shows 1 file on
any disk, and in most cases only part of that filename. Only
by going thru the alphabet (i.e: dir a*.*; dir b*.*; etc) can I
determine what files are on any disk. The harddrive is completely
gorfed. I get screenfuls of "Bios errors", "read errors", etc,
and have to shut it off to start all over again. Does anyone out
there have an 806, that will send me a sysgen'ed disk, with
hdformat and sysgen.com on it? In return, assuming that fixes
it, I'll send a copy of every file I got for this system! I would
really prefer it to be from an 806, I don't wanna take any 
chances with differences between 802's, 803's, etc and the 806.

I have an undelete utility that I *think* is a public domain utility
(Actually I don't remember where it came from at this point.)  It is for
a kaypro II.  If you want to pursue it, send me mail.

Humm. From what I believe, there's copies of ZSM.LBR (or ZSM23.LBR) drifting
around that are corrupt. If you want the most up to date version, it can
be requested from the rna server here on pallio. Send mail containing this
line:

/send zsm to your.address.here

where you fill in your address as shown. Note that I can't guarantee
Internet addresses, so yourt best bet is to use an address of the form:

hoptoad!host.domain!user

where the first site is a Bay Area UUCP <--> Internet gateway. hoptoad,
decwrl, ucbvax and pacbell are a few possibilities. I will make sure that
the LIB.L in this file is the most up to date available, so there should
not be any problems. Also, I'll make sure LIB.DOC is not corrupt.

Paul Martin adds:
> This probably came from me. I got it from SIMTEL20.

I wish you hadn't said that. If the version on SIMTEL20 is shot we're
in real trouble. Hey Mike Freeman - are you listening? Can you:

A: grab the latest ZSM from pallio!rna (or from GEnie - I'll re-upload
   in the next couple of days)
B: submit it to SIMTEL20 under the name ZSM23.LBR
C: see if you can delete the file that's currently on SIMTEL20

And Thorbjoern Ravn Andersen says:

Aha - this is the message I was missing (kudos to Dan Becker for forwarding
these posts on to me)

Anyway, it does sound like the patch area is not correct. Thorbjoern,
can you mail me both the ZMP patch and the QTERM patch that you're trying.
with both of those, I may be able to create something that will work for
you.

 Dear ACMers....
        I am doing some research that includes an opinion survey.
 I want input from as many students, faculty, University staff and
 private sector programmers as I can get in and out of the U.S.
        Those of you in industry please distribute the survey to
 co-workers as your group is very important to my research and you
 are hard to find.
        Please place an asterisk (*) to the left of your response on the
 survey form and send it back to me.  E-Mail responses will be EXTRACTED
 without the header so that anonymity can be preserved.  Or if you
 prefer my U.S. Mail address is also below.
        Here's your big chance to become a statistic !!
        Thank you ALL for your participation.

 A.      Your Personal Attitude  (be as objective as possible)
 
                                    Always               Never
 
 1.      I use GOTOs.                  1    2    3    4    5
 
                               Strongly Agree      Strongly Disagree
 
 2.      Error Branching and
         subprogram calls are
         really GOTOs.                1    2    3    4    5
 
 3.      Languages without GOTOs
         are superior languages.
                                                     1    2    3    4    5
 
 4.      BASIC is a bad language
         and should be eliminated
         from use.                                1    2    3    4    5
 
 5.      I believe that GOTOs are:
 
         1. bad.  My experience with them is: they are hard to follow.
         2. bad.  My experience with them is: code is hard to maintain.
         3. bad.  I believe their use yields unstructured code.
        4. bad.  I was taught to reguard them as such.
        5. good. I find them clear and easy to follow.
         6. good. They make it easy to change the program flow.
         7. necessary.  Neither good nor bad.
 
 6.      My first programming language was:
 
         1. Ada
         2. Assymbly
         3. BASIC
         4. C
         5. COBOL
         6. ForTran
         7. Pascal
         8. other
 
 7.      I wrote my first program:
 
         1. Within the last 12 months
         2. 2-5 years ago
         3. 6-10 years ago
         4. 11-20 years ago
         5. 21-30 years ago
         6. over 30 years ago
 
 8.      I have been programming full time for:
 
         1. less than 1 year
         2. 2-5 years
         3. 6-10 years
         4. 11-20 years
         5. 21-30 years
         6. over 30 years
 
                                        Strongly Agree      Strongly Disagree
 
 
 9.      I have found that what is taught
         and the industry reality are two
         different things.             1    2    3    4    5
 
 10.     University topics in computer
         science lag behind the
         functional realities they
         try to teach.                 1    2    3    4    5

Well folks, I apologize but I didn't type in the program this past weekend. 
There are two main reasons: 1) As someone rightly pointed out to me, there are
several PD versions available, so why go through the effort.  2) I forgot the
box of books at work over the weekend...

If anyone really, really wants the assembly source for an undelete program, I
will consider typing it in and distributing it.

Sorry, I have to correct myself.  On SIMTEL there is in PD2:<CPM.ARC-LBR>
directory a new version of LT, LT30.LBR, which decodes *.?Y? files.
In PD2:<CPM.SQUSQ> directory there is a new version of LZH
encoder/decoder, TLZH20.LBR.  According to date stamping their upload
was on August 12, 1991.  I must have missed announcement of that
upload.

Subject: Re: Format of file $$$.SUB ??
Message-ID: <46156@cup.portal.com>

The $$$.SUB file contains a reverse ordered list of the commands
in FOO.SUB.  For example..

In foo.sub you have cpm commands, one per line..

pip b:=a:foo.bar
era a:foo.bar
dir b:

These commands will be written, one per record, last command first, to
$$$.SUB in Function 10 format, ie..  byte 0 is the length of the command,
then the command, then a terminating nul.

06H,"DIR B:",0H
0DH,"ERA A:FOO.BAR",0H
10H,"PIP B:=A:FOO.BAR",0H

The command processor (CCP) reads the $$$.SUB file,  places the last record
in the command line buffer and removes the last record from the file.
The command is executed and the CCP reads $$$.SUB again...  until it is
empty.

Hi,

      you will find your "un-squeezer" in archive sites by anonymous ftp:
try Washington Univ:
      wuarchive.wustl.edu (= 128.252.135.4), cd to mirrors/cpm/squsq and
      look for library which starts somthing like LTZH....  It will have
      a file LT29.COM (or later version) which will do your *.?Y?
or try SIMTEL:
      wmsr-Simtel20.army.mil (= 192.88.110.20), cd to PD2:<CPM.SQUSQ>, set
      TENEX mode and do as above.

      There are other "uncrunchers" which will do *.?Y? but I do not
remember their name.   I think it starts UNCRZHL (?) and I do not know
the directory.  I downloaded the program some time ago.  That UNC... will
crunch your file to *.?Y?, but the process is much slower than for *.?Z?.
Files crunched to *.?Y? are usually about 10% smaller than *.?Z?.

Subject: Source Code for Unsqueezer
Message-ID: <1991Aug27.231755.1735@usenet.ins.cwru.edu>

Hi.
There has been a bit of a discussion of unsqueezing files
here lately. Unfortunately, most of the programs available
are already in .COM format.
Does anyone know where source code is available from that I
can run on a Unix system? I tried one version from the
University of Iowa, but it gives segmentation faults as soon
as the output file is opened.
 
Thanks for any help I can get.

Scott Marshall.

I have some files that have names like *.cym and *.dyc, presumably
the result of some compression tecnique. Now I have seen .?q? and .?z?
formats, but how do I unpack the .?y? files?

Thanks in advance.

On Simtel-20, there is an unerasing program,
pd2:<cpm.dirutl>uneraz11.lbr, that should fill the bill if the user has
a Z80 CPU. There is now a UNERAZ12.LBR; I'll try to get it and upload
it to Simtel. There's also a rather slick UNDELETE.LBR whose program
checks for duplicate files and files whose first extent is gone. I've
got it at home; will dig it out also.
Cheers!

Subject: cp/m software availability
Message-ID: <1991Aug30.170252.14350@spool.cs.wisc.edu>

I've been wondering about the availability of CP/M
software and documentation.  I've seen the "cp/m compilers"
list posted here, but I was wondering if any other cpm
software is still available, for example, what about the 
z-system and its' various utilities, editors, linkers, etc.

I'm asking because i'm considering using a sb180 or an old
s-100 system that I can pick up as a native "development"
system for a dedicated z80 controller project, and I would like to know
if there is software out there (editors, z-system, assemblers, etc)
that I can do the work with.

thanks for any help

CRR0120.ZIP     Fidonet offline message reader for XRS-Door

CRR version 1.20 is the CP/M offline reader for use anywhere XRS might
be used on an MSDOS machine. It allows you to download messages from a
conforming QBBS, RemoteAccess or SuperBBS Fidonet bulletin board. In
order to use this software you will need an archiving program (eg. ARK
or ARC), an archive extractor (eg. UNARC), and a text editor (eg. VDE
or ZDE).  Dave Goodenough's UNZIP program is included in the archive.

I recently picked up an Osborne portable (sort of!) computer at a Salvation Army
store for $25.  I have no information on this computer except that the little
metal plate glued to the back tells me that it's an Osborne Computer Corporation
model OCC 1.  I have determined that a boot disk is required, but that's about
all I know about this computer.  If anyone can help me, please E-mail me at
kipp@sgl.ists.ca.  I would like to know where I could find a boot disk,
technical information, user's references, programming quides, anything that
might allow me to do something with this computer (other that reduce it to spare
parts!).

Dear Eric A. Rasmussen and all other wizzards in this group.
The  *undelete*  function mentioned in the Subject line, might
that help me with the following?

A dear friend of mine has typed in a archeological manuscript 
of 50 pages on an Amstrad word processor running CP/M equiped 
with a somewhat obscure drive for rectangular discs. Error: something 
like "can't read sektor 0". All other sectors OK (But we don't have
any program to read them). No back up. No sign of shit on the disc. 
One and a half week of full time job to recreate it. The one to give 
a correct hint or a disc-crash recover program will be honored with 
deep gratitude. Any hint pleeeeeease......

Programs like UCRLZH11 or more recently, the programs in
CRUNCH28.LBR, will uncrunch them.  Or EXL will, but I use
UNCRUNCH28.  It will be directly replacing UNCRLZH on my CP/M
machines, and will be my main uncrunher on my MS-DOS machine
using 22NICE to emulate the Z80.  BTW, both uncrunchers will
uncrunch ANYTHING, be it *.?Q?, *.?Z?, or *.?Y?.

The header says it all.  Could someone kindly point me towards a source for
this.  I have a note from the heated discussion stored, but apparently
this is not the final one.

I am intending the 5 1/4 drive to seem to be an 8" drive, so no speed 
changing needed, just (hopefully) a plug-in replacement.

The request includes the switches that tells the drive what number it has

Thank you in advance.

Message-ID: <1991Aug30.184200.28657@bronze.ucs.indiana.edu>

First off, thanks to everyone who helped me with my decompression problem. I
ended up using the program "ucrlzh" from simtel20.

Now for my question: what is the best pd/free/shareware text editor for
CP/M? Primary concerns include small size, speed, and a basic feature set
including cut/paste, rapid movement through the file (by screen/page, or
ideally with some sort of search capability). Ability to do margins,
centering, justification, boldface, etc. is not necessary.  Ideally
(although this is secondary to all the other items) it should have
Emacs-style key bindings. (Has anyone ported MicroEmacs to CP/M?)

This is a sensitive subject, so why don't you send me e-mail rather than
posting; I don't want this group to degenerate into a flame war... I will
summarize my responses after I have had a chance to try out some of the
suggested editors.

In a recent Info-CPM digest, someone mentioned that they were having
trouble with files from ZSM23.LBR (from pd2:<cpm.asmutl>) on Simtel-20.
I downloaded the file from WUARCHIVE and it is indeed corrupt. I have
uploaded to Simtel-20 a good copy of ZSM23.LBR. It's length is 768
sectors and its CRC using CRCK44 is 90C4. This should fix the problem.
