Subject: re: UUENCODE and UUDECODE in Z-80 assembly

	I just realised when I saw the call for a faster UUDECODE
that I have most of the pieces I need to put together such a
program, but I don't fully understand the 'protocol'.  Is there
a protocol document available somewhere?  I sort of get the basic
idea, but there's a number in the first line of the file that
doesn't change with different files, but I've heard changes with
different versions of the encoder, and there's an 'M' as the first
character of every line, and such like that.
 
Many thanks in advance.

Subject:      CP/M on the V20
To:           info CP/M <INFO-CPM@SIMTEL20.ARPA>

I started microcomputing on a self built CP/M machine (I wrote my
own ROM and BIOS). Now I own an IBM PC clone in which I plugged a
V20 chip. Of course I'd like to be able to use it to run CP/M.
I  have tried several software emulators,  but just one using the
V20, giving a mere 52K TPA. They are of several type:
1) stubs to concatenate ahead of a CP/M load module.
2) simulators executing the filename in the parameter line.
3) emulation of a CP/M environment with CCP.
Completeness of the simulation varies.  Some features such as get
allocation vector (function 1B) or BIOS physical disk access  are
virtually impossible to emulate when using MSDOS disks and files.
But  many miss the point that if MSDOS returns code 3 to  a  file
read  (partial  record read,  filled with zeroes),  it should  be
translated to 0. That's why I feel best to own source code.
I  like  to have the complete CP/M environment,  but  solution  1
gives  the best of both worlds if one concatenates the stub to  a
relocating and reloadable CCP.
I  have  read  an  article stating that GFI sells a  V20  type  1
product with source code.  It achieves the tremendous TPA size  I
am  looking  for,   but  the  sample  code  listed  was  not  too
encouraging. Any comment?
Is there anything available in the public domain? I wouldn't mind
spending  some  time  adapting  a CCP to  a  type  1  stub.  Some
additional MSDOS commands such as change path would be useful.
Thanks in advance.

Hi,

a friend of mine is looking for the following:

Source of a BASIC-Interpreter with floating point arithmetics in
8088/Z80 or 80286 assembler

or

floating point arithmetic routines in same assembler languages to be
incorporated into a to be written BASIC interpreter.

Purpose:

He is working on his thesis in chemistry engineering which involves
develop a portable real time data aquisition system (hardware and
software).

That system will run under a BASIC enabling the useres to write the
programs for each run in a high level language.

We are also looking for ISAM routines either in source code or OBJ
files to be run on an IBM-PC/XT/AT, preferably public Domain.


I'd appreciate any pointers to where to get those files if they exist.
I have no ARPA access here in Germany. I can access the ARCHIVE-
REQUEST@SIMTEL20.ARPA by mail if they are already there. Otherwise one
can send the files as UUencoded mail to this account.

thanx in advance,

el

	ZCPR3.3 : some first comments

				Peter Teuben,
				June 2, 1987

This concerns ZCPR3.3, the latest update in the line of 
command processors for CP/M, and my first experiences.

We have all watched ZCPR grow over the past years to a fairly
grown up module of what we now call the Z-system. None of
the original modules from Digital Research are still used,
the CCP being replaced by ZCPR and BDOS replaced by ZRDOS
(often we write our own BIOS's).

ZRDOS can be only be obtained commercially (Echelon), but 
ZCPR(3.3) can in principle be obtained for free (although at
Echelon you have to pay $4x, but I guess they will accompany
my order with a nice installation manual).

However, I was impatient, and got the 100k of initial startup
sources from SIMTEL20. (That's for free, as most BBS's are, I
presume)

For me this kind of installation is just an evening of work,
and very amusing to do so. I installed ZCPR3 last summer in just
an evening, including all modifications to the BIOS (thanks to the 
excellent documentation by Richard Conn).

Last september I witnessed a rough discussion between Richard Conn
and Jay Sage, on their use of the appropriate assembler for the
'Z-Libraries', i.e. ZAS (Echelon) versus Z80ASM (SLR).

I also listened to Richard Conn's story on his building of ZCPR33, 
on last years Trenton Computer Festival (april '86), and now it is 
there!

To my great surprise the author of ZCPR3.3 turened out to be .... 
Jay Sage!

What ever happened to Richard? (are you listening Richard?) Or his code.

But, and this is now perhaps not a big suprise, I completely
failed in installing ZCPR3.3 (I thought it was advertised as having
an even easier installment as with V3.0, which I thought was already
pretty simple), because all of my 'reliable' compilers failed:
ASM, MAC, RMAC, M80, Z80MR. (ASM, MAC, RMAC couldn't help it, the 
new code is now written in Z80 opcode, which I can perhaps
agree with; what will happen to the poor old 8080 users, or did
they all die?)

Apart from a few trivial problems (who EVER came up with the idea
of replacing brackets (yes: ()'s) with square bracket's []????),
the author used a compiler where one needs now at least an 8 character-
length variable name detector. We all now that M80 exports only
6! I phoned SLR, the experts there told me that M80 V3.44 exports
6 yes (because of the .REL format), but can internally use 16
character lenght!!
I tried mine (V3.4 from 1980!!), and even a little test, but no way. 
Does anyone know of that (newer) 3.44 version, and is it true what SLR
told me. Other than that, M80 would probably have done the job (apart 
from two extra needed .PRINTX's and having MACLIB filenames in full and
uppercase). Even compilers with 7 character length variable names
will fail, as a quick glance over the code learned.

The end of the story you can probably guess: I dialed into Jay's
machine last nigh and found an order option for the SLR compiler (and Linker,
but one could live without this one). After reading the description
of the compiler, I'm really impressed. Like 5-10 faster than M80,
and so many more possibilities. It will be quite an improvement for
assembler programming, but I keep thinking of the funny stories I
read in these rebuttals last september.

I am looking forward to receiving my SLR compiler from Jay,
(Btw Jay, I have a Kaypro 4, DS DD)  and
will perhaps let you netreaders know what happened. After all, ZCPR 
is really a fantastic piece of software, and moreover, allows YOU to 
write and modify part of the operating system (&utilities), which is
not possible on many machines for a price like we pay for this

Let me know what your experiences are, do all of you know have these
fancy new compilers, like ZAS and Z80ASM? I am just old fashioned?
Afer all, at some stage we have to make use of the Z80 itself. Of
course if we extrapolate this, soon the Z80 users will find themselves
deserted, because ZCPR4.0 will be written for Z280 or HD64810 only.

Hello, Peter,

	Thanks for your message on ZCPR 3.3.  The basic story is that I'm
not involved with Echelon wrt ZCPR any more, and I've handed over ZCPR 3.x,
TERM3, DISCAT, etc to them so they can continue to support the Z System
users.  Jay sage and others are merrily hacking away at the Z System, building
upon the ideas in my original ZCPR3, mutating it as they desire.
	In the meantime, I'm working on two main thrusts: Ada and a
new ZCPR 4.0 (at least, that's what it is called at this time).  I talked
about both at the last Trenton Computer Festival and can probably make
the ZCPR 4.0 information available if anyone is interested.
	In the Ada arena, I manage the Ada Software Repository on SIMTEL20.
The introduction of Ada technology is also a big part of my main job.
	In the ZCPR 4.0 arena, I'm back in the original environment
that spawned ZCPR 3.0.  There is no time pressure, no delivery dates, and
complete freedom to create.  There is also no requirement to deliver at all,
so I really don't know if what I am working on will materialize in the
user community.  At one point I was working on ZCPR 3.3, moving in the
direction of my current ZCPR 4.0; the effort was quite large, leading to
something larger than the original ZCPR 3.0 and TERM3 combined.  The ZCPR 3.3
that Echelon is supporting is not the original ZCPR 3.3 at all, but a completely
different effort headed by Jay Sage that is a fraction of the original
ZCPR 3.3 effort.  That original ZCPR 3.3 is now the ZCPR 4.0 I'm working
on.
	The bottom line is that the Echelon effort is available to the
users now (i.e., the ZCPR 3.3 of Jay Sage).  Continue to follow it
and enjoy the work of Jay and the others involved.  The work I'm
doing may or may not be released some day, and you can see then if you
want to continue with them, move to mine, do both, or whatever.  To the
user community, this should be a win-win proposition.

		Rick Conn

A few days ago I posted my suprises with ZCPR3.3 and it's required
new assemblers (I guess both ZAS and Z80ASM will do),
I got curious what actually happened to the old assemblers.
To me this is quite
a change with older versions of ZCPR, but we all know, one day the
old 8080 code will be replaced by Z80, and by Z280 and HD64180...

Now, I am curious how many people that read this messages actually do
still use assemblers, and if so, which one.
I only knew of ASM, MAC, RMAC and M80, but know we need either ZAS
or Z80ASM. Also a public domain Z80MR is available, but there maybe
more.
I would appreciate some responses, and will summarize to the net in
a couple of weeks when things slow down.
It seems that I was a rather oldfashioned user, and that most of the
community has changed to the more modern assemblers. Let me know.

There is an excellent PD non-shareware (cheaper: as in free) "make" in the
SIMTEL20 archives that works rather well under CP/M 3.0, so you might
want to keep your price on the low side.  8-)

I have been meaning to send Keith P. my updated version that I've been
using for a while but I seem to have trouble sending things to him &
haven't heard from him since my last two or three mailings (this is a hint
in case you're reading this Keith).  My newer version isn't all that much
better though...the "old" one is perfectly fine.  My dancing fingers like
to do the creeping-feature waltz......

The version I generated (the two above) are ones that I "strongly-ported"
from the version USENET-posted by a gentleman in Australia whose name I
don't recall (his name is in the bit of documentation I wrote up for the
package).  His version was *for* UNIX (of some flavor).

One of the changes I've made is so that when "my" make is used with CCP105
(my update of CCP104), execution of the "make-proceedure" optionally will
terminate upon a step-wise error (RSX's are provided in the CCP105 package
to make you compiler, assembler, linker, etc cooperate).  This was one of
the last "features" that I debugged and got actually working.  I don't
think the "old version" of make will keep the "steps" out of CCP105's
csh-like history mechanism, but my current version does.

Anyway, if your version is for CP/M 2.2 (which my version doesn't work
for), then this surely is a needed "product".  If so, you might mention
what file timestamping mechanism (or equivalent) you require the target
system to have. 

I don't know about the distribution policy on the ARPA side of things,
but I've seen some shareware across the USENET side (most noteably "ARC").

Subject: CONIX v/xs ZCPR

   For about the last year I've been drooling over the ads for CONIX, the
super-duper CP/M replacement. It got good reviews, and looks better than ZCPR3
in many ways. I use ZCPR2 now, but a lot of that stuff is only really useful
for hard drives and multiple users (I run dual 8" DSDD floppies and a RAM
disk). 

  However, there seems to be a lot of fuss and bother over ZCPR3, but not a 
peep about CONIX. How come? Doesn't *anybody* use it? I would really like to 
see some discussion.

  For that matter, has anybody tried out that PD BDOS replacement I read 
about recently (can't remember who by)?

I don't know what is available on SIMTEL20 in this area, but a
publication appeared years ago (part of the "wizard-series") with
a title something like "mysteries of Radio-Shack Microsoft Basic
revealed".  It is a paper copy (dis-assembly??) of the Z80 assembler
for Radio Shack's BASIC.  As I remember it was a f.p. BASIC, although
not awfully fast.
Another possible source is the government clearing house for
technical information (N.T.I.S.) in suburban Wash. D.C.  Seems
to me that they had a BASIC called LLL-BASIC that was developed
at Livermore Lab.  Don't know much about that one either, except
that it exists, it had f.p., and was written in either 8080 or Z80
assembler. 
Good Luck!

last-minute address changes.  It is, therefore, quite possible that a number
of the release-version utilities and auxiliary packages will not work
properly with this version of ZCPR33 (I have not determined for sure whether
or not the last changes got into this version).  Some of the failures will
be quite subtle.  I recommend that if you downloaded any of these files you
destroy them.  If you distributed them further, please try to track them
down and have them removed as well.  It will be very unfortunate if bad
copies end up in wide distribution.  The official release versions are
currently available from many Z-Node remote access systems, including mine
at 617-965-7259 (password=DDT, on entering operating system enter user ID of
"NONE" for 60-minute access).
 
     As soon as I can, I will arrange for the proper distribution files to
be put up on SIMTEL20.  The files have to be converted from squeezed form to
crunched form, and CRC values have to be tabulated.  Since there is more
than 500K of code, this may take a little while.  I will try to get the
material onto SIMTEL20 by June 6.

Subject: Some Comments on ZCPR33 and the 8-Bit World
To: info-cpm@simtel20.arpa

Message-ID: <SAGE.15553418@LL.ARPA>

     Peter Teuben's comments about the ZCPR33 release that appeared today
over the network finally got me to sit down and compose this message.  These
comments are in no way addressed specifically to Peter; his remarks simply
provided the impetus for me to collect these thoughts in writing.  Although
I follow the INFO-CPM exchanges on the DDN, I do not spend much time
contributing to the discussion.  My work with 8-bit computers is almost
entirely a personal-time activity, and I try to avoid spending time at work
on it.  For those of you who do not know, in real life I am an ANALOG device
physicist, always trying to show that only analog devices, and not digital
ones, can solve the world's really pressing signal-processing problems. 
Right now I am working in two areas: analog focal-plane image preprocessors,
chips that use the same devices (CCDs for example) not only to capture an
image but also to figure out what it means (an artificial retina, to put it
in grandiose terms); and artificial analog neural network chips, integrated
circuits that function in a simplified brain-like way to perform
associations and to recognize patterns.
 
     First of all, I hope everyone has seen my message about the files on
SIMTEL20.  In brief, those files were NOT authorized versions.  They were
beta-test versions that were improperly sent to Keith Petersen.  I do not
know for sure, but they may contain code that is not up to date, code that
will malfunction in subtle ways with release versions of system segments and
utility programs.
 
     Second, on the matter of the assembly-language format.  The release
files are in a format that permits assembly with Echelon's ZAS assembler. 
Bear in mind that ZCPR33 is a COPYRIGHTED COMMERCIAL product.  Its release
for personal, noncommercial application at no cost is a privilege, not a
right.  Understand that Echelon is trying to stay in business so that all of
us can continue to benefit from further developments.  Without Echelon, I
think it is quite likely that ZCPR, if not 8-bit computing in general, would
come to an end.  Some of you know that Echelon and I have not always been on
the best of terms.  It is not my love for Echelon but rather our common
purpose in advancing 8-bit computing that has brought us together.
 
     One of the famous sore points between me and Echelon concerns the ZAS
assembler and, among other things, its idiosyncratic use of square brackets
where standard assemblers use ordinary parentheses.  Nevertheless, I
understand that it is not only reasonable but entirely appropriate that
Echelon products, like ZCPR33, be capable of assembly using THEIR assembler. 
I personally use the highly professional assembly-language tools from SLR
Systems and adjust for ZAS compatibility when the development is complete. 
Fortunately, Steve Russell (SLR) was kind enough to make his tools accept
ZAS-format expressions, which greatly facilitates this process.  ZAS, by the
way, is currently undergoing a significant upgrade (by a different
programmer), and I have good reason to believe that my objections to it will
soon be corrected and that it will become an acceptable product that will
function particularly nicely in a Z environment.
 
     With ZCPR33 we made a conscious decision not to be tied to the
limitations of the 1970s-vintage CP/M.  Six-character labels may have been
reasonable in the early days of computing, but that is no longer the case. 
We have worked very hard to make the ZCPR33 source code extremely readable
and educational.  It is carefully organized and heavily commented.  Using
meaningful labels makes the code easier to understand and maintain (if
anything, the labels are probably still too short).  We have also dropped
support for 8080/8085 processors and made free use of highly efficient
Z80-specific opcodes.  This includes not only the commonly used relative
jumps but also word subtraction, direct double-register transfers, block
moves and compares, and the alternate register set.
 
     What about those people with older assembly-language tools or computers
with 8080 or 8085 processors?  The basic answer is that the ZCPR33
COMMERCIAL PRODUCT does not support them.  The market does not justify the
work required to do so.  For users, there are two solutions.  First of all,
I think it is entirely reasonable for someone to spend $69 for ZAS/ZLINK or
$50 for the SLR Z80ASM or SLR180 assembler (plus $50 for SLRNK if they want
a linker, too) so that they can take immediate advantage of the released
code without significant effort on their own part.  If they do not wish to
do so, the source code is there, and they have the alternative of spending
their time to make whatever conversions are required.  The same comment
applies to conversion to work with Intel microprocessors.
 
     Converting the code to work with M80 or ZASM (the copyrighted Cromemco
assembler) is actually rather easy for those who are expert at using those
assemblers.  A number of my beta-testers did it quite regularly (though I
wondered why they were willing to waste their time when they could be using
Z80ASM with its five-times speed advantage).  The files can most likely be
adapted to Z80MR as well, though I don't know of anyone who has done it
already.  Files will undoubtedly appear in due course (from the user
community) that will describe the procedures in detail or even perform them
semi-automatically (using SUBMIT or ZEX scripts).  Some owners of 8085-based
computers may even have the necessary motivation to put in the time to
develop 8080 versions of the code, as Charlie Strom did for ZCPR2.
 
     Installing ZCPR33 on a system that is currently running ZCPR30 is
extremely easy (provided, of course, that you have a suitable assembler). 
No changes in the memory map are required; the ZCPR33 command processor is a
simple drop-in replacement for ZCPR30.  Highly detailed procedures,
including some new techniques that take advantage of existing ZCPR3
facilities, are described in the ZCPR33 User Guide available from Echelon
(while the code has been released for personal, noncommercial use, the
documentation will be available only in printed form).
 
     This brings me to an important general comment.  I have enjoyed working
in the 8-bit world, despite the rip tide sweeping people in the direction of
'DOS' machines, because I like the values and attitudes in the community
much better than those I perceived in the 16-bit world.  Programmers in the
8-bit world freely shared their source code and their ideas so that the
talents of the entire community, and not just those of a single programmer,
could be brought to bear on a given program or problem.  This is good.
 
     But there is a bad side aspect to the attitudes in the 8-bit world. 
Too many have come to assume that they have a RIGHT to receive everything
for free -- both the programs themselves and instruction and help in their
use.  I recently experienced an extreme example of this when one of the
users of my Z-Node kept calling me on voice with questions, for hours at a
time, during the most critical period of ZCPR33 development.  I finally lost
patience with this person when he starting asking for help using Z80ASM,
which I knew he had not paid for but had stolen.  His attitude seemed to be
that because of HIS GREAT INTEREST in 8-bit computing he had a right to ask
for all this free consulting time.
 
     The trouble with this attitude is that without adequate financial
compensation to those programmers who spend exceptional amounts of time
developing programs, there will be fewer and fewer programmers developing
significant new 8-bit programs.  We will then all be complaining that the
trouble with CP/M is that there are no new application programs available! 
If we refuse to spend even modest sums of money to purchase programs and if
we illegally copy them, then to be sure no more will be developed. 
Programmers will turn to the 16-bit world.  As a general rule, the software
products offered by Echelon, SLR Systems, Plu*Perfect Systems, and the few
other remaining producers of CP/M-compatible software (and hardware) are
very reasonably priced.  I stronly encourage people to support them (and
have been doing so since long before I found myself on the other side of the
fence as a member of the Echelon team).
 
     My case is a simple example of this.  Unlike the people at SLR Systems
or Echelon, who devote full time to their activities and have to support
themselves on the income from them, I do programming in my spare time,
largely for the fun and challenge of it.  The development of ZCPR33 from my
experimental ZCPR315, however, took about three and a half months of full-
(spare)time work, typically from middle evening until one or two in the
morning.  Unless that effort realizes some 'spending' money that my whole
family can enjoy, there is no way I will be able to devote that kind of
energy to further developments.  So much for the soap box.
 
     One final comment.  Many further developments are still anticipated,
not only for the 64180 and Z280 processors (the ZOS operating system) but
also for the Z80.  I have actually started work already on ZCPR34 (any
suggestions?).  The RCP package that was released with ZCPR33 is far from
finished (actually, it was very little more than RCP145, the experimental
version that complemented ZCPR315).  If things go well with this first
release, there will be many follow-on developments appearing at a rapid
pace.

Michael, 

I don't want to diminish your efforts, but Jon's make runs on vanilla
CP/M 2.2, which some (many? I don't know) of us are stuck with. I might
like to get going with 3.0, to use some of its advantages but my system
doesn't bankswitch, and I don't know where to even get the 3.0 manuals
(which I would like to have) much less the software.

I run CPM for two or three reasons: it's cheap; it has a history which makes
it interesting; there's a large and public-spirited user community; there's 
lots of PD software around. I guess that's more than 3. Anyway, none of those
things jive very well with the way Z-system appears to be going, if I have to 
buy their assembler to use it. When I can afford to buy it, I don't have time
to use it enough to justify it, and vice versa (huh?). Besides, I've heard that
ZCPR3 chews up too much TPA for what it gives people who don't run hard drives.

 As far as hardware goes, I run and S-100 bus system. Anybody know how I can 
upgrade that to a super-Z80 without spending hundreds of bucks or hundreds of
hours? I know, there are lots of different processors for S100. Did you ever
price one?
 Enough flame, I guess.

I just finished getting zcpr3.3 to assemble with M80 version 3.44 (dated Dec 9,
1981).  The following is a summary of the changes that are needed to get the
CCP portion to assemble (I still haven't recieved the RCP & FCP portions
from SIMTEL so I don't know what changes need to be made to those files).

1. In all files the square brackets "[" & "]" need to be changed to "(" & ")"
   respectively on all conditional assembly statements (ie if's).  DON'T do a
   global change with a text editor since some square brackets don't need to
   be changed!

in the file ZCPR33.Z80:

2. The maclib command must be converted to upper case along with it's arguments

3. The commands .Z80 and ASEG should be added.

in the file Z33HDR.LIB:

4. The extmpath, extmpathadr and whldir equate statements should have the EQU
   changed to a DEFL (this should be changed anyways, I think).

in the file Z33MAC.LIB

5. M80 can only handle 6 chars for a macro argument (even in version 3.44) so
   the 'command' macro needs to be changed.  Following is an updated version:

; Command table entry definition macro

; Macro to form an entry for one command in the table.  The first parameter is
; the name to be used for the command (no quotes); the second parameter is the
; flag that indicates whether or not the command is to be enabled; the third
; parameter is the wheel control flag; and the last parameter is the jump
; address to the code that carries out the command.  The command names are
; automatically padded out to the correct length (they will be truncated and
; an error message will result if a command name is too long).  The characters
; in the command name are automatically converted to upper case.

command	macro cmdnam,enaflg,whlflg,addr

	 if	enaflg		;; Generate command only if enabled

whlmask	defl	whlflg		;; Initialize variables
count	defl	cmdsize		;; Initialize to size of each command name

	irpc	char,cmdnam	;; Repeat over letters in command name

count	defl	count - 1	;; Count down characters in name

	 if	( count lt cmdsize )

		;; If character is lower case, convert to upper case

	 if	( '&char' ge 'a' ) and ( '&char' le 'z' )

	 if	whlmask
	defb	( '&char' and 5fh ) + 80h
	 else	;;not whlmask
	defb	( '&char' and 5fh )
	 endif	;;whlmask

	 else	;;not lower case

	 if	whlmask
	defb	'&char' + 80h	;; If controlled by wheel, set high bit
	 else	;;not whlmask
	defb	'&char'		;; If not restricted, leave high bit clear
	 endif	;;whlmask

	 endif	;;lower case

	 endif	;;( count lt cmdsize )

whlmask	defl	false		;; Turn off high-bit setting after first char

	endm	;irpc

		;; Pad command name with blanks

	 if	( count gt cmdsize )	;; If we underflowed
	*** Command name "&cmdname" is too long / truncated ***
	 else
	rept	count
	defb	' '
	endm
	 endif	;( count gt cmdsize )

	dw	addr		;; Dispatch address for command

	 endif	;enable

	endm	;command


After successful assembly, the resultant .REL file was converted to a HEX file
using RELHEX.COM and then merged with the BIOS in the standard manner.  Even
though M80 only outputs 6 char labels in the REL file, it still keeps larger
labels during assembly, so the use of large labels in zcpr3.3 doesn't affect 
M80 in the least.  Hope this helps in getting people stared with assembling
zcpr3.3 with M80.

A side note: zcpr3.3 came up the first time I tried booting it!  It did take
me 2 hours to figure out all the changes that needed to be made to the
source files for M80, but after that first successful assemble, it booted 
with no problems.
  
Regarding zcpr 4.0, I'd love to hear what you're doing with it Richard, how
about posting a summary of what's going on with it, either that, or send it
directly to me.

Ken,

I don't think anybody on the net is running CONIX. I posted a request for
info a year or so ago.. nothing. I've seen one or two other requests, same
result.

Ditto for the BDOS replacement (it's on my list to do - but way down it).

     It doesn't look better once you put both of them side by side and
compare features.

     You haven't seen any discussion of ConIX for the simple fact that it
isn't worth much.  It adds a whole *bunch* of resident commands, but that's
about it.  It allows I/O re-direction, but it will only work with its own
programs.  ZCPR3 is much better.

>/kenw

     The BDOS replacement you are thinking of ( I think ) is SUPRBDOS.  It
came originally from the Netherlands... then it was known as P2DOS.  Very
nice bit of programming.  Much like ZRDOS... detects changed disks and
re-loggs them, fixes the delete key, increases the max. file size to
8 Gbytes, etc.  Also allows time/date stamping, if you have a clock.
Email me if you want more info...

Ken, I am not even sure CONIX is still trying to sell it.  They released a
big portion as freeware to the public domain almost a year ago due to lack of
response, hoping to generate a set of users who would pay for the full upgrade.
These files are located on Blaise Pascal System (NY) at (718) 604-1930.  I
do not know if they are still there.

I never fully implemented the CONIX stuff. After a brief experimental period,
I abandoned the project.  It seems very usable, but suffers the same memory
constraints and disk problems as ZCPR.  Considering ZCPR is well supported, a
choice between the two would favor ZCPR.  However, I am a developer (in my all
too short spare time) who can't afford a smaller TPA.  So, I remained with my
current OS: QP/M with Qplus extensions.

Check out the NY board for the files and good luck.

	Since no one else has mentioned it, I'd like to point out
that ZCPR and CONIX can be used *together*; they get along fine
on my system. I run ZCPR2 on an Apple - CP/M system with Sider
hard disk (never managed to get ZCPR3.X to work - Softcard CP/M
is strange, and I'm no expert in the Z80 world), and have the PD
CONIX stuff from SIMTEL. It needs no installation in the system,
it's just run like an application, and it gets along just dandy
with ZCPR2.
	I like both enhancements, but generally don't bother
running CONIX since: 1) ZCPR eliminates all the worst limitations of
vanilla CP/M; 2) CONIX has many, many features, and somewhat
cryptic commands, making it less valuable for my occasional use -
I can never remember the commands :-(; I'm mainly using a
68000 system these days (Amiga), and thus forgetting what little
I did know of CP/M.
	Nonetheless, CONIX seems, from my occasional use, to be a
good product, especially since it can be run when needed, and
removed when in the way, without altering one's system software,
or needing to choose between it and the Z-system. If it's as
compatable with ZCPR3.0 and 3.3 as it is with ZCPR2, the choice
is obvious: get both.

The following official release files of ZCPR 3.3 are now available on
SIMTEL20:

Filename			Type	 Bytes	 CRC

Directory PD:<CPM.ZCPR33>
SHOW11.LBR.1			BINARY	 41600  447BH
Z33ERR07.LBR.2			BINARY	 10880  D711H
Z33FCP10.LBR.3			BINARY	 41600  92BDH
Z33RCP01.LBR.1			BINARY	 49280  C06CH
ZCPR33.LBR.3			BINARY	 83968  F32CH

ZCPR33.LBR is the command processor.

Z33FCP10.LBR is version 1.0 of the new flow command package -- fairly
mature.

Z33RCP01.LBR is version 0.1 of the new resident command package -- not
very mature, hence the low version number.

SHOW11.LBR displays information about one's operating system
configuration.  This version has greatly improved displays of the
information included in the earlier version plus much new information
about ZCPR33 features.

Z33ERR07.LBR is an early version of an advanced error handler that
reports to the user what caused the error (in Z30 there was basically
only one kind of error -- command not found).  Z33 traps many other
kinds of errors, such as invalid numerical format, illegal directory,
bad password, etc.

Subject: 'make' utilities for cp/m 2.2
Date: Sat, 06 Jun 87 13:50:25 PDT

Another unix-style 'make' can be found on the DateStamper Toolkit
disk.   It was developed by Neal Maron for DateStamper-equipped systems
from a public-domain MSDOS version .

DateStamper runs on 8080 and z80 cp/m 2.2 systems and several
emulators - including zrdos and some apple systems.  It supports
automatic file date and time-stamping.  (If no real-time clock is
available, the 'time' is a sequential number on the given date.)

DateStamper and the toolkit are available from Plu*Perfect Systems.

Subject: Z-80 assembly UUDECODE is (sort of) done.

I just (moments ago) finished the Z-80 assembly version of
UUDECODE.  Thanks to all those who sent me mail, I was unable to
reply due to problems finding paths back to you.  A few questions
still remain however:
 
1)	What on earth is the 'mode' number?  That's the number that shows
	up between "begin" and the filename on the header line of a
	UUENCODEd file.  I'm just ignoring it, is that safe?
 
2)	The Eunichs online 'manual' claims that "the body is terminated
	by a line with a count of zero.  This line consists of one
	ASCII space."  However, the UUENCODE I got from SIMTEL20 does
	not conform to this, but rather sticks a "`" (60H) into the file,
	which being an out of band character, I guess is supposed to
	signal something.  Which is right?  I'm currently calling it an
	error and closing the file properly (which works), but this makes
	me nervous....
 
3)	The online 'manual' says that each line can be up to 62 characters
	long, including the trailing newline.  What is meant by 'newline'?
	Is it CR, or LF, or both, or what?
 
4)	Is there a real honest-to-gloz protocol definition out there
	somewhere that someone could send me?  Please don't tell me
	to RTFM, the nearest Eunichs machine is miles away, and I can
	only talk to it thru our network.
 
5)	I find that my program tends to stick on a final sector full of
	NULL bytes.  This causes strange things to happen with CRC
	checking.  How can I get the total byte count of the output
	file by looking at the UUENCODEd file?  I suspect that this
	may go away when I figure out what the 'right' way of terminating
	the file is.
 
Teaser:	Once I get all this info together, I can write the encoder and 
	submit them both to SIMTEL20.  The decoder seems to run
	about 7 times as fast as the PASCAL version that's floating
	around [your milage may vary, I have a hard disk cache...].
	The size of the decoder executable is 3.125 K bytes, less than
	one third the size of the PASCAL version.  Anyone want to be a
	Beta test site?

Subject: New CP/M files uploaded to SIMTEL20 during April and May

The following is a complete list of CP/M-oriented files uploaded to
SIMTEL20 during the months of April and May, 1987.  The numbers
following the filenames are the file size in bytes followed by the
file format.  (7) means ASCII, (8) means binary.

For a complete list of all CP/M files, see:
   PD:<CPM>CPM.CRCLST - Complete list with CRC values
   PD:<CPM>FILES.DIR  - Abbreviated list with only directory and file names
   PD:<CPM>FILES.IDX  - Similar to below, no descriptions, comma delimited

There is currently no complete listing of all files with descriptions.
That is in the process of being created and will be announced when
available.  In the meantime, see PD:<CPM.FILE-DOCS>GENIECPM.MZY which
is a complete listing of all CP/M, files on GEnie, each with a
one-line description.  Since SIMTEL20 and GEnie have many of the same
files, this will be a very useful listing.  It is updated monthly.

Note: to save space in the following listing, the device name PD: which
normally appears ahead of the directory name has been omitted.

This user apparently thinks that he has a right to expect all of US to put

possible for him to use his antiquated assembler to take free advantage of
our code.  If we don't, then we 'commercial users' are ruining things for
'us hobbyists.'  Just as an aside, I wonder if he ever PAID for that M80
assembler -- it was not public domain after all, but many people just stole
copies.  If I remember correctly it cost well over $100 back in the days
when a dollar was worth a lot more than it is today.  As I said in my
earlier message, I don't think that $50 (maybe $25 in M80-era dollars?) for
a super assembler is much to expect someone to spend to gain access to the
fruits of our work.  Though I, too, do computing as a hobby, I certainly
would not dream of wasting my limited hobby time using, today, an assembler
like M80, when I can have a good one for between $50 and $100.  If someone
really cannot afford that amount, then let them contribute the time to
convert the code.  So long as the source code is there, I don't see how
anyone can justify a claim that things are being ruined for hobbyists.

Funny, I was about to ask a similar question.  This past week I received Z-COM
from Echelon and found that it just doesn't work correctly with my Zenith Z-89
with the Magnolia version of CPM so I have to return it to Echelon.  Anyway for
about the past 3 months I've played on and off with the shareware version of
Conix and found it does just about everything I would buy Z-COM for except
aliases and named directories.  I've notice from CHI's ad that their
programming system or library adds some of this capability. Has anyone used it
and if so how well does it work?  BTW, I'd love to know whether anyone has
bought CONIX and what do they think.  Is it worth buying? 
    As far as speed, it depends on what level of memory management you have. 
I suggest you give the shareware version a try to see whether it meets your 
needs.

An earlier poster mentioned that SUPRBDOS is a (later?) version of P2DOS.
Can anyone comment on this? Is anyone using any of these BDOS replacements?
Has anyone actually installed any of them?

I would like to hear any comments about them. I've had a copy of P2DOS for a
little while now, but it's been low on my list of priorities, so I haven't
dealt with it yet (especially because of the sketchy documentation that came
with it).

     (like we know of CP/M  - programmers guide

UNARCK16.ARK is a self-extracting archive.  It must be renamed to
UNARC16.COM and executed to extract the files within.

Below is a message from Bob Freed, the author.

File:     UNARC.MSG
Subject:  Release Message for UNARC Program
Version:  1.6
Date:     March 27, 1987
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 1.6 of the CP/M UNARC utility:

* Corrects a bug in version 1.5, which caused generation of an 'incorrect CRC'
  warning message (during extraction of files to disk) in certain cases where
  such an error condition did not actually exist.

Version 1.5 of UNARC included the following changes from the previous version
1.4 release:

* Provides self-unpacking archive support (see below).
* Corrects a serious bug in the non-Z80 version (UNARCA.COM), which caused
  failure to output the last 1-255 bytes of an extracted file in certain
  situations.  (In particular, ALL files less than 256 bytes in length could
  not be extracted from archives.)
* Supports the new "squashed" compression method generated by the MS-DOS
  program PKARC (version 2.0 or later).
* Provides a new command line option (P) for direct printing of files on the
  CP/M list device.
* Provides a new command line option (C) for checking the validity of archive
  files.
* Displays a checksum total of CRC values (useful for comparing separate
  copies of an archive file).
* Alters the mechanism used to avoid a problem with the LUX library/archive
  utility program, to provide independence of UNARC from recent multiple
  releases of new LUX versions by different authors.  (See USELUX definition
  in UNARCOVL.ASM overlay file.)
* Minor enhancements to tab expansion and CTRL-S/CTRL-C processing during
  file typeout.
* Expands on-line help display examples.

Complete details of all of the above changes (and past history of prior UNARC
releases) are provided in the version 1.5 source program file (UNARC.Z80).

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

UNARC is now distributed exclusively as a "self-unpacking" archive file,
UNARC16.ARK.  This allows automatic extraction of the distributed files,
without requiring access to a separate copy of UNARC.COM or UNARCA.COM.  To
utilize this capability, simply copy or rename UNARC16.ARK to a program file,
UNARC16.COM, on the current disk drive.  (The exact file name UNARC16.COM is
required.)  Then, run this program, with a single optional command line
parameter specifying the disk drive to which all distribution files will be
extracted (defaults to current disk).

For example, assuming UNARC16.ARK is on drive B:, and the files are to be
extracted to drive C:, the following CP/M commands may be used:

   A>B:                            ; Set current drive for UNARC16.ARK
   B>REN UNARC16.COM=UNARC16.ARK   ; Rename it to UNARC16.COM
   B>UNARC16 C:                    ; Run it to extract all files to drive C:

Note that this self-unpacking capability is provided only by the distributed
archive file, and it will not work if that file is altered or reconstructed.

Items 1-7 are included in the self-unpacking UNARC16.ARK file.  Item 5 may be
used to supply a requested program description after uploading UNARC16.ARK to
a remote system.  Item 6 supports all user-configurable program options.

Item 8 is distributed in a separate archive file, UNARC15S.ARK, and it is not
required for UNARC program operation or configuration.  (Due to the relatively
insubstantial nature of the version 1.6 update, the new source code file is
not being distributed.  However, item 7 may be used, in conjunction with the
SSED utility (version 2.0, by Chuck Forsberg), to generate an updated source
code file from the distributed file for version 1.5.)

				     NOTE

	8080/8085 USERS:  The file UNARCA.COM is an alternate version
	of the program which will run on your systems.  However, it is
	larger and substantially slower than the standard (Z80-only)
	version, UNARC.COM.  (UNARCA.COM will run on ALL CP/M systems,
	but it is specifically NOT recommended for users with Z80's!)

	RCP/M SYSOPS:  The assembly language overlay file UNARCOVL.ASM
	is provided primarily for your use in generating a secure
	version of UNARC for use by remote callers.  Note that several
	of the UNARC 1.6 changes had been distributed to RCP/M Sysops
	in an earlier Beta-test release (UNARC 1.42).  That version
	was also distributed with several recent releases of the LUX
	utility program (by different authors), and it should now be
	replaced by UNARC 1.6.  (If you use LUX, be sure to define
	USELUX = YES in the overlay file.)  Due to the self-unpacking
	feature of UNARC16.ARK, it is no longer necessary to provide
	separate copies of UNARC.COM and UNARCA.COM for downloading by
	first-time users.  (Even if you prefer the use of .LBR files
	on your system, you are encouraged to maintain at least this
	one file, UNARC16.ARK, in its distributed form!)

The UNARC.DOC file provides a complete program description and user operating
instructions.  Refer to the notice in that file regarding rights of use and
distribution of this program and its associated documentation files.

The ZEDUX Z280 Accelerator
by Rick Charnes, 7 June 1987, San Francisco

     What's going on here?  A generic Z280 add-on card for CP/M 
computers?  An operating system, assembler and linker already 
available for it?

     I have in front of me a copy of a document dated January 17, 
1987 produced by a company by the name of Zedux, Inc. at 14402 
Hamlin Ave. #C, Van Nuys, CA 91401, phone 818/787-0113 about the 
above.  It was given to me by a gentleman at our BAMDUA general 
meeting last night at which Peter Mireau of MicroPro spoke.  I am 
reading and I am amazed by what I see.  This company has 
apparently produced a generic Z280 board called the Accel 280 and 
has developed not only a genuinely multitasking OS to go along 
with it, but an assembler and linker as well.  This is the first 
I have heard of this.  Can this be for real?  The OS, called RP 
for Remote Partition, sounds like it culls from the best of Z-
System: multiple command lines, aliases, pathing, named 
directories, memory-resident flow control (including 
REPEAT/UNTIL, WHILE/ENDWHILE, BREAK, GOTO/LABEL).  There are 
string/shell variables and expression analysis operating on both 
numbers and strings.   

     The document describes RP as being able to run any number of 
CP/M 2.2 "partitions" simultaneously.  Each program "sees" a 
standard CP/M 2.2 environment, with full BDOS and BIOS access.  
Programs can use almost the entire 64k space without having to 
share this with the operating system.  There is a task console 
handler that allows the user to control and monitor the operation 
of multiple tasks.  Multiple terminals can be connected to the 
same computer and a different task run on each, with privileges 
given to each task.  

     The way the multi-tasking is done is interesting.  If you 
wish each command on your multiple command line to run 
subsequently one after another as we are used to, separate your 
commands with the familiar semicolon.  If you want them to run 
concurrently, separate them with a "&".

     Multitasking has two modes.  One is referred to in the 
document as "Unix style," in which each task's output mixes in to 
the console display.  In the other mode, apparently when a task 
other than the one being worked on finishes an output line, it is 
made to scroll upwards.  You can swap tasks with a "rotate" key 
which flips through the tasks currently executing.

     The doc also describes the Z280 single-pass assembler, AS, 
and linker, LN.

     What is going on here?  Has this been happening beneath our 
noses with none of us knowing about it?  The product is 
apparently available at this time for $350, with 256k DRAM.  I am 
unsure as to why it is being supplied with only 256k RAM since we 
were all expecting a full meg.  I assume this will be expandable 
at some point.  A full package can be had for $600 which includes 
the basic hardware card, an "RP-CP/M compatible" software monitor 
program to talk to the chip (separately $200; I guess only 
necessary for development work), a extension cable if you lack 
sufficient space inside your computer for the board, and the 
assembler and linker (separately $150). 

     A PC-Pursuit-accessible BBS line to Zedux is said to be 
available at (818) 787-0458 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, but I 
just tried it (Sunday afternoon 6/7/87) and there was no answer.

     From everything I can gather after having scanned the 
article with a cynical eye it seems like this product is up and 
running, ready to roll.  It does not sound like vaporware: a 
sentence from the document reads, "The Zedux Accel 280 is 
available at this time."  The person who gave me the document 
says Zilog referred him to the company.  As far as I know Zedux 
has not contacted Echelon, user groups, or any of the traditional 
CP/M/Z-System institutions or sources.  I have no idea if they 
are coordinating work with High Tech Research with the latter's 
UltraBoard or Echelon with their planned ZOS.  I am aware of no 
advertising.  Are they simply too busy to advertise?  Is anyone 
using it?  Does anyone know anything about this product?

Reply to Rob Healey -- posted to the net for general interest
 
                                                June 9, 1987
 
   I do not personally know of anyone running ZCPR on the Tandy 4, but that
does not mean it has not been done.  Is my recollection right that the Tandy
versions of CP/M are peculiar in that they use a base address of 4000H
instead of 100H?  If that is the case, it is much trickier to get the code
right.  I can try to leave a message on Z-Node Central and see if any user
responds.  Unfortunately, I will be leaving shortly on a month's trip, so I
may not be around to receive the answer.
 
   I would expect ZCPR1 to work on just about any system with a Z80
processor, since it is a direct code replacement.  No other changes to the
system are required.  ZCPR3 is another story completely.  The BIOS has to be
moved down to make room for the buffer modules, and the coldboot code has to
be modified to initialize them.  If Montezuma CP/M makes it DIFFICULT to
drop in a new command processor, it probably makes it IMPOSSIBLE to change
the BIOS.
 
 
                                                June 10, 1987
 
   We had our Boston Computer Society meeting last night, and one of the
area Tandy experts was in attendance.  From what he told me, Montezuma CP/M
is a standard implementation that runs programs at 100H.  It was the earlier
Tandy machines that had the peculiar loading address I described above.
 
   In the ZCPR33 Users Guide I describe a technique for installing ZCPR33
without using SYSGEN but using a disk utility program instead.  The
technique in the exact form I described there won't work in your case, but
it can be adapted.  The basic idea is to create a file with an image of the
operating system component you want to install (for example, ZCPR.COM,
ZCPR33.COM, or ZRDOS.BIN).  You then go in with a late-model disk utility
program that supports a queue.  You go to the file containing the image and
suck it up into the queue.  Then you go to the sector on the system track
where that operating system component is stored and flush the queue out on
top of it.  You should be able to use that technique to get ZCPR1 running on
your system.  The only time it will fail, I think, is when the system tracks
and data tracks on the disk use a different format (that is the case on my
BigBoard I with double-density upgrade -- the first system track is always
single density).
 
   Getting ZCPR3 running still requires moving the system down to make room
for the buffers.  Unfortunately, the person I got my information from could
not remember whether there was a full MOVCPM program included with the
Montezuma CP/M.  One's hopes are often falsely raised by seeing MOVCPM.COM
on the disk.  The manufacturer is supposed to install a relocatable version
of HIS BIOS into that utility, but many manufacturers ship the utility as it
comes from Digital Research -- with the Intel MDS-800 BIOS in it!!!!  If you
are lucky and have a real MOVCPM, you should be able to get Z3 working
without inordinate effort.  The change to the coldboot code can be handled
by patching.  If you get that far, I would be glad to provide further
instructions at that time.  Also, even if the BIOS cannot be moved, things
are not hopeless.  There are tricks that can overcome even that, but they
are even more elaborate (I had to do that with my Wave-Mate Bullet -- they
provided neither MOVCPM nor BIOS source).  Again, if you are up to it, I
would be happy to provide more detailed information.

Just chatted with one of the folks at Zedux. The BBS is expected to be
up by this weekend. He is still preparing docs for callers, the usual
housekeeping stuff. The BBS will use the Z280 in an old Cromemco
S-100 Z80 system.  The Z280 is a "co-processor" not too unlike the way
the various ad-on clock cards do, with the Z280 plugging into the Z80
socket, and the Z80 plugging back into the Zedux card. All parts are
soldered in, no sockets. The design will accept 1 megabit Drams when
available, however. Cost was a factor.  He says they did talk to
Echelon, but the software provided is their own, no plans to work
with Echelon. The Z280 will have a 20mHz clock (10 mHz system clock)
and talks to the Z80 via an 8 bit port, the Z80 beibg an I/O
controller in this application. He did talk to Ampro, too, but Ampro
will supposedly come out with their own single board Z280 card, and
Zedux says they will be doing likewise.  I am having some literature
mailed to see what else he may have in print.  No sources for the
system software are offered, not unlike CP/M CCP/BDOS.  It uses host
BIOS...Multiple programs see 64k, minus 512 bytes for system vectors
(page 0, Bdos/bios).

That's about all I got...If you call the service, the Zedux folks will
apparently call back...

WASHINGTON - The Federal Communications Commission proposed a fee
that would steeply increase telecommunications charges for many
business and residential computer users.

Under the FCC proposal, companies such as US Sprint
Communications Co.'s Telenet subsidiary and McDonnell Douglas
Corp.'s Tymnet unit would be charged as much as $5 per hour per
user to hook up their communication networks to local telephone
loops.	Currently, computer networks are exempt from these so-
called access charges.	The charges would almost certainly be
passed on to consumers and business customers.

US Sprint is a joint  venture of GTE Corp. of Stamford, Conn. and
United Telecommunications Inc., Kansas City, Mo.

Price increases would be a big blow for millions of personal-
computer hobbyists who depend on computer networks to communicate
cheaply with one another and to call up such information services
as H&R Block Inc.'s Compuserve Inc.  Currently, most customers
pay only a few dollars an hour in telephone costs.

The proposal also would be a major setback for Telenet and
Tymnet, which have attracted consumers and business customers
with discount computer telecommunications rates.  These
companies rent private telephone lines, which previously haven't
been subject to access charges, and spread the costs among
thousands of computer users.

Rate increases "will dry up the marketplace for new and
innovative computer services" said Joseph Markowski, counsel for
Adapso, a trade association of computer service companies.
"Prices will go through the roof."

He added that the proposal would improperly discriminate between
computer-network companies and other companies that maintain
their own data networks.  The latter companies apparently
wouldn't be charged access fees under the FCC proposal.  Clark
Woodford, a Compuserve executive vice president, said any access
charges "will cause us to reassess our pricing structure."

The FCC voted 4-0 to seek comment on a plan to end the access-
charge exemption by Jan 1, 1988.  The commissioners said the
exemption amounted to a subsidy for the computer-network
companies that was being paid by business and residential
telephone users.  "We don't want the (telecommunications) network
to evolve in response to various subsidies and
anomalities [sic]," said FCC Chairman Dennis Patrick.

Agency staffers and others said the Jan 1 date wasn't firm.  Page
Montgomery, vice president of Economics and Technology, Inc. a
Boston telecommunications company, urged the agency to delay the
decision for perhaps a year until the local phone companies
change their networks to give competitors equal connections.

Otherwise, the regional Bell companies, which are trying to enter
the computerized-communications field, would have a big
advantage.  That's because the computer-service companies would
be burdened with price increases and also wouldn't be able to
offer hook-ups to the local telephone network that are as good as
those offered by the phone companies.  "It would be a serious
policy mistake" to end the exemption Jan. 1, 1988, Mr. Montgomery
said.

The FCC said that access charges should decline over the next few
years, by about a dollar per hour, as the agency increases
residential charges for connecting to the telephone network.
Much of the revenue from these assessments is used to reduce the
access charges paid by telecommunications companies.

The FCC proposal came as a surprise.  In March, the agency
decided that computer-network companies should remain
deregulated, which industry observers interpreted to mean that
rates wouldn't increase.  But now the FCC said that only purely
private networks, operated by some big companies for their
internal communications, would remain free of access charges.

PHONE-ACCESS FEE IS PROPOSED FOR COMPUTERS: FCC WOULD MAKE FIRMS
PAY TO LINK NETWORKS TO LOCAL PHONE LOOPS

		By Bob Davis, Staff Reporter of the WSJ


WASHINGTON - The Federal Communications Commission proposed a fee
that would steeply increase telecommunications charges for many
business and residential computer users.

In Missouri Southwestern Bell has had a 175% of the cost of a flat rate
business line surcharge in effect for 10 years for dial up lines terminating
in a computer.

We (the Army) challenged this in 1977 through the legal troops. What had
really frosted us was that we had 24 dial-up lines terminating in 3 muxes
riding an AT&T 209A modem and link to the Wright-Patterson TIP. We paid!
It seems the very simple way the tariff was written made anything in
Missouri that is directly connected/attached to a computer port gets
charged. We have 52 dial in modems and the cost per month isn't cheap.

What isn't clear is whether both ends of connection are billed $5 per
hour per session or $5 an hour per line regardless of use? How will
they differentiate between data and voice as a lot of companies use
them alternatively for voice during the day and for data during the
low rate periods at night. Take a major programming change for the ESSs
to track incoming calls not to mention the billing programs. Some of the
older switches are pretty dumb and couldn't even do that.

I wonder if the pork barrellers (congress) has EMAIL?

Subject: Myths about ZCPR3
To: info-cpm@simtel20.arpa 
Message-ID: <SAGE.16348225@LL.ARPA>

     I am always sorry to see certain myths perpetrated about ZCPR3,
especially the ones that say ZCPR3 is good only on hard-disk systems and
that it uses up too much TPA.  Different people have different personal
styles in computing, and some will like the way ZCPR works and what it
offers while others will not.  But the choice should be made on sound facts
and sound reasoning.
 
     It is only in the last year that I have had any personal 8-bit computer
system with a hard disk (I still do most of my work on a BigBoard I and
SB180 with only floppy drives), and I have always used ZCPR (1, 2, and 3) to
what I felt was great advantage.  It is certainly true that ZCPR3 runs much
better on the hard-disk and RAM-disk systems, but what doesn't?  ZCPR3,
because of its various forms of extended processing (path searching,
extended command processing, and error handling) does tend to be more disk
intensive.  In one of my columns in The Computer Journal I described
techniques that can be used to significantly speed up these features with
floppy systems to the point that they approach hard-disk performance levels.
 
     As for the reduction of TPA, it is quite true that a full-blown ZCPR3
implementation uses up a lot of TPA -- between 4K and 6K.  In the kind of
work I do (wordprocessing, assembly language programming, and operation of a
remote access computer system), TPA is not a problem, and I have even opted
to use larger than standard RCP, FCP, and NDR modules for the conveniences
they offer.  I understand that people who use C compilers often have
problems getting enough TPA space (sounds as though someone should write a
good virtual-memory C compiler like the SLR Systems virtual assemblers).
 
     Although a full-blown ZCPR3 system uses lots of memory, it is not a
fair comparison to contrast CP/M -- with virtually none of the features --
only with ZCPR3 in its largest configuration.  One can make a ZCPR3 system
that costs only 0.75K bytes of TPA that offers:
 
	automatic command search path (dynamically changeable)
	multiple commands on a line (200+ characters)
	aliases (infinitely nestable and recursive with extensive
		parameter expansion capability)
	extended command processing (highly efficient and powerful
		ARUNZ alias generation)
	nested shells (including command line history with recall,
		searching, and editing)
	error handling (with command line editing)
	terminal-independent operation (UNIX-like TCAP)
 
Thus, as with so many things in this world, more than 80% of the features
come with less than 20% of the cost.
 
     The components in ZCPR3 that cost big memory are the ones that can most
easily be omitted: the named directory register (NDR, 0.25K per 14 names),
the flow command package (FCP, typically 0.5K), the resident command package
(RCP, typically 2K), and the input/output package (IOP, typically 1.5K).  I
have had little use for an IOP and do not have it in use on any of my
systems (though many people like the I/O redirection and keyboard macro IOPs
that are available from Echelon).  With my larger-than-usual NDR (35 names),
FCP (0.625K), and RCP (2.25K), I sacrifice a total of 4.25K of TPA.  When I
use my database manager, the only program I use that does make heavy demands
on TPA, I will just boot up the small ZCPR system.  I can afford the cost of
0.75K.  In ZCPR version 3.3, by the way, the NDR, FCP, and RCP modules can
be configured dynamically, making it even easier to change the system
configuration.
 
     I hope that some people will look more carefully before they dismiss
ZCPR3 as too big or too slow or too hard to use.  It might not be the thing
for you, but then again it might.

To: info-cpm@simtel20.arpa 
Message-ID: <SAGE.16348268@LL.ARPA>

     I have attached a copy of my ZCPR33 application note on the use of the
ARUNZ extended command processor to illustrate what a ZCPR33 system, even
one that uses only 0.75K of TPA, can do.  The examples in it apply to remote
access system applications, but there are a great many uses for aliases on a
personal system as well.  For my assembly language work, for example, I have
alias scripts like the following (they do make use of FCP flow commands):
 
   LINK=LNK slrnk+ /v,$1/n,$1/m,/a:100,/j,$1,a:z33slr/s,a:vslr/s,
	    a:z3slr/s,a:sysslr/s,/e
   AL       slr180+ $1.z80/gr,,nul;if ~error;/lnk $1;fi
   EAL      edit $1.z80;if input assemble and link?;/al $1;fi
   WORK     xif;/eal;if input continue?;work $1;fi
 
If I want to link PROGRAM.REL with the standard Z-System libraries, all I
have to enter is "LNK PROGRAM".  The AL script first assembles the specified
program ($1) and then links it using a nested alias invocation.  Flow
control is used to perform the linkage only if the assembly was successful. 
EAL, which adds editing to the alias, involves doubly nested aliases and a
further use for flow control.  Finally, WORK is recursive.  "WORK PROGRAM"
takes one through any number of edit-assemble-link cycles until one answers
the prompt to continue with a negative response.  There is actually a much
more elegant and rigorous way to implement recursive aliasing, but it is too
involved to describe here.  Once the proper aliases are included in
ALIAS.CMD, it is as easy as "RECURSE EAL PROGNAME" to invoke.  It is
described in my most recent column in The Computer Journal.

                        ZCPR33 APPLICATION NOTES
 
Note Number:	002
Author:		Jay Sage
Date:		June 8, 1987
 
 
     Making Effective Use of ARUNZ as an Extended Command Processor
                 (Especially on a Remote Access System)
 
 
   From my recent experience using several ZCPR33 remote access systems,
most sysops are not aware of the way ARUNZ can be used as an extended
command processor to make the operation of their system much, much
easier for their users.  Because a single 4K ALIAS.CMD file can contain
hundreds of aliases, the cost in disk space to provide a highly error-
tolerant environment to the user is very small.  These techniques can
also be used to great advantage on a personal system to make the sytem
highly tolerant of errors.
 
     The kinds of aliases can be grouped loosely into three categories,
each of which I will cover below.  At the end I will describe a method
for making these aliases execute at top speed.
 
 
Alternate Command Forms
-----------------------
 
     The most obvious use of aliases is to provide alternative names for
commands.  We will use an example to illustrate the principle.  Consider
the task of finding out if a certain file is somewhere on the system and
where.  Some systems use FINDF, the original ZCPR3 program for this
purpose; others use one of the standard CP/M programs (WIS or WHEREIS);
and others have begun to use the new, enhanced ZSIG program called FF. 
This can be very confusing to new users or to users who call many
different systems.  The solution is to provide aliases for all the
alternatives.  Suppose FF is the real program in use.  Then the
following line in ALIAS.CMD will allow all the forms to be used equally:
 
	FINDF=WIS=WHEREIS ff $*
 
(I am following a convention of writing the alias names in upper case
and the script in lower case.  This is only for ease in reading; ARUNZ
is not case sensitive.)  In fact, while I am at it, I usually throw in a
few other forms that someone might try and that are sufficiently
unambiguous that one can guess with some confidence that this is the
function the user intended:
 
	FIND.FILE=FILE.FIND=WIS=WHERE.IS ff $*
 
     Since (for ARUNZ version 0.9D and later) the characters after a
period are optional-match characters (they must match only if characters
are present), the first name will match FIND, FINDF, and FINDFILE (and
others).  The last form will match both WHERE and WHEREIS (and others). 
Note that this single alias, which occupies 40 bytes in ALIAS.CMD
(including the CRLF), responds to 8 commonly used commands for finding
files on a system.  Thus the cost is a mere 5 bytes per command!!
 
     ZCPR33 introduced the ability to bypass path searching and go
straight to the extended command processor by prefixing a command with a
space or slash.  As users begin to avail themselves of this feature to
speed up command processing, it may happen that someone will enter the
command as "/FF" or " FF", thinking that "FF" is an alias for the real
command.  With the script above this will fail.  Therefore, I am now
recommending including the real command as an alias for itself to cover
this situation.  The final form for our file-finding alias (with an
extra change thrown in to allow the short form "WH") is thus:
 
	FIND.FILE=FILE.FIND=WIS=WH.EREIS=FF ff $*
 
     I have extended the use of command aliasing even to include the
results of common typing mistakes.  Richard Jacobson (Mr. Lillipute),
who calls my system quite often, either has a Wyse keyboard with very
bad bounce (as he claims) or is a lousy typist (and refuses to admit
it).  When he wants to display a directory, his command is more likely
to come out DDIR or DIRR than it is to come out correctly as DIR.  So I
added those two forms to my alias, so it now reads:
 
	XD.IR=DDIR=DIR.R dir $*
 
Is seven extra bytes too much to sacrifice for a friend!
 
 
Alternate Directory Changing References
---------------------------------------
 
     It is obviously very hard for users to remember the DU forms for
directories on a remote system, and that is why named directories are
provided.  But even names are not always easy to remember precisely. 
Aliases can help by providing alternative names for logging into
directories, provided ZCPR33 has been assembled with the BADDUECP option
enabled so that invalid directory-change references are passed on to the
extended command processor.  My system has a directory called Z3SHELLS
(I think).  Since even I have trouble remembering that it is not Z3SHELL
or SHELLS or SHELL, I would have a line in ALIAS.CMD that reads:
 
	Z3SHELL:=SHELL:=SHELLS: z3shells:
 
     A further problem is that users often (and I occasionally) forget
to type the colon on the end.  It is very easy for ARUNZ to pick this up
as well and add the colon for you.  Just include the following alias:
 
	Z3SHELL=Z3SHELLS=SHELL=SHELLS z3shells:
 
All of these aliases can be combined into the single script:
 
	Z3SHELL.:=Z3SHELL.S:=SHELL.:=SHELL.S: z3shells:
 
All seven forms are covered by an entry of 49 bytes, a cost of 7 bytes
each.
 
     On my system I provide a complete set of aliases for all possible
directories so that any legal directory can be entered with or without
colons and using either the DIR or the DU form.  Thus, if Z3SHELLS is
B4, the script above would be:
 
	Z3SHELL.:=Z3SHELL.S:=SHELL.:=SHELL.S:=B4.: z3shells:
 
     Before ZCPR33 came along and provided this service itself, I would
allow callers to use the DU form to log into directories beyond the max-
drive/max-user limits by including aliases of the above form.  If the
maximum user area were 3 in the above example, the commands "B4:" and
"B4" would still have worked (even under ZCPR30) because ARUNZ mapped
them into a DIR form of reference.  Although this is no longer
necessary, a complete alias line like the one above covers all bases. 
The user can even enter any of the commands with a leading space or
slash and they will still work.
 
     Finally, I usually provide a catch-all directory change alias to
pick up directory change commands that don't even come close to
something legal.  At the end of ALIAS.CMD (i.e., after all the other
directory-change aliases described above, so that they get first shot) I
include the line"
 
	?:=??:=???:=????:=?????:=??????:=???????:=????????: echo
	  d%>irectory %<$0%> is not an allowed directory.  %<t%>he^m^j
	  valid directories are:;pwd
 
Thus when the user enters the command "BADDIR:", he get the PWD display
of the system's directories prefixed by the message
 
	Directory BADDIR: is not an allowed directory.  The
	valid directories are:
 
Note the use of Z33RCP's advanced ECHO command with case shifting ('%<
to switch to upper case and '%>' to switch to lower case) and control
character inclusion (caret followed by the character).
 
 
Abbreviated Commands
--------------------
 
     This category is closely releated to the first category described
above.  Consider transferring files.  One commonly enters a command like
 
	KMD SK FN.FT
 
Of course, some systems still use XMODEM, so it is handy to have an
alias (according to the first category above) that reads:
 
	XMODEM=KMD kmd $*
 
But why require the user to type KMD or XMODEM at all?  Why not allow
the option letters alone.  I provide the following set of aliases so
that users can invoke file transfer operations by entering the KMD
option letters alone as commands (along with other forms):
 
	S=SEND=DOWN.LOAD kmd s $1
	SK=SENDK=DOWNK kmd sk $1
	SP=SENDP=DOWNP kmd sp $1

	RP kmd rp $1
	L=LIBSEND=SENDL=DOWNL kmd l $1 $2
	LK=LIBSENDK=SENDLK=DOWNLK kmd l $1 $2
 
Most of the longer alternative forms will never be used, but I decided
to be a 'big spender' and squander a hundred bytes!  Many of my users
(and I, myself) use the option letter alternatives -- with a leading
space or slash -- all the time.  I usually spruce up the aliases with
messages, so the SK alias might have a command script of:
 
	echo s%>ending file %<$1 (1k %>protocol);kmd sk $*
 
Even fancier scripts can be concocted.  One word of caution.  If you
allow the 'R' and 'SP' aliases, you cannot have the reset and space
commands in your RCP with the standard names.  I have them but have
changed the names to 'RES' and 'SPAC' respectively.
 
 
How to Implement ARUNZ
----------------------
 
     I would like to close with some tips on how to implement the scheme
described above.  Setting up ARUNZ as the extended command processor is
described in the ZCPR33 Users Guide and in the documentation with ARUNZ. 
Basically, one renames ARUNZ.COM to CMDRUN.COM and places it in the root
directory (the last one listed in the symbolic path).  ARUNZ can be
configured to look for ALIAS.CMD either along the entire path, in the
root directory, or in a specifically designated directory.  I recommend
one of the latter two alternatives.
 
     The main trick I would like to call to everyone's attention is a
way to make ARUNZ perform at top speed as an extended command processor. 
That is to arrange your disk so that the ARUNZ.COM and ALIAS.CMD files
are listed near the beginning of the disk directory and are stored near
the beginning of the disk data area.
 
     If you are starting with a fresh diskette (or hard disk), this is
easy.  Just copy these two files onto the disk first.  The question is,
what do you do if the disk already has files on it?  Here is what I do. 
Run DU3 and go to group 0 (command 'G0'), where the directory starts. 
Note which files are at the beginning of the directory, and note which
files have low group numbers allocated to them.
 
     To make things concrete, suppose we find two unimportant files
called NOTIMP1 and NOTIMP2 that meet these requirements and consume
enough allocation groups to accommodate ARUNZ.COM and ALIAS.COM.  First
we have to get these files out of the way.  We do this by copying them
to new names with commands like:
 
	PPIP NOTIMP1A=NOTIMP1;GO NOTIMP2A=NOTIMP2
 
(If they are in different user areas, then we include the user numbers
in the commands.)  Then we erase the original files to free up the
directory and disk space:
 
	ERA NOTIMP1;ERA NOTIMP2
 
Next we copy ARUNZ.COM and ALIAS.COM into their place.  Suppose, to deal
with the most complex case, that these files are already in the current
directory and that ARUNZ.COM is already called CMDRUN.COM.  We use the
following commands to move them into place:
 
	PPIP CMDRUN1.COM=CMDRUN.COM;GO ALIAS1.CMD=ALIAS.CMD
	REN CMDRUN.COM=CMDRUN1.COM;REN ALIAS.CMD=ALIAS1.CMD
 
With the rename commands, we answer 'Y' when prompted about deleting the
existing files.  Finally, we rename the two files that we moved out of
the way:
 
	REN NOTIMP1=NOTIMP1A;REN NOTIMP2=NOTIMP2A
 
If CMDRUN.COM and/or ALIAS.CMD had previously been stored in high group
numbers, you should now notice a very dramatic improvement in system
response (at least when you go to the ECP directly by entering commands
with a leading space or slash).  I get almost RAM-disk performance on my
system.

  I have several questions in regard to the SIMTEL20 server.

  1)  I requested a copy of the CRC list for the SIG/M area of the archive
      but was unable to dearchive it (PC-ARC said some nonsense about
      it could only decode 12-bit archives). What versions of ARC and
      uuencode are used to build archives?

  2)  Could this problem be caused by the uuencoded file getting mangled
      by some intermediate machine? I suspect that this what is going on.
      Any suggestions on how to fix this?

Has anyone on the net successfully used a 20Mb disk (or anything greater than
10Mb) with a Televideo 803H.  This probably requires knowledge of the BIOS 
so that the DPBs and DPHs can be set up for several logical disks.  By the way
this question relates to CP/M 2.2.

Dave,

The Archive Server invokes a faithful version of ARC 5.10, but with an
added option to significantly speed up the processing: the Q (for
Quick) option, which bypasses all the tests of the various
compression techniques and unconditionally compresses the input file.
That compression uses a 12-bit mode vs. the 16-bit mode used by the
Unix compress program.

The uuencode algorithm is built directly into the server program.  It
has been slightly modified to append a trailing "M" to each line of
output to preserve any trailing spaces resulting from the uuencode
process.  This change was made expressly for the BITNET recipients
whose mailers want to suppress those trailing blanks.  A properly
implemented uudecode will ignore those trailing Ms.

One way to fight the FCC proposal is to contact your congressman.
Congress has frequently overridden the FCC on unpopular rulings by
changing the law.  Also, when you call or write your congressman,
he/she will contact the FCC to ask what's going on.  When the FCC gets
a lot of calls from congressman they get nervous (and rightly so
because their budget can be cut).

This transformation is annoying in that Binhex 4.0 files are wasted and

contributor, having produced a series of articles on the SCSI interface. 
The articles are very wide ranging, including both hardware and software. 
There was a pair of fascinating articles on the art and science of soldering
and unsoldering!  A piece on disassembly techniques called "The Art of
Source Code Generation" was written by the individual who sells those famous
packages that will convert your Turbo Pascal and other programs to commented
source code.  Most of the people I have gotten to subscribe to TCJ have been
very happy with it, so I feel reasonably confident in recommending it.

A couple possibilities:

Bruce Kendall, if he is still at Corvus SJ, is likely to be much more helpful
than corporate representatives. This was my experience from about 4 years ago
anyway.

Failing that, I suspect that Earth Computers (in San Diego) is run by one
Ron Alspaugh, formerly of Alspa Computer, Inc, and it is possible that he
would have a copy of the utilities around..

Hi, everybody, I've very recently inherited a CP/M system and I was 
wondering if anyone has public domain software that they could give to me.
I'm not picky- anything at all is fine- word processing, text adventures,
anything. Also, would anyone know of any CP/M BBS's that I could call?-
or for that  matter, are there any software companies out there that 
still publish stuff for CP/M?

I am thinking of picking up an Epson Geneva (portable CP/M system), and
I was wondering if anyone had any real-life opinions from it (or info).

How do you access the on-board cassette drive (does it look like a floppy?
or do you have to stream to it?)

How is the display (it's LCD, and I worry about readability)

I would be getting it with a 64K ramdisk, not the 120K version.  Can I
expand this with just plugging in more RAM chips?

Thanks in advance.

I have a friend who has been using an Epson Geneva (also known as PX-8)
for about a year, and he loves it!

The tape drive acts pretty much like a floppy, but it is incredibly S-L-O-W.
If you get one you may want to look into getting one of the battery powered
3.5 inch disk drives.

The display seems all right.  Not outstanding, but adequate.  You can
usually adjust it to a readable level.

Don't think you can add to the 64K ramdisk.  If I find out otherwise, I'll
let you know.

One thing that has impressed me is how the thing acts when power goes down
on the internal NiCad batteries - it beeps, shuts itself down, and waits
for you to plug in the charger.  It then takes up right where it left off -
even in the middle of a download!

My (second hand) observations are that it is a nice little portable.  It is
maybe not a substitute for a full sized computer, but if portability is
important, it's a good way to go.  I would really look at a disk drive for
it, since it takes literally minutes to load off the tape drive.  My friend
packs the computer, disk drive, cables, and disks in a small backpack type
carrier for transport.
The terminal emulation is SOROC (same as Apple CP/M).

Might also mention that CP/M COMAL is now available from COMAL Users Group
USA; 6041 Monona Drive; Madison WI.  COMAL is the best programming
language I have seen!  Has the BEST features of PASCAL and BASIC.
Also a demo version is available as DEMCOMAL.LBR on SIMTEL and GEnie.

Try it, you'll like it!

(price is $49.95 + $5 shipping)

Hi, Peter.

Could you be more specific about the CP/M system you inherited?  If you can access this list you can access much stuff from the Simtel archives, but I am sure
you will hear about it from others through info-cpm.

comp.sys.mac, the other from comp.sys.amiga.  Since this seems likely
to be or become a crisis for the community of people who use computer
networks regularly, (I figure my own usage cost would go from the
current $25 I pay for "unlimited use" private phone service to my
local Baby Bell, to about $1525, per month, for my 10 hours per day
online.  OK, I admit it, I'm hooked. ;-), I hope you will forgive the
repeat posting.  I do think this satisfies the above query.  Please
feel free to spread the word to other services.  My thanks to the
excellent efforts by the authors of these two articles.

Subject: HOW TO RESPOND TO THE FCC REGARDING THEIR PROPOSAL
Date: 19 Jun 87 21:44:35 GMT
Old-Subject: Re: ATTENTION ALL MICRO USERS!!! FCC INFORMATION TAX AHEAD!!

John D. Hays asked for someone to post a sample letter for addressing
comments to the FCC regarding their future proposal to surcharge
Enhanced Service Providers (such as Tymnet, Telnet, etc.).

First of all, THE FCC HAS NOT RELEASED THE DOCKET!  Sending in
comments before the docket is released would be bad manners.  The FCC
said that the docket should be released in a couple of weeks.  To save
hassle, I'll send out a message when the docket is available for
public consumption, as well as a lead to where you might obtain said
document.  Keep an eye out in these newsgroups.

The FCC General Docket number is 87-215.  The TITLE is "Amendment of
Part 69 of the Commission's rules relating to Enhanced Service
Providers."

An example of how to reply to FCC docket 87-215.

Below you will find such a beast.  This sample is taken from a recent
posting I made to rec.ham-radio to oppose a proposal the FCC was
making to remove certain Amateur Radio frequencies.  It is a tried and
true format that the FCC will consider valid, AS LONG AS YOU FOLLOW
THE GUIDELINES LISTED.

Take this opportunity to respond to the FCC.  They love to let things
slide, and to save something, all it takes is a LOT of people writing
letters like what is provided below.  We've done it before for ham
radio -- it can be done here.

If you have questions or concerns, PLEASE email me.  I'll gladly
answer any questions about writing the FCC that I can.  Just ask.

(The example below mentions a list of possible reasons why you might
want to oppose this proposal.  Since the docket hasn't been released,
I'm not going to include any reasons yet.  As soon as I get a copy of
the docket, I'll post reasons and references.  Stay tuned.)

---------------------- HOW TO REPLY TO FCC DOCKETS ---------------------------
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The following is a do-it-yourself-kit for responding to FCC docket 87-215
regarding amendment of Part 69 relating to Enhanced Service Providers.

Before I get started with the actual "form letter," let me take this
opportunity to make a few comments regarding responding to the FCC.

EVEN IF YOU DON'T BOTHER WITH THE SAMPLE LETTER STUFF, THE FOLLOWING
INFORMATION IS USEFUL AND IMPORTANT TO THE SUCCESS OF YOUR RESPONSE.

1) If you really want to make an impression on the Commissioners, SEND
   MORE THAN ONE COPY OF YOUR RESPONSE.  Send FIVE copies.  If you want
   to make an even better impression, send ELEVEN copies.  Five copies
   makes sure that your vote counts, as well as provides a copy for each
   of the general groups.  Eleven copies will get your document in the
   'IN' basket of each Commissioner.  If this isn't possible, even ONE letter
   counts as a vote.  Don't send more than 11.  Just 11 will do.

2) DON'T SEND FORM LETTERS!  While I referred to this message as a "form
   letter," it really isn't.  Form letters are usually not worth the effort
   you put into them.  Why, you ask?  Well, while each form letter you
   send gets counted as a vote, it can be rejected later.  If it turns out
   that we win this round, it is entirely probable that OUR OPPONENTS WILL
   ASK TO GO THROUGH EACH AND EVERY RESPONSE.  If they can show that 100
   responses are identical (or closely similar) with the exception of the
   signature, THEY CAN BE REDUCED TO ONLY ONE VOTE!  Make sure your letter
   is sufficiently different enough not to get caught by this.

3) LIMIT YOUR MAIN ARGUMENTS TO ONE PAGE.  If you want to go into more detail,
   augment your document with additional pages expanding on your original
   comments, keying to those original points.  Number your points.

4) Give REASONABLE REASONS why you oppose this docket.  You can't just say
   that you oppose the rule-making without a sound, reasonable response.
   REMEMBER THAT THE OPPOSITION WILL READ EACH AND EVERY RESPONSE YOU SEND,
   if it can benefit them.  We don't have that type of financial backing;
   they *DO*.  Use some of the samples below if you're stuck for ideas.

5) MAKE A STATEMENT ABOUT WHO YOU ARE AND WHAT YOU DO.  How important you
   are actually makes a difference.  If you have a certain expertise, or if
   you have a degree of some sort, TELL THEM THAT.  It counts a lot for what
   the commissioners think if they know you are someone who knows what you
   are talking about.  If you run a service, are an administrator, offer
   services to the public, etc., briefly describe what you do and why.

6) DOUBLE SPACE YOUR DOCUMENT.  This can make the difference between your
   response being read or just counted!  If your response is CLEAR, DOUBLE
   SPACED, and CONCISE, it will be read and given a better subjective value.

7) GET YOUR NEIGHBORS INTO THE ACT.  If your friends and/or neighbors are
   familiar with your activities and support you and your activities, ask them 
   to write a letter to the FCC expressing their concern over how this docket
   might affect your community.  If you can get local officials to do the
   same, great!  Letterhead and many copies make the BEST response. 

8) MAKE SURE THE DATE IS ON THE DOCUMENT.  It is important that the reader be
   made aware that this isn't an old response.  Put the date on your document.
   And, of course, DON'T EVER FORGET TO PUT THE DOCKET NUMBER AT THE TOP!!

9) Lastly, remember that this is going to be a very important point in future
   rule-making efforts.  Any time the FCC wins a battle, whether by apathy or
   some other means, it is a big step for them in the future.  If the FCC
   decides in favor of this docket, it's likely that you will see more of the
   same type later on.  Private agencies will see how easily it went over and
   base future requests on that information.  If we win, it will make it tough
   for anyone to raise the issue again.  If a specific proposal fails to make
   it through a certain number of times (because of the public's efforts), the
   commissioners tend to NOT reconsider it again during their term...

   Even if you don't bother with this proposal, you have a vested interest in
   what happens to it.  Eventually, THIS *WILL* AFFECT YOU!


Okay, enough preaching.  On to the "form letter."  Basically, you will want to
create a letter which has the name of the FCC at the top, AS WELL AS A CLEAR
POINTER TO THE DOCKET NUMBER.  If the people at the FCC have to search for a
docket reference, they'll "loose" your response.

Here's an example first page header:

+----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                            Before the                                |
|                  FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION                   |
|                       Washington DC  20554                           |
|                                                                      |
|                                                                      |
| In the Matter of                    \                                |
|                                      \                               |
| Amendment of Part 69 of the           >  GENERAL DOCKET  87 - 215    |
| Commission's Rules relating to       /                               |
| Enhanced Service Providers          /                                |
|                                                                      |
| TO:  The Commission                                                  |
|                                                                      |
|          COMMENTS OF <your full name>, <any professional titles>     |
|                                                                      |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------+

After you have created the header, you can begin your text, DOUBLE-SPACED.

Begin by expressing who you are and any specific titles, duties, or any
responsibilities that might qualify you as someone who has a vested interest
in what's going before their consideration.  Even only as a user of this
network is suitable.  Now is NOT the time to be humble, however.  Just
tactfully explain what makes you significant to this proposal.  YOU'RE OUT
TO MAKE AN IMPRESSION.  DO SO!  (Don't be verbose, however.)

Then, begin listing the reasons (numbered) WHY you oppose this proposal.
The more reasonable the reason, the better.  BE CONCISE and clear.  If you
need to go into detail, refer the reader to attached pages.

Here's an example:

+----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                                                                      |
| I am a user of an Enhanced Service Provider.  I frequently make use  |
|                                                                      |
| of such services to obtain information from computer information     |
|                                                                      |
| services that would otherwise be unavailable to me.  The information |
|                                                                      |
| I obtain allows me to <something...>.                                |
|                                                                      |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------+

After you've explained who you are, and have shown why you have an interest
in this docket, continue with...

+----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                                                                      |
| I strongly oppose the Commission's proposal to surcharge Enhanced    |
|                                                                      |
| Service Providers for the following reasons:                         |
|                                                                      |
| 1.  <reason one>                                                     |
|                                                                      |
| 2.  <reason two>                                                     |
|                                                                      |
| 3.  <whatever comments you feel appropriate to your situation>       |
|                                                                      |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------+

Remember, you don't need to be verbose to get your point across.  You
want to make sure the reader understands why you feel the way you do.
If you need additional material in order to accomplish this, feel free to
include additional pages, however if you are only interested in making
your feelings known and don't want to get really in-depth, the simple
statements like the ones pictured above are sufficient to make your point.

Where you can refer to the text of the original document, DO SO!  This is
great for those who like to know exactly what you are referring to.  It
also shows that you have done your homework and are not just spouting off.

The best mode of attack in instances like this is to first explain WHY you
are against the proposal.  Once you have made it clear that there are good
reasons why this wouldn't be a good thing, SUGGEST ALTERNATE IDEAS.  It can
go a long way for your arguments if you can suggest a viable alternative.

There are lots of reasons you can supply.  I've listed about 10 that come
to mind at the bottom of this message.  Please use them if you like, however
any that are pertinent to your local situation are going to be the better
responses.

Finally, follow up your reasons with a nice suffix like:

+----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                                    Respectfully submitted,           |
|                                       <sign in BLACK INK>            |
|                                    <your spelled-out name and title> |
|                                                                      |
|                                                                      |
|  <your street address>                                               |
|  <your city, state, and zipcode>                                     |
|  <THE DATE>                                                          |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------+

Black ink is important when you sign your response.  Also, make sure
that you send the original.  Copies for yourself, original to the people
you are writing to.  Please make sure you sign it and date it.

If you have included additional pages, it would be wise to include a
trailer at the bottom of each page, designating what page out of the
total number of pages this is.  Example:

+----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Responses to General Docket 87-215                       Page 1 of 3 |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------+

Finally, place a return address on your envelope, place the correct postage
on it, and mail it SOON!  If you can spend the extra cash, don't fold your
responses; mail them in a larger manila envelope and keep them flat.  This
is especially useful if you are sending multiple copies.  Chances are that
it will get there in one piece, and will look great sitting on the desk of
some Commissioner (flat).

The key to remember is that you are out to make a feasible point about the
docket.  You don't want to sound like you don't know what you are talking
about, so be sure of your facts.  You can best do this by being concise,
clear, correct, and impressive.  The impressive part comes to bear when you
consider arrangement and looks of your document as well as your status in
the topic under consideration.

If you have any questions, please contact me!  This document was prepared
by Bruce Bergman, N7HAW, Northern San Diego County EC.  To the best of my
knowledge, all the information contained herein is correct.  Comments,
corrections, etc. are welcome and encouraged.

When last we saw our hero, keithd@cadovax.UUCP (Keith Doyle) ...
>In article <2288@husc6.UUCP> hadeishi@husc4.UUCP (mitsuharu hadeishi) writes:
>>	A terrible piece of news I just read about in the New York Times
>>this morning.  The FCC just voted 4-0 to impose a $4.50 - $5.50 an HOUR
>>tax on people who are using the phone system to transmit information
>>across state lines.

After seeing all of the various versions of this, I decided to contact
the FCC myself and get the facts straight:

In 1983, the FCC adopted an access charge plan where every secondary
user of local telephone services would be charged a tariff based on
the costs of the local exchange. Two groups were exempted from this
tariff -- resellers (those who buy telephone service in bulk and
resell it at reduced prices) and enhanced service providers (data
retrieval, manipulation, and transmission). This year, the resellers
were removed from exemption. 

In a couple of weeks, the FCC will announce a *notice*of*inquiry*. Not
a tariff, but a request for comments on a proposed rule change. The
proposal is to add enhanced service providers back into the access
charge plan. Although the local rates will vary, the national average
should be about $0.09/minute.

If you would like a copy of the notice of inquiry and instructions on
how to submit comments, contact International Transcription Services,
(202)857-3800. There will probably be a summary in the Federal
Register. If you would like to make a comment, you may also mail a
letter directly to the FCC, but I am unsure whether they will be
received or acknowledged. Send your letters to

	The Hon. Dennis Patrick, Chairman, FCC
	1919 M Street NW
	Washington, D.C. 20554

In your letter, state that this is in reference to docket number 87-215.
Also, send a copy to your elected representatives.

If you have further queries, you may contact the FCC at (202)632-4047.
Tell them that you have a query about docket number 87-215.

	"I am thinking of picking up an Epson Geneva (portable CP/M
	system), and I was wondering if anyone had any real-life
	opinions from it (or info)."

I have one of these, bought it at list price when it was the best
laptop on the market.  You can get them from DAK for just a few hundred
bucks.  It runs standard CP/M-80 on a CMOS Z80 lookalike.

The biggest drawback is the slow screen draw rate.  The display is
eight lines of 80 characters, and output to it is effectively less than
1200 baud.  This is okay for entering a first draft (composing a
document), but isn't acceptable when editing, at least for me.

	"How do you access the on-board cassette drive (does it look
	like a floppy?  or do you have to stream to it?)"

The cassette is drive H:.  It looks just like a CP/M disk but you can
only have one file open at a time.  It has a directory in the first few
blocks.  Output to it is effectively 300 baud so this device is all but
USELESS for file storage.  Forget it!

	"How is the display (it's LCD, and I worry about readability)"

It's not readable in low light.  You have to position yourself so that
a light source is overhead and on the other side of the display from
you.  In a room with overhead fluorescent lights there's no problem.

	"I would be getting it with a 64K ramdisk, not the 120K
	version.  Can I expand this with just plugging in more RAM
	chips?"

No.  Get the 120K RAM disk.

I have the 120K RAM disk (it's really 120K not 128K) and the floppy
disk drive, and I rarely use the floppy drive.  The floppy interface is
a serial line at 38400, too slow.  This is okay for backup/restore of
the RAM disk.  The other use I make of it is for the SAVE command in
Infocom games, since those games completely fill the 120K RAM disk.

Subject: PD Z80 assemblers (and ZASM)

Fellow travelers,

I have been looking for a 'good' Z80 macro assembler and have seen several
references to ZASM as a recommended way to go.  Does anyone know where I 
could get it?  I have tried the SIMTEL20 archives but couldn't Find it there.

Does anyone have an alternate suggestion as to favorite Z80 macro assemblers?
I have downloaded Z80MR from SIMTEL but haven't tried it yet.  The only thing
I didn't like about it from reading the docs is the 6 character limit on
labels.  Is the limit in ZASM the same?  Around 16 characters would be
enough, I'm not that verbose.

If you have a favorite commercial version that is *inexpensive* , tell me
about that too.

Also a note to/about Rick Surwilo's Z8E debugger: absolutely amazing!!
If you do any Z80 assembly work, don't miss this one.

ZASM is NOT public domain.  It's copyrighted by Cromemco and somehow
ended up being made available on a few BBS's.  We do not have it on
SIMTEL20.

Z80MR has had many good compliments and is PD.

Subject: re: hard/ram disk for S-100

JEllsworth@HI-MULTICS.ARPA was looking for a hard disk or RAM disk for an
S-100 machine.  A few ideas, taken from my present configuration and my
current wish list:
 
1) Compupro (Viasyn) DISK-3 hard disk controller.  This will talk to any mix of
ST-506 drives, does 24 bit DMA of any number of sectors, can work in track/
sector or absolute sector number mode, and has local intelligence (8085?) to
take care of all the messy details for you.  You set up a 16 byte I/O Parameter
Block in memory and kick the DISK-3.  It reads it into internal memory, does
the requested function (complete with seeks, head settles, etc), and gives you
back (in the IOPB) a completion status.  Writing the software drivers in Z-80
assembly was very simple, and I have yet to have a problem with the board.  I'm
running with 2 ST-225 drives, which seem to work well, in an Integrand disk box,
which is very well built and (I suspect) bulletproof....
 
2) Macrotech 512K VRAM board.  This is kind of expensive for a RAM disk,
but it provides real memory access _and_ RAM disk simultaneously.  I'm using
part of the additional memory for BIOS extensions, I just load up my registers
with the important variables, swap banks, and have more than enough room to
play.  It's nice having 64K free for your BIOS.... :+)  The one thing that bugs
me about the VRAM is that while the memory section is real fast (they do some
handwaving to say it's 12 nS, but the chips are 120 nS), the RAM disk ports
need 2 I/O wait states with a 6 to 8 MHz Z-80.
 
Digital Research Computers LS-II(?).  Not to be confused with the software
company of the same name, you can find them in the back of BYTE.  The Light
Speed II is a 1 Meg version of their LS-I (256K), which I played with last
weekend and was very impressed with.  These are really quite inexpensive,
and should work well if you are just looking for straight RAM disk, and can
handle a little kit assembly.
 
	A little side note:  with the DISK-3 and the VRAM board, you can 
fairly easily whip up a hard disk cache.  You get to the sectors that are
in the cache thru the RAM disk ports, and the DISK-3 does DMA to the memory
side.  This does not work with the LS-II or other 'pure' RAM disks.  Just
on the off chance that you end up with this configuration (or see below),
drop me a line and I'll see about sending you the drivers.  In some simple
benchmarks of 'real world' applications, running a RAM disk made things go
4 times as fast, while the cache was 'only' twice as fast, but the cache
doesn't give 'DISK FULL' errors when it fills up....
 
3) Macrotech ADIT board with external RAM boards.  The ADIT board can substitute
for the RAM disk ports on the VRAM board if you have memory in other banks that
you are not using.  It will do DMA between banks, and also has virtual RAM
disk ports that will keep track of everything for you.  You also get from 4 to
16 I/O ports and a 6 MHz Z80 and 16 or 32K of RAM and a little tiny multitasking
'operating system' in an EPROM that runs everything for you!  I've ordered one
cuz I need some more serial ports, but I suspect I'll be adding a couple of
meg of memory boards for a RAM disk and rewriting my cache software to take
advantage of the ADIT instead of the VRAM.  Wanna buy a VRAM board?  :+)
 
Hope this helps, any questions, feel free to send mail.

Subject: Archive Server Shutdown

Several changes to the Archive Server have been made in the past few
weeks to improve service for replies sent through intermediate hosts.
One of the requested changes was to reduce the size of the messages by
half so that these messages don't hog the single-stream mail
channels, particularly on BITNET, for extended periods of time, and
thus give other mail a chance to get through in a timely manner.

Unfortunately, this has resulted in the SIMTEL20 mail queue to rapidly
grow way beyond all expectations: the Server was now generating twice
as many messages and our dedicated mailer for this service now had to
establish twice as many connections for the same number of replies.
That mailer could not keep up with the the queue, and for the second
time in as many weeks, we have had to shutdown the Server because we
were running out of disk space.

Because the disk space is at a premium for our regular users, and
because the resources required by both the Server and the mailer have
now reached a point well beyond the capabilities of our present system
configuration, the Server has been shut down until further notice and
for an indefinite period of time.  New requests will be returned
unanswered, and both present requests and replies will be flushed.

In the meantime, we are examining other possibilities to provide
access to our collections.  Because the great majority of requests
have come from BITNET users, we are looking for one or more BITNET
hosts willing to provide the disk space and BITSERV facilities for one
or more of our collections of public domain software.

To: info-cpm@simtel20.arpa

Available now are both MS-DOS and CP/M demo versions of the COMAL programming 
language.  These are full implementations except that the SAVE function has
been disabled.  There are several sample programs included.  Feel free to
make copies and pass them around!  List price of the real thing is $69.95
+ $5 shipping from:
  COMAL Users Group USA
  6041 Monona Drive
  Madison WI  53716
Price is $49.95 plus shipping for COMAL Today subscribers - CP/M version
is now shipping, MS-DOS should be ready soon.

WHAT IS COMAL?

Briefly, it is a programming language designed to combine the best features of
BASIC and Pascal.  It was designed by a professor in Denmark, and is now the
official first programming language taught in several European countries.
Until recently, available here only for COMMODORE computers, and an
expensive($500) IBM version;  it is the most often purchased language for
the C64.

The language offers an interactive environment like BASIC, but offers logn
variable names, named procedures and functions, parameter passing, local and
global variables, and four loop structures (FOR, REPEAT-UNTIL, WHILE-ENDWHILE,
and LOOP-ENDLOOP).  It is the only structured language I know of with system
forced indents - your structures are all properly indented by the system!
You'll appreciate that if you ever have to modify your programs.  It also
provides three easy methods for interfacing ML routines - I already have
written an RGB graphics package (640X200) for C128 CP/M+.

Look for DEMCOMAL.LBR on GEnie or on SIMTEL.

Try it, you'll like it!

I am really sorry to hear that.  My RQP/M and half the users in my area
rely upon my simtel20 downloads.  Unfortunately, being on a LOW student budget,
I cannot afford any LD phone calls or PCP.  The only two boards that are bigger
than my 50M storage are pretty clogged up, and babysitting time for 1200
baud even if I can get through is a drag.  At least with the Sun, I can FTP
in one window while doing REAL work in the other.....

Well, I can't say I blame you.  Just let us know when and where the CP/M
section becomes available again.  I just hope it is something I can reach
from here.....

Thought I'd throw in my 0.02$  ...

there is a disk controller card that has a 
hard disk
8"  All known soft-sector cpm formats
5"  All known soft-sector cpm formats
and DMA ram disk

all on one card!!
track buffering is implemented to provide very fast floppy i/o. DMA will work
in multimaster mode in 16bits. 5mhz 8085 on board. Source is given out with
purchase of the board for some small anount more.  Works upto 12mhz ..

This is available from fulcrum computer products -- 707 433 0202

They also make super fast 256k / 1M static cards with the battery backup on
 board... makes for a great ramdisk. NO NEED TO COPY STUFF OVER ON POWER UP!!

Just a reminder that all the new files on SIMTEL20 announced to
Info-Cpm are also available on my RCP/M (accessable via PC-Pursuit)
and on GEnie's CP/M RoundTable.

> Can you tell me what the difference is?

Yes, DEM2CMAL.LBR is an update to DEMCOMAL.LBR.  It has more demos and
contains more info on the Comal language.  Also included is a file
that contains all the commands and their syntax.

Now available from SIMTEL20:

Filename                        Type     Bytes   CRC

Directory PD:<CPM.FILUTL>
CRCKK33.LBR.1                   BINARY   41216  A287H


crckk.com  --  A FAST Universal Z80 CP/M file CRC checking program
             with a Unix (tm of AT&T) flavor.

                           Version 3.3

   
Crckk now uses FOUR different crc polynomials and can apply them to
files in a variety of different ways.  Crckk.com fully replaces the
programs crck.com and ccitcrc.com.  Some uses of lu.com and
(un)arc.com are also displaced.

Crckk can be used to verify files gotten from "the simtel" archives,
"lu" archives, "arc" archives, as well as any archives that use the
program ccitcrc.

Crckk now has an option, which when invoked, will automatically patch
files so that they will have a CRC value of zero.  This could be used
to patch all of one's "system" files on your floppy, then when you
want to verify the integrity of your disk, you just check the file(s)
for a zero CRC (no need to remember the crc and no need to keep a
list "somewhere").

Crckk, as in the past, executes all of the above FAST.

    >>-------- Differences: Version 3.1 ==> 3.3 --------<<

            (Note: version 3.2 was not "released".)


Cleaned up initial messages and error detection to better reflect the
mode being run.
   
Fixed minor bug in sector-count counting.

Added "-a" option that changes the CRC calculation from the default
"standard CRCK" to that polynomial used by the popular "ARC" program.
"CRCK -a" of a file will yield the same CRC as in "ARC".
   
Added "-s" option that calculates CRC's using the same polynomial
that the program CCITCRC does.  

Added "-l" option that calculates CRC's using the same polynomial
that the library-archive "LU" program does. This is also the same as
XMODEM as well.

Instead, of just telling you the bytes you *could* have used to patch
a file with (as CCITCRC does) to make it's CRC zero, I added option
'-p' that DOES the patch for you.  This '-p' patching works for the
'-a' ARC CRC mode, the '-l' LU/XMODEM mode, and for the '-s' CCITCRC
mode.

Keeping in the tradition of CRCKK being a FAST executing CP/M-Z80
program...  When running ccitcrc "mode" (a new crckk feature), CRCKK
runs about 30% faster than ccitcrc when the program and data files
are "in RAM cache".  CRCKK runs about 300% faster than CCITCRC when
the files are NOT in cache or RAMdisk, but in floppy (with *my* CP/M
3.0 system).  Your mileage may vary.
