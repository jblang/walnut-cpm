One of my friends got hold on a Z80-card for the C64 that you need to
run CP/M, but the card wasn't (and has never been) stable! You may get
it to run for a couple of minuts before it went on to Guru meditation!

Buy a C128 ("did I really write that!" (buy a CPC6128 instead - it's
much faster!))

You probably do not even want to try it... the reason CBM doesn't market it
anymore is because it is my understanding that it was such a severly flawed
product and the Federal Trade Commission demanded that they remove it from
the market and provide refunds.  This of course didn't help me, because I
found out after I bought one of the silly things.  Half of the chips in mine
were bad even at that, and after socketing the whole thing and replacing
the bad chips it sometimes boots but crashes soon after that.  Apparently
it has something to do with revisions made to the SID chips that are present
in almost ALL C64s but were not present in the machine(s) they designed
the cartridge around.  Someone with an SX-64 out there in net land however
swore to me once that theirs worked, although you will find that this is
not the general experience of people in the free world.  Mine works so poorly
that I wouldn't even believe him except that someone in a Dr. Dobbs many
moons ago (Walter Biolifsky or something like that) actually got an XMODEM
flying for his C64 under CP/M, which is still available on the BBSes so some-
body must be downloading it.  I sincerely hope someone on the net can tell
me I'm all wrong and here-is-how-to-fix-it, but I've asked before.  FYI I
found mine in a K-Mart about 2-3 years ago when they were cleaning out their
C64 stuff.

I called CBM myself about this, which took many, many attempts, and the guy
I finally got hold of said they only give refunds or exchanges for software,
that there is no fix, and that none of the units ever worked.

Hope that helps.

Date: Mon 01 Aug 1988 12:35:02 EDT
From: <SAGE@LL.ARPA>
Subject: Update on SLR Systems' OPTASM Assembler

   I just got a very exciting letter from SLR Systems about version 1.5 of
their fantastic MS-DOS assembler, OPTASM.  Although this is a CP/M
newsgroup, many of you, like me, probably do some work in MS-DOS as well
(dare I admit it in public).  And perhaps like me, you find that the MS-DOS
world just doesn't suit your taste (lacking CP/M's intimacy, among other
things) and you do not follow its newsgroup very carefully.  Therefore, I
would like to pass on the information about OPTASM here as well.
 
   Two very important features have now been added to OPTASM: compatibility
with the MicroSoft CodeView debugger and an on-line, hot-key  help facility.
The CodeView debugger allows the assembled source code listing to be used
while debugging (wouldn't that be nice with CP/M -- but we probably don't
have enough memory space to support it).  The lack of that capability before
was probably the only reason anyone could have had for considering any other
MS-DOS assembler.
 
   The on-line help facility essentially puts the OPTASM User's Guide on
line while you are writing code.  The system is even extensible, so you can
add particular information that you find helpful.  The update price to
registered owners is only $29.95, free if you acquired OPTASM after July 1,
1988.
 
   I called SLR Systems immediately to order my own update and learned a
second piece of exciting news.  The list price of OPTASM has been reduced
from $195 to only $125!  Anyone who does any significant amount of MS-DOS
assembly language work should certainly get a copy of this assembler.  If
you want to try it out, there is even a demo version, which is the complete
product except for the on-line help files, only it's object file output is
disabled.  But if you want to see how fast it is and how nice some of the
special features are, the demo might be useful.  The file is called
OADEMO.ARC and can be downloaded from the SLR remote access computer system
at 412-282-2799 (or for a fee they will provide it on disk).  SLR Systems
can be reached at 800-833-3061 (orders only), but you might want to try some
major mail-order houses, where the product is probably available at a
discount.
 
   Disclaimer: My wife's company, SME, is a dealer for SLR Systems and
actively sells their 8-bit assembly language products (she targets the 8-bit
market in general, and, besides, it's hard to compete with big mail-order
houses on MS-DOS products).  I am a user of SLR's products, particularly the
8-bit ones, and I find them so utterly outstanding that I would like to see
SLR succeed and be encouraged to work their magic on still more tools.
After all, how often do products come along that are three to four TIMES
faster than their competitors' and have better features as well?

I don't quite understand.. is there a CP/M 5.0 already out that they'd port to
CP/M, or is it that they are thinking about doing a new (CP/M) version?

No, I mean WordStar 5.0, not a new version of CP/M.  WordStar 5.0 has windows,
improved laser printer support, and other goodies.  If you are after a new
version of CP/M, try ZCPR3.

My apologies, I must have been asleep when I wrote that.
I meant to say *WordStar*, not CP/M!

(Having been the engineering department for a CP/M manufacturer many years ago
I ought to know the difference! and I'm fairly happy with ZCPR3/P2DOS21..)

I just wanted some kind of rundown on the advantages of W* 5.0 over 4.0, and
was curious about CP/M WordStar 5.0's "ancestry". What else can you tell us 
about 5.0?

As a volunteer consultant for the Boston Computer Society, I was
contacted by a person who has a Burroughs Redactor-3 computer running
a 48K CP/M-2.2 with two hard-sectored disk drives (Lanier diskettes
work, probably 8 or 10 sectors).  He has only the CP/M boot disk and
no documentation at all.  We would appreciate any information anyone
can offer about the machine, especially about the types and port
addresses of any serial ports.  As things stand, there is obviously a
serious difficulty with getting any software onto the machine.  The
greatest boon would be if someone out there actually has the machine
and a communications program and could send us a diskette with the
latter.

Kermit for the machine.  I have ftp access to both CU20B and Simtel20
but I have no idea which CP/M version to get (if there is more than one
version).  I do have all the manuals for the machine and the machine
does have a serial interface.  Thanks for any help you can give me.

Help!

I recently aquired a S-100 bus machine with mostly Compupro  boards in
it, and I need some help.

Though the machine came with a pair of  8" drives  (Tandon SSDD), I've
got a pair of  Pertec DSDD (Shugart 851-type) drives  I'd like to hook
up, since the  Compupro  CP/M can  handle DSDD.  Just  hooking them up
doesn't seem to work (on *this* system), however; I suspect  that I've
got to change  some drive shunts/traces.  Is there   anyone  out there
that knows in detail  what I  need to do?   The Compupro documentation
seems to know about a lot of drives, but not mine.

I need to play some intimate games with my model II disc controller but I know

help.

Does the controller use a Western Digital chip like most of the world or is
this something the guys at Radio Shack devised?  I need such info to make the
Dysan DDD11.ASM disc analysis program work.

All this could have been avoided if the two people who said they had Model II

RS carries the manuals as a special order item.  There is also a disk
drive diagnostic program (used in testing the Model 16/16a/6000) that
is used for disk drive alignment.  The former is not expensive; the
latter is.  The system also uses standard 8" drives; you could
disconnect them from the II electronics and run a cable to a system
for which DDD does work.

I believe that the II does use the WD 17XX chip. The controller is not
very good (disks that do not work on it work fine on my IMSAI with
Tarbell DD controller).

Subject: Transition from CP/M to MS-DOS

I am considering moving from my tried and true Kaypro CP/M  system to an
IBM PC Clone of some sort.  Considering how fast I have been moving,
I may wait until next year when memory prices come down and the 386 
marketplace heats up.  Basically, I am getting frustrated with wanting
to exchange data from files created under "Perfect Writer/Calc/Filer"
with IBM systems running Enable and Multi-mate/Ventura Publishing software.
I also have household databases, and documents which I wouldn't want to
loose if some irreplacible part went on my Kaypro.  Could someone who has
been through it give me some sage advice.  Also I kind of like some of
the features of the Perfect series, do Z80 boards, and CP/M (or ZCPR) exist
for the 286 or 386 machines?.  I am seriously short of knowledge in the 
IBM PC area, and I am looking for a good inexpensive machine.   I am also 
looking for conversion software, and good PD or inexpensive software
for home use.  I work with computers enough at work, I mainly do writing,
household budgets, and household inventory things at home, but when I want
to assist in writing something, I need to be compatible with others running
MS-DOS.  I want to thank in advance all of you who are willing to share
your expertise and experiences with me.

You have several options available to you.  I currently run a Xerox 
820 CP/M system at home.  I also use a lot of different PC type systems
at work.  I use UNIFORM from MicroSolutions to allow me to read/write
PC disks on my CP/M system.  As long as I write ASCII files, I can
easily transfer them and use them on a PC.

MicroSolutions also markets a Z-80 card to allow PCs to run CP/M.  I
have not used it, but, I understand it allows you to put your CP/M files
and software in a separate directory and execute any CP/M program 
on the PC.  

Also, a shareware Z-80 emulator program is available from most PC BBS
systems.  It is also available from SIMTEL20.  It is called Z80MU310.ARC.
It allows you to emulate the Z-80 processor (and run CP/M programs) on
a PC.  The disadvantage to this method is primarily slow speed.  Because
it is an emulator which must translate EVERY Z-80 instruction to a 
comparable 8088/8086 instruction, the execution is not very fast.  I 
believe I read that on a standard PC, the speed was equivilent to
running a Z-80 at about 1 MHz.  That is about 1/4 to 1/2 as fast as
a Kaypro.  If you buy a 16 Mhz 286/386 type machine the emulation would
be much faster.

If you have any other questions, you can post messages here, or 
E-Mail me at the address in this message header.

I run a Fergusson Big Board CP/M system as well as an Atari 1040 ST at home.
I recently downloaded a Z80 CP/M emulator for the ST from an arpanet host.
It works with everything I've tried so far (Wordstar, DBASE II) and the 
emulation speed is not too bad. The documentation is not perfect, however and
it took me a few tries to figure out that it acts like a H/Z 89 terminal.

Transferring files is a bit of a pain -- I use mdm712 on the BB side and 
Uniterm (the absolutely greatest piece of PD software I've ever seen) on the
ST side. Then you have to go through a conversion process to convert the Atari
TOS files to CP/M format. I haven't come to a complete conclusion, but I may
someday accede to my wife's request to free up the table-space now taken up
by the Big Board. 

Oh, yeah, the ST is a nice computer in its own right, too. There is quite a
bit of stuff for it, I personally know of software/hardware emulation packages
available which make it do 
	CP/M
	IBM PC (sort of slow)
	Apple Macintosh (faster than the real thing and with a bigger screen!)

Subject: ZCPR3.3 installation

Rather belatedly I have started to use ZCPR3.3 after several years of
using ZCPR2.  I am, however, having some trouble with the particular
installation that I would like to use, and I am looking for some
assistance.  
 
The system that I use is an Apple //+ with a PCPI Applicard CP/M card.
I have a 512K RAM disk on the Applicard.  I would like to arrange the
ZCPR3.3 system so that the RAM disk is drive A: two 5.25" floppies are
B: and C: and two 8" floppies are D: and E:  The standard Applicard
INSTALL process allows an AUTOST.COM file on either A: or B: (only).
After setting up various buffer areas and the PATH, AUTOST finishes by
invoking STARTUP.  I have successfully installed ZCPR3.3 by making the
first (boot) 5.25" drive A: the second 5.25" B: and the RAM disk C: etc.
However, if I try to make my desired configuration (RAM disk A: etc),
LDR.COM cannot find the SYS.* files, unless I put them on the A: drive
first.  This is obviously not practical in the case of a cold boot from
power off, as A: is the RAM disk.  
 
I think that I am using a fairly standard STARTUP alias (LDR
SYS.FCP,SYS.NDR,SYS etc...) and I have set the path as A0,A15,B0,B15.
With this path the SYS.* files cannot be found on the B:, which I don't
understand.  I have made up an alternative STARTUP alias which is 
LDR B:SYS.FCP,B:NDR etc, but the SYS.* files are still not found. It
appears that they must be on the A: drive for the boot to be completed.
Is it possible to change this ?  I have moved the SYS.* files onto the
RAM disk after an incomplete boot and then run STARTUP again and the
boot will complete properly.  Also if I leave them on the RAM disk and
do a cold boot without turning the power off (which I can do with the
Applicard), the boot goes through to completion.
 
I am obviously doing something wrong, as I cannot imagine that the SYS.*
files must be on the A: drive.  Any help would be appreciated.
