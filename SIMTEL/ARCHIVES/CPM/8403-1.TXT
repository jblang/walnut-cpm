Subject: Need tech data for WECo 300/1200 Dataphone modem
To: INFO-CPM@mit-mc, INFO-MICRO@mit-mc
cc: PLEHN@mit-mc

A friend of mine has acquired some 300/1200 baud modems built by
Western Electric.  I have been trying to help interface the
modem to his personal computer.  I can't even figure out where
to connect the telephone line.

The modem is 2 inches high by 6 wide by 11 deep.  It has 5
push-push type switches on the front and a number of indicators
behind the red plastic faceplate.  It says "Dataphone 300/1200" on
the front faceplate plus the Bell symbol.  On a label on the bottom,
it says "Data Set 212A, AR Options" and has a chart showing internal
DIP switch settings for various options.  Another label says:
"4702 Data Mounting
P/O Data Set 212A OR AR Type
Series 1   81 MG 02"

There are two 25-pin data connectors on the rear, one male and one female.
I cannot see any place to connect the phone line anywhere, inside or out.

If anyone could furnish the necessary
interfacing information I would certainly be indebted.  I am hoping that
I can talk my friend into giving me one of these modems so I am especially
anxious to be helpful.

Subject:  Z80 Plus Board by Applied Engineering

     Does anybody out there know anything about the Z-80 Plus 
board from Applied Engineering in Dallas Texas?  I want to use it 
in an Apple IIe that now has a Grappler+ hooked up to an Epson 
FX80 printer.  My IIe also has the single Apple disk controller 
board and the extended-memory 80 column card from Apple.  Future 
plans include a modem card or a serial I/O card hooked up to an 
external modem.

     What's the catch?  This card sounds so good, but it's really 
cheap at $140.  It claims to be compatible with Microsoft CPM disks.  
Will it boot directly from the Microsoft Softcard operating 
system?  Does CPM come with the Z80 Plus?  Will it handle CPM 
3.0?  Are there any known problems with other boards, such as 
serials, modems, disk emulators, etc?  Does it really run Wordstar, 
dBase II, etc, as the ads claim?

     It just sounds too good to be true.  What's the story?  Any 
help, soon, would be appreciated.

                              -Tom Minor

	I can't talk to the question you posed directly, however I
just had a bout with a the ALS Z-card that may be worth considering.
The Z-card ($129) was purchased mail-order so that I could run wordstar
and do some work for downline loading to another z-80 computer.
I also had Microsoft's Ramcard.
	To make a long story short, the z-card came with cpm and several
utilities.  Most of the utilities didnt bomb, but didnt work either.
The 60K system generation utility failed to produce a bootable CPM
system.  After a long delay and several long distance phone calls to the
mail-order firm, ALS finally got back to us saying that there was a 
"timing problem between the z-card and microsoft's ramcard."  After
two iterations of this, I gave up and got microsoft's cpm and card
which was up and running a 60k system in 15 minutes.
	Cheapness doesnt always pay off - either in time or money.

I tried to change the phone directory in mdm724.com using m7lib.com.
m7lib finds and displays the directory in the mdm724 program and then
asks if it looks all right.  No matter what I answer to this question
(yes, no, <C>hange, etc.) I get the message:

What am I doing wrong (besides following the instructions in the m7lib.doc file)?

Subject:  ZCPR3 Status

        For those of you who are  interested,  I'll  probably  be
sending  out  a  status  report  on  the development of the ZCPR3
System sometime over the next few days.   The  system  is  coming
along  quite  nicely,  with  the  ZCPR3 Command Processor running
without error and the three supporting libraries, SYSLIB 3, VLIB,
and  Z3LIB, almost complete.  I expect all of the ZCPR3 utilities
to come up very quickly after I polish off Z3LIB, which is  still
under major development.

        I'll be giving two talks over the next two months on  the
topic  of  ZCPR3  if  you are interested in attending.  The first
talk is later today at the SIG/M meeting.  The talk will be given
in  the  Health  Building at Union County College, Scotch Plains,
NJ, starting around 8PM tonight (Friday, Mar 2).

        The second talk will be given  at  the  Trenton  Computer
Festival  on  Saturday,  April 14.  It is currently scheduled for
11:00 AM.  Details on the room will be available in the  Festival
program.   I'm hoping to include a live demonstration during this
talk, but there are no guarantees at this time.

        Sometime during later  March  or  early  April,  I'll  be
bringing  a  ZCPR3  system designed for remote access online on a
limited-time basis for those who are interested in spending  some
money  on  a  phone  call  and  trying out ZCPR3 in real-time and
exploring what it can do.  More details on this when  the  system
comes up.

        I'm still not willing to pinpoint a date for the  release
of  ZCPR3, but I strongly suspect that it will go out sometime in
the next three months.  Will let you know when it happens.

I have the sources for edit 4.21 of the C-language RBBS4,
a CP/M-based bulletin board system. Compiles with version
1.5 or later of BDS C.

It is huge - 111,111 bytes. I think this makes it too big
to post, or to mail to large numbers of people. If you want
the software, send me *mail* (do NOT post your reply to
the net or to "notesfiles", but use MAIL to reply).
Once I have an estimate of how many people want it
on USENET, I will figure out how best to distribute it.

Arpa/Milnet users can get it directly from simtel20.

Subject: WordStar and Daisy M-50, help needed
Article-I.D.: dutesta.210

Is there anyone who has installed a Daisy M-50 daisy wheel printer
in WordStar (version 3.0).

I know the Daisy M-45 has to be installed as either a Diablo 1610/1620
or as a Qume sprint 5 printer. A M-50 however doesn't work well than.

I first installed it as a Sprint 5 printer and found that every second
line got printed backwards. This was resolved by putting a .bp off in the
file (is there an instalation option to do this?). Than I found out that
as long as WordStar didn't fill the lines everything went fine. As soon
as WordStar started to fill lines (and micro justify them) printing went
wrong. It prints about one line (unreadable) and than the printer starts
to flash its RST light indicating wrong control code's.

Installing it as any other daisy wheel does not solve the problems.

Is there anyone who has a clue as to wat might be wrong ?

Please mail to the following addres:

    Sb: #Kaypro Mystery Solved
        18-Jan-84  01:54:26
    Fm: JACK CRENSHAW 72325,1327
    To: All

    Some time ago I reported a problem with the MDM711/Kaypro/Epson combina-
    tion, in that the ^P print buffer dropped characters.  Periodically, the
    subject has come up again, with Irv Hoff and Pete Holsberg trying hardest

    to help me solve the problem.  I finally got around to looking at the
    Kaypro BIOS, and as Pete suspected, there's a bug. The offending piece
    of code is in the ROM, and goes:

         LISTST:  IN     1CH    	;GET SYSTEM PORT
                  BIT    3,A   	;TEST PRINTER READY BIT
                  RZ        	;THIS IS THE BUG
                  MVI    A, 0FFH	;ELSE RETURN FF
                  RET

    Note that if the bit 3 is zero, the routine returns garbage in A. The
    garbage is whatever is in port 1CH, which includes output as well as
    input bits.  However, the zero FLAG is set properly, which is why BIOS
    function 4 (LIST) works OK.  Ironically, if the programmer had used the
    usual ANI insruction instead of the Z-80 fancy bit test, he would have
    saved two bytes as well as get the right response.  The bug is in the
    ROM, so can't be easily fixed. The patch is easy, though -  Change the
    jump vector in the BIOS to:   JMP PATCH   and add:

         PATCH:  CALL    0FB65H	;call old bios entry
                 RNZ		;OK unless its zero
                 XRA     A		;else clear A
                 RET		;that's all, folks

The Applicards will not run the Microsoft Softcard version of

probably due to the separate memory on the AppliCard.

you can wait a couple of days, I'll have RBBS 4.1 Edit 00 (or 01)
ready for release.  This version has two significant changes or

Apologies to those on info-mac also.

Kaypro IV 1984 model now available.  Neat.  4 mhz z-80, built-in
modem,  nice screen, character set from the 10 (clean and nice),
2 serial and one centronics ports.

Still no 8" disk connector (but there's an after market source)
for that as well as for an external video connector).

Usual ton of software: Perfect everything, WordStar, Microsoft
Basic, CBASIC, SBASIC (compiled structured; not bad if a bit
obscure syntax at times; true local variables, etc.) Chang Labs
spreadsheet. Costs more than the older IV, but in my judgment
worth it.  Good beginning writer's machine.

In-reply-to: Msg of Sat 3 Mar 84 13:35:54-EST from Mark Becker <CENT.MBECK%MIT-OZ at MIT-MC.ARPA>

The MDM724.HEX file on SIMTEL20 and MIT-MC was generated with
UNLOAD.COM from MDM724.COM which was "loaded" with MLOAD14.COM.

Reasons:
The hex file produced by ASM (or most any other CP/M assembler) is
full of "holes" where "DS" statements occur in the source code.  When
you use DR's LOAD.COM to make a .COM file from this, you get "garbage"
from memory in these areas and the result is that the CRC of the .COM
file will not match the distributed version of the .COM file which was
made with MLOAD14 (MLOAD14 puts all zeros into DS areas).  So, to
assure that everyone would have the same .COM file as the one on
SIMTEL20 and MIT-MC, I uploaded the UNLOADed one, not the one from the
assembler.

Perfect Printer skips a line when using superscripts.  This looks pretty bad

Subject: looking for programs written in CBASIC
Article-I.D.: lzmi.189

[this space available]
I have just gotten the CBASIC compiler for my micro, and am looking
for source, or pointers to source, for any public-domain CBASIC programs
that might be available. I will accept pointers to source programs
written for the CBASIC interpreter, as the conversion from one to the
other is trivial. I will also take pointers to any BBS that may
contain what I am after.

Please reply directly by mail, or call at (201)576-2711.
Thanks in advance.......Rob Coben

NetLandians,

MDM724, as downloaded in .ASM form from SIMTEL20 MICRO:<CPM.MDM7>, works
perfectly.  (I expected no less!)  I used the old original overlay for my
Morrow Decision I (not the easiest computer to interface with port I/O),
and it meshed right in.  (Good idea, that constancy with the same overlays.)

I added one wee little thing for you people trying to work via micro and MDM7xx
through a TAC.  As you know, the TAC has an Intercept Character (mine uses the
@ sign), and it WILL choke up during normal uploads unless special precau-
tions are taken (change the intercept sign to something unused, turn it OFF!,
etc.).  I got a simpler fix, and it takes about a couple dozen bytes.

At the two parts in MDM where it gets ready to send a character out as part of
a file upload (T mode and S mode), simply check the character to be sent.
If it's your intercept character...send it twice!  I'll be pushing up a more
thorough patch in a couple of days that'll add a toggle to your MDM menu, so
you can turn the character on and off, or change as needed.  (Don't want to be
sending two @'s to your local CBBS!)

Exact locations for the simple quick-fix are:


SEND80C:.....
SENDCH1: PUSH D
         CALL SPEED
         POP D
         MOV A,M
         CPI EOFCHAR
         RZ
***Here's where to put the little patch:
         CPI '@'		;is it the Intercept Char?
         CZ MODOUT	;yup, let the MODOUT segment do its thing.

...and fall right through to the rest of the stuff.
The only thing cut out is SPEED, but you shouldn't need that just to
reach to the TAC.

That takes care of a Terminal T mode send; now for the error-trapping
send (S)...
Way down, find...
MONOUT: ....
NOMONOUT:POP PSW	;doing this 'cause the char involved is in A
         PUSH PSW

*** Here's where we put the TAC Trap...

        CPI '@'		;is it the Intercept char?
        JNZ SENDW		;nope, skip this mess
TRAP:   CALL SENDRDY	;we have to check for modem ready too.
        JNZ TRAP	;we're in effect duplicating all in SENDW since we
        POP PSW    	;can't call SENDW to do the work for us.
        PUSH PSW	;gotta put it back where SENDW expects to POP it.
        CALL OUT$MODDATP	;send the @ out the first time...
				;...and fall through to
SENDW:  CALL SENDRDY		;...send it the second time.
        JNZ SENDW
        POP PSW
        JMP OUT$MODDATP

Here's an actual demo -- I fired it right up into XED on my host through
my TAC here at Ft Bragg.  Engaged F I S (flow control in the TAC so it'll
XON/XOFF MDM724 immediately and not overflow the TAC keyboard buffer).
As you can see, the @'s made it just fine.  Watching it on the screen
as it uploaded, I could see 2, 4, 6, and 8 @'s upload.

This is to test out the World Famous Toad Hall TAC Trap newly installed
in MDM724.COM.

I sent this message once befor and got no response, so I'll try again.

I am using Link-80 3.44 09-Dec-81.  It appears that L80 does a disk
reset and relogs the disk every time it accesses a new REL file.  This
becomes very time consuming when you have a hard disk with a large
directory since it must regenerate the allocation map every time it
resets the disk.

Is there a patch to modify this behavior?  It seems that all the disk
relogging is unnecessary and could be patched out.

The Kaypro 4-84 (new model with built-in modem and clock) uses
different boot-rom code from both the Kaypro II and old Kaypro 4.
Each had a somewhat different bug in handling the bios list-status

We (Plu*Perfect Systems) recently wrote the foreign-language versions of
the bios for this machine for Kaypro and corrected the boot-rom.
The change is supposed to go into the domestic machines too, but I

Subject: Alignment of disk drives with DDD (Dysan Diagnostic Disk)
From: meier%isl@AMSAA.ARPA

X
	I am trying to use DDD version 1.1 and Dysan Diagnostic Disk
to align a pair of Shugart 800 disk drives with a Disk Jockey 2D Controller.
I think that I have set the constants in DDD appropriately and I have been
able to adjust the disks so that they pass the DDD tests, but there has been
no noticeable improvement in the performance.  I have been unsuccessful
thus far, but I suspect that the major problem is that I don't understand
the readings that I am getting from DDD.  In particular, what are reasonable
readings when doing the centering test.  The current symptoms are that I get
a BAD SECTOR error about once every 12 hours with single density and with
double density, the surface of the disk inside the about track 10 is all
BAD SECTORS.  I would appreciate any help or suggestions that anyone is
willing to offer.

Subject:  Bugs in Turbo Pascal

	I am generally pleased with Turbo Pascal, especially its fast
compilation, but I have found two compiler bugs, both of which had 
easy work arounds.  The first is that it wold not accept the declaration
of a particular text file variable until I moved it to a non-standard
place ahead of the TYPE declarations (which is a legal extension to
Turbo Pascal).  It accepts other similar declarations in other programs, so
the exact cause of the bug is unknown.  (It would not accept it when
simply moved to a different place among the VAR declarations--I did not
try all possible such places!)

 	The second cost me a lot of time finding. Don't:

Type  Junk = record
	...
	Name : Array [1..3] of Char;
	...
	End;

Var   Iron : Junk;
	.
	.
	.
  Iron.Name := 'met';

Iron.Name containis random garbage.  The work-around is:

Type as above
	.
	.
var temp : Array [1..3] of char;
	.
	.
  temp := 'met';
  Iron.Name := temp;

Iron.Name is now 'met' as was intended.

I don't have time to go poking around in Jenkins and Wirth to be sure
what is legal, but if the code isn't legal, the compiler should give 
a syntax error message instead of being silent as the grave.

Subject:  Re:  Bugs in Turbo Pascal


You might want to point out to Mr. Kahn that there is a serious bug in
his advertising - nowhere does it indicate that his 8 bit Turbo Pascal
is written in Z80 code rather than 8080. It would certainly be a logical
assumption that if unspecified, it is indeed 8080, since it is advertised
to run under CP/M-80.
Another foolishness that irks me (unrelated to the above issue) is that
it seems to be getting more and more difficult to determine
exactly what machine an advertised package is targeted to. This seems
particularly rampant among the vendors of Apple software. The implicit
assumption that the target machine is clearly the only machine worth
writing software for is ridiculous. How difficult would it be to
specify in a single sentence what micro the software is designed for,
as well as operating system, ram, and I/O requirements?

You certain that an alignment problem exists?  Do the drives perform the
same warm as they do cold?  Morrow's data seperator on my controller 
like most designs of two to three years ago-- uses a digital phase
detector which is temperature dependent to a very high degree.  This
information comes from the close analysis of a friend doing circuit
design for Western Digital.   Also, which DJ2D are you running?  The
memory mapped version, the I/O mapped version *without* DMA, or the I/O
version *with* DMA.  Many of the non-DMA, I/O mapped controllers had
layout errors on the board which were corrected via cut & jumper; my own
had, I believe, six jumpers, but one pair of cuts had been left out.
They turned out to be the triggers to the one-shots controlling the
write-gate window for write pre-comp.  Failure to make those cuts
eventually cost me the 1791 controller.  (Note that this board was
purchased as-is with my full knowledge that design problems could exist.
Very few if any of these were, to my understanding, sold without such
information provided.  Morrow enjoys my high regard.)  My friend from
Western Digital found the missing cuts & things seem to have settled
down considerably.

Borland's got some surprising company with their product description
problem.  Read on.

Flame #1:

I have been trying to get information on what CCP/M is and is not, what
it takes to port the same, & what a couple of particular ports are and
do.  DRI has not, after no fewer than four requests, responded with so
much as advertising copy, let alone literature useful to an integrator.
I can't buy their manuals anymore, so how am I supposed to evaluate the
product's usefulness to me?  Other vendors supply reasonable product
information (sometimes gratis), what's the lever that works on DRI?

Flame #2:

Octagon Systems advertises what appears to be the most viable
alternative to bank-breaking investments in Compupro equipment since the
invention of the dual processor.  Wonderful published specs.  Can I get
a demo from Priority One, who offers Ocatgon stuff?  "Nope, no demo
system available."  Can I buy the manual advertised in their catalog.
"Nope, all out."  Can I get definitive literature from Octagon (i. e., a
written commitment on what their system is/is not, etc., or failing
that, at least a complete description of capabilities).  "Yes, sir.
We'll send it out today."  That was three weeks ago & it ain't here yet,
after the second request.  I have had good dealings with Priority One,
and must assume they're in the same fix.  I conclude (sic) that either
Octagon products are mythical as the unicorn, the best thing since
sliced bread & therefore sell faster than made, or so full of bugs
they're not really in production, despite the glossy advertising.
Anybody on this net know these guys?

Last Flame:

We have all heard Good Things about Gifford & their software for
Compupro stuff.  I tried calling the L. A. Gifford number for literature
on their software & got lots of soft sell, a long converstion on "my
needs", and no literature.  What have they really done to/for MP/M-86
(if I could find out what it is in the first place)?  What is the party
line on what is required to run their port of the same?  What are the
options?  My advice, if you live in L. A., is don't ask unless you have
lotsa dollars to find out.

If their is a common thread in any of the above, it is that many
companies out there on the edge look flaky.  Octagon, Giiford, & DRI may
all have cases of oversupply-of-demand, but all at once, and for four
(count 'em) months?  They may indeed have competent products produced by
good people, but from the point of view of a little-guy end user, who
could tell?  Anybody out there got a fomula  magic or otherwise  for
making the determination?  I have to live with expensive decisions on
these guys for a long time.

	I am placing this message on the net instead of direct in the event that
is of public interest.

MMoon.es,
	Thank you for responding.  I am not certain that the problem is one of
alignment, this was my best guess at the problem.  In response to your questions:

	o The performance is not noticably dependent on whether the drives are
		warm or cold
	o The DJ2D board is memory mapped and is engaged by subroutine calls to
		an onboard prom (E000-FFFF)

	The major factor affecting performance is whether single density or
double density is being used.  There are far fewer bad sectors at single density
than at double density.  Unfortunately, the CP/M with the DJ2D will not fit on
the first two tracks in single density.

DRI Concurrent exists for PC, and is pretty damned good.  I
think probably wave of the future.

About Octogon I know nothing.

Gifford MP/M is said to work; Jim Hudson is using it.  I am
using CP/M 8/16 because it is faster and I have Tony Pietsch's
new TMX Bios for it.  8/16 with Compupro hard disk is just plain
GREAT, if you're willing to put up with some of CP/M's quirks.
Alas, some of these are quirks I am not used to because Tony
used to trap them in the BIOS and you can't do that in 8/16.
However, Compupro has bouth the source to CP/M and is
contemplating doing a few nice things to the Command Processor
to make it a little friendlier; but that's a Real Soon Now
project, and I have no clues as to when it will be available, or
even that they won't shelve it for another project; 
	I expect to have Concurrent running on my big system
Real Soon Now.  It runs on the IBM PC fine.

Intel has apparently become an OEM for DR CP/M software.
They support CP/M on their development systems and many
of the manuals can be purchased at your local Intel rep.
I bought the M80/L80 and BASIC-80 compiler manuals from
the Detroit Intel rep for a client who wanted to evaluate
those packages.  The books have an Intel cover and Intel
order number, but are identical to the ones supplied by
DR with those packages.

suffering from growing pains, but I have a high regard for them and their
technical capabilities and their heart is in the right place.

Bear in mind that as hackers, we are not likely to get the inside dope
from Giffoed when it comes to explaining the innards of MP/M-816. This
company is not dedicated to serving hackers, rather their expertise lies in
dealing with less technical people who want to get the job done and are
not interested in the inner workings of the operating system. I wish
this were different, but I certainly see their point and can respect

You mentioned a bug in "UNPACK".  Are you talking about SQUEEZE

the problem is in SQ.COM if you have a version before 1.5.  The
problem was that the SQueezer overflowed the 16-bit counter used
during the packing process.  This happened only occasionally and
with only certain types of files.  The latest versions for SQ

After you overlay MDM727.COM using DEBUG, patch the following

This will disable the CP/M disk stat call function 1Fh which is

To: info-cpm@MIT-MC.ARPA

On the reality and availability of Octagon hardware:

	We in the Rutgers Microcomputer Lab had been looking for a big
hard disk system for one of our bulletin board RCP/M computers for
many moons.  We too were attracted by the glossy advertisements from
Octagon promising a complete 16Mb hard disk subsystem with BIOS for a
reasonable price.  My first call to Octagon got me copies of the
technical manuals for everything they make!  I only asked about the
hard disk subsystem for a Z80 but I got specs on their 8/16 dual
processor board and assembly listings for both their 8080 and 8088
BIOS'.  They were friendly and helpful on the phone and were at CP/M
83 (a big trade show) with some of their equipment.  After consulting
with the person who wrote their BIOS to make sure it would suit our
purpose, we ordered one.

	The Octagon Hard disk subsystem arrived in a reasonable time
but showed signs of being an early product.  The packaging was not
great.  There were no physical assembly instructions; I had to call
them to find out which cable went where and which orientation was
right for the plugs.

	There was documentation on how to install the software and
after we had followed it to the letter three or four times without
success, I called Octagon again.  They were helpful but were unable to
solve the problem over the phone.  The gentleman who wrote their BIOS
asked me to send back to whole thing and include a listing of our
original floppy BIOS (to which his was supposed to attach but didn't).
We sent the whole kit and kaboodle back to Octagon and waited.

	About a week later (rather reasonable turnaround actually) I
got a DHL courier express package with the whole subsystem in it.  It
seems our BIOS does things a little differently than Octagon had
assumed (don't they all) and their attach BIOS would not work.  They
had >rewritten< their BIOS for us and would we please test it and tell
them how it went.  I for one was surprised and pleased when we hooked
it all back up and it WORKED!  We had been playing with it for so long
without luck the first time that we were just dying to see that little
"In-use" LED light up.  Some more extended playing with the system
exposed another problem, files would disappear from the hard disk or
would fail to PIP properly.  Octagon suggested reformatting the disk
and trying again.

	Formatting the disk revealed several areas of the disk that
would not format correctly.  We suspected a bad disk until we tried
formatting the disk when the system was cold.  It seemed to format OK
cold but if the system had been on for a while, it failed.  Octagon
customer support thought it was probably a failing heat-sensitive
component on the hard disk controller board (a reasonable assumption).
They express-shipped us one the next day.  After trying the new board
and getting identical results, another call to Octagon got us a new
drive unit, again shipped overnight at no charge to us.  Exchanging
the drive has fixed the last problem and we are now revelling in the
speeds of Wordstar and Mince on hard disk.

	 The whole system has been running for about a week now with
no new problems and we are very satisfied with it.  It is small, it is
fast and it works.

	Overall, I got these impressions of Octagon:

1) Yes, its a rather new product.  But, it definitely exists. They
said on the phone that they had about 25 of them successfully running
in Z80 systems.

2) They are a young company that has not reached the point of user
unfriendliness we hear about DRI or Micropro.  They are willing to help
and to spend their time and effort to get things solved.  I could
expect no better.  I personally would rather deal with a smaller
company even if it did make mistakes occasionally, than with a monster
like IBM or DEC. (which by the way have also been rumored to have made
mistakes).  

3) Anytime we had a problem, they acted responsibly and quickly to
attempt to solve it and, although we did have an unusual number of
them in installing this system, I am generally pleased by the company
and the product.

Reading through Seymour Joseph's experience with his new Octagon Hard Disk
and controller prompted me to offer this tidbit of info to techies and non-
techies alike.

I personally have an unreasonable fear of sending my S100 boards back for
repair.  This especially holds true for temperature sensitive problems.
If you are experiencing intermittent problems there are a few things you can try before packin' it up an' sendin' it off to who knows where for who knows
how long.  If you suspect heat is the problem take a hair dryer and fit the
hose (please don't use a floor model) with a small diameter plastic tube
using tape or whatever.  Let your board cool down.  Then systematically direct
the heat from the hair dryer to each individual chip on the board.  You can
actually heat them to the point that they are too hot to touch and they should
still purr without incident.  If there is a bad chip on the board that's
thermal sensitive you'll find it.

Incidently, heat is not the only way that chips (or transistors) will fail.
Cold can also be the cause of failure.  At present I am using a pressurized
can of freon (tape cleaner) to cool circuits.  It runs down the board and
gives you the impression that it will fry every living circuit on your board,
but it is non conductive and does no harm.  A better alternative would be to
purchase a product called "circuit cooler" which will actually put frost on
your precious electronic gizmos but again, no harm should be done.
Please "DON'T USE COLD WATER OR ANY THING THAT MIGHT BE CONDUCTIVE."  If in
doubt don't use it.

One last thing that you might try is tapping on each chip or banging on the edge of the board to check for poor mechanical connections, solder balls and bad
chip seating in sockets.  Don't use instruments made of metal for the "tap
test" as a poorly placed strike could put you out of business for certain.

If you wish, you may purchase commercial products at your local electronics
supply house to make it all a bit more professional.  I have a heater specifi-
cally design to heat electronic components.  And if your board(s) are burried
deep inside a mainframe then it might also pay to purchase a board extender.
Be careful with these because you now have no protection from inserting the
board backwards in the extender.

You don't need technical know-how to perform any of the above.  If you localize
the problem then a component is what it costs (probably cheaper than shipping
your board off "UPS Blue") and your board never leaves your side.

I get queasy (or is it withdrawal) when I'm without mine.

Happy troubleshooting.

Subject: QK12 bug fix
To: INFO-CPM@AMSAA.ARPA

The following bug fix for Quikkey version 1.2 was obtained from
a file on CompuServe.  I assume it's from the author of the program.
---
	There is a minor bug in QK12.ASM, of interest only to those who
employ USER sections.  When you are done setting up the initiating and 
terminating keys, QK12 returns you to current drive, user 0 rather than
current drive, current user.

	The fix is quite simple:  there are three lines preceding the
label "rwccp:", as shown:

	lda	cusrdrv
	ani	0fh
	mov	c,a
rwccp:
	jmp	?


The "0fh" should be changed to "0ffh" to preserve both current drive and
current user.

	You can also patch the COM file by using DU.  Find the first
allocation block of QK12.COM and G to there.  Then, =<E6><0F> will point
you at the op code for "mov c,a".  This was byte 64 on my system, and
byte 63 is the offender.  Do a CH63,FF;W;X  and you're in business
without having to reassemble the ASM file.

	Please let me know if yoy run into a problem caused by this fix;
I admit that I did not research it thoroughly.  However, I've implemented
it and have had no problems.

DUU and DU2 (with more features) are indeed excellent disk editors.
There is however one slight problem when dealing with disks with bad

return the data to DUU or DU2 if one is detected.  This leaves the
contents of the previous read in DUU's buffer.  I wrote quick and
dirty DDT routines to turn off error detection while attemting to
repair bad sectors  and then reenable error detection when I'm done.

NEVER!  "That's NEVER EVER try fixing a bad track by doing:
read..  write.. increment.. loop.    Fix those nasty little sectors

The error handling/reporting by those programs "should" abort loops and
return error messages to the user.

Subject:  Turbo Pascal delays

Hi,

I called Borland yesterday to find out what had happened to my copy of
Turbo Pascal.  It had been several weeks since I ordered it over the
phone (using the advertised 800 number), and I hadn't been billed on
my latest Visa statement.  The woman at the 800 number told me to call
Customer Support (I don't have their number on me right now) and the
woman there was VERY helpful and friendly.  She checked the records
for the day that I originally placed my order and said that she
couldn't find my order.  She told me the usual story: they are swamped
with orders, they send them out every day, and the people who take the
orders have been losing them (I was apparently not the first).  I then
placed a new order with her and she assured me that I will receive it
within 2 weeks.  The point of this story is: if you ordered Turbo Pascal
and haven't received it yet, try giving Customer Support a call.

        In trying to move some files from the ECLB TOPS-20
system, I have encountered two problems:

                1. Persistent aborts after 60-100 records (but
always at the same record) in CRC mode

                2. Consistent abort for "Bad Header" at record
255 in checksum mode (which suggests to me that modem is not
rolling over beyond 0FFH).

        On the receiving end, have been using an Osborne 1
running MDM791, and an H-89 using MODEM901, both at 300 baud.
Problem occurs in same place on both.  Files were being sent with
binary output set on TOPS-20.

        Has anyone else encountered this?  I didn't until two
days ago; has anything changed?

Subject: Using cold-in-a-can products to isolate faults

You should be careful when using one of those cold-in-a-can products
to isolate heat-sensitive chips.  Apparently someone took a look at
these things and discovered that suddenly cooling down a hot chip can
cause it to fail.  This is not entirely suprising when you consider what
happens when you put a hot glass jar into cold water; it cracks.  I
don't know if this person came up with actual figures for these cold-
induced failures, but if you notice your board fails in a different way
after cooling down a chip it may be that you now have TWO defective chips.

Jesse,
	DUU and DU2 are probably what I can use.  How can I get a copy of them?
My BIOS also traps bad sector errors, but at least it would prevent me from losing
all the information on a disk.  It would allow me to mark the sectors as bad
in the directory.  (and thus prevent cp/m from trying to use them)

The linker "L80.COM" from Microsoft behaves in way that can be annoying.
L80 does a disk reset and relogs the disk every time it accesses a new
.REL file.  This was done so that .REL files from several disks could be
linked simply by inserting the proper disk before entering the name of
the .REL file.  All the relogging avoided the dreaded BDOS ERROR: R/O
that comes from indiscriminately swapping disks.

If you never swap disks, then this behavior just increases the link
time.  This relogging becomes very time consuming when you have a hard
disk with a large directory since CP/M must regenerate the allocation
map every time it resets the disk.  The following patch will eliminate
the unnecessary relogging.

This patch is for Link-80 3.44 09-Dec-81.

The patch causes a jump around the disk relogging calls.  The version
number is also changed to 3.441.

If you have been linking files on a hard disk you will be pleased by the
marked increase in speed.  I have not had any problems linking files
using the patched version of L80.  Remember that you cannot swap disks
while you are running the modified version of L80.

The problem may not be hardware.  My Kaypro used to run the drive 
motors until a character was read or written to console, I don't
remember which.  For instance Perfect Writer would start them spinning
when it swapped and they would stay on till I typed something.  Then
last spring or so our user group got an updated CP/M and-- voila--
the drives turned off after use.

So-- find someone with a newer Kaypro, and have them format/sysgen
a disk for you.  (Have them copy the whole CP/M disk-- some of the 
utilities have improved a bunch.)  Maybe it will work, maybe not,
but it's worth a try.

(If you don't find someone handier, contact me and I'll mail you
a disk).

communication program designed to facilitate the transfer of
files between Unix and CP/M systems via MODEM7) that will run under
4.1bsd. Ideally, I'd like to obtain copies for both VAX 11/780s and

one or the other machine.  I would be grateful for any information you

[]
	I had exactly same experience with Digital Research and Octagon.
After waiting for several weeks for Octagon's literature, I finally
managed to talk to a person in their tech department.  (My questions
were: is the 8" DD disk format IBM (i.e. CompuPro) compatible? -- Yes.
Will the CPU's work with 4Mhz static memory mapped board? -- Maybe.)
Mike Lucas from Priority 1 said they had Octagon's board running in 
a CompuPro system and it did fine.  Priority had sold several to large 
companies in LA area and had no complaints.  I then ordered one from
Priority 1 (in mid February).  It is supposed to be shipped around 
March 10.  Presumably, I am taking a risk.  But I was surprised and
very disappointed by CompuPro's decision to obsolete their Z-80 CPU
by introducing a dual CPU board running 8080 only.  I considered
getting their new Z80 slave CPU but was told that delivery will not
start until summer (also, the price is about $1000).
	For those haven't heard about Octagon's 8/16 CPU board, here
are a few specs (as advertised):
	-- dual CPU's (8088 at 8MHz and NSC-800 at 4MHz.  NSC chip 
	is upward compatible with Z80 at the machine language level.)
	-- FDC on board, up to 4 5" or 8" drives in any combination.
	-- two software controlled serial ports on board <= 19000 bps
	-- monitor in PROM, fixed freq timer interrupt, etc.
The current Priority 1 price is $795.  For another $695 they will
sell you 128K of CompuPro's fast RAM, and that is ALL you need to
run Octagon's system (CP/M-86 will run with 64K).  If it works as 
advertised, it is a steal.  I will likely have more to say when I 
get the board.

We had exactly the same problem with uc.c on 4.1 - what you have to do
to fix it is change the fstat procedure name to something else - for
example, myfstat, as it is overlaying the system fstat in the io
library, and the first printf in the program is causing infinite
recursion until you blow the stack.

Be aware that the uc.c program will fail as soon as you go to 4.2 - it
uses alarm() to time out reads, and the entire signal handling mechanism
has changed in 4.2 in this respect, so you'll have to rewrite all the
sections of code that depend on that.  Look into the 'select' system
call in your 4.2 manuals.

A few days ago I posted 'xmodem' - a sort of umodem program updated for
4.2 BSD.  You'll find a working example of the select call and timeout
as it would be used in uc in that program.  Or you could add crcs to
xmodem - I intended to but ran out of time.

DUU and DU are at SIMTEL20 via anonymous FTP (I think DUU is in the SIGM
files somewhere, and DU under disk utilities).  FINDBAD, which is supposed to
find and lock out bad sectors (by storing them in a file called BAD or
something like that) is also out there -- however I find it does not catch
all the errors, since I can run FINDBAD and still get BDOS errors. Donno
why.

If you need help FTPing from SIMTEL20, yell.

Subject:  Looking For A BASIC Interpreter For The 68K

	I am looking for a good BASIC interpreter for the 68000
processor.  I want somthing which runs under CP/M-68K or standalone.
It should be fairly compatable with Microsoft BASIC. Microsoft BASIC
is the BASIC which is the basis of the BASIC-IN-ROM in most of the
"little" machines:  Apple I&II, Atari, Commodore, TI, TRS-80, etc.
It does not have to be super fast - I will be using for educational
purposes running little student programs.  I have a SAGE II w/ two
5.25" DSQD disks (640Kbytes eash), with both the UCSD p-System and
CP/M-68K O/S's.  The BASIC compiler that comes with UCSD p-System is
very non-compatable and a pain to use.  I want something better.

As pointed out elsewhere, it is probably NOT a good idea to do

READs each sector and cannot detect and flag WRITE errors.

Has this always been the case?  In my Kaypro (one of the first horizontal
drive models the light is on if the drive is selected, whether or not the
drive is running, but the motor shuts off after a certain time with no
further access.  If this motor running at all times is new, you could call
up the dealer and see if it can be fixed cheap, otherwise Kaypro will sell
you a whole new board for $120.  If the A motor running all the time is
inherent in your old model Kaypro, it could be solved with a more up to
date BIOS or a commercial replacement such as KayKey, which allows you to
set when the drive motor shuts off.  Call up Kaypro and ask.  I've found
them to be very responsive.  Within Perfect Writer the motor runs after the
last access for ever if you don't hit a key, but that doesn't sound like
your problem.  Maybe some more technical people can give more specific

John,

The MODEM communcation programs are periodically copied down from
the SIMTEL20 MICRO<UNIX.[CPM,MENU,UTILS1] directories. You will find
test versions of the UMODEM, UC, and TMODEM programs in /usr/local on
all the general user UCB CFO Vax Unix systems (including ucbpopuli and
ucbtopaz). For manual pages use the "-l" option of man, for example:
"man -l umodem".

The SIMTEL20 has now been up for over 50 continuous hours after the
infamous shunt-trip circuit breaker was installed and acid-tested
(twice) earlier in the week, and the Air Conditioner load balanced so
that it doesn't shutdown.  We expect to remain up continuously except
for scheduled PM every other Wednesday morning.

The SIMTEL20 holds the online repository for the entire SIG/M and
CPMUG volumes of public domain disks.  We also actively maintain a
separate collection of current CP/M public domain software originally
started on MIT-MC.  There is also a fledgling collection of UNIX/C
public domain software from Rick Conn, with the DARCOM ToolChest to be
added momentarily.  We also expect to be uploading the current set of
42 PC-BLUE volumes next week, and the latest releases from SIG/M as
they become available.

The major directories of interest are:

MICRO:<CPM.*>		The constantly updated CP/M collection from MC
			See MICRO:<CPM>CPM.DIRLST for a short list of
			the subdirectory name to substitute for the *.

MICRO:<SIGM.VOLnnn>	The SIG/M collection, where nnn = 000 to 145.
			We are expecting 146 to 165 RSN.

MICRO:<CPMUG.VOLnnn>	The CPMUG collection, where nnn = 001 to 054,
			and 078 to 090 (055 to 077 are duplicates of
			various SIG/M volumes).

MICRO:<UNIX.*>		UNIX/C utilities from Rick Conn, including UC
			and MENU to name two.

MICRO:<UNIX.TOOLCHEST.*>The DARCOM ToolChest (available later today).

MICRO:<PC-BLUE.VOLnnn>	The SIG/M and NYACC PC-BLUE collection, where
			nnn = 001 to 042 (available later next week).

Each major directory also contains a file of the form,
MICRO:<dir>dir.CRCLST, which lists the contents of each of the
subdirectories in alphanumeric order along with the size, filetype,
and CRC value.

Filetype may be either ASCII or COM.  If COM, then it is an ITS Binary
file.  ALL of the files in MICRO:<SIGM.VOLnnn>, MICRO:<CPMUG.VOLnnn>,
and (soon) MICRO:<PC-BLUE.VOLnnn>, and the obviously binary files in
MICRO:<CPM.*> are stored in ITS Binary format to preserve published or
documented CRC values.

I am sending this to the net since my cry for help went that-a-way.
   The UFDC-1 controller (mine purchased from Compu/time) DOES
work with the Siemens FDD-221-5 80 track double-sided drive.  The
problem in my system came from relying on the controller documentation
when writing a customized BIOS.  BE ADVISED...Bit 5 of the control
byte to the controller should be a zero for side zero...NOT a one
for side zero as listed in the documentation.
   With the correct bit inserted, the board is FANTASTIC!  The
board is now configured with:
	Drive A - Tabor 3.25" - SS/DD - 12 mS steps - 384K
	Drive B - Siemens FDD-221-5 - DS/DD - 6 mS steps - 784K
	Drive C - Siemens FDD-100-8D - SS/DD - 6 mS steps - 636K
   With only a jumper change and drive swap, Drive B can change to
a Shugart SA-400 SS/DD - 20 mS steps - 160K.  A great controller
board...if only the documentation were correct.

Subject: BDOS 37 clarification
To: INFO-CPM@brl
cc: CSTROM@mit-mc

I received a clarification of the infamous BDOS 37 bug in CP/M 2.2 by
way of Compuserve's CP/M Interest Group. Following is the straight
poop (or so I am told)...

Fm: Jim Rosenberg 71515,124
To: All

Several months ago I left a message here about the bug in BDOS function 37.  I
see Jerry Pournelle is sounding off about it in this month's BYTE, and 
he's got his facts all mixed up. For those who missed my earlier message,
here's the story as I know it.
     There is definitely a bug in BDOS 37, which will get you into deep trouble
if you don't know about it, but if you use it carefully it seems to be
perfectly safe.  The problem comes when function 37 is used to reset the
current default disk.  Function 37 seems to do nothing but reset the correct
bits in the login vector.  Evidently BDOS simply assumes that the current
default disk CAN'T fail to be logged in, and when that happens it gets
extremely confused.  (Don't try to debug the results if you value your sanity!
I've seen open calls on a completely different disk report a file doesn't exist
even when it does, and the allocation map of the FCB is filled in by the open
call!!)  My experience is that function 37 is perfectly safe if you aren't
resetting the current disk. (I've only used it to reset one drive at a time.)
     The algorithm to reset an individual drive with the least pain is: (1) do
BDOS 25 to get the current disk.  If that isn't the drive you are resetting go
ahead and use BDOS 37.  (2)  Otherwise, get the login vector (BDOS 24) and see
if some drive other than what you want to reset is logged in.  If so, select
that drive, use BDOS 37, then select back to whatever drive had been current.
(3)  Only if neither of these obtains do you need to use BDOS 13.
     If anyone finds this doesn't work please let me know.  I've used this
algorithm in a piece of software of which I've sold hundreds all over the world
and it seems to work.  -Best, Jim
     P.S.  This is 2.2!!  Don't know if it also applies to CP/M-86.

Charlie Strom:
,
Thanks for the 3/10/84 net-msg on BDOS Function 37.  A couple of months
ago there was a lot of net traffic on this subject.
That triggered me to do some investigation.  Here is what
learned, in part from thoughtful messages from FJW, W8SDZ,
and some others, and in part from my own hacking:
,
    *   FJW provided the key by pointing out that Function 37 (F-37)
        does NOT reset the disk to which [DE] points,
        but rather disables the write-protect that
        normally prevents a write if the disk map on the
        disk does not match the disk map in memory.
,
    *   That leads to the logical conclusion that when
        one uses F-37, one must ALSO assure that the
        disk map in memory matches the actual disk.
,
    *   Through experimentation (switching disks and
        looking at the disk map in memory, which one
        can do using DDT or SID, and BDOS F-27) I found
        that every time a did a SEARCH FOR FIRST file
        (BDOS F-17) the disk map was reset.
,
    *   My conclusion (and I'd welcome criticism!) is
        that F-37 can be safely used to reset a specific
        disk so long as it is followed by a F-17 operation.
        Of course, any file on the disk being removed has to be
        closed first, to save the data.
,
    *   The disasters described by some seem to happen when
        one does a file write (or delete) after F-37 and
        a disk switch BUT before a disk map reset with
        F-17.
,
    *   Of course, that leaves the question of why use
        F-37 at all?  I don't if I don't have to -- I'm
        old enough to have become a devout coward who avoids
        needless risks.  But there are times when F-13 will
        not do the job.  Sometimes F-13 does undesirable things
        to the program you're in -- then there is not other way
        if a disk switch is needed.  Or is there?
,
    *   Hope this helps.  I'd welcome further analytical
        discussion.  I agree that Pournelle's current BYTE
        advice, though helpful in warning people, should have
        gone further than just say "don't do it".
,
Eric.

I recently got a Kaypro, and I need a terminal emulator for it.

Someone kindly pointed me to the files in
SIMTEL20: micro: <cpm>cpm.dirlst
                 <cpmug>cpmug.crclst
                 <sigm>sigm.crclst

I found some promising-looking files in micro:<sigm.vol141>
with names like KPROTERM.TXT and KAYMODEM.DOC, but upon reading
them here at MIT (fetched via FTP on my DEC 20) I found gibberish,
not human-legible text.

I've tried transferring files with names like FOO.TXT and FOO.DOC 
using ASCII, 8-BIT, and 36-BIT transfer modes, but I keep losing.
So I have three questions:

1) Is there a bootstrap program I can type into my Kaypro to make 
loading serious files easier?

2) Is there something I'm doing wrong with fetching stuff from SIMTEL20?

3) Can anyone recommend a terminal emulator program for Kaypros?
   (the free ADM3 that comes with Kaypros is too stupid. I'd prefer
    emulation of a VT52, Ann Arbor, Heath or other smarter terminal.)

Subject: MACRO-80 patch(es) ??
Cc: 


I have been told that the MACRO-80 sold by Heath is Microsoft's CP/M macro 
assembler, but that it will run only on Heath systems.  I have
also been told that there is a public domain patch which will permit it
to run on any CP/M system.  If there is such a patch, I would like to have
a copy of it. If the rest of the MACRO-80 system (i.e. the linker, etc.)
also requires similar patches, I would like copoes of those too.

I am considering buying a Fujitsu Micro16.  I can get a really
good price on one, but haven't heard much about them other
that it has an 8086, runs CP/M-86; MS-DOS; emulates straight
CP/M (somehow it makes the 8086 act like a Z-80) and will soon
offer a 68K and offer UNIX system V.

Can anyone out there give me some feed-back on it?

Thanks.

Subject: Vector 3 CP/M 2.22h CCP patching
To: info-cpm@BRL.ARPA

I have been working for some time on installing a RBBS based RCP/M
system on a Vector 3 system.  I have installed XMODEM and BYE and RBBS
and am just about ready to bring the whole thing up.  I am having
one last annoying problem though.  I usually install ZCPR on the
systems I use as RCP/Ms, to allow searching back to A0> mostly.  This
makes use of the system much more straightforward.   I don't like 
DUPUSR and this allows me to keep just one copy of the system 
software online in A0: and have it accessed from any drive or user#.
We have succesfully installed ZCPR in several other systems and have
never had a problem like this.  If anyone out there knows anything
that might help, please send me mail.  Here's the problem:  We install
ZCPR and SYSGEN a disk with it.  We cold boot and everything works
fine.  All the ZCPR commands work and the prompt has changed from A:
to A0: as it should.  The system searches back to A0: as advertised.
BUT, on the first cold boot (after a ^C or program exit) the system
tries to reload the CCP and crashes with a message that looks like
this:

-SYSTEM ERROR

As an alternative we got a patch that just implements the search back
to A0: instead of the full ZCPR and tried to install it.  We got the
exact same behavior from this patch.

Any Ideas?  What is so magic about the Vector CCP?  I have called
Vector several dozen times and they have proved to be much less than
useful. I am stumped and turn to you, the DARPA CP/M wizards to give
me a helping hand.

      Probably (looking at the front of the modem) pins 9 and 8 on the
RIGHT HAND 25 pin connector (facing the back) are the local loop (telephone
line). In addition, you will need a switch connected from 5 to 25 which
engages the modem after you have accessed the remote modem (originate
mode); or enables answer mode.

      The other one is usual RS232

Subject: CPM 3.0 (+) RCP/M info/help wanted
To: info-cpm@brl

I am interested in putting up an RCP/M on an Osborne Executive which runs CP/M
3.0.  I have been working with some people on getting BYE working, but, in
the all holy wisdom of OCC, which seems to be spread liberally on all their
products, it seems that the SIO chip is implemented in some off-the-wall way,
and BYE just won't work.
Now it seems to me that a much simpler program could be written to take the
place of BYE.  Most of what it would have to do is manage the USR Password
modem (SMODEM 1200 act-alike).  Since the port could be configured to be
AUXIN:/AUXOUT:, most of the IO is taken care of, and protection can be done
very nicely within CP/M 3.
Can anyone who has some working knowledge of the innards of CP/M 3 give me
some pointers as to writing such a program?

Subject: MDM716-727 BUG FIX
To: INFO-MODEM7@mit-mc, INFO-CPM@mit-mc

MDM716 through MDM727 has a problem in the new robustness of the
protocol when receiving binary files (.COM, .AQM, e47}c) from a host
on ARPANET/MILNET using a compatible modem protocol such as MMODEM
on ITS.  ASCII file down loading is OK but binary files abort the
transfer if a Control-D is received when searching for SOH.  Since
Control-D is the EOT character, things end abruptly.  So far as I
know, this problem does not occur when transferring binary files
between two micros over a direct phone line connection.  However,
the following change will fix things in all cases.

; capable of receiving a 'CRC' check.  At the end of that time a NAK is
; sent which tells the sender to use CHECKSUM checking instead of CRC.
; This allows automatic compatability with systems implementing CRC -
; (Cyclic Redundancy Checking).  The search for SOH will cycle through
; one record interval and ignore noise or characters sent by the remote
; for any purpose (such as progress reporting).  So extraneous char-
; acters that are sometimes sent by remote-end protocol will be gobbled
; up until the first SOH. EOT is tested only as the first returned

godalmighty dam.  i gather that anything short of perfection is
to be avoided; that if one cannot explain what's happening in a
hurricane you shouldn't warn anyone that it is coming.

your analysis is insteresting, but I do not know how to "change"
a hard disk, and I can assure you that fn 37 has managed to
write garbage all over the directory in two different hard disk
systems. by your logic I should not warn anyone about that since
I don't know why it does that.

i followed the discussion with some interest; reseting the write
vector seems to be the REAL name of the fn 37.  I hadn't known
that when I wrote my piece; indeed, i put the note about 37 on
the net at the same time that I turned in the article.

Guys, I know from nuttin about Vector 3s and not much more about the software
you're implementing... but I DO have a system looking to Default disk Same
User Area (e.g., from B3 to A3) first, and then to Default disk User Area
0.  Works for everything but overlays!  Grabbed it from two different files,
a somewhat documented explanation and source code can be found (much to my
surprise and pleasure) in my article TOADBIOS.DOC now residing in all its glory
at SIMTEL20 MICRO:<CPM.GENDOC>TOADBIOS.DOC.1, available via ANONYMOUS FTP.
(And more glory to the original patch authors!)

Hope it can be of use.

Regards, and good luck.

Subject: Response to Champion query
To: info-cpm@amsaa.arpa
Via:  IBM-SJ; 12 Mar 84 14:01-PST

In response to the query for information on the CHAMPION accounting system,
based on dBASE runtime package.
 
I have had occasion to evaluate a number of accounting packages over the past
few years.  With all of these I was struck with the varying degree of user-
UNfriendliness, opacity of the documentation, difficulty of setup, and (for
2-floppy systems) the necessity of continually swapping disks.  EXCEPT for
CHAMPION.
 
I recently visited Tianjin University, in Peoples Republic of China, to lecture
on "Desktop Computing for Small Businesses". For this trip, Champion Software
(then Data Base Research) supplied me with a full copy of their system .  My
experience while preparing for the trip, as well as during the lectures/demos
was uniformly positive.
 
The system fits on a SINGLE DSDD disk (we used a Kaypro-4), with all data on
the second disk.  The installation is smooth and well documented.  We never
encountered a single bug or unexplained behavior.  Help is available at any
time with references back to the (large) manual.  For dealers they supply a
"demo setup" procedure which is an excellent introduction to the system.
(probably a user can get this by asking.)
 
The price is a bit steep ($2500, I think), but you can get a full money refund
in 30 days.  (They protect themselves by having the system lock up at 200
transactions unless you input a password, which you only can get by signing
a release of your rights to a refund.)
 
I have not tried it on large masses of data, so I cannot attest to its per-
formance under those conditions.  It is installed on a hard disk and seems
to work like a charm (Kaypro-10).
 
The data structures are obscure/encrypted, but these would not usually be
accessed by the typical user.  For the advanced dBASE user who wants to twiddle
the data, or custom-design reports, They will sell you the file structure info
for $200.
 
All in all, I reccommend this system unconditionally.  By the way, there was a
recent issue of Interface Age which compared a whole bunch of integrated
bookkeeping systems, on a feature-by-feature basis.  Well worth examining if
you are considering spending this kind of money.

In-Reply-To: Message from "meier%isl@AMSAA.ARPA" of Mon 12 Mar 84 18:08:20-PST

I ran a similar system for 2+ years.  I give unqualified recommendations on
SD Systems boards for reliability and functionality.  They have never ever
given me so much as a glitch, even when I've moved from place to place.

HOWEVER!  There are a few things to think about.  The VfyII I got in Dec '81
was part of their SBC-200,ExpIII,etc board set, which does not strictly
conform to 696 standards.  That's one problem (though I could run any number
of boards I wanted to run with little problem, including SSM I/O, Heuristics
Speechlab, MD MultI/O, a QT clock, and more).  The new boards that SD is
advertising DOES conform to 696, however, so that's a step in the right
direction.

Another problem is that the formats understood by the VfyII and supported by
SD Systems are not widely used.  Practically the only way I could move files
from my SD higher density disks onto my new Compupro system was to do a copy
from the orig's to SSSD 8", and then read that standard format.  A pain for
100+ disks, not to mention what you have to go through if you have more.

These two problems are the only reservations I have about the VFYII,

I have a Shugart Associates 850 drive which I am trying to connect to a
Morrow Designs Dick Jockey 2D (double density) controller (memory mapped
version). The 850 has many plugs and straps possible, and mine came from
a salvage depot with nothing plugged. Does anybody out there know the
canonical way to select the options? I tried the ones the 850 manual
said were plugged at the factory, but the drive wouldn't select. The
drive was asserting ready however, so that much at least was working.
Any help would be appreciated.

    Some time ago someone posted the following suggestion for FTP'ing ITS
    format files to get rid of thepadding bits in each 36-bit word:

    >quote (> is the FTP prompt)
    type "l 8"

    Entering these two lines seems to set things up properly on the UNIX
    system I work on, even though FTP does not have the
    TENEX mode (type?).

    There is still the need to eliminate the first 4 bytes using ITCVT
    (or using dd on a UNIX system).

    Hope this helps.

happy to hear that Selectronics still exists -- when I was at Drexel in
the early 60's it was a favorite hangout of some of us radio amateurs.
The people who ran it seemed to have no idea of the market value of the
stuff they had, but they knew to the penny what they had paid for it -
and eventually they would be able to make a profit, I guess, if they
held whatever it was long enough.

The stuff they sold was always good or you could take it back (unheard
of among Philly surplus dealers at the time) and the prices were often
fabulous.

Once a friend and I bought a whole gang of computer circuit boards from
them because we needed the power transistors for a project.  When done
strippilng them we cut all the little daughter boards off them, went
down to Arch St.  (Philly's Radio Row, soon to be a victim of urban
renewal) and sold the daughter boards to  another dealer -- got the
power transistors for free and made a net profit!

It's nice to know they are still doing the same stuff after 20 years.

Subject:  Champion questions
To:  info-cpm@amsaa

I have had a couple very positive responses on "The Champion" accounting
system to date and am very seriously considering purchasing it.  There
are however three nagging questions that still remain in my mind.

      1.  Just how much of a nuisance are the menus if you don't really
          need to use them?

      2.  Since it is written in an interpretive language (dBASE with runtime),
          is it slow to the point of being aggravating?

      3.  I know it is available for the PC but is it also available for CP/M?

Rene Moore mentioned an issue of Interface Age which contained an article that
compared several business accounting packages.  Rene, could you pinpoint the
exact issue?  I haven't been able to locate it yet.

The price of this software, as far as I,m concerned is staggering but if it
is indeed "The Champion" as it's name implies, it may well be worth it. (I
can't believe I said that.)

Yes, I have seen Champion working under CP/M. Actually, since it is
written in DBASE II, it will run on any machine that supports DBASE II.
One nice thing that I noticed that it requires very little disk space
for programs (compared to CB80 or Mirosoft Compiled programs). Since the
program is  I/O bound, The fact that they are interpreted should not be
much of a problem. As a matter of fact, since most of the accounting
programs I know mostly do sequential file I/O in basic, this one may
even be faster.

	SETDRU.DOC
	SETDRU8080.COM
	SETDRUZ80.COM
	UNSETDRU.COM

These files form the basis of a BDOS filter that can be used to direct
search of files under CP/M 2.2 (and CP/M Plus). One of the most
popular uses for this filter is to allow WordStar overlays to reside
on any drive/user (either the same as WS.COM or another entirely) and
to allow WordStar to be executed from any drive/user.

The documentation is quite complete; the files were built from a
combination of a C user interface and to M80 programs, which I will
upload if demand merits. Note that the original program was a Z80-only
affair; I converted it to 8080 code. UNSETDRU can de-install a
redirection filter but is not necessary as long as the original file
is properly backed-up before using SETDRU.

While installing MDM724 (from 712) I noticed a fairly serious omission in

was some earlier version which explained them.

I would like to make a suggestion to those responsible for updating this great
modem series.

WHY DON'T YOU PUT A JUMP TABLE IN THE MAIN PROGRAM FOR ALL YOUR ENTRY POINTS?
AND LEAVE IT THERE.  IT WORKS GREAT FOR YOUR BIOS, DOES IT NOT?

That way we poor souls out here won't have to search through dumps to find the
new addresses everytime there is an upgrade.

Subject: More on really big files
To: info-cpm@amsaa.ARPA

Since not all this wound up on info-cpm, let me summarize:

Sam Hahn (SHAHN@SUMEX-AIM) wanted to know how to break up
a big file (400k) so he could fit it on a Sing-Sided Single-Densiy
8-inch disk, for transfer between CP/M systems.

I suggested (CIARALDI@ROCHESTER) using PIP, with the
options that let you start and stop copying with a 
particular string.

Dave Kirschbaum (ABM.ISCAM@USC-ISID) suggested using
HEXUFY, then chopping up with a standard text editor.

Mark Becker (shows on my system as @MIT-MC:CENT.MBECK@MIT-OZ,
I don't know the significance of the two @'s) suggested
writing a program to handle this, copying until the disk
was full, then resettign the drive and prompting the user
to change disks.

I replied to him that it might be nice to have the
features of MOVE.COM in such a program, so as to 
be able to copy large files on a single-drive system.

That's it to date.
It seems to me I have heard of a program that chops up
files automatically, originally used fro backing up
hard siks, since they could have files that would
not fit on a floppy. Is there a public domain version
of this? Or a commercial one?

Subject: Received Turbo Pascal for the Apple(tm) CP/M(tm)
Article-I.D.: ihuxp.674

Just a note for those who are interested in Turbo Pascal, but haven't
ordered it yet.  I have heard of some who have waited some time to
receive their order.  Well, I am glad to report that I ordered my copy
on Feb. 29 (by phone) and received it yesterday (March 12).  I got the
Apple CP/M version (I have a PCPI Appli-Card(tm)).  It came on two
disks.  There were sample programs on the second disk.

	I didn't have much time to play around with it last night.  But,
I did try the terminal installation program--it worked fine.  (The PCPI
Appli-Card software emulates a Televideo 920/950.)

CDOS users: Get M7CD-1.ASM, the overlay for Cromemco systems.

After you overlay MDM728.COM using DEBUG, patch the following
locations to NOPs (binary zeros): 2E5A, 2E5B, 2E5C, 2E5D.

This will disable the CP/M disk stat call function 1Fh which is
not implemented in the current version of CDOS.  The MDM728 DIR
function will then work, but will show 0k left on the disk.
That's livable, and certainly better than before when CDOS gave
an error message and jumped out of MDM728 to return to the system.

Rather than issue a new version to undo what Irv did to MDM728, I've
decided that my system will have MDM728 as the standard until there is
some reason for MDM730 to be issued.  Bob Plouffe says that it was
Wayne Masters who issued 729, but Irv's name is in there and my
opinion is that Irv probably told him to do it because he (Irv) was
busy at the time.  Bob has asked Dave Hardy at Sysop Clearinghouse

As a user of Compupro Disk 1 controller for 1.5 years, I can
wholehartedly recommend it to anybody (I also have very good things to
say about some of their other boards and systems). My only critisism is
the system software (BIOS) that comes with it. Being an ex-systems
programmer, I can tell that such a good hardware deserves better
software. Don't get me wrong, the BIOS is good and it works, but anybody
who will use this board with Compupro CPU 88/85, should look at Tommy
Lanier's software (Lanier Computer Systems, ALABAMA). Fully interrupt
driven BIOS with 4 full track buffers really make a difference in the
performance. Contact me for more information.

As far as 5" floppies are concerned, I happen to have a slightly
different opinion. My experience with 5" floppies have shown me that
they are definitely not as reliable as 8" floppies and neither as fast.
Therefore using them on Compuro equipment would be like putting a VW
engine in a Porshe (Yes, I know their new multiuser machine Compupro-10
uses them, but if you think about it, that machine really needs a hard
disk to be really useful. So, floppies, in my opinion, are just for
backup).  This problem of disk incompatability is nothing new. We had it
for the 8 bit CP/M world for years, and solved it mostly by software
(remember MODEM7 anyone?). Yes, the 8" IBM standard helped, but
everybody had access to Modem7. As far as using MSDOS on Compuro, well,
without the graphics and so many different terminals, I wonder how much
of the IBM software is useful and not available for CP/M. Ofcourse, for
a developement system, there is MSPRO to produce IBM software and
diskettes.

1. CompuPro is now distributing Tony Pietsch's HMX BIOS for CP/M
2.2 systems, and his TMX BIOS for CP/M 8/16; both are ENORMOUS
improvements over the stuff that Compupro used to put out.  (It
was only recently that they discovered there was any such things
as software...)

2. There is a wonderful machine called a Disk Maker that has an
S-100 board, and will drive 5 1/4" drives; it can manage to
convert almost anything to something that almost anything else
can read.  At $1500 it's the cat's meow for anyone who's got the
problem of transferring stuff from one format to another.

3. Tony Pietsch has designed a new S-100 board that does all the
IBM PC Graphics; it makes the CompuPro systems about 85-90%
compatible with the IBM PC (and one whack of a lot faster).  It
should be for sale Real Soon Now (watch upcoming comlumns for
more info).  A brass board exists and works, so it's only a
question of time.

I agree with your high opinion of Compupro hardwarem, and low opinion of
their software, although Tony Pietsch's stuff is a leap forward in
capability and is presently being shipped (2.2 for sure; I have not seen
a CP/M-86 implementation from him yet). I second the motion on Tommy
Lanier's BIOSes and XIOS for MP/M-86 - excellent and very reasonably priced,
though you must have a little hacker in you to bring it up cleanly (why
have an S-100 system if you aren't a hacker?)
I am running both standard 8" and minifloppies on my Gifford MP/M-816
system; this requires two Disk-1 controllers! Hopefully, the Disk-1A
will get around this problem, but I think the board is about as real as
the SPU-Z (meaning not yet released). I can read IBM or Morrow MD formats
on the mini, useful now that DRI is distributing theor software on IBM
compatible minis.

I am VERY glad to hear of an up-to-date S-100 graphics board coming out
that's compatible with a big chunk of the industry.  I'm not running MS-DOS
or even CPM-86 yet (haven't found a 16-bit board promising to run in my
Decision I yet), but will eventually.

There's lots of stuff out there to make graphics, but what's the use when
you're incompatible with most other users?  Now if we can find the standard
software for graphics in good old CP/M 2.2 to match the growing standardiz-
ation in the 16-bit world...  Any comments/suggestions?  Would LOVE to play
with graphics, and am willing to invest money/hardware/time, but heck --
it's like my playing with my Freedom 100 graphics (actually, just a small
character subset, good for lines, corners, etc.) -- why bother when only
another Freedom 100 owner running MBASIC or 8080/Z80 assembler can do
anything with it?

To: INFO-MODEM7@mit-mc, INFO-CPM@mit-mc, INFO-MICRO@mit-mc

The following message has been sent to Irv Hoff via CompuServe:

Irv,

The release of mdm729 accomplished the following:

1.  Removed the CR,LF before each error message which will
cause error messages to overwrite each other,  thus if there
are multiple hits causing repeats, you won't be able to tell it
unless you sit there watching your screen.  If you leave the room
and there were any hits (CRC error, etc) only the last one will
show and you can't tell if there are multiple hits that occurred.
The CR,LF's were there for a reason.---so you can see if multiple
errors occurred. MDM729 causes this feature to be broken.

2.  By-passed my note in MDM728.MSG that explained the new useage
of the byte that was formally at the ACKNAK location.  - and renamed
it to NORETRY in the source code for MDM728.. That byte has nothing
whatsoever to do with ACKNAK any more.

3.  Added my correction of EOT detection.  Fine, but I already
had put that in 728.

4.  Corrected some minor misstatements.  Fine but those could have
been deferred to a time when a new release was either NECESSARY or
DESIRABLE (new features or NEEDED bug fix.).

You have perhaps seen Keith's note about holding at 728 on
his RCPM and the MIT/SIMTEL20 archives will also be held
at 728 until there is a real reason to update. I believe
that the SYSOP Sys operated by Dave Hardy is doing the
same thing.

There is nothing added in 729 worthwhile over 728 and in fact 
removes a feature and some information.  By the way, I had two
reports this morning:

	1.  The ring-back function is no longer working when
	using a PMMI modem.  ( Hayes can't handle it but PMMI can
	so that feature should not have been removed.)  I don't
	know at what version number that it got broken. Perhaps
	you do.

	2.  The change at LOGLP1 is reported by Eric Stork to give
	strange results.  I will send you his message later.

I thought that you were going to quit..

To: ABN.ISCAMS@USC-ISID.ARPA
cc: info-cpm@AMSAA.ARPA, info-micro@BRL.ARPA

Thanks for your reply.  In summary, there are several ways:

1.	Use DDT to break, and PIP to rebuild, the large files.  This is
	tedious and error-prone, but will work.

2.	Use PIP with the start and end options.  This requires knowing a lot
	about the insides of a (possibly binary) file.  Also, the segment
	sizes are not easily determined.

3.	Use SQ and USQ to Huffman-ize the files.  For me, there was quite
	a savings in space to SQ my file, and this worked.  Does have
	a limitation if your binary file doesn't have a good distribution
	of char's for SQ to really make a difference.  Also, still have
	a problem if the squeezed file is still too big.  SQ'ing a second
	time still reduces, but there's a limit.

4.	Use a HEXIFY program.  This is a pretty good solution which requires
	a step to break up the hexified program.  If the source file were
	nearly the size of a disk, one is pretty stuck, since the hexified
	file is larger than the original; probably want a hexify program which
	can operate in stages (could be this already exists -- in the end,
	I didn't need to do this).

5.	Custom-build a program which steps through the original file,
	and copies onto another disk until that disk is full, closes, resets,
	and continues until N disks are full and the original file is
	scanned.  Most time-consuming solution, but there will be cases in
	which this is the best solution, I imagine.

6.	Do directory twiddling to rename the extents of the big file so that
	each extent looks like a separate file.  Would require directory 
	munging of the file, so potentially dangerous, but probably doable
	in an easy and "correct" way so that the directory is not damaged.
	PIP could than be used to rebuild the file.

Thanks to all of you who responded.  For those of you who didn't see my 
original request, I needed to transfer large (>400k) files from a non-standard
(SDSystems) hidensity format to my new Compupro hardware.  My apologies for
running on at such length.

me offer a TRUCE proposition:

1.  When you said that you were going to give me a little fix
to include in MDM728, I recall that you referred to a request
from Sigi that you couldn't locate at the moment and that you
were going to send me another message and tell me what it was.
So, when I got the other message (which requested the LOGLP1
change), I assumed that was  referring to.
Sorry that I mis-understood.

2. Yes, you are quit didn't test the change that
deleted the CR,LF's.  Now that you p CR,LF ++"
at SHOWERR, I agree that I was wrong and hereby apolog be relabelled to NORETRY and
that as the overlays get upgraded wcessary that
they get fixed also.  In the meantime, a note such a should suffice.

4.  After you look at the fix at LOGLP that I h
and tested it to your satisfaction, I suggest that it be include ring-back no longer works
for PMMI although I agree that this onrtant but
there ARE still plenty of people with PMMI's and only ose even if they are not an
RCPM.

6.  No disagreement on the timieturning to CP/M.

7.  With respect to other systems using compatks or as direct dial-ups, please
understand that one of the tremethis program is
that it remain compatible with them and operable iligence should be maintained
to guarantee that it remains that wer, currently
investigating a problem report on downloading from e.)

I believe that you have provided the community with a very vrt on multiple overlays to
allow a great number of systems to useanding.
I also have been involved for about the past four and a hdding new and improved
capabilities.  I kept the system from getttaying
that way many times long before you got involved.  Many other interested/capable
parties also.

Yes, Ron Fowler's work, inchim, may become the next standard for a bunch of purposes, but inne that I have had for a
long time  - i.e, to keep the program uss possible and
from being broken.  It hasn't been easy.

3.  I suggest that the ACKNAK flag be relabelled to NORETRY and
that as the overlays get upgraded when-and-as-if necessary that
they get fixed also.  In the meantime, a note such as I included
in MDM728.MSG (available in Detroit) should suffice.

4.  After you look at the fix at LOGLP that I have recommended
and tested it to your satisfaction, I suggest that it be included
in the next release.

5.  Suggest we look for the reason that ring-back no longer works
for PMMI although I agree that this one isn't all important but
there ARE still plenty of people with PMMI's and only one phone
line who use ring-back for their own use even if they are not an
RCPM.

6.  No disagreement on the timing change on returning to CP/M.

7.  With respect to other systems using compatible protocols
that are available on other networks or as direct dial-ups, please
understand that one of the tremendous values of this program is
that it remain compatible with them and operable in all respects.
So far, I believe this is so and due-diligence should be maintained
to guarantee that it remains that way. (I am, however, currently
investigating a problem report on downloading from USC-ECLB using
the host compatible protocol there.)

I believe that you have provided the community with a very valuable
service and that the user-provided support on multiple overlays to
allow a great number of systems to use MDM7xx is outstanding.
I also have been involved for about the past four and a half years
in finding bugs, providing fixes and adding new and improved
capabilities.  I kept the system from getting broken and staying
that way many times long before you got involved.  Many other
important contributions came from several other interested/capable
parties also.

Yes, Ron Fowler's work, including a bunch of features that I gave
him, may become the urposes, but in the
meantime my intent has only been the one that I have had for a
long time  - i.e, to keep the program useful as widely as possible and
from being broken.  It hasn't been easy.

To:  info-cpm@amsaa

I was aware of the jump table located within the overlay itself and up
until tonight (this morning) I was under the impression that all those
little "DS 3" pseudo ops had to be replaced by "JMP's" into the main
program.

When they call them overlays they mean it.  Those DS's leave nice neat
little undisturbed jump instructions from the orignial .COM file,
"because" as "everyone" know's a DS does not alter memory.

Therefore my overlay, your overlay and everyone else's overlay will
"plug in and play" on any version of MDM7 after it has initially been
customized and optioned.  It's a one shot operation.

Jesse (you should call them windows)

P.S. Thanks for the USR overlay Bob,  I'll blend  it with mine and
     shoot you a copy somehow.

To:  info-cpm@amsaa


I just had another disk crash on my Shugart SA-850 Floppy Disk Drive.
Beginning to wonder about the wisdom of using cheap disks in these
units.  I buy them new and I clean the heads occasionally but I still
experiences crashes from time to time.  And of course it is always on
the most valuable disk in the house.

I have been saving the crashed diskettes to get a flavor for which brand
seems to be the most susceptible to self destruction.  So far CDC is the
crash leader.

I've heard that the head load pressure on the Shugart is high and that
some disks don't fare well (softer oxide or something like that).

I am becoming a believer.  Slowly.  Painfully slowly.

Subject: Need modem prog for Altos 8000-2
Article-I.D.: ihuxw.736

Help!  I am trying to find a modem program for an old Altos 8000-2 
(CP/M, Z80 processor, 2 8" DD disks, 64K ram).  I would like the program
to support the Ward Christianson XMODEM protocol.  CROSSTALK does not
seem to support this protocol (at least when I tried, it wouldn't), and
neither does ASYNC.  I know that modem7 has been adapted for approximately
42 000 000 different machines so it seems reasonable that somebody will have
a version that works on an Altos 8000-2.  I foolishly purchased a modem
before finding that getting the software was the real problem...

I could probably, with a great deal of work, adapt some version of
modem7 to the Altos, but that is not practical for me in that the Altos
is my father's and he lives 700 miles from me.

Pointers to somebody with an Altos 8000-2 would be greatly appreciated.

I have the original plus about 5 different versions that I have used in
the last 6 years.  The first supports the Ithaca Audio CPU board and the
Jade serial/parallel I/O port with KC tape.  I dont use KC tape any more
because I am using Jade DD disk controller.  I have also modified my board
to use 2716's but no real problem for you.  Please send me your phone

show characters output from the modem locally rather than
getting remote echo.  Remote echo is looked at only to
determine if characters went out (and thus echoed) so that the pointer

Subject: Using NSWP2 on the Kaypro 10 or ADM3 terminal


            NSWP2 for the Kaypro 10 or ADM3A terminal
            =========================================

As supplied,  NSWP2 does not use the inverse video sequences, you 
must alter the COM file with DDT first.

   ////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

How  to set-up NSWP2.COM to show $SYS and $R/O files with inverse 
video for the Kaypro 10 (and the brand new Kaypro 4).

All you need is DDT.COM and a copy of NSWP2.COM.

A0>DDT NSWP2.COM <c/r>

-S104 <c/r>         this is the inverse on sequence
 03 <c/r>           03 means a three-byte video sequence
 1b <c/r>           1b is hexadecimal for escape
 42 <c/r>           42 is "B"
 30 <c/r>           30 is "0"
 .  <c/r>           entering a "." exits SET mode of DDT

-S10b <c/r>         this is the inverse off sequence
 03 <c/r>
 1b <c/r>           escape
 43 <c/r>           "C"
 30 <c/r>           "0"
 .  <c/r>

-g0                 g0 exits DDT and returns to CP/M

warm boot

A0>SAVE 42 NSWP-K10.COM <c/r>

(NOTE: You may also specify a 4-byte video sequence and add "B1" and 
       "C1" calls for half intensity inverse video)

That's  it ...  plain and simple.   Now any files with the  $SYS, 
$R/O,  archive, or any other bit set will show up with an inverse 
video block in the filetype extension when listed with NSWP2.

   /////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Also to make the screen clear when NSWP2 signs on, set the following
memory locations as shown:

1D13H = 20	1D14H = 20	1D15H = 20	1D16H = 20

1D17H = 1A  <-- this is the clear screen call 1ah or 26 decimal

   //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Many thanks to Dave Rand for this FINE utility program,   I would 
be lost without it on my hard disk drive.

To:  info-cpm@amsaa

I have been using VEDIT 1.37 for about a year now and just love it.  I
got a chance to rummage through the manual on v1.38 today and was really
amazed by the number of improvements that have been made.  Some of those
that I can remember are:

	1.  Horizontal scrolling
	2.  Help file
	3.  Arithmetic registers (add/sub only, for now)
	4.  Ret vs. esc,esc to end command mode
	5.  Default to text reg 0 on return
	6.  Quit but stay in editor
	7.  Expanded search/replace
	8.  Default disk/user for help and ini files
	9.  Keyboard map
	10. Expanded command set
	11. Bit 7 handling (Wordstar too)
	12. Output file name on status line

For those of you who haven't used or seen VEDIT it comes highly
recommended.  It is the best darned editor for writing programs that I
have used.  It has limited although serviceable use as a word processor.
As a program editor it runs rings around it's competition.

I don't know if they updated those lousy installation procedures but
here's hoping they did.  You have to know quite a bit about your
terminal if you want to do a really custom version.  Otherwise you can
use one of their "terminal in a can" routines.

Fellow CP/Mers - My being volunteered as the source of information on how to
FTP the newly-loaded PC-BLUE files from Simtel20 reminds me of the familiar
situation where the advertising department gets ahead of the engineering 
department.  At any rate, I have a blurb on getting stuff from the archives, 
but it does not address the PC-BLUE files since they weren't there when I wrote
the thing.  Give me a few days to fix it up, and I'll send it to you.

What do you mean by a "head crash?"

It sounds like your drive is the culprit
rather than the medium.  We use CDC
exclusively on 1 each Tandon (80 tr),
TEAC(80 tr), Apple, and Brand-X for 
apple.  At least 3 others in my acquaintance
do so always.  We are quite satisfied with
the result.

Better look at your drive again.

Subject:  RE: DISK CRASHES
To:  info-cpm@amsaa

My earlier comment on disk crashes was not meant as an indictment
against any one floppy disk manufacturer.  It was an effort to gain
other's experiences with inexpensive media on "Shugart 850's".

Soft oxide causes media wear while hard oxide causes head wear.  If that
is an accurate statement, then depending on what drive you are using,
there must be some media which works better or worse with that
particular hardware.

I like to get the most for my money as I'm sure we all do.  My point was
that perhaps the cheaper disks are not necessarily the best buy if it
means the loss of critical data and the resulting reconstruction time.
I don't use floppys that often, and am therefore mortified when I hear
that awful hissing sound as oxide separates from mylar.

Does anyone use a VAX running VMS to FTP files from the CPM directory on
Simtel20?  On our VAX I can FTP ASCII file fine, but I can't get the COM files.
They transfer down to our VAX but they don't seem to be coming across properly
(at least when I dump the COM files it looks like a bunch of garbage and the
programs don't run when brought down from the VAX to a micro).  I'm doing
bget's (Binary Get) when I FTP those files.  Is there something else I should
be trying?  Anyone have any ideas?

    Thanks.

Found the problem with the PMMI ringback.  My fault.  When I fixed MDM727 for
(0-9) numbers on redialing, and renumbered some labels, missed this one. 
However, it's still a bit of a flakey circuit, as we wait 7 seconds after
dialing, hope it goes through all the exchanges and has rung once, then we hang
up, wait 5 seconds and go back and redial.

Call this MDM727-9.MOD


SUBJECT :  MDM727 - MDM729  MOD FOR PMMI USERS FOR RINGBACK NUMBERS

FROM    :  IRV HOFF W6FFC

DATE    :  18 MAR 84


       This mod affects just PMMI modems that are using MDM727 and
       later, including MDM728 or MDM729.  Change one byte:

             097F  from 75  to  69       (then SAVE 73 sectors)

       The ringback circuit should then work normally.  When I fixed
       MDM727 to allow redialing the new (0-9) numbers and changed some
       some labels, this one was overlooked, sorry.   If changing the
       source code, make the following change:
;.....
;
;
; Hang up, redial and listen for dial tone
;
RINGBK1: CALL   HANGUP          ;hang up the phone
         MVI    B,RBWAIT        ;wait 5 seconds before redialing..
         CALL   TIMER           ;..for line to clear, etc.

Netlandians,

I like the "background process" idea of both Word*'s PRINT function
and UNSPOOL.  However, I have a REAL problem with the keyboard being
dead the majority of the time.  I've read warnings that in Word* there
may be an occasional delay, so "heads-up typing is not recommended" or
something to that effect.  However, waiting many many seconds for ANY
key response/echo at ALL, then maybe entering 3 or 4, and then another
LONG delay -- and none of this correlating to disk reads (usually),
and with a nice little 1.5 or 2 Kb buffer on my Mannesman Tally --
where's the bloody delay?  I have DMA on my Decision I disk controllers,
sure, but disk reads don't take THAT long.

Any ideas?  I've tried my CBIOS patched to both Xon/Xoff  and ...forget
the alternative .. DTR? -- anyway, no difference there, so the BIOS shouldn't
be waiting around for the printer.

Both functions are effectively useless for any sort of text input because
of this excessive delay (with Word* being the WORST!).  Would appreciate 
some advice from the CP/M wizards...

Several reasonably good BASIC compilers are available under CP/M-68K, as is

a rarity.  I believe MicroCraft (Dallas Texas, but I don't have their phone

DIMENSION 68000 machine, but the MIGHT sell you a copy.

P.S.  Can you send me an address I can ARPA to?  Or else a SNAIL-MAIL

that it uses direct BIOS callss rather than bDOS so is not

To: Info-Cpm@AMSAA.ARPA


SUBJECT :  MDM727 - MDM729  MOD FOR PMMI USERS FOR RINGBACK NUMBERS

FROM    :  IRV HOFF W6FFC

DATE    :  18 MAR 84


       This mod affects just PMMI modems that are using MDM727 and
       later, including MDM728 or MDM729.  Change one byte:

             097F  from 75  to  69       (then SAVE 73 sectors)

       The ringback circuit should then work normally.  When I fixed
       MDM727 to allow redialing the new (0-9) numbers and changed some
       some labels, this one was overlooked, sorry.   If changing the
       source code, make the following change:
;.....
;
;
; Hang up, redial and listen for dial tone
;
RINGBK1: CALL   HANGUP          ;hang up the phone
         MVI    B,RBWAIT        ;wait 5 seconds before redialing..
         CALL   TIMER           ;..for line to clear, etc.
         CALL   DIALBGN         ;disconnect, reconnect, wait for tone
         JNC    DIAL12          ;go redial number
         JMP    DIALAGN         ;no dial tone heard
;.....
;
-    -    -    -    -    -    -    -    -    -    -    -    -    -    -

(next to last line was:    JNC   DIAL13    which was incorrect)

Make sure your CBIOS LISTSTAT routine is properly configured.
Many are not configured at all, returning list device always
ready or always not ready.  Assuming you have that working
right then it may be the way you configured WordStar.  If you
use the CP/M list device for the printer WS.COM does not check
LISTSTAT.  There is a patch to add list device status checking
inside WS.COM, look in the <CPM.WSTAR> directory at SIMTEL20.
Otherwise use WordStar's internal drivers, which will require
that you answer certain questions at configuration time about
port addresses and status bits.

Keith,

Thanks much for your quick response on my query as to reasons for excessive
keyboard delays in UNSPOOL and WORD*.  I did NOT realize using the CP/M List
device in WS for the printer means LISTSTAT is not checked -- a significant
thing, and maybe the root of my problem.  Tallyho -- off to the enchanting
world of INSTALWS.COM  (gotta love it!)

Subject: Distributing modifications to F80
Article-I.D.: ecsvax.2172

<>
  Recently, I was given a set of disassemblies of some of the Microsoft
FORTRAN-80 library subroutines (the person who disassembled the routines
and I are both registered owners of F80).  During Spring Break, I rewrote
the floating point multiply and divide routines for the Z80 (resulting in
improvements of 25% and 37%, respectively, for time in floating point
intensive programs).  Considering the discussion now going on in net.general
(and net.followup), can I give the benefits of my labor to others?  I can
see three possibilities for this:

1)	Forget about the whole thing.  Use the modifications in my own
	work, but don't take the chance on distributing them.

2)	Distribute the .REL files.  This would allow others to use them,
	but would not allow others to locate and fix any bugs that might
	be present (after all, I spent only 1 day on the project).

3)	Distribute the .MAC files.  This is the most ideal from my standpoint,
	as I may have made some errors, or there may be a more efficient
	routine.  However, I would guess that about 20% of the actual code
	is still Microsoft's, and certainly the algorithm is Microsoft's--
	I only translated it into Z80 code.

Please give me your ideas as to the legal/moral solution to this problem.
Do you feel that I would be violating the copyright laws in going ahead with
options 2 or 3?  The license agreement I signed states in part:  "Party
agrees that unauthorized copying or disclosure will cause great damage..."
Will either of these options violate this license agreement?
I should add that I would distribute them without cost (e.g., through
net.sources).

I will summarize any answers I get to the net.  If you wish, I will keep
your id annonymous.

Subject: Apple CP/M Wordstar with Olympia
To: info-cpm@amsaa.ARPA

I have a friend with a problem integrating his system.
He has an Apple II Plus with the Microsoft Z-80 card and CP/M.
He also has an Apple Super Serial card, and this is connected
to an Olympia daisy wheel typewriter/printer.
Under Apple DOS, everything works fine. But when using CP/M,
the printer messes up. It prints for a whhile, then starts
losing characters. This is especially noticeable with Wordstar.

The people he bought the printer from can't tell him if it has
X-ON/X-OFF, ETX/ACK, or some other protocol. It sounds like the
buffer in the printer is overflowing (he is driving it at 1200 baud,
and the printer prints at maybe 12 characters per second), but
he doesn't know how to take advantage of this.

So, the question is: how can he get the printer to work right under
CP/M? e.g. in Wordstar he could select ETX-ACK, but since the printer
is configured as the CP/M LST: device, where would the software
read the ACK coming back? Same with X-ON/X-OFF.
Is there CP/M BIOS support for this, as there seems to be
in Apple DOS? Does it have to be enabled in some way?

Thanks for any help you can give.

Assuming you are talking about CP/M 2.2, the deblocking is done in the
BIOS, which is system dependent. The portable operating system (BDOS),
doesn't know anything about blocking or deblocking. All it expects is to
be able to read and write 128 byte sectors. So, if the disk is formatted
in 128 byte sectors, the answer to your question is:
	CP/M (BDOS or BIOS) DOESN'T DO ANY DEBLOCKING. THE BDOS NEVER DOES
BLOCKING/DEBLOCKING.
One thing that usually happens is called SKEWING, which is used to
increase disk throughput. The logical sector numbers are skewed by an
amount (usually 6 in 8" SSSD format), so that physical to logical
translation takes place according to a skew table (1,7,13,19,2,8,14,....
MOD23(n)).

If you wish to use a size other than 128 bytes, then you have to modify
your BIOS to do blocking and deblocking. The BDOS will not know the
difference.

NetLandians,

Hokay, this is a good one (and I can hear screams of anguish from anyone
connected with Army Communications Command and higher/related echelons)..

I have a real and valid requirement to construct LEGAL and COMPLETE AUTODIN
headers and message/text formatting on a micro -- namely a (ugh, yeccchhh)
Apple II running Pascal.

I'm looking at Mode 1, teletype protocols.  If you all aren't familiar with
AUTODIN (the world-wide Defense Department communications net), forget you
ever heard of it!

This is gonna be a kind of toughie, since the protocols are VERY demanding
and strict, and the whole idea is one of those "Sacred Cows" you mustn't
consider without a multi-megabuck project and 10 years in the making...

But I'm gonna do it anyway.  Would like pointers to software (Pascal, BASIC
(any dialect), C (hooo boy, just starting in C), 8080/Z80 assembler (my
favorite, but would have to translate), even (bleaugh) 6502 assembler.

Cobol?  Naw, please, anything but Cobol!

Any ideas at all (beside a probably justly deserved "Forget it!") would
be sincerely appreciated.  I know the format, just hope I can find the
code to simplify the construction of the bloody thing.  I can do it either
from operator prompting, a menu, or parsing strings of text -- but maximum
automation of repetitious stuff.

Regards, and thanks in advance.

Dave Towson has uploaded a new TRS-80 Model-I overlay for MDM7xx.
It's now available on SIMTEL20 as MICRO:<CPM.MODEM7>M7R1-3.ASM.
Here's what's new in it:

From: David Towson (CSD) <towson at amsaa>
To:   Keith Petersen <w8sdz>
Re:   New TRS-80 Model-I overlay for MDM7xx.

Compared with the existing R1 overlay, the new one has the following
differences:

a.  The installation instructions are correct for the current size of
    MDM7xx.COM.

b.  The code is fully commented.

c.  Material from the general-purpose overlay file, but meaningless in
    a TRS-80 Model-I/III context has been removed.

d.  Labels having meaning in the MDM7xx.ASM context have been equated
    to labels having more meaning in the TRS-80 context, making the
    program more readable (in my opinion).

e.  The label ACKNAK has been changed to NORETRY to reflect current 
    usage, and an explanation is given in the comments.

f.  Equates for NUMLIB address, XFRSIZ and SHOWHEX have been added
    to allow use of new capabilities in MDM728.  They work.

g.  The GOODBYE routine turns off DTR and RTS, and leaves them off.
    They can be turned back on by sending a BREAK in terminal mode 
    (300 millisecond BREAK is supported).


I have experimented with a 4K protocol-transfer buffer, and I really like
it.  Sixteen-K works okay for me, but takes a VERY long time to load in the
protocol-send mode.  With 4K, the pause is quite short (less than 2 seconds),
and very unlikely to cause a timeout on the receive end.

With Apple II and one side diskette (also Quickcode has two diskettes
due to small size of bytes each diskette), how can I solve the problem
when the display says "Insert the Secondary Diskette" and I attempted to
replace the primary one with the secondary one and the message says
"bdos error - R/O" and I know that I have to reset the disk information.
But how can it be done with QUICKCODE?

Also, how can I save generated programs into other diskette rather than
back to the Quickcode diskette (of course, I made the backup ones).

Helpful hints will be appreicated.

Subject: Keyboard Delays While Printing

	The culprit is of course your slow printer.  A character is 
sent to the printer and the BIOS takes forever to send it out while
all you type in is lost.  The fixes are numerous and not too difficult:
*1* the best is to have an interrupt driven console input; this will
not loose a single chr ever (even during disk io, since you say yours
uses DMA which does not require disabling interrupts). *2* patch W*
to use printer ready function; this is easy and enables W* to scan 
for key input while monitoring the printer. *3* somewhat clumsy, but
should work: patch the BIOS so it checks the keyboard while waiting
for a chr to be output to the printer, then stuffs the key chr in some
location where it is retrieved by the console input function (best
would be, of course, to queue the key chars).

Subject: need a full screen, CPM-68K editor
Article-I.D.: wdl1.182

I am looking for a full screen editor for my CPM-68K system.  So far I've
used MINCE from MARK of the Unicorn, an EMACS like editor with only a small
subset of the commands.

Does anyone know of other full screen editors available for the 68000 that
I can read with my CPM system?  Is there a version of vi that is publicly 
available?

Please post your responses to the net.

It very well can be either drive or media.  Early DS drives, including
Shugart 850's suffered from excessive force when heads were loaded on
the media, for read or write opration.  The "tap tap" test showed that
head force could indeed damage media.  If you can take your drives out
from the enclosure, see if the bottom head is fixed or is on a movable
arm.  If the latter, you have a "tri-compliant" design, which Shugart
(and others) abandoned in favor of a bi-compliant design with the lower
head fixed.  It's also possible that the drive simply needs adjustment.

And it also possible that you're using cheap media.  Stick with Dysan,
Maxell and Verbatim.  Avoid private labels, Nashua, Memorex, etc.

Rick,

We can do a modem transfer (if you aren't TOO far away) and have some sort
of modem program (I have KERMIT and MDM728), or I can put it on an 8" floppy
(suggest SSSD, formatted on YOUR machine) if you have an 8" drive.
Otherwise -- can't help.

Re:   MDM728.COM patches to fix network delay problems

Here are the patches to MDM728.COM so that the protocol
modem-turn-around times are not too fast for Satellite
circuits or other networks that have potential packet delays
in excess of 1 second:

I believe that these changes will probably make a lot of
observed problems with MDM7 go away.  I managed to get this to
Irv Hoff before release of MDM730.  He is looking into it and
hopefully will get it in.

Subject:  Re:  Turbo Pascal delays

In an earlier message I told how Borland had lost my original order,
so I placed the order with Customer Service instead of thru the order-
only operator. I called CS on March 7, the receipt is dated the 9th,
and UPS stamped it on the 13th.  I received the disk (8" Z-80) on
March 21, exactly 2 weeks after I spoke with CS.  Considering the fact
that I live on the East coast, that was pretty fast delivery.

I am very happy with the product so far.  The manual has several typos,
but most of them are obvious.  The spreadsheet they give as a sample
program is surprisingly useful, but it does contain one undocumented
command -- /C will clear the current workspace.  I had to resort to
trial-and-error to put a formula into a cell (start with a left paren).
My only major concern is the fact that the command changes I made with
TINST were not saved; I tried to remap DEL into Ctrl-H and Ctrl-H into
Ctrl-B.  TINST acknowledges the changes, but TURBO doesn't.

Overall, the TURBO system reminds me of Apple Pascal, but it runs FAST.

Irv called Bob Clyne who co-sysops my RCPM saying that we should
replace MDM730.COM with the "new MDM730.COM" and he has sent it to
Sysop RCPM and all around the country, as you've said, Bob.  Our
attitude is this:  we do NOT want to carry two programs with the SAME
NAME and will reject this "update".  We will continue to carry the
original MDM730 files, including the source code, until an update is
made to the filename.  We will carry patch fix .ASM files and if you
consider yours to be "ready for release" will put it out immediately.

Irv has done this before, which is why I took away his "ERA"
priveleges on my RCPM.  He was updating files without telling anyone
and without changing the filenames.  It was chaos.  He's so worried
about "what people will think"... What about us RCPM Sysops who have
to try to explain WHY two people who downloaded the same program on
different dates don't have the same version?

I'm going to recommend to the sysops on the clearinghouse that they
reject Irv's "improved MDM730".

Re:   Arghh  MDM730

Oh dear,  I had sent that expeimental patch file for opening up
the max-wait times and fixing the HSNAK and WAITNLP loops back
again so that BYE without 'Q' switch works again.

He is all bent out of shape, has made the changes to the source code
and the .COM file - and has updated all of the bulletin boards including
SYSOP and CIS and w/date 02/27/84 in source file and still MDM730.

Ok, so it works fine and I am pleased it is included in MDM730
dated 03/27/84 but I only meant that as a patch file and not to
require updating of the program.

He has also made a change in the SENDNOW routine which changes some
of the addresses of bytes that I changed in PAT730.ASM  - SO,
don't use PAT730.ASM on this version, infact - THROW IT AWAY
since all of the changes I made are in this new copy of MDM730.

Keith, I notice that you have just put the source code for MDM730
on SIMTEL20  but need to get the revised version of source from
CIS and also the revised .COM file.

Re:   Arghh  MDM730

Ok,  PAT730.ASM is ready but it will work only on the 03/22/84 version,
not the 03/27/84 version because Irv changed the SENDNOW routine
which added some bytes so some of the addresses have changed slightly.

Re:   Arghh  MDM730

Oh dear,  I had sent that experimental patch file for opening up
the max-wait times and fixing the HSNAK and WAITNLP loops back
again so that BYE without 'Q' switch works again.

Irv Hoff is all bent out of shape, has made the changes to the source code
and the .COM file - and has updated all of the bulletin boards including
SYSOP and CIS and w/date 02/27/84 in source file and still MDM730.

Ok, so it works fine and I am pleased it is included in MDM730
dated 03/27/84 but I only meant that as a patch file and not to
require updating of the program.

Keith, I notice that you have just uploaded the source code for
MDM730 but need to get the revised version of source from
CIS and also the revised .COM file.

Re:   Arghh  MDM730

Irv Hoff called Bob Clyne who co-sysops my RCPM saying that we should
replace MDM730.COM with the "new MDM730.COM" and he has sent it to
Sysop RCPM and all around the country, as you've said, Bob.  Our
attitude is this:  we do NOT want to carry two programs with the SAME
NAME and will reject this "update".  We will continue to carry the
original MDM730 files, including the source code, until an update is
made to the filename.  We will carry patch fix .ASM files and since
your PAT730.ASM is ready will put it out immediately.

Irv has done this before, which is why I took away his "ERA"
priveleges on my RCPM.  He was updating files without telling anyone
and without changing the filenames.  It was chaos.  He's so worried
about "what people will think"... What about us RCPM Sysops who have
to try to explain WHY two people who downloaded the same program on
different dates don't have the same version?

I'm going to recommend to the sysops on the clearinghouse that they
reject Irv Hoff's "improved MDM730".

Article-I.D.: emory.1304

I am passing on a question for someone else on campus
so I am a little sketchy on the details of this question.

They are running a Vector Graphics 5005 under CP/M 2.5. CP/M 2.5
was described as a vendor modified CP/M superset allowing several 
users in the MP/M style. The system has a 5 megabyte winchester.

They have found that to allow separate users working on distinct
applications, they must have each user login to a different
user area. Unfortunately, the 5 megabyte disk is marginal and
there is not enough room for separate copies of certain 
applications programs. I am told that CP/M will search User 0
for .com files after failing to find a match in another user
area, but this will not work for programs that use overlays.

Does anyone have a suggestion on how to patch CP/M to allow
the sharing of programs with overlays?

	Has anyone every successfully modified their bios to handle xon/xoff
protocol for the console in a non-interrupt polled system.  This would 
probably require some sort of buffer arrangement, but characters would only
be noticed if some program or the ccp was polling the status port.  I am also
interested in handling a terminal (vt100) where the special function keys
send out three characters one after the other.  This is particularly nasty
when using them for an editor as characters are often lost.  right now, i
have my cns$ot routine sending out 10 nulls when it detects a line feed
so that the terminal has time to scroll. ( i have another terminal which
also requires this because of the xon/xoff problem).  I have an S-100
system built with assorted boards (including Ithaca Audio z80 board and Jade
Double D Disk Controller.  Am I going to have to add an interrupt controller
to resolve the above mentioned problems?  I forgot to mention that this is
for cp/m version 2.2

	I would very much appreciate any information that anyone has.

REMEMBER... Back before we had micros and had purchased our CB's to tune
in to the airwaves and had something to say.   But... because it was
channel "19" and we were "only four wheelers" and we didn't have the
savvy to really understand what was going on it didn't really matter.
Right?  Wrong...   We knew that the air waves were for everyone and we
knew we had a right to be there but the "ratchet jaws" on "multi tonage,
multi axeled, multi, multi everything felt they owned the channel" and
they acted that way.

This is not a private channel with private access rights or private
anything.  Although I may me relatively new to netland it appears to me
as though the powers that be "as concerns MODEM7" feel it is of
particular concern what I or anyone else thinks about who is best
qualified to write enhancements, upgrades, bug fixes or whatever for
this (BETTER THAN THE AVERAGE BEAR) comm program.

;	(Now includes the Hoff patches for BELL and RUB)

;This patch overlay file will restore the capability to get
;progress reports at a remote-end that answers under BYE and
;when the "Q" switch is not used on the command line.  The
;problem was caused when the loop counts in HSNAK and WAITNLP
;were reduced to accomodate the longer max wait times.  The
;solution is to change wait-times and loop-count back again.
;Longer max wait times to accomodate network delays are not
;needed here because of the time spent in the loop anyhow.
;Explanation: Characters sent from the other end because of
;the operation of BYE are gobbled by the loops so advance the
;loop counter and we can run out of loop before the end of 
;verbose reporting - so never get the correct control character.

;Also changed the max wait times at several other locations
;including inside the receive-sector loop.  This SUBSTANTIALLY
;improves performance on networks with packet delays.


;Just assemble this file as an ASM file and overlay the HEX file
;on MDM730.COM with DDT  and SAVE 73 MDM730.COM.   If you have
;the source code, you should be able to locate the changes at
;the labels shown below.   It is NOT INTENDED to change the
;revision number of MDM730 at this time.  If it becomes really
;NECESSARY at a later date to issue a new revision, then the
;revisor should include these changes.  Treat this patch file
;as a customization just like when you use one of the patch
;overlays for a specific hardware configuration.

;This file now also includes the Hoff patches for BELL and RUB
;and can be conditionally assembled for the way you want it.

;CHECK TO SEE IF YOUR MDM730.COM ALREADY HAS THESE BYTES CHANGED.

;Options below are by Irv Hoff modified for inclusion in this
;patch overlay file by Bob Plouffe:

;     Some people have mentioned they are annoyed with the bell ringing
;constantly after a connect when auto-dialing with MDM730.  The following
;two small changes will stop that:

;
;1) WILL ONLY RING ONE TIME then go to terminal mode after announcing it
;   has connected:

	IF	ONERING
	ORG	06EAH
	DB	0C3H,7EH,19H
	ENDIF

;2) WILL NOT RING AT ALL, but go right to terminal mode after announcing
;   it has connected.

	IF 	NORING
	ORG	06E3H
	DB	00,0CEH,73H,19H
	ENDIF



;     Several people were having trouble getting normal backspace with
;their rub (delete) key.  MDM730 offers the option of changing rub to
;backspace.

;	1)  Can preset the default option so rub comes up as backspace
;		(or preset the default so it comes up as normal rub)
;	2)  At any time use the menu option to change it temporarily
;		to the opposite configuration.


;     Some mainframes will not accept a normal backspace and require a
;rub (delete) character to provide a type of "forward backspace".  If
;you need this feature and your terminal does not have a rub (delete)
;key, or if inconvenient to use, then set BKSP2RUB to TRUE

	IF	BKSP2RUB
	ORG	1629H
	CPI     7FH	;RUB
	;	....
	ORG	1635H	
	MVI     A,08H	;BCKSPC
	ENDIF

	IF	NOT BKSP2RUB
	ORG	1629H
	CPI	08H
	;	....
	ORG	1635H
	MVI	A,7FH
	ENDIF

;     (The menu will still indicate you are changing rub to backspace,
;ignore this statment and realize just the opposite is happening with
;this change.)           - Irv Hoff

Jesse - You have said it very well.  I agree totally.  This private feud is
embarrassing.  Furthermore, several instances of "look how so-and-so messed
things up", followed shortly thereafter by "golly, I guess he didn't, after
all", indicate (to me, at least) more reactionism than conscientious thought.

     It IS a hell of a program, and all of the shenanigans we've been seeing
lately do a dis-service to those who have put so much of their time and effort
into making it so.  Prominent in that list of people are, of course, the
current combatants.  It's saddening.

I am using modem7 on apple cpm. My version of mdm707 works with emacs
specifying a DM1520 (datamedia), the microsoft software is set up for
a dm1520 and I am using a videx card.  MDM727 using overlay m7ap-2 set up
for SSC card no longer works as DM1520.  Is there an option I missed.
    Also, if any EMACS gurus know why I can use the DM1520 at 300 baud but
at 1200 emacs says terminal height and width may cause problems. And then proceeds to fill screen and then write an additional 24 lines at the bottom line. 
It seems to think I am 48 lines high.

Thanks,

There are 3 new utilities on SIMTEL20 in MICRO:<CPM.TOPS20>

COM8.EXE (source in COM8.MID)
 Converts binary files from SIMTEL20 (i.e. so called "ITS" or "COM" format)
 to a more traditional Tops-20 8-bit binary format.  Do @COM8<cr> for
 instructions.
 
8COM.EXE (source in 8COM.MID)
 Converts Tops-20 8-bit binary files to the COM file format.  Do @8COM<cr>
 for instructions.

DE-LBR.EXE (source in DE-LBR.MID)
 Breaks up a CP/M .LBR file into its member files.  Do @DE-LBR<cr> for
 instructions.
 Note: This file requires MACSYM.MID (available in MICRO:<CPM.TOPS20> or
 [MIT-MC] MIDAS;MACSYM >) to assemble -- while assembling you should get a
 message saying something like "LIB:MACSYM.MID file not found, use what
 name instead?", at which point you should specify the name using the
 actual directory you FTP'ed MACSYM.MID to.

All the programs are in Midas, and can be assembled with @MIDAS filename<cr>,
or you can just FTP the .EXE files.
Bug reports on any of these can be sent to me -- GZ@MIT-MC.

I too have been trying to use emacs (Gosling derivative from UniPress on
VMS) with mdm720. When I turned on the capture option to see what was
received, it became apparent that in terminal mode, mdm720 was eating
the escape characters that emacs was sending to do things like cursor
positioning and so forth. I verified this with a DUMB program that just
took characters verbatim and shoved them from the keyboard to the modem,
and the modem to the screen. Emacs then worked the way it was set up to,
i.e. the escape characters were coming through. Does this match other
people's experience? Does anybody know where the gobbling is happening?
how to enable/disable said gobbling?

There is an option byte in all the MDM7xx overlays which allows you to
"filter out" all control characters below Line Feed.  That's nice for
eliminating phone line noise-induced garbage, but plays havoc with
cursor addressing when using mainframe video-oriented text editors.
Turn the option off in your overlay and things will work right again.

there is a control both in the overlay and also when you change the
baudrate to enable passthru of control characters or just those which
have normal meanings (cr, lf, bs)...  this should be changed and then
saved or reassembled.  i did this (it took a LONG time to actually
figure it out -- every so often i would change baudrates to get  on the
system and it would mysteriously work.  after a while i put 1+1+1+1..+1+1
together and got the correct answer...)
hope this helps.

Check your overlay for a

	IGNORCTL DB YES

about address 11DH, and change it to

	IGNORCTL DB NO

then re-overlay the COM file.

MDM7xx assumes that you are using a dump terminal (TTY) and that you
do not want to see extra characters generated by signal line noise.
Thus the "IGNORCTL DB YES" flag does not display characters higher
than control-M in the ASCII table when you are in terminal mode.

"IGNORCTL DB NO" should be set if you are using MDM7xx to communicate
with a remote computer that drives your microcomputer console
directly.

Subject:  New Pascal Users List

Hi,

Now that Turbo Pascal is becoming fairly widespread, there has been a
fair amount of mail about it on info-micro and info-cpm.  I would like
to know if there is enough interest in NetLand to start an info-pascal
list.  After all, Ada, LISP, and Prolog all have their own lists, so
why shouldn't Pascal (no flames, please!) ??  Turbo may be the driving
force, but there was a recent discussion on generating random numbers
in Pascal (for JRT) and there are a <lot> of public domain Pascal/Z
files.  The list should not be restricted to micro Pascals only, but
should include whatever implementations people are using.  For example, 
I originally learned Pascal on a Cyber 176 (Pascal-6000) and have used
Pascal-VU, Berkeley Pascal, JRT, MT+, Apple Pascal, and Turbo.  Pascal
is "standardized" enough that a problem that a person has in one
implementation (like the random number generator) may have been solved
by someone else using their implementation.

So all you Pascallers out there, send me your ids and we'll see if we
can get this list off the ground.

We've done it with a Compupro systems support board, without
interrupts, but if you want to run that terminal at any great
speed, you will do better to go to interrupt driven software.
	Or use a hardware protocol for handshaking.

Ken,

There was recently announced on the net a patch for Word* that would let
it look to User 0 for its overlays.  Unfortunately, the patch did not
work on my system for some reason (I haven't had time to really figure
out why).  I have no direct solution either, and commonly use DUPUSR
(a utility that puts the NAME of a desired utility/application into a
User Area, plus pointers to the main source (in User 0), yet does not take
up any actual disk space!  (Except for the directory entry, of course.)

One hazard:  You'd need to carefully caution users of those other User Areas
NOT, repeat, NOT to carelessly erase that DUPUSR'ed file.  It demands a
CTRL C immediately after erasing (e.g., before any disk writes, I believe
is the critical parameter), else it will do a JOB on the entire hard disk
directory!!!

But it is a fix.  I've patched CP/M to look to A0> for all my other
applications, and DUPUSR the overlays to User Areas as needed/desired.

Good luck, and regards.

Subject:  Turbo Pascal Installation

	In contrast to Fred Brundick, who could not make changes to the
Turbo Pascal keyboard stick, I have been able to do that, though not all
changes are possible.  The only reason I can think of that his changes might
not have stuck is if he has made a copy of the Turbo.pas file under another
name as his working copy.  TINST makes modifications directly to the
TURBO.PAS file, rather than recording them in a separate data file as
many configuration programs do.

	The problems I have had appear to result from Turbo's assuming that
all keyboard signals will be control codes or special characters. My
Rainbow (VT-102, essentially) sends codes like <ESC>OP. Fine, that is what
you see, UNTIL you go out of TINST and go back in again. Then it has
strangely changed to <ESC>^O^P!  Apparently the editor does the same 
translation, though, so everything is fine ---

	UNTIL you try and assign keys that send a lower-case letter.
<ESC>Om gets turned into <ESC>O4 (some number, anyhow), and that DOESN'T
work.  Well even this can be worked around: if you send the characters one
by one to TINST as <ESC>OM, that gets understood by the editor. 

	Only trouble with that is that now you have two keypad keys sending
what the editor hears as the same code, because <ESC>OM and <ESC>Om are
attached to two different keys.  So there is a whole row of keypad
keys you can't use, very annoying!

	Furthermore, the manual says (I think, I don't have mine handy at
the moment) that you can have up to four bytes sent by a key.  But it
doesn't seem to accept my keys that send four bytes, and I couldn't find
a work-around.  And of course it doesn't understand the ones that send FIVE at
all.  So I have a whole raft of lovely keys looking at me begging.

	Apparently the designers were so WordStar oriented that they forgot
that there are those of us out here who dislike the WordStar way of doing
things.

	By the way, I too amy very pleased with Turbo Pascal in general.

Subject:  Good editor wanted

	My research group is seeking information about MS DOS editors, with
some interest in CP/M.  At the moment I am using Final Word under CP/M on
a DEC Rainbow.  If I cannot find anything better, I will purchase that for 
MS DOS.  I am very happy with the multiple buffering and windowing 
capability, and reasonably happy with the commands.  All your work is saved
on the disk so that you cannot lose much in the event of a power failure, a
major plus. 


	I would very much like to have the capability to define macros, and
it would be convenient to be able to reassign keys directly from the
editor.  The other problem with Final Word is that it sometimes gets its
buffer pointer mixed up unless your are careful about not leaving multiple
buffers around when you exit. Cleaning up when you leave is a minor
nuisance, but can be put up with. 

	I have looked at the VEDIT manual, don't like its philosophy, and 
see that you can only edit in the main buffer.

	So, guys, what is there out there that has multiple buffering with
the ability to edit equally well in any buffer, at least two windows,
reassignable keys (at least at configuration time and preferably at edit
time) that understand the VT-102 keyboard, preserves a record of current
actions on the disk, and has macro capability? 

	And preferably it shouldn't cost an arm and a leg.

	I will summarize replies to the net.

Subject: ZCPR3 Intro
To: info-cpm@BRL.ARPA

	In all of my excitement during the past several months, I have
been making references from time to time on the creation of ZCPR3.  ZCPR3
is now well underway, and beta testing by a volunteer test group out
in Silicon Valley will begin in the next few days.

	ZCPR3 is not yet complete, but it is quite operational in terms of
its major features.  Only one minor bug with 8-character passwords
exists at this time (to my knowledge), and I am using it daily now in
5 different versions (2 different versions for software development, each
version on a different machine, 2 applications-oriented versions running
dBASE II and Multiplan, and one RCP/M version).

	I have received a lot of interest and support from a number of
people and groups in this project, and, to satisfy your own curiosity
and answer many of the questions I have been receiving, I have
prepared ten messages (not counting this one) which will be transmitted to
INFO-CPM today on the subject of ZCPR3.  For those of you not interested,
each message will reference ZCPR3 and a message number in the subject line,
so you can flush it without reading it.

	The first message is an introduction to ZCPR3 which simply states
an outline of the contents of the following messages.  It is not detailed
at all.  Each of the following 9 messages concentrates on one topic area
of ZCPR3.  Live terminal sessions are included in these messages to illustrate
by example the concepts discussed.  You are invited to study these messages,
and I believe many of your questions will be answered.  For those of you
who want to know even more, I will be providing a service (for a brief time)
which I haven't tried before.

	Sometime within the next two weeks, I will be bringing a ZCPR3
remote access system online.  When it comes up, I will post the phone number
and access code to the net with some instructions on its use.  You will be
invited to log onto it and try out the demonstrations prepared on it.
There will also be an electonic mail facility which you may use to send me
comments and suggestions, etc.  The tenth message which follows is an
example of a "secure" ZCPR3 system, and the remote access system you will
be using will support features very similar to the "secure" system you see
discussed in the 10th message.

	For those who have even more interest in the topic, I will be speaking
on ZCPR3 at the Trenton Computer Festival on Saturday, April 14 at 11:00AM.
This presentation will be more of an overview in nature, but the
opportunity to ask technical questions will present itself.  Also, there
will be a closed meeting of RCP/M SYSOPs at the festival, and I'll be giving
a brief talk on the use of ZCPR3 for RCP/M application for those of you invited
to this meeting.

	Enjoy the time to come!

Subject: ZCPR3 Intro - Message 2: Directories
To: info-cpm@BRL.ARPA


                       ZCPR3 - Directories

               Under ZCPR3, a logical disk can be thought of 
         to  contain two types of directories.   One is  the 
         physical directory,  which is usually located  just 
         after  the  system tracks on  most  floppies.   The 
         other is the logical directory,  in which each file 
         on  a  disk  has a user number associated  with  it 
         (from 0 to 31),  and the combination of a disk  and 
         user   number   identifies  uniquely  the   logical 
         directory in which the file belongs.   DDT.COM  may 
         be located on disk A,  user 5,  while two copies of 
         ED.COM may be located on disk A, user 5 and disk A, 
         user 0.   The combination of the disk reference and 
         user  number identifies the logical directory which 
         a file belongs in.

               Under ZCPR3, the logical directory is usually 
         indicated as part of the prompt.   In the  examples 
         below,  the  reader  can see the logical  directory 
         referred  to by its disk and user  number  and,  in 
         most cases,  by a name associated with the disk and 
         user number.  The following examples illustrate the 
         use  of  the  DU  (disk/user)  form  and  the   DIR 
         (directory  name)  form  to log into  various  user 
         areas and directories.

A0:BASE>15:
A15:ROOT>4:
A4>b:
B4:WORK4>0:
B0:WORK1>a14:
A14>a0:
A0:BASE>root:
A15:ROOT>work2:

               Additionally,  commands may use either the DU 
         or  DIR form to reference the  logical  directories 
         they  are to act upon.   Interpretation of the name 
         of  a  directory is built into  the  ZCPR3  command 
         processor  itself,  so every command can work  with 
         the DU and DIR forms with equal ease.

               It should be noted that commands,  like WS or 
         DBASE,  which  don't know about the DU or DIR forms 
         will  usually  just  pay  attention  to  the   disk 
         referenced  and not the user number.   For commands 
         like these,  it is usually best to just employ  the 
         disk letter when referring to their arguments.

B1:WORK2>dir base:
 RHEX    .COM    2 
            A0:BASE --     1 Files Using     2K (  206K Left)

B1:WORK2>base:

               The  PWD  command  under ZCPR3  displays  the 
         names  and associated DU forms of  all  directories 
         which   currently  have  names  assigned  to  them.  
         Additionally, when using the DIR form to log into a 
         directory (see PRIVATE below), a directory so named 
         may have a password associated with it.  If so, the 
         user is prompted for this password and the  command 
         will  fail  if  he  does not  provide  the  correct 
         password.

                ZCPR3 - Wheel Users and Passwords

               As the reader has seen,  password  protection 
         is common under ZCPR3.  To be exact, several of the 
         ZCPR3  utilities  respond  one way if the  user  is 
         priveleged  (a Wheel) or not  priveleged.   A  user 
         becomes priveleged by running the WHEEL command and 
         giving the Wheel Password.

               As  another part of the  protection  afforded 
         under  ZCPR3,  if a user knows the right  passwords 
         and   has  the  proper  Wheel  privelege,   he  can 
         radically change the directory structure,  bringing 
         new  directories  which were  previously  undefined 
         into existence.

               Under  ZCPR3,  the  ability  to  log  into  a 
         directory can be controlled by the  installer.   At 
         installation time, the ability to allow the user to 
         use DU and to use DIR forms to log into directories 
         or reference directories can be established.   On a 
         more secure system, for example, the ability to use 
         the DU form may be denied.   Then, only directories 
         defined by name may be accessed (DIR form), and, if 
         these  directories  have passwords associated  with 
         them, the proper passwords must be given.

Subject: Re: Aztec CII I/O Redirection (Reposted with new info)
Article-I.D.: azure.2640

(Reposting)
 
The problem of slow redirected I/O  in Aztec C is caused  by
I/O  being  unbuffered. This causes each byte of output that
is redirected to a file to be written seperately (Read  sec-
tor, place byte, write sector). No wonder is so slow.
 
The solution I've been using is simply changing  the  unbuf-
fered  I/O  into  buffered I/O. I've also added a few exten-
tions  which  are  "2>"  (redirect  stderr),  "2>>"  (append
stderr) and ">>" (append stdout).
 
To implement the fix find the file called "CROOT.C"  in  the
source   to  your  library.  It  contains  a  function  call
"Croot()".  Replace the while loop that starts  with  "while
(Argc < MAXARGS)" with the following--
 
 
        while (Argc < MAXARGS) {
                while (*cp == ' ' || *cp == '')
                   ++cp;
                if (*cp == NULL)
                   break;
                k = -1;
                switch (*cp) {
                   case '>':
                        if (*(cp+1)=='>') {
                           ++cp;
                           k = 1;
                        } else
                           k = 1;
                        break;
                   case '<':
                        k = 0;
                        break;
                   case '2':
                        if (*(cp+1)) == '>') {

                              k = 5;

Subject: ZCPR3 Intro - Message 5: Command Processing
To: info-cpm@BRL.ARPA


                   ZCPR3 - Command Processing

               When  a  ZCPR3  user  issues  a  command,  an 
         involved sequence of tests and steps takes place in 
         order to identify that command and execute it.

               This sequence is outlined briefly:

                    1) the command is parsed; the first word 
         in  the command line (or subline if semicolons  are 
         used  to  place  several commands on one  line)  is 
         taken to be the name of the command

                    2)  ZCPR3 checks to see if this  command 
         is  a Flow Command (IF/ELSE/FI/XIF),  and,  if  so, 
         ZCPR3 runs the command

                    3)  ZCPR3  then  checks to  see  if  the 
         current  IF condition is TRUE;  IFs may  be  nested 
         eight  levels deep under ZCPR3;  if the current  IF 
         condition is TRUE, ZCPR3 continues, else it flushes 
         the command and goes on to the next command

                    4) continuing,  ZCPR3 then checks to see 
         if  the  command  is built into the  ZCPR3  Command 
         Processor itself; if so, ZCPR3 runs the command

                    5)  ZCPR3  then  checks to  see  if  the 
         command is built into the current Resident  Command 
         Package (RCP); if so, ZCPR3 runs the command

                    6) ZCPR3 then searches along a series of 
         directories  indicated by a command-search path for 
         a  COM file with the same name as the  command;  if 
         found, ZCPR3 loads the COM file and runs it

                    7) finally,  if all of the above  fails, 
         ZCPR3  invokes  an  error handler  or  an  extended 
         command  processor  to  process the command  as  an 
         error or to try to resolve it further

               Let's look at some examples:

               And,  of  course,  let's start to think about 
         command files and command file  processors.   Under 
         ZCPR3,  ZEX, a memory-based command file processor, 
         is designed to be the principal tool used.


B1:WORK2>NOTE ZEX is the command-file processor, memory-based
B1:WORK2>NOTE   Under ZEX, there is a GOTO command which works
B1:WORK2>NOTE   in conjunction with IFs to provide looping capability

               Here  is an actual run of a ZEX command  file 
         (DEMO.ZEX), illustrating looping:

                     ZCPR3 - Error Handlers

               Under  ZCPR3,  Error  Handlers  are  programs 
         which  handle command line errors in a "nice"  way.  
         They  may  be used anywhere,  including within  ZEX 
         command files.  A few examples:

B1:WORK2>NOTE There are a number of error handlers on this system:
B1:WORK2>dir root:error?.com s
 ERROR1  .COM    2r| ERROR2  .COM    4r| ERROR3  .COM    2r| ERROR4  .COM    2r
             A15:ROOT --     4 Files Using    10K (  204K Left)


               Error Handlers are installed by simply giving 
         their name.

B1:WORK2>error4
ERROR4, Version 1.0
 Error Handler Installed

B1:WORK2>NOTE ERROR4 is a simpler error handler
B1:WORK2>NOTE with the invalid command "XXXX";xxxx

B1:WORK2>NOTE ERROR4 simply says what happened


               Error  Handlers  may  vary  in  features  and 
         complexity.   ERROR1  is one of the  more  complex.  
         ERROR2, by the way, is a screen-oriented version of 
         ERROR1,  using reverse video and cursor addressing.  
         See the section on Z3TCAP later for more details.

To: info-cpm@BRL.ARPA


                         ZCPR3 - Aliases

               Aliases  are COM files created by  the  ALIAS 
         command  which  contain one or more  command  lines 
         which  are  invoked when the Alias name  is  typed.  
         Parameter  passing into the command lines within an 
         Alias  is supported in a manner similar to  command 
         file parameter passing.   Aliases are convenient to 
         create  command scripts which are used  repeatedly, 
         and the special commands,  such as STARTUP (used on 
         cold boot to run a series of programs to initialize 
         the system), are created as Aliases.

To: info-cpm@BRL.ARPA


                         ZCPR3 - Shells

               ZCPR3  Shells are front-ends which provide  a 
         user interface in place of the normal ZCPR3 prompt.  
         To  illustrate the concept,  the following terminal 
         sessions show the MENU and SH shells in action.


B1:WORK2>NOTE Shells are Front-End Processors which can run in place
B1:WORK2>NOTE   of the ZCPR3 Command Processor
B1:WORK2>NOTE Actually, the ZCPR3 Command Processor is still being
B1:WORK2>NOTE   used, but it is transparent to the user now
B1:WORK2>NOTE Two shells I am going to demonstrate now are MENU and
B1:WORK2>NOTE   SH:

B1:WORK2>dir root:menu.* a;dir root:sh*.* a
 MENU    .COM    4r
            A15:ROOT --     1 Files Using     4K (  204K Left)
 SH      .COM    4r| SHDEFINE.COM    4r| SHFILE  .COM    2r| SHOW    .COM    4r
 SHVAR   .COM    4r
            A15:ROOT --     5 Files Using    18K (  204K Left)

B1:WORK2>NOTE The MENU shell consists of only MENU.COM
B1:WORK2>NOTE The SH shell is SH.COM, but can use SHDEFINE, SHFILE, and SHVAR
B1:WORK2>NOTE   for support
B1:WORK2>NOTE First, MENU:

B1:WORK2>ed menu.cpr

SH Commands --
  ?         SHCMT     SHECHO    SHEXIT  

B1:WORK2; all commands work that way under SH
B1:WORK2; as I mentioned, SH is a Variable Shell
B1:WORK2; by this I mean that it supports named variables, which
B1:WORK2; can be defined (in groups) by SHDEFINE or one at a time
B1:WORK2; by SHVAR
B1:WORK2; 
B1:WORK2; SHVAR with no args displays the names of the current
B1:WORK2; variables
B1:WORK2; !shvar
SHVAR, Version 1.0
 Shell Variables --
  -- No Variables Defined --


B1:WORK2; 
B1:WORK2; with an arg (actually, 2 args), SHVAR defines variables
B1:WORK2; !shvar file1 myfile.txt
SHVAR, Version 1.0
 Shell Variable FILE1 = MYFILE.TXT
 Writing Shell Variable File SH      .VAR


B1:WORK2; 
B1:WORK2; and now I can reference variables by preceeding them with
B1:WORK2; a % character
B1:WORK2; !type %file1

I have modified MYFILE.TXT
This is MYFILE.TXT
Isn't this fun?

B1:WORK2; does the same as
B1:WORK2; !type myfile.txt

I have modified MYFILE.TXT
This is MYFILE.TXT
Isn't this fun?

B1:WORK2; note that SH variables can only be used under SH
B1:WORK2; don't confuse these with aliases, which can be used
B1:WORK2; anywhere, including under SH
B1:WORK2; !alias
ALIAS, Version 1.0

 Input Alias (RETURN to Abort)
 --> echo hello, world - my name is $0
 Name of ALIAS Command (RETURN to Abort)? hello

B1:WORK2; !hello

B1:WORK2>hello

B1:WORK2>sh
Shell Installed

B1:WORK2>> shcmt
B1:WORK2; also, SH variables can be referenced by other SH variables,
B1:WORK2; up to 20 levels deep:
B1:WORK2; !shvar cmddemo type %%file1
SHVAR, Version 1.0
 Shell Variable CMDDEMO = TYPE %FILE1
 Writing Shell Variable File SH      .VAR

B1:WORK2; note my use of the double %% to indicate that I wanted
B1:WORK2; the % character substituted -- If I used just 1 %, then
B1:WORK2; the value of the variable would be substituted:


B1:WORK2; !shvar cmddemo1 type %file1
SHVAR, Version 1.0
 Shell Variable CMDDEMO1 = TYPE MYFILE.TXT
 Writing Shell Variable File SH      .VAR

B1:WORK2; see the difference?
B1:WORK2; so, to execute:
B1:WORK2; !%cmddemo

I have modified MYFILE.TXT
This is MYFILE.TXT
Isn't this fun?

B1:WORK2; !%cmddemo1

I have modified MYFILE.TXT
This is MYFILE.TXT
Isn't this fun?

B1:WORK2; as a side comment, the SHECHO command can be used to make
B1:WORK2; SH show you the command line it is generating:
B1:WORK2; !shecho
 Echo of Shell Commands is ON

B1:WORK2; !%cmddemo
TYPE MYFILE.TXT

I have modified MYFILE.TXT
This is MYFILE.TXT
Isn't this fun?

B1:WORK2; Now, if I change the definition of FILE1:
B1:WORK2; !shvar file1 hisfile.txt
SHVAR FILE1 HISFILE.TXT
SHVAR, Version 1.0
 Shell Variable FILE1 = HISFILE.TXT
 Writing Shell Variable File SH      .VAR

B1:WORK2; the meaning of CMDDEMO is different:
B1:WORK2; !%cmddemo
TYPE HISFILE.TXT
 No Files

B1:WORK2; while CMDDEMO1 remains unchanged
B1:WORK2; !%cmddemo1
TYPE MYFILE.TXT

I have modified MYFILE.TXT

B1:WORK2; !ed %file1

               Finally,  with  password protecton and  named 
         directories  (DIR  form) built  into  ZCPR3,  ZCPR3 
         offers  a much more secure environment  than  CP/M.  
         In particular, if the DU form is disabled, the only 
         directories  a  user  can access are those  he  can 
         name,   and   some  of  those  may  have   password 
         protections on them.

                         ZCPR3 - Z3TCAP


               The ZCPR3 TCAP (Terminal Capability) Facility 
         (Z3TCAP)  allows ZCPR3 to have a variety of easily-
         transportable screen-oriented  utilities.   ERROR2, 
         VFILER,  SHOW,  and  VMENU are such utilities found 
         under the ZCPR3 System.


B1:WORK2>NOTE The ZCPR3 TCAP (Z3TCAP) facility is supported by
B1:WORK2>NOTE   three programs and one data file:
B1:WORK2>dir root:tc*.com a;dir root:*.tcp

            A15:ROOT --     3 Files Using    12K (  202K Left)
 Z3TCAP  .TCP    8r
            A15:ROOT --     1 Files Using     8K (  202K Left)

               Forty-three   (yes,    43!)   terminals   are 
         currently  supported  under  the   Z3TCAP.    Their 
         selection  and installation into a ZCPR3 System  is 
         rather trivial:

Tony Pietsch is no longer recommending Dysan disks (we used
nothing else for years) since their big plant expansion.  We
have had several bad batches of Dysans.  alas.  We have not yet
selected a new brand.  Maxell perhaps?

      AN INTRODUCTION TO ZCPR3 FROM THE USER'S PERSPECTIVE

                         by Richard Conn




     The  ZCPR3 System is a collection of programs  based  around 
the  ZCPR3  Command Processor.   Forming an integrated system  of 
tools,  the  ZCPR3  System  offers a  number  of  convenient  and 
sometimes  more  user-friendly  features to the  CP/M  2.2  user.  
Maintaining  CP/M  2.2  compatibility  at all  times  (all  known 
commercial   CP/M   2.2   programs  run   under   ZCPR3   without 
modification),  the ZCPR3 System brings to its users a variety of 
tools  which  conceptually  implement  features  found  in  other 
operating  systems,  including TOPS-20 (1),  UNIX (2),  NOS  (3), 
MULTICS  (4),  and VMS (5),  and tools which  implement  features 
unique to the ZCPR3 System (to my knowledge).

     This  Introduction  is intended to outline some of  the  key 
features  of the ZCPR3 System from the user's perspective.   More 
complete technical details of implementation and use will  follow 
later.   Knowledge  of CP/M 2.2 is assumed,  and some  experience 
with  ZCPR2  is  useful,  in order to  uion  is intended to outline some of  the  key 
features  of the ZCPR3 System from the user's perspective.   More 
complete technical details of implementation and use will  follow 
later.   Knowledge  of CP/M 2.2 is assumed,  and some  experience 
with  ZCPR2  is  useful,  in order to  understand  the  following 
presentation  in detail.   The major features of the ZCPR3 System 
which are described in this Introduction include:


          o Directories       o Wheel Users and Passwords

          o Command Lines     o Command Processing
                                   o Resident Command Packages
                                   o Flow Command Packages
                                   o ZEX Command Files

          o Error Handlers    o Aliases

          o Shells            o Z3TCAP
               o Variable          o Screen-Oriented Terminal
               o MENU                   Configuration
               o VFILER

A little while ago there was some messages relating to a patch you could
make to Wordstar to remove the copyright junk at the beginning of the program.
The supposed advantage was that Wordstar would come up more quickly.

Anyway, I didn't pay attention to the messages and I now would like to make
those patches.  Can someone out there in netland tell me what patches
are necessary?

Thanks,

Subject: DISKPLOT programs now available

From: Bob Bloom (TECOM) <bbloom at brl>
To:   w8sdz

DISKPLOT is a MBASIC translation of the diskplot routines from the
December 1983 Byte "A dragon meets a tiger" with three example programs,
messages i've received about it, and a short doc file.

DISKPLOT as uploaded works ok on my system - vanilla cp/m, terminal,
IDS microprism printer.  Routines included are plot a line or point,
and open, close, and print a file.  I am working on version 2 which
will include draw axis, scaling set-up and scale befor plotting,
and plot a circle.  But my work habits are bad so it might be awhile...

-Bob Bloom

These files are now available on SIMTEL20 in the MICRO:<CPM.DISKPLOT>
directory.  Please note that the files are squeezed (stored in
ITS-Binary format).  They were left this way to preserve MBASIC's
special LF-CR end-of-line for "continued lines".

MP/M allows .OVR a/o .OVL files to be shared under user 0 if you set the F1
(and if necessary, F2, F3, and F4) file attributes.  I don't know that this
can be done with STAT, so a user-written utility would be necessary, even
if this were allowed under "CP/M 2.5".

Subject: IBM-PC Communications Program
Reply-To: PLK@Mit-Mc.ARPA

Thanks to Paul Kelly <PLK@MC>, the following files are available on
SIMTEL20 in the MICRO:<CPM.IBM-PC> directory:

PCCOMM11.COM
PCCOMM11.DOC
PCCOMM11.HEX

PCCOMM is an asynchronous communications program for the
IBM-PC operating PC-DOS. It has the following features:

	1. Menu driven
	2. Interrupt operated
	3. Supports the Christensen protcol
	4. Optional H19 terminal emulation
        5. Online reconfiguration of communications parameters
	6. Optional local status line

	The DOC file expains how to change the initial configuration
with DEBUG. The ASM source will be released as soon as comments are
added.

	The program has only been tested with an IBM monochrome
monitor. I would appreciate bug messages and suggestions. Note that
the HEX file is in the PC hex format, not the Intel (CP/M) hex
format.

I seem to have a problem with the new QK. If I try to run SD79 or
XD3 (under ZCPR2) they both fail to work. Under QK12, I had no problem.
It appears that all I get sent to the screen from SD79 when called
by a QK20 re-defined key is a CR-LF, and Ctl-C does not abort, I must
reset the system. Any clues?

	Has anyone tried any of the Apple ][ overlays for MDM7 with MDM730?  I
downloaded both M7AP-2 and M7AP+3, and after a brief edit I combined them with
MDM730, only to produce a non-working MDM730.  The last MDM7 I assembled was
MDM716, but I did not have any problems then.  The terminal emulation seems to
be going haywire, with continuous chracters from (probably) some random memory
location.

Reply-To: Anderson <Anderson.es@Xerox.ARPA>

This is to announce a new distribution list for the purpose of
discussing issues and exchanging ideas pertaining to VLSI Computer Aided
Design and Layout.

I hope for this DL to encompass a broad range of topics including but
not limited to: VLSI CAD/CAE/CAM hardware, software, layout, design,
techniques, programming, fracturing, PG, plotting, maintenance, vendors,
bugs, workstations, DRC, ERC, system management, peripheral equipment,
design verification, testing, benchmarking, archiving procedures, etc.
etc.

The distribution list itself resides on the Xerox Ethernet.  Ethernet
users can send messages to CADinterest^.es.  Arpanet, Milnet, Usenet,
and other Internet users can send messages to CADinterest^.es@PARC-MAXC.

Anyone on the Xerox Ethernet may add themselves using Maintain.
Arpanet, Milnet, Usenet, and other Internet users should send a request
to me (Anderson.es@PARC-MAXC) and I will add you to the DL.  I will also
add whole DL's if requested by the owner.

The people in the cc: section of the header are already on the DL.
Following is a type out of the DL entry.

For now, there are no rules set for this DL.  Depending on how large it
gets, I hope to keep it as anything goes and see what happens for a
while.  I will wait a week before sending any messages to the DL in
order to allow people to be added to the DL.  If we get some good
informative discussions going, I will try to archive the responses or
maybe go to a digest format.  Thank you for your indulgance.

NSWP version 2.00 allows changeing any of the F1,2,3, or 4 bits.
Among other things...

(NSWP [NEWSWEEP] is a file maintenance utility like SWEEP, DISK, VFILER,
CLEANUP, etc.  It is the best one I've seen by far - version 2.00 even
has a built in squeezer/unsqueezer!  And all this for $0.00 and ~11k!!
It should show up on simtel20 soon ...)

Setting any of these bits means nothing to cp/m 2.2 by definition - 
they are left for the user to define.  f5,6,7 and 8 are reserved by DR
for purposes unknown by me.  I know not what would happen if they are set.
