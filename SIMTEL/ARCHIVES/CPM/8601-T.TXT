Does anyone have and experience or information about Ecosoft's C
compiler for the Z80s?

I'd be using it on an Apple ][+, under PCPI CP/M 2.2.

Thanks!

I've spoken to Martin Murray about coming out with a version of NULU
which is Z3-specific, and he expressed interest in doing so.  I just
finished writing "ZCPR3: The Libraries", and once this is published I'll
try to get Martin a copy of the book and the source code so he can use
same to do the development.

    Keith, are you aware of any bulletin boards anywhere that support
both ASCII and Baudot code?

     I know of one in southern Maryland run by a Dick Barth... thats
the HEX (for Handicapped Educational eXchange) machine.  It supports
ASCII at 300 baud *and* 45.45 baud Baudot code.  His machine, build a
couple of years ago from a Gov't grant, has quite a population of
hearing-impaired and blind people using it.

     The Baudot modems aren't anywhere near Bell 103 or 212A; they use
something called a Weibrecht (sp?) standard.  Mark tone at 1400 Hz,
space at 1600 Hz.  Also, they are *half* duplex.

     Please forward this as you see fit - I'm curious if more than one
of these "modified" BBS systems exist.

     Dick's hardware is oriented around a Smoke Signal Broadcasting
frame with a 15 MByte disk attached.

Regards,
Mark

	I have an Apple IIe lookalike, and I am trying to use the full 40
tracks that are available on the disk drives. Microsoft has not made this
especially easy, as they supply neither the MOVCPM utility nor the source
code for the BIOS or BDOS. I beleive that the modification requires only
a change in the system's BIOS to tell it that there are more sectors.
	From the information that I can dredge up, the system was originally 
set up for 35 track drives as the inner 5 were considered unreliable. The 
disk drives that I am using, and the disks I use, are, however, quite good
in this respect, and I want to use the extra 14% or so of disk space (I have
just the application for it....). Microsoft here in Australia have been
singly unhelpful (in fact, as soon as the word "source" was mentioned they
became rather abusive).
	Has anyone out there in Netland attempted this modification? If so,
please send mail to me directly. If anything comes of the responses, I will
post a summarised followup to net.micro.cpm and net.micro.apple .

It has been 8 years since I worked on the BIOS for my
NorthStar Horizon.  I just dug out the code and found that
you have to send the 8251 both a Mode Word to tell it either
Async or Sync and a Command word.  The code for my Horizon
was:
* Send Mode Word for Asynchronous Mode
*
	MVI     A,0CEH  ; 2 Stops, 16XClock, 8 Bits, No Parity
	OUT     3       ; Send to 8251 (This different from Data Port)

* Set up Control Word for 8251
*      
* RTS = Request To Send, ER = Error Reset
* RXE = Receive Enable, DTR = Data Term Ready
* TXEN = Transmit Enable
*
	MVI     A,37H   ; CMD: RTS, ER, RXE, DTR, TXEN
	OUT     3       ; Output to 8251

Hope this helps.

Using PCPI CP/M on an Apple ][+, my Mince CONFGIG program tells me that
the cursor positioning sequence is ESC followed by = , that the cursor
position is to be sent row first, binary, uncomplemented, with a bias of
32 for the rows and 32 for the columns.

I send the console the following hex sequence:

1B 3D 20 20

and the result is not that the cursor homes, but a lower case "s" is
displayed.  Am I interpreting this cursor control definition (SOROC
emulation) correctly?

Thanx,

I have tried to do the same thing on two different machines (one multibus
z80 based and the other an s100 8086 based) and found the same thing you
did.  What seemed to work was sending the initialization sequence twice,
e.g. write a subroutine to set up the 8251 and just call it twice in a
row. I'd be interested to know if this works for you......

If any of you have an Ithaca Intersystems 800 or 500 with an interrupt

and then direct port addressing programs like MODEM7 or KERMIT can be used.

I'm also having a problem with this beast...  I can reset the chip no
problem.... however, it has this "feature" of dropping DTR when I do
so, causing my Hayes 1200 to go on-hook.

Anyone know of a work-around (besides disabling DTR in the Hayes) ?

I have shared your frustration with programming the 8251.  Maybe I can help
some.  First, you must 'kick' the 8251 into a mode where it will recognize
and accept the control byte.  If the board you are using has a hardware
reset facility of some type, that may work.  There is a pin on the 8251
that will physically reset the chip, and put it in a mode where it is
waiting for the control byte.  If your board doesnt have that (many dont),
you must send the 8251 several 'invalid' control bytes, which will get it
into a state where it is expecting the control byte.  I have found that
outputting several bytes of 0 will work.  I have seen some code use 2
zeros, and some use 3 zeros, it may not matter.  Once that has been done,
you set up the chip the way it states in the manual.  Your code looks good,
just add the outputting of serveral bytes of zero to the command port
first. 

Second, I have found several things with the 8251.  Some of the older
ceramic-body 8251 chips are not to be trusted.  I was told and found to be
true that you should stick to the plastic parts.  My ceramic 8251s were at
least 5 years old, so maybe newer ceramic parts are ok.  Also, I found that
some of my 8251s would not work correctly (sorry, I cant remember what
wasnt correct) when you ran them with NO PARITY.

Hope this help.

*** REPLACE THIS LINE WITH YOUR MESSAGE ***

What ROM and Bios Revision levels do you have ?
This makes MEGA-DIFFERENCE. Osborne originally messed with index registers
in version 1.0 of the rom, and neglected to save the IX and IY registers on
the stack in the bios.  Too make a long story shorter, turbo pascal and
others would not run on the machine, and many rumors spread about cpm3 being
incompatible with 2.2 software. Well, a simple rsx (about 8 bytes) inserted
in the system first will fix this trouble (First in, last out) and allow most
software to run.  Most since programs that modify cpm itself of course will
not run at all.  Perhaps this is what is happening with "Write-Hand-Man".
Please reply if you want the rsx source code or find *any* technical errors
in my account of index registers and the ozzy exec.

Hmm, how about that JMP 0? Does your BIOS reset the 8251 and write
"reasonable" MINIT1 and MINIT2 bytes to it on a warm boot? Mine sure
does (SANYO MBC-1000).  I use a routine just like yours but I just
return after calling it.

The fact that I have an AppliCard (which is a co-processor type card
without direct access to the Apple ][ memory) means I can't use the
standard overlays.  Any assistance would be appreciated.  Thanks.

I am running Montezuma Micro CP/M 2.2 on my TRS-80 Model 4P.  Both the
MDM730 that came with it and MEX which I finally got to operate (sort of)
ignore cursor motion codes.  (The only thing I use TRSDOS 6.2 for is my
vt52 emulator.)  If anyone can find a vt100 emulator for CP/M, or even a
program that will let me let escape codes through (this thing already emu-
lates an adm3a right off the bat), I would be very grateful.

I may be naive, but the best place to go to school on any USART is the
overlays for MODEM7 and its descendents.  Go through the documentation
and find one that uses the USART, and download that overlay.  If the overlay
is squeezed and you can't read it, I will download it, unsqueeze it and
mail it to you.

   I have a program called CPM60.COM for my Apple CP/M system that supposedly
updates my 56k CP/M to 60k CP/M.  This program used to work for me, but for
some reason, every time I run it now, I get the message

   Disk space already in use

   Hit RETURN to re-boot system:

...I have a Sider hard disk that uses only 60k CP/M, so I need to get 60k CP/M
on a floppy if I want to reformat the hard disk at any point (I copy the
floppy's CP/M to the hard disk).  At the moment I am stuck with no 60k CP/M
at all.

   Has anyone run into this problemk before?  How do I get around it?

Thanks in advance.

Try pd:<cpm.term>gate.lbr on simtel20.  I haven't tried it yet but the name is
for Generalized Async. Terminal Emulator.  Slow as Kermit is, it does have
a VT52 emulator.  Your machine may be as off the wall as mine (an Ithaca
Intersystems), but I was abe to bash the information from my modem7
overlay into the kermit machine dependent modules in two hairraising nights
so that is a possibility.  Kermit is also handy if you have to access your
mainframe through a local area net which does not permit full 8-bit up-
and down loads.  I use Kermit for work and MODM700 for fun.

If you are using MEX, there is a status flag, FILTER, that can be set to
filter out all the lower non-printable characters.  Be sure to see that the
FILTER is set OFF.

Has anyone written code to do this for ANY of the Apple CP/M
coprocessor cards (MicroSoft Premium SoftCard //e, ALS CP/M Card,
DRI Gold Card, and PCPI/AppliCard).  It would make portability
of certain applications easier, since one could include the
code for your processor when writing programs.

I imagine specs something like the following:

ApplePeek(address: integer) : byte; {Read a byte from Apple memory}

ApplePoke(address : integer, data : byte) {Write a byte to Apple memory}

In MEX there is an equate called FILTER that blocks out ctrl-codes as 
protection from static on the phone lines. If you need to use an editor
or something just turn off the FILTER with the STAT command from the MEX
command line. STAT FILTER OFF will turn it off, and STAT FILTER will
give you the current status of the equate.

                   IMMEDIATE Z-SYSTEM PROBLEMS
                         by Richard Conn

                IF PROBLEM UNDER ZCPR 3.0/3.1/3.2
     As  many of you are aware,  there are various versions of my 
original  FCP floating around (version 1.4 is the latest I  heard 
of).   Somewhere along the way,  Jay Sage decided to reverse  the 
state of the program error flag.  This is a fundamental change to 
the definition in the ZCPR3 Environment descriptor,  and, as many 
of  you  who understand Z-System fundamentals are aware,  such  a 
change can have a ripple-effect over the entire Z-System.  If you 
are going to reverse the program error flag (like Jay did),  then 
you have to CHANGE EVERY PROGRAM WHICH USES THIS FLAG.
     As  you can guess,  I'm rather busy at this time  (like  all 
times,  it  seems),  and I really don't have the time now to scan 
every  program (over 70 programs with ZCPR3,  plus  DISCAT,  plus 
TERM III,  plus ...).   Hence,  Jay's action stands as-is for the 
time  being.   You will find some programs responding to  the  IF 
ERROR flag one way, others another, until I release ZCPR 3.3.  At 
that  time,  because Jay's approach DOES provide more flexibility 
to the system,  the IF ERROR flag will indicate no error if 0 and 
an  error  if  not 0;  if not 0,  the  specific  value  may  have 
significance in further identification of the error.


                        ZCPR3 CPR PROBLEM
     Jay  has  also taken it upon himself to play with the  ZCPR3 
CPR  and  modify  the  Environment  Descriptor  in  other   ways, 
particularly  by  making use of areas I had originally set  aside 
for user (rather than system) definition.   This impacts any user 
programs  which were freely using the user-defined  SYSENV  areas 
(which,  in particular,  impacts some of my plans with TERM III).  
Hence,  be  warned that if you are using Jay's ZCPR3 CPR,  it  is 
possible  that you may find things crashing down if some  program 
comes  in  and  modifies something in the  user-defined  area  of 
SYSENV.

                          GENERAL NOTE
     Both  of these problems reflect the consequences  of  making 
changes to the base of the Z-System itself.   Unlike conventional 
CP/M,  the  Z-System  is integrated with its programs to a  great 
extent.  Any change to a definition in the Environment Descriptor 
has the potential of impacting EVERY PROGRAM, forcing a change to 
be  required to EVERY PROGRAM.   If I had not already begun  work 
and plans on ZCPR 3.3,  I would really have been disturbed by the 
disruption  of the Z-System caused by Jay's actions.   As it  is, 
the creation of ZCPR 3.3 will naturally impact SYSENV,  and I had 
already  planned on making the required changes to EVERY  PROGRAM 
and DOCUMENTING the nature of the change (so that others  writing 
Z-System programs know what to look for).   Now that I am working 
full-time on the Z-System, I plan to keep an eye out particularly 
for  such disruptions in the future and stop them before they  go 
too far (if necessary).

	There are programs offered on sailing simulation, naval design and
other areas through various sailing magazines.
	I purchased a set of so0ftware from Celestial Software.  The set of 5
diskettes pertained to sight reductions, astro bodie locations,
celestial fixes and many other applications and tables pertaining to
Celestial work.  
	I would recommend contacting the OSTAR, PHRF or MORA groups for further
info regarding specific software.  PHRF (Pacific Handicap Racing
Association) in San Francisco would be a good starting point.  I have
some addresses and phone numbers if you are interested in them.  I also
have some software taht I will sell cheap (It was bought for a Hawaaian
trip I made a few months ago but never used at sea).

I have no info on sailing simulation (though it oughtta be an intereting
hack .. lots of vector analysis there, I suppose, and simple yet interesting
graphics potential).

If it's skill-related stuff, I recall some interesting code in one of the
popular magazines (or did I see it in a Public Domain catalog listing
somewhere?) that gives lots of navigational support and utilities.

If THAT's what you're after, yell and I can try to dig out the pointers.

Thanks for all of your help with the 8251.  My problem was with the 
number that I was sending to put the chip back in "normal" mode
after initializing.  I also need a dummy read from the data port after
initializing.  Thanks to mknox@ngp.UTEXAS for sending me the
right number to use.   The following code works fine for me:

MINIT1	EQU	01111110B	;Modem init value for baud, etc
MINIT2	EQU	00110111B	;puts it back in "normal" mode
;               ^^^^^^^^^ this is what I changed

	ORG	100H

INITIALISE:	MVI	A,RESET 	;Puts 8251 in instruction mode

This could be a syntax error...  The first filename given AFTER the photo
command is the name of the file to PUT THE "PHOTO" IN, and LAST comes the
command name to run and it's trail.  I too had problems with this program
where it created zero length "photo" files.  Also all of the programs run
with photo either crashed, or caused my hard disk to become very slow and
make lots of noise for EACH SECTOR read/write until a COLD boot was done!

Subject:  VT100 emulator


Fellow CP/Mers:

I have been looking for a VT100 emulation program for my CP/M system. I
recently downloaded a library called GATE from the Royal Oak RCP/M system.
Gate is a Generalized Asynchronous Terminal Emulator, that is customizable
by way of terminal definition tables.

The version I have is rev 0.85 . The documentation (dated May 6, 1985) refers
to an upcoming version 1.0 .  This is a pretty good, general purpose emulator,
but does not quite meet my needs. It has a built-in ANSI standard terminal
definition. This is not a full VT100 emulation. In particular, it does not
have the aux keypad that the editors on my work computers (VAXen/VMS) need.
I cannot add these because the function key definitions in the table are limited
to ten (I need at least 18).

Also, it is set up for direct port I/O for both the local terminal and the
communications to the remote system. This doesn't work for me because my
system has the display output and the keyboard input on different ports.
What I would like to do is use BDOS calls for console input/output. The
documentation talks about patching in user code for I/O, but the work areas
it points to seem to already have code in them. (Source code was not
distributed with the program.)

My system is an S-100 bus, Z-80 CPU running CP/M Plus (3.0). I use a VDB8024
video display board and a serial keyboard (Keytronics) on a home-built
interface.

Does anyone know of a later release of Gate, or a better terminal emulation
program (either P.D. or commercial, but customizable), or have more information
about customizing GATE ?

Much thanks for any help.

P.S. a plea to software developers - If you are writing CP/M software, please
use the standard BDOS calls for I/O rather than direct I/O or BIOS calls. Also,
if you are distributing public domain software or "freeware", please include
source code.

I recently noticed a request on this mailing list for a version of
kermit to run on the Osborne Executive.  I have an Executive and tried
unsuccessfully to get several different cpm3 'generic' versions to run.
I don't know if my failure was due to equipment bugs in my particular
system, operator error on my part, or what.  In any case I finally got a
'generic' version from simtel20 written in turbo pascal.  That also (of
course) did not run completely on my system.  However, I modified it to
directly address the SIO ports instead of using the built-in AUX port of
the 'generic' versions.  Now it runs just fine.

I would be happy to share it with anyone interested.  I haven't so far
because I thought that maybe I had a flaky piece of hardware and my
problems were unique.

Thank you for all the help with getting MEX to acknowledge cursor motion.
However, under my Montezuma Micro CP/M, all the terminal programs I have
tried have a high amount of data loss.  I am continually losing bytes and
have trouble with cursor motion programs because they will often just
become so much gobbledeygook(sp?) when it loses the escape or the = or
one of the two following characters for cursor positioning.  Furthermore,
it sometimes crashes so that it will do something involving 7s, 's, and
a much smaller screen under something like vi.  Other times it will completely
forget cursor motion works at all.  However, this happens after I've been
in the terminal program for a while.  Does anyone have any idea how to correct
this?  The CP/M is running on a TRS-80 Model 4P and I go 1200BPS.

Cc: sdcsvax!info-pascal@BRL.ARPA

When using CP/M Turbo Pascal to access a modem in slot #2 on an Apple,
input and output is done via the AUX: device (rdr: and pun:).  A simple
program to dial out on a Smartmodem would be:
 
        program dial_out;
        begin
           writeln(aux,'ATDT 555-1212')
        end.
 
This works fine on a CCS-7710 serial card, but NOT on the Videx PSIO card.
The only difference in the serial cards is the CCS uses a 6850 UART, while
the PSIO uses a 6551.  This appears to be a discrepancy with Turbo, as
both cards work fine with MEX and MODEM7.  Any comments?

Does anyone know of a way to patch Mex to allow 8 bit data to be passed
to the terminal.  I would like to have the remote host send graphics
characters to the screen but Mex seems to AND off the 8th bit.  Turning
on DEBUG shows that valid 8 bit graphics characters are being sent but
in normal terminal mode they get stripped.

   I am using SECTION on my system but if I try to log intoan area that is

drive/user.  For example, if I am in A0: and run SECTION to go to an area
that is A3:, I will end up in A0: as the program had never been run.  I
can, however, jump to a user area on a DIFFERENT drive.

   1)  Is there a way around this problem?
   2)  If not, are there any other programs that perform the same function?

   In case my system configuration has anything to do with the problem, I am
running an Apple II+, MicroSoft-compatible CP/M card, and 10M hard disk.  Any
replies would be appreciated.  Thanks.

Hello:

	I am currently attempting to modify Apple CP/M for 40 track drive
operation. I have done this successfully, but to finalise the operation,
I need some software.
	I am wondering if anyone has source for a drive formatter to run
under Apple CP/M, or can advise me on how to modify COPY.COM (a Microsoft
supplied copy utility) to allow me to format 40 tracks.
	Any help would be greatly appreciated. Please mail responses to
keep net goo down to reasonable levels. I will summarise results on the
net.micro.apple and net.micro.cpm newsgroups.

				Thanks,
				Phil Dimond.

Andrew--

	You are probably trying to run it on ZCPR2, right? I had the
same problem when I ran the 8080 version of SECTION on my ZCPR2.
SECTION just quietly exits back to te system without a warmboot, and
that seems to be needed in Z2 for it to change the current d/u msg.
Run SECTION  and then after it exits back to the system hit a ctrl-c
and see if you are where you should be.

	I have a m80 compat SECTION that SHOULD work for you; it
did for me. Good luck...

I am expiriencing trouble with the DRI linker, link. I have converted
my 'C' librarys over to the DRI library format and have been using the
Programers Utilies for quit some time succesfully with the Aztec 'C'
compiler. I have a preprocessor that converts the Aztec assembly output
to a format compatable with rmac.

The problem I am expirencing is trying to produce romable code. When
I try to link my program with my library with out redefining the 
load address, program (code) segment base, data segment base, everthing
works just fine as you would expect. When I try to specify a program
base below 0100H with a load address of 0100H, the linker writes the
whole file out as zeros. real nice huh. I did quit a bit of expermenting
with with diffferent load address and program base address, switching
the order of the parameters in the command line and have come to the
conclution that the linker does not work correctly with program address
addresses below 0100H. If a specify a load address and a program base 
of 0100H (which is the defualt) it creates the .com file OK, but it
forgets to add the jump intruction to the entry point in the code.
If I specify a load address of 0100H and program base of 0103H it
puts the jump intrunction in just fine. 

I was realy disappointed when I found that the linker would'nt ouput
a .hex file ( I need this to dowload to a Data I/O), but I was able to
get a hold of the public domain file comhex.com which solved that problem
(kinda). I would generate a the code to start at 0100H and enter a 
jump to 0100H myself but I will need to add interrupt routines later
and the jump table would also have to be entered by hand. This is
unexecptable. I would also require out how to tell the Data I/O 
to offset the code by 0100H bytes. 

Does anybody out there in netland know if Im doing sothing wrong (I seriously
doubt it), or of linker that works with the DRI .irl files (library file)
and with the microsoft .rel files.

Any help with this matter would be greatly appriciated.

I need to write some software for an Amdahl X.25 Network Administrator
(4404E), which is an 8088-based micro used to control Amdahl PADs in an
X.25 network.  The micro runs CPM, and while we do have a Pascal compiler
available, I'd rather code in C.  

I've never shopped for a C compiler, and have only a vague idea of the
C compilers available that will run on CPM.  I'd certainly appreciate any
advice and information from anyone who has had experience with C compilers 
on a CPM system.

I am looking for a "good" database program to run on my Televideo 1603
under CP/M-86.  Does anyone know of a good program at a reasonable price?
Will any CP/M-86 program run on my machine or does it have to be adapted
for the Televideo 1603?

More questions:

Is there a good book about the internals of CP/M-86?  System calls and
such.

Is there a source of CP/M-86 program titles and a brief discussion of
their function, cost, publisher, etc?

What are other people doing that have CP/M-86 machines?  Write their own
software?  Don't use their system?  Or am I all alone?

Thanks for any help.

Yes, it's NULU.  Only trouble is that NULU has a serious bug and most
RCPM SysOps have deleted it from their systems.  The author knows
about the bug and is working on a fix which, it is said, will be
available in about two weeks.

It turns out that NULU was struck by the infamous BDOS function 37
bug.  More details later.

I have used several C compilers on CP/M and have tried most of the
things you refer to.  All of them produce "com"able code, if you mean
produces a .com file.  I also think all of them require you to go through
and assembler, linker and loader to accomplish this.  If you mean "rom"able,
I know Aztec does it and I think the others will too if you put in the right
ORG statements or whatnot.  There is usually a way even if they didn't design
it in.

1) Aztec.  Expensive at $200, but K&R complete, or more so than most.  Good
library.  Includes its own assembler, linker and librarian.  Slow as mollasses.
I use it because I am familiar with it and didn't want to mess with the
idiosyncrasies of the others (at the time).  No bit fields or preprocessor
macros, but it seems NOBODY has those.  The manual is geared after UNIX (not
a terribly good precedent but OK) which I am sure they developed the language
on.  One of the big plusses about this system is its transportability -- Aztec
makes (virtually) identical compilers for essentially every processor and
operating system.  They even make cross-compilers so you can (for example)
develop on cp/m and run on apple.

2) BDS .  A friend swears by it and it seems fast, efficient and correct.
That is, the compiler seems fast.  I don't know that much about the code
efficiency but he says it is efficient.  $150.  The manual is very good.
No library is as complete as Aztecs, but you can always add your own
library modules to any of these.  BDS was really the CPM C standard
for quite a while, before:

3) C/80 .  for 50$ (might be 60 now) and 20 extra for floating point, the real
bargain in C compilers.  I used an early version of this and didn't like it
because they didn't seem to conform to K&R (at least not the library functions)
and as I was struggling to *learn* the language in the first place, I didn't
want to mess with language variants.  Now, however, it seems to have been
cleaned up significantly.  People seem to love it only second to Turbo pascal,
and amazing things have been written with it.  The people at Software
Toolworks (makers of C/80) have written a lot of stuff with it themselves,
notably MyCalc (best spreadsheet for cpm I have seen; I am told supercalc does
sorts better, but I just like the way MyCalc works.  Amazing that visicalc
made any money at all, considering how limited it was) and Mychess.  Lots of
other people use C/80.  Real nice to have floating point; I think it
comes with Aztec but you might have to pay extra for it.  C/80 is probably
your best bet (at least to get started).

4) Q/C.  The only thing I can say about this is it comes with source code,
written in C.  I don't know how it runs since I've never used it, but if 
you want to know how a compiler is written, this would probably be $95
well spent.  Chances are it is real slow (whereas BDS and C/80 are
written, I believe, in assembly).

What do I prefer?  Well, they all do so many disk accesses, and of
course going in and out of the editor (wordstar) is incredibly time
consuming.  I get very frustrated and am thinking of putting a RAM disk
on my Kaypro with a megabyte (~$450) to speed up *everything*.  But it seems
such a waste for most tasks, which are fast.  I keep hearing rumors about:

5) Turbo C.  Vaporware at the moment, but if it is anything like Turbo P,
it will be worth waiting for.  They may have put all their efforts 
into Modula-2, but we can hope.  I would by Turbo C in a second, and
be off and running.  Failing that, I may just give up the wait and
buy Turbo Pascal.

Here's another C compiler for CP/M.  It's the Small-C compiler which
appeared in Dr.  Dobbs #45 (May 1980), but modified by me to include
floating point.  The compiler requires a Z-80 processor and produces
Z-80 assembly language output.  There's a companion assembler and
linker.  You can get the whole package, including source code in C for
the compiler, as volume 156 from:

	C user's Group
	Box 97
	McPherson KS 67460
	(314) 241-1065

They charge $8 per volume and offer nearly any format.  If you want a
more detailed description, you can look at the September 1985 issue
of their newsletter.

I believe it's also available as SIG/M volume 224.

Credits: Small-C was written by Ron Cain.  The floating point routines
themselves were written by Niel Colvin.  The assembler and linker are
by Bruce Mallett.

(As you can tell, the C User's Group is not-for-profit.  I don't make
any money off this, either.) (I'm not maintaining this code, either. 
I've now moved on to the 16 bit world.)

  I am looking for information regarding the Science Dynamics Corporation OMNI 
5000A computer.  This unit was made by IMSAI,  with IMSAI components,  but was 
marketed by SDC, a division of McDonnell Douglas. I have spoken to the head of 
the technical department there,  Ralph Napolillo, and although they as near as 
I can tell still support them, he claims not to have any information on hand. 
  I  am specifically looking for information on the floppy disk drive package, 
with  2 boards by IMSAI called the FIB and the IFM,  which talk over a  25-pin 
ribbon cable to 2 CalComp 141M disk drives.  The FDC boardset is apparently  a 
DMA-type device,  but we hve not to this date figured out quite *how* to write 
a  CP/M or MP/M BIOS for the above.  Mr.  Napolillo claimed that there was  an 
MP/M  "lying  around somewhere",  but has been unable to provide  any  further 
help,  even to the address of either IMS Associates or CalComp. The system was 
apparently  originally intended as sort of a batch multip;exing type unit  for 
up  to 8 terminals in it's original configuration,  with a modem and a console 
attached  also.   We  would  like to convert these into either  CP/M  or  MP/M 
machines  for club usage,  and so am looking for further info of any kind  for 
our S-100 club here in San Diego. The systems are as follows:

o IMSAI PCS 80/10 cabinet containing the following cards:

     o IMSAI CPA frontpanel
     o IMSAI MPU-A 8080 CPU
     o IMSAI PIC-8 interrupt controller
     o 3) IMSAI 16K RAM boards
     o Microsystems ROM board with a OMNI Problem Executive monitor burned  on 
       it's PROMs-we've decoded it and will probably figure out it's functions 
       in a week or three.
     o 5) IMSAI SIO-2 serial port boards
     o IMSAI FIB  \
                   > these boards hook up, and has it's own 8080 + 2k ROM
     o IMSAI IFM  /

o IMSAI peripheral cabinet containing the following:

     o 2) Calcomp 141M 8" SS disk drives w/ power supplies attached,  some of 
       the jumpers for the drives being on the supplies (?).
     o  a  so-far unnamed board that piggybacks and displays signals  for  the 
        drives.  As  far as we can tell,  the presence or lack of  this  board 
        makes no operational difference.

Would  anyone  having information please post information or send mail to  the 
address  below - the members are willing to *pay* for a reasonable copy  of  a 
working BIOS for any kind of CP/M or MP/M for this system.

               Thanks in advance,

How are you managing your banked ability? I am working on getting my aged IMSAI 
8080 working on a banked configuration, and am looking into ways of doing same.
Is banking only usable through CP/M +, or can you do it through CP/M 2.2, also?
  Derek at seismo!mcvax!ukc!stc!dbmk1 asked something of the same kind, even to
asking how possible it would be to get a banked BIOS massageable to another
machine, and I saw no answer. Consumed by curiousity by the same question, I
wondered the same thing. Is there a BIOS possibly look-at-able, or is it a
matter of machine specifics?

Hi:
	From the responses I have gratefully received from the net, I have
the essential data for modifying Apple CP/M to drive 40 tracks on Apple
drives. I will summarise here. If anyone desires further information, please
do not hesitate to contact me by mail.
	
	Firstly, it is very important to use late model drives. Apple has
advised me that any drives sold since the IIe was released should be capable
of 40 track operation. Any Far-East Apple compatible drives should also
be fine. The problem with old drives is that they cannot step to 40 tracks.
	Now, the only modification that is required is to alter the drive
characteristics contained in the BDOS. These characteristics are held in
the Disk Parameter Block, whose initial address can be found by BDOS function
31. To find this address, enter DDT, and run the following program:

		0100 MVI C,1F	;Load C for function 31.
		0102 CALL 5	;Execute the function.
		0105 RES 7	;On completion, re-enter DDT.

	Now, if the CPU registers are examined, the data in the HL register
should contain the address of the first block of the DPB for the current
default drive. In my 60K Softcard II CP/M the address is FA73 hex for drive
A: .
	Offset five bytes from this are two bytes called the DSM parameter.
These bytes, stored with the low order byte first, give the block number
of the highest block on the disk. In the case of Apple CP/M, there are four
blocks per track, thus for a 35 track drive the highest block number will
be 139 (as the blocks are numbered from zero). We actually have 40 tracks,
so we wish to store 9F hex in this parameter.
	The easy way to do this is to execute the following program. It
will find the DPB for the current default drive, and automatically alter
it's value. The easy way to ensure the disk change is to autorun this 
program on disk boot.


;Modify the DPB to set the current default drive to 40 tracks.
;Written in 8080 assembler for the DR assm assembler.
;
	ORG	0100H 	;Start of Transient Program Area.
;
START:	MVI	C,01FH	;Prepare to call BDOS function 31.
	CALL	5	;Execute the function.
	LXI	D,05H	;Load the parameter offset.
	DAD	D	;Add the offset to the DPB address.
	MVI	B,09FH	;Load the new parameter value.
	MOV	M,B	;Update the DPB.
	RET		;Return to CP/M.
;
	
	A better way is to use one of the multitude of disk editing utilities
that are available in the public domain for CP/M. Edit the system tracks
until you find a copy of the DPB that you see in memory, modify it accordingly,
and you have altered it for good.
	It is at this point that a problem crops up - there is no easily
accessible formatting program available for the Apple CP/M environment that
will format the 40 tracks, at least that I know of.
	Does anyone have one, or even the source to one of uSoft's formatting
programs, or even an idea of how to modify them? It could not be that hard.

	This information was compiled with the help of some reference texts
and several net persons (they know who they are - let me thank them ). A
good reference text is:

Try Fulcrum Computer Products - they advertise in Byte. Fulcrum is run
by one or more ex-Imsai people, and I am pretty sure they have Imsai
BIOS materiial lying around. Another spin-off was Fischer-Freitas, but
I am not sure if they are still in business. Fulcrum advertises in
Byte or Micro/Systems Journal and should be easy to locate.
By the way, Imsai was a different firm from IMS. I believe the latter
is still alive.

Many of the early micro computer 5.25 inch floppy disk systems were
based on the Shugart SA400 "mini floppy" drive. (For a while they were
the only maker ie 1975) This was the original 5.25 inch drive. The SA400
could only have a maximum of 35 physical tracks. If you attempt to step
to a track >34 the CAM follower would lift out of the grove.

Later Shugart updated the drive design to 40 tracks, and 40 tracks has
been standard on 5.25 inch drives for quite a while now. I don't know of
any other companies that make 35 track drives. Shugart drives labled
SA400 are 35 track drives, drives labled SA400L are 40 track drives.
Also some early Shugart SA400's were single density. (I belive before
1977) The only way to tell these is by the serial numbers.

To all those who responded, thank you.  To all those who mentioned
STAT FILTER OFF, I have been running this way since day ONE.  STAT
FILTER OFF controls the passage of data values from 0 to 1F hex. I
have no problem with those.  Values from 80 to FF hex are the
problem.  They come through with the 8th bit reset.  In other words,
ANDed with 7F hex.  I have comfirmed, using a very simple dumb terminal
program, that neither BDOS nor BIOS interferes with 8Bit (0 - FF hex)
data.   There are  20 some AND 7F instructions in Mex.  Without
source it's pot luck but I will try the hard way to determine which
AND 7F is the culprit.

Thanks again to all who responded.  I will post results when they are
available.

Subject:  Need info fast on Diablo, NEC, and other heavy-duty LQ printers

Howdy, fellow netlandians.  I need some quick feedback from the field on
the performance (speed- and print-quality-wise), *reliability*, and
expected maintenance costs for *heavy-duty* letter quality printers, the
kind you would have *no* qualms about using to handle the printing of
many thousands of letters *each week*.  My off-the-cuff analysis says
that ink-jet technology is out (the print image isn't high enough quality),
but if somebody knows something I don't, I'd still like to hear about it.
Laser technology is still in the running, but I have to have print quality
equal to the finest daisy wheel printers.  At the moment, daisy wheel
technology is at the head of my list.  I need at least 80 cps out of a daisy
wheel, with a print head and (probably metal) wheel that can really "go the
distance" in terms of not breaking down or just being plain worn out.  Tractor
feed is almost a must (note "almost" -- that's not "absolute").  (Are there
any laser printers yet that handle a tractor feed?)

The local ComputerLand has a 90cps daisy wheel made by a company called
Primage.  With sheet feeder and tractor it's $2200.  Based on the demo,
(i.e., looking at the construction, listening to it print, "gut feelings"),
I'm not sure it can handle the load.  Does anyone know anything about this
model?  (The salesman says we'd have to replace the print head for $20 after
every 10,000 letters, probably, not to mention the plastic print wheels.)

So if you've got personal experience (or know someone with personal
experience) with a *high-speed*, *heavy-duty*, letter-quality printer, now
is the time to step forward and plug it.  (I'm willing to spend up to $5,000.)
I really need this info, and you'd have my undying gratitude for replying
(isn't that a great incentive?).  Thanks in advance...

There exist several disassembly listings of Apple DOS 3.3; one of which
was distributed on disk by the people who produced the Beneath Apple DOS
book.  It should be pretty easy to modify the INIT routine to count past
35 (you will also have to change the sector skewing table to the CPM
standard -- this is described in Beneath Apple DOS).

I am looking for some information on the Altair S-100 Bus
machine with a Compu-Pro Dual processor board with 8085/8088
processors. I am running CP/M (2.2 I think) in the 8085 mode
which it defaults to.  The 8088 processor, according to the
manual, is sleeping and it doesn't exactly tell how to "wake"
it up.  The manual tells me how to create a file called
tkfxboot.com to be run in 8085 mode to awake the 8088 and boot
an apropriate DOS (ie. my CP/M 86), but it doesn't seem to work.  
If anyone has any advice on either what to do, who to talk to,
or where to look for the answer to this problem I would greatly
appreciate it.  

I am confident that I will eventually find the
answer, so I am also looking for some inexpensive S-100 bus
equipment, in particular a hard drive and more memory (I
currently only have 64k and 4 8" DD drives).

This system was donated to my school (Torrance High,2200
Carson St, Torrance, CA 90501) so if anyone would like to call
in any help (or possibly donate some more equipment) my number
is (213)533-1123; I am only at this number from 2:00pm to 3:00
PDT.

Carl, I have been working on a VT100 emulator for my RS model 4p. Presently
the assembly source code (Z-80) is 46k and when assembled handles all of the
VT100 escape sequences. I have had moderate success with most of the editors
available on the Vax systems here at work. You are welcome to a copy of the
assembled code to try out. Please leave a note (number) and we will get
together and xfer the files. For others that might be interested this code
applies to memory mapped video systems only. Terminals are not supported.
9600 baud is not a problem as the input is buffered during screen operations.

Larry - While none of the lasers I know of support a tractor, I would recommend
any of the Canon engine based machines.  If you really want typeset quality,
then look into Imagen.  Imagen provides a preprocessor to the laser engine.  
The bottom of the line uses the Canon engine, but if you need higher speeds,
then you can move up to one of their Xerox engines.  (We have an Imagen 8/300;
the preprocessor + the Canon engine.  It's really nice.  It also supports
either a serial, parallel or Ethernet interface.)

I also understand that QMS has some nice lasers.

With the kind of output you are talking about, I am not sure that any daisy
type machine will either hold up or produce the amount of output your
talking about.  Also, the general rule "the higher the speed, the higher
the noise" probably applies to the impact printers.  The noisyest thing on
the Canon is the clicking as it pulls the paper thru.

Let me know what you find/decide.

I have a Televideo 920C terminal in excellent working condition which I
would be willing to donate to a legitimate non-profit organization.  The
terminal is about 4 years old, has one extra page of memory, and includes
the original instruction manual.

I have had no luck in selling the terminal through local ads, and hence
am now looking for a tax deduction (for 1986, of course).  Whoever wants
it can have it.  I will NOT arrange for or pay for shipping/delivery.
All I ask of the recipient in return is a letter or receipt on the
organization's letterhead.  The terminal is located in Long Beach (CA).

Message me directly if interested,

Note that not all control key sequences get passed thru by MEX either - it's not
just an eighth-bit problem.  I also would like a patch so that I don't have
to exit MEX to run vi remotely. (or any program with escape sequences/cursor
addressing)

I previously commented on problems with the Courier 2400 modems
communicating with our Racal-Vadic 4401 modems.  After some finger
pointing the problem has been resolved by new firmware in the Courier
2400.  My thanks to the technical support staff at U.S.Robotics and
Racal-Vadic.

After using a Courier 2400 at home for several days I'm very happy
with it.  It has significantly fewer problems with line noise than a
Racal-Vadic 2400PA.

The kaypro (I have a 2x) has this problem also.  Apparently the kaypro
ROM, which performs the terminal functions, repositions the cursor
(which is controlled by the 6845) after every function, and this is
purported to slow the screen down.  Micro Cornucopia has rewritten the
rom for the kaypro to prevent characters from being dropped,
apparently by NOT repositioning the cursor until after all the
characters have been sent (note that although the position where the
characters are to be sent -- which has nothing to do with the cursor
position -- is *apparently* programmed through the 6845 using
registers 18 and 19, there are no registers 18 and 19 on the 6845;
thus the custom chip from kaypro must be listening to writes to these
6845 registers, and must respond accordingly.  Any hints from kaypro
hardware people?).

I have avoided buying the rom and have tried to cope with the problem
by padding the termcap on the vax.  I still seem to run into problems
with gnuemacs when it has 2 windows open and tries to use the
delete-line and insert-line functions (which *really* speed things up
when you are scrolling because then you don't have to do screen
rewrites every time).  

I am thinking of trying to write some sort of fix or terminal emulator
for the kaypro, but I am not sure if this will help because
insert-line and delete-line may require the same amount of time anyway
because of the hardware.  The best way to handle it might be to buffer
the input and "handshake" it into the video, padding timing according
to what screen function is being used (admittedly, this is what the
termcap is supposed to do, but it seems to be failing).  This solution
could be the simplest (in terms of programming) thing to do.

Mex has a related 8 bit problem.

If I am connected to a 7 data bit, even parity host, such as Xerox's own
PARCVAX, I cannot use XMODEM transfers unless I manually reset MEX to 8
bits, no parity.  I have this problem in the PC version of MEX.  I
suspect, but don't know for sure, if this limitation is also present in
CP/M MEX.  

This one deserves a patch.  (Editorial:  That's the trouble with
software provided without source code distribution.)

In response to the recent inquiries regarding 8th-bit display using MEX,
here is a patch and some supplementary information:

For CP/M MEX version 1.14, do "POKE $4822 $0 $0" ... this will delete the code
that zeroes the 8th bit.

For the commercial versions (both CP/M and MSDOS), a patch is impractical,
since there have been several major releases of the program, and an equal
number of minor releases.  As an alternative, we're adding a fixed-position
patch point in all versions, effective with release 1.61, to be released
18 January (we can't unconditionally pass the 8th bit, since many users de-
pend on the parity bit being removed for use with many timesharing
services).  Now that won't automatically fix all those copies out in the
field, so to make it easier to get your copy replaced, we'll waive
the customary $10 update charge, providing:
	1) You return your original distribution disk in a
	   re-useable container
	2) You include return postage.
	3) Mark the package "
	3) Mark the package "Eighth-bit update"

This will also update your software to the recently released version 1.6
(which is a pretty good deal, since 1.6 includes the Kermit and YMODEM
protocols, as well as a bunch of other new features).

One final consideration: someone mentioned that MEX filters some con-
trol characters even when filter is off.  Actually, this is only partially
true: the characters in question are SO and SI (0EH and 0FH) ... these are
the Compuserve protocol start and end-protocol signal characters.  If you
disable Compuserve protocol ("STAT CIS OFF"), MEX will no longer "eat"
these characters.			---Ron Fowler, NightOwl Software, Inc.

The best example that I have of this is contained in the source code to
the public domain program SYNONYM3.  Basically what is done is that the
command line buffer in the CCP is stuffed with the command line to be
executed, the proper length and character position pointer is set and 
control is transferred to the CCP.  This does not work with ZCPR, and can
only be used if the program you are chaining from does not overwrite the
CCP.  Get the source to SYNONYM3 from a BBS or your local user group and
have fun.

The new Courier 2400 ROM is version 243.  Anyone who has an earlier

Subject: FATCAT23 - a buffered multi-disk catalog program

Now available via FTP from SIMTEL20:

Filename			Type	 Bytes	 CRC

Directory PD:<CPM.CATLOG>
FATCAT23.LBR.1			BINARY	161792  DB4AH

FATCAT is a new multi-featured disk cataloging utility for Z80 CP/M
systems.  It was designed with the user's convenience in mind.  It
features rapid-fire insertion of diskettes.  The filenames are simply
appended sequentially to a temporary file.  Then when you are done,
while you go eat supper or watch TV the computer does the tedious work
of sorting, inserting, deleting, etc., without making you share its
tedium.  Also includes LBR file support.  Replaces FMAP, CAT, UCAT,
MCAT, XCAT programs.

Changes from Previous Versions 
 
NOTE -- If you have been using FATCAT version 2.0, please 
READ THIS:
 
NOTE -- Any references to version 2.1 apply equally to version 
2.3.
 
None of the program files in FATCAT vers. 2.0, 2.1, or 2.2 (those 
with file types of .COM, .CHN, .00?) or the Configuration Files 
(.CFG) are compatible with version 2.1.  To avoid needless 
confusion, you should make sure you have backed these files up 
onto an archival disk, and then GET THEM OFF YOUR SYSTEM.  They 
will not work with the version 2.3 files, even though some of 
them have the same names.
 
HOWEVER, ALL actual catalog and index files (.LIX, .RIX, .DNX, 
.LCX, .RCX, and .TCX) from previous versions ARE PERFECTLY 
COMPATIBLE with version 2.3, so there is no need to do anything 
with your actual data files, they will work just fine under 
either version.
 
BUG FIXES
 
Three bugs, are fixed in version 2.3
 
-- A serious bug that caused library files not to be deleted 
properly has been fixed.  This may have caused some corruption
in your catalog files, but not your index files.  To check, 
catalog a disk, note the number of library files reported.  Then 
output all files in the catalog.  If these numbers don't agree 
with the ones obtained previously your catalog file is corrupted.  
Running the <M> option will fix it.
 
-- Searches in OUTPUT mode now give correct results when 
seraching unambigous file names.
 
-- Counts of files now give correct results.
 
Two major bugs were fixed in Version 2.1.
        
-- The add and rename functions in cleanup mode now give full 
access to user areas other than the current one.
 
-- Disk resets have been added in places where disk swapping was
occurring -- causing BDOS errors when run under CP/M.  This was 
not a problem under ZRDOS, which is how it slipped through.
 
ENHANCEMENTS
 
The following enhancement is provided in version 2.3:
 
-- Output now available in a cross-reference format similar to 
XCAT, in addition to the previous FATCAT format.  Accessible from 
new <X> option on main menu or from command line of OUTCAT.
 
The following enhancements are provided in version 2.1:
 
-- The single/multiple mode toggle has been eliminated.  This 
function is now controlled by the Automatic Reindex toggle. 
Leaving this off speeds up the updating process, regardless of 
whether one disk or several have been inserted, and there is no 
automatic update as in former single mode.  What you gain here is 
faster operation.  However, the tradeoff is that you lose the 
robust backup that this admittedly slower method provided.  If 
you are going to run with the Auto-ReIndex off it is recommended 
that you back up your catalog disks.
 
-- Since Auto-Reindexing may now be disabled, we have added the 
'M' option which gives a manual Recreation of the Catalog files 
from the index files, which used to happen under Updating in the 
multiple mode (and which can still be achieved under Auto-
Reindex). The 'F' Option is now renamed 'R'.
 
-- FATCAT now takes better advantage of memory space resulting in 
a faster throughput, since disk accesses are reduced.  This will 
be apparent especially on floppy based systems.
 
-- The Printer Offset has been added as a configuration option 
for those who like to leave their paper in a fixed position on 
their printers. 
 
-- Command Line Control of Output is now provided.  See the 
section 'OUTCAT' for a description of this feature.  The output 
module will work from the menu, however, just as it did before.
On-line help available for OUTCAT with command OUTCAT //. 
 
-- Configuration setup provision allowing FATCAT to stop 
conflicting with the Plu*Perfect DateStamper's assumption that 
its special file would be first in any sort.

If you are using CP/M 3.0, you can use the "chain to program" BDOS 
service call.  It is bdos function 47.

You load a null-terminated command line into the default dma buffer, then:

You have reg C: 2fh
	 reg E: ffh if you want the ccpt to initialize the default drive
	        to the "current" drive and user number (rather than
		"reset" to default values).

Then call the BDOS (addr 5 was it?).

Don't know off hand if this call works in 2.2 or not.  Haven't worked
with that version for a few years now.

A friend of mine told me that PC magazine always does a November
issue on printers and this year included laser printers.  He said
that there are 2 November issues, so be sure you get the right
one.

An easier way to do this is to write a $$$.SUB file onto the A drive of
the system, then warm boot.  

A $$$.SUB file is usually the result of running SUBMIT.  The format is
to have all the commands (with arguments expanded) in REVERSE order with
each command occupying a 128 byte record.  Thus record 0 of the file
will contain the last command to be executed and record N-1 will contain
the first command, where there are N commands.

The format of each record is a count byte at offset 0, then the command
line to be executed at offset 1, then a 0 byte immediately after the
command (no CR or LF).

You can examine an existing $$$.SUB by running a long submit, pressing
the reset button halfway through, then booting from ANOTHER boot disk
and loading the original boot disk in B:.  Then use DDT on the existing
$$$.SUB file.  Be sure to delete this file before putting the boot disk
back in A: or you will keep going where you left off the next time you
warm boot.

DBASE II uses this method of program chaining, to execute something,
then return to DBASE.  You can too.  You don't have to worry about
overwriting the CCP or anything.  

Another trick is to reload your program at the end of the chain
procedure with some argument that tells it that it is being rerun.
Thus, you might get dates and other parameters from a file rather than
the user...  Avoid copyright messages, etc.

Let me know if you want to discuss this sort of thing further.

Hi. I am doing a survey on dbms's and dbms applications. I'm interested
in PC applications as well as larger scale applications (Unix, etc.). 

They type of information I'm looking for is: 

1) What type of dbms do you use (dBASE-III, Informix, Ingres, Rbase, etc.).
2) What type of system does it run on (Unix 4.2, PC-DOC, etc.).
3) What type of applications are you using your dbms for (accounting,
   mailing lists, bibliographical, etc.).

I'm most interested in #3, especially "unique" applications. This survey
is for personal use. Please send responses via mail. Also, if anyone
else is interested in this information, send me mail and I'll be glad to
forward my responses. Also, please respond even if you think your
applications are uninteresting, and if you have any ideas for dbms
applications that you have not seen done before. Thanks a lot....

CORRECTION: Sorry about any mixup, but it is the September 17,
1985 issue.  He brought it in today (21 jan).  In a nutshell, the
editor's choices are:

 - for daisy wheel printers, the Qume Sprint 11/90 PLUS for $2500.
   Comments were: one of the best in print quality, one of the noisiest,
   Qume printers have a workhorse reputation.  Tested at 62.8 cps.
 - for laser printers, the Apple LaserWriter for $6995.  It will
   connect to a PC serial port.  Accepts most Diablo control sequences.
   Stunning typeset-quality variable-size proportional fonts.  8 pages
   printed per minute (approx. equal to 108 cps).  Quiet.
   14 built in fonts.  Currently has 1 big
   disadvantage; if you are not using the printer in Diablo-compatible
   mode (ie. you want other than the Diable font), it must be programmed
   in the PostScript printer programming language.  At the time of the
   review, only Microsoft Word version 2.0 supported PostScript.

They had examples of the print quality of the print quality of all of the
printers reviewed.  The print quality of the LaserWriter was better than
that of the Qume.

I have a couple of Pertec FD250s that were originally 35 track.
The cam is long enough, but there's a limit stop on the head slide.

It's quite an easy matter to fix this (with a hacksaw!). I fixed one
of my drives for 40 track for disk interchange purposes.

***
I am looking for one or more computers for educational and/or office administrative
purposes for an organization which works with teenagers including those with
serious criminal records, and has an excellant record for providing them with
a means for getting on a constructive path in life.  There are several offices,
in New York, Boston, San Francisco, Los Angelos, and my own group in New
Jersey, any of which could use a system for administrative purposes.
Something IBM compatible (even Sanyo 555) would be ideal, or next best would
be any thing that will run WordStar.  Also a serial printer is needed.
Also, in New York at least, various volunteers are very interested in
setting up computers where they can be used to instruct the teens who
are in the follow through program.

If you live far away, I'm sure a means can be found to pay shipping.
Thank you for your time

If a discussion ensues, I'd like to be included.

Has anyone mentioned that placing a (single) new command, in the format
you describe for the submit file, at CCP+3, and then just RETurning from
your program will also do a chain?  I believe that the current disk and
user stay logged in with this procedure.  This is for CP/M 1.x and 2.x,
and of course, only works if the CCP hasn't been overwritten.  I don't
know about other versions of CP/M and I haven't ever used this myself,
so some of the details may not be exactly correct.

In-Reply-To: Your message of Sun, 19 Jan 86 18:22 EST.

DateStamper is a CP/M 2.2 system extension for time-and-date-stamping of
files.  It occupies under 1K of high memory, either above/in the bios
or below the CCP and stamps the created, accessed and modified date-and-time
of each file.  Each directory entry has a corresponding 16-byte
entry in the special datestamper file, which is the first directory entry
and occupies the first unreserved groups on a disk.  A disk is prepared,
once, for datestamping with the PUTDS utility, which creates the file,
moving existing entries/groups if necessary.

Except for the use of the one directory entry and space for the file
(1K per 64 directory entries) DateStamper and non-datestamper disks
are totally compatible.  All disk i/o is done at the bios level,
with little overhead.

DateStamper runs with most any type of real-time clock. Or with none,
in which case it keeps the date plus  "relative time" - one tick per
file access.  The clock interface is portable - applications programs
can read the current time with an extended bdos-getversion call.

The major utilities supplied with DateStamper are SDD - an extension
of Super Directory to include created/accessed/modified dates/times,
and DATSWEEP - a many-featured file-maintenance program that supports
incremental file backup, etc. by date and time.  Applications programs
can obtain a file's datestamps through a specified interface.

DateStamper runs with the standard Digital Research CP/m 2.2 bdos,
with various Apple 2/2e z80 look-alikes, Magnolia-H/Z 89/90, ZRDOS,
and some other variants.  Not, however, with 3.0 or TurboDos.

  In defense of Jay Sage, I would note that:
     1) The original definition of the program error byte (0 if error,
        non-zero if OK) made no sense intuitively and was confusing
        as well as inflexible.
     2) His upgraded CPR has never been publicly distributed.  Jay gave
        me a copy, with instructions to not give it out to anyone else.
        The CPR allows you to have both an extended command processor
        and an error handler, instead of forcing you to choose between
        them.  He also fixed some bugs in the original CPR.

Nope, no such call in 2.2
The call exists in 3.0 as well as MP/M and CP/M-86 however.

*** REPLACE THIS LINE WITH YOUR MESSAGE ***

I will be very grateful if anybody can supply me with technical information
about the Amstrad PCW8256. In particular:

1.	Can the 8 empty DRAM sockets be used to enlarge the RAM disc and if so
	how is it done. It does not seem to be enough to just fill the empty
	sockets.

2.	Can the serial port be accessed directly via the Z80 i/o ports and
	if it can, how?

3.	Is anything known about the internal format of Locoscript files?

                    New Firmware Upgrade
                    For USR Courier 2400

                    Kurt Reisler - SYSOP
              The Bear's Den (FIDONET 109/74)
               Wash-A-RUG (FIDONET 109/483)

Once  again,  US  Robotics has an upgrade to the  PROM-based 
firmware  of our USR Courier 2400 modems.   The latest  PROM 
release has a product code of 243.  To determine the product 
code  of  the  PROM in your  modem,  startup  your  favorite 
communications program,  and type the command "ATI0" and hit 
the  return key.   If your modem returns 243 as the 3  digit 
product  code,  then  you  have the latest  release  of  the 
firmware.  If anything lower is returned, you should call US 
Robotics immediately and request a firmware  upgrade.   They 
are  doing this on an exchange basis,  as they did with  the 
upgrade from 241 to 242.

To get your PROM upgraded,  call US Robotics at 800-DIALUSR, 
and ask for Technical Support.   Tell them that you need the 
PROM  upgrade  and  they  will  take care  of  it  for  you.  
Replacing the PROM is a simple proceedure.   Pop the old one 
out,  and  gently insert the new one.   That should  be  all 
there is to it.

From  what  I  understand,  the new  firmware  corrects  the 
"streaming"  problem  that some of us were  having  when  we 
called  other USR Courier 2400 baud modems.   The  streaming 
problem was characterized by the modems connecting,  and one 
or the other generating a continual stream of garbage.   The 
only way to break the connection was either to drop DTR,  or 
to  physically  turn  off the modem.   Not a  major  problem 
during a manual call,  but mine would up attached to a long-
distance  FIDO for 2.5 hours during FIDONET time  (OUCH,  my 
aching  phone  bill!).    The  new  proms  also  correct   a 
connection problem with Ventel 2400 baud modems.

  The BDS C compiler for 8-bit CPM systems has both chaining of programs
and root-segment capabilities.  Its a good deal even without these features,
but here is an added bonus for you.

only that it is an SONY MBC-225, and that it is one unit which has two
floppy drives. It also has a crt, and some memory. There also some
japanese writing on the front face of most keys, while still having english
characters on top of those keys. I would like to knmow if there is any software
for this unit, and if there is any over the net?

Please send reply to ldurham@usc-eclb.

Can anyone recommend a reasonably priced hard disk subsystem for the
S-100 bus (controller, drive, power supply, cables, cabinet).  I've
seen some ads (like from CCT) but they seem to be 2-3 times more
expensive than subsystems for IBM PCs.  Is this just because of volume
or are there some less expensive systems out there?

   I am trying to bring up a S-100 system using the California  Computer 
Systems 2718 2 serial + two parallel I/O card as a console.  I have both 
an  A  and  B revision,  and have noticed what appears to  be  a  timing 
problem with the aforesaid board. When I read the status for SIO port A, 
it resets the status flag,  causing a real problem when it's supposed to 
be waiting on it's keyboard scan loop. The practical effect is that when 
you  are  doing  something  like using DUMP to dump  a  file,  it  won't 
recognise  a ^S,  and thus scrolls until the end.  Is there anybody  out 
there with suggestions/recommendations to fix this problem? I have tried 
to get through to "technical support" at CCS in Sunnyvale for quite some 
time, with no success. 

   I  am also looking for a copy of a message published out here a while 
ago,  which  dealt with a patch to the CCS 2422 floppy  disk  controller 
making  it  more  reliable  in 8" <=> 5" operation.  I  am  planning  on 
implementing  a  mixed system,  and a resend of this  message  would  be

Hi.  I have an ad for a mail-order "surplus" place which is selling the
above mentioned CDC drives for $49.00 while Teac 55F drives are selling
for $99.00 (though the CDC drives are full height and the Teac drives are
1/2 height).  Has anyone any experience with CDC drives?  In fact, is CDC
still in the 5 1/2" drive business?  How about the Canon 2/3 height 96 tpi
drives that B.G. Micro is selling for $99?  THANKS in ADVANCE  -- Dave

We are running on an Altair S-100 CP/M-80 2.2 system and need help in
getting a working MEX overlay and MBYE and XMODEM overlays for the beast.
I know that they are out there somewhere, but the problem is where
will I find them, and how will I get them to the machine. We are
hoping to put up a BBS on the Altair using a Hayes 1200 external

me net-mail or call my RCPM and leave a message to SysOp. Thanks.

A new data compression algorithm has been developed and tested, and
we are attempting to determine the degree of interest in the new
technique before placing it int the public domain.

The algorithm is unique - has a compression efficiency comparable to
the Hoffman algorithm - but has the added feature of allowing the
user to read, and edit the data in its compressed form. This avoids
the time and error potential of the decompress-edit-recompress
cycle.

We would appreciate any guidance towards other techniques that permit
the manipulation of data in its compressed form, and general views
on whether a new algorithm is of interest.

Please reply directly if your response will not be of interest to
the entire INFO-CPM list.

I have an Altos 5-15D that uses CDC 5 1/4" 96tpi Quad Density drives.  I have
had
the system for 4 years and have had to replace one drive.  With some quad drives,
you can get by using Double Side, Double Density diskettes.  Not so with the CDC
drives.  You have to buy the soft sector double side, quad density diskettes.
These are typically twice as expensive.  The drives are very fast and I shuffle
a lot of bytes, so I have been happy with them.  Can't beat the $49 price.  Plese
send me the address of your mail order "surplus" place.  I might pick up a
few spares at that price.

Subject: ZCPR for RS Model 4

I'm seeking advice on installing ZCPR3 (and possibly ZRDOS) on my TRS-80
Model 4.  To date I cannot find the correct components to install these
enhancements.
 
SYSTEM CONFIGURATION
--------------------
 
I'm currently operating a TRS-80 Model 4 with 128k memory expansion 
installed, two external 5 1/4 in. SS/DD floppy drives and a Radio
Shack 5-Meg hard disk drive.  
 
Software:            Serial:              Comment:
CP/M 2.2             #CP2-1040-003828     Used MOVCPM.COM to create a
                                          63k system, allowing 1k to
                                          install hard disk driver.
 
HDRS5M.COM           #HDD-OU81-002626     Hard disk driver, also from
                                          Montezuma Micro.
 
Have some additional fee-software, ie. Montys Window and SYS2M that
reside in the ramdisk and will require additional "bit-fiddling" later
on if I'm going to continue to use them.  They make unadvertised use of
some addresses in the BIOS not previously claimed by DRI.
 
Biggest problem with the installation of ZCPR3 is that I do not have an
assembly language copy of the BIOS in order to create file CBIOSZ.ASM
required for the installation.  
 
Any information on getting ZCPR3 up and running on the above system will
be greatly appreciated.

If you cannot modify your BIOS, Z3-DOT-COM is about your only option.
This is a commercial product from Echelon, and it takes only a few
minutes to install.  It creates a COM file that contains a Z-System.
On cold boot, run the COM file and it installs a Z-System in memory.

This option lacks the full functionality of the Z-System, and users
(in my experience) often want to later create a manually-installed Z-System
to pick up on the lack of functionality.  However, it is an easy out,
does not require a BIOS modification, and is a minimum of hastle (very small
learning curve and very little installation overhead).

There is a possibility that an RS Model 4 installation of ZCPR3 is
available, but I don't really know.  Echelon is the source to contact for
installation-specific questions.

According to the tech manual (and we've tried it, it works), you can
switch from 300/1200 by 600/2400 by removing the jumper position J1 on
level E and later boards.  Solder and cut time on earlier boards, it
says, but we have no experience with them.
  The manual also gives instructions (which we have NOT tried) about
providing other combinations and cranking up the maximum to 9600.  They
appear to involve some moderately serious wiring work.  Do you need
them?
  Note that from our experience, the O1 is operating fairly close to the
hairy edge of its capabilities at 2400, and you should expect a bit of
general flakyness as a result.
  You can, incidentally, set up most any baud rate you want under
software control to the 6850.

One option is to build one. Using either a PIO or the NCR SCSI interface
chip you can build a "host adapter" on a single S-100 board with a 
handful of other parts. SCSI <-> ST506 boards are about $140 and a 10
meg drive about $200. Assuming you use the power supply in your S-100
chassis that is all you need except for some really simple BIOS routines.
There is also a host adapter board available through Hamilton Avnet for
about $100 with 'self installing' BIOS routines.

Subject: Chaining programs by using a $$$.SUB file
Message-ID: <225@micropro.UUCP>
Date: 28 Jan 86 23:35:06 GMT
To:       info-cpm@AMSAA.ARPA

I have received a bunch of mail on my suggestion for program chaining
in CP/M with a $$$.SUB file.  Most people asked for more info at a beginners
level.

I wanted to acknowlege these requests and forestall more requests by
announcing that I have indeed placed this request on my things to do
list.  I promise a posting on the subject by Monday 3 February by the
latest.

I just saw on net.micro.mac that Borland's Modula-2 (for CP/M) was announced.
I didn't see any reference to shipping date, has anyone else got any more
information?

  I posted the first request for info on this subject, and last night
I got a very crude version of this methode up and running.  Thanks to
Ed Greenberg for his help.  I hope this helps answer some questions.
Sorry for the length...I wrote it in 8080 assembler, but the commenting
is copious.
  Ah yes...feel free to use this code in any shape, manner or form.  I'm
not responsible for any consequences, but it works fine for me.

Compupro users can be found on the CPRO National Users Group BBS (703) 670-5881
They grant guest privileges for long enough to decide if you are interested
and for your dues to arrive if you are.  Cost is $24 and includes a bimonthly
newsletter.  The people on this system are pretty knowledgeable about
Compupro/Viasyn/Compupro hardware and software.  There are a couple of other
systems which I have heard mention that are aimed at Compupro users but I
don't remember the details.  Address is:
C-PRO National Users Group
P.O. Box 2146
Woodbridge, VA 22193
(703) 494-2166 (voice)
This group is sponsored by Onetco who occasional offer members good
prices on Compupro hardware and software.

Hello Netlanders. I am very pleased with the responses I've been getting
from the database applications query I posted a couple weeks ago. I have
not yet compiled my results since they are still coming in daily. I will
post the results to the net when I do finish compiling them. I am just
posting now to let all who have responded know that I have not
forgotten about it. I am getting a lot of positive results, more than I
have expected, and best of all, NO Flames!!! Thanks all.... Expect a
posting of results in 2-3 weeks (as time permits)....

    I am looking for information on the ZCPR command processor and the
Z-system operating system. How hard is it to replace an existing CP/M 2.2 
OS with these replacements? If anyone could steer me in the right direction
on this I would really appreciate it (sources for info, etc.).
    I am using a DEC VT180 (Robin) CP/M machine. I imagine some of it 
would have to be machine dependant. Thanks in advance.
    Please send replies if possible to my BITNET address. If not, UUCP is fine.

As the sign says, I need the address for the CP/M

Any help would be appreciated.

Running WSINSTAL asks me for my terminal type, then exits.
WSU.COM is unchanged, WS.COM is not created.  What gives?
Am I missing something?  I have:

				WSU.COM

I would like to get the sources to small C Ver 2.x. I know some
folks have added floating etc. and would like to get the "mostest"
version. Is it in some "clean" format on Simtel-20?
