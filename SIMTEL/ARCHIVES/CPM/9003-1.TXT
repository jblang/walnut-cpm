hi there,

   i wanted to say thank you to everyone that replyed to me and gave me
   suggestions.  some of them worked and some didn't.  it turns out that
   i wasn't given some very crucial information with the problem.  it's
   exchanging everything nicely now (well fairly nicely).

Message-ID: <49600001@uxa.cso.uiuc.edu>

In the -README file of QTERM.LBR, it states that files matching
"*.?Y?" are compressed using the LZH technique.  Something that 
appears to handle this (and other formats) is LT29.COM (which is
from Simtel20's PD2:<CPM.ARC-LBR>LT29.LBR).  It also has the nice
feature that it will extract files from libraries and decompress them
on the fly from whatever format their in.  I haven't used LT29 a lot,
but it seems to work well on the few things that I have tried.

The Kaypros (aside from the Robbie and other such creatures) use regular IBM
style drives.  You may have problems getting a single sided drive, in this case
just use a standard IBM 360K double sided drive, and the "extra" side will just
be ignored.  This also makes upgrading to double sided drives easier...

Subject: Quatris?!

Waaaaaahhhhhhhh!

If some of you remember, or if you don't, I posted a note long time ago
asking people if they knew of a place where I can get a decent game to
play of my QX-10.  Two people responded, and one of them gave me the
ones that he wrote.

I didn't hear of Quatris's existence until AFTER I wrote the first
version of Tetris.  Had I known earler, I would not have had to write
the whole spiel myself, while developing a perpetual jealosy for those
jolly ones enjoying life in the MacWorld downstairs.  (Last semester,
everyone in my apartment had a mac, except me, and they ALL had Tetris!)

Oh, well.  Now that it is done, and although I haven't seen Quatris, I
think my Tetris is better than Quatris  (?)   :-)  Pleas try it out.

Besides, the Division III process here, which I called a "thesis," is
more like a dissertation than a normal college Thesis.  Most people take
a whole year to do just that and nothing else.  I am doing it in one
semester, and programming, I find, and gaming are the one of the good
ways of stress relief I know of.  Hey, think of the fringe benefits
for you (coming up: a pacman!  And, don't tell me you just saw one in
Simtel yesterday... :-)   )  !!!

Recent posting asks if Turbo Pascal is still available 
for CP/M, the answer is YES.  A few months ago I finally took 
the plunge.  The source is 

   Elliam Associates
   PO Box 6922
   Los Osos, CA  93412

      Phone:  (805) 466-8440

They have a huge amount of stuff for CP/M, ask for their catalog.  

The price for Turbo Pascal was $60.00 and it was version 3.1.

I have recently upgraded my modem to 2400 baud.

The old program I was using (Crosstalk) can't seem to keep up.

So I suppose its time for me to upgrade to something written this
decade.

Any suggestions?   (About all I have right now is the software
that came with the QX-10, and Crosstalk.  I acquired this machine
mostly for use as a terminal.)

Subject: ZCPR, Turbo Pascal, BYE

Gary P. Gray asked:

    A) Is ZCPR a public domain (or shareware) program?
    B) Is ZCPR worth bothering with on a non-hardisk system...
    C) Is Turbo Pascal still available for CPM?
    D) What is the bye program?

   As the author of the most recent versions of ZCPR, I think I can answer
(A): yes and no.  Versions of ZCPR up to and including version 3.3, though
copyrighted, may be used freely for noncommercial purposes.  Version 3.4 is
available commercially only.  However, all of these ZCPR versions work only
on CP/M-2.2 computers and require modifications to the BIOS to install them.
The modern way to install ZCPR (now called Z-System) is with the commercial
programs NZCOM (for CP/M-2.2 systems) and Z3PLUS (for CP/M-Plus systems).
They install (and remove) automatically under the host CP/M system, and they
offer a great deal more flexibility.

   In my opinion, the answer to (B) is yes.  At the time I developed ZCPR31
(and perhaps even the first cuts at ZCPR33), I did not own a computer with a
hard disk.  Z-System is much nicer with a hard disk (and a RAM disk), but
what software isn't!  There are plenty of people using Z-System on floppy-
only computers, and there are tricks that can significantly improve
performance under those circumstances.

   The answer to (C) is also yes.  It even comes with a nice, new, loose-
leaf manual (yea! we can leave it open to a page while working).

   BYE is a resident system extension program that allows the computer to
operate as a remote-access system.  Basically, BYE handles answering calls
and redirecting console I/O through the modem port.  I wrote about BYE in
one of my columns in The Computer Journal, and the file (TCJ##.WZ or
TCJ##.MZG) should be available from SIMTEL20 or Royal Oak (and surely must
be on my Z-Node BBS).  Unfortunately, I do not remember the volume number
(## in above file name templates).

I am looking for any information I can find on the

machine ran CP/M, but I know very little else about
it, and I got the machine with no software.
I don't as a rule follow CP/M developments, so please forgive
me if I have posted this to the wrong newsgroup.

I picked one up mostly as a curiosity, and all I know
about it is what I can see with my own eyes.
It has two  3.5" floppy drives, plus a bunch of
expansion connectors, and a monitor in rom.

If anybody can give me leads to information about this
machine, I would greatly appreciate it.

hello all ....

    i guess its time i stop being a 'lurker' after seeing all
the good info thats come across the net....  and ask the experts
what i am doing wrong! i am trying to get to H89's (z80 cpu) to 
talk to each other. i first tried going rs-232 cables to a modem
on each machine then a direct phone connect cable instead of going
into the wall i went to the other modem with xmodem running on 
each machine. but i could not get the modems to "See" each other.
next step i tried to use a null modem cable going from one modem
port to the other. no luck there either. i guess this weekend ill
try a regular rs-232 cable from modem port to modem port and see 
if that will work. all the time i am using xmodem for software.
any and all assistance will be appreciated.

I have an '83 Kaypro 4 (no graphics or internal modem).  It came (new) 
with 2 full height DSDD (TANDON100-2's?) drives.  When drive B died 
(became un-alignable) it was replaced with a 1/2 height PC type drive.
The same drive on the Kaypro will format a disk to 390K and on a PC it
will get 354K (360K if K=1000).  I have used a cpm based kit on the
KAYPRO (kit has a DYSAN alignment disk) to align a drive which was then
used in a PC with no problem (yet).  Just set the drive select jumper
correctly or your machine and make sure that the last drive on the
cable is the only one with termination resistors installed.

I've been looking for a (cheap) daisywheel printer for a while now, too.  No
luck, unfortunatly.  I guess if it's IBM compatable, it's still worth money.
However, the HP DeskJet has to hit $300 sooner or later, and then...

BTW, I'm starting to have serious regrets about my original posting.   It
appears that the "ridiculous" price I paid for my machine was quite high,
actually.  I'm just burning with jelousy...

Well how about this.  I got two working Diablo 1650's, the service manuals,
alignment tools, spare parts for free.

Uh, but they are not for sale.

IMHO nobody anywhere makes a better daisy wheel printer than Diablo.  Ribbons
are fairly reasonable and readily available.  What more can you ask for.

    1. Ability to save and restore the date-stamping info that ZSDOS 
       uses.
    2. Ability to backup files based on date-stamps.
    3. Ability to backup files that are larger than a floppy disk.

Something that worked kind of cpio-like should be possible.  It could
write an archive that spans many disks; each disk would contain a
single file, with a name something like:

    03-06-90.nnn

where the nnn is the disk number so that the restore program could
tell if you had put in the right disk or not.  Each file stored inside
of the archive would start with a 128 byte header that would contain
all known info about the file, e.g.:
	
    1. File name, with appropriate bits for public, R/O, etc. set.
    2. File size.
    3. Drive and user area.
    4. File creation, modification, and access times.
    5. An optional CRC to check file integrity during a restore.

Since it would be using the DOS to write the files, it should be
portable between computers, assuming that they can read the same disk
format.

It seems that I have rambled on a bit.  Well, before I try to write
something like this myself, is there some program out there that I
have missed?

Yes, Micro-C is still in business. However, these days most of their
articals cater to the PC crowd. They did have a CP/M column on a
semi-regular basis, but I haven't seen one in a while. I heard a rumor
that Micro-C was to be sold to another publishing group. However, I have
seen no editorial evidence from Dave Thomson to support it. Micro-C is
still a good source for CP/M related ads, as most of the CP/M oriented
advertisers are still there. Consequently, it may be worth subscribing
for that alone.

Has anyone on the list worked with the Z80 SIO in its BISYNC mode? I am
going to be using it as my part in a token ring network for a computer
communications networks class I am taking this semester.  I have so far
gotten two Z80 computers to communicate over a BISYNC link, but only after
running both systems off the same clock (this in effect, gives the same
clock to both transmit and receive). The Z80 SIO manual does not mention
this, and I was rather suprised to find it so clock sensitive.  Our
textbooks mention little about BISYNC. I would appreciate anyone to share
their experiencees in working the SIO in BISYNC mode.
 
Thanx in advance,

My understanding of the Decision 1, was that it was NOT a single board
computer, rather an MPU-Z card (with ROM), a floppy disk controller (either
a Disk-Jockey 8", or a DJ/DMA 5/8"), and possibly a hard disk controller
(an HDC-A or an HDC/DMA).  They also had an IO card (either a Wunderbuss
or a Multi-IO card).

The CBIOS that came with my DJ/DMA controller was E3.  It would only
use soft-sectored 8" and hard sectored 5" (NorthStar Formats).

I asked for (and received) an upgrade to E4 (with a new prom and a new
PLA device for the DJ/DMA) that allowed me to use MD2 and MD3 disks
as well (soft sectored).  I have modified my CBIOS to recognize some
other soft-sectored formats as well:  Heath-Zenith, OSBORNE-1, and IBM-PC
CPM-86.  (There is a problem with the OSBORNE code as the DJ/DMA seems
to be able to read, but not write in the SD mode, even though DJFORMAT
claims to be able to format them....)

I also received an IBIOS with the HDC/DMA I purchased which seemed to
be a spin-off of E3, but would allow for dynamically installing new
devices into the BIOS (I'm not sure how, this software came on an 8"
disk, and I only have 5" drives).

I wrote a RAMDISK driver for the Compupro CPU-Z board using its
bank switching technique.  It was quite easy to integrate it into
the Morrow BIOS (thanks to their high level/low level device
implementations, I was able to bury all of the low level code in ROM on the
CPU card!).

I had no trouble upgrading the MW portion of the CBIOS to support the
Shugart 5MB drives, and then a MINI-SCRIBE 40MB drive I was using.
The only complaint I had was that the CBIOS as shipped would only support
ONE set of drive parameters (to minimize re-initializing the HDC/DMA).
That meant you couldn't mix different sized hard disk drives, you could
use up to 4 of the same sized drive though.

One final note, the Morrow CBIOS assumes you have access to MAC or RMAC
to assemble it!  I spent a lot of time removing the macros so I could
assemble it with ASM.  Then I "inherited" a copy of RMAC with an OSBORNE
from a relative.  Sigh!  It was also relatively easy installing ZCPR-3.0
support into the BIOS, tho you start to run out of room in the BOOT sector
of the 5" disks!  You have more leaway if you boot from 8" (and lots of
extra room if you boot directly from your Hard disk if you can!)

You successfully jammed a hard drive in a Kaypro 2?  How long did it 
take you?  Did you just go trial and error until it flew, or did you 
get a hold of some material on the subject?  

I ask because I've been messing with it for a while now, with minimum 
results ... the pair of 2's I own came with nothing more than the 
really lame "Meet Your Kaypro" docs that they gave to business jerks 
so they'd know which way was up for the floppy ... no schematics or 
tech material in sight ... I'd just buy a 10, but people want the moon 
for them around here ... $600.00 minimum ...

Any info that you could point me to would be vastly appreciated ...

I have inherited an Osborne 1- however...

I do not have anything to put on the "ext video" card edge, which very
much makes it worthless.

What I would like would be an adapter that actually sent out composite
video, I've already got a suitable 12" monitor.  But beggars cannot be
chosers, so if I can just fire up the internal 5 incher, so be it...

It's cute that Osborne does not provide a pinout, or at least they could
have designed the silly thing so the internal was active w/o a plug!  Not
very nice.

I realize one cannot send schematics by ascii mail- I'll pay for this info
by regular mail if someone has a schematic and is in a giving mood.  I
assume the internal monitor can be activated with some simple jumpers,
tho God only knows which pins to jumper!

I'm looking for a simple and straight forward editor (preferably video
oriented).  I am going to get VDO25B.LBR from Simtel20.  Does anyone
have any opinions, gripes, raves, etc. about it?  Also, can anyone
suggest a better video editor?

Subject: Z80A Assembler algorithm needed!
Message-ID: <1698@gould.doc.ic.ac.uk>

Apologies that this isn't directly CP/M based but its the closest I could get.

I'm writing a Z80 cross assembler/disassembler and emulator on a 68000-based
machine, and I've run into a spot of bother. The Z80 is such a strange beast
that I can't work out a decent assembler algorithm, and although I've done a
disassembler, I'm not whether its optimal or not.

Please can anyone suggest a reference for good Z80 assembler/disassembler
algorithms, or even better, source? Ideally it would cover the undocumented
instructions too. Because I'm going to include an emulator I'd like a pretty
efficient version of the disassembler (or instruction decoder).

Advice for a good Z80 reference would be appreciated, as I'm going to have to
learn the exact functionality of every Z80 instruction - I'm familiar with
most, but some (eg IM 0/1/2) I'm a little unsure of.

Please e-mail as I don't (can't) subscribe to this newsgroup.

Thanks in advance for any help,

I have a freind with an early Osborne 1. He is having trouble. It won't

He has cleaned the keybord as well as possible and suspects the keybord
or cable may have gone bad. Any advice? Anyone have a keybord or cable?

Hey!  I'm looking for one of those too.  If any one has any info on vi-like
editors for CP/M, I (and at least two other people reading this group) would
appreciate hearing about it.  What is this "S" editor?

I've been thinking about just sitting down and writing a vi clone when I have

I don't know what kind of computer you're planning to run it on
because I hear that VDO is really specialized for the computer you
want to run it on.  It uses memory-mapped video displays like that
on the Osborne, and I think, the Kaypro.  In other words, you can't
use it on a system designed to run with a dumb terminal like my
Dynabyte DB8/1 running off a CPU port, or my Ampro Little Board.
Which brings me to...

> Does anyone

I stongly suggest you look for a package called ZDE13.  It's
designed after VDE, but it works on Z-System (ZCPR3.x), but
optionally, you can use it (As the README file says) with vanilla
CP/M.  I've been using it a lot and it's a GREAT little editor.
It's not WordStar, but for small files small enough to fit in
memory (nothing over say, 30-35k), it's perfect.

The summary line says all.  But thanks to anyone who sends me help
anyway.  But then again, who knows?  Maybe I can build a better cable
thanks to any of you folks out there.

Anyway, does anyone know how to modify the source to the Ampro's
BIOS (I have version 1.4) to accomodate for an IOP (for which I
have source, so that's not a problem)?

     This one's easy.  Just build a cable with an IDC header on one end to
fit the connector on the LittleBoard.  On the other end, place a female
DB-25.  Install IDC connector on board, and connect IBM parallel cable to
other end.  Voila!  Centronics!

Message-ID: <1292@mindlink.UUCP>

I've got a pair of NorthStar Advantages which I would like to use to control a
number of digital hardware projects I am working on for college. To do this, I
need a bit of hardware information. Does anyone know where I could get
schematic diagrams, BIOS ROM listings and/or pinouts for the expansion bus?
Does anyone have this information collecting dust in the closet?

Another thing I might be interested in are upgrades to this beast. I know that
North Star offered a hard drive for it. Does anyone have an old hard drive
controller for an Advantage? It doesn't have to work, but, since I am a poor,
starving student (heavy emphasis on poor), it should be reasonably inexpensive.

Thanks muchly!

Hello all,
 
I just pulled the small C compiler from SIMTEL20 and have a few problems.
 
First, many of the entries in the library extract with CRC errors. These
are the source files for the C comiler (text files) and the garbage at the
end of each file is easily edited out.
 
Second, I can't seem to get the version for the ASM (LASM) assembler to
send its output to an output file, all the assembler code generated by
the comiler goes to the screen.
 
Thoughts?

     MAC follows the standard macro implementation... you could always use

     Alpha Systems sells Turbo Pascal v3.01a.  I don't have contact info.

May I suggest BD Software's C compiler package (version 1.60) or
Manx Axtec C ... either can produce stand-alone ROMable code.
BDS C would be the less expensive of the two.

Hi

The subject line says it all: I need some information (pin assignment, register
locations, interfacing) for the MSM 5832 and RTC 58321 clock chips (in view of
putting one of them onto my homebrew Z80 system).

I have one confusing piece of information: I read somewhere that the 58321 is
the pin-compatible successor to the 5832, just with the 32768Hz quartz
built-in. But the 5832 is a 18-pin chip, the 58321 is a 16-pin chip. What is
going on ?

Most important question: Which distributor carries the 5832 (Jameco sells
58321s).

OKI semiconductor makes them (617) 279-0293.

The 5832 has +/- 30 sec adjust, separate addr/data lines, has a funny
VCC/GND pin location, and lives in 18 pins. 

	1=VDD	18=hold
	2=WRITE	17=XT*
	3=READ	16=XT
	4=A0	15=+/-30SEC ADJ.
	5=A1	14=TEST
	6=A2	13=GND
	7=A3	12=D3
	8=CS	11=D2
	9=D0	10=D1

The 58321 looks like :

	1=CS2	16=VDD

 If you are building your own hardware, the 5832 has very slow access

Hello again, I'm the one who posted recently in need of a way to activate

... and would like to thank them. 

Taking their advice, I called Worswick Industries at...

... and found they still sell card-edge to composite video adapters for
$19.00.  Sorry, Les, no "official" shunt; but this dude activates the 
internal monitor as well, so will get you going regardless.

I received today an adapter which works, er, sort of.  The picture lacks
contrast and is not very stable, however.  So I've ripped it apart, to have
a look at its guts.

True to form, and as expected after reading my e-mail, the thing connects
all the top pins on one side to the bottom corresponding pins on the same 
side, to turn on the internal monitor.  It's interesting to note the card
edge fingers are mirrored, so one can put the connector on either way, and
it'll work.  What consideration on Osborne's part!  Too bad they didn't
just put feedthroughs on the *&#@$% motherboard to begin with!

The thing turned out to be eating five signals- +5V,GND,Hsync,Vsync,VIDEO.
The H and V sync pulses are generated by an 'LS221 dual one-shot, whose
periods are not adjustable.  Their outputs are connected by divider to the
video signal, and buffered by a transistor, feeding an internal 75 ohm load.

The instability is (apparently) being caused by incorrect sync timing, and
the lack of contrast because the monitor has a 75 ohm load too, which loads
the transistor too heavy and makes the overall signal too small (this isn't
helping the stability either, if the monitor can't *find* the syncs, they
may as well not be there)!  So I'm gonna try ripping out a resistor and
adding a pot, to replace the fixed resistor controlling timing. 

If I ultimately can't figure this out, I'll "cheat" and buy a solution!

It looks very doable (at first flush) to get an IBM mono monitor signal
from the card edge; then you could use the flotilla of these monitors
one can often find laying around.  Nobody wants to play with composite 
much anymore.  :-(

I also got info for a user's group I'll look into: 

              415-755-2000
              First Osborne Group

              Daly City, CA. 94015-0474

These folks are reputed to have mucho goodies, and concerning CP/M machines
of *all* flavors, too!

I have used Hochstrasser M-2 for a stand-alone system with great success.
Hochstrasser  sold the right for Hochstrasser M-2 to some-one else
(or did his company simply fold..). That some-one else also
markets a cross compiler that runs on PC (I think). Anyway, you
could just run the CP/M80 version on a simulator on a HUGE PC, that
should be plenty fast.. .

Apart from the lack of a symbolic debugger, I can find no fault with
Hochstrasser M-2. Due to the simplicity of the language (i.e no file-system
unless required, no fancy graphics or anything) you have a
very good idea of what goes into your ROM's. The code produced is
fairly compact, my 1100 line program compiled into appr. 4K of code.

The code is fairly stable (i.e. I have NEVER found an error), the 
compiler is compiled by itself.. .

You can buy the assembler source for the run time library, which means
that 
	-a you can use sophisticated commands of super-Z80
	   processors, or coprocessors.

	-b you can catch the error messages (only three : 
	   REAL math overflow, out of heap & out of stack).
	   Alternatively you can move the code up (using the linker
	   to do this), so that a call to address 0005 (BDOS entry)
	   leads to a re-start.. .

The linker of the Hochstrasser system can be made to put the 
code / data / heap / stack anywhere, so that a system with
non-contiguous and/or mixed RAM-ROM memory works. 

You can interface assmebler routines (using a normal DEFINTION
module, and a converter program to make a REL file appear
to be compiled by Hochstrasser) to the code with no problems.
This is not really necessary (unless you want speed, in which case
I'd recommend a 68000 based system..), except for port IN/OUT
routines that are no provided in the normal system (again included
in the runtime lib source).

The language supported conforms to Ed.2 of Wirths book,
except it doesn't provide co-routines or interupt handlers. 
Co-routines and INT handlers are, however, included in the runtime 
library source.

The price is reasonable, even for hobby use.

Mail me if you want specifics of the company currently selling
Hochstrasser M-2 (I only hope I didn't throw out their letter),
alternatively you could talk to Grey Matter, the british shop 
that sells compilers, they advertise in BYTE, call them on phone for
good service, write them for slow service..)


As for the general suitability of M-2 as a language for embedded systems,
I can only say that I prefer it to anything. You can fiddle with bits
as much as you like (which makes programming of peripherial chips
a breeze), and at the same time have a tight type-checking sytem etc.

Subject: ark/unark
Message-ID: <1450@anasaz.UUCP>

I have succeeded in getting the Simtel20 server at North Dakota to send
me some files.  The first one I got was the CP/M index, which was in an
archive along with some support files.

After I concatenated and "uudecode"ed the archive parts, I tried to
unarchive it using the archive program on our Unix machine.  This is the
System Enhancement Associates ARC 5.12 program ported to SystemV by Mike
Stump and Chris Seaman.  The Unix version identifies itself as version
1.1 dated 27 Mar 87.  This attempt failed, with various error messages
that generally indicated the archive was corrupted.

I then got the server to send me the CP/M program "unarc" (version 1.6,
dated 3/21/87) from the starter kit directory.  This program successfully
unpacked the archive.

My question is this: Why couldn't the unix version of unarc manipulate
the archive?  Aren't the formats supposed to be the same?  Has anyone
else tried this combination?  I want to be able to completely process
(uudecode/unark/whatever) files from Simtel20 on my Unix machine so I
can print the documentation on its high-speed laser printer and examine
the README files before I kermit them on to my CP/M boxes.  Shouldn't
this be possible?

Thanks for any insight.

What is "S"?  Is this related to "Stevie" (the Vi clone for Minix)?
I started ported Stevie to CP/M, but I realized it just would not fit.
Also, even if it were trimmed down, there would not be enough memory
left over to hold a document of any size.

Anyway, does anyone know of a screen-based editor for CP/M
(or any other OS, as long as it could be ported) that I can get
the source code for?  

Has anyone seen source code for the "VDE" or "VDO" editors?  These
are small, fast, in-memory editors with Wordstar-inspired command sets.

I am looking for this so my UZI unix-clone operating system can
have a display-based editor.  (Ask me about UZI-280, which runs
on the Z-280, and gives you 64K process sizes with protection,
and (soon to come) paging, split I and D space (64K+64K), and all
the other goodies you get on a PDP-11 running 7th Edition Unix!)

		UZI: UNIX Z-80 IMPLEMENTATION

		  Written by Douglas Braun


Introduction:

UZI is an implementation of the Unix kernel written for a Z-80 based
computer.  It implements almost all of the functionality of the
7th Edition Unix kernel.  UZI was written to run on one specific
collection of custom-built hardware, but since it can easily have device
drivers added to it, and it does not use any memory management hardware,
it should be possible to port it to numerous computers that currently use
the CP/M operating system.  The source code is written mostly in C,
and was compiled with The Code Works' Q/C compiler.  UZI's code was
written from scratch, and contains no AT&T code, so it is not subject
to any of AT&T's copyright or licensing restrictions.  Numerous 7th
Edition programs have been ported to UZI with little or no difficulty,
including the complete Bourne shell, ed, sed, dc, cpp, etc.


How it works:

Since there is no standard memory management hardware on 8080-family
computers, UZI uses "total swapping" to achieve multiprocessing.
This has two implications:  First, UZI requires a reasonably fast
hard disk.  Second, there is no point in running a different process
while a process is waiting for disk I/O.  This simplifies the design
of the block device drivers, since they do not have to be interrupt-based.

UZI itself occupies the upper 32K of memory, and the currently running
process occupies the lower 32K.   Since UZI currently barely fits in 32K,
a full 64K of RAM is necessary.

UZI does need some additional hardware support.  First, there must be
some sort of clock or timer that can provide a periodic interrupt.
Also, the current implementation uses an additional real-time clock
to get the time for file timestamps, etc.  The current TTY driver assumes
an interrupt-driven keyboard, which should exist on most systems.
The distribution contains code for hard and floppy disk drivers, but
since these were written for custom hardware, they are provided only
as templates to write new ones.


How UZI is different than real Unix:

UZI implements almost all of the 7th Edition functionality.
All file I/O, directories, mountable file systems, user and group IDs,
pipes, and applicable device I/O are supported.  Process control
(fork(), execve(), signal(), kill(), pause(), alarm(), and wait()) are fully
supported.  The number of processes is limited only by the swap space
available.  As mentioned above,  UZI implements Unix well enough to
run the Bourne shell in its full functionality.  The only changes made
to the shell's source code were to satisfy the limitations of the C compiler.

Here is a (possibly incomplete) list of missing features and limitations:

    The debugger- and profiler-related system calls do not exist.

    The old 6th edition seek() was implemented, instead of lseek().

    The supplied TTY driver is bare-bones.  It supports only one port,
    and most IOCTLs are not supported.

    Inode numbers are only 16-bit, so filesystems are 32 Meg or less.

    File dates are not in the standard format.  Instead they look like
    those used by MS-DOS.

    The 4.2BSD execve() was implemented.  Additional flavors of exec()
    are supported by the library.

    The format of the device driver switch table is unlike that of
    the 7th Edition.

    The necessary semaphores and locking mechanisms to implement 
    reentrant disk I/O are not there.  This would make it harder to
    implement interrupt-driven disk I/O without busy-waiting.


A Description of this Release:

Here is a list of the files supplied, and a brief description of each:


intro:		What you are reading

config.h:	Setup parameters, such as table sizes, and the device
		driver switch table.

unix.h:		All strcuture declarations, typedefs and defines.
		(Includes things like errno.h).

extern.h:	Declarations of all global variables and tables.

data.c:		Dummy to source extern.h and devine globals.

dispatch.c:	System call dispatch table.

scall1.c:	System calls, mostly file-related.

scall2.c:	Rest of system calls.

filesys.c:	Routines for managing file system.

process.c:	Routines for process management and context switching.
		Somewhat machine-dependent.

devio.c:	Generic I/O routines, including queue routines.

devtty.c:	Simple TTY driver, slightly-machine dependent.

devwd.c:	Hard disk driver.  Very machine-dependent.

devflop.c:	Floppy disk driver.  Very machine-dependent.

devmisc.c:	Simple device drivers, such as /dev/mem.

machdep.c:	Machine-dependent code, especially real-time-clock and
		interrupt handling code.

extras.c:	Procedures missing from the Q/C compiler's library.

filler.mac:	Dummy to make linker load UZI at correct address.

makeunix.sub:	CP/M SUBMIT file to compile everything.

loadunix.sub:	CP/M SUBMIT file to load everything.


Miscellaneous Notes:

UZI was compiled with the Code Works Q/C C compiler and the Microsoft
M80 assembler under the CP/M operating system, on the same hardware
it runs on.  Also used was a version of cpp ported to CP/M, since
the Q/C compiler does not handle macros with arguments.  However, there
are only a couple of these in the code, and they could easily be removed.

Because UZI occupies the upper 32K of memory, the standard L80 linker
could not be used to link it.  Instead, a homebrew L80 replacement linker
was used.  This generated a 64K-byte CP/M .COM file, which has the lower 
32K pruned by the CP/M PIP utility.  This is the reason for appearance
of the string "MOMBASSA" in filler.mac and loadunix.sub.

To boot UZI, a short CP/M program was run that reads in the UZI image,
copies it to the upper 32K of memory, and jumps to its start address.
Other CP/M programs were written to build, inspect, and check UZI filesystems
under CP/M.  These made it possible to have a root file system made before
starting up UZI.  If the demand exists, these programs can be included
in another release.


Running programs under UZI:

A number of 7th Edition, System V, and 4.2BSD programs were ported to
UZI.  Most notably, the Bourne shell and ed run fine under UZI.
In addition the 4.2BSD stdio library was also ported.  This, along
with the Code Works Q/C library and miscellaneous System V library 
functions, was used when porting programs.

Due to obvious legal reasons, the source or executables for most of these
programs cannot be released.  However, some kernel-dependent programs
such as ps and fsck were written from scratch and can be included in future
releases.  Also, a package was created that can be linked to CP/M .COM
files that will allow them to run under UZI.  This was used to get
the M80 assembler and L80 linker to run under UZI.  Cpp was also
ported to UZI.  However, it was not possible to fit the Q/C compiler
into 32K, so all programs (and UZI itself) were cross-compiled under CP/M.

The Minix operating system, written for PCs by Andrew Tanenbaum et al,
contains many programs that should compile and run under UZI.  Since
Minix is much less encumbered by licensing provisions than real Unix,
it would make sense to port Minix programs to UZI.  In fact, UZI itself
could be ported to the PC, and used as a replacement for the Minix kernel.


#########################################################################


UZI-280 is in the process of being written.  My computer system
now has a Z280 with 128K of memory.  The kernel and user processes 
now run in seperate address spaces, but total swapping is still used
at present.  The various hardware traps of the Z280 (privileged instruction,
system stack overflow, access violation) are handled correctly.
There is proper protection, in the sense that a user process cannot munch
kernel data, like in the original UZI.  Current plans include allowing
user processes to run seperated I and D address spaces (thus allowing
64K of code and 64K of data), and implementing demand paging instead of total
swapping.  UZI280 will then have the power and functionality (more or less) of 
a PDP-11/34 or PDP-11/60 running 7th Edition Unix.

By the way, I have modified The Code Works' Q/C Compiler to generate Z280
instructions and also handle a few more syntactic constructs (like
initalization of automatics).  Does anyone know if The Code Works still
sells this compiler (or is even in business)?  Any input on how I might
legally distribute this would be appreciated.

P.S.  You do NOT need my Z280 compiler to compile UZI280, just some assembler
macros to define special Z280 instructions.
Stay Tuned,

Message-ID: <5211@balu.UUCP>

Hello Ralph,

you have to distinguish between two 58321's :
- the MSM 58321 from OKI is a functional (not pin2pin) replacement of the 5832,
- the RTC 58321 from Seiko-Epson is a direct replacement for MSM 58321, with
  built-in quartz (let XT terminals open).

By the way, if you are designing a new circuit, think about the RTC 72421,
also from Seiko-Epson. It's a newer design, making the RTC registers available
via direct bus connection using 16 I/O (or Memory) addresses. The access time
is 120 ns, which should be small enough for every micro. Quartz included also.
Or have a look at the new chips of Dallas Semiconductor, i.e. DS 1286 or 1287.
These contain RTC with quartz, 50 bytes of NVRAM and the appropriate Lithium
Source for 10 years operation (guaranteed).
The RTC 72421 is housed in a 16-pin-DIP, the DS 1286 comes in a 28 pin and the
DS1287 in a 24 pin DIP case with some height (cause of the battery).

Look at the new chips instead of using the old ones, of which noone knows how
long they will be manufactured...

greetings from West Germany, Tilmann Reh

disclaimer: I have no connection to the companies mentioned above, instead of
using their chips with great effort.

To make the internal monitor of your Ozzy work you only need to jumper all
of the pins on the top side of the edge connector to each of the pins on the
bottom side.  I think this means hook 1 to 2, 3 to 4, 5 to 6. ...  I
have all of the Ozzy schematics but not here.  Only two of the pins are
needed to drive a normal monitor.  You could get plugins for RCA connectors
from many places.

I would try to contact someone at FOG (first Osborne Group) for vendors
that still sell such things.  I think FOG is listed in the computer shopper

Yes, but the 5832 is S-l-o-w with a capital S. (My Alspa system uses one for
its clock/calendar.) If you wanty to do something else, like service a keyboard
interrupt, during that time you're out of luck. Better bet is to hang the thing

Isn't this why wait states were invented? If you are designing your own
hardware, or in any properly designed hardware, the speed of the peripheral
chip is unrelated to the reliability of operation, only to the performance.
This is something that has largely been forgotten in the @#$%^ Clone world.
Used to be, on systems where different CPU clock speeds were likely to be
encountered, there would be a jumper on each add in board to set the wait
states for that board, to match it to the processor speed. If this practice
had not been dropped with the Big Blue Box there wouldn't be all the
problems of finding peripherals that work at the new, higher clock speeds.
But that's another story in another news group.

Hi.  About a week ago I asked about the 5832 and 58321 clock chips.
Thanks to Roger Hanscom, Greg Ebert, Paul Lenz, Bill Robison and Tilmann
Reh,  I now know everything about the two chips.  Funny coincidence: The
day after posting my question, I got the databook from Dallas
Semiconductor in the mail (when I ordered it I didn't even know they
make clock chips).  They have a neat chip (DS1287A), which contains a
real-time-clock, quartz, 50 bytes of non-volatilie RAM, lithium battery,
and the circuitry to keep everything happy.  It nicely kills two birds
with one chip, and I'll just try it out (as soon as it arrives in the
mail).

Again, thanks to all who responded to my question.

By the way ... if am not affiliated with Dallas.  I haven't even got
their chip yet, just ordered it.

To the person who couldn't unarc stuff from simtel20...

One reason why you couldn't unarc the file(s) under Unix might
be that the files in the .ARC were squashed (i.e. type 9
compression). I don't think Unix ARC can handle those files yet.

TRENTON COMPUTER FESTIVAL 1990

The 15th annual Trenton Computer Festival will be held on April 21-22,
1990 on the campus of Mercer County Community College, Trenton, NJ.

A ticket costs $7.00 ($3.00 for students and senior citizens) and
provides admission for both days.  A "Sunday-only" ticket costs $5.00.

The keynote speaker will be David House, executive vice president of
Intel Corp.  He will speak in the Kelsey Theater at 4:00 PM Saturday.

Tickets for the banquet are $15.00.  Once more, Sol Libes will be the
master of ceremonies.

Because MCCC is a commuter college, the Flea Market will be BIGGER THAN
EVER BEFORE!!

ALL parking will be at Mercer County Park, with entrances on Hughes
Drive and on Old Trenton Rd. (county route 535).  A free bus will take
you to within 50 feet of the ticket booth.

I beg to differ. CP/M .ARK's _ARE_ compatible (and the same format) as DOS
.ARC's. I use UNARC16 (on a CP/M machine) on both types very regularly, and
it groks type 9 compression just fine - it will also unwrap either form of
AR[CK] file without noting any difference.

For those not already in the know, the only reason an .ARK is not a .ARC
is so that you know it's CP/M material inside.

Subject: COBOL-80 ACPDAT.ASM Routine for XEROX 820-II
Message-ID: <9003271827.AA10438@wugate.wustl.edu>

  Does anyone have an ACPDAT.ASM routine that I can add to my COBOL-80
runtime library?  This routine returns the system monitor date or time
as requested by a COBOL ACCEPT statement. Now all I get is the compiler
release date or time.  Microsoft has provided a skelleton ACPDAT.ASM
routine with the compiler documentation, but I have not been able to get
it to work on my system.

  If you happen to have a functional COBOL-80 ACPDAT.ASM routine for a
XEROX 820-II, or similar CP/M machine, I would appreciate your help!

  Thanks,

Message-ID: <28238@cup.portal.com>

We have a used DECmate II wordprocessing station which we replaces
with a 386 system and wordpPerfect. I would like to use the DEC
if I can get more software. The board is CPM and seems to run
CPM80. NO hard disk; just floppies. Can I use a communication package
to access the serial port for any use. In  the alternative would it
be very difficult to adapt the case monitor and keyboard to use
with another mother board ; such as an IBM ( MS-DOS) board. Eronomically
it was a great station! ( that is ergonomically). Mainly interested in
what I can salvage

Has anyone heard of (or better yet, used) a product called "The Ultraboard?"
It is a replacement motherboard for the Kaypro (I'm not sure which one) that
has the Hitachi 16-bit Z80 replacement (running at 12 or 16 MHz, I think) and
more memory, among other things.  I'd be interested in getting ahold of one of
these, new or used, if that's possible.  Thanks.

Use the ADM3A termcap.  If you have a newer II you might not get
inverse; I don't know because by II is one of the nice old ones.

The UltraBoard was a replacement motherboard for the Kaypro's with a
12 MHz Z-280 and 1 Meg of ram.  It was expected to achieve 6 MHz PC AT
speeds.  It had color video for an external monitor.  It was to make
use of the hard disk controller from Advanced Engineering Concepts.

I believe that the name of the company responsible for the UltraBoard
was Hitech Research.  They were the ones who bought up a lot of Kaypro's
stock of Kaypro 10 parts and started assembling them as Kaypro 20's
with Seagate ST-225 drives.

Before that, they had a product called Handyman, which was a plug-in 
board that gave you SideKick-like features without using and of the
Kaypro's onbaord ram.  It had its own ram, and its software was in rom.

The UltraBoard was is beta-test about three or four years ago, but 
after bugs were found in the video section, HiTech ran out of money
trying to fix the problem.  The last I heard, they were working on a
SCSI interface for '84 Kaypros.

I did talk to someone there over two years ago.  He said that they
would continue development when they could.  I should dig out their
number and give them a call (if they still exist).

Subject: XLISP: Highest version to run under CP/M-80 ?
Message-ID: <9003291256.AA17656@decpa.pa.dec.com>

What is the highest version of XLISP to run under CP/M-80 ?
[Or DEC RT-11 ?]

CP/M-80 is not mentioned in the manuals from V1.4 on, and
I've never seen V1.3.  V1.5 and up are definetly too big to
run under CP/M-80.  The sources for V1.2 are on the
Royal Oak RCP/M, but there is no '.COM in the library so
I don't know if it would actually build. although the
documentation mentions CP/M-80.  CompuServe has XLPCPM.COM
in the AI Expert forum library which purports to be
XLISP V1.5, but it's really V1.0.  Prior to V1.2 the
functions still retain C names instead of LISP names, so
I would prefer V1.2.

From some j-random BBS I also got something circa 1985
that says it's "Tiny Lisp V1.0" that smells a lot like
V1.2, but there were no sources -- has anybody seen this ?

Ideally I would like to find XLISP V1.2 binaries for CP/M-80,
MS-DOS, and RT-11 (I'll build it for VAX/VMS myself).  It
looks to be one of the only truly portable language across
my platforms of interest.  Once I get the skinny on the
best XLISP that will fit under CP/M, then I'll set to
building it everywhere if I have to.
