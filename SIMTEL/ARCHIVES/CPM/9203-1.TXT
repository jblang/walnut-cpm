Subject: interrupts, arunz, problems

Hi folks,
just recently I had problems with the newest ARUNZ-version from
simtel. My floppy-controller is interrupt-driven and, as I realized
this week, has an interrupt pending after power-on. Normally the
interrupt is cleared after a floppy-operation, which had been done first
after switching my computer on. But now I have switched to a hard-disk
which doesn't use the floppy-controller any more, so the interrupt
remains active. This led to the following problem:
   At power-on all interrupts are disabled with DI
   The system boots and logs drive A, the hard-disk.
   I'm running ZCPR3.3, so arunz is invoked to fiddle around with
   aliases, and I use much of them.
   The system crashes immediately.
It took me a long time to think of arunz as the problem, but as I
debugged arunz I found to my surprise DI and EI instructions, which
led of course to problems, as no interrupt routines exist as default.

Now my question is: Do I have to check all my programs to find out
which of them play around with the interrupt system or is arunz
a rare exception (as I hope) that uses DI,EI instructions?
Until now I have thought that only the bios or some very specialized
user programs should use the interrupt system.

I hope someone has a opinion on this and may enlight me on this
subject.
                    Thank you very much
                            Martin Frerichs

PS: I remember that someone looked for a gif-viewer for cpm.
    If there is still interest I can mail my version in turbo-pascal.
    It needs routines to draw lines and points on the screen.
    Alternatively I have adopted an include that prints to a file
    which may be send to a NEC printer.

SIMTEL20 is now up after having been down for almost a month because
of air conditioner trouble.  The PD1: disk is in the process of being
restored from the back-up tapes.  Recently uploaded files will be
added after that process is completed.

SIMTEL20 files are also available from mirror sites OAK.Oakland.Edu
(141.210.10.117), wuarchive.wustl.edu (128.252.135.4), ftp.uu.net
(137.39.1.9), nic.funet.fi (128.214.6.100), src.doc.ic.ac.uk
(146.169.3.7) or archie.au (139.130.4.6), by e-mail through the
BITNET/EARN file servers, or by uucpfrom UUNET's 1-900-GOT-SRCS.
See UUNET file uunet!~/info/archive-help for details.

OAK.Oakland.Edu is the most up-to-date mirror because I maintain it,
in addition to my duties at SIMTEL20.  I run OAK's mirror program
whenever new files are added at SIMTEL20.

Speaking of .ARK files, does anyone have source code?  Preferably C.

Fellow CP/Mers:

Anybody know if a CP/M version of Vax/VMS editor EDT exists?  If no,
does anyone know of a line-oriented or (better) character-oriented
editor (as in ED or Z-TEL) that also will fill lines so that a maximum
number of words are on a line (a la EDT's FILL command)?

Thanks in advance.

Subject: MEX Overlay for Sanyo 1250
Message-ID: <9203100939.AA15427@LL.MIT.EDU>

   I have someone with a Sanyo 1250 who is trying to get MEX running.  This
machine is apparently different enough from the other Sanyos (models 10xx and
11xx) that the standard Sanyo installation does not work.  A messed up screen
indicates that the terminal emulation is quite different, and with the screen
garbled it is hard to check out the serial port operation.

   If no one has a MEX overlay for this machine, an IMP or MDM740 overlay
would be almost as good.  Lacking that, some straight technical information
about the UART and its port addresses and the codes used by the screen would
probably get us going.  Thanks.

Hi there!

Does anyone know if there are any ftp PDS's to read CP/M files in
5+1/4" by PC/AT?

Any kind of information would be appreciated.
If you think it's too trivial to post, please email me.
Thanks.

Yes, the PKARC or PKUNPAK works fine for renamed .ARK-files. For .LBR-files
I use the DELBR11.EXE form the directory <MSDOS.STARTER>.

My problem are the .?Z? files in the SIMTEL CP/M archives. I couldn't find
a un-crunch-routine running in MSDOS environment. In the file-docs about
CP/M archives is a UNCR232.ARC mentioned, which should do the un-crunch.
But I couldn't find it yet.

Any ideas ??????

Subject: Summary - Re: 8-inch disk format? (was: The Original True Blue IBM PC)
Message-ID: <yn4gb4-@lynx.unm.edu>

I'm posting a summary mostly to save those who are just now seeing this
thread from feeling like they should answer!  I've gotten most of the
info I wanted and more - 13 messages in 72 hours!  However, if anyone
else has a phone number or address of a commercial disk/data conversion
shop that they were happy with - please e-mail it to me.

The summary:

The  CPT SSSD 8 inch disks are 77 tracks, 16 sectors of 256 bytes.  
    77 * 16 * 256 = 315,392 = 308Kb

Most CPM SSSD 8 inch disks are 77 tracks, 26 sectors of 128 bytes.  
    77 * 26 * 128 = 256,256 = 250.25Kb

(Thanks to Ralph Becker-Szendy for being 'firstest with the mostest' -
sending a very informative reply covering all manner of 8 inch disk
arcana - hard/soft sector, SS/DS SD/DD, etc. - less than 4 hours after
I posted the request - and to John D. Baker for confirming the 16*256
format from his experiments with some CPT disks.

Four respondents suggested reading data from the printer port, but
unfortunately the degree of access I have to the CPT does not extend
that far - I can use the CPT to print to paper, but not to tickle its
backside or innards.  Likewise for running Kermit or PIP.

Two respondents suggested using any commercial service that uses the
Shaftstall conversion package - apparently a very good product, but
naturally not cheap.  Several people gave detailed descriptions of
various 8 inch disk formats and layouts.

So, I'd like to thank:

    Ralph Becker-Szendy 
    John D. Baker 
    Alan J. Richer

Also, for those of you who offered to track down leads to services, or
offered other help - thank you all!  It is just so darned nice to be
able to ask hundreds of strangers for advice, and get so much so fast.  
I may be in contact with a few of you by e-mail or off-line soon.

Everybody who responded is being mailed a copy of this summary, and
if the sendmail gods are willing, you'll even receive it. :-) 

Thanks again,

Message-ID: <9203101015.AA15849@LL.MIT.EDU>

   This is an updated list of the items still available from the Zi/Tel Group
of the Boston Computer Society.  In return for contributions to help fund
user group activities, we would like to find new homes for these items where
they would be put to good use.  You may communicate your offers in any of the
following ways:

    (1) by leaving a message on the Zi/Tel BBS in the Boston area
        at 617-965-7046 (or 617-965-7785 to limit access only to the
        USR Courier HST modem on line 2)
    (2) by leaving a message on Jay Sage's Z-Node at 617-965-7259 (logon
        password is DDT)
    (3) leaving GEnie mail for JAY.SAGE
    (4) sending email to Jay Sage on Internet at the following
        address: sage@ll.mit.edu
    (5) sending postal mail to Jay Sage at
                1435 Centre Street
                Newton, MA 02159-2469
    (6) telephoning Jay Sage at 617-965-3552 weekday evenings or Sunday or
        during weekday days at 617-981-4704

The last method will probably be the least reliable and may take several
tries.  The email methods (first four methods above) would be best.  When it
comes time to send money, send a check payable to "BCS ZI/TEL" to the Newton
Centre address listed above.

   Now for the inventory of items!

                     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   First, there are boxes and boxes of HARD-SECTORED diskettes.  So far there
have been no firm or accepted offers for these.

     18   boxes of 8" 32-sector hard-sector diskettes
     17   boxes of 5.25" 10-sector hard-sector diskettes
      7   boxes of 5.25" 16-sector hard-sector diskettes

                     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   Then there is some miscellaneous hardware:

     1    Televideo 802H (CP/M with hard disk)
     1    Soroc 135 terminal
     1    Kaypro that needs work (probably fixable, certainly good
            for parts)
     1    mint condition Kaypro 2 with ComRiter diasy-wheel
            printer, original manuals
     1    Osborne 1, condition unknown

These items probably make sense only for people in the greater Boston area
or for people who can take delivery at the Trenton Computer Festival in
April.

                     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   Next, there is the software.  We will start with the CP/M items.  There
are lots of copies of MicroPro packages in sealed, shrink-wrapped boxes.
Most were originally for Apple CP/M.  I opened one of the boxes and was able
to read the diskettes using Uniform and my special disk controller.  Thus,
there will be no trouble converting the contents over to just about any other
CP/M format.  People who have purchased these have been very satisfied.

   The additional CP/M software items include:

      1   WordStar (MS-DOS for TI Professional)

                     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   We still have a few books left from the large original collection.

   Among the more interesting items were a lot of accessories for the HP-41

Has Alpha Systems gone bust? Or have they lost their inet address?
I recently sent mail to Joe Wright (alpha@netcom.com) with a
query about NZCOM in response to his plug in the Digest in
December. I have had no reply.

If anyone has an up-to-date inet address for Alpha Systems,
please reply to me directly. Thanks.

Subject: QX-10 is back from the Dead!
Message-ID: <10804@tamsun.tamu.edu>

A few months back, I came to c.o.cpm with a problem:  My QX-10 had just died!

Thanks to the help I received from Wayne Sung (sung@concert.net) who did
long-distance diagnosis with me via e-mail, and George Worley, a fellow QX-10
enthusiast and SysOp of "PIC of the MidTown" BBS in Houston, TX [(713) 527-8939]
who loaned me his Technical Manual, I now have the CPU back up and running
just fine.

The problem turned out to be bad filter capacitors in the power supply.

I had first come to c.o.cpm asking bout the hard disk that died on the QX-10.
That project is now back on.  I received a second drive mechanism from a fellow
member of our very small Houston, TX CP/M user's group.  I installed it and ran
the ComRex ComFiler diagnostics and everything checked out.  I then proceeded
to format the disk.  (The original mechanism refused to format.)  After about 30
minutes the formatter declared ***DRIVE FORMATTED AND READY FOR USE***.  Every-
thing appeared to check out and I saved a couple of 0-length files on the disk.
I then parked the heads and turned everything off.  When I turned the system on
again, the Hard Disk was dead.  It would not read, write or format.

NOTE:  The recommended shutdown sequence demanded by the documentation is
       CPU first, then Hard Disk.  If this is not generally accepted, I will
       happily disregard the manual.

I have since had the opportunity to connect the mechanisms to a MeSsy-DOG
machine where they format (low-level), partition, and format (DOS) just fine
and they operate flawlessly.   Unfortunately, I did not have the QX-10's hard
disk software with me when last I had opportunity to check the mechanisms on
the QX-10 itself, so I'll be doing that this weekend.  I'll post my results.

Thanks in advance for any additional help you can provide.

Check for many (17) holes in the index ring. If 1 hole, it is soft-

One of my hobbies is reading those old things. If you are a glutton
for punishment, the thing can be read with a uart and some fancy
programming. If you want to pursue this course, look for some old
H89 disk-controller diagrams and the H89 bios code. It works.

Good Luck.

You received the case and backplane for an S-100 computer.  The CompuPro 816 
was (is) a multi-CPU computer, with an 8-bit (probably) Z-80, and a 16-bit 
device (I don't know exactly what kind of CPU's are in it).  As a complete 
unit, the machine supported two 8" 1.2M floppies, operated MP/M __and__ CP/M 
simultaneously, and supported at least two users.

This information is third- or fourth-hand.  A friend of mine 
(rrobinson@orion.arc.nasa.gov) owns an 816, and has operated it a few times. 
He might have docs for it, and may be willing to trade his for something.

	On a trade, I received this beautiful case (approx 17"W x 20"D x 7"H)
labelled on the front as : "CompuPro 816" by VIASYS. It has a large
transformer in a power supply delivering +10 VDC, +18 VDC, and -18 VDC
under no load. There is a passive backplane with twenty-one 100 connection
slots that are each about 7.5" long. Is this an S-100 bus backplane?

	Any information you can provide on this case would be welcome.

	Thanks.

Subject: need help with Z80 Box
Message-ID: <MBAUR.92Mar9164640@russell.ira.uka.de>

Hi all,

Last week I got a mysterious box labeled "dfe BETA". It seems to be a
CP/M box manufactured by a german company (dfe). But all I have is the
hardware. NO floppies, no manuals, etc.

Is there anyone out there, who can provide me with hints,
documentation, software or even a working system disk?

Description
-----------

solid case containing 
	- big power supply
	- main board with 2(!) Z80 CPUs
	- floppy controller card
	- 2 floppy drives 5.25''

and following connectors:
	- DB 9	(unknown purpose)
	- DB 25 seems to be a serial port
	- DB 37 for monitor and keyboard 
	- DB 37 (unknown purpose)

The german keyboard is like all other components in a metal case and
has it's own Z80 CPU. I also have an additional board which connects 
to the bus and plugs between main board and monitor/keyboard. I found
that this board containing one more Z80 ;-) implements a hardware 
based debugger (ever seen something like that?!) which I can use e.g. 
to trace the bootstrap. 

When switched on the box beeps, does its selftest and then prompts with
"IPL:" for a boot device, which defaults to "D1". If I type "F3" or
"F4" the corresponding floppy drive is activated and the head makes
a little move before beeping again.

Any ideas are welcome because I'd REALLY like to get this machine up
and running. Thanks in advance,

Markus (mbaur@ira.uka.de or s_baur@iravcl.ira.uka.de)

Joe Wright has recently moved to the east coast. You should give him some 
time to get resettled. In the meantime you can get information about 
NZCOM and related products through Sage Microsystems. Jay Sage frequents 
these parts or you can send email to him at sage@ll.mit.edu.

BTW, Jay is out of town for the week.

You are mis-informed regarding most 8080/Z80 machines having the boot ROM
at 0000.  At least for those that run CPM - certainly the TRS80 is an
example of a common machine for which your statement is true.  If you can
call BASIC the boot ROM :-)

Anyway, most machines that run CPM have the boot ROM in high memory, usually
at F000 or F800.  Various hardware tricks are used to get the CPU to start
executing at that address.  My personal favorite was elegant simplicity
itself, needing only an 8 bit buffer and a single flip-flop.  Whenever
reset was pressed, it set the flip-flop, which enabled the POJ buffer and
disabled the normal data bus buffer.  The 8 bits were forced to a NOP value,
and the Z80 started cycling through the addresses.  When the decode line
for the BIOS ROM went active (the Z80 had stepped through every address
from 0 to the first byte of the ROM), then the flop was reset, enabling the
standard buffering to the CPU.  It was particularly elegant because most
other schemes require not only a higher parts count, but that the user
must set *two* addresses when addressing the BIOS, one for the BIOS itself,
and one for the POJ.  Note that at 4MHZ it doesn't take long to step through
a 64k address space one instruction at a time :-)

The most brute force method requires lots of parts and is really terrible,
IMHO, but I suppose is the most 'politically correct' method.  It is
probably the method that would be approved by most CS departments. :-) :-)
It is basically a state machine that forces three bytes on the bus in response
to the first three instruction fetches: a C3, a 00, and an XX where XX is
set by some dip switch or jumper block.  This literally is a direct jump
instruction that starts execution at any 256 byte page in memory immediately
after reset.

There are a number of other schemes out there, I only described the best
and the worst of the common implementations I have seen.

Get CRLZH20.LBR (the latest version I'm aware of). Several other extrac-
tion tools will also handle LZH compression but this is the one I use.

Is it really that easy to increase the clock speed, just change the
timebase crystal?  Even assuming all the ICs could handle the increase in
speed, wouldn't any of the firmware be time-critical andd need to be
re-written?

Whoa!  Are we talking Boot ROM, or are we talking the BIOS?  A number CP/M
machines *DO* have boot ROM at 0000h.  For example, the Xerox 820 series boots
at address 0000 with the Boot ROM enabled, transfer the BIOS from slow ROM to
faster RAM at F400 using a block move, then jumps to Cold Boot, which swaps out
the the ROM, leaving RAM at the lower address.

Your "cycle through the addresses" is not at all elegant, though it is a cheap
and dirty solution that works.  The above method I listed is not "brute force"
as you might have sugested.  It simply needs an additional flip-flop (in I/O
space) to determine if the lower memory bank is ROM or RAM.  The Z-80 takes a
lot less time to block move a few K of BIOS code, than to cycle through all the
address space.

For that matter if you wanted to keep the BIOS in ROM, it is real simple to
build in banked memory.  When you power up (or reset), the ROM is at both
locations 0000h *AND* F000 (or F800).  You then jump to Cold Boot, and part of
that swaps out the Shadow ROM at 0000 and puts RAM in it's place.  Again, this
is simple, "elegant", and requires little hardware.

I would assume that the boot ROM, as in most 8080/Z80 machines is at location
0000.  If the 803H is like the TPCI, it uses port 13H to bank-switch between
ROM and RAM, and the top 16K of RAM is not switched.

I'd be very careful to run diagnostics for several hours before
trusting the machine at a higher speed.
(diagnostics that test all CPU functions, memory,
and as much of the interface chips as possible).

When I was designing a Z80 system, I knew that I had 2 cycles for
memory read/write, 1.5 for opcode fetch so I bought chips
that would just meet that timing (allowing for memory decode).
Go any faster and the memory would probably start giving some
garbage results but only for some locations.
The peripheral chips may act strange.
The Zilog I/O chips need to see the 2 byte sequence for
"RETI" (return from interrupt) to reset the interrupt daisy chain.
If they miss that sequence at the higher speeds,
the I/O system may hang.

So try it, but carefully and be aware that ANY part of the system
may react.

BIOS wait loops are possible, but I had hoped that the CTC
(counter timer circuit) was used for timing, particularly since
the Z80 was so nicely interrupt driven.

Hello,

I recently installed ZCPR 3.3 on my old CP/M box. The ZCPR stuff was
all retrieved from SIMTEL20, <CPM.ZCPR33>. It works fine, but there
some things not clear to me from the documentation in the mentioned
directory:

 1- Is Echelon still going strong and is it possible to obtain the
    ZCPR3 manuals. If so, how do I, living in Europe, order those
    manuals?
 2- I would like to replace BDOS as well. Is there a document in which
    the various BDOS replacements are described and compared with one
    another?
 3- Why does GSUB20 not work with ZCPR 3.3? In some respects, I like
    it more than ZEX.

Thanks in advance for any answers,

Way back when, I was working with a terminal server that used a Z80 as the 
processor.  In order to get 19.2Kbaud, full duplex on both ports, we had to
upgrade to the 8 Mhz Z80 processor.  At the time, it was brand new and we 
received some of the first engineering prototypes.  It was a direct
replacement and none of the code had to be rewritten.  Anything timing related
was handled in hardware and no timing loops in the code were used.  However,
we did run into one major problem.  It seems that although Zilog made a 
processor that ran at 8 Mhz and all of the other supporting electronics could
handle that rate, Zilogs DMA chip would not run any faster than 4Mhz.  This 
was a problem.  In order to make things work we had to develop a sort of 
automatic transmission that would shift the clock rate down from 8Mhz to 4Mhz
everytime we accessed the DMA chip.  It worked liked a dream and everyone was
pretty proud of the accomplishment and when we showed it to Zilog they asked,
"Why would you want to do that?", response "Because you don't make an 8Mhz 
DMA!", ...."oh"...  I guess they never thought of that.

I have had a number of Z80As running at 6 or even 8 Mhz. At times I run out
of Z80Bs and have to use a Z80A as a temp measure. The problems you can get
tend to be random, infrequent and  usually terminal. In most cases if a Z80 is
to fail at the new speeds, you find out in 3 or 4 seconds after trying it.
One point to note. If the clock speed is incresed, the actual speed of a system
may be slower. Someone said recently that they designed circuits using memory
that just met the Z80 timing specs. If you are using wait states in the cicuit,
a small increase in speed may actaully require you to add an entire wait state
and hence slow the system down!!!. A small point I know, but if you have to 
find this one out the hard way it takes hours.

Also a question. ---  Has anyone done this with a Z80B if so is there a limit
due to heating as I have been told - I don't like destructively testing Z80s.?

Subject: CP/M on an Apple II
Message-ID: <1992Mar23.151028.13651@meaddata.com>

I run CP/M on an Apple //e with a Microsoft Premium Softcard //e installed.
This card is a 6 MHz Z80 coprocessor, 64K memory expansion, and 80-column
combination card that fits the AUX slot of the Apple //e.  However, I'm in
the process of migrating to an Apple IIgs, which doesn't have an AUX slot.
I'd like to know if there is a high-speed Z80 card that will work in one of
the standard slots of the IIgs, preferably without disabling the built-in
function of the slot or slowing down the system speed.  I've heard of an
"AppliCard" (or something like that), but don't know anything about it or
where I can get one.  I'd consider buying such a card from someone, or
trading the Softcard for it and a normal 64K/80-column card for the //e.
Thanks!

   I would not expect ARUNZ to be doing anything with interrupts, but I have
not looked at the source code yet to check.  Are you perchance now using the
type-4 version of the program?  All type-4 programs have DI and EI
instructions as part of the address relocation code in the type-4 loader,
which occupies the second record of the COM file (bytes 80H to FFH).  I
believe that this code cannot work with interrupts enabled because of the way
it uses the stack pointer.

   If you want interrupts to be disabled at all times, then you can simply
replace the EI opcode with a NOP (00H), and your problem should go away.  You
will have to do this with any type-4 program you intend to use.  The easy way
to do this would be to take the T4LDR11.Z80 source, take out the EI opcode,
assemble it to a new HEX file, and MLOAD it over all type-4 programs before
you use them.  Alternatively, you could simply stick with the type-3 versions
of the programs.

   I should point out that versions 3.3 and later of ZCPR also have parts of
the code that turn off interrupts and then reenable them.  This occurs in the
part of the code that asks for directory passwords.  Unless you were running
a secure system, you probably would not have stumbled upon this.

A Rainbow 100A is much more than a CPM machine. It contains both a Z80
and an 8088 processor and can run CPM 80/86 or MSDOS. It was designed
before the IBM PC had become an industry standard and therefor is not
IBM compatable. The differences are in the way it handles the screen
keyboard and disks. The disks are RX50's and are 80 track 10 sector
single sided for 400K bytes each.  A driver exists that will allow
an IBM AT class computer to read and write the RX50 formated disks.
At one time there were Rainbow support groups all over the country.
There are still many of these units being used.
Text only programs written for the IBM PC that access the screen
and keyboard using DOS calls will run on the Rainbow.

W.J.M. Nelis recently asked a number of questions about ZCPR33.

>> Is Echelon still going strong and is it possible to obtain the ZCPR3

   No, Echelon has been out of business for several years now.  Several
companies have taken over from them.  One of the most active, run by my wife,
is Sage Microsystems East.  You can communicate with SME through me.  SME has
"ZCPR3, The Manual" ($20) by Richard Conn and the "ZCPR33 User Guide" ($15)
written by me.  However, by far the best source of information about modern
8-bit computing is The Computer Journal, a bimonthly magazine.

>> I would like to replace BDOS as well. Is there a document in which the

   Many of them have been discussed in The Computer Journal.  I think that
most people would agree that the state of the art is ZSDOS/ZDDOS.  However,
it is a commercial product ($75, $60 if ordered along with NZCOM).  There is
probably a range of opinions as to the best choice from the non-commercial
BDOS replacements.

   I can't answer this one, as I have never heard of GSUB20.  What do you

or SUB)?

Don't worry about your English, it's far better than my Russian.
As for help on CP/M there's lots of people here who can help
out.

Before I answer your questions, I want to be sure I know what you
want: are you trying to find out what functions are available
in the CP/M BIOS and what are available in the CP/M BDOS?

As for software there is a lot around, although I don't know
how easy it will be to access it from Russia. Hopefully someone else
in Europe can post something about FTP or mail server sites over there.

You are mis-informed regarding most 8080/Z80 machines having the boot ROM
at 0000.  At least for those that run CPM - certainly the TRS80 is an
example of a common machine for which your statement is true.  If you can
call BASIC the boot ROM :-)

Anyway, most machines that run CPM have the boot ROM in high memory, usually
at F000 or F800.  Various hardware tricks are used to get the CPU to start
executing at that address.  My personal favorite was elegant simplicity
itself, needing only an 8 bit buffer and a single flip-flop.  Whenever
reset was pressed, it set the flip-flop, which enabled the POJ buffer and
disabled the normal data bus buffer.  The 8 bits were forced to a NOP value,
and the Z80 started cycling through the addresses.  When the decode line
for the BIOS ROM went active (the Z80 had stepped through every address
from 0 to the first byte of the ROM), then the flop was reset, enabling the
standard buffering to the CPU.  It was particularly elegant because most
other schemes require not only a higher parts count, but that the user
must set *two* addresses when addressing the BIOS, one for the BIOS itself,
and one for the POJ.  Note that at 4MHZ it doesn't take long to step through
a 64k address space one instruction at a time :-)

The most brute force method requires lots of parts and is really terrible,
IMHO, but I suppose is the most 'politically correct' method.  It is
probably the method that would be approved by most CS departments. :-) :-)
It is basically a state machine that forces three bytes on the bus in response
to the first three instruction fetches: a C3, a 00, and an XX where XX is
set by some dip switch or jumper block.  This literally is a direct jump
instruction that starts execution at any 256 byte page in memory immediately
after reset.

There are a number of other schemes out there, I only described the best
and the worst of the common implementations I have seen.

Sorry for the delay.  My copy of the CCS documentation for cp/m 2.2
only reproduces the DRI documents.  It includes no ccbios.asm BIOS source 
except the skeleton that DRI provided to all their customers.  Sorry.

On the other side, re: disassemblers, I had two ideas:

 (1) I found a Z80 dissassembler on OAK's SIMTEL mirror:
     OAK.oakland.edu, /pub/simtel20/msdos (I think), as
     /pub/simtel20/msdos/disasm/dasmz80.arc (whew)
     I haven't ftp'd it nor tried it, but the name looks right.

 (2) Many BIOS were written with 8080 instructions, only.
     Do you _know_ you need z80 instructions decoded in your
     BIOS?  (Naturally, you may need a z80 source if you intend to 
     patch it with z80 opcodes.)

larry@lfergus.UUCP (Larry Moore) asks:
> What's the address of  the boot rom on a TeleVideo 803H?

Contrary to what at least one persone believes, the boot rom on the
Televide is at zero. It's accesses by writing some code in the top
16K of memory that outputs zero to port 13h, this pages out the TPA
and pages in the boot rom. Output a 1 to port 13h to page the TPA
back in.

As for where you'd put this code, I've got a couple of suggestions:
On a standard 803 (dunno if this'd work on an 803h), BDOS starts
at (I think) CA00H - this means the space from C000 to C9FF is
available. The other place that is handy for hiding things away
is the GSX buffer: this is 128 bytes long, lives in the BIOS
(EA00H or higher) and is pointed to by the word at FF00H. Take a
look at the standard 803 QTERM code in QTERM.Z to see how to
shove something into that space.

To the post on the available CP/M System Disk.  I couldn't reply to your
message.  It was aborted.  So I'm trying this route to contact you.  

In your listing of available CP/M disk I don't see anything for the 
Commodore.  I have a Commodore 128 with CP/M 3.00.  I'm just learning 
how to use this os and would appreciate it if you could give me any
info on where to get any software.

Message-ID: <19148@sybase.sybase.com>

There is absolutely nothing to prevent you from plugging a standard
S-100 disk controller into a NorthStar. You have to write a BIOS
which recognizes both the NorthStar & S-100 disk controllers. Yup,
you heard right - two disk controllers in one box. I know somebody
who did just that.

A few caveats.

IMHO the Horizion is more S-100 compatible than you think. :-)
I've had no trouble with mine. However, some of the signals are on
non-standard pins. For example, I had to move the refresh signal on
my SDS D-Ram boards, plus another signal (XRDY or PSYNC, I think).

NorthStar RAM is dynamic, and refreshing is done in a bizzare fashion.
DMA disk controllers (I think) won't work. You must use a wait state
based controller. I'm doing this from memory, so take a good look at
the schematics.

The NorthStar ridiculously puts its boot PROM at E800. Make sure that
memory stays free. You can put stuff above it, say at F000, but don't
stomp on the boot PROM. It is on the NS Disk controller and takes
about 256 (or 512, I forget which) bytes.

This weirdness limits you to a 58K CP/M. Your re-written BIOS may cut
that down a little further. I suggest moving the BIOS into the EPROM
socket on the CPU card and putting above your CP/M at F000.

All in all, an excellent S-100 beast.  My sincere Thanks to Curt Mayer.

I have some information on OASIS and the company that still (as of a year or
so ago) supports it.  I'm sure that there were a number of S-100 machines 
that it was ported to, but the only one that I know of first hand was by
NNC (so called No Name Computer) Electronics in the L.A. area.  OASIS, of 
itself, was a multiuser operating system, rather in the vein of MP/M.  I 
think that THEOS was rather more the PC compatible implementation of OASIS.
I need to dig out some information from a text that I have, and will e-mail

Your most important considerations are memory access times and D-RAM

replace it. I upped my KAYPRO II to 4 MHZ this way. I didn't even have

Subject: Epson QX-10 HD problem update.
Message-ID: <11493@tamsun.tamu.edu>

For those who have been following my QX-10 saga, I have more to report on my
hard disk problems.

I said before that the mechanisms I have work just fine on a MS-DOS machine
with an Adaptec ACB 2010A controller.

When operated under the ComRex system with WD1002-5D Rev. Y controller, the
drive passes its seek test (very audible) and the standard diagnostic software
claims that the controller passes all of its register tests.

Attempting to format the drive, however, results in the drive being unreadble
by anything--Epson or MS-DOS machine.

I got different format and verification programs from a fellow QX-10 owner
whose system uses exactly the same hardware.  this program does about the same
thing.  It sits on each cylinder for about 17 seconds, then moves on.  During
the verification phase, it returns the following error message:

WD1000 ERROR = 10  CYLINDER cccc  SECTOR ss  HEAD hh  ALREADY LOGGED

Starting with cylinder 0001, the message at the end is only 'LOGGED' for the
first sector of head 0 only.

It repeats the message(s) above for the first 5 cylinders after which it
aborts.

The stand-alone verifier returns the same message(s) except says 'WD1002 ...'

Can anyone tell me what ERROR = 10 might be and the significance of the
different '[ALREADY] LOGGED' messages.

Thanks for the help.

The files with z in them are "crunched" using LZW techniques, very simular
to UNIX compress. The ones with the "q" are "squeezed" with Huffman encoding
There are many programs that deal with these files look in the same place
you found the files for an area labled "starter" or LIB-ARC or something
like that. The programs I use are UNCR.COM and USQ.COM or NUSQ.COM .
Most of the PD areas on the networks or BBS's have a "STARTER" area
where you find uncompressed and unarchived versions of these programs
along with introductory text that explains how to get started.

Who's got the CP/M FAQ list?
(Note to Usenet newcomers: FAQ means Frequently Asked Questions, and almost
every newsgroup has a list of these.)

Files with .?q? filenames are "squeezed" (a very old form of compression).
?z? files are "Crunched" (Names ending with AZM might be either crunched, or
written for the Z80MR assembler).
A newer form of file compression is produced by a program called CRLZH, and
has file names ending with .?Y? .
Any of these types of files can be placed inside a LBR file.  There are a
few different programs to extract them.  My favorite is LT30.

Shouldn't this code be examining the current interrupt state before it
goes changing them?  I mean, if interrupts aren't enabled, it should
detect this and not enable them when it gets through the critical
section of the code.

Bridger Mitchell had some examples for doing this in The Computer
Journal, Vols. 36 & 37.  Be sure to see both articles, because the
second has a work-around for a Z80 that the code in the first article.
Specifically, if an interrupt occurs while your code is checking the
interrupt status, the Z80 will wrongly report that interrupts are 
disabled.

On the other hand, the code to do this might not fit, either in the
Type 4 header or in the command processor.
