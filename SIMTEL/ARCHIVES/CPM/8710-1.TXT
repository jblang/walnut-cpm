Subject: New files uploaded to SIMTEL20 during September

The following is a complete list of CP/M-oriented files uploaded to
SIMTEL20 during the month of September, 1987.  The column labeled "T"
(Type) is the file format.  (7) means ASCII, (8) means binary.

For a complete list of all CP/M files, see:
   PD:<CPM>CPM.CRCLST - Complete list with CRC values
   PD:<CPM>CPM.ARC    - The above, ARChived (much smaller), binary(8).
   PD:<CPM>FILES.DIR  - Abbreviated list with only directory and file names
   PD:<CPM>FILES.IDX  - Similar to below, no descriptions, comma delimited

There is currently no complete listing of all files, with descriptions.
That is in the process of being created and will be announced when
available.  In the meantime, see PD:<CPM.FILEDOCS>CPMOCT01.LST (ascii)
or CPMOCT01.LZT (crunched) which is a complete listing of all CP/M
files on GEnie, each with a one-line description.  Since SIMTEL20 and
GEnie have many of the same files, this will be a very useful listing.
It is updated monthly.

Note: to save space in the following listing, the device name PD: which
normally appears ahead of the directory name has been omitted.

To: info-cpm@SIMTEL20.ARPA
Message-ID: <12339577737.19.BUDDENBERGRA@A.ISI.EDU>

Got a problem with printer overlay and RAM.

My copy of Wordstar CPM Version 4 arrived a couple days ago and I agree with
the reviews seen here -- looks like a winner.  A lot of the public domain
auxiliary programs like indexing, table of contents, ascii'fying, etc
got rolled up into the main program.  Footnoting does seem to have been
left out though.  O well, this is a word processor, not yet a desktop
publisher.

Anyway, to my problem.  
Hardware: AMPRO Little Board running ZCPR3.  Printer is a Daisywriter
which is a clone of diablo/qume/NEC daisy wheels (can emulate any of
them by DIP switches.)

Specific problem.  With the installed printer driver (any of the choices)
I get a 'Can't use that printer.  Incorrect name or not enough memory.'
error.  The optional printer drivers (e.g. DRAFT) work ok.  

It appears that I probably have a collision in RAM between some o the ZCPR
stuff and the printer driver, but I'm not yet sure.  Anyway, I tried
the memory squeeze trick to no avail (in WSCHANGE).  

Anybody got ideas or cures?  The book solution isn't much help....

Problem solved, sorry to have bothered you all.

For thos who might encounter the same...WordStar Vers 4 comes with
a whole pot full of printer drivers.  The WINSTALL program rolls them 
all up on the menu and invites you to pick one -- seductively easy.
But not complete!

The Program distribution disc has a printer .OVL file with about 4
drivers on board.  If the one you niavely install is in this .OVL
file, fine and dandy -- but most of the drivers are in the BIG
library (~150k) and on another disc.  Consequently, the opaque
error message that says that the driver you are calling up ain't

Fix.  In the installation fine print, page xxii of the manual.
(Yeah, I know...).  You rebuild the working .OVL to include the
drivers you intend to use -- including the one you 'installed'
in the WINSTALL.

Subject: Memory Partitions in CCPM
Message-Id: <6601@robin.cs.nott.ac.uk>
Sender: info-cpm-request@simtel20.arpa
To: info-cpm@simtel20.arpa


I wonder if anyone can help me with a problem with memory partitions under
Concurrent CPM.

At the moment I have a Jarogate Sprite (a 286-based machine), running CCPM 4.1
with half a megabyte of memory.

With a previous version of the OS (I think 3.??) I could run all my programs
fine, but now I've got the upgrade, I keep getting "Insufficient Memory"
when I try to load programs.

I've tried to re-partition the memory into larger chunks, but this was
spectacularly unsuccessful - it wouldn't even run "SDIR" then!

The problem has also appeared on other machines which I am responsible for
(also CCPM), so I would like to get some idea about what the problem is,
and what I can do about it.

The particular program which is causing the problem is "runcobol", which is
a runtime for RM/COBOL programs (I don't program in COBOL myself, you
understand, I just look after the machines!) - according to the (limited)
info from RM, it requires a 64K data segment + text + stack.

I'm definately NOT a cpm guru, so I'd appreciate any help you can give me.

Please respond directly - I don't get the chance to read the news much, I'm
too busy re-partitioning my machines ...

Cheers,

Subject: Possible WS 4.0 bug
Message-Id: <909@uhccux.UUCP>
Sender: info-cpm-request@simtel20.arpa
To: info-cpm@simtel20.arpa

Correct me if I'm wrong, but it seems that I may have found a possible
bug in WS 4.0.

I have just finished installing the new WS for a multiuser system that
we have here at our college.  Because we have an oddball selection of
terminals (some new and some old), I had to take the lowest common
denominator for the monitor selection.  The old terminals (Mime 2A's)
have problems with line insert and delete control codes, and thus
I had to install it without those codes.  Seemed to work fine until I noticed
that the screen didn't update correctly when I was in the middle of
an already present paragraph and added some more text until the word
wrapped.  The word just typed appeared in the right place, along
with the text that was trailing it, but the line that was below it stayed
in the same place and did not move down like it should.  Hope you
can follow that (!).  In any case, it seemed that nothing I could install
for the terminal changed the situation.

It would seem that in a case like this that it would be the WRAP toggle,
in which the cursor does or does not move to the next line after a character
is written in the 80th position.  It was off like it should be (in my case).
Also, it works fine when the line insert and delete codes are installed,
but this only works on the other terminals, and not the Mimes.  Anybody
know what is going on, or did I overlook something?

Thanks for your help!

Please forward to any other dls which might be able to help.

Points to comment on:

1.  Physical parameters: size, weight, display type, built-in mass
storage, built-in modem, built-in printer, battery internal or external,
period of operation on battery, A/C power converter availability, etc.

2.  Software/CPU parameters:  CPU, bytes of RAM, operating system and
compatibility, operating speed, software included (i.e. Wordprocessing,
spread sheets, modem programs, etc.).

3.  Manufacturers/Distributors, including phone # and/or address, if
possible (so I can go straight to the horse's a** (oops) mouth if I want
to).

4.  Price or price range.

5.  Can the system function as a fax, either through software or
hardware?

6.  Options: external monitor, external printer, external keyboard,
external mass storage, more memory, etc.

6.  Anything else I haven't covered that you think is significant.

   I received the following question from Ken Wallewein.  Since the answer
may be of general interest, I am posting it to the entire list.

   I wonder where you read that ZCOM is a low-class way to go.  It's true
that it does not give a programmer a chance to display his skills at
modifying his BIOS and reconfiguring the operating system.  It is also true
that ZCOM offered less flexibility in the definition of the system (it had
RCP, FCP, NDR, and IOP buffers of a size determined by Joe Wright).  And
finally, ZCOM does cost an extra 0.5K of TPA compared to the same system
installed manually (assuming the manual system has cleverly written BIOS
modifications).
 
   However, we have a new version of ZCOM in the works, called NZCOM, that,
in my opinion, will make manually installed systems undesirable and
obsolete.  Right now, for example, I am having trouble getting WordStar 4 to
run on my system (manual installation) because there is not enough TPA.  If
I had ZCOM, I could just drop out of ZCOM and run WS4 under CP/M.  Under the
new NZCOM, one will be able to create complete Z-System configurations
dynamically, on-the-fly!  When you want to run WS4, an alias script justs
commands the system to drop any RCP and IOP and to go to a small FCP while
WS4 is running.  This might give you back up to 4K of TPA.  When WS4 is
finished, the alias could automatically restore the original, more complete
Z-System.
 
   When you want to make use of an IOP, like NuKey, for example, you invoke
a NuKey loading alias.  It checks to see if the current system supports an
IOP of the necessary size.  If not, it commands the system to allocate space
for and initialize an IOP.  It then loads NuKey, and away you go!  When
you're done, you can tell the system to drop the IOP if you want to recover
the 1.5K of TPA.
 
   This kind of freedom will cost only 0.25K of TPA in any given system
compared to an equivalent manually installed system.  That is a VERY small
penalty to pay for the freedom gained.  It is even possible that because one
does not need any ZCPR3 code in the BIOS coldboot routine, the BIOS might
become shorter, and the net penalty might even be zero.
 
   In summary then, the autoinstall approach is not at all a low-class way
to get a Z-System, and with NZCOM it will become the smartest way to do it,
because it will give by far the most powerful implementation.  No more will
you face the dilemma of whether the features of ZCPR3 are worth the cost of
the TPA lost.  You will be able to trade off features and TPA on a command-
by-command or task-by-task basis.

<BTW, this is a IEE-696 system.

I'm not familiar with the IMS line - or only vaguely so. I'm going to
work on the assumption that it's similar to other S-100 boxes.

Since it's an IEEE-696 system, I assume that all your boards are IEEE.
Given that, the # of routes you can go depend on how much work you're
willing to do to upgrade.

First comment - you won't be able to go to "real" 32 bit operations.
IEEE-696 has hard limits of 16 data bits, and 24 address bits.  You
might be able to find someone with a 32-bit S-100 card that deals
16-bit data, but I'd be surprised.

Route 1, the high road. Buy a card set from some S-100 company, tweak
it to talk to your drives. Shouldn't be to painful. Finding the
company is the hard part. I'd try Viasyn, as they appear to be the
best company still in the S-100 business (or in business the last time
I looked).

Route 2, the low road: Buy a cpu-card only, and write the drivers you
need for it to talk to your disk controllers. Not recommended unless
you're into writing device drivers or are a masochist.

Other options live between the two - like buying only CPU, FDC and
serial card - or skip the serial card if you can find an FDC with a
spare serial line. Use that to get the system running on the floppies,
and then write your own hard disk driver.

The nasty part of this is that, as of the last time I looked, the cost
of one card (new) was about the cost of a low-end "appliance" 16-bit
system. For instance, you can get an Atari ST 512 for ~ $400, the
Amiga A500 for ~ $600, or an IBM PC clone for ~ $500. Given that, I'd
be seriously tempted to sell the IMS system (sans the HD) for what you
can get for it, and buy one of the above (I like the Amiga, but the
others might be better for your purposes) plus a controller for the
HD.

That is the route I finally took. The Amiga was almost exactly the
hardware configuration I was looking for, didn't have the flakiness of
five-year old hardware, and had *much* nicer software than I could get
for the S-100 hardware. Plus spiffy graphics/sound/mouse.

MNPROP2 is version 2.0 of the popular H.F. radio propagation prediction
program MINIPROP for CP/M computers by Sheldon Shallon, W6EL.  This
program allows entry of the latitude and longitude of two locations
between which the minimum usable frequency for ionospheric (skywave)
propagation on frequencies between 3 and 30 MHz will be calculated.
This is really an oversimplified description of the program as it
provides much more detailed information than just the MUF.  An atlas
is available as well as the ability to generate compass point MUF.
Printer support is included.  No source code is provided but
comprehensive documentation and an executable .COM file are included
in the LBR.

This file is also available on my RCP/M and on GEnie's CP/M RoundTable.

MNPROP2.LBR			BINARY	113280  864CH

MNPROP2 is version 2.0 of the popular H.F. radio propagation prediction
program MINIPROP for CP/M computers by Sheldon Shallon, W6EL.  This
program allows entry of the latitude and longitude of two locations
between which the minimum usable frequency for ionospheric (skywave)
propagation on frequencies between 3 and 30 MHz will be calculated.
This is really an oversimplified description of the program as it
provides much more detailed information than just the MUF.  An atlas
is available as well as the ability to generate compass point MUF.
Printer support is included.  No source code is provided but
comprehensive documentation and an executable .COM file are included
in the LBR.

This file is also available on my RCP/M and on GEnie's CP/M RoundTable.

	I got the MicroPro offer for WordStar 4.0 in the mail the
other day; and I must say, for $89 I will seriously consider.  My CP/M
machine is an ATR-8000 (anyone ever hear of THAT?), which normally
functions as a smart drive/modem/printer interface for my Atari 800XL.
It has 64K, so I'm wondering if WordStar will fit.  I've got CP/M ver.
2.2 (same as CP/M 80?  I dunno).  Can anyone answer the size question
based on this admittedly limited system info?

Is  anyone  familiar  with the Commodore CBM-700 (B-128/246) that
was marketed in Europe a few years ago.  I have purchased one  of
these  systems  and really like it.  The manuals specifify that a
8088 coprocessor can be  installed  to  run  CP/M-86  and  MS-DOS
software  (I  think  the  term is concurrent co-processor).  Does
anyone know how this would be done?  The books lead me to believe
that is is a fairly simple procedure.

Any assistance would be appreciated.

Thanks in advance

First of all, unless a version of CP/M for the 64180 is the only one that the
Wordstar 4.0 will run on, you shouldn't have any problem and even then it
would still be working as a banked system.  In gerneral, all versions of CP/M
through 3.0 (CPM/80 or CPM Plus) are limited to 64K.  Unless Wordstar is
itself close to 64K in size there should be ample TPA to hold the Wordstar
program and a significant amount of text.  Wordstar will shuffle text between
disk and memory as necessary to be able to handle whatever size file your disk
can handle.
And your ver. 2.2 is not CP/M 80.  CP/M 80 is version 3.0 or CP/M Plus
which is designed to run on a Z-80 machine.  This is not to say that you
can't run CP/M 80 on your ATR-8000 but it would have to have a Z-80 processor
running it.
Best,
Bob

WS 4.0 may or may not work.  The important figure isn't how much memory
your computer has -- almost all CP/M computers have 64K total memory.
What's important is the size of the Transient Program Area (TPA), which
is the amount of memory available to application programs after the
amount taken up by the operating system (yes, CP/M 2.2 is the same as
CP/M-80 -- the newer version, CP/M 3.0, is usually called CP/M Plus).
     
Here's what the READ.ME file on Disk 4 of my CP/M WS 4.0 disks says:
     
  "WordStar requires a minimum TPA size of 50 kbytes to run
  using the factory defaults.  The TPA is the amount of memory
  available in your computer for use by programs that have a
  file type of COM.  To see how big the TPA is in your computer,
  press the question mark key (?) at the Opening Menu.
     
  The amount of memory required by WordStar can be reduced by
  approximately 3 kbytes if necessary.  Use the WSCHANGE program
  to select the minimum memory configuration option.  The menu
  will show you what capabilities are being reduced.
     
  WordStar uses a general-purpose buffer for a variety of
  tasks.  WordStar allocates memory to this buffer for editing,
  for merge printing, and at the Opening Menu (see BFSIZE in
  PATCH.LST).  The buffer used for editing is usually the most
  sensitive to a reduced TPA size.  (You may be able to use the
  Opening Menu and print, but there may be insufficient memory
  for editing.)
     
  The merge print buffer is used only to hold merge print
  variable names and data.  Increase it if you run out of memory
  while merge printing."
     
The file goes on to say that you can save 2.5K by not using merge-
print.  You can also patch WS to use less memory for the buffer
mentioned above, using the information in the file PATCH.LST.
     
I don't know whether your very unusual hardware configuration will
influence the size of your TPA or how CP/M works in any quirky way.
Either of those could keep WS from running properly.  Another problem
could arise if WS doesn't directly support either the terminal screen
codes or printer interface/protocol setup that your system has.  If
your system emulates one of the common terminals, such as the ADM-3A,
Hazeltine 1500, Televideo 950, Osborne 1, Soroc IQ 120, etc., you
could just install WS for that terminal.  Otherwise, you'll have to
enter the cursor positioning codes, codes for inserting/deleting a
line, etc., one by one when you run the install program.  The other
possibility is that you may have a hard time getting your printer
to work properly, especially if it is a serial, rather than parallel,
printer.
     
One other consideration is that Micropro may or may not be able to send
you WS on a disk that your computer can read.  If I were you, I'd find
out (if you don't know already) what disk format your machine uses.  If
it's something common, like Kaypro 2, Kaypro 10, Xerox 120, or Osborne,
you're O.K. Otherwise, you'll have to have the program sent in a
"foreign" disk format and then get it translated to a format that your
machine can read.  If you have any problems, I'd be glad to transfer it
for you if you send the disks to me.  So, if necessary, send me a note
telling me what format your machine uses.  If they send WS to you in
Kaypro 2 or Kaypro 10 format, I can probably transfer it to the format
that you need.
     
Please don't take the above to mean that I don't think WS will work for
you.  I just mean to say that you may have some technical issues to
resolve.  If any of the above is too technical, or if I've written it
murkily, please send me a note and I'll try to elaborate further.  Good
luck.

Subject: Z80MR query

I have come across something which puzzles me concerning Z80MR.  Source code
for ASM.COM as follows works OK:-
        IF     NOT MEXPLUS
                .
                .
        ENDIF

For a Z80MR source file I would have expected the following to be equivalent:
        IF    .NOT.MEXPLUS
               .
               .
        ENDIF
This does not seem to perform the .NOT. operation on MEXPLUS.  However, the 
following does work for Z80MR.
        IF    TRUE.AND.(.NOT.MEXPLUS)  etc
As this performaed the .NOT. operation properly I woondered whether
        IF    (.NOT.MEXPLUS) etc would work.  However, it does not.
Does anyone have an explanation.  The .DOC file for Z80MR is not very 
informative on this subject.

Does anyone know if there is a CP/M version of ARC or PKARC?  I keep seeing
.ARC and .ARK files on various BBSs, but I can not find the animal that
creates them.

I've checked these out, and they are not MS-DOS .ARCs.  These are CP/M
programs that have been put into a .ARC format.  I have a program (UNARC.COM)
that will "unarc" them (it also works on MS-DOS .ARCs) but it does not create
them.

I have seen mentions of a program called NOAH that is supposed to create these
files, but it doesn't appear on any of the BBSs that I frequent.

Any information (especially about where I can get a copy of this program)
would be appreciated.  Thanks.

There are several library utilities for CP/M.  Some of the best known
are LU.COM, NULU.COM, and (I believe) LAR.COM (though I could be wrong
about the last one).  As far as I know, however, they create files
with .LBR as the extension, not .ARC.
     
I'm sure that you can get these from any Kaypro User Group, and probably
from the C Users' Group in Kansas, as well as on a number of RCPM's and
BBS's.  When I have time (it's 2 a.m., and I'm at home right now), I'll
check in my office and see if I have any further info.  Good luck.

The other die-hard S-100 company is Cromemco (now a wholy owned subsidary of
Dynatech). Biggest problem is their boards wander on some of the details of
IEEE-696 compliance; once in a rare while you may have some incompatability
problems. But their S-100 boards tend to be much more *useful* that Viasyn
boards, which often combine oddball features that are difficult to use. If
you run Cromix, you can even add drivers for your peripherals with relatively
little pain, although you'll need some kind of supported disk drive to boot
the thing first.

Cromemco does have an S-100 68020 card; it runs the memory over a private bus
and uses the S-100 just for I/O. Of course, you have to buy Cromemco's memory
cards for it, too.

[Disclaimer: I obviously don't work for Cromemco, nor do I have any interest
in the company.]

The B-series computers have an internal co-processor port as well as
an expansion port.  An 8088 board could be installed internally, rather
simply as you suggest.  You should peek inside- some B256-80 machines came
with the co-processor board standard.  The hard part is finding one of these
boards and/or the software.  

The is a very persevering user group, CBUG, which is into the B-series
computers in a big way.  They have even interfaced them to the 1571 disk
drives which provide them with easy access to CP/M software.  I highly
recommend them.  For information, write:

Gee, I _think_ the ATR has a Z80 in it.  What are the other

 A big "thank you" to you and the others who replied to my query.  The
ATR is not such a non-standard machine, so I assume WordStar will fit.
Also, it can read many popular disk formats, incl. Kaypro and Osborne,
so no problem there, either.

 I have two more questions:

a) Is WordStar's screen-updating tolerable when used with an ADM-3A terminal
(which is what the Atari emulates when talking to the ATR)?

b) What is the reasoning behind the two-drive requirement?  Why can't
you get along with only one drive?  This question asked for the benefit of
a friend with a Commodore 128, and only one 1571 drive.

Actually, any comments from C128 users running WordStar 4.0 would be
appreciated.

  Thanks,

WordStar v4 will fit just fine within 64K.  Especially since
this is the maximum amount of memory that CP/M 2.2 will
support.

I've got an ageing s100 bus computer with two 8" disk drives and a 
terribly buggie CPM operating system.   The darned thing's pretty fussy,
but I bought it eternities ago (used, my first computer), and I'm
kinda fond of it -- especially since I used it to write the guts of a book. 

Now, I find myself with a wondrously more reliable, nicer-to-use 
HP series 150 type II, with two 3 1/2" micro-floppy disk drives, and MS-DOS 
operating system to use at home.  You guessed it:  I'd like to transfer 
all the material stored on my 8" diskettes onto my new system.

So far, with the help of techie friends, I've succeeded in reading the 
8" diskettes onto my HP screen, but not capturing the data onto the 3 1/2" 
media.  I'm having my RS-232 cable and port checked to verify that the 
protocols are compatible.  But once that's done, I'll need a CPM version 
of **** KERMIT ***** to send the data files over the line 
from CPMland to MS-DOSdom.

Is there any kind soul out there (froggie or prince(ss)) who might have 
a CPM version of kermit? (I'd prefer 8" diskette version, but could have any 
CPM version read onto 8" diskette, if need be.)

Thanks a 'pond-ful' for your help!!

Karen, if you have a modem program like CROSSTALK, QMODEM, PROCOMM,
MEX-PC, GT, ZCOMM, etc. (anything that will do the "Xmodem" protocol),
running on your MSDOS machine you can use any version of MODEM7, IMP,
or MEX on the CP/M machine to transfer files through the RS232 line.
You didn't say what kind of CP/M machine you have.  As you may know,
there are considerable differences in the hardware used on various
types of CP/M machines.  One would have to know the port addresses and
status bits to configure either Kermit or MODEM7 for the CP/M machine.

Hmmmm.  You may have trouble with this one.  I have KERMIT for the Kaypro
and Xerox, but it is not "nice"; KERMIT has all kinds of problems transmitting
any files with non-ASCII characters (such as found in unstripped WordStar,
dBase, Supercalc, etc.)

I would *strongly* suggest that you obtain Xtalk (Crosstalk) or some similiar
PD modem program (MEX?) which handles the XMODEM protocol for you HP150.
First of all, every system I come across these days supports it; second, with
the 1k packets, it blows away KERMIT for file transfers; third, it handles
*all* files.  If you don't have at least one modem program for your 8" CP/M,
I have at least 5 different flavors of it in source and object - just plop in
your driver.

Of course, I am presuming that you are going to use your HP150 to talk to
other systems.  In particular, if you are going to contact any BBSes, you will
need XMODEM support if you wish to upload/download any files - most BBSes do
NOT support KERMIT.

-Mitch

If *all* else fails, I also have the source to KERMIT in C buried around here
somewhere.

I don't know what version of Kermit you have but Kermit has absolutely
no problems transmitting all 8 bits, since it has a quoting facility to
translate everything into a printable subset of ASCII. The host
operating system may have problems storing the files, but that is
another issue. I used to regularly transmit cross-compiled 8080
programs from Unix to my CP/M box with CP/M-80 Kermit.

The CP/M Kermit from Columbia U has a generic mode to use the IOBYTE
calls. This is slower, but for a one-shot effort, who cares.
Configuring CP/M-80 Kermit is not a problem. There are many types of
machines supported by the code and it was easy to find one close to my
box.

Karen, you can get CP/M Kermit by anonymous ftp to CU-20B as I did but
you would still have to get Kermit into your machine. I used XMODEM to
bootstrap.  I think the most hassle free way is to get an 8 in Kermit
diskette from some helpful soul.

To: info-cpm@simtel20.arpa 
Cc: SAGE@LL.ARPA 
Message-ID: <SAGE.29441399@LL.ARPA>

 
     The following is a reply to questions posed by Joe Loda several weeks
ago.  I am posting to the net for general interest.
 
     I don't know if anyone else stepped in to answer your queries about
ZCPR3.  I hope so, since I have been so busy the last several weeks that I
have not had time to answer mail.  I don't have much time now either, but I
will try to provide some very quick answers.  I have or will be covering
some of these things in my column in The Computer Journal.
 
 
  1).  Just what does an ECP do?  ARUNZ seems to be the choice, but I
       don't know why.  Is there any doc for ARUNZ floating about?
 
     The ECP (extended command processor) comes into play when the command
processor cannot process the command as a resident command in the CCP, FCP,
or RCP or as a transient command (COM file).  ZCPR3 then loads the
designated extended command processor file (typically CMDRUN.COM) and passes
the user's command to it as an argument.  Thus if you entered "DO SOMETHING"
and DO.COM could not be found, the command would run (almost) as if you had
entered "CMDRUN DO SOMETHING".
 
     You can rename any of a number of programs to CMDRUN.COM to serve as
the ECP.  Indeed, ARUNZ is the one of choice in my opinion.  More about that
later.  Other possibilities are:
 
    ZEX or SUBMIT       will automatically run a batch file entered as
                        a command name (as with SUB in CP/M3 systems)
 
    LX                  automatic extraction of the COM file from
                        COMMANDS.LBR
 
     ARUNZ is an alias generator.  There is a file ARUNZ.HLP on my remote
access system (617-965-7259, 24hrs, 300/1200/2400, PW=DDT), but few people
seem to have paid any attention to it (find it and other ARUNZ material with
the command "FF ARUNZ").  It is a little outdated at this point but should
serve as a guide.
 
     Basically, you create a text file called ALIAS.CMD with the alias
scripts you want to use.  Each line of the file is a separate script.  At
the very beginning of the line is the name (or names) for the script. 
Multiple names can be connected by '=', each name can have the wildcard
character '?' or a period.  Characters after the period do not have to be
present, but any characters that are present much match (see examples
below).
 
       A space or tab character separates the script name from the script
commands.  The script recognizes a wide range of parameters for performing
complex command generation.  Any command line token can be parsed into its
drive, user number, file name and file type components; system file names
can be substituted; memory and register contents can be read; the user can
be prompted for input.  The parameters are described in ARUNZ.HLP (though
there are a couple of new features not covered there).  Here is a sample
line:
 
        FINDF.ILE=FILE.FIND=WH.EREIS=WIS ff $*
 
This line will respond to any of the following user commands on the left,
translating them to the commands on the right:
 
        findf *.doc             ff *.doc
        where w*.*              ff w*.*
        wis arunz.hlp /e        ff arunz.hlp /e
 
The $* parameter in the script stands for the entire command tail.
 
 
  2).  Is there any documentation for the utilities?  I have ZCPR3, The
       Manual, but it doesn't talk about any of the new ones.  The .LBR
       files contain only update information (ARUNZ is a case in point).
 
     "ZCPR3, The Manual" is unfortunately quite out of date at this point. 
You can get some basic information about almost any ZCPR3 utility by
entering it with a tail of '//' (e.g., A0:BASE>PROGRAM //).  For more
detailed information, look for a DOC file with the distribution library or
read the beginning of the source code (even if you don't know assembly
language).  And don't forget to look around for a .HLP file.  The latter may
be in a separate HELP directory on many systems.
 
     Documentation is a real problem.  I don't have nearly enough time to
write all the code I can think of, so I tend not to spend the time required
on the documentation.  Several individuals who do not know how to write code
have volunteered to help with documentation.  Bob Frazier (I believe) wrote
the ARUNZ.HLP file.  I would love to have some additional volunteers!
 
 
  3).  Is there any summary of what all the various Z system utilities
       do.  As a novice to the Z world, I constantly see things like
       "a new version of ASDF has been released".  It would be nice to
       be able to look at a list and see a one line description of ASDF.
 
     If you call any one of the Z-Nodes and enter the FOR command, you will
get short descriptions of the files that have been uploaded to or placed on
the system.  Thus entering "FOR ASDF" might give you a quick description of
the program.  I am not aware of any compendium of such descriptions.  This
would be a very worthy project for someone who would like to contribute to
the Z community but perhaps cannot write code.
 
     Echelon at one time had an 8.5x11 card (front and back) with all the
commands, but I would guess that the card is rather out of date at this

I'm looking for a VT100 terminal emulator for a CP/M system.   I'd
prefer an implementation for a Xerox 820-I, writtne in either Small C

I  am  about  to  receive  an  8088  co-processor  for my CBM-700
(Commodore B-128) system.  According to the book, this will allow
me to run both CP/M-86 and MS-DOS programs.

I  have been downloading SIGM CP/M-86 files like crazy, but don't
know about any MS-DOS files.

To make matters worse, I am not sure what MS-DOS really is.   Can
anyone lend a hand?

Most  of  what  I am doing is for the club I belong to (Chicago B
Users Group, CBUG for short).

Any help would be very greatly appreciated.

Thanks, the ORPHAN machine!

Subject: CP/M software file server on Bitnet

I have made a few radical changes to the CP/M file server on Bitnet.
I will describe the changes first, then, for many of the newer people
on this list who never heard of the server, I'll review its use.

(1)  The server has been redesigned to use a disk "cache" for keeping
     only the most recently/frequently requested files online.  Requests
     for files not in the cache are deferred for overnight processing.
     The offline-to-online procedure is automated, but subject to
     delays; if a request cannot be satisfied in 5 days, the request
     is abandoned.

(2)  The archive is now more current than the former collection
     (which was dated 17 July 1987).  I will try to keep my server
     up to date with Simtel20, at least within a week or two.  This
     means very new files on Simtel20 will not be immediately available
     on my server, and the reverse for recent deletions.  Synchronizing
     my server with Simtel20 is a manual process I'll perform on a
     best-efforts basis.

(3)  THE SERVER IS STILL EXPERIMENTAL, AND INFORMATION ABOUT IT SHOULD
     STILL BE KEPT CONFIDENTIAL TO THIS GROUP.  Nonetheless, the archives
     have been expanded to include the MSDOS, PC-BLUE and SIGM collections.
     The server claims to recognize the ADA and CPMUG directories, but
     it lies.  (I had intended to include the CPMUG files, however, a
     problem with the CPMUG directory list has delayed this.)

(4)  The /PDDIR command is available for getting directory listings.

(5)  As before, if you have any comments, questions or problems with the
     server, direct them to FISHER@RPICICGE.BITNET (me), and not the
     Info-CPM mailing list.

*****************************************************************
*           Help information for the PDGET command.             *
*****************************************************************
     Selected portions of the SIMTEL20 public domain software
archives are available at RPICICGE.BITNET.  At present the
collections include the following directories:

     PD:<CPM.*>     -- The Info-CPM archive (CP/M machines).
     PD:<SIGM.*>    -- The SIG/M User Group archive (CP/M machines).
     PD:<PC-BLUE.*> -- The PC-Blue software archive (IBM PC's).
     PD:<MSDOS.*>   -- The MSDOS archive (MSDOS machines).
Planned:
     PD:<CPMUG.*>   -- The CP/M User Group archive.

Any of the files in these collections are available from the file
server LISTSERV@RPICICGE.BITNET.  The server responds to two commands.
/PDDIR requests a directory listing of files available in an archive,
and /PDGET requests a file from an archive.  The file server accepts
commands in both interactive messages or RFC822-style mail.  (On
VM and MVS Bitnet hosts, TELL LISTSERV AT RPICICGE... can be used to
send an interactive message.  Other Bitnet systems may have similar
facilities.  People on non-Bitnet systems must use the mail interface,
and must insure that the From: header represents a valid return path.)

****Note:  The server actually responds to many, many other commands,
           but none of them have anything to do with the archives.

The two commands have the following form:

      /PDGET  <format>  simtel.filename  < ( encoding >
      /PDDIR  simtel.pattern

The <...> mark things that are optional.

* "simtel.filename" specifies the name of a file to be delivered to the
    user.  Names are usually of the form "PD:<dir.subdir>name.type"

* "simtel.pattern" specifies a search pattern used in generating a
    directory listing.  The form of the pattern is like the filename
    mentioned above, but asterisks (*) may be used freely in the
    subdir, name, and type parts as wild cards (but not in the dir field.)

* "format" specifies the method of transmission to be used:

    NETDATA  -- suitable for transfer to Bitnet hosts that can accept
                files in IBM Netdata format.
    PUNCH    -- suitable for transfer to Bitnet hosts that can accept
                files but cannot decode the Netdata format.  Files
                are sent as 80-byte card-images.
    MAIL     -- suitable for transfer to hosts that can accept only
                mail or are accessible to Bitnet only through gateways.
                Large files sent via mail are split into several
                smaller files that the recipient must reassemble.
    If the format is omitted, NETDATA is assumed for Bitnet hosts
    and MAIL for all others.

* "encoding" specifies any special encoding of the file data:

    ASIS     -- suitable for hosts that can receive binary data.  The
                file is sent exactly as it is stored on my system:
                CP/M sector images, binary mostly.  ASIS may be used
                only with format NETDATA.
    UUENCODE -- suitable for hosts that cannot receive binary data.
                The file is sent uuencoded.
    TRANSLATE -- suitable for any host, but only when the file actually
                represents readable text.  The file is translated into
                character data format.
    If the encoding is omitted, files are sent ASIS if the transmission
    format is NETDATA, and UUENCODEd otherwise.

/PDDIR Examples:
================
(1)  The user is looking for the LASM program.
            /PDDIR  PD:<CPM.*>LASM.*

(2)  The user wants a listing of the full CPM collection.
            /PDDIR  PD:<CPM>

/PDGET Examples:
================
In each of the following examples the user wants the CPM.CRCLST file to
examine on his host and the UNARC16.ARK file to download to his micro,
both from the CPM collection.  Note that none of the examples have a
closing parenthesis!

(1)  The user is on an IBM host directly connected to Bitnet:
           /PDGET  NETDATA  PD:<CPM>CPM.CRCLST  (TRANSLATE
           /PDGET  NETDATA  PD:<CPM.ARC-LBR>UNARC16.ARK

(2)  The user is on a non-IBM host directly connected to Bitnet and can
     receive Netdata files:
           /PDGET  NETDATA  PD:<CPM>CPM.CRCLST  (TRANSLATE
           /PDGET  NETDATA  PD:<CPM.ARC-LBR>UNARC16.ARK  (UUE

(3)  The user is on a non-IBM host directly connected to Bitnet and can
     receive punch files:
           /PDGET  PUNCH  PD:<CPM>CPM.CRCLST  (TRANSLATE
           /PDGET  PUNCH  PD:<CPM.ARC-LBR>UNARC16.ARK  (UUE

(4)  The user is on some host somewhere:
           /PDGET  MAIL  PD:<CPM>CPM.CRCLST  (TRANSLATE
           /PDGET  MAIL  PD:<CPM.ARC-LBR>UNARC16.ARK  (UUE

Concurrent CP/M-86, M/PM etc.  Specifically, what microprocessors
are used with each and whether or not any are compatible with any
others.

$5,000 CP/M system for $500 plus shipping - hardware (paid over $2,500)
and software (paid over $2,500).  I no longer use this system and have
priced it for quick sale (each of the diskette drives alone are worth
the asking price!).

    Excellent physical and electrical condition, complete manuals:
	XOR S-100 mainframe with 4 slots (three used), power supply
	Zilog Z80A processor, 64 Kb memory
	Floppy controller handles 5.25" and 8" drives, any format
	2 1.2 MB (each) reliable 8" floppy drives (Tandon half-heights)
	2 serial ports (up to 19.2 kbaud each), 1 parallel port
	1 serial terminal cable, 1 parallel printer cable

    Software and manuals:
	CP/M-80 2.2, BASIC-80, Condor DBMS, Fortran 80 (w/M80),
	JRT Pascal, MAC/SID, Master Planner, MIX-C, Multiplan,
	Nevada Edit, NorthStar Basic, Random House Proofreader,
	Target Task, and WordStar

    1.2 MB DSDD Diskettes (all in black plastic library cases):
	Two Boxes (10 each) DSDD (w/public domain software)
	Five Boxes (10 each) DSDD (blank - 60 MB!)
	(plus 2 boxes mixed format commercial software)

    CP/M and Z80 books:
	CP/M Revealed, Illustrated Multiplan, Inside CP/M,
	MultiPlan Applications, Multiplan MicroRef,
	Programming the Z80, Proportional WordStar,
	Z-80 Microprocessor..., and ZCPR3 - The Manual

All that is needed for a great, working system is a terminal.  I'll
throw in a Liberty Freedom 110 which is in excellent physical condition
but has an intermittent power supply problem.  This is probably easily
fixed - I'm just not a hardware person myself.  The terminal has low
mileage, a manual and original shipping box.

Terms:  will not split, you pay shipping, will be shipped COD via UPS,
first come - first served (I frequently travel but I'll return calls
and e-mail in the order received).  Questions welcome.

To all of those with Tandy/TRS-80 Model I, III, or 4 systems.

Tandy abandoned support for their 8 bit computers a while back.  Now,
the news is that 80-Micro will be abandoning support for them as of the
January 1988 issue.
   To cope with the lack of support, several groups of authors and programmers
have gotten together and have created 2 things.
   The first is the TRS-TIMES news letter.  The first issue will be in
January and was originally only going to be about 5 pages.  At last count
there were near 20 or more.  This news letter will be a bi-monthly
publication and the authors are requesting a $15 subscription fee.
   The second is the TRS-LINK electronic magazine.  This will basically
be an electronic newsletter which will be distributed free of charge
through several bulletin boards and through GEnie.

   If anyone would like detailed information on either of these, please
send me a letter.  If you would like to receive a copy of TRS-LINK,
also send me a letter because I will be distributing it to BITNET,
ARPANET, and anyone else on the internet who wishes a copy.

Mr. Leon Williams, 
   President and Chief Executive Officer
Micropro International Corporation
33 San Pablo Avenue
San Rafael, CA 94903

Thank you, Mr. Williams --

for the excellent documentation and, especially, for the 
person-to-person assistance your organization has provided 
for purchasers of WordStar 4.0 upgrades.

In the process of trying to install the new version, I ran 
into a few minor problems and a telephone call to the number  
provided in the reference material got me on track 
immediately.  A couple of times my call was answered by a 
recording but I was never on "hold" for more than a fraction 
of a minute before a genuine live person was on the line.

Then I ran into a real problem.  My printer would not work.  
It had worked with my earlier version of WordStar; it should 
have worked now; but it didn't.  I want to let you know how 
much I respect your Customer Service Representative Kevin 
and appreciate the help he gave me.  It took several calls 
from me to him and from him to me, several conferences 
between Kevin and his advisor, and (I believe) a call from 
them to the manufacturer of my printer, but they didn't give 
up until they had determined that the printer initialization 
string needed modifying and I was back in operation.

During one of my conversations with Kevin, I happened to ask 
how many customer service reps were working there.  I was 
astounded at the large number and compliment you on how 
seriously you take the matter of client assistance.  Very 
literally, your staff made an intimidating job workable (in 
fact, almost easy).

I plan to upload this letter to CompuServe's CPM special 
interest group and to the Usenet comp.os.cpm newsgroup so 
that others can know of my total satisfaction.

                             Sincerely,

	There is also the Misosys quarterly for those Z-80 machines
	running LS-DOS. Good programming tips and interesting technical

I would contact the Heath User's Group (HUG) at 616 982-3838.  They
have a large library of User contributed software.  They also can
probably give you the names of some vendors that might have the type of
software you want.   Since that machine is at the far end of its life
cycle, perhaps you can convince them to donate some copies.  HUG also
has a bbd, at (616) 982-3956; though you might have to be a member to
download things; I'm not sure.

I missed the posting here of Small C as originally published in
Dr. Dobb's Journal.  I am looking for the C source or 6502 source
for a Commodore C-64.  I have a C compiler for the C-64, but it
would be nice to port the public domain Small C to the C-64.

       There are certainly a great number of programs out there that will do
       what you're looking for, but it would be very time consuming to pull
       them all together.  We have a BBS here in DC that specializes in CP/M
       and I have a ton of it for my two Teletek S-100's sitting here, but for
       primary grade children.... beats me.

Subject: Complete CP/M system for sale
Message-Id: <16181@rebel.UUCP>
Sender: info-cpm-request@simtel20.arpa
To: info-cpm@simtel20.arpa

$5,000 CP/M system for $500 plus shipping - hardware (paid over $2,500)
and software (paid over $2,500).  I no longer use this system and have
priced it for quick sale (each of the diskette drives alone are worth
the asking price!).

    Excellent physical and electrical condition, complete manuals:
	XOR S-100 mainframe with 4 slots (three used), power supply
	Zilog Z80A processor, 64 Kb memory
	Floppy controller handles 5.25" and 8" drives, any format
	2 1.2 MB (each) reliable 8" floppy drives (Tandon half-heights)
	2 serial ports (up to 19.2 kbaud each), 1 parallel port
	1 serial terminal cable, 1 parallel printer cable

    Software and manuals:
	CP/M-80 2.2, BASIC-80, Condor DBMS, Fortran 80 (w/M80),
	JRT Pascal, MAC/SID, Master Planner, MIX-C, Multiplan,
	Nevada Edit, NorthStar Basic, Random House Proofreader,
	Target Task, and WordStar

    1.2 MB DSDD Diskettes (all in black plastic library cases):
	Two Boxes (10 each) DSDD (w/public domain software)
	Five Boxes (10 each) DSDD (blank - 60 MB!)
	(plus 2 boxes mixed format commercial software)

    CP/M and Z80 books:
	CP/M Revealed, Illustrated Multiplan, Inside CP/M,
	MultiPlan Applications, Multiplan MicroRef,
	Programming the Z80, Proportional WordStar,
	Z-80 Microprocessor..., and ZCPR3 - The Manual

All that is needed for a great, working system is a terminal.  I'll
throw in a Liberty Freedom 110 which is in excellent physical condition
but has an intermittent power supply problem.  This is probably easily
fixed - I'm just not a hardware person myself.  The terminal has low
mileage, a manual and original shipping box.

Terms:  will not split, you pay shipping, will be shipped COD via UPS,
first come - first served (I frequently travel but I'll return calls
and e-mail in the order received).  Questions welcome.

I  would  like to thank all who provided answers to my questions.
I know that I missed a few in my direct replys.

Your information has given me and my club (CBUG INTERNATIONAL)  a
new capability that will prove invaluable.

Again, thanks to all.
