Message-ID: <111237@unix.cis.pitt.edu>

	Greetings.

	I'm getting a Z80 machine that I know very little about.
	It will come with 2 720K drives, 192K RAM, a Z80, and
	3 serial ports (1 for console). It is called:

	"Altos Computer Systems Z80 mini computer"

	It says, on the mother board, "615-11071-001 REV"

	I'm getting software with it, as well as a schematic. I think
	I know someone with an owner's manual - but I would like
	to know if anyone on this feed has one of these machines.

	I'm not new to CP/M as I have a Kaypro 10, 2 Osborne 1's, and
	a Sol-20 (that I finally got to boot CP/M 2.2 :-)

	I would appreciate any comments (both positive and negative)

	Take care.

I just read an article in the January Computer Journal about installing a
Bernoulli drive which looked interesting.

there is just one small problem.  What is a Bernoulli box and where whould you
find one?

Subject: Apple II/III CPM communications prog?
Message-ID: <12312@pasteur.Berkeley.EDU>

I have just acquired an Apple /// and am thinking of using the /// as a
terminal to log on to Unix on the Mac (direct connect).  So I need to look 
for a terminal
program that emulates the VT100 and supports preferrably Kermit file
transfer.

Now I have spent quite a lot of time working on CP/M on the Apple II and
still have quite a few CP/M disks (but not term programs).  I was going
thru the Sun Remarketing catalog which has a SoftCard ///.  Since the only
Apple /// program that I know of that supports VT100 emulation is the
Access ///, I'm really thinking of getting CP/M running on the ///.

From what I know, SoftCard /// seems to be the same card as SoftCard for the
II except that the OS is patched to work on the ///.  Will I still be able
to run Apple II CP/M programs (I mean use the same disks) on the ///?  How
much memory does Apple /// CP/M support since it sure addresses a lot more
than the APple II. I believe I wouldnt be able to boot off an Apple II
CP/M disks but hopefully I can run programs directly.

Next is what comm program should I use?  I've seen references to QTerm etc.
And I vaguely remember names like CrossTalk (I wasn't into those things
when I was using CP/M on the II).


Thanx

There's a sneaky way around this that should do wonders:  If
you're on a big enough machine with enough memory, you
precalculate all possible 8-bit adds and subtracts, with and
without carries, and a couple of basic logical operations.  You
end up with a small pile of 128k tables-- which is just fine in
this day of 4 MB SIMM modules.  The entire addition or
subtraction, complete with flags register, is reduced to a table
lookup.

All this to emulate a 64k machine running an 8k operating
system...

Are you the person responsible for the Japanese CP/M emulator
running on the Sun at math.purdue.edu?  Do you know where I can
get the source to that thing?  I'm occasionally working on my own
emulator :) and I like to see what other people have done.

I'm responsible for the CP/M emulator running on 128.210.3.18. I
imported the source
from utsun in Japan a year or so ago, and managed to get it to run. The
docs were
in kanji and didn't print! 
  I'm willing to post the source, but the documentation on hooking it up
to a cp/m
binary system is very incomplete. It only does 8080 code, and I don't
have any PD 
CP/M replacements in strict 8080 code, so it's running DRI CP/M 2.2 out
of the box.
The bios is a stub of course.

I have an Epson PX-8 (Geneva I believe) that I might part with.

It has 64k ram, micro-cassette drive, basic, wordstar, calc, cpm

Within the last months people regulary talk about either running Unix
versions of CP/M programs or emulating CP/M under unix.

I would like to get a CP/M emulator running on our machines (Sun 3 & Sun
4), but I haven't succeded in finding one that I could make run (within
a reasonable amount of time :).

I therefore request of those who are in the process of creating such
beasts to email me, with ftp-download instructions.

After testing each briefly, I will compile a list and post it here in
comp.os.cpm.  Details will follow

I did a little checking, the controller is labeld WD1000 (like how many
othert hard drive controllers...) the cable connecting it to the system is
NOT a standard SCSI, the interface might still use a similar protocol, but
I doubt it.  We do have the pretty common looking large brown cermic chip
at the bottom, but it isn't labeled coherently, there are what looks like a
couple o Western Digital PALs floating around, as well as a few other PALs.
	I have been able to substitute other drives, and that did
work, sort of...  The only problem s that is it painfull to end up using 15
megs of a 40 meg drive...  I would sooner dissassemble the sysgen and
re-engineer the bios than waste that much space...
Thanks for your ideas though, I might end up doing that anyway...

You have a ZEUS 4, I have one myself, it is a nifty little machine, it is
both CP/M and MP/M compatible.  Inside you will find three cards.  On eis
the HD controller, the middle one is the master cpu and the last one is the
slave CPU board.  On the slave board there should either be 2 or 4 entire
z80 based computers.  Theres are all "Networked" to the master board
througha 20 cond ribbon on the side.
	Connect your terminal to a different port on the back of the
computer, the one marked U1C and you will be able to use it in multi user
mode.  There is a login password system, so you might have to find out what
the passwords are.
	I have a copy of the documentation for the O/S and I have a Z4
sysgen program for a 20 meg drive.  If yoou are interested E-Mail me and I
will be happy to help in any way I can.

	I am STILL looking for tech docs for the machines though, sigh...

I've become interested in playing with color graphics.  Since I have an

Cromemco made a card called the Dazzler, which apparently was *very*
low in both color and pixel resolution.  I've also seen reference to
the SDI, which may simply have been the order model number for the
Dazzler.  In either case, these boards have the advantage of being
known to work in my machine.

A quick search of back issues of Byte magazine revealed that the only
other likely choice is a Microangelo, which was produced by Scion, of
California.  They stopped adverising it in late 1983, and started
promoting a similarly-featured board for the IBM PC.  One of the nice
things about this board was that one could install multiple boards to
increase color resolution.  They listed for about $700 each.  

Does anyone have such a board they'd be interested in selling, or know 
where I might locate one?  I'd also be interested in a color terminal 
(slow, but it works).

Subject: Sanyo MBC-1000 Interrupts
Message-ID: <1991Apr3.204502.19423@batcomputer.tn.cornell.edu>

Greetings:

I've come up with a use for my Sanyo MBC-1000 that
requires a fairly good idea of the passage of time.

Since it has no clock (or does it?), I was going
to write myself characters at 300 baud with an isr
to update a counter and start over (seemed like
a good kluge at the time.)  But looking at the 
schematic I saw an 8253-5 interval timer just sitting
there doing nothing and was delighted to think I 
could do it right.

So I can load the timer and read the contents, but
I need to keep track of each time it times out 
timer 1, every half hour or so.  It looks like this
can be done by setting it up to generate an interrupt
and incrementing a counter in memory, but I don't
see how all this works by looking at the schematic.

I can do it by polling the timer values in a 
keyboard-idle loop, but would prefer to try the
interrupt route first.

Can anybody give me a rundown on how to go about this?

Thanks,

   Eliot

I am unhappy to relay the following message, which I download 
from the Drexel Hill RCP/M.  Irv Hoff was one of a select circle 
of CP/M gurus.  He authored much of the software that we CP/Mers 
use on a regular basis.  Even though he has most recently been 
involved in IBM, he will be missed by the CP/M community.

Anyone know where I can get PICS bbs software? Last I was aware of was
PICS16.

Along this same line, anyone have a used copy of Turbo Pascal for CP/M
for sale (along with the manual). Preferably on Kaypro 5.25 format, but
I would love it on 8" SSDD also. Cheap, btw... since I am only going to
use it for the PICS stuff, I really don't want to pay full freight via
Jay Sage (although the price is reasonable through him, it is too high
for a one-timer <grin> ).

Thanks, y'all.

   not to mention, cp/m on a chip.
 
   add a disk controller, some rom, some ram, and other odds and ends
and you'd have an extremely low parts count  cp/m machine.

Message-ID: <sic1Z3w164w@ersys.uucp>

  Pete Pardoe of Truro, N.S has disassembled and updated the work of a 
fellow Canadian, Dave Rand, for Z-System users.

  His implementation of NSWP is called ZSWEEP.

  Pete's release notes follow.  The file -- ZS10.LBR -- is available for 
download from my BBS at +1 403-454-6093 (300-9600 bps [HST], 24 hours).

  If the keeper of the net's CP/M archives would be kind enough to 
provide an address, I'd be happy to send a copy there as well.

                         -----

ZS10.LBR  contains ZSWEEP 1.0 which is NSWP207  disassembled  and 
converted to a Z system utility.  

 It has full support for named directories the ability to execute 
or  act upon the current file and a psuedo Z system  prompt  from 
which  you may execute any valid Z system command line up to  127 
characters in length.

 It requires ZCPR 3.3 or later with an extended TCAP as specified 
by VLIB4D.  

 The current release does not support user areas above 15, due to 
the  fact  that my system is Z3PLUS which does not  support  user 
areas above 15 so I was unable  to implement user areas 16-31. 

 However  Bruce  Morgan  has graciously consented  to  assist  in 
bringing this feature to ZSWEEP so expect it in the near future.

The  release  of this program has the blessing of Dave  Rand  for 
which I express my gratitude to him.

Gerald,

I currently sell the MIX C Compiler and Turbo Pascal 3.01A, both 
for CP/M. 

The MIX C Compiler is a complete K&R implementation of the C 
programming language.  System requirements are:
     CP/M 80 (2.0 or higher)
     55K Memory
     2 disk drives or HD
     Z80 CPU
Price is $20.00 plus $5.00 S&H in contenental US (CA must add 7% 
sales tax.)

The Turbo Pascal (for CP/M) is identical to Borland's product 
though it is now distributed and supported by Alpha Systems.  
System requirements are:
   CP/M 80 (2.2 or higher)
   64K RAM
   1 disk drive
   Z80, 8088
Price is $60.00 plus $5.00 S&H in contenental US (CA must add 7% 
slaes tax.)  From time to time I get 'used' copies of the Turbo 
Pascal 3.0 which I sell for about $30.00 plus $5.00 S&H.

I hope this provides the information you need.  Take care.

Hi Guys,
Some questions for you:
1.) I need help from a CPM-Guru on the C128 using the 1781 in CPM-Mode,
installing a printer, etc.
2.) Can anyone tell me if there's a PD-List for C128-Software, which I
can reach via Internet. (Simtel20 is Known :-))
3.) Has the Royal-Oak Server a Internet connection?
4.) Is there another PD-Softwareserver for CPM on the Internet? (I always
have troubles to reach Simtel20 because of a slow line here)
5.) There was a discussion about the program RDCBM21. I have lost the
userid of the writer of this fine program. I would be glad to get the userid
or better the source code.
Regards to all who can help me. Martin Vogler
PS: Many thanks to Keith for the very good service of the WSMR-SIMTEL20 server.

Subject: Wyse terminals
Message-ID: <CMM.0.90.2.671246589.ephillip@magnus.acs.ohio-state.edu>

Does anyone know  anything about Wyse terminals, and how they
interact w/xerox eauipment? Specifically, are they dumb terminals,
or do they have the cpu's in the box like other xerox equipment? I
have a xerox 820-II dual 8" floppy drive that I'd like to get
going. Can I do it w/one of these terminals? Also, if anyone needs
one, I have just obtained 6 of these terminals w/keyboards.

Ok, now on to #2:
Does anyone know anything about TRS-80 Model 12 computers? This
has a screen on the left side, and a single 8" floppy drive on the
right, all in the same box. I understand that this was a business
machine, supposedly quite expensive in its time. Does it run TRS-DOS?
Where can I get a boot disk/software for it? Would Simtel20 have
anything for it? I also have 2 12-meg external harddrives for it, BTW.
 
Any info will be appreciated!

I object to this posting as being misleading.  A typical card cage is not 
angular enough to make a good anchor.  Anchors need to dig into the bottom.

Prior to the advent of personal computing, Irv Hoff was active in amateur
radio RTTY, and made as many contributions to furtherance of that art as 
he made to PC software.  I am not particularly well read in either field,
but I recall seeing Irv's name often; I suspect a list of his accomplishments
would be too long to post.  I personally benefited from his disk utility
(I think it was DU), for the Osborne 1.

I had the pleasure of but one RTTY QSO with Irv in the mid-to-late 60's.
His spirit and energy will be hard to replace.

Message-ID: <8EF142A6C33F0018E6@ucs.uwplatt.edu>

[NOTE:  The following was originally posted on the BitNet list COCO@PUCC -
 Tandy Color Computer discussion.  Given the recent discussion on floppy
 disk systems, this might be usefull to others on this discussion -- Lance]
 
                        Adding 3.5 inch Drives
 
These drive, as sold by most vendors, use 80 tracks, double-sided, and store
720 Kbytes of data.  They are electrically the same as a 5 1/4 inch floppy
drives and can easily be added using the 80 track drives that have been
included with OS9 Level II. Also, several companies are selling adapter kits
to allow you to install these in a 5 1/4 inch drive enclosure. This is the
best way to go, but -- like me, many users will prefer to install them as an
addition to their current system instead of a replacement.
 
DRIVERS
-------
 
As I said above, any of the drivers that are included with Level II can be
used as long as the 80 track descriptors are included in your bootfile for
the new disk drive. Microware has thougtfully provided descriptors for drives
/dd, /d0, /d1, and /d2 in 80 track double-sided format. All you need to do
here is make a new bootfile with the proper descriptors installed.
 
HARDWARE
--------
 
The 3.5 inch drives use a different cable connector than the 5 1/4 inch units.
These are a 34 pin dual-header type connector with the same pin-out as the 34
pin edge card type. HOWEVER, these drives are also capable of receiving their
DC power through the ribbon cable, which is how Tandy powers them in their
new computer line. There is also a 4 pin power connector that my be used
instead. But, DO NOT provide power using the 4 pin power plug without
removing some of the pins from the 34 pin header type ribbon connector. If
you do, you will be grounding the power supply through the disk controller
card which will result in some major damage to the power supply, the
controller card, or both. If you use the 4 pin power connector, you must pull
all the ODD number pins from the connector, i.e., pins 1,3,5,7....etc.
None of these lines are used for any disk control signals so don7t worry
about that.
 
Addendum:  Not all 3.5 inch drive manufacturers provide power to the
34 pin connector.  On those drives that don't, there is no need to remove
any pins.  However, if you are not sure, remove them anyway to protect
your power supply in case you are wrong.
 
The 4 pin power connector is wired in the same was as the older drive
connectors, with 12VDC on one end pin, 2 middle pins for ground, and 5VDC on
the other outer pin. You should ake sure which outer pin is for 12V and which
is for 5V before providing power to them or damage will result. My drive was
marked for the proper pins, but some may not be.
 
 
INSTALLATION
------------
 
Being a practical minded (i.e. CHEAP) person, I installed my drive in a small
experimentors box, and tapped the power and the 34 pin connector off my
current dual disk drive package. Unless your current drives over-tax the
unit's power supply, this should be safe as they use so little power
themselves. So far, I have not noticed any power problems nor any increase in
the heat output of the power supplies voltage regulators. I haven't yet
measured the current draw, but I expect it to be very small.  The 34 pin
ribbon cable connector was easy to find at the local Radio Shack store, but
the 4 pin power connector was not. So, I took another header connector and
cut it down to only 4 pins and used that for now. Later, I suppose I'll get
the "proper" one, but it's been working fine.
 
You should buy a new 34 pins ribbon cable and three 34 pin edge card
connectors that are designed to clamp on the cable. Measure at what points
you need to add the one or two connectors for your current drives, and then
add whatever lenght is required to extend the cable to the location of the
3.5 inch drive. Then, simply clamp the connector on.
 
I installed the drive on my system as drive /DD and am surprised that is it
noticably faster than my older drives. I then set the step rate to 6 ms using
DMODE, saved the changed descriptor back to disk, and COBBLER'd a new boot.
At
this step rate, all they do is "buzz" a little when accessing.
 
Eventually, I'll get another and have 1.4 meg of storage in these two tiny
units. The disks themselves are much easier to use, you need not be as

The last time I've handled CP/M was many years back on the Apple II so I'm
kinda rusty and outdated about current developments.  Now that I have this
beast called an Apple /// with a Z80 card, I'm thinking of getting it
something decent to run.  I was looking at wsmr-simtel20.army.mil which has
a huge collection of CP/M stuff but which is extremely slow (any alternatives
closer to the Bay Area and fast?)

Well I'm interested in the following:

1)   A terminal program that provides for VT100 emulation.
2)   What is ZCPR and what does it really provide?  I vaguely remember it as
     a kind CCP replacement with extensive abilities but was kinda bloated for
     my needs then.  How about an improved CCP?  I like one of those that
     don't require you to restart from a system disk (I mean warm boot).
3)   A decent screen-oriented text editor.

The problem with the Apple /// is that it is next to impossible to find
support for it.  It is therefore important that the programs are fairly
machine independent (not even the Apple II ones will help).  Preferably, if
necessary, there's a simple means for me to hack up some connection with
standard Apple /// SOS device drivers.

My current setup has the Apple /// directly connected to the Mac on a serial
port.  So presumably I download stuff using the Mac, how do I get it to
Apple /// CP/M because I dont even have a single program that can do binary
file transfers on the ///.

I also notice a lot of .?Z? files and .LBR files.  Where do I get the
files to extract these?

Thanx

QTERM42G.LBR will be the file you're looking for.  It provides
decent VT100 emulation.  If you're running CP/M on an Apple II
series with the ORIGINAL SoftCard, you'll find a driver that I
wrote myself for that system.

Try ZDE16.LBR.

If I only had the address for it, Sun Remarketing in Utah is an
excellent place to start as they specialized in the "orphaned"
Apple systems.

*.?Z? are "crunched" files.  You use either UNCRUNCH or UNCRLZH
(whichever will work; if at all possible, go with UNCRLZH because
it handles *.?Q? ("squeezed") and *.?Y? (LZH-compressed files)
.LBR files are analogous to *.ZIP, *.LZH, et al in the IBM
world, and Binary II files in the Apple II world.  For those, you
would use NULU, but I prefer LT29.COM because it not only types
files inside of a library, it also decompresses and extracts
files.  You don't have to worry about cluttering your drive with
secondary compressed files like you would if you were using NULU
which handles *.?Q? files only.

Sad to read that W6FFC is now a Silent Key.

I knew Irv from the late 70's, when he pioneered integration of
PCs (Heathkit H-89, etc.) with Ham RTTY.  One of his inventions
as I recall was an extended RTTY code, with LTRS-NULL shifting
to lower case.

Irv was a leader in the RCPM movement that paved the way for today's BBS
community.  He developed IMP (Irv's Modem Program) which was for many
years the culmination of assembly language comms programs for CP/M.
Irv worked tirelessly to help users bring up comms programs on their
CP/M machines, no two of which supported the same comms API.

I still remember Irv sending HEX program dumps over 20 Meter RTTY to
fellow hams back in the 70's.  73...

Subject: Re: STD Bus
Message-ID: <8190011@hp-lsd.COS.HP.COM>

STD bus was designed around Intel 8085 bus signals.  That gives
you the following signals:
   A0-A15 for 64k of memory;
   D0-D7  8 bit data bus
   IO/M*  select between memory or I/O
   a couple of interrupt lines
   reset
   clock

Notice I show a de-multiplexed Address/Data bus.  De-multiplexing
is performed on the processor card.  This enabled Motorola-based
processors to implement STD as well.  I forgot to mention R/W
in the signals above.

I once designed and implemented a system based around STD for
an unnotable government subcontractor.  It worked, it was
cheap.  It was easy to replace parts if needed.  It was
modular, which is one of STD's design goals.  Just take a
cpu card, add enough memory cards for your app, add I/O.
Complete system.....Just add firmware.

Message-ID: <1991Apr18.135845.4914@ips.oz.au>

Hello all.  Can someone give me a brief guide to writing overlays and
TSR-like programs for CP/M?  None of the books I have mention the topic,
and user groups died out long ago...  The system is a reasonably standard
CP/M 2.2 system (ZCPR-2 I think), running on a Z80 platform - the Australian
"Microbee", if you've ever heard of it.  Nice little box...

I gather one has to fiddle the top-of-memory pointer after relocating oneself
for the former, and trapping the keyboard-request jump for the latter, but
there my knowledge runs out.  What other things should I have to do?

Since I'm stuck with twin floppies (no provision for a disk without EXTENSIVE
modification), I'd like to use the 64Kb RAM disk that comes with the BIOS as
a small (but fast) paging area of sorts.

Thanks.

I just got an IBM disk drive from a low-end PS/2.
It has a 40-pin edge connector and no power connector.
As some of the traces on the edge connector look MIGHTY

Are the lower 34 pins the conventional 5.25" assignments?
What do the upper six pins carry?  39&37 are ground, and
   are tied to the same ground as 1,3,5..33
   35&36 are tied together.
The drive was made by Alps.

I talked to my local Zilog rep.  Of the Zilog distributors he gave me,
I tried Newark and Lex (800-833-3557).  Newark didn't have the Z84C13
IPC chips, and would require a large order for them to get them,
plus a long delay. Newark can do VISA, and carries the "standard"
Zilog chips (but so does Jameco/JDR, probably at a lower price!!).

Lex has the chips in stock.  I have placed a order.  They can do COD,
but no VISA.  They do have a $250 minimum order.  I paid about $18 for
my Z84C1310VEC (I think that is the proper number) chips.  They are
being shipped from San Jose.  There is also a 6Mhz version of this
chip.

As for Zilog SIO/SCC autobaud code, I'm still looking.............

Message-ID: <1991Apr19.021354.9766@trl.oz.au>

G'day all !

If this is not the right place to post this, don't flame me, just tell me
where to post.

I'm trying to help out my dad who has one of the above mentioned beasts
(the PCW8516). This thing comes with an expansion "port" at the back, which
is in fact just a connector edge of the internal pcb. Now he also has a
Heathkit H89, running cp/m, and would like to have the two machines talking
to each other. The expansion "port" of the PCW8512 has all the signals from
the Z80 (address, data, control). I figured that all I would need is something
like an 8251 or a Z80-SIO, plus the required TTL<->RS232 chips. Now before
I start reinventing the wheel, I'd like to know from anybody who might be
familiar with the Amstrad, whether they know if this is already available
from Amstrad, whether this might exist in kit form, whether this problem has
already been tackled and solved, and whether my assumptions as to it being
a simple h/w job are correct. BTW, I am an EE, so soldering is no problem :-),
although all the programming stuff might be a little bit more challenging :-)

Email me, or post, and I will send any "me too" requests a summary.
Thanks in advance for any help.

>>> ICL Model 35
 
These machines only supported a small number of different hard discs, 
model 25/26 - 5Mbyte with 306 tracks 2 heads.                       
model 35    - 10Mbyte with 306 tracks 4 heads.
 
DSKINIT will format to either of these, it should ask which you have. 
 Any drive with more than this in tracks or heads should work, but the 
extra will not be used, less tracks won't work.
 
Perhaps the Xebec has failed.  It's a SASI to ST506 convertor.  ICL 
wants to see a SASI drive, actual drive is ST506.

Help! I have an ICL model 35 computer running MP/M ver. 2.4f3. Recently
the hard disk died ( it was a 10 meg Rodime model RO 200 ) and I got
hold of second hand 5 meg Tandon model TM 501 to replace it. However it
doesn't work. I suspect I need to change the jumper settings on the drive.
So, If someone has details of the jumpers of the Tandon drive they would be
much apreciated. The hard disk controller in the ICL is a Xebek Systems
model 104526 (at least thats the only number written on it). The jumper
settings for this would also be good.

I can be contacted at paul@sal.sait.edu.au or you can post it to the

I'm writing from Georgia also, how can I get in on this deal?
Also, just what directory are the CP/M files on wsmr-simtel20 in?   
How could I get a listing of the subdirectories?
Any info for this new user would be appreciated.

	Greetings. I tried that with my Kaypro 10. I had a few 6 meg
	hard drives and I wanted to use them with my K10, which came
	with a 10 meg.

	The first problem was getting all the jumpers.
	The second and terminal problem was that my format
	program required a drive with 4 heads and 305 cylinders.
	Those are the specs for a 10MB unit, not a 6MB one - when
	I tried to format, it failed.
	And third, even if you convince the format program to format
	only 2 heads and 305 cyliners (5MB specs), how will you tell
	CP/M that? In my K10, CP/M can only access 8MB and the drive
	was split into A: and B: (C: for floppy). Well, I got it to
	format only A: but then ran a program that bombed because
	there was no drive B: (or something like that).


	SO:

	Get a new 10MB unit! For a new, expect to pay ~$70 and for a
	used ~$35

	Take care.

>Hello all.  Can someone give me a brief guide to writing overlays and

I think the information you need is in DRI's CP/M 2.2 Modification Guide,
but basically you have to do three things:

  (1) write your code so that it can install itself just under the
      [current] low-end of CP/M: since this is unknown until the TSR
      is invoked, it is easier to write for (say) a Z80 with some relative
      addressing than for an 8080/5 without such capability;
  (2) you must create a "thread" for whatever BDOS or BIOS calls you want
      to intercept, into a screening routine of your own -- probably
      you want to copy them all, and put a new set of pointers in their
      place which hits the corresponding targets in your TSR; and
  (3) you have to adjust the free-memory pointer so that the next TSR to
      be invoked doesn't clobber the earlier one(s).

The Sybex book _Mastering CP/M_ includes utilities to (for example) divert
printer output to a disk file.  These are probably reasonable examples.
I don't know if any compilers for CP/M give you enough control to do these
things.  Assembly language is probably required.

WARNING>> This is all conjecture: I never actually wrote a CP/M TSR.<<

John:  If you open the terminal up, there will be a third set of

Are there any Epson PX-8 users in New Zealand or Australia?  I am 
looking for a service center to send my PF-10 disk drive to for 
repairs.

Unless somebody can tell me why, after months of non-use, the PX-8 
stopped recognising the PF-10.

Wouldn't you know....  Purchased in the U.S., useless for years.  
Finally I find a disk transfer utility (22DISK from Sydex - absolutely 
the best) and an editor for both DOS and CPM (VDE - well worth the $15 
registration) making the little brick potentially useful.  Only now 
I've no disk drive!

Any help would be appreciated.

Hi, I don't know if I can help with your problem, but I was glad to see 
someone else has an Amstrad.  I have an AMSTRAD PCW8256.  I can't use it 
for bbs-ing because it requires an interface to hook it up to the modem,
which I don't have.
 
Harley Ristad, Amstrad Users Group, U.S.A., 12741 Matteson Avenue #3, Los
Angeles, CA, 9066, voice phone: 213/397-7981, runs an Amstrad 
users support service, which is free.  You can call him or write him.  He 
was very helpful to me once.
  
For the modem, he recommends a CPS8256 RS232C Serial Interface (from 
Sinotech).  
  
By the way, I am looking for an interface for the modem, so if you hear 
of anyone having one to sell, please let me know (or where I can get it).
  
PS:  Harley provides a newsletter & registration service to network with 
other Amstrad users.  Send a $1.00 & SASE for information.  He accepts 
donations, but does not charge for his help.  He has a great 
start-of-the-day disk, which he calls "Bitch" (beginner's introduction to 
cp/m hacking disc) a fully documented disk for beginners or expert, who 
want to do more with their PCW.  He asks for $2 plus a formatted disk
(feel free to send him your goodies on that disk) or $7 without the disk. 
   
For Amstrad software (commercial) write or call New Date, 3651 Woodhead 
Drive, Northbrook, IL 60062 (708/546-9281) & ask them to send you a 
catalog.

Message-ID: <"22-Apr-91  9:42:33 EDT".*.Michael_D._Sprague.wbst311@Xerox.com>

I managed to pick up three S100 Memory cards for less than half the RAM
populating them was worth.  Unfortunately, I didn't get any documentation so I
don't know what the jumpers are for, or how to configure them.  I am hoping
someone can give me a hand with these (like copies of documentation or the like
:-)

The boards are made by Macrotech International Corp. (Copyright on the board is
1983).  The board is labled "MAX-HOST  Rev 1.1".  Over the top of this is a
sticker that says "Z Series".  This is right below a fancy socket which holds
two chips in sort of a piggy-back fashion.  The boards are populated with 3
rows of 18 4164 dynamic RAM chips (150 nS).  Grumble, there are also 7 PAL's on
the board.

One last thing.  There is a socket on the lower left of the board for a
74LS612.  None of the bards have this chip.  Does it need to be installed?

Can anyone help me with these?

I'd be interested what the going price for a Xerox 820 CP/M micro might

sell as a unit (I've been using it as a terminal). Anybody know what the

an 820-II, it is in good shape, and I have no drives for it. Like I said,
I've been using the internal bios term program and the modem to talk to 
the mainframe, but I picked up a Mac finally, so it is of no use to me.

The modem isn't great--it is not autodial, and only 1200 baud, but it works
just fine if you still have fingers to dial a phone with :-) .

Hi, Yes! there is an interface available from AMSTRAD.  Second, a friend of
mone has found a way of freeing the second SIO-Channel on said RS 232 interface
He also wrote a small program called 'BTERM' to support this second channel.
Might come in pretty handy  sometimes.  Whoever is interested, send me a formatt
ed disk (any format is okay, as long as you specify which one) and I'll get it on
to you!

By the way, check out ZMP15 for dialling your nights out and also, ANSI-TERM is
supposed to be it for all AMSTRADs!

Subject: CP/M software
Message-ID: <1991Apr24.052140.21987@noose.ecn.purdue.edu>

I am looking for CP/M software that I could use with my Xerox 820-II with
two 8-inch floppies.  At the top of the list is some type of file transfer
program that will support X-modem and/or Kermit (if it's available)
protocols.  Other desirable items include compilers (Pascal and others) and
other possibly useful programs.  Does anyone have a suggestion or place to
contact?  Cheaper programs are preferred, but I realize that may not be
possible.  Any assistance would be appreciated.

Thank you in advance,

Peter Kurrasch                              email:  kurrasch@ecn.purdue.edu

Message-ID: <1991Apr24.184356.10944@gn.ecn.purdue.edu>

Here is a list of all the cp/m FTP sites that I could find.  This list was 
requested by a couple of people in comp.sys.cbm.  I cross-posted this to 
comp.os.cpm because I thought the people there would like to see this list 
also.  If you have any corrections, additions, comments, or if you would like 
to see this list posted to other newsgroups, either e-mail me or post to 
comp.sys.cbm.  This info was obtained from Archie.

I will post this list every month starting next August, unless, somebody else 
already posts a list of FTP sites on a regular basis, and objects to my
postings. :-)   I probably won't have access to my account over the summer, 
so you won't hear from me after next week until then.

Subject: Looking for a C Compiler
Message-ID: <580@melair.UUCP>

I have recently acquired a Z80 based machine (MicroMate PMC-101) which 
runs CPM Plus 3.0 (Digital). I would like to acquire a C compiler for
the machine (or even a cross compile for DOS). I have heard of a few 
compilers, namely BDS C and Aztec C.

Can anyone direct me to where I can acquire a compiler? An address and
phone number would be appreciated.


I did obtain the SmallC compiler from the Simtel20 archives but was unable
to extract it from the LBR file. I used DELBR11 in DOS and
DELBR12 within CPM. Does anyone know what I am doing wrong here?

Subject: PX-8 problems (batteries?)
Message-ID: <m0jVdOW-00004XC@jartel.info.com>

The usual reason for the PX-8/PF-10 dying, especially after a period of
non-use, is the discharge/death of the *soldered-in* backup nicads. Both
devices have large nicad (or in the PF-10, drycell) batteries, but also
backup nicads of roughly AA size soldered to the motherboards.
 
I've had my PX-8/10 around 6 years, and had to replace both the PX-8 120K
ramdisk backup cell and the PF-10 backup cell about 2 years ago.  That was
with fairly heavy use of the PX-8, but less of the PF-10.  I also replaced
the PX-8 main battery pack, which in retrospect was probably unecessary;
when the ramdisk backup battery failed it dragged the system voltage down
to such an extent that nothing worked, and I thought the main battery had
died - but a new battery showed the same problem.  The PF-10 main battery
pack and the PX-8 backup battery pack are still the originals.
 
I dismantled the cases and soldered the cells in myself with no difficulty.
(On second thoughts, the backup battery on the ramdisk may have had a plug;
but the PF-10's went straight onto the board.  Anyway, you can't buy nicads
with the right plug, so you have to cut and resolder the old one).
 
I find I use the PF-10 very little now because I upload most work from
the PX-8 to a desktop for final editing on a full screen.  I still keep
all the programs on disk, however; I haven't yet reached the stage of
a PX-8 directory on the PC!  But the PX-8 has been incredibly useful in
the time I've had it - really an amazing little beast.  I'm sorry it
never caught on.  The only problem is that the ribbon cable to the
LCD works loose every year or so, and has to be reseated in its connector
just to the right of the screen.  
 
I got the batteries from Snyderscope in the US, around $25 each I seem
to recall.  Last year they had a sale on a lot of PX-8 stuff, including
PF-10s and TF-20s, ramdisk units, and so on.  Their address is:
     Snyderscope International
     1594 Hilltop Drive
     El Cajon
     CA 92020-8227
 
     Tel:  (619) 442-2299
 
However, the batteries are pretty generic (Snyderscope have them made up
locally, not by Epson).  If you took them out and showed them to your
friendly local nicad shop you might save some time and money.
 
Change of subject: if you need a serial port for an Amstrad machine,
try England where they are extremely common and shops (particularly
in London) are willing to handle overseas orders.  Get a copy of the
Amstrad PCW or 8000 Plus magazines, and check the adverts.  I can't
find the address of PCW, but 8000 Plus subscriptions are at:
 
      8000 Plus, The Old Barn, Somerton, Somerset, TA11 7PY. UK.

	Well, I've decided not to go the hard disk route quite yet because
of lack of money. But, I'd like to know what one has to do to change from
8" drives to 5.25" drives on the Xerox 820-II? Could it be as simple as
just rewiring the cables for the correct pinouts on the 5.25" drives? (In
which case I have ready access to a case and power supply that I can move
everything into).
	Or is it a lot more, ie. software changes so that the computer will
correctly access the 5.25" drives?
	And finally, barring any of the above, does anyone have a pair of
5.25" drives for an 820-II that they might consider selling, cheaply?
	Thanks for your help all.

I can sell you the MIX C Compiler for your Z80 based CP/M 
computer or IBM compatible.  It is a full K & R implementation of 
the C language and source is transportable across the 2 OS.  IBM 
version has an optional debugger available.  Price for each is 
$20.00 plus $5.00 for S&H (UPS ground, in the continental US).  
Price for both compilers together, with one manual (it's the same 
for for versions), is $40.00 including S&H (in the US).  Send an 
email address for detailed information.  Take care.

	Greetings.

	I have a Sol20 (as you may remember :-) and have only 1 drive
	(second one is in the mail, or so I hear). Well, with just
	one drive I have been able to format a diskette and then
	SYSGEN it. I have been unable, however, to get either of
	the copy programs that came with the machine to work with
	my setup - PIP and SCOPY.

	Just when I thought all hope was lost, I came up with an idea
	on how to do it. It's quite simple if one has access to the
	DDT utility. (debugger) The procedure is as follows:

	1) run DDT. You will get a message that DDT loaded and a
	version number will appear. The prompt should be a "-".
	2) insert the SOURCE disk and type "Ifilename.ext" - no space
	between the I and the filename. 
	3) Now type "R" - either you get an error message or the
	file loads and gives you "NEXT PC" and on the second line
	the ending address and the starting address, respectively.
	4) insert the DESTINATION disk. (I assume you have CP/M
	on it - for a warm-boot)
	5) press CTRL-C (you should get the A> prompt) if computer
	hangs, you didn't SYSGEN the DESTINATION.
	6) Now, I hope you wrote down the number under the "NEXT"
	header. That's the HEX ending address of the program now
	in memory. 
	7) For you hackers out there, quickly, what's the decimal
	equivalent of that hex number. For those non-hackers, either
	use a HEX-DEC table to a calculator and get that "NEXT" number
	into decimal.
	8) type "SAVE nnn filename.ext". "SAVE" is a built-in CP/M
	command that saves nnn 256-byte pages to disk with the name
	of "filename.ext". This is equivalent to a core dump, for
	those with a UNIX background. Basicly, you are saving an
	image of memory to disk. NOW, the "nnn" is the DECIMAL
	equivalent of the "NEXT" number we just computed and "filename.ext"
	is the filename under which you want the core to be saved.
	9) shut the machine off (to erase all RAM) and boot it. Now, run
	the program (or TYPE it if a TEXT file - yes you can do that
	too :-)
	10) Look at that...


	I assmune noone knows this since it was never suggested - in 
	reply to my 5+ postings ;-)

	Happy hacking.

	Take care.
	
	P.S. Now, for those with a Sol20 without a boot disk (but those
	that have a DiskJockey 2D @ 05000H :-), (no flames - these are
	no longer made and never will be), wanna a boot disk? ;-)

I'm in the same boat.  A friend gave me a Kaypro 4 several days ago,
sans any diskettes.  I have the manuals for the box, plus those for
CP/M 2.0 (addendums to 2.2), CBASIC, S-BASIC, MS BASIC, Kaypro WORD,
and Microplan.

>I'm also looking for applications software.

Me too.  I am not sure of the legalities involved, but I would like to
acquire the software for which I already have the manuals.  I am
familiar with the process of FTP to obtain public domain programs, but
they don't do me much good w/o the o/s to run them.

>No, I don't know what I'm going to do with it yet. 

Me neither.  I also got a quite nice daisy wheel printer (which is
currently being put to use off a spare serial port on my PC/AT)
so I (or my sister) could use it for word processing, and I have a
spare 1200 baud modem that I can plug into the Kaypro's serial port.
I'm sure I can find a PD VT-100 emulator.

It's certainly a curiosity that will remain on the shelf next to my
old Apple ][.

Thanks in advance for all those E-mails I expect to receive!   ;-)

I'm using just such a beastie right now.  It's a Xerox 820-II with 2 disc 
drives (did not come with modem).  It was given to me & that may be some 
indication of it's true value; however, I'm glad to have it to bbs with.  
I understand that it was purchased from someone else for $60 total.  I
have also seen an ad for one for $100.  So, I guess it's true value is 
whatever you can get for it, somewhere in the range between $60 & $100.  
  
You might try posting an ad on Gateway Houston in the wants-ads message 
base.  Gateway Houston has a large videotel audience, because it's a rare 
bbs that can be accessed with a U.S. Videtel videobox.  Many of the 
videobox users would gladly throw away their videoboxes if there were an 
affordable alternative (they cannot bbs anywhere else with the 
videoboxes).  Gateway's phone numbers are:  723-3981, 723-2820, 723-3619 
(it has 5 other lines for videobox access).  
  
But I think someone would to have a disc drive to use it for bbs-ing.

I am still looking for a copy of the Turbo Pascal Toolbox for CP/M
(especially for the B-Tree, and Overlay functions that PICS uses). If
anyone has one, please let me know.

Thanks,

Message-ID: <1991Apr26.135155.4294@vax5.cit.cornell.edu>

	Thanks to all who responded to me about the 5.25" drives for the
820-II. 
	One piece of mail from M. Sprague mentioned that I'll need the
5.25" disk version of CPM 2.2 in order to be able to access the 5.25"
drives (something to do with the CBIOS). Anyone have any ideas where I can
locate a copy of this. I currently have only the 8" disk version and from
the responses I received, it sounds like I can't mix and match the drives
to produce a boot disk on a 5.25" disk from an 8" source.

	Oh as further background, I'm going to be using regular density
5.25" drives. I'll save the hacking of high density drives for later.

Message-ID: <9104261032.AA09412@LL.MIT.EDU>

   There have been several messages about Amstrad PCW computers recently.  A
very good source of commercial support (products for sale for Amstrads in on
those unique Amstrad diskettes) is Elliam Associates.  This is a very nice
company that really tries hard to serve the CP/M community.  Here is the full
information:

I, myself, have a PCW-8512 that I bought for developing and producing the
Z3PLUS version of Z-System.  Because of its large RAM disk (drive M:), the
8512 turns out to be an excellent platform for Z-System.  Some Z-System
programs, such as the ZMATE text editor, will even automatically adapt to the
Amstrad's larger screen size.  Anyone interested in the Z-System for Amstrad
computers (or any other, of course) is invited to contact me.

Subject: BIOS Problems with Zilog Registers
Message-ID: <9104261028.AA09385@LL.MIT.EDU>

   A short while ago there was some heated discussion about problems with
UNCRLZH on an Amstrad computer that may have been the result of failure of
the BIOS to preserve the Z80 alternate and/or index registers.  This is a
suprisingly common problem.  My Televideo 803 has the problem, and so does
the Epson QX10.  We became aware of how many machines were afflicted when we
started selling the ZDOS (ZSDOS and ZDDOS) BDOS replacements, which make
extensive use of the extra registers.  The manifestations of the problem are
often subtle enough that one does not immediately realize that something
drastic is actually going wrong.

   For those running the NZCOM version of Z-System, the fix is quite easy. 
We provide an extended version of the NZCOM virtual BIOS that preserves
whatever registers the BIOS trashes.  Since loading that, my Televideo has
been working just fine.

   I was not aware of the problem with the Amstrad (I have a PCW-8512, though
perhaps it is only the CPC machines that have the problem).  Unfortunately,
the fix there is not so easy.  The Z3PLUS version of Z-System does not have a
virtual BIOS, and the fix would probably require a full RSX, with all its
overhead.  Some experiments with a debugger might reveal exactly which BIOS
calls are trashing the registers, and then perhaps a patch could be squeezed
into the BIOS.

   Did DELBR fail to extract the file, or was the result not usable?  I
suspect that you may have extracted a compressed file and did not know how to
decompress it.  Are you familiar with compressed files, with 'Z', 'Y', or 'Q'
as the middle letter of the file type?  The library extractor EXL will
extract and decompress at the same time.

  Hi all, I'm looking for a couple things (and just to keep you reading,
at the end will be a FREE equipment offer...).
  What I need are boot disks, specifically for a compupro 8/16...I had a line
on this stuff but fell out of touch with the gentleman who was to provide it,
so once again I'm at the mercy of the net.
  Secondly, although it's a bit out of the scope of this newsgroup, I
need a boot disk/a manual/ANY information on...an Alpha Micro 1000E. I
have nothing but the machine, and sage advice that it's a 68000 system.  Any
ideas?
  Next (the shots are getting longer), anybody have equipment to rack-mount
an imsai?  Anybody have an original imsai 8" drive cabinet?  I'll also
make offers on any unwanted S-100 cards out there as I have a couple fairly
sparse card cages here (and a couple packed ones but that's another matter...).
  And now, the free equipment...300 baud S-100 modems, I have 2 with no
documentation to the first...victim...ok, so it was a dirty trick, but you
made it this far, eh?

  Thank you, and good night.

Hi!

I've bought a second hand DEC Rainbow 100 with CP/M & MsDos 2.05
I use that beast as a VT102 terminal (so NO VT100 emulation... :-)

But sometime, when my bigger machine is polling FidoNet (no multitask 
with BNU & Binkley...), I would like to editing something on the Rainbow.

But the problem is the disk format: incompatible with my other machine.

How to set up a link (via serial cable) with my 386 in CP/M (I like RED)?

I remember something about PIP...

Nope, the software will recognize either.

Any old pair of 5.25" 360K double sided drives will do it nicely, but you
might contact Mike Sprague, sprague.wbst311@xerox.com, and see if he has
anything.

Message-ID: <8206EEA94E7F0032C9@ucs.uwplatt.edu>

Hello,
 
I recently purchaged couple Televideo computers: one TS803H with one half
height flopply and one 10 meg hard drive, and one with two half height
floppy drives and no hard drive.
 
The hard drive machines works perfectly, and dual floppy machine
does not.
 
With the pair I did get some manuals: TS803H users manual and the
TeleSolutions word processor/speadsheet/graphics package. And one
boot floopy.  The hard drive was set up to auto-boot and had the
telesolutions software already loaded.  There was also a version
of wordstar on the system configured for it.  The 803HDEMO files
were also on the hard drive as were the utility programs described
in the User Manual.
 
A TS803 manual was not provided, only an 803H manual. Is the TS803
manual much different from the TS803H manual?  Does the TS803 require
a boot floppy different from the 803H? What type of mouse will work in
the mouse port?
 
If you have one of these machines, or hardware information about it,
I would appreciate hearing from you!  There are several upgrades
mentioned in the users manual and demos that sound interesting to me.
I am also interested on the hard drive interface, which is not
discussed at all in the Users Manual.
 
Thanks in advance,

Message-ID: <1991Apr26.095507.1656@cs.ruu.nl>

I'm looking for a good C compiler to compile UZI (the Unix Z80
Implementation).
I'm now using Hisoft's C, but this compiler does not have a
very large global symbol table, so it can't compile the code.

I know UZI was originally compiled with the CodeWorks Q/C compiler,
but I don't know where to get that one.
And then again, this one relies heavily on L80, and as I'm working
with a CP/M compatible system (BTW, with a MS-DOS like COMMAND.COM :-) ),
I do not have this (Maybe someone could also tell me about some
PD linker, or something).
