Subject: Apple CP/M query
Message-ID: <1992Jun27.151106.6361@blkbox>

I am gratified by the response I received from my most recent post.
I have a question for the Apple CP/M community:

Do any of you Apple CP/Mers have an accelerated 65C02 in your Apple?

If you do, does it make a noticible difference in system performance?
This is primarily directed at users of the PCPI AppliCard and SLS
CardZ180 as their OS's run a command processor on the 6502 side that
handles the hardware and passes data back and forth between the CP/M
card and the native Apple side.

My question stems from thoughts of improving screen display speed and/or
serial I/O via the Super Serial Card (or equivalent)  Does the faster
CPU improve matters in these areas?

AdvThanksance.  ;-)

Yes, it's perfectly possible to write a CP/M 3 virus. The important
difference between CP/M 2 and 3 is that you can turn off error reporting
in CP/M 3.

I have written such a virus, but deleted all trace of it except its source
code. The virus would propagate on any Z80 CP/M 3.1 machine, and it would
detect and do nothing on 8080 or CP/M 2 machines. Its code was position
independent, and it tagged on to the end of .COM files (also modified the
first 8 bytes).

The action of the virus was benign -- spread to .COM files on the current
drive, and print a silly message every 10 invocations. Its length was three
sectors (768 bytes).

Sorry, but it's me again, with this ol' TeleVideo.  It's been running just
fine.  Until....

My wife (who uses it regularly) reported that the entire screen flashed bright,
then partially filled with funny characters (looks like renditions of escape
chars, with the small print, multiple letters per char space).  Ever since,
the video display has every other character correct, with the ones in
between all being one ASCII-position off (one bit lower than they should be,
if I recall correctly).

Sounds like a blown chip in the video circuitry to me, but I don't know
the first thing about hardware.  If someone can tell me which chip to replace,
that sort of thing I can handle.  Any ideas?  She's asking daily whether I
posted this and received a reply!  Funny how quickly people shift from "I
don't want to touch it" to "when can I have it back?"

Thanks much.

Subject: Apple II CP/M with an accelerated 65c02
Message-ID: <9207021348.AA26520@tmpcu.mdc.com>

I have one of the 8MHz ZIP chip 65c02 CPUs in my trusty II+ (talk about
breathing new life into the machine 8-) 

Unfortunately, if you are using a Microsoft compatible Z80 board (mine is from
Nexco, now known as Price-Busters I think) you can not take advantage of the
ZIP chip.  Why?  Well, a Microsoft Compatible Z80 board uses DMA to access the
system memory.  Since, it is using DMA, it is changing memory addresses without
updating the tags in the ZIP chip's 8K cache.  So when the 65c02 kicks in to
do I/O operations for the Z80, it is ignorant of many changes to memory.  The
bottom line is that CP/M wont even boot with the acceleration enabled.

I have toyed with the notion of upgrading my graphics package to draw an
entire polyline (multiple line segments) at once on the 6502 side so that I
could pass the data list pointer and length to the 6502, update the cache,
enable acceleration, draw all the line segments in the polyline, disable
acceleration, and pass control back to the Z80.  Currenlty I draw only one
line segment at a time, so  you have the overhead of switching to the 6502
and back to the Z80 each time.  Its not too bad for lines, but making
individual pixel calls is SLOW this way.  But it works!

I wish someone would do a Z80 replacement with on-chip cache memory for
accelerated execution!  The 65c02 one is fantastic to have!

Message-ID: <W8SDZ.12794006341.BABYL@WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL>

If you do not have FTP access to SIMTEL20, files may be ordered by
e-mail from LISTSERV@VM1.NODAK.EDU or LISTSERV@VM.ECS.RPI.EDU.

           If you are on BITNET: LISTSERV@NDSUVM1
                                 LISTSERV@RPIECS

   If your mailer knows domains: listserv@vm1.nodak.edu
				 listserv@vm.ecs.rpi.edu

If your mailer wants bang paths: uunet!vm1.nodak.edu!listserv
				 uunet!vm.ecs.rpi.edu!listserv

If you use bang paths, substitute your nearest neighbor which is also
on the Internet for uunet in the examples above.  Some examples are:
ames, decvax, decwrl, harvard, hplabs, nosc, rutgers, sharkey, sun,
ucbvax, ucsd, udel, uw-beaver, wuarchive.

Send this command to the server to get its help file:

GET PDGET HELP

Sample command (which gets our catalog of CP/M files):

/PDGET MAIL PD:<CPM.FILEDOCS>SIMCPM.ARK UUENCODE

These commands should be sent as the body of a regular email message.
Do not include a signature because it confuses the server.  If you
have xxdecode, you may wish to specify XXENCODE instead of UUENCODE to
avoid character translation problems.

Comments, questions, and suggestions should be directed to the LISTSERV
manager at one of these addresses, depending on which server you normally
use:

                    Internet                  BITNET

  "John Fisher" <FISHER@VM.ECS.RPI.EDU>   <FISHER@RPIECS>
  "Marty Hoag"  <INFO@VM1.NODAK.EDU>      <INFO@NDSUVM1>

Please do NOT send your comment or question about the servers to SIMTEL20.
However, if you wish to report a program bug or to request information
on how to upload files to SIMTEL20, you may send e-mail to me at one
of the addresses below.

The 2797 is the floppy disk controller.  You must have some other hard disk
controller, which is probably not a single chip.

Chris,
 
Its been a real long time since I have written anything for CP/M platforms so I don't feel qualified to give you an answer concerning your first question, but I can tell you that XModem is used with great frequency by CP/M Bulletin Boards.  The protocal is not real effecient, but is quite robust. As for what programming in CP/M comprises of, is really dependent on the language used to program in.  MBasic, an interpreter based language, was real popular when I was involved and came bundled with most of the 






machines. I have seen other high level(ish) languages such as PL/I and Fortran kicked about also.  If you do want to program in Assembly, you should get a hold of the CP/M operating system publications detailing the calls. Like most OS support, you make a call to a vector (aka jump table lingo of some older programing docs).


As for where you might be able to get the documentation, check with Digital Research, they developed and licence CP/M. I don't have their number, some one else might be able to help.  Also check your local computer book store. There are still somes books (albeit out of print) by Osbourne and associates that contain the CALL data and examples.  I'm just unpacking so I don't have the titles at my finger tips, I'll try to find them and post them latter.

Good luck.

I'm looking for some basic information about MP/M (multiuser CP/M).
Can anyone tell me:
    How widely (or not :-) it was used -- any systems still in use?
    Can the user run background processes, one process fork another,
    etc.?  Or, could such extensions reasonably have been added. :-)
    Was there ever an 8086 version?
Thanks.

   >>> information about MP/M (multiuser CP/M).
   >>> how widely it was used

   Not a lot.  My experience was with ICL systems that were originally
   based on the RAIR black box as ICL PCs, then ICL PC2s.  These were
   CP/M 2.2 and/or MP/M 2 based until replaced by 16 bit models running
   CCP/M-86 3.1 and (later) CDOS 4.1 and 5.1.  As they were not IBM PC
   clones (predating the IBM) they were not suitable for later versions
   of CDOS.

   The MP/M models were relatively common as business machines here
   in NZ, much more so in the CCP/M guise.  Altos, CompuPro and Onyx
   also produced MP/M systems.  I still have an ICL and a stack of old
   Onyxs - mostly Oasys, but one or two MP/M 1 systems, in my junk pile.

   I don't know of anyone still actively using their MP/M systems for
   'real' work. This is mainly due to lack of support from the
   manufacturers.  ie cost of maintaining old system is greater than
   replacing with new system.

   >>> Can the user run background processes ?

   Yes.  Ctrl-D brought up another prompt to start up a new process.

   >>> One process fork another ?

   Not fork as in Unix (create a copy of the existing process) but it
   was possible for one program to start another and keep running.

   >>> Was there ever an 8086 version

   Yes there was an MP/M-86 but it was soon replaced by CCP/M-86 and
   then by CDOS, CDOS-386 and is now evolved into DR-MultiUserDOS 5.1.

   I use machines running CDOS 4.1, CDOS 5.1, CDOS-386 and DR-MDOS
   daily (as do my clients) and still develop CP/M-86 (mult-user)
   programs - mostly as portable program that can be compiled for
   MS-DOS, OS/2 and/or Unix as well.

There are quite a few of them.  If you have more time than you
really know what to do with, draw a 'map' (actually several maps)
of the z80 opcodes by class.  Fill it in with the 'documented'
operations and then have a hard look at the blanks.  This is
where the 'undocumented' codes live.  Their relation to the others
give a clue of what they might do.

Subject: undocumented Z80 Ops
Message-ID: <22845@ifi.informatik.uni-stuttgart.de>

As several people have asked me about the undocumented
Z80 Codes I know, here there is a description.
Also I appended a mail of Louis van Dompselaar who
tested them.
I am going to include further undocumented codes
into my Z80 emulator ZSIM (which you can get at
SIMTEL20 (192.88.110.20) in direct. pd1:<msdos.emulators>)

Description of undocumented Z80 Op-Codes (as far as I know them)

The IX,IY registers can be used as 8 bit registers XL,XH,YL,YH
analoguous to H and L. They are coded as the corresponding H/L
operations with 0ddh/0fdh prefix for IX/IY.

e.g.:   8D  ADC A,L     ->     FD 8D  ADC A,LY


This works with all 8080 (that means no Z80 commands with CB or ED
prefix) commands that use the 8 bit register H or L. But note the
restriction, that only one register of the set { H,L,HX,LX,HY,LY } may
appear in the command. E.g.  LD L,LX does not work.
As far as I know  LD {LX,..,LY},immediate8 doesn't work either. (?)

TSTI (C) (Code ED 70) sets the flags corresponding to the value of
         port (C).

SLIA s   (shift left inverted arithmetic) works like SLA but
         bit 0 := 1
         It is coded as  CB 00110rrr  (rrr coded as in SLA).


The fellowing I learned some weeks ago (I found it in the German
magazine mc, 1/1982 page 27) but couldn't test any more as I
have sold my Z80 machine (and is NOT implemented in my 
Z80 emulator ZSIM12 at SIMTEL) 

DD CB ofs XX with XX=10bbbrrr,11bbbrrr [rrr=110 for (HL) is the
documented BIT|SET b,(IX+d) ] works as
CB ofs XX ( RES|SET (ix|y+d)) but afterwards rrr:=(ix|y+d). )
                     ^
                     |
                     The article I got the information had an L here
                     for LX but this seems to be a typing error.

I wonder if XX=01bbbrrr for BIT works too ?


DD CB ofs XX with XX=00cccrrr works as CB ofs XX with a CMD of
{RLCA,...,SRL, and SLIA}, but afterwards rrr:=(IX|Y+d).
With rrr=110 you get the documented CMD (IX|Y+d)
e.g. DD CB ofs 00101110 = SRA (IX+offs).

If you have access to a Zilog Z80 (I don't think that clones understand
the illegals) maybe you could test the codes I could not try.

If you execute DD CB 00 87 with IX=1080 and (0080)=FF and (1080)=0F
there should be FE in A afterwards or 0E if there was no typing error in
the magazine.

Please mail me the results. Thanks.

  As I had some time left, I started working through the undocumented

  Results for the other Z80s (yes, there seems to be yet another

  I figure this performs LD LX,LX, so it actually works, but doesn't
  really do anything

  This one DOES work! This means that LX etc. can be used (almost) as
  any other 8 bit register. However, something like LD (IX+d),LY won't
  work. I haven't tried LD (HL),LX though.

  Can't get this working on the SGS one yet, but no problems on the
  Zilog. Might be a did something wrong in the test routine (the SGS
  chip is in a system which I can only reach by downloading the
  testsoftware to it, and then receiving the results. It is connected
  to a main computer via a parallel (buffered) connection. I made
  this testroutine rather quick, so I might have confused something.

  This one if a rather ordinary 'extra', because it has an opcode
  of its own. Supported by both the Zilog and the SGS.

  IX or IY would indeed be the logical choice, and indeed this is what
  it turns out to be. I have only tested this on the Zilog so far, and
  it works fine with RES and SET.

  >
  You can use the opcodes with BIT, however, it doesn't load the
  result in a register, so it acts just like the documented one.

  >
  They all work. Seeing this, I thought it was a rather logical thing
  to put into the Z80, as the result of a SLA (IX+d) (or whatever) is
  available in the ALU anyway, so putting it in a register might have
  its advantages while it doesn't cost any extra time.

  BTW, here's how I'm gonna try to speed up my system using these 
  opcodes. As mentioned, subsystems are connected to the main by
  means of parallel conections. These have a 1 byte buffer which has
  a 'full' flag. When transmitting large amounts of data, the routine
  would look something like this:

	 LD C,<port>
	 LD B,<2**bit>
	 .
	 .
  LOOP:  IN A,(C)
	 AND  B
	 JR NZ,LOOP
	 IN A,(<inputport>)
         <store data>

  This could now be:

	 LD C,<port>
	 .
	 .
  LOOP:  TSTI (C)
	 JR NZ,LOOP
	 IN A,(<inputport>)
         <store data>

  Provided that the right bit goes into the zero flag, of course. But as 
  these inputlines are still rather flexible, I can make them go there
  (or into the carry flag). Don't know the cycle times for TSTI, but
  it'll be faster than the IN/AND combination. When transmitting 64k of
  data, this saves a lot of AND's (64k, of course :-) ).

  (And I'll have to write my own assembler to handle them, or use defb's.
   Anyway, it's nice to see what disassemblers make of these:

   TSTI (C)  becomes  IN (HL),(C)   a logical 'error'
   LD A,LX   becomes  LD A,L        it just ignores the 0xDD
   A=(SET (IX+d),b) becomes  SET (IX+d),n  again, it ignores the register difference
   SLIA C    becomes  ?????         it can't figure this one out!
   ).

   Anyway, I'll let you know the results for the other Z80s, and the rest
   of the SGS results later.

Message-ID: <1992Jul6.214825.6127@u.washington.edu>

I have (gasp!) an old Amstrad Word Processor that runs CP/M.  I am
wondering if there are any other users out there who have one of these and
has information about purchasing peripherals and software for it.  I sure
loved having this thing when all I needed was a word processor but now it
is just going to continue gathering dust unless I can find some other
software packages (spreadsheet, database, etc.) or find out about the
possibility of hooking up a modem. 

Any leads on sources for software and/or peripherals would be appreciated.
Please respond via email to jcomer@cac.washington.edu. 

Thanks,
Justine

Message-ID: <kasdorf.710469492@honte>

Hi CP/Mers,

  I was recently given an iBEX 7102 CP/M machine and CP/M 2.2 manual but
no ?Boot? (Utility) disk (book says 1 of 1 disk).  The machine appears
to have some sort of bootstrap in ROM as upon startup the screen
displays:

V3.2
*
*
*
*
>


It seems to only allow two digit codes for first four lines (each starts
with a '*') and then the '>' appears and a disk read begins.

The CP/M manual specifies a date of '82 but the machine seems quite 
large for a computer of that vintage.  Made in Japan for NA market,
no date actually stamped on the machine itself, just serial #, etc.

Additional info:  disks believed to be DSDD ~400k.

Thanks in advance to anyone offering any constructive information
or advice.

I'm:  kasdorf@alpha.uleth.ca

Actually an OLDBIE, first introduced to CP/M on a DEC Rainbow (disks
from which are long lost).

I have been installing an Advent hard disk upgrade to my Kaypro 1 and
a couple of questions have come up:

	What is the difference between stock CPM 2.2, 2.2G, and 2.2E?

	When I install NovaDOS, it appears that changing floppy disks
	is not handled properly if the new disk is a different format.
	Is there a simple way to have the BDOS signal the Advent BIOS
	to check the disk format and correct the parameter tables?

	Is there any place where the contents of the Advent BIOS high
	memory is documented? For example, I believe address FFF7 or
	thereabouts, I've forgotten the exact location, points to drive
	tables. If you could point me to an old Dr. Dobbs or Profiles

Any help will be greatly appreciated. Thanks.

I can see why the Zip Chip doing cache and all that doesn't get along
with a Microsoft-type CP/M card -- or maybe any other kind... but is
this true for all combinations ?  A PCPI card has all of its Z-80 RAM
on-board so it won't get hosed, and I think something like an AE
Transwarp doesn't use cache -- or does it -- and so it might be cool.

Anybody tried an AE Transwarp and a PCPI in the same machine ?

My documentation that came with my CardZ180 (PCPI superset)
makes it appear that an accellerated 65c02 of some sort would
be an aid to performance.  Thanks for the feedback (even questions
are nice to see.)  I started the thread in the hopes that someone
had tried it already.  I recall reading about someone who had installed
a 4MHz ZipChip in his PCPI-based CP/M Apple ][+.

All he said is that it worked fine, but that you had better keep it cool.
he never commented on any performance increase.

thanks for the feedback.

It is funny you should ask.  I just brought mine into work today, to work
on it.  I had asked a similar question a few weeks ago, and got the same
response.  Beside the Eliam, I have an address which came with the
machine, saying to write for a free catalog:
SOS Accessory Catalog
PO Box 4200
Northbrook, IL 60065
(312)564-8620

I did not contact the above address recently.  I did contact the other,
and got a catalog touting the very stuff you ask about.
In particular, I was looking for a 2nd disk drive.  Although I hope that
the Eliam (?,  I have neither the catalog or the other message in front
of me) company knows their business, I found a price of $165 or more
to be excessive, since I doubt that the machine itself is worth that
much.

I got several well-meaning responses to my request about drives; I was 
hoping to replace the 3.0-inch with a more conventional 3.5-inch.  Again,
I do not have the responses with me; they are in a notebook at home.  But
I received contradictory messages about what drives could replace what.
I stopped in at a parts store; from their response I am sure that 
convention 5.25 inch IBM drives would not work, because they all have
card-edge fingers (I am told).

FYI, the drive has 2 connectors. The power cable has 4 pins.  The "data"
cable has a double row of 13 pins each = 26 pins.  The Amstrad already
has the B drive connectors in place, so I presume you can just pop the
drive in (maybe needs a dip-switch setting to tell it whether it is
A or B).

To complicate things even further, the main "A" drive pooped out on me.
Even if I were to successfully install a 3.5-inch as "B", I would have
to get the "A" drive going, at least once, to copy the system stuff over
to "B", and then (hopefully) change B to A.

The reason I brought the computer in to work, was that a student here told
me he could figure it out.  After taking it apart, he says that no standard
3.5-inch drive has the correct connectors.  This is contrary to someone here
on News who said that a 3.5 from an XT will work; student says there is no 
difference between XT and others.   Student also spoke of the possibility of
picking up a Rainbow (with hard disk) because he thinks the Amstrad
keyboard will work with it.

This all seems a bit much.  The reason I wanted to improve the Amstrad in
the first place was that one of my daughters has learned it, used it, 
liked it, and could use the Spanish keyboard.  When it broke down, she
used her sister's Brother WP 3400 (gee, I wish their diskettes were
PC-compatible) and liked it well enough.  So I may just junk the Amstrad
[unless you want to sell yours, or your A drive].  Note: I do not
want to be self-serving to talk you out of your machine, but if you want
to seriously expand into spreadsheets and databases etc., you should perhaps 
ask the advice of the net here.  My opinion would probably be that it is
time to go to an IBM compatible.

The connector has the same pinout, it's just physically different. You can
crimp a card edge connector onto the cable beside the header and it will
work.

This is a 'standard' setup. Before the IBM PC came along and did things
incorrectly :-) floppies had a jumper on the drive to select drive
0, 1, 2, or 3. Plus a MX setting. You just select 0 for the first
drive and 1 for the second. The IBM PC used a twist in the cable
between A: and B: to select the drive. Both drives have to be set to
position 1. If the drive cable is flat all the way it will be the
proper way of doing things and you find a jumper on the drive and
set it to whatever is appropriate.

A 3.5 inch drive should plug in. They use the same connectors as the 3.0.
The 3.0 drive used by most Amstrads are single sided, so you will get
smaller capacity than the 3.5 normally offers. The 3.0 let you flip
the disk to use the other side, 3.5 aren't set up for that.

Like many of you, I assume, I have been using Wordstar in non-document

(for CP/M) and love it.  

But I have a problem.  I have accounts on a number of Unix systems

and maybe emacs.  I hate vi and don't know emacs.  Is there an editor
(in C) which works something like Wordstar's non-document mode?

Where can I get it?

(Yes, I said CP/M.  My Ampro Little Board is still my 'main' computer.
I run NZCOM of course, I wrote it, and recommend it. $50.  'call' me.)

Since there seem to be at least a few people out there who have experience
using an Amstrad PCW8256, I was wondering if anyone has ever attempted to
attach a modem to the monitor and use it as just a dumb terminal?  If so,
could you let me know what you did and how I can do it? 

Thank you!

I sent email to Plane to clarify some points, because of still-
confusing info.  Note that in particular, I am talking about the PCW8256
Personal Word Processor, sold on the American market.  In the meantime, 
here is some food for thought.

A lot of this messing around pertains both directly and indirectly to
how much disk space is available, where, in what format.  I.e.,
maybe I would not need a B drive to gain more space, if I had a
communications interface so I could upload some of the stuff from my
A drive to some other machine.  But it is probably fair to say that
few people have modem connections to their Amstrad.

What I am now suggesting is something I would have considered illegal
a few years ago; it may still be impractical now.  That is, that there
be a depository (reachable by telnet) which has the Locomotive and
CP/M binaries; this might enable some of us, by a roundabout series of
downloadings, to get 3.5 disks or 5.25 disks with the correct software
on them, which would be bootable as the A drive.  Obviously the easiest
way is to first get the foreign drive installed as the B drive, and let the
Amstrad itself do the thinking about how to copy correctly from A to
B.  And, I admit, I do not need such support at this instant; I was able
to get my A drive going again by taking things apart, and putting them
back together.  I however do have a program, using CP/M on a DEC Robin,
which reads and writes in many 5.25 formats of different machines, and
I thought that that could possibly be a way of kludging something
together which would be readable by the Amstrad.  Does anyone know what
the numbers are (tracks, sectors, bytes, etc.)?

Message-ID: <75494@ut-emx.uucp>

I have a very odd technical problem I need help with.  I am trying
to write a Turbo Pascal program to write to and read from the modem
port and have discovered that the serial I/O status port does not wait
around with the 'character ready to read' flag until my program can 
get around to polling it, but rather flashes the flag high real quick
and then goes back to idle, in which case my program hangs because it
never sees a 'true' state on the character raedy flag.
 
Is there a BDOS or BIOS call that handles this (the CP/M assembly manual
doesn't list one!) or am I going to have to do funky stuff with device
assignments?  I'd really rather use existing code if I can because if I 
can't, I have to write several interrupt service routines which is
no fun for this camper.

Someone let me know if you've run into this before.  My hardware is a
Kaypro 10 running 2.2F.  Also, while I'm on the line, anyone out there
have Kermit on an 8" floppy (or some way to get it into a machine with
no terminal progs onboard) that will fit a TRS-80 Mod II?

I have a PCW8256 which I used as a terminal in the UK (a VT52 rather than 
a dumb terminal) for several years. It is limited by its clock speed and
the size of the buffer in the serial interface to about 4800 baud.

The UK version had an edge connector sticking out of the back for which
a standard RS232 plug-on module was available. Standard comms programs
such as MEX have overlays to work with it and there is a PCW-specific

Comms programs should be on the CP/M ftp sites, and Amstrad have a presence
on the UK computing forum on CIS (GO UKFORUM).

Definitely illegal. Both Amstrad and Locomotive Software are still trading
so it would be a violation of copyright at the least.

Amstrad still market a PCW in the UK, now with a daisy-wheel printer and
a 3.5" drive. There is a version of LocoScript for PCs and Locomotive make
a cable to fit the UK style expansion slot directly to link to the parallel
port of a PC and transfer files directly.

There are also some small companies in the UK making add-ons for PCWs such
as hard drives, external floppies in most sizes, software to read/write 
other formats etc. Locomotive are a very helpful company you might want 
to contact directly. I don't have their address to hand, but I can dig
it out if anyone requests it.

Brendan, didn't understand that you were looking at swapping out the 3in for a
3.5in.  It can be done, but not easily.  As you noted the connectors are a 
bit different.  With the schematics and a bit of adventure, you could do it --
But I am not sure which controller you would use or how the controller would

the formatting is different from IBMland, and if what I read on this net

BTW, I did check out the 3.5in diskette conversion originally, and opted to buy
the B drive, with the Amstrad floppies instead.

Digital Research hasn't distributed it for years.  I'm pretty sure that
they sold distribution rights to this, as well as to CP/M itself, to a 
small distribution firm in Carmel Valley (Monterey Peninsula) called
Alexander and Lord.  That was about about 8 years ago, so things may have
changed.  My local phone directory lists A&L at (408) 659-2203.

I also may still have a copy on 8" disk.  At least, I believe I still
have the documentation.

68K compatible CPU, very modest memory requirements (I'm sure it would
work in 256K, for example), at least one floppy disk.  I wrote the BDOS
and was project manager for it for DRI when employed there in the early 80's.
I was under pressure to get _something_ out quick, so I wrote it to be as 
similar to CP/M 2.2 as possible (quickest way to produce a product).  
The first system I wrote a BIOS for was for an S100 system that included 
a 68K CPU on an S100 board and a Tarbell floppy disk controller.  It took
me a day to translate the 8080 CBIOS for the Tarbell into 68000 assembly, 
and it worked first time.  So if you're familiar with CP/M, it should be 
fairly easy.

Yes.  Repost and let us know how it turned out.

Interesting factoid:  CP/M-68K was the only version of CP/M written in
a high-level language.  It was written in C.  All other CP/Ms were in
assembly, although the utilities were in PL/M.  We compiled the utilities
for CP/M-68K using a compiler we acquired from Hitachi called "Super PL/H".
Truly a monstrous thing, a 12-pass compiler for PL/M for 68Ks, that took
forever to produce anything.

Assuming you connect the right lines there should be no problem - I have
seen it done before.  The controller would handle the disk in exactly
the same way as it handles a 3" drive - it can't tell the difference.

With a suitable program it is possible to read IBM 720K disks - one such
program has been posted to the net a little while ago (in this group).

BTW, unless the situation wrt 3" disks in the US is greatly different
from New Zealand, then it would be a big win to put a 3.5" drive in
instead of a 3" one.

A couple of points though: the drive won't fit internally (size
problems), and it will probably need it's own power supply (+5 and +12)
although if you have no other bits plugged in you may be okay.

Because they didn't work properly. Eg, the shift instruction puts a 1
into the new gap instead of a 0.  This isn't a major problem if you know
about it, but it is non-standard (compared to the other shift codes).
The extra index register instructions were probably more due to the way
the instructions are decoded than anything else; I think they were
always intended to be index registers (pointers) rather than extra 8 bit
registers - they are slower than the normal 8 bit registers.

>> Is there an editor (in C) which works something like Wordstar's non-document mode? <<

In about 10 days I plan to post my adaptation of mined to the newsgroup comp.editors .
It is not quite a Wordstar clone but it has Wordstar's basic cursor key layout and is 
equally easy and naturally to use. Here is the short overview:


Some notes about mined: Its original version is the editor that comes along 
with Andrew S. Tanenbaum's freely available operating system minix. 
It is small, quick, and easy to use. However, when I found the version one 
of my work-mates had adapted to vt100 terminals for use on Sun machines, 
it was not solid either nor was it flexible enough to meet my needs.

Meanwhile its basic characteristics are:
- type in as you'd imagine, no mode switching, logical positioning, i.e. the 
  text appears where the cursor is, not at some funny other place like in vi
- cursor movement: basic functions available in (Wordmaster-/Wordstar-like) 
  graphic control key layout as well as the keyboards cursor movement keys; 
  use of a "hop key" for fortifying movement commands, thus making it easy 
  to remember twice the amount of basic functions (similar to Wordstar's ^Q)
- two key commands (starting with escape) for the less frequent functions
- fully functioning with all terminals (using termcap/terminfo); also works 
  with curses but that was only built in for a quick port to VMS; curses 
  should not be selected in unix versions for two reasons: the output 
  behaviour seems to be clumsier than with direct terminal control and 
  many unix curses implementations still dare to obstruct the use of 
  8-bit character sets
- fully functioning in windows which may be resized at any time and the 
  editor will react immediately and install a correct screen image; the 
  cursor stays at the point of text where it was
- can be positioned on screen with mouse if terminal sends control sequence
- no accidental quit without save or overwrite of file not read before without 
  prior prompting in any way of exiting/writing
- search functions, replacement functions with or without confirmation dialogue
- suspend command with automatic file saving
- ability to read text from standard input or to write it to standard output
- change working directory / change file name commands
- cut/copy/paste/write-paste-buffer-to-file commands with appending versions 
  and an inter-window paste (actually paste between invocations of mined)
- most significant error messages (as a contrast to usual unix commands)
- start at specified line number possible; view only mode available
- panic handling on external interrupts with attempts to save text
- runs on Unix, VMS, MSDOS

I have moved from my trusty cpm machine to a '486 clone but I
still want to use my cpm machine and have the convenience of
a hard drive. What I want to do is connect the two machines
together using either a parallel or serial cable and use the
PC as a hard drive for my cpm machine. Ideally it would be
controlled form the cpm machine with programmes like 'get'
or 'rdir' to get the relevant info from the PC. It would be
nice for the PC side to run as a TSR but this is not 
important. What WOULD be nice is for somebody to have already
done this or something similar. If this is the case, please
email me on u8515682@uow.edu.au. Since I doubt this, any hints
would be useful. The details follow:

CP/M: MicroBee 128k SBC serial port/hardware port 62k RAM DISK
PC: '486/33 4M RAM DR-Dos 6 120MB HDD 2SP/2PP

I would probably implement the transfers in parallel as programming
the MicroBee to do serial communication is apparently horrific.
I want to do as much in C as possible.

The best way to get funny looks in the States is to try to find those 3"
diskettes, that's why I bought up so many of the things when I was living in
Europe, at a fantastic premium compared to the much more available 3.5s and
5.25s.

Now, let me double check the controller answer.  I assume this also means that
you also will be getting the exact same storage as well, 180K per side on
the low density and 1MB total on the high-density drives.

I have a fair amount of curiosity in this because the person I sold my Amstrad
to is probably going to run out of disks in the not too distant future, and
I'm not sure the low density "A" drive (boot and all-controlling) is going to
hold up...

back above the NZ$12 mark.  (Originally about NZ$20).  Oh, BTW, that's
EACH. I haven't bought any in a long long time (I added a 5.25" drive to

You will get the same storage space. I'm not sure that it makes any
sense to format them to 180K, as there is no such thing as 40 track 3.5"
drive (for other viewers: there is a 40 track 3" drive). Certainly you
can, and someone I know did, get 720K format - with the normal Amstrad
programs. Note: for the 720K format you need only a "normal" 3.5" drive
(ie, 720K format for DOS), rather than the high density (1.44MB for dos)
ones. That may save some money.

You could probably replace the A drive with a 5.25" 360K disk. Of course
that makes it difficult to read 3" disks... :-)  I don't think that the
PCW8000 series had the bios for booting off 720K format disks, whereas
the PCW9000 series do.

Hmm..  I have memories of a game that Dick Smith used to sell to run on their
Cistern-80 - it was probably a Big 5 games and could well have been "Cosmic
Fighter".  It had a ship at the bottom and baddies at the top that flew down.
There were different types of baddie that needed different numbers of shots
to kill.  I think there was a number that appeared next to the baddie when it
was shot saying how many shots it had taken, or maybe how many it needed to be
killed.

Pretty vague, I'm afraid...

Hi All,

	I just bought (from the Net) a Digital Research CP/M board for
my Apple ][+. But the problem is, I don't have a CP/M Boot disk for it.
Could some kind soul contact me and let me know how to get one? I will
pay postage and disk cost.

	By the way, I put the card in slot 2. Is that OK?

I fear that the following answer is not exactly what you want to hear:

When someone converted (text) files for me, I presume he had a cable
running between the two types of machines, and Kermitted them;  then
you are sure that the target machine is really writing the disks in 
the correct format.  I am presuming there is no reason to be dealing
with binary files.

There is a guy in San Diego who takes care of the CP/M system disk archives
for the Dino(saur)SIG, part of the San Diego Computer Society.  I have a 
1.5 year old list of available system disks, and the iBEX isn't among them.
However, that would still be a good place to start looking -- a year and
a half is a long time!  The domain address I have for the archive
maintainer is <donm@pnet07.cts.com>.

Yeah, I remember alot of them.  Scarfman.  Robot Attack.  Outhouse.
Super Nova destroyed my 'P' key.  I eventually soldered leads to my 
keyboard and bought some arcade fire buttons.  

Cosmic Fighter was pretty basic, for Big Five, though.  It was space
invaders/galaxian style game.  I have a friend that may still have
this on <shudder> cassette.

I don't think it was really their intent.  They produced a chip that did
the things they wanted it to do.  The 'undocumented' codes are actually
just by-products of the way the internal decoding is done by the CPU.
Actually, 'unsupported' would be a more accurate term.  Zilog recognized
that some usefull things could be done with those op-codes, but flat
stated that if their manufacturing process changed, or micro-code was
modified, those op-codes may not work any more.  As it turned out, the
Z80 sort of dead-ended development wise, and that never happened.

Help?
  I am the proud new owner of a Xerox 16/8 computer.  I just got it from a
friend who no longer used it but wanted it to go to a good home.  It came
san documentation.
  I have the CP/M system, I think I have CP/M-86 (not sure yet), I don't
have MSDOS (he told me it would run an early version).
  I am looking for any info about the hardware, schematics etc.  I am also
looking for info on video mode programming (escape codes etc.).  I am
familiar with CP/M as I am still running my H-89 with CP/M 2.2 and the
Livingston Logic Labs Bios.  I have a moderate amount of experience with
assembly programming but am not familiar with this new hardware.
  Some questions are;
        Is it Xerox 820 compatible?
        It tells me I have 60K bios, but how much memory is there really?
        How do I access the rest of memory, if there is more than 64K?
        Does anyone know if I can get the 8" single sided diskettes? Where?
        Is it possible to expand the disk storage?  Double sided? 5-1/4"?
        How do I program serial output baud rates, etc.?
  I am still in the process of integrating it into my Den, It has been set up,
but doesn't talk to its printer yet.  It is a Xerox (diablo) daisy wheel
printer.  anyone know about it?  It said, on the plate by the dip switch,
something about having a "Special baud rate"  it also has 300 and 1200.
  Like I said any help and/or documentation will really help.  I've been
a computer repair tech for many years, but it really helps to have an idea
what's under the hood to be able to fix it, (when it breaks) after all,
nothing lasts forever.

Hi CP/Mers,

(This is my second post, the first drew no replies.
 I've included more info this time.)

  I was recently given an iBEX 7102 CP/M machine and CP/M 2.0 manual but
no Boot/Utility disk (book says 1 of 1 disk).  The machine appears
to have some sort of bootstrap in ROM as upon startup the screen
displays:

V3.2
*
*
>


It seems to only allow two digit codes for each line (each starts
with a '*') and sometimes the '>' appears and a disk read begins.

The CP/M manual specifies a date of '82 but the machine seems quite 
large for a computer of that vintage.  Made in Japan for NA market,
no date actually stamped on the machine itself, just serial #, etc.
The iBEX Utilities Handout (a next to useless document) is dated 9/82,
revision 2.0.

There is a U.S. company address inside the manual but the phone numbers
appear to be no longer in order (it's been 10 years, EH!):

	Last week I was given an Osborne Executive (Osborne 1 younger

Subject: Re: Xerox 16/8??
Message-ID: <"20-Jul-92  9:24:48 EDT".*.Michael_D._Sprague.wbst311@Xerox.com>

Get in touch with me (EMail or phone), and I'll see if we can get you some
documentation for your computer.

The Xerox 16/8 is nothing more than a Xerox 820-II with an 8086 single boad
computer (the 16/8 card) plugged into the expansion slot.  Both are
independent, with their own ROM, RAM, etc, but they share the drives and
console.

The system boots up in stnadard CP/M, and by running a few commands, can switch
into concurrent CP/M-80 / CP/M-86 mode.  It also ran vanella MS-DOS (not
PC-DOS), but this (IMOHO) is useless on the 8" drive machine, and is of
questionable value on the 5.25" 16/8 DEM since most MS-DOS programs are written
for PC-DOS.  For that matter, I don't think CP/M-86 is of much use either, due
to the lack of available software.

> I am looking for any info about the hardware, schematics etc.  I am also
> looking for info on video mode programming (escape codes etc.).

Drop me a line.  I'll see about getting you a copy of the documentation.

> Is it Xerox 820 compatible?

Yes, in CP/M mode, but it's somewhat better than the old 820.  The 820-II and
16/8 support double density disks .... something you don't get on the old 820
without a spcial harware upgrade.

> It tells me I have 60K bios, but how much memory is there really?

On the motherboard (containing the Z80), there is 64K of RAM (not BIOS), 60K of
which is available for CP/M.  The 16/8 board usualy contains 128K of RAM, but
would be 256K if it has the RAM expansion board.  This RAM is available to
CP/M-86 and/or MS-DOS.

> Does anyone know if I can get the 8" single sided diskettes?

Check out computer flea markets and the like.  I think I might have some, but I
am not sure.

> Is it possible to expand the disk storage?  Double sided? 5-1/4"?

I am going to answer this for all three of the Xerox machines, since the 16/8
can be used as an 820-II.  Also note that a single sided 8" floppy holds more
data than a double sided 5.25" one.  A double sided 8" floppy on the Xerox
820-II or 16/8 held almost 1 Meg.

The Xerox 820 supported two 8" or 5.25" drives.  Single density, but the disks
could be single of double sided.  (Some with older BIOS supported three drives,
but they were only single sided).   5.25" disks were next to useless due to
limited storage.

The Xerox 820-II supported two 8" or 5.25" drives.  Single or double density
and single or double density.

The 16/8 could support two 8" or two 5.25" disks.  It's not quite as simple as
that though.  CP/M-86 and MS-DOS on the 16/8 would ONLY support the 5.25" DEM
(Disk Expansion module), and would NOT boot on the normal 5.25" drives, though
820-II disks would.  Note that to install the DEM, the Disk controller would be
removed (as there was already a Western Digital Hard/Floppy controller in the
DEM), and a buffer board would be added in the 820's expansion slot.  The 16/8
board was installed in a card cage in the DEM.

There is one pin on the Disk interface (on a non 16/8 DEM machine) that
determines if 8" or 5.25" disks are installed.  If I remember right, it's pin
2, and if grounded, it means that 5.25" disks are installed.  In all cases
(except the early 820's) the Xerox machine ONLY supports two floppies.

Last, while it is not simple, I have converted an 820-II to use 5.25" High
Density disk drives.  As far as the 820-II is concerned, it has 8" drives
installed, and treates them as such.  The tricky part is what to do with Drive
Ready.

> How do I program serial output baud rates, etc.?

There is a program on the Boot disk called CONFIGUR.  It is used to set up the
serial ports, the floppy step rate, keyboard interface (7 or 8 bits) and a few
other things.

> It is a Xerox (diablo) daisy wheel printer.  anyone know about it?
> It said, on the plate by the dip switch, something about having a
> "Special baud rate"  it also has 300 and 1200.

I don't know about a special baud rate, but the 820-II has no trouble with a
printer up to 9600 baud (I have never taken it any further).  Some of the 820's
documentation talks about the printer.

Ok, so it's been a while since I've used CP/M. I have a program
to extract .?q? files. What do you use to extract files with
.?z? extensions? I need this program to run under MS/DOS.

Message-ID: <4969@transfer.stratus.com>

Hello,

This weekend I found a great deal on two computers, and am currently  
looking
for any information or software, so I can start using them.

The first one is:

KAYPRO   ( says KAYPRO II on the keyboard and on the side )
gray "box" with blue stips, and logo
two 5 1/4 disk drives
looks like one parallel port, and one serial.

and also:

OSBOURNE Exectutive

white shock res plactic case, w detachable keyboard.
two 5 1/4 disk drives
one serial I/O port
one serial Printer port
one IEEE port
 
both computers have dates on them for about 1981, and they both are  
"portable"
computers, ie the keyboard attaches to the main console, both have  
two  5 1/4 in
floppies, and the monitor in the main case.

They also both display a screen saying: insert disk in drive A: and  
press return.
( so they work!! )
also if any one knows any specs for each machine that would also be  
most excellent!

I can't wait to toy around with these!!

   To "williams9027@iscsvax.uni.edu" about "converting files":  There are
very nice programs that run on a PC that will read hundreds of CP/M disk
formats.  One of the nicest ones is 22DISK, shareware from Sydex in Oregon
and available on just about all MS-DOS BBS systems.  Whether it will do the
trick depends on what CP/M disk format you are dealing with.

   This technique will copy the data in the files over to the DOS machine as
binary data, i.e., completely unchanged.  What you do with the data then is
a separate problem.  ASCII text is never a problem.  If they are WordStar
files, for example, they can be used with DOS versions of WordStar.  The
same goes for dBaseII files.  Lots of other programs have the ability to
convert data that is in those popular formats.  If the data is for some
strange program, then you will have more trouble and might have to write
your own conversion software.

   If you want to move to a Mac, I'd suggest converting to DOS first.  There
are programs available for the Mac that allow it to read DOS diskettes.

   Matthew Kasdorf was looking for a boot disk for the iBEX 7102.  Don
Maslin of the Dino(saur)SIG in San Diego probably has this boot disk in his
collection.  If not, I have a friend who HAD an iBEX.  It may have been the
7102, and he may still have it.  If Don does not have the disk, let me know
and I will try to track it down.

   On the subject of undocumented Z80 opcodes, Dag Erik Lindberg recently
wrote, "Zilog recognized that some useful things could be done with those
op-codes, but flat stated that if their manufacturing process changed, or
micro-code was modified, those op-codes may not work any more.  As it turned
out, the Z80 sort of dead-ended development wise, and that never happened."

   Not at all!  The Z80 was far from dead-ended.  The Z180 and Z280 chips
have followed it.  Both are Z80-code-compatible.  They are supposed to run
everything written properly for the Z80.  Thus, they are not guaranteed to
run programs that used the undocumented codes (and I don't know if the Z180
or Z280 run those codes or not).

   I once built a computer (actually, it is still running my home electrical
and heating systems) using an Intel 8085, and I made use of its undocumented
opcodes.  Later I had to replace the chip with one from Toshiba, and I had a
sudden sinking feeling that the software would no longer run because I had
used those opcodes.  But it ran fine.  Either Toshiba had licensed the mask
designs or the operation of those codes followed automatically from the
obvious implemention of the documented codes.

Programs ending with .?Z? are compressed using Crunch, a
PD LZW-compressor for CP/M. I don't know of any MS-DOS software
that can handle this format --- it certainly isn't compatible
with any MS-DOS crunchers. There is also an LZH compressor
called CRLZH; files compressed by this program can be recognized
from their .?Y? extension. The best way I can think of to handle
this is to get LT29.COM --- a utility that can decompress
.?Q? .?Z? and .?Y? files and extract files from (NU)LU archives --
and a CP/M emulator for MS-DOS. Both should be available
from any good PD library that still carries CP/M software.

Regrettably, it still is not among them.  Fact is, I never heard of it 'til

SIMTEL20 has a small-C interpreter in pd2:<cpm.c>sci-12.ark

Look, also, at SIGM Vol 224 which is a small-C compiler, etc.

hi,

   yes, I used TRS-80 when I was first introduced to computers and still
have several MEGS of software for the Model 3 - 4 & 4P.....
 I finally got a 4P a little after Radio Shack sold out on them and pretty
much tried every concievable "hack" on it (hardware)..... with the service
manual for it still in tact, I manage to keep the machine running all these
years.....and still running as we speak....
 I  can probably get you a new copy of Cosmic Fighter as such, but don't
know if it really matters as far as copyright is concerned whether the 
software is still considered to be licensed or whether it is considered
public domain....since I could just give you a copy of mine on disk...

   There actually is a DOS uncrunch program; I used to use it.  I'm sure it
can be found on SIMTEL20.  However, I second Peter's advice to get a CP/M
emulator, such as 22NICE, instead and then use CP/M utilities (LT is now up
to LT30 or more) on the DOS machine.  The CP/M utilities for dealing with
CP/M compression methods and LBR archives are far superior to what is
available in MS-DOS, and the emulators work very nicely.

Dear Netters, I keep seeing requests of the form "How do i get "telecom 
program" without a telecom program????

Here's how I did it on my DEC VT180 "Robin", a CP/M machine.

Boot in terminal mode, or use a Y adapter to run a terminal and modem.

connect to the computer that has what you want, in Ascii format.
(I obtained the .hex file that I could link for kermit)

PIP datafile=modem, or pip modem=datafile, i forget which way it goes..

tell the other computer to type/list the data out, with a time delay,
and watch it upload to your cpm machine.

link it, and hope it runs...

I iterated this process several times until I got a runnable program.
I then used this program to upload itself again just to make sure it
was all there, then iterated it again to be *REAL* sure.

Kermit has now been running on my machine for years...

Thanks for the reply, but I did not completely understand it.  I knew, of
course, that the Z180 and Z280 had expanded instruction sets, and I would
have guessed that most if not all of the so-called undocumented Z80 opcodes
would have been used.  The question is, do none, some, or all of the
formerly undocumented codes work on the Z180 and Z280 chips as they do on
the Z80?  If some program authors made use of those undocumented opcodes,
will their programs no longer work properly?

I've set up my old California Systems S100 Z80 CP/M system
as a word processor for a friend.
I want to upgrade the terminal from the ADM3A to a Data General
that seems to have an ANSI mode.

Wordstar version 3.0 doesn't have any ANSI terminal in the install menu.
Does anybody have the patches for an ANSI terminal?
Only as a last resort would I pull out the manuals and
look up the terminal patch points and piece together the
corresponding ANSI sequences.  Since my friend's so far away,
I really wnat it to work on the first shot.

Somewhere I have a program that I wrote in Turbo Pascal to build the ROMs.
I've used it to put things like KERMIT, ZSID, ASM, and even PROLOG in my

The Jay Sage I know has both Z80 and Z180 machines at hand.  My Jay would
be answering these questions instead of posing them.  (Just kidding Jay.)

But the question of whether undocumented (read unsupported) opcodes work
or not is moot.  If you use them on your Z80 machine and they work for
you at 'your house' there is no reasonable assurance that they will work
the same way on a Z80 at 'my house' (though they probably will).  And if
they don't, there is nobody to complain to (except the author of the
'broken' code).  The Z180 began life as a Hitachi 64180 and has nothing
in common architecturally with the Zilog Z80.  If any 'undocumented'
Z80 ops produce the same results on a 180 it would be by accident rather
than plan.  And you wouldn't actually use them in a program would you?

It is academically interesting I guess.  Somebody (not me) ought to 
document the undocumented opcodes for both processors and compare the
results.  Offer all results to the net and/or znode and rcpm systems
and stand back.  There are still a few hackers out there who will test
what you say and confirm or argue against your conclusions.  It might
be fun.  But maybe not important.  You wouldn't use them!

As things turn out, the Hitachi '180 traps all unused opcodes.  Undefined 
opcodes generate an interrupt (non-maskable, of course), set the trap bit
in the ITC register, and vector to  logical address zero (for MP/M and
CP/M systems, this will simply end the program).

Subject: Help with Amstrad 8256 (Interface?)
Message-ID: <3605@blue.cis.pitt.edu.UUCP>

I have a friend who owns an Amstrad 8256 with quite a few text files created 
using LocoScript 2.  She needs to transport these to either a PC or Mac
environment.  I suggested a simple ASCII transfer via modem.  The questions
we need answers to are:

	Do you need a special interface to connect a modem to the 8256.

	If so, where do you get it and what price?

	If not, how is it connected?

There are enough important files involved to make some reasonable expense
justifiable, but we hesitate to start purchasing more hardware without some
reasonable guarantee of success.  Has anyone had any experience in this type
of transfer, either good or bad, and what are your recommendations?

Replies can be posted here or mailed directly to:  szurek@vms.cis.pitt.edu

Thanks for your time and trouble.




	P.S.  if you have an interface for sale, we'd like to hear from you.

I am the proud owner of an Osborne Computer.  Wow!  O.K. so it
has no manuals and no software.  I guess I need CPM.  Will any
CPM work or does it have to be Osborne CPM.  After I have an OS
I need a text editor and a C compiler.  Are these things available
cheap, like Public Domain or something.  I don't want to invest a lot
of money into an obsolete computer.

Does anybody know how to interface to it to control things?

Is it even worth it in the days of cheap IBM's

Subject: PX-8 Rom Generator, 1/3
Message-ID: <1992Jul23.115812.57466@cc.usu.edu>

The following two files are my Epson PX-8 ROM maker, written in TURBO
Pascal. It has two commands, I to initialize a file and C to copy a file
from the CP/M host system's disk into the ROM image. You wind up with a file
called ROM.DAT (or somesuch; it's been a long time since I used it) that is
a binary image of the ROM. I've misplaced my utility for turning that into
an Intel .HEX file, so I'm not posting that one.

Once you've copied a file into the ROM, you can't delete it; if you make
a mistake you have to start over.

It also doesn't handle the special case used by the WordStar ROMs, wherein
a portion of the first KB that does not contain FCBs can contain data. In
other words, you can't upload the WordStar ROMs, patch WordStar, and then
use this program to build it back into a ROM of the same size.

The program also only generates ROMs with 32 FCBs. I don't recall why I
didn't prompt for that; there may be some reason beyond the obvious. At
any rate, I've never built a ROM that needed more than 32 FCBs and 32 FCBs
fills 1KB, which is one of the reasons that it can't rebuild the WordStar
ROM.

Enjoy,

You could try to get a copy of WS that was customized for the DEC Rainbow.
That used Ansi escape sequences and the version was 3.0. We have copies here
but I don't want to do anything illegal!

I'm looking for a CP/M system disk for the Sharp MZ 3500 series.
I still got the EOS and FDOS operating system, but I know that there
is a CP/M 2.2 and a Turbe DOS as well. Probably anyone has such a
system.

Thank you

See if it has VT-100, and try that. It might be close enough to get going.

Jeffrey,
	Try the Vt100 or vt102 terminal types, they should be very close to
an ANSI.  Actually, I think that the ANSI X3.64 (or whatever) definition was
built upon the DEC VT1XX series of control sequences.  Good luck!

In theory I still have this game somewhere (If not on disk then at least on
tape).  

I seem to recall that it was a 'galaxian' type game with waves of ships which
you had to shoot from your ship which moved along the bottom of the screen.
As you progressed through the waves you get to shoot two (more?) bullets at
the same time.

At the end of each level a mother ship appears which you have to dock with
to refuel.

Apart from that the only thing I remember is the great sound (for the day)
and the great playability that was the hallmark of all Big Five games.  

Ahh! Memories!

I would like to note, that the above is generally true for SoftCards and
workalikes.

For PCPI AppliCard (aka StarCard, aka Franklin ACE80 CPU), the OS will
not find the card if it is placed any lower than slot 3.

If it is in a //e an you are using the AUX slot 80-column card then slot
3 is perfectly legal for the placement of the AppliCard.  I have been
using an AppliCard (and now CardZ180) in slot 3 of my //e for 4 years now.

The generally accepted location for CP/M cards is usually slot 4 unless
you ABSOLUTELY must have something else there.  Then you can generally
place it anywhere you wish, paying attention to the note I made above.

Keep on Apple CP/M-in' :-) .

The folks that make Uniform, MicroSolutions, make a CP/M emulator that runs
from the DOS file structure. They also have an 8MHz CP/M coprocessor that
the emulation software knows how to fire up; so you can have CP/M software
run on a fast Z80 instead of interpreted slowly by a 386.

An interesting feature of MicroSolutions' emulator is that you can tell it
that anything ending with a specific extension (I use .CPM) is a CP/M
executable and it will automatically detect it from the command line and
fire it over to the coprocessor. In other words, you can type ZSID at the
DOS command line and get ZSID running.

There was a system called CP/M-86, which in the beginning of PC:s
looked like a viable competitor to MS-DOS, and was supplied with many
vendors of 8088 and 8086 machines as an alternative. Long time ago
I purchased a copy from a surplus sale, and got it to run on my PC/XT
clone, except that it did not seem to understand anything about its hard
disk (too old system version?). Later I got an AT-clone, and there attempts
to boot CP/M-86 just hung up the machine. Not any loss, since I did not have
any interesting software to run on it (CP/M-80 software naturally does not
run on CP/M-86). I don't know if there has been CP/M-86 versions that
do run on AT's, but if there is, such a version might run on your 386sx
system.

I presume CP/M-86 gradually evolved into the MS-DOS-compatible
operating system DR-DOS that Digital Research sells these days
successfully (I wonder whether DR-DOS can run any CP/M-86
software?).

Subject: Re: Help with Amstrad 8256
Message-ID: <9207270959.AA19726@LL.MIT.EDU>

   Joe R Szurek asked about moving LocoScript files from a PCW8256 to a PC. 
I have a PCW8256 and recently performed this task for someone who paid me to
do it.  It is painful but can be done.

   There are two problems.  One is to get information from the PCW's 3"
diskettes onto PC diskettes.  Some people have added 3.5" or 5.25" drives to
their PCWs, and then it is easy (assuming they still have a 3" drive --
which many don't).  I have a serial interface and made the transfers using
telecommunications software and a null-modem cable.  This task can be made
easier by collecting all the files one wants to move in one user area on one
diskette (or as many as are needed to hold the files).  I had to collect
lots of individual files from many user areas, and this added a lot of time
to the task.

   I had contracted to move the files as is.  The person had not even told
me with what applications the files had been created.  As it turned out,
some were LocoScript files and others were dBase files.  Although LocoScript
provides its own operating system and file system, the disks are fully CP/M-
compatible and can be operating on in CP/M mode with a telecomm program. 
The 'groups' correspond to user areas.

   Later, the person realized that he could not use the LocoScript files on
his PC.  I recommended that he purchase LocoScript for the PC, especially
since he was familiar with and liked the program, but he declined.  I am not
sure what he is doing with the files -- probably nothing.

   To satisfy my own curiosity, I worked out the procedure for converting
the LocoScript data into a form usable on a PC.  I soon found that
LocoScript, as I expected, has a menu choice to convert files.  There are
two conversion options.  One simply generates the equivalent ASCII file,
stripping out binary headers and special formatting characters.  The other
essentially prints to disk.  That is, it generates an ASCII file with text
whose appearance approximates the printed page that LocoScript would
produce.  Ideally one would probably perform both conversions before moving
the files over to the PC.  Unfortunately, these conversions have to be
performed manually on each file; there is no *.* option.  To speed things up
(LocoScript is a lovely program, but, like WordStar, not terribly speedy), I
moved the original files to the RAM disk and worked there.

>> Do you need a special interface to connect a modem to the 8256....If so,
>> where do you get it and what price?

   Yes, a special interface card is required.  Elliam Associates may have
them.  If not, you'd have to order them from England.  Unless this is going
to be a continuing need, it would probably not make sense to go this route. 
Better to pay someone to convert a few diskettes.

Subject: RE: Undocumented Z80 Opcodes
Message-ID: <9207271025.AA20373@LL.MIT.EDU>

   Willy recently added, "As things turn out, the Hitachi '180 traps all
unused opcodes."  This will not help, of course, if the undocumented Z80
opcodes are no longer "undefined" in the Z180 or Z280.  They will be
processed according to their new implementation.

   I got a kick out of Joe Wright's comment, "The Jay Sage I know has both
Z80 and Z180 machines at hand.  My Jay would be answering these questions
instead of posing them."  OK, I admit it.  I was being lazy; I could have
looked this stuff up myself.  But it appeared that there were others with a
much more burning interest in the subject.

   I completely agree with Joe's implication that unsupported opcodes and
unsupported programming language features simply should NOT be used.  As far
as my home controller is concerned, here's my excuse.  That machine was
built about 12 or 13 years ago, when 2K EPROMs cost $50 each (and 50 dollars
were a lot more money).  The whole unit only had 1K of EPROM (and 256 bytes
of RAM!).  The poor yield (by today's standards) on 2716 2K EPROMs provided
lots of chips with only 1K working, and Intel sold those as 2758s for much
less money (see footnote below).  So it seemed like a good idea at the time
to save a few bytes by using some of the 8085's undocumented opcodes. 
Actually, in retrospect, it think it was still a bad idea -- it's just not
good practice.  It rarely imposes a significant cost to do things right, but
the cost of doing things wrong can be horrendous.

   Joe added, "It is academically interesting I guess."  I think so, too. 
In particular, I was interested to know how the manufacturers felt about
their undocumented codes and, specifically, the extent to which they felt
that they should carry them over to the new chips, even though they never
officially supported them.

-- Jay Sage

P.S. Several years later I was building some computer hardware at work.  In
an attempt to save the company a little money, I specified 2758 EPROMS
instead of 2716s.  Unfortunately, by then the yield on 2716s was so high
that there were no longer any half-defective 1K units, and 2758s were being
specially made only for back-compatibility.  Being low-volume items, they
commanded a premium price, and the company paid $50 each for them (instead
of the $10 I had written on the purchase requisition) when they could have
gotten 2716s for only about $20.  You gotta watch out for progress!

We are in need of a (Batch) File Transfer Program for a CPM machine.
Does anybody know where one exists and if so, what it is called and
where it is available?  An FTP site would be preferrable, but not
necessary.  Thanks in advance...

Hi fellow netters,

I have an Osborne IB, with the double density drives. It served me
well, mainly doing word processing on it.
As the built in monitor is too small on it, I hooked up a PC monitor to
it. I have heard about the 80 column conversion, and as I had the 
technical manual to the machine, I designed and built a conversion.
It worked all right, except due to the longer lines the display
slowed down, and the screen was flickering, so I converted it back.
Has anyone tryed that? Was it flickering? Would I need another monitor
with a longer persistance phosphor? I take, you would not speed up 
the machine, mainly because of the disk drives.
I had problems with my disk drives. They would fail after about 2 ~ 3
hours of use. Turning the machine off and letting it cool dawn would help.
First I installed a fan, into the back of the machine, where the handle
is. This helped a bit, but every now and then the disk drives still failed.
Finally, I redesigned the floppy interface, with a single chip PLL
data separator and PC disk drives, doing away with the Osborne data
separator board and drives. Unfortunately it does not boot (nothing
works at first). I would need to write short routines to test the
different functions of the floppy controller/drive. And here comes the
catch: I have a later style monitor program in the Osborne, which does
not have the test mode, where you could dawn-load test programs into the 
RAM and run it. I would need to have an older monitor, or the source
listing on a computer to modify it. 
Anyone has any of those?
Any help would be appreciated!

Thanks, Peter

There is (was?) a utility that allowed Kaypro IIs and 4s to read and
write various format disks, including MS-DOS.  The utility was called
Uniform.  Does anyone know if there's anything comparable that allows
IBM PCs to read Kaypro CP/M disks?  That'd be useful for my wife real
soon now.

It strikes me that a marriage of a z800 with the multiprocessor

Subject: Basis 108/Apple II CP/M
Message-ID: <d0tn02Nd1boh01@JUTS.ccc.amdahl.com>

I recently picked up a old system called a Basis 108.  It apparently
is a West-German manufactured Apple II clone with a built in Z80.  
This system will boot AppleDOS and Microsoft Softcard CP/M (CP/M
for the Apple II with a Z80 "softcard".)  

The motherboard in this beast has built in serial/parallel connectors.
However, booting under Microsoft Softcard CP/M does not recognize the
existence of these ports.  I assume that this version of CP/M is looking
for serial/parallel ports in the general Apple card slots (which are empty)
and not wherever in memory the built-in ports are located.  The only
solution I can come up with is to either A) find a Basis-specific CP/M
boot disk or B) to come up with some schematics and try and hack the
Microsoft CP/M that I have.

So, has anyone ever seen or heard of this machine?  Do you have a boot
disk or schematics, or know where I can get them?  Any other general clues?
While this system will run some Apple II software, it seems much more
well suited to running CP/M.

--

Also, I have a real Apple II with a Z80 card that I am planning to use
to run CP/M (this system works fine - serial and parallel ports all 
work.)  Does anyone have any general advice about this type of system?

For people who want to get mess around with CP/M hacking, the AppleII/Z80
combo seems like a very cheap system.  I've seen Apples priced as low
as $25-$50, and Z80 cards as low as $3-$10.

Message-ID: <131786@lll-winken.LLNL.GOV>

Greetings,

I am posting this for another chap here at the lab.  Hope I've found the 
proper forum for this post.

Said chap apparently had a Morrow running CP/M 2.2 and created some files with
a program written in Pearl (his spelling - I assume he doesn't mean Perl).
The Morrow has since died, and he now has several double-sided (360K) floppies
with files which he needs to move over to his Mac.  Is there any way of
capturing these files using another system (perhaps an IBM PC running some
appropriate software can read them)?.  

Any help would be greatly appreciated.  Please email responses as I don't
normally read comp.os.cpm.

Thanks and best regards,
mb

I am currently developing some software, written in C, on two platforms,
IBM PC's and Amstrad PCW's.  At the moment, compilation is carried out
on each of the target machines.  I would like to be able to write solely

another set-up to create code for the PCW (CPM). I can then transfer and
run this code, speeding up the development process.

Therefore, please e-mail me details of any software that would make this
possible, either commercial or public domain.  Also, if available,
include any archive sites carrying such software. 

Thanks,

Check out a program called ZMP.  It can be ftp'd from simtel20.army.mil or
any of it's clones (wuarchive.wustl.edu).  I don't remember which directory
it's stored in, though.  ZMP is a CP/M terminal program with built-in
support for Zmodem file transfers.  Since Zmodem supports batch transfers,
it should suit your needs.  Be aware, however, that you will most likely
need to patch ZMP to run on your particular CP/M machine.  Fortunately,
there are ready to be applied patches and instructions for most CP/M systems
available along with the generic ZMP program.

P.S.- I've got a copy of ZMP already configured for the DEC Rainbow if that
will help you.

You want the shareware program 22DISK, which can be found at SIMTEL
mirrors as "msdos/dskutl/22dsk138.zip".  PC hardware cannot read old
single-density Osborne disks, but it can read double densities.
22DISK knows about an enormous number of diskette formats.

There are also several emulators, if you need to temporarily execute
Z80 programs on your PC.

(Is there a FAQ for this newsgroup?)

Ah... Frogger... This brings to mind the most unusual Model 3 disk I ever ran 
across....

During the 1987-1988 "Great Purge" at Radio Shack (this was when ALL model
I/III/4 stuff was DRASTICALLY discouted, I picked up six copies of Zaxxon, two
copies of Frogger, and a mysterious "Master Bootstrap Zaxxon" disk.  Egads! 
This disk was the create disk for Zaxxon!!!  Run the programs of this disk, and
it would format and write either a tape or a disk of the fiendishly copy-
protected Zaxxon image.  Zaxxon was neat in that it used a mixed density disk
format; ie, track 0 of the disk was recorded TWICE, once in single density
for model I boot, and once in double-density, for model III boot.  The rest
of the disk was recorded in single density (for model I compatibility), but
with recorded track numbers that didn't match actual track numbers, and with
a couple of weak sectors, along with mixed sector sizes.  This disk I found,
and bought for 99 US cents, had several programs on it to do this wierd
format, and various other tasks.

However, even with the level of protection that it had, it was cracked, and
several versions of it are floating around....  Plus, it IS more convenient
to simply type "zaxxon" at the command line, instead of having to boot the
system.

I would agree with that too.  Pretty funny that Tandy (king of telling

codes in Model III TRSDOS.  When the Z180 speed up board came out for the
Mod. 4, this became readily apparant.

Message-ID: <920729201053.20c026d2@CC.SNOW.EDU>

I purchased an EPSON PX-8 (geneva) quite a while back.   It was an extremely
reliable machine except for an occasional ramdisk crash.

About a year ago, the unthinkable happened...  The UTIL rom (with PIP, and
all the good utilities) died.  What I was wondering is if there is anyone out 
there with a UTIL rom and an eprom burner which would be willing to read the
contents of this rom into a file and send it to me (preferrably
electronically)?   I have an eprom burner at my home that I can use to program
a new prom, but it's kinda hard without the contents of the rom.

Also, anyone know of any good software for a PX-8 available on SIMTEL or
another FTP site?  Any other technical PX-8 information would be wonderful.  

And finally, I have an old ICC GOULD industrial computer which runs CP/M. 
Unfortunately, the manufacturers of this computer decided not to use a standard
disk type.  Anyone know what parameters I could stick into a CPM disk emulation
program such as 22nice or the like to use this?   Anyone got any ideas about
what the I/O ports would be on this thing?

Thanks for any assistance,

I am trying to fish some text files off 5 1/4 inch CPM disks in order to
put them on an msdos machine. Unfortunately, the CPM machine is a
specially obscure one: an ancient ICL PC which I believe was a Rair
Black Box in disguise. I have various programs which do this kind of

know if the format used by Rairs corresponds to that on a less obscure
machine?

I can tell from the disks that they are DS/DD 48 tpi soft sectored, but
even then that leaves an awful lot of possibles. If anybody has any
clues, please email them to me.

   >>> I believe that CP/M-86 evolved into the MS-DOS compatible DR-DOS

   CP?M-86 went many ways.  CP/M-86 for IBM-PC (pre-XT) was released
   about March 82, it was upgraded mid-83 to support XT with hard
   discs.  Early MS-DOS also did not support hard drives.  It was
   replaced as a product by Concurrent-CP/M-86 in mid 83.  This allowed
   multi-tasking by having 4 'virtual screens' thus 4 tasks could run
   simultaneously.

   CCP/M developed to include the ability to run MS-DOS programs as
   Concurrent-PC-DOS (3.2) in Sept 84.  This system was also multi-user
   (as well as multi-tasking) allowing terminals to be attached to a
   multi-port card.

   It has developed through CDOS, CDOS-386, to now being DR-MultiUser-DOS
   5.1.  DR-MDOS still retains CP/M-86 and MP/M-86 compatability in
   its 'native mode' API.

   DR-DOS was originally built from the CDOS source code by removing the
   multi-user, multi-tasking and CP/M-86 compatability parts to produce
   DR-DOS 3.41.  I understand that DR-DOS 6.0 and DR-MDOS 5.1 still have
   some common source code.

   There were other DR 'replacements' for CP/M-86.  DOS+ in the mid-80s
   was a MS-DOS 2.x clone that also ran CP/M-86 programs and had limited
   multi-tasking abilities.  It was bundled with Amstrad 1512 and 1640
   machines - though MS-DOS was also included.  It also came with the
   ACORN 80188 co-processor for the BBC Master 128/512 (for students of
   the esoteric the BBC Master 128 was a 6502 based 128Kbyte machine,
   the co-pro was just a 80188, 512Kb of memory, couple of ROMs that
   plugged into the 'tube' to give MS-DOS compatability - I still have
   one).

When the IBM PC first came out, CP/M-86 had, in theory, equal status with
PC-DOS.  It was licensed by IBM, and available on PC's as an IBM product.
However, Bill Gates managed to make a deal with IBM that resulted in the
retail price of DOS being about 1/4 of the retail price of CP/M-86.  As you
can imagine, very few copies of CP/M-86 were sold this way.  Digital Research
made an attempt to retail CP/M-86 through distribution channels at a competitive
price, but by then the market had decided that PC's were DOS machines.  The
rest is history.

Well, yes and no.  In the beginning, there was CP/M.  CP/M begat CP/M-86
and MP/M.  MP/M and CP/M-86 begat MP/M-86.  MP/M-86 begat Concurrent CP/M-86.
Concurrent CP/M-86 begat Concurrent DOS.  All of this was done at the main
offices in Monterey.

Engineering of the Concurrent DOS product was then moved to the U.K. development
office outside London.  They enhanced this product for several years.
Eventually, they developed enough expertise in the internal workings of DOS
that they decided that they could successfully clone DOS.  This they did,
and called it DR-DOS.  It was not a deriviative of CDOS or CP/M-86, tho.

Concurrent CP/M-86 and some versions of Concurrent DOS could.  DR-DOS can't.

The Z800 didn't ever show up (at least to customers). However
the Z280 really close to the Z800 tech. manual. I didn't do 
a real thorough comparison, but from a first look the Z280 is
only missing a timer. It also comes in a single pinout, as
compared to 4 different versions of the Z800. It inputs to
select 8/16-bit bus and Z-BUS mode.

However my Z280 didn't work as described in the manual. I 
could quite easily lock the chip (for example by enabling
DATA/INST-mixed cache).
Don't know about the current revision, mine was an eng. sample.

There is no real multiprocessor-support (at least I'm not aware
of it). That is, you're on your own to maintain cache coherence,
no bus-snooping).

The chip seemed to be quite slow (but this may have been fixed, too).
Even the data-sheet claimed a cache HIT to take about 5 cycles !!

A nice feature: It has builtin EPU-support. I think, this was meant
for devices like the Z8070-FPU (which didn't show up either), but
the protocol is quite close to the 32000-protocol and you can
attach 32081-FPU w/ some HW-support. This is a cheap yet reasonable
fast way to get floating point.
