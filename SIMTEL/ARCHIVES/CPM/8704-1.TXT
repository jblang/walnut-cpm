well folks, some of us poor people in this world are still faced with
the problem of floppies with only 180 + or - KB. To enhance the problem, I 
work on systems where disk space is measured in 3 digit MB or GB. In essence
I am spoiled. I am quite happy with my world of CPM and not the least bit
intrested in MSDOS.(Yechhhha!!) (There, that should tick off a few people.)
If i buy a new machine it will be a multi user unix system. Since rome wasn't
built in a day, and neither was my bank account, that is a future option.

Meanwhile, I want more disk space. Simple enough. Next problem, I ain't the
time to design my own HD system, so if anyone in the wild blue yonder has
done anything or knows anything about HDs for the before mentioned machines
(OB 1 or Kaypro 2) please send me the information. Thanks in advance.

Have you tried RUN CP/M by Micro Interfaces Corp., or Media Master
Plus from intersecting concepts?  The only problem with either program
is that you cannot run Z-80 code, and that you need to replace your
8088 with a V-20.  Within those limitations, you should be able
to get by.

The Z80MU CP/M 2.2 emulator on a PC is available from SIMTEL20

The convention used in the pc-blue archives is that files with version

The program Z80MU seems to work well for the limited cases I have tried.

It's hard to believe, but with V20-80, you can run modem programs,
written for cpm under MS-DOS.

One of my recent problems, is that I bought a USR S100 MODEM.  Not
only does it no work very well with USR 2400 MODEMS, but I have had a
heck of a time finding an acceptable modem program (under MS-DOS) that
could be configured for an S100 MODEM address.

PRODRIVER, is not too bad, but it is strickly menue driven, and does
not forgive more than ten errors in a file XFER, even if the file is
B I G!

Well I'm using MDM730, which was easy to reconfigur under CPM, on
MSDOS by using V20-80.COM available at SIMTEL20 under
PD:<CPM.EMULATORS>V20-80.COM...............  THANKS Keith and Frank

 for the disktypes I want to read, but although I can think of a good, effectiveway to make such a program, I don't understand how bitmaps and the DPB math workwell enough to write it myself. Any ideas? I will summarize to the net as it

   820INIT is just a little example program.  It initializes a

   little use on a PC or clone, other than for trying out your
   favorite editor/assembler/linker.  I have used Z80MU on a
   clone, and had good luck with it.  Things like USQ, DELBR,
   LU310 all seem to work well.  The only change I notice is
   that it is ***SLOW***.  I'm glad to see that it is available
   on SIMTEL20.  It is a very nice piece of pd software.

I am looking for the software which drives the clock/calendar,

Subject: ANchor Volks 6480 modem

Does anyone out there have a modem overlay for MEX, IMP or MODEM7
to allow use of a Anchor Automation Volksmodem 6480?  It's not
Hayes- or anything else-compatable.

I got it partially working with MEX using the C128 overlays as samples
and borrowing sections of code (timing, etc).  It "almost" works in
terminal mode but gets lots of data errors, primarily character swaps
not garbled characters.  It looks like the first character of a line
will show up later in the text.  I know its something I'm doing wrong,
but haven't figured out what yet.

By the way, this is the modem you get if you order the 300/1200 baud
modem for a C64/C128 for $79 from Protecto. Programming info is non-
existent with the modem, but Anchor will send you some cryptic 
photocopied sheets which consist mainly of a assembly language
listing of a dialer routine. It has almost no comments and uses
very descriptive labels such as "d", "g", etc.

If you are thinking of getting a 1200 baud modem for your C128, stick
to the 1670. I have seen them advertized in the mags for as low as $99.
The extra $20 is well spent

I have no association with Anchor or Protecto except as a not-very-satisfied
customer.

The Media Master Plus product referred to by Ari Davidow in his note
from the 1st does NOT require a V-20.  If the V-20 is not there, it does
software emulation of the 8080 and Z-80 instruction set, at speeds that
might best be described as 'slowly' and 'very slowly'.  But you would
need the V-20 only if you need performance as well as the ability to
occasionally run the programs.

I need advice/recommendations on data communications programs for an
Osborne-1.

Requirements are:

     Runs on Osborne-1 (Tan case, DD, 52/80/104, 360K Drive-C)
     300/1200 bps
     Hayes compatible
     Uses RS-232 port (not the modem port)
     Terminal emulation
     Data capture capability
     XMODEM protocol capability

Preferred additional features:

     Kermit protocol
     Auto-dial/re-dial

Ideal but not necessary:

     VT-100 emulation
     2400 bps capability
     Split screen for incoming/outgoing data
     Osborne CommPac modem compatibility

I'm particularly interested in public domain programs or those under $50.
More expensive may be ok if it's really super-duper, all singing, all
dancing, etc., etc.

Replies to me will be summarized to the net.

Gee sounds great, I presume it's an S-100 card, or does it use the Z-80
bus?  I didn't think there were S-100 cards from Taiwan, but who knows..

Sorry, I don't remember the specific programs I tried.  Just downloaded a few
at random to see if it really worked.  One that I tried that didn't work
was the CHEF program in the pd:<cpm.database> directory.  A friend wanted
a recipe program for his PC to convince his wife how useful this thing
he was spending so much money (and time) was.  I have since noticed that
there has been an update to CHEF so I don't know if it was a Z80MU problem
or a CHEF problem.

If I get around to tryingh it again, I will try to do a more controlled test
and let you know.

Well I think the subject line says most of it but anyway...

Does anyone know where I can get a GOOD compiler (not something like the
Small C compiler which I have and don't like). This should run under CP/M 3.0+
on a Commodore 128. I would also prefer that it compiled to the extended Z80
mnemonics but that's not THAT important. I also would prefer that it did NOT
work like Small C. ie. c program -> assembler program -> .REL files -> link'em.
That is a pain in the *ss. (and I don't even have an assembler which can
assemble .MAC files in the format that Small C produces so Small C is useless
to me).

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Sorry, I left out one small detail that I didn't find out until the
next day - ZPC must have been installed.  It is not necessary, or
benificial to be in the PC mode, but unless ZPC has been installed,
V20-80 will hang the system with the infamous "WILD INTERRUPT.

Other CPM programs that seem to work are: MDM740, MEX, BiShow,
NewSweep, NULU11, SuperDirectory, and setids.  My versions of
Modem730, MDM740 and MEX have been patched for an S100 Modem at '30H'.

QuicKey of course doesn't work - only an eternal optimist would even try!

I know they're coming out with Turbo C for the IBM, but I'm not sure if there
will be a CP/M version. I'd certainly like that. It's supposed to be fully
K&R compatible. I worked with Turbo Pascal a lot and if Turbo C is anything
like it, it should be a must have. Does anyone know anything about Turbo C
for the CP/M OS?

I doubt that such is possible. The multiformat programs must
talk to the disk controller on a intimate, low down,
hardware level in order to function. Since the CP/M machines
(and many others-to be fair) had differing hardware, in
various locations.....
But good luck anyhow!

Nearly all C compilers work the way you described (compile, assemble,
link, run).  It can be a pain at times, but it has it's advantages.
Small C has it's own assembler and linker - at least, mine does. It's
for vanilla CP/M, so it should work on your machine. I usually use
Manx/Aztec C V1.06, which is pretty complete and powerful.  If you
want fact, use the famous BDS C. It's to C what Turbo is to Pascal. Be
aware that is uses non-standard file I/O.

I'd suggest contacting MANX Software Systems for their Aztec C compiler for
the C128.  I know many of people using their Amiga version, and they like it
quite a bit.  All of the larger machine versions come with linkers, so I'd
expect to find a linker and everything else you need with the C128 version.
As I recall, the C128 version runs in CP/M mode, but will actually produce
compiled code for CP/M, C128, or C64 modes.  Your best bet would be to call
them: the numbers I have are (800)221-0440, or (201)542-2121 and they can
probably answer all you questions.  Amiga versions of the compiler go from
$199 to $499 depending on the utilities, etc. and the version of the 
compiler you get.  I'd expect the C128 versions to be in the same ballpark.

(DISCLAIMER: I've got no ties to MANX, they won't even send me kickbacks)

[munch munch munch...]

	The Small-C compiler should come with the necssary programs
to fully compile and link your creations. I have the complete package
which produces Z80 code but alas contains minimal docs on the assembler
Zmac and the linker Zlink. Although Small-C is definately a small subset
of C, I find the libraries and doc files excellent for the price, $10.
	If the programs for Zmac and Zlink are needed, I will upload
them to whoever knows how to put them in the SIMTEL libraries, 
assuming they are not there already. (Still trying to figure out how
to un-uuencode)

To any CPM'r who may know the answer or at least have a theory:

A .MAC file on a 5.25" floppy was inadvertently deleted and needed to be
restored.  No writes to the disk were made after the deletion.  I used
RECOVER.COM to recover the file.  RECOVER.COM stated that the file was
recovered, but when back at the A>, I did a DIR and the file was not
listed.  STAT or PIP could not find it either.

I used DU-V87 to examine the directory entry.  The first byte was in
fact 00 and none of the high bits of the file name or ext were set.

A real puzzel.  Any answers or ideas?

  One option is to use a SASI host adapter that piggybacks into a Z80
socket (i.e., the Z80 is pulled out, the daugther board is plugged
in, and then the Z80 is plugged into the daughter board). Xebec (the
hard drive controller people) have such an interface detailed in their
manual for the S1410 hard drive controller. All you would need would be
the host adapter board mentioned above, a copy of the BIOS so that you can 
add the mods so that CP/M can recognize your hard drives (you do have a

Xebec S1410, Adaptec-4000... a shugart surplus lookalike is available in the 
$80 range), a power supply for controller and drive(s) (PC-type supply, 
perhaps) and appropriate signal cables.
  Another option is get one of the hard drive adapters sold by some of the
advertisers in Micro Cornucopia (Emerald Microware?). These are pricy for

There is a new version of NCRC (10) in PD:<MISC.TOPS-20>.  This
version has two new switches: /FORCE and /WRITE.

The /WRITE switch (which implies /FORCE) causes the computed CRC value
to be stored in the .FBUSW of the FDB.  Of course, the user must have
write access to the file for this switch to have effect.

The /FORCE switch will cause NCRC to compute the value for the file.
If the value of that word is non-zero, NCRC will skip the computation
and display the value found in the .FBUSW word.

All publically readable files on our PD: structure now have that word
set with the computed CRC value for that file.  If you FTP any of
these files directly to another TOPS-20 system, and your FTP program
provides the option to retain all FDB information, be sure to turn
that option on.

The primary motivation for adding this feature was to decrease the
amount of time the Archive Server spends processing requests for files
which include a CRC listing.  In the past few hours this feature has
been available, the performance improvement has been rather dramatic.
It may, once again, be possible to start seeing a much improved
response time instead of the 5-7-day turnaround of the past few weeks.

Subject: Re: Tandy Model 4 & CP/M 2.2

The Tandy Model 4 runs an excellent, totally compatible version of
CP/M 2.2 from a company called Monezeuma Micro.  The specifications
are as follows: TPA on 64k system 56,070 bytes; 55046 bytes with
a hard disk driver installed.  CP/M IOBYTE: fully implemented.
Device drivers: 35, 40, 77 & 80 track, single/double density,
single/double sided, 3.5, 5.25, or 8 inch, more than 85 formats
supported.  Maximum disk capacity: 40TK SSDD = 220k; 40TK DSDD = 440k;
80TK DSDD = 880k.  RS-232: All word lenghts, parity & baud rates.
Parallel Printer: With/without line and/or form feeds. Video: 24x80
with reverse video.  Keyboard: full ASCII with 9 function keys.
RAM disk: 64k, *AUTOMATIC* on 128k systems.

Montezeuma Micro's numbers are (214)-631-7900 for information,
(800)-527-0347 for ORDERS ONLY.  If you want more info, pick up
any issue of 80 Micro magazine.

Note that the Model 4 comes with an excellent OS called TRSDOS 6.
There is a lot of excellent software available, and even if CP/M is
your primary interest, don't ignore this capacity of the machine.
Pro-MRAS is *the* best Z-80 assembler I've seen, and with a utility
like HyperCross, you could develop CP/M software under TRSDOS, if
you wanted to.  If you want more info, don't hesitate to ask me
directly.

CP/M but generates either Z-80 code (for CP/M) or 6502 code (for C128/C64)
[Aztec C65-c/128 C64, C128, CP/M $399].  Manx usually takes out two ads in

Message-ID:  <8704141109.aa14715@SMOKE.BRL.ARPA>

	If anyone owning a gs is thinking about purchasing a z80+ from Applied
Engineering, I would recommend waiting.

	I purchased a z80+ a week ago that had a little "runs on GS" sticker
on the front of the box.  When I tried to install the operating system con-
figuring it to use a 3.5 Unidisk as the boot device, it would not run.  The 
user's manuals contained no instructions which assist GS owners in installing
CP/M.  After a little fiddling, I discovered that you had to set the system
speed to normal through the control panel before the operating system would
boot from a 3.5 through the smart port.

	The resident system commands seemed to work ok after it booted but
I could not get programs to load from disk.  A call to Applied Engineering
revealed that they have a new revision to the operating system ( 5.2?) 
which is supposed to correct the problems with the z80+ on the GS.  They
still didn't indicate that they had any plans to revise the operators manuals.
(there were no addendums in the box either).

	I'll keep you posted if you'll keep me posted.

Subject: deleted file?

  The only thing I can think of is that if there is a directory entry ahead of 
the one for you file, which contains all E5's, the standard software will think it marks the end of the directory and ignore the rest. You could modify the name field of such an entry (put in 20's or such) to override that. I would strongly suggest making
 an IMAGE copy of the disk before doing much of that stuff (NOT
a PIP copy). Another thing you could try would be the SAP program (PD), which
does a sort-and-pack on the directory. Definitely have a backup before you do
that. Probably the best solution would be to enlist the help of someone who is
experienced with DU. Good luck. Oh, by the way... where was your backup copy?

Unix commands sb and rb which came from simtel20 in
pd:<unix.communication>x-ymodem.shar.1

MEX and sb/rb can't seem to agree on the exchange of file names. When
send/receiving a single file, they seem to work ok in crc/checksum
and 128/1024 combinations.  The unix version is 4.3BSD on a Vax 750.
rb and sb were compiled with cc -O -DV7 xx.c -o xx as per the
comments in the files for unix v7, 2.8 and 4.x.

Any descriprion of the file name exchange expected by MEX or
pointers to docs for it or y-modem (yam?) protocols would be

  It was my impression that a CP/M is a CP/M is a CP/M. Was I wrong? If Aztec
C is available for CP/M, is therefore available for Commodore machines running
CP/M. If this is not so, why? BTW, I am somewhat knowledgable (not expert) on
CP/M BIOS structures. I don't believe in There Are Mysteries :-).

   I feel there are no differences except for the display
 codes for the monitor.  I have been running CP/M on the 128
 for about a year and have found no problems with running
 KAYPRO IV  CP/M 2.2 stuff.  New Word needed some help, but
 not much!!


   As for C, I have been using the BDS C compiler for several
 months with no problems.  I have seen AZTEC C run on another
 CP/M machine and I feel that the BDS C compiler is much better.
 There was a review of several CP/M compilers in a 1984 BYTE.
 If anyone is interested, I could come up with the exact issue.

Sounds like MEX is looking for the old MODEM7 batch hack, not YMODEM batch.
Funny, because I thought MEX was supposed to support YMODEM, but apparently
it doesn't.  If it did support YMODEM, it would work properly with the
Unix rb/sb programs assuming something isn't broken with you particular
Unix system.

You might wish to check the Unix commands with a known correct YMODEM
program such as YAM, Pro-YAM, or the shareware ZCOMM.

Turbo Modula-2 from Echelon has been a good choice. I have used Turbo

a few weeks experience. I am using a KAYPRO-10 and have had no problems
at all (yet). 
 
There has been reviews in Micro Cornucopia (end of 1986, begin of 1987 ?).

Hi people,

after its execution my screen will be cleared.
But when this program for example displayed
a message or something else I can't read it anymore. So is there anybody

Ralf, I don't think this is a CP/M problem.  I have used 60K Microsoft CP/M
2.23 on an oldstyle SoftCard in both a ][+ and a //e, and 64K PCPI CP/M 2.2 on
an Applicard, and I don't get this screen clearing that you describe.  Certain
programs from certain vendors may do it, but the following programs I've used 
don't, at least on my system:

	WordStar
	DataStar
	ReportStar
	MicroCalc
	Strunk & White
	Turbo Pascal
	Microsoft F80/M80/L80
	All the standard CP/M tools

Sorry I can't be more informative in a positive way, but I hope this will help
point you in the right direction.  Good luck in finding an answer.

A bug report on DELBR11 from GEnie's CP/M RoundTable:

----------
Caegory 3,  Topic 4
Message 15        Thu Apr 16, 1987
B.DUERR [Bill]               at 15:42 EDT

     DELBR is a utility program that may be used to extract all
ember files from a "Novesielski" library (.LBR).  The program is
written in C and has been compiled for CP/M-80, CP/M-86, and MS-DOS.
 
     When using this program, caution must be exercised.
 
     The program will extract up to 64 members.  If the library
contains more than 64 members, it will terminate--there is no error
message displayed.  The program does not verify the CRC integrity
when extracting the member files.  The program will write over
existing files with no warning message displayed.

     The C source statements are available in the CP/M Software
Library, see file 806, DELBR11A.CQ.  We welcome anyone with a
knowledge of the C language to update this program, especially in
the area of error checking.  Even though there are other programs
available that provide the functions of DELBR, this program provides
a portability across many operating systems.

     Several people write:

Howcum MEX doesn't support YMODEM batch?

     The answer is:  it does.

     The .DOC file MEX10.DOC doesn't tell you how to do it, basically 'cause
MEX 1.0 didn't know how.  What you use is the 'K' option.  MEX will not
default to YMODEM, like IMP will.

     Try a command line of the form: 'SKB <filespec>'.

Yet the unix program I use 'xmodem' supports Modem7 batch protocals and I
still can't get Mex to accept it.  I did download and assemble Imp once
(yech!) and then Mex worked and so I removed Imp.  Immediately Mex stopped
working.  Maybe it's load dependent, but I'm lost...

rb and sb only implement YMODEM batch whereas MODEM7, MDM and MEX 1 only
implement MODEM7 batch protocol.  YMODEM batch is technically superior to
MODEM7 batch; but that doesn't help you much.  My UNIX xmodem program
(posted to Usenet's mod.sources in January) supports both MODEM7 and YMODEM 
batch (among other things...).  Unfortunately, as distributed, xmodem runs
only on 4.2/4.3BSD systems but two people have sent me patches for System V
systems which I might be persuaded to integrate into a second release.

C. It's no longer available, to my knowledge, comercially.

If you've  got the old Amethyst package (Mince + Scribe-like text processor,
Scribble), that'd be even better, but it's not a requirement.

Any help'd be greatly appreciated....

Subject: Re:  Deleted file ?

Sounds like to me you "undeleted" an extension, rather tha the
root file.  Any file over 16k creates extensions, one for every 16k
of file.  They ALL must be "undeleted" for the file to recover.  And
most DIR programs only look at extensions to compute size, not to
list (i.e. if there is no extension 0, then it ignores it).

Go back and look for MORE "deleted" files of the same name.  Undelete
them ALL.  [Note that some may be legitamitely deleted from earlier
work.]  Then DIR your file.  If its there, *immediately* copy it to
another disk.

Do you think Modula-2 will be a successful language in the Micro
world?  I recently purchased Turbo Modula-2 from Echelon, and have
mixed feelings about the language.  Although I don't think there is
any question that straight M2 is a better language than straight
Pascal, most M2 enhancements were already incorporated into Turbo
Pascal (and other successful implementations of Pascal I believe).
Indeed, I think that Wirth liked certain features of Turbo Pascal and
'C' language, borrowed them to rewrite Pascal, and named the result
Modula-2.

On the negative aspects of M2:

 1.  The explicit IMPORT of every identifier that I want to
     use drives me crazy.  It wouldn't be so bad if there
     were only 2 or 3 modules to import from, but there are
     so many!! I'll never complain about
     #include <stdio.h> again.

 2.  The lack of a general purpose output procedure (e.g.:
     Pascal's WRITE/WRITELN or C's printf() ) makes output
     routines a nightmare.  Using 4-5 procedure calls to
     write 1 line to the console is a pain.

 3.  Linking in entire modules rather than individual
     procedures (which I took the bother of identifying
     with IMPORTs) leads to large object code. This may
     just be a problem with Borland's linker though and not
     inherent to the language.

I would be interested in the comments that you or any of your
associates may have on this matter.

          Sincerely,

          Bob Kemp

Hello,

   I had read BYTE 1983 vol. 8 num. 8. about C compilers. I found that
Aztec C is the best in all CP/M-based C compilers. Aztec C require to
MAC to assemble files into objects that Aztec C creates. In Super C128
don't require that assembler to re-assemble files into object files.
I decided that Super C128 is better for my Commodore 128. C128 costs
59.95 and is avaliable at Most Bookseller's Software Ect. Our nearby
mall have the large good Bookseller Software Ect that sells Super
C128. It must be popular! Many people bought them the same! I missed

Subject: MEX Batch mode solved

Well, it looks like I wasn't the only one having trouble with batch mode in 
MEX.  Thanks to Steve Grandi at noao.arpa for the solution.

As he (and others) said, MEX uses the XMODEM-BATCH protocol, not the
YMODEM-BATCH protocol. (here I'm only talking about the public domain
version of MEX, version 1.14, I hear the commercial version supports both)
XMODEM-BATCH is a kludgy implementation of a batch protocol, but it works.
YMODEM-BATCH is a more 'elegant' implementation which allows passing of 
much more info about the file and is not restricted to the CP/M notion
of what a file name should look like.  For documentation on the two
protocols, look under pd:<misc.protocols> at simtel20. There is 
documentation on XMODEM-BATCH and a more generic description of both
xmodem and ymodem (don't remember the exact names noe, but they are obvious
if you can get a directory listing).

Steve also provided a copy of his 'xmodem' program which supports x/ymodem
batch protocols, 1K/128 packets, and CRC/checksum in any combination.  As 
it turned out, I had to modify the batch send code to work with my C128.
The time required to create the new file was longer than xmodem wanted
to wait around for the NAK/C following the file name transfer (5 seconds),
so xmodem was giving up before MEX (on a C128) got back to the transfer.

So, the answer is, if you need to talk batch using MEX to UNIX running 
4.2/4.3BSD, Steve's xmodem will do the job.  If you are using a C128,
the file send.c which is part of his package, needs to be modified to
wait longer for the C/NAK following the name transfer.

If anyone has any questions about what is needed, let me know.

In-reply-to: Msg of 21 Apr 1987  00:22-MDT from jdb at ncsc.ARPA (Brown)

At one time, I wrote out a description of the MODEM7 protocol as then
implemented by the TOPS-20 version, called MODEM.  Although TMODEM has
replaced MODEM with many changes, the description of the protocol with
respect to the timeout values used remain essentially the same.  The
major difference is that a multiplier of four is used instead of three
for determining the timeout value for a data packet.  TMODEM and MODEM
before it sends the data packet as a string in a single system call
rather than sending each character in the data packet with separate
system calls and associated timeouts.

These timeout values were empirically determined over many transfers
under a variety of line conditions and delays and significantly
contribute to the robustness of the protocol.  Unfortunately, these
values were incorporated into MODEM7 late in its life while undergoing
a power struggle, and probably never made it into many of the current
versions claiming to be "xmodem" compatible.  In fact, many of the
so-called versions of "xmodem" in the pc world are based on a very old
description of the protocol that doesn't even include CRC mode, much
less the MODEM7 "batch" mode.  Fortunately, both MEX 1.14 and all
subsequent versions of the commercial versions of MEX, MEX-PLUS and
MEX-PC, do use these improved timeout values.  I cannot speak for YAM
and YMODEM, but I suspect they use similar values.

So, those of you wishing to "improve" the timeout values should
consider checking out the values given in PD:<MISC.TOPS-20>MODEM7.DOC.

BTW, I must agree that the YMODEM batch method of passing filename and
other information is definitely superior to the MODEM7 method.  TMODEM
may incorporate that option someday as well...

Actually, Turbo Pascal did not innovate anything.  All the good stuff was
lifted from UCSD Pascal (with some massaging to make it fit as native code
on the z80 and 8088's; for those what don'know UCSD Pascal is compiled to a
stack machine language called p-code then interpreted by hardware specific
interpreters).  However, UCSD didn't really innovate much either.  They just
collected a number of the academically favored language facilities and added
them to pascal to get a real language.  Meanwhile, over in Europe, Wirth was
developing Modula (NOT Modula-2 yet) which incorporated many of these same
ideas and some that had given rise to the C programming language.  There were
problems with Modula (just as there had been with pascal).   However the world
was no longer starving for a programming language which was both concise
and powerful, so Modula did not get heavily adopted.  This allowed Wirth to
come along with another language, Modula-2, before anyone took Modula to heart.
Modula-2 changed substitute new broken constructs for old but made some
progress also. (Personal commentary, I HATE UPPERCASE RESERVED WORDS!  They
heavily detract from the readability of code.)

Some M2 compilers provide a source include directive so you can do this.

This is a consequence of not wanting special predefined procedures or functions
nor allowing variable parameter lists.  A clean strongly typed language is
going to have this kind of problem.

Since there can be hidden objects/functions inside of modules (which the
procedures you want are dependent on) it demands a very sophisticated linker
and dependency information to properly support selective linkage.  You are
not likely to find this in an inexpensive system.

SIMTEL20 during the month of March, 1987.  The numbers following
the filenames are the file size in bytes followed by the file format.
(7) means ASCII, (8) means binary.

For a complete list of all CP/M files, see:
   PD:<CPM>CPM.CRCLST - Complete list with CRC values
   PD:<CPM>FILES.DIR  - Abbreviated list with only directory and file names

A couple of weeks ago I downloaded SOFT80.COM from the C64 directory, written
by Chris Lampton. This is pretty difficult with a Commodore 64. I did it
with the regular C-64 Kermit and then used a program to transfer from C-64
format to CP/M format.
I do get 80 columns on output, but between every character that is echo'd on
input there's a space. This space is printed before every character.
If I use a full-screen editor like the one from Turbo Pascal I see spaces when
I move the cursor. But if I scroll forward and then back again the spaces are
gone. Can anyone help?

In his mail from 17 April '87 Richard C. Secrist asked about replacement of
the video processor in the Commodore 64 to make the CP/M cartridge work.
Yes, I did "win".
But: I tried the cartridge with several 64's and some older types work, some
newer also. There's no logic in it! I myself had the oldest of all the ones
I tried but it didn't work!
I received the other VIC-chip from a friend who had a broken 64 and didn't
mind swapping. Here in Holland there are also several shops where you can buy
the chip. So stop looking for oldies and try a brand new one!

	Does anybody have a fix for Applicard CP/M on the Apple gs to get
rid of "mouse" characters when using inverse video?  

	I tried turning the mouse characters off before booting, using a
C program to 'poke' both the alternate character set switch and the status
byte and embedding control characters to get rid of "mouse" characters in
cursor home-and-clear-screen sequences.  All to no avail.

	Thanks in advance.

    Before you make a decision on whether to buy Super-C 128 or Aztec C,
I must remind you that you are actually comparing apples and oranges here.
Aztec C is a CP/M compiler, and generates code for the CP/M mode of the
128 (the special 128 version can also generate code for the 64 or 128 mode).
Super-C 128 is a 128 mode C compiler, and generates code for the 128 mode
only.
    In short, make sure you know whether you want a CP/M compiler or a 128
mode compiler before you buy one, since they are ttwo separate things
Actually, the Aztec C version for the 128 would be perfect, since it compiles
for all three modes, but the price is a bit steep compared to the
alternatives...

I think the screen driver is poking the values directly.

I got a file called new2e80.dvr from the SIMTEL20 archives, and it understands
not to put mousetext on the screen.  I believe it came with the ZCPR3 library 
or BackGrounder II code for the PCPI applicard.

	Recently I read a american electronics journal
	( Electronic Design I think, but it's not sure ).

	There was article about Zilogs new processor Z280,
	which is (according text) Z80:s superset with
	16-bit arithmetic, memory management, user/supervisor states,
	on chip timers, dma and cache.
	Clockspeed is 10 MHz (future 25 MHz) 

	When I was reading article, I start to wonder,
	would there be any use for this kind of product,
	or is this or last strike of Z80-empire.

	Any opinions?

	In last three numbers (feb, mar, apr) of

From GEnie's CP/M RoundTable:

     Zilog finally does it--the Z280 is here!  It's what the original
Z800 was said to be and more.  The Z800 has been rumored for four years
now as a super chip that is still compatible with the Z80.  The chip is
an extension of a Z80, much more so than the HD64180.
 
     The Z280 runs all Z80 instructions (and therefore all 8080
instructions) and includes an expanded set of 45 new instructions plus
additional addressing modes.  It has both 8-bit and 16-bit signed and
unsigned multiply and divide instructions.  The set has over 600
instructions.  At clock rates of 10 megahertz and above, 16-megabytes of
memory address space, and 8-bit Z80 bus or 16-bit Zilog Z-Bus,
capabilities far exceed Intel's 80286 used in IBM PC AT.  Addressing
modes offered make high-level languages more effective than ever.  Using
the Z-Bus, an extended Z80 instruction set is available and a CPU that
is true 16-bit, as is the 80286.  The Zilog Z280 is a highly integrated
CPU, major functions are a paged memory-management unit with a 256-byte
data and instruction cache, three-stage instruction pipelining, a
four-channel DMA controller, three 16-bit counter/timers, a six-stage
wait-state generator, a DRAM refresh controller, and a high-speed UART
with rates up to 2.5 mHz.

     High Tech Research is planning to use the Zilog Z280 in their
"Ultraboard", an add-on board for all '84 Series CP/M Kaypros including
the 10-83.  The High Tech Research Ultraboard is now in beta-testing for
a summer release and has a target price of less than $500.
 
     You will be able take the cover off your CP/M Kaypro, unplug the
Z80 chip, plug the Ultraboard into the Z80 chip socket, attach the
Kaypro monitor cable to the Ultraboard, and your CP/M Kaypro will run
with a processing speed of 12MHz, up from its' current 4MHz, with an
effective throughput up to 10 times that of a normal CP/M Kaypro in
situations that aren't I/O bound (limited by disk access speed, etc.).
It will come with 1 megabyte of RAM, expandable to 16 megabytes,
configurable as a RAM disk by the user.  You will be able to choose your
own foreground and background hues on an external RGB color monitor.
The board supports Virtual Memory and Cache Memory.
 
     The Ultraboard's Z280 on-board Cache Memory automatically stores
all recently used instructions and/or data, so the processor has instant
access to them for memory fetches, and subsequent disk and memory
accesses are eliminated.  On chip Cache Memory can reduce bus
transactions by a much as 75%.  Its Instruction Pipeline functions like
three co-processors built into a single chip, internally processing
multiple instructions.  As the first processor is handling one
instruction, processors two and three are simultaneously working on the
next two instructions.  Pipelining contributes dramatically to the
Ultraboard's improved processing speed.
 
     High Tech Research had to replace the Kaypro screen driver so the
screen could keep up with the Z280's processing speed.  The Ultraboard
includes a new 18MHz no-wait-state graphics screen driver, with its own
256 byte Cache Memory for instantaneous screen updates, 25 times faster
than your current screen.  No more waiting for the screen to catch up
with your programs.
 
     The new screen driver comes with an RGB connector so you can attach
an external color monitor to your Kaypro and select your own display
colors.  You can even design your own character sets, and switch between
them and the standard Kaypro character set.  The graphics chip set (GKS)
on the Ultraboard contains a subset of the new GKS Standard.
 
     The Ultraboard supports multi-tasking and networking.  But like the
286 and 386 processors, full realization of these Ultraboard
capabilities awaits the completion of an operating system, already under
development, specific to the new processor.
 
     A power kit supplies continuous backup battery power to the RAM, to
keep the memory capacity of the machine always active, during a cold
boot, a power failure, or even when the computer is turned off.  The
Ultraboard provides pin-outs for an SCSI bus, enabling the processor to
support up to 300 megabytes of hard disk storage.  The package will
include enhanced version of Handyman, which will remove the 8K limit on
notepad, for example.
 
     High Tech Research has in development a high speed interface
between the Ultraboard and the PC.  This will eventually permit the
connection of the CP/M Kaypro to a cheap PC clone for hard disk storage,
and for use as a network file server.
 
     As far as pure speed goes, the Ultraboard should be at least
comparable to a standard AT.  The real question is whether there will be
any software written to take advantage of it.  Standard CP/M software
should run but won't take advantage of the extra memory, which will have
to be used as a RAM disk.  High Tech is in contact with some people who
are interested in converting programs to the new chip.  Depending on how
the chip itself handles the extra memory, it might be easy to convert a
program to look for RAM beyond 64K and use it if found.

Elan Software makes an excelent WWB product, including
ditroff and some drivers. Don't have the paper address,
but their net machine is ihnp4!chinet!steinmetz!elan.

Super product and support!

	Does anybody have a fix for Applicard CP/M on the Apple gs to get
rid of "mouse" characters when using inverse video?  

	I tried turning the mouse characters off before booting, using a
C program to 'poke' both the alternate character set switch and the status
byte and embedding control characters to get rid of "mouse" characters in
cursor home-and-clear-screen sequences.  All to no avail.

	Thanks in advance.

Has anyone out in net-land typed in the assembly language optimizer

interested in getting a copy.  Please e-mail all replies.

Look in the last few issues of "Dr Dobb's Journal".  There was a series
articles detailing an nroff imitator for (I think) MSDOS.  Program is
available from the publisher at some low price (I don't remember, since
I wasn't interested, but I would guess ~$50).  Includes source code, I
think.

In the last few issues of Dr. Dobbs Journal of Software Tools there has been
a series of columns describing an NROFF clone. It can be ordered from a
California publishing house and includes the complete source. The claim
is that it has full macro capability and comes with -ms.

I have not used the package but plan on getting it eventually. I hope
this helps.
