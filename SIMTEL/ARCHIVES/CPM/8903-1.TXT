Subject: CP/M Software House(s) ???

Hello,

I am posting ths for a friend who has a Toshiba Model T100 (Z80?) with
64K RAM running CP/M (1.7?).  He has two 5.25" floppy drives.  I am an
Unix/MS-DOS user (please, no pies in the face ;-) ), so I don't know too
much about it.  He thinks that it is supposed to be similar to Kaypro's
of the smae time period.

What we need to know is:

1) Who out there has and/or is still using this machine (or similar) ?

2) Where in the U.S. can you buy (mailorder) PD or Commercial CP/M
   software for this type of machine?

3) Can someone tell which of the sub-level directories of the SIMTEL20
   CP/M archive would apply to this machine?

Again, we really don't know much more about it, so please excuse our
ignorance.  We are hoping to find some good software out there to maintain
the machine's usefulness.

Please email responses to me and I will relay them to him.  He currently
does not have net access.

Thank you so much in advance!

Mark.

Both Intel Hex formats are substantially different from Motorola 'S' records.

Subject: Checksum program (was: Intel Hex Format Records)

    FYI:
        I have a program (written in C ) that reads a file containing
     Intel Hex format records, verifies the checksum of each record
     and produces a file checksum for the data fields only (i.e. the
     kind of checksum an EPROM programmer may give you if it read a chip
     that contained the data only).

       I find this useful in two situtations:
        1) verify the programmer downloaded the file correctly,
        2) verify that data files transferred from the programmer to
           the computer arrived OK.  I like storing EPROM data online if
           it contains code that I don't maintain. If an EPROM goes bad,
           I don't need to buy one from the equipment manufacture, just
           burn a replacement.

   The program name is: cksum
   If there is a great enough respondce, I'll try posting it to the 
  appropriate newsgroup ( sources.misc or whatever it's called) else I'll
  send copies to all requesters.

    The program is written in a very easy to understand style and contains
  comments.

Reference Hard disk backup on CPM System:  An immediate solution is to
use NSWP.  Log into your drive using D* (which means all user areas),
wildcard tag all files; and then say copy to your floppy drive (ex A*).
When your floppy becomes full, remove and insert another floppy and then
say mass copy again.  Do not retag the files.  NSWP will copy the files
to all the floppys in the respective user areas on the floppys and are
recoverable using a reverse process with each floppy to the hard drive.
Better ideas are available using zcpr3.  Rick Charnes is publishing an
article in a future issue of The Computer Journal on a methodology he
uses.

Keith, since I assume that he mailed the check to them, and since I assume
that CBM still advertises in magazines (which are usually mailed to subscribers),
a talk with the local postal inspector may be in order.  After seeing how the
postal inspector is going after the person in New York (or wherever he is),
maybe he can find a bored PI who would love to attack a big company.  (Assuming
that the company refuses to refund his money within the alloted time.)

On another note, also dealing with the post office:

Someone, in some news group some time back, mentioned having problems with
the mailman folding floppy disks.  I have a friend who subcontracts rural 
delivery for the PO, and he told me that, if the mail carrier ignores your
explanations, then you should complain to their supervisor.  It *will* go
on their record.  You might *first* warn your carrier that folding disks
is not acceptable, and if it continues then you will have to report it to
their supervisor.  Also, you may wish to have someone send you a disk
*insured*, and when it arrives folded, collect on the insurance.  All these
things (collected insurance, reports of damaged mail) will go on his record.

Of course, you do have to first decide if your delivery person is a total jerk
who will attempt to retaliate by such federal crimes as intentionally delaying
payments and bills, or even not delivering such items.

(Most of the above is *not* directly from my friend.  He only suggested that
having a talk with the carrier's supervisor should help.  The rest is my
pontification.  Standard disclaimers apply, I suppose.  Your mileage may
vary.)

As an ex-mail carrier, I thought I'd add a side note before irate postal
customers thrash the wrong person inadvertently!

You get mail six days a week, at least at your residence.  Mail carriers
work 5 days a week, usually with a rotating day off.  This means that at
least *once* a week (more during the flu season or summertime) a less
experienced carrier is handling your route.  These are professional "subs"
who may carry five different routes each week, but sometimes are carriers
just starting out who haven't the seniority to "bid" on a permanent route
of their own.

Point is, if you have a delivery complaint CHECK THE DATE OF DELIVERY before
your call in the postal supervisors.  They may mistakenly berate the regular
carrier, when in fact the sub was "on" that day, and was responsible.  

Note: this is not meant to castigate the subs.  When I was a 90-day temp
as a lad in Illinois, the professional subs (T1's) were well-respected and
paid more.  It's no mean feat to memorize deliveries for five entire routes!!

I just gave one of those away.  They're still supported to a very limited
extent by Toshiba's Printer Division.  I have a T-200, which has an 8085.
The T-100 had a Z-80, as you said, but the serial port was a software
emulation of an 8251.

Any generic CP/M software should work, but I never had much success
with the IOBYTE stuff, and I couldn't find a customized CP/M Kermit
for either the T-100 or T-200.

Yes and maybe.  DARPA will be stopping funding of what we call ArpaNet in
April or May of this year (I forget the exact date).  All the connectivity
will remain provided that each university/company/etc. ante up $$$$ to keep
and manage their own connection.  I know that USC is taking charge of
managing some/most/all the LA network.  Cost may be an issue: prices I have
heard vary from $30k to $75k for startup connection PLUS $30k-$75k/yr usage
fee.  In short, the net must now be fully self-sustaining without direct
goverment funds.

My guess is that more than a few companies and universities will flee the
net, but as to how few or how many is anybody's guess.

As far as connection to simtel-20 and such, I don't know.  Maybe Keith
has an answer to that one.

That is basically it.

I have a friend who is still sporting a Real Live Northstar Advantage

a home-written program buuuut it had NOT even been tested and it is full of
bugs.  He has the serial card, connected to his printer, and he simply wants
to use it for a modem if possible.

If anyone can give me any archive sites for obscure stuff like this, they have
a (hopefully) working assembler.

couldn't add more than the existing two drives without PC board
hacking, but check and see if someone has tried+failed just from the
hardware end first.

ps. Does anyone know if Software 2000 is still in business? I have a

the Model 4 (in fact, the Model 4P I am typing from...) If there is
anyway to "liberate" TurboDOS, I'd go though the effort to liberate
the drivers for the ported version (myself and two others hold
copyrights to the drivers.) The floppy driver (which I wrote) could
read DSDD on the Model4D, and in fact it could read some 40 different

Subject: TurboDOS Kermit Summary and Travel Report

The question: is there a kermit or [xyz]modem in Z80 assembler, or any
version already built that works with the TurboDOS T-functions?

The answers:
1) Ken Yap <ken@cs.rochester.edu> pointed me to the ftp directories on
cunixc.cc.columbia.edu, which have the master sources for Kermit for
EVERYTHING. Well, almost everything. They also have a Public Domain
Assembler and Linker for CP/M, which can compile the CP/M Kermit
distribution. 
2) Frank J. Wancho <WANCHO@WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL> suggested Ron
Fowler's "MEX" program, of which an early release can be found in
simtel20 PD2:<CPM.MEX>. This several variants of Xmodem, kermit, and
others. Frank also pointed out that TMODEM was the name he gave to his
own TOPS20 version of MODEM7; I have also seen a UNIX modem program of
that name, so it was a common idea, but as Frank pointed out, it is
just a name, not a different protocol.
3) Robert Bloom <rbloom@apg-emh1.apg.army.mil> pointed out that both
IMP and MEX have overlays for TurboDOS, and that the latest Commercial
version of MEX+ v1.65 has a built-in installer that supports TurboDOS.
He also mentioned 1800-niteowl as the phone number for Ron Fowler's
company.
4) David Goodenough <dg@pallio.UUCP> mentioned QTERM, a program which
is written in Z80 assembler (though a custom one) and supports Kermit
and X/Y MODEM. 

It turns out that there are two different versions of TurboDOS support
available for MEX - one of them includes an extension module for
passing through blocks of data to the Master in a Master-Slave system
when the Master has the modem and you are using it from a slave; the
other may be simple T-fxn calls, I never got deep enough to tell.

Now for the interesting part: I actually have a Kermit running. 

1) I got MLOAD from simtel20 PD2:<CPM.STARTER-KIT> (which has lots of
other neat stuff too.)
2) I got XASM.SHAR[12] from PD2:<UNIX-C.CPM>.
	a) It didn't unshar. To fix this: change all ` (backquote, 96
decimal, 060H) to ' (forward quote, 027H). These are all in comments
(backquote doesn't mean anything in normal C, and in some mutant
versions it means "begin BCD constant", or at least it did a long time
ago.) and they interfere with the unpacking (at least under 4.3BSD)
because the "sh" of the unshar thinks it has to evaluate them.
	b) Once it unshared, it didn't quite compile. To fix this,
find several occurances of '\' in the files produced and make them
'\\'. I don't know why this didn't survive shar'ing, and haven't had
the time to check. The shar file has them doubled, but passing them
through sh ate one level of quoting.
	c) It is an effective assembler, except for one thing: it
can't build the Kermit distribution. (see below) To fix this, I added
the "LINK" operator. I just hacked it in, eventually I'll try to make
it cleaner, but that worked.
3) I got kermit/a/cp[sx]*.asm and a few other relevant files (also
kermit/aaa*, for the 'readme' stuff.) There wasn't any documentation
on how to "just build it", but on reading though some of the files I
figured out:
	a) First, asm80 cpsker. This gives you the system independent
cpsker.hex, around 62K of hex file, which is the base. This should be
common to most systems; download it, MLOAD it, and if you run it
you'll get "not configured for any system".
	b) Next, asm80 cpxtyp. This builds cpxtyp.hex, around 3K (for
me) of hex file, which has the system dependent stuff. To actually get
the right content, you have to have set flags in a few places, or i my
case add if/endif sets. Stragtegy: pick a system that is "as weird as"
yours, then just use it as a template for figuring out what you have
to customize.
	c) download cpxtyp.hex, MLOAD kermit=cpsker.com,cpxtyp and
opoof, you have a kermit. Run it, discover that it works in connect
mode but spits out continuous streams of "k" in send mode, and try
again. :-) [this was a symptom of my screwing up the push/pop pairs
around the modem send routines... ddt to the rescue! and it worked.]
	d) download ROGUE.LBR, unpack it, and relax for a while :-)
then delete it, because it takes 30K of a 180K disk and you only have
two drives to use.
4) I downloaded a software set that gives me the same software on the
UNIX and CP/M side:
	CP/M	Unix
	LASM	asm80
	MLOAD	?
	UNARC	arc
	UUD	uudecode
	UUE	uuencode
	USQ120	usq
	SQ111	sq
	LU	lar
	KERMIT	ckermit
		zmac, zdis

There is other corresponding software, but all of the above is Public
Domain. I also haven't finished searching the archives. (CP/M is,
after all, a hobby for me...) 

I'm still looking for an EMACS... however, SmallC21 is probably my
next endeavor. After that, maybe a Z80/CP-M emulator for Unix...

My one problem at the moment: while kermit downlaods and uploads fine,
when I get or put a file, and it prints the filename on the screen, it
immediately follows it with about 5 lines of garbage. It appears to be
running beyond the end of a buffer, but it is hard to tell where to
start (I checked prtstr, and nothing looked obvious...). Next stop ---
ddt. 

Thank you for your attention, I hope someone else is able to use some
of this information. If you want the LINK patches to XASM (asm80) even
as they are, I can send them to you. If you run the archive and want
them, send me mail and let me know and I'll send them to you when I've
cleaned them up. If anything above is wrong, please let me know...

The file server at RPICICGE has been having a bad streak of luck the last
several weeks.  Many more requests where coming in than could be handled,
and all but requests for the smallest files were getting rejected.

A recent change to the server itself and some on-going changes to the
gateway from NYSERNET to the ARPANET have caused a noticable improvement.
Most requests are now being handled first time whereas before they were
being rejected every time.

In addition, there is a completely identical server located at NDSUVM1,
and it has apparently experienced fewer connectivity problems....

Subject: Vector 4 modem problems

     I have recently purchased a vector-4/40 and a lot of disks. It
didn't have a modem, but I have a Sinclair 300/1200 baud modem and
a rs-232 cable that the ports both on the modem and on the computer.
I have Terminal programs, Mex, Modem7 or something like that, and
ASYN something. I can get modem7 to say that it is dialing using the
"Cal" command, however the modem doesn't do anything discernable
(No lights flash or anything). The program says ATDT and stops.
How can I change ATDT to AT DP, and can I "Talk" directly to the
modem through some wierd CP/M or Vector-4 command? Any help would
be appreciated.

Re Vector 4 Modem Problems--You can talk directly with the modem while
in Mex/modemm7 using the T command from the MEX>> prompt.  You will then
be talking directly with the serial port.  If the sinclar modem is a
hayes Compatable, the dial command should have done something.  I
suspect since you did not see any lights (rd or sd lights) blinking,
that the port is not initialized (ie the computer does not recognize the
port is there).  You should have some config program that allows you to
set the baud rate, keypad definitions and the like.  This is a program
that is usually on your CPM master disk.  Since you have cpm running, I
guess you would have this.
  One other thing comes to mind as I think about this is that modem7/mex
need overlays for the machine you have in order for the program to under
stand where the serial port is.  If you have not received a modem7/mex
program with the overlay already installed, you need to do that first.
Go back to the place where you got the mex and look for an overlay file
for your machine.  The name might be MXO-VT11.AQM or something like
that.  You will need to assemble it and then load it over mex.  I hope
this will help.  Ric Lewallen

Are there utilities like _nulu_ for extracting files from .LBR archives
which run on UNIX(tm)?  Is there source code available for such
utilities?  I can't find any in the simtel archives (from looking at
file-names).  I can't find any in comp.sources.unix, either.  I suppose
that once I extract the files, they'll be compressed, so I'll need
uncompression utilities on UNIX(tm) as well.  I have seen compress,
compact, arc, and splay-compress, but I have never seen crunch /
uncrunch on UNIX(tm)...  Does anyone else out there work on UNIX(tm)
machines a lot and have a CP/M machine at home?

I currently have to down load the .LBR archive-files to my CP/M
machine, extract all the files, then up-load the documentation again to
print it on the UNIX(tm) host.  Thanks in advance for your help.

The trs-80 model 4 supports 4 drives, double or single sided, 40 or 80

standard drives, but it should since the 4D has double sided drives.
The model 4p will only support 2 drives, but it still has support
without modification for both sides.
   Montezuma Micro supports double and single sides, and almost any
drive type.

Subject: Vector 4 Modem problems: The saga continues

     Ok, This is what I have so far: Got this vector 4 and a samsung
modem and a RS-232 cable between the two. I have the RS232 plugged into
the far right serial port (The one marked serial com.) When I turn the
modem on after I've powered up the computer, all the lights that should
come on come on, but SD and RD also come on. I used config to initialize
the modem port, so that is not the problem. I hooked the modem to the other
port to see if the labeling was wrong, but though just the right modem
lights come on, my terminal software (Mainly KERMIT, though I have mex and
mdm700 too). A consultant here thinks maybe my RS232 read/send pins are
in the wrong order. Could this be causing my problem? I know the modem
works because I tested it on an IBM PC. I have three hypotheses right
now: 1) My computer was damaged in the mail, 2) Got the wrong port or
software, 3) The RS232 pins are in the wrong order. Now, if my computer
was damaged, the self test that it goes through before booting should
tell me. Would either of the other two be causing my problem?

Subject: Bug in CP/M Turbo Pascal 3.0

I was having problems in a large program used for image processing which made
frequent use of the 'mod' operator. Positive numbers worked fine, e.g., 
  
             7 mod 5 = 2,  or  5 mod 7 = 5

Negative numbers are handled badly.

             -7 mod 5 = -2  [OK]    BUT:   -5 mod 7 = 5  [WRONG!!!]

The latter result was causing the problems.  I thought maybe I had the
operation's definition wrong, but the manual for TP5.0 says that the result
always carries the sign of the first operand.  The 3.0 manual doesn't really
define the operation.

The operation DOES work properly on the MS-DOS (shudder) version of TP 3.0,
only the CP/M version is flawed.  I assume this problem has been aired, but 
this will serve as a reminder for those like me who missed it!

RE:  Vector 4 & modem -- It will not hurt to try swapping the pins on
the 232 ports.  The two that you need to swap out are pins 2 & 3.  I
recommend doing this before thrashing any further.  I do not supect your
computer is damaged, rather the pinouts or the software incompatability.
Try that and see what happens.  One other idea, if you have another
machine.  Hook the two together thru the serial ports and see if you can
see what the Vector is sending out the port.

Sometime between 1200 and 2000 Eastern Standard Time, today (Monday
March 20, 1989), the host IP address of WSMR-Simtel20.Army.Mil will
change from 26.0.0.74 to 26.2.0.74.

This may or may not affect your connectivity to Simtel20, depending on
whether your host uses a host table or a domain server.  Our new
address will appear in the domain database at the time of the
changeover.  It will also appear in the next NIC host table that is
issued.

The symptom you will see if your host uses a host table that has not
been updated is "Connection refused".  If this happens you may still
be able to connect by using our new 26.2.0.74 address instead of our
host name when you request FTP to open the connection.

In order to transfer the system tracks (and make a disk bootable),
you need to run your SYSGEN program.  This program is hardware specific
to each machine, and will copy the first two (or whatever is required)
tracks from a bootable disk to another new (or non-system) disk.
The program will vary slightly from machine to machine, but it goes
something like this:

	A>SYSGEN
	SYSGEN Version n.n
	Source drive name: A
	Dest.  drive name: B    (or A if you only have one drive)

Be sure to write protect the original disk (remove the write enable tab).
When you enter the source drive name, the program will read the system
boot track(s) into memory.  When it has finished, it will prompt you
for the destination drive.  If you only have 1 drive, remove the original
and insert the disk you want to copy to.  THEN AND ONLY THEN, enter the
destination drive name.

Hope this helps.

Subject: Serial card help

Is anyone here familiar with the Jade S-100 serial/parallel card? I've just
fixed my brand new S-100 system after 2 months of work, and I've managed to get
everything working; except the serial card. This is VERY frustrating, seeing as
when I boot my system, I see CPM v. 1.4 etc... on my video screen, and I can't
do anything else except stare at it because I can't type anything! I have no
idea what the problem is, I've detected pulses at the serial input whenever I 
press a key; however, the DATA AVAILABLE line stays high, and RECIEVE DATA
AVAILABLE' won't go low to reset DAV...Another thing is, I wrote a simple test
program to output a stream of A's to the port, along with the control port 
data. Because I used a simple loop(I'm not too famailiar w/ Z80 m/l.), the 
control data is continuously outputted to the port. However, I can't detect a 
pulse on CONTROL STROBE', meaning that it is not getting the data. The only
cause that I can think of is that I have the port address set wrong. However,
I've checked, double checked, and rechecked the port switches, and they are 
set right.

If anyone can help me on this, I will TRULY appreciate it. It's very 
frustrating to get 10 S-100 cards working, and be stuck on one little serial
card...

Yep, the documentation is quite clear in what it has as well as what it
is missing.  Items *NOT* supported in SmallC v1.2 are:

	- for
	- do/while
	- switch/case/default
	- multiple dimension arrays
	- goto
	- float (although it does support double)
	- structures
	- unions
	- multiple indirections (two or more * such as **i)
	- assignment operators (+= -= *= etc.)
	- storage classes
	- precompiler stuff other than #define/#include/#asm/#endasm
	- declaring a function AND its function type in the same line
		(e.g. double foo(i) int i; /* will not work */)
	- probably other things too

For a free compiler and a learning tool (you get the source code), it
is pretty decent.

I use "lar.c".  I have no idea where the source came from at this point
but could probably find it on backups if someone is desperate.  Snd
requests to "sir-alan!mikes@uunet.uu.net".  

There is also a utility for reading 8" SSSD CP/M format diskettes on a
UNIX system that has an 8" floppy (DEC, Tandy 6000, etc.).  I have used
it on a RS 6000 and it worked fine.  The version I have is called "ucpm"
but there is also something called "cpm" from the BSD distribution.

About the serial ports in Vector 4:
  Serial printer port and serial comm. port are made of exactly the same
hardware, only the pins 2 and 3 (xmit and receive) are in different
order.
  So, in order to use a modem via the serial printer port you must make a
cable (or adapter) with wires 2 and 3 crossed. Then you must modificate
your terminal program's port definitions (I hope you have the source!)
so that instead of reading/writing via the serial comm. the terminal
program reads&writes via the serial printer port.

I have a 192 K HZ120 with a single intermittent 5.25" and two very workable 1
meg 8" drives.

The unit has been in storage for some time, seems to work, but is fairly
useless without the CPM floppies it usedta have.

I also don't have any useable version of MSDos for it.

Is there anything I can get, preferably but not absolutely on 8" SD floppies?

I'd like to put the old dog back to work, give it to a friend or something
but it might as well be an outboard motor sans O.S.

The current version of Small C is AT LEAST 2.1 - and it DOES support:

	- for

	- goto
	- assignment operators (+= -= *= etc.)
        - precompiler stuff including:

		#ifdef
		#ifndef
		#else
		#endif
		#asm

	- int foo(i) int i;  /* DOES work - or should */

Version 2.1 is a considerably better version than 1.x - I'm surprised
there are any 1x implementations anywere.

Also, does anyone know possible sources of software for a machine this

Hello. Well, after about two months of work, I FINALLY managed to get my S-100
system up and running. It's an Ithaca Audio CPU w/ a Tarbell single density
disk controller. The system works pretty well, I was able to load up almost
all of the disks that I got w/ the system. However, the format program won't 
work. I've recompiled it twice from the original source code, and all it 
does is move the head to track 0 and go in a HLT condition. Is it possible
that there is something wrong w/ the drive? It can't be the program, as it
was used by the previous owner many times, and gave him no problems...

Any ideas?

.
I got a archive file containing data files from a BBS. The file is
archived, but cannot be unarc'd with unarc16. Evidently, it uses
the "squash" technique, which unarc16 does not handle for CP/M. The files
are normally used for MSDOS and I've successfully unarc'd them using
"PKXARC" on MSDOS and transfered them to my computer. Does anyone know
of a CP/M program that will handle this format of archive? Or have I
finally found a reason for moving to MSDOS?

Any help will be appreciated. Thanks.

Bob, are you really sure you have UNARC 1.6?  It DOES handle squashed
(PKWare) members.

If you're talking about ARCs made by NoGate Consulting's PAK program
which makes "crushed" members then you are right.  UNARC 1.6 will not
handle those.

Subject: Backing up P&T CP/M

For Greg Argendeli who is having trouble backing up his P&T CP/M
boot disk:

  Greg, if you are using versin 2.2E (or even older) you may have
a problem.  Version 2.2E had copy protection on the boot disk -- you
could make as many boot disks as you wanted, but they all had to be
made from the MASTER diskette.  Older 2.2a-d version had a SYSGEN
utility which had to be run in order to move the boot tracks (which
are single density, partly!).

  If you have a current version (2.2m or 2.2mH) then just run CLONE
and follow the questions.  If not, you probably should consider 
getting upgraded.  The upgrade for you (since you already have the
system) would only be $45 plus $3.50 shipping.  If interested (and I
hate to sound commercial here, but this IS the answer to your question)
send a note to:

		TriSoft
		1825 East 38 1/2
		Austin, Texas  78722
		(512) 472-0744

Be SURE to give your OLD P&T serial number, and if you want 2.2m (floppy
only) or 2.2mH (floppy plus hard disk).

I *do* have a relationship to TriSoft, but will  not get rich off of
a $45 transaction.

Bill,  send me a mail address (U.S. Postal).  I think I have a copy
of the manual somewhere around here.  Be glad to send you a copy.

Subject: Redialing Phones

   Martin Olivera asked about phones that automatically redial a busy
number.  One of the most famous of these is the Demon Dialer from Zoom
Telephonics in Boston.  It does much more than redial; it is a complete
phone enhancement system.  It is installed in series with the incoming
phone line and thus gives its capabilities to all telephones in the
house or office.
 
   It serves as a repertory dialer (allows numbers to be associated with
abbreviated strings, such as #MOM to call home), it will rapidly retry a
busy number, and it will at intervals retry a number that does not
answer.
 
   One factor you should consider is whether the telephone has busy TONE
detection.  I have what is otherwise a very nice telephone, the AP2002
that you see in the DAK catalogs.  It is the best speakerphone I have
ever heard, has a full typewriter keyboard, stores hundreds of numbers
under alpha codes, and will automatically redial a busy number. 
However, it only knows a number is busy by inferring that from its not
answering after some thirty seconds.  The smart modems, of course, can
detect the busy tone and disconnect immediately.  Listening to the busy
signal for thirty seconds every minute can get rather annoying.  It
would also be nice if the phone would supply a local ring signal to
alert you when the call does go through.  The Zoom Demon Dialer may have
these features, but I am not sure.
 
   Here is the address and phone number of Zoom as I got it from the
phone book:
 
          Zoom Telephonics      617-423-1072 (general)
          207 South Street      617-423-1076 (tech support)
          Boston, MA
 
   They are coming out in the next several months with an even more
spectacular product.  It will be a complete telephone subsystem that can
be controlled from your personal computer.  Demon dialing is only a
small part of its capabilities.  It can handle two incoming central-
office lines and four local lines, which might be connected to voice
telephones, modems, fax machines, and so on.  It does its own touch-tone
decoding and voice synthesis.  Here is a scenario.  A call comes in on
line one.  A synthesized message asks you to press key 1 for the fax, 2
for the modem, 3 for voice.  Suppose you ask for the modem.  It can then
request that you key in a password before it will connect you to the
modem.  Or, wherever caller identification service is available from the
phone company, it will check the phone number of the CALLING party and
act accordingly.  This is where your personal computer comes in.  There
are many interesting possibilities here!
 
   I have no connection with Zoom except as someone fascinated by their
products.  Though I always yearned for a demon dialer, I never did buy
one.  However, this new gadget, I suspect, will be beyond my powers to
resist!

I had a similar experience.... The version of UNARC16 I had was 1.2 jun86.
Through Simtel and some BBS's I got two newer versions:
1.42 jan87
1.6  march 87

So far I've had better luck with these, but only with ARC's generated by
the SEA ARC program. I have my doubts about the now defunct PKARC.

If you want these files, let me know

    Have had one for years.  It has all of these features, and works 
well.  When it is in a 'continuous retry busy' or 'continuous retry no 
answer' mode, it essentially owns the line, since the telephone from 
which you have activated it must be off-hook.  So, it announces with a 
loud beep tone through the receiver (if you tell it that the instrument 
is a speakerphone) or nothing (if you tell it that you are holding on to 
the receiver) when either it manages to make a connection or a new 
incoming call comes in.  Also does nice things with long distance 
numbers, dialing codes, etc.
   No affiliation, just a happy user who considers this one of those 
nice devices that provides a lot of capabilities and is completely 
unintrusive (it lives in the closet, does not dictate what it have 
on my desk, and the fact that it provides the same features, and the 
same abbreviated number list, to all phones simultaneously is much nicer 
than going around and reprogramming a number of devices).  The one I've 
got is tone-line and tone-phone-activated only.  They also have or had a
pulse version, which I gather is a bit less capable.

Reference Demon dialer discussion - my father acquired a demon dialer,
which is an impressive device, as Jay said (guess ll still does not talk
to dockmaster, eh).  HOWEVER, it had a very short lifespan.  It was sent
back to factory twice for repairs, and then my dad gave up on it.  I
don't know if voltage surges or line noise or what got to it, but it did
not seem to stay up very long.  Hope their new device is more reliable.
