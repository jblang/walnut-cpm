How 'bout just an alt.homebrew? Some of us still do hardware
hacking at home, ya know. 'Course, we're talking about RISC
now (which reminds me an awful lot of the 6502, for
some reason-technology comes full circle), and floppies

Many, many moons ago before I had ever taken a cs class, I used
to use a northstar.  Some years after, someone told me that it
was really easy to call a dos routine from basic.  Could someone
give me an example?  Just for fun; I'll probably never see another

I used my Northstar, several years ago, to hold one end of a carpet I was

Perhaps we have the beginnings of a net contest here. Anecdotes, please.
For instance,  has anyone investigated which makes the best paperweight:
the Horizon, or the Advantage ?

I have a Horizon and Cromemco System Three.  I am trying to get the 
Cromemco working (its original 8" drive is shot) so I can handle soft-
sector floppies for software exchange.  My plan is get BDS C running so 
I can start prototyping boards for data acquisition and control stuff.

I am very interested in starting a homebrew discussion.  Has anyone ever
worked with Vector's S-100 prototyping boards?  Are there any other sources 
for S-100 prototyping boards?  How far off is the Northstar S-100 from
IEEE-696?  War stories?

Up until just recently (within the last year) I had been using mine as
a dialer/terminal to talk to my "main machine" Sun. Then one day about this
time last year drive A: died with a howl. Too bad, because I figure
that the old Horizon earned me about $100,000 over the years that I
used it.

It's now watching me sadly as I type this on a Compaq.

I have just received an Advantage.  I don't know anything about this
machine, and I'm still trying to get some operating disks.
Could someone tell me a little about it?  Is it worth fooling with?
Any info or maybe a couple of points of contact
would be a great help.

Thanks,

Mack -

The Advantage is a great CP/M computer with not only good graphics hardware,
but also pretty good system software for using it.  However, since it's only
good for CP/M, I don't suppose there's much activity on it nowadays.

Incidently, I ran into an odd bug with the graphics software.  It's been
quite a while, but as I remember it had to do with the secondary linking
operation that added the system graphics software to a user program.  For
user programs of certain _sizes_, the link step failed.  Shrinking or enlarging
the user program allowed it to work again.  I notified Northstar, but never
heard about a fix.

(If you were hoping for an active community of Advantage users on the Internet,
I expect you'll be disappointed.  There have been fewer than a dozen messages
total in this newsgroup, at least over the last four or five years.)

  We are using a Northstar to collect experimental data in a psychology
lab (rats and pigeons).  We want to use the serial port to ship data to
an AT, which captures the data using Kermit's session log feature.  (The
Nortstar "prints" the data to the serial port.)  How do we change the
baud rate on the Northstar?  Without modifying our CPM configuration.
  Thanks for the help, all you Northstar fans who thought they weren't
really used any more!

If you are using the Horizon, you change the jumpers.  I never used
an Advantage so I don't have any idea about that one.

Many, many moons ago before I had ever taken a cs class, I used
to use a northstar.  Some years after, someone told me that it
was really easy to call a dos routine from basic.  Could someone
give me an example?  Just for fun; I'll probably never see another
NS.

I used my Northstar, several years ago, to hold one end of a carpet I was
unrolling and laying down.


Perhaps we have the beginnings of a net contest here. Anecdotes, please.
For instance,  has anyone investigated which makes the best paperweight:
the Horizon, or the Advantage ?

I have a Horizon and Cromemco System Three.  I am trying to get the 
Cromemco working (its original 8" drive is shot) so I can handle soft-
sector floppies for software exchange.  My plan is get BDS C running so 
I can start prototyping boards for data acquisition and control stuff.

I am very interested in starting a homebrew discussion.  Has anyone ever
worked with Vector's S-100 prototyping boards?  Are there any other sources 
for S-100 prototyping boards?  How far off is the Northstar S-100 from
IEEE-696?  War stories?

Up until just recently (within the last year) I had been using mine as
a dialer/terminal to talk to my "main machine" Sun. Then one day about this
time last year drive A: died with a howl. Too bad, because I figure
that the old Horizon earned me about $100,000 over the years that I
used it.

It's now watching me sadly as I type this on a Compaq.

I have just received an Advantage.  I don't know anything about this
machine, and I'm still trying to get some operating disks.
Could someone tell me a little about it?  Is it worth fooling with?
Any info or maybe a couple of points of contact
would be a great help.

Thanks,

Mack -

The Advantage is a great CP/M computer with not only good graphics hardware,
but also pretty good system software for using it.  However, since it's only
good for CP/M, I don't suppose there's much activity on it nowadays.

Incidently, I ran into an odd bug with the graphics software.  It's been
quite a while, but as I remember it had to do with the secondary linking
operation that added the system graphics software to a user program.  For
user programs of certain _sizes_, the link step failed.  Shrinking or enlarging
the user program allowed it to work again.  I notified Northstar, but never
heard about a fix.

(If you were hoping for an active community of Advantage users on the Internet,
I expect you'll be disappointed.  There have been fewer than a dozen messages
total in this newsgroup, at least over the last four or five years.)

  We are using a Northstar to collect experimental data in a psychology
lab (rats and pigeons).  We want to use the serial port to ship data to
an AT, which captures the data using Kermit's session log feature.  (The
Nortstar "prints" the data to the serial port.)  How do we change the
baud rate on the Northstar?  Without modifying our CPM configuration.
  Thanks for the help, all you Northstar fans who thought they weren't
really used any more!

If you are using the Horizon, you change the jumpers.  I never used
an Advantage so I don't have any idea about that one.
