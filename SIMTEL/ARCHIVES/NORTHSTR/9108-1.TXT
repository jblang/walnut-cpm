Greetings,

I have a sudden need for information about Northstar computers.  I
need to (somehow) get a 12 user Northstar system to communicate with
an Novell network.

I can find no source of information about these systems and the system
I have has no manuals with it.

Could some please point me to a source in the United States of
information about Northstar and perhaps a source for Northstar
equipment and/or software?

Please respond via e-mail as this group is not available on my site.

Thanks.

Mark Reay.
