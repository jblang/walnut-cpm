I have a Northstar Horizon (64k, 2 double density disk drives, Soroc IQ
120 terminal, PMMI internal modem, many disks, software; 2 serial, one
parallel port) for sale. If you are interested, e-mail me. A follow-up 
post will detail the software, etc. (and I will reply directly if I get
any response).

However, here are some of the details (from memory): includes NS DOS, 
NS CP/M operating systems; CP/M based "Nevada" COBOL and FORTRAN, with original
disks and manuals; an early version of WordStar, with original disks and
manuals; UCSD PASCAL with orig. disks and manuals; many versions of N* BASIC
with  etc.; and over a hundred of the peculiar, hard-sectored diskettes
that <<ONLY>> N* computers could read/write. There's lots else, but this
is the gist of it. Tonight, I'll do a complete inventory for posting/e-
mailing as I noted above. 

The system works fine, with one small glitch: a few of the keys on the SOROC
terminal exhibit what I am called is termed "keybounce" -- that is, sometimes
you get TWO characters instead of one. By a few, I mean literally 2 or 3.
I fired it up the other day and typed a few score sentences on the order of
"0123456789 quick brown dogs jumped over the lazy fox !@#$%^&*()_+[]{}\|"
and so forth to test it.

Gee - I wonder if anyone out there remembers this old system?!

PS, since I suppose I should specify a starting price, let's say
$500 or best offer (remember, this could have museum value some day!)
