I'm trying to bring up an old system for a friend, and having severe 
problems, hope there are some people out there who can help.
Background:
The system was working about 1.5 years ago, but recently refused to
boot from the C: drive, although it could still be booted from the
original system disc #1. We attempted to reload the floppy discs using
the specified default username, password and went into manager mode
to do the SETUP utility.  Partitioning was apparently OK, as was 
a format.  Next step was (from the sys. manual) Press [F6] to proceed...
At this point there was activity on the A: drive, followed by dead
silence.  Checking the manual, it appears that there is a step missing
form the written instructions, since there is never a message or ???
to indicate that system disc #1 should be removed.
However, the next page of instructions says "Remove system disk #1 ...

In a desparate attempt , we attempted changing disks at the point 
where it appeared that disc #1 had all been read, the sys. gave an
error message indicating that service personnel should be called.

Questions:
1)  Does anyone have a clue as to what's going on? As an additional
point, the system discs are labelled as Version 1.1.0.
 2)  There is a tape backup for the system, but no tape utility on 
the system discs, nor does it exist on any of the owner's other
discs.  Would some kind soul please consider E-mailing me a copy 
of TAPE if you have it?
3) Does anyone know of a source of info. for this venerable system.
It seems that the dealer who used to sell it in this area is most
reluctant to even answer phone calls concerning the problem

This is my first attempt at using Pnews, hope it comes out alright.

Thanks in advance,

Hi CPMers,

If any N* people out there are interested in kermit I have ported it.
This was thanks to the good offices of Alan Latta and Mack Goodman and others
a _long_ while ago.

To help repay this moral debt, I am willing to provide the thing on floppy to
reasonable numbers of people.

Mail me for details, which I will finalise in a couple of weeks.

Chuck
