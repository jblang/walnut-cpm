  I need help!!! I have a lot of experimental data stored in a NorthStar 
machine. It uses 51/4" floppies and "NorthStar DOS" which I can't read 
into any other computer. I need to recover this information somehow and 
I am not enough of a hacker to write a code to do the trick. Is there any one 
out there who knows how to do this? Is there any chance that Kermit was 
ever ported to the NorthStar? Any other suggestions?

                                                          Thanks,

There is a card that you can buy from MicroSolutions (same people who make
the UniDos Z80 card that has been discussed here recently) that will allow
an XT or AT to format, read, and write NorthStar hard-sector-format CP/M
diskettes.  I assume that these are the same diskettes as those for what you
refer to as NorthStar DOS.  If you have only a small number of diskettes, I
would be willing to have you send them to me, and I would convert them to
some other standard format (such as MS-DOS 360K or 1.2M 5").  There would be
a few simple conditions, so check with me first.  If you still have the
NorthStar machine, I do have a version of MDM727 (MODEM7) for it -- that's
how I used to get files to and from that machine.

You should know that North*Star DOS is nothing like CP/M.
Fortunately the North*Star DOS disk layout is so simple
you can hack it by hand if necessary, the directory is
on the first four sectors and files are simply blocks
of consecutive physical disk sectors.  If anyone went
to all the trouble of handling the CP/M disk layout
surely they also provided for N*DOS disk layout?

While doing some cleaning, I found several Northstar (and other) boards
and other stuff I've accumulated over many years.  Is there ANY market
for such things now, or should I just trash them?  I have:
*  4 Northstar 16Kbyte S-100 dynamic RAM boards (fully populated),
*  4 Northstar 16Kbyte S-100 dynamic RAM boards (UNpopulated),
*  3 Solid State Music S-100 music maker boards (NOT RAM!),
*  2 Digital Group 16Kbyte static RAM boards,
*  1 Computalker S-100 board,
*  1 Cromemco S-100 DAZZLER board,
*  1 MPA S-100 board (adapts a 6502 chip to run on an S-100 bus),
*  1 Northstar S-100 Micro Disk controller board, and
*  1 whole VECTOR 4 computer with a 10 MByte hard disk, a 600Kbyte
     hard-sectored floppy drive, 128Kbyte RAM, a "modified" (i.e., no
     on-card voltage regulators) S-100 bus, and over 100 diskettes of
     stuff including dBase II, BCSD (?) C, assembler, a spreadsheet, a
     word processor, CP/M (8-bit CPU) AND CP/M-86 (16-bit CPU) (and
     I've been offered a Vector version of MS-DOS for only $80!)

I'd like to SELL everything, but whatever I do, I've got to make more
room in my computer "shack" for incoming stuff!
