Hi,

  A while back, I acquired an old Northstar Dimension from a company that
was replacing it, and am now trying to get it working.  Apparently, the only
problem is the hard drive--it won't even spin.  I could replace the hard
drive, however I don't have the Northstar Dimension Operating System
software. (Northstar DOS and Netware)  I have heard of a place where I
could buy this software, and would do so, except--I've heard that a
password from Northstar is required to install the software.  This would
be a problem since they aren't around anymore...

  So, what I would really like to find is someone with an old Dimension
sitting around somewhere that they aren't using which already has the
software on the HD, who would just sell me the HD.  Any other suggestions
or information would also be greatly appreciated...
