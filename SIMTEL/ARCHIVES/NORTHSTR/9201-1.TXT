Well, I owned a N* dealership, but never did I use a dimension. I went to
high skool with two guys I opened the store with (We were all in high skool),
both of whom went of to do more with N* that I. The first guy I know I 
talked about before, Chip White. He has a bad habbit of not returning
fone calles, but for Advantage/Horizon stuff, try hime a 216-775-1314. He
is a tour manager for a musician (sp?) and will be back in Ohio after Sunday.
Chip became one of a very few guys in the country to fix/support N* after N*
droped A/H. He is pretty much out of "the biz", but may have some good contacts.

The second guy I have not seen in a while, but we were like borhters many
years ago, Tom Johnston. Tom went to work for N* in CA, and did stuff with
the dimensions. I don't really know what. Tom worked at Northern Lights 
Computers in Berkley also. I know Tom no longer has much of anything to
do with N*/and any corporate remains, but he might know someone who knows....
I don't have a number for Tom handy, but if you are interested, drop me a note.
He lives in Berkley -- try information if you like.

Don't remind me how much I paid for that ST506 5 MB hard disk.....

I just acquired a Northstar Dimension from my Church (were
churches the only ones to buy these things?).  The system had
intermittent problems and ha been shoved in a corner for the

  I still haven't actually gotten any actual copies of the hard disk OS for
the Horizon Rich gave me.  I did get a couple of e-mailed promises, but no 
disks have yet arrived.  So, I make my plea once again.  Does anyone out
there have copies of the Hard Disk OS (HDOS or, if it exists/ed, CP/M) for

There was so little activity in this group that I dropped it off my register
list. Imagine my surprise to randomly check it and see 7 whole messages!

I've owned a NorthStar Horizon for about a year now. Paid $15 for a full up
system with two double-density disk drives and lots o' memory. Talk about
price/performance!

Anyway, the note about the single-density disk controller being a turkey
made me think about the problem I've been having with the double density
controller. There seems to be a race condition between the hardware that
deselects the drive after 30 seconds or so of inactivity and the software,
which checks to see if the drive has been deseleced before using the drive.
Turbo Pascal 3.01A seems to always land right in the race; that is, it will
decide that the drive has not yet been deselected and then the hardware will
deselect the drive before it starts being used. System hangs nicely. Comments?
I've got some version of Lifeboat CP/M and have probably incorrectly described
the problem; it's been a while since I played with it.

I've actually pretty much retired my N* because it's impossible to find 
hard-sectored diskettes these days. I gave most of mine along with a N* to
a friend's girlfriend who just needed a word processing engine.

Well, I owned a N* dealership, but never did I use a dimension. I went to
high skool with two guys I opened the store with (We were all in high skool),
both of whom went of to do more with N* that I. The first guy I know I 
talked about before, Chip White. He has a bad habbit of not returning
fone calles, but for Advantage/Horizon stuff, try hime a 216-775-1314. He
is a tour manager for a musician (sp?) and will be back in Ohio after Sunday.
Chip became one of a very few guys in the country to fix/support N* after N*
droped A/H. He is pretty much out of "the biz", but may have some good contacts.

The second guy I have not seen in a while, but we were like borhters many
years ago, Tom Johnston. Tom went to work for N* in CA, and did stuff with
the dimensions. I don't really know what. Tom worked at Northern Lights 
Computers in Berkley also. I know Tom no longer has much of anything to
do with N*/and any corporate remains, but he might know someone who knows....
I don't have a number for Tom handy, but if you are interested, drop me a note.
He lives in Berkley -- try information if you like.

Closing arguments:
Don't remind me how much I paid for that ST506 5 MB hard disk.....

I just acquired a Northstar Dimension from my Church (were
churches the only ones to buy these things?).  The system had
intermittent problems and ha been shoved in a corner for the
last year.  This box does not have an s100 bus, It appears to
be similar to the IBM PC's (62 pins).  Also, has a custom CPU
chip and an 80186.  I don't have software or any terminals, so
its doubtful I can use it as a system.  Does anyone know if

  I still haven't actually gotten any actual copies of the hard disk OS for
the Horizon Rich gave me.  I did get a couple of e-mailed promises, but no 
disks have yet arrived.  So, I make my plea once again.  Does anyone out
there have copies of the Hard Disk OS (HDOS or, if it exists/ed, CP/M) for
the Horizon?

There was so little activity in this group that I dropped it off my register
list. Imagine my surprise to randomly check it and see 7 whole messages!

I've owned a NorthStar Horizon for about a year now. Paid $15 for a full up
system with two double-density disk drives and lots o' memory. Talk about
price/performance!

Anyway, the note about the single-density disk controller being a turkey
made me think about the problem I've been having with the double density
controller. There seems to be a race condition between the hardware that
deselects the drive after 30 seconds or so of inactivity and the software,
which checks to see if the drive has been deseleced before using the drive.
Turbo Pascal 3.01A seems to always land right in the race; that is, it will
decide that the drive has not yet been deselected and then the hardware will
deselect the drive before it starts being used. System hangs nicely. Comments?
I've got some version of Lifeboat CP/M and have probably incorrectly described
the problem; it's been a while since I played with it.

I've actually pretty much retired my N* because it's impossible to find 
hard-sectored diskettes these days. I gave most of mine along with a N* to
a friend's girlfriend who just needed a word processing engine.
