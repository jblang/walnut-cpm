Subject: ZCPR and NorthStar BIOS

Does anyone have source code for a NorthStar BIOS?  I would like to install
ZCPR on my system, so anyone out there currently running ZCPR (2 or otherwise)
on a NorthStar, could you please send info. regarding installation.  Since
UMVMA has only mail access, I can't dig through the archives to look for any
of this information, thus if anyone would be willing to download the stuff if
I sent a disk, drop me a note.

Thanks in advance,
                   -Kevin Altis

Where is UMVMA pray tell?  If it's associated with U of MD, then I suggest you
contact my friend Bob Hayes (RWH@MIT-MC but he hasn't logged in since Feb '84)
who has a North*Star system, and is a very talented computer hacker.  Home
phone is 532-0336, in Falls Church, VA.
