Subject: Earth TurboSlave I and Horizon

I have recently purchased two TurboSlave I cards, intending to use one
in each of two Horizons I have and network them together.  Both cards
work very well in one system, but will not reset in the other.  That
other system (used) appears to have an ancient motherboard (the system
also randomly locks up, but that's another story and a clue).

The question for the day is: does anyone have access to some old
dealer notes to see if there was a fix to the reset (and the hang)
problem(s) that was fixed in a later rev of the board?  As best as I
figure, this is the original motherboard, s/n 05007F, retrofitted with
a power supply mod to support more than 5 slave cards (an off-board
heat sink).

Thanks,
Frank
