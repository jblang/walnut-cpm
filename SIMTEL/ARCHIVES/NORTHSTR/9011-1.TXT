I know this letter is going to shock all of you out there, but 
I thought, 'WHY NOT?"   I am hoping to find some repository of
N* Advantage software that I can get through FTP anonymous or
telnet to a public bbs.  I know of the north star computer society
in seattle and they have a way to mail order public domain disks
but it would be nice to be able to log on and tranfer directly.

Any ideas?

Anybody got some good sources they would like to help me with?

Greetings!
I hope I'm doing this right, this is my first message on UseNet. I'm used
to the PC/MS-DOS world of FidoNet. I just wanted to let the word out that
I've got a Northstar Advantage computer that's gathering dust in my closet
if anyone wants it. It has one 360k hard-sectored floppy drive and a
Seagate ST-506 5 meg hard drive. It also has a SI/O card and a weird
little 8088 card with 128k RAM onboard that supposedly ran MS-DOS v1.0. I
have one disk for this creature - the system disk. I also have the docs.
Anyone who wants it can have it. Call Bill @(303)988-2505 or leave me mail
here. Thanks.

Thanks to all who responded to my query regarding the surplus Northstar I 
have (had). I have promised the machine to the first respondent - I really
had no idea that so many of you would be interested! Thanks again.

Subject:  Clear screen
Message-ID:  <9011271520.aa19816@crdec8.apgea.army.mil>

This is a real simple question.  Please give me a simple answer if
that is possible.

Let's assume I know very little about ASM files, etc.
Which is sort of true.  If I attempt to run a program I have 
which is a COM file and it does not clear the screen properly, it 
just keeps overlaying the screen, can I modify the ASM file to
correct this for the Advantage?  If so I would appreciate
it someone could lay out step by step what needs to be done.

I don't have a manual or anything for the Advantage.

Thanks for your help.....

Wull, I don't know if *YOU* could, but *I* could even modify the COM file.
Not to say it would necessarily be easy.  Presumably your program is trying
to clear the screen and failing, or maybe it doesn't even try at all?  My
guess is it sends out some control or escape codes and they clear some kinds
of screens, but not your particular screen.  How do you know it even tries 
to clear the screen?  I take it you ahve an ASM file, but are having trouble
figuring out where and how it tries to clear the screen?
