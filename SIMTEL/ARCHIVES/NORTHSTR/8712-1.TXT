Does anyone out there have any information on a S-100 computer named
GOLDSTAR.  I was resently given this machine, but it does not work.
I have no documentation.  I need schematics and listings.
The unit has a 8085 CPU board, FDC with 2 5.25 inch drives, an I/O
board, memory board and what appears to be a printer interface board.
Any info will help.  Willing to pay for cost of reproduction of documents.

Send reply to "COLE@ARDEC-LCSS"

Thanks
Pete Cole

Does anyone out there know where to get CP/M or some good applications
for a NorthStar Horizon?  My mother has one just sitting around
collecting dust.
