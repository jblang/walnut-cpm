I have a Nothstar Advantage computer that has a CP/M OS with a 5 Meg
hard disk.

I have been able to use the computer by loading the operating system
from a floppy disk in the computer, but I am unable to access the hard
disk.  All attempts at gaining access to the HD result in a BDOS error
being printed on the screen.

Diagnostic run on the HD show that it is functional.

Has anybody had a similar experience with this machine or this type of
failure who can give me some suggestions about corrective action?

Thanks in advance.
