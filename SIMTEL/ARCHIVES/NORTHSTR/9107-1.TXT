Subject: Horizon boot diskette?
Message-Id: <9107141749.AA02878@bessel.umd.edu>

(*sigh*)  I have a Northstar Horizon and no boot diskette.  It has
a hard disk, but won't boot from it -- I don't know whether the hard
disk is actually functional or not.  Can anyone give me pointers 
toward obtaining a copy of MP/M for this beast?  

One of my housemates has a running Northstar Advantage, so if there's
a way to make a copy of CP/M for the Horizon from that, that would at
least get the Horizon running, but I have no idea whether that is 
possible.  (I'd still want MP/M sooner or later though.)
