	Well, as of today, The Communications Oracle went down due to
a power failure during an apparent read/write action on the hard disk.
I am running a NorthStar Horizon under CP/M 2.2.  I tried to re-boot
it tonight, and when the OS tried to load the drivers (HD05BOOT.COM),
I got back 'CANNOT CONNECT TO HARD DISK.  ERROR 113.  SEE PAGE XXXX...'.

If anyone has any ideas (I think it is a soft error, as further response 
from the attempted boot gets "CP/M WORKFILE OPEN..."), please
reply to me.  In the mean time, I need a version of BYE (any version)
that will run on an Osborne Executive.

I'm trying to locate a source for CP/M-80 for an old North Star
Horizon I've acquired.  Can anyone provide a lead?  Also, any details
on upgrading this machine (HW or SW) would be appreciated.
