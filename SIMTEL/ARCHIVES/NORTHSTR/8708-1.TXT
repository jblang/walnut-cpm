I was donated a NORTHSTAR computer system, it is configured with 12
slots 6 of which have 64 k memory cards, labled measurement system and
devices inc.  I have one slot with a z80 cpu card, one with a disk
controller and one with a 6 users multicomm card. I have 8 rs232 ports
altogether and 2 1.2 meg floppies. The system boots, howvwer I can get
no video out of it, nor can I get any type of indication as to what
model number it is, or what I can do with it.  I woudl like to run cpm
and use it multiuser (mpm) for a amateur bbs system. If you could
assist me in diagnosing this unit and help me in setting it up it will
be worth your while. I would like serios northstar users only and I am
also looking for the operting system.

If you can help please call me 4pm-12pm est sun-thur 703-749-2370 all
other times 703-425-3322
