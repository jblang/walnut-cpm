For those that have bothered to try to run Rich Conn's ZEX with
the NorthStar CP/M with a split BIOS - it dona work!

Here is a way you can make it work:

;zexmod.asm   1 July 84  rwb2
;
;This will run ONLY on a NorthStar "64k" CP/M system with the Split BIOS
;with the BIOS located at F300 (which is the default implementation.)
;
;Rich Conn's ZEX (and other "clever" programs) will not run under this
;configuration.  This little memory patch allows ZEX to run.  Once 
;installed, it will stay put until a cold boot.  It "should" not bother
;any other programs.
;
;In NorthStar's implementation, the BIOS is split away from the rest of the 
;CP/M system.  (It was moved to the other side of the PROM at E800h.)  In 
;order that CP/M will "look" continuous, a copy of the BIOS jump table is 
;placed at E700h on the bottom side of the PROM and simply duplicates the 
;"real" jump table now located at F300h on the top side of the PROM.
;
;This program alters the jump table at E700 so that it points TO 
;the jump table at F300 instead of being copy of the table at F300.
;
;		-->THIS SHOULD NOT BE LOADED AS A COM FILE<-- 
;			(unless you "like" 58k files)
;
;Load the patch with the following:
;
;		A>DDT ZEXMOD.HEX
;		NEXT PC
;		E733 0000
;		-^C
;		A>
;
;that's it!  Now Zex and QK will run.
