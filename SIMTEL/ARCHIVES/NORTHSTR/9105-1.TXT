I just got my NorthStar Advantage back from my sister who had
borrowed it.  I don't need it. Is anyone interested in buying
one?  It has a 15 meg hard disk and CP/M, but I know how to
hack the hard disk format program for any size disk up to 30
meg if anyone wanted a bigger disk.  I have some miscellaneous
software for it too.  WordStar, dBase II, Supercalc 2, BDS C
etc.

Any takers?
