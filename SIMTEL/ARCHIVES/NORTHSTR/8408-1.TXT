I have uncovered a subtile bug in GMGRADD, the program that adds the
graphics manager to a user program.  It normally terminates with the
message
         GRAPHICS MANAGER HAS BEEN APPENDED TO YOUR COM FILE.
If the original file has length 48K or larger, you get the message
         YOUR COM FILE IS TOO BIG (>=48K).
The interesting part is that you also get this message if the com file
is exactly 32K (=128 pages or 256 records)!  If the original file is
exactly 16K (=64 pages or 128 records), you get the message
         GRAPHICS MANAGER MAY NOT BE APPENDED FOR THE REASON BELOW:
          WRITE ERROR (OUT OF SPACE PERHAPS).
The workaround for either a 16K or 32K program is to read it in with DDT,
escape to the operating system, and SAVE it, making it just one page
longer.  I called Northstar about the problem long ago.  They didn't
sound interested at the time, but may have fixed the bug by now.  If so,
nobody notified me.
