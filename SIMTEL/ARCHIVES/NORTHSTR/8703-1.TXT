Are there any N* users left out there? The mailing list
seems pretty quiet!

I'm looking for a CP/M spelling checker to run on 
my old Horizon II. Does anybody know where one might
exist (share-ware, perhaps)?

Lets here some chatter out there!

I purchased a Northstar Horizon at a ham radio flea market this
weekend. The box contains a 20-meg hard drive and a 5.25" half-height
Shugart disk drive.  I'm not sure, but I think the system is running
ZCPR3.

My problem --> I can't seem to get the floppy to SYSGEN a new disk.
Each time I try it, the disk is accessed, then the terminal displays
the message; T 5 D 1 S 0000. If I put in another disk, the only thing
that changes is the number after the "T". I thought the problem might
be that the system could not write to the disk, but just PIPing files
works ok.

Since the system came without manuals, I have a few questions.

1.  Does a standard SYSGEN for CP/M work with ZCPR3?

2.  Does T 5 D 1 S 0000 mean Track 5 Disk 1 Sector 0000? Is there anything I
    can do to continue the operation after this message appears? (So far,
    only ^C, which returns to the operating system, and RETURN, which
    repeats the message, seems to do anything.)

3.  Does anyone know where I can get some manuals for this computer?

Any information I could get would be greatly appreciated.
