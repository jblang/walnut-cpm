Yup, that's right.  I have a NorthStar Advantage that I'd like to sell.
It's got 2 floppy drives, 2 serial ports 64K of RAM, etc.

Software, including NS Graphics DOS, PL/I-80 with assembler, BDS C, 
JRT Pascal 3.0 and others I can't even remember, it's been so long.
All with original documentation.

Oodles of 10-sector floppies!

Optionally, an NS-100 graphics Epson MX-100 with the NorthStar Logo.

These goodies have been languishing in my closet (the computer), in
drawers (the diskettes) and in boxes and bookselves (the software and
manuals).  The Epson printer, which has both serial and parallel ports,
has been used continuously since its purchase and has performed flawlessly
all of this time.  (They make 'em faster now, but not better!)

Give me your best offer.
