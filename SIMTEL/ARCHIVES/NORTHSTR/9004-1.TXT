I know someone who has a Northstar Advantage she would like to sell.
She has no idea what its worth. Any offers? It has a Z-80 processor,
2 340K disk drives, a serial port, and a parallel port. It is located
in the Richmond, CA area, so it would have to be picked up here
or shipping paid to wherever. E-mail me at  gimpel@bevsun.bev.lbl.gov
or call me at (415) 658-3582

FYI:
Here in Phoenix, I am aware of two Advantage systems like the one you
describe going for around fifty dollars. I bought one with a hard drive
for a backup to my own for $65 at a local auction.

I'm sure you people are suprised to see a msg from this group,
but why not, I say.

I have an Advantage.  I don't know alot about programming, especially
at the assembly stage.  I can barely 'patch' different programs that
I have to.  I don't know how to 'insert' and change things like that.
Anyway,  The fact is, I just want things to work.  I don't want
to know any more than absolutely necessary about this.

Now here's the request.  I have read some about ZCPR and I would like
to try this on the Advantage.  An old version is fine.  Is there
anyone that can tell me step by step what to do with the Simtel files,
or does someone have this running already and maybe I can send you
a disk to copy it for me?

Fianl note:  I am amazed at this machine though.  I normally use a
MS-DOS system and I have the advantage at home to do wordprocessing
on.  I have taken it apart, swapped drives, and generally beat this
thing up and it keeps "on ticking".
