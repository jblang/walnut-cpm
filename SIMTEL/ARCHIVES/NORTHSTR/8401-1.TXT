        I have an Okidata M82A dot-matrix printer, and a
NorthStar Advantage (running Graphics CP/M rev 2.2). 

        When I attempt to print something out of WordStar
(no flames, please), I find that there is no easy way to get
double-width (5 characters/inch) printing.  The Okidata
users' manual gives the codes necessary to accomplish this
in BASIC, and I can convert the decimal codes to hex or
octal as necessary.  But I can only see (from WordStar) the
commands <control-P><control-B> to toggle bold print (8.3
characters/inch) and the commands <control-P><control-D> to
toggle double print (which just seems to be coming out as
overstrking, not as the 5 characters/inch printing I would
have expected). 

	Are there any good ways to insert ASCII 28(decimal)
to ASCII 31(decimal) into my WordStar text file?  Thanks
in advance.  Responses to me; I will summarize to the net.

Hi,

You want to install patches in the user-defined functions ^Q,^W,^E, and ^R.
These can be multiple key sequences, which is quite handy if your printer
uses ESCape sequences like mine does.  Check your Word* manual on how to go
about defining your own functions.

	Can anyone provide me with the address of a Northstar
Users Group in the Boston area (particularly northeast of Boston,
perhaps the Merrimack Valley)?

I'm a N* user, although right now my system is on load in DC, and I
am pretty knowledgable and would like to know abou any such group too.

Subject:  All-Caps key on Advantage

Has anyone used a program (assembly or other) to change the state of
the all caps key on an Advantage?  So far, all I get when I try to
follow the directions in the Tech Manual is to blow the machine away.
Any ideas would be appreciated.

I stumbled across the following in a dealer bulletin dated early last
year.  The patch supposedly described takes care of a spurious BDOS
ERROR ON A: R/O message.  I have not yet installed this patch, but
plan to after reviewing the surrounding code.
