This is the "read me first" file for the Z80EMACS binary distribution.
It is in ZMAX-B01.LZR;
The source is in ZMAX-S01.LZR
so you can see this is release 0.1!

Documentation:
Z80EMACS.DOC       general intro
POSTING.0          slightly obsolete intro, as posted to internet network news.
Z80EMACS.REF       command reference
MAPKEYS.DOC        keyboard customization
METERM.DOC         screen customization

Installation:
0. Uncrunch the two overlay files that were crunched.
   LU310: error reading unwritten data....
1. Read Z80EMACS.DOC
2. Read METERM.DOC, and customize ME.COM to fit your terminal.
3. If you are familiar with any kind of emacs, just print MAPPING.TXT 
   as a quick reference. Otherwise, better take a peek at
   Z80EMACS.REF ( skim through it ).
4. Try it out.
5. If you don't like the way the keystrokes fit the commands,
   read MAPKEYS.DOC and do what you need to do.
6. Enjoy.
   Z80EMACS can find its overlays if they are on the current drive, 
   or on drive A:, B:, or C: ( your BDOS may extend this ).
   Even if you don't have a hard drive, performance is good.
   I tested this distribution file...

;                  but with it, you could ( if you wanted ) create new
;                  overlays without even having Z80EMACS source...
POSTING.0          part 0 of internet source posting.
