BASIC.C       right arrow and left arrow; bound to keystrokes and also called by many overlays.
BSEARCH.C     search backwards.
BUFFER.C      this is what's left in the root segment from the original buffer.c
CCLASS.C      "ctype" type of stuff.
CCLASS.H      character class, better for an editor than ctype.h
CFGNAMES.H    belongs to mapkeys.c; It's in archive 1; cfgnames.h describes the mappings for overlays in ME.COM. It gives the UECS name, the key to which the name is bound by default, the overlay number, the function within the overlay, and the UECS command number. The default binding isn't necessarily the same as that in mapping.h. This file is included by both mapkeys.c and meconfig.c.
COPYREG.C     "copy region" overlay command.
DOMAPKEY.SUB  How to compile mapkeys.c
ED.H          microemacs main include file
FILENAME.C    rename file; rename buffer
FILEREAD.C    read a new file into current buffer
FILERITE.C    write current buffer with new file name
FILESAVE.C    save
FILEVISI.C    edit a new file in its own buffer, or, go to the buffer that already contains it. Finds their addresses by reading ME.SYM. Both of the programs are pretty nifty
GETREG.C      subroutine included in the overlays of all "region" commands.
GROWWIN.C     make window larger
KBUF.C        store and recover deleted text
KILLBUF.C     remove a buffer from the list of buffers and free its resources.
KILLREG.C     kill region
LDELETE.C     delete "n" bytes
LDELNEWL.C    delete a newline
LFREE.C       free a line
LINE.C        lalloc() and lchange()
LINSERT.C     insert a character
LISTBUF.C     list active buffers
LNEWLINE.C    insert newline
LOWREG.C      lowercase region
MAPPING.H     default bindings
MEDISP.C      display a line
MEDISP.H      microemacs display routines, include file
MEMAIN.C      main()
MEMISC.C      get input
MEML.C        message line routines
METAB.C       binding tables.
METAB.H       include file for programs that need to know about keystroke bindings and how they are handled.
