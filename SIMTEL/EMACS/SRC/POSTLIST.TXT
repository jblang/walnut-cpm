( AZTEC C files are NOT INCLUDED in this library. )

                                ctype.h

                                It bears a copyright notice, but is of no
                                use to anyone who doesn't have aztec C, so
                                I think it's okay for everyone to see it.

domapkey.sub    How to compile mapkeys.c
mapkeys.c               Prepares a mapping of commands to
                                keystrokes.
                                Reads zmecmds.lst, writes maptable.zme.
                                If you want standard emacs mappings, you
                                have to use this program.
mapping.txt             My terminal has two pages of 24x80 display
                                memory. I like to type this file to the
                                screen and keep it available on the page
                                that isn't used, as a quick reference guide.
                                It's very abbreviated; TVI means TeleVideo,
                                M-Y killbuf, TVI "PAGE ERA"
                                means that the key labeled PAGE ERA sends
                                escape-Y and therefore kills a buffer.
meconfig.c              Reads maptable.zme, patches ME.COM
mkconfig.sub    How to compile meconfig.c
zmecmds.lst             Input to mapkeys.c, this gives the UECS name
                                and number for every command available in
                                Z80EMACS.
(cfgnames.h)    It's in archive 1;
        cfgnames.h describes the mappings for overlays in
        ME.COM. It gives the UECS name, the key to which the
        name is bound by default, the overlay number, the
        function within the overlay, and the UECS command
        number. The default binding isn't necessarily the same
        as that in mapping.h.
        This file is included by both mapkeys.c and meconfig.c.

meconfig knows the names of the built-in functions, and it
finds their addresses by reading ME.SYM.

Both of the programs are pretty nifty...

fgets.c
fopen.c
fputs.c
fwrite.c
getbuff.c
getc.c
lseek.c
malloc.c
These files are copyright aztec C, and you have no use for
them unless you have aztec C. Distributing them should do no
harm.
Some of them are modified to save space in the root segment.
This is why you SHOULD have these files if you DO have aztec C

To avoid copyright controversy, the files are slightly mangled;
partial lines are obliterated, and must be reconstructed
from files in your aztec C delivery.
How dull, these are the .SUB files.
They give an idea of what files are involved, and how the
overlays are structured.

MYLIB.SUB was used to make a Z80 version of the AZTEC
library, with some of the subroutines customized.

ALL.SUB and ALL2.SUB were used to compile "everything".

LINKROOT.SUB invokes the linker to make the root segment.

ROOT.DAT is used by linkroot.sub

LINKALL.SUB invokes the linker to make the overlays.

SUBS.DAT is used by linkall.sub

all.sub was too long and had to be broken up into all.sub
and all2.sub; danger, I added a few comments and either
might now be too long.

all.sub is not quite up-to-date. In linkall.sub, you will
see that not all the ".o" files are mentioned in all*.sub;
some ".c" files mentioned in all*.sub are also obsolete, and
not supplied.

The last thing I did while I was working on this was to add
a few more overlays. By force, they had to be in
linkall.sub; but until I recompiled everything, they didn't
have to be in all*.sub. That's why the sub files didn't get
updated.
