This is the "read me first" file for the Z80EMACS source distribution.
It is in ZMAX-S01.LZR;
The binary distribution is in ZMAX-B01.LZR
so you can see this is release 0.1!

Documentation:
POSTLIST.TXT       some file descriptors from the internet posting.
Z80EMACS.DOC       General intro, and commercial
POSTING.0          slightly old general info from the internet posting.

Other files are as described in postlist.txt.

This is mostly a pro-forma source posting, because
1) You need AZTEC C to compile, and who has that?
2) Some aztec files are part of the package ( they were modified for 
   Z80EMACS ), but they're not included here.

Even if the source is not too useful, here it is --
Z80EMACS is open to the world!

This package was done with AZTEC C, version 1.05c;
of course it should be ported over to BDS!
