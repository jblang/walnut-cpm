;; Program: ZDDTZ.ZEX
;; Author:  Fred Haines
;; Date:    April 22, 1987
;;
;; This simple patch makes C.B. Falconer's DDTZ respond to DIR as well as DU 
;; file specifications.  To install, dump any command history processor in 
;; memory, put a copy of DDTZ.COM in same directory with this file, and issue 
;; this command: ZEX ZDDTZ.  That's all there is to it.  If you are using 
;; ZRDOS and want to see what was done, remove the two semicolons from the 
;; last command line in the file.
;;
;; Get DDTZ.COM and it's documentation from DDTZ.LBR, available from most
;; Z-Nodes.
;;
;; This patch does not add length to the program or interfere with any 
;; copyright notice or other console messages, but DDTZ is copyrighted by C.P. 
;; Falconer and may NOT be distributed in patched form.  Please respect the 
;; programmer's rights.  You may patch your copy of the program with this or 
;; any other patch, but do not distribute the result in any form.  This 
;; routine was adapted from the more general one, applicable to many non-Z 
;; programs, written and published by Bruce Morgen in The One-Eighty File,
;; vol. 1, no. 11, 11/87.
