There  is  an error in the code I added to initialisation routine
of Z8E version  3.  It  only  affects users wanting to patch  the
breakpoint  vector address to something other than 38h.
 
To  fix it in the source code,  delete the three consecutive RRCA 
instructions near the beginning of routine ninit:  and change the 
following OR 0F8h instruction to OR 0C7h.
 
To  fix the object code without reassembling,  use the faulty Z8E 
to patch itself.

This patch will be included in the next release of the program.
