918E.LBR         23168  06-08-93  18E.LBR contains a significant upgrade to	18E.LBR
                               | Z8E.LBR (Z80 debug monitor originated by
                               | Richard Surwilo). In addition to all
                               | functions of Z8E, 18E offers full HD64180
                               | support. Also, 18E supports an auxiliary
                               | debug terminal support facilitating software
                               | development of screen oriented applications.
                               | Some bugs are fixed also. Included is a 9
                               | page supplement to Z8E.DOC called 18E.DOC.
                               | The source to 18E is also available in the
                               | 18E-SRC.LBR library file. Damon R. Gibson
9ANY4.LBR         3456  06-08-93  Modification of Bridger Mitchell's routine	ANY4.LBR
                               | from Computer Journal #33 to relocate and run
                               | a PRL-format program anywhere in memory. This
                               | version optionally allows passing of
                               | registers, simplifies program building using
                               | MLOAD, and "pulls" the relocated code down to
                               | the actual load address rather than leaving
                               | the where_am_I and relocator routines in
                               | place and jumping over them to get to the
                               | program. July 18, 1988
9CHKIF.LBR       15872  06-08-93  CHKIF processes .ASM, .Z80 or .PRN files,	CHKIF.LBR
                               | checking that the IF-ELSE-ENDIF statements
                               | are matched properly. It also handles
                               | MACRO/REPT/IRP/IRPC-EXITM ENDM pseudo-ops,
                               | and takes the multi-statement lines of ASM
                               | and MAC, etc. provided they are delimited
                               | with exclamation marks!
9DDTZ27.ARK      74880  06-08-93  C.B. Falconer updates his fabulous DDT	DDTZ27.ARK
                               | replacement to add 64180 opcodes and more
                               | undocumented Z80 opcodes.
9DISA-REL.LBR    49792  06-08-93  REL file disassembler	DISA-REL.LBR
9DISREL.LBR      12672  06-08-93  REL file disassembler	DISREL.LBR
0FILES.PCB       11818  08-25-94	FILES.PCB
9GEN180.LBR      14464  06-08-93  Auto-patcher that converts Microsoft M80	GEN180.LBR
                               | (Version 3.4 or 3.44) into a fully functional
                               | HD64180 assembler. No Z80 or 8080 capability
                               | is lost, so this is a pure enhancement that
                               | adds only two records to the assember's size.
                               | A very nice contribution from West Germany.
                               | November 30, 1987, via NAOG/ZSIG
9L80RST.LBR        896  06-08-93  Speeds up Microsoft L80 V 3.44 by patching	L80RST.LBR
                               | out the disk system resets.
9LASM3.LBR       16896  06-08-93  Link/Asm 3: 8080 assembler with .DOC file	LASM3.LBR
                               | (See discription for lasm3.obj for more info)
9M80STR11.LBR     8192  06-08-93  This is a macro library for the M80 assembler	M80STR11.LBR
                               | that implements some structured programming
                               | constructs such as if.then.else,
                               | do.while.enddo, do.until.enddo, and
                               | switch.case.case.otherwise.endsw. Version
                               | 1.10 fixes a bug in the "switch" construct
                               | that caused bad branches to be generated when
                               | multiple switch constructs were nested. If
                               | you have M80STRUCT.LBR, replace it with this
                               | (M80STR11.LBR).
9MLOAD25.LBR     27136  06-08-93  Update of the very popular MLOAD24 program	MLOAD25.LBR
                               | used by many CP/M owners, in place of
                               | LOAD.COM. This version fixes a problem a few
                               | ZCPR users had with it overwriting the CCP
                               | and then locking the system as a warm reboot
                               | was not offered. This did not affect the user
                               | of the program, only when finished and
                               | sometimes could not exit back to CCP
                               | properly. By Ron Fowler of NightOwl and
                               | MEX114/+ fame. Enjoy ===JERRY M.===
9MUSICBOX.LBR    22016  06-08-93  Sample code that demonstrates DSEG, CSEG and	MUSICBOX.LBR
                               | COMMON functions with the SLR assembler and
                               | linker. These modules link together to create
                               | a small program that plays a tune on nearby
                               | radios. The point of the code however is to
                               | demonstrate the assembler and linker. If the
                               | Z librarys are available then a Z version is
                               | produced otherwise the output is standard
                               | CP/M compatible.
9MYLOAD.LBR      23552  06-08-93  MYLOAD is a replacement for MLOAD and related	MYLOAD.LBR
                               | programs which are intended to load HEX files
                               | to COM or overlay binary files (COM, PRL etc)
                               | with HEX overlays. It is a Z-Tool, and
                               | functions correctly under NZCOM with odd-
                               | sized CCPs and BDOSes. Source and a config
                               | file for changing defaults with Al Hawley's
                               | ZCNFG are included.
0PATDDTZ.SUB      1024  09-02-94	PATDDTZ.SUB
9PATDDTZ.SZB       768  06-08-93  Bruce Morgen supplies a ZEX/EX file to path	PATDDTZ.SZB
                               | DDTZ version 2.7 to default DDT command set
                               | rather than the distributed DEBUG command
                               | set.
9PDLN10.LBR      29824  06-08-93  A Public Domain version of Microsoft's L80,	PDLN10.LBR
                               | Digital Research's LINK, and SLR System's
                               | SLRNK. And it's FREE! PDLN is a linking
                               | loader. It takes one or more .REL files,
                               | which are non-executable files created by
                               | assemblers, loads them into memory, resolves
                               | links between them, and creates an executable
                               | .COM file. Symbol table can be used with a
                               | debugger. It can search through library files
                               | (in the .REL format) and extract only the
                               | necessary modules.
9PROTCCP.LBR      3840  06-08-93  From the time you run PROTCCP until the next	PROTCCP.LBR
                               | warm boot, the system will think that the
                               | BDOS is below the CCP so that transient
                               | programs, and notably debuggers, will not
                               | overwrite the CCP. I wrote this program to
                               | help me debug the new ZCPR command processor
                               | that I am readying for release. I just enter
                               | the command line PROTCCP;DSDZ XCPR.SYM, and I
                               | can perform in situ, full-screen, symbolic
                               | debugging of the command processor. Jay Sage,
                               | 02/05/87

9REVAS25.DOC       896  06-08-93  Al Hawley has released version 2.5 of his	REVAS25.DOC
                               | excellent disassembler into the public
                               | domain. I have used REVAS3 extensively and
                               | love it. Perhaps people will use version 2.5
                               | and develop a taste for the real thing and
                               | want to buy it.
9Z280-J88.LBR    18560  06-08-93  Some messages captured from ZNODE Central and	Z280-J88.LBR
                               | another RCP/M concerning the Z280 processor

                               | could be broken up. From Dan Jacobs
9Z8E-30.ARK     168192  06-08-93  A update to Rick Surwilo's debug/trace	Z8E-30.ARK
                               | utility for Z80 CP/M. Now handles .PRN files
                               | produced by SLR's Z80ASM 1.3 while still
