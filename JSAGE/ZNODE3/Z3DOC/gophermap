9ARUNZNDR.LBR     6784  06-07-93  Explains a technique of creating aliases	ARUNZNDR.LBR
                               | using ARUNZ so that ordinary CP/M programs,
                               | even those that have no understanding of user
                               | areas, can properly reference Z-System's
                               | named directories. - Rick Charnes

9CHOPSUEY.AZT     7168  06-07-93  A tragicomedy of computers and chopsuey. Let	CHOPSUEY.AZT
                               | it be a lesson to all. God knows it hasn't
                               | been to me. For those (we should all be)
                               | running DateStamper, this file has been
                               | crunched with CRNCH23D, the DateStamper-ized
                               | version of CRUNCH. Uncrunch with UNCR23D and
                               | it will preserve the original file's
                               | datestamp data from my system even when
                               | transferred via modem to your own computer. -

9DB-QUIT.LBR      2048  06-07-93  This is an implementation of Bruce Morgen's	DB-QUIT.LBR
                               | idea from using dBase II's "QUIT TO" command
                               | under Z33/Z34 from other than user 0. When
                               | your ready to leave dBase type "DO QUIT" and
                               | the QUIT.CMD program requests a mulitple
                               | command line, resets the user to 0, and
                               | exits.
0FASTARNZ         8576  09-02-94	FASTARNZ
9FASTARNZ.ZZZ     5120  06-07-93  aliases for arunz and keeping them close to	FASTARNZ.ZZZ
                               | directory track on disk.

9HBAUD11.LBR     11520  06-07-93  The generic HD64180 baud rate reader/changer	HBAUD11.LBR
                               | adapted to the 9.216 MHz version of the chip.
9HD-ARC13.LBR    62080  06-07-93  V1.3 streamlined to run faster and smoother.	HD-ARC13.LBR
                               | A series of nesting aliases, an ALIAS.CMD and
                               | a ZEX file I've developed to keep orderly the
                               | backing up of hard disk directories that
                               | require more than one backup floppy. Premised
                               | on the idea of grouping floppy backups
                               | alphabetically, manipulating AC.COM for this
                               | purpose. Extensive and attractive video
                               | displays. DOC file is 32k uncompressed and
                               | reads like a novel. Feedback welcomed. - Rick

0NZENVADD.TXT     6272  06-07-93  Perhaps I've invented the round, rolling	NZENVADD.TXT
                               | object that someone else has offered, but
                               | I've not seen it. This listing of the offsets
                               | from the ENV address in a NZCOM system of its
                               | labels and theri values or addresses in its
                               | *.ZCM files I find quite useful. One can poke
                               | to his heart's content and produce any number
                               | of the marvelous effects of which NZCOM is
                               | capable.
9PARMS.LBR        3968  06-07-93  PARMS.COM displays a table of parameters	PARMS.LBR
                               | passed from command line scripts in ZCPR3.
                               | The table is taken from Z Newsletter #508 and
                               | has been converted to a .COM file using
                               | PRNTXT.COM, Terry Hazen's console/printer
                               | message utility program. See included DOC
                               | file. Bill Tishey, 04/16/87

9README.AZT       3328  06-07-93  Some (negative) comments about the use of	README.AZT
                               | "-READ.ME" as a filename. - Rick Charnes,
                               | 6/27/87
0SHELLIF.MOD      2944  06-07-93  Modifications to the Z3 code done by Royce	SHELLIF.MOD
                               | Shofner that will correct the problem of
                               | being unable to run an alias containing flow
                               | control statements inside a SHSET/CMD
                               | combination, as in SHSET
                               | PROGNAM1;PROGRNAM2;CMD where PRONAM1 and
                               | PROGNAM2 are both aliases condition 'IF'
                               | statements. In all versions of ZCPR that I've
                               | used from 3.0 to 3.15D SHSET will abort at
                               | this point. - Rick Charnes
9TLIB.LBR        12672  06-07-93  TLIB is an alias especially made to read	TLIB.LBR
                               | files, especially crunched files, within
                               | libraries. Its key feature compared to my
                               | previous alias, TLF, is that the user is
                               | AUTOMATICALLY presented with a library
                               | directory after each member file is read. It
                               | consists of a "network" of three
                               | interconnecting aliases: TLIB.COM, TLIB2.COM,
                               | and EXIT.COM. Syntax: "TLIB [DU:] <LBRNAME>"
                               | (space necessary between parameters) - Rick
                               | Charnes
9Z33IF.MSG        3328  06-07-93  An explanation of the "IF $1=//" vs "IF	Z33IF.MSG
                               | //=$1" mystery that Frank Gaude' pointed out
                               | in the latest Z-News.
9ZARTICLS.LBR    44288  06-07-93  This library contains 3 reviews I wrote for	ZARTICLS.LBR
                               | the Morrow Owners Review: Backgrounder II,
                               | DateStamper, and the Mini Winnie hard
                               | disk/ZCPR3 combination. Also includes an
                               | article I wrote upon my tender first
                               | explorations into the ZCPR3 world which
                               | eventually got published in FOGHORN (!). I
                               | want these entered into our communal archives
                               | (our BBSs) before I get too old. Use LDIR-B
                               | to first look this library, and uncrunch
                               | members with UNCR23D if available. - Rick

9ZCOLUMNS.LBR    41344  06-07-93  Before I get old and my hair turns white I	ZCOLUMNS.LBR
                               | want posterity to have these. These are all
                               | my "Forever Z" articles to ever appear in the
                               | Morrow Owners Review (R.I.P.). I LOVED
                               | writing these, and the Morrow ZCPR3 community
                               | that they helped engender has been a source
                               | of great joy to me. BBS's are our historical
                               | archives. When the archeologists come, I want
                               | these to be there. Please use LDIR-B to first
                               | look at this library; uncrunch members
                               | w/UNCR23D if possible. - Rick Charnes
9ZMSGBUFR.TBL     1664  06-07-93  A Wordstar/NewWord-printable chart I put	ZMSGBUFR.TBL
                               | together to help me learn the location of the
                               | various message bytes within the ZCPR3
                               | message buffer. - Rick Charnes
