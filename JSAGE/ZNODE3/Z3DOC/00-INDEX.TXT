ARUNZNDR.LBR     6784  06-07-93  Explains a technique of creating aliases
                               | using ARUNZ so that ordinary CP/M programs,
                               | even those that have no understanding of user
                               | areas, can properly reference Z-System's
                               | named directories. - Rick Charnes

CHOPSUEY.AZT     7168  06-07-93  A tragicomedy of computers and chopsuey. Let
                               | it be a lesson to all. God knows it hasn't
                               | been to me. For those (we should all be)
                               | running DateStamper, this file has been
                               | crunched with CRNCH23D, the DateStamper-ized
                               | version of CRUNCH. Uncrunch with UNCR23D and
                               | it will preserve the original file's
                               | datestamp data from my system even when
                               | transferred via modem to your own computer. -

DB-QUIT.LBR      2048  06-07-93  This is an implementation of Bruce Morgen's
                               | idea from using dBase II's "QUIT TO" command
                               | under Z33/Z34 from other than user 0. When
                               | your ready to leave dBase type "DO QUIT" and
                               | the QUIT.CMD program requests a mulitple
                               | command line, resets the user to 0, and
                               | exits.

                               | A series of nesting aliases, an ALIAS.CMD and
                               | a ZEX file I've developed to keep orderly the
                               | backing up of hard disk directories that
                               | require more than one backup floppy. Premised
                               | on the idea of grouping floppy backups
                               | alphabetically, manipulating AC.COM for this
                               | purpose. Extensive and attractive video

                               | I've not seen it. This listing of the offsets

                               | of the marvelous effects of which NZCOM is

SHELLIF.MOD      2944  06-07-93  Modifications to the Z3 code done by Royce
                               | Shofner that will correct the problem of
                               | being unable to run an alias containing flow
                               | control statements inside a SHSET/CMD
                               | combination, as in SHSET
                               | PROGNAM1;PROGRNAM2;CMD where PRONAM1 and
                               | PROGNAM2 are both aliases condition 'IF'
                               | statements. In all versions of ZCPR that I've
                               | used from 3.0 to 3.15D SHSET will abort at

TLIB.LBR        12672  06-07-93  TLIB is an alias especially made to read
                               | files, especially crunched files, within
                               | libraries. Its key feature compared to my
                               | previous alias, TLF, is that the user is
                               | AUTOMATICALLY presented with a library
                               | directory after each member file is read. It
                               | consists of a "network" of three
                               | interconnecting aliases: TLIB.COM, TLIB2.COM,
                               | and EXIT.COM. Syntax: "TLIB [DU:] <LBRNAME>"

                               | article I wrote upon my tender first
                               | explorations into the ZCPR3 world which
                               | eventually got published in FOGHORN (!). I
                               | want these entered into our communal archives
                               | (our BBSs) before I get too old. Use LDIR-B
                               | to first look this library, and uncrunch
                               | members with UNCR23D if available. - Rick

                               | my "Forever Z" articles to ever appear in the
                               | Morrow Owners Review (R.I.P.). I LOVED

                               | that they helped engender has been a source
                               | of great joy to me. BBS's are our historical
                               | archives. When the archeologists come, I want
                               | these to be there. Please use LDIR-B to first
                               | look at this library; uncrunch members
                               | w/UNCR23D if possible. - Rick Charnes
