Amidst all this ruckus about the difficulty we're having putting 
together a Z3 version of QL I'd like to interject a different note.  
I created a Z3 version of QL31 no problem.  In fact, I made a Z3 
version out of QL24 no problem.  Sort of.
                            
As far as I'm concerned, the *main* thing that "Z3-ifying a straight 
CP/M utility" *means* is giving it the ability to reference a named 
directory.  The concept of "getting its terminal information from 
the ZCPR3 environment descriptor and TCAP" is all well and good but 
is really a minor consideration for me in a program for which we are
furnished source code and the ability to -- without too great a 
difficulty -- otherwise hard-code this information in.  There isn't 
a doubt in the world that this certainly does defeat the very noble 
and important Z3 concept of providing a SYSTEM-WIDE software 
independence from the awesome array of terminals that has played 
such a large role in the demise of CP/M --- but hey, this is life.  
I'd rather enjoy myself than bemoan the demise of all purity in the 
world.
              
I went through the QL31 source code looking for IF ZCPR3 statements 
and the only thing of significance I found besides the 
above-mentioned items was ye old wheel byte information.  All right, 
I know this is important to sysops but for most of us this is not 
directly relevant.  I'm sure, also, that Z3 folks with non-standard 
terminals who labored long and hard to write their own TCAP -- and 
who face the task of changing a large number of equates in source 
code to provide this information to non-Z programs -- might feel 
differently than I.
              
In any case, I don't know if people just don't know about this, but 
in Vol. 1, number 11 of The One Eighty-File, the magazine 
officially for Micromint SB180 owners but practically for all users 
of ZCPR3 that Bruce Morgen puts out there is a wonderful section, 
worth its weight in gold, that provides information on precisely how 
to patch straight CP/M programs (I tire so of the phrase "vanilla 
CP/M" --- who says that "vanilla" is any less fancy than "double 
pistachio berry choco-nut?") the ability to reference named 
directories.  I haven't seen this technique discussed much on the 
BBS circuit so I can only assume either that everyone already knows 
about or that no one knows about it.  Well, everyone _should_ know 
about it; Bruce has done an absolute yeoman's job in this field and 
he has done the Z world a wonderful favor in releasing this gem of a 
technique to us.
              
I used this technique on QL24 months ago and have been doing things 
like "QL24 DOC:PPIP173<cr>" since then with no problem.  I don't 
know what all the fuss is about.  So for those who fall into the 
latter category above be sure to get a subscription to The One 
Eighty File at P.O.  Box 2781, Warminster, PA and ask for back issue 
v1, #11.  (Bruce, do you know you don't provide the subscription 
price in the magazine!?) It's a superb magazine, full of excellent 
tips that for the last year and a half has provided me with a wealth 
of information that has helped me in my wonderful adventures on the 
wild and wonderful seas of Z.
