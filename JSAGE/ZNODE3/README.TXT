The files in this volume are most of the contents of the Newton Centre Z-
Node, Z-Node #3, in Newton Centre, Massachusetts.  I have omitted some files
that I know are included elsewhere.  Also, a few files with characters that
are illegal as DOS file names were lost in the conversion.

The following two files in this subdirectory are very important:

    FOR		descriptions of the files uploaded most recently

    FOR.OLD	descriptions of older uploads, some of which are no
		longer posted on the Z-Node

A third file, ZFILES.LZT, is Bill Tishey's compilation of Z-System files.
