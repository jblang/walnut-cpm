Some  of us have noticed that WordStar 4.0 hangs up or  otherwise
corrupts  the  system  if you have no  Z3NDIR  buffer  specified.
Peter Mireau, of MicroPro, found the problem today.

When WS4 determines Z3NDIRS is zero, it jumps to the wrong  place
and  does  not  adjust the stack pointer.  Happily,  the  fix  is
simple.   In  WS.COM, change the byte at 1251H from 9Ah  to  96h.
That's all there is to it.
