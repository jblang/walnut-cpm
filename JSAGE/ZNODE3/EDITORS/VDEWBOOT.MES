The following came about because of some possible problems with
the Z80DNZCM.LBR that I release a little while ago.

THIS PATCH APPLIES TO ALL VDE266 USERS, not just those who have tried
Z80DNZCM.LBR or the just release .ZRL for Z80DOS2.

Did some digging into VDE266 and found that there is a serious bug in 
the code that is supposed to handle the BDOS errors, such as File R/O,
disk R/O, DATA error. The following should take care of it.

With VDE266.COM in memory, change the following locations to the numbers given
(all in HEX). With a file patcher, the addresses are 100h less in the file
itself.

29B8 <- CD
29B9 <- A7
29BA <- 29

 3 bytes total. It will allow VDE266 to correctly restore the warm boot 
vector at 0 in memory. Before it was restoring it with what it 
originally pointed to! This only happened if the BDOS detected some kind
of error and exited by doing a jump 0 or a jump to the BIOS warmboot entry.
