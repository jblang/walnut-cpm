Jay has contributed some excellent Z-system alias scripts for automating
the BGii startup and shutdown operations.  In addition, he shows how
to change the names of BGii built-in commands.  Useful in their own
right, these scripts are also a model of a well-designed system
environment.

You will need to modify the scripts to reflect your own system's
directory names and custom files.  The FIXBG addresses will vary,
depending on BGii version and the disk parameters of your swap drive.
And BGHIST and BGERRH require BGHIST.OCP.

---------------------------------

     Here are the ARUNZ (renamed to CMDRUN.COM) scripts I use for
the various BG-related operations.
 
1. script BG
 
   This script is used to engage BGii.  It goes to the required directory,
   clears the shell stack if necessary because BGii will invoke BGHIST, and
   then returns to the directory from which this alias was invoked.  The
   explicit directory references before some of the commands just speeds
   things up a little.
 
        SYS:                            ; Go to directory with LOADBG
        IF SH                           ; If a shell is currently running
        SYS:SHCTRL C                    ; Clear shell stack
        FI
        SYS:LOADBG                      ; Invoke BG (runs alias STARTBG)
        $D0$U0:                         ; Return to original directory
 
 
2. script STARTBG
 
   This script is the BGii startup alias.
 
        TIME ON                         ; Turn on time display in prompt
        KEYS GLOBAL                     ; Load my global key definitions
        OCP BGHIST                      ; Load OCP with BGHIST and BGERRH
         FIXBG (leading space)          ; Script to patch BG swap file
        BGHIST                          ; Load BG history shell
        BGERRH                          ; Engage BG error handler
        CLS                             ; Clear the screen
 
 
3. script FIXBG
 
   This script makes the changes to the BG swap file to rename some of the
   resident commands.  It could be a part of the main STARTBG script, but I
   prefer to keep this separate.  I change the ECHO command to ECKO so that
   my transient ECHO.COM, which runs at 8000H, will be used instead.  I also
   shorten PEEK to P and RESET to R.
 
        SYS:DU GF,+9,CA53 K,W,+,CA5A    ,CA7A     ,W,X
 
   Here are the operations performed by each of the disk utility commands:
 
        GF                      ; Go to disk group 000F (the group
                                ; ..containing the command dispatch table)
        +9                      ; Advance 9 records to the one containing
                                ; ..the entry for the ECHO command
        CA53 K                  ; Change-Ascii at byte 53H of the record,
                                ; ..putting in a 'K' in place of the 'H'
        W                       ; Write the changed record out to the disk
        +                       ; Advance to the next record on the disk
        CA5A....                ; Another Change-Ascii (note four spaces,
                                ; ..one to separate command from argument
                                ; ..and three to replace 'EEK' in 'PEEK'
        CA7A.....               ; Another change in same record (five spaces
                                ; ..in all, four to replace 'ESET' in
                                ; ..'RESET')
        W                       ; Write the changed record out to the disk
        X                       ; Exit from DU3 disk utility
 
   The actual records containg the command dispatch table varies with each
BGii release.  What has confused me a bit lately is the appearance in the
swap file of two command lists that each look like a dispatch table.  Only
one is, and the real table has to be determined by trial and error.
 
 
4. script BGOFF=OFF (two alternative names for same alias)
 
   This script exits from BGii and reestablishes the ZCPR system.  Since
   my configuration of BGii uses the RCP space, I have to restore the
   environment descriptor and the RCP code.
 
        IF BG                   ; If BG is currently running
        BG OFF                  ; BGii command to exit
        SYS:SHCTRL C            ; Clear shell stack (of BGHIST)
        SYS:LDR SYS.ENV,SYS.RCP ; Restore environment and RCP
        SYS:ERRSET SYS:VERROR   ; Set up ZCPR error handler
        ELSE                    ; Else if BG not running
        ECHO BG NOT RUNNING     ; Tell user
        FI
