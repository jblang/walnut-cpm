MIDI/1.LBR - GENERAL CP/M
   The Ampro Little Board can talk to MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital
   Interface) devices without so much as an additional baudrate
   generator.  All it needs to perform this feat is a modest adapter
   circuit (see MIDADAPT.SCH).  See MPK.DOC.
   
----
SLRHLP2.LBR - ASM TOOLS

   pseudo-ops.
   
----
ITOZ14.LBR - ZCPR3
   A major rewrite of Robert Doolittle's extended Intel to Zilog 
   translator.  It's now a ZCPR3 utility with a completely new user 
   interface that knows about DU and DIR specs, error and quiet 
   flags, etc., but also runs under vanilla CP/M.  ZSDOS create 
   dates preserved.  No longer warm boots.  ZCNFG configuration.  
   Includes HLP-type documentation and utility to add pseudo-ops and 
   macro names that would otherwise be unrecognized.

----
UNZIP18.LBR - GENERAL CP/M
   UNZIP dissolves MS-DOS ZIP files.  Accepts DU and DIR specs for ZIP
   file and as destination for extracted files. Output filenames are
   supported.  Can be aborted with ^C without leaving partial files on
   disk.  Version 1.6 has much faster disk I/O and no longer checks
   CRC's when listing names of files not being extracted.  Version 1.8
   corrects a few bugs.

   BIOS, or by running a supplied program.
   
----
DU90.LBR - GENERAL CP/M
   DU v. 9.0 is a further development of Ward Christensen's DU program.
   This version is specific to CP/M+ and takes advantage of this to
   therefore be repeated by the use of Ctrl-W.  A 'Handler' module has
   been added to take care of buffering from 128 byte sectors to
   physical sector sizes, so that disk access is reduced.  The disk
   mapping routine has been substantially revised, and the 'K' function
   now has the option to add to existing files.

----
LD14.LBR - ZCPR3
   A ZCPR3 library directory utility that shows member files with 
   their create and modify dates and times, sizes, compression 
   method, uncompressed filenames, CRC's, and indexes.  Embedded 
   comments up to 76 characters can be displayed.  Printer, disk 
   file, and message register output.  Wheel protection.  Also runs 
   under vanilla CP/M.  Version 1.4 corrects a minor cosmetic bug 
   and adds a help file.

----
QT-UPAT.LBR - MODEM/MEX/TERM3
   This patch utilizes the user patch area (^U) set aside in QTERM
   by its author(s). Allows the user to toggle between two ports 
   from within QTERM. It allows one copy of QTERM to do the same
   job as two. Works great for a LAN situation where you have a
   modem on one port and a second computer on another.

KEYIN14.LBR - ZCPR3
   KEYBIOS is a special NZCOM virtual BIOS that implements a 
   keyboard buffer that, having been filled by the utility KEYIN, 
   can provide interactive input to the program that runs next.  
   KEYIN 1.3 is more space-efficient and supports KEYINIOP.ZRL, 
   which even works on non-NZCOM Z-Systems. KEYIN 1.4 fixes a stack 
   problem and a problem involving the prtname routine. Also, 
   BIOS/IOP reinitialization code removed as it was unnecessary.

----
CCOUNT10.LBR - ZCPR3
   Counts characters in text files.  Reports both the total number 
   of characters and counts for characters specified on the command 
   line.  Optionally, CCOUNT can report individual counts for all 
   characters, including control characters, and can ignore high 
   bits or not.  Counting is done via 32-bit integers.  Both ZCPR3 
   and vanilla CP/M are supported.
   
----
ZCNFG23.LBR - ZSIG
   ZCNFG is the Z-system COM file configuration utility, compatible
   with CP/M. Version 2.3 fixes a bug that caused an extraneous disk
   access (and BDOS error if no disk there), and restores CP/M
   compatibility that was inadvertantly compromised in V 2.1. Those
   interested in just *USING* ZCNFG need only extract ZCNFG.CZM and
   ZCNFG23.CFG. The included support LBRs are the same as those in
   the previous release, ZCNFG22 - Al Hawley 02/10/92

CLKMNT11.LBR - GENERAL CP/M
   Are you tired of having to manually change the year on your
   Kenmore clock every January 1st, or fix the day-of-the-week
   after the 29th of February?  CLOCKMNT eliminates both these
   annoyances.  All you have to do is run it when you start up your
   system, or just after midnight each day on your BBS.  The base
   address of the clock may be changed as required.  Version 1.1
   runs independently of DOS.  See CLOCKMNT.Z80 for details.

SUB35.LBR - ZCPR3
   The ZCPR3 disk-based batch command processor now obeys the Z33+
   SUBECHO option bit as well as the environment quiet flag.  The
   UNIX-style "$*" command tail parameter from ALIAS has been
   implemented, and SUB will optionally search a user-patched or
   command line specified library for the SUB file.  A Z34ERR12-
   compliant error handler interface has been added and the code
   compacted via Z80 opcodes and the establishment of a modest DSEG.

----
JTHLIB12.LBR - ZCPR3
   The custom routines in JTHLIB were originally developed for use in 
   REMIND and ZP.  They fill somewhat special purpose needs by doing 
   things slightly differently than the corresponding standard library 
   routines or by providing new services that I found useful and worth 
   sharing.  Vers 1.2 fixes a bug in FNAMZ and adds extended versions 
   of VLIB routines GXYMSG, VPRINT and VPSTR.  See JTHLIB12.HLP.

----
HELPLZH.LBR - ZCPR3
   This library contains new versions of the Z-System help programs that
   work with LZH encoded help files, (HYP extension), instead of
   crunched or squeezed files.  HELPCH.COM handles standalone files and
   LHH.COM deals with help files in libraries.  Although these programs
   take longer to load files than do their uncrunching counterparts,
   they can handle much larger files because the LZH decompression
   algorithm uses less memory. -- Howard Goldstein

----
ZF10Q.LBR - ZCPR3
   Next step in the development of ZFILER!  This one can remember
   the files that are hard and soft tagged across macro and group

   ENVCFG is used with ZCNFG and ENVCFG.CFG to configure the current 
   contents of the Z3CPR environment, such as the valid drive vector, 
   max drive, etc.  It works by loading a copy of the environment into 
   a buffer in ENVCFG.COM.  ZCNFG.COM and ENVCFG.CFG are then used to 
   configure ENVCFG.COM's Z3ENV buffer contents.  ENVCFG can then 
   write the modified Z3ENV buffer back to the environment, and the 
   new system can then be NZBLITZ'd if desired.  See ENVCFG.NEW/HZP.

SWZ10.LBR - ZCPR3
   This is a replacement for SWX and SWTIME if you run ZSDOS on your 
   SB180.  SWZ reads a SmartWatch chip and sets the system 
   "heartbeat" clock via ZSDOS.  It works under both the Micromint 
   BIOS and XBIOS.  In addition, SWZ will display the SmartWatch 
   time once or continuously, and optionally allows setting the time 
   on Wyse and TeleVideo terminals as it sets the system clock.

   crunched or squeezed files - whether standalone or in a .LBR.  If 
   wheel is on, can also easily extract any/all files, and uncrunch 
   and/or unsqueeze at the same time.  Most useful program for 
   either RCP/M use or for individual CP/M systems.
   
----
TLZH20.LBR - GENERAL CP/M
   TYPELZH version 2.0 incorporates the ability to handle files
   encoded with LZH algorithm version 2.0 (July '91).  Treats
   files with the extension .?Y? as LZH encoded, and 
   treats files with the extentions .?Z?  and .?Q? as CRUNCHED and 
   SQueezed.  Everything else should be the same.  TLZH20.COM is for 
   local use TLZH20R.COM is for RCP/Ms with wheel at 03EH.

CRLZH20.LBR - GENERAL CP/M
   Version 2.0 of CRLZH and UNCRLZH programs for CP/M.   Compresses 
   further and is faster than 1.x.  UNCRLZH will decode BOTH versions 
   of LZH-encoded files as well as CRUNCHed and SQueezed files.  
   Includes CRUNCH program changes thru v2.8.  Library contains .COMs, 
   source for the drivers, .REL files for the LZH code (for porting to 
   other programs), new .DOCs and updated CRUNCH docs.  Z80 only.  
   There are separate LT and FCRUNCH updates for 8080s, though.

----
ARC20COM.ARC - GENERAL CP/M
   This is Tilmann Reh's ARC20 compiled to run in a typical 58K (DOS
   entry at D406h) CP/M or Z-System.  ARC20 is somewhat more space
   efficient in its compression operations than the smaller/faster
   ARK11, but it supports only CPM+ time/date and lacks even
   rudimentary DU: response.  Although it is the first combination
   ARC/UNARC program available for CP/M, it should be noted that
   ARC20 is quite a bit larger than ARK11 and UNARC16 combined.

----
DU35.LBR - Z-SYSTEM
   This code is nearly identical to Gorm Helt-Hansen's DU34. Library
   routine names were restored to their full length so that the code will
   work with assemblers other than M80. The most significant change has
   been the addition of the patch code DU-CPM.Z80 which, when installed
   for a particular system configuration, inserts an internal ENV and
   TCAP to allow DU to operate under standard CP/M as well as Z-System.

----
ARC20.ARC - GENERAL CP/M
   ARC is a universal file archive program. ARC 2.0 will handle SEA and
   PK compatible ARChive files (except for "squashing" used by PK). It
   will pack and unpack ARChives, selecting the compression method with
   best ratio when putting files into an ARChive. Version 2.0 also
   supports CP/M-3-like date&time stamping (but may also be run under
   CP/M 2.2). And, ARC 2.0 is probably the fastest ARChive program in the
   CP/M world.  A large TPA is required for this program to run.

----
MAKE.ARC - GENERAL CP/M
   MAKE is a powerful utility for CP/M-3. MAKE is compatible with
   Microsoft's MAKE utility for the IBM PC. It allows for conditional
   execution of commands depending on date&time stamps of the files
   concerned. It recognizes the CP/M-3 Error Flag and stops when that
   flag is set. It also uses the CP/M-3 Drive Search Chain to search for
   source files.

----
PIPRSX.ARC - CP/M-PLUS
   PIPRSX is an extension for CP/M-3 PIP. When attached to PIP via
   GENCOM, it enables PIP to copy files with their byte count value and
   their archive attribute. It also copies the update date&time stamp to
   the destination, where it becomes the create and update date&time
   stamps. However, this won't work with interrupt-driven real time
   clocks. Last but not least, you may now use DU: specification with
   every filename you enter.

PZMACS.MAT - GENERAL CP/M
   Contains in executable code all of the macros from the first four 
   PMATE/ZMATE MACROS  columns in TCJ.
   
----
ZDATESET.LBR - ZSDOS/ZDDOS/Z80DOS
   Dbase II CMD file to read a clock via the ZSDOS function 
   98 and set the Dbase DATE(). Uses an assembly language 
   routine to accomplish this. Make this the first CMD requested
   in your program or incorporate it into your main CMD file.
   The DBASE date setting routine is skipped when you do
   'DBASE PROGRAM' so ZDBDATE will not work to set the date
   in this circumstance.   Biff Bueffel 07/07/91

NAME12.LBR - ZCPR3
   Minor update of the quick ZCPR3 directory name changer.  The
   help message has been enhanced and a Type 4 version has been
   implemented.  Still well under 2K and the easiest-to-use tool
   for NDR manipulation.  Use with SAVNDR and a system loader
   (JetLdr, NZCOM, LLDR, LDR, etc.) or with a "system snapshot"
   utility (SNAP, LAP, NZBLITZ, etc.) to make changes permanent.
   Version 1.2 is recoded to work with the new, bugs-fixed Z3LIB.

ZDBDAT11.LBR - ZSDOS/ZDDOS/Z80DOS
   Overlay for dBase II versions 2.41 and 2.43* that will load the 
   date into dBase using the ZSDOS GET-TIME function.  If the clock 
   is not functioning, the routine will default to the standard 
   dBase date routine.  Version 1.1 corrects a problem when used 
   with NEWBASE.
   
----
NEWBAS12.LBR - GENERAL CP/M
   dBase II overlay options allow skipping date question and sign- 
   on, add INKEY function, permit loading overlay files from an 
   alternate drive, and several other mods.  Under Z-system or CP/M- 
   Plus, dBase can be called from any drive on your system.  Version 
   1.2 fixes several bugs and adds a few improvements.  Now in Zilog 
   mnemonics.

MXC-ZS10.ZZ0 - MODEM/MEX/TERM3
   A hardware-independent clock overlay for MEX-Plus, which should work
   on any machine running ZSDOS with a clock installed.  The CSET
   command is implemented and it allows very flexible setting of the
   system clock from within MEX.  Any single element of the time and
   date (the seconds, for instance) can be adjusted without touching
   anything else.
   
----
MXO-FX15.1Z0 - MODEM/MEX/TERM3
   I've been tweeking this MEX-Plus overlay for the SB180FX for a couple
   of years now, so I think it's about time I released an update.  This
   is for Hayes-compatible smart modems.  Both the SET and SSET commands
   are implemented.  Disconnect uses DTR.  Modem is initialized just
   before dialing so you can leave MEX and return without causeing any
   untoward line events.  Modem speed is stored in Page 0 and retrieved
   on re-entry.

   COM file that runs under vanilla CP/M, Type-3 (loading at 8000h), 
   and Type-4 versions.  How can you pass this up?
   
----
SAVE16.LBR - ZCPR33+ Specific
   Transient SAVE command for use with ZCPR34/NZCOM.  The library
   contains type-3 and type-4 executables as well as Z80 source code.
   The only difference between this version and version 1.5 is that the
   code has been shortened.  Now even the type-4 version will fit in
   one 2k block on disk.

   ACREATE and BA24, but supports assembler-style comments and 
   multiple newlines in the source file, has Joe Wright's latest 
   ALIAS0 built-in rather than using a separate "alias template" 
   file, allows VALIAS-style "recursive" aliases, and has Program 
   Error Flag support for automation of alias "development."

----
CL10.LBR - GENERAL CP/M
   CL is a highly enhanced version of a utility created by Michal 
   Carson in early 1989.  Its main function is to "compact" an LBR 
   file, that is, to eliminate the "dead space" caused by member 
   files marked as "deleted."  CL performs this task without the 
   disk space appetite of LU's "-R" or NULU's "-K," and is itself 
   only 4K in length.  It can also erase members from the LBR, lists 
   and wildcards allowed. For CP/M 2.2, with runtime ZCPR3 support.

----
LREPAIR.LBR - ZCPR3
   LREPAIR is an LBR file integrity tester with limited correction 
   capabilities.  It reports the CRC of all or the selected member 
   files to the CRT, along with whether its findings agree with the 
   values stored in the LBR directory.  If the stored CRC is 0000h 
   and the member file isn't empty (as is the case for LBRs written 
   to by LBRDISK or old versions of LU and NULU), it will fix the 
   CRC, as well as strip any high bits in member filename entries.

----
OE17.LBR - ZCPR3
   A ZCPR3 utility that prints the odd- or even-numbered pages of 
   NewWord and WordStar files for two-sided documents.  Accepts a 
   list of files and sets the program error flag on error.  Version 
   1.7 handles both Epson FX and LQ printer drivers.  Although not 
   tested, OE should also work with MX and RX drivers.

CRUNCH28.LBR - ZCPR3
   File compression and decompression tools for ZCPR3 and CP/M.  
   UNCR works on crunched, squeezed, and LZH files.  Under ZSDOS 
   date stamps are embedded in crunched file and restored when 
   uncrunched.  Can exclude system files.  Handles up to 512 
   matching files.  ZCNFG configuration.  PCP support.  More compact 
   displays.  Version 2.8 fixes a couple of bugs and includes 
   smaller ZCPR3-only versions.

ZTYPE11.LBR - GENERAL CP/M
   Text file display utility for ".ZIP" files.  .ZIP files are libraries
   of compressed subfiles created with Phil Katz's PKZIP file archiving
   program for MSDOS.  Ztype allows CP/M users to view the contents of
   such files without first extracting them.  ZTYPE works with all CP/M
   2.2, 3.0, and compatible systems having at least 45.5k of TPA.
   BDS C source included.  Version 1.1 corrects a bug which caused ZTYPE
   to fail under certain conditions (see ZT.C).  04/27/91 by Carson W.

----
RS232TS2 - ZCPR33+ Specific
   RS232TST reads the status byte from an RS232 control port and places 
   it in ZCPR3 user register 8.  Registers 0 through 7 contain either 1 
   or 0, depending on bits of the status byte.  Optional wheel protec- 
   tion and I/O port selection are set by patching well marked bytes in 
   the first sector of the program.  If RS232TST is wheel protected and 
   if the wheel byte is reset, RS232TST returns an error code 6, making 
   it effectively invisible to non-wheels.

   Version 1.4 is faster on hard disks under ZSDOS and ZRDOS.
   Not for Z3PLUS.
   
----
CMD14.LBR - ZCPR3
   Version 1.4 of CMD introduces a major change in prompted 
   operation -- CMD now reinvokes itself after each command until an 
   empty command line (a RETURN alone) or a Control-C is entered. 
   Control-C also exits the current shell (if any) as in Version 
   1.3.  In this way, CMD can act like an MS-DOS or UNIX "secondary 
   shell" invocation for true Z-System shells as well as for "ZCPR2-
   style" shells like MEX with MEX2Z or Sage-modified WS4.

   softens a hard-carriaged paragraph *AND* then reformats the 
   paragraph.  SAMPKEY had a Soften key, but it did not reformat the 
   file -- you had to use another macro key to reformat the file.  
   For ZDE, install with the command ZDENSTAL ZDE ZDEMACRO.ZDK.

Z3BAS.LBR - ZCPR3
   Z3BAS.LIB - a collection of routines written in MBASIC which 
   may be used in MBASIC programs to access Z-System 
   environment data. Currently, Z3 environment address 
   calculation, tcap string building, cursor motion macro 
   interpreter, quiet and wheel byte etc. status implemented.  
   By using BASCOM and L80 and a tiny Z3HDR.REL file, MBASIC 
   programs can become Z3 utilities. Lee Bradley, 06/20/90.

MDU11.LBR - ZCPR3
   A tiny ZCPR3 utility to set or display the maximum drive and user 
   (MAXDU) in the environment descriptor.  It was written to test 
   software and to allow reconfiguration of my drive system without 
   creating a new ENV file.  It might also be useful for RCP/M's.  
   MDU.CIM is a type 3 version that loads at 8000h.  Version 1.1 
   fixes a bug and adds wheel byte support.
   
----
CRCZ11.LBR - ZCPR3
   CRCZ calculates the cyclic-redundancy checksum (CRC) for a group 
   of files, displaying the checksums on the screen, typing them to 
   the printer, and/or writing them to a file.  In validation mode, 
   CRCZ reads a checksum file and matches the listed CRC values to 
   files on the disk.  For ZCPR3 only.  Version 1.1 corrects a bug 
   or two and adds remote system security features.

   EXL is a program that will type or print squeezed (.?Q?) crunched (.?
   or LZH compressed (.?Y?) files. It will also uncompress these to a di
   file. In addition, it will do this directly out of a .LBR file, so it
   possible to type a LZH compressed file that is inside a .LBR, or prin
   it, or extract it to disk. It also has full user area support: users
   0 through 31 can be accessed.    Hint - try 'A>EXL EXL EXL.DYC'
   
----

   Proportional Formatting, Auto-Recall of last response to prompts, 
   Global Find/Replace, Return to Previous Position (^QP) and more to 
   what many felt was already the best editor available for CP/M.

   It creates a PCP.TIM file that is cummulative! You need to have the 
   PCPIMP7 LBR for the support files. You overlay it with *your* IMP 
   overlay and your Custom.Asm. With ZCPR use MEX2Z or IMP2Z to 'shell' 
   out to PCP8 to disconnect/recall with PCP.

   the CBIOS in NZCOM systems to the logical limits - IX, IY, AF', BC',
   DE', and HL' are now protected on ALL CBIOS calls.  This NZCOM BIO
   replacement is a must for ZSDOS on any system that uses IX and IY
   in BIOS and will probably cure some strange ills on other systems
   (whose BIOS authors must have thought everybody runs all 8080 code!).

PPIP19.LBR - ZCPR3
   Modified to interface with the ZCPR3 error handler.  A user abort

   the Z3 libraries and the Z3LIB PUTER2 routine but it didn't work for 
   me.  The user therefore has to hard-code the address of his error 
   flag; an equate or patch points are provided.  Assistance welcomed

ZCPR33A.LBR - ZCPR33 Specific
   Dreas Nielsen has modified the ZCPR33 command processor to allow for 
   the processing of flow control within custom shells, such as a SHSET 
   command line.  Since I am a frequent user of SHSET, I have always 
   felt frustrated at the prohibition against running an alias in a 
   SHSET command line if that alias contains flow control.  Much of this
   mod consist simply of commenting out code in there that prohibits 
   it.  I aim to install this tonight.    - Rick Charnes, 7/6/88

   an alias or other script to implement a distributed Z-System
   from the "local" computer rather than "remote."A script line
   can execute a command on the "remote" and return to the
   preferred "local" interface (command line or shell), leaving

   Morrow Owners Review (R.I.P.).  I LOVED writing these, and the Morrow
   ZCPR3 community that they helped engender has been a source of great 
   joy to me. BBS's are our historical archives.  When the archeologists
   come, I want these to be there.  Please use LDIR-B to first look at 
   this library; uncrunch members w/UNCR23D if possible. - Rick Charnes

ZARTICLS.LBR - ZCPR3
   This library contains 3 reviews I wrote for the Morrow Owners Review:
   Backgrounder II, DateStamper, and the Mini-Winnie hard disk/ZCPR3 
   combination.  Also includes an article I wrote upon my tender first 
   explorations into the ZCPR3 world which eventually got published in 
   FOGHORN (!).  I want these entered into our communal archives (our 
   BBSs) before I get too old.  Use LDIR-B to first look this library, 
   and uncrunch members with UNCR23D if available.   - Rick Charnes

ZRDPUB10.LBR - ZCPR3/3/Z-System
   The purpose of this code is to kludge up a solution to the problem

   It has been tested with ZCPR 3.3 and ZRDOS 1.7. It may or may not
   work with other versions of this o/s, though judging by my ZRDOS docs
   it should work with versions that go as far back as 1.2 (first public
   ZRDOS?), and I see no good reason why it shouldn't work with other
   versions of ZCPR.           Al Grabauskas   01/20/88

Z33VER10.LBR - ZCPR33 Specific
   ***** SCREEN ORIENTED ERROR HANDLER FOR ZCPR33 *****
   This version fixes a bug which caused the screen to be cleared
   whenever the program was invoked. I also now make Z33VERR look
   at the quiet flag before printing it's install message. There is
   also a new command line option 'S' which will inhibit the initial
   screen clear when a error is detected. Also added aliases:
   <CR> for 'E'dit, <ESC> for 'A'bort, & <SP> for 'C'ontinue.

----
Z33ANOTE.001 - ZCPR33 Specific
   This is the first in a series of application notes for ZCPR33.  This

   This application provides some technical information on the operation
   of the ZCPR33 file specification parser.  It describes the use of the
   two external entry points to the CPR code, and it indicates how the
   data in the file control blocks can be used to determine information
   about the file specification (for example, did it include an explicit
   directory, was the specified directory a valid one).  New information
   provided in the external command FCB is covered also.

   deal with situations where the shell is invoked when (1) additional
   commands are pending in the command line buffer or (2) ZEX and/or
   SUBMIT jobs are running.                  Jay Sage,  June 8, 1987

   This is the first of a series of ZCPR33 programming notes, information
   of importance to people who are writing programs that take advantage
   of the new features offered by ZCPR33.  This one deals with the new bits
   that are defined in the command status flag byte in the message buffer.
   It also covers an error in the QERROR routine in Z3LIB that did not
   cause any trouble in ZCPR30, when only two bits were used in the flag,
   but which now must be corrected.           Jay Sage,  June 8, 1987

   longer mandatory before restoring the disk.  Both versions may be 
   patched to automatically reset the drive to log in the new directory 
   if running under ZRDOS 1.5 or later, and user patching is easier.

CMDPATCH.LBR - ZCPR3
   A patch file that makes two changes to CMD version 1.0.  The simple

   bit in the command status flag in the Z3 message buffer so that an
   error handler can take care of any bad command entered (shell errors
   always abort, flushing the command and entire shell stack).

   up ...  A VFILER.CMD used to exhibit a technique by which one can
   activate the graphics mode of one's terminal so that one's menu
   display becomes surrounded by a beautiful, unbroken-line BOX.  Quite

   aliases, an ALIAS.CMD and a ZEX file I've developed to keep orderly
   the backing up of hard disk directories that require more than one
   backup floppy.  Premised on the idea of grouping floppy backups
   alphabetically, manipulating AC.COM for this purpose.  Extensive and

HSHBGPAT.ZZ0 - BACKGROUNDER
   This is a more elaborate patch for HSH version 1.5.  It not only
   protects against the 'GO' command but interacts with DateStamper and

      1) show the time in the prompt if DateStamper is active;
      2) give a '[BGii Active]' message if BGii is running; and
      3) give a lower case prompt for the lower case task of BGii
   This patch has been tested only on my system.    Jay Sage, 01/07/87

HISTORY.LBR - GENERAL CP/M
   Implements command line editing and history/recall as an extended
   BDOS function, trading off TPA for speed and disk space compared to

SETIOP.LBR - ZCPR3
   A ZCPR3 system utility for those who don't want to put IOP 
   intercept code in their BIOS. SETIOP installs the intercept vectors
   after LDR has loaded the IOP into place. Until the vectors are
   installed, the BIOS uses its own I/O routines and makes NO reference
   to the IOP. Saves space in BIOS, and may be necessary for those
   who can't modify their BIOS. Contains a standard DUMMY IOP with
   discussion of the principles.

MXO-BW13.ASM
   This is the latest MEX overlay for the Bondwell 2, downloaded from
   the Compuserve CPMSIG on 2/17/86.  It supports the 300-baud internal
   modem, and will probably work with the internal 1200-baud modem, as
   the national Bondwell service director, Jon Bek, says they share the 
   same command structure.  The overlay is compatible with (but does not
   include) the Smartmodem overlay MXO-SMxx.ASM.  MXO-BW13.ASM defaults 
   to internal modem, 300 baud, and features an expanded SET command.

----
MXO-LB11.AQM
   This is my version of an overlay for MEX for the Ampro Little Board

   original GOODBYE routine that failed to reassert the DTR line after
   it was dropped to force a disconnect.  If DTR never came back on, one

   HD64180 mnemonics.  Source code is omitted to save space.  SB180
   owners should be sure to get at least DASMHIT.COM for Hitachi chip
   disassemblies.

FU-12.LBR
   A HEX/ASCII file editor adoog the lines of EDFILE and PATCH.  Written
   in TURBO.
   
------------------------------
DEBUGRCP.AQM
   There have been a number of requests for this RCP that gives you
   a memory resident MU3 (the memory utility for Z3 that reads what you
   have in memory).  You asked for it and you got it.
   
------------------------------
ACMDU11.LBR
   Version 1.1 of ACMDUTIL.  ACMDUTIL allows you to add, delete and view
   aliases in an ALIAS.CMD file without a word processor.  ACMDUTIL was
   written for those of us who write aliases on the fly.  Version 1.1
   now searches BASE: rather than ROOT: for the ALIAS.CMD file and takes
   an optional DU: on the command line to find any copy of ALIAS.CMD.

LFIND.LBR
   A very nice (fast!) utility for uncovering files buried within LBRs
   by NULU author Martin Murray .
   
----
ANNOUNCE.180
   At the behest and with the encouragement of Steve Ciarcia, writer
   and editor Bruce Morgen (with an assist from sysop Richard Jacobson)
   has formed the first and only SB180 user's group, The North American
   One-Eighty Group.  Get in on the ground floor with a pre-announcement
   special offer that includes a discount on a subscription to Lillipute
   Z-Node!

WS33.DQC
   WS33.DOC is a document listing the known patch locations for
   WordStar v3.3 for CP/M-80.
   
----
WS30.DQC
   WS30.DOC is a document listing the known patch locations for
   WordStar v3.0 for CP/M-80.
   
----
WS-ATOWS.LBR
   yet another program to convert ascii files to wordstar document
   mode.  The .com file is for z-80 cp/m and the source is in C.
   
----
VALIAS11.LBR
   This is version 1.1 of VALIAS.  The only change is a small bug fix.
   Version 1.0 would not log into the correct user area when a file name
   was included on the command line (the default user would always be
   used).  The READ.ME file explains the simple change (so you don't
   need to download the source again).    Jay Sage
   
----
LUZ3.LBR
   Latest ZCPR3-only LBR file tools from Rick Conn.  Very slick stuff!
   
----
INSPECT.LBR
   This allows a user to "look at" a file and gives various info
   about it - both for novice users and more advanced.
   
----
WDSTRLS2.LBR
   update to wrdstrls -- converts single-spaced wordstar files to
   double/triple space.  for z-80 cp/m
   
----
Q.OBJ
   This very simple program shows the state of page 0 of memory after a
   command is issued.  Enter "Q TAIL" and one can see how the first two
   tokens are parsed into the default file control blocks and how the
   tail is stored in the buffer at 80H.  This is useful for program
   developers.  With ZCPR3 you can see how user numbers are stored when
   DU and DIR forms are parsed.

TPATCH2.Z80 IN TURBOPAT.LBR
   This patch for Turbo Pascal version 3 makes it skip the question
   about including error messages.  Depending on an equate in the patch,
   the answer will default to yes or no.  This speeds up operation.
   
----
TPATCH1.Z80 IN TURBOPAT.LBR
   This is a patch for Turbo Pascal version 3 that makes it look for its
   error message overlay in a specified user area instead of in the
   current user area.  This makes Turbo much more useful in a ZCPR3
   environment.
