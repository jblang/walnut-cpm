9AT05D.LBR       52224  06-08-93  Schedules commands (programs) for automatic	AT05D.LBR
                               | execution at a specified future date/time or
                               | repeated frequency. Implemented as a standard
                               | RSX plus a loader which contains the database
                               | of commands to be scheduled. By Bridger
                               | Mitchell, updated 11/92 by Howard Goldstein.
                               | Requirements: Z-System (NZ-COM, Z3PLUS, or
                               | ZCPR3.x) with extended external environment,
                               | real-time clock, and DateStamper,
                               | ZSDOS/ZDDOS, or CP/M Plus.
9BCOMP30B.LBR    31488  06-08-93  Interactive binary file comparison and	BCOMP30B.LBR
                               | patching tool. Requires ZCPR 3.0 or Z3PLUS.
                               | Fixes two bugs discivered in version 3.0a.
9BIGDIR12.LBR    24192  06-08-93  This Z-system utility displays the contents	BIGDIR12.LBR
                               | of all Directories named in the current NDR
                               | with or without paging. Version 1.2 adds
                               | interactive display speed and paging control.
                               | New command line options allow selection of
                               | directory sort order, inclusion of system
                               | files, of 0 length files, and of passworded
                               | directories. The last three are wheel
                               | restricted, making BIGDIR suitable for use on
                               | a BBS. All functions are configurable with
                               | ZCNFG.
9BUIHD09.LBR     68736  06-08-93  BUIHD = BUIld Help Document. This program	BUIHD09.LBR
                               | from Holland will take a hierarchical set of
                               | HLP files and build a WordStar document
                               | complete with table of contents and index.
                               | This is a test version. The author wants
                               | feedback. Jay Sage
9CD39.LBR        15872  06-08-93  Carson Wilson's last update to the ZCPR3	CD39.LBR
                               | Change Directory program. Most people will
                               | not have any use for this utility, but it has
                               | some special applications that might be of
                               | interest to some people.
9CFORZ02.LBR     51328  06-08-93  This is a collection of toolbox routines for	CFORZ02.LBR
                               | BDS-Z, all with a Z-System emphasis. An
                               | expanded version of CVLIB is included as well
                               | as ENV access and manipulation routines,
                               | ZS/ZDDOS stamp and time/date access, du and
                               | ndr support routines, shell and MCL
                               | manipulation, and more! 100+ new functions at
                               | last count. Just add BDS-Z C Compiler, some
                               | glue code and a bit of imagination, and
                               | create Z utilities!
9CL10.LBR        25344  06-08-93  CL is a highly enhanced version of a utility	CL10.LBR
                               | created by Michal Carson in early 1989. Its
                               | main function is to "compact" an LBR file,
                               | that is, to eliminate the "dead space" caused
                               | by member files marked as "deleted." CL
                               | performs this task without the disk space
                               | appetite of LU's "-R" or NULU's "-K," and is
                               | itself only 4K in length. It can also erase
                               | members from the LBR, lists and wildcards
                               | allowed. For CP/M 2.2, with runtime ZCPR3
                               | support.
9CMAZE25.LBR     42752  06-08-93  CMAZE is a game. You control a moving	CMAZE25.LBR
                               | "billiard ball" with the numeric keypad keys.
                               | Your score increases each time you hit a $.
                               | Randomness and statistics display are
                               | adjustable. See CMAZE.NOT for details. CMAZE
                               | is Z-System aware. This release fixes a
                               | graphics bug and a delay loop bug. - Lee
                               | Bradley 3/2/93
9D23.LBR         41728  06-08-93  Z-System directory program, under 4K, with	D23.LBR
                               | many unique features: lower-case display,
                               | number of remaining directory entries, and
                               | many options. Also sets error flag for no
                               | matching files and can store number of
                               | matching files in registers. Version 2.3 adds
                               | new option for summary only and fixes long
                               | standing bug. Runs under vanilla CP/M.
9DATSTP19.LBR    62080  06-08-93  How often have you wanted to change a file's	DATSTP19.LBR
                               | date stamps? Well, here's the answer: DATSTP
                               | displays or changes ZSDOS, Z3PLUS, and
                               | DateStamper create and modify date stamps
                               | from the command line, with very flexible
                               | syntax. Type 3 (@ 100h, 8000h) and 4 versions
                               | included, type and load address now shown in
                               | the program banner. Version 1.9 replaces VLIB
                               | with much shorter ZSLIB34 routines. This
                               | results in even big DATSTPU.4OM coming in at
                               | a modest 6K.
9DD20.LBR        36096  06-08-93  ZCPR3 disk directory utility with several	DD20.LBR
                               | command line options, including the option to
                               | display only those specified files which also
                               | have a selected combination of the file
                               | attributes F1-F8 set. Can display only non-
                               | archived (changed) files as an aid in file
                               | backup and can send directory to the printer.
                               | Now displays correct disk free space under
                               | banked ZSDOS2, old large file filesize bug
                               | fixed. Companion to ACOPY, RENAMZ, ERAZ and
                               | UNERAZ. See DD20.HZP. U/L by Terry Hazen,
                               | 09/13/92
9DU35.LBR        63232  06-08-93  This code is nearly identical to Gorm Helt	DU35.LBR
                               | Hansen's DU34. Library routine names were
                               | restored to their full length so that the
                               | code will work with assemblers other than
                               | M80. The most significant change has been the
                               | a addition of the patch code DU CPM.Z80
                               | which, when installed for a particular system
                               | configuration, inserts an internal ENV and
                               | TCAP to allow DU to operate under standard
                               | CP/M as well as Z-System.
9DU90.LBR        64000  06-08-93  DU v. 9.0 is a further development of Ward	DU90.LBR
                               | Christensen's DU program. This version is
                               | specific to CP/M+ and takes advantage of this
                               | to therefore be repeated by the use of Ctrl-
                               | W. A 'Handler' module has been added to take
                               | care of buffering from 128 byte sectors to
                               | physical sector sizes, so that disk access is
                               | reduced. The disk mapping routine has been
                               | substantially revised, and the 'K' function
                               | now has the option to add to existing files.
9EDZCM10.LBR     34176  06-08-93  Edits NZCOM ZCM file or one created by	EDZCM10.LBR
                               | program reading the Z3ENV. See EDZCM.HLP.
9ENVCFG11.LBR    19328  06-08-93  ENVCFG is used with ZCNFG and ENVCFG.CFG to	ENVCFG11.LBR
                               | configure the current contents of the Z3CPR
                               | environment, such as the valid drive vector,
                               | max drive, etc. It works by loading a copy of
                               | the environment into a buffer in ENVCFG.COM.
                               | ZCNFG.COM and ENVCFG.CFG are then used to
                               | configure ENVCFG.COM's Z3ENV buffer contents.
                               | ENVCFG can then write the modified Z3ENV
                               | buffer back to the environment, and the new
                               | system can then be NZBLITZ'd if desired. See
                               | ENVCFG.NEW/HZP.
9ENVSRC13.LBR    13440  06-08-93  Generates a commented source code file	ENVSRC13.LBR
                               | (Z3ENV.Z80) from the ZCPR3 environment using
                               | the latest extended environment definitions.
                               | The resulting source code file can be used as
                               | a reference for patching or it can be edited
                               | to customize elements in your ZCPR3
                               | environment, then assembled and loaded to
                               | your environment or your boot system image.
                               | Companion to TCSRC. V1.3 adds B/P BIOS user
                               | space definitions. See ENVSRC13.HZP.
9EOF11.LBR        7424  06-08-93  EOF, Version 1.1 by Bruce Morgan, May 22,	EOF11.LBR
                               | 1992, originally written by Rob Freifeld,
                               | March 25, 1991. Programmer's tool. Displays
                               | only the end records of files along with a
                               | report of the file size in records and
                               | kbytes, and how many records of the last
                               | kbyte are filled. For ZCPR and CP/M. Patch
                               | data word at 110H is default offset for
                               | address display. This version is quite a bit
                               | smaller and auto-offsets Z33+ type 3
                               | executables.
9ERADIR10.LBR    10368  06-08-93  ERADIR completely erases a directory.	ERADIR10.LBR
                               | Especially useful on a hardisk, where it can
                               | erase the directory of one drive while
                               | leaving the others intact. Use in conjunction
                               | with Gene Pizzetta's CHKDIR if it reports
                               | serious problems on a drive. Back up first,
                               | of course, and use this powerful program with
                               | care.
9FA16A.LBR       38656  06-08-93  An update and bug-fix of FILEATTR (FA), a	FA16A.LBR
                               | ZSDOS utility that allows rapid setting,
                               | resetting, or displaying of file attributes
                               | under ZSDOS, ZRDOS, and CP/M 2.2. Several
                               | additional features are available under
                               | ZCPR3, including error flag setting, error
                               | handler invocation, and an enhanced display.
                               | Version 1.6A adds documentation; otherwise,
                               | same as 1.6.
9FD22.CZM         4224  06-08-93  This updated version of Filedate 2.2 was	FD22.CZM
                               | accidently left out of ZDOS10UP.LBR and
                               | posted by Cameron Cotrill on Ladera. Those
                               | who download that library will also want to
                               | pick this up.
9FF24.LBR        74624  06-08-93  FF (Find File) version 2.4 adds several new	FF24.LBR
                               | options, and makes all options configurable
                               | with ZCNFG. Uses SYSLIB4C routines, including
                               | the sort routines to make FF noticeably
                               | faster. Source code revised for brevity,
                               | clarity, and code optimization. Command line
                               | syntax relaxed. Still compatible with Z3PLUS
                               | and DosDisk. Al Hawley, 01/26/91

9HELPC15.LBR     24576  06-08-93  HELPC is a replacement for the standard Z	HELPC15.LBR
                               | System HELP utility. It handles crunched as
                               | well as normal, uncompressed help files and
                               | is particularly well suited for use on remote
                               | systems since the screen print options are
                               | disabled when the wheel byte is turned off.
                               | Version 1.5 has an improved file lookup
                               | routine that skips over compressed files that
                               | the program can't handle. Also, better

                               | handles standalone files and LHH.COM deals
                               | with help files in libraries. Although these
                               | programs take longer to load files than do
                               | their uncrunching counterparts, they can
                               | handle much larger files because the LZH

9KEYIN14.LBR     19712  06-08-93  KEYBIOS is a special NZCOM virtual BIOS that	KEYIN14.LBR
                               | implements a keyboard buffer that, having
                               | been filled by the utility KEYIN, can provide

                               | next. KEYIN 1.3 is more space-efficient and
                               | supports KEYINIOP.ZRL, which even works on
                               | non-NZCOM Z-Systems. KEYIN 1.4 fixes a stack
                               | problem and a problem involving the prtname

                               | would be interested. This ZCPR utility erases
                               | BAK, HEX, REL, PRN, and SYM files. The types
                               | of files it erases can be easily modified. It
                               | defaults to ALL files of the above types, but
                               | a filename can be given, to erase just those
                               | filetypes for your current project. It now

9XRUN25.LBR      38656  06-08-93  XRUN is an Extended Command Processor (ECP)	XRUN25.LBR
                               | for ZCPR 3.3. It looks for files along the
                               | search path and constructs a command line
                               | depending on the extension of the file found.
                               | In case no matching file is found, a default
                               | command line can be set to start another ECP.

                               | descriptor) to make an extended TCAP with
                               | enough features to run the ZMATE text editor
                               | and the V file viewer (and possibly other
                               | programs). XTCAP works with the in-memory
                               | TCAP and will allow the new TCAP to be saved
                               | to a file for later use. Jay Sage, April 29,

9Z33IF16.LBR     39552  06-08-93  This version of the Z-System transient flow	Z33IF16.LBR
                               | control tool is functionally identical to the
                               | previous and excellent Version 1.5 except
                               | that the new ZSLIB's video highlighting calls
                               | are used instead of VLIB's much larger
                               | equivalents. This results in the preferred

9Z33TBUFF.LBR    23936  06-08-93  This is zcpr33 specific. An extension of	Z33TBUFF.LBR
                               | Cotrill's Z33trcp, it sets aside a RSX
                               | segemnt immediatly below the CCP large enough
                               | to hold those segments among the RCP, IOP,

                               | lie below the CCP. They are then protected
                               | from the warm boot routine. This allows a Z33
                               | user to do quite a bit of dynamic resizing of
                               | his system. Warning: I set aside space for
                               | the IOP, but do not load a skeletal one. If
                               | this causes grief, tell me; I will fix.
