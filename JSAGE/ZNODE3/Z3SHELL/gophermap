9CMDPATCH.LBR     2688  06-07-93  A patch file that makes two changes to CMD	CMDPATCH.LBR
                               | version 1.0. The simple part is the
                               | elimination of a superfluous space after the
                               | '>' in the command prompt. The more
                               | significant change is turning of the shell
                               | bit in the command status flag in the Z3
                               | message buffer so that an error handler can
                               | take care of any bad command entered (shell
                               | errors always abort, flushing the command and
                               | entire shell stack). Jay Sage, April 17, POKE

9EASE20T.LBR      5376  06-07-93  This file is an overlay for EASE20.Z80	EASE20T.LBR
                               | generated for use at 8000h (EASE8000.COM).
                               | It's main purpose is to display time in the
                               | command line prompt. It can get this time
                               | from one of two sources, either Z80DOS23+ or
                               | BYE510 for RCPM use. If BYE510 support is
                               | enabled, then if BYE is not found to be
                               | running, a check will be made to look for the
                               | time from Z80DOS. EASE20Z8.HEX for Z80DOS,
                               | EAS20BYZ.HEX for BYE.

9HSH15PAT.Z80      640  06-07-93  This is a very short, simple patch that can	HSH15PAT.Z80
                               | be applied to HSH15 to prevent any attempt to
                               | rerun it using the GO command. Similar
                               | patches should be applied to any programs
                               | that should not be reinvoked using GO.
                               | Install that patch immediately after the
                               | original code and have the patch continue at
                               | the destination of the original jump at 100h.

9LUSH12.LBR      23808  06-07-93  LUSH12 is a refinement/extension of LUSH10 by	LUSH12.LBR
                               | Carson Wilson, which was derived from John
                               | Poplett's ZLUX via Terry Carrol's ZLBR. It is
                               | a small, simple LUX-style LBR file access
                               | shell for modern Z-Systems, including ZCPR
                               | 3.3/3.4, NZCOM, Z3PLUS, and BGii 1.3x. LUSH
                               | now allows access to ARK/ARC, ZIP, and LZW
                               | files through use of external utilities. The
                               | internal DIR command and CCP-dependent
                               | parsing are now optional. Type 3 & 4
                               | executables.
9MENU42.LBR      45568  06-07-93  This revision of the original ZCPR3 menu	MENU42.LBR
                               | shell includes direct support for Bridger
                               | Mitchell's "AT" background timer and shrinks
                               | the venerable tool down to its 1984 fighting
                               | weight of 4K. All functions of the previous
                               | and apparently bug free version 4.1 remain
                               | as-is.

9PATVLU11.AZM     6272  06-07-93  Extension of Bob Schultz's patch to Carson's	PATVLU11.AZM
                               | VLU (which added an internal TCap to run
                               | under CP/M). This patch adds support for the
                               | reverse- as well as dim-video versions and
                               | enables library construction under CP/M (or
                               | ZCPR30).
9SHELLINI.LBR     2048  06-07-93  Good for ZCPR3 folks having shell-related	SHELLINI.LBR
                               | problems with WS4. Zeroes out the entire
                               | shell stack. Has solved a number of people's
                               | problems with it. -Rick Charnes

                               | bug fixes.
9TEX13.LBR       32256  06-07-93  an import from Australia, by Ron Murray, the	TEX13.LBR
                               | author of ZMP. A Shell that does timekeeping
                               | and scheduled execution. American v1.3 uses
                               | DSLIB and ZSLIB routine to work with both
                               | ZSDOS & Z80DOS.

                               | problem associated with creat-ion of library
                               | datestamps for January. Also allows a new

9W23.LBR         35840  06-07-93  A few changes to this excellent Steve Cohen	W23.LBR
                               | program that allows the use of wildcards with
                               | programs that don't accept ambiguous
                               | filenames. It now checks the ZCPR QUIET flag
                               | before displaying messages. The "scanning
                               | disk...wait" message can now be suppressed
                               | with a configuration byte. A Type 3 header
                               | has been added and a version is included that
                               | loads at 8000h.

9ZF-NZEX1.LBR     5632  06-07-93  This file contains some ZFiler macros and two	ZF-NZEX1.LBR
                               | NZEX scripts that extend the old PRINT.ZEX
                               | idea. Using three ZFiler macros, you can
                               | Print OR Mailmerge files directly from ZFiler
                               | using WS 3.3 either singly or in tagged
                               | groups. Open to customization (should be easy
                               | to port to newer or older WS's or to change
                               | print options), and contains a couple of neat
                               | general purpose tricks.
9ZF10Q.LBR      120192  06-07-93  Next step in the development of ZFILER! This	ZF10Q.LBR
                               | one can remember the files that are hard and
                               | soft tagged across macro and group macro
                               | invocations, so you can now use macros
                               | without losing the tagging information.
9ZLUX26.LBR      42496  06-07-93  Not ZSIG. Fort ZCPR 3.x (KMD is unforgiving).	ZLUX26.LBR
                               | Adds .ARKs and the ability to rebame ZLUX to
