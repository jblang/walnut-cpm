ZF11SRC.LBR - ZCPR3
   This is the source code to version 1.1 of ZFILER.  I hope that
   someone will complete and improve the CFG file and that someone
   will add code (with assembly option) for a version of ZFILER that
   acts as a ZCPR2-style shell (adding a command to reinvoke itself
   at the end of any other commands it pushed into the command line).

JTHLIB14.LBR - ZCPR3
   Custom routines originally developed for use in REMIND and ZP fill
   somewhat special purpose needs by doing things slightly differently

ZFIND15.LBR - ZCPR3
   ZCPR3 string search utility very quickly finds ASCII strings in text
   files using the Boyer-Moore string search algorithm.  Similar to Irv
   Hoff's FIND.COM, but MUCH faster.  Matched string can be displayed
   in either the line or the delimited block in which it was found and
   the output can be written or appended to a file.  Fast lookups in
   magazine article index or MAST.CAT files.  Fixed bug causing very
   large files to be searched more than once.  See ZFIND15.HZP.
