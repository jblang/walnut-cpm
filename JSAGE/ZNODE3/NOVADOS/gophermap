9NOVADOSI.LBR    94080  06-08-93  NovaDOS is a 100% compatible replacement for	NOVADOSI.LBR
                               | the std. CP/M BDOS. It can be made to closely
                               | emulate ZRDOS. Rel. I fixes a bug which
                               | occasionally caused files to be totally
                               | "hidden" from DOS & appli-cations. Fn 6
                               | lookahead char bypass fixed. Option to
                               | eleminate path support added. All sources
                               | included.
9NVDIUPDT.LBR    31104  06-08-93  This file contains a bug fix and a couple of	NVDIUPDT.LBR
                               | improvements for NovaDOS release I. A problem
                               | with passing ^S as keyboard input with fn 6
                               | is fixed, Fn 42 (get/set path address) has
                               | been overhauled. A new, im- proved version of
                               | DOSPATH is included. Lindsay Haisley (512)
                               | 259-1190
0NVDSCRDT.NOT      384  06-08-93  The NovaDOS manual for release H erroneously	NVDSCRDT.NOT
                               | credits Alpha Systems with ownership of the
                               | program JetLDR. JetLDR is by Bridger Mitchell
                               | and is the exclusive property of Plu*Perfect
                               | Systems.
0NVDSHBUG.FIX     1408  06-08-93  NovaDOS has a minor bug which can cause	NVDSHBUG.FIX
                               | characters to get "lost" and reappear in
                               | unusual places under certain circumstances.
                               | This problem surfaced with Rob Friefeld's
                               | excellent LSH program which uses fn 6 for
                               | command line input. The fix is simple and
                               | does not increase NovaDOS code size. File may
                               | be located in the NOVADOS: directory.
0NVDSSTAK.NOT     2688  06-08-93  Notes on possible stack overflow problems	NVDSSTAK.NOT
                               | with NovaDOS and solutions thereto.
9NVDSUTIL.LBR    19968  06-08-93  Support utilities for NovaDOS. Includes:	NVDSUTIL.LBR
                               | PUBLIC, to designate files public under
                               | NovaDOS; DOSPATH, to manage DOS paths; PFILE,
                               | to con-trol the R/O status of public files;
