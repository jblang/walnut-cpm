9ACMDU11.LBR      8320  06-07-93  Version 1.1 of ACMDUTIL. ACMDUTIL allows you	ACMDU11.LBR
                               | to add, delete and view aliases in an
                               | ALIAS.CMD file without a word processor.
                               | ACMDUTIL was written for those of us who
                               | write aliases on the fly. Version 1.1 now
                               | searches BASE: rather than ROOT: for the
                               | ALIAS.CMD file and takes an optional DU: on
                               | the command line to find any copy of
                               | ALIAS.CMD.
9ACOPY33.LBR     25728  06-07-93  Fast CP/M & ZCPR3 Z80 file copy utility.	ACOPY33.LBR

                               | destination disk directory entries in RAM for
                               | extra fast copying. Flexible command line
                               | option and configuration control over many
                               | aspects of the copy process. You can specify
                               | up to 3 excluded filenames. Supports wildcard
                               | user numbers for hard disk backups. Expanded
                               | 'U' option status messages. Companion to DD,

9ACREATE3.LBR    22144  06-07-93  This is a file I got from the SIMTEL20	ACREATE3.LBR
                               | (ArpaNet) archives. I have not examined it
                               | but assume it is more material on creating
                               | aliases.
9ADIR26.LBR      10240  06-07-93  Alias Directory. Accepts command line mask.	ADIR26.LBR

                               | incorporates my improvements and adds a few
                               | more of his own. Program is now only 1K!
9ARRAY10B.LBR    54784  06-07-93  Update of ARRAY10A fixes a bug in the error	ARRAY10B.LBR
                               | return of one of the routines. Minor changes
                               | in comments in the source files. No change in
                               | functions or function names.

                               | changes: (1) Carson Wilson updated its
                               | date/time routines to work with Z3PLUS; (2)
                               | when MCL overflow occurs, the error handler
                               | will now be invoked; (3) the code has been
                               | made more rigorous in a number of areas; (4)
                               | several bugs, including problems with the $RA
                               | parameter, have been fixed. Version 'U' has
                               | minor bug fix over 'T'. Jay Sage, October 10,
                               | 1990
9BAK14.LBR        7808  06-07-93  A ZCPR3 utility that erases all files with a	BAK14.LBR
                               | filetype of BAK on the default or a specified
                               | drive/user. Version 1.4 now reports disk free
                               | space after the files are erased. Type- 3 and
                               | Type-4 versions included.
9BU17.LBR        50688  06-07-93  No description available.	BU17.LBR

9CCOUNT10.LBR    25088  06-07-93  Counts characters in text files. Reports both	CCOUNT10.LBR
                               | the total number of characters and counts for
                               | characters specified on the command line.
                               | Optionally, CCOUNT can report individual
                               | counts for all characters, including control
                               | characters, and can ignore high bits or not.
                               | Counting is done via 32-bit integers. Both
                               | ZCPR3 and vanilla CP/M are supported.
9CHKDIR11.LBR    27264  06-07-93  CHKDIR is based on CLEANDIR 1.8, but contains	CHKDIR11.LBR
                               | only diagnostic code. It does no writing, so
                               | it poses no danger to your directory or to
                               | !!!TIME&.DAT files. It calls error handler on
                               | error so ZEX or SUB can be aborted. It checks
                               | for duplicate entries, extents and users
                               | greater than 31, records greater than 128,
                               | illegal filename characters, duplicate
                               | allocation groups assignments. Version 1.1
                               | now works on P2D date-stamped disks.
9CMD14.LBR        9344  06-07-93  Version 1.4 of CMD introduces a major change	CMD14.LBR
                               | in prompted operation -- CMD now reinvokes
                               | itself after each command until an empty
                               | command line (a RETURN alone) or a Control-C
                               | is entered. Control-C also exits the current
                               | shell (if any) as in Version 1.3. In this
                               | way, CMD can act like an MS-DOS or UNIX
                               | "secondary shell" invocation for true Z-
                               | System shells as well as for "ZCPR2-style"
                               | shells like MEX with MEX2Z or Sage modified
                               | WS4.

9CONCAT16.LBR    53632  06-07-93  Concatenates two or more source files into a	CONCAT16.LBR
                               | new file, or appends them to an existing
                               | file. Allows elaborate operations with files
                               | pulled from various drives and user areas
                               | with numerous options. Checks disk space
                               | before doing anything and allows redirected
                               | I/O to and from CON:, LST:, and AUX:. Version
                               | 1.6 fixes a CON: input bug. ZCPR3 only.
9COPY171.LBR     37248  06-07-93  This update of the ZSDOS file copying program	COPY171.LBR
                               | offers improved control over the erasure of
                               | read-only files. It also contains many bug
                               | fixes and should now work correctly uner
                               | ZRDOS, Z3Plus and even vanilla CP/M. Howard
                               | Goldstein/Hal Bower, 3/24/91
9CP31.LBR        25216  06-07-93  A modified version of Leor Zolman's fast and	CP31.LBR
                               | versatile file copy program. This version is
                               | based on the one included with the Alpha test
                               | package of Z-System BDS C. A serious bug that
                               | allowed a file to be copied into itself has
                               | been corrected, and several enhancements have
                               | been added.
9CPA13.LBR       19840  06-07-93  No description available.	CPA13.LBR
9CPD15.LBR       30592  06-07-93  A ZCPR3 utility to compare two directories	CPD15.LBR
                               | and indicate which files are in both
                               | directories and which are only in one. Disk
                               | file output of matched or unmatched
                               | filenames. Upper- or lower-case display. Sets
                               | error flag if directories don't match. Can
                               | set archive attribute on files which exist in
                               | both directories. Version 1.5 fixes a rather
                               | serious bug.
9CPSET13.LBR     15744  06-07-93  CPSET allows interactive setting and display	CPSET13.LBR
                               | of the terminal and printer parameters in the
                               | Z-System environment. Version 1.3 has a
                               | configurable "quiet" option which can also be
                               | toggled from the command line. Howard
                               | Goldstein 10/31/90
9CR28SRC.LBR    111232  06-07-93  This is the source code for CRUNCH and UNCR	CR28SRC.LBR
                               | 2.8, including REL modules and technical
                               | documentation, for those who need it. For
                               | executable files and program documentation,
                               | get CRUNCH28.LBR.
9CRCZ11.LBR      25600  06-07-93  CRCZ calculates the cyclic-redundancy	CRCZ11.LBR
                               | checksum (CRC) for a group of files,
                               | displaying the checksums on the screen,
                               | typing them to the printer, and/or writing
                               | them to a file. In validation mode, CRCZ
                               | reads a checksum file and matches the listed
                               | CRC values to files on the disk. For ZCPR3
                               | only. Version 1.1 corrects a bug or two and
                               | adds remote system security features.
9CRUNCH28.LBR    39936  06-07-93  File compression and decompression tools for	CRUNCH28.LBR
                               | ZCPR3 and CP/M. UNCR works on crunched,
                               | squeezed, and LZH files. Under ZSDOS date
                               | stamps are embedded in crunched file and
                               | restored when uncrunched. Can exclude system
                               | files. Handles up to 512 matching files.
                               | ZCNFG configuration. PCP support. More
                               | compact displays. Version 2.8 fixes a couple
                               | of bugs and includes smaller ZCPR3-only
                               | versions.
9DA30.LBR        19840  06-07-93  Designed to be complementary to D.COM (latest	DA30.LBR
                               | version D14), DA is a file attribute
                               | manipulation and display utility. It offers a
                               | more compact display that most such
                               | utilities, so you can see more files per
                               | screenful, and the files are alphabetic. It
                               | allows you to easily set or reset all user-
                               | resettable file attributes (f1-f4,f8,t1-13).
9DETABZ14.LBR    20096  06-07-93  DETAB-Z replaces ASCII tabs in text files	DETABZ14.LBR
                               | with the correct number of spaces. No other
                               | characters are affected: control characters
                               | are not removed, high-bits are not reset.
                               | Under ZSDOS create file stamps are preserved.
                               | Version 1.4 is much faster, optimizes some of
                               | the code, and corrects a couple of bugs from
                               | previous versions. For ZCPR3 only.
9DEV11A.LBR       9856  06-07-93  Version 1.1A strips high bits from EFCB	DEV11A.LBR
                               | characters in help screens. Bruce Morgen

9DIFF30.LBR      28288  06-07-93  DIFF version 3.0 is an extensively modified	DIFF30.LBR
                               | and improved version of the original ZCPR 3.0
                               | DIFF utility by Richard Conn. The program's
                               | basic functions have been enhanced to take
                               | advantage of ZCPR 3.3 and 3.4, and several
                               | additional functions have been added.
                               | Datestamping features are available if DIFF
                               | is used under ZSDOS, Z3PLUS, and/or DosDisk,
                               | but these system enhancements are not
                               | required by DIFF.
