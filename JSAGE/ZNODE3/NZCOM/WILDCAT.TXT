NZ-SAFE.TZT   Text file about du: and dir: safety features of NZ-COM/ZCPR34.
NZ-SRC.LBR    Source to the various NZ-COM segments for the information of and use resulting REL files useless. No linker that I know of can resolve th NZRCP.REL file. Please don't complain about that. Your problem is immediately solved by ordering NZ-COM and joining the New Z-System revolution. More on .ZRL formats in an article by Bridger in the forth coming issue of The Computer Journal.
NZBEGIN.LBR   This library collects four first-rate articles on NZCOM that make its purpose and workings accessible to those with no prior experience with ZCPR or NZCOM. It is also valuable even to those who are running NZCOM, as they may discover a new trick or two. Articles by Rick Swenton, excerpted from four issues of Pieces of 8, The Newsletter of the Connecticut CP/M Users Group.

NZREL12B.NOT  This is the RELEASE.NOT file from the version 1.2B release of NZ-COM as of November 20, 1988. Jay Sage
ZSNZBI11.LBR  This is a replacement for NZBIO.ZRL that builds a shell around BIOS disk calls, preserving IX and IY. Its primary use is fixing BIOSes that use IX and IY so ZSDOS will run with them.
ZSNZBI12.LBR  Version 1.2 of ZSNZBIO takes the protection of the BDOS/CCP/TPA from the CBIOS in NZCOM systems to the logical limits - IX, IY, AF', BC', DE', and HL' are now protected on ALL CBIOS calls. This NZCOM BIO replacement is a must for ZSDOS on any system that uses IX and IY in BIOS and will probably cure some strange ills on other systems (whose BIOS authors must have thought everybody runs all 8080 code!).
