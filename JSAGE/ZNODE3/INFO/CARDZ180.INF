                             C a r d Z 1 8 0


A  peripheral card and software package for Apple ][ series that  will 
move your computer into the future of 8-bit computing.

The CardZ180 System combines a high-speed 8-bit CPU co-processor  card 
with the latest in 8-bit operating systems and utilities.

The  CardZ180 System was designed by experienced Apple CP/M users  and 
has  been  extensively tested and refined over a 2 year  period.   Its 
features  satisfy the needs of beginners while still going beyond  the 
dreams of even the most advanced CP/M users.

The  architecture of the CardZ180 System follows that of  the  popular 
PCPI  Applicard.   Device  drivers are resident in  the  Apple's  6502 
memory  area  while up to 1 Megabyte of DRAM memory is  available  for 
CardZ180 System use.

The  Operating System (O/S) is the recently released  ZDDOS/ZSDOS  and 
NZCOM  combination.   This  incredible  OS  allows  "on-the-fly"   O/S 
reconfiguration  for  command/memory  optimization.  As  part  of  the 
popular "Z-System", it has often been called a mix of CP/M, MS-DOS and 
UNIX.

Designed  for  the  future,  both the hardware  and  software  of  the 
CardZ180 System have provisions for easy expansion and enhancement.
