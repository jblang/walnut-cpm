  Remember the TREDEX offer of last year?  They were selling the Xerox  DEM-II
 16/8  computer  for  $349, plus $50 shipping, but quickly  sold  out.   Well,
 lightning sometimes strikes twice:
 
 Now  you  can  get the same computer for  $379.95  _including_  UPS  shipping
 anywhere  in  the  United  States.  This  computer  comes  with  low  profile
 programmable  keyboard,  monitor, Z80 and 8086 microprocessors,  10  megabyte
 hard  drive, and one DSDD 5.25" floppy.  The computer comes with either  CP/M
 80  and  CP/M  86  *or* MS-DOS 2.01.  Please note  that  MS-DOS  is  not  IBM
 compatable.

 In addition, an agreement has been made between myself and Art Carlson of The
 Computer  Journal  wherein  you  will receive a one  year  subscript  of  The
 Computer  Journal  with  your purchase of a 16/8.  If  you  are  currently  a
 subsciber,  be sure to send a copy of your address label, and we will  extend
 your subscription by another year.

 In conjunction with Jay Sage, registered NZCOM owners receive a $15 discount.
 To  receive  this,  give us your serial number and who you  bought  it  from.
 Discount  is subject to verification of software registration.  If  you  have
 not purchased NZCOM, then order it with your computer and deduct $15 from the
 total.

 These computers are new,  shipped  to you from Xerox,  and come with a 90 day
 warranty.  All original documentation is included.
