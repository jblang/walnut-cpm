All ZCPR3 and CP/M users:  I have taken the notice of ZSDOS' 
release that Carson Wilson wrote up and added to it information 
about datestamping, which I feel Carson doesn't enough emphasize, 
including an alphabetized list of supported available programs.

                                             - Rick Charnes

        ANNOUNCING:  ZSDOS, NEW CP/M-COMPATIBLE OPERATING
           SYSTEM WITH OPTIONAL BUILT-IN DATESTAMPING 

The following notice of the release of ZSDOS was posted on 
Lillipute Z-Node in Chicago, headquarters BBS of both The 
Computer Journal and the Z-System Special Interest Group, by 
Carson Wilson, author of Z80DOS and now one of several joint 
authors of ZSDOS.  For users with a real-time clock ZSDOS will be 
a godsend.  For those without it will be an absolute joy as full 
datestamping without timestamping will finally be theirs.  One 
thing that I feel Carson's advertisement does not emphasize is 
what I consider to be the most important thing that a user would 
gain from switching from ZRDOS to ZSDOS: the built-in 
datestamping, and with almost no loss of TPA.  With my clock 
driver in my BIOS I have added complete time- and date-stamping 
on my system at a cost of 256 bytes (.25k)

Whether the commercial ZSDOS/DateStamper (the two use the same 
protocol) is superior to the public domain Z80DOS datestamping is 
a question over which wiser men than I continue to spill gallons 
of ink debating.  For myself and many others, however, the issue 
is easily resolved by one factor alone: the number of programs 
that support ZSDOS/DateStamper protocol is far greater than those 
with Z80DOS support.  I have compiled a list of these programs.  
With ZSDOS users of ZCPR3 will have datestamping support for the 
following programs, most of which except MexPlus are non-
commercial and available through the BBS circuit or on the 
ZSDOS distriution disk:

              
APPEND       Concatenate files like PIP can, but inserts the date 
             of concatenation as a line of text between each 
             file.

ARUNZ        Allows for display, manipulation and other use of 
             several date-related parameters in macro command 
             scripts; $dd is the current date, $dm the month, $dy 
             the year $dh the hour, $dn the minute, etc.  
             Extremely useful and powerful.

CRUNCH23D    With the datestamping version of CRUNCH, we can 
             embed the date stamps in the compressed file itself 
             (it's not dependent on the directory entry) and we 
             can thus transfer datestamp information via modem.

DATE         Displays current date on screen.

DATSWEEP     More like NSWEEP with datestamping features added.  
             Displays create, access and modify date of all 
             files.  Can copy or archive files by date using '=', 
             '<' or '>' operators ("copy all files modified in 
             the last two weeks of January").  Can manually 
             change a file's datestamp.

DBASE        Yep, we have a patch for this venerable program.  No 
             longer will you have to enter the date when the 
             program loads as you've been doing for years.  
             ZSDOS/DateStamper will do it for you.

DIFF         Compares files by date or otherwise

FD           "FILEDATE."  Perhaps the most exciting of them all.  
             A directory utility that not only displays the 
             creation, access and modification dates of files in 
             a directory, but is sensitive to and can sort by 
             date.  Options to sort from most recent files to 
             oldest, oldest to newest, list only files modified 
             or created today, only modified/created since a 
             given date, etc.  It truly opens up a whole new 
             world of computing.

LBREXT       Preserves a file's datestamp (create, access and 
             modify) upon extraction from a LBR).

LOG          Perfect way to keep track of how long you spend on 
             each "type" of task on your computer.  Will "log" 
             time spent on each of several self-chosen or given 
             categories into a file for later viewing and 
             displaying.  Excellent for record-keeping for IRS.

LPUT         Preserves a file's datestamp upon insertion into a 
             LBR.

MCAT, XCAT   Complete floppy or hard disk cataloging system; 
             ZSDOS version of Irv Hoff's classics.  Allows user 
             to display to the screen, for example, all files in 
             one's collection of floppy disks created before July 
             1988, or during the month December, 1987, etc.  When 
             used normally, will display files' datestamps along 
             with their names.

MCOPY        Copy program allowing simultaneous copy of multiple 
             unrelated files using filelist feature of ZCPR3.

MEXPLUS      Scripts can display, wait for and measure time.  
             Perhaps my greatest programming feat was a MEXPLUS 
             script to log on to PCP Pursuit.  The script can 
             tell you how long you have been on a BBS, how long 
             you were on the last logged BBS, the current time, 
             how long you have been attempting to connect to PCP, 
             how long was the last attempt, etc.

NT           Loads and saves virtually instantly, NT is a quick 
             "note"-maker and mini-editor.  It begins all files 
             with the current date and time at the top.

PPIP         Copy program, sensitive to archive bit if desired; 
             always preserves date of source to destination.

PRINT        Prints date and time at top of each printed page.

SAVESTMP     For editors other than ZDE that do not preserve 
             creation date.  Stores this stamp information 
             temporarily in a buffer, then re-imprints it onto 
             file upon exit.

SDD          Similar to FILEDATE, but more limited.  Only 
             displays filedates, cannot sort by date.

TIME         Displays current time on screen.

UNCRUNCH     Uncompresses the file and restores its datestamp.

WAIT         Will "wait" until a specific time before performing 
             a given operation.  Useful for SUBMIT scripts and 
             other multiple-command line operations.

ZCAL         With no parameters, displays a calendar of the 
             current month with the current day highlighted.  
             With parameters it will display a calendar of any 
             month in the 20th century.

ZDE          Coming shortly.  ZCPR3/ZSDOS version of VDE.  
             Automatically preserve a file's creation date after 
             editing.

ZFILER       Extraordinary file management utility shell.  Like 
             NSWEEP taken to the 100th power. Displays current 
             time on the screen, preserves datestamp of copied or 
             "moved" files.

ZMANAGER     Another file utility menu/shell, displays current 
             time on screen, etc.

                     Z-System Disk Operating System

AFTER a year of intense work and nearly three years of background 
research, ZSDOS is ready!  The package includes over 300k of 
files and nearly 150 pages of documentation, and is available for 
$75.00 plus $3 shipping from Plu*Perfect Systems (owners of ZRDOS 
may upgrade for $60.00 plus $3 shipping).

ZSDOS replaces the BDOS segment of CP/M 2.2, and offers 
programmers and users of all types of Z80 computers a host of 
enhancements not yet found in any CP/M compatible operating 
system, including:

     o Built-in DateStamper-type file datestamping.  If desired, full 
       datestamping can be implemented at the cost of under 512 bytes of 
       TPA, or if your system already has a real-time clock and driver, no 
       TPA at all is required.

     o Public and Path Access to files.  Now programs can access any file 
       from anywhere on your system.  Public and path may be combined for 
       even greater efficiency, and either form of access may be set to 
       read-write or read-only for greater security.

     o ZSDOS is dynamically configurable by the user or by programs.  File 
       access modes, the path, fast fixed disk relog, Wheel protection, 
       disk read only sustain, the clock address, file datestamping, and 
       other capabilities of ZSDOS may be reconfigured even while programs 
       are operating.

     o Menu-Driven Installation.  Even clock driver installation takes 
       place automatically, and no assembly language skill whatsoever are 
       required to get a full ZSDOS system up and running.

     o Eleven fully tested utility programs are included to help you use 
       the full power of ZSDOS to automate file and system maintenance and 
       daily planning.

     o The ZSDOS User's Manual explains in plain terms how and why ZSDOS 
       works, how to install ZSDOS, and how to use the utilities, and 
       consists of 147 full-size looseleaf pages of laser printed text 
       including a table of contents, a glossary, an annotated 
       bibliography, an index, and many useful appendices.

In addition, ZSDOS includes all of the capabilities of CP/M 2.2, 
ZRDOS, P2DOS, and Z80DOS, and removes all of the defects of those 
systems:

     o Floppy disks are automatically reset when changed.  

     o Error messages are in plain English and give a full report of the 
       function, drive, and file involved, and read or write errors are 
       retryable.  Error handling may be taken over by the application 
       program as with CP/M Plus.  ZSDOS error return codes provide more 
       information than those of other BDOS replacements.

     o ZSDOS supports file sizes of up to 32 megabytes and disk sizes of up 
       to 1 gigabyte.

     o Fast fixed disk relog allows users of hard disks to skip the time-
       consuming relogs required by CP/M.

     o All ZRDOS 1.7 functions are supported by ZSDOS, so all programs 
       which work under ZRDOS versions 1.7 and before are also usable under 
       ZSDOS.  Popular ZRDOS features such as re-entrancy, file archiving, 
       and wheel protection are fully supported by ZSDOS.

     o ZSDOS is compatible with Plu*Perfect's BackGrounder II, the 
       windowing and task-switching system for Z80 computers.

     o ZSDOS adds ten new function calls to CP/M 2.2, and enhances and 
       corrects CP/M functions 6, 10, and 37.

IN SUMMARY, ZSDOS offers significant improvements over ZRDOS, 
P2DOS, and Z80DOS, and offers _amazing_ improvements over CP/M 
2.2!  ZSDOS is available now from
