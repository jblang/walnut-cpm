                               | I've wanted to do for ages. I've compiled a

                               | programs that support ZSDOS/DateStamper

                               | WordPerfect), and wrote a little blurb about
                               | each. If I had just purchased ZSDOS and/or
                               | were just starting out with datestamping I
                               | think I'd find this list mighty handy and
                               | useful. - Rick Charnes
