                           CP/M SOFTWARE VENDORS LIST

The information in this listing is placed in the public domain for non-
commercial use only.

Note:  "CP/M" is a trademark of Digital Research, Inc., for its 8-bit
operating system software.  Recognizing DRI's trademark rights (in a
product it isn't even selling any more) I nevertheless use the term "CP/M"
here sometimes also in a broader sense as referring to all forms of CP/M
operating system software issued by Digital Research, Inc. (most commonly
version 1.4, 2.2, and 3.0, the last also known as CP/M Plus or CP/M+), and
to all replacements or substitutes for those operating systems for 8-bit
computers utilizing Z80 and 8080 chips, including but not limited to Z-
System, NZCOM, Z3PLUS, ZCPR (all versions, including ZCPR1, EZCRP, ZCPR2,
ZCPR 3.0, 3.3, and 3.4) [some or all of which are trademarks of Alpha
Systems], XCCP, QPM, ConIX, etc. [some of which may be trademarks of other
vendors].

                       1.  Why A CP/M Vendors List?

Today, media coverage of topics of interest to the CP/M computer owner has
dwindled to the point of almost non-existence, and the number of computer
magazines that offer any regular coverage of CP/M can be counted on
one hand.  As a result, a company or vendor that still has CP/M software
for sale cannot justify advertising its products since the potential market
is so diffused.  This list is an attempt to provide a reference source for
CP/M users to consult so they can know who is still supplying software for
CP/M and what software is available.

While this list is far from a complete listing of all companies, vendors, and 
user groups offering software for use on CP/M, it is hoped that it will become a 
major reference source for all CP/M users.  It is intended that this list will 
be updated and new releases issued periodically.  The next release is expected 
late in 1989 or early in 1990.

In compiling recent revisions of this list I came to the conclusion that it
would be useful to add to this list sources of hardware with special CP/M
significance.  There are folks out there who specialize in supporting on a
national basis Kaypro, Osborne, Epson QX and Geneva, Xerox 820, and other
CP/M systems.  It wouldn't be possible to list every local dealer who ever
handled Kaypros or Osbornes and who still provides that service, but some
dealers have become sources for parts, special ROMs, and similar items.  I
have no doubt that this section of the list could use a lot of work.

Every effort has been made to verify the information contained in this list, the 
compilers and revisors cannot be held responsible for errors in the list, nor 
can any guarantees be made on the suitability or continued availability of the 
software described in the listing.

                         2.  How To Use This List.

This software section of list is divided into several sections.  The first
section consists of companies and vendors who are selling commercial CP/M
software packages.  The second section consists of companies and user
groups who are selling public domain software for use on CP/M.  The third
section consists of Z-Nodes that also sell other CP/M products in addition
to selling proprietary Z-System software.  (Z-Nodes are remote access
computer systems  (RAS) which can be accessed by the public though the use
of a modem.  All Z-Nodes allow for the downloading of both CP/M and Z-
System public domain software.  Also Z-System or CP/M proprietary software
may be down-loaded from those Z-Nodes that are selling it).

CFOG and many other user groups sell Z-System software (NZCOM, Z3-PLUS, ZS-DOS, 
etc.) to their members, often at a discount.  If you are a member of a user 
group, check to see whether it sells Z-System software at a discount.  If it 
doesn't, you may want to encourage it to contact Alpha Systems or Sage 
MicroSystems East about becoming a source for Z-System software.

Entries in each section are organized alphabetically by the name of the
company, vendor, or user group.  Besides the name, each entry in the list
also includes the mailing address, and telephone number(s).  A brief
description is included of what software packages or services are offered.
The availability of either brochures or a catalog about the products is
also included.   Prices, if given, are suggested retail and are not based
on any discounts or special sales.  Also noted is the availability of the
software for use in other operating environments such as DOS, CP/M-86, etc.

Finally, between two asterisks (*) a date is given.  The information was
verified by a direct contact, receipt of a flyer, or publication of an
advertisement at or about the time of the date.  A series of four asterisks
(****) indicates no recent verification.  I wrote to several of the
companies so listed in March 1989 and did not receive any response from
them, but neither did the mail come back.  If you have recent (1989)
verification of any such company, please notify me.

3.  Revision History

Revision J:  22 December 1989 (Bob Dean)

Added Ampro, Micromint.  (To Ben Cohen: hope you don't mind my simply
re-issuing, this list is very easily updated *directly* too.)

  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *

Revision I:  04 September 1989

A few new items, Derby and Quinsept, from MicroCornucopia.  Poseidon Electronics

Help, published by COMCO, Inc., of Bettendorf, IA.
