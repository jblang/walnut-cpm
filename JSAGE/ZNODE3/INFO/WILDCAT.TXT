FILEDATE.MZG  This is the text of a message I sent to Carson Wilson on Lillipute Z-Node #1 about his extraordinary program FILEDATE.COM, a fully DateStamper-compatible directory program with a huge number of options to sort a directory by date. It is still in beta- testing and will be released with the new DOSes, ZDDOS and ZSDOS, but I have been beta- testing it and find it quite amazing and wanted folks to have a taste of what's to come. - Rick Charnes, 6/3/88

HISTSHEL.NOT  
HISTSHEL.NZT  4608 06-08-93 Urgently soliciting comments on suggestion that a feature be included in new history shell now being developed by Rob Friefeld. When one is typing multiple commands directly at the ZCPR3 prompt, one could reference a token appearing earlier on the command line without retyping it. Instead of RENAME JONES.LTR HARVEY.LTR;VDE JONES.LTR we could type, using "$" as the "escape character" that indicates relative position from left, "RENAME JONES.LTR HARVEY.LTR;VDE $3".

ZSDOS.ANN     
ZSDOS.AZN     I have added to Carson Wilson's announcement of the shipping of ZSDOS by doing something I've wanted to do for ages. I've compiled a list of all known (to me) CP/M and ZCPR3 programs that support ZSDOS/DateStamper datestamping, alphabetized them (thanks, WordPerfect), and wrote a little blurb about each. If I had just purchased ZSDOS and/or were just starting out with datestamping I think I'd find this list mighty handy and useful. - Rick Charnes
