 KENMORE REAL TIME CLOCKS

 Are  you  looking for a real-time clock for your Z80 computer?   The  Kenmore
 Clock is about the easiest and most versatile RTC available.  Installation is
 quick  and easy.  Begin by setting the port for your computer.   Then  simply
 unplug  your Z80 microprocessor, plug the clock board in its socket and  plug
 the Z80 into the clock.  (Note: a few computers require an extender cable due
 to tight cabinets).  The supplied software is used to set or read the clock.

 The  Kenmore is an intelligent clock keeping accurate track of  days,  months
 and years as well as the time.  This is a perfect addition to your system and
 works well with ZD/ZSDOS, and Z80DOS.
