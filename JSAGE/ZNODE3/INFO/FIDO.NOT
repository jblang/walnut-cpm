** FIDO.NOT **

-- Aug. 14, 1988.

It is desirable to add Fido echomail capability to an
RCP/M such as PBBS/HBBS/DRBBS. I have some suggestions
on how this might be done.

The Fido boards I have observed use a LOADER program,
such as Blinkyterm. It should be possible to add a
similar Loader program to PBBS. When a user calls
the system, BYE would run PLOADER (instead of PBBS).
The Loader would check the system clock. If the time
was within normal bbs hours, then it would load and
run PBBS. The remaining System time until Network
Operation would be poked into PBBS, and optionally
posted. PBBS would be modified so a user could not
stay online longer than the remaining System time.
If the time was within NETWORK hours, PLOADER
would proceed with Fido Net operations instead.
It would display a message such as 'Nework Operations
Enabled -- Please hang up'.

That would basically take care of the mechanics of
Fido Net receiving. If it was desired to *call*
another Fido capable board, then BYE would have to
be modified with a hook to run a CALLER program
at a preset time.

I understand that FIDO messages (ie. in the FIDO bbs
program) consist of separate files for *each* message.
Whether or not that format would be required for Fido
Net operations remains to be seen. Also, I believe
Fido Net transfers use Sealink protocol. Whether
or not they can use other protocols as well is
unknown. I believe Sealink is something like ZMODEM
in that the blocks are large and it is bi-directional.
Naturally, if Sealink is required, then it must be
built into PLOADER and PCALLER.

Some niceties to consider would be the capability of
PCALLER to use PC Pursuit where possible. That would
require additional code to call PC Pursuit, and reach
the Node and board. If PC Pursuit was unusable for
some reason, the software should be configurable to
abort or to phone direct. Automated operation may be
somewhat tricky because of the complexities of PC Pursuit.
Another thing to consider would be the keeping of a Fido log
of received and called boards, and echoed message numbers and
stats. It could be displayed to the Sysop with a utility
similar to NEW. Still another feature which might
be added to PLOADER would be the capability to enable
extended or different user access times during certain
hours (such as giving all users 3 hours access from 1am
to 6am).

I realize this article is very sketchey. I will attempt
to find out more and get it here.
