;The whole idea of this is to automate the sending of messages, and
;shorten your time on CIS and save $$. Be sure to read the QTERM.DOC, 
;as well as the SCRIPTS.QTM file, both in the QTERM LBRs.

;
;Here's another section.. used for Composing new messages.

;Be aware that the numbers in the reply need to be edited every time
;you send a reply. As well as the name of the reply. To send several 
;replies, simply repeat the reply section starting with the rep # and 
;ending with the Post.
;
;The following is the same as the original QTMES.SCR . Please be aware
;that these commands CAN be used for any Modem program:
;
;Well.. I hope this helps some of you and you get to be proficient with 
;QTERM. Even though ZMP runs more options, I've found QTERM's scripts to 
;be really fast when dialing in.. and a real timesaver for use on CIS, as 
;well as a timesaver for dialing into Starlink. What with all those numbers
;and ID's to dial..whew. 
;
;A note here for NON-QTERM users who are on CIS. Please look at the CIS scripts.
;The commands I'm using are standard CIS commands, and can be used with ANY 
;modem program for fast capture or sending of messages. Again.. having an 
;external modem running at 1200b or 2400b really helps. And again.. these 
;scripts for QTERM are for use with an external modem <unless you have 
;adapted it for the Sydmodem 1200 internal modem>.
;
;Enjoy it!
