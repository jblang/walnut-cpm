The following is a general purpose READ file for placing calls
via Telenet.   It assumes that the PREFIX is null (PREFIX "") and 
that the SUFFIX is a RETURN (SUFFIX "^M").  These are the default 
values on my system.   I've named this file CALLTO.MEX  The local 
Telenet number is in the PHONE list. It is invoked by:
READ CALLTO <AREA CODE> <NUMBER> [<CAPTURE FILE>]
  
                                       (remarks not part of file)

     STAT WTECHO OFF                  not needed, just slows us
     STAT WECHO 1                     fast for initial call-up
     STAT REPLY 1
     STAT RETRY 1
     SENDOUT "ATM0"                   to silence modem
     DIAL TELENET
     SENDOUT "^M"                     two returns go get started
     SENDOUT ""                       respond to TERMINAL=
     SENDOUT "C DIAL{1}//12,YOURID"   respond to @
     STAT WECHO 4                     slow down for packets
     SENDOUT "PASSWORD"               your password, of course
     SENDOUT "ATZ"
     SENDOUT "ATDT{2}"
     T {3:CAPTURE.NEW}

For frequently called numbers a dedicated file can be created by
copying the CALLTO file, and then filling in parameters 1, 2 and
3.  My file to call the Net-exchange BBS (NEX.MEX) is

     STAT CRC ON         set CRC/CHECKSUM to match bbs
     STAT WTECHO OFF
     STAT WECHO 1
     STAT REPLY 1
     STAT RETRY 1
     SENDOUT "ATM0"
     DIAL TELENET
     SENDOUT "^M"
     SENDOUT ""
     SENDOUT "C DIAL202//12,YOURID"
     STAT WECHO 4
     SENDOUT "PASSWORD"
     SENDOUT "ATZ"
     SENDOUT "ATDT6893561"
     T {1:CAPTURE.NEX}   option to specify different capture file 

Thats all there is to it.  Have fun.
