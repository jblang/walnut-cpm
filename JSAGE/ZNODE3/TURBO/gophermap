9NZ-TOOL4.LBR    25856  06-08-93  This is an update to Joe Wright's initial	NZ-TOOL4.LBR
                               | release. This library shows how you can
                               | develop Z-System utilities with Turbo Pascal.
                               | The include file NZ-TOOL.BOX contains the
                               | needed environment access routines. An
                               | interesting bug involving Turbo Pascal's use
                               | of the transient buffer has been repaired by
                               | using Z-System's multiple command line
                               | buffer. The library also contains an article
                               | which will appear in the premier issue of
                               | Eight Bits And Change, a national computer
                               | and humor magalog
9NZ-TURBO.LBR    13184  06-08-93  Collection of Turbo Pascal functions and	NZ-TURBO.LBR
                               | procedures allowing easy access to NZ-System
                               | by the Turbo Pascal programmer. Please let me
                               | know what you think. Joe Wright
9SHELL11M.LBR     8576  06-08-93  Shell version 1.1mb, is a replacement for the	SHELL11M.LBR
                               | Turbo Modula-2 SHELL.MCD that gives you
                               | compile/edit/run capabilities from the system
                               | prompt level plus all the standard
                               | capabilities from within the shell. Also
                               | allows you to set and save the drive search
                               | path from the options menu. This version
                               | works only with the 64180 SB180/SB180FX
                               | version 1.0 of the M2 system. Look for the
                               | Z80 version soon. Bill Greathouse
