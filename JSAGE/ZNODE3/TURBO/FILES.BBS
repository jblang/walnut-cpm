NZ-TOOL4.LBR This is an update to Joe Wright's initial release. This library shows how you can develop Z-System utilities with Turbo Pascal. The include file NZ-TOOL.BOX contains the needed environment access routines. An interesting bug involving Turbo Pascal's use of the transient buffer has been repaired by using Z-System's multiple command line buffer. The library also contains an article which will appear in the premier issue of Eight Bits And Change, a national computer and humor magalog
NZ-TURBO.LBR Collection of Turbo Pascal functions and procedures allowing easy access to NZ-System by the Turbo Pascal programmer. Please let me know what you think. Joe Wright
SHELL11M.LBR Shell version 1.1mb, is a replacement for the Turbo Modula-2 SHELL.MCD that gives you compile/edit/run capabilities from the system prompt level plus all the standard capabilities from within the shell. Also allows you to set and save the drive search path from the options menu. This version works only with the 64180 SB180/SB180FX version 1.0 of the M2 system. Look for the Z80 version soon.
