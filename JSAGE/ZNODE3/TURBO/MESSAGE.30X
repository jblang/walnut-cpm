ZSDOS HELP,
Yep, I definitely want to know about such things.  I will see to it the
correct is made.  Thanks very much.

VARIOUS,
I got your package and will be working on -- although this is far from
a "one-evening project".  
.
Apparently you and Bruce were unable to talk me out of modifying
MDINIT.  I disassembled it and modified it.  That WAS a one-evening
project.  The new version now has a convenient use that I had never
thought of before:  it can be used to quickly clear a RAM disk, writing
a new T&D file in the process.  I discovered this while working on the
new ZSLIB release.  My scratch RAM disk partition several times ended
up with 300-400 files on it.  It would have taken quite a while to
erase them with ERASE.COM, but MDINIT11 wiped the partition clean in
about two seconds!  I can't release this version because it's part
of a commercial package, but I'm uploading it privately so you can
look at it if you're interested.
.
Sometimes I'm a little stubborn!   :-)

LGET13,
BTW, Who uploaded LGET13.LBR?  I can't find it in the NEW file.
LGET is a standard ZCPR3 utility, but there's no source code included
and I don't know who to upbraid.

ZSLIB,
P.S. -- You can remove ZSLIB30 and ZSL30SRC from BETA.  I will upload
the general release source code ZSL31SRC as soon as disk space is
available...

LGET AND MDINIT,
First, I must have picked up LGET13 somewhere else and put it up here.
That's why it is not in the NEW file (and also why I tell everyone to read
FOR and not just NEW).  If my memory serves, Bruce Morgen was the author,
so you can try upbraiding him (yeah, just try!).
 
I'll take a look at your MDINIT. Doing that work was a TOTAL WASTE OF
TIME, but now that you've done it, you stubborn guy, we might as well take
advantage of it :-)  Seriously, though, I don't see why we can't release
at least the COM file.  Does it work on any RAM disk or only the one on
the SB180?  If it is completely general, then we might want to try to get
permission.  If it's for the SB180 only, then everyone who can use it
has a right to it already, I believe.

LDIR MATTER,
One more suggestion for LDIR.  I just ran into a problem with some junk
in the comment field of a compressed file.  It seems to have sent control
characters to my screen and done some weird things.  Someone nasty could
blow away a terminal configuration that way.  I think it would be best to
apply a pretty strong filter to the comment field before sending it to the
terminal.
 
The other problem I was having (going off into never-never land) has not
reappeared with 190.

MDINIT,
MDINIT is completely XBIOS dependant.  It determines if XBIOS is running
and determines if the drive is a RAM disk before it does anything (which
makes it a nearly completely safe utility).  It's not of interest to
anyone not running XBIOS.

ZTIME 1.1,
Well, you're right!  It doesn't work.  First, it requires ZSLIB 
3.1 and that wasn't available until today.  Then I mistakenly 
uploaded a version of ZTIME that I had libraried a week ago, 
before I had experimented with a custom time-setting module.  I 
have now gathered together the correct version, changed it to 
version 1.1, and uploaded it.  This one has been tested with a 
custom module.  I had planned to upload ZSLIB31 at the same time 
as ZTIME10, but Rob Friefeld's bug report delayed the ZSLIB 
release by a day.  It didn't matter, though, because the CUSTOM 
equate was not available in the source code for ZTIME10.
.
It's too late to give you a call, but you have my most sincere 
thanks for the prompt bug report.

22NCE126,
Hello Howard... Thank you for the info. Sydex is now located 102 miles
from Portland and so I can contact them or check on one of a few other
boards for the latest release. Ben.
