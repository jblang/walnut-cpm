Note on RCPCLED 1.5
August 12, 1991
Rob Friefeld

CLED 1.5 does not work with the Z-System command scheduler AT.  AT must 
know that a shell is running.  It determines that by checking ZCPR's 
Command Status Flag.  CLED must not reset this flag until it is ready to 
exit.

Code is easily modified.  Eliminate "Subtask 1".  Before "Subtask 4" 
place the old Subtask 1 code.  (See below).

Note that a shell is only interrupted by AT if there has been no console 
activity for a preset time interval.  If you are actively using the 
shell, AT will not break in.  If you are leaving the machine unattended 
and expect a scheduled task to execute, it is OK to leave a shell (CLED, 
LSH, ZFILER) running.  It is NOT OK to leave an application running.

Here is a source code replacement section:
