9CALCRCP.ZZ0      7552  06-07-93  Eric Meyer's classic HP.COM redone as a Z3	CALCRCP.ZZ0
                               | RCP that cam be run without leaving your text
                               | editor. Very handy idea by Carson Wilson.
9CLED15.LBR      38784  06-07-93  RCPCLED, Version 1.5 update has some	CLED15.LBR
                               | improvements and smaller code size. U/L by
                               | Rob Friefeld
0CLED15.NOT       1536  06-07-93  Note on modifying CLED 1.5 code for	CLED15.NOT
                               | compatibility with AT task scheduler.
9DEBUGRCP.AQM    19584  06-07-93  There have been a number of requests for this	DEBUGRCP.AQM
                               | RCP that gives you a memory resident MU3 (the
                               | memory utility for Z3 that reads what you
                               | have in memory). You asked for it and you got
                               | it.

9FCP10.LBR       17792  06-07-93  New flow control package with many new	FCP10.LBR
                               | features, the most significant being: 1) new
                               | commands AND and OR for combining tests, IFQ
                               | for displaying entire IF status; 2) automatic
                               | detection of colon in command invocation so
                               | that the transient IF.COM (COMIF) can be used
                               | even if the option is coded in the resident
                               | FCP; 3) ability to load the transient IF.COM
                               | in high memory so as not to affect the TPA
                               | and allow use of the GO and SAVE commands
                               | after transient IF processing.

9GKEY2.LBR        7040  06-07-93  a simple but small and useful key-definition	GKEY2.LBR
                               | program for any CP/M or Z-System computer.
9IOPCLK10.LBR    22656  06-07-93  IOPCLK loads and removes a ZSDOS clock NZCOM	IOPCLK10.LBR
                               | IOP module which runs in the background to
                               | display the current date and time in a
                               | specified host computer message field on your
                               | terminal. IOPCLK updates its display every
                               | second (mm/dd/yy hh:mm:ss) but can be
                               | configured to update it every minute
                               | (mm/dd/yy hh:mm). IOPCLK must be configured
                               | (using ZCNFG) for your terminal. See
                               | IOPCLK10.HZP.
9IOPLDR11.LBR    14208  06-07-93  IOPLDR is a generalized IOP loader REL module	IOPLDR11.LBR
                               | that may be linked to load and remove a
                               | target custom NZCOM IOP module. It performs
                               | all required pre-load checks, environment
                               | validation, and it loads and relocates the
                               | IOP module to the NZIOP buffer for execution
                               | and also removes the loaded IOP module. It is
                               | designed to be called by a simple user-
                               | written custom loader. See IOPLDR11.HZP.
9MKZ3BAS2.LBR     7424  06-07-93  A slightly spiffed version of Herbert zur	MKZ3BAS2.LBR
                               | Nedden's simple Z-Tool for creating an old-
                               | fashioned Z3BASE.LIB for the running ZCPR 3.3
                               | or later Z-System. This makes it possible to
                               | reassemble older, non-relocatable system
                               | segments (such as the Ampro and Micromint
                               | BIOS source files, BYExxx.ASM, etc.) for use
                               | in more modern Z environments.

9NUKEYCLK.LBR     4864  06-07-93  NuKeyClk is a ZCPR33+ program which reads the	NUKEYCLK.LBR
                               | current date and time from internal clock and
                               | loads them into memory for use as a NuKey
                               | macro string. This makes it easy to put the
                               | right date in a Word-star or other document.
                               | Written in Z80 assembler with ZMAC, ZML, and
                               | the V4LIBs and ZSLIB routines. Requires Z-
                               | system. Written by Joe Mortensen
9NUKEYFIX.WY      2816  06-07-93  NuKey gives some people problems. This text	NUKEYFIX.WY
                               | file provides some ARUNZ aliases which work
                               | reliably and get around the problems.
9NZFCP13.LBR     32512  06-07-93  Source code plus the compiled Flow Control	NZFCP13.LBR
                               | Packages (FCP's) distributed in FCP.LBR as
                               | part of the Z System. The precompiled modules
                               | are in Z-Relocatable form, and must be loaded
                               | with JetLDR, NZCOM, or Z3PLUS. Now features
                               | interactive assembly of code a-la- Z34RCP11
                               | under the SLR or ZMAC assemblers. Macro now
                               | reports length of resulting FCP in records
                               | and bytes following assembly. JetLDR signons
                               | also automatically generated. 9/15/90 Carson

9RCPZRL11.LBR   120832  06-07-93  Z-System Resident Command Package (RCP) in Z	RCPZRL11.LBR
                               | relocatable form, version 1.1. NZ-COM,
                               | JetLDR, or Z3PLUS is required to use these
                               | files. The modules are named as RCP-nnxy.ZRL
                               | where "nn" is the size of the RCP in records,
                               | "x" is either "F" for floppy systems or "H"
                               | for fixed disk systems, and "y" is "C" if the
                               | new command line editor shell is included.
                               | You probably won't want to download all of
                               | the .ZRL modules. See Z34RCP11.LBR for source

9SETIOP.LBR      14976  06-07-93  A ZCPR3 system utility for those who don't	SETIOP.LBR
                               | want to put IOP intercept code in their BIOS.
                               | SETIOP installs the intercept vectors after
                               | LDR has loaded the IOP into place. Until the
                               | vectors are installed, the BIOS uses its own
                               | I/O routines and makes NO reference to the
                               | IOP. Saves space in BIOS, and may be
                               | necessary for those who can't modify their
                               | BIOS. Contains a standard DUMMY IOP with
                               | discussion of the principles.

9SYSENV2.LBR      4992  06-07-93  This is a upgrade for SYSENV that is specific	SYSENV2.LBR
                               | for ZCPR34. It also supports the Extended
                               | TCAP that Joe Wright did for WS4 and ZCPR33.
                               | Note that the values included in the SYSENV
                               | and the included Z3base fit my SB180 system.
                               | I gave credit for this to Jay, but any
                               | mistakes in it are mine. Steve Mendelson
9SYSIOP21.LBR    47616  06-07-93  Sysiop21.lbr was released by the original	SYSIOP21.LBR
                               | author of sysiop2 (Edi Cram p) shortly after
                               | his original release, and fixes several bugs
                               | in the original version and adds more
                               | facilities.

0Z33RCPLT.LIB     5504  06-07-93  This very slightly modified file is from the	Z33RCPLT.LIB
                               | Z33RCP.LBR. The TYPE command no longer allows
                               | control characters to be sent to the screen.
                               | The control characters in WordStar files
                               | sometimes cause problems on my terminal. In
                               | particular, lines ending in soft hyphens were
                               | double spaced, which caused the top lines to
                               | scroll off before the page pause. If you have
                               | similar problems, this is for you.
9Z34RCP11.LBR   109568  06-07-93  Z-System Resident Command Package (RCP) in	Z34RCP11.LBR
                               | source code form, version 1.1. Complete Z80

                               | for ZCPR versions 3.3 and above. Adds several
                               | exciting new commands and features and fixes
                               | various bugs in the previous release. See
                               | companion file RCPZRL11.LBR for pre-compiled
                               | RCP modules which may be loaded with NZ-COM,

9Z3KEY14.LBR     67072  06-07-93  Z3KEY14.LBR is a general cleanup of the code	Z3KEY14.LBR
                               | and reorginization for easier installation.
                               | The Z3KEYRCP.Z80 code has been modified for
                               | the ZASM.COM assembler which is included in
                               | the library so everyone will have the right
                               | assembler. The Z3KEY.COM utility is now self
                               | installing for the environment descriptor.
