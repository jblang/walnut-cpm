             ZSDOS PROGRAMMER'S MANUAL NOW AVAILABLE
                         17 September 90


If you are using a CP/M 2.2 machine and have not yet taken advan- 
tage  of ZSDOS, you are missing out on one of the  most  exciting 
developments  the  CP/M world has seen in  recent  years.   ZSDOS 
replaces  the  BDOS (Basic Disk Operating System)  of  CP/M  2.2, 
adding many features "left out" of CP/M 2.2, including:

          - file datestamping (built-in or modular)

          - Public and Path file access

          - automatic login of changed diskettes

          - Fast Relog of fixed disks

ZSDOS is also more efficient than original CP/M, and corrects all 
known  flaws in the BDOS portion of that disk  operating  system.  
The  ZSDOS  package costs $75 (less if you  currently  own  ZRDOS 
and/or  your  user's  group is part of  Z-Plan),  features  menu-
driven,  user-friendly  installation,  is  compatible  with   any 
standard  CP/M 2.2 system, and includes real time  clock  support 
for  over  forty computer brands.  It also  includes  a  150-page 
User's Manual and twenty-three programs to help you get the  most 
from  your new operating system.  For more information on  ZSDOS, 
contact one of the agents listed at the end of this file, or  see 
the file ZSDOS.AD being distributed over CP/M bulletin boards.

Our  original  intention  of publishing  the  ZSDOS  Programmer's 
Manual  as part of the ZSDOS User's Manual was scratched when  we 
discovered  that  together the two manuals amounted to  over  200 
pages  of text.  Rather than raise the purchase cost of ZSDOS  or 
remove  sections  from  the  manuals, we  decided  to  offer  the 
Programmer's  Manual  as a supplement soon after the  release  of 
ZSDOS  1.0.   Well,  that was nearly two  years  ago.   We  don't 
pretend that we spent ALL of that time drafting the  Programmer's 
Manual,  but a good deal of care has gone into checking  and  re-
checking  the text for completeness, clarity, and  accuracy.   If 
you are programming for the ZSDOS environment, you will find this 
manual essential.  If you are using ZSDOS you may want to  obtain 
the  Programmer's Manual as a further source of  technical  data.  
And  even  if  you do not currently own ZSDOS, you  may  want  to 
obtain  this  manual  for the wealth of  general  information  it 
includes about CP/M protocols.

The ZSDOS Programmer's Manual includes:

   - 2 page Table of Contents;

   - 59  pages of text, diagrams, and tables, including  in-depth 
     coverage  of  BDOS functions, ZSDOS data  structures,  ZSDOS 
     programming conventions, and ZSDOS function calls;

   - four  Quick  Reference pages detailing ZSDOS and  CP/M  BIOS 
     function numbers, input parameters, and returned values;

   - 3 page Index with over 200 entries.

The  manual  is  printed in the convenient 8.5 x  5.5  inch  form 
factor  using  multiple  proportional  fonts  and  line  graphics 
wherever possible for clarity and attractiveness.  It comes  with 
a heavy cardstock cover and is pre-punched for use with  standard 
"IBM" style documentation binders.

The 59 pages of text include a complete description of the  ZSDOS 
interface and much previously unavailable "inside" information on 
the design and operation of CP/M 2.2.  ZSDOS data structures such 
as  the File Control Block and Directory Record are described  in 
detail with attention to distinctions between the different vari- 
eties  of CP/M BDOS replacements now in use.  Extensive  coverage 
of  ZSDOS  programming conventions includes complete  details  on 
reentrant ZSDOS calls, the Error Vector table, the Path and Wheel 
addresses,  the Flags configuration byte, date vectors, and  time 
and date support routines.  Descriptions of ZSDOS function  calls 
present  the system interface in highly readable form, and  offer 
many  timesaving programming notes and cross-references to  other 
BDOS functions.  In addition, each function description  includes 
a Z80 code fragment illustrating typical usage of the  particular 
function.

In  short, we feel that we have put together what will become  an 
"essential"  reference piece not only for ZSDOS programmers,  but 
for  CP/M programmers in general.  And while this manual  is  not 
intended  as a complete tutorial on the CP/M operating system  or 
assembly  language, it is written in a style that makes  much  of 
the  information accessible even to those without  a  programming 
background.
