                 DSB-8100 Product Specification

The   DSB-8100   is  a  small  but   powerful   general   purpose 
microcomputer  useful for a wide variety of  communication,  data 
acquisition  and  data  processing tasks.   The  64180  processor 
executes a superset of the Z80 instruction set allowing it to run 
any  of the wide variety of CP/M programs available.   Assemblers 
are  available specifically for the 64180 and a variety  of  high 
level  languages  such as Basic, C, Pascal, and others  are  also 
available.

The  basic  clock  rate of the 64180 is 6.144  MHz  but  executes 
faster than an 8 MHz Z80H because it requires fewer clock  cycles 
to  complete most instructions.  Two on-chip DMA channels can  be 
used for memory to memory and memory to/from I/O data transfers.

Memory  consists  of  256 kilobytes of dynamic RAM  and  a  JEDEC 
bytewide  memory  socket accepting devices up to  32k.   The  RAM 
array  consists  of  eight 256k by 1 150ns dynamic  RAMs  and  is 
directly accessed through the memory manageement unit integral to 
the 64180.  The bytewide memory socket is preconfigured for an 8k 
x 8 device (2764) with a strapping option allowing larger  memory 
devices if required.

Two RS-232C serial channels are internal to the 64180 and  handle 
asynchronous  communications up to 38,400 bps with one  handshake 
line  on  the  console  port and three  handshake  lines  on  the 
auxiliary  communications port.  Two 10-pin (2x5)  headers  allow 
the DSB-8100 to be connected with straight ribbon cables  through 
a  DE9  (IBM  PC/AT)  type connector  to  most  types  of  serial 
peripheral devices.

The  standard Centronics-type parallel printer port  is  provided 
with  a  26-pin header for connection to a ribbon cable,  and  is 
compatible with the IBM 26/36 pin cable.

The  floppy  disk interface uses the Western Digital  1773  (1793 
code-compatible)  and  supports  3.5, 5.25 and  8  inch  diskette 
drives, single or double-sided, 48 or 96 tpi, single (FM)  and/or 
double (MFM) density.

A  SCSI (Small Computer Systems Interface) port, supported  by  a 
5380 device, is provided to connect the DSB-8100 to a  Winchester 
disk drive or other SCSI-compatible peripheral device(s).

The DSB-8100 was designed to fit in an enclosure alongside a  3.5 
inch  drive.   Dimensions  are  3.875  x  6.750  inches.    Power 
requirements are +5v @ 1.2a and +12v @ 20ma. (-12v for RS-232C in 
generated on-board)
