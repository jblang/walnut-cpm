
                            DEADLINE: June 10th!!!


    I'm running out of room for stuff in the storage unit, so this 
    equipment either goes out to some eager users, or ( I hate to say 
    this..) it goes to Goodwill. Make me an offer--just any offer. See 
    terms at the end of this message    :<
