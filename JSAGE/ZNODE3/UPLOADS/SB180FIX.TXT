This was from a message from Ken Davidson of MicroMint originally
posted on the Circuit Celler BBS in 1986 and was corrected on Feb.
23/87. The purpose of this fix is to allow hardware hand-shaking
between the SB180 (original) and a terminal. I did it when the msg.
was first posted and found that it fixed most of the problems I had
running at 19200.

1) Change JP4 and JP5 so that the DCD receiver is used with the CTS
line instead of the DCD. Find JP4 and JP5 on your board and cut the
traces on the back that are hard-wiring those jumpers. Then install
pins in the holes and place removeable jumpers in the following
positions:

              JP4 O---O   O---O   O      O---O   O JP5

2) Since most terminals use DTR (pin 20) instead of CTS (pin 4) for
hand-shaking, you must make a special cable that swaps pin 4 and 20.

3) Finally, configure your terminal to use DTR hand-shaking.

Since the hand-shaking is done in hardware, it is totally
transparent to the software.

Note if you are using Malcolm Kemp's XBIOS tell it in the RS232
configuration area that you are using DTR hand-shaking. Steve
