9BDSCPAT.LBR      5248  06-07-93  There is a bug in BDS C 1.6 and BDS Z 2.0	BDSCPAT.LBR
                               | that causes the system to crash under certain
                               | conditions during the second pass of a
                               | compile. Here's a fix.
9C128-XGR.LBR     4096  06-07-93  C128-XGR.LBR contains a new Z3 Termcap for	C128-XGR.LBR
                               | the Commodore 128 with C128 line graphics.
                               | Programs like ZDT12+ will print line graphic
                               | boxes. Underline, blink and reverse
                               | attributes are also available. The 50 ms CL
                               | delay was removed, since the 128 doesn't seem
                               | to need it. Randy Winchester, 9/22/92.
9C128TCAP.LBR     2048  06-07-93  An extended TCAP for the C-128, this	C128TCAP.LBR
                               | implements many of the extended functions,
                               | including simple ASCII characters for the
                               | graphics. The TCSRC13-generated source file
                               | has the labels CM:, RC: and GE: changed,
                               | since RMAC doesn't like them.
9CLKMNT11.LBR     3072  06-07-93  Are you tired of having to manually change	CLKMNT11.LBR
                               | the year on your Kenmore clock every January
                               | 1st, or fix the day-of-the-week after the
                               | 29th of February? CLOCKMNT eliminates both
                               | these annoyances. All you have to do is run
                               | it when you start up your system, or just
                               | after midnight each day on your BBS. The base
                               | address of the clock may be changed as
                               | required. Version 1.1 runs independently of
                               | DOS. See CLOCKMNT.Z80 for details.
9CLOCK22.LBR     47104  06-07-93  A program to set/read the MM58167 clock chip	CLOCK22.LBR
                               | used by the Kenmore clock and the Anapro or
                               | CDR Super RAM H89 clock for the H89. Adjusts
                               | the clock for leap year and Daylight Savings
                               | Time. Use the CFG file to set the base port.
                               | Under ZCPR3 has option to show elapsed time
                               | or if an H19 terminal put time on the 25th
                               | line(Heath/ANSI mode). May work for other
                               | terminals (use CFG file). Biff Bueffel
                               | 3/24/93
9CMP30.LBR       15360  06-07-93  This program compares two text or two binary	CMP30.LBR
                               | files. It displays differences in hex and in
                               | character format. You may advance either file
                               | by a single byte or attempt to resynchronize
                               | the files based on a string. Runs under both
                               | CP/M and Z-System. Written in BDS Z. - Lee
                               | Bradley - 11/25/92
9CODER2.LBR      18816  06-07-93  Coder is an encryption program which will	CODER2.LBR
                               | encode an ASCII file, making it unreadable to
                               | all except those with the proper pass-code.
                               | The use for such a program? Perhaps you keep
                               | a personal journal on your computer which may
                               | contain items of a very personal or
                               | embarrassing nature. Maybe you have a need
                               | for truly 'private' E-Mail. In general, good
                               | for any item you wish to remain private or
                               | share only with selected others.
9COMM122.LBR     41856  06-07-93  GREAT X/Y/ZMODEM and ANSI/VT52/TVI950	COMM122.LBR
                               | terminal emulator from Germany for Z3PLUS
                               | ONLY. The docs and the menus are in German,
                               | but it is very easy to use. Includes all of
                               | the above and popup windows in just over 25k.
                               | Installable with ZCNFG (the CFG file is in
                               | English) U/L by Brian Moore, 01/03/93
9CON20.LBR       19328  06-07-93  Joe Wright's very fast file concatenation	CON20.LBR
                               | program. Nothing fancy, but FAST!! Not a Z
                               | utility.
9CONCTRL.LBR      3840  06-07-93  Another approach to throttling the screen	CONCTRL.LBR
                               | output of ZCPR3 systems, concocted some time

                               | Bruce Morgen 09/07/90
0CPMT-PCP.NUM     1152  06-07-93  Phone numbers for several boards that	CPMT-PCP.NUM
                               | originated CP/M-Tech echo messages that
                               | should be reachable via PC Pursuit. I called
                               | some of them and at least a modem answered. I
                               | didn't go any further though. Larry Schnitger
9CPMT0315.LBR    54656  06-07-93  Several CP/M-Tech echo capture sessions dated	CPMT0315.LBR
                               | Mar 10 to 15.

                               | (617) 729-7340.
9CPMUNARJ.ARK    24064  06-07-93  Official release version of Paul Hunt's CP/M	CPMUNARJ.ARK
                               | program to handle .ARJ files. Also included
                               | is DARJ to display the complete directory of
                               | an ARJ, as well as the DOC's for both.
9CPROT.LBR        5120  06-07-93  CPROT is a simple utility for use in	CPROT.LBR
                               | debugging programs such as operating system
                               | modules and type 3 Z system utilities which
                               | must be protected from overlay by a debugger.
                               | CPROT creates "protected" memory above a
                               | specifed address by creating a double jump to
                               | CP/M DOS starting with the DOS jump at 05h.
                               | The jump vector at 06h addresses a jump to
                               | DOS at a user specified address. CPROT makes
                               | several checks to prevent overwriting op sys
                               | or itself. Sources included
9CRCBLD14.LBR    20352  06-07-93  I've used this utility for a long time to	CRCBLD14.LBR
                               | write SIG/M-type catalog files to my archival
                               | disks, but it was never released. Possibly
                               | somebody else will find it useful, so here it
                               | is. Based on SIG/M's CRCBUILD, this ZCPR3
                               | version recognizes DU and DIR specs, obtains
                               | the disk number automatically from the disk
                               | label (if one exists), sets the error flag,
                               | and is compatible with automatic CRC checking
                               | using CRCZ.
9CRR0150A.ZIP    57344  06-07-93  CRR is the CP/M offline reader for use	CRR0150A.ZIP
                               | anywhere XRS might be used on an MSDOS
                               | machine. It allows you to download messages
                               | from a conformin QBBS, RemoteAccess or
                               | SuperBBS Fidonet bulletin board. It will work
                               | a with QWK mail packers. In order to use this
                               | software you will need an archiving program
                               | (eg. ARK or ARC), an archive extractor (eg.
                               | UNARC), and a text editor (eg. VDE or ZDE).
9CTLCV11B.LBR    18688  06-07-93  CTRLCVT is a filter which takes files with	CTLCV11B.LBR
                               | control characters represented as ^C, ^M,
                               | etc., and changes the two character sequence
                               | into a bonafide control character. As an
                               | improvement to CTLCV10A, this version will
                               | take advantage of ZCPR 3.3's extended error
                               | handling capability, telling the handler what
                               | went wrong.
9DATA17.LBR      46208  06-07-93  This is a "Poor Man's Database Management	DATA17.LBR
                               | System." It supports all traditional features
                               | of a database management system including

                               | list etc. You can even password protect your
                               | data. Written in MBASIC and compiled with
                               | BASCOM. This release fixes a bug pointed out
                               | by Mike Finn, adds several new features and
                               | corrects several problems. - Lee Bradley -

9DATEFN11.LBR    16256  06-07-93  DATEFN (Dated Filename) is a simple ZCPR3	DATEFN11.LBR
                               | utility that reads the DOS clock and creates
                               | or optionally deletes an empty label file
                               | with the current date as the filename. The
                               | filename date format may be configured with
                               | ZCNFG as ?ddMMMyy.typ or mm/dd/yy.typ. Useful
                               | in backup aliases to create and remove label
                               | filenames automatically indicating the date
                               | of the last disk backup or as a dated library
                               | file entry. See DATEFN11.HZP.
9DATENULL.ARK     4352  06-07-93  This is an RSX that adds a DOS function to	DATENULL.ARK
                               | CP/M-Plus that allows limited setting of file
                               | date stamps. This is a first cut and needs
                               | further development.

9DIALER.LBR       9088  06-07-93  DIALER is a simple Z-System utility that	DIALER.LBR
                               | allows your computer and Hayes-compatible
                               | modem to dial your voice telephone calls.
                               | It's particularly helpful for scripting your
                               | way through banking and other touch-tone
                               | based response systems, but could be combined
                               | with other Z-System tools to implement a
                               | phone number directory, among other potential
                               | uses. Type 3 (@100h) and Type 4 versions
                               | included, both well under 2K.
9DIF13.LBR       29568  06-07-93  Compares two text files for differences and	DIF13.LBR
                               | offers several forms of output via command

                               | The ZCPR3 program error flag is set on error
                               | or if the two files do not match. DIF should
                               | run fine under vanilla CP/M, but piping is
                               | available only under ZCPR3. Version 1.3
                               | corrects bug in LST: and NUL: output
                               | redirection.
9DIO21.LBR       14080  06-07-93  A revised DIO package for the Z version of	DIO21.LBR
                               | BDS C. Works like the old one, but adds
                               | additional Unix-like redirected output
                               | options, including appending with ">>",
                               | output to printer or bit-bucket, and piping
                               | that will use all the Z resources, including
                               | the path, ARUNZ, and LX. All but piping still
                               | works under vanilla CP/M.

9REVFN11.LBR     16512  06-07-93  REVFN reverses the case of a filename, making	REVFN11.LBR
                               | it upper-case if it's lower, lower-case if
                               | it's upper. Written primarily to allow the
                               | renaming of lower-case disk labels created by
                               | DSKNUM, REVFN may also be useful to convert

                               | collection and sent them to DHN* RCP/M to
                               | continue to make them acessible to the CP/M
                               | community and we are in debt to Bob.
                               | Cataloging is underway by an informal group
                               | of interested parties, for eventual complete

9RS232TS2         7168  06-07-93  7168 reads the status byte from an RS232	RS232TS2
                               | control port and places it in ZCPR3 user
                               | register 8. Registers 0 through 7 contain
                               | either 1 or 0, depending on bits of the
                               | status byte. Optional wheel protec-tion and
                               | I/O port selection are set by patching well
                               | marked bytes in the first sector of the
                               | program. If RS232TST is wheel protected and
                               | if the wheel byte is reset, RS232TST returns
                               | an error code 6, making it effectively
                               | invisible to non-wheels.

                               | both the Micromint BIOS and XBIOS. In
                               | addition, SWZ will display the SmartWatch
                               | time once or continuously, and optionally
                               | allows setting the time on Wyse and TeleVideo

9T12.LBR         24704  06-07-93  T12 is a modified version of ZLT12 that	T12.LBR
                               | defaults to no paging, does not print a
                               | header at top of file, and sends all
                               | characters (including control characters) to
                               | the console. It is for using screen display
                               | files such as those terrific displays done by
                               | Rick Charnes, but T12 allows DU and DIR specs
                               | and squeezed, crunched, and LZH files in
                               | libraries. Thanks Rick!
