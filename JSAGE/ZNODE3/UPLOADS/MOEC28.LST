--MORE--(2%)[ $Revision: 2.8 $; last updated 20 March 1992 ]

Here is my list of companies which will sell electronic components in
small quantities.  Most of these places I have bought from, a couple
I haven't.  Being a ham radio operator, I am most interested in
RF components, and in particular, air variable capacitors, which tend to be
scarce (and tend to be used or surplus even if I've otherwise labelled the
seller as "NEW").  I apologize in advance for disparaging remarks about
what happens when parts suppliers start selling computers, but anyone who
has watched Jameco over the years will know just what I mean (though
their latest catalog hints at possibly returning to selling parts).

Categories are:
NEW COMPONENTS  Distributors and sellers of new components, or "new and some
        used" in a couple of cases.
SURPLUS ELECTRONICS     Usually overstocks, occasionally used equipment.
        Ideal for stocking the junkbox, usually have dependable stock lines
        of resistors, capacitors, and some semiconductors, but won't have
        those LCD modules forever...  An invaluable resource, don't shy away
        from them.
SPECIALTY COMPONENTS    In particular, crystals and toroidal cores.
KITS    Ham radio kits, random electronic kits, whatever they have.
LITTLE GUYS     Separated out because of some twisted sentimentality,
        I suppose.  Intended to honor one or two ham spare-bedroom
        operations.
PUBLICATIONS    Two publications which are essentially all want-ads, plus
        the address for SAMS PHOTOFACTS because everyone always asks about
        it on sci.electronics.

Note on shipping costs:  I don't always update these frequently enough, and
they're generally for continental US unless otherwise mentioned.

NEW COMPONENTS:

Ocean State Electronics

chokes & coils, B&W coils, RF switches, Millen variable capacitors, lots of
parts in general.  Send $1 for the catalog.

Scottsdale AZ 85271-3047
(800) 528-1417
No minimum with check or money order, $15 otherwise.  $3 S&H.
New electronics, good RF assortment, increasing infestation of computers.

Mouser Electronics      Mouser Electronics      Mouser Electronics
  11433 Woodside Ave.   2401 Highway 287 North  12 Emery Ave.
  Santee CA 92071       Mansfield TX 76063      Randolf NJ 07869
Mouser Electronics
  370 Tomkins Court
  Gilroy CA 95020
Catalog Subscriptions:  (800) 992-9943 (Continental US only)
Sales & Service:        (800) 34-MOUSER (800-346-6873) (US, Puerto R., Canada)
Very complete catalog of brand-new components (though no air variables).
Usually quick service, $20 "minimum" ($5 charge under $20).  When ordering,
you may want to be sure to ask about availability and shipping locations;
they have several warehouses, and frequently orders will get sent from several
warehouses (which drives up the shipping costs).

Digi-Key
701 Brooks Ave. South
P.O.Box 677
Thief River Falls, MN 56701-0677
1-800-DIGI-KEY
No minimum, $5 handling under $25, free and very complete catalog, very nice
indeed.  Prices aren't always the best, but rarely excessive.  Weak on RF
specialty parts (though they now have the ever-popular NE602N), but they do
have blue LEDs.

Active Electronics
11 Cummings Park
Woburn MA 01801
(800)-677-8899 (US)
(800)-363-6592 (Canada)
$25 minimum, $5 S&H UPS, free catalog.  They have 8 stores in the US
(Santa Clara CA; Chicago IL; Baltimore MD; Woburn MA; Detroit MI;
Mt. Laurel NJ; Long Island NY; Seattle WA) and 9 stores in Canada
(Quebec City; Montreal (2); Ottawa; Mississuaga; Winnipeg; Calgary;
Edmonton; Vancouver BC).  Lots of stuff, oriented more toward supplying
last-minute requirements of companies than hobbyists, but perfectly happy
to take your money in small doses (stores have no minimum order or
shipping&handling).  Some items in their catalog are subject to a $25 per
ITEM minimum, which is kind of a drag.

Newark Electronics
 Send catalog requests to:
 Newark Electronics
 ATTENTION CATALOG DEPARTMENT
 4801 N. Ravenswood Ave.
 Chicago IL 60640-4496
 (312) 784-5100
They don't have a single mail address or phone; instead, one is supposed
to call the closest of three pages worth of branch offices.  I don't feel
like typing in the entire list (it's copyrighted, anyway :-), so send email
for your "local" distributor, or call their administrative offices at the
number above.  They have a $25 minimum order; they are a Real Distributor,
but accept small orders (over the minimum, of course).  Their catalog
currently 1248 pages; they are very complete (except, of course, for my
favorite scarce item, the air-variable capacitor).  Note that the catalog
prices tend not to match reality all that often, so order by phone rather
than by mail; prices tend to be higher than other places, but they have a lot
of things that are hard to find from other outlets.

Arrow Electronics, Inc.         Catalog requests to:
Catalog Division                Catalog Division
1860 Smithtown Ave.             25 Hub Drive
Ronkonkoma NY 11779             Melville NY 11747-9828
(800) 93-ARROW
Minimum $25; catalog cover price is $25 but if you convince them you're
with a company they'll probably send one free.  They are a Real Distribitor,
but also didn't mind my placing a personal order.

MCM Electronics
650 Congress Park Drive
Centerville OH 45459-4072
(800) 543-4330
Minimum $20 ($25 for charge cards, and they don't take personal checks),
handling $1.95 + shipping.  Oriented toward repair technicians, really
heavy on VCR parts and somewhat overpriced doodads, lots of useful stuff
not easily found elsewhere.

Fordham Radio Supply
260 Motor Parkway
Hauppauge NY 11788-5134
(800)695-4848
Tools for technicians.  One or two items are not outrageously overpriced.

(800) 237-6948 (FAX)
(415) 592-8097
$30 minimum order (was $50), >$5 shipping & handling.  Their most recent
catalog may have reversed a long trend of abandoning parts in favor of
PC compatibles, or it may not; one can always hope.

JDR Microdevices
2233 Branham Lane
San Jose CA 95124
Orders:         800-538-5000
Cust. Service:  800-538-5001
No minimum, $5+ shipping.  Mostly computers now, but they haven't yet
decided to abandon components; indeed, they recently dropped their minimum
order requirement entirely.

Cupertino CA 95016
(408)257-8614  (408)996-3240

that can be sensibly shipped in a first-class letter, include money for

Surplus electronic gear; oscilloscopes and signal generators from the days
when dinosaurs with vacuum tubes roamed the earth (some solid state gear, but
