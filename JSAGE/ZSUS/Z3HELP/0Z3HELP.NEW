11/18/91               Z3HELP System - Special Notes               Bill Tishey

  A number of authored Help files exceed the 24k size limit required  for them
to be viewed by LBRHLP in crunched form.   These files (ACOPY.HLP,  DSLIB.HLP,
DU3.HLP, MENU.HLP, VMENU.HLP) are therefore provided uncrunched.  The improved
buffer allocation in LBRHLP (since vs 1.4)  allows for  uncrunched  files  24k
larger than that allowed  for  in  previous  versions,  so  these  files  will
display properly.  If you try to crunch them, a "memory overflow" message will
likely result on small-TPA systems.  

  The "Y" library, heretofore unused, now contains authored Help files for the
Z-System Libraries (and related programming routines, modules, etc.).  A brief
file will also exist in the appropriate lettered LBR and refer to the detailed
help in Y.LBR (e.g., SYSLB.HZP will exist in S.LBR and refer to SYSLIB.HZP and
the set of files for SYSLIB vs 4.4 in Y.LBR).   This scheme helps to  organize
all files into a neat 26-LBR set, if you have enough room to handle the larger
Y (264k) and Z (300k) LBRs.   As distributed, Y and Z may be split into Y1, Y2
and Z1, Z2,  depending on your disk format.   Either un-LBR and LPUT the files
into a single Y and Z LBR or otherwise arrange them to suit your disk system.

  In this version,  I didn't tinker with the format of the files,  just worked
to bring the entire system up to date.   Over 100 files were  modified  and  a
half a megabyte added to the size of the package.  Okay, now watch someone put
out a string of utilities beginning with the letter "Y"!    -wat

  VLU has now been split into two separate files.  -wat

   The set of Z3HELP libraries as distributed has one problem worth noting:

     I obtained 'memory overflow' messages in trying to read DU3.HLP, VLU.HLP
     and  VMENU.HLP  as  options  under  DU31.HLP,  VLU1.HLP  and VMENU1.HLP, 
     respectively (I only have a 64k system!).   The uncrunching routines  in 
     LBRHLP use up to 22k of buffer space,  leaving only 25k+ for files,  and 
     these files are larger than 25k.  I will have to look later into a work-
     around (file-splitting?) for this.   

  I will try to issue updates to  the LBRs  periodically,  probably  bundling
them in something like Z3HELP02.LBR, Z3HELP03.LBR, etc.  -wat
