As of 1 January, 1991, The Computer Journal changed hands.
Chris McEwen, one of the Z-SUS partners, has assumed the
position of editor and publisher from Art Carlson. He assures
all that TCJ's traditional CP/M and Z-System support will
continue.

If you find these articles of value to you, then you should
certainly subscribe to The Computer Journal. Published six
times per year, it remains the CP/M and Z-System world's
finest publication. A subscription costs $18 per year within
the US, and $24 for all other countries (surface shipment).
