Note:

Files with a 'Z' in the middle position of the file extension
(example: Z3WORD.CZT) have been compressed with CRUNCH28.  This
has been done to provide more information than the disk would
normally hold.

In order to read the information, you must decompress the files
first. Move them to a disk with plenty of free space and enter:

        UNCR <filename.ezt>

A copy of UNCR28 has been provided in case you do not have it.
