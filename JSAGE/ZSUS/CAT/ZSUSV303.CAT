   CCOUNT counts characters in text files.   It reports both the  total number
   of characters and  counts  for  characters  specified  on the command line.
   Optionally,  CCOUNT  can  report  individual  counts  for  all  characters,
   including control characters, and can ignore high bits or not.  Counting is
   done via 32-bit integers.  Both ZCPR3 and vanilla CP/M are supported.

   CPD is a ZCPR3 utility to compare two directories and indicate  which files
   are in both directories and which are only in one.   Matched  or  unmatched
   filenames can be output to a disk file.  CPD supports both upper- or lower-
   case display,  sets the error flag if directories don't match,  and can set
   the archive attribute on files which exist in  both  directories.   Vs  1.5
   fixes a rather serious bug.

   FL creates file lists on disk for use by other  programs.   Multiple ambig-
   uous file specifications, including a negative specification, may be given.
   Matching filenames are written to a disk file.  Optionally, the DU in which
   the file is located can be  included  with  the  filename in the disk file.
   The error flag is set if no matching files are found.

   wheel protection,  and  runs under vanilla CP/M.   Version  1.4  corrects a
