    This file will be used to notify users of  any  problems  which  have been
reported with programs in our distribution.   Although  we  are doing our best
to include only stable and tested  versions  of  programs,  even  the  authors
cannot guarantee there are no lingering bugs  (nor can they anticipate all the
situations and  uses  to  which  their  creations  might  be  subjected).   As
distributors, we cannot  be  held  responsible  for  any  damage  which  these
programs might incur.  We owe it to you, however, to report any problems which 
come to our attention.


   ACOPY.COM vs 3.0  (ZSUSV103)  -  Problems  have  been  confirmed  with disk
caching when directories exceed  256  entries.   This  can  cause considerable
damage to a hard disk system.  Vs 3.2 (ZSUSV204) will contain the fix.

   BUSH.COM vs 0.0b  (Z3COM package)  -  A recent  user  reports  that, during
Restore, the temporary file  continues to  build and the operation aborts when
disk space is exhausted.  This problem, as yet, is unconfirmed.
