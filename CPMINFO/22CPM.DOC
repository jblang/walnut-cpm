*      Register   C:   25H          *

*************************************


The RESET DRIVE function allows resetting of specified drive(s).
The passed parmeter is a 16 bit vector of drives to be reset;
the least significant bit is drive A.

In order to maintain compatibility with MP/M, CP/M returns a
zero value.





*************************************
*  FUNCTION 40:   WRITE RANDOM WITH 
*                    ZERO FILL      *
*************************************
*  Entry Parameters:                *
*      Register   C:   28H          *
*      Register  DE:   FCB Address  *
*  Returned Value  :                *
*      Register   A:   Return Code  *
************************************


The WRITE RANDOM WITH ZEROFILL operation is similar to
FUNCTION 34;  with the exception that a previously unallocated
block is filled with zeros before the data is written.

DIGITAL RESEARCH CP/M [R] 2.2 FIELD SOFTWARECHANGE
         Copyright (c) 1980   Digital Research

ID# CPM22-0001    PROGRAM: BDOS     ISSUE DATE: 02/19/80


ERROR DESCRIPTION:  The following change affects only those CP/M
systems which are using the optional blocking and deblocking al-
gorithms listed in Appendix G of the CP/M Alteratio Guide.  If
you are in doubt as to the applicability of this field change,
please contact Digital Reearch or your CP/M distributor.

PATCH PROCEDURE:  Ensure you have an archive copy of the distri-
buted MOVCPM.COM file.  Make changes to a version of MOVCPM>COM
by carefully following the steps shown below:  MOVCPM.COM is
loaded into memory using DDTand the changes are mde using the
Assemble (A) and Set (S) commands.  After making the changes,
return to the console command processor usig the Go (G) command,
and SAVE the altered memory image on disk. The memory image on
tracks 0 and 1 must also be updated.  This can be accomplished
by executing the new MOVCPM program, as described in the CP/M
Alteration Guide, and integrating your customized I/O system.

NOTE:  This Field Software change is not installed in the CP/M
version 2.2.  It must be installed in all systems which ue the
deblocking algorithms listed in Appendix G of the CP/M Alteration
Guied.
