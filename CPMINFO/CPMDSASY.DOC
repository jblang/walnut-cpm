Re:   CP/M Disassembly

Didn't mean to imply in my previous message that it was I who was
doing the disassembly; actually, it's Clark Calkins (C.C. Software,
2564 Walnut Blvd. #106, Walnut Creek, CA 94598) -- he's the guy
who sells MP/C, a disassembly of CP/M 2.2 (reviewed by Pournelle in
the Sept. 83 Byte).  He sent me the CCP, and figured he'd have the
banked and resident BDOS disassemblies in early March (at the time, he
was about 80% through the disassembly), so I should hear from him Real
Soon Now; he plans to sell the whole package for $55, which has to be
the bargain of the year (his 2.2 disassembly was $29, the bargain of
last year).  The way this thing works is that you have your CCP.COM,
RESBDOS.SPR, and BNKBDOS.SPR files on the logged-in drive, and his
program disassembles them (using encrypted data files he provides with
the package).  Thus, he doesn't violate DR's copyright, since you have
to have the package to get the disassembly.

You might want to give Clark a call, and see if he's selling the
package yet (tell him I sent you).			--Ron
