ID# CPM22-0001    PROGRAM: BDOS     ISSUE DATE: 02/19/80


ERROR DESCRIPTION:  The following change affects only those CP/M
systems which are using the optional blocking and deblocking al-
gorithms listed in Appendix G of the CP/M Alteration Guide.  If
you are in doubt as to the applicability of this field change,
please contact Digital Research or your CP/M distributor.

PATCH PROCEDURE:  Ensure you have an archive copy of the distri-
buted MOVCPM.COM file.  Make changes to a version of MOVCPM>COM
by carefully following the steps shown below:  MOVCPM.COM is
loaded into memory using DDT and the changes are made using the
Assemble (A) and Set (S) commands.  After making the changes,
return to the console command processor using the Go (G) command,
and SAVE the altered memory image on disk.  The memory image on
tracks 0 and 1 must also be updated.  This can be accomplished
by executing the new MOVCPM program, as described in the CP/M
Alteration Guide, and integrating your customized I/O system.
