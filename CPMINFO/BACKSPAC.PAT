Subject: CP/M 2.2 patch for backspace

New patch to CP/M V2.2 BDOS.  Causes both <DEL> and
<BS> to be treated like a <BS>, i.e, to echo a
<BS> instead of the character.  Patch this into your
BIOS source code:
 
        ORG     CCP+0A1BH
        JMP     CCP+0A07H
        DB      0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0         

NOPs to keep it pretty.

Thats all there is to it!
