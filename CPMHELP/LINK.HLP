:LINK:
        The linker is used to link assembled, Compiled programs modules
together, load them into memory, and begin execution if desired.  The
program modules can come from different sources  Some of the sources are
          BASCOM
          COBOL
          FORTRAN
          ASSEMBLER
          RPG
          
:LINK:
    The format for the involk of Linker is


   LINK <filename1.ext/s,filename2.ext/s,....>

    where   filename stands for   Disk drive letter followed by a colon
                     followed by the absolute file name

            ext  is used if the module extension is different than .rel
            
            /s   stands for switch options.
  EXAMPLE of a link

     LINK MAIN,FORLIB/S,MAIN/N/G/E

      The first MAIN is the name of the module from the fortran compiler
      The FORLIB/S  is the library of standard fortran routines that will
           be selected
      The MAIN/N/G/E  means to name the .COM file MAIN and to save it on
           current disk then execute MAIN automatically.

                          SWITCH OPTIONS

    Each switch option is preceded by a /

    E ....  Exit to operating system
    
    G ....  Go   start execution
          Start execution of the program as soon as the current command
          line has been interpreted.

    M ....  Map all symbols
          List both all the defined globals and their values and all 
          undefined globals followed by an asterisk.

    R ....  Reset the linker
          Puts the linker back to its initial state.   the /R is used
          to restart LINK if the wrong file was loaded by mistake.

    S ....  Search file
          Search the disk file having the filename immediately preceding
          the /S in the command string, to satisfy any undefined globals.
          This is convenient for having the linker search a library file
          of musch-used routines.

    U ....  List all undefined globals
          List all undefined globals as soon as the current command line
          has been interpreted and executed.  Link defaults to this 
          switch; therefore it is generally not needed.
