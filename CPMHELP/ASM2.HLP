:Invoking the Assembler

     The CP/M Assembler is invoked by typing --

          ASM filename   or   ASM filename.parms

where 'filename' is the name of the file 'filename.ASM' to be assembled.

     In the case of the first command, the following files are created --

          filename.HEX        - "HEX" file containing machine code in
                                Intel hex format
          filename.PRN        - listing file


     In  the case of the second command,  these files are created according 
to the parameters specified --

          ASM filename.pqr

where
          p : A,B,...  - designates the disk name which contains the source
          q : A,B,...  - designates the disk name to receive the hex file
              Z        - skips generation of the hex file
          r : A,B,...  - designates the disk name which will receive the
                         print file
              X        - outputs the listing to the console
              Z        - skips generation of the print file

     D    Data error:  element in data statement cannot be  placed  in  the 
          specified data area
     E    Expression  error:   expression   is  ill-formed  and  cannot  be 
          computed at assembly line

     L    Label  error:   label  cannot  appear in  this  context  (may  be 
          duplicate label)
     N    Not  implemented:   features  which  will appear  in  future  ASM 
          versions

     O    Overflow:  expression is too complicated to compute; simplify
     P    Phase  error:   label  does  not  have  the  same  value  on  two 
          subsequent passes through the program

     R    Register  error:   the  value  specified as  a  register  is  not 
          compatible with the operation code
     V    Value  error:  operand  encountered in expression  is  improperly 
          formed
:Assembler Console Error Messages

     NO SOURCE FILE PRESENT        The file specified in the ASM command
                                   does not exist on disk

     NO DIRECTORY SPACE            The disk directory is full, erase files
                                   which are not needed, and retry

     SOURCE FILE NAME ERROR        Improperly formed ASM file name

     SOURCE FILE READ ERROR        Source file cannot be read properly by
                                   the assembler, execute a TYPE to
                                   determine the point of error

     OUTPUT FILE WRITE ERROR       Output files cannot be written properly,
                                   most likely cause is a full disk, erase
                                   and retry

     CANNOT CLOSE FILE             Output file cannot be closed, check to
                                   see if disk is write protected
