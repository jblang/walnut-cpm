:UNCR  [d:]<afn>  [d:]   [/Q | /V | /C]

where  [d:]<afn> is any filename (with optional drive spec).  The second    
       [d:] is an optional drive specifier  where  the  output  will  be
       directed.  If either "d:" is not specified, the default  (logged)
       drive will be used.  All input & output takes place in  the  cur-
       rent user area.
 
       Note that the resulting filename will be recreated from the  name
       of the file that was originally crunched.
 
       It  is not necessary that the file to be uncrunched have  "Z"  as
       the  middle letter of the extension; an attempt will be  made  to
       uncrunch  any filename explicitly specified.  Note  however  that
       "UNCR *.*" will be internally converted to "UNCR *.?Z?" to facil-
       itate quickly uncrunching all crunched files in a mixed group.

UNCR  [d:]<afn>  [d:]   [/Q | /V | /C]

       Three  command line options, "/Q", "/V" or "/C",  are  available.
       If  used, the option should be last on the command line, and  the
       "/" must be preceded by a space. Only one option may be selected.
 
       "/Q"  and  "/V" will "quiet down" a version of UNCR    which  has
       been  configured to be "verbose", or cause a "verbose" run  of  a
       program  normally configured to be "quiet".  This relates to  the
       amount of information sent to the console.
 
       "/C", the confirm option,  is  used  for  selective  uncrunching.
       When used in conjunction with wildcard  filespecs,  this  option
       causes the program to ask "Y/N" for each matching file. Only  the
       files to which "Y" is responded will  be  uncrunched.   Selecting
       this option causes the program to  automatically  ask  for  added
       confirmation  if a pre-existing file is about to be  overwritten,
       regardless of the program's configuration.
