The complete FogScan set currently includes seven disks:
   Disk 01 contains Claude Ostyn's program (both the CP/M and MS/PC-DOS 
           versions) and the documentation. In addition, if there is
           sufficient space, there are sample data files.
   Disk 02 contains the description data file for the CP/M section of the 
           library (FOG-CPM.DTA).
   Disk 03 contains part one of the descriptions of the MS/PC-DOS section 
           of the library (FOG-DOS1.DTA). 
   Disk 04 contains part two of the descriptions of the MS/PC-DOS section 
           of the library (FOG-DOS2.DTA). 
   Disk 05 contains data files with key word, title and author names of the 
           Foglight issues (volumes 1 through 4) AND the key word, company
           name, product or service, address and phone number of Vendors.
   Disk 06 contains data files with key word, title and author names of the 
           five Computer HELP issues and the 17 issues of Portable Companion.
   Disk 07 contains data files with key word, title and author names of the 
           Foghorn volumes 7 (12 issues) and 8 (11 issues)
   Disk 08 contains data files with key word, title and author names of the 
           Foghorn volume 5 (12 issues) AND the key word, company name, 
           product or service, address and phone number of Vendors.
   Disk 09 contains data files with key word, title and author names of the 
           Foghorn volumes 3 (12 issues) and 4 (12 issues)
   Disk 10 contains data files with key word, title and author names of the 
           Foghorn volumes 1 (11 issues) and 2 (12 issues) plus the BEST OF
           VOLUME I and the BEST OF VOLUME II.

Other disks will be added as the data files are created. Updated releases
of these disks will occur on an irregular schedule as members contribute
the necessary information.

Back issue ordering information is included in every issue of the Foghorn.
When back issues are no longer available, it will usually be possible to 
obtain photocopies of desired articles from Fog.

To use the program, just type

		FOGSCANX<cr>
where the "x" represents your operating system ("C" for CP/M systems or 
"D" for MS/PC-DOS) systems.

To use install the program for your system, just type

		SETFGSCD<cr> (for the MS/PC-DOS version)
		SETFGSCC<cr> (for the CP/M version)
and answer the questions. If you elect to rename FOGSCANx, you must install 
it for your system BEFORE renaming the program (unless you simply rename it 
to FOGSCAN.xxx).

FogScan has excellent on-line help, just type "H" or "?" at any prompt. It 
supports both AND and OR searches. Use the supplied setup (SETFGSCC and 
SETFGSCD) programs to configure FogScan for your system.

Because the data files are so large, it is necessary to spread this program 
over several disks and, for some disk formats, multiple data files. When you 
load FOGSCANX, it will show you a list of the data files on the same disk and 
ask which you want. At this point you may change disks (just select one of 
the options -- now wrong -- and FogScan will recognize the change of disks 
and offer new choices).

FogScan is completely held in memory so you can switch data files (and disks) 
as often as you want. It is, however, best to exit the search option before 
swapping disks.

Notice: Please feel free to distribute this disk (but not the actual Fog 
Library Disks) to other computer users. Form an archive file using your 
favorite compression software and upload the files to your favorite 
Remote System. Not only will this help to spread the word about Fog, it 
will help your upload ratio.

        -DISK1.DOC   	This file
        FOGSCANC.COM    (CP/M 80 program - requires 48K tpa)

Merging Data Files
Those who have a hard disk or disks with more than 360K may wish to use any
ASCII text editor (including non-document WordStar) to merge data files.

In the example below, we are merging the FOG-DOS1.DTA and FOG-DOS2.DTA into
a new file called FOG-DOS.DTA. If you don't use a new filename, be sure to 
delete the .IXP and .NDX files. If you forget, FogScan may act a little
strangely until you delete the incorrect index files and create new ones.

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
*                                                                             *
*     Caution: DO NOT MIX data files when the first seven characters of       *
*     the filename are different.  You will not get the correct disk or       *
*     issue number.                                                           *
*                                                                             *
*     Before attempting to merge two data files, check the space each         *
*     requires and double it. If you don't have at least that much space      *
*     availabe, DO NOT ATTEMPT TO MERGE the files.                            *
*                                                                             *
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

To merge the two FOG-DOSx.DTA files:

Check to be sure you have at least 620K of disk space available.

Make a copy of the FOG-DOS1.DTA file under the name FOG-DOS.DTA (omitting the
"1"). Edit the file and immediately go to the end of the file. Read in 
FOG-DOS.DTA. Delete the first three lines of FOG-DOS2.DTA. 

(They will be something like:

Date: August 8, 1990
Title: FOG-DOS Disk Library descriptions (disks 320 through 408).
Version: D2

)

After the deletion, your cursor should be on a question mark. 

Now save the modified data file and exit your text editor.

The final step is to load FogScan. In the absence of matching index files, 
FogScan will ask if you wish to build the new index files. Press <Alt>-<I>
and FogScan will tell you about how long it will take and verify that you
want to build the index files.

It is not necessary that the data files be indexed. Note however that working
with un-indexed files forces FogScan to be quite slow.

If you find that your systems does not have enough memory to create the index 
files for a single data file, try booting with a minimum system (no CONFIG.SYS
and a small PATH= in your AUTOEXEC.BAT). You'll need about 540K of memory
available. (CHKDSK reports the number of bytes free -- creating the index
for the FOG-DOS.DTA distributed on the 3.5" disk version of FogScan was done
on a system with 54811 bytes free.)
