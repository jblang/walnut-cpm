                  FogScan uses one or more data files.  Each data file
                  has a name which begins with "Fog" and ends in ".DTA".
                  The DOS version uses optional index files; their names 
                  end in ".IDX" and ".IXP".  If the index files are 
                  missing, the DOS version of FogScan can reconstruct 
                  them, provided your system has enough memory.  Because 
                  of memory and disk size limitations, the CP/M version 
                  cannot use the index files at all.

             Changes from Previous Versions

             DOS Version:  The DOS version now features indexed search, the 
                           ability to reconstruct missing data file indexes, 
                           and much faster approximate spelling search when 
                           the index files are missing.  The new DOS version 
                           also allows you to print a single item, the whole 
                           file, the disk summaries only, or tagged items 
                           only.  Special thanks to Steve Brammer.  Hercules 
                           monochrome adaptors should now show highlighting.
    
             CP/M Version: The CP/M version now performs OR searches 
                           correctly (thank you Alan B).  The setup program 
                           now sets it up correctly to run on Osborne and 
                           similar machines;  the setup program can now also 
                           set up FogScan to run on Commodore 128 in color 
                           without patching or requiring a special version.

                           Version 2.38 of the full CP/M program handles 
                           formatting and display of publication index files 
                           as well as library data.  It is otherwise identical 
                           to version 2.34 and it uses the same setup program.  

             Harware and System Requirements

                  DOS Version:     IBM PC, XT, AT, PS/2 or close
                  (FOGSCAND.EXE)   compatible with at least 256K RAM, 
                                   any display card.  
                                   PC-DOS or MS-DOS 2.1x or above.

                  CP/M version:    Z80 compatible CP/M system.
                  (FOGSCANC.COM)   48K TPA minimum. CP/M 2.2 or 3.x

                  (FGSCNBBS.COM)   A special trimmed version which only
                                   requires a 43.25K TPA is available to
                                   CP/M BBS SysOps directly from Fog.


             General Description

                  The disk libraries of Fog contain thousands of files on 
                  several hundred disks.  Since the library is constantly 
                  being updated, searching through a printed catalog for 
                  the kind of file you are interested in can be like looking 
                  for a needle in a haystack.

                  FOGSCAND.EXE and FOGSCANC.COM are the PC-DOS and CP/M 
                  versions of FogScan, a program which allows you to 
                  browse and search the on-line Fog library guides.

                  FogScan also allows you to browse and search the Fog 
                  publication indexes for FOGLIGHT and FOGHORN.

        FOGSCAN.DOC                                               PAGE 3


             Getting Started

                  FogScan uses the FOG-xxxx.DTA data files compiled and 
                  regularly updated by Fog.  There are data files for the 
                  DOS and CP/M libraries, and for FOGLIGHT and FOGHORN.  
                  The same data files work with the DOS and the CP/M 
                  versions of the program. 

                  Depending on whether you are running DOS or CP/M, type
                  FOGSCAND or FOGSCANC at the system prompt.  If no data 
                  file is found in the current drive and path when you 
                  start the program, you will be prompted for a path in 
                  which to find them. 

                  When you start FogScan, you first see the Fog copyright 
                  notice.  If there is more than one Fog data file on the 
                  default drive, you get to choose from a list.  If there 
                  is only one, FogScan opens it directly.  If there is 
                  none, FogScan asks you to specify a drive or path.

                  In the DOS version only, if the optional index files 
                  are bad or rmissing, FogScan offers to rebuild them.  
                  This takes a while, and you don't have to do it now.
         
                  You can change files while FogScan is running.  
                  However, if the data files are on different disks, you 
                  should use the "Change File" command in the FogScan 
                  main menu when you change disks, otherwise FogScan may 
                  get very confused.  


             Using Search

                  With FogScan, you can search for specific items by name, 
                  for disks by number, or locate all the shareware 
                  programs.  When looking at a publication index, you can 
                  search by author, by title or by issue.  You can also 
                  look for multiple keywords.  Anything in the item name 
                  or description can act as a keyword.  For instance, if 
                  you look for "Edit", FogScan will show you every item 
                  where the string "Edit" appears.  Case does not matter, 
                  so it will find "QEDIT" as well as "editor".

                  If FogScan allows you to search for multiple keywords 
                  with "AND" or "OR" operators.  For instance, if you 
                  look for "This or That", FogScan will find every record 
                  that contains either "This" or "That".  If you look for 
                  "This and That", FogScan will find only the records 
                  that contain both "This" and "That".  You can use up to 
                  five keywords with either "or" or "and" between them; 
                  you cannot mix "or" and "and" in the same search, 
                  though.  If you do not specify an operator, "and" is 
                  assumed.

             Searching in the DOS version.

                  In the DOS version, you can even look for items if you 
                  are not sure how they are spelled.  For instance, you 
                  can look for "PCRite" and it will find "PC-Write".  
                  This kind of search is quite a bit slower than a normal 
                  search.  To search for misspelled items, just type a 
                  space then the word "please" (without the quotes) after 
                  the name of the item you are looking for.  
                  Unfortunately for CP/M users, there is not enough 
                  memory in CP/M systems to allow this kind of search.

                  Another feature of the DOS version is indexed search.  
                  If the correct index files were found with the data 
                  file, you see "(Indexed)" in the top window of the 
                  FogScan screen.  FogScan always searches the index 
                  first.  When searching the index, FogScan looks only at 
                  the beginning of the words.  Every word in the file is 
                  indexed, except words such as "the" or "when".  If it 
                  does not find anything in the index, FogScan asks you 
                  whether to look harder.  When FogScan looks harder, it 
                  ignores the index, and the search works exactly as 
                  described in the "Using Search" section above.


             On-line Help

                  Context-sensitive on-line help is available.  In the 
                  DOS version, it is available at any time by pressing 
                  F1.  In the CP/M version, it is available in every 
                  menu.  You cannot do any damage by running the program, 
                  so the easiest way to find out how it works is to 
                  simply fire it up, play with various commands, and ask 
                  for help if you get stumped.


             Printing

                  To print an item while you are looking at it, hold down 
                  the Ctrl key and press P.  FogScan will advance the 
                  paper automatically when the items you print that way 
                  reach the bottom of the page.  To print the whole file, 
                  hold down the Ctrl key and press A.  FogScan assumes 
                  that you have continuous feed paper or a laser printer.
                  Printing is not available if you are running FogScan 
                  through a bulletin board system.

             Tagging

                  This facility is available in the DOS version only, and 
                  only for the library data files.  When any library item 
                  is displayed, you can tag the disk number for that item 
                  by just pressing the T key.  A star will appear next to 
                  the disk name to indicate that it is tagged.  You can 
                  remove the tag by pressing U.  Many disks contain more 
                  than one item, but only entire disks get tagged, so you 
                  may see the tag indicator on items other than those you 
                  had tagged directly.  To view a list of the tagged 
                  items, press F8.  The tags do not disappear if you 
                  change to another file.  When you exit FogScan, you 
                  will be asked if you want to print an order form.  If 
                  you answer yes, a list of all the tagged disks will 
                  then be printed along with the form. 


             Color on DOS Machines.

                  The DOS version runs in color with color video 
                  adapters, and in monochrome with monochrome video 
                  adapters.  If you have a color video adapter but only a 
                  composite (one-color) monitor, or if you are using a 
                  laptop, the color effects will look pretty bad;  some 
                  screens may even be unreadable.  If you have this 
                  problem, use SETFGSCD.EXE to set up FogScan so it will 
                  always come up in monochrome.

                  If you don't want to modify your copy of FogScan but 
                  you want it to run in monochrome, be sure to put the 
                  statement "MODE BW80" in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file, or to 
                  type "MODE BW80" at the DOS prompt before running 
                  FOGSCAND.  MODE.COM is a DOS program which you should 
                  have on your system diskette.  Another way is to call 
                  FogScan with the parameter "BW".  FogScan will then run 
                  in monochrome mode.


             Poorly Compatible MS-DOS Machines

                  Some MS-DOS "compatibles" are not very compatible, and 
                  will not run FOGSCAND correctly.  There is very little 
                  we can do about that, because developing a "generic" 
                  MS-DOS version would be quite expensive.  In BBS mode, 
                  FOGSCAND should run on any DOS machine.  See "Using 
                  command lines parameters", below, for info on how to 
                  run FogScan in BBS mode or on not very compatible MS-
                  DOS systems.  If your machine can run CP/M programs, 
                  you can also try to run the CP/M version.

             Rebuilding DOS Version Index files (DOS version only)

                  When the index files that go with a data file are 
                  missing , or if the index files don't match the 
                  contents of the data file, FogScan offers to rebuild 
                  the index files at the time you choose the data file.  
                  Depending on the speed of your machine, this process 
                  can take up to 40 minutes for a large data file.  You 
                  also need considerable room on the disk which already 
                  contains the data file (typically 100 Kbytes or so).  
                  The DOS date stamp of the index files may be different 
                  from the DOS date stamp of the data file.  That's OK.

                  Important note:  You do *not* need the index files to 
                  run FogScan, but searches are much faster with the 
                  index files.  Also, if you have less than 384K of RAM, 
                  the index rebuilding may fail for lack of memory.

          
             Pretty CP/M version

                  The CP/M version of FogScan can run full-screen 
                  (without scrolling, and with highlighting when 
                  available) on any computer which can emulate an Osborne 
                  or ADM3-A terminal.  Just add the keyword 'CUTE' on the 
                  command line at the CP/M prompt.  You can also use 
                  SETFGSCC.COM to set up your copy of FogScan so it will 
                  always come up in this mode automatically.


             Color on Commodore 128

                  You can use the SETFGSCC.COM to set up your copy of 
                  FOGSCANC.COM to run in color on a Commodore 128 with a 
                  color monitor.  Just answer "Yes" when the appropriate

             Using Command Line Parameters:

                  Optional command line parameters can be used in any
                  order when you start FogScan. They are:

                  * Screen width (a number from 52 to 80). Default is 80.

                  * A path to locate the data files. Must contain at
                    least one drive descriptor with a colon. Default is
                    the current drive (and directory in DOS version).

                  * The string 'BBS' to run the browser in BBS mode. In
                    this mode, a CR is required after every command, ^K
                    is used to interrupt the search (search interrupt is
                    not available in the DOS BBS version), and the header
                    is not displayed. Printing is disabled and is not
                    mentioned in the on-line help in BBS mode.

                  * DOS users can also use the parameter 'BW' to force
                    FogScan to run in black and white on a color video 
                    adapter, or the parameter 'MSDOS' to run FogScan in 
                    'plain vanilla' MSDOS mode.

                  * CP/M users can use the parameter 'CUTE' to make 
                    FogScan run in full-screen mode on an Osborne or ADM-
                    3A compatible terminal. 

                  Examples of command line parameter usage:

                            A>fogscan 52 B:

                    Use 52-column screen width and look for library files
                    on drive B.

                            A>fogscan C:\Downloads\Fogstuff\

                    Look for the data file(s) in specified drive and
                    subdirectory. \ at the end of the path is optional.

                    The CP/M version does not understand subdirectories.

                           A>fogscan bw

                    Run the program in black and white (applicable only
                    on DOS machines with a color video adapter).

                            A>fogscan BBS F12:

                    Run the program in BBS mode (i.e. with input/output
                    redirection enabled) and look for data file(s) on
                    drive F, user area 12 (user areas are a CP/M feature
                    only).

                            A>fogscan cute 52 

                    Run the "plain vanila", unpatched CP/M version of 
                    FogScan on an Osborne 1 with 52-column screen, taking 
                    advantage of screen highlighting.


             Miscellaneous Information

                  FogScan was written in Turbo Pascal by Claude Ostyn.  
                  The CP/M version is compiled with Turbo Pascal 3.0, and 
                  the DOS version is compiled with Turbo Pascal 5.0.  
                  FogScan is a copyrighted program which you can 
                  distribute and share with others as long as you do not 
                  modify it, you do not charge any fee beyond a 
                  reasonable duplication and media cost of up to $10, and 
                  you distribute ALL the files together, including this 
                  documentation file and the data files.  


             Running on a BBS

                  Both the CP/M and the DOS versions of the program can
                  run on a bulletin board if the board software allows it 
                  to execute a .COM or .EXE program and to redirect 
                  normal console input and output to the remote terminal.  
                  The new DOS version fixes several problems with BBS 
                  use that caused previous versions to crash.


                  The behavior of FogScan is a little different when it 
                  runs in bulletin board mode.  For instance, you have to 
                  confirm menu choices by pressing <Return>.

                  If you have a CP/M BBS system and FOGSCANC.COM is too 
                  large to run on it, contact the Fog office for a copy 
                  of FGSCNBBS.COM.  FGSCNBBS.COM only requires 43.25K of 
                  TPA and does not have pretty video or printing.  It is 
                  otherwise full-featured, with support for library data 
                  files as well as publication index files and all the 
                  normal search and browsing facilities of the full CP/M 
                  version.  SETFGSCC.COM will also correctly set up the 
                  default drive/user path and default screen witdth for 
                  FGSCNBBS.COM.  Just be sure that FOGSCANC.COM is not on 
                  the default drive when you run SETFGSCC.

             Setting up the DOS version

                  Unlike earlier versions of FOGSCAN, this version now 
                  comes with a setup program which makes patching a 
                  breeze.

                  You can set up the default path for the data files, 
                  whether or not to run in BBS mode, the screen width for 
                  BBS mode, whether or not to use color, and whether or 
                  not to allow printing. 

                  To set up your copy of FOGSCAND.EXE, you need:
                  - Your copy of FOGSCAND.EXE, which MUST be named 
                    FOGSCAND.EXE or FOGSCAN.EXE.  No other name will 
                    work.
                  - SETFGSCD.EXE 
                  - A disk with at least 80Kbytes free.
                 
                  Make sure that FOGSCAND.EXE is in the default path and 
                  call up SETFGSCD.EXE.  The setup program will read 
                  FOGSCAND.EXE, show you what the setup options are, and 
                  prompt you for changes.  Note that the options may be 
                  different depending on whether you choose to run in BBS 
                  mode or not.  You will be able to review the changes 
                  before saving the modified copy.  You will also be able 
                  to cancel without making any changes.


             Setting up the CP/M version

                  FogScan now comes with a setup program which makes 
                  patching a breeze.  You can set up the default path for 
                  the data files, whether or not to run in BBS mode, 
                  whether or not to use full-screen video effects, 
                  whether or not to set up for a Commodore 128, the 
                  screen width, and whether or not to allow printing. 

                  To set up your copy of FOGSCAND.EXE, you need:

                  - Your copy of FOGSCANC.COM, which MUST be named 
                    FOGSCANC.COM, FOGSCAN.COM or FGSCNBBS.COM.  No 
                    other name will work.  This copy must be on a disk
                    with at least 34 Kbytes free.
                  - SETFGSCC.COM 
                 
                  Make sure that FOGSCANC.COM is in the default drive and 
                  call up SETFGSCC.EXE.  The setup program will read 
                  FOGSCANC.COM, show you what the setup options are, and 
                  prompt you for changes.  Note that the options may be 
                  different depending on whether you choose to run in BBS 
                  mode or not.  You will be able to review the changes 
                  before saving the modified copy.  You will also be able 
                  to cancel without making any changes.
