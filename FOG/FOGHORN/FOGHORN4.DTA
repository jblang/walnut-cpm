@Tried to patch dBASE to use WordStar as editor called by
dBASE II's MODIFY COMMAND, CTRL-U to mark a record for
deletion does not work in APPEND and EDIT modes. If you
rename the WordStar file WS.COM, it cannot return to WS.COM
after using the R command to run another program

@Easiest printing from WordStar, including dot commands
Use .SV rather than .AV when it is necessary to edit
variables in MailMerge files. Nuevo allows patching AUTOST
with NEWSETUP. Olivetti Ink Jet is totally unsupported
