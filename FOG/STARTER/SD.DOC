			Super Directory program
			-----------------------

INTRODUCTION:
------------

This is a help guide to operate the CP/M-80 Super Directory program.  It
is often renamed to "DIR.COM" on RCP/M systems or on systems running CCP
replacements that allow an external directory program.	It is one of the
most useful and one of the most versatile programs available for CP/M-80
computers.  It can direct its output the the CRT, to a printer or to a
disk file for later reference.	It can alphabetize a directory either
vertically or horizontally (selected when assembling the program but
can be changed to the other mode at any time for the current display.)
It shows how many files have been used on the current drive/user area,
how much space this has taken and how much space remains.  Those and
other useful features are mentioned below.  Spend at least a few moments
looking at the quick-reference option list as you may find some things
are now available that would be very beneficial when using your computer.

	To get a HELP Summary of Options:

			B0>SD ?

	Example of Option Usage:

			B0>SD $ANDLV (...etc.)

(The "$"  denotes start of commands but "/" or "[" may also be used.)


QUICK SUMMARY OF OPTIONS:
-------------------------

     A -  all user areas allowed, (0-15), some systems (0-31)
     C -  shows file sizes in records, rather than 'k'
     D -  all  drives starting with first available (usually A:)
     F -  file "DISK.DIR" created/appended with contents of output
     H -  shows all user areas from here to highest
     L -  LBR/ARC/ARK list option (shows names of member files)
     N -  defeats the page pause, permits non-stop display
     O -  shows only $SYS files in directory
     P -  copies output to printer
     Q -  shows files that have NOT yet been archived
     R -  resets  disk, if not already logged in
     S -  include any $SYS files
     T -  sorts files by type (extent)
     V -  shows version number and date
     X -  uses alternate listing format (horizontal/vertical)


COMMENTS:
---------
Using the $D option automatically starts on the first available drive
(usually A:) drive regardless of what drive you were on when you started.
It then checks all available drives.  Similarly, using the $A option
will always start with User 0 and individually display each available
user area.  If desired you can include a specified drive/user area on
the command line.  Any of the following can be used:


EXAMPLES OF USE:
---------------

		1)  B0>SD
		2)  B0>SD *.*
		3)  B0>SD *.COM
		4)  B0>SD C4:
		5)  B0>SD C4: *.COM
		6)  B0>SD $AND
		7)  B0>SD *.COM $AND
		8)  B0>SD *.COM /AND
		9)  B0>SD *.COM[AND

    1)	Normal use to show all files on the current drive/user area
    2)	Same as 1), shows all files on the current drive/user area
    3)	All files with .COM extent on current drive/user area
    4)	All files on C4: drive/user area, seldom used but possible
    5)	All .COM files on C4:  (normally you would go to C4: first)
    6)	Shows all files on all drives and all user areas, no pauses
	   (very useful for making a remote listing of all files)
    7)	All .COM files on all drives and all user areas, no pauses
    8)	Can use '/' UNIX-type command rather than '$' if you prefer
    9)	Can use CP/M+ type command, note no space is permitted here


OPTIONAL COMMANDS:
----------------

"A" -	All users:  Causes SD to display the directories of all the user
	areas starting at user 0 and continuing to the maximum
	available.  Most systems have 16 user areas, 0-15 but CP/M+ etc.
	can have 32 user areas 0-31.

"C" -	Shows file sizes in records:  Gives individual cile sizes in
	records instead of "k".  Sizes are followed by "r" instead of
	the normal "k" to indicate this option in effect.  Totals and
	library summary lines are still reported in "k".  Very nice on
	larger disk systems where 16k might be anything from 97-128
	records.

"D" -	All disk option:  Allows SD to search all disk drives on-line.
	It starts with the disk drive specified or implied with the
	command line filename.	Example:

		B0>SD $D	Shows all drives starting with A:
		B0>SD C:$D	SHows all drives starting with C:

"F" -	File option:  The directory output will be sent to a disk file
	named "DISK.DIR" on the default drive.	If this name already is
	present on that drive, then the directory output will be
	appended to the end of the file.  "DISK.DIR" will otherwise
	start as a new file.  The append feature allows you to build up
	one massive file on the default drive that contains the
	directories of all of your disks, without having to concatenate
	a swarm of individual files.

"H" -	From here option:  Displays files on all user areas from current
	to highest allowed (usually area 15 unless on a RCPM system.)
	It it handy to use on systems that have MANY files on user 0
	area, to see what remains on the other user areas.  If on B5:
	for example, using $H would show all the files (if any) from B5:
	through B15: if permitted to go that high.  (The $A option is
	ignored, if included, otherwise the $H option would not be
	requested.)

"L" -	LBR list option:  Allows for listing of ".LBR", ".ARC", or ".ARK"
	file members which are shown followed by their length in 'k' (or
	'r', if the 'C' option is used).  The total length of the entire
	library is is also shown.  These are always alphabetized hori-
	zontally and may have a little border (assembler option) at the
	left, showing it is a library listing.

"N" -	No page option:  Shows the display without stopping each when
	the screen is full.  Particularly useful for remote users on an
	RCPM so they can display the entire director non-stop for disk
	copy, etc. by using $AND, etc.

"O" -	Shows only $SYS files:	Very useful on large system where it is
	harder to notice an occasional $SYS file.

"P" -	Copy output to printer:  Highlighting characters are not sent
	(for files that are archived or set as $SYS files) and the "N"
	option is automatically selected to prevent [more] pauses.  To
	insure the file names are similar in appearance, only upper-case
	characters are sent to the printer.

"Q" -	Shows unarchived files:  Show the files that do NOT have the
	archive flag in a file's directory entry, set.	This will show
	new files that have been recently added to the disk.  For
	example, to see a list of ALL new files in ALL user areas of ALL
	drives:

		B0>SD $ADQ <ret>

	To see the new files in just the area that you are currently
	logged into, enter:

			B0>SD $Q <ret>

	(Note: This is worthless on systems that do not use any archive
	backup system.)

"R" -	Reset disk system:  A disk system reset is done before directory
	information is accumulated.  Useful to show the correct free
	space remaining when a new diskette has been inserted, etc.
	(Without a reset, it will show the remaining space for whatever
	disk was last logged in.)  Not useful and a waste of time on a
	hard drive.

"S" -	Include $SYS files:  Files with  the $SYS attribute set are
	normally not displayed.  This option includes them.  Also see
	the "O" which displays ONLY the $SYS files.

"T" -	Order files by type:  Alphabetizes files by type (extension).
	This groups files of the same type together.  Such as .ASM, COM,
	LBR.)

"V" -	SD Version number, suffix, and date is displayed.

"X" -	Use alternate listing format - If vertical alphabetization is in
	effect normally, using this option will cause a horizontal
	listing to be shown.  If horizontal is the default, then this
	option produces a vertical listing.
