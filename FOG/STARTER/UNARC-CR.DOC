Quick documentation for UNARC and UNCR

Both UNARC and UNCR have built in help screens... just type UNARC<cr> or
UNCR<cr> to get help on command syntax.

UNARC will extract standard .ARC or .ARK files.  The simplest method is to
extract all the files at once.  For example, if you have a file called
PROGRAM.ARK on drive A: and you want to extract all the files to drive B:, just
put a copy of UNARC.COM on drive A: with your .ARK file and type:
         UNARC PROGRAM B:<cr>

UNARCA is an 8080 version of UNARC that works in the same fashion.

UNCR will uncompress most .?Z? files (where the ? can be any character). If you
want to uncrunch a file called PROGRAM.DZC to the same drive it is already on,
you would type the command:
        UNCR PROGRAM<cr>
UNCR will also unsqueeze most .?Q? files (where the ? can be any character).
The command syntax is the same.

NOTE:  UNARC will both extract multiple files from a single .ARC or .ARK file
and uncompress them, while UNCR will usually be used on files that have been
first extracted from a .LBR file (with DE-LBR on this disk).

The complete documentation and in most cases the Z80 source code is available in
the FOG Library for these programs.
