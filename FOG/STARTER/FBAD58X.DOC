     This is version of Findbad that will operate correctly on
the Osborne Executive.  This was not done by rewriting findbad
for CP/M Plus, but by installing a RSX in the CP/M 2.2 version of
Findbad.  This simple procedure will work on many CP/M programs
that previously would not work on CP/M Plus.
     When using this version of findbad, the first difference you
will notice is that the message BIOS ver 2.21 ACTIVE will be
displayed.  This is the RSX that will keep the program from
bombing.
     The next difference you will see is that if a bad sector is
found, a CP/M plus error message will be display saying:
  BIOS error reading drive B: crc-error
  Retry this operation (Y or N)?
      Just answer N for No, and findbad will lockout the sector
by creating a file [UNUSED].BAD
      Wish I could take credit for this, but the credit goes to
the author of BIOS2-21.  BIOS2-21 is based on a program that
first appeared in Dr. Dobbs, and was corrected by Monroe Chasson
of the New York Osborne Users Group.  This is just one application
of his program, and you should get BIOS2-21.LBR if you want to
use the program further.  Thanks Monroe.
