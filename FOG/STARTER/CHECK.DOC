CHEK is the program FOG uses to calculate a CRC value for all the files in the
library.  If you are in doubt of the integrity of a program, use the CHEK.COM
program to create a CRC value and compare it with the one listed in the DISK.DOC
file.  For example, we want to get the correct CRC for the file PROGRAM.DOC.
The correct syntax is:
        CHEK PROGRAM.DOC<cr>
Standard CP/M wildcard characters are accepted.

You can also create a disk file by appending the F option after the command.
For example:
        CHEK *.* F<cr>
will create a file on the default disk called CHEKLIST.CRC that contains a list
of all the files and their CRC values.
