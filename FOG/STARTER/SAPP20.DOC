	    Sort & Pack Directory for CP/M 2.2 and 3.0
		       By George F. Reding

		       Based upon SAP v 44
		      With subroutines from
			CPM22E and SYSLIB

------------------------------------------------------------------------
			      NOTES

A bug was found in v 1.9 when used under CP/M 2.2 where the DMA pointer
was not being advanced, so the buffer under 2.2 was being overwritten,
thus trashing the directory.  The bug has been corrected by having moved
1 label and added another label, eg, DIRLOP & DIRLP1.  Thanks to David
Bowerman, the Sysop of Frog Hollow RCPM System (604-937-0906) for having
located the cause of the problem.  David then tested it on a disk with
250 of 256 directory entries used, under CP/M 2.2 and all is now fine.

SAPP v1.8 clobbered the DE registers in the XBIOS2 routine for 2.2 which
caused the SECTRAN function to not work under CP/M 2.2.

My previous versions of this program for CP/M 3.0 only are also docu-
mented in the source code of the program.  This new version has improve-
ments which I shall attempt to briefly describe.

The program uses Z80 code wherever I could possibly make use of it,
therefore, it can only be used on those systems which have a Z80 CPU.
A simple test of Bob Freed's is used at the beginning of the program.

Then the CP/M version number is obtained from the system and is stored
in the program.  This program uses BIOS functions for disk input/output
and for such operations the version number is checked and appropriate
routines are subsequently selected.

Data areas are initially zero-filled, with an additional buffer area
being set up if CP/M 3.0.  If CP/M 3.0, the DPB offset and DPB lengths
are set accordingly.

The desired disk is selected and the translation table address and DPB
is copied to the program.  The program then tests the DRM value of the
DPH, tests to see if there is enough TPA room to copy all of the direc-
tory entries into the TPA.  If not enough room then a calculation is
made to determine the maximum number of entries that the TPA can hold,
which is then stored in the program's copy of the DPB for its usage and
a warning is then given to the user.  (The warning may optionally be
turned-off if the user providing that the user can remember to never ex-
ceed the maximum number of entries that the program can handle.  If the
warning flag is set for no message, then the program will continue on
its own.)

This auto-faking of the DRM may occur when either the TPA is too low or
the DRM is too large or both.  It will work for CP/M 2.2 or 3.0 systems.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
			  CONFIGURATION

Very few items are required to be set by the user in either source code
or in the COM file in order to use this program.  In the .COM file these
user configurable bytes "should" be at the following locations (they
follow the signon message that ends with my initials GFR and a 01A hex
in case the .COM file was typed):

	011B	Clear screen code (6 bytes maximum)
	0121	Null terminator for above
	0122	CP/M 3.0 largest sector size (low/high)
	0124	Normally E5 hex
	0125	Normally 00 hex

The byte at 011B is the clear screen code for your console.  If you do
NOT desire to clear your screen on program start, then set this first
byte to 00 hex.  Six bytes maximum may be used for your clear screen
code.  The byte at 0121 is a zero terminator for the clear screen.  If
using less than 6 bytes to clear your screen, then set any unused bytes
to zero.

At 0122 hex, is a word value for CP/M 3.0 systems.  Set this to your
largest sector size used on your system.  The first byte of that word
value is the low and the second byte is the high of the word, eg, for
1024 byte sectors the byte at 0122 is 00 hex and at 0123 is 04 hex.
CP/M 2.2 users should just ignore this.

The byte at 0124 hex should be E5 hex.	The Morrow hard disk users (with
the MD5, MD11, etc) should set it to 00 hex.  It is the value for the RC
field of the directory entries.  On a Morrow hard disk computer, Morrow
would set the  RC field of each potential directory entry to 00 with the
other bytes to the normal E5, when the hard drive is formatted.  Whether
it is checked by any of the Morrow utilities/programs or not is yet to
be determined by me, so in order to prevent possible conflict with any
possible Morrow program or utility, I have retained the oddity.  Leave
the byte at 0124 set to E5 hex if you are NOT using a Morrow hard disk
computer.

The byte at 0125 hex is the warning message flag.  It should be 00 hex
to enable the program to give its warning message when the TPA is low
and/or the DRM is too large.  Keep this byte set to zero unless your
human memory is good and/or you are an experienced computer user.  If
it's set to a NON-zero the program will not give a message, and will
continue as if everything was alright.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
			      USAGE

It's not required to have this program on the drive on which its work is
to be performed.   Some examples are as follows, where this program is
on drive A.

	A>SAPP		do drive A
	A>SAPP B:	do drive B
	A>SAPP C:	do drive C
	B>SAPP		do drive B (system uses search-path)
	B>A:SAPP B:	do drive B (no system search-path)
	B>SAPP C:	do drive C (system uses search-path)
	B>A:SAPP C:	do drive C (no system search-path)

------------------------------------------------------------------------
		     WARNING MESSAGE OPTION

If you encounter a warning message it is either because your TPA is too
low and/or your system has the capability to have to have too many di-
rectory entries  (than what the available memory can hold).  If you are
unsure of the number of entries that are occupied then you should not
continue at this time.

You then have to eliminate some files from disk with PIP and by erasing
them and/or by using "DU" to "manually" perform a bit of what this pro-
gram does.  Once you are sure that your number of directory entries does
not exceed the maximum shown in the program's warning message, you may
continue.  Be forewarned that to continue with the program when MORE en-
tries exist than what the program states it can handle could very well
destroy your directory!  (If in doubt, don't!)

------------------------------------------------------------------------
			     RELEASE

I have tested the program on a Morrow MD11 (now with two 20 Mb hard disk
drives) under CP/M 3.0. It has also been tested on a CP/M 2.2 system.

This is a free "public domain" program, and as with most all programs,
no warranties or guarantees are expressed or implied, although much ef-
fort is made to ensure bug-free operation of the program.  Any user of
the program uses  it at their own risk.
