NSWP 2	-   A disk maintenance utility


Introduction

     NSWP is a new disk utility than can replace many of the more

common utilities  that are used, such as DISK7, PIP, PRINT, PROT,
SQ, STAT, SWEEP, TYPE, USQ and others.	In only 12K of disk space
it replaces over 100K of utilities!

     NSWP is written entirely in assembly language,  and will run
on any CP/M 2.x, 3.x or MP/M based system with no changes.  Since
it is coded in 8080 assembler,	any 8080,  8085 or Z80 compatible
processor will work.  Note that this program WILL NOT run on CP/M
1.4.

     When  NSWP  was  conceived,  the dominant file  utility  was
SWEEP,	and thus NSWP is syntax compatible with SWEEP,	but  with
many  extensions.  This  allows  you to directly rename  NSWP  to
SWEEP, if you so desire, with no retraining period.

     I hope that you enjoy  this program,  and use it  well.  Any
problems, or suggestions may be directed to myself at the address
on the first page, or on one of the following RCP/Ms:

Edmonton RCP/M - (403) 454-6093 (300 or 1200 baud)
Stadium RCP/M  - (403) 479-3450 (300 baud only)

NSWP 2	-   A disk maintenance utility


			  NSWP Overview

     NSWP is a directory and file manipulation program.  With it,
you can copy,  delete,	rename, unsqueeze and squeeze files.  The
documentation  following  is  split into two  major  sections:	A
tutorial  for the inexperienced,  and a  reference  section.  The
reference  normally will be used in conjunction with the  program
to  answer specific questions regarding NSWP.  The tutorial is	a
broad  coverage  of  all of the functions,  and  should  be  read
through at least once.

     The most important thing to remember when using NSWP is that
it  provides a list of your files in ALPHABETICAL  order.  Moving
around	in this list is quite easy,  and will soon become  second
nature.

     In this  documentation,  all user	input is  underlined.  As
well,	when   the"current"	file  is   referenced	in   this
documentation,	it means the file just to the left of your input.
This"current"  file  is often  referred to as the  file  you  are
"on".

NSWP 2	-   A disk maintenance utility


			  Invoking NSWP

     To  make effective use of NSWP,  you must know  the  various
options  available to you when you invoke NSWP.  Here are some of
the options:

A>NSWP
     This  format simply loads NSWP,  and scans the default drive
and  user for filenames.  Once inside NSWP,  you may change to	a
different  drive  and/or  user,  but when you exit  you  will  be
returned to the drive/user that you called NSWP from.

A>NSWP *.COM
     This format loads NSWP and scans the current drive and  user
for  all filenames with the extension '.COM'.  Note that NSWP can
find  system files as well,  so no additional information need be
given.

A>NSWP B:*.COM *
     The  presence of the second asterisk indicates to NSWP  that
you wish to scan all user areas of the indicated disk  drive.  In
this case, all '.COM files on all user areas on drive B.

     Combinations  of the above are acceptable,  and you may even
log to all user areas,	and find all files with the specification
'*.* *'.

     Once  inside  NSWP you are presented with	a  menu,  then	a
report of which drive and user you are logged to,  how much space
is  taken  by the files you have specified,  how many files  have
been found with the specifications given,  and how much space  is
left on the disk. A sample follows:

Drive A0:  596K in 36 files.  735K free.

     A	special format of this line shows that you are logged  to
all user areas:

Drive B*:  950K in 234 files.  2956K free.

     From this point, you may execute any of the menu options.

     A	special  display  occurs if no files are found	with  the
specification  you have given,	or if there are no files  in  the
given drive/user area(s):

No files.

     This  display may also occur if you delete all the files out
of a given specification. When this occurs, your menu choices are
limited to ONLY 'S', 'L' or 'X'.  This allows you to see the free
Space on a drive, to Log to another drive/user,  or to eXit.   No
other choices are valid, nor will they be accepted.

NSWP 2	-   A disk maintenance utility


Command Structure

     There are two primary types of commands in NSWP:  those that
act  on  one file and  those that act on many  files.  We will go
through  them both.  Before doing that though,	let's try  moving
around in NSWP first.

     To move in NSWP, you must first understand that the files on
your selected  drive/user will be presented  to you in	a  sorted
manner.  The  files  are sorted in  this  order:  Filename,  File
extension, user area:

   1. B0: -WORK   .001	  0K :	
   2. B0: ARCADD  .COM	  4K :	
   3. B0: ARCCOPY .COM	  2K :	

     As you can see, the files are numbered for your convenience.
You may not directly use these numbers.  As you can see, the file
size is also shown (rounded to the nearest block size).

     Note  that  if you have enabled the reverse  video  sequence
(see  Epilog),	you  may see some of the letters in the  filename
printed  in reverse video.  The chart below shows how  to  decode
this information.

	  FFFFFFFF RSA
	  12345678 /YR
	  |||||||| OSC

   4. B0: ARCDEL  .COM	  2K :	

     As you can see, this looks confusing.  Really, though, it is
not.  The  tags F1-F8 normally are not used,  but NSWP allows you
set F1-F4 for your own use.  The R/O tag means that the file  may
be read, but not written to. The SYS tag means that the file does
not appear in normal DIR listings, and in CP/M 3, MPM and CP/M 86
also means that this file is avaiable to all user areas.  The ARC
tag means that,  if set, the file has been backed up since it was
last accessed.

     Now that you understand how files are presented,  we can  go
through a sample session.  Remember, user input is underlined.

NSWEEP	 -  Version 2.05     04/11/1984
	(c) Dave Rand, 1983, 1984
	    Edmonton, Alberta

A - Retag files        :  Q - Squeeze/Unsqeeze tagged files
B - Back one file      :  R - Rename file(s)
C - Copy file	       :  S - Check remaining space
D - Delete file        :  T - Tag file for transfer
E - Erase T/U files    :  U - Untag file
F - Find file	       :  V - View file
L - Log new disk/user  :  W - Wildcard tag of files
M - Mass file copy     :  Y - Set file status.
P - Print file	       :  ? - Display this help
X - Exit to CP/M       :  cr, sp - Forward one file



Moving forward and backward

     As you can see,  the two most common commands will be moving
forward and backwards through the directory. Either the SPACE bar
(<SP>), or the RETURN key (<CR>) may be used to move forward.  To
move backwards simply use the 'B' key.	Note that all commands in
NSWP can be either in upper or lowercase.  Internally,	lowercase
will  be  converted  to uppercase.  If you reach the end  of  the
directory  with either	command,  you will be "wrapped around" to
the other end automatically.

NSWP 2	-   A disk maintenance utility


Exiting

     To exit, just use the 'X' command as shown above.	This will
return you to the same drive and user area that you invoked  NSWP
from, regardless of anything you may have done in NSWP.

Finding a file

     Since you may have many hundreds of files selected,  you may
wish  to  move	rapidly to a particular file.  You  may  do  this
through the 'F', or FIND command.

   1. B0: -WORK   .001	  0K : F  Which file? BASCOM

   8. B0: BASCOM  .COM	 32K :

     The  Find	command always starts looking from  entry  number
one. You may use the standard CP/M syntax for wildcarding (eg: to
find the first .HEX file,  you may use *.HEX), and also note that
the  Find command will fill all blank spaces with question marks.
This  makes the search strings 'B*.*',	'B',  and 'B??????.'  all
find the first file beginning with 'B'.  As you  experiment,  you
will find other interesting uses for this command.


     At  this  point,  you  now  know how to  move  through  your
directory,  both rapidly and one step at a time. Let's move on to
some more useful commands.

Viewing and Printing a file

     The View command,	invoked with a 'V', will type the current
file onto the screen unsqueezing the file if required.	Note that
this command will NOT prevent you from listing ANY type of  file,
so  you  must  use your own judgement on what can and  cannot  be
listed.  At the end of each page on the screen,  view will  stop,
and allow you to abort the viewing with a ^C or a ^X.  To get one
more line from the file, hit the space bar.  To get another page,
hit the <CR> or RETURN key.

     The Print command, invoked with a 'P', will send the current
file,  with  no  modifications	or paging,  to the  current  LST:
device.  You  may  abort the print with a ^C  or  ^X.  All  other
features of the View command apply.


Deleting a file

     You can delete the current file just by hitting the 'D' key.
Before deletion occurs, you will be prompted.

  12. B0: CDP1	  .	 40K : D  Delete file? Y
  12. B0: DEAD	  .DAT	100K :




			     - 8 -





NSWP 2	-   A disk maintenance utility


     If any reply other than 'y' or 'Y' is given, the file is not
deleted.  If the file is deleted, it is removed from the list and
the next file is given the current file's number.

     If the file is a Read Only file, you will be prompted again:

  12. B0: CDP1	  .	 40K : D  Delete file? Y  R/O. Delete? Y
  12. B0: DEAD	  .DAT	100K :


Copying a file

     While on any file, you may copy that file to:
A) Another name, on the same drive/user
B) Another name, on a different drive/user
C) The same name, on a different drive/user

     NSWP  will  prevent  you from copying a  file  to	the  same
drive/user  that  the source file resides on.  Other  than  that,
there are no restrictions on where you wish the file to be.  If a
file  exists  on the same drive/user that you wish to  place  the
destination  file,  the  existing file is deleted  automatically,
even  if  it  is Read Only.  When NSWP copies  a  file,  all  the
attributes of the original file are passed on to the  destination
file.  Thus,  if a file is a SYS,  R/O file,  NSWP will cause the
destination  file  to be SYS,  R/O after the file copy has  taken
place.

  12. B0: CDP1	  .	 40K : C  Copy to (filespec)? C9:BACK.CDP

     If you wish to preserve the name of the file,  you may  just
enter the destination drive/user part of the filespec (eg. C9: in
the  preceding example would have copied the file to drive C user
9, retaining the name CDP1).  Just entering the drive part of the
filespec causes  NSWP  to retain the user number  of  the  source
file.

     If the filename is followed by a space, then a 'V', the file
will be verify read after it is written.  NSWP maintains a CRC of
the file as it is writing the file, and verifies this CRC.


Renaming files

     The Rename command ('R') may be used to:
A) Change the name of one file
B) Change the names of many files
C) Change the user number of one file
D) Change the user number of many files

     To just change the name of one file, the syntax is simple:

  12. B0: CDP1	  .	 40K : R  New name, or *? CDP2
  12. B0: CDP2	  .	 40K :



			     - 9 -





NSWP 2	-   A disk maintenance utility


     You may also change the user number of the file, as follows:

  12. B0: CDP1	  .	 40K : R  New name, or *? B1:CDP2
  12. B1: CDP1	  .	 40K :

     Note  that if all user areas are not specified in the  logon
of NSWP,  the file may not be shown on your list when renaming to
another user area.

     To change a group of files from one name to another, you may
enter the following command at any file:

   9. B0: BASIC   .COM	 24K : R  New name, or *? *

Old name? *.HEX
New name? *.BAK

     At  this  point  all files with the extension .HEX  will  be
renamed  to the same filename but with the  extension  .BAK.  You
will see a running display on the screen as each file is renamed.
Any  valid wildcard may be used to select the source  files,  and
the destination files will take one character from the source for
each  '?'  in  the name.  An asterisk qualifies  as  filling  the
remainder of the field with '?'.  If the destination file exists,
the rename is not made.
































			     - 10 -





NSWP 2	-   A disk maintenance utility


     You  may  also choose to rename a group of files to  another
user area, optionally changing their names as well:

   9. B0: BASIC   .COM	 24K : R  New name, or *? *

Old name? *.HEX
New name? B1:*.BAK



     This command will rename all .HEX files on drive B user 0 to
the  same filename,  but with the extension .BAK,  and place  the
resultant file in user 1.  You may want to try this command a few
times to get the hang of it, but it is extremely powerful.


The Space command

     The  Space command ('S') simply asks you for a  drive  code,
then  tells  you  the remaining space on the drive  you  specify.
Before doing the space check, a drive reset is performed, so feel
free to change disks.


The Log Command

     The Log command ('L') allows you to change your directory to
another drive or user.	Additionally, it allows you to re-specify
the wildcard mask just like entering the NSWP program from  CP/M.
As well,  the drive system is reset,  so again you should be able
to  change  to a different diskette at this point or  to  another
part  of  the same diskette.  When the Log command is  used,  the
instructions are reprinted for review.

NSWP 2	-   A disk maintenance utility


	       Introduction to Multifile commands

     Now that all the commands that affect single files have been
described, it is time to introduce the concept	of Multifile com-
mands.	These commands	are ones  that affect as few as one or as
many as all of the files on a single disk. To affect these files,
though,  we  must have some way of describing which files need to
be affected.  CP/M has a way to do this,  using "wildcards". This
program, on the other hand, uses the concept of a file"tag".

The Tag command

     Tagging a file,  in its simplest form,  can be  accomplished
just  by  depressing  the  'T' key when the  file  to  be  tagged
appears.  What	exactly is a tag?  A tagged file is a file in the
list  of filenames that has an asterisk next to the  colon  after
the name of the file, as shown below.

   9. B0: BASIC   .COM	 24K :*

     A tagged file is different from an untagged file in that you
may  now  request an operation that deals with several	unrelated
files (eg., Files that	will not match	using only one wildcard).
A sample"tag" session is shown:

   9. B0: BASIC   .COM	 24K : T  Tagged files =   24K (  23K).
  10. B0: BRUN	  .COM	 16K : T  Tagged files =   40K (  39K).

     Note that	the 'T' command  automatically	performs  a "move
forward" operation.

     To  the right of the 'Tagged files' message two  numbers are
displayed.  The numbers are the total size in K, of the files you
have  tagged so far.  This is useful if,  for  example,  you  are
moving files from one size of diskette to another,  smaller, size
diskette.  If  the  source disk holds 500K,  and the  destination
holds 256K,  you can stop the tagging operation when your size is
just less than 256K.  The tag function in itself does not perform
any  operation,  other than to mark the file for a future"mass"
operation.

     By now the astute reader will notice  that I  have  cleverly
skipped over the function of the second  number  display, the one
in parenthesis.  This number is the combined  size of the  tagged
files, IN 1K BLOCKS.  If you are  using  a computer  system  that
supports  many different  disk	sizes/formats, or a system with a
hard disk  attached, you may  already know that CP/M can allocate
storage only in "BLOCKS", and  that  these "BLOCKS" may  be up to
16k in length.	This means that NSWP would show a file containing
say, 512 bytes in information, as being up to 16k long, depending
on your computer.  The second number in the tag display shows how
much storage the cumulative files would take if they were  stored
on a single-sided, single-density, 8" diskette.




			     - 12 -





NSWP 2	-   A disk maintenance utility


Wildcard tagging

     Another way to tag files is the wildcard tag function.  This
function accepts a CP/M type wildcard and proceeds to tag all the
files that match the wildcard.	To invoke this,  just hit 'W' and
you will be prompted with the message 'Which files?  '	Enter any
CP/M wildcard, right down to a unique filename,  and if that file
exists it will be tagged and displayed.

Untagging files

     If  you can tag a file,  you must be able to Untag a file as
well.

   9. B0: BASIC   .COM	 24K :*U  Tagged files =   16K (  16K).
  10. B0: BRUN	  .COM	 16K :*

     As  you can see,  the untag function subtracts  the  current
file's size from the total then displays the total of the remain-
ing files.


The mass copy command

     Now  that we have a number of files "tagged",  what do we do
with them?  Well the Mass copy function is one of those that acts
on many  files.  Its purpose  is to copy  the tagged file(s) from
one drive/user area to another drive/user area.

  12. B0: CDP1	  .	 40K : M
  Copy to drive/user? A14: V

Copying   --> B0: BRUN	  .COM	to A14:  with verify
Verifying --> file ok.

     The 'V' is optional,  and it indicates that you wish to have
the file verified after it is written.

     As  you can see,  the files have been sent to drive A,  user
14.  If you wish the tagged files to reside in the same user area
as the source files after the copy, do not specify a user area in
the  Mass command.  This will cause NSWP to put the file  in  the
same user area as the source file.

     NSWP will not allow you to copy a file to the same drive and
user area as the source. The copy is simply not made.

After the mass

     After any mass file operation,  the tags are "reset" as each
file is copied.  Visually,  they change from a '*' to a '#'.  The
files  are  logically untagged,  and will respond as  such.  But,
since  NSWP  remembers them,  you can automatically  retag  these
files.	This is useful if, for example, you need to copy the same
files  to  a  number of different diskettes or user  areas  on	a
drive. To invoke this, use the 'A' command.

  12. B0: CDP1	  .	 40K : A

Retagging--> B0: BRUN	 .COM	Tagged files =	  16K (  16K)



Erasing files

     You may want to copy a group of files, then delete them from
the source disk after the copy has been made. To do this, you can
use either the 'C' command to copy,  followed by the 'D' command,
which is tedious,  or a combination of the 'T', 'M', 'A', and the
'E' commands.  The 'E' command Erases tagged or untagged files at
your option, on a global scale.

  12. B0: CDP1	  .	 40K : E
Erase Tagged or Untagged files (T/U)? T
Do you wish to be prompted (Y/N/A)? N

Deleting  --> B0: BRUN	  .COM

     If  you specify Untagged files,  the untagged  files will be
erased.  You  may wish to be prompted before  each file is  to be
deleted, and you can do this via the second question.



Squeezing and Unsqueezing files

     The  'Q' command allows you to Squeeze and Unsqueeze  tagged
files.	This file squeeze program is compatible with the original
squeeze/unsqueeze programs written in the 'C' language by Richard
Greenlaw.  After hitting Q, you will see the prompt:

Squeeze, Unsqueeze or Reverse (S/U/R)?

     After  answering this  skill-testing question,  you  will be
asked  which drive/user you wish to place the destination  files.
The syntax here is the same as for the Move command, except it is
permissible  to  'Q' the files back to the same  drive/user  that
they originated.

NSWP 2	-   A disk maintenance utility


     When 'Q' is invoked, you are asked if you wish  to  Squeeze,
Unsqueeze  or Reverse.	A carriage return here will return you to
the command line of NSWP.

     If  you  select 'S' for Squeeze,  all tagged  files  will be
examined  to  see  if it is "worth" squeezing  them.  Files  that
exibit ANY space reduction,  even if it is only one sector,  will
be squeezed.  If the files is not "worth" squeezing the file will
simply be copied to the destination drive/user.

     If you  select 'U' for Unsqueeze, all tagged files  will  be
examined to see if they are squeezed.  If they are,  they will be
unsqueezed, and moved to the destination drive/user.  If they are
not squeezed, then they are simply copied.

     If you select 'R' for Reverse, all files that  are  squeezed
will  be  unsqueezed,  and all files that are unsqueezed will  be
squeezed  (if  it  is worth it),  and moved  to  the  destination
drive/user.

     The most attractive feature of the 'Q' command in general is
the ability to Squeeze files ONLY if it is "worth" it. This means
that  by  using  NSWP,	you can archive data  into  the  absolute
minimum amount of space possible.   The SQ algorithm used in NSWP
is better than the one in the original 'C' squeezer, and produces
the smallest output file possible with current technology.

     The file squeezer section was done by Jim	Lopushinsky,  and
is copyrighted	separately  by him.  He also has a public  domain
standalone squeezer.


Setting the tagged files status

     You  may set the attributes of a group of tagged files  just
like STAT, or PROT.  To do this, tag the files and select the 'Y'
command.

  12. B0: CDP1	  .	 40K : Y  Which flags (1-4,R,S,A)? R,S

Setting ---> B0: BRUN	 .COM to R/O SYS


     The  flags you may set are the F1-F4 flags,  as well as  the
Read Only,  System,  and Archive (MP/M,  CP/M 3 only) flags.  Any
flags  you do not specify will be reset.  To reset all the  flags
(i.e., Change to R/W, DIR and no "Sysop tag") just enter a single
comma or space at the "Which flags" prompt.  Note that the  flags
in the	"Which flags"  question do not have to be entered with	a
comma between them, as anything (or nothing at all!) will do.  As
far as the program is concerned  'RSA',  'R S A', and 'R,S A' are
all valid.

NSWP 2	-   A disk maintenance utility


			     Epilogue

     All the functions of NSWP have now been described.  The best
way to get more familiar  with the program is to actually USE it.
I think it will be one of your most frequently used programs.

     There  are several things in this version that you will want
to alter:

103H
This byte controls the screen length used in the 'V'iew  command.
It is currently set to 23D (17H).

104H-10AH - Turn reverse video on
The first byte in this sequence of seven shows the length of  the
reverse  video on sequence,  which follows at location 105H.  All
seven bytes are currently set to zero.

10BH-111H - Turn reverse video off
The  first byte in this seqence of seven shows the length of  the
reverse video off sequence,  which follows at location 10DH.  All
seven bytes are currently set to zero.


			     Credits

     My thanks to all who made this program possible and particu-
larly to Dave Mccrady for his help in composing the documentation
and .HLP files	for NSWP.  Thanks also goes  to Jim  Lopushinsky,
also of Edmonton, since without  him the SQ section of NSWP might
never have been completed!  Thanks  to the use of his SQ section,
NSWP can produce the smallest possible SQ'ed files.


			  Contributions

     If you like, use and enjoy this program, feel free to send a
contribution  (suggest	$20).	This  will help  me  expand  this
program, and add even more features.  I am currently working on a
CP/M 86 version, and once that is running, I intend to port it to
MSDOS.	Suggestions for enhancement are also appreciated, and you
may send them to:
