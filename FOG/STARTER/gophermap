                               | values of files you obtain from the library.
                               | Compare the values you obtain with CHECK
                               | against those listed in each "disk doc".

9DU-V89.ARK      13056  05-06-93  ver. 8.9 This disk utility allows you to	DU-V89.ARK
                               | modify any byte on a disk. With DU you may
                               | even rebuild a damaged disk directory. This
                               | program is not recommended for novices --
                               | they should first try to recover a damaged
                               | disk with NewSWeeP. Never work on your only
                               | copy of a disk and never practice on a disk
                               | you really need. The program and
                               | documentation are stored in an archive file
                               | to save disk space. Use UNARC.
9EDFILE.COM      11008  05-06-93  ver. 1/10/84 [EDFILE 1 of 2] Modify any disk	EDFILE.COM
                               | file, either in ASCII or hexadecimal, with
                               | ease. So easy-to-use that even novices can
                               | patch their software. Excellent for getting
                               | rid of an extra end-of-file marker (^Z or 1A
                               | hex) in your data file as well.

9FBAD57.COM       1792  05-06-93  ver. 5.7 [Findbad 1 of 2] Finds all the bad	FBAD57.COM
                               | blocks on a disk and builds a directory entry
                               | to ensure those blocks cannot be accidentally
                               | used. Recommended for use on every disk
                               | immediately after it is formatted
                               | (initialized). An absolute must for any disk
                               | which will hold permanent archival copies of
                               | your files and data.

                               | for CP/M 3.0 systems, this marks out bad
                               | sectors on your disks so they cannot be used.

9NSWP207.COM     11776  05-06-93  ver. 2.07 [NewSWeeP 1 of 2] Dave Rand's	NSWP207.COM
                               | fabulous file management utility. For anyone
                               | who needs to copy, view, print, rename, move,
                               | squeeze, unsqueeze, or erase files, either
                               | individually or in groups. NewSWeeP can also
                               | change the file attributes. On a CP/M 2.2
                               | machine, will recover files from a disk with
                               | the dreaded "BDOS Error" -- just press return
                               | every time you get the "BDOS Error" message.
                               | What NewSWeeP can't recover is probably gone
                               | forever and not worth spending the time on.
9RECVR21.COM      3328  05-06-93  ver. 2.1 [Recover 1 of 3] Unerase files which	RECVR21.COM
                               | have been erroneously erased. RECVR21 is for
                               | CP/M 2.2 machines; RECVR21X is for CP/M 3.0
                               | machines.

                               | 2.2 and CPM+ systems, this allows you to
                               | update the directory of your disk so that all
                               | files are organized alphabetically and all
                               | unwanted (erased) files are PERMANENTLY and
                               | IRRETRIEVABLY eliminated.

9SD130.COM        5248  05-06-93  ver. 13.0 [SuperDirectory 1 of 2] Use this	SD130.COM
                               | instead of the directory program which came
                               | with your computer. Be sure to read the
                               | documentation so you know about the many
                               | options which are available.

                               | programs written specifically for inclusion
                               | on this disk. Complete documentation, and
                               | most of the source code, is in the regular
                               | FOG-CPM library.
9UNARC.COM        4736  05-06-93  [File Extraction 1 of 4] Extract the members	UNARC.COM
                               | of an archive (.ARK or .ARC) file. Remember,
                               | .ARK normally signifies that the members are
                               | for CP/M systems and .ARC normally signifies
                               | that the members are MS/PC-DOS systems.

                               | with a `Z' as as the middle character of the
                               | extension are crunched -- this `Z' can also
                               | signify AZM source code.
