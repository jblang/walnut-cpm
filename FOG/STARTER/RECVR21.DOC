              RECVR21 Documentation File
     RECVR21 and RECVR21X are file un-ERAsers...to
use them, merely type RECVR21 or RECVR21X at the
system command prompt.
     The only difference between these two programs
is that RECVR21.COM is for CP/M 2.2 systems and
RECVR21X.COM is for CP/M 3.0 systems.
    The programs are menu driven, and as such
you should read the screen carefully at
each command you type in.  Typing a ? 
at RECVR's command prompt will result in
a menu being shown.  Use it in good health!
