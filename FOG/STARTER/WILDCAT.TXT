DU-V89.ARK    ver. 8.9 This disk utility allows you to modify any byte on a disk. With DU you may even rebuild a damaged disk directory. This program is not recommended for novices -- they should first try to recover a damaged disk with NewSWeeP. Never work on your only copy of a disk and never practice on a disk you really need. The program and documentation are stored in an archive file to save disk space. Use UNARC.
EDFILE.COM    ver. 1/10/84 [EDFILE 1 of 2] Modify any disk file, either in ASCII or hexadecimal, with ease. So easy-to-use that even novices can patch their software. Excellent for getting rid of an extra end-of-file marker (^Z or 1A hex) in your data file as well.
EDFILE.DOC    ver. 1/10/84 [EDFILE 2 of 2]
FBAD57.COM    ver. 5.7 [Findbad 1 of 2] Finds all the bad blocks on a disk and builds a directory entry to ensure those blocks cannot be accidentally used. Recommended for use on every disk immediately after it is formatted (initialized). An absolute must for any disk which will hold permanent archival copies of your files and data.
FBAD57.DOC    ver. 5.7 [Findbad 2 of 2]
FBAD58X.COM   ver. 5.8 [Findbad for CPM+ 1 of 2] Modified for CP/M 3.0 systems, this marks out bad sectors on your disks so they cannot be used.
FBAD58X.DOC   ver. 5.8 [Findbad for CPM+ 2 of 2]
NSWEEP.DOC    ver. 2.07 [NewSWeeP 2 of 2]
NSWP207.COM   ver. 2.07 [NewSWeeP 1 of 2] Dave Rand's fabulous file management utility. For anyone who needs to copy, view, print, rename, move, squeeze, unsqueeze, or erase files, either individually or in groups. NewSWeeP can also change the file attributes. On a CP/M 2.2 machine, will recover files from a disk with the dreaded "BDOS Error" -- just press return every time you get the "BDOS Error" message. What NewSWeeP can't recover is probably gone forever and not worth spending the time on.
RECVR21.COM   ver. 2.1 [Recover 1 of 3] Unerase files which have been erroneously erased. RECVR21 is for CP/M 2.2 machines; RECVR21X is for CP/M 3.0 machines.
RECVR21.DOC   ver. 2.1 [Recover 3 of 3]
RECVR21X.COM  ver. 2.1 [Recover 2 of 3]
SAPP20.COM    ver. 2.0 [Sort And Pack 1 of 2] For both CP/M 2.2 and CPM+ systems, this allows you to update the directory of your disk so that all files are organized alphabetically and all unwanted (erased) files are PERMANENTLY and IRRETRIEVABLY eliminated.
SAPP20.DOC    ver. 2.0 [Sort And Pack 2 of 2]
SD.DOC        ver. 13.0 [SuperDirectory 2 of 2]
SD130.COM     ver. 13.0 [SuperDirectory 1 of 2] Use this instead of the directory program which came with your computer. Be sure to read the documentation so you know about the many options which are available.
UNARC-CR.DOC  [File Extraction 4 of 4] Abbreviated documentation for the UNARC, UNARCA, and UNCR programs written specifically for inclusion on this disk. Complete documentation, and most of the source code, is in the regular FOG-CPM library.
UNARC.COM     [File Extraction 1 of 4] Extract the members of an archive (.ARK or .ARC) file. Remember, .ARK normally signifies that the members are for CP/M systems and .ARC normally signifies that the members are MS/PC-DOS systems.
UNARCA.COM    [File Extraction 2 of 4] Extracts members of archive files on 8080 systems.
UNCR.COM      [File Extraction 3 of 4] Extract files which have been compressed with either a crunch or a squeeze program. Remember, not all files with a `Z' as as the middle character of the extension are crunched -- this `Z' can also signify AZM source code.
