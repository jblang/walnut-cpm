Title: FOG-DOS Disk Library descriptions (disks 000 through 395).
Version: D1
?DISK DOC%000
^#10/01/88$N
@This STARTER.DOS disk contains some of the utilities which we
think are essential for FOG members with MS/PC-DOS systems.
File manipulation, disk recovery, file extraction, and much
more can be handled by these programs.
?CO.COM%000
^#$N
@Tiny PC Magazine program which allows menu-driven file
copying, deleting, and moving, with or without verification.
Mass operations with tagged files and a variety of sorting
options are also available.
?DR.COM%000
^#$N
@Tiny PC Magazine program to view text files (ASCII or
WordStar format) or delete, rename, or move any file, with or
with confirmation. Also allows sorting by name, extension,
size, or the date the file was last changed.
?RN.COM%000
^#$N
@Tiny PC Magazine program for managing subdirectories.
It displays a diagram of the subdirectories and then allows
you to move, rename, create, or remove a subdirectory. Also
hides and unhides, set or unsets the archive or read-only
bits, counts files, or loads DR program.
?PARKAL.COM%000
^PARKAL#1.0$N
@Parks the hard disk head(s) after determining how many drives
(and their size) you have.
?PKARC.COM%000
^Phil Katz Archive#3.5$Y
@Create ARChive files with this program. Note: this version
has been modified to default to the preferred FOG format for
use with submissions to FOG publications and libraries.
?PKXARC.EXE%000
^#$N
@Extract members of an ARChive file. Supports most compression
techniques and accepts wildcards.
?CACHE.COM%000
^Cache#$N
@Use this to increase the operating speed of your hard disk.
?PRN2FILE.COM%000
^Printer to file#1.0$N
@Captures output directed to the printer and writes it to a
disk file where it can be edited or printed separately. In
some cases, it can be a handy way to move data from encrypted
data file to another program.
?LIST.COM%000
^Buerg's List#6.2a$Y
@Full-screen viewing of (ASCII or WordStar compatible) text
files. It offers a wide variety of options, some of which can
be permanently patched.
?NSWP3.EXE%000
^NewSWeeP#3.019$N
@Dave Rand's file management program which allows copying,
deleting, viewing, printing, renaming, and much more. Many
options work equally with files and subdirectories. NewSWeeP
also allows these options with squeezed files or ARChive
files (except with squashed members) and will create new
subdirectories or "Zoom" into alternate subdirectories.
?WHEREIZ.COM%000
^WHEREIZ#$N
@Helps you locate files when you can't remember which drive or
subdirectory holds them. Accepts full names or wildcards.
?TREEG.EXE%000
^Graphics Tree#$N
@Displays graphic listing of the subdirectories on your disk
with subdirectory names in alphabetical order.
?FLIST.COM%000
^Formatting Lister#1.0$N
@Get nicely printed text files without a word processor --
this offers line width, page length, top, bottom and left
margin settings, with or without a heading, page numbers, or
a horizontal scale at the top of each page.
?SCRNSAVE.COM%000
^Screen Saver#$N
@This will blank your screen after three minutes of inactivity
without loss of data -- just press the <CTRL> key to bring
the screen back to view. Note that this program can cause
problems with some programs.
?MK.COM%000
^MasterKey#1.7c$Y
@A menu-driven disk patcher similar to Norton Utilities and
PC Tools. It has built-in help screens and will work with
either floppy or hard disks of any size. The unerase function
is excellent. Be sure to read the documentation before using
to patch a disk.
?UNERASE.COM%000
^UNERASE/DBACK#1.1$N
@Eric Gan's program to undelete files on most disks. Works on
disks up to 20Mb. Use DBACK before attempting to unerase.
?DBACK.COM%000
^#$N
@Backs up the FAT (File Allocation Table) and root directory
of a hard disk to a floppy disk. Also restores the FAT and
directory after a crash.
?SD6.COM%000
^SuperDirectory6#$N
@A directory program which allows you to specify how the files
are sorted and to "page" through a long listing.
?SEARCH11.COM%000
^Search#1.15$N
@A replacement for the DOS PATH command. Unlike PATH, this
program enables the use of programs with overlay and support
files. Note however that some programs will conflict with
SEARCH; it is therefore possible to disable SEARCH in a BATch
file or from the operating system prompt. The need for SEARCH
is much less now that most good software correctly reads the
PATH specifications. New users will probably NOT need this
program.
?SETPRN.COM%000
^Set Printer#$N
@Send setup codes and/or text directly to the printer.
?SIMCGA.COM%000
^Simulate CGA#$N
@Enables you to run many (not all) games which require CGA
(Color Graphics Adaptor) on a monochrome system. Be sure to
read the directions before attempting to use this program.
?UNWS.EXE%000
^UN-WordStar#$N
@Convert a WordStar file to standard ASCII text. (Check
FOGSCAN for other programs which do text conversion if this
doesn't do the job you need done. Text conversion is possible
between all major word processors but this is soley for the
user wanting ASCII rather than WordStar files.)
?LUE220.COM%000
^LBR Util Extractor#2.2$Y
@Use this to extract the members of a library (.LBR) file.
?DISK DOC%001

^EDWIN#1.0$N
@A RAM based text editor which works on close compatibles
only. A notable feature is for working with indented code --
it will find the first matching indent, greatly simplifying
the finding of errors in loops, etc. Version 1.5 is much
bigger and has therefore been placed on FOG-DOS.096
?DISK DOC%002

start these games until you are prepared to reset!

baby from an apartment fire. Requires graphics card.

version over the later one.

through the dungeon to find the Amulet of Yendor, then return
to the surface. As you travel you will meet various creatures
(most of them nasty), find objects (some having magical
properties), and experience many hazards in the dungeon
itself.
