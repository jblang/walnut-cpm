                             MB-KMD - Overlay List
                                      by

The following overlays are compatible with the current version of MB-KMD.
These overlays are designed to  handle the hardware-specific  aspects  of
the program.   MB-KMD allows a remote system to securely send and receive
files without anyone being present on the host system.

If you are running MB-KMD with the BYEBDOS equate set to NO,  you'll need
to choose one of the overlays below to patch  into the MBKMDnnn.HEX file.
You should take the following steps:


    1)  Edit the MBKMDnnn.ASM file to your own system's requirements.

    2)  Assemble it using MAC, ASM, LASM, M80, or SLRMAC to produce a
        .HEX file.  If using MAC to assemble, enter:

        MAC MBKMDnnn $PZ

    3)  Determine which of the  overlays  listed below best fits your
        own hardware configuration. You may need to edit the routines
        in an overlay that 'best' fits your requirements.

    4)  Assemble it to produce a .HEX file as above, making sure that
        that the resulting  KMxx-n.HEX file is no more than 128 bytes
        in size.  If it is larger than 128 bytes,  you'll have to set
        the LARGEIO equate in MBKMDnnn.ASM to YES and  equate LARSIZE
        to however many bytes long your KMxx-n.HEX file is.

    5)  Patch the two .HEX files together to make the MBKMD.COM file.
        The easiest way to do this is to use MLOAD.COM (also included
        in the MBKMDOVL.LBR) enter:

        MLOAD MBKMD=MBKMDnnn,KMxx-n

If you have a working overlay not listed above,  please send it to one of
the systems listed in the MBKMDnnn.ASM assembly file.  On the other hand,
if you have difficulties editting/creating an overlay for your particular
system,  give me a call and I'll be more than happy to  help you  make an
overlay.

                                                                2/15/87
