                 >>> 03/01/87 revision by Barry Miller <<<

The QX - Remote CP/M, T/PM  Systems List  is a collaborative work
of Barry Miller, Charles Zurenko and Norm Gregory.  Editors &
publishers  please note this list is (c) 1987 and the authors must
be contacted prior to any reproduction  (partial  or  whole)  of
this list  in any book, magazine or periodical that is sold on a
COMMERCIAL basis.

A summary of all known operating EPSON REMOTE CP/M, TP/M systems which
use Christensen protocol, (XMODEM),for file transfers and are available
to the general public for the exchange of public domain software.

*** Although most systems contained in this list operate on Epson ***
    equipment, the use of Epson equipment is NOT a list requirement.
    The authors make NO representations as to the degree to which
    any system listed supports Epson Computers.  It is our belief
    that the systems listed, maintain at least ONE user area devoted
    to Epson oriented software.

This list is updated quarterly. Please use the most recent to avoid ill-
placed calls.  Lists  are published  on a rotating schedule  beginning
with the  current author (see above) and continuing to the next on the
list: Barry Miller, Charlie Zurenko, Norm Gregory, Barry, etc.. List
are put out around the 1st day of each quarter but the actual date may
differ. Check with the next scheduled author. If sufficient activity
warrants, lists will be released with greater frequency.

[NOTES]

 1. Call-back systems are those where a computer and real people share
 the same telephone line.  To contact the people,  just dial & let the
 phone ring until you get an answer. To contact the computer: A) dial,
 B) let the phone ring once,   C) hang up just before the 2nd ring,  &
 D) re-dial.

 2.  Note that the 212A/Vadic 1200 baud modems may not  be  compatable
 with yours.  Some  of the above systems are using Vadic  3451  Triple
 modems,  compatable with  both Bell and Vadic Standard.  Sign on  the
 first time at 300 baud to determine  system  capabilities.  Note also
 that  PMMI's  can sometimes  be used over 300  baud  with  1200  baud
 systems.  PMMI baud rates are:  110,  300,  450,  600,  710  and  are
 indicated  above as "1-7".   Most of the 2400 baud systems are  using
 U.S. Robotics Courier Modems.  Thank you, US Robotics.

 3.  Use of an alternative long-distance service  should be considered
 when planning to  modem over long  programs.

 (Note, however, that you may  not be able to dial a system in Alaska,
 Hawaii or Canada depending on the service you get and  sometimes  you
 may have trouble connecting at 1200 or 2400 baud.)

 4.  Total on-line  disk capacity is shown for  reference.  Check  the
 system documentation for exact details when logging on.

 5.  All times listed are  local time,  please observe operating hours
 for systems with scheduled availability.

 6. If you  find any errors in this listing,  (or systems which do not
 support  XMODEM  protocol  for  file  transfers),  please forward the
 information to one of the systems listed at the top.

 7.  Some  of  the  private/semi-private  systems  will  allow  System
 Operators access to the system.  Each private/semi-private system has
 different  rules  regarding  access.   Contact  the  System  Operator
 first for details of system access, cost, etc.
