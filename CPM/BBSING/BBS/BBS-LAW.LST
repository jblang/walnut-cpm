Alabama

    As of July 1985, Alabama incorporated computer crime in its
theft of service provisions where computer services are included
in the definition of services. (Ala. Code Sec. 13A-8-10(b).) It
appears that Alabama has since enacted a computer crime statute
(Id. Sec. 13A-8-100). This new statute has yet to be analyzed and
summarized. Alabama also has a "prohibited instruments"
provision. (Id. Sec. 37-8-217.)


Alaska

    Since July 1985, Alaska has adopted a computer crime statute.
I have not, however, reviewed it in enough detail to provide an
analysis or summary. It can be found at Alaska Stat. Sec.
11.46.740 (1985) and applicable definitions can be found at Id.
Sec. 11.46.990.


Arizona

    Arizona has a "Computer Fraud" statute (Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann.
Sec. 13-2316). Under this statute, a person commits computer
fraud (1) in the first degree by accessing, altering, damaging or
destroying without authorization any computer system with the
intent (a) to devise or execute any scheme or artifice to defraud
or deceive, or (b) to control property or services by means of
false or fraudulent pretenses, representations or promises; and
(2) in the second degree by intentionally and without
authorization accessing, altering, damaging or destroying any
computer system or any computer software, program or data
contained in such computer system.

    Arizona's telecommunications fraud statute prohibits the
theft of telecommunications services through: (1) the
unauthorized use of telephone credit codes, trick or device; (2)
the publication (disclosure) of telephone credit codes; and (3)
the use, possession, sale, or transfer of a telecommunications
theft device or the plans and specifications for making the same.
(Id. Sec. 13-3707.)


Arkansas

    As of July 1985, Arkansas had no specific computer-related
statute. Arkansas also did not have a specific telecommunications
theft statute. The state's theft of services statute does,
however, include telecommunications services (Ark. Stat. Ann.
Sec.  41-2201(8).)


California

    California's computer crime statute prohibits access of any
computer with the intent to defraud, as well as maliciously
accessing, altering, deleting, damaging, or destorying any
computer system, computer program, or data. It also prohibits
intentional unauthorized access alone of any computer system,
computer program, or data and provides a civil remedy for the
owner or lessee of the computer system, computer program, or
data. (Cal. Penal Code Sec. 502.)

    California also prohibits obtaining telephone services with
intent to defraud, by unauthorized use of a telephone credit
code, trick, or device. It also prohibits the manufacture,
possession, sale, or transfer of a telecommunications theft
device and the publication of telephone credit codes. (Id. Sec.
502.7.)


Colorado

    The Colorado computer crime statute prohibits the use of a
computer for the purposes of theft of money, property, or
services, or to defraud. It also prohibits the unauthorized use,
alteration, damage, or destruction of any computer system.
(C.R.S. Sec. 18-5.5-102.) Although Colorado does not have a
specific telecommunications theft statue, it does have a statute
pertaining to illegal telecommunications equipment. (Id. Sec.
18-9-309.)

    Colorado recently passed a statute relating to "financial
transaction devices". Under this statute, a financial transaction
device is defined as a device that can be used to obtain
services. It is arguable that telephone services would be
included under this definition. (Id. Sec. 18-5-701.)


Connecticut

    The Connecticut computer crime law (1) prohibits the (a)
unauthorized access to a computer system; (b) theft of computer
services; (c) interruption of computer services; (d) misuse of
computer system information; and (e) destruction of computer
equipment, and (2) provides for (a) the right of an aggrieved
person to request appointment of a receiver who may seize the
computer equipment of one who has violated this statute; and (b)
the right of an aggrieved person to bring a civil action against
one who is alleged to have violated this statute. (Conn. Gen.
Stat. Sec. 53a-250.)

    Connecticut does not have a specific telecommunications theft
statute. Its theft of services statute does, however, include a
provision related to obtaining telecommunications services with
intent to avoid payment by trick, code, or device. (Id.  Sec.
53a-119(7).)


Delaware

    The computer-related statutes in Delaware apply to computer
fraud and computer misuse which prohibit the knowing and
unauthorized access of any computer system; obtaining
unauthorized computer services; disruption or degrading of
computer services or the denial of computer services to an
authorized user; the misuse of computer system information by (1)
displaying, using, disclosing or copying data residing in,
communicated, or produced by a computer system, or (2) altering,
deleting, tampering with, damaging, destroying, or taking data
intended for use by a computer system or interrupting or adding
data to a computer system; and the tampering with, taking,
transferring, concealing, altering, damaging, or destroying any
computer equipment. The statute also provides that an aggrieved
person who has reason to believe that any other person has been
engaged, is engaged, or is about to engage in an alleged
violation of any provision of the computer-related statutes may
bring an action to: (1) temporarily or permanently restrain and
enjoin the commencement or continuance of such acts; (2) order
restitution; or (3) order the appointment of a receiver who may
take into possession any property which belongs to the person who
is alleged to have violated any of the above provisions. (Del.
Code Ann. Title 11, Sections 931-39.)

    Delaware does not have a specific telecommunications theft
statute, but it does, however, have a statute prohibiting the
possession of, or dealing in, a device for unlawfully taking
telecommunications services (Id. Sec. 850). In addition, Delaware
has a statute which prohibits the publication of credit cards or
codes (Id.  Sec. 903).  Although this statue does not
specifically relate to telephone credit codes, Delaware's
definition of a credit card includes evidence of an undertaking
to pay for services (Id. Sec. 904).


District of Columbia

    There were no specific computer-related or telecommunications
theft statutes in the District of Columbia as of July 1985. The
theft statute, however, includes the theft of telecommunications
services (D.C. Code Ann. Sec. 22-3811).

authorized user. (Fla. Stat. Ann. Sections 815.01-.07)

    Florida has a statue specifically prohibiting the theft
of telecommunications services, as well as the manufacture, sale,
or transfer of a telecommunications theft device, or the plans
and instructions to make the same (Id. Sections 817.481-.483).
In addition, this statute prohibits the publication of telephone
credit codes.


Georgia

    The "Georgia Computer Systems Protection Act" prohibits (1)
the knowing and willful, direct or indirect, unauthorized access,

program or data. (Ga. Code Ann. Sections 16-9-90 to 95.)

    Georgia has a statute that prohibits: (1) avoiding charges
for the use of telephone services; (2) the manufacture,
possession, sale, or transfer of a telecommunications theft
device, or the plans or instructions for making the same; and (3)
the publication of the plans or instructions for such a device.
(Id. Sections 47-5-2 & 3.) Georgia also has a statute prhobiting
the publication of telephone credit codes (Id. Sec. 16-9-39).

July 1985. It can be found at Hawaii Rev. Stat. Sec. 708-890. It
has not yet been analyzed or summarized. Hawaii does not have a
specific telecommunications theft statue, though
telecommunications services are included as a service under the
state's theft of services statute (Id. Sec. 708-800). Hawaii also
has a statute which prohibits the manufacture, possession, use,
sale, or transfer of a telecommunications theft device (Id. Sec.

software shrinkwrap law. It basically allows shrinkwrap licenses
for microcomputer software provided the vendor follows the law's
disclosure requirements. (More detail will be provided later.)


Maine

    In Maine, the theft of computer and telephone services are
incorporated into the state's theft of services statute. (Me.

Massachusetts

    The latest information on Massachusetts showed that both the
House and the Senate had introduced proposed computer crime laws.
The Senate proposal generally prohibited the willful, knowing,
and unauthorized, with or without an intent to defraud,
modification, destruction, disclosure, use, taking, or damaging
of computer data, programs, or supporting documentation, or
computer equipment or supplies, as well as the denial of computer
services to authorized users. The House proposal was
substantially similar.

    The Senate bill had one interesting provision. It provided
that the functional owner of the computer system would be
responsible for the protection of that resource by instituting
acceptable physical security and computer system/network security
controls to protect the user of those resources.

    Massachusetts also has statutes relating to: obtaining
telecommunications services with the intent to defraud;
manufacturing, possessing, using, selling, or transferring a
telcommunications theft device, or the plans or instructions for
