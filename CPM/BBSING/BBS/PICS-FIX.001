6/29/87  After just releasing Pics vers 1.6 we discovered a bug that
affects the batch uploads (to Pics), causing the batch mode to terminate.
The problem has been traced to the 'checking for duplicates' message that
is printed (at both ends) for each file to be received. If you change the
following code and then re-compile your Pics files the problem will be
fixed. Pics 1.7 will contain this fix.

file: PICS2D.INC
line: 34

presently reads:

        writeln(usr); writeln(usr,'Checking for duplicates.. wait..');

replace line 34 with the following:

        if mode<>'B' then
          begin
            writeln(usr); writeln(usr,'Checking for duplicates.. wait..');
          end;

That's all there is to it. The message will be suppressed in batch mode.
