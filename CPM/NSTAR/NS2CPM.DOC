NSTOCPM.DOC as of 12-06-82

Changes in version 2:

-	Commands can now be lower case
-	NSTOCPM will not run on a 8080
-	NSTOCPM checks the OEM code of CP/M to see if it is running on
	a North Star implementation.

NSTOCPM.COM is a utility for copying North Star DOS files onto a CP/M disk.
Special features of North Star CP/M make this program independent of the
disk controller address. In order to run this program your system has
to meet the following requirements:
1. You have to have North Star CP/M on a Z-80
2. At least 2 drives
3. The DOS diskette and the files you want to copy MUST be double density.

If you do not have CP/M as delivered by North Star, NSTOCPM *MAY* work.
NSTOCPM will inform you if it can't run in your CP/M environment.

USE OF NSTOCPM

To execute the utility, simply enter NSTOCPM. Please note that all
commands typed to NSTOCPM will execute immediately! NSTOCPM will now
announce its presence and give you a brief rundown on your choices.
You will then be asked to input the DOS drive number. The number
must be between 1 and 4 or it will be rejected.
Next, you will be asked for the CP/M drive number, and both numbers
will be rejected if you enter any number other than 1,2,3, or 4, OR
if the CP/M drive is specified to be the same as the DOS drive.

Now you will be in command mode, with a "+" sign as prompt. You can
enter one of three commands:
D = display the DOS directory in DOS fashion
C = copy a file
Q = quit (warm-boot CP/M)

If you specify the <C>opy command, you will be asked for a DOS file name.
Enter the file name ONLY (without disk designator) and terminate with a
carriage return. The file name will be rejected if it is longer than 8
characters, empty, or if the file is not on the DOS disk.

After successful entry of the DOS file name you will be asked for a CP/M
file name. You can choose any CP/M file name you like, if the file name
is longer than 12 characters or empty it will be rejected. If the file
name is longer than 8 characters, everything after the 8th character is
treated as file type, i.e. "TOOLONGNAME" will become "TOOLONGN.AME."

After entering a valid CP/M file name, the CP/M file will be created,
overwriting any file already on disk by that name, and copying will
start. The DOS file is copied 512 bytes at a time. When finished, control
will return to the command prompt in anticipation of another copy.

When finished copying, type a "Q" at the prompt to return to CP/M.

Please note that file names in NSTOCPM MUST be made in UPPER CASE!
NSTOCPM will accept lower case COMMANDS. Use lower case for the DOS
file name, if the directory shows it in lower case. If you use lower
case for the CP/M file, you will have to run a disk utility to convert
the file name to upper case in order to use the file. NSTOCPM does not
perform any error checking on file names; it allows all characters to
be used, so be careful!

If the DOS disk is dual sided, but inserted into a single sided drive
and an attempt is made to copy a file on the back side, the results
are unpredictable, since the drive is not checked for DS operation.
The resulting CP/M file will most likely contain blanks.

IMPORTANT!

If you have a CP/M other than the one distributed by North Star,
NSTOCPM will tell you so and offer you a chouce to go ahead or
abort. It will do this only if the BIOS jump table has 18 entries!
In that case, WRITE-PROTECT all disks and go ahead. If you do a
<D>irectory and it comes up, you're fine. If not, NSTOCPM won't
work. You may now go ahead and determine the OEM code in your CP/M.
This code is located at BDOS+0 and BDOS+1. Using DDT, place the OEM
code into the following locations:
BDOS+0 into NSTOCPM 011DH
BDOS+1 into NSTOCPM 0123H
This will inhibit the "go-ahead" question when running NSTOCPM.
