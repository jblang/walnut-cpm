You may  (A)bort  or  (P)ause . . .

First, to get another .DAT file to run, you need to patch the filename at
location 105 in the .COM file with the new name, 8 characters.  You will
see it with GDT right at the start.
 
I have found that virtually all of the games, with the exception of
Trinity, Borderzone, Nord and Bert and A Mind Forever Voyaging work just
fine.  There may be a few more, but I don't know.  ALL THE ONES ON MY
DRIVE B: and F: work!  Most were bought as CP/M, but several are
converted.  I usually try to buy the MSDOS or Mac versions, as I have
machines available to convert using these formats.  If you cannot get
them converted, drop me a line, maybe we can figure out something for you,
like you mail me your originals and I will mail you back a CP/M copy.
 
I have a few Amiga and Commodore versions, but have never tried to convert
them.  Just got a copy from someone else, showed him my boxes and we
xmodemed the .dat files.
 
Good luck.  It is quite a quest.  PS, there is a company called Triton
which now distributes most of Infocom's stuff.  Don't have the number, but
could find it if you need.  They may have a 1-800.
