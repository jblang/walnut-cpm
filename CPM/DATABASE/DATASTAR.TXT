MY SURPRISE EXPERIENCE WITH FORMGEN AND DATASTAR
by Edward R. Elliott, Arizona KUG, May 1987

(A tip)

It all began when I had been using a form I called "log".  It was
a daily log I used each work day to track my time sheet the
company has us make out for our own time worked that day.  I felt
I could make a better "log", so I took an old log form and put it
in formgen and made it much better as far as information it would
handle by itself.  It still had the same four number key field
that tracked the month and day I worked.  Then, I started using
it at work instead of the old "log".  Well, as usual I hadn't
done all my homework and it refused to take in information,
claiming it had already data in on that date.  Here is what I had
forgotten to do to make this new log run smoothly.  I had the
previous year and it had data still listed for the dates I was
calling up.  Soooo! make sure you clear the "log.dta" file and
the "log.ndx" file or you will have a balk that is legitimate but
a puzzler till you look it over very carefully and discover your
dumb mistake.
