A few questions to those of you who know about the Zenith/Heath
machine (please reply to Schiffman@SRI-KL):

I have a friend who has a Z-19 and would like to transform it into a
CP/M runnable system.

	1) Is the Heathkit upgrade package for the H-19 (to convert it
	to the H-89) equally applicable to the Z-19?  (I'm pretty sure
	that the Z-19 and the H-19A differ only in the nameplate).

	2) What does that package consist of?  Is it only a handfull
	of parts or does it include new circuit boards?

	3) With that upgrade kit, you get 16K of RAM.  To get more RAM
	can you just plug in more chips, or do you need new circuit
	boards from Heath?

	4) Given that you buy the Heath diskette controller, can you
	then get the floppies elsewhere (namely are the Heath floppy
	drives vanilla or are they somehow special)?

Another way to phrase these questions is -- seeing I'm handy with
digital electronics and microprocessors, how can I help my friend
upgrade his Z-19 for the minimum amount of cash?

Pointers to documentation will be appreciated.  (I've already guessed
that buying the upgrade kit manual from Heath for $5 would be a good
start).

My h89 contains three major circuit boards:
1. Video controller board (analog)
2. Terminal logic board
3. Cpu board

The H19/Z19 (they are the same) contain 1 and 2.  I believe
the major component of the upgrade kit is the cpu
board.  The cpu board contains sockets for upt to 48K ram
(4116s).  FOr 64K you have to buy an upgrade board.
Feel free to ask any more questions, I'll try to answer them.

	I am not sure if the Heath upgrade kit can be used on the Z-19, but I
can give you some idea of the process, as I converted my H-19 a few months
ago.
	First, the upgrade kit consists of a new power supply and a cpu
board.  The power supply that comes with the H-19 is almost completely
removed.  The cpu board has RAM slots for 48K of memory, but you can piggy
back another 16K on top of 1 set of 16K.  The standard single side, single
density drive that they use is the Siemens FDD-100-5, and there are many
places that sell it for less than Heath.  Another expense that is probably
recommended is the 3 port SIO board.  The terminal part of the H-89 talks
to the computer board through the terminals UART (at up to 19.2Kb) so once
installed, you will need some way to communicate with the outside world.
You should also check whether you have the proper proms for running CPM.
If you want, I can give you the Heath part numbers for the new proms so that
you can check.  One thing that you might be interested in, the new power
supply can power two 51/4 floppies with no problem, which is useful if
you want to expand for the cost of a drive.
	If you have any other questions, get in touch.

Does anyone sell the upgrade kit cheaper than Heath?

I don't think anyone sells the upgrade kit except heath.

A few questions to those of you who know about the Zenith/Heath
machine (please reply to Schiffman@SRI-KL):

I have a friend who has a Z-19 and would like to transform it into a
CP/M runnable system.

	1) Is the Heathkit upgrade package for the H-19 (to convert it
	to the H-89) equally applicable to the Z-19?  (I'm pretty sure
	that the Z-19 and the H-19A differ only in the nameplate).

-------
	The Z-19 and H-19 differ in only that one was built in Michigan
	and the other is a kit.  The (A) suffix means that it is an
	upgrade, and also has a bunch of rf mods in it.  It is still
	functionally the same and can be upgraded with the old kit,
	but heath will say you have to wait.
-------

	2) What does that package consist of?  Is it only a handfull
	of parts or does it include new circuit boards?
--------
	The package consists of a standard H-88 pc board (CPU), power
	supply upgrade and fan.  All additional hardware to mount the
	and all wiring to make it work.  Also included is the manuals
	that will be needed.
-------

       	3) With that upgrade kit, you get 16K of RAM.  To get more RAM
	can you just plug in more chips, or do you need new circuit
	boards from Heath?
--------
	To go up to 48K, all you have to do is plug in more ram, and then
	change jumpers on the cpu card.  To go up to 64K, you will have to 
	get an addition PC board from Heath, or else-where, and the
	prom set.  The newer kits, however, already have the proms
	in them to allow up to 64K.
--------

	4) Given that you buy the Heath diskette controller, can you
	then get the floppies elsewhere (namely are the Heath floppy
	drives vanilla or are they somehow special)?
--------
	They are as vanilla as can be.  The only thing about the drives
	that Heath uses, is that they have a 30 ms. step rate, which
	is slow as hell.  The hard sectored controller will support
	double sided drives, although Heath doesn't support it.  There
	is a device driver from HUG which supports double sided drives
	on the controller.  It will also support high track densitys if
	you use the HUG device driver.  If he is running CP/M, then the
	BIOS code will have to be modified.
--------


Another way to phrase these questions is -- seeing I'm handy with
digital electronics and microprocessors, how can I help my friend
upgrade his Z-19 for the minimum amount of cash?
---------
	To give you and idea of what Heath does when you buy a
	H89, they will send you 4 to 5 boxes of kits.
	1 - H19 terminal kit
	1 - box containing the CRT tube of your choice
	1 - H88-1 upgrade kit
	1 - H88-17 Disk controller kit
	1 - Floppy disk drive
	and if you bye the total kit (H89) now they also include
	2 - Ram upgrade kits  (Total of 48k)
	1 - H88-3 Serial I/O controller
	1 - Rom upgrade kit to allow 64k

	As you can see, they just package a h19 with an upgrade
	kit to make the H89.  Good luck.  I just finished building
	one of these about 6 mo. ago.  Works well.  If you have any
	more questions, give me a shout.
--------

Pointers to documentation will be appreciated.  (I've already guessed
that buying the upgrade kit manual from Heath for $5 would be a good
start).
