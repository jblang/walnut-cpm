Re:   Heathkit H29 terminal specs

   From the new Heathkit catalog:

				   NEW
The user-comfortable H/Z-29 - much more video display terminal for
your money!

Only $599.00

* Emulates functions of many popular video display terminals -- and does
  even more!
* Detached keyboard design provides greater user flexibility
* Communicates at speeds from 75-19,200 baud, in half or full duplex
* A non-glare 12" diagonal CRT featuring greatly-improved video attributes

Affordable, state-of-the-art terminal: Here's what you get when you choose
the H/Z-29:

Full, sculptured 91-key typewriter-style keyboard: Features std.
128-character ASCII set and alternate character set is available with
super/sub-scripts, Greek symbols, VT-100 graphics and more.  Convenient,
separate 14-key pad for easier entry of numberic data.  Connects to tiltable
video monitor with 8' coiled cable (included).

N-key rollover to keep up with fast typists:  With this feature, many keys
can be depressed in rapid succession -- and the terminal will still process
all keystrokes in the correct order.

Auto-repeat capability:  All keys except BREAK, CAPS LOCK, CONTROL, SHIFT
and SETUP automatically repeat when held down for a second or more.  With
this time-saving feature, there's no need to press two keys to repeat the
same keystroke.

Improved video quality:  The H/Z-29 features an easy-on-the-eyes 25 line x
80 character 12" diagonal non-glare green display -- in normal or reverse
video, at half or full intensity.  You get easy-to-read characters as large
as 8 x 10 dots -- even on-screen underlining is provided on a per-character
basis!

The H/Z-29's cursor can be a blinking or non-blinking block or underline.
It can also be removed from the video display screen.

LED status panel:  Conveniently shows the terminal's "power on," "keyboard
lock," "off line" and "caps lock" status.

Easy-to-use, English-language set-up mode:  This means you don't have to
open the H/Z-29's cabinet to configure the terminal.  Replacing
hard-to-access internal DIP switches, the set-up mode allows the user to
configure the H/Z-29 to his unique performance parameters.  Set-up
parameters can be stored in non-volatile memory for permanent use, or the
terminal can be temporarily configured (default parameters return on the
next power-up).

Serial port connects the H/Z-29 to other peripheral devices:  A built-in EIA
industry Standard RS-232C Serial Interface Port allows you to enhance the
video terminal's versatility by connecting another compatible serial device.
Communicate at data transfer speeds ranging from 75-19,200 baud (certain
applications may require handshaking at 9,600 and 19,200 baud).

Keep track of time:  A 24-hour clock operates when power is supplied to the
H/Z-29, allowing the user to keep track of real time -- or elapsed time when
accessing a mainframe computer or time-sharing system.

Can also emulate:  The Lear Siegler ADM-3A and Hazeltine 1500A Video Display
Terminals for greater versatility in educational and office environments.
The H/Z-29 is also compatible with ANSI X3.64 and DEC VT-52 terminal
protocol -- and has many attributes of the popular DEC VT-100 Video Display
Terminal, including graphics.

Meets Federal Communications Commission Class B Radio-Frequency Interference
(RFI) requirements for home and business use:  The H/Z-29 also meets
applicable Underwriters' Laboratories (UL) and CSA requirements.

Available in easy-build, money-saving kit form:  All necessary components
are included with the kit, and an illustrated step-by-step Heathkit assembly
and operating manual shows you the way.

Kit H-29	$599.00
Z-29		$849.00
Palm Rest ... : Easily installs in front of the H/Z-29 Terminal's detached
keyboard component.	$15.00
-------------------------------------------------------------------
H/Z-29 SPECIFICATIONS: Microprocessor: 8051 eight-bit microprocessor.
Set-up: Set-up mode can allow custom parameters to be stored in non-volatile
memory for permanent use, or temporarily stored (default parameters return
on the next power-up).  Set-up mode can be locked by the user, preventing
others from changing often-used parameters.  Cursor: Blinking or
non-blinking block or underline.  Cursor may also be eliminated from video
display.  Tabs: Adjustable.  Self-testing: Automatically performed on each
power-up or reset.  Audible Feedback: Provided for the self-test "OK"
function, improper operation warning, key clicks and the ASCII bell
function.  Acceptable Temperature Ranges: Operating, 32 to 104 degrees F (0
to 40 degrees C); storage, -40 to +150 degrees F (-40 to +66 degrees C).
Acceptable Humidity Ranges: Operating, 10 to 90 percent; Storage, 0 to 95
percent.  Acceptable Altitude Ranges (above sea level): Operating, Up to
8,000 feet (2.4 kilometers); Storage, Up to 30,000 feet (9.1 kilometers).
Power Requirement: 120VAC, 60Hz.  Overall Dimensions: Keyboard, 3"H x 18"W x
7 1/4"D (7.62 x 45.72 x 18.42 cm); Video Monitor, 13 5/8"H x 15 1/8"W x 14
1/2"D (34.61 x 39.05 x 36.83 cm).
