I found this technique in REMark, the Heath Users Group Magazine.  The
trick is to imbed the escape sequences in a text file and then do a
TYPE filename to invoke the sequence. An undocumented feature of EDLIN
the line editor is that when in the insert mode pressing the F8 key
inserts an ESC ( ^[ is the symbol for ESCape) into the file.

The sequence to invoke wrap is ESCv
The sequence to invoke nowrap is ESCw

A sample EDLIN session is:

A:EDLIN WRAP.<return>       (Note the period after WRAP)
EDLIN Version 1.02 
New File
*I<return>
      1*<F8>v<return>
      2*<CNTRL C>
*E
A:TYPE WRAP<return>
A:                           (line wrapping now on)

Now make a file called NOWRAP substituting w for v

Other sequences are NOCLICK   ESCx2
                      CLICK   ESCy2

This is for ZDOS but I have done similar things on the CPM side.
You can use a screen editor if it has the capability of inserting
(usually called quoting) control characters.
