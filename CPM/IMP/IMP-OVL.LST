SUBJECT :  IMP overlay list

	IMP is the first (and with the commercial TERM3 the only) modem
program that takes advantage of the automatic 1k protocol offered by
KMD and XMODEM.  It also uses the automatic stepdown feature of the 2400
bps modems to adjust the computer speed to match that of the answering
system.  (The US Robotics only steps down from 2400 to 1200, not to 300.
The Hayes 2400, Racal-Vadic 2400, Paradyne, Prometheus ProModem 2400 and
others automatically stepdown from 2400 to 1200 to 300.  IMP takes full
advantage of this feature.)

	IMP was originally written for exclusive use with the new 2400
bps modems.  It was later expanded to accept 1200 bps modems as well.
It never was intended for use with 300 baud modems.

	At the bottom of this note is a list of the overlays that are
currently available for the IMP modem program.

	There are a number of options which the user may select to cus-
tomize IMP to suit his needs.  As with nearly any program, there may be
things you "wish you could do".  We tried to cover many of those, while
still keeping the overlays as short and simple as possible for "most of
the users".  An attempt was made to include enough features to allow
the sophisticated user enough tools to write his own routines if/where
appropriate, in the overlay.

	Read the IMP.CUS file for notes on how to select/use some of the
features offered in each IMP overlay.  (Such as changing the lead-in
character for the local commands while in the terminal mode to something
other than ESC, etc.)

	Others will be added as they are developed.  If you have a
	computer not already mentioned, you can perhaps use one of
	the above that matches your I/O (such as Dart, SIO, 8251,
	etc.) by selecting the correct ports, etc.  Otherwise you
	can try calling me at the below voice number from 10 am to
	midnight Pacific, and perhaps we can get something for you
	to use (then add it to this list for others).
