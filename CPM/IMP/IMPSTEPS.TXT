     The  step by step outline for IMP244.COM listed  below  is
meant   to  accompany  and  supplement  the  file   MEX-IMP.WMT
previously up-loaded to the KUDO Host.
Note:  At the present time the author knows of no  overlay  for
IMP that allows use of the Kaypro internal modem.

                            Step 1:

     You will need IMP244.COM and the appropriate overlay  file
for you computer/modem combination.  All of these files are  in
the library file IMP244.LBR except for the overlay. The library
contains a catalog of available overlays. The library also  has
a  file called MLOADxx.COM (xx=version number). You  will  need
this file also.

                            Step 2:

     Use  your  word processor or editor to read  through  your
overlay  file and make any changes that you need  to  customize
the  overlay for your computer/modem combination.  The  overlay
for  the  Kaypros is I2KP-1.ASM. There are a couple  of  places
that you will need to make changes. Read the discussion on  the
first page of the overlay concerning the screen clear character
and see if it applies to your machine. (The overlay is  correct
for  Kaypros) On the next page of the overlay there  are  about
three  lines  of comments that start "These  routines...".  The
changes  that  need  to be made  are  immediately  after  these
comments. The first is the line labeled MSPEED followed by a 5.
If you can operate at 2400 bps then leave this as is. Otherwise
select  the number that corresponds to you maximum modem  speed
from the comment and replace the 5. If you operate at 2400  bps
the line HS2400 should read YES and the line HS1200 should read
NO.  If  you operate at 1200 bps then make HS2400 read  NO  and
HS1200 read YES. Make both lines read NO if you operate at  300
or  slower.  If you use either a Prometheus  or  a  Racal-Vadic
modem  you'll  need  to  make changes  in  the  next  lines  as
appropriate.  If you have rotary phones instead of  touch  tone
you'll  need  to  change line TCHPUL to a P  instead  of  T  as
distributed. Save your changes an proceed to the next step.

                            Step 3:

     Place  your  overlay and ASM.COM on a disk and  enter  the
following: ASM I2KP-1<cr><== use name of your overlay.
     ASM.COM  will generate two files, one a .HEX file and  the
other  a  .PRN file. Before leaving this step read  the  screen
carefully  and make sure there are no error messages  generated
by ASM.COM.

                            Step 4:

     Place  IMP244.COM, the .HEX file generated in step 3,  and
MLOADxx.COM on a disk and enter the following:
            MLOAD IMP.COM=IMP244.COM,XXXXXX.HEX <CR>
IMP.COM  can  be replaced by any name that you want to  use  to
call  your  working  version of  the  program.  Substitute  the
filename of your .HEX file for the X's. MLOAD will generate the
file IMP.COM in this case, this is a working copy of IMP244.COM
ready to run with you computer/modem.

                            Step 5:

     As  distributed  IMP244.COM contains a  telephone  library
with quite a few of what seem to be west coast BBS's  included.
In  order  to  change the telephone library  to  YOUR  list  of
numbers  you  will  need the file  called  I2LIB.COM  from  the
IMP224.LBR. at the CP/M prompt enter the following:
                         I2LIB IMP.COM
I2LIB  will display the current telephone directory  from  your
copy  of IMP. It will ask if this looks okay and  then  display
its commands. To change an entry "A" for instance enter CA  and
you be prompted to change the telephone number identified  with
"A". After you finish making your changes enter "S" to save the
changes  and  your  numbers will be written  into  you  working
version of IMP.

                            Step 6:

    At  the CP/M prompt enter IMP<cr>. You should now have  IMP
running and have your cursor waiting for you at the IMP prompt.

                            Step 8:

     Time has come to make a call. Turn you modem on and  enter
this command:
                    CAL ID or CAL xxx-xxxx
IMP  will have the modem dial the phone number associated  with
the  ID you specify or it will dial the phone number  that  you
enter  at  the  command line. Adding a comma after  the  ID  or
number will cause IMP to try to dial this number until it  gets
through  or  until you abort the dialing with  a  Control-C.  A
slash  (/) after the number or ID will cause IMP to go  to  the
terminal  mode  as  soon  as connection  is  made  rather  than
prompting for a key press for terminal mode. You can also  have
IMP try several numbers until it gets through by including  the
ID's  on  the  command  line with either a  comma  or  a  slash
separating each number or ID.

                            Step 9:

     If  this  is your first contact with a  new  board  you'll
probably want to open a capture file so that you can get a hard
copy of all the material that the remote is going to spew  out.
If  you are already in contact with a remote system  you  start
the capture file as follows:
          a.) ESC E {gets you back to command mode}
          b.) T filename.ext {back to terminal mode with a file
open by the specified name.
     Another  option  is to open the capture  file  before  you
start the call, like this:
            a.) T filename.ext {opens the capture file}
            b.) ESC E {gets you back to command mode}
            c.) CAL ID
As soon as the remote system answer IMP will go to the terminal
mode  with  the capture file open. A colon will appear  on  the
screen  at  the  start of each line as an  indicator  that  you
capture  file  is working. IMP uses a 16K  capture  buffer  and
every  16K  it will briefly suspend things while it  writes  to
disk.

                           Step 10:

     As  you  look around through the files of the  remote  you
will  probably come across programs that you would like to  add
to  your  collection. You should find out if the remote  has  a
help  file for downloading and copy it into you  capture  file.
After you get off line read through the instructions or  better
yet  print the instructions out so you'll have it  beside  your
keyboard when you try your first download. Procedures will vary
from  system to system but downloading will go  something  like
this:

     a.)  xmodem s du:filename.ext<cr> <== you enter  this,  du
can  be  omitted if you are logged on the drive and  user  area
that has the file you want to download. If the remote  supports
the new 1K protocol you will want a "k" after the "s".
     b.)  The  remote will display some information  about  the
transfer  and then tell you that the file is open and ready  to
send.
     c.) Enter ESC E {you're back in command mode}
     d.) Enter rt filename.ext<cr> you can include a drive  and
user  area  if you wish the file to be placed  on  a  different
drive  or user area than you are currently logged to.  The  "r"
tells  IMP  to receive a file, the "t" tells it to go  back  to
terminal mode when the transfer is completed. If you are  using
the 1K protocol put a "k" between the "r" and "t".

                           Step 11:

     Sending a file to the remote is also fairly simple.  Again
exact  procedures  may vary slightly from board  to  board  but
it'll go something like this:
     a.)  xmodem r filename.ext<cr> <== tells the  remote  that
you are sending it a file.
     b.)  The remote will tell you it has a file open ready  to
receive.
     c.) ESC E
     d.) st filename.ext<cr> <== IMP will send the file and  go
back  to terminal when the transfer is complete. A "k"  between
the  "s"  and  "t"  will cause the transfer to  go  in  the  1K
protocol.

Note: If you have a capture file open IMP will ask you to close
the  file when you enter the command mode. IMP will  present  a
list  of  options for you to use. WRT will save what  has  been
captured to this point.

                           Step 12:

     After  you sign off from the remote and after  the  remote
drops  its carrier you want to enter ESC E to get back  to  the
command  mode.  Now enter WRT<cr> to close  your  capture  file
properly.  You can now exit from IMP with EXIT<cr> or go on  to
make more calls.
