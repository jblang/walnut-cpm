
EPEX v1.1

So far I have been very impressed with James Whorton's new
EPEX enhancement.  I have found a couple of annoying bugs
which Jim is going to fix in the next release version.

Going from full-blown ZCPR3 to the EPEX system was easy,
most everything is duplicated including named directories
and du: prompts, etc.  


Problem #1:

Anyone used to ZCPR3 will notice the first time they enter 
a user number and colon to change user areas -- you will 
get a BDOS SELECT ERROR.

  ex:     A0:[ROOT]>1:

you can however change drive/user areas with the familiar
du: command or by using the directory name and a colon.

  ex:     A0:[ROOT]>A1:    or    A0:[ROOT]>WORDPRO:

The above example assumes that the A1: area has been assigned
a name of WORDPRO with the MKDIR utility.



Problem #2:

The next problem I have encountered is that you can use lower
case letters in your SYSTEM.DIR file for directory names and
then you CANNOT change areas with the directory name and a colon.

You edit a file called SYSTEM.DIR with any ASCII text editor,
it is made up like so:

A0:ROOT
A1:WORDPRO
C0:FLOPPY

and then you use MKDIR to 'load' this description into memory
like so:

	A0:[ROOT]>MKDIR SYSTEM.DIR

This all works fine if the directory names were entered in UPPER
case only, if you use lower case it will be displayed in the
prompt in lower case like so:

	A0:[root]>

but you cannot use the following command to return to the A0:
file area with an '?' error message.

	C0:[floppy]>root:

-------------------------------------------------------------
Solution:  Use only UPPER case letters in your dir names 
-------------------------------------------------------------


I have EPEX running on my Kaypro 10 with Advent TurboROM and
DATESTAMPER enhancements and it functions fine except for the
pair of annoying bugs I just described.  Look for fixes in
the next version.
