Re   : NUBYE v1.01 modification

   Many users routinely hit CR's when logging onto a system -- since
NUBYE currently accepts a CR at the nulls question, this can cause
those users to get the default nulls (and they may not have a chance
to reset them without calling back).
   Remove the code marked with "==>>" below and this will prevent
any response other than numerical to the nulls question.

;
ASKNL0: LDA     NULTRY
        CPI     12              ; Retry limit? (allow for noisy lines)
        JZ      PREOFF          ; Yes, else continue
        INR     A
        STA     NULTRY          ; Increment counter and save it
        LXI     H,NULMSG        ; Nulls message
        CALL    PRINTB          ; Send it
        CALL    MINPUT          ; Get value
==>>    MVI     C,'0'           ; Default 0 nulls               <<== remove
==>>    CPI     CR              ; Default ok?                   <<==   "
==>>    JZ      $+14            ; Yes, so skip next 5 lines     <<==   "
        MOV     C,A
        CPI     '0'
        JC      ASKNL0          ; Bad, retry
