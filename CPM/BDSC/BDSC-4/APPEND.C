	Written by Leor Zolman, BD Software, 9/82

	Usage:
		A>append  <new_text>  <dest_file> 

	Appends the given new text onto the existing dest file,
	using CP/M 2.2x random-record I/O to keep from having to
	read through the entire destination file.

	The new-text file is loaded into memory before appending,
	so it has to be short enough to fit into memory.

	If the dest-file doesn't exist, it is created anew.
