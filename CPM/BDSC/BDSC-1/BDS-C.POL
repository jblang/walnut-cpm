Re:   update policy

Simply, my policy is that ANYONE who EVER pays real money for BDS C,
purchased ANYWHERE, is perfectly entitled to copy anyone else's newer
version with my blessings. Note that NO ONE should EVER have to go to
Lifeboat for updates...PLEASE tell your friend to join the user's group
so he can get the newsletters and CHEAP updates. You should join and
do likewise, ifyou haven't already!
