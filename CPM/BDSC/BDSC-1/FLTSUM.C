	This program is a simple example of how to use
	Bob Mathias's floating point package.
	After compiling this and the FLOAT.C library, link by saying:

	A>clink floatsum -f float <cr>

	Note: the "printf" function resulting from this linkage
	will support the "e" and "f" floating point conversion
	characters, but the regular "printf" would not. The reason:
	the special version of "_spr" in the FLOAT.C source file
	is loaded before the library version of "_spr", and
	thus supports the extra features.
