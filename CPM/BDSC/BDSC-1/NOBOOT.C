	NOBOOT.C	written by Leor Zolman
			3/82

	Given a list of C-generated COM files (linked with the standard
	distribution version of the C.CCC run-time package), this program
	changes those COM files so that they do not perform a warm-boot after
	their execution is complete, but instead preserve the CCP (Console
	Command Processor) that is in memory when execution begins and
	return to the CCP directly following execution.

	NOTE: If a command is the object of a pipe operation using DIO,
	then a warm-boot will always occur after its execution, whether
	or not NOBOOT has been applied to it.
