             Government Publications
              by Ceceile Kay Richter

The U.S. Government Printing Office (GPO) executes 
orders  for printing and bookbinding placed by the 
Congress and the departments and organizations  of 
the Federal Government.  At any one time, approxi- 
mately 16,000 different GPO publications,  ranging 
from  simple  black  and white booklets  to  fancy 
clothbound  full-color books,  are  available  for 
public  sale through mail order from the  Superin- 
tendent  of  Documents in  Washington,  D.C.,  and 
directly from 24 government bookstores around  the 
country.  
The  GPO issues on a quarterly basis a very attrac 
tive, illustrated, sales catalog, "U.S. Government 
Books." Each issue features annotated listings  of 
almost  1,000 popular Government books arranged by 
subject categories such as Business and  Industry, 
Careers, Education, History, and Science and Tech- 
nology,   as  well as several pages of Recent  Re- 
leases.   Since May 1984 one of the categories has 
been  Computers and Computer  Science.   Prior  to 
that  time -- the "Catalog" goes back to September 
1982 -- computer books were listed under the cate
gory Science and Technology.

Recently, while at the University of Alaska, Anch- 
orage, library, I went through their collection of 
"U.S.  Government  Books"  catalogs  and  recorded 
selections from the category Computers and Comput- 
er  Science that I thought would be of interest to 
ANKOR newsletter readers and other users of micro- 
computers.   I  also recorded ordering information 
for those selections.  Then, since the catalogs go 
back  to 1982,  the librarian directed me  to  the 
latest  bimonthly GPO Sales Publication  Reference 
File  (PRF)  to  verify current  availability  and 
prices.

What  a  find that was.   The PRF  is  a  complete 
master  file on microfiche of GPO publications for 
sale,  (The  PRF  is also available  online  as  a 
component  of  the Lockheed  Corporation's  DIALOG 
Information  Retrieval  Service.)  I  checked  the 
ordering  information for the titles I had  listed 
and also recorded several additional listings that 
were  under  the PRF's subject headings  Computer, 
Computers, and Microcomputers. 

My listings appear below.    The category headings 
and  title groupings are of my own design and  you 
will  not find them in any GPO  catalog.   I  have 
adapted  the individual book descriptions from the 
annotations in the catalog "U.S. Government Books"  
and the PRF.  My listings are not exhaustive but I 
do  think  I have selected the  publications  that 
would  be  of  most interest to  readers  of  this 
newsletter.   If  you would like to pursue one  of 
these  categories in greater  detail,  or  another 
category,  you  are encouraged to investigate  the 
"Catalog" and the PRF yourself.  

With  the exception of free promotional  materials 
like  the "U.S.  Government Books" catalog,  there 
are no free books distributed by the  GPO.   Every 
item  in  its inventory has a price which  enables 
the  sales  program to operate without  using  tax 
revenues.  Purchase prices, however, appear modest 
given the size, format and quality of the publica- 
tions involved,  and the fact that mail-order post 
age is included in each price.

For  those  of you desiring to order  any  of  the 
books listed below,  you may do so by mailing your 
order to:   Superintendent of Documents,  U.S. Gov 
ernment  Printing Office,  Dept.  33,  Washington, 
D.C.  20402.   Your order form should contain your 
name and address,  the shipping address if differ- 
ent,   home and office telephone numbers,  and for 
each  book  it's Stock Number (shown as  a  number 
preceded   by "S/N" at the bottom of each  listing 
below),  quantity required, the title, unit price,  
and  total price for the  quantity  ordered.   You 
should also show the total price of your order and 
enclose  a  check for that amount made payable  to 
the Superintendent of Documents.   Orders may also 
be charged to VISA or Master Card. 

If priority mail shipping is desired,  you need to 
find the additional costs in advance by  telephon
ing the GPO at 202/783-3238 and then indicating on 
your  order the special postage  desired.   Charge 
orders may be placed over the telephone by calling 
that number.   Hours of the Printing Office are M-
F,  8 a.m.  - 4 p.m.,  Eastern Time.  You may also 
write to Dept.  33 for a copy of "U.S.  Government 
Books."   My experience is that the GPO will  send 
you the latest copy available at the time you make 
your  request but they will not send you  editions 
on a regular basis.  

If you have not received an order within approxi- 
mately seven weeks, you may write to: Publications 
Service Section,  Stop SSOS, U.S. Government Print 
ing Office,  Washington,  D.C.  20402 or telephone 
202/275-3050.  Availability and current prices may 
also  be verified by calling that telephone number 
or  you may wish to check such information on  the 
PRF at the UAA library.  

If  in Seattle,  you may wish to visit the Govern- 
ment Bookstore there where you may browse  through 
the  shelves  and take your book  purchases   home 
with  you.   The Seattle  retail outlet is in Room 
194  of the Federal Building,  915 Second  Avenue.  
Hours are 8 a.m. - 4 p.m. local time.  

The UAA library is a government documents  deposi- 
tory  library.   This  means that  the  government 
documents librarian,  Mr. Alden Rollins, can stock 
the University library with publications he wishes 
from  the GPO's Monthly Catalog of Government  Pub 
lications.   In  1985 he had some 26,757 pieces to 
select  from.   Whether  any of the  books  listed 
below  are available at the UAA library  shall  be 
left to the interested reader to determine.
