I bought iLISP back in late 84 (v-2.0) and have had alot of fun with it
and hopefully learning something. This version is surprisingly capable.
Some bugs have shown up that might be useful to report.
 
The function ARCTAN has been found to have a rather sneaky error - with
arguments of less than 1.0 the answers are half of the correct angles.
Check this out. If needed the easy patch is to define the function ATN
as follows:
      (DEFINE ATN (X) (IF (< x 1) (* 2 (ARCTAN X)) (ARCTAN X)))
 
This definition as well as other common trig functions I put in a file
used by SETUP to create LISP.COM to make them permanently available.
 
The function LISTFILE has a characteristic which makes the printer spit
out an initial blank sheet, or formfeed. This can be easilly corrected
in the DEFINE statement with a conditional -
          (IF (EQ LF 'CON:) (OUTB 12))
so that you get CLS initially, but not a printer FF. Similarly, you can
add an eject FF at the end by putting -
          (IF (EQ LF 'LST:) (OUTB 12))
just before the CLOSE statement.
