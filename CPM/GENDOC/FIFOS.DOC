No, no one else makes the TRW 1030.  The Z8060 is a real part but
slo-ooow (over a microsecond cycle time).  2812 sort of sounds like an
Intel number.

After years of domination of the FIFO market by MMI with their dinky
64x4 and 64x5 bubble-through FIFO's, the market has finally stabilized
on an good FIFO architecture with good performance:

Mostek	4501	512x9	200, 150, 120, 80 ns access time

IDT	7201	512x9	120, 80, 65, 50 ns
	7202	1024x9	120, 80, 65, 50 ns


For reference the MMI parts are the 67401 (64x4) and 67402 (64x5),
with similar parts made by Cypress, Fairchild, and National.  TI's got
some 16x4 and 16x5's (74LS222, 224, 227, 228, 74S225), but they are
small.

Here's some prices, current as of about April of 1984 (slightly old):
