                              COMM180
                    Modem/SCSI Peripheral Board



     The Micromint COMM180 expansion board may be the only board
 you will ever need for your SB180 computer.  This 4" x 5" board
 adds two major functions to your SB180:

     1) Bell 103-212A compatible 300/1200 baud modem
        with Dual Tone Multi-Frequency (DTMF) encode/decode
        capability and voice synthesis
     2) SCSI hard disk controller interface

     The COMM180 board is available in three versions:

     1) Modem, DTMF encode/decode, and voice synthesis alone
     2) Small Computer System Interface (SCSI) hard disk
        controller interface alone
     3) Both of the above

 And either the modem version or the SCSI controller version may
 be upgraded to the full version at any time.

     The COMM180 does not use a serial port on the SB180, but
 instead addresses the bus directly.  It is fully Bell 103 and
 Bell 212A compatible (including FCC registered Data Access
 Arrangement) for 300 and 1200 baud use, is 8251A software compat-
 ible, features both DTMF and pulse dialing, call progress mon-
 itoring, DTMF reception and decoding, and a unique diagnostic
 capability which automatically compensates for common telephone
 line deficiencies.  In addition the COMM180 has optional voice
 synthesis capabilities which allow it to respond verbally to
 commands entered via the standard touch tone telephone pad.

     The SCSI allows the use of a wide variety of hard disks with
 the SB180 for fast, sophisticated mass storage whether you need
 just 5 megabytes or 50 megabytes.  Many manufacturers offer hard
 disk drives and controller cards which mate with the SCSI inter-
 face.  If you need more file space than floppies allow, the
 COMM180 board can help meet your storage needs.  In addition,
 many laboratory instruments support the SCSI standard, thus the
 COMM180 can allow the SB180 to be more easily used for data
 logging and data reduction.

     Software for the COMM180 includes a complete modem commun-
 ications system and messaging system designed to run under Z-
 System DOS available for the SB180.  BIOS modifications are
 supplied in source code to allow integration of hard disk drivers
 into the Z-System DOS.

                         COMM180 Software


     The software which comes with the COMM180 consists of TERM
 III and Z-MSG (optional).

      TERM III is a sophisticated communications package which
 offers all the functions of standard modem programs but goes far
 beyond them when used with COMM180's advanced features and Z-
 System DOS (required for operation).  TERM III was designed to be
 used as:

 1) an originating communications system to allow the user to
    dial out, communicate with other computers, and perform
    file transfer functions;
 2) a remote access system to allow users to dial into the
    system, interact with it, and transfer programs into
    and out of it; and
 3) a configuration system to allow the user to configure the
    attributes of the other two types of systems.

 TERM III offers multiple file transfer protocols: Christiansen's
 MODEM7 (with checksum and with CRC), MODEM7 batch, XMODEM, KER-
 MIT, CompuServe's CIS, and X-ON/X-OFF.  Special attention has
 been paid to making the remote access system completely secure
 from unauthorized use.  You may also call in to TERM III on the
 COMM180 and use a standard touch tone pad to give special
 instructions, e.g., run a program using the COMM180's speech
 synthesis to give a verbal summary of system access.

     Z-MSG allows the COMM180, SB180, and TERM III to be custom
 configured as a "turnkey" Remote Bulletin Board System - either
 as a public system allowing access to anyone or as a private
 system restricting access to "members only".  Z-MSG allows up to
 eight user "types" with varying priveleges associated with each.
 Messages may be public or private and may be over 100 lines long.
 Extensive editing functions are provided and comprehensive on-
 line help is always available.


     For those wishing to use the SCSI as a hard disk controller,
 source code is provided which allows many types of hard disk
 controllers and sizes of Winchester disks to be used as mass
 storage for the SB180.  Two popular controllers are supported
 directly - the Xybec 1410 controller and the high performance
 Adaptec ACB4000.  Two disk sizes are supported - the standard 10
 MB drive as well as the high capacity 20 MB drive.  Provisions to
 support other controllers and even higher capacity drives are
 included.  Of course, the SCSI may also be used to link other
 SB180's or SCSI equipment together as well.
