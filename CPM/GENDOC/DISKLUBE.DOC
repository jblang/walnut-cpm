Re:   Shugart disk drive lubrication

I recently received some valuable info re lubrication of
Shugart 8" drives, prompted by intermittant squeaking from
a drive!  Carefully, spray a small amount of aerosol sili-
cone lubricant on the lead screw (without getting it all
over the place!)  I was amazed at the noise reduction I saw
immediately.  According to my source, Shugart has done this
themselves in spite of no mention in service manuals.  It
certainly hasn't hurt my drive operation.  Don't use a
lubricant with any petroleum base... pure silicone (food
grade) only!  The brand I have is called Sprayway, from
Sprayway, Inc., Addison, Ill 60101.
