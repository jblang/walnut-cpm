Many people who use the BBS systems are programmers and are
experienced in the technical minutia of hardware and software.
There are many computer magazines which currently need articles
written on a myriad of subjects concerning computer hardware
and software, which is more often than not baffling to the novice
or those who use computers for limited purposes (i.e., word
processing, data base applications, spreadsheets, etc.), but wish
to become more familiar with "computerese."  Those who understand
computers may wish to write an article or two for publication in
a computer magazine (and, in the process, stand to make some
money).  The following text is a crash-course in manuscript
conventions.  These conventions should be followed (they apply
to all manner of writing for publication); a well-organized
and readable manuscript will be read by an editor, while one
that is not, more likely than not, will be passed over.  Note:
Editors, like computer programmers, are turned-off by sloppy
and novice-appearing work.

PAPER

You should always use WHITE, 8 X 11 inch paper (computer paper is
OK), 20LB standard weight bond (the same weight as looseleaf or
typing paper).  Don't use erasable bond or cheap paper (the kind
with high wood content).  If possible, use 25% cotten fiber paper.
Editors like smooth paper which shows type clearly.  The better
quality papers will also take correction fluid better (that is if
you miss a mistake in the editing process of writing your article).
NEVER USE ONIONSKIN PAPER OR ANYTHING LESS THAN 20LB!

FILE COPIES

Since you'll more than likely be using a word-processing program
(or maybe an MS-DOS EDLIN program) to write your article, you
probably won't need to worry about saving a file of your article.
It should be stressed, however, that COPIES ARE IMPERATIVE, since
you may not ever see your manuscript again once it is sent out
through the unpredictable mails (or, less likely, an editor loses
it; editors, it must be added, are NOT responsilbe for unsolicited
manuscripts).

SELF-ADDRESSED, STAMPED ENVELOPES (S.A.S.E.)

ALWAYS enclose a self-addressed, stamped envelope for the return
of your manuscript.  If you don't want your manuscript back, include
a postcard or letter envelope with the correct amount of postage
so the editor can respond to your article.  A SUBMITTED ARTICLE
WITHOUT AN S.A.S.E. IS THE SIGN OF A NOVICE!  Even professional
writers who make thousands of dollars a year on articles or stories
include an S.A.S.E. with their submission.  IT IS IMPORTANT TO
MAKE SURE YOU AFFIX CORRECT POSTAGE TO THE ENVELOPE SENT TO A
MAGAZINE (since the magazine will have to pay postage due).  A
submission arriving with postage due will be greeted with disdain
by an editor --- careful writers ALWAYS make sure the right amount
of postage is affixed.

FOLLOW THE DOUBLE-SPACE LAW

All manuscripts MUST be double-spaced.  A double-spaced manuscript
is easier to read and editors invariably suffer from eye strain.
Again, if you don't follow the rules, you will be passed over as a
novice.

THE DOT-MATRIX TABOO

Most editors hate dot-matrix (except near letter quality).  Dot-matrix
is nearly impossible to read and the descenders (i.e., the descending
part of a "g" or "p" which falls below the line) are crunched up on
dot-matrix.  This drives an editor nuts and he will probably send
your manuscript back with a terse note.  Some editors, however, will
read dot-matrix; always send a query (again, with return postage)
asking if dot-matgrix is acceptable.  AND ALWAYS MAKE SURE YOUR
RIBBON IS DARK!  Trying to read a manuscript with light type is like
trying to read a telephone book by candle!

TYPE FONTS

Use standard type styles.  Never use script or unusual type styles.
Acceptable type fonts are: PICA, COURIER, or LETTER GOTHIC.  Make
sure the pitch is fairly wide.  Again, make your manuscript as
readable as possible.  An editor is not impressed by fancy and
proportional type.

PAGE FORMAT

Do not use a cover sheet or a binder on your manuscript (unless
it is a play or television script).  Always put your name and
other information in the upper lefthand corner of the first page:

        Joe Hacker
        123 Main Street
        Anyville, MI 10000
        (313) 555-5656

These lines should be the ONLY single-spaced type in your manuscript.
In the righthand corner of the manuscript, indicate an approximate
word count (most word-processing programs include this), the rights
you are offering for sale (i.e., "First Serial Rights"), and your
copyright notice (i.e., (c) 1987 Joe Hacker).  On every page after
your first, include a "slugline": your full name, a dash, the title
of your manuscript (if a long title, use key words), another dash,
and the page number.  The margins of your manuscript should be about
1.25 or 1.50 inches.

This is what your manuscript should look like:

-------------------------------------------------------------------


        Joe Hacker                              About 3,000 words
        123 Main Street                         First Serial Rights
        Anytown, MI 10000                       (c) Joe Hacker
        (313) 555-5656

                     UNDERSTANDING COMPUTERESE

                                By

                            Joe Hacker




                Computerese is a language that all cannot readily

        understand.  An explanation is in order.  First off, try


___________________________________________________________________

        Hacker -- COMPUTERESE -- 2

        [2 double spaces]

        And while some people have the intelligence of above-

        average primates when it comes to computers, others

Follows these conventions and make sure your manuscript is NEAT
in appearance, and you can be assured that an editor will at least
read it; the sloppy, unprofessional manuscript will always be
sent back --- and usually without comment!  And since you are not
interested in wasting your time (or the editor's), it is smart
to follow these manuscript conventions and spare yourself the
frustration of finding a returned manuscript.

Of course, your manuscript might be neat and be completely devoid
of substance --- or be written clumsily --- but at least it will
be read!

Good luck!
