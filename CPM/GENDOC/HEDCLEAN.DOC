SHUGART DOES NOT RECOMMEND CLEANING DISKS

The following is reprinted from a Shugart Service Memo (#2,
dated January 27, 1981) and was submitted by Hugh Turner.

"There have been numerous inquiries from our customers
concerning Shugart's stand on cleaning diskettes.  Our Media
Engineering group has finished it's testing on several
cleaning diskettes and determined that they do not meet our
engineering specifications, for the following reasons:

*  The cleaning diskettes are too abrasive and are not as
flexible as the media.  This causes the diskette to deteri-
orate the head between 5-10uin horizontally and between
2-15uin vertically.

*  The cleaning diskettes do not comply with the side 0 button.
Due to the flexibility of the cleaning diskettes, side 0 was
only cleaned where the side 1 rails hit side 0.  The side 1
head was not cleaned on the taper surface of the head.

*  These results were seen after ten minutes which simulated
twenty cleanings of 30 seconds each.

BASED ON THE ABOVE TEST RESULT IT IS SHUGART'S RECOMMENDATION
AT THIS TIME NOT TO APPROVE OR RECOMMEND ANY CLEANING DISKETTE.

If customers continue to use a cleaning diskette they may run
the risk of voiding their warranty.  Test results show that
the cleaning diskettes will blend the side 0 head causing media
wear under normal usage.  The corrective action for this
problem is to replace the complete head assembly at the
customer's expense.

Our Engineering group is conducting on going evaluations with
several vendors to correct the above discrepancies in order
to approve some type of cleaning diskette in the future.

Please direct any further questions to Technical Support, 475
Oakmead Parkway, Sunnyvale CA 94086; (408)733-0100."
