  Re: Hazardous Battery WARNING!!!

WARNING:  Batteries may be hazardous to your computer's (and your own)
health!
 
Just a consumer-type cautionary note, of which I was reminded by the
mention of my Kaypro 4'84 clock battery in a previous message.....
 
The '84 model Kaypro 4's and 10's, with factory-installed time-of-day
clocks, utilized an uncommon style 3-volt lithium battery (Duracell
DL2/3A) with solder-type terminals, which is connected directly to the
system circuit board.  Many of these, of course, are no longer
functional (based on my personal experience with at least three
different such systems of various vintage).  And many Kaypro owners,
who do not use add-on commercial software to support the clock (such as
Plu*Perfect Systems' DateStamper), may be oblivious to the existence of
these batteries.
 
In my own case, the battery was removed years ago and placed in a desk
drawer for future reference, when I discovered that an exact
replacement was not readily available through normal consumer
electronics channels.  (Alternate types of batteries and connections
are certainly quite feasible, if not desirable.)
 
The danger is this...  Just last week, I noticed a sizzling sound
emanating from the depths of my desk, accompanied by an acrid odor and
a noticeable amount of smoke.  You guessed it:  The battery had leaked
acid, destroying quite a few nearby paper items along with its own
casing.  This was a real fire hazard, and I'm just thankful I happened
to be present at the time.
 
Of course, this warning applies to improper storage of ALL batteries,
not just the ones contained in Kaypros.  But a word to the wise!  I'd
hate to see the results if that old, neglected battery should decide to
self-destruct inside your computer.
