                         SB180 Spec Sheet


        The MICROMINT SB180 computer packs a lot of computing power in
a very small package!  The SB180, only 4" by 7 1/2", offers a Z-80
compatible CPU running at 6 MHz, 256K bytes of RAM, up to 32 K bytes of
ROM, two serial ports, a parallel port, expansion bus, and an industry
standard 765A-compatible disk controller for up to four disk drives -
any combination of 3 1/2", 5 1/4", or 8" drives.  Whether you use the
SB180 as the basis for a complete disk based computer system or use its
32K of ROM space for a battery-powered dedicated controller application
program, you will appreciate its ability to run standard 8080/8085 and
Z-80 software at up to twice the speed of a 4 MHz Z-80.

        The SB180 uses the most powerful of the new generation 8 bit
CPUs - the Hitachi HD64180.  The HD64180 is based on a microcoded
execution unit and advanced CMOS manufacturing technology.  It provides
the benefits of high performance, reduced system cost and low power
operation while maintaining complete compatibility with the large base
of standard CP/M software.  Performance of the HD64180 derives from it
high clock speed, instruction pipelining, and an integrated Memory
Management Unit (MMU) with 512K bytes memory address space.  The
instruction set is a superset of the Z80 instruction set; twelve new
instructions include hardware multiply and a SLEEP instruction for low
power operation.  System costs are reduced because many key system
functions have been included on-chip. Besides the MMU, the HD64180
boasts a two channel Direct Memory Access Controller (DMAC), wait state
generator, dynamic RAM refresh, two channel Asynchronous Serial
Communication Interface (ASCI), Clocked Serial I/O port (CSI/O), two
channel 16-bit Programmable Reload Timer (PRT), a versatile 12 source
interrupt controller, and a "dual" (68xx and 80xx families) bus
interface.

        Because the SB180 uses the Z80 instruction set, it can run CP/M
2.2, CP/M Plus, Z-System, MP/M II, TurboDOS, and Oasis operating
systems. These operating systems can be custom configured to make use
of the 256K bytes on board memory for enhanced performance.  And
popular program development tools for these operating systems - BASIC,
FORTRAN, Pascal, PL/1, C, Forth, assembler, etc. - are widely
available; thousands of proven application programs will work, too!

                          The Micromint ROM Monitor

        The ROM monitor provided with the SB180 is a complete set of
utilities and debugging aids in an 8K byte PROM which supports four I/O
"devices":

        CON: - Console RS-232 serial port
        AUX: - auxillary RS-232 serial port
        CEN: - Centronics parallel printer port
        DSK: - floppy disk storage device

 Monitor Commands include:

  A - ASCII table:  prints an ASCII code table
  B - Bank select:  selects a 64K memory bank
  C - Copy disk:  systems with 256K RAM can perform single drive copies
  D - Display memory:  displays memory in hex and ASCII
  E - Emulate terminal:  console keyboard is echoed to the auxillary RS-232
      output, and the RS-232 input is echoed on the console display

                       Z-SYSTEM DISK OPERATING SYSTEM

        The Z-System is an enhanced 8-bit operating system which is a
complete replacement for CP/M 2.2 from Digital Research.  Any of the
thousands of application programs, languages, or utilities which run
under CP/M will also run under Z-System.  Z-System is a more advanced,
more convenient operating environment than CP/M, with many utility
programs which give the user more consistent, easier access to its
features. Named directories are provided rather than disk drive
designators and user areas. Multiple commands may be entered on the
command line.  A sophisticated "search path" is implemented for
programs and files.  Input/output redirection is supported.  Password
protection for directory access is available, and user privilege levels
for commands can be provided.  Z- System has been customized to make
use of the SB180's expanded instruction set, making it very fast and
extremely efficient.
