RE:       Sanyo inverse video

     If  you are one of the proud owners of a Sanyo 8-bit machine 
(probably  ALL Sanyo's) I really don't have to tell you that  the 
documentation  for these machines leaves a little to be  desired.  
Hopefully this document will help,  maybe it is common knowledge?   
The  Sanyo  1200/1250 (maybe others?) has four possibilities  for 
video character display:
                         Standard 
                          Inverse video 
                           Underlined 
                            Overlined 

These  character  types may also be combined  for  other  effects 
(except for inverse and standard)

Here  is the description on how to use this feature in the  Sanyo 
MBC-1200 series users guide escape code section (incidentally MBC 
stands for.....ya ready ?... My Business Computer)  
     
If you have manual 9376411909401 on page R-17 you are greeted by:

ESC   t        1B.74     Attribute Set   (Inverse,   underline 
                                         Upperline)

Now come on this is as CLEAR as possible, right?

If  you happened to be blessed with manual 9376411909401A on page 
R-18 they have expanded on the description to this:

ESC t          1B.74     Attribute On/Off(only 33-line mode)
(BIOS ver. 1.4
or after)
                         D7 ........... Fixed to 0
                         D6 ........... Fixed to 0
                         D5 ........... Fixed to 0
                         D4 ........... Fixed to 0
                         D3 ........... Overline
                         D2 ........... Inverse
                         D1 ........... Underline
                         D0 ........... Fixed to 0


What could be clearer,  EH? 

Ok,  enough spouting off,  now I'll try for a translation on this
What  I find you must do is this.   Say you wanted to  print  the 
string  `I  love  my Sanyo' underlined.   You have  to  send  the 
following sequence to be printed.

          1BH,'t',2,'I love my Sanyo',1BH,'t',0      

or in BASIC it would be

PRINT CHR$(27);"t";CHR$(2);"I Love my Sanyo";CHR$(27);"t";CHR$(0)

What this does is prepares for Underline video, prints the string 
then  turns the underline feature OFF!   Otherwise the  following 
characters would also be underlined.

The  key  to  this whole escape sequence is  the  character  that 
follows  the 1Bh,'t'.   This is how it works with  the  character 
broken down into 8 bits.

          n    n    n    n    o    i    u    n
          o    o    o    o    v    n    n    o
          t    t    t    t    e    v    d    t
                              r    e    e    
          u    u    u    u    l    r    r    u    
          s    s    s    s    i    s    l    s
          e    e    e    e    l    e    i    e
          d    d    d    d    e         n    d
                              e
          |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |
          v    v    v    v    v    v    v    v

          0    0   0     0    0    0    0    0     <- Binary value

If you set the underline bit you get underline 
If you set the overline bit you get overline.
If you set both you get both.

But..
If you set JUST the inverse bit you get inverse,  underline,  and 
overline.
 
Any   bits   set  with  the  inverse  bit  set   subtracts   that 
feature  (actually  it provides you with a non inverse  under  or 
overline)

OK?  I included a short (and primative) program for you to run to 
demonstrate.

If  there are any questions or comments you can try leaving me  a 
message on my system 313-465-9615   300/1200 baud  24 hours
