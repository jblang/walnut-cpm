
               SOLVING SCREEN CLEAR PROBLEMS

   Those  of us who have ADM-3A or similar  terminals  which 
use  CTL-Z  as  the screen clear have a  problem  with  some 
software (like the Peachtree business software) which imbeds 
screen clear characters in the data files on disk.  The CTL-
Z  is  a  1A hex,  which is the same as  CP/M's  end-of-file 
character.

   In the past, the solution to this problem has been to re-
write the software to use some other character in the  file, 
and then converting it to the screen clear before printing.

   I  recently  saw a message about this on  another  system 
which  made  me say to myself "why didn't I think of  that?" 
...simply  add in the value for bit 7 as being high  instead 
of  low!   In other words,  instead of defining  the  screen 
clear in the program as CHR$(26),  make it CHR$(154).   Most 
terminals ignore the parity bit,  so this is interpreted the 
same as a CHR$(26) !

   If your terminal does not ignore the parity bit,  you can 
still  use this trick if you reassemble your  CBIOS,  adding 
ANI 7FH just ahead of the output to your console port in the 
CONOUT routine.
