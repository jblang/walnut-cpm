         This  library contains UNCR80.COM, v2.0.  This is an 8080  /
    8085 version of the UNCRunch utility, and is recommended only for
    use  on machines NOT running a Z-80 processor (it is both  larger
    and  slower than the standard UNCR.COM, v2.0, available from  the
    library  CRUNCH20.LBR). This is a "preliminary" release,  and  as
    such does not yet include a corresponding CRUNCH80 program. Mean-
    while,  this program makes will fill the gap to  make  "crunched"
    files available to all.

         Usage of this program is identical to the standard  version.
    Basically, just type UNCR80  <filename>.  For additional documen-
    tation, refer to CRUNCH20.LBR.
