                                 USQ.COM

     USQ.COM is an assembler version of the standard Unsqueeze program,
written in C.  The advantages of this version are MUCH faster execution, same
syntax for operation (including multiple files and wildcards), and much
smaller size (only 2k!).

     To use this program on files which have been compressed by SQ, simply
type:

USQ filename

     Where filename is the full name and extension of the file you wish to
decompress.

     You may also use the multiple file option, and you may also specify a
different drive for the output files.  As well, you may just type:

USQ

     This will place you into a command line driven mode, indicated by a '*'
on the screen.  All normal filename combinations will work now, but the disk
drives will be reset before any operations are preformed.  This allows you to
change disks without returning to CP/M.

     As mentioned earlier, this program will also accept wildcards.  You may
wish to decompress, for example, all .AQM and all .DQC files on drive A, and
put the destination files on drive C.  To do this, you would type:

USQ *.AQM *.DQC C:


Possible errors:

     While unsqueezing, you may encounter some errors.  The most common will
be BDOS errors of the bad sector nature.  Everyone knows how to handle these!

     Less common will be messages like "Illegal decode table size", which
usually indicates that the file in question is not a squeezed file, but
appears to be.  If a file is not a squeezed file, but is included in a
wildcard specification (like *.*!), the file will not be altered, and the
message "is not squeezed.  Ignored" will appear.

     A very uncommon error will be "Checksum error.".  This error indicates
that the file does not match the original.  It is usually caused by either an
undetected BDOS error, or possibly a file transmission error.  Try to obtain
another copy of the file, and attempt the decompress again.

Differences between the C version and this one:

     None of the "-" switches operate in this version, as I have seen no call
for them.  Directed I/O will not work, but using the command line mode, and a
public domain package like "EX 1.21" will give you the same effect for input.
Wildcards can usually solve the problem, though, since files that are not
squeezed are ignored.

Disclaimer and Warning:

     While this program has been tested, no liablity will be assumed for its
operation, or lack thereof.

     Feel free to use this for personal use, but if you wish to bundle it with
other software, or sell it itself, please contact me for more information.
