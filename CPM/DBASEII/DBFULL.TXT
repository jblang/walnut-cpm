(How to make space and close important files in dBASE II)

If you get "disk is full" message in the middle of a project,
don't panic.  Type the "list files" command and see what you can
delete.  After eliminating extra files, your program should save
properly.  If you still get the "disk is full" message, try
typing the "clear" command.  You should then be able to quit
properly.
