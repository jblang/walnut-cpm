Re:   How to contact TUG

From the last issue of TUG Lines (V1#5, Feb/Mar 85):

	TUG Lines is published bi-monthly by the Turbo User Group,
	PO Box 1510, Poulsbo, WA 98370.  Membership in TUG is for one
	year from receipt of your application.  Membership fee is $20.00.

This latest issue contained a large list of known bugs with fixes and
workarounds along with much info on using Turbo, lots of source code,
new products, etc.  Highly recommended!
