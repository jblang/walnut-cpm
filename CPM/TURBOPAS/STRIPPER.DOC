Re:   Stripper WS Util in Turbo - STRIPPER.PAS

I noticed the PC and Pascal world doesn't have (or I couldn't find) a
nice little public domain hi-bit stripping program for WS and other
nasty type files.  Grabbed a handful of PD programs, some TURBTOOL
procedures, and did a little hack.

Stripper naturally strips the 8th bit (just like good old PIP with the
Z option).  Also does a tabify routine to replace all those WS DOC
type file streams of spaces with 8-space tabs.  Also grabs isolated
CRs and makes them CR/LF combinations.

Works fairly fast (didn't do any inline assembler to keep it
transportable), simple, from the command line.  Default product is
FOOBAR.HAR, but you can force any desired file name from the cmd line.
Sorry, no MS-DOS paths (tho if someone could tell me how to do
that...) but alternate disks, of course.
