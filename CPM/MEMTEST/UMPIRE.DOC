UMPIRE  is  a comprehensive memory test program implementing  two 
test  algorithms developed at the University  of  Illinois.   The 
algorithms  were  published  in June 1978 'IEEE  TRANSACTIONS  ON 
COMPUTERS'.   The  University of Illinois test algorithms are the 
'BOOMERANG' and the 'HALF SLOW' test routines.  Also included are 
two test routines I devised.

The  test will automatically size the TPA and test all of  memory 
up the start of BDOS.   There are only three control codes.  A ^K 
will cause the test to restart, a ^C will cause a jump to address 
zero (i.e. warm boot), and a ^S will cause the program to stop or 
start.  The ^S function is particularlly useful in the 'SCRAMBLE' 
and 'SPIRAL' routine to stop to test causing refresh verification 
on dynamic memories.   Another ^S will cause the test to start up 
again.  Both the 'SCRAMBLE' and 'SPIRAL' test routines use random 
data  so  this  is  a fair test of a  memory  array  for  pattern 
sensitivity.
