                +++YOU MUST HAVE SENDOUT.COM+++

HERE'S THE OLD PROBLEM:
      You are  on your favorite  RCPM  systems and see five or six
files to transfer  to your  system, or  perhaps  you  want to send
a  group  of  programs over there  To reduce  your phone time, you
could prepare a submit file which uses  SENDOUT.COM  and MODEM.COM
to modem over the files automatically. Writing a SUBMIT file takes
a while, and would be VERY  impolite  to tie up the RCPM while you
hack away, editing the file. SYSOPs don't like that kind of thing!
      Well,if you make a SHORT list of the programs you want, then
run XFER.BAS, it will prompt you for  file names & other  commands
for both your's and the Remote system, creating the file  XFER.SUB
containing  all  the  commands  necessary  for the transfer. These
commands would include change logged disks, and user areas.
      Using this utility, you could be back in minutes,transfering
programs with a minimum of delay.
      One word of caution: Unless  you have the permission  of the
SYSOP, please do not transfer a large batch of files, tying up the
phone for hours on end.  I can think  of no better way to wear out
a welcome! Most systems have one hour limits, so plan accordingly.

updated commands as of 12/16/81:
        If you are Sending files, you will be  asked if the remote
accepts the 'C' XMODEM option for CRC checking.
        Very few, if any, RCPM  systems will  accept a  'COM' file
A warning message will be issued if you try sending COM files. You
may  eliminate this  feature in the source code to send COM files.

                   How to run XFER.BAS:
      Upon running XFER,  you will be asked if you wish to send or
receive, and at what baud  rate.  The  next prompt asks you if you
would like to freeze the options.  Answer  Y (yes) if you want all
transfers to  use the same  modem  options  (O,Q,C, ect.)  and all
files  transfered  to or  from the same disk. The next two prompts
are  self-explanitory.  Choosing  to freeze the options will cause
the  program to  issue  only  the next  two commands listed below.
Choosing  not  to  freeze  the  options  will give  you all of the
following prompts:

                    COMMANDS TO THE REMOTE >

Answer with either a command to the remote such as moving to a new
disk or user area, or a carriage return (CR) for no command.

                           FILENAME >

Use  the standard  CP/M format of  FN.FT  as usual.  If  you  need
another  command  to the  remote, such as when changing both drive
and user areas, enter '$$$'  at  the  FILENAME prompt.  This  will
cause the  COMMANDS line to reappear, and you may enter additional
command(s).  If you want  a command to your system, type 'XXX' for
the filename.  Use this comand to to do a  DIR or a MODEM D at the
end of the transfer. Be sure to send the BYE command to the remote
before logging off!  A CR will terminate the program.

                          MODEM OPTIONS >

Enter any options IN ADDITION TO the mandatory R or S, such as the
'O' or 'Q' options DO NOT enter an R or S at this prompt!

                 YOUR DISK TO SEND/RECEIVE FROM/TO >

This is  your disk,  not  the  remote's! If  you  wish  to write or
send from the default disk  of  your system, a carriage return (CR)
will do.  You will now return to the top command.  YOU MUST INCLUDE
A QUOTE!  Type 'B:' to send to or recieve from your drive B.

To end,  hit a CR for both the  COMMAND and the FILENAME.   Remember
to  return to the  remote and log off with 'BYE' if it is not a part
of the submit file!
     Run Xfer a number of time for practice before trying it on line.
Look at the XFER.SUB file to see how the process works.
     Happy computing!

+++ Notes on compiling XFER.BAS:
        You will see the following line during compilation, ignor it.

0017  0007      300 CLEAR 1000
                    ^ SI

        It will  not cause  an error either in assembly or running.
        Using BASCOM 3.21, XFER.COM is 16K.  Editing out all of the
REM statements doesn't seem to cut down the size or the run time.
                                 END
