The file UNPRO.COM was created as an experiment and has been proven to
reliably UNPROTECT files saved under MBASIC 5.21's ,P option. Care should
be taken to not run UNPRO on the only copy of a file, i.e. make a backup
of the protected file first!

Usage:

Simply enter UNPRO, followed by the full file name. The resulting output
file will be written back to the input file. In rare instances of disk
write or close errors, the file can be considered trashed.

Usage example:

A>unpro testme.bas
A>unpro b:xyzzy.bas
A>unpro c:test.fle	<--- note that the file MUST be MBASIC ,P format!


Please, please... use this program to unprotect your own programs for which
you have ruined or otherwise lost the master copies. Use the program at your
own FULL RESPONSIBILITY if what you intend to do is against any laws.
