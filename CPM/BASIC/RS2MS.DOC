             RS2MS.DOC - Documentation for RS2MS.BAS

RS2MS.BAS (originally named MYRS2MB) Version 1.0 was written by Ed Mahoney
28 May 1983.  This program will convert a Radio Shack Model I or Model 3
BASIC (or Disk BASIC) program to a Microsoft BASIC 5.1 program.

REQUIREMENTS:

1) Your computer that will be running the Microsoft program
must be able to 'print at' specific locations on your screen.

2) The Radio Shack program that is to be converted, must exist
on disk and be stored in ASCII format.
   a) This program must not have line numbers 1 or 2 (the conversion
      process will place statements in these positions)
   b) The statements in the Radio Shack program must not be extremely
      long, say greater than 220 characters long. (The program will
      expand each line.)
   c) The Radio Shack Program should not have the following statements:
      PEEK  POKE  SET(x,y)  RESET(x,y)  POINT(x,y).  (These statements
      are machine dependent).  If these 5 statements are present, they
      will be passed on to the MBASIC with a REM statement appended to
      the end that warns you that you will have to do some additional
      conversion (good luck!).

3) FINAL WARNING: This is only version 1.0. This utility has not been
extensivly tested.

WHAT IT DOES:

   1) converts the RND function to MBASIC standards
   2) converts Radio Shack's CLS statement to a print code
   3) converts Radio Shack's PRINT @ ##, to a printable code
   4) 'pads' all statements with spaces which MBASIC requires (and Radio
      Shack does not).
   5) Identifies statements that are machine dependent (ex. PEEK or SET
      with a warning at the end of the statement and provides a table of
      the bad statements at the end of execution.

INSTALLATION:

The conversion process will make certain Radio Shack statements
into printable 'escape codes'. You must know the two escape code
sequences for your computer (or terminal):
   1) clear the screen and home the cursor
   2) print at a screen location (Row,Column)
