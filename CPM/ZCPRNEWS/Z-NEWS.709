Of Significance.  Sure, we blow our own horn, but if you are looking for qual-
ity in an operating system, we have it.  If you haven't yet ordered ZCPR v3.3 
with its tutorial-style 65-page User's Guide now is the time to do it, to up-
date your Z-System or CP/M machine.  Item 1 on our Price List is $49.00 and 
represents a significant advance over previous versions.
     ZCPR 3.3 User's Guide may be ordered alone and is priced $14.95, Item 87 
on Price List.  For those who have already purchased v3.0 core package from 
us, act-now complete update package price is only $25.00 for v3.3 core, guide, 
plus enhanced RCP, FCP, and utilities that are impressive (see Z-User's Corner 
below).  Guide tells how to install new command processor manually using 
several different techniques, and also how to install it into Z-COM.  Written 
by Jay Sage, author of v3.3 (Z-News 705-1), lots of insight into command 
processor design is contained in laser-typeset manual.  With ZCPR3: The Manual 
by Richard Conn, which came with the original core package, and with Z-System 
User's Guide by Richard Jacobson and Bruce Morgen, you have complete document-
ation to learn all about the ZCPR command processor replacement to the CP/M 
CCP module, and more.

     Fortnighter newspaper, Computer Currents, gets wider distribution, beyond 
San Francisco Bay Area (Z-News 608-1).  Now it's distributed in Los Angeles 
area.  Also, this month, June, Boston area gets it, soon to be followed by New 
York City and Washington D.C.  Other areas are to be added in 1988.  Newspaper 
covers world of desktop computing, including publishing.  In the above cities, 
it's passed out free, usually through popular computer stores.  But you can 
subscribe by calling 415/547-6800.  Publisher, Stan Politi, has turned his 
dream into a reality by going national.  Stan, congratulations!  And pass 
along our greetings and thanks to columnist Ted Silveira for doing such a good 
job with "CP/M Connection."
     Interested in having WordStar v4.0 support ZCPR3 and ZRDOS?  Well, we 
will get it--it's possible--if enough people want a ZCPR, Z-System version of 
WordStar (understand anything new as upgraded Newword).  All we need to do is 
let Product Manager, Lee Lensky, know your desires.  Write down your thoughts-
-no phone calls--and send them to Mr. Lensky at MicroPro International, 33 San 
Pablo Ave., San Rafael, CA 94903, or leave a message via MCI mail to LLENSKY.

From The Mail Box.   Rick Charnes, San Francisco, CA, (TLIB and RCOM author, 
Z-News 706-2) teaches Z-System at Chabot Science Center & Observatory, 4917 
Mountain Blvd., Oakland, CA.  Course starts in July, classes held every Thurs-
day, and goes for ten weeks.  If interested, call Chabot College at 415/531-
4560.  Leave your name, address, phone number; then, literature will be sent 
to you.  (Remember Rick?  He writes super column, called "Forever Z," in 
Morrow Owners' Review.  For more information call 415/644-2638, or write MOR, 
P.O. Box 5487, Berkeley, CA 94705.)
     From Glenn Brooke, Evanston, IL, "I came across this passage and 
immediately thought of you and the terrific Z-System and community: 
'Superficiality is the curse of our age.  The doctrine of instant satisfaction 
is a primary spiritual problem.  The desperate need today in not for a greater 
number of intelligent people, nor gifted people, but for deep people.'--
Richard L. Foster, Celebration of Discipline."  Yes, we think Foster is of our 
cloth.  Now, we look for a few more special people..."I find our tendency to 
superficiality appalling, and see it permeating our culture--in television, 
entertainment, political leadership, and work ethic.  The Z community is a 
refreshing fan on a very hot, humid day.  Please accept my thanks...for your 
wonderful efforts."  That we do, and thanks Glenn for sharing with us.

Z-User's Corner.   Version 3.3 of ZCPR and its accompanying upgraded utilities 
further improve productivity through increased task-automation possibilities.  
(If you get your upgrades by Z-Node downloading, you likely need to acquire 
from us the User's Guide, Item 87.)
     Let's look at the new SHOW, Version 1.1, and what it can show you about 
your system.  In another newsletter we will discuss what you can do with the 
greatly expanded FCP features.

Compare above menu to your present SHOW main menu.  Notice guide header for 
memory utility easing data location.  SHOW now tells more of how your system 
is set-up, is better organized; notice new CPR 5, 6, and 7 options.
     Many resident commands available make it difficult to remember them all.  
So new RCP has expanded H command that shows all available FCP, CPR, and RCP 
commands.  For us, "H<cr>" entered at command line, even Z command line of 
VFILER, displays:

Hardware Beat.   High Tech Research ULTRABOARD (Z-News 708-1) comes along as 
scheduled.  Should be shipping before summer's end.  We hear for an external 
monitor driver, the Hitachi HD63484 graphics chip and Micromint X-Bus is to be 
used.  Very impressive!  Bill Nesting and his development team (call them at 
800/446-3220, in California call 800/446-3223, RAS 916/243-9358) cause lots of 
PC-compatible folks to sit-up and take note.  Here is the Z280 add-in board to 
'84 Kaypros that outguns IBM ATs.
     Wyse Technology, the San Jose ASCII/ANSI/Graphics terminal maker, went 
public with ownership October 1984 and stock sold for $7.00 a share.  Today, 
June 1987, company's stock sells for over $30.00 a share, over 300% rise.  
Bernard Tse, bravo!

Software Beat.  ZAS-ZLINK advances continue...Al Hawley, Z-Node #2 Sysop and 
Z-Team member, and support-team rapidly enhance our assembler-linker duo.  
Next release should be near end of summer, a release to make us all proud.  
Temporarily, Al has taken over the responsibility of design, future enhance-
ment, coding, and maintenance of assembler and linker.  His qualifications, 
experience, early successes justify our enthusiasm.  Al is the author of 
REVAS, Item 23 on our Price List, the disassembler that set the standard.
   
           Good wine quickly spoils in the presence of bad company.

In Other Words.  We are "voice of the voiceless."  Few can hear us speak; they 
have not ears for our words, our works.  Nonetheless, we produce a newsletter 
written to be read (and read many times over), one that's fun to read; we say 
in few words what we have to say.  Our style has changed as we have changed 
over the years.  We are serious, but not too serious; we laugh at ourselves 
and laugh at you.  Power of the press comes to us finally, no longer just in 
the hands of big institutions and their supporters.  In our faceless society, 
we can finally be innovative in the documents we individually create and put 
our styles to compete in the professional arena.  Individualism is back--let's 
make the most of it!
==============================================================================
Of Angels and Eagles.  Ask any group of serious wine drinkers their favorite 
red wine and you are likely to get Cabernet Sauvignon as the primary response.
That comes with little surprise since Cabernet wines are likely the best red 
wines made today--anywhere in the world.  But there are lovers of Pinot Noir 
who insist the angular hardness of Cabernet is no match for the silky richness 
of the better Pinots from California.  Some may tell you--with tongues deeply 
pressed into cheeks--Cabernet fans actually suffer from Pinot envy.  Lots of 
choice Cabernets and Pinots sit on store shelves ready for picking; but good, 
really good, red Zinfandels are scarce.
     Some time ago, Zinfandel grapes were declared native to California, but 
with a certain uncertainty.  They may have come originally from Europe, 
perhaps Italy.  Today, white "Zin" is very popular but it has been produced 
for only the last three or four years.  Red has been around much longer as a 
vintage premium wine, a wine with tantalizing complexity, spicy, mellow, berry 
aroma, a certain uncomparable richness of taste.  Red Zins mature much the 
same as Cabernets.  And for the connoisseur interested in value and a change 
of pace, Zinfandels provide just that, and are so hard to beat as pure wine 
adventure.  The point?  There are many levels of being--we each see what we 
have eyes to see.
     Now back to training our pair of okapis.  But first, we share a sip or 
two of warm red Zinfandel with Magdalena.  See you down the lines...
