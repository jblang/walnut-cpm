==============================================================================
Of Significance.  Event of the season, early summer sees first board released 
using Zilog Z280 chip (Z-News 705-4, 707-4).  High Tech Research of Redding, 
CA, offers ULTRABOARD as an add-in to their K20 hard disk CP/M machine, and 
'84 Kaypros.  Priced at $495, board runs at 12MHz and is said to be up[ to 10 
times faster than a 4MHz Kaypro.  Knowing the Z280 cache data and instruction 
capability, we at Echelon believe it will.  Board has one megabyte of RAM--
expandable to 16--as RAMdisk and print buffer.  And new driver is said to re-
write screens 25 times faster than standard Kaypros.  And driver increases 
screen resolution to 640 by 400 pixels.  With an UltraBoard add-in, the K20 
longs for our upgraded Z-System (ZOS), just as present CP/M systems crave 
present Z-System.  Call or write High Tech Research for more information, 
address and telephone numbers in Hardware Beat below.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
From Our Mail Box.   "I want to thank Echelon for opening the doors to a new 
world of eight-bit computing...your products and documentation have helped me 
make the leap into assembly language programming...breathed new life into my 
modified, but ageing, Kaypro II...low-level programming has given me insight 
to greater computer fundamentals..." from Jim Thompson, New Britain, CT.  
Thanks for the praise, Jim, and glad to hear you think programming with 
Assembler is worth initial effort to learn it.  Also, thanks for the software 
order.
     "...always eager to get Z-News for both technical and human stuff," 
writes Dan Kelly from Coos Bay, OR 97420.  Dan, we are just as eager to 
produce both.
     Some may think we care not, but...if you are a minister in a church, or 
simply an interested Christian, and use CP/M computers for your work, we 
suggest a subscription to Clergy KUG.  Six issues per year for $12.00.  
Editor, Elmer F. Little, Jr., does a super job of blending religion and 
technology, passing on many tips useful in getting your job done, sowing and 
cultivating the many fields for harvest.  Write Editor, Clergy KUG, 3868 
Centorbi Court, Florissant, MO 63034, to place your order.

   By the way, for material to send our mailbox, think of the things you 
   would like to see in the new Z-System (ZOS), beyond features of ZCPR 
   v3.3 and ZRDOS v1.7.  Jay, Ken, Malcom, and Bridger are looking for 
   your ideas--we have ours but yours are just as important.  Therefore, 
   we need to be informed about yours before they can be merged with 
   ours.  So, send in your wish list.  We are listening...

     David Johnson, Campbell, CA, writes to correct our use of mHz, instead of 
MHz, to indicate megaHertz, a measurement unit of frequency.  We stand 
corrected.  David also tells of other things that occasionally puts him ill at 
ease: incorrect word hyphenation at line ends and reverse negatives in the 
grammar world, and robots, taxation, planning for near- versus long-term 
profits, production efficiency, etc., in the truly it's not a perfect business 
world.
     "I highly enjoy Z-News and will continue to subscribe...wish more 
software supported ANSI terminals...sending you my master of ZAS and ZLINK 
v2.4 so you can upgrade me to 2.6..." from Allen McDonald, Washington D.C..  
Allen, enjoy the free upgrade as a symbol of our dedication to making ZAS-
ZLINK the best assembler-linker combination available.  ANSI terminals may be 
going the way of dinosaurs--ASCII Wyse outsells DEC ANSI and bit-mapped 
screens become so popular ANSI appears in the lurch.

Z-Node Activity.   Just a reminder...as Z-News 707-1 stated, Z-Node Central 
has moved and has a new telephone number: 415/948-6656.  Please use this 
number instead of the old one.  We should provide better service from Los 
Altos location.  If using PC-Pursuit, it's a San Jose (408) connection, not 
San Francisco (415).  Thanks.

Software Update Service Report.   SUS #11 is filled...shipping in June.  One 
new file, TX.LBR added since we last showed directory.  TX, by Harris 
Landsberg, Brooklyn, NY, is just about the best of the text file listers, 
straight, squeezed, or crunched, and from in libraries.  Output can be 
redirected to a file or to printer, as desired.  Has other neat command-line 
options, but doesn't recognize user areas or named directories and has no 
built-in help.  Let's get Harris to make program a full Z-System utility (his 
phone number is in LBR file).  Of course, you could be using JetFind and get 
all the above plus string searching from multiple files (Z-News 701-1, Item 66 
now $49.95, as stated in 705-3, plus shipping and handling).

Z-User's Corner.  In your work, if you find yourself constantly leaving your 
wordprocessor and then re-entering another text file to get lines for the 
first, you need Backgrounder II.  BGii permits you to hold in memory (a disk 
buffer) a place in one program, go to another, return to the first and be in 
exactly your original place.  Transfer pieces of text of one file to another 
without leaving either program.  At any time within a program you have access 
to operating system commands, like DIR, ERA, etc.  You do all these things 
while you are automatically, sequentially, several files in the background.  
If these features sound good to you, order BGii from us.  It's Item 10 on EI 
Price List and is offered for $75 plus usual shipping and handling charges.  
We only recommend BGii to those who have hard disk, RAMdisk of over 128k-
bytes, or both.  More details in Z-News 704-1, and in demonstration library on 
Z-Nodes everywhere.  Get file BGIIDEM3.LBR.

   More power to those using desktop publishing.  The mainline media (the 
   press) goes where the money is.  When you look at IBM's recent 
   offerings and the coverage given them--too much over nothing--you know 
   we are not receiving information we need to set us free.  Now, let's 
   get back to the business of being innovative and creative--the heck 
   with IBM and the media.  More power to those using desktop publishing.

     A once-over the elements of high resolution printing, laser-beam 
(xerographic process) and digital phototypesetters (optical-chemical), and why 
the ASCII terminal is so efficient compared to a bit-map terminal.  But first, 
a little background.  ASCII terminals have built into their memories the 
character sets they can display, and can be accessed using one byte per 
character.  The host computers using them do not have much to do to have 
requested characters displayed.  A bit-mapped terminal or a laser printer, on 
the other hand, requires many bytes to display or print one character, if that 
character is not already stored in local machine memory.  A 300-dot per inch 
resolution laser requires 90,000 bits per square inch (300 X 300) to fully 
cover that area with dots, characters, or other graphics.  Our dream laser, 
the one with 720 dots per inch capability, requires 518,400 bits per square 
inch.  Assuming 8 bits to the byte, an 8.5" by 1" printed-page of 8" by 10.5" 
requires 945k-bytes for definition with present day laser printers, or 5.4 
megabytes if our dream machine is used.  Think what that means if you have to 
transfer the data from computer host to printer, page by page.  Wow!  Now we 
know why printers are using Centronics parallel instead of 9600-baud serial 
interfaces.  Now we know energy being expended by those people in the bit-map 
image field to reduce page printing delays--lots!  Digital phototypesetters 
use over 1200 dots per inch to get their jobs done.  Wonder no longer why they 
take up to 10 minutes to process one page.  (We noticed using B/Printer to 
save files coming from Newword or WordStar justified text, a three-to-one 
expansion of file size occurs--and that with straight ASCII characters, no 
graphics.  All the extra code comes from commands sent to printer to 
microspace-justify lines and auto-print headers and footers, and the like.)  
We pay a price to produce documents beyond dot-matrix and daisy-wheel overall 
quality...so be it.
     There was a time when, for very personal notes, only hand-written would 
do, then in business typewritten became appropriate.  Now a near-letter-
quality dot-matrix seems so impersonal as to be considered rude.  Daisy-wheels 
these days are being replaced by lasers around offices (HP HAS sold over 
250,000 of them.)  Who thinks of essence these days?  Form over substance, 
substance over form!

ought, that's the on-slaught of wisdom.

Hardware Beat.   Something to rave about: K20 and Handyman are fully 
compatible with ZCPR3 and Z-System.  High Tech Research, 1135 Pine Street, 
Suite #107, Redding, CA 96001, 800/446-3220 (inside Calif. 800/446-3223), RAS 
915/243-9358, offers super Z80 computer based on Kaypro-10 but with fast 20 
megabyte Seagate 225 hard disk and 96-tpi floppy for backup, TurboROM that 
adds additional speed.  Machine offers advantages of integrated desktop 
calculator, calendar, note pad that transfers text to and from open WordStar 
files, voice phone dialing from library file of telephone numbers, and 
concurrent file management from within an application program.  Those into 
speed and text generation and control should look into the K20.  Contact Bill 
Nesting at High Tech for more information.  (Columnist, Ted Silveira, Santa 
Cruz, CA, has thorough review of K20's features in Volume 4, Number 22 Issue 
of Computer Currents newspaper, Z-News 608-1.)

   "The Art of Typography provides crucial services and render unlimited 
   assistance to society.  It informs the citizen, advances the progress 
   of science and art, nurtures and cultivated the intellect, and elevates 
   the soul: its duty is to be the communicator and interpreter of wisdom 
   and truth.  It is the depictor of the mind.  Therefore it is truly the 
   art of all arts and the science of all sciences."--Pierre Simon 
   Fournier, 17th Century French Typographer.

     Reliable sources say National's 32532 chip is being designed into Canon's 
next-generation laser printer, the one to be used by Hewlett-Packard and 
Apple, but not likely by IBM.  It's this engine that is to upstage Ricoh's 
present 6-page-per-minute engine used by Epson and Okidata, and used by IBM, 
their version shipping late summer, with its PS/2 computers.  This engine, not 
the one in HP's present Series II printers, will give real publishing power to 
the rest of us.  For printers using Postscript (HP, IBM, and Apple) and DDL 
(HP, as a compatible language to PCL, their language for LaserJet series) page 
description languages (Z-News 607-5), a chip of National's 32532 throughput--
one that's significantly higher than Motorola's 68020--is dearly needed to 
process large amounts of bit-map data in a reasonable time, to not slow 
printing down.  What's the sense having 6- and 8-ppm printers when solving the 
algorithms takes nearly a minute per page, as is presently the case in so many 
cases with Apple's Laserwriter.
     Ink hardly dry covering deals for Ricoh's 6-ppm laser printer by IBM, 
Okidata, and Seiko Epson when C. Itoh, Torrance, CA, a Japanese trading 
company, announces Jet-Setter, a 5-ppm Konica-engined machine, for $1795, 
retail.  Printer has standard 300 by 300 dot resolution, 512k-bytes of memory, 
3 internal fonts, and emulates the HP LaserJet Plus.  Options include a 1.5 
megabyte memory expansion board, Diablo 630 and Epson FX-86 emulations, and 11 
font cartridges.  Dealers get up to 40% discount--$800 lasers of Z-News 705-3 
are near our grasp!
     Digital Equipment (DEC) new terminal line, VT330/340, near-ready for 
delivery, replaces present VT220, with both monochrome text-only and color 
text/graphics modes.  Such machines cause Wyse and TeleVideo (TVI) to rethink 
their strategies in the ASCII market.  Since Wyse is the present value, 
volume, and quality leader, we continue to pull for them to remain so, to keep 
DEC and TVI on their toes.  We hope Wyse comes out with an IBM 3270 compatible 
terminal, just to see what happens.  New WY-99GT ANSI/ASCII graphics terminal, 
priced at $649, works with Z-System TCAP, IBM PS/2 Model 30, Lotus 1-2-3, 
AutoCAD, and Ventura Publisher, priced at $649, should show world what Wyse 
people are made of, what is up their sleeves--they are innovative leaders, 
period.  Their words, their attitude, their actions create success.  A little 
put aside each week will permit WY-99GT to be our next desktop computer 
terminal.
     Japanese designers have difficulty keeping up with features of these hard 
drives.  Conner Peripherals has been shipping their 40-megabyte (formatted) 
3.5" hard disk drive (CP340) with SCSI interface.  Average access time is a 
mere 29 milliseconds.  That is one drive our Ampro Bookshelf computer could 
use.  Conner is about to ship a 100-megabyte (formatted) 3.5" with 25 msec 
access (CP3100).  Cost?  About $10.00 a megabyte!  For more information, 
contact Scott Holt at 2221 Old Oakland Road, San Jose, CA 95131, 408/433-3340.

Software Beat.  Digital Research, Inc., creators of CP/M, may have finally 
found their place-in-the-sun with new president, Richard Williams.  He pushes 
desktop publishing with economical package called GEM Desktop Publisher, 
handles two typefaces and three styles with sizes from 7 to 72 points, priced 
at $395.00, running on IBM PC-compatible computers.  Group that developed 
Ventura Publisher and marketed by Xerox are all ex-DRI employees.  These are 
the people that formed their own company when, in 1985, DRI cancelled internal 
development of such software packages.  Under Williams, Gary Kildall, DRI 
founder and chairman, is taking a hands-off attitude.  We wish DRI good 
fortune.
     Z-Team member, Ken Taschner, updates SYSLIB, Z3LIB, and VLIB.  Routines 
optimized, use Zilog mnemonics and opcodes--complete re-write.  Reductions in 
code size (2 to 10%), improvements in speed (up to 23%) result.  All Z 
utilities using the libraries benefit; in alpha test now, should be ready for 
shipment at summer's end or early fall.

In Other Words.   Learning: The Next Frontier--tied to risk management and 
life-styles...partnerships necessary as jobs get too big to be handled by one 
individual.  Time and effort combine to make our contribution seem trivial, 
but nothing could be further from reality.  A chain is no stronger than its 
weakest link.  So also our contributions to the whole.  Learning manifest 
itself by our ability to invent new strategies to deal with old situations.  
That we dearly need now!
     On a serial production line, each previous step is performed before the 
next is attempted.  If a step is not done correctly the next step may not be 
able to be performed at all.  We each depend on others, we are not islands.  
The whole is made up of parts.  We are of one planet called Earth!

                                                     What is our value-system?
                                   Big house, cars, boats, money =/ Happiness. 
                        These days, we don't live anymore--we have lifestyles.
     If we don't love what we do on a day-to-day basis, there is no happiness.
==============================================================================
Of Angels and Eagles.   After you have heard two different eyewitness accounts 
of the same automobile accident, you begin to wonder about the validity of 
history.  How do we know, for sure, what ever happened anywhere?  History!  
Bah!  Humbug!
     We ask a new hand be dealt us, one with different cards than destiny 
appears to have given us.  Pray we not be judged for our weaknesses, but for 
our loves.  Love, not an art form to us but our lives.
     It's deep into evening, as we finish up learning differences between 
mandolin and lute, so off to have a moonlight cocktail.  Hope Magdalena likes 
potion we have blended...
     Time to close our eyes, look at the stars--be gentled by their touch.  
See you down the lines...
