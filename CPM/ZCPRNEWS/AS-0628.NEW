NZ-COM has been released and shipping since June 20.  We want  to 
thank  so many of you who placed orders in advance.  Your  orders 
have been mailed to you and we are now shipping new orders within 
24 hours of receipt.  Thanks again.

We are not able to accept Visa or MasterCard payments.  Orders in 
hand have been shipped in any case with a request for payment  by 
check.   You trusted us enough to give us your card  number.   We 
trust you enough to ship product and expect your check by return.  

For new orders, please include your check or money order.  Please 
bear with us until we get the bank straightened out.  

A  new Catalog is in the making.  There will be a  few  deletions 
and  many  additions to our product list.  We will mail  the  new 
catalog  to everyone we know and up-load it to every  Z-Node  and 
BBS we can find.  Give us about a week.

Ron  Bardarson,  SYSOP  of Z-Node  Central  (408/432-0821),  will 
maintain  a special NZCOM: directory area.  NZCOM:  will  contain 
source  code  for the various NZ-COM system segments as  well  as 
other  files of specific interest to and from NZ-COM  and  Z3PLUS 
users.  

There  will be a newsletter.  "Z-Letter."  Z-Letter will  solicit 
articles  from Z-System users on topics of interest  to  Z-System 
users.  We invite your contribution to "Z-Letter" as articles  or 
'Letters to the "Letter".'  

From  time  to  time  I will put up  short  messages  of  general 
interest as text files named AS-mmdd.NEW.  These messages  should 
not be confused with "Z-Letter."
