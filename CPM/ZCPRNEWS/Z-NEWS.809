EI                             Z-NEWS 809                        14 March 1988
==============================================================================
Standards.   We have spoken of user interface consistency being  important  to 
reduce  harshness and promote tool transparency.  Many have asked what is  our 
standard.  Not suprisingly, Echelon promotes, with varing degrees of  success, 
ZS  (Z-System) log-on banner and built-in "//" help system as aspects,  VFILER 
and VMENU general appearances are others, of our standards.  

<utility name>, Version x.n   [brief description of utility's function]
Syntax:
  <example command line> <[/][options]>
Options:
  <list of option letters and their function>

By convention, text between brackets, "[" and "]", is optional.
     Here are some existing examples, all acceptable, but none exactly follow-
ing the standard except for PATH:

ERASE  Version 5.1 (loaded at 8000h)
Syntax:
  ERASE dir:filename.typ,dir:fn.ft,... [/]o...
Options:
   I -- Inspect Mode (Give user approval option)
   R -- Erase R/O Files without prompting user
   S -- Include SYS Files

SHCTRL Version 1.0
SHCTRL - Control Shell Stack
Syntax:
  SHCTRL C or SHCTRL CLR - Clear Shell Stack
  SHCTRL D or SHCTRL DIS - Display Shell Stack
  SHCTRL P or SHCTRL POP - Pop Shell Stack

DIR, Version 1.4
 Syntax:  DIR dir:afn o
 Options: A=All, S=Sys, H=Horiz, V=Vert, P=Print, T=File Type/Name Sort

PATH, Version 3.1
Syntax:
  PATH       <-- Display Path
  PATH expr  <-- Set Path

ERASE,  here a Type 3 utility loaded at and running from address 8000h,  comes 
close to meeting standard.  It needs the comma following its name and separat-
ing  word  Version (fully spelled out; in print we usually use  "<nane>  vx.n" 
instead  of  full  word) but correctly has multi-space indent  to  Syntax  and 
Options.   Additionally, there is little or no need to have two hyphens for  a 
dash,  one  would do, spacing option letter and its  description.   PATH  uses 
arrows  to explain command-line syntax variations.  In most cases  only  first 
line of "//" help shown above is used as a program log-on banner.
     Another  kind of consistency to promote, watch for during coding  is  how 
the  tool displays its collected data.  And, what do several tools  look  like 
when  displayed one after another as in a multiple command alias at cold  boot 
(hardware  reset)  time?  Below, two displays show some seen from one  of  our 
STARTUP aliases used during boot.

PATH, Version 3.1
 Symbolic Form: A15: --> A0: --> A15:
 DU Form:       A15: --> A0: --> A15:
 DIR Form:      ROOT: --> BASE: --> ROOT:
PUBLIC, Version 1.0
 Public User Drive(s):  A: 
 Public User Area(s):   6: 
 DIR Form: Drive A:    PRIVATE:

The user sees a certain grace, at least that is the way we see it, in how  the 
single-space  indents are handled at the left margins...very pleasing  to  our 
stressed-out eyes.
     We  present these standards to those who modify and enhance our  Z-System 
utilities,  both Z-Team members and the community at large.  Please study  the 
standards and do your best to adhere to them.  You will have the whole  commu-
nity thanking you.  We understand there are cases in which the standards don't 
really apply, like for those programs not using the "//" built-in help techni-
que.  VMENU and ZFILER are good examples, because of their unusually broad set 
of functions.  Thanks for hearing us out...
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Software  Update  Service.  "Using EASE, you can step  backward  through  your 
commands  or  search  for a specific command, no matter how long  ago  it  was 
typed.   You  can then edit it and re-execute it."  Error  and  Shell  Editor, 
needs ZCPR v3.3 but functions as full-screen editing error and command history 
shell,  replaces Z33VERR (or any other error handler) and HSH or  VCED.   (LBR 
includes Z33LIB in case you wish to re-assemble and link EASE.)  Error handler 
works  from  ZFILER internal command line but command history shell  does  not 
(hint to Paul and Jay).  Always load EASE before loading other shells on  your 
system.   EASE  E<cr> installs only error handler; EASE  S<cr>,  only  command 
history  shell; and, EASE<cr>, both.  EASE, the best we have seen in a  combi-
national tool--full editing of command lines and any errors that have resulted 
plus  command  recall from "way-back."  Our thanks to Paul Pomerleau  and  Jay 
Sage for such a Z-System masterpiece.

                     DIRectory, Version 1.4  01/22/86

     LAP (Loader and Path), written by Bob Andersson, Gloucester, England,  is 
a  neat  way  to configure your system after a cold  boot.   Paul  Pomerleau's 
Library Loader, LLDR, quickly loads group of system segments from a  library--
really  works  fast in a STARTUP alias.  Our cup runs over, how do  we  choose 
between using LAP and LLDR?
     LX18  is  Howard Goldstein and Bruce Morgen's latest  handiwork  updating 
Rick  Conn's  Library eXecute to full Z33 compatibility.   MCOPY47B,  by  very 
active  Bruce  Morgen  of Z-Sig and NAOG, brings utility  into  modern  world.
Bruce, next PRINT III v2.0?
     Michal Carson fixes a few little bugs in super VLU102 library  management 
utility.   Michal  is upgrading VLU with delete and krunch  functions,  likely 
ready in early Spring.
     John  T. Brown has been super busy creating polished  ZFILER  user-macros 
and  WordStar  v4.0 printer driver utilities, ZFILRCMD.LBR  and  WS4PRNDV.LBR.
Here  we have multiple-command aliases and lines carried to upper echelons  of 
usefulness, automation.  Much energy went into designing and documenting these 
36 or so routines.  Give a look--we can all learn something.
     Z33TRC11.LBR   contains   ZSDOS-(co)developer  (Z-News   807-1)   Cameron 
Cotrill's  RCP extension loading under the CCP instead of in buffer  space  in 
high  BIOS memory.  Called Transient RCP, works much like Backgrounder ii  and 
CP/M v3.0 RSX programs.
     Z3LOC v1.5 contains Joe Wright's handiwork, expands the information shown 
by this Z3 system location utility.  (Z3LOC complements SHOW v1.2 for  telling 
about OS characteristics.)  See Z-User's Corner below for what Z3LOC can do.
     We  applaud  quality of these utilities and thank each of  you  for  your 
contribution at making them great.  Keep up the good work!

Z-Node  Doings.   Lots of call-ins, message exchanges, up  and  downloads.   A 
thought...do you use VLU<cr> to see inside libraries to view members?  At 2400 
bps  action  is good (even for we who use 38,400 baud terminals on  a  regular 
basis),  but  a little too slow at 1200, and not at all useful  or  acceptable 
(especially  to sysops) at 300 baud.  How times change!  Many of  us  remember 
(you  around, Irv Hoff?) using hardcopy 45-baud Teletype and thought that  was 
fast information transfer.
     James  DeMauro, Plainview, NY 1803, Pro-Gram RAS, takes over Z-Node  #59, 
516/932-7674, ready to install ham radio packet capability.
     Welcome  to  Robert  Cooper,  Sysop for  new  Z-Node  #81,  805/942-5669, 
Lancaster,  CA 93535, Coop's RAS, with H89/90 and CDR SuperRam.  Robert,  like 
James, is readying for packet radio.
     Up-to-date  Z-Node roster (along with Good-Neighbor Helper roster) is  to 
be published on 4 April, both hardcopy and uploaded to Z-Nodes.

From  The   Mail Box.  Gerald McMullon, Cambridge, England,  regrading  philo-
sophy, lets us know he is "less interested in nationalism than humanity."   He 
also  sent  along  over  a megabyte of public domain  programs  from  the  UK.
Thanks,  Gerald, for PDS programs.  And, we try in the future to  view  things 
more  from a whole-world point-of-view.  Mental images aroused by language  we 
usually use is quite different from country to country.  Prime movers are  not 
necessarily  similar  because of dis-similar cultural  upbringings.   But,  we 
still express opinions, take sides, we are seldom in the middle...
     From Elmhurst, IL, James Ott passes along a fix for VID7.Z80 of VLIB v1.1 
for Wyse terminals used in 132-column mode.  James we will use your code  when 
we upgrade The Libraries.  Thanks!
     Russell  Greene,  London, England, writes for information on  using  ZCPR 
v2.0  with  ZRDOS v1.7 and ZCPR v3.3 utilities.  Our advice  is  to  bite-the-
bullet  and install ZCPR v3.3.  It's likely less work to go that way  than  to 
modify  v2.0 for a System Environment Descriptor, needed by the utilities  and 
ZRDOS's PUBLIC directory feature.  We don't support ZCPR v2.0 anymore--it  was 
dropped about five years ago in favor of the more powerful ZCPR v3.0.
     From downunder, Aubrey Keightley, Albany, W.A., Australia, sends a VFILER 
CMD  file using all 60 available characters for user macro commands.  We  like 
"3" command

                 3!get 100 %$ ;go 'Source/data file ' 'Options '

best.   Easy to convert to equivalent ZFILER syntax.  Why is macro so  useful?
You tell us!
     Yes,  Dorothy,  Kansas City, we soon distribute  Bridger  Mitchell's  new 
JetLDR,  linker/loader replacing LDR and LLDR; loads conventional ZS  segments 
plus nine types of REL and special ZRL relocatable files.

Z-User's  Corner.   As promised, here's what Z3LOC v1.5  shows  when  entering 
command Z3LOC Z<cr>:

Version 1.5 shows if 8080/8085, Z80/NSC800 or HD64180/Z180 cpu runs, if new Z-
Com,  lowest RSX and if DateStamper, name of IOP loaded, and type of  terminal 
defined  in Environmental Descriptor.  Display above is for 52-megabyte  Ampro 
Bookshelf  Z80  computer,  running what we call  "full-up"  Z-System.   Notice 
features  beyond  what v1.1 and 1.2 showed.  Version 1.5  begins  support  for 
dynamic Z-Com v2.0 environments and their implications.
     You  have  seen  term RSX used lately, here and in other  places  in  the 
community.   Well, yes, it comes from DRI's CP/M v3.0 (aka CP/M Plus)  legacy.
Resident  System  eXtensions  are  simply programs  that  Terminate  and  Stay 
Resident  (TSR) in local RAM, i.e., a Memory Resident Package  (MRP),  generic 
term  EI promotes for add-function filters/processors that  locate  themselves 
either  under  existing  CCP or above DOS to extend OS,  either  CCP  or  DOS, 
functionality.  However...
     An RSX doesn't permit overwriting the OS's CCP memory space (2k-bytes, 16 
records)  by an application program.  An RSX loads (places) itself just  under 
the base of the CCP, taking as much memory space downward, i.e., from CCP base 
to  a lower address, as it needs to do its job.  But system memory economy  is 
greatest  by  strategically,  dynamically using RCP  and  above-BDOS  buffers, 
adjusting  their  size  and functionality as required to get  your  job  done.
Under Z-Com v2.0 this is easy: RCP, FCP, NDR, IOP, and custom buffer space  is 
adjusted to accomplish task functions.  As task requirements change,  segments 
change--now that's dynamic!
     With  so  many  tools at hand, we in 1988 think  more  about  TASKs  than 
APPLICATIONs.   When  creating a menu, what with fast  disk-memory,  ZEX,  and 
ALIAS.CMDs  calling  aliases  controlled  by  ARUNZ,  it's  no  longer   enter 
"wordprocessor" but "create business letter," "create short letter to friend," 
"connect to Z-Node Central."  In each case, much more occurs than just  enter-
ing WordStar, LZED and Term3.

Hardware/Software  Beat.   RAM disks are important to Z80 computes  and  auto-
mated-TASK  execution speed.  (It's much quicker to access solid-state  rather 
than rotating magnetic media in those multiple command aliases.)  If you  have 
an  Ampro  Z80 Little Board or Bookshelf, have you upgraded to  Terry  Hazen's 
MDISK (n/SYSTEMS, Z-News 806-2,3)?  Now's the time to do it what with all  the 
dynamic  things happening in our community.  By the way, Ampro  Computers  has 
moved  to  greatly  expanded facilities at  1130  Mountain  View/Alviso  Road, 
Sunnyvale,  CA 94089, 408/734-2800.  If you haven't contacted them lately  now 
may be the time to do it.
     EMEX 2400 bit-per-second (bps) modem comes through our testing with  fly-
ing  colors (Z-News 807-3).  As good as the best, a super value!  If  you  are 
still  using a 1200 bps communications machine and wish to double your  speed, 
get your 2400 unit from Bruce Morgen at NAOG--support those who support you!
     While on the subject of modems, "baud" terminology dies slowly.  Original 
meaning  was applied to slow-speed electro-mechanical signaling devices.   Now 
term  is  usually  applied incorrectly to  multi-level  high-speed  electronic 
modems.   A modern 2400-bps modem uses "Phase Shift Keying" as the  subcarrier 
modulation  technique  and  600 baud signaling, four  levels  at  each  binary 
condition; 1200-bps, two levels.  A different modulation technique, "Frequency 
Shift  Keying," is used with 300 baud modems--here 300 baud equals  300  bps--
with  only  one level for ones and zeroes.  When stating speed of  modems  you 
can't  go  wrong if you use bits per second, bps, to  indicate  transfer  date 
rate.
     And by the way, if you use Term3, get file TI24-23.Z80 for use with  2400 
bps modems, on Z-Nodes.  Original TI (Telephone Interface) was only for  1200-
and-below modems.
==============================================================================
Of  Angels and Eagles.  You know, from our perspective high in  these  10,000-
foot  mountains, it seems we are always getting close to a final  solution  to 
our  problems  using  computers as productivity tools.   It  is  so  seductive 
amongst  this  clear and clean air--air angels and  eagles  breathe--to  think 
these machines are going to solve our problems; they do move problems  further 
into/down  the horizon so we are less conscious of what reality is.  Seems  we 
are very asleep even when we are fully awake...
     You know, if the only tool you have is a hammer, you tend to find  things 
to bang on, put nails into.  If we don't understand how what we use works, how 
can  we  understand  the product produced by the thing.  How  can  we  further 
understand ourselves if we don't dig into the subject.  How can we so  coverup 
the  inner workings of our computers that we are unable to write aliases  that 
automate our TASKs, much less write code to change the OS or its utilities.
     We  come to believe the impossible is possible when it comes  to  solving 
our  problems.   Solutions are not along directions  of  conventional  wisdom.
Getting  more money makes us more comfortable physically, gives us  more  toys 
that  occupy  more of our time, but does having money equate to  happiness  or 
fulfillment?  We see no evidence that supports money and fun exclusively going 
together.   Remember  Douglas  Adams' Hitchhiker's Guide  to  the  Galaxy  and 
evolution  of people's problems: First, how to get food to eat?  Next, why  do 
we  need to eat?  Then, where do we have lunch today?  Survival  then  inquiry 
followed  by  sophistication.   Remember  Socrates'  protagonists  the   Greek 
Sophists?  If so, you know to where sophistication leads. 

           "Toto, I've got a feeling we're not in Kansas anymore."

     Everybody  knows that something is eternal, must be!  It's not  Earth  or 
even Sun or Stars...when they are gone, we are left with, well...see you  down 
the lines...
