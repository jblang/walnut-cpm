EI                            Z-NEWS 807                       18 January 1987
==============================================================================
Of  Significance.  We are just about fully moved into the Tahoe location.   EI 
and  its  office manager, Joseph, and family, are there  but  your  newsletter 
editor  and his wife are not--hopefully by the end of March all us folks  will 
be  there,  and  back on a smoothly running  newsletter  production  schedule.
Notice our new address and phone numbers at end of newsletter.  Stay with  us!
The best is yet to come...
     The  first  Z-System  Festival was held in  Hartford,  Connecticut  on  5 
December  1987.   Sponsored  by Connecticut CP/M  Users  Group,  Lee  Bradley, 
President,  talks and workshops covered many aspects of  Z-System  operations; 
Jay Sage was keynote speaker.  Jim Thompson, and others, explained how and why 
Z-System  was so useful to them, over vanilla CP/M.  (Best as we can tell,  Z-
System buff, Rick Swenton, was prime force causing such a faire.  Bravo!)
     New  products  galore  from  Echelon channel:  ZRDOS  becomes  ZSDOS  (or 
whatever  we decide to call it), is enhanced with a heavy work-over of  Herman 
T. Brugge's P2DOS.  Cameron Cotrill and Hal Bower do the work, hopefully  with 
significant  input from Carson Wilson.  Goal is to make all our DOSs from  any 
source   compatible  and  user  non-intimidating,  run  or  at  least   handle 
DateStamper  and PUBlic.  New, greatly enhanced version of Z-COM (Z-Com  v2.0) 
from  Joe Wright, and Z33 on 3 (a name  likely to change, auto-install  ZCPR33 
on  CP/M  Plus machines) and ZOS for HD64180 and Z280  machines  from  Bridger 
Mitchell.   Our assembler is being greatly enhanced beyond ZAS v3.05 and  will 
get a new name, something like EZASM--Al Hawley, author of ZAS v3.0 and beyond 
and  REVAS, does the work.  We can expect a ZCPR v3.4 from Jay Sage with  lots 
of  new  features, Type 4 utilities and extended TCAP and more.  And  The  New 
Libraries  from  Ken Taschner (Z-News 708-5), plus a super toolbox  for  Turbo 
Modula-2 from Steve Cohen--all products to stream from Echelon's Z-Team during 
1988.   Much to keep our eyes on to improve our computing  environment.   Stay 
with us for excitement...

From The  Mail Box.  Lots of mail has been received from hundreds of users  of 
Z-System...we  have  not been able to respond directly to much of it.   As  we 
have said before: we read it all, and react as best we can.  We listen to your 
complaints  and to your praise.  We simply don't have enough hours in the  day 
to provide personal replies to the mail we receive each week.

Software Update Service.  Wow!  The files of SUS #13 at shipping time:

                     DIRectory, Version 1.4  01/22/86
 -SUS    .013    0r| PACK10  .LBR   12 | RCPMAKE .LBR   46 | SALIAS  .LBR   52 
 SHOW12B .LBR   40 | SNIGLETS.       6 | T3S10   .LBR   14 | VCOMP13 .LBR   28 
 VLU101  .LBR   38 | XECHO   .LBR    8 
          F0:BACKUP -- 10 files using 244k (142k remain of 386k total)

     PACK  is a fast file defragmenter from Frank Cringle, Scotland,  (program 
is  ten  times faster than RESTORE) with ability to put files where  you  want 
them on the disk tracks.  RCPMAKE is new Z-Node Central Sysop Ron  Bardarson's 
assembly language utility to automatically update INCLUDE files that have been 
changed since last assembly.  Similar to Unix MAKE utility.  You hackers  will 
want this one.
     SALIAS is Rob Friefeld's alias editor that does it all.  We need no other 
stand-alone-alias  editing utility; it's what we had in mind for  MKALIAS  (Z-
News 204-1).  Also from Rob, VCOMP, a ZCPR3 program that makes comparing  dis-
similar  files easy--a super enhancement of ZRDOS COMP.  SNIGLETS is a  funny, Šcontains words that should be in the dictionary but aren't.  And, T3S is  Dave 
McCord's  Term3 communications utility for transmitting files to  RAS  message 
handlers.   Has  able to delay after each line is sent, as needed by  so  many 
remote  access  message editors.  Jay Sage's XECHO is  a  disk-based  enhanced 
ECHO, a precursor to ECHO of ZCPR v3.3.
     And  last  is best: Michal Carson has written a Z-Tool  that  effectively 
supplements  NULU; finally it's been done.  VLU functions along the  lines  of 
VFILER  and ZFILER, all with a similar super-tool user interface.  But,  don't 
get rid of your NULU just yet; you need it for deleting library files and  re-
krunching.
     Here's the way SUS #14 shapes up at press time:

                     DIRectory, Version 1.4  01/22/86
 -SUS    .014    0r| ACOPY17 .LBR   26 | DD15    .LBR   18 | DEV11A  .LBR   10 
 ERASE51A.LBR   14 | ERAZ10  .LBR   20 | GEN180  .LBR   16 | MOVE21B .LBR   14 
 PUBPTZ10.LBR   16 | RENAM33A.LBR   20 | RENAMZ14.LBR   24 | UNERAZ10.LBR   24 
 ZLT10   .LBR   26 
          F0:BACKUP -- 13 files using 228k (158k remain of 386k total)         

     Five  programs  (ACOPY,  DD, ERAZ, RENAMZ,  and  UNERAZ--all  written  to 
support  big RAMdisk for Ampro Z80 computers, Z-News 806-2) from  Terry  Hazen 
(nSYSTEMS,  21460  Bear Creek Road, Los Gatos, CA 95030) work with  file  name 
attribute  bits to ease life using RAMdisks and places where groups  of  files 
can  be  tagged by using attribute.  These programs add another  dimension  to 
file and disk management on any Z80 computer running Z-System.
     GEN180  converts  Microsoft's M80 into an HD64180  assembler,  thanks  to 
Herbert Oppman of Erlangen, West Germany.
     DEV11A,   ERASE51A,   MOVE12B,  RENAM33A,  and ZLT10 are  Bruce  Morgen's 
handy work, brings these utilities into the modern Z33 world.
     We  thank  all who enhance tools and programs that take advantage  of  Z-
System features.  Please continue sending in your offerings for our review and 
possible inclusion on SUS diskettes.

Z-Node  News.   Ron Bardarson has taken over sysop duties of  Z-Node  Central.
RAS  is in San Jose and permits easy PC Pursuit access.  Ron comes to us  with 
much  engineering experience and is watching the Zilog Z280 product  with  de-
light.   Any  questions along those lines usually  receives  an  authoritative 
answer.   David  McCord  is still within short range to keep Ron  out  of  RAS 
troubles.   Our thanks go out to Dave for long and tedious efforts  as  Z-Node 
Central  Sysop, all much appreciated.  Messages for Dave should be left on  Z-
Node Central, 408/432-0821.
     Z-Node  #65, Barron McIntire, Sysop, has a new number,  307/638-1917,  in 
Cheyenne,  Wyoming.   Call him and leave warm messages--he needs  such  things 
this time of year.
     New  Z-Node #77 is run by James "Pat" Price in Austin, TX.  Equipment  is 
Kaypro 10 and number is 512/444-8691.
     Another new Z-Node, #78, is online.  Gar Nelson, Sysop, runs an Ampro and 
Northstar from Olympia, WA.  Called Byte-It RAS, number is 206/943-4842,  with 
30 megabytes online.
     We are working on a current active Z-Node list.  Watch for it.

Z-User's  Corner.  Power (and wisdom) of original VFILER/VMENU user  interface 
has  been fully established with distribution of library manager  called  VLU, 
Video  Library  Utility.  Operation is essentially intuitive for us  who  have 
used ZFILER, VFILER, and VMENU for some length of time.Š     Our  "universal"  typer,  of file CMD.LBR, SUS  #12,  and  Z-News  803-4, 
permits, from V/ZFILER macro, the viewing of all types of files, uncompressed, 
squeezed,  and crunched, in and out of libraries.  That interface is  compared 
to  the  "V" command from within VLU.  Move pointer to file to  be  typed  and 
press V.  That's it--very fast.  But with a combination of ZLT (Bruce Morgen's 
LT),  TLF, and VTYPE in a multiple command line you automatically are able  to 
type out (view) files, in or out of libraries.  The point we make is there are 
many  ways  to get the job done using Z-System: command line  entry,  aliases, 
menus,  and screen-oriented user interfaces.  The integrated utilities,  e.g., 
VFILER, usually get the job done faster but a the price of inflexibility.  Now 
don't  get us wrong; these super-utilities have been carefully designed to  do 
what  most  of  us  want done; that's why they  are  so  good--they  meet  the 
majority-needs.   But what's so great about Z-System, we still have the  small 
tools, Unix operating system philosophy tools, to stitch together to do things 
that maybe the super-tool cannot do.
     For us learning users, there's a new Good-Neighbor Helper available: Paul 
Hermon, 1804 E. 31st Street, Minneapolis, MN 55407, 612/724-1837.  Paul is  an 
expert  on Kaypro and Sanyo machines.  Give him a call if you need  help.   (A 
new list of G-N Helpers is being drafted and soon should be off the pr

Hardware/Software  Beat.   Bridger Mitchell, Echelon Vice  President  and  ZOS 
developer,  offers a software product to permit easy access to  PC-DOS  files.
Called  DosDisk, reads, writes, renames, creates, deletes, MS-DOS  files,  and 
even  runs  CP/M programs stored on a PC disk.  PC-DOS files, i.e.,  all  text 
files, are directly handled by CP/M-compatible programs without having to copy 
from DOS disk to CP/M disk.  Price is $25.00 plus $3.00 shipping and handling, 
for  preconfigured versions: Kaypro w/TurboROM, Ampro Little Broad,  Commodore 
C-128,  SB180/SB180FX, Oneac ON!, Morrow MD3/11.  Order direct  from  Bridger, 
410 23rd Street, Santa Monica, CA 90402.
     We  use  a new 2400-bps modem, EMEX 2400, available from  North  American 
One-eighty Group, NAOG, the HD64180/Z180 people, P.O. Box 2781, Warminster, PA 
18974, 215/443-9031.  Main features are price ($225.00) and compatibility with 
Hayes  AT standard and with Bell and CCITT foreign standards.  We'll give  you 
our  recommendations when we have sufficient experience with EMEX  to  justify 
our position.

Of Angels and Eagles.
    Peace begins when expectation ends.
    A person must have the right to choose, even to choose wrong, if  choosing 
      right is ever to be learned.
    Enjoy present pleasures in such ways as not to injure future ones.
    If  you cannot find happiness along the way, you will not find it  at  the 
      end of the road.  Most of us spend a lot of time dreaming of the future, 
      never realizing a little arrives each day.
    Every  action  of  our  lives touches some  chord  that  will  vibrate  in 
      eternity.
    Don't be afraid to take a big step when one is indicated.  You can't cross 
      a chasm in two small jumps.  Move out of life's safe and shallow  places 
      and venture forth into the deeps.
    Sometimes the needs of a few outweigh the needs of the many.
