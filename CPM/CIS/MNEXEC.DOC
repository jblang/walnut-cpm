DOCUMENTATION for MICRONET EXECUTIVE SOURCE CODE - 10/03/81
-----------------------------------------------------------

Thanks   to  the  generosity  of  Wiz-10  and  the  MicroNet
management, we have been  authorized  to  distribute  source
code  for  the  MicroNet  executive.   In  return  for  this
courtesy,  we  ask  that  all  users  please  preserve   the
copyright  notices  in all future modificationns and updates
of the code.  Note that the code contained  therein  is  the
property  of  Compuserve  and thus may not be sold by anyone
else without prior express consent.

Now for the goodies!  The complete package  is  resident  on
[70000,642]  as  a  packed file called CPM.PAK.  You may use
the MNet PAC commands to get a directory, type  files,  copy
individual  files  to  your  UFD,  etc.  Note that there are
several versions of the  executive  available.   It  appears
that  the  latest (and therefore fully-debugged version) for
vanilla CP/M systems is CPMMNE.ASM.  Also be aware that  the
Zenith   (Heath)   version   does   not   incorporate   port
initialization, so you must add this.

We welcome your comments and  encourage  all  CP-MIG'ers  to
customize  the  packages  to  their  hearts'  content.   For
example, I have modified the EXEC to allow me to control  my
PMMI  modem board.  If you think you have a mod or "whistle"
that would be of wide interest, let us know about it!
