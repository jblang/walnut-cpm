How to get to CP-MIG with the least fuss and muss:

     
    The Compuserve Information  System  makes  a  number  of
assumptions  about  a  user when he initially logs in to the
system under a new PPN (account number).  We will go through
a procedure to change these so that  you  can  easily  enter
CP-MIG  and  later on explore other facets of the service if
you so desire.

    The top "page" presented to a user at  login  is  CIS-1,
the   main   table   of   contents.   Choose  item  5,  User
Information, to get to page CIS-4.  Choose  selection  4  to
call  up page DEFALT-1.  This default program is all we need
be concerned with to tailor the user profile to our needs.

    Item 1, terminal type, is initially set to selection  4,
"other".  Do not alter at this time.

    Item  2,  initial  page,  should be changed to MicroNet.
MicroNet is the old name Compuserve used  for  what  is  now
called the personal computing area.  In actuality, it allows
entry  to  the command monitor (the "OK" prompt), similar to
the familiar A> in CP/M.

    Item 3, EMAIL  waiting  action,  should  be  changed  to
automatically run EMAIL if any messages are waiting.  EMAIL,
incidentally,  is Compuserve's electronic mail facility, and
is totally independent of CP-MIG.  It is possible that  some
members  will want to contact you through EMAIL, and in this
mannner you will be able to automatically  retrieve  waiting
mail.

    Item  4,  terminal  parameters,  is  a  rather  involved
procedure in which you define  the  hardware  parameters  of
your  data  terminal  equipment.   Items  such as case, line
length and nulls after <CR> are handled here.

    Item 5 allows you to set a brief mode  to  supress  many
menus.   If  the  menu  is  required, responding with a <CR>
rather than a choice will bring it up.

    Item 6 enables an optional auto-run of a  program.   You
may plug CP-MIG in here if you so desire.

    Lastly   item   7  will  summarize  your  newly  created
defaults.  Note that the system will store this  information
associated  with  your  account  number  and  it need not be
re-entered unless you want to change a default.

    Note that there is also an OP command in CP-MIG (OPtion)
which should also be used once in the SIG  and  which  makes
some  related  requests.   Luckily  you need only go through
this once!
