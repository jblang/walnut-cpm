(Some thoughts on safe usage of computers)

Q.  I heard that working on computers can be detrimental to your
health.  Is this so?

A.  The health problems usually associated with working on Video
Display Terminals (VDT) or computer monitor are in many instances
the combined effects of several stress factors.  Among the causes
are poor machine design and maintenance, incorrect office layout
and lighting and too much time at the machine.  It is not always
possible to say that one specific factor is causing problems.  It
is, however, possible by identifying and eliminating stress
causing situations to improve conditions and relieve symptoms.

Some suggestions for relieving some stress factors follow:

Do not work on a VDT for more than two hours at a time.  Allow
yourself at least 15 minutes an hour doing work that requires
looking at a distance and requires looking at a distance and
requires some body movement.

Eliminate bright light from behind the computer, such as the sun
shining in windows.

Adjust brightness and contrast controls for the most comfortable
viewing levels.
