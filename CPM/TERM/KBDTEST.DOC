Re:   KBDTEST program for Xerox 820-II

This was written in Turbo by one of our 820 tech.reps.  He uses it to
test the keyboards to verify that all are working.  It is fairly self
explanitory.  It uses the 820-II's graphics so KBDTEST will not work
with the 820-I.  Turn the LOCK off first. Then touching any key will
'white' the square out.  A SHIFTED-any key will turn the key 'color'
off again.  The program is modeled after the test routine of the Alto.

Enjoy,
