Sub: c128 cp/m startup

 Chuck... Assuming that you are a c128 user, what is the best way
to get started in commodore 128 cp/m.  My main problem right  now
is  I have no way to dl programs from the round table onto a cp/m
formatted  disk.  What would you recommend?  And what would be  a
good  way to see what cp/m has available for it?  Are  there  any
cp/m magazines out?
					Thanks For Your Time, Todd

Todd...
.
Thanks for your inquiry, it is always a pleasure to meet and help
out  new GEnie members.  I've been on line for about a  year  and
three months now and can remember struggling the first few months
my self.
:
In answer to your first question,  I will assume you are using  a
C-128,  1571 and 80 Column Monitor as a minimum system configura-
tion.  If  you are not using an 80 column monitor leave me a note
and  I  will get you some instructions to adapt  your  40  column
monitor to a Mono Chrome 80 Column monitor.
:
The  Best and easiest program I could recommend for C-128 to CP/M
transfers  is a public domain program found here on GEnie in  the
Commodore  S/W Libraries called CROSSLINK2.LBR File No.  3023  in
Lib.  09.  It  runs in native C-128 mode.   It will allow you  to
transfer to and from  Commodore,  CP/M  and  MSDOS  disk formats.
It will make the initial transfers you will be making as painless
as  possible.   It is fully menu driven and comes with documenta-
tion  to help you figure out how to use it  After you're  up  and
running  in  CP/M  mode  I would suggest a  CP/M  program  called
RDCBM21.LBR File No.  3733 Lib.  34 in the CP/M S/W Libraries. It
will  allow  you to read a Commodore disk  format while  your  in
CP/M mode.
:
I  would also recommend that you down load the C-128MEX.COM  CP/M
terminal program (File No.  2530 lib 34 CP/M R.T.) along with  my
short  tutorial MEXHELP.DZC (File No.  4377 Lib 34 CP/M R.T.)  to
get  you started.  If you down load your files with MEX you won't
have to convert them too CP/M format.  If you are already on line
and familiar with tellecomunicating procedures you should be able
to  get  the hang of MEX with out too much difficulty.  The  only
difference between mex and Commodore Term programs is that it  is
a  command  line  driven  program as opposed  to  a  menu  driven
program.  When  you stop and think about what it is that you want
to do all terminal programs perform the same functions so with  a
little  patience you should be able to master MEX pretty  quickly
and  the  effort  will  be  well rewarded  as  you will  find  it
to  be a very powerful piece of communications software and  give
you  some advantages and features not found in  native  Commodore
Term S/W.
:
:
Concerning what is available...
Run  and on line search of the CP/M Library No.  34.  To do  this
move  to the CP/M Software Libraries by typing M,686 at any GEnie
Menu Prompt or when you sign on. Once you get to this Menu Select
the  Set  Libraries option and follow the prompts until  you  are
presented with the Commodore Library selection (Lib No.  34)  Use
either  option  2  or  3 to get a listing of the  files  in  this
Library (follow the prompts either one will give you the  listing
they  just  list them in different order and option 3 will  allow
you  to  do  selective file searches as opposed  to  listing  the
entire  Library).  Note the programs in Library 34 are  known  to
work   on a C-128 however this is not the only place to find CP/M
software  for  your  128. Other programs in the CP/M R.T. may  be
compatible with your 128,  this is just a good place to start.
:
:
For more help in getting started I suggest you down load the CP/M
Primer  series  of articles written by Michael  Mantino  (MikeM),
file  Numbers 2122,  2247,  and 2413 also in Lib 34.  They are an
excellent  introduction  to using your 128 in CP/M  mode  and  go
beyond the material found in your 128 Users manual.
:
:
Concerning  CP/M  Magazine..  I used too down load  READ  $  ONLY
Magazine.  The  publication  was very informative an  interesting
reading related to both CP/M and MSDOS machines. Many of the back
issues are still here on GEnie and you can get a listing by doing
an  on line search in the CP/M Libraries by using  "MAGAZINE"  as
the search string.  The author got into Desk Top Publishing a few
months   back  and  has since  stopped  publishing  (New TOYs are
addictive) However,  I'm sure you will glean a lot of good  stuff
by  down  loading the back issues as I did and they will  broaden
your scope of Personal Computing knowledge as well.  Also you may
want  to  check the Flagship "Starboard Journal" a  Semi  regular
GEnie Commodore magazine found in Library No.  1 on the Commodore
R.T.
:
:
One last Tip...
If  you are going to use your 128 in CP/M mode on a regular basis
and are really serious about getting into 128 CP/M MODE. I highly
suggest  that you purchase a 1750 Ram expansion module.  It is  a
cheap  alternative to a second disk drive and will allow  you  to
overcome  the  infamous Commodore Slow drive problem by  allowing
you  to use it as a true RAM Disk an option not yet available  to
this date in native 128 mode.

Well Todd,
This  ought  to get you thinking.  If you've got  more  questions
after reading all this or you get stuck on any of the above  give
me a holler and I'll be glad to help.
