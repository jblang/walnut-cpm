==============================


     I will be the first to admit that it took me about six weeks to
figure out how to get my MEX terminal program to run in a functional
usable way despite the fact that I had already mastered several C-64 and
C-128 communications programs.  The biggest reason for this is due
mainly to the cryptic documentation (from a beginning telecommunicators
standpoint) and the Command Line orientation of the program versus Pull
Down Menu Structure of the more GRAPHICS oriented Native 128 and 64
Software.

     However, these initial problems aside MEX is a Powerful piece of
Communications Software and, when used with your Ram Expansion Module
can allow you to download up to half a megabyte of information in one
continuous block which is great for transferring databases and large
files not limited to the smaller disk and Ram buffers sizes of the C-64
C-128 Modes of your computer.  Using the Ram Expansion Module and Mex
gives you the Telecommunications power of computers costing hundreds if
not thousands of dollars more than your C-128.  Once you master a few
simple commands you will be able to take advantage of this feature
packed terminal program and this article is designed to give the basics
to getting up and running.


     Basically all Telecommunications programs are designed to perform
the same functions that is; Connect to a host computer and transfer
information.  More advanced functions will include the use of buffers to
temporarily store data which may be edited before transferring it to an
output device (Screen, Disk or Printer).  Additionally most modern
telecommunications programs will feature Auto Dialing and custom
configuration abilities as well.  MEX offers all of these features and
if you have done these things with other telecommunications software you
will be that much ahead of the game in learning how to use MEX.

     Mex is an evolutionary program to the extent that it follows the
structure and commands of earlier CP/M Communications software.  (MODEM7
is in my mind).  In fact some of the IMP commands are similar to those
used in MODEM7 and MEX.  The point here is that like in 128 and 64 Mode
once you have learned to use one type of term program it is generally
not to difficult to figure out others and the same holds true for the
CP/M side so keep an open mind and this should help you to get it
together much quicker.




Accessing MEX
-------------

     To access MEX from CP/M, make sure the MEX.COM program is in the
logged drive (m:Drive if you're using it in your Ram Disk) and type MEX.

     That's it.   MEX

     To get out and return to DOS just type CPM.

     You will exit MEX and return to DOS.


     Once inside MEX like other terminal programs you are not
automatically in terminal mode but are in a holding area so to speak
where you may select a program function you want to perform, eg. Set
system parameters, send or receive files, open a capture file, enter
terminal mode, etc.  This is no different than being presented with a
main menu in one of your Commodore term programs except with MEX they
forgot to present you with the menu.  To get help you will need to ask
for it which is what the command line prompt is used for.  Type in a ?
at the prompt and you will be presented with a list of commands you may
use from NON/TERMINAL mode.  Some of this should start to look Familiar?



Accessing Terminal Mode.
-----------------------

     To Access Terminal mode type "L" at the MEX Prompt.  This will put
you in local echo mode suitable for communications with GEnie.  Typing a
"T" will put you in terminal mode with no echo and you and you won't be
able to see what your sending.

     To get help in terminal mode press the escape Key and then the ?
key.  Note: Using Escape sequences is a little different than executing
control key sequences.  Don't hold the keys down together at the same
time like executing a control key sequence in WordStar, instead press
the keys separately.



Dialing a Number
----------------

     To Dial a number out type ATDT (if you're using a Hayes Compatible
modem such as a Commodore 1670) preceded by the number you are calling
and then press the return key.

     Eg. ATDT5796440

     The ATDT must be typed in capital letters or your modem won't
recognize that you are sending it a command.

     The program will then dial the number and if a carrier is detected
within in the proscribed delay time the computers will hook up.

     Once you have logged on to the system you can follow its prompts
for the most part and begin your telecommunications session.

     NOTE: The program is capable of autodialing which can be accessed
from non terminal mode using the CAL command however we're not going to
get into this in this article for the sake of KISS (keeping it simple
stupid).



Capturing Text
--------------

     Many times online you will find that you would like to retain the
information being displayed to your screen.  With MEX you may capture a
block of text by creating a buffer file.  To do this you must exit
terminal mode briefly.  This is done by first hitting the escape key and
then the E (for Exit) key.  Again, Press the two keys separately and you
should find your self back in non-terminal mode staring at a MEX Prompt.
At this point creating a buffer file is as simple as pie.

     Type,

     l filname.doc

     whereas l = (return to local terminal mode)
        filename.doc = (Any legal CPM filename.)

     and then press return.

     This will send you back to terminal mode were you will get a
message telling you that the ASCII buffer has been turned on.  Also any
time that you see a line starting with a (:) it is being captured.

     To toggle the buffer on and off in terminal mode press the Escape
key and the U key to turn the capture off and Esc S to Start capturing.

     Note: You can't turn the capture on and off if you haven't opened
a buffer file.

     Other Nifty Esc Sequences to know are:

     Esc @ to send a break command to the Host computer

                        and

     Esc T to transmit a text file from Disk or Ram Disk to the host
Computer, for uploading pre-written GEnie E-Mail.


Transferring Binary Files.
-------------------------

     Transferring Binary files is just as simple.  First you must exit
terminal mode as above (Press Esc E).  The protocol is essentially the
same here, type either an S for Send or R for Receive followed by a
space and then the Drive/User# followed by the file name.

     For example to receive a file named SMART.COM type,

     R A0:SMART.COM

     To Transmit the same file type,

     S M0:SMART.COM

     Note: If you do not designate drive and user specifications MEX
will assume the default drive and user specs.


     Mex will open the file and display the block number being
transmitted or received as the case may be during the transfer.  When
the transfer has been completed you will be returned to the non-terminal
mode where you must instruct the program to return you terminal mode to
regain communications with the host computer to download another file,
log off, or whatever.

     Well, that's it, the above will get you started and after you've
begun to perform these basic functions you may be able to understand the
more cryptic instructions in the MEX Users Guide and maybe you won't but
I think this will open the door for most of you out there.

     If you have questions I'll be glad to help in any way I can as I am
sure Michael Mantino (GEnie Commodore/CP/M SYSOP) Michael.M will in a
lot of cases offer his valuable assistance as well.
