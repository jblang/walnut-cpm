   I found a way to do some kind of change. (Not the one I wanted however.) 
With the Dec 8Bios the command CONF POKE fbdb=96fb will create a new drive F:
that seems to be a mirror of m: except that all of M: files are there ut if
you put files on f: they are not assecable from m: It seems to set up a
separate directory since the same file can be a sys file on one drive and a
dir file on the other.

Hmmm...interesting find.  I'll have to play around with that one a bit.

That is an interesting discovery, all right.  Can I ask why you were trying to
change the drive number in the first place? Just curious, I haven't run into
any programs which wouldn't  ddress the unit as M: without trouble.

I've found a few that only allow a certain range of drives.  PCFILE lets you
use A thru D only, for example.  (And *that* is one program that would be real
nice to have address drive M:)

Yes, I would also *LOVE* to be able to change to another drive name  and
someone mentioned another DREAM of mine: on bootup, make CP/M  look to drive
M: for the startup files! That would be super! Anyway if anyone has any of
these mods, let us know!

I found a way!   Using conf type the following:
   CONF POKE FBD3=96FB    FOR DRIVE B
             FBD5         FOR DRIVE C
             FBD7         FOR DRIVE D
