Why CP/M ?

===========================

     Many  of you C-128 owners have a Giant hiding in the box that came
with  your  computer and probably aren't aware of  it.  It's  the  CP/M
Systems Disk that you've been ignoring and have filed away. Perhaps you
have  tried  to load it and were puzzled by the funny looking  A:  (DOS
Prompt)  that  came  up when it finished  loading.  This  article  will
explain  some of the features of the CP/M+ Operating System  (O/S)  and
Why you might want to take advantage of using it on your 128.

     Two  reasons  for  using CP/M on the 128 are  Power  and  Software
Availability.  Imagine Down Loading the entire Commodore or CP/M  GEnie
Software  Files  Directories (about 300k) and creating a  Usable  Local
Data  Base  file  to  do your own off line searches  and  print  custom
listings.  You  couldn't do that in C-64 or C-128 Mode.  Or  How  about
editing  that 300 page Novel you've been writing for the last 5  years.
The   CP/M O/S  was the first Universally used O/S for  Micro-Computers
and  learning how to use it will give you knowledge of other  computers
as well as to prepare you for using the MSDOS O/S when the time  comes.
Being  the  first O/S means that users have been tinkering and  playing
with  it  for many years and as such there is a great  deal  of  Public
Domain   (Free  Software)  as  well  as  Powerful  Commercial  Software
available  which will allow you to do things you only dreamed of  doing
on your old C-64.

     For example, one of the most widely used Word Processors available
for use on Micro-Computers is called Word Star (tm).   Word Star is  an
80 Column full featured Word Processor containing Spelling Checker  and
Mail Merge options.  It can Create and Edit Documents of unlimited size
(As much Space as you have on your Disk Drive or Ram Disk) and can also
be  used  as an ASCII text file editor for editing Non-Word Star  Files
and  MBasic or Machine Language Source Program files.  Also  Word  Star
Files  created  on your C-128 are fully compatible for use on an  MSDOS
machine if you use one.  Learning how to use Word Star at home at  your
own  speed on your 128 can prepare you for using it at work or  school.
Imagine  what  people will think of you when you sit down  and  already
know  how  use it like a seasoned professional.  It's a great skill  to
have and will enhance your credentials no matter what you do.

     Another  example,  one  of the most popular Data  Base  Management
Systems Available for Micro's is a program called dBase (tm) by  Ashton
Tate.  dBase was originally developed on CP/M machines and has  evolved
to  a Powerful Applications program on MSDOS machines.  In fact it's  a
programing language in it's own right.  dBase II for CP/M is capable of
being run on a C-128. Here again learning to use it at home at your own
speed is a great way to pick up a professional skill. You can use dBase
for  just about any Home or Small Business data base  applications  and
it's  processing capacities and abilities far exceed anything you might
have worked with in 64 mode. Also, If you take advantage of using a Ram
Expansion  Module  you will be able process Data at blinding  speed  as
compared to using the 1541 and 1571 disk drives.

     You can probably pick up legal copies of these Programs at a local
swap  meet  or through  a users group at very reasonable prices but  if
you  can't  afford to buy these right off I can highly  recommend  some
P.D.  Software  Available  here on GEnie that will serve most  of  your
needs  to begin with.  The first is an excellent file editor  which  is
Word  Star  compatible and it's called VDE261 (File #4699 in  the  CP/M
R.T). The Second is a SHAREWARE Data Base Program called PCFILE (File #
2409).  Both of these programs come with documentation contained in the
Library or ARK file which will explain how to use them and are,  I feel
of Commercial Quality.  They would be among the first to start up  your
CP/M software library with.

     Learning  CP/M isn't really any more difficult to do than learning
to use the C-64 or C-128 operating systems.  In fact if you've  already
figured  out  how to Load programs and copy files in Native  Mode  your
half  way there.   When  you  get down  to  it,  all Computers must  do
essentially  the same things to process data.  They have to be able  to
input and output data from devices such as your disk drive, Monitor and
printer.  Once  you have mastered these essential DOS  (Disk  Operating
System)  skills on one computer, learning to do it on another is really
not that hard at all.  It's kind of like learning how to ride a bicycle
or  drive a car.  You need to become proficient and learn your  balance
and  judgment  and once you've acquired the ability to do it  with  one
vehicle  learning how to operate a second one comes easy.  If you  have
used  your  128 in either 64 or 128 mode for a few months and have  got
the basics down moving up to CP/M is not going to be a problem. In fact
you  may find after a while using CP/M is easier than using the 128  in
C-64  Mode.

     The biggest difference between the three operating systems and the
one  you will have to remember the most is that CP/M is a Command  Line
driven  system.  Because it was developed in the early days  of  Micro-
Computing,  things like POP Down Menus and Color Graphics didn't exist.
So  learning to work with the command line is the big  adjustment.  You
will  still  do the same types of DOS functions but you  will  have  to
learn the Lingo.  Fortunately one of the nice things you can do to help
with  the  cryptic command instructions is built right into the  system
and  that  is  to custom configure your keys (All  Keys  not  just  the
Function  Keys)  on  your keyboard.  For example I have  configured  my
function  keys  to  execute  the  commands  to  copy files and  display
directories  at the touch of a key as well as to Dial my favorite  BB'S
and send Log on Strings. The KEYFIG.COM program on the Flip Side of The
CP/M Systems Disk will allow you to configure your Keyboard any way you
want. One interesting trick I've played with my system is to re-program
the  Bracket/Colon  key on my 128 to a Colon/Semi-Colon  key  found  on
MSDOS machines. The point is you can make a lot of the hard things easy
by installing some training wheels, much like using a DOS wedge program
in the C-64/128 modes.

     If  you're   really interested in getting into CP/M and want  some
good  help  in getting up and running see the CP/M Primer  Articles  in
Library  34 of the CP/M RoundTable.  They are File #'s 2122,  2413  and
2247.  They  offer some good beginning tips and go beyond the  material
found  in your 128 users Manual.  I'm going to be writing more articles
for  beginning and intermediate users to supplement these as  well.  If
you have questions or find your self stuck on something drop me some E-
mail and I'll be glad to help in any way I can.   I Hope this instilled
some  inspiration and tickled the imagination in some of you out there,
Don't be bashful I'm looking forward to hearing from you.

Regards,
Carl.....
