 DOCUMENTATION FOR AMODEM VER.  4.2
  TERMINAL PROGRAM.
    
  This file will permit the ATARI
  to access an RCPM BBS that runs
  under the CP/M operating system.
  Also SOME ATARI BB Systems.
  And allow ATARI to ATARI transfer.
  It features uploading and downloading
  at 300 baud and is extremely user
  friendly.
  The file may be listed here with
  command D.     AMODEM4  <Y/N>N
  Then captured and saved to disk.
  Then ENTERed with the interface
  "booted" by an AUTORUN.SYS file.
    
  When RUN, it will go into terminal
  mode at which time the user should
  dial the BBS. Some systems are of
  the RING-BACK variety, so you should
  be prepared to let the phone ring
  ONCE. You will then hang up and
  re-dial 10-15 seconds later.
  When the system connects, type a
  few <returns>s until the BBS responds.
  Follow the HELP commands of the
  system from here.
    
  TRANSLATION - SELECT T will toggle
  the translation mode between ATARI
  (No translation) and ASCII (Light
  translation). Use ATARI on ATARI
  Systems and ASCII on RCPM Systems.
    
  MENU - For ATARI Disk systems, you
  may list your Menus with SELECT M
  or SELECT 1 or 2 or 3 or 4.
  To find files or space for new files.
    
  DUPLEX - For ATARI to ATARI file
  transfer, you will need Half Duplex
  Since AMODEM sends no echo.
  You may toggle it with SELECT P.
  NOTE; Use ATARI Mode on each end.
    
 ---------------------------------
 NOTE: the commands XMODEM S and
 XMODEM R are for RCPM boards only
 For other boards, follow the
 directions for that system!
 For AMIS boards do function D or U
 then answer Y to XMODEM Protocol?
 ---------------------------------

  DOWNLOADING - To download from the
  BBS you must remember that it is
  controlled by a file called XMODEM.
  To have this file send a program to
  your ATARI, you must press <SELECT>
  key and type R to tell the ATARI to
  get ready to receive from XMODEM.
  You must then provide a FILESPEC
  to which the ATARI will save the
  program. This does not necessarily
  have to be the same name as the BBS
  has it saved as.
  Once back in terminal mode, type the
  command; XMODEM S <filename.ext>
  and then RETURN at which time the
  XMODEM controller will respond with
  a statement that it has opened its
  file and is prepared to transmit to
  your ATARI. To begin the procedure,
  press the START key and sit back
  and relax. The XMODEM will send the
  file, which can be of any type.
  The screen will turn RED and when
  the file has been downloaded, your
  ATARI will save it to your filespec.
  When the screen turns back to BLUE,
  the process is complete.
    
  TO UPLOAD - Reverse the procedure
  by pressing the SELECT and S keys
  to indicate you will Send to XMODEM
  the ATARI <filespec><RETURN>.
  Then type; XMODEM R <filename.ext>
  and RETURN which will tell XMODEM to
  prepare a filearea under that name
  to store the program you are going
  to send TO the BBS. To initiate
  the upload, press the START key and
  the computers will take over. Your
  screen will turn GREEN until the
  transfer is completed.
    
  TO CAPTURE DATA - Press SELECT then
  C and enter a filespec. To start 
  press the START or OPTION key.
  All data that you see on the screen
  will be saved to memory. You may
  toggle the capture on and off with
  the OPTION key. When you are done,
  or the buffer is full, you can press;
  SELECT and D. This will Dump the
  memory to your filespec.
    
  NOTE ABOUT ATARI <FILESPEC>

  and filename and type. Example;
  D:MYFILE.BAS  or  D2:YOUR.PGM

  ************************************

  NOTE-
  
  There are many different versions of
  the AMODEM terminal program in use.
  The major versions <2.0, 3.0, 4.0>
  were released by the author, while
  the "sub-versions <3.1, 3.2, 4.1...>
  were mostly prepared as personal
  modifications by ATARI enthusiasts
  from all over the USA. For the most
  part, they added features such as 
  mmultiple disk drive access or duplex
  toggles that were gathered together
  and refined by Jim, and included as
  standard features in the subsequent
  major version. 
  
  One such sequence of evolution that
  illustrates this best, is the <M>enu
  option.
  
  Version 3.0 had send/recieve/menu 
  access from D1: only. Ver. 3.1 added
  all 4 drive availability to this.
  When 4.0 was released in 10/82 this
  was a standard feature. Ver. 4.1
  modifies line 4000 and adds 2 other
  lines that permits the same <M>enu
  scroll of every drive as 4.0, but
  now permits the user to type simply
  a single number <1,2,3,4> to have 
  only that single menu shown.
