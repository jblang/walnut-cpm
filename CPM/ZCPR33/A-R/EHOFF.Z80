; PROGRAM: EHOFF
; VERSION: 0.1
; WRITTEN: Bruce McIntosh
;
; This is a VERY primitive, quick-and-dirty utility to shut off the
; error handlers under ZCPR3.3.  I wrote it becuase I couldn't get
; ERRORX to function under ZCPR3.3.  It's actually the first real,
; useful program I've written for my micro (bring out the party
; favors and celebrate *grin* )!
