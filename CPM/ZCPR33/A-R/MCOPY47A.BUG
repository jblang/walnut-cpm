MCOPY47A.BUG						February 21, 1988
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

A bug was introduced into mcopy beginning with version 4.7a.  It only occurs
when copying large files while running under an RSX.  Specifically, my
problem occured while running Poor Man's Network under ZCPR3.0, ZRDOS 1.7,
MENU 4.1, and the file size was 36K.  Small files seem to transfer with no 
problems.  Poor Man's Network has been eliminated as the source of the 
problem, because the failure will occur even when performing a 'local' 
copy on the same machine.  When the RSX is removed, the same 36K file will
mcopy fine with version 4.7a.

In reviewing the updates from mcopy version 4.6 (which works fine) to version
4.7a, 'buffer sizing where an RSX is present' was one of the updates.

The following text is from MCOPY47.FOR:

DateStamper support via DSLIB, use faster CRC3 routines from 
SYSLIB4, more Z80-specific code to trim things down, deleted old 
LDED macro, improved buffer sizing where an RSX is present, 
vastly simplified option processing code, re-ordered user- 
definable options so they could be copied with a block move, 
added $SYS file exclusion option, etc., etc.
