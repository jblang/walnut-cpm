to DAVID MCCORD about DT42 STATUS

After trying rather hard to get the DT42 to serve my purposes, I have,
at least for the moment, given up.  There were just too many small
problems that kept popping up from time to time.  And there were also
some large problems.  I could never find a way to get DateStamper to work
on the system, even after I went into the code and made some changes that
would allow for the nonstandard DOS size.  Have you gotten it running?
If so, I would be very interested in knowing how you did it.
 
I also could not get PMATE to work on it.  The problem with the first 3
bytes of every record of a file read in using the XI macro could not be
eradicated.  This version of PMATE has worked without the slightest
problem on the Ampro, SB180, BigBoard I, Televideo 803H, and ATR8000.
So I have to conclude that there is something funny with the DT42.
 
Instead, I brought up XBIOS and the ETS-180-IO+ board on my SB-180.  Boy
is that nice!  I have 40 MB of hard disk running, a great real-time clock,
DateStamper running in banked memory.  The whole thing was quite easy to
bring up.  And I am sure BGii will run as well (in contrast to the DT42).
I will be building a system with the DT42 later, so keep me posted on it.
