                         WordStar 4.0 Newsflash
                          For ZCPR Fans

     Would you perhaps be interested in a WordStar 4.0 for CP/M with
direct ZCPR/Z-System support built in?  Does the thought of WS
recognition of named directories make your blood run hot?  Does the idea
of PATH searching by "Run Command" from inside WS drive all thought of
Paulina Porizkova from your brain?  Do I have your attention?

     This little fantasy is not yet realized...  BUT, recent
conversation with an unnamed but highly placed source* within Micro Pro
revealed that direct ZCPR support for WS 4.0 is now being given serious
consideration. What MicroPro does NOT have is an indication of how much,
if any, interest there is out there in the buying public for this, may I
say laudable, concept.

     If you as a ZCPR user are potentially interested in WS-ZCPR
handshake capability, this source* has asked me to pass on his request
to the Z-User community to please send letters expressing that
interest...  Soon, as major development decisions will be made within
the next few weeks.  It is also my thought that this will be an
unparalleled opportunity for end-user input and ideas on how Z-Wordstar
should operate.

     So get those post-cards and letters comin' in folks.  (Our source*
asks that you NOT call.)

Send them to:

                Mr. Lee Lensky*
