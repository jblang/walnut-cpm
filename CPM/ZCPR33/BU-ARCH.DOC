After backing up your files several times, have you ever found
that you had the same file on several different disks or could
not "remember" which disk a particular file was on so you could
put its natural update on the same disk or even overwrite the
outdated one?

It's one thing to be even close to having the right disk, but
when you are using floppies that only hold 126k it can become
ridiculous.  Hence, I created the following aliases.  Their
success is primarily responsible to Steve Cohen for creating W20
and to Jay Sage and Rob Wood for updating the wildcard shell to
W21 and W22 successively.

I chose AC for most of my work because it tells me when a floppy
disk is full and allows me to insert another and continue my
backup process.  I am not fond of the archive bit being set on
destination file, but what can you do when the author does not
see it that way.  Alas, I use SFA to turn it off when I have
completed work on a floppy.  Also, I have modified W22 to display
inverse in the header (w22x in aliases) and have included an
inverse ECHO display in my aliases for aesthetic purposes.

The first alias is simply to move files with the archive bit off
into a user area named BACKUP:.  I chose ACOPY because I am able
to control the destination archive bit.  If I want to move non-
archived files from all user areas into BACKUP:, I would use AC,
then SFA to set up my archiving process to FLOPPY1:.

BAK a7:acopy17 backup:=*.* /no


The next two aliases basically log onto my floppy disk named
FLOPPY1:, reads the first file name, then checks to see if it is
waiting to be transfered to the floppy from the BACKUP area.  If
it is, it moves it.  If it is not, the alias moves to the next
floppy filename and repeats the process.  When all files on the
floppy is checked, I put in another floppy and repeat.

ARC cls;e0:;a15:w22x archive *.*;a15:sfa *.* /-arc;$d0$u0:

ARCHIVE if ex e0:$1;a15:ac44 floppy1:=backup:$1 /aeo;a15:sak
/p4;cls;echo  <W V%>ers. 2.2 installed> ;else;fi


Optionally, for those of you that like ACOPY

ARK cls;e0:;a15:w22x arch *.*;a15:sfa *.* /-arc;$d0$u0:

ARCH if ex e0:$1;a7:acopy17 floppy1:=backup:$1 /mo;a15:sak
/p4;cls;echo  <W V%>ers. 2.2 installed> ;else;fi


The final alias simply takes the remaining files from BACKUP: and
moves them to a FLOPPY1:.

BACKUP a15:ac44 floppy1:=backup:*.* /ae;a15:sfa e0:*.* /-arc


Enjoy these if they make any sense to you.  Any comments can be
left on Jay Sage's or Al Hawley's Z-Nodes and of course if you
can get through to Z-Node Central... Jim
