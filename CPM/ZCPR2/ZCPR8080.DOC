                 DOCUMENTATION FOR ZCPR8080.ASM


ZCPR8080 is an 8080 translation of ZCPR2 by Richard Conn, a Z80 
CCP (Console Command Processor) replacement for CP/M version 2.2.
Being a long-time user of ZCPR1 as well as a member of the group
that assisted Richard Conn with testing and development of ZCPR2, 
I was dismayed at the thought of having to abandon it and return 
to the stock CCP when migrating to my newly-purchased Compupro 
8085/88 CPU board. Inspection of the ZCPR2 file made it obvious 
that it would not be a difficult task to convert to 8080 code, 
the result being ZCPR8080.ASM. 

All other files in the ZCPR2 package may be used in their 
distribution form with the following exceptions: DU2.ASM, 
LRUNZ.ASM, and HELP2.ASM employ Z80 code as well, and have been 
converted to 8080 instructions exclusively resulting in
DU2-8080.ASM, LRUN8080.ASM, and HELP8080.ASM. I would appre-
ciate receiving reports of any other ZCPR2 utilities that do 
not operate properly in the 8080 environment.

Caveat: One of Richard's reasons for coding ZCPR2 in Z80 
instruction code is due to the limitation of the CCP to 800h
bytes in length. Needless to say, conversions of all relative
to absolute jumps and other necessary conversion resulted in a 
swollen CCP. Fortunately, several of the features Rick intro- 
duced in ZCPR2 allow a reduction in code size. My ZCPRHDR.LIB 
customization includes an external CCP stack and FCB as well as 
enabling the multiple command line feature. Each of these 
features results in a substantial space savings in the CCP
itself by moving these buffers to protected memory. It was also 
necessary to disable SUBMIT processing; this is no real loss with 
utilities such as ZEX available. Note that ZCPR2 will generate an 
error message if the 2K restriction is violated.

Please send bug reports, suggestions, etc. to me on CP-MIG, the 
CP/M interest group on Compuserve at PPN [70210,104], to the 
ARPAnet (CSTROM at MIT-MC), or through Keith Petersen's Royal Oak 
RCPM.
