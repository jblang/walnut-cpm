             1.   Foreword  One misconception which many people who first 
        see the ZCPR2 system have is that the programs which are provided 
        with ZCPR2 will run only under ZCPR2.  In many instances, this is 
        not the case.   All of the ZCPR2 utilities can be installed,  via 
        the ZCPR2 utility called GENINS (GENINS can even install itself), 
        and  one way to install these utilities is to ignore all  of  the 
        ZCPR2 special features.   By so installing them, these utilities, 
        in many cases, will run under CP/M 2.2 (unmodified) and CP/M Plus 
        without  any further alteration.   All such utilities are in  the 
        public domain,  so they may be used freely by everyone,  even the 
        non-ZCPR2 community.

             3.  Notes on the ZCPR2 Utilities

                  A.  Most ZCPR2 utilities have built-in documentation so 
        that the user can ask them what the syntax of their command lines 
        is

                  B.   ALL  ZCPR2 utilities have things such as  internal 
        paths  which enable some ZCPR2 features to be realized on  simple 
        CP/M systems without any modification to the system itself

                  C.   Most  ZCPR2  utilities offer advantages  over  the 
        conventional  counterparts available;  for example,  ERASE erases 
        R/O files (with prompting), has an inspect mode (so that the user 
        can  say Y or N to each file  selected  independently),  built-in 
        help, and file lists as arguments (ie, ERASE F1,F2,F3,...)
