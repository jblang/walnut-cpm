HOW TO USE MEX TO CONNECT TWO PHONES 
TO COMMUNICATE BY COMPUTERS 
OR TO TRANSFER PROGRAMS

1) One party calls the other on the voice line.
2) Both turn on modems and go into mex.
3) Go into terminal mode.
4) One end types ATA in terminal mode.
5) The other end types ATD in terminal mode.
6) The computes CONNECT.
7) Once connected, leave terminal mode for Mex prompt.
8) Send via the Xmodem formula, i.e.:
	S Filname.ext
	or
	SK Filname.ext
(The first is for single record transfer, the other for 1K transfer).
