3) Precepts

<filespec>     =    [<d><u>:][<filename>][.<ext>]
<string>       =    must be surrounded by quotes ('"')
                    caret ('^') prefixes a control char
'*'            =    optional prefix to primary options
';'            =    multiple command separator (see STAT ESC)

/R    specifies a newline (Carriage return code only; same as ^M)
/N    specifies carriage-return+linefeed
/T    specifies a tab
//    specifies the '/' character
/Onnn specifies any binary value (except 0): nnn is the decimal 
      value (all three digits must be present)

4) Terminal mode

<ESC>-E         exits back to command level
<ESC>-?         prints a menu of escape sequences
<ESC>-S         start copying incoming text into file buffer
<ESC>-U         end (un-start) copying text into file buffer
<ESC>-P         toggle copy-to-printer on/off
<ESC>-T         transmit a file to the remote 
                (prompts for a filename)
