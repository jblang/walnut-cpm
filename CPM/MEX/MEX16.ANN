			      MexPlus Version 1.6

NightOwl Software, Inc. is pleased to announce the commercial release of ver-
sion 1.6 of the MEX (Modem EXecutive) communications software package. With
our new enhancements, we think you'll agree that there is no more powerful
communications package for CP/M at any price! (note that features marked with
an asterisk are available only in Commercial MEX):

* o Kermit protocol (including commands to  work with a remote Kermit server).

* o YMODEM protocol support ... an emerging standard, YMODEM adds greater
    reliability and better speed to the industry-standard XMODEM protocol.
    With YMODEM, MEX maintains time-remaining on INCOMING files transferred
    from KMD or another copy of MexPlus running YMODEM.

  o We still support XMODEM/CRC and XMODEM/CHECKSUM (as always), along with
    MODEM7-compatible batch-transfer mode, and the new large (1K) packet
    options.

* o  Terminal emulation for the following terminals (MexPack versions):

		- Lear Siegler ADM3A
		- DEC VT-52 and VT-100
		- Data General Dasher D100 and D200
		- Televideo 912, 920 and 925

  o ASCII-capture in memory

* o VIEW command, to examine ASCII text captured in memory

* o REMOTE module (MEXPACK only) lets you access your computer from a remote
    location under password control.

* o In addition to the Compuserve "A" protocol we've always supported, MEX now
    includes the HOST end of the "A" protocol (i.e., the Compuserve end), when
    used with the REMOTE module.

* o Greatly expanded file transfer screens, detailing #kbytes transfered, per-
    cent transfered, time remaining, and full error and status reporting.

  o Online help system documents the entire operation of the program

* o INSTALL utility greatly simplifies MEX installation ... menu-driven sel-
    ection from over 80 different terminals, 12 real-time clocks, and over
    two dozen different computers and serial boards (all MEX1 overlays are
    still compatible with MexPlus; if you have your own MEX1 implementation,
    it will run under MexPlus without change).	Sample source code for cus-
    tom implementations available with your order, upon request.

* o Real-time clock support for "time-stamping" terminal files as well as
    "wait-for-date/wait-for time" functions.

  o Intelligent keystrings for transmitting commonly-used "chunks" of text
    to the remote

* o Intelligent keystrings may also hold MEX command lines, for use at MEX
    command level.

  o The most complete script programming language available in ANY comm-
    unications program, including:

*   - GOTO and LABEL functions for conditional control

*   - single line ("simple") IF, multi-line structured IF/ENDIF/ELSE

*   - BASIC-like GOSUB function

*   - 26 numeric variables with full-function expression evaluator

*   - 6 string variables with string-comparison operators

*   - DBASE-like "@x,y say" functions simplify writing interactive scripts

*   - Box and horizontal/vertical line-drawing functions built-in.  Supports
      line drawing character sets available in many terminals (uses ASCII
      character equivalents for those terminals without line drawing sets).

*   - Scripts may call other scripts as subroutines

*   - Basic-like variable assignments (e.g., A="Enter a number:")

*   - ACCEPT and INPUT statements read input interactively from the console

*   - WAIT STRING waits for any of up to 4 different 16-character strings
      from the modem, and lets you test which (if any) have been received

*   - WAIT DATE and WAIT TIME for delayed execution

*   - WAIT SILENCE "skips over" continuous output from the line, optionally
      copying all incoming text to a disk file.

    - SENDOUT command for sending text strings to the remote (may optionally
      be set up for "echo-check and retry", for high-reliability operation).

    - "INIT" file may be configured to automatically execute at startup

*   - "EXIT" file may be configured to automatically execute at completion

*   - GLOBAL script file (lets you specify a "lowest-level" script, which
      may completely re-define the user interface)

*   - Support for terminal attributes (reverse video, bright/dim, blink and
      underline) from the script level makes your script screens stand out!

*   - Screen ON/OFF statement for keeping the screen quiet while the script
      does its "hidden" work.

*   - Success-completion testable from within a script for SENDOUT ... list
      dialing command tells you *which* number answered.  MODEM/MODEM7/YMODEM
      transfers can be tested for successful transfers from within a script.

  o Any number of disk-based phone directories, each of which may contain
    30 entries (including a 12-character name and 50-character combined
    number and comment field.  And the remote site's baudrate, as well!).

  o Auto-dialing and redialing.  Lists of numbers may be scheduled for
    dialing, each dialed in turn until one number answers (the entire list
    may be dialed any number of times).

* o Interdigit-delay adjustment lets you configure for slow exchanges;
    you can also specify tone, pulse, or mixed.

* o Command-level TRANSMIT function sends ASCII text files (mail messages,
    remote commands, etc).

  o Special support for Alternate Long Distance services (MCI, Sprint, etc.)

  o Half-duplex and "host" terminal mode support (sometimes called remote
    and local echo, respectively).

  o XLINE ASCII exchange protocol

  o STAT command displays (and optionally alters) more than 50 different sys-
    tem variables

* o STAT display screen may be customized with the STAT DISP command.

  o CLONE command lets you resave MEX to disk (in a filename of your choice)
    for later re-execution, with all the "current" settings (including key-
    strings and phone numbers) intact.

     ------------------------------------------------------------

MEX is easy to learn ... if you've used the public domain MODEM7 or IMP
programs, you can begin using MEX immediately, with almost no relearning
required.  That's because the "lowest-level" command operation is identical
to MODEM7!  As you progress with the program, you can learn the more ad-
vanced features using the online HELP system.

     ------------------------------------------------------------

MexPlus is available in two versions: "basic" MEX ($49.95 on double-sided disk-
ette, $54.95 on single-side or 8") and the MexPack ($89.95).  MexPack includes
the terminal emulations, remote operation module, and the Compuserve "host"
protocol.

MexPlus is shipped with an ALL-NEW 70-page manual, on disk in WordStar (tm)
format, ready for your printer.
