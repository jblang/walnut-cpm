                 Copyright 1986 by Steve Sanders

{This  is the second in a three-part series of articles aimed  at 
the new owner of an IBM-PC or clone.   This month we look at some 
of DOS' hidden features and some super FREEWARE programs.}


                  -={ DOS Tip of the Month }=-

This is simple fix that will really speed things up especially if 
you have a fixed (hard) drive.  DOS allows you to allocate buffer 
space for the handling of diskfile I/O and all you need do is add 
a line to your CONFIG.SYS file as follows:

BUFFERS = 20

I would also recommend that you add the following line as well.

FILES = 20

Users  with  floppy-based  systems will probably not  notice  any 
great improvements but it sure makes a big difference with a hard 
disk drive installed.


                   -={ Change Your Prompt }=-

How would like a fancier looking DOS prompt?   It's real easy  to 
change the information displayed on your system prompt.   Instead 
of  a plain looking "A>" prompt you can have one that looks  like 
this:
        [12:27 Mon  3-03] C:\WORDPRO>

You  can  experiment  with the command prompt by  using  the  DOS 
command "PROMPT", the above is created with:

PROMPT [$T$H$H$H$H$H$H $D$H$H$H$H$H] $P$G

$T by itself displays the entire time string "00:00:00.0"
$D by itself displays the entire date string "Mon 3-03-1986"
The  $H  characters indicate how many data positions  to  display 
from the string.

You  can add this line to your AUTOEXEC.BAT file and your  prompt 
will  come  up in any fashion you desire each time the system  is 
booted.

The addition of the current sub-dir on the prompt can really save 
you a lot of time instead of doing DIRs to see what directory you 
are logged into.

Note:   You must use the MD (make dir) command and name a sub-dir 
before it can be displayed on the prompt with the "$P" parameter.  

                    -={ CED To The Rescue }=-

Ever  wish that you could just type "ERA filename" under DOS  2.x 
instead of having to enter ERASE all the time?   Or let's say you 
let someone operate your PC to play games and you don't want them 
erasing  or changing filenames,  how do you turn off the built-in 
commands?

If  this  was CP/M we were talking about I'd say  you  needed  to 
install  ZCPR3  --  but this is DOS!   Cheer up  sportsfans,  the 
answer  to most all of your problems can be had by using a  nifty 
little  program called CED.   CED stands for Command  EDitor  and 
that's  just  what  it lets you do plus a whole  bunch  of  other 
really neat little tricks.   CED is a blending of two other great 
DOS utilities, DOSEDIT and RE-CALL, and takes their best and adds 
a few new features of its own.

CED  will  actually  remember  every  command  entered  from  the 
keyboard and keeps these in a "stack" in memory for later re-call 
and subsequent editing before use.   The commands may be recalled 
by  pressing the UP arrow key or DOWN arrow key to go through the 
stack  either backwards or forwards.   Each command is  displayed 
right  on the DOS prompt line and you may use the cursor keys  to 
move  through the commandline for editing or just simply hit  the 
ENTER  key to re-use the command.   CED only  remembers  commands 
with three or more characters so repetitive commands like "D" for 
directory or "A:" are not added to the stack.

CED  also  allows you to add the convenience of synonym  commands 
which any good ZCPR3 user knows as an alias.  An alias or synonym 
is  usually  a simple command for a very  complex  or  repetitive 
operation.  It may also be used to shorten or abreviate DOS's own 
internal command names.   As I mentioned at the beginning of this 
article  it  would  be nice to say ERA instead of ERASE  all  the 
time.  No problem, just enter the following command:

CED SYN ERA ERASE

Your PC will now erase a file with entry of either "ERA filename" 
or "ERASE filename" now.  And when the kids are playing games and 
you want to turn off erase altogether, just enter:

CED IGNORE ERASE
CED IGNORE DEL

CED  actually scans every commandline entered from  the  keyboard 
and  looks  for  synonyms or commands that should be  ignored  or 
handles them accordingly.

Installation  of  CED is done at startup time by adding a  simple 
line to your AUTOEXEC.BAT file like so:   CED <-f ced.cfg>

You  can  also  load CED definitions with  the  addition  of  the 
optional <-f filename> parameter or just "CED" by itself installs 
CED for later programming from the keyboard or another .BAT file.  
CED  increases resident DOS size by about 16k and it's 5 internal 
buffers  may  also  be changed to different  sizes  but  only  at 
initial startup.

This  should have been more than enough to wet your  appetite  so 
I'll  just  say that CED is available online in the  NEWDOS  file 
area  and  can be found in a file called  CED10D.LBR,  yes,  it's 
public  domain!   And  it  has more features than  just  the  few 
mentioned here.

                  -=={ Add a Virtual Drive }==-

RAMDISK.SYS  is  a DOS 2.x device driver which is configured  and 
loaded  at  startup  time with other DOS drivers  listed  in  the 
CONFIG.SYS file.  DOS always looks for CONFIG.SYS at boot-up even 
before it starts executing commands from AUTOEXEC.BAT.  If you're 
not using a CONFIG.SYS file now it is easily created by any  text 
editor or even the COPY command.  It is just like a .BAT file and 
contains  instructions  that  are  passed to  DOS  to  allow  the 
installation of special devices.

The  RAMDISK.LBR contains the driver RAMDISK.SYS which is  placed 
on your boot disk in drive A, then add the following line to your 
CONFIG.SYS file:

DEVICE=RAMDISK.SYS <size>

The <size> parameter can be whatever amount of memory you have or 
wish to allocate to the virtual drive.   I have a 640k clone so I 
use 150k for my new drive C by giving the command:

DEVICE=RAMDISK.SYS 150

You have never seen Wordstar run so fast as it does when you copy 
Wordstar  and it's overlay files to the ram drive.   And you  can 
copy  any other frequently used utilities to drive C and then set 
the  path to check for them on C:\  This virtual drive will  also 
save  your floppy drives from a lot of unecessary wear  and  tear 
with constant drive acesses.

PC-DOS 3.1 users get a Ramdisk driver with their operating system 
utilities,  it's called VDISK.SYS and must be configured for your 
particular parameters and then used just like RAMDISK.SYS.


                    -={ BACKSCRL Utility }=-

The  library  BACKSCRL.LBR  contains a handy  DOS  extension  for 
remembering previous CRT screens.  You can take a snapshot of the 
current screen and re-call it anytime you want,  then restore the 
original  screen  again.   BACKSCRL can be set to buffer 1 to  28 
pages  depending on how much memory you want to allocate to  it's 
use.   Do  a DIR once and save your disk drive,  want to  see  it 
again, simple, just activate BACKSCRL and view it.

                -=={ Where's My Overlays ?? }==-

GLOBAL  is another DOS 2.x goodie that allows you to set  file(s) 
"common"  to  any  directory  you desire.   There are  a  lot  of 
specific  commands necessary to use GLOBAL and I'm not  going  to 
describe  them here,  the DOC file does a much better job anyway.  
Suffice  it to say that if you have a fixed (hard) disk or use  a 
Ramdisk  (virtual) drive that you should be  using  GLOBAL.   You 
just  create a WORDPRO directory for example,  then set  Wordstar 
and it's overlays comman to that directory and away you go!

Note:   GLOBAL  does not work under PC-DOS 3.x and I've had to go 
to  a commercial alternative called SmartPath(tm) which does  the 
same extra path searching for overlays.

                  -=={ Prevent CRT Burn-In }==-

BURNOUT.LBR  has  a DOS device called BURNDEV.SYS which  is  also 
loaded via the CONFIG.SYS file at startup.   This one will darken 
your  CRT display after 8 to 10 minutes of no keyboard  activity.  
You  just  tap any key and your screen is instantly restored  and 
ready to go again.  

For  those of you who have their computers in a semi-public  area 
and  wish  to  add password protection as  well  as  CRT  burn-in 
protection,  check out the D.LBR files.  D.EXE when executed will 
black  out  the CRT until any key is pressed,  it  then  responds 
with:

ACF82004 ACF2, ENTER PASSWORD-

and  waits for the correct password to be entered or justs blacks 
out the screen again if an iccorect password is  entered.   After 
entry  of the proper password,  the screen is once again restored 
with  all the data as it was before typed  "D".   The  characters 
preceding  the "ENTER PASSWORD-" prompt are meant to mystify  the 
curious  according  to  the author and  simulate  some  mainframe 
terminal  ID  sequence  or  some  such  nonsense.   The  internal 
password is easily changed (if you know the current password) and 
this program provides "simple" protection unless the  mischievous 
hacker has brought along his own boot disk.

                        -={ PCWINDOW }=-

Want  a SideKick-type program but don't want to spend any  money?  
The PCWNDW22.LBR has a memory-resident program with the following 
features: Time/date display with stopwatch timer, ASCII character 
table, Note pad, and Printer Set-Up utility.  

All   of  these  are  displayed  in  pop-up  windows  just   like 
SideKick's.   Press  ALT-0 and a main menu appears in  the  upper 
righthand  corner  of  the  screen,  press  ALT-0  again  and  it 
dissapears again.

{End of Part 2, next month we look at hardware goodies.}


                 -={ TBKUG ZCPR3 User Disks }=-

The  TBKUG has the entire phase 1 and 2 release files for Richard 
Conn's  Z-80 Console Processor Replacement version 3.00  and  the

supply  these disks in most any 5-1/4"  soft-sector  format,  but 
inquire  first.   Be sure to include the return postage or you'll 
get  a nasty note from me,  I spend enough money now as it is  at 
the local Post Office.


                     -={ NEW CP/M FILES }=-

PROLINK.LBR  is Ron Fowler's (of MEX fame) fancy  linkage  editor 
for  .REL  files.   This  was previously a  NightOwl  proprietary 
program  but  Ron  has now graciously donated it  to  the  public 
domain for all to use.   PROLINK works great in conjunction  with 
output  files  from ZASM,  a macro-assembler also in  the  public 
domain.   Put  these  two fine programs together and you  have  a 
system as good as the commercial M80/L80 package from MicroSoft.

NULUFIX.ASM   A fix has been found for NULU v1.5.   Like all good 
fixes,  however, it causes its own share of problems and can only 
stand  as a temporary fix until I can get version 1.6  out.   The 
problem was BDOS function 37, which NULU15 uses before writing to 
a   drive   in  case  it  has  been   changed.    Under   certain 
circumstances,  BDOS loses its mind when this function is  called 
and starts giving away previously allocated disk blocks.  This is 
no good for anyone.	The "solution" lies in NOT USING BDOS 37.  
The  problem  now  is that you cannot tell NULU to log in  a  new 
disk.   Oh well,  try to live with it until I get the new one out 
that will support the fix. {text extracted from NULUFIX.ASM}

I/OCAPKP.LBR will allow you to capture console output and send it 
to a diskfile for later editing and/or viewing.  This version has 
been  tested on my Kaypro 10 with TurboROM,  ZCPR3,  and half the 
kitchen sink running in memory and it still works!   You just run 
the program to install it in memory and everything printed on the 
screen  is  saved to a diskfile.   Run the program again  and  it 
turns it off.

USQFST18.LBR  This is the fastest CP/M file unsqueezer I've  ever 
used.  Compared to Dave Rand's USQ120 written in machine language 
it's about 2 to 3 times faster!   Many improvements have appeared 
in this program since it's release and it keeps getting better.

SB-180  owners  will want to look at CONFIG12.LBR and  FVC22.LBR.  
The  CONFIG12  files  allow you to re-configure  your  system  in 
memory or on disk.   The original CONFIG has some problems and is 
outlined  in  the  CONFIG.BUG file  also  online.   FVC22  is  an 
improved  disk format/verify/copy program.   All  SB-180  related 
files can now be found in their own file area called SB180.

RESQ14.LBR  is the latest ram-text restoring program for Wordstar 
users.   If you ever get a diskfull error while trying to save an 
edited file,  press the reset button, insert a disk with RESQ.COM 
on  it and simply enter "RESQ".   RESQ will ask for a  string  to 
search for and then hunts thru the ram buffer until it's located, 
then  backs up to the start of the buffer and saves it to the end 
of  the  text area.   You end up with a file called  RES.Q  which 
contains the "lost" text, or at least 14-16k of it anyway.

DIR1ST30.LBR is a unique type of directory program,  it lists the 
filenames  and sizes in 'k' as usual,  but it also can be told to 
display the first <nn> lines of ASCII printable files.

                    -={ MexPlus for CP/M }=-

The  DataCOM Super Systems(tm) was chosen as one of  the  primary 
download   sites   for  Ron  Fowler's  new  MexPlus  v1.6   modem 
communications program for CP/M systems.  If you have enjoyed the 
public  domain version of MEX114 and would like to have  an  even 
more  sophisticated  program  then  you  want  MexPlus.   MexPlus 
features  full support of real-time clocks which adds a bunch  of 
new  STAT and WAIT variables for timing purposes.   Or how  about 
the  MexPack  with  either  the REMOTE  option  or  the  Terminal 
Emulator option, or both.

Current pricing for MexPlus downloads is as follows:

Basic  MexPlus  package including Wordstar formatted  manual  and 
complete menu-driven installation program is    $59.95

MexPlus with REO or TEM options                 $89.95

MexPlus with both REO and TEM options           $99.90

REO  is the remote control package for MexPlus,  you can call  in 
from  another  computer and have full remote control of  MexPlus.  
This access can be secured by using the password option so  don't 
fear the zit-faced Twits.

The  TEM or Terminal Emulator can easily configure your  computer 
to  look and act like quite a few others.   VT-52/100 is used  by 
many  mainframe  computers  and there are many more  like  ADM3A, 
TV920/950, Hazletine 1500, and so on.

See  the  file called MEXPLUS.NQW on the remote systems for  full 
details of all of MexPlus' features, there just isn't enough room 
here  to  do  it justice.   Suffice it to say that  if  you  were 
impressed  with the pd version of MEX,  just wait until  you  try 
MexPlus!

                     How to Download MexPlus

You  must pay in advance by check or money order made payable  to 
TBKUG in the amount shown above for the desired package.  Special 
arrangements  will be made in advance and the MexPlus files  will 
be made available to you to download via modem.


Credit card orders and persons wishing to buy the IBM-PC  version 
of MEX-PC must contact NightOwl Software direct at:

                          1-800-NITEOWL

The  PC version comes only with a nice printed manual in a  vinyl 
binder  and  is  not available on diskfile so  it  precludes  its 
download-ability sorry.

The  board is intended for use by our customers and those who are 
interested in NEC Home Electronics Computers and Software.   This 
is  currently  an open board,  meaning,  passwords are  not  pre-
assigned...  a caller makes one up upon logging in for the  first

loading section is not restricted, so even first time callers may 
use it.  The Christensen 128 byte packet protocol is currently in 
use  for up/downloads,  so a caller wishing to upload must have a 
MODEM7, MEX, or compatible program in order to up/download.

Beginners  are welcome and are encouraged to read and re-read the 
many help explanations that are available on this board,  and  to 
generally play around to get the feel of things.  Some good books 
on Public Domain Bulletin Boards are available,  which are highly 
helpful  in learning about this and other systems like  it.   The 
main intent of this Remote Bulletin Board System is to aid in the

               -={ N.A.O.G. Becomes NAOG/ZSIG }=-

Now that the membership of the North American One-Eighty Group is  
solidly  into  triple  figures,  an important fact  has  emerged:  
people  who don't own SB180s (or any other HD64180-based  system)  
are a big part ( a near-majority!) of NAOG.   Furthermore,  there 
is   no   independent  national  or  international  users   group 
dedicated  to  advanced CP/M-compatible computing.  Most existing 
groups,   SIG/M,   CPMUG,  FOG,  KUG,  CP-MIG,  etc.,  have  vast 
memberships and software  libraries,  but have failed to do  what 
needs  to  be  done to assure  the survival and growth  of  8-bit 
computing:  get behind the new  operating system standard, ZCPR3, 
and the many possible performance enhancements and user  benefits 
it affords. 

Echelon,  Inc.  has done a thoroughly admirable job of  promoting 
and supporting ZCPR3 (and the fine-but-optional ZRDOS), but it is 
apparent  that no software company can provide the support on the 
individual  user  level that a united user  community  can  give.  
Moreover, Echelon's major efforts, for economic reasons, must now 
focus  on  landing  OEM agreements if they  are  to  survive  and 
prosper  - we  want them to do just that.   Frank   Gaude',  Rick 
Conn,  Dennis Wright and Dave McCord are exceptionally energetic, 
innovative people,  but they are not supermen.  It is not fair to 
expect the impossible from them. Yet, many do expect just exactly 
that,  and  complain that most of the fine (and not-so-fine)  new 
programs coming out of the user community are not being  reviewed 
for  inclusion  into  the official Z tool set.

We  propose  an  alternative place for ZCPR3 innovators  to  take 
their  wares and for advanced users to share  their  discoveries.  
Effective immediately,  N.A.O.G. is now NAOG/ZSIG - ZSIG for ZCPR 
Systems  Interest Group.   We have not forgotten the SB180  owner 
and the HD64180 enthusiast - THE ONE-EIGHTY FILE will provide the 
support  and exchange of ideas that NAOGers have already come  to 
expect.   We  believe  that advanced software deserves  the  best 
available hardware - and,  for now,  that is the 64180.	  We have 
simply remembered everyone else.   We believe a solid Z80 machine 
running  ZCPR3 is better than an IBM clone for most purposes.  We 
don't   want  to  see  all  that  sound  hardware  junked   - and 
programming  expertise wasted - in a rush toward   IBM-compatible 
mediocrity.  We support a viable alternate path to computer-aided 
human productivity and creativity. 

                      NAOG/ZSIG And Echelon

We  will build a Public Domain library of alternative  tools  and 
true ZCPR3 applications written by users.  We do this in the same 
spirit  as  a previous era's CP/M users expanded on what  Digital 
Research provided, creating - as Rick Conn acknowledges in source 
code  comments - the basis for  much of  the  ZCPR3  system.   We 
receive  the ZCPR3 system with gratitude.   We propose to use its 
amazing flexibilty in new and innovative ways for the benefit  of 
all.

                     NAOG/ZSIG - Who We Are

The  core  group  of NAOG/ZSIG consists  of:

Jay Sage - Software Librarian
Richard Jacobson - Remote Access Systems (RAS) Coordinator 
Bruce Morgen - Director and ONE-EIGHTY FILE editor   

Jay Sage will take on the task (with whomever he recruits to help 
him)  of  reviewing  new software and  organizing  it  into  ZSIG 
libraries.  

Richard  Jacobson's beautifully maintained Lillipute Z-Nodes will 
be  the official software collection and distribution  points  as 
well  as  the  NAOG/ZSIG maildrop - he will also see  that  other 
sysops, Z-Noders or not, are kept up to date.  

			   Joining Up

Membership is open to all.   Send $15 U.S. ($25 payable on a U.S. 
bank  if  you are beyond the reach of a 22 cent  stamp)  and  the 
NAOG/ZSIG  Membership Application form below (let us know if  you 
want to be accessible to other NAOG/ZSIGers, please!) to:

NAOG/ZSIG
P.O. Box 2871			   Phone: 215-443-9031
Warminster, PA	18974		   (Voice - data by appt.)

Library  disk  distribution will commence as soon as 180K  or  so 
(source and object) are accumulated.  To accommodate the greatest 
number  of users,  the Ampro,  Kaypro and Osborne SSDD 5.25  inch 
disk formats will be supported,  with others to follow if  demand  
warrants.   Unlike NAOG userdisks(tm), the ZSIG libraries will be  
available to non-members for a small additional charge: NAOG/ZSIG 
members get them for $12  postpaid,  non-members pay $18 ($18 and  
$25  are  charged  for overseas destinations).   Members  get  12 
monthly ONE-EIGHTY FILEs and access to the NAOG/ZSIG  directories 
of  the  Lillipute  Z-Nodes.   Full Lillipute  Z-Node  access  is 
offered at $35/year, representing a $5 discount, to NAOG/ZSIGers. 

If  you want to drop us E-Mail you can call Lillipute  Z-Node  at 
312-649-1730  or  312-664-1730 (300/1200/2400 baud) and  leave  a 
message for SYSOP, Jay Sage, or Bruce Morgen (note spelling). Jay 
can  be  reached directly via his own Z-Node #3  at  617-765-7259 
(300/1200/2400   baud)  and  Bruce  Morgen's  GEnie  address   is 
BRUCEMORGEN.

Well, that wraps up another month of news and reviews.  Lots more 
good stuff coming next month, until then... adios.
