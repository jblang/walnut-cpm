          Program:  DIRLBL.RSX
          Products and Serial Numbers Affected:  CP/M Plus.. V3.0  2-000-00001
          through 2-000-xxxxx

          Error Description:

          In some circumstances, DIRLBL destroys critical addresses at the end
          of the file descriptor area.  It also does not allocate enough local
          stack for some BIOS implementations.  Both situations  result  in  a
          hung system.

          Patch Procedure:

          Make a back-up copy of DIRLBL.RSX before making  any  changes.   Use
          SID.. to patch DIRLBL.RSX with the following series of commands:

               A>ren dirlbl.sav=drlbl.rsx
