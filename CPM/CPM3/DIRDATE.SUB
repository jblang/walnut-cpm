;Patch to standard CP/M Plus DIR.COM to show datestamps in international
;DD/MM/YY format.
;
;Assuming you haven't renamed the standard DIR.COM to something else,
;just say SUBMIT DIRDATE DIR to install the patch.  If you have renamed
;DIR.COM then give the new name.  Mine is called XD.COM so the command I'd
;use is SUBMIT DIRDATE XD
