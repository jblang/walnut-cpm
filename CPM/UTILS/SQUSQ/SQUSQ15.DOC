Re:   New SQ USQ and FLS

Greenlaw's latest SQUEEZER programs are FLS-11, USQ-15
and SQ-15.  The main change is to SQ, which turned out
to have a bug in it--in previous versions, an occasional
combination of characters would cause it to try to generate
code longer than 16 bits, which made the files involved
non-unsqueezable.  Steve Bogolub here in Chicago discovered
the bug, sent files that proved its existence to Richard
Greenlaw, and got a disk with a debugged SQ last week.  It
now checks to see whether a >16 bit code is being generated
and if so prints "rescaling" and goes around again to gene-
rate a safer table.
