Major changes to the file compression package:

8/29/81
A BUG was found in the SQ program which caused incorrect
squeezing of files with certain frequency distributions of
characters. SQ 1.5 fixes that problem. See change notes in SQ.C.
USQ DID catch the failure by its CRC check, but that's too late.

8/02/81
USQ.C, SQ.C IO.C and SQUEEZER.DOC affected by cosmetic run-time
output changes and change to formfeed during previewing.

7/18/81
A  comprehensive documentation file,  SQUEEZER.DOC has  been 
added. It replaces some previously scattered information.

7/03/81
USQ version 1.4 has a new feature to allow previewing squeezed
files without bothering to create unsqueezed files. It can also
limit the output from each file to a specified number of lines.
Since the output can be redirected you can capture in a single
file the preliminary comments from each of a group of files.

6/16/81
The first version of USQ forgot to close input files and
sometimes exceeded the limit of open files in the BDS C
run time package.

Both USQ and SQ were changed so that both normal and error
exits would close their files properly. This error arose
because the original versions only handled one file and
relied on the automatic closing at program exit.

I also noted some weird situations when using a pipe to connect
FLS to USQ or SQ. Sometimes the latter reported a different
list of files than was requested! The problem occurs when a
program is aborted leaving a pipe input file (TEMPIN.$$$) on
the current diskette. The next run creates its TEMPIN.$$$ by
renaming another file. You can end up with both TEMPIN.$$$
files on the same diskette!!! The old one appears earlier in
the directory, so it is used instead of the new one.

The DIO package which forms DIO2.C, SQDIO.C and USQDIO.C has
been changed to always erase TEMPIN.$$$ as a program exits,
even though that program didn't create it.
