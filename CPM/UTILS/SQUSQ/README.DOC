Many  of  the  files  on this tape  or  diskette  have  been 
squeezed  by the data compression program SQ.COM.  Names  of 
squeezed files have Q as the second letter of the file type. 
These files can be unsqueezed individually by USQ.COM.

The  file SQUEEZER.DOC (SQUEEZER.DQC if squeezed) contains a 
complete tutorial on the use of these programs. It will tell 
you how to unsqueeze a whole diskette with one command,  and 
much more, including which files combine to produce each .COM.

None of this requires extra disk drives except to get enough 
space.  Allow  about  half again the space occupied  by  the 
squeezed files, which will not be disturbed.

For example,
     A>usq b: c:squeezer.dqc
will create on drive B the abovementioned file  SQUEEZER.DOC 
if the squeezed version, SQUEEZER.DQC is on drive C.

If you just want to look at the first few lines, try:
     A>usq -14 c:squeezer.dqc
