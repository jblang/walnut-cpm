To put the file back together, use PIP: 

	>PIP newfile.dat=file.001,file.002, ...

	**** NOTE - If the split file is binary, e.g, .COM, .OVR,
	SQueezed or CRUNCHed, you must tell PIP to ignore imbedded
	ASCII end-of-file markers  - ^Z (1A hex) -  for each section.
	For example, if the file SD.COM were split into three sections
	the syntax would be:

	>PIP sd.com=sd.001[OV],sd.002[OV],sd.003[OV]

	If you omit those '[O]'s the output file will almost certainly
	be pure garbage.  The 'V' verifies the transfer and could be
	optional.

This concatenates the pieces back into a single file.
