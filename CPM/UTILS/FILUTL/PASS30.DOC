
PASS version 3.0 is NOT an assembled version of PST's PASS.COM for ZCPR.
Instead, this is a novel little program that will install a password into
any COM file.  The best way to explain is to give an example:

        A>DIR                                   <- the two files are on the dsk
        PASS30  .COM  |  STAT    .COM
        A>STAT                                  <- the original file is run
        A: R/W 38k free
        A>PASS30 STAT.COM                       <- PASS30 is invoked
        Password? FREEDOM                       <- the PW is now set
        A>STAT                                  <- someone tries to run it
        Password? BARF                          <- oops, wrong pw, so warmboot
        A>
        A>STAT                                  <- let's try again
        Password? FREEDOM                       <- proper pw entered, so run
        A: R/W 38k free                            the program
        A>

P.S. The author is unknown, whoever you are, kindly step foward.

P.P.S.  DO NOT run PASS30 over a program twice! then you will need to
        enter TWO passwords (it has no way of "clearing" the pw, so
        once it's set, it's locked in there.)
