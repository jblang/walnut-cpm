                          INTRODUCTION

NULU  is  offered  as a complete replacement for LU  and  LSWEEP.  
Weighing  in  at 14k,  it includes nearly all  features  of  both 
programs and then some.  It features:

	Two operation modes with a full menu for each
	Viewing  and printing of member files,  unsqueezing  when
                necessary
	Extraction of member files with an option to unsqueeze
                where appropriate
	Bigger libraries, up to 800 members or more depending on
                available memory
	Automatic member sorting, all members kept sorted at all
                times
	Faster reorganization
	Enhanced error handling
	Access to deleted members
	Optional read only mode
	General compatibility with LU and NSWEEP syntax


                 DIFFERENCES BETWEEN NULU AND LU

I  am aware of only one thing that LU does that NULU does not do.  
LU  maintains  a  CRC for each member file and  for  the  library 
directory  as a whole.   NULU doesn't do this at all.   In  fact, 
NULU changes these CRC bytes to 00 as soon as it gets the chance.  
In case you still want or need to run LU on a library modified by 
NULU, LU will simply regard it as a library created by an earlier  
LU version and will promptly set CRC's for the various members.



:F
                  AN ASIDE CONCERNING FILESPECS

When  specifying  a  filespec,  wildcards  may  be  used  freely, 
however,  unlike  most programs,  NULU doesn't insist that a  "." 
separate  the  filename  from the  filetype.   For  example,  the 
filespec  "**"  means the same thing as "*.*" to  NULU.   On  the 
other hand,  the filespec "FRED.TXT" should be typed in just like 
that.   "FREDTXT" would make NULU think that no filetype had been 
specified.   The rule is simple: use a dot any time you like, but 
it is only strictly necessary when it is needed for clarity.

When  specifying  a  drive and/or user area the  syntax  is  very 
liberal.    "A15:**"  means  the  same  as  "15/A:*.*",  as  does 
"1A5:**".   The  colon is absolutely necessary.   If a  different 
user area is desired for the default drive,  the drive  specifier 
may  be  omitted,  as in "15:**",  just as the user area  may  be 
omitted as in "A:**".



If  a  drive/user  specification  is made,  but  no  filespec  is 
indicated, a filespec of ????????.??? is generated.  Therefore to 
indicate the default drive,  current user area, and a filespec of 
????????.???, just type a colon by itself (e.g., ":") !


:1
                         NULU OPERATION

NULU  may be invoked with or without a command tail.   A  command 
tail can consist of any combination of valid NULU operators up to 
128  characters  (the limit imposed by the  CCP.   Once  NULU  is 
running, command lines can be as long as 254 characters.)

As  in LU,  all NULU commands are preceded by a dash.   This is a 
copy of the menu for the command mode of operation:

         -A Add members             -B Brief toggle
         -C Close the library       -D Delete members
         -E Extract members         -F Filesweep mode
         -G Get filespec            -K Krunch the library
         -L List members            -M Menu
         -N Rename members          -O Open a library
         -P Print members           -Q Unsqueeze members
         -R Replace members         -T Replace/Add members
         -U Drive/User change       -V View members
         -X Exit NULU               -Y Disk directory
         -< Redirect input          -> Redirect output


Commands  may  be strung together,  each terminated by  a  space.  
They  are processed left to right.   All characters are converted 
to upper case.

The  default drive/user area are displayed along with the name of 
the  current command mode each time the console is  prompted  for 
input.

The  commands  will  be explained in order  of  their  appearance 
above.    All  items  in  [square  brackets]  indicate   optional 
parameters.    Filespec   parameters  enclosed  in  (parenthesis) 
indicate references to deleted member files.   Three dots ("...") 
after a parameter indicate infinite repetition.

:2

-A       ADD MEMBERS
         Syntax: -a filespec[ filespec...]

         Use  this command to add files from disk to the  current 
         library.   NULU will make a series of passes through the 
         directory,  adding  files as it goes,  until the list of 
         matching  files  is  exhausted.   If  matching  filename 
         already exists as an active member in the  library,  its 
         name will be displayed and the file will not be added.

         In  all file addition and replacement operations,  if  a 
         deleted  entry  of identical size can be  located,  that 
         disk  space and directory entry will be used rather than 
         allocating new space for the file.   This means that  it 
         will  be  necessary  to reclaim wasted disk  space  less 
         often.



-B       BRIEF TOGGLE
         Syntax: -b

         This toggles the prompting mode.  The release version of 
         NULU is setup to print the full name of the current mode 
         for  a prompt,  as in "-ADD MEMBERS A0:>".   If BRIEF is 
         turned on the user will simply see "-A A0:>".   NULU may 
         be  permanently patched to default to BRIEF ON  or  OFF.  
         See NULU MODIFICATION.



-C       CLOSE THE LIBRARY
         Syntax: -c

         This  command  closes the current library,  writing  its 
         directory  to disk if any changes have been made to  the 
         directory.   The  library  directory  is  NEVER  written 
         except when the library is closed,  so be sure to do it.  
         If  you forget to do so and remove the disk,  NULU  will 
         prompt  you  for  the  disk again and  will  attempt  to 
         recover, but no guarantees!  

         Some  other operations that cause the current library to 
         be closed are:
               -k, -o, -x



-D       DELETE MEMBERS
         Syntax: -d filespec[ filespec (filespec)...]

         Member  files matching the given filespec will be  given 
         deleted status in the library directory, except when the 
         filespec  is  enclosed in  parenthesis.   In  that  case 
         matching  deleted  members will be given active  status.  
         That is,  they will be undeleted.   If the filename of a 
         matching deleted member file already exists as an active 
         member, the filename will be displayed and the file will 
         not be undeleted.



-E       EXTRACT MEMBERS
         Syntax: -e filespec[=newfilespec filespec...]

         Use  this  command to extract active member  files.   If 
         extraction to the current drive/user area is desired, no 
         further syntax is necessary.  To indicate another drive, 
         however,   a   destination  filespec  may  be   included 
         following an equals sign.  Example:

         -e **=a5:

         would extract all active members to drive A,  user  area 
         5.   Files  may  be  renamed as well  as  redirected  by 
         indicating  a  filespec along with,  or in place  of,  a 
         drive user specification.  Examples:



         1.  -e *asm=*bak
         2.  -e *asm=5:*txt
         3.  -e fred.txt=sam.txt jane.inf=c8:girls.dbf

         The examples would produce the following results:

         1.  Extract all files with a type of .ASM to the default 
         drive/user renaming them with the filetype of .BAK.
         2.  Extract all files of type .ASM to user area 5 of the 
         default drive, renaming each with the .BAK filetype.
         3.   Extract  the  member file FRED.TXT to  the  default 
         drive/user  under the name of SAM.TXT,  and extract  the 
         member file JANE.INF to user area 8 of drive C: with the 
         filename GIRLS.DBF.

         The  only  rule  to remember is that  if  a  destination 
         filespec is entered it cannot be any less ambiguous than 
         the  source filespec.   That is,  "*asm=*bak"  is  valid 
         while "**=*bak" is not valid.
:3

-F       FILESWEEP MODE
         Syntax: -f

         This command places NULU in its second operational mode: 
         the  filesweep  mode.   This  allows the  user  to  move 
         through  the directory of active member files as if they 
         were  individual files being examined by a program  like 
         NSWEEP.    The  filesweep  mode's  command  list  is  as 
         follows:

         A Next member              B Previous member
         C Close the library        D Delete member
         E Extract member           L Log new library
         P Print member             Q Unsqueeze member
         R Rename member            U Drive/User change
         V View member              W Wildcard rename
         X Exit NULU                Y Disk directory
         Z NULU command mode        ? Menu


         Because of the extreme similarity between these commands 
         and  the commands of NULU's command mode,  only a  short 
         description of each command will be given.

         A  --  Advance to next member
               (spacebar, cr, or lf will produce the same result)
         B  --  Back up to previous member
         C  --  Close the current library
         D  --  Delete current member file
         E  --  Extract current member file
               (prompt allows redirection)
         L  --  Logon to new library
               (closes the current library)
         P  --  Dumps the current member file to LST:
               (unsqueezes if needed)
         Q  --  Extract  current  member  file,  unsqueezing  if 
                    necessary
               (prompt allows redirection)
         R  --  Rename current member file



         U  --  Change drive/user defaults
               (returns file pointer to the top of the file list)
         V  --  View current member file
               (unsqueezes if needed)
         W  --  Wildcard rename of members
               (prompts for both oldname and newname)
         X  --  Exit NULU
               (closes all files)
         Y  --  Get disk directory for default drive/user
               (returns file pointer to the top of the file list)
         Z  --  Return to NULU command mode
               (current library remains open)
         ?  --  Print the filesweep mode menu
               (returns file pointer to the top of the file list)



         If,  when  the  filesweep mode is entered,  or  after  a 
         library  has  been  closed,   there  is  not  a  library 
         currently open, the filesweep mode will prompt with:

         No library open.

         and will accept only the following commands:

         L,U,X,Y,Z,?

         Likewise,  if a library is open but only has a directory 
         with no other active members, the message

         No member files.

         will be printed and only the commands listed above will 
         be accepted.



         During  the filesweep mode operation,  each file will be 
         listed  in  the  order  in which  it  is  found  in  the 
         directory,  along with the size in K that the file would 
         occupy if it were extracted to the default drive.

         If  the filesweep mode is terminated by a return to  the 
         NULU  command  mode,  any commands that followed the  -F 
         command  on  the  previous NULU  command  line  will  be 
         executed.

:4

-G       GET FILESPEC
         Syntax: -g filespec

         NULU  will search for the filespec indicated.   If it is 
         found,  processing  continues.   If  not,  the  user  is 
         prompted  to insert the disk containing  that  filespec.  
         The  drive is then reset and search again.   The program 
         will  prompt  forever  until  it  receives  the   proper 
         filespec or until a cntrl-c is entered,  forcing NULU to 
         continue without the filespec being found.

         This  command can be useful when attempting  to  control 
         NULU  through  a submit utility like  DRI's  SUBMIT.COM.  
         For example, one might type:

         nulu -o a:asm -g b5:-work.005 -e **=b10: -g a0:-5.005 -x



         After loading,  NULU would open a library called ASM.LBR 
         on  drive A:  in the current user area.   Next it  would 
         search  user area 5 of drive B:  for filespec  -WORK.005 
         until  it  was  found.   Then all  active  member  files 
         would  be  extracted  to  user  area  10  of  drive  B:.  
         Finally, NULU would search user area 0 of drive A: for a 
         filespec  called  -5.005 until found.  Then  NULU  would 
         terminate.  Notice here that the ASM.LBR didn't have  to 
         be  closed  before  the search for  the  final  filespec 
         because   no  change  had  been  made  to  the   library 
         directory.   If  a change had been made,  after the  new 
         filespec had been loaded,  NULU would have demanded  the 
         disk with ASM.LBR back so it could update the directory.  
         Therefore   the  GET  operation  would  be   effectively 
         negated.



-K       KRUNCH THE LIBRARY
         Syntax: -k[ <number of entries to allow]

         Even  though all members are kept in alphabetical  order 
         at all times, when a member is deleted the disk space it 
         occupies  is not released to the operating system  until 
         the KRUNCH command is executed.   KRUNCH consists of the 
         following steps:

         1.   The  library directory is re-sorted by sector index 
         number,  that is, in the order in which the member files 
         actually exist in the library.

         2.  The library is closed.



         3.   A  new library called WORKLBR.$$$ is opened in  the 
         default  drive/user  area and the user  is  prompted  to 
         input the number of files that the new library should be 
         able to contain.   If the user wants just enough entries 
         to contain the currently active members, the number 1 or 
         any  number less than or equal to the current number  of 
         active  entries  may  be  entered.    If  the   optional 
         parameter  listed above is entered,  it will be used  as 
         the  number of entries.   (The KRUNCH processed  may  be 
         aborted  here by typing RETURN or 0.   Please note  that 
         the  library  directory  counts as  an  entry  and  will 
         automatically be accounted for by NULU.)

         4.   Once WORKLBR.$$$ is opened, the active member files 
         from the original library will be copied one by one into 
         the  new  library.   The copy routine uses  a  recursive 
         process to copy as many files at one time as possible.



         5.   The  old  library  is deleted  and  WORKLBR.$$$  is 
         renamed with the old library name.

         Examples:
         1.  -k
         2.  -k <1
         3.  -u b5: -k <63
         4.  -u b5: -k <1 -u a0: -k <63

         The above example would produce the following results:

         1.   The  library  would  be  KRUNCHed  to  the  default 
         drive/user  area.   The user would be prompted to  input 
         the number of entries to allow.

         2.   The  library  would  be  KRUNCHed  to  the  default 
         drive/user  area with just enough entries to contain all 
         currently active member files.


         3.   The default drive/user area would be changed to B5: 
         before  the  KRUNCH begins.   Then the library would  be 
         KRUNCHed, allowing 63 entries.

         4.   The default drive/user area would be changed to B5: 
         before  the  KRUNCH begins.  The KRUNCH would  commence, 
         allowing  only  enough  entries to  contain  all  active 
         members.   The drive/user area would be changed to  A0:. 
         Then  the library would be KRUNCHed again,  allowing  63 
         entries.



-L       LIST MEMBERS
         Syntax: -l[ filespec]
         Syntax: -l[ (filespec)]

         Use  this  command to list the contents of  the  library 
         directory.   Each  member filename will printed followed 
         by  the starting relative sector number in  the  library 
         file, the size of the member in sectors, and the size in 
         K  that the file would occupy if it were to be extracted 
         to the default drive/user area.  Finally, a recap of the 
         size of all member files listed is printed,  along  with 
         the number of sectors occupied by deleted files.



         The  parameters listed above can be used to control  the 
         selection of files for display.  Examples:

         1.  -l
         2.  -l **
         3.  -l (**)
         4.  -l *asm
         5.  -l (fred.txt)

         The above examples would produce the following results:

         1.  All active member files listed.
         2.  All active member files listed.
         3.  All deleted member files listed.
         4.  All  active  member files  matching the filespec  of 
         ????????.ASM listed.
         5.   All  deleted member files called  FRED.TXT  listed.  
         (Note  that is IS possible to have more than one deleted 
         file with the same name.)

-M       MENU
         Syntax: -m

         Print the command mode menu.



-N       RENAME MEMBERS
         Syntax: -n oldfilespec=newfilespec[...]
         Syntax: -n (oldfilespec)=newfilespec[...]

         This  command is used to rename active or deleted member 
         files.    Wildcards   are  fully  supported,   but   the 
         newfilespec   can   be  no  less  ambiguous   than   the 
         oldfilespec.    Deleted   members  may  be  renamed   by 
         enclosing   the   oldfilespec   ONLY   in   parenthesis.  
         Examples:

         1.  -n *asm=*bak
         2.  -n (fred.txt)=sam.txt
         3.  -n **=**



         The above examples would produce the following results:

         1.    All   active   members   matching   the   filespec 
         ????????.ASM would be renamed with a filetype of .BAK.

         2.   The first deleted member file called FRED.TXT would 
         be renamed to SAM.TXT.   All other members matching that 
         filespec would be listed along with a message indicating 
         that they could not be renamed.

         3.  All active member files would be listed, each with a 
         message  indicating  that  they  could  not  be  renamed 
         because the name already exists.



-O       OPEN A LIBRARY
         Syntax: -o filename[ <number of entries to allow]

         With the exception of the filesweep Logon command,  this 
         command is the only method to open or create a  library.  
         NULU  will search for the filename indicated.   If it is 
         found, it will be opened and a message will be displayed 
         indicating the size of the Data Transfer  Buffer.   This 
         is  the number of sectors in memory that NULU will  have 
         to use in extracting, adding or copying member files.

         If the file is not found,  the user will be prompted for 
         the  number of entries to allow in the new library.   If 
         the optional parameter above is passed,  the number will 
         be used to determine the directory size of the  library.  
         All  directories can contain some multiple of 4 entries.  
         All  numbers  input will be rounded up  to  the  nearest 
         multiple  of  4.   Remember  that the  directory  itself 
         counts  as  one entry and that NULU  will  automatically 
         make space for it.


         The filename passed must be unambiguous.

         NOTE ON DIRECTORY SIZE:
         Depending on available memory, libraries with as many as 
         1250 entries (theoretically) can be opened.   But  watch 
         the  Data  Transfer Buffer Size!   If it is less than  8 
         sectors you will not be able to unsqueeze any files.



-P       PRINT MEMBERS
         Syntax: -p filespec[ filespec (filespec)...]

         With  this command,  the ascii contents of member  files 
         matching  the filespecs given will be dumped to the list 
         device.   If the file is squeezed,  NULU will  unsqueeze 
         it.   Deleted  members  may be listed by  enclosing  the 
         appropriate filespec in parenthesis.



-Q       UNSQUEEZE MEMBERS
         Syntax: -q filespec[=newfilespec filespec...]

         This command is identical in operation and syntax to the 
         EXTRACT command, except that if the matching members are 
         squeezed, they will be unsqueezed.

:6

-R       REPLACE MEMBERS
         Syntax: -r filespec[ filespec...]

         This command is identical in operation and syntax to the 
         ADD command, except that matching files will be added to 
         the  library ONLY if they already exist in the  library.  
         They will be deleted, then the new files will be added.



-T       REPLACE/ADD MEMBERS
         Syntax: -t

         This command is a combination of the ADD and the REPLACE 
         commands.   If  the  files do not exist in the  library, 
         they  will be added.   If they do exist,  they  will  be 
         replaced.



-U       DRIVE/USER CHANGE
         Syntax: -u new drive/user

         Use  this command to change the default drive/user area.  
         A colon (":") must follow the drive/user spec.  Example:

         -u a5:

         would switch the default drive/user area to A5:.



-V       VIEW MEMBERS
         Syntax: -v filespec[ filespec (filespec)...]

         This  command will list the ascii contents of all member 
         files matching the given filespec to the console device.  
         Deleted  members  may  be  indicated  by  enclosing  the 
         filespec  in  parenthesis.   If  the  member  files  are 
         squeezed,  they will be unsqueezed.   At each page, NULU 
         will accept one  of the following commands:

         1.  Cntrl-x to skip to the next member file
         2.  Cntrl-c to abort further listing
         3.  L to list one line
         4.  CR, space, or LF to list another full page



         At  the  end  of each member  file  the  message

          "Press RETURN"

         will  be  displayed and NULU will wait for  a  keystroke 
         before moving to the next matching member file.



-X       EXIT NULU
         Syntax: -x[ "$$$.SUB command line"]

         This  command will set a flag indicating that  when  the 
         current  NULU  command line is  exhausted,  NULU  should 
         terminate.  But the command is actually a toggle.  If it 
         is  entered  twice  on a line the effect of  the  second 
         issuance will be to negate the first.   If the  optional 
         parameter is passed, it will be written to a file called 
         $$$.SUB  on  drive A:  in the user area that was  active 
         when NULU was first loaded.  The line will be encoded as 
         a   SUBMIT  command  line  recognizable  by   the   CCP.  
         Therefore, when NULU exits, the CCP will reach into that 
         file and execute the line.   (CP/M Plus users take note:  
         the  $$$.SUB file will be written to the drive that  was 
         the   default   drive  when  NULU  was  first   loaded.)  
         Examples:



         1.  -x
         2.  -x -x
         3.  -x "nsweep b:"

         The above examples would produce the following results:

         1.  The  termination  flag  will be set  and  NULU  will 
         terminate when the current command line is exhausted.
         2.   The  termination flag is set and the  reset.   NULU 
         does not terminate.
         3.   The  termination  flag  is set and  a  file  called 
         $$$.SUB  is  created on the appropriate drive  with  the 
         command line "NSWEEP B:" encoded in it.



-Y       DISK DIRECTORY
         Syntax: -y[ filespec]

         This  command  will print an unsorted directory  of  the 
         disk  indicated by the parameter passed,  or a  complete 
         directory if none is passed.  The scope of the directory 
         may  be  limited by indicated the appropriate  ambiguous 
         filespec.

:R

-<       REDIRECT INPUT
         Syntax: -< filename

         This  command  will  cause NULU  to  open  the  filename 
         indicated  and begin accepting commands from it  instead 
         of  receiving them from the console.   This type of file 
         is,  in  effect,  a NULU command file.   Syntax  of  the 
         commands  in this file is identical in every way to  the 
         syntax used in normal NULU operation.  Each command line 
         in  the file must be terminated by a CR,LF.   If another 
         "-<"  command is encountered in the  file,  the  current 
         command  file  will  be closed and the new  one  opened.  
         After  the  commands  have  been  completely  processed, 
         control  will be returned to the console.   All  command 
         lines will be converted to upper case and echoed to  the 
         console before processing.  Any commands appearing after 
         a "-<" command will be ignored.

         The filename passed must be unambiguous.


->       REDIRECT OUTPUT
         Syntax: -> filename
         Syntax: ->

         With the first form of this command, NULU output will be 
         sent  to the filename indicated.   If the  file  already 
         exists, it will be deleted.  All special characters that 
         the  user  may have patched into NULU (see  below,  NULU 
         MODIFICATION) will be sent to the file as well, with the 
         exception  of  the EOF character,  26 (1ah).   The  only 
         output  not echoed to the file will be output caused  by 
         viewing or printing a member file.

         The filename passed must be unambiguous.

         Under  the  second  form of this  command,  the  current 
         output file, if any will be closed.  When NULU is caused 
         to  terminate,  the current output file is closed  along 
         with the current library, if any.
:E
                         ERROR MESSAGES

All NULU error messages are of the form:

ERROR XX: Explanation

where  "XX"  is some number from 0 to 255 and "Explanation" is  a 
clue as to the nature of the error.  Each error message is listed 
below,  along  with an explanation.   Suggestions about  ways  to 
handle the error are given when appropriate.

ERROR 63: ambiguity error
Problem:       This means that you entered an ambiguous  filespec 
               where an unambiguous filename was required.



ERROR 68: disk full
Problem:       The  library disk became full during file addition 
               or  KRUNCHing  or  the  destination  disk  of   an 
               extraction command became full.
Solution:      If  the  error  occurred  during  KRUNCHing,  NULU 
               should have recovered by itself, reopening the old 
               library.   If it did not recover, then you removed 
               the  original disk before the KRUNCH was  complete 
               or a serious read error occured.

               If  the  error occurs during file addition to  the 
               library,  operation should not be impaired, but no 
               files  that required additional disk space can  be 
               added  to the library.   Note that deleted entries 
               can still be overwritten by incoming files as long 
               as  the file sizes match.   The original file that 
               caused  the error will be recorded in the  library 
               directory as a deleted entry.


               If  the  error  occurs during file  extraction  or 
               unsqueezing   the  destination  file  is   deleted 
               because it is an incomplete file.   Extraction can 
               continue as before.

ERROR 73: invalid drive
Problem:       An  invalid drive for your system was chosen  (see 
               below,  NULU MODIFICATION) or a letter higher than 
               "P" was indicated.
Solution:      Choose another drive or re-patch NULU.

ERROR 77: not enough memory
Problem:       An  attempt  was  made to open a  library  with  a 
               directory  too  large  to be  accounted  for  with 
               available memory.
Solution:      Open  the library on a computer with a larger  TPA 
               and  reorganize  it  so it can be handled  by  the 
               smaller system.



ERROR 78: user cancel
Problem:       No problem.   NULU is simply letting the user know 
               why  an OPEN LIBRARY or KRUNCH operation has  been 
               cancelled.

ERROR 83: no directory space
Problem:       An  attempt  was made to create a file on  a  disk 
               with no free directory entries.

ERROR 85: file not found
Problem:       The  filespec indicated for some  operation  could 
               not be located.

ERROR 86: CP/M 2.x or higher required
Problem:       An  attempt was made to run NULU on a system  with 
               an CP/M version number of less than 2.0.



ERROR 88: seek to unwritten sector
Problem:       A  sector  required to gain access to  a  file  is 
               indicated by CP/M to be unwritten.
Solution:      The  library  directory  or  perhaps  the  library 
               itself has become trashed at some point.  Deleting 
               the  entry  and KRUNCHing will probably render  it 
               harmless,  but  the  safest course to take  is  to 
               obtain a fresh copy of the library.

ERROR 100: bad library directory
Problem:       The  file  specified  could not  be  opened  as  a 
               library  file.
Solution:      The  directory could be bad,  but most likely  the 
               file  simply isn't a library.   Check it out  with 
               some disk editor like SPZ or EDFILE.

ERROR 115: bad syntax
Problem:       Improper syntax was user to attempt some operation.



ERROR 116: squeeze decode table
Problem:       A  file has a squeeze decoding table,  but at some 
               point the table is trashed or perhaps is  missing.  
Solution:      None really; get a new copy of the file.

ERROR XX: undefined
Problem:       Unknown.
Solution:      Write   down  all  information  presented  on  the 
               terminal.   The number following the word ERROR is 
               especially important.  Get the information to  me.  
               Mail it or call and I will try to help.
