Re:	NULU 1.1 bug reports, et all


Salutations!

Q:	Is there a bug in NULU11 when extracting large files?
A:	Yes.  However, the bug has been verified by me in the following
	circumstances only:
	1)	Extracting from a library on a non-default drive to the
		default drive.
	2)	File must be larger than the file transfer buffer.
	3)	Verification by me of bug on Kaypro and Epson computers only.
	4)	Block size of 2K and less than 512K total disk capacity.

	This DOES NOT MEAN that I am certain that the error exists nowhere
	else.  This list of conditions merely represents several conditions
	which I consider pivotal in the creation of the problem.  If you know
	of others, please contact me.

	It should be noted that extracting to the same drive as the one on
	which the library resides causes no problem.  Additionally, if the
	original source file can be completely read into memory (i.e. only
	one pass is made at the source file) no problem will occur.

	At present I plan no patch to fix the problem.	However, a new release
	of NULU this summer should address the problem completely, as well
	as offer additional NULU features.

	Additional reports on problems that have been verified and can be
	repeated are welcome.  Come one, come all.
