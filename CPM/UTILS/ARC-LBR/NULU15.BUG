Just grabbed NULU15 off Poppourri this morning, and tried it out on
the previously reported problem(s).

When creating a new LBR on a different DU, it now remains on the
default drive from which called, as it should.  One bug dead.

However, the most serious is still there.  When extracting a large
file (about 70K in this case) from a LBR on my hard disk with 4K
blocks, to my floppy with 2K blocks, it trashes the file, with no
warning.  Only way to check it is run a CRC check on the results.

Well, the NULU bug has not been fixed.  The following display of the
directory tracks was taken after using NULU15 to remove a 55k file
from KERMT405.LBR on drive C0: (a drive with 8k minimum allocation
size) to drive F0: (a drive with 1k minimum allocation size).

 2 Files, occupying 55k of 191k total capacity
 60 directory entries and 152k bytes remain on b:

 Clearly there is something wrong with the third directory entry used
- anybody got any idea what?

Right.  And if you take a look at the file, you'll find your Ex 01 &
02, are really both Ex 02 (the THIRD extent).

 Did you call Murray?  I called once, so I think someone else should
advise him that v1.5 continues the tradition...

Oh, no!  Are you using LU-mode extraction or FILESWEEP-mode?  Do you
have the proper syntax in LU-mode?  (My success reports were on trials
performed in LU-mode.)

filesweep and lu-mode.  Seems to make no difference.  This is a
strange one, no?

See above messages.  I got NULU to fail by doing an unnatural
extraction. (Unnatural only because of my 6 logical HD drives and a
ramdisk; my FD hardly gets any use at all except to upload files
people send me!  I got yours today, thank you!!)
