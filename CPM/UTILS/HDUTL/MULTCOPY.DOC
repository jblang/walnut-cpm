      MULTCOPY   MULTIPLE FLOPPY DISKETTE FILE COPY

THE PURPOSE OF THIS PROGRAM IS TO COPY A GROUP OF FILES FROM A HARD DISK TO
MULTIPLE FLOPPY DISKS.  IF YOU ENTERED "PIP D:=LN*.COM" AND THERE WERE MORE
COM FILES THAN WOULD FIT ON ONE FLOPPY, PIP WOULD STOP WHEN THE FIRST DISK
WAS FULL.  MULTCOPY WILL PROMPT FOR ANOTHER DISK WHEN THE FIRST ONE IS FULL
AND CONTINUE TO COPY THE REST OF THE FILES.  THE FLOPPY DISK DRIVE IS HARD
CODED IN THE PROGRAM, BUT THE SOURCE HARD DISK MAY BE SPECIFIED IN THE COMMAND.
    EXAMPLE:  MULTCOPY B:*.ASC
      WOULD COPY ALL ASC FILES FROM HARD DISK B: TO THE FLOPPY DRIVE (D: IN
      MY VERSION) AND WOULD REQUEST MULTIPLE DISKS AS EACH GOT FULL.
