        FLOPCOPY.ASM     FLOPPY DISK COPY PROGRAM USING 1 DRIVE AND A HARD DISK
        WRITTEN BY G. YOUNG, PO BOX 3218, NORTH HOLLYWOOD, CA 91609

    FLOPCOPY IS A PROGRAM USED TO COPY ONE FLOPPY DISKETTE TO ANOTHER FLOPPY
IN SYSTEMS THAT HAVE ONLY ONE FLOPPY DRIVE BUT HAVE A HARD DISK.  IT WORKS
AS FOLLOWS: READ THE DIRECTORY OF THE FLOPPY DISK USING THE MASK IN THE COMMAND
TO CREATE A LIST OF FILES TO BE COPIED (EXAMPLE: FLOPCOPY *.ASC TO COPY ALL THE
ASC FILES FROM ONE FLOPPY TO ANOTHER).  THEN, USING THE LIST IN MEMORY, COPY
THE FILES FROM THE FLOPPY TO THE HARD DISK.  IF THE FILE ALREADY EXISTS ON THE
HARD DISK, ASK IF YOU WANT THE FILE COPIED OVER WITH THE FLOPPY VERSION AND 
SET AN INDICATOR IN THE FILE LIST THAT THIS FILE WAS ALREADY THERE.  THEN THE
PROGRAM WILL REQUEST THE BLANK DISKETTE THAT WILL BE THE DESTINATION DISK TO BE
MOUNTED.  USING THE FILE LIST NOW IN MEMORY, THE FILES ARE THEN COPIED FROM THE
HARD DISK TO THE BLANK FLOPPY.  WHEN ALL FILES HAVE BEEN COPIED, THE PROGRAM
WILL ASK IF ADDITIONAL COPIES ARE TO BE MADE.  IF NOT, THE FILES ARE DELETED
FROM THE HARD DISK.  IF THE FILE WAS ALREADY ON THE HARD DISK AS DETERMINED
BY INDICATOR SET PREVIOUSLY, THE FILE WILL NOT BE DELETED.  THE PROGRAM IS
SMART ENOUGH TO DETECT A FULL DISKETTE CONDITION AND A COMMAND WITHOUT
A MASK.
