	NOTE:  This program depends on NUMLIB being at 0E00H!
	----   ---------------------------------------------

M7FNK.COM is a program used to alter the function key assignments
for MDM724 and later versions.  M7MFNK takes no arguments on the
command line.  You will be prompted for the full file name to be
installed.  Drive/user spec is ok.

Next, the intercept character, the function key assignments and free
memory are displayed.  Command options are prefixed with a character
(A..K, Q and S).

Enter an "A" to change the intercept character.  It can be set to almost
anything, but should be a rarely used character (such as ^).  It can
also be a rarely used control character, such as an 'escape' or CTL-A.

Enter a "B", "C", etc to change the respective key definition.  The key
can be as long as free memory allows.  After entering the key definition
you have a chance to retain or delete the trailing RETURN, and then the
key will be inserted into the table, provided it fits.  To totally blank
a key, enter a null string and answer "N" to the trailing CR question.

When you are finished, you can use the "S" comamnd to save the file
back to disk.  As an alternative, you can also abort without update.

NOTE: a ^C aborts to CP/M anywhere except when entering a new INTERCEPT
CHARACTER.
