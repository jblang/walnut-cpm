DOC FOR MDMLNK v1.00 as of 03-26-84

MDMLNK is a utility for MDM7xx. It allows linking in the assembled
overlay file without the use of DDT. This may be a bit more foolproof
than the usuall DDT method.

MDMLNK is self-prompting and will ignore all command line parameters.
Upon entry, MDMLNK will ask for the INPUT file name. Enter the name of
the uninstalled MDM7xx.COM file and be sure to specify the full file
name. Next, you are asked for the HEX file name. Enter the full name
of the assembled overlay file and be sure to include the .HEX suffix.
Last, you will be asked for the OUTPUT filename. Enter the name of
the installed MDM7xx file. Again, be sure to specify the full file name.

MDMLNK will now first read the INPUT file, overlay it with the hex file,
then write a temporary file which is finally renamed to the output file
name. The temporary file is used so that the input file can be the same
as the output file, yet a disk error will not wipe out the original.

Errors will be reported for full directory, unable to write (disk full),
file not found, and in case the hex file is corrupt. All errors will
abort to CP/M, possibly leaving a file MDMLNK.$$$.

MDMLNK not only works on any MDM7 file of any size (within reason), but
it can also (BONUS!!!) be used with XMODEM or any other file which
will be overlaid by a HEX file which does not change its size.
