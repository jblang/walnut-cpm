TOPIC : M7LIB program for changing MDM7xx phone numbers

FROM  : IRV HOFF W6FFC

DATE  : 03 MAR 84


     M7LIB permits the user to quickly and very easily change the
telephone numbers in the MDM7xx phone library.  It automatically
finds the phone library in MDM7xx.COM, lists the library and then
(after asking it if looks normal) displays a command line:


CTL-C abort, <C>hange, <D>elete, <P>rint lib, <R>ead, <W>rite :


     To change or alter any line (such as the "F" line), you would
     then type:


CTL-C abort, <C>hange, <D>elete, <P>rint lib, <R>ead, <W>rite : CF


     The "C" would select "Change" and the "F" selects the line you
     wish to change.

     This same technique would be used to delete any line that is no
     longer needed.  Using  "DH" for example leaves the  "D=" but
     clears the rest of the line.


     Whenever you change any line, you must go completely to the last
     column prior to the  <  at which time the new line is then added
     automatically and the new listing displayed.  This sets a flag
     so if you hit CTL-C to abort it will ask if you want to update
     the file or abort with no changes.  You can also use "W" to write
     the file to disk when finished with any changes.


USING THE PROGRAM:
-----------------

	This program works directly with the MDM7xx.COM file.  It
	does not use or need the .ASM file at all.
	
     EXAMPLES:  A>M7LIB MDM7.COM <ret>		(1)
                A>M7LIB B:MDM7.COM <ret>	(2)
                B>A:M7LIB MDM7.COM <ret>	(3)
		A>M7LIB MDM7.COM ABC.COM	(4)
	        B>A:M7LIB B:MDM7.COM C:ABC.COM	(5)

	1) works only with the original file, altering it
	2) the file can be on any selected disk
	3) similar to (2) but M7LIB.COM is on another disk
	4) if a 2nd file is named, it receives the changes
	5) any of the files can be on any selected disk


NOTE:   Using M7LIB.COM to alter the telephone number library is
	surprisingly simple and fast.  It does not however allow
	setting or resetting codes for SPRINT, MCI, etc.  To do
	that you would need to use M7NM-x.ASM.  (This also allows
	extensive changing with your editor, such as adding or
	removing the "1-" that is required in some areas for long
	distance dialing, etc.
