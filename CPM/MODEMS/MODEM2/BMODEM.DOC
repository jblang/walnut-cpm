     BMODEM.DOC

THIS IS A VERY BASIC MODEM PROGRAM FOR THOSE WHO DON'T HAVE
THE PATIENCE FOR DEALING WITH MBOOT3.  THE ONLY LINE THAT NEEDS
ALTERING IS 280 IN WHICH YOU PUT MODEM PORTS IN (HEX OR DEC) AND THE
RECIEVE & SEND BIT MASKS.

When you run the program it will act like a very dumb terminal
Use it to log on and setup XMODEM to send you a better modem program
or USQ.  CTRL E asks you for the filename to be received.  An ESC will
transmit CTRL C to the remote machine.  A tilde will transmit a CTRL
S.To dial the Hayes modem enter ATDT <phone number>

Altered for the Xerox 820,820-II, and 16/8 on 12/07/84
