files:
	       AR5:CPM;MTN21 OFFCOM
	       AR5:CPM;MTN21 OFFHEX
	       AR5:CPM;TRSURT ASM
are.

	The first file is the COM file of MTN21 offset
to load at 4300H. The second is the HEX of the first.
The offset program is intended to run on the TRS80 Model I.
Note that AR1:CPM;MTNMSG OVR will work fine with the offset
version, be sure and rename it to MTNMSGS.OVR on you system.
The third file in the list is an initiation program which
does a master reset of the TRS80 UART, sets the baud rate
and sets the control port.
