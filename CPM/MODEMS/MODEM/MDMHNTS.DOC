				  Modem Hints

	 So you finally decided to get a fast modem! Maybe you got it to
    save costs on the phone bill or maybe you just got tired of 300 baud.
    Well now there are other things you need to do to insure that you can
    enjoy the higher speed.

	 Here are some hints and then a listing of the AT Hayes command set
    with info on each command which may help you get the most out the new
    modem. Some of the things I will be talking about may only apply to the
    Supra Modem 2400 but, I think, most will apply to all modems. I hope it
    will help you with the new and strange modem. Let's get started!!

	 The first thing to do is to load your favorite terminal program
    and start to make changes to it. What do we look for?? Welll first
    let's make sure the program and new modem are compatabile. Go to the
    modem parameters spot  in your program and look to see if your modem is
    listed. If it is you are in great shape, but if it isn't don't despair.
    See if Hayes, Hayes Smartmodem and Compatatibles is listed. In most
    cases the higher speed modem is partly or all the way compatabile with
    the Hayes command set. If you don't find your exact modem listed then
    select the Hayes or Hayes Smartmodem to be the default.

	 Next look and see if you have a Carrier Phase default listing. It
    may say High or Low or (+) Positive or (-) Negative. Select High or (+)
    Positive as this is what Hayes type modems need. If you are using a
    Commodore 1670 select (-) or Low as the Commodore always has to be
    different as you probably already know.

	 Check the Carrier Wait and see if it is 30 seconds as this is
    usually what Hayes type modems have as a default. This can be changed
    as you will see as we go through the different commands. It really is
    no big thing except when you call long distance.

	 I suggest that you save these changes as a default at this time
    and then turn on your modem. We will start going through some of the
    changes that may be needed on it next.

	 Now let's see what is going on with the modem and your terminal
    program talking with each other.

	 If you have a command line at the top of your screen when in
    terminal mode check to see if you have the word CARRIER lit up or
    flashing. (sometimes it's at the bottom of the screen too.) If you do
    in most cases you will want to change the carrier detect command in the
    modem. You do this by using the following command in terminal mode. AT
    &C1  This causes the modem's DCD circuit to track the carrier from the
    BBS or remote modem and switch on when the carrier is correct for your
    modem. By the way, you can usually make this permanent by typing: AT
    &C1 &W . Please note that I used all caps. You can use all caps or all
    lower case. For example, at &c1 &w is correct also. At &c1 &W is not
    correct and will give an error.

	 Here are some other commans which you may want to change.
	 1. AT L - This command selects low speaker volume. If the speaker
    drives you out of the  house change this one. You can select L2 for
    medium volume or L3 for high volume. L2 is usually default but on the
    Supra it was to loud.
	 2. AT V - Causes result codes to be displayed as numbers. I didn't
    like this so I selected AT V1 which displayes them as words. Now I can
    see that I am connected and at 2400 baud plus all other commands work
    with something that I can understand right away.
	 3. AT Q1 - If after making sure everything is working as you wish
    and you no longer want to see the result codes then use this command.
    If you are not happy with this then use AT Q to get them back.

	 You can change many other commands. The AT Hayes Commands listed
    below will give you many of them. Check your manual for other possible
    changes.

	 You can put all of these commands on one line if you wish. Here is
    an example. AT &C1 V1 L &W	If your modem has memory for changes like
    this you can (&W) write it to that memory and it should default to
    those commands on your next power-up. This is very handy and saves a
    lot of time and frustration.

	 Let's take a look at several of the S Registers that are of
    interest to us. S7, S8 and S10 are the most important and may need to
    be changed.

	 Register S7 is the one that  that will hang up if a carrier is not
    detected is a set amount of time. Default is usually 30 seconds. I have
    left mine at that setting but you can set it lower if you wish. Some
    terminal programs will do that for you.

	 Register S8 sets the delay a comma in the phone number will cause.
    Default is usually 2 seconds. Change it if you need to. I haven't
    changed it at all. You can always put in two comms if you need more
    delay.

	 Register S10 is the one I change if the phone line is noisy. It is
    normally set  for 1.4 seconds (14) but I have changed it to as much as
    10 seconds (100) if the line is bad. Please try it at the default first
    and change it only if you need to. If you change it to 255 then it will
    not drop out at all. I have never had to do that.

	 Some terminal programs have a high and low baud adjust. If yours
    does then here are some hints.
	 1. Adjust only the Lo or the low byte.
	 2. Write down the default so you can get back to it if needed.
	 3. I highly recommend a terminal program that has this function if
    you are going to operate at 2400 baud. BobsTermPro and Ultraterm does.
    I understand some others do as well.

	 This function is a fine tune adjustment due to the fact that the
    timing of the Commodore is done by software and each is just a little
    different. Here is how Genie and BobsTermPro suggests you do it:
	 1. Sign on to a BBS and find a large text file to look at. The
    bigger the better.
	 2. Check to see if you have any garbled characters or lines.
	 3. If you do have bad character or lines go to the baud adjust and
    set the number (mine is 113 at 2400 baud) about 5 higher (118) or lower
    (108) and see if the file looks better. If not-go the other direction
    and see if it improves. Continue doing this until the file comes in to
    your terminal as clean as possible. You can also go up until the text
    comes in messy and write down the number. Then go down until the same
    thing happens. You can then find the middle point and use it as the
    default setting. This should give you the best setting for up and down
    loads. DO NOT ADJUST THE HIGH BYTE!!!! The high byte adjust is a very
    coarse adjustment and can really get you out in left field.

	 Listed below is the AT Hayes Command set as of 1986. It was of
    great help to me when I set the Supra Modem 2400 up. I hope it will
    help you also. I will try to give a description of the things I did to
    the phone lines and the computer on another file.

+-------------------------------+
+  Functions & Features of the	+
+     S-Register commands	+
+-------------------------------+
Values in prarenthesis are the ASCII Character.
Numeric values are the ASCII Decimal Code value.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
S0	Sets number of rings before auto-answer
	Default value is usually 1.
S1	Counts & stores the number of rings from an incoming call.
S2	Sets the escape code sequence.	The default is 43.  (+)
S3	Sets the ASCII character recognized as a Carriage Return <CR>.
	The default value is usually 13.
S4	Sets the ASCII character recognized as a Line Feed.
	The default value is usually 10.
S5	Sets the ASCII character recognized as a Backspace.
	The default value is usually 8.
S6	Sets number of seconds modem will wait for a dial tone.
	The default value is 2 seconds.
S7	Sets the number of seconds the modem is to wait for a carrier signal
	after dialing, before it sends the NO CARRIER message.
	The default value is 30 seconds.
S8	Sets the duration of the pause for the Comma (,) and the Repeat (>)
	commands.  The default value is 2 seconds.
S9	Sets the required duration, in tenths of a second, that the modem
	modems carrier signal must be present before the local modem will
	recognize it.  (Carrier Detect time).  The default value is 0.6 seconds.
S10	Sets the duration, in tenths of a second, that the modem waits after
	loss of carrier before hanging up.  The default is 0.7 seconds.

	You can adjust this value upwards to defeat Call Waiting.
S11	Sets the duration and spacing of Touch-Tones during dialing.  The
	default value is 70 milliseconds.
S12	Sets the duration, in 50ths of a second, of the guard time required
	in the escape code sequence.  The default value is 1 second.
S13	Undefined and unallocated.
S14	Sets the modem product result code.  The default is 24n.
	To use Smartcom 2.0 with a 2400 baud modem, try resetting this
	value to 120.  Use S14 to re-set the the I0 request as follows.
	1)  Issue an ATS14=120 <CR> when you load Smartcom 2.0
	2)  Exit Smartcom
	3)  Reenter Smartcom.
	Smartcom 2.1 and later versions work properly with 2400 baud modems.
S15	Undefined and unallocated.
S16	Modem self testing.  The default value is 0.
	0 = Data mode - no testing
	1 = Analog loopback test
	2 = Dial test
	3 = Undefined and unallocated
	4 = Test pattern
	5 = Analog loopback and Test pattern.
	You can perform these tests at either 1200 or 2400 baud.
HOW TO CHANGE AN S-REGISTER VALUE
---------------------------------
You may change any S-Register value.
For example...To change the default value of S-Register #7 to decrease the
amount of the the modem waits for a carrier detect before issuing the NO
CARRIER command, you would first query the default setting, and then issue
a new setting.
1)  Type the following string	ATS7=?
2)  Modem will answer with a result, usually 30 (seconds).
3)  Type the following string	ATS7=15
4)  Modem will answer OK
What you have just done will make the modem issue the NO CARRIER command if
carrier is not received within 15 seconds, instead of 30 seconds.  This is
helpful in dialing busy bulletin board systems.
