Subject:  Minor Bug in List Buffer/File
To: INFO-MTN at MIT-MC
cc: FJW at MIT-MC, BUG-MTN at MIT-MC

In trying to be clever and using Kelley Smith's trick to record ^Z's
(1AH) in the buffer by changing them to 9AH (in TEXT MODE), I left
code in the List Buffer/File routine which strips the parity bit
before checking to see if it is 1AH, the CP/M text EOF mark.  This
turns out to be redundant anyway, as it is checked at another point
(without the masking) before it is returned to this routine.

Since my terminal sees ^Z as the cursor up command from EMACS, a List
Buffer or File will display a premature and false End of File message
when that character has been recorded as 9AH.  However, the buffer is
actually much longer as is still recording, and, more importantly, the
entire buffer WILL be written to disk past the false ^Z.

Here are the patches for MTN 2.1:

	11E2  FE => 00   (11E4 for 2.2)
	11E3  1A => 00   (11E5 for 2.2)
	11E4  28 => 00   (11E6 for 2.2)
	11E5  3F => 00   (11E7 for 2.2)

Sorry for any inconvenience this may have caused you.

Subject:  New MTN (version 2.1) now available
To: INFO-CPM at MIT-MC, INFO-MTN at MIT-MC

A new MicroTELNET (MTN) Version 2.1 is now available.  The HEX files
are rather large and have been broken into three HEXn files each.
(They are also available in the original form as one HEX file each.)
They may be reconstructed using the technique described below.

Also available, upon request, is a 4300H-based version for those of
you using systems requiring that as the starting address of their
TPA...

The files are:

MC:CPM;MTN21 HEX  321 recs, 41053 bytes, CRC= 76E1.  MTN21.COM file CRC= D958

MC:CPM;MTN21 HEX1 107 recs, 13680 bytes, CRC= 9D68.
MC:CPM;MTN21 HEX2 107 recs, 13680 bytes, CRC= E0AD.
MC:CPM;MTN21 HEX3 107 recs, 13693 bytes, CRC= 325F.


MC:CPM;MTNMSG HEX  394 recs, 50413 bytes, CRC= 4B47. MTNMSGS.OVR file CRC= BBC1

MC:CPM;MTNMSG HEX1 132 recs, 16830 bytes, CRC= 15D4.
MC:CPM;MTNMSG HEX2 132 recs, 16830 bytes, CRC= 219C.
MC:CPM;MTNMSG HEX3 131 recs, 16753 bytes, CRC= FEE6.


The doc file is MC:CPM;MTN21 DOC which is mainly a "what's new"
document.

To merge the HEXn files into the required files:

DDT MTN21-1.HEX
IMTN21-2.HEX
R
IMTN21-3.HEX
R
^C
SAVE 57 MTN21.COM

Similarly for MTNMSGS.OVR.  (SAVE 70 MTNMSGS.OVR)

Again, bug reports and/or feature requests to BUG-MTN@MIT-MC.

Dear MTN Users,

I am removing the MTN files from MC:CPM; and will "shortly" (whatever
*that* means) upload a significantly newer version with MANY new
features and ALOT of bugs fixed.  Release of this new version will be
what I consider premature, but only in the sense that I haven't been
able to install and check out ALL the features that everybody has
asked to be included.  Since some of you have received a pre-release
version of MTN 2.0 in various stages of development, the new release
will be called MTN 2.1 to bring you back in sync.

I must add that the reason for doing this was prompted by a rather
embarrassing discovery of a piece of code that has been in the program
from its beginnings which was lifted from another modem program and
seemed to work.  In tracking down a bug near that code, I found that
what I had assumed to be correct was not.  THIS ONLY APPLIES TO USERS
OF MTN 2.0 AND BELOW WHO HAVE A D.C. HAYES MODEM.  THE PMMI CODE IS
CORRECT, EXCEPT THAT IT DOES NOT HANG UP THE PHONE WITH THE TERMINATE
COMMAND.

So, rather than leave this faulty code around for even more
unsuspecting people to pick up and not let me know they have it (so as
to be on the mailing list for upgrade announcements), I am removing it
from further circulation.

My sincere apologies for any inconvenience this may have caused you.

[For those of you interested in what the bug was that got me upset:

For some reason, the original author of this section of code decided
to turn on the transmit enable signal BEFORE dialing the number,
rather than AFTER receiving the carrier detect signal from the remote
modem.  What lead me to check this out was that I was trying to speed
up the dialing back to specs and could not find out why another
auto-dialing modem program I had was successful in completing calls,
while my version, using the same timing was not.  I also discovered,
in the same section of code, that the modem setup was not correct
either.  Thus the withdrawal announcement.

If you get this msg, you're on this list.  If you do not wish to be on
this list, send me a msg (and NOT this list).

Patch locations for MTN 1.3 are available in MC:CPM;MTN13 PATCH to
change ports addresses, etc.

MTN 1.4 is actively in the works - more info on that soon.
