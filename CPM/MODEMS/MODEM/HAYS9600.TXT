This file was put together in an effort to disspell some of the rumors and
inaccuracies about the recently-announced HAYES 9600 baud modems.
 
Well, HAYES finally announced their new line of 9600 baud modems, known as the
V-Series. Of course, these modems are not compatible with any of the 9600 baud
modems currently on the market (as of 6-18-87). There are, however, quite a
few similarities between the HAYES V-Series, and the U.S. Robotics Courier HST
9600 modem, which the HAYES seems to be patterned after, but not identical to.
 
Three versions were announced at the big COMDEX show in Atlanta last week.
First, there is the external, known as the V-series Smartmodem 9600(TM). The
modem is physically similar in both appearance and size to the HAYES Smart-
modem 2400(TM). It is, of course, fully compatible with its lower-speed
predecessors. An internal version has also been announced, the V-series Smart-
modem 9600B(TM). Additionally, an upgrade kit will be available to convert the
HAYES 2400 to 9600 baud operation. List prices are $1299 (external), $1199
(internal), and $399 (upgrade kit). A Sysop special discount offer is expected
to be offered by HAYES in the near future. The Sysop price will be $595, and
will likely be limited to two per Sysop. These modems should be available at
the end of July, 1987, according to HAYES.
 
Following is a description of the Smartmodem 9600 EXTERNAL modem:
 
The HAYES V-series 9600 external modem offers fast turnaround, half-duplex
V.32 communications at a much lower cost than V.32 full-duplex modems; error-
control and forward error-correction; increased throughput with adaptive
compression in its error-control mode; and with automatic feature negotiation.
 
A "ping-pong" protocol used at 9600 and 4800 bps incorporates special
synchronizing techniques for a fast line turnaround, and simulates full-duplex
V.32 operation in terminal or interactive mode, which makes it
indistinguishable from full-duplex operation. When performing fast downloads
of large data files from mainframes to PCs, or full-screen data transfers
where the volume of data in the reverse direction is small (for example: on-
line airline reservation scheduling), the ping-pong protocol automatically
allocates the direction of activity on the line in proportion to the volume of
data that is being transmitted.
 
The built-in error-control provides a reliable means of correcting errors that
may occur during the transmission, due to noise on telephone lines. When the
V-series Smartmodem 9600 connects to a remote V-series product, it automatic-
ally activates its error-control, using an ARQ protocol that automatically
requests a re-transmission of any corrupted data.
 
Error-correction in the V-series modems is achieved with Asynchronous Framing
Technique (AFT), a protocol based on the LAP-B (Link Access Protocol-Balanced)
link level portion of X.25 at 2400 bps and 1200 bps, and an extension of LAP-B
at 9600 bps and 4800 bps. At 9600 bps and 4800 bps, the V-series Smartmodem
9600 implements Trellis Encoded/Viterbi Decoding, which is a forward error
correcting technique that allows the modem to transmit data accurately, even
across noisy telephone lines at very high speeds.
 
When communicating with other V-series modems, the V-series Smartmodem 9600
uses adaptive compression to increase throughput and provide up to twice the
normal data transfer, thus lowering both the connect time, and transmission
costs. Adaptive compression adjusts itself to the type of data which is being
transmitted, and is automatically enabled when the modem is in error-control
mode; no user preparation or interaction of the data is necessary at either
end of the connection.
 
Feature negotiation makes it possible for the modem to distinguish between V-
series hardware and other HAYES modems. It then analyzes all options available
(including speed), then automatically selects the combination that maximizes
data transmission efficiency. Upon the initial modem handshake, the V-series
Smartmodem 9600 has the capability to fall back from 9600 bps to 4800, 2400,
1200 or 300 bps.
