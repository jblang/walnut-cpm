============= 2400B HAYES MODEM COMMANDS LIST =============



Here is a list of the S-registers used by Hayes modem.  Please be aware
that not all modems support these registers and that some modems may
have more registers than are listed.

All S register commands are entered in the "AT" commend line.

     Example: AT S8=2 S2=43 S7=30

To read the value in any register, use

         AT SX? <CR>

The modem should echo the value found in the regester x.
