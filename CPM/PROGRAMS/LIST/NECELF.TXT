NEC ELF FIX

(A little WD40 saves the day)

My Kaypro Letter Quality Printer - the NEC Elf - suddenly began
doing funny things during print time.  One characteristic was
that it began refusing to return to the left margin, stopping
short by any where from two characters to five or ten.  This made
the letters I was producing look a trifle odd as the indentations
kept moving to the right with each paragraph, right down the
page.  Sometimes it took 6 printings before I got the copy I
intended.  Also, the printer made a horrible noise - rather like
the gear was clashing somehow.  Not wishing to pay a large repair
bill (or even a small one), I asked the local computer store if
they had heard of a similar problem from their customers.  Yes,
they had.  The solution - put a little WD40 on a soft cloth and
run it along the rail that the print head runs across on.  This
enables the print head to make a full pass and put the
indentations where they are supposed to be placed.  An
inexpensive solution to a potentially expensive repair visit.
