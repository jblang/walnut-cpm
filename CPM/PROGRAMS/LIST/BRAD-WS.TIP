I'm glad you like Bradford.  Because Bradford actually draws each character
dot by dot in high-resolution graphics mode, you must run the program to
print a document -- it doesn't just set a mode in your printer; it actively
creates the output.  So to print your WordStar files, you must save them
on disk, then run Bradford to print them.
 
Although I sent you this message here, be advised that I won't be calling
here for a long time after 19 January.

Well, you're really supposed to get this info from the manual,
but to get your dot commands interpreted rather than printed,
press a period (.) rather than RETURN at the "command character" 
prompt.
 
I'm going on a long trip to my next semester at the University
of Illinois, but don't tell anyone...
 
Happy new year to you too.
