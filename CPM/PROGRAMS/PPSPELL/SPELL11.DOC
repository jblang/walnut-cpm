Alan Bomberger originally wrote SPELL in zilog mnemonics and my guess is that
it was assembled by M80.  If you delete all pseudoops in the beginning and add
the pseudoop .z80, the program should assemble with M80.  The current pseudoops
are for PASM-II which I used to assemble it. (This is an advertisement.  PASM
will assemble just about anything for the 8080/Z80.) As to the question of a
lex.  I just typed in the program from Dr. Dobbs' and added the file output,
etc.  Then I ran the program against everything that I had written in the last
year (in small increments) and sorted and checked each word to eliminate errors
and duplication. Presto!  I now have a base dictionary of some 7,500 words. 
The master lex is named MASTER.LEX.  Any unknown words are collected in
SPELL.LEX and sorted and checked for spelling.  Periodically, I add the new
words to the MASTER.LEX.  Without compression, the lex takes 10k per 1000
words.  Alan Bomberger will sell you a 30,000 word lex for $30.  See Dr. Dobbs.

Here's how to assemble SPELL-11.ASM with M80 (which I don't normally use. 1)
Change name from SPELL-11.ASM to SPELL.MAC. 2) Delete pseudo-ops at beginning
of file (.TITLE to .PLINK) up to ASEG.  Add before ASEG the pseudo-op .Z80. 
Thus the first two lines of the file should be .Z80 and ASEG. 3) Assemble -- 
M80 =SPELL 4) Link --  L80 SPELL,SPELL/N/E 5) You now have SPELL.COM.  Try it.
It works!!! 6) Read the notes in the beginning of the file and Alan Bomberger's
article in the April 82 Dr. Dobbs to see how to use it.  Any further
questions???
