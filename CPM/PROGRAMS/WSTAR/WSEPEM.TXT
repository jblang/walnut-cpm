     A summary of a MICROSYSTEMS article by Ernest E. Mau 
recently appeared in the XA-1 data base under the name 
WSEPSN.MOD, 70007,642.  It shows how Wordstar can use many of the 
features of an Epson MX-80 with Graftrax+.  However it did not 
allow easy use of the emphasized mode of the Epson, because 
compressed print, superscripts, and subscripts cannot mix with 
the emphasized mode; that is, the emphasized mode must be turned 
off first before using these other modes.
 
     The following changes can be made through the Install 
program in order to allow Wordstar to use the emphasized mode in 
a transparent manner.  A change from the Wordstar modifications 
of Mau is that ITALICS ON has been changed from USR1:(^Q) to 
ROLUP:(^T).  ITALICS OFF is also ^T.  The reason is that 
WORDSTAR, after doing ROLUP: on a ^T, automatically does ROLDOW: 
for the next ^T.  ^Q will now be used to turn off double strike, 
superscript, and subscript modes.
 
 
Compressed on (^A)
 
PALT:    03
PALT:+1  1B    These two lines turn
PALT:+2  46    emphasized off.
PALT:+3  0F    This turns compressed on.
 
 
Compressed off (^N)
 
PSTD:    03
PSTD:+1  12    This turns compressed off.
PSTD:+2  1B    These two lines turn
PSTD:+3  45    emphasized on.
 
 
Double width toggle (^Y)
 
RIBBON:    03
RIBBON:+1  1B    These lines turn
RIBBON:+2  57    Double Width
RIBBON:+3  01    ON.
 
RIBOFF:    03
RIBOFF:+1  1B    These lines turn
RIBOFF:+2  57    Double Width
RIBOFF:+3  00    OFF.
 
 
Italics toggle  (^T)
 
ROLUP:    02    This routine is used
ROLUP:+1  1B    when ^T is given to
ROLUP:+2  34    turn ON italics.
 
ROLDOW:    02   This routine is used
ROLDOW:+1  1B   when ^T is given to
ROLDOW:+2  35   turn OFF italics.
 
 
 
Turn OFF doublestrike, super & subscripts (^Q)
 
USR1:    04
USR1:+1  1B  Turns OFF
USR1:+2  48  doublestrike, super & subscripts.
USR1:+3  1B  Turns ON
USR1:+4  45  emphasized.
 
 
 
Subscript ON (^W)
 
USR2:    05
USR2:+1  1B  Turns OFF
USR2:+2  46  emphasized.
USR2:+3  1B  Turns ON
USR2:+4  53  subscript (using the non-zero first byte of USR3: as 
             the 5th byte!).
 
 
Superscript ON (^E)
 
USR3:    05
USR3:+1  1B  Turns OFF
USR3:+2  46  emphasized.
USR3:+3  1B  Turns ON
USR3:+4  53  superscript (using the zero first byte of USR4: as 
             the 5th byte!  USR4: cannot be used.).
 
 
USR4:(^R) cannot be used and must have 00 as first byte
 
USR4:  00    This byte is used for USR3: to complete the 
             superscript sequence.
 
 
 
Printer initialization sequence
 
PSINIT:    07
PSINIT:+1  1B  These bytes give
PSINIT:+2  40  a reset.
PSINIT:+3  1B  Don't skip over
PSINIT:+4  4F  perforation.
PSINIT:+5  1B  Turn ON
PSINIT:+6  45  emphasized.
PSINIT:+7  0D  Carriage Return.
 
 
Printer Finished sequence
 
PSFINI:    03
PSFINI:+1  1B  These bytes give
PSFINI:+2  40  a reset.
PSFINI:+3  0D  Carriage Return.
 
 
 
     If a ZAP program is available, you should also modify the 
Help menus in the file WSMSGS.OVR to reflect the preceding 
changes.  Be very careful and only replace ASCII characters.  
Some creative abbreviations may be necessary.  Be sure to use
a backup copy and test it thoroughly.
