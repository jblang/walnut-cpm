MAILMERGE FIX
by Dale Cockle, Kaypro Club Austin, August 1987

(A fix for a DOT command bug)

WORDSTAR/MAILMERGE:  If the topmost dot command in a document
that you are mailmerging is printed on the second and subsequent
iterations, and it appears that the dot command is not
functioning, try the following:

Call up the document (the basic document, not the mailmerge file)
and go to the bottom of the file (CTL-Q, C).  Making sure there
is a hard carriage return at the end of the last line indicated
by a ">" character at right edge of screen, there probably will
be a period following (below) that ">".  This period combined
with the period of the first dot command are combining to form a
comment -- a bug in some versions of Wordstar.

To beat the bug, put your cursor on the left margin of the last
(empty) line of the document, erase to the end of the line (CTL-
Q, Y) to make sure that there are no unprintable characters on
the line (e.g., spaces) and enter a period on the left margin. 
This period and the period on the right edge of the screen will
combine into a blank dot command comment allowing the dot command
on the top of the document to function as it should as a dot
command.
