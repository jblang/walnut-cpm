MULTIPLE LINE HEADERS AND FOOTERS
by Ann Molison, Lakewood/Long Beach KUG, May 1987

(How do you make a multiple line header or footer with WordStar?)

The first step is to turn off word wrap (CTRL-OW).  Then type the
header (or footer) on Page 1, Line 1, Col. 1.  Your line can be
as long as 194 characters.  Some versions of WordStar will permit
up to 240 characters.  You will have to design your writing to
have appropriate text breaks.  When you are finished putting in
your text, return to the beginning of the line (Ctrl- QS) and add
the dot command .HE or .FO.  You will then need to add an
additional dot command to adjust the page length.  Use .PL to do
this.  Every extra line used by the header reduces the number of
lines available for the rest of the document.  For a two-line
header/footer, use the dot command .PL 65, for a three line
header/footer, use the command .PL 64.  Not all printers will
adjust the page length correctly.
