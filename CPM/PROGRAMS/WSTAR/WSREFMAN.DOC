in order to change the initial values evident when WordStar
begins operation (i.e., the default conditions) or to disable or
modify many of the WordStar features.  Related material is
contained in the Terminal Installation Areas  (USER1) where
features involve the installation of terminal devices and the
Printer Installation Areas (USER4A, USER4B, USER4C and USER4D)
where provision for printer installation is provided.

The WordStar Features Installation Area is composed of three
basic types of installation areas; the INITIALIZATION ITEMS, the
CUSTOMIZATION ITEMS and the KEYBOARD INSTALLATION ITEMS.  Any of
the items in these areas may be changed using the LABEL PATCHER
in your WordStar's installation utility (INSTALL or WINSTALL).
If you have WordStar Revision 3.3 or later, many of the
INITIALIZATION INITIALIZATION and CUSTOMIZATION ITEMS may be
changed by selecting the WORDSTAR FEATURES option at the
"INSTALLATION MENU".  Slecting this option will display a menu of
some of the following features.  Features displayed in this menu
may be changed simply by following the instructions that are
displayed subsgequent to selecting the feature of interest at
this menu.  Where a feature discussed in his section is subject
to menued installed, an asterisk appears to the left of the label
in the summary of that features action.

1.   INITIALIZATION ITEMS:  Initialization items can be altered
by the user while using WordStar via an appropriate WordStar
     command at the keyboard or via dot commands at print time.
     Changing an initialization items via byte changes in this
     area will cause WordStar to come up in your desired
     "default" condition thus eliminating the need to issue the
     relevant command each time WordStar is invoked.  The
     initialization items are:

*  ITHELP:        initial HELP LEVEL
     NITHLF:        MAXIMUM HELP LEVEL message control
     *  ITITOG:        Initial INSERT condition control
     *  ITDSDR:        Initial OPENING-MENU DIRECTORY display
     control
     *  INITPF:        Initial PAGE FORMATTING conditions
     (INITPF:-INITPF:+18H)
     *  INITLM:        Initial LEFT MARGIN
     *  INITRM:        Initial RIGHT MARGIN
     INITSR:        Initial SUB/SUPERSCRIPT ROLL

     characterize the differences between NON-DOCUMENT and
                    DOCUMENT MODE.

3.   KEYBOARD INSTALLATION ITEMS:


This information is presented in a format designed to provide
help quickly.  Where material is covered in more detail by one of
the questions in the Technical Support Manual, the relevant
material is referenced below the "Instructions" column and/or
next to the word "REFERENCE."

The material is keyed to the label for which an action or
installation feature is implemented.  (See Question LABL-1 for a
discussion of labels and Question LABL-7 regarding changes to
label usage with newly released products.)

     The number to the immediate right of the label refers to the
number of bytes provided to implement a function.  This number
can range from 1 to 128.  Note that when an area is intended for
the installation of a string, one of these bytes must be used for
the number of bytes in the string.  This is important when using
the Label Patcher of the newly released product (see Question
LABL-7), since the new Label Patcher does not automatically
install the number of bytes input by the operator for any given
string.  The user must, therefore, remember to subtract one byte
from this number under such circumstances.

Below the "Instructions" for each label, you'll find the type and
absolute address of the installation area for the most current
revisions of any MicroPro product subject to terminal
installations by means of a User Area.  The WordStar product
prefix is followed by the revision (or version) number.  These
lines are divided into two groups which identify the operating
system under which they are functional.


TYPE

Installation areas may be of four types:

1.   Flags.  Flags enable or disable a program feature and
usually take on a value of 00 or FF, although other values are
     possible.  A flag that has values other than 00 or FF will
     be explained further in the label instructions. (See
     Question INTR-3 for a more detailed discussion of flags.)

2.   Strings.  A string is one or more characters sent to a
peripheral device to affect the behavior of the device in some
     predictable way.  The first character of any string
     installed in your program must be the number of characters
     in the string and not one of the characters of the string to
     be sent.  (See Question INTR-4 for a more detailed
     discussion of strings and Question #_____ regarding the
     requirements of new product releases.)

                                4







3.   Values.  A value is usually one or two bytes used by the
program to calculate or modify the consequences of an operation.
     Screen height (HITE:) and screen width (WID:) are examples
     of values.  Unless otherwise indicated, values may be
     between 00 and FF hexadecimal.















































                                5






4.   Address.  An address is a special location in memory, the
contents of which is needed by the program to execute a function.
     User areas that require an address provide two bytes for
     installation.  Many times a user area that requires an
     address is pre-installed with an address.  When this is the
     case, the address currently in that area is used to
     calculate a new address or can be used to access a
     subroutine (OUTCHR: and PBGMEM:, for example).  When
     patching addresses into your program, remember to install
     the address so that the second (or low order) byte of the
     address is the first byte in the user area.


ABSOLUTE_ADDRESS

The absolute address of any label is rarely needed for simple
installations but may prove to be useful in complex installations
where one or more of the advanced installation techniques are
used.  (See Question LABL-1 for a discussion of the relative
advantages of using labels and absolute addresses in patching.)
Note that all patch areas may not be available in all products.
Where any particular patch area is not available, this is
reflected in the absolute address area as an "na" (not
available).

When doing installations, follow these guidelines:

1.   Enter, as the first byte of any string, the number of
     bytes to be sent.  (See Question LABL-7.)

2.   Enter the second byte of the address first.

3.   Use a label rather than the absolute address whenever
     possible.

4.   Never enter more characters than the number to the
     right of the label in the following user area descriptions.

5.   Always enter values, addresses, and characters in
     hexadecimal.

WORDSTAR INITIALIZATION FEATURES

LABEL     # OF BYTES                   DESCRIPTION & USE

          ITHELP:        3    The value placed at this label controls the
initial "HELP" level which will be used on entry to WordStar. It
                    is normally changed during use of WordStar
                    with the Control-JH command and is preset to
                    3 in the WordStar that comes from MicroPro to
                    provided maximum help (i.e., all menus are
                    displayed during editing).  If you wish,
                    enter a 02 at this label to suppress the main
                    editing menu (thus making more of the screen
                    available for text display). To suppress the
                    Prefix Help Menus as well, enter a 01 at this
                    label.  Entering a 00 at this label will
                    suppress all help menus and messages unless
                    the value 00 is entered at NITHLF: (which
                    see).

NOTE TO USERS OF WORDSTAR Revision 3.3 and
                    later:  This feature may be customized at the
                    installation utility's FEATURES menu by
                    entering option A and following the
                    subsequent instructions.

WORDSTAR INITIALIZATION FEATURES

LABEL     # OF BYTES                   DESCRIPTION & USE

          INITPF:        1    The bytes entered at this label and the
following 19 bytes control the initial PAGE FORMAT which WordStar
                    will use in displaying PAGE BREAKS during
                    editing of a file and for PAGINATION DURING
                    PRINTOUT of the file. DOT COMMANDS properly
                    inserted in a file will override these
                    values, both during edit and at print time.

The value entered at this label (i.e.,
                    INITPF: without an offset or with the offset
                    +0) sets the default LINE HEIGHT in 48th's of
                    an inch. If the value is changed at this
                    label it will be necessary to place the same
                    value in four other INITPF: locations:
                    INITPF:+4, INITPF:+8, INITPF:+C and
                    INITPF:+10. It is not relevant if you are
                    using a TeleType-like installation but may be
                    important when your WordStar is installed for
                    a Specialty (daisy wheel or Thimble) type
                    printer. It is normally a hexadecimal value
                    between 1 and FF which represents the line
                    height to be used in 1/48ths of an inch. For
                    instance, the value at INITPF: (or INITPF:+0)
                    is 08 for 8/48th's of an inch per line.  This
                    is the equivalent of the dot command .LH 8
                    and results in 66 single spaced lines per
                    page when using an 8 x 11 inch sheet of
                    paper.  It is also the preset value for a un-
                    modified WordStar.  Changing the value at
                    INITPF: to 10 (16 decimal) will result in 33
                    double spaced lines per 8 x 11 page. The same
                    result could be generated by entering the dot
                    command .LH 16 at the beginning of a file but
                    changing the value at INITPF: would make the
                    insertion of this dot command unnecessary. A
                    permament change of this default might be
                    indicated if a large part of all editing done
                    with your WordStar was required as double
                    spaced text.  Note that doubling the line
                    height value reduced the number of line per
                    page in half (i.e., 66 lines/page at 8/48th's
                    went to 33 lines/per page at 16/48th's). Note
                    also that a value placed in INITPF: (or
                    INITPF:+1 through INITPF:+18) must be entered
                    as the hexadecimal equivalent of the decimal
                    value). Changing this value may well require
                    recalculation of the value at INITPF:+2 (page
                    length in 48th of an inch).

LABEL     # OF BYTES                   DESCRIPTION & USE

          INITPF:+1      1    The value entered at this label and offset
(also refered to as a displacement) sets the numbers of lines per
                    page.  The preset value at INITPF:+1 is 42
                    which is the hexadecimal equivalent of 66.
                    Thus the "default" number of lines per page
                    in an unmodified WordStar is 66 lines/page.
                    For example, changing the value at INITPF:+1
                    to 48 will result in a default page length of
                    72 lines per page (48 hexadecimal is the
                    equivalent of 72 in decimal).  This change at
                    INITPF:+1 has exactly the same result as
                    inserting the dot command .PL 72  at the
                    beginning of a file. This permament modifica-
                    tion might be indicated where 8 X 14 (legal
                    or European) sized paper is normally used.
                    Changing this value may well require
                    recalculation of the value at INITPF:+2 (page
                    length in 48th of an inch).

NOTE TO USERS OF WORDSTAR Revision 3.3 and
                    later:  This feature may be customized at the
                    installation utility's FEATURES menu by

WORDSTAR INITIALIZATION FEATURES

LABEL     # OF BYTES                   DESCRIPTION & USE

          INITPF:+2      2    The two byte value entered at INITPF:+2 must
be the paper length of a page in 48th's of an inch, least signi-
                    ficant byte first.  This can be calculated
                    fairly simply by multiplying the number of
                    lines per page (see INITPF:+2) by the line
                    height in 48th's of an inch (see INITPF:).
                    An unmodified WordStar has a pre-installed
                    hexadecimal value 210 installed in the two
                    bytes starting at INITPF:+2.  To get this
                    value, the preinstalled line height (at
                    INITPF:) of 8/48th's and the preinstalled
                    page length (at INITPF:+1) in lines were
                    multiplied together to get:    8 * 66 = 528

The hexadecimal equivalent of the decimal
                    value 528 is 210.  Note, however, that a
                    hexadecimal value 10 (the least significant
                    byte of 210) will appear at INITPF:+2 and the
                    value 02 (the most significant byte of the
                    value 210) will appear at INITPF:+3, i.e.,
                    you must reverse the order of the bytes of
                    this value when you enter it into INITPF:+2.
                    If you change the value at either INITPF:
                    (line height in 48th's of an inch) and/or the
                    value at INITPF:+1 (page length in lines) you
                    will probably have to change the values
                    contained in the two bytes starting at
                    INITPF:+2 as indicated above. For example, if
                    the line height in 48th's of an inch is left
                    unchanged (i.e., INITPF: remains as 8/48th's)
                    but the paper length value at the label
                    INITPF:+1 is increased to 72 lines/page (i.e,
                    the value at INITPF:+1 is changed from 42 to
                    48), the value starting at INITPF:+2 would be
                    recalculated as:

8 * 72 = 576

576 decimal is 240 in hexadecimal.  Therefore
                    you would be required to enter a 76 at
                    INITPF:+2 and a 05 at INITPF:+3 to properly
                    complete the page length modification.

NOTE TO USERS OF WORDSTAR Revision 3.3 and
                    later:  This feature is automatically
                    modified when any change to the number of
                    lines per page (i.e., INITPF:+1 which see) is
                    made via the FEATURES menu option M.

          INITPF:+5      1    The value entered at this label and offset
should be the number of lines desired for a TOP MARGIN.  This
                    value is preinstalled for 3 top margin lines.
                    Consequently the value to be found at this
                    label in an unmodified product is 03.  To
                    change the default top margin to five lines,
                    for example, you would need to change the
                    value at INITPF:+5 to 05.  This would have
                    precisely the same result as placing the dot
                    command .MT 5 at the beginning of a file.
                    When changing the default top (or  bottom)
                    margins, the total of top margins plus the
                    bottom margins when subracted  from the value
                    at page length in lines (INITPF:+1) must be a
                    positive number.  In addition, the positive
                    number which results from this calculation is
                    the number of lines of actual text which will
                    be printed at print time.  For instance, the
                    default value of 3 lines of top margin and 8
                    lines of bottom margin, when subtracted from
                    the default page length of 66 lines results
                    in a print area (i.e., an area where normal
                    text can be printed) of:

LABEL     # OF BYTES                   DESCRIPTION & USE

          INITPF:+5      1    By calculation, then, the printable text area
is 55 (continued)       lines in an unmodified WordStar when
     modifying dot commands are not used.  If the result of the
                    above calculation when perfomed with new
                    values entered at INITPF:+1 (page length in
                    lines), INITPF:+5 (top margin in lines)
                    and/or INITPF:+D (bottom margin in lines) is
                    a negative number, you will have to adjust
                    one or more of the new values to provide a
                    positive number.  Likewise, if the result of
                    your calculation does not result in a suf-
                    ficient number of text lines for your
                    requirements you will have to adjust one or
                    more of the values at INITPF:+1, INITPF:+5
                    and/or INITPF:+D.  Note that changes to these
                    values require an attendant change in the
                    calculated value representing the number of
                    lines for each area in 48th's of an inch.
                    These values immediately follow the height
                    in lines value (see INITPF:+6 for a
                    discussion of this value for TOP MARGIN).

LABEL     # OF BYTES                   DESCRIPTION & USE

          INITPF:+6      2    The two byte value entered at INITPF:+6 must
be the height of the TOP MARGIN in 48th's of an inch based on the
                    number of lines assigned to the top margin by
                    the value at INITPF:+5 and the line height in
                    48th's provided at INITPF:+8.  Note that the
                    value at INITPF:+8 should be the same value
                    entered at INITPF:, INITPF:+4, INITPF:+C and
                    INITPF:+10.  This can be calculated fairly
                    simply by multiplying the number of top
                    margins lines (see INITPF:+5) by the line
                    height in 48th's of an inch (see INITPF:+8 or
                    INITPF:).  An unmodified WordStar has a pre-
                    installed hexadecimal value 18 installed in
                    the two bytes starting at INITPF:+6.  To get
                    this value, the preinstalled line height (at
                    INITPF:) of 8/48th's and the preinstalled
                    lines for the top margin (at INITPF:+5) were
                    multiplied together to get:

8 * 3 = 24

The hexadecimal equivalent of the decimal
                    value 24 is 18.  Note, however, that a
                    hexadecimal value 18 (the least significant
                    byte of 210) will appear at INITPF:+2 while
                    the value 00 appears at INITPF:+3.  This is
                    valid since the value 18 must be provided as
                    a two byte entry and since 0018 is exactly
                    equivalent to 18 it is in this form that we
                    must enter the bytes.  In addition, we must
                    reverse the order of the bytes of this value
                    when they are entered at INITPF:+6 starting
                    with the second byte of the value. If you
                    change the value at either INITPF: (and
                    therefore the values at INITPF:+4, INITPF:+8,
                    INITPF:+C and INITPF:+10) and/or the value at
                    INITPF:+5 (margin top in lines) you will
                    probably have to change the values contained
                    in the two bytes starting at INITPF:+6 as
                    indicated above.

LABEL     # OF BYTES                   DESCRIPTION & USE

          INITPF:+6           For example, if the line height in 48th's of
an inch is (continued)       left unchanged (i.e., INITPF:
     remains as 8/48th's) but the top margin value at the label
                    INITPF:+5 is increased to 05 lines (i.e, the
                    value at INITPF:+5 is changed from 03 to 05),
                    the value starting at INITPF:+6 would be re-
                    calculated as:

8 * 5 = 40

40 decimal is 28 in hexadecimal.  Therefore
                    you would be required to enter a 28  at
                    INITPF:+6 and a 00 at INITPF:+7 to properly
                    complete the top margin modification.

NOTE TO USERS OF WORDSTAR Revision 3.3 and
                    later:  This feature is automatically
                    modified when the TOP MARGIN is changed via
                    the FEATURES menu option I (i.e., INITPF:+5
                    which see).

WORDSTAR INITIALIZATION FEATURES

LABEL     # OF BYTES                   DESCRIPTION & USE

          INITPF:+9      1    The value entered at this label establishes
the number of lines from the first line in the actual body of a
                    printed page's text to the line within the
                    TOP MARGIN above it at which any HEADER line
                    should be positioned.  To put this another
                    way, the value placed at this location
                    determines which of the lines assigned to the
                    top margin will be used to print the header
                    line.  In addition, this is determined by
                    counting UP FROM THE FIRST LINE ON A PAGE
                    THAT IS NOT PART OF THE TOP MARGIN TO THE
                    LINE IN THE TOP MARGIN TO BE USED FOR THE
                    HEADER.

It should be reasonably obvious, therefore,
                    that the value entered at this label is
                    dependent on the number of lines provided in
                    the Top Margin by the value at INITPF:+5 (and
                    INITPF:+6, 7 and 8). For instance, if the top
                    margin was assigned 3 lines at INITPF:+5 (as
                    is an unmodified WordStar), it would be a
                    mistake to enter a value of 05 at INITPF:+9
                    since, if we count up 5 lines from the first
                    line that isn't part of the top margin we
                    have moved through the top margin (which
                    ended at line three) and are two lines off
                    the top of the page.  Such mistakes can cause
                    extremely strange behavior from the
                    erroneously customized WordStar.  An
                    unmodified WordStar has a value of 02
                    preinstalled at INITPF:+9.  This value
                    provides that a header line (set with the dot
                    command .HE) will appear two lines into the
                    top margin (as counted from the bottom of the
                    top margin).  Another way of looking at this
                    is that, since the top margin is three lines
                    high, the header line will appear one line
                    from the top of the page.  Note that this is
                    only a way to look at it, however, and is not
                    the way to calculate the value to be entered
                    at INITPF:+9.

LABEL     # OF BYTES                   DESCRIPTION & USE

          INITPF:+A      2    The two byte value entered at INITPF:+A must
be the result of multiplying the number of lines entered at
                    INIPF:+9 by the line height in 48th's of an

                    INITPF:+4, INITPF:+8 or INITPF:+10).  In
                    essence the procedure is identical to the one
                    described for the label INITPF:+6 (i.e., Top
                    Margin in 48th's) except, of course, the
                    calculation involves INITPF:+9 and the line
                    height in 48th's of an inch.

LABEL     # OF BYTES                   DESCRIPTION & USE

          INITPF:+11     1    The value entered at this label represents
the number of lines from the first line that is not part of the
                    BOTTOM MARGIN to the line in the BOTTOM
                    MARGIN where a footer line (set with the dot
                    command .FO) will be placed.  In essence the
                    discussion of the value entered at the label
                    INITPF:+9 (i.e., Header Margin) holds here
                    except, of course, the line is counted down
                    into the bottom margin rather than up into
                    the top margin. Otherwise the same
                    instructions apply.  Also note that changing
                    the footing margin may be accomplished via
                    the dot command .FM x within a file instead
                    of or in addition to changing the byte values
                    at INITPF:+11 and INITPF:+12 and 13.

INITPF:+15     1    The byte entered at this label determines
whether WordStar will print in STANDARD (see INITPF:+15) or
                    ALTERNATE (see INITPF:+16) character width at
                    print time without inserting a modifying dot
                    command (Control-PA for alternate or Control-
                    PS for standard).  An unmodified WordStar
                    has a preinstalled value off 00 at this label
                    and will, therefore, always print in "stand-
                    ard" pitch (i.e., character width) until it
                    encounters a Control-PA in a file.  If the
                    value FF is entered at INITPF:+14, WordStar
                    will automatically print in "alternate"
                    character pitch until a Control-PS is en-
                    countered in a file.

LABEL     # OF BYTES                   DESCRIPTION & USE

          INITLM:        1    Enter a value at this label which represents
the left margin which you typically use in your document work.
                    It is used by word warp and paragraph reform
                    (Control-B) and the effective or observed
                    left margin will be the value you enter here
                    (in hexadecimal) plus 1. The left margin (and
                    the value at INITLM:) may, of course, be
                    modified during an edit via the Control-OL
                    command but a permanent modification of this
                    variable within WordStar may be indicated
                    where the default left margin at the first
                    column is rarely used. You many enter any
                    value from 00 through the value entered at
                    INITRM: (Initial Right Margin,which see)
                    minus 3.  An unmodified WordStar is pre-
                    installed with a 00 so that the observed
                    WordStar left margin on your terminal screen
                    will be column 1 (i.e., 00 + 1 = 01).  Note
                    that the value at INITLM: corresponds to the
                    left margin of the text when the file is
                    printed and not to the left margin of the
                    paper.  The paper's left margin is to the
                    left of the text left margin (i.e., the value
                    entered at INITLM:) by the number of columns
                    entered atINITPF:+18 (the COLUMN OFFSET
                    value, which see). Any value may be entered
                    at INITRM: so long as it does not exceed the
                    value entered at the label INITRM: minus 3.
                    For instance, if the pre-installed WordStar
                    right margin of 65 is left unchanged, the
                    right most (or maximum) left margin allowable
                    would be 61 (i.e., 64-3 = 61).  The mimimum
                    (or left most) left margin value which may be
                    entered at INITLM: is 00 which corresponds to
                    an observed left margin of 01 (i.e., 00 + 1 =
                    01) which is, as noted previously, the
                    default or pre-installed WordStar left
                    margin.

LABEL     # OF BYTES                   DESCRIPTION & USE

          INITRM:          1    Enter a value at this label which
represents theright margin which you typically use in your
                    document work.  It is used by word warp and
                    paragraph reform (Control-B) and the
                    effective or observed right margin will be
                    the value you enter here (in hexadecimal)
                    minus 1. The right margin (and the value at
                    INITRM:) may, of course, be modified during
                    an edit via the Control-OR command but a
                    permanent modification of this variable
                    within WordStar may be indicated where the
                    default right margin of 65 columns is rarely
                    used. You many enter any value from 02
                    through the value entered at WID: (Screen
                    Width, which see) minus 4.  An unmodified
                    WordStar is pre-installed with a 40
                    (hexadecimal equivalent of decimal 64) so
                    that the observed WordStar right margin on
                    your terminal screen will be column 65 (i.e.,
                    64 + 1 = 65).  Since most current screen
                    widths are typically 80 columns, the maximum
                    typical value which can be entered at this
                    label is 76 (80-4 = 76 or 4C hexadecimal).
                    If a value greater than the maximum value
                    allowed is entered, WordStar will
                    automatically adjust the RIGHT MARGIN to
                    WID:-4.  Given a screen width large enough,
                    the maximum value which may be entered at the
                    label INITRM: is 240 (F0H) which would result
                    in a right margin at column 241 and would
                    require a screen width of at least 244
                    columns.  It is also important to note that
                    the value at the label INITRM: is used by
                    MAILMERGE as the default right margin when
                    the "print time line forming" feature (.PF
                    ON) is enabled at print time.  This function
                    will dynamically reform material containing
                    variables to fit the right margin established
                    by the value at INITRM:.

LABEL     # OF BYTES                   DESCRIPTION & USE

          INITRM:       1     It is also appropriate to note in a
discussion of the (continued)       labels INITLM: and INITRM:
     that the page number is automatically centered between the
                    value provided at the label INITLM: and the
                    value at INITRM:.  Thus, in a unmodified
                    WordStar and prior to any modification of the
                    left or right margin with the Control-OL
                    and/or Control-OR commands, the page number
                    will be positioned at column 32 (i.e., 65-
                    1)/2 = 32).

INITSR:          1    Enter a value at this label that represents
the number of 48th's of an inch you wish the platen of your
                    printer to roll up or down when the Super or
                    Subscript commands (Control-PT or Control-PS)
                    are encountered in a file line.  The
                    super/subscript roll value may, of course, be
                    changed from within a file via the dot
                    command .SR x but permanent changes to your
                    WordStar may be indicated where the default
                    WordStar super/subscript roll value of
                    3/48th's of an inch is rarely acceptable in
                    everyday operation. The value at this label
                    is only of interest in a WordStar installed
                    for use of a Specialty printer (daisy,
                    thimble, letter quality, incremental, etc)
                    and can be ignored for Teletype-like
                    installations.

WORDSTAR INITIALIZATION FEATURES

LABEL     # OF BYTES                   DESCRIPTION & USE

          INITWF:+2      1    Enter an FF at this label to enable SOFT TABS
at the edit of a document file or until the first execution of a
                    Control-OV command by the operator.  FF is
                    the pre-installed value at the label
                    INITWF:+2 for an unmodified WordStar.  Enter
                    a  00 at this label to generate HARD TABS at
                    the edit of a document file or until the
                    first execution of a Control-OJ command by
                    the operator.  Normally one would prefer SOFT
                    TABS in a file which contains material to be
                    used in a document and HARD TABS in such non-
                    document files as program source code and,
                    perhaps, tabular material.

In order to make a decision in this matter,
                    however, it is essential to understand the
                    meaning of "hard" and "soft" tabs.  In many
                    circumstances, it is unnecessary to enter
                    actual spaces to move the terminal cursor or
                    print element (or head) of a printing device
                    to a specific location on the paper since a
                    character known as a TAB has been provided.
                    The tab character (known as a horizontal tab
                    and having the ASCII/HEX value 09) typically
                    provides that the print head or terminal
                    cursor is moved a specific number of spaces
                    (or space increments) to the right each time
                    the tab character is encountered.  What is
                    important to note is that no matter how many
                    spaces the tab character moves the cursor or
                    head, only one character (the TAB character)
                    is inserted in the file.  For instance, where
                    a hard horizontal tab character represents 8
                    spaces (as with WordStar's hard tabs), a
                    movement of the print head (or terminal
                    cursor) of eight spaces will be made even
                    though there is only one character imbedded
                    in the file (i.e., a 09 or tab). Obviously,
                    therefore, hard tabs will save significant
                    storage space where they are used since one
                    character (a TAB) is used to get the effect
                    which would otherwise require eight
                    characters (spaces). The soft tab, on the
                    other hand, allows the operator to move any
                    number of spaces on printer or terminal
                    screen but does so by inserting spaces when
                    the tab is entered.

          INITWF:+2           The soft tab is, therefore, a convenience to
the (continued)     operator rather than a storage saving device
     as is the case with the hard tab.  Because the soft tab
                    actually inserts spaces to achieve its
                    spacing function it is possible to allow the
                    operator to vary the "tab sets" anywhere
                    within the ruler line whereas with hard tabs
                    the single character must always represent
                    the same number of spaces.  The invariant
                    nature of hard tabbing is the source of the
                    term "hard" (i.e., unchangeable) when applied
                    to such a tab. In the same sense, the
                    variable spacing capability of the soft tab
                    is the source of the term "soft".
                    Note that the value at INITWF:+2 is dis-
                    regarded if the operator chooses to edit a
                    file in NON-DOCUMENT MODE since HARD TABS are
                    always used under this edit option.

          INITWF:+3      1    Enteran FF at this label to enable SOFT
HYPHEN ENTRY at the edit of a document file or until the first
                    execution of a Control-OE command by the
                    operator.  When SOFT-HYPHEN ENTRY is enabled
                    any hyphen typed will be interpreted as a
                    "soft" hyphen and will not be printed unless
                    it appears as the last character of any line.
                    FF is the pre-installed value at the label
                    INITWF:+3 for an unmodified WordStar. In
                    addition, while SOFT-HYPHEN ENTRY is enabled
                    a "HARD" or conventional hyphen may be
                    entered by typing a CONTROL-P followed by the
                    required hyphen. Enter an 00 at this label to
                    disable SOFT-HYPHEN ENTRY at the edit of a
                    document file or until the first execution of
                    a Control-OE command by the operator.  If
                    HYPHEN HELP is enabled (see INITWF:+4) it is
                    expected that most users will want SOFT-
                    HYPHEN ENTRY enabled (i.e., INITWF:+3 is FF).
                    The HYPHEN-HELP and SOFT-HYPHEN ENTRY
                    functions are, however, independently enabled
                    and disabled.

          INUTWF:+4           It may be desirable to disable HYPHEN HELP
for un-(continued)      interrupted execution of global paragraph
     reform (^Q^Q^B) as well as to suit user preference.
                    However, unless a strong preference for
                    WordStar operation without HYPHEN-HELP is
                    evident in daily operation, it is considered
                    perferable to use the CONTROL-OH command to
                    disable HYPHEN-HELP from the keyboard and to
                    leave the value at INITWF:+4 as the pre-
                    installed value of FF.

                    embedded in a document file via the CONTROL-P

                    practice of editing a WordStar document with
                    the display of print commands suppressed is
                    one that should be avoided due to the high
                    probability that unseen print controls will
                    be accidentally overwritten or inadvertantly
                    moved from their intended location during a
                    block move, copy or delete.  Consequently,
                    although the user may choose to set INITWF:+5
                    to 00, it is considered a very poor choice
                    and is not recommended.

LABEL     # OF BYTES                   DESCRIPTION & USE

          INITWF:+7       1   Enter an FF at this label to enable DYNAMIC
PAGE BREAK DETERMINATION at the edit of a document  file.  Unlike
                    the other INITWF: flags, INITWF:+7 cannot be
                    controlled via a command issued at the
                    keyboard. When Dynamic Page Break
                    Determination and Page Break Display (see
                    INITWF:+8) are both enabled, WordStar will
                    provide visual feedback of the point at which
                    a page will end by displaying a line of the
                    character supplied at PAGFIL: (which see) and
                    display the current cursor position as the
                    PAGE NUMBER, the line number from the
                    beginning of the page and the column number
                    from the left most column of the screen.  It
                    is important to note that so long as Page
                    Break Determination is enabled (i.e., the
                    value at INITWF:+7 is FF) and irrespective of
                    whether or not Page Break display is enabled,
                    WordStar will flag the page break location in
                    the text file by setting a character's high-
                    order bit.    FF is the pre-installed value
                    at the label INITWF:+7 in an unmodified
                    WordStar. Enter a 00 at this label to disable
                    Dynamic Page Break Determination at the edit
                    of a document file.  If you are a StarIndex
                    user you should be aware that proper
                    operation of StarIndex depends on the high-
                    order bit flag which Dynamic Page Break
                    Determination places in the WordStar document
                    file.  Thus it would be unwise to disable
                    page break deternination were StarIndex an
                    issue.  Programmer's who write program's in
                    DOCUMENT mode to avail themselves of the TAB
                    capability should disable page break
                    determination by entering a 00 at INITWF:+7.
                    This will prevent the occurance of assembler
                    (or complier) errors that often result when
                    the high-order bit flag is encountered in a
                    source file.  Note, however, that accidental
                    invocation of the Control-B function or Word-
                    Wrap will have the same effect.  Programmers
                    would be advised to disable WORD-WRAP (enter
                    a 00 at INITWF:) as well as page break
                    determination where it is desired to develop
                    programs in WordStar's DOCUMENT MODE.  Users
                    of WordStar Revision 3.0 and earlier should
                    also note that the Reform Paragraph command
                    (Control-B) is not disabled and care should

          INITWF:+8      1    Enter an FF at this label to enable PAGE
BREAK DISPLAY at the edit of a document file or until the first
                    execution of a Control-OP command by the
                    operator.  When Page Break display is
                    enabled, WordStar will provide visual
                    feedback of the point at which a page will
                    end by displaying a line of the character
                    supplied at PAGFIL: (which see).  In
                    addition, the current cursor position will be
                    displayed as the PAGE NUMBER, the line number
                    from the beginning of the page and the column
                    number from the left most column of the
                    screen.  FF is the pre-installed value at the
                    label INITWF:+8 and a hyphen is the pre-
                    installed character at PAGFIL: used to create
                    the page break line in an unmodified
                    WordStar. Enter a 00 at this label to disable
                    PAGE BREAK DISPLAY at the edit of a document
                    file or until the first execution of a
                    Control-OP command by the operator.  When
                    Page Break display is disabled via permanent
                    installation of a 00 at INITWF:+7 (or via the
                    Control-OP command), the current cursor
                    position will be given as the character
                    number from the beginning of the file (FC =

                    File Character), the number of lines from
                    the beginning of the file (FL = file lines)
                    and the column number from the leftmost
                    column on the screen. Note that the
                    suppression of page break display does not
                    disable the "dynamic page break
                    determination" mechanism.  If you write
                    programs in DOCUMENT-MODE it is important to
                    note that WordStar will set the highorder bit
                    of the character of a page to flag a page
                    break.  This may cause assembler (or
                    compiler) errors and, therefore, it is wise
                    to either use NONDOCUMENT MODE or to be sure
                    and turn off DYNAMIC PAGE BREAK DETERMINATION
                    via permanent installation of a 00 at
                    INITWF:+7 (which see).

WORDSTAR INITIALIZATION FEATURES

LABEL     # OF BYTES                   DESCRIPTION & USE

          INITWF:+9      1    Enter a value at this label which equals the
line spacing at which you wish your text displayed on the
                    terminal screen.  Enter a 01 to display (and
                    print) single spaced text, 02 for doubled
                    spaced text, etc.  Entering a byte at this
                    label is equivalent to executing a Control-OS
                    command and entering the spacing desired to
                    the resultant prompt.
                     Note, however, that printed text spacing and displayed text
                    spacing can be controlled independently.  It
                    is worthwhile to observe that a line spacing
                    of 01 (the pre-installed value in an
                    unmodified WordStar) allows the maximum text
                    to be displayed on screen at one time.  The
                    line spacing at print time may be
                    independently controlled via the .LH x dot
                    command with proper page break determination
                    being maintained so that page breaks dis-
                    played on screen will be correct for the
                    print time spacing even though the line
                    spacing on screen is different.  A typical
                    example would be a case where a document must
                    be printed in doubled spaced format.  The
                    operator could, of course, change line
                    spacing and enter the text in double spaced
                    format.  The alternative would be to set the
                    command .LH 16 (for 16/48th's of an inch
                    between lines which is double the default of
                    8/16th's) at the beginning of the text file
                    and simply enter text in single spaced
                    format.  At print time the text will be
                    double spaced but during entry the operator
                    will be able to see twice as many lines on
                    screen as would have been the case if the
                    line spacing had been changed to 02 via
                    either the Control-OS command or by
                    permanently modifying the value at INITWF:+9
                    to 02.  For more information regarding the
                    .LH command refer to your WordStar User's
                    Guide.  If you wish to change the default
                    (pre-installed) value which is exhibited by
                    WordStar for the .LH command refer to the
                    discussion of labels INITPF: through
                    INITPF:+18 in this appendix.

DOTCHR:          1    This label always contains the character
which, when placed in the first column of a text file line, will
                    be interpreted as a "command line".  Such
                    lines do not print and if followed by a valid
                    WordStar "dot command" will effect a
                    prescribed action when the text is printed.
                    An unmodified WordStar is pre-installed with
                    a period or "dot" (ASCII 2E hex) character
                    from which WordStar's "dot commands" derive
                    their name.  This character may be changed to
                    suit unusual circumstances or the user's
                    whims.  Selections for this character should
                    be made carefully since word-wrap will, on
                    occasion, place the selected character in the
                    first column of a line, thus rendering this
                    line unprintable.  Selection of a character
                    that is used frequently in everyday text
                    would, therefore, result in an unacceptably
                    high frequency of suppressed text lines.

BLNCHR:          1    This label always contains the character
which, when placed in a WordStar text file via a Control-P
                    prefix, will act as a "hard" or "NON-BREAK
                    SPACE".  Such spaces are not used by the
                    microspace justification mechanism of either
                    Word-Wrap or Paragraph Reform to achieve
                    right justification. Thus, the special
                    condition 2 X 4 will not be distorted by
                    microspace if the character at this label is
                    inserted as the space between the 2 and the X
                    and the X  and the 4. In a unmodified
                    WordStar the characater ^O (ASCII 0F hex) is
                    pre-installed at this label but it may be
                    changed to adjust for special circumstances.

                    Be aware, however, that only ^K and ^U are
                    effectively unassigned since all other
                    control characters are used as called out in
                    the Control-P Prefix Menu or serve as special
                    cases (such as Control-PL which enters a
                    "hard" form feed).

DOTSON:          1    Enter a 00 at this label to disable all
dynamic interpretation of commands signaled by the presence of
                    the character at the label DOTCHR: (which
                    see) in the first column of a text line.  An
                    unmodified WordStar has an FF installed at
                    this label (and a period installed at the
                    label DOTCHR:) so that the appearance of a
                    dot (or period) in the first column of a text
                    line will result in a pre-defined action at
                    print time as well as appearance of the '?'
                    in the flag column when an unrecognized dot
                    command appears on a line and proper page
                    break is displayed as required for dot
                    commands which affect page format (see
                    INITWF:+5 and INITWF:+6).  Entering an FF at
                    this label will disable dynamic inter-
                    pretation of dot commands at print time as

HZONE:           1    The value at this label determines the
maximum number of columns to the left of the right margin within
                    which the last full word on a line may end
                    without a hyphenation stop occuring during
                    paragraph reform. The value at the label
                    HZONE: in an unmodified WordStar is pre-
                    installed as 04.  This will allow hyphenation
                    help to suggest hyphen insertion when and if
                    a word ends within four columns of the right
                    margin. The rule of thumb for the value

                    increase for fewer hyphen stops or decrease

                    only has effect when the value at the label

VOWTAB:          5    The five bytes starting at this label serve
to identify characters that may be either vowels or consonants
                    and is used by WordStar's HYPHEN HELP
                    function in determining where to position
                    the cursor prior to prompting the operator
                    for hyphen insertion.  In an unmodified
                    WordStar, VOWTAB: is pre-installed with the
                    characters 'Y', '[', ']', '{' and '}'.  In
                    English, the character 'Y' may be either a
                    consonant or a vowel.  The other four pre-
                    installed characters often correspond to
                    accented vowels in some European languages.
                    (Also see INITWF:+3, INIWF:+4, HZONE:,

NONCON:        9    The nine bytes starting at this label serve
to identify characters that are always vowels (i.e., are never
                    consonants) and is used by WordStar's HYPHEN
                    HELP function in determining where to
                    position the cursor prior to prompting the
                    operator for hyphen insertion. In an
                    unmodified WordStar, the NONCON: (NON-
                    CONsonant) table is pre-installed with the
                    five characters 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O' and 'U'
                    which are the vowels in English.  The vowel
                    table characters starting at the label
                    NONCON: are manipulated as a logical
                    continuation of the characters starting at
                    the label VOWTAB: (which see) and the final
                    character of a string of characters composed
                    of either or both NONCON: and/or VOWTAB: must
                    end in a 00 byte. Thus it is important to
                    note that the maximum number of characters
                    for either VOWTAB: and/or NONCON: is, in
                    fact, not the sum of bytes provided for by
                    VOWTAB: and NONCON: (i.e., 5+9 = 14) but is
                    the sum of VOWTAB: and NONCON: minus the
                    terminating byte 00 (i.e., (5 + 9) - 1 =
                    0DH).

MARKS:+5       10   The ten characters entered starting at this
label are used by WordStar to mark "places" set gby the operator
                    via the CONTROL-Kn command where 'n' is a
                    number between 0 and 9.  In an unmodified
                    WordStar the characters 0 through 9 (ASCII
                    30H through 39H) are pre-installed starting
                    at this label but any ASCII characters may be
                    substituted for any (or all) of the these
                    characters.

PODBLK:+1      1    Enter an 00 at this label to cause the
printer to advance to the next page (sheet of paper) by sending
                    the required number of line feeds if the
                    operator types anything but 'Y' (Yes) to the
                    prompt "USE FORM FEEDS". This is the pre-
                    installed value at the label PODBLK:+1 in an
                    unmodified WordStar.  Enter an FF at this
                    label to cause the printer to advance to the
                    next page by sending a FORM FEED character
                    (ASCII 0CH) to the printer when the operator
                    types anything but 'N' (No) to the prompt
                    "USE FORM FEEDS".  The use of Form Feeds may
                    be necessary with some peripherals such as
                    Sheet Feeders.  The user may also find that
                    use of Form Feeds results in faster print
                    operation where the printer recognizes the
                    Form Feed character and operation is
                    acceptable.

Note that it is possible to suppress the
                    appearance of the prompt "USE FORM FEEDS"
                    entirely if it is desirable to eliminate the
                    prompt because the use of line feeds is an
                    option which is never used or is an option
                    which is always used. For information
                    regarding this option see the label NOUFF: in
                    this installation area.

PODBLK:+2      1    Enter an 00 at this prompt to enable page
formatting at print time if the operator types anything but 'Y'
                    (Yes) to the prompt "SUPPRESS PAGE
                    FORMATTING". This is the pre-installed value
                    at the label PODBLK:+2 in an unmodified
                    WordStar.  Enter an FF at this label to cause
                    WordStar to output text without executing
                    page formatting commands at print time if
                    the operator types anything but 'N' (No) to
                    the prompt "USE FORM FEEDS". It should be
                    noted that when page formatting is
                    suppressed, all dot commands are treated as
                    printable text (i.e., are ignored as normal
                    WordStar commands) including those dot
                    commands which are specific to MailMerge
                    and/or StarIndex.  In addition it should be
                    noted that when output to disk file is done
                    with page formatting suppressed, any control
                    characters imbedded in the text will not be
                    expanded to their associated printer control
                    strings but will appear in the resultant
                    print output file  as they appeared in the
                    original text file.

KEYBOARD CUSTOMIZATION AREAS

The Keyboard Customization areas that follow are used to
interpret commands input during the use of WordStar.  The command
character portion of the entries may be altered to change the
keys used for commands.  Commands may be freely changed between
single and double keystrokes or to a different prefix (first key)
for a two-keystroke command.  However, the same key may not be
used both as a single-key command and as the first (prefix) key
of a two-key command.  Duplicate entries are acceptable.
Consequently you may add a new key or key pairs for an existing
function without deleting the old command by using the extra four
byte entries provided starting at the label XTAB:.

You may also change the existing command keys for any
     function in one of the three existing sets of command areas
     by changing the pre-installed command characters.  However,
     the same rules apply in the case of changing existing
     commands as do to adding alternate command sequences to the
     existing command sequences.

Each area consists of four bytes:

BYTE 0/:        This byte contains the first character of a two
character control command (such as a Control-K/0/BH for the mark
               beginning of block command) or the only character
               of a single character command (such as Control-
               V/16H for the inert ON/OFF toggle).  Command
               characters in this byte must be control codes (0/1-
               1F HEX).

BYTE 1:        This byte contains either a zero if the previous
byte is a single character control command (like Control-V) or it
               contains the second byte of a two byte command

                               71






               (e.g., Control-B/0/2H for the second characters of
               the mark beginning of block command).  A character
               entered in this byte may be any ASCII character
               but will always be converted to upper case (if a
               lower case letter is entered) and then to a
               control-code.  Consequently both upper and lower
               case letters inserted in this byte are handled as
               the corresponding control character (e.g., either
               the letter 'B' or the letter 'b' in this byte will
               be used as a Control-B/0/2H)

BYTES 3,4:     These two bytes contain an address which is used
by WordStar to execute the action associated with the control
               character or characters in the previous two bytes
               when they are input by the operator.  It is rarely
               advisable to change this address.

Note that if this address is 256 (FFH) or less it is used by
     WordStar as an index to a string of text which is to be
     displayed on the terminal's screen.  This will always be
     evident when you display bytes 3 and 4 since the third byte
     in such cases will always be 0/0/.































                               72






     This fact makes it impossible to use a command sequence to
     jump directly to a user-implemented subroutine  installed at
     MORPAT: since its address is typically below 256 (e.g., 2E0/
     in WordStar Revision 3.0/ and earlier and 2CBH in WordStar
     3.3).  You may, however, use a direct jump to routines
     installed over unused printer drivers (see the Printer
     Drivers section of this chapter) or to routines installed
     beginning at the location pointed to by PBGMEM: (see the
     TERMINAL INSTALLATION Section of this chapter) to overcome
     this problem.

The WordStar Keyboard Customization area is divided into
     five sets of areas:

THE NO-FILE BEING EDITED COMMAND AREAS

Areas which are accessed by adding an offset to the label NOFTAB:
are used to interpret keystrokes entered at the menu when no file
is being edited (i.e., the OPENING MENU in WordStar 3.3).

THE EDITING FILE COMMANDS AREAS

Areas which are accessed by adding an offset to the label VTAB:
are used to interpret keystrokes entered during the time that a
file is being edited.

THE MAILMERGE COMMAND AREAS

Areas which are accessed by adding an offset to the label FPTAB:
are used to interpret any special keystrokes that are available
during the print of a file via the MAILMERGE utility (e.g.,
CONTROL-P to stop print, CONTROL-Z to scroll the terminal's
screen up, etc).

THE EXPANSION COMMAND AREAS

Areas which are accessed by adding an offset to the label XTAB:
may be used to implement additional keystrokes to cause WordStar
to execute various functions while retaining the effectiveness of
the normal commands.

PROMPT CONTROL COMMAND AREAS

These areas provide selected keystrokes used when prompts are
displayed which require responses, such as the "FILE NAME?",
"FIND?".







                               73






ORGANIZATION OF KEYBOARD CUSTOMIZATION DATA

The following keyboard customization areas are organized in
     the following manner:

LABEL:+OFFSET

     To the extreme left of each area's entry is a label name
(NOFTAB:, VTAB:, etc) followed by a colon, a plus sign and an
hexadecimal number.  This is the exact sequence of characters you
must enter at the WordStar Installation utility's Label Patcher
prompt to get to the command area described for the label/offset
of interest. (See LABL-1 through LABL-7 for more information
regarding use of the Label Patcher.)

NOTE:     WordStar 3.3 has an enhanced Label Patcher utility that
will require you to place the colon before the label rather than
          after it, i.e., :LABEL+OFFSET.

Control xx

To the immediate right of the label:+offset entry is the
     word Control (or Ctrl which is a contraction of Control)
     followed by one or two letters and numbers (xx).  This is
     the name of the characters which are installed in the first
     two bytes of this area in an unmodified WordStar.

(xx,yy)

To the right of the name of the pre-installed
          characters and enclosed in parenthesis are the
          hexadecimal values of these control codes.  Since the
          easiest method of entering numbers with the Label
          Patcher is to enter them in hexadecimal, the codes are
          presented in this notation. (If you are using a
          different method and need to know the decimal, binary
          or ASCII equivalents refer to the table at the end of
          this section.)


ACTION DESCRIPTION

Finally, at the extreme right of each area is a description
     of the action that will occur when the area's pre-installed
     control characters are entered.

Note that bytes 3 and 4 are not provided in the entry for
     any area and that it is, in fact, these two bytes that
     actually determine what will happen when the associated
     keystrokes (i.e., control codes) are encountered in the
     input from a keyboard.  Since these values can be identified
     relatively easily as outlined in steps 2 and 3 in the

                               74






     procedure under EXPANSION COMMAND AREAS and since they are
     unique in any given revision of WordStar, they were omitted
     to help make the information more revision independent.

THE NO-FILE BEING EDITED COMMAND AREAS

All the commands in the areas which are accessed by adding an
offset to the label NOFTAB: are single keystroke (single
character) commands and are effective when the OPENING MENU is
being displayed (i.e, no file is yet opened for edition).

The letters A,B,C,G,J,K, and Q are the letters currently
     unused as prefix characters (Control-U is the interrupt
     character and the letters I and T are reserved).  Remember
     that WordStar does not distinquish between the upper, lower
     and control cases for each of these letters so that, in
     fact, there are only 9 characters available for use.  If, in
     the unlikly case that you need more characters than 9, you
     may use the unused Control codes discussed previously to
     bring the total number of single character commands codes to
     a total of 12.

THE EDITING FILE COMMAND AREAS

A few of the following Editing Command Areas do not have the
     same offsets for WordStar Revision 3.3 as for WordStar
     revision 3.0/.  In such cases, two label and offset values
     are given; the upper one should be used when modifying a
     WordStar with a revision 3.0/ and the lower one should be
     used when modifying a revision 3.3 WordStar.

Also note that this customization area has been
          subdivided into the:

Single Keystroke Command Customization Areas
               Control-Q Command Customization Areas
               Control-K Command Customization Areas
               Control-O Command Customization Areas
               Control-J Command Customization Areas

and that within each of these areas the
                         commands are presented in alphabetical
                         order by the second character  of the
                         two character command.  Also be aware
                         that commands ending in a number are
                         provided at the end of the table.

EXPANSION COMMAND CUSTOMIZATION AREAS

Redundant entries using your favorite keys may be entered in the
following spaces if you wish to keep the original entry so that
the original keys still operate.

In creating additional entries, copy the address portion
carefully from one of the previous keyboard customization areas.
The following steps outline the necessary procedure for
implementing redundant command sequences:

1.   Identify the installation area in which the standard command
is to be found (i.e., NO-FILE, FILE BEING EDITED or MAILMERGE
     area) and locate the label and offset which will allow the
     Label Patcher of WordStar's installation utility to access
     the area of interest.  (see LABL-1 through LABL-7 for
     information regarding the Label Patcher)

2.   Enter this address and offset when prompted by the Label
Patcher and type a carriage return.   If you have entered it
     correctly the Label Patcher will display a line of sixteen
     bytes and ask you if this is the location you want to
     change.

3.   Record on a piece of paper the third and fourth bytes from
the left end of the displayed string of bytes.

4.   Enter 'N' (for No this isn't the area I want to modify) at
the Label Patcher's prompt.

5.   Select one of the EXPANSION COMMAND Areas and enter the
label XTAB: followed by the offset given for that area.  For
     example, if you have not previously installed an alternate
     command character sequence you might just as well use the
     first expansion command area so you would enter :XTAB+0/ at
     the prompt.

6.   When the Label Patcher prompts for whether this is the
location you wish to modify type a 'Y' (for Yes this is the
     area).

7.   Now enter the byte (or bytes) of your alternate command
character string.  If you only have one byte to enter, enter that
     byte first followed by two carriage returns to skip the next
     byte (but be sure that the second byte is zero in this
     case).

8.   Now enter the two bytes you recorded from the command area
of step 3 in the order that they appeared on the screen (from
     left to right).

If you have followed these steps carefully you have

                               92






     effectively installed a command string which, in addition to
     the normal WordStar command string, will execute the command
     that you require.

You must remember, however, that you cannot use any of the
     existing prefix characters of a two key command sequence in
     an attempt to implement a one-key aternate command within
     Editing File Command Areas (the only command areas which use
     two keystroke commands).  Since the letters J, K, O, P, and
     Q are used as the first character in double character
     commands do not attempt to use these particular characters
     as the first character of an alternate file-being-edited
     (VTAB:) single character command.
     If your keyboard can generate a Control-\ (control-backslash
     = 1CH), Control-] (Control right bracket = 1DH), Control-^
     (Control up-arrow = 1EH) or a Control-_ (Control-underscore
     = 1FH), you may use these characters to implement either
     single or double key alternatives to existing command key-
     strokes.

MAILMERGE COMMAND CUSTOMIZATION AREAS

The MailMerge Command Areas are used to interpret keystrokes
entered during the execution of MailMerge.

_________________________________________
FPTAB:+0/0/       Control-P  (10/,0/0/)  Stop MailMerge print
operation

FPTAB:+0/4       Control-Z  (1A,0/0/)  Scroll MailMerge disk
directory up

FPTAB:+0/8      Control-W   (17,0/0/)  Scroll MailMerge disk
directory down

FPTAB:+0/C      Control-V   (16,0/0/)

FPTAB:+10/                  (0/0/)     Must be 0/0/. Do not change



PROMPT CONTROL COMMAND CUSTOMIZATION AREAS

These areas provide selected control characters used in the line
input routine which accepts responses to the "FILE NAME?",
"FIND?", and other prompts which end in a question mark.  Note
that, unlike earlier areas, these areas allow for only single
keystroke entries, i.e., only one byte per label is provided.  In
addition there is no need to concern oneself about an a 3rd and
fourth byte which, in other areas, contains an index or address.
These areas do not require these items.

CLCHR:           Control-S    (13)   This is the character which,
when entered at a prompt such as "FILE NAME?" or "FIND?" will
                                   cause the cursor to move left
                                   and delete a previously
                                   entered character (i.e.,
                                   cursor left).  Althought any
                                   character should work here,
                                   you will usually want it to be
                                   consistent with similar
                                   editing commands in the
                                   NOFTAB: and VTAB: areas.
                                   Consequently, if you change
                                   the value at VTAB:+18 and
                                   Vtab:+14, you will want to

LITCHR:          Control-P    (10/)   When this character is
entered at a prompt it indicates that the character that
                                   imediately follows it should
                                   be entered exactly as entered
                                   (literally) even if it is
                                   otherwise a valid command
                                   character.  This allows the
                                   operator to do such things as
                                   serach for control characters
                                   such as ^P, ^A etc.

DIRCH:           Control-F    (0/6)   If directory is OFF when a
command prompt is displayed (such as "Name of file to delete?" on
                                   entry of the Control-KJ com-
                                   mand) entering this character
                                   will turn the directory ON
                                   until completion of the
                                   command.

DIRCH:+1       Control-Z    (1A)   If directory is on when a
command prompt is displayed (or has been temporarily turned ON
                                   with the character at DIRCH:)
                                   entry of this character will
                                   scroll the directory display
                                   upwards.

DIRCH:+2       Control-W    (17)   If directory is on when a
command prompt is displayed (or has been temporarily turned ON
                                   with the character at DIRCH:)
                                   entry of this character will
                                   scroll the directory display
                                   downwards.


STPCHR:          Control-U    (15)   This is a special command
character which causes the interruption of any command being
                                   executed when it is entered.
                                   It must match the entry at
                                   VTAB:+12C.

ERELCH:          ESCAPE       (1B)   This is the character that
must be entered after any error and after interruption of an
                                   ongoing command via the
                                   character at STPCHR:
                                   (VTAB:+12C) in orer to
                                   continue editing.  This is
                                   normally installed as an
                                   ESCAPE character.
