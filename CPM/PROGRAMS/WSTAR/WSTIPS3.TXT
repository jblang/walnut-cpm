WORDSTAR TIP

How can you avoid losing your file when WordStar comes up with ERROR
#12, DISK FULL, message when you are in the edit mode.

Prevention is the best cure.  When you revise a text, remember that
WordStar needs room for its "BAK" files: if there is not enough room for
your disk for both the revised file and its 'BAK' file, make room before
you edit.  If, however, you get caught in edit with ERROR #12, DISK FULL
message, all is not necessarily lost.  Press the ESCAPE key, as WordStar
directs.  Unless you get another ERROR #12 message, you can possibly
save your file.  Type "^KF" to bring up the disk directory.  To make
additional space on your disk, delete any file you can spare by typing a
"^KJ filename.ext".  If you still need more space, use ^KO to copy files
to another drive, then delete them from the full disk.  If you have a
full WordStar disk to one drive and a full disk of text files in the
other, note that you can make some space on the WordStar disk by
deleting WINSTALL.COM, WS.INS, WSMSGS, assuming of course, that you have
backup copies (of these programs).  Since '^KF' is a toggle, you can
remove the disk directory from screen by typing it once again when you
have cleared enough space on your disk.
