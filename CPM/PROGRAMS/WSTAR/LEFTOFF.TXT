RETURNING TO WHERE YOU LEFT OFF

(Tricks on how to find where you left off editing)

The double dot command can be used in many ways.  Last month I
suggested using it to keep a record of what revision you were
working on, or even a cumulative history of your editing a file. 
You can also use these commands to mark where you left off during
an interrupted editing session.

Just leave command giving pertinent information that you can (1)
remember and (2) find again with a search command.  It really
helps if you have chosen something unique, so your search will
find what you want the first time, every time.  I always think up
something complicated like "last edit 4/21/87" and then can never
find it because I can't remember the clever term I used.  You
need something quick and easy (so you don't waste time or
misspell it) and memorable.

It might be useful to leave yourself a note at the top of the
file telling you what the marker actually is.  Then it will
always be there to copy.  Also, remember that your search doesn't
have to be for the whole entry.  You can use "last edit 4/21/87
&&" and just search for the &&, assuming that you don't fill up
your text with double ampersands.
