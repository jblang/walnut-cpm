  MICROPRO ANNOUNCED UPDATE OF WORDSTAR - CP/M EDITION RELEASE 4
             CP/M Update Offers Over 100 Enhancements

 SAN RAFAEL, Calif., July 23, 1987 - MicroPro International
Corporation (MPRO/NASDAQ) today announced that an updated version
of WordStar for CP/M microcomputers will begin shipping in
mid-August.  WordStar, originally released for CP/M
microcomputers, is the most widely-used word processing software
for microcomputers.  Currently, MicroPro is celebrating its "3
millionth-product-shipped" milestone.  WordStar is widely used by
writers, businesses, corporations of all sizes and governmental
agencies around the world.

      "WordStar, CP/M Edition, Release 4, offers more than 100
enhancements over the current CP/M version, while maintaining the
look and feel of the user interface that has become a word
processing standard as well as a standard for many other types of
microcomputer applications," said MicroPro president and CEO Leon
Williams.

      "MicroPro has a very special relationship with our CP/M
customers.  WordStar was originally release for CP/M machines in
1979 long before the industry adopted MS-DOS as the standard
operating system.  We realize that we got our start with CP/M
users and we want to assure them that we will continue to provide
them with access to the latest technology.  The `New' MicroPro is
committed to providing regular product updates for all our
customers, including those who use WordStar on CP/M systems,"
said Williams.

       WordStar, CP/M Edition, Release 4 will be priced at $295
and will be available in retail stores in September.  Release 4
contains improved versions of the WORD Plus spelling checker,
developed by San Diego-based Software Heaven Inc., and MailMerge
and a new, easier to use indexing system.

 New Features

       "Early this year, we conducted a survey to determine what
features CP/M users wanted in an upgrade.  The response was
overwhelming.  Letters and phone calls poured into MicroPro.
Based on the feedback we added more than 100 new features to the
CP/M version of WordStar," said Williams.

       Among the new features CP/M users requested and will find
in WordStar, CP/M Edition, Release 4 are: "Go-to page," stored
ruler lines, new 61,000-word dictionary (dictionary size may be
smaller depending on hardware), programmable macros, an "Undo"
command, built-in four function calculator, user number path
support, onscreen bold and underline (available on most
hardware), function keys (depending on hardware), laser printing
capability, and improved speed throughout the program.  The
product has been designed to support floppy-based and hard
disk-based systems and to take maximum advantage of available
system memory resources.

       WordStar, CP/M Edition, Release 4 includes free 90
day-warranty support.  Ninety days from the date of purchase (or
