		Addenda to PUBLIC Article in DDJ
11/18/84

Since the publication of the article, a minor bug in the PUBLIC.ASM
file has been drawn to our attention.  This causes it to refuse
to make files larger than 512K PUBlic.  The correction is noted
in the source code contained on this disk.


To use the relocater contained on this disk, simply run the following:-

RELPUBLC<CR>

and you will be prompted to give the address of the start of your BIOS.
You can find this address simply by running DDT and inspecting
location zero.

e.g.

DDT<CR>
d0,F<CR>

the address formed by location 0002 and 0001 points to the warrm
boot jump which is at BIOS+3.  The number you should enter to the relocator
is location 0002 followed by two zeros. (i.e. if you get the
following display from DDT

0000 C3 03 EA .. .. .. .. etc

then you would enter

	EA00

to the relocator.)

The relocator will produce a file called PUBPATCH.HEX which is a standard
Intel format hex file which can be merged with your copy of CP/M
in the manner described in the article.  Note that numbers larger
than 0FFFFH wrap,  so for the above system with the BIOS at
0EA00H the offset would be 3580H.

	CCPBASE_MEMORY	= 0EA00H - 01600H = 0D400H
        CCPBASE_IMAGE	= 00980H
	

	0D400H+03580H	= 0980H	(after wrapping)
