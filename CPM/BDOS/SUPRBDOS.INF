
The SUPRBDOS program as modified by Benjamin Ho has always looked
interesting to me, but I've never been able to get it to work on
my system.   I've finally succeeded, and perhaps my experiences
will be able to help someone else.


NOTES:    1.  On the Northstar Advantage, the SYSGEN does not
    take a file as an argument, so standard Kaypro installation
    can't be used.  Manual installation is required with some
    minor modifications.
2.  On the Northstar Advantage, the  <BdosMemAddr>  is DF00.
    The SYSGEN image is at 1D00.  The offset thus is 3E00.
    Most users should be able to find their corresponding
    addresses using the guide found in SUPRDOS2.LBR.


SYMPTOMS of the original installation which didn't work:
1.  All CCP functions worked fine (DIR, TYPE, ERA, SAVE, USER)
    including functions that took a file as an argument.
2.  Any attempt at running a file from disk (STAT, PIP, etc)
    fell into a black hole.


The MODIFICATIONS that finally did the trick:
1.  Modify the range of bdos that gets filled with zeroes.
    WAS:   f <BdosFileAddr>  <BdosFileAddr+$0E00>  0
    IS:    f <BdosFileAddr>  <BdosFileAddr+$0E00-1>  0
2.  Carefully note the serial number and patch back in after
    having overlayed the SYSGEN image with DOS.HEX.


The final steps in their exact sequence were:
1.  Create a one line ORG.DAT.  Specifically:  org  0df00h
2.  Create the file DOS.HEX using Z80MR on DOS.AZM & DOS?.MAC
3.  A>sysgen
    SOURCE DRIVE NAME (OR RETURN TO SKIP):       1
    DESTINATION DRIVE NAME (RETURN TO REBOOT):   <ret>
4.  A>ddt                    (original DDT only, *not* DDTZ)
     -f1D00  2AFF  0          (note! 2AFF not 2B00)
     -iDOS.HEX                (per the original instructions)
     -r3E00                   (per the original instructions)
     -s1D00                   (note! repatch the serial # back in)
        00 01
        00 02
        00 03     etc, etc, etc
     -^C                      (exit DDT)
5.  A>sysgen
    SOURCE DRIVE NAME (OR RETURN TO SKIP):       <ret>
    DESTINATION DRIVE NAME (RETURN TO REBOOT):   1



Hope this helps.  Russell Gaspari,  Los Angeles,  9/23/87.
