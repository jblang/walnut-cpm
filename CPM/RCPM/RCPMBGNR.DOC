
              WHAT THIS SYSTEM IS AND HOW TO USE IT

                          by Tim Evans
                           (07/14/84)

This is for beginning users of this and other similar systems. It 
assumes  virtually  no knowledge of computer  communications  and 
bulletin  boards,  and  only  a  little  knowledge  of  the  CP/M 
operating  system.  You  should  be reading this  before  you  do 
anything else with this system.


1) What is a Remote Bulletin Board System (RBBS)?

You  obviously have some idea of what an RBBS is:  you  connected 
with  this  one.  For  the record,  an RBBS (or BBS in  the  most 
generic  sense) is simply somebody else's computer (it  could  be 
anything  from  an  ATARI to an IBM PC) running  a  special  RBBS 
program.  You  can call an RBBS using your computer,  modem,  and 
telephone line.   As the term "bulletin board" implies,  you  can 
use an RBBS to "tack up" your messages for others to read and you 
can read messages left by others.

The  above  describes  ONE of the two  major  uses  for  personal 
computers   and  telecommunications,  or "networking",  as it  is 
popularly known.  But not all, so read on.

So,  why  would  you  want to do this?  Here  are  some  possible 
reasons:

     You  want  to  find others who have  computers  like  yours. 

     You're  having  a problem with your brand new  computer  and 
     your dealer knows less about it than you do.
 
     You want to sell your old printer (modem,  drive), and get a 
     fancy new one.

     You  want  some information about  a  terrific-sounding  new 
     piece  of  software.

     You  want a clue to help you solve a problem in  the  latest 
     Infocom (copyright) game.

     You want to find other people who share your enthusiasm  for 
     stamp collecting, or play writing, or East Asian cooking.

Well,  you can post messages about any one of these things--and a 
thousand and one others-- on an RBBS.

RBBS  systems  exist all over the United States,  as well  as  in 
other  countries.  Most of them are for people who are interested 
in  computers  and  computing;  others are for  people  who  have 
computers  and  who  also  have  special  interests,  like,  say, 
tracking  the  Space Shuttle in orbit or translating  Swahili  to 
Esperanto.  You are basically unlimited in the kinds of  messages 
you can post on an RBBS (although good taste,  Ma Bell, and Uncle 
Sam--you're  using Interstate Commerce,  remember?--dictate  that 
you should keep it clean and, of course, legal).

The  question  of keeping your messages "legal" is  an  important 
one:  Copying  copyrighted software (programs) for anything other 
than backup purposes is ILLEGAL; it's also illegal to use an RBBS 
to  advertise the fact that you want to break the copyright  law; 
and it's also illegal to post obscene messages on an RBBS.

     THIS BOARD DOES NOT ALLOW ANY SUCH MESSAGES!  ANY  THAT 
     ARE  POSTED WILL BE REMOVED.  ANY USE OF THIS BOARD FOR 
     SUCH  PURPOSES WILL LIKELY RESULT IN YOUR ACCESS TO USE 
     THIS  BOARD BEING REVOKED.   (SEE THE  SYSTEM  "POLICY" 
     FILE, FOR FURTHER DETAILS)

Okay,  so much for the basic behavior rules. Now, you have gotten 
on (that's "logged on",  in network-ese!),  and you see something 
staring back at you that looks similar to this:

     COMMAND (B, C, E, G, K, P, Q, R, S, T, W, X) ?

Let's take these commands one at a time, but not in precisely the 
order  shown  above.   First,  there are  several  "housekeeping" 
commands.

     "B"  means  "I  want to read any special  Bulletins  on  the 
     board."

     "P"  means  "I want to change my Password."  (Unfortunately, 
     some people think it's fun to screw up RBBS'.  Consequently, 
     this one,  and more and more others, are setting up Password 
     systems for security.)

     "T" means "I want to Talk to the sysop, so Toggle (ring) the 
     bell  on the RBBS computer and call him/her." (IF the  sysop 
     is  available,   you  can  Talk  with  him/her  keyboard  to 
     keyboard. This function is also accessible from CP/M, called 
     "CHAT")

     "X" means "I'm an eXpert at using the RBBS and I don't  need 
     all these messages taking up my time, so just go into eXpert 
     mode."

     "W"  means "Show me the Welcome message again."  (That's the 
     first thing you saw when you connected with the RBBS.)

     "G"  means  "Goodbye,  I want to disconnect from the  RBBS."  
     (You'll be asked if you want to leave a private message  for 
     the sysop; do so if you want.  THIS is the place to pour out 
     your problems, without being overseen by the general public, 
     if needed.)

The  next  batch  of  commands relates  to  reading  and  posting 
messages on the board.

     "E"  means "I want to Enter a message." (You'll be asked for 
     information  about  the addressee of your  message  and  its 
     subject.) Then you just type it in. Once you're done, you'll 
     be  presented  with  a short menu giving you the  chance  to 
     correct  errors  (Edit)  in your  message,  to  delete  your 
     message--in  case you change your mind--and/or to  save  and 
     post it on the board where the addressee will find it.  

     "R" means "I want to Read a message(s)."  You'll be asked to 
     specify the number of the message you want to read.

     "Q"  means "I want a Quick summary of the message(s) on  the 
     board.  Again, you'll be asked for a message number.

     "S"  means  "I want to Scan the message(s) on the  board;  I 
     want more information than "Q" gives me,  but not as much as 
     'R.'" As with "R" and "Q," you'll be asked for a number.

     "K"  means  "I want to Kill (erase) a message."   You'll  be 
     asked for a message number.   For obvious reasons,  you  can 
     only  kill  a  message you have  posted,  or  one  which  is 
     addressed to you.

If you want to "R",  "Q" or "S",  a particular message,  or do so 
continuously, or just to begin with a specific message do this:  
     
     Follow the "R," "Q," and "S" with a semi-colon (";"), then a 
     number.  For example,  "R;135" means "I want to read message 
     number 135.  For another example,  "S;135+" means "I want to 
     Scan all the messages on the board beginning with number 135 
     and go on up continuously.  (Substituting a minus ("-") sign 
     in  the last example causes the Scan to run backwards,  from 
     135 down.)


     Private messages 

Some  RBBS  systems  allow a special password  to  be  placed  on 
messages entered,  for privacy.  This is a "*" character, used as 
the  FIRST  character entered at the "Password ?"  prompt.   Just 
skip it with a RETURN, for a normal (public) message.  

NOTE!  THIS  password  has nothing at all to do with  any  system 
access password, it is just a privacy measure, for messages ONLY.  
In  general,  many  systems  do NOT  encourage  private  messages 
between users,  since it is contrary to the open forum idea.   If 
you need privacy, pick up the handset, and voice-it, if you will.  
Leave  any  necessary private info to the sysop as a  comment--no 
one else will see it.

Various other RBBS systems are in use for message  exchange,  and 
perform the same basic functions as are described above.  You may 
for  example,  dial  into  another system with  "RBBS"  (or  some 
variant)  in the name,  arranged in somewhat  different  fashion, 
with more or fewer commands.  The important thing is that the end 
goal  is  identical,  the storing and retrieval of  the  messages 
posted by the users.   Indeed, this is ALL that some RBBS systems 
do,  that  is  they  may have no provisions for any  other  basic 
functions.


2) RCPM's:  A Special Kind of RBBS System

On   the   other   hand,    the   second   major   thing    which 
telecommunications brings to the personal computer has a exciting 
flavor  all its on.   There is something very special about  this 
and other RCPM (Remote CP/M) boards. You can, of course, use them 
for  posting messages,  but the main emphasis is much  different, 
and  you will usually find the RBBS function a bit of a side show 
on many RCPM's.   Why?  Because there is simply much, much, more. 
(You  probably have some idea of what,  but for the moment  let's 
pretend you don't.) 

The  primary purpose of RCPM's is for sharing  computer  software 
and  information--that  is software and information that is  FREE 
and not restricted by copyright.  RCPM systems like this one have 
some  of this free "public domain" stuff "on line" and  available 
for you.  In order to get it though,  there needs to be some  way 
for you to tell the RCPM you want something it has,  and some way 
to handle the transfer.

     Giving Commands to Somebody Else's Computer.

That  in a nutshell is what a RCPM system is all  about.  Through 
the use of your computer,  modem,  communications  software,  and 
telephone,  you can gain control of another computer on the other 
side  of  town (or halfway across the country) and tell it to  do 
something--specifically,  to send you something.  (Of course, you 
can  also send something TO the RCPM-- and it is the  people  who 
SEND things who support this and other RCPM boards.)

          Commands versus menus

Since the RCPM is just what it says,  that is a remotely operated 
CP/M  computer,  it  logically follows that YOU make  it  do  its 
thing,  using (generally) the same standard CP/M commands you use 
on  your  own CP/M computer at home.   On an RCPM,  you have  the 
computers  commands  available to you to do  anything  you  want.  
Some  RBBS' (including some from which you can get free software) 
work with a series of "Menus."  On these systems,  you  generally 
select  the command you want from a list of possible commands  on 
the  screen,  and that may well lead you to  another  menu,  then 
another,  then  another.   While  these systems are a bit  easier 
(more "user friendly") to use for the novice,  it generally takes 
somewhat longer to accomplish a particular operation on  one--you 
have  to  go  through  a  series of menus  and  this  may  become 
important  if you're calling long-distance.   With an  RCPM,  you 
simply give the system direct commands--but of course you have to 
know the commands.  Take your choice. 

     RCPM Commands

Okay, let's get right down to it.  You're logged onto this system 
and you want to see about "downloading" (having the RCPM send you 
something).  From the RBBS system,  the first thing you do is  to 
select  the  "C" (for CP/M) option from the menu of  choices  you 
have.  (You  did  notice  there's been no discussion of  the  "C" 
option from the opening menu of command, didn't you?)

After a few seconds (where you may be played a few basic messages 
about what is to come) you'll see something like the following on 
your screen:

          A0>

This  is called the CP/M "prompt."  It means the RCPM computer is 
waiting  for YOU to tell it what to do.  What this means is  that 
you are (within certain limits) in control of the RCPM  computer.  
(At this point,  if you feel totally confused, it is fair to warn 
you  that  perhaps a brushup on the basic CP/M  commands  are  in 
order, THEN call back and pick it up here.) 

Now that you're getting used to this feeling of power, let's look 
at  what you can do with it.   Want to know what files  the  RCPM 
computer has on line?  Well, use the same command you use sitting 
at your own CP/M computer:

          DIR 
          (or DIR B:)

     At this point,  the main thing to understand is that it 
     matters not whether you are actually right AT the  RCPM 
     computer, or sitting at home.  Commands from either the 
     RCPM  keyboard or from yours (via the modem/phone) tell 
     the  RCPM  what to do.   It is as if you  were  at  the 
     remote console!

Want to change the "logged" drive?   Again,  use the same command 
you use with your own computer:

          B:
          (or C:, etc.)

Now, you're logged onto drive B: (or C:, whatever).

Want  to  see  the contents of a text file?  Just  use  the  TYPE 
command, as in:

          TYPE SYSTEM.DOC
          (This will "TYPE" the file "SYSTEM.DOC")

(Note: Most RCPM's--including this one--limit the length of files 
you can TYPE,  however,  so this isn't always the best way to get 
what you want.)

Want  to run a program you see on the RCPM directory?  Just enter 
in the name of the COM file, that is the program you want to run.  
In fact, that is just what you did above, when you entered "DIR", 
and the RCPM gave you a directory of the files on the disc.  Most 
RCPM's use a more spiffy "DIR.COM",  in lieu of the plain vanilla 
CP/M built in "DIR", and that is why you see the files all neatly 
sorted and sized for your display.

So,  now  it  is  apparent that you can  use  the  standard  CP/M 
commands  to  control  the  RCPM computer as if  it  were  really 
sitting in your own living room instead of on the other end of  a 
telephone line. That's exactly what's happening.

(There  are  some  standard CP/M commands that DON'T work  on  an 
RCPM:  Obviously,  no one should be able to ERAse or REName files 
on  a RCPM;  and--as we shall see--PIP seems irrelevant when  you 
have XMODEM to use.   Don't try "ERA" on an RCPM, it will log you 
off,  and  probably flag you as a "TWIT"--the arch-enemy  of  the 
sysop and all the other users!)

There's  one  more  thing you might not be  familiar  with.  Most 
RCPM's  operate  with "hard" disk drives,  drives that hold  vast 
amounts of material. In order to have an organized way of finding 
files on hard drive systems, the drives are divided up TWO ways-- 
this into the familar drives (A:,  B:, C: etc.) but also what are 
called  "USER" areas.   What this means is that the files on each 
of  the  drives are divided up into a number of  groups  of  file 
directories,  almost  as if each group was a separate drive.  (If 
this  wasn't  done,  the Directories would be so large  that  you 
couldn't find what you were looking for without a special  search 
program.   Remember, we are talking megabytes of storage--ever do 
a DIR on a 1 megabyte directory, and feel lost?)

     Moving about in drives and USER areas

At  any  given  moment,  your  current drive  and  USER  area  is 
indicated by the RCPM's prompt,  such as "A0>",  above.   You can 
log onto the separate USER areas of a hard disk drive,  by simply 
typing "USER" (don't type the quotation marks),  followed by  the 
number  for  the USER area you want.  For instance,  suppose  you 
wanted to change from drive A,  USER 0 to drive A,  USER 1.  Just 
give the following command (from the A0> prompt):

          USER 1

On  this type of system you have basically TWO ways that the file 
directories  are  arranged.   One is "horizontally",  or  by  the 
familiar drives,  A:.  B:, etc.  The other is "vertically", or by 
USER  areas.   As  just one example,  6 drives and 9  USER  areas 
allows   54  possible  different  directories.    Each  can  hold 
specialized file types,  for varied interests.   Think of it as a 
big electronic program library--that's what it is!

You  can  also  COMBINE  the commands  for  (1)  logging  onto  a 
different  disk drive and (2) changing the USER  area,  into  one 
SINGLE command.  Say,  you're logged onto drive A,  USER 0  (your 
CP/M prompt is A0>) and you want to log onto drive F:, USER 7. If 
the system is running the "ZCPR2" style of drive/user  selection, 
give the following command:

          F7:

and you will then see a new prompt, "F7>".
    
Or,  if  the system uses the "NZCPR" style of drive/user  switch, 
you would enter the equivalent command as:

          F: 7
          (note the space)

and  again see the "F7>".   Try both types on your RCPM,  and see 
which is being used.  Either way, it will save time!


GETTING YOUR FREE SOFTWARE

Now that we've gone through all these preliminary technicalities, 
how do you go about getting to all this free software on a  RCPM? 
Actually,  it's  very simple.  Virtually all RCPM's use a special 
program made for transferring files from one computer to  another 
by way of a telephone and a modem.  It's called "XMODEM" and it's 
very simple to use.

Let's  say you've gotten onto a RCPM and you've mastered all  the 
information you've read in this document so far.  By now,  you've 
read  the directories of the several drives and found a file  you 
want to have sent to you.  Suppose, for the time being, this file 
(which  is  the  best computer game since  ADVENTURE)  is  called 
BESTGAME.OBJ.  See  below for an explanation of the "OBJ" part of 
the filename.)

Here's the simple, three-part command that tells the RCPM to send 
BESTGAME.COM to your computer (by the way,  you'll generally want 
to  be  logged  onto  the drive on which  the  program  you  want 
resides):

          XMODEM S BESTGAME.OBJ

The first part of the command is,  of course,  XMODEM (XMODEM  is 
the name of a CP/M COM,  or COMmand,  file).   The "S" stands for 
(you  guessed it) "Send."  The third part is the name of the file 
you want sent.

That was easy. At this point a message will appear on your screen 
telling  you it will take a specified amount of time to send  the 
file.  Also, it will tell you to begin receiving the file.

Obviously,  the  next  thing you need to know is how  to  receive 
BESTGAME.OBJ.  You have to tell YOUR computer you want to RECEIVE 
the  file.   Your computer and modem package will tell  the  RCPM 
when  it  is  ready  to receive  it,  via  special  "handshaking" 
signals.  As far as what you do to tell your particular  program, 
there  are  a  number  of ways to  do  this,  depending  on  what 
communications  software you're using-- the specific details  you 
have  to  figure this part out on your own,  from your  program's 
instructions.

However,  all  is  not lost.  If you're using MODEM7 or  a  later 
variant (which are all public domain--that  is,  FREE--programs), 
your  command (issued on the MODEM7 "Command Line"--to Receive  a 
file from an RCPM is very similar to the XMODEM command above:

          RT BESTGAME.OBJ

"R" stands for (what else?) "Receive." "T" tells MODEM7 to return 
to the "Terminal Mode" when the transfer is finished.   After you 
enter  this command,  and hit the RETURN key,  XMODEM takes over, 
and it's all automatic.  

That's  it.   You've  just "downloaded" your first piece of  FREE
software,  and the file will appear on your disc.   "BESTGAME" is 
ready to run, after you REName it to a COM type (below).

You can get a bit sophisticated--and save yourself a few  seconds 
of  telepone time--if you know beforehand the drive and USER ares 
where  the  file you want is  located.   Assume  BESTGAME.OBJ  is 
located on Drive F,  USER 0.   Instead of first logging onto that 
drive/USER area, simply type:

          XMODEM S F0:BESTGAME.OBJ

                             * * * *

At  this point it should be quite obvious that the standard  file 
transfer program used on RCPM's is XMODEM.   Therefore,  you MUST 
have  a  program  on  your  end which  is  compatible  with  this 
protocol.  If you are not sure, ask about this where you got your 
program,  or read your documentation.  Be well advised that while 
there  are  many  commercial  programs  which  do  support   this 
protocol, there are simply a bounty of public domain (FREE!) ones 
which  do  also,  since the first CP/M modem program  using  this 
protocol was originally devised by Ward Christensen and placed in 
the public domain.  If all you have is a simple terminal program, 
but  you  CAN save ASCII text,  ask the sysop  about  "MBOOT",  a 
program  which can be used to get an XMODEM compatible program up 
on your computer.

                             * * * * 

RETURNING THE FAVOR--UPLOADING

Obviously, the files on a RCPM don't just appear out of thin air; 
they  come  from somewhere.  That somewhere is the users  of  the 
system--which now includes you. Just as you can take from a RCPM, 
you  can  give  back by sending  files  TO  it.   Perhaps  you're 
learning  to program in BASIC;  or you're writing dBASE II files; 
or you've figured out all the puzzles in Planetfall (a  copyright 
game by INFOCOM).  Well,  then, you can send your program or text 
file (by the way,  this piece was contributed by an RCPM user) to 
the  RCPM.  Here  are  the commands to send MYFILE.BAS  (a  BASIC 
program you've written) to a RCPM:

          XMODEM R MYFILE.BAS

Simple,  right? Again, XMODEM is the command to invoke the XMODEM 
program; "R" stands for "Receive."

Again,  what  you do on your end depends on what software  you're 
using, but if you're using MODEM7, it's simple:

          ST MYFILE.BAS

Of course, this command is issued on the MODEM7 Command Line. "S" 
is for "Send;" "T" tells MODEM7 to return to Terminal Mode.

That's it.   You've just contributed to your local RCPM.   Before 
you know it,  your program will be on every RCPM in the  country; 
other  people  will be finding ways to improve it and  sooner  or 
later  it'll turn back up on your local RCPM in its new clothes--
but with your name still on it.

That,  perhaps,  is  one  of  the most  satisfying  things  about 
contributing to an RCPM.  YOUR program may very well work its way 
all  the way across the country and back,  finding its way  (with 
your name on it) into the software libraries of who know how many 
people out there.

 
SOME LAST TECHINICALITIES


Believe it or not, the 10, 20 and 30 megabyte hard disks on which 
RCPM's  run  sooner  or later get crowded with  all  these  great 
programs  you  have uploaded.  In order to pack as many files  as 
possible  onto  them,  our hacker friends  have  devised  special 
programs to conserve disk space. Many of the files on a RCPM have 
been run through these space-saving programs and you have to know 
a little about them in order to make the best use of the RCPM.

     Squeezed files

The  first  thing  you should know about  are  "SQUEEZED"  files. 
Without going into the technicalities,  a "squeezed" version of a 
file  just  takes up less space than an "unsqueezed" one--and  it 
takes  less time to transfer by modem,  saving you time  and  (if 
you're  calling  long-distance,   money.  As  you've  undoubtedly 
noticed  in looking at the directories of this RCPM,  many of the 
files  have funny-looking suffixes like "DQC" or "BQS" or  "HQP." 
Any file with a "Q" in the second position of its  three-position 
filename suffix has been squeezed, and you must "UNSQUEEZE" it in 
order  to use it.  Fortunately,  there is a program on all RCPM's 
for "unsqueezing" files;  it's called USQ.OBJ (the file name  may 
have  a  number  in it--USQ15.OBJ,  for example).  USQ  (and  its 
companion, SQ) should be one of the first few files you download; 
it'll save you time and money.

     Libraries

LIBRARIES are another space saver.  Frequently, related files are 
grouped together into a single "Library" file,  identified by  an 
"LBR" extension, such as: "GAMES.LBR".  The Library takes up less 
space (and takes less time to transfer) than the individual files 
do, even though they may already have been squeezed. For example, 
most  RCPM's have a bunch of miscellaneous WordStar (tm)  related 
files  grouped  into  a library.   RCPM's provide you  a  way  of 
looking into a library to see what's in it.

     You  can  use the LDIR command (at the CP/M prompt)  to  see 
     what's in a particular library; or

     You  can use the LTYPE command to type a text file out of  a 
     library.

You can save time by downloading an entire library instead of the 
individual files one by one, but you can also download individual 
files from a library if you want (say, if you don't know what the 
library is all about and you want to download just the "DOC" file 
to see).

Once you've downloaded a library of files,  you'll need a program 
to  "extract"  the  files from it.  You do this  with  a  LIBRARY 
UTILITY  program.  These  are generally called LU.OBJ  (sometimes 
with  an  indentifying  version number  in  the  file  name--say, 
LU300.OBJ). This should be another of your early downloads.

Finally,  there's  the  "OBJ"  file thing.   In  order  to  avoid 
activating  undesirable  CP/M  command files stored  in  an  RCPM, 
system   operators  ("sysops")  generally  change  the   filename 
extension  of a "COM" file to "OBJ."  For example,  remember  our 
BESTGAME.OBJ  file?  Well,  it's really a CP/M command file which 
you'll  have to REName BESTGAME.COM,  once you've downloaded  it.  
Or,  it is most simple to just use the "COM" extension with  your 
modem program's command for a filename (ie, "RT BESTGAME.COM").

     Some "homework"

OK,  that's the introductory piece on RBBS' and RCPM's.   There's 
lots more information here.  The place to start is by downloading 
some  of  the other "DOC" (or "DQC") files so you can learn  more 
about this system.  Start with these, on A0: (some may also be on 
B0:,  don't  overlook  that area).   What each will tell  you  is 
obvious, from the names.

     COMMANDS.DOC
     SYSTEM.DOC
     XMODEM.DOC
     SYSTEM.MAP

You  can  also download a master directory of all  the  available 
files on this system, from drive B0:, the file DISKMENU.DQC.

When you have all of that,  and are still curious,  feel free  to 
use the system's built in HELP facilty.   Just enter "HELP BHEC", 
and  follow  the menu selections which display,  to get  help  on 
system topics.   Also,  see the other files in the HELP directory 
(C4:), which have the HLP (or HQP) extension.  For help on any of 
these,  enter  "HELP  TOPIC",  where TOPIC is the first  part  of 
"TOPIC.HLP" (or TOPIC.HQP).

Of course,  you can always ask questions,  either directed to the 
sysop,  or  to "ALL",  and call on your fellow users.   You'll be 
surprised at how helpful this can be.
