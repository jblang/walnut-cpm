			   	   Why NUCHAT?

            Have you ever called  a  system  and  then paged the SYSOP
          only to find he does not answer?  If you wanted  to  leave a
          message then you probably entered the BBS  for  that system,
          and then left your message. 

            That is why I wrote NUCHAT. Different  name so it will not
          be confused with the 'standard' CHAT. This upgrade  was made
          in hopes of getting it somewhat compatible with CHAT.

            There are basically two choices; First you can use  NUCHAT
          in direct replacement of  the current CHAT program (although
          NUCHAT  has no provisions for anything less that CP/M  2.x).
          Second, if  you  find it cannot replace CHAT, then maybe you
          could then use COMSEC.  COMSEC  (computer  secretary) is the
          message system without CHAT.  Maybe  it would be possible to
          chain COMSEC in the event there is no answer in CHAT? Ethier
          way, a message may be left without having to re-enter a  BBS
          (or if there is no BBS online!). 

            The commands  are  very  similar  between  both programs. 
          NUCHAT does  allow  the  callers  name to be sent to the CRT
          upon entering  (if  you  are using RBBS only), hence sending
          the callers name is only accomplished if an RBBS is present. 

            If there is  no  answer  from the SYSOP then the caller is
          automatically entered  into  the  message mode.  A different
          prompt will be presented in this mode too, with instructions
          on saving the message or  aborting.   Once  the  message  is
          saved the  program  will  store  it  to  disk ALONG with the
          callers  name at the end of the message.  A delimmiter  will
          be inserted to allow easy selection  between messages in the
          file when typed out. 

            There  are  several options the user can change.  A couple
          of the important ones allow the  size of the message file to
          be set.  This way a wave of callers cannot fill the disk  up
          (see  note in source).  The number of similar characters can
          be checked also.  The maximum can only be 8  less  than  the
          number  of  characters  per  line.   This  is  due from  the
          automatic CRLF insert. 

            All in all it might possibly  make  life  easier  for  the
          caller  and  you.  Although it does give the  sysop  another
          file to check (sigh)....

			  	  What happens?


When the user types in the program name, the following occurs:

                  1) The  LASTCALR file (if RBBS=YES) is checked for exist-
                     ence, and aborts if it does not exist.
                  2) The file is opened,  or created if  necessary  and the
                     current contents  (if any)  is  DMA'd right  after the
                     program in memory. MEMLIM is used to control the size.
                  3) After  pointers are  established,  the sign-on for the
                     particular option is presented. Note also that this is
                     the  time  the  LASTCALR  name is typed CRT device (if
                     SEEIT=YES). Remeber: If one can bypass the normal sign
                     on,  the  LASTCALR  name may  contain a previous user!

                                * * *     FEATURES     * * *

                  This program is basically CHAT but with several advantages
                  that help the SYSOP.

                  Whenever a conversation  has taken place,  the contents of
                  the buffer  can be saved.  This  includes normal CHAT mode
                  and the  MESSAGE mode.  If the  SYSOP  does not answer the
                  PAGE mode, the caller is then dumped into the MESSAGE mode
                  automatically.  The sysop can even  save any 'chat' he had
                  with a caller.

                  Just  about  every error  that might occur,  is tested and
                  displayed

              *    Full error trapping exists on  all disk  I/O  activities.

              *   One can also limit the amount of memory  used by this pro-
                  gram, hence also the size of the message file.

              *   User area  equates are used for both message and  LASTCALR
                  files.

              *   Another feature is to try and trap as many  'twits' as you
                  can.  This is attempted  by keeping track of the number of
                  repetitive characters.  If the value  equals the  'TOMANY'
                  equate,  it aborts saving nothing the user types in except
                  his name  (and a message  telling you why he  doesn't have
                  a message for you).
                    The only catch is,  the maximum value can only be 8 less
                  than the  number  of  characters-per-line  limit.  This is
                  because  the  program  inserts  CRLF  pairs automatically,
                  and the 'counter' will be reset.

            I'll leave it up  the  operator  if they want the users to
          know about  the  'D'  option  for  immediately  entering the
          MESSAGE mode. 

            I am  aware  of  no 'bugs'. I have tested (I hope) for all
          types of conditions....but we all know how that goes..... 

            Please, if any modifications (or bugs), I would appreciate
          knowing the whereabouts of them by leaving a message on:
