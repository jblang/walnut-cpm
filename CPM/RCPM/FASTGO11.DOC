Distribution
------------
This program is released to the public domain and may
be distributed freely, provided that no monetary gain
is incurred.

Description
-----------
FASTGO 1.0 is designed to be used on a hard or floppy
system to provide an easier way to change from one
drive/user area to another. Any drive/user area may
be assigned a label and optional password. Typing
GOTO lists usage and displays the userareas defined.

Usage
-----
GOTO          Displays usage and userareas available.

GOTO userarea Moves the user into the specified
              area. If the userarea is invalid,
              displays valid areas. A password may
              be required.

Configuration
-------------
The user may specify the number of columns for the info.
display to print across, the character to use for a
divider, and whether or not to chain to a .COM file
upon entering the new area. See the source file for
details on what to do.

Comments
--------
This version incorporates the chain concept and moving
the code up to high memory, so that the chain file
may be loaded and ran from 100h. Features that I plan
to add in the future are...

* Selectable masking of passworded user-areas from
  the info. display.

* Auto logoff of a user who tries repeatedly to
  gain access to a passworded area.

* Logging same users name to a special file.


Any comments, suggestions, revisions, etc. should
be left on OBBS 402-346-4206.
