                          INTRODUCTION



     When logging onto my first RCP/M system (Seneca, when it was
still  in  El  Paso),  I was confronted with a  system  that  was
totally alien to me.  My only contact with bulletin board systems
until  then  had been with Compuserve and some local  BBS's  that
were menu driven.

     Since I was totally lost, I decided that it would be best to
find  some  documentation  on  the operation  of  RCP/M's  before
logging   on   again.   If  you  have  attempted  to  find   such
documentation,  you  are  well  aware  that  it  is  not  readily
available (I never did find any).

     Over the next year or so,  I became familiar with the proper
operation  of RCP/M's,  and am now running my own.  I  have  been
watching  new users as they attempt to use my system,  and it  is
evident  that many users do not know how to properly operate  the
system.  Even those that can eventually get what they need  could
operate in a more effective manner.

     It  is with these thoughts in mind that I have written  this
users guide.  There are many different BBS packages in use on the
various RCP/M's, but many of them have the same command structure
for  the  basic  functions,  and  almost  all  of  the  utilities
available for use in CP/M are operated in the same manner. I have
attempted to cover as much as I can without being too specific in
regards  to the implementation of the particular system you  will
be using.

     I  hope that this users guide will make the transition  into
the  world  of RCP/M's much less frustrating for you than it  was
for me.  Please feel free to pass this document on to anyone  who
is  new to telecommunications,  and let others have the chance to
learn how to operate with a minimum of effort and frustration.

1.00  NULLS

     On the majority of the RCP/M's that you will find, the first
thing  that  you will be confronted with is the number  of  nulls
prompt.  The  usual  reply will be 0,  but some  terminals,  when
operating at 1200 baud,  will have a tendency to drop  characters
from  the leftmost portion of the screen.  This is caused by  the
terminal's  inability to move the cursor fast enough to the  left
of  the screen after receiving a carriage return.  As the  remote
terminal  is  still  moving the cursor,  the host  system  begins
transmitting the characters that make up the next line.

     This  lack  of speed will result in one or  more  characters
being lost.  To eliminate this problem, nulls can be sent after a
carriage  return,  allowing the cursor to return to the far left.
The  best  way  to determine the correct number of  nulls  is  to
increase  it  by  one until the problem  of  lost  characters  is
eliminated.


1.01  The Log-on

     After correctly setting the number of nulls,  the next  step
is to log onto the system with your name. Some systems expect the
first and last names to both be entered on one line,  and  others
will prompt for them seperatly.  Pay close attention to this,  as
you  must log onto the system with the EXACT same name each time,
or the system will think you are a new user.

     Most  systems will prompt you for the city and state if  you
are logging on for the first time, so if you get this prompt, and
you have been on the system before,  then you did not log in with
the  same name as you did previously.  Abort the call,  and  call
back using the correct name.

     If the system has determined that you are logging on for the
first time, you will be asked to enter a password. Be sure to pay
attention to the minimum or maximum number of characters allowed,
and  since some systems are case sensitive,  be sure to make note
of the case you used (upper or lower).

     You will more than likely next receive a new users file that
will  give  some of the do's and don'ts of the  system,  and  the
steps that are necessary to become a validated member.  READ THIS
FILE, as you won't see it on your next log-on.

     Most RCP/M's use a tiered system of access.  A new user will
probably  only be able to read the messages,  and leave a parting
comment  to  the sysop.  Validated users will be  able  to  leave
messages,  and if it is requested,  have access to CP/M. You must
leave  the  required information before the sysop  will  validate
you, so be sure to see what the sysop requires.

                           RCP/M GUIDE                        


     Most sysops will NOT leave you a message letting you know if
the access level you requested has been granted,  so the only way
to  ascertain if it has been is to attempt the function that  you
requested.  If the function is still not available,  then  access
has not yet been granted. Try again in 24 hours, and if still not
validated, leave another message to the sysop.

     I  have  included a sample log-on session below for  a  MBBS
system. Most are similar in nature.

     This  RCPM system is set up mainly to support the CP/M user,
and to operate it effectively,  a knowledge of CP/M is  required.
If you are not familiar with CP/M, it is recommended that you not
request access to CP/M. If you haven't used it before, you would
be completely lost.

     If  you are interested in having access to the CP/M  portion
of  this  board,  leave a parting comment to the Sysop with  your
name, address, phone number, type of computer, and type of termi-
nal program you are using.

     If you are only interested in access to the BBS,  just leave
your name and phone number. The BBS portion of this board is very
easy to use, and no knowledge of CP/M is required.

1.02 The Main Menu

     After a successful log-on, you will usually see a summary of
the  message  file,  and then the main menu.  The  main  menu  is
usually a series of letters for the various functions, and almost
all will give a detailed list if the '?' is typed at the prompt.
     If  you are not familiar with the functions of a  particular
BBS,  be  sure to save the menu in the ASCII save buffer of  your
terminal  program  for print out  and  referral.  Another  useful
function  that is usually available is H for HELP,  and it should
also be saved to your buffer for later referral.

     The  following listings will show the menu functions of some
of the more popular RBBS packages.

=================================================================


MBBS Function (A,B,C,E,G,H,K,M,N,P,Q,R,S,T,U,W,X or ? for menu)? ?


(ctrl-S or S pauses/ctrl-C or C aborts/ctrl-X or X skips)


 MBBS Functions:

 A = Auto wrap toggle  K = Kill message      S = Scan messages
 B = show Bulletins    M = '[More]' toggle   T = Talk with sysop
 C = exit to CP/M      N = set # of Nulls    U = Upper/lower case
 E = Enter message     P = change Password   W = Welcome message
 G = Goodbye (hangup)  Q = Quick summary     X = eXpert mode toggle
 H = show Help file    R = Read message      ? = print this menu

 ; = separator used to enter multiple commands & data on one line
 NEW, MAIL, TAGGED, 'search' = words useable as message 'numbers'

 (Use HELP, WELCOME message and BULLETINS for more information.)

 (NOTE: password required for CP/M access, but a clue is given.)

RBBS4102b


Major Functions supported (Capital letters on command line):

        C = Exit to CP/M        E = Enter message
        F = List subject files  G = Goodbye (disconnect)
        K = Kill message        R = Read message
        S = Quick summary       N = Read New messages

Minor Functions supported (Small letters on command line):

        b = Retype bulletins    m = Show status of messages
        p = Change password     t = Toggle bell prompt
        u = List user file      w = Retype welcome
        x = eXpert user mode

Two subcommands are supported in support of major commands K,R & S:

        + = Lists following a message number operates on all messages
            the user is authorized pausing appropriately between them

        * = Performs the same operation without pausing (for use with
            hardcopy devices

Commands may be strung together, separated by semicolons. For
example 'R;123' retrieves message number 123.  For forward
sequential retrieval, use '+' or '*' after message number.  N is
equivalent to R;#+.

Software exchange is done under CP/M using the XMODEM program
(for intelligent transfer) or the TYPE fn.ft command (simple
ASCII listing).


Functions supported:     by RBBS vers. 3.7

<B> Bulletin File               <C> Chat with SYSOP

    R;NEW         Read new msgs since your last logon (pause).

=================================================================


     A few of the commands available require further explanation,
and  different  letters  may be used for  the  same  commands  on
different boards,  so be sure to list the menu for the system you
will be using.

     EXPERT USER TOGGLE:  This is used to toggle the command line
prompts to much shorter prompts,  such as "Command:".  If you are
familiar with the system, this will save you time.

     TOGGLE  BELL:   Many  systems  will ring the  bell  on  your
terminal  every  time they expect user input.  If you  find  this
annoying, just toggle the bell off with this function.

     ENTER MESSAGE:   This function will vary greatly from system
to system, and it will be necessary to read the help file for the
one  that you are using.  Some will support Word Star  like  line
editing  (RBBS  4102),  while  others will require  retyping  the
entire line to be edited.

     The  rest of the functions are pretty much self-explanatory,
so no further detail is necessary.  The rest of this users  guide
will  be  devoted to operation while in CP/M (usually entered  by
typing 'C' from the function prompt).

2.00  A FEW FUNDAMENTALS


     The real power of a RCP/M is in it's database.  Many systems
are running hard disks,  some up to 150MB.  That is a huge amount
of software, and it is usually separated into different drive and
user areas.  For those not familiar with user areas, they are the
number  you  will see after the drive letter,  such as  'A2>'  or
'D5>'.

     If  you  are use to the standard Console  Command  Processor
(CCP) that CP/M uses, you have been receiving only a drive letter
as the command prompt. If you ever changed user areas, you had to
use the USER command. Even while in a user area other than 0, you
still  only  received  a drive letter for  the  prompt,  with  no
indication a what user area you were in.

     Most RCP/M's have replaced the standard CCP with one of  the
popular replacements,  ZCPR, ZCPR2, ZCPR3, NZCPR, or EZCPR. These
packages  will  allow you to change drives and user areas at  the
same time,  and will show the both the drive and user area in the
prompt.

     Another difference between the standard CCP and one of  it's
replacements is in the way commands are handled.  The sysop  will
define what is called a search path for the user. This means that
the  user can be logged onto any drive and user area,  and if the
command he desires lies in any of the drive/user area defined  in
the  search  path,  the  command will be  executed,  without  the
operator  having to prefix the command with the drive/user  area,
or be logged into the drive/user area where the command resides.

     Most  sysops will define the search path as "Current  Drive,
Current User",  then "Drive A,  User 0". All of the commands that
are  available  to the user are then placed on  drive  "A0:"  The
easiest  way to find out what commands are available to you is to
do  a directory of drive "A0:",  and any file with the  extension
".COM" is an available command.


Listed below is a directory of a typical RCP/M's drive "A0:"

A0>DIR

Time on system is 10 minutes


 Drive A0:  files: 16  space used: 184k  (2056k free)  
-ROOT   .     0k | LDIR    .COM  8k | TYPE    .COM  8k
05/11/85.DQR 32k | LUX     .COM  8k | WHATSFOR.COM  8k
BYE     .COM  8k | MAP     .COM  8k | WHATSNEW.COM  8k
CHAT    .COM  8k | MBBS    .COM 48k | XMODEM  .COM  8k
DIR     .COM  8k | RDIR    .COM  8k |
FILE    .COM  8k | SECTION .COM  8k |

                           RCP/M GUIDE                        


     If you were logged onto this system,  the only commands that
would   be available  to you are  those with the  .COM extension.
Several  of the commands (DIR and TYPE) appear to be the same  as
the  standard CCP's resident commands,  but in reality,  they are
enhanced  versions of the commands,  with the  resident  versions
disabled.

     You  will  also  notice that two of the files are  not  .COM
files,  '-ROOT'  and '05/01/85.DQR'.  You will usually  find  the
first file in a directory has a '-' in front of it,  and occupies
0k  of disk space.  This is the name of the particular  directory
that you are logged onto.

     In this case,  you are logged onto the 'ROOT' of the system,
where  all  the  commands reside.  The other file is  a  squeezed
master directory,  made on the date listed. I will explain what a
squeezed file is later in this guide.


2.01  MOVING AROUND


     One of the first things you must learn how to do,  once  you
have entered CP/M,  is to find out where you want to go,  and how
to  get there.  The two commands that facilitate this are SECTION
and MAP.  There are others used on some systems (ones using ZCPR3
in particular), and they will be covered also.

SECTION:  This  command  has two functions,  one is to  list  the
available  sections,  and  the  other is to move to  the  section
desired.  If the command SECTION is typed by itself, you will get
the following display.

A0>SECTION

Available sections are:
ROOT     UTIL     ZCPR     DBASE
TELECOM  LANG     PC-MSDOS WS
KAYPRO   MISC     SYSLIB   TANDY
NEWIN    MODEM    TRSDOS   TEXT
HELP    

Type "SECTION ?" for detailed list
      of available sections.

Type "SECTION <section-name>" to log
      into a particular section.

     As  you can see,  a listing of all the  sections  (directory
names)  is supplied,  and if a more detailed explanation of  what
each section contains is desired,  you can type 'SECTION ?'.  All
that  has  to  be  done  to log onto the  section  that  you  are
interested in is to type the command 'SECTION <section-name>.

                           RCP/M GUIDE                        


A0>SECTION MISC

C2>

     You are now logged onto drive 'C2:',  and are in the section
dedicated  to miscellaneous files.  The same basic  procedure  is
followed  with the command PWD.  After typing the PWD command,  a
listing of available sections is shown. To log onto that section,
all that is necessary is to type the sections name at the command
prompt, followed by a semicolon.


A0>MISC:
C2>

     The  command GO functions in much the same way  as  SECTION.
Another way to move around is with the command MAP.


A0>MAP

MAP v1.02, 03-01-1985

A0:  = ROOT    | A1:  = UTIL    | A2:  = ZCPR    | A3:  = DBASE

     You  now  have the option of using SECTION to log  into  the
directory  that  you want (if SECTION is available),  or  logging
onto the drive/user with its actual drive designation. If you are
using the system for the first time,  it would be wise to capture
the information supplied from these utilities in your text buffer
for later referral.


2.02  FINDING OUT WHAT'S THERE

     There  are very few systems that do NOT use Super  Directory
(SD)  as the directory command,  so that is the program that will
be covered in detail.  The command DIR by itself will invoke  the
following display.

Time on system is 22 minutes


  Drive A4:  files: 19  space used: 952k  (1824k free)

     More  information  is  supplied  with SD  than  is  normally
obtained  with the standard CCP's resident command.  The size  of
the file is listed,  and the listing is alphabetized. The size of
the  file  as shown by DIR may not necessarily be the  same  size
that will be occupied once it is on your disk.  This is dependent
on  the size of the allocation blocks of the drives that the file
is on.

     SD  has  many options available,  and I will cover the  more
useful ones.  All options must be supplied after a '$' at the end
of  the  command .  I will give several examples to  give  you  a
general idea.

     A - Show all user areas
     D - Show all drives
     L - Give a directory of a Library file
     N - No paging (no MORE prompt)
     4 - Give a 40 column display
     6 - 64 column
     8 - 80 column (usually the default)


DIR $AD     - Will show a directory of all drive and user areas.
DIR $ADLN   - Will show a directory of all drive and user  areas,
              including directories of all library files, and
              will give a continuous display without the 'MORE'
              prompt.

DIR RBBS.LBR $L  - Will show a library directory of the file
                    RBBS.LBR (assuming you are logged onto the
                    drive/user where the file resides).
DIR RBBS.LBR $AD - Will search all drive/user areas, and show
                    where the file RBBS.LBR is located.
DIR RBBS*.* $AD  - Will search all drive/user areas for any file
                    which contains RBBS as the first 4 letters,
                    and show where they are located.

     If at any time you wish to abort the directory program, type
^C, and it will terminate. There are many more options available,
but they are usually accessible only to the sysop,  so they won't
be covered.

     Another directory program that is available is RDIR,  and it
is  used to ascertain the time necessary to download a  file.  It
will usually co-exist with DIR,  and will automatically determine
the baud rate that you are logged on at.

A4>RDIR

MAP     .AQM  16k   5:55   | MBBS29  .LBR 136k  81:32

A4>>  Files: 19  Used: 952k  Free: 1824k  Time: 8:59:40 at 300 baud


     In the example shown above,  the file 'GO.ASM' would take 10
minutes and 4 seconds to download at 300 baud.

     There  is  one  more commonly used  directory  program,  but
before it is covered,  a short explanation of library files is in
order.  As far as CP/M is concerned, a library file is handled as
one file on the disk,  but it will actually contain many separate
files, and include its own directory. The individual files can be
extracted from the library, and then used in the manner that they
were originally intended.

     The  reason for libraries is beyond the scope of this  users
guide, but the utilities and documentation for them are available
on most all RCP/M's, and many of the system commands will support
them. The one that will be covered now is LDIR, and it is nothing
more  than  a program that will show the directory of  a  library
file (like DIR $L did).


A1>LDIR VF150       (note that the extension .LBR is not needed)

LBR directory for VF150   .LBR: (size in k)

VF150   .DQC  4k   |  VF150   .COM 12k

     This  is a small library file,  and in actual practice  they
can contain 100 entries or more.  Usually all the files necessary
for  a  particular  application  will  be  contained  within  one
library.  Without  libraries,  RCP/M's would not be able to  hold
near  the amount of software that they do now.  It also makes  it
easier to obtain all the files necessary for one application,  as
you  will  only need to perform one file  transfer,  rather  then
several.

2.03  WHAT'S IT DO ?

     Now that you know where the files are, and how to get there,
you need to be able to find out just what the file does . Many of
the file names for CP/M programs are cryptic,  to say the  least,
and  unless you are familiar with it,  you have no idea what  its
function is. This is where the TYPE command comes in.

     TYPE is usually the program TYPEL,  and it, like SD, is much
more  versatile  than the standard  CCP  resident  command.  Only
certain  files can be TYPE'd,  so now is a good a time as any  to
cover the standard file extensions,  and what they mean.  All  of
those listed directly below can be TYPE'd.


     BAS - Basic language source code.
     TXT - A standard format text file.
     CCC - 'C' source code.
     DOC - A documentation text file.
     WS  - A Word Star formatted text file.
     PAS - Pascal source code.
     ASM - Assembly source code.
     MAC - Assembly source code for MAC.
     DIR - A directory listing.
     HLP - Help file.


     If the second letter of the extension is 'Q',  then the file
is  a  SQUEEZED file,  and it must be  handled  differently.  For
example,  if a file has the extension .BQS,  it is squeezed basic
source code,  and .WQ means it is a squeezed Word Star  formatted
text file.

     Squeezing is a method used to compress a file,  and after  a
file has been squeezed,  it will take up less disk space.  A file
that  has  been compressed in this manner is not usable until  it
has been UNSQUEEZED,  but TYPE will allow you to view it,  as  it
knows  that  the  file  has  been squeezed  by  the  'Q'  in  the
extension, and will handle it accordingly.

     There  are  many files that cannot be TYPE'd,  and the  more
common ones are listed below.  If a file type you are  interested
in is not contained in either of these extension lists,  go ahead
and  try  it,  as the most damage that can be done is usually  to
mess up your display by sending video control codes.

UN-TYPEable file extensions.

     COM - Command files.
     LBR - Library files (individual members CAN be TYPE'd).
     REL - Relocatable object code.
     OBJ - Object code (usually a COM file).
     OVL - Overlays.




Once in CP/M                                              Page  13





                           RCP/M GUIDE                        


     To  TYPE a file,  just enter the command TYPE  filename.ext,
for example;

A0>TYPE DEMO.TXT

TYPEL v3.3 (c) ESKAY 07-07-84
(DEMO.TXT)

This is a short demo of a text file as typed by this program.

A0>


     To TYPE a file from within a library, enter the command TYPE
LBR-FN  MEMBER-FN.EXT.  For  example,  if  the library  is  named
RBBS.LBR, and the file in the LBR was RBBS.DQC, enter the command
'TYPE  RBBS  RBBS.DQC'.  Notice  that the LBR extension  was  not
necessary, as TYPEL assumes that if two filenames are supplied as
arguments, then the first filename is a LBR.

     The  sysop  has the option of limiting the number  of  lines
that  TYPEL will display before aborting,  and this is  sometimes
done  to  avoid having the system tied up by someone  TYPE'ing  a
very long text file.  By reading the first few lines,  a user can
usually  determine if he wants the file,  and if he  does,  other
methods are available to obtain it.

     One other type of file is usually found on RCP/M's and  they
are  there for the express purpose of being TYPE'd.  They usually
have  a  filename like -READ.ME or README.NOW.  These  files  are
short text files that contain information that is important,  and
should be read by the user.

     If the command TYPE is entered with no parameters,  you will
receive a short help file that is built into the program. It will
show the various options that are available.

        TYPEL BAR.ZOT $L            $L option=LST: device
If 1 argument is supplied, single file is typed.
If 2 arguments, TYPEL assumes first arg is type LBR
and attempts to type LBR member.

                           RCP/M GUIDE                        




     To reiterate,  the method used to find out what a file  does
is  to  locate either within the LBR directory,  or on  the  same
drive/user area, a DOC or text file, or the source code, and TYPE
the file. You should be able to ascertain the purpose of the file
within the first few lines of the selected text file.

     There is another utility that makes finding out what a  file
is for much easier, but it is fairly new, and is not yet popular.
It  is one of the best programs available for RCP/M usage to come
out  recently,  and  I hope that it gains wide  acceptance.  It's
WHATSFOR,  and  can be implemented on any system that is  running
XMODEM104 or later.

     If  you type the command 'WHATSFOR' with  no  parameters,  a
complete  listing of the database will be supplied,  including  a
short  description  of each file.  As large as some RCP/M's  are,
this file can be quite lengthy,  but since the last files entered
into the database are the first listed, you only need to read the
first entries to find out what the newest programs added do,  and
then abort the rest of the listing with a ^C.

     If you supply a parameter to the WHATSFOR command,  the file
descriptions will be searched for matches with the parameter, and
only those matching will be printed. For example,

A0>WHATSFOR SPREADSHEET

WHATSFOR - copyright 1985 by Irvin M. Hoff - 02/22/85
[type ^S to pause, ^C, ^X or ^K to abort, ? for help]

wait a moment...

CHALK.LBR

------------------------------  
[End of listing]

A0>


     You  could then use the command 'DIR CHALK.LBR $AD' to  find
out  which  drive/user area the file was located  on.  There  are
several  options  available  for  parameters,  and  entering  the
command 'WHATSFOR ?' will display the built in help file.

   B>WHATSFOR \M7
   B>WHATSFOR WPHL
   B>WHATSFOR .A?M

   If no string is included, all the file is shown.  A '|' allows
   numerous strings to be used at the same time.  '?' is used for
   "any character at this position".  A '\' fakes a line feed and
   looks only at the start of the filename line.

B0>


     There  is another fairly new RCP/M utility called  WHATSNEW,
and when used in conjunction with WHATSFOR, provides a very quick
method of finding out what the latest uploads are, where they are
located, and what they do.

     WHATSNEW  is  utility that will print out a listing  of  the
uploads  portion  of  the XMODEM log  file,  showing  all  recent
uploads,  where they are located, the time it took to upload, and
who uploaded it. For example;

A0:WHATSNEW

WHATSNEW Type ^S to pause, ^C, ^X or ^K to abort

wait a moment...

D/U    Filename   Size   Speed      Date    Time   Uploaded by

     After  you examined the WHATSNEW log file,  and have decided
that  one of the files appears interesting,  or you have no  idea
what it does,  use WHATSFOR.  If you wanted to find out what  the
file MBBS30.LBR was, you would enter the following command;

                           RCP/M GUIDE

   this board is running. One of the nicest packages currently
   available.

------------------------------
[End of listing]

A0>


     As  you may have noticed,  I did not have to type the entire
file name and extension for WHATSFOR to find the description.  If
there were any other file descriptions that contained the  string
MBBS30, their descriptions would have been listed.

     These  utilities makes any RCP/M system much easier to  use,
and it's amazing how little they are utilized by most callers. If
you are in the habit of calling RCP/M's long distance,  then they
can  save  you a considerable amount of time and  money.  If  the
system you use does not have these utilities online,  try to talk
the sysop into making them available.


2.04  HOW DO I GET IT ?

     Now  that you what the file does,  where it is located,  and
that  you want it,  you need to find some way to get it onto your
disk.  All of the systems that I know of use the same program  to
transfer files,  XMODEM.  It is very simple to operate, but gives
new users more problems than any other.

     There  are only a few options available,  and a list of them
can  be  obtained  by  entering  the  command  'XMODEM'  with  no
parameters, as shown in the next example.

A0>XMODEM

Time on system is 17 minutes.

XMODEM v106

Uploads files to A6: (1696k free space is available)
Private files to D14:

++ Examples of valid options ++
XMODEM S B1:HELLO.DOC      to send from a named drive/area

XMODEM L CAT.LBR CAT.COM   to send a file from a library
XMODEM L CAT CAT.COM       (.LBR extent may be omitted)
XMODEM R HELLO.DOC         to receive a file from you
XMODEM RP HELLO.DOC        to receive in a private area

XMODEM A                   to show areas/available space for uploads

(the "C" in RC or RPC receives via checksum rather than CRC)
(If you use R, it will switch from CRC to checksum mode after 5 retries)

A0>


     There are two ways to initiate a transfer TO you.  Use the S
parameter for normal files, and the L parameter for a file within
a library. Be sure that you are either logged onto the drive/user
area  where the file resides,  of specify it as part of the  file
name as shown in the above help file.


B0>XMODEM S KSMED.BAS

Time on system is 8 minutes.

XMODEM v106
File open: 30 records (4k)
Send time: 2 mins, 18 secs at 300 bps
To cancel: use CTRL-X numerous times

(Now is the time to do whatever your terminal program requires)

B0>


     After receiving the previous message, the file transfer must
be  started from your end.  How this is done is dependent on  the
terminal  program  that you are using.  For example,  if you  are
using MEX, you would enter a ^J, followed by E. You would then be
in the command mode,  and from the command prompt you would enter
the  command  'RT  KSMED.BAS'.  This tells MEX to  start  a  file
transfer,  it  will  be  receiving the  file,  its  to  be  named
KSMED.BAS and to return to terminal mode when finished.

                           RCP/M GUIDE                        


     When the file transfer is complete,  you will be returned to
the  drive/user prompt,  and the file will be on your  disk.  The
procedure  to follow for uploads is very similar,  except you use
either the R or RP parameter. The RP parameter is for uploading a
file to a private area for the sysop,  where other users will not
have access to it.  The procedure for MEX on a file upload  would
be almost identical to procedure followed for downloading, except
the command 'ST' would be entered from the MEX command prompt.



A0>XMODEM R TEST.OBJ


Time on system is 28 minutes.

XMODEM v106 (CRC is enabled)
File will be received on A6:

     XMODEM versions 104 and higher have built in support for the
WHATSFOR utility. If this feature has been implemented, after the
upload  is completed,  you will be prompted for a description  of
the file.  This description must be 7 lines or less,  and is  the
description that other users will see when using WHATSFOR.


2.05  MISCELLANEOUS COMMANDS


     There  are several more standard commands,  but they are all
simple to use. They will be covered in the following text.

     CHAT   - Used to page the sysop, and 'chat' with him.
     RBBS   - Used to enter the BBS.  To re-enter without relogging
              on, type RBBS P (sometimes will be MBBS).
     BYE    - Used to log-off the system.
     LUX    - A library utility used to log into a library file,
              contains its own documentation.
     TOS    - Time on system.
     FILE   - Used to locate the drive/user area a file is on.

     LUX is a library utility that allows "logging on" a  library
file,  and performing many of the standard RCP/M operations on an
individual library member.  To invoke LUX,  just type the command
LUX, followed by the library's filename. For example;


A0>LUX NULU11F1

LUX v4.2  as of 07-Oct-84


 LUX directory for NULU11F1.LBR

MLOAD23 .COM   3k : NULU11  .DQC  34k : NULU11  .NOT   1k
NULU11F1.COM  16k : NULUTERM.AQM   3k : NULU11F1.ASM   2k

This file contains 6 members in 445 active sectors for a total of 56k


[ in LUX   CTRL-C to exit, HELP for menu ]

A1:NULU11F1.LBR=>


     You  are  now  logged onto the  library  NULU11F1,  and  can
perform  many functions on the libraries individual  members.  To
obtain  a  short HELP menu,  just type HELP from the LUX  command
prompt.


A1:NULU11F1.LBR=>HELP

You are presently attached to a library file with the
LUX utility.  These are the available commands:

LUX      filename    - Attach to another LBR file
LUX   du:filename    - Attach to LBR file on specified du:
DIR, D, or SD        - Display attached library members
FILES                - Display other .LBR files on this du:
TYPE     filename.typ- Display ASCII file contents
CHEK     filename.typ- Run CHEK on requested member
CRCK     filename.typ- Run CRCK on requested member
SEND     filename.typ- Sends a library member file
XMODEM S filename.typ- Same as SEND command

     If  you wanted to 'TYPE' one of the members of the  library,
you  would  only  need to invoke the  command  TYPE  fn.ext,  for
example;


[ in LUX   CTRL-C to exit, HELP for menu ]

A1:NULU11F1.LBR=>TYPE NULU11.NOT


LUXTYPE  ^S pause, ^C aborts, ^X skips to next file   

Listing of member file: NULU11.NOT

2/1/85

Please let me know if you work with libraries that have in excess
of  200  members.   I am seriously considering some  future  NU(
upgrades  that would limit the maximum library size to  somewhere

                    (I aborted with a CTRL C)

[ in LUX   CTRL-C to exit, HELP for menu ]

A1:NULU11F1.LBR=>


     It  should  be noted that when you invoke  the  DIR  command
while in LUX, you will obtain a directory of the library, not the
currently  logged drive/user area.  To obtain a directory of  the
drive,  invoke the command 'FILES'. This will give a directory of
all library files on the currently logged disk. For example;


A1:NULU11F1.LBR=>FILES

Time on system is 07 minutes


 Drive A1:  files: 26  space used: 584k  (2056k free)

     You  can also perform xmodem transfers of individual members
while logged onto the library, and you do not have to exit LUX to
perform  them.  The  syntax for the transfer will differ  from  a
normal  xmodem library member transfer,  so be sure to  read  the
help file.

     Another useful utility available on some systems is  'FILE'.
It is used to locate a particular file(s) in the database, and is
easier to use than the 'DIR $AD' option.  For example,  to locate
all files that begin with the characters "MB";


A0>FILE MB*.*


FILE v21 - ^X to abort
searching...

 A0:MBBS    .COM   A4:MBYE36  .LBR   A6:MBYEOVL1.LBR  

A0>



     CHAT is a command used to page the sysop, and will allow the
sysop  and  the  user to communicate by entering  text  at  their
keyboards. For example;


A0>CHAT


CHAT v42
Hold on, SYSOP .....
Will page operator, use ^C or ^X to abort.
        |-------------------------|
Ringing: ...

Operator is available, please go ahead...
(Use ^C or ^X to exit and return to CP/M)


This is a demo of CHAT.

     I believe that covers most of the common RCP/M utilities. If
you  read  this manual carefully,  you should be able to  operate
effectively on any system.

2.06  HELPFUL HINTS

     If  you are attempting to use a utility on a file,  and  are
advised  that  the file does not exist,  make sure that  you  are
logged on the the drive/user area where the file is  located,  or
specify  the  drive/user  in  the  appropriate  location  in  the
utilities parameter.

     If  you are logging onto a system for the first  time,  have
your ASCII save buffer toggled on for the session so that you can
read  the important files offline,  and can familiarize  yourself
with the system commands and layout.

     Always try to locate and download a system directory so that
you  can  browse through it at your leisure,  and plan your  next
session in advance.

     When  you  leave a message in the BBS,  try not to  use  all
upper  or lower case,  as that makes it difficult for  others  to
read.

     Some RCP/M's have an input time-out feature where the system
will  drop you if there is no input from you for a set amount  of
time (around 2 minutes). If you are interrupted during a session,
and don't want to be dropped, just hit 'space', 'return' every 30
seconds  or  so.   Don't  do  this  for  too  long,  as  you  are
unnecessarily tying up the system.

     If  you are not a reasonably fast typist,  don't request  to
CHAT with the sysop, as it is very annoying to sit and wait while
the user hunts and pecks the keyboard and can only type one  line
per minute.

     Most  of  the utilities will give a listing of what  control
characters to use to skip, pause, or abort when they are invoked.
A general rule is that ^S will pause and restart,  ^X will  skip,
and  ^C will abort.  Some of the utilities will allow either  the
control sequence or the letter by itself.

     If you see a command that is available, and do not know what
it does, try invoking it with no parameters, or with a '?' as the
parameter.  That will usually display the utilities built in help
file (if one is available).

     Before  attempting to upload a file,  make sure that it does
not already exist on in the database.  For example, if you wanted
to upload a file called 'FINDBIOS.OBJ', enter the command
'DIR  FINDBIOS.* $AD'.  If the file is anywhere on the  disk,  it
will be located.  If the utility WHATSFOR is available,  it could
also be used.

     If  you  have logged onto a system at 1200  baud,  and  have
problems with line noise,  log off, and call back at 300 baud. If
you wanted to download a file,  wait till the problem clears  up,
and try again at 1200 baud.

  newer systems support 2400 baud. The higher the baud rate, the
  quicker the data is transferred.

BBS - Bulletin Board System. The program that allows the entering
  and reading of messages and bulletins.

BDOS - The Basic Disk Operating System. This portion of CP/M is

  operate as a remote terminal. Also is the command used to
  log off the system.

CCP - The Console Command Processor. The part of CP/M that
  handles user commands, and loading of programs.

CHAT - A command to page the sysop.

CHECKSUM - Another (older) error checking protocol. Less accurate
  than CRC.

CP/M - Control Program for Micro computers. The operating system
  under which most RCP/M's run.

CRC - Cyclic Redundancy Checking. An error checking protocol used
  by the latest terminal programs. Replaced the Checksum method.

DATABASE - The term often used to refer to the collection of
  programs contained on the systems assorted drive/user areas.

DIR - A command to display the contents of a drive/user area.

EXTENSION - The letters following the '.' in a file name. No more
  than three letters long.

  media, referenced by a specific name.

FILE TYPE - See EXTENSION.

I/O - Input/Output

LDIR - A command to display the directory of a library file.

MAP - A command available to print out a map of the drive/user
  areas of the system you are logged onto.
