    MD730C64 is a version of Irv Hoff's MDM730 modified for
the Commodore 64.  If you are unfamiliar with MDM730, you can
get a detailed description from the file MDM730.DQC in the
library MDM730.LBR.  This version works with the Hayes 300 
Smartmodem, the VICmodem and probably any other modem that
connects to an RS-232 port.  With the Hayes, you can use the
auto dial features of the program.

    MD730C64 will work ONLY with a 44k (or smaller) Commodore
64 CP/M system.  The RS-232 buffers and a character translation
table are located in the "extra" 4k.  If you try to work with
a 48k system, the program will crash.

Please note the following:

   1. Ctl-W (not Ctl-T) is used to start an ASCII file transfer
      in terminal mode.
   2. The program is currently set for pulse dialing with a
      Haye's Smartmodem.  If you have touch tone dialing, patch
      location 105H to be an ASCII 'P'.  It is currently a 'T'.
   3. There is no cursor when you are in terminal mode.  (You'll
      get used to it - honest!)
   4. The program has been tested at 300 baud.  Because of
      the interaction between the two processors, it may need
      more work to run correctly at 1200.

    This is an initial release and I would sincerely appreciate
hearing from you if you use the program.  Modifying MDM730 for
this computer was painful because of the way the C-64 handles its
RS-232 port.  It has been thoroughly tested but it is
a very complex program and there may be problems remaining simply
because there are combinations of functions that I am not aware of.
Please let me know if you incover any.  I'd also like to hear from
you if you use it and don't have problems.  When I have enough
confidence in the program,  I'll release the source code for
the overlay.
