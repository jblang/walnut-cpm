to PRINDLE AT NADC about XMODEM64.BUG

Sir:
I read the file you uploaded titled XMODEM64.BUG
It is in total error! Please have it deleated!
Before I uploaded the program XMODEM64.BAS I checked
to be sure there were NONE of the special Commodore
characters you talk about. They were all expressed as
CHR$(123) or whatever.  Ie. J$=CHR$(13) (return)
This program was written just so it could be uploaded
in this manner as was most of the program that uploaded it
no special reverse vidio characters appear anywhere in the
listing of this program no are any intended to.
Also the program was uploaded with XMODEM checksum protocall
That means that any 8 bit characters would have made the 
trip with no problems as XMODEM is an eight bit format
Please check your comments closer in the futher thanks
