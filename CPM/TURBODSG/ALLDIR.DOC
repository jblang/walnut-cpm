This is version 1.00 of ALLDIR.  Future updates will contain all features
described in the source file.

ALLDIR displays all files on all drives in all user areas, unless they
don't fit in RAM, in which case it only processes up to the file name that
filles the buffer.  The output is paged, sorted by name, user area and drive.

The .MAC file is supplied for reference only, some tools necessary for
reassembly have been left out.  Bug reports to your local RCPM sysop who
will forward them to SYSP CBBS, hopefully.

The other functions mentioned in the mAC file should be available in July
or August...
