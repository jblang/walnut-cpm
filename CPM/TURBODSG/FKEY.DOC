FKEY version 1.00
A creation of ESKAY Software (S. Kluger)
No Lefts Reversed

FKEY.REL and FKEY.O are modules designed to provide function keys under
TurboDOS.  FKEY.REL can hold a total of 255 bytes, which should
be sufficient for most applications. FKEY.O, the 16 bit version, can
hold 4095 bytes.

INSTALLATION
============

To install FKEY on your TurboDOS system, you are must have source to your
console driver (usually named CON96, entry point CONDR@).  Follow this
procedure for installation:

1. Add the FKEY symbol to your GEN file.
2. Set up the function keys in your PAR file.  The following is a sample
   8-bit PAR file (details omitted):

   LEADIN = "^A"	; leadin character (never gets printed!)
   FKEYS  = "1DIR",0D,0	; ^A1 = DIR
            "2WHO",0D,0 ; ^A2 = WHO
	    "QLOGOFF",0D,0 ; ^AQ = LOGOFF
            0FF		; endmark
   ; (you get the picture...)
   NOTE:
	It is your responsibility to not exceed 255 bytes!  There are
	two overhead bytes associated with each key, the key designator
	and the endmark.  If the total number of bytes defined at FKEYS
	is >255, the results are disasterous and may cause your system to
	not boot!
	The endmark (0FFH) MUST be present in the 16-bit version!!
	To DISABLE the fkeys, store a 0 at FKEY (PAR FILE: FKEY = 00)

3. Alter your CON96 file as shown below (detail omitted):

CONDR@::LD	HL,INITC		; get initialization complete flag
	LD	A,(HL)
	OR	A	     		; initialization complete flag set ?
	CALL	Z,CONINIT     		; no...initialize console channel
;
	LD	A,E	     		; get function number
	cp	1
	jr	z,cinhdl
	:
	:

cinhdl:	call	getfk##
	call	serial##
	jp	fkey##

   If installing the 16-bit version, alter CON96.A in the same fashion.

4. Re-GEN the modified SYS files reset and use the f-keys.

NOTE (again):
	Whatever character you set up to be the lead-in character will
	NOT be returned by the console driver!  If you do not use leadin
	as one of the f-key designators, you may hit the leadin char twice
	to send it.
