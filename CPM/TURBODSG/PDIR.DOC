PDIR stands for "Primitive DIRectory" and can only do one thing:
display the current directory.  It will display all files on the
current drive in the current user area.

The display is fast because it is unsorted and contains no size
information.  This of course means a step backward and puts it
on the same level as the built-in DIR command of CP/M, but for
a quick check of a disk it is ideal, especially since displaying
and sorting very large directories takes quite some time.

Another use would be in an outrageously large system where the
directory does not fit in RAM (yes, that IS possible!)
