DSKRAM is a RAM-disk emulator designed for 16 bit TurboDOS.

1. Installation

	Include DSKRAM in your slave GEN file, then replace STDSLAVE
	with STDSLAVX.  NOTE: you may have to remove RTCMGR from
	STDSLAVX.O; ask your OEM or dealer if you can't do it.
	In the slave .PAR file, two equates must be added and one
	must be changed.  NOTE: the MEMTBL equate may not be present
	in a 256k slave PAR file...

   Sample PAR files (relevant parts shown only):

   a. default configuration - 512k slave with 256k ram disk
      MEMTBL + 3 = (0x4000-0x50)	; set upper memory limit for OS
      SEGDSK = (0x4000)			; beginning segment for ram disk
      NUMSGS = 4			; 4 segments for ram disk (64k ea)

   b. 256k slave with 128k ram disk:
      MEMTBL + 3 = (0x2000-0x50)
      SEGDSK = (0x2000)
      NUMSGS = 2

   c. (the max) 1MB slave with 784k ram disk
      MEMTBL + 3 = (0x4000-0x50)
      SEGDSK = (0x4000)
      NUMSGS = 12

	Got the message, right?  Now, of course you have to add a
	DSKAST line to your sale PAR file, carefully skipping over
	drives that already exist, then change your master PAR file
	to allow everyone to access the new drive.  Here is a sample
	assuming the slave with the ram disk is #9:

      Slave:
      DSKAST = 0x80,(0),0x81,(0),0x82,(0),0,DSKDRA	; A,B,C on master,
      							; ram disk is D:
      Master:
      DSKAST = 0,DSKDRA,1,DSKDRA,0,DSKDRB,83,(9)	; A,B,C local,
							; D drive 4 on slv 9

2. Operation

	The ram disk driver is a bit intelligent in that once it is
	loaded and the drive has been set up, it will not reformat
	the drive after a slave reset unless the directory label
	entry is munched.
	When bringing up the ram drive, simply ERASEDIR it.  It is
	important that you make the directory HASHED, else the driver
	will erase the whole "disk" after a slave reset!

	The drive is set up to have 256 byte physical sectors with 4
	sectors per "track" and 256 directory entries.  It has as
	many "tracks" as there are k bytes assigned to it.


3. Bugs

	DSKRAM was a 2-hour creation, thanks to the simplicity of
	TurboDOS' disk driver requirements.  It has been tested
	and will continue to be tested.  if you turn up any bugs,
	please let me know at the address above.
