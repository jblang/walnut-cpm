DCHECK is a program which supplements the DUPCHECK utility of version
1.41 TurboDOS.  When DUPCHECK shows multiple allocation blocks, you
should run DCHECK.

DCHECK runs up to three passes across the directory, so it may run
for up to five minutes on a large hard disk.

On the first pass, it simply reads the current disk allocation map.
On the second pass, duplicate allocation blocks are collected and
unallocated blocks are displayed, along with the filename.
Only if there are any duplicate blocks will a third pass be performed,
which displays all duplicate block addresses and affected files along
with a recommendation as to remedy the problem.


A few notes...

- you might want to do a ATN-^P sequence before starting DCHECK to record
  its output to the printer, especially if DUPCHECK showed lots of errors.
- DCHECK will not run on any disk with less than 255 allocation blocks.
