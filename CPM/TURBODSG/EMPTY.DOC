EMPTY by ESKAY - 05/30/85

This simple program displays all user areas of the currently logged drive
which are empty.  Great for that big drive when you need an empty area
and don't remember who's got what.

This program works only with TurboDOS version 1.4x! Weird results if
you run it under pre-1.4 or (heaven forbid) CP/M!
