NSWPT version 2.05.24 / 11/16/85


Greetings, all TurboDOS users hungry for a SWEEP utility!

Thanks to Dave Rand and DISZILOG.COM, there now is a version of Dave's
very popular NSWP program available for 8-bit TurboDOS.

	NOTE:
		This program is neither supported nor authorized by
		Dave Rand.  You MUST NOT attempt to get him to help
		with problems.  If you experience problems or would
		like to make suggestions, have someone get the word
		out to any one  of the more popular TurboDOS remote
		systems and one day it'll appear with the changes!!

Now to the documentation....

May I first suggest that you somehow get a hold of Dave Rand's official
documentation.  The features of NSWPT conform to NSWP version 2.05 and
will NOT be brought to a higher original rev level.  The documentation
is quite lengthy and will answer any questions you may have.

The following is a description of the "new" features and assumes you ARE
somewhat familiar with NSWP or have at least read the documentation:

NOTE: "features" will be updated with new versions and may refer back
      to other TurboDOS-only features.

1.	NSWPT will only run on TurboDOS-Z80 version 1.3 and higher
2.	"D" and "E" commands now report messages if unable to delete
	a file due to it being open by another process, etc.
3.	"Y" command now correctly utilizes and reports TurboDOS
	attribute bit designations ("F" for FIFO and "GLB" for GLOBAL).
	To set to GLOBAL, use "G" where in CP/M you would use "S".
4.	"L" command flushes buffers on the current drive
5.	"P" command prints to default destination and signals end-of-print
	at the end of the print job.
6.	All commands allowing user numbers now accept all 32 user areas
7.	Drive still has to be specified before user, ie use "D17:"
	instead of "17D:".
8.	"C" and "M" command now preserve R/O and GLOBAL atrribute bits	(v14)
9.	New command "Z":						(v14)
	The "Z" command allows for changing a drive. After typing "Z",
	enter a valid drive letter and NSWPT will attempt to first flush
	all buffers, then lock the drive. If successful, you will be
	prompted to type any key to continue (the drive is locked at that
	time, allowing safe media changes).  If the drive cannot be freed,
	an error message will be generated.
10.	New command "G":						(v14)
	The "G" command allows execution of a .COM file. The file must be
	the current file (the one to the left of the cursor) and it must
	be of type .COM.  No arguments are allowed, and the file's execution
	will act upon the drive and user NSWPT was invoked from.
11.	New configurations made easy:					(v14)
	NSWPT is now supplied in .REL format along with NSWPT.GEN and
	NSWPT.PAR.  Use NSWPT.PAR to customize NSWPT for your terminal.
	For no features, delete NSWPT.PAR or comment out all its
	patch information.  NSWPT.PAR *must* be edited for your terminal
	if you intend to use it!
12.	Many instructions have been converted to Z80 code to keep	(v14)
	the size of NSWPT down to less than the original.
13.	"C" and "M" commands now display " (D)" if a copy results in	(v15)
	the destination file being overwritten.
14.	Any failed delete will now be properly reported.		(v15)
15.	Drives defined as remote and unreachable are now reported	(v16)
	with a fatal "Network Error".
16.	Compatibility flags are explicitly set to 0F8 on entry.		(v16)
17.	FIFO attribute set capability now removed from "Y" cmd.		(v18)
18.	Non-privileged users now receive an error message and are	(v19)
	returned to the OS.
19.	The system serial number is displayed on entry.			(v19)
20.	Significant code savings through elimination of unneeded	(v19)
	routines and partial conversion to Z-80 code.
NOTE:	VERSION 21,22 LOST TO DISK CRASH)
21.	Added status info about system (TD version, CP/M version,	(v23)
	network address). Made "G" command work with logged drive/user.
22.	Increased buffer zone at end of TPA to at least 256 bytes.	(v24)
	When destination disk full, buffers are now flushed.


FUTURE PLANS:

1.	More features.
2.	Translation to 8086 (rather than disassembling 16-bit version).


I'M SURE DAVE RAND GETS A BIT AGITATED ABOUT THIS, BUT HE'D REALLY HOLLER IF
I SUPPLIED SOURCE, SO NO SOURCE, FOLKS.  SORRY.
