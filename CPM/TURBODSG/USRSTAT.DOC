USRSTAT is a spinoff of EMPTY.  I was asked, "what if I want to find a
user area that's either empty or hase just a couple of files in it?"
and so here is USRSTAT...

It displays all 32 user areas, three across, versus the total number of
DIRECTORY ENTRIES used in each user area, and at the end shows the total
number of directory entries on disk, used and free.

Point of interest... a hashed disrectory should never be more than half full.
