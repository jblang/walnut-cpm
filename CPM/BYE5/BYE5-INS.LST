TOPIC: BYE5 inserts currently available for CP/M-80 systems

BYE5.ASM takes full advantage of the result codes returned by modems
using 'AT' protocol.  It uses the terse mode to recognize the speed of
the incoming signal and automatically adjusts the computer I/O to that
speed, without the user needing to type any CR's.  This is of particular
benefit for RCPM systems using the new 300/1200/2400 modems.  (For those
modems not supporting the 'AT' protocol, the caller will still need to
type enough CR characters to establish his speed.)

No external smartmodem inserts are needed, except for systems such as
the Cermetek or Pen-tel which use their own protocol.  The included
smartmodem routines also allow answering on first ring, with optional
echo-checking required by some modems for insured accuracy of command
accectance.

Occasionally some major feature is added to BYE which causes the name to
be changed.  BYE3 added automatic relocation of the program as an "RSX"
under CCP.  BYE5 permits using its hardware I/O and time clock functions
by KMD which then needs no additonal overlays for I/O or time functions.
(The name BYE4 had already been used.)

KMD not only does not need any inserts but also uses 1k protocol for
faster file transfers, especially for those having 2400 bps modems.  It
replaces XMODEM.  Both IMP and MEX114 support the 1k protocol while re-
taining the older XMODEM and Christensen protocols.  (KMD also has batch
mode available for all users.)

BYE5 and KMD are so easy to bring up, it will pleasantly surprise the
user.  Put the appropriate insert below into BYE5, set the equates to
suit (only 4-5 need be changed, if any, from the distribution version),
set the equates on KMD to suit (you may not need to change any) and you
should be up and running - often in less than a half-hour for installing
both programs.	Things have been tremendously simplified over earlier
versions of BYE, BYEII, BYE2 and BYE3, although the programs have gained
in versatility for unusual applications and for keeping the SYSOP in-
formed as to what is happening on his system.

					- Notes by Irv Hoff W6FFC


     REMEMBER:	These are inserts, not overlays.  They go into
		BYE5 at the area specifified by the ++++ char-
		acters, near the start of the program.

		These have all been renumbered and and renamed to
		six characters length to eliminate confusion with
		mainframe systems limited to six characters per
		filename.

		There is always a possibility of conflict with
		names selected for labels - if your assembler
		shows duplicate labels, it should be simple to
		select a different name in that event.
