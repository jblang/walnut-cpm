prefacesection(Purpose of this Manuscript)
This Manuscript is meant to exercise most of the features of Scribble
and Crayon to aid you in testing Scribbles and Crayons that you
develop. 
prefacesection(Creation Notice)Scribble and Crayon Test Manuscript by
begin(itemize)Created for Amethyst User's Group
August 13, 1981. [BAD]

Modified to remove some bugs in the formatting commands, generally
cleaned up the contents. Added some extra text so that Scribble and
Crayon problems I am aware of will be pointed up. September 5, 1981. [BAD] 

Much of the text was rearranged to more closely match the order of
certain sections of the new (1.3) Scribble manual. Several new
commands were added to the text. September 6, 1981. [BAD]

prefacesection(Usage)Once you get Scribble and Crayon configured to
work with your printer(s) run this manuscript thru Scribble/Crayon
(once for each printer type you have defined). Undoubtedly there will
be botches. Hopefully all of the botches will be due to improper
specifications in the CONFIG.DAT file. Once you get things working
right with this file, put a copy of each of the CORRECT outputs you
have created in a (safe) and handy place for future reference. This
will constitute the standard of comparison for the new
Scribbles/Crayons you will produce and submit to AUG. Hopefully all
future submissions for Scribble/Crayon extensions will be able to
format this manuscript as flawlessly (?) as the factory version(s). 

As you produce new environments, features and facilities, put tests of
them in this manuscript and try running it thru your new system. This
will give you a resonably effective test to see if your new features
work, and if they inadvertently gronk any other ones. 

This file is long for a reason: short files are not likely to exercise
Scribble or Crayon too hard. Weird things can often happen on the 25th
page (only if it's the second page of the index) that you would never
catch until you ran that all-important document off (and distributed
100 copies of it, before catching it). If you exercise all of the new
and old features at once (or at least most of them) you are more
likely to spot those bizarre 'interaction type' bugs while you are
still programming, and before you start trying to use the system.

This manuscript can also help you set up the CONFIG.DAT
file properly for your printers. I didn't get the paper size for my
printer just right until after I had been using Scribble/Crayon for
over four months.

\You may have trouble formatting this Manuscript with your
Scribble, since I use a 64K system, and I have made extensive use of
the features of Scribble that require lots of memory. It is possible
that you will not be able to use this manuscript if you have 56K, and
almost certain if you only have 48K. In Versions of Scribble 1.3 (and
later, I presume) you can specify how much space to reserve for end
stuff. This feature may well save you. This manuscript uses about 4400
bytes for the largest page and 2900 bytes for the end space when
formatted for a vanilla device.

In Scribble Version 1.0 this Appendix was B even though it was the

Appendix as A in the table of contents. Seems to work fine in Scribble
1.3.
appendixsection(General)
The Amethyst Users Group (AUG) is run solely to disseminate
information on the Amethyst package, and on systems and environments
in which that package may be run. The AUG is in no way affiliated with
Mark of the Unicorn, the originators of the Amethyst package, however,
Mark of the Unicorn retains a membership in the AUG so that hopefully
nobody is groping in the dark, so to speak. Any charges levied by the
AUG are accurate reflections, to the fullest extent possible, of the
costs incurred in the generation of the service provided. The AUG does
not and is not operated in order to make a profit, however the AUG is
b(not) a non-profit organization, since the term 'non-profit
organization' has specific legal meaning, and the AUG has not
qualified for this label and status. Therefore, donations to, and

Appendix(Bug Policy) While the Amethyst Users Group is an acceptable
forum for bug reports, I am certain that Mark of the Unicorn would
prefer that glaring errors in Amethyst be reported to them also,
rather than reading about them in the Amethyst Users Group newsletter
index(newsletter) first. Reporting the bug to Mark of the Unicorn
gets it fixed faster. Reporting the bug to Amethyst Users Group helps
the rest of us avoid situations that invoke the bug. So report bugs to
Mark of the Unicorn and Amethyst Users Group, or if you only have one
stamp, send it to Mark of the Unicorn, since they'll see that it gets
fixed, while I can't. I admit that I have been negligent on this count
once or twice, and I vow to abide by my own policy in the future.
