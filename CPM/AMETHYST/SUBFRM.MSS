Software  contributions are received  for  inclusion into
the  library with the understanding  that  the contributor
is  authorized to make the material  available to others for
their individual  non-commercial  use.  The Users Group
makes no representations as to the utility of the material
in the library for any purpose. Contributions should be
submitted on 8" single density diskettes in CP/M file format
or equivalent.  Please cross-reference  any rewrites or
bug-fixes to prior distributions. It is intended that this
form be filled out  with Mince,  and  left on the submitted
disk  for each  program.   (You may group similar programs
together).  All  commentary on how to fill the form out
should be deleted by the time you are finished. Remember to
keep an original of the form around for  submitting more
than one program. NEVER submit your only 'good copy' of
anything. The USPSnail can damage it, and we all lose.
