;;   PROGRAM: VDEPTCH3.ZEX
;;   AUTHOR:  Fred Haines
;;   DATE:    August 30, 1987
;;   PURPOSE: patch Eric Meyer's VDE v2.61 to install CTRL-V as down arrow key
;;            and CTRL-J as INSERT mode toggle.

;;   Version 3 - August 30, 1987
;;   adjusts the addresses to be poked to v2.61.  This patch works only†ç
;;   on v2.61.  Use VDEPTCH2.ZEX for v2.6.  †ç

;;   Version 2 - August 18, 1987
;;   corrects an error in VDEPTCH which led to bad behavior by the macro keys,
;;   ESC-n sequences, if the key was not programmed.  If you installed this
;;   patch from VDEPTCH, you can correct the error by changing the byte at
;;   062Eh from 16h to 0Ah.

;;   Video Display Editor v2.6 is copyrighted by its author, Eric Meyer, and,
;;   while it has been made freely available to the CPM community by its
;;   author, it may not be distributed in patched form.  You may patch your
;;   own copy of the program as you like, but please respect the author's
;;   copyright.

;;   Many popular terminals use a CTRL-V for the down arrow key instead of the
;;   more common CTRL-J.  While it is possible to specify a CTRL-V as the down
;;   arrow key when installing your terminal for VDE v2.6 with VINST v2.6,
;;   this interferes with VDE's use of CTRL-V to toggle INSERT mode on and
;;   off.  Patching the following three bytes solves the problem, changing CTRL-
;;   V to the down arrow and CTRL-J to the INSERT mode toggle.

;;   To install this patch - if you are running a Z System, put VDE.COM and
;;   ZEX.COM somewhere in the patch and issue this command:

;;      ZEX VDEPTCH3

;;   If you are not using a Z System, you can use EDIT, PATCH, EDFILE, or any
;;   standard patcher to change the three bytes shown below in the poke
;;   statements.
