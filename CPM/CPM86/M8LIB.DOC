M8LIB  -  Utility to change the phone number library entries in
	  Modem programs that contain the library as part of there
	  CMD file.

	  This version was tested with MDM830/86 and MODEM901/86
	  and may work for others.

	  M8LIB was translated from the 8080 version CHGLIB22 to
	  8086 code and renamed to M8LIB.  (It is similar to but
	  not identical to M7LIB as used with MDM730.)

	  Please report any changes/bugs to:

					P.O. Box 121
					Melbourne Beach, FL
