M8UPD-1.TXT  -	Update Number 1 for MDM830


The following has been brought to my attention by Harry M. Van Tassell:

	There is NO NEED for the MDM830 configuration utility as this
	can be done using PIP.

	The new precedure to configure MDM830 is now as follows:

	Assemble the overlay to MDM830 for your system using ASM86
	and concatenate the resulting .H86 file to MDM8xx.H86 using
	PIP.  E.G.:

	ASM86 M8GP-1
	PIP MDM.H86=MDM830.H86,M8GP-1.H86
	GENCMD MDM 8080 CODE[MFF0]

  similarly

	overlaying the Phone Number Overlay can be done
	by :

	ASM86 M8NM-30
	PIP MDMNEW.H86=MDM.H86,M8NM-30.H86
	GENCMD MDMNEW 8080 CODE[MFF0]

I have tried this procedure before Harry told me it works and could
not get it to create a proper CMD file. I found out why too! Here
it is:

NOTE:  IF YOU HAVE A DUAL PROCESSOR SYSTEM SUCH AS COMPUPROS 8/16
       SYSTEM OR THE DEC RAINBOW, MAKE SURE YOU USE THE 16 BIT
       VERSION OF PIP !! WHEN I FIRST EXPERIMENTED I HAD PIP.COM
       ON MY DEFAULT DRIVE AND PIP.CMD WAS NOT THERE... SO I ENDED
       UP WITH A CONCATENATED FILE ALRIGHT BUT THE END OF RECORDS
       RECORD WAS STILL IN THE NEW H86 FILE. SO I GUESS (DOES ANYONE
       KNOW FOR SURE ??) THAT THE 16 BIT VERSION OF PIP TAKES H86
       FILES AND TREATS THEM SPECIAL BY REMOVING THE LAST RECORD
       IN THE FIRST FILE !?!
