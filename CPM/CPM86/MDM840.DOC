INTRODUCTION:
------------

     MDM840 enables a computer to communicate with another computer.
This is normally done by using standard telephone lines but with special
audio tones sending serial data.  Two common speeds are used, depending
on the facilities available -- 300 Baud or 1200 Baud.  A "modem" is used
which provides these audio tones.  This is an acronym for "modulator and
demodulator".  The one section (modulator) provides the audio tones for
sending over the telephone line and the other section (demodulator) then
converts those audio tones back to digital pulses the computer uses to
receive the incoming data.

     The modem itself is a hardware utility, usually costing around $75
to $200 for a typical 300 Baud device and from $250 to $800 for a system
offering 1200 Baud as well as 300 Baud.  Some of these (such as the PMMI
S-100 modem board) plug directly into the computer itself, while others
are totally independent of the computer and use an interconnect cable
(usually a RS-232 type) to control the external modem.	A Bell 212A is
an excellent example of this type modem.  Other examples would include
the Racal-Vadic, Hayes Smartmodem, U. S. Robotics, Signalman Anchor, etc.

     The program discussed in this guide allows each computer involved
to directly control its own modem, converting DC pulses into audio tones
which are sent to (or received from) the telephone line.  (The standard
1200 baud transmissions use "DPSK" (dibit phase shift keying) instead of
"AFSK" (audio frequency shift keying).

     For short distances, no modems are required as the computer can
provide the necessary digital voltages.  This discussion is centered
around systems intended for use over distances ranging from several
miles to literally around the world.



FEATURES:
--------

     A program to communicate with another computer can range from very
simple to very complex.  MDM840 is one of the more complex such programs
available today.  It started in 1977 as a relatively simple program.  It
was called MODEM at that time.	It was intended to be used primarily as
a means of exchanging programs with other people in other cities.  Since
that time a number of other (very useful) features have been added, in
addition to improved methods of program transfer.  A list of some of the
features offered by this particular program include:

  1)  Ability to talk with another computer via keyboard at each end.
	  (Called the "terminal mode".)
  2)  Ability to operate a remote mainframe computer such as TYM-SHAR,
	  or special data bank systems now commonplace.  This includes
	  "bulletin board" systems for receiving, sending or just read-
	  ing messges or other types of information.
  3)  Ability to upload (send) or download (receive) programs from other
	  computers whether TYM-SHAR, data banks, remote hobby systems
	  or just another individual in another location.
  4)  Ability to copy incoming information on a printer.  If the print-
	  er is too slow to copy the data directly, the extra characters
	  back into a large storage buffer until they can be printed.
  5)  Ability to copy incoming data into memory for automatic transfer
	  to a disk file.
  6)  Accomodates any computer clock speed up to 25.5 MHz. in 0.1 Mhz.
	  increments for uniform results.  (The clock speed is actually
	  of modest interest, it is only used for setting timing loops.)
  7)  Advanced type of error detection (CRC or Cyclic Redundancy Check)
	  using automatically generated high-speed lookup tables.
  8)  Ability to send any of 11 different pre-programmed function keys.
	  (These keys are very easy to reset, using a special external
	  program.)
  9)  Automatic disconnect from the telephone line when using CTL-N, or
	  "X" as an option during file transfer.  Two other disconnect
	  commands with the PMMI modem.
 10)  Additional features of special interest to those using the PMMI
	  103 S-100 plug-in modem, the U. S. Robotics 300/1200, the
	  Anchor Signalman Mark XII, the Hayes Smartmodem 300 or 1200
	  or other "Hayes-compatible" modems.  Those features basically
	  include automatic dialing and redialing (if requested) until
	  the other computer finally answers.

	       a) Automatic selection of a particular phone number from
		  a library of names and numbers.  (These phone numbers
		  can be very easily changed by using a special external
		  program.)
	       b) Automatic dialing for alternate long-distance systems
		  (where auto-dialing touch-tone modems are used).
	       c) Entry of a hand-typed number.  Although it might be as
		  simple to manually dial the number as hand-type it, it
		  can then be automatically redialed indefinitely.
	       d) Auto-linking of 1-32 different numbers for continuous
		  dialing until one of the group is available.
	       e) Choice of beeping continuously when connected to get
		  the operator's attention, or beep one time and go to
		  terminal mode immediately to catch UNIX or IBM signon
		  messages that assume you can copy when connected.


USING THE PROGRAM THE FIRST TIME:
--------------------------------

     For now, we shall assume the program is ready to use on your equip-
ment.  (Normally the user must make some modest changes to the program
before it can be used.	This includes changing the port numbers and some
other personal options.  These will be covered later in the section that
describes how to adapt it to your equipment.)

     When the program is brought up is shows this display (if using the
PMMI modem):

	  MDM840 - (type M for Menu)
	  Version for PMMI S-100 modem starting at port: C0H

	  B>>COMMAND: x

       The cursor stops at point "x:" waiting for some sort of command.
Typing a "M" followed immediately by a RETURN, shows the first page of
a 4-page help guide.  If you do not have a PMMI modem, you would have
seen this (or a customized heading for your particular equipment):

	  MDM840 - (type M for Menu)
	  Version for Non-Pmmi modem

	  B>> COMMAND:

     In this case only a 3-page help guide is used, since the 4th page
is used to assist those with the PMMI modem.  It tells them a little
about changing from originate to answer mode, how to change Baud rates,
how to disconnect, etc.

     Several commands are similar to those already used for CP/M, such
as 'ERA', 'DIR' and the ability to change disk drives and user areas.
This adds tremendous flexibility while remaining in the modem command
mode.  To change disk drives, just say:

	  B>>COMMAND: A: <RET>

     and you are in the same user area on the A: drive.  You can also
say:
	  A>>COMMAND: A: 12 <RET>

     to change user areas.  When finished (using this example), say:

	  A12>>COMMAND: CPM  <RET>

     and you will go back to CP/M with the original driver and user area.

OPTIONS:
-------

     There are 6 primary options and 13 secondary options that may be
typed on the command line.  In additon there are over 35 commands ranging
from single character to three characters that can be used (such as DIR,
ERA, LOG, etc.)  Those are listed on the menu.	(The exact number varies
depending on whether you have the PMMI modem, etc.)


     Primary Options:	 E, L, M, R, S, T
	  E = Echo mode (special type of full duplex)
	  L = Local modem (no remote echo, half duplex)
	  M = Menu display showing features that are available
	  R = Receive a file from remote facility
	  S = Send a file to a remote facility
	  T = Terminal mode (full duplex, echo provived remotely)

     Secondary Options:  A, B, D, J, O, Q, R, S, V, X, 0, 1
	  A = Answer mode (used only by PMMI modems)
	  B = Batch mode -- allows automatic multiple file transfer
		(This is normally only used from modem-to-modem as
		no RCP/M system supports batch mode file transfers.)
	  D = Disconnect when done, stay in MDM840
	  J = Command mode when finished with a file transfer
	  O = Originate mode (used only by PMMI modems)
	  Q = Quiet mode, special purpose feature rarely used except if
		 operating through a "BYE" program.
	  R = Receive data shown on CRT during file transfer
	  S = Send data shown on CRT during file transfer
	  V = Visual inspection of an ASCII file being transferred.  Not
		 often used as most ASCII files are now "squeezed" for
		 minimum transfer time and disk space.
	  X = Exit to CP/M  when finished, disconnect from phone line
	  0 = Odd parity (PMMI modem)
	  1 = Even parity (PMMI modem)


     Although you can get the following information from the help guide
in MDM840 itself, showing it here will allow us to discuss the various
features in somewhat better detail.

DISCUSSION OF HELP GUIDE PAGE 1:
-------------------------------

     There are basically three types of commands that may be used with
this program:
	     1)  Single-letter commands shown on page one.
	     2)  Three-letter commands shown on page 2, and
	     3)  Control-<char.> commands shown on page 3.

     Going down the list:

  ? - shows current parameters.  As these are closely tied in with some
	  of the other options, we shall show a typical example later
	  in this discussion.
  ^ - shows the function key intercept character.  This may be easily
	  changed using an external program.  (You may prefer 'escape'
	  or some seldom used control-character.)

	  NOTE:  typing this character while in the command mode will
		 display all the programmable function key definitions
		 with the exception of the log-on string which uses
		 CTL-L.

  M - shows the menu a page at a time.	You may abort after any page is
	  shown with a control-C.
  E - terminal mode with echo.	When talking with another terminal also
	  also using MDM840 (or a comparable program), one of you must
	  send an "echo-back" so you can both see what the other person
	  is typing.  This is needed for full-duplex operation.  Usually
	  the person originating the call will type "E" instead of "T".
	  However either may do this.  If "both" use the echo mode, the
	  program usually starts typing a string of feedback characters
	  since both computers are re-sending the same character over
	  and over.  You can stop this by just returning to command mode
	  (type control-E) and then retyping "T" rather than "E".
  L - terminal mode with local echo.  Shows what you are typing but does
	  not send an echo of the other person's typing back to him.
	  Can be used at both ends, in place of one person using "E".
	  Both "E" and "L" are useful at times for some types of modems
	  that do not use full-duplex, or for some main frame units that
	  run half-duplex.  The combination of "T", "E" and "L" gives an
	  excellent choice to use on various systems.  Normally the "T"
	  mode is sufficient except when talking with another person and
	  then the "E" mode at one end or "L" mode at both ends will
	  provide normal results.  If the remote system does not supply
	  a LF after a CR, you can get that from the 'TLF' command.
  T - puts the program directly into "terminal mode", allowing it to
	  send from the keyboard to the other computer, and to copy any-
	  thing coming from the other computer with the exception of
	  file transfers (use "R" to receive those).
  R - used only for receiving files from the other computer.  These are
	  usually sent in binary form with either checksum verification
	  or more commonly, CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Checking).  If ready
	  to receive another file, you have several choices, depending
	  on the program used by the other computer.   After notifying
	  him you are ready (or will be very shortly), you can type:

	       B>>COMMAND: R HELLO.DOC <RET>

	  and when he starts to send, you will receive the program which
	  then goes directly to the disk.  You could also have said:

	       B>>COMMAND: RB <RET>

	  This is called the "Batch mode" and is an extremely useful way
	  to receive programs automatically, from another computer using
	  a similar program.  He will use the batch mode for sending the
	  programs and that automatically provides the file names at the
	  receiving end.  In this manner, large numbers of programs can
	  be transferred completely automatically, including full disks.
	  (Assuming you care to pay the toll calls for the time it will
	  take!)

	  NOTE:  The ideal way to receive batch mode would be:

	       B>>COMMAND: RB <RET>

		 since you may not know in advance how many programs he
		 will be sending.

	       NOTE:  While receiving a file, any errors will be shown
		      on the console CRT, indicating that portion of the
		      program is being repeated.  If the file finishes
		      transferring normally, it will have been received
		      error-free.  Those error notices are merely to let
		      the user know a momentary problem caused a resend.
		      The error messages indicate phone line quality.

  S - used only to end programs.  Similar to "R" but sends instead of
	  receives.  If the other system is ready to receive, you could
	  then type:

	       B>>COMMAND: S HELLO.DOC <RET>

	  It will tell you how many records are involved and how many
	  minutes and seconds it will take to send the program.  If the
	  other system is ready to receive, it starts the transfer,
	  showing how many records have been sent.  If any errors occur
	  during transmission, it shows what they are and counts them.
	  It will resend any records not correctly received at the other
	  computer.  If too many consecutive errors occur (normally set
	  at 10), the transfer is terminated.  The 'batch mode' may also
	  be used for sending:

	       B>>COMMAND: SB HELLO.*		 (sending batch mode)

	  will send all files starting with HELLO, or can send just one
	  file, or can send several non-related files in this manner:

	       B>>COMMAND: SB HELLO.DOC XDIR.COM TERM.*

	  etc.	Be sure to put a space between the various files.  You
	  can include the 'X' option:

	       B>>COMMAND: SBX HELLO.* MDM840.LBR MDM840.AQ6

	  When the file transfer is completed it disconnects from the
	  phone line and reverts to CP/M.  This allows you to be absent
	  when the file is finished, offering an advantage when sending
	  lengthy files.

DISCUSSION OF HELP GUIDE, PAGE 2:
--------------------------------

  CPM - This returns to normal CP/M use, abandoning MDM840.  It does not
	  do a warm reboot unless selected on your overlay, saving time.

	  CAUTION: It does not disconnect the modem from the phone line,
		   which allows intentional return to CP/M temporarily.

  DIR - Enables the user to see the library of any disk without needing
	  to return to CP/M first.  Can be adjusted when installing the
	  program to show 3, 4, or 5 groups depending on the width of
	  your CRT display.  Normally set to 5 for 80-column displays.
	  Shows the amount of disk spacing remaining on the logged-in
	  default drive.  (You must log in any drive you wish to write
	  on, or to see the correct free disk space remaining.)  See the
	  LOG feature below.
  ERA - Enables the user to erase any files from any disk without the
	  need to return to CP/M first.  Wild cards (* and ?) accepted.
  LOG - When a new disk is inserted, you can see the directory and read
	  files from it but cannot write to it without getting a "BDOS
	  ERR".  This command allows you to log in a new disk so you can
	  immediately write on it without first returning to CP/M for a
	  warm boot.  You can select drive and user number.  (This also
	  enables DIR to show the correct free disk space remaining.)
	  You can say:
			 LOG <RET> for same drive, user area, new disk
			 LOG A
			 LOG A:
			 LOG A14     (user areas are 0-15)
			 LOG A11:

  SPD - Sets the delay between characters and/or delay between lines in
	  the "T" mode when using control-T to upload a pre-typed file.
	  Since most bulletin boards and TYM-SHAR systems normally use
	  line editors that require a delay after they have received a
	  line, you can add delay between characters (in increments of
	  10 ms.) and/or enter delay between lines (in increments of 100
	  ms.).  This is preset for most systems at 50 and 500 ms.  They
	  can be changed at any time.  Current values can be checked by
	  using the  " ? " command.
  TIM - This option lets you set the file transfer time from 110 Baud to
	  9600 Baud.  You can preset it (when installing the program) to
	  the value normally used, but at times it is nice to be able to
	  conveniently change the time shown to a different rate.  Some
	  initialization routines (discussed in the install section) can
	  make this change automatically.  This command does not show if
	  using the PMMI* board as the speed is automatically changed to
	  agree with the current Baud rate selection.  It also does not
	  show if the custom overlay uses the SET command to choose var-
	  ious Baud rates as the transfer time is changed automatically.
  TCC - Most modem programs originally used simple checksum verification
	  of received sectors.	Most now use Cyclic Redundancy Checking
	  which finds certain transmission errors the simple checksum
	  system might overlook.  This toggle allows the user to select
	  checksum for those systems known to not offer CRC.  When set
	  normally to CRC, the program automatically switches to check-
	  sum after trying several times to use CRC.
  TLC - Nearly all computers use "control-characters" to do various
	  tasks such as move the cursor around, clear the screen, reboot
	  the system, etc.  You might want to send a control-E character
	  to the local computer and not have it go to the remote system
	  at the same time.  Say a moment later you would like to send a
	  control-E only to the remote computer.  You would do this:

	       control-E	      (goes to local computer only)
	       control-^ control-E    (goes to the remote computer only)

	  You can reverse the TLC toggle causing this response:

	       control-E	      (goes to remote computer only)
	       control-^ control-E    (goes to the local computer only)

	  All other control-chars. would operate in a similar manner.
	  This gives extra flexibility in using this program for special
	  systems like TYM-SHAR, etc.

	  NOTE:  If using control-^ is awkward, you can pick a different
		 character when installing the program initially.

  TLF - If sending a file while in terminal mode (via CTL-T option) most
	  mainframe computers will not want you to send a line feed.  As
	  all editors include the LF after CR, you have the option with
	  this toggle of sending or not sending a line feed.  If typing
	  manually in the "T" mode, you can get a line feed with CTL-J.
	  It is automatically included after CR with "L" or "E" modes.
  TRB - Allows the rubout char. to be changed to backspace if desired.
  TXO - Used when uploading pre-typed text files to other systems such
	  as TYM-SHAR or bulletin boards, etc.	Most of those have line
	  editors that take a moment to move the line you just finished
	  from their edit buffer into memory.  The XOFF character halts
	  your system from sending until it is ready for a new line.
	  Used only in the terminal mode.
  NUM - Not shown if using PMMI*.  This shows the non-PMMI* people the
	  phone library numbers which can be used for manual dialing.
  SET - Not shown if using PMMI, or if SETUPR is set to "NO" (indicating
	  no user routine in the overlay for choosing different speeds.)
  BYE - Disconnects the modem from the phone line, closes any file that
	  may be open and returns to CP/M.
  CAL - PMMI* command, shows the phone library for auto-dialing.  If not
	  using a PMMI*, this will not be shown, instead NUM is shown.
	  It displays the telephone library.  (Non-PMMI users will find
	  the NUM display beneficial as it can display useful phone num-
	  bers for manual dialing.)

	NOTE:  Use the phone number overlay to easily change the numbers
	       that are stored.  This overlay also accesses up to two
	       alternate long distance dialing systems for the touch-
	       tone auto-dialing modems.  You can also use an external
	       program called M7LIB to rapidly change any phone numbers.

  DSC - Disconnects the modem from the phone line whenever selected.
  DEL - If copying incoming information into memory, and you decide you
	  do not want to bother saving it to disk after all, this closes
	  (and then deletes) the disk file you had opened.
  WRT - saves what you have been copying to the disk file already opened
	  for that purpose.  When returning from the "T" mode to command
	  mode, a warning is shown that you may lose what has been saved
	  unless you use WRT (write to disk).

DISCUSSION OF HELP GUIDE, PAGE 3:
--------------------------------

  CTL-@  - Sends a break character to the other computer.  Used in some
	     TYM-SHAR systems, etc.  (Used only in PMMI mode)
  CTL-B  - PMMI command, changes the Baud rate from 110-710, in addition
	     changes the file transfer time accordingly.
  CTL-E  - Returns to command modem from "T", "L", "E" modes.
  CTL-L  - Will send the log-on message if TRANLOGON is set YES and a
	     message has been included in the LOGON area.  Can use this
	     feature to sign on various bulletin board systems, although
	     that would require an identical password on each.
  CTL-N  - Disconnect the modem from the phone line.  (CTL-D had been
	     used for this command, but it was too easy to accidently
	     type CTL-D when expecting to hit CTL-S or CTL-E or CTL-X.
	     You can easily change this to whatever you like in the
	     overlay you use for your equipment.)
  CTL-P  - Toggles the printer on-off.	Very useful feature.  Similar to
	     normal control-P but in this case if the modem is running
	     faster than normal printer speed, the characters just back
	     into a special buffer while the printer tries to catch up.
	     Most dot matrix printers are considerably faster than most
	     telephone modems, however.  Can be toggled at any time you
	     are in the "T", "L" or "E" modes.	Often used to copy items
	     from bulletin boards, etc. that are not worth permanently
	     saving on disk.
  CTL-Y  - Used only in terminal mode.	If a file was opened prior to
	     going to "T" (terminal) mode, nothing will be saved until
	     control-Y is typed.  This places a ";" (semicolon) at the
	     start of each new line, indicating the memory is "hot" and
	     is now copying for saving to a file.  You can toggle this
	     off by using control-R.

	   NOTE:  To open a file use:  COMMAND: T FILENAME.EXT <cr> and
		  then CTL-Y and CTL-R will control what is copied to
		  be placed in that file.

  CTL-R  - Stops the copy into memory, shuts off the ";" at start of
	     each line.  These two commands (CTL-Y to start, and CTL-R
	     to stop) control what is being saved.  When returning to
	     command (via CTL-E), you will then be warned to save the
	     information to disk via the WRT command or it will likely
	     be lost.  (You may never use CTL-R although CTL-Y is re-
	     quired to commence saving to memory for the disk file you
	     previously opened.)

		    (These commands -- CTL-P, CTL-Y and CTL-R give
		    MDM840 tremendous versatility.  You can copy
		    incoming data either to disk or to printer (or
		    both).  My own printer is a 300 Baud Teletype
		    Corporation Model 43, yet it works great when I
		    am using the Bell 212A at 1200 Baud.  The printer
		    falls behind, but misses nothing as it eventually
		    catches up with the contents of the large buffer.)

THE HELP GUIDE, SPECIAL PMMI PAGE:
---------------------------------

      Additional Subcommands for PMMI Modems

Modem control:
  A - Answer tone for send or receive
  O - Originate tone for send or receive

Parity options:
  1 - Set and check for odd parity
  0 - Set and check for even parity
	 Both ends must be capable of these options
	 which are available only in R and S modes.
	 The parity checking will be part of the
	 file transfer protocol.

Speed Options:
      After entering your primary and secondary options,
      you can set the modem speed by placing a "." after
      the options followed by the speed e.g., 300, 1200.

      EXAMPLE:	SBOT.600 will set the modem for 600 baud

DISCUSSION OF HELP GUIDE, SPECIAL PMMI PAGE:
-------------------------------------------

     When using MDM840 with the PMMI board, you will either dial out or
(far less likely) answer some incoming call.  Since the unit will be in
"originate mode" about 98% of the time, it is set to automatically come
up in the originate mode at default speed (300 Baud) whenever a call has
been completed.  If you want to use answer mode, you need to use the "A"
command.  If a speed is not included, it will stay at the default speed.

     Until a connection has been made, there are no tones applied to the
line.  Originate tones at 300 Baud are automatically added at that time.

     In addition to telling the PMMI modem if it should use originate or
answer tones, you can tell it what Baud rate to use.  A typical command
(once connection is made to another modem) would be:

	       B>>COMMAND: O.600 <RET>

     This puts the tones on the phone line for originate and at the
same time sets the PMMI board for 600 Baud.   Another typical response
might be:

	       B>>COMMAND: RAB.450 <RET>

     This places the answer tones on the phone line, sets the program
for receiving batch mode at 450 Baud.  It returns to the terminal mode
when the transfer is completed.

     Other optional PMMI commands seem self-explanatory, such as dis-
connect, etc.

PMMI, ANCHOR, HAYES AND ROBOTICS AUTO-DIALING AND AUTO-REDIALING:
----------------------------------------------------------------

     There are several very useful and versatile features offered for
the PMMI, Anchor, Hayes and Robotics users.  These include alternate
long distance dialing systems.

     There are several ways to auto-dial.

	  1) from the command line
	  2) from the phone number library line

     In addition you can auto-redial from either of these lines.  Once
the number has auto-dialed and there is no answer, it will ask you if
you want it to continuously auto-redial until it does receive an answer
(or you decide to abort).

     To get the phone library, type CAL <ret> on the command line.  You
then normally just type the alphabetic character at the start of the ap-
propriate line.  It will show the number being dialed.	You can also do
this from the main command line if you know in advance what alphabetic
character is associated with that particular number:

	       B>>COMMAND: CAL P <RET>

     This calls up the "P" line in the library and dials that number,
then if busy asks if you want it to continue redialing.  You can use:

	       B>>COMMAND: CAL 313-749-6569 <RET>

     and it will dial the number specified.  You can then do either of
these on the library command line, as well.  This gives a tremendous
versatility.

NOTE:	To access the alternate long distance dialing systems (up to two
	are offered), use the phone number overlay and fill in the infor-
	mation regarding your access number, billing number, etc.  It
	will then show how to enter a special character ahead of each
	phone number where alternate long distance system is desired.
	This only works where touch-tone systems are in use.

AUTO-LINKING PHONE NUMBERS:
--------------------------

     If the number you want to dial is busy, you would like to have it
automatically redialed until it answers.  However, you might like to
call any of a group of numbers and be happy to take whichever one first
becomes available.  Auto-linking allows a group of numbers to be listed
and they are then continuously dialed one after the other, until one is
available.

     MDM840 permits from 1-32 numbers to be linked together in any way.
There are two options:

	   B>>COMMAND: CAL A,D,R,3,Z	     1)
	   B>>COMMAND: CAL F,		     2)

	   B>>COMMAND: CAL A/D/R/3/Z	     3)
	   B>>COMMAND: CAL F/		     4)

	   B>>COMMAND: CAL A,D,A,R,A,3,A,Z   5)

	   B>>COMMAND: CAL F		     6)


	1) using a comma (,) will beep continuously when connected to
	   the first available number - touching any key stops the beep
	   and goes to terminal mode.

	2) just the one number is linked to itself and redials until
	   connected.  Beeps continuously until stopped with any key.

	3) using a slash (/) will beep only once when connected and then
	   automatically go directly to terminal mode - this is useful
	   where some mainframes such as IBM and UNIX send a logon note
	   assuming you are already able to copy as soon as connected.

	4) just the one number is linked to itself and redials until
	   connected.  Beeps only once and goes to terminal mode.

	5) illustrates how one number can be given top priority.

	6) system used previously - if connected on first try, beeps one
	   time and jumps directly to terminal mode.  If no connection,
	   asks the operator if he wants to try again or try continuous-
	   ly until a connected is made - at which time it beeps until a
	   key is depressed.

CASCADING COMMANDS:
------------------

     Several commands may be used on the same line.  Ones normally used
are:  A, B, D, E, J, L, O, Q, R, S, T, V, X (and Baud rate if PMMI).

     A typical PMMI selection might be: RABQJ.300

     The commands have been listed previously but will be listed here
again:

	A) answer tones for PMMI S-100 modem, puts tones online.
	B) batch mode  (must be used at both ends if used at all)
		(usually only available modem-to-modem with operators
		present at each end.)
	E) echo mode for conversing with a system not offering echo.
	J) will return you to the command mode after a file transfer.
	L) local echo shows what you are sending if no remote echo.
	O) originate tones for PMMI S-100 modem, puts tones online.
	Q) quiet mode, suppresses messages on local console.
	R) receive file transfers with CRC or checksum protocol.
	S) send file transfers, also shows transfer time.
	T) terminal mode - operates computer at other end like a remote
	      terminal.  Also stands for "text mode".  When in "T" mode
	      you can copy incoming to printer or to disk, and send pre-
	      typed ASCII text files via CTL-T.
	V) visual -- lets you see incoming ASCII files while being sent
	      to the disk system.

	NOTE:  The Baud rate is only used for the PMMI S-100 modem.
	       Many of the custom overlays allow use of the SET
	       command to change Baud rate with non-PMMI modems.

DISCUSSION OF TYPICAL PARMETERS SHOWN BY THE "?" COMMAND:
--------------------------------------------------------

     By this time, most of these parameters are self-explanatory.  They
primarily show how the options and toggles have been set.  The user can
check on any of the major parameters at any time by:

	  1) Typing control-E to return to command mode and
	  2) Typing  ?	to see the list of current parameters.

FUNCTION KEYS:
-------------

     There are 10 function keys which may be easily programmed with an
external file called M8FNK.CMD in just a few moments.	It makes the
changes directly to the MDM840.CMD file.  (There is an additional CTL-L
log-on selection that is programmable in your overlay.)

     To view the contents of the function keys, type 'M' for menu while
on the command line and it will show the character currently used for
the function key intercept.  (It will be '^' unless you select another.)
You could then type that character (followed by <CR>) on the command
line and it will display the entire contents of the function keys.

CHANGING THE PHONE NUMBER LIBRARY:
---------------------------------

     The phone numbers in the library may be easily changed using an
external file called M8LIB.CMD.  This permits any of the 36 phone num-
bers to be changed in only a few seconds.  It works directly on the
MDM840.CMD file.  If extensive changes are to be made, you may prefer
to use an overlay file called M8NM-40.A86.  This permits using your
editor to make quick and selective changes, or to substitute an entire
new library.  (You may need to add or remove things like '1-' for long
distance dialing in your area.)  That file also is used to set the
alternate long-distance dialing routines for SPRINT, MCI, TYMNET, etc.

RETRY OPTION:
------------

     The consecutive error limit has been set to 10.  When transferring
files from RCPM systems their XMODEM program aborts should this limit be
reached.  Each overlay has an option previously called ACKNAK.	This has
bee renamed to RETRY.  It should be set NO if working RCPM systems or
other computers with a program similar to MDM7.

     If using large mainframe computers (such as ARPANET), they do get
busy at times and will not accept additional information.  This may give
timeout errors at your end, but not at the mainframe.  If RETRY is set
YES, after 10 consecutive errors it then asks if you wish to reset the
error counter and keep trying.	It should take some 100 seconds to get
10 consecutive errors in this situation.

INSTALLING THE PROGRAM:
----------------------

     Although this is obviously the very first thing that needs to be
done, it was saved until last for several reasons.  The most important
of these was the need to first explain what some of the options will do
when selected.

     By this time the user should have a fairly good idea what options
would work best for him.  When looking at the beginning of the program
where the these are selected, it should now be rather easy to pick the
ones that are most useful.

     There are various ways to change the program to suit a specific
user.  You are offered several methods.  The "easy way" is to get the
MDM840.H86 file plus the appropriate overlay for your computer.  You
then edit the overlay (if needed) to suit your local needs, assemble it
to get a .H86 file then use the simple instruction and PIP.CMD to com-
bine the standard MDM840.H86 file with your overlay.  The front end of
each overlay contains all the information in the front of the MDM840
source code itself. By using PIP as follows: PIP MDM.H86=MDM840.H86,M8OVL-1.H86
(M8OVL-1 is the overlay for your computer and may have a different name.)
the front end information is actually appended to the main MDM840.H86 file
and later overlayed by using GENCMD to generate the MDM.CMD file as follows:
GENCMD MDM 8080 CODE[MFF0].  You now have the MDM.CMD file which you
can run by typing: MDM

     Generally no changes need to be made in specific overlays unless
you have some particular requirement different from others using the
same equipment.  (Such as the log-on message, for example.)  You may
also wish to say "YES" to the AUTODIAL question, which might be cur-
rently set "NO".

     The "hard way" would be to get the 180k MDM840.A86 source code and
then edit it to suit.  This is likely to be quite unsatisfactory for most
users as it will not contain the information peculiar to your computer
(which is in the individual overlay you select otherwise.)

     Thus various methods are available, one of which should provide the
easiest method for your system.

NOTE:	Although designed with special emphasis on the auto-dialing and
	redialing capability of the PMMI, Anchor, Hayes or Robotics, it
	works quite well on non-PMMI modems.  In the author's system a
	stock Bell 212A Dataphone is used together with a normal serial
	I/O that can be programmed to easily switch from 300 to 1200 bps.
	A great variety of other computers and modems can use this same
	program quite easily.  This is likely the most versatile phone
	modem programs currently available for CP/M users.


OUR THANKS TO:
-------------

     A great number of people have contributed to the growth of this
program since 1977.  Two people have been particularly helpful to me in
developing the MDM700 series modem programs:  Keith Petersen (W8SDZ)
and Frank Gaude' (ex-K6IBE).  Their help and interest have been greatly
appreciated.

     We hope this verstile program will give you hours of enjoyment and
fulfill your modem needs.
