			MSUP - Modem SUPervisor

	MSUP allows a CompuPro system with MPM86 or MPM8-16 to run
Communication software without loosing characters and allowing more than
one Modem to be used simultaneously. If only One COM channel is available,
or all are used by users on the system, the use of Mutual eXclusion queues
will prevent any other user from grabing the modem. MSUP was tested at speeds
of up to 19200 bps in file transfer modes and up to 2400 bps in ASCII mode
on a system with the 8085/88 Cpu board installed. Higher speeds may be possible
with the 8086 board and I sure would like to hear from anyone with a 80286 !

	Modem programs should of course make use of MSUP otherwise MSUP
doesn't do much good ! M8MPMIN.A86 is the source listing for the overlay
to go with MDM8xx and can be used with MDM8xx or adapted to work with another
8086 Modem program. (Also SYSMPM.A86 is available from the author to run
with the 16 bit version of MODEM901)


	Installing MSUP is a relatively simple procedure. After assembling
MSUP.A86 with ASM86 and generating MSUP.CMD with GENCMD, rename MSUP.CMD to
MSUP.RSP. Run GENSYS to generate a new MPM.SYS file and include MSUP.RSP.
Answer all the GENSYS questions as specified in the CompuPro MPM 8-16 manual
except for the Number of System flags which should be 51 with MSUP installed.
Next copy the terminal and printer option files TTYS and LPRS into the files
TTYSC and LPRSC respectively:

	PIP TTYSC=TTYS
	PIP LPRSC=LPRS

Do NOT INCLUDE THE CONSOLE NUMBERS to be used as communication channels in the
TTYS and TTYSC files as otherwise these channels will be used by MPM as
ordinary consoles. Last but not least create the file COMCH as per example 1
specifiying the Console numbers to be used as communication channels. After
booting MPM with MSUP installed, MSUP will print a message on the system
console indicating it is active. The creation of the new comm. channels can be
verified by running MPMSTAT and looking for the MXmodemN queues.

	If you have any problems installing MSUP.RSP and getting it to run
let me know.

	Example 1:    COMCH file format

		N: [Comment] <CR><LF>

	N = Console number to be used as Communication channel
	Comment is optional. Each line must be terminated
	by a Carriage Return, Line Feed sequence.
	The last line must be terminated by <CR><LF><EOF>
	(EOF is a Ctrl-Z).

	eg:

			2: Phone line 1
			3: Phone line 2
