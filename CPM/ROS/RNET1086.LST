                               List #08
                           October  1, 1986

  The SYSOPS utilizing ROS (Remote Operating System) have united their
efforts to better serve their users and formed the ROS NETWORK.   This
listing  provides both the ROS# and system information for each system
participating  as  of   OCT. 01, 1986.   On each of the  National  ROS
NETWORK systems, a file area named RNET1086.lbr will carry  this list,
a file named ROS-SYS.NEW for new system  applications , a  file  named
RNET1086.LTR , the ROS-NET newsletter.A file named ROSDIRxx.LBR where
xx denotes one of 6 US and 3 Canadian areas (NE,SE,SC,NC,SW,NW,EC,CC,
or WC) to make finding files on this huge system much easier will have
directories for the local area .

  The  main effort of the ROS NETWORK is to better support each of our
members  by providing a co-operative listing of files  available,  ROS
News  and program updates.   Each of the participating SYSOPS wish  to
express their gratitude for the outstanding contribution made by Steve
Fox.   From his unselfish expertise, time and talents, ROS was written
and placed into the Public Domain. There is now ROS-PC , a  share-ware
PC version of ROS.Most ROS-NET boards will have both versions available
for download and will aid in setting up ROS boards.

The  ROS NETWORK  is  to benefit the end user - to  that  end,  please
feel free to comment on any area which could serve you better.

Beginning with this net list, the version of ROS each member is
using will be listed with their system description. There is now a list
of boards previously running ROS and having ROS support files and lists
available.There is also a list of known ROS boards not yet on the  ROS-
NET.Any of these not wanting to be on the net at this time will have *
after the number.Any boards accessable by PC-PURSUIT will have ** after
the number.Please recruit any ROS boards you find or aid to start for
the ROS-NET and report any changes in your boards or the version you are
running to the area collection point.We are still looking for vollunteers
to be collection points for SC,NC,EC,CC,WC.

This is official notice that beginning with the November list any vacant
ROS-NET numbers will be re-assigned.All systems running ROS-PC will  be
noted as such.All others are running cp/m versions and any special changes
made by the sysop will be noted.If you have any changes not listed tell
us so we can list it and make it available for others to use.

To aid in the growth of the ROS-NET and to cut down on the cost of
transfering files to other ROS-NET sysops we should start taking
advantage of the PC-PURSUIT service provided Telenet.this is a night
and weekend program that for $25 sign-up and a flat $25 per month
provides unlimited use 6pm to 7am weekdays and all weekend.it provides
2-way service from the local calling areas of 14 cities nationwide
(Atlanta,Boston,Chicago,Dallas,Denver,Detroit,Houston,Los Angeles,
Newark,New York,Philadelphia,San Francisco,Seatle,Washington,DC)and
one way service from the local calling areas(unless you are willing
to call longdistance)of thousands of Telenet nodes.if you are not
in one of the 14 cities and want to see if you are in the local
calling area of a Telenet node call 1-800-368-4215 for info or to
sign up.in Va.(703) call689-5700.ROS#19 has a list of telenet nodes
also if you want to leave a message on his board.we should recruit
an easy to access board in one of those 14 cities to use as a
transfer point for the net.PC-PURSUIT membership will mean a sysop
can economicly obtain the latest files and transfer the ROS programs
to boards nationwide.there are a lot of boards that are little used
and the sysops would welcome more callers especialy sysops that share
files.to get free board listings and lists of local exchanges you
get 10 minutes free time on 2 info boards 1-800-835-3001 or
1-800-222-6021 24 hrs.these are Fido boards and are down for Fido-net
transfers in the wee hours.as soon as possible a library containing
a list of boards in the 14 cities,a two part list of local exchanges
in those areas,and a file called access that has instructions for using
a toll-free telenet service that gives listings of local telenet node
numbers in any area code you give,will be distributed to all ROS-NET
boards.the name of that library will PCP-INFO.LBR.

Because there are so many existing ROS boards that we have not contacted
we will attempt to list those names and numbers as we come accross them.
if you know of a board running any version of ROS please share the number
and make sure the sysop gets a current copy of RNETxx86.LBR.
