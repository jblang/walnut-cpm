When I bought a used NEC PC-8201A, it didn't come with a cassette 
cable. It did, however, come with some software on cassette, so I 
was inspired to build a cable.

This document will take you step-by-step through my elegant, (and 
inexpensive!) solution, converting a Tandy cable so that it works 
with the NEC. All parts are available at your local Radio Shack, 
and you need only know how to solder.


You'll need these parts:
Cassette Recorder Interface Cable, #26-1207    $5.95
8-pin DIN plug,                    #274-026    $1.79
                                               -----
                                       Total:  $7.74
And these tools:
[more]        Small screwdriver, needlenose pliers, soldering iron (low 
wattage), small rubberband (optional), voltmeter (optional).


1. Disassemble the cable's 5-pin DIN connector:

Lift the tab with the screwdriver and slide the cover up the 
cable. Separate the metal halves - one half will come free while 
the other is held to the cable. Carefully pry the strain relief 
open just enough to free the cable. Slide the clear insulation 
away from the pins.

2. Unsolder all the wires, and put aside the 5-pin connector.

3. Solder the wires to the 8-pin plug:

You will notice that the 8-pin plug is nearly identical to the 
5-pin connector you just set aside. You need only solder the five 
wires to the new connector as shown below; we will re-use the 
other parts. By the way, you may want to confirm the insultation 
colors (listed in the right column) by using your voltmeter to 
trace the wires to their connectors.

         (rear view)               (8)

If you look closely at the back of the connector, you may see the 
pin numbers.


Assembly tip: To make it easier to connect the wires, I wrap a 
small rubberband around the handle of my needlenose pliers, 
which I then use as a temporary clamp to hold the connector 
steady while I solder the wires to it.

[more]        4. Inspect your work, test the cable.

Make sure there are no cold solder joints, and above all, make 
sure nothing is touching pin 8! (When plugged into the PC-8201, 
pin 8 carries +5 volts). Once you're certain everything looks 
good, you may test the cable.

5. Re-assemble the connector:

Slide the clear insulation back over the solder connections. 
Press the connector into the metal half with the strain relief. 
Once it's aligned, use the pliers to bend the legs of the strain 
relief back onto the cable, being careful not to crush the cable.
Replace the second metal half, taking care to align the two small 
tabs with the slots in the other half. Then slide the cover over 
the metal halves until the cover's tab clicks into place.

6. You're done!

Now you have cassette cable for a NEC PC8201, and a 5-pin DIN 
connector left over.

[more]        There you have it - simple, elegant and inexpensive. Enjoy!
