These are ESCape codes that will be of most use to people designing VT100
graphics displays.  Not all of the codes are listed, just the most useful
ones.

Line Drawing Character Set

         mqvqj


Notes
-----
I highly recommend including the following sequence at the beginning of each
ANSI file:

               ESC[?2lESC<  

This makes the computer jump in and out of VT52 mode.  This resets all the
character sets to G0 designator (especially important) and everything else.
Using this will make sure the character sets show up only when they are
supposed to (no graphics characters when it's a text screen and vice versa).


On IBMs
-------
There are several ways to view these on an IBM PC.  To have ANSI codes work
locally (just TYPE the files and the displays appear) you can do several
things.

1.  Assign ANSI.SYS (free with PC-DOS) as a device driver.  Do this by putting
    this line in CONFIG.SYS:
 
        DEVICE=ANSI.SYS

2.  Download Fansi-Console (FCONSOLE) from any BBS that has it available,
    and install that as specified in the instructions.

To view the codes remotely, it's best to get a VT100 emulating terminal
program.  Many commercial programs have this option.  PC-VT, in the public
domain, was written explicitly for this emulation.  CrossTalk XVI, SmartCom II,
and PTel are some commercial programs with this support.

If you call direct, make sure you're using a VT100 emulator!
