!Walnut Creek CP/M CD-ROM Indexers	
i	
iThe Walnut Creek CP/M CD contains files in each directory called	
i00-INDEX.TXT, which contain a description of each file as well	
ias the size and timestamp. The software in this directory aims to	
iprovide various interface for browsing the files on the CD with an	
iinterface basically approximating that of the VIEW.EXE DOS program	
iincluded in the CD:	
i	
0index_gopher.py: converts 00-INDEX.TXT files to gophermap files	index_gopher.py	
i	
iLater, I may also implement the following:	
i	
iTelnet command-line interface for use with a terminal program on	
iplatforms that don't have a gopher browser.	
i	
iOldskool web interface that is basically a simulated gopher	
iinterface with <pre> formatted ASCII and links.
