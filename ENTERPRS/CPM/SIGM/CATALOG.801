SIG/M    Volume 801     SIG/M SAMPLER - Commodore 128 (Volume 2 of 2)
                        A Collection of Z80-8080 Favorites from
                        the SIG/M Library of Public Domain Software
   
         In most cases, source code is provided with all SIG/M soft-
         ware to allow the user to make any special modifications.We 
         also try to insure that compiled versions are on the disks
         for those of us who are non-hackers. We have not included
         any of the code for these programs so as to give you a 
         greater sample. All of the code is in the regular library
         (currently 256 Volumes).

	 SIG/M software is available on bulletin boards and through
         distribution points. A list of the principal sources is
         contained in the file REGIONS.SIG.  A printed catalog is
         available for $3.00 from SIG/M, Box 97, Iselin, NJ 08830.

         Most of the languages in the library (C, PILOT, etc.)
         should work on the Commodore. Any disk in the library can
         be ordered in Kaypro 4 format (the format of this disk) 
         and you should be able to at least read it on the 128.
         Many of the distributors have Kaypro 4 format available as
         do the commercial operators who, while not affiliated with
         SIG/M, make the software available at reasonable prices. For
         example, Dutsch Computer Service, 405 East 6th Avenue,
         Roselle, NJ 07203 (201-241-0719) charges $7.00 per volume
         (and donates $1.00 to SIG/M) with maxiumum two day shipping.
    
  
         Where a file is a LIBRARY file (end in .LBR) you will first
         have to remove the files from the library. There are two
         ways to remove files from the library. DELBR will extract
         all of the files. Tyle DELBR <filename> on a disk where 
         there is enough room for the files. 

         LU (Library Utility) on this disk will also remove files from    
         the libraries and can manipulate and create them. You can also
         extract files from a library on one disk to another disk.  
         Type LU to start. Then -O to open a file. Then type the name
         of the library file. To list a file type -L. Type -E to extract
         from a file. (*.* for all files, or names of files you want to
         extract - with wildcards if wanted). -R reorganizes. -A adds.
         -D deletes.  -C closes. To exit LU, hit enter twice.

         THIS IS A TEST DISK. PLEASE SEND YOUR COMMENTS, SUGGESTIONS
         AND IMPROVEMENTS TO:
